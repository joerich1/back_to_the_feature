The music of The Hollies’ “Jesus Was A Crossmaker” begins It’s a quiet stately song fit for an

ending And though this is only the beginning perbaps we sense something grand and final is
about to occur oe

backs into a close shot Mighty steel doors swing upward to reveal an entire truck full of shoe
boxes Many many boxes of shoes marked with a loud black stamp RECALL Camera slides
right as another gleaming truck opens its back doors to reveal similar cargo And another And
another Two dock-workers share a rueful knowing look

DOCK WORKER
(to the shoes)
Welcome back boys

They begin the task of unloading this colossal shipment

VOICE
As somebody once said there is a difference
between a failure

HIGH-ANGLE

Twenty-two trucks unloading the shoe boxes ‘We are on the outskirts of the gorgeous “campus”

ofa famous shoe company whose world headquarters are right here in the wilds of Oregon just
outside Portland

VOICE
and a fiasco

INT MERCURY SHOE CORPORATE HELICOPTER - DAY

DREW BAYLOR is 27 He sits ngidly upright a man facing his destiny even though he’s
seated backwards He’s the only passenger in this company helicopter whistling over the tops of
tall Oregon trees In the distance the magnificent Mount Hood Drew looks at the large open
side-window to the helicopter It beckons a tempting way out

The speck that is Drew now exits the still-whirring helicopter which has just touched down at the
top of the tallest building of this important-looking compound The voice continues helpfully calm
but resigned ra

VOICE
A failure is simply the non-presence of success
Any fool can accomplish failure

PILOT
Watch your head —

Drew looks upwards at the slicing helicopter blades

DREW

(unconvincing)
Im fine

r INT MERCURY SHOE HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Drew wears a security id badge as he walks the hallway Young powerful types all “casually”
dressed swivel back in chairs frozen in mid-meeting as they see him We know the look It’s our
own lock as we try hard not to gaze at a passing wreck on the highway

VOICE
But a fiasco

Drew arrives at another hallway juncture a little unsure of his direction He chooses the left path
He nods to people as he walks Our narrator’s thoughtful voice belongs to Drew of course and it
stands in great contrast to his deceptively cheerful public front

DREW’S VOICE
a“fiasco” is a disaster of mythic proportions A
fiasco is a folk-tale told to others that makes other
people feel more alive because it didn’t happen to them

DREW
(flatly)
I’m fine
4 INT MERCURY SHOES HALLWAY - DAY

Drew arrives at the desk of ELLEN KISHMORE 24 She’sa high-level assistant with great
C

a

style poise memorable green eyes and a few too many magazine photos of Jude Law on her
cubicle wall She greets Drew with a not-quite-disguised look of horrified concern Frankly she’s

shocked he’s still on two feet Just looking at Ellen almost comforts him Jo

DREW
(quietly)
I’m fine

At another time they would have made clever small-talk perhaps even openly discussed their
eighteen-month affair But there is no time for thatnow
Yll take you to Phil so you don’t get lost ’

INT CLOSED HALLWAY - DAY

Drew and Ellen zip down a cormdor on a cart Think about a long hallway at LAX the kind with
children’s artwork on the sides Replace the artwork with valuable masterpieces from American
painters and youve got the idea about this inner-sanctum passageway reserved for an elite few

DREW’S VOICE
Mercury Worldwide Shoes which is actually Phil
contains some of America’s finest artists’ masterworks
seen only by people heading for very important meetings
a promotion 7

Drew looks at Ellen with unabashed love The paintings zip by She looks at him with
increasingly distant affection

DREW’S VOICE
or otherwise

INT “THE PEN” - DAY

Drew and Ellen pass “The Pen” an open work-space filled with desks and employees Large
monitors fill every desk Such is the state of the new global workplace — all we see are the tops of
their heads (Visible are cutting-edge souvenirs and sign-posts of worldwide culture)

DREW’S VOICE
We are not just employees as Phil once said we are
“Denizens of Greatness”
r

“
NZ

SERIES OF SHOTS - DREW’S WORK WORLD
1) Drew at monitor studying the leg and foot movements of animals

DREW’S VOICE
Phil says — the world is full of those who coast through
life who achieve through negativity or thefi

2) Drew at a z00 studying the way a monkee jumps taking notes

DREW’S VOICE
We succeed through original thought But there
are sacrifices for a goal like pure greatness

3) On a calendar

DREW’S VOICE
birthdays major holidays

4) Drew’s family - father MITCH mother HOLLIE sister HEATHER her daughter ISIS

Family gather at a table for Christmas Drew absent is represented by a framed photo on a buffet
table and an empty seat

DREW’S VOICE
though we sometimes celebrate odd things at Mercury
like the day the Italians invented rubber Which they didn’t
of course but that’s beside the point

5) “The Pen” is transformed into a pseudo-kegger Drew a non-dancer dances wildly

6) Drew on escalator at office Shot splits into two then four screens then folds back into one

large think-tank where Drew studies media and culture from around the world

DREW’S VOICE
lonce went four days without speaking It was Janiastic

DREW
David How’s the weather

DREW’S VOICE
Each of us has a exact counterpart in the Region 3
Headquarters in Taiwan Mine is named David Tan
Every day we download thoughts to each other —
we are two sides of the same brain-trust

INT TAIWAN OFFICE - NIGHT
DAVID TAN 45 works long hours Just the topof his head is visible behind his monitor

DAVID TAN
Drew How’s the weather

INT PHIL’S OUTER OFFICE - DAY - PRESENT TIME

The cart slows to Phil’s outer office No words no sign proclaiming his name Just two frosted-
glass doors

DREW’S VOICE’
Any true student of functional shoe design is also a student
of Phil himself He is a master And his innate wisdom
of what people want and need has never failed to date
He is also obsessed with the number two

A matching set of two Norman Rockwell paintings adom the outer wall

DREW’S VOICE
These are Phil’s prized fro Norman Rockwells the

pair of paintings that once hung outside the White
House Office of John F Kennedy

We now see a matching set of two Security Guards in bulky jackets attempting not to look
ominous which of course makes them look more ominous Security Guard 1 (MEL) feels

Drew’s pain They’ ve bantered happily in the past Today Mel sends him a solemn silent message
of compassion

DREW
(with little conviction)
Im fine

DREW’S VOICE
And yes the two frosted doors Phil once purchased
from a church on a vacation in Tunisia and had
sent back home for a total cost too enormous to mention

763000 Each

Two Older Assistants - Moneypenny types -- sit at two desks nodding quietly as they listen over

headsets One of them holds up two fingers - as in not yel

ASSISTANT 1
Just two more minutes and I can send you in

Drew nods looking around killing time before his date with destiny

DREW’S VOICE
Because we have a moment here let me tell you that
lam a secret connoisseur of “last looks” The way
people look at you when they believe it’s for the
last time I collect these looks and

ASSISTANT 2

(interrupting voice-over)
Okay he’s ready for you

Ellen sends Drew through the two frosted doors

INT PHIL’S OFFICE - DAY

Drew looks back to see Ellen quietly disappear on the other side of these frosted doors

DREW’S VOICE
there’s one night now

It somehow feels quite significant Drew is now utterly alone Well almost alone Phil’s large
office is sunlit wide-open and inside it time bas stopped There is a collection of deeply-
comfortable brown-leather chairs two large-screen televisions featuring state-of-the-art video

games abandoned in mid-pursuit and at the far end comer a sun-bathed figure sits thoughtfully
looking out at the trees Phil is waiting

left a large-screen computer monitor giugs with the sound of a screen-saver aquarium
PHIL
How are you Drew

DREW
1 wanted to jump out the window of that helicopter
and just splatter on the trees to tell you the truth

PHIL
(half-hearted)
Don’t do that It’s only money

and somehow Drew knows to approach carefully To his
( )

And it is rather clear in his cadence that money is maybe the only important thing in Phil’s world
Drew bas not been invited to sit in the empty chair next to Phil so he stands A young man ina
very very large space If only he knew what to do what to say But he doesn’t Phil takes a
single sip from each of two cups of tea that sit before bim

Jt PHIL
The American psyche is in turmoil And we
have miscalculated

DREW
Tm sorry

PHIL ot
T have no rule-book for this situation
(blankly)
They tell me were about to lose 972 million dollars
I’m ill-equipped in the philosophies of failure

INT INDOOR GYMNASIUM DAY

They walk together on the upper

pro-Basketball team works out

Phil pauses briefly to regard these fine athletes

PHIL
My basketball team They don’t even know yet

INT COURTYARD - DAY

Phil and Drew arrive in an indoor arboretum courtyard The expanse of this company
headquarters is consistently surprising

DREW
l understand you have to let me go

PHIL
(it’s understood)
How do I make the concept of 972 million dollars
more real to you

DREW
It is very real to me Phil

This we know as Phil begins to talk He is a fan of his own mellifluous voice particularly as he
discusses the subject of money

PHIL
(thoughtful)
Well It’s the operating budget of a mid-size
country A small civilization It’s big it’s so big
that you could round it off to a billion dollars
(beat)
I cry a lot lately

DREW
In every possible way I feel responsible

PHIL
(really not listening)

A hugely-successful American company built by my own

family the blood of my own family merging last year

with DCS Industries on the promise of a global future

pinned to a groundbreaking shoe -- your design — with a

new style of material launched this week to great fanfare
f and now meeting a growing international roar of laughter

and rejection enough to cause this memo from Jeffrey Barlow

CEO of DCS “this once highly-anticipated product may

actually cause an entire generation to return to bare feet”

We are about to enter a free-fall plunge And the sound you

hear is the sound of shit hitting the fan globally

Drew is stricken For a moment we hear the whistling sound of wind

DREW
1 wish there was something I could do

PHIL

Actually there is

(with suspicious compassion)
Sitting in a room downstairs is a reporter from
Modern Business Journal He’s one of the good
guys Hell help us if he can The story of our
recall will break in a week this Monday and
you know whatever you want to say — within
parameters — would be wonderful

») Drew takes it in He is a loyal warrior to the end
PHIL
For example we need him to understand We
hired you from our National Scholarship program
We supported invested in your brilliance This
was a very creative endeavor
t (pause)
And I think you should stand up for your incredible work

Drew stares at his once fatherly role-model Now Phil is all reflective surface a false front of
support It looks like another last look unmistakably so

‘DREW

(as in goodbye)
Thank you
PHIL
You okay

Drew slowly nods He wants to say “Im fine” but can’t quite get there

INT MERCURY SHOES HALLWAY - DAY
Drew arrives at the conference room door flanked by Ellen and Mel (Security Guard 1) It feels
like an execution and in fact itis Drew stands at the door Inside the Reporter waits Drew

fooks down the long hallway and considers running for freedom It’s too late

DREW
Well Ellen

He’s about to say “wish me luck”

ELLEN
Drew Phil asks that you not talk about him at all

REW
At all

ELLEN

(takes a breath)
He wants you to take all the credit -

DREW

You were wearing that jacket the first time I met you -

Ellen smiles distantly Quietly a lover’s negotiation

ELLEN
Are you going back tonight

DREW
No I was gonna stay that was the plan right us ‘

ELLEN
Plans change Drew

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Drew faces the gimlet-eyed reporter HERBIE GONSALVES 46 a poker-faced professional

On the table before them are Drew’s conceptual drawings of the now-infamous shoe It is a boldly

designed shoe with a very wide base festooned with criss-crossing colorful designs We notice
‘ it’s name in the sketches — Spasmotica Nearby a copy of last week’s Modern Business Journal

REPORTER
And did Phil approve the designs and work closely
with you on The Spasmotica

DREW
(glumly)
Actually it’s pronounced “Spaas-motica”

REPORTER
Of course there’s an “umlaut” — Im sorry
So it’s “spizz” or “spowze”

DREW
(evenly)
He set me free to do whatever I wanted

The Reporter looks at Drew with pen suspended over a small-sized notebook The smell of
corporate violence is in the air The pack needs to devour a wounded animal Gonsalves offers
one final chance for survival before writing a death sentence

his destiny

INT MERCURY HEADQUARTERS - AFTERNOON

Ellen lingers a bit putting a fresh security id badge on a handsome new Recruit as Drew passes

DREW
(to Ellen) —
Hey so —

Ellen doesn’t even look at Drew He tums to see her hand seductively guide his replacement down
the corridor The movement of her hand on the recnuit’s back is mesmerizing in its brutal message
This is what it feels like to be erased

ON GLASS JAR

Drew drops his security badge into the container by the exit It clinks with finality

ON DREW

watching Ellen walk away He knows he’s supposed to leave with dignity knows this with every

bone in his body but instead giving way to feelings of disbelief and anxiety he moves in the
opposite direction towards her

realize how this is coming off

Ellen turns the panic of public embarrassment in her eyes Two Mercury Guards now flank Drew

oblivious employees move past him ‘

This is the solitary existence of a man who
stacks of video games and two framed

Spasmotica prototypes (in different stages of painstaking development) on the wall A laptop
glows with a Spasmotica screensaver and some sketches sit on a small kitchen table He sets
down his things He takes a look around lets out a breath Home sweet home

INT DREW’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Drew’s kitchen drawer opens taking theme

He admires the clean efficiency of his suicide machine Clearly anyone seated in this machine will
be the victim of a special kind of Hari-Kari It works It’s perfect He turns it off Ah but one
thing is missing and he knows what it is Drew exits and returns with a pair of the villainous

Spasmoticas He ties the laces together and hangs them from the handlebars This is perfection

EXT DREW’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

With the decision has come freedom With an almost skip in his step Drew places box of his
clothes a wicker chair the television videos camera and all his belongings by the trash bins
behind his apartment

INT DREW’S APARTMENT — NIGHT — MINUTES LATER

Drew climbs into the seat The place is neat and empty Now gripped with a real sense of
purpose he regards the “on” switch We hear a very subtle chirp an innocuous ascending ring
It’s the hushed reminder that his cell-phone rests on the table n

earby It’s not hard to ignore so he
does The call goes to voice-mail with a final beep
ON THE GAFFER’S TAPE

which weakens as the knife begins to droop Drew adjusts the knife adding more gaffer’s tape

He is now completely focused and utterly centered The phone chirps again Drew doesn’t hear it
as he takes a breath

ON THE ON SWITCH

his finger rests on it

And finally Drew becomes aware of the continuing ring With zen-like calm he rises and brings
the phone back to his seat He is completely at peace almost cheerful

INT ANOTHER SECURITY AREA — NIGHT

The two Guards search and interrogate Drew as a third silent Guasd in fatigues sits watching with
a machine gun at his side From time to time he taps information into an open laptop

GUARD 2 7
You made this plane reservation at the last minute

DREW
It’s a family emergency

Guard 1 casts a knowing glance over at Guard 2 the “family emergency” line Guard 2
finds a small pair of scissors and shows it to Guard 1 They look at each other meaningfully —
the case against Drew is growing They regard the tiny weapon like a bomb of epic proportions

GUARD 2
You’ re traveling with this -

Take it
GUARD 1
Have you ever attended school overseas
DREW
One semester in Germany

The Guards openly share their most powerful look yet They look at the two very different suits in

Drew’s garment bag One is a standard issue The other is The Blue Suit It immediately

fascinates them It’s not quite in fashion strangely anonymous Purposely anonymous The
Guards flick looks to each other

GUARD 2

men large and small A silent moment passes between them Guard 2 gives Drew a sympathetic
pat on the shoulder Guard 3 holds out the plastic container with the Beautiful You baggie

Claire responds to his signal in her unique way — by ignoring it She leans closer She is an intent
listener nodding slightly collecting information like a detective assembling clues to a murder

CLAIRE

Where does he live in Louisville

DREW
f ) Actually he’s near Louisville
He pronounces it like the rest of the world “Louie-ville” She corrects him like a native

CLAIRE

Lou-a-ville He’s in Elizabethtown

CLAIRE
Good 1 hope someone is driving you because the
roads around there are hopelessly and gloriously
confusing Lou-a-vull

DREW

He smiles pleasantly with absolute good manners and claims his privacy by politely shutting the
overhead light off

She hesitates and then clicks his light back on

The name “Ellen” is troubling to both of them

CLAIRE

She gives him the map

DREW

Close
She detects a trace of something
CLAIRE
He’s okay right
DREW

Yeah He’s

She nods sage-like ever the student of names Drew swallows once contemplates saying “dead”

for the first time in connection with his father

She shrugs it off as she reaches for his garment bag

CLAIRE

gingerly She looks at the suit looks back at Drew who finally shuts the light off She turns away -

private and heartfelt advice

He tums and exits quickly She watches him for five-and-a-half steps She can’t help it

At last Drew powers forward Music

SHOTS OF ELIZABETHTOWN

A red-and-purple sky The still blazing late afternoon sun presses against the windows of his rent-

cuts through Elizabethtown first lined with a row of small businesses then more residential

flags Drew drives past the Train Museum actually a well-kept locomotive in a gravel field
Kids on the street wave him in point him ahead One kid on a blue bike wearing goggles joins
bim as an escort A silver-haired woman on a porch watches his car pass Other kids wave at
him On another front lawn a teenage girl jumps on a trampoline We pass Clay County High
School where girls basketball practices outside More residents line the sidewalks waving him

forward All now cheering and pointing him onward a few more blocks to his destination He is
quite clearly and quite famously late Music continues

EXT ELIZABETHTOWN FUNERAL HOME LATE AFTERNOON

Drew puils into the crunchy gravel parking lot by a brown-brick one- e-story building The parking

Through his side window Drew sees a youngish man slightly older than himself He’s leaning on
the front fender of a hatchback He looks enormously happy to see Drew He is JESSIE
BAYLOR 31 Drew squints into the sun Takes a breath He opens the door and emerges from
a this the last in a series of protective air-conditioned capsules that have deposited him here

) EXT ELIZABETHTOWN FUNERAL HOME -— LATE AFTERNOON

Drew officially sets foot in the South

He is met with an otherworldly heat a deep humidity and the resounding roar of cicadas All the
smells and the lushness of the Southern summer immediately crowd his lungs He has been to a
few distant places even Europe for a summer but nothing has felt so far from home as this
Somewhere a-bell clangs The blinding sun cuts through some trees to blur his vision for a
moment Shading his eyes he sees Jessie approaching swiftly crunching loudly on the gravel
Hoisting up the garment bag Drew meets him halfway A light urgency is in the air

JESSIE
a This loss will be met by a hurricane of love

D) and you are staying with me

Jessie walks Drew through a tree-shaded path to the Funeral Home’s adjacent cemetery Jessie is
immediately tactile and preps Drew like a Senator’s aide whispering loudly in his ear
JESSIE

Okay Cuz I’m going to take care of everything

You remeber Uncle Dale ‘Youre going to meet

Charles Dean who was a good old friend of your

Daddy’s PS you met all these people when you

were very small Don’t worry I will not leave your side

They trudge up a small hill to a plot of land Jessie presents Drew with pride and relief to have
somebody new in town who is roughly his age

JESSIE ‘
Charles Dean Meet the grown up Drew Baylor

Here is CHARLES DEAN 62 a local institution His face resembles a natural rock formation

DREW
Thank you My condolences

JESSIE
And you remember Uncle Dale

(UNCLE) DALE BAYLOR 56 is Mitch’s younger brother and Jessie’s father He too is

regional through-and-though though flecked with regret at his own lack of wanderlust The men
all gravely shake hands Drew remembers none of them

EXT ELIZABETHTOWN CEMETERY PLOT LATE AFTERNOON -

The men stand near a patch of green lawn

CHARLES DEAN
Here is Mitch’s plot It’s been in your family for
272 years 1 have always endeavored to keep
this area clear for your Daddy

DREW
(beat)
We are still discussing that issue There is a
possibility of cremation

The mention of cremation lands hard Charles Dean visibly freezes looks are exchanged

A gust
of wind blows
)

CHARLES DEAN
Well for now the question is do you want an open or
a closed casket 7

Drew shifts body language The big questions are arriving quickly

DREW
Closed

CHARLES DEAN
You’re sure

DREW

Yes He was a private man

Charles Dean and Dale share a brief look Drew feels there’s something he’s missing

CHARLES DEAN
(tightly)

Okay so closed
DREW

Yes

Charles Dean presents a small open box with a few of Mitch’s valuables

CHARLES DEAN
His wallet —

Drew looks at the lonely familiar Brown Wallet

DREW
The Brown Wallet

CHARLES DEAN
And his ring from West Point I’m assuming you’ll
want it on

Yes He was very proud of West Point

CHARLES DEAN
And I did already dress him in a wonderful brown suit

You take a look at the brown and decide later

An uncomfortable beat passes

DREW - -

DREW cor Paes pry
Blue

Charles Dean nods reluctantly

CHARLES DEAN
And do you want a closed casket or an open casket

Drew looks slightly puzzled Wasnt this just settled
DREW

(carefully)
Closed

A long beat of silence Looks are exchanged

DALE
(delicately)

Drew I think what Charles Dean wants to say is ‘
your daddy’s friends might be disappointed
if they can’t see him again Theyd probably
be disappointed if it was closed for the Viewing

(aside to Charles Dean)
Is Bill Banyon coming ‘

CHARLES DEAN
1 don’t think so we havent

Dale nods relieved The issue evaporates

DREW

INT NEARBY CHAPEL ROOM — LATE AFTERNOON

A door swings open to a back chapel filled with people Charles Dean presents Drew grandly as
J Drew looks at the small sea of unfamiliar faces all of them dressed smartly and respectfully He
feels their eyes sizing him up
CHARLES DEAN
Everybody this is Mitch’s Boy from California of the
California Baylors This is Drew He’s going to spend
some time alone with his daddy and then well all join him
Drew youre related to just about everybody here and just
as your father was we’re all very excited about your
eight-year triumph with that beautiful shoe

Drew looks at their sincere and curious faces and sees pieces of recognizable noses and eyes
elements of his father’s looks all different spins on the same gene pool He is not a public

speaker Do they expect him to speak Jessie leans over and whispers in Drew’s ear

JESSIE
Youre going to need to say a little something
from your heart
Ail eyes are now on Drew Stiffly
DREW

Thank you for being here Sorry Im late
He looks at their faces It’s not enough Awkward adrenalin courses through him

Only the upper-half of the coffin is open An American flag is folded on the bottom-half of the

casket Charles Dean appears at Drew’s other side

The sight is rather overwhelming to Drew A buman body His father without breath Behind
him Charles Dean assumes The Pose Head down hands clasped pastoral He is after all an

expert mourner Drew tums to him as if up until this moment it all could have been a-terrible
mistake

DREW

(quietly)
There he is

It’s an enormously intimate moment He draws closer to the side of the casket He passes

through many emotions ending on a slightly perplexed look Charles Dean notices an oddness i in
Drew’s reaction

CHARLES DEAN
Did I not capture your Daddy

Drew is silent He continues looking now curious

DREW
I don’t know what the word is It’s just a look 1
never saw before A look on his face

CHARLES DEAN
Too solemn

DREW
No I was going to say

He tusns to look at Charles gauging the older man’s feelings

DREW
Maybe not solemn enough

CHARLES DEAN
(quietly defensively)
He was a fun guy

DREW
Okay but — this is — this is — what’s the word

CHARLES
Whatever you wish If you saw him differently

DREW
No I just P’ma little tired —

Drew nods — maybe so — and tums back to his father

CHARLES DEAN
If you move around a bit you’ ll see different aspects

Drew knows he’s hurt the man’s feelings

DREW SS
It’s good I just wish I could think of the word

I like it I like the way he looks You did a great
job Thank you

Drew looks briefly at Charles Dean — this is all a bit personal as Charles slips a box of Kleenex
on the side of the casket Drew nods politely Charles nods solemnly and pulls a reluctant Jessie
with him
ON DREW

looking down at his father The improbable word comes to him

DREW
Whimsical The word is whimsical

ON MITCH

who looks like he’s been interrupted in mid-joke We hear music the introduction to the song
that will play through this and the next sequence Drew moves around the coffin looking closely

In small ways assisted by the lighting in this room the expression actually does change in small
but seemingly infinite variations ‘

DREW
Hey — why not Whimsical

Drew stares He reaches forward carefully and touches the knuckles on his father’s fingers They
are hard and cold He keeps looking at that face the odd upbeat expression as he stands alone in

the large room with Mitch Drew tilts bis head and moves to various vantage points to stare more
carefully at his father as music continues

INT AUNT DORA’S KITCHENHOME - EVENING
A burstof human interaction The small house is packed with flowers fiends relatives and food
A high-pitched intensity swirls around Drew And he just happens to bein the beating heart of this
home — the kitchen With Jessie Baylor at his side Drew is given a plate With a large piece of
yellow pie (Chess Pie a regional favorite) by 65 year-old silver-blonde (AUNT) DORA
CONNELLY Dora represents the cheerful side of the family a grandchild-loving powerful stalk
ofa woman LENA her older sister moves nearby always the co-hostess (Lena “How’s your
mother how’s Hollie”) Drew watches the unspoken synchronicity of these cooks moving
swiftly holding plates of food never bumping into each other as they expertly cook for many
They have swung into action Three people talk to Drew simultaneously one a tearful shy
girlfriend (CONNIE) of his father’s from a long time ago She slips a high-school picture of Mitch
into his hands All around him he sees bits and pieces of facial similarities Music continues as
we see a portrait of Southern culture the likes of which is entirely foreign to Drew

SERIES OF SHOTS

(Note Drew is rarely if ever alone in frame)

1) Guests talk with Drew as he moves from the packed kitchen Our view is partially obscured by
the backs of others He’s given an Ale-8 a soft-drink in a deep-green glass bottle Many hold
similar bottles “It’s a regional drink it’s like Mountain Dew with a kick” says Jessie They love
seeing him drink it “No it’s good” Drew says The guests eager to talk to the visiting star are
too close to his face Behind him on the walt is a Praying Hands sculpture Moving in the close
environment he knocks down the Praying Hands and is given that too along with more photos of
his father Someone’s voice says poimtedly “We always wanted to know you better”

2) All burners on the stove are operating at full-biast Hush puppies Cor fritters Chicken
and nearby

3) A table with Ham A four-year old boy pops into the shot He’s got fiery mischief in his eyes
He is SAMSON BAYLOR and he eyes the ham with intent He too holds an Ale-8 and is
already chewing something else Drew meets another Cousin “Uncle Mitch always wanted us to
meet Everybody says we look alike” There is only the vaguest similarity

4) Aunt Dora is assured that Bill Banyon is not showing up She appears mightily relieved (The

words “Bill Banyon” should become more and more prevalent as in “Thank God Bill Banyon isn’t
coming”)

5) UNCLE ROY 56 and skinny is asleep in the living rcom with television on dreaming an old
man’s dreams Nearby Teenagers beset with long faces and light acne fumble with an impossible

group of remote controls none of which seem to help operate a new TIVOVCR system

6) Drew moves through the main part of the house toward the living room and he spots Samson

fy

43
by the ham Jesse introduces Drew to a pretty 16 year-old girl whispering “Mona is a stare-er”
We meet MONA who has a very compelling stare Just as Samson feels he’s not being watched
he slips the ham off the table and lets two nearby dogs erupt into a dogfight over it Samson
escapes unseen as the dogs are blamed Aunt Lenasays “Jennifer get the dogs out of here”
Uncle Roy sleeps through it all ‘

7) The ham is quickly rescued washed and re-dressed
8) Dora pulls out a Ginzu knife and starts cutting the ham as Drew stands nearby The blade is ©
familiar to Drew and he looks at it like a lover with whom he still has a planned rendevous Jessie
whispers in Drew’s ear throughout always informing him of the players and the playing field

9) Jessie attempts to confiscate an Ale-8 from Samson’s hands Samson wriggles away
10) Camera catches some of the memorabilia and photos being handed to Drew

11) Sad guy just sitting there holding a cigarette looking sad

12) Samson unravels scotch tape sees bananas looks subversive

13) Teenagers by the television continue to struggle Others are now enlistedto try and fix the
TIVOVCR

14) Drew easily fixes the complicated remote control system and he meets a local star Basketball
Player girl (still wearing jersey)

15) Samson wedges the banana in the spigot of the pantry water-dispenser

16) Twin teenage girls show offa dance routine which cheers up some of the more obviously
grieving elders “a

17) Samson screams next to Uncle Roy and wakes him up as he runs out the front door Uncle

Roy asks absently “Is Bill Banyon here” A chorus comforts him “No probably not” Uncle Roy
goes back to sleep

18) Drew is still surrounded by friends and family all offering condclences Uncle Dale arrives to
say “easy now he’s been through a lot and just “cause his daddy liked to talk doesn’t mean hé

does” Behind Dale a car backs down the driveway “Dale isn’t that your car Who’s in that
car” “Where are my keys”

19) Jessie comes out of the bathroom “What’s going on” Aunt Dora feeds him beans froma

spoon Like a child “It’s your son He flooded the closet with the water dispenser And right
now he’s driving Dale’s car”

behavior ‘ o

INT AUNT DORA’S HOUSE NIGHT - LATER

There is an immediate ripple Someone has seen him turning up the walkway A moment later
BILL BANYON 54 walks in the front door Everything about him screams — mid-level slickster
He’s untrustworthy not as brilliant as he believes he is and clearly arrogant But here’s the catch
He’s fun Rumor and innuendo becomes him He simply has no shame as he announces

BILL BANYON a
So you obviously made a group decision not to
call and invite me

Beat No one responds Banyon explodes into a smile extending a hand to the first stranger he
sees moving through the crowd like a politician with a checkered background

BILL BANYON ©
Hi Bill Banyon ‘ ao
(moving through crowd)

I hear Drew Baylor is here how you doing
how you doing Bill Banyon

Banyon spots a woozy Samson He kneels down to him
BILLBANYON - ‘
Is this Samson How you doing Samson

Give me a Big Boy’s hug —

Jessie and Drew watch as Samson rewards Banyon with the entire contents‘of-an upset stomach
The splatter hits Banyon and to a much lesser degree carpet and linen

BILL BANYON
Okay Okay then okay nice to see you too

His face locked into detached bemusement Drew absorbs the emotional cacophony of human
behavior swirling around him

EXT AUNT DORA’S HOME NIGHT

The windows and doors of the house are wide open as the living room is aired out Out of
necessity the dinner bas moved outdoors The house looks beautiful lit from within

ON JESSIE NEARBY

JESSIE
How you holding up

EXT NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT -

Drew and Jessie jog through the center of the street an unlikely looking pair weighed down with
stuff Drew tightly holds his bag a few artifacts food-containers and the Praying Hands Jessie
holds his son asleep and slung over his shoulder On either side there is the blue glow of houses
lit up by living room television It feels good to be moving again away from the crowd They

arrive at Jessie’s small house Samson is still asleep over Jessie’s shoulder A few fireflies snap
and buzz

DREW
Beautiful night does it ever cool off

No This time of year — it’s hotter than the
hinges of hell We got stars though

She’s pretty broken up She sends her love
to everybody though

Tessie nods he knows the subtext

JESSIE
I don’t blame her Around here their favorite thing
in the world is to get offended by something small
and hold onto it for fifty years

2 Drew smiles at his outspoken cousin and nods as in - better get to bed

aN

JESSIE
But then you and your dad were close

As Drew watches Jessie slaps pajamas on the sleepy kid
DREW
Oh very close I knew him very very well He was my
Dad We were actually going to drive here together
this year and it became next year and no I knew him
very well Very very well °

And it’s obvious in the extra beat we stay on Drew that he didn’t know his father well af all

INT MUSICGUEST ROOM - NIGHT
Jessie shows Drew the guest room which also functions as an “office” Shelves of toys and knick-

knacks share space with band equipment broken boom boxes concert tickets a concert poster on
the wall And a lonely-looking futon

DREW
(tired)
This will be perfect I love it I can sleep anywhere
JESSIE
You in my house man This is great The

circumstances are no great But we are cousins
brother Brother we are cousins That was my band

Jessie points out the poster as he pulls out pillows and clears kid toys from the floor (Jessie is
clearly a big kid with toys trying to raise a smaller kid with toys)

ON POSTER
it reads Winchester Summerfest featuring Lynyrd Skynyrd
JESSIE
This is the show we opened for Lynyrd Skynyrd ‘

Two of the original members

DREW
Cool —

JESSIE
Well we almost opened for ‘em It’s really a long

Jessie nods proudly and quietly as Drew looks over some memorabilia from the failed band

DREW
And now you fix computers

spontaneously acappella a verse from his own composition “Same in Any Language” Drew
listens uncomfortably unsure how to respond or where to look af Jessie sings

“Those postcards I sent from Birmingham
All the way from the windows of Amsterdam
Copped a gram from Dapper Sam

INT MUSICGUEST ROOM — LATER NIGHT
Window pane shadows slash the darkened room A fluttering almost-human form moves across
the room (It’s the front porch flag’s shadow) Drew hears a low scratching noise It’s an old

leafless tree that scrapes across the window in the wind The branch scrapes again Drew
imagines

HOLLIE’S VOICE
“His spirit is still hovering looking for a place
to land “

Another other-worldly sound now catches his attention It’s just next door Now the leafless tree
branch scrapes again The other-worldly whine grows louder from behind the wall We begin to
realize that it’s actually Debbie And now we hear Jessie’s sounds of pleasure The wind kicks
up and the tree branch scrapes insistently Drew now bears a mournful banshee wail It’s
Samson howling from the next room Getting louder For a few long moments all are in
syncopation Drew rises on an elbow

Music begins the perfect song that might pop up somewhere on a great date and forever become a
souvenir of the occasion except we are in the incongruous setting of

INT HADLEY CREMATORY (LOUISVILLE) —- DAY ‘

Arow of Ums All different sizes and shapes Moving shots of Drew and Claire examining all the
different possibilities A YOUNG WORKER looks on appreciatively not used to someone as
colorful and lively as Claire in this world that is very much about the opposite As music
continues she tums this potentially lugubrious task into an expjosion of life Each looking at
opposite walls of choices Drew and Claire back into each other unintentionally — it’s their first
physical contact They separate The Young Worker tums his attention to an older couple who
enter Behind his back Claire playfully flings one of the urns across the room to Drew laughing
When the grieving older couple tum to look at Claire she’s already serious and respectfully

monochromatic Drew and the Young Worker share a look The Young workers expression is
this — why you and not me wu

Now Claire explores a row of oil paintings of benefactors imitating each of their expressions even

a famous Kentucky racehorse Claire finds a small flag and eventually she and Drew arrive from

different directions in front of one very idiosyncratic Purple Urn She grabs it and poses Drew on
a viewing bench with the Um and the flag She takes an imaginary snapshot Drew hands the Urn
to the Young Worker The selection has been made And somehow surprisingly Drew shares a
look with her that could only be described as disbelief he’s actually just had fun

YOUNG WORKER
Just need your signature there and you can
cick this up tomorrow after the procedure

EXT HADLEY CREMATORY (LOUISVILLE) — LATER DAY

Drew and Claire walk together outside under the shady oaks that line this mock-colonial mansion
that houses the “resting grounds” Music trails off

DREW
Look —I’m—I’m not sure I feel comfortable
having fun

She looks at his serious face and cracks up He looks right and left Whats so funny

DREW
I am serious I’ve got nothing but problems

CLAIRE u
Alright Let’s work through ‘em One by one
Im good at this

DREW ‘
I think there’s only one problem and it’s everything

CLAIRE
Come on — one by one --

DREW
For starters My dad’s dead And we were
supposed to get to know each other better
) as adults next year

CLAIRE
You’re dealing with it It happens

DREW
My mom wants cremation They don’t do
cremations in Elizabethtown

CLAIRE
Not a problem

Drew gets up to grab a missing utensil She swivels and studies him and his every word

DREW
There’s an expensive Memorial coming up
(unconvincing)
Not that money is an issue of course —

CLAIRE

(waves it away)
Itll all work out

y He sits down

DREW
And can’t make an attachment here because Pm
just going to disappoint you ix a very profound way
So I think today is pretty much the sum total of us

They study each others faces

CLAIRE
Youre right It’s everything
(leans forward with mock panic)
It’s a complete disaster You have no choice but
to give up completely
(beat)
But we do have tonight ‘

He looks at her She’s immovably positive

EXT GREENBELT — NIGHT
They walk back to the parking lot There is an errant sprinkler and they must adapt

DREW
Youre kind of great Claire You do know that
Sort of amazing even

CLAIRE
Come on J don’t need an ice-cream cone

DREW
It’s not an ice-cream cone

(beat)

What’s an ice-cream cone

CLAIRE
You know “here’s a little something to make you
happy’ Something sweet that melts in five
minutes ’m completely cool with anything you
want to say or not say I don’t need it

He smiles He likes her language

CLAIRE
Besides Ben is coming in tomorrow night

They reach her car She rummages through her purse The moonlight is beautiful We hear the
sounds of others across the lake Anybody else would be kissing by now
CLAIRE
You want to hear my theory
DREW
‘Course

CLAIRE -
You and J have a special talent and I saw it immediately ‘

DREW
Tell me

CLAIRE

DREW

(admires her language)
“Substitute People”

CLAIRE
I’ve been the Substitute Person my whole life I’m not
an Ellen I never wanted to be an Ellen And I’ve never
been a Cindy either although Chucks love me -

DREW
I’m sure they do

L like being alone too much I’m with a guy -

who is “married” to his academic career — 1 rarely

it that way It’s a lot Jess pressure

DREW
T get it

CLAIRE
(confiding realizing)
My parents wanted a boy Im even the Substitute
Person to them Until the real thing shows up Im
a very very good Substitute Person

Drew enjoys the oddness of her thought process They exchange a look

CLAIRE
But if we kiss I mean really Kiss 1 know that
just being the Substitute won’t be enough anymore

She hands him the video from her purse suddenly she’s a little emotional

CLAIRE
Here play this for the loudest kid in the world
DREW
I’m not used to girls like you
CLAIRE

(covering)
That’s because I’m one of a kind

DREW
You don’t have to make a joke I like you
without the jokes

CLAIRE
Get some sleep I have a Personnel Interview
tomorrow morning and if get transferred Ben will die

They still don’t move Almost kissing All around her the mood and lighting and wind and
everything is perfect

DREW
Well let’s let him live

It is that moment and neither move any closer They are poised at the edge of breaking the

personal barrier neither wanting to be the first to move forward or away They almost kiss He
looks at her lips Theme begins in the form of an intoxicating piano part everything willing them

to give in to the romantic abandon

CLAIRE
Doesn’t it just feel better That we didn’t just --

DREW
Yeah

CLAIRE

— do something impulsive I mean now we actually
have a shot at being friends for the rest of our lives

They chuckle with feigned appreciative relief

What do deserve

Drew looks at her moves behind her as she faces camera (He is unseen by her)

DREW
You deserve

Lost for the words himself he picks up a piece of paper from the Hasboro Wedding Rehearsal
table

DREW
You deserve a guy who says “I can’t imagine
a world without you “

a little woozy with the pleasure of it all and then pulls away reluctantly
DREW
Please don’t take this as rejection

CLAIRE
T really don’t

He finds her mouth and there is no way back They sink to the ground as he places the urn
recklessly on a table And this is what its like to really kiss her After an interval they pull away
They sit there on the floor disheveled Claire looks up at the um on the table Claire is a little

light-headed Clearly it was a great kiss They are on the floor They regard each other and the
sudden difference between them There is silence for a moment

INT HOTEL BALLROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Drew pulls the curtain aside just a litile and we are allowed a surreptitious look at the arriving
crowd It’s a huge turn-out Crowd members many dressed formally have arrived early and are
already filling the ballroom He smiles at the charm and ritual that so defines this town

SERIES OF SHOTS

1) The Military Band plays at the side of the ballroom near the stage
2) Guests look at large postersof Mitchell Baylor displayed around the lobby on easels
3) Guests looking at the program booklet

4) Samson is dressed in a little man’s suit which he’s pulling and tugging at uncomfortably as he
watches Jessie set up his drums with other band members (behind the curtain) Samson climbs on
the drum kit and plays-a little

5) A slide projector clicks images on a screen in front of the curtain Balloons and flowers are
everywhere in this large beautifully-outfitted ballroom All the best of intentions are in play And
the gathering crowd feels it Something great could happen tonight

INT BALLROOMMEMORIAL STAGE - NIGHT

We meet a series of speakers who express their feelings of leve and regret Their comments aff

such displays of emotion)

INT BALLROOM PODIUM - NIGHT MINUTES LATER

Hollie rises and begins walking to the stage In every public event a crowd craves some kind of
drama This is drama She walks resolutely from her front row seat to the podium Hollie
takes the stage in a dark pant-suit with flared bottoms She stands at the microphone just the
spotlight a silver sun in her face There is silence save for the light but pervasive sound of

sniffling Hundreds of unseen faces now judge her in the darkness She takes a breath
The spotlight feels hot and it crosses her line of vision She’s blinded for a short time There is a
single judgmental-sounding cough in the dark

HOLLIE
Ima little nervous but here we are

Silence C

HOLLIE
Thanks for coming and thank you for inviting me
I’m glad I got on that plane It’s been a while

(beat)
He talked so much about all of you and late at night
Id often hear the typing ofone of his dong detailed
letters answering a simple question in 30 single-spaced
pages Always on Saturday that was his day to type
letters Saturday was the day he devoted to you And
how right that today is a Saturday

SHOT OF KNOWING LOOK
on an on-lookers face

HOLLIE
And there was the shorthand of a long marriage
We were complete opposites — and it worked

Hollie withdraws the microphone from the podium stand and begins to walk (She is the first to
use any part of the stage and the first to realize the microphone was cordless all along) And in
that moment she comes to life speaking from her heart Even the tone of her voice sounds
different less guarded more free

HOLLIE
There are three islands of security in this world
Health love and work I lost them all in 2 single
phone call 1 am a widow

Woman From California

The one who took him And though we only lived
there as a family for eighteen months twenty-seven years
ago ’ve always felt it I’m the one He was your

Be us that was not (God forbid) “part of the plan”

A rampant silence has filled the room

HOLLIE

But we were in love

(beat fast)
And I know the rap on me I’m a humorless
liberal Catholic and I never took the time to know
all of you and for that I am sorry And I criticized
somebody’s cooking on my last visit here but as P’ll
tell you in a moment I’m now a struggling cook
myself I know how hard it is please forgive me
and J say that as a humorless liberal Catholic who
is apparently still humorless

ON HOLLIE

She is only starting to warm to the occasion She’s finding her voice now confiding in the
audience

HOLLIE
Let me tell you about life without Mitch

ON FACES
watching

HOLLIE
tried to learn about Mitch’s car It actually ate me
I went to the bank The teller looked at me strangely
and when I got home I looked in the mirror My face
was still green from a facial mask I forgot to take off
I called the Insurance Man of thirty years whose
son Mitch helped get into West Point to tell him Mitch
was gone He didn’t call me back for two days

(beat)

The car The bank The Insurance Man The world
Nobody truly cared Not like us

Hollie pauses almost loses her way then regains her footing

HOLLIE
And then there was daylight
HER POV
as the spotlight crosses her vision
HOLLIE

I knew what the answer was The answer was joy
That’s what Mitch wanted

ON HEATHER
watching stoned
HOLLIE

always wanted to leam to tap-dance So I took
lessons And 1 wanted to cook organically so 1

attempted that And I fixed the toilet All by myself
(irritated screed)

How are we able to put a man on the moon and

toilets are still as bad as when I was a kid the

suction ball that keeps flapping That damn suction ball

Well I learned to fix it

There is genuine laughter and it surprises her

And I wanted to learn to laugh Why wasn’t 1
this funny when he was alive Best J can figure
(beat) ‘
It takes time to be funny It takes time to extract
joy from life 4

SHOT OF SOMEONE

who nods in quiet agreement

HOLLIE
So I enrolled in Comedy School

Big laugh Hollie rolls with it laughs a little herself at the irony

SHOT OF STERN-LOOKING MAN

f

who still isn’t buying it though all around him is laugbter

HOLLIE

I was the oldest one in the class And I was told
to tell one story a true story about real life something
that happened to me So J got up there and talked
a little bit about my husband and the love he left
behind A few days after Mitch died the next-door
neighbor one of Mitch’s good friends Bob saw that
I was going through the gate and he said “I’m so
sorry for your loss” And I knew he needed to feel
that loss and share it And wanted to help him
He put his arms around me cradled me and his embrace
tightened Finally here was someone who truly cared
And who you are in times of crisis is who you really are

(perfect beat)
Then I felt something else

She lets the moment hang as slow knowing spreads through the crowd

HOLLIE
A huge well let’s just say it a boner
Huge laughs -
HOLLIE
That’s what I get for trying to do everything
myself

ON DREW

HOLLIE
But some didh’t let him down Sometimes those thirty
pages letters helped his friends get rich or gave advice
or just made ‘em happy He rooted for all of you And
he loved his family my patient daughter and my busy
son And he was not bitter He was more playful
then maybe some of you knew —

listening to these words which strike home

HOLLIE
But here’s some advice I can give to you —

She gestures around the beautiful ballroom

HOLLIE
Give all these gifts to the living Do it now
Be embarrassing Don’t wait for the perfect
time Mitch is gone and Boner Bob lives on
That’s life

She shakes her head laughs to herself Deep knowing laughs surround her

Big forgiving laughs

HOLLIE
I may need your help I haven’t been single since
J was 18 And that was that was a couple years ago

HOLLIE
One last Mitch story We were walking one night
and asked him — “what should I do if God forbid
something happens and you go before I do How
do you want to be buried” And he looked at me
and smiled and said —
(beat)

“Surprise me”

Appreciative laughter and some applause

HOLLIE
This would have surprised him

She addresses the slide-portrait of Mitch above the podium

HOLLIE
And I’m going to surprise you too T love you

She gives her signa for the music

HOLLIE
This is for you Your favorite song Ona
Saturday night

It’s Henry Mancini’ s “Moon River” instrumental and Hollie begins to tap-dance Slowly with
basic moves Lights reduce to a single spotlight and it is her moment of absolute grace Hollie
reaches a wobbly crescendo to huge applause The strange sad freedom of her movements is
fearless and funny and quite beautiful Finally finally they understand Hollie the woman Mitch
married The sound ofa standing ovation rings over onto”

INT BALLROOM LOBBY - NIGHT

Drew stands alone taking a breather from the event He hears a small commotion and tums to

see Claire arriving dress swishing as she moves quickly He is genuinely surprised and happy to
see her They are alone in the lobby

Claire draws closer She looks great but seems a touch distant Both search each others faces for
clues to where they stand

CLAIRE
Well you know I have this thing for you

For a moment all his pressing business even The Plan is shattered His heart privately races And
then he realizes the “thing” for him is actually a thing for him Claire pulls a brown wooden box
from her unwieldy looking shoulder bag
