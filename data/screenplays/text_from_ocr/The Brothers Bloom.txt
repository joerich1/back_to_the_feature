by

Rian Johnson
EXT DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE

Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
road A car chugs over the horizon

NARRATOR
As far as con man stories go

But if one bears a bookmark in
the confidence man’s tome
twould be that of Penelope
and of the brothers Bloom

then summed the burgh up thusly

STEPHEN
Bloom we’ve hit a one hat town

One theater One car wash One
cafe One park One cat Which
through some mishap had one leg

The cat sits on a roller skate rowing itself down the street
with its one leg

The playground bourgeoisies

He storms off Bloom lingers staring silently at the
children
EXT FOREST

The brothers amble down a wooded path Bloom stops staring
into the trees

Through the dense thicket of foliage the children playing
And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
patch in the leaves

Bloom pushes the leaves aside A girl Golden curls
Summer dress Standing in the distance on a wide lawn

(MORF)

Bloom gazes Stephen places his hand on Blooms back

EXT PARK -— CONTINUOUS

Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he’s been
shoved) and regains his footing and freezes not shielded at
all now from the playing kids and the girl

NARRATOR
Could he simply

STEPHEN (0S)
Talk to her

NARRATOR
Just drop his fears and go Leave
his brother in the woods and join
the children

The girl makes eye contact twisting a daisy chain between
her tiny fingers Bloom’s adam apple convulses

He turns tail and runs back into the woods

NARRATOR (cont’d)

wise shuffling a pack of cards

BLOOM
What’s doing

STEPHEN
What

BLOOM

You shuffle when you’re thinking
something through So whatcha
thinking

STEPHEN
Not a thing

NARRATOR
This wasn’t really true
Cause in the root of Stephens
psyche something now began
A seed of grand epiphany A hook
A tale
EXT WOODS - DAY

STEPHEN
A plan

Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump and
talks Bloom through it

NARRATOR
A fiction made for profit in which
both boys played a part
A simple con in fifteen steps

Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes
each neatly numbered stopping at 1 “Bloom Talks To
Girl”

EXT PARK — DAY

Children and the gold haired Girl playing The wall of
foliage where the forest begins shimmers

NARRATOR
And then as if a curtain had been
pulled back from the sky
Some barrier within the younger
Bloom was broken

Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
lawn confident glowing stopping face to golden face with
the girl

BLOOM
Hi
They talk They run They laugh They play
NARRATOR
So Bloom performed his role in

Stephen’s story to aT

A cave of wonders
BOY
Pffft ha

A will-o-whisp

BLOOM

STEPHEN
-if you can keep up

EXT PARK

BLOOM
-to where the treasures lay

BOY
So where’s this cave

GIRL

INT ATTIC

STEPHEN
Ah-hah The hermit didn’t say
He got this greedy glinting look
the filthy red-eyed leech and
said he’d tell for thirty bucks

Something in Bloom’s face falls

EXT PARK

The girl’s bright trusting face looking at him A moment of
silence Then triumphant an excited boy leaps to his feet

EXCITED BOY
Well that’s just two bucks each

The kids all rejoice and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
Bloom He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
girl’s joyful gaze
NARRATOR
So Sunday came

EXT WOODS

Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
woods led by Bloom

NARRATOR
and straight from church into
the woods Bloom led
INT CAVE
In the dim light of a cave Stephen overturns the coolers of
water and retreats into shadow A flood soaks into the dirt
floor as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
children come into sight
NARRATOR
They stopped Their hearts leapt
There it was

EXT CAVE

The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave

(MORF)

GIRL
Just like the hermit said

Deep in the cave’s dark maw a spark of light

The children gasp collectively The Girl grabs Bloom’s arm
Bloom stares transfixed as any of them

The spark becomes a glowing fluttering point of light which
hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment then

recedes deeper into the gloom

With a cry the children Bloom included dash into the cave

INT CAVE

The light glows just around the next corner the children
run after it slipping in the mud laughing turning the
corner

And the light glows just around the next corner They
scramble they slip and slide they can’t catch the light
but they’re all having the time of their lives

Bloom included Holding the girl’s hand laughing eyes full
of wonder

NARRATOR
For just one moment Bloom forgot
himself and ran too fast
He puts on a burst of speed gets ahead of the crowd
NARRATOR (cont’d)
Hed catch the light and find the
treasure
Turning a corner he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
Stephen flashlight in hand shooing him back as he turns the
next corner

Bloom stops running

NARRATOR (cont’d)
But the moment passed

The other kids and the girl pass him but Bloom stands dead
still a strange expression on his face

The girl turns back towards him still running and holds out
her hand for him to follow

(MORF)

But he doesn’t He stays behind and is soon left alone

EXT PLAYGROUND

NARRATOR
They didn’t catch the will-o-wisp
but didn’t really care

The muddied children walk home laughing while Bloom leans
against a lamppost Stephen appears behind him counting
their money

STEPHEN
It seems to me that in the end the
perfect con is where
each one involved gets just the
thing they wanted

BLOOM
Yeah I guess so
NARRATOR
Our fledgling thieves were

satisfied

EXT FOSTER HOUSE - DAY

A front door opens revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears

NARRATOR
The children’s parents less so

The Foster Parents exchange a glance
QUICK SHOTS -
Stephen is smacked

The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
angry big one

A telephone slams down

On a form the field “Reason for return” is filled with
“Larceny”

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away
The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
sunlight

NARRATOR
A bitter ending Maybe But
there’s sweetness in the mix

Beneath the bed forgotten a piece of paper On it the con
flow-chart Numbered boxes

NARRATOR (cont’d)
The brothers Bloom had found their
calling

One of the boxes number six

NARRATOR (cont’d)
As shown in number six

BOX 6 “Cut O’Henry’s”

NARRATOR (cont’d)
‘Cut’ meant to negotiate ‘percent’
percentage deal

EXT SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY

Through a storefront window - rows of the children’s muddy
Sunday clothes hang each tagged

NARRATOR
‘O’Henry’s’ was the town’s one dry
clean shop

And striding out of the store beneath the ‘O’Henry’s
Cleaners’ sign is Stephen fifty dollars in hand sucking a
Rocket Pop The OWNER leans out of the door looking a
little nervous Stephen throws him back a salute

EXT BACK ALLEY - DAY

Bloom sits against a wall suitcases beside him Boxes of
Rocket Pops and one in each fist Stephen plops down beside
him

STEPHEN
So how’s it feel

(MORF)

Bloom’s eye catches the children and the girl playing in
the distance

NARRATOR
In truth young Bloom won’t know
for twenty years just how he felt

HONK A ‘Child Welfare’ car waiting out on the street The
brothers pick themselves up

NARRATOR (cont’d)
And so we’ll skip ahead now in our
story

Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop

Let ‘em melt

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT
Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves
TITLE CARD BERLIN 25 YEARS LATER

A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
the flaming books

YOUNG MAN
He gets the scarab you get the
money I get the girl so in the
end everyone gets everything he
wants

Three gunshots two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
young man folds to the ground

(MORF)

A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun while
behind him the rest of the library roars in flames

VOICE (0S)

Wha - Charleston what - oh my god
are you oh god he’s dead
Victor’s dead you’ve killed us

We had it he was right it was all
in the bag and now we’re dead why
Why you stupid son of a bitch

The owner of the voice a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
in a derby cap snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
hard

CHARLESTON
Cause the Turk was right After
seeing her after that night on the
airstrip after Cairo everything
changed and he couldn’t see the
play through that one milky eye
but the Turk was right about one
thing that there’s nothing
beautiful about money She’s
beautiful

MCGUIRE
This isn’t happening

CHARLESTON
He’1l never have her now Shes
free And I’1l never see her in
scarlet again her chestnut hair
but it’s worth the money and my job
and his life and the rest of my
life that she’s free

MCGUIRE
Charleston I can’t be here

CHARLESTON
You’re not here Neither of us
are It’s Mowcher’s gun

MCGUIRE
Mowcher is at the bottom of the
Spree with a cowl in his neck

Charleston gets to his feet
CHARLESTON
They won’t find him for a week and

the Albino will chalk it up to
Davey he won’t talk We’re clean

(MORF)

MCGUIRE
Listen to you - four months ago you
were an investment banker Now
youre nothing The Scarab’s lost
The money’s gone It‘1ll rot in the
Peruvian earth It’s gone

Charleston limps to the flaming doorway

He exits

Victor A long beat

squealing

CHARLESTON
The man named Charleston you met
nine months and a thousand years
ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
dead If we see each other again
it’ll be as strangers As for the
money let it rot

leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled

form of

The distant roar of an engine tires

Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN

early 20s

She gives a nearly imperceptible nod

MCGUIRE
Wow

He pats Victor who sits up spitting blood McGuire

to Victor

The Asian

and the woman for a reaction Gets none

MCGUIRE (contd)
Wow is the word you’re both looking
for Wow

woman nods slightly
VICTOR

(un-wowishly)
Youre a genius Stephen

For McGuire is of course Stephen

STEPHEN
We’re a genius Bloom

Just as Victor is indeed Bloom He spits

BLOOM
Tastes like tin foil
STEPHEN
So does real blood Buy you a

drink

looks

(MORF)

Stephen escorts the Asian woman out while Bloom wipes his
lip

EXT HOUSE - PRE-DAWN

A stately house in the middle of nowhere on fire Stephen

holds the door of a car open while Bloom steps from the
flaming house

STEPHEN
“Nine months and a thousand years
ago” That’s Kipling isn’t it

He stole that from Kipling
BLOOM
No
EXT BERLIN - PRE-DAWN

Hazy light over the sprawling city

INT DEUTCH MARK

A low cozy basement level bar A dozen people crowd it all
expectant in a surprise-party type way

A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
raises his drink when Bloom Stephen and the woman enter

THE TURK
Make way make room for the
brothers Bloom

The bar bursts into cheers

INT DEUTCH MARK - LATER

A DWARF dances on the bar Stephen plays cards with the
Turk an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types

THE TURK
Nine months six countries three
faked deaths for one mark You’re
a beautiful antique my friend

They clink glasses

Proust

(MORF)

THE TURK
One thing baffles me The entire
con would have fallen apart if
Charleston had walked away How did
you know he’d pull the trigger

Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards

STEPHEN
Just think of any card Got one

Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades

THE TURK
No

Stephen shrugs

STEPHEN
But if I do it enough eventually
it’1ll work on someone And then
it’ll be the best card trick in the
world

Wink The dwarf slips plummets from the bar Stephen kicks
a chair across the room into which he lands with a crunch

STEPHEN (contd)
Ante up

THE TURK
It’s true you never work with the
same crew twice

STEPHEN
That’s true

THE TURK
Well shit Except for the uh for
her

STEPHEN
Bang Bang

THE TURK
Yeah

Back at the bar - the Asian woman Bang Bang Being hit on
by a weasly ROMANIAN

ROMANIAN
Yeah I’m pretty big into anime

She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes

(MORF)

STEPHEN
Our fifth Beatle She knows the
ins and the outs and so far as I
can tell speaks three words of
English

She taps on the bar

BANG BANG
Campari

BARTENDER
Soda

She says ‘no’ with a look

THE ALBINO
So she’s with you and Bloom till
the end

STEPHEN

Just till the wind changes
Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots

She flicks a champaign flute to make a ‘DING’
bullet bouncing off her

THE TURK
Where is Bloom

at Bang Bang

and mimes the

In the corner of the bar in a private booth with drawn
velvet curtains Bloom sits alone playing solitaire Stuck

with a queen of hearts he can’t play

A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face

through the curtains

ROSE

There you are Hiding
BLOOM

Yeah
ROSE

I’ve been learning Stephen likes
to talk about you

BLOOM
Did he tell you the cave story

ROSE
Is it true

(MORF)

She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the

BLOOM
What else did he tell you

ROSE
I’m not going to tell it as good as
Stephen You two kicked around
till your early teens then stowed
away on a merchant marine freighter
and ended up on the grotty
outskirts of St Petersburg where
you spent five years under the
tutelage of a shadowy old swindler
named the Diamond Dog And he was
your Fagin and Stephen was his
Artful Dodger but it ended
suddenly and badly

BLOOM
Stephen took his eye out with an
antique rapier

ROSE
Why did he do that

BLOOM
And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
on their own to make their fortune
as gentleman thieves Sounds
romantic

ROSE
It does

table her face inches from Bloom’s eyes closed expecting a

kiss

Bloom’s eyes stay open

BLOOM
You want to know how Stephen did
it With Charleston

ROSE
It’s not the first thing on my
mind

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf

(MORF)

BLOOM (0S)

He positioned me in the same spot
where seven years ago
Charleston’s wife stood and told
him she was leaving

The room transforms becomes daylit not on fire seven years
ago a WIFE standing in Bloom’s place

BLOOM (0S) (cont’d)
He chose my outfit to mirror her
suit

Sure enough the colors and shape of Bloom’s suit matches the
Wife’s outfit

BLOOM (0S) (contd)
He even phonetically matched my
final words to hers

WIFE
This is the end Charelston youve
always been a dunce

Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room

BANG

BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
So in the end everyone gets
everything he wants

INT DEUTCH MARK

BLOOM
That’s what he does he writes his
cons the way dead Russians write
novels with thematic arcs and
imbedded symbolism and shit And
he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
hero And that’s why you think you
want to kiss me It’s a con

He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
towards the exit passing Stephen

BLOOM (cont’d)
I need air

STEPHEN
Who doesn’t
(plays a card)
That’s the big 2

EXT BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING

Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level A THOUSAND
YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square

Bloom sits wearily on the curb bowler hat in hand shirt
bright red with fake blood face long as hell

Putting the broom aside a moment the old man walks painfully
across the street to Bloom Standing nearly toe to toe with
him the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
face

He then smears his hand over his mug pulling the smile off
his face and rubbing it on Bloom’s mouth When he takes his
hand away Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
smile The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom
As soon as the old man is away Bloom drops the smile
Stephen paces out into the street
STEPHEN
We missed the sunrise That

would’ve been nice

They walk across the street to the Tiergarten

EXT TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING

Berlin’s Central Park and zoo dead and brown The brothers
stroll through the woods Stephen a few steps ahead Bloom
trailing behind lost in thought

Camel heads poke over a wall with ‘Kamelhaus’ painted on it
Stephen throws open the wall’s gate

STEPHEN
Is this a bathroom No this is
camels
(to camels)
Back to the swamps boys
The camels are unimpressed Bloom slouches into a bench

Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom who nods Stephen
cuts the deck shows him a card Bloom shakes his head no

STEPHEN (contd)
At least you’re honest

Bloom stares into space

(MORF)

STEPHEN (cont’d)
Alright let’s do this Let’s just
get it done So first you say ‘I’m
quitting Stephen I’m out’ Then
I say

BLOOM
‘Do we have to go through this
again’

STEPHEN
Then you make a show of putting on
your jacket and say ‘no I mean it
this time Stephen this time I’m
really out’

BLOOM
Then you say ‘let’s have a drink
and in the morning Bloom you’1l
have come to your senses’

Stephen pulls a flask unscrews it

STEPHEN
(re Bloom’s bright red
blood stain)
That’s a major design flaw in fake
blood by the way

BLOOM
‘and well be moving on’

STEPHEN
Real blood turns brown after a half
hour

BLOOM
Listen to me Stephen

STEPHEN
This scotch costs more than your
suit

BLOOM
Listen to me

STEPHEN
And the flask stopped a bullet from
a black powder rifle at Appomattox

BLOOM
Listen

(MORF)

Bloom bats the flask away A camel catches it tips its
camel neck back and gulps it down

STEPHEN
That’s my new favorite camel

BLOOM
I hate you I hate this life I
hate it I hate that you won’t
fucking listen to me for one
goddamn second Just listen

Stephen listens

BLOOM (cont’d)
I can’t wake up next to another
stranger who thinks they know me
or even wants to know me cause I
don’t know - who - I’m thirty five
years old and I I’m useless I’m
crippled I don’t I’ve only ever
lived life through these roles that
aren’t me that are written for me
by you

STEPHEN
Tell me what you want

BLOOM
Why So you can write me a role in
a story where I get it You’re not
listening to me I want a real
thing I wanna do things how I
don’t know are gonna work out a
I want a

STEPHEN
(sotto)
You want an unwritten life

BLOOM
I want an unwritten life
(realizes Stephen just
wrote that line for him)
Aauuugghh god

The camel belches Bloom makes a show of putting on his
jacket

BLOOM (cont’d)
I’m going away Somewhere you or
even Bang Bang won’t be able to
track me down so don’t try No
more stories

(MORF)

Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler and storms off He gets
about ten feet then hesitates

BLOOM (cont’d)
I love you Bye

Then goes

The camel nudges Stephen’s jacket looking for more scotch
Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head

STEPHEN
Sorry bud I’m dry

Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
mist lost in thought

His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards
FADE OUT

window A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom

(MORF)

Bloom stirs passed out in a hammock Unkept beard a few
extra pounds Crushed cigar hanging on his lip

The Grandmother waddles in cleaning up bottles and berating
Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian

STEPHEN
She’s right you know

BLOOM
Why are you here Stephen

STEPHEN
Put on your face let’s eat

EXT LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON

A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
ludicrous mansion Our trio watch it from the road

BLOOM
Sorry where are we

STEPHEN
The biggest private residence on
the Eastern seaboard home of our
final mark Daddy was an oil
tycoon a Hearst type built a
Xanadu to match then died hunting
quail Mom followed into the
hereafter two years ago after ten
years fighting an illness that I
can’t pronounce leaving our sucker
all alone in this ludicrous estate
with an insane amount of very
liquid assets

BLOOM
How much

Bang Bang writes a number in the dirt with a stick Just
when we think she’s done she adds several more zeros

BLOOM (cont’d)
Jesus

(MORF)

STEPHEN
Look out

They duck as a cherry red Lamborghini roars past them down
the private road

BLOOM
What the hell was that

EXT MANSION DRIVEWAY - DAY

Our three scamper up behind a clump of trees just into to see
the Lamborghini roar up the drive and crunch painfully into a
fortified wall kicking up a cloud of dust and smoke

Thumping bass from the audio system turns off and from the
dust cloud emerges PENELOPE early 30s beautiful but ina
non-Lamborghini way

Bloom watches her through the trees none too happy

EXT THICKET - LATER

Bloom walks at a brisk pace away from the mansion with
Stephen and Bang Bang in tow

BLOOM
(to Bang Bang)
Get the car

STEPHEN

BLOOM
What am I doing here Stephen I
have one rule and you’ve never
even tested it

STEPHEN
Stick with me

BLOOM
No women One rule You know we
don’t do women I don’t and it’s
not a morality thing or- a thing-
it’s whatever it is it doesn’t
matter what it is that’s just our
rule So what are we

Bang Bang pulls up in their car an old school Cadillac

(MORF)

BLOOM (contd)
Is this a ‘78 Caddy Hm
Controversial choice So no is
what I’m saying I’m quits anyway
I‘ll be in Italy Drinking

The front door of the mansion slams and they watch Penelope
drag a harp around into the back yard

STEPHEN
Penelope Stamp Thirty three
Lived at home her whole life

Bloom’s eyes never leave Penelope

BLOOM
An eccentric shut-in rich bitch
You’re not helping your case

Bang Bang silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass he
watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump

STEPHEN
She’s bored a seed in the snow
We’re going to put her through a
grand adventure bring her to life

In the background a tow truck arrives with a brand new
Lamborghini and leaves towing the old one

BLOOM
So this is the big plan Lure me
back into things with some
beautiful intriguing elusive girl
stir up old memories with the
prospect of redemption and rebirth
Seriously Stephen Amateur night

Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp
BLOOM (cont’d)
I’m not saying yes But what’s the

con

Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump with
a flowchart on it Numbered boxes

Bloom doesn’t take his spyglass off Penelope

(MORF)

STEPHEN
It’s actually pretty simple We’re
brothers antique dealers perusing
the Americas for antiquities en
route to someplace exciting via
luxury steamer say Greece You
tie into her and work your magic

Penelope plays on

INT HOTEL BAR - NIGHT

Very late Bloom and Stephen in armchairs collars loosened
drinks drunk Bang Bang’s Chuck Taylors stick up over the
back of a chair

Bloom holds the con flowchart

STEPHEN
and so that’s how it ends in
Mexico a burst of violence then a
moment of truth on the beach What
do you think

Bloom idly looks over the chart

BLOOM
Youve got something up your
sleeve This is about me right
Somehow

STEPHEN
This might not be something you
know but they’ve all been about
you Maybe that’s why they’ve none
of them been perfect I’ve never
been able to give you what you
really want

BLOOM
I want outta all this So by
definition this is not going to
give me what I want

Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve
BLOOM (cont’d)
This will be the last one Youll

let me go

Bang Bang’s inert sneakers come to life and she’s on her
feet silently going to Stephen’s side

(MORF)

STEPHEN
I will never approach you to do
another con again
(to Bang Bang)
Let’s make it a red Schwinn

Bloom stares at 1 on the flowchart - “BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE”

EXT HILLTOP - MORNING

A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn an ill fitting
Styrofoam helmet on his head

Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below

Bang Bang sets up a lawn umbrella a chair for herself and a
cooler with Coronas

BLOOM
There are less painful ways to cut
into a mark

STEPHEN
Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk
Score to beat is 79 Keep your
head in the game the Japanese
judge is tough

BLOOM
This is a banana seat man

He directs this to Bang Bang who blinks with innocent
incomprehension and opens two Coronas

BLOOM (cont’d)
Don’t give me that blank look you
know what a goddamn banana seat is

Stephen spots something and blows a whistle With a grunt
Bloom launches the Schwinn forward

Gaining speed bumping over weeds and gopher holes down the
steep steep hill

At the bottom of the hill a two lane highway Cruising down
the highway a cherry red Lamborghini

Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into

CUT TO

EXT HIGHWAY SKY - DAY

Silent and blue Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
through the air arcing over the Italian luxury car’s hood
and past a horrified Penelope face frozen mid scream behind
the wheel

BLOOM (VO)
There’s actually a knack to this
You want to avoid dying or breaking
anything that won’t grow back but
you don’t want to roll out of it
and come up roses If you’re
trying to fast track into a mark’s
sympathies there’s nothing quite
as efficient as having your first
conversation be from a hospital bed
they put you in I usually like to
try for a dislocated shoulder

Several things happen at once

Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first hard The bent bike
follows suit

Up on the hill Stephen and Bang Bang raise score cards 89
and 56

The Lamborghini screeches to a stop

Everything is still

Then the car jolts forward Then stops Then again jolts
and stops Rolls forward a few feet lazily drifting then
jolts and stops

Bloom painfully stands as confused by the car’s behavior as
us

Stephen and Bang Bang lower their cards equally confused
One last long beat of silence then the car jolts forward
veers drunkenly to the left tips into a ditch and chunks to
a stop The horn blares

Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance

Stephen stares blankly Bang Bang raises a new score card -
78
INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Penelope sleeps bruised and battered Bloom sits bedside

uncomfortably arm in a wimpy sling She stirs
forward

Bloom leans

Slurred with sleep and drugs she painfully barely breathes

PENELOPE
Are you alright

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT
Bloom consults with Stephen and Bang Bang both in
STEPHEN
Bang Bang had it - I’m telling him
I know thank you - in her report
I missed it This is actually kind

of great I’1l tell you why

Bang Bang lights a cigarette

BLOOM
You missed it
STEPHEN
Dostoevsky was an epileptic
BLOOM
I know
STEPHEN

His seizures were preceded by an
enlightened euphoria a sort of
opening of his spiritual eye I
think the fact that she saw your
face the instant before a seizure
is a pretty goddamn good foot to
start things out on right

scrubs

Bloom stares blankly Bang Bang burps into her stethoscope

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Bloom slumps in a chair watching Penelope sleep

BLOOM (VO)

The next step is to figure out a
way to insinuate yourself into
their personal life

(MORF)

Bloom drifts off then wakes with a start
It is MORNING Penelope is shaking him

PENELOPE
I think they took my car Could
you drive me home

BLOOM
Uh Yeah

She walks away the back of her gown wide open then turns

PENELOPE
I’m Penelope Stamp

BLOOM
Bloom

INT CADILLAC - MORNING
Bloom drives Penelope gazes stiffly out the window

BLOOM (VO)
Engagement Find a connection with
your mark through conversation

BLOOM (cont’d)
I’m sorry about your Lamborghini

PENELOPE
S’ ok

Silence He notices her playing with the side mirror knob
angling it to stare at him while looking out the window

BLOOM
Nice area
(beat)
Jersey

More silence

PENELOPE
This car is like riding in a huge
marshmallow

And still more silence

BLOOM (VO)
Having now deftly set your hook in
the mark’s psyche this would be
the perfect time to tug the line

EXT LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING

They pull up in the car A tow truck is dropping off a new
Lamborghini

BLOOM (VO)
Get invited in for coffee and tell
them the full tale

Bloom looks about to launch into something when Penelope
drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
dashboard

PENELOPE
For the bike and the whole thing
This was a big shit sandwich Ok
Bye

The car door slams and she’s gone Bloom sits a moment

BLOOM (VO)
However there are advantages to
playing it cool Letting it lie
for a day or two then casually re-
establish contact

Bloom starts driving off and adjusts the passenger side
mirror so it points back to the road As he does he sees
Penelope in it sprinting after his car

He stops A moment later she appears at his window heaving

PENELOPE
I realized I should have
invited you in for coffee
right

INT PENELOPE’S KITCHEN - DAY

Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen
neither touching their coffee Bloom talks

This is how Penelope listens she starts with her eyes on
Bloom then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts
then recognizes she’s doing it and makes eye contact again
and gives an overbaked “oh yes go on” smilenod then does it
all again Three or four times

BLOOM
-didn’t really have anyone except
each other growing up and our
father was in the antique business
he had a shop in Charleston

(MORE )

(MORF)

BLOOM (contd)
So we stuck together my brother
Stephen and me we and just took
over the shop when dad died Then
we realized one day we saw the
dealers who were finding and
selling us the antiques coming from
exotic countries all over the
world and there was a almost a
scent they had when they’d come in
the dusty shop we worked nine to
five in since we were nineteen the
air would like before a rain the
ions would line up and you could
just smell midnight trains to Paris
and steamer ships and Calcutta
bazaars and we made the decision
we just did it that we want to
have that sort of life So we did
and weve been travelling and
treasure hunting the world ever
since and could you I’m sorry
stop doing - that you’re I’m ok
Alright look

PENELOPE
I’m really bad at talking to
people

BLOOM
I told you that’s alright
You want me to go

PENELOPE
No I want to talk to you Fuck

She storms out

INT PARLOR

Victorian expensive Penelope leans against the window
looking out Sulking Bloom enters

BLOOM
So what kind of stuff do you do

PENELOPE
Nothing Maybe you should go

BLOOM
Alright I’m just gonna finish my
coffee first

(MORF)

Very slowly he sips it Each sip becomes a noisier and
noisier slurp

PENELOPE
I collect hobbies I see someone
doing something I like and I get
books and learn how to do it

BLOOM
Hm Anything interesting

PENELOPE
Not really

HOBBY MONTAGE

In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting
seriousness and skill for Bloom

Playing the piano The classical guitar The fiddle The
banjo

Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle
Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard

Juggling various items Riding a unicycle Juggling while
riding a unicycle

Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed
Karate chopping through too much wood

Breakdancing

Playing the accordion

Rapping to a drum machine

Creating a perfect origami dragon

END HOBBY MONTAGE

On Bloom’s shell-shock face

BLOOM
Is that it

PENELOPE
No I know a lot of stuff

BLOOM

You just learned this stuff here
by yourself

(MORF)

PENELOPE
Kinda sad

BLOOM
No So you just thought ‘so I
want to learn this and this’ and
you just did it How do you plan
to use all these skills

PENELOPE
I dunno I’m not a planner I
just do stuff Here look at this
watermelon It’s a camera You
can make a pinhole camera out of
anything hollowish and dark

BLOOM
It’s gotta warp the image though
right

PENELOPE
No yeah it does That’s what -
the Taj Majal taken by a fat
tourist with diarrhea and a point-
and-shoot camera can be the
flattest dullest “here’s us at
the Taj Majal” “Oh lovely lets go
stick our thumbs up our asses”
picture But you can look at the
most menial everyday thing and
depending on how your pinhole
camera eats the light it’s warped
and peculiar and imperfect It’s
not reproduction it’s
storytelling

BLOOM
It’s a lie that tells the truth

PENELOPE
I dunno about truth A photograph
is a secret about a secret The
more it tells you the less you
know

BLOOM
What’s changed between now and
twenty minutes ago Cause this is
kinda like a conversation

PENELOPE
Huh Well shit

EXT BACKYARD - DAY

Bloom and Penelope walk and talk finally rounding the house
and ending up at the driveway

BLOOM
Well I should uh it’s late So
I meet a lot of people in my job I
have to professionally act
interested in It’s a good feeling
to be genuinely interested in

someone
PENELOPE
Are you leaving
BLOOM
Yeah
PENELOPE

Are you coming back

BLOOM
Well next time I’m in town We’re
taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
off the docks to the continent for
a few months

During this Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
of Penelope’s back The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
small slit of exposed skin

Penelope’s expression does not change but a noticeable blush
crosses her still face

When Bloom removes his hand the blush falls
BLOOM (cont’d)
Paris and Greece I think I’ve
gotta get a hat Thanks for the
pinhole camera demonstration And
for the good conversation Goodbye
Penelope

PENELOPE
Goodbye Bloom

He drives off She stands in the doorway watching him go

EXT THE DOCKS - DAY

A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready Bloom watches the
access road Stephen makes notes Bang Bang whittles

(MORF)

BLOOM
She isn’t coming man I need
another day with her

STEPHEN
You’1l have two weeks on the boat

BLOOM
I need another day to get her on
the boat she isn’t hooked I’ve
had one session and we mostly
talked watermelons and the optics
of lensless photography

STEPHEN
It isn’t the talking that hooked
her

Bloom turns from the road

BLOOM
I think you’re wrong

A screech of distant tires and a crash Bloom doesn’t look
BLOOM (CONT’D) (cont’d)
Though every time I say that you
end up being comically right
That’s her isn’t it Yeah

Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
fit in her Lamborghini which is bent around a pylon

Bloom meets her

PENELOPE
Hey

BLOOM
Hi What are you doing here

She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band

PENELOPE
You left this money in my kitchen

He doesn’t take it

BLOOM
Yeah I didn’t want it but thanks

(MORF)

PENELOPE
Oh
(beat)
Hey where’s this boat going

EXT THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

The good ship Fidele breaks the waves Greece-ward

EXT DECK - DAY
Bloom and Penelope stroll the deck

BLOOM
Why did you decide to come

PENELOPE
Well I’d never been to Greece Or
Europe Or outside New Jersey

BLOOM
It just seems like a big leap
From where you were at yesterday to
being a world traveler

PENELOPE
It looked like fun I wanted to do
it

BLOOM

A new hobby

Up ahead Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape
gazing out to sea He quickly turns Penelope away

BLOOM (cont’d)
Here this way
EXT SHUFFLEBOARD DECK - DAY

Bang Bang and Stephen play shuffleboard Bloom leads
Penelope to them

BLOOM
Penelope this is my brother
Stephen

STEPHEN

Pleased to make your acquaintance
Bloom’s told me about you you’re
the epileptic photographer

(MORF)

PENELOPE
Sort of

STEPHEN
This is my personal secretary and
masseuse Mrs Yuengling

A nearly imperceptible glare from Bang Bang

PENELOPE
Yuengling like the beer

STEPHEN
Heh No So what are your plans
in Greece

PENELOPE
I don’t plan

STEPHEN
Good for you

Bang Bang hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot then
gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow

INT STATE ROOM - NIGHT
The brothers dress for dinner

BLOOM
You named Bang Bang ‘Yuengling’

STEPHEN
I was writing in a bar And
Penelope doesn’t drink how does
she know a Philly beer

BLOOM
She knows a lot of stuff
(beat)
Was that who I thought it was on
the East deck this morning

STEPHEN
Yes it was Did he spot you

An ominous glance

BLOOM
Not yet

EXT DECK - NIGHT

Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck Bloom
and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne Penelope in an
elegant but understated dress shuffles a pack of cards

BLOOM
You look very nice

She laughs as if at a joke she doesn’t think is funny

BLOOM (cont’d)
What was your childhood like

PENELOPE
I make cameras out of watermelons

BLOOM
Lonely

PENELOPE
Lucky guess

Penelope’s hands move faster She knows how to shuffle
cards

PENELOPE (contd)

When I turned six I started getting
allergies hayfever rashes really
bad So my mom took me into the
doctor and he did that test where
they use needles to prick a grid on
your back with all the different
toxins to see which ones you’re
allergic to The next day I came
in the doctor lifted up my shirt
and my back looked like a patch of
oily moldy blackish green double-
puff marshmallows I was allergic
to everything So they sealed the
house with plastic and a special
ventilation system and I spent my
entire childhood and adolescence
indoors Mostly alone Lonely

She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
the table

BLOOM
Wow

PENELOPE

(MORF)

It wasn’t til I was nineteen they
discovered what I was actually
allergic to was the aluminum alloy
the hypodermic needle was made out
of Then I was going to leave but
my mom got sick So I stayed And
she stayed sick a long time

BLOOM
Do you feel cheated

Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens

PENELOPE
The trick to not feeling cheated is
to learn how to cheat Sol
decided this wasn’t a story about a
miserable girl trapped in a house
that smelled like medical supplies
wasting her life on a dying person
she sometimes hated It was about
a girl who could find infinite
beauty in anything any little
thing And do anything she decided
to do And love the person she was
trapped with So I told myself
that story until it became true
Now did doing that let me escape a
wasted life or did it just blind
me so I wouldn’t want to escape it
I don’t know But either way I
was the one telling my own story
So I don’t feel cheated

She finishes the trick
A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads At the
far end of the deck alone at a table the large man in the
fur collared cape who for reasons unlikely to become clear
at the moment will be called THE CURATOR
THE CURATOR

And a magician is just an actor

playing the part of a magician My

compliments
Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
and away

EXT BOW - NIGHT

They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship

(MORF)

PENELOPE
Who is that man You avoided him
earlier on the deck

BLOOM
I don’t know but he’s carrying a
knife up his sleeve and wearing a
cape Do me a favor and steer
clear of him

A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen

BLOOM (CONT’D) (contd)
I don’t suppose in all your hobby
acquiring you ever learned how to
dance

PENELOPE
I went through a phase when I was
mildly obsessed with the Bolero

BLOOM
Give me a minute

He leaves her alone Clouds obscure the moon shadows
deepen She shivers

A match strikes She jumps

The moon re-emerges and she is no longer alone on the deck
The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe shakes out the match

THE CURATOR

It’s been such a time since I’ve
encountered the Brothers Bloom

(MORF)

PENELOPE
You’re in antiques

THE CURATOR
(Cheshire grin)
Antiques I wonder my dear if
you know the true nature of the men
you travel with

The band strikes up a Bolero The Curator flicks his wrist
and a long thin blade falls into his hand

THE CURATOR (contd)
A little fear might suit you I
think

He raises the blade it is in fact a fine mustache brush
which he delicately employs

THE CURATOR (contd)
Bon soir ma cherie

With that the Curator backs into the shadows and is gone
Moments later Bloom trots up to her oblivious

BLOOM

It isn’t a Spanish band but

they’1ll do their best
He hands her a single blood red rose She puts it in her
teeth and they dance If there is a tinge of tension in the
air the Bolero suits it
The moon ducks behind a cloud once more and they dance on in
the dark
INT STATE ROOM - MORNING

Bloom wakes with a start Morning light pours in through his
porthole He opens it looks out to sea

His dinner jacket draped over a chair The rose in its
lapel He fishes it out Runs his fingers over the teeth
marks on the stem

Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket and
pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band
EXT DECK - MORNING

Bang Bang and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck a
beer can pinhole camera between them

place at the table suitcase beside her smoking a cigarette

BLOOM (0S) (cont’d)

when she gets bored she’1ll vanish
with the same lack of noise

Like feeding a strange animal Bloom pours her coffee She
drinks it without looking at him
EXT BREAKFAST DECK

PENELOPE
I like her

BLOOM
Good

They smile when they see Stephen and Bang Bang at a table

Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
them Bloom glares at the Curator but speaks to Stephen

BLOOM (cont’d)
What’s he doing here

in fact the two most highly
respected art smugglers in the
western world

STEPHEN

EXT UPPER DECK -— CONTINUOUS

Bang Bang sits smoking her whittled pipe watching Bloom
alone on the deck Stephen passes her and she stops him
with a look

STEPHEN
Shut up I know what I’m doing

She hands him a thin piece of paper He looks it over

STEPHEN (contd)
This came through just now

The paper is a telegram with the Fidele’s imprint received
from St Petersburg Stephen reads it

STEPHEN (contd)
“My dear Stephen STOP Word on the
wire is the Bros B are bound for
Prague STOP Am heading there myself

Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
band into Penelope’s luggage

BLOOM
No

Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
before giving up

Stephen and Bang Bang poke their heads in leaving The

STEPHEN
We’ll see you back at the hotel
(glances at the Curator)
Soon

They go leaving Bloom and Penelope who squints at an
unframed oil on canvas of a lonely stone well in a primeval
forest clearing It sits at the foot of an unmade bed

THE CURATOR
From a private collection on the
island of Ikaria That one

BLOOM
Who painted it

THE CURATOR
I don’t know

(MORF)

He closes
painting

PENELOPE
Why is it the last thing you see
every night and the first thing
you see every morning

THE CURATOR
That’s a story You have a minute

the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the

Setting the stage

THE CURATOR (contd)
My daughter travelled with me when
she was very young and I’d show
her the places and the art all the
most joyous and terrifying things
in the world

Memories of his daughter’s hand in his flashing against the

sun

He motions to the painting and we move into it

THE CURATOR (CONT’D) (contd)

I wanted that the world was alive
in the most fantastic way for her
To built her a pair of wings Make
these things real But maybe more
than any other objet d’art she
loved to hear she’d ask to hear the
story of the stone golem From a
painting in a small private
collection on the island of Ikaria

As he tells

the story the scenes are shown in the painting just as still

images which we move across like a picture book

THE CURATOR (CONT’D) (contd)

Well Rachel like most monsters the
Golem was once a human A boy
about your age And one day the
boy was walking home and he
quarrelled he fought with a good
friend of his They got very angry
and his friend pushed him a certain
way and the boy fell and struck his
head and died The boy’s friend
was very sad but also very
frightened So instead of telling
the boy’s parents he did something
awful He pulled the body into a
quarry a pit of broken rocks and
hid the boy beneath a pile of large
stones Well

(MORE )

(MORF)

THE CURATOR (CONT’D) (contd)
Years went by and the boy’s friend
became a young man and one day
while drinking in town (which in
his guilt he did quite a lot of) he
heard that a well was being built
near the forest with the stones
from the quarry He ran to the
quarry to find it nearly empty
no stones no body He ran to the
well where the masons were
finishing their work ‘Did they
find anything strange in the
quarry’ he asked expecting maybe
hoping they’d arrest him for the
awful crime on the spot But no
they said motioning to the well
Nothing strange Just stones
They left him alone there at the
well and he stood looking into it
as the sun fell behind the
mountains and twilight set the
world in a deep still silence

The last image we land on is the well alone in the clearing

Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
that follows

Then with a piercing ROAR a living monster of stone lunges
out of the well animated and terrifying grabs the friend by
the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
pulls him back down into the depths of the well

Silence again We pull out of the painting back to the
Curator sitting very still

THE CURATOR (contd)
My daughter died nineteen years ago
today She was six She went out
to play one afternoon and vanished
The next morning we found her ina
stone well on a neighboring
property I climbed down to her
but slipped and broke my leg and
while we waited for the rescue team
to pull us out she died in my arms
If you’ve had a child my whole
everything just focused down to one
thing to hold her and make her
feel safe But no matter what I
said to her I couldn’t stop her
shaking crying Her last moments
on this earth were filled with
terror Of a stone golem

(MORF)

He stands opens the blinds pours another drink

THE CURATOR (contd)
It was the first painting I

‘acquired’ I keep it maybe hoping
some night the golem will come for
me

INT APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER
Bloom trots out ahead of Penelope

THE CURATOR
Mademoiselle

Bloom keeps going anxious to leave but Penelope lingers on
the staircase The Curator comes out

THE CURATOR (contd)
It is you I do business with yes

PENELOPE
Right Oh right

She gives him the envelope with the certified check He
shakes her hand then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child’s

He lets go and smiles apologetically

Well then please don’t call Stephen
down Look at you you’re
terrified C’mon now look Take
a look I’m an old man with no
depth perception You don’t have
to be scared of me

The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter making sparks

DIAMOND DOG (contd)
It’s been a funny thing watching
you boys take what I taught you and
eclipse me I’m so proud to be a
footnote in the lives of the
Brothers Bloom And you hate me
The curse of all bad fathers - that
my presence on this earth after I
die will not live on the lips of
admiring men but will sink into
the murky backwaters of my
children’s psyches

(MORF)

BLOOM
Is this profundity Cause you can
skip it

DIAMOND DOG
Ha Ha ha Piss and vinegar

The Dog scoots next to Bloom

DIAMOND DOG (contd)
When I first took you boys in
showed you the ropes haunting St
Pete’s piss and vinegar I still
crave that youthful joy Even
today

The Dog’s hand touches Bloom’s leg There is something
horrible about this

Beneath the bar Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife

BLOOM
Don’t touch me

DIAMOND DOG
You probably won’t believe I loved
you boys very much

BLOOM
You’re going to take your hand away
or I’m going to break your arm
there’s nothing between

He does but Bloom’s fingers don’t loosen on the pencil

DIAMOND DOG
But love you know We know folks
like us you can always blink and
realize that it’s a fiction and
like Peter walking on water or
Wiley Coyote running off a cliff
if you look down in doubt you’1l
fall That’s the price of our
lives the wax in our wings One
day Stephen’s going to fall It
may be glorious but he’s going to
fall hard and he won’t be there to
tell you what to do and protect
you When he’s gone remember me

The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom his breath hot on
his face and his hand comes to rest fully on Blooms leg

Bloom’s hand with the pencil quivers about to strike-

When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand

bleeding hand Bloom stands numb and puts the pencil in his
pocket

Poking around the room Bloom opens a closet The Curator
stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas

something about water cranes but
essentially it means “When you’re

Bang Bang lies on the floor with Penelope showing her how to
build a tiny remotely detonated bomb She slices a tiny bit

off a brick of dynamite sets it in a petri dish with a

detonator and puts the whole thing in a handbag

Penelope appreciates her

Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan

STEPHEN
There’s a smoke detector in these
empty rooms in the east tower So
we plant and set off a tiny -

TINY tiny tiny charge

Bang Bang clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen

With a

on fire and the smoke rises to the ceiling

He folds up the plans she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an

open handbag on the table

PENELOPE (contd)
Is this Yeungling’s backpack

She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
the front zipper compartment and sets the tiny petri-dish

bomb beside the handbag

PENELOPE
You know what I feel

BLOOM
Horny

PENELOPE

Scared All my big talk But this

The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in

Bang Bang finds a way to casually smell Bloom’s fingers

Because going in alone is a very
important thing to do She’s

the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance

Holy shit He is going to steal that apple

Deftly he passes lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
turns away Bloom has done it His pale face tightens

And turns

And sees a five year old boy Giving him a stare of infinite
judgement

Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER

EXT TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT

BLOOM
No we were going to blow you off
tomorrow using the cackle bladder
it’s a term we have actors
playing the Argentina guy’s men
when we showed up the deal would go
bad they would open fire on us
Stephen and I would pretend to be
shot using blood packets squibs
That’s - cackle bladder in the old
days they put fake blood in chicken
bladders so So you’d escape
with Yeungling whose name isn’t
Yeungling by the way we don’t know
what it is but she’d send you off
with a little travelling money and
that would be that

PENELOPE
Wow

BLOOM
But that’s not how this one’s going

piece of you

Stephen stands

STEPHEN
I’m sorry you fell in love with
her But she’s a mark And all of
this all of it is a con Every
moment you shared with her you
were just playing the part of a man
falling in love That’s what
youre afraid of right That you
don’t know the difference Or
maybe that there is no difference
That that’s what love is

PENELOPE
We’re leaving

STEPHEN
(to Bloom)

No You’re too scared to leave
Youre scared to ride off into the
sunset if you were ready for that
you wouldn’t be here The money is
in my bedroom Right behind me
But in my story you don’t get the
money or the sunset or the girl

A long beat The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen

PENELOPE
Bloom Let’s just go Please

Bloom LUNGES cracking Stephen in the jaw

Stephen goes down Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
Bloom’s leg and brings him down

Then they are fighting Penelope watches horrified

A frightening brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
apart thirty years worth of a fight

(MORF)

Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope’s feet

Upsetting a small table Bang Bang’s pistol lying on the
holey paper target falls and strikes the ground

And goes off with a deafening rapport
Blood spreads just beneath Stephen’s collarbone
Penelope screams

Stephen stays standing for a moment shocked A dribble of
blood out of the corner of his mouth He half grins

STEPHEN
Tastes like tin foil

And sinks to the ground

Bloom’s eyes glaze He crawls to his wounded brother Takes
him in his arms

BLOOM
Stephen

Penelope watches the brothers holding each other Tears in
her eyes but she backs away a step very conscious of not
being a part of this moment

Bloom looks up at her almost taking a moment to recognize
her

PENELOPE
Bloom

He doesn’t move from his brother

PENELOPE (contd)
I’m sorry

She leaves

For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other’s arms
in the middle of the broken room

walking off into the distance down the beach

STEPHEN

Hey

I think that was the most honest
conversation we’ve ever had

(more nothing)
You actually connected on a few of
those punches

BLOOM
Did you expect me to do it To
come here tonight end it the way
you wrote it Or were you really
disappointed I didn’t run off with
her

STEPHEN
I was disappointed But I wasn’t
surprised

Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw Stephen falls to the
sand

BLOOM
I let you do your monologue but
you wanna know why I did it I did
it so she’d never want to see me
again To get her away from all
this for good

Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach in the
opposite direction of Penelope leaving Stephen bleeding in
the sand alone in the dark uncertain night

for an instant

She gives Penelope a quick little “call me” gesture picks up
her case and walks off

A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away and she gets
in

A narrow alley between tall apartments Bloom parks pulls
his gun and checks it

(MORF)

BLOOM
If there are shots you run to the
car and drive with or without me

INT APARTMENT ENTRYWAY —- DAY

A badly lit apartment hallway Bloom enters his eyes wide
Penelope behind him Approaches a staircase

His breathing becomes hard His face contorts He needs
air He dashes out-
EXT APARTMENT COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

-gasping for breath kneeling in the filthy courtyard
surrounded by bad memories Penelope goes to him

PENELOPE
What’s in there Tell me who this
guy is

Blooms breathing steadies

BLOOM
He’s just an old man

He looks up at the apartment windows strengthened

INT DIAMOND DOG’S APARTMENT - DAY

Blood red walls

Dark neglected and to all appearances empty Bloom enters
Penelope behind him They creep down the darkened corridor
Bloom with his gun outstretched He breathes through his
nose chokes

BLOOM
Dog I came back

He kicks open a door revealing a large living space Empty
He lowers his gun switches on the light
Penelope enters Sniffs the air

PENELOPE
Moth balls

Bloom almost laughs

(MORF)

BLOOM
Is that what that smell is

BAM A closet door smacks open revealing the business end
of a double barrel shotgun

Bloom spins gun drawn Penelope screams
Then a moment of stillness The shotgun barrel quivers

It’s held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dogs
Mercedes in Prague Malnourished and scared

Penelope approaches him slowly
PENELOPE
(in Russian)

It’s okay Honey it’s alright

The shotgun sinks to the ground Penelope strokes his hair
back from his face

Bloom lowers the gun trembling

BLOOM
Ask him if anyone else is here
She does
BOY
Nyet
BLOOM

Ask him where the Diamond Dog is

PENELOPE
Diamond Dog
(in Russian)
Where is the Diamond Dog

BOY
(in English)
The Dog of Diamonds is gone

Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room As he
does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian and
gets a quick answer

BLOOM
Get the car started

PENELOPE
What about him

(MORF)

BLOOM
It’s alright

She believes him and goes Bloom kneels in front of the
boy

BLOOM (cont’d)
You don’t need to be afraid of him
anymore Or angry at him Or ever
come back here again He doesn’t
concern you anymore Understand
It’s gonna be ok

The boy nods Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
the green rubber band The boy snatches it and runs off

EXT ST PETERSBURG STREET - DAY

Bloom trots out of the apartment building and sees two
things Penelope working the VW’s starter and a black
Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her

He sprints towards her screaming

BLOOM
Get out Get out of the car

She sees the approaching Merc too late and ducks down

A hand hurls something from the darkened window It smashes
through the Bug’s passenger side window showering Penelope
with glass

The Mercedes roars off down the street
Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open

Penelope lies covered in safety glass holding a Russian
nesting doll

INT BUG - LATER

The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
seat Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll and
Penelope holds a note

PENELOPE
It’s a ransom note It says they
have Stephen it says they want the
money wired to a specific account
they give a bank to do it at anda
manager to ask for

(MORE )

(MORF)

PENELOPE (contd)
Then an address to come to at two
pem In two hours

BLOOM
I’‘1l wire the money from my
account and we’ll go get Stephen

PENELOPE
It’s a lot

BLOOM
How much

PENELOPE
I’1l do it I want to I’ve got
plenty-

BLOOM
How much are they asking for

PENELOPE
One point seven five million

A cold pit opens in Bloom’s stomach

He punches

BLOOM
Oh Oh oh No no NO

the dashboard

BLOOM (cont’d)
No I’11 kill him I’11 kill him if
that’s what this is if that’s all
that this is no NO NO

PENELOPE
What are you talking about

BLOOM
There’s another possibility that I
should of I’m a fucking idiot
This might all be a con By my
brother To get me - oh god - he
wanted me to face the Dog to end
it and he gets your money Oh
god I’m going to be sick

PENELOPE
Would he do that To you

BLOOM
I don’t know Yes Yes of course
he would To tell a story so well
it becomes real The perfect con
(MORE )

(MORF)

BLOOM (contd)
That’s his whole goddammit that’s
what

PENELOPE
But you don’t know Let’s transfer
the money You don’t know

BLOOM
Son of a bitch

PENELOPE
You don’t know This is your
brother’s life I’m gonna wire the
money

EXT ST PETERSBURG BANK - DAY

Bloom sits in the car alone He punches the dashboard
again helpless enraged and scared

Penelope gets in looks at the address on the note
PENELOPE
Ok
EXT BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY

Penelope and Bloom sit in the car parked in front of the
impressive facade of a closed burned out old theater

The clock on the dashboard reads 150
BLOOM
I’m so scared Anything I can
imagine finding in there I’m
scared of

PENELOPE
I’m going to be here when you come
out
She kisses him

He puts his hand on the door Hesitates Then goes

Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door
Goes in alone
INT THEATER LOBBY

No lights Moldy dust A genuinely creepy place Bloom
steps lightly deeper into the theater

BLOOM
Stephen
INT THEATER AUDITORIUM

A few lights flicker on the walls fitfully illuminating the
broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage

Bloom walks down the aisle trying to keep his voice steady

BLOOM
Stephen

A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine right in Bloom’s
face He spins trapped in its glare

A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian
When Bloom doesn’t respond the spot swings up to the stage
Bloom gingerly follows it up onto the splintered stage and
through a split in the tarpaulin backdrop
INT THEATER BACKSTAGE
Giant fossils of antique stage scenery Utility lights high
above cut by scaffolding patch everything in dim jagged
forms of light and black

BLOOM

(unsteady )
Stephen Game’s up Come on out

Let’s blow this one hat town

Silence Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on cruelly
lighting Stephen’s face

Shockingly bruised and battered old and new blood
Bloom cries and rushes towards him

STEPHEN
No No Bloom freeze

He obeys Stephen is tied to a chair A dark figure behind
him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand

(MORF)

BLOOM

Stephen who is it Is it the Dog
STEPHEN

Did Penelope wire the money
BLOOM

Yeah
STEPHEN

They’re calling to check right now
Don’t move I’m alright

The dark figure’s cell phone rings he holds it to his ear
for a moment then flips it closed

Something happens in the blackness and Stephen shakily
stands cut loose

STEPHEN (contd)
Stay where you are Bloom I’m
coming to you

He takes a couple wobbly steps

Behind him Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
towards Stephen’s back pulling the hammer

And the utility lamp switches off

BLOOM
No

Bloom’s revolver pops out of his sleeve and he’s firing into
the blackness

Stephen drops flat to the ground

The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness
strobing the scene like stage lightning

Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat but Stephen
lies on his stomach out in the open

BLOOM (cont’d)
Stephen

STEPHEN
Stay back

But Bloom makes a dash for his brother out into the open
unloading three more rounds into the dark

(MORF)

The dark figure returns fire on Bloom who is sprinting full
on his feet in a large pool of light A sitting duck

Stephen launches himself up tackling Bloom backwards

Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat a red
burst of blood flowers from Stephen’s left lower back

Bloom sets him down gently and hears heavy footsteps behind
him

He turns firing but only sees a blur of dark coat go by
through the torn backdrop

Bloom runs out on stage tearing the tarpaulin and fires
after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
lobby

Silence

Bloom walks back to Stephen who lies behind the flat
breathing heavy Blood soaking through his shirt

BLOOM
Please tell me this is all gonna be
ok Tell me that’s a squib and
that’s makeup and that you just
gave me what I always wanted and
pulled off the perfect con

A long long moment

Stephen coughs spits Then a wry grin spreads across his
face

STEPHEN
You said it not me

He stands the shakiness gone

STEPHEN (contd)
Can I get a ‘wow’ for this one

BLOOM
You son of a bitch

Bloom looks like he might hit him but his face breaks and he
embraces him crying The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
a long while holding each other in the spotlight’s glow

Finally Stephen pulls away tears in his eyes He wipes
them wipes blood from his lip

(MORF)

STEPHEN
Tastes like tin foil Alright
here’s what I want you to do Bang
Bang split

BLOOM
Yeah Clean exit

STEPHEN
How

BLOOM
Car bomb

A hint of relief in Stephen’s face

STEPHEN
Good Here’s what Take Penelope
back to Helsinki take that flight
to Rio Lay low like we said
Play out the on-the-run-from-
vengeful-Russians thing that’ll be
fun for her Play it like I’m
dead actually - that’1ll add some
gravity to everything that’1ll be
nice And I’1ll see you when I see
you

BLOOM
Soon

STEPHEN
I hope not Last thing you need is
me hanging around Anyway how
could I top this
Bloom hugs him again

BLOOM
I love you Bye

He turns to go

STEPHEN
Hey Think of any card

Stephen pulls out a pack of cards

BLOOM
Alright

Stephen cuts to the Queen of hearts

(MORF)

BLOOM (cont’d)
Stephen That’s it
(grins)
That’s the best card trick I’ve
ever seen I just wish you had a
bigger audience
STEPHEN
Youre the only audience I’ve ever
needed
Wink Bloom leaves

Stephen watches him go

EXT RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON
Rumbling towards Finland
In the Bug Bloom sleeps in Penelope’s arm while she drives

She looks at his hand on hers his shirt cuff bright red with
Stephen’s “blood” She strokes his shoulder sadly

Off Blooms sleeping face

INT THEATER STAGE

Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage sets it right in
the spotlight’s glare

Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world

Sits Looks at the Queen of Hearts moves his fingers over
it

Then slides is up his sleeve

Blood trickles down his hand

INT BUG - SUNSET
Bloom wakes with a start
PENELOPE
Hey Hey it’s ok The bridge is
coming up we’re almost at the
border Were you dreaming about
Stephen

She strokes his hair back from his face

(MORF)

He nods and looks down at his sleeve

Stephen’s “blood” on his white cuff

Now a dark shade of brown

Bloom looks at this shirt All the blood it’s all brown

He looks up at the road nearly panicked

Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge
BLOOM

Pull over Pull over
EXT ROADSIDE - SUNSET
She does

He bursts out of the car and runtumbles down the grassy
hillside till he finds the car tracks

He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot
Penelope stumbles down after him

PENELOPE
What is it You’re scaring me-

BLOOM
What did you ask the Russian kid
in the Dog’s apartment He said
the Dog isn’t here then what did
you ask

Bloom kicks open the trunk Pries open the blistered attache
case Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the
money from the “Russians” till he finds what he was looking
for and brings it out into the dying light

PENELOPE
How long had he been alone

BLOOM
And what did he say

A scrap of unburned money A fragment of Ben Franklin’s
face

PENELOPE
Since yesterday morning

A single eye gazing up at him the green grass behind it

(MORF)

The eye is perfect No cross hatching

Bloom sinks to his knees

BLOOM

This is real They hassled you
PENELOPE

Bloom-
BLOOM

The Dog was gone before we got
there They hadn’t cleared out of
their apartment they had been
cleared out

INT DIAMOND DOG’S APARTMENT —- DAY FLASHBACK

RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in shooting the Dog’s men
with silenced pistols

The BOY shuts himself in the closet terrified

EXT ROADSIDE - SUNSET

BLOOM
Real Russians Took his store
They didn’t know about his deal
with us but you haggled with them
You really sold the book to real
Russians The Diamond Dog was
gone

EXT RUSSIA HIGHWAY - FLASHBACK

The scene beside the lake our four heroes checking the money
in the attache case

STEPHEN
Let’s get the hell out of Russia

Bloom tosses the gold lighter it splashes into the lake We
follow it plunging beneath the surface

Deep deep down among weak tendrils of light the Diamond Dog
sinks into watery blackness a long blade in his neck
EXT ROADSIDE - SUNSET
BLOOM
And they came after us And
Stephen

Penelope holds him tight

PENELOPE
I know
BLOOM
Stephen saved my life
PENELOPE
I know
BLOOM

He’s gone

Bloom folds into Penelope’s arms but she doesn’t let him
She holds his crying face up

PENELOPE
And he did it so you could live
Your brother loved you He loved
you so much Look at me Stephen
said something once I got the
feeling he’d rather be telling it
to you He said there’s no such
thing as an unwritten life Just
badly written ones I love you
We’re gonna outrun these bastard
Russian mafia and we’re gonna hide
out in Rio then we’re gonna live
like we’re telling the best fucking
story in the world Are you ready

She holds his face close to hers for a long beat Then
smiles and pushes away launching up the grassy hill

Bloom watches her

Time slows as she turns back towards him still running and
holds out her hand for him to follow

BLOOM (VO)
I was thinking of something Stephen
said too “The perfect con is one

where everyone involved gets just
the thing they wanted” Well

He takes the girl’s hand and runs with her towards the point
of light breaking over the hill
EXT HIGHWAY - SUNSET

Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead
The rumbly old VW chugs away from us towards the horizon

FADE OUT
