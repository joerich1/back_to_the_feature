EXT CHURCH - DAY

In the distance a small white CHURCH sits in the middle of
an open field

INT CHURCH SIDE-HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A dining room A painting of Jesus hangs directly above a
fireplace On the other side of the stone wall hangs a shiny

WINCHESTER 1866 RIFLE

A MAN PASTOR THEODORE LOVE — dressed in a black gown and
clerical collar hangs his coat by the door

Behind him his WIFE ELEANOR LOVE finishes prepping the
dinner table A full Sunday feast

Theodore’s SON NATHANIEL LOVE years old sits at the table
holding his tattered two-string guitar

His father smiles and takes the guitar from his son

THEODORE LOVE
Not at the table son

Theodore walks over to Eleanor - they kiss lovingly

Theodore sits at the head of the table - Eleanor sits on his
left - with his son to his right

Little Nathaniel attempts to grab bread from the bowl but his
mother lightly smacks his hand—

ELEANOR
Grace first

THEODORE LOVE
You know better

Eleanor smiles The Pastor his wife and his son hold hands
and bow their heads

THEODORE LOVE (CONTD)
Father we are gathered here to
share this food in your name Bless
this food into our bodies Oh Lord
Bless our hearts in all that we do
Oh Lord so we may walk in your na-

The NEIGH of a horse from seemingly right outside the door
stops the Pastor’s prayer in its tracks The family all look
toward the door in puzzlement

ELEANOR LOVE
Who’1l be out here at this time

THEODORE LOVE
I have no idea

Silence
Then-
BANG BANG

Theodore gets up and walks toward the door A weary caution
is upon him

He opens the door

IE CHURCH SIDE-HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A TALL MAN in a trench coat and Stetson stands before him
FIVE MORE MEN in trench coats on horseback dismounting their
horses behind him These are not law-abiding men

The Pastor stares closely at the Man Theodore’s eyes fill
with shock and fear as though he is staring at the Grim
Reaper

Theodore’s mouth opens-

THEODORE LOVE (CONTD)
No

The acoustic folk song ‘THREE AND THIRTY YEARS’ PLAYS on the
soundtrack

Theodore quivers in fear He looks up a shiny WINCHESTER
1866 RIFLE hanging on the stone wall

The Man calmly brushes Theodore to the side and enters his
home Theodore follows him ONE OF THE OTHER MEN walk inside
behind the Pastor

EI CHURCH SIDE-HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Man walks to the Mother and Son seated at the table
Theodore pleads to him

THEODORE LOVE (CONTD)
Leave my family alone please
The Man’s Henchman stands behind little Nathaniel and places
his hand on the boy’s shoulders ensuring he cannot move

The Henchman’s hand bears the TATTOO OF A SCORPION

The Man the Pastor called ‘RUFUS’ pulls out two COLT ARMY
REVOLVERS with checkered ivory grips and heavy leaf engraving
on a SOLID GOLD finish

He points his guns at Eleanor and Nathaniel Theodore shakes
tearfully

ELEANOR
Theodore

THEODORE LOVE
It’s okay It’s okay

Eleanor and Nat are frozen with fear

THEODORE LOVE (CONTD)
Leave them out of this

The Man COCKS back each hammer

THEODORE LOVE (CONTD)
Your quarrel is with me Let’s go
outside take a walk and handle our
business PleasePlease I’m
begging you

The Man calmly BLOWS Eleanor to Kingdom Come Theodore
SCREAMS—

Eleanor FLIES BACKWARDS and hits the wall Dead on impact
Theodore and Nathaniel SCREAM The Pastor runs to his wife
STILL SCREAMING Little Nathaniel struggles in vain to get

free of the Henchman

Theodore Love holds his Wife’s body - seemingly begging God
in ERRATIC PRAYER

Theodore looks up at the Man in fury and LUNGES towar- BANG
BANG

The Pastor CRASHES back to the floor- Dead at his wife’s
side

NATHANIEL SCREAMS—
NATHANIEL LOVE
NO

He puts his guns back into the holsters and turns to the son
NATHANIEL WEEPS AS

-The Man takes out a SHAVING RAZOR with a red handle and
stands

-THE HENCHMAN GRIPS NATHANIEL BY THE CHIN-

-The Man walks over to Nathaniel Love and CARVES the blade
into the boy’s forehead

SOME TIME LATER

INT CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

The front doors open and the Priest steps inside backlit by
the sun’s red rays He stops as he sees

A SINGLE FIGURE kneeling at a pew in front of the altar in
the otherwise vacant church The PRIEST calls out in Spanish

PRIEST
Father Esparza I’m here for
confessionand the collection
You know what happens when you’re
late with my coins

FIGURE
What possesses a man to paint a
scorpion on his hand

The Priest takes a step forward into the light and we see
the face of JESUS CORTEZ A white clerical collar encircles
his neck
CORTEZ
Excuse me

The figure in the pews raises a black hat and puts it on its
head Stands and turns revealing himself to be a YOUNG MAN
wearing a dark coat His hat is low casting a shadow over
his steely eyes This is NAT LOVE

NAT
A snake I understand that the
Garden of Eden Bible et cetera
But a scorpion That puzzles me

Cortez’s demeanor changes from quizzical to nervous

CORTEZ
Who are you

NAT
A man here to kill The Scorpion
Jesus Cortez

Cortez and Nat lock eyes CLOSE ON CORTEZ’S HAND— TATTOOED
WITH A SCORPION— He almost tries to conceal it

CORTEZ
Those were different times
Whatever happened between you and I
must’ve been a long time ago

Nat Love removes his hat revealing AN INDENTED SCAR OF A
CRUCIFIX ON HIS FOREHEAD

Cortez looks closely has a moment of realization

CORTEZ (CONTD)
(shocked)
No

NAT
(softly)
No

CORTEZ
(regretfully)
Please

NAT
(simply)
Please

CORTEZ
(fearfully)
I’m sorry
NAT
(peacefully)
I’m sorry

Cortez has no choice - He reaches down to open his robe- and
reveals a GUN-BELT with TWO SIX-GUNS

Nat moves aside the flap of his coat revealing a GUN at his
own hip

Cortez draws his gun with great speed but

Nat draws faster and fires— BANG Hits Cortez right in the
chest— FREEZE FRAME

THE

Another shot from Nat hits him in the heart— FREEZE
HARDER

Another shot sends him off his feet— FREEZE

THEY
Another shot catches Cortez in the middle of the air— FREEZE

FALL

Cortez slams down to the ground in a cloud of dust and blood

Nat holsters his gun Walks over to Cortez and looks down at
him

Nat reaches down and pulls the collar off Cortez’s neck
Then from OS

SCARED VOICE
Is it over

Nat sees the terrified FATHER ESPARZA peeking out from behind
the pulpit

He folds the collar and puts it into his pocket

NAT
This is a wanted man Turn his body
in youll have five thousand
dollars for your church

FATHER ESPARZA
Why aren’t you taking him in
yourself
NAT
I’m worth ten

Nat flips open the cylinder of his pistol The voice of ELVIS
PRESLEY singing ‘CRYING IN THE CHAPEL’ blasts on the SOUND-
TRACK as Nat puts bullets in the chamber Then he turns
tips his hat to Father Esparza and

EXT CHURCH - MOMENTS LATER

-- THE DUB BASS-LINE BENEATH ELVIS’ VOICE KICKS IN as Nat
Love swings up onto his horse prods its flanks and rides
out of town This is a different version of the song This
is a different version of a Western

Opening titles appear over
A HORSES GALLOPING HOOVES

Churning up the ground -- WIDEN OUT to see EIGHT MENACING
RIDERS on horseback wearing CRIMSON HOODS with the eyes and
mouth cut out riding toward us at full speed

CLOSE ANGLES ON THE CANVAS BAGS hanging off the backs of the
horses -- ONE BAG has a slash in it and A FEW FIVE DOLLAR
BILLS FLY OUT whipping into the air

WIDE ON THE RIDERS so wide they look like dots in a cloud of
dust riding over the rough terrain SUPER

Indian Territory Kansas border

CAMERA TILTS DOWN to reveal TWO MEN in the fg pressed back
against jutting rocks TWO COWBOYS — BILL PICKETT and JIM
BECKWOURTH early 20s Pickett flips a coin and gazes behind
him

Pickett begins CHANTING AN OLD NEGRO SPIRITUAL-
PICKETT
Upon my return See a changing
soul
Pickett cocks his WINCHESTER
PICKETT (CONTD)
That a walk was far And way too

long

The Gang ride through the passage galloping to the other
side
PICKETT (CONTD)
They’1l run from me As they ran
from you That fear in me In a
distant view

And— BLAM A rifle shot rings out A near-impossible shot
ONE of the eight men flies off his horse

BLAM -- A SECOND MAN falls back in his saddle

The remaining SIX spin their horses around drawing their
guns—

ANGLE ON PICKETT

Ensconced behind a rock his rifle leveled as deadly a shot
as there ever was— he FIRES TWO MORE TIMES— BLAM -- BLAM

-- Killing A THIRD MAN and wounding another The gang’s
leader tough MONROE GRIMES leaps off his horse’s back and
gets behind it He pulls his hood off and shouts to his men—

BLAM -- Pickett finishes off the wounded man The remaining
THREE manage to climb off their horses and get behind rocks
blocking themselves from Pickett’s sights

ANGLE ON PICKETT -- Taking careful aim and— BLAM

-- Shoots one of the men in the leg The man goes down
screaming and—

Monroe SHOOTS HIS OWN HORSE in the head and pulls it down to
the ground tucking down behind it

He pulls out his RIFLE from his saddle braces it on his dead
horse’s flank and FIRES accurately at—

PICKETT who is forced to duck down as
THE OTHER THREE MEN see the direction their leader is firing

in two of them level PISTOLS and the third gets his RIFLE
and all of them fire at the spot Pickett is hiding behind

PICKETT scrunches down BULLETS flying all around him

MONROE
Stop firing It’s one man We got
him pinned

THE BANDITS stop shooting staying behind their horses
keeping their guns leveled in Pickett’s direction
MONROE (CONTD) (CONTD)
Wait for his to head show then
blow naps off that muthafucka Be
patient

BECKWOURTH (0S)
I hear patience is a virtue—

THE SURPRISED BANDITS spin around to see
JIM BECKWOURTH

Standing behind them Crazily his hands are empty hanging
by the sides of his still HOLSTERED PISTOLS

BECKWOURTH (CONTD)
-- But I ain’t never been able to
wait to see if the muthafucka true

Clyde and Beckwourth continue arguing back and forth in front
of the BANDITS

CLYDE

Clyde and the BANDITS draw their weapons but

BECKWOURTH is lightning-fast -- He draws BOTH GUNS AND FIRES
THEM— instantly taking down TWO MEN-- FIRES and nails Clyde

BECKWOURTH

PICKETT who has arisen from behind his rock and is walking
toward them furious shouting at Beckwourth

BLAM Without looking Beckwourth BLOWS AWAY THE HIDDEN
PISTOL that the dogged MONROE drew from his boot out of his
hand

BECKWOURTH (CONTD)

Monroe keeps trying crawling to his gun as the two men
approach him

Beckwourth kicks the gun further away from Monroe

vicious LAUGH

Pickett hesitates Monroe’s laughter ringing in his ears

THE RHYTHMIC DRUM OF ‘HARD TIMES’ BY PABLO GAD RINGS OVER THE
SOUNDTRACK

CLOSE ON NAT LOVE -- riding down the street in a raucous town
that is a total contrast to Redwood This is clearly a place
populated with lawbreakers SUPER

SLO-MO ANGLES on various MEN and WOMEN looking at Nat as he
rides by some recognizing him giving respectful nods

CUFFEE

CUFFEE
No but you right famous around
these parts Folk say you once cut
down three men with one bullet

CAMERA SWINGS OVER to see that the wall is covered with GUNS
hanging from nails hammered into the brick

CUFFEE (CONTD)
I ain’t met a man who can do that
yet Excuse me—

A COUPLE OF ARMED HARDCASES have entered through the doors
behind Nat

CUFFEE (CONTD)
Evening Gents Kindly check your
weapons and enjoy your evening

HARDCASE 1
I’d sooner check my right arm boy

The Hardcases shove past Cuffee who reaches out and holds
Hardcase 1s arm

CUFFEE
Then you could walk ‘cross the way
to Jourdan Anderson’s You could
hold guns and drink there

HARDCASE 1
We drinking here you puny little
fuck

Hardcase 1 pulls free and takes a swing at Cuffee— but
Cuffee isn’t there— ducking quickly and easily under the
blow coming up with a vicious punch to the man’s face that
knocks him flat to the ground

Hardcase 2 spins but Cuffee kicks him in the nuts doubling
him over then finishes him with several quick nasty punches
to the face It’s over before it started

CUFFEE
Of course some folk tend to feel a
way regardless

Nat looks on amused as Cuffee wipes his BLOODY BRASS
KNUCKLES on one of the men’s jackets and takes out their
GUNS as a FEW MORE MEN step past Nat

CUFFEE (CONTD)
Get ‘em over to Doc Brown’s And
take they guns over to the Sheriff
He can give ‘em back when they
leave town

The men pick up the two Hardcases and carry them out Nat
turns his gaze to Cuffee

NAT
What they call you

CUFFEE
They call me Cuffee

Nat hears a loud scraping sound that causes him to turn his
head

CLOSE ON THE BARREL OF A SHOTGUN

BANGING ON THE FLOORBOARDS TILT UP TO REVEAL

A STOVE-TOP HAT WEARING FIERCE-EYED WOMAN - AFRICAN TRIBAL
PAINT ON HALF OF HER FACE

Clad in a bright red corseted dress walking toward the
stage holding the shotgun dragging its barrel across the
floor This is STAGECOACH MARY The crowd bursts into a
cacophony of stomping and cheering as the trio of musicians
who have never stopped playing shift into a new gear and

Mary BANGS her shotgun barrel on the floor rhythmically and
BEGINS SINGING a raw and upbeat CALL AND RESPONSE NUMBER
called ‘THE JIM CROW COUNT’ -- The crowd is enraptured
pounding along with the song

ANGLE ON NAT
More entranced than anyone in the room He almost absent-

mindedly hands his guns to Cuffee and drifts forward as if
in a dream

CLOSE ON MARY

Singing with a straightforward sexy unadorned voice taking
in her audience then her eyes widen as she sees

Nat Love moving through the crowd looking right into her
eyes

Their eye-contact is electric Mary can barely finish her
song but she manages to make it to the end the sound of
APPLAUSE fading into a blur

Mary walks down from the stage toward Nat

NAT
You still ain’t talkin’ to me

They meet in the middle of the saloon and instantly are
locked in a deep passionate profound kiss that lasts and
lasts No one in the stunned crowd has seen anything like it

in public

CLOSE ON MARY AND NAT -- She finally breaks the kiss and
whispers in his ear
MARY
Get out
NAT
What

Mary looks into Nat’s eyes

MARY
I said— leave

NAT
Then what was that kiss for then

MARY
To remind me of what it was This—

Mary hauls off and PUNCHES Nat in the face She can hit Nat
staggers back a step or two— it looks like that’s it— then
his legs give out some more and he falls back onto a small
table surrounded by cowboys and whores and takes the whole
damn thing down with him to the floor

MARY (CONTD)
That’s to remind you of what it is

Mary turns and walks out of the saloon over Nat’s body

MARY (CONTD)
Cuffee clean this man up

Nat clambers back to his feet His hat has been knocked off
his head fully revealing the crucifix on his forehead Eyes
widen all over the saloon

Nat looks for his hat then turns to see

Cuffee has picked it up and is holding it out to him Nat
takes the hat Cuffee speaks softly

with his hands held high Mary is across the room her back
turned to him - she wipes the tribal paint from her face

NAT

MARY
That’s about the only thing I need

‘Goodbye Mary’

NAT
The one thing you’1l never hear me

wild as it ever was I made things

MaryThat Mary won’t shy away

Mary’s eyes are gleaming her face close to Nat’s

Nat whispers—

NAT (CONTD)

Nat reaches into his pocket and we see him take out a GOLD
WEDDING BAND Mary doesn’t see it

MARY
That’s some bullshit Pickett used
to say Apache called me Coyote
Woman

NAT
Wolf Lady is more like you

Mary turns and kisses Nat hard They lock in a passionate
embrace getting hotter then

Nat and Mary simultaneously hear something Nat quickly
grabs a SMALLER PISTOL from his breast pocket Mary snatches
up her SHOTGUN and they move away from the door levelling
their weapons All this took three seconds

From outside the door—
VOICE (0S)

AN UGLY LAUGHTER is audible from the outside of this
ramshackle stable

INT STABLE - DOUGLASTOWN - CONTINUOUS

MONROE GRIMES— weathered and worn— looks up at the sound of
the door being flung open He grins through bloodied teeth—

MONROE
Well well well if it ain’t the
debonair dipshit himself

Nat strides right past Beckwourth drawing his pistol and
pressing it hard against Monroe’s forehead—

PICKETT
Whoa Easy Nat— listen to what the

NAT
So he can tell me the same stories

MONROE

Nat knocks Monroe down
NAT

MONROE

NAT
On your feet

Monroe stops laughing

NAT (CONTD)
Exhale

Monroe squeezes his eyes shut BANG Nat severs the rope
binding Monroe’s wrists with a single shot

NAT (CONTD)
Now Get out of here

Monroe can’t believe it He looks around at the rest of the
Nat Love Gang who might just be as surprised as he is

NAT (CONTD)
Leave

Monroe rises to his feet and quickly runs out of the back of
the stable

Nat puts the gun back into its holster

PICKETT
What you doin’ We coulda killed
last of the Crimson Hoods right
there

NAT
It’s called the Crimson Hood Gang
You think that’s the last one

Takes a few steps toward the stable doors then he stops
right in front of Mary but does not make eye contact with
her

A still moment Then Nat continues on and exits the stable
leaving the other three behind

BECKWOURTH
Ida bet my left 6-shooter he was
bout to kill that man
MARY
If that man telling the truth Nat
just did him a whole lot worse

Cherokee Bill is genuinely perplexed

CHEROKEE BILL
You must be the hero Great spirit

Cherokee mockingly makes a boxing fight stance and gestures
from the Man to come forth- The Man charges forth and swings
at Cherokee -- Cherokee easily ducks the blow and puts his
hand out behind his back and as if in a rehearsed routine
Trudy takes a CARVING KNIFE from her bag and puts it in
Cherokee’s hand and

-- with lightning speed Cherokee SLICES each of the man’s
thighs then calves and the man falls to the floor in agony

CHEROKEE BILL (CONTD)
See my point Now please can you

conclude our business here without
further ado

The terrified passengers crush to the sides of the car and
Cherokee Trudy and the other two men move to the next car—

CHEROKEE BILL
No

YOUNG SOLDIER

All in precise unison Trudy and the bandits behind her aim
their weapons at the passengers

The frightened soldier lowers his gun Cherokee approaches

solder that you want Now I
suggest we make a peaceful
exchange and everybody lives to
see another day Sound dandy

LT GENERAL
Just let the boy go and-

Trudy SHOOTS the young soldier in the arm The passengers in
the carriage SCREAM

YOUNG SOLDIER
(in agony)
I’m okay Pa

The penny drops Cherokee smiles

CHEROKEE BILL
That is just a flesh wound sir You
have ten seconds to lay down your
weapons and open the door or your
kin shall perish

LT GENERAL
Harm him further and I’1l kill
every last one of you godless sons
of bitches

Too much damned talking Trudy SHOOTS the soldier in the leg
The passengers scream Trudy stares coldly at them Silence

CHEROKEE BILL
Damn Trudy you know I like my
countdowns

CHEROKEE BILL (CONTD)
My apologies sir My friend here
doesn’t like arithmetic Be that as
it may— seven seconds

Cherokee Bill starts his countdown from six
The Lt General turns to his men

LT GENERAL
Lay down your rifles

The soldiers hesitate

LT GENERAL (CONTD)
I said lay them down

The soldiers put down their rifles SPLIT SCREEN ENDS as

The Lt General opens the door and walks backward toward the
metal box

CHEROKEE BILL
Alright Thank you kindly Go ahead
and walk boy

Cherokee enters the carriage with his gun held to the young
soldier’s temple Trudy behind him She steps to the sliding
door on the side of the carriage and opens it revealing

The rest of the gang outside They step up into the car
guns leveled at the soldiers

CHEROKEE BILL (CONTD)
Keep walkin’ just keep movin’ No
one do anything stupid

(MORE)

CHEROKEE BILL (CONTD)
Just walk like you’ve been taught
LEFT RIGHT LEFT LEFT RIGHT LEFT
Skip to the loo my darlin’

Trudy walks to the metal box and runs her hand over it There
is a key lock attached

TRUDY
Open it

LT GENERAL
I can’t The key is back in Yuma
Next key is waiting

Cherokee cocks his hammer and the Young Soldier squeezes his
eyes shut when

ONE OF THE SOLDIERS reaches for his rifle Cherokee SHOOTS
him in the head with lightning speed

TRUDY (CONTD)
One more time

LT GENERAL
You’1l be hounded to the ends of
the earth for this

TRUDY
I don’t like long distances Lt
General Abbott Ever cross your
mind why you were given the task
of transporting a lone outlaw from
one prison to another

The Lt General’s eyes widen as Trudy steps close to him-

Trudy takes a letter from her coat and shows it to the Lt
General

TRUDY (CONTD)
Full pardon for Mr Buck and his
associates for all misdeeds
Signed General George Pryce

LT GENERAL
(in disbelief)
General Pryce What’s this about

Trudy returns the pardon to inside her coat pocket

TRUDY
Well He came to us with a
proposition- Kill a particular
Officiant Of The Goddamned Law
(MORE)

TRUDY (CONTD)
A man so crooked that even the
government is embarrassed by his
misdeeds Apparently you and your
men wiped out an entire town women
and children included to steal
silver

TRUDY and CHEROKEE BILL
Now That’s some unscrupulous shit

The General pulls out a set of keys from his jacket and
UNLOCKS the door of the box He backs away as the door swings
open slowly

With a slight smile RUFUS walks out of the box acknowledging
Trudy and Cherokee Rufus exhales

Trudy turns and stares at the General The General quickly
unlocks Rufus’s hands then unlocks the shackles around his
ankles

Rufus stares at the Lt General He turns to Cherokee

LT GENERAL
Please Ill disappear No one
will see me aga-

Cherokee FIRES a bullet through the Lt General’s chest
hurling his body backward Dead on impact

The Lt General’s son SCREAMS

One of the gang comes forward and hands Rufus guns a gun
belt and a black hat

REVERSE ONTO RUFUS’S FACE He addresses the soldiers his
voice like a lion’s roar

RUFUS BUCK
Who here can drive a train

Weeping the Lt General’s son shakily raises his hand Rufus
turns to Trudy and Cherokee Bill

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
Everyone but him

Trudy Cherokee Bill and the gang begin SHOOTING the crooked
soldiers in the carriage It is a bloody scene The soldiers
scurry ducking and reaching for the guns already on the
floor to no avail

Slow Motion on Rufus walking through the flying bodies and
GUNFIRE oblivious to it

EXT TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

Rufus Buck sits on horseback on the middle of the tracks
flanked either side by his gang as they watching the train
leave

MCU ON RUFUS as Barrington Levy’s voice blares out

“Tm broad”

CUT TO CLOSE SHOT ON CHEROKEE BILL

“Tm broad”

CUT TO CLOSE SHOT ON TRUDY

“T’m broader than Broadway”

CUT TO CLOSE SHOT ON RUFUS

INT STAGECOACH MARY’S SALOON - NIGHT

Nat Love sitting alone at a small table stares into camera
We move in closer and closer until we are TIGHT ON HIS
EYES THE MUSIC FADES

-- were back in Nat looks up pulled out of his revery as
the sound of the saloon rises to full volume His eyes
narrow as he sees

CASH FLOATS IN THE AIR in SLO-MO -- SONG CONTINUES AS WE RACK
to

JIM BECKWOURTH at the bar tossing the money in the air
surrounded by laughing LADIES OF THE NIGHT who grab for the
bills he takes the BOTTLE that is handed to him as we
continue our slow-motion tracking shot into the Saloon

-- PAST COUPLES DANCING in the open space behind the bar
past GAMBLERS at the poker tables until we reach a table
where

-- BILL PICKETT and MARY sitting together with untouched
drinks Pickett is spinning his lucky coin Mary looking
disapprovingly toward the bar where Beckwourth is carousing
and shaking her head She then turns and gazes behind
herself and we CONTINUE TRACKING past in the direction of
her look toward

A TALL MAN IN BLACK

Standing in the doorway taking in the saloon Cuffee
approaches him-

CUFFEE
Evening sir Check your weapons
with me and enjoy what’s left of
the night

The man turns pulls the lapel of his jacket back and reveals
a TIN BADGE pinned to his vest This is US DEPUTY MARSHAL
BASS REEVES

CUFFEE (CONTD)
No need to show me that star I
know who you is In here though I
be the sheriff which makes Miss
Mary the Marshal And the Marshal
say no one comes in here gunned up
or they might could get gunned
down

BASS REEVES
My badge begs to differ

Cuffee knows it’s the truth Reeves continues walking through
the smoky space He shoots a dry look in the direction of

JIM BECKWOURTH AT THE BAR
Surrounded by the ladies who are shoving cash into their
décolletage and showering him with kisses Beckwourth sees

the Marshal and slowly walks from the bar-

BECKWOURTH
Excuse me

Reeves keeps walking and stops in front of Nat Love who
looks evenly at him from over his half-empty whiskey glass

NAT
So how you intend on taking me in
Marshal Staring me to death

BASS REEVES
How about just death

ANGLE ON MARY AND PICKETT
Bass Reeves opens his coat
ANGLE ON MARY - SHOTGUN leveled at Reeves

Bass Reeves doesn’t flinch for a second He reaches in his
pocket-—
CLACK She pulls the hammer back but

Reeves pulls out a pipe- A match- Lights it Puffs

Nat smiles coolly— gives a slight nod in Mary’s direction
and Mary lowers the shotgun but puts it down on the table

where she can reach it

Reeves pulls a chair from the next table and sits opposite

Nat Indicates the WHISKEY BOTTLE

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
Mind

Nat slides his glass over

NAT
Never known you to touch it

BASS REEVES
Only after I kill a man Or before

Reeves fills the glass

BASS REEVES(CONTD) (CONTD)

I was on the trail of the Crimson
Hood gang on account of a bank
robbery in Kansas City Turns out
someone got to them before me

NAT
You know I don’t rob banks

BASS REEVES
But you rob them that do which is
all the same to me

NAT
Texas I was in Texas at the time
of that robbery

BASS REEVES
How you know when it took place

NAT
Whenever any robbery takes place I
was in Texas Unless the robbery is
in Texas

Bass smiles reaches for the glass and fills it

again

BASS REEVES
Way I hear it some of them boys
with the Crimson Hoods was part of
a new Rufus Buck gang

Bass looks for a reaction from Nat who just says—

NAT
Rufus is in Yuma

BASS REEVES
He’s out But you already knew
that

NAT

Then why you here drinking my
liquor when you should be out
rounding up deputies to bring him
to justice

BASS REEVES
He’s been pardoned

Nat’s eyes narrow— he does his best to keep his disbelief in
check

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
Rufus Buck has been absolved of his
countless depredations Free again
to roam God’s green earth

Bass studies Nat for a beat then—

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
But seeing as I’ve been scouring
this terrain for bank robbers and
such that particular piece of news
has failed to reach me

Nat looks up locking eyes with Bass
ANGLE ON MARY AND PICKETT WATCHING INTENTLY

MARY
What they saying

PICKETT
Something about guns killing
Mary why you let that little kid
take my gun like that What kinda
stupid rule is that Should be four
guns pointing at

MARY
Shut up Pickett

ANGLES ON BECKWOURTH AND CUFFEE--watching like hawks at the
ready Then all of a sudden—

-- Nat picks up his glass and splashes his drink in Bass
Reeves’s face - Mary swiftly aims her gun at the marshal

Bass stands and draws both of his guns in one smooth
motion— one pointed at Nat the other toward Mary Cuffee
cocks a gun pointed at the Marshal

BASS REEVES
(to Mary)
If you shoot he’s dead If you
miss all of you die

Nat casually lights his cigar

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
(to Cuffee)
You come here

Cuffee looks to Mary for some indication of what to do She
gives none

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
Take these cuffs Cuff this man or
I put three in his chest right now
to lessen the trouble

Mary nods at Cuffee Cuffee steps over to Bass Reeves and
takes the handcuffs from him

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
(to Nat)
Tell this young buck to back up

NAT
Easy Jim

Cuffee cuffs Nat then steps back as Reeves reaches over and
pulls him to his feet Reeves turns to the hushed saloon

BASS REEVES
Everybody in here knows who I am
I’m taking Nat Love to Fort Smith
to be tried Anyone tries to follow
me to save him well you know
what I do y’all enjoy the rest
of the evening

EXT MAYOR’S ROAD - MORNING

A SINGLE ELECTRIC GUITAR NOTE SCREAMS ON THE SOUNDTRACK AS A
THUDDING BASS-LINE KICKS INTO A SLOWED DOWN REMIX OF ‘KILLER’
BY ADAMSKI SEAL’S VOCAL SCREAMS as RUFUS BUCK

Enters frame Still in his jail clothes he sits like a
warlord atop his steed right at the end of Main Street

SIX RIDERS appear either side of him -- to his left led by
Trudy Smith - to his right led by Cherokee Bill -- THE
CITIZENS out in the street stop what they are doing

Title
REDWOOD CITY

THE GANG rides down the center of Main Street drawing
frightened looks and hushed whispers as they pass

ANGLE ON A SECOND-STORY WINDOW FROM WHICH WILEY ESCOE

Is watching the GANG reflected in the window-pane in front
of him

INT REDWOOD BANK - MOMENTS LATER

The bank doors open and Rufus Buck enters the bank followed
by Trudy Smith and lastly Cherokee Bill The CUSTOMERS AND
TELLERS in the bank fall silent as the trio passes through
and stride toward the manager’s office Cherokee Bill opens
the door

INT BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The bank manager BEN HODGES slick but possessing the face
of a shady past sits at his desk He looks through his
office window at Trudy Cherokee and Rufus Buck walking
through the bank-

Rufus and Trudy walk in -- Cherokee behind them Ben steps
over and speaks with a confidence few can display in Redwood-

BEN HODGES
Cherokee Bill Ms Smith morning
to you both Mr Buck glad to have
you back in Redwood sir

Rufus nods
TRUDY

Any word on the take from the
Kansas City bank

BEN HODGES
The Crimson Hoods took it for
twenty-five thousand dollars but
they were ambushed before they got
here

TRUDY
Everybody knows it’s suicide to
take from us

BEN HODGES
Someone obviously disagrees

CHEROKEE BILL
God damn it That will put us right
back where we started How we
supposed to build a Mecca without
any bricks

Trudy steps close to Ben

CLOSE ON RUFUS -- his eyes blazing calculating as from
behind him-

TRUDY (0S)
We’re going to have to take it out
of our own bank

BEN HODGES (0S)
We don’t hold that kind of money
Trudy We maybe got a few pennies
over a twenty five hundred dollars
cash

RUFUS BUCK
What he say

BEN HODGES (0S)
Twenty-five

RUFUS BUCK
I heard you

TRUDY
Wiley

CHEROKEE BILL
Yeah

RUFUS BUCK
Sure is hot ain’t it

Rufus snaps forward and walks out of the bank

EXT MAYOR’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

A TWO-STORY affair lodged in between the general store and
barber-shop SEVERAL ARMED GUARDS are standing outside the
front door They nervously put their hands on their guns as
Rufus approaches

But Rufus strides right up to the steps and stands in the
midst of the armed GUARDS

Rufus looks at CARSON THE GUARD LEADER and the other men
just a look

INT WILEY ESCOE’S OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

Sheriff Badge gleaming on his lapel Wiley Escoe sits at his
table chowing down on a bloody steak- looking directly into
the camera - obviously talking to Rufus-

WILEY ESCOE
Rufus Buck Look at you a relic of
yesteryear with nothing And now
you think can roll into my town and
take what belong to me Who in the
fuck you think I am Ain’t nobody
scared of you and ain’t nobody
runnin’ I’m a sinister
motherfucker too One click of my
finger and you disappear So I
suggest you leave before I finish
my steak And if you even think of
sticking arou-

-KNOCK KNOCK - THE DOOR - Wiley Escoe looks up

CUT TO WIDE - We see Wiley Escoe is alone - talking to
himself

Carson and the second guard step in

WILEY ESCOE(CONTD) (CONTD)
Come in

CARSON
Sheriff Mr Buck wants to see you
out front

Wiley nervously pauses
WILEY ESCOE

Tell that man I ain’t got nothing
to say to him

Carson draws his weapon to Wiley’s surprise

CARSON
It wasn’t a request

EXT REDWOOD MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Wiley Escoe steps out into the sunlight followed by Carson
and other guards

Rufus is standing in the middle of the street Trudy
Cherokee and his gang all around him A crowd has gathered in
the center of town people watching from the wooden
sidewalks from behind doors and windows

Wiley walks into the street and stands in front of Rufus

RUFUS BUCK
Wiley Escoe

WILEY ESCOE
Rufus

Rufus just looks at Wiley Wiley steps toward Rufus Hands
close on guns all around them Wiley stops close enough to
Rufus so that they’re the only two who can hear one another

RUFUS BUCK
You wanna sell this town While I
rot in prison

WILEY ESCOE
The world you knew is gone A flood
is coming and you think you can
hold onto this place when it hits
I know enough to get mine and get
out Kill me and you’1l have
nothing

Rufus almost smiles

RUFUS BUCK
You know a man like you will have
us all subservient till the end of
our days so long as you can buy
yourself a house a badge and
them goddamn gold teeth

Rufus then reaches down to his gun-belt unclasps it and
takes it off He hands the belt and guns to Trudy Smith

Wiley is confused for just an instant Then he gets it

WILEY ESCOE
You wanna do this here

Rufus and Wiley face each other in the middle of the street
This is the kind of tough that doesn’t exist in the world
anymore

Wiley comes at Rufus and

THROWS WILDLY Glimpsed by the first punch Rufus moves just
an inch making Wiley’s next blow a miss

In one motion Rufus takes his gun from the hand of Trudy-
who was at the ready- and GUNBUTTS WILEY IN THE FACE Wiley
falls to the floor in agony

We see angles on the faces of the onlookers ordinary
citizens children The Gunmen Cherokee Bill and
Trudy Smith who smiles

Rufus kneels down to Wiley- holds him at the back of his head
and- VICIOUSLY GUNBUTTS HIM REPEATEDLY until the sound of the
gun hitting Wiley’s gold teeth- knocks two of them out-

RUFUS BUCK
Oh shit I done hit gold Hey Boy
Come get that gold Tell your mama
you rich now Go ahead

Woody the Redwood kid sneakily picks up the teeth and
pockets them

Rufus stands over the barely conscious Wiley Escoe

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
I’m not going to kill you Wiley
We were friends once

Rufus speaks softly—

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
But know this Redwood will never
be yours Never Matter of fact you
ain’t welcome here no more Now I
want you to vacate immediately or
die where you lay

The crowd looks on in mute disbelief

HOLD ON WILEY

On his back bleeding and broken as Rufus turns and walks
away followed by Cherokee Trudy Smith and every other
gunman on Main Street including Wiley’s former men The
entire town knows one thing

Rufus Buck is Back

EXT WATERING HOLE - DAY

BASS REEVES’ WAGON approaches across the prairie Reeves
sitting on the buckboard He pulls his horses to a stop by
the watering hole

BACK OF THE WAGON Bass Reeves opens the door revealing Nat
still chained

NAT
You know you coulda taken these
off a while back

BASS REEVES
Yep

Nat steps off the wagon Reeves reaches over and unlocks the
cuffs from Nat’s wrists

Reeves smiles dismissively - walks to the side of the wagon
and pulls out a shovel

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
Tell me something How you know
Rufus will be in Redwood

NAT
He’s taking the money from the
Crimson Hoods That’s where he’1l
be

BASS REEVES
And now you’re teaming up with a
marshal to bring him in

NAT
I ain’t not bringing him in I’m
bringing him down And we ain’t
teaming up old man Your life’s
expendable Marshal My gang’s
ain’t Shit since we’re out here
I oughta tell you I was fixin’
to kill you when you and your
fellas brought in Rufus

BASS REEVES
A lot of men be fixing son
They always seem to die before they
get the job done And just for the
record I took Rufus in alone

He hands Nat a rifle and-
There is a RUSTLE from nearby—

Both men snap around Nat raising the rifle Reeves pulling
out his pistols standing back-to-back then

SEVERAL MOUNTED FIGURES emerge from the trees around the
watering hole -- revealing themselves to be STAGECOACH MARY
BILL PICKETT JIM BECKWOURTH and CUFFEE

Reeves shoots Nat a suspicious look -- But Nat is truly
surprised

NAT
Mary I figured youd be halfway to
Fort Smith by now

Mary climbs off her horse Bass Reeves tenses—

MARY
You can put down them guns
Marshal this ain’t a ambush But
you—
(points at Nat)
You on the other hand might want
to keep yours handy

Mary steps up in front of Nat Glares into his eyes—

MARY (CONTD)
You really think I’m stupid enough
to fall for that bullshit y’all
pulled in my saloon

NAT
I don’t want you mixed up in this
anymore

MARY

Then you should have told me so

PICKETT
I must confess to some raw feelings
myself

NAT
This ain’t no road to ask a friend
to travel

Nat speaks quietly to Pickett—

NAT (CONTD)
Now you take that money you took
off them Crimson Hoods and buy that
ranch you’re always blabbing about

PICKETT
That’s mighty generous of you but
that ain’t how this gang works
Nat Take stays in the usual place
ready to be shared three ways when
we come back

NAT
Ain’t no coming back from this
(to the others)
Now get out of here All of you
This ain’t your fight

MARY
You take on the Devil himself
you’re gonna need more than just
you and the Marshal

BASS REEVES
I seen the devil and Rufus Buck
ain’t him The devil’s white

Jim Beckwourth laughs Nat turns to him-

NAT
You got a reason you want to die
Jim

BECKWOURTH

Outside of you saving me from this

Beckwourth pulls down his collar to reveal a deep scar around
the entirety of his neck

BECKWOURTH (CONTD)
Besides— Monroe said Cherokee Bill
run with Rufus Every time I speak
on my speed a muthafucka pull
Cherokee Bill out they ass I’ma
put an end to that argument once
and for all Like it say in the
Book of Clarence “No man out-speed
me-

PICKETT
-Out-speed ain’t a word and
Clarence ain’t a book I’m kinda
hopin’ Cherokee put a bullet in
your ass just to shut you up

Cuffee reaches into a saddle-bag and pulls out Nat’s GUN-BELT
AND PISTOLS

CUFFEE
You left these on my wall Mr
Love Figured if we was going after
villains you’ll need em

Nat takes the guns from Cuffee

NAT
Obliged

Mary turns to her horse unties NAT’S HORSE from her own and
hands Nat the reins A moment of eye-contact between them
then she turns and swings up into her saddle

MARY
What are y’all waitin’ for You
think destiny coming to you
Mary urges her horse to a gallop and we
HOLD ON NAT
Watching her ride for a moment then he swings himself up

onto his own horse The instrumental of ‘THE HARDER THEY
FALL’ BLARES ON THE SOUND-TRACK as we cut to

THE NEW NAT LOVE GANG

Galloping across the prairie with Bass Reeves bringing up
the rear behind them

INT SALOON - CONTINUOUS

Rufus sits at a table in the empty saloon watching the crowd
gather outside Trudy Smith walks in-

RUFUS BUCK
Howd I look

TRUDY
Alright

RUFUS BUCK

Everybody out there

TRUDY
Just about

Trudy stands before Rufus

TRUDY (CONTD)
How could you do it

Rufus turns slightly as Trudy steps up beside him

TRUDY (CONTD)
How could you trust all of this to

Wiley
Rufus takes a beat

RUFUS BUCK
If you were running Redwood who
wouldve kept our operation goin’
Who woulda kept all the other gangs
in line Look I know that Wiley
got his ways but he was loyal
once

Trudy takes that in then—

TRUDY
Loyalty is a virtue Rufus Until
it ain’t

RUFUS BUCK

Are you loyal to me

Trudy almost takes offense

TRUDY
See these folk here either can’t
see it or don’t want to but I
believe in what you’re doing This
place can be the promised land for
us Long as that’s so ain’t
nothing I won’t do to see it
through

Rufus looks at the crowd gathering outside then walks close
to Trudy

RUFUS BUCK
You tell them

He puts his head against hers-
EXT STREET OUTSIDE THE SALOON - MOMENTS LATER
Trudy steps out in front of the crowd and calls out—

TRUDY
Citizens of Redwood -- A new day is
dawning As by now you have
doubtless learned the territory is
being officially opened up for
settlement They say what we own
is goin’ stay our own But you
know as well as I do what that’s
worth Your land your businesses
your homes have all been promised
to the highest bidders by your one
time sheriff Wiley Escoe

Murmurs from the crowd Cherokee Bill steps forward—

CHEROKEE BILL
Mr Buck can prevent that from
happening But in order to do so it
will be necessary for us levy a
tax to be deposited in the Redwood
bank by noon Friday

Full on murmurs in the crowd A FARMER stands—

FARMER
At what cost to us

TRUDY
Fifty thousand dollars

A COLLECTIVE GASP Shouts of protest A BUSINESSMAN

BUSINESSMAN
You could scrape every penny from
every living soul in this town and
it wouldn’t come near to that

JAMES— A YOUNG SHOPKEEPER- speaks out-—

JAMES
You got us between a rock and hard
place Ms Smith—

TRUDY
How long you been alive in this
country A rock and a hard place is
what we call Monday

stands—

JAMES

I heard of Rufus Buck How bad a
man he is But he got himself
thrown in jail before and I reckon
he’1ll be there again soon enough

(puts on his hat)
-- when he is maybe I’11l come back
to this town Because I ain’t
paying shit

He turns to leave but—
Rufus exits the saloon- the crowd take him in

RUFUS BUCK
You think I made redwood for
myself To what end Redwood ain’t
a hiding place ‘cause I don’t hide
It ain’t a dream I don’t dream
You know what it is It’s an
example for others to follow And
Youyou are enemies of
progress

He walks and stands right in front of James- Every citizens
blood freezes James starts to shake in fear and opens his
hands to show he’s unarmed

JAMES
Please I got a family

RUFUS BUCK
What’s your name

JAMES
James

Rufus draws his pistol and BANG SHOOTS James in the heart
sending him crashing to the floor in a heap

RUFUS BUCK
Rest in peace James

RUFUS WALKS THROUGH THE CROWD AND THEY PART LIKE THE RED SEA

UNTIL HE IS STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE BUSINESSMAN WHO
SPOKE THE MAN SWEATS RUFUS SPEAKS SOFTLY—

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
Now How much

The man is confused afraid to answer

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
How much can be gathered
BUSINESSMAN
Ten thousand Maybe fifteen if

every last cent is squeezed

Rufus stays there a moment then continues on toward the
Mayors Mansion

RUFUS BUCK
Ain’t nobody leave town until we
collect it all
TRUDY SMITH

Steps forward and calls out startling the crowd again—

TRUDY
And if you fail to comply you and
everything you love will burn
EXT FOREST - DAY
WILEY ESCOE -- Beaten and bruised barely able to stay in his

saddle rides his horse amongst the trees

CLICK From off the side Wiley halts and puts his hands
high

WILEY ESCOE
I have nothing to rob

Bill Pickett emerges from the shadow of the trees gun aimed—
PICKETT
But I got somebody to shoot Step
down
Wiley dismounts Pickett WHISTLES- Cuffee steps out from the
trees on the other side of Wiley holstering a pistol Pats

him down quickly and efficiently

BASS REEVES (0S)
Wiley Escoe

Wiley stops as he sees Bass Reeves stepping out of the
shadows

He sags with exhaustion And fear

WILEY ESCOE
Bass Reeves Fuck

EXT WOODS - LATER

Nat Love paces angrily near Wiley - who sits on the ground
front of him

WIDER The rest of the gang is sat around the campfire -
except Reeves - who stands nursing the burning pot

WILEY ESCOE
Redwood is crawling with gunmen
Rufus came with twelve Took six of
mine Who knows how many he got by
now

BECKWOURTH
I don’t believe a word this man
saying He’s a scout I say we kill
him And we take the rest of them
teeth

Beckwourth draws his pistol quick

WILEY ESCOE
You ever shot a sheriff boy A
mayor Little harder than shooting
regular folk And I’m both

BASS REEVES (0S)
You both alive and dead ‘cause
Rufus don’t like loose ends

The others turn to Reeves who takes out his pipe and keeps
his eyes on Wiley—

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
Law don’t find a man like Rufus
Buck unless you got inside
information Ain’t that right
Wiley If I had my way you’d be
right up under the jail next to
Rufus But you cut yourself a
deal and wound up wearing a badge
instead

WILEY ESCOE
You got your reasons you want Rufus
gone and I got mine Ain’t the
enemy of my enemy my friend Rufus
tryin’ to save Redwood But for
that he need money And that’s one
thing he ain’t have

Wiley tenses Nat glares at him-

NAT
All right Look here You made a
deal with the Devil Now he come to
collect You rest up but be gone
by sun up or it’s gonna get go
from bad to badder You hear

EXT CAMP - CLOSE ON CAMPFIRE

Flames filling the screen RACK to a shining GUN spinning
then being placed back in a holster—

WIDER SHOWS The gang gathered around the campfire We
don’t see Mary and Wiley yet Beckwourth draws his gun again
lightning fast puts it back in his holster draws again and
proceeds with gun tricks He is impressive

BASS REEVES
All them tricks’1l get you killed

BECKWOURTH
Listen Marshal I’m faster than any

Beckwourth smiles

CUFFEE

PICKETT
Negro said in the mirror

Laughter from Pickett and Beckwourth
CUFFEE
I rather ride into a battle with a

dark horse over a golden stallion

BECKWOURTH
Huh What that mean

CUFFEE
Shiny shit get shot

Nat looks across the flames to where Mary is tending to some
of Wiley Escoe’s wounds short distance away Clearly unhappy
she’s doing it She looks up and makes eye-contact with Nat—

BECKWOURTH
What you think about that lawman

BASS REEVES
I think you’re all going to die

Mary breaks her defiant eye-contact with Nat -- then leaves
Wiley and walks away from the camp into the shadow of the
trees

EXT EDGE OF THE FOREST - SUNSET

Mary stands at the edge of a rise gazing out at the darkening
valley below where the town of REDWOOD is visible A voice on
the soundtrack sings-

“Away with the wind she goes And away with the wind she
goes”

Nat walks up behind Mary and -

NAT
(singing softly)
As her garden grows hold those
flowers close for away with the
wind she goes

Steps closer to Mary - She speaks in the most unwavering
manner-

MARY
I’1l be back with information by
sun up

NAT

Information from where

MARY
Redwood You know we can’t trust
Wiley’s word Someone’s got to go
in there and get the lay of the
land before we make our next move

NAT
Yeah Mary but that someone ain’t

MARY
Every gun-hand in the territorys

get hop off your horse Same with
Bill and Beckwourth

NAT
—In case you forgot your face is
more famous than the rest of ours

it up on advertisements for that
saloon of yours from here to
Texas

MARY
Which is why I can ride into town
in plain sight Everyone knows I’m
buying saloons Rufus needs money
I’ma make him an offer on Trudy
Smith’s place--

NAT
Mary what in my character makes
you think I’11 allow that

MARY
I’m not asking for your
permission

Nat hesitates Takes a deep breath and reaches into his
pocket—

NAT
Then I I guess I’1l just be
asking you for yours Since you’1l
never let a man give you away I
just have to ask you direct—

Nat holds out the WEDDING BAND

NAT (CONTD)
It’s the ring my father gave my
mother

Mary’s eyes glitter but she gives no response
NAT (CONTD)
I was gonna give it to you back in

Douglas

MARY
But you didn’t

NAT
I am now
Mary takes a moment then she steps close to Nat—
MARY
I used to hate feeling helpless
over you Those days are over Nat
When the dust settles we gonna go
our separate ways for good but
not until the dust settles I’m
here till then
No answer

Mary closes Nat’s hand over the ring—

Nat absorbs the weight of the moment— taking in the woman he
loves Then—

MARY (CONTD)
See ya sun up

Mary walks off

EXT REDWOOD MAIN STREET - NIGHT

The street is ALIVE Though the townsfolk are well behaved
WHORES still holla at men from the balcony of the saloon and
JOHNS and GAMBLERS are aplenty Then

“BLACK WOMAN” BY THE BULLITTS RINGS ON THE SOUNDTRACK as-

Stagecoach Mary rides her horse into frame- and stops at the
top of the street She looks around-

And begins to ride slowly down enemy territory

She takes in Main Street- making mental notes of her
surroundings particularly Rufus Buck’s ARMED HENCHMEN they
stand outside the hotels the bank and on the roofs of
various buildings

Mary stops outside of a hotel and dismounts when ANGEL steps
into her way

ANGEL
You a resident of Redwood ma’am

Angel puts his hand on his gun Mary doesn’t flinch-

MARY
You don’t own a gun confident
enough to ask where I reside

ANGEL
This gun says answer the damn
question

Mary whips around the SHOTGUN that was in her saddle-holster—

CLACK

MARY
This gun don’t talk

- CLACK Hammers pulled back Mary turns to see TWO

GUNMEN leveling weapons at her Then they part as TRUDY
SMITH steps through—

TRUDY
Stagecoach Mary

MARY
Ghastly Gertrude Smith

TRUDY
I prefer Treacherous Trudy myself
but Ill take it What brings you
to my town

MARY
I heard Rufus Buck was back

TRUDY
News travels fast

MARY
Got an offer he’1ll want to hear
about

TRUDY
Any offer you got you can make to
me

MARY

I don’t do business with the help

Trudy’s eyes glare but she forces a smile Reaches her

hand out

TRUDY
Gimme tha shit

Mary flips the shotgun up Holds it there then hands it

Trudy

to

MARY
Lead the way Treacherous Trudy

INT TRUDY’S SALOON - MOMENTS LATER
THIS PLACE IS STUNNING - THE DECOR - THE MUSIC - THE LADIES
OF THE NIGHT - THIS SALOON IS A WORLD ONTO ITSELF

Mary is led into the stunning establishment by Angel and
followed by Trudy who is holding Mary’s shotgun over her own
shoulder

Mary is impressed but tries to conceal any sign of it as-

A LADY painted entirely in BLUE clothed only with jewelry
around her chest and waist area - seemingly comes out of
nowhere and dances hypnotically

The Blue Lady moves backwards as if leading Mary Trudy and
Angel through the saloon She disappears by the BAND
PERFORMING revealing a MAN sitting inside a golden arc at
the back of the room-

RUFUS BUCK

Is sitting alone at a table in a golden arc at the back
watching the band play Mary sees him- her shock and fear is
visibly evident

Cherokee Bill sits at the bar He notices Mary and puts his
drink down

Trudy speaks a few words to Rufus Then she looks over and
nods and

Angel steps aside Mary approaches the table trying to hide
her fear and then she is there Rufus stays as he is for a
moment then turns and faces Mary Mary displays confidence

TRUDY
Speak your piece

Mary does her best to meet Rufus’s gaze

MARY
I assume you know who I am I
assume you know who I used to run
with Those days are over for me
anyhow but I didn’t get to be
Stagecoach Mary Fields without
having my ears to the ground

(MORE )

MARY (CONTD)
and my ears tell me you just lost
twenty-five thou that was coming
your way

Lamplight glitters in Rufus’s eyes Rufus says nothing but
Trudy

TRUDY
I’m hoping your proposal rivals
your nerve-

MARY
-Allow me the latitude of
completion

Trudy is almost taken aback at the quip -- Cherokee Bill
walks over from the bar and stands at the other side of Mary

Standing between Trudy and Cherokee Mary tries to display
confidence

MARY (CONTD)
My saloon in Douglas is booming
Bought me another one in Elks and I
got a restaurant in Cascade too
For the sum of all that I’1ll take
this one off your hands The mere
mention of my name brings forth
good business to any establishment
attached whereas with all due
respect the name Rufus Buck
instils fear

Rufus Buck regards Mary with his blazing eyes

RUFUS BUCK
We know who you are You walk into
my town with that proposal is
risky The kind of risk a woman
such as yourself wouldn’t tie
herself to‘less there was a
whole of a lot more at stake

Mary keeps it together—

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
See I don’t believe in
coincidences like you just gonna
walk in here right after the
Crimson Hoods get ambushed with my
money What are you thinking

CLOSE ON RUFUS BUCK Glaring at Mary He looks at Trudy
and doesn’t even have to gesture

Mary sees this and defiantly almost smiles
Trudy swings the butt of her shotgun into Mary’s face— WHACK

TRUDY
You musta forgotten whose name is
on the door
(to the bar)
Another round We havin’ a party
yall Come on

EXT RIDGE - LATE MORNING

The sun is already beating down on the valley Nat Love
stands on the ridge looking down into the distance with
concern There is no one approaching anywhere within eye-
shot

NAT
All right Mary All right

INT JAILHOUSE - NOON
CAMERA ON Trudy’s hands as it slowly cores an apple

TRUDY
So you still sayin’ you don’t know
nothin’ about that money and you
done come here alone

Mary tied up in the chair grins

MARY
That’s right

TRUDY
You done rode all the way over here
to get yourself killed And for
what
-- For love

MARY
Love is the only thing worth dying
for But you wouldn’t know
anything about that

Trudy pauses her gaze on Mary She swings over a chair in
front of her

TRUDY
You know I had a sister named
Mary

(MORE )
TRUDY (CONTD)
She was pretty and strong-willed-
like you She died of polio when I
was eleven Always in pain but
would never let me see her cry
There was a girl called Hope Lived
by us Big fat kid Always picking
on the smaller kids obviously out
of jealousy Ain’t never fuck with
me though She hated Mary with a
passion Always teasing her about
how thin and frail she was Then
one day Hope walkin’ past our
house with an apple in one hand and
a blade in the other She decided
to throw the apple across the
street at Mary and it hit my
sister in the head and knocked her
out of balance She fell down the
steps Broke her ankle That was
the first and only time I
physically saw my sister cry And
the was Hope standing there
laughin’ her ugly fuckin’ face off
My daddy he got home he took
off his belt and he beat me for
not protecting my sister He lashed
me until my whole body went numb
Then he went to Hope’s house to do
the same to her But when he got
there he saw her entire family at
the side of their house all of
them crying and screaming and
there was Hope lying on the floor
in a pool of blood Somebody had
slit her throat Killed her with
her own knife Daddy was
speechless He ain’t said a word to
me when he came home The next day
he sent me to live with my
grandparents And the next time I
seen my sister she was laying ina
coffin Disease had killed her

Mary absorbs Trudy’s story

MARY
I am sorry your sister had to
suffer I admire her bravery
Truly But you get no words from
me

Only the core of the apple remains in Trudy’s hand

TRUDY
Your know I actually admire your
bravery But I’m afraid the outcome
is still the outcome H

Trudy carefully slides her knife upon Mary’s neck

TRUDY (CONTD)
Hope must die

One of Trudy’s Gunmen puts a rope around Mary’s neck and
begins STRANGLING her Mary can’t breathe She is just about
to lose consciousness and as Trudy signals -

TRUDY (CONTD)
But not yet

EXT REDWOOD MAIN STREET - NIGHT

Mary hits the dirt face-first Trudy Smith stands over her
Angel pulls the bruised Mary to her feet TWO GUNMEN stand
behind them - Other Gunmen on the roofs and balconies of Main
Street looking menacingly at the citizens around them Trudy
turns to Angel

TRUDY
Leave her out here in the street so
everyone can see her No one comes
to collect her before sunup put a
bullet in her head

ANGEL
Looks like we’re not gonna have to
wait that long

Trudy turns in the direction Angel is looking As do all the
others

FIVE RIDERS

Are approaching from the outskirts of town Gunmen on
rooftops porches and from the street all prepare their
weapons

Cherokee Bill who has been watching from the side detaches
himself from the post he was leaning and joins Trudy in the
middle of the street as

The five riders reach the edge of the town Nat Love Bass
Reeves and Beckwourth in the front Cuffee and Pickett right
behind them As they approach

Pickett slides off his horse keeping close behind it and
drawing his rifle with one smooth motion he sidles to the
cover provided by the wooden pillar in front of a nearby
shop He levels the rifle immediately at Trudy far down the
street

Nat dismounts a short distance away and the others follow
Cuffee takes the horses’ reins and leads them to a post
keeping a hand on a pistol and staying behind the horses for
cover

Nat Love and Bass Reeves walk into the middle of the street
and face Trudy and Cherokee Bill Beckwourth leans on the
post outside the bank He looks at Nat-

BECKWOURTH
Whoever die first

NAT
Whoever die first

BASS REEVES
What kinda dumb saying is that You
two trying to get shot

Nat steps forward and he and Mary lock eyes

TRUDY
Nat Love How predictable

NAT
You predict my friend Bill Pickett
aiming at your bowler cap

Guns turn toward the distance They can’t even see Pickett

NAT (CONTD)
You’1l be dead before your men find
their aim

TRUDY
And you die right after

NAT
But your boss won’t see one red
cent of that money Where is he

TRUDY
Where is who

NAT
(sternly)
Where is Rufus Buck

Trudy wasn’t expecting that She walks toward Nat Mary
shakes her head at Nat as if- ‘Not yet

Trudy makes eye contact with Bass Reeves - they know of each
other well

TRUDY
(sarcastically)
Bass If I knew you were switching
sides I’d ask you to come join us

Reeves - with an ice cold menace-

Trudy is unfazed She steps right in front of Nat Love - and
speaks calmly-

TRUDY (CONTD)
Ain’t you here for your damsel in
distress

NAT
You don’t look hard of hearing So
Ima ask you again Where is Rufus
Buck

Trudy smiles She realizes there is another story behind this
man

TRUDY
Well clearly you don’t know me
Tell your men to go But you stay
Maybe your damsel might live a
longer

Nat is ready to kill everything Mary remains level headed
through the entire standoff - She looks at Nat and calms him -
Nat moves his hand away from his gun

Trudy nods to Angel He signals the Gunmen in Redwood- they
all lower their guns

NAT
Marshal

Bass Reeves raises his hand - Pickett immediately lowers his
rifle

TRUDY
Aww You’re pretty though Ah take
her ass back in there

Trudy turns around and heads to the jail The Gunmen behind
Mary lead her back to the jail after Trudy Angel remains
staring at Nat

Cherokee turns toward the saloon then loud enough for all
to hear-

BECKWOURTH
Ay That the quick draw I hear
tell about Cherokee Bill

Beckwourth takes several steps forward and stops

THE INSTRUMENTAL OF “DO YOUR THING” BY ISAAC HAYES RINGS ON
THE SOUNDTRACK

Every eye is on Beckwourth and Cherokee Nat can’t believe
what he’s seeing—

Cherokee stops a few paces before Beckwourth

BECKWOURTH (CONTD)
I hear you so fast that your
opponents ain’t got time to draw
before you put two in they back

CHEROKEE BILL
Nah that ain’t me I’m the
Cherokee Bill that shoots men in
the mouth that talk too much

BECKWOURTH
I’1l make it easy for you You draw
first

CHEROKEE BILL
That what you think this is “Who
the quickest draw in the West”

BECKWOURTH
All comes down to who fast and who
ain’t right

CHEROKEE BILL
No It all comes down to who’s
alive and who’s dead
(to Trudy)
Trudy I’m gonna get me something
to drink Goodnight

The remaining men on the street are glued to the two
Cherokee pauses then

Cherokee turns his back on Beckwourth and walks into the
saloon

BECKWOURTH (CONTD)
Hey Hey drink my ass I practiced
that standoff all night

Nat turns to Beckwourth and glares at him keeping his temper
in check

NAT

Jim
Beckwourth is pumped with adrenaline but he keeps it
together and turns and walks back toward Bass Reeves and
Cuffee and the horses
ON NAT’S GANG
Beckwourth swings up onto his horse and joins Reeves and
Cuffee as they ride back out of town under the gaze of the

gunmen on the rooftops and all around them

Bill Pickett steps out of cover reluctantly gets onto his
horse and joins the gang They all look at Nat

Nat Love stands alone in the street - He nods confidently to
his men as if “Not yet”

Angel comes up behind him and grabs Nat’s hands pulling them
behind his back Nat smiles This is war

INT JAILHOUSE - LATER

Nat dangles by his wrists from a rope on the other side of
the bars Trudy Smith watches with amusement as Angel PUNCHES
Nat repeatedly in the gut About to hit the face but—

TRUDY
That’s enough

Angel delivers another body shot Trudy turns and leaves the
room let out by Angel who stands right outside the door

Nat talks to Mary behind him-

NAT
They beat you bad

Mary’s Silence speaks volumes
Nat’s eyes turn red with rage

NAT (CONTD)
I’1l kill them all

Then-

The jailhouse door opens -- Nat is too worn to turn and look
-- A figure enters the dim space whistling Walking toward
Nat-

Rufus Buck stands face to face with Nat Takes a long stare
at Nat’s scar Then

RUFUS BUCK
You familiar with Napoleon

Nat just glares at Rufus

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)

He said “I driven towards an end
that I do not know As I reach it
as I shall become unnecessary an
atom shall suffice to shatter me
Until then all forces of humankind
can do nothing to stop me” As a
man he knew exactly who he was
Most importantly he knew that his
time would come to an end Cut him
down

Rufus nods at Angel who steps forward and cuts him down Nat
tries to stay standing but drops down to his knees and

Something falls out of his shirt pocket CLINKS on the
floor

Rufus looks down and sees THE WEDDING BAND He bends down and
picks it up turns it in his fingers Looks at Mary across
the bars and stands over Nat—

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
Do you know why I gave you that
scar

Nat’s eyes gleam with hate—

NAT
So I would remember you

RUFUS BUCK
No I gave you that scar so I can
know your face when you come back
to me

Rufus slips the ring into his own jacket pocket

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
Nat Love The outlaw who robs
outlaws The angel of death who
hunts down those who trespass
against him with no mercy I know
who you are
And I see the line that you won’t
cross See I know what’s on the
other side

Rufus motions to Angel who pulls Nat up and puts him into a
chair Rufus turns away from Nat

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
Apologize for the beating It was
more of an indication for what Ms
Fields might see if we fail to come
to terms

NAT
What terms

RUFUS BUCK

You will return the money you
stole from me by Friday noon Not
a moment later And you will add
ten thousand dollars on top of
that We’ll call that interest
(Pause)

Somethin’ funny

NAT
Ooh shit How you reckon I’ma get
that
Rufus turns to Nat
RUFUS BUCK

You’re gonna rob a bank Nat Love
is gonna rob a bank

Rufus lets that sink in

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
In the meantime here’s a little
token of my appreciation in
advance

He takes a small WOODEN BOX from his coat pocket and throws
it at Nat

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
Go ‘head open it

Nat inspects the box - it’s an old STRAIGHT RAZOR

Nat’s eyes fill with fury his body almost trembles but
keeps it together

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
I expect my money on Friday All
off it

Rufus Exits

EXT FOREST CLEARING - DAY
CLOSE ON NAT rolling the wooden box in his hands

BASS REEVES (0OS)
You know I can’t let you do that

NAT
If that money ain’t in Rufus’ hands

PICKETT
What bank are we talking about

NAT

PICKETT
Maysville— That’s a white town

NAT
Yeah which is why they gonna have
ten thousand dollars in their bank

PICKETT
It’s crazy

BECKWOURTH
My emotions are all types of
confused I mean Pickett I agree
That’s crazy But Nat I also agree

that we gonna do that shit anyways
That’s some true outlaw shit We
outlaws ain’t we--

NAT
—Ain’t no “we” Jim Not after that

us all killed

Beckwourth bites back his bile at the admonishment

BECKWOURTH
I had that

NAT
You go fetch that money you took
from the Crimson Hoods Pickett

Beckwourth gives Nat an “are you serious” look which Nat
ignores

CUFFEE
If Rufus Buck wants that bank took
why don’t he send his own men

NAT
This way he’s clean I gotta go in
barefaced as day a freshly-minted
bank robber face up on wanted
posters all over the territory—

BASS REEVES
They’1l be on you like flies on
shit before you knock on the door

NAT
Yep I said “I” had to be
recognized

Nat reaches into the saddle-bag on his horse pulls out a
bundle and throws it to Cuffee who catches it Unfurls it
revealing a LONG PUFFY RED DRESS Cuffee’s expression sinks

CUFFEE
Oh hell no

NAT
(to Cuffee)
For Mary

Cuffee hesitates then reaches down and unbuttons her jeans—

Nat turns around out of respect Beckwourth lets out a
relieved sigh

BECKWOURTH
Close fuckin’ shave I thought I
was falling for a fella fora
little bit That’s why I didn’t say
nothing
(to Pickett)
(MORE)

BECKWOURTH (CONTD)
Did you feel it too You felt it

EXT MAYSVILLE - AFTERNOON

Nat and Cuffee closely followed by Pickett ride toward the
town’s main street

Tile
MAYSVILLE (It’s a white town)

Cuffee is in the red dress a red bonnet on her head riding
side-saddle barely able to stay on her horse’s back She
reaches up to fix her hat from falling over her eyes and
almost slides off her horse

A MOMENT LATER

They stop at a hitching post near the BANK WHITE TOWNSFOLK
watching them closely Nat dismounts first— reaches a hand
to Cuffee Cuffee takes it and slides off her saddle Her
ankles buckle in her high-heels and she almost falls Nat
keeps her up He then takes the reins from her hand and
gives them to

Pickett who leads the horses to a water trough across the
street keeping his collar turned up to cover his face

Nat reaches his arm out to Cuffee like a gentleman—

NAT (CONTD)
Allow me

ANOTHER MOMENT LATER

Nat and Cuffee walk side by side down the gangplanks Cuffee
trips but Nat catches her

NAT (CONTD)
What’s your real name

CUFFEE
Cuffee my real name Name I was
born with is Cathay Williams

NAT
You walk even worse’n you ride
(sarcastically)
Cathay

Nat smiles at a passing group of WHITE PEOPLE

CUFFEE
Mr Love my momma always told me
to respect my elders so I’m not
gonna say what I’m thinking

NAT
That’s all right I can read your
mind

CUFFEE
Then I’m sorry you had to hear
that

They stop outside the bank doors Nat takes a beat and
inhales Looks at Cuffee—

INT BANK - CONTINUOUS

Nat and Cuffee enter the bank EVERYONE STOPS IN THEIR
TRACKS - CUSTOMERS - THREE FEMALE TELLERS - TWO GUARDS ALL
STARING AT NAT AND CUFFEE

Cuffee walks toward the CLERKS WINDOW trips catches
herself and holding up her skirt continues on while

Nat stays back scopes out the space The TWO TELLERS at
their windows each have a CUSTOMER A BANK MANAGER was
assisting an ELDERLY COUPLE at the time of entry and-

-TWO BANK GUARDS -- one by the door the other by the
counter not sensing danger just frozen in wonderment

Cuffee manages to arrive in front of the open teller’s window
with no further incident

TELLER
Yes

CUFFEE
Id like to make a withdrawal

The Teller grins- Then sniggers- Then bursts into laughter
She looks at the two other tellers who start laughing She
finally collects herself—

TELLER
You have to have an account ma’am
And well I’d recommend a bank
in Jericho or even Redwood for
that

CUFFEE
Oh I’m not talking about that
kinda withdrawal ma’am

Cuffee pulls up her dress and awkwardly reaches under it
fishing around for something having trouble finding it

Every eye in the bank is on her fascinated and appalled

CUFFEE (CONTD)
I’m talking I’m talking about

Nat’s nerves are nearly jumping out of his skin as Cuffee
struggles under her dress for another moment and finally

-- Pulls out a SIXGUN and points it at the Teller

CUFFEE (CONTD)
-- That kind

The GUARDS near Nat reach for their gun but— WHAM— Nat
smashes one in the face with the butt of his own pistol
knocking the man cold then

Suddenly a BIG MALE CUSTOMER charges up behind Cuffee- He
grabs her arm causing her to drop her gun and neck-locks
her lifting her off her feet

Nat swiftly draws another gun and levels it at the Customer
He grits his teeth very unwilling to pull the trigger

This has gone sideways with the quickness

WHACK Cuffee ELBOWS the Customer in the ribs then PUNCHES
him in the side of the head He falls back letting her go
Cuffee turns around in a fury and WHACK Knocks the
Customer out cold on the teller window counter

Nat levels his gun at the SECOND GUARD across the room who
aims his gun right back clearly frightened Nat speaks
evenly—

NAT
Hey blue eyes You’re scared Your
hand is shaking You’1ll miss I
won’t Exhale

It is a tense face-off The Guard doesn’t know what to do He
looks at both Nat and Cuffee

The Guard places his gun on the floor and slides it over to
Nat Cuffee holds her gun level at the teller

CUFFEE
I ain’t like my partner He don’t
wanna shoot nobody But all of a
sudden I’m of a mind to Now open
that fuckin’ gate

The Teller gets up and opens the gate Cuffee steps through
-- Cuffee pushes the pistol against the Teller’s head

CUFFEE (CONTD)
Think I’m funny now

Cuffee then turns to the Bank Manager who has remained calm
throughout

CUFFEE (CONTD)
What you lookin’ at Get all the
customers over there

The Manager urges the Customers to the corner of the room

CUFFEE (CONTD)
(to the Guard)
Get ‘em over there

The guard joins the others

NAT
Times have changedain’t they

Nat reaches down and drags the unconscious guard to the
counter

NAT (CONTD)
They say robbing banks is hard
work But that’s a lie Robbing
banks is easy— the hard part is
doing it without killing

Nat lowers his gun and offers his hand to the Bank Manager—

NAT (CONTD)
What’1ll it be Mr Manager

The bank manager gladly shakes it

NAT (CONTD)
Good man

EXT BANK - MORNING

Nat exits the bank followed by the Manager who is holding
TWO SATCHELS He is followed by Cuffee staying close to the
Manager covering the gun pointing at his back with a lady’s
PURSE They smile at a few SUSPICIOUS PASSERS-BY as they
walk across the street

Nat grabs the SATCHELS from the Bank Manager and throws them
over the backs of the horses as the townspeople in the street
freeze

Nat gives a last look at the Manager—
NAT
(to the manager)

He swings up onto his horse and he and Cuffee take off on
their mounts

Pickett slaps his horse and jumps onto it on the run
catching up with Nat and Cuffee - the three of them take off

ANGEL steps up to Reeves as he pulls the harness off the
horse

BASS REEVES
Afternoon I would ask you to run
go fetch your superior
-- But that’d be like asking you to
fetch your daddy It could be
anyone right

ANGEL
You know I’m willing to bet my
right arm I got a higher body count
than yours

BASS REEVES
That’d be a bad bet son

CHEROKEE BILL (0S)
I fancy that song or whatever it
was you was whistling there

Angel WHISTLES back to a Gunman outside the saloon- The
Gunman opens the door of the saloon- Cherokee Bill walks out

Reeves gives the horse a smack on the rear - it trots away
down the street Cherokee Bill strides over to Reeves

CHEROKEE BILL (CONTD)

Reeves starts walking away from the wagon

BASS REEVES
Walk with me

Cherokee Bill follows him hand on his gun
BILL PICKETT

Now on the roof sees a GUNMAN in front of him looking down
onto the street Pickett sneaks behind him and - WHAM Knocks
the Gunman unconscious He drags the man to the side and
quickly ducks down as-

CARSON

Perched on the roof of the Mayor’s Mansion his RIFLE in hand
-- with an almost sixth sense tears his gaze from the street
and looks up toward Trudy’s saloon - No one is there

BASS REEVES (CONTD)
You know they call your boss the
Devil himself But even the devil
need his money So being as we are
in possession of that money let
me dictate the terms of engagement—

KABOOOOOOOOO00OM -- THE WAGON BLOWS UP in a TREMENDOUS
EXPLOSION behind them Angel is blown to pieces

Gunmen and citizens alike hit the deck

Even Cherokee Bill is shocked as one of the Gunman’s arms
crashes at his feet

CHEROKEE BILL
What the fuck was that old man

BASS REEVES
Is that the right arm or the left
Oh yeah that Yeah now there’s
us and there’s y’all

Behind Nat comes CUFFEE- perched atop Wiley’s wagon the back
of which THE SATCHELS OF MONEY are sitting strapped to a BIG
STACK OF EXPOSED DYNAMITE -- She holds a pistol- directly
aimed at the DYNAMITE

BASS REEVES AND CHEROKEE BILL

Watch as Nat and Cuffee approach -- They reach the center of
Main Street and stop there

EXT REDWOOD MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

with the gun pointed at the pile of satchels and dynamite

Cherokee carefully flips open the satchels sees they are
stuffed with GREEN BILLS

Nat shakes his head—

NAT
Now or your boss is gonna be one
quick draw and thirty-five thousand
dollars short

Cuffee cocks the hammer of the pistol Cherokee Bill bites it
back again He turns toward the JAILHOUSE and gives a sharp
whistle—

THE JAILHOUSE DOOR opens and MARY is led out into the
street by TRUDY SMITH and TWO GUARDS One Guard has a PISTOL
aimed at Mary
Mary makes emotional eye-contact with Nat and
Nat tears his eyes from Mary and looks up to Rufus
NAT (CONTD)
All right Unhitch this horse so’s

Mary can ride out

Cherokee Bill gives Nat a venomous stare but does as he says
and de-rigs the horse

NAT (CONTD)
You always move so slow

CHEROKEE BILL
You always talk so much

Nat takes the reins of the horse Cuffee moves back to the
other side of the street

Nat leads the horse down the street toward Mary leaving
Cherokee Bill standing by the pile of money

Then-

Cherokee can’t take it anymore He pulls out his gun in order
to shoot Nat

Nat doesn’t even turn around
NAT

BECKWOURTH

doesn’t pay them any mind Cherokee lowers his gun

BECKWOURTH (CONTD)

Gunmen holding Mary—

TRUDY

“Youre dead in your blood”

It blows a nearby GUNMAN right through a store window

Nat lets the horse go drawing his guns as he hits the
ground

“That’s your woman Ain’t no better love”

MORE BULLETS hit the roof around Pickett and he backs away
gasping in pain as he falls over the rails of the roof onto a
balcony He lands clumsily and has to duck as more BULLETS
hit around him fired by

A GUNMAN ON A NEARBY BALCONY It looks bad for Pickett -- but
BULLETS EXPLODE through the planks beneath the GUNMAN’s feet
hitting him in the legs and groin

They fire at the Gunmen who are lining up in front of the
Mayor’s Mansion and forming a veritable firing squad

forcing Nat and Reeves to take cover behind a nearby wagon

CHEROKEE BILL standing behind him gun out Cherokee looks
puzzled as Pickett gasps for air-

CHEROKEE BILL

Pickett’s bludgeoned hands away

CHEROKEE BILL (CONTD)
Don’t do that You had a choice
You always got a choice

The dying Pickett is wheezing while bloodying Cherokee’s
jacket Cherokee moves Pickett’s hand away and places his own
arm kindly on his enemy’s shoulder

Pick up your guns

Rufus makes no move to do so He just finishes his drink

NAT
Pick ‘em up I say

Rufus puts the glass down

RUFUS BUCK
Your father

Nat’s blood runs cold

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
He was a good man

NAT
He was And my mother was a good
woman Before you cut ‘em down

RUFUS BUCK
Seems we had a different upbringing

NAT
I don’t care how you was raised
Now Pick up your guns and turn
around

RUFUS BUCK
I used to watch my father beat my
mother to a pulp if she overcooked
his food He cut her up real good
if undercooked it too

(turns slightly)

One day I decided to intervene
and he turned his wrath on me My
father was not a good man Not a
good man He was an outlaw Robbin’
banks He liked to drink My
mother took a bottle and cut him to
protect me He lashed back at her
and just like that she was gone
Then like the coward he is he
took everything we had and left
leaving me with mymy mother I
was ten years old you know about
the same age you was when I gave
you that scar I had to fend for
myself but I became who I am just
like you

(MORE )

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
As I did all I could ever think
about is wanting my father to pay
for what he did I searched for
him for years and years and I could
never find him It’s like he had
disappeared off the face of the
earth I ain’t stop though I kept
looking until I did find him One
day lo and behold there he was
my father

Rufus stands up

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
A new man he was clean now Sober
Man of God At church He had a
pretty little wife And he had a
son about the age of ten years
old whose eyes blazed like mine

BACK TO NAT

Overwhelmed with shock and horror tears fall from Nat’s
eyes His gun hand trembles

NAT
Youre lying

Rufus stares into his eyes—

RUFUS BUCK
Killing our father was retribution
but--

NAT

My Father My Mother

RUFUS BUCK
But it wasn’t enough Letting you
live that was true revenge Every
sin you mad every bank you robbed

at you You everything he tried to
run away from Buck Changed his
name to “Love” You a Buck Just
like me Just like him But you
better You gonna surpass even me
because I could not kill my
brother I couldn’t kill my

kill yours

Nat is torn asunder with the revelation Rufus lets it

fester

RUFUS BUCK (CONTD)
