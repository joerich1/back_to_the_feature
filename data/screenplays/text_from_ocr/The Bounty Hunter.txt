desk Filing cabinets spitting up papers A man SID (wound
sorta tight Milos best friend) peers down at us

SID
Youre drooling on my sofa

Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch wobbles
upright Are the walls throbbing or is it just him

SID
You do have an apartment dont
you With a bed of some kind

Milo grunts Sid hands him a coffee

SID
Heard you shut down 5th Street
yesterday Gave every kid in the
county the gift of nightmares

MILO
Hey Ima giving kind of guy
Anyway what do you care I brought
your guy in right

Milo holds out his hand palm up Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS
PALM

EXT SIDS BAIL BONDSJERSEY CITY- MORNING

Swearing under his breath Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas
tree

into the back of a station wagon At least half of the tree

is hanging out of the back Milo drinks a beer and watches

SID
You gonna give me a hand or just
stand there killing your liver

MILO
Is that a trick question

Sid glares at him Milo sighs puts down his beer and grabs
part of the tree

SID
So I told her fine Id handle
Xmas this year I mean whats to
handle You buy a tree some gifts
cook a ham hang some lights An
idiot could do it

MILO
Well well soon find out
Sid checks him out

SID
You have plans for the holiday

MILO
The usual

SID
Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and
put your fist through a wall

MILO
Jealous

The tree is definitely not going to fit They let it go and
Sid pulls out a small hand saw

SID
Then forget it

MILO
Forget what

SID
Ive got an open bond but your
thing sounds like more fun Ill
give it to Doug instead

Sid starts hacking away at the tree

MILO
Whoa Hold up Heidi What the
fuck I want the job Im in the
hole

SID
Youre always in the hole

MILO
Whats your point

SID
(SIGHING)
The truth is Im not sure youre
the right person for this job It
could be a total disaster On the
other hand when one friend sees
another friend stagnating in his
own filth he has to do something

right

MILO
Hey I just woke up I was gonna
shower

Sid drops the saw With one final shove the tree is in
Phew Sid slams the back shut

SID
Ok But remember you asked for it

He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF
PAPER Hands it to Milo Milo unfolds it gives it a quick
look A second look A third

TIME STOPS THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT

MILO
No

SID
Yes

MILO
No

SID
Yes

MILO
No

SID

Are we done yet

MILO
Is this a joke Because if it is
Im gonna have to kill you

SID
Its not a joke

MILO
She got arrested And then she
jumped bail

SID
Apparently the whole thing started
with some reckless driving and
ended with her assaulting a police
officer

Milo gives him a questioning look

SID
(EXPLAINING)
She bit him

Milo snorts

MILO
Yeah That sounds like her
But heres my question why the
hell did you post her bail

SID
Hey I know she dumped you

MILO
Whoa She did not dump me

SID
(QUICKLY)
Ok whatever I

MILO
No not whatever I dumped her

SID
The point is Im aware you guys
have issues but Im running a
business here A person needs bail
I dont have time to check with you
first

MILO
Well had you checked with me
first you wouldnt be out of a
bond right now

SID
Im not out of a bond if you go
pick her up Its five grand to
bring her back by 9am Xmas day

MILO
head

(SLOWLY)
Youre telling me its five grand
to go pick up my ex-wife and bring
her to jail (beat) On Xmas

SID
Youre a good listener

Milo takes a deep calming breath Then he EXPLODES into
whoops and hollers He throws himself into a snow bank and
thrashes around He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post

SID
I take it youre interested

Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug

MILO
I love you Youre the best friend
a guy could ever have

SID
Ok take it easy

TERESA (mid 40s overly made-up popping gum) pokes her
out the front door

TERESA
Sid you got a DUI on line one
(off their looks) Whats going on

Milo drops Sid grabs Teresa and gives HER A LONG INTENSE
KISS He releases her She stumbles back a bit

TERESA
Ok (beat) Can I have my gum back

MILO
Right Sorry

He reaches into his mouth extracts her gum and hands it to
her She retreats back inside Milo beams at Sid

MILO
You know what this is dont you
Karma Payback You know how they
say What goes around comes
around Turns out its true
(MORE)

MILO (contd)
(checking the paper) That middle
initial stands for Rhonda by the
way She tells people it stands for
Rachel but thats a lie

Sid shakes his head

SID
I cant believe you guys broke up
over a stupid article

MILO
We didnt break up over a stupid
article We broke up because she is
a cheating manipulative liar

SID
Are you sure you can handle this

MILO
Why wouldnt I be able to handle
this

SID

Lets face it youre not exactly
rational around her I mean if I
was a cop working a case and some
reporter came snooping around Id
say no comment Not no comment
but care for a cocktail And then
a month later running off to some
love shack called Cavemans Cabin
and tying the knot Who does that

MILO
Thats not even close to what
happened For one thing it was
called Cupids Cabin And for
another that was before I knew how
conniving she was Now I know So
all I have to do is track her down
cuff her up and bring her in
(checking his watch) And Ive got
what two days Shit man Easy as
pie
