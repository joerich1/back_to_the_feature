KUMAIL (VO)
Hello I grew up in Pakistan And people
are always asking me what was that like
Really not that different from here I
mean we played cricket which is just a
spicer version of baseball And we prayed
a lot Well not a lot just five times a
day And we marry someone our parents
find for us Arranged marriage you know
For me it was probably that we got
episodes of the A-Team a little bit
later And by a little bit later I mean
we just got episode two But other than
that it was exactly the same

trying to mansplain to her that you

a star in a galaxy of a billion stars in
a universe full of a billion galaxies so
I forgot your birthday Who gives a shit
You are cosmically over reacting to this
Honestly you are being super selfish
Youre right but youre selfish

Kumail looks out at the crowd Dalavan enjoys CJ’s set

her hair She sits at a table with a few friends

KUMAIL (CONTD)

noticed you

She smiles

Crowded bar scene after the show Kumail Chris Mary and
CJ hang out at the bar

CHRIS
He just gave you Montreal Like you dont
have to showcase or audition or anything

CJ
It was too easy Like I wanted to
struggle I wanted a story to be able to
tell on talk shows and instead like you
guys dont know how hard it is not to
struggle Its a struggle succeeding
effortlessly

MARY
Did he say anything about me

CI
Sure

CHRIS
What about me

Cor
Both of you He said those guys
performed

way I have to tell you that when you
yelled at me it threw me off You really
shouldn’t heckle comedians Its so rude

EMILY
I didn’t heckle you I just woo-hooed
you It was supportive

KUMAIL
Okay thats a common misconception
Yelling anything at a comedian is
considered heckling Heckling doesn’t
have to be negative

listen to mom and grow a beard

KUMAIL
It gets really itchy Ive tried Its
all patchy

NAVEED
Try being a man and conditioning like I
do

KUMAIL
Whats the whole thing with Muslims
growing beards anyway Its such an
arbitrary thing Like who decided that

are the only one with the truth Is that
right The sun is just shining down on
you right now Its just parting like

involved in a hit and run or you got
caught forging some checks But a WHITE
GIRL Such a cliche

A white family stares in their direction

KUMAIL
It’s okay We hate terrorists

NAVEED
Listen I understand You’re in America
You wanna mow a few lawns and see what
it’s like But eventually you have to
marry a Pakistani girl Like I hung out
with other girls But then I married
Fatima We hardly spoke two words to each
other the first few months But now
Kumi shes like my best friend You have
to break up with her immediately

KUMAIL
If I find someone whos as good for me as
Fatima is for you Mom would understand
right I mean she wouldn’t love me less

NAVEED
She would definitely love you less
Slowly you’d sort of -- what’s the word
when guys stop returning girls’ calls

KUMAIL

fucking ghost you

looks increasingly distraught

INT HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - LATER
Terry speaks with Beth and Kumail

TERRY
They couldnt find out what the disease
was or where the virus came from or the
bacteria or whatever

KUMAIL
But they took out the infection so it
shouldnt matter

I know thats what I said but her vitals
didnt normalize And now they say that
the infection is continuing to spread
its in her kidneys

KUMAIL
But the kidneys are so far from the
lungs
TERRY
I know its an aggressive infection and
they said what they gotta do now is
figure out what this mystery disease
actually is

BETH
I’m calling Northwestern

misunderstanding

He holds up a bunch of HOSPITAL PASSES

KUMAIL (CONT’D)
This is all the visitor passes from when
I visited you when you were in the-

He holds up some TICKET STUBS

parents came to see me perform and I
realized how great they are and how
great you are and how great honesty is

He holds up a JAR FULL OF ASHES

EMILY
What did you do Did you cremate someone

KUMAIL
These are the ashes of all the Pakistani
women - not the women - the pictures of
the Pakistani women I thought this was a
good idea but it feels a little stupid

Kumail puts the items down and kneels before Emily

KUMAIL (CONTD)
I know I was a terrible boyfriend But
I’ve changed And I am the person you
need me to be I really am So will you
take me back

EMILY
Kumail I’m really glad that you went
through this experience but you have to
understand that all that happened while I
was asleep Like you felt one way a few
weeks ago and now you’re saying you feel
the total opposite way and the only thing
thats changed is that I was in a coma
Honestly I look at all of this and I
just think I cant do it again I cant
be the reason that you dont have a
family It just feels totally different
now And I cant do that again Do you
understand

dinner Kumail joins them We see he has another LARGE
BAG

KUMAIL
Ma Dad Fatima Bhai Theres no plate
Oh I forgot Ive decided I wont let you
kick me out of the family Since I ama
member of the family it would stand to
reason that I would get a vote in whether
or not I get kicked out and that vote
would have to be unanimous Standard
parliamentary procedure So all those in
favor of not kicking Kumail out of the
family raise your hand

Kumail raises his hand Everyone else stares silently

KUMAIL (CONT’D)

Okay youre giving me the silent
treatment I figured that was what was
going to happen I have a solution

Kumail pulls out cue cards from his bag and shows them
KUMAIL (CONTD)
“Hi How are you” Its just a real basic
one “Pass the salt” Practical Always
with the comedy Mom made that one
specially for you Kumail how did you
become so much more handsome than your
brother Naveed

NAVEED
Bullshit

Naveed and Azmat exchange a look

I admit this one is designed to stir up
some controversy Its interesting how
you cant really kick someone out of your
family because theyll always be your
family I agree with that one Its a
good one So I’m gonna leave these here
for you

Kumail leaves the cards on the dining table

KUMAIL (CONTD)
