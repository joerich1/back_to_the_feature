At rise we see the interior of a taxicab The trunk is open
and the number of the cab is revealed through the rear
window It reads 531 We see the cab lower as if something
of weight has been placed in the trunk The trunk then
closes

We hear keys jingling and footsteps A person walks around
to the driver side and opens the door We are introduced to
JESUS Jesus looks at the picture on the cab drivers ID He
pulls a lighter and melts the picture to an unrecognizable
state We see a picture of young Latin boy stuck to the
dashboard Jesus starts the cab and listens to it purr He
gently strokes the dashboard He drives toward the garage
exit He approaches a security guard that stops him The
security guard leans on the drivers’ window

picture from her and trys to tear it in half He becomes
frustrated when he can’t He then remembers his previous
conversation

(apologetic)
I didn’t mean to hit you

SIMON

JESUS
(pause)
You grabbed the wheel

SIMON

JESUS

JESUS

SIMON
My chance to escape

JESUS

SIMON
You get one shot and I missed it

JESUS

SIMON
Lack of discipline
While this conversation is taking place we notice the
Pregnant Woman and Casey are having their own calm
conversation in the backseat

PREGNANT WOMAN

CASEY

PREGNANT WOMAN

Meanwhile in the front seat Jesus pulls out a tin can

from under the seat He starts to shape it Simon watches

this in curiosity Jesus manipulates the can in such a way

that it creates a Marijuana Bong The Pregnant Woman starts
to sing “How dry I am” to Casey and sways back and forth
Jesus reaches into his shirt pocket

He pulls out some marijuana and sprinkles it into the
homemade bong

SIMON
(points to pocket)
You always keep it there

JESUS

Jesus lights the Bong and takes a hit Close up of bong

exhaled smoke streams across the frame Cut to extreme close

Jesus then passes the homemade bong to Simon who takes a hit
and then begins coughing Meanwhile Casey is singing in the
backseat The Pregnant Woman begins to sing with her Simon
takes another hit and then passes it to Jesus Simon is
relaxed

SIMON
(mellow)
Hey what happened to your meter

Jesus taps his head as he did in the beginning as if he’s
got everything written down in his head

SIMON
(continuing)
Oh right
(He laughs)

The song from the backseat becomes louder Simon and Jesus
Begin to join in and sing the song A few seconds go by of
them singing and then the Pregnant Woman listens as if she

has heard something

PREGNANT WOMAN
What’s that sound Shhhhh Shhhhh
What is that Where is it coming
from Do you hear it Stop the car

The group stops singing and listens Jesus pulls up toa
stoplight There is a pounding sound coming from the rear of
the car They all listen Just then the cab’s trunk pops
open Again we see the number of the cab 531 appear in the
window

Through the back window we see a man running full speed
down the street Simultaneously everyone looks at Jesus
Jesus smiles

JESUS
My partner

The other three look at him in shock for just a moment Then
Simon starts laughing Then they all start laughing
uncontrollably Jesus drives off They all start singing
again

ALL
How dry I am How wet I’1ll be If I
don’t find the bathroom key I found
the key I open the door It’s too
late it’s on the floor

We see Simon reach for Jesus’ camera in the front seat
He picks it up and points it at Jesus

ALL
(continuing)
How dry I am How wet I’1l be If I
don’t’ find the bathroom key I found
the key I open the door It’s too
late

We see a bright flash
There is a montage sequence of a violent train wreck Cut to

black Audio fade in of emergency vehicles and voices There
are bright lights and the flashlights Fade out audio

Cut To
EXT TAXI CAB -— JUNKYARD —- DAY

Through the half-open dingy drivers’ side window of 531 we
see deteriorated vehicles It is evident we are in a car
graveyard There is a small clearing in the foreground In
the distance we hear children’s voices approaching A small
group of children emerge from different angles running and
screaming toward the center clearing The children are out
of breath and excited

The children are engaged in a game of Ghosts in the
Graveyard which is similar to TAG They were running to the
center clearing to escape from being tagged An item at the
center clearing is home base The last child to reach home
base JAMIE was tagged

CHILDREN
(Improv chatter)

As soon as the children catch their breath they begin to
play another game Jamie turns with his back to the camera
and begins to count

JAMIE
One O’clock two O’clock three O’clock rock

As Jamie begins to count the children scatter throughout the
junkyard Two of the children run back and forth and then
decide to run and hide in 531 They open the rear driver’s
door climb in and sit posed silent with their backs up
against the door We see their faces filled with excitement
and fear of being caught One child notices the stuff in
the cab and begins to comment on the inside of the cab the
other covers her mouth and makes the quiet sign

Meanwhile Jamie has been counting

JAMIE
Nine O’clock rock ten O’clock eleven
O’ clock twelve O’clock rock
(yelling)
Ghosts in the Graveyard Here I come

Jamie turns around and scans the area for children He
looks around and then runs toward 531 We see the faces of
the two children in the cab listening with their eyes We
see Jamie look through the rear driver’s side window into
the cab right above the two children who are not making a
sound and holding their breath Jamie looks around and then
runs off The two have not been discovered They breath a
sigh of relief

The two children begin scanning the interior of the cab

Girl 1
What is all this stuff

Girl 2
I don’t know

Girl 1
It’s really creepy

The camera scans the inside of the cab revealing the
disarray of the items The items are all out out of order
there are car engine parts on the cab’s seat and floor
newspapers and Polaroid’s litter the entire area One girl
notices the lamb’ head on the seat she rises to get it

Girl 2
Hey look at that
(She rises)

Girl 1
Get down He’11 catch us

Girl 2
Girl 2 ignores the other girl and gets the head anyway

Girl 2
Where’s the rest of it

She looks around for it and notices the Mask She puts it
on

Girl 2
He won’t find me with this on How do I look

Girl 1
Shhhh We’re gonna get caught

Girl 2 notices all the Polaroid’s and starts to pick them
up She looks through the stack she has collected

Girl 2
Who you think they are

Girl 1
I think I hear them

The camera is over Girl 2 shoulder As she is flipping
through the pictures she stops at the picture with The
Pregnant Woman and Casey’s faces pressed up against the
outside of the front windshield The camera goes in tight

INT TAXI CAB - POLAROID FLASHBACK - BLACK and WHITE

Dissolve from the photo into live action The Women maintain
their balance on the hood of the moving vehicle They both
see the gun tumble off the side of the cab The cab then
comes to a complete stop They both emerge from the hood and
slowly take refuge in the backseat of the cab Casey picks
up the lamb’s head again and caresses it for comfort Casey
evaluates the missing gun from the Pregnant Woman’s hand

After a moment of reflection Casey turns to the Pregnant
Woman

CASEY
What now

PREGNANT WOMAN
You tell me

Casey contemplates the situation After a brief moment she
looks at the lamb’s head tosses it aside and turns to
Jesus

CASEY
Drive

JESUS
(pause)
Where to

PREGNANT WOMAN
(confidently)
Just drive

The Women look at each other with intense reflection In the
background the conversation between Jesus and Simon is
heard softly

JESUS
(Apologetic)
I didn’t mean to hit you

SIMON
Well you did
DISSOLVE TO

We come out of the flashback with the scream of one of the
other kids screaming into the open window of the cab above
the girls

Kid 1
Ghosts in the graveyard

Girl 1
Quick He’s coming

Girl 1 and 2 open the backseat door and run for the home
point in the clearing leaving the cab door open As Girl
2 leaves the cab she drops the Polaroid ontop of a
newspaper lying on the floor of the cab We see the children
exit the cab and then pan down to the picture After we see
the picture we follow the camera off the picture onto the
newspaper The headline reads
“Train Wreck 4 Killed Infant in stable condition”
The newspaper is old and worn The paper holds for a moment
then blows out the open cab door away with the children’s
laughter
(silence)

FADE OUT

THE END
