ADAM and EVE frolic about in the garden
BRAEBURN’S VOICE
Look at these assholes On the

fifth day God created them And
this is the best He could do

EXT APPLE TREE —- DAY

While Adam pokes a rock with a stick Eve plucks an apple

from the tree

BRAEBURN’S VOICE
His little moronic pets were given
one simple rule and thanks to
our CEO and founder they broke it

Eve takes a bite from the apple grins in delight
Inquisitive Adam jogs over Eve offers him the apple
hesitates then takes a bite

BRAEBURN’S VOICE
And that was it That’s how the
corporation began A simple
temptation to eat an apple

MONTAGE

Adam

- In a nudie bar people drink grope naked women toss money

around start fights snort coke

BRAEBURN’S VOICE
Humans What a waste of space

- A man sits on the edge of his bed hungover bottles
everywhere

- A business exec at his desk looking at internet porn
- A lady throwing her money away in a slot machine

BRAEBURN’S VOICE
Nonetheless God loves His wretched
inventions But my boss loves them
too

- A football player shoots up ‘roids in a bathroom stall
- A fat man stuffs his face with food in front of the TV

BRAEBURN’S VOICE
In fact he wants them all for
himself It’s my job to help him
- A group of bullies push around a kid at school
- A woman sits in a doctors office while the doctor marks
her body showing where he can nip and tuck

My name is Braeburn I work at

INT DRUNKARD’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

An old dirty DRUNKARD sits in a recliner chugs the rest of
his beer He hocks up a lung spits it into the beer can

A CAT rubs up against the Drunkard’s leg purrs The man
kicks it away

DRUNKARD
Get this damn cat outta here
Where’s my dinner

The Drunkard’s WIFE a haggard woman with a black eye pokes
her head in from the kitchen

WIFE
I told you it’1ll be ready in a few
minutes Keep your pants on

The Drunkard throws the empty beer can at her it barely
misses hits the wall She retreats back into the kitchen

DRUNKARD
Don’t you sass me woman or the
pants will come off

The Drunkard burps scratches his gut as he flips through the
channels Hold on his inebriated face

suddenly the image turns grainy as if he’s being filmed
The screen splits into two views - the frontal view of his
face remains and added below is his POV of the TV The
audio of the TV and surrounding ambiance turns to low
quality A name pops up on the screen “GILROY DEREK”

This image is up on a flat screen MAC-like computer-

INT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY - MAIN OFFICE AREA

-standing up staring at the computer is BRAEBURN He’s a
slender man (demon) in his early 40s

He wears a cheap suit and a Bluetooth is clipped to his ear
He stays focused on the Drunkard

BRAEBURN
Derek that paunchy bitch has been
treating you like dirt all week
You need to teach her another
lesson after dinner

Braeburn shares the cluttered office with about THIRTY other
business clad men and women (demons)

The chatter is loud as all these AGENTS speak into their
headsets to different individual people on their monitors

Braeburn covers his Bluetooth

BRAEBURN
Spigold switch me over

Across from Braeburn is a bespectacled bookish agent
SPIGOLD With lightning speed he follows Braeburn’s
direction and types several commands into the computer

ON THE SCREEN - the “GILROY DEREK” file is minimized and
another file is pulled up - “GILROY RITA” A video of
Derek’s wife pops up to fill the screen - she stirs a pot of
chili and ashes her cigarette into it

BRAEBURN
Atta girl Rita Give that no-good
husband of yours a little ‘extra
spice’ if you know what I mean

There’s a sense that something big is about to happen
excitement is in the air A few of the other agents begin to
gather round to watch Braeburn work Whispers about
Braeburn’s impressive manipulation skills are heard
BRAEBURN

Rita give that bastard a taste of

his own medicine
INT DEREK’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
As if the thought suddenly hit her Rita opens the cupboard
under the sink and takes out a bottle of CLOROX
INT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY - CONTINUOUS

Braeburn covers his Bluetooth turns to Spigold
BRAEBURN
I think I got a winner here
Spigold This could be it

He’s aware of the crowd watching him now and he loves it

BRAEBURN
Put me up on the big screen

SPIGOLD
You got it

Spigold types away then on a huge projection screen at the
front of the office the two “image files” of Derek and Rita
are displayed side by side

The entire office now watches Braeburn work his magic

On the screen - Rita comes into the living room with a big
bowl of chili She hands it to Derek He takes a whiff of
it then begins to dig in

Braeburn stands up and directs his attention to the screen

BRAEBURN
Derek have that woman fetch you a
cold beer to wash down that slop

DEREK
(on screen)
Get me a beer

BRAEBURN
Spigold back to-

SPIGOLD
I gotcha do your thing

Spigold taps away on his computer

BRAEBURN
(focusing on Rita)
Rita get him his beer you know
it’ll be his last

RITA
(on screen to Derek)
As you wish dear

WINESAP a young cocky agent trying to “tempt” his own client
is distracted by Braeburn showboating his talents

ON SCREEN - Derek eats away Rita steps in hands hima
beer all smiles Derek takes a drink from his beer Stops

His face turns red He begins to cough and choke He stands
to strangle Rita she simply backs off Derek falls on his
face

Braeburn takes off his Bluetooth pumps his fist in the air

BRAEBURN
There it is ten thousand baby

The agents applaud as Braeburn basks in his own glory

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A meeting is in session Half a dozen exquisitely dressed
EXECUTIVES sit around the conference table Standing at the
head of the table giving a lecture is ROME 40’s looks like
a GQ man of the year type

ROME
our campaign on new media has
driven our soul revenue up ten
percent this quarter but it isn’t
enough We need to double that

Rome eyes every single executive looking for a suggestion but
each remains silent

The door to the room opens and Rome’s assistant JONAGOLD
steps in rounds over to Rome whispers into his ear

Rome raises an eyebrow

EXT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY - MAIN OFFICE AREA

Up on the screen a giant ”“C-3” blinks over the dying body of
Derek

Overjoyed Braeburn turns around to Spigold

BRAEBURN
Ashes to ashes

SPIGOLD AND BRAEBURN
- and another one bites the dust
to dust

They shake hands On both of their wrists they wear RED
GLOWING BANDS

SPIGOLD
It’s been a long time coming
Braeburn
BRAEBURN
Thanks for the assist buddy It’s
time for me to move up the ladder

Winesap sighs he’s had enough of this gloating

WINESAP
Do you guys mind I have clients
to tempt here

BRAEBURN
Better watch yourself Winesap
Your talking to an exec now

Across the room Rome and the other executives watch the
commotion

Rome rubs his chin revealing a GOLD glowing band around his
wrist His eyes shoot up to a digital list up on the wall of
all the AGENT names with a number next to them At the top
is “BRAEBURN - 9999”

Braeburn spots Rome and company looking at him

BRAEBURN
Mr Rome print me out the pre-
judgment contract This deadbeat
human puts me at ten thou’

Rome nods over to Jonagold she runs off to her desk

Braeburn grabs his briefcase then rushes over to Jonagold’s
desk The printer next to her spits out a CONTRACT
Jonagold hands the contract to Rome who glances over it

ROME
Well done Winesap go collect him
for Braeburn

Winesap throws his hands in the air in protest
BRAEBURN
No boss I got this one For old
time’s sake
Rome nods “as you wish” He hands the contract to Braeburn
BRAEBURN
Crack the champagne I’m coming

back an executive

Braeburn files the contract away into his briefcase and
rushes out through the exit doors

The office is in a mixed mood jittery from the action yet
some faces show envy especially Winesap

ROME
Alright the show’s over Get back
to your clients

INT HOSPITAL - TRAUMA ROOM - DAY

DOCTORS and NURSES work on Derek trying to pump his stomach
A heart monitor barely BEEPS

The room and everything in it suddenly becomes FOGGY GRAY
HAZY Next to the doctors an apparition appears it’s
Braeburn holding his briefcase

(NOTE This cloudy spirit world among the living will be
referred to as the HAZE)

A NURSE reaches THROUGH Braeburn and grabs a few of the
surgical tools right where Braeburn stands

Braeburn pays no attention to her He opens the case
Inside are a few ZIP-TIES a roll of DUCT TAPE a GLOCK semi-
automatic the CONTRACT and a small STAMPING DEVICE

Braeburn takes out a ZIP-TIE peels off a strip of duct tape
He listens to the BEEP of the heart monitors It flat-lines

BRAEBURN
Music to my ears

Braeburn glances at the contract an illegible SIGNATURE
followed by a NOTARY-LIKE SEAL magically forms on the
contract then it GLOWS GOLD

BRAEBURN
Done deal

The DOCTOR working on Derek pulls the sheet over his body
calls the time of death

Braeburn steps over to Derek Hovers his hand over Derek’s
wrist grabs for it but his fingers go through

BRAEBURN
Come on

Braeburn tries again success He yanks Derek’s spirit
from his body and throws him to the floor face first

Before Derek knows what hit him Braeburn has expertly zip-
tied his wrists behind his back

Braeburn grabs Derek’s arm then quickly takes his STAMPING
DEVICE which now glows bright red and stamps Derek’s
forearm leaving a UPC code on it It sizzles as the man
struggles to no avail

Suddenly the clothing on Derek MORPHS into a RED JUMPSUIT
Stenciled on the front is a large “C-3”

DEREK
What’s going on here

Braeburn shuts him up by wrapping the duct tape over his
mouth Then Braeburn reveals the glowing contract

BRAEBURN
Derek Gilroy for a life lived full
of unrepentant sin you have been
judged by the powers that be to
spend eternity in the Third Circle
of Hell under the jurisdiction of
the city of Lost Angels

Braeburn yanks the confused man to his feet

EXT STREETS - “HAZE”

IN THE HAZE - A beat up Lincoln Town Car speeds down the
street whizzing through the cars of the living

INT LINCOLN TOWN CAR - “HAZE” -— CONTINUOUS

The back seat is heavily caged like a police car A thick
plexi-glass pane divides Braeburn from the rear

UP FRONT - Braeburn drives all smiles It’s nice and quiet
On his dash are dual temp and radio controls He turns up
the volume for the backseat and puts the heater on high

IN BACK - Derek still tied and gagged sweats his balls off
as the vents pump in hot air while awful MARIACHI MUSIC
blares out from the speakers

EXT STREETS - “HAZE”

The Lincoln comes to a line of similar Lincoln’s waiting to
enter a small structure that looks like an automatic car-
wash A sign above the structure says “SPIRIT REALM PORTAL”

When given the green light one car enters at a time A
sliding door closes behind the car A flash of light comes
from within The sliding door raises The car is gone
INT LINCOLN TOWN CAR - “HAZE” -— CONTINUOUS

Braeburn gets the green light He pulls forward into the
portal

Once inside the signal light turns red Braeburn stops

The door slides down behind the car Braeburn lowers his
window extends his arm out and waves his RED BAND on his
wrist underneath a scanner The scanner blinks “CIRCLE ONE”

There is a bright FLASH OF LIGHT The door in front of
Braeburn rises and the signal light turns green Braeburn
drives forward revealing Circle One of hell

But it doesn’t seem like hell Everything is the same as
where they just were Hell is a MIRRORED EARTH Only now
the haze is gone and the cars of the living have disappeared
replaced by cars of the inhabitants of the spirit realm

Derek looks around tries to process it all The sky is a
permanent bright red hue there is no sun

EXT HELL HIGHWAY

The freeway is packed with human souls all driving shitty
cars The human souls are recognized by the UPC brand on
their forearm along with having to wear a RED JUMPSUIT just
like Derek’s The only difference with Derek is that these
humans have a “C-1” (Circle One) stenciled onto the fronts
and backs of their jumpsuits

Anyone not wearing this red jumpsuit or UPC stamp is a DEMON
but they look just like the humans

There are dozens of people on the side of the road with
smoking cars or popped tires It’s sweltering

INT LINCOLN TOWN CAR - CONTINUOUS

Braeburn honks his horn as he makes his way to a special lane
that glows red like his band This lane is not as bad as
the others but it’s still bad traffic The lane next to
that one glows a gold color and fancy luxury cars zip along
without any traffic

A big sign on the freeway overpass says

“WELCOME TO HELL POPULATION 2875903877”

Derek sees this His eyes widen with fear

EXT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY

Braeburn passes a sign that says “CITY OF BEVERLY HELLS” He
pulls into the parking structure of a large luxurious
building

INT HELLEVATOR

Braeburn and Derek descend in the “hellevator”

The floors listed go from C-1 to C-9 The C-3 button is lit
up Muzak jingles in the background

Ding The “hellevator” door opens

INT C-3 DELIVERY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room is grungy crowded with various other C-3 humans
zZip-tied and seated It resembles a police booking room

Braeburn brings Derek up to the counter A large pot-
bellied BOOKING AGENT rises

BOOKING AGENT
Agent Braeburn how’s life

BRAEBURN
Couldnt be better This client
puts me at ten thou

BOOKING AGENT
I heard Guess this’ll be the last
I see of you then

Braeburn slaps the glowing contract on the counter for the
booking agent and winks at him

BRAEBURN
I certainly hope so

A DEMON GUARD hauls a crying SLOB C-3 HUMAN through a pair of
doors labeled “C-3 ENTRANCE”

Through the doors - Derek catches a glimpse of the Third
Circle of hell - a storm of rain and hail fall over humans as
laughing demons force the humans’ heads down into pig troughs
full of manure

The booking agent steps over to Derek and SCANS the UPC on
his arm with a wireless gun-scanner It beeps

BOOKING AGENT
There you go Delivered

Derek trembles turns to Braeburn

BRAEBURN
Nice doing business with you Mr
Gilroy If you have any problems
or concerns please feel free to go
fuck yourself Enjoy your stay

INT AGENCY - MAIN OFFICE AREA

The digital number on the soul collection board next to
Braeburn’s reads “10000”

On the other side of the room Rome POPS open a bottle of
champagne and pours it into his crystal flute Then he pours
for Braeburn who holds a cheap plastic champagne cup The
fluid that comes out turns from sparkling to flat and murky

The other agents of the office have gathered around and they
too have plastic cups with flat murky champagne All the
agents here except for Rome wear RED GLOWING BANDS just
like Braeburn

ROME
Put in the hard work and you can
get promoted too Not to mention-

Rome pulls out a velvet jewelry box Hands it to Braeburn

He opens it Inside is a GOLD GLOWING “PRIVILEGE BAND”
Braeburn salivates He snaps off the red glowing band from
his wrist and replaces it with the gold one The glow from
the red band dies he tosses it into the trash

Suddenly magically Braeburn’s cheap suit morphs into a
fancy pin striped suit His hair is slicked back it
glistens He looks like a million bucks Then the plastic
champagne glass that he holds morphs into a crystal glass-
flute like Rome’s and the champagne sparkles

Braeburn raises his glass for everyone to see his gold band

The other jealous agents raise their plastic cups and toast
him They drink Cringe at the taste

Braeburn sips from his glass Ahhh Delicious Then he
gloats shakes hands with his envious co-workers

WINESAP
(whispers to Spigold)
That’s all we need Another
egotistical jerk-off to boss us
around

SPIGOLD
Watch your tongue Winesap That’s
my friend up there and I’m next in
line on the board

WINESAP
Well see about that

Winesap reluctantly puts on a half smile as Braeburn turns to
him and shakes his hand

INT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY - OFFICE

Jonagold shows Braeburn into a nice office that over-looks

the putrid city below and the “HELLYWOOD” sign in the
distance

JONAGOLD
Here you are

BRAEBURN
Here I am I finally made it
Jonagold

JONAGOLD

Yes sir You deserve it

Braeburn takes a seat behind his desk feels the smoothness
of the fine oak On top of the desk is a device that looks
like an iPod He picks it up

BRAEBURN
Is this one of the new iTempts

JONAGOLD
Sure is It holds all your files
and allows you to tempt on the go

Braeburn plays with the iTempt all smiles He sets it down

JONAGOLD
I’m just curious what division
were you thinking of getting into

BRAEBURN
I always liked marketing I got my
temptation degree in that

JONAGOLD
Mr Rome was a marketing major He
created crystal meth-

BRAEBURN
-and the Easter Bunny I know He
loves to honk his horn about that

Jonagold giggles

BRAEBURN
Jonagold I’ve always wondered how
did a sweet girl like you end up
working for the corporation

JONAGOLD
Ahh The eternal question Like
most of the fallen I quit Heaven
and Co I was working under Rome
in the advertising department
When he was fired he promised me
greener pastures here so I
followed

Braeburn gives her a sad understanding smile

JONAGOLD
I still havent seen any green
pastures

She returns the sad smile and backs out of the room shuts
the door

Braeburn sighs sorts through his box of stuff He finds a
POLAROID PHOTO among a pile of papers He smiles A sense
of hidden longing in his eyes

BRAEBURN
I finally made it

He stares out the window at the “Hellywood” sign

The photo is an 80’s style picture of a beautiful BLOND WOMAN
(angel) wearing a birthday hat as she blows out a lit “2K”
candle on top of a cake Co-workers cheer in the background
but most notably Braeburn stands next to her giving her a
kiss on the cheek

EXT UP-STATE NEW YORK - SKYLINE

The skyline of New York

EXT SING SING PRISION - DAY

The infamous prison

INT SING SING PRISION - CHURCH HALL - DAY

A dozen prison INMATES sit and listen as a big brawny
prisoner preaches to them This is CLARENCE 35

CLARENCE
I’ve seen it brothers The second
your heart gives its last beat
they are there at the toe of your
dead body waiting to take you down

The inmates listen intently

CLARENCE
I’ve turned my life around I
suggest you do likewise otherwise
they will come to collect you

INTEXT SING SING PRISION - DAY

At the weight lifting bench Clarence spots an INMATE He
helps the man put the weights onto the support bar

INMATE
(sits up)
So these demons they look like
monsters Like in the movies

CLARENCE
Nah man They look like you and
me only they wear suits

A PRISON GUARD walks over holding some mail letters

PRISON GUARD
Clarence Morgan I got more returns
for you

The prison guard hands the letters to Clarence and walks off

Clarence sits next to the inmate on the bench and looks at
the letters They’re addressed to “LENDALE MORGAN” in
PHOENIX They’re stamped “RETURN TO SENDER”

INMATE
He’1ll open one sooner or later
Clarence Give him time

CLARENCE
Man I need to get through to him
I hear he’s dealing smack now

Saddened Clarence looks away Across the weight lifting
area he spots a SHIV being handed off to a GANG MEMBER The
Gang Member bee-lines to a PRISONER playing basketball

Clarence sees what’s coming He drops the letters and runs
over

The Gang Member nears his unsuspecting victim he readies his
shiv lunges forward

Clarence steps in his way blocking the Gang Member from the
prisoner Clarence puts his arm around the Gang Member and
veers him off as if they were pals

CLARENCE
You don’t want to do that my young
brother

The Gang Member startled and anxious runs off

Clarence looks down at his side The shiv is stuck into his
spleen Blood soaks his shirt

Clarence winces as he pulls the shiv out drops it He
begins to walk back to the bench press then falters He
drops to the ground as prisoners and guards rush over to him

IN THE HAZE - A few moments go by then Clarence’s soul gets
up from his body He dusts himself off

Clarence looks around Ten feet away from him he sees two
agents SOPHIEL the beautiful blond from Braeburn’s photo
and PEZNOUS a large intimidating man Both appear to be in
their thirties They wear casual business attire and have
ANGEL WING PINS on their lapels They give Clarence a warm
welcoming smile

Clarence spins back to see his dead body on the ground His
inmate friend and PRISON GUARDS attend to his body One of
the guards shakes his head indicating that he’s dead

Clarence looks back to Sophiel and Peznous He doesn’t
notice their angel wings but rather the GUN holstered into
Peznous’ belt

CLARENCE
No You’1ll never get me

Clarence spins around and books it out of there

SOPHTEL
Clarence no wait

INT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY - MAIN OFFICE AREA
The agents are busy “tempting” their clients

Winesap stares at his computer He hits a hot key and the
screen splits into 50 different files of people

WINESAP
(to Spigold)
This is bullshit Why did Rome
dump Braeburn’s client list on me

SPIGOLD
You’re a junior agent You need to
step it up Plus all the hard
work has already been done You
just have to keep tabs on them

Winesap sighs looks at the digital board Spigold is at the
top now at 9209 All the way near the bottom is Winesap’s
name at 1817

WINESAP
Great I’m gonna be here forever

SPIGOLD
Nah just a couple thousand years

Winesap moans to himself then he notices one of the files on
his computer blinking He clicks on it It’s a file with
the face of CLARENCE MORGAN on it A “C-8” flashes over it

WINESAP
Whoa I got a fresh one here

Winesap takes a closer look Something is off He rolls in
his chair over to Braeburn’s old desk rifles through a
cabinet drawer From a file he pulls out a GLOWING
CONTRACT

INT ROME’S OFFICE

Rome looks over the glowing contract then shifts his gaze to
Winesap as he stands in front of him smug as ever

INT BRAEBURN’S OFFICE

Braeburn opens his desk drawer A cigarette rolls into view
next to a matchbox Braeburn raises his eyebrows picks up
the cigarette It transforms into a nice fat CUBAN CIGAR

Braeburn sniffs the cigar savors the aroma then lights it
with a match He kicks his feet up and puffs on the cigar

A KNOCK at the door then Jonagold steps in
JONAGOLD
Excuse me sir Mr Rome would like
to see you right away

INT ROME’S OFFICE - LATER

Sitting across from Rome Braeburn reads over the glowing
contract a touch nervous

ROME
If I recall that client was a huge
fiasco for you Remember him

Braeburn leans back sighs as the memory comes to him

EXT STREET CORNER - “HAZE” - FLASHBACK

COPS barricade a crash site An ESCALADE is upside down
totaled The body of the DRIVER an apparent gang-banger
lies dead in the seat

Just outside the Escalade is the bloody body of CLARENCE ten
years younger He wears gang colors and a shotgun lies a
few feet away from him

As PARAMEDICS work on his body his spirit rises Clarence
looks all around can’t believe what he sees In front of
him BRAEBURN and another agent JERSEY MAC a large slob of
aman argue about something

They turn to see Clarence

JERSEY MAC
Boo

Clarence runs off Braeburn chases after him

INT ROME’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Braeburn rubs his temples closes his eyes

BRAEBURN
Yeah I remember him

EXT STREET CORNER - “HAZE” - FLASHBACK
As Clarence runs around the wreckage he barely escapes from
Braeburn’s grasp He spots his body being hoisted into an

Ambulance

Next to the ambulance Jersey Mac hauls off the spirit of the
dead DRIVER who now wears a C-5 red jumpsuit

Clarence thinks fast and makes a run for the Ambulance
Braeburn yells at Jersey Mac to stop him He doesn’t
Instead as Braeburn runs past Jersey Mac body-checks him to
the ground Jersey Mac laughs and walks off with the
driver’s soul in hand

AT THE AMBULANCE - EMT’s pull a sheet over Clarence’s body
Braeburn gets up pulls out his Glock

Clarence dives into his body

Braeburn FIRES an ELECTRICAL PULSE BULLET goes right through
Clarence’s body

The heart monitor in the Ambulance beeps
The EMT’s jump into action Clarence has come back to life

Braeburn tries to grab Clarence’s soul All he can find is
thin air He cries out in frustration

INT ROMES OFFICE - DAY
Braeburn opens his eyes

BRAEBURN
That was all Jersey Mac’s fault

ROME
That’s why he was fired But
that’s besides the point Mr
Morgan was extradited to Sing Sing
after his surgery

Rome taps on his keyboard The giant LCD screen behind
Braeburn comes to life It shows a map of New York and a
blinking red beacon Braeburn turns and glances at it
ROME
See there he is Somewhere in the
Bad Apple But you should know
that right Because youve been
keeping tabs on him haven’t you

BRAEBURN
Of course I have

Suddenly Rome SLAMS down a newspaper in front of Braeburn

ROME
Then what the hell is this in
today’s soul trades

Taken aback Braeburn looks at the “SOUL TRADES” It lists

off names like stock market figures Highlighted is

“CLARENCE MORGAN-35-MALE-NEW YORK-HEAVEN and COMPANY LLC”

Braeburn lowers the paper to see Rome fuming

BRAEBURN
Okay look he was judged to Circle
Eight It’s practically impossible
to redeem yourself from that

ROME
‘Impossible’ Without an agent to
tempt him the competitor can
easily sway a human’s mind

BRAEBURN
We have the contract There was no
reason for me to waste my time
continuing to tempt him

Rome seethes

BRAEBURN
He hasn’t been collected by the
competitor right So relax this
is no big deal I’11 send Winesap
to pick him up

ROME
You think Winesap is going to clean
up after you

Braeburn stays silent

ROME
Braeburn this contract is part of
your total soul tally - 10000
souls - but if Clarence Morgan
isn’t collected and the contract
isn’t fulfilled You’re back to
being one short

Braeburn grinds his teeth very frustrated

ROME
(winks at him)
I’1l let you keep your gold
privilege band for your trip

INT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY - MAIN OFFICE AREA
Up on the digital board Braeburn’s number is back to 9999

From his old desk Braeburn takes out his GLOCK It morphs
into a shiny silver-plated COLT SEMI-AUTOMATIC Impressed
he takes a second look at the gun then holsters it

All eyes are on Braeburn as he puts on his suit coat stuffs
the contract into the inner coat pocket and picks up his
briefcase He’s embarrassed to say the least

Winesap leans back in his chair as he revels in this sight
Spigold at his desk isn’t as cold He looks sympathetic

BRAEBURN
Spigold don’t let this little
peckerhead touch my files again

WINESAP
Hey it’s not my fault you let one
slip by old timer

BRAEBURN
You better learn to respect your
elders punk

WINESAP
(laughs)
Bring me back an “I Heart the Bad
Apple” shirt

Braeburn gives him the evil eye then storms out

INT AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - DAY

The coach section is a nightmare The sounds of crying
babies fill the air even though there aren’t any children

Every poor human soul that sits back there has to deal with
the annoyances of the worst flight you could imagine

The seats automatically jerk as if being kicked from behind

A STEWARDESS pushes her drink cart down the row making sure
she elbows all the humans’ heads on her way down

She notices that one of the soul’s seats isn’t jerking She
adjusts a knob and it continues to jerk

STEWARDESS
There you go

The poor human sitting there gives a meek smile

A C-1 HUMAN gains her attention hot air from the overhead
vent blasts him in the face

C-1 HUMAN
Miss a glass of water please

The stewardess takes a water jug and pours the contents into
a plastic cup It fills with nasty brown water and a couple
of dead bugs floating in it To top it off she spits in it

STEWARDESS
Here you are your majesty

The C-1 human takes the cup and reluctantly drinks from it

IN FIRST CLASS - Braeburn sits comfortably in a leather seat
sipping a glass of champagne His seat vibrates giving him a
massage and soft classical music plays into his headphones

INT ROME AND ASSOCIATES AGENCY - ROME’S OFFICE

Jonagold reads the “Soul Trades” She sets it down and looks
back up to Rome behind his desk

JONAGOLD
So how is this going to work if the
competition has a contract on the
human too

ROME
Our contract on Clarence Morgan is
still legit End of story

JONAGOLD
But if the competition’s contract
isn’t fulfilled won’t that mean

Rome gives a sly grin knowing what she’s talking about

ROME
Yes If I get this soul I’1l be
able to corner the entire market
(gives a stern stare)
You better keep this between us

INT APARTMENT — DAY

IN THE LIVING REALM - the body of a COLLEGE GUY hangs from a
noose attached to a hook on the ceiling A knocked over
chair is underneath his swinging feet

IN THE HAZE - Across the room the soul of the College Guy
lies on the ground face down He’s gagged hog-tied and
wears a GRAY JUMP SUIT with a “P” stenciled on it

Standing with a steel toed boot on his back is JERSEY MAC
Free from the confines of a suit he now wears fatigues and a
weapons vest He looks like a punk-rock mercenary

He takes a puff off a cigarette and exhales Around his
wrist is a BLUE PRIVILEGE BAND

JERSEY MAC
Nothing like a nice simple suicide
to start the day Isn’t that

Sophiel notices the gold band on his wrist

SOPHIEL

SOPHIEL
Material possessions and a rise in
social status is not a true reward

Says you Now I’d love to catch up
on old times but I’m busy so if
youll excuse me
Braeburn turns to leave

Braeburn slowly approaches gun trained He taps the gun on
Clarence’s shoulder to get his attention

Clarence slowly turns his eyes widen

BRAEBURN
Hi there Remember me

CLARENCE
No way

Braeburn whips out the contract for Clarence to see

BRAEBURN
Yes way Clarence Morgan for a
life lived full of unrepentant
deadly sin you have been judged by
the powers that be to spend
eternity in the Eighth Circle of
Hell under the jurisdiction of the
city of Lost Angels

Clarence nods slowly stands

Braeburn puts away the contract takes out a zip-tie

BRAEBURN
Good boy Now give me your wrists
It’s time to pay the piper

Clarence offers his wrists for Braeburn to tie them
Braeburn puts away his gun takes Clarence’s wrist and just
before he closes the zip-tie Clarence grabs Braeburn’s
wrist twists it punches Braeburn in the gut shoves him to
the ground and runs out of the room

Braeburn grunts Picks himself up looks up at the cross on
the wall frowns then runs out after Clarence

EXT SOUP KITCHEN - “HAZE” —- DAY

Clarence runs out through the entrance door looks one way
then the other - nothing but homeless waiting to get in

Suddenly Braeburn barges through the line of human homeless
and blind-sides Clarence to the ground

BRAEBURN
You’re not gonna escape me again

Like a seasoned pro Braeburn drops his knee into Clarence’s
back yanks his arms behind him and zip-ties his wrists

CLARENCE

This has got to be a mistake
BRAEBURN

The corporation doesn’t make

mistakes

Braeburn hoists Clarence to his feet shoves him against the
luxury car door

CLARENCE
But I repented I became a
counselor preached the good word

Braeburn takes out his iTempt pulls up a file shows it to
Clarence

BRAEBURN
This is your case file Over four
million pages of documented sin
You repented after the contract was
executed meaning your lucky second
shot at life was moot

CLARENCE
No it can’t be

Braeburn opens the passenger door takes out his briefcase
opens it and grabs the stamping device

BRAEBURN
Oh it is

Braeburn smashes the stamping device into Clarence’s forearm
It sizzles as the UPC number is embedded onto his skin

Clarence shrieks out Then his orange prison garb morphs
into a “C-8” red jumpsuit Clarence looks dumbfounded at his
new uniform Not much of a change for him really

BRAEBURN
Whattya’ know From one prison
uniform to the next It suits you
(opens the rear door)
Watch your head on the way in

Clarence doesn’t budge Braeburn grabs his arm Clarence
rips free

CLARENCE
You better step off demon

Braeburn sees the intensity in him Backs off smirks

BRAEBURN
Look I’m just the delivery guy
If there’s some kind of
complication here then we’1l
figure it out back at the office
Until then please let me do my
job okay Just hop in the car

As Clarence considers his situation he remains steadfast
Braeburn takes out his Colt threatens to uses it
BRAEBURN
C’mon human don’t make this

difficult

CLARENCE
If I’m dead what use is the gun

Braeburn shrugs and FIRES - an electric pulse bullet is sent
into Clarence and ZAPS him He convulses then drops to the
ground conked out

Braeburn looks at him and sighs

hungover

BRAEBURN
We use electro-pulse bullets

Braeburn takes out his silver Colt gun from his shoulder
holster pulls out the clip and shows Clarence the bullets
inside of it The bullets have a transparent casing It
looks like lighting bouncing around within the bullets

BRAEBURN
They basically knock you out The
bigger the bullet the bigger the
headache

CLARENCE
You mean we still have physical
limitations

not much different than in the

step up behind them with an angry looking C-5 HUMAN in her
grasp

Braeburn poses like James Bond holding the gun to his chest
while blatantly showcasing his gold band

The British Demon GALA laughs Braeburn steps out of line
and they greet by kissing each other on both cheeks Gala
gestures to the gold band

GALA
Congrats on the promotion
(re Clarence)
What’s with the human I thought
you were done

Braeburn slams the clip back into the gun and holsters it

BRAEBURN
There was a slight accounting
error But not to worry This

one is the last

GALA
And a C-8 nonetheless Very
impressive

Braeburn gives a humble “piece of cake” shrug

GALA
(to Clarence)
You should be honored to be
Braeburn’s last delivery human

CLARENCE
Yeah I’m thrilled

As Braeburn and Gala chat Clarence looks around He notices
that no other Human wears a C-8 jump suit Passerbys give
him strange intimidated stares

CLARENCE
(to the C-5 human)
‘Sup man What’cha in for

The man ignores Clarence and his attempt at a joke

Well darling I need to get going
I have to drag this import across
the pond
(to the C-5 human)
Don’t I

C-5 HUMAN

The British Demon digs into her purse pulls out a candy bar
waves it under the C-5 human’s nose

Clarence salivates turns to Braeburn

CLARENCE
Yo I could use a bite myself

BRAEBURN
That’s a Mud-Bar You don’t want
one of those

The British Demon unwraps the “Mud-Bar” and stuffs it into
the C-5 human’s mouth

CLARENCE
That doesn’t sound bad

BRAEBURN
It’s not made out of mud

Clarence gets the implication He gags
The C-5 human cringes as he’s force-fed the bar He pulls
away from the demon turns and coughs up the bar some of it
lands on Braeburn’s shirt
The British Demon smacks the C-5 human up side the head

Just as they turn the corner Jersey Mac steps in and punches
Braeburn right in the kisser which sends him to the ground

Braeburn pulls out his gun Jersey Mac kicks it out of his
hand sends it across the floor right to Clarence’s feet

Jersey Mac takes out a baton from his utility belt extends
it clubs Braeburn in the gut then spins to Clarence

JERSEY MAC

shuffling the silver Colt in with him shuts the door

Jersey Mac picks up Braeburn and shoves him against the wall
Punches and clubs him

Getting fired was the best thing
that ever happened to me

Mac hits a button on the baton and the end of it sparks He
prods at Braeburn SHOCKING him

Purgatory is where it’s at No
more suits ties crummy town cars
I’ve got it made However

Mac grabs Braeburn’s arm and examines the gold glowing band
compares it to the blue band on his wrist

JERSEY MAC
-us Purgatory folk can’t go above
blue privilege

Mac whips out a BOWIE KNIFE and CUTS OFF the gold band The
glow fades it’s dead

Suddenly without Braeburn knowing it his fancy suit morphs
into a hand-me-down thrift store suit His sleek hair and
shoes lose their luster He looks like a carpet salesman

Mac stands up laughs at Braeburn then turns to the stall

JERSEY MAC
You ready to rock back there
Clarence

Jersey Mac steps over to the door opens it and gets blasted
back to the sink spiderwebs the mirror He falls to the
floor out cold

Braeburn slowly rises to his feet The wounds on his face
begin to vanish

BRAEBURN
You were always sloppy Jersey Mac

Clarence steps out gun in between his zip-tied hands

CLARENCE

BRAEBURN
No he’ll be up again in a few
minutes now hand over the gun

Clarence glances at the gun - how it’s transformed back to
the Glock - then notices how Braeburn is dressed

CLARENCE
Did I miss something Did you just
get back from the flea market

Braeburn finally notices the awful suit He immediately
looks at his wrist - just a white tan-line from where the
band used to be He sees his severed band on the floor

BRAEBURN
No
He turns on the sink faucet Muddy water sputters out

BRAEBURN

Jersey Mac begins to moan

Braeburn curses himself as he moves into action He takes
out some zip-ties and ties Jersey Mac’s hands behind his
back then ties his ankles together

tobacco

Hey man you gotta help me

The guard glances at the C-8 on Clarence’s jump suit grunts
then spits a wad of chewing tobacco onto Clarence’s shoe

Braeburn races after him

Clarence flinches then continues to run He trips over some
luggage and eats the floor

Braeburn jumps on him Wrestles him down Clarence
struggles takes out the gun

Braeburn tries to rip it free but Clarence has a death grip
on it A few SHOTS ring out barely missing Braeburn

Braeburn whips out a pocket knife slips the blade under
Clarence’s trigger finger and SLICES IT CLEAN OFF

Clarence screams out in pain releases the gun to Braeburn

CLARENCE
You cut off my finger

Braeburn rises amused by this He holsters his gun

BRAEBURN
No I didn’t

Clarence jumps to his feet

out still tied up

to be from a different car To add insult to injury

tan-lined wrist to Clarence to explain why the car changed

cross the windshield It doesn’t help much at all

much better than the flat one he’s replacing

He tightens the bolts then turns to Braeburn

CLARENCE
What happened to his mom

BRAEBURN
She died of cancer you know that

CLARENCE
No what happened to her after

BRAEBURN
Unfortunately the competition
acquired her

Clarence sighs in relief releases the jack on the car

CLARENCE
Braeburn I want to see my boy

BRAEBURN
(laughs)
Yeah that’1ll happen

CLARENCE
Listen here demon you owe me I
saved your butt back at the
airport remember

BRAEBURN
I owe you nothing

Clarence shoves his finger into Braeburn’s chest forcing him
back a few steps

CLARENCE
If you’ve been dangling forbidden
fruit in front of me for my entire
life then you are partly to blame
for me being here

BRAEBURN
Thank you

Peeved Clarence turns and proceeds into the diner An “F”
health inspection letter on the door’s window

BRAEBURN
Where are you going Hey

INT DINER - DAY

The diner is smoky dirty and disgusting C-1 HUMANS eat
typical diner slop while DEMONS eat as well their meals a
bit better depending on the privilege band they wear

Clarence plops down at the counter bar

All the patrons stop and stare at him aware of the C-8 on
his jumpsuit A DEMON TRUCKER picks up his meal and scoots
down a few seats away from Clarence

Braeburn comes into the diner

BRAEBURN
I don’t have time for this-

Braeburn grabs Clarence’s arm Clarence yanks away

CLARENCE
If you want me to continue my
cooperative journey to eternal
damnation then you best give me
five minutes here

Everyone stares at Braeburn who looks like he’s being pushed
around by Clarence - the big C-8 human

Before Braeburn reacts a human WAITRESS clad in C-l red
jumpsuit steps over to them a bit hesitant Looks Clarence
up and down impressed

WAITRESS
Whoa cool I’ve never seen a
Circle Eight come through here
What can I get’cha

CLARENCE
I‘1ll take the special

WAITRESS
It’s pretty gross

CLARENCE
I would expect so Bring it

WAITRESS
Yes sir And you

The waitress and Clarence both look to Braeburn
BRAEBURN
(to Clarence)
Make it quick

INT DINER - LATER

A plate of moldy fries doused in mayonnaise and ketchup along
with a nasty looking green burger is in front of Clarence

The DEMON COOK in the kitchen winks at Clarence

COOK
Bon appetite jerk-off

Clarence eats it up not even phased The Waitress bites her

pen as she watches him enamoured
CLARENCE
(gives thumbs up)
My compliments sir

Braeburn grimaces at the food

CLARENCE

Believe it or not it beats the
prison food You want a bite

BRAEBURN
Are you serious

Clarence chugs a mug of flat beer

CLARENCE

Ahhh

(burps)

valuable

BRAEBURN
Your point

CLARENCE
Grant me a last prayer

let’s make a pit stop in Phoenix
Bring me up to see my boy

BRAEBURN
Out of the question

CLARENCE
Alright On the flip if you
don’t I’ll make this trip a
nightmare for you

Clarence takes a fork full of ketchup fries and flings it
the pie container

CLARENCE
I‘1l be the most annoying human
youve ever seen

Clarence jumps up on the counter then kicks the DEMON
TRUCKER’S food away along with all the utensils glasses
condiments It’s a mess

The Demon Trucker stands furious

CLARENCE
What’chu gonna do demon trash

The trucker stands down turns his gaze on Braeburn

BRAEBURN
Clarence

The waitress watches amused

CLARENCE
(back to Braeburn)
And you don’t have enough of them
tazer bullets to knock me out for
the whole trip

The Demon Cook runs out from the kitchen

COOK
The hell are you doing human

CLARENCE
Not to mention the lack of help
you’1l get without that privilege
band of yours

Clarence jumps down picks up a meal from another demon
customer tosses it onto the apron of the cook

at

and

The cook pissed to say the least takes out a shotgun from

under the counter aims it at Clarence

BRAEBURN
Don’t even try it He’s mine

The cook sees the band missing from Braeburn’s wrist

COOK
In that case

The cook aims at Braeburn FIRES the blast is a regular
shotgun not a pulse gun The buckshot BLOWS BRAEBURN’S ARM
OFF He reels back crouches over screams in pain

The customers are thoroughly entertained

Braeburn turns back around arm now fully regenerated but
the suit sleeve is all shredded up He draws his gun out
aims it at the cook

BRAEBURN
You ruined my suit

COOK
Screw your suit look at this mess
You better put a leash on this
human of yours or it’s gonna get
ugly in here

Braeburn glances at all the angry customers weighs his
options then lowers his gun motions to all the customers

BRAEBURN
I’ll pay for all this

COOK
Damn right you will city boy

Braeburn gives a stern look to Clarence who wiggles his index
finger at him - the one Braeburn chopped off at the airport

CLARENCE
Even in hell Karma will get ya

EXT DINER —- LATER

circumstances of what lies ahead
so unless things go hunky-dory
‘well see’ means exactly that

looks into Braeburn’s eyes

EXT OPEN FREEWAY

The Geo draws near to a PURGATORY CUSTOMS GATE

Braeburn sits idle at the customs gate Nervous he watches
the CUSTOMS OFFICER as he examines Clarence’s contract and
compares it with info on his computer

The suspicious officer leans down to look at Clarence then
eyes Braeburn’s shredded suit sleeve and tan-lined wrist

CUSTOMS OFFICER

BRAEBURN
The human here got a little frisky
A boom here a bang there it’s
all under control now

The officer smirks then looks back at Clarence who smiles
eager to get going

Braeburn forces a nervous smile

The customs officer eases up hands the contract back to

Braeburn turns around from the counter having just picked up
the two tickets to Hell-A He stops in his tracks to see
Sophiel and Peznous in front of him they are surprised to
see him disheveled in a crappy suit

SOPHIEL
Having trouble with Clarence

BRAEBURN
Nothing I can’t handle

He tries to pass by them but Peznous stands in his way

Braeburn continues on Sophiel and Peznous follow

SOPHTEL
Braeburn we need to talk

BRAEBURN
Sorry I’ve got a train to catch

Peznous steps out in front of Braeburn again this time he
reveals the gun strapped to his belt

SOPHIEL
Braeburn we can throw down right
here and get us all kicked out of

new classic gray suit tie draped over his shoulder He
steps in front of a full size mirror pleased with the suit

BRAEBURN
Okay shoot What’s your offer

SOPHIEL
We’re not negotiating

BRAEBURN
Then you’re wasting my time I’m
not handing him over for nothing

SOPHIEL
What do you want Money You’ve
earned gold privilege you don’t
need money

BRAEBURN
You know what I want

Braeburn turns to her a sultry stare

SOPHIEL
Can’t have it You lost what we
had when you became one of the
fallen

BRAEBURN
You won’t sacrifice yourself for
Clarence Isn’t that what an angel
is supposed to do

Sophiel steps close to Braeburn turns him around and wraps
her arms around him and knots his tie

SOPHIEL

(close to his ear)
I don’t need to do that because I
know you Behind your facade is
Casbriel Deep down you know that
hell isn’t what it’s cracked up to
be It’s as empty as those
privilege bands

Braeburn turns his face to hers lips inches apart

BRAEBURN
You’re right Without you hell is
one angel short of becoming heaven

Peznous rolls his eyes
Braeburn’s hypnotic gaze captures Sophiel

BRAEBURN
C’mon you’d be a terrific
temptress

Sophiel furls her brow pushes Braeburn away

SOPHIEL
Look the fact is if you deliver
Clarence to C-8 it contradicts
Gods guarantee for his admittance
into paradise

BRAEBURN
Paradise hah

SOPHIEL
Do you understand what I’m saying

BRAEBURN
(rambles perfunctorily)
If said contract isn’t fulfilled
then all Heaven and Company
contracts are deemed null and void

SOPHIEL
Yes and you know what that means

Sophiel rubs the material of his lapel

SOPHIEL
The apocalypse A soul free for
all It means you take off this
nice suit and get into battle
armor No more pulse guns either
We bring out the heavy artillery
You get shot you’re obliterated

The weight of the situation becomes apparent to Braeburn but
he continues to hold his smug arrogant grin

BRAEBURN
That gives you more reason to take
one for the team

She shakes her head ‘no’ steadfast

Braeburn stiffens he walks past Sophiel and intentionally
bumps into Peznous

BRAEBURN
I guess I’1l see you folks on the
battlefield

Peznous and Sophiel watch him go

NEAR THE BACK - Braeburn sits in the aisle seat while
Clarence takes in the scenery out the window

The bus stops A BOWLING ALLEY manifests from within the
infinite fields of grass

The bus driver puts on his glasses reads off a clipboard

BUS DRIVER
97850 - Adams This is your stop
enjoy your stay

An OLD C-4 MAN grins in delight as he steps off the bus and
dances toward the bowling alley

CLARENCE
Why’s that dude going into a
bowling alley He gonna be used as
the ball

BRAEBURN
No He’s going to get exactly what
he wants For eternity

The bus driver closes the door speeds on He looks at
Braeburn and Clarence in his rearview mirror then discreetly
lifts his CB radio and whispers into it

BRAEBURN
In fact your buddy Ricky’s here in
Circle Four

CLARENCE
Ricky from the hood He lucked
out This place don’t look half
bad

Braeburn takes out his iTempt reads a file from it

BRAEBURN
Ricky’s idea of heaven was to be at
Hooters on Superbowl Sunday with
all you can eat wings and an
endless supply of beer

CLARENCE
Yeah that’s Ricky alright He
loved him some Hooters

BRAEBURN
He got what he wanted An eternity
of flat beer superficial Hooters
girls mild wings and the
Broncos49rs Superbowl on repeat

Clarence gets the implications Doesn’t sound so good now

BRAEBURN
Greed That’s Circle Four

CLARENCE
So this is where you’d be if you
were condemned

Braeburn bites his tongue resenting that truthful remark

EXT DIRT ROAD - LATER

The bus drives onward

MONTAGE OF CIRCLE FOUR ‘DWELLINGS’

Everyone shows the same face of emptiness and misery

- A MOVIE BUFF surrounded by mountains of popcorn and soda
sits in an empty theater watching the Godfather on screen
- A GAMER plays PAC MAN in an arcade He fills out his
initials on the score screen He holds all the records

- A MILLIONAIRE lounges in a pool thousands of dollars
floating around him
- Finally RICKY sitting in a Hooters bar watching the
Broncos49rs Superbowl A fake smiling Hooters girl delivers
a pitcher of flat beer and a basket of wings to him The bar
counter is riddled with un-touched pitchers and wings

They’re simply an insurance policy

BRAEBURN
No need I’m bringing the human in

Braeburn hangs up looks at Clarence who gives him a scolding
stare

CLARENCE
Why do you have so much hatred for
humans Seems to me that we’re all
the same

Braeburn thinks carefully about this

BRAEBURN
We’re not the same We are a
divine creation You’re a second
rate pet project You see in the
old days before humans everything
was nice and simple Peaceful
You weak humans messed that all up

CLARENCE
(laughs)
No see cuz God saved the best for
last It all makes sense now

BRAEBURN
Oh

CLARENCE
You got it wrong Before humans
angels like you were omniscient
lived for eternity knew nothing of
sickness or fear or death

Braeburn leans back arms folded enjoying this

CLARENCE
Then some of the angels became
arrogant and prideful They wanted
more power More freedom So
these bratty angels followed their
leader underground

Braeburn grunts a laugh

CLARENCE
See it’s fallen angels like you
who are the ‘weak’ creatures God
realized this and put forth a
different kind of angel on earth
He made them mortal gave them no
answers no knowledge of anything

Braeburn nods in agreement humoring Clarence

CLARENCE
He tests His earthly angels with
original sin And those who are
faithful through life are granted
entry into Heaven Until then
you me we’re all the same What
do you think about that

BRAEBURN
I think you must have been one hell
of a good preacher in prison
because that’s the most ludicrous
thing I’ve ever heard

Granny Smith looks out the window at the falling snow
GRANNY SMITH
Whattya know It’s a cold day in

Braeburn feels for his gun inside his coat it’s gone

Granny Smith crosses the car and takes a 9 iron out of a golf
bag practices some golf swings

GRANNY SMITH
Did you know that during his time
in prison that human swayed the
minds of over two hundred and fifty
men Six of whom were on a path to
the Eighth Circle

Granny Smith sets up to take another imaginary shot
GRANNY SMITH
You know how rare it is to get
humans into the Eighth Circle
Granny Smith sets down the club takes out the contract
GRANNY SMITH
But this contract can change all
that Once Clarence is delivered

I’1l be swimming in fresh souls

Clarence

CLARENCE
What’chu gonna do Scratch your
nails along a chalk board Make me
drink hot sauce Eat tin foil
Red laughs jumps on top of Clarence straddles him
RED DELICIOUS
That’s petty first circle stuff
How about a taste of what’s
awaiting you in C-8
She cups her hands around his face Her eyes turn black
matching the onyx band on her wrist She kisses him Her
touch makes Clarence’s body go stiff
LIGHTNING QUICK FLASH - of dozens of horrible sins that

Clarence has committed against others in his lifetime - only
here Clarence has the POV as the victim of these sins

INT PASSENGER TRAIN - MIDDLE CAR
The sound of Clarence’s SCREAMS fill the air
Braeburn shoots a look over to the rear car door
GRANNY SMITH
I guess Red Delicious couldn’t wait
to get home
Braeburn looks concerned Granny reads this

GRANNY SMITH
Would you care to join her

BRAEBURN

Granny Smith tosses the golf club to Braeburn

Red Delicious hops off of Clarence Pats him on the head

GRANNY SMITH
Sorry to interrupt but I want to
share the fun with Braeburn

RED DELICIOUS
By all means

Clarence sees the club in Braeburn’s hand grows anxious

CLARENCE
Braeburn don’t do it bro

Braeburn raises the club head to Clarence’s face measuring
the distance to hit him with it Clarence sweats bullets

Then Braeburn swings the club back hard right at Red
Delicious but she catches the club-head before it hits her

RED DELICIOUS
(smirks to Granny)
So predictable

With club-head still in her hand Braeburn shoves the shaft
forward smashing the club it into her face She SQUEALS
out reels back

Braeburn swings for Granny Smith nails him in the head
sends him to the ground

Granny Smith rips out his gun Braeburn pounces on him
They struggle over the gun

The dogs in the adjacent car bark and scratch at the door
Red Delicious screams and charges

Braeburn spins around the gun FIRES hits Red Delicious
The force blasts her back to the wall

Braeburn knees Granny Smith in the nuts which allows him to
rip the gun free He SHOOTS Granny Smith - the blast doing
no damage except for throwing him to the ground The
contract sticks out from his vest

Braeburn quickly snaps up the contract then spins around to
release Clarence from the chair

Red Delicious slowly rises One of her MARBLE bombs falls
out of her pocket and rolls to Braeburn

RED DELICIOUS
You just committed career suicide

Braeburn spots the marble bomb picks it up

BRAEBURN
Career suicide huh I guess that
makes me eligible to work in
Purgatory

Granny Smith gets to his feet He and Red progress toward
Clarence and Braeburn as they back up to the exit door

Braeburn twists the top of the marble bomb It BEEPS

GRANNY SMITH
You know that won’t hurt us

BRAEBURN
Yeah but it’1ll leave a big mess
for you to clean up

Point taken They stay back
GRANNY SMITH
What’s the point Braeburn The
second you deliver him he comes
back to us
RED DELICIOUS
Granny Smith I think Braeburn has
had a change of heart I think he
intends on delivering the human to
the competitor
Clarence looks to Braeburn ‘would you’

Braeburn gives nothing away He picks up the golf club and
leads Clarence out the rear exit

EXT PASSENGER TRAIN - REAR CAR

Braeburn slams the door shut secures it with the golf club

Granny Smith tries to open it to no avail He gestures for
Red to climb up on top of the train

Braeburn turns around on the small ledge train tracks rush

The train crosses a massive bridge that spans over a gorge

CLARENCE
What now

Braeburn looks over the edge Below the bridge a good two
hundred yards down is a roaring RED RIVER

Braeburn stops turns Granny Smith has broken down the door
and climbs up to flank them

The train is half way over the bridge The marble bomb in
Braeburn’s grasp indicates it’s about to blow

Granny Smith and Red close in

Braeburn tosses the marble bomb to Red She catches it and
quickly deactivates it Cocks her head at Braeburn

EXT RIVER STYX

Braeburn and Clarence are rushed down the rapids of the
river They try to swim out but suddenly a SWARM OF HANDS
reach out from within the river grab hold of them and yank
them under

INT RIVER STYX - BATTLE ARENA

The hands belong to a MOB of ANGRY C-5 JUMPSUIT WEARING HUMAN
SOULS as they push and shove Braeburn and Clarence through to
an open battleground Note there are no demons here at all
This is a chaotic realm full of insanely pissed off humans

It’s a swamp-like marsh The humans appear to be blood
thirsty maniacs They scream at Braeburn and Clarence
goading them on to beat the crap out of each other

Clarence looks to the sky - the translucent red rapids of the
river rage above them

Suddenly a blood red neon sign lights the stage It has a
CIRCLE WITH A FIVE within it

CLARENCE
Let me guess We’ve drowned into
the Styx the fifth circle What
is it a world of wrath

BRAEBURN
Good work genius You’re finally
getting it now

CLARENCE
Screw you

BRAEBURN
Screw me I just saved your ass
back there

CLARENCE
What for Granny Smith said it
himself I’m gonna end up in his
hands anyway

BRAEBURN
You’re right I should’a joined in
on the fun and tee’d off on you

CLARENCE
What the hell is your problem

BRAEBURN
Welcome to the Styx This is what
it does

CLARENCE

You mean it makes you wanna beat
down some jerk like yourself

The humans start to throw garbage and other debris at them
chanting for them on to fight

BRAEBURN
Pretty much That’s the gist

CLARENCE
Well I don’t need no stupid river
to make me feel like that

Clarence seethes He snatches a baseball bat from a human
and charges at Braeburn Smashes him in the side with the
bat sending him into the marsh

The crowd cheers them on

CLARENCE
This is a long time coming demon

Braeburn spots a long chain hanging around a human spectator
he gets up and takes it from him

Clarence circles Braeburn winding up for a swing

CLARENCE
I used to beat up punk-ass bitches
like yourself all the time back in
the hood

BRAEBURN
Bring it on human

Braeburn whips his chain slashes Clarence across his face

Clarence wipes the blood from his cheek The wound quickly
seals back up Clarence circles around Braeburn

CLARENCE
I’1l never let you take me to the
Eighth Circle

BRAEBURN
Fine by me I’11 skip my promotion
and continue the grind However
I’1l be sure to focus all of my
efforts on your precious son

That hit a nerve Clarence attacks swings his bat wildly at
Braeburn cracks it over his arm breaks it

Braeburn stammers back holding his arm He snaps it back
into place

CLARENCE
You so much as go near my boy

BRAEBURN
I’m gonna be on him like sugar to
candy I don’t need to take you to
see your son in the living realm
because you’ll get to spend
eternity with him here in hell

Clarence loses it he charges and unleashes pure fury bats
Braeburn over the head and sends him to the swamp water
Then he pounces on top and punches him over and over the
crowd cheers him on

Clarence tosses the bat aside and chokes Braeburn Submerges
his head under water The crowd roars

Clarence has a maniacal look in his eye He brings Braeburn
up from the water punches him into a bloody pulp then he
stops to catch his breath
Braeburn seems to be in bad shape he spits out a tooth
BRAEBURN

This is the Clarence I remember

tempting all those years ago Nice

to see you again

These words deeply affect Clarence He lets up

Braeburn’s face heals over He smiles the missing tooth
regenerates

Clarence helps Braeburn to his feet
CLARENCE
I’m sorry I’m not that man

anymore

Braeburn is a bit taken aback by this

The crowd boos

CLARENCE
How do we get out of here

BRAEBURN
You have to release your hate

CLARENCE
I already have-

Clarence is suddenly shot up to the riversky and disappears

Braeburn sees him go The angry human crowd begins to close
in on Braeburn he closes his eyes The crowd engulfs him

fists and blunt objects wail down on him

Then the crowd flies back as Braeburn shoots up to the sky

EXT RIVER STYX
Braeburn emerges from the rapids gasps for air

The river is calm now however it’s opening up to the LAKE
FIRE It no longer snows they’ve traveled for miles

Braeburn swims to the river bank and claws his way out to
find Clarence waiting for him

BRAEBURN
Why didn’t you run

CLARENCE
I thought about it but you’re my
only chance to see my kid Right

BRAEBURN
This trip has been far from ‘hunky-
dory’ so I’m still sticking with
‘well see’

back there about not taking me to

BRAEBURN
Sorry The Styx makes you say a lot

Clarence nods then he gets pumped up boxes the air

CLARENCE
Okay so how is this going to work
Am I going to appear as a ghost to

mirror or something like that

BRAEBURN
You want to communicate with him

CLARENCE
That’s the point isn’t it

BRAEBURN

You talkin’ about possession

BRAEBURN
Illegal possession of living
bodies It’s the only way
However it also makes us easily
traceable so we have to make this
quick

CLARENCE
What do you mean

BRAEBURN
Think of it this way as spirits
we’re all connected to one divine
source within the spirit world
But once we enter the living realm
the divine source keeps tabs on us
A vague GPS system of sorts

CLARENCE
So it’s like being on house arrest
When you cross the line the po-po’s
know where youre at

BRAEBURN
For the most part But when you
posses a body it’s two spirits
within one body The blip on the
map shines twice as bright and pin-
points where you are

You possess a crazy bum who talks
to his stuffed animal on a daily
basis no one notices Dig

Clarence laughs nods

Fine let’s do this

Shifty pulls out his iTempt taps on it Then he puts a
GREEN GLOWING BAND - similar to a privilege band - onto each
of their wrists

readies himself to dart out

Braeburn yells out in frustration as Jersey MacCabbie walks
right through him

Braeburn turns trying to grab Mac’s spirit but instead he
finds his hands grabbing onto Granny Smith’s jacket

GRANNY SMITH
Here it comes again

Granny raises his gun and FIRES The blast nails Braeburn in
the face and sends him flying back to the ground

Granny and Red turn their fire back on Peznous and Sophiel

Red Delicious grabs for ClarenceBum - her hand just goes
through him She curses

Jersey MacCabbie seems to sense this and grins

They hurry over to the taxi walking through Braeburn’s
unconscious spirit as they get in and speed off in the car

Granny Smith runs after the taxi but it’s no use

Red and Granny turn their attention on the helpless Peznous
and Sophiel Red pulls out a handful of marble-bombs about
to toss them at Sophiel and Peznous

Then a Heaven and Co CHOPPER comes flying in shooting it’s 50
caliber mini-gun REAL BULLETS at the minions

A bullet RIPS OFF RED’S ARM she screams out in pain The
marble bombs roll away from her and begin to EXPLODE

As Red’s arm regenerates she and Granny flee

Four more Heaven and Co cars arrive the agents jump out
firing upon the minions

Granny and Red retreat into their Camaro The Rottweilers
jump in with them and they tear off down the street as the
mini-gun’s bullets from the chopper chases them away

As the wounded Heaven agents heal up and the smoke from the

bombs clear Sophiel walks over to Braeburn and frowns at the
sight of his unconscious body

by Mac He reaches for the door MacCabbie grabs for him

ClarenceBum grips the wheel cranks it

The taxi veers off CRASHES into a parked car The air bags
pop out protecting them

Jersey MacCabbie and ClarenceBum fight each other in the
taxi fists flail

Then all of a sudden a BEEPING NOISE goes off and they are
exorcised from the bodies

SHIFT INTO THE HAZE

Clarence and Jersey Mac fall out of the bodies The beeping
is from their green bands as it flashes 0 MINUTES

Clarence tries to escape but Jersey Mac whips out his pulse

Braeburn gets up stares out the window to the city below
Light traffic No pollution No loud honks or noise A
small smile curls on his lip

Braeburn takes a seat behind Sophiel’s desk leans back

Sophiel walks over to him and hands him a Polaroid - the
birthday photo of Sophiel and Braeburn

It’s just a small keepsake

She takes a look at it from behind his shoulder

Apparently he’s made a deal with
Rome similar to yours

BRAEBURN
A deal with the proverbial devil

BRAEBURN
Sure if you can get me back on the
company roster

SOPHIEL

You know what happens to me if
Clarence isn’t delivered to hell

SOPHIEL

That doesn’t matter This isn’t

about you
BRAEBURN

Sophiel if he’s not delivered I

Braeburn laughs at that Sets down the drink

In front of him in the business class a few DEMON TEENAGERS
pick on a young C-1 HUMAN They tease and mock him

A mirror image of himself He rubs the angel wing pin

One of the demon teenagers sticks a wad of gum into the C-1
human’s hair ruffles it about They laugh and poke at him

Braeburn’s had enough He gets up walks down the aisle to
the junior agent snaps the iTempt from him smashes it to
the floor and stomps on it Before the Junior Agent can
react Braeburn leans down to his face

BRAEBURN
One more word from you and I’‘1l1
toss you out of this plane
The agent does as told freaked out
Braeburn turns to the teenager demon who put gum in the
human’s hair He plucks a piece of gum from the bottom of a
seat and rubs it into the teens spiky hair
Everyone on the plane demons and stewardess included are
dumbfounded and petrified Except for the C-1 Human with the
gum in his hair
