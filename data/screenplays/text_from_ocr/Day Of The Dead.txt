DAY

OF

THE

DEAD

(The original script)
by George A Romero

FADE IN
1 EXT THE EMPTY STREET OF A CITY - DAY

No people A FEW CARS AND TRUCKS are parked at odd angles abandoned
A TITLE FADES IN one phrase at a time

FIVE YEARS
SINCE THE DEAD FIRST WALKED

2 EXT THE CITY - DAY

We hear THE SOUND OF A STRONG WIND DEBRIS flutters through the
streets A LARGE ALLIGATOR slithers into frame stops and looks
around

MONTAGE as MORE GATORS explore the empty streets knocking over
GARBAGE CANS upsetting the MANNEQUINS in A DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW
A GATOR crawls out through the open doors of AN ABANDONED BANK LOOSE
BILLS are dragged along under the animals tail They flutter away on
the WIND

3 EXT THE CITY - DAY

GATORS crawl over A 79 CADELLIC A FEMALE SKELETON sits slumped over
the steering wheel In the back a BABYS BONES are strapped into AN
INFANTS SAFETY SEAT One of the gators THUMPS its tail maddeningly
against the windshield ANOTHER TITLE APPEAR

FLORIDA - 1987
4 EXT THE CITY - DAY

CLOSE ON A SECTION OF PAVEMENT as we hear THE SOUND OF SLUGGISH
FOOTSTEPS approaching A SHADOW appears at the bottom of the frame
It gets longer and takes on the shape of a man

TIGHT ON THE AFTERNOON SUN blinding us Into the FOREGROUND lurches
THE FIGURE which cast the shadow Glare obscures all facial detail
until the head jogs into position directly in front of the fiery ball
in the sky Then we see its hideous dead eyes its blue-grey colour
the blackened wound where a large portion of jaw has been ripped
away This is a ZOMBIE A MUSIC CHORD SOUNDS and THE MAIN TITLE
APPEARS
DAY OF THE DEAD
5 EXT THE CITY - DAY

HEAD CREDITS ROLL over A MONTAGE the CITY STREETS are now populated
by the WALKING DEAD In every shape size and colour they wander
without purpose up and down the avenues in and out of buildings
The city is theirs they have inherited the place Man in his human
form seems to be gone

As the CREDITS END we CUT TO
6 EXT A MAIN STREET - DAY

We are looking down from a HIGH ANGLE The corner of A TALL BUILDING
is in the FOREGROUND A CORPSE is dangling from A NOOSE Its been
dead for some time Its mostly bone now its blackened flesh picked
clean by scavenger birds and harbour rats A SIGN flaps against its
chest cavity Its hurriedly scrawled message reads TAKE ME LORD I
LOVE YoU

THE ROPE BREAKS suddenly and THE CORPSE FALLS out of frame

7 EXT THE STREET - DAY

Were at GROUND LEVEL nowSMACK THE CORPSE HITS THE PAVEMENT and
SHATTERS as though made of potters clay BONES bounce over a wide
area THE SIGN is carried off by the WIND

8 EXT AN ABANDONED MARINA - DAY

THE SIGN gallops across the grass of A HARBOUR PARK towards the water
where A FEW DERELICT BOATS sway in the WIND

Slowly THE SOUND OF A MOTOR FADES IN

9 EXT THE MARINA (CLOSER ANGLE) - DAY

A FISHING BOATS old and sea-worn chugs into the harbour

10 EXT THE MARINA (CLOSE ON THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

There are people on board THREE MEN AND TWO WOMEN They look like
guerilleros from somewhere in Latin America Theyre heavily armed
unshaven covered with months worth of jungle crud They are
obviously exhausted They gaze up to the city Their deep-sunken eyes

are too war-weary to show much emotion but we can read their despair

TONY
Another dead place I tol you Lets get
out to the islands

MIGUEL
The radio signals were coming from this
area

TONY

Not from the city In every city its the
same Dead Lets get out to the barrier
islands If there are survivors sending
those signals thats where well find them

MIGUEL
Plenty of time for the islands The rest of
ourlifeon the islandsI think

Miguel is drifting The sight of the dead city has pushed him a few
inches closer to the brink of insanity He catches himself and comes
back toward reality

MIGUEL

We gotta see if there are others here We
came all this way Were gonna check it
out

11 EXT THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

CLOSE ON THE OPEN GASOLINE RECEPTACLE in the hull of AN ABANDONED
BOAT A WOMANS HANDS shove a LENGTH OF HOSE down into the hole

The woman MARIA puts the other end of the hose to her mouth and
sucks the air out

At ANOTHER DERELICT BOAT TONY sucks on ANOTHER HOSE

TONY
Ptoooo Nothing Dry as a bone No gas
Lets get outa here

MIGUEL
Check them all And check the tanks under
the pumps

MIGUEL and the other two guerilleros SARAH AND CHICO start to walk
up the dock towards the harbour park toward the city MIGUEL has AN
ELECTRONIC BULLHORN in one hand his AUTOMATIC RIFLE ready in the
other

12 EXT THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

THE TRIO of refugees move across the grass The WIND blows DEBRIS
around them as they stare towards the downtown buildings MIGUEL
lifts THE BULLHORN to his mouth

MIGUEL

HELLO IS THERE ANYONE THERE HELLO
HELLOOOOOOO

13 EXT THE CITY - DAY

MONTAGE as THE WALKING DEAD hear that human VOICE Throughout the
city they turned towards THE SOUND at once confused and excited

MIGUEL (o0s)
HELLOOOOOOOOOOO

THE DEAD start to GROAN hungrily almost pleadingly All over the
city their VOICES RISE

14 EXT THE HARBOUR PARK - DAY

It comes to MIGUEL AND THE OTHERS as A MASSIVE WALL OF NOISE THE
SOUND of hundreds-of-thousands of damned souls moaning on one solid
voice The sound of hell on earth

15 EXT THE MARINA (AT THE DOCKS) - DAY

TONY AND MARIA hear it as well and feel the familiar grip of cold
fear Maria makes the sign of the cross

MARIA
Dios mia

TONY
I tol him I tol him this is a dead
place Like all the others

CuT TO
16 EXT THE CITY (FROM THE WATER) - DAY

We see the place FROM A GREAT DISTANCE In the FOREGROUND THE FISHING
BOAT with all five REFUGEES back on board chugs into open waters

CuT TO
17 EXT A SMALL PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Away from the city this dock is wooden rickety DERELICT BOATS rust
at their moorings THE FISHING BOAT is tied-on at one end of the pier
and THE GUERILLEROS are moving through the area scavenging This
time CHICO helps MARIA with the SIPHON HOSES TONY lingers sullenly
near the fishing boat which has its motor still idling
MARIAS SIPHON HOSE is stuffed into the gas tank of A LARGE TRAWLER
She sucks on the hose and unexpectedly foul tasting liquid fills
her mouth

MARIA
AY GASOLINA GASOLINA

Without warning A FIGURE pops up from behind the side wall of the
trawler He reaches out and grabs the woman pulling her against the
boat his arm around her neck a pistol to her head

TONY sees the action He dives into the fishing boat crawls over to
his RIFLE and scrambles towards the pilots controls

With a lightning move MARIA pulls A KNIFE from her belt She
wrenches around and PLUNGES THE BLADE INTO HER ATTACKERS CHEST The
man staggers back screaming MARIA breaks away and runs across the
dock THE MAN FIRES HIS PISTOL wildly

MARIA IS HIT IN THE ARM She tumbles forwards onto the decking
TONY reacts OPENING FIRE WITH HIS AUTOMATIC

BULLETS RIP INTO THE ATTACKERS CHEST HE FALLS OUT OF THE TRAWLER
onto the dock but TWO MORE GUNMEN appear behind him mean-looking
desperadoes with RIFLE SPITTING LEAD

TONY ducks as low as he can He grabs the controls and pilots the
fishing boat along the edge of the dock toward the downed woman

18 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUEL SARAH AND CHICO react to the gunfire They draw their WEAPONS
and look for cover

They are at the far end of the dock their backs to the sea There is
a WORK SHED nearby BULLETS WHIZ past them as they charge towards the
wooden structure They make it there safely and they begin to RETURN
FIRE A gun battle ensues between the two groups

19 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MARIA her ARM BLEEDING rolls off the dock and into THE FISHING
BOAT TONY guns the engine and the boat pulls out into open water

THE ATTACKERS try to FIRE AT THE ESCAPING BOAT but they are forced to
duck BULLETS which RICOCHET OFF THE TRAWLER pinning them down

20 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

MIGUELS RIFLE is in his right hand His left hand clings to the
frame of AN OPEN WINDOW on his side of the shed Theres a SUDDEN
STARTLING MUSIC STING and with it A ZOMBIE appears inside the open
window Grotesque and drooling dark SALIVA its hungry mouth lunges
at MIGUELS left arm ITS TEETH TEAR A LARGE STRIP OF FLESH OUT OF
THE ARM six inches above the wrist

MIGUEL screams He pulls away from the creature his terrified eyes
staring at the BLEEDING WOUND A zombie bite means infection and
almost certain death

THE ZOMBIE leans out through the open window its hands clawing the
air trying to reach MIGUEL SARAH pulls A GIANT 45 from her holster
belt BULLAMN BULLAMN BULLAMN She FIRES three rapid shots

THE SKULL OF THE ZOMBIE INDENTS IN FRONT like a hard-boiled egg shell
thats been whacked with a spoon bowl BLACKENED BLOOD AND BRAIN
MATTER FLIES OUT OF THE BACK where the bullets exit The creature
falls destroyed

21 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH acts quickly She lunges towards CHICO and snatches A MACHETE
out of his belt CHICO shows concern but hes busy RETURNING FIRE at
THE ATTACKERS on the trawler

SARAH
I have to stop the infection Querrida

MIGUEL looks into SARAHS eyes He has started to tremble A cry of
primal panic is gurgling up in his throat With a sudden move SARAH
slams her RIFLE BUTT into the side of his head with all her might He
reels backwards and slams into the boathouse wall His eyes roll but
he stays on his feet still conscious

CHICO steps away from his post and stands squarely in front of
MIGUEL WHAP He slugs him with a powerhouse right-cross MIGUEL
still stands WHAP He slugs him again WHAP Again Finally MIGUEL
collapses into the mans arms and CHICO lays the limp body down on
the deck

BUDDABLAM RATTATATTATATTATATT THE ENEMY sensing an upper hand
starts FIRING WITH MORE INTENSITY CHICO steps away from MIGUEL and
SENDS SOME LEAD BACK their way

22 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

SARAH is crying Its not weakness Shes crying for MIGUEL crying
for his pain But she doesnt hesitate in what she has to do She
crouches over the BITTEN ARM and raises the MACHETE over her head

THUCK SHE CHOPS AT THE ELBOW JOINT with all her strength THE BLADE
BITES DEEP BUT DOESNT CUT THROUGH SHE LIFTS IT AND CHOPS AGAIN AND
AGAINTHUCK THUCK Then SHE DIGS AROUND searching for the joint
the way she might on a turkey drumstick Finding the spot SHE PUSHES
DOWN WITH BOTH HANDS leaning all her weight on the top edge of the
blade TEARS are running down her cheeks when THE BIG KNIFE
FINALLY THUMMMPPPCUTS THROUGH TO THE DECKING

Repulsed angry SARAH SWEEPS THE SEVERED FOREARM AWAY WITH THE BLADE
the way a butcher might sweep away unwanted fat BLOOD IS SPURTING
OUT OF THE STUMP at an alarming rate SARAH has to act quickly again

While CHICO continues to RETURN FIRE at the enemy SARAH swings
herself up onto the sill of the open boathouse window and disappears
inside the place

23 INT THE BOATHOUSE - DAY

The place is dark and cluttered (oars bait buckets fishing gear
life preservers tools paints varnishes) SARAH snatches up AN AXE
HANDLE

THE ZOMBIE that bit Miguel lies nearby with its skull laid open Its
hand is jogged startingly when SARAH grabs A BOTTLE OF PAINT
THINNER from the floor beside the corpse

From out of the shadowsA HAND It grabs SARAHS ankle She kicks
violently and pulls away ANOTHER ZOMBIE is crawling across the
floor ONE OF ITS LEGS IS MISSING AND THE OTHER IS BADLY DAMAGED

SARAH draws her 45 and BULLAMM BULLAMM SHE PUMPS TWO ROUNDS INTO
THE CREATURES BRAIN

24 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY
CHICO ducks the enemys RICOCHETING BULLETS

CHICO

HEY WHAT ARE WE DOIN THIS FOR WE CAN
STICK TOGETHER WE CAN USE EACH OTHERS
GUNS

At THE TRAWLER ONE OF THE ATTACKERS shouts a response

ATTACKER 1

You could use our guns maybe We cant use
yours Unless you can get yer boat back
here

CHICO
You got a boat

ATTACKER 1
Shit man We can drift this tub into the
baytow her around with a dinghybut
she aint gonna get us nowhere Evry boat

back here

CHICO
I dont know where they went man I dont
now I swear

ATTACKER 1

Then like I saidwe cant use you We
aint got the food nor the patience to put
up with you

The man FIRES A LONG BURST from his automatic

CHICO
YOU YOU MOTHERFUCKERS

He reaches around the corner of the shed with his own rifle and FIRES
blind in return SARAH clambers out through the shed windows having
wrapped A LARGE PIECE OF CLOTH around the end of the AXE HANDLE

She reaches into a shirt pocket and produces A WOODEN MATCH She
strikes the match and touches the flame to the thinner-soaked cloth
PHOOOOOMPH The axe handle becomes an angrily flaming torch

25 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

As the gun battle continues SARAH crouches over MIGUEL BLOOD IS
STILL FOUNTAINING FROM THE STUMP OF HIS LEFT ARM The woman slaps THE
FLAMING END OF HER TORCH ONTO THE STUMP Theres A SIZZLING SOUND as
the raw flesh there cooks

The pain reaches MIGUEL even though his unconscious state He starts
to breathe heavily His head shakes from side to side silently
pleading NO NO NO The flames do their job THE FLESH CRUSTS OVER
AND THE BLEEDING STOPS

MIGUELS SHIRT CATCHES Suddenly his eyes pop open and he screams
like the man on fire he is He lurches away from the flame his body
slamming against the shed wall SARAH flings the torch into the water
and dives on top of the man

SARAH
MIGUELITO MI VIDA MIGUEL MIO

MIGUEL trying to scream but needing to vomit is doing neither His
body is convulsing in the womans arms She rubs the sparks on his
shirt until they disappear then she caresses him holding his head
against hers rocking him back and forth
26 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

CHICO is still busy RETURNING FIRE BULLETS WHIZ through the air
around his head ONE KNICKS HIM ON THE SHOULDER a superficial but
painful wound

CHICO
JESUS CHRIST GET UP HERE WOMAN GET THE
HELL UP HERE

SARAH has no choice but to help in the fight She lays MIGUEL as
gently as she can on his back Hes gone into deep shock shivering
violently Rubbing tears away from her eyes SARAH jumps to her feet
takes up a post and begins to FIRE AT THE ATTACKERS

THE ATTACKERS are grinning like old-fashioned pirates as their GUNS
CHEW UP THE DOCK Suddenly just behind THE TRAWLER we see A FLASH
OF COLOUR SPEEDING BY

Its THE FISHING BOAT The WOUNDED MARIA is steering TONY is
standing on the prow with his RIFLE FIRING
RATTATATTATATTATATTATATT

ONE OF THE ATTACKERS IS HIT FROM BEHIND HIS BACK TURNS SOLID RED and
HE PITCHES FORWARDS FALLING between the boat and the dock into the
water below

THE OTHER ATTACKER turns and FIRES IN RESPONSE TONY IS HIT IN
THE STOMACH He falls to his knees and grabs the side of the boat but
he KEEPS FIRING

THE ATTACKER pivots against a mast For a moment he doesnt realise
that HIS NECK HAS BEEN RIPPED OPEN BY A LINE OF BULLETS He tries to
scream Cant A PLUME OF RED SHOOT OUT OF HIS MOUTH Then he
realises He realises that hes a dead man He falls

MARIA
TONYTONY

TONY
PULL IN GET THE OTHERS

TONY is clutching at his BLEEDING BELLY as MARIA in pain from her
own wound circles the boat towards the edge of the dock

27 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - DAY

Behind the boathouse SARAH slings her rifle onto her shoulder and
she leans over MIGUEL who is now catatonic

SARAH
Help me get him to the boat
CHICO
Leave him

SARAH calmly raises her 45 and aims it directly at CHICOs head

SARAH
Help me or die

Reluctantly the man moves towards MIGUEL and the two survivors drag
his limp body over the decking

DISSOLVE TO
28 EXT THE PRIVATE DOCK - SUNSET

The fishing boat is gone Orange light from the western horizon
paints the scene FIGURES are moving about on the dock slumped
lumbering figuresZOMBIES

Theyre clustering around THE TRAWLER around THE CORPSES OF THE
ATTACKERS

THEY BEGIN PULLING THOSE CORPSES APART AND EATING THEM HUNGRILY

ONE CREATURE has found MIGUELS SEVERED FOREARM IT PULLS A BIG CHUNK
OFF THE THING WITH ITS TEETH It chews for a time ITS DROOL TURNING
RED Then it spits out MIGUELS WRISTWATCH as though it was a
bothersome bit of bone

29 EXT THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - SUNSET

THE TWO WOMEN hover over their wounded TONY AND MIGUEL CHICO steers
the boat Suddenly TONY arches his back and screams in pain

TONY
Aaaaaaahmy Godmy GodI am heartily
sorryfor having offended

Theeoffended Thee

MARIA

ShhhhhTony Rest rest

TONY

I detest all my sinsbecause because
of Thy just punishment because of

Thyjustpunish

A coughing fit interrupts his Act of Contrition From across the open
cabin from within SARAHS arms MIGUEL stares His eyes have the
glaze of a madmans eyes Despite that and despite the physical
trauma he has endured he seems remarkably in command
MIGUEL
He is dying I will end his pain

MIGUEL draws his PISTOL

MARIA
NOOO0000000

TONY

but most of all becausethey offend
Thee my GodWho art all goodand
deservingdeserving of all my love

MIGUEL
He is dying He knows it

MARIA
You are dying too

MIGUEL
No The disease was cut away from me I
will live I will live

TONY

firmly resolvewith the with the
helpthe help ofof Thy grace
TONY collapses A long gurgling breath of surrender spills out of
him and BLOOD TRICKLES FROM HIS LIFELESS MOUTH

MARIA
TonyTONY
The woman folds TONYS corpse into her arms as though trying to give
it life from her own wounded body For a long moment there is only
the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the tired engine Then the woman sensing
something turns back towards MIGUEL His pistol is raised aimed at
TONYS head

MARIA
NO YOU CANT

SARAH
It must be done You know this It must by
done to keep him from

MARIA

It wont happen to him It wont happen to
him You heard his prayer His prayer will
save him He could never become one
ofone of those devils
MIGUEL

Prayers have no power to save The knife
can save It can cut the disease away The
bullet It can shatter the brain where the
evil takes seed These are savioursour

new savioursour only saviours

MARIA

We must wait One day the curse will pass
One day a dead man will will

MIGUEL

One day a dead man will refuse to return
and that man will be a saint The first
saint of our century Thats a prayer too
A catechism Something the priests tell us
to believe

MARIA

You can believe this Miguel Ill kill you
if you shoot We must wait IllIll do
itIll do it myselfwhen it needs to
be done

MIGUEL

No You wont be able to do it He will
rise He will rise and you you will die

That madmans glaze is wet in MIGUELS eyes again A grin curls his
mouth into an odd shape He freezes staring waiting SARAH shows
concern

30 EXT DEEP WATER (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - NIGHT

A CRESCENT MOON lies on its back Below on the pitch black water
its reflection a vertical stripe breaks open as THE BOAT passes
through itCHUG-CHUG-CHUG

31 EXT THE FISHING BOAT (IN DEEP WATER) - NIGHT

CHICO has fallen asleep at the tiller SARAH is asleep as well and
so is MARIA

A SILENT SHADOW moves over the side rail HANDS reach out and grip
MARIAS shoulders lifting her up up from sleep Her eyes flutter
open

TONYS face is blue-grey in the moonlight It takes the woman a
second or two to recognise that HE IS ONE OF THE LIVING DEAD His
hungry mouth lunges towards her neck His DROOLING TEETH SINK DEEP
The woman screams
SARAH wakes with a start MIGUEL is already awake Hes been watching
all along Now he watches still his PISTOL idle in his one good
hand his mouth curled in that strange grin as MARIAS screams
shatter the quiet night

At the tiller CHICO sees whats happening He fumbles for the
AUTOMATIC RIFLE thats strapped over his shoulder

A PORK-CHOP-SIZE CHUNK COMES OUT OF MARIAS NECK IN THE CLENCHED
TEETH OF THE TONY-CREATURE BLOOD SQUIRTS UPWARD IN A FIVE-FOOT ARC

SARAH lifts her RIFLE from her lap She is the first to FIRE An
instant later CHICO FIRES as well

THE HEAD ON THE TONY-CREATURE IS HIT BY RAPID-FIRE LOADS from each
gun and IT COME APART ABOVE THE EYES Its body staggers stiffly into
MARIA She tries to stand tries to pull away screams still bubbling
in her torn throat She topples backward over the side rail The
corpse taller and heavier flips rigidly over its feet kicking
skyward and splashes in to the deep black Gulf

MARIA the small of her back balanced precariously on the side rail
grabs at the air trying to swing her weight back on board SARAH
springs forward She reaches the other woman a second too late Their
hands brush but dont catch MARIA slips over the side A LOUD SPLASH
CUTS OFF HER SCREAMS

CHICO brings the boat about in as tight a circle as possible He and
SARAH stare out over the water The blackness out there is absolute
Visibility zero

Silencebut for the CHUG-CHUG-CHUG of the boats engine

MIGUEL slowly raises his hand and aims his PISTOL at a LARGE TURTLE-
SHAPED SPLOTCH OF BLOOD on the hull across the cabin the spot where
TONY died With that odd grin still on his lips HE BEGINS TO FIRE
one shot at a time in deliberate slow rhythm

THE BULLETS PUNCH HOLES through the wooden side-wall most of them
hitting squarely in the blood stain

SARAH looks over toward CHICO who returns her look with frightened
eyes

32 EXT GASPARILLAS ISLAND (EST) - DAY

It looks like a tropical paradise Greatly separated from the other
smaller islands on the horizon its vegetation is dense and lush
Theres no sign that civilisation ever invaded the place no power
lines no buildings What meets the eye is all natural and inviting
THE FISHING BOAT chugs into a tidewater basin on the afternoon side
of the island

33 EXT THE FISHING BOAT (IN THE BASIN) - DAY

CHICO
It looks uninhabited What do you think

MIGUEL

I think we should burn the church Kill the
priest and burn the church Its the only
way The only way

MIGUEL is sweating profusely yet shivering as though cold FLIES ARE
BUZZING in a cluster around his WRAPPED STUMP Hes over the edge
now insane And worse than that the infection from the original
bite is spreading The amputation was not done quickly enough to
prevent the parasites from racing through his veins to the brain and
elsewhere

SARAH turns towards the madman once her lover Her heart is too
callused for emotion to reach it She just stares her eyes dead cold
like the eyes of a shark

CHICO
Im pullin in

34 EXT THE ISLAND (WITH THE FISHING BOAT) - DAY

THE BOAT noses into a swamp water backwash Tall reeds and cypress
moss camouflage it completely Its at though the boat is sailing
right onto dry land

SHOCK CUT TO
35 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE INLET - DAY

THWOCK CLOSE ON A MACHETE The blade chops into the top of a
coconut

CHICO drinks the milk SARAH sits on a nearby rock her RIFLE AND A
BACK-PACK full of supplies strapped over her shoulders

MIGUEL his madmans eyes wide with excitement is trotting urgently
from spot to spot where a spectacular specie of sub-tropical plant
grows There are hundreds of them six-feet tall and flowering Their
red-gold blossoms are shaped like trumpets hanging with their bells
down

MIGUEL
DATURA DATURA MIRA DATURA
CHICO
Whats he saying

SARAH shrugs not knowing CHICO looks down at her empathising

CHICO

His madnesscould be from shock

SARAH

No I didnt stop the infection in time I
know

(She speaks softly matter-of-factly)
Dont worry When he dies I wont be like
Maria Ill shoot him

MIGUEL
DATURA DATURA DATURA METEL

36 EXT THE INLAND JUNGLE - DAY

THE GUERILLEROS hack their way through thick undergrowth with
MACHETES MIGUEL is ineffectual He lags behind the others who are
doing trailblazing THE SOUNDS OF WILDLIFE excited by the intruders
fill the close humid air sometimes beautiful sometimes grotesque
sometimes startling

37 EXT A SWAMPY AREA - DAY

ALLIGATORS lurk and SNAKES slither among the reeds A FOURTEEN FOOT
GATOR opens its jaws wide making a SOUND LIKE ESCAPING STEAM CHICO
draws his PISTOL but SARAH reaches out to grab his hand

SARAH
No No shooting Not until were sure were
alone on this island

MIGUEL
No No thank you No ice Straight up
please No ice Thank you

MIGUELS eyes roll up into his head His knees buckle SARAH grabs
him under the arms barely keeping from falling face first into the
muddy swamp water CHICO comes to help

38 EXT THE SWAMP - DAY

THE TWO drag MIGUEL to the edge of dry land They flop him onto his
back and SARAH puts her canteen to his lips

MIGUEL
NO ICE I SAID NOOOOO ICE
He slams his good hand against the canteen knocking it away It
plops into the marsh water its contents lost

MIGUEL
Burn the church Kill the priest and burn
the church Burn

His mouth keeps on shaping words but no sound comes out He squirms
for a moment then he seems to fall asleep

CHICO looks down at him Unable to help he moves off towards solid
ground and disappears in the thick brush After a time SARAH follows
after him

39 EXT THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO is at the edge of a clearing when SARAH reaches him His eyes
are wide frightened by what they see

In the ground before them theres AN ENORMOUS IRON PLATE fifty feet
by ten all painted in brown and green camouflage patterns

SARAH
What is it

CHICO
I dunno Landing pad for a helicopter I
dunno

Suddenly theres A GREAT RUMBLING like the giant gears and pistons
of a drawbridge being activated The iron plate shudders and starts
to move downward into the earth SARAH AND CHICO duck into the
nearby jungle

40 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

They take cover in a thicket both their GUNS up and ready OTHER
SOUNDS can be heard now clunking sounds of metal on metal and a few
heavy thuds There are also VOICES on the wind but their words are
indistinguishable

CHICO

Its some kind ofelevator There must

be something under the ground
heremaybemilitary

SARAH

Look

41 EXT THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR POV) - DAY

SEVERAL FIGURES are rising up in to view a dozen maybe fifteen
Details are obscured by FOREGROUND FOLIAGE but we can read helmets
heavy armaments packs utility belts The impression is of a ghostly
cadre of soldiers rising from hell

SARAH (oSs)
Jesus Christ

CHICO (oS)
It is military I dont believe it

42 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
What do we do Letem know were hereor
what

SARAH
Lets justwait a minute Get a better
look

She moves to another spot a few feet away CHICO follows
43 EXT THE CAVE ENTRANCE (THEIR POV) - DAY

THE PLATOON OF SOLDIERS still obscured by foliage moves off into
the jungle carrying A COLLECTION OF PARAPHERNALIA

There are THREE SOLDIERS who do not move off with the others They
are standing still with their shoulders slumped their heads lolling
listlessly from side to side They have the body attributes of
prisoners yet theres something menacing about them We HEAR A SERIES
OF ELECTRONIC BEEPS something like computer beeps and as though in
response to that signal the three slumped figures start to walk
They move slowly stiffly their feet shuffling their arms dangling
lifelessly at their sides

SARAH (oSs)
Ohoh my God
44 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

SARAHS eyes are wide in their sockets with disbelief revulsion
horror Beside her CHICO also astonished makes the sign of the
cross

SARAH
OH MY GOD
45 EXT THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

As we CUT IN CLOSER we see that the three slumped figures are
ZOMBIES They are wearing khakis and they are armed with RIFLES AND
STOL BELTS Their HELMETS have been painted an identifying bright
ED and they wear slipover vests dyed the same bright colour

D0

All the others in the platoon are humans They too wear vests but
theirs are not red but WHITE WITH LARGE ORANGE CIRCLES emblazoned
front and back Two of the men wield LONG ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS for
use should the ZOMBIES misbehave but the creatures amazingly are
shambling along with the rest of the platoon voluntarily co-
operatively even somewhat excitedlythe kind of excitement seen
in a puppy thats just learned a new trick

46 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CAVE ENTRANCE - DAY

CHICO
It cant be Are we truly in hell

SARAH
Come on

Stealthily the woman moves along the edge of the thicket crouching
all the while CHICO hesitantly follows

47 EXT A CLEARING - DAY

The mysterious PLATOON begins setting up their equipment which
includes TRIPOD MACHINE GUNS TWO MEN don BLACK RUBBER GLOVES AND
LONG BLACK LABORATORY APRONS They strap LARGE REFRIGERATED CARTONS
around their necks and open the sealed lids VAPOUR mushrooms out
like dry-ice vapour out of Good Humour wagons on a hot day

48 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH AND CHICO watch Suddenly THE HUGE FULL-THROATED SOUND OF A
SIREN startles them They look around up into the trees SARAH spots
something and points

CLOSE ON A SIREN HORN high in the cypresses its wires running down
to the brush and disappearing under ground

49 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

First ONE comesthen TWO MORETHREE MORE ZOMBIES are shuffling
out of the jungle and converging on the platoon

They seem to come from everywhere Soon there are twenty or more
Most are tattered and ragged but others wear vests the same type as
worn by the platoon These are solid colours some white some blue
None are red and none have orange circles

As THE ZOMBIES push in closer they seem to get agitated They start
growling and reaching out THE MEN WITH THE CATTLE PRODS poke at the
more unruly creatures and ZAPPING SOUNDS can be heard
The creatures form a kind of ragged queue lining up in front of the
Good Humour men From inside their freezer cartons those men
produce GREAT BLOODY CHUNKS OF RAW MEAT THE ZOMBIES docilely take
the hand-outs and go lurching out of the queue some starting to eat
immediately others retreating into the cool of the jungle to enjoy a
more private supper

50 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
SARAH
What is that Could that be

Behind her CHICO gets the dry heaves He slams his hand into his
mouth to keep from making noise

SARAH

No They must have gotten them to
acceptother things They wouldnt be
feeding them withthey wouldnt

51 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

The man in command of the platoon is obvious strutting around while
others do the dirty work This is CAPTAIN RHODES Hes
conscienceless the low of the low and a weasely-looking guy to
boot He watches the operation almost hoping for trouble (He loves
to torture disobedient zombies)

Behind him their AUTOMATICS ready are SEVERAL TROOPERS especially
assigned to protect the captain One of these troopers is TOBY TYLER
a good guy TOBY is revulsed by the scene in the clearing He drops
his head almost gagging RHODES notices

RHODES

Youll get used to this Tyler Its the
only way They dont bite the hand that
feeds

TOBY looks up He cant conceal his contempt for the captain RHODES
reads it in his eyes and is about to say something when a SOUND
distracts him

ONE OF THE RAG-TAG ZOMBIES is running amok THE ZAPPERS poke at the
creature but that just makes it angrier

RHODES
GET THAT THING AWAY FROM THE OTHERS
BRING IT HERE

ONE TROOPER has A LONG POLE WITH A WIRE NOOSE ON THE END He drops
the noose over the wild zombies head and the wire tightens biting
into the dead flesh on the things neck The pole is long enough to
control the creature while keeping it out of reach

52 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH watches repulsed but fascinated CHICO is still fighting the
heaves Without warning A ZOMBIE looms up directly behind CHICO The
man jumps forward terrified He crashes into SARAH who spins and
sees the danger

TWO MORE ZOMBIES appear Then A THIRD These have no vests Theyre
rag-tag bad ass and hungry as hell ONE OF THEM grabs SARAH She
manages to pull away but behind her CHICO panics He raises his RIFLE
andRATTATATTATATT

53 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY
RHODES hears the GUNFIRE He seems pleased He grins

RHODES
We have visitors Lets go men

He moves slowly towards the thicket followed by TOBY TYLER AND
SEVERAL OTHER SOLDIERS He reaches down to his belt and pushes one of
THREE BUTTONS on A UNIT that resembles a pager ELECTRONIC BEEPS
like the ones we heard earlier come from the unit this time ina
different pattern

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES respond quickly They draw their PISTOLS and go
marching off after their leader grunting and snorting like bull
apes RHODES grin breaks into a wide-open laugh

RHODES

Hah If only the rest of you ladies would

obey orders the way they do

54 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

Their cover blown SARAH now raises her RIFLE BUDDABUDDA

THE SECOND ZOMBIES HEAD TURNS TO RED PULP and the thing pitches
forward dead

CHICO FIRES and THE THIRD ZOMBIE IS DESTROYED

Suddenly there is DISTANT FIRE from the clearing BULLETS WHIZ
through the brush The guerilleros duck for cover

55 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

THE RED COAT ZOMBIES shuffling forward abreast in a line have
OPENED FIRE Its a grisly parody of foot-soldiering The creatures

are unsteady on their feet their hands shake when they squeeze the
stiff Army-issue triggers BULLETS FLY this way and that most of
them grossly off target

RHODES

THATS IT YOU WORM-EATEN SLIME YOU FOUL-
SMELLING PUSS-FACED MAGGOTS I TOLD YOU
ID FIND YOU REAL ACTION DIDNT I YOU
CORRUPTION YOU FILTH YOURE LEARNING
YOURE GETTING BETTER GETTING
BETTERGETTING BETTER YOU SCUM

The trooper beside TOBY is another young man whose nickname is
TRICKS He and TOBY exchange glances as they trudge along behind the
captain and his zombie red coats Their eyes tell us that they both
think Rhodes to be insane which of course he is

56 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH moves to retreat but CHICO lifts his rifle and FIRES wildly
into the clearing

CHICO
NO NOOOOO NOOOOOOOOCOOOCOON

57 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

TWO OF THE RED COATS ARE HIT but not in the head Their brains keep
functioning and they march on

RHODES
SPREAD OUT MEN OPEN FIRE

Whatever else he is RHODES seems fearless He stands in the open as
his human soldiers fan out He notices that the RED COATS are out of
ammunition He pushes another button on his belt unit and MORE BEEPS
SOUND THE RED COATS stop in their tracks They dump the SPENT SHELLS
from their weapons and reload using fresh rounds from their belts
Their fingers are stiff Three bullets fall to the ground for every
one that finds its way into a gun chamber

The SOLDIERS HAVE OPENED FIRE NOW They are closing in on the
thicket

58 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
CHICO IS HIT high on the right side of his chest SARAH FIRES A QUICK

BURST out into the clearing as she tries to pull the man deeper into
the jungle

Suddenly from right behind SARAHs back comes A BLOOD CURDLING
SCREAM A DARK FIGURE LOOMS UP startling us all
MIGUEL
BURN THE CHURCH KILL THE PRIEST

Its MIGUEL sweating his eyes sunken into deep black sockets He is
charging toward the clearing with his AUTOMATIC BLAZING in his one
good hand He thunders right past SARAH almost knocking her down

59 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

MIGUEL breaks out of the thicket into clear view of the SOLDIERS
RHODES sees the one-armed wild man and his grin dissipated slightly
He draws his own PISTOL an enormous Magnum an elephant stopper

SOLDIERS taken by surprise scatter TOBY AND TRICKS among them
MIGUELS BULLETS DRAW A LINE ACROSS ONE SOLDIERS CHEST He dies
instantly

MIGUEL
KILL THE PRIEST BURN THE CHURCH
BURN BURN BURN BURN BURN

NOW MIGUEL IS HIT but he keeps coming his GUN SPITTING
ANOTHER SOLDIER goes down HIT IN THE MID SECTION
THE PLATOON RETURNS FIRE

MIGUEL IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE CHEST He falls to his knees His RIFLE
FIRES A LINE OF BULLETS INTO THE EARTH and the kicking of the gun
knocks him back on his ass He sits there bewildered for a moment
then he looks up to find himself directly facing CAPTAIN RHODES

RHODES lifts his MAGNUM but MIGUEL is faster with his RIFLE In the
next instant the muzzle is aiming straight for the captains stomach
RHODES smile disappears re-placed by a sudden flush of fear He
freezes

MIGUEL
Kill the priest

MIGUEL squeezes the trigger and his weapon CLICKS sharply Its
empty

The captains smile slowly returns He pushes the Attack button on
his belt unit

THE RED COATS advance their PISTOLS reloaded THEY FIRE stiff-armed
and fumble-fingered at MIGUEL He sees them moving towards him
Something in his mind clicks and he recognises the creatures for what
they arewalking dead
THE FIRST FEW BULLETS MISS Then ONE HITS HIM IN HIS STUMP and
reality gets even clearer He starts to scream

THE READ COATS walk closer their dead eyes showing enjoyment of the
sport BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM

ANOTHER ROUND HITS MIGUEL IN THE STOMACH ANOTHER CREASES HIS HEAD
He tries to stand up but hes too weak A BULLET IN THE NECK stops

his screaming Then HES HIT IN THE HEART A BALL OF BLOOD PROJECTS
OUT OF HIS MOUTH and he plops onto his back dead

THE READ COATS KEEP FIRING until their guns are empty again RHODES
calmly pushes the Reload signal and the creatures obey

MIGUELS CORPSE twitches for a short time then goes rigid
60 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY
SARAH sinks against a cypress when she sees MIGUEL die

CHICO in a state of blind panic takes off along the edge of the
thicket his WOUND BLEEDING PROFUSELY

61 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO breaks through some brush to find himself face-to-face with
TOBY TYLERS GROUP OF SOLDIERS He stops reverses course and ducks
into a cluster of palms ONE OF THE SOLDIERS FIRES
RATTATATTATATTATATT

BULLETS RIP THE PALM FRONDS APART Theres a scream and CHICO
somersaults out into view NEW WOUNDS BLEEDING ACROSS THE CENTER OF
HIS CHEST

62 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

SARAH realises that this is her last chance to escape She takes
advantage of the confusion and the NOISE and bolts into the jungle at
a full run

63 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CHICO is still alive He fumbles for his HOLSTERED PISTOL but before
he can draw it THREE TROOPERS are on top of him TRICKS tromps a boot
on his hand TOBY TYLER aims his RIFLE squarely at his sweating brow

CHICO

Yesyes do itpleaseyou cant let
me die this wayplease Destroy me A
bulletin the headI dont want to
becomeone ofone of them
TOBY looks down at the man at his TERRIBLE WOUNDS clearly fatal
ones TOBY clicks a shell into the firing chamber of his RIFLE His
finger is just sliding under the trigger shield when CAPTAIN RHODES
strides up behind him

RHODES
Take his weapon Tyler

TOBY is startled by the voice at his back He turns towards the
captain then he looks back down at the guerillero hesitating

RHODES
Take his gun ass hole He still has the
strength to pull a trigger

Reluctantly TOBY obeys reaches down for CHICOS PISTOL
CHICO

Pleasesenordestroy meone

RHODES

Maybe Well have a little talk first
ThenmaybeI can help you out String
him up

THE THIRD SOLDIER reaches down and grabs the wounded guerillero under
the arms TRICKS stoops to help CHICO screams in agony when he is
moved TOBY lunges in to help the others thinking to ease the mans
pain

RHODES

They can handle it Tyler Youve been
buckin for a shit detail lately so heres
one youre gonna love Weve got two dead
Cut the heads off and get the bodies
underground to the refrigerators Fast
Its a hot day

TOBY grimaces but doesnt speak He turns and moves briskly towards
the clearing RHODES watches him go

64 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY nears the spot where MIGUEL lies sprawled in A POOL OF BLOOD
RHODES calls from the edge of the thicket

RHODES
Tyler Just our men Not him

TOBY looks down at the remains of the one-armed guerillero
RHODES

His head stays where it is He and I never
really had the chance to get acquainted
When he comes backIll get another shot
at it Ha ha ha ha

65 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON CHICO Hes dangling from A ROPE which is tied over a tall
tree his feet ten feet off the ground

ZOMBIES wander here and there Theyve all received their rations
The picnic is breaking up now Occasionally one of them gets surly
but it doesnt amount to anything SOLDIERS stand ready with ELECTRIC
PRODS OTHERS with GUNS

PARAPHERNALIA is being packed away MEN CARRY EQUIPMENT in the
direction of the elevator

RHODES walks up beneath where CHICO is hanging Hes careful not to
step in too close He doesnt want to get any DRIPPING BLOOD on his
uniform

CHICO
Pleaseshoot me

RHODES

And if I dont If I dont youll come back
after your death Youll come back and find

ultimate sin for most of you fools isnt

CHICO is weeping now With a found spurt of energy he struggles
against the rope No use It only brings pain

RHODES

After hanging up there a few days you will
be mad for foodcrazed You will lust for
it YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM

CHICO

The man collapses unconscious
66 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE ON THE DISEMBODIED HEAD OF ONE OF THE DEAD SOLDIERS TRICKS is
dropping the thing into A LARGE PLASTIC BAG which obviously already
contains THE SECOND HEAD TOBY wraps the mouth of the bag and begins
to walk off RHODES stops him

RHODES
Where are you going Tyler

TOBY
Mydetail sir Were going to bury the
heads

RHODES
No time for that Ill take care of them

TOBY
Justfollowing procedure sir Theyre
entitled to burial

RHODES

I said Ill take care of them Just leave
them there Go help with the rest of the
gear

RHODES has it in for TOBY (well find out why later) and of course
the feeling is mutual TOBY sets the bag down on the ground and
seething he trots off towards the rest of the platoon TRICKS
follows

After a moment RHODES motions with his head THE SOLDIER WITH THE
LONG NOOSE POLE steps into view with the CAPTIVE ZOMBIE the one that
ran amok earlier The man follows RHODES towards the jungle dragging
the gurgling creature along the wire noose digging into the things
neck

67 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

CLOSE as RHODES GLOVED HAND jams A HAND GRENADE into THE CAPTIVE
ZOMBIES gaping mouth THE SOLDIER WITH THE POLE releases the noose
and the two men take off running

68 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

They run to the middle of the clearing where they turn around to
watch RHODES lifts A PAIR OF BINOCULARS that are strapped around his
neck He stares through the lenses focusing grinning

69 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

THROUGH THE BINOCULARS We see THE ZOMBIE staggering in the bush
clawing desperately at the thing jammed in its mouth

70 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY

TOBY AND TRICKS are the only ones who seem to notice what RHODES has
done TOBY drops THE CRATE he was going to carry off He stares in
disbelief hatred on his face

71 EXT THE JUNGLE NEAR THE CLEARING - DAY

WIDE SHOT as THE HEAD OF THE ZOMBIE DISINTEGRATES WHEN THE GRENADE
EXPLODES
72 EXT THE CLEARING - DAY
RHODES grins as he watches the spectacle

Suddenly A LOUD GUNSHOT startles the captain He drops the
binoculars and spins around He sees

CHICOS BODY DANGLING ON THE ROPE CHICOS HEAD IS BLOODY Hes
deadand wont come back to life Hes been shot through the brain

RHODES
WHO FIRED THAT SHOT WHO FIRED THAT SHOT

SOLDIERS stand around dumbly Those with RIFLES in their hands
quickly sling them onto their shoulders Theyre all afraid of the
captains wrath RHODES walks towards the line of men with fury in
his eyes

RHODES

Goddammit somebodys gonna tell me who
fired that shot or Ill have every last one
of you chopped up for feed

His eyes spot TOBY standing behind the crate he dropped earlier his
rifle slung

RHODES
Step up here Tyler

TOBY
Sir

TOBY shouts the word like a West Point cadet and he bravely steps
forward RHODES stares him down his anger turning sinister

RHODES
You fired that shot didnt you

TOBY
No sir

RHODES
Let me see your weapon

TOBY hands over his rifle RHODES feels the barrel sniffs it

RHODES
Its been fired

TOBY
In the battle sir
RHODES is sure hes found the guilty man and hes glad it turned out
to be his favourite whipping boy His body relaxes visibly

RHODES

It may be that none of these chicken-shits
will talk while the whole troop is
presentbut I know some of these men
well Im sure that a few private
conversations will tell me what I already
know You may have earned yourself some
time in the Stalag Tyler

(Rhodes glances over at CHICOS body)

Cut him down Thats another head for you
to chop off Leave it with the others Take
the rest of his body down to the freezers
Move it shit hill

TOBY moves off RHODES grin returns
CUT TO
73 INT THE CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

Theres that GIANT SOUND again the RUMBLE OF THE ELEVATOR Were
inside the place called THE CAVE in a huge under-ground concrete
bunker TECHNICIANS AND ARMED GUARDS bustle around Enormous
hydraulic pistons are bringing the camouflaged iron plate down from
the surface Riding on board RHODES AND HIS PLATOON prepare to
unload their paraphernalia

74 EXT THE JUNGLE - EVENING

SARAH sweating exhausted BLEEDING FROM CUTS made by jungle
branches wrings out a piece of cloth torn from her sleeve She has
dipped it into a jungle stream Cautiously she tastes the water
decides to chance it and squeezes the cloth into her mouth

The NIGHT BIRDS suddenly stop their singing and the quiet makes SARAH
look up Standing across the stream only ten feet away is A
PARTICULARLY GROTESQUE ZOMBIE VULTURES stand on the marshy ground
beside the creatures legs THEIR SHARP BEAKS PICKING BLOODY HOLES IN
ITS ANKLES AND FEET

SARAH jumps to her feet fighting back exhaustion one more time She
unslings her RIFLE aims it then thinks better of firing Grabbing
up her SUPPLY PACK she runs into the darkening jungle

75 EXT THE JUNGLE - EVENING

WHAM TWO BIG HANDS GRAB SARAH by her shoulders She starts to scream
but one of those hands shoots up to cover her mouth
JOHN
Its alright Its alright Dont be
afraid Were friends

SARAH looks into the strong good face of JOHN a tall muscular man
a Caribbean Islander with shiny black skin and enormous brown eyes
that seem instantly trustworthy

JOHN
There are soldiers near here Guards Ill
take my hand away if you wont scream

SARAH nods and JOHN lets her go There are two other humans standing
behind the big man Theres BILL McDERMOTT wearing the grease-
covered jump-suit of a mechanic and swilling generous shots of brandy
from a hip flask and theres a smallish woman with a sensitive face
who apparently out of character is armed to the teeth Shes a deaf
mute nicknamed SPIDER and she is urgently signing Come on Lets
get outa here with her hands

JOHN
Right We better get away from that Bee He
might have friends

THE GROUP starts moving SARAH follows voluntarily We notice that
all three strangers are wearing the same pullover vests that we saw
on the foot soldiers the ones with big orange circles

76 EXT THE JUNGLE - EVENING

THE GROUP trudges through thick brushland occasionally needing to
chop a path with their blades JOHN speaks in low tones as they move

JOHN
Bees Thats what we call the dead the
walking deadhere on Gasparillas island

SARAH

JOHN

He was a pirate who sailed these waters

SPIDER is signing for everyone to be qui

Mohican SPIDER pushes aside the branches
peers through

77 EXT ENTRANCE TWO - EVENING

Theres A HATCHWAY in sight built into A
STRUCTURE FOUR OR FIVE SOLDIERS are com
Theyre armed with PRODS AND RIFLES

Behind the men lurching on unsteady fee
LIVING DEAD all wearing vests of white

white laboratory coats and carrying clip
HENRIED one of the top behaviouralists
lot more about her later)

THE ZOMBIES are pushing through the unde
direction of SARAH and her friends SARA
but JOHN calms her with a strong hand

SPIDER has seen the approaching danger

Behind the lumbering creatures come A WOMAN AND A MAN both wearing

boards The woman is MARY
in The Cave (Well learn a

rgrowth right in the
H shows some alarm at this

She silently draws A FARMERS
nd she draws A PISTOL for
ervously takes another
THE ZOMBIES are getting closer Too close for comfort

Finally MARY HENRIED and THE OTHERS turn and disappear into the
bunker The last man down pulls the hatch shut

The moment the coast is clear SPIDER AND JOHN jump up from cover
THE OTHERS follow their lead But its too late THE ZOMBIES have
spotted them The creatures begin to growl and make AGITATED APE-
LIKE SOUNDS SPIDER brings her BLADE up chest-high ready to repel an
attack SARAH lifts her own MACHETE but JOHN reaches over and takes
it away from her

JOHN
Give that to me Get behind me Stay behind
me

(SARAH resists not understanding somewhat
insulted)

You aint wearin a vest They been taught
not to touch the ones with the circles
There aint no hundred percent all-a-time
rules with the Bees but most-a-time they
leave us alone The colour on their vests
tell ya how much schoolin they got Its
the ones without colours you gotta watch
out for

SARAH gets behind JOHN his orange circle acting as her shield He
reaches around with one strong arm and pulls her in tight against his
back

THE ZOMBIES snarling and showing teeth move through the thicket
ONE shuffles right past SPIDER AND McDERMOTT It gets stuck in the
bramble changes course and moves on without attacking

ANOTHER ZOMBIE a white trudges within arms reach of JOHN
growling all the while Suddenly it reaches its arms out and takes
two angry steps towards the humans who back away

THE ZOMBIES charges Things happen quickly JOHN pushes SARAH away
and swings the MACHETE THE BLADE SINKS INTO THE CREATURES SKULL
BLACKENED BLOOD FLIES An instant later SPIDERS SICKLE PUNCHES IN
BESIDE THE BIG KNIFE THE ZOMBIE twitches for a moment its eyes
rolling then it falls lifeless to the ground

McDERMOTT trots up beside SARAH He takes a huge swallow from his
flask then offers some to her She puts the flask to her lips but
nothing comes She holds it out neck down to show that its empty

McDERMOTT
Sorry Guess I dont know my own strength

JOHN wipes SARAHS MACHETE on some thick leaves cleaning off most of
the gore then he returns the weapon to the woman

SARAH
Thanks I can fight my own battles

JOHN
I know you can Like I said we been
watchin you

McDERMOTT

We better get as far away from here as we
can We can work the other side of the
island tonight

JOHN

(explaining) We found nine entrances to the
Cave so far and we aint got the whole
thing near charted yet Thats what we was
doin out here today Huntin for
entrances

McDERMOTT

Come on They find a Bee done like this and
theyll know somebodys been out walkin
where they shouldnt have been

JOHN bows his head over the downed ZOMBIE He mumbles softly We
cant hear the words but we can tell that hes praying reciting the
good words over the corpse of the white-coat

SARAH

The man I was withuntil today
believed that praying was for blind men who
couldnt see the truth

JOHN
How we gonna break the curse without a
prayer or two

SARAH
Curse

JOHN
What is it if it aint a curse

SARAH
Its a disease Its aa buga parasite
that infects the brain
JOHN
That sounds like a curse to me

SARAH

We thought we were escaping here We
thought wed found an uninhabited island
Christ This place is a worse nightmare
than anything Ive seen yet

JOHN

Im sure thats true miss And thats why

happenin underground here is just what
Lucifer planned for this sinful race o
man But were gonna beat Lucifer Were
gonna put an end to whats happenin here

SARAH

Oh what did I run into A bunch o Jesus

bullet from one of those storm troopers and
prayer wont keep one of those monsters
from eatin your liver for lunch

JOHN

Thats why we didnt use prayers on this

destroyed We ready to fight when we have
to And we gotta fight now

SARAH

years and Im finished I dont need

couple guns and a couple hands We can sail
on outa here Find another island where
there aint so muchtraffic

JOHN

You think you can find your boat Theres a
thousand little inlets and backwaters all
through here You remember all the ways you
turned to get where you are now You leave
yourself a trail

SARAH is stopped by this She stares at the big man suspiciously
sure whether to believe him

JOHN
We didnt see the exact spot but we know
about where you landed But we aint ready

not
to take you there Not yet You seewe
need guns too

SARAH looks around her at the unlikely band of guerillas She thinks
for a momentnot very longthen she turns and starts off into the
jungle

SARAH
I can find it myself I didnt come that
far

JOHN

Farther than you think Youll get lost
You will And theres Bees all through the
jungle I aint lyin to ya Religiosos

SARAH
No They just try to hold you for ransom
Fuck you Moses Im outa here

SARAH plunges into the brush and without so much as a look back over
her shoulder she disappears

McDERMOTT
We cant let her go John

JOHN
We dont need her guns that bad Billy boy
(Hes joking)

McDERMOTT

The hell we dont But thats not what I
mean Shell be dead in ten minutes out

JOHN

Well split up Billy you go with Spider
Just an hour or two tonight thats all
Rhodes might have extra guards on after all
the commotion Well meet up at number six
and go back home together

McDERMOTT
God save us And me with me flask dry Ill
never make it

THE GROUP splits up moving off in two different directions through
the darkening underbrush

78 EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE - NIGHT
DARKNESS has fallen The jungle is as black as the background on a
velvet painting

SARAH is moving cautiously She bumps into something jumps back her
MACHETE high and freezes Cautiously she moves aheadone
stepanotheranother

SPLASH She steps down off a hidden ledge into A KNEE-DEEP RIVER
She manages to keep her balance but her MACHETE falls into the water
and drops to the bottom invisible in the dark silt Slowly she bends
down and reaches into the water A SNAKE swims past just inches away
SARAH recoils Before she can reach down again she hears A LOUD
ANIMAL SNORT followed by A GREAT SPLASHING SOUND Then ANOTHER She
squints to see

SHAPES approach on the black water ALLIGATORS big ones just their
very tops showing as they move on a straight course toward the woman

She backs up feeling for the shore for the ledge behind her THE
FIRST ZOMBIE GRABS HER SHOULDERS She spins and sees the thing It
has one eye dangling out of its socket and theres a broken-off
length of wooden pole stuck clean through its torso just under the
left breast

SARAH smashes her RIFLE BUTT INTO THE THINGS HEAD AGAIN AGAIN It
keeps coming (So do the gators Theyre getting to within a few
yards) SARAH swings a fourth time THE ZOMBIE grabs her rifle She
pulls with all her might and the creature hanging on to the gun
topples off the ledge and into the water

When SARAH starts to climb up on the ledge ANOTHER ZOMBIE lurches
towards her from dry land She spins around looking for options The
gators are just about close enough to bite her ass and THE ZOMBIE
that fell into the river is rising up again covered with moss and
slime and looking pissed

SARAH faces THE ZOMBIE on the bank She has no choice She aims her
AUTOMATIC Shes just about to fire when SOMETHING FLASHES out of the
darkness Its A MACHETE IT CLEAVES OPEN THE ZOMBIES SKULL From
out of the night big JOHN appears He struggles to free his blade
from the dead creatures head

SARAH scrambles up onto the muddy ledge THE GATORS are still moving
in and THE ZOMBIE its moss-covered arms reaching out rigidly like
the arms of Frankensteins monster is growling ferociously (almost
swallowing its own dangling eyeball in the process)

SARAH
Are you gonna pause to say words over the
dead this time or can we be on our way
Without answering JOHN steams off through the bush pulling SARAH
along behind him his big hand tight around her arm

719 INT THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE on A TELEVISION SCREEN First there is only VIDEO NOISE then
an image blinks onto the screen

MONTAGE OTHER VIDEO SCREENS on MONITORS in various places throughout
the huge underground facility ZOMBIES watch the screens gathered in
groups of four six and eight like children in ranked classes

The screens show scenes of ZOMBIES taking FOOD from humans in ORANGE
CIRCLE VESTS GUNS are pointed at ORANGE CIRCLES then lowered
harmlessly GUNS are pointed at HUMANS without orange circles and
FIRED The images repeat and repeat and repeat THE ZOMBIES watch the
scenes with dumb curiosity

80 INT COMMUNICATION CENTER IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

This is the central area for all varieties of communication There
are RADIO CONSOLES both intercom and outgoing there are VIDEO
CONTROL PANELS and there are LARGE COMPUTER TERMINALS Reflecting the
panic to set up operations back when the disaster first struck much
of the equipment is placed haphazardly and not built in WIRES run
every which way BARE ANTENNAS AND LOOSE CONNECTORS clutter the
place ENGINEERS scurry with TOOL BOXES constantly repairing
patching trouble shooting

Most of the personnel are TECHNICIANS but there is a group of
SCIENTIFIC TYPES obvious in their white lab coats Among these is
MARY HENRIED who we caught a glimpse of outside Entrance Two

At A SECURITY STATION A GUARD notices something on one of his own
VIDEO SCREENS which monitor key locations inside The Cave

GUARD
Theres activity in the dormitory

MARY and one of her assistants JULIE GRANT a younger girl move
over to the video console ONE SCREEN there shows what looks like a
prison corridor CELLS WITH HEAVILY BARRED DOORS run down both sides
We can see the distinct MOVEMENT OF SHADOWS in the corridor MARY
reacts instantly stepping over to AN INTERCOM and pressing A SEND-
BUTTON

VOICE (os - filter)
Gate twenty-three

MARY
This is Mary Henried Did anyone enter the
dormitory
VOICE (os - filter)
Yes mam Captain Rhodes

MARY clicks off infuriated She hurries towards AN EXIT followed by
JULIE GRANT

81 INT THE DORMITORY IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE MOUTH OF A LARGE PLASTIC BAG A HAND wearing A BLACK
LEATHER GLOVE pulls A HUMAN HEAD out of a bag by its hair Its the
head of one of the dead soldiers from Rhodes platoon The hand
belongs to RHODES himself

In the darkness of A CELL A RED COAT ZOMBIES takes a hesitant step
forward RHODES tries to shove THE HEAD through the bars but IT
STICKS When RHODES lets go it stays there wedged at shoulder
height

RHODES
Take it friend Take it Its a present
From me to you

THE RED COAT steps forward and lays its hand on THE HEAD

RHODES
Just remember who gives you favours

THE ZOMBIE pulls hard and THE HEAD pops through onto its side of the
bars The creature lurches off towards A COT in the shadows at the
rear of the cell where it hunkers down and begins to RAVISH THE HEAD
TEARING FLESH OFF EATING IT hungrily

On the cell door we notice A PLAQUE with a number and written in
marker the Red Coats nickname BLUTO

RHODES moves past OTHER CELLS each holding A NICKNAMED RED COAT
GRUMPY stands way back in the shadows TONTO stands near the bars
growling FATSO is swaying back and forth like a chubby five year old
who needs to pee

RHODES stops at A CELL marked BUB Inside we see A SILHOUETTE
tall erect not moving a muscle RHODES grins

RHODES
Well Bub Ive heard about you Miss
Henrieds pride and joy

RHODES steps closer and BUB snarls warningly

RHODES
Surly sonofabitch I want to make friends
Bub Friends I have one more goodie in my
sack here

A LOUD CLANGING SOUND interrupts RHODES turns to see
82 INT THE DORMITORY - NIGHT

MARY HENRIED AND JULIE GRANT have entered through A STEEL DOOR WITH
ELECTRONIC LOCKS THE ZOMBIES send up A CHORUS OF MOANS AND GROWLS
The women start down the corridor checking cells as they pass
Suddenly they stop in their tracks their horrified eyes staring into
A CELL marked SAMSON

SAMSON is nibbling on ANOTHER HEAD Much of the flesh is already
gone but we can still recogniseCHICO The zombie turns the thing
up-side-down reaches way inside through the neck and pulls out
grey matter

JULIE backs away fighting nausea A spasm rises in MARYS stomach as
well and she reels away from the hideous sight

RHODES
Come come Miss Science Youve seen
worse

MARY
Goddamn you Rhodes

RHODES
God has damned us all Are my atrocities
worse than yours

MARY

You have ruined weeks of work here Weve
been trying to wean these specimens onto
alligator meat

RHODES
No wonder theyre sohungry

Suddenly JULIE SCREAMS her hands flying to her mouth

THE PLASTIC BAG is still dangling from RHODES GLOVED HAND Inside
pressed into the thin plastic we can see the rough outline of THE
FINAL HEAD THE THING IS SQUIRMING causing the whole bag to wiggle

RHODES drops the bag instantly to the floor Taking care he grabs
the bottom by a loose corner and pulls up hard THE HEAD ROLLS OUT
AND SETTLES AGAINST A WALL ITS EYES ARE OPEN AND DARTING CRAZILY
ITS MOUTH IS CHEWING GROTESQUELY ON THE AIR

MARY stares in shock JULIE runs towards the exit trying to scream
but gagging on her own acids Shes hysterical

RHODES calmly draws his PISTOL cocks and FIRES THE SQUIRMING HEAD
IS SHATTERED by the powerful bullet

83 INT MARYS OFFICE IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

A 9 BY 12 CUBICLE with A SMALL COMPUTER TERMINAL A DESK AND THREE
CHAIRS Theres A LIGHTBOX on the wall displaying GROUPS OF CRANIAL
X-RAYS

MARY guides JULIE GRANT into a chair RHODES stands cockily in the
open doorway

JULIE
I didnt realise Those were de-caps I
didnt know thatde-caps revived

RHODES
Any dead whose brains are intact will
revive

JULIE
Butwe bury the heads Oh God It must
be torture for them

RHODES

They are brutes without feeling Though I
admit that Ive requested cremation for
myself Burial is an archaic tradition
even more ridiculous now than it ever was
To say nothing of thespacing
problemon a small island like this

JULIE
thought the purpose of decapitation was
toto

RHODES
The purpose of decapitation is to preserve
as muchfoodas possible The purpose
for feeding is to keep the beasts on our
side The fact that they can be taught to
clean up our garbage or to fire a gun isa
convenient side benefit not the primary
goal The primary goal is to keep ourselves
from becoming their supper Keep them fed
and they behave Keep them hungry and they
revert back to being the animals that they
have always been You saw them in there

MARY
You gave them a fresh taste of blood

RHODES

They will never be satisfied with anything
else Miss Henried They want human flesh
Im prepared to take whatever steps are
necessary to see to it they dont get mine
Not while Im still using it

JULIE has calmed herself down Now she feels angry betrayed She
looks at MARY accusingly

JULIE
Did you know About the de-caps

MARY
Id never seen it before

JULIE
But you knew

MARY nods in the affirmative Tears form in JULIES eyes

JULIE
What else is there doctor What else do
you people know that the rest of us dont

They stare at one another Whatever bond once existed between them
has been severed forever

84 INT A CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - NIGHT

There are CARDIOGRAPHS EEG MONITORS AND ALL SORT OF PHYSICAL
CONDITIONING DEVICES On TABLES lie SYMBOLOGY CARDS AND COLOURED
BLOCKS for dexterity testing There are LARGE CUT-OUT SHAPES on the
walls TRIANGLES SQUARES and familiar ORANGE CIRCLES

MARY storms into the room flinging the door shut behind her RHODES
catches it with his BLACK LEATHER GESTAPO BOOT

RHODES

You cant run away from the planet Miss
Science You cant even run away from the
island heh heh

MARY
Leave me alone youCOCKSUCKER

RHODES laughs loudly MARY faces him hatred boiling away her
vocabulary She cant think of word that are adequate

MARY
Youreyoure disgusting
YoureFILTH

RHODES
And youre the one who builds the bomb and
they says I hope itll never actually be
used

MARY is stoppedby her own guilt She turns and busies herself
gathering books and papers then she CLICKS OFF A LIGHT and moves
toward the doorway where RHODES stands

MARY

(calmer with method) Julie Grant is a
behaviouralist Shes not medical She
hasnt been asexposed toto

thingsas some of the rest of us Shell
be alright Ill talk to her Shell be
alright

RHODES

Oh I have no doubt

MARY

(recognising threat in his voice) If you
put her on the shit list because of her
reaction here tonight Ill go to Dickerson

RHODES

Ah yes our noble Gasparilla does seem to
favour you lately I understand he assigned
you a roommate of your choice The rest of
us have to pick names out of a hat

MARY
(reading his jealousy) Rhodes you and I
had a roll in the hay together when I first
got here It was a wholly unsatisfying
experience which I do not want to and
which I never will repeat So give up
mister Im going hometo that roommate
you mentioned

MARY pushes past RHODES into the hallway

85 INT THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE CONDITIONING ROOM - NIGHT

MARY starts down the hall but RHODES grabs her from behind He leans
in close lusting pressing his lips against the back of her neck

MARY
Take your hands off me Right now
An evil grin returns to RHODES flushed face He stares at the woman
for a long moment then he lets go MARY walks away bristling
RHODES calls after her

RHODES
Maybe youll change your mind when it
starts getting too lonely for you

MARY stops dead She turns back to see him gloating

RHODES

Im not entirely without influence myself
Miss Science I had your roommate
assignedby Gasparilla to my platoon
Whats his name Tyler Yes Toby Tyler

A bubble of fear pushes up in MARYS throat but she is only letting
her anger show Her stare is fierce her eyes daggers

RHODES

I had an unfortunate little run-in with him
today In factyou might say that Mr
Tyler is in big trouble with
theauthorities

MARY

You better not mess with me Rhodes Id
love to serve your balls to those Red Coats
for lunch Think about it

RHODES
No Miss Science Youre the one who needs
to do some thinking

He turns and walks away MARY stands still for a time THE SOUND OF
RHODES CLICKING BOOTHEELS surrounding her swallowing her In the
DEEP BACKGROUND we can HEAR THE MOANS OF THE CAGED DEAD

86 INT THE CENTRAL CHAMBERS OF THE CAVE - NIGHT

MONTAGE as MARY walks through HUGE OPEN AREAS CARVED OUT OF NATURAL
ROCK We are stunned at the enormity of the place JEEPS AND TRUCKS
RUMBLE back and forth Storage areas hold MOUNTAINS OF CRATES
CARTONS WATER AND GAS CANISTERS FORK LIFTS shift loads from here to
there

MARY comes to a place where the natural rock surrenders to man-made
walls She enters past TWO SECURITY GUARDS showing her ID

87 INT THE RESIDENCE - NIGHT
MARY moves down A CORRIDOR with NUMBERED DOORS on both sides We HEAR
THE SOUND OF LIFE MUSIC BLASTING VOICES LAUGHING ARGUING CRYING
PEOPLE move by A MAN AND A WOMAN are fighting She slaps him he
punches her she kicks him in the balls THREE HOOKERS pound on a
door The door is opened by A NAKED MAN WEARING A DILDO on his nose
OTHER MEN behind him laugh wildly as the hookers enter their smoke-
filled room

MARY stops in her tracks when she sees that outside A DOOR NUMBERED
83 (the door to her quarters) there are TWO OF RHODES SOLDIERS with
RIFLES in hand The door itself is open and SHADOWS move inside

MARY turns quickly before she is spotted and starts back through
the hallway As she turns a corner she is grabbed by TOBY TYLER

MARY
Tobythank Godwait here I gotta find

TOBY
Hey Slow down What is it

MARY
Some of Rhodes men At the door

TOBY

MARY looks into TOBYS eyes

Shes hurt yet angry The kind of anger

that comes involuntarily when somebody strikes an already sensitive

guilt-nerve

TOBY

She gives up She looks into TOBYS eyes

TOBY

THE SOLDIERS escort TOBY down the hall without force MARY watches
their backs for a time then she flings her BOOKS AND PAPERS angrily
into the open apartment She begins to cry

88 EXT ENTRANCE NUMBER SIX - NIGHT

HATCHWAY NUMBER SIX is surrounded by PROTECTIVE FENCING and from it
A FENCED ALLEYWAY runs off through the brush towardwe dont know
what yet

THE HATCH OPENS and TOBY along with TWO OTHER PRISONERS also
disarmed troopers is led down that alleyway by THREE GUARDS

JOHN SARAH AND BILL McDERMOTT peer out from nearby foliage They
watch the procession John whispers

JOHN

The fences make a safe pathway to Stalag
Seventeen Thats where we live Thats
where you gonna live too Hells half
acre Its not a nice place Them boys
there is prisoners Whats their
punishment They sent out to the Stalag for
a few weeks Thats punishment enough

SPIDER seems to appear from nowhere She motions and the others
follow her through the thick jungle

89 EXT ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

THE RUNNING FENCE LEADS TO A GATE IN A BIGGER FENCE This one is
ELECTRIFIED We know this because we see A COLLECTION OF ZOMBIES
mostly civilians with no vests clambering there HANDS AND FACES
SPARKING WHEN THEY TOUCH THE CHAIN LINKS

THE ZOMBIES send up wild MOANS AND GURGLES when TOBY AND THE OTHER
PRISONERS are led through the gate

Inside the compound is A SCATTERING OF OPEN-SIDED MILITARY TENT-
BUILDINGS resembling those on MASH Theres A DIN coming off the
place a mixture of MUSIC AND VOICES that forms a disturbed blanket
of noise The place seems to seethe like a hornets next

THE SOLDIERS head back for The Cave as POSTED GUARDS shut the gate
behind THE PRISONERS TOBY and the other captives move toward the
village

90 EXT STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET - NIGHT

PEOPLE wallow in the mud ONE MAN has just taken a shit and is wiping
his ass Nearby A DRUNK lies unconscious SEVERAL MEN are fighting
Its a brutal fight with BOTTLES AND PIPES AND LENGTHS OF CHAIN The
men are really hurting each other PEOPLE SMOKE AND SNORT AND SHOOT
UP in wide open disarray

A HUGE PREGNANT WOMAN plants herself right in TOBYS path

PREGNANT WOMAN
How bout it baby Im big but Im
beautiful

TOBY pushes past her and bumps into A SURLY DRUNK

DRUNK
HEY YOU FUCK YOU FUCK

He grabs TOBY and flings him violently against an upright on one of
the long huts THE OTHER TWO PRISONERS move on abandoning TOBY
disappearing into the crowd THE DRUNK pulls A RUSTED HOME-MADE
KNIFE

DRUNK
I OUGHTA SLICE YOU UP YOU FUCK YOU CANT
PUSH ME AROUND LIKE PUSH ME
AROUNDLIKE

Suddenly VOMIT rises in the mans throat and he doubles over TOBY is
aware of SOUNDS behind him At his back in the hut A HAIRY FAT MAN
still wearing his boxer shorts and his muddy boots is wham-bam-
bamming A WHORE who is wearing everything but underwear and boots
There are needle tracks on the womans arms and her face looks as
though shes been beaten brutally She purses her deep red damaged
lips and blows TOBY a kiss thats meant to be seductive

TOBY moves on down the street The place is a cesspool full of human
dregs stinking with refuse filled with the fury and desperation of
man in his last days

91 EXT ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

JOHN leads his followers to within sight of the Stalag gates ZOMBIES
still claw at the ELECTRIFIED FENCE BLUE-WHITE SPARKS fill the air
like flashbulbs

JOHN

little food do a little light

own filth with bugs and snakes and disease
and jungle feverall the time waitin to

JOHN is doing a sales job on SARAH but everything he says is truth
She hears it all softening to JOHNS cause

SPIDER has silently lifted A LARGE WOODEN ROUND out of the weeds
Its a camouflaged tunnel entrance

JOHN
Its a tunnel Its a couple hundred yards
Just keep goin til you reach the end

Ill be right behind you

SARAH starts down into the hole JOHN and the others prepare to
follow JUNGLE SOUNDS cover the noises they make

92 INT THE HOSPITAL IN STALAG SEVENTEEN - NIGHT

We see ROWS OF HOME-MADE COTS each with A BODY lying on top What
faces we see are gaunt showing the boils and lesions of consumptive
diseases and tropical fever INSECTS BUZZ and there is THUNDER in the
air
An Oriental orderly LUKEY moves through the maze of bodies He
lifts the wrist of A WOMAN WHO LOOKS DEAD and he discovers that she
is dead indeed He hurries off

93 INT HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

This is a room with walls an operating room with JURY-RIGGED
APPOINTMENTS On A TABLE under A HALF-DOZEN LIGHT BULBS lies A
CORPSE Another orderly a Nordic type names DIESEL an enormous man
assists while DOCTOR LOGAN methodically SAWS OFF THE CORPSES HEAD

LUKEY rushes in out of breath

LUKEY

Doc Logan Doc Logan Deres a lady dead

how long she been dat way Maybe she
gettin ready to come back

THE CORPSES HEAD ROLLS AWAY FROM ITS BODY DOC LOGAN picks up AN
ELECTRIC DRILL WITH A LONG BIT WHZZZ2ZZ2Z22Z2Z HE DRIVES THE SPINNING
BIT INTO THE DISEMBODIED HEAD DEEP INTO ITS BRAIN When he pulls it
out MATTER FLIES as the motor winds down

LOGAN is a middle aged man He looks exhausted demoralised a bit
mad And he looks as ill as some of his patients There are OPEN
SORES on his face and he hasnt shaved for days Hes covered with
two week worth of BLOOD STAINS He starts around the table leaving
DIESEL to dispose of the DE-CAP

LOGAN

Bury the head Call the guard for the rest
Get it off the table for now Well bring
this new one in

DIESEL doesnt respond right away Hes heard something

LOGAN
What is it

DIESEL
The tunnel

LOGAN hears it now A SCRATCHING SCUFFLING SOUND He looks at his
watch

LOGAN
God Its almost sun-up

LOGAN AND LUKEY move to a spot at the back of the room They remove
SEVERAL OF THE PLANKS in the floor SARAHS head pops out gasping
for air Logan recoils his eyes wide and frightened
LOGAN
Who are you Who are you

He stands up too quickly Dizziness makes him reel He smashes into
AN INSTRUMENT CART comes up with A LONG-BLADED SCALPEL and holds the
thing threateningly aimed at the stranger

JOHN
Its OK Its OK Doc Shes with us

In the next moment SARAH and the others climb out of the tunnel

JOHN

This heres the hospital Thats Diesel
over there the big guy This heres Lukey
and thats Doc Logan whos about to cut
your tonsils out

SPIDER the last one to climb into the room quickly begins
collecting WEAPONS what few the rebels have

JOHN

This heres all the weapons we got Thats
why your fancy automatic looks so good to
us We gotta stick it over here with the
others for now They catch us with any kind
o weapon and its death without even askin
your name

SARAH lets SPIDER take her GUN The deaf mute signs something which
SARAH cant decipher

JOHN
Ammunition You got ammunition in your pack
there I hope you do or the gun aint worth
much

SARAH roots through her SUPPLY PACK and produces THREE LOADED CLIPS
AND SEVERAL BOXES OF LOOSE SHELLS JOHN notices SOME TINS OF FOOD
MEDICINES A KNIFE A COMPASS

JOHN

We better just hide the whole pack
darlin That stuff is just shoutin out
that it come from the mainland The shit we
get is all CD rations Aspirins and
crackers from 1958

SPIDER snatches THE PACK away rather roughly SARAH is a little
disturbed by the action THE MATERIAL is stashed under FLOOR BOARDS
beside the tunnel entrance
JOHN

Lets go You look like you could use some
shut eye Me too We can all get acquainted
tomorrow

LUKEY escorts JOHN AND SARAH out of the operating room into the main
hospital area BILL McDERMOTT pulls out his empty flask

McDERMOTT
Doc I need a fill up Ill help mself if
its alright with you

LOGAN nods distractedly and BILL moves to A SUPPLY CABINET which
contains among other essentials SEVERAL BOTTLES OF BRANDY He fills
his flask eagerly

LOGAN
How do we know shes alright How do we
know

McDERMOTT

Shes alright Christ Rhodes and his
cossacks wiped out her whole party Dan
near got her

McDERMOTT pockets the refilled flask takes a long slug from the
cabinet bottle before putting it back and moves out of the room
LOGAN is left alone with DIESEL AND SPIDER

LOGAN
How do we know shes alright How do we
know

LOGAN repeats his question intoned identically as it was before
Hes twitching slightly and sweat is pouring down his face THE
THUNDER suddenly seems LOUDER

DIESEL
Are you alright Doc You look you look
real bad

LOGAN

I have looked bad for four years Everyone
in the world has looked bad for four years
Thank God looks dont matter as much as
they once did

LOGAN a wild gleam in his eye moves out of the room following
where the others went that LONG-BLADED SCALPEL still clutched in his
hand The others follow
94 INT THE HOSPITAL - NIGHT

JOHN SARAH AND LUKEY are facing out across the compound A TEEMING
TROPICAL RAIN has started to fall

JOHN
This just aint your day is it darlin
Sarah

SARAH cant help but snicker Suddenly her head spins exhaustion is
conquering her body as last JOHN puts a big arm around her

JOHN
Three more minutes Then you can sleep You
gotta stay with it for three more minutes

McDERMOTT joins them and the group moves out into the rain LUKEY
waddles back through the maze of cots

LOGAN SPIDER AND DIESEL have moved to about the center of the big
room The patients around them their eyes bulging look like lemurs

LOGAN

How do we know shes alright How do we
now

The same intonation again This guys wrapping is definitely coming
loose

THE ZOMBIE rises up behind LOGANS back Its the woman whose wrist
Lukey checked earlier Its teeth are dripping with drool its hands
reaching out wantingly

LOGAN turns around Calmly but with the swiftness of a rattlesnake
he shoots out the hand thats holding THE SCALPEL THE BLADE SINKS
DEEPLY INTO THE ZOMBIES FOREHEAD LOGAN pulls it out and strikes
again and again and again like a swordsman thrusting thrusting
thrusting Finally the creature collapses LOGAN wipes the scalpel on
his already blood-covered apron RAIN WATER drops onto him from holes
in the roof above He doesnt seem to notice

95 EXT STALAG SEVENTEEN MAIN STREET (RAIN) - NIGHT

THE STREET SCENE is toned down due to the late hour and the rain but
just as vile just as vicious JOHN AND McDERMOTT escort SARAH JOHN
speaks softly and only when others on the street are far enough
away

JOHN

They supply us with disinfectant and dope
Sex drugs and rock-and-roll What more
could anyone ask for Most around here
aint interested in changin their lives
The folks you metme and them and a
couple others is the whole rebel army
Nobody else gives a shitand theyre
afraid o Rhodes

They pass A STRUCTURE WITH AN OVERHEAD SIGN that reads JOES CORNER
TAVERN If there were walls theyd be pushed out by the MASS OF
HUMANITY inside MUSIC BLARES and VOICES form a wall of noise louder
than the THUNDER A FIGHT spills out onto the muddy street PUSHERS
selling all sort of delights accost JOHN and his group

SARAH
They seem to be havin a good time Some
punishment

JOHN

You disappear in here darlin You get a
knife in yer belly or too much shit in yer
veins You get lost out here and nobodys

all makes for food in the freezers

They come to A LONG HUT WITH A SIGN that reads THE RITZ

JOHN
This is your hotel Im not gonna stay here

SARAH nods JOHN smiles at her His warm trustworthy eyes seem to
glow in the dar

JOHN

Some may notice that youre new Just deny
it Youll get away with it Nobody really
looks at each other around here Go on in
Get some sleep

He squeezes her hand tightly then he turns away and moves off with
McDERMOTT SARAH moves into THE RITZ

96 INT THE RITZ (RAIN) - NIGHT

It resembles the hospital There are ROWS AND ROWS OF COTS SOME
PEOPLE SLEEP alone and in pairs OTHERS are awake drinking
screwing shooting up SARAH finds an empty cot and flops down
Beyond the open walls she can see THE BLUE-WHITE FLASHES coming from
the electrified fence RAIN LEAKS in on her but it doesnt keep her
from falling asleep
97 INT THE CONDITIONING ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

TECHNICIANS are working with ZOMBIES while ARMED GUARDS stand ready
We FOCUS ON A BLUE COAT Under supervision the thing is fumbling to
tie a shoelace Its failing miserably but trying hard ANOTHER BLUE
is busy placing LITTLE WOODEN SHAPES into their proper HOLES IN A
BOARD

TWO RED COATS sit at a table attended by HUMAN TECHNICIANS Weve
seen these zombies before in the dormitory TONTO isor wasa
native American probably Seminole In front of him is A PLATE
containing SEVERAL BITS OF MEAT He has A FORK in his hand and he is
idly stabbing at the meat

The other RED COAT BLUTO looks just like Bluto from Popeye bulky
with a thick black beard Tired of THE JIG SAW PUZZLE hes working
on he snarls and suddenly lunges for the meat on TONTOS plate He
snatches a handful and stuffs it in his mouth As soon as he tastes
it however he pulls it back out dribbling and spitting
disgustedly

FISHER (a technician)
They wont accept a substitute They want
their Alpo

TONTO has succeeded in forking a piece of meat He moves it to his
mouth and pops it in

FISHER
Alright Way ta go Kemosabe

MARY HENRIED has entered the room She pulls up and watches TONTO
with a kind of dubious interest TONTO stops chewing He looks up
with exaggerated sadness on his face Slowly his mouth opens and the
chewed piece of meat slides out between his lips He throws his fork
down angrily

MARY
They wont learn to use forks if they dont
like the breakfast youre serving Ted

FISHER

The fork is like a game to them If they
get into the game maybe theyll learn to
like the food

MARY
t wont work

Suddenly BLUTO jumps up from the table He flings his chair aside and
tromps right over to MARY His arms are outstretched and he is making
a pleading Karloff-like SOUND GUARDS come after him but MARY waves
them off

MARY
Its alright Leave him alone

MARY extends her right hand to meet BLUTOS right and they shake
vigorously Then the dumb creature drops his arms and looks around
His brain sends no signal as to what he should do next THE GUARDS
lead him away

98 INT THE FIRING RANGE IN THE CAVE - MORNING
BLAM A RED COAT is FIRING A PISTOL right AT THE LENS

CLOSE ON A TARGET a flat cut out silhouette of a man BLACK
TRIANGLES painted on the instant-kill-zones brain heart BULLETS
STRIKE the neck the to torso SOME RICOCHET off the wall behind
None hit the kill-zones

MARY HENRIED enters The place resembles a Police Department target
range RED COATS stand in stalls and FIRE down LONG ALLEYS at TARGETS
which pop up against the opposite wall THE NOISE is deafening TWO
TECHNICIANS are watching the shooters and keeping score MARY walks
up to one of them

MARY
Have you seen Julie Grant this morning

TECHNICIAN
She should be in the behaviour rooms

MARY
Shes not Hasnt shown up yet

Theres AN OFF-SCREEN GROAN the sound of a zombie trying to
communicate MARY turns and sees the tall RED COAT names BUB standing
in the closest stall trying to attract MARYS attention (He was the
one Rhodes referred to last night as Marys pride and joy) He is
wearing WESTERN-STYLE GUN BELTS SIX-SHOOTER hang in HOLSTERS on both
his hips MARY faces BUB full with her body and delivers a military
salute

MARY
Good morning Bub

BUB replies with one of those pathetic sounds that obviously mean
something to him Then he too salutes MARY pulls away heading for
AN EXIT but BUB calls after her He makes inarticulate sounds but we
catch his drift

TECHNICIAN
I think he wants you to watch
MARY
OK Bub Do your stuff

BUB turns towards the target wall looking like a gunfighter ona
western street Theres A HUMMING MECHANICAL SOUND KATCHUNG A
SILHOUETTE pops up BUB slaps leatherfast lighting fast BOTH
GUN come up BLAM-KA-BLAM-KA-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM

HOLES APPEARS IN THE TARGETWOP-WOPPETY-WHUMP All in the kill-
zones or damn close

BUB slaps ONE PISTOL back into its HOLSTER He clicks open the shell-
chamber on THE OTHER dumps the SPENT CARTRIDGES and begins to reload
from his belt

MARY stares at the creatures back mixed emotions showing on her
face BUB turns to face her Dropping a bullet he salutes again
MARY hesitates then salutes back

MARY
Very good Bub Thatsvery good
99 INT A LOCKER ROOM IN THE CAVE - MORNING

PEOPLE are changing clothes going on and off duty JULIE GRANT

JULIE slams the locker door and storms away toward the exit

MARY

There are TWO WOMEN cleaning the locker room with MOPS AND PAILS One
of them turns to watch MARY HENRIED exit We recognise her Its
SPIDER

100 INT THE COUNCIL CHAMBER IN THE CAVE - MORNING

This is a large Situations Room that is serving now as GOVERNMENT
HEADQUARTERS In A BIG STUFFED OFFICE CHAIR behind A DESK FLANKED
WITH FLAGS sits GOVERNOR HENRY DICKERSON (former of Florida now of
the world) AKA GASPARILLA

At TABLES sit A DOZEN OR SO COUNCILMEN Dickersons cronies from the
old Doral Country Club close friends who were offered asylum in the
private underground shelter Now they sit in council yessing
everything the boss man says

A STATE PROSECUTOR has a DESPERATE-LOOKING PRISONER on the floor
standing with his hands cuffed

PROSECUTOR

He was found with a government-issue short-
wave transmitter in his quarters Hes
charged with the theft of that equipment
from a government installation and with
possession of an illegal radio

GASPARILLA munches on SOME FRUIT Hes a fat man with a handlebar
moustache that makes him look like Pancho Villa As an indication of
rank we wears a military jacket but underneath is a Hawaiian shirt
with a bold flamingo and palm tree pattern Around his neck nestled
in the rolls of fat there is enough gold to stake a small business

PROSECUTOR

I can only suggest that the court rule in
favour of the ultimate penalty for this
traitor

GAS PARILLA
You always recommend the ultimate penalty
Tommy Lee You and Rhodes

We now see that RHODES is present looking on with a smile
GAS PARILLA
All thoseAGAINSTthe ultimate penalty

None of THE COUNCILMEN move a muscle GASPARILLA scans them slowly as
he takes a big wet bite out of a peach

GASPARILLA
Ya mean ta say nobodys gonna object to the
ultimate penalty in this here case Well
what if I object What if I object to the
ultimate penalty

THE COUNCILMEN look nervous apprehensive GASPARILLAS flexing his
power-muscles

GAS PARILLA

fer what I think any more Well Im a-
gonna let this guy off How dyall like

THE PRISONER looks up at GASPARILLA hatred boiling inside him
GASPARILLA meets his gaze with a power-mad sneer

GAS PARILLA
Yer sentenced ta hard labour Stalag
Seventeen A year

PRISONER
WHY DONT YOU KILL ME I PREFER TO DIE I

GASPARILLA

back in his chair flustered but unscarred His skin is about a foot
thick He pitches the peach and grabs up a mango MARY HENRIED enters
the chamber and rushes toward an empty chair GASPARILLA checks THE
DOCKET on his desk smiles and looks up at MARY

GAS PARILLA

RHODES replaces THE PROSECUTOR on the floor He smiles at MARY
pointedly as he starts his speech

RHODES

Private Tyler I dont want to

MARY

(standing) Sir Tyler is innocent of any
crime against the State Captain Rhodes

GAS PARILLA
(with a mouthful of mango) Miss Henried I

MARY
Captain Rhodes is trying to

GAS PARILLA
(spitting a wad of chewed pulp into his
hand) MISS HENRIED SHUT THE HELL UP

MARYS eyes indicate her frustration and anger but she does shut up
GASPARILLA plops the handful of fruit pulp onto the floor wiping his
fingers on his military jacket

RHODES

I dont want to take up a lot of time with
this Mr Tyler shot a prisoner against
orders There are eyewitnesses Ive
reprimanded Tyler and Ive had him sent
outside Its as simple as that

GAS PARILLA
Ya had im sent ta the Stalag Thats all

RHODES

The prisoner was dying sir Tyler acted
out of a sense of mercy I dont believe
Tyler to be dangerous General He just

MARY checks herself Theres a perverse air of danger fuming off the
fat General His attitude toward MARY has clearly changed RHODES has
been working on him MARY seems to have lost this round She can only
hope thats all shes going to lose

GAS PARILLA

Now I think Captains punishment is fair
considerin In fact I think you aint got

MARY

(softly carefully) Im sorry General if

MARY shoots a hate-filled eye full at RHODES THE CAPTAIN responds
with a phoney look of sympathy

101 INT GASPARILLAS GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The place is full of EXERCISE EQUIPMENT TREADMILLS WEIGHTS A
NAUTILUS ETC There are other items which seem contradictory PLUSH
PILLOWS A HUGE CIRCULAR BED SURROUNDED BY MIRRORS Delicacies of
FOOD AND DRINK lie about on LOW TABLES The room is a cross between
Elaine Powers and a harem chamber

A HUGE COFFIN-SHAPED DEVICE opens and we see that the inside is lined
with ULTRAVIOLET TUBES which are covered with plexiglass GASPARILLA
lounges inside the thing sweating having just taken a long dose of
fake sunshine

All around are THE COUNCILMEN some with COUNTRY-CLUB TYPE WOMEN
conservatively dressed and wearing suitable jewellery (obviously
wives left over from the good old days) and some with SCANTILY CLAD
COURTESANS

OTHER SCANTILY CLAD BUNNY TYPES are serving HORS-DOEUVRES and
pouring WINE offering SMOKE AND SNORT

MARY HENRIED is sitting on the floor lost in fluffy pillows her LAB
COAT incongruous RHODES watches her from nearby

GASPARILLA
AWRITE CMON LADIES OFF WITH IT AND ON
WITH ITHA HA HA

MUSIC BLARES and SEVERAL OF THE COURTESANS spring up stripping off
what few clothes they are wearing Some strip naked others down to
panties They hop onto various exercise machines and begin to
workout tits flopping thighs pumpingGASPARILLAS kind of
entertainment

GAS PARILLA

Oh Lordy LordyIm drunk as a skunk
Look at thiswill ya jus loooooook at
these lovelies Say Henried you ever try
it with another woman

MARY looks up at the General not knowing whether or not she should
answer afraid of what he might try to make her do

GASPARILLA
Ive tried it with boys Too strenuous

FOUR MORE WOMEN have brought in SILVER PLATTERS full of NEW HORS-
DOEUVRES prepared carefully and laid them out like sushi Theyre
distributed and people eat them

GAS PARILLA
FolksI just couldnt resist How dyall
like those How do those taste

GUESTS look up not knowing what to expect MARY fears the worst She
looks around to see RHODES grinning A knot comes up into her throat
She tries to swallow it down

GAS PARILLA
Fresh from the freezers folks Its
whatTHEYEAT

A FEW OF THE GUESTS are revulsed ONE MAN starts to vomit and he runs
from the room

GAS PARILLA

Just kiddin folks Just kiddin Would I
do a thing like that I ask ya now would
I Hah ha ha ha ha

Relief spreads and the bacchanalian atmosphere restores itself
GASPARILLA spills himself out of the tanning coffin and flops down on
some pillows near MARY He grabs up a goblet and swills red wine
which runs down his front

GAS PARILLA

The great state of Florida People came
here fer years ta die Retire and expire
The rest o the country used ta think we

fogies Hah Now this heres the new
Capital o the World Hah They came

GASPARILLA swallows another huge quantity of wine
DISSOLVE TO
102 INT THE GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

The room is empty now Remnants of food and drink clutter the place
THE FAT GENERAL is asleep snoring loudly one of his pudgy arms is
draped across MARY HENRIEDS lap She is trying to move out from
under without waking the man She slides on the floora few
inchesa few inches more GASPARILLA snorts and rolls over His
eyes pop open focus on MARY and a smile pushes his fat cheeks back

GAS PARILLA
Well hi there yall

Mary looks down at the man repulsed and afraid Suddenly he grabs
her LAB COAT She pulls away and he crawls after her his belly
bouncing along the floor BUTTONS POP and the coat falls open He
reaches for her blouse It tears away and for a moment he gets a
chubby handful of bare breast He dives into her but hes unconscious
before his face reaches her chest

MARY pulls herself out from under his dead weight Shivering she
clutches her blouse together and hurries out of the room

103 EXT ENTRANCE TO STALAG SEVENTEEN - DAWN

TWO COT PEOPLE who happen to be at close range They tumble to the
dirt floor dead before they hit

RHODES scans the rest of the hut He spots a familiar face THE
PRISONER from the Council Room the one Gasparilla saved from a death
sentence The man makes the sign of the cross knowing whats coming
BLAM BLAM RHODES FIRES TWO RAPID ROUNDS and THE PRISONERS CHEST
TURNS RED He flies off his cot into one adjacent landing on top of
a SCREAMING WOMAN

RHODES AND HIS MEN leave as abruptly as they entered SARAH is
stunned As PEOPLE around her react with sobs and more screams she
locks her eyes on RHODES

He is moving authoritatively down the street just outside the open-
walled structure He passes within inches of SARAHS cot which is
right against the outside rail Her emotions well up inside her She
is about to jump out into the street when A BIG BLACK HAND grabs her
arm Its JOHN who has pushed through the gathering crowd outside

SARAH

DOC LOGAN works with them doing the same delicate procedure
Suddenly his hands starts to tremble

LOGAN

SPIDER reaches over and as gently as possible takes the VIAL and
THE DYNAMITE out of the doctors hands She sets the tube in the rack
and returns the dynamite to AN OPEN CRATE years old and crusted with
mildew and mud still half-filled with sticks yet to be drained The
danger passed they all breathe a sigh of relief LOGAN wipes the
river of sweat from his face His hands are shaking quite violently

Silence falls over the room Finally JOHN moves towards the door
TOBY follows but before exiting he turns back to face the group once
more

TOBY

I wanna see Rhodes burn just a much as you

the right to be their judges just like
they dont have the right to be our judges

JOHN opens the door and TOBY exits SARAH follows JOHN looks around
at the faces in the group then he leaves shutting the door behind
him Theres a long silence then LOGAN speaks

LOGAN

We know what we must do Its written for
us in the Bible They shall be driven from
the land of the living down to the world of
the dead That is the fate of those who
care nothing for God

They enter the clearing with the spectacular PLANTS that Miguel
discovered Six feet tall their red-gold blossoms like trumpets with
their bells down these are Daturas nightshades indigenous to
southern Florida and parts of the Caribbean

SALLY AND JACK who we saw working on the nitro sticks are chopping
off the eighteen-inch blossom and stuffing them into LARGE LEAF BAGS
Theyre wearing HOSPITAL MASKS over their mouth and noses JOHN moves

Playboy slowly gets up and starts towards A CONTROL PANEL At the
last minute he spins around grabbing JULIES GUN BARREL and pushing
it away JULIES YOUNG ACCOMPLICE swings his RIFLE BUTT and knocks
Playboy cold Then he trains the weapon on Spam man again

JULIE moves to the controls examines them trips A TOGGLE marked
LOCK and pushes A LARGE GREEN BUTTON

THE DOOR TO THE OUTSIDE SWINGS OPEN Beyond is blackness with an
occasional patch of MOONLIGHT ON JUNGLE GROWTH JULIE walks slowly
carefully toward the opening Just as she is about to cross the
threshold into the night A HUGE FIGURE leaps at her grabbing her
RIFLE and enclosing her in a strangle hold Its DIESEL Behind him
comes JACK his RIFLE (Sarahs rifle) levelled off at JULIES YOUNG
FRIEND

Spam man makes a break for it down the hall Reacting nervously
too quickly JACK FIRES SPAM MAN IS HIT SQUARELY IN THE BACK He

YOUNG MAN
Hey What the hell

JACK FIRES ANOTHER BURST and the ORANGE CIRCLE ON THE YOUNG MANS

expression on his face and he flops dead right on top of the
Playboy guard who is lying near the control booth

LOGAN
ENOUGH ENOUGH ENOUGH ENOUGH

THE DOC comes slowly out of the night guiding SPIDER over the
threshold and into the hall LOGAN reminds us of a crazy John
Houston floating on air in a madmans bubble

JULIE
Whatwhat is this Who

LOGAN

simply helped us do the Lords work

LOGANS SHOULDER WOUND IS BLEEDING THROUGH ITS DRESSINGS but the
doctor on a holy mission seems to feel no pain He guides SPIDER
into the light and opens her shirt DIESEL shoves JULIE against a
wall JACK covers her with his AUTOMATIC

LOGAN removes RED-SOAKED DRESSING from SPIDERS skin All over her
bare chest and upper belly we see LONG EIGHT-INCH SCARS HASTILY
STITCHED WITH SUTURE SHOWING Beneath each is A CIGAR-SHAPED BULGE
where a vial of nitro has been implanted The woman stands on
crumbling legs her arms open outward a grotesque lampoon of a

push the door open but then he falls in a heap

A RADIO MAN staggers into A WEBBING OF WIRES then he too falls

THE OTHER SECURITY GUARD inches his hand towards A LEVER WITH A
