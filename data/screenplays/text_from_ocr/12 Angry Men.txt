and that concludes the courts
explanation of the legal aspects of
this case And now gentlemen of the
jury I come to my final instruction
to you Murder in the first degree -

- premeditated homicide -- is the

most serious charge tried in our
criminal courts Youve listened to
the testimony and youve had the law
read to you and interpreted as it
applies to this case It now becomes
your duty to try and separate the
facts from the fancy One man is
dead The life of another is at
stake I urge you to deliberate
honestly and thoughtfully If there

is a reasonable doubt -- then you
must bring me a verdict of not
guilty If however there is no

reasonable doubt then you must in
good conscience find the accused
guilty However you decide your
verdict must be unanimous In the
event you find the accused guilty

ACCUSED
Rican man vulnerable and afraid

JUDGE (CONT)
the bench will not entertain a
recommendation for mercy The death
sentence is mandatory in this case

faced with a grave responsibility

can be seen the New York skyline Off the jury room is a washroom
with a lavatory beyond A large scarred table is C with twelve
chairs around it A bench stands against the wall and there are
several extra chairs and a small table in the room plus a water-—
cooler with paper cups and a waste basket and an electric fan over
the bench and a clock over the cooler and row of hooks for coats
with a shelf over it There are pencils pads and ashtrays on the
table At night the room is lit by fluorescent lighting with the ©
switch next to the door

The Jurors enter preceded by a Guard He checks his list The 9th
Juror an old man crosses goes into the washroom and exits to
the lavatory The 4th Juror begins to read a newspaper Several
jurors open the windows Others move awkwardly about the room
There ig no conversation for a few moments The 3rd Juror takes

of the killing he heard loud noises

in the apartment upstairs He said

it sounded like a fight Then he

heard the kid shout out Im gonna

kill you A second later he heard
a body fall and he ran to the door of

‘his apartment looked out and saw the

kid runningdown the stairs and out

of the house Then he called the

police They found the father with a
knife in his chest

6TH JUROR ©
I dont know I started to be
convinced uh -- you know very early

in the case Well I was looking for
the motive Thats very important
If theres no motive wheres the
case So anyway that testimony
from those people across the hall
from the kids apartment that was
very powerful Didnt they say
something about an argument between
the father and the boy around seven
oclock that night I mean I can be
wrong

11TH JUROR ©

It was eight oclock Not seven

8TH JUROR

Thats right Eight oclock They
heard an argument but they couldnt
hear what it was about Then they
heard the father hit the boy twice
and finally they saw the boy walk
angrily out of the house What does
that prove

6TH JUROR

Well it doesnt exactly prove

anything Its just part of the
picture I didnt say it proved
anything

8TH JUROR
You said it revealed a motive for the

killing The prosecuting attorney

said the same thing Well I dont
think its a very strong motive

This boy has been hit so many times
in his life that violence is
practically a normal state of affairs
for him I cant see two slaps in
the face provoking him into
committing murder

8TH JUROR (CONT)

‘up Everybody sounded so positive

that I started to get a peculiar
feeling about this trial I mean
nothing is that positive I had
questions I would have liked to ask
Maybe they wouldnt have meant
anything I dont know But I
started to feel that the defense
counsel wasnt doing his job He let
too many things go Little things

10TH JUROR ae
What little things Listen when
these guys dont ask questions
thats because they know the answers
already and they figure theyll be
hurt

8TH JUROR

Maybe Its also possible for a

lawyer to be just plain stupid isnt
it

6TH JUROR
You sound like youve met my

brother-in-law

A few jurors laugh

8TH JUROR

(smiling)
I kept putting myself in the boys
place I would have asked for’
another lawyer I think I mean if
I was on trial for my life Id want
my lawyer to tear the prosecution
witnesses to shreds or at least to
try Look there was one alleged
eye-witness to this killing Someone
else claims he heard the killing and
then saw the boy running out
afterwards There was a lot of
circumstantial evidence but actually
those two witnesses were the entire
case for the prosecution Supposing
they were wrong ee

12TH JUROR
What do you mean Supposing they
were wrong Whats the point of
having witnesses at all
FIRST DRAFT - 21496

8TH JUROR
Could they be wrong

12TH JUROR
They sat on the stand under oath
What are you trying to say

‘havent talked yet Shouldnt we

3RD JUROR

Look they can talk whenever they

Okay what about the knife You

admitted buying on the night of the
murder Lets talk about that

8TH JUROR
All right lets talk about it
Lets get it in here and look at it
Id like to see it again (He turns
to the Foreman) Mr Foreman
FIRST DRAFT - 21496 99

The Foreman rises and crosses to the door

3RD JUROR
We all know what it looks like

The Foreman knocks on the door The Guard enters The Foreman
whispers to him The Guard nods and exits

3RD JUROR
What are we gonna get out of seeing
it again

5TH JUROR

You brought it up

4TH JUROR
The gentleman has a right to see
exhibits in evidence
(to the 8th Juror)
The knife and the way it was bought
is pretty strong evidence Dont you
think so

8TH JUROR
I do

4TH JUROR
Good Now suppose we take these
facts one at a time One The boy
admitted going out of his house at
eight o’clock on the night of the
murder after being punched several
times by his father

8TH JUROR
He didnt say punched He said
hit Theres a difference between

a slap and a punch

4TH JUROR
After being hit several times by his
father Two The boy went directly
to a neighborhood junk shop where he
bought a What do you call these
things --

3RD JUROR
Switch-knives

3RD JUROR4TH JUROR
--a switchblade knife
FIRST DRAFT - 21496

4TH JUROR

(to the 3rd Juror)
Thank you Three This wasnt what
youd call an ordinary knife It had
‘a very unusual carved handle Four
The storekeeper who sold it to him
identified the knife in court and
said it was the only one of its kind
he had ever had in stock Five At
oh about eight-forty-five the boy
ran into three friends of his in
front of a diner Am I correct so
far

8TH JUROR
Yes you are

3RD JUROR
(to the 8th Juror)
You bet he is
(to the others)

Now listen to this man He knows

what hes talking about

4TH JUROR
The boy talked with his friends for
about an hour leaving them at nine-
forty-five During this time they
saw the switch-knife Six Each of
them identified the death weapon in
court as that same knife Seven

‘The boy arrived home at about ten

oclock Now this is where the
stories offered by the boy and the
State begin to diverge slightly He

claims that he stayed home until

eleven-thirty and then went to one of
those all-night movies He returned
home at about three-fifteen in the
morning to find his father dead and
himself arrested Now what happened
to the switch-knife This is the
charming and imaginative little fable
the boy invented He claims that the
knife fell through a hole in his
pocket some time between eleven-
thirty and three-fifteen while he was
on his trip to the movies and that he
never saw it again Now this is a
tale gentlemen I think its quite
clear that the boy never went to the
movies that night

FIRST DRAFT - 21496

The Guard enters carrying a curiously designed knife with a tag’
hanging from it The 4th Juror goes to the Guard takes the knife

from him The

4TH JUROR (CONT)

No one in the house saw-him go out at
eleven-thirty No one at the theater
identified him He cotldnt even
remember the names of the pictures he
saw What actually happened is this
the boy stayed home had another
fight with his father stabbed him to

death with the knife at ten minutes

after twelve and fled from the house
He even remembered to wipe the knife
clean of fingerprints

guard exits

4TH JUROR (CONT)
Everyone connected with the case
identified the knife Now are you
trying to tell me that it really fell
through a hole in the boys pocket
and that someone picked it up off the

‘street went to the boys house and

stabbed his father with it just to be
amusing

8TH JUROR
No Im saying its possible that
the boy lost the knife and that
someone else stabbed his father with
a similar knife Its possible

The 4th Juror flicks open the knife and jams it into the table

4TH JUROR
Take a look at that knife Ive
never seen one like it Neither had
the storekeeper who sold it to the
boy Arent you asking us to accept
a pretty incredible coincidence

8TH JUROR
Im not asking anyone to accept it
Im just saying that its possible

3RD JUROR
(shouting)
And Im saying its not possible
FIRST DRAFT - 21496 ‘ ra

The 8th Juror stands for a moment in silence then he reaches into
his pocket and swiftly withdraws a knife He olds it in front of
his face and flicks open the blade then he leans forward and
sticks the knife into the table alongside the other They are
exactly alike There is a burst of sound in the room The 8th
Juror stands back from the table watching

6TH JUROR
Look at it Its the same knife

7TH JUROR
What is this

12TH JUROR

you think you are

4TH JUROR

Quiet Lets be quiet
(to the 8th Juror)

Were dyou get that knife

8TH JUROR
I was walking for a couple of hours
last night just thinking I walked
through the boys neighborhood The
knife comes from a little pawnshop
three blocks from his house It cost
six dollars

4TH JUROR
Its against the law to buy or sell
switch-blade knives

8TH JUROR
Thats right I broke the law

3RD JUROR
Listen You pulled a real bright
trick here Now supposing you tell
me what you proved Maybe there are
ten knives like that So what
FIRST DRAFT - 21496

8TH JUROR
Maybe there are

3RD JUROR
So what does that mean Its the
same kind of knife So whats that
The discovery of the age or
something

11TH JUROR
It would still be an incredible
coincidence for another person to
have stabbed the father with the same
kind of knife

3RD JUROR
Thats right Hes right

7TH JUROR
The odds are a million to one

8TH JUROR
Its possible

4TH JUROR
But not very probable

FOREMAN
Listen lets take seats Theres no
point in milling around here

They begin to move back to their seats The 8th Juror stands
watching

Its interesting that hed find a
knife exactly like the one the boy
bought

3RD JUROR
Whats interesting You think it
proves anything

2ND JUROR
Well no I was just

3RD JUROR
Interesting
(he points at the 8th Juror)
Listen how come the kid bought the
knife to begin with

8TH JUROR
Well he claims that

“BRD JUROR
I know He claims he bought it asa
present for a friend of his He was
gonna give it to him the next day
because he busted the other kid’s
knife dropping it on the pavement

Thats what he said

7TH JUROR
Baloney

9TH JUROR

The friend testified that the boy did
break his knife

3RD JUROR
Yeah And how long before the
killing Three weeks Right So
how come our noble lad bought this
knife one half hour after his father
smacked him and three and a half
hours before they found it shoved up
to here in the fathers chest

7TH JUROR
Well he was gonna give the knife to
his friend He just wanted to use it
for a minute

There is scattered laughter

8TH JUROR

(to the 3rd Juror)
Let me ask you this Its one of the
questions I wanted to ask in court
If the boy bought the knife to use on
his father how come he showed what
was going to be the murder weapon to
three friends of his just a couple of
hours before the killing

3RD JUROR
Listen all of this is just talk
The boy lied and you know it

8TH JUROR

He may have lied
(to 10th Juror)
Do you think he lied

know my answer He lied

8TH JUROR

He breaks off and looks nervously around

3RD JUROR

Maybe Now wait a second

What are you the kids lawyer or
something Who do you think you are
to start cross-examining us

in a jury room

3RD JUROR
Listen there are still eleven of us
in here who think hes guilty

7TH JUROR

anybodys mind So if you want to be
stubborn and hang this jury go
ahead The kid’s be tried again and
found guilty sure as hes born

supposing But Ill try one
Suppose you talk us all outta this
and the kid really did knife his
father

The 6th Juror looks at the 8th Juror for a moment then goes into
the jury room The 8th Juror stands alone for a few moments and we
know that this is the problem which has been tormenting him He
does not know and never will He switches out the washroom light

goes into the jury room

Im sorry go ahead

6TH JUROR
I didnt mean to interrupt

4TH JUROR
No Go ahead Its all right

7 6TH JUROR
Well I was going to say well this
is probably a small point but
anyway

(to the 8th Juror)

The boy had a motive for the killing
You know the beatings and all So
if he didnt do it who did Who
else had the motive Thats my
point I mean nobody goes out and
kills someone without a motive not
unless hes just plain nuts Right

8TH JUROR
As far as I know were supposed to
decide whether or not the boy on
trial is guilty beyond a reasonable —
doubt Were not concerned with
anyone elses motives here Thats a
job for the police

4TH JUROR

Very true But we cant help letting
the only motive we know of creep into
our thoughts can we And we cant
help asking ourselves who else might
have had a motive Logically these
things follow

(he nods towards the 6th juror)
This gentleman is asking a reasonable
question Somebody killed him If

ait wasnt the boy who was it

3RD JUROR

Okay Its just letting off steam

Im sorry Go ahead

4TH JUROR
(to the 8th Juror)
Well maybe you can answer me Who

‘else might have killed the father

8TH JUROR
Well I dont know The father
wasnt exactly a model citizen The
boys lawyer outlined is background
in hisclosing statement He was in
prison once He was known to be a
compulsive gambler and a pretty
consistent loser He spent a lot of
time in neighborhood bars and hed
get into fist fights sometimes after
a couple of drinks Usually over a
woman He was a tough cruel
primitive kind of man who never held
a job for more than six months in his
life So here are a few —
possibilities He could have been
murdered by one of many men he served
time with in prison By a bookmaker
By a man hed beaten up By a woman
hed picked up By any one of the
rough characters he was known to hang
out with ‘

10TH JUROR
Boy-oh-boy thats the biggest load
of crap I ever Listen we know the

father was a bum So what has that
got to do with anything

“I didnt bring it up I was asked

who else might have killed him TI

9TH JUROR
(pointing at 4th Juror)
That gentleman over there asked a
direct question
FIRST DRAFT - 21496

10TH JUROR
Everyones a lawyer

3RD JUROR

Look suppose you answer this for me
The old man who lived downstairs
heard the kid yell out Im going to
kill you A split second later he
heard a body hit the floor Then he
saw the kid run out of the house

Now what does all that mean to you

8TH JUROR

I was wondering how clearly the old

man could have heard the boys voice
through the ceiling

3RD JUROR
He didnt hear it through the
ceiling His window was open and so
was the window upstairs It was a
hot night remember

8TH JUROR

’ The voice came from another

apartment Its not easy to identify
a voice especially a shouting voice

FOREMAN

He identified it in court He picked —

the boys voice out of five other
voices blindfolded

8TH JUROR
That was just an ambitious district
attorney putting on a show Look
the old man knows the boys voice
very well Theyve lived in the same
house for years But to identify it
positively from the apartment
downstairs Isnt it possible he
was wrong -- that maybe he thought
the boy was upstairs and
automatically decided that the voice
he heard was the boys voice

4TH JUROR
I think thats a bit far-fetched

10TH JUROR

-Brother you can say that again

Se ST

body falling and then he saw the boy
run out of the house fifteen seconds
later He saw the boy

12 JUROR
Check And dont forget the woman
across the street She looked right
into the open window and saw the boy
stab his father I mean isnt that
enough for you

- 8TH JUROR
Not right now No it isnt

7TH JUROR
How do you like him Its like
talking into a dead phone

4TH JUROR
The woman saw the killing through the
windows of a moving elevated train
The train had six cars and she saw it
through the windows of the last two
cars She remembered the most
significant details I dont see how
you can argue with that

3RD JUROR
(to 8th Juror)
Well what have you got to say ‘about
it

8TH JUROR
I dont know It doesnt sound right
to me

3RD JUROR
Well suppose you think about it
(to 12th Juror)
Lend me your pencil

The 12th Juror hands the pencil to 3rd Juror who starts to draw
what is obviously a tic-tac- toe pattern on the pad

long it takes an elevated train

anything

How long Take a guess

4TH JUROR
I wouldnt have the slightest idea

(to 5th Juror)
What do you think

5TH JUROR -
I dont know About ten or twelve
seconds maybe

3RD JUROR
Whats all this for

8TH JUROR
Id say that was a fair guess
Anyone else

11TH JUROR
That sounds right to me

10TH JUROR
Come on whats the guessing game
for

8TH JUROR
(to 2nd Juror)
What would you say

2ND JUROR
Ten seconds Approximately

4TH JUROR
All right Say ten seconds What
are you getting at

8TH JUROR
This It takes a six car el train
ten seconds to pass a given point
Now say that given point is the open
window of the room in which the

FIRST DRAFT 21496

8TH JUROR (CONT)
killing took place You can almost
reach out ‘the window of that room and
touch the el tracks Right

5TH JUROR

Right

8TH JUROR
All right Now let me ask you this -
- has anyone here ever lived right
next to the el tracks

6TH JUROR
Well I just finished painting an
apartment that overlooked an el line

Im a house painter yknow I was

He laughs

ye

there for three days

8TH JUROR
What was it like
6TH JUROR
‘What dya mean
8TH JUROR
Noisy
6TH JUROR

Brother Well it didnt matter -
Were all punch in our business
anyway

8TH JUROR
I lived in a second-floor apartment
next to an el line once When the
windows open and the train goes by
the noise is almost unbearable You
cant hear yourself think

3RD JUROR
Okay You cant hear yourself think
Will you get to the point

8TH JUROR

I will Lets take two pieces of
testimony and try to put them
together First the old man in the
apartment downstairs He says he
heard the boy say Im going to kill
you and a split second later he
FIRST DRAFT - 21496

8TH JUROR (CONT)
heard the body hit the floor One
second later Right

2ND JUROR
Thats right

8TH JUROR
Second the woman in the apartment
across the street She claimed that
she looked out of her window and saw
the killing through the last two cars
of a passing elevated train Right
The last two cars

3RD JUROR
All right What point are you making —
here

8TH JUROR
Now we agreed that an el train takes
about ten seconds to pass a given
point Since the woman saw the

‘stabbing through the last two cars we

can assume that the boy fell to the
floor just as the train passed by
Therefore the el train had been
roaring by the old mans window for a
full ten seconds before the body
fell The old man according to his
own testimony hearing Im going to
kill you and the body falling a
split second later would have had to
hear the boy make this statement
while the el was roaring past his
nose Its not possible that he
could have heard it

3RD JUROR
Thats idiotic Sure he could have
heard it

8TH JUROR
(to 3rd Juror)
Do you think so

3RD JUROR
The old man said the boy yelled it
out Thats enough for me

8TH JUROR
If he heard anything at all he still
couldnt have identified the voice
with the el rearing by

3RD JUROR

Youre talking about a matter of

seconds here Nobody can be that

accurate

8TH JUROR
Well I think that testimony which
could put a human being into the
electric chair should be that
accurate

5TH JUROR
I dont think he could have heard it

6TH JUROR
Yeah Maybe he didnt hear it I
mean with the el noise

3RD JUROR
What are you people talking about

5TH JUROR
Well it stands to reason

3RD JUROR
Youre crazy Why should he lie
Whats he got to gain

9TH JUROR
Attention maybe

You keep coming up with these bright
sayings Why dont you send one in

dollars

that for

Go ahead You can say anything you
want Why do you think the old man
might lie
9TH JUROR -
Its just that I looked at him for a
very long time The seam of his
jacket was split under his arm Did
you notice it I mean to come into
court like that He was a very old
‘man with a torn jacket and he walked
very slowly to the stand He was
dragging his left leg and trying to
hide it because he was ashamed I
think I know him better than anyone
here This is a quiet frightened
insignificant old man who has been
nothing all his life who has never
had recognition his name in the
newspapers Nobody knows him nobody
quotes him nobody seeks his advice
after seventy-five years Thats a
very sad thing to be nothing A man
like this needs to be recognized to
be listened to to be quoted just
once This is very important It
would be so hard for him to recede 2
into the background when theres a
chance to be

7TH JUROR
Now wait a minute Are you trying
to tell us hed lie just so that he
could be important once

9TH JUROR
No He wouldnt really lie But
perhaps hed make himself believe
that hed heard those words and
recognized the boys face

a think like that what do you know

going to kill you but supposing

You didnt prove it at all What are

you talking about

to give us here The phrase was
Im going to kill you and the kid
screamed it out at the top of his
lungs Dont tell me he didnt mean
it Anybody says a thing like that
the way he said it they mean it

2ND JUROR
Well gee I dont know Tf remember
I was arguing with the guy I work
next to at the bank a couple of weeks

yelled at him

kid said he was going to kill him and-
he did kill him

a thing like that so the whole

else has confessed to the crime

wrong

not to you

he The lawyer presented his case
not you How come youve got so much
to say

The lawyér was court-appointed

It could mean he didnt want the

11TH JUROR
Pardon me but I have made some notes
‘here
10TH JUROR -
Notes yet
11TH JUROR -

I would like please to say something
I have been listening very closely
and it seems to mé that this man --
(he indicates the 8th Juror)
has some very good points to make

From what was presented at the trial

the boy looks guilty but maybe if we
go deeper

10TH JUROR
Come on will ya

11TH JUROR
There is a question I would like to
ask We assume that the boy
committed murder He stabbed his
father in the chest and ran away
This was at ten minutes after twelve
Now how was he caught by the police
He came home at three oclock or so
and was captured by two detective in
the hallway of his house My
question is if he really had killed
his father why would he come back
three hours later Wouldnt he be
afraid of being caught
FIRST DRAFT - 21496

3RD JUROR
Look -- he came home to get his
knife Its not nice to leave knives
sticking around in People’ s chests

7TH JUROR
Yeah especially relatives

4TH JUROR
I dont see anything funny about it
(to the 11th Juror)
The boy knew that there were people
who could identify the knife as the
one he had just bought He had to
get it before the police did

11TH JUROR
But if he knew the knife could be -
identified why did he leave it there
in the first place

4TH JUROR
Well I think we can assume he ran
out in a state of panic after he
killed his father and then when he
finally calmed down he realized that
he had left the knife there

11TH JUROR
This then depends on your definition
of panic He was calm enough to see
to it that there were no fingerprints
on the knife Now where did his

panic start and where did it end

3RD JUROR
Look you can forget all that other
stuff He still came home to dig out
his knife and get rid of it

11TH JUROR
Three hours later

3RD JUROR
Sure three hours later

11TH JUROR
If I were the boy and I had killed my
father I would not have come home
three hours later I would be afraid
that the police would be there I
would stay away knife or no knife
— Er

FIRST DRAFT - 21496

3RD JUROR
Listen you voted guilty didnt
you What side are you on

11TH JUROR
I dont believe I have to be loyal to
one side or the other I am simply
asking questions

12TH JUROR
Well this is just off the top of my
head but if I were the boy and Id
you know done the stabbing and
everything Id take a chance and go
back for the knife Ill bet he
figured no one had seen him and that
the body probably wasnt even
discovered yet After all it was
the middle of the night He probably -
thought no’ one would find the boy
till the next day’

11TH JUROR
Pardon Hereis my whole point The
woman across the street testified
that a moment after she saw the
killing that is a moment after the
el train went by she screamed and
then went to telephone the police
Now the boy must certainly have
heard that scream and known that
somebody saw something I dont
think he would have gone back if he
had been the murderer

4TH JUROR
Two points One in his state of
panic he may not have heard the
scream Perhaps it wasnt very loud
Two if he did hear it he may not
have connected it with his own act
Remember he lived in a neighborhood
where screams were fairly
commonplace

3RD JUROR
Right Theres your answer

8TH JUROR
Maybe Maybe he did stab his father
didnt hear the womans scream did
run out in a panic did calm down
three hours later and come back to
try to get the knife risking being
er Ee

FIRST DRAFT - 21496

8TH JUROR (CONT)
caught by the police Maybe all
those things are so But maybe

theyre not I think theres enough

doubt to make us wonder whether he
was there at all during the time the
murder took place

10TH JUROR
What dya mean doubt What are you
talking about didnt the old man
see him running out of the house
Hes twisting the facts Im telling

All right Lets stop arguing for
two minutes in here Cant we stick
to the subject

8TH JUROR
Id like to go over something if you
gentlemen dont mind An important
point for the prosecution was the
fact that the boy after he claimed

“he was at the movies during the hours

the killing took place couldnt name
the pictures he saw or the stars who
appeared in them

(he points to the 4th Juror)
This gentleman has repeated that

point in here several times

4TH JUROR

Thats correct It ‘was the only alibi
the boy offered and he himself
couldnt back it up with any details
at all

8TH JUROR
Putting yourself in the boys place
if you can do you think youd be
able to remember details after an

- upsetting experience such as being

struck in the face by your father

4TH JUROR
I think so if there were any special -
details to remember He couldnt
remember the movies at the theater he
named because he wasnt there that
night

8TH JUROR
According to the police testimony in

court he was questioned by the police

in the kitchen of his apartment while
the body of his father was lying on
the floor in the bedroom Do you
think you could remember details
under such circumstances

4TH JUROR
I do

bring that out He had three months —
from the night of the murder to the

day of the trial in which to memorize

them Ill take the testimony of the
policeman who interrogated him right
after the murder when he couldnt
remember a thing about the movies
great emotional stress or not

the name of some two-bit movie star

I suppose that proves the kid was at
the movies

9TH JUROR
No But it indicates that no one can

prove he wasn’t He might have been
at the movies and forgotten what he
saw It’s possible If it’s
perfectly normal for this gentleman--

what d’ya call it -- capable of
committing murder He described all
those tests inkblots and all that
stuff and he said the kid is
definitely a killer-type Am I
right

12TH JUROR
Check I think he said something

about paranoid tendencies if I’m not
mistaken

FOREMAN
Right Whatever that is he said it
Let’s not forget we’re talking about
a boy who’s always had murder on his
mind

12TH JUROR
His unconscious mind

FOREMAN
Nobody elses

11TH JUROR
I beg pardon in discussing

10TH JUROR
I beg pardon What are you so

goddamn polite about

11TH JUROR
For the same reason you’re not It’s

the way I was brought up

(he turns to the others)
In discussing such a thing as the
murder potential we should remember
that many of us are capable of
committing murder But few of us do
We impose controls upon ourselves to
prevent it The most these
psychiatric tests can accomplish
FIRST DRAFT - 21496 90

11TH JUROR (CONT)
along these lines is this They can

tell us that some day a particular
person may commit a murder Thats
all They prove nothing

4TH JUROR
Then how come they’re admitted in
evidence

11TH JUROR

They have many uses of course In
this case they added to the general
impression the prosecution was trying
to create Perhaps we would find
that if we twelve men took the same
tests one or two of us might be
discovered to have unconscious
desires to kill and the potentiality
‘of carrying them out Yet none of us
has To say that a man is capable of
murder does not mean that he has
committed murder

10TH JUROR
But it can mean it Listen if they

said the kid is capable of killing
he couldve killed couldn’t he

8TH JUROR
Youre the one who said and I quote

“I wouldn’t give you a nickel for a
psychiatrists testimony

10TH JUROR

12TH JUROR
Okay with me

2ND JUROR
Um -- there’s something I’d like to

say I mean it’s been bothering me

a little and as long as were

stuck Well there was this whole
business about the stab wound and how
it was made the downward angle of
it you know

3RD JUROR

“Dont tell me were gonna start with

that They went over it and over it

2ND JUROR
I know they did but I don’t go along

with it The boy is five feet seven

inches tall His father was six-two
Thats a difference of seven inches
It’s a very awkward thing to stab
down into the chest of someone whos
more than a half a foot taller than
you are

or

The 8th Juror slides the knife across the table tothe and Juror
who opens and examines it
FIRST DRAFT - 21496 99

indicating the knife)

The 2nd Juror hands the knife to the 3rd Juror

Look you’re not gonna be satisfied

till you gee it again I’m gonna give

Juror rises and crosses to the 3rd Juror They stand looking at
each other

3RD JUROR (CONT)

Okay

(to the 2nd Juror)
‘Now watch this I dont want to
‘have to do it again

(he turns to the 8th Juror

looks squarely at him and

squats to make himself shorter)
I’m six or seven inches shorter than
you Right

2ND JUROR
That’s right Maybe a little more

3RD JUROR
Okay Let it be more

He flicks open the knife changes its position in his hand and
holds it aloft ready to stab downwards

The 8th Juror and the 3rd Juror look steadily at each other then
the 3rd Juror suddenly stabs downward hard

2ND JUROR
Look out

The blade stops about an inch from the 8th Juror’s chest The 8th
Juror does not move The 3rd Juror smiles

6TH JUROR
Thats not funny

5TH JUROR
What’s the matter with you

3RD JUROR
Now just calm down Nobody’s hurt

Right

8TH JUROR
No Nobody’s hurt

3RD JUROR
All right There’s your angle Take

a look at it Down and in That’s
how I’d stab a taller man in the
chest and that’s how it was done
Now go ahead and tell me I’m wrong

The 3rd Juror hands the knife to the 8th Juror and crosses away
“The 12th Juror crosses to the 8th Juror and using his closed hand
simulates stabbing the 8th Juror in the chest

12TH JUROR
Down and in I guess there’s no
argument

5TH JUROR

Wait a minute Give me that

The 8th Juror hands the knife to the-5th Juror He closes the
knife and holds it gingerly

5TH JUROR (CONT)
I hate these things I grew up with

them

8TH JUROR
Have you seen them used in fights

5TH JUROR
Too many of them On my stoop In my

backyard In the lot across the
street Switch knives came with the
neighborhood where I lived Funny I
wasn’t thinking of it I guess you
try to forget those things You
cant use this kind of knife that
way You have to hold it like this
FIRST DRAFT - 21496 94

5TH JUROR (CONT)
to release the blade In order to

stab downwards you would have to
change your grip —

8TH JUROR
How do you use it

5TH JUROR
Underhanded —

‘He flicks the knife open and holding it underhanded swings round
and slashes swiftly forward and upward

5TH JUROR (CONT)
Like that Anyone whos ever used a

switch knife’d never handle it any
other way

8TH JUROR
Are you sure

5TH JUROR
I’m sure

(He closes the blade and flicks
it open again)
That’s why theyre made like this

8TH JUROR
Everyone agreed that the boy is

pretty handy with a knife didn’t
they -

5TH JUROR
That’ s right

8TH JUROR
(to the 5th Juror)

Do you think he would have made the
kind of wound that killed his father

Not with the experience he’d had with

these things No I don’t think he
would He’d go for him

the room when the father was killed

5TH JUROR
No and neither was anyone else

He sticks the knife in the table and crosses away

3RD JUROR
- (to the 8th Juror)

Youre giving us a lot of mumbo-jumbo
here I don’t believe it

4TH JUROR
I don’t think you can determine what

type of wound this boy might or might
not have made simply because he knows
how to handle a knife

3RD JUROR
That’s right That‘s absolutely
right
8TH JUROR

What do you think
The 12th Juror hesitates for a moment He is confused but trying °

ever will I suppose Nine of us now
seem to feel that the defendant is
innocent but we’re just gambling on
probabilities We may be wrong We
may be trying to return a guilty man
to the community No one can really
know But we have a reasonable
doubt and this is a safeguard which
has enormous value in our system No

it’s sure We nine can’t understand

4TH JUROR

I’ll try You’ve made some excellent
points The last one in which you
“proved” that the boy couldnt have
made the kind of overhand stab would
that killed his father was very
persuasive But I still believe the
boy is guilty of murder I have two
reasons One the evidence given by
the’ woman across the street who
actually saw the murder committed

3RD JUROR
And how brother As far as I’m

concerned that’s the most important
testimonyin the whole case

4TH JUROR
And two the fact that this woman

described the stabbing by saying she
saw the boy raise his arm over his
head and plunge the knife down into
his father’s chest She saw him do
it -- the wrong way

3RD JUROR
Thats right That’s absolutely

right

4TH JUROR
Now let’s talk about this woman for

a minute She said that she went to
bed at about eleven o’clock that
night Her bed was next to the
window -- and she could look out
while lying down and see directly
into the boy’s window across the
street She tossed and turned for
over an hour unable to fall asleep
Finally she turned towards the

window at about ten minutes after

twelve and as she looked out she
saw the killing through the windows

4TH JUROR (CONT)
of the passing el train She says

that the lights went out immediately
after the killing but that she got a
good look at the boy in the act of
stabbing his father As far as I can
see this is unshakable testimony

case

I don’t know I’m guessing I’m
also guessing that she probably
didn’t put on her glasses when she
turned and looked casually out of the

the murder took place just ass he
looked out and the lights went off a
split second later She couldn’t
have had time to put glasses on then

something You lousy bunch of
bleeding hearts Youre not goin’ to
intimidate me I’m entitled to my
opinion I can sit in this goddamn
room for a year Somebody say
something

(the others watch silently)
Why doncha take that stuff about the
old man -- the old man who lived
there -- and heard everything Or
take the knife what -- just because
he -- found one like it The old man
saw him Right there on the stairs
Whats the difference how many
seconds it took What’s the
difference Every single thing The
knife falling through a hold in his
pocket - you can’t prove that he
didn’t get to the door Sure you can
hobble around the room all you want
but you can’t proveit I’m telling
you every single thing that went on
has been twisted and turned in here

EXT COURTHOUSE - DAY

The door to the courthouse building shooting from outside Rain
beats against it It begins to turn now and the jurors start to
emerge One by one they walk into the rain each reacting with his
own Maneuvers One turns up his collar One pulls down his hat
One holds a newspaper over his head They begin to move down the
steps in groups and singly now 8-is alone He walks into close-
up rain beading his face He raises his collar looks around and
then walks off The others begin to spread out now Some turning
left some right some going straight ahead Camera moves back and
up ending with a long shot through the pelting rain of the steps
and the jurors spreading out silently in all directions never to
see each other again And finally they are gone and the rain
beats down on the empty steps

‘FADE OUT

The End
