The Golem

aka Der Golem A night of stars and mysteries outlines in light some crippled buildings
their roofs put on their walls like the pointed hats on wizards Seven haloed
stars are set in the dark sky above the tallest tower reaching narrowly to
heaven

TITLE The learned Rabbi Low reads in the stars that
misfortune threatens the Jews

On the roof of the weird tower marked on each corner by a great stone Rabbi
Low sits behind an early telescope studying the constellations He is
bearded with long locks of hair

Through the eye of the telescope we sweep across the heavens

The Rabbi looks down from his instrument on its pivot and pores over a book
on alchemy He is backed by smoke and a strange light In the Rabbis study
below a glass retort bubbles on a flame Watching it is the Rabbis pale
assistant FAMULUS who looks up from his experiment at a girl MIRIAM
smiling and holding a lamp burning in her hand Her shoulders are bare her
robe is long her hair in black braids The two are in a room made of stone
blocks with a domed roof like a rough-cast observatory The girl walks
sensuously past the fire and the assistant then puts down the lamp on a
table FAMULUS gestures towards the roof above

There the Rabbi looks up from his book rises and walks across the roof
towards a stairwell

Down some curving stairs the Rabbi descends until he is standing between
MIRIAM and his assistant

TITLE I must speak with Rabbi Jehuda Danger
threatens our people

MIRIAMS face is full of pain FAMULUS runs to the back of the tower room and
returns with a tall pointed bent hat shaped like the buildings The Rabbi
puts on his magicians hat and leaves

Outside between the dark walls of the ghetto of the medieval city the Rabbi
hurries through the darkness with his assistant carrying a smoking torch

By the light of twin candles the old Rabbi JEHUDA is reading a large tome
Hearing a noise he takes off his spectacles and puts up his hand to shield

his weak eyes from the glare

Rabbi Low and his assistant are brought into the older Rabbis room by a
servant carrying a lantern

The two Rabbis strike their hearts three times in ritual woe then take each
other by the hands their faces full of foreboding Rabbi Léw warns

TITLE Call all the elders of the community together
to pray The stars predict disaster

Old JEHUDA is worried and speaks his fears as the assistant and the servant
listen Then he gives a command and all leave the room

Now two small windows shine in the blackness and three torches move across
the dark towards a gothic arch

Labyrinthine passages are seen through the arches as six men lead Jewish
worshipers towards their prayers

A Jew prays before the Menorah with a shawl over his head He strikes his
heart three times lifts up his hands and bows forwards Behind him men
kneel

in the darkness and lift their heads into the light then lean back so that
their faces are upside down They strike their hearts three times and
prostrate themselves again On a rooftop a black cat stalks the tiles in
front of a crooked chimney

The roofs of the houses curve and sidle under the stars The seven haloed
stars over the Rabbis tower shine bright then dissolve into a mailed fist
holding a written order

INSERT DECREED AGAINST THE JEWS
We can no longer neglect the complaints of the
people against the Jews They despise the holy
ceremonies of Christ They endanger the lives
and property of their fellow-men They work
black magic We decree that all Jews shall be
expelled from the city and all adjoining land
before the end of the month

IMPERATOR

Fade to the HOLY ROMAN EMPERORS face as he is clearly shown seated in state
at his court wearing rich clothes and signing the decree with a gloved and
jeweled hand When he has finished signing he picks up a large royal seal

and presses it down on some wax

The CHAMBERLAIN hands the decree to a courtier on his left who puts it into
a

couriers round satchel then hands it back to the CHAMBERLAIN who gives the
case to the EMPEROR

Three young courtiers talk as they wait with nothing to do The EMPEROR
smiles

and gestures towards the courtiers with the couriers satchel They are
aghast but one with a feather in his hat runs forward to the EMPEROR while
the others watch his temerity The EMPEROR speaks to the bold one

TITLE Knight Florian deliver our decree to the

Ghetto
As the EMPEROR smiles in front of his attendants FLORIAN takes the satchel
and turns to leave smiling his satisfaction at his friends

Fade to the hand of Rabbi Low tracing out an alchemists drawing of the
figure

of the GOLEM a mythical giant with a five-pointed star of Judah on his
breast who may be summoned by the Jews in their hour of need Hieroglyphs
cover the parchment -- instructions on how to make the giant The hand turns
over another page of parchment covered with astrological designs and crabbed
writing The Rabbi is planning

TITLE Venus enters the constellation of Libra Now
is the auspicious hour to summon the dead
spirit Astaroth and compel him to reveal the
magic word Then we can bring the Golem to life
to save our people

The fingers trace out more of the diagrams then dissolve to the Rabbis face
as he studies his book by his window He puts up his hands and rocks back
then bows forwards to the wisdom of the book

Fade to the knight FLORIAN as he rides on his white horse in front of a huge
black wall pierced by an arched gate On a watchtower a bell rings and the
watchman comes down some steep steps to look over the wall to see who is at
the gate He then hurries down FLORIAN is still horsed outside the walls

The watchman hurries down masses of winding steps until he reaches a barred
window by the gate There FLORIAN holds the sealed couriers satchel in one
hand the halter of his horse in the other hand and a rose between his
teeth

The watchman shakes his head then sees the EMPERORS seal and opens the gate
for the knight who is smiling

A doorkeeper pulls down the bar of the gate

FLORIAN now stands by his horse with his hand on his hip and his legs
crossed

the casual messenger of bad news The gate opens and a man takes the horses
halter to lead it into the city FLORIAN follows the rose between his teeth

In her chamber MIRIAM combs her dark tresses The walls are covered with
patterns of flowers and weeping leaves

In his study Rabbi Low looks up in pain from the parchment which he puts
aside He closes a large book puts it in a recess then crosses to the doors
leading into the room and locks them Restlessly he moves in and out of the
arches of the chamber Round him the glass beakers of his experiments

His passing takes him now into a dark small room with a triangular window
where he pulls aside a rug and opens a trapdoor He climbs down through it
into a secret corridor with lines on its wall ending in a triangular door
sealed with a metal strip ornamented with hieroglyphs Rabbi Léw cuts through
the seal with his knife and pushes the door open In the secret room the
Rabbi passes a diagram of the GOLEM fixed to the wall and pulls down from an
arched window a huge slab on twin cross-bars Two other diagrams of the GOLEM
are now seen near a lump of clay roughly fashioned in the shape of a giant
Rabbi Low now begins to work at the eyes of the monster pushing at the clay
and molding the face of the GOLEM

Fade to FLORIAN as the watchman leads him and his horse down the steps and
through the streets of the city Between the heavy dark walls people run
about to watch him and wait on top of the arches of the massed buildings The
EMPERORS messenger has come In his study the old Rabbi JEHUDA is ready at
his table A limping spry man comes in and taps him on his shoulder

TITLE A messenger from the Emperor is here

JEHUDA signals the man to bring in the stranger while he takes off his
glasses uncomprehending and puts his hand over his tired eyes Fade to
FLORIAN as the man brings him in to see JEHUDA The courtier hands the Rabbi
the imperial decree with a grand flourish then leans back against the middle
arch of the room crossing his ankles one hand on his hip gaily swinging
the

rose with his free hand and reading the decree over the old Jews shoulder

JEHUDA drops the scroll and puts his hands over his heart in shock He moves
beside FLORIAN and speaks to the knight who is full of disdain

TITLE Come with me to the Chief Rabbi Léw who is
like a father to our whole community

As JEHUDA is scraping and bowing FLORIAN nods The old Rabbi reaches out to
kiss the dandy knights sleeve but FLORIAN jerks away and they leave
together

Fade to the Rabbi Low kneading a mass of clay in his hands as he studies the
diagrams He turns and smears the clay on the GOLEMS face His hands work at
the features of the monster

Fade to the ghetto street outside Léws tower where FLORIAN is walking with
a
crowd leading his horse

MIRIAM is putting her hair up under a coif when she hears the noise in the
street looks out of the window and moves with joy to see the handsome
knight

below

The walls rise slant and beamed and high above FLORIAN and his horse as
the
ground swallows them up

From the street JEHUDA is made to look up by FLORIAN tapping his shoulder

MIRIAM leans out of her window looking down and smiling FLORIAN looks up
and
waves his rose at her MIRIAM looks down in delight

Beside the knight JEHUDA gestures towards the door of the house MIRIAM nods
and draws her head back inside the window Below the old Rabbi explains to
FLORIAN who the girl is Inside Léws study MIRIAM runs over to the
assistant

FAMULUS and tells him of the arrival of the EMPERORS messenger As he runs
off she folds her arms and sighs

In his secret room the Rabbi Léw works on the GOLEMS clay face now smooth
and humanoid He looks upwards then moves over to the arched window He
places the slab over it plunging the room into darkness Then he opens the
door of the room letting in the light as he goes out Finally he closes the
door on the GOLEM in its black sepulcher

Fade to Léws study where the assistant ushers in the haughty FLORIAN and the
old JEHUDA When Low comes in he bows and takes the knight back through an
arch to a dark recess where there are some heavy curved chairs set under
stalactites which grow out of shell-like niches As FLORIAN toys with his
rose the Chief Rabbi speaks

TITLE It was I who drew the Emperors horoscope I
warned him of danger twice Tell him now that I
humbly ask for an audience with him

FLORIAN smiles and nods while the two Rabbis speak together MIRIAM comes in
holding a large goblet and a bowl of fruit which she sets on a table before
offering the goblet to the knight In answer to her smile FLORIAN grins
toothily showing the gap between his front teeth

MIRIAM looks away smiling then lowers her lids in false shyness The two
Rabbis look at each other then off at the two young people MIRIAM now
drinks

out of the goblet herself before offering it to the knight who slyly turns
the goblet round to kiss the brim and drink out of the same place as she did
He gives his rose to the girl She plays with it softly

Fade again to the starry night sky with the seven stars haloed in the
heavens

then dissolve to a star of David made of cracked clay then dissolve to the
powerful face and shoulders of the finished GOLEM its eyes closed crowned
by

amass of clay hair Léw stands with his hand on the standing monsters
chest

propped against the wall of his secret room

TITLE The hour has come

He looks up at the diagram then bends to pull the GOLEM forward He takes
its

weight on his shoulder struggles then pushes the clay monster back upright

His heart has been strained so he massages it before leaving the room

FAMULUS is heating a prong at the forge when the trapdoor opens behind him
and
Low appears The Rabbis assistant drops the hot iron in terror as his
master
comes up behind him and takes him by the shoulders and speaks

TITLE Guard this secret with your life

The assistant rolls his eyes as the Rabbi takes his hand and leads him over
to
the trapdoor

TITLE Knight Florian brings the Emperors answer

FLORIAN rides into the ghetto and stops between two rows of houses with
gables

hanging askew aslant He claps his hands and a man appears at a high window
He waves a sheet of parchment and people run up to the EMPERORS messenger
on

his horse

In his secret room Léw demonstrates the GOLEM to his assistant pointing to
the star of David on the monsters chest then to the diagram on the wall
FAMULUS rolls his eyes with wonder and terror

In the study MIRIAM shows FLORIAN to a carved bench As she tries to leave
he catches her hand and draws her down beside him Their breathing quickens
their lips near his hand touches her breast her hands cover his before
ending on his chest Faint with desire the pair lean back on the bench

Fade to Léw and his assistant struggling with the body of the GOLEM up the
steep corridor The wrapped head of the monster is pushed through the
trapdoor

Back on the bench FLORIAN keeps his hand over MIRIAMS heart as he whispers
in her ear and she smiles

Fade to FAMULUS unwrapping the head of the GOLEM He and the Rabbi push the
monster towards the arched doorway Léw moves over to the triangular window
to
look out He sees below The white horse being led up and down between two
rows of people and the narrow walls of the ghetto

Seeing everybodys attention safely elsewhere Léw locks the doors of the
room
while his assistant closes the trapdoor

Fade back to the couple on the carved bench with their arms round each other
Rabbi Low comes on his face full of worry The couple spring up as he passes
and FLORIAN gives him the parchment with an embarrassed flourish

As MIRIAM backs away her finger to her lips the Rabbi reads the scroll
INSERT In memory of your services we will grant you an
audience Come to the Festival at the Castle

and amuse us again with your magical arts

FLORIAN and the ecstatic MIRIAM glance at each other
Rabbi Low looks up from the scroll smiling He speaks to FLORIAN who puts
on

is hat and walks grinning past MIRIAM The Rabbi passes her and scowls and
follows the knight out of the room MIRIAM runs over to the window

Outside the tower FLORIAN appears with the Rabbi and takes the halter of his
orse The people watch below the tall buildings MIRIAM backs away from the
window and cowers her arm over her head expecting punishment When Léw
comes

back into the room he lectures her as she shakes her head He points towards
the bench but she still denies his charges So he takes her wrists forces
er to kneel and grips her by the neck threatening her

TITLE You shame me but I will soon have a guardian
for you

The Rabbi stops throttling the frightened MIRIAM who presses her face
against
his legs in submission

On a road over a bridge FLORIAN rides his horse outlined against the sky

Lows hand opens the leather cover of a book intricately decorated Inside
a

drawing of the GOLEM with crabbed writing at its side On the other page a
German text

INSERT This figure called the Golem was made long
ago by a magician of Thessaly If you place the
magic word in the amulet on its breast it will
live and breathe as long as it wears it

Fade from the open book to Léw and his assistant poring over it then fade
again to them as the assistant looks up in fear and the Rabbi tells him to be
brave Léw closes the book and picks up a hollow Star of David and a piece of
paper Then he opens another old tome and reads its text

INSERT Astaroth guards the magic word which can give
life even today He who possesses the key of
Solomon can force Astaroth to reveal the word
if he observes the due hour of the meeting of
the planets

The Rabbi looks at his assistant as he closes the old book He takes the Star
of David and folds up the pieces of paper to fit the hollow inside the star

On the chest of the GOLEM there is a clay circle waiting for the star
Loéw moves towards the monster while his frightened assistant lags behind
his

hands over his face Léw forces the hands of FAMULUS apart so that he must
watch the Rabbi pointing to the circle on the GOLEMS chest

Now the Rabbi wears his wizards hat ornamented with cabbalistic symbols and
the Star of David He has a wand in his hand which he brings down raises
brings down FAMULUS watches rigid with terror

Low continues with his magic ceremony drawing a circle about him with the
wand Fade to him now standing within a ring of fire He pulls his assistant
into the charmed circle and suddenly a clay Star of David appears at the end
of his wand while he waves thrice FAMULUS grips his master in fear

Three lighted torches flare above the Rabbi and his assistant in their ring
of

flames FAMULUS begins to faint and slide to the floor while the Rabbi also
weakens sinks down holding the clay star above him

TITLE Astaroth Astaroth appear appear Speak the
word

Lows face is distorted as he holds up the clay star A demons head appears
by the Rabbi and his assistant It burns and floats its forehead huge above
its bulging white eyes smoke curling from its black lips

Loéw cries out in fear
From the mouth of Astaroth the smoke writes the magic word AEMAET

Now the clay star blazes at the end of the Rabbis wand and he throws it
outside the circle of fire Then he pulls off his wizards hat and staggers
round the ring of flames trying to get out Finally he collapses his arms
stretched wide as the center of the circle explodes in a flash of white
light

As the smoke clears the Rabbi is seen crouching over his unconscious
assistant

Outside the tower the smoke flies up to the sky from a small window

Inside his room Léw drags FAMULUS over to a bench shakes him and wakens
him

He points at the paper in his hand and the clay figure of the GOLEM FAMULUS
tries to stop his master but Léw seizes the pen dips it in ink and begins
to

write The thick quill writes out the word AEMAET

The Rabbi finishes writing then runs over to the GOLEM and signals FAMULUS
to

help him move the monster The two of them stand the GOLEM in front of some
crooked steps The Rabbi puts the paper inside the hollow Star of David then
screws it into a socket inside the clay circle in the GOLEMS chest

Immediately the eyelids of the GOLEM open his clay head moves as FAMULUS
backs away The GOLEMS face is blank its eyes open and white the mask of

clay hiding any form of intelligence The Rabbi looks at his creation

The GOLEM turns its mouth severe It has ropes tied on its arms narrow legs
and heavy shoes

The assistant crouches on the steps ready to run

The GOLEM looks at Léw who backs away Then it rocks its eyes staring wide
It moves forwards swinging its legs clumsily like lead weights on poles As
it reaches the Rabbi Low orders the monster to stop It does stop Then the
Rabbi orders the GOLEM to walk away It obeys him knocking over the
assistant

who happens to be in its way Then it halts on Lows order

Hesitant and fearful Léw approaches his monster and pulls the Star of David
out of its socket The eyes of the GOLEM Shut it rocks on its feet and falls
back against the wall The Rabbi and his assistant look at the lifeless
monster then begin to praise the Lord

Now the GOLEM is seen swinging an axe then by a well splitting logs One
blow is enough to cut a huge log in half

Two men look down watching the GOLEM at work below their window

Four children peep over the wall at the toiling monster The GOLEM moves with
the logs then looks upwards Its master the Rabbi is leaning out of his
tower window The GOLEM stumps up to the well The Rabbi signals with his
arm

The GOLEM nods twice jerkily unties the well rope and begins to pull up a
bucket of water

Inside his tower room Léw turns to sit at his table by the window while
MIRIAM rushes in to point out the monster at work The GOLEM pulls a bucket
of

water from the well

In the room MIRIAM is upset but the Rabbi lays down the law
TITLE This is my new servant Golem

MIRIAM looks fearful and glances out of the window

TITLE The Golems first appearance on the street

FAMULUS comes out of a small archway in a timbered wall signaling the huge
GOLEM to follow him with a large basket The monster looks pleased at its
first sight of the ghetto Now it moves between the high walls making two
men

flee for their lives But some children run up to it and skip around it
while

it swings its basket at them Now the children run down some steps while
mothers pull their babies away from the passing monster and the Rabbis
assistant

In an apothecarys shop a man and a woman and a boy are working over a table
scattered with herbs The door is pushed open by the GOLEM which knocks over
a stool and stands by the counter The three people in the shop are
terrified

The monster reaches into its basket for its shopping list and stiffly holds
the list out in its gloved fist Now FAMULUS runs into the shop to explain
As
he does so the GOLEM turns to glare at the hated assistant

TITLE This is the Rabbis new servant He cannot
speak but he will not hurt you He will come
to you every day with a list of the articles
we need

On the assistants signal the man and the woman begin to pull down the herbs
from racks above

Fade to FLORIAN now standing by the city gate and arguing with the watchman
He puts a folded letter between his teeth so that he can bring up his purse
and drop coins one by one over his shoulder into the watchmans open palm
Five coins complete the bribe The watchmans hand takes the note and
FLORIAN

grins his delight

Fade to the Rabbis laboratory where FAMULUS is leading in the GOLEM who is
carrying the herbs and the basket and other loads The assistant smiles and
takes the herbs from the monster but it will not give up the basket The
assistant backs away telling the GOLEM to put out its arm It does so with a
jerk nearly knocking FAMULUS over but now he can get the basket from the
monster The assistant tries to get more work from the GOLEM He taps down
the
monsters arm then takes it over to the spit where there is a large bellows
worked by a handle over the fire FAMULUS demonstrates how to work the handle
which the GOLEM does with such vigor that the assistant has to leap from the
flare of the flames fanned by the bellows

Low watches the comedy considering
The assistant runs from the room as the GOLEM makes the fire spurt high

FAMULUS runs up to the Rabbi who walks over to the monster and raises his
hand in a curt command The GOLEM stops working the bellows and leaves the
room at Léws order The Rabbi turns to his assistant

TITLE Today I go to show the Golem to the Emperor
Stay and guard my house

Low moves across to speak to the GOLEM which follows its master out leaving
the assistant behind

ade to a high tower and a wall with MIRIAM entering her scarf blowing in

e wind her arms held high She walks over to another tower more leaning
an Pisas and meets the watchman there He hands the folded letter to her
nd disappears while she opens it smiles to read it folds it up and kisses
e words of her lover

ataedday

Fade into a road over a bridge where the Rabbi is leading the GOLEM towards
e EMPEROR

ca

TITLE The Rose Festival
Four trumpeters stand on a balcony festooned with banners hanging from stags
horns They blow their brass notes to north east south and west

In the EMPERORS hall two rows of men with torches two rows of girls in
bright dresses dance and whirl to the music

Above them six musicians puff and blow wind instruments from a balcony
The men dance with their torches held high

The courtiers round the EMPERORS throne link arms and sway to the music A
jester mocks the girl with the EMPEROR

FLORIAN runs out of the hall

Two tall knights with feathered helmets stand on either side of an open heavy
door through which FLORIAN comes closing it behind him before dashing off

The dancing men still whirl with their torches

Fade to MIRIAM bare-shouldered under her turban as she reads FLORIANS
letter

INSERT At the time chosen by the Emperor to see your
father I will leave the castle and come to you
I have bribed the watchman Place a light in
your window as a sign that you are waiting for
me Florian

MIRIAMS face is hot in the lamplight as she closes her eyes and puts her
forehead to the letter

Fade back to the dancers as they part holding their torches high The two
knights at the heavy door stop the Rabbi and the GOLEM as they enter Léw
explains the reason for his coming and is allowed to enter More knights
cluster round the GOLEM staring at it

In the hall Low walks towards the EMPEROR He looks strange in his dark
cloa
and pointed wizards hat He bows low before the EMPEROR and kisses his ring
The EMPEROR pats him condescending while the jester leers

Two beautiful girls with jeweled circlets on their foreheads smile then
suddenly go white with fear to see

The GOLEM towering and blinking by the door

Now the EMPEROR and his girl see the monster The EMPEROR asks Low about it
and is impressed The Rabbi raises his hand

The GOLEM moves down the hall between the dancers who fall back in fear
One of the musicians stops playing and stares with a slack mouth then taps

the shoulder of another musician whose mouth also drops open The music from
the balcony stops The EMPERORS guests draw back in terror

The GOLEM moves down the hall straight at the EMPERORS throne Three girls
shrink back crouching on the floor

The GOLEM comes to a halt before its creator and the EMPEROR Rabbi Low
explains

TITLE He is my creature called Golem I may not
tell you more

As the Rabbi and the EMPEROR move away girls surround the GOLEM like a
plaything Greatly daring one girl touches its cheek It snaps back at her
and all the girls dart back Now another girl shrugs and offers the monster a
flower It looks at the flower in its hand then slowly reaches out to touch
the girls head in gratitude But the girls dart away from its touch and it
stares after this beauty vanishing lost Its face is sad as it learns its
own

horror

Fade to FLORIAN creeping back across the road bridge

Fade back to the Rabbi the EMPEROR and the GOLEM The EMPERORS girl elbows
the monster but it does not move She stands smiling her triumph at her
lover while he turns to put a hand on Léws shoulder

TITLE What kind of miracle can you show us today
you strange magician

As the EMPEROR folds his arms the Rabbi becomes grave and raises his hands
and his eyes towards heaven

TITLE I will show you the history of our people and
our fathers If you value your lives no one
must speak nor laugh

The EMPEROR smiles and shouts to the guests and waves his hand above his
head
They toss flowers in the air and laugh their pleasure

Fade to FLORIAN running into the dark arch of the doorway of Lows tower He
stops to look upwards MIRIAM appears in a white gown and pulls him inside
In

a dark hall of the tower a single lamp shines on MIRIAM pausing to sink into
the knights arms and kiss him Then she leads him on into the darkness

FAMULUS lies asleep at a table the Rabbis books open in front of him

Fade back to the EMPERORS COURT where all are seated with their backs to us
while Rabbi Low stands on a platform Behind him stone branches weave in and
around a niche in the wall The Rabbi raises his hands There is an explosion
of white flame Fiery particles shoot out and scare the EMPERORS guests

Now the Rabbi raises his hands again There is a flare of light and as the
guests wonder we see two lines of people toiling across the desert
Now superimposed over the EMPERORS hall we see the three Wise Kings Mary
on

the donkeys back with the Christ child and the wandering tribes of Israel
Lows eyes burn as he summons up the history of the Jews The people about
the

EMPEROR all watch intently

In a group round a young man a girl whispers He puts a finger to his lips
to

hush her

The musicians in the balcony stare downwards

The GOLEM watches the magic show between two of the EMPERORS knights

Now Moses appears superimposed over the imperial hall The jester giggles and
nudges the EMPERORS girl Then he grimaces and makes her laugh This makes
the EMPEROR laugh Following their masters lead all the courtiers laugh as
the jester waves them on to more derision

Moses walks towards the mocking guests his staff threatening them

Loéw raises his hands in an incantation

Moses looms over the laughing courtiers

Lows face is fearful

Now Moses towers over the EMPEROR himself He conjures up a lightning flash
Smoke fills the hall

Seven frightened faces stare up like the haloed stars

Above them three ceiling beams fall down between the pillars of the hall
Dust showers the milling mob of courtiers

The beams slide further down between the pillars

The courtiers panic fight choke in the dust

The musicians cower on the balcony

The beams crush still further down on the people

The GOLEM stands at the door of the hall its arms spread blocking the way
out One frightened girl kneels in front of it begging its mercy but the
GOLEM shakes its head and bars the door A beam falls off its shoulder and
crashes down on a man The rest shrink back

Other beams fall about the frantic jester and the frightened courtiers who
begin to attack one another and fight their way out Rabbi Low stays standing
by the EMPEROR and his girl The courtiers attack each other to scramble out
of holes in the cracking walls and windows

Now outside the hall people are seen falling out of the windows between the
great pillars which support the palace

Loéw stretches up his hands to heaven as more courtiers panic by the EMPEROR
who seizes the Rabbi and shakes him from his trance

TITLE Save me and I will pardon your people

The Rabbi smiles faintly and reaches out his hand and cries out to his
monster

By the door the GOLEM nods and moves from the main doorway As the Rabbi and
the EMPEROR and the courtiers move away the ceiling falls where they have
been standing They step their way over the prostrate wounded to where the
GOLEM lurches up onto a stone platform and puts his shoulders and hands under
some fallen beams The monster strains mightily at the falling roof The
beams

part into a triangle of escape for the people crouching behind including the
Rabbi and the EMPEROR

Fade to the road bridge across which the Rabbi is returning with his
monster

Now FLORIAN is seen with his head on MIRIAMS breast as she lies back on her
pillows the two drapes of her bed in a triangle of escape behind her

Now fade to a tall arched gate in the city wall where Léw pulls the cord of
the bell while the GOLEM waits

The watchman is asleep in the bell tower while a bird is asleep on the bell
itself As the bell rings the bird flies off and the watchman springs up
looks over the wall and rushes off down some steps The gate opens to let in
the Rabbi and the GOLEM The Rabbi tells the watchman the good news his hand
on the others shoulder

TITLE We are saved The Emperor has withdrawn his
decree Wake my sleeping brothers with the
glad sound of the Schofa horn

The smiling watchman kisses Léws sleeve then leads him and the GOLEM into
the city

Fade to MIRIAMS bed where she is asleep with FLORIAN on the floor beside
her She wakes in fear and rouses FLORIAN who is also afraid She rises from
her bed in her long white nightgown her black braids reaching nearly to her
ankles Her lover holds her gown and the curtains of the bed then lets her
free to go to the window Below in the courtyard Rabbi Léw and the GOLEM go
towards their tower while the watchman runs back up the steps to sound the
horn from the ghetto wall

MIRIAM comes back fearfully from the window takes FLORIANS hand then locks
the door of her bedroom

The Rabbi leads his monster back into his study takes off his hat and cloak
then turns to put his hand on the GOLEMS shoulder It stares at him with
sudden hatred Léw slowly takes back his hand The GOLEM sneers one white
eye

ablaze

Low slowly reaches for the Star of David on the monsters chest but it holds
its clay hand over its source of life

The Rabbi backs away from his creation then crouches over a table The
GOLEMS face convulses with fury its teeth bared The Rabbi cowers at the
table

The monster raises its hand ready to strike It moves round behind the
Rabbi

but it is too slow Léw pulls out the Star of David from its chest and it
drops its hand rocks and falls back lifeless Now the Rabbi crouches down by
his unmoving monster and puts his hand on its clay face

From the ghetto wall the watchman blows the Schofa horn
A man pokes his head out of a small window

As the horn sounds again men talk from the windows The horn sounds yet
again A woman appears at a little window then a thin man in a doorway
shorter than he is He joins three other men dressed like himself in pointed
hats and black gowns Women gather around them and wave at the ghetto wall
The horn sounds again There is general excitement as the Jews come out into
the streets One man stands on a platform waving his hands in the air while
the crowd surrounds him

TITLE Let us rejoice

The crowd begins to dance throw their hats away shout

The watchman sounds his horn yet again

A group of men run down to help the old Rabbi JEHUDA to climb some steps

Fade to FAMULUS the Rabbis assistant as he wakes from his sleep and
hurries
to the window then returns to his bed to put his coat on

Fade to the Rabbi reading from his old books of magic with the clay figure of
the GOLEM stretched out at his feet His hands trace out the German text

INSERT If you have brought the dead to life through
magic beware When Uranus comes into the House
of the Planets Astaroth will take back his
creature Then the dead clay will scorn its
Master and destroy him and all living things
The Rabbi looks down from his book at the lying monster

TITLE Your work Golem is done Turn to lifeless
clay again before the powers of darkness take
their revenge

Low closes his book rises and picks up a large wooden mallet ready to smash
the GOLEM to pieces But FAMULUS runs in and stops him

TITLE Master Jehuda waits below with the elders to
escort you to the Synagogue for the Ceremony
of Thanksgiving

Léw looks off with his assistant to see

Twelve men carrying the Ark of the Covenant between them on long poles They
are surrounded by other men blowing the Schofa horns with people kneeling
about them

In her bedroom above MIRIAM pushes FLORIAN back from the light into the
shadows They hold each other in fear and love looking wildly for an escape
She counsels him

TITLE After all have gone steal through that gate

MIRIAM points the direction to FLORIAN then sinks back in his arms

Rabbi Léw comes through a low arch to meet old JEHUDA and go with him into
the

street FAMULUS watches the two men leave Out in the streets of the ghetto
the jammed people wave and shout between the tall crooked buildings

Waving tall fans in the shape of palm-leaves the people part to let the Ark
of the Covenant pass along the narrow street FAMULUS watches the procession
smiling from Léws doorway

The procession moves on towards the Synagogue

Fade to MIRIAM and her lover crouched by the window of her room Fade back
to

FAMULUS as the crowd moves off after the Ark He runs after them then runs
back below the tower struck by a happy thought

TITLE I will be the first to bring the glad news to
Miriam

He runs into the doorway Then he runs up to the door outside MIRIAMs room
and bangs the metal ring on the wood to warn her MIRIAM runs to press
herself

against the bedroom door and listen She holds out a hand to hush FLORIAN

FAMULUS shouts his excitement to her on the other side of the door She
shouts
back shaking her head
TITLE I am not ready Go And I will follow

She shouts shaking her head with her eyes closed

FAMULUS holds onto the ring on the door He is gay and persuasive
TITLE No I will wait and take you to the Synagogue

He grins and leans sighing back against the room wall FLORIAN rushes across
to speak with MIRIAM She silences him with a hand across his mouth but he
whispers on The smile of FAMULUS outside the door begins to fade Inside the
room the lovers whisper before MIRIAM puts her hand again over FLORIANS
mouth

FAMULUS presses his ear against the locked door then draws back his eyes
wild

Inside the room the lovers clutch each other knowing they are discovered

FAMULUS is mad with jealousy He runs off in the Rabbis study and searches

for the Star of David Once it is found he bends to screw it into the lying
GOLEMS chest The monster rises stiff and upright to its feet It sneers

at

the dazed FAMULUS As it lurches towards him he points off with both of his
hands and he shouts

TITLE There is a stranger in there who has brought
shame upon us Seize him

As FAMULUS rages so the GOLEMS wrath grows It lurches forwards making the
Rabbis assistant cower back Then it marches to the closed door and hammers
the wood with its fist

Inside the room the lovers shrink together

The GOLEM pounds on the door

The couple cringe

e GOLEM looks at the assistant who mimes the action of smashing his arms
rough the wood

ca

The GOLEM crashes its fists straight through the door
MIRIAM faints into her lovers arms

The GOLEM pushes in the door as FAMULUS leans against the wall and grins
Then

the monster moves to look into the room while the Rabbis assistant sidles
into the doorway to watch the fun over the GOLEMS shoulder

FLORIAN notices something at his feet while MIRIAM lies swooning in his
arms

The GOLEM bares his teeth while the assistant shows his own teeth with a
grin
FLORIAN leaves MIRIAM on the ground then leans down to seize a dagger lying
on the floor among the splintered panels from the wrecked door

He leaps at the GOLEM and stabs it The dagger breaks in his hand and the
monster cuffs him away

The GOLEM lumbers over to MIRIAM and grabs her long braids
FLORIAN pulls her away and attacks the GOLEM which gives him a violent blow

FAMULUS turns smiling to the girl on the ground FLORIAN tries to escape down
the steps through the hall But the GOLEM pursues him blocking his escape

FLORIAN runs up the flight of curving stairs that leads to the roof

FAMULUS grabs MIRIAM by the arm but she rouses herself and begins to
struggle She breaks free and runs out followed by her attacker

On the top of the tower between the great stones at each corner the tiny
figure of FLORIAN appears running from his doom He crouches in the corner
of

the tower the broken dagger in his hand

The head of the ravening GOLEM appears through the small opening in the tower
roof It is as much clay as the tiles

FLORIAN crouches ready to defend himself

The GOLEM is berserk

It stalks the knight across the tower roof

It seizes him as he struggles

It carries him to the edge of the drop

It throws him over

From beneath the tower we see the GOLEM staring downwards

Now we look down on the broken body of FLORIAN who has been smashed to death
on the logs split by the monster in the shadow of the tower

MIRIAM runs up the curving stairs to the tower roof Behind her the
assistant

She puts her head through the hole in the roof then shrieks and shrinks back
against FAMULUS who is also cowering with terror

The girl and the assistant now run out onto the roof The GOLEM knocks the
assistant down and seizes the girl

It carries her down the winding stairs

She lies fainting in the monsters arms It lays her out on a table in the
Rabbis study then puts its hands on her face and looks closely at her
Slowly the GOLEM passes a huge clay hand over MIRIAMS throat over her
breasts over her hip

It stares down its mouth slashed in a strange smile It looks down curious
intent Its eyes roll white in their sockets

The assistant runs down the tower stairs pauses then runs on MIRIAM looks
up then faints again

The GOLEM holds the girls head in its hands its face close to hers FAMULUS
runs in stops reaches slowly for the Star of David on the monsters breast

But the GOLEM puts one huge hand over the talisman

It pushes the assistant back with its free hand while MIRIAM stirs on the
table

It lifts a huge fist

MIRIAM shrieks from the table

The GOLEM rages in front of the assistant who puts up his hands like claws
in

front of his white face Then he runs at the monster which beats him to the
ground and seizes a burning log from the fire

MIRIAM falls off the table in another faint

The monster threatens FAMULUS with the burning brand then puts the flame to
the bottom of the stairs

One of the Rabbis chemical jars explodes and fire licks up about the steps

The GOLEM rages through the blazing room It seizes MIRIAM by her braids
drags her off

Smoke billows out of the tower window

The GOLEM stares at the flames It picks up a blazing piece of wood and
brandishes it the girls hair still knotted in its other hand

Fade to candles burning over JEHUDA and Léw and a third Rabbi as they pray
over their Holy Book in the Synagogue Behind them a host of hands reaching
up like candle flames in the darkness Through the bowing worshipers FAMULUS
forces his way until he is stopped He speaks wildly moves on

Some old men in the Synagogue whisper and mutter

The assistant is now speaking to his master and JEHUDA

TITLE Your house is on fire The Golem is berserk

While FAMULUS speaks the Rabbis bow to the altar

The old men begin to push their way out
The crowd now begins to jostle its way out followed by the Rabbis
The street outside Léws tower is now jammed with the crowd
Smoke pours out of the tower window

The GOLEM stands in a fiery arch the braids of the girl knotted round its
fist It lurches on dragging her behind it

Below the tower the crowd watches as the roof catches ablaze
FAMULUS runs on with Léw and JEHUDA and some of the crowd behind him They
stop to stare at more broken bodies lying on the stairs below the fiery arch

A raving man is caught by Low and his assistant

TITLE The demon has carried Miriam away It is
destroying everything

The raving man looks up to see with the others
White smoke pouring from the dark walls

We look down now from the high roofs onto the packed crowd milling in the
street below Smoke drifts through the air

The Jews sink to their knees on the stairs imploring their Chief Rabbi Léw
TITLE Rabbi save us or we shall all be destroyed
The Rabbi nods then climbs the steps between the people and stands framed by

the arch in front of the smoke He bids all kneel then goes on himself into
the inferno his arms raised above his head

The GOLEM is now dragging MIRIAM by the hair across a field of stones in
front

of a huge wall held up by buttresses of boulders

Flames blaze from an arch in the burning ghetto

Low appears in front of his burning tower his arms held high

A thatched roof is ripped by flame

The people kneel and pray between the burning buildings

The Rabbi prays to heaven amid the clouds of smoke

Thick smoke billows from the tower fills the street

The people rise and fall in their prayers

The timbers blaze above them

Smoke blots out the praying Jews

The Rabbi is also lost in the smoke
His tower falls in a pillar of fire
The whole ghetto smokes like Gomorrah
The Rabbi moves his arms in circles begging his God

The GOLEM drags MIRIAM over to a smooth rock in front of a ridged wall It
lays her out on this sacrificial altar

It bends over her then looks about itself wildly then bends to look at the
girl again She does not move It does not understand It shakes its head
lumbers away

The Rabbi finishes his prayers then leaves through a dark arch in front of
the pointed roofs of the town

MIRIAM opens her eyes weakly then faints again on her rock
High on the ridged wall Low appears He looks down and sees MIRIAM He runs
down some curving steps and embraces her He pulls her up to him strokes her

face

The people rise and fall in prayer as JEHUDA and other Jews move through the
crowd embracing each other joyful JEHUDA speaks

TITLE Let us show our gratitude to the great Rabbi Low

Led by the Rabbis the crowd moves between the high walls shouting and
running

Fade to Loéw and MIRIAM on the stone as FAMULUS comes up to them

TITLE Rabbi Léw the people have come to thank you
for saving them

The Rabbi rises and takes his leave while the assistant sits by the girl and
takes her hand As she looks away in shame he speaks

TITLE The Rabbis tower has fallen and the stranger
is buried in its ruins No one knows nor
suspects I shall be silent for ever Will you
pardon me

MIRIAM turns and buries her head in the assistants neck

By the great city gates the GOLEM appears It stares from side to side then
moves on It stops by the gates to look through a small window It sees
outside the walls

Pretty children in wispy dresses playing in the sun One lifts another up to
put flowers on the top of a statue of a child on a column Now the children

dance in a circle outside the great gates

The GOLEM pushes at the gates
The children stop their play to watch and listen

The GOLEM strains at the gates The beam holding the doors together breaks in
two The monster opens the gates in the bright sunlight outside the ghetto

The children are frightened They turn and run away their dresses floating
flowers in their hair

One small child stays where it is and bursts into tears
Slowly the GOLEM comes out of the gate The monster stares and smiles gently

A small girl sits on the ground looking curiously back She has one shoulder
bare

The GOLEM lumbers over to stand in front of the little girl who rises to
look
at the monster She offers it an apple

The GOLEM picks her up holds her against its chest

The little girl puts the apple into the GOLEMS mouth It smiles and looks
around She drops the apple plays with the Star of David on the monsters
chest

Easily simply her fingers take out the Star drop it on the ground
The GOLEM lets the little girl fall rocks crashes down

The little girl stands at the feet of the lifeless monster She jumps over
its

huge shoes of clay and runs to its clay head She waves to the other
children

then runs off

Fade to the crowd pressing forwards to see Rabbi Low with the wizards hats
of the pointed ghetto roofs askew behind Léw raises his head from the
blessing of the old Rabbi JEHUDA then asks the question all wish to ask

TITLE But where is the Golem

The crowd begins to split up to start the search

The little girl leads on the other children to play with the fallen GOLEM
They swarm all over the huge body of the monster poking it feeling the
clay

The little girl shows them the Star of David

The talisman is passed through the childrens hands

Then the Star is tossed in the air thrown away lost

Inside the ghetto the watchman rushes up to Rabbi Low
TITLE The gate has been broken open The Golem is by
there

He leads Léw and the crowd off

The children now sit on the GOLEMS body in rows Their hands are full of
flowers flowery its body

Now from the gate of the city the Rabbi and the dark crowd come The
children

rise and run away from the monster while Léw and the Jews surround the
fallen

GOLEM in a half-circle of black figures Low raises his hands and face yet
again to God

TITLE Praise Jehovah for He has shown His love for
His people three times today

Loéw drops his hands and the crowd kneels in the half-circle and all along the
line of people stretching back to the great gates of the city The Rabbi
motions some men to rise

Ten of them pick up the GOLEM Its body is stiff and heavy as clay They
carry
it back towards the gates

From outside the curving walls of the medieval city we see the body of the
GOLEM carried in below the watch tower The gates close on the procession On
the black walls a white clay Star of David appears and then it becomes a
white star in the darkness of the heavens
