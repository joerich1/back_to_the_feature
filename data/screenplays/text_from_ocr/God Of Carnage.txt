GOD OF CARNAGE

March 5 2010
EXT PLAYGROUND IN PARK SLOPE - DAY 1

WIDE ANGLE VIEW A playground in Brooklyn A winter sun
shines brightly Stark trees and patchy grass

A boy of about 10 years stands apart from a group of kids
his age

In his hand he is holding a large piece of tree branch
twirling it absently with the thick end out for his own
amusement

Another boy with the support of the group starts shouting
abuse at him Though the words aren’t audible it’s clear
that things are getting tense

A verbal exchange is followed by some threatening gestures
on both sides One boy shoves the other shoves back

It’s all pretty unremarkable until the first boy
practically reflexively strikes the second with the branch

The wounded child is doubled over his face in his hands
The others crowd around him

The boy who hit him also starts to take a step toward the
group of children He seems distraught

INT LONGSTREET APARTMENT - DEN - DAY 2

A narrow room converted to a home office Winter light
filters through the only window

On a table against one wall there are some periodicals -
topical magazines about contemporary history and UNESCO
publications There are also some assorted papers a school
notebook a few baubles and a laptop computer

PENELOPE LONGSTREET is seated at the computer

Her husband MICHAEL is standing by amiably leaning over
and already prepared for the words which are to follow

Also standing there but a couple of steps back are ALAN
and NANCY COWAN They are dressed in business clothes She
must have put her coat down somewhere he has his on his
arm They both stare at the screen

It is clear from the start that these two couples are not
close The prevailing mood is serious cordial and tolerant

PENELOPE reads out loud the words written on the screen
PENELOPE

“January 11 at 530 PM”

(with a glance behind

her toward the

COWANS )
You’1ll make your statement
separately this is ours
“following a verbal dispute in the
Third Street Playground Zachary
Cowan age eleven and armed with a
stick struck our son Ethan
Longstreet in the face In addition
to the swelling and bruising of
Ethans upper lip this act also
resulted in two broken incisors
including nerve damage to the right
incisor

ALAN
Armed

PENELOPE
Armed You dont like armed Michael
what could we say Carrying Holding
Carrying a stick is that all right

ALAN
Carrying yeah

MICHAEL
Carrying a stick

PENELOPE enters the correction on the laptop

PENELOPE
Carrying

She prints the single page and hands it to NANCY COWAN

PENELOPE (CONTD)
Its ironic we always thought the
Third Street Playground was safe
Compared to the Park

MICHAEL
True

Once the paper is in his wife’s hand ALAN COWAN tries to
cut the meeting short starts backing up toward the foyer

They continue talking as all make their way progressively
toward the front door
MICHAEL (CONTD)
We always said Third Street
playground fine Prospect Park no
way

PENELOPE
Only goes to show But hey thank you
for coming Its so much better than
getting caught up in that adversarial
mindset

NANCY
Well we thank you Really

PENELOPE
I dont think we have to thank each
other Fortunately some of us still
have a sense of community right

ALAN
Though the kids havent got that
notion straight yet I mean our kid

NANCY
Right our kid

The LONGSTREETS deftly lead the COWANS into the living room

INT LONGSTREET LIVING ROOM - DAY 3

The LONGSTREET’s living room is modest and homey There’s a
partial view of the elevated subway The furnishings are
improvised and disparate with a few ethnic touches There
is a large bookshelf

A few chairs and a sofa are arranged around a coffee table
covered with art books

There is a large bouquet of tulips in a transparent vase

The LONGSTREETS sit down and NANCY follows their lead ALAN
remains standing

NANCY
What about the tooth with the damaged
nerve

PENELOPE

Oh they dont know Theres still
some question about the prognosis
Apparently the nerve is not
completely exposed

MICHAEL
Only part of it is exposed
PENELOPE
Right Theres a part thats exposed
and a part thats still protected
So for right now theyre not going
to devitalize it

MICHAEL

They want to give the tooth a chance
PENELOPE

We would so like to avoid root canal
NANCY

Of course
PENELOPE

So theres an observation period
while they give the nerve a chance to
heal

MICHAEL
Meantime hes going to need caps

PENELOPE
You cant have implants until youre
eighteen anyway

MICHAEL
You cant

PENELOPE
The permanent implants can only be
done once you reach maturity

NANCY
Naturally I hope I hope it all
turns out all right

PENELOPE
We can only hope

A slightly uncomfortable beat

NANCY
Those tulips are gorgeous

PENELOPE
Its that little florist way up by
Sullivan You know The one all the
way up

NANCY
Oh right

PENELOPE
They fly the bulbs in straight from
Holland twenty dollars a load of
fifty
NANCY
That a fact
PENELOPE
You know the one All the way up
NANCY
Right right
PENELOPE

You know he didnt want to tell on
Zachary

MICHAEL
No he didnt want to

PENELOPE
It was incredible to see This child
with no face left no teeth and he
just wouldnt talk

NANCY
I can just imagine

MICHAEL
He didnt want to tell on the kid
Like his friends would say he was a
snitch I mean lets face it
Penelope it wasnt only valor

PENELOPE
You might say that But valor itself
requires a social context

NANCY
Naturally So how did you I mean
how did you finally get Zacharys
name

PENELOPE
Well because we explained to Ethan
that protecting this child was not
going to help him

MICHAEL
We told him if this kid thinks he
can go on hitting people and getting
away with it why should he stop

PENELOPE
We told him that if we were that
childs parents we would absolutely
want to know about this

NANCY
Of course
Yeah

ALAN’s cell phone vibrates He quickly pulls it out of his
jacket pocket

ALAN (CONTD)
Excuse me one second

ALAN walks away from the others While he speaks he takes a
newspaper out of the pocket of his overcoat

ALAN (CONTD)
Yes Gary thanks for getting back to
me So its in this mornings
Journal Ill read it to you

British journal Lancet two
Australian researchers have
identified secondary neurological
effects of TW Pharmas anti-
hypertension medication Antril

now He got rid of the hamster last
night

NANCY
You got rid of the hamster

MICHAEL
Yeah Made such a racket at night
Those things sleep during the day
Ethan was going crazy He couldn’t
stand the racket that hamster made
Now I dont mind telling you I been
wanting to get rid of the thing for
the longest time So I thought
thats it I took it out and left it
in the street I figured it was a
gutter-sewer kind of animal but no
It was scared out of its wits out
there on that sidewalk Truth is
theyre not pets and theyre not
wild I dont know where they belong
Drop them in a clearing in the woods
theyre still not happy I mean where
are you supposed to put them

NANCY
You just left him outside

PENELOPE

He did and then he tried to convince
Courtney that the hamster ran away
Of course she wasnt buying it

ALAN
And this morning the hamster was
gone
MICHAEL
Gone
PENELOPE
And you What kind of work do you do
NANCY
Im an investment counselor
PENELOPE
Would it be possible -- and Ill just

come out and ask you directly --for
Zachary to apologize to Ethan

ALAN
It would be good if they talked

NANCY
Hes got to apologize Alan He has
to actually say hes sorry

ALAN
Yeah I mean sure probably

PENELOPE
Well is he sorry

ALAN
He knows what he did He didnt
realize how serious it was Hes
eleven years old

PENELOPE
Eleven is not a baby

MICHAEL
Its not an adult either We didnt
ask you you want some coffee or tea
Is there any cobbler left Penny She
makes a mean cobbler

ALAN
If you got espresso I dont mind a
cup

NANCY

A glass of water

MICHAEL
(to PENELOPE )
Espresso for me too babe And bring
the cobbler

PENELOPE leaves the room After a short beat

MICHAEL (CONTD)
You got to taste this cobbler
MICHAEL suddenly rises follows PENELOPE out

INT KITCHEN - DAY 4

In the LONGSTREET kitchen PENELOPE is busy at the espresso
machine MICHAEL enters

MICHAEL
Where’s the cobbler

They look around the room Then PENELOPE opens the
refrigerator and takes a cake dish out

PENELOPE
She put the cobbler in the fridge
again I don’t know what language I
should speak to her in

MICHAEL takes out some plates and spoons

MICHAEL
They’re nice right
PENELOPE
Do you need to tell everyone I’ma

writer
MICHAEL sets out a tray including the cobbler

MICHAEL
You are a writer You wrote a book

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 5

In the living room the COWAN’s have changed positions
NANCY is sitting in another seat as if she had gotten up to
look at something in the meantime ALAN is now seated as
well

NANCY
A very nice couple admit it

ALAN
Very

MICHAEL comes back with the tray

MICHAEL
A good cobbler isn’t easy to make

NANCY
True

MICHAEL sets the tray on the coffee table During the
following dialog he carves out portions on the plates and
hands them to his guests
ALAN
What do you sell

MICHAEL
Decorative hardware Door locks
handles copper fittings And kitchen
equipment pots and pans

ALAN
That a good living

MICHAEL
You know its not like we had any
banner years or anything It was
tough starting out But long as Im
out there every morning with my
catalog and my sample case its a
living Although the cast iron
roasting pans do pick up around the
holidays

ALAN
Yeah

NANCY
When you saw the hamster was
terrified why didnt you bring it
home

MICHAEL
Cause I dont touch them

NANCY
You put it on the sidewalk

PENELOPE returns with the coffee
MICHAEL

It was in the cage I flipped it
over No way Im touching those

creatures
PENELOPE
(to ALAN)
Sugar
ALAN

No no sugar What kind of cobbler
you make

PENELOPE
Apple and pear

NANCY
Apple and pear
PENELOPE
My own little recipe
(giggles )
Its too cold Shame

NANCY
Apple and pear thats new to me

PENELOPE
Apple and pear is a classic But
there is a trick to it

NANCY
Really

PENELOPE
You have to cut the pear thicker than
the apple because the pear cooks
faster

NANCY
Oh right

MICHAEL
Shes not telling you the real
secret

PENELOPE
Let them taste it

ALAN
Very good Very good

NANCY
Delicious

PENELOPE
Gingerbread crumbs

NANCY
Oh my God

PENELOPE

Its sort of a souped-up Marie
Callender recipe To be honest I got
the idea from his mother

ALAN
Gingerbread fantastic At least we
get a new recipe out of this

PENELOPE
I wish my son didnt have to lose two
teeth in the process

ALAN
Of course thats what I meant

NANCY
You have a novel way of expressing
it

ALAN
No hey I

His cell vibrates - he checks the display

ALAN (CONTD)
I have to take this Yes Gary

beat
No No letters to the editor Youll
just feed the flames
beat
Was it scheduled
beat
Uh-huh
beat

What disorders are you talking about

And in normal doses
beat
How long have you known this
beat
And in all that time you havent
recalled it

beat
What are we talking about in
revenues

beat
Oh Oh I see

beat

OK

ALAN hangs up and immediately dials another number all the
while gobbling down his cobbler

NANCY
Alan were all waiting for you

ALAN

years

they didnt schedule a reserve
nothing in the annual report

bea

ct

(MORE)

ALAN (CONTD)
Unsteady walk equilibrium problems
Basically you look like youre drunk
all the time

ALAN and his assistant have a laugh He stuffs himself with
cobbler laughing and talking with his mouth full
unabashed

ALAN (CONTD)

A hundred fifty million in revenues

(beat)
Deny everything

(beat)
That dumbshit wanted us to write a
letter to the editor No way were
writing a letter On the other hand
if we see this is getting picked up
we could do a press release
Somebodys spreading false rumors two
weeks out from the ASM kind of

thing
(beat)

Hes calling me back
(beat)

OK
(hangs up)

Ive been so busy I hardly had time
for lunch

MICHAEL
Help yourself help yourself

ALAN
Thanks I know Im pushing it Where
were we

PENELOPE
We were saying it would have been
better to meet some other way

ALAN
Oh right Yeah So this cobbler
your mother huh

MICHAEL
Its my mothers recipe but Pen made
it

PENELOPE
Your mothers doesnt mix pear and
apple

MICHAEL
No

PENELOPE

She has to have an operation poor
thing

NANCY
Yeah What for

PENELOPE
The knee

MICHAEL

Shes going to get a polyethylene and
metallic prosthesis Shes wondering
whats going to be left of it after
the cremation

PENELOPE
Dont be mean

MICHAEL
She doesnt want to be buried with my
father She wants to be cremated and
put upstate next to her mother whos
all alone A couple of urns jabbering
away on the shores of Lake Sebago
Ha ha

Everyone laughs politely Very discreetly ALAN edges toward
the exit

NANCY
Were very touched by how generous
youre being We realize how youre
trying to smooth things out here
instead of making them worse

PENELOPE

Please its the least we could do
MICHAEL

Yeah
NANCY

No come on So many parents just
take their kids side acting like
children themselves If Ethan had
broken two of Zacharys teeth Im
thinking Alan and I might have had
more of a knee-jerk reaction Im not
sure we would see the big picture

MICHAEL
Sure you would

ALAN
Shes right Im not so sure

MICHAEL
You would Because we all know it
could have happened the other way
around

Beat PENELOPE’s disapproval of her husband’s remark is
silent but clear

PENELOPE
So what does Zachary say How is he
experiencing this

NANCY
He doesnt talk much A little
overwhelmed I guess

PENELOPE
He realizes that he disfigured his
schoolmate

ALAN

No No he doesnt realize that he
disfigured his schoolmate

NANCY
Why do you say that Of course
Zachary realizes

ALAN
He realizes that this violent
behavior is unacceptable Not that he
disfigured his schoolmate

PENELOPE
You dont like the word but
unfortunately the word is
appropriate

ALAN
My son did not disfigure your son

PENELOPE
Your son disfigured our son Come
back after school hours look at his
mouth and teeth

MICHAEL
Momentarily disfigured

ALAN
His mouth will be fine when the
swelling goes down As for the teeth
if he needs it wed be willing to
chip in for the best dental care

MICHAEL
We got insurance for that What we
want is for the boys to patch it up
make sure nothing like this ever
happens again

NANCY
Lets set up a meeting

MICHAEL
Yeah Exactly

PENELOPE
With us there

ALAN

They dont need coaching Let them
work it out like men

NANCY
Like men Alan dont be ridiculous
On the other hand maybe we dont
need to be there Maybe its better
if we werent there right

PENELOPE
The issue is not whether we should be
there or not The issue is do they
want to talk do they want to clear

this up

MICHAEL
Ethan does

PENELOPE
But Zachary

NANCY

We won’t give him a choice

PENELOPE
It has to come from him

NANCY
Zachary acts like a thug were not
going to wait around for him to see
the light

PENELOPE
If Zachary sees Ethan in a punitive
context because hes forced to I
cant see anything positive coming
out of that

ALAN
Mrs Longstreet our son is a maniac
If you hope hell suddenly and
spontaneously get all apologetic
youre dreaming Look Im sorry but
I really do have to get back to the
office

ALAN forces the moment “Time to go”

NANCY rises as well Pretty soon everyone is standing

ALAN (CONTD)
Nancy you stay Youll let me know
what was decided Im no use to
anyone anyway Women think you need
the man you need the father like it
would do any good The man is just
baggage you drag around Hes out of
step and clumsy Oh you can see part
of the el from here cool

NANCY
Im really sorry but I cant stay
either My husband has never been
much of an I1ll-push-the-stroller
type daddy

Everyone drifts toward the door

PENELOPE
Pity Its wonderful walking with a
child It goes by so fast Michael
you really liked taking care of the
kids you had a ball pushing that
stroller

MICHAEL
Yeah sure

INT FOYER - DAY 6

Everyone is in the foyer PENELOPE hands NANCY her coat and
she puts it on ALAN has opened the door and is already at
the doorstep when PENELOPE speaks

PENELOPE
So what should we decide

NANCY
Could you come over to our place at
about seven-thirty with Ethan

PENELOPE
Seven-thirty What do you think
Michael
MICHAEL
Well if you want my opinion
NANCY
Yes please
MICHAEL

I think Zachary should be the one to
come over

PENELOPE
Yes I agree

MICHAEL
The victim shouldnt be the one who
makes the trip

PENELOPE
Thats right

ALAN already has one foot out on the landing

ALAN
I cant be anywhere at seven-thirty

NANCY
Who needs you Youre useless right

PENELOPE
Seriously I think its a good idea
for his father to be there

ALAN’s cell vibrates again

ALAN
(answering PENELOPE )
All right but not tonight
(on phone )
Hello

INT LANDING AND ELEVATOR - DAY

His cell phone stuck to his ear ALAN uses the moment
step out on the landing and ring for the elevator

ALAN
Not a word in the annual report But
the risk wasnt officially
established Theres no proof

He hangs up

NANCY is on the landing as well PENELOPE and MICHAEL

quickly amble down the hall toward the elevator
PENELOPE

Tomorrow

ALAN
Tomorrow Im in Washington

PENELOPE
You have business in Washington

ALAN
A client of mine we have an
appointment at the Pentagon

to

NANCY
The main thing is to get the kids to
talk Ill come over to your place
with Ethan at seven-thirty and well
let them talk it through What You
dont seem convinced

PENELOPE
If Zachary hasnt acquired
accountability skills theyll just
glare at each other it will be a
disaster

ALAN
Accountability skills Mrs
Longstreet What are you talking
about

PENELOPE
Im sure your son is not a maniac

NANCY
Zachary is not a maniac

ALAN
Yes he is

NANCY
Alan dont be an idiot Why are you
saying that

ALAN
Hes a maniac

MICHAEL
How does he explain what he did

NANCY
He wont talk about it

PENELOPE
He should talk about it

The elevator arrives ALAN holds the door open and puts one
foot inside as he speaks

ALAN
Mrs Longstreet thats a lot of
shoulds He should come here he
should talk about it he should feel
sorry Im sure youre much more
proficient than we are Were trying
to get up to speed but in the
meantime try to indulge us

MICHAEL
Hey come on What happened here This
isnt what were about

With friendly authority MICHAEL claps a hand on ALAN’s
shoulder and leads him back into the hallway The elevator
door closes

PENELOPE
Im talking about him About Zachary

ALAN
I got that yeah

NANCY
Alan

NANCY gives her husband a long look

In the secret language of couples the single name
pronounced and the reproving look get the best of ALAN

Everyone walks away from the elevator
MICHAEL
Want some more coffee

ALAN
Coffee all right

ALAN is resigned reluctantly retracing his steps

NANCY
Me too Coffee thank you

PENELOPE has made no signs of going for the coffee

MICHAEL
It’s OK Pen Ill get it

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY 8

PENELOPE NANCY and ALAN are standing in the living room
They are all very uncomfortable

Awkward silence

NANCY
I see youre an art enthusiast

NANCY leans over and delicately picks up a book featuring
the painter Bacon

NANCY (CONTD)
I love Bacon too

PENELOPE
Oh yes Bacon

NANCY
(leafing through the
book )
Cruelty and splendor
PENELOPE
Chaos Balance
NANCY
Yes
PENELOPE

Is Zachary interested in art

NANCY
Not as much as he should be Your
children are

PENELOPE
We try We try to make up for the
lack in the school curriculum

NANCY
Right

PENELOPE
We try to get them to read Take them
to concerts and galleries I admit we
believe that culture can be a
powerful force for peace

NANCY
Youre so right

MICHAEL comes back with the coffee

MICHAEL

(as he walks in)
Is cobbler cake or pie This is an
important question I was in the
kitchen thinking Why should Linzer
Tart be a pie Go ahead go ahead
dont leave that miserable little
piece

PENELOPE
Cobbler is a cake The batter isnt
flattened to a crust its mixed with
the fruit

Taking MICHAEL’s lead they sit down again clearly not for
long - NANCY hasn’t even taken her coat off

ALAN
Youre a gourmet chef

PENELOPE
I like cooking Its something you
have to do out of love or not at all
The way I see it if the batter isnt
flattened to a crust then its not
pie

MICHAEL
What about you You have other kids

ALAN
I have a son by a former marriage

MICHAEL
I was wondering I know its not
important but what were they arguing
about Ethan wont say a word on the
subject

NANCY
Ethan wouldnt let Zachary be part of
his gang

PENELOPE
Ethan has a gang

ALAN
And he called him a snitch

PENELOPE
(to MICHAEL )
Did you know that Ethan had a gang

MICHAEL
No But Im thrilled to hear it
PENELOPE
Why are you thrilled
MICHAEL
Cause I had one too I was the
leader
ALAN
So was I
PENELOPE

What does the leader of a gang do

MICHAEL
You got five six guys who like you
and theyre willing to sacrifice
themselves for you Like in Ivanhoe

ALAN
Like in Ivanhoe exactly
PENELOPE
Who even knows Ivanhoe nowadays

ALAN
So its another role model Like
Spiderman

PENELOPE

Well apparently you know more about
it than we do Zachary wasnt quite
as silent as you first said he was
And why did he call him a snitch
Forget it thats silly Thats a
silly question I mean I dont even
care thats not the point

NANCY
Were not going to get into these
childrens quarrels

PENELOPE
Its none of our business

NANCY
Right

PENELOPE

What is our business is this
unfortunate incident Violence is our
business

MICHAEL
When I was a leader in fifth grade
I beat Jimmy Leach in a fair fight
and he was stronger than me

PENELOPE
What does that mean Michael What
has that got to do with anything

MICHAEL
No nothing

PENELOPE
Were not talking about a fair fight
These children werent having a
fight

MICHAEL
Right right I was just remembering
something

ALAN
Its not very different

PENELOPE
Yes it is Excuse me but there is a
difference

MICHAEL
There is a difference

ALAN
What difference

MICHAEL
Jimmy Leach and me we agreed to
fight

ALAN
Did you mess him up

MICHAEL
A little sure

PENELOPE
All right enough about Jimmy Leach
Would you mind if I talked to
Zachary

NANCY
Of course not

PENELOPE
I wouldnt do it without your
permission

NANCY
Talk to him Thats completely fine
with us

ALAN
And good luck with that

NANCY
Stop it Alan I dont understand
you

ALAN
Mrs Longstreet is acting

PENELOPE
Penelope I think well do better if
were on a first name basis

ALAN
Penelope youre acting on a desire
to educate and I think thats just
great

PENELOPE
If you dont want me to talk to him
I wont

ALAN
Go ahead and talk to him lecture
him do whatever you want
PENELOPE
I dont understand how you feel so
uninvolved here

ALAN
Mrs

MICHAEL
Penelope

ALAN

Penelope I am very involved My son
injured another child

PENELOPE
Deliberately

ALAN
See thats the kind of thing that
irks me We know deliberately

PENELOPE
But thats what makes all the
difference

ALAN
The difference between what and what
Were only talking about one thing
here Our kid picked up a stick and
hit your kid Thats why were here
right

NANCY
Fruitless

MICHAEL
Right shes right This kind of talk
is fruitless

ALAN
Why do you feel you need to slip in
the word deliberately What kind of
lesson are you trying to teach me

NANCY
(suddenly rising )
All right this is getting silly My
husband is all stressed out over work
stuff Ill come back here tonight
with Zachary and well let them work
it out naturally

ALAN
I am not stressed out in the least

NANCY
Well I am

MICHAEL
Theres no reason to be stressed out

NANCY
Yes there is

ALAN’s cell vibrates

He rises and takes a step away trying to keep his
conversation separate

While he speaks on the phone the others try to continue

their own dialog

ALAN
Dont answer
(beat)
No comment
(beat)

No you cant recall it If you
recall it youre admitting
responsibility

(beat)
Recalling Antril would be admitting
your responsibility

PENELOPE
In the school play last Christmas
wasnt it Zachary who played

NANCY
Ebenezer Scrooge

ALAN
Theres nothing budgeted in the
annual report I mean if you want to
get accused of accounting
irregularities if you want them to
haul you out of the meeting in
handcuffs two weeks from now go
right ahead and recall it

PENELOPE
Ebenezer Scrooge right

In order to counter the nuisance of the other conversation

ALAN speaks louder and louder into his phone

ALAN
Talk about the victims after the
stockholders meeting Gary
(beat)
Well see where the stock is after
the meeting

PENELOPE raises her voice as well to compensate

PENELOPE
He was wonderful

NANCY sits down with some difficulty She doesn’t look well

NANCY
Yes

ALAN
We cant recall a drug because three
guys cant walk a straight line
(beat)
Dont answer at all right now
(beat)
Right call you right back

ALAN hangs up and immediately calls his assistant

PENELOPE
We remember him as Scrooge Right
Michael You remember

MICHAEL
Sure sure

ALAN
(to his assistant )
They’re in panic mode They have the
media breathing down their necks

PENELOPE
With that night bonnet He was very
funny
NANCY
Yes
ALAN
(screaming to be

heard )
I want a release that doesnt sound
defensive at all Just the opposite
Go for the jugular TW Pharma is a
target Attempt at manipulation of
the stock two weeks before the
stockholders meeting Where did this
study come from anyway How does this
suddenly drop out of a clear blue
sky etcetera Not one word about the
health issue Only one question Who
is behind the study Who

(beat)
Fine

A short silence

MICHAEL
Pharmaceutical companies are the
worst right Profit profit profit

ALAN is hardly listening and answers reflexively all the
while trying to dial another number

ALAN
Nobody said you should listen to my
conversation

MICHAEL
Nobody said you should have it under
my nose

ALAN

(still elsewhere )
Wrong I am totally forced to have it
here Against my will believe me

MICHAEL
They just peddle the shit No
conscience problems

ALAN has his cell to his ear He is speaking to MICHAEL but
obviously waiting for an answer on the phone which doesn’t
come

ALAN
In any therapeutic advance there are
benefits and there are risks

MICHAEL
Yeah sure I know Still I mean you
got some funny line of work

ALAN gives up on his call and comes over to stand in front
of MICHAEL

ALAN
What does that mean

PENELOPE
Michael its none of our business

MICHAEL
Funny line of work

ALAN
What about you what do you do

MICHAEL
I got a normal job

ALAN
Whats a normal job
MICHAEL
I told you I sell pots and pans

other stuff

ALAN
Oh flush mechanisms I like that

NANCY vomits violently A sudden catastrophic regurgitation
and part of it gets on ALAN

The art books on the coffee table are also splashed

MICHAEL (CONTD)

of-print for ages

ALAN (CONTD)
Her cobbler is horrible

food in me some time

After gargling NANCY sits back down on the edge of the tub
ALAN puts his shirt back on

NANCY
What the hell are we doing here

ALAN
(beat in utter
disbelief )
Youre kidding I hope

NANCY
Why do you argue with her We’d have
been out of here a long time ago if
you didn’t bicker over every word

husband

NANCY

You think it was the cobbler

ALAN

PENELOPE
You mitigate Youre trying to
reconcile everything

MICHAEL
I am not

PENELOPE
You are You had your gang and you
were the leader and they can do
whatever they want with their son
Their son is a threat to homeland
security When a kid is a menace to
society its everybodys business I
cant believe she barfed all over my
books

She sprays the Kokoschka
MICHAEL holds the Dolgans book so she can spray it too
PENELOPE (CONTD)

MICHAEL holds up the Foujita
PENELOPE (CONTD)

PENELOPE (CONTD)
Disgusting

MICHAEL

dryer

ALAN

ALAN
You wanted the blow dryer

PENELOPE
Thank you

MICHAEL
Thanks
(taking the blow-
dryer )
We call each other darjeeling like
the tea Ask me thats a lot more
embarrassing

MICHAEL plugs in the dryer and starts trying to dry the
books The blow dryer’s electric cord is relatively short -
he has to bring the books over to work on them

PENELOPE smooths the wet pages of the Kokoschka catalog

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Smooth it out smooth it out

As she smooths out the pages she raises her voice to be
heard over the dryer

PENELOPE
How is she Is she better The poor
thing

ALAN
Better

PENELOPE
I reacted badly Im ashamed of
myself

ALAN

No

PENELOPE
I rubbed it in about the catalog I
cant believe I did that

MICHAEL
Turn the page Pull it taut Nice
and taut

ALAN

Its going to tear

PENELOPE
Hes right Michael thats enough

attached to things you dont even
really know why

MICHAEL closes the catalog and the two of them pile some
heavy books on top of it

MICHAEL dries the Foujita the Dolgans etc

MICHAEL

back to the living room

PENELOPE
Oh Nancy I was getting worried All

ALAN
If youre not sure stay away from
the coffee table

NANCY

MICHAEL

well
PENELOPE

Nancy Im sorry I wasnt really
there for you I was so focused on my
Kokoschka

NANCY
Thats all right

PENELOPE
I reacted very poorly

NANCY
Please

Awkward silence

NANCY (CONTD)
In the bathroom I was thinking

PENELOPE
(as nicely as she
possibly can)

Yeah
NANCY
Maybe we glossed over the Well I
mean
MICHAEL
What is it Nancy What
NANCY
Name-calling is a kind of abuse
MICHAEL
Sure
PENELOPE

Depends Michael
MICHAEL
Right Depends

NANCY
Zachary has never been a violent
child He must have had his reasons

ALAN
Like getting called a snitch

His cell phone vibrates

ALAN (CONTD)
Excuse me

He walks away making apologetic gestures to NANCY

ALAN (CONT’D)
Yeah

(beat)
As long as there are no comments from
the victims No victims I dont want
you sitting down with victims

(beat)
Deny deny deny And if we have to
well sue the journal Well fax you
the draft of the press release Gary

(hangs up)
Call me a snitch it gets a rise out
of me
MICHAEL

Unless its true

ALAN
What

MICHAEL
I mean if the shoe fits

NANCY
My son is a snitch

MICHAEL
Come on I was joking around

NANCY
So is yours anyway

MICHAEL
What do you mean so is ours

NANCY
He fingered Zachary

MICHAEL
We coaxed it out of him

PENELOPE
Michael were completely off point
here

NANCY
Nevertheless Maybe you coaxed but
he did finger him

ALAN
Nancy

NANCY
Nancy what
(to MICHAEL )
You think my son is a snitch

MICHAEL
I dont think anything

NANCY
Well if you dont think anything then
dont say anything Dont make
insinuations

PENELOPE
Nancy lets not lose our cool here
Michael and I have gone out of our
way to be conciliating and fair-
minded

NANCY
Not so fair-minded

PENELOPE
Oh really Hows that

NANCY
Superficially fair-minded

ALAN
Doodle I really have to go

NANCY
So go Coward

ALAN
Nancy right now Im in danger of
losing my most important client So
this caring parents crap and the
bickering that goes along with it

PENELOPE
My son lost two teeth Two incisors

ALAN
Right yeah I think we got that

PENELOPE
One of them permanently

ALAN
Hell get new teeth theyll give him
new teeth Better teeth No one
chewed his ear off

NANCY
It was a mistake not to consider the
source of the problem

PENELOPE
There is no source Theres an eleven-
year-old kid who hits people With a
stick

ALAN
Armed with a stick

MICHAEL
We took that word out

ALAN
You took it out because we asked you
to

MICHAEL
We took it out with no argument

ALAN
A word which deliberately establishes
intent and excludes any hint of a
misunderstanding Which excludes
childhood

PENELOPE
Im not sure I can put up with that
tone of voice

ALAN
Were not quite on the same page you
and I Right from the start

PENELOPE
Mr Cowan there is nothing so
frustrating as being upbraided for
something we ourselves admitted was a
mistake The word armed wasnt
right we changed it Although
strictly defined it certainly
applies

NANCY
Zachary was verbally abused and he
reacted If Im attacked I defend
myself especially when Im all alone
against a whole gang
MICHAEL
Well youve certainly perked up
since you tossed your cookies

NANCY
Do you realize how crude that
expression is

MICHAEL
Were all people of good will All
four of us How do we get all carried
away losing our tempers Its
entirely unnecessary

PENELOPE
Oh Michael stop it Thats enough
mitigating Were only superficially
fair-minded so lets not be fair-
minded at all

MICHAEL
Oh no Im not going to be led down
that path

ALAN
What path

MICHAEL
The path those two little shit-for-
brains sent us down All right

ALAN
Im afraid Pen doesnt see things
that way

PENELOPE
Penelope

ALAN
Sorry

PENELOPE

So now poor Ethan is a shit-for-
brains That really takes the cake

ALAN
OK thats it I really have to leave
now

NANCY
So do I

PENELOPE

ALAN
If shes taking it and she looks
normal Ill take her deposition

MICHAEL

If my mother has the slightest
symptom my name will be at the top
of a class-action suit

ALAN
Well have one anyway

MICHAEL
I should hope so

NANCY
Goodbye Mrs Longstreet

PENELOPE
Doing the right thing is futile
Honesty is just stupidity All it
does is weaken you You let your
guard down

ALAN
OK lets go Nancy Thats enough
sermons and lectures for one day

ALAN picks up NANCY’s coat and hands it to her then leads
her toward the foyer Nancy puts her coat on as she crosses
the room

MICHAEL

(taking a step or two

after them )
Go ahead go But let me tell you one
thing Now that I know you I think
whats-his-name Zachary may have
some pretty extenuating
circumstances

NANCY stops and turns half-way toward MICHAEL

NANCY
When you killed that hamster
MICHAEL
Killed
NANCY
Killed
MICHAEL

I killed the hamster

NANCY
Yes You do everything you can to
make us feel guilty you stake out
the moral highground as your own but
you yourself are a murderer

MICHAEL
I definitely did not kill that
hamster

NANCY

Worse You left it out there
trembling with fear in a hostile
environment That poor critter was
probably eaten by a dog or a rat

PENELOPE
Shes right about that Shes right
about that

MICHAEL
What do you mean shes right

PENELOPE
She is I mean seriously Its
horrible what must have happened to
that animal

MICHAEL
I thought the hamster would be happy
to be free I was sure hed go
running around in the gutter happy
as a clam

PENELOPE
He didnt

NANCY
And you just left him there

MICHAEL
I cant touch those things I cant
touch anything of that family
Christ Penny you know that

PENELOPE
Hes afraid of rodents

MICHAEL
Yes I have a fear of rodents Im
terrified of reptiles Anything down
close to the ground no thanks
Thats all it is

ALAN
(to PENELOPE )
What about you How come you didnt
go downstairs and get it

PENELOPE
Hey I didnt even know Michael told
the kids and me the next morning
that the hamster ran away

(MORE)

PENELOPE (CONTD)
I went right out looking for it I
went right out I went all the way
around the block I even went down to
the cellar

MICHAEL
Penelope it is completely unfair
that all of a sudden Im in the hot
seat about this hamster thing that
you just had to tell them about
Thats a family issue that doesnt
concern anybody but us and its got
nothing to do with this situation
here And I cant believe Im getting
called a murderer In my own house

PENELOPE
What does your house have to do with
the price of tea in China

MICHAEL
Its my house and I open the doors
the doors are wide open in a spirit
of conciliation to people who should
be a little grateful

ALAN
Keep right on stroking your own ego
its beautiful

NANCY
You have no remorse

MICHAEL
I have no remorse That animal was
repulsive Im thrilled its gone

PENELOPE
Michael thats ridiculous

MICHAEL
Whats ridiculous What have you
lost your mind too now Their son
beats the shit out of Ethan and
youre in my face over a hamster

PENELOPE
What you did with that hamster was
wrong you cant deny that

MICHAEL
I dont give a fuck about that
hamster

PENELOPE

Youll have to give a fuck tonight
when your daughter gets home
MICHAEL
Bring her on Im not going to be
told how to act by a nine-year-old
snotnose brat

ALAN
Now I agree with him there a hundred
percent

PENELOPE
Thats pathetic

MICHAEL
Watch it Penelope watch it Ive
kept my shirt on up till now but
youre pushing me over a line

NANCY
And Ethan

MICHAEL
What about Ethan

NANCY
Is he sad too

MICHAEL
Ethans got other things on his
plate if you ask me

PENELOPE
Ethan wasnt so attached to Nibbles

MICHAEL
What kind of insipid name is that
anyway

NANCY
If you feel no remorse why should
our son

MICHAEL
You know what All this consultation
and consideration shit Im sick to
death of it We were nice to you We
bought tulips My wife dressed me up
as a liberal but the truth of the
matter is I got no sense of decorum
and Im a temperamental son of a
bitch to the core

ALAN
We all are

PENELOPE
No No Im sorry We are not all
temperamental sons of bitches

ALAN
Not you of course

PENELOPE
No not me Thank heavens

MICHAEL
Not you darjee not you Youre so
evolved You never go off half-
cocked

PENELOPE
Why are you being so aggressive with
me

MICHAEL
Im not being aggressive Just the
opposite

PENELOPE
Yes you are aggressive and you know
it

MICHAEL
You put this little bash together and
I let you recruit me

PENELOPE
You let me recruit you

MICHAEL
Yes

PENELOPE

That is so disgusting

MICHAEL
No its not Youre an advocate for
civilized behavior well thats fine
with me

PENELOPE

Im an advocate for civilized
behavior you bet I am And its a
good thing somebody is

(on the verge of

tears)
You think its better to be a son of
a bitch

ALAN
All right all right

PENELOPE
(still about to cry)
Thats OK to criticize someone for
not being a temperamental son of a
bitch

NANCY
Nobody said that Nobody criticized
you for that

PENELOPE
You did
(she cries)

ALAN
We did not

PENELOPE
What was I supposed to do Sue you
Never talk to you and tear you to
pieces through the insurance company

MICHAEL
Stop it Penny

PENELOPE
Stop what

MICHAEL
Youre blowing this all out of
proportion

PENELOPE
I dont care You do everything you
can to avoid the pettiness and you
wind up humiliated and completely
alone

ALAN’s cell vibrates again

ALAN
Yes
(beat)
Let them prove it
(beat)
Prove it
(beat)

From where I sit the best thing for
us to do is do nothing

MICHAEL
Were always alone Everywhere we go
Who wants a little Scotch

ALAN
Gary Im in a meeting right now
Ill call you when I get back to the
office

He hangs up
PENELOPE

Thats the thing I am living with a
totally negative person

ALAN
Whos negative

MICHAEL
Me

PENELOPE

This was the worst possible idea We
should never have had this meeting at

all
MICHAEL
I told you so
PENELOPE
You told me so
MICHAEL
Yeah
PENELOPE

You told me that you didnt want to
have this meeting

MICHAEL
I didnt think it was a very good
idea

MICHAEL crosses to the liquor cabinet pulls out a bottle
of scotch

NANCY
It was a good idea

MICHAEL
Oh come on
(holding up the
bottle )
Who wants some

PENELOPE
You told me it wasnt a good idea
Michael

MICHAEL
As I recall

PENELOPE
As you recall

ALAN
Maybe just a sip

NANCY
Dont you have to go

ALAN
At this point I might as well have a
little drink

MICHAEL pours two glasses of scotch and hands one to ALAN

PENELOPE
Look me in the eyes and tell me again
we didnt both agree to this

NANCY
Calm down Penelope calm down This
is going nowhere

PENELOPE
Who said not to touch the cobbler
this morning Who said we should keep
the rest for the Cowans Who said
that

ALAN
That was very nice of you

MICHAEL
Whats that got to do with it

PENELOPE
What do you mean what has it got to
do with it

MICHAEL
Guests are guests

PENELOPE
Youre lying youre lying He’s
lying

ALAN

You know my wife actually had to drag
me here today When you grow up with
a certain John Wayne idea of manhood
the impulse in this kind of situation
is not to talk it through

MICHAEL
Ha ha

NANCY
I thought the role model was Ivanhoe

ALAN
Same basic concept

MICHAEL
Another aspect
PENELOPE
Another aspect Just how much are you
going to humiliate yourself Michael

NANCY
I can see I dragged him here for
nothing

ALAN
What did you expect Doodle That is
a ridiculous nickname Some
revelation about universal values
This scotch is unbelievable

MICHAEL
Ah See that 18 years old single
malt from a tiny place in Scotland
where they still grow their own
barley

PENELOPE
And the tulips who went to get them
All I said was its a pity we dont
have tulips I never said anything
about going all the way up to
Sullivan at dawn

NANCY
Dont get all bent out of shape over
this Penelope it isnt worth it

PENELOPE
He got the tulips Him and only him
Dont we get a drink

NANCY
Penelope and I would like a drink
too Pretty funny when you think
about it a direct descendant of
Ivanhoe and John Wayne but hes
scared to pick up an itty-bitty
mouse

MICHAEL
Stop with the hamster Stop

MICHAEL serves NANCY some scotch

PENELOPE

Ha ha Youre right its laughable
NANCY

And her
MICHAEL

I dont think that will be necessary

PENELOPE
Pour me a drink Michael

MICHAEL
No

PENELOPE
Michael

MICHAEL
No

PENELOPE tries to tear the bottle away from him
MICHAEL wont let her

NANCY
What is wrong with you Michael

MICHAEL hands PENELOPE the bottle
MICHAEL

Fine go ahead Drink drink what
does it matter

NANCY
Is drinking bad for you or
something

PENELOPE
Its great for me What could be bad
anyway

She pours herself a drink takes a sip breaks down crying

ALAN
Well Now I dont know

PENELOPE
(to ALAN)
Mr uh

NANCY
Alan

PENELOPE
Alan you and I didnt exactly hit it
off but you see I live with a man
who has decided once and for all that
life is synonymous with mediocrity
Its very hard to live with a man
whos walled himself up in that
notion who doesnt want to change
anything who never gets excited
about anything
MICHAEL
What does he care He couldnt care
less

PENELOPE
One needs to believe To believe in
some possible correction right

MICHAEL
Hes the last guy on earth you should
be telling all this to

PENELOPE
Ill talk to anyone I damn well
please

The LONGSTREET family phone rings

MICHAEL
Who the fuck is that now

ID and picking up)

PENELOPE
No

NANCY
Then why do you worry your mother

PENELOPE
He cant help himself He always has
to worry her

MICHAEL
OK thats enough Penelope What is
this drama queen bullshit

ALAN
Penelope who really cares about
anything outside himself Sure wed
all like to believe in some kind of
possible correction one we could
author ourselves completely free of
selfish consideration But is that
really even possible Some people
drag their feet through life thats
just how they are

(MORE)

ALAN (CONTD)
And some cant stand still while the
sands of time run out We all keep
fussing and fidgeting till we drop
dead Education global strife
Like youre writing this book about
Darfur and thats great I
understand how you might say OK
Ill pick a massacre history is full
of them and Im going to write about
it Everybody has to save himself
somehow

PENELOPE
Im not writing this book to save
myself You havent read it you
dont know whats in it

ALAN
Whatever
PENELOPE
That odor of Kouros is killing me
MICHAEL
Its an abomination
ALAN
You didnt exactly skimp
NANCY
Im sorry
PENELOPE

Its not your fault Im the one who
sprayed like a madwoman And why
cant we just take it easy once in a
while Why does everything always
have to be so exhausting

ALAN
You think too much Women think too
much

NANCY
(sarcastic )
Theres an original response
(to Penelope )
Which must be pleasantly
disconcerting to you

PENELOPE
I dont know what that means to
think too much And I dont
understand how you can go on living
without some moral sense of the
world

MICHAEL
Look at me Im living

PENELOPE
Shut up Shut up I detest that
wretched complicity of yours You
disgust me

MICHAEL
Wheres your sense of humor

PENELOPE
I have no sense of humor And I dont
want one

MICHAEL
If you ask me the couple is the most
terrible ordeal God ever inflicted on
us

NANCY
Marvelous

MICHAEL
The couple and the family

NANCY
No ones forcing you to air this out
in front of us Michael And I might
add its a little indecent

PENELOPE
That doesnt bother him

MICHAEL
Dont you agree

NANCY
This is all off point Alan say
something

ALAN
He has a right to his ideas

NANCY
That doesnt mean he has to advertise
them

ALAN
Yeah all right maybe

NANCY
We dont care about their marriage
Were here about a problem with the
kids We dont care about their
marriage

ALAN
Yeah except

NANCY
Except what What are you saying

ALAN

MICHAEL
Its related Of course its related

PENELOPE
Ethans getting two of his teeth
broken is related to our marriage

MICHAEL
Of course it is

NANCY
We dont follow you

MICHAEL
Turn this thing around and take stock
of the situation were in Children
soak up our lives then they blow
them apart Children lead us to
disaster its like a law of nature
You see these young couples laughing
all the way to the altar and you
think they dont know Poor bastards
dont know a thing Theyre happy
Nobody briefs you in the beginning
This army buddy of mine is going to
have a kid with his new girlfriend I
say to him a kid at our age what
are you stupid You got ten fifteen
good years left before you get cancer
or have a stroke and youre going to
saddle yourself with a fucking kid

NANCY

Thats not really what you think
PENELOPE

Yes it is
MICHAEL

Of course its what I think I think
even worse

PENELOPE
Yes

NANCY
Youre debasing yourself Michael

MICHAEL
Is that right Ha ha

NANCY
Stop crying Penelope It only makes
it worse

ALAN fills his empty glass MICHAEL is thrilled

MICHAEL
Go ahead go ahead Excellent isnt
it

ALAN
Excellent

MICHAEL

Could I interest you in a cigar

PENELOPE
No No cigars here

ALAN
Too bad

NANCY
Were you going to smoke a cigar now
Alan

ALAN

I do what I want Nancy If I want to
smoke a cigar I smoke a cigar I
wont smoke it because I dont want
to upset Penelope whos already on
edge to put it mildly

(to PENELOPE )
Shes right quit snuffling like
that When women cry men are pushed
to a breaking point Although
unfortunately I must say that
Michaels point of view is completely
justified

The cell phone vibrates

ALAN (CONTD)
Yes Dennis

day

ALAN moves away a little and keeps his voice down

hot off the press

PENELOPE
Thats different Your son brutalized
our son

ALAN
Theyre young theyre just kids
Kids roughhouse in the playground

of nature

PENELOPE
No No it isnt

ALAN
Sure it is It takes a little
education to substitute the rule of
law for violence The origin of law
you might recall is brute force

PENELOPE
Maybe for prehistoric man it was Not
in this world

ALAN
In this world Tell me about this
world

PENELOPE
Youre tiresome This whole
conversation is tiresome

ALAN
Penelope I believe in the god of
carnage The god whose rule has been
unchallenged since time immemorial
Youre interested in Africa right

NANCY is retching

ALAN (CONTD)
Whats the matter

NANCY
Dont worry about me

ALAN
Nancy

NANCY
Im just fine

ALAN

See I just got back from the Congo
They got kids there trained to kill
at the age of eight In the course of
their childhood they might kill
hundreds of people Theyll kill with
a machete a shotgun a Kalash a
thump gun So obviously when my son
busts some other kids tooth even
two teeth with a bamboo switch at
the Third Street Playground Im not
quite as shocked and indignant as you
are

PENELOPE
Well you should be

NANCY
(exaggerating the
military sound of the
jargon )
Thump gun

ALAN
Yes thats what they call a grenade
launcher

NANCY spits into the pail

MICHAEL
You all right

NANCY
Im just fine

ALAN
What the hell is wrong with you
Whats wrong with her

NANCY
Its bile Its nothing

PENELOPE
Dont tell me about Africa I know
all about suffering in Africa

ALAN
I dont doubt it

PENELOPE
That’s all I’ve been thinking about
for months

MICHAEL
Dont get her started with this
Please

PENELOPE charges her husband and strikes him several times
wild with despair and irrational abandon

ALAN pulls her off

ALAN
You know Im actually starting to
like you

PENELOPE
Well Im not

MICHAEL

Talk about commitment to world peace
and stability

PENELOPE
Shut the fuck up

NANCY wretches again
She takes her glass of scotch and brings it to her lips

MICHAEL
You sure about that

NANCY
Very sure This will do me some good

PENELOPE

We live in New York City We dont
live in Kinshasa We live in New
York with the customs of western
society What happens in the Third
Street Playground is about western
values To which like it or not I
happen to subscribe

MICHAEL
Beating your husband must be one of
those customs then

PENELOPE
Michael I am warning you

ALAN
She was all over you like a bad rash
If I were you it would melt my heart

PENELOPE
I might finish the job in a second
NANCY
Hes making fun of you do you
believe it

PENELOPE
I couldnt care less

ALAN
No really Morally were supposed
to overcome our impulses but there
are times you dont want to overcome
them I mean who wants to say a Hail
Mary while youre having sex Can
you buy this scotch around here

MICHAEL
This one not very likely
NANCY
Thump gun Ha ha
PENELOPE
Thump gun really
ALAN
Yes Thump gun
NANCY

Why dont you just say grenade
launcher

ALAN
Because thats the term Just like
they say kalash and not Kalashnikov
or AK-47

NANCY
Who is they

ALAN
Thats enough Nancy Thats enough

NANCY
Hotshot firebrands like my husband
you got to understand its hard for
them to get excited about what
happens down the block

ALAN
Exactly

PENELOPE
I dont see why I dont see why
Were all citizens of the world I
dont see why we shouldnt also be
involved on a local community basis

MICHAEL
Oh Penny Give us a break with the
highfalutin clap trap

PENELOPE
Im going to kill him

The cell vibrates

ALAN
Yes yes take out barefaced
(beat)
Brazen A brazen attempt to
(beat)
There you go

PENELOPE
Shes right its unbearable after a
while

ALAN
But he signed off on the rest
(beat)
Good good Thats fine
(hangs up)
What were we talking about Thump
guns

PENELOPE
I was saying that whatever my
husband thinks exercising vigilance
is not limited to one particular
place

ALAN
Exercising vigilance Yeah
Nancy its absurd to drink in your
condition

NANCY
What condition I’m perfect

ALAN
Its an interesting idea
(picks up cell)
Yes
(beat)
No no interviews before we get the
release out

PENELOPE
Mr Cowan would you please put an
end to this nerve-racking
conversation

ALAN
(on phone )
No way
(MORE )

ALAN (CONTD)
(beat)
The stockholders wont give a shit
(beat)
Just remind him the stockholders
have the last word

NANCY walks to ALAN tears his cell phone away and after
briefly looking around for where to put it dunks it in the
tulip vase

ALAN (CONTD)
Nancy what are you

NANCY
There

PENELOPE
Ha ha Way to go

MICHAEL
(horrified )
Oh my god

ALAN
Are you out of your fucking mind
Shit

He rushes to the vase MICHAEL who has gotten there first
fishes the phone out Its soaking wet

MICHAEL
The blow-dryer Wheres the blow-
dryer

He finds it and plugs it back into the socket He
immediately turns it on and points it at the cell phone

Because of the short wire he has to stay close to the wall

ALAN
You should be put in a home dear I
cant believe this I got everything
in there Its brand new I spent
hours setting it up

MICHAEL speaks to NANCY over the loud noise of the blow
dryer

MICHAEL
I really dont understand you That
was an irresponsible thing to do

ALAN
I got everything my whole life was
in there

NANCY
His whole life

She downs her glass of scotch The noise continues

MICHAEL
Hang on maybe well get it running
again

ALAN

No way Its history

MICHAEL
I want to take out the battery and
the SIM card How do you open it

ALAN tries but he has no idea

ALAN

I just got it I don’t know
MICHAEL

Let me see
ALAN

Its history And they think its
funny they think its funny

MICHAEL puts the blow dryer down without turning it off

He hunkers down by the wall and easily opens the cell phone
Then he lays out the various elements on the floor ina
line

MICHAEL
There

He picks up the blow dryer and goes back to work PENELOPE
laughs heartily

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Penelope you could at least have the
good taste not to find this funny

PENELOPE
My husband has spent his whole
afternoon drying things

NANCY
Ha ha ha

NANCY goes right ahead and pours herself another glass of
scotch

MICHAEL who doesnt see any humor in it is working very
dilligently ALAN has slid down on to the ground next to
him back to the wall

The cell phone parts - battery SIM card cover etc all
tremble in the warm breeze from the blow dryer

The lighter pieces even move slightly

MICHAEL puts them back in order

For a moment the only sound is that of the blow-dryer
ALAN is completely demoralized

They look like a couple of sad-eyed children only one of
whom is still trying to have fun

ALAN
Forget it man Forget it Nothing
can be done

MICHAEL finally turns off the blow-dryer

MICHAEL
Got to wait
(after an awkward
silence )
You want to use the phone

ALAN shakes his head no shrugs to say he doesnt care

MICHAEL (CONTD)
I must say

NANCY
What must you say Michael

MICHAEL
No I dont even know what to say

NANCY
Id say it feels better It feels
better like this

(beat)

Id say its more peaceful wouldn’t
you Men get so attached to their
toys It diminishes them They lose
their credibility A man should have
both hands free In my opinion
Even briefcases I liked this guy
once and then I saw him carrying this
rectangular bag with a shoulder
strap A mans bag but with a
shoulder strap It was over A bag
with a shoulder strap thats the
worst But the cell phone always at
his fingertips is the worst too A
man should seem alone In my opinion
Seem like he can go it alone Ive
got a John Wayne idea of manhood
too What was it he had A Colt 45
Something that empties a room

(MORE)

NANCY (CONTD)

Any man that doesnt give off those
loner vibes just doesnt come off as
having any substance So Michael I
guess youre happy now Our little -
what was the word you used I forgot -
its coming apart at the seams But
hey you know what It sort of almost
feels good In my opinion

MICHAEL
I should warn you though Liquor can
drive a person insane

NANCY
Im as normal as can be
MICHAEL
Yeah right
NANCY

Im beginning to see things with a
pleasant serenity

PENELOPE
Ha ha Thats so good A pleasant
serenity

MICHAEL

As for you darjeeling I cant
understand why youre wasting
yourself right out in the open

PENELOPE
Shut the hell up

MICHAEL gets up and takes a box of cigars from a corner
cabinet He comes back and holds it out to ALAN

MICHAEL
Take one Alan Relax

PENELOPE
No cigar smoke in the house

MICHAEL
Hoyo de Monterrey or Partagas D
number 4 You got your Hoyo
Coronation or Epicure number 2

PENELOPE
You cant smoke in a house with an
asthmatic child

NANCY
Who has asthma

PENELOPE
Our son

MICHAEL
We had a god damn hamster didnt we

NANCY
Its true that pets arent good when
youre asthmatic

MICHAEL
Not good at all

NANCY
Even goldfish arent necessarily
recommended

PENELOPE
Do I have to listen to this drivel

PENELOPE tears the cigar box away from MICHAEL and slams it
shut

PENELOPE (CONTD)
Im sorry I guess Im the only one
who doesnt see things with pleasant
serenity To tell you the truth Ive
never been so unhappy I think this
is the unhappiest day of my whole
life

MICHAEL
Youre an unhappy drunk

PENELOPE
Michael every word out of your mouth
just slays me I dont get drunk I
had a sip of your shitty eighteen-
year old single malt that you
bring out like its the eighth wonder
of the world I dont get drunk and
believe me I wish I could It would
be such a relief to drown every
little sorrow in a good stiff drink

NANCY
My husband is unhappy too Look at
him All hunched over Like he was
left on the side of the road I think
its the unhappiest day of his life
too

ALAN
It is

NANCY
Im sorry Doodle

MICHAEL hits the cell phone parts with the blow-dryer again
PENELOPE
Turn that blow-dryer off His thing
is a goner

The COWAN family phone rings MICHAEL picks up

MICHAEL
Yeah
(beat)
Mom I told you were busy here
(beat)

Because its medication that can kill
you Its poison

(beat)
Here theres someone here who can
explain

He hands the phone to ALAN

MICHAEL (CONTD)

ALAN

MICHAEL

ALAN

NANCY

ALAN

She keeps calling me doctor

NANCY
Doctor what a laugh Hang up

ALAN
But youre I mean you dont have
any equilibrium issues

(beat)
No of course not Not at all
(MORE)

ALAN (CONTD)
Dont listen to what people say
Still and all its probably a good
idea for you not to take it anymore

for a while Just until Until this
operation is behind you

(beat)
Yes sounds like youre in excellent
health

MICHAEL tears the phone away

MICHAEL

All right Ma You got it Stop
taking that medication why you got

PENELOPE

bucket

MICHAEL takes the bottle of scotch and puts it out of
NANCY’s reach

MICHAEL
Thats enough

NANCY
Id say both sides share the blame
So there you are Both sides share

the blame

PENELOPE
What youre serious

NANCY
Excuse me

PENELOPE

Is that what you really think

NANCY
Its what I think yes

PENELOPE
Our son Ethan who took two codeine
Tylenols last night at three in the
morning shares the blame

NANCY

Hes not necessarily innocent
PENELOPE

Get the fuck out Get out of my

house
She grabs NANCYs handbag and throws it against the door
All the contents spill out

PENELOPE (CONTD)
Get the fuck out

NANCY
My bag
(like a little girl)
Alan
MICHAEL

What is going on here Theyve
totally lost it

NANCY picks up the items that have fallen from her bag

NANCY
Alan do something

PENELOPE
Alan do something

NANCY
Shut your mouth She broke my make-up
mirror And my perfume
(to ALAN )
Stand up for me Why dont you stand
up for me

ALAN
Lets go

He starts picking up the pieces of his cell phone

PENELOPE
Its not like Im strangling her

NANCY
What did I do to you

PENELOPE
The blame is not shared The victim
and the criminal are not the same

NANCY
The criminal

MICHAEL
Oh give it a fucking rest Penelope
Enough of this simplistic prattle

PENELOPE
Which I believe in

MICHAEL
Yeah you believe you believe This
crush you got on these Sudan niggers
is spilling over into everything now

PENELOPE
I am horrified How can you be so
openly despicable

MICHAEL
Because I feel like it I feel like
being openly despicable

PENELOPE
One day youll understand the sheer
horror of whats happening in that
part of the world and youll be
ashamed of your inability to take
action of your contemptibly
nihilistic attitude

MICHAEL
Yes darjeeling youre so wonderful
You are the best and the brightest
among us

PENELOPE
Yes Yes

NANCY
Lets get out of here Alan These
people are monsters

NANCY drinks down the rest of her scotch and goes for the
bottle ALAN stops her

ALAN
Stop it Nancy

NANCY
No I want to drink some more I want
to get drunk off my ass This bitch
throws my bag against a wall and
nobody lifts a finger I want to be
blind drunk

ALAN
Youre drunk enough

NANCY

How can you let her call our son a
criminal We come to their house to
work things out with them and they
insult us browbeat us they lecture
us about being good citizens of the
planet Im glad our son kicked the
shit out of your son and I wipe my
ass with your human rights

MICHAEL
A little booze and wow We see her
true self What happened to that
gracious demure woman with the soft
eyes

PENELOPE
I told you I told you

ALAN
What did you tell him

PENELOPE
That she was fake This woman is
totally fake Im sorry

NANCY
(in distress)
Ha ha ha

ALAN
When exactly did you say that

PENELOPE
When you were in the bathroom

ALAN
You had known her fifteen minutes and
you already knew she was fake

PENELOPE
I pick up on these things in people
very quickly

MICHAEL
She does

PENELOPE
I just have a nose for it

ALAN
Fake what does that mean

NANCY
I dont want to listen to this Why

ALAN

PENELOPE

all her manners she doesnt care any
more than you do
MICHAEL

ALAN

PENELOPE
Its true Youre saying its true

MICHAEL
They dont give a shit Its so
obvious right from the beginning

give a shit either youre right

ALAN
Like you do
(to NANCY )
Let him talk honey Explain to me
Michael exactly how you care What
does that mean anyway Youre more
credible when youre being openly
despicable Truth is nobody here
cares Except Penelope one must
acknowledge her integrity

PENELOPE
I dont need your acknowledgment I
dont need your acknowledgment

NANCY
But I do care I really do care

ALAN

We care in a hysterical way Nancy
Not like heroic figures of a social
movement

(to PENELOPE )
I saw your friend Jane Fonda on TV
the other day Made me want to run
out and buy a Ku Klux Klan poster

PENELOPE
My friend Jane Fonda What the hell
does she have to do with this

ALAN
Youre the same breed Youre the

same kind of involved problem-solver

woman
(MORE)

ALAN (CONTD)
Those are not the women we like the
women we like are sensual crazy
shot full of hormones The ones who
want to show off how perceptive they
are the gatekeepers of the world
theyre a big turnoff Even poor
Michael your own husband is turned
off

MICHAEL
Dont you speak for me

PENELOPE
We dont give a shit about what you
like in a woman Where do you get off
spouting these opinions Youre one
man whose opinion we dont give a
shit about

ALAN
Shes screaming A quartermaster on a
slave ship

PENELOPE
What about her She doesnt scream
She didnt just scream that your
little asshole was right to beat up
ours

NANCY
He was right At least our kid isnt
a little wimpy-ass faggot

PENELOPE
Yours is a snitch thats supposed to
be better

NANCY
(picking up her
coat )
Lets go Alan Why are we still in
this house

She starts toward the door but then crosses back to the
tulips and whacks them with her handbag

The flowers go flying all over the place in pieces

NANCY (CONTD)
Here Here This is what I think of
your stupid flowers your hideous
tulips Ha ha ha

She breaks down crying
NANCY (CONTD)

This is the worst day of my life
too

Silence
A long moment of stupor

ALAN leans over and starts picking up the stems and the
petals

MICHAEL picks up a glasses case fallen out of the bag and
hands it to NANCY without a word

EXT PARK AND PLAYGROUND - DAY 22
At the foot of an oak tree CLOSE on a hamster

He is shaking himself out on the ground where leaves and
roots from the tree are all tangled together The very happy

hamster nibbles on an acorn

WE MOVE UP revealing the same playground as the opening
scene of the film

In the distance the same group of children who had been in
the fight

They are all playing together happily
