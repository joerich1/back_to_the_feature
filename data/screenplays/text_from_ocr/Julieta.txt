Pedro Almod6var
Julieta’s three houses in Madrid at the’ three
different stages in the story

House 1 is the one she shares with her daughter Antia
after Xoan’s death 19 Fernando VI Third Floor From
1998 to 2006-2007

House 2 is the one to which she moves after throwing
out all the reminders of her daughter A neutral ugly
neighborhood far from the center Shortly after Ava
dies and Lorenzo appears in her life 2006-2007 to

House 3 is in the same building as House 1 19
Fernando VI Second Floor Julieta moves there
immediately after her encounter with Beatriz At that
moment she decides to stay in Madrid and not go to
Portugal with Lorenzo From 2016 to the end

1 MADRID JULIETA’S HOUSE 2 INT IN THE MORNING
2016 SPRING

A red fabric fills the screen Over it appear the
opening credits At first it gives a sensation of
stillness but with the insistence of the shot we
discover that the fabric is moving a slight rhythmic
movement We discover that the fabric is the front of a
dress and that Julieta’s heart is beating inside it

Julieta an attractive woman of 55 independent and
full of determination a mixture of timidity and
daring fragility and courage Blond She is sitting
next to a bookcase surrounded by cardboard boxes the
kind used for moving house She picks up a sculpture of
naked seated man with the color and texture of
terracotta (some 8 inches high) and wraps it carefully
in bubble wrap She places it in one of the cardboard
boxes that contains art books a framed photo with
Lorenzo a book of photos by Nan Goldin items that she
doesn’t want to get rid of

n front of the shelves on which books are piled up in
various groups Julieta tries to decide which she’1ll
put into boxes and which she’ll leave A great number
of the books have to do with Classical Greece
Mythology Art etc Juliet also puts in the box a
novel by Lorenzo Gentile “Adidés Volcan” on the cover
of which there is a sculpture by Ava as we will
discover in due time also a naked seated man
The walls of the apartment are painted white A sober
space with little furniture Bright and comfortable
Few decorative elements and the few that we see have to
do with Lorenzo In one corner there is a large writing
desk and hanging in the angle formed by the wall
there are three posters The rest of the walls are
bare A self-portrait of Lucien Freud announces a
portrait exhibition in London another poster by the
hyper-realist painter Antonio Lépez shows the deserted
Gran Via in Madrid The third poster is for the
spectacle “The Old Woman” by Bob Wilson The three hang
in their frames on the walls

Julieta goes over to the writing desk and opens a side
drawer She rummages in the bottom of the drawer until
she finds a blue envelope the size of a Christmas
card the texture of which shows that it has been kept
for several years an old envelope She takes the
envelope out of the drawer and looks at it The intense
blue of the envelope contrasts with the red of the
dress she is wearing Juliet holds it up for a moment
she doubts about putting it in the removals’ box
Finally she decides to throw it in the wastepaper
basket The wastepaper basket already contains a jumble
of papers and cuttings the result of the clean-out she
is doing

The entry phone rings Julieta goes into the kitchen
answers and then opens the door out to the landing She
goes back to the far end of the sitting room next to
the bookcase and continues choosing books to pack

2 MADRID JULIETA’S HOUSE 2 INT IN THE MORNING
2016 SPRING

Lorenzo Gentile in person comes into the apartment
Julieta had previously left the door open He is aged
between 55 and 60 an attractive man warm-hearted and
sincere A mature comfortable seducer Argentinean
with a soft accent he enjoys and is touched by the
sight of Julieta confused by the preparations for the
journey With a few books in her hand

JULIETA
I’m in a real mess I don’t know

which books to take

LORENZO
Take the essential ones If you
miss any you can buy them on the
Internet

JULIETA
I don’t like buying books I
already have It makes me feel
old

LORENZO
(Smiling) Right now you look like
a little girl

Julieta makes a nervous face

Lorenzo embraces her tenderly

arms

LORENZO
Apart from the books do you have
a lot to do

JULIETA
I still have to do some shopping

LORENZO
Julieta we’re not going to the
desert You’ll be able to come to
Madrid when you like or go to
Braga which is closer

JULIETA
(Suddenly serious) I’d like not
to come back to Madrid if I can
avoid it

They kiss

LORENZO
(Murmuring to her) Thank you

JULIETA
For what

LORENZO
For not letting me grow old on my
own

JULIETA
You’re the one not leaving me on my
own

3 MADRID A STREET JUNCTION IN THE CENTER

Julieta relaxes in

EXT DAY

his
2016 SPRING

Julieta is walking along laden with two plastic bags
They could be from a hardware store where she has
bought some gardening tools

Where the sidewalk goes round the corner she passes a
woman in her early thirties The woman is with a group
but Julieta notices only her face Neither of them
stops but both seem to be saying to themselves “I know
her”

They turn to each other and exclaim in unison

BEATRIZ
Julieta

JULIETA
Bea

Bea breaks away from her group even though she’s ina
hurry One woman in the group looks annoyed by the
meeting between Julieta and Beatriz

From their tone it’s obvious that they haven’t seen
each other in many years and that they were good
friends in another time They are very excited about
the encounter

Bea is very well dressed an outfit from the latest
collection by Dior and also a bag by Dior She doesn’t
seem like a fashion victim rather someone used to
dressing and accessorizing with the latest trends

After the usual gestures and words

BEATRIZ

I can’t believe this Juliet Just
last week I met your daughter at
Lake Como

Julieta’s eyes open wide Surprised she conceals the
impact of this news she holds her breath

JULIETA
You met Antia

BEATRIZ
Yes Just imagine We were looking
at each other and it was I who
went up to her because she didn’t
recognize me

Julieta has to make a great effort to be able to speak

BEATRIZ
But you look exactly the same
Julieta In fact better

Julieta manages to murmur “Thank you”

JULIETA
And what did she say

BEATRIZ
That (She hesitates looking
carefully for the best way to put
it) she had come down to the city
to buy things for her children
She’s got three Two boys and a
girl

Julieta gives a forced smile as if this information
weren’t a surprise for her But the truth is she’s
shocked More than that

JULIETA
Yes I don’t know how she manages
Do you have children

BEATRIZ
No I’m not even married

The woman in the group who is watching this meeting
with annoyance is showing signs of unease Beatriz can
feel her eyes boring into her shoulders The woman is
dressed with elegant masculine sobriety slim as an
ex-model who still maintains her aura

Although Julieta and Beatriz are happy to see each
other the conversation is a bit tense Julieta is
forcing her to linger and Bea is showing signs of
impatience Also the masculine woman doesn’t take her
eyes off her

BEATRIZ
It’s such a pity I’m in a
terrible hurry (Sincere) You

don’t know how delighted I am to
see you looking so well
The way in which she says this suggests that at some
point in their lives she had seen her looking very

unwell

JULIETA
Where are you living

BEATRIZ
In New York and Milan I’m
accessories editor for Vogue I
travel a lot I went to Lake Como
for a photo shoot Well

Julieta tries to hold her back a little longer

JULIETA
That’s wonderful Listen say
hello to your mother

BEATRIZ
Mom died three years ago My
brother lives here We’re meeting
him and my nieces in a restaurant
but we’re running late

Julieta looks anxiously at the woman in
is watching them in annoyance

JULIETA
I’m sorry (Forced but she wants
to know) What else did Antia tell
you

BEATRIZ

Not much I asked about you and
she told me you were still living
in Madrid And look what a
coincidence

JULIETA
Yes I’m still here And I’1l be
staying here And Did she look
well

BEATRIZ
Yes and she wasn’t even wearing
make-up She’s very thin but
pretty

She gives her a kiss obviously
conversation In a serious sincere tone

the group who

the
BEATRIZ
I’m really happy to see you
looking so well Julieta Bye

Beatriz runs off after the kiss and joins the group
waiting for her while Julieta watches hungrily

4 MADRID A STREET JUNCTION IN THE CENTER EXT DAY
CONT

2016 SPRING

Julieta remains motionless on the sidewalk She watches
helplessly as Beatriz disappears round the next corner
with her group of friends She would swear that the
woman dressed with masculine elegance is asking her
intrigued who she was Beatriz explains to her Juliet
can’t hear them

5 MADRID HOUSE 2 SITTING ROOM INT NIGHT
2016 SPRING

Julieta comes into her apartment with the plastic bags
containing her last purchases Her face is no longer
that of the happy tranquil woman in the first
sequences with Lorenzo Now her expression is somber
and agitated In her mind she hears time and again the
conversation with Beatriz in the street like a
ritornello She can’t get it out of her head

She leaves the bags on the writing desk picks up the
wastepaper basket and puts it on the desk Julieta
rummages around in it under the gaze of Lucian Freud
from one of the posters In the silence of the night
and with the light from the lamp Freud’s portrait
takes on an inquisitive presence Julieta finally finds
the Christmas card-sized blue envelope that she threw
out in the morning Her cell phone rings It’s Lorenzo
She doesn’t answer it It rings again she still
doesn’t answer it Julieta can’t stop looking at the
blue envelope while her breathing grows more agitated

6 MADRID JULIETA’S HOUSE 2 INT THE NEXT MORNING
2016 SPRING
Julieta puts some water in a saucepan to boil to make

tea Everything is tidy She is wearing sports clothes
suitable for house wear
Silence

The entry phone rings It’s Lorenzo Julieta presses
the button to let him in

Lorenzo raps on the door Julieta opens the apartment
door more rigid than usual and looking as if she’s had
a bad night Lorenzo comes into the hall From the
outset he notices that something is amiss He just has
to look at Julieta They greet each other with a
routine kiss on the mouth

LORENZO
Are you all right

As an answer

JULIETA
I’m boiling some water

She goes off to the kitchen followed by Lorenzo

LORENZO
I called you last night and you
didn’t answer

JULIETA
I needed to be alone

Lorenzo looks around as far as he can see Everything
is tidy there is no sign of suitcases or cardboard
boxes

LORENZO
What about the cases and the
boxes Don’t tell me you still
haven’t finished

JULIETA
I’ve unpacked everything I’m
staying in Madrid Lorenzo

LORENZO
Are you joking

Lorenzo knows that she isn’t he looks at her
questioningly Julieta is concentrating on making the
tea

LORENZO
But that’s ridiculous
Julieta looks at him in silence It isn’t ridiculous

JULIETA
I won’t be able to go with you

LORENZO
(Alarmed) But what’s happened

She fills her cup with hot water the teabag is in
there She sweetens it with agave syrup

JULIETA
I know you don’t deserve this but
I beg you not to ask me any
questions I’m not going with you
to Portugal I’m staying in
Madrid

Silence broken by Lorenzo
LORENZO
And you’re not going to give me
any explanation

Silence Julieta takes a deep breath

LORENZO
What’s going on Julieta

JULIETA
I’ve given it a lot of thought
and

LORENZO

(Interrupting her) Don’t tell me
you hadn’t thought about it until
now We’ve been planning this for
almost a year

Julieta looks at him mortified

LORENZO
Just yesterday you said “I’d like
not to come back to Madrid if I
can help it” What’s happened so
suddenly

Julieta is still struggling with herself But it’s
obvious she has taken an irrevocable decision
JULIETA
(Weak and decisive) Don’t insist
please

He glares at her Lorenzo’s mouth has gone dry his
palate is sticky

LORENZO
Can I have a glass of water

Julieta takes a bottle from the refrigerator and pours
him a glass of water in silence Lorenzo drinks from
the glass thinking about what to say to her

LORENZO
I don’t recognize you Julieta
Youre behaving like a lunatic

JULIETA
I know

LORENZO
(Powerless) I can’t believe we’re
talking about this

JULIETA

Last night I realized that I was
fooling myself that I don’t want
to leave Madrid and that I
prefer to be alone I’m sorry

Lorenzo glares at her again he knows that he won’t get
another word out of her

LORENZO

I always knew there was something
important in your life that you’ve
never shared with me You never
wanted to talk about it and I’ve
always respected that

JULIETA
(After a brief pause) I’d like you
to keep respecting it

Lorenzo looks at her astonished and humiliated After
looking at her for a moment he turns to the door and
leaves

Julieta gets out of a taxi in front of 19 Fernando VI

8 MADRID 19 FERNANDO VI SUPERINTENDENT’S OFFICE IN
BUILDING INT DAY

2016 SPRING

She comes into the entrance hall The superintendent
comes out Inocencio a simple amiable man pleasant
looking greying hair

From the way they greet each other they seem like old
acquaintances They havent seen each other for some
time but Julieta talks to him as if they had just seen
each other the day before The man doesn’t recognize
her at first

JULIETA
Hello Inocencio

INOCENCIO
Miss Julieta It’s been ages

Inocencio is surprised to see her there Julieta acts
as if she doesn’t notice she’s full of determination

JULIETA
Yes indeed By chance have any
letters come for me

INOCENCIO
(Confused) In all these years
Noo

JULIETA

I’ve just come back to Madrid and
I’d like to rent my old apartment
Is it free

Julieta acts as if this inquiry were the most natural
thing in the world (By this stage the spectator will
think she’s eccentric verging on crazy)

INOCENCIO
(Puzzled) No I thought you’d left

Spain

JULIETA
Yes but I’ve come back And I
miss this street Is there another
apartment free

INOCENCIO
Well the second left is empty

JULIETA
That’s wonderful Can I see it

Inocencio a good simple man of 50 is astonished He
remembers that Julieta had been very ill years ago and
had caused a few scenes before leaving the building
He’s afraid she hasn’t recovered in all these years

INOCENCIO
It’s practically unfurnished and
it hasn’t been painted

JULIETA
That doesn’t matter

9 MADRID FERNANDO VI 19 2™ FLOOR HOUSE 3 INT
DAY

2016 SPRING

Julieta and Inocencio appear at the far end of the
hallway that leads into the apartment’s large sitting
room The color of the walls is different from that of
her old apartment in the same building but the lay-out
and aspect to the street is identical They pause in
the doorway Julieta looks around the room The
superintendent looks at her uncomfortable

The wooden floor is dirty And the walls painted a
greyish green still bear the marks of the previous
tenant’s pictures and furniture There are three
windows without curtains

INOCENCIO
It’s very dirty I warned you

JULIETA
TI’1ll clean it I’1ll take it
Inocencio

A ray of sun comes through each of the three windows
that look out on the street and light up the largest
room On one side there is a fireplace that divides the
wall in two On both sides of the fireplace there are
empty shelves Near the shelves an abandoned stool and
a skay armchair

INOCENCIO
But it’s not ready for anyone to
move in Miss Julieta If you give
me your number I’11 call you

JULIETA
That isn’t necessary really As
long as the bathroom and kitchen
work I can see to the rest

INOCENCIO
(Disconcerted) The bathroom and
the kitchen are new

Sitting on the skay armchair using the stool as a
table she opens the blue envelope we saw in the first
sequence She empties its contents onto the stool The
surface is covered with tiny pieces of a photo that had
been carefully torn up With her hand she spreads out
the pieces of the photo creating a difficult jigsaw

air from her former and current street Seen from below

2016 SPRING

Julieta is sitting in the old skay armchair next to a
simple standard lamp The photo which had been torn
into a thousand pieces and scattered is beside her
intact again

Julieta is holding a thick hard-covered Italian
notebook On the first page she writes the name ANTIA
in capital letters From its position in the middle of
the page Antia is the title of everything she will
write afterwards

The scant initial text is written as a list

Two sons and one daughter
She came down to Lake Como to shop so she lives in a
town where there are few stores Perhaps she lives ina
nearby expensive Swiss town and she went to shop in
Italy which is much cheaper
She doesn’t wear make-up And she’s thin
She thinks I’m still living in Madrid

At dusk she returns to her new apartment weary She

The man lurking there is none other than Lorenzo

NIGHT

2016 SPRING

The windows are still bare The bareness is general
The absence of furniture makes her solitude even more
obvious We can still see some unopened boxes of books

She now has a table where she can write And a good
chair that supports her back And a table lamp In the
background on a sideboard we see four small framed
photos With her parents with Xoan with Ava and with
Lorenzo There are two pictures on the wall

Set out on the table are two jars with pencils and
markers and the hard-backed Italian notebook We also
see the photo which had been torn into a thousand
pieces and is now stuck back together like a jigsaw
puzzle It’s the first time it appears In the photo
Julieta is posing with the adolescent Antia A photo
crisscrossed with scars

The shelves are full of books There is more than
enough space for a woman on her own

Julieta looks at the torn reconstructed photo She
touches it with her fingertips And she starts to
write

JULIETA (OFF)
Dear Antia

She stops How to continue She takes a deep breath
She looks at her daughter in the patched-up photo

JULIETA (OFF)
I’m going to tell you everything I
didn’t have a chance to tell you
because you were a child because
it was too painful for me or
simply out of shame

She stops She looks around with tear-filled eyes
searching for the words She continues

JULIETA (OFF)
But you’re not a child anymore
Beatriz told me that you have
children of your own three no

less You’re a grown woman and a
mother

Where do I begin (She decides)
I’11l tell you about your father
When you asked me how I met him I
told you it was on a train but I
didn’t tell you everything

THIRTY YEARS BEFORE EXT NIGHT
1985 WINTER

(Somewhere between Galicia and Madrid) Before it
appears we hear the sound of the train over the last
written words (we hear these in the voice of mature-
Julieta that is played by the actress with whom the
story begins in 2016 The voiceover is always by the
mature actress)

The train goes through a wooded area
TRAIN SLEEPING CAR APARTMENT INT NIGHT
1985 WINTER

(Actress Young Juliet)

The voiceover is heard over a close-up of Julieta
sitting next to the train window with a book in her
hands She looks at the window as if her own voice 30
years later were coming to her through the glass

JULIETA (OFF)
was 25 It was a very unpleasant
night and there was a lot of
wind”

Suddenly a tree branch carried along by the wind
comes hurtling out of the darkness and slams violently
against the outside of the window as if trying to
break through it the branch clings to the window for a
moment and then disappears torn away by the same wind
like a warning from nature

Julieta looks up from her book startled by the sudden
appearance of the phantom branch Through the window we
can see a wooded countryside and reflected on the
inside of the glass the legs of a man who comes into
the compartment at that moment and stands in front of
her
SAD MAN
Is this seat free

It’s obvious that the seat is free There is no one
else in the compartment nor are there any cases to be
seen Julieta nods still startled by the branch
hitting the window The man places a leather bag on the
luggage net takes off his overcoat and folds it
meticulously He places the coat beside him and sits
down across from Julieta

He’s wearing a sad suit that is too big for him as if
he had lost weight in the last months He’s wearing a
black polo neck sweater and glasses He isn’t a very
attractive man in general his skin is pitted as if
marked by smallpox his expression is as sad as his
appearance

Julieta feels instantly repelled by him apprehensive
she doesn’t want to be infected by his sadness She
looks back at her book an essay titled “Greek
Tragedy” The sad man tries to hide his sadness by
appearing sweet and friendly even beseeching He tries
to strike up a conversation

SAD MAN
That branch was really amazing

Julieta nods slightly

SAD MAN
Did it scare you

JULIETA
Yes it did

And she looks down at her book again in a polite
gesture of rejection Best to discourage him from the
start But the amiable intruder doesn’t give up

SAD MAN
Are you traveling alone

JULIETA
Yes

SAD MAN
When I saw you on your own I
thought That’s good we can keep
each other company

Julieta isn’t interested in the offer All she wants is
to carry on reading and the man facing her is
preventing her from concentrating She’s uncomfortable
she looks sternly at him The man senses the rejection
and blinks confused and sad

SAD MAN
You don’t want to talk What a
pity

He says the last words to himself He suddenly seems
depressed Julieta puts an end to the conversation by
standing up

JULIETA
Excuse me I have to go out

The man looks at her sadly Or perhaps he doesn’t dare
look at her sunk in his own sadness

TRAIN TRAIN CORRIDOR NIGHT
1985 WINTER

Julieta comes out of the compartment Before walking
along the corridor she takes a last look at him The
man watches her leave the compartment

In the corridor she sees two women sitting in the next
compartment The two women look at her too Julieta
heads for the dining car as if fleeing from those
glances

TRAIN DINING CAR NIGHT
1985 WINTER

It’s cold In her hurry Julieta forgot to take her
coat For the moment she doesn’t miss it The windows
here are much bigger than in the compartment There is
just one customer Xoan with his back to her looking
out absorbed at the views through the large windows
A snow-covered landscape

At that moment a stag crosses the surface of the
frozen countryside It is running diagonally towards
the train with no fear of being run over He’s a
magnificent specimen with a brown and silver coat Set
against the white surface of the countryside he looks

like the illustration of a child’s horror story A
hypnotic vision Julieta comes up and looks in
astonishment through the window at the stag running
through the snow Aware that Julieta is standing behind
him Xoan speaks without looking at her

XOAN
I hope he doesn’t get too close to
the train

He’s talking about the stag

JULIETA
He isn’t afraid of the train He’s
looking for a female He smells
her in the air

Xoan finally notices her While they look out at the
running stag Julieta and the stranger Xoan feel
mysteriously connected The couple have become part of
the harmony of the landscape the frozen countryside a
stag with a silvery coat running to meet his beloved
and in the foreground a man and woman watching him
entranced

XOAN

Julieta takes his hand

JULIETA
Julieta

Julieta still has her book in her hand

XOAN
Would you like to have a drink

JULIETA
All right

A waiter comes up Julieta asks for tea

The dining car has the colors and atmosphere of Edward
Hopper’s cafesdiners
Xoan is a strong man his face weathered by the wind
and the sun He has more wrinkles than he should have
at his age A solid attractive man with a disarming
smile who gives off an air of confidence and natural
authority He is ten years older than Julieta that is
thirty five Xoan is the opposite of the man she has
just left in her compartment He doesn’t hide his
interest in Julieta

talk The white lunar landscape is reflected in the
glass They are alone in the dining car We don’t hear
what they’re saying Mature Julieta recounts it in
voiceover
JULIETA (OFF)
I told him I was teaching
Classical Philology standing in
for a teacher who was ill Xoan
told me that he was a fisherman
and he had three gamelas He was
going to Madrid to buy an engine
for one of them He had lived all
his life by the sea in the house
his grandfather had bought when he
came from Cuba
26 TRAIN ENTERING THE STATION EXT NIGHT

1985 WINTER

The train slows down until it stops in the station of a

town The station is at one side of the train There is
snow everywhere except on the platforms protected by
shelters

Three or four passengers all wrapped up get on the
train It is pitch black Only the station chief and
the switchman are left on the platform

TRAIN CONDUCTOR (OFF)
Ten minute stop

Xoan stands up

XOAN
Do you feel like stretching your
legs a bit

Julieta would love to accompany him but she left her
coat on her seat across from the sad man and she
doesn’t feel like going back there for it

JULIETA
I’m not really dressed for the
weather Thank you

XOAN
See you later

And he leaves the carriage Julieta watches him
disappear

A blast of cold air sneaks through the door when Xoan
opens it

Julieta would like to get her coat but she doesn’t want
to meet the man with the pitted skin again Consciously
or not she stays in the dining car waiting for Xoan to
come back She tries to concentrate on her book while
she drinks her tea The title of the book “Greek
Tragedy” by Albin Lesky appears at the bottom of the
frame as if giving the name to what is very shortly
going to happen

TRAIN DINING CAR INT

1985 WINTER SIMULTANEOUSLY

n the dining car the inertia of braking causes
Julieta to fall across the table The cup of tea slides
along the surface and falls to the floor

The braking catches the waiter unawares with his tray
in one hand as he’s serving some customers With his
legs widespread he tries to keep his balance but the
cups and glasses fall to floor and break The bottles
and glasses in the bar accompany the general commotion
jumping around on their shelves

The train finally stops brusquely Julieta leaves the
dining car and heads for her coach and compartment

TRAIN CORRIDOR INT NIGHT
1985 WINTER

The two women from the compartment next to hers come
out into the corridor complaining

WOMAN 1
What happened

Woman 2 is holding her hands up to her head
A young man also comes out into the corridor

YOUNG MAN
The train has stopped

WOMAN 2
Why And so suddenly

The train conductor appears at the far end of the
corridor and walks quickly up to the women and the
young man (hiding his fear so as not to alarm them)
Behind him a drunken disheveled passenger (Man A)
sticks his head out the door of his compartment The
drunk looks at the little group

TRAIN CONDUCTOR
Don’t worry it’s nothing We’ve
just stopped

WOMAN 1
Well a bag fell on my head and
nearly killed me

Julieta appears at the other end of the corridor and
walks uneasily up to the group

Simultaneously Man A (drunk and disheveled) comes out
of his compartment followed by his wife a woman with
large shoulder pads and an uncouth voice They join the
group formed by the young man the train conductor the
two women and Julieta

MAN A
Did we hit something I saw a stag
running beside the train

TRAIN CONDUCTOR
(Rejecting this) No what an idea

WOMAN 1
I saw it too

Julieta remembers the magnificent animal and her heart
sinks to think that it may have been run over by the
train

TRAIN CONDUCTOR
(Firmly) Please go back to your
seats and don’t block the
corridor

The young man obeys

Julieta beside the women from the compartment next to
hers

JULIETA
What happened

WOMAN 2
The train braked so hard a bag
fell on top of me

TRAIN CONDUCTOR
(To Julieta) The train will be
starting up again right away
Please go back to your seats

At the other end of the corridor the drunk man’s wife
is trying to persuade him to go back into their
compartment but the drunk is protesting he wants a
commotion

The train conductor goes in the direction from which
Julieta was coming towards the dining car

Julieta looks into her compartment from the corridor
where she is standing beside the two women She sees
that her case has only slid along the net where she had
left it However the sad man’s bag has fallen to the
floor The overcoat is still where he left it Julieta
notices that the man isn’t there
JULIETA
Have you seen the man who was
sitting here

37 TRAIN JULIETA’S COMPARTMENTCORRIDOR INT NIGHT

1985 WINTER CONT

Julieta nods and goes into her compartment with her
book in her hand

WOMAN 1
I saw him in the corridor He must
be around somewhere

She leaves the book on her seat and picks up the
leather bag from the floor She is surprised that
despite its considerable size the bag doesn’t weigh
anything She puts it on the seat across from her
intrigued

WOMAN 2
When we stopped he got down onto
the platform I saw him walking
through the snow He didn’t have a
coat that’s why I noticed him I
think he was drunk

WOMAN 1
He’s probably still wandering
around the station that’s why
we’ve stopped

Julieta looks out the window and sees the train
conductor running through the snow towards the engine
cab She has the feeling that something serious has
happened

Julieta looks inquisitively at the leather bag in front
of her as if it were a living being She hears the two
women going back to their compartment Finally no one
is looking at her She gets up and gives way to the
temptation of opening the bag She opens the zip and
separates the two sides To her surprise she discovers

that there is nothing inside The bag is totally empty

She goes out to the corridor intrigued and walks in
the opposite direction to the dining car

We see this from outside through the corridor windows
She goes to one of the doors leading to the platform

TRAIN STATION EXT NIGHT CONT
1985 WINTER

Julieta appears at the door leading to the platform
From there she can see a small group of men coming back
from the cab of the train crossing the dark snowy
ground At first she can only make out the silhouette
of the group as it moves Gradually she can make out
the men and finally she can see that they’re carrying a
stretcher Xoan and the train conductor are among them
They are all serious and somber It looks like a
funeral cortege

From where she is (at the train door) Julieta can’t
make out what is on the stretcher Whatever it is it’s
covered by blankets Pale from apprehension she jumps
down onto the platform her feet sink into the snow
She runs coatless towards the group

As soon as he sees her Xoan goes over to her to
prevent her getting closer to the group

TRAIN STATION EXT NIGHT CONT

XOAN
What are you doing here Get back

pneumonia

JULIETA
(Uneasy) What are you carrying on
the stretcher

XOAN
What

JULIETA
Is it the stag

XOAN
No Why do you say that

JULIETA
(Horrified) Then it’s a man

XOAN
(Pleading) Come on get on the
train

Julieta can see in Xoan’s eyes that she’s right The
cortege is transporting a dead man Juliet’s eyes shine
damply in the dark

JULIETA
(Horrified) Oh It’s him That’s
why weve stopped (She looks at
him intensely in search of
confirmation) A man with a black
sweater and glasses

Xoan doesn’t contradict her but neither does he
confirm it Julieta bursts into tears He pulls her
along

XOAN
(Fatherly) Get on the train
please

Xoan puts his arms round her to protect her from the
cold and puts her on the train Julieta takes a last
look at the funeral cortege which is now arriving at
the station building

40 TRAIN JULIETA’S COMPARTMENT INT OF MOVING TRAIN
NIGHT

1985 WINTER

During the ellipsis between the two sequences Julieta
has been crying

Sitting where she had been seated earlier she is
blowing her nose and drying her eyes

Xoan is sitting across from her in the dead man’s
seat

JULIETA
He was sitting there where you
are now

Xoan listens to her in silence an understanding
reassuring silence like someone listening to a child
who is making a drama out of an unimportant problem

JULIETA
He wanted to talk but I was
bothered by the way he was looking
at me and I ran out of here How
was I to know he was feeling so

awful

XOAN
(Serious) Any girl would have done
the same

JULIETA

(Reproaching herself) I should
have realized

XOAN
(Tenderly) Don’t torture yourself
He would still have killed

himself
JULIETA
Why was he carrying an empty
suitcase
XOAN
I don’t know (Explaining) He

didn’t want to attract attention
He had it all planned before he
got on the train No one kills

himself because a pretty girl
doesn’t want to talk to him

Julieta is still upset but Xoan’s presence is more
powerful than the idea of death They exchange knowing
looks not without desire

TRAIN JULIETA’S COMPARTMENT INT OF MOVING TRAIN

NIGHT

1985 WINTER

The scant light in the compartment is coming through
the window Xoan and Julieta are lying in their
parallel seat-beds and facing head to toe They are
alone Julieta has her back to Xoan she is awake and
tense Xoan is lying facing her His eyes run along her
legs her ass and her waist They are barely inches
from each other

To get into that position the bottom of the seat
slides forward and the back reclines legs rest on the
opposite seat The result is a kind of articulated bed
in three parts In this way the six seats end up
becoming three beds

Xoan is lying on the first bed (next to the window) and
Julieta on the second (that is the one in the middle)
There are some eight inches between both beds The
bodies are clothed and they don’t even graze each other
but they feel their closeness multiplied Xoan changes
his position he lies totally parallel to Julieta That
is with his head lined up with hers He lays his head
on the armrest Julieta is breathing unsteadily Xoan
strokes her waist Julieta turns she no longer has her
back to him

JULIETA
I can’t sleep

XOAN
Neither can I

And they kiss with intense pleasure

A shot of the window we only see the edges The night
landscape is racing past in the opposite direction
through areas that are dark greys and greens not snow
covered The only light coming into the compartment is
from the window The glass reflects the couple inside
the compartment making love voraciously It seems that
the fleeting countryside is reflected on the lovers’
skin The vegetation closes to the train increases the
feeling of flight

Two young bodies half dressed escaping from the idea
of death

1985 SPRING
INSIDE A CLASSROOM IN THE SCHOOL

It is year 85 of the last century Julieta is dressed
like a modern girl of that time hair dyed platinum
blonde in a spiky style short leather skirt and a
blouse She is probably the most seductive teacher in
the school

The classroom is full of adolescents Julieta finishes
writing three words in Greek on the blackboard
Thalassa Hals and Pontos
JULIETA
(With her back turned as- she
writes) The three words mean “sea”
in Greek

She turns to the pupils

JULIETA
Pontos is sea and high sea And it
refers to the sea as a road the
road to adventure That is why
Ulysses is the maritime hero par
excellence

Julieta is a very affable teacher who speaks to the
pupils as if they were her equals and teaches them
classical literature as something that is alive She
makes them participate continuously

JULIETA
For example when Ulysses arrives
on Calypso’s island exhausted
after a shipwreck the nymph
Calypso who was unbelievably
beautiful Marcos who do you
think is the most beautiful woman

Julieta goes over to the pupil’s desk Marcos is a very
handsome boy aware of his attractiveness and therefore
sure of himself

MARCOS
You

Laughter from his classmates

JULIETA
That doesn’t count because I’m the
teacher and it isn’t right for
the teacher to have sex with the
pupils Come on tell me someone
else

MARCOS
Kim Basinger

JULIETA
Really lovely much prettier than me

ANOTHER PUPIL
Angela Molina
JULIETA
She’s beautiful too Well the
goddess Calypso was like Kim
Basinger and Angela Molina
together And she offered Ulysses
everything you can imagine Now
Diego

She turns to another pupil

More

JULIETA
Tell me something that she offered
him something really important

DIEGO
(With an Estremaduran accent) Her
body

laughter

JULIETA
That’s the first thing But also
something we all dream about

MALE PUPIL
Eternal youth

JULIETA
Exactly and immortality Yet
Ulysses refused it and set out to
sea facing endless dangers Which
of the three meanings would you
choose to speak of the sea that
Ulysses yearned for

FEMALE PUPIL
Thalassa

JULIETA
(Charming) Nooo

ANOTHER FEMALE PUPIL
Pontos

JULIETA
That’s it pontos The sea the
high sea the road to adventure

The principal invites her to sit in the armchair across

JULIETA
Yes yes

PRINCIPAL
I thought so We have no other

Inside the compartment Julieta is looking out the
window at the spring landscape We hear the contents of
the letter which Julieta is holding in her hands as if
it were a ticket or a passport

XOAN (OFF)
I think of you so much I can’t
get that night on the train out of
my head

Julieta’s breathing is unsteady from excitement She
puts her hand to her stomach

XOAN (OFF)

Ana is still the same or worse
Even though I was only away for
two days when I got back she
looked worse When you’re here all
the time you don’t realize

I didn’t go fishing today that’s
why I’m writing to you The sea is
very choppy and there’ll be a
storm this afternoon

REDES TAXI INTEXT DAY CONT

A taxi is driving along a street in Redes a Galician
town on the coast

XOAN (OFF)
I’d like to see you appearing
through the rain looking for a
place to shelter and that that
place were my home

Julieta is in a local taxi She has very little
luggage a medium-sized bag

REDES XOAN’S HOUSE EXT DAY CONT
1985 SPRING

When we finish hearing Xoan’s voiceover the taxi drops
her in front of a two-storied house whose facade is
mainly a smoky grey color The house has a modernist
influence The door is arch shaped of shotcrete
Before reaching the front door there is an area with
terracotta colored tiles demarcated by a concrete
fence that has a border on its upper part A white
fence The sea can be seen behind the house It is a
very different construction from the other houses along
the street Really they are all different from each
other

Even though it isn’t raining Julieta incorporates the
fisherman’s epistolary desire There she is in front
of his house opening the gate There’s a reddish-brown
dog at the gate jumping around and barking He goes
straight up to Julieta when she approaches the front
door He’s a sturdy pup who could easily knock her to
the ground but he just wants to play She rings the
bell
A woman comes out of the house She shouts at the
animal

MARIAN
Cinnamon

Julieta strokes the dog which reacts with delight

Mariana is 50 year old Galician woman weather-beaten
broad and reserved

MARIAN
Cinnamon Don’t be a nuisance

JULIETA
Hello

Marian looks her up and down She is one of those women
who are proud of themselves and don’t hide the fact
that they’re judging you She doesn’t like the look of
Julieta

MARIAN
I think you’re late The funeral
was yesterday

Julieta doesn’t understand what she means She looks at
her bewildered

MARIAN
But come in if you want and have
some coffee I’m Marian I take
care of the house

Julieta accepts the invitation upset by the news that
someone has died and has already been buried

They walk through a large entrance hall which
communicates with the rest of the house by a door
Seascapes and the oil portrait of a woman from another
era hang on the walls

Marian is a hard woman in every sense and quite ugly
Her eyes are of different colors her hair has a small
casual curl she makes no effort to be pleasant just
the opposite She behaves as if she owns the house She
prejudges Julieta with contempt she thinks she is some
easy conquest of Xoan’s And it shows She has invited
her in to be able to confirm it

REDES XOAN’S HOUSE KITCHEN INT DAY
1985 SPRING

Julieta follow hers into the house On a sideboard near
the entrance is the figure of a boat painted indigo
blue It catches her attention She looks at the piece
with an expert eye

The two women walk from the front door to the kitchen
crossing the entrance and a hallway

MARIAN
When did you meet Ana

Julieta breathes more easily It’s Ana who is dead
Xoan is fine

JULIETA
Ana I didn’t know her

MARIAN

That’s what I thought because Ana
hadn’t been out of here in the
last six years

They go into the kitchen The kitchen looks out on the
sea through three enormous windows The sea fills the
kitchen and Julieta’s eyes

JULIETA
(Dazzled) Oh The sea

MARIAN
It’s very striking the first time
isn’t it Sit down

Julieta obeys and sits at the table in the middle of
the kitchen Marian with her back to her serves her
coffee on the kitchen worktop There are lots of
Sargadelos cups and plates

MARIAN
So you’ve come to see Xoan

Julieta nods and makes a vague sound She had thought
of making some excuse that she was passing through
that she was going to visit a friend who lives in the
area but at the last minute she decides not to It
would be like admitting Marian’s superiority
MARIAN
I don’t think he’ll be back
tonight he’s with Ava

Marian looks at her to see how she reacts She offers
her some cakes which Julieta refuses even though she’s
hungry She only accepts the coffee

MARIAN
Do you know Ava

Julieta shakes her head

MARIAN
She does ceramics and sculptures

Julieta supposes that the sculpture at the entrance
the blue boat must be by her

Maria sits across the table from Julieta As if
guessing what Julieta is thinking

MARIAN

Ava and Ana were good friends
when Ana was still able to talk or
she could listen The poor woman
was like a vegetable and a man
needs a woman (She looks at her
blatantly) but it’s not for me to
criticize Xoan

Julieta is listening to Marian with her empty coffee
cup in her hands

MARIAN
More coffee

JULIETA
No

MARIAN
Then give me the cup and I’11 wash
it

She takes the cup stands up and goes over to the work
top She runs the water while she asks

MARIAN
Well what are you going to do
You can still catch the eight
o’clock bus It passes near here
in the square

Julieta doesn’t react she just looks at her watch
There are almost three hours to go

MARIAN
You can come home with me and then
my husband will take you to the
bus

She goes to get her jacket which is hanging on a hook

JULIETA
I’m tired I’d rather wait here
if you don’t mind

MARIAN
(Scandalized) Where

JULIETA
Right there in the entrance hall

Marian thinks it’s forward of her and rash

MARIAN
On your own

She considers in silence what Julieta’s relationship
with Xoan might be if she speaks like that She thinks
that perhaps it would be presumptuous of her to throw
out a real friend of her boss

From the first moment the meeting between Marian and
Julieta is a confrontation a struggle for domestic
power although it’s senseless and is too soon

Marian gives way although she doesn’t hide her
disapproval and how little she trusts Julieta She
picks up her jacket and purse She changes tactic she
speaks in a friendly tone

MARIAN
I’d stay with you but I can’t
I’ve neglected my husband these
last days

JULIETA
Thank you very much
Marian hates her at that moment She recognizes that
Juliet has been the winner in that first duel In the
entrance hall

MARIAN
(Annoyed) Well anyway Cinnamon
will stay with you

Julieta sits in one of the ugly armchairs in the
entrance hall

JULIETA
Thank you

MARIAN
Be careful not to fall asleep and
miss the bus eh I’1l1 call you on
the phone just in case

JULIETA
You needn’t bother

At the door

MARIAN
I’11 call you

And she leaves the house Julieta relaxes The dog
comes up to her ready to play and she welcomes it
delighted She is alone in Xoan’s house

Everything is neat and tidy Xoan walks along the

slowly and stands in the doorway enjoying what he
sees

Julieta is lying sleeping in the leather armchair
There is a little lamp lit on a low side table The
light bounces off the wall and softly illuminates
Julieta’s seated figure The dog is sleeping beside her
on the floor Xoan doesn’t want to disturb that image
and he doesn’t turn on the overhead light Everything
that isn’t the sleeping Julieta remains in semi-
darkness

He walks quietly over to the armchair so as not to wake
her He takes her in his arms and carries her to the
bed Juliet opens her eyes

XOAN
(Murmuring) Don’t wake up

Julieta is in a rush to explain

JULIETA
I got your letter and I came

XOAN
Shhh

Xoan suggests sweetly that she shouldn’t speak He lays
her on the bed The two start to undress quickly as if
they only had a few minutes Julieta does everything
lying on the bed She unbuttons her blouse Xoan helps
her to pull it over her head He devours her mouth

JULIETA
I never thought that your wife

Xoan doesn’t let her finish he devours her mouth and
her words

XOAN
Don’t think about that now

Xoan sitting on the edge of the bed continues to
undress Julieta her torso naked embraces him from
behind She runs her mouth across his back from
shoulder to shoulder interrupting the kisses to bite
him and smell him She looks for the scent of another
woman the scent of the unknown Ava But she doesn’t
find it Xoan only smells of the sea

is only wearing a shirt of Xoan’s that is too big for
her She is chewing greedily on a local cake while she
fixes breakfast (The same cakes Marian offered her
when she arrived and which she refused)

Julieta smiles at him as if she’s been caught red-
handed But she can hardly speak her mouth is full

JULIETA
These cakes are delicious

XOAN
They’ re typical of here

JULIETA

MUXIA LIGHTHOUSE EXT DAY

A long shot of the lighthouse and the rocks which

surround it and fill the beach In the distance the
Vilan lighthouse

The waves break against the rocks which are sculpted by
the wind and sea Terracotta-colored granite rocks
that over the centuries have acquired strange shapes
pointed or flat as stone flying saucers Some rocks
have incisions on their surface fractures but the
pieces still cling together Rocks with gashes and
scars

It’s a telluric original landscape tense disturbing
very expressive

In the distance we see one of Xoan’s gamelas on the
sea

Xoan and Julieta are entangled in some love play with
the sea as the only witness

To the rhythmic sound of the waves slapping against the
wood of the boat we hear Julieta’s voice The
voiceover continues to be heard over the next sequence

JULIETA (OFF)

I didn’t have a job I wasn’t ina
hurry I thought I’d stay for just
a few days I had to tell Xoan
something but I kept putting it
off It was a new life strange
for a woman who had come from the
sun but welcoming I spent the
nights flying in Xoan’s arms I
felt trapped and free at the same
time

REDES XOAN’S HOUSE XOAN’S ROOM NIGHT

tires of looking at her The image of Xoan looks very

REDES AVA’S STUDIO INT DAY
1985 SPRING
The studio’s interior is very distinctive

Ava is a very attractive interesting woman Work
clothes untidiness suit her Independent sensual and
free at first sight Ava gives off all those qualities

An organized disorder reigns in the studio An
assortment of materials photos that she uses as
sketches male nudes pots of different kinds pieces
half made or done in clay before the mold is emptied
Lots of drawings A few finished pieces The oven

Julieta is immediately interested in Ava’s sculptural
work Pots and male figures She goes over to the table
where the finished sculptures are There is a series of
seated naked men They remind us of Xoan’s posture in
the previous sequence Julieta falls in love with one
of the sculptures

JULIETA
Can I touch it

AVA
Pick it up if you want

JULIETA
Oof It’s heavy

AVA
(Smiling) 10 pounds Be careful

JULIETA
I thought it was terracotta

AVA
It’s bronze At the end I give
them a terracotta glaze that’s the
color of the rocks next to the
lighthouse

JULIETA
(Fascinated by the sculpture) It’s
got such force

AVA
I try to make the sculptures
compact so that the wind can’t
knock them over Like the people
from here The people from here
are very tough

Julieta puts the sculpture back on the table

and she liked me to tell her
mythological stories like I did
with you when you were small

Julieta is having tea and sitting in the armchair in
silence while she watches Ava work The sculptress
picks up a handful of clay and starts to mold it She
has a lit cigarette stuck between her lips She puffs
on it from time to time without using her hands

Julieta looks at Ava’s hands covered with mud
carefully molding a figure

JULIETA

The gods created man and other
beings with the help of clay and
fire They gave them the
attributes they needed for their
survival Some were given fur and
others wings for flying When it
was man’s turn the gods
discovered that they had no gifts
left so man was born naked and
defenseless in the midst of
nature

Ava listens carefully to her she had never thought of
the nakedness and weakness of the first man and she
pities him

JULIETA
I’m pregnant Ava

AVA
By whom

JULIETA
By Xoan I was pregnant when I
came from Madrid

AVA
(Surprised) Ah does he know

JULIETA
No I don’t want to put pressure
on him

AVA
You have to tell him Xoan adores
children

Julieta’s eyes light up
REDES XOAN’S HOUSE EXT DAY
1985 FALL

Xoan comes home after a day’s fishing Cinnamon is
excited and races out to meet him barking frantically
Before he goes into the house when he is at the door
he hears a baby’s cry Xoan disappears into the house
in a flash (Consider this)

IN THE DARKNESS OF A TUNNEL AND INSIDE A TRAIN
1986 WINTER

The train is going through a tunnel The voice emerges
from the transient darkness Xoan Julieta and the
baby two or three months old are on the train

JULIETA (OFF)
A few months after you were born
I took you to your grandparents
so they could meet you and meet
Xoan

INT OF TRAIN EXIT FROM THE TUNNEL

1988 SPRING (In the change of light two years have
passed)

JULIETA (OFF)
Two years later we visited them
again It was urgent so that mom
could see you before it was too
late Grandpa Samuel had taken
early retirement He was the town
schoolteacher and he gave it up
to become a farmer He’d sold the

house where I’d grown up and
bought another in the country

In the same train but crossing an exterior landscape
we see Julieta with Antia two years old (It’s very
early day has just broken)

A RURAL SQUARE IN ANDALUSIA EXT DUSK
1988 SPRING

The square of a little Andalusian town White facades
Trees that offer shade iron benches street lamps a
melon seller with his melon stall one or two gypsy
women little children and one who is 8 years old and
is endlessly plowing through the square on his bicycle
Old men who share the benches with other townspeople
waiting for the bus A few terraces with lines of
washing pots of flowers a neighbor comes out of her
house A colonial style church The square is a
demonstration of the joy color and light of the south

Samuel and Sanda are sitting on one of the metal
benches He is almost 60 his skin hardened by exposure
to the sun He is overflowing with health Sanaa is
young and very beautiful an olive-skinned Maghrebi
woman They look over at an angle of the frame

The front of the bus appears round a corner by the
church

RURAL SQUARE BESIDE THE CHURCH EXT DUSK
1988 SPRING

The bus crosses the frame from left to right blocking
out the square Relatives of the travelers start to
arrive from in front and from behind The two doors of
the bus open Carlos 50 gets out of the rear door As
well as his own bag he has Julieta’s backpack Julieta
gets out after Carlos with the little girl in her
arms She thanks Carlos for his help just as she is
hugged by her father Samuel accompanied by Sanaa
Carlos goes off to the left and effusively kisses a
woman much younger than he is probably his wife

Julieta’s group moves away to leave room for other
travelers getting out and for relatives who have come
to pick them up In this way we also isolate them
Samuel picks up the backpack from the ground He hugs
his daughter and his granddaughter overflowing with
affection

SAMUEL
(To the little girl) But who have
we here She’s got so big Don’t
you have a kiss for grandpa

Samuel hugs his daughter and kisses her In a more
adult tone but happy

SAMUEL
How was the journey sweetheart

JULIETA
Very long You look so handsome

SAMUEL
Youre the two beauties Look I
want to introduce you to Sanaa

Sanda holds out her hand shyly Julieta offers her left
hand She’s holding the little girl with her right so
she makes an apologetic gesture

SAMUEL
Have you got a case

JULIETA
Yes a brown one And the
pushchair

Sanda goes over to the bus’s luggage compartment
Around her the typical hubbub of travelers and
relatives While she talks to her father Julieta keeps
looking at the young Maghrebi woman

JULIETA
What about mom

SAMUEL
She’s fine We’re getting by
Youll see her now How’s Xoan

JULIETA
He couldn’t come He sends you
lots of love (She lowers her

voice) And that girl

SAMUEL

That’s Sanaa the girl I told you

about

JULIETA
(Puzzled) She’s the woman who
helps you

SAMUEL

She looks after your mother and
helps me out with the land We
were really lucky to find her

Sanaa comes back with the case and the pushchair
Samuel gets between Julieta and Sanaa

SAMUEL
Let’s get in the car it’s right

light filters through the windows creating a golden
atmosphere in the interior

JULIETA
Don’t you miss the school

SAMUEL
I don’t have time what with your
mother and the land the days fly

JULIETA
I never thought you’d retire much
less retire early

SAMUEL
It’s better for us like this Your

mother and I always dreamed of
living in the country

Julieta looks at Sanaa

JULIETA
Do you speak Spanish Sanaa

SANAA
(Intimidated) A little
Julieta looks at Sanaéa as if she were examining her

SAMUEL

(Explaining) She speaks it
beautifully it’s just that she’s
a bit shy We met her eight years
ago at the Festival of Ancient
Music in Fez She and your mother
became good friends and we kept in
touch with her It’s lucky that
she’s living with us now

68 AND 69 HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY EXT AND INT DUSK
1988 SPRING

A house in the country simpler and smaller than the
traditional Andalusian cortijo The house has an annex
for storing tools and farming implements There may
also be a little hen house It’s a self-sufficient
place From the house we can see the greenhouse a
structure whose roof is covered by a plastic grid Next
to the house there is a small piece of land with
trellises and seedbeds The entrance to the house is
protected by a vine that filters the sunlight The
place has an impressionist beauty

Julieta Antia (being carried) Sanaa (with the
pushchair) and Samuel with Julieta’s case come into
the plot and walk towards the porch

SAMUEL
The house has no luxuries but
we’ve gained in quality of life

Julieta is carrying Antia The little girl is tired but
for the moment she doesn’t protest and looks all
around interested

JULIETA
Which is mom’s room

Her father points to a little window crossed by the
trunk of the vine

SAMUEL
That window that looks out on the
vine

They go into the house Inside there is a cool
welcoming darkness

SAMUEL
I’1l show you the house later

JULIETA
I want to see mom

SAMUEL
Maybe you’ll be lucky and she’s
awake

They walk along a hall all the walls are whitewashed

HOUSE IN COUNTRY HALL DOOR AND SARA’S ROOM INT

DUSK

1988 SPRING

They go up to the door Samuel takes out a key and
unlocks the bedroom door He conceals his actions with
his body but he knows that Julieta can hear the
unmistakable sound of the lock turning

Samuel goes inside Julieta remains in the hall with
the child in her arms From there she hears her father
murmuring

SAMUEL (OFF)
Sara Julieta is here

As if it were the first time she’s heard that name

SARA (OFF)
Julieta

SAMUEL (OFF)
Yes Julieta our daughter

Sara repeats the last thing Samuel says in a neutral
tone

SARA (OFF)
Our daughter

Julieta is listening to the brief conversation
(petrified) in the hall When she comes into the
bedroom with the child in her arms she erases all
worry from her face she pretends that she’s heard
nothing

JULIETA
(Brightly) Hi mom We’re here

She bends over to kiss Sara (the woman is in bed lying
back on a pillow) still holding the child

Sara looks at them from a vacuum She doesn’t recognize
them This breaks Julieta’s heart but she pretends to
be delighted

JULIETA
Aren’t you glad to see us Look
this is Antia You don’t recognize
her because she’s got so big

Samuel is watching the scene

SAMUEL
I’ve prepared the room across the
hall for you That way you’re
closer

JULIETA
No I prefer to stay here I’11
sleep with mom and Antia can sleep
on that little bed

In one corner there’s a little folding bed

SAMUEL
I’1ll tell Sanda to change the
sheets on the little bed That’s
where she sleeps

HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY SARA’S BEDROOM NIGHT
1988 SPRING

Julieta is sleeping in the bed with her mother They
are lying facing each other with their eyes closed The
folding bed has been placed on Julieta’s side The
three generations are sleeping very close to each other
in parallel beds

Sara opens her eyes wakes and discovers Julieta in
front of her inches away She isn’t scared or
startled She touches her face The encounter in the
same bed is a pleasant surprise She murmurs

SARA
Julieta

Julieta opens her eyes slowly Despite the darkness she
can see that her mother recognizes her There is life
in Sara’s eyes the opposite to the opacity when they
arrived

JULIETA
Mom

SARA
What are you doing here

JULIETA
I’ve come to see you I’ve brought
Antia

SARA
Who

JULIETA

Antia my daughter

over and look down at Antia’s little bed The child is
fast asleep The two women look at her delighted

JULIETA
Look at her

SARA
She’s beautiful

JULIETA
She’s two years old now

SARA

She sees Samuel and Sanda working on the plot of land
next to the house They seem to complement each other
they look at ease and happy Samuel says something and
Sanda laughs The man can’t contain himself and he
gives her a quick passionate kiss Sanaa pushes him
away gently and scolds him without losing her smile
They don’t suspect that Julieta is looking at them

HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY EXT DAY CONT
1988 SPRING

The vine is projecting patches of light on the white
facade of the house To complete the impressionist
scene Julieta Antia and Sara the latter a little
hesitant appear at the door Julieta wants her mother
to get fresh air and some sun filtered by the vine
Julieta has put Sara in a dress from the ‘70s which
looks impeccable on her She is also wearing sunglasses
from that time (twelve years earlier when Sara was a
coquettish woman and dressed as such) Julieta has put
some make-up on her and styled her hair a little Sara
looks wonderful The three generations sit at a table
under the vine

Samuel and Sanaa are still working the land When
Samuel realizes that Julieta has brought Sara outside
he turns to them Everything in the scene is beautiful
and breathes life the countryside the house the sun
little Antia Samuel’s arousal and sweat the beauty
and youth of Julieta and Sanaa Even Sara in her
vegetative way is radiant in her distance

Samuel had forgotten how pretty his wife was Sanaa
looks at the family group as if she’s been caught out
Samuel breaks the impasse speaking to the child

SAMUEL
Come here Antia I’1ll give you
some delicious strawberries

JULIETA
Not now dad I’ve just dressed
her Aren’t you going to say
anything to mom

With true admiration and surprise

SAMUEL
You look beautiful Sara

Sanaa looks at them a little uncomfortable She feels
like an intruder

HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY KITCHEN INT

Sanaa her back turned is heating some glass jars with
preserves in the bain marie Julieta in profile is
preparing the little girl’s supper Samuel with his
back to the women and facing the camera is sitting at
a round table peeling some tomatoes

SAMUEL
Great

JULIETA
Dad can I speak to you

SAMUEL
(To Sanda) Sanda see to Sara and
Antia

Sanda cleans her hands before she leaves

JULIETA
Don’t waken Antia

Sanda nods and goes out Julieta sits down across from
her father and helps him peel tomatoes

JULIETA
What do you do about mom when you
go to the market

SAMUEL
One of us always stays with her

JULIETA
When you came to collect me you’d
left her on her own locked in her
room

It’s a critical painful comment said in a half
whisper

SAMUEL
I don’t like locking her in
Julieta I do it to protect her

JULIETA
(Lamenting) This is no life for
mom

SAMUEL

(On the defensive) Julieta we are
as well as we can be Do you know
what it would cost to put your
mother in a home

JULIETA
I thought you’d hired a woman to
look after her

SAMUEL
Sanda looks after her

JULIETA
Sanda looks after the land and
you

SAMUEL
(Warning her) Don’t go there
Julieta

JULIETA

Mom needs something more than just
someone to wash her and make her
bed

SAMUEL
You have your life unfortunately
very far from here I’ve tried to
bother you as little as possible
but we’ve had a lot of problems
and believe me if I tell you that
now we’re better than ever

Julieta looks at him with mixed feelings
SAMUEL
Be more understanding and more
generous with me

feminine than masculine They’ve changed some of the
furniture and the curtains Antia’s cot is next to the
bed

Julieta gives a final touch to Antia’s bed the child

is fast asleep Xoan undresses sitting on the bed
They speak in whispers so as not to wake Antia

The sea is reflecting the white blue and red of Xoan’s
gamela Inside the little boat Antia (8 years old) is
helping her father pull the creels out of the water
She’s wearing a yellow oilskin and is having a
wonderful time fishing

Over these images we hear Julieta’s voiceover

JULIETA (OFF)

I wonder if you’re living inland
or on the coast and if you still
like fishing When you were eight
you were already going out with
your father in the boat You
wanted to be a fisherman like
him

Time has passed for all the characters Julieta at 38
is in all her splendor Xoan close to 50 is starting
to show signs of weariness and his hair is greying
Antia has grown she is 12 now

Julieta is combing Antia’s hair in the girl’s room On
the wall there is a corkboard full of photos with her
father and with her girlfriends and also some childish
drawings The window is casting a warm intimate light
on the scene Julieta loves combing her daughter’s
hair but Antia is in a bad mood and in a sign of
protest has let all her hair fall over her face She
looks like “Cousin Itt” from the Addams Family She
protests when her mother insists on combing her hair
properly

JULIETA
How can I let you go to camp
looking like “Cousin Itt” from the

Addams

ANTIA
(Sulking willful) I want to go
like this

Julieta pulls her hair back from her face as if it were
a curtain from behind which the different features of
her face start to appear She names them lovingly
JULIETA
People have to see that you have a
forehead that you have eyes a
nose a mouth ears

Antia interrupts her ill-humoredly

ANTIA
Mom don’t talk rubbish

JULIETA
(Scolding her) Antia you’re going
on vacation you’re going to enjoy

yourself

ANTIA
I don’t want to go I want to stay
here

JULIETA

(Fed up) Well the young lady
can’t always do what she wants to
do

Xoan comes into the bedroom He goes up to Julieta and
Antia The girl hugs him tightly Julieta carries on
combing her hair as if nothing had happened

XOAN
(Tenderly) What’s wrong with my
little girl

ANTIA
I don’t want to go dad Now that
I’m on vacation I could go fishing
with you every day Didn’t you say
that you needed help that you
were getting old

Xoan adores his daughter He caresses her

XOAN
promise that when you come back
‘ll take you on as a deckhand
OK

ANTIA
‘ll hold you to that

The mother breaks the embrace between Antia and Xoan to
take the child away

Julieta and Antia disappear along the hall
REDES XOAN’S HOUSE ENTRANCE HALL INT DAY

1998 SUMMER

Marian is going grey she’s fatter but she is still
full of the same energy She is vacuuming the dust in
the entrance hall with a noisy vacuum cleaner When she
sees Antia and Julieta coming through the door she
turns off the vacuum and greets the child with open
arms Antia huddles in her arms Julieta is carrying a
little suitcase and she looks impatiently at the scene

MARIAN
Are you leaving already Antia
You’1l come and visit me at home
when you get back won’t you

ANTIA
Won’t you be here

MARIAN
No love I won’t be here

Maria looks reproachfully at Julieta This annoys
Julieta All these years her dealings with Marian have
been full of these kinds of indirect looks and
resentful silences Fortunately Marian will be leaving
in a few days

MARIAN
But you have to promise you’ll
come and see me

ANTIA
Yes I promise

Antia doesn’t break away from Marian who covers her
forehead with tender kisses Julieta watches the scene
impatiently And again she has to break Antia’s embrace
and pull her something that obviously annoys her

JULIETA

Come on let’s go
ROAD TO THE MEETING POINT EXT DAY
1998 SUMMER
Inside the car

Julieta is driving the girl to an old bus station ina
nearby town Antia is still sulking

ANTIA
Why is Marian leaving

JULIETA
(Surprised) Her husband is’ sick
She’s going to look after him

ANTIA
You’re not throwing her out

JULIETA
That’s silly Of course not

ANTIA
If you asked her to stay I bet
she would

JULIETA
Antia people have a right to
retire

The explanation doesn’t convince the girl and annoys
the mother

MEETING PLACE A FORMER BUS STOP EXT DAY
1998 SUMMER

The meeting place is an unused bus stop Julieta
doesn’t know the other mothers who are saying goodbye
to their children amidst a great rumpus There are boys
and girls

Julieta accompanies Antia to the door of the bus They
hug Julieta isn’t as firm as she was at home or on the
drive there The girl realizes how fragile she is and
changes her attitude
ANTIA
(Affectionately) I’m sorry if I
was being mean

Julieta smiles at her and shakes her head

JULIETA
Don’t worry Call us as soon as
you get there

ANTIA
OK

Antia gets into the bus with her little case Julieta
looks for her at the windows She says goodbye from
outside Antia is looking out one of the windows and
waving goodbye

Julieta raises her right hand to her ear indicating
that she should call her On the wall in the background
there are several local posters advertisements for
concerts in discotheques the announcement of a
demonstration in favor of the “Historical Memory” “Non
des o esquecemento” says the poster No to forgetting

85 REDES XOAN’S HOUSE SITTING ROOM THREE DAYS LATER
IN THE MORNING

1998 SUMMER

Julieta is looking for some books on the top shelves of
the bookcase text books she used when she was
teaching It seems that the little sitting room is for
her personal use As well as the bookcase there is a
sideboard full of Sargadelos ceramics two pictures
one of them with a mythological theme (Orpheus and
Eurydice be Erasmus Quellinus a disciple of Rubens) A
couch an armchair and a table with a maritime motif
Next to the couch there is a telephone and on the wall
opposite a medium sized television of the time

Marian takes a look around the kitchen Then she walks
slowly to the door of the little sitting room It
saddens her to say goodbye to the house More amiable
than usual

MARIAN
Do you want me to fix you
something for dinner before I
leave
From the exchange of looks when Antia said goodbye to
Marian Julieta is longing for the servant to leave
She answers her politely but coldly

JULIETA
You needn’t bother Inés should be
here soon

Marian was expecting a warmer farewell but Julieta
continues with what she’s doing not paying her much
attention

MARIAN
If you can’t find anything call
me at home

JULIETA
Thank you

Julieta is still absorbed looking for a book that she
can’t find Marian looks nostalgically along the hall
As Marian doesn’t move from the door Julieta turns to
her and sees that she’s wearing a black sweatshirt that
belongs to Xoan

MARIAN
Well I’11 be going

JULIETA
Are you wearing Xoan’s sweatshirt

Marian feels insulted and glares at Julieta Hurt and
categorical

MARIAN
Xoan gave it to me a while ago
I’m not taking anything that isn’t
mine

Despite her abrasiveness Julieta doesn’t notice the
change of expression in Marian’s dissimilar eyes

MARIAN
Are you serious about giving
private classes

JULIETA
Yes

MARIAN
I think you’re making a mistake

Julieta is amazed by the presumptuous comment and is
about to say to her “It’s none of your business” but
she restrains herself She doesn’t want to say goodbye
to Marian with the confrontation which both have
managed to avoid for years

JULIETA
I don’t want to be just a
housewife Marian I have a

profession that I like and I’ve
wanted to go back to it for some
time

MARIAN
(Declaring) A woman’s profession
is her family If you want to keep
it united it’s best to stay at
home

Marian no longer hides her fury at Julieta she has
nothing to lose now

JULIETA
(Dryly) That’s my business

MARIAN
(Murmuring) If you go the same
old thing will happen

Julieta glares at her

JULIETA

What do you mean What same old

thing
Marian looks at her defiantly and goes to speak

comes in sad and tense

XOAN
Has Marian left

JULIETA
(Serious) Yes The new woman is
due to arrive I hope she’s more
discreet

XOAN
Why do you say that

JULIETA

When I came thirteen years ago
Marian told me not to wait for
you you were spending the night
with Ava Just now when she was
saying goodbye she said something
similar that when I went with
Antia to see my parents ten years
ago you spent the nights with Ava
again

The ringing of the doorbell interrupts Xoan’s silence
Julieta goes out to see who it is Xoan imagined that
some day they’d have to talk about this

I’ve known Ava since I was

saying
deeply

Julieta looks at him in silence She picks up the books
she was looking for in the last sequence with Marian
Then she goes to the kitchen Xoan follows her like a

guide dog

XOAN
I often thought about telling you
but I didn’t know how

Julieta looks at him again She takes a purse from a

chair

XOAN
I’m not much of a talker you’ll
have realized that But Antia and
you are the most important things
in my life you know that don’t
you

Julieta goes into the hall turns her back on him
takes a light jacket and puts it on She hangs the

purse over her shoulder

XOAN
Aren’t you going to say anything

JULIETA

XOAN
What are you going to do

JULIETA
I’m going for a walk and to
prepare my classes

XOAN
(Bewildered) I I think I’1l go
fishing

He had decided to stay at home but after talking to
Julieta he prefers to go out fishing Before going to
the door Julieta turns to him Xoan is looking at her
concerned Now that the subject has blown up he’d like
to talk it out and he’d like her to do the same to
insult him if she wants anything but that toxic
silence But Julieta can’t bear Xoan’s pleading
expression

Once she has showered dried herself and changed her

clothes she is filled by a feeling of extreme
loneliness

She walks past the door of Antia’s room She looks
inside she sees her daughter’s bed the posters on the
walls She misses her dreadfully Finally she looks at
the unfinished creel that Xoan was making and that he
left on Antia’s desk

Julieta comes into the kitchen in a housecoat Through
the windows she sees the sea still very rough but
less so than when we saw it at Muxia Beach To fill the
time she starts to prepare dinner very meticulously
dinner for two She pours herself a glass of vinho
verde to cheer herself up She wants Xoan to come back
She regrets not having let him talk

Dinner is sitting on the hot plates Julieta has
another glass of wine and lights a cigarette She has
the radio tuned to the local station they’re talking
about the storm that has suddenly hit the area

“a sudden change in the direction and force of winds
in the area of the Ferrol estuary This change is
causing heavy seas with waves from 20 to 25 feet all
fishing and sailing activity should be suspended in
this area”

Naturally she thinks about Xoan and is worried Did he
go out fishing as she thought she heard him say before
she left the house Is he with Ava The best way to
find out would be to call her but for the moment she
rejects the idea

Julieta is waiting in the sitting room in front of the
television The evening news is talking about a probe
that Japan has sent to Mars

It’s 1100 pm Xoan still hasn’t returned and Julieta
is desperate She thinks he’s with Ava but she needs
to be sure After many doubts she dials Ava’s number

The artist is in her studio busy on one of her
sculptures The phone rings She answers

JULIETA
Ava I’m sorry to call you I just
wanted to know if Xoan is with

you
AVA
Xoan No
JULIETA
Do you have any idea where he
might be
AVA

Hasn’t he come back yet

JULIETA

AVA
(Uneasy) Did he go fishing

JULIETA
I hope not Look at the storm
Wait they’re saying something on

“Maritime Safety has reported the sinking of a gabela
three miles north of the mouth of the Ferrol estuary
Its occupant has not yet been located and there are
serious fears for his safety given the conditions at
sea

A pleasure boat with a crew of three is in the same
situation Rough seas with waves of over 20 feet have
impeded any rescue attempts by Civil Protection As
soon as it dawns and conditions at sea improve”

Julieta is listening to the television the phone still

BUILDING FISHERMEN’S GUILD TWO DAYS LATER EXT DAY
1998 SUMMER

It is a two-storied building with a narrow tower topped
by a clock that is broken a piece is missing from the
face Time has been broken rather than stopped

The sequence begins with a close-up of the broken
clock a downward crane shot shows us a police four-
wheel drive arriving An officer and Julieta are in it
The car stops at the front door of the building

BUILDING FISHERMEN’S GUILD INT DAY
1998 SUMMER

Julieta and the police officer come into an open
informal area where pieces of fishing gear have been
left piled up against the wall Julieta is wearing
large dark glasses and has a black scarf on her head

There are two people there a judge and a seaman in
working clothes who is trying to tidy things up a bit
There are creels enormous blue and red marker buoys
several wine colored nets etc And in the middle of
the room a long very old metal table (used for
cleaning and sorting fish) with an opening at one end
for drainage A blanket has been spread on the table
On top of the blanket is a body covered from head to
toe by a sheet The sheet is clinging to the body and
describes precisely its orography The body is not
complete we can make out that one of the legs is
missing

The judge introduces himself to Julieta

JUDGE
I am Judge Vicente Louro Before
the body can be removed I need you
to identify it

Juliet nods very slightly She looks silently at the
orography of the body through the sheet a landscape

covered by the cloth that falls into emptiness at the
area of the legs

JUDGE
I’m sorry to have to put- you
through this The storm was’ so
fierce that the body isn’t
complete

Julieta seems doped she still doesn’t speak She
waits

The judge pulls the sheet back as far as the corpse’s
chest Julieta looks as if she is staggering as if she
might collapse on the floor but she remains rigid She
focuses on one of the shoulders

BUILDING FISHERMEN’S GUILD INT DAY
1998 SUMMER

Although the skin is badly eroded Julieta can
recognize her and Antia’s initials over the little boat
inside a heart tattooed on the corpse’s shoulder (In
an extreme close-up her hand slides along the eroded
skin on the shoulder until it touches the tattoo)

A car arrives at the last stretch to which there is
access near the cliff Ava and Julieta get out
Julieta is carrying an urn with Xoan’s ashes The two
widows go to entrust to the sea what this has already
taken from them There is a dense light

The place has a fierce vitality The waves are breaking
and multiplying against the cliff There is a natural
dialog between the passion of the sea and the passive
resistance of the rocks Juliet empties Xoan’s ashes

into the sea A wave like a tongue scoops up the
ashes forcefully as if it were an offering from
Julieta which the goddess of the sea is accepting with
pleasure

REDES XOAN’S HOUSE INT DAY

Julieta and Ava come into the house their skin and
hair still damp

They have just closed the door when the house phone
rings Julieta is paralyzed as if it were a call from
the beyond

AVA
Wait I’1ll get it

Julieta goes into the kitchen but she’s stopped by
Ava’s voice

AVA

talk to you

Ava has answered the phone in the sitting room Julieta
looks at her confused

JULIETA

Julieta doesn’t feel she has the strength but she can’t
refuse She goes into the sitting room and makes an
enormous effort so that her voice shouldn’t betray what
she is going through

Julieta is walking with Bea and Antia through the Plaza
de Alonso Martinez the same place (filmed with the
same lens) where we’ve seen her walking in 2016 Bea’s
mother’s clothes fit her perfectly and aren’t those of
someone who is in deep mourning The two adolescents

It’s the same open air basketball court from seq 157

integrated and enthusiastic about her new life Julieta
looks at them absently although this scene (the girls
happily playing basketball) will be engraved on her

We see them advancing (towards camera) through a long
hall that leads to the main room which is very large
with three windows looking out on the street The girls
are holding hands The wallpaper in the room has
slightly jarring figurative motifs There is very
little furniture just enough A large couch tables
It’s a place that someone has just left Julieta looks
apprehensively at the wallpaper

JULIETA
(In a faint voice) The wallpaper
is a bit overwhelming

BEATRIZ
No it’s cool

ANTIA

If we get bored we’ll paint it
(To the superintendent) We’1ll take
it

BEATRIZ
This way we’re very close

The girls go over to the window they open it wide and
the sounds from the street fill the room with life
Julieta follows them but doesn’t have the strength to
accompany them to the window and share their
enthusiasm She falls on the couch and lays her head on
the back

(The planning is identical to Seq 8 when Julieta
walks along the corridor with Inocencio and arrives in
the sitting room and sees the three windows It’s
important to give the idea of repetition as previously
on the basketball court and walking through Alonso
Martinez)

Bea

Antia smiles fondly at Bea over her mother’s head and
thanks her for her help Looking at the image of the
three in the mirror Antia finishes rubbing her
mother’s head which is completely covered by the towel

ANTIA
(To Julieta) Now T’il finish
drying you with the hair dryer

She delicately removes the towel from her head and what
emerges is the face of the new actress who from now on
and until the end will play Julieta the same actress
we’ve seen at the beginning of the story in 2016 This

Julieta holds back her tears She watches her daughter
go out through the door and close it after her She
stands in the hallway

Saying goodbye to Antia reminds her of two other
goodbyes that of the sad suicidal man in the
compartment of the train and that of Xoan in the
hallway of their house in Redes Two pleading
expressions that are engraved indelibly on her memory

car switches on a little pilot light takes a piece of
paper and places it next to the steering wheel It’s a

vehicle with very bad suspension

The car lurches along the path and although Juliet
slows down she is constantly jolted around inside the
car The surroundings are spectacular but the damn
track is hell

The map shows a flat open space The car arrives there
At the end of an impassible track she can make out an
isolated stone house

PYRENEES ISOLATED STONE HOUSE EXT DAY

Julieta stops the car She gets out with Antia’s map in
her hand The stone house which looks impregnable has
a fence that runs around a lush green meadow In the
middle of the meadow there are two benches next to a
table all made of wood and very rudimentary Really
they are just three wooden planks on which you can sit
and rest your elbows The house is the only visible
construction in the middle of nature

Julieta sees a woman Liliana who comes up to her
Liliana is dressed neutrally tending towards the
masculine and speaks with an accent from some country
in Eastern Europe She greets her

JULIETA
I’m Antia Feij6o’s mother

She shows her the map Liliana doesn’t need to look at
it

JULIETA
I arranged to pick her up today

LILIANA
Follow me

Julieta follows her Close by there’s a tractor and in
the distance two cows Nature is exuberant there
wherever you look

JULIETA
What a magnificent place And it
couldn’t be more isolated

They arrive in silence at the door of the house
Liliana goes in and immediately a woman comes out
dressed in a knitted sweater and Jeans Casual
hairstyle her face free of make-up She greets Julieta
with a hospitable smile

JUANA

JULIETA
Yes I’m Antia’s mother

They shake hands

mountain in the background

along with the map her daughter sent her

JULIETA
I can’t wait to see her These

JUANA
Of course

Julieta takes her cup Juana’s calm and coldness
intimidates her
JULIETA
I realize you have your reasons

but the lack of communication all
this time has been very difficult

Juana takes a sip from her cup

JULIETA
Will I have to wait very long

JUANA
Julieta the fact is Antia isn’t
here

JULIETA
(Disconcerted she looks around)
Isn’t this the house

She shows her the map

JULIETA
I followed the directions on the
map

JUANA

Yes this is the house When Antia
wrote to you she thought she’d be
here but in the end she decided
to leave

JULIETA
(Complaining) She could have let
me know I’ve driven here from
Madrid

JUANA
I know

Julieta doesn’t hide her annoyance
JULIETA

And where did she go I hope it’s
near here

JUANA
(She drinks takes her time) I
can’t tell you

Julieta thinks she has misunderstood her

JULIETA
What

With the same serenity and leaving no room for doubt
JUANA
I can’t tell you where she is I’m
sorry

Julieta doesn’t understand the situation Disconcerted

JULIETA
(Reproachfully) You mean you don’t
know You’re in charge here

JUANA
Id be lying if I said no Antia
asked me not to tell you

JULIETA
(Incredulous) This is ridiculous
Are you insinuating that my
daughter doesn’t want to see me

police
JUANA

best if you started to accept
reality I understand that this
isn’t easy

JULIETA
What did you do to my daughter in
these three months

JUANA
We helped her Your daughter
arrived here in a state of extreme
need

Julieta gets worked up
JULIETA

Need Of what She’s never
wanted for anything
JUANA

Nevertheless she felt very
unhappy Here she discovered that
her life was lacking a spiritual

dimension

What do you mean

JULIETA

JUANA

I understand that your daughter
didn’t grow up in a home based on
faith And she found that here

JULIETA

(Beside herself) I want her to

tell me
she

that herself Where is

JUANA

I can’t tell you

Julieta is gripped by panic At no point does she get
the impression that Juana is lying or bluffing In the
same tone of moral superiority and condescension

Shots inside Juliet’s car as half-crazed she goes

back to Madrid

The months of searching are reflected
in her wild-eyed expression as she drives under the
vault of an endless tunnel

JULIETA (OFF)

I reported your disappearance to
the police I hired a private
detective For the first months I
did nothing but look for you every
way I could The only thing I
discovered was how little I knew
you

2004 FALL

Julieta puts a cake in the middle of the dining room
table A perfectly round cake an explosive red color
She sticks two wax numbers in the center of the cake a
1 anda 9 Nineteen

JULIETA (OFF)
On your 19th birthday I bought
you a cake

She hears the doorbell Julieta answers immediately A
mail man has brought a registered letter She has to
sign for it The address is hand-written and Julieta
recognizes the writing It’s her daughter Antia’s

Her heart leaps There’s no return address As she
closes the door she is already tearing open the
envelope All she finds inside is a birthday card It’s
a neutral impersonal card It has a little pop-up vase
of flowers and the words “Happy Birthday” There is
nothing hand written Not even a signature Nothing

She inspects the stamps but she doesn’t find any clue
there

In the kitchen she takes the cake and furious throws
it in the garbage

JULIETA (OFF)
I guess that with that brutally
impersonal card you wanted to let
me know that you were all right

2004 FALL
Julieta is at her computer in the sitting room

Almost the entire screen is filled with the photo of a
boy 6 or 7 years old dark and beautiful Julieta is
looking at him closely There is a written message at
the top of the screen A message from Samuel her
father

Her cell phone rings she has it next to her She can
see who is calling it’s her father She hesitates up
to the last minute before answering it

In the Andalusian house Samuel is sitting on a chair
selecting potatoes from a basin In the background
Sanaa is gathering clothes that had been hanging to dry
in the sun and beside him sitting on the ground is
his seven year old son playing with pieces of Lego

(Samuel has less hair and his beard is very white
Sanaa however looks wonderful It’s been 16 years since
we saw her for the first time accompanying the father
when they collected Julieta and her little girl from
the bus stop)

JULIETA
Hello dad

SAMUEL (OFF)
Hello Julieta Did you see the
photo I sent you

JULIETA
I’m looking at it now

SAMUEL
You see how handsome your brother
is

The child takes a break from his Lego building to look
at his father

JULIETA
(To comply) Yes he’s very
handsome
Sanda appears and sits next to Samuel listening
carefully to the phone conversation

SAMUEL
When are you going to come and
meet him

JULIETA
I can’t right now dad I told
you I’m really busy I’m sorry
but I have to go now I’11 call
you OK

SAMUEL
Stop punishing me Julieta Have I
no right to be happy after your
mother’s death

JULIETA
I’d rather not talk about mom’s
death

SAMUEL
Remember that you’re still my
daughter and Antia is my

granddaughter The last time I saw
her she was still a child Give
her lots of kisses when you see

her

JULIETA

BIRTHDAY DAY AND NIGHT

2005 FALL

Julieta finishes putting a birthday cake in the center
of the table in the sitting room It has two candles
one the number 2 and the other a 0

She sits down to wait She drinks white wine while she
waits

The light coming through the window gradually changes
until night falls She has got dressed put on make-up
and fixed her hair for the wait

At night when it is impossible for any card to arrive
like the year before she takes the cake and throws it
in the garbage can in the kitchen

JULIETA (OFF)

For the first three years I
bought you a cake on your
birthday I was consoled by the
idea of celebrating the arrival of
a card from you and at least
seeing your handwriting on the
address I didn’t expect more but
even that was expecting too much
The first three years throwing a
cake in the garbage to celebrate
your birthday became a tradition

2006 FALL

After throwing out the third cake the one for the 21
birthday Julieta explodes into an uncontrollable
catharsis and continues throwing things on the floor
She’s beside herself

She goes into Antia’s room She opens closets and
drawers and destroys all her belongings She rips up
all the photos the ones stored in a drawer and the
ones in frames (The torn-up photo that was kept ina
blue Christmas card-sized envelope and then stuck back
together is in a frame on the bedside table) She takes
the ball and throws it out the window into the inner
patio She breaks or rips everything she finds to hand

She only respects the mementoes of Xoan

Inocencio greets to her a little intimidated
JULIETA
Inocencio I’m giving up the
apartment I’m leaving Spain

INOCENCIO
Oh when are you giving it up

JULIETA
As soon as possible Within a
week I apologize for the

commotion last night

complained

JULIETA

The two men we saw in the previous sequence put the
black plastic bags into a truck parked at the front
door of the building

JULIETA (OFF)

that you had never set foot in I
wanted to live in a place where
there was no trace of you so that
nothing would remind me of you

wheeled suitcase

2006-2007 FALL

The interior of an impersonal apartment decorated so
that anyone could live there Functional and anonymous
Julieta puts a photo of her with her parents on a
shelf another with Xoan and another with Ava There is
only the most essential furniture and the walls are
painted white without a single adornment

It’s the same place where we saw her at the beginning
in 2015 with Lorenzo but with fewer things An

aseptic impersonal place with no trace of Antia

This house is the denial of the house in which she
lived with Antia

Julieta is waiting for the elevator She’s distracted

Lorenzo Gentile comes out of the elevator He looks at
her quite openly Julieta is still an attractive woman
She rejects Lorenzo’s frank stare and looks at the back
of the elevator towards which she’s walking Avoiding
his eye means she almost bumps into him Lorenzo
apologizes although it’s her fault

Lorenzo stands outside watching Julieta disappear into
the elevator

AVA’S ROOM CLINIC INT DAY
2006-2007

Julieta comes into Ava’s room The sculptress has aged
naturally but she is still a very pretty woman despite
her grey hair and the wrinkles She’s very weak but
she still maintains her self-assurance Julieta leaves
the flowers on the bed and kisses Ava who is sitting in
a hospital armchair We suppose that they have already
seen each other and talked of their mutual problems on
other occasions

JULIETA
How are you sweetheart

AVA
Well the last flare-up
immobilized all my left side How
are you getting on in the new
apartment

JULIETA
(With no enthusiasm) Better it’s
like I was living in another city

Julieta goes over to the only table to put the flowers
in a vase

AVA
They’ re beautiful

Julieta sees the cover of a book that is next to the
vase The book is titled “Adids volcan” (Lorenzo
Gentile is the author) and the illustration on the
cover is one of the “seated men” sculpted by Ava

AVA
I’ve got a present for you too
it’s in the bag

Ava is talking about a little bag that is on the table
Julieta opens it the gift is enveloped in plastic
bubble wrap Julieta guesses what it is

JULIETA
(Moved) A seated man (She presses
it against her breast) Thank you
Ava

She sits in another armchair across from the patient
and leaves the sculpture still in bubble wrap ona
little table between them

AVA
Before you go I want to tell you
something Julieta It doesn’t

explain anything but

Julieta thinks it’s some secret about Xoan
JULIETA
(Weak) You don’t have to Ava
Everything has been clear between
us for a long time

AVA
(Slight smile) It’s about Antia

Julieta’s attitude changes If it’s about Antia she
The wound
is still raw even though she has moved house and
erased all traces of her daughter

wants fervently to hear it whatever it is

AVA
When we went to close up your
house in Redes Marian came and
told her all the details about
Xoan’s last day Your argument my
visit and how Xoan put out to sea
even though it was very rough that
day

143 FLASHBACK HOUSE IN REDES INT NIGHT

Marian knocks at the door of Xoan’s house
along the hallway to open the door
Ava interrupts what she’s doing and comes
She finds Marina and Antia
They look at Ava

her breast
out to see who has arrived
locking in an understanding embrace

as if she were the intruder

144 AVA’S ROOM CLINIC INT DAY CONT

2006-2007

Julieta shakes her head her hatred

JULIETA
(Indignant) But Marian wasn’t
there she’d gone to her own house
by 1100

AVA
She told us that Xoan called her
to ask what you’d talked about

returning

JULIETA

Antia runs

of

hug her and cry on

Marian
(Puzzled) Antia didn’t say
anything to me She never asked me
anything

AVA

She did ask me she wanted me to
confirm if you’d argued because of
me and if it was true that the
sea was choppy I had no idea
about the state of the sea As for
the rest I told her that they
weren’t subjects to discuss with a
child She went crazy she told me
I was a whore and blamed you and
me for Xoan going fishing

Julieta listens to her overwhelmed (She thinks of her

own guilt complex about Xoan’s death but

she

was

careful never to say a word about it to her daughter)

JULIETA
I don’t understand She never
reproached me about it We didn’t
talk much it’s true but
adolescents are mysterious and I
didn’t want to pester her

Ava takes a deep breath to continue

AVA
She rang me the same day she left
on her trip

JULIETA
(Surprised) She rang you I didn’t
know

2006-2007
AVA
She asked me the same questions
again Only one detail had

changed the guilt had spread to
the three of us she was including
herself

JULIETA
And why did she feel guilty

AVA
She’d been away having a good
time at camp

Julieta listens shocked Every word that Ava says
increases the conviction that her daughter was a
stranger that she didn’t know her

AVA
I told her that none of us was
guilty of what happened and that
if we were guilty we’d already
suffered enough punishment Do you
know what Antia answered

Julieta shakes her head
AVA
(Short of breath) That we all get
what we deserve
MADRID 19 FERNANDO VI HOUSE 3 INT NIGHT
2016 SUMMER
Julieta is writing in her notebook On the table she

has the reconstructed photo with Antia and the pop-up
card with the vase of flowers that she sent her on her
19° birthday to remind her that she was alive In her
new life these are the only two physical reminders of
her daughter

JULIETA (OFF)

I raised you in the same freedom
as my parents had raised me When
we moved to Madrid and I fell into
that depression I never told you
but I was suffocated by a
tremendous sense of guilt about
your father’s death and that of
the man on the train I always
avoided talking about it I wanted
you to grow up free of guilt But
you sensed it and despite my
silence I ended up infecting you
like a virus

She looks at the open window a slight breeze moves the
white net curtain For a moment she sees the window and
invitation to the void

148 A CEMETERY EXT DAY
2007 FALL

At the door of the chapel The non-believers (or simply
smokers) are gathered outside the door of the chapel
forming little groups Lorenzo is with three men He
sees Julieta a few yards away out of place with black
glasses her hair tied back and a black overcoat in the
form of a cape On both sides of the chapel there are
only graves It is a beautiful sunny fall day Julieta
brings to mind that kind of emancipated sorrowful
attractive woman played so well by Gena Rowlands
directed by John Cassavettes in the 60s

Lorenzo walks over to her And he introduces himself

LORENZO
We saw each other in the hospital
elevator

Julieta looks at him closely but doesn’t remember him

LORENZO
I thought to myself that woman is
so pretty and so downhearted She
must be coming to see someone who

is very ill I never imagined that
it was our beloved Ava

MADRID JULIETA’S HOUSE 2 INT EVENING OR NIGHT

2007 FALL

In this period Julieta is forty eight Lorenzo a
little older but he wears it well

They drink a toast in memory of Ava in front of the
sculpture of the seated man

In a house radically lacking in adornments the
sculpture takes on a special importance

JULIETA (OFF)

Ava bequeathed me Lorenzo I never
told him about you There wasn’t a
single trace of you in the house
you didn’t exist I started a new
life with him The days became
weeks and the weeks months and
years There were days I didn’t
think about you

2016 SUMMER

Julieta in the present is still writing to her
daughter She is thinner weaker more unstable Her
skin has lost its glow compared to the previous
sequences which illustrate her life with Lorenzo six
years before

JULIETA (OFF)
When an ex-drug addict no matter
how many years he’s been clean
relapses just once that relapse
is fatal (She sighs) I abstained
from you for years but I made the
mistake of relapsing into the hope
of finding you or hearing about
you That absurd hope has devoured
the fragile basis on which I had

built my new life I’ve got
nothing left now Only you exist
Your absence fills my life

completely and is destroying it

Julieta comes out of the building and walks along

MADRID NEIGHBORHOOD BASKETBALL COURT EXT DAY
2016 FALL

Sitting on a bench inside the basketball court at one
side in the open air Julieta imagines she’s seeing
her daughter when she played there Two little girls
come into her field of vision playing and throwing the
ball at the basket If it’s a hallucination Julieta
gives herself up to it
Across from Julieta on the other side of the court
Beatriz is sitting on another bench She is checking
her mail on an iPad Neither sees the other at first
Julieta is concentrating on the girls’ game and Beatriz
is reading and answering her messages

Beatriz looks up to check on the girls and that is when
she sees Julieta in the background She waves to her
surprised by the encounter

BEATRIZ
Julieta

Julieta is still distracted by the children Beatriz
crosses the court and repeats her name Julieta sees
her approaching she looks at her as if she were a
ghost she doesn’t react

BEATRIZ
Julieta It’s me Bea

JULIETA
(Getting up as if out of it)
Beatriz Is it really you

BEATRIZ
(Alarmed) Of course Are you all
right Julieta

Julieta hugs Beatriz and bursts into tears Beatriz
keeps her arms around her and waits until she gets it
all out

BEATRIZ
There there and you were so well
when I saw you

They separate slowly

JULIETA
(Exhausted and tearful) Those two
little girls reminded me of you
and Antia

BEATRIZ
They’re my nieces But what’s
happened to you The last time I
saw you you looked so well
They sit together on the bench where Julieta had been
Julieta gradually calms down

JULIETA
When we met I didn’t say
anything but I haven’t seen
Antia or heard anything about
her for twelve years

BEATRIZ
Twelve years

She nods She pauses

JULIETA
Did you really meet her like you
told me

BEATRIZ

Yes I met her and it was very
unpleasant I didn’t tell you
that

JULIETA
(Puzzled) Unpleasant Why

BEATRIZ
Antia didn’t want to talk to me
she did everything she could to
avoid me She said she didn’t know
me that I’d mistaken her for
someone else But I knew it was
her In the end she had no choice
but to talk to me

JULIETA
Is it true about the children She
has children

BEATRIZ
Yes three When I saw her she had

two of them with her

Julieta listens closely disconcerted

JULIETA
But why didn’t she want to talk to
you You were her best friend

Asserting her status
Julieta looks at her

her

But Julieta isn’t sure she understands her

BEATRIZ

We were more than that Julieta

confused Has she

BEATRIZ
After the camp we were
inseparable Don’t you remember

JULIETA
(Hesitating) Yes of course
were always together

you

misunderstood

And Beatriz

doesn’t want to be left alone with her memories of
There’s no one better to share them with than

Antia
Julieta
BEATRIZ
We couldn’t live without each
other It’s a pity that at the end
it was hell
JULIETA
Hell
BEATRIZ
(Almost a reproach) I see you
don’t know anything
JULIETA
(Admitting) No I don’t know
anything
BEATRIZ

Julieta is trying to process all this information
wanders among all the details
her daughter was
when she went away

I decided to go and study Design
in New York to get away from her
I didn’t give her my address but I
called her and that was when Antia
told me she’d decided to go away

to a retreat in the Pyrenees I
just wanted her to leave me in
peace

suffering from a

difficult girl

She

She never imagined that
romantic break-up
She doesn’t even remember her as a
JULIETA
And did you speak again Were you
in touch

BEATRIZ
Well she called me once but she
was already a different person

JULIETA
In what way

BEATRIZ

She told me that she regretted our
relationship and was ashamed of
it And she didn’t want to know
anything about me She said that
she was a new person that she’d
finally found her path and I
wasn’t part of it She sounded
like a fanatic Julieta She
scared me

Julieta is walking along under the weight of Bea’s
confession Her lips are moving as if she were talking
to an invisible Antia She bumps into people We see
her from the point of view of someone watching from the
opposite sidewalk

Like a zombie she comes to a pedestrian crossing She
doesn’t look at the red light She thinks she sees
Lorenzo on the opposite sidewalk appearing and
disappearing among the people And she starts to cross
A car almost runs her down the driver manages to avoid
her in time only grazing her but it’s enough to knock
her to the ground

INT

2016 FALL

Lorenzo has got Julieta’s keys in his hand He opens
the door

He finds a letter lying on the floor He picks it up
and takes it with him He just looks at the address
it’s for Julieta It doesn’t look like advertising
It’s hand written It’s Antia’s writing but Lorenzo
doesn’t recognize it There’s a return address a town
in Switzerland

In the bedroom he fills one of Julieta’s bags with
clothes the most essential things He doesn’t know the
apartment but he knows her belongings He is amazed by
the bareness of the place there are no decorative
items except for Ava’s omnipresent sculpture

On the desk he finds the notebooks which Julieta has
written to Antia Lorenzo looks at them paralyzed
because he senses that their pages uncover the enigma
surrounding Julieta The last notebook is still open at
the latest notes He closes it He avoids the
temptation of reading those lines still fresh

He sees the reconstructed photo of Julieta and Antia on
the table
He also discovers a photo of the two of them Julieta
and Lorenzo on one of their trips For Lorenzo the
sight of this photo framed and resting on the desk is
vital It shows him that he isn’t out of Julieta’s
life

161 HOSPITAL INT DAY
2016 FALL

The bag with Julieta’s belongings is lying open on the
bed Lorenzo is sitting on the only chair reading a
newspaper

Julieta comes out of the bathroom She looks better
although she’s still convalescing She still has the
sensation that her body doesn’t belong to her She is
an expert in that sensation

Julieta is wearing a bathrobe She looks in the bag for
something and takes out the plastic toilet bag She
sees the notebooks at the bottom She takes them out
and looks at them for a moment

JULIETA
Have you read them

LORENZO
Nooo I didn’t have time and
anyway I wouldn’t have dared

JULIETA
Read them if you want and then
destroy them

Julieta looks into the bottom of the bag again she
glimpses a letter at the bottom She puts her hand in
and pulls it out When she sees her address her heart
leaps She recognizes Antia’s handwriting immediately
Trembling she turns the letter over to see if it has a
return address This time it does this time she finds
her daughter’s name and her address in Switzerland

2016 FALL

Lorenzo is driving the car Julieta is next to him The
trees lining the road are reflected on and invade the
windscreen Lorenzo and Julieta are pensive and silent
We hear the contents of Antia’s letter Antia’s words
acquire great presence as if she were in the back seat
saying the contents of the letter aloud

ANTIA (OFF)

Dear mom I don’t know if you’re
still in Madrid or if you’re
living in the same house but I
have no other address to write to
you I have three children Xoan
the eldest was only nine when he
drowned in a river And I am
insane with grief In these
moments the worst of my whole
life I’m thinking of you Now I
understand what you must have
suffered when I disappeared I
couldn’t imagine it Unless you’ve
suffered it you can’t imagine it

JULIETA
I’m not going to ask her for an
explanation I just want to be
with her but she didn’t invite me
to visit her

LORENZO
After thirteen years she didn’t
dare but she put her’ return
address

The car is driving through an idyllic Swiss valley A
road sign says that they are on the road to Sonogno and
that the car can’t go over 50 kilometers per hour
Julieta isn’t in a hurry and the views through the car
window are so beautiful
