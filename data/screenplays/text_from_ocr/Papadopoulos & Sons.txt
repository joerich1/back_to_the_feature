profit and the people who work there
are happy

INT MORTIMER ROLF and JONES - BOARD ROOM DAY 10 48

SOPHIE ROB HARRY and LARS - a Scandinavian banker
sitting round the boardroom table

ROB
With the help of Lars and the Norske
Velconan Bank we aim to buy Pap and
Sons back from the receivers

LARS
Also I have to say Harry that I
believe there is an intuitive bond
between the Greek and the Nordic
peoples yah And so maybe the very
first vikings were descended from
Ancient Greeks somewhere in the deep
mists of time And so its so so
Wagnerian yah

SOPHIE
We should point out the new approach

ROB
To buy Papadopoulos and Sons but divest
the food manufacturing side of the
business

HARRY
Divest the food manufacturing What
else is there

ROB
Sell off the food but keep the
property

LARS

Papadopoulos Plaza Its going to be
worth a fortune

HARRY
Thats not what I had in mind

SOPHIE
ts an asset breakup

LARS
Tusk Tusk yah Makes us sound like
barbarians

fq

- are

ROB
With the new loan youd buy back your
old assets and then sell off the
brands in the Pap and Sons stable

LARS
Yah And you know how to squeeze the
value Harry

SOPHIE
Thats a break up

HARRY
Please I know what it is

LARS
The pitta bread the cakes get sold to
a bakery

ROB
The halloumi and feta to a dairy
company

LARS

love your halloumi Grilled Its
(Kisses air) 48

ROB
The sell off value of these brands
will exceed the new loan

LARS
So my bank will get its money back
faster than you can say ‘knife’

HARRY
And what do you get

ROB
Lars wants 50 of the Plaza
development Which is what will remain
after the debts have been settled

HARRY
So you get 50 of the development for
free

LARS
Sure yeah But you get 50 of the
same development yah also for
free

SOPHIE
What do you want Harry

HARRY
I want my food business back

ROB
Guy guys guys Reality check Harry
Its not going to happen Okay The
best you can hope for is to work with
Lars here and save something
HARRY
I cant say no

LARS
Okay So Yah I need to take this to
the board Take two three months But
pish yah

SOPHIE
It seems criminal to buy the business
back only to break it up

As an aside to SOPHIE

ROB
Can I just point out that you are
skating Figuratively speaking On
thin fucking ice

HARRY

Harry (Beat) What are your fears

HARRY
My fears Oh Just that it just wont

SOPHIE
No Hang on a second (They stop)
Fish and chips is a British
classic Its much more than just a
quick meaningless experience Its
something to be savoured Just
think of the soft white cod

flakes gently falling away as your
fork pierces the hard crunchy
shell of the golden batter The
rich smells of a fryers delight
The tangy smack of salt and vinegar
on your lips Hell yeah Id pay

for that
