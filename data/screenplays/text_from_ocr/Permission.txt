INT DIANA AND JAMES BEDROOM - DAY

DIANA -- 35 pretty in a J Crew way and her husband JAMES
37 handsome but looking a bit suburban -- finish a round of
sex breathless As they lie next to each other --

DIANA
What time are we supposed to be
there

JAMES
Seven Should we go for a run
first

DIANA

(sighing)

Ill hate myself for the rest of
the day if we dont

She gets up and puts on her running clothes No pretense of
cuddling whatsoever Theres no need James heads into the
bathroom

DIANA
(continuing)

DIANA
Shit did you call the kennel

JAMES (0S)
I forgot

She walks into the bathroom --
INT BATHROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Grabbing a scrunchy and putting her hair up as as she frowns
at the box of Preparation H on the counter

DIANA
Do you really need to leave this
out for me to see I dont like
being confronted with evidence of
your inflamed asshole every time
I walk into the bathroom

JAMES
How is that any different than
your tampon boxes
DIANA
Because thats a natural function

JAMES
So my ass pain is a character flaw

DIANA
Just put it back in the medicine
cabinet when youre done Please
She walks out as James puts it away

EXT DENVER STREET - DAY

Diana and James jog bundled up in the cold March air
day old snow on the ground

JAMES
If we run eight miles a day and
fifteen on weekends we should be
able to finish without
embarrassing ourselves too badly

DIANA
Maybe we should just do the half-
marathon

JAMES

We could just do the 5K --
Diana frowns

DIANA
Old people do 5Ks Im not old yet

She picks up her pace and passes him smacking his ass

EXTINT JAMES AND DIANAS HOUSE - DAY - LATER
James and Diana enter their house tired and sweaty

DIANA
What do you mean we need a new
retaining wall

JAMES
What else could that statement
possibly mean

DIANA
Now

Three-
JAMES
We could wait until the house
slides down the hill but now
would probably be better

DIANA
(sighing)

Were never spending a month in
Tuscany are we

JAMES
Not this month --

Their dog Daisy a black Lab is waiting for them James
grabs her leash from a hook

JAMES
(continuing)
Ill take Daisy for a spin while
you make the salad

DIANA
Why does Joanne always ask me to
make salad I can make something

else
JAMES
Like what
DIANA
I dont know -- something

different A baguette Some brie

JAMES
Thats not making thats buying
and unwrapping Besides I like
your salad

He kisses her on the cheek and heads out the door with Daisy
Diana looks into the fridge uninspired

INT BATHROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

On the way to her shower Diana picks up James boxers and a
pair of his dirty socks from the floor throwing them into
the hamper Annoyed

She turns on the water and looks at her naked profile in the
full length mirror sighing

DIANA
Fucking gravity
INT BOB AND JOANNAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Diana and James walk in shaking off the snow Salad and a
bottle of wine in hand JOANNA mid 30s cute and very
pregnant and BOB mid 30s ex-frat boy with a receding
hairline relieve them of their burdens

BOB
Jimmy D You ready for the slopes

JAMES
Seven more days --

JOANNA
No talking about ski trips in
front of the pregnant wife please

BOB

you go even if you were skinny

JOANNA

child

She turns to Diana handing her a glass of wine

JOANNA
(continuing)
So Elaines bringing her new
guy tonight

DIANA
(intrigued)

BOB
(scoffing)
First guy after the divorce
Disposable

SARAH mid 30s gorgeous and bullet-proof walks in through
the back door carrying a bowl of guacamole

SARAH
So weve already decided we dont
like him

Joanna takes the bowl from her

JOANNA
We dont know if we like him We
havent met him yet But we hear
hes cute
BOB
Oh do we Then Im sold As
long as hes cute

SARAH
I hear hes hung like French bread

DIANA
(surprised)
Theyre already having sex

SARAH
Of course theyre having sex What
would be the point of not having
sex

JAMES
Speaking of which no date tonight

SARAH
No one worth subjecting you all
to Hes coming over when I get

home
JAMES
I take it hes not good at making
conversation
SARAH
Not unless you like talking about
his abs
The front door opens and ELAINE -- late 30s pretty but with

a recently-shattered-and-trying-to-rebuild quality and STEVE
30s and clean-cut -- walk in

ELAINE
Okay everyone has to stop talking
about me now Im here

She hands Joanna a pie

JOANNA
Damn we were just getting to the
good stuff
ELAINE
(re Steve)

This is Steve I met him at a
Broncos game weve been dating

JAMES
Is there a history of smallpox in
your family

BOB
Ever shot a bear

SARAH
Does it hang past your knee

Steve looks a bit frightened

JOANNA
(to Steve)
Let me get you a drink Its
gonna be a long night

INT BOB AND JOANNAS KITCHEN - LATER

The men are now off in the living room as the women
congregate in the kitchen watching Joanna cook as they
decimate a couple bottles of wine

DIANA
(eager to Elaine)
So whats it like having sex
with someone new I cant even
imagine it so describe it well

ELAINE
Its good Really good He
doesnt act bored Makes a huge
difference

She samples some of Sarahs guacamole spilling a glop in her
cleavage then uses a chip to retrieve it

DIANA
So its not weird at all

ELAINE
Why would it be weird

DIANA
I dont know -- after fifteen
years of sex with just James Id
be worried therere new tricks I
dont know about

SARAH
There are We all do it in
different holes now
JOANNA
Its not like Steves a different
species--

SARAH

I beg to differ Jim was a
walking piece of shit

ELAINE
Honestly The thrill of someone
new got me more excited than the
actual sex itself Id forgotten
how fun it is to see someone naked
for the first time

JOANNA
(agreeing)
I walked in on Bobs cousin
getting out of the shower once
Thought about it for months
Youdve thought Id never seen a
penis before

INT BOB AND JOANNAS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The guys sit on the couches with their beers

BOB
(to Steve)
So -- you and Elaine
STEVE
Yeah

JAMES

Hows the Audi in the snow

STEVE
Good Kick ass cornering

BOB
Sweet

INT BOB AND JOANNAS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - SAME
The women continue their far more interesting conversation
SARAH
(to Elaine)

How many guys were you with before
you were married
ELAINE
Eighteen Somewhere around there
JOANNA
(kidding)
Slut
SARAH

Oh please Sixty-three Sixty-
four once I get home tonight

JOANNA
I guess I was close to thirty when
I met Bob

They all look at Diana

DIANA
(chagrined)
Four Including James

SARAH

Well thats what happens when you
meet the love of your life in
college You miss out on a lot of
bad one night stands and sex on
the hood of a car after the White
Stripes show While the motor was
running thank you very much

DIANA
I know Im not complaining

JOANNA
Yes you are

ELAINE
It was a disgruntled sigh at the
very least --

DIANA
Its just sometimes I wish there
had been a voice that told me In
one week youll meet the man
youll spend the rest of your life
with so screw everyone you can in
the next seven days

ELAINE
And whose voice would this be
The patron saint of whores
SARAH
Maybe thats my problem I keep
hearing the voice but the husband
part never comes through I have
a shitty saint

JOANNA
(to Diana)
Speaking of which what are you
gonna be doing at Club Med while
this one screws everything that
walks

SARAH
Youre presuming Ill limit myself
to the ambulatory

DIANA
Scuba diving I havent done it
in years I used to love it

ELAINE
Ugh Too much trouble Screwing
sounds like more fun

James pokes his head in the door

JAMES
Are we ever going to eat or are
you guys gonna talk about Steves
penis all night

JOANNA
We stopped talking about Steves
penis a long time ago Now were
talking about yours

JAMES
Then by all means continue It
does tricks
(to Diana)
Tell them

He leaves Elaine looks at Diana

ELAINE
Anything other than the basic Up
Down and Play Dead

SARAH
You know what trick Id love to
see A penis that can have an
orgasm without ejaculating

SARAH (contd)
I dont know why were expected to
use our internal organs to sop up
their wad

The other women groan Diana carries a stack of plates into
the dining room

DIANA
Lets bring that up over dinner

INT JAMES AND DIANAS JEEP - NIGHT - LATER

James is at the wheel as they pull out of Bob and Joannas
driveway

JAMES
He seemed okay Not a Mensa
candidate by any means but at
least he wasnt offensively stupid
like some of the guys Sarah brings

around

DIANA
Sarah goes for quantity not
quality

JAMES

You say that like its something
to be proud of

DIANA
No Im just saying it

She stares out the window as they sit at a red light

DIANAS POV A YOUNG COUPLE is passionately making out in the
Applebees parking lot The guy has his hands on the girls
ass

DIANA
(continuing)
Thats what we were talking about
in the kitchen Our numbers Mine
was the lowest

James looks at her

JAMES
You sound disappointed

DIANA
Uh no youre projecting

JAMES
How am I projecting

DIANA
Youre not upset that you didnt
sleep with more women

JAMES
So youre upset about not
sleeping with more guys

Diana sighs and stares out the window at the dirty snow

DIANA
Why do you pick fights with me
over nothing

JAMES
Your disappointment at not having
banged half the city is nothing

DIANA
Pull over

JAMES
Why

DIANA

Just pull over
He does Diana straddles him kissing him

DIANA
(continuing)
I love you you know

JAMES
I love you too

She kisses him again pushing the button that leans his seat
back and unzipping his pants

JAMES
(continuing)
Twice in one day Not bad for an
old married couple

DIANA
Whore you calling old
(then)
Is it too cold to do it on the
hood

INT DIANAS OFFICE - DAY

Diana sits at her desk on the phone The Rocky Mountains are
framed in the window behind her

Her phone pitch is less than enthusiastic

DIANA

(into phone)
I think the Vegan Food Council
would make a fantastic cover
story no sure I realize
theyre not exactly sexy but a
lot of sexy people are vegans
okay well how bout I send you
the press kit in case you change
your mind No actually I
dont like to waste trees

She hangs up and looks at her co-worker ERIC 30s handsome
before God took all of his hair something hes clearly
pissed about He stands in her doorway

DIANA
(continuing)
I am the worlds worst publicist

ERIC
Agreed

He cocks his head toward the receptionist Diana can see her
through her glass wall

ERIC
(continuing)
What the hell is Bridgette
wearing Does she not have a
mirror or is it trendy to look
like a whore

Diana looks out at BRIDGETTE 20s who does indeed look like
a streetwalker on her way home from a gang bang

DIANA
Who do you have coming in today

ERIC
Ah Thats it Shortstop for the
Rockies He showed her the
ceiling of the dugout once

He raises his eyebrows to infer sex in case Diana is too
dim to get the reference

DIANA
Isnt he married

ERIC
Yep He has an arrangement

DIANA
Im guessing thats a code word
for stupid wife

ERIC
Im guessing we shouldnt let our
staff have sex with our clients
How was your weekend

DIANA
The usual Yours

ERIC
Went to a bar talked to some
girls who wouldnt even pretend to
be interested in me then went
home and contemplated adopting a
kid on my own

DIANA
Thats a terrible idea And I say
that only because I know youre a
complete imbecile

Through the glass wall they see the HOT SHORTSTOP walk into
the lobby Bridgette does her best hair toss and tits-out
pose

ERIC
Yep its on

As Eric goes out to greet him --

ERIC
(continuing to Diana)
By the way has Sarah decided she
loves me yet

DIANA
On the very slim and non-existent
chance that that ever happens
youll be the first to know

As Eric walks out the Hot Shortstop catches sight of Diana
through the glass wall He winks at her giving her a love-to-
fuck-you-baby look

Diana blushes then quickly looks down at her desk After he
passes by -- she lets herself look up again and smiles
Shes still got it

EXT DENVER STREET - NIGHT

Diana and James run around Washington Park Not bothering to
make conversation the way married people often dont

Coming from the other direction is the Denver University male
and female TRACK TEAMS -- young athletic gorgeous Diana
and James shrink a bit in comparison

As they pass both Diana and James turn to check them out
A bit wistful

INT DIANA AND JAMES KITCHEN - NIGHT

Still in their running clothes Diana and James make dinner
She fixes salad he prepares some chicken for the grill

DIANA
Who was the last girl you slept
with Before me Was it Margie

James thinks for a moment

JAMES
Fiona She was a Sigma Kappa

DIANA
You dont even remember her last
name

JAMES
Why

DIANA

I dont know its just at the

time Im sure you never thought
it would be the last time youd
sleep with someone Other than
me Thats kinda weird when you
think about it I never thought
Zach Ferguson was gonna be mine

JAMES
I definitely wouldve gone for
someone sluttier if Id known
Fiona apologized to Jesus
afterwards Kinda killed the
mood

DIANA
Who would you sleep with now If
I gave you permission

James bends down to fill Daisys bowl with food

JAMES
The biker chick we saw at Costco
‘ve never been close to that much
armpit hair

DIANA
m serious

JAMES
(frowning)
dont know

DIANA
Sure you do

JAMES
What like youre going to give me
permission all of a sudden so I
better have a list of names ready

DIANA
No I was just wondering

JAMES
Dont forget to call the septic
tank guy Our yard is a swamp

He walks out to the grill with the chicken as Diana marvels
at how he just went from sex to sewage

INT JAMES AND DIANAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Diana and James read All of a sudden she puts her book
down and looks at him

DIANA
What if I did give you permission

JAMES
Permission to what

DIANA
To have sex with another woman

James looks at her confused

JAMES
And why would you do this
She reaches over and turns off the light
in the dark eyes open freaked out

DIANA
We could both have permission
You could sleep with another woman
and I could sleep with another
guy While were on vacation

James stares at her incredulous and angry

JAMES
Youre serious

DIANA
Its not like wed be cheating
because wed have permission And
it would just be this once Wed
never even talk about it
afterwards Nothing in our lives
would change

James tries to process this

JAMES
Youre telling me youd really be
okay with me sleeping with another
woman --

DIANA
Only if I never had to hear about
it Ever We come home and
everything is the same as always
We just act like nothing happened

James mulls this over still in disbelief that she

JAMES
You seriously want to do this
DIANA
Dont you
JAMES
Well -- yeah but I dont want you
to
DIANA

Just think about it We can
decide tomorrow night

suggested

James lies there

EXT DENVER STREET - DAY

James drives to work stopping at a crosswalk to let the
Denver University GIRLS TRACK TEAM pass by

He watches them with new interest
INT JAMES OFFICE - DAY

Bob is at his computer simultaneously writing Unix code and
watching streaming porn in the corner of his screen Two
girls are enjoying a banana in an orifice it wasnt meant for

James walks up

JAMES
Ive got something I need to run
by you

Bob looks up

BOB
Whats up

JAMES
(voice lowered)
Diana is going to let me sleep
with another woman While were on
our ski trip

BOB
(confused)
Youre gonna ask her for this
Because Im pretty sure she wont
go for it

JAMES
No she asked me It was her idea

Now Bob is even more confused

BOB
It was her idea for you to sleep
with another woman

JAMES
Yeah

BOB
(in awe)
I always thought your wife was
cool but this is un-fucking-
precedented

James looks around making sure no one else is in earshot

JAMES
Well she gets to sleep with
another guy so its not totally
for my benefit

Bob frowns

BOB
Youre letting some other guy plow
your wife

JAMES
You were all over this idea a
second ago --

BOB
Dont get me wrong -- Im still
all over it Im just pointing
out that the deal got a little
less sweet But its still a
goddamn tangerine

JAMES
Am I crazy to consider this

BOB
Youd be crazy if you didnt
Youve got permission

JAMES
But am I crazy to let her sleep
with another guy

Bob thinks about it for a second then shrugs

BOB
As long as you dont know him and
you dont have to see him around
town

JAMES
Shes gonna do it in the
Caribbean While were skiing

Bob lets out a whats-the-problem snort

BOB
Then youre golden Youll never
see the guy so you wont even
think about it

BOB (contd)
I mean you might once or twice
but then you can start thinking
about the girl you banged and it
wont seem so bad

James takes this in

BOB
(continuing)
How do I get Joanna to sign on to
this Can Diana call her

JAMES
Do me a favor and dont say
anything to her I dont want
anyone else to know

BOB
Good point Shed just talk her
out of it

LISA a pretty co-worker walks by

BOB
(continuing)
Hey Lisa You gonna be in Aspen
this weekend by any chance

James gives him a look

BOB
(continuing)
What Its an innocent question

James walks off pointing at Bobs computer screen

JAMES
That bananas gonna give them an
infection

INT WINE BAR - DUSK

Diana sits at the bar glass of wine in front of her Face
creased with worry Sarah enters and pulls off her coat

SARAH
I hope you realize I was in the
middle of writing a very important
article on campaign finance
reform Im pretty sure its the
newspaper equivalent to Ambien
Especially if I keep using words
like fiscal malfeasance

Diana checks out her suede mini-skirt and thigh-high boots

DIANA
You wore that to work
SARAH
No I keep back-up bar clothes in
the office So -- what happened
DIANA

Nothing happened Yet

SARAH
Fuck Youre having a baby

DIANA
No God no

Sarah sighs relieved

SARAH
Dont scare me like that Its
bad enough that youre married
(off Dianas look)
You know what I mean So --
whats this thing thats going to
happen

DIANA
I told James I want to sleep with
another guy While were on
vacation And that Id let him
sleep with another woman

Sarah stares at her for a moment and then bursts out laughing

SARAH
WHAT

DIANA
I know It was idiotic And now
I have to figure out how to take
it back

SARAH

Back up -- this is very un-Diana
Where the hell did this come from

Diana sighs
Now Sarah

DIANA

When I was listening to you guys
the other night it hit me that I
never did the things you do And
the things Elaine gets to do now
And I never will Every day of my
life will be exactly the same for
the next fifty years

SARAH
First of all you would never do
half the things I do --

DIANA
You know what I mean I just
feel like I missed out I never
had a one night stand The three
guys I slept with before James
were all boyfriends I never had
cheap smutty sex with someone and
Ive always wondered what its

like

SARAH
Its pretty damn good but Im
confused -- you always said you

were happy with your sex life

DIANA
I am Its just -- I cant
remember the last time I was
excited to have sex with James
That doesnt mean I dont like it
when we do it I do most of the
time its just hard to get
excited about something you can
have whenever you want Theres no
anticipation And Im fine with
that Usually I just thought
why not try it this one time But
its insane right Theres no
way we can do this

is appalled

SARAH
Are you kidding me You get to
fuck a stranger This is genius

DIANA
(encouraged)
Really

SARAH
Why didnt you think of this
before
DIANA
(worried again)
But what if James likes it -- the
other girl -- too much What if
he wants to keep doing it
SARAH
(placating)

Dont worry about James He loves

you Its not like hell start an

affair Hell just screw some slut
in Aspen and be done with it

DIANA
So you dont think this is a
terrible awful idea

SARAH
Im telling you -- every married
couple should do it Variety is
the spice of a happy snatch

DIANA
What if shes prettier than I am
The girl he picks And what if he
thinks about her every time we
have sex for the rest of our
lives Wishing I was her

Sarah waves a hand dismissing the thought

SARAH
Never happen
(then)
But if it did -- that would suck

INT DIANAS CAR - NIGHT

Diana stops at a red light next to a bus with a VICTORIAS

Diana glares at it then floors the gas when the light turns
green

INT JAMES AND DIANAS HOUSE - NIGHT
James is in front of the TV watching an equally salacious

Victorias Secret commercial more interested than he would

DIANA
We shouldnt do this

He looks at her

JAMES

(slight
disappointment)
You changed your mind

DIANA
What Now you want to do it
JAMES
Yeah I think it could be good for
us
DIANA
(worried)
You do
JAMES
This was your idea -- why am I

convincing you
She gets defensive

DIANA
Youre not

JAMES
You obviously feel like this is
something you need to do so --

Diana tries to figure out how to unhoist herself from her own
pitard She cant

DIANA
Fine Well do it then

She heads into the kitchen and starts loading the dishes into
the dishwasher James follows her

INT JAMES AND DIANAS KITCHEN - NIGHT
Diana slams plates into the rack

JAMES

genius

JAMES

DIANA
Why whatd Bob say

He cant believe Im letting
another guy plow my wife but he
likes my end of the deal

He comes up behind her and hugs her moving his hands up to
her boobs

JAMES
(continuing re the
dishes)

Do this later

Diana turns to look at him upset

DIANA
Are you horny right now because

JAMES
(oh shit)
No -- Im horny right now because
Im with my hot wife and I want to
screw her

DIANA

JAMES
You have no idea how good you look

silverware in the dishwasher Its
better than any stripper on a pole

He starts to lift her shirt She warms to him

DIANA
You are so full of shit

He kisses her
DIANA
(continuing worried)
Everything is going to be fine
after this right

JAMES
Of course it is

DIANA
You wont think about it
afterwards When youre with me

He frowns

JAMES
Why would I think about another
woman when Im with you

She gives him an oh please look

JAMES
(continuing)
Okay Michelle Pheiffer in
Scarface a couple times but
only when Im tired And I know
you think about that guy from
Lost so Im not gonna feel bad

DIANA
Im serious --
JAMES
Look -- the way I see it is we

happier than ever about what weve
got Trust me Ive thought it
through

DIANA

and both come back laughing about
how bad it was

Diana smiles

DIANA

DIANA
Cant you wait until were on the

SARAH

Oh come on Its not like he

James walks out and hands Diana her carry-on bag He eyes
Sarah in the car looking like she cant wait to indoctrinate
Diana into the world of sluthood

SARAH
(continuing)
Hi James dont worry Ill
take good care of her

JAMES
I think Id be more comfortable if
you were going with Joanna

She gives him a hug

DIANA
I love you

JAMES

DIANA

EXT CARIBBEAN AIRPORT - DAY
A plane lands
EXT CLUB MED BEACH BAR - DUSK

A thatch-roof palapa on a white sand beach A couple dozen
people down drinks and eye each other trying to figure out
who theyre going to fuck

Diana and Sarah walk up to the bar each dressed in sexy
outfits Theyre greeted by JOEL a 40ish spindly geek with
his shirt unbuttoned to his navel

JOEL
Ladies Welcome Im Joel I like
to consider myself the welcome
wagon

Sarah rolls her eyes but Diana humors him He seems harmless
enough

DIANA
Well then you must know what
drink we should order

JOEL
Try the Yellow Bird Benjyll fix
it right up for you

He cocks his head toward the mid-20s shaggy-haired
bartender BENJY nods and gets to work

SARAH
(eyeing the crowd)
So tell us Joel who are the
guys to stay away from this week

Joel wrinkles his brow and gives this some thought

JOEL
Id steer clear of Paul

He points to a cocky-looking broad-shouldered guy with a
swagger

JOEL
(continuing)
Hes a bit of a ladies man

SARAH
Are we talking one a night or is
he doubling up

JOEL
I believe theres been some nights
where hes gone north of two

Diana makes a face Benjy sets their Yellow Birds down in
front of them

BENJY
Welcome ladies Be careful with
Joel Hes been known to steal a
few hearts around here Including
mine

He gives Joel a wink Joel blushes

JOEL
Dont listen to him

Sarah raises her glass

SARAH
To a week of debauchery

She clinks against Dianas and turns to Joel

SARAH
(continuing)
Diana gets to cheat on her husband
this week

Diana nearly chokes on her drink

DIANA
(sotto)
Thats not really the kind of
thing I want to announce

SARAH
Why not Joel wont think any less
of you will you Joel

JOEL
Not at all in fact I think there
are a few other ladies here doing
the same thing

SARAH
But I bet they dont have
permission Her husband knows
about it so technically I guess
its not cheating

Joel gives Diana his best smolder
JOEL
Well if youd like to get it out
of the way tonight Id be happy
to offer my services

DIANA
I appreciate that Joel but Im
going to have to decline
(to Sarah)
Lets take a walk

She grabs her and drags her out to the beach
EXT BEACH - DUSK - CONTINUOUS
The sun sets behind a stunning turquoise sea

DIANA
We have to get our story straight

SARAH
What story

DIANA
Exactly There is no story Were
just two friends here to lay on
the beach Dont tell anyone else
about my arrangement

SARAH
Oh come on Its hysterical
And genius as Ive already pointed
out

DIANA
I really dont think hysterical
genius is the vibe I want to be
putting out this week

SARAH
As long as you put out the owner
of a working vagina vibe youll
do fine Cmon --
(heading back to the
bar)
Lets go sample the cocktails

Diana takes a deep breath and follows Sarah
EXT ASPEN - DUSK

Skiiers leave Ajax mountain as the sun begins to set

INT LITTLE NELL BAR - DUSK

twenty dollar martinis Lots of pretty gold-digging women

James and Bob are at the bar

JAMES
Im never going to get laid here
These women are after money

BOB
So lie Say youre a rap mogul or
something

JAMES
(skeptical)
Im wearing corduroys

Bob spots a girl by the fireplace A cute redhead who
doesnt look quite as cash-hungry as the rest of the women

BOB
What about that one

JAMES
Shes cute --

BOB
he may not be slutty enough but
its worth a shot Lets go

n

JAMES
Shouldnt you stay here

BOB
You really think you can pull this
off without a wingman Youre
fifteen years outta practice

James cant help but agree so he lets Bob escort him over to
the redhead OLIVIA at the fireplace

JAMES
Mind if we join you in front of
the fire

OLIVIA

BENJY

DIANA
It was supposed to be this fun
meaningless thing My husband

actually gave me permission

BENJY
Maybe you didnt really want to do
it after all

DIANA
I did I really did I just
wanted to remember what it was
like Youre young you wont
understand but trust me sleep
with every girl you can now
because some day youre going to
be married and older and living in
a tiny claustrophobic house with
a useless boring job and even
though youll love your wife
youll wish you hadnt been such
a prude when you were younger

DIANA (contd)
Not that it would make any
difference in your present but at
least youd have -- I dont know
what youd have actually But
maybe it wouldnt feel so --
monotonous

Benjy just stares at her

BENJY

that prude problem

Except for the fact that Diana
fucked a bartender

DR PALUMBO
Well James I think youre
overstating the situation
considering the arrangement you
agreed to but I do agree theres

root of her desire for this
arrangement
