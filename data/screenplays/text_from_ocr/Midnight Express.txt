Bus stops suddenly BILLY changes expression
THROUGH FRONT WINDSHIELD we see TURKISH SOLDIERS in
several
HALFTRACKS drawn up in a semicircle blocking the bus
The
Pan American PLANE is directly behind Also JEEPS and a
POLICEMAN waving the bus down
BUS BOOR opens and the Turkish Police OFFICER hops
aboard
briskly

PASSENGERS A confused hum
VARIOUS PASSENGERS

The Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together
their items and beginning to exit as

POLICE OFFICER repeats in ENGLISH

POLICE OFFICER

CLOSE BILLY The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the

speechin English but already Billy realizes And its

panic Silent panic That horrendous cold feeling all

over his back Oh God what have I done what can I do
now

He freezes

MOVE TO SUSAN rising fetching her things irritated

SUSAN
Jesus they do everything ass
backwards in Turkey

Behind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS
beginning

to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped

conversations expletives including

PASSENGERS
Theyre checking for hijackers
Any Palestinians aboard Hey Harry
get rid of your grenades

Laughter is returned from several of the American

contingent but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground

real fear in his
voice)
What is it Billy
BILLY
(a fierce whisper
panic)

His tone stuns her never before has he spoken to her

that A LOOK between them he has his glasses off now
Shes not a stupid girl by any means and realizes

is very wrong and for the both of them shed best do
exactly as he says And fast She moves OUT OF SHOT

BILLY crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast
finger shaking reaching into his sweater starting to

the bench Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers
are exiting BUT THEN

BILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into
lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection
Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area It
open vast no place to run or hide The only apparent
hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of
the passengers impatiently waiting

TWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the
body-searching the male passengers alternately

SUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away with

ATTENDANTS doing the searching She glances at Billy as

VIP ROOM AIRPORT LOUNGE The scene moves very fast
Indicating A sense of chaos Much smoke Many phone

Half A dozen Turkish police OFFICERS Are bizarrely
In A row of fold up chairs next to A desk Chattering

themselves (AD LIB) lighting their Turkish cigarettes
They hardly pay attention as

MOVE TO BILLY scared sweating - backlit by the huge
windows overlooking the airstrip In background we see
the 707 Pan American PLANE beginning to circle towards
runway GUARDS have stripped him down to his bare

and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides

him from the door

ZIAT is quickly summing up Billys character This is
craftHe is a prisoner and trustee sinister man whose
motivation in life is the accumulation of money in the
pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish SCAR
running the width of his throat various other facial
and one blind milky white EYE Hes stocky and strong -
about five ten with bushy eyebrows brown cigarette
big dirty nails repulsively in need of a bath Whats
surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old
looks and behaves like sixty The personification of
denaturalization of a man Time body mind - all of

warped

still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering

enunciating very clearly hoping he will understand

of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from
cobwebbed ceilingA DOOR opens and

HAMIDOU STEPS in lowering his head to get through the
doorChief of the guards A clean uniform Four

The only guard to carry a holstered gun very

man He is about six two two forty and muscular and
moves lightly like a fighter on his feet His skull is
bullet-shaped and completely shaven like Billys

this effect he has no eyebrows and his pale blue eyes
(suggesting a trace of Indo-European stock in his

are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes
nothing away His nose is a beak of skin his neck

his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his
feet between anger and amusement He approaches BILLY
looks into his eyes drawing out the moment for
enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others
BILLY meets his eyes respectfully then realizing this

perhaps not the thing do to looks away But

by the mans features beyond his self-control he looks
back

smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of

HAMIDOU

arm stiff out to his side

BILLY watches fascinated
HAMIDOU lets the arm linger then
SMASHES BILLY across the face with an open palm BILLY
shoots back and smashes against the wall just from the
force of one blow Stunned

thick rope tied about his ankles the legs spread -

then lowered slightly his head and backs of shoulders

fierce hawk-faced old man with a chunk of his ear

He wears a colorful flowing robe various scarves

trinkets rings baggy pants and pointed curved shoes
and makes emphatic violent gestures at ZIAT with his
mutilated THREE FINGERS ZIAT Seems to speak something

his language and bargains back

BELL
(continuous)
He was an informer on the outside
but he tried to screw the cops out
of 60 kilos of opium Watch him
hes a fox

BILLY says nothing to them about the Ziat incident

him up for himself

THE AFGHANI having concluded the deal with ZIAT reaches
deep into his layers of clothing around his crotch and

pulls out several scrofulous 10 bills which discreetly
takes in exchange for a thick wad of Turkish currency

ANOTHER ANGLE - all the color and breath seems to have
gone from BILLY

ERICH
(his English is
halting but has a
calming effect)
Dont pay too much attention

You might get bail

BELL snorts amused kicking the SOCCER BALL away hard

it dribbles towards them
ERICH
If you make bail youre free
You can get a fake passport or

The Greeks hate the Turks so much

The time has come your Honor to

ourselves isolated and morally

race

THE COURTROOM - monolithic frightening immense with

currents of greenish light from the enormous windows
People seem insignificant

THE PROSECUTOR wearing dark green glasses continues
scowling gesturing profusely at

We must alter this image by
punishing only our own drug
smugglers-but by handing out
foreigners who infest our culture
with their depravity ungodly and
behavior We must start now - by
sentencing this American Vilyum
Hi-yes to the maximum sentence
for smuggling to be held up to
the light of the world as an example
of Turkish justice and its intention
to halt the drug trade once and

for all I ask the Court therefore
to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life

BILLY rises tense

FATHER looks over at him manages a reassuring smile

JUDGE continuing after preliminaries

JUDGE
The Defendant has been found guilty
by the Court of the illegal
possession of Hashish

PROSECUTOR his expression souring makes a gesture of

defeat We wanted a conviction for smuggling not
possession

BILLY not understanding sees the Prosecutors gesture

and a hint of hope crosses his expression

JUDGE puts the paper away looks at BILLY directly

Four years two months Its good

FATHER

Four years

YESIL
(quickly)
We appeal it

BILLY watching this a lost look
FATHER is too shocked to do anything but look at YESIL
continues on

YESIL

You will see he will have maybe
one year taken off this sentence
for good behaviour Remember it
is only for possession the
prosecutor wanted life sentence
for smuggling

To be honest Mr Hayes it is a
great victory

BILLY is forcibly removed from the DOCK - in chains

paler
Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls A
PHOTO of SUSAN taken outdoors with a mountain range in

In the distance very faintly coming upwards into our
sound

consciousness we hear a TRAIN WHISTLING in the night
on

an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls Two

whistles Chugging Then passing off The Midnight
Express

BILLYS VOICE
Dear Susan 1970 has now passed
into 1971 You can drift in here
and never know youre gone You
can fade so far out and you dont
know where you are anymore or where
anything else is

The CAMERA DRIFTS around the SECOND STORY KOGUS

plays with dexterous grace BILLY is fast agile BELL
muscular intense his hits power-packed
BILLYS VOICE
(continuous)
In the daytimes we sometimes

play volleyball against the big

Turkish gangsters
THE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in
context moving like big clumsy bears waving their
and screaming at each other disorganized Ever
of fashion they have their jackets and vests off but
in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves
shiny slacks black pointed pumps The boys wear shorts
and sneakers On the sidelines we see a group of

laying bets and shouting encouragement

BILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the
TURKISH OPPONENT backs off he dinks the ball in just

the net the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him

BELL goes up for another ball close to the net and
SMASHES it with all his might and

BALL bangs right into the eye of a TURK who flails his
arms and SCREAMS with pain very theatrical
CUT

THE SAME TURK now swaggers around the COURTYARD
wearing
sunglasses so no one will see his black eye

BILLYS VOICE
To the Turks all foreigners are
ayip - unclean dirty We dont

crotch

BELL across the pointyard grins at him and points him
out

to BILLY and ERICH

BILLY VOICE

Even the yoga I sometimes do is
ayip - too suggestive

THE TURK scowls back at BELL huddles menacingly with
another TURK

BILLYS VOICE

(continuous)
And youre never supposed to eat
with your left hand You know why
Because thats what they use to
wipe their asses with instead of
toilet paper And yet they hate
pigs There are no pigs in Turkey
Theyre considered dirty

BELL smirking at the Turk turns and walks away

BILLY VOICE

(continuous)
So is homosexuality Thats a big
crime here but most of them do it
every chance they get There are
about a thousand things that are
ayip But theyre really so
hypocritical like children breaking
the rules For instance

Suddenly a CRY OFF and

THE TURK runs up pulling a sharp SHIV from his pants

using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly STABS BELL in
the ass and backs of his thighs One two three four
five QUICK STABS like a cook hammering veal In spite

its violence the action seems like slapstick
BELL tumbles to the ground crying out

THE TURK stashes the shiv and disappears among his
his honor restored

BILLY and ERICH run over to help BELL who is obviously
more in pain than in danger

BILLY VOICE
(continuous)

»You can stab or shoot some body
the but not above the waist because
thats intent to kill So everybody
runs around stabbing everyone else
in the ass Thats what they call
Turkish revenge Theres also a
lot of Baksheesh thats a favorite
Turkish word for bribery

LONG SHOT - HAMIDOU and ASLAN the young fat Turkish

pointed out previously by Erich are taking tea

HAMIDOU

They go on each protesting

Hamidou hints that he needs new
braces for one of his sons Aslan

The new American Ambassador here
is following your case very closely
He says there is progress But
there is another route that is
quite possible

(lowers his voice

and leans close)
For the proper amount of money
it is possible I can convince
certain officials to lose track of
your papers before the High Court
in Ankara confirms the sentence of
the Lower Court in Istanbul You
would not exist and you could be
in Greece by the time the Turkish
courts discovered a stupid clerical
mistakeBut I have to act before
the official sentence is handed
down and for that I must pay
certain officials in advance

hard to make enough money nights

to be the only way out of there
Except of course the other way

stabbing) are huddled around BELLs BUNK late NIGHT
candle

furtively looks around pulling out and elaborately

unfolding a set of DRAWINGS from a pack of letters

SUSANS VOICE

But I cannot say I am for it
Nor are your parents They consulted
the priest and he said to send
you money for that reason would be
like sealing your death

German cat an architect in the

funny
look on is face

MAX
Gotta be here someplace Thought
I heard a couple of dead Christians
singing down there

Stop shitting me man

BILLY

But how would you get into the

MAX
I suppose you knock three times

Hey Im getting this together

Max then back to

Billy)

his face)

out of his skull)

We go through the wall

BELL between BILLY and MAX walking in the COURTYARD
continuing intently
BELL
The Kraut was right I checked
it out - theres no reinforced
steel in those bath walls Theyre
real soft from underground seepage--

BELL reaches the wall turns around and continues
Lowers

them

BELL

years you can almost push it over
All we do is use Gastroheads

mortar out Pull out 2 3 stones

two night operation maybe three

MAX
And what do you do when you in the

BILLY

These are the spokes of the wheel

TWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint eerie

to the chamber One one side a pot-bellied stove

etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange
glow

SOME LUNATICS not walking hover around the stove

are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that
the length of two walls of these men are naked

with open running sores over their knees elbows
But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd They
are the lowest order of madmen They have no minds

They are the damned

BILLY walks among them expressionless A tall thin
cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up
alongside BILLY looks at him walks with him is about
fifty his pyjamas relatively clean looking more sane
than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and

wet hair is matted down on his head and big clumps of

AHMET doesnt wait for an answer

never let me go

BILLY pays no attention keeps shuffling on Glances
him smiles

AHMET
They wont let YOU go either

The smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord
inside Billy because Billy glances briefly at this
who is smiling Billy looks back at his feet

AHMET

No theyll never let you go

They tell you they let you go but
you stay You never go from here

BILLY plods on grins and tries to explain the
like a father lecturing a child

AHMET
You see we all come from a factory
Sometimes the factory makes bad

BILLY is led down a CORRIDOR by HAMIDOU into
A VISITING room - Cabins are lined up like narrow
phone booths

HAMIDOU
Kabin on-yedi

BILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin
the door sits in the chair No one is there He waits

indifferent to any sense of time Dirty two glass panes
separate visitor and prisoner booths bars are between

panes An erratic microphone is the method of
communication giving a weird and distant aspect to the
voice

HAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door

in unseen as

TEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in
holding a large photo album it takes several moments

her to react and then her face shows the shock

against the thin shirt

SUSAN fingers the photo album nervously speaking slow

SUSAN slowly scared begins to unbutton her shirt
HAMIDOU looks on silently does nothing

BILLY follows every movement with wild-eyed lust

SUSAN leans up close to the window With both hands on
the front of her blouse she slowly draws it apart

deep cleavage and hard dark nipples They hang full and

sputtering out in his throat then

facing him

HAMIDOU makes an elaborate gesture of putting aside his
falaka stick and holstered gun he will use his hands

HAMIDOU

Youve been in prison too long

Vilyum Hi-yes
He takes that stiff arm all the way back to its full
and WHACKS BILLY up against the wall
BILLY bounces back off the wall The print of Hamidous
fingers is imbedded like a flaring white rainbow in the
redness of his left cheek SLAM - a backhanded whack
BILLY bounces right back from the wall steadies him

the falaka stick with all his might

HAMIDOU is in contortions his nose busted and

His HAND gripping BILLY by the neck forcing him back

BILLY in the distance

ONE SOLDIER seems lighter than the others and takes off

a sprint as the OTHERS follow

THE HALFTRACK now crests the incline and gathering full
gear and momentum roars off down the slope after

CLOSE BILLY running sweat all over him In background
HALFTRACK and running FIGURES

BILLY runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun

to set ahead of him in the Greek mountains
MOUNTAINS - must make those mountains

BILLY running all out - eyes fixed on them breathing
skipping heartbeats

THE PERSONNEL CARRIER bypasses the FAST SOLDIER who
down panting Billy has outrun him

OTHER SOLDIERS run up in the distance

BILLY stumbles up A gash of blood is on his temple but
doesnt know it or feel it such is his stress He runs
SHOTS whistling towards him from the poppy field
TURKISH OFFICER screaming angrily at Billy cursing
his fist at the sky

BILLY in the forest is totally out of breath and out
eyesight of the pursuers He stops against a tree
SOUNDS The gurgle of water Muddy ground He looks
THE MARITAS RIVER rushing ahead A strong current

BILLY peels off all his clothing except his pants not
delaying one more moment He feels he must keep going

hes right DOGS are barking OFF

A SNARLING ATTACK DOG is tearing through the minefield
fast ahead of the others

BILLY looks sees it
THIRTY YARDS - the huge DOG coming right at him

BILLY runs for the edge of the bank and plunges in

THE ATTACK DOG sprints up to the edge of the river bank
and without a moments hesitation plunges right in

him
BILLY lashing into the current with a fierce breast
is swept downstream kicking futilely

THE DOG its jaws open and clacking is also swept down
river

BILLY going under coming back up - fighting still

THE BASE OF MOUNTAIN - hilly rugged
BILLY runs drags runs again He is a lamentable

naked except for ripped wet pants barefoot bleeding

A FARMHOUSE - TWILIGHT Some cows goats chickens NO
sign of people

BILLY staggers towards it Wears something A rooting
Stops Something familiar about it

A FAMILY OF PIGS snort and root in the mud little
running around

BILLY staggers towards them muttering to himself

BILLY
Pigs Pigs

Then yells in the recognition of it

BILLY
Pigs You Beautiful

BILLY BILLY falls to his knees in the confined pen the
pigs run around squealing Trying to reach out for one

them he falls face first into the mud and lies there
Pause A wooden DOOR squeaks open OFF BILLY slowly

his muddy eyes over his shoulder

OCTOBER 24 1975 - BABYLON LONG ISLAND

Framing Billy are SUSAN and his FATHER both silent

look with him at

HIS SISTER BROTHER UNCLE AUNT SISTER-In-LAW FAMILY
FRIEND - AND GRANDMOTHER all on the porch of the

house in BABYLON LONG ISLAND - DAY all of them

his gaze in that first SILENT moment Curiosity
Recognition Shock Love

And then they move But we dont hear their movements
is SOUNDLESS reunion the SISTER running out first in
MOTION the MOTHER following last crying the

too infirm to move the shaking her head from side to

in SLOW MOTION her tears lost somewhere in the
of her face

BILLY surrounded by FAMILY - SLOW MOTION - SOUNDLESS

His

eyes flooding All the feelings in him And deep
inside -

a solitary question

And OVER this the SOUND of a PASSING TRAIN rushing by
