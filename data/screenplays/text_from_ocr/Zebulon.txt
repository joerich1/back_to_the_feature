A crude log cabin facing a stream in full spring flood
In back towering mountains covered with Douglas Fir An
isolated place in the vast wilderness

One horse and two mules loaded with pelts are tethered
near a crude corral

INT CABIN - DAWN

A Family sits at a rough hewn table - ZEBULON PIKE - a
large powerful man in his late thirties dressed in
greasy buckskins long hair flowing over his shoulders
His wife SARA in her early thirties dark haired and
strong featured Their son JASON a blue eyed rangy boy
of thirteen

Around them the cabin is simple to an extreme Cooking
utensils hanging above a stone fireplace Two rifles
rest over pegs on the wall Abearskin separates the
sleeping quarters of parents and son

The family eats in silence

ON ZEBULON

Pushing back his plate standing up

Without a word he heads for the door

EXT CABIN - DAY

Zebulon sits on his horse Jason hands him the reins to
the pack mules

Zebulon points to a huge Douglas Fir recently felled
lying near the edge of the cabin

ZEBULON
See that gets cut up stacked
nice and neat And fix the shakes
on the roof Mind the new foal

JASON
How long will you be gone Pa

Zebulon looks at Sara who stands by the door

ZEBULON
Not long Not more’n a month

SARA
If your Pa don’t show up

ZEBULON
He’11 show up

SARA
I want somethin’ other than an ax
this time Somethin’ to wear
something nice

Zebulon nods Without another look he rides

away

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

A mountain forest

Zebulon sits high up in a tree

His father SOLOMON PIKE stands looking up at him An
ancient white bearded figure in a beaver hat patched

leggins bear-tooth necklace

Four mules are tethered nearby loaded with pelts their
horses next to then

ZEBULON
Somebody got here before us

SOLOMON
I told you not to cache ‘em
there Any fool would check
that tree

ZEBULON
It was you Pa said to put ‘em
there The ground was too
damn hard to bury ‘em

SOLOMON
Looks like I’m gettin’ too long
in the tooth Been fifty years
I been layin’ traps in these
mountains We got enough as is
If prices be right might be we
can take a year off

ZEBULON
I still got a family to feed

SOLOMON
Well make do Game is still
plenty well maybe not like it
was but enough to go around

Zebulon jumps to the ground

SOLOMON (cont’d)
Let’s ride son As soon as
we put some gold in our pockets
I’m goin’ to raise a powerful
drunk

CUT TO
EXT MOUNTAINS

Zebulon and Solomon ride through the dense shade of a
redwood forest

At the edge of a small clearing they see a herd of deer
Zebulon raises his rifle to shoot

ZEBULON
(lowering his rifle)
Let ‘em be We got enough meat
till we get there

Riding on Solomon breaks into a mountain song old
Long Hatcher gone under on the North PlatteFound him a
bar but the bar laid him flat
Zebulon joins in on the last verses

EXT HILL OVERLOOKING HUDSON BAY TRADING POST - DAY

They sit their horses on a wooded hill overlooking the

Hudson Bay Trading Post -- a large two-story structure
surrounded by shacks and rusting farm machinery Snow-

capped mountains rise up behind then

SOLOMON
Blow ‘er out good son But don’t
spend it all or your wife will
hold me to blame

ZEBULON
Recollect last time it was you
Pa that got skinned in that stud
game

SOLOMON
That was then

They ride slowly towards the Trading Post followed by
the four mules loaded with fur

INT TRADING POST DAY

Solomon and Zebulon enter a huge barn-like room filled
with rifles canned goods farming equipment sacks of
feed etc

Two farmers sit idly by on barrels playing dominoes
STOCKTON a plump middle-aged man in a black cord suit
stands behind the counter reading a month-old paper

SOLOMON
Where’s the Major

STOCKTON
Major Poultry died last winter

SOLOMON
Always was partial to the Major
Dealt with mountain folk straight up

ZEBULON
What be the price of pelts Got
four mules loaded with fur
STOCKTON
You’re eight months too late
There’s no market for furs any-
more I’1l give you fifty cents
a pelt take it or leave it

SOLOMON
No way to fun a man Me and my
son trapped all winter Been on
the trail more’n three weeks
Family men we are Mouths to
feed

He reaches up to a rafter and grabs a leaf of tobacco
stuffing it into his mouth

STOCKTON
The numbers come down from St
Louis I have nothing to do
with them I suggest you find a
new source of income Farming
or the railroad They’re looking
for strong men to lay track north
of here

SOLOMON
Laying track with Chinese niggers
and black Irish Nossir Mr St
Louis I’1l say that again
Nossir Nossir

STOCKTON
You can either trade for it or
take cash

Solomon spits out a mouthful of tobacco juice reaches
across the counter grabs Stockton by the coat

SOLOMON

(to Zebulon)
Son this here’s a flatlander
Store bought and candy fed Worth
about as much as your half-breed
cousin Jack who joined the Cavalry
and died wrong side up

(looking at Stockton)
We’ll take two dollars a pelt
Mr St Louis and a loan on baca
and flour

STOCKTON
Impossible And if you don’t
unhand me I’ll have you arrested
I’ve had it with you mountain
scum Your time has passed but
you’re too mule-headed to know it

SOLOMON
(to Zebulon)
He might be right but I’11 be
damned if I’11 hear it from him

He shoves Stockton against a shelf of canned goods
sending him and the cans crashing to the floor

Solomon reaches behind the counter for a jug of liquor
uncorks it takes a long pull hands it to Zebulon

The two farmers stand up grabbing new ax handles Three
other company men enter from the rear One of them tries
to take the jug away from Solomon but Zebulon drops him
with a right to the jaw

Solomon takes another drink then throws the jug at
Stockton who is trying to rise He draws out his long
Bowie knife One of the farmers looks at him then
Zebulon and leaves by the side door having seen
enough

SOLOMQN
Looks like we’ll have us a
proper rendezvous son
Hurrah for mountain doin’s

He slashes at one of the company men wounding him in
the arm He and Zebulon fight back to back transformed
into lethal mountain men

Zebulon grabs a farmer who is about to smash Solomon over
the head with an ax handle He hugs him as a rib snaps then
drops him writhing to the ground Kicking out with his

foot he drops another with a blow to the stomach

They back towards the door having totally demolished
the store and left three figures on the floor
unconscious
Stockton has grabbed a rifle He fires the bullet
striking Solomon in the chest Zebulon draws his pistol
shooting Stockton in the arm The remaining farmer has
gone beserk half from anger half from fear He picks
up Stockton’s rifle FIRES at Zebulon but hits a barrel
of gas The gas EXPLODES sending flames towards the
ceiling

Zebulon drags the dying Solomon outside

EXT TRADING POST —- DAY

Solomon lies on the ground Zebulon kneels next to hin
oblivious of the Company Men covering him with rifles

In back of them the Trading Post has burst into flames
as men from the shacks try to douse the fire with
buckets of water

SOLOMON

(his voice a whisper)
Deer is deer and elk is elk
son and your old daddy is a
gone coon I ain’t doing
this right I’m too full of
meanness to look straight at
the misty beyond When your
time comes don’t get a mad on
Keep your top knot cool and go
out on your own breath like your
granddaddy done and his daddy
before him Go out in the old
way otherwise it ain’t worth
the doin’ That’s all I got
to say And don’t forget the damn
mountains

With a sad half-smile he dies

STOCKTON
(holding his wounded arm)
Take a last look at those
mountains Where you’re going
there’s going to be a shortage on
beautiful scenery

EXT PRISON - MORNING
SUPERIMPOSE NORTHWEST TERRITORIAL PRISON 1904

The prisoners live in four wooden bunk houses lined up
opposite each other At the far end separated by
barbed wire is Captain Burroughs’ two-story shingled
house to one side the guards’ quarters Surrounding
the entire complex are twenty-foot walls with a guard
tower on each corner Beyond an endless expanse of
brutal desert

The prisoners stand at attention in the yard A bugler
beside the flagpole another guard ready to pull

up the flag

The Captain comes to the door of his house a thin
unshaven figure with half-lidded bleary eyes his face
lined beyond his years He nods and the flag is raised
as the bugler plays reveille

ANOTHER ANGLE

Zebulon staring straight ahead as the flag is raised
Hair greying at the temples eyes deep set and brooding
a look of pain around the corners of his mouth

Reveille over the prisoners move slowly out of the
gate followed by five mounted guards

ground writhing in pain

Two Guards ride over a Third Guard swinging his horse
around to watch Satchel his back momentarily turned to
Zebulon

In one swift move Zebulon knocks the Guard from his

horse with the sledge hammer and grabs the reins

Spurring the horse to a gallop he rides into the
desert

ANOTHER ANGLE

The two Guards turning to FIRE

The bullets spattter near the horse’s heels

For a moment it seems that Zebulon might ride free
ANOTHER ANGLE

A Guard FIRING again

ON ZEBULON

Falling from his horse shot through the heart

INT PRISON HOSPITAL - DAY

Zebulon lies in a bunk in the prison hospital PLUG
SMITH an ancient killer lies in the next bunk The
rest of the hospital is empty

PLUG

(to Zebulon who has

opened his eyes)
Doc says it was hardly worth the
trouble to bring you around
Says you’re five feet under as it
it I’11 lay you three to two you
leave feet first before me Shit

He lies back gasping for breath

DOC SALES enters the ward followed by an orderly
Middle-aged obviously bitter his every gesture a
betrayal of the Hippocratic oath he wears a dirty
blood-stained white smock and a two-day growth of beard
He walks up to Plug’s bed

PLUG
How many days you give him Doc
Thirty thirty-five

boc
Most likely we’1ll bury you
together A double ceremony
Save the tax payers money that

PLUG
Bullshit Hey give me a
cigarette will ya

The Doc hands him a cigarette lights it

PLUG
(inhaling)
I’1l die laughing Doc I
ain’t got a goddam care in
the world I done lived my
days

He leans over spitting out blood beginning to weep
uncontrollably

Doc
(to Zebulon)
I didn’t think you’d pull through

ZEBULON
How much time do I have

DOC
Hard to say You’ve got a bullet
in your heart It’1lkill you if
we try to cut it out You might

a month But you’1ll go

Zebulon turns his head away

PLUG

smells the worms chewin’ on his
tongue He ain’t no competition
Bring in another one I’m the
goddam king of this ward

CUT TO
INT PRISON CAPTAIN’S ROOM - DAY
The Captain sits behind his desk

The room is in shambles walls covered with maps books
stacked in the corners Indian artifacts scattered
about a framed picture of his father - Colonel
Burroughs - a half-empty bottlé of whiskey a dirty
shirt over a chair

The door opens and Zebulon enters passing by the guard
He wears the prison uniform his face still ravaged and
pale from the hospital

CAPTAIN
Yes What is it Pike

ZEBULON
I want to ask for parole

CAPTAIN
(looking through
Zebulon’s papers)
You’re a bit early aren’t you
You’re not eligible for twenty
years

dd
ZEBULON
The Doc doesn’t give me more
than a month I’d like to see my
family before I go

CAPTAIN
A noble sentiment But we’re all
serving time here I can’t see
any reason to make you an
exception

ZEBULON
Then it’s no

’ CAPTAIN
How many years have you been
here Pike Five Six Two
attempted escapes one badly
beaten guard Why should I bend
for you when you’ve never bent
for me

Zebulon stares at him then at a Cheyenne war bonnet
hanging on the wall He walks around the side of the
desk to look at it

ZEBULON
Cheyenne

CAPTAIN
They were great warriors

Suddenly Zebulon picks up a thin dagger from the desk
used as a paper weight Before the Captain or the guard
can move he shoves it underneath the Captain’s chin
drawing a small drop of blood The guard - RAFE- raises
his rifle pulling back the bolt

ZEBULON
Drop it or I’1l run the
Captain through

CAPTAIN
(to Rafe)
Drop it
Rafe drops it
ZEBULON

Stand in front of the desk

Rafe does as he’s told

CAPTAIN
You’1l never make it

ZEBULON
Probaly not but what happens to
me will sure as hell happen to
you

The Captain shuts his eyes his lips quivering Zebulon
reaches down and takes his revolver from its holster

CAPTAIN
You can have your parole

ZEBULON
You’re full of shit

RAFE
Jesus Zeb I never done nothing
to you myself Never leaned on
you or nothin’

The Captain starts to fold fighting a losing battle
with his own fear and humiliation

CAPTAIN
I’m begging for my life That’s
what you want isn’t it

ZEBULON
You don’t have a life worth
begging for We’re going out Try
not to wet your pants

They walk towards the door Zebulon holding the revolver
to the Captain’s head Rafe going before

RAFE
(trembling his hands up)
Don’t nobody do nothing He’s got
the Captain and he’s crazy

LOBO NED a half breed scout mean and vicious if not
actually demented flattens himself against the wall
behind the door his revolver raised As Zebulon comes
out Lobo shoves the revolver against his head

For a moment no one moves as if they are waiting for
the shots that will send two brains splattering across
the room The Captain breaks first

CAPTAIN
Drop it Lobo

Lobo pulls the hammer back

LOBO NED
I’m paid to stop prisoners
that’s all

CAPTAIN
You goddam fool I said drop it

LOBO NED
Tell him to drop it Not me
I don’t drop nothin’

CAPTAIN
Your choice Zebulon We either
both live or both die

Zebulon hesitates looks around at Lobo who smiles at
him coldly Slowly he lowers his hand dropping the
revolver to the floor The Captain picks it up

CAPTAIN

(to Zebulon)
You put too much value on a
miserable few days of life

He smashes Zebulon over the head with the butt of the
revolver dropping him unconscious to the floor

CAPTAIN
Put the son of a bitch in the
hole

INT THE HOLE - PRISON

Zebulon sits in the hole a three by four foot cell with
not enough room to lie down in Above him a small barred
window lets in a thin shaft of light He looks thinner
closer to death

The metal door opens and the Captain steps in his
pistol drawn Zebulon stares at him blinking his eyes

CAPTAIN
I told them to leave your belt
on I thought you might have hung
yourself

ZEBULON
I thought about it

CAPTAIN
And you still find life so
precious

ZEBULON
I’d as soon go for it as not

CAPTAIN
You’re either extremely ignorant
or unbearably hopeful

ZEBULON
I’m just breathing in and out
The same as you

CAPTAIN
I’m putting you on the work
detail but you’1ll spend your
nights here I want to make your
final days as full as possible

ZEBULON
They must have hroke you pretty
bad to have sent you out here
What was it Lost your men in
some half assed battle or did you
just turn and run

The Captain stares at Zebulon hating him trying to
keep control over himself

CAPTAIN
(turning to leave)
Tell the sergeant your next of
kin 111 write a few words to
them about your moral character
when you’ve ah circulated

He leaves

EXT DESERT - DAY

The prisoners work on the road

A chuck wagon stands off to one side A young guard --
LEMUEL -- watches Zebulon as he ladles water from a

barrel into two buckets

ANOTHER ANGLE

A buckboard drives up dust billowing behind it

Captain sits in the back seat an umbrella protecting

him from the sun

ANOTHER ANGLE

Lemuel is uneasy under the baleful eyes of the Captain

Zebulon drinks

Zebulon walks slowly over to the prisoners working on
the road stooping under the weight of the buckets

LEMUEL
Captain says he don’t want no one
too close to the chuck wagon
Says it breaks the work stride to
be thinking on water and lunch
slop Says to put a thousand
steps in between

from the ladle

ZEBULON
I’1l never make a thousand steps

LEMUEL
Today you ain’t ‘got a choice
This be the first time he’s come
out in two weeks

ZEBULON
(picking up the
two buckets)
I’1l try not to cash it in while
you’re on duty

LEMUEL
I’d appreciate it I’m no good
at last words

Sweat pours off his forehead He is obviously
straining unable to breathe He sets downs the

buckets

ANOTHER ANGLE

The Captain taps his driver with a swagger stick
pointing towards Zebulon

ANOTHER ANGLE

Zebulon swaying on his feet stares blankly at the
Captain as the buckboard stops in front of him

The driver ladles water into a cup and hands it to the
Captain

CAPTAIN
(to Lemuel)
I want this man breaking rocks
not standing around drinking
water

The Captain taps the driver and they drive off towards
the prison

Zebulon waits until they’ve disappeared then picks up
the water buckets Twenty steps later he falls to his
knees both hands clutching his chest

A guard -- BENT -- old and weathered the slump of his
body an ironic question mark walks his horse over to
Zebulon e

BENT
Ain’t time for a vacation
Zeb lessen you figure on one
permanent

Zebulon looks at him and pitches forward

Lemuel comes over

LEMUEL
It’s his pump
BENT
Might as well take him in
LEMUEL
It don’t look like he’1l last

the ride

EXT CHUCK WAGON - DESERT

Lemuel drives the chuck wagon Bent next to him on the
high seat

Inside Zebulon is stretched out on his back eyes
closed Bent’s horse has been tied to the rear of the
wagon and trots behind They pass a pint of cheap
whiskey between them

LEMUEL
What’s old Zeb pullin’

BENT
Life and then some

LEMUEL
Lotta times these old mountain
boys they serve time and they
just don’t want to live no more

ANOTHER ANGLE

Zebulon has turned himself around and is slowly crawling
forward his right hand a foot away from Lemuel’s rifle
which lies on the seat between him and Bent Lemuel
turns to spit Zebulon freezes his hand inches away
from the rifle stock As Zebulon makes his move Bent
senses him turns yells out

They struggle for the rifle

Bent manages to free the rifle He FIRES off a quick
SHOT at Zebulon but the bullet strikes Lemuel who falls
to the ground shot through the chest

Zebulon kicks Bent in the stomach grabbing the rifle
He pulls up the horses covering Bent

BENT
(bending over Lemuel)
Damn I didn’t mean to kill hin
Honest to God

He sits down on the ground looking morosely at Lemuel

LEMUEL
You shot me Bent

BENT
I did son and I’m going to lose
sleep over it

LEMUEL
Am I dying

BENT
I reckon you are

Lemuel starts to cry

EXT DESERT - DAY

Lemuel lies on the ground Zebulon sitting beside him
covering Bent who is unhitching the horses from the
chuck wagon Bent wears Zebulon’s prison clothes while
Zebulon is dressed in Bent’s uniform

ZEBULON
(to Bent)
Slap ’em off They’1l find their
way home

Bent spanks the horses and they trot off

Zebulon props up Lemuel’s head letting him swallow a
drop of whiskey

LEMUEL
(whimpering)
Oh God it hurts It hurts

real bad
(looking up at Zebulon)
Looks like I’m going to beat you

to it
ZEBULON
I‘1ll be right behind you
LEMUEL
(crying)

I ain’t ready Oh Lord I don’t
want to die Don’t let me go

Bent walks over sits down Zebulon hands him the pint
of whiskey

BENT

LEMUEL

LEMUEL

woman once That’s a lie I
don’t wanna go out telling no
lie I ain’t never been with no
woman ‘cept a whore down in
Lizaville

ZEBULON
That counts

Lemuel shuts his eyes his breath is labored blood
spilling out of his gut

LEMUEL
(his voice a whisper)
How do I do it I don’t know how
to do it

ZEBULON
Just let go son and don’t look
back There ain’t that much
to leave anyways

LEMUEL
Play me a tune Bent and tell
‘em I went straight up

Bent pulls out a harmonica plays a few bars of a
strange haunting tune

Lemuel shudders tries to sit up looks around wild -
eyed fearful then falls back dying in Zebulon’s arms

BENT
I’1l bury him You’1l1 need all
the time you can get

Zebulon raises his rifle FIRES three quick shots at the
top of the telegraph pole shattering the two lines

BENT
I figure you riden back home

Zebulon unties Bent’s horse from behind the chuck wagon
and mounts up

BENT
Man got a right to one last ride
Choose his spot before he be dead
meat Well you never know my
daddy got suckered from behind by
a drunken deputy down in Rosewater

Zebulon rides off

A small figure lost in the immense solitude of the
desert

EXT MAXWELL - DAY

Maxwell is an expanding logging town in the foothills
As Zebulon rides through the outskirts of town he passes
a sawmill and a yard full of homemade cages containing a
variety of animals coyotes racoons snakes dogs
weasels etc

A boy - RODNEY - throws some meat to the racoons
Suddenly the air is shattered by a burst of gunfire

The population of Maxwell has gathered around the

Panorama Saloon which occupies a prominent place on the
town square

A handful of men crouch behind overturned wagons and a
Model A Ford occasionally sending a SHOT through one
of the windows of the saloon The rest of the populace
has created a strange festive air playing cards
drinking riding bicycles having a barn sell There is
even one sleazy huckster performing card tricks and
selling framed photographs of the White House and the
Chicago World’s Fair

Zebulon hitches his horse behind a building out of the
line of fire

Two old men -- HANK and RED -- sit outside the building
on a bench

ZEBULON

up beyond the bunched houses of the desperate little

town

Zebulon nods

ZEBULON

They FIRE a heavy round into the Saloon

A shotgun blasts out from the window of the Saloon
followed by a rifle shot

Zebulon waits a beat then runs to the side of the
Saloon Holding the bag in front of him he inches
towards a side window He waits for a lull in the
firing then heaves the sack through the window

A long pause

The Saloon erupts with curses screams and a furious
round of gunfire

Zebulon keeping out of sight from the window inches
around to the rear

INT PANORAMA SALOON

Zebulon easing himself throughthe side window his
rifle ready

Caleb crouches behind an overturned table furiously
trying to load a Sharp’s rifle The two shotguns lie
beside hin

Caleb is old and thin with a long curtain of white hair
framing his face Half his teeth are missing A long
scar runs down his cheek slanting one eye and pulling
down the corner of his mouth A mink and otter cap is
pulled over the top of his head Half one leg is blown
away and blood drips from a shoulder wound

A small round figure stands on top of the bar - LORENZO
He wears a painter’s smock and a small beret on his
head Behind him there is a half finished mural showing
white mountains herds of buffalo Indians chasing
horses a cavalry charge cowboys roping steers etc

A Chinaman crouches against the far wall a rope around
his neck the end of which has been tied around Caleb’s
wrist He wears loose cotton pants and jacket and his
hair is knotted behind him in a long pigtail

Dead rattlesnakes lie scattered over the floor some of
them blown into pieces

ZEBULON
Howdy Caleb Them Sharps always
did get overheated

CALEB
Only damned thing wrong with ‘em

ZEBULON
Apologize about the rattlers

CALEB

He loads a shotgun places it near him then touches the
Sharps finds it still too hot to load Zebulon lowers
his rifle

ZEBULON

What’s it worth

CALEB

(throwing him a pouch

of tobacco)
A plew a plug Powder‘s worse
It be hard times son Come

Zebulon looks up at Lorenzo who is trying to signal his
attention

ON A HUGE RATTLESNAKE

Slowly slithering out from behind the bar Zebulon looks
at the snake then takes a chew of tobacco

CALEB
Wagh But we’re damp fire
and no powder to dry us

He jerks the rope around the Chinaman’s neck

CALEB
Wake up ya damn little yeller
nigger and get us a bottle of
that Taos White Lightning

The Chinaman edging along the wall to avoid the snake
goes behind the bar and returns with a bottle of whiskey

CALEB
How ya like what the little

tory See the white niggers over
yonder Mountain men they be
I got him to put in all kinds of
fufforow He’s just a little

Lord’s English

Caleb takes a pull from the bottle then starts to sag
He is clearly dying The snake has crawled underneath a
chair a few feet from him hissing and moving its head
back and forth

CALEB
Elk is elk meat’s meat but now
I’m a gone coon

(in a low chant)

Heya heya heya yo-h- yp-ho

The Captain steps into a ramshackle building which
serves as the telegraph postal and newspaper offices
as well as Stebbins’ living quarters in the back

The place is a chaotic shambles an ancient printing

press stands against one wall surrounded by stacks of
old newspapers two broken typewriters the telegraph
key mounted on a rickety platform pictures of Teddy

Roosevelt the King of England a steam ship and the

Brooklyn Bridge Books are stacked everywhere

Stebbins sits in front of a roll-top desk overflowing
with papers a half-empty bottle of whiskey next to him

STEBBINS
I’ve been expecting you Captain
I must say your reputation
proceeds you

The Captain looks at him oddly trying to place hin

STEBBINS
Cuba Captain - we passed each
other briefly after the battle
of San Juan Hill I was one of
many correspondents I doubt
you would remember given the
dramatic context of that day

CAPTAIN
I don’t recall

Stebbins pours the Captain a drink and takes one himself

STEBBINS
I always wondered why your gallant
charge was so neglected by the
press but then I suppose we
both have suffered a certain neglect
or we wouldn’t meet in such provincial
circumstances But there’s no profit
in reading yesterday’s news is there
I assume you know all about Zebulon
Pike and the people he comes from

CAPTAIN
I know that he escaped from my
prison shot a young guard in cold
blood and that he doesn’t have long
to live one way or the other
He has a bullet in his heart

STEBBINS
How do you want your telegram
phrased

Stebbins goes over to the telegraph key

CAPTAIN
‘Proceeding north by northwest
from Maxwell after escaped
convict Capture expected
within days’

STEBBINS
Terse and to the point although
it won’t do you a lot of good

CAPTAIN
I didn’t come to Maxwell for
conversation Stebbins

STEBBINS
No I have observed before that
you are a man of action

to San Francisco

CAPTAIN
So be it Mr Stebbins but don’t
let the story ride too far ahead of
the facts

STEBBINS
We ride together Captain Mine
to write and yours to do

HENRIETTA
It’s thrilling when a man
of strong deeds and a man of
poetic contemplation are joined
in a common purpose

STEBBINS

bloodshot )
We ride together at first light

HENRIETTA
Oh Sam it will be so glorious

STEBBINS
It is our salvation my dear

HENRIETTA
Take care of him Captain he’s
all that I have

Confused the Captain regards this complicated couple

CAPTAIN
I will ma’an

STEBBINS
Our main problem of course is
timing We have to close on him
but not too quickly The story
has to build to capture the
imagination of the public We
have to bring him in like a caged
beast After a dramatic chase a
rousing climax

His head slumps on the table

STEBBINS
My job of course A lifetime
at it No problem at all

Stebbins passes out

HENRIETTA
(looking at the Captain
intensely)

Yes ah Henrietta you set a

splendid table Would you like me
to help him into the bedroom

They stare at each other She reaches out and touches
his hand

HENRIETTA
You are sent from heaven to
rescue us both Captain may I
call you Jed But first you must
rescue me It might not appear
so but I am a lonely woman

She gets up goes to the gramophone winds it up

HENRIETTA
Some Chopin No Perhaps the
Moonlight Sonata
(looking at him)
- Just this one moment outside
of time For you too are a
lonely wretched outcast

She replaces the Moonlight Sonata with a popular DANCE
RECORD Smiling she walks toward him

He crosses to her taking her in his arms They slowly
dance around the table They stop and embrace He leans
her against the billiard table fondling her breasts

HENRIETTA
Not here darling

Stebbins gets up lurches into the bedroom passing out
on the bed They watch his course then return to each
other

HENRIETTA
On the billiard green then
my darling Take me in your
wild fashion

She lies back closing her eyes and spreading her legs as
the Captain unbuttons his pants

For a moment he hesitates staring down at her with a

look of total despair Then sighing he plunges into
her

EXT MOUNTAINS —- DAY

Zebulon walks his horse along a mountain trail Reaching
down he breaks off a branch from a small tree letting
it drop behind him He retraces his steps and walks off
in the opposite direction

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

Zebulon has made a camp on the bank of a swiftly flowing
river He sits with his back against several huge logs
once the foundation of a hunting lodge cooking a rabbit
over a fire Another rabbit still alive is staked to
the ground His hat rests on tap of the log

A few hundred feet away two wooden platforms are raised
on poles hosting the shrouded remains of dead Indians
Next to the platforms stand three totem poles each over
fifteen feet high

The area is an ancient burial ground long since
abandoned The grotesquely carved figures on the totem
poles together with the white gleam of bone sticking
through the shrouds on the platforms create a haunting
strangeness as if the departed spirits are still
somehow present

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY
Lobo Ned Crow Dog and Lingo ride Zebulon’s trail Crow

Dog stops his horse motions towards the snapped branch

Lobo Ned dismounts studies the trail then walks back
in the opposite direction Kneeling he sees Zebulon’s
real direction

Taking three stones he forms a crude arrow pointing
along the trail

EXT MOUNTAINS - EVENING

Lobo Ned Lingo and Crow Dog have dismounted their
horses on the edge of a thick line of trees facing the
river

Zebulon’s horse is picketed near the river the top of
his hat just visible over the edge of the logs

LOBO NED
(to Lingo)
Take the right side and keep out
of sight
(to Crow Dog)
Circle the other way 111 cover
you from here

CROW DOG
Don’t smell right Wait for dark

LOBO NED
It’s dark enough Any darker and
he’11 stick one in you from behind

Crow Dog shudders He and Lingo drop to the ground and
begin to inch slowly forward Lobo Ned cocks his rifle
takes up a position covering the area

ANGLE - CROW DOG

Crawling towards the log sweat glistening on his
forehead There is no sound no movement just the thin
curl of smoke

ANGLE - LOBO NED

Watching the two Breeds reaching the hat Zebulon’s
horse neighs stomps nervously Out of the corner

of his eye Lobo Ned catches a movement from underneath
one of the burial platforms He shifts his position
aiming his rifle

Zebulon’s rifle is just visible beside one of the poles
and what looks like his body underneath a blanket The
blanket shifts again

Lobo Ned crouches moves toward the platform A hundred
feet away he stands and fires into the moving blanket

ANGLE - CROW DOG
Startled by the shot fires at the hat
ANGLE LINGO

Terrified flattens himself on the ground then manages
a wild shot towards the hat

ANGLE - LOBO NED

Firing again then again The blanket is still He
waits then signals the others

CROW DOG
I got him

Lingo and Crow Dog stand up Crow Dog looks behind the
log sees Zebulon’s hat propped up

Cautiously all three walk towards the platform Lobo
Ned fires another shot into the blanket The other two
fire a few shots

Lobo Ned still not entirely sure waits for them to
check out the blanket

Crow Dog kicks the blanket away A rabbit staked to
the ground lies in front of them shot to pieces They
look around terrified
ANGLE - LOBO NED
Dropping to the ground looking for Zebulon
ANGLE - ZEBULON
Looking down through a hole in the platform His face
visible among the shrouds and protruding bones where he
has been hiding

ZEBULON

Hope you boys didn’t mess up
my dinner

He covers them with his revolver

Lobo Ned fires a shot into the platform the bullet
slamming into an old skull

Zebulon fires back hitting him in the chest Lobo Ned
drops to the ground dying

Crow Dog and Lingo drop their rifles raising their hands
above their heads

ZEBULON
Just kind of spread-eagle out
on the ground boys and it’1l
make things a whole lot easier

They drop to the ground

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY

Zebulon slowly walks his horse toward an Indian
settlement on the banks of a river Emaciated children
stare at him as he approaches

A woman placing bread into an outdoor oven straightens
up looks at him disappears into a shack A crude
corral hosts several mangy horses Half a dozen teepees
stand next to the same number of shacks

The settlement is caught in a bizarre mutation between
the white world and the traditional Indian ways

Several of the shacks and teepees have fences around
them of boards old signs anything that looks as if it
came from the white man’s civilization Parts of rusting
machinery are placed next to an outhouse a billboard
advertising a facial cream leans next to a smashed
victriola

An ancient Indian comes out of a teepee dressed in cord
pants greasy shirt and bowler hat -- MAD BEAR A half-
breed -- FLATHEAD FRANK -- walks slowly up from the
river He is equally ancient -- gold earring in one

ear black Navajo hat with a white eagle’s feather stuck
in the brin

A white man -- MR FLOWERS -- comes out of a shack
the only one painted white with a blue trim around the
windows Young and earnest he is a combination school
teacher Indian agent doctor and preacher

Zebulon raises his hand to greet them then falls from
his horse

INT SHACK - DAY

Zebulon lies on a straw mat inside a dark low-ceilinged
shack hung with bearskins and strings of bear teeth next
to colored pictures cut out of magazines and newspapers

An altar with a brightly painted crucifix stands against
one wall along with several animal masks bird feathers
and a cracked boar’s skull

Zebulon opens his eyes and stares at

An OLD CRONE shaking a rattle over his body She wears a
motley array of fur and torn gingham and a black Stetson
hat too big for her Laying down the rattle she bangs a
box drum moaning she bends over and listens to his
heart °

Flathead Frank and Mad Bear sit nearby on the floor
smoking a pipe between them and sharing a jug of
homemade whiskey

The old crone sees that Zebulon is awake and retreats to
the other side of the shack

ZEBULON
(noticing Mad Bear
and Flathead Frank)
How long I been out

FLATHEAD FRANK
Not more’n a day

ZEBULON
Thought for a moment I woke up
dead

Mad Bear grunts then laughs slowly
MAD BEAR
Blue coats come Your woman

live with Hatchet Jack Maybe
better you die

Mad Bear’s wife BLACK STOCKING white-haired and stern
enters carrying a bowl of soup She wears a flowered
print dress and heavy boots She scowls at Mad Bear
then says something in the Indian language to the old
crone Mad Bear yells at her She yells back pointing
at Zebulon then making the sign of the cross She puts
the bowl of soup beside Zebulon

BLACK STOCKING
(to Zebulon)
You drink Then take pills You
be all right

She leaves but not before snarling again at Mad Bear

ZEBULON
Looks like you got troubles
of your own Mad Bear

to a small boy LITTLE KNIFE his grandson He takes
the book that Little Knife carries and throws it away
Little Knife runs after it Black Stocking yells at Mad
Bear

FLATHEAD FRANK
The old boy is some riled since
you came Can’t get the thought
of them blue coats out of his
head

Mad Bear advances toward his wife Walking inside the
fence he starts to pull up flowers She screams and
hits him over the head with her shovel He sits down in
the flower bed and folds his arms assuming a dignified
posture Black Stocking goes inside the shack slamming
the door behind her

FLATHEAD FRANK
Looks like he’s fixin’ to go to
war Why don’t you stay here
This is as good a place as any to
go under

ZEBULON
Figured to see the family one

other women past the children and other men who

the DINNER BELL outside the cabin door sending an ECHO
ringing through the woods

Zebulon and the mountain family stare at eath other as
the canoe floats around a curve in the river and
disappears

EXT MOUNTAINS - DUSK

Stebbins has set up his typewriter on a makeshift table
typing a dispatch The Captain sits nearby reading a book

ANOTHER ANGLE

Several troopers roll dice with the posse Others play
cards

The rest of the Troops are in various stages of undress
getting ready for the night

ANOTHER ANGLE - MAD BEAR

Beginning his charge down the hill weaving his horse in and
out of the trees Coming into the open he gallops
straight at the camp yelling his war cry

ANOTHER ANGLE

A guard -- Eaton -- raises his rifle FIRES -- the bullet
missing Mad Bear He drops his rifle and runs into the
trees

The Captain stands and yells at him to stop furious
as he tries to rally his troops But the troops panic as
they try to find cover from the attack

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mad Bear FIRES at Red struggling to get out of his
blanket Red falls Shot through the head

ANOTHER ANGLE

Mad Bear Charges straight through the camp striking
another trooper with his tomahawk SHOOTING Rem in the
foot

The Captain stands his ground holding his sword aloft
but Mad Bear rides up the opposite hill a HAIL OF
BULLETS following suffering only a flesh wound in his
shoulder

ANOTHER ANGLE - MAD BEAR

Looks down at the camp The Captain has placed everyone in
a line of defense forming a rough perimeter Three other
troopers struggle to control the horses

Mad Bear starts his death song again then slowly rides
forward As he reaches the edge of the woods he spurs
his horse to a gallop heading straight for the Captain’s
tent

A DOZEN BULLETS knock him off his horse
ON THE CAPTAIN

Standing amidst the chaotic aftermath of Mad Bear’s final
charge

Eaton is brought up to him handcuffed

CAPTAIN
(to Eaton)
You ran at the first sign of
the enemy I will have you

shot
EATON
I sure hope you don’t Captain
CAPTAIN
(to Bent)

Take him away
Bent leads Eaton away sitting him down next to a tree

Stebbins who has been watching this interchange walks up
to the Captain shaking his head

CAPTAIN
The man is a coward On any
battlefield in the world he
would be lined up and shot

STEBBINS
Don’t be a fool If you don’t
let him go you risk everything

CAPTAIN
I’11l deal with it later

STEBBINS
No Captain you’1l deal with it
now or you’1ll lose me and the rest
of the town of Maxwell

CAPTAIN
Are you questioning my authority

STEBBINS
Yes I am If you don’t want to
become a minor historical
footnote you’ll do as I say

He walks away

CAPTAIN
(calling across
to Bent)
Let him go but take away his
stripe

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAWN

Rem his foot in a crude splint sits his horse ready to
ride The Captain stands next to hin

Stebbins walks up to them stuffing a sheaf of papers
into a pouch

STEBBINS

(handing the pouch

to the Captain)
Reports for the newspapers of
an Indian uprising and the battle
of Lost Valley -- for want of a
better name The first Indian
uprising in fifteen years should
get some play in the press

The Captain hands the pouch to Rem who puts it in his saddle
bag

CAPTAIN
(handing another piece
of paper to Rem)
This is a telegram to the Army
Command informing them of the
situation Will you be able to
get through

REM
I’1l make it

ANOTHER ANGLE

A fight has started between two members of the posse and
a Trooper Poke tries to break it up

The Captain FIRES his revolver into the air They turn to hin
He stands on a log addressing them

CAPTAIN
Yesterday we had the misfortune
of running into one drunken
Indian off the reservation
That’s all I anticipate no more
trouble but from now on we‘Il
double the guard I remind you
that as long as you’re under my
command I will tolerate no
insubordination The first man
to go against an order any
order will return to Maxwell in
chains Now let’s ride

They mount and ride off as Rem gallops the other way
toward Maxwell

EXT MOUNTAINS - DAY
Zebulon paddles toward a clearing on the shore

Hatchet Jack’s Trading Post thrusts itself out from the
surrounding wilderness The main building is a two-
story structure composed of sod patched canvas and
thick pine logs To one side stands a weathered barn
with most of the shakes blown off The corral hosts a
few winter-starved horses

BIG FOOT DAVIS the father of Sara Zebulon’s wife sits
by the shore his back to a cottonwood tree His legs
are loosely spread a nearly empty bottle leaning
against his crotch

Big Foot is bent with age his face weighted by a long
white beard and topped by a black Captain’s hat A
fishing pole leans against the cottonwood no hook at
the end of the line

ZEBULON
Howdy Big Foot

Big Foot stares at Zebulon open-mouthed as he beaches
the canoe

BIG FOOT
If‘n I had my shooter I’d sure
put one into you son Let you

Big Foot looks

ZEBULON
Had to check out on my own
Sara to home

BIG FOOT

ZEBULON

BIG FOOT
Now listen Zebulon Hatchet he

got a right to some comfort
Sara don’t offer no complaints so
why don’t you just set sail

ZEBULON

up family harmony Got me a bad
pump Might go out any minute
Figure it’s my God-given right to
see my wife and boy before I go
under

at him sighs and nods his head

BIG FOOT
(handing him the bottle)
Have a drink son and welcome
home

INT TRADING POST - DAY

Big Foot and Zebulon walk through the front door

The main room of the Trading Post has been divided into
two parts by a long piece of canvas stretched over a
rope On one side of the room are ballels of supplies
canned goods trapping tools firearms and powder On
the other side is Hatchet Jack’s living area a long
plank table an open hearth skins hanging on the walls
To one side stands a smashed three legged piano with
most of the keys missing Two other smaller rooms

are off to the side

MA DAVIS Big Foot’s wife cooks over the fireplace a
small taut white haired woman with wire-rimmed glasses
and a faded gingham dress

HATCHET JACK sits in a chair staring morosely at a
Sears Roebuck catalogue He is tall and emaciated his
hair tied behind him with a leather thong his body
covered with faded red long johns

BIG FOOT
Looky who’s here

They turn and stare at Zebulon

MA DAVIS
Drop the son of a bitch Hatchet
He can’t carry off no daughter of
mine

HATCHET JACK
Don’t see why Zebulon can’t stop
and water his horse when he’s
passing by

He stands up nervously picks up an ax handle sets it
down Finally looks at Zebulon

HATCHET JACK
I been real fine to her Zeb
Feed her bettern’ a prize sow
Sent for a piana and a mail order
dress She ain’t got no complaints

MA DAVIS
Sara done what any woman would

BIG FOOT
Amen to that

Sara appears in the door carrying a bucket of milk
Beauty still lingers in her face but she has aged her
shoulders are stooped her eyes narrowed and weary

SARA
Hello Zebulon

ZEBULON

Hello Sara The years ain’t
harmed you none

ZEBULON sighs

SARA
I couldn’t make it alone I never
thought you’d make it out of

SARA
Well I didn’t know Not after

SARA

HATCHET JACK

BIG FOOT
Zeb broke out Army looking for
him Got himself a bad pump

whole truth ain’t it Zeb

ZEBULON
That’s about the size of it

MA DAVIS
You mean you rode all this way
just to drop dead on us

HATCHET JACK
Don’t hardly seem worth it does
it

Zebulon sags against the wall

ZEBULON
I’ll rest awhile

SARA
At first I did Then I made

He reaches out and touches her

ZEBULON

can do this right

SARA
I never stopped loving you but
you sure never made things easy

of me always will be

Zebulon pulls her to him At first she resists and then
she gives in Zebulon stops

ZEBULON
Where’s Hatchet

SARA
Bedded down in the barn

They kiss He reaches out for a fuller embrace but she
pulls away

SARA
Are you up to it Your heart I
mean

ZEBULON

Save everyone a lot of trouble

She stands up looking at him Not taking her eyes off
him she undresses

ANOTHER ANGLE

They make love slowly tenderly

looking at Zebulon She cries softly He turns to her

SARA

EXT MOUNTAINS - EVENING

The Troops are camped by a small stream Some are
washing others eating The rest are already asleep

ON THE CAPTAIN AND STEBBINS
Sitting by a small fire

STEBBINS
Three gone two dead one
wounded Not an attractive
report I’m beginning to feel
that he’s in control that he’s
playing with us

CAPTAIN
Totally absurd He’s a simple-
minded savage going in a direct
line back to the only thing he
knows His wretched family

STEBBINS
I wish it was that simple

CAPTAIN

But it is It is that simple
It’s only us that’s complicated

EXT TRADING POST - DAY

earth Ma

MA DAVIS

ZEBULON
(laughing)
These days you got to trade in

He sits on his mount waiting until she gallops back and
reins in beside him

SARA
Damn you Damn you for always

EXT LOG CABIN - DAY

JESSE STILLWATER sits in front of a crude log cabin
surrounded by giant redwoods -- fur hat covering a
wrinkled face greasy buckskins grizzled and bent with
age staring at a chaotic display of household items
pots pans traps tools linens beartooth necklace
waterlogged books etc

Jesse holds up buck saw puts it down again

JESSE
(Yelling inside the cabin)
You want the buck saw

EBEN (0S)
The buck saw Damn right I want
the buck saw

JESSE
You want it you take it Take
whatever you want You want me
clothes take ‘em You want my
Sharps and ‘Grizzer trap you take
it I don’t give a damn

Jesse picks up a flute starts to play

From inside the cabin Eben has started to play a
fiddle

ON EBEN

Gaunt with a long white beard Coming to the door
playing the fiddle sawing away with ferocious abandon

Behind them unnoticed the Captain and his command now
reduced to less than a dozen men appear at the edge of
the clearing

Eben puts down the fiddle

EBEN
You want the fiddle you take it

JESSE

Hell Eben I hate that fiddle
I’d just use it for kindling

They turn
ANGLE ON THE CAPTAIN AND HIS TROOPS
Riding up

CAPTAIN
Do you men know Zebulon Pike

EBEN
Ain’t nobody within a hundred
miles don’t know Zebulon Pike

CAPTAIN
He’s a wanted man Broke out of
the territorial prison Killed a
man

JESSE
Don’t sound like Zebulon to me
Zebulon I know would have killed
at least a dozen

CAPTAIN
Have you seen him
JESSE
Can’t say that we have
STEBBINS
How many days to his son’s place
JESSE
Two Depending on how hard you
take it
CAPTAIN

We’ll have to keep you for
awhile Can’t take a chance on
him finding out we’re here

EBEN
The hell you say

He reaches for a rifle lying on the ground but Bent has
him covered

EXT MOUNTAINS - EVENING

Jesse and Eben are tied to a tree trunk

Behind them the Troops have made camp and are eating a
silent meal

ON POKE
Walking over with two plates of food

He puts down the plates and unlocks their handcuffs
then hands them their supper

JESSE
Bunch of lame greenhorns you’re
riden’ with Sheriff

POKE
That’s the truth

EBEN
No way you’ll bring Zeb in He’1l
pull his own plug first

POKE
I reckon that’s also the truth

EBEN
Recollect Zeb come on me one
winter down on the Green River
Half froze I was and near dead
from a sprung bear trap Carried
me more’n three days to the Doc

POKE
I always said he was someone to
ride the river with

JESSE
Too bad there ain’t a soul to
give him the word I figure he’s
earned that right

Poke shrugs looking off into the distance Then he
walks away but not before leaving a knife within Eben’s
grasp

EXT MOUNTAIN CAMP - NIGHT

The Captain and his Troops are asleep Except for

Stebbins who sits near a kerosene lamp He’s drunk his
brow furrowed with effort as he tries to write a dispatch

STEBBINS (vo)
Already the cunning cruelty of
the infamous outlaw Zebulon Pike
has spread a trail of blood and
terror across this land one of
the last truly primitive and
uncivilized areas left on the
North American frontier And yet
Captain Burroughs always at the
front of his small resolute band
of volunteers refuses to give up

ANOTHER ANGLE

Further away Eben cuts the rope binding him and Jesse
to the tree

Slowly they make their escape
ON STEBBINS

Looking up deep in thought as he gazes into the
darkness He takes another pull from his bottle

Something moves in front of him He peers into the
darkness

ON JESSE AND EBEN
Running into the woods
Stebbins shouts waking the cup

Stebbins pulls out his revolver FIRES three shots

Jesse is hit in the back

Eben gets away disappearing into the woods

EXT MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Eben hides under a windfall of branches as the Posse
hunts for him on horseback lanterns casting beams of
light through the giant trees

The Riders disappear and Eben begins slowly to inch his
way forward

EXT MOUNTAINS - NIGHT

Stebbins kneels by Jesse’s body Around him the Posse
crashes through the underbrush looking for Eben

Jesse’s fur hat has fallen off Stebbins stares at the
long hair the blood oozing out from the torn shirt a
breast half exposed In shock he kneels before her

STEBBINS
(staring at Jesse)
Oh God Oh no no

The Captain walks up behind Stebbins

CAPTAIN
The other one got away We
might have wounded him At
least he’s on foot

He looks down at the body sees that Jesse is a woman

CAPTAIN (cont’d)
So you finally did it Stebbins
Killed someone in the flesh rather
than in print And a woman as well

Stebbins turns away He begins to cry as he loses
control

Impatient the Captain looks at him

CAPTAIN F
Oh come on Stebbins You shot a
prisoner who was escaping Man
woman what difference does it
make It was necessary

The Captain draws Stebbins away putting a hand on his
shoulder which Stebbins shrugs off

CAPTAIN
I’ve killed Men Women and
Children You can’t let them get
inside you haunt you
Stebbins walks away
The Captain follows him taking a flask out of his
pocket

CAPTAIN
Have a drink At least have a
goddamn drink

Stebbins stops Not looking at the Captain he takes a
long pull from the flask

STEBBINS
Let Zebulon die in his own
way I’m going back

CAPTAIN
It’s too late for that

STEBBINS
(angry)
Maybe for you Not for me I can
pull out any time I want I’m
just an observer who’s not even
drawing wages

CAPTAIN
You forget that until I came
along you were squatting in your
own provincial stink lost in
third rate fantasies living with
a wife who is by the way a
crashing bore in bed

STEBBINS
(taking another drip)
From what I heard my gallant
friend your performance was
equal to your action on San Juan
hill One brief compulsive dash
over as soon as it began

The Captain stares at him and pulls out his revolver
shoving it into Stebbins’ face

CAPTAIN
Stop Don’t go any farther or
I’11 send you to hell

STEBBINS
Until you do just remember that
you are at the mercy of my imagi-
nation Captain Let us pray that
my imagination can leap over the
facts

CAPTAIN
Such as the woman lying at your
feet

STEBBINS
Yes of course That too

Stebbins turns and walks away

EXT INDIAN VILLAGE - MORNING

Zebulon Sara Big Foot and Ma Davis ride along the
banks of a large estuary flowing into the sea

In front of them just visible through the early morning
mist an array of brightly colored Totem Poles rise over
the dilapidated wooden shacks of a Kwakiutl fishing
village

ON THREE INDIANS

Naked to the waist cleaning salmon laid out on a wooden
fish rack Nearby children throw a cloth ball back and
forth in front of a large sea going canoe At their
feet dogs snarl and snap at each other as they chew on
bones

ON AN OLD WOMAN

Coming out of one of the Shacks staring silently at
them In back of the shack a huge wooden frog sits ona
stone platform near a totem pole with a screaming Raven
on the top flapping its wide wings

The Old Man points down the shore towards the three
Indians cleaning salmon

They ride towards the three Indians who stop what
they’re doing and watch them ride up

Again Zebulon asks for his son

ZEBULON
Be lookin’ for Jason Pike

The three Indians stare at Zebulon with no expression
Finally two of the Indians turn to the third

ON THE THIRD INDIAN

A long haired young man whose chest and arms are covered
with tatoos of Ravens and Sea Demons Even though his
skin is bronzed his eyes are bright BLUE

empty

JASON looks at his mother then at his father

JASON
Got me a wife
(Hesitates)
Injun That’s the short truth of

it
JASON points to a shack down tke beach where a pretty
Indian woman stands looking at them a naked three year
old boy holding on to her legs

JASON

Cloud in the Water That’s our

boy Christmas
A pause as this information sinks in
ON BIG FOOT

Slamming his fist into JASON’s chest trying to knock
him down Jason just stands as he was unmoved

BIG FOOT

Red devils rile me Never could
shake it

An embarrassed silence

BIG FOOT
No offense Jason I was married

Ma Davis shakes her head annoyed at her husband then
spits on the ground

ON ZEBULON

Nodding briefly to Cloud In The Water then walking down
the beach

SARA
(to Jason)
You’d better go after him

Jason calls out in Kwakiutl to Cloud In The Water who
picks up Christmas and disappears into the shack

BIG FOOT
(to Jason)
Go ahead son Your Daddy come
all this way to see you He won’t
be here this time tommorow

Jason shrugs

JASON
My wife will feed you

He turns and walks slowly after his father
EXT BEACH - MORNING
Jason walks up to Zebulon who sits on an overturned
canoe looking out over the sea
Another awkward silence
ZEBULON

I don’t know how to say this
gentle I got a bullet in my

pump

JASON
I ain’t heard from you in seven
years I ain’t sure if I want to
hear it now

Zebulon shrugs still looking at the horizon

ZEBULON
Your choice

Jason fights his emotions Finally he turns to his
father

JASON
I didn’t think I’d ever see you
again

ZEBULON
I broke out

JASON
Are they after you

ZEBULON
They are Only a few whispers
away

JASON

For the first time he looks at Jason

ZEBULON
You got to take me in same as I

JASON
How long will you stay

ZEBULON

ZEBULON
It would be good if you can take
care of your Ma She’1l help your
boy grow up with spirit in hin
Learn to be his own man

JASON
She’s welcome to stay if she
don’t mind livin’ with redskins

ZEBULON
She won’t mind

Zebulon pauses trying to think of something else to
say but nothing comes to hin

Father and son sit together staring at the sea

EXT SHACK - MORNING

As Sara follows Big Foot and Ma Davis into the shack
she turns to stare at the beach

ON ZEBULON AND JASON

Embracing each other

INT SHACK - MORNING
Sara enters the shack

Cloud In The Water has laid out a meal of fish and corn
in the middle of the floor

Around the shack simple furnishings - a wood stove a bear

skin on the wall next to a wooden mask of a fish A
shotgun leaning against the door

SARA
(To Cloud in the Water
as she stands up)
I’m proud to meet you Cloud

MA DAVIS
Did you have a good growing
season dear Put up many cans

Cloud In The Water stares at her not understanding

BIG FOOT
The damned She Devil don’t even
know the Lord’s English

Cloud In The Water points to her mouth then to Sara
Big Foot and Ma Davis Then to the food on the floor

MA DAVIS
But she sure knows how to lay out
a decent feed

As Ma Davis and Big Foot sit down in front of the food
Sara kneels in front of Christmas opening her arms

SARA
Can you give your Granny a kiss

Christmas runs over and jumps on Big Foot’s lap
upsetting his bowl of food When Big Foot tries to pick
up the bowl Christmas laughs and upsets it again this
time dumping the food over his lap

BIG FOOT
The little bastard be as mule
headed and stubborn as his Daddy

MA DAVIS
Not to mention his Grand Daddy

SARA
(to Big Foot)
Even so looks like Jason picked
himself a right healthy girl

BIG FOOT
Well he did

ON JASON AND ZEBULON
Walking into the shack

Zebulon makes the sign of peace to Cloud In The Water
then speaks to her in Kwakiutl

ZEBULON
(In Kwakiutl)
Hello

CLOUD IN THE WATER
(In Kwakiutl1)
Hello

Zebulon sweeps Christmas into his arms hugs him and tickles
him until the Boy cries out in pleasure

Then Zebulon and Jason sit down and begin to eat

EXT COAST - DAY

The Captain pulls up on a wooded knoll overlooking the sea

dozen men left

POKE
He pointed us north rather than
south

BENT

A few hours more or less don’t matter

CAPTAIN
It does if he warned them we’re

The Men look at him wearily Gradually as if in slow
motion they mount up

the opposite direction

ANGLE ON A YOUNG TROOPER”

Looking at the Indians He hesitates then wheels his

walks towards them with drooped head

He passes out
Zebulon mounts his horse

ZEBULON
And Hatchet

SARA
That’s over It would never be

He nods unable to speak Finally he turns to Jason
ZEBULON

(to Jason)
Keep your top knot on

For a brief moment a common silence envelopes them a
recognition

ZEBULON
And don’t forget the damn
mountains

As he starts to ride off Big Foot stands in his way
Then Ma Davis Sara holds on to the reins

Silently the Indians and the Russian Trappers circle
around hin

Zebulon shakes his head Slowly he dismounts

EXT SHORE - DUSK

The Captain Stebbins and the remaining seven Soldiers
sit on their horses on a hill overlooking the Kwakiutl
Village

Below them drums beat Three bonfires burn near the
shore

ON THE SEA

Where a large ocean going Kwakiutl canoe approaches a
large statue of an Eagle on its prow Men women and
children sit inside

Among the shacks people begin to appear

ON THE CAPTAIN

Snapping his spy glass closed the Captain oulines his
plan

CAPTAIN
We’1ll advance upon the settlement
by three separate fronts Bent

circle across the estuary
Simultaneously Poke will take
three men into town from the
west I will lead the principal
column directly into the village

STEBBINS tries to relieve the Captain of his spy glass
but the Captain rebuffs him

STEBBINS
May I congratulate you on a very
traditional and correct strategy
Captain How unfortunate that you
have no men to carry it out
BENT
Hes right sir There aren’t
enough of us
The Captain turns to him abruptly
CAPTAIN
Those are my orders Sergeant
Bent
Bent and the other soldiers look at each other
A Soldier stares at the ground as he speaks

SOLDIER
They ain’t my orders

The Captain whirls around

CAPTAIN
Who said that

Another Solider

2ND SOLDIER
I guess we all gid Captain

ON THE CAPTAIN
As he realizes his men have MUTINIED
ON STEBBINS

Seizing his moment relieving the Captain of his spy
glass

Snapping it open he FOCUSES ON
The Kwakiutl Village
People have gathered in a large circle Nearby pigs are

being roasted over the fires The drums are louder
Chanting can be heard

FURTHER FOCUS
A Cabin A door opens and a young Indian appears -
Jason He is leading Zebulon by a rope tied to his
wrists
They proceed towards the circle of people
STEBBINS
(Barely able to speak)

There he is

ON THE CAPTAIN AND THE TROOPS

Facing each other Hands on their weapons

POKE takes the spy glass from Stebbins’ shaking hands

The moment breaks
STEBBINS

He’s been captured
The moment changes even more

POKE
Tied by the wrists He’s there
Zebulon

ON THE CAPTAIN
Struggling to regain to his authority

CAPTAIN
I suggest that you men fall in
and that we all perform our
necessary duty I am prepared to
overlook what just occured

The men look at each other
BENT

What the hell Fifty bucks is
fifty bucks

One by one the soldiers mount up

EXT ESTUARY - DUSK

The Captain leads his small troop across the shallow
estuary as the sun sinks over the sea

What is left of his men have formed more or less decent
ranks as they ride towards the fires of the Village

Stebbins rides behind

EXT KWAKIUTL VILLAGE - DUSK

It is almost dark as Stebbins the Captain and his Men
enter the Village

Kids are playing in the street Families appear in
doorways °

Little by little a crowd forms around them walking
close to their horses as they approach the circle by the
shore One of them is Big Foot who strokes the mane of
the Captain’s horse Another Indian holds the horse’s
reins

ON ZEBULON

Standing in the center of the circle with Jason at his
side

Gathered around him are Kwakiutl Men Women and Children
as well as the Russian Trappers Ma Davis Sara and
Cloud In The Water

ANGLE ON THE CAPTAIN

Barely noticing the crowd as he stares at Zebulon
Finally he has reached his goal Stiff backed rigidly
fighting for control of his emotions the Captain
presses forward

ON ZEBULON

Hands bound looking calmly up at the Captain The Crowd

pushes closer to the Captain one Indian reaching up to
take off one of his boots

CAPTAIN
By all rights you should be

dead

ZEBULON
I’m aiming to be but not on your
time

CAPTAIN

You’re under arrest I’m going to
take you back and hang you

ON THE CROWD
Pressing closer
ON THE TROOPS

Looking anxious then totally panicked as rifles are
poked into their backs and their weapons removed

ON ZEBULON
Slipping his hands from the rope
ON THE CAPTAIN

Spurring his horse through the Crowd towards Zebulon
drawing his sword

ON POKE ‘

Drawing his pistol aiming it at Zebulon
ON MA DAVIS

Looking down the barrel of a long rifle

She fires Poke falls off his horse shot between the
eyes

Hands reach up and pull the Captain off his horse
He breaks free slashing one Indian across the face

As the Captain reaches for his revolver Zebulon back
hands him across the mouth sending him to the ground

But the effort has cost Zebulon He kneels on the sand
fighting for breath

The Captain watches Zebulon’s face seized in a grimace
of pain He leans forward making a slow move for Poke’s
rifle lying in the sand

But Zebulon sweat pouring off his forehead reaches the
rifle first The Captain holds the barrel but Zebulon
has his finger on the trigger

Neither of them moves

Around them the Crowd watches in silence

ON ZEBULON

Pulling back the rifle With a last effort he swings
the rifle smashing the Captain on the side of the head

The Captain his head bloodied bends over and throws up

They both lay back half dead surrendered to their own
pain Gradually Zebulon breathes easier

ON FOUR TROOPERS

Standing under guard They are all that is left of the
Captain’s command

ON STEBBINS
Tied up In front of him two Kwakiutl teenage girls
Open his satchel Disgusted by the contents they throw
his papers into the wind A third Girl struggles up
holding the typewriter in both Hands
She smashes the typewriter on a rock
ON BIG FOOT AND EBEN
Approaching the Captain and Stebbins

CAPTAIN
(to Eben)

Shoot him Shoot him and be done
with it He shot your woman in
the back The man is the devil

EBEN
Don’t be influencing me Captain
I’m still thinkin’ on it

STEBBINS
You’re all mad The only way you
people can avoid retribution is
if I live to tell the story

ZEBULON stands up He looks at the poor bedraggled
remains of the Captain’s men

ZEBULON
You men ride out of here and
don’t come back
ON THE FOUR TROOPERS
Mounting and riding off
They are followed by a pack of children including
Christmas who yell and throw rocks at them as they
disappear into the darkness
ZEBULON
(looking at Stebbins

and the Captain)
Give these two a front row seat

Zebulon still breathing with difficulty walks away

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Zebulon walks down the beach towards a dilapidated shack
standing off by itself Behind him the drums continue

INT CHINAMAN’S SHACK - NIGHT

Zebulon steps into the shack It is full of clothing
canned goods traps pelts smoked fish etc An old
Chinaman - YIN - sits on a battered sofa reading a
Chinese newspaper He looks up at Zebulon enters

ZEBULON
Hello Yin

YIN
(showing no emotion)
Hello yourself Zebulon
What you doing here

ZEBULON
Family business

YIN
What you want

ZEBULON
The same stuff you gave old
Jack Skidd down in Wind River
The stuff that took him out when
he was gut shot

YIN
Got new stuff Better than old
stuff No pain Just gone But not
for you

ZEBULON
Hell Yin It’s my time to go
Waitin’ ain’t my game

Yin reaches out for Zebulon’s wrist Shutting his eyes
he takes his pulse

YIN
Every man wait You too Zebulon
You got maybe one day maybe thirty
day maybe hundred day Some day you
die Not today Today you breathe

He turns away

Zebulon stares at him then leaves

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Zebulon walks back towards the fires

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Stebbins and the Captain are buried up to their necks in
the sand facing each other

Around them Four Indians have started a slow dance
With flints in their hands they move towards each
other striking sparks and letting out shrill whistles
They wear costumes deer and racoon heads waving and
undulating on long poles headpieces of deer horns
necklaces of shells

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

Further down the beach Zebulon walks towards a row of
canoes pulled up on shore

Slowly he drags a canoe into the water
ON SARA AND CLOUD IN THE WATER
Coming out of the darkness carrying baskets of food

They all stand looking at each other

ZEBULON
Are you all right
SARA
(softly)
Yes
ZEBULON

I’m sorry

SARA
But why are you leaving

ZEBULON
Because I want to look straight
at the misty beyond when it comes
and not have anyone get in my
way Not even my own damn family
I need to be in my own lodge

She touches his cheek unable to look at him

Zebulon gets into the canoe

ZEBULON
One more thing I owe Eben a
horse See that he gets mine

ON SARA AND CLOUD IN THE WATER

Watching him paddle into the darkness

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

The fire Now surrounded by the entire community
Indians Russians Zebulon’s kin

ON THE CAPTAIN AND STEBBINS

Still buried up to their necks Their faces glistening
with sweat as the four Indians now joined by a
Russian Jason and Ma Davis dance around them

ON BIG FOOT

Holding forth a jug in one hand

BIG FOOT

(takes a swig from the jug)
Recollect one winter down on the
Rouge River me and Zeb followed a
wolverine trail for forty days
Been stealin’ from our traps
Wellsir we come up to him and
Zeb and him went at it huggin’
and bitin’ and kickin’ Zeb put
him under right quick Never saw
a man so good at what he did

ON SARA AND CLOUD IN THE WATER

Returning to the fire

No one notices the Canoe as it drifts out to sea

EXT SEA NIGHT

Zebulon lies in the stern of the Canoe He has mounted a
sail in the bow

A gust of wind flaps the canvas as the Canoe glides out
of the estuary and sails out to sea

ANGLE ON THE BEACH

Where the fires are now only small points of light
DISSOLVE TO

EXT BEACH -— EARLY MORNING

The first light of dawn The beach is nearly deserted
except for a few figures still asleep on the sand

Stebbins and the Captain have been dug out Shivering in
the early morning chill they walk towards a horse
watched by Jason and several Indians

Stebbins mounts the horse The Captain climbs up behind
hin

Together they walk the horse slowly down the beach

EXT BEACH - EARLY MORNING
Stebbins and the Captain disappear into the forest as
The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL

The vast solitary Ocean
