contentedly beside him as he responds happily to back and
shoulder pats handshakes hugs and general ad-lib congratula-

subject
(bracing

Is it possible

Finney hesitates then starts down the stairs again and
taking a quick breath Richard follows

PINNEY
Two Englishwomen thought so in
August 1901 Misses Moberly and
Jourdain Deans of ladies schools
Tll have you know not idiots by
any means Claimed to have walked
pack to the year 1789 in the Gardens
of Versailles Seen Marie Antoinette
celebrating her 34th birthday They
drew sketches of what theyd seen
but no one was ever really convinced
For one thing they wrote down music
they claimed to have heard but experts
said that no such music was ever
played at that time

RICHARD
(discouraged)
It isnt certain then

FINNEY
Wellconsider this Just recently
in Paris some music manuscript was
found It had been composed for
Marie Antoinettes 34th birthday
and played only on that day

PINNEY

t was in Venice in 1971 staying in
a very old hotel but I mean very
old the structure the furnishings
everything The atmosphere was
aged if you follow me In my room
i felt as though it was a century
or more earlier than 1971 you
understand

RICHARD
The location is important

FINNEY

Not all important but essential

asked myself if I attempt to hypno-

actually Actually i571

RICHARD
(eagerly)
Did you do it

FINNEY

I closed my eyes and fed a sugges

tion into my brain Its August
1571 Im in the Hotel Del Vecchio
I spelled out details for myself
kept doing it over and over August
1571 the hotel the details of the
past Again and again and again

It was imperfect granted How

so excited he can hardly function He picks up the coins and

separates them and puts the 1900s coins in the vest pocket
again grimacing His excited anticipation is not to be
repressed however as he takes the watch off the table and
starts to put it in his vest pocket almost dropping it He
grimaces flinching then grinning puts the watch in his

He reaches the door and turns the knob to open it The door
is locked Further the only way to open it is with a
skeleton key which isnt there Richard looks at the door
appalled He turns the knob again in vain groans softly
This is too much He looks around haplessly Then he whirls

one is inserting a skeleton key into it

ending with a realization of loss a last hope overpowered
How this happens we do not know at the moment but we see it
happen in Robinsons expression He reacts to this atypically

with the capacity to surpass Bernhardt
as the stars surpass the moon A
stage performer with such qualities
as I have never seen in any actress
in the twenty-seven years that I
have managed As innate ability to
wrench emotional adulation from
