UNDER RELIGIOUS CHOIR MUSIC
EXT CHURCH LETTERBOARD SIGN - DAY

An old wooden sign in front of an equally old but sturdy
salt of the earth church with a towering steeple This is the
GRACE BAPTIST CHURCH of Gatlin Nebraska and the sign
proclaims the topic of todays sermon CORN DROUGHT AND THE
LORD

CAMERA PANS

As the choir music continues picking up the DOORS TO THE
CHURCH as they open to allow the CONGREGATION to exit

ANGLE - A CHILDS POV

We see only the legs of pants and hems of dresses from this
little persons perspective The parishioners are in their
Sunday clothes We dont see the upper bodies or faces
OVER THIS SHOT we hear

JOB (VO)
I dont remember everything that
happened cuz I was only five then
and now Im eight

ANGLE - THE CHURCH ENTRANCE

An adorable little boy of about five his hand firmly in the
grasp of an adults hand is led out of the church This is
JOB and he is dressed appropriately for worship He comes up
to his fathers waist and this is all we see of the father
and the MINISTER in front of whom the father stops for a
BEAT Job stands there looking around while his father
apparently talks with the minister Legs continue to file out
past them

JOB (VO)
I was about the only kid in church
that day on account of all the
other kids had been excused to go
listen to Isaac who was this boy
preacher whod come to Gatlin a few
days before

ANGLE - JOB

AN ADULT also whom we only see from the WAIST DOWN bangs
into Job who goes flying but doesnt fall because the
strong hand of his father hangs on to him and lifts him into
the air setting him back down in place again

THE HAND of THE MAN WHO BUMPED HIM gives Job a vigorous but
apologetic rub across the hair

JOB (VO)
Sarah was home sick with mom Dad
decided to take me so he could talk
about the drought with some of the
other men Thats all everybody was
talking about then the drought

ANGLE

Father finishes his brief conversation with the minister and
starts down the steps with Job Its hard for little Job to
keep up with his dad and hes constantly whisked off his feet
whenever he lags too far behind

INT HANSENS COFFEE SHOP - JOBS POV

The door is pushed open by the unseen hand of his father and
Job is led into the coffee shop Hansens is a small
comfortable homey place that caters strictly to the locals
The furnishings are modest but everything is clean and neat
Booths with red vinyl cushioning line the walls and the floor
holds eight or ten tables There are also stools at the
Formica counter behind which MR and MRS HANSEN work
busily

ANGLE

The coffee shop is crowded mostly with ADULTS but also with
A HALF DOZEN BOYS between the ages of 15 and 18 The two
waitresses SALLY and MARIE HANSEN are about 17 They are
being kept quite busy

ANGLE

Four of the boys are crowded around a video MACHINE Theyre
keeping very much to themselves

ANGLE

Jobs father lifts him onto a stool at the counter and walks
towards the PAY PHONE

JOB (VO)
Dad was worried about Sarah so he
went over to the phone as soon as
we got in
ANGLE

CAMERA FOLLOWS JOBS FATHER as he walks across the room to
the pay phone We never see him fully only the fact that he
is very average and non-descript

As he passes the four boys at the machine one of them looks
up and follows him with his eyes This is WILLIAM RENFREW

JOB (VO)
There were some other kids there
I thought they were all in the corn
with Isaac Billy Renfrew looked at
my dad then smiled at me kinda
funny

ANGLE - RENFREW - JOBS POV

After studying Jobs father for a beat he turns his gaze on
Job and smiles in a malignant leering way

ANGLE - JOB

He averts his eyes quickly and spins on the stool so he wont
have to return the older boys look

JOB (VO)
Dad sure was taking a long time

A STRAWBERRY SHAKE is set down with a loud bang by kindly Mr
Hansen who smiles at how startled Job is by the noise Job
glances up at him fearfully

tossing and turning in bed Her face is feverish and flushed

with her husband Job and Sarahs father Semi-conscious in
her fever Sarah spills a box of CRAYONS and clutches a BLACK
one Without looking she begins scrawling on a piece of
MANILA PAPER
QUICK SHOT - THE PAPER

What shes drawing is not yet discernible just a patch of
black in the middle of the page

INT COFFEE SHOP

Job is sucking with all his might on a straw protruding from
the strawberry shake He glances towards his father
Something catches his eyes and causes him to FREEZE

EXT THRU FRONT WINDOW - JOBS POV - DAY

Thru the window beyond his father beyond the boys by the
Pac Man machine stands ISAAC A gaunt boy of 12 he has a
face right out of the Old Testament and eyes that burn like
coal He is dressed in black robes and a wide-brimmed hat He
is staring into - through -the coffee shop

INT COFFEE SHOP

The straw slips out of Jobs mouth He is frightened to death
of the vision before him but he cant take his eyes off of
Isaac Few if any of the adults in the room take notice
but the boys by the Pac Man do

They turn and scan the room full of adults

SALLY AND MARIE

Look at the boys conspiratorially

Isaac
SEVERAL ADULTS

All of whom have been drinking coffee begin to gag and
choke They lurch forward out of their seats gasping for
breath as they fall

Job

JOBS FATHER

tries to pull A BOY off an ELDERLY WOMAN He grabs the youth
from behind but barely gets his hands on him when A HAND
HOLDING A SCREWDRIVER plummets INTO FRAME and into his back

JOB

screams but nothing comes out It is a scream from the
deepest part of his being and it is silent Mr Hansen s
blood is still sprayed across his face

WIDE ANGLE

The interior of the coffee shop has turned into a scene of
complete carnage with all of the adults who are still alive
being either cut down or finished off by the Children Of The
Corn Chairs and tables are over-turned dishes and glasses
broken all over the floor and blood everywhere
EXT THE COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Isaac standing fixed in place is gradually encircled by his
devoted followers CHILDREN from four to 19 gather around

fresh blood Like him they face the coffee shop and wait

THE PICTURE -— CLOSE-UP

It shows stick figure representations of Isaac surrounded by
the other children facing Malachai Behind Malachai is a
large splotch of bright red where the coffee shop would be

Vicky is about Burts age wearing a sexy flimsy nightgown
and a party hat She throws her arms around her frightened
lover

VICKY
Happy birthday darling

Shes giggling mischievously over the fright her little
surprise has caused him and assuages any damage done with a
seductive kiss Burts heart rate begins a slow descent
towards normal as Vicky hands him a SHEET OF PAPER rolled
into a scroll and wrapped in tissue with a ribbon around it

VICKY
Present number one

Burt laughs self-consciously and takes the paper He unwraps
and unrolls it and looks at what it is

rectangular box

BARRY WHITE singing LOVE DOCTOR begins to play Vicky
silently mouths the words in a wonderfully ridiculous
caricature Burt starts laughing and Vicky cant keep a

CANDLE lighted sticks out of the muffin

ANGLE

Forgetting hes wearing only his under shorts Burt opens the
door and faces the bell girl She makes no move to enter but
instead starts singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY

BURT

Is obviously attracted to her almost to the exclusion of
Vicky who arranged the whole thing He stares at the young
woman waiting for her to finish

ANGLE - INCLUDING VICKY

When the bell girl does finish Burt is beside himself
looking for a couple of dollars to give her as a tip Vicky
watches as he fumbles through his pants pockets the bell
girl not completely oblivious to his attentions

Watches quietly as he hands the woman the tip There is a
hurt knowing expression on her (Vickys) face

She gives him a slightly grin which he smiles at The
tension evaporates Burt reaches across the seat and hugs her
to him driving with one hand

BURT
I know what youre thinking You

cornfields

CUT TO
EXT GATLIN NEBRASKA —- DAY

We have seen glimpses of Gatlin before but things now -
three years later - are far more tranquil and idyllic It is
just a tiny farm community not even on the map out in the
middle of nowhere Like everything else in this state it is
surrounded by cornfields

A BARN

stands at the edge of where the cornfield meets the town
Three children are hiding behind it pressed against the
side They are Job and Sarah whom weve met and JOSEPH who
is much older and larger at 14 All three are dressed in
black cloth clothes of simple design not unlike the Amish or
Mennonites Joseph has a suitcase with him and appears
extremely nervous to the point of desperation As CAMERA
MOVES IN SLOWLY we hear JOBS CONTINUING VOICE OVER

JOB

He punctuates his conversation with constant glances towards
the town and more particularly the corn Job picks up on
this

JOB

This apparently bodes ill Joseph swallows hard and looks
out over the field

ANGLE - THE CORNFIELD - JOSEPHS POV

JOB

JOSEPH

JOB AND SARAH

nod in agreement like two good little soldiers They cross
their hearts with their fingers and then motion as if
sticking something in their eyes It is a childrens oath
taken in the way of children - with the utmost solemnity and
sincerity

THREE SHOT

JOSEPH
Okay You know what that means If
you tell youre gonna burn on the
lake of fire for all eternity

Their eyes widen in fear at the prospect Joseph turns his
attention to the cornfield Hes sweating profusely

JOSEPH
Make sure nobodys looking

ANGLE
Job and Sarah race to the town side of the barn and look

cautiously around Simultaneously they shout back to Joseph
at the tops of their lungs

JOB AND SARAH
OKAY

ANGLE - JOSEPH

He cringes at the volume and rolls his eyes in disbelief One
deep breath and hes off into the corn

ANGLE - JOB AND SARAH
They stand there watching disappointedly as their friend
makes good his escape They remain fixed frightened and
silent

CUT TO
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
A long flat straight strip of black tape separating a sea
of golden-tipped green corn on either side There is
something alien remote about this landscape A DOT appears
in the distance growing larger

She flips the knob and a PREACHERS VOICE fills the car

PREACHER (VO)
Hallelujah

BURT AND VICKY

BURT

CUT TO
EXT CORNFIELD - DAY
Joseph is running scared through the corn He struggles
against the thick unyielding stalks and is sweating and
breathing heavily He stops every few yards to listen for
sounds of pursuit and also to get his orientation
ANGLE
He stops changes direction stops again and looks up at the
sun He is lost and fighting against his panic The corn
begins to RUSTLE ominously Joseph does an abrupt about face
and runs face first into a heavy ear It thuds against his
cheek raising a welt

CUT TO
EXT THUNDERBIRD - DAY
It continues to run the steady gauntlet of corn

ANGLE

CAMERA IS LOOKING OUT FROM the cornfield as if the plants
themselves were watching The car goes by

ANGLE - HEAD ON

With the approaching vehicle It abruptly slows down and
pulls over onto the narrow shoulder that separates the
asphalt from the corn There is a claustrophobic sense about
proximity of the stalks Burt’s door opens

INT CAREXT ROAD — DAY

Burt gets out Vicky remains inside but the windows are open

VICKY
What are you doing

BURT
Corn looks a little dry

VICKY
Can I watch

BURT
Better not It leads to insanity

He walks up to the wall of corn Its imposing and it stops
him

VICKY
Thats okay Im crazy about you
anyway

Burt is transfixed by the corn He doesnt respond or even
turn around

VICKY
Burt Is anything wrong

That snaps him out of it He looks back at her and smiles

BURT
No Be back in a sec

He starts to go into the field
ANGLE
The corn rustles ever so slightly in front of him but there
is no breeze Burt stops like hes just walked into a wall
of glass
BURT
(to Vicky)
Did you see that

ANGLE - INCLUDING VICKY

Shes still in the car leaning out the window

VICKY
No What
A beat
BURT
I guess it was nothing
VICKY
Oh boy Somebodys been in the car
too long
BURT

(not convinced)
Yeah

With a hint of apprehension he submerges into the field It
swallows him instantly

CUT TO
EXT CORNFIELD - ANOTHER-SECTION —- DAY

Joseph is utterly terrified Hes moving quickly through the
corn suitcase in hand like someone who knows hes being
followed He hears what sounds like giggling up in front of
him He runs to the side but is stopped by DELIBERATE and
TAUNTING NOISES in that direction The SOUNDS ARE GLEEFUL
and seem to be made by children Joseph turns again and
again but every-time is stopped A circle is closing around
him He is trapped and covered with parts of corn plants

CUT TO
EXT THE THUNDERBIRD - DAY

Vicky gets out of the car and walks towards the corn

VICKY
Burt Are you alright
Nothing
VICKY
Say something Anything Im all
ears
(beat)
Burt that was supposed to be
funny

The only answer is a SOFT RUSTLING SOUND from the
impenetrable field Its almost like a whisper and it
spooks Vicky a little

ANGLE - BURT

is standing in the corn listening to that rustling Something
touches his shoulder and he whips around A CORNSTALK is
leaning on him As he shoves it aside A CORN LEAF pokes his
neck Burt is starting to get agitated He begins to RUN

CUT TO
EXT CORNFIELD — ANOTHER SECTION — DAY
Joseph is running also but now with a sense of futility
His direction changes constantly and his terror is even

greater than before He trips over an ear of corn and falls
down

Before he can get up A HAND ENTERS THE FRAME and grabs him
by the shoulder Joseph utters a squeak of fright the sound
of a bird caught in a hunters snare

CUT TO
EXT CORNFIELD — ANOTHER SECTION — DAY

Burt is still running The corn seems to be rustling all
around him but that might be from the commotion hes making
He shoves ears and stalks and leaves out of his way
frantically SUDDENLY

ANGLE

Vicky crashes into him from the blind side He grabs
violently in a reflex reaction

VICKY
Well if this is how it affects
you we’ll have to come here more
often

Burt stares at her catching his breath He continues
clutching her shoulders

BURT
Vicky

VICKY
You were expecting maybe Jaqueline
Bisset

Burt wraps his arms around her It is at once a gesture of
relief friendship protectiveness and sensuality

VICKY
I knew you were kinky

BURT
Let’s get out of here

VICKY
Why Things are starting to get
interesting

(beat)
You alright

BURT
I just got turned around a little
But let’s go

VICKY
(reluctant)
Okay

He starts to guide her straight ahead She pushes him on an
angle

VICKY
That way

They exit the cornfield

ANGLE — THE THUNDERBIRD

Burt and Vicky emerge from the cornfield and get into the
car Just before Burt ducks into the drivers side he give
the corn a long last look

THE CORN - BURTS POV

It is silent and still

ANGLE

Burt gets in and the T-bird drives away

THE CORN
Begins to rustle quietly

CUT TO
EXT A CLEARING IN THE CORNFIELD — DAY

Joseph is flat on his back panting and struggling trying to
get away from Malachai who has pinned him to the ground with
a knee and an arm Others must be holding Joseph by the feet
from the way hes stretched out Corn silk is plastered to
his neck and face glued there by the sweat

ANGLE
A CIRCLE OF CHILDREN tightens around Joseph They begin
humming in an eerie atonal way A HAND grips Josephs hair
and jerks his head back The boys eyes widen a look of
sheer terror coming over him Malachai raises a cornhusker’s
knife over him The humming increases in intensity

CUT TO
INT CAR

Safe within the car Burt and Vicky have calmed down
considerably

BURT
I dont know what came over me I
never had claustrophobia before

VICKY
Maybe it was just cornophobia

BURT
It sure could’ve been that I’m
even ready to get back on the

highway

VICKY
I think it wasn’t too far on the
map

EXT THUNDERBIRD - DAY

CAMERA TRACKS the car as it slams past us from right to left
It passes another old SIGN

ANGLE - SIGN

In the shape of an arrow and made of rotting wood It reads
GATLIN

CUT TO
EXT CORNFIELD — DAY

Joseph is staggering TOWARDS THE CAMERA which is PULLING
BACK KEEPING PACE His eyes are blank and bulging His
hands are up to his throat and blood is flowing through his
fingers bright and sparkling The front of his shirt is
sodden with the red fluid In effect hes dead on his feet
Hes heading out of the cornfield although he doesnt know
it Behind him we see a trail of twisted broken corn plants
with blood splashed on them In the far background is
Josephs SUITCASE

CUT TO
INT CAR
Vicky is fishing through the glove compartment looking for
the map She has PAPERS TISSUES HAND-WIPES A COMB THE
CAR REGISTRATION everything in her hand but the map

DRIED KETCHUP stains the front

She begins unfolding it across the dash She studies Burt
with a knowing smile

VICKY
I wonder how it got in there

EXT CORNFIELD — DAY

Joseph reeling like a drunk comes to the edge of the
cornfield He looks inhuman like a macabre doll

CUT TO
INT CAR

Vicky and Burt are studying the map which partially obscures
their view through the windshield Vicky is pointing

VICKY
You see This way goes to Grand
Island and this looks like it cuts
out towards the highway

the onrushing car His hands are still at his throat and his
knees are already buckling

VICKY
BURT LOOK OUT

Burt jerks his head up sees the boy hits the brakes and
goes into a swerve all in one motion

BURT
JESUS

EXT ROAD —- DAY

Everything happens extremely fast Amidst the sound of
screeching tires and brakes the T-bird begins to skid
Theres a loud THUMP as it strikes Josephs body which was
crumpling even before impact

ANGLE

The car continues to skid and we cant see whether it
actually runs over the body or just hits it but we can see
that its in grave danger of overturning

INT CAR

Burt is fighting the wheel The tires are still screeching
Vicky is one long piercing scream As the car comes to a
shuddering quivering halt she is thrown face first into the
windshield Burt wearing his seatbelt goes forward and back
sharply Theres silence except for the sound of the idling
motor

ANGLE

Burt moves quickly He rips off his seatbelt and cradles
Vicky in his arms examining the nasty bruise that has
already formed on her cheekbone

BURT
Are you alright Can you feel my
hand

Vicky hasnt really composed herself yet Shes whimpering
softly Burt runs his hand over her face

BURT
Theres a contusion and swelling
It doesnt feel like anything’s
broken

VICKY
That was an animal right Burt
Please tell me it was an animal

Burt suddenly remembers the boy
BURT

Ive got to go back there You

stay here and sit quietly Dont

move
ANGLE - REAR VIEW MIRROR - BURTS POV
Burt knows it was no animal he hit He stares at the heap
lying in the road about 100 feet back that is reflected in
the mirror He prays silently for a sign of movement but
there is none
ANGLE
Burt gathers himself quickly and bolts from the car
EXT ROAD - DAY
Josephs body lies face down turned away from Burt who
kneels beside it He puts his hand to the boys neck feeling
for a pulse and is confused when he withdraws his hand
ANGLE - BURTS HAND
Its covered with blood
ANGLE
Burt turns the body over It flops boneless lifelessly on
its back The eyes are open and we can see very plainly that
Josephs throat has been cut from ear to ear
ANGLE - TWO SHOT
Burt grimaces and loses his breath for a beat Then he

closes Josephs eyes - a deeply tender gesture - and makes a
momentary calculation Vickys voice interrupts

ANGLE
Vicky turns away suddenly and gags Burt rushes to her

VICKY
Oh my God

Burt comforts her and starts leading her back to the car

BURT
Vick theres something terribly
wrong here I want you to get in
the car and wait for me and keep
the doors locked no matter what

VICKY
Why What are you going to do

BURT

he is

VICKY
No Where are you going

They reach the car Burt opens the door for her

BURT
I have to get the body And I want
to look at something

VICKY

She debates for a beat then slips into the car She is
terribly shaken and pale

things to make room He takes out a
BLANKET then turns and looks back
at the body and also takes out a
TIRE IRON

ANGLE - THROUGH THE CORN - MALACHAIS POV
Although we dont see who it is at first someone watches as

Burt goes back to the body and gently covers it with the
blanket

ANGLE - BURT

Walks over to the mangled portion of the cornfield where
Joseph exited He studies the twisted broken and blood-
covered stalks All of his senses are alert

THE CORNFIELD - BURTS POV

Deep in he spots Josephs suitcase

ANGLE

Burt makes a decision He checks the car looks all around
and finally tentatively walks into the corn-field

INT CAR - VICKYS POV - INCLUDING VICKY

Vicky is in shock resting dazedly in the front seat Her
head is back against the headrest and her eyes are closed
Shes sobbing softly

If her eyes were open she would see Malachai emerge from the
corn about 50 feet ahead She would see him pause the bloody
cornhuskers knife still in his hand and then approach the
car She doesnt see this BUT WE DO

EXT CORNFIELD - BURT - DAY
He is moving carefully alertly through this jungle He

holds the tire iron ready and turns in every direction as he
moves forward The suitcase is just up ahead in a clearing

INT CAREXT ROAD - VICKYS POV - INCLUDING VICKY

Vicky comes out of her stupor and looks through the
windshield She sees Malachai standing in front of the car
with his malignant stare VICKY SCREAMS and lunges for the
car horn She pounds on it frantically looking behind her
for any sign of Burt then whips around to see that Malachai
is gone

EXT CORNFIELD - BURT - DAY

He is kneeling by the suitcase HE HEARS THE CAR HORN but
doesnt respond immediately perhaps thinking she is just
getting impatient The suitcase is in a clearing There is
much blood here still fresh The suitcase is splattered with
it Suddenly the corn begins to rustle in that weird way
again Burt looks up at the towering stalks They seem to
be closing in on him

EXT CAR — DAY

Vicky is unglued She gets out of the car near hysteria
She begins to walk back towards the body

VICKY
Burt Burt where are you

WIDE ANGLE - VICKYS POV

There is no sign of Burt No sign of Malachai either In
fact there is no sign of anyone or anything other than that
endless ubiquitous corn and the blanket covered body lying
stubbornly in the middle of the road

ANGLE

Vicky approaches the body She cups her hands to her mouth
and begins to cry She is unable to take her eyes off of it
She kneels next to it

VICKY
(to body)
You poor thing You poor dear boy

And suddenly violently Joseph lurches up causing the
blanket to fall away from his hideous blood drenched body
and deathly white face He reaches for Vickys neck She
screams and jumps back continuing to scream and back peddle
until

ANGLE

Someone grabs her from behind and she whirls with a start
finding herself face to face with Burt She aborts another
scream when she sees who it is

BURT
Vicky

She stares at him all the trauma beginning to be too much
for her Burt realizes this He puts down the suitcase and
shakes her

BURT
VICKY VICKY Get a hold on
yourself

She flings herself at him Burt holds her closely
VICKY

Oh Burt Whered you go I
kneeled down next to

She suddenly remembers and whips around

JOSEPHS BODY - BURT and VICKYS POV

It remains how and where it has been The blanket covers it
TWO SHOT

Vicky looks at Burt again genuine confusion in her eyes

VICKY
He sat up He tried to grab me

BURT
(gentle compassionate)
Its alright Everythings going to
be alright Im here now

But the look on his face tells us he isnt quite convinced
himself He hands Vicky the suitcase

BURT
Take this Come on we’ll go back
to the car I’ve got to get the
body

VICKY
Don’t go-leave him

ANGLE

Vicky takes the suitcase Burt goes to the body securing the
blanket under it They walk grimly to the car

ANGLE

Vicky waits while Burt puts the body in the trunk along
with the tire iron which hes had tucked into his belt
Vicky hands him the suitcase in the front seat He and Vicky
get in quickly

ANGLE

As the t-bird accelerates down the road dwindling out of
sight Malachai steps out of the cornfield He stares after

the car

CUT TO

EXT HOUSE - GATLIN - DAY

Establishing shot An American Gothic like many of the
houses in Gatlin CAMERA ZOOMS IN SLOWLY to an open window
We hear Jobs VO NARRATION

JOB (VO)
Me and Sarah were playing We
played lots Malachai said it was
forbidden but I think it was cuz
nobody liked to play with him
anyway

INT BEDROOM

Job and Sarah are playing MONOPOLY Theyre dressed to the
hilt in the clothes of some former adult residents The
clothes are far too large and the garnishing far too
elaborate which make them perfect for these two hams Job is
swimming in a suit and tie outfit complete with hat pipe and
a handkerchief in the pocket He looks absolutely dashing
Sarah is in a glittering gown also a hat jewelry and lots
of makeup A small battery-powered record player is grinding
out TONY BENNET’S “I LEFT MY HEART IN SAN FRANCISCO” next to
them On the floor by Sarah is a piece of manila drawing
paper and a bunch of crayons As they play

JOB
When I grow up Im gonna have all
the money in the world

SARAH
Me too

JOB
You cant

SARAH
Why not

JOB
Cuz Im gonna have it

SARAH
Ill get it first

JOB
Will not

SARAH

Will too

JOB
Oh yeah How

Sarah PLACES A HOTEL ON BOARDWALK Jobs face registers
shock and dismay but Sarah is well within her rights He
picks up the dice and counts A SEVEN will land him on the
dreaded Boardwalk He jiggles the dice and throws them

ANGLE - THE DICE

A seven

ANGLE

Sarah giggles deliriously while Job counts off the spaces
with his piece THE COWBOY ON HORSEBACK He purposely
miscounts and places his player on GO Sarah catches him
immediately She moves the piece back to its rightful place -

on Boardwalk

SARAH
Uh-uh Job

JOB
How much is it

SARAH
Thirteen thousand hundred dollars

She puts out her hand for the payoff Job gives her twenty
and some ones Still its painful for him to have to pay
anything least of all to her He covers this up with a
childs ploy diversion He grabs the piece on Boardwalk

JOB
Lets pretend this is Isaac

ANGLE

He places the piece on the board four spaces from the GO TO
JAIL spot and throws the dice

ANGLE - THE DICE

They total 11

ANGLE

Job quickly reaches down and changes the numbers so they come

out to 4 He and Sarah squeal with delight as Isaac is
trudged off to jail

SARAH
What if he gets a Get Out Of Jail
Free card

Job quickly fans through the pile of CHANGE CARDS and
extracts all of the GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARDS He tosses
them over his shoulder

JOB
What cards

Theyre laughing and giggling at this when their fun is
abruptly halted by a LOUD BANG

ANGLE - JOB AND SARAH

They look towards the door at the same time There is fear
in their expressions

ANGLE - MALACHAI - THEIR POV

Malachai stands there glaring at them having slammed the
butt end of his knife into the doorframe to get their
attention

CUT TO
INT CAR

Aftershock Burt is driving Very fast Vicky is still
reeling from the imagined () encounter with Joseph She is
becoming hysterical again

VICKY
and then he sat up and tried to
grab me and I could seeOh
Godit looked like his throat had
been cut

BURT
You must have taken the blanket off
and looked at him

VICKY
I didn’t Why are you insisting
that

BURT

Vicky you must have Otherwise how
could you know When I got there
the blanket was covering him

VICKY
How could I know what

Burt realizes he’s given something away and now he has to
tell her what happened He doesn’t know how to say it

BURT
Uh Umm About his throat
VICKY
What do you mean What are you
saying
BURT

How could you know that his throat
was cut unless you lifted the
blanket and looked

He’s beginning to wonder that himself Could Joseph have
risen up the way she described It’s too farfetched for Burt
but it chills him Vicky is horrified

VICKY
Then it’s true He did

BURT
Don’t do it Vicky Don’t even
think it You’ve had a traumatic
experience You’re in shock Now
you’ve got to get a grip on
yourself

VICKY
(ignoring him)
But how could getting hit by a
car

BURT
It didn’t

He looks at her grimly allowing her to figure out for
herself just how the boy died

CUT TO
INT HOUSE

It is very dark Light filters in only through partially
drawn curtains The furnishings are sparse austere but of
good quality There are religious artifacts all about most
of a conspicuously pagan nature knives scythes symbols
hewn from corn plants crosses and in the middle of all this
sits Isaac

He is less frightening now in this quietude almost
scholarly He is writing something by the light of a single
shaft of sun that penetrates the room One gets the feeling
Isaac is a holy man

ANGLE

Malachai enters with Job and Sarah still dressed in their
comical outfits Isaacs and Malachais clothes are in stark
contrast - the simple black cloth weve seen before
Malachai salutes his leader with a touch of the knife to his
forehead It is a pagan barbarian gesture

MALACHAT
I found these two in one of the old
houses They had a game and
music and this

He hands THE SHEET OF MANILA PAPER that was next to Sarah
over to Isaac

ANGLE - THE DRAWING - ISAACS POV

Not a bad likeness of the thunderbird Burt and Vicky
unmistakable are standing next to it

ANGLE

Isaac stares at the picture for what seems like a long time
Meditatively Reflecting

ISAAC
They came already

He looks at Sarah with a hint of warmth

ISAAC
You have the gift of sight child
This is a blessing

Sarah doesnt reply She and Job are scared out of their
wits

MALACHAT
I have seen this car upon the road

ISAAC
Go to the old man Make sure he
tells them nothing

MALACHAT
What about these two

Sarah and Job stand absolutely rigid at attention Maybe if
they dont catch anybodys eyes their worst fears wont be
fulfilled Isaac decides their fate

ISAAC
(calmly)
Take them back where they were

MALACHAT
But they had music And a game
These things are forbidden

ISAAC
Question me not Malachai I act
according to his will

Malachai withers under the reproach He bows his head
reverently touches the deadly blade to it and then turns on
Job and Sarah with that killing gaze

CUT TO
INT CAR

Burt and Vicky are trying to make some sense of it all
Josephs suitcase is on the seat between them

VICKY
But why Why would anybody do that
to aa kid

BURT
He wasn’t that young About 18 Id
say

VICKY

Could it have been an accident
Some kind of farm machine maybe

BURT
Not a wound like that His throat
was cut ear to ear That was
deliberate He was already dead
when Iwhen he stumbled into the
road

VICKY
Whoever killed himdo you think
he saw us

Burt doesnt answer
VICKY
I felt like we were being watched

BURT
Possibly Blood starts to
coagulate in four minutes and the
blood on the corn even on the
suitcase was still fresh by the
time I got to it

VICKY
Then the murderer might have been
in there when youDidnt you
realize

BURT
I couldnt leave it there
Besides I thought it might hold
some clue

VICKY
Lets open it

BURT
No Lets just get to a phone Or a
house Or something for Gods
sakes Even a trucker with a CB

VICKY
Funny how we havent seen another
car or truck

BURT
We should be hitting this place
Gatlin pretty soon

VICKY
I wonder if he lived there

BURT
We may never know

VICKY
Id like to know I think we have a
right to know In fact maybe we
ought to

Burt looks down at the suitcase

BURT
I guess it wont hurt to look

Vicky immediately turns it around so that the locks are
facing her She reacts to all the blood

VICKY
Yech

Burt reaches for the radio

BURT
Maybe we can get some news

He hits the button just as Vicky gets the latches unlatched
and starts to open the suitcase Suddenly

RADIO PREACHER (VO)
ATONEMENT

Burt and Vicky both jump The lid of the suitcase drops
shut

RADIO PREACHER (VO)
Only by the blood of the lamb are
we saved I Only by His watchful eye
are we kept from the sins of the
world

Burt turns the radio off with a punch He shouts to the air

BURT
I have enough of this shit

VICKY

And does it get into the corn

Vicky fishes through the suitcase reaching underneath the
top layer of CLOTHES She finds something and recoils in
fright

VICKY
Oh my God

BURT
What is it

She extracts and holds up for him to see A CORNCOB CRUCIFIX
THE CHRIST FIGURE is done in raised relief the kernels
around it having been picked out The cob has been cut in
half lengthwise and notched at the top into a cross Itsa
monstrous corruption

BURT
Jesus

VICKY
Not in my book

BURT
Thats an authentic American
Primitive

VICKY
I think its repulsive

Burts eye catches something up ahead

BURT
Hallelujah

EXT GAS STATION - BURTS POV - DAY

A VERY OLD MOBIL STATION attested by the fact that the sign
out front bears the ancient RED PEGASUS LOGO and accompanying
FLYING A There are two ANTIQUATED PUMPS on the island and

a THIRD PUMP near the station house for DIESEL

ANGLE

The t-bird turns into the station just in front of where the
main road veers off to the right and a SECONDARY ROAD juts
off to the left The secondary road is rutted and only two
lanes so that cars going opposite ways would have to creep
past each other

INT CAR

Burt drives over to where CHESTER DIEHL is working on a 63
CHEVY PICK-UP

BURT
(the crucifix)
Better put that away No need to
involve this guy

Vicky nods gravely in agreement Burt touches her cheek
gently

BURT
Everything11 be alright

The look in her eyes wants to believe him and almost does
Burt exits the car

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Chester withdraws from the bowels of the pick-up Hes in his
late 60s slow-moving and looks like an old prospector His
bib overalls are stained with grease and his eyes are
magnified tremendously by his thick glasses He walks
towards Burt So does SARGE an old HOUND DOG who barks a
friendly greeting and jumps up on Burt The dogs tail is
wagging

DIEHL
At ease Sarge Maybe he dont want
no beer

ANGLE

Sarges collar has a cold can of OLD MILWAUKEE BEER attached
to it where a Saint Bernard would have a keg The dog backs
off at Diehls command Burt pets him

BURT
Next time Sarge
(to Diehl)

Diehl starts to reply but Burt knows whats coming and beats
him to it

BURT
Dont got no phone

ANGLE

Burt looks to Vicky Burt sighs heavily Diehl takes a
closer look at the stranger Diehl squeals at Burt

ANGLE - BURT - DIEHLS POV

He sees the flecks of dried blood on Burts hands and
clothes

ANGLE - THE CORN

Cornfields surround the gas station The stalks begin to
rustle and sway as if a wind or force were in them This
force is threatening and immensely powerful

ANGLE - GAS STATION

Sarge picks up on this presence His ears prick up and he
growls deeply This signals a change in Chester Diehl He
studies the dog for a moment then seems to be anxious about
something although Burt cant quite figure out what Maybe
its just that he starts to move faster He gives Burt a
cover-up smile

DIEHL
Sarge you be still now In fact
why dont you go give that nice
lady a Coke

Reluctant and whining Sarge trots back towards the station
house Diehl turns his attention to Burt He points to the
fork in the road

DIEHL
What you wanna do is go to
Hemingford Mister About 19 miles
down the right fork here Can’t
miss it

BURT
What about Gatlin

DIEHL
Aint nothin’ in Gatlin
(mutters )

DIEHL(contd)
(normal)

Hemingford

INT CAR

Vicky is watching the men Sarge POPS UP by her window
scaring the breath out of her He is slobbering over a can of
COKE that he holds in his mouth He drops it in her lap She
pats him on the head

VICKY
Thanks fella

EXT CORNFIELD — DAY

Whatever the hell is moving the corn around like that seems
to be getting closer to the station The sky seems to darken
and an eerie wind picks up

ANGLE - FAVORING SARGE

He still has his paws up on the car but is sniffing the air
wildly He barks loudly again giving Vicky a bit of a
fright and clambers out towards the corn-field

ANGLE - BURT and DIEHL

Diehl is definitely worried about something and not only
Sarge on whom hes keeping a close watch

DIEHL
Sarge You stay right here

BURT
What do you mean ‘nothing for you
in Gatlin

DIEHL
Well folks in Gatlin got religion
They dont cotton to outsiders and
you probably wont find a phone

He looks around Burt towards Sarge who is whining and
sniffing at the edge of the cornfield Burt turns also

ANGLE - BURT and DIEHL S POV

The corn in front of Sarge is waving vigorously in the
wind

TWO SHOT

DIEHL

Mister Id sure like to stay here
and shoot the breeze with ya talk
about politics and farm futures
but right now I got work to do You
get on that right fork over there
and youll be in Hemingford in no
time

(sudden vehement)
Sarge I said AT EASE

BURT
(sarcastic)
Well thanks a lot Youve been a
real help

Diehl watches as he gets back into the t-bird
ANGLE

Diehl is standing in front of the car torn between
apologizing to Burt and wanting to get back to Sarge

DIEHL
Hey you got a busted headlight
Mister Looks like some blood on
it

Burt leans out the window Diehl is increasingly nervous
DIEHL

You have some kinda oxidant or
somethin’

BURT
Why You have time to fix it for
me

Hes letting the old man know that he knows something is
wrong here

DIEHL
No but you can get it fixed

BURT
In Hemingford

Diehl nods affirmative with smile then looks for Sarge
What he sees alarms him He goes running towards the dog

DIEHL
Sarge

INT THE CAR

Burt pulls out of the station just a bit too fast Something
about Diehl has agitated him

BURT
Either that guy was terrified of
something or hes been out in the
sun too long

EXT THE CAR - DAY

The t-bird drives up to the fork in the road pauses
momentarily then takes the right fork towards Heming-ford

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Sarge barking feverishly runs into the cornfield Diehl
arrives at the edge of the corn just a moment too late He
dares not follow even his beloved dog

DIEHL

Sarge Sarge

EXT THE CAR - DAY
It whips past a sign for GATLIN — 2 MILES
INT CAR

Vicky has begun taking things out of the suitcase and folding
them neatly on the seat

VICKY
Theres nothing much in here Just

pocket knife matches and an apple

BURT
Smart kid He mustve figured he
might have to sleep out a night or
two

Vicky holds up a COLLEGE T-SHIRT with the NEBRASKA
CORNHUSKERS and number 19 emblazoned on front The thought
of it makes her start crying again

VICKY
Oh BurtLook maybe he was
hoping to go to the university

BURT
Might have been

VICKY
WhyWhy

EXT ROAD —- DAY

The t-bird screeches to a halt as it COMES INTO FRAME It
BACKS UP TOWARDS THE CAMERA From this angle we can see a
WHITE SIGNPOST with GATLIN ROAD marked in BLACK LETTERS It
stands at the corner of A TINY ONE LANE ROAD that is not
easily seen

INT THUNDERBIRD
Burt and Vicky consider the road through the windshield

BURT
This has to go to Gatlin Every
sign weve seen has been for Gatlin
and none for Hemingford We cant
be more than a mile away

VICKY
What about what the gas station guy
said

BURT

That crazy old coot I cant
believe there isnt a public phone
in an entire town I dont care how
small it is

VICKY
Well lets just do whatevers
fastest
Burt drives forward and turns left onto Gatlin Road Its

EXTREMELY NARROW even more claustrophobic than the one they
were just on

CUT TO
EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Chester is still calling to Sarge but theres neither sight
nor sound of the dog Diehls call has become a lament

DIEHL
Ah SargeWhyd ya hafta go after
‘em

The only reply is the rustling of the corn
ANGLE - FAVORING PICK-UP TRUCK
THE HAND OF A CHILD pulls a cross-shaped lug wrench out of
the back of the truck Diehl was working on when Burt and
Vicky first drove up The hand clangs the wrench against the
side of the truck
ANGLE - FAVORING DIEHL
He whips around knowing hes heard something but not seeing
any sign of what it was He looks back to the corn as if to
call Sarge one last time but is too bothered by the noise
hes just heard Instead he takes a few tentative steps
towards the pick-up
DIEHL
(fearful)
Izzat youIzzat you What da —
What are you doin’ in there
The answer he gets is ANOTHER NOISE this time coming from
his office He turns and faces that way craning his neck to
see His breath is quick In a word hes terrified He
takes a few steps towards the office
ANGLE

The corn all around the station is beginning to rustle even
more furiously than it had been

ANGLE - DIEHL

He approaches the office Another few feet to go
ANGLE - THE CORN

Still moving weird and ominous

ANGLE- DIEHL

Chester reaches for the office door His hand is shaking
Just as it swings open we

CUT TO

INT CAREXT FIELD - BURT and VICKYS POV - DAY

The car comes to the top of a rise and Burt and Vicky are
treated to a panorama ofMORE CORN Burt puts on the brakes

BURT
Somethings wrong That last sign
said Gatlin was one mile

VICKY
That sign was damaged in the last
ice age
BURT
Its got to be around here some-
where
VICKY
(spooked)

Why dont we just go back and take
the road to Hemingford

BURT
Because its silly to go nineteen
miles when you only need to go one
Its worse than silly Its

suspicious

VICKY
When you have a body in the
trunk

BURT
And a broken headlight with blood
on it

He proceeds on 50 yards ahead is another left turn

BURT
Okay lets try this one

He turns onto yet a smaller road They are going deeper and
deeper into the corn

CUT TO
INT OFFICE - GAS STATION
Chester Diehl breathes a sigh of relief Hes standing

inside the door to his office and mercifully hes alone
Theres nothing but the usual mess

DIEHL
Musta been the wind

And just as he says this theres a loud CRASH

DIEHL
Oh Lordy Please be the wind

He exits the office again taking those short frightened
tentative steps

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

He walks over to the pick-up Hes whimpering softly
talking to himself trying to keep his nerve

DIEHL
Course its the wind Them hood
latches aint worth a damn Blow
over in a bad fart

ANGLE

He reaches the truck and starts fighting the hood which is
stuck Suddenly the HUMMING we have heard before - pagan
atonal and eerie - breaks the silence Chester jerks around
but sees nothing HE WALKS TOWARDS THE CAMERA

DIEHL
Who is it Whos there I didnt
tell them anything I swear it I
kept our bargain just like
always

But the humming has stopped and no one appears Diehl waits
Nothing happens By and by he figures maybe this too was the
wind Now he goes back to the truck

ANGLE

He lifts the hood with a mighty heave As it opens it
reveals something that makes Chester Diehl scream

ANGLE - THE ENGINE - DIEHLS POV

Sarges head cut off at a bloody stump of a neck is resting
squarely on the engine The eyes have rolled backwards and
up and the beer can from his neck ring has been stuffed in
his mouth giving the decapitated beast a comically macabre
look Theres blood all over the engine

ANGLE

It takes Chester a moment to stop screaming The shock has
caused him to stumble back away from the truck After a few
steps he staggers around in circles looking on every side
for danger He continues to move back until he comes to the
garage bay door

ANGLE

Hes standing next to the door looking around wildly when
he spots a long handled WRENCH He picks it up protectively
and waits Nothing happens for a beat Then the bay door
clatters up behind him and Chester whirls around the wrench
raised over his head He stares into the darkness

DIEHL
You bastards I You killed my Sarge
Ill get you for what you done to
him

CUT TO
EXT ROAD - DAY
The t-bird bounces along the tiny road The corn seems to be
moving in on it two giant green walls about to crush a
darting insect

INT CAR

Both Burt and Vicky are nervous now spooked and disoriented
Both speak with a frantic edge in their voices

VICKY
This isnt the way Im telling
you

BURT
Its got to be We made a left and
a left

They drive on further Burt is intense speaking to calm
himself as well as Vicky

BURT
These roads are straight No
curves If anything this one has
to let us out by the station

Vicky doesnt answer

ANGLE

They come to a wall of corn where the road ends ina
perpendicular T Burt squeals the brakes and he and Vicky
hear things toppling in the trunk

VICKY
What was that

BURT
It was just my golf bag

VICKY
Are you sure

BURT
What do you mean Am I sure Of
course Im sure

VICKY
I mean about the boy Are you sure
he was dead

BURT
Vicky

He looks at the road in front then behind them trying to go
gauge their direction He decides to go left again

EXT THE CAR - DAY

We can tell from the way the tires screech that Burt is a man
who is quickly losing control The car fish-tails into the
turn

CUT TO

INT GARAGE BAY

A battle is going on more like a kill with a pack of wild
animals taunting their surrounded prey before they move in
The garage bay is fairly large strewn with old tires boxes
oil cans rags hoses and various other instruments and
acquisitions of the trade In the center shiny red 1960
MERCURY SEDAN sits over the single LIFT

ANGLE

Chester Diehl is the surrounded animal and he isnt going
down without a fight

He is flailing wildly with ‘his long handled wrench trying
to hit the black clad children who dart in and out of his
reach They are all armed with farm tools They are led by
Malachai Diehl focuses on him

DIEHL
You murderin little devil I done
everything you said I never told
anyone Not once in three years

He swings the wrench clumsily Malachai steps sprightly out
of the way He can kill Diehl any time he wants

DIEHL
(contemptuous )
Call yourself the Lords Children

MALACHAT
We do his bidding from shine to
shadow

DIEHL

The devil’s

MALACHAT
He Who Walks Behind The Rows

Diehl swings again this time causing himself to trip and
stumble forward Malachai kicks him backwards into a GROUP of
his accomplices They begin to beat and hack at the old man
He scatters them with the wrench

CUT TO
EXT ROAD - DAY
The t-bird is chewing up road barreling along at close to
sixty We get a sense from this shot of desperation as if
the vehicle itself were frightened It rips over bumps turns
and dips
ANGLE - THE CAR

It is strewn with corn silk and leaves which cling despite
the air drag

INT CAR
Burt and Vicky are silent They come to another T Burt hits

the brakes suddenly coming to the realization that the corn
is his adversary

VICKY
(losing it)
Oh God Were never going to get
out of here

BURT
Stop it Vicky We will too

VICKY
Then tell me where we are

He answers with another left turn

BURT
Right back where we started

ANGLE

Theyve turned onto a bigger road one that looks vaguely
familiar

VICKY
I think youre right This looks
like the first one we were on

BURT
I told you

They continue along picking up speed
EXT THE CAR - HEAD ON SHOT —- DAY

The t-bird comes hurtling TOWARDS THE CAMERA As it fills
the frame it slows to a halt Burt and Vicky sit
motionless staring in disbelief at something that is BEHIND
THE CAMERA

ANGLE

The car doors open on both sides Burt and Vicky get out and
move towards something OFF SCREEN Their expressions show
bewilderment and revulsion

ANGLE - THE CORNFIELD - BURT and VICKYS POV - DAY

In front of the car we see the SWERVE MARKS where the car
tried to avoid Joseph This is definitely the spot The corn
from where he was murdered out to the road is now an oozing
blackened version of its former self Where it was green and
strong (and bloody) it is now rotting and wilted It has
not been burned Rather it has become diseased and decayed
in this short period of time This area has become a cancer
on the other-wise healthy green landscape

BURT AND VICKY

stare at it comprehending only on a subliminal level
Vickyis cringing beyond words Burt steps forward He
looks at Vicky

ANGLE - VICKY - BURTS POV

Her eyes have the look of a crippled gazelle that knows its
being pursued by lions She has somehow read her own death
sentence in this

TWO SHOT

Burt walks over to her He has found a reservoir of strength
in all this horror He rejects Vickys obvious fatalism

BURT
Were going back to that gas
station I want some answers and I
think that old man as them We’re
driving in circles lLet’s go back

Vicky gazes at him blankly a frightened hopeless look about
her

EXT GAS STATION - DAY

The car pulls into the station A quiet kind of danger
pervades the place

ANGLE

Burt gets out of the car resolutely but stays near it for
safety He scans all around Theres no sign of Chester
Sarge or anyone else

BURT
Hey Old Timer

Nothing He reaches in through the window and hits the horn

BURT
I want to speak to you

Still no reply unless the very loud silence counts

BURT
(to Vicky)
Hes got to be around here some-
where

ANGLE

Burt walks over to the pick-up He looks inside the cab
then notices the hood is ajar mostly down but with six
inches of gap Reflexively he goes to lift it but before he
does

ANGLE
Vicky gets out of the car and calls to him

VICKY
Maybe hes inside in the bathroom
or something

ANGLE

Burt forgets the hood (and under it Sarges head) and walks
around the side of the station to the door marked MEN He
knocks on it

BURT
Hello Anybody in there

Nothing He tries the handle but its locked He walks back
towards the front office Vicky meets him

BURT
How about you wait in the car

VICKY
Not on your life

BURT
Alright But stay behind me And
keep your eyes open

They head for the office Burt leading the way
INT OFFICE

Burt and Vicky enter the office It is exactly as it was when
we saw Diehl in pt except for one glaring incongruity
THERE IS CORN EVERYWHERE Ears leaves stalks and silk
piled on the desk stuffed in the water cooler heaped in the
garbage pail etc It is macabre eerie Vicky gasps Burt
tightens

ANGLE

Burt puts his face up to the glass window on the door that
separates the office from the garage bay

The bay is dark inside and Burt had to wipe the dirt off the
window to see what little he can do

INT GARAGE BAY — OFFICE DOOR — CAMERA’S POV

The door between the bay and the office opens and after a
brief hesitation Burt and Vicky enter the dim room It is
illuminated from light coming from the outside and the
office but shadows fall everywhere

ANGLE

Burt AND Vicky enter cautiously making as little noise as
possible They look around The place is a mess having
been torn apart during Diehl’s struggle wit the Children
Only THE MERCURY remains untouched an island of stability
amidst the destruction Burt and Vicky move towards it
ANGLE

Vicky’s elbow hits a HUBCAP on a WORKBENCH It falls to the
floor with a loud CLATTER She and Burt jump simultaneously
stifling their alarm the instant they realize what it is
ANGLE

The reach the Mercury Burt peers inside

INT MERCURY — BURT’S POV

Nothing A nice red interior an empty pack of Camels and a
loaded ashtray but no bodies bogeymen or Chester Diehl

ANGLE

Vicky taps him on the shoulder She points to a corn leaf
protruding on a funny angle from the underneath the car
Burt kneels down and looks under the car It is piled with
corn which he tries to pull out but can’t

ANGLE

Burt gets up the dust off his pants Vicky looks at him
quizzically He doesn’t say anything instead goes over to
the LIFT CONTROL and pushes down the lever

ANGLE

The Merc begins to float upwards as the hydraulic machine
hums

ANGLE — THE PIT

The rising lift reveals THE BODY OF CHESTER DIEHL bludgeoned
and bloody lying dead in the pit His body is festooned
with corn plants and his arm which is bent grotesquely away
at an unnatural angle holds aloft a hand that clutches
another of the CORNCOB CRUCIFIXES Vicky screams Burt
swoons

JOB’S VOICE OVER NARRATION COMPLETES THIS SCENE

JOB (VO)
I think his name was Mr Diehl but
once I heard Malachai say it was
Judas

CRASH CUT TO
EXT THE ROAD — FAVORING SCREECHING TIRES — DAY

The tries belong to the thunderbird and it is getting as far
and as fast away from that gas station as is possible The
rubber cries out for traction as the rpm’s exceed their
ability to grip the asphalt As a result they protest with
blue smoke

ANGLE

The car starts to follow the right fork again but suddenly
jumps the triangular dirt divider and shoots onto the rutted
secondary road Towards Gatlin

CUT TO
EXT A CLEARING IN THE CORN — DAY

The arm of someone living is holding up a corncob crucifix
CAMERA PULLS BACK and WE FIND OURSELVES at another religious
gathering There are about 50 BOYS AND GIRLS between the
ages of 8 and 18 along with SEVERAL NEWBORN INFANTS
Everyone is dressed in black or gray except Isaac who is the
one holding aloft the crucifix The group is humming that
bizarre chant we’ve now come to associate with them

ANGLE

Isaac is facing the others about to lead a sermon Behind
him is the wooden base of what we will later see is a LARGE
CRUCIFIX Isaac lowers his hand abruptly and the humming
cuts off

ISAAC
Behold A dream did come to me in
the night and the Lord did shew all
this to met

GROUP
Praise God Praise the Lord

ISAAC
A time of tribulation has come A
test is at hand The Final Test

MALACHAT
What has the Lord commanded

ANGLE

Isaac turns and looks up at the crucifix that towers behind
him CAMERA PANS UP following his gaze and we see the
decaying body of a CRUCIFIED MAN on it A few tattered BLUE
RAGS of clothing hang off of it and on the skeletal head is
a BLUE POLICE CHIEF hat Most of the skin has been picked
clean by crows but the eyes are left bulging and sightless
The body has been festooned with dried corn leaves and corn
husks are piled around its feet like an offering

ISAAC
In the dream the Lord did come to
me and He was a shape It was He
Who Walks Behind the Rows and I
did fall on my knees in terror and
hide my eyes lest the fierceness of
His face strike me dead And He
told me all that has since
happened He said ‘Joseph has
taken his things and fled this
happy place because the worship of
me is no more upon him So take
you his life and spill his blood
but let not his flesh pollute the
corn Cast him instead upon the
road

GROUP
Yea and so it was done Joseph
the Unbeliever was cast upon the
road

ANGLE
CAMERA PANS THE FACES of the group as they speak They are

robots Unquestioning Fundamentalist Future Moral
Majoritarians They listen raptly to their Ayatollah

ISAAC
And He Who Walks Behind The Rows
did say I will send outlanders
amongst you a man and a woman and
these outlanders will be un-
believers and profaners of the
Holy and the man shall sorely test
you for he has great power even
greater than The Blue Man

CAMERA PICKS UP The Blue Man on the crucifix with its
grotesquely jaunty cap All eyes have turned to it CAMERA
ZOOMS IN to its face as the ceremony continues

GROUP (VO)
The Blue Man Yes The Blue
Man

ISAAC (VO)

And we shall not fail Him for He
is the true God the only God and
His message has been planted within
us as the corn seed is put into the
ground

(rising)
Make sacrifice unto Him Bring Him
the blood of the Unbelievers 1

Malachai jumps to his feet and shouts in a killing fervor

MALACHAI (VO)
Make sacrifice

The group stirred by this rises to its feet also

GROUP (VO)
Make sacrifice Yes

They start their chanting again
The CAMERA is by now on a CLOSE-UP of The Blue Mans face
It FILLS THE SCREEN those bulging eyes staring out at us
The humming grows in intensity

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PORCH - GATLIN - DAY
Job and Sarah are sitting on the dusty porch of the house
where we first saw them (inside) Theyre still dressed in

their costumes They look like caricatures of two
anachronistic broken down aristocrats

SARAH
Now what do we do
JOB
I wanna get out of here
SARAH
How
JOB
Like Joseph
SARAH
No
JOB
Why not If he can do it so can
we

Sarah leafs through a pile of manila paper she has next to
her She extracts one and hands it to Job

ANGLE - THE DRAWING - JOBS POV

It shows us in Sarahs innocent style what we DID NOT see
happening to Joseph - Malachai (in stick figure) pulling an
oversized knife across the helpless boys throat A number of
other children watch gleefully There is blood everywhere
spewing out into the corn

ANGLE - TWO SHOT
Job starts to whimper
JOB

I dont like Malachai I want my
mommy and daddy

SARAH
Theyre gone Jobie Theyre in
the corn

JOB

Its not fair I wish Isaac never
came here

SARAH
(resigned)
Hes always been here Just like He
Who Walks Behind The Rows

They sit there on the edge of the porch legs dangling over
the side Job pouting and Sarah contemplating

CUT TO
EXT A ROAD SIGN - DAY

Another old and weather-beaten sign It reads YOU ARE NOW
ENTERING GATLIN NICEST LITTLE TOWN IN NEBRASKA POPULATION

ANGLE

CAMERA PULLS BACK to show the highway and the corn The t-
bird ENTERS THE FRAME and we follow it down the road We see
A BARN rising above the edge of the corn-field in the near
distance Written on it in large white letters is the
legend ONLY JESUS SAVES

INT CAR

Vicky is leaning against the door staring out the window
She looks haggard and beaten

BURT
We should’ve come this way the
first time

VICKY
Would it have saved that old man

Burt looks at her surprised by the question and concerned by
the tone

BURT
I don’t know Hopefully the police
will be able to figure that out

They drove for a moment Vicky begins to giggle Burt looks
at her with even more concern The giggle is a stream that
turns into a river She presses her hand to her mouth
trying to suppress a hysterical laughter a laughter of
catharsis and relief

BURT
What are you laughing at

VICKY
Did you see those signs The ones
on the side of the road

Gales of laughter now

VICKY
There There are some more Slow
down

EXT THE SIGNS - BURT and VICKYS POV - DAY
They border the right side of the road Theres a single
word stenciled on each wooden board The entire set reads
ACLOUDBY DAYAPILLAROFFIREBYNIGHT
INT THUNDERBIRD
Vickys laughter is subsiding but slowly Shes had a much
needed belly laugh Burt doesnt really think its funny but
hes glad Vicky does
VICKY
(wiping tears)

They only forgot one thing

BURT
Whats that

VICKY
Burma Shave

BURT
Honey are you sure youre alright

She finally stops laughing but dabs her eyes with a tissue
VICKY

We get our first full glimpse of the town Its ina dip at
the bottom of a hill Theres ONE MAIN STREET a few cross
streets A PARK in the center and a few dusty elms Justa
sleepy little town dozing in the summer sun

INT THUNDERBIRD

Burt and Vicky are checking out the town Theres a quiet
tense apprehension about it that they share

VICKY
Looks like The Twilight Zone

EXT THE TOWN - INCLUDING T-BIRD - DAY

The car is cruising at a moderate speed It passes a few
residential side streets The houses are American Gothic -
wooden white paint porches - but nothing moves So it
seems There are no cars trucks bicycles people no kids
playing stickball or retired farmers smoking corncob pipes on
their porches

ANGLE - A HOUSE

What Burt and Vicky dont see however are eyes that are
upon them A FACE watching from an attic window disappears
behind a lace curtain

ANGLE

The car now passes a BRICK BUILDING This sign on the
yellowed patchy front door reads PUBLIC LIBRARY With
luck it contains 500 books TWO BOYS rise slowly froma
crouched position by the side of it They watch the passing
t-bird intently

INT FEED and SUPPLY STORE

It is old dusty and locked up Bags of feed and fertilizer
are piled high FIVE CHILDREN three males and two females
stare through the window

THEIR POV - THE STREET - DAY The thunderbird rolls by

INT THUNDERBIRD

Burt and Vicky are feeling more and more apprehensive

Theres obviously something wrong here Burt is going very
slowly almost reluctant to proceed further into this place

BURT
I guess nobody told them we were

VICKY

BURT

Ah hell theyre probably all out
under a tent somewhere singing
Praise The Lord

Vicky isnt convinced

EXT COFFEE SHOP —- DAY

The car slows to a stop in front of HAN SENS COFFEE SHOP
scene of the opening carnage Like every other place in this
town it looks empty and deserted

INT CAR

Burt and Vicky are checking it out

BURT
Lets see if theres a phone

VICKY
Unless a ghost is using it

Unlike when we last saw it there is no sign of what went on
here All of the tables and chairs are set up the booths
clean and the counter spotless The only thing lacking is
any sign of recent use

ANGLE

As Burt and Vicky enter The door closing behind them
muffles a sound from the kitchen

ANGLE — KITCHEN

A BLACK SLEEVED ARM reaches to a butcher block and picks up a
CLEAVER

ANGLE — THE FRONT ROOM

Burt is trying the pay phone with no luck Vicky is looking
at the CHALKBOARD on the counter It says TODAY’S SPECIAL
MEAT LOAF CORN FRITTERS MOM HANSEN’S HOMEMADE PIE 274
Vicky runs her finger along the counter and looks at the
dust Burt hangs up the receiver disgustedly

BURT
Nothing Not even a dial tone

PARKING LOT —- DAY

TWO BOYS sneak along the side of the car They carry sides
and keep low out of sight

INT COFFEE SHOP

Burt and Vicky are about to leave when they hear a NOISE in
the kitchen Burt starts towards the kitchen door but Vicky
grabs him

VICKY

BURT
Vicky youre really spooked Come

VICKY
Please Humor me I dont want

The urgency in her voice her insistence wins him

BURT
Alright But at least lets look
around some more Theres got to be
somebody

And just as they turn towards the front door Burt spots the
two somebodys messing with the car Theyve got the door
open and are trying to sneak in

BURT
Hey Get away from that car
EXT PARKING LOT —- DAY

The boys both around 12 dart off leaving the door open
Burt dashes out after them several steps ahead of Vicky but

isnt quick enough to catch them
BURT
See that Just like back home
Leave your car for two minutes and
look what happens
He hurries back to the drivers side and gets in

BURT
Get in I dont want to lose them

She follows him into the car quickly

INT CAR
It lurches forward in the direction the boys ran

VICKY
What are you going to do when you
catch them

BURT

help What else
(beat)

EXT TOWN - BURT and VICKYS POV - DAY

VICKY

Hemingford Itll take us twenty
minutes

BURT
But weve found people

VICKY
Yeah A couple of kids who tried
to break into our car
Burt debates

BURT
There is something strange about
this place After the way the old
man acted

VICKY
And what happened to him

The thought chills her

BURT
Maybe youre right We might be
better off in a larger town anyway

He makes a U-turn in the middle of the street and starts
heading out of town Something stops him OFF SCREEN

BURT
Over there

VICKY

BURT
I saw a door open and close That
house

VICKY

He starts driving towards the house

VICKY

BURT

A quick look It cant hurt

Vicky doesnt answer him They pull up in front of the
house

EXT HOUSE - DAY

Burt is up the steps to the porch in two bounds Vicky takes
longer Shes nervous and sullen Only a SCREEN DOOR
separates them from the inside Burt shouts through it

BURT
Hello Anybody home

He bangs on the frame a few times

BURT
Hello Weve had an accident Wed

VICKY
You see I told you Now can we

Burt frowns He pauses for a beat then opens the door and
pokes his head in

VICKY
Burt This is somebodys house

BURT
Precisely And all we want to do
is use their phone

He enters the house Reluctantly Vicky follows

INT HOUSE

Theres a living room off to the left a dining room to the
right and a staircase straight ahead Other rooms are in
back

ANGLE - THEIR POV

What isnt broken or cracked is worn torn or faded The

upholstery on the couch in the living room looks as if
someone took a knife to it

The stuffing has been gouged out of the seat A cracked
picture frame hangs lopsidedly over it
TWO SHOT

Burt and Vicky look at each other Neither likes the feeling
about this place

BURT
I’11 check the back

CAMERA FOLLOWS BURT behind the staircase and into the
kitchen

INT KITCHEN

In disrepair and disuse like the rest of the house it does
contain one item of interest to Burt A TELEPHONE He grabs
the receiver and raises it but never gets a chance to dial
THE WIRE - BURTS POV

Cut It dangles uselessly from the receiver

ANGLE - FOYER

Vicky watches as Burt walks out holding the useless phone
with its severed wire

BURT
I found a phone

VICKY
Well it certainly goes with the
decor

BURT

Back door was open too Whoever I
saw mustve slipped out Probably
one of those kids I chased off

VICKY
Yeah Who else would avoid us I

body in the trunk

BURT

Why dont we sit down and make
ourselves comfortable

(MORE )

VICKY (contd)
Im sure nobody1ll mind if we pour

the first drinks Then when the
City Council shows up

BURT
Okay I surrender Were going

He moves towards the front door under her triumphant stare
conceding tacitly her right to be annoyed Theyre about to
leave when A FLOORBOARD CREAKS above They hear it and FREEZE
simultaneously

VICKY
Dont you dare

Burt is like a puppy whos spied a squirrel up in a tree Or
thinks he has He shushes her his eyes never leaving the
ceiling as he moves towards the staircase

VICKY
Burt This is ridiculous Im
getting really angry

BURT
(whispering)
Come on Vick Dont you want to
know who it is Why theyre hiding
from us This whole thing is so
bizarre

VICKY
(shouting whisper)
All the more reason to get out now

Burt is already walking up the stairs Very slowly and
quietly his eyes constantly on the landing above Vicky
pouts and sulks and sighs and fidgets at the bottom knowing
shes unable to stop him His curiosity is contagious as much
as shed like to deny it

ANGLE

Burt slinks up the staircase like a cat stalking an
unsuspecting bird ANOTHER NOISE FOLLOWED BY FOOT-STEPS He
stops and looks at Vicky

ANGLE - VICKY

As her eyes meet Burt’s Someone is sneaking around up
there They both know it but Vicky fears it more

ANGLE

Burt gets to the first landing He checks ahead -the stairs
now reverse direction - then looks back at Vicky one last
time He is visibly more tense now Hes starting to sweat
and his breath quickens He takes a step forward and creaks
a floorboard himself It freezes him to the spot After a
beat he continues

UPSTAIRS - BURTS POV

TWO BEDROOMS and a BATHROOM are visible A SHORT STAIRCASE
leads up to a MASTER BEDROOM

ANGLE

Burt steps on another loose board It CREAKS VERY LOUDLY
Anybody waiting for him has to know where he is by that one
He sucks in a breath MORE FOOTSTEPS FROM ABOVE

ANGLE

Burt is at the top landing between the two bedrooms He looks
into one of them then disappears into it

INT BEDROOM

We recognize from the bed and bulletin board that this is the
bedroom Sarah was sick in three years ago when her father was
on the phone with her mother x just before he was murdered
Only now on that bulletin board are tacked ALL OF THE
PICTURES weve thus seen of her stick figure prophesies

The bedroom looks like it hasnt been used in a long time or
at least cleaned and is dusty and full of cobwebs but those
crayon drawings on the manila paper are a childs
illustrations of the nightmare that took over Gatlin

ANGLE - THE DRAWINGS - INCLUDING BURT

Burt studies the drawings He is seeing them for the first
time and they chill him to the marrow He rips off the
rendition of HE WHO WALKS BEHIND THE ROWS and stares at it
QUICK SHOT - THE PICTURE

As Burt stares at it The evil figure stares back out at
him

ANGLE — HALLWAY
Just as Burt turns out of the doorway he comes face to face

with Vicky Each jumps and gasps at the same
time their hearts racking and their eyes widening

Before they have a chance to rebuke each other another NOISE
FROM UPSTAIRS They look towards the master bedroom and nod
in silent agreement

ANGLE

They get to the top of the short staircase and are about to
look into the master bedroom in fact are craning their necks
and gripping each other with white knuckles from the tension
when a TREMENDOUS HORRIFIC SHRIEK scares the daylights out
of them

VOICE
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAWIPE OUT

Vicky loses it She screams before she can realize that its
a record as the MUSIC of the oldie WIPE OUT continues
playing Burt charges into the bedroom

INT BEDROOM

Burt stops dead in his tracks finding himself staring down
an equally frightened and surprised Sarah Vicky enters the
bedroom a BEAT later Burt begins to laugh Vicky joins him
They laugh almost as hard as Vicky did in the car when she
saw the signs outside Gatlin but they stop themselves when
they realize how frightened the child is

BURT
Im sorry Dont be afraid We
didnt mean to scare you

Sarah is staring at them like theyre from another planet
She warms to Vicky though

VICKY
Well hello What a darling little
girl Whats your name

SARAH
(sheepish)
Sarah
VICKY

Sarah Thats a lovely name Im
Vicky and this is Burt

Sarah wont look at Burt She steals a glance at Vicky

BURT
Are you alone here Sarah

She doesnt answer

VICKY
Do you live here

Sarah shakes her head no

BURT
You just come here to play

Sarah looks down at the floor Her record finishes and she
takes it off the turntable

ANGLE

Burt notices the manila paper and crayons next to her
registering the connection to the terrible pictures hes just
seen He says nothing for the moment

WIDE ANGLE

VICKY
Are your mommy and daddy around
Sarah

Sarah answers as if thats a stupid question but the thought
of the answer saddens her anyway

SARAH
Theyre in the cornfield

VICKY
What are they doing there

SARAH
All the grownups are there

BURT
Well are they working Or are they
having some kind of meeting

SARAH
(frustrated a little
frightened)
Noooo Isaac put them there

BURT
Isaac Whos Isaac

Sarah shrugs defensively She doesnt want to answer

VICKY
Tell us who Isaac is darling

SARAH
Our leader

Now Burt is getting frustrated and a little impatient

BURT
Leader of what

SARAH
Of everybody

Burt throws up his hands and walks over to the window Hes
had enough of this conversation and frankly so have I Vicky
keeps at it with Sarah turning even sweeter and more patient
in the wake of Burts reaction

VICKY
Could you take us to Isaac

SARAH
(very grave)
Uhhhh-uhhhh
ANGLE - BURT

While the conversation continues in the BG we watch as Burt
looks out the window and sees something that bewilders him

VICKY (VO)
Why not

EXT CORNFIELD - BURTS POV - DAY

That same immense invisible force we saw in the cornfield
just before Chester Diehl was killed is now moving towards
the town The corn is shaking wildly and the sky darkens at a
tremendous rate A HOWLING WIND accompanies this It sounds
ALIVE

INT BEDROOM - BURT

He looks away for a second blinking his eyes in disbelief

SARAH (VO)
Hes scary

Burt looks out at the cornfield after his momentary respite

VICKY (VO)
(to Sarah)
(MORE)

VICKY (contd)
Sarah its very important that we
speak to some grownups as soon as
possible Is there anyone around
that you can think of

EXT THE CORNFIELD - BURTS POV - DAY

Burt rubs his eyes and accepts the possibility that stress is
getting to him He walks back to Vicky

SARAH

SARAH
Into the corn

Burt intervenes

BURT
Were not getting anywhere with
this Vick

VICKY
Give her a chance honey She
keeps saying the townspeople are
out in the cornfield
(to Sarah)
Right sweetheart All of the
grownups are in the corn

Sarah nods affirmatively There is a chilling quality to the
innocence with which she does this

BURT
I tell you what then You stay
here with her I want to go look
in that municipal building

VICKY
(alarmed )
Why
BURT
Why Because weve got a double

murder to report and were standing

here with a pint sized version of
Catherine the Great trying to make
sense out of what happened to all
the people in this town

VICKY
I just thought she could help us

BURT
I know Maybe youre right Shes
all we have for the moment anyway
At least lets not lose track of

her

VICKY
Alright Maybe somebody will come
for her

BURT

If they do you just bring them
over to the car and hit the horn
Ill keep an eye open

He kisses her lightly and heads for the door
his departure suddenly makes Vicky nervous

VICKY
BurtDo you think itssafe

Burt pulls up in front of the building He climbs the steps
to a pair of WOODEN DOORS Theres A DRIFT OF CORN HUSKS at
the top step and another CORNCOB CRUCIFIX hung on each of the
doors Burt looks at these thoughtfully for a moment
growing more grim by the second He goes inside

CUT TO
INT BEDROOM - SARAH and VICKY

Sarah is sitting on the floor Vicky on the bed Vicky tries
to calm herself by calming Sarah

VICKY
Well I guess its just you and me

Sarah smiles at her She is a lot less nervous than Vicky
VICKY
So tell me what were you doing

Sarah balks tugs at her dress

She arranges the paper and crayons and begins drawing Shes
so sweet and adorable that Vicky can hardly take her eyes off
of her

CUT TO
INT MUNICIPAL BUILDING

Burt pushes through the doors and steps into the LOBBY of the
building What we see is not what he sees We see briefly a
scene from three years ago

A LARGE ROOM - BURTS POV

off of which are several doors all with frosted glass and

black lettering One says BUREAU OF REGISTRATION another
is DEEDS and a third says DOG OFFICER In the back is a

SIGN that designates RESTROOMS

ANGLE

The room is lively and full of people THE MUNICIPAL WORKERS
of Gatlin country folks in casual attire are crowded around
A TRIO OF YOUNG CHILDREN who are handing out LEMONADE and
charging quarters for it The kids have brought a PORTABLE
STAND into the room complete with pitchers ice and a sign
and a cup for change and the adults are finding themselves
amused and refreshed

It takes a moment for the deadly poison in the drink to take
effect and as the shocked and confused people are trying to
figure out whats happening to them AN OLDER GROUP of
TEENAGERS led by Malachai charge in with their slaughtering
weapons They cut their helpless victims down mercilessly

ANGLE

The RESTROOM DOOR opens and POLICE CHIEF BILL HOTCHKISS comes
out straightening his belt He sees the carnage and freezes
So do the murderers They hadnt expected this Hotchkiss is
dumbfounded and horrified but he has the presence of mind to
flee just as a half dozen of the demonic kids leap out at him
with their weapons

Malachai expertly throws a knife after the police chief but
Hotchkiss has slammed shut the door The knife buries itself
in the wood

As he scans the quiet empty room There are no bodies but
the place is a shambles Desks chairs and tables are
overturned filing cabinets are down and everywhere is CORN
dried brittle and yellowed with age

oldest boys we have seen between 15 and 18 years old and
some of them are pretty big All of them are scary They

big semi-circle around Malachai and theyre humming their
weird song as they close in All are armed

CUT TO
INT REGISTRATION OFFICE

Burt is exploring the office Its a shambles like the
other room and corn is heaped everywhere in here too

ANGLE - BURT

He takes all this in with growing bewilderment Then helooks
up at the far wall and we see his eyes widen with surprise

THE WALL - BURTS POV

Its dominated by the strangest PORTRAIT OF CHRIST weve ever
seen We know its Christ but even so theres a stronger
resemblance to Lon Chaney in The Phantom Of The Opera This
Christ is grinning and he has green hair but after a moment
we see it really isnt hair at all but rather corn plants

ANGLE

Burt crosses the room to the picture and takes it off the
wall standing on a chair to do so He stares at the hideous
corruption for a moment and then smashes it on the floor He
isnt out of control but the image has affected and offended
him deeply He heads for the door

ANGLE
CAMERA LINGERS on the window as Burt exits Slowly one by
one THREE BOYS all crowned in BLACK RIMMED HATS look in at
us and scan the now vacant office They hold a brief
whispered conversation and then duck OUT OF VIEW

Oh Can I see

SARAH
Yes

She finishes a couple of strokes and hands the picture to
Vicky

ANGLE VICKY CU

Her face goes from bemused to horrified to repelled as she
looks at the picture

ANGLE

We can tell from Sarahs expectant face that she has
absolutely no idea that what shes drawn is bad in any way
Vicky is about to rebuke her when we hear the sound of GLASS
BREAKING Vicky whips around and looks out the doorway

CUT TO

INT MUNICIPAL BLDG STAIRWELL

Burt climbs the stairs to the THIRD FLOOR Hes tired
sweating heavily and beaten He pulls the door open and
exits into a dark corridor

ANGLE - CORRIDOR WALL

ANGLE
Burt turns into the police chiefs office and gets a fright

cloth shirt

CUT TO
INT HOUSE

Vicky comes out of the bedroom and stops at the top of the
stairs

VICKY
(anxious tentative)
Burt Is that you

She walks down the short staircase The answer at first is
silence Then softly the humming Vicky listens and
clutches in her right hand the picture Sarah drew Curiosity
gets the better of her Ever so slowly she tiptoes down to
the top of the second landing and looks down

ANGLE - THE FIRST FLOOR - VICKYS POV

The humming gets louder The Children Of The Corn begin to
congregate at the bottom of the stairs They stare at Vicky
through rabid eyes Their weapons and their intent are

plainly visible

VICKY
(shouts)
Who are you

They hum steadily Vicky shouts even louder Shes
terrified

VICKY
What do you want

The humming stops abruptly
ANGLE

Malachai steps forward from the rear He looks up at Vicky
with a blissed-out expression

MALACHAT
We want to give you peace

ANGLE

Vicky figures that one out in a hurry She lunges back
upstairs tripping and stumbling in her haste

ANGLE
Malachai lets slip his pups of war

MALACHAT
Seize her

And with a gleeful shout the boys rush the stairs all at
once They fall over each other in their haste to do
Malachais bidding

INT MASTER BEDROOM

Vicky runs into the bedroom SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HER
LUNGS She slams the door and frantically pulls a CHEST OF
DRAWERS against it just as the first wave of boys arrives
Their initial charge is dulled by the unexpected weight of
the furniture but it is obvious they wont be stopped
Vicky still screaming pushes against the door with all her
might A HATCHET blasts through cutting her arm and
splintering the wood Vicky screams again and clutches at her
arm

ANGLE

The door gives way and the boys like giant black rats pour
into the room Vicky picks up a lamp and throws it at them
Sarah remains seated on the floor frozen staring fearfully
at the proceedings

ANGLE - SARAHS POV
Vicky is dragged literally kicking and screaming from the
room Her clothes are torn shes bleeding from the mouth and
arm and her face is badly bruised She has dropped the
crumpled picture on the floor
ANGLE
Sarah is left untouched and alone in the room She hasnt
moved through the whole thing Her wide terror-stricken eyes
tell the whole story He lip trembles

CUT TO
INT POLICE CHIEFS OFFICE
Burt is still there trying to figure the foreboding
scarecrow but has decided hes had enough of trying to
figure anything in Gatlin He turns around and sees a
picture on the wall behind him
THE PICTURE - BURTS POV
Its the VIRGIN MARY withering back from the onslaught of a
monstrous DRAGON Underneath is a caption AND WHEN THE
DRAGON SAW THAT HE WAS CAST UNTO THE EARTH HE PERSECUTED THE
WOMAN WHICH BROUGHT FORTH THE MAN CHILD
ANGLE - BURT - CU
As he reads the caption he senses something

ANGLE

He begins to move on but something about this picture pulls
at him He stares at it again

THE PICTURE - BURTS POV - CLOSEUP

His eyes study the dragon and then the woman and then the
threatening dragon again

ANGLE

And then Burt begins to run He flies out the door and into
the

CORRIDOR

Running as fast as his legs can carry him slipping on the
slick floor

THE STAIRCASE

He takes the stairs three at a time two flights and bursts
through the doors to the main lobby

THE LOBBY

Burt streaks across it and crashes through the door

EXT MUNICIPAL BLDG - LATE AFTERNOON

The first thing Burt sees stops him momentarily

THUNDERBIRD - BURTS POV

Its wrecked slashed battered the hood is up and the wires
ripped out and the engine is stuffed with corn husks and
plants Burt enters frame

ANGLE

Burt bolts down the stairs and past the car at a dead run
His path is a trip in time Various buildings he runs past
give us a brief glimpse of their terrible history

ANGLE

Burt runs past the library

QUICK FLASHBACK

A GROUP OF CHILDREN are burning its books in a big bonfire
outside DOZENS OF BOOKS are tossed out the windows by those
inside while the ones outside heap them on the flames ISAAC
supervises

ANGLE - BURT

He doesnt see this flashback of course but instead keeps
running His footsteps and the steady sound of his breathing
are the only things we hear He passes the REXALL

ANGLE - THE CHURCH

As Burt runs past the church we see another scene of horror
QUICK FLASHBACK - THE STEEPLE BELLTOWER

The minister is being manhandled by Malachai and ANOTHER
GROUP They have already beaten and bloodied him Now they
roughly put a noose around his neck He pleads with them in

vain They shove him out of the bell tower and he plummets
until the thick rope catches snapping his neck

He hangs there with his eyes bulging and his tongue sticking
out just like in Sarahs drawing

ANGLE - BURT

He remembers the drawing and stops for a beat to look up at
the steeple The rope still hangs but the noose is empty
Burt gulps at the air and continues on

ANGLE - THE PARK

Cutting through the park Burt leaps over THE POND

ANGLE - THE POND

A DOLL floats face down in the water

And finally Burt arrives at the house He sees the broken
windows and kicked-in front door

VICKY

INT MASTER BEDROOM

Burt charges in wild eyed and maniacal The sight that
greets him is Sarah who is shaking and whimpering in the
corner A LINE OF BLOOD shows where Vicky was dragged out of
the room Burt kneels next to the little girl

BURT
Where is she Where have they taken
her Please I

Sarah is severely traumatized at the moment She looks at
Burt blankly

BURT
(pleading)
If you have any idea youve got to
tell me Shes in danger
(MORE)

BURT (contd)

She could be your mother Please
Please

The urgency in his voice perhaps that last line reaches
something in Sarah She surfaces briefly

SARAH
Malachai

BURT
Who Malachai Where do I find him

Sarah stares at him for a moment then looks over to the
crumpled picture Vicky dropped just before she was taken
Burt grabs it and uncrumples it

THE PICTURE - BURTS POV

Just like all of Sarahs other drawings in crayon it shows
an obvious likeness of Vicky - same clothes and hairstyle
although in stick figure - crucified on a cross in the
cornfield There is blood dripping from several wounds
including the one we saw her get in the arm We cannot tell
if the Vicky in the pic-ture is dead or alive

ANGLE - BURT
As he reacts to the picture

BURT
No

DISSOLVE TO
EXT CORNFIELD - LATE AFTERNOON —- VICKY

CLOSEUP Vicky is lying on something flat on her back
somewhere in the cornfield Its a large clearing She is
only semi-conscious Bruised and bloody she drifts in and
out of awareness She seems to be hearing voices which we
also hear

MALACHAI (VO)
Does He speak to you Isaac

ISAAC (VO)
He speaks to me always but today
He is displeased

Vicky isnt sure whether this is just a bad dream She tosses
her head from side to side trying to awaken herself

ANGLE - MALACHAT and ISAAC

We now see that this is indeed no dream The two are there
with her

ISAAC
He is displeased with you
Malachai

MALACHAT

(nervous )
What have I done

ISAAC

(angry)
Question Him not in vain Do you
not know you did sacrifice Joseph
without an offering Did you not
spill the blood of the old man when
his oil and gasoline were still
useful to us

MALACHAT
We have our own fuel now In the
still From the corn

ISAAC
Shew not your pride Malachai We
have not enough

MALACHAT
(vindictive)
And is the Lord not displeased that
we have not offered Him Sarah and
Job

ISAAC
Sarah has the gift of Sight She
warned us of the coming of the
interlopers Question not my
judgment Malachai I am the giver
of his word

Malachai glowers at Isaac For the first time we see him
unafraid of the younger boy even a bit scorn-ful and
resentful

ANGLE - VICKY

She struggles to open her eyes and see where the voices are
coming from

ISAAC (VO)

Now go you and bring me the hus-
band Vde must offer them tonight
When Amos leaves us

Vicky suddenly feels herself being pulled jerked up into
the air She snaps out of her daze enough to see what is
going on around her

ANGLE

She is being raised into the air She sees Isaac below and
the departing Malachai There are several other CHILDREN
around helping with the erecting of her cross Only now
does she realize that she is tied to a large WOODEN
CRUCIFIX It is turned as its raised and she finds
herself

ANGLE - VICKYS POV
face to face with The Blue Man
ANGLE - VICKY
Her horror and revulsion are too intense even for a scream
She presses back as hard as she can against the cross back
away from her fate

CUT TO
EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE CORNFIELD —- DAY
Burt is running — along a wall of the corn frantically
screaming for Vicky He is hot tired and out of breath He
is also intensely determined He rips the corn plants out of
the way
ANOTHER ANGLE
Burt is lost or at least he doesnt know where to begin
All he knows is that Vicky may be out here somewhere
undergoing some unspeakable torture He tries another
direction
ANOTHER ANGLE
ANGLE — BURT
Hes pressing his way through another row The corn seems to
have thickened as if Burt was at the bottom of a giant

green pool There are no longer discernible rows just one
giant wall of corn

ANGLE

The plants themselves are beginning to resist Burt
physically Leaves swat him in the face One cuts him with
its razor edge A stalk bends over in his path wrapping
itself around him Burt is getting panicky but mentally
fighting the idea that this stuff has a will of its own He
finally loosens the tenacious stalk

BURT
Jesus Christ

He struggles on sure of only one thing His will to find
Vicky And then he spots something that may help him

ANGLE - CHURCH STEEPLE - BURTS POV

He spots the highest place in Gatlin from where he can look
out over the entire cornfield

ANGLE - EDGE OF THE FIELD

Burt emerges from the corn fighting his way to the very

last He is plastered with plants - leaves silk husks -

and is bloody and exhausted He tears the stuff off of him

He finds himself next to a BARN and decides to check it out

EXT BARN - LATE AFTERNOON

It is quite large made out of wood and painted red THE

DOORS ARE OPEN so Burt approaches carefully There is no

sign of anyone about

ANGLE - BURT - STALKERS POV

Someone is watching Burt as he walks towards the barn He is

still brushing corn plants off himself The watcher makes no

move towards him but keeps pas with him at a distance

INT BARN

Burt pokes his head in to make sure no one is there
FLASHBACK TO

INT BARN

Same POV as Burts but three years ago At first we think

this is what Burt is seeing just as in the Municipal

Building but we will quickly realize it is from the past

Police Chief Hotchkiss — sweating disheveled and out of
breath — is alone in the barn

He looks at A PAGE FROM A BOOK very briefly then stuffs the
piece of paper in his shirt pocket

ANGLE

He goes to a STILL which is housed in the barn Next to it
are SEVERAL 500 GALLON METAL CONTAINERS marked GASOHOL He
finds some HOSES cuts off the metal ring fastners at the
ends and connects them to the spigot on one of the drums
Hes starting to unwind the hose out of the barn when

ANGLE

Suddenly hes jumped by SEVERAL TEENAGE BOYS They beat him
unconscious with ax handles but not until after a fierce
struggle During the melee his shirt is ripped and the
piece of paper falls to the ground

ANGLE

After the boys have dragged their unconscious victim away a

figure steps into the barn and picks up the paper It is
Job

PRESENT TIME
INT BARN
Burt looks around He sees the gasohol drums the still A
FAIRLY MODERN TRACTOR and basic FARM IMPLEMENTS But no
Vicky He heads to the church
EXT GATLIN - LATE AFTERNOON
Burt is nearing the church
ANGLE - BURT - STALKERS POV
Again we see Burt through the eyes of whomever is stalking
him maintaining that careful respectful distance Burt
starts to go in the front then thinks better of it and walks
around the side We follow Burt from THIS POV
ANGLE

Burt creeps up the back steps to the church and listens at
the door for a beat then tries the handle Its open

INT CHURCH - CORRIDOR

Burt enters from behind the pulpit He walks along a narrow
CORRIDOR stops and looks into the sanctuary

FLASHBACK TO

CHURCH SANCTUARY - (BURTS POV)

The same place Burt is looking at only three years prior
The gray haired MINISTER whom we saw depicted in one of
Sarahs drawings and also later hanged from the steeple is
kneeling in prayer at the pulpit Isaac Malachai and their
cohorts walk up behind him

ANGLE

The Minister is unafraid at this moment He has been
reading from his BIBLE and rises and turns on the Children
with a defiant stare He turns the book around and holds it
up to Isaac

THE BIBLE - ISAACS POV
It is open to THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS A page is missing
ANGLE

Isaac holds out his hand and Malachai hurries to fetch him
ANOTHER BIBLE Isaac opens this one to the corre-sponding
page and reads for a beat He looks up at the Minister who
says something to him which we do not hear Whatever it is
Isaac sneers at the older man He takes something out of his
pocket and holds it up for the Minister

THE POLICE CHIEFS BADGE - MINISTERS POV

Unmistakably the real thing It says CHIEF OF POLICE and at
the bottom GATLIN

ANGLE

The Minister is shaken Isaac rips the page out of the Bible
and crumples it dropping it to the floor The Minister backs
up but the Children of the Corn are upon him Weve already
seen what happened next

PRESENT TIME
INT CHURCH - BURTS POV

The first thing Burt sees is the destruction even more
vandalism than in the Municipal Building The ICONS have
been chipped broken and painted upon slogans have been
painted on the walls in red AND YE SHALL WORSHIP NO FALSE
GODS BEFORE HIM and AND A CHILD SHALL LEAD THEM cornshocks
and plants have been heaped everywhere and THE CHRIST FIGURE
has been completely redone in corn - a crown of corn
cornsilk for hair etc

ANGLE

And much to Hurts surprise there are PEOPLE He hides in
the shadows A CEREMONY is taking place Rachel Deigan the
pregnant girl who watched Burt drive by on his way to the
Municipal Building is there with her TWO YOUNG CHILDREN
Behind them filling the first few pews are a DOZEN
ONLOOKERS none of whom are older than 18 They are all
watching as AMOS DEIGAN a dark-haired boy of 19 is made
ready for a very special occasion He seems almost ina
trance and gives his wife a blissful unseeing smile

ANGLE

A BLACK ROBED GIRL steps up to him and offers him a COB-
HANDLED KNIFE and a BOWL hollowed out of another cob Deigan
takes these and makes an incision in his chest over his
heart He begins to draw a PENTAGRAM

ANGLE - BURT

He is alternately fascinated horrified and revolted by what
he sees He is hardly able to restrain himself from stopping
Amos

ANGLE

Amos finishes the last line of the symbol He hands the girl
back the knife and begins squeezing his blood into the bowl
When he has SEVERAL TABLESPOONS the girl wipes the wound and
hands him a QUILL PEN and a SCROLL She holds the scroll
unfurled while he dips the pen in his blood and writes
something down The girl takes the pen and the scroll away
when hes done

ANGLE

Deigan then turns to his family The congregation begins to
hum as he offers the bowl to his wife She tastes it without
hesitation then prepares to give some to the children

ANGLE

At that point Burt can stand it no longer He jumps out
from his hiding place

BURT
No

He continues forward stopping only at the edge of the
pulpit

BURT
Are you out of your minds What
the hell do you think youre doing

ANGLE

The room is dead silent Everyone stares at him with hateful
eyes everyone except Amos He is too blissed out He gives
Burt the same vacant look he gave his wife

AMOS
Todays my birthday

BURT
Youve got a pretty sick way of
celebrating it

He turns on Rachel He has suddenly assumed the role of a
reproachful parent

BURT
And you Are these your children
You ought to be locked up for even
allowing them to see this much
less

The black robed girl shouts at him

GIRL
Silence interloper Your presence
does profane this holy place He
will reckon with you I

BURT
Well thats fine whoever he is
I happen to be a doctor Maybe
hed like to discuss the medical
ramifications of carving yourself
up with an unsanitary object not to
mention what it would do to those
kids to drink it

Amos is confused Someone is suddenly condemning what should
have been his hour of triumph

AMOS
But it is as it should be As it
is written

GIRL
Speak you no more to him Amos He
is an Unbeliever
94

She looks to one of the boys in the pews

GIRL
Hurry Bring IsaacNo Malachai

The boy rushes out Burt ignores this Hes making some
progress with Amos

BURT
What do you mean ‘As it is
written Written where

Amos looks at the scroll
ANGLE

The scroll is resting on a ceremonial TABLE The knife lies
next to it Burt makes a move for the scroll just as the
girlpriestess grabs for it She gets the scroll first but
Burt gets her wrist He is a different Burt now a man who
has been pushed too far and is desperate He twists her arm
forcefully and takes the scroll from her

ANGLE

Several of the OLDER BOYS in the congregation walk forward
Burt eyes them aggressively and they hesitate He goes back
to the scroll

THE SCROLL - BURTS POV

He unfurls it revealing a list of names all written in
blood like Amos The difference is that theirs are dried
and brown his is fresh red Beside each name is a birthdate
and date of death ZEPENIAH KIRK (GEORGE) B OCT 14 1963
oct 14 1982 YEMEN HOLLIS (EDWARD) B JAN 5 1964 JAN

Burt looks at Amos in confusion

BURT
I dont understand These kids all

AMOS

first night of our 19th year Night

BURT
And what happens when you go to
him

ANGLE
The BOY who ran out for Malachai bursts back in

BOY
Malachai comes

ANGLE
The girlpriestess commands the others

GIRL
Seize him Dont let him escape

Burt starts to back up as the emboldened youths surge
forward The girl picks up the ceremonial knife and plunges
it into Burts right shoulder He staggers backwards and
falls into

ANGLE

A PILE OF BIBLES They are all open to a particular spot -
REVELATIONS - AND A PAGE HAS BEEN TORN OUT of each one at
this spot

ANGLE

Burt yanks the knife out of his shoulder grimacing in pain
The onrushing youths stop when he points the knife at them

BURT
(enraged)
Is this your religion

He picks up one of the bibles with his left hand throws it at
them and another and another until he pauses once noticing
the missing page

BURT
What did you do Rip out the ten
commandments or just rearrange
them to suit your needs

He rises to his feet but staggers from pain and loss of
blood The boys inch forward Burt stops again threatening
them with the knife He backs out of the church

EXT CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

Burt exits the rear doorand begins to run He tosses
away the knife After a BEAT the hordes come running after
him The girlpriestess is last exhorting them

GIRL
Seize him Dont let him escape

ANGLE - BURT - STALKERS POV

Whoever this is who has been stalking Burt watches him run
towards the main part of town The stalker ducks away
abruptly hurrying himself to keep up

ANGLE

Burt is running through town He turns down a side street
only to find Malachai and his bunch running towards him Burt
does an about face and heads the other way narrowly
avoiding the group that chased him out of the church

ANGLE

Burt runs and runs turning errantly whichever street or way
presents itself Finally he has to stop for breath He
quickly finds himself surrounded by a HALF DOZEN BOYS all of
them armed

ANGLE

Burt stares them down turning all around so that he can see
if and when any of them make their move The boys are
cautious Burt is at least ten years older than the oldest
of them and he isnt any pushover He is a wounded
desperate adult and the boys sense this

BURT
Im warning you guys This isnt a
game First one of you comes near
mes gonna get his head knocked
off

CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES These are children The murder in
their eyes is so incongruous with their physical selves that
it is hard to imagine they are as deadly as weve seen them
be

ANGLE

One of them charges Burt and swings a sickle Burt blocks it
and knees him in the groin

As the boy doubles over Burt pounds him between the shoulder
blades sending him to the ground Burt will make ingenious
use of his medical knowledge before this day is over He
picks up the sickle and swings it just in time to send two
more attackers scurrying backwards

BURT
God damn it Now keep away from
me

He walks towards them resolutely They give ground letting
him pass But just as he seems to be free

ANGLE
Malachai and his little Huns round the corner

BURT
Shit

They explode after him shouting and cheering in their
killing frenzy Burt takes off

ANGLE - OUTSIDE MUNICIPAL BUILDING

Burt shows some agility wounded shoulder and all He catches
the bottom of the fire escape after a running leap which only
the tallest of his pursuers can match Using his left hand
he pulls himself up and clatters

up the metal stairs He carries the sickle in his belt

ANGLE

Some of the taller boys follow him others stream around to
the front entrance

runs across it and without stopping jumps to

SKELETAL BODIES of the former adults of Gatlin He lands face
first in the grisly mess He gasps and swoons from the sight
and smell He pauses until he hears the shouts behind him

ANGLE - BURTS POV
Several of the OLDER AND LARGER BOYS led by Malachai have

reached the roof of the Municipal Building They are running
towards the jump-gap

ANGLE

Burt notices that the ARMS AND LEGS of several of the bodies
around him are jutting up at strange angles With several
swift angular strokes he cuts a number of these into SHARP
BONY SPIKES and points them towards where his pursuers will
be coming from He lops a final HAND off at the wrist and
positions the protruding bone

BURT
(to the corpse)
Thanks for the hand

He runs to the edge of the Rexall roof The only way off is
to jump about 20 feet down He looks back

ANGLE - BURTS POV

The first assault wave from the Municipal roof lands in the
pile of bodies after clearing the jump One boy falls
squarely on one of the spikes and is im-paled Malachai
gets one through the leg and falls in agony Two other boys
however land with no problem although they first run to
check on Malachai

ANGLE

Burt climbs over the edge of the Rexall roof and hangs as far
as he can before dropping He falls into a tuck-and-roll
coming out of it with just a slightly sprained ankle
Suddenly bottles knives rocks and other weapons begin to
rain down upon him

ANGLE

With glass breaking all around and the metal weapons striking
the pavement by his feet Burt hobbles away as fast as he
can

ANGLE - REXALL ROOF

The pursuers have already formed a chain and are lowering
their horde to the sidewalk

The person who has been stalking Burt sees a new line of

Children take up the pursuit Burt heads to the left and so
does the stalker

Burt uses a 25-yard distance between him and the Huns to stop
and gulp air Hes looking back waiting for the first sight
of the demons when he hears something from above

UPPER WINDOW - BURTS POV

TWO GIRLS dressed in drab gray dresses have opened the
window above him and are pouring something out of a kettle
towards him ONE OF THEM IS PREGNANT

ANGLE

Burt dives out of the way barely avoiding several gallons of
BOILING CORN OIL He looks up at the girls in disbelief
They stare down at him in blind hatred

ANGLE

The boys are coming and its time for Burt to flee He runs

past more houses Hes about to run back into the cornfield
when somebody calls to him

JOB
Hey Mister Over here

The size age and innocence of the boy stop Burt
ANGLE - JOB - BURTS POV

Burt looks back and sees the alternative He decides to
chance it and runs after the boy

BURT
Who are you

JOB
Cmon

They run into the backyard of the house next door This is

Job leads Burt to a pair of outside cellar doors one of
which is open The little boy runs down them like the White
Rabbit Burt follows like Alice

INT CELLAR

Theres danger here Its dark and Burts eyes are
acclimated to the light He sees Job reach up and close the
door over them then switch on a flashlight

supplies - cots food (canned and dried) medical supplies
books tools etc - everything a survivalist would stock
for about three months Sarah is sitting at a small table
staring at Burt She is in her adult costume also Burt
scans the room with his eyes finally coming back to the
little boy in the strange outfit who says ecstatically

I think not Isaac I You are the
one who has lost favor with Him He
is a God of blood and sacrifice
not ceremony

ISAAC
(shouting)
Liesl Sacrilege Down on your
knees heretic

Malachai lashes out with his fist and knocks Isaac to the
ground Malachai stands over him The new Usurper

MALACHAT
Command me not Isaac for you have
grown prideful and apart from us
He Who Walks Behind the Rows will
decide your fate

Isaac dripping with venom and utter hatred for Malachai
turns on the assembled group He screams invectives

ISAAC
Dont just stand there Seize him
Punish him Cut him down I
command you I am the Word and the
Giver of His Laws

(MORE)

ISAAC (contd)
Disobedience to me is disobedience
to Him He Who Walks Behind the
Rows and He will slay you with a
thousand times a thousand deaths
each more horrible than the last

Isaacs words fall on deaf ears or at least changed minds
The boys gather around Malachai not to seize him but to
accept him as their new leader Malachai accepts the role
matter-of-factly

MALACHAT
Cut the woman down Put Isaac in
her place

ISAAC
No You dare not

MALACHAT
We will see how he favors you

Isaac is seized and dragged to Vickys cross

ISAAC
No You blaspheme He will punish
you The jaws of Hell will devour
you All of you

He struggles violently but in vain Vicky is cut down from
the cross Malachai watches with vengeful approval as Isaac
is put in her place

ANGLE

A PROCESSION enters the clearing It is Amos followed by
his wife and children escorted by candle bearing Children of
the Corn Amos steps forward that glazed look in his eyes

AMOS
Im ready to celebrate my birthday

MALACHAT
We have a surprise for you Amos
Isaac is going to keep you company
Amos Malachai and the rest look towards the cross

ANGLE

Isaac is on the cross still kicking struggling and
shouting

ISAAC
Malachai He will punish you He
will punish all of you He will
not forgive you None of you will
be forgiven

INT BOMB SHELTER

Burt is finishing bandaging his shoulder wound with the
available medical supplies

BURT

BURT

Whose time What are you talking
about

Sarah hands him a picture from her stack Burt walks over to
the table where shes sitting

ANGLE - THE PICTURE - BURTS POV

It is a picture he and we have seen It shows the figure of
He Who Walks Behind the Rows with that caption underneath

WIDE ANGLE
He hands her back the picture
BURT

JOB

BURT
(sincere)

As he continues with Burt listening intently we
DISSOLVE TO
EXT GATLIN - DUSK
Night is falling Theres a small glimmer of sun on the

horizon sinking fast Malachai looks around He calls out
to his unseen foe

MALACHAT
Outlander We have your woman She
still lives

And indeed she does CAMERA WIDENS TO INCLUDE VICKY who is
bound and in Malachai s grasp About TWENTY BOYS are
milling about waiting to do their part if Burt should come

MALACHAT
(to a group)
Five of you go through the town
Call to him Tell him we wait

CUT TO
INT BOMB SHELTER

Job is finishing telling Burt the story His words should
sound familiar

BURT
Then it was Malachai who killed the
old man at the gas station

JOB
Uh huh I think his name was Mr
Diehl but once I heard Malachai
say it was Judas

BURT
(pleading)
Job youve got to take me to that
clearing I think it was Malachai
has taken Vicky and if I dont get
there soon Im afraid shes going
to wind up like Mr Diehl

Job ponders very seriously for a moment

JOB
Alright

CUT TO
EXT GATLIN - DUSK
Malachai is still calling to Burt baiting him with Vicky
MALACHAT

Outlander Maybe you dont hear
well Hows this

He pulls the knife across Vickys face cutting her cheek
She screams

VICKY
Burt Dont

Malachai clasps a hand over her mouth muffling her warning

MALACHAT
Her blood will spill Outlander
Unless you give yourself up unto
Him

ANGLE - BURT JOB and SARAH

The three emerge from the bomb shelter and begin running
towards the corn They cross the street and run to where the
field is visible Something jerks Burt to a sudden halt

ANGLE - BURTS POV - LONG LENS

In the distance near the barn by the cornfield Malachai is
still holding Vicky

MALACHAT
We wont wait much longer
Outlander It is coming Night and
Night is His time

ANGLE

Burt has to resist the temptation to run directly to Vickys
aid Job and Sarah now see what he is looking at

JOB
(hissing)
Malachai
(then childlike)
Hes in trouble now

BURT
Job you and Sarah find a place to
hide If anything happens to me
you head out of town as fast as you
can Stay on the road and dont
stop until you reach Hemingford
Now go on

Burt hasnt stopped looking at Vicky the whole time He runs
OFF SCREEN leaving Job and Sarah watching him go

CUT TO

EXT THE CORNFIELD - NIGHTFALL

Night comes and night is His time The corn begins to
rustle until it actually seems to tremble

ANGLE

He Who Walks Behind the Rows is on the move casting a black
shadow against the blackening sky The corn bends to His
will flattening on all sides as the God surges forward

ANGLE - THE CLEARING —- ISAAC

Isaac from his high vantage point sees whats happening to
the corn Terror fills his face

ANGLE - AMOS

Amos has been sitting cross-legged in the clearing Waiting
Staring off into a private place He senses the approaching
force and stands up He is smiling

AMOS
Its Him Hes come for me Hes
come to welcome me

He looks into the sky all about but cannot see any-thing
Searching he wanders out of the clearing and into the rows
His calling fades in the wind

AMOS
I am here Lord Im ready

CAMERA ZOOMS IN TO ISAAC

Whimpering and cowering like the 14- year old boy that he is
Isaac watches as Amos disappears into the corn

CUT TO
EXT NEAR THE BARN —- NIGHTFALL
An eerie wind is beginning to blow somewhat like the wind on
the outer edge of the eye of the storm which signals the end
of the calm and the beginning of the apocalypse In the
BACKGROUND the corn is breezing wildly Debris tumbleweeds
parts of corn plants etc are blowing across Gatlin

ANGLE - BURT

He is creeping up on Malachai with quick bursts of speed from
cover to cover

He runs from the back of A HOUSE to A FIXTURE OF PIPES AND
TUBING that leads out into the cornfield

ANGLE - THE FIXTURE - CLOSEUP

Theres a CEMENT APRON around the fixture and a removable

COVER in the cement Some WHITE LETTERING has been painted
on the side of one of the pipes SPRINKLER PUMPS 5 AND 6
Burt looks out to where the tubing leads and sees

ANGLE - THE CORNFIELD

Even in the dark he can make out the shape of TWO GIANT
SPRINKLERS

ANGLE

There is some HOSE and TUBING lying around the fixture Burt
picks up a length of the metal tubing and hefts it in his
hand He looks at Malachai differently now Not more than 50
feet separates them

ANGLE - BURT INCLUDING MALACHAT and OTHERS

Before Burt can make his move A NOISE from the corn-field
distracts everybody All heads turn towards it They can see
nothing only hear A SCREAM

CUT TO
EXT THE CLEARING - SAME TIME

Isaac is ashen and sweating His eyes are filled with
unspeakable horror as he listens to the sound of Amos
screaming just beyond him in the corn That area of the corn
is being torn up by something tremendous There are terrible
beastly howls around Amos feeble screams

ANGLE

A SOUND OF TEARING AND BREAKING followed by a GURGLING
quiets that area of the corn momentarily Isaac waits and
listens straining to see Suddenly something is heaved
into the clearing from the field It looks like a sack or
what might once have been a body It is wearing the remnants
of Amos clothes As it lands in a heap it splatters blood
on Isaac

ANGLE
A shadow visible even in the dark because it is blacker than

the night falls over Isaac He is looking straight up at
something immense He begs and pleads with it like a child

ISAAC
II did as you commandedI was
goodI swear it

His eyes widen further if that is possible as the shadow
descends upon him

ISAAC
NOOOOO00000

CUT TO
EXT NEAR THE BARN —- SAME TIME

Even more wind now almost a gale There is a single giant
death cloud over Gatlin Burt uses the oppor-tunity to
attack Malachai and the others are so preoccupied with
whats going on out in the cornfield that theyve allowed
themselves to be caught off guard

ANGLE

Vicky sees Burt charging She jerks her body around so that
Malachai’s back is turned into Burt Burt slugs him with the
pipe and butts him with his good shoulder Malachai sprawls
to the ground

BURT
(to Vicky)
Run

ANGLE - THE FIFE FIXTURE

Job and Sarah have been trailing Burt They run from the
back of the same house he did to the same sprinkler fixture
They watch excitedly as he takes on Malachai

ANGLE

Vicky has run to the barn Burt is trying to catch up to her
but the circle of boys has closed around him He lashes out
with the pipe scattering some of them in front but suddenly
his knees go out from under him as Malachai tackles him from
behind They roll in the dirt Malachai pressing down with
his knife while Burt tries to resist him with his left hand
The boys do not intercede sensing this is Malachais fight
They are also a bit intimidated by Burt Hes the first
man many of them have had to deal with in some time

ANGLE

Burt bucks Malachai with his leg giving himself-just enough
time and room to swat him across the face with the pipe

Malachai goes over on his back and Burt is instantly on top
of him He whacks the knife out of the boys hand then grabs
him by the throat with his right hand (the bad shoulder side)
and raises the pipe over his head He is completely in
control of his dazed adversary Malachais life is in his
hands

ANGLE

Burt hesitates He looks around at the circle of boys They
dont know what to do Burts eyes are white hot with
accusation

BURT
Is this what you want Another
killing Is this what your Isaac
preaches

And almost as if in response they hear Isaacs scream It is
so inhuman that it distracts everyone including Burt The
scream is followed by ANOTHER NOISE perhaps even more
frightening and certainly less human Its like the growl of
a lion only much deeper and more potent like water draining
into a thousand foot well It is a sound that is at once
recognizable and yet unlike any we have ever heard It
should chill us to the bone

ANGLE

SEVERAL OF THE BOYS runs away so frightened are they by this
declaration from the cornfield Burt rises to his feet
staring out at the darkness in awe and wonder He forgets
about Malachai which is a mistake and begins instinctively
to move towards the barn for Vicky

ANGLE

Malachai scrambles to his knees He looks at the remaining
boys

MALACHAT
Get him Kill him

Nobody makes a move Malachai is stunned that they would
disobey him but he is too filled with hate to worry about
that now He sees his knife on the ground and picks it up
Rising he prepares to throw it into Burts back But just
as he does

ANGLE

A VOICE calls out to him It does not sound human

ISAAC
Malachai

Burt hears it too and turns around to see Malachai the
remaining Children and the figure who has stepped out of the
corn and is walking towards them

ANGLE —- ISAAC

It is not Isaac but once it was This is a demon Isaac a
hideous perversion of what used to be a little boy who was
possessed by a fanatical religion Much of his skin has been
eaten away - gnawed to the bone by some beast of nightmares
His eyes are huge globes staring at something not of this
world as he is not any longer His hair the wisps of it
that are left seem more like corn leaves and corn silk and
indeed there is a greenish tinge to what little skin he has
left His clothes are plastered with corn plants and smeared
with kernels His hands reaching outstretched for Malachai
are bone

ISAAC
He wants you too Malachai He
wants you too

ANGLE

The half dozen Children left run past Burt into the barn A
couple remain behind him and watch from the safety of his
presence

ANGLE —- MALACHAT

He starts backing up Alone The look on his face is not
demonstrable terror or horror or fright It is way beyond
that so far that there is little emotion left with which to
express what it is Hes trembling and sweating profusely
His hands and feet are like lead He tries to flee from the
oncoming demon but he cant seem to move

ANGLE

Isaac catches up to Malachai hissing and growling like an
animal as he leaps upon him Malachai buries his knife up to
the hilt in Isaacs chest but it doesnt even faze the
smaller boy Isaac is already long since dead He drags
Malachai back into the corn with irresistible strength
Malachais screams echo through the town

ANGLE

Burt turns to the barn and sees that Vicky has witnessed this
spectacle

The Children who ran into the barn are huddled around her
She meets Burt halfway to the barn and they embrace
passionately

BURT
Thank God youre alright

Job and Sarah come running over to them Theyre terribly

upset by what theyve just seen and they cling to Burt and

Vicky But just when you thought it was safe to go back in
the corn

THE HOWL OF THE BEAST RISES OUT OF THE FIELD

ANGLE

Burt Vicky and the children are physically jarred by the
power of the roar The monstrous sounds continue as lights
and lightning shatter the darkness accompanied by a raging
wind that tosses debris in every direction Its as if the
monster is going to destroy the entire town

ANGLE

Our family hurries to the relative safety of the barn

INT BARN

Burt Vicky Job and Sarah join the other six Children who
are huddled in here frightened out of their wits

VICKY
What do we do

BURT
I dont know If I knew what it was
out there maybe I could tell you

JOB
Its He Who Walks Behind the Rows

VICKY
What if we run for it Try to make
it to the road

Burt looks at the children and Vickys wounds
BURT
I think were safer here at least

for the time being

They listen as the horrendous noises continue outside Things
are slamming up against the barn walls

Without warning one of the planks explodes The wind howls
in muffling their screams of terror
ANGLE
Burt goes to Job Something has to be done
BURT
Job has anybody ever tried to hurt
the monster Any of the parents or

adults before they were

Job remembers what happened to them To his parents

JOB
(quietly)
The Blue Man
BURT
Whos the Blue Man What did he
do
JOB

Officer Hotchkiss The Chief of
Police He came down here after he
talked to the minister He was
reading a page torn out of the
bible And then he was doing
something with the still

BURT
What stopped him

JOB
Malachai

BURT

Why was he reading from the bible
What was it

Job reaches into his pocket He pulls out a COMPASS a PEN
KNIFE a RABBITS FOOT KEY CHAIN TWO BASEBALL CARDS and A
WALLET He pores through a number of PAPERS he has in the
wallet Outside the sounds of Armageddon The barn rocks
and sways to the side

BURT
Hurry up Job

Job finally finds what hes looking for He hands Burt the
page from three years ago

ANGLE - THE PAGE - BURTS POV

Its from REVELATIONS CHAPTER 20 VERSE 10 is circled in
RED

2010
And the devil that deceived them
was cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone where the beast and the
false prophet are and shall be
tormented day and night for ever
and ever

Burt remembers something

QUICK FLASHBACK
TO

INT CHURCH

Just after the black-robed girl stabbed Burt and he fell into
the pile of bibles he noticed a page had been torn from each
of them

PRESENT TIME

INT BARN

ANGLE
Burt fights his frustration He
looks at Vicky who has read the
page over his shoulder

BURT
I dont know what it means

Another plank explodes And another They duck out of the
way of the splintering boards

BURT
(shouting to Job)
What was the Blue Man doing at the
still

JOB
He hooked the hose up to it and was
rolling it out

Burt ponders
BURT

Lake of fireFire He must have
been trying to burn the field
VICKY
But how

BURT
With theNever mind

Burt springs into action He becomes the Field General of
this motley fighting force

BURT
You kids I Get me all the hoses you
can find Job Sarah find a glass
bottle a soda pop bottle if you
can Vicky come here

Burt leads Vicky over to the GASOHOL DRUMS He takes the hose
from one of the kids It wont connect to the spigot

BURT
(to kid)
Give me your knife

The innocent looking boy hands Burt a mean looking knife
Burt hands it to Vicky and holds up the hose

BURT
Cut it

She does so Burt jams the end onto the spigot

BURT
(to Vicky)
Youre going to have to hold this
tight when I go out there

VICKY
Where What Are you crazy

Burt ignores her He barks an order at the kids

BURT
Connect those hoses Hurry

Job arrives with an empty ancient bottle of PEPSI Burt
takes the hose off the spigot long enough to fill the bottle
with gasohol He rips part of Jobs shirt and stuffs the rag
into the bottle Job protests

JOB
Hey
Burt smiles and touches the boys cheek as he shakes the
bottle thoroughly wetting the rag with the gasohol He
turns to Vicky and gives her a hard sudden kiss

BURT
I love you Remember to keep that
hose on tight

He jams it up against the spigot and opens the valve Vicky
doesnt know what to say so she says nothing

ANGLE

Burt lights the rag with his cigarette lighter picks up the
hose from which gasohol is beginning to pour out and exits
the barn

EXT GATLIN - NIGHT

A scene worthy of the sounds we have just heard from inside
the barn Theres a gale force wind blowing out of the
cornfield Wood glass corn - all kinds of debris - are
being tossed about The sky is dark but darker over the
cornfield except for the middle which is glowing and
sparking The houses and buildings of Gatlin are coming
apart both from the wind and the noise that incredible and
chilling roar emanating from the cornfield

ANGLE

Burt runs with the hose and the Molotov cocktail towards the
sprinkler pump fixture An even more savage roar goes up
from the monster Things begin to come out of the field
shot as if from cannons right at Burt

ANGLE

At first the corn plants seem like debris They whip around
Burts legs tripping him and around his arms While hes
struggling more are piling on top of him Hes becoming
entangled in a net Panic stricken Burt struggles to free
himself Hes tearing at the stalks when he sees

ANGLE - THE BLUE MAN AND HIS CROSS

The crucifix and its dead occupant are about to smash Burt
into the ground He rolls out of the way just in time
barely avoiding the ten foot wooden icon

But he is still entangled in the corn stalks Job suddenly
appears with a knife He starts hacking away at the stalks
They bleed and the monster howls in protest

ANGLE
Burt is free He picks up the hose and cocktail

BURT
Get back to the barn

He runs forward Job stays right where he is not wanting to
abandon Burt

ANGLE

Burt is almost at the pump when THE BODIES OF ISAAC AND
MALACHI — whats left of them — are now flung upon him Half
skeletons half decaying flesh they entangle him ina
lifeless grappler hold Burt struggles to rid himself of
them and finds it isnt that easy

ANGLE — JOB
He stands frozen watching in horror
ANGLE — THE CORNFIELD

And now the monster itself rears its head and bellows its
intent It is immense formless a vision of death

ANGLE

Burt is working feverishly He opens the metal cover on the
pump and tries to unscrew its connecting valve The thing
wont budge The hose is spilling gallons of gasohol by the
second and is in danger of running out He grabs another
piece of loose tubing and uses it as a lever The valve
finally opens Job arrives

EXT CORNFIELD — NIGHT

The monster moves slowly steadly inexorably towards Burt
and Job

ANGLE

Burt jams the hose into the valve He throws the switch
and

ANGLE - CORNFIELD - NEAR THE SPRINKLERS

-Nothing happens The monster approaches Burt and Job
will never make it back to the barn The Beast is too close
But then the sprinklers begin to move kicked to life by the
sudden increase in pressure They begin to spew gasohol over
the sacred corn

ANGLE

The Beast is enraged It looses a deafening roar of protest
and pain It lifts the giant sprinklers into the air like
they were toys and thrashes them but as it does so it only
gets more of the fluid on the corn and also on itself
ANGLE - BURT and JOB

Burt picks up the Molotov cocktail and heaves it Within the
motion though he is jolted by the forgotten pain in his
wounded shoulder

ANGLE

The Molotov cocktail falls far short of its target In fact
it doesnt even break

ANGLE
Burt clutching his wound stares in shock

BURT
Oh no

Job realizing what has happened begins to run straight into
the corn

BURT
Job NO COME BACK

ANGLE
Job is intent His little body darts into the rows
ANGLE
The monster starts towards the boy
ANGLE
Burt starts towards the field screaming to Job in vain
BURT
JOB RUN ITS COMING AFTER
YOU
ANGLE - BETWEEN THE ROWS - JOB

Job flies past the stalks He spots the still-burning
cocktail

ANGLE - BURT

He scours the field with his eyes Despair racks his body
As the Beast comes within 50 yards its immense shadow falls
over him Burt steps back his eyes drawn upwards He is
about to die and he knows it

ANGLE

Job emerges from the cornfield He hands the flaming Molotov
cocktail to Burt who is so happy to see him that he forgets
himself for a moment He looks at the boy and then
incredulously at the bomb

ANGLE - JOB

He waits expectantly for Burt to throw it again

ANGLE

Burt heaves the cocktail as hard and as high as he can It
takes a second for it to land and then

BAROOOM

THE CORNFIELD EXPLODES IN FLAME

becoming a veritable LAKE OF FIRE The sky turns a fiery
orange-red THE BEAST HOWLS EVEN LOUDER registering its pain
and rage

ANGLE

Vicky and the rest of the children venture a look so great
is the noise and the heat

VICKY
(seeing the flames)
Oh my God Buuuurrrrrt
She goes running to him all of the Children following

ANGLE

Burt and Job have been running towards the barn They join
the others and all continue their retreat to a safer place

ANGLE

They stop near the edge of town and look back on the
destruction

THE CORNFIELD - THEIR POV

The Devil is in his Hell As the flames consume the field A
MUCH BRIGHTER AND MORE INTENSE FIRE accompanied by tortured
screaming breaks off from the general one The Beast is
outlined and defined by this fire within the fire It burns
brighter and brighter brilliantly for a moment and then
IMPLODES IN ON ITSELF turning into a vortex that disappears
down into the earth

ANGLE

Burt Vicky Job and Sarah and all of the others watch the
glow from the continuing flames casting a healing light on
their faces Vicky is leaning against Burt In her hand she
is still clutching the page from Revelations
