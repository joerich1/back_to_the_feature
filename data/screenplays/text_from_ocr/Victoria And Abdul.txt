by Shrabani Basu
Words appear on screen

AGRA 1886
BRITAIN HAS FORMALLY RULED INDIA
FOR TWENTY-EIGHT YEARS

INT ABDUL’S ROOM INDIA

A darkened room Someone is moving in the darkness Then the
shutters of the room are thrown wide open and the blinding light
reveals Abdul twenty-four smiling into the sun — we hear sound of
the muezzin’s call to prayer in the distance

EXT ROOF TOP AGRA

Abdul praying in the glorious sunshine We see all of Agra below him
the Taj Mahal in the distance

EXT STREET AGRA

Abdul rushes out of a squalid doorway into the bustle of the street

As he hurries through the jammed streets he acknowledges people as
he goes making his way past the lame and sick through crowds spice
stalls Suddenly he accidentally bumps into a white colonial officer

OFFICER
Idiot

The officer has already turned away so Abdul hurries on through the
dusty streets

EXT AGRA GAOL THE SAME

Donkeys a dog pisses on the wall Abdul hurries in
INT AGRA GAOL

Abdul bows to the guard enthusiastically The lugubrious guard
unlocks several locks on the rusting iron gate The door slams shut

Abdul hurries along the corridor We see pitiful inmates all at looms
making carpets watched by bored unshaven guards

Abdul rushes to his high desk and starts on the Sisyphean task of
compiling the prison ledgers with huge concentration Abdul looks up to
see the prison guard

GUARD
Tyler wants to see you Now

INT TYLER’S OFFICE THE SAME

A faded mildewed monochrome of a young Queen Victoria on the wall
Abdul is underneath looking nervously at Tyler the Prison Governor

TYLER
Ah Mr Karim I wanted to speak to you about the carpets
we sent to the Exhibition

ABDUL
There is problem sir

TYLER
No No The carpets went down very well In fact the
Governor General has received a letter from the Royal
Household thanking him personally The whole thing’s been
such a success he has decided to present the Queen with a
mohar as part of the Jubilee

ABDUL
A mohar sir

TYLER
A mohar Apparently it’s a sort of ceremonial coin rather
like a medal I have been asked to find someone tall to
present it Well you’re the tallest person here

ABDUL
Mr Tyler When will she be arriving sir
TYLER
Not in Agra In England

ABDUL
England

TYLER
Youll present the mohar at an official function Like an
equerry

ABDUL
On a horse

TYLER
I don’t think there’ll be a horse

ABDUL
An equerry always has a horse Mr Tyler sir

TYLER
Well maybe not like an equerry exactly They were actually
after Hindus but I thought you’d do What do you say

ABDUL
Are you sure there isn’t a horse

INT QUEEN’S BEDROOM ENGLAND

Another dark room The curtains are thrown light streams into the
room We see Mrs Tuck at the window In the shadows is a large bed
into which a enormous mound appears to be upholstered

MRS TUCK
Good morning Your Majesty

We cut to

EXT ENTRANCE TO DOCKS

Abdul is now with Tyler a portly Englishman Bigge and what looks
like his short squat Indian manservant

TYLER
This is Mr Bigge — extra Groom in Waiting to the Royal
Household who will be in charge This is Abdul

BIGGE
This is Mohammed

TYLER
He’s very short

BIGGE
We had to swop him at the last minute The tall guy had an
accident with an elephant

Abdul beams at Mohammed who is distinctly unhappy

ABDUL
Hi

Mohammed looks sourly and does not respond

INT QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER

A group of straining footmen roll Queen Victoria over and then
manhandle her out of bed

EXT ON DECK AT SEA DAY

Abdul and Mohammed standing in front of Bigge who has a chart on
a tripod

BIGGE
At the top there’s the Private Secretary then there are the
Ladies in Waiting the Upper Servants the lower Upper
Servants the members of the Household the Head of the
Household staff — splitting into three parts the head of the
Bedchamber the personal head of staff the Butler in
Chief who is in charge of the Household Butler the
kitchen factotum head of kitchen the head of waiting staff
the ordinary waiting staff (Windsor) the table maids then
you Any questions

ABDUL
Who will have the mohar sir

BIGGE
I’m not exactly sure as yet I suspect you will both carry it
On a cushion
ABDUL
We both have a cushion

BIGGE
No there’ll only be one cushion Between you

ABDUL
Can we have a cushion now sir

BIGGE
You’ll have to mime the cushion

ABDUL
I don’t understand sir

BIGGE
Pretend You’ll have to pretend the cushion is there Like
this The key to good service is standing still and moving
backward The most important thing is you must not look
at her

ABDUL
But how will we present the mohar sir

BIGGE
‘You put out the cushion and avert your gaze appropriately
Her Majesty will take the mohar and you will egress
retrospectively in a stately manner

MOHAMMED
What an arsehole

INT OUTSIDE THE QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER

A line of dressers ladies-in-waiting footmen equerries etc all parade
into the Queen’s bedchamber

INT CABIN AT SEA

Abdul and Mohammed in their tiny cell Mohammed has a pile of
buns He passes one to Abdul
MOHAMMED
Have you any idea how cold it is We’re gonna bloody
die there

ABDUL
Why on earth did you agree to come

MOHAMMED
Had no choice The tall guy fell off an elephant and I got
drafted in at the last moment Five thousand miles to
present a bloody medal

ABDUL
But it’s a very great honour

MOHAMMED
Honour My father fought in the Mutiny Have you
tasted English food They eat pig’s blood

ABDUL
They do not eat pig’s blood

MOHAMMED
I’m telling you they have pig’s blood in sausages And
the brains of sheep The place is barbaric

ABDUL
Not to worry

Abdul shows Mohammed a little tin containing a load of spices
A present from my mother

MOHAMMED
My advice eat as much as you can before we hit land

He passes Abdul another bun
Let’s give her the medal and get the hell back home

BIGGE
Splendid

TAILOR
We copied them from some drawings in the British Museum

ABDUL
A sash is not traditional sir

some innovations We need it to look authentic

INT THE HALL

A fanfare The main doors fly open The fanfare reaches its climax
Enter the Queen We see her properly for the very first time She is a
tiny almost spherical figure old frail glum and dreadfully tired
Ponsonby leads her to her seat The entourage follow the Prince of
Wales laughing coarsely with Lady Churchill Dr Reid various
dignitaries All completely casual Everyone else in the hall is frigidly
agog craning to see the little old lady at the centre She sits then utters
an audible sigh of relief Her bowl of soup is placed in front of her

She attacks it greedily making a disgusting slurping noise as she eats
everybody starts to eat

INT CORRIDOR THE SAME

Abdul and Mohammed try to have a gander but are pushed out of the
way by Alick Yorke

INT HALL THE SAME

The Queen has soup all around her mouth and 1s scraping the bowl to
get the last bit Then she is finished in record time She plonks her
spoon on the bowl and cleans her chin with the napkin Quick as a
flash a waiter removes the bowl Further down the table as guests are
amiably enjoying the conversation around them suddenly waiters
snatch the bowls — still full of soup Dr Reid addresses a startled diner

The babble of excited chatter Everyone around the Queen is
animated The Queen ignores it all and is shovelling quenelles into her
mouth Cut to her polishing off the boeuf braisé then tearing apart a
pheasant

looking Lady in Waiting is eating salad primly Back to the Queen
her plate is clean and she is nodding off

dessert

ALICK YORKE
The profiteroles have gone Gentlemen

Alick Yorke makes a final adjustment to the mohar

ALICK YORKE
Now Process Turn Bow Present And absolutely no
sodding eye contact what-so-ever

Abdul takes a huge breath looks nervously at Mohammed A trumpet
sounds and they walk up the hall Everybody turns to see the two
Indians process with the mohar The Queen is now talking to the
Viceroy and is taking no notice at all of the ceremony Abdul and
Mohammed can see her from the corner of their eye They reach the
head of the table and stop They turn Bow The Queen is still talking
and pays them no attention Ponsonby explains

PONSONBY
A gift from the Colony of India A mohar Your Majesty

The Queen turns and looks at the mohar incredulous

PONSONBY
A coin from the Mughal Empire In honour of your service
to the sub-continent

Abdul presents the tray bowing his head low The Queen takes the coin
utterly bemused Another servant puts a cushion on the table for it to
rest on Abdul doesn’t quite know what to do Ponsonby angrily indicates
for them to leave Abdul takes the hint They back away as trained

The Queen lifts her arms This time we witness the whole unedifying
affair The dresser arrives with a dress and has some trouble getting it
over her head Finally her head is prised out of the garment The Queen
makes no expression A gaggle of ladies in waiting and maidservants

outline the days activities

EXT THE SAME TABLE AT THE GARDEN PARTY

A wobbling jelly We pull up to see Abdul carefully carrying it followed
by Mohammed who has his own Queen Victoria 1s at the table
looking dour and fearsome Abdul starts to panic as the jelly starts
wobbling perilously on the plate The more he nears the Queen the
more errant the giant jelly becomes With a great deal of sweat and
consternation Abdul navigates the jelly to Her Majesty

ABDUL
Jelly Your Majesty

Abdul puts the jelly in front of the Queen her eyes light up Abdul
bows ostentatiously then drops to his knees The entire table of guests
crane round to see what he is doing Bigge and Ponsonby look on in
horror The Queen looks down curiously The whole Royal Household
seem to hold their breath Abdul suddenly lunges down — everyone
gasps Kneeling down he kisses her feet rises bows again and retreats

breaks into a smile

Abdul Abdul Karim I am always writing In India Pm

The mohar It is my humble privilege to serve Her Majesty
I was the one who chose your carpets

QUEEN VICTORIA
The carpets

ABDUL
For the exhibition The Viceroy asked Mr Tyler but actually
it was me You have to have very good eye for the carpets
This is a very nice one For example

They look at the carpet beneath them

ABDUL
Very tight knots This is the sign of a very nice carpet The
art of carpets came to India with the great Emperor Akbar
The skill of a great carpet is to bring all the different
threads together and we weave something we can stand on

QUEEN VICTORIA
You seem to know an awful lot about it

ABDUL
My family were carpet makers But now I write in the
book Life is like the carpet We weave in and out to make
a pattern

QUEEN VICTORIA
How very true That is a very beautiful image

It is a very beautiful carpet Look at this — here is a bird of
freedom caught forever in the design

Mumtaz laid inside All of that beauty for the dead Queen

QUEEN VICTORIA
The Peacock Throne

ABDUL
You are the Empress of India You must learn Urdu The
language of the Mughals Oh there are a thousand
languages in India but Urdu is the most noble The
difference is when you write it down In Urdu you write
like this

He demonstrates it

This is Persian script Just like Arabic And for Hindi you
write like this — in Devanagari

The Persian script is most superior

Brown here Yet I have been happier here than anywhere in

been thirty years and I think about him every day I am so
lonely Abdul Everyone I really loved has died And I just
go on and on and on

She weeps

ABDUL

QUEEN VICTORIA
It’s an impossible position No one really knows what it is
like to be Queen I am hated by millions of people — all
over the world I have had nine children all vain and
jealous and completely at loggerheads with each other
Bertie is a complete embarrassment I have thirty-four
grandchildren my offspring will rule most of Europe — but

the point Abdul

ABDUL
The point Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA

Of life
ABDUL
Service
QUEEN VICTORIA

here to serve a greater purpose

Queen Victoria thinks about this

ABDUL
In the Koran it says we are here for the good of others

QUEEN VICTORIA
The Koran

Abdul is trying to cheer up Her Majesty with his enthusiasm

ABDUL
Oh yes I am a Hafiz I know the Koran by heart

QUEEN VICTORIA
By heart Isn’t it very long

ABDUL
There are 114 Surahs containing 6236 verses

QUEEN VICTORIA

Iam a Muslim Your Majesty I learnt the Koran from my
father And he taught me all the great poets Kabir Rumi
He is my Munshi

QUEEN VICTORIA
Munshi

ABDUL
Yes Munshi My teacher

QUEEN VICTORIA

shall teach me Urdu and the Koran and anything else you
think of

INT HALL BALMORAL NIGHT

A dozen local guests are waiting for the dinner Mohammed is
standing with a tray of sherry Across the room Ponsonby Bertie
Miss Phipps Lady Churchill and Dr Reid are gathered in a huddle

BERTIE
What the hell is a Munshi

PONSONBY
Apparently it’s some sort of ‘spiritual teacher’ Your Royal
Highness
BERTIE

Has she completely lost her mind She’s the head of the
Church of England for God’s sake What’s the Archbishop
of Canterbury going to say

DR REID
It’s utter lunacy

LADY CHURCHILL
I say he’s ‘brown’ John Brown

DR REID
And what’s more she’s given him my room

MISS PHIPPS
But where have they put you Dr Reid

DR REID
(with a hateful look to Ponsonby)

magnificent Munshi garb

Head Waiter announces

HEAD WAITER
Dinner is served

INT THE SAME STAIRCASE
Bertie with Queen Victoria

BERTIE
Lady Churchill was absolutely scandalised A servant And
a Hindoo to boot

QUEEN VICTORIA
The Munshi is a Muslim scholar He knows the Koran off
by heart and for your information is no longer a servant
He is to be given a staff of his own

BERTIE
This is absurd Letters Invitations to supper You’re treating
him like family

QUEEN VICTORIA
No I like Abdul Lady Churchill had better get used to the
fact — as the Munshi is coming on holiday with us as a fully
equal member of the Household

BERTIE
You can’t take a Muslim to Florence

QUEEN VICTORIA
That will be all

The Queen walks off upstairs

INT RAILWAY CARRIAGE DAY

The train is trundling along Mohammed blows his nose into his
handkerchief

MOHAMMED
A spiritual advisor You haven’t an idea in your head You
promised to get us out of here And now we’re going to
bloody Florence

ABDUL
But don’t you see what a privilege it is to see the glories of
Italy with all these wonderful people

MOHAMMED
You complete bloody idiot Do you really think they are
going to stand there and let her promote a wog I did not
come here to carry your bloody cases

ABDUL
What you are complaining about We have our own
carriage With a bathroom They’ve a very nice bed for
you on the floor

Mohammed blows his nose

MOHAMMED
I’m dying here I want to go home I am telling you this
whole thing is a disaster waiting to happen

ABDUL
I am getting sick of your negative attitude Life is a big
adventure You just need to open up and enjoy it We’re on
holiday What on earth could possibly go wrong

Abdul sees a rope above him — he grabs hold of it and reads the little
sign beside it

ABDUL
‘Do Not Pull

INT QUEEN’S CARRIAGE TRAIN LATER

understandable mistake I am just so glad you are with us
What a treat to show you Florence for the first time

Bertie emerges from the royal bathroom in his pyjamas to see Abdul

BERTIE
What’s he doing here

QUEEN VICTORIA
Abdul was just explaining what happened earlier

BERTIE
I really don’t see why I have to share your bathroom

QUEEN VICTORIA
I shared a bed with my mother until I became Queen

BERTIE
Mother I am fifty-seven years old The Munshi’s got his
own bathroom

ABDUL
Oh yes it is a very fine bathroom indeed Your Majesty

BERTIE
Excuse me

He has to push his way past Abdul

BERTIE
Goodnight Ma-mah

ABDUL

Abdul’s hand

QUEEN VICTORIA

to Florence And becoming my Munshi It is a locket With
a picture of me

She gives him a locket

QUEEN VICTORIA
Isn’t it glorious Albert loved it here The Brunelleschi
Dome The Uffizi Gallery He spent all of his money on
Old Masters We collected so much I had to give most of it
to the National Gallery He so admired the Medicis That
they would commission the greatest artists of the day So
they could leave something astonishing behind

ABDUL
In India we also commision great artists Each Mughal
Emperor would bring the greatest craftsmen to make great
glories for their Durbar Room

QUEEN VICTORIA
A Durbar Room

ABDUL
Oh yes every Emperor had a Durbar Room Full of the
finest things known to man

QUEEN VICTORIA
Well Iam the Empress of India I should have a Durbar
Room

listening intently next to the Queen Bertie next to Lady Churchill
Ponsonby says something to Dr Reid The Munshi turns

ABDUL
Ssshhhh

The fat man at the piano finishes his song Abdul applauds
enthusiastically

QUEEN VICTORIA
And where did you say it was from Mr Puccini

PUCCINI
It’s from my new opera Manon Lescaut It’s about two
lovers separated by the class divide who run away together

QUEEN VICTORIA
It sounds marvellous

PUCCINI
But she is imprisoned for her love Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Oh

PUCCINI
But they escape

QUEEN VICTORIA
Bravo

PUCCINI
But finally she dies leaving him utterly bereft

QUEEN VICTORIA
I’m not sure we do like the sound of it We prefer comic
opera Do you know any Gilbert and Sullivan

ABDUL
Perhaps Your Majesty will sing us a song

QUEEN VICTORIA
Oh no I couldn’t possibly

The Household on cue

LADY CHURCHILL
But please Your Majesty

BERTIE
(aside)

‘Little Buttercup’ In C

Bertie sits at the piano with immense reluctance Queen Victoria sings

‘Little Buttercup’ poorly She dries is about to continue but Ponsonby
prompts the applause

ABDUL
Bravo More More

But to everyone’s relief Puccini produces a glass of champagne and
hands it to the Queen

PUCCINI

QUEEN VICTORIA

Puccini raises his glass

PUCCINI
To the Queen

QUEEN VICTORIA
To me

She knocks back the champagne

of the Gilbert and Sullivan song

She lifts her arm as she walks half dancing
We should not have drunk all that champagne
She giggles

ABDUL
May I

Abdul takes the Queen’s other hand and they waltz their way along
the terrace ‘la-la-ing’ an accompaniment We are close up on their

almost childish pleasure Finally the Queen and Abdul stumble and
come to a stop Abdul smiling at the Queen Still holding her

QUEEN VICTORIA
Abdul I have not been so happy for years

ABDUL
When I came to England I was terrified of you But you
are a very kind lady You are a very unique lady to me

QUEEN VICTORIA
And you are very very ‘unique’ to me Abdul

ABDUL
I know that you are very much older than me And you are
the Queen of England and Empress of India and I am just
a humble Munshi But I think you are the most special
person in my whole life

His eyes are alight They look at each other intimately

ABDUL
Even more special than my wife

QUEEN VICTORIA
(shocked)
Wife

ABDUL

The Queen is computing this information her face severe

QUEEN VICTORIA
You are married

ABDUL
Of course

QUEEN VICTORIA
But where is your wife

ABDUL

INT LADIES’ DRESSING ROOM NIGHT
Lady Churchill puts on her a yashmak and looks in the mirror

LADY CHURCHILL
I have never been so humiliated in my entire life

INT DURBAR ROOM NIGHT

The lights in the hall have dimmed Music The Queen squeezes Mrs
Karim’s hand Alick Yorke appears from between the curtains on stage

ALICK YORKE
A scene in Ancient Persia

He withdraws Ponsonby pops a pill The Queen is agog with delighted
anticipation The curtains open to reveal painted flats A scene from
Ancient Persia Lady Churchill Miss Phipps and Mrs Tuck come on
dressed in Persian costumes They pose as a harem of supplicants Enter
Abdul dressed as the Sultan of Persia with Ahmed as his servant
Mohammed is at the back sick with fever

ABDUL
I am the Sultan of Persia King of all Kings You are now
under my power

LADY CHURCHILL
Your Highness We bestow all the riches of the Orient upon
you

The ladies proffer paste jewels Abdul tries his best to look triumphantly
regal They all look out uneasily at the audience trying to maintain a
matey rictus as the orchestra swells and they hold the tableau Ahmed
is in the way — Abdul surreptitiously cuffs him to clear his sightline

We notice Mohammed swaying clearly ill and just as the curtain
descends as everyone else is fixed in the tableau Mohammed sneezes
Lord Salisbury is open-mouthed Ponsonby holds his forehead in
despair The Queen is unabashed with her approval

QUEEN VICTORIA
Bravo Bravo the Munshi

BERTIE
(aside to Dr Reid)
Now she thinks he’s Henry Irving

As the curtain opens for the ‘call’ the Queen leaps to her feet The
entire household follow suit applauding politely Only Mrs Karim and
her mother remain seated Abdul gestures his respects to Her Majesty
and bows egregiously She claps enthusiastically The curtains close
again Salisbury is not happy

INT HALLWAY OSBORNE HOUSE NIGHT
Lord Salisbury bollocks Ponsonby

LORD SALISBURY
What the hell is this Ponsonby Munshi-mania I’m trying

to keep an empire together and it looks like they’re running
the place I want this whole sodding mess knocked on the
head or yow’re finished Understood

Lord Salisbury turns and leaves leaving Ponsonby chagrined

INT POST-TABLEAU ROOM OSBORNE HOUSE NIGHT

The post-tableau soirée Victoria is sitting amongst the prominent
members of the household drinking sherry Ponsonby battle-torn
comes in to join them

QUEEN VICTORIA
Ah Ponsonby Tell us what exactly did the Prime Minister
say about the tableau

PONSONBY
To be entirely frank Your Majesty he seemed to be a little
perturbed

QUEEN VICTORIA
Whatever for He must have liked the Munshi

PONSONBY
I think the Munshi was the problem Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Really I thought he was rather good

PONSONBY
I think he meant his position Your Majesty I think he
was rather alarmed he had such a prominent role in the
Household

QUEEN VICTORIA
Of course Abdul has a prominent role in the household He
is my Munshi

PONSONBY
But he’s an Indian Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Iam aware of it

PONSONBY
But given current sensitivities in the sub-continent Your
Majesty The Prime Minister was concerned it might be
‘sending the wrong message’

QUEEN VICTORIA
I should have thought it was a jolly good message

PONSONBY
But he’s a Muslim Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Precisely We owe them so much do we not For their role
in the Mutiny for example

The hubbub drops to a deathly silence

PONSONBY
The Mutiny Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Yes For all the help they gave us with the Hindus

DR REID
But the Mutiny was a Muslim-led revolt Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Are you sure

DR REID
Of course The Muslim soldiers revolted when it was
rumoured their rifles were greased with pork fat

QUEEN VICTORIA
Really

PONSONBY
The Grand Mufti himself put out a fatwa against you
personally And Muslim soldiers killed over two thousand
British personnel

BERTIE
Who have you been talking to Mother

Suddenly Abdul arrives with a flourish in his smartest Munshi garb

ABDUL
Ta-da

The Queen glares at him Everyone else is staring He realises
something is wrong

INT SCULPTURE CORRIDOR OSBORNE HOUSE NIGHT

The Queen is standing next to Abdul in the corridor giving him a
furious dressing down

QUEEN VICTORIA
I have opened my heart to you I have brought your family
from India promoted you in the teeth of very considerable
opposition and disquiet from the Household I even turned
a blind eye when you failed to tell me you were married
which came as you know as quite a surprise How could
you let me humiliate myself in front of the entire Household

ABDUL
I am deeply sorry Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
You said the Hindus were behind the Mutiny

ABDUL
I didn’t say it was only the Hindus Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
You told me categorically that the Muslims were my
friends

ABDUL
But we are your friends Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Abdul there is a fatwa against me It was Muslims who
started the whole thing This is completely unacceptable
Abdul I thought you were outstanding as the Sultan of
Persia but I’m afraid you will have to go home

INT FURTHER ALONG THE CORRIDOR NIGHT

you see what a position I have been put in Thank you for
everything you’ve done for me

She starts to leave She turns and faces Abdul We can see Mohammed
looking on behind her

I will miss you a very great deal
She turns and walks down the corridor

Queen Victoria marches along the corridor passing Bertie Dr Reid
and Lady Churchill who dutifully follow her smirking like cats that
have got the cream

Abdul is standing devastated We see Mohammed has been watching

MOHAMMED
So we’re going home

He starts to cough

INT SCULPTURE CORRIDOR NIGHT

try to keep straight faces

Pouring rain It is Mrs Tuck under an umbrella Abdul is amazed

EXT LANE OUTSIDE NIGHT

Victoria is in her pony and trap Abdul is standing by the trap under
an umbrella held by Mrs Tuck

QUEEN VICTORIA
Abdul you have been an utter fool and I am absolutely
furious with you It is unconscionable that as my Munshi
you should have lied to me in any way But also it would be
completely churlish not to recognise the considerable
kindness and devotion you’ve shown And after all I am
sure you thought in some way you were protecting me But
as the monarch I do realise nothing can really protect me
And in that light I have decided even though I am very
disappointed I would like you to stay

Abdul is astonished

QUEEN VICTORIA
But it must never happen again

ABDUL
Oh Your Gracious Majesty How can I ever thank you

QUEEN VICTORIA
Well there is something we really must sort out Abdul

Abdul has no idea what she could mean

I am deeply concerned about Mrs Karim

INT QUEEN’S BEDROOM OSBORNE HOUSE DAY

The Queen is having breakfast in bed attended by Dr Reid Ponsonby
and Mrs Tuck

QUEEN VICTORIA
I want you to examine Mrs Karim

DR REID
Examine Mrs Karim

QUEEN VICTORIA
Just make sure everything’s working

PONSONBY
But I thought the Munshi and his family were leaving us
Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Whatever gave you that impression

Astonishment from all and sundry

The Munshi and his family are an integral part of the Royal
Household And I would be very grateful if you gave her a
thorough examination

She blithely goes back to work on her egg Dr Reid looks at Ponsonby

INT OSBORNE HOUSE TOP OF STAIRS DAY

Bertie Ponsonby and Reid descending the stairs

BERTIE
As far as I’m concerned this is war We’re going to dig up
every last piece of shit the blaggard’s ever done I want
someone in India raking through the family coals Isn’t
your son out there Ponsonby

PONSONBY
I couldn’t possibly be involved in subterfuge Your Majesty

BERTIE
Look I’m going to be the one in charge very soon You’ll
do as you’re bloody well told I want no stone unturned
We are going to make a dossier Have it all down in black
and white and put an end to this for good

Bertie leaves Ponsonby looks at Dr Reid

DR REID
Well I better go and examine Mrs Munshi

INT COTTAGE DAY

Dr Reid is sitting awkwardly on a chair a stethoscope round his neck
clearly very unhappy The Munshi’s wife is in full burga with a veil
sitting on the side of the bed Her mother also in full burqa sits beside
her holding her hand Dr Reid looks at Mrs Karim awkwardly then
turns to Abdul who is waiting anxiously by the doctor’s side

REID
I need to see her tongue

ABDUL
Oh it is not possible to uncover a lady’s mouth Doctor

REID
But how can I tell anything if I can’t see her tongue

Abdul speaks to the mother-in-law in Hindi the mother-in-law speaks
to Mrs Karim Then she daintily lifts her yashmak a fraction and
sticks out her tongue The doctor looks at it gingerly then it disappears
back behind the veil as quickly as it appeared

ABDUL
Well

REID
I think she’s fine

INT OUTSIDE MOHAMMED’S ROOM DAY

Ponsonby and Bertie are in the servants’ corridor Ponsonby knocks
on a door

INT MOHAMMED’S ROOM DAY

Bertie and Ponsonby are in Mohammed’s room Mohammed has
declined since we last saw him

PONSONBY
Mr Mohammed We have come here because we are not
unaware of your predicament That you arrived in the first
place almost by accident and find yourself stuck here
through a bizarre set of circumstances — none of your own
making It is not beneath our notice that the inclement
English weather especially on the Solent has been the
cause of a precipitous decline in your general health and
what’s more you continue to suffer the vast indignity of
being a servant to someone who is in many ways your
inferior who seems to discharge his role with increasing
abuse and disregard But it has occurred to us that we
might be able to offer you some help

MOHAMMED
Help

PONSONBY
Travel home medical care perhaps a modest pension
In return of course for a little information

MOHAMMED
What sort of information

PONSONBY
Look I’m not going to beat about the bush You’ve borne
the brunt of Abdul’s appalling behaviour and that is of a
great deal of interest to a lot of people

MOHAMMED
‘You want me to dish the dirty

PONSONBY
In a manner of speaking

Mohammed coughs into his handkerchief

MOHAMMED
What would you like me to say

BERTIE
Anything really

PONSONBY
We need details What he says what he does

Mohammed thinks about this

MOHAMMED
Abdul does what everybody else does Looks for preferment
‘Curries’ favour Crawls up the stinking greasy pole of the
shitty British Empire Making fools of you all because he is
a servant — an Indian Muslim servant — and you are all
quaking in your boots because he’s beating you at your own
game

BERTIE
No one is quaking in their boots We are the most powerful
nation on Earth at the height of our influence

MOHAMMED
In that case the only way is down So stick your stupid
British Empire up your stinky royal bottom-hole Mr Bertie
Prince sir I hope he makes the whole damn thing come
tumbling down

He coughs into his handkerchief There is blood Mohammed is
shocked Ponsonby looks on in pity

BERTIE
T’ll see that you die here

round to see her with Lady Churchill Miss Phipps et al

QUEEN VICTORIA
I am not a fool I know there is some skulduggery afoot
Something is going on here and I am not going to stand
for it

Ponsonby et al look terrified

QUEEN VICTORIA
Dr Reid I asked you to get to the bottom of Mrs Karim’s
fertility issues and it seems nothing has been done

DR REID
Well actually Your Majesty it was impossible to make a
conclusive judgement for religious reasons

QUEEN VICTORIA
Well did you examine the Munshi

DR REID
No Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Well examine the Munshi

the Munshi

INT BERTIE’S BEDROOM OSBORNE HOUSE DAY

Bertie is now in bed with a post-coital cigar Lady Churchill is also in
the bed Ponsonby and Dr Reid have just explained the news

BERTIE
The clap

LADY CHURCHILL
But we can’t possibly tell her It would kill her stone dead

BERTIE
Maybe it’s not such a bad idea

PONSONBY
There’s more It appears the father far from being an
Indian Eminent is in fact a prison apothecary

BERTIE
Are you sure

PONSONBY
I received a telegram only this afternoon from Agra My
son visited the gaol himself They are absolute nobodies

Bertie takes a puff while he thinks about this

BERTIE
Well it sounds pretty conclusive to me

INT QUEEN’S STUDY OSBORNE HOUSE DAY

Bertie knocks on the door and goes in

BERTIE
Mother we have to see you

The Queen is sitting behind a small desk Abdul intimately by her
side Ponsonby and Dr Reid stand nervously before her

BERTIE
(looking at Abdul)
Alone

QUEEN VICTORIA
I am in the middle of my Urdu lesson

BERTIE
Mother we come with very important news of a highly
personal matter

QUEEN VICTORIA
I have nothing to hide from Abdul

PONSONBY
I am afraid Your Majesty We have news concerning the
Munshi Proof beyond any doubt that Abdul Karim is a
low-born imposter Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
But the Munshi is from a noble family and a long line of
teachers

PONSONBY
The Munshi was a mere clerk in a common gaol

She is silent

My own son has sent word from India and has actually
spoken to the man in question

DR REID
His family are completely uneducated His father is a lowly
apothecary

BERTIE

The Munshi didn’t even go to school Mother The man’s a
complete fraud There he is overseeing the boxes I’m next
in line and I can’t get anywhere near them

PONSONBY
It is true Your Majesty You have been hideously duped and
ignominously misused Your Majesty The Munshi is a
blackguard and an arch deceiver I am afraid Abdul and his
father are completely common

The Queen looks horrified at the proceedings
We have prepared a dossier

Ponsonby flourishes the dossier and slams it on the Queen’s table She
seems flabbergasted She looks at the dossier The case seems conclusive
They stare at her with bated breath

QUEEN VICTORIA
You despicable toads Racialists Spying Dossiers
Picking on a poor defenceless Indian Of course they don’t
have qualifications It’s completely different out there

BERTIE
But don’t you see Mother he’s using his position for his
own gain

QUEEN VICTORIA
And how does that make him any different to any one of
you How dare you look down on Abdul How dare you
defame his poor father Bertie I am ashamed that you are
part of this Abdul is a loyal wise sympathetic human
being who has risen on his own merits Not by endless
backstabbing or family connections I will not have this
Now Repeat after me I will be courteous to the Munshi

She stares at Ponsonby He looks at Abdul then reluctantly

PONSONBY
I will be courteous to the Munshi

QUEEN VICTORIA
You

DR REID
I will be courteous to the Munshi

QUEEN VICTORIA
Bertie All of you ‘I will be courteous to the Munshi’

EVERYONE
I will be courteous to the Munshi

QUEEN VICTORIA
It has become apparent that to get any respect in the
Household one needs to be formally recognised In which
case Abdul I intend to give you a knighthood in the next
honours list

Ponsonby almost collapses

DR REID
Enough This is absurd We can’t protect you from this any
further

The Queen stares in astonishment
The man is riddled with gonorrhoea
Stunned silence

Gonorrhoea

MISS PHIPPS
And a Muslim

ALICK YORKE
She can’t just do what she likes

DR REID
That’s right We are the ones who make this palace work
and we are being ignored and exploited We have to stand
up to this wanton bullying

BIGGE
Exactly This is a usurpation of the basic tenets of
leadership

ALICK YORKE
There are moral standards at stake What is this The Year
of the Munshi

They all laugh

LADY CHURCHILL
I propose we should rise up as a household and demand
that she retracts

MISS PHIPPS
But she’s the Queen

LADY CHURCHILL
She is our sovereign Her position is entirely based on the
implicit contract she makes with us Who manages the
estates Who is up at the crack of dawn preparing her
breakfast Toadying to foreign diplomats Eating those
interminable meals Listening to the infernal drivel Lords
and Ladies the time has come to say no We must stand
together and show her who really runs this ship

PONSONBY
But this is a palace coup

LADY CHURCHILL
It is an assertion of our inalienable rights as the aristocracy
of this country The monarchy is not there by divine right

PONSONBY
I think it is actually

LADY CHURCHILL
Oh shut up

BIGGE
I agree We must resist these foreign intruders for the sake
of England the Empire and St George

LADY CHURCHILL
I say either she drops this preposterous insult or we will
all leave

I have come to ask you to reconsider the elevation of
of Mr Karim

The Queen can’t quite believe her ears

QUEEN VICTORIA
What did you say

MISS PHIPPS
I have come to ask you not to give Mr Karim a knighthood
Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Why the devil not

MISS PHIPPS
The members of the Household demand that you abandon
your plans Your Majesty

QUEEN VICTORIA
Demand

MISS PHIPPS
We believe that it degrades the very concept of knighthood
He comes from a very low family Your Majesty And he is
coloured

QUEEN VICTORIA
Get out of my sight

Miss Phipps looks like she’s beginning to crack

QUEEN VICTORIA
Did you not hear me

MISS PHIPPS

countenance such an insult

forty-two grandchildren and almost a billion citizens I
have rheumatism a collapsed uterus am morbidly obese
deaf in one ear I have known eleven prime ministers
passed 2347 pieces of legislation I have been in office for
sixty-two years 234 days — thus I am the longest-serving
monarch in world history I am responsible for five
households and a staff of more than three thousand I am
cantankerous boring greedy ill-tempered at times selfish
and myopic metaphorically and literally I am perhaps
disagreeably attached to power and should not have
smashed the Emperor of Russia’s egg But I am anything
but insane If the Household wish to disobey me so be it —
let them do it face to face I will see everyone in the Durbar
Room At once

I understand there is some concern over my desires on
preferment I understand that feelings have run high and
I understand that you have decided to resign rather than
withstand my decision If any one of you would like to
tender their resignation it will be accepted without any
unfortunate consequences — but at least have the decency
to do it to my face If anyone wishes to resign please step
forward

She stares at them absolutely formidable Nervousness People looking
at one another Small feints but no one moves Abdul is watching from
the doorway

QUEEN VICTORIA
I would like to inform you that I have decided against
awarding any knighthoods at this moment

Relief all round that she’s come to her senses

Instead you will be delighted to know I have decided to
make the Munshi a Commander of the Royal Victorian
Order as a special token of my personal esteem for his
services to the Empire That will be all

Abdul in the eye with contempt

hand and leads him into the room

INT QUEEN’S BEDCHAMBER

The Queen has been transformed into a transcendental vision We see
Abdul transfixed by the dead Queen Slowly with great reverence he
kneels before her

ABDUL
May Allah bless you

He kisses her feet Finally as he raises his head we see his devastated
sadness Then his look turns from one of devastated loss to one of
foreboding

INT CORRIDOR OSBORNE HOUSE

Abdul walks out along the corridor and down the grand staircase On
the sound track we hear the sound of violent banging on a door

VOICE
(out of shot)
Open up in the name of the King

pushing her aside as they rush into the house

Karim and her mother in full burga try to prevent them taking things
A henchman goes past with a drawer stuffed with letters

EXT GARDEN ABDUL’S COTTAGE DAY

The henchmen have made a big pyre of the letters One henchman
pours petrol on and the whole thing goes up in flames Bertie looks on
contentedly smoking a cigar Mrs Karim runs out

scream and he starts to run

EXT GARDEN ABDUL’S COTTAGE DAY

being restrained by a henchman Suddenly there is a shout Abdul
comes running into the garden

ABDUL
No

Footmen hold back the screaming Abdul as the pyre burns

BERTIE
I want you out of here immediately

Satisfied he leaves Mrs Karim takes Abdul’s hand

MRS KARIM
They’ve taken everything

She surreptitiously gives him something as the pyre burns He looks
down She has given him the locket He holds it tight The smoke of the
fire obscures everything

INT PASSENGER FERRY SOLENT MISTY MORNING

The smoke turns into mist on the Solent We are on a ferry Abdul and
his wife as it pulls away from shore No one recognises Abdul He opens
his palm to reveal the Queen’s locket Looking back he disappears into
the mist as the boat sails away

INT DARKENED ROOM AGRA MORNING

As in the beginning of the film shutters are opened on to bright
daylight as a muezzin calls to prayers

EXT ROOFTOP AGRA

As before we see a figure from behind praying The rooftops of Agra
below the Taj Mahal in the distance

Title

ABDUL RETURNED TO AGRA IN IQOI

EXT STREETS AGRA BRIGHT DAY

The bustle of an Agra street A figure makes his way through the chaotic
street life as in the opening of the film But this time the figure is slow
We follow him from behind and see he has grey hair We realise this is
Abdul He makes his way determinedly through the city to a park

EXT AGRA PARK

Abdul makes his way to a statue of Queen Victoria He kneels We
think he is praying but he kisses the Queen’s feet

ABDUL
Good morning Your Majesty

Abdul sits on the base of the statue He looks out at the crowds passing
by In his hand we see the locket — the camera slowly cranes back

Abdul the faithful retainer has kept his word he remains loyally with
his Queen despite everything

Title
HE DIED NINE YEARS LATER

We crane above the statue to see the whole vista of Agra The Taj
Mahal glistening in the background
