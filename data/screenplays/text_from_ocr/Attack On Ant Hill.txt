ATTACK ON ANT HILL

© 2016
EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT

We open on a backyard a rusty swing set is seen in the
corner Bushes and trees are void of color The grass has
brown blotches randomly In the house lights are on A porch
light illuminates the backyard

Laying on the blotchy grass is a young kid no more than
eight He’s using a stick to continuously poke at an Ant
hill Here and there the kid uses the stick to wrack whole
parts of the Ant hill off

As Ants try escape their now destroyed home the little kid
precedes to kill each and every Ant that dares to escape his
wrath

The way the porch light mixes with the moonlight makes the
little kid seem horrifically evil

WOMAN (0S)

Time to come inside sweetie It’s

bedtime
The kid picks up an Ant and stares blankly at it The Ant
squirms trying to get free Smiling menacingly the kid
squeezes the life out of the helpless Ant Wiping the blood
off on the blotchy grass the kid gets up

KID
Coming Mommy

The kid runs to his mom and goes inside

The destroyed Ant hill looks like the remains of a battle
field

FRAME ZOOMS IN

EXT ANT HILL - CONTINUOUS

The Ant hill is now much larger Looks like a building that
has half of it’s structure torn off

Ants are running back and forth Some are carrying half dead
Ants back to the remains of the Ant hill Ants screaming is
heard ringing into the night sky

Two worker Ants walk by and grab a dying Ant and drag the
body back to the Ant hill

The song “MAD WORLD” is heard coming from the house

The two Ants pass by ANDREW ANT a tiny nervous looking Ant
ANDREW
Every night for weeks the monster
has been attacking I think I know
how to stop it

The two Ants ignore him as they go inside the Ant hill

In the distance Andrew sees water in a clear plastic cup the
cup is huge to the Ants In the cup is hundreds of drowned
Ants

Some Ants are climbing to the top of the cup only to find it
blocked off by the lid The Ants wander around the bottom of
the lid trying to find a way out Most don’t and these Ants
fall to the water and the hundreds of dead Ants below

Andrew closes his eyes and shakes his head turning around he
goes inside the Ant hill

The light turns off and shortly after so does the music The
only sound now is the screaming of the Ants

The stars are shining the moon big and bright It all makes
this destroyed Ant hill and the surrounding area look like
a scene from a World War Two movie

INT ANT HILL PASSAGEWAY - COUPLE MOMENTS LATER

Andrew is walking down a passageway The passageway is filled
with injured dying and dead Ants

Andrew squeezes into a side room where voices are heard

INT SIDE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
In the room is a group of Ants all looking at one big Ant at
the front The big Ant is MAJOR ANT Standing by Major Ant is
STEVEN ANT Steven Ant is huge even bigger than Major Ant
Steven sees Andrew he waves Andrew waves back
Major Ant is shaking his head thoughtfully
MAJOR ANT
We can’t do full on war with the
Monster by ourselves

Only murmurs are heard No one knows what to say

Looking around the room Andrew nervously raises one of his
arms
ANDREW
I know what we can do

Every Ant turns their attention to Andrew
Andrew swallows hard He clears his throat

ANDREW (CONTD)
Grasshoppers

MAJOR ANT
Grasshoppers

ANDREW
Grasshoppers want food They’re
always short We have food We
always have plenty Send a couple
of us to parlay with the
Grasshoppers

MAJOR ANT
And say what to them

ANDREW
If they help defeat the Monster
they get half our food

All at once all the Ants start talking really loud

Major and Steven are looking at Andrew Steven is smiling
while Major has no emotion on his face Andrew is shuffling
his six feet awkwardly

While still staring at Andrew Major raises his arms to
quite everyone

The other Ants slowly one by one stop talking When there’s
silence in the room Major lowers his arms

MAJOR ANT
You think Grasshoppers can defeat
the monster

Andrew shakes his head

ANDREW
No I think together we can defeat
the Monster

Andrew licks his lips nervously

ANDREW (CONTD)
Even when it’s laying down we
can’t get to all of it

(MORE)
ANDREW (CONT’D)

A couple bites but nothing major
We need an air attack combined with
a ground attack

Andrew glances around the room all eyes are on him Andrew
makes eye contact with Steven Steven gives him a thumbs up

ANDREW (CONTD)

When the Monster lays down that’s
when he’s most vulnerable We wait
till

MAJOR ANT
It’s killing us

Andrew sadly nods his head

ANDREW
Yes But the Monster laying down is
the only way to defeat it We have
to make it think that it’s
invincible That’s when it’1l be at
it’s weakest

Andrew wipes sweat from his brow

ANDREW (CONTD)

We attack the bottom of the head
while the Grasshoppers attack the
top Together as one one organized
attack we can defeat the Monster

Every Ants eyes turn to Major Major nods and points to
Steven

MAJOR ANT
Ok You leave at first light
Steven go with him

Andrew jerks in surprise

ANDREW
What No not

Steven cuts Andrew off

STEVEN
Yes sir

Steven walks up to Andrew towering over him Steven is at
least three Ants taller than Andrew

ANDREW
What just happened
STEVEN
Andrew buddy you and I are going
to save our home

Andrew gulps

ANDREW
I’m not a soldier

Steven shrugs
STEVEN
Tomorrow you will be Just do as I
say when I say it and you’1ll be
fine I’1l keep you safe

Andrew looks terrified Steven smiles and hugs Andrew

STEVEN (CONT’D)
Come on let’s get some rest

Steven walks out the room followed by a confused and scared
Andrew

EXT ANT HILL - MORNING

The Sun is rising in the East casting a Orangeish glow across
the yard The Orange glow makes the many dead bodies of Ants
shimmer giving it a spooky feel

Andrew and Steven slowly walk down the Ant hill towards the

rusty swing set in the distance They cross over a small
ridge and out of sight

EXT GRASS - HOURS LATER

Steven and Andrew are walking thru the blotchy grass The Sun
is higher in the sky shining down making them sweat

ANDREW
How much longer

STEVEN
Be quite This is the wild We
don’t want to be noticed

Andrew glances around him

ANDREW
I don’t see anything noticing us
STEVEN
Be quite They’re out there Bees
Termites Birds You ever seen a
bird up close

Andrew shakes his head

STEVEN (CONT’D)
I’ve seen a bird the size of an Ant
hill fly down and gulp up hundreds
of Ants Right in front of me So
when I say be quite Be quite

Andrew frighten beyond belief nods his head silently

They walk in silence for a couple moments Andrew nervously
looks around him

EXT GRASS - HOURS LATER

The Sun is even higher in the sky now Steven and Andrew are
walking silently across the grass Not far in the distance
they see the rusty swing set

STEVEN
That’s the Grasshoppers territory
Let’s hope they don
A Bird is heard squawking in the distance making Steven stop
suddenly Andrew walking with his head down runs into the
back of Steven bouncing off of him

ANDREW
Ow

STEVEN
Did you hear that

ANDREW
Hear what

A Bird is heard squawking this time very close

STEVEN
That

Andrew with all of his senses heighten nods his head over
and over

ANDREW
Yep I certainly heard that

A shadow passes over them
STEVEN
Run

Steven and Andrew start sprinting towards the rusty swing
set They’re running as fast as they can but the shadow of
the Bird keeps getting closer

They can see the shadow of the claws descending towards them
Andrew is starting to lag behind Steven

STEVEN (CONTD)
Andrew Faster Faster

The rusty swing set is seen over a small hill they’re close
A swarm of Grasshoppers rises from the grass

Steven dives under the swarm He looks back and sees Andrew a
couple paces away

STEVEN (CONTD)
Come on You can do it

The Bird dive bombs at Andrew

Andrew jumps to a waiting Steven Steven catches Andrew and
they duck behind the now rushing Grasshoppers

Hundreds of Grasshoppers charge the Bird Squawking the Bird
halts it’s dissent turns around and flies to the house as
fast as it can

The Bird smacks right into a window dieing from the impact

The Grasshoppers return to the rusty swing set

EXT RUSTY SWING SET - MINUTES LATER

With the rusty swing set rising above them a group of
Grasshoppers are shoving Steven and Andrew into a big empty
ice cream jar Steven and Andrew have their hands in the air
as they walk into the jar

INT ICE CREAM JAR - CONTINUOUS

Steven and Andrew are lead to two seats They are forced to
sit down In front of the seats is an old stiff piece of gum
Seated on tin foil behind the gum is OG GRASSHOPPER A
gangster looking Grasshopper

OG
You know who I am
Andrew and Steven nod

OG (CONT’D)
Good so you know not to mess with
me Grasshoppers and Ants we have
an agreement You don’t mess with
us we don’t mess with you So
please tell me why you’re messing
with me

STEVEN
We’re not messing with you I swear
it We come on a parley

Steven nudges Andrew Andrew shakes his head

STEVEN (CONTD)
Andrew here has a proposition for
you

Andrew glares at Steven
OG nods for Andrew to start talking

OG
Go on Andrew

Andrew gulps

ANDREW
We need your help Grasshoppers
think they don’t need anyone So do
Ants Something has come and by
ourselves we can not defeat it For
your help we offer you something
that you do not have

OG smiles

OG
Oh yea what’s that

ANDREW
Food Lot’s of it And if you help
us We’ll give you half of what we
have

OGs eyes light up

OG
Half

Andrew nods
OG (CONT’D)
What do you want

Andrew gulps nervously

ANDREW
Help with defeating the Monster

OG laughs and stares at Andrew

OG
Do you know what OG means

Andrew and Steven shake their heads
OG (CONT’D)
It means Original Grasshopper And
for half your food not only will
this OG help defeat the monster
this OG will kill it for you

Andrew and Steven smile at each other

EXT ANT HILL - HOURS LATER

The Sun is starting to set Night is coming

Major Ant is standing on the top of the Ant hill looking out
in the distance Trying to see any sign of Andrew and Steven

Major takes a nervous glance at the back door to the house

MAJOR ANT
Where are you guys

As if on cue the sound of Grasshoppers wings is heard coming
over the small ridge

After a couple seconds Andrew and Steven is seen heading over
the ridge with OG and hundreds of Grasshoppers behind them
Major smiles and runs down the Ant hill to meet them

EXT RIDGE - HOUR LATER

The Sun is now set and the Moon is out in full force It’s a
full Moon The Monster(the kid)is stomping around in a circle

around the Ant hill

Andrew Steven Major and OG are standing in front hundreds
of Grasshoppers

Andrew has his arms out signaling the Grasshoppers to hold

The Monster moves a little closer to the Ant hill

ANDREW
Hold

A light turns on in the house Music is heard It’s “SLITHER”
from Velvet Revolver

The Monster moves right next to the Ant hill

ANDREW (CONT’D)
Now

Andrew Steven and Major rush towards The Monster The
Grasshoppers rise into the air and rush straight for the head
of The Monster

The Monster sees hundreds of Grasshoppers flying towards him
Right then hundreds of Ants rush out of the Ant hill at him
The Monster is overwhelmed

The Grasshoppers start attacking the top of the head
voraciously While the Ants attack the bottom

The Monster screams Lights turn on all over the house the
Monster no longer seems like a Monster but now seems like a
kid

The music is turned off in the house The Kid runs towards
the house crying

The Ants and Grasshoppers are high fiving each other
Smiling Hugging They did it They defeated the Monster

Andrew and Steven hug each other

STEVEN
You did it

ANDREW
We did it

Major smiles at them OG gives them a thumbs up

They all hear a noise coming from the backdoor A human man
comes running out He grabs the hose and rushes to the Ant
hill

OG frantically starts flying up

Andrew turns to Steven as they both get whisked away by the
on coming avalanche of water

FADE TO BLACK
