FADE IN
CLOSE ON A WOMANHH FACE BEAUTIFUL AND STRONG SHEH CRYING

INT KAT BEDROOM - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

The woman is KAT ELLIS 30 Tears stream down her face as
she sits cross-legged amid the detritus of a packing frenzy

There is an unfortunate green bridesmaid dress hanging on
the back of the door

Kati pain is palpable She buries her head in her lap
Suddenly the doorbell RINGS
Kat sits bolt upright wide eyed She looks around in
disbelief How did this happen What is she doing on the
floor
KAT
(sweetly)

Hold on

INT HALLWAY

A BIKE MESSENGER stands outside Kati door He busts a
covert ipod dance while he waits

KAT (0OS)
Coming

INT KATH FOYER

Kat wipes her face and inhales summoning deep calm
INT HALLWAY

The Bike Messenger looks up as the door swings open

Kat is a changed woman Nothing like the girl we saw on the
floor Youl never know she had been crying Or that she
even knows how

KAT

Tl so sorry I wasnf quite ready
for you

Kat props the door open with her foot as she slides a plane
ticket into an envelope She scribbles a name on the
envelope seals it and hands it to him

BIKE MESSENGER
Lady you said this was a rush I

can£ rush anything anywhere if you
donf give it to me

Kat looks down at the envelope shef still holding on to it

KAT
It a plane ticket

BIKE MESSENGER

So it is

BIKE MESSENGER
I hear that noise

Kat wills herself to surrender the envelope

BIKE MESSENGER (CONT )
You need to let go

KAT

Yeah
(beat)

Youitle going to have to help me
The Bike Messenger gently tugs the envelope out of her hand

Kat smiles

KAT (CONT)
Thank you

The Bike Messenger looks at her with genuine concern

INT KATH APARTMENT
Racing against time Kat throws open a linen closet to reveal
three neat rows of plastic bins all perfectly labeled Kat
reaches into the bin marked TRAVEL and pulls out a prepacked
toiletry kit

Kat pulls a box marked §ONDON® out from underneath her bed
She opens it

Pushing aside an old private school uniform and some letters

she pulls out a worn London A-Z a Ziploc marked SDAPTERS
and her passport

Shefi about to close the box when she sees an old photo In
it a GORGEOUS GUY kisses Kat on the cheek Hefl holding the
camera himself -- it blurred and goofy but full of love

Kat jams it back in the box and shoves it under the bed
EXT NEW YORK STREET

The Bike Messenger darts in and out of traffic avoiding the
throngs of NEW YORKERS enjoying this crisp fall day

INT KATH APARTMENT
Kat races through her apartment packing cleaning getting

ready Her place is small yet put together It Crate and
Barrel meets Martha But in a good way

INT KATH BATHROOM

Kat finally still stares into the mirror as she brushes her
teeth Therefi a strange intensity to it like shew
scrubbing away the last of her distress

EXT BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

The Bike Messenger passes a waiting Town Car as he pulls up
to a stoop He hefts his bike runs up the stairs and slips
the envelope into the door of

INT BROWNSTONE APARTMENT

A tasteful flat Stylish yet masculine A MAN stoops to
pick up the envelope We donf see his face just his
ordered minimalist apartment as he zips his carry-on and
walks out the door

EXT NEW YORK STREET

His face obscured the man steps into the purring Town Car

EXT KATH APARTMENT BUILDING
A TAXI DRIVER slams his trunk as Kat gets in Kati
apprehensive face peers out the window as they pull away

INT JFK AIRPORT
A ridiculously long line snakes towards the X-Ray machines
Latte in hand Kat cuts right through the middle

Irate PASSENGERS scowl at her Kat does this every day She

should be used to the looks by now Shefi not She
pointedly flashes the crowd her AIRPORT EMPLOYEE BADGE as she
sails through security

INT CUSTOMER SERVICE - JFK AIRPORT

Kat enters the Virgin Atlantic customer service hub It as
cramped as it is busy A FEMALE EMPLOYEE approaches with a
question Kat puts up her hand

KAT
I off duty I do not exist
Don— even look at me

The lady backs off As Kat hurries away a HARRIED EMPLOYEE
matches her step and launches in

HARRIED EMPLOYEE
IMe got a tour group from Taipei
trapped in customs a dead poodle
in Cargo parked at T9 and a lost
grandmother staggering around
International asking for her mommy
Oh and therefi a guy on two who
was stuck with his in-laws for a
week because we couldn€ get him
out of Dulles The in-laws arent
speaking to him anymore and for
some reason he pissed

Kati trying not to get sucked in

KAT
I would love to help you
Sincerely But my sisterfM getting

The Harried Employee looks like heandi going to lose it Kat
struggles then caves

KAT (CONT)

If Grandma just got off a trans-con
shel gotta go sometime

Kat starts to walk away

HARRIED EMPLOYEE
What about line two

Kat spins around and glares at him
INT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
On the phone Kat is in the middle of saying way too much

KAT

(into phone)
I completely understand sir You
just want your in-laws to see you
the way you see yourself Or at
least the way you would see
yourself if you didnf feel so
victimized by them

At that moment a CLIPBOARD manager walks by He overhears
Kat diatribe and is incredulous

CLIPBOARD
Hello Calls may be monitored for
quality control

KAT
Huh

CLIPBOARD
Over-share

Kat waves him off Then by rote

KAT

(into phone)
Mr Rajagopal we regret that you
were snowed in at Dulles but
snowstorms fall under a category
called force majeure Along with
earthquakes hurricanes and floods
In short weitle not liable

Kat checks to make sure the Clipboard has moved on Then
she continues softly but very quickly

KAT (CONT)
(into phone)
But just this once Il going to
refund the full price of your
ticket and credit you 10000
frequent flyer miles Thank you
for calling Virgin Atlantic

INT CABIN - PLANE
Kat sits in first class absently scanning the safety card
A PRETTY WOMAN across the aisle notices and smiles

PRETTY WOMAN
Your first trip

Kat realizes shefi been reading the safety card She laughs
and puts it back in the seat pocket As she often does Kat
feels compelled to explain

KAT

Hardly My family moved to England
when I was fourteen My stepdadii
a professor at University College
London

(beat)
Il going back for my sister
weddingand the best man my ex
In case I chicken out I want to
know where all the exits are

Kat eyes the front door nervously

PRETTY WOMAN
I don€ believe in marriage I
believe in hot sex Of course
that draws men to me like flies to
shit

Kat doesn€ know what to say but then a HOT GUY walks up the
aisle Kat looks at the empty seat next to her and smiles at
him He returns the smile but sits next to the Pretty Woman

HOT GUY
Hello my sweet darling

He gives the Pretty Woman a tadly in love® kiss The Pretty
Woman rolls her eyes to Kat -- what did I tell you

INT GALLEY - PLANE

Kat is hiding out She tries to calm her nerves as a MALE
FLIGHT ATTENDANT pours her a cup of water

KAT

Tl not a knuckler I fly all the
time In fact I transferred from
Heathrow two years ago and now I
run Bags and Nags here at Kennedy
so things are going really well for
me The reason I canand feel my

legs is that any minute my date is
going to walk in that door And I
need him to look really really
good today

MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
(not listening)
I wish I couldnand feel my legs

Kat peeks around the corner and spots the back of the
mysterious MAN from the opening as he loads the overhead bin
above Kati seat Kat gasps ducking back

KAT
Oh no Hef here

The Male Flight Attendant looks out at the Man who leans
against Kat seat as he chats with a FEMALE FLIGHT
ATTENDANT Kat in a panic

KAT (CONT)
What do you think Does he look
hot and is it the kinda hot
thatHl translate overseas

MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT
I resent your stereotyping of a man
in my profession but

He checks out the guy again

MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONTE )
darling hel be hot on Mars
iH like to unwrap him like a
Harrodfi gift basket

Kat smiles relieved
INT CABIN - PLANE

The mystery man is NICK MERCER 32 commanding and classy
yet somehow totally genuine He carries his 40s-crooner

good looks like he has no idea that men just arenf made that
way anymore

Nick takes two glasses of champagne from the blushing Female
Flight Attendant

NICK
Thank you Lisa
He turns around to take his seat and finds Kat standing
there awkwardly

KAT
Hi Hey

NICK
Kat

Nick kisses Kat warmly on the cheek and hands her a glass of
champagne Nick totally at ease This may as well be a
candle-lit bar

NICK (CONT)
Let sit

Kat awkwardly negotiates her drink as they take their seats

KAT
Il glad you found it okay The
airport The plane I mean

Nick notices Kat anxiety tries to settle her

NICK
I really am sorry I couldnf leave
earlier I know you would have
loved a few hours to settle in
before the party

Kat melts a little That just what she was thinking

KAT
Work must be crazy right now

Nick gives Kat a quizzical look There something going on
here Though it not clear what Kat fills the space

KAT (CONT)
IMe gotta warn you you know those
families where everyone out of
their minds but at the end of the
day theyitle family so you love
them

(off his nod)

Mineandi not like that

The Flight Attendant appears with a small tray Kat notices
the womanandi cheeks flush as she fumbles Nick drink

Nick smiles warmly but deftly ends the moment Hef like a
famous person who has learned to manage his adoring fans with
casual grace
KAT (CONT)
I love my dad But since heff my
stepdad heffi technically not
family Hef more like a hostage

Kat tries to find her seat belt It under Nick

She reaches beneath him tentatively then pulls back
embarrassed

KAT (CONT)
My seat belt it

Nick pulls out the seat belt and hands it to her Kat
buckles up checks that it snug then checks again

They sit in silence as the plane starts barreling down the
runway

As they pick up speed Nick takes Kat hand She finds
comfort in his touch her need to talk abates momentarily

She is safe

Kat closes her eyes as the plane levels off then peeks over
at Nick whoffi calmly staring out the window She closes her
eyes again this time for good

EXT LONDON - ESTABLISHING - DAY
INT BAGGAGE CLAIM - HEATHROW

Nick and Kat wait at the baggage claim She looks at his
tie then down at her dress They are the exact same color

KAT
(concerned)
Please tell me youitle not wearing
that tonight

Her dress is indeed the exact same color as Nick tie

KAT

It no big deal Really It just
looks like a tailor cut off a yard
of my dress and made your tie out
of it

Nick doesn— get it He heaves one of Kat suitcases onto a
trolley full of matching suitcases

KAT (CONT)
Don— get me wrong matching
fine It atchy matchy® youMe

(re outfits)
This is matchy-matchy

Nick amused tugs the last of the bags off the carousel and

adds it to a pile of what appears to be an entire floor model
of matching luggage

NICK
You think we look like weitle trying
too hard

KAT

Exactly I want us to look like we
fit but not like weitle trying too
hard to look like we fit

(beat)
It welcome cocktails not prom
With this level of matchy-matchy we
should be drinking peach schnapps
under a bleacher somewhere

Nick laughs at Kat Then fixes her with an intense stare

NICK
Tfffl teach you a trick If you
look people in the eye theyB1
never even notice what you have on

Kat overwhelmed by his charisma is mesmerized

TEENAGER whoffi waiting his turn

ZITTY TEENAGER
I liked the red one better

NICK
Tl let her know

INT WC - HEATHROW EXPRESS

Kat alone in the WC meticulously rearranges a layer of
paper towel on the floor so she can step out of her shoes

She expertly slides off the first dress while simultaneously
pulling another one on -- not an inch of skin shows

She struggles as the train rocks back and forth

NICK (0S)
(through the door)
I bet youitle doing that girl thing
where you get undressed without
showing any skin

Kat looks around suspiciously

KAT
No IM not

Kat gives the passenger an appreciative smile then flies
back into the bathroom Nick amused by her antics steps

ANOTHER WOMAN PULLING OFF HER DRESS

INT AMy4 BATHROOM
The woman is Kati sister AMY ELLIS 28 She graces a bath
mat in all her infinite nakedness Totally nude she gently
places her veil on her head and begins the ablutions of a
Greek goddess A dot of bath oil a pure white towel one
squirt self-tanner one squirt lotion

Finally she pulls out a bottle of olive oil pours two drops
into her hands and rubs them together

Then she stares in the mirror regarding herself with a look
so blank it could be anything from admiration to revulsion

Just then a KNOCK
The groom EDWARD FLETCHER-WOOTEN 31 enters wearing a

robe He flashes Amy as he does a silly dance then smothers
her inside his robe Amy giggles and tries to break free

At first shef laughing but then she turns on a dime and
shoves him off more forcefully than she meant to

She kisses him on the lips trying to cover and shoos him
out the door

INT BUNNY2 DRESSING ROOM
The mother of the bride BUNNY ELLIS 60 drops her robe on
the floor She is about to put on a bra when she catches her

reflection in a full-length mirror on the door

She is momentarily surprised by what she sees She turns and
faces her image This is not the woman she is in her head

This is an old woman with uncooperative skin With one swift
movement she slams the door

INT ELLIS HOUSE - ST JOHNH woop

The father of the bride VICTOR ELLIS 65 wearing only a
pair of socks walks downstairs Hes completely comfortable
in his nakedness and trots around as if hes fully clothed
He sings to himself The words of the song are
incomprehensible but he sings with an unrestrained Sinatra
sass

Victor enters the kitchen opens the fridge and starts
scrounging Inside the fridge door Victor bends over and
his bare butt sticks out As he closes the fridge door we
cut to

A SHOWER DOOR SLIDING OPEN

INT JEFFREY4 FLAT

Inside the best man JEFFREY JOHNSON 31 the guy from the
snapshot under Kati bed glistens with a post-shower flush
Jeffrey towels off with a miniscule washcloth

Stepping out of the bathroom Jeffrey notices an 18-year-old
NYMPHETTE watching him through her kitchen window He
crosses to the window but instead of closing the blinds he

opens them wider and jumps up onto a pull-up bar

The Nymphette blushes and looks away As he starts pumping
and his manhood rises dangerously close to frame we

Teenager was right It really hot

Kat starts doing a yoga breath of fire trying to relax
Nick takes Kat hand and pulls her close

NICK

Kat nods clearly not okay Nick smooths a piece of hair
behind her ear There is a practiced intimacy to the way he
touches her and Kat is almost settled by it

KAT

Nick moves towards Kat as if he going to kiss her but then
he whispers in her ear

NICK
Youitle never going to be sure of

ON JEFFREY searching the crowd for someone His eyes land
on Kat She doesn€ see him He stares at her meaningfully

BUNNY (CONT)
It funny We always thought wel®

once but that crashed and burned

Nervous laughter from the crowd Kat smiles through the
pain Jeffrey winces sympathetically His mind working he
spots a piano nearby

BUNNY (CONT)
Still we had reason to hope She
was always one of the more Bandctive
girls at the American school and
that saying a lot

Suddenly a loud lovely arpeggio from the piano Bunny
looks over surprised Then she smiles

ANGLE ON JEFFREY sitting at the piano playing

BUNNY (CONT)

Ed moved in next door and fell in
love withthe girl next door

Everyone claps as Jeffrey plays a final flourish

Kat slithers past Jeffrey into the WC
INT WC - LANESBOROUGH HOTEL

Kat wills her breath back She turns on the water as if she

Tl not as square as my daughter
thinks

As Kat parents walk away Bunny flirtatiously sidles up to
Victor and pulls him into their bedroom

KAT
She must have drowned her rules in
the Chardonnay
With that Kat closes the door

INT KATH ROOM

The door CLICKS shut and the happy couple separates
instantly Kat to one side of the room Nick to the other

Kati childhood bedroom has an aggressively floral decor
KAT
Sorry about the creepy room I
went through a painfully earnest
Laura-Ashley phase

Kat takes a brown envelope out of her purse opens it and
removes A STACK OF HUNDREDS

She hands the pile of money to Nick

KAT
Count it Six thousand even

Nick doesn£ look at the money just tucks it into his bag

NICK
I trust you

Kat almost lets it go but then

KAT
No count it anyway

NICK

KAT

Nick humors her Pulls out the stack of bills and counts

KAT (CONT)
Six thousand right

NICK
On the nose
(beat)
I tell you what because youitle so
cute IffBl take care of our
incidentals

KAT
How does it feel to get that much
money just for being you

NICK
(wryly)
Great with the occasional stabs of
shame Now listen this covers
the weekend but as we discussed
if you want to be intimate we talk
money before anything happens

KAT

That won€ be an issue believe me
I find the idea of sex for money
morally repugnant

(realizing)
No offense

NICK
It okay Hell IMe never paid
for it But please donf feel like
you have to explain yourself to me

Kat walks over to an old dollhouse Its rooms have been

it
gutted their mini furnishings replaced with a teenagerf
cassette-tape collection

Kat pulls out Guns and Roses® and®ppetite for Destruction® and

opens it There no tape inside just some nicotine
patches Nick watches as she opens one up and slaps it on

NICK
You quitting

KAT
Il desperate to start but I donff
have an addictive personality
Except for approval That I canft
get enough of

Nick notices an ©80s poster of two guys with guitars all big
hair and laser light shows

NICK
Who are they

KAT
Graham Russell and Russell
Hitchcock

Nick thinks about those names for a second then his face
twists

NICK
Air Supply

Embarrassed Kat hastily rips down the poster and stuffs it
in the closet

KAT
My parents had a German exchange
student a few years back He

must have left it here

Nick hides a smile as Kat ducks into the bathroom

INT KATH BATHROOM

Kat has left the door open a crack as she gets ready for a
shower Unbeknownst to her Nick watches from the bed
enjoying the ritual

KAT
(quietly)
Everyone knows their greatest hits
but some of their lesser-known
ballads are surprisingly poignant

Inexplicably Kat stands on her tiptoes as she looks into the
mirror It a little thing maybe the tiles are cold but
it gives her an innocence that makes Nick smile

KAT
What

NICK
It cute

KAT
What is

NICK

You stand on your tiptoes

KAT
I do

Kat looks down she never noticed before
NICK
Is it an old habit from ballet
class or a childhood spent walking

on eggshells

She throws him a glance impressed with the sharpness of his
mind

KAT
I never took ballet

She smiles and kicks the door closed with her foot

INT KATH ROOM - LATER

Nick hangs up his tux It definitely not a rental Kat
comes out of the bathroom drying her hair with a towel

KAT
Have you ever done anything like
this before

NICK

KAT

Nick thinks about that Kat wonders what taking him so
long

NICK

NICK
How did you know that was me

KAT

NICK
(sharply)
Your Mtriend® guaranteed my
anonymity

KAT
If it makes you feel any better to
get your number I had to cough up
two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam
and a case of mini-Baileys

Nick shakes his head at her and pulls off his shirt Kat
instinctively looks away

NICK
You can look It part of the
package

Kat can€ tell if hel joking She sneaks a look as Nick
disappears into the shower Wow Kat looks down at the
papers in her hand She moves towards the bathroom but at
the last minute shies away

NICK (0S)
Would you grab my shampoo

KAT
Shampoo got it

Kat grabs the shampoo and rushes into the bathroom
INT KATH BATHROOM

Without looking in the shower Kat hands him the shampoo and
hurries out way too quickly Nick peeks out of the shower
curtain Sheff gone He shakes his head and closes the
curtain Suddenly Kat reappears She stands by the door

KAT
The part where you were a sexual
surrogate and then started to um
freelance Is that really how it
happened

Kat pretends to straighten things up as she moves closer to
the shower

NICK
The real story is that my mother
was a hippie And a stripper She
was insanely inappropriate with me
She used to wash her lingerie in my
bathwater While I was still in
the bath

KAT
Oh no

NICK
Yeah As an adult I needed to find
some way to experience intimacy and
sex but with rules that couldnff be
violated

Kati totally engrossed now She closes the toilet lid and
sits down

KAT
Wow

Nick pokes his head out

NICK
Yeah

Nick sees that Kati heartbroken for him feels bad

NICK (CONT)
Tl just screwing with you

Kat throws a towel at him

KAT
You shit

NICK
I have a different story for every
woman who asks I look at her and
figure out what she needs to hear
to feel okay about being with me

KAT
And you thought I respond to the
hippie stripper with no boundaries

NICK
Admit it You were disturbed but
ultimately moved

Kat gives him a dirty look then examines the article again

KAT
This part here You say and I
quote fiiach woman has the exact
love life she wants
(beat)
That seems like a pretty broad
generalization

Nick steps out of the shower Kat her eyes at the level of
his manhood covers her subtle jaw-drop Nick wraps a towel
around his waist as Kat tries to pull it together
down at the article tapping it indignantly--

KAT (CONT)
Sowhat was Ioh yeah Do you
honestly think that I want to be
single and miserable That I want
to be obsessed with some asshole
who led me on for years then -- out
of the blue -- shattered my heart

blue And second of all--

Nick levels his gaze at her

climbs up a ladder and hoists herself into the boat Nick
smiles at the strangeness of this then climbs in after her

In the cabin Kat flicks a couple of switches and a row of
lights flicker on She flicks another switch and a piercing
sea-horn BLARES the FRilliam Tell Overture She scrambles
to turn it off and checks the house for activity A dog
BARKS in the distance

Relieved Kat pushes a tape into an old radio MUSIC limps
through hollow speakers

Kat leads Nick into the cabin and onto the bed Without
taking her eyes off him Kat starts to slowly undress Her
shirt drops to the floor Then a moment later her skirt

Kat breathes deeply then reaches behind her back and flicks
open her bra We watch Kat face as she lets it fall to the

floor Kat is indeed a woman who doesn do naked -- this is
killing her

On the bed Nick doesn£ say anything just watches Kat
wants to read something into his stare Longing desire
anything But heff utterly inscrutable It both unnerving
and extremely sexy

Kat steels herself and removes her underwear She loses her
nerve momentarily and pulls them up again Finally she

slips them off and tries not to laugh as she scurries onto
the bed

Hovering lazily in the waking dream of interrupted sleep
Nick gazes at Kat In a trick of light the cabin windows
glow liquid as though the moon were reflecting off water

Nick runs his hand across Kat waist Sheff trying to hold
back He knows it and likes it He takes her face in his
hands and kisses her It amazing A different kind of
kiss They pull back and look at each other

In one swift movement he flips Kat underneath him

Suddenly the space between them collapses and they attack
each other

out of an orange juice can and
drags me over to her fort The

almost took my ear off but she was
having the time of her life

She feels like shef trapped in a horror movie Sheff got to
get out of here In a daze she turns around and heads
toward the stairs

truth

Kat stops dead her jaw stiffens When she turns and looks
at him her face is filled with loathing

KAT
I wasted two years grieving this

Kat laughs It is so close to tears that the sound catches
in her throat She shakes her head wearily and
mechanically walks up the stairs

EXT GARDEN - FLETCHER-WOOTEN ESTATE

Kat emerges like a sleepwalker She looks for Nick doesnft

me
