FADE IN
INT CAGE
We are a lab mouse
Our world is a cage the laboratory beyond the wire mesh
has the sprawling limitlessness of a universe with dark
endless voids and immense technological instruments

gleaming with celestial light

We can hear a WOMANS VOICE though we cant understand
what she is saying

There are several other lab mice in our cage and as the
voice gets closer there is sense of mounting apprehension

We fight the other mice pushing into the far corner
Suddenly the world beyond the mesh is eclipsed by the
WOMAN If we were not a mouse we might think she was

beautiful

She opens the cage and a panic erupts There is nowhere
to hide as her hand reaches in and TAKES HOLD of us

The cage seems to fall away as she LIFTS us

We can barely hear her voice over the blood pounding in
our ears

She TURNS us OVER and we see an enormous hypodermic needle
that she uses to inject us with a sapphire-blue fluid

We are then placed in a small air-tight tank There is a
small Plexiglas window and several tiny holes After a
moment we hear the HISS of VALVES OPENING

A milky fluid suddenly floods the chamber and we begin to
feel nauseous our VISION BLURRING and DISTORTING

As quickly as the fluid filled the tank it now drains

The god-like hand again LIFTS us from the tank but
something is wrong because --

We SLIP THROUGH her fingers
The GROUND RUSHES UP at us but when we hit --

We BOUNCE And BOUNCE

FLIP FLOPPING the bounces coming quicker and quicker
LOWER and LOWER until we are RACING ACROSS the floor

Free

We see the woman in her white lab coat screaming at her
assistant as they try to corral us

We DODGE ZIPPING ACROSS the floor looking for a way out
when we see set in the tile floor a drain

The WORLD SWIRLS WITH us as we DASH TOWARDS it the dark
holes widening as we DIVE at them PLUNGING HEADLONG INTO
BLACKNESS --

TUMBLING DOWN the rabbit hole

After a long silent moment we hear a MAN SNEEZE

INT DIME STORE

The DARKNESS BECOMES a curtain that is yanked open as the
same MAN steps out talking to himself

MAN
Hi Susan no Hi Susie

We realize he has just stepped out of a photo booth

We do not see his face MOVING WITH him staying waist
high as he waits for the photo strip

MAN
Howdee Susan no Hello there
Doctor Bright No no no Hello
Susan
A smoldering octave lower
MAN

Hello Susan

The green light flashes and the strip of black and white
pictures drops into the gate

We DESCEND PAST each picture of the mans face framed
tightly as if each was a panel in a comic book

Each face seems like someone who has a secret or who is
trying to look very smart

Except for the last one which looks like he was about to
sneeze
The man grabs the strip
EXT SUSAN BRIGHTS BROWNSTONE - MORNING
An upscale neighborhood Brownstones and coffee houses

Dr Susan Bright (WOMAN) steps out of her door She is
the scientist that we saw in the OPENING SCENE

She is in a hurry juggling a briefcase an armful of
books a cup of coffee and her keys as she heads for her
car

She is bent to the car door as we GLIDE UP BEHIND her

MAN
Hello Susan

The voice hits her like the Hymlich maneuver

SUSAN
Oh my God

MAN
What god would that be

She turns around and we see the man Daniel Eel OBrien
Black leather activist We cannot tell if he is dangerous
or just trying to look dangerous

SUSAN
Daniel

OBRIEN (MAN)
What No kiss Not even for old
times sake
She forces a smile and gives him a hug

His hand slips into her lab coat pocket and then away

SUSAN
When did you

OBRIEN
Been out for six months now

SUSAN
Really What have you been doing

OBRIEN
You know this and that

She smiles

SUSAN
Still chasing litterbugs

His grin has an edge to it

OBRIEN
Somebody has to

SUSAN
Same old Daniel

OBRIEN

Oh no Not by a long shot I may
look like the old Daniel OBrien

but on the inside nothing is the

same

SUSAN
Is that so

OBRIEN
Oh yeah See Susie a man doesnt
do the hard time and just pick up
where he left off Oh no The big
house does things to a man

SUSAN
The big house

OBRIEN
The big house

SUSAN

Jesus Daniel It wasnt Rykers
Island It was work camp for white
collar criminals

OBRIEN
A cage by any other name would still
smell like sweaty ugly men

Sounds like the same OBrien to her

OBRIEN
You know Ive been following your
work at Argon Labs

Her smile disappears

OBRIEN
Ive been thinking about you a lot
all these years locked up in my
cell Id tear through every issue
of the Midwest Science Journal
looking for your latest findings
watching as you slowly worked your
polymerization experiments up
through single celled organisms to
that holiest of holies the fruit
fly Exciting stuff I got to tell
you it really kept me going

SUSAN
I guess I should be flattered

OBRIEN
I remember you said nanotechnology
was going to change the world

SUSAN
It already is

OBRIEN
Ive read theyre using it to repair
cancer cells

SUSAN
And for cleaning up oil spills

OBRIEN
Right You predicted it

He moves closer eyes smoldering

OBRIEN
Do you ever wonder what happened to
us Susie

SUSAN
It was a long time ago Daniel We
were young different people
heading in different directions
Thats all

She backs away

OBRIEN
Yeah

SUSAN
Well it was good to see you
Daniel but I have to be going

OBRIEN
Sure Can I ask you one more thing
You havent published anything in a
while How come

She shrugs getting into her car

SUSAN
Nothing really worthwhile

OBRIEN
Thats what I thought
She closes the door

OBRIEN
Be seeing you

She watches him turn and walk away in the rearview mirror
She GUNS her cars ENGINE and the SOUND ROLLS INTO --

The ROAR of SMOKESTACKS gaseous flames burning into boot-
black clouds

EXT CALUMET CITY - DAY

An industrial wasteland towering smokestacks and
warehouses of corrugated steel factories and chemical
plants built around a small lake that shimmers with an
oily iridescent sheen while its shores churn a frothy
green bile

One of the more distinct buildings in this skyline of
black steel and blue-gas flame is Argon Laboratories

It is a heavily secured compound There are two oblong
buildings one is the main lab building the other is a
chemical warehouse

Where the two buildings are connected a third structure
rises on a steel framed skeleton like a water tower

This is Argon Tower and at the top of the two story
private manor built beside a helicopter pad is a
twinkling glass conservatory

INT ARGONS OFFICE

A pair of gleaming red-patent leather stiletto-heeled
SHOES CLICK delicately across the floor

WOMAN
Icarus

We FOLLOW the high heels THROUGH the office until we see
the base of a statue and the name chiseled into stone
Icarus Argon

We RISE UP the nine-heads-high heroically proportioned
statue and see Icarus Argon as he once was a single
halogen high-lights the massive David-like physique

She crosses the sprawl of the office and everywhere are
mementos marking the milestones of Argons life His face
beams on framed magazine covers Peoples Sexiest Man
Alive and Times Man of the Year A 1989 Mr Universe
trophy is almost lost in the thicket of awards

The Woman calls to the wheelchair-bound figure slouching
behind a black obelisk-like desk

WOMAN
Icarus I thought I would find you
here

She is Mrs Poppy Argon a stunning woman of cosmetic
perfection and a body that might have been surgically cut
from a comic book

She designs her own dresses made from Argon rubber or PVC
usually red to match her collection of high heeled shoes
and boots

POPPY (WOMAN)
You never came to bed

He says nothing

POPPY
Have you been here all night

She moves around him and we get our first look at the new
Icarus Argon

POPPY
How are you feeling today

He is an unwrapped mummy brown flesh drapes over stringy
cords of muscle like a wet paper bag His eyes hard
white marbles lined with red cracks coldly stare up at
her

ARGON (MAN)
I feel like I felt yesterday

She feels his forehead

ARGON
Like rotting meat

POPPY
Youre not rotting meat

He lifts his arm

ARGON
Oh no Smell this

POPPY
Icarus please if you want me to

give you a bath just say so

ARGON
No Im getting used to it

She opens a manila folder setting several sheets of paper
on a tray in front of him

POPPY
Fine Now I need your signature on
this today

He snatches the pen from her and begins signing everything
she lays in front of him

ARGON
What about Dr Bright

Poppy sighs

POPPY
Shes working as fast as she can
Icarus It will be ready soon

ARGON
Its ready now I know it is

POPPY
She says its not

ARGON
Shes lying She lost the first one
on purpose

POPPY
She did not The mouse ran down the
drain

ARGON

She let it escape because she wants
me to die

POPPY
Dont be a child Icarus She is
just another scientist and like all
scientists she doesnt care about
anything outside the world of the
laboratory

She gathers her papers back into the folder

POPPY
Right now she is still concerned
about the unstable molecular waste
generated by the first experiment
I am sure that when she solves that
problem she will be ready for the
second test

She pats him on the head

POPPY
Now you be a good boy today and take
your medicine and Poppy will make
you forget about everything tonight

She blows him a kiss wiggling her long red-nailed
fingers

EXT MAIN GATE

Susan Brights car rolls up to the main gate Inside her
car she is searching for her security card key

The GUARD notices and steps out of the booth She rolls
down the window

GUARD
Something wrong Dr Bright

SUSAN
I cant find my key card

GUARD
Not a problem Just let us know if
its lost and well make you a new
one

SUSAN
Thanks

He returns to the booth and the gate arm waves up
EXT ADMIRAL HOTEL - DAY

A poorly painted sign in the window reads Transients
Welcome

INT ADMIRAL HOTEL

CLOSE ON Susan Brights Argon ID as an x-acto knife
carefully cuts out the photo

OBrien is hunched over working diligently The hotel
room behind him is the kind of place where cheap would
be the politically correct adjective

There are piles of nondescript scientific journals and
reference texts everywhere The walls around him are
covered with clipped articles and we repeatedly glimpse
the words nanotechnology molecular engineering
assemblers and replicators

Using a colored marker he colors in one of the serious-
looking black and white photos from the strip

There are only twelve colors in the set of markers so the
result looks somewhere between Warhol and Turner-vision

He compares it to the color photo of Susan Shrugs good
enough
INT SUSAN BRIGHTS LAB

Susan is not listening her face as frozen as her picture
her mind somewhere else

NEBBLEMAN
Without the nanobot it appears there
will be no way to stabilize the
waste entirely Even at subzero
temperatures it remains active

DR NIGEL NEBBLEMAN is Susans assistant More nebbish
than man

NEBBLEMAN
I wonder if there is a way we could
catch that mouse Susan Susan are
you listening to me

She blinks
SUSAN

What Oh Im sorry Nigel I was
just thinking

NEBBLEMAN
Aaabout

SUSAN
This morning I saw someone I

havent seen in a long time

NEBBLEMAN
A man

SUSAN
Yeah I knew him when I was still
in school

NEBBLEMAN
What did he want

SUSAN
Im not sure Thats the funny
thing about him Hes the kind of
guy that you never know what he
wants or what he might do to get it

EXT STREET

OBrien is moving against the general flow of traffic on a
crowded street

He notices a MAN in a business suit with a briefcase in
one hand a white Styrofoam cup of coffee in the other
The Man apparently in a hurry slugs down the last of the
coffee crumbles the cup in his fist and without a second
thought tosses the cup into the hedge

OBRIEN
Hey

The suit walks right past him oblivious to OBriens
outrage

OBrien looks back at the cup and then the Man A single
word hisses from his lips

OBRIEN
Litterbug

He rushes to the hedge and seizes hold of the cup then
whirls back chasing after the bug

OBRIEN
Hey Hey you Hey litterbug
Mr Litterbug

He grabs the bug by the shoulder and spins him around

OBRIEN
Excuse me but I believe you dropped
this

The Litterbug a very large litterbug laughs

LITTERBUG (MAN)
Yeah So what

OBRIEN
So what So what For starters
how about littering is a crime

LITTERBUG
Haw-haw Why dont you run off and
find a cop and Ill wait right here

OBRIEN
Why dont you just put this in your
pocket so when you see a garbage can
you can put it where it belongs

LITTERBUG
Why dont you just shove it up your
ass Haw-haw

The Litterbug starts walking away but OBrien continues
to dog him

OBRIEN
What is it with you litterbugs Is
it a territorial thing marking your
turf with your garbage

LITTERBUG
You better quit pushing me pal

OBRIEN
I just want to know what goes on in
the mind of a litterbug What
chemical is secreted by your smooth
brain that tells you ‘Its okay
just chuck it

LITTERBUG
Look asshole I dont got time for
this If you got a problem you
better take care of it yourself

OBRIEN
Oh no no no No can do You
enjoyed a tasty beverage and thus
this receptacle becomes your
responsibility and I dont care if
its a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon
Valdez Youve got to learn to take
responsibility

LITTERBUG
What are you going to do Make me
throw it out

OBRIEN
Ill do whatever I have to do

Fists clench as they eye one another up and down until the
Litterbug laughs again

LITTERBUG
Jee-sus Youre crazy as catshit
You win Gimme the cup

Smiling OBrien starts to give him the cup

OBRIEN
Believe me later on youll feel a
lot better about this

When suddenly the Litterbug seizes OBriens wrist
yanking him off balance as he pops him square in the nose

A second blow to the gut doubles OBrien over anda
briefcase to the back of the head drops him to the
sidewalk

LITTERBUG
Later on youre going to feel a
whole lot worse Haw-haw
He kicks him in the gut

LITTERBUG
Next time mind your own business

He walks away as OBrien squeezes the styrofoam CUP
CRACKING it in his fist

OBRIEN
No good stinking litterbug

INT SUSAN BRIGHTS LAB

Susan is still talking to Nebbleman

SUSAN
Do you remember about five years
ago that uh incident at Purnell
Labs

NEBBLEMAN

Oh yeah They were working on
molecular assemblers too werent
they

SUSAN
ey also tried using viral RNA
s the bonding element

oH

NEBBLEMAN
Thats right CDC found out and
closed them down

Susan looks into the mouse cage as Nebbleman remembers the
rest

NEBBLEMAN
Yeah somebody broke in and stole
the samples one of those animal
rights groups right I remember
now they freed all the monkeys
which caused that huge pileup on the
Massachusetts Turnpike right

SUSAN
Yeah But it wasnt a group It
was one man

NEBBLEMAN
Thats the guy

She nods
NEBBLEMAN

And you think he knows what were
doing here
She nods again

Oh

EXT MAIN GATE

NEBBLEMAN

A security card slides through the gate box

The arm raises and Daniel OBrien drives in waving to the

security man who absently waves back

INT SECURITY OFFICE

We GLIDE THROUGH the frosted glass and out THROUGH the

inverted letters spelling SECURITY

SIM

So you think this psycho-
environmentalist character stole
your security key to break into the

lab

The head of Argon Security sitting behind his enormous
desk is DT SIM a little guy with something to prove

His silent partner is Doby an enormous man with the face

of a mastiff

SUSAN
It might be paranoia but Ive never
lost my keycard before

SIM
‘Paranoia is what separates the
secured from the unsecured

He smiles enjoying his own cleverness

SIM
Just a little saying weve got in
the security business Dr Bright
We get paid to be paranoid We
worry so you dont have to

He lights a stogie

SIM
A lot of people think security is
just a job but for me its a way of
life Its a state of mind

He blows a cloud of smoke into the air

SIM
If this nutcase did take it and has
half a brain hed use it right
away before we could invalidate it

SUSAN
Yes that is what I was thinking

SIM
In fact would it be safe to say
based on your general knowledge of
this character that he is already
in the building

SUSAN
Yes he might be

INT ARGON LAB - CLOSE ON COLORED ID
that OBrien forged clipped to the pocket of a lab coat

We notice that he also inked in some dark glasses and a
moustache

Smiling nodding he moves through the busy corridors with
a sense of inconspicuous conspicuousness

Susan appears from around a corner walking toward him as
he turns away Something about the tall moustached man
catches her eye when --

NEBBLEMAN
Susan Susan

Nebbleman hurries to catch up

NEBBLEMAN
What did security say

SUSAN
Theyll in validate the key
Probably nothing

NEBBLEMAN
Well you got another problem

SUSAN
The replicators

NEBBLEMAN
Worse Mrs Argon wants to talk to
you Shes waiting in the lab

SUSAN
This day just keeps going from bad

to worse

INT SUSAN BRIGHTS LAB
FROM INSIDE the mouse cage we see Poppy looking DOWN AT
us Her perfect red lips slightly curling into a sneer

POPPY
Vermin

SUSAN (0OS)
Can I help you Mrs Argon

As Susan enters the lab Nebbleman fades back and
disappears

POPPY
I spoke to Dr Argon this morning
and he remains frustrated over the
loss of the original nanobot

SUSAN
I am aware of Dr Argons
frustrations

POPPY

He believes that the second nanobot
should be ready for testing by now

Susan does not want to hear this now

SUSAN
Dr Argon is going to have to muster
a little patience I was rushed
into testing the nanobot on that
mouse and now we are dealing with a
toxic waste that has the potential
to make Three Mile Island look like
spilled milk

Susan stares daggers

SUSAN
Under the circumstances I cant
fathom what makes Dr Argon think we
are ready for anything bigger If
CNN or hell if the EPA knew
what was in my basement --

POPPY
Is that a threat Dr Bright

SUSAN
Look as I have said and will
continue to say the instability of
the assembler waste remains my
priority --

POPPY
While you remain on the staff at
Argon Laboratories your priorities
will always be the same as Dr
Argons priorities I imagine that
is a simple enough equation for a
bright girl like you to figure out

Poppy smiles Susan suppresses the urge to smash her head
with a microscope

POPPY
If you dont have any questions
Ill let you get back to doing your
job

SUSAN
Just one question Since Dr Argon
no longer has feeling below his
waist how is it that youre still
able to do your job

Poppy glances up at the security camera in the far corner
She leans close to Susan and whispers

POPPY
I could have you fired right now

SUSAN
You wont Thats why youre
whispering

Poppy glares at her then spins on her heels and leaves

Still fuming Susan turns to a special computerized
vault-like machine which is the nanobot freon-containment
system

At the top there is a sealed plate that is connected to
an electron microscope

She touches the plate almost lovingly letting her anger
drain away

Nebbleman skulks back in

NEBBLEMAN
He wants another test

She says nothing

NEBBLEMAN
I bet he hasnt read a single report
weve written on the waste problem

SUSAN
I hope youre right Id feel a lot
worse if he had read them and just
didnt care
NEBBLEMAN
What are you going to do

SUSAN
What Ive always done As long as
Im the only one who can build the
nanobot Im the only one who can
say when it should be tested

As they return to work we RISE UP TO the unblinking eye
of the security camera

INT SECURITY BOOTH

The security booth is Sims world he is intimate with
every detail of each small framed monitor

SIM
Hey Dobe Ever wonder if this is
how God feels looking down on us

Doby says nothing

SIM
Yeah me neither

EXT ARGON LABS - DAY

The sun a brilliant ball of lemon yellow slowly begins
to curdle --

Transmogrifying into a full moon pale and winter blue
against a night sky

INT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT

A dark room filled with barrels labeled EXPLOSIVE
MATERIALS CONTAINS TRINITROTOLUENE

A barrel lid cracks open Two eyes peek out

OBrien unfolds himself awkwardly climbing out of the
empty barrel

INT STAIRWELL
OBrien slithers up the stairs clinging to every shadow
INT HALL

Like a ghost he glides down the dark empty halls moving
only when the surveillance cameras pan away

INT SUSAN BRIGHTS LAB

The DOOR HICCUPS and OBrien slips inside
On hands and knees he crawls toward the center of the lab
where the nanobot is stored

Again we PEER OUT THROUGH the wire mesh of the mouse cage
OBriens head POPS UP IN FRONT of us

OBRIEN
Oh no POWs

He ducks down just as the camera sweeps overhead He pops
back up

Opening the cage he frees all of the little mice

OBRIEN
Never leave a man behind

He grabs the last one ducking under the arc of the
camera

INT SECURITY BOOTH
There is a flash of white in the corner of Susans lab

SIM
Did you see that

Doby nods

SIM
Looked like a mouse

INT SUSAN BRIGHTS LAB
The cage is empty

OBrien finds the security panel of the nanobot
containment system He sprinkles graphite dust on the
keypad

When he blows on the dust four numbers remain covered
1-6-8-9 From his pocket he pulls out a folded paper

It is filled with a list of all the numbers relevant to
Susans life such as birthdays phone numbers and
significant dates

His thumb stops at August 6th 1991 Birth of Nanobot

OBRIEN
Never good at remembering numbers
were you Susie

He types the date and the pressurized SEALS GASP The
plate rises revealing a glass tube filled with a sapphire
blue liquid
OBRIEN
Thats your baby aint it

He is about to touch it when the lab DOOR suddenly swings
OPEN

He ducks Holding his breath he waits The room is
silent

Slowly quietly he peeks out A flashlight blinks near
him and he ducks back down

He hears a WHISPER

Panicking he starts to creep toward the door when a beam
of light suddenly pools around him

SIM
Look what we caught here

OBrien cant see because of the light in his eyes

SIM
One big muther of a mouse

OBrien bolts running straight into Dobys chest

A giant fist hammers down onto the top of his skull as his
eyes roll up into his head

FADE
BLACK

FADE IN
ON NIGHTMARE
trapped beneath searing laboratory overhead lights
Argons hideous face HOVERS OVER us a cracked lipless
smile revealing ulcerous gums and stained teeth
ARGON
Ive been waiting for something like
this my whole life
The voices warp through the watery space
POPPY
Bad boy got caught with his hand in
the cookie jar

The faces float over OBrien like disembodied heads

SIM
You should have stayed in jail pal

TO
Argon grips OBriens head under the chin Poised between
his fingers is a gleaming stainless steel hypodermic
needle

ARGON
For every environmentalist anti-
industrialist animal activist that
has shoved their myopic
protectionist cause-of-the-month
crap down my throat I shove this
down yours

He sticks the needle into OBriens neck OBriens eyes
flutter the voices and faces stretching away

Argons thumb depresses the plunger

POPPY
You sure you know what youre doing
Icky

INSIDE the hypo blood blossoms all around us as the
sapphire fluid containing the nanobot is injected into
OBrien

We RUSH with blurred speed INTO his blood stream as we see
the nanobot a microbiotic machine that resembles a
snowflake

As it bounces from protein cell to cell falling AWAY FROM
us it begins to blur as we hear what sounds like MUZAK

The shapes FOCUS again as we realize that we are now
LOOKING DOWN INTO the aisle of a grocery store

The two parts of the nanobot become OBrien and Susan
joined together by the grocery cart they are pushing

FLASHBACK - INT GROCERY STORE

It is the 1970s OBrien is a granola hippie activist
type extra crunchy Susan still loves Oreo cookies

SUSAN
Nanotechnology is going to change
the world Danny Im telling you
in ten maybe twenty years life is
going to be a totally new kind of
experience

OBrien is not listening repulsed by the stock lining the
shelves

SUSAN
And what I love about molecular
science is the way it revolutionizes
how we have to think It unifies
the entire world on a single level
Everything is completely connected
Sometimes I can really feel it
everything around us just a small
part of a whole Its really
wonderful

OBRIEN
Yeah well see

SUSAN
Well see What does that mean

OBRIEN
Well see how wonderful it is after
you spend the next twenty years
making Agent Orange

SUSAN
God Daniel Im not going to make
Agent Orange

OBRIEN
You think the chemists that invented
Agent Orange twenty years ago were
in school saying Boy I really got
some good ideas for a highly toxic
incendiary defoliant You think
Oppenheimer was dreaming about
mushroom clouds before the war

She tries to ignore him

SUSAN
Weve had this conversation already
Daniel

OBRIEN

All Im saying is that the companies
that have money for the kind of
research youre interested in have
money because thats what theyre
interested in Money

She stops the cart

SUSAN
Im sorry I brought the whole thing
up If youre gonna flip your wig --

OBRIEN
I cant help it Suze Its this
place You know how I get in these
stores They freak me out All
these tiny boxes little cans filled
with eight syllable God knows what
He grabs a can of Spam

OBRIEN
Look at this Theyve taken all the
food out of food When you start
talking about the future this is
what I see Huge vats of Spam You
are what you eat and theyre turning
us into Spam-people

He shoves the can back into the shelf

OBRIEN
You think its a coincidence that
they have all these aisles lined up
like this like a little maze
Were all lab rats running through
their maze pulling lever A or lever
B each designed to create some kind
of bio-chemical dependency All the
while theyre everywhere watching
us two-way mirrors surveillance
cameras nodding to each other
making little notes

SUSAN
Youre insane

OBRIEN
Am I Look Right there Thats
exactly what I am talking about

A little BOY is trying to get a box of Trix cereal froma
shelf that is too high

OBRIEN
Lever A

He jumps several times unable to grab the economy-sized
box OBrien walks over to him

SUSAN
Daniel Dont -- Oh no

The tips of the kids fingers are slowly coaxing the box
from the edge

OBRIEN
Let me help you kid

The Kids face widens into a smile until OBrien pushes
the box back

KID (BOY)
Hey

OBRIEN
You dont want this

KID
Yeah I do

OBRIEN
You have no idea what this is doing

to your body

KID
I like Trix

SUSAN
Daniel give him the Trix

OBRIEN
Susan this is the future of America

here

KID
Trix are for kids

OBrien grabs a box of Shredded Wheat
OBRIEN
Here kid this is great stuff Why

dont you give it a try

KID
I want Trix Mommy

The Boys wail swells unnaturally loud as we rise up
DISTORTING as it becomes --

The PRESSURIZING of the TEST TANK
INT TEST TANK
OBrien jerks awake He is inside a dark steel capsule

There is a WET SUCKING NOISE as the hoses are opened and
the white assembler fluid begins pumping into the tank

OBRIEN
Mommy

INT LAB

Argon watches the gauges climbing on the tanks with a mad
gleam in his eye

Poppy stares at the computer flickering through the model
simulation

POPPY
Icky this is so exciting
Sim looks a bit nervous

SIM
How long do you leave him in there

ARGON
Until hes done

He laughs until the tank shivers

The whole unit is now sizzling hot A coolant line
bursts

Each of them backs away as the tank vibrates under
mounting pressure like a water balloon that is ready to
burst

POPPY
Icky

The TANK EXPLODES splitting open like a can of whipped
cream

We see the world THROUGH the eyes of OBrien as he rises
from the burbling marshmallow-amnion Everything has a
sense of UNNATURAL VISCOSITY as if reality had been remade
with molasses

The room CURVES and WARPS our eyes like carnival mirrors
We see a DISTORTED ARGON staring at us in awe

ARGON
My God it works

Now we see OBrien

He has been completely polymerized his entire body
shifting and flowing like a drunken wave machine

The rubbery flesh of his face looks too heavy hanging
slack His eyes bulge and loll as he tries to focus

ARGON
Grab him Hurry Grab him

Doby is the closest and he snatches OBriens arm
OBrien reacts yanking his arm which thins to a strand of
spaghetti and whips free

OBrien stumbles backwards quivering like a Jell-O Slinky
until his bare foot which seems more a puddle than a
foot lands on the main floor drain

His leg slips immediately through the sieve as he slaps
down to the floor one leg sprawled out in front of him

He blinks
Then the rest of him falls through

Sim grabs at the pile of clothes covering the drain but
Daniel OBrien is gone

FROM BELOW the drain we LOOK UP at Argon and the others
staring down

SIM
Thats impossible

POPPY
Its a miracle

ARGON

Its an organic-polymerization

Behind them the tank core continues to melt down
gelatinous waste splattering the room

POPPY
Icky Whats happening

ARGON
Who cares Weve got to find him
Hurry
His chair heads for the door

INT STORM DRAIN

A six inch pipe opening GROANS with the sound of
STRETCHING RUBBER

Fingers suddenly reach out and grab the edge of the hole

There are a series of CARTOON-LIKE SOUNDS as OBrien pulls
himself out emerging from the opening like toothpaste

After a struggle he pops free snapping into normal human
proportions

Cradling his head he stands up in the corrugated metal
drain

Unsure of what has happened or why he is naked he
stumbles out into the creek his bare feet squishing into
the muddy water

EXT ARGON LABS

The moon throbs overhead in a sky of dark crushed velvet

Sim and Dobys flashlight beams dart and bounce as they
sweep the compound
They find the drain pipe and Sim throws his beam down it
careful not to get his shoes muddy

SIM
Ah for the love of God I aint
going in there

He looks at Doby

SIM
You check it out

INT ELEVATOR

Poppy and Argon ride up in the elevator that connects the
main lab to Argon Tower

ARGON
It works Poppy It works it
works

POPPY

Now Icky I dont need you winding
yourself up I need you focused and
in control

ARGON
But Poppy you dont know what this
means --

POPPY

You dont either We wont know
anything until we find that guy and
find out if hes alive or what

ARGON
Yes thats true We have to find
him run tests determine if the
polymerization is stable

POPPY
In the meantime were going to need
someone to deal with that mess in
the lab I dont think we should
call Dr Bright

ARGON
Oh no No Well get her
assistant Whats-his-name
Nebbishman

POPPY
Nebbleman

INT MAIN LAB

Nigel Nebbleman enters the building He is wearing a
raincoat over his pajamas that are covered with small
bunny rabbits

Poppy is waiting for him

POPPY
Dr Nebbleman thank God youre
here

In her high heels she is taller than him and when they
embrace his head lays against her ample bosom

POPPY
Ive been nearly hysterical with
fright Thank God you came I feel
so much better that youre here

NEBBLEMAN
What happened

Poppy leads him to the stairwell

POPPY
As I told you on the phone theres
been an accident A terrible
accident

INT SUSAN BRIGHTS LAB

We hear Nebblemans voice crack with panic as he rushes
towards the double doors of the lab

NEBBLEMAN (0S)
Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God

The moment he bursts in and sees the ruptured test tank
melting into the white mucous of the assembler waste --

He faints

POPPY
Great

INT ARGONS OFFICE

Nebbleman lifts his face from the paper bag he was
breathing in Panic is cracking his voice

NEBBLEMAN
Okay Alright Okey-dokey Now
we need the nanobot The nanobot
that initiated the reaction Once
we have that we can stabilize the
meltdown Simple really No
problem

ARGON
The nanobot is gone
Nebblemans voice rises several octaves

NEBBLEMAN
Gone What do you mean gone Gone
where

His knees buckle as Argon does not answer

ARGON
Dr Nebbleman we are scientists
you and I and men of science are not
concerned with emotions and
opinions We are concerned with
facts

Nebbleman is hyperventilating like a mouse caught in a
glue trap

ARGON
The fact is that the milk has been
spilled and now we need you to tell
us how to clean it up

NEBBLEMAN
Cleaned up It cant be cleaned up
Without the nanobot the waste cant
be stabilized Thats what weve
been trying to tell you The only
thing we can do is run Run Run

Argon signals to Poppy Poppy slaps Nebbleman Nebbleman
is quiet

ARGON
Facts Dr Nebbleman Facts
Youve been using cryogenics to
control the waste from the mouse
experiment havent you

NEBBLEMAN
Well yes The replicators are not
as active at low temperatures

ARGON
Then perhaps we can use liquid
nitrogen to keep the meltdown under
control

NEBBLEMAN
That might work

ARGON
Poppy order the trucks from the
Gary plant And were going to need
a containment crew
POPPY
A containment crew is going to
attract a lot of attention

ARGON
Youre right Place a call to our
friends at the network and to Mr
Joplin at the EPA

NEBBLEMAN
How did this happen How did the
nanobot activate the assembler
fluid If Im going to help I
have to know what happened

Argon studies Nebbleman for a moment
ARGON
All right Dr Nebbleman Come with
me and Ill tell you everything

Motoring his chair around Argon leads Nigel to the
conservatory

The elevator slides open and Sim gets out leading a muddy
Doby

POPPY
Mr Sim did you find him

Sim has OBriens wad of clothes tucked under his arm
SIM
No but if hes alive I think I know
where he might go

He holds up the key to OBriens hotel room the plastic
key chain stamped Admiral Hotel

INT ADMIRAL HOTEL - NIGHT
A muddy bare footprint black grime against green shag

We PULL BACK and see another then another the tracks
leading toward the white light of the bathroom door

We CLOSE IN ON the bilious white of the steam the warble
of OBrien whimpering and shivering even in the scalding
water

He begins to sneeze and cough as if something were
tickling the back of his throat He snorts at it
inhaling through his nose trying to suck it out

Finally he spits a clear silicon-like wad of phlegm that
remains connected to his mouth by a long rubbery strand
He spits at it and it stretches until he flicks it off
with his hand

It hangs on the wall for a moment like a sticky rubber
slug before being swept down the tub drain

INT SUSAN BRIGHTS LAB
We RISE THROUGH the floor drain

Wearing a special insulated contamination suit Nebbleman
is on hands and knees examining the lab floor

He lifts a hand and we see an impression that gradually
fades as if the ground were a sheet of foam

He slaps it hard and the tile ripples like a waterbed

NEBBLEMAN
Oh God its worse than I thought

He runs for the door leaving a trail of footprints

NEBBLEMAN
Get that crew in here Now

EXT ARGON LAB - NIGHT
Outside the lab a flurry of activity erupts

Thick hoses are attached to the belly of giant tanker
trucks

Brilliant portable kliegs illuminate the grounds like a
ball park

Men in bulbous insulated space suits milk the tankers
filling scuba-like canisters that are worn on their backs

The bold letters on the back of the tanker read WARNING
-- LIQUID NITROGEN

Slowly we MOVE TOWARD the 0 in NITROGEN It OPENS in
front of us like a yawning tunnel which we DESCEND INTO

INT ADMIRAL HOTEL ROOM - DAY
OBrien is in a deep sleep mouth wide open his breathing
rasped Turning his face deeper into his pillow he is

suddenly unable to breathe

He sucks for air with a strained gurgle His eyes pop
open still suffocating and he bolts upright

We see that his neck has been twisted around like a
knotted sheet
His head spins around and snaps back into place
OBRIEN
Mommy
He is dizzy and confused He rubs his head and neck
panic seeping into his expression as he begins to remember
last nights events
He looks down seeing the muddy footprints on the carpet

OBrien touches his neck where he was injected

OBRIEN
Uh oh

Suddenly the door whaps open Sim and Doby FILLING the
FRAME

SIM
Good morning Mr OBrien

Still in his underwear OBrien jumps from the bed

OBRIEN
You I remember you

SIM
Im real touched Now get your
Sundays on Were going for a
ride

He throws OBriens pants at him

OBRIEN
What Im not going anywhere

SIM
Oh yes you are

OBRIEN
I get it Youre the goon fetch
boy The zookeeper Argon calls in
when one of his guinea pigs gets
loose

SIM

Thats right
Sim opens his coat showing OBrien his firearm
SIM

Only this aint no tranquilizer gun
Now lets go
OBRIEN
Forget it pissboy You tell Argon
he can call my lawyer

Sim reaches for his gun

SIM
The hard way it is

OBrien heaves a Yellow Pages at Sim which sails past his
head He leaps behind the coffee table

Sim points the gun at OBriens head
SIM
Not smart You forgot Ive got the

gun

OBrien on his toes keeps the table in between him and
Sim
OBRIEN
Then lets see you use it bucko
Dr Argons not going to take it
very well that you killed his
experiment

Sim snorts

SIM
Okay Okay Doby

He waves Doby to the other side of the table But before
they can grab him OBrien spins away from Sim and bolts
for the window

He throws it open yelling

OBRIEN
Help Somebody help me

Sim and Doby tackle him from behind

SIM
Ill take care of this Hold him

Sim raises his gun high into the air --

SIM
Lights out

And brings it down on OBriens head It rebounds off of
OBriens skull which in turn rebounds off the floor

OBRIEN
Ow
Sim raises it again

SIM
I said -- Lights out

And again smashes OBrien in the head to no effect

OBRIEN
Ouchhh Cut it out

Sim looks at the gun then repeatedly brings a hail of
blows onto OBrien whose head bounces off the gun and
floor like a dribbling basketball

OBrien grabs his head as Sim tires

OBRIEN
Jesus

Panting Sim holsters his gun

SIM
Get his legs

OBrien lunges grabbing the window sill as the two men
each take a leg

OBRIEN
No

They heave at his legs trying to wrench him from the sill
OBriens body raises off the floor

Struggling and straining with all of his might OBrien
looks up to secure his grip and his eyes go wide

OBriens arms have begun to stretch He looks back over
his shoulder to see that his legs also have begun to
stretch

Sim and Doby seem to notice at the same time that they
have stretched OBrien halfway to the door

SIM
Holy shit

The two men let go of OBriens legs and he is flung like
a slingshot out of the room

SIM
Holy shit

He cartwheels in the space outside the window splayed and
flailing spastically

The people nine floors down scream as OBrien plummets
toward them

OBriens tearing eyes clamp shut in the face of onrushing
pavement a faint sound caught in his ear An ascending
twang like a tightening guitar string

Whump OBrien hits the ground unsure if hes alive of
dead

A woman screams

He rattles his head and opens his eyes There is a woman
in front of him her face buried in her hands

OBrien tries to stand

OBRIEN
Oh God -- am I dead

Hearing him the woman peers out from shielding fingers
She looks up at his arm and screams again

OBrien is confused Slowly he turns following her gaze
up up up His arm stretches up to the ninth story
window like a safety line his hand still gripping the
sill His face contorts in horror

OBrien screams letting go

Loopy wet spaghetti strands collect on the sidewalk in a
pile as his arm falls The crowd collectively inhales
The hand plops on the top of the pile like some strange
garnish

OBrien whimpers

A CAR SCREECHES to a stop and OBrien jumps back at the
sound As he lands his body jerking to the side his arm

suddenly begins reeling in like a fishing line

The crowds heads swivel back and forth watching the arm
snap back to normal in a loud whip-crack

OBRIEN
Oh God

He cradles the arm under the stare of the gapers block
Chest heaving he stumbles back two steps

He shoots a look up at his apartment window The shadows
of Sim and Doby look down

He bolts
INT ADMIRAL HOTEL ROOM

Sim and Doby watch open-mouthed as OBrien disappears down
the street
SIM
This is going to take some
explaining

Sim whips out his cellular phone and dials

SIM
Mrs Argon Its Sim

Mr Sim Do you have him Hes
alive

SIM

Oh yeah hes alive Technically

POPPY (VO)
And you have him

SIM
We lost him

INT ARGONS OFFICE

Poppy sits atop the massive ebony slab of Argons desk
the phone pressed to her ear

She smiles and hands the phone to Argon

ARGON
Mr Sim you know I sooner kill the
messenger then listen to bad news

INT ADMIRAL HOTEL ROOM
Sim swallows hard

SIM
Dont worry there Dr Argon He
gave us the slip in a manner of
speaking But were definitely
closing in on him

Doby frowns

ARGON (VO)

not scare him off again Just watch
him I think you can handle that

Sim slams his hands on the desk and looks down to find the
pictures of Dr Bright a heart encircling it

Hello

EXT ARGON LABS - DAY

We are LOOKING THROUGH the LENS of a local network news
camera on location outside Argon Labs The CAMERA RACK
FOCUSES and PANS TO network reporter SPENCER LAMM

SPENCER
Tawney Im standing in front of the
security station just outside of
Argon Labs in Calumet City Since
seven oclock this morning when
security guards barred the weekend
staff here at Argon Labs rumors
have been circulating as to the
nature of the accident that occurred
here last night

He looks over his shoulder as an unmarked tanker rolls
past the security gate

SPENCER
All we know for sure is that at
930 am two sedans carrying the
county sheriff and men who have been
identified as high-ranking officials
of the EPA entered the Argon
offices and have not come out

INT SUSAN BRIGHTS BROWNSTONE

We PULL BACK REVEALING the reporter on television in the
kitchen

SPENCER (VO)
We expect a statement some time
today but until then we can only
speculate that whatever did happen
here which has crews working around
the clock no one was prepared for
This has been Spencer Lamm live at
Argon Labs

Susan drops her coffee cup when she hears the name She
rushes to turn up the volume but the special report is
over
She is searching the other stations when someone POUNDS on
her door

THROUGH the peep-hole she sees OBrien his face WARPED by
the WIDE-ANGLE LENS

SUSAN
Oh shit

With the chain still on she opens the door

OBRIEN
Susie You gotta help me

SUSAN
Daniel what are you doing here

OBRIEN
Please Susan I need help
Something is wrong with me

SUSAN
Sorry Daniel Im a physicist not
a psychiatrist

OBRIEN
No something is really wrong
look

He stuffs his arms into the three-inch slot between the
door and the jamb then squeezes his body and head through

Susan steps back her mouth falls open

SUSAN
You you

She points at him then at the television

OBRIEN
They did it to me

SUSAN
The nanobot

As OBrien spits the story out his gestures become more
animated

OBRIEN

Last night Argons goons grabbed
me the big one hit me probably did
severe cranio-sacral damage and bam
I drop to the floor and then Argon
was there and it became like a bad
dream Everyone was laughing as he
stuck this big needle in my neck and
then Im not sure what happened but
I came to in a metal tank and they
drowned me with white goo and I
thought I was dead everything soft
and blurry and the next thing I know
I wake up back in my hotel and
Argons goons bust in and we fight
and I fall out the window and again
I thought I was a goner but I hit
the ground and I bounce and I look
up and my arm is really really long
and I know I know I shouldnt have
been in your lab but Jesus Christ
Susan feel my skin feel it It
feels like plastic

He reaches his arm across the room and she feels his hand

SUSAN
just like the mouse

OBRIEN
Mouse What mouse

SUSAN
My first organic-polymerization was
a lab mouse

OBRIEN
What happened to it

SUSAN
I dont know

He jerks his hand away

OBRIEN
You dont know

SUSAN

It escaped from the lab before we
could finish the experiment

OBRIEN
But youve polymerized single-celled
bacteria and the fruit flies I know
you have

SUSAN
Yes

OBRIEN
Then you must have at some point

tried to reverse the procedure

She nods but it is not the kind of nod he was hoping for
OBRIEN
Oh no no no Youve got to be
able to fix me Please Susan tell
me you can make me normal again

SUSAN
Once the subject was polymerized we
were unable to reassemble the
original organic structure

His legs go wobbly

OBRIEN
Oh God please This cant be
happening I cant be plastic A
plastic man

SUSAN
Daniel

OBRIEN
Im a plastic man A plastic man

She slaps him his chin flaps back and forth before
snapping into place

SUSAN
We dont have time for hysterics

OBRIEN
We dont

SUSAN
What has happened to you is nothing
compared to what is going to happen
to Calumet City if we dont hurry

INT KITCHEN

She hands him a glass of water and drops several pills
into his open palm

OBRIEN
What are these

SUSAN
Mostly caffeine diuretics Help you
go to the bathroom

OBRIEN
Why

SUSAN
The nanobot is still inside you
Its programmed to exit through the
urinary tract We need it as soon
as possible so swallow those
He stares at the gleaming plastic capsules

OBRIEN
Pills you know how I feel about
pills

SUSAN

If you dont want to do it this way
I can remove it surgically

He gobbles them down

OBRIEN
Why do we need it

SUSAN
The nanobot is the only thing that

can stabilize the waste

OBRIEN
What waste

INT ARGON LABS - DAY

A BLAST of icy smoke COUGHS from the NOZZLE of a LIQUID
NITROGEN PACK

Two men in their heavy insulated space suits work over the
broken chamber where OBrien was polymerized dousing the

assembler waste with their liquid nitrogen hoses

The lab has become a winter wonderland

e lights have quit and the room is lit only by the green
and yellow fluoro-glow sticks worn on the helmets of the
workers

The assembler waste covered in frost bubbles and churns
lava-like and the two men FIRE another burst of FROZEN
GAS

FRANK TATER crosses to the door his boots CRUNCHING ON
the ICY FLOOR

INT HALL

Dr Nigel Nebbleman also wearing an insulated suit waits
for him

NEBBLEMAN
Well Frank

Frank lifts his helmet

FRANK
Ive never seen anything like it
We cant get a handle on it
INT BASEMENT LAB

It is in this poorly-lit basement that Dr Bright does
most of her work

SUSAN
To put is simply the nanobot inside
you is a microscopic machine encoded
with information like a strand of
messenger RNA that is programmed
to synthesize your molecules with
the polyisoprenes of the assembler
fluid rebuilding your entire
organic system on a molecular level

OBRIEN
That was simple

She sighs

SUSAN

The nanobot combined your molecules
with the plastic molecules in the
white assembler fluid so that ona
molecular level you now have more in
common with a Good Year tire than a
human being

OBRIEN
Got it

SUSAN
The problem is the by-product
created by the process

OBRIEN
The waste

As they talk we MOVE ALONG a stainless steel table where
Susan is conducting a series of tests with the waste

These tests reveal the stages of molecular deterioration
caused by the waste

SUSAN
Only part of the molecule from the
assembler fluid bonds to your
molecules The part left over is a
highly charged unstable molecule we
call a replicator

She puts on a pair of protective gloves and grabs one of
the test cylinders

SUSAN
The effect these replicators have on
any matter organic or inorganic is
similar to the molecular
deterioration caused by nuclear
radiation

The PRESSURIZED SEAL SIGHS open and she pours the contents
out

SUSAN
Ive been measuring the levels of
deterioration As with radiation
the more exposure the more damage
it does

A white egg rolls into her gloved palm

SUSAN
I dropped a single replicator in
with this egg two days ago

She hurls the egg at the ground and quite naturally at
this point it bounces back

He catches it It squishes between his fingers like a
racquetball He pulls at it It stretches like Silly-
Putty

OBRIEN
Its polymerized like me

She takes the egg back

SUSAN
The replicators start off like
assemblers but the replicators
never stabilize

OBRIEN
What happens

She opens another cylinder and pours it out And oval-
shaped wad of gray SLUDGE SPLATS onto the lid

OBRIEN
That was an egg

SUSAN
Three days ago it was

OBRIEN
What do these replicators do to
people

SUSAN
With enough exposure the same thing
they do to everything else
He swallows hard watching the egg-wad cling like snot
from the lid as she reseals the cylinder

EXT MAIN GATE - DAY
Spencer Lamm is on the scene which continues to escalate

SPENCER
Here in Calumet City a bomb has
just dropped Through anonymous
sources we have learned that Argon
Labs may have been the victim of an
attack by a radical environmentalist
group No such group has yet to
claim responsibility but we are
expecting confirmation of these
rumors at a press conference
scheduled this afternoon

INT LAB

Susan puts the cylinder of slime back into a large freezer
unit filled with similar cylinders

OBRIEN
So right now theres little
replicators spreading throughout
Argons lab

SUSAN
Thats right

OBRIEN
Isnt it already too late then

She shakes her head opening a final cylinder

SUSAN
There is a forty-eight hour period
during which the waste can be
stabilized

The contents slide into her hand

SUSAN
The nanobot will start a chain
reaction and transform the
replicators through a double
hydrogen bond creating an ionic
solid instead of a polymer

The egg seems fossilized half way to becoming the wad of
slime She hands it to OBrien It is as fragile as a

glass spider web

OBRIEN
Yet another miracle of modern
science

She ignores the sarcasm laced in that comment

SUSAN
I think while were waiting we had
better run some basic diagnostics on
you

OBRIEN
Youre the doctor

EXT SUSAN BRIGHTS BROWNSTONE - DAY

Across the street a dark Lincoln ominously glides to a
stop

INT SIMS LINCOLN

Sim settles back watching the building for any sign of
OBrien

SIM
Now we wait

Both he and Doby are licking ice cream cones For a
moment it is the only sound in the car

SIM
Darn good cone

INT BASEMENT

OBrien is sitting on a table his shirt off while Susan
listens to his lungs with a stethoscope

SUSAN
Breathe deep

The AIR RUSHES out

SUSAN
Lungs sound fine You didnt have
any pre-existing physical
conditions did you Allergies
Infections

OBRIEN
No why

She removes the stethoscope and grabs the light scope

SUSAN
My theory is that during the
polymerization the nanobot should
correct any malformed or defective
molecules Open

His mouth stretches impossibly wide for an amazing view of
the glands at the back of his throat

Looks fine

SUSAN
That theory is the reason Argon has
been pushing me to test the second
nanobot He believes its the only
thing that will save him

She picks up a hypodermic needle
SUSAN
Id like to run a few sample blood
tests to get an idea of how stable

your condition is

OBrien is beginning to bounce a bit the caffeine pumping
through his veins

OBRIEN
Okay Sure Youre the doc

Tearing open a needle package she inserts it into the
plastic hypo

SUSAN
Hold still

She fights to poke the needle through his resilient skin
When the sliver of metal pops through tiny Superball
bubbles of blood bounce into the cartridge like ping-pong

balls in a bingo machine

SUSAN
Amazing

She fills another cartridge when he begins to chatter his
rubbery teeth vibrating against each other

SUSAN
Is something wrong

OBRIEN
No no I just feel wired

His whole body begins to twitch and ripple

SUSAN
Its probably the caffeine

Suddenly he realizes he has to go to the bathroom
OBRIEN
Whoa Whoa I gotta go Right
now

She slips the needle out and he bolts off the table

SUSAN
Wait

She grabs a glass beaker as his hand shoots back and snags
it
INT BATHROOM

He bursts in fumbles with the beaker and his zipper then
lets it rip

OBRIEN
Ahhh

His eyes close as we hear him filling the beaker It is a
STRANGE SOUND more like a solid than a liquid

The sound bothers him and he looks down What he sees
terrifies him

INT BASEMENT LAB

Susan is looking into a microscope at the blood samples
when he comes tearing down the stairs

OBRIEN
Susan

SUSAN
What Whats wrong

He throws the beaker onto the table as if it were
contagious

OBRIEN
Look at this

SUSAN
What about it

He sticks a stirring rod into it and pulls it out The
contents are extremely viscous like rubber cement A
wispy strand dangles from the end of the stick

OBRIEN
Just look at it

SUSAN
The polymerization probably
synthesized into a kind of methyl-
cyanoacrylate So whats wrong
He looks as if he is about to cry

OBRIEN
Thats not biodegradable

She cant stop herself from laughing

OBRIEN
Oh yeah real funny Yuk-yuk
Lets laugh at everything a man
believes in

SUSAN
Im sorry Daniel but you have to
admit its pretty ironic that you of
all people would be the first man
ever polymerized Its got to mean
something

OBRIEN
Means Oh no We wont know what it
means until the end of the story and
maybe then it wont seem quite as
funny to you Doctor Frankenstein

The smile disappears

SUSAN
Whats that supposed to mean

OBRIEN
Just giving credit where credit is
due

SUSAN
You have no one to blame but
yourself

OBRIEN
Blame the victim

SUSAN

Victim my ass You stole my
security key and used it to break
into my lab to do who knows what
kind of damage Maybe this is the
end of the story and you finally got
what you deserved

OBRIEN
This is what I deserve for trying to
protect the world from a madman and
his mercenary physicists

SUSAN
Youre not protecting the world
youre obstructing progress

OBRIEN
I dont consider uncontrollable
toxic waste progress

SUSAN
And Im sure you thought Columbus
was going to sail off the edge of
the world

OBRIEN
But lo and behold he found another
world that progress could

annihilate

SUSAN
Come on I dont see you living ina
cave

OBRIEN
And I dont see you sunbathing at
Chernobyl

She stops first smiling caught by an odd sense of deja
vu He smiles feeling the same thing

SUSAN
Just like old times
OBRIEN
Yeah Old times
There is an awkward silence
OBRIEN

I want you to know that I really
appreciate you helping me

SUSAN
Im glad you came to me for help

They arent sure what to do
OBRIEN

I feel very emotional right now A
bit out of control

SUSAN
Probably the caffeine

OBRIEN
Do you have something to bring me
down

SUSAN

No problem
INT ARGONS OFFICE

JOHN JOPLIN high-ranking EPA official listens as Dr
Nebbleman tries to explain what has happened

Argon and Poppy are also in the office

NEBBLEMAN
The nanobot is a molecular machine
It uses the assembler fluid to
polymerize a whole system of carbon-
based molecules as in say a human
body

His eyes shift nervously to Argon who nods encouragingly

NEBBLEMAN
Once its complete the waste from
the assembler fluid is left
destabilized with groups of highly
charged attractors capable of
bonding to any carbon molecule
exposed for a long enough period

JOPLIN
Hold on son Are you saying that
they can bond to people

NEBBLEMAN
With enough exposure it appears
they can bond to anything

JOPLIN
Well what will they do to people

Nebbleman glances nervously at Argon

NEBBLEMAN
Well at this time I mean that is
to say it is difficult to
project --

ARGON

Look John nobody wants to find out
what happens Thats why youre
here We need your help on this one
and thats why that suitcase is
here

Poppy opens it for him The root of all evil Stacks and
stacks of it

JOPLIN
Let me assure you Dr Argon the
EPA is as always on your side
INT SUSANS LIVING ROOM

It is later

OBrien is stretched out on the sofa in a valium fugue
his long supple limbs conform to the curves of the

cushions dangling over all sides

His head is on the floor neck distending down from the
arm rest

Mid-snore he wakes up yawning
From his upside down view he sees the refrigerator

OBrien opens the fridge

Rubber-necking he looks inside while his body lies on the

INT BASEMENT LAB
She is still glued to the microscope

SUSAN
Damn it

She pounds her fist against the lab table

OBRIEN (0S)
Uh oh I remember that temper

SUSAN
Daniel I didnt hear you come
down

She turns and finds his head almost floating perched on
his neck arching erectly up the stairs

OBRIEN
Whats wrong
SUSAN
The nanobot its not here

OBRIEN
Its still inside me

She nods watching his head bobbing cobra-like around her
SUSAN
Youll have to start drinking

How far can you stretch

OBRIEN
I dont know

EXT SUSANS BACKYARD - DAY

Standing in the square of rich green grass OBrien looks
up

He lifts his head and takes a deep breath staring at his
fingers spread against the blue expanse above him

SUSAN
Go ahead Reach as high as you can

From ABOVE his hand we see OBrien nod nervously and
begin to reach --

His face Dr Bright the square lawn the house one by
one seem to FALL AWAY --

Spreading out under the hand until the ground seems like
the sky did moments ago

INT SIMS LINCOLN

Sim and Doby lean into the front windshield of the black
Lincoln watching OBriens arm telescope into the sky

SIM
Thats why I love the security biz
Just when you think youve seen
everything
He whips out his cellular Dials

EXT SUSANS BACKYARD

Dr Bright stares open-mouthed at the arm-ribbon as it
rises impossibly like a kite
She turns and sees OBriens body thinning almost
spooling out like a ball of yarn until his pants fall down
to his ankles

He feels the draft and turns to see her looking at him

OBRIEN
Oops

He grabs his pants as his arm returns with a RUSHING sound
that ends with a loud rubbery CLAP

OBRIEN
Ill end up back in jail for
indecent exposure

Dr Bright nods vaguely already lost in thought

OBRIEN
What

She reaches out and feels his hair
INT BASEMENT LAB
A scalpel saws through several strands of OBriens hair

SUSAN
That should do it

His hair is shorter and she drops the strands with the
rest of it into a Ziploc bag

SUSAN
Im going to go out for a while I
want to take the blood samples to a
lab that has the equipment I need

OBRIEN
What did you want my hair for

SUSAN
Something else I want to try

She puts the Ziploc bag in her briefcase and gets the
blood samples

OBRIEN
I could go with you

SUSAN
I think it would be better for me to
go alone Im sure Sim is looking
for you Just sit tight Ill bring
you back a pizza
OBRIEN
No cheese

SUSAN
I was hoping you were over that
Remember to keep drinking fluids

INT LIMO

Poppy Argon and John Joplin are inside as it pulls up
outside Cook County courthouse

POPPY
How do I look

She is dressed in a two-piece PVC business suit smart yet
slutty Argon smiles

ARGON
Positively paradoxical

INT SUSANS LIVING ROOM

OBrien is stretched out on the couch watching The Itchy
and Scratchy Show on the television

He is drinking a two liter bottle of Coke without
stopping His Adams apple bobs like a cartoon as he

swallows

We can hear the COKE FIZZING in his distending stomach
It swells like a water balloon

Finishing the bottle he tosses it into a garbage bag
filled with empties

He lets out a super hero style belch then settles back
chuckling at the cartoon

Itchy gets a frying pan to the face

On the table there is a vase filled with dried flowers
He empties it and with the vase walks over to the hall
mirror

Slowly he forces the vase over his head

When he yanks it off his head keeps the shape He starts
to laugh and his face pops back

There is a series of GURGLING sounds from his STOMACH as
he realizes he has to go

He bolts for the bathroom his hand whipping out for the
beaker

SAME - BIT LATER
Hes finished and he sets the beaker back where it was
He thinks and mumbles

OBRIEN
Technically I dont even have to
go to the bathroom

We MOVE CLOSER and CLOSER to the beaker THROUGH the glass
INTO the golden fluid --

SHRINKING as we MOVE THROUGH the murk DOWN TO the
MOLECULAR LEVEL where we SQUEEZE BETWEEN chains of
elastomers --

And FIND the nanobot
INT COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE

The press room is small considering the sizable horde
that is packed wall to wall shoulder to shoulder to see
CEO Poppy Argon and the EPA deliver their statements

The WHITE NOISE of press CHATTER reaches a fevered pitch
as the county sheriff leads Poppy Argon and several EPA
officials in

John Joplin steps to the podium and the crowd noise dies

He leans into the bouquet of microphones opening his
statement

JOPLIN
Good afternoon The intent of

A MAN shouts from the crowd

MAN
Who are you

JOPLIN
Oh Im John Joplin special
investigator for the EPA The
intent of this press conference is
twofold Number one to affirm that
there has been a slight chemical
spill at Argon Labs Cleanup is
already under way

FLASHBULBS BURST

JOPLIN
And number two that the EPA in
conjunction with members of Illinois
County Sheriff Department and the
FBI have concluded that the spill
was not accidental
The press begins to titter and Joplin raises his voice

JOPLIN
Last night Argon Labs was the
target of what can only be described
as a terrorist act

Another barrage of flashes

JOPLIN
The single assailant sabotaged
certain chemical storage units
creating the toxic spill

MAN
Are there any suspects

JOPLIN
The only thing I can say is that the
perpetrator was photographed by
Argon Security cameras The rest of
the details of the case until a
later time will be kept in the
highest confidentiality Thank you

The press erupts Who was it Was it a group Have you
identified him

Joplins eyebrows go up and he turns back to the podium

JOPLIN
Oh yeah His names Daniel
OBrien

The entourage begins to file out under a barrage of
questions Spencer Lamm fights to get his crew in front
of Poppy

SPENCER
Mrs Argon do you have anything to
say to this OBrien character

Poppy looks at the mic several others surrounding it

POPPY
All I can say is that when these
radicals act outside the law
recklessly endangering the
environment and human lives it
clearly demonstrates that they are
the menace and we are the victims

INT SUSANS LIVING ROOM

The TELEVISION is ON though MUTED
We hear OBRIEN GRUNTING and the sound of sweaty RUBBER
RUBBING AGAINST RUBBER

The door opens and Susan enters a pizza box in one hand
briefcase in the other

SUSAN
Daniel

As she enters she notices something is different about
the furniture There is a second flesh-colored love
seat

OBriens head suddenly pops up

OBRIEN
Surprise

His head rises from the top of the back

SUSAN
Thats pretty good

OBRIEN
Getting used to it

He starts to get up becoming human the round padded seat
swelling into buttocks when he realizes he is naked

OBRIEN
Whoa
He pops back to a chair
SUSAN
Dont worry I got just what you

need

A leg of the chair shoots out as he grabs his underwear
from the pile of clothes

Susan sets the pizza down and opens her briefcase

SUSAN
I have a friend at a textile lab
She helped me

The OBrien chair pulls the underwear up over the front
two legs covering the cushion as he stands changing back
to normal

SUSAN
Ta-da

She holds up a tiny red suit that looks big enough for a
GI Joe doll
OBRIEN
Whats that

SUSAN
Its a crime fighting costume what
do you think Its underwear so if
you lose your clothes youll still
be decent

OBRIEN
Thats going to fit me

SUSAN
Like a glove

He pulls at it It stretches easily

OBRIEN
You made this out of my hair

SUSAN
Sort of We used a process similar
to the vulcanization of rubber and
added bulk with a chain of
chloroprene elastomers
He shakes his head

OBRIEN
I bet you still kill at Scrabble

She smiles

SUSAN
Go on try it on Oh wait

She reaches back into her bag

SUSAN
There was some extra so I made
these
In her palm are two little red boots
OBRIEN

Cute

As he crosses to the bathroom we see the television is
again updating the crisis at Argon Labs

SUSAN
Did you go

OBRIEN
On the counter

She grabs the sample heading immediately for the
basement when the television catches her eye

OBrien crams one foot in and then the other The
material stretches miraculously

OBRIEN

INT SUSANS LIVING ROOM
OBrien bounds out of the bathroom
OBRIEN

‘In brightest day nor darkest
night No evil shall escape my
sight

Susan is silent in front of the TV the sound now ON She
is still holding the beaker

OBRIEN
What is it

He moves around her and sees his own face on the screen
It is the black and white photo of him about to sneeze

At the bottom of the screen is the title Voice of Dr
Warren Wertham

DR WERTHAM (VO)
an extremely volatile individual
given to emotional outbursts

OBRIEN
Wertham Thats no good

SUSAN
Who is he

OBRIEN
The head shrinker at the prison

DR WERTHAM (VO)
paranoid delusions and prone to
hero fantasies all of which are
characteristic of a form of
infantile dementia

OBRIEN
Ha What a crock He couldnt be

more wrong could he

She says nothing
OBRIEN
I said could he

The sneeze picture shrinks to an insert over the anchor
woman Tawney Towers shoulder

TAWNEY (VO)
Once again at this time
authorities continue their statewide
manhunt for the man believed
responsible for the situation
developing at Argon Labs As
reports come in News Center 5 will
continue to update you

Susan cuts it OFF

SUSAN
Oh no Theyre trying to blame you
for the accident That means they
must not have been able to control
the replicators

OBRIEN
I cant go back to jail I gotta
get out of here

SUSAN
Youre not going back to jail All
we need to do is find the nanobot
Once the meltdown is under control
then we deal with Argon --

Suddenly the front door explodes open the jamb easily
splintering under Dobys girth

Doby and Sim barrel in pistols pointing

SUSAN
What in the hell

SIM
Pipe down brain lady And you

The gun sweeps toward OBrien

SIM
Id curb that monkey business
lessin you want to find out if that
rubber skin of yours is bulletproof
Now keep your hands where I can see
them

He notices the urine sample

SIM
Whats that
Susan doesnt miss a beat

SUSAN
Lemonade Do you want some

She offers him the beaker Sim considers it

SIM
No thanks

Back to business

SIM
Put it down and lets go Someone
wants to talk to you

He waves them out the front door as she sets the beaker on
the counter

The black LIMO FIRES UP as the foursome approach Sim
opens the back door for OBrien and Dr Bright

SIM
Get in

INT LIMO

In the artificial coolness Daniel OBrien sits with
Icarus Argon across from Poppy Susan and Dr Nebbleman
In the rear window we see Sims Lincoln follow

Poppy brandishes a chrome revolver from her handbag

Argon smiles in the shady light makeup covering the more
abrasive features of his spotty skin

ARGON
My apologies to you both for the
rather rude invitation but I had to
see you And Dr Bright your
house isnt

He motions to his blanket-draped legs

ARGON
Wheelchair accessible

SUSAN
Dr Argon I demand an explanation

OBRIEN
I can explain it Attempted murder
wasnt enough for him He wants to
add kidnapping to the charges
ARGON
If youd like we can go straight to
the authorities I understand they
are very interested in talking to
you

OBriens only response is to grind his teeth in silence

ARGON
We havent been properly introduced
Mr OBrien I am Icarus Argon

He offers his hand taking OBriens

He closes his eyes beginning to caress OBriens hand
between the withered brown flesh of his own

ARGON
Do you know how I made my first
fortune Poly vinyl chloride
PVC It was almost thirty years
ago when I first held a credit card
in my hands There was something
about the way it felt I told
myself paper was doomed This was
the future

He looks at OBriens hand lets go

ARGON
plastic

OBRIEN
Wow that is one moving story Take
it easy on my heart strings Now I
really feel guilty complaining about
you shooting me up with your poison

ARGON
Poison Im surprised at you You
lack vision Mr OBrien

OBRIEN
Youre lacking a few things too
ethics morals common decency and
oh yeah deodorant

Argon smiles His coolness irritates OBrien

ARGON
Look at me Mr OBrien I once
competed for Mr Universe but now I
am reduced to this a withered
shell A prison of rot

He leans into OBrien
ARGON
People ask me what I did to myself
I answer what didnt I do I
treat me body like I treat the rest
of the world as a force to be
controlled Most people believe
there is something sacred about the
human body about nature They are
the same fools who thought the
world was flat

OBrien smirks

ARGON

The body is just another part of
nature and ever since we gave up
trees for central air there has
been nothing sacred about nature
Nature is the enemy Mr OBrien
and science is our greatest weapon
against her

OBRIEN
You egomaniacs make me laugh
Natures going to bury you like she
buries everyone else

Argon laughs

ARGON
Not anymore Mr OBrien The
nanobot has changed that

SUSAN
If you think I would ever give you
the nanobot after this you are
deluding yourself

ARGON
You dont have to give it to us
because Dr Nebbleman can just cut
it out of him

OBRIEN
Ha Morons Its not even in me
anymore
Everyone reacts
ARGON

What

Before OBrien can say anything else Susan slaps her hand
over his mouth

NEBBLEMAN
She could have given him something
to stimulate his kidneys

ARGON
Dr Nebbleman take care of them

Argon grabs the car phone while Nebbleman removes a loaded
syringe from a black case

ARGON
Mr Sim I want you to return to Dr
Brights I believe she is hiding
something of ours there

SUSAN
No

We see the Lincoln turn off the highway

SUSAN
Daniel do something

With eye blurring speed OBriens arm rockets out as he
grabs for the needle Nebbleman screams as OBriens hand
molds over his own

Poppy wheels on OBrien as Nebbleman falls screaming
wrestling against his own hand

Before she can raise the gun Dr Bright lunges grappling
for control

The GUN FIRES wildly

ARGON
No

The BULLET RICOCHETS around the cabin before embedding in
the seat cushion in between Nebblemans legs

OBrien pushes the hypo plunger down squirting the
sedative in Nebblemans face Nebbleman screams

SUSAN
Daniel go Ill be all right Get
the nanobot

He nods yanking the door handles but they are locked
He glances quickly around the limo then dives at the rear
seat body thinning flattening into the crack where the

seat meets the back --

Leaving Poppy clinging to his empty clothes as he
disappears from the cabin

Nebbleman can hardly catch his breath
NEBBLEMAN
Where did he go

As soon as the words pass Argons reptilian lips there is
a CLICK and the TRUNK opens behind them

OBrien stands and the limo begins to zig-zag hard on the
open expressway

Argon smiles through the small rear window as OBrien
tries to keep his balance

OBrien throws an arm at a passing truck going in the
opposite direction seizing hold of it --

Slinging himself like a rubber band --

Into the air tucking his knees to his chest bracing
himself He becomes --

A red comet that crashes into an oncoming Cadillac caving
in its hood and rebounding into the air soaring over a row

Of course sir

SUSAN
Dr Argon I know you want to use
the nanobot on yourself but you
mustnt The situation is critical
right now The replicators are
growing exponentially If we wait
much longer it will be too late
You have to use the nanobot to stop
the meltdown

ARGON
Dr Bright I dont have to do
anything

SUSAN

But in another twenty-four hours the
core meltdown will be beyond the
stabilization period There will be
no way to stop it

ARGON
To be brutally honest with you
Susan as long as the nanobot does
to me what it did to that idiot
OBrien I dont give a rats ass
about what happens after that
The sincerity of his smile unnerves her

SUSAN
You cant mean that

Come with me Susan I want to show
you something

INT ARGONS OFFICE
The elevators open and Poppy Argon and Susan get out

ARGON
Something to drink Dr Bright

SUSAN
No thank you

parched Poppy

prefer the future Come

INT CONSERVATORY
The moist air envelops them as they enter

ARGON
This is my garden Few people have
seen it because it means so much to
me I am hoping as a fellow
scientist you can appreciate it

It is a botanical nightmare Huge sealed tanks feature
bizarre plant-life bred and genetically engineered
indiscriminately like a blind man pairing a sock drawer

Susan moves onto the yellow brick lane a look of horror
wrinkling her face

ARGON
Gardener

A man in a green jump suit looks up This is the
GARDENER He is never without his red sprayer tank slung
over his shoulder and is always wearing an old snouted gas
mask
ARGON
Would you excuse us

He disappears as the three start down the path

ARGON
Every species every organism is the
only one of its kind created
through cross-breeding or chemical
and radioactive mutation as well as
genetic manipulation

Inside atmospherically controlled tanks life exists where
it should not Translucent palmy ferns bask beneath a
deadly drizzle of acid rain Crystalline cacti flourish
around the soft glow of a radioactive isotope

ARGON
I spend more time here than anywhere
else nurturing them treating them
because they all require very
special care

He gazes into a sealed geranium at a single flower with
petals the color of a dead fish It is being fed drops of
photophorescent paste from tubes that hang like IVs

ARGON
Poppy calls them my children and I
suppose thats how I feel That I
have given birth to all of them and
there is nothing as precious or as
beautiful as ones own children

Poppy smiles at him as they stop in front of a tank where
seamonkey-like creatures titter and play inside their
toxic solarium

ARGON
We will always love most that which
we create Dont you agree Susan

SUSAN
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the
atomic bomb

She cant believe that she just used an OBrien line
ARGON
More than he would ever admit His
child changed the world What could
make a parent more proud than that

The door closes behind them and the car eases into the

FROM UNDER the car we see the feet of Sim and Doby sweep
by then disappear as the two men enter the lobby of Argon
Tower

OBrien drops to the ground from the Lincolns drive shaft
letting out a string of whispered expletives

INT CONSERVATORY
Argon slurps from the Coca-Cola watching Susan

ARGON
I brought you up here Dr Bright
because I want you to understand
that we are on the path The only
difference is that you are walking
with your head down afraid to look
up to see where the path is going

SUSAN
I suppose you are going to tell me
where it is going

ARGON
I ask you what is the purpose of
science What is the point of all
our relentless exploration
investigation and experimentation
It is to understand a single
physical phenomenon or to
understand them all To cure one
disease or to cure every disease
If science is simply a means what
then is the end

His WHEELCHAIR CLICKS and HUMS toward her

ARGON
Look up Look above you Susan and
tell me what you see

She looks up through the glass roof of the conservatory at
the soot-stained sky

SUSAN
Pollution

ARGON
Do you know what I see I see man
making his own clouds I see man
coloring his own sky and like this
garden it is a site that makes my
heart sing
He licks his lips

ARGON
This is our world Susan and once
you realize that you will
understand that the only place our
path can end is on the throne of
heaven Science is the quest for
divine perfection

SUSAN
How do you know were not heading in
the wrong direction

ARGON
I look behind us I look to the
past to a world steeped in rot and
decay I think of the Acropolis in
another century reduced to little
more than dust I see the faces of
Rushmore eventually losing all
distinction and then I look at
this

He cradles the plastic bottle of Coca-Cola

ARGON
And I imagine it in a thousand years
as perfectly shaped as the day it
was made

He smiles at her

ARGON
I find that thought exceptionally
reassuring

Nebbleman burst through the glass doors

NEBBLEMAN
Theyre here Theyre here We
have the nanobot

ARGON
Excellent How long until the
assembler tank is complete

Nebblemans glasses steam up from the humidity as he
stumbles toward them

NEBBLEMAN
Dr Makeo is working on it now sir
I estimate at least another six
hours
ARGON
In the meantime why dont you find
something useful for Dr Bright to
do

SUSAN
I swear to you Argon if you dont
stop the meltdown that nanobot will
be the last one I ever build

ARGON
Susan I sense you are having
difficulty understanding the
situation you are presently in I
ask that you keep in mind that I am
ready to reduce an entire city to
gelatin to get what I want

Susan notices the guards posted at the door
ARGON
If I were you Id be careful about
making promises that you will be
unable to keep
His smile is as subtle as a knife point

OBrien sneaks ever so silently edging toward the door at
the opposite end

The walls are covered with an impressive collection by
artists like Dali Picasso and Bacon picture-lit

dramatically

As he nears the end he suddenly hears voices moving
toward him He jumps back searching for a place to hide

Two armed GUARDS enter

Who are we supposed to be looking
for

They do not notice the bizarre red portrait hanging on the

A guard is posted outside Susans room
INT SUSANS ROOM

Scientific equipment is piled in a room that looks like a
guest bedroom

Awkwardly filling the center of the room is a long
industrial freezer unit

Nebbleman and Susan are alone

NEBBLEMAN
These samples were taken from the
surrounding area All the pertinent
information is on disk

Nebbleman lifts the lid cold air puffing out spilling
over the freezers edge

NEBBLEMAN
What we need to know is expansion
rates how soon the replicators will
reach the edge of the compound

Inside there are several normal-looking objects taken from
the lab including a metal stool a microscope and several
glass beakers

She stares at him numbly

SUSAN
I dont believe this is happening

NEBBLEMAN
Susan Dr Argon is giving you an
opportunity here

SUSAN
Opportunity

That snaps her up

SUSAN
Theres a guard outside my door
Im a prisoner Nigel Do you
understand that

NEBBLEMAN
Dr Argon would say we are all
prisoners

SUSAN

Argon is a lunatic I cant believe
I was stupid enough to believe I
could control him You heard what
he said Nigel He doesnt care if
all of Calumet City is turned to
Jell-O How can that not affect

you

NEBBLEMAN
Because I am a new man Susan I am
aman of vision Your problem

Susan is that youre always looking
down If youd just look up youd
see the big picture and in the big
picture men of vision do not dwell
on what might be lost They focus
on what can be gained

SUSAN
Is that what Argon told you

NEBBLEMAN
No Well not those exact words

SUSAN

hears --

Hey you

The security man is a hundred feet away but before he can
even get his gun out --

OBriens arm shoots down the hall a huge hand
reaching --
Covering the security mans entire head before he is able
to scream

The hand is like a plastic bag over his head that he cant
get free of until he finally blacks out

OBrien lays him down gently His arm snaps back and he
tip-toes away

INT SUSANS ROOM
Nebbleman smirks cleaning his glasses

NEBBLEMAN
Im not interested in being a hero
Susan Im not interested in self-
delusion and romantic sentiment

He puts his glasses back on

NEBBLEMAN
Im a scientist I have lived my
whole life by the diagnostic
application of fact and the fact is
Argon is going to get whatever he
wants so if I were you Id give it
to him

SUSAN
You mean the designs for the
nanobot You think after this Im
going to give them to him

NEBBLEMAN
I think that either youre going to
give them to him or hes going to
make you give them to him

SUSAN
Make me How You think hes going

to torture me

Nebbleman shrugs

NEBBLEMAN
I would
He smiles and that makes it worse
SUSAN
Get out Get out now before I hurt

you
Nebbleman stammers before scurrying for the door

INT HALL
OBrien is searching different rooms stuffing his head
between door and jamb calling Susan in a hushed
voice

The elevator at the end of the hall opens and he hears the
ELECTRIC WHINE of Argons WHEELCHAIR together with the TAP
of Poppys STILETTO HEELS

He presses himself flat against the nearest door

POPPY
Do you think she will give us the
designs

ARGON

Eventually These things are always
a matter of leverage

POPPY
And you think OBrien is that
leverage

ARGON

That remains to be seen

OBrien peeks out and sees that they are heading straight
at him

POPPY
And you still believe hes going to
come here

ARGON
Based on what we know of him that

would seem inevitable

POPPY
Do you think she loves him

ARGON
She must feel something for him
After all she and I did create him

It seems they are about to see him but when they reach the
double doors OBrien is gone

She throws open the door and he follows her into --

INT POPPYS BEDROOM

Everything is red PVC gleaming like patent leather
POPPY

Do you think she loves him like I
love you
It is a womans question and it annoys him

ARGON
Poppy are you in one of your moods
again

POPPY

No Icky this is real
She closes the doors behind them

POPPY
Ive been thinking a lot since this
all started Thinking about us

Uninterested in the direction of the conversation Argon
notices that there are two identical ottomans

POPPY
You know how I feel about you You
know how much I need you How much
I trust you I would do anything
for you

ARGON
Why are there two ottomans

POPPY
Icarus please This is important

She sees him staring at the ottoman and steps up onto it
heels gouging into the padding

The OTTOMAN GURGLES

POPPY
Look at me Icarus Look at my
body Ive done everything changed
anything you asked me to ‘We will
always love most that which we
create Is that still true

ARGON
Yes Yes of course it is

POPPY
Then you still love me

ARGON
Poppy please just tell me what you
want

She steps down and kneels close to the wheelchair
POPPY

I want to know what will happen if
the nanobot works on you become like
OBrien a plastic man What will
happen to me

He realizes what she is asking

ARGON
You want to be polymerized

Timidly she looks up into his eyes

POPPY
Plastic means forever doesnt it

His smile is like a razor-cut lips slowly widening
ARGON
That it does my dear That it
does

She smiles until he pulls away and begins wheeling out

POPPY
Icarus

ARGON
I promise my dear I will give the
matter some consideration

POPPY
Consideration

ARGON
If you honestly trust me then
youll have to trust me
He closes the door
Angry she turns away looking for something to hit She
picks up a hairbrush instead and begins violently brushing

her hair in the vanity mirror

Behind her in the mirror we see the ottoman scurry
mouse-like to the closest door

INT BATHROOM

OBrien stands up in agony holding his back where her
heels dug in

A CLATTERING noise draws him to the door He peeks out
just as she pulls down the zipper on her dress

Shrugging out of the sleeves she walks toward the
bathroom

OBrien searches the room where the bedroom was red the
bathroom is completely white
There is nowhere to hide except --

The toilet He climbs in as the door opens She drops

As she moves to the tub OBriens hand reaches up and
pulls the flush

She hears the TOILET FLUSH looks at it wiggles the
handle

INT SUSANS ROOM

Susan is moving around the room thinking

In her gloved hands is the glass beaker which she is
wringing nervously wadding crinkling and pulling at it

so intensely it sounds like popping bubble wrap

She looks at the windows and at the black steel bars
outside

We RISE ABOVE her MOVING TOWARD the chandelier TOWARD
the single light bulb that is apparently burned out

Until we can SEE INTO the grayish glass and FIND the tip
of the fiber optic cable

OBrien zips through the intersecting elbowing maze of
pipes

INT BATHROOM
Another toilet seat peeks open The room is empty
OBrien climbs out

He grabs a towel drying himself as he quietly cracks open

the door
When he sees Susan at the desk he cant believe his luck
OBRIEN
Susan
She nearly jumps out of her skin
SUSAN
Daniel
They rush to each others arms
SUSAN

I dont believe it Youre here
Oh thank God

OBRIEN
You didnt think I could just leave
you

SUSAN

I didnt know what was going to
happen I was just so worried
something was going to happen to
you

OBRIEN
What could happen Im the plastic
man remember

She remembers Argon

SUSAN
Oh no Argon We have to stop him
before he uses the nanobot We have
to get the nanobot

OBRIEN
Where is it

SUSAN
Argons private lab

OBRIEN

Lets go
They start for the door when Susan whispers

SUSAN
Wait Theres a guard
OBrien almost laughs

OBRIEN
Hell never know what hit him

He grabs the handle and throws open the door

Susan cant see what he sees but she knows by his
reaction its not good

SIM
Savior-faire is everywhere

OBrien backs up into the room pushed by a very large
gun

SIM
I am Mr Ubiquitous aint I
OBrien

Doby enters behind Sim with several heavily-armed guards

SIM
You know what ubiquitous means
dont you It means here we go
again

Sim laughs very loudly as Argon wheels in Poppy at his
side

ARGON
Welcome to my home Mr OBrien As
you can see weve been expecting
you

Sim laughs again

OBRIEN
This is wonderfully accommodating of
you all Now I wont have to come
looking for you

SIM
You were looking for us

OBRIEN
Yeah I have something Ive been
meaning to give you

SIM
Yeah and what might that be

OBRIEN
An ass-beating Would you like

yours first Mr Sim

Sim cocks his gun and now OBrien smiles
SIM
Just try it Come on Do
something Move Anything
Anything Just twitch blink I
dare you I double dare you

OBrien becomes completely rigid frozen like a smiling
mannequin

Sim doesnt know what to do He looks around the room
when --

OBriens tongue lashes out like a frogs and snatches
the gun

SIM
Thats disgusting

OBrien levels the gun at Argon and everyone reacts

OBRIEN
I should kill you right now for what
you did to me

ARGON
Maybe you should but you cant

Susan screams as Doby grabs her and pins a gun to her
head

SUSAN
Run Daniel Get out of here

OBRIEN
Im not leaving without you Susan

ARGON
You dont have to leave Mr
OBrien Weve prepared a wonderful
room for you I think youll find
it quite comfortable so
comfortable in fact I doubt youll
ever want to leave

As he speaks they all pull out white oxygen masks

ARGON
Gardener

The Gardener appears sprayer in hand and rushes straight
at OBrien aiming the nozzle into his face

OBrien tries to back away to find air but the nozzle is
everywhere pumping a mist that envelops both of them

Coughing choking unable to breathe the gas begins to
take effect OBrien collapses the gas-masked figure
standing over the soft rubbery head

SUSAN
Nooo

Poppy and Argon exchange quiet smiles

SUSAN
What are you going to do to him

ARGON
Do Well I suppose that depends on
you

She knows what he wants and her head drops
INT CONSERVATORY

The Gardener adjusts several gas tank valves and we FOLLOW
the feed lines UP TO the top where the humidifier blower
breathes into the sealed cell

The gasses drift down to the bottom where we see the
supple red puddle of OBrien

Floating on the edge of consciousness OBrien lifts his
head Outside the curved Plexiglas he sees warped faces
staring at him

OBRIEN
Susa

His eyes roll and his head pitches forward slapping and
flattening out against the plexi

Dr Bright touches the glass

SUSAN
What did you use

ARGON
A light mixture of oxygen dioxide
and sodium pentothal Hell sleep
thats all

She takes a last look at him then steadies herself as she
turns to Argon

SUSAN
I give you the design you let us
both go Thats the deal

Argon nods

Susan is at the desk her jaw set her face blank ina
kind of analytical trance

Then throws open the freezer unit
INT CONSERVATORY

In a drugged haze OBrien searches the edges of his
prison

His head and limbs move with a strange fluidity rising
and falling like the molten blebs of a lava lamp

His fingers find the gas line opening in the blower

Taking a deep breath he sticks his arm into the tiny hole
and pulls himself up inside

We FOLLOW the coils of copper tubing DOWN INTO the
different tanks of gas

We hear the TINK TINK as he pounds against the metal
canisters

Unable to hold his breath he rises through the gas-feeds
back to the opening where he emerges like a giant red
droplet of water --

Falling and splashing back into his cell

ARGON
Can you feel it Poppy The
presence of the moment Can you
feel the weight of its significance

POPPY
Oh yes Icky I can feel it

ARGON
This is what my entire life has been
directed at this moment this
threshold

POPPY
Okay arms up lean forward

He leans over her shoulder and she holds him up while she
takes his pants off

ARGON
I stand on the verge of mans
greatest triumph over the forces of
nature

Pants down she sets him back into the chair

ARGON
Gently gently My metamorphosis
will be more than a simple
transformation

She pulls his feet free of each pant leg

ARGON
It will be an ascension

POPPY
Im so excited Icarus

She stands helping him with his robe

POPPY
I was wondering if youd finished
considering

ARGON
Considering what

POPPY

What I asked you earlier
He realizes what she is talking about

ARGON
Poppy please --

Dr Makeo enters

He shoves at the door but it doesnt budge

INT SUSANS ROOM

We hear DOBY SLAM against the door but it holds Across
the dark room we see Susan standing at the window

SUSAN
Come on come on

She is holding the glass beaker against the iron bars
infecting them with the replicator fallout

Body batters the door again

She drops the beaker and grabs hold of the two bars They
bend like thick rods of rubber

SUSAN
Yes

The next blow vibrates through the entire frame

Ignoring it she grabs hold of the stool that was also
taken from the lab

Stretching out one of the legs she ties it to one of the
non-polymerized bars

The DOOR SPLINTERS at the hinge

Hurrying she squeezes herself and the stool out between
the rubber bars

Standing on the ledge she makes a crucial mistake she
looks down

The roof of the main laboratory is forty feet away

EXT MAIN GATE

Chatting with the other reporters Spencer looks up and
sees Dr Bright standing outside the window

Holy shit Jumper
He grabs his cameraman

SPENCER

INT SUSANS ROOM
The DOOR SHRIEKS cracking open
Out on the edge Susan closes her eyes
SUSAN
Itll work Its got to Its got

to

Holding tightly to one of the other legs of the stool she
takes a deep breathe and --

Steps off the ledge

She falls the stool stretching surreally but it is not
pliable enough to reach the roof below

Halfway down it slows about to bungee-bouce her back up
Her body jerks as the leg wrenches from her grip --
Sending her cartwheeling into the open air

She seems to hang for a moment watching the stool
shrinking back to the window

She screams

EXT MAIN GATE

Every camera is locked on her
EXT ROOF

There is nothing between her and the roof except the force
of gravity It sucks her down

Plummeting helplessly hurtling she screams again as --

She slams onto the roof but instead of being splattered
against it --

She bounces up

The polymerized roof gives like a trampoline tossing her
lightly until she lays on her back staring up at the
window adrenaline bubbling out of her in laughter and
tears

Outside he sees Susan climbing down through a roof access
door into the quarantined lab

Oh shit Wheres Argon

Argon sits in his wheelchair eyes blazing as Nebbleman
draws the nanobiotic fluid into a hypodermic needle

NEBBLEMAN
Of course you understand Dr Argon
that once the nanobot is inside of
you there is no going back --

ARGON
Shut up and do it

Nebbleman forces down a swallow and sticks the needle
into his neck

INT MAIN LAB

Susan moves through the unreal reality of the polymerized
building

Her feet sink with every step into the floor
Door handles bend like kneaded dough

The concrete formed steps in the stairwell pillow out
under her weight and she loses her balance --

Groping for the rail that also distends

SUSAN
This is insane

INT ARGONS PRIVATE LAB

Argon sheds his robe and wearing black bikini briefs he
starts to climb into the tank

Makeo tries to help him
ARGON
No Ill do it myself

His legs withered and atrophied like sticks of beef
jerky drag behind him With obvious effort he pulls
himself into the chamber

Wheezing he can only nod to Dr Makeo who closes and
seals the chamber

Dr Makeo cranks the pressurized balloon valves watching
the gauges as the chemicals begin to flow from the mixing
vats into the main chamber

There is a MUFFLED SCREAM as the chamber begins to fill
KNOCKING and shaking slightly

Several nervous glances are exchanged as the gauges begin
to climb

of a strange serrated shaft

OBrien has formed his arm into a massive tire jack which
spans the walls of his transparent cage

His other arm works the lever with slow determination
ratcheting up the shaft

Outside the tank the polyethylene window begins to bulge
where his hand presses

OBrien glares beneath his heavy eyelids

OBRIEN
Come on OBrien --

INT MAIN LAB

Susan sneaks out of the stairwell Down the hall she
sees two members of the containment crew in their heavy
protective suits Each has a tank strapped to their back

and is hosing the entire hall with liquid nitrogen

They do not notice her as she heads the other way trying
not to let the floor squeak

Above OBrien the HUMIDIFIER HISSES sodium pentothal
wafting down

He grits his rubbery teeth and cranks the lever

It CLICKS one more tooth

Sweat pours down his face but just as the TOOTH CLICKS
the arm shaft bends and --

OBrien collapses into a watery pile

down

his improved waste system

Makeo unscrews the tank locks and steps back

STEAM WHEEZES from the opening as a strange figure
emerges covered in a Saran Wrap caul

Hunched over the figure coughs a gelatinous mass from its
lungs as it tears itself free of the layer of polymerized
sweat

No longer a debilitated cripple Argon rises to his feet
as everyone sees the massive physique restored to all its

former glory

Oh my God

His arms reach out to the heavens as he lets loose the
scream that has been trapped for so long inside

Oh no
The CREW members hear the SCREAM and stop working One of
them notices her

Hey Hold it Stop

They rush at her Searching for any kind of weapon Susan
grabs a fire extinguisher from the wall

Swinging it like a club she lets the first one have it
but --

It too has been polymerized and the red tank bounces off
his skull

SUSAN
Nuts

CREW 2
Lady youre in serious trouble

He throws her back against the wall which she springs off
of kicking him in the balls --

Finally finding something solid

Screaming he falls to his knees his hose spewing liquid
nitrogen

The second man grabs her causing her to drop the
extinguisher into the puddle of foaming nitrogen

They wrestle until she tears herself free snatching hold
of the extinguisher She whips around --

Clubbing him again but this time the frozen TANK EXPLODES
over his head frothing like a shattered beer bottle

He falls to the soft mat-like floor

Sim pushes into the lab and sees Argon still wearing
bikini briefs bouncing Poppy into the air with his huge

rubberized arms

SIM
Holy
Argon hears him

ARGON
Exactly right Mr Sim You have
entered one of the holiest places on
Earth

He catches Poppy and she cuddles against his chest

ARGON
This lab shall forever be
consecrated ground and you Mr Sim
stand here a witness to mans
ultimate triumph the
polymerization of human flesh

Nebbleman is behind him using a razor to cut his hair
like Susan did to Daniel

NEBBLEMAN
Sir please try to hold still

SIM
So I guess it worked
ARGON
Worked Worked
Argon laughs
ARGON

A watch works Mr Sim A
bureaucrat works What transpired
here cannot be measured by the word
work

His chest swells as if he were posing down for Mr
Universe

ARGON
What you see before you is the
culmination of evolution The
realization of the one driving
desire at the heart of all great
human endeavors the desire for
immortality The polymerization of
human flesh is no mere molecular
transmutation no simple scientific
procedure it is nothing short of a
miracle A miracle that marks the
ascension of man from the finite to
the infinite From the transient to
the everlasting

His perfect white teeth high-beam the room Poppy stares
adulation oozing from every pore

Oh Icky

Argon kisses her hard

Look I dont mean to rain on
everyones ascension here but we

got a little problem

No The captain of the containment
crew is closing down the main lab
He says the area has got to be
evacuated

collapse under its own weight

And if we evacuate what do you want
to do with OBrien

Itll be better for us if he simply
disappears The gardener will know

what to do

The glass cutter tracing the circle has completely lost
its shape his FINGER SQUEAKING against the Plexiglas

The Gardener leads Sim Doby and Nebbleman towards
OBriens geranium

SIM
Can I ask you something Do you
ever take that mask off

The Gardener shakes his head

SIM
Doesnt it get hot

The Gardener nods

At the end of the path they reach OBriens tank
OBrien sleepily lifts his head

SIM
Sorry pal Check out time Moral
of story next life mind your own
business

The Gardener begins to shut off the valves The gauges
drop to zero as the gas OPENING at the top of the tank
RASPS and goes SILENT

Immediately OBrien knows that he is going to suffocate

He screams and pounds on the Plexi

They all watch as his soft rubbery fists mash uselessly
against the walls of the tank

SIM
Even a plastic mans gotta breathe
eh Doc
Nebbleman is too entranced to reply
At the far end of the conservatory the door swings open

Sim glances over his shoulder and sees a member of the
containment Crew striding toward them

SIM
What are you doing here Youre
supposed to be looking for the

woman
CREWMAN
We found her
The voice is muffled by the headgear
SIM

What Did you say you found her

Body catches the scent of something fishy He turns to
the Crew Member

Behind Sim OBrien sucks at the thinning air his punches
growing weaker

The Crew Member lunges at Sim but Doby is ready --

Seizing hold of the small body while tearing off the
helmet revealing Susan Bright

NEBBLEMAN
Susan

SIM
Wellie well Dr Bright Youre
just in time
OBriens eyes bulge when he sees her but he knows it is
too late His hands press against the plexi his eyes

melt into silicon tears

SUSAN
Nooo

Like a wild animal she bites Doby twisting free just long
enough to jump at Sim and --

Snatch the gun from his belt

Sim grabs her wrist and they fight for control until Susan
manages to squeezes off a SINGLE SHOT --

That punches a hole in OBriens tank

The hole is tiny but it is all Plastic Man needs
He dives at it thinning to a pencil driving himself
through

He emerges from the other side like a genie freed from
his lamp

SIM
Uh-oh

Afraid now Sim twists Susans arm behind her back and
yanks the gun free

Nebbleman cowers behind Doby
The Gardener slips away hurrying for his spray can

OBrien faces Sim his eyes blazing with malice
aforethought

Sim hides behind Susan holding the gun to her barely
able to see over her shoulder

SIM
Here we go again eh OBrien I
got the gun I got the girl All
you got is some rubber underwear
He laughs feeling a little better
OBrien points a single finger that creeps slowly at Sim
OBRIEN
Ive been thinking about you Mr

Sim

Sim watches it as the tip shapes into a fish hook

OBRIEN
All the different ways that I could
kill you
SIM
Oh yeah
He aims the gun at OBrien
SIM

Maybe youre ready to find out if
that hide of yours is bulletproof

OBRIEN
The question is are you

Sim thumbs back the hammer

OBRIEN
Because once you pull the trigger
if that bullet doesnt kill me we
both know youre a dead man

Sims hand shakes

SIM
I aint afraid of no plastic man

BOOM

The bullet sinks into OBriens chest pushing his flesh
back with a shrieking stretch projecting it out behind
him impossibly until --

The bullet stops

OBrien looks back at Sim whose eyes fill with fear

Susan dives to the ground as the bullet comes rushing back
and --

With a resounding whip crack hits Sim right in the chest
Sim sinks to the ground dead

Doby howls and rushes OBrien who turns his fists into
sledgehammers

Nebbleman bolts but Susan snatches hold of him
SUSAN
Do you know the best thing about
having you as an assistant Nigel
She wrings the lapel of his lab coat
SUSAN
Was knowing that if you ever pissed
me off I could always kick your
ass

She winds up just as Nebblemans eyes cross

NEBBLEMAN
Ohhh

He faints into a bruise colored bush She shakes her
head

OBrien pounds the sound of chirping birds into Dobys
skull as Susan sees the Gardener rushing behind him

SUSAN
Daniel

But the spray can is already HISSING pumping out deadly
clouds of red gas
OBRIEN
Not this time pal

OBrien clasps his hands together and forms a giant
bellows that sucks up all the gas

OBRIEN
Lets see how you like it

He shoves the nozzle of the bellows into the filter of his
gas mask and squeezes

The dark glass eyes fill with smoke as the Gardener
thrashes around trying to get the mask off

He stumbles flailing wildly and smashes into the
seamonkey geranium

The little creatures swarm all over him as he collapses to
the ground

OBrien turns just as Susan rushes into his arms

OBRIEN
You saved my life

SUSAN
Did you think I could just leave

you

They hold each other tightly feeling the volatile
electrons charging the air creating an intermolecular
bond between them

off his face

The kiss is so intense it shakes the entire building
around them

As you can see I am a new man just

Oh no Youre not like me In
fact Im betting youre the same
greedy remorseless egomaniacal bad
guy you always were

OBrien pumps up a huge fist His forearm then goes slack
as he begins swinging the fist like a medieval morning
star

ARGON
It remains to be seen who is the
good guy and who is the bad guy
History is written by the victor
OBRIEN
The only history Im gonna write is
your obituary

He lunges the fist arcing down as Argon awkwardly
counters --

The blow connects snapping Argons head back

Get him Daniel Knock his block
off

Poppy hisses at Susan as the two women now edge toward one
another

OBrien presses his attack battering and bludgeoning
Argon --

Every blow landing with a loud rubber smack that
reverberates through Argons teeth

to tie OBrien up as --

His extending legs drive both men flying backwards --
Crashing through the enormous vista-windows

that what is happening behind me is

thing the world has ever seen

Argon is learning quickly morphing his body the way
OBrien does

Two men if they are indeed really
men locked in mortal combat

Pure Jack-the-King-Kirby pugilistics

One of them apparently the dangerous
radical environmentalist authorities
have been searching for The other
appears to be Icarus Argon or at
least Icarus Argon fifteen years

Fists flying blasted bodies hurling through the air only
to bounce right back

There are times singular fleeting
moments when a man glimpses an event
which he knows is going to change
the world Although I do not fully
understand what is happening here I
sense that this fight is somehow
about the future of the planet

closer and closer to the main lab

before she gets to her feet

makes me the good guy dont it
Ka-boom Lights out
Argon hits the ground with a wet smack

INT ARGONS OFFICE

Poppy is up first delivering a stiletto-heeled kick to
Susans face knocking her out

The building trembles again and Poppy forgets Susan and
hurries to the roof door

EXT GROUNDS

The crowd has burst apart running from the building
while OBrien shoulders Argon and heads for the main lab
floor

INT ROOF STAIRWELL

Poppy pushes outside to the roof The helicopter has
shifted toward the tilted edge

She climbs into the pilots seat
INT LAB STAIRWELL

OBrien climbs the polymerized stairs in giant steps He
is heading for Susans lab when --

Argons eyes snap open
INT ARGONS OFFICE
Susan wakes up as the BUILDING continues to GROAN

She goes to the elevator but it no longer works She then
sees the open roof door

INT HALL

Argon attacks with snake-like speed whip-wrapping both
arms like twin boa constrictors around OBriens neck
A small gak spits out as OBrien feels his windpipe
pinch

EXT ROOF

The helicopter BLADES begin to CHOP as Susan flings open
the roof door

INT HALL

OBrien throws himself backward against the wall trying
to smash Argon off him but --

Everything is polymerized

They bounce and roll into a smaller lab Argon wrapped
around OBrien like a creeping-ivy vine

OBrien thrashes through the room slamming into stainless
steel scientific equipment --

Only to bounce off them like they were nerf toys
Desperate he hurls them both at a large window but --

The polymerized glass balloons out both bodies visible
inside the bulging bubble that --

Snaps back slinging them across the lab and out into the
hall

EXT ROOF

Susan tries to climb into the helicopter when the tower
tilts more violently than ever

The helicopter slides out hooking its landing gear on the
guard rail flipping up out of control killing the

engine

Thrown free Susan slides toward the same edge where the
helicopter dangles precariously

Below them is the roof of the main lab
INT MAIN LAB

OBrien falls to his knees He is ready to give up when
he sees something

His face as red as his suit his breath a tiny rasp he
begins to crawl

ARGON
Die Die Damn you Why dont you
just die
The world spins and goes spotty as he collapses

ARGON
Yes

But his hands keep going cartoon fingers groping down the
hall toward --

The tank of liquid nitrogen still laying near the broken
fire extinguisher

The hands take hold of it --

ARGON
No Oh no

And come rushing back like the cavalry

Argon screams as the nitrogen sprays out soaking his
arms freezing them solid

A little frosted OBrien slips his head free while Argon
tries to crack apart his arms

He looks up and sees OBrien aiming the nitrogen again

ARGON
No OBrien Dont Please

OBrien lets him have it full frosting blast

He grabs hold of him and with two huge steps bursts into
Susans lab

INT SUSANS LAB
The room pulses with a seething sense of sickness as
everything turns to gray slime like a rotting banana

turning brown

Fluorescent lights drip like stalactites from the drooping
drop-ceiling

Equipment hangs like swamp-moss or sits in puddles like
melting chocolate

The center of the room is a crater the floor sagging
limply like a wet napkin

At the bottom of the crater where the assembler tank used
to be is a pond of pale glowing goo

Argon cracks his jaw loose They stand at the edge of the
crater

ARGON
Please OBrien dont do this to
me Ill give you anything you want
OBRIEN

Yeah Im going to finish what you

started --

OBrien sees the finger slither out like a black tentacle
around his leg OBrien slips free and --

Hurls Argon out over the crater

Argon screams as his finger reaches for the soft pipes
above the drop-ceiling

The finger finds a hold just before Argon hits the white
pool He bounces dangling above it

ARGON
You cant do this You owe me
OBrien I made you plastic I
made you

OBRIEN
Thats right And making me was the
biggest mistake you ever made

OBriens hand sears at us shaping into a huge pair of
scissors

Argon screams as the scissors clip through the finger
strand --

Dropping Argon into the pond of moon-milk
Almost immediately there is an reaction

The pool sizzles and begins to swell into a single
volcanic bubble

OBrien whirls and runs
EXT ROOF

Susan carefully slides to the edge reaching out to help
Poppy

SUSAN
Grab my hand

INT CONSERVATORY
The building is shaking as Nebbleman wakes up
INT LAB

The bubble continues to swell
INT HALL
OBrien races through the rubbery hall
EXT ROOF

Poppy is struggling to get out of the safety harness
when --

INT MAIN LAB
The bubble bursts
INT HALL

The force of the blast launches OBrien into the air and
he recoils tucking himself into a ball --

Super-bouncing down the hall
EXT ROOF

The building shivers from the explosion and the helicopter
pitches back

Swinging out from Susan who loses her balance and slips
INT SUSANS LAB

The chain reaction spreads out from the crater as
molecules shift rebounding changing into an ionic
solid --

Like blown glass that is cooled too quickly --
Shivering with the sound of CRACKING ICE FLOES

EXT ROOF

The tower tips again ready to fall at any moment

Susan clings to the rail while inside the helicopter Poppy
is no longer struggling

She is staring up at the enormous full moon above her

POPPY
Icky

EXT MAIN LAB

OBrien dives from the lab as part of it collapses with a
shower of CRASHING GLASS

EXT ROOF

The rail gives out and the helicopter falls
It seems for a moment to drift like a snowflake as Poppy
reaches at the moon

POPPY
Plastic means forever

It hits the roof and shatters through it as though it were
sheet candy

Susan is thrown out over the edge dangling from the rail
as --

The helicopter shatters through the building with an ear-
bleeding CRASH before its metal carcass bursts into
flames

As Susan clings to the rail she looks up and sees
Nebbleman He stares at her through his broken glasses

NEBBLEMAN
This is all your fault Susan

He bends toward her clutching fingers
EXT GROUNDS
OBrien is searching everywhere for Susan

OBRIEN
Susan Susan

EXT ROOF
Nebbleman is peeling up her fingers when --
The tower begins to fall

With a final METAL SHRIEK the legs give out completely
Still holding on Susan falls with the tower

Nebblemans eyes bulge as he is thrown over the rail and
into the fiery abyss

OBrien looks up as the tower arcs down and sees Susan
clinging dangling about to be buried beneath it

OBRIEN
Noooo

A red rubber rocket sears across the night sky
Susans grip fails and she drops into --

OBrien who has flattened himself out like a giant luge
chute
She slides away as the tower collapses into the fiery
oblivion falling lightly into the soft waiting arms of

SUSAN
My hero

They kiss

We RISE ABOVE them REACHING UP FOR the moon in all its
luminous glory WATCHING as it morphs into a blazing sun

We PAN DOWN TO a new day
EXT CITY STREET

OBrien is carrying a brown bag filled with groceries
Susan is walking beside him

She suddenly starts laughing

SUSAN
God when we were in that store all
I could think about was that one
time when we were in school and
you attacked that little kid who
wanted some cereal Do you remember
that

OBRIEN
I remember I was trying to help

SUSAN
God what a fight that was

OBRIEN
We were different people then

SUSAN
Do you suppose that was our problem
We met before our time I think
that happens a lot People events
planets all just circling each other
waiting for that moment when
everything clicks into place

OBrien is no longer listening to her staring at
something like an attack dog

SUSAN
That moment of synchronicity where
everything seems to work out just
the way it should

Walking straight toward them is the Litterbug

SUSAN
I suppose if there were a god it
would be those moments that would
make me believe in her or him

Just like he did before the Litterbug gulps froma
styrofoam cup

SUSAN
Daniel what is

She sees what he is staring at just as the Litterbug
crumbles the cup and pitches it into the bushes

SUSAN
Oh no

The Litterbug continues toward them
SUSAN
Daniel please dont not today

its such a nice day

She watches him bracing for the attack jaw working
hackles raising fists clenching

SUSAN
Aww shit

The Litterbug reaches them shoves his way past and
OBrien --

Lets him go He smiles

OBRIEN
Youre right It is a nice day

He walks over and picks up the cup himself

OBRIEN
I can throw it out No big deal

She cant believe it His arm shoots out and a moment
later whaps back the cup is gone

She smiles and he wraps his arm around her

SUSAN
Things do change

OBRIEN
I guess they do

They stroll on and we GLIDE BACK in the direction his arm
shot --

Where we see the Litterbug wedged head first into a wire
meshed trash can kicking like an inverted cockroach the
styrofoam cup stuffed in his mouth
And we CLOSE ON the sign --
Keep litter in its place
FADE OUT

THE END
