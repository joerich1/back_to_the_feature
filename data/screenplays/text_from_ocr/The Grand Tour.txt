EXT HIGHLANDS ABOVE SPOKANE -- WINTER -- LATE AFTERNOON

A vision of a charcoal smudge against banked snow Reveal the smudc
to be a Darth Vader black jeep

In the jeep we catch spit-polish black boots pressing the
accelerator We follow up legs covered in fire proofed flight-suit
khaki We hover at a chest neutered by a flight jacket emblazoned
with lightning bolts clasped in a mailed fist we travel past a name
tag stenciled MOREAU to a moon-man white helmet framing the face
of a woman A fresh scrubbed American face with beautiful eyes and
awisp of dark hair

The black jeep whines past us towards the main gate at Fairchild
Aix Force Base

CLOSER -- FAIRCHILD MAIN GATE

A young airman with only a blue beret to protect him against the
morning cold blows on his hands to keep them warm He HEARS the
nigh pitched sound of the jeep approaching smiles as ne assumes
his proper position at the guard gate

All business now the young aizman returns MOREAUs salute As she
Passes through she glances in her rear-view mirror and catches the
guards barely suppressed smile Behind him a large sign reads
CAUTION YOU ARE NOW ENTERING THE MOST DANGEROUS AREA IN THE

WORLD « THE AMERICAN HIGHWAY

EXT FAIRCHILD AIR FORCE BASE -- WASHINGTON STATE -- DAWN

MOREAU cruises through the base past rows of old barracks then up
along the ridge above the flight line Below her stretched ous in
a line and bathed in surreal pea-soup yellow lights stand six
jungle camouflaged B-52s Ice mist wisps off their long drooping
nuclear armed wings

EXT FAIRCHILD ALERT PACILITY -- DAWN --

MOREAU parks her jeep and walks along the barbed wire cyclone fence
towards the half buried bunker-like ALERT FACILITY Her breath
misting in the morning cold she arrives at the first metal gate

A sign reads DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED

MOREAQ walks through the first gate and is momentarily trapoed as it
closes behind her A second gate does not open She is
scrutinised TV cameras whirring sensors sensing A loud electronic
CLICK and the second gate opens revealing a guard with loose slung
M16 on his shoulder pearl handled pistol on his hip and a beret
He does not smile

The guard runs a metal detector up and down the inside of MOREAUs
legs Cleared she now walks up the ramp towards the facility where
she will Sull a week of standby nuclear aler guty
INT GAME ROOM -- ALERT FACILITY
EXTREME CLOSEUP KAZAKLISS FACE

He is intensely concentrating The eyes however belie a late night

at the bar of the High Pine Lounge from which he has too recently
come

EXTREME CLOSEUP -- KAZAKLISS FINGERS -

We HEAR KAZAKLISs voice send light speed signals to his fingers
We HEAR the electronic blip every time the FIRE button is pushed
followed by an electronic explosion sound The fingers deftly
follow each command

KAZAKLIS (v0)

Left ten fire (blip) left five
fire (blip) Left five fire (blip)
Right ten fire (blip) Right ten

CLOSEUP -- SPACE INVADERS ELECTRONIC ARCADE GAME SCREEN

Two more invaders move steadily down towards the bottom of the
screen where the electronic spaceship lies in wait

KAZAKLIS (vo
Left five fire Left five fire
(blip blip)

INT GAME ROOM -- ALERT FACILITY

KAZAKLIS pushes back from the controls of the Space Invaders game
as it plays a Little electronic victory song He smiles He is
good He has to be He is the best pilot and the worst example in
the Strategic Air Command

The game room looks like early Holiday Inn Cinder-block walls pool
tables card tables chairs and sofas A window framed with curtains
that upon closer examination is net a real window at all but

merely a realistic mural of a desert scene drawn in 3-D perspective

MOREAU enters with a rolled up flight plan map and sits down next

to HALUPALAI the big Hawaiian tail gunner the oldest of the crew
and the only NCO Halupalai is staring off into space out tne fake
desert window

Moreau spreads a flight plan map on the card table It shows a B-52
heading north toward Russia Then it makes a sudden loop and a
bee-line for Tahiti

MOREAU
Well

—

HALOPALAI
Tahitis now a strategic target
Captain
MOREAU

I thought it would make an
interesting conversation piece the
next time the base commander brings
a visiting Senator by

HALUPALAI
(laughs) Only you could get away with
that

Moreau looks at Kazaklis who is back playing Space Invaders His
butt sways left then right he is whistling America the Beautiful”
Moreau turns back to Halupalai and gives him a wicked grin She
rolls up her map and walks up behind Kazaklis She Pauses His butt
is still swaying left and right and hes whistling for amber
waves of grain

MOREAU
Captain

KAZAKLIS
Not now Moreau

Another pause The butt still swaying to the rhythm of the machine
The whistling even louder Then in quick cuts

-She jams her rolled up map between Kazaklis legs
-The green alien adversary on the screen lets go with a blast
-Kazaklis explodes simultaneously with the machine

EXT CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN - COLORADO -- DUSK

We are high OVERLOOKING skiers schussing down Powdery slopes A

disappears we move DOWN DOWN past the skiers into the snow DOWN
DOWN DOWN into the mountains bowels Continuing down we emerge
into a dank tunnel whose black walls weep moisture

INT CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN -- TUNNEL

We come to rest behind a GENERAL who is standing in wait for a 25
ton steel door to finish opening The General begins to move forward
towards a Styxian city and we move with him
a

INT CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN - COMMAND BALCONY AND OPERATIONS ROOM

The General emerges onto the glassed-in command balcony overlooking
a room filled with men peering into green screens

The screens are powered by computers Linked to orbiting satellites
The satellites are tuned to Russian Steppes as well as to silent
rectangular boxes which represent yankee class soviet submarines
that have been tracked under the seas

There are many clocks in the room tuned to Moscow Omaha Plesetsk
Kapustin Yar Washington and the universal time of Zulu (Greenwich
meantime)

There are signs that ask ARE YOU EWO READY And there are alert
codes that read in order of readiness APPLE JACK LEMON JUICE
SNOWMAN BIG NOISE COCKED PISTOL FAST PACE ROUND HOUSE
DOUBLE TAKE FADE OUT

Watching all the watchers watching stands the General Below him
a CANADIAN RAF OFFICER fiddles with his screen that has boxed the
rough location of a soviet sub 175 miles off the coast of Neah Bay
Washington On the sound of a blip we go to

INT ALERT FACILITY -- MOREAUS DORM ROOM - FAIRCHILD AFS--

The door opens revealing a medieval chastity belt stretched across
it as Moreau enters Sprawled across the second of two bunks is a
woman tanker pilot doing a crossword puzzle

MOREAU
eo Hi

ROOMMATE
« Hmmmm

Moreau crosses to her bunk and begins to unroll and tack up che
flight plan map we saw her with earlier After a moment the roommate
looks up from her crossword puzzle

ROOMMATE
You know youre really pushing it
Moreau

Moreau continues tacking up her map paying no attention The
Roommate stands now annoyed

ROOMMATE
OK if the map goes up then that
(pointing) has got to come down

The roommate is pointing a mock centerfold of EDWARD TELLER in
living color with a small photograph of a mushroom cloud planted
squarely between his scrawny legs

MOREAU
What have you got against the
ultimate climax dear
INT CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN -- COMMAND BALCONY AND OPERATIONS ROOM

The young RAF officer is tapping his sezeen in agitation Three
more blips have appeared from the same zone off Neah Bay Next to
him a young AMERICAN LIEUTENANT watches in fascination distracted
from his own screen

Blip Suddenly out of the corner of his eye he catches a spasm
appear on his own screen which is trained on a patch of ocean in
the Georgia Banks off New England

Blip On another screen more blips appear of North Carolina and on
another a stacatto blip appears in the Pacific beyond Catalina in
Southern California

The general watches patiently from above He pushes a button
changing the alert code from APPLE JACK to LEMON JUICE He starts
to reach for a phone then draws back

GENERAL
(to Aide) Check and make sure
someone hasnt slipped a training
tape into the main computer bank

Another computer screen and a watcher is flipping his screen on and
off then pulling the picture in tight for magnification The screen
shows flexing molars like computer game aliens near Plesetsk in the
arctic north of Moscow The words SILO DOORS OPENING flash in a
corner of the screen

The General flicks the alert code from LEMON JUICE to SNOW MAN as
you really begin to feel the electricity

AIDE
There is no training tape in the
computer sir

The General reaches to his right to pick up the direct line phone
GENERAL

into the scene She must reluctantly take the child and go eli ity

The mother suddenly screams Tyler turns to see his boy running
towards him Tyler angrily places his hands on his hips

The boy freezes uncertainly He turns to see his mother racing
after him The boy bolts away from both parents towards the
drooping wings of the B-52s

The boy slips on the frozen tarmac and skids near a wheel The
mother is running after him WHOMP She falls hard The air
rushes out of her a foot is placed firmly on her back a riot gun
inches from her head A second white form does the same to the
child They are the security patrol in winter white camouflage

Tyler understands and moves slowly towards them

TYLER

The foot comes off the boy first The woman more slowly Tyler
picks up the boy and spanks him The boys eyes fill with tears
Tyler hands him back to his mother and says tonelessly

A SAC four star Air Force GENERAL (GENERAL BLUE) cradles a phone
He is listening to the two star General from Cheyenne but as we
watch the light on his face changes from white fluorescent to pale
luminous blue Red lights like tracer bullets race across his
forehead

BLOE GENERAL
Okay Ive put us on a combat
footing Lets scramble the fighters
to take a look-see

We now begin to REVEAL the command balcony at SAC headquarters

The General hangs up the phone He sits in an overstuffed leather
chair in front of other phones and buttons Below are some smaller
screens like at Cheyenne but the room is dominated by six 16 x 16
screens at eye level with the command balcony The General jabs

at some controls

Lets get the big picture up there

The main screen flutters briefly in a televideo snowstorm and then
up pops a large polar map looking down on the northern hemisphere
The other screens show our missile installations B-52 bases and
navy subs The General shudders On the center screen out of the
flexing molars near PLESETSK come snaking white lines with computer
projections of missilesk All of them cross American coast lines
The General moves the status from SNOWMAN to BIG NOISE

The General looks at the screen in front of him watching the white
lines snake further from Plesetsk He sees one of the side screens
spewing out data It shows one of the missiles achieving
sub-orbital flight over the Arctic Ocean and the margin of error

on the missiles trajectory is instantly reduced The Generals
voice becomes brittle

PREMIER (v0)
My dear Mr President By now you
are aware that my government has
launched a limited number of nuclear
weapons at your country The
missiles are selectively destined
for targets which will infliet
minimum damage on your great nation
and its civilian population and even
its military resources

(MORE)

PREMIER (Contd)

Your wisdom at this delicate time

Can minimize the consequences of this
event which the mistakes of both
nations have made inevitable The
Parameters of our action must be
clear to you by now a strike at
all your bomber bases a single ICBM
complex in Montana and your primary
command facilities at Omaha and
Cheyenne Mountain These show the
obvious that all your targets
like all ours are vulnerable There
is one final element A single small
warhead has been directed at Andrews

Aix Force Base

It has been set for

ground burst explosion which will

do little damage beyond the base

The target is symbolic Andrews being
the base from which you would
normally leave Washington Some of
my colleagues demanded the inclusion
of an intimidation factor It will
do you no personal harm

Mz President please there is so
little time

The President glances up briefly then resumes reading The Russian
Premiers voice continues as before

PREMIER (v0)
Tt is of epochal importance that you
understand my rationale and recognize
that this is not an attempt at
territorial or political gain rt
is a moderate response to political
realities inside my nation and
your nation as well We have talked
to no avail and the insanity
continues Quite simply Mr
President my nation cannot afford
to match your arms buildups Nor
can it allow them to go unmatched
Two weeks ago the Politburo voted
to mount a full scale pre-emptive
attack against your military and
strategic targets A second assault
was poised against your cities if
you responded f was able to delay
that action But I have merely
Rpught us a brief moment for one
last perhaps desperate effort to
halt the madness

(MORE)

INT B
PREMIER (Contd)
I think we all the leaders of both
our nations knew it inevitably must
come to this - or worse Therefore
to be blunt Mr President you now
have three choices only two of which
are acceptable to us You can accept
the damage and we will stop the
world divided as it is now between
us Like you I am a politician
I cannot imagine my political system
allowing me to accept that choice
Your second choice is to respond with
a limited counter attack that
inflicts on my nation a similar
amount of damage We will accept
that provided the worlds spheres
of influence remain the same and the
arms increases cease our
Calculations show that you will lose
between six and nine million people
in our attack We will accept a
Similar loss It is a tremendous
price to pay but perhaps it can serve
as a symbol that shows all factions
in both our nations the lunacy of
the game we have been playing You
will be under tremendous pressure
as I was to respond massively This
is your third choice If this is
your ultimate choice my government
already has decided to reply in kind
even before your missiles land 1
pray now Mr President that the
distrust is not total and that
through the pain of the next few
Minutes you make the decision that
can bring this to a less than perfect
end but an end

He then lunges out of his seat and reaches across the cockpit
towards Moreaus curtain In the closeness his gloved hand
accidentally catches Moreau in the LEFT EYE before he grasps the
curtain The plane NOSES DOWNWARD as Moreau drops the controls
pulling her hand up over her left eye Kazaklis wrenches at the
curtain and succeeds in closing all but a narrow gap

He sits back in his Seat takes the controls and steadies the plane

Moreau sits mute for a moment her left hand remaining over her eye
Now with her right hand she stretches forward to close the gap in
the curtain We SEE her one eye staring Then we SEE her pov of

not

Our ICBMs were launched in two waves
Most of our bombers were caught on
the ground Those bombers that
survived should be at their positive
control points If ordered to go in
they will reach their targets in four
to six hours The bulk of our
submarine forces in which we carry
most of our destructive power was
placed on hold for exactly eleven
hours Seven hours from now their
instructions are to hit their targets
unless they receive contrary orders
The assumption is If they cant
hear us then were still at war
The subs would constitute our third
strike and complete the destruction
of the Soviet Union

Even the Minnesota Air National Guard
could knock them down

HARPOON
Colonel would you Like to go to the
phone and order them into the air
We cant even talk to Minneapolis
Every transistor in Minnesota is
burned out We wont be able to stop
half of them and theyre going to
pick off their targets one by
Goddamned one New York
Philadelphia Denver

CONDOR
And our bombers will do the same
thing

HARPOON

No The bombers that did get off
will be under attack by Soviet
fighter interceptors

CONDOR
The Soviets can attack our bombers
and we cant attack theirs

HARPOON
Sir they had the element of surprise
and they spent a lot of money on
bomber defenses as we wanted them
to Wasting money on defenses for
a war with no defense

CONDOR
This is the mest cockamamie
defeatest thing Ive ever heard
What about the subs How many
warheads we got in there

HARPOON
About 7000 siz

CONDOR
Launch ‘em - before the Soviet
Planes hit our cities

HARPOON
I understand your frustration sir
but thats an impossible order

CONDOR
You refuse a direct order

HARPOON
I cant order the submarines to do
anything Nor can you They
received orders hours ago to run
silent and deep away from detection
or communications for eleven hours
Then the main part of the fleet will
come back near the surface to listen
If they hear nothing they will fire
Thats the system The Soviets know
the system as well as we do They
know if their bombers strike if they
send off more ICBMs theyre dead
Because therell be no one left and
no reason to call off the submarines

CONDOR
Youre telling me the fate of our
nation rests with a dead computer

HARPOON
Well not quite sir The war plans
were devised with a purpose Both
sides knew if this thing ever got
started wed have tremendous
problems with ego national pride
communications So we built in
pauses Bombers are very slow They
are a built-in natural pause to the
war We are in that pause but
coming to the end of it

CONDOR
And the pause was designed to do
precisely what

HARPOON
To give us time to patch our
communications sir And to give
you and your Soviet counterpart time
to think things over and maybe find
a way to turn the war off You have
a copy of the Premier ‘s message in
the folder in front of you I dont
know what to make of it but he
offered to accept an equal amount
of damage in the Soviet Union

CONDOR (sarcastically)
A relatively even exchange

COLONEL JONES
A historic strategic blunder

HARPOON
I cant assess his motives I can
only tell yeu that I think our best
eption is to turn some of our bombers
and see how the Soviets respond
Well still have the subs in reserve
Really siz I think its our only
option right now

COLONEL JONES
Bullshit There is another option
God damn it We can cut the head
off the chicken Tell him about the
chicken

COLONEL JONES
I will keep my words brief clear
and devoid of defeatist philosophy
Victory is possible sir and its
not all that complicated To call
back our bombers would not move the
Soviets They would see it as a sign
of weakness We have an opportunity
to allow the Soviet people to throw
off the yoke of totalitarian
dictatorship which has oppressed them
so long They will do it as surely
as they overthrew the Czars during
the First World War

HARPOON
For Christs sake Colonel they
dont even know where their leaders

are
COLONEL JONES
No Admiral they do not But we
f do And you would withdraw the very

weapon with which we would do it
The Colonel orders a change in the Soviet computer map

COLONEL JONES
Mr President these green dots
represent Soviet leadership bunkers
Inside those bunkers are the party
hierarchy the Presidium KGB
leaders military commanders and
almost surely the Russian Premier
They are the head of the Soviet
chicken Cut off that head and the
body dies The system dies
Forever

You telling me a handful of B-52s
can do that

COLONEL JONES
The perfect instrument sir ICBMs
or sub launched missiles arent

COLONEL JONES
Victory has its price Admiral We
are in a war sir a nuclear war
I suggest its time we started
thinking about how to win it No
smoke signal is going to stop Soviet
bombers But we do have some
fighters and we also have thousands

a of commercial jets available We
of can ram the bastards

situation here Need a little more
info on our naval forces Who is
authorized to issue new orders to
the submarines
HARPOON
Only you can issue orders to the
submarines sir Through the TACAMO
planes
CONDOR
What if someone else counterfeited
the codes so the orders seemed to
come from me
XK

HARPOON
I dont see how sir

CONDOR
Your friend Alice seems pretty good
at doing that with the Air Force

HARPCON
Sir I dont see

happens if the TACAMO planes get
conflicting orders

Answer me Harpoon

HARPOON
What did the Russian bombers do

Harpoon looks accusingly around the room The silence speaks
volumes

The Russian bombers turned in
response didnt they Sir you’
cant even be considering the use
of subs now

CONDOR
Talk to me about conflicting orders
Harpoon

HARPOON

The Soviets couldnt make their
intentions clearer

COLONEL JONES
And committed an ineredible stratagic
blunder Its now our subs against
their remaining ICBMs And our subs
are a lot closer to them than their
ICBMs are to us Before they know
what hit them it will be too late

CONDOR
One more time Admiral What would
happen if the TACAMO planes got
conflicting orders

HARPOON
Please siz

Condor motions to the Secret Service Agent who quickly backs Harpoc
up against the bulkhead jamming the barrel of his uzi submachine
gun underneath Harpoons chin

CONDOR
Admiral

Harpoon looks into the eyes of the Secret Serviceman and determines
that hes capable of pulling the trigger

HARPOON
If both commands had the proper codes
the TACAMO planes would be confused
They would suspect that the Soviets
had spoofed one set They would
proceed with the original orders for
the subs to fire at 2100 ZULU

CONDOR
Thats all Admiral Youre
dismissed

The Secret Serviceman removes his gun and backs off

HARPOON
Sir I

CONDOR
Dismissed

Condor turns his back on Harpoon Harpoon looks humiliated and
defeated Ail eyes avert his In desperation Harpoon lunges for
Conder Harpoon grabs him around the neck trying to strangle the
life out of the successor with every fiber in his body Harpoon
sees the Secret Service Agent cock his gun Harpoon shouts He
has a maniacal gleam in his eye

HARPOON
Shoot Shoot Please Bring this
plane down Please shoot

The Agent lowers his gun Everyone seems paralyzed for a moment
when suddenly an ornately tooled leather belt is whipped around
Harpoons neck The belt twists hard cutting off his airflow
WIDEN TO REVEAL the Fat Man from Baton Rouge as the initiator of
this improvised yet effective rescue For a few moments it is a
test of wills but finally Harpoon is no match for the three hundred
pounds of bulk Harpoon loses his grip on Condor His own face
becomes distorted and suddenly he is gone

There must be some other way

ALICE
Mr President we have less than one
hour before the subs will fire I
have serious doubts there is any way
to stop it But if we are able to
reach the TACAMO planes you can bet
the E-4 will be able to reach them
If those planes get conflicting
orders the subs will stick with
their original battleplan ts that
simple

PRESIDENT
What do you think Sedgewick

SEDGEWICK

Im afraid the Generals right Mr

President However to make anything
work the General will have to read
me the authenticator codes Digit

by digit Letter by letter That is
extremely dangerous We know the
Soviets can probably hear the Looking
Glass since theyve got a couple of
Satellites functioning £ they pick
up the codes theyll have almost

as much control over our weapons as
you do sir
