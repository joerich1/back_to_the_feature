A news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE Standing by
are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS GUSTOV and VOL two SHORT STOCKY
MEN along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family
employees A 30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY sign hangs in the
background
BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror desperately trying
to place a large segment of wayward hair
BRUCE
Oh God no The hairs wrong
This is a bad sign
(calling out)
We really need to get a make-up
person
The segment producer ALLY LOMAN steps over
ALLY
Not in the budget And not to

worry youre going to look great
in this
She holds out a HAIR NET
BRUCE
A hair net Im not wearing a hair
net I just did the hair
ALLY
(matter of fact)
Health code In the kitchen or
around the cookie you gotta have
it
BRUCE
(to crew re hair net)
You guys should tell me this
before hand this is like a huge
waste ofmoose
Bruce spreads the hair net bends down out of frame comes up
looking ridiculous and very disgruntled
BRUCE
Remind me to swing by an elementary
school after this and serve lunch
Ally laughs

ALLY

Youre a thing of beauty In

three two one
Bruce SNAPS from pissed to instant charismatic TV newsman
(Note Whenever Bruce speaks on camera he speaks in his
REPORTERS VOICE - that recognizable too-smooth delivery
that all news reporters seem to have In mathematical terms
Bruces version is to the 7th power)

BRUCE

For three decades the Kowolski

Family Bakery has been a mainstay

in downtown Buffalo Known for

their sinfully rich cream filled

deep fried polski pierogis And

the occasional sugar induced coma

that follows Today in honor of

their 30 year anniversary Momma

Kowolski and her sons Gustov and

Vol decided to do something a

little bit different Tell me

guys how did this idea come about

GUSTOV
Well Vol said to me Gustov why
dont we make the biggest chocolate
chip cookie in Buffalo And I
said Yeah sure
BRUCE

Wow Fascinating
Bruce steps up to the HUGE COOKIE
BRUCE
The previous Buffalo cookie record
was 3 feet 17 inches baked by
Gladys Pelsnick But this behemoth
cookie clearly proving that Gustov
and Vol have much more free time
The Kowolski brothers and all celebrate in the background
toasting with big mugs of milk Bruce steps forward looks
dramatically at camera slow zoom in as he speaks
BRUCE (CONTD)
As we witness the ceremonial
toasting with milk it makes one
pause and think What are we
really looking at here
(MORE)
BRUCE (CONTD)

Is it just a big cookie or does
this cookie represent the pride of
Buffalo Our dedicated and hard
working citizens the key
ingredient with a few nuts thrown
in

(motions his eyes to the

Kowolski twins)
And finally the love of our
families which provides the warm
chewy center making our beloved
Buffalo the sweetest place to live

Camera is in CLOSE as Bruce signs-off
BRUCE (CONTD)

And thats the way the cookie

crumbles Im Bruce Nolan

Eyewitness News

GRACE

Grace stands pulling Bruce up
GRACE

DAN RATHER
The body of Jimmy Hoffa was
uncovered in a field today outside
of a canine training center in
Buffalo New York Local Buffalo
freelance field reporter Bruce
Nolan was the first on the scene

We cut to the pre-taped story Bruce stands with Hank and
his trainer before camera the body being exhumed from the
ground behind him
BRUCE

Since the disapearence of Teamster
president Jimmy Hoffa in the
nineteen sixties his whereabouts
have remained one of this countrys
great unsolved mysteries That is
until just moments ago when during
a routine training session a
police dog named Hank sniffed his
way right into the history books
As you can see behind us the body
is being carefully exhumed and will
be transported to a hospital
facility where DNA testing will
confirm the identity That of
course only a formality as ina
bizarre twist the body was found
buried with a birth certificate and
complete set of dental records

(rubs Hanks neck)

Sort of a two-in-one for Hank

today as moments later he busted

a local news camera crew with four

kilos of marijuana
We see footage of PHIL AND HIS NEWS CREW being cuffed on the
ground as large stacks of marijuana plants are being pulled
from the van

You win I m done Please I

dont want to do this anymore I

dont want to be God

(sighs)

Please help me
And with that the rain stops The dark clouds slowly open
as beams of light cut through shining down upon Bruce
birds begin to chirpadding to this magical moment as
HONK1 HONKI

A MAC TRUCK SLAMS THROUGH FRAME MOWS BRUCE DOWN His spirit
remains in the same spot looking confused then STREAKS UP
heavenward
FLYING POV

SHOOTING HEAVENWARD like a missile THROUGH THE CLOUDS
THROUGH THE SKY to

A HUGE WHITE ROOM - No walls just white as far as the eye
can see The flooring is the whitest of white puffy clouds
Bruce finds himself standing there He looks around and when
he turns behind him he sees GOD Floating on nothing as
though sitting in the most royal throne
BRUCE
Am I
GOD
You cant expect to kneel down in
the middle of a highway and live to
talk about it
BRUCE
But why Why now
GOD
I work in mysterious ways son
A beat as Bruce takes everything in
BRUCE
You knew it all along You knew if
I got everything I wanted I would
ruin my life
God doesnt respond just listens
BRUCE
So Im dead Okay If this is
what you want Okay okay
God holds up the PRAYER BEADS tosses them to Bruce Bruce
looks at the beads then up at God puzzled

GOD
Go ahead use ‘em
BRUCE
Alright Ive learned that I
dont know as much I thought I
did
GOD
Boy you can say that again
BRUCE

Hey Im praying here

GOD
Sorry go
BRUCE
If I could have just one thing in
the world It would be for Grace
to live a happy joyful life And
that she finds someone
(getting emotional as he
realizes what hes
saying)
that she finds someone that will
treat her with the love and respect
that she so deserves
God smiles the most satisfied of smiles
GOD
Now that is a prayer
(beat)
Well I better get on that one
See ya Bruce
Off Bruces puzzled reaction he DROPS THROUGH THE CLOUDS --
FALLING POV - BACK DOWN TOWARDS EARTH back THROUGH THE
CLOUDS and right INTO ANOTHER WHITE ROOM where
BRUCE EYES OPEN and he GASPS FOR BREATH The PRAYER BEADS
still clutched tightly in his hand
TWO DOCTORS stop giving Bruce CPR see that his vitals have
returned

NURSE
Hes back
INTERN
BP 40 over 110 and rising
DOCTOR 1
(to Bruce) -

Bruce Can you hear me
(Bruce nods)

We almost lost you there
WIDER ANGLE - The WHITE ROOM is a HOSPITAL ROOM - Bruce is
heavily bruised and bandaged

DOCTOR 1

You lost a lot of blood It wasnt

easy to find a match - youre a

very rare blood type

Bruce looks to the blood bag sees AB Positive written on
the side
CLOSE ON BRUCE - THINKING HIS MIND RACING

BRUCE
(groggy whisper)
AB Positive
DOCTOR 2 (0S)
You should thank God for donors
We dont have a lot of that type on
hand
NURSE
Theres your angel now
Bruce turns toward the hospital door and sees
GRACE

A cotton swab taped to her arm Now he remembers where he
heard of that blood type
GRACE
(re her swab)

I hear that all of this winds up in

a warehouse somewhere But you

know me Im a sucker for this

stuff
The doctors give Grace the nod to enter as they go leaving
the two of them alone Grace tentatively approaches

GRACE
I dont even know what Im doing
here But When I heard that

youd been in an accident and that
you might not make it
She starts to cry

BRUCE
Hey Im okay
GRACE
Does it hurt
BRUCE
Only when I talk and smile and

yknow exist in general

Grace laughs Thats one thing Bruce could always do is
make her laugh Grace spots the prayer beads in Bruces
hand raises his arm
GRACE
Oh my gosh you still have those
Bruce looks at the prayer beads then looks at Grace He
remembers his prayer to God and the emotion wells within him

GRACE
What is it
BRUCE
Nothing Its just really nice to

see you

She goes to him Bruce sits up a bit and they embrace
DISSOLVE TO

had a poor knowledge of grammar

and did not know how to use the

possessive apostrophe so he called

Kowolski brothers have baked a one-
of-a-kind creation

piece takes a bite)

Kowolskis bakery The bakery that
gets more air time than a high
speed chase
Everyone laughs The Kowolski brothers beam
Bruce takes a seat as a VOLUNTEER NURSE pulls up his sleeve
revealing the prayer beads worn around his wrist She ties
off his arm starts to probe for a vein

BRUCE

fan of shots
The volunteer now is swabbing Bruces arm and Bruce is
starting to sweat

heading somewhere Bodies clear frame and we see the
HOMELESS MAN sitting on a park bench His sign reads
THEE END
The Homeless Man smiles into camera We continue forward and
in a slow mysterious subtle fashion his face slowly
transforms into the very pleased FACE OF GOD who winks and
