ELDERLY FOLKS watch current President Ronald Reagan on TV

elements He turns a page in a tattered OLD SCRAPBOOK

Gates

John turns the page to another photo of another GATES All
the Gates men bear a strong family resemblance

JOHN (CONTD)
-Generation after generation our
ancestors have tried to find
Charlotte and failed

BEN
Maybe Charlotte is an anagram You
know you rearrange the letters
and it means something else

John stops Hes never thought of that before

JOHN
Like hotel crate

BEN
Thats too many es Itd have to
be the hotel cart or tear cloth
or teal torch or Rachel Ott

Ben quickly rattles off the anagrams John is impressed

JOHN
Maybe youll be the one who finally
finds her

BEN

How will I know its the right
Charlotte when I do

UNFINISHED PYRAMID and ALL-SEEING EYE on the back

The unfinished pyramid and the all-
seeing eye The marks of the Knights
of the Templar

Ben studies the dollar-bill with newfound curious awe

as big as they said it was We

Ben scans the landscape ahead where the ice ends in a SHEER
GLACIAL CLIFF

BEN
The Inuits said they could still
see the masts poking up through the
ice just three generations ago

National Treasure 4903 9

RILEY

100-foot frigate

BEN

All right Im sorry I know Im

Ben motions with his head and Riley follows his gaze to

ACROSS THE STREET where Ian and Shaw climb into a SEDAN and
drive away Riley watches them go incredulous

»a LADY Actually its the LANDLADY (mid 50s) who greets

the spear gun pointed at her with a bored smile
LANDLADY

RILEY
Hello Mrs Doyle

50-ton steel vault where its
protected from heat cold even a
thousand years of nuclear winter
The entire process takes just two
minutes but during those two
minutes the Declaration of
Independence is vulnerable

RILEY
So thats when Ians going to do it

BEN
Doubt it A better time would be
to create a situation wherein the
Declaration would be automatically
lowered into its vault when the
guards arent there

RILEY
Well Iand have to create some
external chaos because theres no
way he can hack in

BEN
Why not

RILEY
Because most of these old government
facilities use the old Data-Link
encryption-based security system
Once youre in you can do whatever
you want but only a handful of
people know how to get in

BEN
And would one of those people happen
to be someone who gave up a good
life at Intel to help save his

country
RILEY
Could be

She regards them disdainfully She gets this all the time

ABIGAIL
All terrorist threats must be
reported directly to the FBI Let
me get you their number

She goes to get the number but is stopped by

RILEY
This isnt a terrorist threat The
people behind it are treasure hunters

ABIGAIL
And they want to steal the
Declaration of Independence
because

Riley looks to Ben but Ben looks away to a framed antique
button collection hanging on the wall

RILEY
(reluctantly)

Because theres a treasure map on
the back

ABIGAIL
Is this a joke

RILEY
We just found proof in a ship that
was wrecked over 200 years ago

Absolutely Ive seen it many times

National Treasure 4903

Have you ever touched it

ABIGAIL
Of course not No one touches it
Its hermetically sealed in a bullet-
proof thermopane case

BEN
That must frustrate you Seeing
something everyday and not being
able to touch it

Theres an undeniable charm about Ben but Abigail does her
best to shrug it off

ABIGAIL
I touch the case every day which
is closer than most people will
ever get to it Which makes me the
expert in this room about there
being or not being a map on the
back Which there is not

BEN

Thats because its invisible
RILEY

It is
BEN

Invisible inks were common back
then They were used by both the
British and American armies to send
secret spy letters during the
Revolutionary War

Abigail studies Ben interest piqued

BEN (CONTD)
Or the parchment could have been
palimpsest Animal skin paper wasnt
exactly easy to make and was--

ABIGAIL
--often cleaned and reused I know
what palimpsest is

BEN
Of course you do

ABIGAIL
So do you have any proof About
this invisible map

RILEY
It was in a riddle on an old pipe

ABIGAIL
May I see the pipe

Ben and Riley exchange a look then grudgingly

RILEY
We dont have it

Ben pulls out a handkerchief and starts wiping his

RILEY
Once we get it what are we going
to do with it

BEN
Look at the back

RILEY
We would

BEN
Of course If we dont look at the
back well never find the treasure
If we dont find the treasure
someone will always come looking
for the map which means the
Declaration of Independence will
always be in danger until we find
the treasure

Riley nods liking Bens reasoning

AGENT DAWES
They dont look like magic glasses

BEN
Theres nothing magic about it
Its an ancient optical effect
The Egyptians encoded all their
major art works with it Its
believed humans used to be able to
see the 3D images with the naked
eye but the human eye evolved

SADUSKY
Evolved

BEN
In the Bible the oceans are
described as being the color of
wine Thats because the human
eye couldnt see the color blue
back then Now it can Benjamin
Franklin was a genius and inventor
He designed these special lenses
and used this optical effect to
hide the map on the back of the
Declaration of Independence

SADUSKY
You sure you dont want a lawyer

BEN

Havent you ever wondered why all
those symbols are on the back of

BEN

You didnt shoot me Why

BEN

On the car You had a clear bead
on me Why didnt you take it

SADUSKY
Because you dont fire into a crowd

Because you knew there was something

Ian Howe cant find the treasure
without the glasses Ill cuta
deal with him Tell him Ill give
him the treasure if he gives us the

trade with Mr Howe

BEN
Ians too smart for that

Sadusky considers that nodding his head then

AGENT JOHNSON
You wanna know what I believe

Everyone looks to Agent Johnson

AGENT JOHNSON (CONTD)
That youd do anything to get your
hands on that treasure That you
and Ian Howe made a deal But once
you got close to it you both got
greedy and you each decided youd
get more of the treasure without

Well its night now and I dont

With that Ben pulls open the heavy church doors and

LIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE CHAPEL cutting a swath through the
graveyard casting EERIE TOMBSTONE SHADOWS everywhere

None of which look like an X Except maybe

Ben moves to where the shadow of a plant is cast onto the
wall of A LONG STONE CRYPT

Ben backtracks following the source of the shadow to

A GRAVESTONE Covered in ivy As Ben starts pulling away
the ivy Ian and the others approach

Ben clears the ivy revealing the gravestone We see now
that a TEMPLAR CROSS has been hewn out of the ancient stone

They all exchange knowing looks

of the stone crypt Ben smiles

He moves to the crypt The shadow falls in the direct
center Riley laughs excitedly

RILEY

Ben kneels beside the worn crypt Feels carefully along
the surface as if reading Braille He stops Digs out
some soft dirt revealing what looks to be

A SMALL KEYHOLE

Abigail eyes the pipe

Ben SLAMS the pipe against the stone It SHATTERS revealing
a THIN SKELETON KEY that was hidden inside

National Treasure 4903 112 338

Ben scoops up the key and slips it into the key hole A
perfect fit He looks to the others who all stand by
anxiously then TURNS THE KEY

Suddenly there is a loud SCRAPING SOUND as a two-foot thick
section of the crypts lid SLIDES OPEN on a ancient pulley
system As it opens we can see

A NARROW PASSAGE Barely wide enough for one person to
squeeze through A very dark

They all exchange a look And cant help but smile at their
sudden success Ian looks to Riley

IAN

RILEY
No way The guy who goes first
always gets killed

in front of Rileys face He SCREAMS

Ben shines his flashlight upwards to see

HUNDREDS OF GRINNING SKULLS half buried in the dirt ceiling
peering down at them The remnants of uniforms boots and
brass buttons can be seen

British during the Revolution
They were buried in a common grave

Shaw looks up Just above him there is a gun and flintlock
powder horn in a dead soldiers belt

There must be another outlet
Something we missed Come on

They all turn to go but Shaw hangs back He reaches up to
the gun and tries to take it but its stuck

As Shaw yanks harder bits of dirt and dust rain down on
him Suddenly

A BAYONETED RIFLE SWINGS out of the ceiling like a pendulum
attached to a skeletons arm and

-STABS SHAW in the chest

The group turns and sees Shaw as he staggers back with the

rifle stuck in his chest Ben goes to help him but Shaw
crashes into

The dirt wall behind him which caves in under his weight

Shaw falls through the hole in the wall screaming all the

way down Which sounds like a long way down

The group rushes to the hole in the wall and shine their
lights into it revealing

A DEEP NARROW SHAFT in the wall In the shaft there hangs
two heavy chains with weights attached

IAN (CONTD)
Well that was fortunate now wasnt
it
Ben reaches into the shaft and adjusts the weights on the
chains The chains CREAK as an ancient WOODEN BOX descends
into view from higher in the shaft
Ben and Abigail exchange a look

ABIGAIL
It looks like an elevator

Ben and Riley pry open the door on the box and a MILLION
RATS and COCKROACHES pour out from the elevator cab They
all gulp staring at the vermin A beat then

Ben steps inside The elevator CREAKS and GROANS but holds

Sadusky looks at Agent Dawes and realizes shes right
SADUSKY

INT UNDERGROUND ELEVATOR CAGE - NIGHT 348

All eyes look around warily as the cab descends creakily
into depths unknown Deeperdeeper still

RILEY
I just want to point our that there
are no buttons on the panel In

fact there is no panel Hows this
thing going to take us back up

BEN
Its a one-way elevator

RILEY
Then its not an elevator is it
Because it doesnt elevate

Suddenly the cab STOPS Theyve hit something WATER
rushes in at their feet filling the cab up to their ankles

Riley and Ian pull open the wooden elevator door and more
water RUSHES IN

INT UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 349
They shine their lights into the room The chamber is

circular and there is a STONE PLATFORM in the center

Three 14th Century SWORDS jut out of the stone platform in

a crisscross formation

BEN
Templar Swords

Ian moves to the platform followed by Ben and Abigail

Riley slogs out last He steps something which CRUNCHES
under his foot Riley looks down to find
National Treasure 4903 117

-a SKELETON

RILEY
I knew it
(sing-song)
Its a trap

Riley starts searching the walls for a way out while Ian
Ben and Abigail study the swords

ABIGAIL
What do they mean

Ian reaches for one of the swords

BEN
Ian I wouldnt--

But Ian does anyway He pulls out the center sword We
immediately hear the RUSHING SOUND OF WATER Everyone looks
around The sound is all around them

RILEY
Whats that

But Ian doesnt care He just studies the sword Riley
continues feeling the walls but can find no exit

RILEY (CONTD)
Howre we supposed to get out of
here

BEN
Look at this

Ben shines his light on the side of the platform to see a
bas relief a SNAKE CUT INTO PIECES carved into the stone

Abigail immediately recognizes the severed snake symbol

ABIGAIL
Join or die

RILEY
I say we join

Ben kneels down to study a STONE SLOT in a CIRCULAR STONE
at a vertex of a triangle etched into the floor

BEN
When we were at war with France
Ben Franklin drew a political cartoon
of a snake cut into eight pieces
representing the eight colonies at
the time The cartoon called the
colonies to Join or Die

National Treasure 4903 118 349

The sound of the rushing water intensifies as Ben notices
two more slots in the floor at the triangles other vertices

RILEY
But what does that mean

Now the sound of the RUSHING WATER builds to a CRESCENDO
and suddenly WATER VOMITS into the chamber from several
ancient drains in the walls near the ceiling

The force of the thundering cascade knocks all of them off
their feet Ian drops his sword but more importantly

-HE DROPS THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE INTO THE WATER

Water also pours into the chamber from the elevator shaft
Before anyone can react the chamber is already filled up
to their chests

Abigail and Ben both see the Declaration of Independence in
its tube bobbing around in the churning water

Ben frantically swims to it but it slips awayjust out
of his reach

ABIGAIL
I got it

The tube floats to Abigail She scoops it out of the water
then holds it over her head as the water swirls around her

The chamber is filling quickly and its now mostly dark
except for the faint glow of the submerged flashlights

Everyone claws at the walls finding no purchase in the
smooth stone Ben calls over the din of the rushing water

BEN
Listen We have to work together
Join or die

RILEY
How

BEN
There is a triangle carved into the
floor At each vertex there is a
slot We must get the swords then
each of us must stick them in the
slots and turn the swords All of
us together

Riley regards Ben for a long beat then

RILEY
Are you out of your mind

Ben answers by disappearing under the waters surface

National Treasure 4903 119 349

Riley and Abigail exchange a look Then Riley looks up
The flat stone ceiling is only a few feet overhead now
Theyll soon be drowned Riley takes a deep breath then
dives down

UNDERWATER Ben dives down to the platform The two 350
remaining SWORDS are still sticking up out of it He grabs

one Riley swims up behind him and grabs the other They

both then kick back toward the surface

IN THE CHAMBER Ben and Riley resurface with the swords 351
gasping for breath Ben hands Ian the sword

BEN
Find the slot At the triangles
vertex

The stone walls suddenly GROAN under the tons of pressure

BEN (CONTD)
Go

All three disappear underwater leaving Abigail holding
the Declaration up high but the water is rising rapidly

EXT TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT 352

WORKERS finally jackhammer through the crypt wall and
Sadusky peers inside

INT UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 353

Abigail still holds the Declaration of Independence above
her head but there is less than a foot of space left now

UNDERWATER Riley and Ian dive down feel the floor find 354
edges of the triangle and follow them BEN also feels the
floor searching for the sword

IN THE CHAMBER Only inches of space left now Abigail 355
presses the Declaration of Independence and her face

against the ceiling in the cramped pocket of air

UNDERWATER Ian follows his edge Finds the vertex slot 356
Shoves his sword into it Turns it

RILEY finds his vertex and does the same

BEN finally finds the sword

IN THE CHAMBER Abigail and the Declaration of 357
Independence are now completely submerged There is no air

pocket anymore

UNDERWATER Ben finds the third vertex plunges the sword 358
into the slot and

-TURNS IT

National Treasure 4903 120

ON ABIGAIL Suddenly the chamber ceiling RUMBLES as the 359
heavy stone ceiling slabs START SLIDING APART

CUT TO - PITCH BACK We hear the SCRAPING SOUND of the 360
stone floor rolling open As it does the faintest glimmer
of light peeks up from the submerged flashlights below

A beat then Abigails hand POKES UP THROUGH THE CRACK in
the floor holding the Declaration of Independence

She tosses it aside onto the dry floor then pulls herself
up through the opening

Ian pulls himself up through the floor next then rolls
aside gasping for air in a soggy heap

INT UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS OSSUARY - NIGHT 361
Sadusky and his team sprint down the passageway and come to

the grave room Only now the elevator shaft is COMPLETELY
FLOODED

The elevator chains disappear into a pool of water which
spills into the ossuary

SADUSKY
Theres got to be another way down
Find it
INT UNDERGROUND TREASURE CHAMBER - NIGHT 362

The water gurgles up through the widening crack in the floor
Abigail waits by it A beat then Riley surfaces coughing

ABIGAIL
Wheres Ben

Ian catches his breath then peers into the darkness In
the near distance we can see somethingGLIMMERING

Suddenly the floor starts rumbling closed again Panicked
Abigail calls out

ABIGAIL (CONTD)
Ben Ben

Ian picks up the Declaration of Independence which lies on
the stone floor near him

Just then Ben comes up gasping for air choking on
swallowed water butholding a flashlight

BEN
(between coughs)
I thought we might need this

The flashlight beam cuts through the darkness We catch
glimpses of pillars statues stone steps
National Treasure 4903 121
362 362

RILEY
Is that

The beam of light stops on something very shiny Its a
three-tiered bronze-gilded altar The very sight of it
makes Abigail gasp Ian stares at it mesmerized

IAN
-An altar of bronze twenty cubits
long and twenty cubits wide
Second Book of Chronicles

Ian and Ben exchange knowing looks

BEN

Stolen from the Temple of Solomon
in the 5th Century BC

The group moves to the altar where they find candles and
torches They quickly light them then turn to see

THE TREASURE CHAMBER

Dozens of marble Doric and Corinthian columns line the walls
of the cavernous chamber filled with ancient treasures

Crown jewels gold and silver plates and chalices gilded
cherubim olivewood furniture carriages loot from the
Oracle of Delphi and countless sacred artifacts

ABIGAIL
This is what it must have been like
to find King Tuts Tomb

RILEY
Dont say that Those guys were
cursed

Ian starts moving through the chamber in awe of its
treasures But Ben doesnt move He just stands there

BEN
Well be taking the Declaration of
Independence now Ian

Ian finds a chest opens itits filled with ancient Greek
and Roman coins

IAN
Oh come on Ben Have some fun

Ian moves past the chest and Riley cant help himself He
goes to it sticks his hand in it and comes up with a
handful of coins He laughs incredulous

BEN
A deals a deal Ian
National Treasure 4903 122
362 362

But Ian isnt listening Hes found another ANCIENT SWORD
only this one is differentspecial

Its silver handle is decorated with images of scythed
chariots engaged in battle and the famous Macedonian King

Riley steps up behind Ian He sees the sword

RILEY
Cool gothic sword

IAN
Its not just any sword

Ian picks it up Its heavy Weighs more than 30 pounds

IAN (CONTD)
-Its the sword of Alexander the
Great

As Ian holds up the sword we notice that it almost GLISTENS
with an ethereal power

IAN (CONTD)
--It was used to conquer the world

Without warning Ian swings the sword backwards under his
arm in a rowing motion and

-Plunges it into RILEYS STOMACH
Riley staggers back stunned Then he collapses

Shocked and horrified Ben and Abigail rush to Riley Hes
bleeding Badly

BEN
Riley Oh Jesus

Ben takes off his shirt Balls it up Presses it on Rileys
wound Abigail helps Ben hold it there Riley looks up to
Ben He knows its bad He grimaces in agony

RILEY
At least I was rich before I died

With that Ian swings his sword at Ben who just barely rolls
out of the way it time The sword hits the stone floor
with a loud CLANK taking out divot of stone

IAN
You couldnt just want the treasure
now could you Ben

Ian swings again but Ben grabs a bronze plate and blocks
the blow SPARKS fly as the plate shatters
National Treasure 4903 123
362 362

IAN (CONTD)
You couldnt just be reasonable and
argue with me over shares I say
How about 70-30 And then you
say How about 60-40 And then I
say What about 80-20

Ben scrambles to his feet and Ian chases him

IAN (CONTD)
No you have to go and be all noble

He swings the sword at Ben again but Ben dives behind a
suit of armor which Ian SMASHES with his sword

Ben goes down with the medieval suit which clatters to the
ground Ben shoulder-rolls to his feet and comes up with a
sword of his own

They face off En Guard They circle each other

IAN (CONTD)
I dont trust honest men

Ian strikes Ben parries Their swords cross with a loud
CLANK They push off each other and then the duel begins
in earnest

Actually its more like two guys fighting a bar fight with
heavy swords Neither is trained in fencing but neither
is about to give up first

They exchange blows in an exhausting Rob Roy-esque sword
fight Ian attacks Ben parries and simultaneously delivers
a brutal kick to Ians ribs staggering Ian

The Declaration of Independence falls to the ground and
rolls away down some stone steps

Angered Ian winds up Strikes a vicious blow Ben deflects
it with his sword which breaks in half The other half
clanks to the ground

ON ABIGAIL Shes applying pressure to Rileys wound She
sees the Declaration of Independence rolling toward a slatted
drain in the floor

She grabs Rileys hands and puts them on the now bloody
balled up shirt

ABIGAIL
Apply pressure

Riley weakly holds onto the field dressing as

Abigail hurries to the still rolling Declaration of
Independence which is almost to the drain
National Treasure 4903 124
362 362

Abigail DIVES FOR ITbut just misses it The Declaration
of Independence slips through the slats and DISAPPEARS DOWN
THE DRAIN

ON IAN and BEN Ian swings Ben ducks and dodges but
Ians sword catches pieces of him Slices into Bens
shoulder And his chest

ON ABIGAIL She sticks her hand into the drain

INSIDE THE DRAIN The Declaration of Independence is stuck
way down deep in the drain where the drain narrows

Abigails hand reaches down for the tube but itsjust
outofreach

ON BEN and IAN Bloodied Ben hurls the broken sword at
Ian who deflects it and charges Ben

Ben scrambles over the treasure pile improvising grabbing
whatever he can to parry Ians blows A chaliceCLANK
An urnwhich shatters

Ben grabs an alabaster cherubim He holds it up to deflect
a blow but notices that its just too beautiful to ruin
Ben sets it back down then dives behind a PILLAR just as

Ian swings again striking the pillar insteadWHAM Chunks
of marble fly

Ian circles around the pillar chasing the wounded Ben with
his sword Ian swings and Ben ducks This time Ians
sword gets STUCK in the pillar

As Ian tries to extricate it

Ben pushes a Greek limestone statue But its heavy It
teetersfinally tips

Ian turns just in time to see the statue about to crush
him CRASH

But it doesnt crush Ian The statue instead crashes into
the pillar leaving just enough space to save Ian

Ian grabs the sword yanks it out

Bad idea The pillar gives way and the statue finishes
its fall smashing down on Ian Killing him instantly

And tearing a hole in the stone wall behind him Water
GUSHES IN from the hole Its the elevator shaft

As the water rushes in the whole treasure chamber begins
to rumble Pieces of the stone ceiling start to fall
crashing down all around

Ben looks to see Abigail still struggling with the drain

National Treasure 4903 125 362

ON ABIGAIL Shes got her whole arm in the drain but she
still cant reach the Declaration of Independence Rocks
and debris rains down all around her

BEN (0S)
Look out

Abigail pulls her hand out of the drain Turns to see Ben
holding the Sword of Alexander up high He swings it down
SMASHING the drain open

Abigail quickly reaches in and pulls out the Declaration of
Independence

They hurry to Riley Everything is shaking falling apart

RILEY
(weakly)
The treasure rooms caving in
BEN
We know
RILEY

That always happens

Ben and Abigail grab Riley under his arms and help him to
the pillar thats crashed through the wall The water has
leveled off in the shaft

INT UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS SHAFT - NIGHT 363

Ben and Abigail peer into the shaft The two chains
disappear into the water below

BEN
We have to get in the water

ABIGAIL
(to Riley)
Can you swim

RILEY
Do I have a choice

As everything in the treasure chamber collapses behind them
Ben pushes Riley into the water and jumps in after him

Abigail follows then Ben swings the sword and cuts one of
the chains The elevator shoots out of the depths catching
Ben Abigail and Riley and carrying them up the shaft

INT UNDERGROUND CATACOMBS OSSUARY - NIGHT 364
The three roll off the roof of the charging elevator and

spill out onto the ossuary floor as the elevator disappears
up into the shaft with the sword

National Treasure 4903 126

Abigail lands on Ben They regard each other Surprised
to be alive Dust and debris settle in the room

Riley lies in the dirt staring up at the hundreds of
grinning skulls looking down on him

RILEY
Are we dead

EXT TRINITY CHURCH GRAVEYARD - NIGHT
Sadusky his team and dozens of POLICE are here
BEN (0S)

Hey can we get a little help over

here
Sadusky turns to see Ben and Abigail helping Riley out of
the crypt stairwell In an instant a swarm of federal
agents and police are on them
EXT TRINITY CHURCH BROADWAY - NIGHT
Sadusky hands the Declaration of Independence over to an
armored transport which pulls away with an escort of a
dozen police cars

Saduskys team Ben and Abigail stand nearby with two EMTs
who load Riley onto an ambulance

EMT
(to Ben)
He lost a lot of blood but hes
going to be fine

Now Sadusky approaches

SADUSKY
OK guys lets go

The federal agents all start to leave Ben and Abigail
look at each other confused

BEN
Arent you going to arrest us

SADUSKY
What for You do something wrong

Ben and Abigail exchange a look like nookaygobye
Sadusky grins at them then heads to his sedan

SADUSKY (CONTD)
You kids need a ride

Ben and Abigail smile at each other

National Treasure 4903 127

BEN
No thanks Well walk

SADUSKY
All right Good night

CLOSE ON Saduskys hand as he climbs into his car On his
finger we now see that he wears a SILVER MASONIC RING
just like the one Charles Carroll and Count Pulaski wore

As Sadusky drives away Ben and Abigail look back to the
Trinity Church graveyard

BEN
Too bad no one will ever know

ABIGAIL
Well know

With that she kisses Ben A long deep kiss Then
suddenly Ben pulls away

BEN
Just tell me one thing Does this
kiss mean anything

Abigail considers that then

ABIGAIL
Only time will tell

With that they kiss some more as we PULL BACK as the federal

agents all get in their cars and leave
