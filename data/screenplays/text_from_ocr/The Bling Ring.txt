1 EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS MANSION - NIGHT

A Toyota parks and five teenagers get out and walk towards
us down a quiet residential street in the Hollywood Hills

One of them a slightly drunk girl in a pale blue Juicy sweat
suit stumbles

DRUNK GIRL (NICKI)
(laughing)
Shit

GIRL 1 (REBECCA)
Cmon Hurry up

They come to a gated home A girl that seems to be the
leader leans down and pulls on an unraveling part of the
bottom of the chain link fence

She rolls under and the others follow

A loud song kicks in as they put their sweatshirt hoods up in
unison and turn around and walk backwards toward the house

Theyve done this before they have it down
One checks under the mat of the front door we follow them as
they go around to the back checking doors and find a back
window open

A guy gives Girl 1 a lift up we see her bright underwear as
she climbs inside into a laundry room

She runs around to open a side door for the rest and they
slip inside
Once inside we follow REBECCA into a bedroom dressing area
She is the 17 yr-old Korean-American ring-leader who is
totally cool and composed

She looks over her shoulder at the others with a raised eye-
brow

REBECCA
Lets go shopping

And she pulls open the closet door
CLOSE UP grabbing Louis Vuitton bags

A drawer opens with a few Rolexes that are scooped in to a
Louis Vuitton duffle bag

An underwear drawer is opened and picked through

A medicine cabinet is opened a hand grabs bottles of
prescription pills and dumps them in a bag

We see the other kids grabbing things and loading up bags

Rebecca puts on a hat she finds and looks at herself in a
mirror posing then gets back to it

teenagers and news clips

We see a clip of black and white video surveillance of the
kids approach to the house walking backwards with hoods up
Pan across a row of Louboutin platform heels

We see the glittery view of Hollywood at night

CLOSE UP a Facebook page of a party photo of Rebecca in the
hat we saw her try on earlier

Pan across a pile of quilted Chanel bags

TV image of a starlet on the red carpet posing for
pictures

CLOSE UP on a stack of shiny diamond necklaces

Were you nervous you were next to

Yeah it was hard for me there were
tabloids and on TVs in there
people were watching the story and
they were showing the surveillance

came out I was actually in contact
with her manager to tell her who I
believed the people were who robbed
