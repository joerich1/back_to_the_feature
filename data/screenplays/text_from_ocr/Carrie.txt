FADE UP ON

PROLOGUE INTEXT MARGARET WHITE’S HOUSE - THE PAST
A balmy August day in Maine

A white wooden house at the end of a country lane Ancient
New England trees in the yard Wind in the trees leaves The
branches swaying A sense of the Natural World The Eternal
We hear VOICES SINGING

VOICES
Blessed be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like that to that above”

The camera pans across the house Through its windows we see
MEMBERS OF A FUNDAMENTALIST SECT gathered to worship
singing a hymn An imposing woman MARGARET WHITE stands in
front of a makeshift altar leading them

WORSHIPERS
“Before our Fathers throne We
pour our ardent prayers Our fears
our hopes our aims are one Our
comforts and our cares

EXT MARGARET WHITE’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The camera finds Margarets five-year-old shy daughter
CARRIE creeping towards the fence that separates the White
property from the next-door neighbors yard On the other
side of the fence a ripe 18-year-old girl ESTELLE HORAN
sunbathes on a towel in a white bikini dozing

INT WHITE COMMISSION CONFERENCE ROOM - PRESENT DAY

Bikini girl is now a conservative woman of 30 sitting at a
conference table in front of a microphone Being interviewed
by someone off-camera Across the bottom of the screen the
words “WHITE COMMISSION - ESTELLE HORAN (NEIGHBOR) ”

Behind Margaret some members of the sect have gathered in
the doorway at the windows Margaret grabs Carries arm and

YANKS her away from Estelle towards their house

MARGARET

More worshipers have come out of Margarets house Estelles

MOTHER comes out of their house afraid someones being

THE CACOPHONY BUILDS with Margaret Estelle and Estelles
mother all yelling the worshippers staring Carrie WAILING
as Margaret drags her back towards the house--

INT WHITE COMMISSION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

ESTELLE HORAN
(matter-of-factly)
Thats when they started to fall
Out of the sky

EXT THE BACKYARDS - DAY

Something--A PEBBLE--falls from the sky and hits the White
roof bouncing off it Then another one Margaret stops
shaking Carrie looks up A third rock hits the back steps

ESTELLE’S MOTHER
(with dread)
Estelle get over here--now

Estelle races to her mother as more stones--like big pieces
of hail--continue to fall all over the White backyard One
member of the sect CROSSES himself Margaret kneels in front
of her sobbing hysterical daughter

MARGARET
Stop it girl You stop it right
now

But Carrie cant More stones Estelle and her mother cower
under their back porch for cover butthe stones are only
falling on the White property

In a panic Margaret takes the girl up in her arms but their
house is too far away to get to safely
So to shield Carrie from the falling stones Margaret
HUDDLES against one of the oak trees in the backyard as the
storm of stones continues One smashes through the roof
another hits and dislodges the drainpipe The members of the
sect are terrified this is a true sign of the devil
Margaret strokes her daughter’s hair trying to calm and
comfort her

MARGARET (CONTD)
Its all right its all right
Carrie Shhh-shhh He forgives
you Jesus forgives you shhh-
shhbh

But its no use This is an Act of God now

INT WHITE COMMISSION CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
Estelles interview continues

ESTELLE HORAN
Two things happened after that day
The first is I never sunbathed in
the backyard again And two those
church people stopped coming over
to pray and sing andwhatever It
was just Margaret and Carrie then
in their house doing their thing

The interviewer asks Estelle a question

ESTELLE HORAN (CONT’D)
Sure Ive wondered over the years
About what had happened to Carrie
White and her crazy mother Now I
suppose the whole world knows

McCDUFFY (AUTHOR TELEKINESIS A SCIENTIFIC BASIS)
MCDUFFY
Apart from the stones there is no
other recorded instance of TK in
Carrie White’s childhood Of
course since Carrie was an only
child the best witness to such
manifestations would have been her
mother Margaret White

INT GIRLS’ LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Amidst a sea of bodies naked and half-clad girls Sue and
two of her girlfriends NICKI and HEATHER are in towels
post- showering combing out their hair

MCDUFFY (VO)
Moreover it is entirely possible
that Carrie’s talent was latent
awakened by the trauma and stress
she experienced last May

HEATHER

-finally I was like “Either
were going Brian or I’m asking
the Beak Because I am not missing
my prom because you can’t get your
shit together” And Brian was like
Fine Heather buy the tickets”
And I was like “Thank you I will
why was that so friggin’ hard”

NICKI
(to Sue)
What about you guys

SUE
Tommy hasn’t asked me yet--

NICKI

SUE
Why does everyone care so much
It’s just a dance

Nicki and Heather look at each other

NICKI
A) It’s prom--

Suddenly A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM from the other side of the
lockers

As Desjardin forces her way through the gaggle of girls--

MS DESJARDIN
What the hell is going on here

Desjardin stops cold when she sees Carrie--

They leave as Desjardin helps Carrie from the shower room
towards the lockers

INT WHITE COMMISSION - RITA DESJARDIN - DAY
Desjardin at the table

MS DESJARDIN
The question I’m asked over and
over “How could Carrie not have
known about her period” To which I
answer “If you’d ever met Margaret
White” You have to understand
This is a woman who lived ina
house with no television no
computer no internet nothing Who
forbade her daughter from having
friends

INT WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

PRINCIPAL MORTONs secretary MISS FINCH sits behind her
desk Carrie clutching her books to her chest like a shield

HARRY TRENNANT sit nearby waiting for their turn to be
sentenced by Morton Greg whispers to

GREG
Carrie Hey Carrie Look at me
Come on pleeease Look at me Just

Finally Carrie looks his way Greg mimes her giving hima
blowjob Harry SNIGGERS Carrie who isnt even sure what the
gesture means quickly looks away--

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

Inside the office PRINCIPAL MORTON is getting a cup of water
for Desjardin (as they debrief) from A WATER COOLER’S HALF-
FULL GLASS TANK

MORTON
Isn’t she a bit old for

MS DESJARDIN
Her first period Or the fact that
she didn’t even know such a thing
existed until half an hour ago

Morton goes to offer her the cup finds himself staring at
the BLOODY HANDPRINT Carrie left on Desjardin’s shorts

MORTON
Well We can’t interfere with
people’s beliefs but that
mother

MS DESJARDIN
I called to tell her what happened
She barely said two words to me
Blames me I’m sure and the truth
isI handled it badly Henry

MORTON
My last run-in with Margaret White
was when she told Mrs Bicente that
the Lord was reserving a special
place in hell for her

MS DESJARDIN
For Janice Why

MORTON
She’d given Cassie an article about
Charles Darwin

MS DESJARDIN
(beat)
It’s Carrie We should send her
home

MORTON
Of course
(buzzing his secretary)
Miss Finch would you send her in
(to DESJARDIN)
What about the other girls Do you
have their names

MS DESJARDIN
It was all of them Henry

MORTON
These kids After twenty years
their faces blur into one and all
your remember is how awful they
are
(looking at her)
Come in Cassie

MS DESJARDIN
(whispering to him)
Carrie

Carrie creeps into the office Miss Finch is in the doorway

MORTON
Would you prepare a dismissal slip
Miss Fish Cassie White

Carrie flinches at this a bit--and a SPIDER-CRACK appears in
the water cooler

MORTON (CONTD)
Ms Desjardin and I think it best
that you go home andtake care of
yourself

Carrie nods

MORTON (CONTD)
Unless youd like to go to the
infirmary

Carrie shakes her head

MS DESJARDIN
She should go home And Carrie
youre excused from PE for the
rest of the week Just take study
hall instead The library okay

Carrie nods
MORTON
Would you like us to call you a
cab Cassie

Another CRACK in the cooler

MS DESJARDIN
Carrie can walk home--

It’s just to Carlin Street
Miss Finch returns with a dismissal slip Carrie takes it

CARRIE
(barely audible)
They threw things at me

MS DESJARDIN
It won’t happen again

CARRIE
(finally looking up)
They laughed at me Why do they
always laugh at me

MORTON
Were so sorry about this Cassie

CARRIE
Thats not my name

The water cooler SHATTERS spilling water all over the floor
Carrie grabs the slip from Finch and bolts from the office--

iPod buds in his ears

He sees Carrie brightens and cuts across the street so
that now he’s behind Carrie coming up on her fast As he
passes her

JERRY
Crazy Carrie Crazy Carrie Crazy
Carrie--

Close-up on Carrie Anger flashes across her face her brow
furrows she flexes--and Jerry WIPES OUT a tangle of arms
and legs and still-spinning bicycle wheels The boy SCREAMS
as Carrie hurries along a smile blossoming on her face

She goes around the block stops Realizes what she’s done
the smile fades She looks at the trees above her branches
swaying as if pushed by God’s hand

SUE (VO)
I never set foot inside Carrie’s
house None of us did not even
when we were kids

Carrie resumes her walk

INT SUE’S BEDROOM - VIDEO DIARY - THE PRESENT LOOKING BACK

EXT CARLIN STREET - CARRIE’S HOUSE - DAY

continues

SUE (V0O)
It was like some fairy tale The
lonely girl trapped in the tower
with only her evil step-mother to
keep her company

INT CARRIE’S HOUSE - FRONT HALL - DAY

Carrie enters her severe masculine home (It is part church
part house of horrors) Decorated with RELIGIOUS ART AND
ARTIFACTS all accentuating the suffering of the Whites very
private faith The first thing you see upon entering A
GIANT WOODEN CRUCIFIX

Then statues of lanced and pierced saints many topped with
crowns of thorns portraits showcasing the anguish of Mary

etc A tapestry depicting Abraham about to sacrifice his son
Isaac

The camera follows Carrie as she walks passed the vaulted
doorway that leads from the entrance hall to the White
livingdining room Empty Carrie hangs her sweater in the
closet walks passed the doorway again--only Margaret White
is there now having entered from the kitchen

MARGARET
(stoney )
So you’re a woman now

INT CARRIE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Timidly Carrie approaches Margaret

CARRIE
Diddid the school call you
Momma

MARGARET
They did And can you imagine my
shame

CARRIE

Oh Momma why didn’t you tell me
I was so scared I thought I was
dying And the other girls they
laughed at me and threw things at

me--
MARGARET
Why were you showering with them
Carrie
CARRIE

Momma it was after gym class
everyone showers--

MARGARET
Not you It’s forbidden and a sin
Carrie You’re--
(the dirty truth)
--full of sin now

Margaret turns from Carrie takes a BIBLE up off the dining
room table Opens to a passage reads

MARGARET (CONTD)
“And God made Eve from the rib of

Adam and-- Say it Carrie
CARRIE
Momma talk to me Please--just
talk to me
MARGARET

“And God made Eve from the rib of
Adam and”--what Carrie Say it

CARRIE
Momma please--

Margaret lashes out STRIKES Carrie across the face with the
bible The girl crumbles to her knees

MARGARET
“--and Eve was weak” say it
Woman Say it

CARRIE
I wont

Margaret hits Carrie again Fine so Margaret will say it

MARGARET
“And Eve was weak and loosed the
Raven on the world and the Raven
was called Sin and the first Sin
was Intercourse--”

CARRIE
(pleading)
I didn’t do anything--

MARGARET
“And the Lord visited Eve with a
Curse and the Curse was the Curse
of Blood--”

CARRIE
It wasn’t my fault--

MARGARET

It was Carrie it was--

(beat)
“And Adam and Eve were driven out
of the Garden and into the World
and Eve found that her belly had
grown big with child”--and that
Carrie that is the second Curse
the Curse of Childbearing--

CARRIE
Momma you should have told me I
don’t know anything because of
you

Margaret drops to her knees and clutches her daughter--

MARGARET
Oh Lord help this sinning woman
see the sin of her ways Show her
that if she’d remained sinless the
Curse of Blood would not have come
upon her as it did Eve

CARRIE
I’m not Eve Momma I didn’t sin--

MARGARET
You showered with the other girls
You have lust-filled thoughts I
know you do You have been tempted
by the Anti-Christ Carrie the
world is wicked and this is the
Lords kind vengeful hand at work--

CARRIE
Let go of me Momma

MARGARET
You stink of sin Carrie I can
smell it on you--

CARRIE
I mean it Momma let me go--

MARGARET
Eve never repented so on her the
Crafty Serpent built a Kingdom of
Whores and Pestilences But you’1l
repent You’ll go to your closet--

CARRIE
No--

MARGARET
You’1ll pray--we’ll pray together--
to Jesus to save our sinning souls--

CARRIE
Let me go Momma or Ill make the
stones come again--

Margaret freezes The first time Carrie’s invoked the stones

CARRIE (CONTD)
I didn’t sin Momma You sinned
You didn’t tell me and and they
laughed

For a moment Margaret pauses she almost hears this But
then very quickly her righteous rage returns

MARGARET
Daughter of the devil--

Margaret starts dragging a kicking and screaming Carrie into
the kitchen towards a closet--

CARRIE
MOMMA NO NO

MARGARET
PRAY PRAY IN SHAME PRAY FOR
FORGIVENESS THOU SHALT HONOR THY
MOTHER AND FATHER

CARRIE
MOMMA WHY WHY

Margaret throws open the closet door Carrie is fighting for
her life--

CARRIE (CONT’D)
Momma i

Margaret drags Carrie into the closet--

MARGARET
Sin Oh Sin

Margaret emerges from the closet SLAMS the door shut behind
her trapping Carrie just as Carrie shrieks--

CARRIE (0C)
MOMMA YOU SUCK

A GIANT CRACK APPEARS DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOOR as if it
has just been hit by an enormous battering ram This stops
everything Shocks both women Margaret covers her mouth with
her hand backs away from the closet door--

INT CARRIE’S HOUSE - THE CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

Carrie stares at the crack more freaked than Margaret She
kneels down crosses herself starts to pray

Stops lights a candle illuminating THE SCARY PAINTING that
looms over her God the Vengeful Father sits in a throne
above the Earth with sinners falling into Hell where a goat-
like Devil rules over the burning pits Shadowy demons
dragging the sinners down

Carrie takes comfort in the Lords prayer

CARRIE
“Our Father who art in Heaven
hallowed be Thy name Thy kingdom
come Thy will be done on Earth
as it is inin”

Carrie is crying now This can’t be her life A moment of
utter heart-break and vulnerability

terrorize Chris One more mumbled
remark and you’1ll see how not
terrorized by you I am

Chris doesn’t say anything

MS DESJARDIN (CONT’D)
Now my recommendation to Mr Morton
for this little stunt of yours was
three days’ suspension and no prom

A collective GASP from the girls

MS DESJARDIN (CONT’D)
That would’ve hit you were it
hurts And you would’ve deserved
it too However because the
Disciplinary Committee is made-up
almost entirely of men and they
of course have no idea how truly
nasty what you did is their
punishment is one week’s detention

The girls Sue included sigh in relief Chris smiles tries
to catch Sue’s eye Sue looks away

MS DESJARDIN (CONT’D)
Ah but its to be my detention
You just got a taste Every day
this week for an hour and a half

CHRIS
(mumbles )
Im not coming

MS DESJARDIN
That’s up to you Chris That’s up
to each of you But skipping
detention gets you three days’
suspension and no prom

CHRIS
My fathers a lawyer Take away my
prom and hell sue you bitch

The girls are shocked not even Chris has ever talked to a
teacher like that Desjardin strides up to the girl A scary
moment Is Desjardin going to hit Chris But then

MS DESJARDIN

The students brace themselves--

ULMANN

TOMMY
I have baseball practice sir And
my coach would have a strong
opinion about me missing it

Rather than push this conflict further Ulmann lets it go

WINK Sue is still looking at Tommy impressed when

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

A tense meeting Principal Morton (fiddling with a series of
paperclips)and Ms Desjardin are facing off against Chriss
father the lawyer JOHN HARGENSEN

JOHN HARGENSEN
My daughter’s at home right now
Ill keep her there throughlet’s
say Thursday That’s a three-day
suspension Long enough

MS DESJARDIN
(incredulous)
For what Chris did to Carrie And
how she literally disrespects
everyone

JOHN HARGENSEN

(ignoring Desjardin)
Once she’s completed her
suspension I want my daughter’s
prom privileges re-instated A
girl’s prom is extremely important
to her and Chris is very
distressed to be missing hers

MS DESJARDIN
She had every opportunity to--

JOHN HARGENSEN
--prom is what I want for my
daughter Mr Morton What I want
for me is--
(he turns to Desjardin)
--her dismissal

MORTON
On what grounds
JOHN HARGENSEN
She threatened my daughter with
physical abuse and used profanity
in front of her That’s verbal
abuse

MS DESJARDIN
Oh that’s such--

MORTON
--Ms Desjardin has been
reprimanded but Mr Hargensen you
are aware of what your daughter did
to her classmate Carrie White

JOHN HARGENSEN
Not even remotely relevant

MORTON
It’s absolutely relevant sir
because your daughter and her posse
threw sanitary napkins at Carrie
White And chanted “Plug it up”
That’s verbal abuse too And made
obscene gestures towards the girl--
who incidentally believed she was
bleeding to death

JOHN HARGENSEN
If you’d rather we continue this
conversation in court Mr Morton--

MORTON
We absolutely can Mr Hargensen--

Morton opens a thick file sitting on his desk--

MORTON (CONTD)
--but first may I show you
something sir

JOHN HARGENSEN
Chris’s file

MORTON
(nodding)
In her four years here she’s
earned72 detentions 48 of those
are for the systematic abuse and
harassing of misfit pupils

MS DESJARDIN
(sneaking it in)
Eileen Swope

Hargensen

JOHN HARGENSEN
(finally talking to her)
What

MORTON
I believe Ms Desjardin is
referring to the girl your daughter
systematically tormented for two
years-- Sending her threatening e-
mails posting humiliating photos--

MS DESJARDIN
Because Eileen was voted Treasurer
over Chris--

MORTON
--Eileen tried to kill herself you
might recall That case almost went
to court but you settled with her
family I believe Is that right

JOHN HARGENSEN
Your teacher crossed a line
Morton if you don’t make it right
I will take you to court and when
I’m through with you you won’t be
fit to get a job as a custodian

MORTON

(pleasantly)
Ewen High has zero tolerance for
this behavior Mr Hargensen
Therefore the sanctions against
your daughter stand If you wish to
pursue the matter further that is
your right But if sued we will
counter-sue on behalf of Carrie
White on the grounds of physical
verbal and mental abuse Now I
believe you know the way out sir

stands leaves without uttering another word

MS DESJARDIN
Now we know where she gets it

MORTON

paperclip)

MARGARET
“I adjure you ancient serpent by
the judge of the living and the
dead by your Creator by the

Exhausted heart-broken (but ever the dutiful daughter)
Carrie stands and starts cleaning the mess she just made

As they reach the double-doors that lead into the gymnasium
proper Tommy takes Carries arm and sweeps her into

INT EWEN HIGH’S GYM - NIGHT

From Carries POV The gym has been completely transformed
In a cheesy (but great) way it does look like 18th-century
Venice The streamers the colored lights the mural the
decorations the table-clothes the dresses the tuxedoes
everythingits all magical A true fairy-tale

NOTE Two BIG SCREENS on either side of the stage display a
sort of VIDEO YEARBOOK a slideshow of photographs from the
entire school year Students clubs memories--appearing for
a moment then dissolving into the next slide THE BAND is
playing a few students are dancing Everyone’s having a
blast

The camera sweeps across the gym then back to findCarrie
and Tommy still at those double-doors drinking it all in

TOMMY

at the dance-floor Tommy notices A PICTURE OF HIM AND SUE on
the video screens flanking the stage To keep Carrie from
seeing it (and feeling weird) he grabs her hand--

TOMMY
Slow song

CARRIE

Tommy leads Carrie nervously to the middle of the gym
There under a galaxy of cut-out stars they dance Tommys
arms around her protectively

TOMMY (CONT’D)

Carrie cant help herself she leans up and KISSES Tommy on
the lips A peck but she did it Theyre both surprised
Carrie immediately retreats--

CARRIE

Looking at Margaret seventeen years younger (and softer)
She has just come into the room and stopped dead in her
tracks Holding a glass babys bottle of milk which she lets
fall from grip in shock The milk bottle SHATTERS Margaret
covers her mouth to keep from screaming

The camera revealsher baby daughters crib Above it a
mobile of little pink plastic animals DANCING IN THE AIR
off their strings While underneath them Baby Carrie coos in
delight

cowering in the shower room menstrual blood running down her
legs Underwear and tampons strewn about her The picture
Chris Hargensen snapped revealed The final coup de grace

Focus on The STEEL BUCKET swinging above Carrie and
Tommy

Then One of the kids in the audience starts to LAUGH Carrie
finds him in the crowd that creepy GREG from outside
Morton’s office Then she spots the Beak still video-
taping Carries mind races to put it all together

CARRIE
(to Tommy )
You tricked me

THE STEEL BUCKET IS FALLING ROPE TRAILING BEHIND IT--

TOMMY
What No Carrie this is--

Through the POV of the Beak’s camera we see The bucket
hitting Tommy in the head in exactly the wrong way knocking
him unconscious--

Tommy crumples to a heap at Carries feet clawing at her
dress as he goes down--

OH SHIT--

NO LONGER THROUGH THE BEAK’S CAMERA we see--Carrie reeling
turn back to the crowd More kids laughing Tina Nicki Some
of its nervous laughter some malicious-—-

Close-up on Carrie’s blood-face Hearing in her mind the
girls’ chants “Plug it up Plug it up Plug it up” And her
mother’s shrieks “The first curse is the curse of blood

The Beak collecting himself resumes filming THROUGH HIS
CAMERA we see Carrie covering her ears trying to blot out
the laughter and jeering-- She SHAMBLES off stage looking
for the doors for escape--

Ms Desjardin tries to get to Carrie to comfort her--

MS DESJARDIN
Oh Carrie let me help you Im--

Carrie doesn’t break her stride-- But the traumatized girl
seems to glance at Desjardin-- AND THEN THE GYM TEACHER GOES
FLYING into the blob-like crowd--

(recording this)
Holy fuck-- What the hell-- WHAT
THE HELL JUST HAPPENED Did you
see that

NO LONGER FROM THE BEAK’S POV The kids are backing away from
Carrie but then someone (Lizzy) sticks out a foot and
Carrie careening trips over it and wipes out leaving a
bloody smear beneath her-- (The Beak resumes filming--)

More laughter more confusion Carrie scrambles to her feet
and barrels through the same double doors she and Tommy had
entered not even two hours ago

looked--

A QUICK CUTFLASH back to Carrie Close on her blood-covered
face everything red except for her raccoon eyes Her face
fills the screen and just as Emma described it looks like
it has been cleaved in two--

EMMA (VO)
Like something had broken inside
her Like her soul had been

Back in the conference room Emma clarifies

EMMA
It all happened so fast no one
really registered what was
happening So if some of us were
laughing it wasnt because we
thought it was funny it was
because we didn’t know how to
react I mean again it was all so
surreal

After Carries fled Students milling around processing
Dread and unease fill the gym Some girls are crying being
comforted by their boyfriends

THROUGH THE BEAK’S CAMERA WE SEE George and Erika on the

The Beak lowers his camera just as the gym lights FLICKER
something disrupting them Sarah rushes up to Emma in the
middle of all this--

SARAH
Hey look Carries back

The Beak hearing this flips open his camera and turns to
the gym’s double doors-- THROUGH THE BEAK’S SHAKY JITTERING
CAMERA WE SEE Carrie a terrifying vision still drenched
in blood like some biblical avenging angel stride back into
the gym The heavy steel doors slamming shut behind her--

Carrie STREAKS across the schools lawn loses one prom shoe
then the other The grass is wet with spring dew she slips
and falls face-first--

A beat Everything’s still All we hear is Carrie panting
then crying She rolls on to her back looks up at sky
Against the black velvet--lots of stars up there--Carrie sees
the branches of an oak tree limbs full of green leaves
Motionless in the still night

Looking down on Carrie weeping shaking her head--

CARRIE
No NonononononononononoNo--

Carrie wipes at her tears streaking her face She looks up
at the tree again flexesand the oaks limbs start to
SWAY

Calmer now she sits up feels the power surging through her

Shards of glass rain down on the STUDENTS sending some of
them (but not all not yet) towards the gym’s various doors--

The gym is now ALL RED AND PURPLE (lit by the few remaining
intact spots) Carries studying the grid of water pipes
bolted to the ceiling She flexes--the sprinklers activate--
IT BEGINS TO RAIN IN THE GYM

Angle on Greg and his equally creepy cohort Harry looking
up at the sprinklers--

GREG

court’s ruined--

The kids freaking-out more and more with each second that
passes are now RUSHING the doors pushing people aside to
escape This catches Carries attention

SLAMMING shut handles snapping off in the process SLAM
SLAM SLAM On the fourth set of doors Carries a little
late One BOY is pulling at the doors edge holding it open

over and over forcing the girl to back into the ever-
spreading blaze TINAS DRESS CATCHES FIRE she starts
spinning like a top trying to beat out the flames to no
avail

Angle on Those assholes Greg and Harry along with Nicki and
Lizzy scrambling up a set of open bleachers towards the
gym’s upper windows Carrie focuses on them flexesand the
bleachers start to collapse--to flatten and shut--with Greg
Harry Nicki and Lizzy still on them--

Meanwhile The painted backdrop of Venice is burning smoke
is filling the gym as the fire spreads up one entire side of
the gym across the ceiling over the sprinklers-- Lighting
instruments and flaming decorations are FALLING from the
ceiling--

Carrie’s attention turns back to the stage Principal MORTON
and English Teacher ULMANN are at the microphone stupidly
fighting for control of it Carrie looks at them--

Hears in her memory Ulmann mocking her “You want Jesus to
take you to the prom” Hears Morton in her mind “We’re all
so sorry about this Cassie--

Carrie focuses on the place where the microphone’s electrical
cord plugs into its baseand flexes The cord RIPS free
sparking sending a current of electricity into the pool of
water both men are standing in and--ZZZITTTT

Their electrocution is gruesome horrificand it gives
Carrie an idea

She looks up into the rafters At the thick electrical cords
bunched-up and affixed to the rigging the trusses She
flexesand one by one like octopus tentacles they whip
free (sending down showers of sparks) and start snaking their
way towards the gym floor under an inch of water

VOICE (0S)
Carrie no Dont

Carrie turns to--Miss Desjardin standing across from her
The shot reverses so that we’re looking at Carrie from
Desjardin’s POV Behind the girl the flames are spreading
the gyms turning into an inferno and those live wires are
almost touching the inundated floor

MS DESJARDIN
Please--

Carrie (feeling mercy) flexes--and Desjardin is LIFTED into
the air and HURLED across the gym through a set of double
doors that spring open for a moment then slam shut again--

That done Carrie turns back to the live wires She DROPS
them into the water covering the entire gym floor--

And suddenly all the students are doing that horrible danse

macabre but very quickly we’re on Carrie’s face surveying

everything she has wrought Enough she thinks (More than
enough actually the gym now looks like that image of hell

from the painting in Carrie closet)

Pull back to reveal Carrie in silhouette against the
terrible burning walking off the gym floor wading OVER this
apocalypse like something out of a nightmarish opera
levitating herself towards a set of doors flexing them open
and passing from the gym out into the waiting night

QUICK SHOT OF Chamberlain’s EMERGENCY SIREN atop the

Back with Sue as she turns towards the kitchens big picture

from the direction of the school Sue CLICKS on the TV set in
the kitchen An EMERGENCY NEWS REPORT flashes on the screen
for a split-second (whatwasthat) before it goes to STATIC--

Sue’s brow furrows Then The lights in her house FLICKER

whistling is the first explosion of the night (coming from
the direction of that glow) ROCKS Chamberlain awake--

Quinlan comes out of Sugars and sees another fire hydrant
across the intersection SPEWING water into the air Behind
him the diners lights FLICKER on and off as if something
were short-circuiting them

Quinlan’s POV A glimpse of a red SCARECROW-LIKE FIGURE
seemingly gliding from the hydrant towards the pumps of an
Amoco Station (with five gas pumps) also across the street
Only a quick glimpse however because then a fire engine
ZOOMS PAST sirens blaring lights flashing obscuring

Carrie looks at Billy for a quick second flexes and BILLYS
HEAD TWISTS AROUND HIS NECK SNAPPING LIKE A TWIG--

Then it’s just Carrie and Chris the two girls staring into
each others’ faces echoing that moment on the blacktop when
they crashed into each other during the volleyball game--
Chris opens the car door tries to jump out but Carrie
flexes--and the door slams shut trapping Chris--

Carrie flexes again and the seatbelt SLAPS across Chris’s
chest CLICKING into place-- Carrie flexes some more--and the

Carrie flexes Billy’s car hovers suspended in mid-air a
moment longer then SLAMS into the brick side of the
Cavalier so that the car’s top CRUMPLES like tinfoil Chris
SCREAMS (she’s still not dead)--

Carrie flexes again swings the car out towards the left
then (like a wrecking ball) SLAMS it back into the Cavalier

Give us this day our daily
bread”

She lifts it high over Carries head and brings it down
STABBING CARRIE IN THE BACK The girls eyes go wide she
immediately instinctually pushes away from--
CARRIE

Reeling from the shock and pain Carrie tries to grasp the
knife handle sticking in her back--

CARRIE (CONT’D)
Momma WHY--

The girl is crawlingscrambling away from her mother who
follows her step by agonizing bleeding step

MARGARET
Oh Carrie I have wrestled with
devil over your soul the way Jacob
wrestled the Angel of the Lord
Since the stonessince before the
stonesI’ve tried to fill you
with goodness I’ve tried to fill
you with grace

As Carrie and then Margaret pass the doorway to the kitchen
Margaret picks up ANOTHER KNIFE--

MARGARET (CONTD)
But I lost Carrie time and again
I lost and I knew I knew what I
had to do but I was weak and and
backsliding but not tonight--

Margaret has Carrie cornered The girl is weakened bleeding
profusely Margaret looms over her daughter

Tonight the devil has come home
and I will not be weak--

daughter but Carrie flexes--and STOPS Margarets arm in mid-
swing Mother and daughter lock eyes

MARGARET (CONTD)
It’s better this way They’1l come
for you after what you did
They’1l hurt you--

reveal Behind Margaret hovering in mid-air the tools of
Margarets sewing trade SCISSORS SHEARS KNITTING NEEDLES

their prayer

of ecstasy because at long last shes going to the Lord
