INT A JEEP LEBANON - DAY

And were in a speeding SOVIET JEEP Two men in front
shouldering assault rifles HEZBOLLAH SOLDIERS And there
are three MEN in the back A middle-aged Man wearing a tired
suit and tinted sunglasses trying to hold on And on either
side of him two Men blindfolded The man on one side is in
his forties hands pressed in the pockets of a well-travelled
black-leather jacket A stocky man with the edge of a
JD Salinger character hes seen everything at least once
But even he has lost some of his self-confidence here
turning his head sensing the wind a blast of Arabic music
that disappears behind him Hes LOWELL BERGMAN On the
other side of the man in the tired suit is a lanky Man with a
voltmeter around his neck NORMAN

EXT THE BEQAA VALLEY BAALBEK LEBANON - DAY

The Jeep races up narrow winding streets of a Lebanese
village Its shadowed by a Jeep in front and in back each
carrying personnel armed with AKs and a few RPGs And in
the third Jeep are two blindfolded not very threatening
Lebanese soldiers And as the speeding convoy passes a
captured Israeli Armored Personnel Carrier covered with
Arabic graffiti looking down on them from huge murals are
the stern visages of the Ayatollah Khomeini and a Hezbollah
religious leader the Sheikh Fadlallah And suddenly the
convoy skids to a stop And blindfolded Lowell and Norman
are roughly taken out and pushed stumbling through the
cloud of dust without sight The lanky cameraman is
stopped told to wait while Lowell is pushed past armed men
guarding a small stone house and inside

INT A HOUSE IN LEBANON - DAY

A round-faced Man in his mid-forties with large-framed
glasses black hair and a grey-black beard wearing a
dullbend a turban sits informally at a kitchen table
Its the Sheikh Fadlallah whose face stares out at us from
walls A Gunman cradling an AK-47 sits in an incongruous
purple armchair in a corner A torn poster of the Seychelles
is on one wall Another Gunman stands by a window Lowell
is sat down in a chair at the kitchen table

THE SHEIKH
Coffee

LOWELL
Yeah Thank you

THE SHEIKH

How have you liked your stay

LOWELL
(droll)
What Ive seenIve liked

The Sheikh smiles And the smile passes as quickly as it
came A steaming cup of coffee in a small Arabic demitasse
is put down

THE SHEIKH
Please to explain why I should agree to
interviewwith pro-Zionist American
media

LOWELL

Because I think Hezbollah is trying to
broaden into a political party right now
So you care about what youre thought of
in America And in America at this
moment in time Hezbollah does not have a
face

(confident)
Thats why

And weve first realized this man is not a hostage hes come
here voluntarily

THE SHEIKH
Perhaps you prove journalism objectivity
and I see the questions first Then I
decide if I grant the interview

LOWELL

(blunt)
No We dont do that

(beat)
Youve seen 60 Minutes and Mike
Wallace So you know our reputation for
integrity and objectivity You also know
we are the highest-rated most-respected
TV-magazine news show in America

The Sheikh quietly looks out his glasses at him studying
him And Lowell closes

LOWELL (contd)
So Mr Wallace Should he get ona

plane or not

The Sheikh thinks it over and then

THE SHEIKH
Tell him I will see him day after
tomorrow

LOWELL

Thats good That works

(after a beat)
Uh you know I want to ask you
somethingI know it sounds oddbut

Its quiettoo quiet

LOWELL (CONTD)
Hello Sheikh
(no answer)
Hello Sheikh

Silence He hesitates starts to lift his blindfold He
lifts it And he sees the Sheikh and his gunmen are gone
The house empty Only his Cameraman the lanky man left
there standing by the door still in his blindfold

LOWELL (CONTD)
Norman

NORMAN
What What

LOWELL
Take your blindfold off

The lanky man does and we see the cameraman is Asian-
American

LOWELL (CONTD)
(sarcastic)
Welcome to the world

Norman gives Lowell an ironic look and tests the local
current at an electrical outlet

NORMAN
Fluctuating all over the place Anywhere
we shoot here its gonna be portable
gennies and well run cable

Lowell nods and opens the curtains from this commanding
height Baalbek and the Begaa Valley below gold-domed
mosques A moment of triumph He dials his cell phone

late forties watching them

INT JEFFREY WIGANDS OFFICE - DAY

Sheikh and Mike with microphones Norman says something to
Lowell and then goes out

NORMAN

Sheikh absorbed in his notes for the upcoming interview
ignores all of this

INTERPRETER
He says you must not sit so close

MIKE WALLACE

The Bodyguard bristling at Wallaces tone barks more
confrontational Arabic

INTERPRETER

As Mike leaps forward moving inches from the Bodyguards
face with such sudden ferocity even the Bodyguard flinches

Mike tipping his glasses down while the hostile Gunmen
cradling weapons watch him through the doorway

MIKE WALLACE (CONTD)
Americans believe that you as an Islamic
fundamentalist that you are a leader who

place is impressive

THOMAS SANDEFUR

Jeffrey says exactly whats on his mind
Most people consider what theyre
sayingsocial skills Jeffrey just
charges right ahead

(smiles after a beat)
Now I know you understood the nature of
the confidentiality portion of your
severance agreement with Brown and
Williamson Jeff

WIGAND
Chapter and verse

THOMAS SANDEFUR
(nods)
Yeah I know you do
And there

(beat)
You know I came up through sales One
of the reasons I was a great salesman
was I never made a promise I couldnt
keep

(beat)
I knew that if I ever broke my promise
Id suffer the consequence

s a warning behind it

WIGAND
(contained)
Is that a threat

THOMAS SANDEFUR
we worked together for what was it
three years
Now the work we did here is
confidential not for public
scrutinyany more than are ones family
matters

WIGAND
(quietly)
You threatening my family now too

THOMAS SANDEFUR
Now dont be paranoid Jeff
(a beat)
About the direction of research here we
may have had our differences of
opinion

WIGAND
Research
(smile scorn)
You declare as a badge of honor you
dont even know what makes water boil

THOMAS SANDEFUR
Thats why we hire scientists

WIGAND

(interrupts direct)
Okay

(a beat honest)
I dont believe you can maintain
corporate integrity without
confidentiality agreements I was paid
well for my work The health and welfare
benefits are good The severance package
is fair I have no intention of
violating my confidentiality agreement
and disclosing that which I said I
wouldnt

THOMAS SANDEFUR
I appreciate all that Jeff But upon
reflectionweve decided to expand our
zone of comfort with you

And theres a seriousness that weighs heavily on the room

THOMAS SANDEFUR (CONTD)
So weve drafted a supplement to your

agreementit broadly defines and
expands in more detail what is
confidential Nobody will be able to

say Well hells bells Margaret I
didnt know that was a secret

(beat)
Were very serious about protecting our
interests

(a beat)
Wed like you to sign it

And hes acutely aware of the threat behind it

WIGAND

(a beat)
And if I dont

A LAWYER

(speaking for Sandefur)
If we arrive at the conclusion youre
acting in bad faith We would terminate
right now payouts under your severance
package You and your familys medical
benefits And initiate litigation
against you Mr Wigand

WIGAND
Dr Wigand

A LAWYER
(a beat)
Dr Wigandafter youve examined the
document you will see it is in your own
best interest and youll sign it

Jeffrey slowly turns to face the attorney And we see on his
face the true nature of this man
WIGAND
So what you are saying is it isnt
enough that you fired me For no good
reason Now you question my integrity
On top of the humiliation of being fired

You threaten me You threaten my
family

(beat)
It never crossed my mind not to honor my
agreement

(turning to Sandefur)
But I will tell you Mr Sandefur and
Brown and Williamson too Fuck me
(a beat)
Well fuck you

And with that he gets up and leaves And its quiet

A LAWYER
Im not sure he got the message

THOMAS SANDEFUR
(with total confidence)
Oh I think he did

EXT A PHONE BOOTH LOUISVILLE - DAY
Wigand picks up the phone and dials

INT THE RESTAURANT NEW YORK - DAY

Lowell holding the dead phone in his hand
EXT A GOLF DRIVING RANGE LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

We see a brightly lit golf driving range empty the wet
grass under the lights vibrant emerald green A caged
cart with one big yellow headlight like some kind of
strange insect drives across the range picking up golf
balls And we see Jeffrey hitting golf balls driving one
after another after another His swing is powerful
angry a lone golfer trying to chill out He pauses spent
Settling down he exhales Then he looks down the way
And he slows He sees in the far distance spot-lit one
other lone golfer a Stocky Man incongruously in a suit and
tie watching him And the Man in the suit right then
with great power and a tremendous follow through drives a
golf ball The ball slamming into the steel net And the
lights SUDDENLY go out The range closing for the night

The insect comes to a stop And its quiet dark Jeffrey
gathers up his clubs He crosses his golf shoes the metal
cleats clicking on the pavement toward the PARKING LOT
And theres the sound of the clicking of golf shoes behind
him He turns And the stocky Man in the suit carrying a
golf bag walking some distance behind him staring at him
Jeffrey comes to the parking lot Its empty Just
Jeffreys car and despite all the empty spaces another car
purposely or otherwise parked right next to his He crosses
to his car getting in

INT WIGANDS CAR - NIGHT

He drops the three clubs in the rear seat and settles behind
the wheel He turns And he sees the Man in the suit has
gotten in the car next to his They look at each other The
Man in no hurry lights a cigarette relaxes Its
malevolent as hell And Jeffrey suddenly grabbing a golf
club jumps out of his car
EXT THE PARKING LOT DRIVING RANGE LOUISVILLE - NIGHT

Golf club in hand at the driver side window

WIGAND
(motioning with the club
threatening)
Stay away from me You stay away from

me

The Man starts his car and drives off nonplussed Its
still And as Jeffrey with the golf club stands in the empty
parking lot not knowing whats threatening him something
real something imaginary

EXT THE WIGAND HOUSE LOUISVILLE - WIDE SHOT WIGANDS

It starts to rain harder They look at each other Jeffrey

Lowell left standing in the driveway with Liane in the rain
Liane goes back into the house And Lowell starts back
across the street to his car Theres a sound He turns
Jeffreys car having gone around the corner has come back
and stopped in the street

WIGAND

Lowell hesitates then gets into the car in the back seat
INT WIGANDS CAR - MORNING

INT WIGANDS CAR - WIDE FRONTAL - DAY

DISSOLVE TO

Jeffs car in the field the giant Colgate-Palmolive clock
behind The rain stopped Steam rises from the weed strewn

empty lot Lowells in the front seat
feeling theyve been talking for hours

And we get the
LOWELLS VOICE (OVER)
Just give me an example

WIGAND

For example James Burke the CEO of
Johnson and Johnsonwhen he found out
that some lunatic had put poison in
Tylenol bottles he didnt argue with the
FDA He didnt even wait for the FDA
to tell him He just pulled Tylenol off
every shelf of every store right across
America Instantly And then he
developed the safety cap Because
look as a CEO sure hes gotta be a
great businessman right But hes also
aman of science Hes not going to
allow his companyto put on the
shelfa product that might hurt people

(sarcastic)
Not like the Seven Dwarfs

LOWELL
Seven dwarfs

WIGAND
The seven CEOs of Big Tobaccothey got
up in front of Congress that timeit

was on television

LOWELL
and swore under oath that they know
nothing about addiction disease

WIGAND
It was on C-SPAN Yeah

LOWELL

Okay so here you areyou go to work
for tobacco

(after beat)
You come from corporate cultures where
research really creative thinking
these are core values You go to
tobacco Tobacco is a sales culture
Market and sell enormous volume Go to a
lot of golf tournaments The hell with
everything else

(beat)
What are you doing Why are you working
for tobacco in the first place
WIGAND

(deadly honest)
I cant talk about it The work I was
supposed to domight have had some
positive effect I dont knowit could
have been beneficial

(bitterness there)
Mostly I got paid a lot I took the
money My wife was happy My kids had
good medical Good schools Got a
great house

(simply)
I mean what the hell is wrong with
that

He looks at Lowell as if needing validation

LOWELL
Nothings wrong with that Thats it
youre making moneyyoure providing
for your family What could be wrong
with that

Its quiet After some moments

WIGAND
Ive always thought of myselfas a man
of science Thats whats wrong with it

LOWELL
Thenyoure in a state of conflict
Jeff

Jeffrey doesnt say anything

LOWELL (CONTD)
Because look heres how it lays out if
you got vital insider stuff the American
people for their welfare really do need
to knowand you feel impelled to
disclose it and violate your agreement in
doing so thats one thing On the other
hand if you want to honor this
agreement then thats simple You do
so You say nothing You do nothing
Theres only one guy who can figure that
out for you And thats you All by
yourself

Lowells evenhandedis it too evenhanded As Wigand
contemplates the edge hes standing on theyre quiet Then
Wigand sees the time
WIGAND
Ive got to go pick up the girls They
only had half a day

Lowell nods Jeffrey starts the car The windshield wipers
screech on a dry window Their eyes meet As they drive
offwe HOLD on the Colgate-Palmolive Clock

INT A KITCHEN AREA CBS OFFICES NEW YORK - DAY

Weve entered mid-scene A monitor on a cart plays a 12-
inch VCR of a C-SPAN broadcast Seven CEOs of Big Tobacco
in front of a bas relief of the American eagle Each in turn
swears nicotine is not addictive or he doesnt know anything
about health risks theyre not sure maybe maybe not
etc

LOWELL (OVER)
He referred to thisthe Seven Dwarfs

MIKE WALLACE (OVER)
What Seven Dwarfs

LOWELL (OVER)

The seven CEOs of Big Tobacco Referred
to this Said they should be afraid of
him I assume afraid of what he could
reveal

(to Staff Lawyers)
Now you tell me What does this guy
have to say that threatens these people

And now we see Lowell Mike Wallace and Debbie DeLuca with
two staff Lawyers MARK STERN and JOHN HARRIS sitting around
a workstation used as an improvised eating area

Beyond them are the 60 MINUTES offices workstations piles
of material television monitors hanging from the ceiling
all tuned to CBS programming

MIKE WALLACE
Well it isnt cigarettes are bad for
you

LOWELL
Hardly new news

MIKE WALLACE
No shit

LOWELL
Whats this

MARK STERN

(re video)
What that is is tobaccos standard
defense Its the we dont know
litany Addiction We believe not
Disease We dont know We take a bunch
of leaves roll em together You smoke
em After that Youre on your own
We dont know

(beat)
Sotells me nothing

(beat)
Besides youll never get what hes got

LOWELL
Why not

JOHN HARRIS
Because of this guys confidentiality
agreement he is never gonna be able to
talk to you

LOWELL
Thats not good enough This guy is the
top scientist in the number three tobacco
company in America Hes a corporate
officer You never get whistle-blowers
from Fortune 500 companies This guy is
the ultimate insider Hes got something
to say he wants to say it I want it on
60 Minutes

JOHN HARRIS
Doesnt matter what he wants

MIKE WALLACE
Am I missing something here

JOHN HARRIS
What do you mean Mike

MIKE WALLACE
Hes got a corporate secrecy agreement
Give me a break This is a public-health
issue like an unsafe airframe on a
passenger jet orsome company dumping
cyanide into the East River Issues like
that He can talk we can air it
Theyve got no right to hide behind a
corporate agreement
(re his coffee)
Pass the milk

JOHN HARRIS
(does)
They dont need the right Theyve got
the money

MARK STERN

The unlimited checkbook Thats how Big
Tobacco wins every time On everything
They spend you to death 600 million a
year in outside legal Chadbourne-Parke
Ken Starrs firm Kirkland and Ellis
Listen GM and Ford they get nailed
after 11 or 12 pick-ups blow up Right
These clowns have neverI mean ever

fq

JOHN HARRIS
Not even once

MARK STERN
not even with hundreds of thousands
dying each year from an illness related
to their producthave ever lost a
personal-injury lawsuit On this case
theyll issue gag orders sue for breach
anticipatory breach enjoin him you us
his pet dog the dogs veterinarian
Tie him up in litigation for ten of
fifteen years Im telling you they bat
a thousand Every time He knows that
Thats why hes not gonna talk to you

Lowells been quiet thinking about something else Now

LOWELL
Okay lets look through the looking
glass the other way

MIKE WALLACE
What do you mean

LOWELL
We got a guywho wants to talk but hes
constrained

(beat)
What if he were compelled

MIKE WALLACE
(eating)
Oh torture Great ratings
Pause

MARK STERN
What do you mean compelled

LOWELL
(seriously)
I mean compelled by a Justice Department
state courts be a witness That would
cut through any confidentiality
agreement wouldnt it

MARK STERN
Yeah

DEBBIE DELUCA
What does that do

LOWELL
What do you mean whats it do

DEBBIE DELUCA
What I mean is like how does it cut
through the confidentiality agreement

LOWELL
Because he has to reveal it in a court of
law Its on record its out Its no

secret anymore So how can they restrain
his speech or retaliate Its out in the
world

MARK STERN
(nods)
If you could engineer it into the court
record you might have something They
would have a helluva time trying to
restrain his speech then wouldnt they

JOHN HARRIS
(still skeptical)
Yeah but what venue And where does he
get - does he have killer attorneys

LOWELL
I dont think hes got any attorneys

MARK STERN
Hes gonna need attorneys who arent
afraid of risking years of litigation
And millions of dollars of their own
dough in legal costs

LOWELL
What do you say Mike What do you
think

MIKE WALLACE
(pause)
Even if he gets the defense team will he
go for it

LOWELL
What did you get us

WIGAND
Tempura

WIGAND (contd)
The internet said you did graduate work
in Wisconsin then went to UC La Jolla

LOWELL
Marcuse Yeah He was my mentor He
had a major influence on the New Left in
the late 60sand on me personally

WIGAND
Next to your father

LOWELL
My father What the hells that got to
do with my father

WIGAND
Is that why you became a journalist
Then you get to ask all the questions

LOWELL
You charge by the hour

WIGAND
My father was a mechanical
engineermost ingenious man I ever
knew

LOWELL
Well my father left us when I was five-
years old He was not the most ingenious
man I ever knew Lets get back to
Brown and Williamson If you decide to go
on 60 Minutes I got to know everything
about why you got fired

WIGAND
Why

LOWELL
Theyre gonna dig up stuff from your
past theyre gonna throw it at you I
got to know what theyre gonna throw
You understand

WIGAND

(concedes)
I drink A couple of occasions more than
I should have

(thinks)
I was cited for shoplifting once But it
was a mistake

(hesitant after a beat)
I pushed Liane one time We were both
stressed out because of the pressure
She went to her mothers

(out of the blue)
I got fired because when I get angry I
have difficulty censoring myself And I
dont like to be pushed around

LOWELL
Im not pushing you around
(after a beat)
Im asking you questions

WIGAND
Im just a commodity to you arent I I
could be anything Right Anything
worth putting on between commercials

LOWELL
(honest)
to a network probably were all
commodities
(beat)
To me You are not a commodity What
you are is important

And hes begun to consciously or unconsciously sell

LOWELL (contd)
You go public and thirty-million people
hear what you got to say nothing I mean
nothing will ever be the same again

Wigand doesnt react

LOWELL (contd)
You believe that

WIGAND
(skeptical)
No

LOWELL
You should Because when youre done a
judgment is going to go down in the court
of public opinion my friend And thats
the power you have

WIGAND
You believe that

LOWELL
I believe that Yes I believe that

WIGAND
You believe that because you get
information out to peoplesomething
happens

LOWELL
Yes

WIGAND
Maybe thats just what youve been
telling yourself all these years to
justify having a good job Having
status And maybe for the audience its
just voyeurism Something to do on a
Sunday night And maybe it wont change
a fucking thing And people like myself
and my family are left hung out to dry
Used up Broke alone

LOWELL
Are you talking to me or did somebody
else just walk in here I never

abandoned a source

WIGAND
I dont think you really understand --

LOWELL
(running over)
No dont evade a choice you gotta make
be questioning my reputation or 60
Minutes with this cheap skepticism

WIGAND
I have to put my familys welfare on the
line here my friend And what are you
puttin up Youre puttin up words

and Williamson a former corporate officer
there

RICHARD SCRUGGS
Whats your interest in this Mr
Bergman

LOWELL
Well he may tape an interview with us
And we believe if his testimony showed
up in a court record first it would free
him up from his confidentiality agreement
and give him some protection

MOTLEY
It could work If its public record
its public record

LOWELL
Yeah and hes going to need legal
representation

MOTLEY

He sure as hell will

RICHARD SCRUGGS
(a beat)
Has he decided to go public Because

fence Thats the point

INT DINING ROOM THE FOUR SEASONS HOTEL NEW YORK - NIGHT

And we slide by some elegant diners to fall onto Lowell and
Mike Wallace with Jeffrey and Liane in the Hotels dining
room having ordered dinner

LOWELL
So is everything okay

MIKE WALLACE
How are the rooms Comfortable

LIANE
(to Mike)
Yes very You know I enjoy your work
so muchwhen youre talking to
somebody I always feel like Im right
there

And she laughs

MIKE WALLACE
Thank you got saying that

LOWELL
Do you think we could talk about the
taping Tomorrows taping just so we
can get it out of the way and order

MIKE WALLACE
Yeah well questions will go toward what
work you did there why you were fired
And others will deal
LIANE
(not sure she quite heard)
taping
(beat)
What are you taping

WIGAND
Im doing an interview

LIANE
(whispers)
An interview Do you know what they will
do to us I thought Sorry

But she suddenly gets up and leaves hurrying out of the
dining room And Jeffrey oddly doesnt move

LOWELL
(trying to intervene)
Liane this is a preliminary
(after a beat)
You didnt tell her we were taping
What did she think she was coming to New
York for

WIGAND
»to talk about it To think about it
I had a plan to ease her into it But I
really - I didnt know how to do that

Jeffrey abruptly crosses to the nearby Bar

LOWELL
Oh man

MIKE WALLACE
Who are these people

LOWELL
(frustrated)
Ordinary people Under extraordinary
pressure Mike What the hell do you
expect Grace and consistency

And Lowell leaves the table And as Mike Wallace sits at the
table looking around wondering what the fuck hes doing
there

INT THE BATHROOM NEW YORK HOTEL - NIGHT

Liane folds her arms protectively across her chest
INT A STUDIO CBS - MORNING

And we see a small TAPING STUDIO separated by flats and black
curtains from other CBS News sets Cameras are set up

INT THE STUDIO CBS - DAY

And we enter mid-scene on Jeffrey in a more formal demeanor
sitting in a chair Mike Wallace sitting across from him
under the lights taping an interview Lowell off camera

MIKE WALLACE
You heard Mr Sandefur say before
Congress that he believed nicotine was
not addictive

WIGAND
(nods)
I believe Mr Sandefur perjured
himself because I watched those
testimonies very carefully

Lowells reaction Jeffreys statements are stunning and
powerful revelationsand dangerous ones to make

MIKE WALLACE
All of us did There was this whole line
of peoplewhole line of CEOs up there
all swearing

WIGAND
Part of the reason Im here is I felt
that their representation clearly
misstated at least within Brown and
Williamsons representation clearly
misstatedwhat is common language
within the companywe are in the
nicotine delivery business

MIKE WALLACE
And thats what cigarettes are for

WIGAND
A delivery device for nicotine

MIKE WALLACE
A delivery device for nicotine Put it
in your mouth light it up and youre
gonna get your fix

WIGAND
Youre gonna get your fix

MIKE WALLACE
Youre saying that Brown and Williamson
manipulates and adjusts the nicotine fix
not by artificially adding nicotine but
by enhancing the effect of nicotine
through the use of chemical elements such
as ammonia

WIGAND

(nods)
The process is known as impact
boosting While not spiking nicotine
they clearly manipulate it Theres
extensive use of this technology know
as ammonia chemistry It allows for
the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed
in the lung and therefore affect the
brain and central nervous system

INT THE STUDIO CBS - LATER

WIGAND
The straw that broke the camels back for
me and really put me in trouble with
Sandefur was a compound called
coumarin When I came on board at BandW
they had tried to transition from
coumarin to a similar flavor that would
give the same taste and had been

unsuccessful I wanted it out
immediately

I was told that it would affect sales so
I should mind my own business I

constructed a memo to Mr Sandefur
indicating I could not in conscience
continue with coumarin in a product that
we now knew we had documentation was
similar to coumadin a lung-specific
carcinogen

MIKE WALLACE
And you sent the document forward to
Sandefur

WIGAND
I sent the document forward to Sandefur
I was told that we would continue to work
on a substitute we werent going to
remove it as it would impact sales and
that that was his decision
MIKE WALLACE
In other words you were charging
Sandefur and Brown and Williamson with
ignoring health considerations
consciously

WIGAND
Most certainly

MIKE WALLACE
And on March 24 Thomas Sandefur CEO of
Brown and Williamson had you fired And
the reason he gave you

WIGAND
Poor communication skills

MIKE WALLACE
And do you wish you hadnt come forward
You wish you hadnt blown the whistle

WIGAND
Yeah there are times I wish I hadnt
done it There are times I feel
compelled to do it If you asked me
would I do it again Do I think its
worth it Yeah I think its worth it

INT A HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE CLASS LOUISVILLE - AFTERNOON

Not too many kids paying attention Meanwhile Jeffrey has

She goes over and holds his hand And as he holds her hand
seeing what his life has become he looks up and his glance
connects with Lowell

INT THE KITCHEN THE WIGANDS HOUSE - NIGHT

We see out the window a Security Guard incongruous walking
by And we see Liane finished with the dinner dishes
silently wiping off the sink Theres a pall you could cut
with a knife A moment and Jeffrey comes in the kitchen
door from the garden He stops to wash his hands in the
sink

LIANE
Please dont wash your hands in the sink
WIGAND
Where should I wash them

LIANE
Use the bathroom

WIGAND
Whats the difference

LIANE
Thats for food

But he ignores her washing his hands And she turns the
water off He turns it back on He thinks then turns it
off Then she turns it on

LIANE (contd)
Leave it on Just leave it on okay

And she turns and leaves the room coldly all her anger
repressed For Jeffrey everything else and now this The
running faucet

EXT THE WIGANDS HOUSE LOUISVILLE - LATE NIGHT

The house on the quiet suburban street A Security Guard
incongruous a noticeable bulge where his shoulder holster
is sitting watch under the porch light on the small front
porch in a metal porch chair

INT THE BASEMENT THE WIGANDS HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

And we see Jeffrey unable to sleep sitting at his desk
alone in the basement listening to classical music He
instinctively turns And he sees Liane in her bathrobe has
come down to sit on the basement stairs He looks over at
her And he thinks shes come down to make up And all she
really wants him to do is say I need you But he
cant And like ships that pass in the night nothings
said Its quiet She puts her hands protectively in her
robe pockets And she starts to cry

LIANE
I dont think I can do this I want to
stand by my husband I really do
Jeffrey But I dont think I can do this
anymore I am so sorry

WIGAND

Can we talk about this when I get back

She goes back up the stairs And as Jeffrey sits in the
basement and the music plays

INT THE LOUISVILLE AIRPORT - DAY

We see Jeffrey and his Security Man He passes a small
Filipino Woman in a nurses uniform and a Man in clerical
garb who hands him a small American Flag asking for
donations And now he passes through the metal detector
He nods thanks and walks towards us relaxing looking behind
every so often to see if anybody is following him As he
passes Gate 3 he HEARS over his shoulder

THE MAN
(friendly)
Jeff

Jeffrey turns and the Man throws a sheaf of SUBPOENAS at his
chest

THE MAN (CONTD)
(nasty)
Youve been served

And he turns and walks off And as Jeffrey looks down at the
subpoenas

INT RICHARD SCRUGGS KITCHEN - 700 AM

Jeffrey is sitting with Scruggs and Motley in Scruggs
kitchen around a semi-circular counter Coffee and sweet
rolls Its casual No ones dressed for court Scruggs
has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas About
Motley we sense power held in reserve

RICHARD SCRUGGS
Now what this one is is a temporary
restraining order a gag order issued by
a Kentucky court

Meanwhile a movie-star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a
tie a coffee cup in his hand enters and sits casually on
the arm of a chair

RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONTD)
(introducing)
Jeff Wigand Michael Moore

MICHAEL MOORE
Good to meet you Dr Wigand
RICHARD SCRUGGS
Mikes our Attorney General down here
(to Moore)
I was just explaining to Jeff they got a
Kentucky court to issue a gag order to
stop his deposition today

MICHAEL MOORE
Right

RICHARD SCRUGGS
Now they tried to get the Mississippi
Court to honor it but the judge threw it
out
(to Jeffrey)
However for you there is a more
perilous effect to the Kentucky gag
order

MICHAEL MOORE
(after a beat)
Dr Wigand you do understand what could
happen dont you

WIGAND
Im not free to testifyhere

MOTLEY
Thats right If you violate the
Kentucky order when you step foot back
in Kentucky they can find you in
contempt and they can incarcerate you
And you ought to know that

And Jeffrey fairly turns white its never occurred to him he
might go to jail

WIGAND
Jail

RICHARD SCRUGGS
Possibly yes That is one of the
possible consequences of your testifying
here today Thats right

WIGAND
How does onegotojail What
does my family do Go on welfare If my
wife has to work Whos going to look
after the kids Put food on the table
My children need me If Im not

(at watch)
Guys Ive got to go Im gonna be late

later Dr Wigand good luck

He leaves And Jeffreys quiet frightened Having shaken
the departing Moores hand he now turns away from Scruggs
and Motley thinking about consequences

RICHARD SCRUGGS
I know what youre facing Jeff And I
think I know how youre feeling

Jeffreys skeptical anybody could know how it is

RICHARD SCRUGGS (CONTD)

A white traditional Southern house with a veranda and
gablesa large front lawn with weeping willows And we see
Lowell hands in his pockets not an insider or an outsider
waiting alone on the expansive lawn The front door opens

A Mississippi State Trooper putting on his round brimmed hat
comes out and crosses the driveway Then Jeffrey coming out
with Motley Motley talks to him on the veranda for a moment
and then heads towards his car Meanwhile Jeffrey comes
down over to Lowell on the lawn

And Jeffrey looks off across the street from the house at
the Gulf And we see the street is blockaded by Mississippi
State Police cars An armed camp Other men in suits
Lawyers and state officials wait Ron Motley gets in his
car and drives away

LOWELL
You attract a crowd

WIGAND
(smiles wry)
Yeah great

LOWELL
I heard about the Kentucky gag order

WIGAND
I dont know what to do

And theyre quiet a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their
coats He looks out at the water a cargo container ship
passing by He watches its slow progress

And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn hands
in his pockets shoulders bent head down thinking And
Richard Scruggs comes out tying his tie to wait beside
Lowell

and historically

WIGAND
(severely conflicted)
I cant seem to findthe criteria to
decide Its too big a decision to make
without being resolvedin my own mind

Theyre quiet Jeffrey getting nowhere Lowell offers

LOWELL
Maybe things have changed

Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future And
something just got resolved He asks Lowell rhetorically

WIGAND

WIGAND
No I mean since whenever

Nothings changed Wigand looks at them He found his own
answer
WIGAND (CONTD)

Dr Wigand I am instructing you
(to Wigand)

not to answer that question in

contractual obligations undertaken by you
not to disclose any information about
your work at the Brown and Williamson
Tobacco Company And in accordance with
the force and effect of the temporary
restraining order that has been entered
against you to by the court in the State of

Yes It produces a physiological
response which meets the definition of a
drug Nicotine is associated with
impact with satisfaction It has a
pharmacological effect that crosses the
blood-brain barrier intact

MOTLEY
Thank you Doctor Thank you

EXT THE SCRUGGS HOUSE PASCAGOULA MISSISSIPPI - NIGHT

Lowell stands on the porch looking out at the rain Theres
a slight sound He turns And Jeffreys come outside He
stands leaning on the porch railing looking out at the rain
and windswept trees Theyre quiet They share a look
They nod to each other The smallest nod of accomplishment
And theyre there on the porch alone outside the house in
Pascagoula Mississippi

INT CBS EDITING ROOM NEW YORK - AFTERNOON

We see Lowell unusually buoyant in the same clothes as
yesterday Hes working with Tony Baldo on a cut of the
show the net result of his architecture of events his
combination of persuasion and integrity

We see on the Avid monitor a single of Jeffrey

WIGAND

(on monitor)
Part of the reason Im here is I felt
that their representation clearly at

least within

LOWELL
Run that Sandefur piece on nicotines
not addictive Run that on-camera
Then cut right to Wigand with I believe
they perjured Then go wide to the
CEOs all taking the oath Back on Jeff
and play the pause after the word felt
on the B-side

Widen to include Debbie DeLuca the Intern two other

Editors Felling They have gathered behind Lowell in the
doorway This is a hot show and its generated excitement
among Lowells co-workers And while Baldo cuts we see
INT CBS CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EDITING ROOM - DAY

the group has spilled out the doorway watching Lowells
story come together Beyond them approaching is Mike
Wallace coming to work

BILL FELLING
(leaving)
-helluva show Mike Explosive
material

People separate as Mike pushes in Lowell sees Mike While
Tony Baldo is making the edits on the Avid

LOWELL
(to Mike)
It went great in Mississippi Mike

MIKE WALLACE
Good

Don Hewitt enters from the corridor without jacket

DON HEWITT
I heard Wigands deposition got sealed

LOWELL
Yeah they argued he was going to reveal
the secret formula of Kools to the
world

(seriously)

Sealed doesnt hurt Scruggs
litigation and since were the only ones
with the story I believe were sitting
on an exclusive

MIKE WALLACE
I like that

DON HEWITT
Corporate has some questions Weve got
a meeting at Black Rock first thing in
the morning

LOWELL
Whens the air date

DEBBIE DELUCA
(to Lowell)
Excuse me Lowell Sharons on line 3
LOWELL
Tell her Ill call her back in ten

BALDO
Here we go

Baldo now runs Lowells edit of the above sequence And we
SEE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT

Sandefur in CLOSE-UP states I believe that nicotine is not
addictive Wigand in matching CLOSE-UP states I believe he
perjured himself Then all seven CEOs of Big Tobacco stand
up and raise their hands and take an oath in front of
Congress to tell the truth while Wallace says the whole
line of people the whole line of CEOs up there all
swearing that And Wigand says off-screen with great
emphasis Part of the reason Im here is I FELTand it
cuts to Wigand for a pause that makes the word FELT resound
and then he goes on to say on-camera that their
representation clearly misstated what they commonly knew
Were a nicotine delivery business We see the combination
of art and truth woven into impact that has an audacity
thats stirring and beautiful

EXT LOUISVILLE - DUSK

We see an anonymous rental car moving through downtown
Louisville

INT THE RENTAL CAR - NIGHT

ts Jeffrey in the front seat driven by one of his security
men Hes coming home under the cover of darkness They
pass a FLAMING CAR on the freeway shoulder Jeffrey turns to
stare at it They turn off onto city streets and stop at a
light Jeffreys nervous Jeffrey instinctively turns A
Police Car stops alongside The Policeman looks at him

Eyes meet Jeffrey looks away The signal takes forever

t changes And as the Police Car moves off

EXT WIGANDS HOUSE - NIGHT

up the walk and the Second Security Guard quickly crosses
the lawn to intercept him

And Jeff opens the door going inside anxious to be home
INT WIGANDS HOUSE - NIGHT

The house is quiet dark Too quiet Too dark Something
isnt right He crosses to one of the childrens roomsthe
master bedroom The lights are on Both rooms are empty

He goes into the kitchen and sees a note thats been left for

INT THE CONFERENCE ROOM CBS - DAY

Were at a table Mike and Lowell laugh at some joke while
HELEN CAPERELLI CBS GENERAL COUNSEL enters with the
President of CBS News ERIC KLUSTER

HELEN CAPERELLI
Shall I send for coffee Sorry Im late

MIKE WALLACE
No no were fine

HELEN CAPERELLI
Are you sure

Also there is Don Hewitt Caperelli is too well put
together too practiced too polished

They nod They dont need coffee

HELEN CAPERELLI (CONTD)

Alright I thought wed get together
because theres a legal concept that has
been getting some new attention recently
tortious interference

(beat)
If two people have an agreement like a
confidentiality agreement and one of
them breaks it because they are induced
to do so by a 3rd party the 3rd party
can be sued for damages for

interferinghence tortious
interference
DON HEWITT

Interfering Thats what we do

LOWELL

I think what were trying to tell you is
that it happens all the time This is a
news organization People are always
telling us things they shouldnt We
have to verify if its true and in the
public interest And if it is we air
it
MIKE WALLACE
After we corroborate it Thats why
weve never lost a lawsuit and run a
classy show
(impatient now)
Anything else

HELEN CAPERELLI
And 60 Minutes verification is exact
And precise And I dont think it would
hurt to make sure youre righton this
one

DON HEWITT
Why You think we have liability
Whats the CBS News position Eric

ERIC KLUSTER
Theres a possibility its rather
remote

HELEN CAPERELLI
But one we have to check on Mike Ive
retained outside counsel to do exactly
that On a segment I might add thats
already rife with problems

LOWELL
What does that mean Rife with --

HELEN CAPERELLI
Im told unusual promises were made to
Wigand

LOWELL
No only that we would hold the story
until it was safe for him

HELEN CAPERELLI
(cuts in)
And Im told there are questions as to
our star witness veracity

LOWELL
(trying to control his anger)
His veracity was good enough for the
State of Mississippi

HELEN CAPERELLI
(historic)
Our standards have to be higher than
anyone elses because we are the
standardfor everyone else
Whatever that means

LOWELL
(wry)
Well as a standardIll hang with
is the guy telling the truth

HELEN CAPERELLI
Well with tortious interference Im
afraidthe greater the truth the
greater the damage

LOWELL
Come again

HELEN CAPERELLI
They own the information hes disclosing
The truer it is the greater the damage
to them If he lied he didnt disclose
their information And the damages are
smaller

LOWELL
Is this Alice in Wonderland

MIKE WALLACE
You said on this one What about this
one

And Lowell hears a changed note in Wallaces voice After a
beat

HELEN CAPERELLI
(familiar seductive)
If this holds up and it very well may
not Mikebut if it did And we aired
this segment And CBS was sued by Brown
and Williamson I think we could be at
grave risk

MIKE WALLACE
(a beat)
How grace

HELEN CAPERELLI
(and shes been waiting for
this)
Well at the end of the daybecause of
your segmentthe Brown and Williamson
Tobacco Companycould own CBS
As if on cue the alarm on Helen Caperellis watch beeps
She glances at it

HELEN CAPERELLI (CONTD)
You know I am sorry But Im due
upstairs

She gets up gathering her things

LOWELL
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not
go to air with this story

HELEN CAPERELLI
Youre getting ahead of yourself Were
all in this together Were all CBS
Well find out soon Thank you
gentlemen

And taking up her briefcase she leaves Don and Mike rise

LOWELL
Tortious interference Sounds like a
disease caught by a radio

DON HEWITT
(to Mike)
Lunch

MIKE WALLACE
Sure
(to Lowell)
Dont worry we call the shots around
here

Lowell finds himself angry and alone He crosses to the
window and pulls out his cell phone and goes to work

DEBBIE DELUCAS VOICE (OVER)

Hello
LOWELL
(into phone)
Debbie its me I want you to check

some filings and give me John Wilsons
number at Bear-Stern

INT CBS HEWITTS OFFICE - DAY

LOWELL
What now
DON HEWITT
Klusters coming over

Hewitts on an unrelated call Lowell crosses to look out
the window a manila folder (the filing) under his arm with
whatever he found out like a bomb feels distant from these
people The door opens and Eric Kluster the President of
CBS News enters

ERIC KLUSTER
Hello Lowell Mike Don

Hewitt hangs up the phone

ERIC KLUSTER (CONTD)
There has been so much soul searching
about this Wigand Ive decided we should
cut an alternate version of the show
without his interview

LOWELL
So what happened to Ms Caperellis
checking with outside counsel first all
that crap

ERIC KLUSTER
Thats happening And hopefully we
wont have to use the alternate but we
should have it in the can

LOWELL
Im not touching my film

ERIC KLUSTER
Im afraid you are

LOWELL
No Im not

ERIC KLUSTER
Were doing this with or without you
Lowell If you like I can assign
another producer to edit your show

Lowells stunned He looks like hes been hit with a
hammer

LOWELL
Since when has the paragon of
investigative journalism allowed lawyers
to determine the news content on 60
Minutes

DON HEWITT
Its an alternate version So what if we
have an alternate version And I dont
think her being cautious is so damned
unreasonable

ERIC KLUSTER
(wry)
So now if youll excuse me gentlemen
Mr Rathers been complaining about his
chair again
(laughter)

As they start to leave

LOWELL
(mild)
Before you go

And Lowell takes out

LOWELL (CONTD)
I discovered this SEC filing
(he gets their attention)
For the sale of the CBS Corporation to
Westinghouse Corporation

MIKE WALLACE
What

DON HEWITT
Yeah I heard rumors

LOWELL

Its not a rumor Its a sale

(rhetorical answer)
If Tisch can unload CBS for 81 a share
to Westinghouse and then is suddenly
threatened with a multibillion-dollar
lawsuit from Brown and Williamson that
could screw up the sale could it not

ERIC KLUSTER
(serene)
And what are you implying

LOWELL
(to Kluster)
Im not implying Im quoting More
vested interests
(reading from SEC filing)
Persons Who Will Profit From This
Merger

(beat)
Ms Helen Caperelli General Counsel of
CBS News 39 million Mr Eric Kluster
President of CBS News 14 million

DON HEWITT
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are
influenced by money

LOWELL
Oh no of course theyre not influenced
by money They work for free And you
are a Volunteer Executive Producer

DON HEWITT
CBS does not do that And youre
questioning our journalistic integrity

LOWELL
No Im questioning your hearing You
hear reasonable and tortious

interference I hear Potential
Brown and Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing
the sale of CBS to Westinghouse I
hear Shut the segment down Cut
Wigand loose Obey orders And fuck
off Thats what I hear

DON HEWITT

Youre exaggerating

LOWELL
I am You pay me to go get guys like
Wigand to draw him out To get him to
trust us to get him to go on television
I do I deliver him He sits He
talks He violates his own fucking
confidentiality agreement And hes only
the key witness in the biggest public
health reform issue maybe the biggest
most-expensive corporate-malfeasance case
in US history And Jeffrey Wigand
whos out on a limb does he go on
television and tell the truth Yes
Is it newsworthy Yes Are we gonna air
it Of course not Why Because hes
not telling the truth No Because he
is telling the truth Thats why were
not going to air it And the more truth
he tells the worse it gets

DON HEWITT
You are a fanatic An anarchist You
know that If we cant have a whole
show then I want half a show rather than
no show But oh no not you You wont
be satisfied unless youre putting the
company at risk

LOWELL
Cmon what are you And are you a
businessman Or are you a newsman
Because that happens to be what Mike and
I do for a living
