DEVIL IN A BLUE DRESS

Written by

From the novel by

March 9 1994 - 3rd Draft

1 INT CHAMPION AIRCRAFT - BENNY GIACOMOS OFFICE

A battered wooden desk drawer groans open and light brown
skinned hands with dirty fingernails twist the cap off a
pint of rye whiskey and pour liquor into a coffee cup

0S VOICE
You know when you fire somebody
you have to stick to your guns

They screw the cap back on and lay the bottle in the drawer

0S VOICE
(continuing)
The men might get to thinkin that
Im weak if I take you back

The cup rises to the face of BENNY GIACOMO late forties
with salt and pepper hair that was once jet black Skin
darker than a Louisiana Creole

He takes a sip and bares his teeth in a grimace from the
whiskey As he talks we gradually see more of him -- feet
kicked up on the desk fully in charge

A Betty Grable like pin-up girl is giving us background in
more ways than one in a swimsuit and high heels on a
calendar tacked to the wall May 1948

BENNY
(continuing)
And I didnt tell Dupree that Id
give you your job back All I
said was that Id be glad to talk
to you if you said the right
thing Do you have something to
say

A stream of cigarette smoke snakes through as the back of a
mans head and shoulder nudges in and shifts nervously

MAN
Mr Giacomo when one of the white
guys has come off a double shift
and says hes too tired to work
overtime you dont fire him

BENNY
Fella whatd I tell ya If youre
not willing to give a little extra
Champion cant use you

EASY RAWLINS thirty handsome and a much darker brown than
Giacomo takes a drag off a Chesterfield cigarette

Through the window behind him a team of men pour over a
partly assembled airplane their voices echoing in the
hangar that surrounds the office

Benny measures out his words one at a time

BENNY (0S)
Now Do you have
something to say

Easy swallows his frustration in silence and thinks about
swallowing his pride as well And then

EASY
I want my job back Mr Giacomo I
need to work and I need a good job

BENNY (0S)
Is that all

Easy looks down into the smoke and sits up straight to keep
from bowing his head

EASY
No thats not all I need money
so that I can pay my mortgage and
eat I need a house to live in
and a place to raise children I
need to buy clothes so I can--

BENNY
Im sorry fella but I gotta get
back to work

And he swings his feet down and stands up to go But Easy
is up too blocking his way out the door

EASY
Ezekiel Mr Giacomo

BENNY
Hunh
EASY
My name is Ezekiel Ezekiel
Rawlins

Benny clinches his fists and focuses on Easys chest like a
fighter And Easy rocks back on one foot ready to score a
field goal with his right knee

Slowly Giacomos face creases into a plastic grin and he
shrugs

BENNY
Scuse me Ezekiel

And he walks around Easy shaking his head as if amused

Easy watches him go as the low moan of the baritone sax from
Duke Ellingtons Absinthe snakes up like sin and we

FADE TO BLACK

And watch the titles the last one reading Two Weeks
Later

FADE IN
EXT JOPPYS BAR - DAY
Black and grey cars Packards and Buicks from 1928 to 1948

come and go on Central Avenue Two-storied storefronts with
canvas awnings above black men and women in hats all in
a hurry

The Red Car rumbles through and then a white Cadillac
convertible pulls to the curb in front of a butcher shop

Above the shop on the next floor are large partly open
windows with JOPPYS BAR in boldface letters Inside sits
Easy back to the window reading the classified ads

INT JOPPYS BAR

T-Bone Walkers Westside Baby plays on the jukebox as Easy
takes a final drag off his cigarette and stubs it out

THE FRONT PAGE of the LOS ANGELES TIMES lies face up on the
table beneath the ashtray displaying A PHOTOGRAPH of a
middle-aged white man and his pretty young woman companion
smiling and waving

Above the happy couple is a headline CARTER DROPS OUT OF
RACE The caption under the photo reads Wealthy civic
leader Todd Carter shown here with his lovely bride-to-be
Daphne Monet at a fundraiser last month was unavailable for
comment on his surprising withdrawal from the Mayors race

0S VOICE
Catch ya later Joppy

BACK TO SCENE

SPLACK An older black man hitching up his pants underneath
a bloodstained butchers apron has slapped his empty beer
glass down hard on the counter on his way out

JOPPY
Hey watch the marble Dammit
whatd I tell you

The fifty-year-old burly bartender leans over his big
stomach checking for cracks and buffing the veiny marble top
of the bar with a filthy rag Behind him is a yellow
billboard from 1932 with big black letters reading Fuller
vs Shag 10 ROUND MAIN EVENT We could make out more of
the poster and the eight-by-ten framed boxing photos around
it if it wasnt so smoky in the place

EASY
Joppy how much they payin out
there at McDonell Douglas

JOPPY
I dont know Dont it say--

His words hang as his eyes stray toward the door
Easy looks up also at

THE DOORWAY which fills with the large frame of the white
MAN in an off-white linen suit his pale eyes surveying the
room Satisfied that all but two of the six tables in the
tiny room are unoccupied he smiles at Joppy and walks to
the far end of the bar

Easy is surprised to see Joppy tough ex-heavyweight that he
is duck his head and smile as he makes his way over like
hes answering a summons The white man extends a friendly
hand and the two of them shake like old friends and lean in
close to talk in private

Easy finds it hard not to watch their conversation as he
takes a sip from a short glass of bourbon on the rocks
After a moment

JOPPY
Easy come on over here This
heres somebody I want ya to
meet Come on This heres a
friend of mine

Easy drains his glass and stands up then walks over

JOPPY
Yeah Easy This heres Mr
Albright
ALBRIGHT

EASY
How ya doin

JOPPY
(bowing and grinning)
Mr Albright and me goes back to

before the war when I was still in
the fight game

ALBRIGHT
(to Easy)
Ever seen this guy fight Any
time Joppy Shag stepped in the ring
you knew you were gonna see some
real knock-down-drag-out-
fisticuffs Where you from Easy

EASY
(awkwardly)
Houston

ALBRIGHT
Houston Joppys hometown

Joppy pours Albright a straight shot of Wild Turkey and the
big man sips it

ALBRIGHT
So I hear you need a job

Easy throws a look at Joppy but Joppy is busy buffing the
bar and putting more of Easys business in the street

JOPPY
Aw yeah Easy always tryin to do

certificate from night school
Hes threatenin up on some
college And hes one of the few
colored men around here who owns
his own house Shoot he pays a
mortgage every month just like a
white man

ALBRIGHT
Property owner hunh

He turns up his drink and sets the empty glass down on the

counter

ALBRIGHT
(continuing)
These big companies dont give a
damn do they
He reaches in his coat pocket and produces a business card
and scribbles something on it

ALBRIGHT
(continuing)
If you need a job drop by this
address at seven tonight

Easy takes the card and glances at it

EASY
What kind of work you do

ALBRIGHT
I do favors I do favors for
friends Drop by

He nods to Joppy and walks out the door

EASY
Who the hell is that Joppy

JOPPY

EASY

JOPPY
Oh I dont ask him all that He
comes in here every so often

job for him He pays good

JOPPY

(continuing)

keep your eyes open for somebody
Hell pay you whether you see

Easy is still suspicious but cant take his eyes off the

card

5 EXT EASYS

EASY (V0O)
When somebody tells me Dont

Albright didnt bother to pay for
his drink

Little single family houses with tiny yards of St Augustine
grass rush toward the amber Indianhead hood ornament on

Easys car

Duke Ellingtons Mood Indigo plays on the radio as Easy
heads for home in thought

EASY (VO)

(continuing)
DeWitt Albright reminded me of
somebody I knew back in Houston
His name was Raymond Alexander but
we called him Mouse Mouse called
hisself a businessman too And I
found out that I shouldnt be
nowhere around when Mouse got down
to his business I learned that
the hard way

A neighbor sweeps out her front porch and waves at Easy as
he slows down in front of his house

He gets out of his car and a group of children chasing a man
giving goat cart rides washes past him in the street

A MAN with an unruly head of hair and full beard pushing a
wheelbarrow with a double edged axe wheels up behind Easy as
he opens his gate

WOODCUTTER
Want me to knock down some of them
trees back there for you

EASY
(irritated)
No Just leave the trees alone

Easy continues up his walkway past flower beds of dahlias
and wild roses and stops on his front porch to check on his
African violets in a jar next to the front door

INT EASYS HOUSE

He walks into his tiny living room and tosses his jacket
onto the sofa Then moves on through the kitchen and out
the back door

EXT EASYS HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

He picks up a water hose and turns on the faucet watering
and admiring his apple avocado pomegranate and banana
trees as he lights a cigarette

EASY (VO)
I had moved to Los Angeles right
after the war with three hundred
dollars and the GI Bill And I
liked coming home to a place that
was mine According to President
Truman I had that comin to me
cause I had fought in the good
war against Hitler in Europe
But that didnt mean a damn thing
to a lotta white folks including

the foreman on my job So here I

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

Easy parks in front of a large Spanish-style building He
gets out and walks to the black wrought iron entrance

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

Easy makes his way through the overgrown patio with roses
and vines cascading down from office windows on the second

floor

INT OFFICE - NIGHT

Someone is watching Easy as he looks for the right office

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

A small white MAN pops out from behind a hedge startling
Easy He wears a suit that also serves as a uniform

SECURITY GUARD
Well did he Because if he

EASY

Disgusted Easy turns to leave

SECURITY GUARD
Hold on

He sizes up Easy and then points across the courtyard
SECURITY GUARD
(like an order)
Across that way to the left and
down the stairs
Easy half nodshalf glares and walks away
13 OMIT 13

At the other side of the garden Easy turns a corner and

heads down concrete steps At the bottom he opens a door
leading into

INT BASEMENT - CORRIDOR 14

He looks into the boiler room but turns into an empty
corridor stopping at a heavy steel door at the end

He knocks After a moment a tall and slight MAN with curly
brown hair and the complexion of an East Indian opens the door

INT MAINTENANCE ROOM 15

A short and stocky kind of Chinese-looking MAN stands
against the door at the far end The Tall Man ushers Easy
into the clutter of heavy metal tools cans of paint and
cleaning solutions A card table with two chairs sits idly
The Tall Man closes the door and holds out his hand Easy
reaches to shake it but the man starts to pat Easy on his
side and Easy pushes him away

15

EASY
Hey man Whats wrong with you

The Chinese Man slips a hand inside his coat and the Tall
Man smiles

TALL MAN
(with an accent)
Mr Rawlins put your hands up a
little from your sides please

EASY
Keep your hands to yourself I
dont let no man feel on me like
that

The Chinese Man pulls some kind of weapon halfway out and
takes a step forward and the Tall Man tries to put his hand
against Easys chest but Easy grabs his wrist

TALL MAN
Dont worry Manny Hes okay
Just a little shaky
(indicating the door)
Let him know

Manny pushes his weapon back in his coat and knocks on the

door behind him
After a moment DeWitt Albright opens up

ALBRIGHT
(smiling)
Easy

TALL MAN
He doesnt want us to touch him

ALBRIGHT
Leave it Shariff I just wanted
to make sure he was solo

SHARIFF
Youre the boss

ALBRIGHT
You guys can go now Easy and I
have some business

INT MAINTENANCE OFFICE 16

Easy follows Albright inside and the big man goes behind a
big wooden desk and puts his bone-colored shoes up next to a
half full bottle of Wild Turkey On the other end of the
desk a small radio scratches out the Glen Gray Orchestras
Gotta Be This or That

16

There is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him
with a picture of a basket of blackberries but other than
that the room is bare

ALBRIGHT
Have a seat Mr Rawlins

Easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries
not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under
Albrights arm with the muzzle of the pistol almost reaching
his belt

EASY
(gesturing back)
Your friends hunh

ALBRIGHT
Like you Easy I need a little

help I give em a call Drink

EASY
Sure

Albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours
a fresh one for Easy and fresher one for himself

Easy nods

of whiskey

ALBRIGHT
One thing I like about working for
myself I always have a bottle on
the table You wanna drink with
me Fine You dont Doors
right behind you Joppy tells me
youre a war hero Said you went
in with Patton

proud but polite and Albright pushes him a glass

ALBRIGHT
So you want the job

EASY
Depends on what kind of job I
dont want to get mixed up in
nothing

ALBRIGHT
Walk out the door in the morning
Easy and youre mixed up in
something Only thing that matters
is if youre mixed up to the top or
not 16

EASY
I mean I dont wanna get mixed up
with the law

ALBRIGHT
Neither one of us wants to get
mixed up in that Thats just rich
people trying to keep me and you in
our place

He laughs and takes a healthy swig and Easy takes a drink

too
ALBRIGHT
Im looking for somebody for a
friend

He pushes a newspaper across the desk to Easy and Easy holds
it up

NEWS PAPER

Its the front page with the photograph of the wealthy Todd
Carter and his beautiful bride-to-be Despite her smile
theres a sadness in the eyes

ALBRIGHT (0S)

Daphne Monet fiancée of Todd
Carter one of the richest men in
town Been gone for two weeks

BACK TO SCENE

EASY
She leave him

ALBRIGHT
Evidently You know how it is
with women Easy Happens to the

best of us

He rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of
recognition

EASY
I aint never heard of her before
I wouldnt know how to find a woman
like that

ALBRIGHT
Thats a shame

He laughs a conspiratorial lechers laugh and Easy allows a
smile

16 ALBRIGHT
See Daphne has a predilection for
the company of Negroes She likes
jazz and pigs feet and dark meat
know what I mean

The insult takes Easy off guard but he shouldve known

EASY
So you think she might be down in
Watts

ALBRIGHT

Im sure of it But I cant go
looking for her myself because Im
not of the right persuasion so to
speak Ive been asking Joppy for
over a week but all he could do
was introduce me to you

EASY
What do you want me to do

ALBRIGHT
Just get a location on her Mr
Carter wants to make up with her

EASY
Thats all
ALBRIGHT
(smiling)
Thats all

He pulls out a brown secretary-type wallet and counts out 10
ten-dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey

ALBRIGHT

One hundred dollars and I pay in

advance

Easy eyes the money All he has to do is pick it up

EASY

I just have to tell you where she

is
ALBRIGHT

Thats right And keep it you
know confidential

He freshens Easys drink and Easy eyes the money some more

ALBRIGHT
Joppy tells me you used to frequent
an illegal club down on Eighty-
ninth and Central Somebody saw
Daphne there a few nights ago You
could start tonight

Easy takes a drink and looks again at the money
EXT JOHNS PLACE (MARKET) - NIGHT

Stripped down to its dark naked self Central Avenue has
drawn a crowd from all over town Neon glistens off slick
pomade and silk clings to the contours of simmering flesh

An outrage to police even before the era of Police Chief
Parkers personal crusade a squad car sits idling while two
dicks in blue manhandle a brother in a grey sharkskin zoot
suit prodding and whapping with nightsticks searching for
something -- anything -- because his date is a young white
woman A few onlookers stand back watching but since this
white woman is not Daphne Monet Easy only glances and walks
inside

INT JOHNS BAR

Easy sees his fifth white MAN that day in a disheveled but
expensive dark blue suit staggering toward him reeking of
gin

DRUNK
Hey colored brother I need you
to do somethin for me--

OS WOMANS VOICE
Go on Whatd I tell you about
hair-assing my customers

Easy looks over to see HATTIE PARSONS the small brown-
skinned manager of the place glaring daggers at the drunk
man while watching the commotion out the window

Easy starts over toward Hattie and the drunk turns and tries
to grab Easys arm But his desperation causes him to trip
and he winds up sitting against the wall

Easy steps over him and joins Hattie at the window

HATTIE
I just paid these damn cops and
they still roustin my customers

A hint of a smile appears on Juniors face

JUNIOR

Easy grins and shakes his head

EASY

Easy turns to glare at Junior and the surly field hand slaps
his thigh and roars with laughter as he closes the door
After all these years the two men still hate each other
20 INT JOHNS SPEAKEASY

Easy looks around to see couples trying to dance finding
themselves wrestling between tables packed with five and six

people each

He heads for the bar pointing a finger at a man in a black
silk shirt and a foot-high pompadour hairdo

EASY
Alphonso Jenkins

ALPHONSO flashes pearls

ALPHONSO

Hey Easy

EASY
Hey man you seen a girl named
Dahlia or somethin White girl

ALPHONSO

Easy claps him on the shoulder and waves at skinny RITA COOK
who is sitting at a table with five MEN

RITA
Hey Baby

EASY
Hey Rita
(under his breath)
What do they see in you

Finally Easy spots a fifty-year-old MAN in an old grey
tweed jacket sitting in a corner at a table by himself
Looking like the God fearing all fearing Baptist deacon
that he is -- he is as out of place as a whore in church as
he nervously gazes about the room and massacres a plate of
barbecued ribs

Easy leans over the counter to the bartender

EASY
Hey Lewis Gimme a couple glasses
and a pail of ice and send a quart
of bourbon over there to Odells

table

Lewis scoops up ice into a small bucket and plops it onto
the bar with two short glasses

Easy lays a dollar on the counter and carries the set up
over to the corner as he watches

Easy stops at Odells table

suite with blue pinstripes and a ten-gallon hat

DUPREE
You aint jumped outta no windows

EASY

Not yet Dupree

DUPREE

He has her in tow like a toy wagon and she offers a coy
smile Short and roundish with cherry-brown skin she leads
with her bosom

EASY

Coretta rests her sloe-eyes on Easy and Odell and the church
going man almost chokes

ODELL

DUPREE
You know Benny just wants you to
say youre sorry Easy And hell

EASY
Im a sorry man all right Any
man without his paycheck is sorry Dupree laughs smacking the table so hard it rattles like an
earthquake And Corettas smile ignites like a slow fuse
causing Easy to feel it all the way down his spine

A man with his hair marcelled back swoops in and pulls a
quart of Old Crow from his overcoat and sits it on the
table

Easy reaches for his wallet but Dupree beats him to it
DUPREE

I got it Easy Your money aint
no good up in here

EASY

Coretta frowns at Dupree as Easy counts out three dollars

And he peels

Odell shakes his head no and Coretta looks away as if
insulted leaving silence until

DUPREE

phone company

He squeezes his woman in close and Coretta softens up and
burns that smile again

Easy grins and nods congratulations

THE BOTTLE

Its less than a quarter full now because its three hours

later

BACK TO SCENE

Johns is onl

The jukebox

echoes Lena Hornes Prisoner of Love and Dupree leans back

in his chair

snoring -- mouth wide open
Odell gets up and starts to amble off

EASY
Hey you goin home Odell

Concentrating totally on keeping his balance Odell waves
feebly without looking back

Easy is droopy-eyed from the booze but Coretta just looks a
little sexier She straightens Duprees hat on his head and
twists up her nose

CORETTA
He used to play till the cock
crowed But that ole cock dont
crow nearly so much now

She levels her perpetual come on onto Easy and he nods
sluggishly and lifts himself to his feet

EASY
Think Im gonna head out

CORETTA
You be sorry if you go

She slides her hand inside her blouse and discreetly lifts
her bodice to air her breasts

EASY
I think Id be more sorry if I
stay
He turns to go
CORETTA

Daphne sleep by now You cant get
none of that tonight

Easy turns and Coretta plays with the ice in her glass

CORETTA

Coretta leans back and fans her bosom

Easy struggles with Dupree and Coretta gives him a hand as
they drag him from Easys car to her front door the big
mans feet plowing two deep furrows in the lawn

INT CORETTAS HOUSE
Coretta pushes the door open and Easy hauls him in

CORETTA
Throw him in there on the bed

Easy pulls and pushes Duprees dead weight into
THE BEDROOM

CORETTA
Throwed him outta his place cause

Finally Easy manages to pile Dupree onto the bed and then
stands up panting and sweating

Coretta strolls up to Easy pressing her body against his

CORETTA
Why you keep askin bout her

She undoes a button on his shirt and kisses his chest and
unbuttons another working her way down Easy sweats harder
than when he was lifting Dupree

EASY
What if he hears somethin

CORETTA (0S)

ON THE SOFA - MINUTES LATER

CORETTA
Oh yeah daddy You hittin my

The top of her dress undone Coretta is straddling Easy who
is hitting her spot and his too in a rhythm Eyes

closed he bites his lip to hold in the ecstasy so as not to
awaken Dupree who is sawing logs -- shredding em -- in the
bedroom

Suddenly Coretta tears herself off of him and sits back on
his knees Easy writhes and shakes like a power line
shorting out

CORETTA
(coy shy)
Oooh thats just too good Easy

Easy tries to pull her back but she twists down to the

floor

CORETTA
I cant give up that much love
daddy not the way things is 24
EASY

(out loud)
What things

She shushes him with a finger and twists her head toward the

bedroom

CORETTA
You know Duprees right there in
the next room

EASY
(full voice)

Coretta quiets him again and he comes back to his senses

CORETTA

Oh yeah I aint after her

EASY
Who cares what man I dont want

He pulls her toward him but she pushes him away

CORETTA
But Daphnes my friend--

Frustrated he sits back against the sofa and Coretta
sensing that he is snapping out of her spell slides forward
onto him giving him her spot again And within moments

they are back at it CORETTA
Oh baby Oh daddy you hittin
my spot Oh yeah

EASY (V0O)
I went on hittin her spot until
just before sun-up

The sky is light purple as Easy stumbles down Corettas
porch She waves half-heartedly and closes the door as he
straightens his clothes and looks around for any witnesses
on his way to his car

Easys Pontiac pulls to a stop in front and he gets out

EASY (VO)
It occurred to me that Coretta had
found out a lot more about what I
was up to than I had wanted her to
But I had found out that the rich
mans woman had a colored

boyfriend It had cost me a
sawbuck to get Coretta to give me
that information Well lets

just say somethin had cost me ten
dollars

INT EASYS HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Golden morning light streams in through the window
Outside a dog is barking at a bird on the fence

Coffee percolates on the stove and Easy walks over and pours
himself a cup He moves to the breakfast table and sits

down by the window looking out onto the street as he opens
up a blue envelope in a stack of mail

Gradually he begins to silently mouth the words and sits up
his eyes getting bigger until he finds himself reading
aloud

EASY
Since Etta Mae has left me and I
am a bachelor I figured I could
come out and visit and we burn down

the town

EASY (CONTD)
Write me and tell me whens a good
time

EXT EASYS HOUSE - DAY 28
Easy waters his lawn in deep thought
EASY (V0O)
The letter from Mouse was worrying
me in more ways than one All I
had to do was call Albright to earn
the hundred dollars I already had
in my pocket But the last time I
got money that easy I got it from
Mouse -- fifty dollars -- And the
next day I had to join the Army to
leave town
FLASHBACK
INT STOLEN CAR - NIGHT 29

A younger Easy is driving his hair greased up high in a
pompadour with a pencil line moustache framing his top lip

A man in a wide brim Homburg hat looks away out the
passenger window

MAN

Lets dump this damn thing

EASY
(suddenly alarmed)
This aint your friends car

MOUSE
(still looking away)

The drone of the engine takes us
BACK TO SCENE 30

A TRUCK with a whole familys belongings tied down onto a
flatbed rolls up A WOMAN and a bunch of KIDS fill up the
cab

WOMAN

EASY
Where you goin Sophie

WOMAN

me out here
She waves and keeps on trucking

He watches her wistfully and then catches sight of

THE WOODCUTTER across the street in a neighbors front yard
axe in hand about to swing on a lemon tree

EASY
Get away from there

He picks up a rock and throws it and then chucks another
sending the scruffy vagabond wheeling his barrow off down
the street

Easy shuts off the water and walks back up on his porch He
picks up a glass of lemonade that sits at the foot of a
chair on top of

A NEWSPAPER

A front page heading reads CARTERS WITHDRAWAL LEAVES TERAN
ON TOP Below it

A PHOTOGRAPH of a smiling Matthew Teran with lips too thick
for a white man getting out of a limousine

A35 EXT MALIBU PIER - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The lights from the pier can be seen in the distance as Easy
parks his car And the voices of teenagers in raucous
conversation can be heard above Glenn Millers big band
playing Silhouette In The Moonlight on the jukebox

Easy gets out and starts toward the pier

35 EXT MALIBU PIER - NIGHT

Easy walks past the hamburger stand and on to the railing
that looks out over the ocean

like theyve lost someone

BARBARAS SISTER

OS VOICE
Excuse me

Easy sees Albrights Panama hat appear behind Football

What do you want

And he whirls around to Albrights smiling face just in
time to see him pull that rifle-like pistol from inside his
coat leveling it at his eyes

ALBRIGHT
I want to see brains I want you
to die for me

Albright cocks the hammer It sounds like a bone breaking
and Barbara starts crying in her sisters arms

FOOTBALL
(quickly)

Easy nods but Albright is not satisfied

ALBRIGHT
The question is Are you sorry

FOOTBALL
Yessir

ALBRIGHT

Football starts crying

EASY
(to Albright)

He presses the barrel to the boys forehead and Football
goes down to his knees The other young men look on in
horror

ALBRIGHT
Son of a gun You were gonna do

THUNK He slaps the barrel of the pistol into the side of
the boys head Football screams and the others scatter ALBRIGHT
Sick bastard
THUNK He smacks him again and blood is everywhere
ALBRIGHT

Get out of here You call the
cops Ill kill ya

Football manages to stagger to his feet and stumbles away
into the darkness back out toward the parking lot

Albright wipes his gun with a handkerchief and slides it

back into the holster

ALBRIGHT
I dont think theyd dare call the
cops
(giggles)
But itll cost me a few bucks if
they do

He claps Easy on the back as if its all been in fun and
giggles like a kid on his way toward the hamburger stand

Easy looks at him numbly and tags alongside clutching his

anger in tightly clenched jaws

ALBRIGHT
What you got Easy

EASY
You sure no harm is gonna come to
that woman cause of me

Albright doesnt break stride

ALBRIGHT

Albright still grinning pulls out the brown secretary
and counts out more bills

ALBRIGHT
Heres another hundred

He shoves the money into Easys hand

ALBRIGHT

He starts into the screen door of the hamburger stand but
Easy declines

EASY

ALBRIGHT

around you like that War hero

off one by one before they got you
against the rail

EASY
I dont kill children

For some reason this is hilarious to Albright He throws
his head back and wheezes out an almost silent belly laugh
then winds down

ALBRIGHT

Take it easy

He disappears into the hamburger joint and Easy walks away
back toward his car

EXT EASYS HOUSE - NIGHT
Easy pulls in front of his house and notices a dark Ford
parked across the street as he gets out of his car

A tall skinny white MAN in a dark blue suit gets out just
ahead of his slightly shorter and heavyset FRIEND

Easy watches them as he moves toward his walkway

SKINNY MAN
Mr Rawlins

EASY
Yeah

They approach fast but cautiously the fat one with a hand
in his pocket

SKINNY MAN

spots on his wrinkled tan suit

MILLER

EASY

MASON

WHOMP Easy takes one to the diaphragm and as he doubles
over the fat detective slips the handcuffs on behind his

back

MASON

You got a right to fall down and
break your face nigger You got a
right to die

The two cops drag Easy to the car and dump him into the back
seat where he lies gagging as the car whisks away

INT POLICE STATION

Easys head sags down as hes dragged through the front door
past blurred blue bodies that talk

POLICEMAN (0S)

MILLER (0S)
Yeah we got him coming home
Nothing on im

A door opens and Easy finds himself being flung inside

INT INTERROGATION ROOM

On his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a
single bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum
floor

He crawls to one of the urine-stained corners and looks down
on a dry flat corpse of a mouse He pushes his shoulder
against the unpainted plaster until hes standing and then
stumbles over to the chair and sits He looks up at the

bare pipes that run along the ceiling dripping water and

at a window with criss-cross chairs instead of glass framing
overgrown branches and leaves pushing their way in

THE DOOR opens and Miller comes in first carrying a
notebook

MILLER
Ezekiel Rawlins

EASY
Yes sir

Mason follows and closes the door

MILLER
We can take off the cuffs if you
wanna cooperate

39

EASY
Im cooperating

Miller motions to Mason and he removes the cuffs

MILLER
Where were you this morning at
about five AM

EASY

He plants his foot in Easys chest and pushes him over
backwards

MASON
--this morning

Easy has caught himself and stands back up

EASY
I dont know I was out drinkin

I couldve been on my way home I

MASON

(wandering over)
He didnt look at a clock

WHOCK Easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep
his balance wiping away blood streaming down

MILLER
You were drinkin down on Eighty-
ninth and Central At an illegal

club called Johns werent you
Mason moves again but this time Easy turns to face him and
the fat man looks back with an innocent face his palms

turned up

MILLER

EASY

Mason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the
palm of his hand

MASON

out behind the station and put a
bullet in your head

MILLER
Now What time did you leave

Miller and Mason glance at each other and Mason kicks the
chair over toward Easy

MASON
Sit down

EASY
Why Im gonna sit down and you

But he sits down anyway

MILLER
Did you go back and see Miss James

But she wont be waking up

Easys face goes sick MILLER
(continuing)
Whered you go when you left Miss
James house

Easy is too stunned to answer

MASON
You heard him whered you go

Easy stares into space answering in barely a whisper

EASY
I went home with a hangover

CHOONK CHOONK Mason fires off two punches and Easy grabs
his wrists and pulls him down to the floor swinging around
straddling Mason sitting on his ass

Millers police special presses into Easys temple and
Miller speaks to him quietly deadly

MILLER
Get up slow Real fuckin slow or
you know whats gonna happen

Easy raises his hands and uncoils to his feet backing away
cautiously

Mason is winded and furious

MASON
Okay Lets take him out back

He gets to his feet and reaches for his gun but Miller
stops his hand

MILLER
No Lets go

MASON
Bullshit Im gonna blow his--

MILLER
Lets go

He pushes Mason toward the door

MASON
Son-of-a-bitch Son-of-a-bitch

They exit the door and Easy rubs at his bloody ear

EXT LA CITY JAIL - NIGHT
Easy walks down the steps of the station buttoning up his
top shirt button his hand cupped to his aching ear to keep
out the chill of the night air
The street is dark and deserted like a giant black alley

except for the black and white patrol car that sits at the
curb A taut-faced officer leans out the window

OFFICER
Hey Buddy Its a long walk
why dont you let us give youa

ride
Easy walks across the street off into the darkness
EXT FOURTH STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT
A snatch of MUSIC and LAUGHTER startles Easy as he trudges
home and a car full of teenagers shoots by And then
A BLACK CADILLAC LIMOUSINE
cruises up behind and drives alongside

VOICE FROM CAR
Hey you Ezekiel Rawlins
The window rolls down all the way and a white face ina
black cap appears in the window

CHAUFFEUR
Ezekiel hold on

Easy keeps walking

CHAUFFEUR
Come on fella Somebody in the
back wants to talk to you

EASY
I dont have time right now

He doubles his pace almost running

CHAUFFEUR
Jump in Well take you My boss
wants to talk to you

Easy cuts behind the limo and into the street headed for the
other side of the bridge but

41

The Cadillac whips a U-turn blocking his way in the middle
of the street while cars pass honking on either side The
tall angular chauffeur gets out of the car and holds up his
hands as if making peace

Easy starts to make another move to escape but

CHAUFFEUR
(continuing)
Come on If we wanted to hurt you
it would have already happened

He opens the back door and after a few moments Easy gets
in

42 INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

Easy settles into the seat with his back to the driver

Edith Piafs Parles Moi DAmour adds sugar to the strong
smell of cologne and the portly form of Matthew Teran sits

across from him with a small MEXICAN BOY in pajamas seated
next to him holding a small elephant

TERAN
I can see that the police roughed
you up a bit Thats a terrible
practice of theirs which has to
change Mr Rawlins Has to
change

He opens his gold cigarette case and offers Easy a
cigarette Easy accepts and Teran lights them both up

TERAN
(continuing)
She was beaten And died from a
heavy blow to the back of the head
Mr Rawlins

Easy begins to feel nauseous

TERAN
The evenings events have caught my
adopted son and I quite off
guard My household was asleep
when we got the call that the
police had a suspect in Coretta
James murder Did you know that
she was a friend of mine Mr
Rawlins

EASY
No I didnt Mr Teran

TERAN
Oh you know who I am

EASY
I read the papers Youre runnin
for mayor

TERAN
(correcting)
I am the next mayor Mr Rawlins
And luckily for you a friend of
the Negro When I arrived at the
station I knew right off that you
were being improperly detained as
is Corettas boyfriend Dupree
Brouchard Its this sort of thing
that my administration will not
tolerate Mr Rawlins Absolutely
will not

He sits back in his seat self righteously and offers a nod

of assurance and awaits Easys gratitude Then after a
moment
TERAN
(continuing)
Yes Coretta answered phones for

a while in my campaign office on
103rd and Western In fact my
people got her a job in the phone
company So when I heard what had
happened I got out of bed
immediately personally because of

my concern Was anyone there with
you Mr Rawlins besides Mr Dupree
Brouchard Any other friends

of Corettas

EASY
No sir

TERAN
No young lady perhaps

EASY
Nobody

TERAN
Of course not Mr Rawlins And
why should you tell a man whom
youve only just met But believe
me Mr Rawlins You can trust me

42 EASY
(shrugging)
There was no one else

Terans face sags with disappointment and then

TERAN
Well dont worry Mr Rawlins I

wont tolerate your being
harassed You or any of my
constituency -- I was a city
councilman in the Watts area for
two terms with a large contingent

of colored -- I value all of my
supporters equally humble though
they may be -- where can we drop

you Mr Rawlins

EASY
You can let me out here

TERAN
Are you sure Mr Rawlins This
must be quite out of your way

EASY
Its okay

The little boy stares up at Easy through big dark almond-
shaped eyes in the silence that follows And then Teran

picks up the ivory horn that hangs next to his head

TERAN
Norman pull the car over

EXT WAREHOUSE AREA - NIGHT

The limousine stops and Easy pushes the door open and gets
out

TERAN
Mr Rawlins may I offer you cab
fare

Terans stubby fingers hold out crumpled bills

EASY
No thanks

Easy closes the door and watches the long Cadillac glide
away

EASY (VO)
There had been nights during the

44
war that I still had trouble
claiming as part of my life
Insane nights I wasnt sure ever
really happened And here I was
again Had I really just gotten
out of a rich mans car who was
runnin for mayor Running
against the man I was supposed to

running And I was feeling sick
Sick from wondering if I had really
hard that Coretta was dead

INT EASYS HOUSE - BEDROOM

The room is a mess trousers strewn here shirt and shoes
over there And from the corners are haunting ghostly
whispers

CORETTAS VOICE
You be sorry if you go
(heavy breathing)
I cant give up that much love

A PINT OF BOURBON 34 full sits atop the cherry wood
nightstand Another empty bottle lies next to it on its
side in front of a water glass with 12 inch of liquor at
the bottom

EASYS HEAD rests on a pillow on the bed behind it
sweating tossing and turning as the ghost gets louder

CORETTAS VOICE
Oh yeah daddy You hittin my

The voice of the ghost is reaching closer for his ear

CORETTAS VOICE
Oh thats just too good Easy Oh

The voice is right up in his face

notices and takes a drink -- more medicine than pleasure

Easys Pontiac snakes up the winding road city lights
glimmering in flashes below as it rounds the curves

INT EASYS CAR - NIGHT

Ben Websters Ive Got It Bad plays on the road as Easy
shifts nervously in his seat his eyes searching in the
rearview mirror and all around for headlights that might be
unfriendly Daphne leans back against the passenger door
taking him in

Easy passes a police car pulled over to the side

He looks in the rearview mirror and its headlights go on
He takes a deep breath bracing for the worst and Daphne

looks back concerned
But the lights arch a U-turn and head back the other way

DAPHNE
They must not have seen us that
well God Frank and I have been

She catches herself and looks over at Easy

DAPHNE
(continuing)

EXT RICHARDS CABIN - NIGHT

Daphne waits clutching her suitcase and lets Easy lead the

way

They get to the door and find it ajar
inside and then cautiously steps in

Easy takes a look

INT RICHARDS CABIN - NIGHT

He flicks on the wall switch Its a typical little
hideaway that the rich kept for summer use The living
room dining room and kitchen are all in one with a long
counter separating the kitchen

On the left is a wooden couch with a Mexican rug thrown
across it and a metal chair with tan cushions for the seat
and back The opposite wall is all glass with the city
lights blinking in the distance

DAPHNE
Mr McGee

No answer Easy leads them to a door and opens it

BEDROOM

Another wall of glass and

A DEAD MAN spread out on the king-sized bed with the
contents of the dresser and closet strewn all over the room

DAPHNE
Oh my God

She gags and backs out of the room with her hand over her
mouth in case she throws up

Easy takes out a handkerchief and holds it over his mouth
and nose as he gets a closer look at the body

Its the drunk white man he had seen at Johns Speakeasy in
the same blue suit Hes lying on his back like a crucifix
with a butcher knife buried in his chest Theres blood

that has drained from his chest and gathered around his face
and hair so dark and thick you could scoop it up like Jello

Easy actually does throw up and doubles over dropping to a
knee to keep his balance and some control He stays there
for several moments regaining his composure and then spots a
spilled ashtray and a cigarette butt He lifts it off the
floor and smells it He wipes his mouth with the
handkerchief and then wraps the butt inside and puts it in
his pocket He gets up

He hears a CAR ENGINE start up and GEARS SHIFTING Then
runs out the door

A pink Studebaker whips backward out the driveway Easy
runs alongside trying to stop Daphne as she screeches into
the street
EASY
Hey wait a minute
She speeds off down the canyon
EASY
Dammit
He stands in the middle of the street watching her go
INT EASYS CAR - SUNRISE
Fiery orange light bounces off the hood of the car into
Easys face as he turns the corner onto his block He is
surprised to see
A WHITE CADILLAC parked in front of his house And now its

his front door thats open
BACK TO EASY
He pulls in behind the Caddy and gets out

INT EASYS HOUSE

He pushes open the door Shariff loiters just inside
grinning at him and Manny stands in the middle of the
living room looking at the floor From a RADIO in another
room Tommy Dorsey plays Blue Skies with Frank Sinatra out
front And so Easy walks past the two hoods into

THE KITCHEN

Albright turns from looking out the backyard window with a
porcelain coffee cup cradled in his right hand
ALBRIGHT
Easy

Easy looks at the coffee pot on the stove and again at
Albright smiling loose and friendly but looking tired in
the same clothes he had on at the pier

EASY

ALBRIGHT

used a screwdriver on the door
What happened to your face

60

EASY
You got no excuse to be breakin
into my house -- What if I broke

ALBRIGHT

Easy boils inside and then goes over to the counter to pour
himself a cup of coffee

EASY
So what do you want

ALBRIGHT
Where have you been this time of
morning Easy

EASY

The smile leaves Albrights face and his eyes turn even
colder

ALBRIGHT
I didnt come here to play boy
You got my money in your pocket and
weve been over at that address

waitin all night for Frank Green
and now weve found out that he
moved from there over a year ago

Easy is scared and confused but he plays it off

EASY
So what do you want me to do about
it You dont think I did my job
Shit I give you the money back

And he reaches for his pocket but Albright reaches too --
and suddenly Manny and Shariff are in the room and on Eas
like a vice Albright presses the barrel of the 45 agains
Easys forehead

ALBRIGHT
Do you believe in God Easy
Cause Im curious to see if death
is any different for a religious
man

Easy looks down away from the gun and swallows hard

EASY
I seen her

After a moment everyone relaxes and Easy sags out from
under their grip and staggers into

THE LIVING ROOM

Manny and Shariff surround him as he sits down in a chair
and Albright stalks in holstering his gun

ALBRIGHT

Albright looks around the room as if answers lie in the
corners but he is not surprised to hear about a body

speed limit Thats all I did

To his shame Easy flinches and gets paper from his end
table then scribbles down the address and hands it to
Albright who takes Easys seat and examines the note

ALBRIGHT
Get me some whiskey Easy

Easy studies Albright who sits knees wide apart now the
master of the house and he cant help himself

EASY
Get it yourself Bottles in the
cabinet

Albright looks up and Easy braces himself for Albright to
bring on the end all at once But slowly a smile spreads
across Albrights face and he laughs stamping his foot 61
ALBRIGHT
Well Ill be damned Get us a
drink Manny Easy youre a
brave man I need a brave man

EASY

Manny brings Albrights drink and the captain turns it up
and gives Manny back the glass

ALBRIGHT
(continuing)
Now you got three days to find him
And you make sure you count em
right

He walks out the screen door with Manny and Shariff
following

KITCHEN 62

Easy grabs the bottle from the counter where Manny has left

it and pours himself a stiff one But he only stares into

the glass

FLASHBACK

EXT BATTLEFIELD - DAY 63

Dense black smoke masks everything but two vague figures in
a struggle The BOOM of heavy artillery gives way only to
the deafening CHATTER of automatic fire

We are hurtling forward into a horror-stricken Easy in
combat gear repeatedly stabbing an already lifeless German
soldier Tears are streaming down Easys face his mouth
gaped open in an inaudible SCREAM
BACK TO SCENE 64
He studies the glass and pushes it away Then looks

OUT THE WINDOW
Albright and his two goons get in the white Caddy and cruise

away

flinch at hearing that Coretta was
dead and he seemed to know all
about Richard McGee too

OPERATOR (0S)

He pauses speechless as

OPERATOR (0S)
Yes

EASY
(after a moment)

He hangs up his eyes trained in thought

A67 EXT JOPPYS BAR - DAY
A67

A crowd has gathered along the street to watch a three
convertible car caravan the first car bearing a four-place
band playing Happy Days Are Here Again the second with
someone who could be Lana Turner holding up a Teran for
Mayor placard with a man in the front passenger seat
announcing through a megaphone and last but hardly least
Matthew Teran blowing kisses and waving two small American
flags

Easy looks up for a moment as he closes the trunk of his car
to watch the parade Then stuffs a ball peen hammer in the

waistband at the small of his back under his jacket

He walks with a purpose into the open door next to the
butcher shop

B67 INT JOPPYS BAR

Easy stops in the doorway seeing

JOPPY as usual buffing the marble top of his bar T-Bone
Walkers They Call It Stormy Monday is on the jukebox

walks in

JOPPY

JOPPY

EASY
The one your friend is lookin for

JOPPY

aggressive stance

And he pulls a baseball bat from behind the bar but Easy
has pulled his hammer and SMACKS it down hard cracking the
beveled wood that frames the marble

JOPPY
(continuing panicked)
Easy wait Watch my marble My
uncle left me that when he died

EASY
And goddammit hes about to get it

He draws back for the downswing and Joppy drops the
baseball bat holding up his hands

JOPPY
Lets talk Lets just talk

EASY
What you got me into Joppy

Joppy inhales forcing himself to be calm

JOPPY
She asked me to help her cause I

for a cigarette with one hand and shakes his head with
disgust as he lights up

EASY
Damn Joppy Is there any white
woman that ever gave you the time
of day that you wasnt a sucker
for

Joppy frowns painfully and continues to wipe the bar

EXT T CARTER FOUNDATION - DAY

Easy turns into the winding driveway through the stone
entrance way that bears the name of this distinguished
institution on a bronze plate

He parks the car and gets out adjusting his dark brown
Stetson which matches his pin-stripped suit He looks
around at the massive and well manicured grounds and walks
into a patio area of this Spanish-style complex

EASY (VO)
Albright had said that when youre
mixed up in something its best to
be mixed up to the top I could
see his point So thats where I

was going all the way to the
top

EXT CARTER FOUNDATION PATIO 68

An ELDERLY SECRETARY descends an outdoor curved stairway
carrying a file She spots Easy looking around confused and
immediately becomes annoyed

BAXTER
Not very smart talking about Mr
Carters business to a secretary

EASY
I dont wanna hear it man Its

damn about what you think is smart

Baxter bristles up and slows down his walk about to put
Easy in his place But Easy slows down too and squares up
on him Baxter reconsiders and leads the way up a stone
staircase

INT CARTERS OFFICE 70

Baxter ushers Easy into a huge elegantly furnished room more
closely resembling a hall than an office with large arched
doors and windows leading out onto a stone veranda
overlooking a canyon

Alone looking out at the greenery on the opposite hillside
is TODD CARTER

Baxter walks out and speaks with Carter while Easy watches
them from inside the office The rich man perks up with
interest and hurries inside with Baxter who throws Easy a
dirty look on his way out He pauses uncertainly wearing a
simple Sears Roebuck-looking tan suit with a plain open-
collared white shirt The dark circles under his eyes show
nights without sleep

70

CARTER
Mr Rawlins

He runs a hand through his thinning red hair and offers an
overstuffed sofa They sit on either end

to keep from going to pieces This guys got it bad

EASY

Carter runs his hand through his hair again the suspense

killing him

Carter leans

proceed

EASY
You didnt hire somebody to find

that she was hundreds of miles away

Easy nods his brow furrowed in thought Carter gets up and
walks to the door looking out into the canyon

CARTER
(half to himself)
Someone is looking for her

EASY

Carter shrugs and stammers nervously

CARTER
Uh I dont know We were going

He stops and looks to the floor the gravity pulling him

down way down
CARTER
(continuing)

CARTER

CARTER

--No They cant

Carter is too emphatic and Easy waits for him to give more
but instead he turns and gazes out again at the canyon

BAXTER

money shoves the wallet at Easy

CARTER

Easy nods and strides out of the room

71 OMIT

A72 EXT T CARTER FOUNDATION - DAY
A72

Easy walks to his car gets in and drives away toward the
entrance

EASY (VO)
So Albright was working for Matthew
Teran And whatever Teran had on
Carter was strong stuff too
strong even for Carter to go to the
police But because Teran was
desperate to find the girl too
that gave me the best hand I had
seen her once and if I played it
right Id see her again

the place Through the smoke other distrustful eyes fix on

Easy unlatches the gate and pushes it open Hes tired and
he trudges up the walkway to the porch He sees

THE WOODCUTTER standing on the front lawn of the next door
neighbors waving at him

BACK TO EASY

He throws a rock and then unlocks the door But he notices
THE POT OF AFRICAN VIOLETS lying broken on the cement He
looks up just in time to see a TWO-BY-FOUR swing down
BONK And Easy is seeing stars

A big man dressed in black kicks open the door and drives
Easy head first into

INT EASYS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Easy slams to the floor but manages to roll out of the way
of a lethal CRACK of the board onto the floor

He grabs a lamp and hurls it at the oncoming figure who
catches it on the arm and keeps on coming snapping a blade
from his fist which leaps out like a chrome-colored flame

Easy scrambles back his head butting up against the couch
his forehead streaming blood his eyes wide with the sight
of sure death advancing

EASY
(terrified)
Frank Wait a minute I need to
talk to you
Frank looms over him his sinister but handsome brown face
framed by a short-rimmed black Stetson hat and a black
shirt and coat He holds the knife to Easys neck letting the

blade press into the skin as he talks

FRANK
You the reason why she told me to
lay low hunh

Easy buries himself back against the sofa

EASY
(machine gun quick)
Naw I got five hundred dollars
for you Rich man wants to talk to
a white girl you know Daphne

Franks eyes flame and he presses the knife drawing blood

FRANK
You a dead man--

WHAP WHAP WHAP

OS VOICE
Easy you in there

Franks head whips toward the door and Easy knocks the knife
away and comes up tussling

Frank scrambles to get away and Easy tackles him straining
to keep Frank from reaching the knife

THE FRONT DOOR springs open and SPATS ON PATENT LEATHER
SHOES clump in the last one stomping down on Franks
outstretched fingers Frank screams and cradles his hand in
agony

Easy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at

MOUSE dressed in a plaid zoot suit with Broadway suspenders
down the front of his shirt a long-barreled 41 caliber
pistol held loosely in his hand

MOUSE
Want me to kill him

EASY
(exhaling relief)
Mouse Aw man naw its all

MOUSE

He holds out his hand and helps Easy to his feet
Frank makes a slight move towards the knife and Mouse levels

the pistol at his head his gold-rimmed teeth glittering
from a smile that wants Frank to go for it

MOUSE

EASY
No dont
(to Frank)

Wheres Daphne Monet
Frank just stares up at Easy his eyes sharp and defiant

EASY
Look if you dont know where she

The phone RINGS next to Mouse and he picks it up eyes still
on Frank

Easy grabs Mouses arm and Frank slumps to the floor

EASY
Let him go

MOUSE

EASY
Let him be

The two friends struggle and Frank rears up and plows into
Easy sending him sprawling to the floor on top of Mouse
Then Frank covered in blood hurls himself across the room
out the door

81 Mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the 81
pistol but its too late Easy stands up and Mouse points the
gun at him

MOUSE
Damn you Easy Dont you never
grab me when I got a gun in my
hand

Easy silently eyes the pistol and gives Mouse a chance to
calm down After a moment Mouse looks down at his jacket

MOUSE
Look at the blood you done got on
my coat Why you wanna go and do
that

He looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase Then
spots the bathroom and moves to it taking off his jacket
and hanging the pistol in his belt

Easy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and
catches his breath as Mouse runs water in the bathtub

MOUSE
Now we got to find that girl so we
can get that money

EASY
No we dont Mouse I dont need
your kinda help or I wouldve
called you

Mouse comes out of the bathroom scrubbing at a spot on his
jacket with a washcloth

MOUSE
You standing there with a knot on
your head the size of a twelve-
year-old tittie and you dont need
my kind of help

EASY
(angrily)
This is the same shit you pulled
five years ago when you asked me to
drive you out to your stepfathers
house then come to find out you
killed him and your stepbrother

MOUSE
Aw easy that was a long time ago

Easy glares at Mouse and dabs blood from his forehead with a
handkerchief

81

MOUSE
(after a moment)
Come on Easy Cut me in on this

He ambles over to Easy apologetically and holds Easys
shoulders with both hands

MOUSE
I swear I aint gonna do nothin

Easy knows he cant believe this but

EASY
Everything I say

MOUSE

With no choice Easy nods and walks into
THE BATHROOM 82

He runs cold water onto a washcloth and looks in the mirror
dabbing at his forehead

EASY

Easy turns toward the door Aw Man

On the other side of the room Mason picks up a chunk of the
broken lamp from the fight

Laurel Canyon

Mason comes over and stands over Easy next to his partner
He fingers the sharp porcelain shard of the lamp
threatening

MASON
He hangs out with some of those
same nigger friends of yours down
on Central Avenue

Easy eyes the sharp edge making up his mind to kill this
fat son-of-a-bitch if he gets too creative and die with
him

MILLER
He just happened to have a note in
his pocket with C James written
on it

He holds the slip of paper up for Easy to see

porches and doorways staggered in a semi-circle around a
small yard that has a half-dozen stunted magnolia trees
growing in brick pots

Easy and Mouse step into the courtyard passing elderly
tenants sitting inside screened doors Jimmy Luncefords
Im Walking Through Heaven With You floats out into the
yard

They arrive at the closed door of number eight Easy knocks
and then knocks again hard Something CRASHES on the
inside and heavy FOOTSTEPS pound to the door

INT JUNIORS APARTMENT - DAY

Filthy and junky with old car parts scattered amongst old
furniture the room is unpleasant with only the benefit of a
dim light -- just like Junior

JUNIOR

He nods at a card table with one folding chair and throws
two others into place on his way to the refrigerator

Easy and Mouse sit down and Junior brings over a quart of
PABST BLUE RIBBON BEER and two glasses that he wipes out
with a rag

EASY

Junior tosses his pack onto the table and pours beer into
the glasses for Easy and Mouse and drinks from the bottle

uncovering the cigarette butt from Richard McGees house

INT EASYS CAR - DUSK

Compton looks a lot like Texas with unpaved streets and
little country-styled houses set back away from the road
behind vegetable gardens and chicken coops and small sheds
with a horse or a cow tied up

Easy and Mouse pull into the gravel driveway of a little
house and are met by the usual barking dog you find in the
country -- part Spaniel part Shepherd and some kind of
Retriever It dogs Easy and Mouses heels as they get out

of the car

EXT DUPREES SISTERS HOUSE - DUSK

They notice the light in the front window go out and the
shade pull back slightly as they walk toward the front door
Moments later the door opens and the dark figure of Dupree
Brouchard appears

DUPREE
(to the dog)

Go on Go on in the back

The dog obeys and Easy and Mouse walk up the walkway

EASY
Hey Dupree Been trying to call

DUPREE

Raymond

MOUSE

DUPREE

INT DUPREES SISTERS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
Duprees face under the kitchen light shows two swollen

black eyes from a brutal police questioning His eyes are
heavy with liquor and tears glisten down his cheeks

DUPREE
Why somebody wanna kill her like
that Why

EASY
I dont know Dupree I dont
know

Dupree pours rye whiskey into a water glass in front of
Mouse who swallows half the shot without looking up from
his plate of food

Easy declines when the bottle comes his way feeling the
pressure of time running out

EASY
Did Coretta ever say anything to
you about a letter she was keeping

DUPREE
Letter What kinda letter

EASY
For that white girl

DUPREE
Naw But I know it was on account
of her that Coretta got killed

Easy rears back in his chair with keen interest and Mouse
looks up from his pigtails

Dupree takes a drink and his eyes narrow in anger

DUPREE
(continuing)

He buries his face into his hands and Easy throws a sad but

Everything between Coretta and that
Daphne was always such a damn
secret I mean that ole girl
didnt think nothin about two-
timin on Frank She probably
innerduced Coretta to one of them

(MORE ) DUPREE (CONTD)
Junior had been by and just left
the house and she came runnin
out to the car carrying her

Easy and Mouse exchange looks JACKPOT And Dupree falls
apart

DUPREE
(continuing)
Aw Gawd I cant even go to

DUPREE
(continuing)
Police wont even let me go near
her house So its the only thing
I got left from her It was a
sign I know it was a sign
cause she was so religious

MOUSE
Its all right big man its all
right

And he pours Dupree a half glass of rye

THE BOTTLE - LATER NIGHT

Barely a corner of whiskey lies at the bottom and
DUPREE is snoring like a buzzsaw sound asleep

MOUSE squints into his glass wondering why its empty and
looks down the length of the kitchen leading into

THE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Drawers are pulled out on the dresser and Easy is rifling
through another until he pulls out a bible He fans the
pages finding

THE LETTER

already opened His fingers pull out a photograph and then
two more

BACK TO EASY
His excited face goes sick and he silently mouths

EASY
Holy shi-it

EASY (VO)

I was as nauseated from fear as I

was from what I saw Pictures of

a much younger Matthew Teran and

children innocent helpless

naked children
KITCHEN

Easy hurries in holding up the letter

EASY
I got it Come on I think that

Easy grabs his coat off a chair and starts to put it on
stuffing the letter in his coat pocket

EASY
You got your sails up pretty far

MOUSE

EASY
Well you been puttin it away

MOUSE

barreled pistol and is aiming it at Easys forehead

MOUSE
Aint a man in Texas can outdraw

And he puts the gun back in his shoulder holster

101

MOUSE
Go for your gun Lets see who

EASY
I dont have a gun Raymond Come

on lets go

MOUSE

You fool enough to go without a
piece then you must wanna be dead

He lays the pistol on the table then draws a 32 automatic
from his waist this time cocking the hammer the muzzle
only inches from Easys head

Easy can tell from the glazed look in Mouses eye that
instead of seeing him his friend is glaring at some demon
he carries around in his head So he stands stock still

EASY
(quiet soothing)
Let him go Raymond He done

learned his lesson If you kill
him then he wont have got it

MOUSE

He fool enough to call me out and
he aint even got no gun Ill
ill the motherfucker

EASY

Let him live Raymond and he be
scared whenever you walk in the
room

MOUSE
Motherfucker better be scared I
kill a motherfucker I kill him

Easy stares down the barrel of the gun for a long moment
until Mouse blinks then nods and lets the pistol fall down

into his lap His head on his chest hes sound asleep

Easy takes the gun and puts it on the table with the other
Then walks to the doorway and turns out the light

INT EASYS CAR - NIGHT

The dim street lamps of Easys neighborhood streak past as
Easy scans the streets and sidewalks wary for anybody who
might be staking him out

EASY (VO)
The pictures were burnin a hole in
my pocket I had no doubt that
Albright had killed McGee and
that he had done it for Matthew
Teran But Teran hadnt known who
killed Coretta I was sure of

that too

103 EXT EASYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Easys car pulls up and he gets out and looks around
cautiously before starting up the walkway

EASY (VO)

howing up in a few hours asking

ZatHweunwars

Easy gets to the door still literally looking over his
shoulder and hears the phone RINGING inside He unlocks
the door and bursts in

104 INT EASYS HOUSE

He races through the dark living room and into

105 INT BEDROOM

And picks up the phone but the dial tone DRONES on the other
end

EASY
Shit Damn

He whacks the nightstand with the receiver dying with
frustration And SOMETHING MOVES in the dark He lunges
and grabs

DAPHNE MONET

and pulls her into the light then sits down onto the bed
before the shock can knock him down

DAPHNE
Are you all right

Easy shakes his head in disbelieving relief and she reaches
to touch the bump on his forehead

DAPHNE

He pulls away

Joppy points a finger in Corettas face backing her against
the counter She grabs a knife from a rack of dishes left
out to dry

DAPHNE (VO)
Joppy said she pulled a knife and
tried to dump hot water on him
She swipes at Joppy and he backhands her against the
stove She struggles to grab a pot of boiling water but
he wrests it from her and slings her across the room against
the counter her head striking the tile on the way down

The sound of the front door pushing open startles them and
Albright knocks on his way in

ALBRIGHT
Well Ill be damned You found

And Manny and Shariff step in too carrying baseball bats

EASY
Wait a minute Albright

Daphne breaks for the back way and Easy tries to bar Shariff
from going after her

EASY
Hey

Manny swings the baseball bat into Easys side and Easy
yells and plows into him wrestling him against the wall

Albright grabs Easy from behind and pries him free enough
for Manny to uppercut him to the chin with the fat end of
the bat

Easy sinks to his knees seeing double

Shariff leads Daphne back into the room her face contorted
into tears her arm twisted up behind her in a hammerlock ALBRIGHT

(to Daphne)
Where are the pictures

DAPHNE
(terrified)

Easy grabs for the wall to get to his feet and Manny swings
the bat down into his kidney

ALBRIGHT

Shariff leads Daphne outside and Manny draws his forty-five
automatic and trains it on Easy cocking the hammer

ALBRIGHT
Whatre you doin Who are we

He shoves Manny through the door and pushes Easy onto his
side with his foot and hes out the door

Easy strains to get back to his knees as car doors slam and
the sound of a car engine growls to life

He thrusts himself up from the floor and stumbles toward the
front door like a boxer who should have stayed down for the

count He gets it open in time to see

EXT EASYS HOUSE - NIGHT

The blurred white form of Albrights Caddy screaming away
shattering the dark shrieking in flight

Dogs are barking and a baby is screaming somewhere in the
neighborhood while lights are going on up and down the

out of the room

INT EASYS CAR - NIGHT

Easy is ripping through the night

the streetlights flashing

by in blurs of light The windows down hes coming to

taking Daphne someplace more
isolated than that office building
downtown Someplace where there
would be no witnesses And I was
being left alive to take the fall

EXT BUTCHER SHOPJOPPYS BAR - NIGHT

The street is still alive A couple of late night juke

joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party
onto the sidewalk to straggle home Easys car screams
around the corner and then skids in sending a heavy-hipped
young sister about to cross the street scrambling for
cover

He jumps out just as Mouse scorches the tires on Duprees
38 Packard in behind him

EASY
(to the woman)
Sorry baby Lemme give you
twenty bucks for them stockings you

It takes a moment to register but when she sees him pull
a twenty from his pocket she gets busy

He runs back to Mouse

EASY
Gimme one of them guns you got

Mouse smiles loving this side of Easy and trades him a set
of car keys for a 32 automatic

EASY
(continuing)
Start up my car Im comin out

He runs back to the woman he almost hit and hands off the
twenty grabbing one of the nylons leaving her still
stripping as he runs into

INT STAIRWAY

He takes the steps two at a time pulling the stocking down
over his face as he reaches the top and bursts through the
open door leading into

INT JOPPYS BAR

He charges through the raucous laughter of the half-full
room right up to the bar
Joppy nearly drops the glasses he is clearing away as he
looks down the barrel of the pistol aimed at his face

EASY
Come on Joppy Lets go

Joppy hesitates recognizing the voice
EASY
You heard me Ill blow your head

123 EXT ALBRIGHTS CABIN - NIGHT

The cabin draws nearer as Easy scrambles up the hill He
can hear Daphne crying out something but he cant make out
the words

It quiets down as he nears and sees shadows crossing a
window with the shade pulled down

He moves cautiously quietly to the window and peers through
the crack between the shade and the windowsill He can make
out a sliver of what looks like a large room with a low
ceiling SMACK And Daphne screams again

ALBRIGHTS VOICE
Come on talk to me Talk to me
while you still can

DAPHNES VOICE

(sobbing)
Please I dont have them Easy

strains to see more

ALBRIGHTS VOICE
You said he didnt know anything

DAPHNES VOICE
I was lying

ALBRIGHTS VOICE
Okay Grab that for me Shariff
Its ready

And then SCRE-E-EAM The kind that drops the bottom out of
your stomach The kind more akin to fear than the word
itself The kind that fries your skin with the cold chill

of horror S-C-R-E-EAMS again

DAPHNES VOICE
No-o-o-o Please No-o-o

ALBRIGHTS VOICE
Now talk to me goddammit

DAPHNES VOICE
No-o-o

Easys gotta make a move KABLANGALANGLE He smashes the
window with the gun and the shade rattles all the way up

Manny looks right up at his face as Daphne arches and
flails trying to get free from his hands that are pinning
her down on a battered old sofa

Albright is holding a glowing red poker that Shariff
standing in front of the fireplace has just handed him

Easy starts blasting KABLAAM Manny takes one to the
throat KABLAAM

Albright and Shariff lunge for cover and Daphne ducks down
behind the back of the sofa screaming and screaming

Manny hand to his throat pulls his gun on reflex firing
into the floor and then half runs half staggers out the
side door just ahead of another KABLAAM that digs out a
chunk of the wall

Easy hears the screen door open and then ducks down getting
ready for Manny who should be coming his way from the side
door He HEARS more steps stumble out and then SILENCE

And then KABLAAM BLAAM Two huge blasts rip right
through the wall next to Easys head and he scrambles to
the side of the house underneath another window with the
shade pulled down

ALBRIGHT (0S)
(to Shariff)
Who the hells out there

SHARIFF

(getting frantic)

ALBRIGHT (0S)

Easy HEARS footsteps coming alongside the house where he had
been moments ago KABLAAM BLAAM Albright has fired from
the inside again thinking its him

EASY
(whispering)
Mouse

But its Manny clutching his throat gurgling for air
stumbling aimlessly off down the hill A walking dead

man EASY hears him tumble into some shrubbery and after a
moment the gurgling stops

ALBRIGHT (0S)
Easy Hey Buddy
(then to Shariff)
Come on goddammit

Daphne cries out and KLABLANGLE Easy breaks the window
with the gun but KABLAAM BLAAM BLAAM The windowsill
tears out above his head and Daphne screams again

Easy looks up to see Shariff holding her in front of him as
a shield Hes headed straight for Easy drawing a bead on
him for the kill And then KABLAAM the back of Shariffs
skull flies off and

MOUSE is in the side door blasting BLAAM

Albright breaks for the window BLAAM The slug spins him
halfway around but he hurls himself through the window
backwards

Easy scurries to the front of the house and BLAAM The
bullet goes wide and Albright manages to get into his car

and returns fire BLAAM BLAAM Easy hits the deck

Albrights engine roars to life and he SQUEALS out on the

gravel Mouse appears on the other side of the house and
CLICK CLICK hes out of ammo He pulls out the other
pistol but its too late

MOUSE
Damn damn damn I hit him I
hit him

Easy gets up from the ground and trudges into the front
door

INT ALBRIGHTS CABIN

Easy finds Daphne standing in the middle of the room her
whole body quaking in shock He takes off his jacket and
drapes it around her

EASY
Come on You all right

Her top lip is swollen and bloody and she has a dark bruise
on her cheek She jerks her head nodding yes

As he leads her through the doorway he stops to look back
at Shariffs legs sprawling out on the floor from behind the
sofa

EXT ALBRIGHTS CABIN - NIGHT

He leads her down the front porch and hears

MOUSE
Theres blood all over here I
got him

Mouse gets up from squatting down grinning the gold rims
of his teeth catching a glint from the light coming through

the door He looks Daphne over admiring

MOUSE
Damn Sweetheart

Easy leads her past quickly

MOUSE
She okay

EASY
Yeah Lets go

127 EXT ROUTE 9 - NIGHT

Mouse opens the back seat door of the car and Easy sees that
theres no one there

EASY
Wheres Joppy

And then he looks around quickly seeing
JOPPYS BODY lying off on the side of the road

EASY
What happened

Mouse shrugs

MOUSE
I didnt have time to be tying him
up

Daphne sees the body too and starts gagging Easys face
twists into helpless pain and he holds a handkerchief to
Daphnes mouth

EASY
Why man Why

127

MOUSE
Why what You just said dont
shoot him And I didnt I

choked his ass
Easy helps Daphne into the car and closes the door

EASY
Damn Mouse Why

MOUSE
How Im gonna help you back there
foolin round with him
A128
A128

EASY
He was tied up Why

MOUSE
Aw man If you didnt want him
kilt you shouldnt have left him
with me

And he goes around to the passenger side of the car to get
in

Unlike up at the house this was murder -- the same as it had
been in Texas with Mouses stepfather and brother Tears of
rage well up in Easys eyes as he hears the car door close

DISSOLVE TO

EXT GLENDALE TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

Daphne sits in the car her eyes staring straight ahead
still in shock

EXT PLATFORM - NIGHT

A few people hurry to board the train Easy and Mouse among
them

EASY (VO)
I convinced Mouse to take the two
oclock train to Pomona and to let
me handle everything else He
could get a train back to Houston
later that morning He was fine
with that but only because he was
seven thousand dollars richer
Daphne had gotten the money out of
a locker at the YMCA without a
word

(MORE)

EASY (VO) (CONTD)
Because she was still in shock and

couldnt really talk Maybe too
because she had stolen about four
times that much from Carter

MOUSE
Listen if you think you gonna have
trouble with that dude Frank I can
run by and kill him and take that
evening train to Houston

EASY
Naw man

He has had enough of Mouse for a while

MOUSE
Oh This is for you

And he pulls out something wrapped up in a brown paper bag
from his coat

MOUSE
I cut you in for half cause I knew
you was too big a fool to take your
share from that white girl
yourself

Easy stares numbly at the package and then takes it

The conductor gets on board and the train starts making
those metal on metal sounds

MOUSE
Send my grip to Etta Mae Im
gonna see if shell take me back
now that Im flush

He slaps Easy on the shoulder and boards the train

MOUSE
Oh heres the keys to Duprees
car

He tosses them and the train starts moving

MOUSE
And if you need somebody to run
them streets with ya gimme a call
You know how to put some money in a
niggas pocket

And he laughs flashing gold teeth pulling away Easy watches

EASY (VO)
I knew I would see him again and I
didnt know how I felt about
that cause unlike Mouse my
legs were like rubber the way
they had been in the war the whole
two years I was there

EXT GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY - NIGHT

Easy sits in his car smoking a cigarette rubbing his aching
chin looking out at

DAPHNE AND CARTER

standing on the lawn in front of the planetarium Carter
wanders after Daphne explaining while she paces back and
forth in anger

EASY
I could tell how it was gonna go
when Carter asked us to meet him at
the Observatory instead of at his
house She knew it too But she
had come this far and she had to
play it out

Suddenly Daphne stops abruptly and strides hurriedly back
toward the car Carter follows behind

CARTER
Daphne Daphne sweetheart

He starts over too but then stops knowing heres no use

INT CAR - NIGHT

She gets in

DAPHNE
Come on Easy Lets go

Easy throws a look over at Carter
DAPHNE
(continuing)
Dont worry you can give him the
pictures yourself

And she throws them down on the seat

131 OMIT

132 Easy fires up the engine and pulls away with Daphne

looking straight ahead

EASY
Hey Im sorry

The slight twist of her head amounts to a shrug and then the
tears flow The sun is coming up over the city below

EASY (VO)
For the first time I felt that I
could fall in love with her too
I was even wondering if it was
starting to happen when I dropped
her off at 63rd and Dinker where
her brother Frank was waiting
Then it occurred to me that she
still had Carters money and I
felt like a fool

133 INT CITY HALL

Easy walks onto the rotunda holding a hand to his aching
kidney A secretary comes out to meet him and as she

leaves Todd Carter and a group of men in business suits
converge on him shaking hands

EASY (VO)
Evidently Carter had told all his
cronies about the pictures because
they were all smiles and handshakes
and how do ya do The Mayor
the police chief The newspaper
land developers All the men who
ran the City and who really stood
to gain by who was the Mayor for
the next six years

The group fans out leaving Carter and Easy alone to walk off
down a hallway

OMIT

OMIT

INT MAYORS OFFICE

Spacious and heavy in leather and wood with a not-so-
spectacular view of the mountains Its cold and official
like the job itself

Carter pulls a brown envelope from inside his coat pocket
not unlike Albright

CARTER
Heres the remaining eight hundred
that I owe you in cash And
another thousand which I hope will
keep this whole thing you know

Easy nods a tentative sure

CARTER
(continuing)
And Ive taken care of your
problems with the police Youll
have no more trouble there And
thats a promise

Easy nods and starts to go but

CARTER
(continuing to Easy)
Mr Rawlins did Daphne ever
say she loved me

Easy shrugs not knowing how to answer

EASY
Would it really matter if she did
Mr Carter
Carter nods sadly and Easy walks away leaving him a lonely
figure amidst all his power

137 EXT CITY HALL - DAY

Easy holds his kidney and lowers himself gingerly down the
granite steps

EASY (VO)
Id been thinking about Daphne
too wondering if she meant what
she said about what could have
happened between us But at the
moment I was wondering if there was
any such thing as a sprained chin
But other than that and a headache
a loose tooth and a kidney that a
doctor would need to look at I
felt like five thousand three
hundred dollars And unless
Albright was alive somewhere that
feelin was gonna last a while

OS VOICE
Hey Ezekiel

137

Miller and Mason are waiting outside their car at the curb
They come over

MILLER
You got some mighty powerful
friends up there mighty
powerful But see we gota
problem

Easy listens disinterestedly

MILLER
(continuing)
With the Chief sealing these things
up like this it doesnt do much
for the morale of the men whove
been working on these cases

MASON
Yeah Makes em feel like shit
MILLER
Theres a guy whos been callin on
the phone And were pretty sure
that he was up there with McGee

MASON
A uh colored guy sounds
kinda dumb
MILLER
(correcting)
Not very bright But he said you

accused him of the murder And he
swears you were up there too

MASON
In fact hes out and out pointing
the finger at ya

MILLER
How about a name

MASON
Hed do it to you

Easy waits to make sure theyre finished and

EASY
Sorry fellas But I gotta go

He starts away

137 EASY
(continuing)
Why dont you go back to the
station and uh wait around for
my call
MASON
You son-of-a-bitch You watch
yourself you hear Dont you even
spit on the fucking sidewalk I

better not even--

Masons voice fades under
EASY (VO)
It might be the last moment of my
adult life spent free was walking
away from City Hall

138 EXT EASYS HOUSE - DAY

A NEWSPAPER HEADLINE reads Carter Back In Race

The subheading reads Quiet Civic Leader Returns As
Flamboyant Teran Quits

EASY (VO)
The paper treated the mysterious
flip-flop like it happened every
day And I could tell that Matthew
Teran wouldnt spend a day in
jail Back in the second section
of the paper was a small article
about an unidentified man found
dead slumped over the steering
wheel of a white Cadillac just
north of Malibu

FURTHER BACK we see that Odell is reading the newspaper
nursing a can of ale

EASY (VO)
It scared me to think about a world
that could kill a man like DeWitt
Albright What could a world like
that do to me

ODELL
Hey Easy wheres your car

Easy looks up from pulling weeds

138 138

EASY
In the shop Im havin it fixed
up a little

ODELL
Yeah Man cant get no decent job
in this town without a car

EASY

ODELL

EASY
Im gonna go to work for myself
Take a little money I got saved up
and go into real estate Start
fixin up folks gardens again
and do a few favors on the side
Favors for friends

ODELL

EASY
Well like a woman offered me
thirty dollars to go track down her
husband for her

ODELL
You talkin about private
investigatin or somethin You

Easy keeps working

Easy gets up

EASY
Like a man once said to me Odell
Walk out your door in the morning
and youre already in trouble
Its just how youre mixed up in
that trouble that counts

and turns on the water hose

EASY
(continuing)
Odell
ODELL
Yeah Easy

EASY

If you got a friend that does bad

and you still keep him as your
friend even though you know what

hes like Do you think thats
right

ODELL
All you got is your friends
Easy

Easy starts to nod but then spots

THE WOODCUTTER

hovering over a rosebush in a neighbors yard across the
street his shears ready to cut

EASY
(calling out)
Get out of that yard
(to Odell)
Bastard cut down two of my trees

Easy picks up a rock and sails it Odell comes off the
porch and does the same Then a neighbor from across the
street joins in

THE WOODCUTTER ambles off toward another block leaving
Easy Odell and the neighbor gathered in the middle of the
street

UP THE BLOCK

aman with a pony is setting up a camera A few children
have gathered and more are running over from other parts of
the neighborhood

The man props up a hand-painted sign Cowboy Pictures -- 15
Cents and lifts the first customer onto the pony
positioning a cowboy hat on the childs head

BACK TO SCENE

Another neighbor joins Easy and company and they continue
to laugh and talk looking up from time to time to wave at
friends in passing cars

EASY (VO)
I thought about what Odell had said
about friends and it made sense to
me

(MORE)

EASY (VO) (CONTD)
Odell goes to church every Sunday
so he would know Later on he
challenged me to a game of
dominoes And whatd he do that
for We got to talkin bout Texas
and fooled around and drunk almost
a quart of whiskey And I forgot
about Daphne Monet DeWitt Albright
and Carter and them And sat with
my friend on my porch at my
house and we laughed a long
time

FADE OUT

THE END
