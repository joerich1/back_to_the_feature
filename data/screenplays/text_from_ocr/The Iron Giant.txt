Screen Story

BRAD BIRD

Inspired by the book by
TED HUGHES

FADE IN
DEEP SPACE

Stars blaze against the blackness of deep space One star
begins to move coming closer moving toward

EARTH in space blue seas fleecy white clouds BEEP-BEEP-—
BEEP a retro-satellite Sputnik tumbles past

Below near New England black storm clouds swirl in silence
Flashes LIGHTNING FLICKERS

A SHIP ON A STORM-TOSSED SEA - NIGHT

The wind HOWLS the storm RAGES in the chill waters off the
rocky coast of Maine Giant waves tower overhead then CRASH
over the decks of a fishing ship where desperate FISHERMEN
fight to stay alive The CAPTAIN YELLS orders no one can
hear in the deafening ROAR

INT SHIPS MAIN CABIN - NIGHT
The FIRST MATE yells into the radio their only hope
FIRST MATE
Mayday Mayday This is fishing ship

Annabelle Were floundering and taking
on water Mayday Mayday
An enormous WAVE smashes against the bow of the ship
throwing everyone in the cabin off balance A glass shatters

The Captain enters the two lock eyes it looks bad

CAPTAIN
Whats our position

SAILOR 1
(grim)
I dont know

CAPTAIN
If you dont know where we are then you
dont know where were going You could
be running us right into the rocks

Then a VOICE breaks through the static on the radio

RADIO
Coast Guard Portland Station to
Annabelle Do you read me

As the mate starts to answer lightning STRIKES the huge
mast It CRASHES through the pilothouse window SMASHING the
radio Glass radio parts FLY

The Captains shoulders slump now theyre done for

ON THE DECK - NIGHT

e Captain comes out on deck his men stare at him eyes
ull of fear desperation Then impossibly the WINDS

T
f£
TRAIL OFF In seconds the sea flattens into a sheet of
glass All is DEAD CALM Its eerie Ropes CREAK

The men ERUPT in celebration CHEERING hugging each other
its over The angry Captain YELLS

CAPTAIN
Its not over you idiots Its just the
eye of the storm

The men look around far off on the horizon the raging storm
still surrounds the ship but overhead stars appear Its
eerie strange

FISHERMAN
Look

Overhead a new brilliant star appears and its quickly
growing larger The blazing light speeds toward the startled
sailors impossibly fast intensely bright blinding all
goes white

KAWHOOSH The light CRASHES into the sea Water flies the
sea BOILS CHURNING ROARING the water green-lit from below
Great clouds of steam BILLOW and HISS

Then without warning the raging storm ROARS back with a
vengeance a huge wave SLAMS into the ship Again the
fishermen fight for their lives

But then a dim light appears far off in the rain a barely
visible beam sweeps back and forth in the storm

CAPTAIN
The lighthouse Head for it

The desperate men struggle to steer their limping ship toward
the light Then CLANG The ship shudders stops instantly
the ship has SLAMMED into a wall A solid wall a wall
made of iron

The sailors freeze speechless they look up the wall up
up flashes of lightning illuminate a face Twin beams of
light comes from what look to be eyes in an enormous
face A giant Made of metal

THUNDER BOOMS The impossible face seems to turn downward
and looks at the men The men quake

A HUGE WAVE CRASHES over the ship and throws the men
overboard into the sea The ship begins sinking fast

IN THE WATER NEAR THE CLIFFS - NIGHT

Men surface cling to ship debris Two men in a lifeboat
pull their comrades from the chill waters

A wave WASHES over rocks leaves behind a limp fisherman
clinging to the rocks Barely alive whipped by wind and

rain he sees lightning-brief glimpses of the giant thing as

it moves off in the HOWLING storm and dissapears

The VIEW MOVES up up the rocky cliff to the lighthouse

perched atop the cliff The brilliant beam tries in vain to
penetrate the RAGING storm

EXT HOGARTHS HOUSE - THAT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

We push through the storm towards an upstairs window and into

INT HOGARTHS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A flashlight beam illustrates the STORM SMASHING against a window

A WIDE-EYED NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY HOGARTH GRIPS THE FLASHLIGHT
AS THE STORM RAGES HOGARTH EXPLORES HIS ROOM BY FLASHLIGHT
THE MOVING BEAM GIVES LIFE TO THE ROOM FULL OF TOYS AND
MEMORABILIA THE WINDS HOWL GROWS LOUDER

GLASS SHATTERS and a cold wind whips into the room

VOICE (0OS)
Hogarth

The door flies open and Hogarths mother ANNIE is there
Late twenties attractive

ANNIE
Are you alright honey

HOGARTH
Yeah Mom Im okay

Annie turns to the shattered window pane then pushes
Hogarths bookshelf in front of it to block the wind Hogarth
stares at his monther She looks spooked

HOGARTH
1 are you

ANNIE
I hate when the power goes out But
yes Im fine

Outside the wind howls

HOGARTH
Wanna stay up with me for a while
(coaxing)
I could tell you a story

Annie smiles touched

ANNIE
A story huh What have you got for me
this time

HOGARTH
Well its a story about

Hogarth scans the toys and souvenirs on his bedside table
With a sudden flash of inspiration he grabs a baseball card

HOGARTH
Mickey Mantle He had a magic bat Mom
Everybody says so

As Annie watches Hogarth with motherly adoration Hogarth
picks up a plastic dinosaur

HOGARTH
Anyway this is the story of Mickeys
adventures with the stegosaurus Its
got action and romance And the best
part is its all true

Annie laughs and touches a fingertip on Hogarths forehead

ANNIE
Youve got a lot going on in there dont
you Hogarth
(wistfully)
Just like your father

For a moment Hogarth beams He looks over at a framed photo
that sits on his nightstand that shows a handsome man
dressed in an army uniform And as he stares at the photo a
sad pensive look comes over Hogarths face Annie sees it

HOGARTH
I cant wait til he comes back

ANNIE
(gently)
Weve been through this before honey

HOGARTH
They found his plane mom They didnt
find him Hes gonna come back

Annie sees the resolute look in her sons eyes and decides to
change tack

ANNIE
So what could he do with that magic bat
of his

HOGARTH

(lost in thought)
Huh

ANNIE
Mickey Mantle Could he cast spells with
it like a magician

HOGARTH
Oh
(brightening)
Yeah Yeah thats exactly what he could
do And thats why he was known as the
Wizard of Sherwood Forest

ANNIE
(amused)
Sherwood Forest huh

HOGARTH
Right And then one day this
Stegosaurus shows up And he says--
(deep voice)
Who thinks he is mightier than me the
mighty thunder lizard

ANNIE
And this is all true now

HOGARTH
Every word Mom -- I wouldnt make this
up So Mickey says Im the two time
American League batting champ I was MVP
of the All-Star game three times running
I go anywhere I please in this forest

We DRIFT BACK from mother and son hunkered down in a pool of
warm flashlight surrounded by darkness

EXT ROCKWELL - THE NEXT MORNING
The sun has risen on a beautiful Maine morning

The camera starts HIGH in a tall tree where a bird is
repairing its storm-damaged nest and pans down from this
literal birds-eye view to the streets of Rockwell where
stoic New Englanders are doing repairs of their own

Down the middle of the street comes Hogarth on a bike In
the wire bike-basket in front of him is a shoebox with holes
punched in the lid

A couple of LOCALS are clearing a felled tree We hear their
conversation as they drift across the screen in Hogarths
travelling POV

FIRST LOCAL
Strangest storm I ever seen Swept away
my best iron wheelbarrow But left the
handles behind

Now Hogarth passes a pair of WOMEN who gossip as they rake up
leaves and branches

FIRST WOMAN
My husband spoke to one of those
fishermen this morning Fellow wouldnt
talk about the shipwreck at all Said
wed all think he was mad

SECOND WOMAN
Now what do you think he meant by that

FIRST WOMAN
Well Im sure I dont know
(lowers her voice)
But it wouldnt surprise me if the
communists are involved
EXT THE CHAT “N° CHEW DINER - DAY

The Chat “n° Chew diner sits near the docks and the town
square the center of all social life in the village
Hogarth arrives at last and parks his bike He takes the
shoebox out of his bike basket opens it a little and speaks
to whatever is inside

HOGARTH
Remember -- be charming

INT DINER - DAY

The diner is packed EVERYBODY is here--FARMERS FISHERMEN --
all swapping storm-stories Its LOUD And theres no empty
table no place to sit

Hogarth enters and looks around He spots Annie now dressed
as a waitress and serving coffee from behind the counter
Hogarth puts on a big smile and waves at her

HOGARTH
Hey Mom You wont believe our good
luck Look what I found

He makes his way through the coffee shop to the counter As
he passes by various local ladies -- THE BUSYBODIES -- look
up from their breakfasts mouths downcast and eyes half-
lidded -- ever ready to cast judgement should the precious
opportunity arise

Hogarth arrives at the counter opens the shoebox for Annie A
baby squirrel pokes its head out Annie rolls her eyes

HOGARTH
His tree musta gotten knocked down in the
storm Can I keep him

ANNIE
Hogarth weve been through this No
pets

HOGARTH

But hes not a pet Mom Hes a friend
Youre always saying I should have more
friends come over right Well now Ive
got one

(selling it)
You gotta admit Im making sense here

ANNIE
Hogarth if theres one thing weve
learned from your many pets its that
claws and furniture do not mix

HOGARTH
I know but--
ANNIE

No buts We have got to rent a room
this year if were going to make ends
meet

Nearby a Busybody perks up her ears elbows her neighbor and
raises her eyebrows significantly

ANNIE (contd)
and no one wants to live in a place
with shredded upholstery

HOGARTH
Youll never know hes there Ill keep
him in a cage--

ANNIE
-until you feel sorry for him and set
him free in the house Remember the
raccoon Hogarth God I remember the
raccoon

HOGARTH
Please mom At least look at him

ANNIE
(softening)
Alright where is this guy

Hogarth grins and reaches down for his box then notices
theres nothing inside it The squirrel has escaped Hogarth
looks back at Annie hiding his desperation

HOGARTH
I will go get him okay

Hogarth turns his eyes darting around frantically Finally
he spies a FURRY TAIL disappearing under a four-person table
with a single occupant hidden behind a newspaper

HOGARTH
Excuse me Excuse me

No response Behind the paper smoke rises

HOGARTH
Sir

Still no response Hogarth is getting exasperated

HOGARTH
Sir Sir Sir EXCUSE ME S--

Hogarth STOPS with sudden realization He slowly pushes down
the top of the paper revealing that the person hes talking
to
is ASLEEP A lit cigarette with an impossibly long ash
dangles precariously from his lips This is DEAN McCOPPEN
35 sporting sunglasses handsome in a rumpled sort of way
Unshaved uncombed unusual A beatnik Here Hogarths heard
of them but this is the first one hes seen up close The
beatniks head lolls

and his cigarette drops in his lap He WAKES

DEAN
I was snoring right Sorry man Im
just not a morning person

HOGARTH
Please dont move sir My pets under
your table--dont look--if you make a
scene my mom wont let me keep him

DEAN
Dont worry sonny Im cool as a cucumb-
(SHRIEK OF PAIN)

He LEAPS up HOLLERING SLAPPING at his smoking pants
ON ANNIE

as she turns to watch the COMMOTION from across the room The
busybodies are all abuzz Who is the weird guy with Hogarth

RESUME DEAN and HOGARTH

as Dean finally gets under control He looks around The
whole joint is staring at him He picks up his cigarette butt
and holds it as he addresses the other diners

DEAN
Had a little cigarette mishap Its under
control Shows over Cool yourselves and
resume breakfasting people
(sitting to Hogarth)
What kind of pet kid

HOGARTH
A squirrel Dont worry hes friendly

ANNIE
Is my son bothering you sir

Dean stares at Annie smiling strangely

DEAN
Yes No Call me Dean

As Dean and Annie size each other up the three Busybodies
whisper cattily back and forth
FIRST BUSYBODY
Oh I dont know why they let such people
in here

SECOND BUSYBODY
She ought to ignore him

THIRD BUSYBODY
You forget how single she is dear

The busybodies exchange smug catty grins
EXT ROCKWELL STREET - DAY

The camera is very low as an official-looking car pulls up
and comes to a stop in front of us its front grille filling
the screen The words US GOVERNMENT are printed boldly
across the top of the license plate

THE CAMERA PULLS OUT

And the drivers side car door opens A well dressed man in
his mid-thirties KENT MANSLEY steps out puffs on his pipe
and surveys his surroundings with a steely-eyed square-jawed
gaze

Now a troubled look comes over him as he notices the US
COVERNMENT decal on his car door is peeling off He presses

it flat -- it curls up again He presses it flat -- it curls
He licks his fingers rubs it on the decal and presses it
hard -- and it holds Kents look of confidence returns He

slams the car door with authority one side of the license
plate unhinges and hangs at an angle Kent sighs with defeat
and walks away

INT DINER - DAY

Annie speaks gently to Hogarth

ANNIE
Hogarth I thought you were getting your
pet honey

HOGARTH

DEAN
(still smiling strangely)
Dean
HOGARTH (CONTD)

Annie shrugs exits Hogarth looks at Dean curiously

DEAN

(maintaining clenched smile)
Up my leg man Squirrels in my pants
Hogarth Im tryin not to wig out here

HOGARTH
Dont wig out

DEAN
(quietly skin crawling)
Okay hes heading north (finally)

Im sorry kid
Dean stands spastically again addresses the room

DEAN
Id like to apologize to everyone in
advance for this

He unzips his fly and out pops the squirrel There is a
collective GASP then a series of shrieks as the squirrel
scampers around the diner Dean zips up and sits back down

DEAN
Check please

Annie GLARES at a sheepish Hogarth
EXT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Kent now holds a clipboard taking notes as he talks to an
OLD FARMER Nearby stands a tractor with a bite taken out of
it

KENT
And did you see any strange lights in the
sky last night Any saucer-shaped flying
objects

FARMER
No

KENT
Were any of your live stock disoriented
this morning Did your cows appear
anxious or depressed

FARMER
No
(getting suspicious
who did you say you worked for again

Kent puffs himself up a little bit
KENT
Frankly Im not at liberty to reveal the
particulars of the agency I work for

He leans in confidentially
KENT
But between you and me I represent the
United States Government UPD The

Unexplained Phenomena Department

The Farmer also leans in confidentially

FARMER
CIA

KENT
Huh Oh uh no Our scope is less
limited than the CIA Unexplained
Phenomena my friend -- that could be
anything

FARMER

You work out of the Pentagon then

KENT
Well sure we work near the Pentagon
yes You know Radcliffe Street

FARMER
No

KENT
Well trust me its pretty much Pentagon
adjacent And all that that implies

FARMER
So what do you think got to my tractor
Something the commies built Some kind of
monster Something from outer space

Kent thinks for a moment then deflates a little

KENT
No its probably something else
(sighs wearily)
Its always something else

He makes a note on his clipboard In the background Dean
approaches and hooks up the tractor to his tow truck and
hauls it away

INT HOGARTHS HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

television We hear CREEPY MUSIC filtered through the tinny
tv speaker CAMERA DRIFTS to

HOGARTH

taking a TWINKIE from a package He SHAKES up a can of
whipped cream jams it into the flat side of the Twinkie
INFLATING it with additional whipped cream He CRAMS the
twinkie in into his mouth never taking his eyes off the
screen

INT HOGARTHS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
Lit by the light of a black and white TV Hogarth has moved
furniture and piled up cushions making a TV watching

fortress

Theres a NOISE OUTSIDE Hogarth jumps Listens Must have
been the TV

ON the TV a scientist and his assistant are involved in some
kind of drama that includes a murderous brain

ANOTHER NOISE OUTSIDE louder this time Hogarth freezes
that didnt come from the TV

ROAR The TV screen goes white with DEAFENING STATIC

HOGARTH
No Not now

He SMACKS the TV no effect He cranks the big channel knob
THUNK-THUNK-THUNK All channels are static

HOGARTH
Stupid antenna

Hogarth stares at the screen gathers his nerve He hefts
his flashlight and warily heads upstairs

EXT THE ROOF - A LOFT WINDOW - NIGHT

Hogarth peers out All quiet just a WHISPER of wind He
crawls out onto the roof his flashlight beam follows the
flat TV wire up the roof toward its peak and stops the
antenna is gone literally torn off the roof

HOGARTH
Gone

Now Hogarth pauses and cocks his head listening In the
distance he hears a heavy BOOM And then another He peers
off into the woods In the distance he seems to see something
moving just above the level of the trees Something
enormous

HOGARTH
Whoa

INT HOGARTHS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Hogarth hurriedly equips himself he tapes a flashlight onto
a toy BB-gun puts on a football helmet Finally he looks

in the mirror and salutes himself

HOGARTH
Hogarth Hughes Ready for action

EXT HOGARTHS HOUSE - NIGHT

Hogarth hurries out runs up to the first massive depression
in the grass Hogarth places his tiny foot beside the car-
size depression and very nearly loses his nerve

He takes a deep breath and hurries into the woods

INT THE WOODS - NIGHT
A dark night fog drifts through trees Spooky At the
forests edge Hogarth looks up sees broken branches where
something entered the woods something big

Hogarth darts from bush to bush follows the trail

TIME DISSOLVE Hogarth creeps on the forest is now dense
More and more the tree-damage begins to take shape a tall
tunnel formed by broken limbs until

Hogarth GASPS the tunnel forms a perfect outline of a HUGE
man-shaped THING He SHIVERS considers turning back but

he cant He creeps on

Hogarth hears a deep RHYTMIC HUMMING that VIBRATES the

ground It sounds strange alien He creeps on

EXT BUSHES NEAR THE POWER STATION - NIGHT

The HUMMING is LOUD Hogarth slowly parts bushes to see a
power station DANGER - HIGH VOLTAGE Tall power lines

towers march through the woods SPARKS SNAP

THUMP A giant metal foot SLAMS into the ground right in
front of Hogarth he YELPS THUMP THUMP THUMP Two huge
feet become two huge legs Hogarth looks up up

A GIANT Made of metal Forty feet tall maybe fifty
Hogarth cant believe his eyes

The giant stares at the metal towers makes a METALLIC GRUNT
that sounds hungry It reaches out and SNAPS off a thick
piece of metal pops it in his mouth CHEWS NOISILY and
SWALLOWS BURP Mmmm good

HOGARTH
Wow it eats metal Cool

Hogarth sits hidden in the bushes and watches fascinated
as the giant grazes the metal towers SPARKS fly from now-
loose flailing powerlines

The giants eaten all the tower arms he TUGS at a solid
metal base its stuck So the giant bends down to EAT his
way down the tall metal tower CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP

Hogarth realizes the giant is CHOMPING toward a mass of thick
power cables that HUMM and SPARK

QUICK INTERCUTS EXTINT HOGARTHS HOUSE AND POWER STATION
- NIGHT

Annie grabs a flashlight by the door illuminates the living
room what a mess And no Hogarth

KA-ZAPPP Electricity races up and down the giants metal
it jerks flies backward trailing SPARKING POWERLINES that
wrap around him as he stumbles into a tangle of more power-
lines KA-ZAP It panics flailing SCREECHING tries to
free itself gets more entangled

Annie searches through the house by flashlight for her son
becoming more and more frantic

ANNIE
Hogarth Hogarth HOGARTH

SPARKS SNAP AND FLY as the giant SHRIEKS in agony A tower
totters and falls smashing into the ground just as Hogarth
jumps clear

Electricity arcs up and down the Giants body The giant
ROARS an AWFUL METAL SOUND falls to its knees eyes
SPARKING SHORTING OUT

Hogarth looks around desperate hes got to save him He

sees a panel EMERGENCY CUT-OFF SWITCH Hogarth runs
toward it sparks raining all around him He grabs the
panel locked He swings his BB-gun like a club CRASH

The gun breaks the panel door pops open Hogarth grabs the
huge switch and throws all his weight against it CLUNK
The SPARKS slowly die away

EXT THE DEEP DARK WOODS - NIGHT

The dazed giant looks around dizzy he stands sways
easily SNAPS free of the wires holding him His eyes focus
down (way down) on Hogarth The boy and the Giant stare at

each other for a long time Now what

ANNIE (0OS)
(CALLING) Hogarth

Hogarth turns down the hill through the fog he sees a
light floating through the trees

HOGARTH
Mom
Hogarth runs down the hill towards the light then stops

turns back toward the giant

but back where the giant stood seconds before is now
only dangling SPARKLING power lines Hes gone

Hogarth stares baffled Annie rushes up

ANNIE
Hogarth

She grabs him by his shoulders tightly more out of fear
than anger
ANNIE (contd)
What do you think youre doing Dont
you know better than to wander off at
night alone What if something happened
to you

HOGARTH
Im sorry mom

Annie throws her arms around him hugging him tight
desperately happy to know that her boy is safe

ANNIE
Dont ever do that to me again Hogarth
I was so scared I thought Id lost
you

A long moment passes with Annie just holding him and
rocking then--

HOGARTH
(softly)
Mom you wont believe it Some-thing ate
our tv antenna

ANNIE
Oh Hogarth

HOGARTH
No Im serious And I went out to see
what it was--

ANNIE
(losing patience)
Hogarth please
HOGARTH

--and it was a Giant metal--

ANNIE
HOGARTH Stop it Im not in the mood
(gentle but firm)
Come on Lets go home

INT ANNIES TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER
Hogarth sits in silence as Annie starts the ignition As
they drive away Hogarth cant help but look back over his
shoulder Backlit by the moon he can just make out the
outline of the Giant half-hidden by the trees watching
them go

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE FOREST TREES - THE NEXT MORNING

The North Maine woods the trees sway holding their secret
deep within
INT ELEMENTARY SCOOL - DAY

The TEACHER is quizzing her students Hogarth is the smallest

The class groans A big kid turns around to Hogarth points
at him and gives him the slit throat sign Hogarth WILTS

EXT POWER STATION - DAY

Workers swarm over the towers repairing the damage Kent is
there smoking a pipe as he talks to a foreman

FOREMAN
Yeah sometimes a linell snap if the
weathers bad sure But for a whole
tower to get twisted up like that
(SCRATCHES HIS HEAD) I tell you its got
me beat

KENT
And not a single witness

FOREMAN
Fraid not sir

KENT
Could this have been caused by a giant
metal monster perhaps

FOREMAN
Pardon me sir
KENT
Nothing Just repeating a yarn I heard
from some fishermen

Just then something catches Kents eye

KENT
Excuse me

He walks a few steps away and hunkers down beside a portion
of the rubble A trapezoidal piece of wood is sticking out
from beneath it Kent pulls it out Its the handle of a BB
gun On Kents look we cut to

EXT CLASSROOM - DAY

Students pour out of Hogarths classroom followed at last by
Hogarth who is a full head smaller than any of them Now
Hogarths face brightens as a few kids his size pass by
Hogarth hurries to catch up with them

HOGARTH
Hey guys

The kids turn to Hogarth without much enthusiasm

FIRST KID
Hey Hogarth

HOGARTH
Listen youre not going to believe what
happened to me last night I went walking
into the forest and I saw this giant

The kids exchange glances

HOGARTH (contd)
It was made out of metal And it tore
apart the power station

For a moment the kids stare at Hogarth blankly Finally one
of them speaks

FIRST KID
You know what I just remembered Im
suppose to help some people do some
stuff way over in some other place right

now

SECOND KID
Oh those people Yeah Im suppose to do
that too

FIRST KID

Nice seeing you Hogarth
As the kids walk away Hogarth hears one of them speak
quietly to the other

FIRST KID
Boy I hope they never skip me a grade

SECOND KID
Hes gotten really desperate

A determined look comes over Hogarths face we cut to
THE WOODS - THAT DAY

Hogarth marches purposefully into the forest with a camera
slung over his shoulder and a sheet of metal in one hand

HOGARTH
Hellllllooo Come ouuut

DISSOLVE TO
DEEPER INTO THE WOODS - A LITTLE LATER
The woods are denser now with shafts of autumn sun
punctuating the darkened light Hogarth bangs the metal
loudly as he walks
HOGARTH
Hey big metal guy Its me the kid
who turned off the power for ya
DISSOLVE TO
A CLEARING IN THE FOREST

Hogarth sets the metal down then retreats a safe distance

HOGARTH
Metal Delicious metal Come and get it

and settles in behind a large log He aims the camera
and waits

And waits

And waits This is clearly not as exciting as Hogarth
expected He rubs his eyes yawns and lays his head on his
arm

And the next thing he knows hes waking up The afternoon
light has given way to the long shadows of early evening
Hogarth looks towards the clearing -- the piece of metal is
gone He gasps

He reaches behind him for the camera as he scans the forest
left and right Suddenly he pauses His hand is not finding
the camera He turns and looks for it Its gone
Above him a flashbulb pops A moment later a roll of film
drops from the sky and lands at his feet Hogarth picks up
the film and swallows hard He looks up a long way up and
sees the Giant standing over him its jaw moving and a
crunching sound coming from its mouth

HOGARTH
Aaaaagh

Hogarth runs as fast as his legs will carry him He covers
twenty feet or so when -- BOOM An enormous metal foot
touches down in front of him He runs faster faster but
with a single step the Giant covers all the distance between
them

Suddenly -- WHACK Hogarth catches a tree limb across the
chin and is sent sprawling to the ground The Giant looms
over him Hogarth sits up his eyes wide with fear and
shouts at the fifty-foot metal monster

HOGARTH
What do you want from me

The Giant sits down with a thud Then he reaches toward
Hogarth with a closed fist turns it palm-upward and opens
his fingers There in his hand is the four-foot metal
handle with EMERGENCY SHUT-OFF printed along its length

HOGARTH
The shut-off switch

Hogarth looks from the handle to the Giant in awe

HOGARTH
You saw me save you

As boy and Giant stare into each others eyes we cut to
INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Some of the BUSYBODIES sit around sipping coffee and
gossiping

FIRST BUSYBODY
Well in my opinion its a womans
obligation to re-marry If not for
herself than for her child

The Busybodies murmur their assent

SECOND BUSYBODY
Do you know she left her little boy all
alone last night My son heard he went
wandering around all by himself Near
the power plant
At the mention of this word a figure at a nearby booth
lowers his newspaper and narrows his eyes Its Kent

THIRD BUSYBODY
Tsk-tsk On the very night those power
lines came down The poor child could
have been killed

The Busybodies gasp in shock and disapproval

FIRST BUSYBODY
It just goes to prove my point She ought
to provide him with a father figure if
she cares about the boy

ANNIE (0S)
She does care about her boy for your
information

Annie enters tying on an apron The Busybodies blush and fan
themselves nervously

ANNIE (contd)
And she thanks you so much for your
concern
(then wearily)
More coffee anyone

KENT (0S)
Id love some

Annie turns Kent gives her his best smile Annie pours
coffee we see Kent studying her with a thoughtful almost

sinister look He glances at her name tag

KENT
Annie What a very lovely name

Annie smiles
INT WOODS - DAY

T Giant and Hogarth sit facing each other each staring at
the other with curiosity

HOGARTH
So what are you

The Giant tilts his head curiously but says nothing

HOGARTH
Do you talk

The Giant continues staring puzzled

HOGARTH (contd)
Talk You know words Blah-blah-
blah like that Can you do that --
Blah-blah-blah

The Giant opens and closes his mouth in imitation of Hogarth
A series of deep metallic rumblings and clangings come out of
his mouth

HOGARTH
Well you get the concept anyway But
we need to work on your vocabulary
Lets see

Hogarth looks around sees a rock and picks it up
HOGARTH

The Giant pulls a tree out of the ground

GIANT

A very tired Hogarth is still seated (uncomfortably now) in
front of a still awe-struck Giant The Giant picks up a piece
of wood

HOGARTH
(tired)

GIANT

The Giant picks up another piece of wood

HOGARTH

Rog

HOGARTH

Look weve pretty much covered

Hogarth waves to the Giant and EXITS Now Hogarth hears a
BOOM behind him He turns to see the Giant following him

HOGARTH
And dont follow me either

The Giant continues following happily
HOGARTH (CONTD)
I said dont Dont follow me Stay Go
home I mean it

EXT RAILROAD TRACKS NEAR HOGARTHS HOME - DAY

A fog is settling in as Hogarth leaves the forest and
crosses a set of railroad tracks He points to the house at the
bottom of the hill

HOGARTH

Look Thats where I live okay Im
going there and youre not understand
So goodbye Hey

He turns to see the Giant kneeling curiously beside the
railroad tracks He pokes at them

GIANT
(HUNGRY SOUND)

HOGARTH
Hey wait a minute--

Too late The Giant bites down on the twin strands of
railroad track and rips them loose like spaghetti

HOGARTH
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOURE DOING

The Giant freezes puzzled long strings of railroad track
dangling from his month

HOGARTH (contd)
Put them back

Now the Giant looks confused and guilty DING DING DING The
crossing signal blares red lights flash The Giant stares at
the pretty lights entranced

Hogarth GASPS looks down the tracks He hears a distant
whistle blow WOO-WOOO

HOGARTH (contd)
Oh no (HE RUNS TO THE GIANT) Put them
back RIGHT NOW

The Giant stares puzzled Hogarth GROANS runs to a piece of
track sticking up and pushes down on it with all his
weight it doesnt budge

HOGARTH (contd)
Like this Help me

The Giant sees Hogarth struggling with the curled tracks
takes one index finger and helpfully pushes on them KA-
BLAM Theyre down
HOGARTH (contd)
Good Thats it

The Giant grunts pleased with himself Hogarth HEARS the
train close now And then he sees-- the pieces of track

dont meet up

HOGARTH (contd)
Put them together Like this

Hogarth pantomimes The Giant lines up one track--

HOGARTH
Now the other one hurry

-- then tries to line up the other side but its tricky the
two chewed-on rails stubbornly resist lining up Finally the
giant gets them close

HOGARTH
Good enough Come on

Hogarth takes off racing like the wind to get out of there
He STOPS looks back

THE GIANT
is still fussing with the tracks trying to get them perfect

HOGARTH
No Come on The trains coming

The Giant is intent on his puzzle CLICK CLICK Almost Now
we see the headlight of a big freight train coming out of the

fog The Giant continues to fuss

HOGARTH
The train

The Giant finally SNAPS the track into place CLICK He
grins A train whistle SHRIEKS The startled Giant looks up
as Hogarth hits the dirt and--

KA-BLOOM

EXT FOREST NEAR POWER STATION - CONTINUOUS

Kent examines the broken branches Hears the BOOM of the
train wreck

RESUME TRAIN CROSSING - CONTINUOUS
Steam flies The EXPLOSION dies away Hogarth looks up

The Giant is gone The train its front end smashed coasts
down the track breaks squealing Hogarth looks around
Then THUMP The Giants head lands beside him

An arm falls here a leg there A hand flies down the hill
toward Hogarths house

HOGARTH
Oh no

Hogarth sees the giant lying around in big pieces He
touches the Giants hand gently a look of pain and sadness
on his face

HOGARTH
(WHIMPERS)

And then behind him the Giants head still attached to its
torso sits up Hogarth YELPS The Giants eyes spark flash
and click on He looks around dazed at his scattered parts

HOGARTH
Youre alive

The torso has one leg and most of one arm attached The other
pieces seem to come alive and scamper around as if confused
An antenna rises out of the top of the Giants head and
begins to signal All the pieces SNAP to attention They
crawl toward the Giant who gathers them up in his arm and
looks at Hogarth confused Just then we hear voices coming
from the fog

VOICE
Hello Is anyone out there Are you
alright

Hogarth squints into the fog

HOGARTH
The train Conductor Oh were in trouble
now

HOGARTH

(turns to Giant)
Okay look Ive changed my mind You
can follow me home

He hurries off down the hill with the one-legged Giant
hopping along behind him

INT HOGARTHS BARN - DAY
Hogarth enters the barn with the hopping Giant behind him

HOGARTH
You can stay here for now

The Giant takes a seat and sets his body parts down beside
him The Giants arm parts dutifully line up the arm first
He picks it up and jams it into its socket

HOGARTH
And try to keep it quiet okay My moms
not too big on me having any pets right
now Shhhh -- get it

EXT TRAIN TRACKS - CONTINUOUS

The train ENGINEER and a CONDUCTOR are examining the tracks
in the swirling fog

CONDUCTOR
Whatever we hit it was something big A
tractor maybe

ENGINEER

CONDUCTOR
So where the heck did it go

Out of the fog comes Kent pipe in hand He casts a glance at
the Conductor and the Engineer then turns and looks down the
hill towards Hogarths house

INT HOGARTHS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Giant finishes attaching his leg and is now all together
save for a missing HAND He looks around the barn for it

INT HOGARTHS HOUSE - THAT NIGHT
Annie and Hogarth sit at the dinner table

ANNIE
Would you say grace please

Hogarth folds his hands together and starts to bow his head
when he STOPS behind Annie the Giants hand crawls across
the kitchen floor like a tarantula
HOGARTH
OH MY GOD

Annie looks up Hogarth rolls his eyes to heaven

HOGARTH (contd)

Oh my God we thank you for the uh
food that Mom has put in front of us and--
STOP

Hogarth jumps up The curious hand-- now standing up on two
fingers and reaching for an antique vase-- reacts to
Hogarths tone and shrinks back Hogarth sees Annie staring
at him Again he covers --

HOGARTH (contd)

(TO HAND)

LIVING ROOM - FRONT ENTRANCE

Hogarth runs up to the hand blocking it from going to the
cellar He takes one of the enormous fingers with both hands
and leads it like a baby elephant to the front door He
opens the door revealing--

--KENT startled about to knock He smiles his most charming
smile Hogarth GASPS SLAMS the door He breathes hard
panicking But when he turns around the hand is GONE

INT HOGARTHS DINING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Hogarth Annie and Kent are seated at the dinner table Kent
is pouring on the charm to Annie as Hogarth continues to eye
him suspiciously Kent pats his stomach

a toilet flushes upstairs A puzzled expression

KENT

ANNIE

INT UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Kent
Hogarth yanks open the door revealing

The giant hand which crouches on the sink as it unrolls a
pile of toilet paper into a pile on the floor Hogarth shuts
the door behind him startling the hand which leaps to the
floor with a THUD

BACK TO THE DINNER TABLE

Kent and Annie react to the sound and stare at the ceiling

ANNIE
Excuse me

She exits
INT UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Hogarth labors as he pulls the giant hand toward the open
window The hand resists mildly like a distracted child--

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM
Annie stands outside the door She knocks

ANNIE
Hogarth Are you alright

INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kent turns his attention to the sounds coming from upstairs
He exits

INT UPSTAIRS BATHROOM

Using his whole body Hogarth tries to shove the giant hand
out the open window

HOGARTH
(GRUNTING SOUNDS)

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM
Kent has joined Annie and the two of them listen together

HOGARTH
(LOUDER GRUNTING)

KENT
This sort of thing is why its so
important to really chew your food
Annie shoots Kent a disapproving look

INT UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

With a mighty shove he finally manages to get the hand out
the window

HOGARTH
--rrrrrgggggghhhhh

The hand lands with a terrific crash Hogarth tumbles to the
ground and Annie and Kent burst in through the door to
REVEAL--—

Hogarth sheepishly standing there in a large PILE of
unrolled toilet paper

ANNIE
Good lord youve been acting strange
lately

Kent looks from Hogarth to the open window In the darkness
outside he seems to see a shadowy figure moving in the dark
He turns to Annie and gives her his patented smile

KENT
Do you have a telephone I could use

INT HOGARTHS LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Kent hunkered into a corner in an attempt at privacy speaks
into a telephone in a loud whisper Kent peers around
cautiously making sure hes not observed

KENT
--let me put it bluntly sir Im onto
something big in Rockwell Maine

CHIEF
(tired)

KENT
This time -- well this time its a

CHIEF
(TIRED) That sounds swell Kent

KENT
And when I do Im going to want a memo

memo carbon copied and -- and

The Chief hangs up As Kent stands with the phone receiver in
his hand a look of dark determination comes over his face

And then we pan up through the ceiling above Kent into
Hogarths room Hogarth also holds a phone receiver with
one hand cupped over the mouthpiece He looks worried
EXT HOGARTHS HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

Annie says goodbye to Hogarth at the front door

ANNIE
Bye Honey Have a good day at school

HOGARTH
(WAVING) Bye Mom

Hogarth pedals his bike away until hes out of sight of the
front house then zips around the side of the house ditches
his bike and grabs a little red wagon

IN A QUICK MONTAGE

Hogarth pulls the wagon around collecting metal He finds
some cans an old car muffler a fallen street sign etc

INT HOGARTHS BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Hogarth enters and finds the Giant sleeping

HOGARTH
Ahem

The Giant opens his eyes He sees the wagon full of metal and
looks delighted

GIANT
(HUNGRY SOUND)

HOGARTH
It wasnt easy to fill this wagon So try
to not to eat it all at once--

The Giant picks the wagon up and dumps its entire contents
into his mouth Hogarth is speechless

HOGARTH
Do you have any idea what it took to find
that metal I scoured the neighborhood
I had to ditch school Ive never done
that before I--

The Giant picks up the wagon and eats that too Hogarth sighs
and takes a seat

HOGARTH
So now that weve eaten how shall we
spend the rest of our day
The Giant looks at him not understanding

HOGARTH
Okay Ill teach you more words

Hogarth stands up and points at his house

HOGARTH
That is my home Thats where I come
from My
(points at himself)
home

Hogarth points to his house The Giant looks at it

GIANT
(METALLIC CLANKING THAT SOUNDS SOMETHING
LIKE HOME)

HOGARTH

Right Now where is
(points at giant)
your home

The Giant looks at Hogarths house then follows Hogarths
pointing hand and looks at himself Then a look of deep
sadness comes over his face His shoulders shrug and his
hands turn palm-upward in a puzzled gesture

GIANT
(PUZZLED ANGUISHED SOUND)

HOGARTH
You mean you dont know where you came
from

GIANT

(ANGUISHED INARTICULATE GIANT SOUNDS)

HOGARTH
Wow You poor guy

Now we hear a deep rumbling sound The Giant looks down at
his stomach hungrily

HOGARTH
I know I know
(thinks for a moment)
Okay I know a place where its all you
can eat But not until after dark

The Giant stares at him uncomprehending

HOGARTH
Let me put it this way
He points at through the window at the sun

HOGARTH
Sun

GIANT
Suuughn

HOGARTH

When the sun goes down

Hogarth mimes the sun arcing down the sky to sunset The he
taps on the Giants iron belly

HOGARTH
Feeding time Get it

GIANT
(COMPREHENDING SOUND)

HOGARTH
Good

Hogarth starts to leave then pauses and turns back to look
at the Giant

HOGARTH
Youre smarter than you look arent you

GIANT
(puzzled sound)

HOGARTH
(exiting)
Never mind

EXT ROCKWELL

In a time-lapse we see the sun arc across the sky and set
over picturesque Rockwell Maine

EXT HOGARTHS BARN - NIGHT

Two silhouettes creep into the night -- one small one
enormous

EXT OPEN COUNTRY - NIGHT

A ways off Hogarth relaxes

HOGARTH
Come on Lets go

Hogarth starts walking The Giant moves past him- BOOM BOOM
BOOM -and with a half dozen strides is almost out of sight
HOGARTH
STOP

On the horizon the giant turns looks puzzled now what

HOGARTH
Not that fast Sheesh Come back here

BOOM BOOM BOOM In two seconds the giant stands at
Hogarths side and looks down at him confused

HOGARTH
Pick me up OK

The giant does as hes told lowers his huge hand to the
ground Hogarth climbs up on it The giant carefully raises
up his hand with Hogarth on it Hogarth grabs onto a
finger and points toward the northwest

HOGARTH
Okay now March

Hogarth hangs on for dear life as the giant quickly
accelerates Hogarth looks down and GASPS theyre really
moving

EXT POWER PLANT - NIGHT

Kent is hunting around the power plant with a flashlight
muttering to himself

KENT
(scornful)
Evidence Ill get your evidence

He scans the vast expanse of forest with his flashlight and
sags hopelessly

KENT
somewhere

EXT HILLS OUTSIDE ROCKWELL - LATER

Hogarth and the Giant are marching along a back road on the
hills outside town

FROM HOGARTHS POV
Its like a magic carpet ride as the moon-lit countryside
below sails past his vantage point fifty feet above the

ground Hogarth points at a church steeple

HOGARTH
Church Churrrch

GIANT
Churrr- (CRUNCH)
HOGARTH
Yes People pray there
(points at another building)
School Can you say that Schooool

GIANT
Skooo

HOGARTH
Schooool suuuucks

GIANT
Skoooo saauuugz

HOGARTH
Very good And thats all you need to
know about school

EXT WOODS

Kent has wandered some distance from the power plant now His
flashlight beam sweeps across the ground

KENT
Nothing Nothing

Just then he hears a noise behind him He stops Wheels
around -- and the beam of his flashlight catches--

--a MOOSE Huge Enormous antlers Looking right at him The
moose SNORTS Kent backpedals stumbles backward into a ditch-

KENT
Whooooa

--loudly enough to scare off the moose He gets up dusts
himself off shines his flashlight around and discovers what
hes standing in is not a ditch at all but a--

GIANT FOOTPRINT perfectly preserved in a patch of dried mud

Kent GASPS The gasp becomes a sound of delight He begins
to laugh

And then a single rain drop falls on head Kent looks up
Another drop falls

The laughter ceases
EXT WOODS

Hogarth is still riding on the Giants shoulder Rain has
begun to drizzle down now

HOGARTH
And that building there is the coffee
shop

GIANT
Kau-(CLANG) shawww

HOGARTH
Thats where my mom works Sometimes she
has to stay late to make extra money
cause well my Dads away You know
what a dad is A father

GIANT
“Fa-grrr

HOGARTH
Yeah Its like me
(points at himself)
Only bigger

He raises a hand indicating somone taller

HOGARTH
He used to take me to baseball games
This one time we brought binoculars and
we tried to figure out what pitch the
catcher was calling One year we want to
go to every home game I mean-- we
wanted to

The Giant stops walking and swivels his enormous head to face
Hogarth For a moment they stare at each other in silence
with the rain pouring down around them Then Hogarth bursts
out almost angrily

HOGARTH
Aw what am I even talking to you for
You cant understand a word Im saying

The Giant continues staring

HOGARTH
Can you

The Giant speaks --and somewhere within the metal clanging of
his voice there seems to be a note of sympathetic sadness

GIANT
“Fa-grrrr

Hogarth sighs and pats the Giant on the side of the head
HOGARTH
Well I guess its better than talking to
myself

The Giant looks pleased by this They continue on their way
EXT WOODS

Kent soaked to the bone is sitting on the edge of the Giant
footprint which has become a soggy nondescript mess

KENT
God hates me

He pulls out his pipe and tries to light it but his soggy
matches wont strike

KENT
Damnation
(shouting heavenward)
Cant a guy get a break around here

Suddenly the rain lets up Kent looks surprised Then
pleased He lights his pipe Then turns to heaven again

KENT
Thank you Waaagh

He does a huge double take as he looks up to see the Giants
smiling head looming above him The Giant picks up Kents
metal flashlight eats it and in three strides is gone from
sight leaving the terrified and exhilarated Kent behind
UNDER THE GIANTS CHIN

-Hogarth PEEKS OUT breathing hard

HOGARTH
That cant be good

EXT DEANS JUNKARD - NIGHT
A metal graveyard sprawling as far as the eye can see

HOGARTH (0OS)
This is it

The Giants metal hand sets Hogarth down into frame

HOGARTH
All you can eat

The Giant surveys the metal in all directions MOANING
happily as he spies a huge stack of cars He selects one

and slowly carefully bites into it

GIANT
(DELIGHTED SOUND)

He selects another car picks it up and bites into it like a
gourmand tasting a fine chocolate

GIANT (contd)
Mmmm
He tastes another

GIANT (contd)
Ooooooh

--causing the CAR HORN TO BLAST

HOGARTH
SHHHH Turn it off turn it OFF

The giant looks around nervously helplessly beginning to
PANIC He tries shaking it then sitting on it but nothing
works the horn is STUCK

Hogarth looks back toward the house--
AT THE FAR END OF THE JUNKYARD
A light goes on in a little house

Finally the Giant takes a monster chomp and snaps the car in
half The horn strangles into silence

EXT JUNKYARD HOUSE

Dean reaches the door opens it a GASPING out-of-breath
Hogarth stands on his doorstep Dean studies Hogarth for a
moment Then breaks into a smile

DEAN

HOGARTH

Dean presses an espresso

HOGARTH

NOISES from outside Dean jumps up

DEAN

He grabs a crowbar runs to the door Hogarth jumps up

HOGARTH
No wait Stop

EXT DEANS HOME - NIGHT
The door flies open Dean leaps out YELLS

He hears a metallic GASP He looks up up up and sees the
gargantuan Giant tailpipes sticking out of his mouth

frozen a guilty caught look on its face Dean YELPS

DEAN
--my god RUN KID RUN

HOGARTH
(rolls his eyes)
Its OK

But the heroic Dean seizes Hogarth and turns to duck inside--

--which the giant immediately interprets as a threat and--
--SLAMS his massive hand in front of the door blocking it
Hogarth tries to break free of Dean to explain--

HOGARTH
The giant isnt--let GO

as the giant GRABS DEAN hoisting him high in the air

HOGARTH
DONT SQUASH HIM DO NOT SQ--

The giant STOPS--looks down at Hogarth puzzled

the now-tired giant YAWNING

HOGARTH
Lets get you tucked in
EXT DEANS JUNKYARD - NIGHT

Hogarth smiles to himself as he watches the giant sleep now
covered with a layer of junk a camouflage-comforter

And then he hears a BEEPING NOISE Hogarth looks up and sees
an ARMY PLANE flying towards him

The BEEPING gets louder Hogarth realizes its coming from

the Giant Suddenly WHIR a panel on the giants arm slides
open A strange device pops out and starts tracking the plane
overhead

Hogarth panics as the plane comes nearer the BEEPING becomes
more insistent the strange device tracks the plane it looks
very retro-advanced and scary

The giant starts MOANING thrashing in his sleep as if caught
in a bad dream Suddenly he wakes up and ka-CHUK--the device
withdraws The plane disappears over the trees

Hogarth looks at the giant stunned The giant unaware
looks at Hogarth puzzled

HOGARTH
Its okay Go back to sleep It was just

a bad dream

The giant nods comforted and drops off into sleep Hogarth
walks away deeply troubled

INT HOGARTHS HOUSE
Hogarth creeps upstairs to his room pulls back the covers
and is just about to dive in when Annie enters spies

at home in a fatherly way is --

HOGARTH

He feels Kents knowing eyes boring into him

HOGARTH
Moooooooom

Annie appears carrying a plate of waffles She sets a plate
down and leans in towards Hogarth beaming

ANNIE
Isnt it wonderful Hogarth We finally
got a border

HOGARTH
(PANICKED) Oh no

Kent looks at his watch

KENT
You know I meant to wake up bright and
early this morning But from the look of
those waffles Im still in bed dreaming

ANNIE
Oh Mr Mansley--
(Kent wags a finger)
-- Kent

Kent and Annie share a meaningful look Hogarth looks ill

HOGARTH
Uh Im not very hungry

He exits Kent watches him go then picks up the fork that
Hogarth was holding and surreptitiously drops it in a little
plastic evidence bag

INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Hogarth strolls in and takes a seat at the counter next to a
man reading a newspaper A bored waitress approaches

HOGARTH
Chocolate malted please
(she exits)
Ive never been in here Mom says the
coffees weak and they put meat extender
in the hamburger

MAN BEHIND NEWSPAPER
It aint the diner sparky But its more
private

The man lowers the paper to reveal his face Its Dean He
glances around cautiously to make sure theyre not being
watched

DEAN
So Your friends got quite an appetite

HOGARTH
Yeah When I found him he was trying to
eat the power station

DEAN
So where does he come from

HOGARTH
(shrugs)
He doesnt know

DEAN
You can talk to him

HOGARTH
Kinda He cant say a lot of words yet
but he understands things pretty good

DEAN
I wonder if he had something to do with
the meteorite that splashed down here the
other day Then again maybe he was the
meteorite

HOGARTH
Thats what I was thinking He came from
outer space

DEAN
Maybe Or maybe he was launched into
space from earth

HOGARTH
Hey maybe the commies made him You
know in one of their secret labs

DEAN
Or maybe we built him in one of ours
Our government has secrets too you know

HOGARTH
(getting into it)
Or maybe he comes from underground you
know Like hes this undiscovered
species that evolved from minerals or
something while we were evolving out of
monkeys

DEAN
Maybe kid And then again maybe the
monkeys evolved from us

Dean laughs and puts his hands behind his head and strikes
philosophical pose

HOGARTH
I wish we knew why he was here

DEAN
Hey I wish I knew why I was here

Hogarth puts his hands behind his head and strikes a
philosophical pose too He seems to be enjoying the adult
conversation

HOGARTH
Yeah

DEAN
I mean if you think about it nobody
really knows where they came from why
theyre here or where theyre going We
believe We hope But we dont know

HOGARTH
Right right

DEAN
And some cats that scares em you know

HOGARTH
Youre telling me

DEAN
They race around play the game chase
money Chase power

HOGARTH
Just so they wont have to wonder what
lifes all about

DEAN
Exactly
(beat suddenly impressed)
Hey

Dean lifts his coffee cup saluting Hogarth They sit in
silence for a moment happily contemplating the universe

INT DARK LABORATORY

a
As Kent looks on an AGENT in a lab coat studies a spoon --
now dusted with white powder -- under a microscope

After a moment he looks up and gestures at the BB-gun also
dusted with powder which lies on the table nearby The Agent
turns to the man in shadow standing over him

LAB-COAT AGENT
Its the same fingerprint

A match is struck We follow it up to the mans pipe already
in his mouth As the match flares it lights up Kents face
He smiles diabolically

INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Hogarth contentedly slurps the last of his malted through a
plastic straw Dean works on a slab of apple pie

HOGARTH
Hey Dean

DEAN
Yeah

HOGARTH
What is life all about For you I mean

DEAN

For me Well
(shrugs)

I guess Id like to prove theres
something pure in me you know They say
the soul is part angel and part monster
Sometimes I think life is a chance to set
the angel free

HOGARTH
The Giant looks like a monster But
inside hes good I can tell

DEAN
I hope youre right kid The world
could use an angel that size

HOGARTH
You wont tell anybody about him will
you

DEAN

Nah Hes an outsider Ive got a soft
spot for outsiders

EXT HOGARTHS HOUSE - DAY

Hogarth comes riding home on his bike He parks it at the
side of the house and starts to go inside then hesitates
He holds out a hand and feels a drop of rain looks up at
the clouds then takes his bike and wheels it toward the
barn instead

EXT BARN - DAY
Hogarth opens the barn door and GASPS
HOGARTHS POV

Kent and the labcoat AGENT sit at a small improvised lab
table Nearby are four OTHER AGENTS in suits and ties

artist conceptions of the giant They look up aghast

HOGARTH
Moooom

INT KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER

Kent and the agents sit stoically at the breakfast table
Annie stands facing them with folded arms Hogarth stands
nearby scowling

ANNIE
So you work for the government

KENT
Thats right

A long PAUSE

ANNIE
Our government

KENT
Of course Annie please let me
explain Every once in a while things
happen to people that just cant be
rationalized in a conventional way The
Unexplained Phenomena Department was
created to respond to the bizarre the
strange the--well unexplainable events
that happen every day all across this
great land From the mountains to the
prairies to the oceans--

ANNIE
(interrupts)

Do you actually work in Washington

KENT
Yes indeed Washington DC

As Kent begins to wax on about his work we CUT TO

FLASHBACK WASHINGTON DC - MORNING
Kent strides briskly through the crisp morning air making
his way through many equally ambitous go-getters on their way
to do the nations work Familiar Washington monuments fill
the background

KENT (VO CONTD)
if youre of a mind to be a mover and
a shaker its the only place to be

FLASHBACK GOVERNMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

Kent enters an impressive government building While most of
the workforce heads up the massive marble stairs Kent heads
down the narrow stairs off to the side

KENT (VO CONTD)
A place where an individual with pluck
and ambition can really get ahead

FLASHBACK GOVERNMENT BUILDING SUBLEVEL - NARROW HALLWAY

Kent walks down the endless row of identical doors stopping
in front of one labeled UNEXPLAINED PHENOMENA DEPT Kent
unlocks the door and enters a sparse windowless office not
much larger than the desk in the center of it

KENT (VO CONTD)
safe in the knowledge that the vast
resources of the US Government are at
ones disposal

FLASHBACK KENTS OFFICE

Kent sits idly at his desk evenly spacing a row of sharpened
pencils across the desktop Clearly theres no action here

KENT (VO CONTD)
Although were simply inundated with
calls we limit ourselves to only the
most demanding cases Its a challenge I
wont deny it

The phone finally RINGS and Kent SEIZES it hungrily
FLASHBACK APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

A couple of slack-jawed yokels gape as Kent pulls a large
deflated baloon down from a tree US WEATHER SERVICE

stenciled on its side Kent displays it to them glaring
They grin sheepishly

KENT (VO CONTD)
I could tell you many strange stories
but unfortunately all of them are
classified
RESUME ANNIES KITCHEN - KENT and COMPANY
Kent leans back in his chair his story told
KENT
I hope that helps to calm some of your
worries Annie And you too Hogarth
Hogarth

(then smiling to Annie)
For his own good of course

of deep concern

Hogarth takes a seat on the porch beside Dean who is

scanning the hills with binoculars

DEAN

HOGARTH

Yeah Its not too hard to lose those

DEAN

Dont get cocky Even guys in suits can

HOGARTH

Why do they want to get him anyway

DEAN
Thats generally all it takes

HOGARTH

They dont even know him and they just

assume hes dangerous

They stare out at the Giant as he opens a car hood plucks

DEAN

Thats what worries me We dont know

may be gentle but on the inside he could

be a killer
The Giant looks up curiously Hogarth shushes Dean

HOGARTH
(whispering)
Dont use that word around him

DEAN
Why not

HOGARTH

Because he cares I cant explain it
but he cares about what he is Hes
getting so he can understand all kinds of

stuff now If he hears you use

DEAN

Surprise
HOGARTH

Kent What are you doing in my room

He goes to the phonograph and puts it on the platter

HOGARTH

HOGARTH

Kent starts to undulate awkwardly to the music

KENT

Hogarth edges toward the door Kent follows still dancing

KENT (contd)
Friends Hogarth thats what we ought to
be But friends dont keep secrets from
each other

HOGARTH
I dont know what youre talking about

KENT
You dont Well let me tell you a little
story Your mom says you like ‘em

Kent steps in front of the doorway his smile now chilling

KENT
Once there was a boy who walked into a
forest He wanted to take a picture of a
metal-eating giant -- but lo and behold
the giant ate his camera alllll up

Hogarth looks baffled

HOGARTH
How did you --

KENT
Because in the process the Giant snapped
a picture of himself
(holds up a roll of film)
And the little boy brought the film home

Hogarth lunges for the roll of film

HOGARTH
Give it back

Kent dangles the film over Hogarths head for a moment then
drops it into Hogarths hands Hogarth looks at it

HOGARTH
Empty
Kent slips a black-and-white photo from his coat and hands
it to Hogarth It shows the Giants face its mouth wide
open

KENT
The Army arrives in twenty-four hours
Hogarth Just thought youd like to know

Kent dances out of the room Hogarth stares helpless
INT HOGARTHS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kent puffs on his pipe as Annie knits Hogarth sits ina
chair studying them Kent breaks the silence

KENT
Well isnt this a fine way to spend an
evening Were like one big happy
family

Hogarth looks up staring darkly at Kent

HOGARTH
Youre not family And when my Dad finds
out you sat in his chair hell hunt you
down like a dog--

ANNIE
Hogarth

Kent turns to Annie He makes a half-hearted gesture of
getting out of his chair

KENT
(starting to rise)
Im sorry should I

ANNIE
No no dont get up My husband --
Hogarths father -- hes he was an
Air Force Pilot in Korea A casualty

HOGARTH

turns to Annie

KENT

HOGARTH
No youre not

ANNIE
Hogarth
HOGARTH
But Mom this guy doesnt care about
anything -- cats like him race around
play the game chase money chase
powerbut he keeps buttering you up so

ANNIE
Hogarth that is enough I think you owe
our guest an apology

KENT
(chuckling)
Oh now theres no need for that
Hogarth is right in a way Im certainly
ambitious Yes
(looks pointedly at Annie)
Ambitious career-minded stable --

HOGARTH
Hes doing it again

Kent gives Hogarth a patronizing smile

KENT
Hogarth I would have thought a good
American boy like yourself would have
more respect for the work I do The world
has become a dangerous place you know
The balance of power is delicate I
gather information And the side that
has the information is the side that will
win

Hogarth fixes his eyes on Kent with an intensity thats
unnerving

HOGARTH
They say the soul is part angel and part
monster One look at you and I know the
monster is gonna win

ANNIE
Thats it You either apologize or go
right up to bed right now

Hogarth throws up his hands and marches out of the room

ANNIE
Honestly I dont know where hes getting
these wild ideas Hes starting to talk
like that beatnik

KENT
Beatnik

INT HOGARTHS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Hogarth is in bed the lights are out Annie appears in his
doorway silhouetted by the light in the hall She lingers
for a moment thoughtful

ANNIE
Have you been out at the junkyard
Hogarth

HOGARTH

(after a long pause)
Which junkyard

ANNIE
The only junkyard Deans junkyard

HOGARTH
(another pause)
If I had would you be mad at me
ANNIE
No

(sad smile)
Tell him hi for me

She EXITS Hogarth stares at the ceiling and sighs
EXT TOWN - NEXT DAY

A convoy of Army vehicles is pouring into town Kent watches
them enter euphoric He glances at his watch and
remembering an appointment rushes off

INT COFFEE SHOP - DAY

An Army General sits at a booth studying a map Kent sits
across from his positively glowing with pride

GENERAL
Hills valleys woods ravines Lot of
places to hide around here

KENT
Yes its remarkable isnt it sir

Kent looks around at the various coffee-shop Busybodies and
speaks loudly for their benefit

KENT (CONTD)
That one man working alone could have
single-handedly found a monster ina
place like this

The Busybodies coo and murmum amongst themselves
GENERAL
(still studying map)
Hard to know where to start really

KENT
Well sir perhaps I can be of some help
in that regard You see Ive had my eye
on an odd little boy who seems to be
connected to the creature in question
And I have reason to believe hes been
spending some time at a local scarpyard

From behind the counter Annie looks sharply at Kent
understanding his attentions

GENERAL
Can you take me there

KENT
But of course sir
(loudly for the busybodies)
When a five-star general needs my help
Im only too eager to oblige

Annie comes by and refills their coffee

INT DEAN

ANNIE
Im the mother of that odd little boy

KENT
(uncomfortable)
Oh yes ahem

ANNIE
And if youre going up to the junkyard

S STUDIO - DAY

Dean is welding a sculpture of a hooded executioner

of an axe

Sickle part Stars and Stripes

Instead

the executioner wields a flag -- part Hammer and

DEAN
Come in

Theres a knock at his door

In walks the General and Kent followed by a few soldiers

Annie comes in last

DEAN
I assume youre here for the Lenny Bruce
albums

KENT
Watch the wise cracks Beatnik We

Dean takes off his welding goggles and
DEAN
We all represent America man

GENERAL

Sir my name is General Shannon Rogard
We have reason to believe you are
harboring a large

(finding this hard to swallow)
creature whose interest run counter
to those of the United States Do you
deny it

DEAN
(shrugs)
Hey man if a cat needs to flop my pad
springs eternal

The General and the Soldiers exchange puzzled glances One of
them leans towards the General and speaks in hushed tones

SOLDIER
As I understand it sir a cat is a
member of the counter-culture

GENERAL
What rank

SOLDIER
Well

As the General and the Soldiers continue to confer Annie
steps forward and speaks to Dean

ANNIE
Is Hogarth here Is he alright These
people say he may be in some kind of
trouble

DEAN
Hes not here Annie But he is alright
(then gently)
Believe me I would never let anything
happen to that little guy

Annie and Dean share a look Kent sees this and loses his
cool

KENT
Alright Ive had enough

He turns to the soldiers

KENT (CONTD)
You and you Start rummaging around Tip
some tables over Kick open doors Break
stuff You know the drill
Kent claps his hands The soldiers dont move

DEAN
(to Kent)
We all hear you yacking daddy-o but no
ones listening

Kent seethes

KENT
(under his breath)
Not yet Not yet

Annie looks from one to the other comparing
INT WOODS - DAY

The Giant strolls through the forest with Hogarth on his
shoulder

HOGARTH
I know this is hard for you to
understand butwell it might be a
real long time before we get to hang out
like this again

The Giant is oblivious to anything but the beauty of the day
He turns his face up towards the sun as it ours through the
trees Birds are singing All is peaceful

GIANT
(CONTENTED SOUND)

HOGARTH
Yeah it is beautiful isnt it

Through a patch in the trees they spot a deer

GIANT
(CURIOUS SOUND)

HOGARTH
Its a deer Deeeer

GIANT
Deeeer

The Giant takes a step towards it It darts away Hogarth
points

HOGARTH
That way

Full of childlike curiosity the Giant follows and a game of
hide and seek begins Hogarth laughs happily as they dart
in and out of the trees At last he finds the deer grazing in
a clearing The Giant is FASCINATED

HOGARTH
(whisper)
Shhhhh lets get closer

The Giant tries to sneak nearer leaning on a pair of tall

trees which begin to teeter He grabs one and as he quietly
pushes it back into place the other crashes to the ground
T
da

e treetop lands near the deer who bolts away from it and
irectly toward the Giant--almost into the Giants foot

The deer STOPS puzzled by the strange metal obstacle He
looks up right to the Giants face The Giant SMILES--

--which SPOOKS the deer who darts off in the other direction

The Giant reaches out and catches it in one huge hand like
a kid trapping a butterfly

HOGARTH
You caught it

The Giant laughs and opens his hand The deer lies
motionless The Giant and Hogarth look stunned The Giant
tenderly lays the deer down on the ground kneels and nudges
the deer with a big finger Nothing It doesnt move

HOGARTH
Its dead

GIANT
Deh

There is a long silence The Giant nudges the deer again

HOGARTH
(suddenly vehement)
Dont do that Its dead Okay That
means its not going to move Its gone
And its not coming back understand
(softly tears flowing)
Its not ever going to come back

It begins to snow softly From high above through the trees
the boy and the giant stare down at the lifeless deer They bow
their heads in sorrow

EXT JUNKYARD - LATER

The snow falls harder now The depressed giant sits ona
hillside snow piling up on his motionless bulk staring out
into the forest Dean and Hogarth watch him worried

DEAN
This is bad This is very bad The
Armys on its way Weve got to get him
out of here

HOGARTH
He doesnt know how to think about it

DEAN
Youve got talk to him Youve got to
get through to him

HOGARTH
Me I dont know about this stuff

DEAN
You know as much as anyone does kid And
he trusts you Speak from your heart
Its the only chance weve got

Hogarth looks at the Giant

HOGARTH
Alright Ill try

He walks over to the Giant climbs up his leg and sits on
his knee The Giant turns and looks at Hogarth with weary

eyes Hogarth sighs

HOGARTH
It wasnt your fault

No response from the Giant

HOGARTH
Things die Its part of life

Hogarth reaches for the overhanging branch of a nearby tree
and picks two leaves -- a brown on and a green one He holds

up the green leaf

HOGARTH (contd

Life
He holds up the brown leaf

HOGARTH (contd)
and death

He gestures at the forest around him

HOGARTH (contd)
theyre part of the way things are

He points at the Giant and shakes his head

HOGARTH (contd)
You didnt make it that way Do you
understand Its not your fault
The Giant gazes at Hogarth for a beat then takes the leaves
from the boys hands and studies them Hogarth hops down and
stands by Dean

DEAN
Whats he doing

HOGARTH
Hes thinking Its not an easy thing to
understand
Dean looks at Hogarth with empathy
INT THE ARMYS TEMPORARY COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Kent is on the phone with the chief Hes visably PALE

KENT
But Sir youre making a big mistake

The Chief SLAMS the receiver down so hard it hurts Kents
hand in Maine

EXT DEANS JUNKYARD - DAY

The Giant still ponders Just then a pair of Army planes
comes into view We hear a beeping sound

HOGARTH
Oh no

DEAN
What is it

The panels on the Giants arms slide open and the strange
tracking device pops out again

HOGARTH
I was going to tell you

The Giant looks confused as another panel opens and what
appears to be a rocket launcher pokes out tracking the
planes As they pass the weapons recede and the panels
close The Giant looks distressed
DEAN
Good God Hogarth hes armed How could
you keep this from me

HOGARTH
Would you have let him stay

DEAN
No

HOGARTH
Thats why

DEAN

Oh man Oh man Hogarth This is
serious What are we doing Hes not
some lost puppyhes a weapon

Dean is pointing at the Giant now Hogarth sees the Giant
watching Dean with eyes wide

HOGARTH
Dean shh--

DEAN
Hes a machine Hogarth He was made
designed--to kill
The Giant stands up He looks at himself and then at Dean
And then with a terrible roar he runs away Dean and

Hogarth share a look of panic

DEAN
This is bad

HOGARTH
We gotta find him

DEAN
Come on

They run for his house
EXT ROCKWELL - SAME TIME

Kent watches in despair as the ARMY pulls out of Rockwell
taking his credibility and hopes for the future with them

EXT COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

and depressed not knowing or caring where hes going

INT DEANS GARAGE

He wheels a motorcycle out Hogarth jumps in the sidecar
EXT THE DEEP WOODS - DAY
The Giant blindly marches on agitated grieving
EXT DEANS MOTORCYCLE - MOVING - DAY

Dean and Hogarth speed into the driving snow following the
Giants quickly filling footprints

DEAN
Hes headed right toward town

EXT THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - EVENING
FILLING THE SCREEN a woman SCREAMS LOUD

REVERSE the Giant peers down at a tiny woman her TINY
SCREAM barely heard from his viewpoint He waves meekly

BACK TO the woman SCREAMS runs in SLAMS the door
The Giant wonders He looks behind him is something back
there Nope He shrugs He wanders on the streets

largely deserted the snow falls heavily
LOOKING IN A SECOND-STORY WINDOW

A TODDLER watches a TV monster movie Bored he looks out
the window and sees a real monster He blinks isnt sure
whether to be scared or not

The Giant sees the kid staring at him The Giant smiles and
waves The kid grins waves back

The kid HOLLERS in silence TWO OLDER KIDS join him at the
window look out see a waving giant They look stunned and
wave back One YELLS a silent MOM

MOM appears at the window The Giant waves She turns
white SCREAMS silently YANKS down the window shade

The Giant blinks disturbed

BOW-WOW-WOW He looks down a tiny TERRIER BARKS ferociously
at him then NIPS at his foot and YELPS in pain

GIANT
Rock

The giant reaches down for the terrier it YIPES and runs
away The giant looks disappointed

He looks up nearby several VILLAGERS stand in the falling
snow staring up at him He waves

The villagers run inside SLAM their doors The giant MOANS
depressed
WITH DEAN AND HOGARTH - MOVING

In the snow Dean drives flat-out In the side-car Hogarth
hangs on for dear life They blow past--

KENT going the other way Kent SLAMS on his breaks his
suspicions aroused and hangs a U-TURN almost colliding wit
the last of the TROOPS Their truck screeches to a stop Ken
jumps out waving his arms as he runs up to the driver

KENT
STOP I know thisll sound crazy but--

THE MIDDLE OF TOWN

A scene out of a 50s horror movie a dozen VILLAGERS run
SCREAMING from a huge giant behind them

But this giant just stands there his shoulders droop
heartsick He realizes that everyone is terrified of him
and he doesnt understand why

If the Iron Giant could cry he would
SIRENS sound in the distance getting closer

The giant turns around and heads back out of town toward th
junkyard and home

SHREEEEEK Right in front of him A WOMAN SCREAMS her hand
fly up releasing her baby carriage which rolls right up
against the giants feet

The giant looks down sees an INFANT inside The baby COO
and waves at the giant who grins and waves back At last
friendly face

Two police cars SCREECH up TWO COPS leap out and fumble out
their guns The mother SCREAMS

MOTHER
Its got my baby
One cop RADIOS for help Annie exits the diner sees the

scene joins the crowd terrified watching

ascinated giant CHORTLES and leans way down to look closer

The cops stare stunned at the Giant towering over the baby

t the GIGGLING infant which looks threatening to onlookers
Alarmed the cops raise their guns Dean and Hogarth SCREECH
up on Deans motorcycle

HOGARTH
No

The cops FIRE The bullets bounce off the Giants sides
The Giant turns what was that His eyes zero in on the
cops guns--and turn BRIGHT RED With a heavy machinery
WHIRR

a FUTURISTIC WEAPON springs up out of the Giants right
arm which he instinctively swings toward the police car
Cops and soldiers leap aside as a GREEN RAY shoots and--

KA-THOOOOOOM

--the police car EXPLODES in an unearthly blast that sends a
blue fireball roiling into the sky The Giants arm jerks
round catching the helpless cops and soldiers in its cross-
hairs

but the Giants eyes suddenly clear alarmed he knocks
his arm aside before it FIRES KA-THOOOOOOM The RAY rips
through the air destroying a grove of trees on the far side
of town

The Giant RECOILS horrified by his own destructive power
He forces the gun back into his arm and rushes away
vanishing into the night

Dean and Hogarth exchange glances They turn to go and---

--run straight into KENT and a group of SOLDIERS Theyve
seen the whole thing and Kent has never looked more SMUG

KENT
(to soldiers)
Seize them

The soldiers do as theyre told grabbing Dean and Hogarth
HOGARTH

Hey Get your hands off Let go of me

Youre hurting me Help
As they pass through frame we see that KENT is holding a
MICROPHONE and recording Hogarths protestations on a tape
recorder He SMILES
EXT FOREST - DUSK

The Giant hides anxious and watchful Then he hears a
distant sound echoing through the trees a voice

HOGARTH
Let go of me Youre hurting me Help
Thats all the Giant needs to hear Hes off moving
swiftly through the dark forest in the sounds direction

EXT ROCKWELL - DUSK

The Giant moves to the edge of the forest and pauses
distrustfully The town is oddly still

Hogarths voice can still be heard calling for help Then the
Giant spies--

HOGARTH-- gagged and tied to the top of a radio tower on the
roof of the five story Cross building the tallest in
Rockwell He squirms

The moment the Giant starts to move toward the building the
Army (camouflaged) OPENS FIRE Suddenly the Giant is being
hit from all sides (rifles machine guns bazookas) ARMOR
(which we havent seen before) slides out of his body and
locks into a covering around him

A stray shot takes out of chunk of the base of the tower that
Hogarth is tied to and it starts to TOPPLE

The Giant SEES THIS and rushes directly into the line of fire
to SHIELD Hogarth from being crushed by the tower The Giant
pulls the tower loose sliding Hogarth into his metal hand

GENERAL
Hes got the boy HOLD YOUR FIRE
KENT
Its KILLED the boy Dont let it get
away
A wall of artillery closes the entrance to town and begins

to fire away at Giant The Giant looks toward the sea--but
sees armed ships out there their guns pointed toward land

Once again various weapons begin to pop out of the Giants
arms He presses them back in He turns and RUNS straight at
the wall of Artillery And JUMPS OVER IT

Everyone stares gape-jawed then quickly tries to swivel
their guns in the opposite direction But the GIANT is
already GONE The general calls to the AIR FORCE

GENERAL
This is General Rogard Code red
Repeat-- code red

COUNTRYSIDE - MOVING WITH THE GIANT
The Giant carrying Hogarth hustles through the snow

slipping occassionally but moving with surprising swiftness
Behind them JET FIGHTERS appear on the far horizon
And in a moment theyre on top of them strafing the ground
with machine gun fire launching rockets etc

The Giant bursts through the trees and suddenly finds
himself on a two-lane highway--about to step on cars and the
terrified people driving them

The Giant SIDESTEPS to avoid them losing his balance at full
run and SLAMMING into the snowy ground --SLIDING thunderously
for the better part of a mile and cutting a very large swath
through whatever happens to be in the way

EXT ROCKWELL STREET - DAY
Annie struggles with two Agents who hustle her into a car

ANNIE
Let me go I have to get to my son What
is going on

AGENT 1
Im afraid thats classified maam

ANNIE
Classified What do you mean

She tries the door It wont open She pounds on the window

ANNIE
Open this door Hey

And then she notices that shes not alone in the car Beside
her is Dean who sits with his head in his hands

EXT COUNTRYSIDE

The Giant tries to swat at the fighter planes as they fly
overhead but they are just out of his reach He grabs a
fallen tree swinging it like a club clipping off most of
one fighters WINGS The pilot EJECTS just before the jet
plows into the earth bursting into a fireball

More and more fighters appear --too many-- BLASTING away at
the Giant He veers toward a high cliff--and JUMPS---

--INTO THE SEA

UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Imagine a five story building smashing into the sea and you
might conjure the explosion of bubbles caused by the Giant
only moments before the fighters swoop the waters surface
strafing it with machine gun fire The bullets pull-up short
impotently The Giant feels safe Then he looks to his hand--

Hogarth is drowning

The Giant is stuck he cant surface because of the jets but
he cant let Hogarth drown He reaches up with his other
hand cupping it above the waters surface and pulls it down
below allowing Hogarth to breathe in the pocket of air

Just then-- A SUB catch the Giant in their sights They
launch torpedoes The Giant dodges them but they explode
into the base of the cliffs not far away--causing an
avalanche of rock to splash into the ocean--which the Giant
has to dodge while still holding Hogarth in his pocket of
air

More ships appear and they launch DEPTH CHARGES which
explode around the fleeing giant convincing him hed best

take his chances above water

INT AGENTS CAR

Annie stares out the window Dean slumps in his seat

DEAN
Its my fault I shouldve done
something something different

ANNIE
I know the feeling

DEAN
I just thought the kid could use a
friend

ANNIE

You were right Dean You were right
THE CLIFFS

With great difficulty the Iron Giant climbs the rocky
crumbling cliff face one-handed as the military keeps the
heat on Finally unable to find purchase on the cliff face
the Giant stays on a small outcropping turning to face the
onslaught

Military helicopters descend into view shining blindingly
bright spotlights on the Giant who is now showing a lot of
wear and tear

Weapons break out like hives all over the Giants body its
clear that the Army is about to get the worst end of the
deal

CLOSE - THE GIANTS FACE

Something changes in the Giant he WILLS the weapons to
retreat back into his body and--haltingly--they Do

INSIDE CHOPPER
The pilot trains his weapons on the Giant and shouts into his
radio

PILOT
We have him in our sights sir
EXT TOWN STREET
Kent is rabid
KENT
(to General)
Whatre you waiting for FIRE
THE CLIFF FACE
The Giant turns-- but hes surrounded It looks bad Then

a low RUMBLING SOUND BEGINS and BUILDS to a ROAR

HOGARTH
Whats happening

THE GIANT
(PUZZLED SOUND)

Both look down the Giants feet begin to flame like rockets
as he BLASTS OFF INTO THE NIGHT Sky

EXT THE GIANT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR - NIGHT

The Giant and HOGARTH are FLYING kind of They BLAST
along out of control the Giants arms flailing

HOGARTH
Steer that way

THE GIANT
(MORE PUZZLED SOUNDS)

HOGARTH
I dont know Point your arms maybe--
like Superman

The Giant does as hes told and they fly (more or less) in
that direction The Giant grins

HOGARTH
OK Now land
(Giant looks blank)
Uh drop your arms

The Giant lowers his arms to his sides and the ROCKETS
SPUTTER out The two PLUMMET to the ground KA-THUMP
EXT THE WOODS - DAY

HOGARTH and the Giant dazed from their landing collect
their wits And here come the spotter planes

EXT CLIFF - DAY

Hogarth and the Giant stand together and watch the Army
close in

HOGARTH
Its no good Theres too many of them
Well never get away

He sits down in despair The Giant sits down too
HOGARTH
Theyre going to take you away Giant

Theres nothing we can do

For a long moment they sit in silence Finally the Giant
speaks

GIANT
Rock
HOGARTH
(Looks up)
Huh
GIANT

Hogarth smiles

HOGARTH

GIANT

GIANT

HOGARTH

GIANT

HOGARTH
(tearfully)
I know Weve been through a lot
together havent we

He puts his hand in the Giants hand

HOGARTH (contd)
Im going to miss you so much

SUBMARINE PERISCOPE POV

Through a long periscope lens as the sub rounds the point
we see the cliff and the Giant come into view

INT SUBMARINE
The first mate looks up from the periscope--

FIRST MATE
Ive got a visual on the monster sir

CAPTAIN
Do we have a clear shot

FIRST MATE
Not yet sir

CAPTAIN
Get closer Dont surface until the last
minute

INT NAVAL CRUISER - BRIDGE - SAME TIME

SPOTTER
Monster sighted off the port bow

CAPTAIN
Well only get one shot Full speed
ahead

UNDERWATER - THE BAY - CONTINUOUS

The sub begins to RISE to the surface unaware that the
cruiser is speeding toward the same position

The cruiser SWERVES to avoid collision but its too late
the cruiser CLIPS the submarine aft causing a fatal BREACH
that splits the sub

INSIDE THE SUB

CHAOS The ocean RUSHES IN as electricity ARCS up the
severed wiring of the subs MISSLE SYSTEM It FIRES--

EXT ROCKWELL - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

THREE POLARIS MISSILES break the water surface one of which
sports a large GASH in its side its circuitry sparking
clearly malfunctioning Their second stage rockets fire
causing several clusters of townsfolk to turn to watch
mouths agape as the missiles climb up into the night sky

EXT CLIFF - DAY
Hogarth and the Giant watch the missiles streak into the sky

HOGARTH
Whats happening--

Hogarth looks out at the sea On the decks of one of the
warships he can see people panicking

HOGARTH
There must be some mistake

He looks up at the sky again A look of fear comes over him
He begins to pace

HOGARTH
Oh no oh no

In his voice is a note of desperation weve never heard
before The Giant seems to notice He looks at Hogarth
puzzled trying to understand Hogarth points at the sky

HOGARTH
The missiles Missiles Theyre nuclear
Nu-cle-ar When they come down

He mimes a missile coming down and exploding

HOGARTH (contd)
Death

The Giant reacts Hogarth gestures at the town around him

HOGARTH
everything

The Giant looks at the sky then at the town and after a
moment back at Hogarth He picks up two leaves one green
and one brown

He gives Hogarth the green leaf keeping the brown one for
himself

HOGARTH
What What do you mean I dont
understand

The Giant looks at Hogarth gently touching the side of his
face with a massive finger And with that the Giant blasts
off into the sky Hogarth looks at his leaf again anda
look of dawning comprehension comes over him
EXT SPACE - UPPER ATMOSPHERE OVER EASTERN US COAST

The Giant BLASTS ALONG at full power to catch up His radar
tracking the giant spots the missiles Suddenly TWO of the
missles rockets fire sending them off toward separate
targets on the earths surface

-while the DAMAGED MISSLE just FIZZLES and slowly starts
to drop straight down toward Maine far below

INT AGENTS CAR
Annie and Dean look out the back window

ANNIE
What is it

DEAN
Polaris missile I think

ANNIE
Shouldnt we get to a shelter

DEAN
It wouldnt matter

They look at each for a long silent beat Then he reaches
out and takes her hand

EXT ROCKWELL

A deathly HUSH has fallen over all assembled Kent looking
ASHEN starts slowly backing toward the jeep and escape
Without turning around the General barks loudly at Kent

GENERAL
This is your party Mansley Dont even
think about leaving early Lieutenant

The Lieutenant pulls his sidearm and levels it at Kent Kent
WINCES caught

EXT SPACE - UPPER ATMOSPHERE

The Giant takes off after the first missile He concentrates
and the panel on his arm opens up revealing the now familiar
weapon He FIRES at the distant glare of the missile rockets

igniting the warhead on the second shot There is a
blinding FLASH followed by a shockwave but the Giant
remains intact

He doubles back in pursuit of the second missle Sighting
it he FIRES --and MISSES repeatedly losing valuable time as
he moves closer and closer to the missile

Finally he hits it It EXPLODES too near him pummeling him
throwing him back The Giant recovers and tries to shoot the
remaining missile
EXT CLIFF

Several jeeps pull up beside Hogarth who is staring at the
sky The General and a group of soldiers jump out Kent
flanked by soldiers with pistols on him sits silently in the
back of the jeep The Captain scoops up Hogarth in his arms
and stares at the sky as well

IN SPACE - ABOVE THE ATLANTIC OCEAN
The Giant spots the third missile arcing down toward Maine
and his beloved Rockwell He CUTS IN HIS AFTERBURNERS zooms

toward it

The giant catches up to the third missile but his weapons
are CHARRED unable to fire Theres only one option left

WITH THE GIANT

The ROAR of his engines fades into silence as a look of peace
falls over his iron face He wraps his arms around the nose
of the missile closing his eyes

and slams his fist into the tip of the bomb--
FROM EARTH
The blackness of the night sky goes brilliant WHITE

EXT ROCKWELL - NIGHT

Lining the streets the town people see the brilliant white
sky darken turn back into night as one the crowd CHEERS

EXT OUTER SPACE OVER ASIA - NIGHT

Pieces of the giant rain all over the Eastern Hemisphere in
a spectacular display

EXT CLIFF
The General gets the word over his headset

GENERAL

The soldiers cheer The General approaches Kent still
flanked by military officers

GENERAL
As you for you Mansley Youre under
arrest and all that that implies

Kent visably WITHERS
HOGARTH
But the giant

The General looks at Hogarth with great sadness and shakes
his head Hogarth hides his face and SOBS

The CHEERS TRAIL OFF as the soldiers realize the great
sacrifice that the big metal monster has made for them and

mankind The General looks at his men

GENERAL
Lets go home

The General carries Hogarth to the Jeep Hogarth stares at
the GREEN LEAF in his hand We CLOSE ON on the leaf and

MATCH CUT TO
THE SAME LEAF
It is now brown We pull out to reveal that were in
HOGARTHS BEDROOM
Where the leaf sits on Hogarths bookshelf beside the picture
of his father We pan out the window to Rockwell itself
Its springtime And everything old is new again
EXT ROCKWELL STREETS - DAY
Dean and Annie walk hand in hand with Hogarth alongside
Everyone smiles and waves All three are now celebrities
and even Dean seems well-liked and respected

The busybodies spot the trio and whisper to each other

MYRTLE
Why dont they make a lovely family

Dean and Annie exchange a smile This time Hogarth smiles
and nods too Then something on the ground catches his eye

A scorched piece of iron

Hogarth picks it up examines it a bittersweet expression on
his face Hogarth carefully puts the piece in his pocket
and looks up into the sky

EXT NORTHERN INDIA - NIGHT

A lonely kid from India SASHI a tinkerer sits in his room
working on an electronics project Its a poor but well-kept
home Out a window a METEOR plows into their field KABOOM

THE METEOR CRATER

Ropes lead down into the crater PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sashi
has an elephant pulling out the meteor

SASHI
Pull

The elephant strains pulls its the head of the Giant The
boy leaps into the air shouting overjoyed

In an India-version of Hogarths barn Sashi cleans the giant
head But it looks dead

INDIA MOTHER

SHASI
Coming
Sashi walks out then CRACKLE Lights flicker in the
Giants eyes and the eyes light up

The Giant looks around comes to his senses sees his
predicament and the antenna rises up out of his head

ANGLES ALL OVER THE WORLD

--giant parts wherever theyve fallen suddenly snap to
attention

Several NUTS and BOLTS dig themselves up out of sand The
pieces start hopping away

Part of a FINGER surfaces in the sea and WORMS toward shore

A sign by an ocean liner reads India Several parts sneak
up the gangplank

INT HOGARTHS ROOM - NIGHT

Hogarth is awakened by a RATTLING SOUND He looks to see the

scorched PIECE OF IRON on his dresser as it drops to the

floor and starts moving toward his window Hogarth BEAMS
and opens his window to release it MUSIC SOARS as the

boy watches the piece of metal GO his mind swimming with new

possibilities

ABOVE THE PLANET

The Giants scorched HAND orbits listlessly Suddenly it

WAKENS and slowly turns away from us Burning as it hits

the atmosphere the hand reaches toward earth

FADE EVERYTHING TO BLACK except the tiny flaming dot
THE END
