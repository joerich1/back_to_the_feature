WIND

And under the wind the distant tolling of a bell With the
tolling a single word fades up

WHEN

And repeats twice more

WHEN

WHEN

As the last When appears we hear the voices of three
women alternating

(VO)
When shall we three meet again
In thunder lightning or in rain
When the hurly-burlys done
When the battles lost and won
That will be ere the set of sun
Where the place
Upon the heath
There to meet with Macbeth

ALL TOGETHER
Fair is foul and foul is fair
Hover through the fog and filthy air

1 MILKY WHITE — DAY

FADE UP with music on a theatre curtain It opens slowly to
reveal nothing but milky white from floor to ceiling

From the top of the frame a small black spot descends and
starts to describe a circle in the white field It looks
like a far-away bird arcing down from above

As the bird completes a circle the white fog behind it
slowly blows away to reveal even tinier what appears to
be a man defying gravity walking up the far wall at the
back of the stage

We realize we are looking down from above

trail of blood He walks with difficulty as he looks from
the tents up into the sky overhead

HIS POV—Against a background of painted clouds a raven
circles overhead waiting for him to die It is joined by
two others

MALCOLM (OFF)
Hail brave friend

3 EXT DUNCANS ENCAMPMENT

PUSH IN on Malcolm standing in the encampment next to
Duncan the King

MALCOLM (CONT’D)
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it

CAPTAIN
Doubtful it stood
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art The merciless MacDonwald --
With fortune on his damnéd quarrel smiling
Showed like a rebels whore But alls too weak
For Brave Macbeth—well he deserves that name --
Disdaining fortune with his brandished steel
Which smoked with bloody execution
Like valors minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave
Which neer shook hands nor bade farewell to him
Till he unseamed him from the knave to the chops
And fixed his head upon our battlements

DUNCAN
O valiant cousin worthy gentleman

Behind Malcolm and Duncan warriors are gathering

CAPTAIN
No sooner justice had with valor armed
Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels
But the Norwegian lord surveying vantage
With furbished arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault
BLUE REVISED — 11620

DUNCAN
Dismayed not this
Our captains Macbeth and Banquo

CAPTAIN
Yes
As Sparrows eagles or the hare the lion
So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe
I cannot tell-

The Captain sinks to his knees Behind him we see Ross and
a soldier approaching

CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
But I am faint my gashes cry for help

As he is assisted off Ross walks into a CLOSE UP

ROSS
God save the King

DUNCAN
Whence camst thou worthy Thane

ROSS
From Fife great King
Where the Norwegian banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold
Norway himself with terrible numbers
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The Thane of Cawdor began a dismal conflict
Till that Bellonas bridegroom brave Macbeth
Confronted him with self-comparisons
Point against point rebellious arm gainst arm
Curbing his lavish spirit and to conclude
The victory fell to us

MALCOLM
Great happiness

DUNCAN
No more the Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest Go pronounce his present death--

Ill see it done--
DUNCAN

Duncan and Malcolm turn walk away towards the tents and
are swallowed by the fog

4 EXT THE BEACHBATTLEFIELD 4

A corpse littered beach—the bodies of Norwegian soldiers
half buried in the sand The first Witch starts to rummage
a body his eyes pecked out as if by a bird

FIRST WITCH
Where hast thou been sister

SECOND WITCH
Killing swine

FIRST WITCH
Sister where thou

THIRD WITCH

(finding the thumb)
Look what I have

SECOND WITCH
Show me Show me
THIRD WITCH

Here I have a sailor’s thumb
Wrecked as homeward he did come

SECOND WITCH
A drum a drum
Macbeth doth come

FIRST WITCH
O In a sieve I’1l thither sail
And like a rat without a tail
I’1l do I’11 do I’11 do

SECOND WITCH
I’ll give thee a wind

FIRST WITCH
Thou’rt kind
BLUE REVISED — 11620

THIRD WITCH
And I another

FIRST WITCH
I myself have all the other
I’1ll drain him dry as hay
Sleep shall neither night nor day
Hang upon his penthouse lid
He shall live a man forbid
Weary sev’nights nine times nine
Shall he dwindle peak and pine

ALL TOGETHER
The weird sisters hand in hand
Posters of the sea and land
Thus do go about about
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
And thrice again to make up nine
Peace the charms wound up

Distantly off

MACBETH
So foul and fair a day I have not seen

SLOW PUSH IN on the Three Witches They freeze standing
together waiting for Macbeth to emerge from the fog

BANQUO (OFF)
How far is it to Forres

As Banquo and Macbeth approach

BANQUO (CONTD)
What are these
So withered and so wild in their attire
That look not like the inhabitants o’ th’ earth
And yet are on ‘t Live you or are you aught
That man may question

MACBETH
Speak if you can What are you

We hear the screech of a bird—then finding her voice

FIRST WITCH
All hail Macbeth Hail to thee Thane of Glamis
BLUE REVISED — 11620

SECOND WITCH
All hail Macbeth Hail to thee Thane of Cawdor

THIRD WITCH
All hail Macbeth that shall be king hereafter

BANQUO (TO MACBETH)
Good sir why do you start and seem to fear
Things that do sound so fair (to the witches)
If you can look into the seeds of time
And say which grain will grow and which will not
Speak then to me who neither beg nor fear
Your favors nor your hate

Three screeches

FIRST WITCH
Lesser than Macbeth and greater

SECOND WITCH
Not so happy yet much happier

THIRD WITCH
Thou shalt get kings though thou be none
So all hail Macbeth and Banquo
Banquo and Macbeth all hail

Macbeth advances as the witches back away into the fog

MACBETH
Stay you imperfect speakers tell me more
I know I am Thane of Glamis
But how of Cawdor The Thane of Cawdor lives
A prosperous gentleman and to be king
Stands not within the prospect of belief
No more than to be Cawdor Say from whence
You owe this strange intelligence or why
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
With such prophetic greeting Speak I charge you

BANQUO
The earth hath bubbles as the water has
And they are of them Wither are they vanished

Turning from the wall of fog to Banquo
BLUE REVISED — 11620 7

MACBETH
Into the air and what seemed corporal melted
As breath into the wind Would they had stayed

With a SCREECH three black birds burst from the fog behind
Macbeth and rocket overhead flapping their wings Macbeth
ducks as Banquo pivots to watch them fly away

BANQUO
Were such things here as we do speak about
Or have we eaten on the insane root
That takes the reason prisoner

Macbeth laughing

MACBETH
Your children shall be kings

BANQUO
You shall be king

MACBETH
And Thane of Cawdor too Went it not so

Looking apprehensively into the sky

BANQUO
To th’ selfsame tune and words

FADE OUT

We hear the rhythmic spattering of rain on canvas and the
distant rumble of thunder The thunder turns into the
ominous rumble of horse’s hooves approaching

OVER BLACK a title FADES UP

THE TRAGEDY OF MACBETH

We hear a voice

Who goes there

5 INTEXT MACBETH’S TENT ENCAMPENT — NIGHT

CLOSE ON MACBETH’S EYES startled open from sleep
BLUE REVISED — 11620

Standing over Macbeth are Ross and Angus under lit by
firelight We are inside a canvas tent

ROSS
The king hath happily received Macbeth
The news of thy success and when he reads
Thy personal venture in the rebels’ fight
His wonders and his praises do contend
Which should be thine or his

ANGUS
We are sent
To give thee from our royal master thanks
Only to herald thee into his sight
Not pay thee

Macbeth struggles up from his pallet onto his elbows
Banquo waits in a far corner of the tent

ROSS
And for an earnest of a greater honor
He bade me from him call thee Thane of Cawdor
In which addition hail most worthy thane
For it is thine

BANQUO
What can the devil speak true

MACBETH
The Thane of Cawdor lives Why do you dress me
In borrowed robes

ROSS
Who was the thane lives yet

He indicates the open entrance to the tent Outside under
guard THE THANE OF CAWDOR kneels outside

ROSS (CONTD)
But under heavy judgment bears that life
Which he deserves to lose

Ross and Angus start to withdraw from the tent

ROSS (CONTD)

Whether he was combined

With those of Norway or did line the rebel
(MORE )
BLUE REVISED — 11620 9

ROSS (CONTD)
With hidden help and vantage or that with both
He labored in his country’s wrack I know not

Still speaking as he approaches the prisoner Ross
unscabards his sword

ROSS (CONT’D)
But treasons capital confessed and proved
Have overthrown him

Macbeth has approached the entrance to the tent to peer
out

Ross has raised his sword over the prisoner—but pauses He
turns toward the tent Cradling the blade he offers it to
Macbeth

MACBETH
(Letting the tent flap down)
Thanks for your pains

Then under his breath

MACBETH (CONT’D)
Glamis and Thane of Cawdor—
The greatest is behind

He turns to Banquo After a pause

MACBETH (CONT’D)
Do you not hope your children shall be kings
When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me
Promised no less to them

BANQUO

(making his way out)
That trusted home
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown
Besides the Thane of Cawdor But ‘tis strange
And oftentimes to win us to our harm
The instruments of darkness tell us truths
Win us with honest trifles to betray’s
In deepest consequence

Banquo leaves Alone now
BLUE REVISED — 11620 10

MACBETH
This supernatural soliciting
Cannot be ill cannot be good If ill
Why hath it given me earnest of success
Commencing in a truth

Crossing the tent to sit at a small camp table

MACBETH (CONT’D)

I am Thane of Cawdor
If good why do I yield to that suggestion
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs
Against the use of nature Present fears
Are less than horrible imaginings
My thought whose murder yet is but fantastical
Shakes so my single state of man that function
Is smothered in surmise and nothing is
But what is not

His attention is taken by a scuffle and raised voices
outside

MACBETH (CONT’D)
If chance will have me king why chance may crown me
Without my stir

And then reaches for a piece of rolled paper and a quill
pen The wind returns rattling the canvas of the tent all
around him like a different kind of thunder

MACBETH (CONT’D)
Come what come may
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day

CLOSE on his hand as he unrolls the paper and we move in to
its blank whiteness filling the screen The white
parchment dissolves to the texture of a white wall
Once more the distant tolling of a bell then a woman’s
voice
LADY MACBETH
They met me in the day of success and I have learned
by the perfect’st report they have more in them than
mortal knowledge
BLUE REVISED — 11620 11

6 INT INVERNESS - LADY MACBETH’S HALL AND BEDCHAMBER — NIGHT 6

A dark shadow of a woman walking holding a piece of
paper enters from the right crossing the wall

We PAN off the wall into blackness to discover LADY MACBETH
emerging from the shadows reading from the parchment that
she holds in her hand

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
“When I burned in desire to question them further they
made themselves air into which they vanished Whiles I
stood rapt in the wonder of it came missives from the
king who all-hailed me Thane of Cawdor by which title
before these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to
the coming on of time with ‘Hail king that shalt be’ This
have I thought good to deliver thee my dearest partner of
greatness that thou might’st not lose the dues of
rejoicing by being ignorant of what greatness is promised
thee Lay it to thy heart and farewell”

She walks to a candle and dips the corner of the letter
into the flame

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
Glamis thou art and Cawdor and shalt be
What thou art promised Yet do I fear thy nature
It is too full o’ th’ milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way

She walks towards the door to the balcony as the flame
slowly curls up the parchment underlighting her face and
leaving a translucent ash

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
Thou wouldst be great
Art not without ambition but without
The illness should attend it What thou wouldst highly
That wouldst thou holily wouldst not play false
And yet wouldst wrongly win

CLOSE on Lady Macbeth on the balcony now lit by the moon
Her prospect shows only the heath far below us and the
stars

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
Hie thee hither

That I may pour my spirits in thine ear
And chastise with the valor of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round

Behind her across the room we see a door open and she is

backlit

by a shaft of light

CLOSE ON THE CANDLE

A draft of air from the open door carries the flaming

letter into the wind

THE ROYAL ENCAMPMENT

CLOSE ON ROSS CONFERRING WITH MALCOLM

Malcolm

breaks off and approaches the king

MALCOLM
My liege I have spoke

With one that saw him die who did report
That very frankly he confessed his treasons
Implored your highness’ pardon and set forth
A deep repentance

Ross steps up behind Malcolm to complete the thought

ROSS
Nothing in his life

Became him like the leaving it He died

As
To
As

one that had been studied in his death
throw away the dearest thing he owed
‘twere a careless trifle

KING DUNCAN
(studying Ross)

There’s no art
find the mind’s construction in the face
was a gentleman on whom I built
absolute trust
BLUE REVISED — 11620 13

His attention is drawn to Macbeth and Banquo who approach
and kneel

KING DUNCAN
O worthiest cousin
The sin of my ingratitude even now
Was heavy on me Only I have left to say
More is thy due than more than all can pay

MACBETH
The service and the loyalty I owe
In doing it pays itself

KING DUNCAN
Welcome hither
I have begun to plant thee and will labor
To make thee full of growing

He gestures for them to rise

KING DUNCAN (CONT’D)
Noble Banquo
That hast no less deserved nor must be known
No less to have done so let me enfold thee
And hold thee to my heart

BANQUO
There if I grow
The harvest is your own

KING DUNCAN
My plenteous joys
Wanton in fullness seek to hide themselves
In drops of sorrow

Gesturing for the assembled troops to approach he draws
Malcolm close to him

KING DUNCAN (CONTD)
Sons kinsmen thanes
And you whose places are the nearest know
We will establish our estate upon
Our eldest Malcolm whom we name hereafter
The Prince of Cumberland

This surprises Macbeth
BLUE REVISED — 11620 14

KING DUNCAN (CONTD)
Which honor must
Not unaccompanied invest him only
But signs of nobleness like stars shall shine
On all deservers

Turning to Macbeth

KING DUNCAN (CONT’D)
From hence to Inverness
And bind us further to you

Surprised again

MACBETH
Ill be myself the harbinger and make joyful
The hearing of my wife with your approach

Backing away

MACBETH (CONT’D)
So humbly take my leave

He turns to leave and we PULL him as he walks away from the
encampment

KING DUNCAN
My worthy Cawdor Let’s after him
whose care is gone before to bid us welcome
It is a peerless kinsman

MACBETH
The Prince of Cumberland—that is a step
On which I must fall down or else o’erleap
For in my way it lies
Stars hide your fires
Let not light see my black and deep desires

8 INT INVERNESS - LADY MACBETH’S BEDCHAMBER — NIGHT 8

Lady Macbeth just as we left her turns from the balcony
toward the open door behind her—the blown out candle still
in her hand Lady Macbeth’s Gentlewoman Lady Vivian
stands in the doorway

LADY MACBETH
What is your tidings

LADY VIVIAN
The king comes here tonight

LADY MACBETH
Thou’rt mad to say it
Is not thy master with him who were’t so
Would have informed for preparation

LADY VIVIAN
So please you it is true Our thane is coming
One of my fellows had the speed of him
Who almost dead for breath had scarcely more
Than would make up his message

LADY MACBETH
Give him tending
He brings great news

She shuts the door and leans against it looking across the
room at the balcony With a distant CRY a black bird flies
across the opening and disappears in the moonlit clouds

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements

She crosses the room into the moonlight and sits on the
bed

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)

Come you spirits
That tend on mortal thoughts unsex me here
And fill me from the crown to the toe topfull
Of direst cruelty Make thick my blood
Stop up th’ access and passage to remorse
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between
Th’ effect and it

BLUE REVISED — 11620 16

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
Come to my woman’s breasts
And take my milk for gall you murd’ring ministers
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature’s mischief Come thick night
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell

We move in to CLOSE on her eyes as they slowly close

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark
To cry “Hold hold”

9 INT INVERNESS - LADY MACBETH’S BEDCHAMBER — DAY

CLOSE on Lady Macbeth as she slowly opens her eyes in the
dark room

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK OVER the shoulder of Macbeth who
sits on the bed leaning over her For a long moment she
simply looks up at him

LADY MACBETH
(softly)
Great Glamis worthy Cawdor
Greater than both by the all-hail hereafter

Macbeth draws her up into an embrace and we hold on her
face over his shoulder

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present and I feel now
The future in the instant
BLUE REVISED — 11620

MACBETH
My dearest love
Duncan comes here tonight

LADY MACBETH
And when goes hence

MACBETH
Tomorrow as he purposes

LADY MACBETH
O never
Shall sun that morrow see
Your face my thane is as a book where men
May read strange matters To beguile the time
Look like the time bear welcome in your eye

Your hand your tongue look like th’ innocent flower

But be the serpent under’t

She rises from the bed and starts to unstrap his armor
gently drawing it off his body

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
He that’s coming
Must be provided for and you shall put
This night’s great business into my dispatch
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom

MACBETH
We will speak further

LADY MACBETH
Only look up clear
To alter favor ever is to fear
Leave all the rest to me

FADE OUT

We hear a bell begins to toll Beating wings and the cry of

birds

EXT INVERNESS - LADY MACBETH’S BEDCHAMBER WINDOW

FADE IN on LADY MACBETH through a window looking down
into the courtyard from a high vantage Reflected in the
window we see a flock of birds lifting off a bell tower in
the center of the courtyard

EXT INVERNESS - COURTYARD — DUSK

We are BOOMING DOWN from the high angle perspective of the
window toward the bell tower where Duncan and Banquo are
just dismounting from their horses

KING DUNCAN
This castle hath a pleasant seat

CLOSE ON DUNCAN looking up at the sky

KING DUNCAN (CONTD)
The air
Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
Unto our gentle senses

The birds settle on the tower as Duncan continues

KING DUNCAN (CONTD)
This guest of summer
The temple haunting martlet does approve
By his loved mansionry that the heavens breath
Smells wooingly here

No jutty frieze
Buttress nor coign of vantage but this bird
Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle
Where they most breed and haunt I have observed
The air is delicate

Lady Macbeth approaches across the courtyard

KING DUNCAN
See see our honored hostess

LADY MACBETH
All our service
In every point twice done and then done double
Were poor and single business to contend
Against those honors deep and broad wherewith
Your majesty loads our house

KING DUNCAN
Wheres the Thane of Cawdor
We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose
To be his purveyor

We see the group now from a distance over the shoulder of
Macbeth He is watching them from a dark corner of the
colonnade

KING DUNCAN (CONT’D)
but he rides well
And his great love sharp as his spur hath helped him
To his home before us

CLOSE on MACBETH watching Duncan BANQUO AND LADY MACBETH
withdraw toward the castle

KING DUNCAN (CONTD)

We are your guest tonight
Give me your hand
Conduct me to mine host

enters and he grasps it

EXT INVERNESS-COURTYARD BELLTOWER — NIGHT 14

He opens them from fists to palm Hard and calloused but
scrubbed clean Distant music has faded up with the sound
of merrymaking He is standing where we left him but it is
now night A light from a distant window fades up on his
face and shadows move across it

MACBETH (CONT’D)

If th’ assassination
Could trammel up the consequence and catch
With his surcease success that but this blow
Might be the be-all and the end-all — here
But here upon this bank and shoal of time
Wed jump the life to come

He stands in the dark in the courtyard outside the banquet
hall—For the first time we see him not in his armor but in
a tunic He turns toward the music and the distant window
and we follow him as he approaches it

MACBETH (CONT’D)

But in these cases
We still have judgment here that we but teach
Bloody instructions which being taught return
To plague th’ inventor This evenhanded justice
Commends th’ ingredience of our poisoned chalice
To our own lips He’s here in double trust
First as I am his kinsman and his subject
Strong both against the deed then as his host
Who should against his murderer shut the door
Not bear the knife myself

Through the window we see dark shapes in silhouette
projected and distorted on the imperfect glass

MACBETH (CONT’D)

Besides this Duncan
Hath borne his faculties so meek hath been
So clear in his great office that his virtues
Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against
The deep damnation of his taking-off

CLOSE ON MACBETH

Shadows cross his face cast from the merrymakers inside
the banquet hall passing to-and-fro across the window
BLUE REVISED — 11620

MACBETH (CONT’D)
And pity like a naked newborn babe
Striding the blast or heaven’s cherubim horsed
Upon the sightless couriers of the air
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye
That tears shall drown the wind

Behind him we see a dark form approaching from deeper in
the courtyard

MACBETH (CONT’D)
I have no spur
To prick the sides of my intent but only
Vaulting ambition which o’erleaps itself
And falls on th’ other—

Lady Macbeth touching his shoulder and he turns to face
her

MACBETH
How now What news

LADY MACBETH
He has almost supped

MACBETH
Hath he asked for me

LADY MACBETH
Know you not he has

MACBETH
We will proceed no further in this business
He hath honored me of late and I have bought
Golden opinions from all sorts of people
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss
Not cast aside so soon

She draws him away from the window into a darker corner of
the courtyard into the shadows of the bell tower

BLUE REVISED — 11620

LADY MACBETH
Was the hope drunk
Wherein you dressed yourself Hath it slept sinc
And wakes it now to look so green and pale
At what it did so freely From this time
Such I account thy love Art thou afeard
To be the same in thine own act and valor
As thou art in desire Wouldst thou have that
Which thou esteem’st the ornament of life
And live a coward in thine own esteem
Letting “I dare not” wait upon “I would”
Like the poor cat I’ th’ adage

MACBETH
Prithee peace
I dare do all that may become a man
Who dares do more is none

LADY MACBETH
What beast was’t then
That made you break this enterprise to me
When you durst do it then you were a man
And to be more than what you were you would
Be so much more the man I have given suck and
How tender ‘tis to love the babe that milks me
I would while it was smiling in my face
Have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums
And dashed the brains out had I so sworn as you
Have done to this

MACBETH
If we should fail

LADY MACBETH
We fail
But screw your courage to the sticking place
And we’1ll not fail When Duncan is asleep
Whereto the rather shall his day’s hard journey
Soundly invite him his two chamberlains
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
That memory the warder of the brain
Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason
A limbeck only When in swinish sleep
Their drenched natures lies as in a death
What cannot you and I perform upon
Th’ unguarded Duncan what not put upon
His spongy officers who shall bear the guilt
Of our great quell

Macbeth looks at her for a long beat The distant music
stops and it is quiet

MACBETH
Bring forth men-children only
For thy undaunted mettle should’ve composed
Nothing but males

Lady Macbeth returns his stare but is silent

MACBETH (CONT’D)
Will it not be received
When we have marked with blood those sleepy two
Of his own chamber and used their very daggers
That they have done’t

LADY MACBETH
Who dares receive it other
As we shall make our griefs and clamor roar
Upon his death

MACBETH
I am settled and bend up
Each corporal agent to this terrible feat
Away and mock the time with fairest show
False face must hide what the false heart doth know

Lady Macbeth’s footsteps echoing away The light from the
distant window behind him fades out leaving him standing
alone in a shaft of moonlight

EXT INVERNESS - COURTYARD — STILL NIGHT
From a distant corner of the courtyard A VOICE

BANQUO
How goes the night boy

MACBETH turns his attention to the voices Fleance
Banquo’s son is entering through the gate followed by his

father MACBETH backs into the shadow of the bell tower to

listen but not be seen

BLUE REVISED — 11620 24

CLOSE ON FLEANCE We are still in the courtyard but all is
quiet now Beyond the boy Banquo approaches

FLEANCE
The moon is down I have not heard the clock

BANQUO
And she goes down at twelve

FLEANCE
I take’t ‘tis later sir

BANQUO
Hold take my sword There’s husbandry in heaven
Their candles are all out Take thee that too
A heavy summons lies like lead upon me
And yet I would not sleep

MACBETH turns hearing footsteps approach from the opposite
end of the courtyard — a servant holding a torch

BANQUO (CONT’D)
Merciful powers
Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
Gives way to in repose

About to be revealed by the approaching torchlight Macbeth
steps out of the shadow to grab the torch as if he was
with the servant and approaches Banquo with him

BANQUO
Give me my sword
Who’s there

MACBETH
A friend

BANQUO
What sir not yet at rest

Macbeth enters with a servant

BANQUO (CONT’D)

He hath been in unusual pleasure and
Sent forth great largess to your offices

Our will became the servant to defect
Which else should free have wrought

BANQUO
All’s well
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters
To you they have showed some truth

MACBETH
I think not of them

Macbeth draws closer looking at Fleance

MACBETH
Yet when we can entreat an hour to serve
We would spend it in some words upon that business
If you would grant the time

BANQUO
At your kind’st leisure

TRACK IN on Fleance—nervously returning Macbeth’s stare as
he approaches

Macbeth’s hand reaches in and tousles his hair

MACBETH
Good repose the while

BANQUO
Thanks sir The like to you

Banquo draws his son away and they leave Macbeth turns to
his servant

MACBETH
Go bid thy mistress when my drink is ready
She strike upon the bell Get thee to bed

The servant leaves His footsteps fade away leaving the
faintest sound of wind Macbeth is alone again

Behind MACBETH the columns of a long colonnade FADE UP
intersected by moonlight

EXT INVERNESS - COLONNADE — NIGHT 16

He turns to face down the long colonnade which ends in a
huge oak door to the tower He moves with purpose toward
it his footsteps echoing off the stones then slows
noticing something

A faint shaft of light is glancing off the steel handle of
the door still distant and hard to see The wind
disappears Silence except his footsteps

MACBETH
Is this a dagger which I see before me
The handle toward my hand Come let me clutch thee

MACBETH’S POV TRACKING SLOWLY down the dark colonnade The
glancing light on the distant door handle describes the
shape of a knife

MACBETH (CONT’D)
I have thee not and yet I see thee still
Art thou not fatal vision sensible
To feeling as to sight Or art thou but
A dagger of the mind a false creation
Proceeding from the heat-oppresséd brain
I see thee yet in form as palpable
As this which now I draw

CLOSE as he draws a knife from the left sleeve of his
tunic—

MACBETH (CONT’D)
Thou marshal’st me the way that I was going
And such an instrument I was to use
Mine eyes are made the fools o’ th’ other senses
Or else worth all the rest I see thee still
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood
Which was not so before

Still advancing he moves his head to the side and as the
light shifts on the handle changing the effect

MACBETH (CONT’D)
There’s no such thing
It is the bloody business which informs
Thus to mine eyes Now o’er the one half-world
Nature seems dead and wicked dreams abuse
The curtained sleep
BLUE REVISED — 11620 27

A bell begins to toll in counterpoint to the rhythm of his
footsteps on the stones He looks up at the starry heavens

MACBETH (CONT’D)
Thou sure and firm-set earth
Hear not my steps which way they walk for fear
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout
I go and it is done The bell invites me

He expertly rolls the knife in his hand and we follow the
tip of the blade as it makes contact with door right next
to the handle and slowly pushes it open—into blackness

MACBETH (CONT’D)
Hear it not Duncan for it is a knell
That summons thee to heaven or to hell

INT INVERNESS - DUNCAN’S BEDCHAMBER — NIGHT

FADE IN FROM BLACK CLOSE ON DUNCANS SLEEPING EYES

The CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK over a dark shoulder- Macbeth-
- on the edge of the bed sitting close and looking down at

Duncan as he did Lady Macbeth

After a long moment Duncans eyes slowly open sensing
something

HIS POV The dark apparition looming over him
Macbeth raises his forefinger to his lips Quiet

Only slightly alarmed but still confused by sleep Duncan
slowly rises from the pillow

Macbeth puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder and gently
pushes him back down

BLUE REVISED — 11620 28

We hear the deep rhythmic sound of beating wings

Suddenly panicked Duncan bolts upright slamming into a CLOSE
UP over Macbeths shoulder--as if in an embrace

Macbeth slams him back down onto the bed raising the knife
Duncans hand flies up to grab his wrist--

As Duncan opens his mouth to scream Macbeth covers the
King’s face with his hand --

The beating wings grow louder

He presses his hand over Duncans mouth — the other strains to
plunge the knife

Duncan thrashes

Slowly he weakens The knife descends
Still thrashing

The wings beating

The knife pricks the skin of Duncans neck just below the pillow
and sinks in--

The SHRIEK of a bird
Blood gouts from his neck hitting Macbeth

Macbeth rears back the knife in his hand as--

Close on his arm hanging off the bed

We travel down the arm to his limp hand hovering over the

floor as a drop of blood descends his finger and hits the

floor with a dull THUMP

And another And another

Looking down from on high Macbeth a small figure sits on the
bloody bed next to Duncan’s body After a long beat he rises

the dagger in one hand

We hear the distant rhythmic thumping of the blood as Lady
Macbeth continues

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold
What hath quenched them hath given me fire

Still looking down from on high we follow Macbeth -the
camera moving over a chandelier (a wheel of birds) — then
where the grooms lie asleep on the floor

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
The doors are open and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores

He walks past the sleeping grooms and we move over another
door jamb as he disappears into blackness

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
I have drugged their possets
That death and nature do contend about them
Whether they live or die

LADY MACBETH

MACBETH

He looks down at his hand

MACBETH (CONT’D)
This is a sorry sight

LADY MACBETH
A foolish thought to say a sorry sight

MACBETH
There’s one did laugh in’s sleep and one cried “Murder”
That they did wake each other I stood and heard them
But they did say their prayers and addressed them
Again to sleep

LADY MACBETH
The grooms were lodged together

MACBETH
One cried “God bless us” and “Amen” the other
As they had seen me with these hangman’s hands
List’ning their fear I could not say “Amen”
When they did say “God bless us”

LADY MACBETH
Consider it not so deeply

MACBETH
But wherefore could not I pronounce “Amen”
I had most need of blessing and “Amen”
Stuck in my throat

LADY MACBETH
These deeds must not be thought
After these ways so it will make us mad

MACBETH
Methought I heard a voice cry “Sleep no more
Macbeth does murder sleep” — the innocent sleep

Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care
The death of each day’s life sore labor’s bath
Balm of hurt minds great nature’s second course
Chief nourisher in life’s feast

LADY MACBETH
What do you mean

MACBETH
Still it cried “Sleep no more” to all the house
“Glamis hath murdered sleep and therefore Cawdor
Shall sleep no more Macbeth shall sleep no more”

LADY MACBETH
Who was it that thus cried Why worthy thane
You do unbend your noble strength to think
So brainsickly of things Go get some water
And wash this filthy witness from your hand

Rather he approaches the bed and sits on it still holding
the dagger
BLUE REVISED — 11620 32

Why did you bring these daggers from the place
They must lie there go carry them and smear
The sleepy grooms with blood

MACBETH
(vacantly)
I’1l go no more
I am afraid to think what I have done
Look on’t again I dare not

Lady Macbeth puts her hands to either side of his face—

LADY MACBETH
Infirm of purpose

She looks down at her hand now stained with Duncan’s
blood

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
Give me the daggers The sleeping and the dead
Are but as pictures ‘Tis the eye of childhood
That fears a painted devil

Taking the daggers and leaving the room

LADY MACBETH (CONT’D)
If he do bleed
I’1ll gild the faces of the grooms withal
For it must seem their guilt
My hands are of your color but I shame
To wear a heart so white

The slow rhythm of the thumping has now grown louder
harsher and more brittle

MACBETH
Whence is that knocking
How is’t with me when every noise appalls me

He rises leaving a bloody hand print on the bed and walks
to a pitcher and a washbasin Unfolding his clenched hand
and plunging it in the basin

MACBETH
What hands are here Ha They pluck out mine eyes
Will all great Neptune’s ocean wash this blood
Clean from my hand No this my hand will rather
The multitudinous seas incarnadine
Making the green one red

With a violent swipe he knocks the basin aside

MACBETH (CONT’D)
To know my deed ‘twere best not know myself

The bloody water washes over the tabletop

PORTER
Marry sir nose-painting sleep and urine
Lechery sir it provokes and unprovokes it provokes the
desire but it takes away the performance Therefore much
drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery it
makes him and it mars him it sets him on and it takes
him off it persuades him and disheartens him makes him

Clamored the livelong night Some say the earth

How you were borne in hand how crossed the instruments
Who wrought with them and all things else that might
To half a soul and to a notion crazed
Say “Thus did Banquo”

Whose heavy hand hath bowed you to the grave
And beggared yours forever

That every minute of his being thrusts
Against my near’st of life and though I could
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
And bid my will avouch it yet I must not
For certain friends that are both his and mine
Whose loves I may not drop but wail his fall
Who I myself struck down And thence it is
That I to your assistance do make love
Masking the business from the common eye
For sundry weighty reasons

We shall my lord
Perform what you command us

Treason has done his worst nor steel nor poison
Malice domestic foreign levy nothing
Can touch him further

LADY MACBETH
Come on
Gentle my lord sleek o’er your rugged looks
Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight

MACBETH
O full of scorpions is my mind dear wife
Thou know’st that Banquo and his Fleance live
And in his royalty of nature reigns that
Which would be feared ‘Tis much he dares
And to that dauntless temper of his mind
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor
To act in safety There is none but he
Whose being I do fear

LADY MACBETH
You must leave this

MACBETH

He chid the sisters
When first they put the name of king upon me
And bade them speak to him Then profitlike
They hailed him father to a line of kings
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown
And put a barren scepter in my grip
Thence to be wrenched with an unlineal hand
No son of mine succeeding If’t be so
For Banquo’s issue have I filed my mind
For them the gracious Duncan have I murdered
Put rancors in the vessel of my peace
Only for them and mine eternal jewel
Given to the common enemy of man
To make them kings—the seeds of Banquo kings—

There’s comfort yet they are assailable
Then be thou jocund Ere the bat hath flown
His cloistered flight ere to black Hecate’s summons
The shard-born beetle with his drowsy hums
Hath rung night’s yawning peal there shall be done
A deed of dreadful note

LADY MACBETH
What’s to be done

MACBETH
Be innocent of the knowledge dearest chuck
Till thou applaud the deed

Macbeth reaches out his hand an invitation

MACBETH (CONT’D)

Come seeling night

Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
Which keeps me pale

She walks forward takes his hand and he draws her close

MACBETH (CONT’D)

Light thickens and the crow

Makes wing to th’ rooky wood

Good things of day begin to droop and drowse
While night’s black agents to their prey do rouse
Thou marvel’st at my words but hold thee still
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill

toward us one hand resting lightly on the handle of his

As the hooded man draws into CLOSEUP he raises his finger
to his lips entreating silence We see that it is Ross

Fleance is up and running running through the stone house into
a field of high grass

Banquo swings the torch at the murderer (Brian’s) head He
strikes a glancing blow that sends him to the ground in a

shower of sparks

He turns and throws the torch at his assailant He staggers
forward and is run through again by the murderer (Scott) and

kicked to the ground

With twenty trenchéd gashes on his head

Were the graced person of our Banquo present—
Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
Than pity for mischance

We hear a low beating sound

LENNOX
His absence sir
Lays blame upon his promise Please’t your highness
To grace us with your royal company

Louder now the sound has become the rhythmic beating of
wings

Macbeths looks toward the door to the hallway from whence
he came his glass aloft

WHOOSH—Something large and black flies by the doorway and
is gone

Here is a place reserved sir

Now a wounded figure holding a torch crosses the doorway

The time has been
That when the brains were out the man would die
And there an end But now they rise again
With twenty mortal murders on their crowns

The beating wings are louder now—accompanied by thumps and
shrieks—that seem to come from a room at the end of the

trapped in the room Macbeth leans back as it flies past
him and hits the wall—He dodges as it shrieks over him and
crashes into the window

the guests

She calmly enters the room and throws open the window

The bird flies out and flaps away into the moonlight The
sound of beating wings fades away

With most admired disorder

Macbeth sits on a low bench

MACBETH
Can such things be
And overcome us like a summers cloud
Without our special wonder You make me strange
Even to the disposition that I owe
When now I think you can behold such sights
And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks
When mine is blanched with fear

Stepped in so far that should I wade no more
Returning were as tedious as go oer
Strange things I have in head that will to hand
Which must be acted ere they may be scanned

pours Macbeth a drink

the bird escaped The black branch of a tree knocks at the
window pane in the wind

Elsewhere in the room something rustles

He turns to looks up into a dark corner of the room
Something black but just visible is hunched up in a high
alcove near the ceiling—looking down at him unblinking A
witch

Macbeth slowly sits up He looks to another corner

Another witch very still is perched on a high ledge in
the moonlight Also staring at him

A third witch at the apex of the ceiling is perched on an
iron chandelier staring directly down at us Her wings
slowly unfold

up a bloody finger and holds it between her teeth

And take a bond of fate Thou shalt not live

And wears upon his baby brow the round
And top of sovereignty

The third child’s face breeches the black water which
leaves blood dripping from his face

We hear a loud clatter from downstairs

The playful shrieks of the children have suddenly turned to

shrieks of fear
Smoke is billowing up the staircase and into the room
Heavy footsteps running up the stairs

Lady Macduff grabs her son and runs to the landing—

INT MACDUFFS LANDING — DAY

Two rough faces are emerging from the smoke near the top of
the staircase

LADY MACDUFF
What are these faces

MURDERER 3
Where is your husband

LADY MACDUFF
I hope in no place so unsanctified
Where such as thou mayst find him

MURDERER 3
He’s a traitor

The boy breaks away from his mother and rushes at the
murderer

SON
Thou liest

MURDERER 3
What you egg

The Murderer grabs him by the wrist with his right hand and
flings him into the smoke down the stairs

Lady Macduff screams and runs toward her son plunging down
the stairs

We follow her as she disappears into the smoke

The sound of mayhem fire and shrieking children fades out
to leave only the wind

EXT AN ALLEE OF TREES BIRNAM WOOD - DAY

The smoke has become fog and out of the fog emerge two
faces walking toward us through an allée of trees
They are Malcolm and Macduff

Weep our sad bosoms empty

MACDUFF
Let us rather
Hold fast the mortal sword and like good men
Bestride our downfall birthdom Each new morn
New widows howl new orphans cry new sorrows
Strike heaven on the face that it resounds
As if it felt with Scotland and yelled out
Like syllable of dolor

The fog behind them is blowing away

MALCOLM
What you have spoke it may be so perchance
This tyrant whose sole name blisters our tongues
Was once thought honest

We see Ross approaching from the direction of the camp

MALCOLM
See who comes here

MACDUFF
My ever gentle cousin welcome hither

MALCOLM
I know him now Good God betimes remove
The means that makes us strangers

ROSS
Sir amen

MACDUFF
Stands Scotland where it did

ROSS
Alas poor country
Almost afraid to know itself It cannot
Be called our mother but our grave where nothing
But who knows nothing is once seen to smile
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
Are made not marked where violent sorrow seems
A modern ecstasy

MACDUFF

Too nice and yet too true

MACDUFF
And all my children
ROSS
--Well too
MACDUFF
The tyrant has not battered at their peace
ROSS
No they were well at peace when I did leave ‘em
MACDUFF

Be not a niggard of your speech How goes’t

Changing the subject

ROSS
When I came hither to transport the tidings
Which I have heavily borne there ran a rumor
Of many worthy fellows that were out
Which was to my belief witnessed the rather
For that I saw the tyrant’s power afoot
Now is the time of help Your eye in Scotland
Would create soldiers make our women fight
To doff their dire distresses

Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men

This comfort with the like But I have words
That would be howled out in the desert air
Where hearing should not latch them

MACDUFF
What concern they
The general cause or is it a fee-grief
Due to some single breast

ROSS
No mind that’s honest
But in it shares some woe though the main part
Pertains to you alone

MACDUFF
If it be mine
Keep it not from me quickly let me have it

ROSS
Let not your ears despise my tongue forever
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
That ever yet they heard

MACDUFF
Hmm—I guess at it

ROSS
Your castle is surprised your wife and babes
Savagely slaughtered To relate the manner
Were on the quarry of these murdered dear
To add the death of you

Give sorrow words The grief that does not speak
Whispers the o’erfraught heart and bids it break

Let’s make us med’cines of our great revenge
To cure this deadly grief

MACDUFF

Did you say all O hellkite All
What all my pretty chickens and their dam
At one fell swoop

MALCOLM
Dispute it like a man

MACDUFF
I shall do so
But I must also feel it as a man
I cannot but remember such things were
That were most precious to me Did heaven look on
And would not take their part Sinful Macduff
They were all struck for thee Naught that I am
Not for their own demerits but for mine
Fell slaughter on their souls Heaven rest them now

MALCOLM
Be this the whetstone of your sword Let grief
Convert to anger blunt not the heart enrage it

MACDUFF
O I could play the woman with mine eyes
And braggart with my tongue But gentle heavens
Cut short all intermission Front to front
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself
Within my sword’s length set him If he scape
Heaven forgive him too

draw close Macbeth raises his arms palms out almost

nimbly back the steel just grazing the front of his armor

turns his head away the blade just missing him and kicks
Siward to the ground The sword clatters out of his hand
and skates across the floor
