A young Woman’s Voice is heard over various shots of
Kankakee Illinois It’s Summer 1974

A ROAD SIGN on a rural back road reads Welcome to the City
of Kankakee Just below Buy Local Hire Local

WOMAN’S VOICE
Some people don’t mind simple
lives ey look forward to the
dusk The sound of loneliness makes
them happy

CORN FIELDS sit quietly under a fading-sun sky

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
I never wanted that life I wanted
to hear the city Its roar I did
for a little while too modeled up
in windy city itself

COURT STREET the primary vein of town Taverns delis
nightclubs

WOMANS VOICE (CONT’D)
Catalogs mostly Sears Spiegel
Eaton’s I wasn’t one’a the tops
but close to it I was told that
during the years I graced their
pages I moved more pant suits than
anyone else

A BOAT LAUNCH RAMP a Father and Son lower a cruiser into the
river

WOMANS VOICE (CONT’D)
They wanted me for lingerie too
but I wouldn’t do it I hada
feeling y’know that if I did
thatwe 1you can’t go back
from there And if I ever met a
man I was right too Your
Father would never have gone for
that kinda business

THE KANKAKEE RIVER picturesque dotted with ski boats
pontoons and bowriders Summer’s here and sunglass days and
there’s a wonderful BUZZ in the air

WOMANS VOICE (CONT’D)
Oh we had such deep feelings for each
other Of course I knew he wasn’t
long for a town like this The world
outside just gave him a better shake
at things I guess I could be mad
But he gave me you Nanc I always
knew you were special W én you were
just five years old this man came up
to me at the mall

TWO BROTHERS skitter across a wake aboard an inner tube

WOMANS VOICE (CONT’D
Came right up to me and asked i
you might be interested in doin
some modeling I said no uh-u
she’s too young
WOMAN’S VOICE (CONT’D)
There’s training still to be done
(chuckles)
Truth is you probably could’ve been
a star right then I think part of
me just wanted you for myself

THE YESTERYEAR an elegant waterfront restaurant Guests
arrive by boat THROUGH THE RESTAURANT WINDOWS a packed
Saturday night crowd Tables of well-heeled men and women

WOMAN’S VOICE (CONTD)
When I was a girl my Mom would
talk about Shirley Temple How the
same word came to everyone’s mind
when they saw herSparkle

THE KANKAKEE RIVER ANOTHER VIEW

FISHERMAN casts on a sandy shore A modest current GURGLES

SHOOSH-SHOOSH Hair dye is applied to the brown roots The
thick murky substance spread to the edges with a brush

A WIDER SHOT REVEALS

a MODEST BATHROOM with passe tiling cluttered with beauty-
making accessories A RADIO is set to a rock station

In the mirror CONNIE RISH (the voice we’ve been hearing)
stands over the sink applying the dye to an unseen child
She’s 30 single mother more girl than woman and that’s
intentional Connie’s petrified of aging

CONNIE
When I was pregnant with you I
prayed that you were pretty
Connie chuckles almost embarrassed

INT CONNIE’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

THE HUM OF A HELMET DRYER Connie stands over the child
smoking a Tareyton 100 watching a kitchen timer wind down

DING A final drag and Connie takes the dryer hose from the

gotd hood’s aperture Reaching back she shuts off the UFO-
ike hub removes the cap now and teases the hair

CONNIE
Go ahead and stand up girl

The young girl stands WE SEE HER NOW in the vanity mirror
NANCY RISH The most beautiful 9-year-old we’ve ever seen
Under that almost white-hot golden hair the purest unmarked
face and the most brilliant cerulean eyes eyes that stand
out in a crowd

CONNIE (CONT’D)
You have his eyes

A long moment Nancy studies herself fiercely in the mirror

NANCY
No I don’t Not at all If they
look like anyone it’s you

That warms Connie who leans close

CONNIE
You’re the most beautiful girl in
the whole world Nancy

A DISCORDANT CONCERT OF FEMALE VOICES —

INT MARRIOTT HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM — MORNING

And over it all the VOICES OF MOTHERS peppering their
restive daughters with eleventh-hour directives

Connie and Nancy have found some space in the corner Connie
applies powder blush to Nancy’ s cheeks while Nancy spies THE
JUDGES as they amble about the Banquet Room Among them a

middle-aged HEAVYSET JUDGE Nancy locks in on him intensely

EXT RISH HOME (BUNGALOW STYLE) BACKYARD — AFTERNOON

A RUBBER BALL rolls before her She searches for its source
A FACE peers over the top of of the neighboring fence JIMMY
KEENE 10 the new neighbo long-haired and red-blooded

Ignoring him Nancy looks back down and continues to comb the
doll’s hair

Jimmy VAULTS the fence and heads over stopping within
inches of Nancy His eyes never leave her as he bends down to
pick up the ball

JIMMY

Nancy sniffs
NANCY

She turns away and walks back towards the house

JIMMY

She pauses at the rear door her back still facing him

NANCY
You’re not my type

JIMMY
Oh yeah Well what’s your type

NANCY
Rich and famous

She smiles to herself then her face goes slack and she turns
back to Jimmy her expression laissez faire

NANCY (CONTD)
You can come swimming with me

(patronizing)
If it’s okay with your parents

He regards her as if discovering a new species as the BACK
DOOR SLAMS shut behind Nancy
EXT KANKAKEE RIVER DOCK — AFTERNOON

Atop a beach chaise Connie’s fallen asleep with an
alarmingly scarlet sunburn developing Nearby a BEVY OF
CHILDREN swim around a dock Nancy and Jimmy among them

Nancy climbs up the steps of the slide Glides down head-
first She surfaces clears her face

PSSSK - something SCREAMS ACROSS THE SKY A TRIO OF TEENS
lighting bottle rockets off a nearby dock

Just then Jimmy DIVES into the water SWIMS over to the
teens ingratiates himself and is quickly lighting his own
bottle rocket PSSSSK

A queer feeling burgeons inside Nancy Foreign New Mostly

at Connie who wakes with a start her sunglasses lopsided

fleeting footfalls and giggles

He slides down an ESCARPMENTBounds across a thin BABBLING
ROCK STREAMScales an enormous fallen HARDWOODPushes
through clouds of FOREST SHRUBSthe trail growing rockier
the forest more dense the trees misshapen

Finally he pauses Through the leaf-thick treetops daylight
is dying fast For a moment he almost looks nervous He

stops at the trunk of an ANCIENT ELM a giant elder statesman
towering over the young upstart birch pine and firs Then —

NANCY (0C)
Scared

Nancy’s head emerges from the ground like a periscope and
then disappears again

Jimmy nears looks down into THE NEOLITHIC FISSURE in which
she stands a deep groove in the forest floor

NANCY (CONT’D)
Use the ladder

Jimmy descends an OLD WOODEN LADDER propped against one the
walls of moss-covered mudstone Jimmy’s entranced by the
hidden cleft —

How’d you ever find this
NANCY
Everyone’s got a place no one else
knows about it — this one is mine

JIMMY
Yeah right I know about it now

NANCY
(wry smile)
No you don’t You’re lost

His face changes he is Very lost Turning back to Nancy
her focus is elsewhere He watches as her fingertips wor
back-and-forth the scores of an ancient etching in the
mudstone Her hand clears to reveal a long-forgotten
declaration of love Jimmy Loves Nunu

NANCY (CONTD)
Wow looks like you’ve already got
a girlfriend

A moment passes

JIMMY
That’s right Nunu

In spite of herself she GIGGLES Then looks at him with the
most Bike we stare and then takes off racing away up the
trenc He watches her go glances back at the me you
sentiment in the rock face and then hightails it after her

INT ALYSSA’S BOUTIQUE — AFTERNOON — 1981
CLOSE ON FINGERTIPS grazing along chiffon blouses

Nancy now 16 slender and radiant drifts through the aisles
of this upscale ladies boutique her hands touching

ever thing as if to memorize a texture or cut to be fitly
recalled later At home Alone

BEHIND THE COUNTER TWO PUFFED-UP salesclerks snoop Nancy

FIRST SALESCLERK
Look who’s back

SECOND SALESCLERK
She was in yesterday

FIRST SALESCLERK
I haven’t caught her yet But it’s
not just sticky- fingers with that
one She’s a collector

Nancy’s radar is tuned-in She turns suddenly and approaches
the counter eyes fixed on the two women who stiffen

FIRST SALESCLERK (CONT’D)

Can 1help you with something
NANCY
When’s the Fall line arrive

FIRST SALESCLERK
(swallows )
Sometime in the next two weeks

NANCY
Wow That far away

SECOND SALESCLERK
At least Maybe three

A long awkward beat Nancy seems troubled like she’s
staring right through the Salesclerks Slowly they realize
she’s not staring at them at all Turning their heads the
see the object of her affection a stunning RED SILK VERSACE
DRESS hanging in the display window Price tag 295

They turn back to Nancy but she’s already out the door
standing on the sidewalk Her eyes careening and caressing
the Versace on the other side of the storefront window

INT KOEHLER’S DOLLAR STORE MAIN STREET — AFTERNOON

Connie’s in uniform — apron nametag and Koehler’s visor

approaches and points out some flaw he sees in the display
Connie begins taking the boxes down one-by-one

Nancy looks away in vicarious embarrassment and takes off

EXT RIVERVIEW DISTRICT — KANKAKEE — ON BIKE WHEELS TURNING

as Nancy cruises down the road head swiveling from side-to-—
side as she takes in the ESTATE HOMES on the tree-lined road

She stops pedaling suddenly lets her sneakers scrape the
ground and bring herself to a stop She stares awed by — THE
PRETTIEST HOUSE IN TOWN Behind wrought iron gates a ng
drive winds to a stunning asymmetrical QUEEN ANNE VICTORIAN
MANSION steeply pitched roofs turrets gables She studies
the home every angle and line then —

BEEP Startles Nancy A MERCEDEZ-BENZ 250 SEDAN has arrived
at the gates and is trying to ride through

IN THE BACKSEAT two distinguished-looking men in tailored

suits GERALD SMALL 60s and his son STEPHEN SMALL 40s

Nancy watches as Gerald malignantly scolds Stephen for some
unknowable decision

TAP-TAP-TAP THE DRIVER pantomimes for Nancy to clear out
Soon Gerald’s taken notice and TAPS as well

Undaunted Nancy moves her bike mere inches just enough for
the Mercedes to slip past
She watches the car as it travels up the drive and is still
watching when THE DRIVER opens the car doors for Stephen and
Gerald and they begin to disappear behind the automatically
closing Front Gate

— PONG-PONG-PONG —

EXT GRASS TENNIS COURT COUNTRY CLUB — AFTERNOON
A FOURSOME OF WHITE-SKIRTED WOMEN play a friendly game

Standing outside the court’s perimeter fence Nancy watches
these women of leisure as if she’s studying for the bar exam
The women LAUGH following a particularly errant Swing Nancy
mimics their laugh Ha-ha-ha Isn’t happy with it adjusts
her inflection - Ha-ha-ha

ROCK MUSIC BLARES from a BMW 3-Series Convertible as it
breezes past behind Nancy and swings into the lot adjacent to
the courts The driver CHAD 20 popped-collar polo and
argyle sweater lowers his wraparound shades to view Nancy

He doesn’t say a word instead allowing his wheels and wavy
blonde hair to do the talking Nancy’s thinking when — POP —
the trunk opens like an invitation

INT PARAMOUNT THEATER — NIGHT
A COUPLE FULLY ENTWINED alone in the BACK ROW necking

VOICES ON SCREEN
Hardin called today - He said

He apologized for the delay

A PAIR of HANDS reaches around Chad’s head and pushes him
away revealing Nancy Her eyes suddenly riveted to the action
on the screen Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner) and Ned Racine
(William Hurt) in the final act of Lawrence Kasdan’s BODY
HEAT

RACINE
Theyve been stalling The
draggin it out hoping theyd come
up with some way to implicate you

Matty turns and leans against him looking into his face
full of love

MATTY
But they havent been able to
Soon itll be all ours Thats why
weve got to hold together Ned
It wont be long then well get
away from here Out from under all

MOVE IN ON NANCY looking as if she is having something
tantamount to a religious experience

MATTY (0C) (CONTD)
All we have is each other Id kill
myself if I thought this thing
would destroy us I couldnt take
it

EXT RISH HOUSE — NIGHT

Chad lifts Nancy’s bicycle from the trunk of his Beemer sets
it down on the sidewalk and then leans in for a kiss Nancy
lets him have a chaste one He jumps into his car and is off
She watches him go and then starts walking her bike toward
her front door when she suddenly notices —

JIMMY staring at her from across the lawn He stands next to
a HARLEY SX-125 MOTORCYCLE tanktop still sullied from a day
of donkeywork He’s 16 now his long hair and natural build
exude a brutish sexuality

Her face grimaces and she drops her bike moving quickly
toward him

NANCY
Jimmy

He shakes his head knowingly and immediately disappears
inside his house

NANCY (CONTD)
(caught )
Shoot

She turns on her heels and heads back to her own house

MATTY (0C)
Ned I dont know what you think
but youre wrong

INT PARAMOUNT THEATER — DAY

A Saturday matinée at the end of long run Nancy sits alone
in the front row with her neck craned upat the screen her
lips mouthing the words now by heart — albeit a cold one at
that

elieve me

RACINE
Keep talking Matty Experience

NANCY’s FACE a perfect mirror of Turner’s matching every
nuance of “surprise” and false indignation

EXT KANKAKEE RIVER CLIFF — MAGIC

Quiescent Peaceful Then in the distance TWO FIGURES DASH
TOWARD A CLIFF’S EDGE — Nancy and Jimmy — AND LEAP OFF —

SPLOOSH SPLOOSH they’re swallowed by the river

RIVER

Nancy surfaces from the jump Looks around for Jimmy He’s
nowhere The water slowly becomes placid again Concern
registers on her face when —

Jimmy bursts up and DUNKS Nancy

JIMMY
Gotcha Nunu

She SPLASHES him playfully then watches as he backstrokes
away enjoying the warm sun on his face

NANCY
dimmy
JIMMY
Mmm hmm
NANCY
How come you broke up with me
(off his laugh)

I’m serious

JIMMY
The reason was driving a BMW

NANCY
Oh that’s so stupid He’s nothing

thing would destroy us I couldnt
take it

JIMMY
Quit the act Nancy It’s okay

NANCY
What’s there to get

JIMMY
Who you are What you want I
understand yknow

She swims out towards him Wraps her arms around his back
NANCY
Sometimes I think you’re the only
person who does

He looks back at her Eyes on eyes A long anxious moment
She moves in to kiss him when —
Jimmy slips underwater only to emerge seconds later on the
riverbank Climbs out of the water mounts a boulder and lays
out in the sun Nancy’s indignant

NANCY (CONT’D)
That was a cheap trick

He puts his hands behind his head shuts his eyes and lets
out a very satisfied SIGH

JIMMY
End of the rainbow up here Nunu
Better hurry the sun won’t be
around much longer

She takes a moment then swims toward him Climbs onto the
boulder and lays beside him in the vanishing sun

folded and arranged Most haven’t been worn price tags stitl

Nancy pulls the dress straps over her shoulders Reaches her
hands back slides up the back zipper

She slips on high heels Dabs her eyes with mascara at the
vanity Puts on diamond earrings A necklace A bracelet

Finally Nancy stands before the Cheval mirror The outfit’s
complete She looks 10 years older and strangely glamorous
as if she’s stepped out of the society pages

She retreats glances over her shoulder to the mirror on the
opposing wall keen to analyze every angle Suddenly SCOTTY
APPEARS in triplicate reflected like an echo

Nancy turns to find him standing in the doorway sucking his
thumb An anxious beat she’s busted The two continue to
stare at each other Eyes on eyes a Mexican stand-off

The moment is broken by Nancy Her eyes narrow and she stares
hypnotically at the little boy And then as if feeling the
beat of a song only she can hear she begins to Cha-Cha

Scotty stares oddly mesmerized

view When he raises his eyes she’s looking at him He
smiles innocuously as she pops the gum into her mouth

NANCY (CONT’D)

TOM STEARNS

Something in Tom’s face changes He turns off the main road
Pushes a button on the panel Lowers the windows

He downshifts The CAR GROANS coming alive

The noise and sudden speed alarm Nancy who for a moment seems
to regret having posed the dare

Tom downshifts” a ain JAMS the gas THE SPEEDOMETER hits 80
Climbs to 90 0

He glances over at Nancy Her hair is a wildfire in the
whipping wind She’s smiling now and laughing

Downshifts again The Mazda’s PURRING NOW110120125

She gives up and puts her head up against the window

TOM STEARNS

EXT RISH HOMEINT MAZDA RX-7 — NIGHT

The RX-7 idles by the curb Nancy’s about to open the door
when she looks out the window

JIMMYS IN HIS DRIVEWAY straddling his motorbike A 21-YEAR-
OLD BLONDE at his side He’s explaining the gears and she’s
giggling His hands slide up the back of her blouse

Nancy turns to Tom

NANCY
Walk me to the door

TOM STEARNS

He steps out of the car When he walks around to the
passenger side Nancy’s still inside He opens her door

TOM STEARNS (CONTD)
Everything okay

NANCY
(sotto)
The boy next door scares me

She extends her hand Tom takes it and she steps out of the
car They walk up the steps to the front door and she turns
to him and stares right into his eyes He grows increasingly
uncomfortable with the attention especially around these
witnesses Which of course is precisely what Nancy wants

TOM STEARNS
Your Mom’s probably waiting up for
you don’t you think

Suddenly she wraps her arms around Tom looking past his
shoulder toward Jimmy but he’s well up to speed and clocking
her stagecraft Something passes between the two a private
understanding a silent tip of the hat

Nancy releases Tom as quickly as she embraced him and with
little fanfare heads inside

Tom is confused but manages to make his way back to his not-
long-for-this-world Mazda and drive off

VRMMM the engine of Jimmy’s motorbike growls to life Blonde
wraps her arms around him so tight They ride off into the
night Blonde hair blows wildly It is a dancing fire

mantel mirror askew and he smiles

But she’s still appraising the room casually as if Jimmy’s
come to her for a favor and not vice versa

getting too big Now we’re being
bullied out of town But I guess

FBI PICTURES OF DANNY At the phone booth The rough sketch
of the box Small dead Danny’s pick-up motorcycle etc

Danny stares blankly at the file Winston the appointed
ublic defender sits across from him editorializing the
images but all Danny hears is the SOUND of the PHOTOS being
flipped Then as though coming up from underwater —

RON WINSTON
— They’re asking for the death
penalty Danny Danny

DANNY
(soft nearly inaudible)
I nevermeant for him to die

RON WINSTON
Danny those hoses were ripped from
the ground The fan’s power was
cut

DANNY
But II checked the fan

RON WINSTON
When you didn’t get the money
you rode back out to Weichert Road
on your motorcycle —

Danny’s trying to remember His head hurts

DANNY
---No no I never

RON WINSTON
--You didn’t want to leave any
chance he might identify you But
the guilt was too great finally
wasn’t it That’s when you made the
call to Elaine Small

DANNY
He mustve pulled them out
somehowby mistake or

RON WINSTON
Youre telling me Small pulled the
hoses and cut the battery that was
keeping him alive Please Danny

caused enough harm

Then —
RON WINSTON (CONTD)
Elaine Small had a heart attack
last night Died on her kitchen
floor

A moment Danny’s face falls and he starts to hyperventilate

DANNY
That’s terrible terrible Oh no
it’s all my fault

RON WINSTON
Police say she was particularly
agitated about the money That they
hadn’t recovered it and that no
one would believe her that the guy
that did all this was named Eddie

A beat Then Danny suddenly looks up This name though he
can’t place it is somehow familiar — Elaine having greeted
him with this moniker the last time she answered the phone

DANNY
Eddie

RON WINSTON
she said she delivered the money to
im

Danny looks even more confused

DANNY
There was never any money

RON WINSTON

the right thing to do

of the forest you’ll find a bag
inside that bag you’ll find
instructions

EXT EDGE OF THE WOODS — MOMENTS LATER

Elaine steps through high grass There waiting is a BLUE
DUFFLE BAG She unzips it A NOTECARD sits inside with
DIRECTIONS written out

MOMENTS LATER — Elaine transfers STACK AFTER STACK OF GOLD
CERTIFICATES from her duffle bag into the blue one

letter

WE’RE IN THE DARK THEN — A LIGHT GLOWS

FOLLOW the colored wires to a 12V BATTERY and their
connection to a small BOOM BOX with an already depressed
‘PLAY’ button It’s RED LIGHT GLOWS and Suddenly Eddie
Money’s BABY HOLD ON blares from its’ speakers

EXT WOODS — MINUTES LATER — A SERIES OF SHOTS OF ELAINE

lugging the heavy duffle bag through PARTS OF THE FOREST
trying desperately to follow the directions in hand The
song’s volume increasing as Elaine trudges onward

When you hear Eddie Money’s
voice

She TIPTOES down an ESCARPMENT Slips and rides on her ass
the rest of the way down

She TRUDGES across a thin BABBLING ROCK STREAM Her shoes
SOPPING with waterThe WIND is picking up

SMALL (VO) (CONT’D)
--- you will have exactly three
minutes and 31 seconds to quickly
follow it

She maladroitly CLIMBS under an enormous fallen HARDWOOD

She pushes through THICKETS OF FOREST SHRUBS that scrape her
arms and chins and neck and debris gets in her mouth

SMALL (VO) (CONT’D)
--until you see a single giant Elm
tree

She looks around frantically for the tree and finally sees
it a FAMILIAR ANCIENT ELM

SMALL (VO) (CONT’D)
Stop there Do not continue towards
the music Place this note back
into the bag and throw it as far as
you can in the direction of Eddie’s
voice This must be done before the
song ends

She stumbles quickly over to it’s trunk Unzips the bag
inserts the directions turns her head this way and that
trying to get an exact bead on the music and then hoists up
the bag and swings it back-and-forth before letting it fly

As it arches towards us it’s descent seems impossibly and
improbably long — down down down just as the song ends

wasn’t the way she came in She starts walking East No no
that’s not it West now Doesn’t seem right She freezes

As he passes other cells Inmates HECKLING the ‘new fish’
Gonna fuck you in your ass boy then make you lick my dick

DANNY
(to himself)
Smiling why are you smiling

AND IT HITS DANNY ALL AT ONCE A yoke he cannot bear His
legs fail him He collapses to the ground

GUARDS PULL HIM TO HIS FEET BARKING ORDERS INTO HIS EAR

He stares up at them blankly Can’t hear a word

TWO GUARDS oneon each arm carry him along the concrete
concourse his limp legs dragging behind him And then ina
final futile plea he SCREAMS OUT —

DANNY (CONTD)

and vampires She looks up at the clock 530 AM

MINUTES LATER — Nancy grabs her coat from the rack Gene’s
counting totals at the register

NANC
G’night Gene

NEWTON ROAD — PREDAWN

Nancy’s Mazda approaches the dead-end pulls to the dirt
shoulder where the engine is cut

Everything still eerily quiet She steps from the car and
sets out into the woods
EXT DEEP FISSURE IN THE FOREST FLOOR — DAWN

Inside the hole looking up at early light reflected through the
forest canopy FOOTSTEPS and Nancy’s face peers down at us

She climbs down the old wood ladder

Coolly notices the blue duffle bag Rolls it over unzips it

There’s the money STACKS AND STACKS OF GOLD CERTIFICATES
She smiles casually as though there was never any doubt

Reaches down and yanks the timer from the boombox and
manually presses play Eddie Money’s ‘Baby Hold On’

She does a little dance over to the mudstone wall Fingers
grazing the primordial stone As though hearing a voice she
stops Brushes away some dust and moss until she finds the
ancient etching — Jimmy loves Nunu

EDDIE MONEY’S VOICE BEGINS TO ECHO AS IF FROM A GREAT DISTANCE

INT STATEVILLE ISOLATION — NIGHT

Danny wearing a straight-Jacket sits on the floor of a
padded cell rocking back and forth back and forth His lips
move to Money’s lyrics but he makes not a sound

THE RHYTHMIC CLAP OF gentle WAVES caressing THE SHORE OF —

AN IMPOSSIBLY BEAUTIFUL BLINDING WHITE BEACH

-and a fingerwriting in the sandas it curls the final
letter of — Jimmy Loves Nunu

Nancy clad in a black bikini hiding beneath a white caftan
reclines on a tasteful beige coloured chaise Wayfarers in
place and a wide-brimmed straw hat to top it all off

She glances down the beach where A BEAUTIFUL FRENCH COUPLE
lounge outside their private bungalow

Suddenly her sun is blocked She glances up to see the back-
lit face of —

JIMMY KEENE

His torso shirtless and golden He bends down and hands her
a cocktail

She squints at the drink and then lowers it staring off
toward the sea at someplace 1000 miles away from here

JIMMY
What’s the matter

A moment Then —
NANCY
(lost in herself)
Just give me a minute
« will ya Jimmy
He shrugs

JIMMY
Sure Nancy

Jimmy turns and heads off down the beach

Watching him go Nancy looks disturbed as if something is
troubling her some deep moral dilemma that must be puzzled
through alone

Nancy reaches into her beach bag and retrieves the BORA BORA
ADVERTISEMENT she was coveting earlier in the story

It’s now clear Nancy is lying on the exact same beach
wearing the exact bathing suit as the model in the picture

same hat sunglasses and thanks to Jimmy the exact same
drink — right down to the glassware

Looking at the picture her eyes narrow

Her arm begins to move ever so slightly to match the position
of the hand that’s holding the colorful libation in the picture

She reaches over to adjust the ORANGE MARASCHINO GARNISH
until it’s precisely as it is in the resort’s advert of a
kind with everything else

Then and only then does her hand lower the fanciful ad
tucking it back into her bag

She returns to her exalted pose on the chaise
Her ample chest rising and slowly exhaling and then finally

She smiles Not a pageant smile but an expression that is the
most genuine and authentic to ever grace her face

The moment seminal for her — at last a perfect mirror

Wave uponwave crash upon the shore Over and over again
As relentless as the strange woman reclining above them

The names in the sand begin to disappear
Each wave taking another few letters away

Until finally it’s as if they were never here at all

THE END
