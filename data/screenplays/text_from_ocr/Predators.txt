BLACK

Ragged BREATHING over it rising in intensity and volume
Heart POUNDING POUNDING POUNDING like a jackhammer
threatening to tear itself out of the rib cage

And a voice calm measured eerily juxtaposed against the
rest of the soundtrack

VOICE (VO)

The jungle creed says the strongest
feed on any prey they can And I
was branded beast at every feast
before I ever became a man

EXT STREETS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

WHAM the first shot of the movie assaults us in the form of
a man EXPLODING into frame -- powerful dangerous the kind
of cat who can kill you with a hard look But now he’s
scared running as if hell itself was behind him

Around him a nameless city towers like a concrete jungle

With the fugitive moving handheld frenetic jarring
echoing his state of mind

PREDATOR POV The prey in infrared seen from above

The man glances back sees nothing -- redoubles his already
punishing pace

Turns the corner -- left or right split second to decide --
he goes left -- powers along the street arms pumping like
pistons shoes SLAPPING the shit out of the pavement a
staccato rhythm -- trips falls -- staggers back on his feet
using a chainlink fence for purchase

SOMETHING LUNGES AT HIM FROM THE SHADOWS ON THE OTHER SIDE

A leashed pitbull -- its jaws SNAP a few inches away from our
guy’s face

He reels gun up -- the hound SNARLS trying to get at the
intruder -- but whatever is chasing him is much worse -- he
recovers rushes away an adrenaline-powered juggernaut the
dogs BARK chasing him like a stream of obscenities

Alley alley dead end shit He spins scanning for exits
there are none double shit about to backtrack--
In the distance the dog abruptly SHUTS UP

He freezes Back against the wall Pistol pointed at the
mouth of the alley held in a shaky grip The look of a man
about to face a six foot spider with a toothpick

Street light BUZZES flickering in and out of existence An
unsettling strobing effect

The man waits sucking air finger on the trigger waits
waits

Nothing
He relaxes just a bit
WHAM he’s JERKED upward as if plucked by an invisible hand

Make it a noose He dangles from it losing the gun in the
process tips of his toes scraping the ground A liquid
brown and viscous SPLASHES from above drenching him

He chokes FOOTSTEPS The hunter approaches We fully expect
to see Predator

Guess again Or rather it is a predator of a different kind

Call him ROYCE A Steve McQueen face hard but not
unhandsome Barely broke a sweat Takes off Raptor infrared
goggles

The man stares at him eyes wide with terror GURGLING Mouth
trying to form words that never come

It doesn’t matter Royce’s heard it all before The voice
from the opening shot

ROYCE
This is not how I would do it But
it’s how they wanted it done

He lights a match against his finger Tosses it into the
spreading puddle Walks away without looking back

WHOOSH The man lights up like a bonfire SCREAMS as he burns
alive

Royce keeps walking

SUDDENLY
An electric wind SWEEPS along the street
POP POP POP lights BLOW out in quick succession

Royce spins sensing something coming up from behind a split
second before--

IMPACT SMASH TO BLACK Blood red letters
PREDATORS
FADE IN

An ocean of white A body PLUMMETS toward it almost
peaceful a fallen angel

TEARS through the clouds
ROYCE

Eyes snap open disoriented panicked Mind behind them
races coming back online trying to regain its bearings
Discovering that he is--

IN FREEFALL

That’s right He’s plummeting through the void at 160 mph an
earthbound missile dressed in the same clothes he wore a
moment ago twisting tumbling SCREAMING wind HOWLING
whipping mercilessly at his hair and flesh

Just like the nightmare weve all had
Except this IS FUCKING HAPPENING

Reality is a washerdryer in a spin cycle With each rotation
we catch a glimpse of blue above a vast expanse of green
below the latter closing fast

An altimeter of foreign design is hooked to a harness
crossing Royce’s chest LED flashes in a degrading
sequence a countdown and then the thing cracks

Parachute deploys with a POP Much like the altimeter that
triggered its release its design is unfamiliar to us

Royce goes from terminal velocity to 30 in less than a
second deceleration jerking him up Jungle looms IMPACT
EXT JUNGLE - DAY

Royce CRASHES through the double canopy at a 45 degree angle
BASHING against trunks CLIPPING branches before finally--

Hitting the ground HARD

Beat Royce climbs to his feet Tries to steady his ragged
breathing Uncouples the chute’s harness with shaky fingers
Takes in his surroundings

He’s in a small clearing framed by monstrous tropical trees
plants and bushes obscuring vision in all directions Shafts
of light stream from openings in the foliage a hundred feet
above The steady BUZZ of insects punctuated by occasional
CRIES of birds and monkeys breaks the eerie silence

It’s haunting Humid And hot as hell
Royce stares in a state of shock One question

ROYCE
What the fuck

CRASH A chute-laden figure duplicates Royce’s descent

VOICE
(in Spanish)
Fuck FUCK FUCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKK

Royce watches All he can do is watch

The man lands a few feet away Twin Uzis are strapped to his
back An intricate webwork of scars and tattoos covers his
torso His age unplacable His real name immaterial But in
places like Juarez and Tijuana he’s known as--

CUCHILLO
(Spanish)
Who the hell are you

CRASH A body SMASHES on the ground like a cannon ball
stealing their attention This one won’t be getting up

CUCHILLO
(Spanish)
Who the hell is he

POP the dead man’s chute unfurls Too little too late
ROYCE
The guy whose chute didn’t work

He hears muted voices Moves confusion pushing up against
something harder on the inside

CUCHILLO
(switches to English)
Hey Hey Where the fuck are you
going Hey

He tries to follow gets tangled in the chute lines They
jerk him back Curses some more We leave him to it

EXT JUNGLE - DAY

With Royce slicing through thick vegetation toward voices
panicked SHOUTING in languages we don’t understand

EXT CLEARING - DAY

Parachutes strewn about NIKOLAI a frightening bear of a man
in VDV fatigues with no identity badges or insignias armed
with GShG-762 -- a four barreled gas powered rotary machine
gun its barrel still smoking -- is yelling in Russian at--

ISABELLE jeans and button down shirt pretty if she ever
bothered to smile her own Heckler and Koch PSG1 sniper rifle
pointed at the big man as she yells back in French

What we have here is a failure to communicate

Heads and weapons turn to Royce as he appears Both yell at
him for a change

He raises his hands indicating intention rather than
surrender

ROYCE
Easy

Branches CRACK Leaves rain down All spin toward the source

Fifteen feet above STANS -- shaved head scorpion tattoo on
his neck orange jumpsuit with the faded words “San Quentin”
stenciled into the fabric -- is cutting through the lines of

his chute with a prison shiv
Drops Lands on his feet like a cat Backs away from the
others feral stabbing at the air

STANS
I’m gonna cut you I’m gonna
fucking cut you

And stops hand wrapped around his mouth blade pressed
firmly against his carotid artery

Their owner MOMBASA materializes behind Stans with the
silent swiftness of a ghost Black Early 20’s But in the
part of the world he comes from he’s considered old

MOMBASA
(African accent cold)
Put down your weapons Or he dies

The confused group take one another in with weary eyes
Paranoia Panic A hairline away from a trigger pull

Nikolai is about to say something Royce motions for him to
keep quiet

Royce doesn’t talk He listens
And then he’s moving again
Cuchillo emerges out of the bushes Surveys the new arrivals

CUCHILLO
Can someone fucking tell me what
the fuck is going on

ISABELLE
(keying on the same thing
Royce did)
Water

She starts after Royce

MOMBASA
I said I’m going to cut his throat

Nikolai ignores him follows Cuchillo is not far behind

Mombasa looks after Realizes the futility of his threat
Shoves Stans aside
Mombasa Stans Looks exchanged The kind that promise “this
isn’t over”

Mombasa strides off in the same direction Stans backstabs
him with a glare Weighs his options Trails after

We linger on the now empty clearing

A figure steps out of the bushes Has been there the entire
time Name’s HANZO Japanese slender dark suit white
shirt Beretta 92FS in a worn shoulder holster Look closer
and you’ll see he’s missing two finger tips on his left hand

Considers Walks after the others

SQUISH his dress shoes sink into mud

Hanzo -- utterly undeterred -- takes them off Then the
socks Lays down the items neatly on the ground Resumes the

journey

We stay on the shoes

EXT CREEK - DAY
Royce pushes through the foliage Stops

A shallow creek runs in front of him To the right sitting
on a rock his back toward Royce is a small unassuming man
Caucasian glasses beige slacks white T

This is EDWIN

He stares at the water with the wonder and innocence of a
child Turns taking in Royce and the others

A trickle of blood travels slowly along the side of his face

EDWIN
This is not where I was before

ISABELLE
Youre bleeding

Edwin’s fingers come away red and wet He studies them
absentmindedly

EDWIN
Oh that It’s not mine
“Creepy” doesn’t even begin to scratch the surface
Royce takes the reigns To all

ROYCE
Last thing you remember

NIKOLAI
War

Mombasa nods Same here
CUCHILLO
I was working And then

everything just

STANS
Stopped

We pan across their faces

ISABELLE
-What the hell happened to us

On Stans A thought forming Doesn’t happen often

STANS
Waaait You don’t mean we could
be dead

That gives everyone pause Obviously a possibility they
haven’t considered Stans begins to freak out

STANS
Holy shit I’m dead aren’t I I’m
dead and this is hell

ISABELLE
Last I checked you didn’t need a
parachute to get there

Good point Still

NIKOLAI
Why put us here
ISABELLE
How do I even know “here” exists
Maybe I’m lying in a hospital ina
coma And this all this is just
some bad dream

MOMBASA
(with conviction)
I’m real That fall was real
(clutching his AK-47)
This is real

CUCHILLO
Maybe we pissed off the wrong
people Maybe this is punishment

STANS
Where I come from you piss someone
off they stick a shiv in your
back Not dump you in the middle of
a jungle

NIKOLAI
A test then See how we do under
pressure That’s why they armed us

Royce’s attention is elsewhere

A leaf in his hand Water in it A small sliver of metal
floats on a smaller leaf A makeshift compass

The metal-bearing leaf spins madly refusing to settle

EDWIN
Some kind of psychotropic compound

Hanzo drifts out of the bushes Sidelines A silent nod
They take him in That dreaded question again

CUCHILLO
What the hell happened to us

On Royce He’s heard enough

ROYCE
It doesn’t matter It happened

They look toward him eager for solutions for answers for
something anything to make sense again Brass tacks

ROYCE
Water means life There might be a
camp or a village down stream

They move down the creek Together For the moment

EXT STREAM - DAY

Sun beats down without mercy The stream -- wider now -- runs
to the left as Royce on point hacks a path through lush
vegetation with even surgeon-like strokes

The rest of the crew is spread out behind him

All around them a jungle labyrinth towering and vast
SOUNDS shadows the sense of something just outside of our
field of vision

Something dangerous

Stans keeps glancing up hunched over uncomfortable as if
feeling the weight of the open space on his shoulders

STANS
(to Royce)
So where’s this village
No response
STANS
Hey I’m talking to you Where’s
the fucking village
Royce waves toward the jungle
ROYCE
That way Twenty klicks You should
start now

Stans bristles stalks away

NIKOLAI
What’s up with him

CUCHILLO
Freedom

Off Nikolai’s puzzled look speaking from experience

CUCHILLO
Take a monkey out of the cage
it’ll miss the bars

Close on a blooming plant Others pass it Isabelle pauses
for a look taken by its structure

Its pedals are bright delicate almost hypnotic in their
appearance She reaches out to touch them

Edwin’s hand intercepts hers

EDWIN
I wouldn’t do that

She recoils from his touch

Edwin smiles used to the effect Flicks out a surgical
scalpel Gingerly extends it toward--

SNAP the pedals close around the blade like a bear trap
EDWIN
(a hint of admiration)

Archaefructus liaoningensis Very
poisonous

He withdraws the scalpel Yellow pus drips off the steel
EDWIN
Very deadly All it would take is

one scratch

A clarification

EDWIN
I read a lot (beat) Strange
though

ISABELLE

How’s that

EDWIN
They have been extinct since the
early Cretaceous period 125
million years ago

Another mystery They shake it off Keep walking

EXT STREAM —- DAY

It becomes a river They follow its course

EXT RIVER —- DAY

From high above our guys look like ants crawling along a thin
blue thread Nothing but jungle in all directions

EXT RIVER BANK —- DAY

Royce appears in the distance heading toward us Suddenly
stops eyes on the ground Isabelle notes his concern

ISABELLE
What is it

ROYCE
Tracks

Faint outlines you and I would miss Royce kneels by them

CUCHILLO
So

ROYCE
So I’ve never seen them before

He touches the ground trying to determine what creature
could have made them Almost to himself

ROYCE
-Fresh

CUCHILLO
What are you Some kind of hunter

ROYCE
Some kind

CUCHILLO
Like lions tigers and shit

Royce rises Looks him square in the eye

ROYCE
No Like you

He resumes the trek

Hanzo is last Leans over the current Splashes some H20 on
his face

HIS POV obscured by the dripping water Jungle across the
river Something moves Quick Like a spectre And then it’s

gone

Hanzo stares Off his expression

EXT RIVER BANK — AFTERNOON

Light’s dimmer now Sounds seem louder and closer And more
malevolent

Aching muscles Sweat stains The journey is taking its toll
and it shows The crew is taking a brief respite

Cuchillo eyes the muddy stream

CUCHILLO
Think it’s safe to drink

NIKOLAT
You find out You let me know

Mombasa pulls down a thick vine THWACK severs it with his
knife A trickle of water emerges He drinks

Beat They rush to follow his example guzzle greedily

Stans watches Isabelle The predatory gleam in his gaze
promises nothing but trouble

She feels his eyes on her Turns

Stans grins

She doesn’t If looks could kill Stans would be a dead man
Gradually Stans’s smirk curdles like milk He looks away

Isabelle settles down next to Royce PUSH IN on them
forsaking the others

ISABELLE
You got a name

Royce looks at her for a beat

ROYCE
-Royce

ISABELLE
Isabelle So What do you think

He shrugs In his POV panning over the faces of their
companions reading them like a coloring book

ROYCE
Spetsnaz Alpha Group Los Zeta
cartel enforcer RUF Sierra Leone
death squad Yakuza Inagawa-kai
Former FBI’s Most Wanted

Settling on Edwin who’s raptly examining a beautiful monarch
butterfly that’s landed on his arm

ROYCE
That

Finally returning to Isabelle A nod toward the sniper rifle
ROYCE
And you (beat) I’d say we were
chosen

Silence It hangs there Like a noose

ISABELLE
Chosen for what

BOOOOODNDODNDNDDDOODDOONONODDODNOOONONODDONDNOOOOOOOO00O00000000M
Sonic boom CRASHES over the clearing like a tsunami
Something large streaks overhead too fast to make out

Earth SHAKES Bushes compress Our crew is knocked down ass
over teacups

And then it’s gone just as suddenly as it appeared a path
of destruction visible through the jungle

The tumult fades They dust themselves off Shaken but
unhurt

MOMBASA
Aircraft

NIKOLAI
Had to be military And that low
it would be landing someplace
close

They trade glances For the first time there’s something new
in their eyes shining through grime and exhaustion Hope

No words are exchanged They move into the jungle following
the trail

We linger on the now empty campsite

The monarch butterfly writhes in the dirt trying to take
flight In vain Its wings have been pulled off

EXT JUNGLE - AFTERNOON

On the road again The jungle seems denser more
impenetrable as if it’s determined to stop our heroes
EXT RAVINE - AFTERNOON

View from the trees looking down as the crew approaches
They descend into a ravine Slow treacherous going
Mombasa’s foot snags something He trips falls

Stans brushes past Grins

STANS
Looking good there boss

A massive tree trunk suspended by vines SWINGS toward him
like a fist of God

He rolls out of the way barely
The others scatter tripping more wires in the process
WHOOSH WHOOSH WHOOSH three makeshift spears spin toward

them from as many directions pincushioning foliage and
earth

Cuchillo dodges one only to trigger the next trap -- a
branch adorned with carved spikes It LASHES OUT

They duck the thing passing INCHES above their heads

Isabelle rushes forward trying to get out of the kill zone
Inexplicably PLUNGES straight through the ground--

Into a camouflaged pit Catches its edge Hangs there
literally clinging to life by her fingernails

A row of razor sharp Punji sticks await at the bottom
Battling gravity Losing Her hold gives
Royce catches her Reels her back in

They freeze eyes and barrels searching for targets Await
the next attack

Silence None seems forthcoming

Isabelle raises the rifle trying to control her breathing
HER POV Scanning scanning snapping back toward--

A glint of something

ISABELLE
Three o’clock 110 yards

Royce is already in motion Vanishes into the bushes

The rest spread out follow

EXT JUNGLE

With Royce moving fast soundless light He’s at his best
now -- alone

EXT RIDGE

He crests a small ridge Stops Stares We spin around using
Royce as a pivot revealing the object of his attention

A CORPSE

Desert fatigues dirty and torn to shreds Chest cavity like
an inward implosion fused cauterized a gaping wound Eyes

open Staring upward Into nothingness

The rest of the crew converge breathing ragged
up on adrenaline Take in the eerie sight

MOMBASA
We tripped a dead man’s trap

ROYCE
Two days Maybe three

Cuchillo crosses himself a reflex

still jacked

Nikolai leans over the body Sizes him up in a glance

NIKOLAI
Navy SEAL

Checks his pockets quick efficient a pro Maps Foreign

currency Papers His face registers confusion

NIKOLAI
He’s supposed to deployed in
Afghanistan

STANS
Just doesn’t make sense What was
he doing setting traps for us

ROYCE
He wasn’t He was hunting something
else Something a lot bigger

All eyes on him

ROYCE
The trunk was a deadfall trap Rule
of thumb the weight is at least
five times heavier than that of the
target animal

STANS
So what’s the animal

ROYCE
No idea But whatever it was it
came through the trip wires And
did this to him

He points to the SEAL’s decimated chest

EDWIN
What kind of a weapon does this

This time there’s no answer

CUCHILLO
We should bury him

ROYCE
(cold)
Why He’s dead

He strides away

Nikolai takes off his jacket Covers the corpse Soldier to
soldier

One by one they trail off Mombasa is last Suddenly stops

Slowly he turns back Freezes staring into the jungle As if
sensing something within its depths

Something he can’t name or see Watching Waiting

A shimmer in the foreground Like a heat wave dancing off the
pavement of a desert highway

A branch sways Except there’s no wind

ROYCE (0S)
What is it

Mombasa is jerked back to reality Eyes on Royce pupils
dilated a man snapping out of a trance

ROYCE
What did you see

MOMBASA
-Nothing

He moves on Royce looks after Then follows

EXT JUNGLE - AFTERNOON

The crew is on edge alert aware of every sound every step
every second Jungle envelops them from all directions
prehistoric stark keeping its secrets

Isabelle sidelines Royce

ISABELLE
Back there Thank you

ROYCE
(simple and direct)
You’re wrong about me

ISABELLE
How’s that

ROYCE
You think I’m a decent guy who’1ll
be there for you when push comes to
shove I’m not And I won’t be I
didn’t save you I just needed
another gun

She nods accepting the terms They keep moving Drift off
them to--

Cuchillo clutches a rosary lips moving in a silent prayer

NIKOLAI
You’re wasting your breath

CUCHILLO
We all have to believe in
something Even the worst of us
Perhaps the worst most of all

Motion in the bushes They react--

SOMETHING takes flight swoops over their heads SCREECHES
vanishes in the distance Whew

Stans begins to unravel

STANS
The fuck was that

Looking around panic building

STANS
I want a gun Someone give me a
fucking gun

No volunteers

Abruptly Stans lunges Shiv at Mombasa’s throat drawing
blood

STANS
Gun Now

He might as well be holding a feather duster

MOMBASA
I’m ready to die Are you

CLICK That was Mombasa’s 45 Hammer cocked Pointed at
Stans’s heart

A standoff
SUDDENLY--

An eerie SILENCE descends like a fast falling curtain Even
the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects have CEASED

They read it Weapons snap up Stans and Mombasa disengage
Trade glares Another time

White knuckle tension Seconds feel like an eternity

They hear it before they see it A low growling SOUND The
kind that makes your skin crawl

EXT JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE

A POV of something CRASHING through jungle at speed SNAPPING
branches like twigs Deep heavy panting Whatever it is
it’s fast Powerful And lethal

EXT JUNGLE

Royce CLICKS off the safety on his AA-12 shotgun

Isabelle RACKS the bolt of her rifle

Cuchillo PULLS the slides of his Uzis

Nikolai’s chaingun begins to WHIR

They wait Louder Closer

EXT JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE

The thing’s POV again Human forms ahead

EXT JUNGLE

Closer
A blur of motion to the left A shape -- large lean four
legs leathery skin -- LAUNCHES out of bushes changing

colors chameleon-like

A cross between a tiger a boar and your worst nightmare
Royce OPENS UP Short accurate bursts Mombasa UNLEASHES
with the AK Hanzo -- three point stance steady rate of
fire as if he was at a pistol range Cuchillo’s Uzis BLAZE
All of the above is muted by the ROAR of Nikolai’s chaingun
Its barrel spits out a foot of flame Stream of high velocity
rounds -- every fifth a tracer -- digs into the creature

It SQUEALS as bullets tear it apart A geyser of black blood
Still it crawls toward them barbed tail lashing
spastically

Nikolai - fuck me -- keeps firing

Finally the monstrosity halts Marks its killers with crimson
eyes as the light in them dims and expires

More are coming Could be three could be six Hard to tell
They are swift vicious closing in from three directions

Our crew -- fight or flee -- flee it is -- retreat toward the
only avenue of the escape laying cover fire re-painting
green with black

Still they come

Stans’s had enough breaks vanishes into the jungle

A thing LUNGES for Isabelle baring rows of jagged teeth

She tracks it taking her time and

BAM A 30 Magnum hollow point BLOWS its head apart mid-air
Black mist

It lands digging a furrow that ends at her feet

ISABELLE
Run

She moves pulling Edwin Another hellhound gives chase

The rest of the crew spread out Every man for himself

EXT JUNGLE

With Hanzo running pushing through thick foliage
Movement ahead

He swings at--

Royce his own gun lined on Hanzo

Split second relief

Instantly they shift aim as one of the beasts appears
Both FIRE CLICK Royce runs dry

It hears the sound knows what it means heads for Royce
even though Hanzo is closer

10 feet Royce dumps the gun

5 He draws a machete

Almost on top of him Leaps--

Royce drops under its attack blade held high

The monster sails over him WHACK its momentum splits it
open from stem to sternum

Black blood drips off cold steel

EXT JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE

Stans sprints branches SLASHING his face and hands Way past
giving a shit Glances back

Foliage RIPPLES behind him A shape closing fast
ITS POV Stans Breathing amplified distorted

Stans pours everything he’s got left in the tank into a
hundred yard dash Checks his tail again

Nothing there

He has a split second to contemplate his luck before--

WHAM the thing hits him bodily from the front

They roll kicking up leaves and dirt

Jaws SNAP He pushes against the beast’s neck with one hand
keeping fangs at bay Drives the shiv into its side with the

other Over and over again With every stab

STANS
Fuck you Fuck you FUCK YOU

Black blood spatters his jumpsuit

He SCREAMS as the creature digs its claws into his shoulder
ripping flesh Keeps stabbing

Primal Brutal Two animals The only question who’ll kill
the other first

The thing finally overpowers Stans Angles for his throat

WHAM a boot SMASHES against its head forcing it to the
ground Barrel to the ear BOOM

Silence The monstrosity twitches colors shifting fearsome
even near death

Stans looks up Mombasa looms over

MOMBASA
Looking good there boss

EXT TREE
Isabelle slings the rifle push-pulls Edwin toward a tree

ISABELLE
Climb

He does She’s a step behind And not a moment too soon

A hellhound EXPLODES into view as if born out of the jungle
itself Tears off a piece of her boot

She grabs a branch UNLOADS with the handgun Full clip
Slugs tear into the thing’s head bounce off the skull
leaving bloody grooves Don’t improve its looks Nor do they
stop it

EXT JUNGLE

Two more beeline toward Royce and Hanzo

EXT TREE

The monster coils Vertical leap Yanks Isabelle off

She falls Lies there dazed

Slowly the demon approaches Teeth dripping saliva Death
incarnate

EXT JUNGLE

Royce grips the machete tighter Hanzo DRIVES in a fresh
clip Last stand

EXT TREE

Isabelle reaches for her fallen pistol

The beast lets her Just keeps advancing We’re close enough
to smell its wet carnivore stink feel its hot breath

She considers Points the gun at her own head About to pull
the trigger

A WHISTLE
High pitched piercing inhuman washes over them
The result is immediate and dramatic

The creature slides to a stop claws digging into dirt
Stares at Isabelle muscles quivering

And then just like that it turns and vanishes into the
jungle as swiftly as it appeared
EXT JUNGLE

The other two facing Royce and Hanzo retreat as well

EXT JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE

Nikolai -- breathing heavy -- his chain gun sweeps the area
seeking targets There are none

EXT JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE

Stans clutches his bleeding shoulder locks eyes with
Mombasa Unspoken question

MOMBASA
Any other day any other place

Pause
MOMBASA
But bad as you’re those things
whatever they are are worse

EXT JUNGLE - ELSEWHERE

Isabelle lowers the gun Her hand shakes It takes her a
supreme effort of will to steady it

SOUND She draws--
Then Mombasa and Stans

Royce and Hanzo approach from the other side

Finally Nikolai dragging a chewed up carcass behind them
Drops it THUD

Everyone’s too drained to speak Finally

MOMBASA
What the hell are these things

NIKOLAI
Mutants maybe Like after
Chernobyl

ISABELLE
They just left

ROYCE
(grim)

No The whistle They were called

They digest minds reeling Refusing to comprehend

STANS
What the hell are you saying Are
you saying these these things

are someone’s

ROYCE
Pets Bloodhounds maybe

Beat What comes next is a chilling observation even more
disturbing than the previous discovery

EDWIN
There are seven of us

Heads turn Indeed they seem to be one short Namely--

CUCHILLO (VO)
-Help me

They react

EXT CLEARING - AFTERNOON
The crew emerge Stop at the edge of a clearing

Cuchillo his back toward them head lolling to the side
sits slumped in the center of a barren swath of dead earth

NIKOLAI
Hey HEY You OK
CUCHILLO
(without turning)

Help me
Isabelle steps forward Royce’s hand stops her

ROYCE
It’s a trap

ISABELLE
You don’t know that

Royce picks up a rock Tosses it out into the field
It bounces once Twice

A SUDDEN blur of steel as something lashes out from beneath
the ground DICES THE STONE TO SMITHEREENS

A chilling bottomless beat Like standing on the edge of an
abyss And looking down

NIKOLAT
(quiet)
Wound one man Make him bleed Make
him suffer Make him call out for
help Then set a trap and kill
those who come

Disgusted with himself with the world a confession

NIKOLAT
I’ve done this

MOMBASA
--We all have

Pause

STANS
So we leave him right

Off their looks

STANS
I mean he’s done There’s nothing
we can do And whoever sent those
dog things he’s out there Right
For once Stans is right A confirmation

ROYCE
We leave him

He turns

ISABELLE
---IT can’t

Royce weighs the moment and her mettle

ROYCE
Then it’s on you

Angles back into the jungle One by one the others pull
away follow in silent agreement A decision they all have to
live with

We stay on Isabelle Her eyes Something welling behind them
Her entire being is wrecked with silent tension

Until

CUCHILLO (VO)
Help me

She snaps up the rifle aims FIRES all in one liquid move

EXT JUNGLE

The GUNSHOT washes over them A few react Royce doesn’t
Just puts one foot in front of the other

EXT CLEARING

Isabelle lowers the barrel

Cuchillo’s body is now on its side

She turns to leave

CUCHILLO (VO)
Help me

She SPINS back toward--
CUCHILLO (VO)
(almost a taunt)

Help me

On Isabelle She’s seen and dealt death on many occasions
Shes rarely been afraid

She is now

Hurries after the others

PREDATOR POV A view from above Everything in infrared but
sharper more focused than we’ve ever seen Isabelle recedes

in the distance

Panning to Cuchillo A pool of blood glows around the body
becoming more faint as it cools

And then a RATTLE Like rats scampering over broken glass

This is not your father’s Predator

EXT JUNGLE - AFTERNOON
Royce in the lead the rest trailing Isabelle at the rear

They push out of jungle Ten meters above a barren rocky
ridge line looms

They head toward it

EXT RIDGE - AFTERNOON

Slowly as if clawing his way out of the ground after being
buried alive Royce appears over the horizon

The others step up next to him All stare out at the view
before them silent their expressions unreadable

THEIR POV Sky as far as the eye can see Below it jungle
stretches out for miles in every direction

Beyond it visible in the great distance are massive
angular chunks of an alien planet floating in space A
dying shattered world

Kansas it ain’t

CUT TO

EXT CLEARING - AFTERNOON

On Cuchillo jerking upright His head swings around dead
eyes staring at us

A blade -- long sharp covered in strange runes -- touches
the crown of his head about to scalp him Off that

EXT RIDGE - AFTERNOON

The crew are spread out on the ridge exactly where we left
them

Only Stans faces us looking away from the alien landscape
as though by ignoring it it might somehow go away rocking
slowly back and forth muttering

STANS
This is not happening This is not
happening This is not happening

Edwin takes in the strangeness the grandeur of it all the
slightest hint of a smile creasing his features

Mombasa a few paces away Nikolai next to him both lost in
thought

Hanzo reloads his gun

Isabelle stares back in the direction of Cuchillo still
living the moment the kill the voice

And Royce alone apart an outcast among outcasts

STANS (CONTD)
What is this place
(loud now an explosion of
emotion fueled by fear)
What the hell is this place

No one answers Then
ROYCE
The dogs were flushing us He is
bait We’re being hunted
A grim beat as they process their probable fate Finally

MOMBASA
Now what

In response Royce points to a jungle matted hillock in the
distance

In its center breaking the tree line something vertical and
tall Something unnatural

ROYCE
There
EXT HUNTING CAMP - SUNSET

Deep shadows Dying sun -- burnt orange -- peeks through the
heavy jungle canopy Decides to stay out

The crew advances cautious ready to rumble ready for
anything Or so they think

CREAKING soft and steady Growing stronger as they approach
And then they see

HELL

A half dozen creatures skinned rotting all large all
alien and judging by their looks all dangerous hang by
their feet from a long horizontal pole CREAKING as they
sway in the breeze

On the ground next to the carcasses a flock of birds --
monstrous otherwordly carrion eaters -- feast on offal --
guts brains eyes organs There’s plenty of chow for
everyone but they fight anyway just for the hell of it

Hides are strung over rough wooden frames curing

A fire smolders sending up thin wisps of gray smoke

A collection of polished skulls -- many with spinal cords
still intact -- is displayed on tree stumps and stakes

These are hard dangerous men who’ve seen and done more than
their share of evil Still they stare transfixed their
faces descending into a state of abject horror and revulsion

All except one

Edwin’s gaze is akin to that of a man looking up at the
ceiling of the Sistine Chapel

ISABELLE
(a whisper)
What is this place

NIKOLAI
Hell

Edwin’s fingers run along a row of skinning knives crusted
with multi-colored blood Feeling their sharp edges

They pass a large pit its bottom lost to the shadows

Something big fast gunmetal grey SWOOPS by Nikolai making
the same SCREECHING sound they heard earlier in the jungle

They advance further

In the center of the camp a 150 feet high METALLIC TOTEM
POLE all barbs and blades covered in arcane hieroglyphics
rises out of the earth like an exclamation point

We can see that there is something attached to the other
side Just not what

With our crew Coming around for a look Then stopping cold
Pan off their stunned speechless faces toward--

Stretched out on the totem is a PREDATOR CRUCIFIED

It hangs helplessly head slumped making no sound past any
threshold of pain a man could endure Florescent green blood
glowing in the gathering twilight covers its many wounds
Its helmet is off armor stripped shoulder mount smashed and
dangling loosely off the shoulder

It’s dead Or close to it

At the base of the monument is a pile of discarded Predator
armor shattered weapons and cleaved skulls

Shock and awe without the bombs

STANS
What The Fuck

Mombasa mutters something in his native tongue No
translation required

Hanzo shakes his head incredulous unable to process
EDWIN
(softly)
Monsters are real

Isabelle takes a step back

Bumps into Royce Their eyes meet In them he sees
something Fear Confusion No Recognition

The Russian steps forward chaingun held out Slowly
carefully he pushes Predator’s head upward with its barrel
trying to get a better look

SUDDENLY

The thing’s bloodshot eyes snap open Mandibles flare It
ROARS Nikolai and everyone else jump back

STANS
Let’s get the fuck out of here

Nobody needs to be told twice They start backing away
The carrion birds EXPLODE into the sky

Guns swivel in their direction

Tense Sweat beading Hearts POUNDING Terror building
They see

MOMBASA (VO)
-Nothing

They relax

Mombasa doesn’t Eyes wide with confusion

MOMBASA
-That wasn’t me

With no warning--

A CLOAKED SPEAR -- visible only thanks to the red chalk
outline of Mombasas blood -- BURSTS out of his chest driven
right through him from behind

His blood paints Stans’s face

Mombasa’s finger depresses the trigger a dying reflex His
AK BELCHES lead on full auto

The other react panic FIRE

The fury of their weapons surges in the direction of the
attack riddling the camp and the jungle

Crucified Predator adds its ROAR to the CACOPHONY

There’s nothing to shoot at Not even the classic Predator
shape Just a faint shimmer

Firing stops They back away -- more of a herd than a unit

STANS
Where is it Where the fuck is it

Royce’s eyes pan looking for movement motion anything
Isabelle rifle up searching

Nikolai sweeps the chaingun in a wide arc back and forth
Nothing

Slowly Royce’s hand drops to one of the grenades clipped to
Mombasa’s harness

CLICK

That was the pin Royce heaves the explosive into space
Rapid throws three more spacing them around the camp ground
at regular intervals

Split second of calm before the storm

Then BOOM BOOMBOOMBOOM

A cloud of dirt and shrapnel tears through the air ina
concussive wave--

Washing over a fast moving form making it visible for a
brief moment

We don’t see much But we do see this
It Is Fucking Big Think Predator on steroids

Nikolai sees it UNLOADS on the thing with the chaingun the
ROAR of the weapon matched by his BATTLECRY

PREDATOR POV Bullets stream toward us in ghastly slow
motion Targeting system tracks each projectile reads their
telemetry locks on

And then the creature OPENS UP with a chaingun of its own

An ERUPTION of flame The thing is a monster Makes Nikolai’s
BFG look like a child’s toy

Human and Predator rounds COLLIDE mid-air CLATTER on the
ground Chaingun vs chaingun

Everyone else retreats seeking cover and distance

Nikolai stands his ground still ROARING barrel white hot
and smoking

CLICK he runs dry Hauls ass after the others
Predator keeps FIRING
They scatter as rounds tear by “Black Hawk Down” time

Isabelle aims at the muzzle flashes puts a round above them
It ricochets off some unseen metal

Bullets arc towards her Only the grace of God and a dead
tree save her She dives as branches and bark get
PULVERIZED Pinned down

Royce -- still in motion -- sees it -- shotgun on full auto

The monster reels from the barrage

A single drop of blood lands on the ground

Royce sees it

And then the thing turns its undivided attention toward him

He cuts behind a row of hanging carcasses Depleted uranium
slugs turn meat into charnel in his wake

Hands grab Isabelle Edwin’s He pulls her up hauls her
toward the tree line

EXT JUNGLE - SUNSET

With Royce sprinting as if hell itself was on his heels --
which in many ways it is -- others doing same as the
jungle’s literally SHREDDED behind them bushes
disintegrating leaves turning to pulp wood into splinters

To Royce’s left seen only in silhouette and for the briefest
of moments we catch a glimpse of an alien ship -- burnished
angular steel lethal sleek and intimidating

Everyone else is running blind stumbling falling picking
themselves up living from one breath to the next

RAT TAT TAT TAT TAT the slugs cut through the base of a
massive tree trunk like a scythe Timber

Its falling shadow eclipses our guys -- the arc of the
bullets swings toward them -- crushed or shot pick your
poison -- OH SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII--

The ground before them disappears and they

EXT CLIFF - SUNSET

DROP

Six bodies TUMBLE down a steep slope an avalanche of
flailing arms and legs SMASHING into stones and roots

weapons CLATTERING away a long painful way down

With Royce the world spinning An outcropping looms He
bounces off it goes airborne

Which is where the ride gets interesting

Hes falling falling something dark and foreboding
below coming up fast

IMPACT

EXT RIVER - SUNSET

Royce PLUNGES underwater Comes up in time to see Isabelle
and Edwin SPLASH behind him Stans careens in SCREAMING

All washed away fast

Nikolai descends Disappears Doesn’t come back up

EXT UNDERWATER
HITS bottom Current pulls him along raking over rocks
The weight of the chaingun holds him down drowning him

He thrashes trying to ditch the thing An exercise in
futility Lungs screaming for oxygen getting none

Suddenly a form appears out of the murk

HANZO

His knife slices through the chaingun’s harness Both men
shoot for the surface

EXT RIVER - SUNSET

Break it sucking air only to get swept away toward rapids
From the frying pan

EXT RAPIDS - SUNSET

Six heads bob in the river’s fury Still water ahead

They hit it Sucked down out of frame

EXT UNDERWATER

Edwin is pulled through some unseen vortex Isabelle behind
him

HER POV Edwin jerked to the left disappears Beat and she
sees where

An underwater tunnel dark and slimy like a path to hell

And she’s tumbling through it walls rotating around her
jagged rocks sand plants fish all a blur

An underwater rollercoaster -- nightmarish dizzying
claustrophobic Abruptly--

EXT RIVER - SUNSET

She pops back up Royce Hanzo The others

PREDATOR POV The crew -- glowing thermal shapes in churning
black water -- glide toward us And then inexplicably--

We are airborne circle over the prey then accelerate away
That same SCREECHING sound

That’s because we are seeing through the eyes of--
PREDATOR FALCON

Segmented wings barbed alloy a biomechanical meld of
machine and organic tissue Death from above

EXT RAVINE - SUNSET

Predator Falcon descends toward the ridge overlooking the
river Wings extend braking Settles on nothing Wings

retract Just sits there perched in mid air

Light distorts The air undulates shifts A form SHIMMERS
into view

We don’t get the money shot There’1ll be time for that later
Just a few glimpses from the back The rest mercifully is
covered in shadows One thing for sure

If Predators were frightening this thing is TERRIFYING

A familiar RATTLE

Meet BLACK SUPER PREDATOR

Twenty yards to his left a SECOND SUPER PREDATOR de-cloaks

Across the river and fifty yards downstream a THIRD

This is the hunting party

BLACK SUPER PREDATOR turns toward us

Under a ferocious almost tribal mask red eyes like a pair
of blood rubies burn with cold malevolence

EXT BEACH - SUNSET

Nikolai drags himself out of the current Collapses ina
shallow pool set by a white sand beach

Hanzo’s next Edwin Stans Heaving Drenched Alive

Isabelle’s fingers grasp rocks find purchase She pulls
herself in Suddenly a shadow looms over

ROYCE
Yanks her to her feet Hand on her throat Cold fury

ROYCE
You knew

ISABELLE
I don’t know what you’re--

ROYCE
Yes you do In that camp the way
you looked at that thing You knew
Others approach Stare

Her eyes search for support Find none

ROYCE
What the hell are they

Beat A long one

ISABELLE
We don’t have a name for what they
are Just a spook story you hear
around the campfire An urban
legend Alien Bogeyman

Trying to make sense of it herself

ISABELLE
‘87 Guatemala A rescue team went
into the jungle Spec ops

(MORE )

ISABELLE (contd)
High end Six men plus a CIA
liaison One made it out In his
debrief he said they came in
contact with something not of
this world He gave a detailed
description

ROYCE
(re her earlier reaction)
The thing on the totem

ISABELLE
Yes

ROYCE
What else

ISABELLE

It could see in infra red Heat
signatures He used mud to block
his That’s how he was able to beat
it It wore some kind of camouflage
that adjusted to ambient light
Made it nearly invisible in our
spectrum

ROYCE
What happened to the survivor

ISABELLE
No one believed him And then he
just disappeared
Morale of the story
ISABELLE
It hunted and killed his team One

by one
Everybody thinking the same thing

NIKOLAI
So what hunted it

They can feel hairs on the backs of their necks standing up

The sun -- a blood red orb -- sinks below the horizon Tidal
wave of shadows washes over drowning them
STANS
We should get going Now Right
fucking now

ROYCE
It wants you to run

Lets them process this

ROYCE
We wait here Survive the night
Tomorrow we go back

STANS
Back For what To save it the
walk

ROYCE

It had a ship

STANS
A ship A ship What are you gonna
do with that ship man Push the
start button Throw it in gear and
drive home

Becoming unglued

STANS
That thing fucked us seven ways to
Sunday You saw what it was doing
back there We’re gonna end up as
rugs and ashtrays We’re dead meat
We don’t have a fucking chance

ROYCE
(stone cold)
It bleeds

STANS
So what Look at us man we’re
bleeding too

Nail on the head

ROYCE
If it bleeds we can kill it

Beat

ISABELLE
What makes you think you can fly
the ship

ROYCE

I can’t But that thing hanging on
the pole might

Looks exchanged The kind that say “you are fucking nuts”

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

Seen from afar Still A cliff wall peppered with small
caves looms in the distance

Moon and stars illuminate the jungle landscape muting its
hard edges

A SHRIEK in the distance We don’t even want to guess what
creature could have made it let alone meet it in person

An insect scurries along A leathery tongue shoots into
frame grabs it snaps back like a rubber band inside the
mouth of something resembling an oversized tree frog

It chews on the catch A bird swoops devours the amphibian
whole mid-meal

Survival of the fittest

We travel upward Toward the tree tops Different predators
Different prey

EXT TREES

A form manifests in the foliage Hanzo twenty feet off the
ground rests in the crook formed by trunk and limb

Stans is perched on another tree

Edwin across from him scrapes moss off the tree onto a
leaf Waiting for dawn

Isabelle clutches the stock of her rifle Stares out into the
alien jungle beyond Her mind elsewhere

Royce Eyes closed Asleep Or so we think

ROYCE
Cuchillo You did the right thing
But you wasted a bullet

She incinerates him with a glare

ISABELLE
I won’t make the same mistake with
you
Beat
ROYCE
What was his name The man you left
behind

She doesn’t answer He doesn’t expect her to Then
ISABELLE
What happened to you Royce What
made you so fucked up

He finally opens his eyes Every word every syllable of the
following bought and paid for in full

ROYCE
It’s always a jungle You’re either
predator Or prey

A hanging beat Neither one looks at the other Off that

EXT TREES - NIGHT - LATER

Isabelle nods off Snaps back to consciousness

HER POV A breeze sweeps through the jungle Branches RIPPLE
like the surface of a lake after a stone throw the effect
spreading into the distance Until it reaches--

One particular branch 250 yards out It doesn’t move

She reacts startled opens her mouth--

Royce’s hand wraps around it Shakes his head Lets go

Isabelle snaps up the rifle

HER POV Night vision The branch is already gone

She shakes her head Royce points

Deep in jungle the faintest sense of motion

She tracks it

HER POV A glimmer There one moment gone the next

CLICK she drops the safety Others hear it react tensing

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

Something fast and agile cuts into frame arcing left
Circling our guys

EXT TREES - NIGHT - LATER

In the trees everyone’s alert looking out in different
directions waiting for an attack

A bug lands on Stans’s neck He crushes it eyes never
leaving the jungle

Isabelle Glued to the scope A whisper

ISABELLE
Why isn’t it coming

ROYCE
It’s waiting

She glances at him Shakes her head She doesn’t have a shot
And they can’t sit here forever

Beat

Slowly Royce puts down his weapon Ammo Side arm Lightening
the load

Isabelle Royce Reading one another

ROYCE
Don’t miss

SMASH TO

EXT JUNGLEEXT TREE - NIGHT - INTERCUT
On Royce -- running

Fifty yards to his left a blur moving parallel matching
pace

Royce keeps running leaping logs ducking low branches
ISABELLE’S POV Royce sprinting Rapid shifts to his
pursuer Now forty yards out and closing Two trains on a
collision course

Back to Royce He angles left

The hunter adjusts accordingly

ISABELLE’S POV Its form -- still largely unseen -- strobes
through the bushes Too fast to draw a bead on

Royce -- he can hear it approaching -- still he never looks
back never skips a beat -- just hauls ass
Eight yards out Six

Isabelle’s finger tenses on the trigger

HER POV Four yards Two
Royce -- the creature almost upon him
Talons -- long black jagged -- SLASH

BANG Thing’s blown off to the side and out of frame
Royce drops to the ground exhausted

Isabelle lowers the rifle her expression unreadable

EXT JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Royce stands over the slain monster doubled over sucking
wind The others approach

STANS
Is it dead

Royce manages a nod

STANS
When why the fuck aren’t you
smiling
Royce motions over his shoulder toward the body

We finally get a good look

The creature resembles a stick bug multi-jointed limbs
protruding from its exoskeleton carapace covered in sharp
bone blades Definitely not a Predator More importantly

A harness stretches over its chest In the center a broken
altimeter

STANS
(fuck me)
--It’s one of us

Isabelle approaches

ROYCE
Good shot anyway

She ignores him Checks the tree trunk next to the corpse
A ragged hole in it The confirmation she needed

ISABELLE
I missed

OH SHIT

They react -- sitting ducks -- can practically feel another
incoming round screaming toward them

Instead a low quiet rasp

VOICE
Over here
They spin toward it
Nothing
Behind them now
VOICE

Over here

Everyone save Royce reflexively swings that way
Royce -- fool me once -- stays put eyes panning slowly
The tip of a burnished barrel brushes his ear

He turns Finds himself facing the business end of a long
rifle Only alien and much more badass

At its terminus jungle And two eyes

VOICE
What are you

ROYCE
Fucked How about you

Beat
The barrel pulls away

Jungle seems to shift A camouflaged form composed of leaves
and vines steps forward The ultimate Ghillie suit The kind
that hunters wear to blend into their surroundings

Its hood is pulled back to reveal--

NOLAND 60’s Hard open face battered by elements and age
Scars Burn marks It’s not the years it’s the mileage

NOLAND
Alive

Takes in our crew Doesn’t like what he sees His voice has
the cadence of a man who hasnt used it in a very long time

NOLAND
And youre sloppy Ive been
hearing you for six hours
Smelling you for eight And if I
can so can they
(beat)
It’s going to rain soon

Starts to walk away

ISABELLE
Wait

Off his look

ISABELLE
Who are you

The sound of his own name seems almost unfamiliar to him

NOLAND
My name is Noland

He strides back into the jungle Our crew trade glances
Wisely decide to follow
EXT CLIFF - NIGHT

High stone walls loom Noland heads for them moving with the
practiced precision of a seasoned hunter

An odd sight ahead stops them in their tracks

Three Predator skeletons -- ancient bones bleached rib
cages pulverized skulls shattered -- lie on the ground

The forth is fused with a Super Predator skeleton blades --
not even a speck of rust even after all these centuries --
driven into one another locked in an eternal struggle

They take in the eerie tableau staggered by it

Noland just brushes past it He’s seen it all before

THUNDER CLAPS in the distance

Plants begin to close up Bulbs retract as thick fibrous
leaves wrap around them protectively Soon we’1ll know why

Noland picks up the pace To our crew

NOLAND
Hurry

Drops start to fall Sizzle on the skeletons
One hits Stans’s shoulder burns through fabric He YELPS

STANS
What the fuck

Make that acid rain Figures

Dead end ahead Noland marches toward it undeterred Rounds
an outcropping Pulls back a heavy camouflage net

Cave entrance behind it He disappears inside Our heroes
trail All save--

Edwin Frozen Something in his expression we haven’t seen
since we’ve met him Terror

EDWIN
I have an issue with small
spaces

ROYCE

Deal with it
Edwin tries Cant
Shaking on the verge of hyperventilating -- his creepy calm
veneer cracking like ice -- at the moment he’s nothing but a

stranger in a strange land stranded scared pathetic

More drops fall The ground smolders If Edwin stays outside
he’s toast

Isabelle takes pity Steps back out

ISABELLE
Look at me Look at me

He does Deer in the headlights
ISABELLE
We’re going to do this together
Take my hand Keep moving One foot
in front of the other

Slowly and with supreme effort Edwin complies

ISABELLE
Good You’re doing good

They enter--
INT PASSAGE - NIGHT

Nikolai pulls a Claymore from his pack Plants it about to
string a trip wire

NOLAND
Don’t They’re smart Too smart for
that

He moves off into darkness Clearly knows every inch of this
place The passage continues ahead curving to the left

Noland pushes up against a wall A hatch opens up

INT NOLANDS CAVE

Isabelle and Edwin are last to arrive Noland pulls a heavy
trap door closed behind them secures it with alloy rods

Turns up a dial on some strange device Light washes over
illuminating--

The space is large and spartan Thee hatch A cot next to it
Makeshift table and bench Hard living

Everywhere bits and pieces of gear some man made most
alien A scavengers den

Noland puts down the rifle As he peels off his Ghillie suit

NOLAND
They drop you in

Royce nods

NOLAND
Hell of a rush huh

An armored plate beneath it Think alien Kevlar Stans eyes
it greedy envious KNOCKS on it liking the sound

STANS
Where did you get that

NOLAND
Off the guy who didn’t need it
anymore Don’t touch my stuff

Another suit under the plate this one made out of the hide
of some creature Off their looks

NOLAND
Blocks the body heat Can’t hunt
what you can’t see

ISABELLE
How long have you been here

Noland motions to a wall
Thousands of lines carved into stone Thousands of days

NIKOLAI
Jesus

NOLAND
Don’t see much of him around here
We win the war

NIKOLAI
Iraq

NOLAND
Vietnam

Nikolai shakes his head

NOLAND
Figured we wouldnt Victorys in
the mind We lost before we even
went in

EDWIN
How did you survive this long

NOLAND
Being smart Keeping my head down
Salvaging what I can when I can
from whatever I can Making sure
they don’t know where I am You
want food

EDWIN
I could eat

Noland nods to an earthen bowl Edwin peeks inside Looses
his appetite very quickly

NOLAND
Id tell you it tastes like
chicken Except I dont remember
what chicken tastes like But you
can live on it
All ears

NIKOLAI
What is this place

NOLAND
Far as I can tell a game preserve
And you and I are the game

ROYCE
They stock it

NOLAND
Thats right Youre lucky Most
humans don’t make it this far

ISABELLE
So all this is just for sport

NOLAND
I didnt say that

NOLAND
Every year they bring in the fresh
meat Shit you wouldn’t even
believe They hunt ‘em Kill ‘em
But every so often one of us kills
one of them That’s when they get
real interested Slice the poor son
of a bitch up See what makes him
tick Next season when they are
back maybe their weapons have
changed or maybe their armor
Maybe even them

They trade glances

ROYCE
How do we stop them

NOLAND
You dont

ROYCE
Theyve got to have a weakness

NOLAND
Some ones we got ‘cept what kills
us just hurts them

(MORE )

NOLAND (contd)
(shakes his head)
I’m going to bed No loud noises
Theyre out there

EDWIN
How do you know

NOLAND
(matter of fact)
Because theyre always out there

INT NOLANDS CAVE - LATER

Times passed Lights are low Nolands asleep on his cot
The crew is arrayed around the cave Nowhere to go Nothing
to do Just time to kill And ponder

Hanzo’s eyes take in a pile of weapons in the corner Some
we recognize -- a pump action ten gauge a katana a CAR-15
a flare gun Dirty Harry’s Magnum Some whose origins we can
only imagine

Hanzo picks up the katana Studies it with reverence Pulls
the blade half way out of the scabbard

His eyes are reflected in the steel

HANZO
This is old Very old

They react both to the statement and the fact that he’s
finally broken his silence

ROYCE
They’ve been doing this for a long
time

NIKOLAI

You speak English

HANZO
Yes

STANS
So why didn’t you say something

Hanzo lifts up his diminished hand

HANZO
(indicating the missing
fingers)
Because I talked too much

Nikolai laughs Not a sound you hear often in this place
Stans chuckles as well To Edwin

STANS
So what’s your story white bread

EDWIN
I don’t have one

STANS
Everybody’s got a story

EDWIN
I sell life insurance

STANS
Yeah How about you write me a
policy

He chuckles Edwin doesn’t

EDWIN
I’m afraid that would be a poor
investment

STANS
Why is that

EDWIN
(same flat monotone)
Because we’re all going to die

Stans’s smile fades
Isabelle and Royce in the far corner apart from the rest

ISABELLE
Hes right

ROYCE
Not me I’m going home

ISABEL
What’s that

ROYCE

ISABEL
Anyone waiting for you there
Anyone who was sad to see you go in
the first place Anyone at all

He doesn’t respond She doesn’t expect him A reversal

ISABELLE
Do you know what I was doing when I
was taken The things I have done
Do you have any idea

ROYCE
You did what you had to do

ISABELLE
I used to believe that I used to
believe a lot of things (beat)
The trouble with the end justifying
the means is that sometimes you get
to the end and wonder if it was
worth it And what it was all for

Eyes full of pain

ISABELLE
You said we were chosen I asked
for what I should have asked why

Midnight of the soul

ISABELLE

It’s because we are predators
Royce Just like them And going

home isn’t going to change that

Off their reactions

EDWIN
Hes a scavenger What he can when
he can from whatever he can Or
whomever He wants what we have

As a confirmation smoke -- grey-green and thick -- begins to
pour in through holes in the floor FUBAR

They react Some try to cover their mouths Others attempt to
plug the vents Both plans appear futile

Royce -- spur of the movement -- JACKS in a green shell into
his shotgun

They keep going blind slipping down the slime covered
incline into--

Plasma round SCORCHES Nikolai sends him sprawling
Isabelle spins toward him
Nikolai -- on the ground hurt bad -- eye contact
ROYCE
(to Isabelle)
Come on
Nikolai simply shakes his head Then looks away

Royce grabs her She doesn’t move A thousand miles away

ROYCE
Come on damn it

She snaps back to reality Shoves Royce aside

ISABELLE
Don’t Fucking Touch me

Resumes running Royce follows Into the chimney they go

Nikolai remains Props himself up against the wall Clutches
his chest Waits

Super de-cloaks into view

Massive Armored Unblinking ruby red eyes burn under a
ghoulish death mask A walking nightmare

SNAP its wrist blade extend gleaming in low light
Wolverine would be jealous

Drives them into Nikolai’s mid-section Lifts the big man off
the ground like a rag doll

EYEBALL TO EYEBALL

Super studies Nikolai like a bug under a microscope Wanting
waiting for him to cry out To beg But all it gets is

NIKOLAI
(subtitled Russian)
You are one ugly mother

fucker
CLICK Super’s eyes snap down to Nikolai’s chest
Two Claymores And he just pulled the safeties

Nikolai starts to laugh -- eerily similar to Billy’s iconic
laugh in the original

INT CHIMNEY - NIGHT

With out guys shimming upward as--

World seems to convulse Rocks shift Chunks dislodge fall
Royce looks down

HIS POV Fireball blossoms from below moving toward them
with a concussive ROAR

He barely has time to pull himself over an outcropping and
press into a crevice before--

Flame WASHES OVER him -- a flash of fury heading for the
surface

And then it’s gone

Looking up Royce sees the others Smoldering Singed But
alive

They keep climbing We rise above them through the chimney
over the exit as--

Something STREAKS past the camera A familiar SCREECH

EXT PLATEAU - NIGHT
Royce reaches the surface Collapses

A barren plateau stretches out like an island of stone
surrounded by jungle on all sides

Almost in disbelief

STANS
We killed it
(realization dawning)
We fucking killed it

He peers down the chute Practically dancing a jig
STANS
Fuck you ET How do you like us
now motherfucker Huh Huh
Hunt this
He grabs his package

BOOM Plasma caster NAILS Stans in the back blowing him out
of frame Revealing--

Black Super Predator Finally unveiled in his full glory

Heavy jet black armor -- a hellish mix of medieval knight and
samurai -- envelops its hulking frame like the Grim Reapers
shroud

Desiccated remains of its victims hang around its neck and
belt

A triple headed plasma caster rests on its mount Cruelly
curved blades at the elbows Spikes on shoulders knees and
heels Even its dreadlocks are weapons each strand ending
with a razor-sharp tip weaved into the hair

That same chilling RATTLE again

Laser sight extends painting Royce’s forehead

On Royce Resigned Ready No sign of fear

BLACK’S POV Royce in infrared A mass of color Keying in
on his beating heart Measuring its steady rate

ROYCE’S POV Nothing so fancy Taking in the monstrosity
before him Giving it nothing An eye fuck

Game over in 3-2-

WHAM Stans -- not quite as dead as we figured -- LEAPS on it
from behind PLUNGES his shiv into the thing’s neck

Black’s turn to suffer Round intended for Royce goes wild

Stans -- his back a scorched bloody mess Noland’s alien
Kevlar exposed under the shredded fabric of his prison
jumpsuit -- a hole through the armored plate but it bought
him the next few precious seconds of life -- hangs on to
Black like a pitbull stabbing punching slashing ROARING

We finally see why he was chosen He’s a fucking animal

STANS
(to the others)
Go GO
They run for it
Black -- its own ROAR drowns Stans’s -- DRIVES a bladed elbow

into his side WHAM WHAM Its plasma caster SWIVELS
tracking the fugitives

Stans -- bleeding dying fuck you he eats that for
breakfast -- grabs the shoulder mount twists it the other
way pointing the barrel toward the fucker’s head

Black -- can’t fire without blowing its own brains -- re-
focuses his attention on Stans WHAM WHAM WHAM

Finally Stans expires still clinging on to his opponent
even in death
EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

What’s left of our crew -- Royce Isabelle Hanzo Edwin --
keep moving

EXT PLATEAU - NIGHT
Stans’s body HITS the ground

Black Super Predator looms over Levels its heavy gaze on the
jungle

Another Super SHIMMERS into view alongside him Locks in on
the same direction

Black BELLOWS

It’s the cry of a hunter Stirring fear in the heart of its
prey

And then the two creatures move fast efficient strides
heading after their prey fading to invisibility

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

The screen is a microcosm of leaf crystal drops of
precipitation refracting the moonlight stone and emerald
green moss We hear the JUNGLE Some distant BIRDS HUM of
insects The whisper of the WIND

Royce -- a flash -- streaks into frame Disturbing no leaves
breaking no branches making no sound Isabelle and Edwin
behind him Hanzo trailing

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

Same spot Distant RUSTLING It gets closer and louder

We don’t see Black Super Predator We can only feel its
passage by the vibration of the drops As they fall--

EXT JUNGLE - NIGHT

A forty yard sheet of rocks Royce leaps onto it keeps
running

EXT JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

Black Super Predator SHIMMERS into view Scans the area with

the clinical detachment of a crime scene forensic Shifts its
gaze toward the ground

BLACK SUPER PREDATOR’S POV Tracks end at the stretch of
rock Exponential magnification in rapid snaps Times 4 8
16 32 Depressions in the stone Deviations in topography
“Enemy Of The State” time

But no good track Which is exactly what Royce intended
Undeterred Black CYCLES through different vision modes like
a camera changing lenses Ultraviolet Terahertz Gamma
Finally settles on--

Chemical sensor Our heroes’ scent still lingers in the air
in the form of their distorted silhouettes It’s like looking
back in time and seeing a pheromone imprint left by the

person who occupied the space minutes ago

Black follows it fading back to invisibility certain as
death and taxes

We understand the game being played A duel of hunters
Technology against survival skills Terminator vs Rambo
EXT HUNTING CAMP - NIGHT

The totem rises over the jungle canopy in the distance

EXT SWAMP - NIGHT

Royce emerges out of bushes Swamp to the left Solid ground
to the right

Others stumble behind Sucking air Suffering the effects of
the run

Royce puts his ear to the ground The thing might be
invisible But it’s not immaterial And it is heavy

He can sense their pursuer approaching in the distance

Into the swamp they go Brackish foul smelling water rises
up to meet them

EXT SWAMP - MOMENTS LATER

BLACK’S POV Moving The pheromone trail lies before us like

an illuminated path Then nothing It just gets abruptly
erased mid-air overwhelmed by the stench of the swamp

Black RATTLES in frustration
ITS POV cycles back to infrared

Revealing the second Super standing a few feet away
invisible in the previous spectrum

A look between them Something passes
Second Super cuts into the swamp

Black skirts around it trying to outflank our guys A vise

EXT SWAMP - NIGHT

Royce and the others push through knee deep water going on
fumes and desperation

EXT SWAMP - NIGHT

SECOND SUPER’S POV Moving stopping Panning around Cycling
modes Nothing

As any hunter knows it’s impossible to track over water

MACRO CLOSE on the surface of the swamp Detecting
INFINITESIMAL RIPPLES reverberating from our heroes’ fading
footsteps Calculating the distance from the source

And then we are moving again

EXT SWAMP - NIGHT

With our crew running their feet SLASHING rhythmically
against the water

EXT SWAMP - SAME TIME

In Super’s POV following their wake

EXT SWAMP - NIGHT

Royce still on the move grabs a passing tree limb

EXT SWAMP - MOMENTS LATER

Splash Splash The Super seen only via the afore-mentioned
effect rushes through the same spot glued to the trail

Which is why it doesn’t see the vine stretched an inch above
the bottom An improvised trip wire Snags it--

WHAM the tree limb uncoils WHIPLASHES it into next week
SPLASH Something heavy tumbles into the swamp

Beat The creature climbs back on its feet blue sparks
coursing around its flickering form Cloak is on the fritz

Then gives out completely

Super PUSHES control panel buttons on its gauntlet No joy
Tries the vision modes Same

And then it HISSES like a pissed off cat

EXT EDGE OF THE SWAMP - NIGHT

Royce climbs out onto a muddy embankment others in tow
Ten yards out an ocean of tall grass Savannah They head
for it

EXT TALL GRASS - NIGHT

Everyone collapses exhausted beyond words For a while the
only sounds we hear are the wind and their ragged breathing
Then

ISABELLE
They’re running us down

HANZO
The more they chase us the weaker
we get

ROYCE
Persistence hunting Driving us to
exhaustion

Break’s over

EXT TALL GRASS

Star splattered sky Grass sways in the breeze

Four silhouettes seen from afar move through it

One STOPS

Royce glances back

Hanzo stands in the center of the clearing Tired of running
Looks at the survivors A simple nod

All they can do is keep going

Slowly meticulously Hanzo removes his shirt Folds it
neatly Lays down on the ground Just like the shoes

The body beneath covered in irezumi Full body Yakuza
tattoos Dragon Tiger Images of violence made somehow
beautiful through art

He unsheathes the katana Holds it loosely blade pointed
downward Takakura Ken style

He waits
Over his shoulder as Second Super approaches

Targeting beam triangulates Hanzo’s face Then drops downward
toward the tattoos

SUPER’S POV Data first on the man -- vital organs
musculoskeletal structure nervous system -- then on the
blade -- measurements chemical composition -- scrolls

Hanzo waits

The beam disappears

Slowly the Super unstraps its caster It THUDS on the ground
Walks towards Hanzo picking up pace as he goes

SNAP SNAP Twin WRIST BLADES -- acid etched alien steel
covered by glyphs and kill notches -- extend

Two master swordsmen from different sides of the galaxy

Super charges A freight train

Hanzo stands his ground

IMPACT Steel on steel Sparks fly A flurry of moves --
slashes stabs blocks and counterattacks -- too dazzling to
comprehend -- a dance of death a duel of equals

They disengage Circle Looking for openings

Suddenly lunge CLASH Swords LOCK GRIND along each other
The eyes of their owners are linked as well

Slivers of metal SHEER A shower of sparks

Super flexes its massive arms driving Hanzo back SLASH

A line of red wells across Hanzo’s shoulder

Super flicks off its opponent’s blood

Hanzo nods Switches his stance High guard

Super considers His own blade hangs low

Hanzo adjusts his grip Shifts his balance A coiled spring

SUPER’S POV Computer calculates Hanzo’s weight dispersal
Muscle tension Predicting where he’s going to strike next

They charge toward one another

A BLUR of steel as they pass SWISH SLASH
Then stop

Beat We can’t tell who got whom Until

Super gurgles black blood Slides apart split from shoulder
to thigh

Hanzo DRIVES his sword into the ground An echo of Kurosawa
His hand on the hilt Blood flows freely down the wrist
He looks up at the sky Collapses

A beautiful death

EXT JUNGLE

Royce cuts between leafy plants pushes into a small
clearing Three miles out the totem Nearing home stretch

A form glides into view Predator Falcon That same
SCREECHING sound again Noting Royce’s reaction

EDWIN
It’s just a bird is it

ROYCE
No it’s not

The master can’t be far behind

Royce casts about searching for an out Cover is sparse
They stay on the ground they’re dead

His gaze travels upward toward the jungle canopy Isabelle
tracks it Reacts Shit And she thought running was bad

ROYCE
Got a better idea

She doesn’t Edwin pales a bit

ISABELLE
Let me guess Heights

He nods Then tapping into some hidden reservoir a hint of
steel beneath his meek exterior

EDWIN
I know Deal with it

They begin to climb using branches vines outcroppings
anything they can for purchase

The Falcon continues to circle

We zero in on its eye Then PULL BACK Except we’re now--

EXT JUNGLE - SAME TIME
On the eye of its master Bird’s POV reflected in the pupil

Black can see what the Falcon sees A biomechanical link

EXT TREE

With our guys no safety lines pushing themselves upward
fighting for every inch and now it’s a race cause--

EXT JUNGLE

BLACK’S POV Knows exactly where they are and he’s hauling
ass

EXT TREE

Climbing The canopy looms above A shield of green We draw
toward it slowly but surely

EXT RIVER

BLACK’S POV Going flat out at punishing pace strong
effortless a machine

EXT TREES
At last they reach the top Royce looks down

Bushes RIPPLE as if a small tornado was passing through
them Closing rapidly on their position

Isabelle just below reacts to his expression

ISABELLE
Do I want to know

ROYCE
No You want to run

EXT TREE TOPS

That they do

A mad dash through an intricate latticework of tree limbs so
thick and intertwined they form a kind of hidden treacherous

catwalk broken up by gaps and crevices A vertigo-inducing
experience

As they pass we descend through the foliage streak toward
the ground below toward--

EXT JUNGLE

Black -- a shimmer -- fifty feet down and a hundred yards
behind -- relentless gaining

ITS POV Leaves obscure the view of the prey No matter

EXT TREE TOPS

The Falcon SWOOPS from above and we’re now in its POV with
our guys again sprinting struggling forward unaware that--
EXT JUNGLE

Black’s plasma caster WHIRS into motion

BLACK’S POV Aiming through the bird’s eyes Matching their
movements anticipating where they are going to be in the
split second it’1ll take the rounds to reach their marks

EXT TREE TOPS

The Falcon -- ahead of the quarry -- keeps a constant lock

EXT JUNGLE

Black Super -- has them dead to rights -- about to fire as--

EXT TREE TOPS
BAM BAM BAM Royce OPENS UP on the Falcon

It’s forced to evade Tracer rounds STREAK by

EXT JUNGLE

BOOM Black’s blast -- targeting lock disengaged -- misses
blowing chunks out of a tree

EXT TREE TOPS

The bird dips trying to recover coming around for another
pass

Royce keeps pouring rounds at it Keeps missing

It’s ducking weaving constantly changing altitude
impossible to hit

BOOM Another blast ERUPTS through the canopy closer now
The concussion knocks Royce back He loses the shotgun

It plummets below

FALCON’S POV target lock re-acquired

CRACK

Falcon -- a mid-air explosion of feathers and metal --
corkscrews into a tree like a shot down Messerschmitt

Bullseye

Isabelle lowers the smoking barrel

EXT JUNGLE

BLACK’S POV The link severed Everything goes black BELLOWS
in pain and rage

EXT TREE TOPS

Royce -- a simple nod to Isabelle -- keeps moving

EXT JUNGLE

BLACK’S POV Vision returning slowly Panning across the
canopy No sign of the prey

And then it really RATTLES

EXT JUNGLE - OTHER

Royce drops into frame descending from the tree Isabelle is
next Then Edwin

He takes two steps and--
THWACK
Edwin SCREAMS

A barbed vice -- an alien bear trap -- is locked onto his
ankle bronze alloy stained red

Isabelle rushes toward him Drops to her knees Strains to
pull the jaws open Cant

ISABELLE
Help me

Royce doesn’t move

She glares Continues to struggle Eventually they give just
enough for Edwin to pull his leg free He collapses

She examines the wound Edwin winces

ISABELLE
Hurts

EDWIN
Like hell

ISABELLE

Good Means there’s still blood
flowing Another quarter of an
inch and it would have hit your
femoral artery

EDWIN
Guess it’s my lucky day

ROYCE
It isn’t

He doesn’t even look at the wound He doesn’t have to

ROYCE
That trap wasn’t meant to kill
Just to maim

Cold hard truth Both barrels of it

ROYCE
Leave him

ISABELLE
Hang on just a fucking second

ROYCE
(to Edwin)
No offence But you’re dead weight

EDWIN
I can still walk

ROYCE
Not for long You’1ll get winded
quickly You’1ll say you don’t need
any help But sooner or later
youll start lagging behind
Eventually you won’t be able to
continue on your own We’1ll feel
bad We’ll carry you And then
you’ll drag us down with you

Beat Both know he’s right
Royce takes out his handgun Ejects the clip Leaving--

ROYCE
One round in the pipe That’s all
you need

He tosses the pistol to Edwin

Isabelle explodes the total tonnage of everything she’s been
through in the last 36 hours unleashing like a broken dam

ISABELLE
We can’t do this This isn’t right
This isn’t fucking right He’s one
of us

Royce’s calm matches her fury
ROYCE
Don’t you get it This is a trick
Do you think it would stop for one
of its own It wants your
compassion Your pity To feel
something for this man To be
human

Beat

ISABELLE
Then I guess I am What are you

ROYCE
(an echo of Noland’s line)
Alive
Brass tacks
ROYCE

-e-I’m not dying for him You want
to carry him it’s on you

Starts walking away

ISABELLE
Royce

He slows Turns Meaning every word
ISABELLE
You don’t belong here with us You
belong back there With them
Royce processes this
And then he’s gone consumed by jungle

Beat

EDWIN
You should have gone with him

ISABELLE
(simply)
I know

She grabs Edwin’s hand pulls him to his feet

WHOOSH

Something knocks them out of frame
A HEAVY ALLOY MASH NET
They lying on the ground wrapped in it like a cocoon

THEIR POV Black materializes Looms over Off that

EXT HUNTING CAMP - NIGHT
Moving through it

Shell casings litter the ground Trees pocked with bullet
holes Earth marred by grenade blasts A battle zone

Three remaining Predator hunting dogs lunge at the bars of
their cages foaming at the mouth choking on BARK like
vomit trying to get at someone just beyond their reach

Predator still hangs on the totem Snaps back to
consciousness

PREDATOR POV Royce standing before him Close Too close

Picks up an axe from a pile of discarded Predator weapons at
the thing’s feet Feels its weight in his hand

Beat

ROYCE
You understand me

Crucified Predator focuses on him with bloodshot eyes
ROYCE

I want out Off world There’s a

ship here Can you fly it
Crucified Predator studies Royce for a long beat
Then a nod
Slowly Royce raises the blade
THWACK He cuts the creature’s bond THWACK THWACK THWACK

Predator falls to the ground

Moment of truth

Predator rises to his feet Massive Imposing even despite
his injuries Or perhaps because of them

Royce stares at him tensing ready to fight and die
And then the thing ROARS

It is a cry ripped from the depths of its soul Fierce
Primitive Timeless

EXT JUNGLE

Isabelle and Edwin are DRAGGED along the jungle floor
Captives

The ROAR washes over them Birds SCREECH Animals HOWL It’s
as if the jungle itself is reacting to the creature’s call

Black’s head snaps toward the sound

INT SUPER PREDATOR SHIP

The space is dark and dormant as a crypt Bulkheads
Machinery Grates Spartan Efficient Lived in

CLOSE ON a Lexan panel A gauntlet covered Predator hand
glides along

Lights FLICKER on A WHIR emanates from somewhere deep inside
the ship’s core Grows stronger

Holographic display materializes

Star charts cycle through Finally settling on--

A familiar blue planet

It reflects in Royce’s eyes

Another panel flashes red insistent

A second hologram manifests Ground proximity sensors On it
three forms -- one massive two smaller entwined --
approaching

Predator hand reaches down Picks up the original old school

plasma caster resting on the floor Lowers it onto his
shoulder mount

Caster CLICKS into place SWIVELS GRINDS to a halt

Predator SLAMS his shoulder against a bulkhead Caster
swivels again this time clean even Malfunction fixed

Payback time

Predator -- fully armed fully armored a warrior restored to
his former glory -- pushes out toward the exit

Royce looks after

Predator exits the ship hitting a panel on his way out
The hell that is this planet is erased from view as the
bulkhead SEALS SHUT leaving Royce very much alone

EXT HUNTING CAMP - SAME TIME

Isabelle and Edwin lie next to the pit still wrapped in the
net Black’s foot pushes them in

We fall with them into--

EXT PIT

They land HARD

Isabelle cranes her neck looks up

The walls of the pit tower above her like a silent scream
Marked by claws talons and finger tracks of all shapes and
sizes -- a rainbow spatter of dried blood -- left by the many

pairs of frenzied limbs of those came before her

The earth RUMBLES Bits of rock and dirt tumble down

EXT HUNTING CAMP

A few skulls RATTLE

Black’s eyes snap toward them Then to the totem
Predator’s gone bonds cut

Black swings around in the direction of his ship

And DIVES as a plasma bolt WHIPS by

Instantly fades to invisibility triple targeting beams
searching for the shooter

Movement Black UNLOADS tearing the jungle to pieces

Return fire scorches ground Black’s form bracketed by
debris Clearly his opponent can see through the cloak

Black reacts firing fast running faster

Above him Predator -- a blur -- leaps from tree to tree
BLASTING back

Rounds COLLIDE EXPLODING mid air A fireworks show in the
dim pre-dusk light

With Black still in motion as a form CATAPULTS out of the
jungle toward him on an intercept course

IMPACT

Predator vs Super Predator Original vs Upgrade Clash of
the fucking titans

We’re tight close quarters hand to hand Think snarling
pitbulls rolling along ripping each other apart
INT PIT

Isabelle moves one arm Manages to pull a knife out of her
boot Starts to saw through the mesh

Metal frays Sounds of the fight above

Engines spool up Everything vibrates Autopilot begins the
countdown

Royce straps himself in Time to go home

EXT HUNTING CAMP

Two forms BASH each other against cages Predator and Super
Predator sized dents Cloaks fry

Gauntlets SMASH into one another Armored fist against
armored fist Blood SPATTERS

Predator gets tossed against an empty cage Steel BUCKLES
Dogs tear at the bars trying to get at him

Black’s chaingun whip-draws itself -- locks onto--
Predator as he leaps pushing the weapon upward

It fires aimlessly swiss cheesing the sky

Predator SLICES its barrels off with his wrist blades

White hot metal falls

INT PIT

SNAP a strand of alloy mesh breaks Isabelle starts sawing
through another

The walls are shaking both with the fury of the battle above
and the rising ROAR of the engines

INT SHIP

Tight on Royce Last man standing

He’s alive He made it Nothing to do now but sit back and
enjoy the ride But victory has a hollow taste

EXT HUNTING CAMP

Predator -- Black -- wrist blades locked A contest of
strength neither one willing to back down WHAM Black
delivers a vicious HEADBUTT that craters the other guy’s
helmet

INT PIT

The hole is now big enough to wiggle out Metal tears at
Isabelle’s skin as she pulls herself free

Helps Edwin out He nods grateful

INT SHIP

On Royce His eyes He can walk away He should He must

EXT HUNTING CAMP

Predator staggers Black DRIVES the wrist blades into his
back puncturing the skin at the base of the vertebrae

Wraps its hand around it Pulls with otherworldly strength
RIPS out Predator’s spinal column

It’s over

Black -- covered in blood green and black -- studies his
slain opponent Discards the grizzly object

EXT SHIP

Boosters FIRE incinerating the ground below Liftoff

EXT HUNTING CAMP
Black’s head snaps toward the ship in ample time to see it
launch into space Down force kicks up leaves knocks over

skulls One helluva exit

Black’s eyes track the ascent Twin points of pure hatred

EXT PIT

Isabelle watches as the ship passes overhead Disappears from
view In seconds all that’s left is a contrail

Edwin steps up next to her eyes on the sky
Hope -- if there was any left -- is gone

EDWIN
Beautiful isn’t it

Isabelle shifts her attention toward him

Edwin’s staring directly at her

INT HUNTING CAMP
Silence returns

Black’s gaze pans over the camp Something doesn’t feel
right Maybe it’s because--

The dogs are no longer barking

BLACK’S POV Zooming in on one of the cages A dog lies
there unmoving its form rapidly turning blue Cooling off

It’s dead
The second cage Same result

Black’s plasma caster WHIRS to life as he fades back to
invisibility At least tries to Blue sparks course around
its form as it SHIMMERS in and out Cloak is still on the
fritz

INT PIT

EDWIN
I suppose that’s the difference
between you and I When you look
out there you see nothing but
death I see home

His hand SHOOTS out rattle snake fast
A cloud of the okra-colored powder washes over her

She steps back reflexively covering her face Hands come
away Stained with the substance

ISABEL
What are you

And then she feels it

HER POV The world distorts just a bit Edwin’s face seems to
slide out of focus becoming more sinister

Her fingers suddenly feel like sausages Knife falls to the
ground

EDWIN
A neurotoxin So many to choose
from around here

EXT HUNTING CAMP

modes

A thermal shape in the bushes Gotcha Targeting system locks
on Plasma round streaks toward it Direct hit

Isabelle backs away as Edwin circles slowly keeping close
to the walls of the pit face partially obscured by the
shadows fingers digging a little divot in the earth
EDWIN

Don’t worry It’s not fatal

Youll be able to experience

everything

She stumbles back grabbing the wall for support

ISABEL
Edwin

Edwin just watches He likes to watch

EXT HUNTING CAMP
Black strides through the bushes to check on the kill
ITS POV Coming up on

A dead body of its own dog hangs off a tree Wrapped ina
hide of some creature Bottling up the heat Keeping it warm

On Black For the first time in its life in some deep dark
recess of its gene-spliced enhanced heart it knows fear
EXT PIT

Isabelle fumbles for the knife

Edwin takes it away gently like a toy from a child
retreats back into shadow examining the blade as he moves

EDWIN
You see during our time on this
planet I’ve had something of an
epiphany A revelation if you
will that I intend to share with
you

EXT HUNTING CAMP

Black spins searching

ITS POV Motion behind it Orange heat signature of a figure
moving low and fast skirting the edge of the camp Making a
circle

Targeting systems locks on About to fire--

Suddenly the heat signature disappears

That’s because--

A WALL OF FIRE spreads out in both directions In seconds
the dead brush surrounding the camp is BURNING

Heat on heat Effectively depriving Black of its thermal
vision

BLACK’S POV Nothing Shifting modes Smoke and ash obscure
motion sensors Hot wind washes away the scent The sound of
crackling wood obscures sound

Amidst all this a figure stands tall backlit by the flames
staring at the confused creature

EXT PIT

Firelight flickers over the pit Edwin hidden in the
shadows flashes in and out of vision A surreal image in a
surreal setting

ISABELLE’S POV The walls shimmer then ripple then
undulate Edwin’s features twist into a macabre sneer

Advancing slowly toward her as she backs away
EDWIN
Back on our world I’m a murderer
A freak A monster But in this
place among other monsters I
am normal

EXT HUNTING CAMP

Black fades in and out of invisibility An eerie echo of
Edwin

ITS POV Obscured panning Drowning in the ocean of thermal
red Knowing something’s out there just not what or where

A shape lunges A flaming log SWINGS
SMASH Plasma caster is toast

And then Royce is gone once again A ghost

EXT PIT
She’s pressed against the wall now Nowhere to run

EDWIN
I like it here I want to stay

Her eyes flick about desperate
EDWIN
No one is coming No one’s ever

going to come

Knife catches a flash of firelight glints

EXT HUNTING CAMP

BLACK’S POV Frantically cycles through different modes
Audio sensor kicks in Filtering out the CRACKLING of the
fire the SNAPPING twigs

Until only one sound is left

FOOTSTEPS

Black spins toward the source

Royce -- coming up for another strike -- sees it Stops cold
A pin dropping moment

Black peers in Royce’s direction

ITS POV The audio readout scrolls next to the visual feed
The line is flat

Royce stands perfectly still

BLACK’S POV Audio sensors shift Exponential magnification
Like a super-powerful zoom lens only for sound Times ten
Times a hundred And then we hear--

Faint BREATHS desperately held back A BEATING HEART
Black fires its wrist blades like a ballistic knife

Royce ducks Two projectiles whip by missing him by this
much The third catches him in the shoulder

He scrambles behind a boulder Slides against the stone
painting it red

INT PIT

Edwin cups Isabelle’s face Caresses it with a knife

EDWIN
I was right in front of you
Watching you Earning your trust
Waiting for the right time But you
couldn’t see me Guess these things
aren’t the only ones who can turn
invisible

EXT HUNTING CAMP
Royce behind a boulder blade protruding from his shoulder

Suddenly he’s YANKED off the ground

Black -- inevitable -- SQUEEZES choking the life out of
Royce

Royce grabs the bloody blade RIPS it out of his own body
RAMS into Black’s neck

The thing roars tosses Royce off to the side

He scrambles back on his feet runs

BLACK’S POV Royce’s blood trail glows on the ground leading
away

EXT PIT

Ash cascades into pit like snow Edwin doesn’t seem to notice
or mind An echo of the cave

EDWIN
Look at me Look at me

Knife tip pushes up just under her right eye drawing a
single drop of blood

EDWIN
We’re going to do this together
EXT HUNTING CAMP

Black -- flickering in and our of view -- follows the trail
of Royce’s blood passing by rows of hanging carcasses

Wood CREAKS under their weight

The blood trail leads to the base of the totem stops by a
mound of polished skulls Terminates abruptly

Black Super turns head panning searching
Unaware that--

Behind it one of the carcasses SHIFTS--
ROYCE

Emerges from within as if rejected by death itself a
fierce primitive warrior--

Black spins toward him--

Royce SWINGS a Predator axe

WHAM Black’s head snaps back He staggers backward

ITS POV Hazy distorted Different modes strobe by
shuffling by themselves like a deck of cards

A blur of perspectives One thing remains constant
Royce is coming at us axe held high
IMPACT

The thing’s helmet flies off exposing its face for the first
time

Think Predator gone terribly wrong A mutated version No
nose Oversized mandibles Slimy reptilian skin Red eyes
full of venom and hate

EDWIN
I could promise you this wouldn’t
hurt But then I would be lying

Isabelle shakes her head pleading desperate

ISABELLE
You don’t want to do this

EDWIN
I have to

ISABELLE
No You don’t understand

And then something changes in Isabelle’s eyes

Something not quite human Rippling under the skin As if
some unseen creature is stirring within

And then Edwin knows terror Off his scream

EXT HUNTING CAMP
Blacks form careens into frame

It reaches for its gauntlet Starts PUNCHING in the self
destruct code

THWACK The axe severs the arm at the elbow
The creature HOWLS

ITS POV The last thing it’1l see on the way to hell is
Royce’s axe as it descends toward it

We stay there for a beat as Royce more animal than man now
drives the axe into the monster over and over and over again

long after it’s dead

CUT TO

EXT HUNTING CAMP - MORNING
On Black Super’s smoking form

Pull back to Isabelle staring down at it

Royce stands to the side in the ash covered camp looking out

over burnt trees and dead jungle toward the horizon
ROYCE
First time in my life I don’t have
any idea what to do

On Isabelle A long beat

ISABELLE
I might have a few

SMASH TO BLACK

XALTERNATE ENDING

EXT PIT — NIGHT

EDWIN
I could promise you this wouldn’t
hurt But then I would be lying

She strains to whisper something Inaudible

EDWIN
I’m sorry I didn’t quite catch
that

Ear at her mouth Three tiny word

ISABELLE
So would I

Something flashes in her hand drawn from Edwin’s breast
pocket

HIS SCALPEL
SLASH
He dodges Grins

EDWIN
You missed

ISABELLE
I didn’t

A thin line of blood wells up on his neck Nothing more than
a paper cut

In his own words

ISABELLE
Very poisonous Very deadly All it
would take is one scratch

On Edwin comprehension dawning And then

The poison from the plant -- still coating the edge of the
scalpel -- hits him like a ton of bricks His core
temperature rising Neurons firing Brain boiling inside his
own skull Blood seeps from his eyes lips nose

He SCREAMS Convulses Doesn’t go gentle into that good
night

All the torment inflicted upon his untold victims is visited
upon Edwin ten fold

EXT HUNTING CAMP

Blacks form careens into frame next to the totem

It reaches for its gauntlet Starts PUNCHING in the self
destruct code

THWACK The axe severs the arm at the elbow
The creature HOWLS

ITS POV The last thing it’1l see on the way to hell is
Royce’s axe as it descends toward it

Driving it backward Into the spikes of the totem
BLACK

FADE IN

EXT HUNTING CAMP —- MORNING

A newly born sun peeks over the horizon The long night --
and the terror it brought - are finally over

The camp Or rather what’s left of it Smoldering Decimated
Post appocalytic

The body of the Black Super Predator hangs off the totem a
spike driven through the side of its head Poleaxed

Royce and Isabelle sit at the base of the monument Bleeding
Battered 12 rounds Still standing

Nothing is said Nothing needs to be said
Silence
Cut short by--

Ground begins to vibrate barely perceptible at first
Growing stronger rising in intensity and volume

As if a freight train was coming toward them
Slowly Royce stands up Isabelle alongside him
Ready for whatever comes next

Dust and ash swirl all around obscuring vision in all
directions

Then the cloud settles revealing--

A PREDATOR SHIP

This isn’t the Enterprise Ugly Battered Functional
They stare

A form SHIMMERS into view A Predator Another More About a
dozen of them

Royce and Isabelle No energy to fight No point to run They
simply wait

Predators part like the Red Sea Their leader -- his armor
different from the rest covered in trophies from untold
hunts -- approaches

Surveys up our duo The devastation Last but not least the
slain Black Super Predator

Slowly he removes his helmet
The face beneath it belongs to--
DUTCH

The man The myth The legend

DUTCH
Not bad kid Not bad at all

SMASH TO BLACK

THE END
