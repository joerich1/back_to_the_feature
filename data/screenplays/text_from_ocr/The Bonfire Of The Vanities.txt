He passes somebody elses cake
around and picks up the crumbs
But you have to imagine a lot of

golden crumb he can get his hands

a hell of a jolt and the right
wing tip digs into the sand and
the plane skids around in a circle
360 degrees before we stop Were
scared shitless Panic And we
look into the cabin and theres
everybody calm quiet theyre
picking up their luggage and their
animals and theyre looking out
the window at the little fire that
started on the wing and theyre
waiting for the doors to open like
nothing happened And then it
dawns on me They think this is
normal

Ill need some furniture too
And a new refrigerator
And although I should probably
continue to live in that shithole
