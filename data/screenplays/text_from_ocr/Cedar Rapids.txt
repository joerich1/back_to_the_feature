miss the marks on his neck left behind by the belt Tim is

the front of a long line of uneasy MOURNERS Tim holds back
tears as he gently touches the marks on Lemkes neck

Tim steps aside to greet the widow Gwen Lemke in a receiving
line The grief has left her gaunt She appears medicated

TIM (CONTD)

attention of Trent the desk clerk

TRENT

the opening bars of Clarence Carters PATCHES kick in
NOTE

Patches is an EXTREMELY sentimental soul song about a poor

black kid named Patches The first verse is spoken word

TIM (CONTD)
(reading off the screen)
I was born and raised down in
Alabama On a farm way back up in
the woods I was so ragged that
folks used to call me Patches Papa
used to tease me about it But deep
down inside he was hurt cause
hed done all he could

Joan and Dean whoo-hoo

TIM (CONTD)
(breaks into song very soulful)
My papa was a great old man I can
see him with a shovel in his hands
See education he never had He did
wonders when the times got bad The
little money from the crops he raised
barely paid the bills we made

Joan and Dean rush to the dance floor Ronald remains on his
bar stool but bops his head politely Tim tears it up

Patches continues creating a

knew that when you get all dolled
up go to the prom-- the Big Dance--
that you gotta be prepared to put
out To show a little teat
(off Tims confused look)
You ever hear of PayPal Tim

TIM

teat I rewarded him with the Two
Diamonds three years running Im
prepared to do the same for you
