IRAQ - 2002

Desert night Full moon No wind Concrete bunker-- a
lonesome speck in the cold white galaxy of sand

TWO IRAQI SENTRIES stand outside the bunker 1 at the front
entrance 2 atop the bunker’s watch platform

Glint of light in the distance Moonlight reflection
Sentry 2 raises his binoculars

BINOCULAR POV pinprick flash on a faraway dune
The snipers bullet DRILLS HIM BETWEEN THE EYES
CUTS THE BINOCULARS IN TWO

Sentry 2 crumples soundlessly

A lens in each hand

Phantom streaks

Glimpses of a small ASSAULT SQUAD

Flying across waves of sand

Toward a bunker devoid of live sentries

INT IRAQI PRISON BUNKER - NIGHT

Tiny cells line the walls

Occupants shadow obscured Behind rusted bars
Ragged clothes Starvation thin

The drain in the center of each cell is the toilet
Iragi Guards patrol AK-47s slung

All is calm

FLASH-CRACK

Door explosions

Stun grenades

Guards VAPORIZE

Silent machinegun fire
Turning them to mist

The ASSAULT SQUAD charges in
Faces unseen

Just scars

Robotic eyes

The fight is over

All Iraqi Guards slaughtered wholesale
Elapsed battle time 315 seconds

Silence resumes
The prisoners inch forward

Some on their knees

Too skeletal to stand

They grip their bars

They are AMERICANS

They see the assault squad

ALSO AMERICANS

Focus on three particular squad members in the forefront

two massive Comanche Indians-- The Brothers BILLY and JOHNNY

CABLE And the squad leader COLONEL FRANCIS REMO 1

A prisoner with the strength to speak slumps his head
against bars says

PRISONER

vigilantism
CHAMBERS

CHAMBERS
Don’t let your “perfect performance

video arcade called Space Paranoids

Olive has spotters everywhere They watch as gang members
enter the building

apartment on the fifth floor of an abandoned building

They’ve been there a while now Adrenaline has worn off
Boredom has taken root

Into the arcade GANGSTA THUGZ mill suspiciously around the
corridors of arcade games

There is a filthy queen-size MATTRESS in the corner
Huge YELLOW-BROWN stain in the center

CHAMBERS

Are you kidding me

CHAMBERS
How about for fifty thousand
dollars would you sleep on it

How much would it take

Frost ‘eyes the mattress It is a brave new world of
disgusting

FROST
At least a hundred million dollars

CHAMBERS
That’s insane

FROST

For a hundred million dollars I’d
fuck that mattress

Frost shakes his head This is an absurd conversation He
iooks out the window watching traffic in front of the

Move toward it Guns up

Get to the drivers window

A WHITE WOMAN in her 40s Kids in back Clearly lost

INT APARTMENT - DAY

OLIVE (V0)
False alarm Driver was just--

A laser line of smoke SHOOTS straight from the rooftop above
Chambers and Frost

WHOOSHING across the entire street
Toward the arcade
PUNCTURE-BLASTING through its windows

INT SPACE PARANOIDS - THAT MOMENT
Smoke everywhere Gang members running Shouting
Pire alarm going apeshit haywire

INT APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

Chambers and Frost stare at the smoke trail realize it leads
back te the roof of the building they’re in

FROST
What the hell

Chambers is already gone running for the stairwell Frost
is right behind him

INT STAIRWELL - DAY

Chambers and Frost Flying up stairs
Two three at a time

Shopping cart in the way

Vault it Never slowing

They reach the door to the roof
Chambers plows through the door
Frost yanks him back into the stairwell--

AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE ERUPTS from behind an industrial air
conditioning unit PERFORATES the door

INT SPACE PARANOIDS - THAT MOMENT

The smoke thins a bit inside the arcade
Gang members still on the floor
They see it embedded in the wall Their faces drop

Now everyone sees the missile

No one moves No one breathes

A smoke alarm chirps

Then as if given a signal everyone stampedes out of the
building

EXT ROOFTOP - DAY

Chambers and Frost crouch behind the doorway

The gunfire stops They lean out

UNLOADING pistols into the air conditioning unit
They stop Silence

Chambers reloads Runs out

Toward the air conditioning unit

FIRING as he goes

FROST
Chambers

Frost stays low Popping off a full clip of cover fire

EXT SPACE PARANOIDS - THAT MOMENT

People spilling out of the arcade

Gang members hunting for enemies

Coming face to face with bewildered gang cops

EXT ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

Chambers reaches the site of the missile launch at the edge
of the roof Frost behind him Gun ready

A spent launch tube lies there
Whoever fired it is nowhere to be seen
INT SPACE PARANOIDS - THAT MOMENT

The missile in the wall teeters It comes loose
It falls to the floor and DETONATES on impact

OVERHEAD VIEW OF SPACE PARANOIDS

It IMPLODES

Like the house at the end of Poltergeist

Crumpling like a stomped beer can

Sucking the Gang Leaders and their henchmen into it

Sucking every car in front of the building into it

Building facades PEEL into the vortex
Pipework and electrical wires
Twisting and slithering

RIPPING into the air

Spewing water Zapping electricity

Furniture flies

Kitchen appliances and TVs

SMASHING through walls

A refrigerator collides with a Lexus
In mid air

EXPLODES

EXT ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT

The implosion force vacuums Chambers and Frost across the
roof Like a skipping stone

Chambers snags a cable of some sort
Frost keeps going

Over the edge

BASHING into a fire escape railing
Holds on Screaming

EXT DOWNTOWN LA - THAT MOMENT

A skinny mushroom cloud rises in the distance

EXT ROOFTOP - THAT MOMENT
The suction dissipates

Chambers staggers to the edge of the roof Looks down
Sees Frost half a floor down standing safely on a fire
escape landing

Sees where Space Paranoids once stood

It looks like the surface of the moon

Street lights bow toward the epicenter of the implosion

CHAMBERS
Holy Fucking Shit
Frost begins to climb up the ladder

Halfway up-- METAL POPS BRICK DUST SPRAYS
The fire escape starts to PEEL OFF THE BUILDING
FROM top to bottom

Frost TEETERS BACK WITH THE TOP PART SLOWLY
Five stories up Arcing over the street

FROST
Whoa Whoa WHOA

CHAMBERS
Hold on

Chambers looks around Frantic
For something to reach Frost with

The fire escape bends back further
RIPPING WHOLE CHUNKS of building with it

FROST
CHAMBERS

Frost hangs on
Fingers clawed onto the ladder rung
Metal buckles The world shakes

There is nothing Chambers can do
Nothing Frost can do

The fire escape falls

Cantilevers out Hinged at the third floor
SLAMS TO A STOP HORIZONTALLY

Three stories over the street

BUCKING Frost loose

He plummets

Eyes closed
Wind RUSHING

He lands

Bounces

Lands again

On something soft

Opens his eyes

Face inches from a big brown and yellow stain

He is on THE MATTRESS

It has been sucked into the street
Along with most of the building’s innards

Chambers stands five stories above
Face plastered with awe Then he screams

CHAMBERS
Frost

Frost looks up

Frost rolls

Out of the way nanoseconds before--

The ENTIRE FIRE ESCAPE CRUSH-LANDS ON THE MATTRESS

cut TO BLACK

INT LAPDMUSTER ROOM - DAY

Captain Wrigley and Lieutenant Olive stand before a room full
of cops A tall man in a grey suit stands behind them
Chambers and Frost sit in the back row

WRIGLEY
To fill in the details and answer
your questions about what were up
against this is Special Agent
Dwight Hendrix head of the federal
arm of the task force

Wrigley steps aside Motions to the man in the grey suit
SPECIAL AGENT HENDRIX takes the stage 47 years old Face
of chipped concrete

AGENT HENDRIX
Heres what we know Somehow
somebody got a hold of an M42-A
Thermoberic Missile Launcher It
fires a miniaturized version of the
Fuel Air bombs used for Afghan cave
busting Each missile contains two
explosive devices The first
spreads an aerosol fuel
concentrate The second ignites
this aerosol to around 3000 degrees
centigrade The flash combustion
burns all the oxygen within the
blast cloud instantaneously
creating a vacuum powerful enough
to uproot a redwood

Chambers smiles at a pretty detective named MIMI DUPREE She
smiles back Frost elbows Chambers Up front Olive takes
over

OLIVE
Our investigation will be dual
pronged First It’s likely the
shooter is a rival gang member
We’re gonna canvass the known gang
universe to find him Door-to-door
searches if necessary Second
the missile It is built and used
exclusively by the US military
They have no idea how it could have
fallen into the wrong hands

(MORE)

OLIVE (contd)
Regardless we are going to talk to
every Army base and arms
manufacturer in the state

Wrigley takes the mic again

WRIGLEY
There is a shitstorm on the street
right now The Rollin’ 20s are
blaming the 83rd St Gangsters for
what happened and vice versa We
need to end it You all have your
assignments Dismissed

The cops rise and begin to file out A woman enters the
muster room walking against the exiting flow Tall and
skinny Lemon blonde pony tail CAROLINE HALLMARK age 29
walks right up to Wrigley Olive and Agent Hendrix

HALLMARK
Excuse me

They all turn

HALLMARK
I think I might know where that
missile came from

Frost snatches the Pop Tart money from Chambers Slips it in
the machine Hits buttons Two Snickers fall

INT LAPDMUSTER ROOM - DAY

The master room is empty Except for Wrigley Olive Agent
Hendrix and Caroline Hallmark Theyve been talking

AGENT HENDRIX
It’s an interesting theory but
there’s no way Francis Remo is
behind this

HALLMARK
His unit was one of the few that
had access to those weapons
Factor that in with the vendetta he
has against this country and--

AGENT HENDRIX
-Youve been out of the loop Miss
Hallmark Francis Remo is dead
Over a year Car bomb in Karachi
I’ve seen the pictures

HALLMARK
And I have a program on my computer
called Photoshop

Chambers and Frost enter leading Dallas She and Chambers
munch Snickers bars

Hallmark sees them approaching

HALLMARK
Shes not causing trouble is she

FROST
No no not at all

DALLAS
They think I’m lost
Hallmark takes the girl’s hand

WRIGLEY
Chambers Frostmeet Sergeant
Caroline Hallmark Shes a former
Delta Force operator

They shake

WRIGLEY
She thinks that a covert special
operations unit with access to
those missiles might be selling
the weapons to the highest bidder

HALLMARK
Doesn’t look like I’m gonna be much
good though
(eyes Hendrix)
Been out of the loop too long

WRIGLEY
No no We value your candor and
expertise If you don’t mind
filling out a statementanything
is helpful at this point

HALLMARK
I don‘t mind at all Where do I go
for that

WRIGLEY
I’1l walk you over

Olive nods

INT LAPDTASK FORCE HQ - DAY

Task force cops gear up for action Loading guns Checking
hand radio frequencies Strapping on Kevlar

Chambers and Frost can see all this through the door window
of their shoebox office where they sit at adjoining desks
sifting through mountains of paperwork

CHAMBERS

You know I don’t even know what
I‘m doing here I mean literally
I don’t know what I’m doing Al
this paperwork-- I wasn’t meant for
this

(then)
This might be worse than dealing
with juvie scum

FROST
No way We‘’re on a major task
force here This is where we
always wanted to be

CHAMBERS
Where I want to be is out there
hunting down the shooter finding
out where that missile came from

INT HOTEL SUITE - DAY

of the living room Newspaper covers the floor beneath him
like a drop cloth Theres an open tool box nearby There’s
a car battery and jumper cables The man was KARL

From the opening battle scene As one of the fearsome
ASSAULT SQUAD operators

Billy Cable is six feet six inches of full-blooded Comanche
Indian Hes wearing a raincoat He‘’s wearing rubber gloves
and holding an electric chainsaw The blade HUMMMS Dipping
toward the body

A Merc shuts the bathroom door in our face
A Merc named FRITZ talks on a land line phone

FRITZ
It’s as bad as we thought Remo
Karl stole the missile while on
guard duty Sold it right out of
this room to some drug dealer in
South Central

REMO (0S8)
And no one else on our end was
involved

FRITZ
Definitely not He would have told
me

REMO (0S)

If the cops find that drug dealer
they could trace the missile back
to us

FRITZ
What do you want done

REMO (0S)
Were moving the operation ahead of
schedule

FRITZ
How soon

REMO (0S)
Well talk about it when I get to
town

Fritz looks nervous

FRITZ
You’re coming to LA now

a botched carjacking

FROST
But what if The shooter fires
the missile gets shot by us runs
away tries to drive home bleeds
out crashes into a pole winds up
in the intensive care unit of St

Olive considers this
OLIVE
Utterly improbable

But I guess someone could swing
by the hospital to check it out
They look at him expectantly--

OLIVE
Don’t fuck it up

EXT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A red Corvette pulls to the curb in front of the hospital
Driver Billy Cable Passenger his little brother-- JOHNNY

A call for the Doctor comes over the loudspeaker

DOCTOR
Excuse me

Johnny Cable walks past Turns a corner

FROST
Tyrone Deakins is a drug dealer

the drug traffic in the city
Tyrone’s an industrious independent
drug dealer this merger happens
hes screwed Somehow he gets his
hands on one of those missiles
Knows about the meeting And he
figures great I can blow my
competition away in a single shot

CHAMBERS
Except Tyrone’s got shitty luck and
didn’t count on us having the place
staked out

FROST
Correct And right after Tyrone
fires the missile were unloading
on him--

CHAMBERS
--And then I hit him

FROST
You Maybe we both hit him He
was shot twice

CHAMBERS
I know I’ve been thinking I
probably hit him both times

(soft)
Goddamn Double Tap

Chambers thinks for a split second something formulating
behind his eyes Frost notices

FROST
You want me to call you that dont

CHAMBERS
You gotta admit Double Tap is a
sweet-as-hell nickname

Silence Frost does Chambers a favor Pretends the last two
seconds never happened

Waits for a Doctor to pass Then pushes through into--

TYRONE’S HOSPITAL ROOM

and closes the door silently behind him

Tyrone is asleep in bed Hooked to all the usual machines
Johnny approaches the bed Soundlessly

Johnny draws a syringe filled with four milliliters of castor
oil plant extract It will cause cardiovascular collapse
within minutes Within hours the toxin will dissipate
totally No trace

Johnny lifts Tyrone’s blankets Lifts his leg Stabs the
needle into the saphenous vein behind the knee Thumbs the
plunger About to inject

The door opens

at Tyrones bed The blankets are strangely pushed aside
exposing one leg But Johnny is gone They never saw him
The nurse approaches Tyrone‘s bed

Johnny is hiding behind the HALF-DRAWN ROOM PARTITION which
is essentially a drape that hangs from ceiling to floor He
watches the nurse through the thin space near the wall

His eyes pan to Chambers and Frost See the shoulder rig
under Chambers windbreaker Then back to the nurse
Shes squinting at the small fresh puncture wound on
Tyrone’s exposed leg Her face fills with concern She
turns to Chambers and Frost

Chambers extends a hand Shakes

HALLMARK
Detective Frost

Sorry for making you guys come all
the way out here But I had to be
here for work s0

CHAMBERS
What are you a soccer coach

HALLMARK
No no You know Dallas
there

Chambers and Frost look at the little girl guarding the right
goal

HALLMARK

Her father is some big shot banker
And some of his former South
American clients are dead set on
kidnapping her So he hired me for
protection I’m with her every
weekday from when she goes to
school in the morning to when I
drop her off after soccer

(then
Last couple weeks my life has been
an endless loop of second grade I
even started to dream in second
grade

FROST
Sounds horrible

HALLMARK
Actually I kinda like it
ge en )
I understand you have some
questions about one Johnny Cable

CHAMBERS
Uh-huh

HALLMARK
Wellif it’s Johnny Cable youre
interested in Id recommend taking
an interest in his brother too
Where there’s one there is always
the other

FROST
What brother

A whistle BLOWS Game’s over The kids run to the sideline

HALLMARK
Hold on a sec

Hallmark moves into the throng of kids Grabs the young
goalie by the hand Walks her back to Frost and Chambers

HALLMARK

and Mr Frost

Dallas waves

DALLAS
Hi

CHAMBERSFROST
Hi Dallas

HALLMARK
You guys are welcome to ride along
while I drop off Dallas On the
way I can tell you a thing or two
about little Johnny Cable and his
big bad brother Billy

INT MINI VAN (MOVING) LATER

Hallmark drives Chambers shotgun Frost in back next to
Dallas

HALLMARK
The whole time I knew Johnny he
thought he was hot stuff ‘cause
Billy was such a legend in special
ops Johnny thought he was just as
good But that geek was always
more talk than walk

CHAMBERS
So Billy was in Delta Force with
you

HALLMARK

He was and he wasnt Maybe five
years before I got there he was
finishing the Delta Culmination
Exercise when he was recruited
into a CIA Special Unit run by a
man named Francis Remo We worked
a lot with Billy’s unit but he
never officially became Delta
FROST
Who is this Francis Remo You
mentioned him in your statement

HALLMARK

A Frankenstein monster created by
Special ops specializing in
counterinsurgency When oversight
committees started sniffing around
in ‘04 the Pentagon scapegoated
him forced him out

(then)
One of Remo’s talents was taking
borderline psychopathic soldiers
and turning them into expert
killers-- like Billy Cable

CHAMBERS
Whats his story

HALLMARK
He was a Force Recon Marine In
the Gulf War he was the only
sniper from any country to
maintain a perfect operational
record

CHAMBERS
Just like you Frost

HALLMARK
Which is to say every time Billy
squeezed the trigger someone died
And he squeezed that trigger a
shitload 98 confirmed kills
Guys a Goddamn cyborg

FROST
Uh is it okay to swear around her

HALLMARK
Dallas Oh yeah Her dad curses
like a beaten whore The damage is
already done Right Dal

DALLAS
The damage is already done with me

HALLMARK
Anyway What was I saying

CHAMBERS
Something about Billy being a
cyborg
HALLMARK

Oh yeah

(then)
The thing that really made Billy a
psycho-- it’s just a rumor but I
believe it --is that he is said to
have suffered from Texas Tower
Syndrome

CHAMBERS
What in the world is Texas Tower
Syndrome

HALLMARK

Its named after the Charles
Whitman University of Texas bell
tower massacre Its when a sniper
starts shooting and can’t stop
The killing just feels too good
The line between legitimate and
illegitimate targets disappears

FLASH TO

BLASTING from his sniper‘s nest
Killing both US and Iragi soldiers 1000 meters away

A MARINE RADIO MAN runs up GRABS him

Billy whirls
BLOWS THE MARINE’S HEAD OFF

BACK TO SCENE

FROST
That can’t be true Someone did
that they’d be court-martialed

CHAMBERS
Or given the firing squad

HALLMARK
Not if they’re a Billy Cable and
it’s an isolated incident

FROST
Is that all you can tell us
aboutrumors and statistics I
mean you dont know if they have
contacts in the area places they
might have frequented where the
missiles or Billy might be
something

HALLMARK
Oh I know exactly where Billy is

FROST
Then why didn’t you say so before

HALLMARK
Because before I couldnt see that
it was Billy in the car behind us

left the soccer field

Frost and Chambers turn They see the red Corvette

murder you Frost

FROST

HALLMARK
Why not pest stake out your house
Why go through this I mean any
second now he’s gonna open fire on
usbroad daylight in the middle
of the street

CHAMBERS
What‘re we gonna do
HALLMARK
I say we push Frost out of the car
Dallas looks at Frost nodding her approval of this plan

FROST
Seriously what do we do

HALLMARK
Only thing we can
Comanch to the spi

HALLMARK
Well I‘m gonna jump out of this

She loads the sub-machinegun with one hand on the wheel

Now do either of you have any
tactical driving experience “Like

course at cop school

Pressed flat against the balcony floor curving over the
edge

Chambers tries to control his breathing

Hanging off the balcony

Staring into an abyssal trench of LA street light
A million miles straight down

The Merc walks to the balcony’s edge
Chambers hears him coming

Slowly INSANELY Chambers lets go with one hand Draws his
Glock Aims up

The Merc moves closer

Chambers’ aim tightens

He can see the very top of the Merc’s head
Maybe he can blow it off

His aim tightens more

A trigger pull starts

The Merc’s head dips away

The trigger pull stops

Chambers hears footsteps

Chambers hears a door shut

Thats all
The Merc has gone back inside

Chambers breathes relief then in an instant remembering
where he is mutters

REMO

That was so long ago

Forget it Ail those questions are
unimportant What is important is
how much Fritz told you before I
shot him in the face And who if
anyone youve told

(to Frost)
Did she do the thumb in the eyeball
thing I taught her that She
never quite got it though See
here’s the real trick You gotta
jouge one eye out first
immediately before asking any
questions then threaten the
interrogatee with total blindness
Like this

past They run after it Firing into the back

The truck veers around a turn Chambers and Frost follow

EXT DOCK 9 - THAT MOMENT

The Pacific Courier truck slams to a stop Three Mercs start
off-loading the missiles on to the boat

CHAMBERS AND FROST

run toward dock 9

EXT VIKING YACHT DECK - DAY
The mercs load the last missile crate on to the deck
Remo keys a hand radio

REMO
Get us to the airport

The yacht pulls away

MERC
What if they call someone

Remo kicks open a crate Hoists up a Thermobaric Missile
Launcher Aims it at the dock

CHAMBERS AND FROST

run out on the dock

They see the Viking yacht already heading out to sea

They see Remo on the deck aiming a missile launcher dead at
them

Chambers and Frost raise their guns and fire

EXT VIKING YACHT DECK - THAT MOMENT

Bullets spark everywhere

A Merc is blasted overboard
Remos kneecap blows off

He falls flat on his back
LAUNCHING the missile

It flies Straight up

Hundreds of meters over the boat
Remo struggles to key his radio

REMO
Full throttle

The yacht leaps forward Engine ROARING

The missile stops its upward momentum and begins to fall

Remo follows the smoke trail with his eyes

The missile SPLASHES into the water
Maybe fifty meters behind the yacht

And IMPLODES on impact
VooooM
The yacht keels Accelerating toward the vortex i

Remo drags his body acr the deck
Peeks over the side His eyes pop saucer wide

Mercs jump overboard and are instantly sucked away
Remo just slumps over the side watching

The yacht hits the implosion
The yacht crumples

This DETONATES EVERY MISSILE ON BOARD
A universe of fire collapsing on itself
Implosions within implosions

San Pedro bay splits like the Red Sea
Wedged open in a spectral whirl

The ocean floor is visible

The ocean floor is burning

Chambers and Frost are slurped backward
Scrape-skipping across pavement

Then airborne

They slam into a railing

Snag hold Bodies horizontal

Junk from open containers WHIZZING by with shrapnel force
Toys Clothes Glitter confetti Bicycles Rowboats
Chung Li shoots by Screaming Clawing at the ground
He flies out to sea amid the storm of debris
Waves RECOIL Over the swirling sphere of light
HISSING like a galaxy of snakes
EXT DOCK 9 - THAT MOMENT
Chambers and Frost land hard Like the anti-gravity machine
just shut off They stand Barely They Turn A lone cop
car pulls up A lone cop get out Face hanging
Chambers and Frost move toe the cop car

CHAMBERS

(to cop)
Were cops And we need your car

cop 1
Let me see your badge

Frost punches him flat Chambers grabs his car keys

FROST

CHAMBERS
Billy Cable He didn’t see us
Youre supposed to be at that safe
house right now
(then)
Where you think he’s going with
that missile

INT SAFE HOUSE - DAY

Olive nods Pours candy into Frosts dad’s hand

FROST‘S DAD

Chambers’ mom appears to be in the midst of a nervous
breakdown she looks up Starts bawling

CHAMBERS’ DAD
I knew something like this was
bound to happen I begged Reilly
not to become a police officer
Begged him

Chambers’ mom cries more Olive tries to calm her Pats her
ack

OLIVE

LAPD safe house Steel-plated

Olive’s cell rings

OLIVE
Excuse me a moment

He answers He listens He flips his cell shut
OLIVE

This safe house is no longer safe
EXT STREET - DAY
Billys Corvette veers around the corner Cruises down a
street of bungalows with little green lawns Kids ride their
bikes in gangs Kids draw on driveways with colored chalk
Billy slows Stops He sees the safe house a block away
Unmarked cop cars in front
EXT FREEWAY DAY
A squad car tears through traffic Sirens blaring
Frost at the wheel Chambers beside him
They hit an off ramp doing 90
EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY
Billy lifts the missile crate out of the Corvette’s passenger
seat Lays it on the sidewalk Drops to a knee and starts
to pry it open by hand A little girl roller blades past
A click Billy turns

He’s staring down the barrel of Olives 44 Bulldog Olives
gun hand is trembling almost imperceptibly

OLIVE
Don’t Move

Six cops charge out of the bushes Guns aimed at Billy

Olive frisks Billy with one hand Grabs his Glock Tosses
it Olive drops a set of cuffs before Billy

OLIVE
Cuff yourself
Billy picks up the cuffs Billy spins

Olive never gets a shot off

Billy Cable has his arm

Billy Cable has his gun

Rips it free

Elbow-smashes Olive unconscious

Holds him like a shield

Billy fires the 44 Bulldog

So fast it sounds like a machinegun

The six surrounding cops fall dead

Billy drops Olive

Neighborhood kids run screaming

Billy aims down at the comatose Olive

CLICK

The six shooter is empty

A squad car comes fishtailing around the corner
Billy’s eyes ZOOM FOCUS on Frost behind the wheel

The car RAMS Billy head on
BOUNCES him off the windshield and onte a driveway

Chambers and Frost jump out of the car

Billy already limping for a dead cop’s gun

Chambers and Frost unload

Billys back blows suit fabric

Billy dives inte an open two-car garage with no cars in
The garage door starts to close

Chambers and Frost look at each other

FROST
He’s got a vest

CHAMBERS
Go for the head shot

They reload and sprint toward the closing door
Firing into it as they go

The door is a foot off the ground
They hit the driveway in unison Rolling into the--

GARAGE
milliseconds before the door SLAMS DOWN

ill

it

Billy is nowhere to be seen

Chambers looks up

Billy is hanging from the ceiling one hand on the garage
door rail

The other gripping an eight-inch Bowie knife

Billy drops
Chambers and Frost roll
No time to aim guns

Billy SLASHES
SLICES Frost across the back

Frost falls
Tries to come around with his pistol
Billy kicks it out of his hand

Chambers raises his MP7

Billy moves in flashes
SMACKS the MP7 clear across the garage
STABS the Bowie knife at Chambers’ head

Billy bucks forward Drops to a knee

The knife stabs into the concrete floor
Actually sticks there

Frost is on Billy’s back

Like a kid getting a piggyback ride

Billy rises off his knee to his feet quite swiftly
Like there wasn’t a full grown man on his back trying to
strangle him

FROST
Chambers

Chambers goes for his MP7
It’s on the other side of the garage

Billy elbows Frost in the ribs

Lunges backward

SMASHES a wall rack of gardening equipment
Frost hangs on

Billy reaches back
Grabs Frost by the hair and neck

Tears him up and off
POWER HEAVES him into a riding mower

Chambers has his MP7 again

Billy KICKS him in the face
Chambers and the MP7 sail

Frost HAMMERS an old 27-inch Sony Trinitron

Screen down on Billy’s head

THWONK

The screen does not break

The impact knocks Billy to his hands and knees

He regains his senses He looks up Rivers of blood
streaming out from his hair and over his face

Billy blinks Billy freezes

Billy stares pale-eyed at Chambers and Frost

Theyre both on a knee aiming dead at him
Frost a pistol Chambers a sub-machinegun
Time stops

FROST
Youre vaccinated fucker

Billy LURCHES FORWARD
They DRAIN THEIR GUNS INTO HIS FACE
Billy hits the floor in pieces

Chambers and Frost rise to their feet
Look at each other There is nothing to say

Frost hits the button The garage door grinds open

It looks like the entire LAPD is outside SWAT teams Cars
on the lawn Even Olive Head bleeding Gawking at
Chambers and Frost in total amazement

Chambers and Frost walk out of the smoking cave Staggering
like zombies Tracking red footprints on a hop scotch game

Their parents are there too In the back of a police truck
that is blocked by cop congestion

Frost and his dad exchange waves

Chambers’ dad just nods once as if to say well done
Chambers nods back

Chambers pulls his mini bottle of tequila from his pocket
Opens it Holds it up as if initiating a toast Tilts his
head back and pours the entire bottle into his mouth
Gagging Like he might puke Finally chokes it down

FADE TO BLACK

INT LAPDSQUAD ROOM - DAY

Chambers and Frost sit at their desks The cuts and
scratches on their faces are healing nicely Chambers is

A FED EX GUY walks into the squad room

business He stops at the desks of Chambers and Frost

Chambers looks up from his scrap book

CHAMBERS
