FADE IN

Inside a closet

It is a large closet with double doors a crisp line of

cutting down through the center of

the darkness

As we begin to descend voices echo in our head

VIOLET (VO)
I had this image of you

We move past a shelf filled with hatboxes and handbags

is a womans closet

CORKY (VO)

You planned this whole thing didnt

CAESAR (VO)

Wheres the fucking money

We glide over the tightly packed hangers close enough

feel the different fabrics and descend past the dresses

the racks of high heels

VIOLET (VO)
We make our own choices
own prices

CAESAR (VO)
All part of the business

VIOLET (VO)

What choice
We slide along the delicate taper of a stiletto heel
reach the bottom of the closet where we find a pair of
Dr Martens boots that are tied together with a white

VIOLET (VO)

I want out
We move up the boots and we see it is a woman who is
lying motionless on the floor of the closet the rope
tightly around her wrists
The crack at the bottom of the door lights her face
gagged and unconscious a trickle of blood running down
forehead Her name is CORKY

VIOLET (VO)
Like a part of me

INT ELEVATOR - DAY
Leaning against the back of the elevator is Corky a

butch-looking woman with short hair and a black leather
jacket She is a lesbian and wants people to know it

As the doors begin to slide shut a woman yells

WOMAN
Wait Hold the elevator

Corky pushes the open button A couple steps into
elevator His name is CAESAR a middle-aged Italian
an expensive suit and sunglasses

She is VIOLET a piece of sexual candy that would melt

your mouth
against

finally

INTO

the tub

cream

She hears it again a guttural sound
CORKY

Thanks again for this opportunity

Mr Bianchinni Goodbye
She hangs up the phone and walks toward the wall
As she gets closer we hear a bed rocking tapping
the wall
The mans breathing grows more and more labored until

it swells --

DISSOLVING

INT BATHROOM - MORNING

The whining motor of a high-powered drain-rod

The spiral cable whips wildly spiraling deeper into
drain black goo splattering everywhere

The machine is so loud Corky almost cannot hear someone
pounding on the apartment door

Killing the motor she stands and goes to the door
Behind the door is Violet wearing jeans a white T-
and cowboy boots
VIOLET
Hi My name is Violet We sort of

met in the elevator --

CORKY
Yeah sure Im Corky

VIOLET
I heard you working in here and I
just wondered if youd like a cup of
coffee

She is holding two cups of coffee one black one with

CORKY
Sure Come on in Give me a minute

Violet steps inside as Corky goes back to the bathroom
to
wash off the drain dreck

VIOLET
What happened to Rajeev

Corky calls from the bathroom scrubbing her hands
vigorously

CORKY
Who

VIOLET
Rajeev the man who usually works on
the building

CORKY
Oh he went home to India but as
far as I know hell be back

She wipes her hands on her overalls returning to the
main
room

VIOLET
So this is temporary for you

CORKY
Pretty much One day at a time

Violet hands her the cup of black coffee

VIOLET
I guessed you were straight black

CORKY
Good guess

They both sip from the piping hot mugs

CORKY

Mmmm thanks I needed this
VIOLET

My pleasure but to be honest I

did have a slightly ulterior motive
here I was wondering if I could
ask a small favor
CORKY
A favor

VIOLET
Yeah see Im kind of a night person
so I was wondering if it wasnt a
terrible inconvenience if you could
wait a bit before using power tools

CORKY
Oh Im sorry --

VIOLET
No it isnt your fault The walls
here are just so thin

CORKY
Are they really

VIOLET
Yes it really causes problems
Sometimes its like youre in the
same room But if its too much
trouble I understand

CORKY
No no trouble Theres other work
to do

VIOLET

Youre doing everything yourself

CORKY
Yeah
VIOLET
That is so amazing Im in awe of

people who can fix things My dad
was like that We never had anything
new Whenever something broke he
would open it up tinker with it and
it would work His hands were magic

She looks at Corkys hands cupped around the mug
VIOLET
Yeah I bet your car is twenty
years old

Corky smiles

CORKY
Truck

VIOLET
Truck Of course

CORKY
63 Chevy
VIOLET

VIOLET SIPS
VIOLET
So how do you know the owner Mr
Bianchinni
CORKY

him
VIOLET
Oh really

Corky suddenly feels she has revealed something

CORKY
Do you know him

VIOLET
No but Caesar does He likes him
Says hes a good Italian

CORKY
Caesar is your husband

VIOLET
Oh no no Im not the marrying
kind

Smiling she says nothing else

VIOLET

cup off anytime

CORKY

VIOLET

CORKY watches her leave

EXT THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

A dirty bar hidden away on a dark street its cracked
white sign the only evidence it exists

Corkys truck swings into a space in front of a couple
large motorcycles She flips her collar and heads for
door

INT THE WATERING HOLE - NIGHT

The smell of leather and cigarette smoke fills Corkys
as she crosses to the bar

BARTENDER
Well well

Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over

BARTENDER
Been awhile Cork

CORKY
Five years two months sixteen days
How you doing Sue

Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it

SUE
Like shit Now that were all caught
up how about a drink

Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old
CORKY
Thanks
They click the bottles together and drink

SUE
You got a job yet

CORKY
Yeah Some plumbing painting and
shit
Sue laughs

SUE
I mean a J-O-B A real job

CORKY
Not for me Sue Im straight and
narrow Im just here to get laid
or drunk and hopefully both

Corky gets off the stool

CORKY
Thanks for the beer

Looking around she sees a woman alone at one of the

back
tables Through the smoky din she bears a slight
resemblance
to Violet
The woman is dressed all in black including a leather
jacket
Smiling Corky slides into the chair beside her There
is
no one smoother
CORKY
Hi
WOMAN
Hello
CORKY
You know that outfit would look
great on my bedroom floor
The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the
shoulder
She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a
woman
in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket She is more
wide

than fat

WOMAN COP
Hey Jesse Whats happening here

CORKY
Nothing yet

WOMAN COP
Whos this

Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips A

service
revolver is clipped to her belt
She squints at Corky her head nodding in recognition
WOMAN COP
Wait I know you
CORKY
I dont think so
WOMAN COP
I didnt know you were out
Corky smiles at the woman in black
CORKY
When you get tired of Cagney and
Lacey come find me
She heads for the exit
EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT
The neighborhood would be politely described as
rough
Corkys truck does not stand out parked alone on the
littered
street
INT CORKYS APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is a hole but it is home
Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling
a
beer resting on her stomach a folk singer quietly
croons
from the radio
We see the ceiling a circle of light hovering over the
small
desk lamp We move in on the spot which slowly fills
up

the screen until there is nothing but the white light
cuts a

become

when

curious

She

Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint

swath across the ceiling
MATCH CUT TO

INT EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

Corky is painting the ceiling The folk ballad has

an angry Riot Grrrl anthem

She is working hard the roller sucking back and forth

Sweat covers her face

Dropping the roller down she reloads it in the tray

the phone rings She stops and answers it
CORKY
Hello Oh hi Mr Bianchinni
yes everything is going fine I

got the tub drain all cleaned out
She listens for a moment

CORKY
What apartment

She glances at the main wall

CORKY

All right all right I guess I could

take a look Yeah youre welcome
goodbye

She hangs up and looks again at the wall feeling

INT HALL - NIGHT

Corky knocks and after a moment Violet opens the door

seems surprised

VIOLET

Oh no Shit I didnt know he would

call you God you must think Im
a total nuisance

CORKY
Not exactly
VIOLET
Im sorry I usually would call
Rajeev but I didnt know what to do
so I called Mr Bianchinni

CORKY
He said you lost something

VIOLET
Yeah come on in

She steps back and Corky walks inside
INT CAESARS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Violet leads her through the apartment It is

expensively
furnished with very masculine tastes a lot of gray and
black
leather
VIOLET
I was doing some dishes and just as
I pulled the stopper my earring fell
in
Corky looks at her blankly
VIOLET
Its one of my favorites Thats
why I got upset I know it probably
seems ridiculous to you
An eyebrow goes up
VIOLET
Im sorry look forget it I
shouldnt have called
CORKY
I told Bianchinni I would take a
look Is it that sink
Violet nods
She opens the sink cabinet and pulls out a pair of
channel
locks from her back pocket The teeth of the channel
locks

open and bite onto the pressure nut
CORKY
Do you have a pot or a bucket

VIOLET
Sure

She hands one down to her Corky slides it under the

curved

pipe

As she works Corky feels herself staring at Violet at
the

hem of her dress curving tightly around her thighs

Water begins to trickle into the pan

The nut slides loose and Corky tips the trap Water
splashes

into the pan with a soft metal tink

VIOLET
Did you find it

Corky fishes into gray water and pulls out the earring

Violet screams a huge smile on her face half-falling
as

she tries to hug Corky

VIOLET
I cant believe it You did it

Corky leans back under and replaces the trap

VIOLET
Thank you so much You have to let
me pay you something --

CORKY
No Mr Bianchinni asked me to do
it I did it

Corky checks the drain by running the water
VIOLET
If you wont take money how about a
drink Its getting late You cant
work all night

Corky eyes her for a moment

CORKY
Okay one drink

VIOLET
What do you want

CORKY
A beer

VIOLET
A beer Of course

She smiles and turns to the bar

VIOLET
Sit down

Corky sits on the black leather couch and Violet
returns
with two bottles of Heineken Corky sneers

VIOLET
Thanks again

They clink the bottles and swig

VIOLET
You seem uncomfortable Do I make
you nervous Corky

CORKY
No

She looks at Violet then takes another long pull on
the
bottle

VIOLET
Thirsty maybe

Violet smiles her eyes again talking for her

CORKY
Curious maybe

VIOLET
Curious Thats funny Im feeling
a bit curious myself right now

Violet notices the tattoo on Corkys arm

VIOLET
Thats a great tattoo
She reaches over and touches it

VIOLET
Beautiful labrys

Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is She

nods
rubbing it as if trying to hide it
VIOLET
Are you surprised that I know what
it is
CORKY
Maybe
VIOLET
I have a tattoo would you like to
see it
She moves closer sliding over the leather cushions as
she
opens the front of her dress
VIOLET
A woman in upstate New York did it
for me
She is not wearing a bra
VIOLET
Here Do you like it
Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a
bright

green-stemmed violet

VIOLET
It took her all day to do it She
promised me it wouldnt hurt but it
was sore for a long time after I
couldnt even touch it

Corky looks up from Violets breast to her dark eyes

VIOLET
But now I love the way it feels

She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred
skin
takes

thumb

Corky

down her

dress

VIOLET
Here touch it

Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet
her hand and places it on her breast

CORKY
What are you doing

Violet looks at her
VIOLET

Isnt it obvious Im trying to
seduce you

CORKY
Why
VIOLET
Because I want to Ive wanted to

since I first saw you in the elevator
Corky watches her trying to figure her out even as her
presses into Violets nipple
Inhaling sharply Violet closes her eyes she can feel
staring at her
VIOLET
You dont believe me But I can
prove it to you
She takes Corkys wrist and begins pulling her hand
body
VIOLET
You cant believe me because of what
you see
She forces Corkys hand between her legs up under her
VIOLET
But you can believe what you feel

Violet opens her eyes a wanton smile on her lips

VIOLET
You see Ive been thinking about
you all day

Corkys forearm flexes and Violet moans
With both hands Violet takes hold of Corkys forearm

CORKY
You planned this whole thing

Violets head swims she is unable to breathe

CORKY
You dropped that earring down the
drain on purpose didnt you

VIOLET
If I say yes will you take your
hand away

CORKY
No

VIOLET
yes

Now it is Corky who smiles

Violet shivers her thighs rubbing her hips thrusting

against
Corkys hand
VIOLET
Please Corky please
Her eyes barely open
VIOLET
kiss me
In a single motion Corky takes hold of the back of her
neck
and covers Violets open mouth with her own
With her hand still stuffed between Violets legs
Corky

lays her back onto the couch as the kiss becomes more -

More desperate more hungry until --

We hear the front door unlock and open
CAESAR
Violet

Violets eyes pop open and she pushes Corky back

CAESAR
Violet you home

They scramble to compose themselves

VIOLET
Yeah In here C

He comes around the corner and in the dim light sees
the two
figures sitting close on the couch

CAESAR
Whats this

He mistakes Corky for a man

CAESAR
What the fuck is this

Violet stands as Caesar barrels toward the couch

VIOLET
I didnt expect --

CAESAR
What the fuck is going on

Corky stands and turns Caesar suddenly realizing that
she
is a woman

CAESAR
Oh shit

VIOLET
Caesar this is Corky Corky Caesar

CAESAR
Im sorry Christ I thought

He reaches to the wall for the lights

VIOLET
She is working for Bianchinni
Caesar extends his hand

CAESAR
Oh right right Don mentioned

family

Corky shakes his hand

CAESAR

CORKY

VIOLET

CAESAR

He looks at her as if he knows something

CAESAR

Corky shakes her head

CAESAR

CAESAR
Not bad What for

VIOLET

CAESAR

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a thick fold

of

money and peels several hundreds Corky stares at it

CAESAR
Come on come on if you understand

to take the money if you dont
Im going to have to worry about

Corky takes it Caesar smiles

INT

through and

the

in

when

Close on the paintbrush Corkys fingers pushing
separating the black bristles under the running water
When the brush is clean she flicks it dry and resets
edge

She goes to the sink to wash her hands when she stops
noticing her left hand

It is the hand that was between Violets legs
She is about to smell her finger when she sees herself
the mirror

CORKY
What are you doing

She drops her hand
CORKY
What am I doing Im fucking up
thats what Im doing
She scrubs her hands clean

EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

It is late the area burnished with amber street light
Corky walks from the building to her truck

She climbs inside and slides the key into the ignition
suddenly the passenger door opens and --
Violet gets in Stunned Corky stares at her

VIOLET
I had to see you

CORKY
Look I dont think this is a good
idea

VIOLET

I wanted to apologize

CORKY
Dont apologize please I cant
stand women who apologize for wanting
cant

panting

Violet smiles

VIOLET
Im not apologizing for what I did --

She slides across the seat
VIOLET
Im apologizing for what I didnt
do
She kisses Corky and if Corky is trying to resist we
tell
The windshield is beginning to steam when Violet

breaks the kiss

VIOLET
Do you have a bed somewhere

Unable to speak Corky reaches over and starts the

INT CORKYS APARTMENT - NIGHT
The sex

There is nothing flower-scented or out-of-focus about

t is sweaty slippery body-grinding bed-squeaking

sex -—

Pungent and potent --
And when it is over neither woman can move
Finally Corkys eyes flutter open

CORKY
I can see again

Violet smiles
Slowly Corky gets up and goes to the fridge She

beer and presses it to her sweating forebead
can

returns to

After a moment she lowers it gently pressing the cold
elsewhere Eyes closed she lets out a long Ahh
Violet hears the sizzle-pop of the beer as Corky

the bed

She holds the beer to Violets lips and tilts the can
watching Violets throat as she drinks

Violets eyes open

VIOLET
I needed that

CORKY
Tell me about it

Corky hands her the beer as Violet sits up a bit

CORKY
Caesars Mafia isnt he

VIOLET
You have to ask

CORKY
No

VIOLET
Funny nobody calls it that anymore
Caesar calls it The Business

CORKY
How did you meet him

VIOLET
They took over a club I was working
at Caesar started managing it

CORKY
Hes a launderer

VIOLET
Basically

CORKY
How long have you been with him

VIOLET
Almost five years

CORKY
Five years is a long time

VIOLET
Yes it is

Corky stares at her beer She knows what Violet is
thinking

CORKY
The redistribution of wealth

VIOLET
What

CORKY
snt that what you wanted to know
What I did time for

VIOLET
he redistribution of wealth

CORKY
hats what I tell someone when Im
trying to get them in my bed

-

VIOLET
m already in your bed

CORKY
My cellmate would say she did her
time for getting caught She was
always more honest than me

Corky sips her beer

CORKY
I started stealing when I was little
We were piss-poor which is not an
excuse just a fact

It isnt like her to talk about this especially with
someone
she just met

CORKY
The first time I remember so vividly
A bunch of us kids were at Waxmans
Drugstore when Mr Waxman who was
a mean old prick always worrying
about us robbing him dropped a roll
of quarters

We can almost hear the coins tinkling on the tile
floor

CORKY
I can still hear that sound those
quarters because right then something
clicked inside of me Some instinct
took over and as everyone including
Waxman dove down I reached up and
emptied the cash register

Violet smiles She likes this woman

CORKY
I gave most of the money to my mom
I told her I found it at the
trainyard She was so happy she
cried calling me her lucky charm
Fifteen years later I guess my luck
ran out

Sbe swallows that with beer

CORKY
Sometimes I tell myself that I didnt
have a choice that stealing was
surviving Usually I can admit thats
bullshit I did it because it was a
way out It was easy and I was good
at it real good

She glances at Violet

CORKY
I dont usually talk this much I
guess I have been rehabilitated

Violet laughs

VIOLET
You didnt have to tell me if you
didnt want to

CORKY
I guess I wanted to

VIOLET
Im glad you did

Corky gets out of her truck carrying her tools

Between the main doors she sees a man His name is

He is very nervous talking to someone through the
SHELLY
I know hes gone Please I have

Fiddling with her keys Corky recognizes the voice that
answers him

VIOLET (VO)
What do you want Shelly

Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky answering in
hushed voice

SHELLY

I have to leave Tonight

For a moment the intercom is silent Then the door

and Shelly pushes inside Corky follows him to the

INT ELEVATOR - DAY

Corky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger
circular saw

Shelly hides behind his sunglasses watching the

numbers go up The doors open and he scurries out
INT HALL - DAY

She watches him enter Caesars apartment her smile now
completely gone

INT EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

It is later Through the wall we listen to the same

sound

as before of two people making love We drop down and
find

Corkys brush still wet with paint abandoned in her
tray

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Her face glistening with sweat Violet climaxes
letting the
orgasm spread through her like melting butter

VIOLET
I had this image of you inside of

me

She flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her

pelvis
VIOLET
Like a part of me
As she opens her eyes we see that her lover is Corky
Violet
watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get
dressed
VIOLET
You are so beautiful
Corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on
Violet

sits up She can feel that something is wrong

VIOLET
Whats wrong

CORKY
Nothing

Violet pulls the sheet around her

VIOLET
Yes there is I felt it this morning
when I brought you the coffee

CORKY
Shit here we go

VIOLET
You didnt want to see me did you

CORKY
If there is one thing I cant stand
about sleeping with women its all
the fucking mind reading

VIOLET
What are you afraid of

CORKY
Im not afraid of anything

VIOLET
I dont understand -

CORKY
I know You cant understand because
were different Violet Were
different

VIOLET
Were not that different Corky

CORKY
How can you sit in that bed and say
that

VIOLET
Because its the truth

CORKY
Let me guess This is where you
tell me that what matters is on the
inside That inside you there is a
little dyke just like me

VIOLET
Oh no shes nothing like you Shes

a lot smarter than you

CORKY
Is that what her daddy tells her

VIOLET
I know what I am I dont need to
have it tattooed on my shoulder

CORKY
What are you saying That you dont
have sex with men

VIOLET
I dont

CORKY
For Christs sake Violet I heard
you Thin walls remember

VIOLET
What you heard wasnt sex

CORKY
What the fuck was it

VIOLET
All my life everyone has been telling
me that when I have sex Im not
really having sex Not real sex
But theyre wrong I know what is
and isnt sex and what you heard was
definitely not sex

CORKY
What was it then

VIOLET
Work

That knocks Corky back

VIOLET
You made certain choices in your
life that you paid for You said
you made them because you were good
at something and it was easy Do
you think youre the only one thats
good at something

Violet stare pins Corky to the wall

VIOLET
We make our own choices and we pay
our own prices I think were more

alike than you want to admit

CORKY
What about that guy this morning

VIOLET
You mean Shelly

CORKY
Dont tell me youre a workaholic

VIOLET
No Shelly knows what I am He saw
me in a bar with another woman

CORKY
I suppose he just wants to watch

Thats all Violet can take

VIOLET
Fuck it I think you better leave

CORKY
I think so too

Violet turns away
VIOLET
Try not to steal anything on the way
out
That stings but Corky walks out without looking back
INT EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is dark now Corky is standing above the paint tray
that
has skinned over She picks up the brush It is dry
with

She throws the brush across the room

The rusty Chevy glides to a stop in a parking space
service entrance In its payload is a boxed bathroom

Corky climbs out of the cab and into the back
bungee cords that hold down the boxes
She looks up as a black Lincoln Town Car screeches into

spot not far from her truck THREE SERIOUS-LOOKING MEN

out leading a fourth Shelly

He is the only one who seems to notice Corky
They enter the building the door closing behind them
INT BATHROOM - DAY

Corkys legs jut out from the old wicker vanity as she
finishes detaching its anchors and pipe work
She stands giving it a yank and pulling it away from

wall when voices begin to filter in from the next-door
apartment

She listens - a rising string of warbling sobs drowned
by an angry voice

ANGRY VOICE
Shut the fuck up You piece of shit

We hear a scream

ANGRY VOICE

Youre going to tell us Youre
going to fuckin tell us just a
matter of fuckin time

Each sentence is punctuated with grunts and thuds

ANGRY VOICE

Where is it Where the fuck is it

We begin to close in on Corky as she listens to each
struck

CUT TO

the

ANGRY VOICE
You shit You piece of shit

With each thud the water in the toilet shimmers like a
cymbal As we move closer the sound swells until --

MATCH

Where blood splatters the toilet heavy drops hitting
water and spreading like inverted mushroom clouds
ANGRY VOICE
Did that hurt News flash fucko

The angry voice belongs to JOHNNIE MARZZONE Shelly is
kneeling in front of the toilet hands tied behind his

with electrical wire
Johnnie Marzzone is a flashy young man in Armani
silk shirt and silver-tipped cowboy boots His tie is
in as if torture were a fine-dining experience
Caesar and two other men are crammed in the small
JOHNNIE

Shelly screams as Jobnnie repeatedly rams his face into
toilet
CAESAR
Whoa whoa Come on hes making

too much noise

JOHNNIE

CAESAR
Here put this in his mouth

Caesar hands a towel to Johnnie who stuffs it into

Shellys
mouth
INT CAESARS APARTMENT - DAY
Like Corky Violet can hear the beating She is trying
to
block it out but cannot
Standing at the bar she runs the blender grinding ice
cubes
trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom
The bathroom door opens
JOHNNIE
Prick I can go all night All
night
Caesar steps out shutting the door masking the sounds
behind

him Violet moves toward him

VIOLET
Caesar Im leaving

CAESAR
What Oh come on I didnt use one
of the good towels

The door opens again as someone else steps out
VIOLET
Caesar Im serious This is too

CAESAR
Why Cause you know him

She nods

CAESAR
You women are so fucking sensitive

He takes hold of her

CAESAR
But I dont want you to go I like

He embraces her Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY

MALNANO
in the hallway staring at her
He is an older man hair graying built like a
fireplug
Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit
CAESAR

MICKEY

CAESAR

psycho
Mickey continues to stare at Violet who looks up at
him
with her big doe eyes
MICKEY
Caesar didnt I tell you to get

CAESAR

He goes to the kitchen
Mickey moves closer to Violet lifting her chin the way
a

father would do to his little girl

Violet watches them return to the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - DAY

Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man
LOU He slaps Johnnie on the back

MICKEY

JOHNNIE

Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror carefully Then

begins putting on the rings he had removed for the

Mickey kneels down next to Shellys ear and motions to

who lifts Shellys bound arms

MICKEY
Shelly Im going to ask you ten
times You understand Ten times

Mickey grabs Shellys pinky finger putting it between
metal blades

MICKEY
One Where is our money

Shelly whimpers red-faced and sobbing There is a
crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky

finger
bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather
footwear
CAESAR
Aw Christ
We hear Caesar retrieve a tissue and his hand enters
the
frame scooping up the pinky
He plunks the severed finger into the toilet and it
sinks to
the bottom
Caesar drops the toilet seat down and flushes
INT BATHROOM - EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY
Corky cant stand it anymore She throws her tools
down
leaves the bathroom and finds --
Violet waiting in the main room Both women stand
apart in
silence
Violet seems on the verge of saying something but
doesnt
know how to start Her lip begins to quiver her eyes
search
the room returning to Corky each time
The violence in the next room can still be heard
CORKY
Violet Are you all right
Almost unnoticeably Violet shakes her bead Corky
puts her
arm around her
CORKY
Come on Lets go
INT BAR - DAY
It is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the
afternoon

Dark wood and padded leather
The bartender joking with a cluster of men does not
notice
Corky as she moves up to the bar

CORKY
Excuse me

The bartender glances over

CORKY
Draft beer and a TNT

Corky eyes the men who stare into their drinks

The bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in
front of
her

Corky heads for her table ignoring the whispers and
snickers

Corky and Violet the only women in the room sit close
together at a far corner table

Violets voice is hushed

VIOLET
Shelly was skimming from the business
He came to see me yesterday because
he was afraid Caesar figured it out
He wanted to run but he wanted me to
come with him

CORKY
Even though he knew about you

VIOLET
Yes

CORKY
He was in love with you right

VIOLET
Thats what he told himself But it
wasnt even about me it was about
Caesar He wanted what Caesar had
Thats how they are I understand
them

She glances around the room a man at the bar smiles at
her
VIOLET
For Shelly taking the money was a
way to take from Caesar He could
have run at any time but he didnt
because he didnt want out

CORKY
Sounds like he wanted to get caught

VIOLET
Maybe he did He would brag to me
all the time He was never afraid
of Caesar because he didnt know
him Not like I do

Two men sit down near them laughing

VIOLET
Caesar lives for these moments He
tells me its just the business but
I know its more than that He likes
it The violence Ill catch him
in the bathroom mirror touching his
scars He says they remind him who
he his Theyre all like that
Except maybe Mickey

CORKY
Mickey

VIOLET
Hes the part of the business that
the rest of them pretend to be
But Mickey doesnt like it like
they do I suppose thats why hes
good at it

Violet stares at her glass at the melting ice

She downs

VIOLET
I used to be able to block it out
I would tell myself that I wasnt
really there so nothing really
mattered But I cant do it anymore

the last of her drink

VIOLET
Ive been making the same mistake
Shelly made But now I know what I
want
glances

are

She turns to Corky

VIOLET
I want out I want a new life I
see what Ive been waiting for but
I need you Corky

CORKY
For what

VIOLET
You made a choice once Do you think
you would make that same choice again

CORKY
What choice

VIOLET
If those quarters fell to the floor
would you still reach up to that
cash register

Corky stares at her knowing where this is going

around the crowded bar

CORKY
Not here

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

Corkys truck sits in a gravel parking lot

INT CORKYS TRUCK - DAY

Through the back window of the truck Violet and

silhouettes against the street light

VIOLET
Caesar is going to get the money and
bring --

CORKY

How much money

VIOLET
Shelly said it was over two million
dollars

Corky quietly swallows that pill It begins to

She

Corky

rain
VIOLET
Caesar will bring it to the apartment
to count and go through Shellys
books to figure out how he did it

CORKY
Wait a minute Wait a minute Do
you have any idea what you are saying
You are asking me to help you fuck
the mob

Violet nods

CORKY
These people are serious Violet
If you want to know how serious ask
Shelly Theyre worse than any cop
because they have lots of money and
no rules You fuck them youve got
to do it right

VIOLET
Thats why I need your help You
said you were good

CORKY
I am but

She knows Violet is challenging her

CORKY
All right lets say for the moment
that I believe everything you are
saying

VIOLET
You think Im lying

CORKY
I didnt say that but since you
did lets say that you are It
would have been easy to set Shelly
up You could have got him killed
knowing that Caesar would bring the
money to the apartment

Violet stares her face poker-blank

CORKY
All you would need to keep yourself
clean would be someone unconnected
someone like me
VIOLET
Is that what you think

CORKY
Im just making a point You have
no idea what youre asking How
much trust two people need to do
something like this

She moves closer to Violet the sound of the rain
beating
against the metal cab

CORKY
For me stealing is a lot like sex
Two people that want the same thing
sit in a room and they talk they
start to plan and its like flirting
a kind of foreplay because the more
they talk about it the wetter they
get

She stops

CORKY
The difference is I can have sex
with someone I just met someone I
hardly know but to steal I need to
know someone like I know myself

VIOLET
Do you think you know me like that

CORKY
I think

They are close enough to kiss

CORKY
Were going to find out

Corky pulls back

CORKY
But first I want to see this money

INT CAESARS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes
open
Caesar charging in He is doubled over clutching

something
to his stomach
He rushes to the kitchen dumping a bloody bundle into
the
double sink There is blood everywhere smeared up and
down
Caesars front
VIOLET
Oh my God
Violet takes a step toward him unsure of what has
happened
CAESAR
Dont worry It aint mine
He pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the
cupboard

VIOLET
Caesar what happened

CAESAR
It was unbelievable Un-fucking-
believable

He pours himeslf a shot belting it back

CAESAR
Goddammit look at this shirt Its
ruined

He begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt

CAESAR
It started when Shelly took us to
the money I tell you Mickey Malnato
knows his shit he does Shelly
takes us right there

He throws down another shot

CAESAR
So Shellys down on his knees and
hes pulling out this bag of money
from a safe in the floor and Im
staring at it like holy fuck I
mean look at it --
He tears open the bloody bag wet money bricks spilling
out

CAESAR
And all I can think is how the fuck
did he do this when - Bang Johnnie
caps him Blood sprays everywhere
all over the money Weve no idea
if this is even all of it

Caesar is exasperated

CAESAR
And right then I go through the roof
and - Boom I belt the dumb fuck as
hard as I can I didnt care whose
son he was I just wanted to hit him
again Knock some sense into that
dumb son of a bitch

He looks at the pile of bloody money

CAESAR
Just look at this mess I got to deal
with

VIOLET
What are you going to do with it

CAESAR
I told them to run it through the
cycles But I guess Gino has plans
for it because hes coming here
tomorrow night to pick this shit up

Searching through a sink cabinet he cant find what he
needs

CAESAR
Where the hells the laundry
detergent

VIOLET
Ummm in the linen closet

Caesar walks down the ball to the bathroom Violets
eyes
do not move from the pile of money

Corky seems to come from nowhere She whispers

CORKY
that

limbs

fighting

hear

Come to my place in the morning
Early okay

Violet nods

INT CLOSET - NIGHT

Corkys hands twitch and then flex against the ropes
bind them

A reflex echoes through her body muscles spasm and
jerk against their bonds

As if in a dream she struggles trying to get free
toward the edge of consciousness until --

She seems to succumb slipping back into stillness
We move toward her face her closed eyes as we again
the voices in her head

VIOLET (VO)
Youre having second thoughts

INT CORKYS APARTMENT - DAY
Violet is on the bed Corky at the window

CORKY

VIOLET
He hung it up

CORKY
What
CUT TO

bills

VIOLET
To let it dry

She begins to focus on the memory

VIOLET
It was unreal

Moving in on her face

MATCH

Benjamin Franklins face on a hundred-dollar bill
INT CAESARS APARTMENT - NIGHT
Franklins face rotates as we pull back seeing rows of
carefully paper-clipped to lines of string
VIOLET (VO)
Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere
like leaves
Eyes filled with green Violet turns inside the laundry
of money until she sees Caesar
Wearing his undershirt he is across the room standing
the ironing board ironing every single bill
He seems to have one eye on her one eye on his work
VIOLET (VO)
Then one by one he ironed all of
it
He sprays starch across several bills and presses the

iron to them

CORKY (VO)
Did he sleep

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT
Violet is in bed unable to sleep listening to the

shuffle of Caesars bill counter
VIOLET (VO)
No But neither did I

We move past her floating toward the wall
VIOLET (VO)
All night long I listened to that
sound

INT OFFICE - NIGHT

We drift across Caesars desk past bricks of bound

bills
as Caesar folds the paper tape around another stack
CORKY (VO)
What sound
He hits the counter again and we hear the sound now
very
loud as hundreds blur by fluttering beneath us
VIOLET (VO)
The sound of money
The sound rolls into thunder --
INT CORKYS APARTMENT - DAY
That seems to shake the apartment
CORKY
And where is it now
VIOLET
In his office I saw it this morning
INT OFFICE - DAY
Violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of
coffee
Working furiously at the computer Caesar jumps when he
sees
her bloodshot eyes animal-wide
He checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of
him

VIOLET
I need to go to the store
He nods automatically back in his work as she sees

the
briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds
VIOLET (VO)
Its in a case on his desk
CORKY (VO)
Does the case lock
We see the open top with its silver flip-over locks
INT CORKYS APARTMENT - DAY
Violet is trying to remember
VIOLET
Yes
CORKY
Good
Corky begins to pace ordering the information in her
head

CORKY
All right now tell me about Johnnie

VIOLET
Johnnie

CORKY
It sounded like he and Caesar dont
like each other

VIOLET
Like each other They hate each
other

CORKY
Why

VIOLET

It started way before I was around
I think basically its because he
thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot
But Johnnie runs Chicago because
Gino is his father

CORKY
Who is Gino
looks at

Violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake

VIOLET
Gino Marzzone

CORKY
Marzzone As in Angelo Marzzone

VIOLET

Corky covers her mouth

CORKY

Eyes wide she paces pulling at her lip mumbling
Suddenly she freezes as it clicks into place She

apartment Its a big deal isnt
it That means Caesar will be ready
He doesnt want to look like an idiot

first time he picked out the dress

VIOLET
Johnnie hits on anything in high
heels

CORKY
Has Caesar ever seen him

VIOLET
He does it right in front of him

CORKY
Its getting better and better
eep going

VIOLET
Gino doesnt know English or at

doesnt talk much He gets right to
the point Both times they talked
for about five minutes had one drink
and then they left

CORKY
What did Gino drink

VIOLET

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Caesar is working intensely on his fingernails We
over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools We see

nail

Through the open door we see Corky moving almost
across the living room

INT CORKYS APARTMENT - DAY

Corky is looking for something

When Im inside I will get the money

From her earlobe she chooses the right pick sliding
out
the silver tool

It takes only a second and the first lock pops open

She is working on the other lock when the door is
pushed
open and Caesar walks in

Corky drops down grasping for her gun --

As Caesar wearing only underwear enters He blows on
the

drying polish on his fingernails before delicately
selecting

a suit from his closet
The gun ready Corky pressed against the desk waits

until

toward the office

with two million clean

The words squeeze out like tears

He swings the swivel chair over his head and smashes it

down
on the desk Again and again

to
hide his tears

pumping the trigger

Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams falling
towards his father

Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit his gun
and sliding across the floor

Rising she peers over the edge of the bar

Caesar is standing in the aftermath His gun is still
at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over

The bodies are still blood silently pooling around

Blinking the sweat from his eyes Caesar sees Violet

is
afraid to even look at him
Blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards
Caesar tries to clear his head mopping the sweat from
his
face He bends down and starts searching Johnnies
pockets
He finds his keys
VIOLET
What are you doing
Lost in thought he goes to Gino Throwing open the
coat
he sees the airplane ticket There is a bullet hole in
it

He checks the times and then his watch

CAESAR

The money is gone

Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and
drip trail of the plastic bag

The tracks lead to the bathroom

money next to Corkys empty boots

Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a

pipe wrench

At the last second he is able to duck falling to the
as --

The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch
Before he can recover and shoot she brings the wrench
on his arm

He screams as the gun hits the floor

She kicks it sending it skidding hydroplaning across

swirls and spirals on the wood floor
