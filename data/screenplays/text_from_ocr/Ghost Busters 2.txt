A high AERIAL SHOT of the island features the

Statue of Liberty

prominently in the foreground then TRAVELS ACROSS the harbor OVER the
Battery and Lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village

EXT EAST 77TH STREET - DAY

A car is being hoisted up by a municipal tow truck while its owner is
having a terrible screaming arguement with a parking enforcement

officer
DANA BARRETT comes home pushing a baby buggy
bags of groceries and trying to dig her keys

struggling with two full
out of her purse The

building superintendent FRANK sees her struggling but pretends not to

notice

DANA
(exasperated)

Frank do you think you could give me a hand

FRANK
(reluctantly going to help)
Okay okay Its not my job but what the
hell Ill do you a favor He takes the

grocery bags from her

DANA

(setting the wheel brakes on

the buggy)

She continues digging in her purse while Frank leans over the buggy
and
makes funny faces at the baby OSCAR a very cute nine-month old boy

Neither of them notice the movement of the carriage

DANA

FRANK
Okay thats no problem

DANA

BUGGY WHEELS
The brakes unlock themselves

DANA

She reaches for the handlebar of the buggy but the buggy rolls
forward
just out of her reach and stops Surprised by the movement she
reaches

for the handlebar again but this time the buggy rolls away even
further Alarmed now Dana hurries after it but the buggy keeps
rolling down the street at ever increasing speed

SIDEWALK

Dana chases the buggy down the street shouting to passing pedestrians
for help but every time someone reaches out to stop it the buggy
swerves and continues unchecked

INTERSECTION

Cars trucks and buses speed by in both directions as the buggy races
toward the corner

DANA

She puts her head down and sprints after the buggy like an Olympian
EXT EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

A city bus is on a collision course with the speeding baby buggy
BUGGY

It careens toward the corner

EXT EAST 77TH STREET - BABY - DAY

Its eyes are wide open with excitement

EXT EAST 77TH STREET - INTERSECTION - DAY

Bus and buggy are closing fast as the buggy bounces over the curb and
into the crosswalk

BUS

The bus driver reacts in helpless horror as he sees the buggy enter
the

intersection at high speed

BUGGY

It comes to a dead stop right in the middle of the street The bus
continues missing the buggy by inches

INTERSECTION

Cars and trucks swerve and hit their brakes as Dana runs into the
intersection and snatches up the baby She hugs it close deeply
relieved then looks at the buggy with the dawning awareness that the
supernatural has re-entered her life

He turns the key again the ENGING TURNS OVER then starts GRINDING
and

CLUNKING disastrously chewing up vital parts and dropping twisted
bits

of metal onto the pavement Finally with a BLAST of black sooty
exhaust from the tailpipe Ecto-l shudders and dies Frustrated
Stantz

bangs his head lightly on the steering wheel

CUT TO
INT WKRR-TV STUDIO RECEPTION AREA - DAY (LATER)

A bank of monitors in the lobby show the program now running on WKRR
Channel 10 in New York We PUSH IN ON one of the monitors as a title
card and logo come up accompanied by some EERIE SYNTHESIZER MUSIC and
we return to the show in progress World of the Psychic with Dr
Peter

Venkman There is a video dissolve to a standard talk show set and
sitting there is our host PETER VENKMAN the renowned and somewhat
infamous ex-Ghostbuster

VENKMAN

He turns TO CAMERA and talks to his viewers in a suavely engaging
tone
understated and intimate

VENKMAN

Hi welcome back to the World of the Psychic
Im Peter Venkman and Im chatting with my guest
author lecturer and of course psychic Milton
Anglund

(to his guest)
Milt your new book is called The End of the
World Isnt that kind of like writing about
gum disease Yes it could happen but do you
think anybody wants to read a book about it

MILTON
Well I think its important for people to know
that the world is in danger

VENKMAN
Okay so can you tell us when its going to
happen or do we have to buy the book

MILTON
I predict that the world will end at the
stroke of midnight on New Years Eve

VENKMAN
This year Thats cutting it a little close
isnt it I mean just from a sales point of
view the book just came out right So youre
not even looking at the paperback release for
maybe a year And its going to be at least
another year after that if the thing has
movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential
You would have been better off predicting 1992
or even 94 just to be safe

MILTON
(irritated)
This is not just some money-making scheme I
didnt just make up the date I have a strong
psychic belief that the world will end on New
Years Eve

VENKMAN
(placating)
Well for your sake I hope youre right But
I think my other guest may disagree with you
Elaine you had another date in mind

The CAMERA REVEALS ELAINE an attractive aggressive New Jersey
housewife sitting on the other side of Venkman

ELAINE
According to my sources the world will end
on February 14 in the year 2016

VENKMAN
Valentines Day Thats got to be a bummer
Where did you get that date Elaine

ELAINE
I received this information from an alien I
was at the Paramus Holiday Inn I was having
a drink in the bar when he approached me and
started talking Then he must have used some
sort of ray or a mind control device because
he made me follow him to his room and thats
where he told me about the end of the world

VENKMAN
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn
ELAINE
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made
up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn I
cant be sure Peter

VENKMAN

(humoring her)
No you cant and I think thats the whole
problem with aliens you just cant trust them
You may get some nice ones occasionally like
Starman or ET but most of them turn out to
be some kind of lizard Anyway were just
about out of time

(does his wrap-up right TO

the CAMERA)
Next week on World of the Psychic hairless
pets

(holds up a hairless cat)
Until then this is Peter Venkman saying

(puts a finger to his temple

and sends out a though to his

viewers)

Good night

CUT TO
INT TV STUDIO - CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER)

Venkman comes out of the studio squabbling with his producer NORMAN

a
well-meaning young incompetent

VENKMAN
Where do you find these people I thought
we were having the telekinetic guy who bends
the spoons

NORMAN
A lot of the better psychics wont come on the
show They think youre too skeptical

VENKMAN
Skeptical Norman Im a pushover I think
professional wrestling is real

There is a small commotion down the hall as two plainclothes cops come
out of the next studio followed by a group of mayoral assistants

VENKMAN
(to Norman)
Whats all this

NORMAN
They just interviewed the mayor on Cityline

VENKMAN
The Mayor Hes a friend of mine

Venkman starts down the hall as the MAYOR and his principal aide JACK
HARDEMEYER come walking out of the studio

VENKMAN

(calling to the Mayor)
Lenny

The Mayor sees Venkman blanches and hurries off pretending not to
know

him

VENKMAN
(starts to follow him)
Lenny Its Pete Venkman

The plainclothesmen cut Venkman off and Hardemeyer puts a heavy hand
against Venkmans chest

HARDEMEYER
(snide)
Can I help you

VENKMAN
(dangerous)
Yeah you can get your hand off my chest

Hardemeyer smiles and drops his hand

HARDEMEYER
Im Jack Hardemeyer Im the mayors assistant
What can I do for you

VENKMAN
Im an old friend of the mayors I just
want to say hello to him

HARDEMEYER
(scornful)
I know who you are Doctor Venkman Busting
any ghosts lately

VENKMAN
No thats what I want to talk to the mayor
about We did a little job for the city a
while back and we ended up getting sued
screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you

HARDEMEYER

(bristling)
Look you stay away from the mayor Next fall
barring a disaster hes going to be elected
governor of this state and the last thing we
need is for him to be associated with two-bit
frauds and publicity hounds like you and your
friends You read me

Hardemeyer walks off with the two cops

VENKMAN
Okay I get it But I want you to tell Lenny
that because of you Im not voting for him

EXT MANHATTAN MUSEUM OF ART - DAY

The broad front steps of the museum are crowded with tourists and
visitors Dana arrives carrying a portfolio and artists tackle box
and

enters the museum

INT MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (LATER)

We are FULL-FRAME ON a larger-than-life full-figure portrait of VIGO
THE CARPATHIAN a demented and sadistic 16th century despot with an
incredibly powerful evil presence Then we PULL BACK to reveal the
studio which is a large open space on the top floor of the museum
lit

by large skylights in the ceiling Working on the Vigo painting is
JANOSZ POHA a youngish art historian and painter the head of the
department quirky intense and somewhat creepy Janosz is staring
longingly across the room at Dana

DANA

She is carefully cleaning a 19th Century landscape painting still
preoccupied by the extraordinary near-accident with the buggy Janosz
watches her for a moment then comes up behind her and looks over her
shoulder

JANOSZ
(with an East European accent)

Still working on the Turner

Dana jumps startled by the intrusion
DANA
Oh yes I got in a little late this morning

Janosz

JANOSZ
You know you are really doing very good work
here I think soon you may be ready to assist

me in some of the more important restorations

DANA
Thank you Janosz Ive learned a lot here
but now that my babys a little older I was
hoping to rejoin the orchestra

VIGO PAINTING

At the mention of Danas baby the figure of Vigo miraculously turns
his
head and looks at Dana

JANOSZ AND DANA
Neither of them notice the movement in the painting

JANOSZ
(disappointed)
Well be very sorry to lose you Perhaps I
could take you to lunch today

DANA
Actually Im not eating lunch today I have
an appointment
(looks at her watch)
In fact Id better go

She starts gathering up her things

JANOSZ
Every day I ask you and every day youve got
something else to do Do I have bad breath
or something

DANA
(trying to brush him off)

Im sorry Perhaps some other time

JANOSZ
Okay Ill take a raincheck on that

Janosz smiles at her as she exits then goes back to his easel
JANOSZ

EXT UNIVERSITY - DAY

Dana Barrett crosses the quad and enters a modern building A sign

identifies it as

The Institute for Advanced Theoretical Research

INT UNIVERSITY - DAY (A LITTLE LATER)

Dana is explaining the buggy incident to EGON SPENGLER the soberly

intellectual techno-wizard and former Ghostbuster

as he conducts an

experiment assisted by a research team of graduate students all of

whom

are Japanese Chinese or Korean The device he is testing is a black

box about the size of a Sony Watchman with both digital and graphic

displays

DANA

and then the buggy just suddenly stopped
dead in the middle of the street

SPENGLER
Did anyone else see this happen

DANA
Hundreds of people Believe me I didnt
imagine this

SPENGLER
Im not saying you did In science we always
look for the simplest explanation

An ASSISTANT interrupts

ASSISTANT
Were ready Dr Spengler

SPENGLER
(to the Assistant)
Well start with the negative calibration

He picks up the device and prepares to test it
DANA
(curious)
What are you working on Egon

SPENGLER
Im trying to determine whether human
emotional states have a measurable effect on
the psychomagnetheric energy field Its a
theory Ray and I were working on when we had
to dissolve Ghostbusters

An assistant draws a curtain revealing a large picture window
actually

a two-way mirror that looks into a small waiting room Inside the
waiting room they can see but not hear a youngish couple having a
heated

arguement

SPENGLER

(to Dana)
They think theyre here for marriage
counseling Weve kept them waiting for two
hours and weve been gradually increasing the
temperature in the room

(checking a heat sensor)
Its up to 95 degrees at the moment Now my
assistant is going to enter and ask them if
theyd mind waiting another half-hour

As Spengler Dana and the research team watch the assistant enters
the

waiting room and tells the couple about the new delay They explode
with anger both at him and each other while Spengler monitors them
through the glass After recording his readings he returns to his
Assistant

SPENGLER
Well do the happiness index next
(to Dana)
Id like to bring Ray in on your case if
its all right with you

DANA

Okay whatever you think -- but not Venkman
SPENGLER

Oh no
DANA

(affectedly casual)
Do you ever see him
SPENGLER
Occasionally

DANA
How is he these days

SPENGLER
Venkman I think he was borderline for a
while there Then he crossed the border

DANA
Does he ever mention me

SPENGLER
No Not that I can recall

They move to another two-way mirror through which they can see a
lovely
little girl playing with a wonderful array of toys

DANA
(slightly disappointed)
Well we didnt part on very good terms and
we sort of lost track of each other when I
got married

The Assistant interrupts again

ASSISTANT
Were ready for the affection test

SPENGLER
(to the assistant)
Good Send in the puppy

DANA
(continuing)
I thought of calling him after my marriage
ended but -- Anyway I appreciate youre

doing this Egon

They watch as another assistant enters the playroom with an adorable
Cocker Spaniel puppy and gives it to the little girl Spengler
monitors

her as she jumps for joy and hugs the little dog

DANA
(handing him a card)
This is my address and telephone number
Will you call me

SPENGLER
Certainly

DANA
Egon Id rather you didnt mention any of
this to Peter if you dont mind

SPENGLER
I wont
DANA
Thank you
She shakes his hand and exits
SPENGLER

(to his assistant)
Now lets see how she reacts when we take
away the puppy

HONKING and whizzing past him and starts

like a traffic cop bringing traffic to a standstill Then he signals

for Dana Stantz and S

pengler to join him in the middle of the street

Is this the spot

DANA
A little to the left Right there Thats
where it stopped

Stantz reads the PKE meter

STANTZ
Nothing Not a trace

SPENGLER
Why dont we try the Giga-meter

VENKMAN
Whats that

STANTZ
Egon and I have been working on a gauge to
measure psychomagnetheric energy in GEVs -
giga electron volts

SPENGLER
Thats a thousand million electron volts

VENKMAN
I knew that

Spengler switches on the Giga-meter the device he was testing in the
lab and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy
stopped

The indicator goes right into the red zone and the DEVICE starts
CLICKING

WILDLY

STANTZ
I think we hit the honeypot boys Theres
something brewing under the street

DANA
(worried to Venkman)
Peter do you think maybe I have some genetic
problem or something that makes me vulnerable
to these supernatural things

VENKMAN
You mean like the time you got possessed and
turned into a monster terror dog No not
a chance Total coincidence

Am I right

coincidence theory

Venkman and Stantz arrive just in time wearing Con Ed hardhats doing
a
good imitation of a Consolidated Edison repairman

agreement)

SPENGLER
(with a right on fist)
Yo

The cops seem satisfied by the explanation

FIRST COP
Okay boys take it easy

They drive off Spengler breathes a great sigh of relief and starts
rubbing his sore shoulders

SPENGLER
You were supposed to help me with this

VENKMAN
You need the exercise

Stantz resumes JACKHAMMERING while Venkman and Spengler clear the
rubble from the hole Suddenly he hits metal They clear away
generations of paving material revealing an ornate iron manhole cover
The manhole cover bears a strange logo and the letters NYPRR

STANTZ
(examing it)
NYPRR What the hell -- Help me lift
this

They prey off the iron cover with crowbars uncovering a very dark and
very deep abyss

STANTZ
(shining a flashlight into
the hole)
Wow Its an old airshaft It just goes
forever

Spengler leans in with the giga-meter which is reading even higher
now

SPENGLER
Very intense We need a deeper reading
Somebody has to go down there

Venkman and Spengler both look at Ray

STANTZ
Thanks boys

They snap Stantz into a harness and lower him into the hole on a
strong

cable attached to a winch Ray calls out orders to them as he
descends

deeper and deeper

STANTZ (0S)
(his voice echoing in the
airshaft)
Keep going -- more -- more --

INT HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz rappels off the sides of the airshaft as he continues his
descent
in total darkness

STANTZ
(using a radio now)
Lower -- lower --
(to himself)
Gee this really is deep

Suddenly his feet kick thin air as he gets to the bottom of the
airshaft
and swings free in some kind of tunnel

STANTZ
(shouts)
Hold it Steady

He pulls a powerful flashlight from his utility belt and shines it
into

the tunnel below

INT VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZS POV - NIGHT
He is suspended near the top of a beautifully preserved chamber with
rounded polished tile walls ardorned with intricate colorfully
enameled

Art Nouveau mosaics A finely inlaid sign identifies it as VAN HORNE
STATION

STANTZ

He pans the walls with his flashlight admiring the excellent
tilework
and speaks quietly to Venkman and Spengler over his walkie-talkie

STANTZ
(reverently)
This is it boys the end of the line Van
Horne Station The old New York Pneumatic
ts still here

EXT EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)
Venkman has no idea what hes talking about

SPENGLER
(explaining)
The New York Pneumatic Railway It was an
experimental subway system Fan-forced
air-trains built around 1870

STANTZ
(over the walkie-talkie)
This is about as deep as you can go under
Manhattan without digging your own hole

SPENGLER
(to Stantz)
Whats the reading

INT VAN HORNE STATION - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Stantz shines his flashlight on the meter and whistles at the
extremely
high reading

STANTZ
(on the radio)
Off the top of the scale This place is
really hot Lower me to the floor

As Venkman and Spengler feed him some more cable he pans his
flashlight
down the wall of the station then onto the floor
STANTZ
(shouts)
Hold it Stop Whoa

INT VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZS POV - FLOOR - NIGHT

Below him is a river of bubbling seething glowing slime a veritable
torrent of disgusting ooze

As he stares into the foul effluent we become aware of the strangely
amplified and magnified sounds of great ENGINES THROBBING and pulsing
in

the bowels of the city of WATER RUSHING through pipes STEAM HISSING
through ducts the muffled RUMBLE of the SUBWAY and the ROAR of
TRAFFIC

and mixed with it all the unmistakable sounds of human conflict and
pain

-- VOICES SHOUTING in anger SCREAMING in fear GROANING in pain a
sad

and eerie symphony

INT VAN HORNE STATION - STANTZ - NIGHT

STANTZ
(ranting on the radio)
Oh my God Its a seething bubbling
psychic cess Interlocked tubes of plasm
crackling with negative GEVs Its glowing
and moving Its -- its a river of slime

STANTZ

He dangles from the end of the cable holding his feet up as high as
he

can He unhooks a device from his utility belt and pulls the trigger
on

it shooting out a long telescoping fishing-pole with a scoop on the
end

Reaching down he scoops up a sample of the slime and starts
retracting

the pole

SLIME

Suddenly a grotesque arm with a long skeletal fingers reaches up out
of

the slime and snatches at Stantzs dangling feet He jerks his legs
up

as several more arms poke up out of the slime and reach for him

STANTZ
(on the radio)
Haul me up Venkman Now

EXT EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Venkman and Spengler start hauling in the cable as a Con Ed
Supervisors

car drives up and behind it the same police car they saw earlier

A

burly SUPERVISOR gets out and crosses toward them followed by the two

cops

SUPERVISOR
(no nonsense)
Okay whats the story here

Venkman and Spengler stop pulling up the cable and Venkman tries the

belligerent worker ploy again only this time hes wearing a Nynex
hardhat

VENKMAN
What I got time for this We got three
thousand phones out in the Village and about
eight million miles of cable to check

SUPERVISOR
(not buying it)
The phone lines are over there
(points to the curb)

Venkman pops Spengler on the head

VENKMAN
I told ya

Stantz can be heard ranting over Venkmans walkie-talkie

STANTZ (0S)
(filtered)
Help Help Pull me up Its alive Its
eating my boots

Venkman switches off the walkie-talkie
FIRST COP

Venkman stares at the Cop for a long moment

VENKMAN
Gas leak
INT VAN HORNE STATION - SAME TIME

Stantz is hanging there looking down into the shaft at the slime
which
is now bubbling up the shaft after him

STANTZ
(shouting)
Get me out of here

Desperate now he kicks wildly and knocks loose a section of an old
rusting conduit

INT VAN HORNE STATION - BOTTOM OF THE SHAFT

The conduit falls on a heavy electrical transmission line ripping
through the cable with a SHOWER OF SPARKS

EXT EAST 77TH STREET - HOLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Venkman Spengler the cops and the supervisor all react to a bright
FLASH deep down in the hole and a SHOUT from Stantz

EXT EAST 77TH STREET - STREET - NIGHT

One by one all the streetlights go out then the lights on all the
buildings along East 77th street then the whole neighborhood blacks
out and finally the entire city is plunged into darkness

STANTZ (0S)
Sorry

INT DANA BARRETTS APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

She walks around in the dark lighting candles and placing them all
over

the living room Then she finds a transistor radio and turns it on
for

information about the blackout She listens to a special news report
for a moment then has a compelling impulse to go check on the baby
She crosses to the nursery carrying a candle and quietly opens the
door

and looks in Suddenly the DOORBELL RINGS scaring her half to death
Leaving the chain on the door she opens it a crack and sees Janosz
standing in the hall eerily lit by a red emergency spot at the end of
the hallway He looks slightly dazed and even creepier

DANA
(surprised)
Janosz

JANOSZ
Hello Dana I happened to be in the
neighborhood and I thought Id stop by to
see if everythings all right with you --
you know with the blackout and everything
Are you okay Is the baby all right

His affected concern is chilling She is frightened but conceals it
from him

DANA
(mechanically and cautiously)

JANOSZ

in

DANA
No everythings fine Honestly Thanks

JANOSZ

She closes the door behind him and double locks it then stands there
staring into the candlelight alone and afraid

INT HALLWAY OF DANAS BUILDING - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS ACTION)

Janosz stands there in semi-darkness then his eyes light up like
headlights and he walks off down the hall

CUT TO
INT COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - NEXT DAY

The JUDGE a rather sour-looking jurist of the old school calls the
court to order

JUDGE
I want to make one thing very clear before
we go any further The law does not recognize
the existence of ghosts and I dont believe
in them either so I dont want to hear a
lot of malarkey about goblins and spooks and
demons Were going to stick to the facts
in this case and save the ghost stories for
the kiddies Understood

PROSECUTOR

HARDEMEYER

on his way out of the courtroom

She continues
PROSECUTOR

Do you know what this equipment is used for

CON ED
(shrugs)
I dont know Catching ghosts I guess

PROSECUTOR
(to the Judge)
May I remind the court that the defendants
are under a judicial restraining order that
specifically forbids them from performing
services as paranormal investigators and
eliminators

JUDGE
So noted

PROSECUTOR
Now Mr Fianella can you identify the
substance in the jar on the table marked
Exhibit F

PROSECUTOR

She goes to the exhibit table and picks up a specimen jar containing
the
slime sample Stantz removed from the tunnel

CON ED
I been working underground for Con Ed for
27 years and I never saw anything like that
in my life We checked out that tunnel the
next day and we didnt find nothing If it
was down there they must have put it there

DEFENSE TABLE
Venkman and Spengler look at Stantz

STANTZ
(defensively)
Hey I didnt imagine it There must have
been ten thousand gallons of it down there

SPENGLER
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal
source
LOUIS
(nervously)
Should I say that
SPENGLER

I doubt that theyd believe us

Louis moans and goes back to his notes

WIPE TO
INT COURTROOM - WITNESS STAND - LATER
Venkman himself is on the stand and Louis is questioning him

LOUIS
So like you were just trying to help out
your old friend because she was scared and
you didnt really mean to do anything bad
and you really love the city and wont ever
do anything like this again right
The Prosecutor rises

PROSECUTOR
Objection your Honor Hes leading the
witness

JUDGE
The witness is leading him Sustained

LOUIS
Okay let me rephrase that question
(to venkman)
Didnt you once coach a basketball team for
underprivileged children

VENKMAN
Yes I did We were city champs

PROSECUTOR
Objection Irrelevant and immaterial

JUDGE
Sustained Mr Tully do you have anything
to ask this witness that may have some
bearing on this case

LOUIS
(to Venkman)
Do I

VENKMAN
No I think youve helped them enough already

LOUIS
(to the Judge)
No I guess not
(to the Prosecutor)
Your witness

and approaches the witness stand with relish

PROSECUTOR
So Dr Venkman please explain to the court
why it is you and your co-defendants took it
upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the
middle of the street

VENKMAN
Seventy-seventh and First Avenue has so many
holes already we didnt think anyone would
notice

The gallery laughs and the Judge gavels for order
JUDGE
Keep that up mister and Ill find you in
contempt

VENKMAN
Sorry your Honor but when somebody sets
me up like that I cant resist

PROSECUTOR
Ill ask you again Dr Venkman Why were
you digging the hole And please remember
that youre under oath

VENKMAN
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me
in but Im going to tell you the truth
There are things in this world that go way
beyond human understanding things that
cant be explained and that most people dont
want to know about anyway Thats where we
come in

PROSECUTOR
So what are you saying That the world of
the supernatural is your special province

VENKMAN
No I guess Im just saying that shit happens
and somebody has to deal with it

The spectators in the gallery cheer and the judge gavels for order

WIPE TO
INT COURTROOM - LATER

summation

JUDGE
Does the counsel for the defense wish to
make any final arguements

Louis rises

LOUIS
Your honor may I approach the bench

JUDGE
(impatient)
Yes
Louis crosses to the judges bench

LOUIS
(to the judge)
Can I have some of your water

JUDGE
Get on with it counselor

LOUIS

Your honor ladies and gentlemen of the --

(he remembers theres no

my clients frauds Okay the blackout was
a big problem for everybody I was stuck in
an elevator for about three hours and I had
to go to the bathroom the whole time but I
dont blame them because once I turned into
a dog and they helped me Thank you

He goes back to the defense table and sits down Stantz and Spengler

hang their heads

He stares at Louis

Venkman pats Louis on the back
SPENGLER

(to Louis)
Way to go Concise and to the point

astonished at his summation

JUDGE
Thats it Thats all you have to say

LOUIS
Did I forget something

He searches through a disorderly pile of notes

JUDGE
That was unquestionably the worst
presentation of a case Ive ever heard in a
court of law I ought to cite you for
contempt and have you disbarred As for
your clients Peter Venkman Raymond Stantz
and Egon Spengler on the charges of
conspiracy fraud and the willful destruction
of public property I find you guilty on all
counts I order you to pay fines in the
amount of 25000 each and I sentence you to
eighteen months in the city correctional
facility at Rykers Island

STANTZ
He sees the activity in the jar

STANTZ
Uh-oh shes twitchin

THE BENCH
The Judge continues

JUDGE
And on a more personal note let me go on
record as saying that there is no place in
decent society for fakes charlatans and
tricksters like you who prey on the
gullibility of innocent people Youre
beneath the contempt of this court And
believe me if my hands were not tied by the
unalterable fetters of the law a law which
has become in my view far too permissive and
inadequate in its standards of punishment
I would invoke the tradition of our
illustrious forebearers reach back to a
sterner purer justice and have you burned
at the stake

He hammers the bench with his gravel as the gallery erupts noisily
Then

he feels a LOW RUMBLING TREMOR in the courtroom

The slime starts to pulse and swell pushing up the lid on the jar

INT COURTROOM - GHOST BATTLE - DAY

Everybody is silent now as the rumbling increases All eyes turn to

APPARITIONS explode out of the specimen jar

JUDGE

He looks up in terror at the two huge apparitions looming above him
and
recognizes them immediately

JUDGE
(in horror)
Oh my God The Scoleri Brothers

SCOLERI BROTHERS

Big in life even bigger in death the ghostly Scoleri brothers seem
ten

feet tall They are strapped into electric chairs and on their heads
are

metal electrocution caps with live sparking electrical wires still
attached Twenty-five hundred volts of electricity shoot through
their

bodies as they start to break free of the leather restraints trying
to

get at the Judge

JUDGE

Holding his gavel like a pitiful weapon he crawls over to the defense
table where Venkman Stantz and Spengler are now crouched assessing
the

spectral intruders

JUDGE
(terrified)
Youve got to do something

VENKMAN
Who are they

JUDGE
Theyre the Scoleri Brothers I tried them
for murder They were electrocuted up at
Ossining in 48 Now they want to kill me

VENKMAN
Maybe they just want to appeal
SCOLERI BROTHERS

They break loose from the electric chairs then turn toward the
defense
table and BLAST it with HIGH-VOLTAGE FINGER-LIGHTNING

PROSECUTOR
She sprints for the door pursued by one of the Scoleri brothers
GHOSTBUSTERS

They jump to safety behind the rail of the jury box pulling the Judge
with them

VENKMAN
These boys arent playing around

JUDGE
(desperately)
Youve got to stop them Please

LOUIS
(thinking like a lawyer)
Violating a judicial restraining order could
expose my clients to serious criminal
penalties As their attorney Id have to
advise them against it

SCOLERI BROTHERS

They start punching through the jury box
JUDGE

He is just about hysterical with fear

JUDGE
All right All right Im recinding the
order Case dismissed
(he pounds his gavel on
the floor)
Now do something

STANTZ
Lets go to work boys

With that the Ghostbusters leap over the rail of the jury box and
dash
across the courtroom to the exhibit table where their proton packs
were
being displayed as evidence They strap them on hastily as the
Brothers
continue tearing up the seats looing for the Judge

VENKMAN
(slinging the pack onto
his back)
Geez I forgot how heavy these things are

STANTZ
(grabbing other gear)
Okay lets heat em up

They flip the power switches on their packs and draw their particle
throwers

STANTZ
All right throwers Set for full neutronas
on stream

They switch on their throwers and turn to face the raging phantasms
SCOLERI BROTHERS

They are just about to wipe out the Judge when a loud shout distracts
them

VENKMAN
Hey Why dont you pick on someone your own
size

The towering ghosts turn in a fury and raise their arms ready to
shoot
lightning at their new adversaries

STANTZ
(to the others)
On my signal boys Open em up -- Now

They all pull their triggers and the wands EXPLODE with incredible
powerful STREAMS OF ENERGY doing even more damage to the courtroom

VENKMAN
Spengs take the door Ray lets try and
work them down and into the corner

Working as a team they gradually confine the Scoleri Brothers with
the

streams forcing them closer and closer to the traps Ray has set out
on

the floor
STANTZ
Watch it Im coming under you Pete

They circle around the two ghosts prodding them with the streams
while

ducking the lightning bolts shooting from their fingers Finally Ray
sees his chance and pops open the traps which emit inverted pyramids
of

light energy

STANTZ
Steady -- watch your streams -- easy now --
Venky bring him left -- Spengy pull him
down -- trapping -- trapping -- now

He stomps on a control pedal and the Scoleri Brothers are drawn into
the
traps which snap shut

MUSEUM - RESTORATION STUDIO - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
Dana is working on a valuable Flemish still-life by Ver Meer Janosz
is

at the other end of the room still working on the painting of Vigo
Venkman enters and sneaks up behind Dana

VENKMAN
(looking at the Ver Meer)
So this is what you do huh

DANA
(glad to see him)
Oh hello Peter

VENKMAN
Youre really good you know

DANA
I didnt paint it Im just cleaning it
Its an original Ver Meer Its worth about
ten million dollars

VIGO

He turns his head and watches Venkman and Dana

VENKMAN

Unaware that hes being watched Venkman squints at the still life
holding up his thumb like hes seen artists do

VENKMAN
You know you can go to Art World and get
these huge sofa-size paintings for about
forty-five bucks

He starts looking around at the other artwork in the studio

DANA
Im sure you didnt come here just to talk
about art

VENKMAN
As a matter of fact I stopped by to tell
you that I havent forgotten your problem
and that were still on the case

They are interrupted by the sudden appearance of Janosz

JANOSZ
(smiling at Venkman)
Dana arent you going to introduce me to
your friend
DANA
Oh Im sorry This is Peter Venkman
Peter Janosz Poha

Venkman warily shakes his hand trying to size him up

JANOSZ
(avoiding his gaze)
Pleasure to meet you Ive seen you on
television

VENKMAN
How are you
(looking over at the Vigo
painting)
Whats that youre working on Johnny

Janosz winces at the nickname but lets it go Venkman and Dana cross
to
the Vigo painting Janosz steps protectively in front of it

JANOSZ
Its a painting Im restoring for the new
Byzantine exhibition Its a self-portrait
of Prince Vigo the Carpathian He ruled
most of Carpathia and Moldavia in the 17th
Century

VENKMAN
(staring at the painting)
Too bad for the Moldavians

JANOSZ
(defensive)

He was a very powerful magician A genius
in many ways and quite a skilled painter

DANA
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman
I hate this painting Ive felt very
uncomfortable since they brought it up from
storage

VENKMAN
Yeah its not the kind of thing youd want
to hang in the rec room You know what it
needs
(picking up a brush)
A fluffy little white kitten in the corner
Venkman reaches toward the painting but Janosz grabs his hand

JANOSZ

(with forced good will)

We dont go around altering valuable

paintings Dr Venkman

VENKMAN

Well Id make an exception in this case if

I were you

Dana looks disapprovingly at Venkman

(to Janosz)

Tll let you get back to it

you

My pleasure

VENKMAN

JANOSZ

Venkman and Dana cross back to her workspace

VENKMAN

(confidentially)
I may be wrong but I think youve got a
little crush on this guy

Good-bye Peter

DANA

VENKMAN

(dragging his feet)
Id like to stay but I really dont have

time to hang around here

(calls out to Janosz)

Later Johnny
He exits

VIGO

Nice meeting

Tll call you

Vigo turns his head and follows Dana as she returns to her workbench

DANA

She stops vaguely aware of the movement
the

and looks up curiously at

painting As she starts to walk on Vigo looks at her again but Dana

turns suddenly and catches the movement
leaves the studio

Frightened now

she hastily
CUT TO
INT FIREHOUSE - LIVING QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY

Venkman and Winston enter and find Stantz and Spengler at work in the
lab

area

STANTZ
Oh good youre here Spengler and I have
something really amazing to show you

VENKMAN
(to Spengler)
Its not that thing you do with your
nostrils is it

Stantz goes to the refrigerator opens the freezer rummages around
among

the TV dinners and frozen pizza and pulls out a slime specimen in a
Tupperware container

STANTZ
(to Venkman)
Weve been studying the stuff that we took
from the subway tunnel

He pops the specimen jar in the microwave and lets it thaw for a
minute

VENKMAN
And now youre going to eat it

STANTZ
No Im just restoring it to its normal state

He takes the specimen out of the microwave and pours some of it into a
large Petri dish

STANTZ
Now watch this

He leans over the specimen and starts shouting at it

STANTZ
(simulating anger)

You worthless piece of slime
(as the slime starts to
twitch and glow)

You ignorant disgusting blob
SPECIMEN
It bubbles and swells changing color with each insult

STANTZ
You foul obnoxious muck

STANTZ
He continues venting his rage on the slime

STANTZ
Ive seen some real crud in my time but
youre a chemical disgrace

The specimen doubles its size and starts spilling over the rim of the
Petri dish

STANTZ AND SPENGLER
They turn to Venkman for his reaction Hes dumbfounded

VENKMAN
This is what you do with your spare time

STANTZ
(very excited)
This is an incredible breakthrough Venkman
A psychoreactive substance Whatever this
is it clearly responds to human emotional

states

VENKMAN
Mood slime We ought to bottle this stuff
and sell it

SPENGLER

Weve found it at every event site weve
been to lately

WINSTON
(poking at the slime)
You mean this stuff actually feeds on bad
vibes

STANTZ
Like a goat on garbage

STANTZ
Were running tests to see if we can get an
equally strong positive reaction
VENKMAN
What kind of tests

STANTZ
(a little embarrassed)
Well we sing to it we talk to it we say
supportive nurturing things --

VENKMAN
Youre not sleeping with this stuff are you

Spengler reacts as if he might be

STANTZ
It really responds to music
(to Spengler)
Lets calm it down

Spengler picks up a guitar and he and Stantz start singing Cumbaya
to

the slime specimen

SPECIMEN

It stops bubbling and starts to shrink

WINSTON
Does it have any favorites

STANTZ
It likes all the sappy stuff Cumbaya
‘Everything is Beautiful Its a Small
World -- but it loves Jackie Wilson

Venkman and Winston watch intently as Spengler spoons some of the
psych-reactive slime onto an old toaster

STANTZ
Watch this

Stantz turns on a CASSETTE PLAYER and Jackie Wilsons HIGHER AND
HIGHER

BLASTS from the speakers

TOASTER

It shakes spins and actually starts moving in time with the MUSIC

VENKMAN

He stares in disbelief at the dancing toaster as it shoots two pieces
of
toast into the air and catches them without missing a beat

VENKMAN
I dont care what you say This could be a
major Christmas gift item

WINSTON
Right and the first time someone gets mad
their toaster will eat their hand

VENKMAN
So well put a warning on the label

Stantz turns OFF the MUSIC and the toaster stops moving Venkman
looks
at the toaster and sticks his fingers in the slot

VENKMAN
(to the toaster)
Go ahead I dare you

Suddenly he yelps as if the toaster has actually bitten into his hand
and wont let go The others jump in to help him but Venkman laughs
and

easily withdraws his hand

VENKMAN
Just kidding

CUT TO
INT DANAS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dana brings Oscar into the bathroom and lays him on the bassinet
Shes

wearing a robe over her nightgown preparing to bathe the baby She
turns the taps on the old claw-footed bathtub checks the water
temperature then turns away and starts to undress the baby

DANA
(talking sweetly to the
baby)
Look at you I think we got more food on
your shirt than we got in your mouth

BATHTUB

The water pouring from the faucet changes to slime and settles at the
bottom of the tub Dana reaches over and turns off the water without
looking into the tub When she turns away both taps start to spin by
themselves and the tub flexes and bulges
DANA

Still unaware she routinely reaches over and squirts some bubble bath
into the tub

BATHTUB

The rim of the tub puckers up and the sides convulse as if swallowing
the
bubble bath

DANA

She picks the baby up off the bassinet and turns to place him in the
tub

She is just about to lower him into the water when the tub starts to
close up around the baby like a hugh mouth Dana screams snatches

the
baby away and runs from the room clutching Oscar to her bosom as the
bathtub convulses and vomits up buckets of slime

CUT TO
INT VENKMANS LOFT - SAME NIGHT (LATER)

The big open loft space is a chaotic clutter of mismatched furniture
old

magazines books tapes and sports equipment Venkman is asleep on
the

floor still wearing his coat scarf hat and gloves having collapsed
just short of the bedroom The DOORBELL RINGS he wakes up lumbers
to

his feet and answers it He opens the door and sees Dana standing
there

She is wearing only a nightgown under her coat and Oscar is naked
wrapped in a baby blanket

DANA
(somewhat embarrassed to
be there)
Im sorry Were you on your way out

VENKMAN
(surprised to see her)
No I just got in -- a couple hours ago

Come on in
(noting her apparel)
Are we having a pajama party

DANA
(upset)
Peter the bathtub tried to eat Oscar
Venkman looks at her for a long moment

VENKMAN
You know if anyone else told me that Id
have serious doubts But coming from you
I cant honestly say Im surprised

DANA
I must be losing my mind At the museum
today I could have sworn that terrible
painting of Vigo looked right at me

VENKMAN
Who could blame him Were you wearing this
nightgown
DANA
(distraught)

I dont know what to do anymore

VENKMAN
Ill get Ray and Egon to check out the
bathtub You better stay here

He exits to the bathroom She looks around the loft amazed at the
disorder Venkman comes back immediately with an old sweatshirt and
takes Oscar from her

VENKMAN
Now this kid has a serious nudity problem

He spreads the sweatshirt out on the sofa lays the baby on it and
starts
tying it around him like a diaper

VENKMAN
(to the baby)
This is Joe Namaths old number you know
You could get a lot of chicks with this
Just dont pee in it

DANA
Peter what about the bathtub

VENKMAN
(grabs the phone and dials)
Well take care of that
(on the phone)
Ray Pete Listen get over to Danas right
away Her bathtub pulled a fast one --
He hangs up

tried to eat the kid

DANA
It was full of this awful pink ooze

VENKMAN
(to Ray)
Sounds like another slime job No
theyre all right Theyre here now
Right Let me know
VENKMAN

Theyre going over there right now You
might as well make yourself at home Let
me show you around

(he crosses to the kitchen area)
This is the cuisine de maison --

Its an incredible mess The sink is piled high with dirty dishes and

the

counters are littered with all sorts of food trash He grabs a big

open

Hefty bag on the floor and starts throwing garbage into it

VENKMAN

(looking at the sink)
We may have to wash some of these if you get
hungry --

(he looks in the fridge)
-- but theres no food anyway so forget
about it I have all kinds of carry-out
menus if you feel like ordering

He opens a drawer full of pizza barbecue and Chinese food menus then
crosses to the bathroom

VENKMAN
Bathrooms right here -- let me just tidy
up a few things

DANA

Peter this is very nice but you dont have
to do any of this you know

He goes into the bathroom and we hear WATER RUNNING the TOILET

FLUSHING

and more items going into the Hefty bag

VENKMAN (0S)
The shower works but its a little tricky
Theyre both marked Hot It takes a little
practice but at least this one wont try
and eat you

He comes out of the bathroom with the now-loaded Hefty bag over his
shoulder

VENKMAN
Be careful on that sofa -- its a butt-biter
But the beds good and I just changed the
sheets so if you get tired feel free In

fact I think you should definitely plan on
spending the night here

DANA
Really And how would we handle the sleeping
arrangements

VENKMAN
For me its best if I sleep on my side and
you spoon up right behind me with your arms
around me If we go the other way Im
afraid your hair will be getting in my face

all night
DANA
How about you on the sofa and me in bed with
the baby
VENKMAN
Or we could do that
DANA

Thank you

(she picks up Oscar)
Poor baby I think I should put him down
now

VENKMAN

Ill put him down for you

(taking the baby)

You are way too short And your belly-button
sticks out Youre nothing but a burden to
your poor mother

Venkman carries the baby into the bedroom leaving Dana in the living
room feeling more relaxed and a lot safer

cut To

EXT MUSEUM - DAY (NEXT MORNING)
Venkman is waiting in front of the building as ECTO-2 pulls up and
Stantz Spengler and Winston get out and report on Danas apartment

VENKMAN
Did you find anything at Danas

STANTZ
Nothing Just some mood-slime residue in
and around the bathtub But we did turn up
some interesting stuff on this Vigo character
you mentioned I found the name Vigo the
Carpathian in Leon Zundingers Magicians
Martyrs and Madmen Listen to this

SPENGLER
(reads from xerox of entry)
Vigo the Carpathian born 1505 died 1610 --

VENKMAN
A hundred and five years He really hung
on didnt he

STANTZ
And he didnt die of old age either He was
poisoned stabbed shot hung stretched
disemboweled drawn and quartered

WINSTON
I guess he wasnt too popular at the end
there

SPENGLER
No not exactly a man of the people
(reads)
Also known as Vigo the Cruel Vigo the
Torturer Vigo the Despised and Vigo the
Unholy

STANTZ
This guy was a bad monkey He dabbled in
all the Black Arts and listen to this
prophecy Just before his head died his
last words were Death is but a door time
is but a window Ill be back

VENKMAN
Thats it Ill be back

subfusionary flux in this building

RUDY

Rudy gulps and starts to hunker down behind the desk as the
Ghostbusters
head upstairs

Venkman walks off leaving Stantz alone with the painting Stantz
scans
the painting with the Giga-meter until his eyes meet Vigos

VIGO
His eyes seems to burn right through to the depths of Stantzs soul
STANTZ

He stands there transfixed unable to look away as a strange and
subtle

transformation occurs within him Winston comes up behind him and
breaks

half-open and he can see Dana in the shower (tastefully blurred)
through

the transparent vinyl curtain He closes the bathroom door and looks
at

the baby asleep on the bed surrounded by pillows to prevent him
rolling

off Then he turns and bumps into Dana whos just coming out of the
bathroom wrapped in a towel She jumps back into the bathroom

She comes out again this time wearing a robe

VENKMAN

might want to come along

VENKMAN
Darn it I wish Id known you were going
Im stuck with these damn dinner reservations

SPENGLER
You know animals and lower life forms often
anticipate major disasters Given the new

magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous
breeding surge in the cockroach population
VENKMAN

Roach breeding Sounds better and better

(calls out)
Dana The boys are going down under the
sewers tonight to look for slime Egon
thinks there might even be some kind of big
roach-breeding surge Should we forget about
dinner and go with them instead

Dana steps into the living room looking very beautiful

Wow
Dana looks curiously at their outfits
DANA
Hi
They nod and wave back

guided by a very old map of the underground city

STANTZ
This is it Van Horne Station Right where
the old transit map said it would be

They cross to the edge of the platform and look into the river of
slime

STANTZ

Lets get a sounding on the depth of that
flow

Stantz has a long coiled graduated cord with a plumb bob on the end
of

it attached to his utility belt

STANTZ
Stand back

He takes the cord in his hand swings the plumb bob over his head and
casts it out into the middle of the flow The plumb bob sinks and
Spengler reads the depth

SPENGLER
Six feet -- seven -- eight --

STANTZ
Thats it Its on the bottom

SPENGLER
Nine feet -- ten --

WINSTON
Is the line sinking

SPENGLER

No the slime is rising

Stantz looks down and notices the slime rising over the edge of the
platform and around his boots

STANTZ
(alarmed)
Lets get out of here boys

He starts to pull out the plumb line but it seems to be stuck

Spengler tries to help but whatever is pulling on the cord is
stronger

than all three of them As their unseen adversary pulls them closer
and

closer to the edge Stantz works desperately to unhook the cord from
his

belt but finally just unhooks the whole belt Spengler lets go in
time

but Winston doesnt He is jerked off his feet and into the slime
flow

Stantz and Spengler look at each other summon their courage and jump
in

after him

DANA
Oh Peter I didnt dump you I just had
to protect myself You really werent very
good for me you know

VENKMAN

DANA
Why do you say things like that Youre so
much better than you know

VENKMAN
Thank you If I had that kind of support
on a daily basis I could definitely shape
up by the turn of the century

DANA
(already feeling the
effects of the champagne)
So why dont you give me a jingle in the
year 2000

VENKMAN
Let me jingle you right now
He leans over to kiss her

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT (SAME TIME)

JANINE
(looking around)
I cant believe a person could actually live

LOUIS
(to the baby)
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in
a small mining operation and then one day a
beautiful princess came to live with them

JANINE
Its really not a bad place It just needs
a womans touch

LOUIS

(continuing)
So they bartered room and board in exchange
for housekeeping services which was a good
deal for all of them because then they didnt
have to withhold tax and social security
which Im not saying is right but its just
a story so I guess its all right I can
finish this later if youre tired

Louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down

JANINE
Youre really good with children Louis I
can tell
(as he returns)
Why dont you come here and sit with me
LOUIS

collecting under the city

get through this stuff

in this city that theres no way back
Sure its crowded its dirty its noisy
And there are too many people whod just as
soon step on your face as look at you But
thereve got to be a few sparks of sweet
humanity left in this burned-out burg We

Vigo You are like the buzzing of flies to
him

knees down He spits and rages at the Ghostbusters trying to unleash
his magic powers

neutralized by the good will of the people

little monkey

painting

INT MUSEUM - NEW PAINTING - NIGHT
