ACT ONE
FADE IN

COIT TOWER shoots into the night sky through the dense FOG
that seems to be illuminated from within We fly past as we
descend into the mist

Shapes are barely perceptible - until suddenly CHLOE drops
into frame She takes a quick look around and starts to run

We’re on the DOCKS Chloe walks past us - cautious but not
afraid Determined She slowly passes a metal shipping
container and runs her hand along it and we hear the
SCREECH of metal against metal

REVEAL long CLAW MARKS carved into the steel as she turns the
corner She clearly wants them to know that she’s here

Chloe is now crouched on the roof of a container listening
when suddenly

BANG
A shot rings out Where
BANG
And she takes off sprinting toward the sound - panic in her
eyes She races down a tunnel of containers turns the
corner and stops dead There’s a MAN lying on the ground
shot After a beat
CHLOE
Alek

Alek Ohmigod no

ALEK opens his eyes as Chloe takes him in her arms

ALEK
I wanted to protect you

CHLOE
Who did this

But before he can answer--

SMASH CUT TO

INT HOSPITALCORRIDOR - NIGHT

BAM A gurney is slammed through the swinging doors with a
swarm of NURSES and EMTs hustling along at its side A DOCTOR
hurriedly joins in the procession

CHYRON UP “Three Days Earlier”

EMT
BP’s seventy over forty and
falling Pulse is almost non-
existent

REVEAL that the man on the gurney is Brian - pale lifeless
LIPS slightly BLUE BLOOD covers his hands and shirt

DOCTOR
What happened

EMT
No idea Some kids said they found
him like this

DOCTOR
Did you locate the entry wound
Looks like he’s lost a lot of
blood

EMT
No wounds The blood’s not his

And they disappear through another set of doors

AMY is behind the wheel with PAUL in the backseat Chloe -

her blouse covered in blood - is staring at the hospital She
wipes away a few tears Amy and Paul exchange a look
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

AMY
(To Chloe sincere)
I’m sure Brian’s going to be okay

CHLOE
Really ‘Cause the last time I
kissed someone I ended up going to
his funeral

AMY
But you said that he kissed you

CHLOE
Ancient curses - not sure if they
really make those kind of
distinctions

PAUL
I still can’t believe you let him
do it

CHLOE
Well I was slightly preoccupied
coming back to life I guess the
three bullets to the heart kinda
put me off my game

PAUL
Sorry
(beat)
Hey maybe it doesn’t count if you
kiss him while youre half-dead

CHLOE
(mocking)
Fingers crossed

AMY
How about we just don’t talk about
it okay

After a beat

PAUL
(to Chloe)
So was it any different dying for a
second time

AMY
Paul

PAUL
How should I know Maybe it gets
easier

INT THEATRELOBBY - FLASHBACK (EPISODE 110)

Chloe is stopped at the bottom of the grand staircase as
SIMONE raises her gun and fires three SHOTS in SLOW-MOTION
Chloe is struck in the chest and falls back onto the stairs
blood already streaming from the wounds

INTEXT AMYS CAR - BACK TO SCENE
Chloe shakes herself from the memory

CHLOE
Dying definitely still sucks

PAUL
I gotta say as crazed assassins
go she was pretty hot
(off their reaction)
What I saw her as she drove off

AMY
Paul why don’t you go see what’s
going on

PAUL
We can’t ignore this and pretend it
didn’t happen Somebody set a
pretty elaborate trap tonight for
Chloe - so what makes you think
they’re going to stop now

CHLOE
(almost to herself)
They’re never going to stop

PAUL
Exactly

Now Amy gives him a very pointed look and opens the door
PAUL (CONTD)
Fine But we’re still gonna talk

about it when I get back

He crawls out of the backseat and heads into the hospital
After a beat
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

Amy starts

AMY
(to Chloe)
I’1l break up with him if you want
me to
CHLOE

Youre a good friend But it’s okay

- especially since he’s right
(beat)

I can’t just sit out here Give me

your jacket

AMY
Chloe No What if somebody sees
you You’re covered in blood

CHLOE
Which is why you’re giving me your
jacket

to take off her jacket

AMY
But shouldn’t we call someone
There are people trying to kill you
- which I guess isn’t all that
unusual - but Alek or Valentina
need to know

CHLOE
I don’t think Alek’1l care

AMY
How can you say that

CHLOE
‘Cause he kinda overheard me tell
my mom that I might be in love with
Brian

AMY
(excited)
Ohmigod Chloe

CHLOE
Not the point of the story

AMY
Sorry But you still need to tell
Alek what happened He’s your
protector Do you even know where
he is
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 6

CHLOE
No idea But you know Alek I’m
sure he’s off sulking somewhere

EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

CRASH Alek smashes into a wall of trash cans with a loud
clatter But he immediately LEAPS after the DARK FIGURE
trying to get away

Alek tackles him but the FIGURE spins around - also with
super-human speed and agility It’s ZANE - and he almost
slashes Alek with the KNIFE that he’s holding

lek is clearly the aggressor - fueled by hatred A SERIES of
wift BLOWS as the brothers fight to the death Zane’s knife
oes flying Alek ducks a SWOOSH of Zane’s CLAWS

Quy

Alek spins and kicks Zane in the chest Zane crashes to the
ground - before he can even react Alek is on him arms
pinned Zane’s own knife to his throat Both men are out of
breath

ZANE
I’m impressed Now what

ALEK
Now - I kill you

ZANE
Really Before you even know the
truth

ALEK

I know what I need to know

ZANE
You know that everything
Valentina’s ever told you about
your past is a lie
(beat)
Alek you’re not who you think you
are

This hits Alek and his conviction falters for just a moment -
and in a flash Zane FLIPS him off SPRINGS to his feet

Alek turns for him but a kick to the chest sends him flying
He picks himself up and watches as Zane disappears over the
wall He turns but comes face to face with

ALEK
JASMINE
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

JASMINE bloodied and beaten is standing in front of him

He goes to hug her but she stops him with a hand to his
chest

JASMINE
Why didn’t you kill him

Off Alek’s reaction

RAISED VOICES
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 8

On the other side of the emergency room Brian’s father
WHITLEY REZZA has cornered a doctor We ZOOM IN on CHLOE’S
EAR as she listens

WHITLEY
No I will not calm down My son is
in some kind of coma and you can’t
even tell me what’s wrong with him

DOCTOR
I’m sorry I wish I knew We’re
doing everything we can think of

WHITLEY
Then think harder I want answers
and I want them now

Chloe steps back behind a column to stay hidden but catches
a glimpse of Amy and Paul at the nurses station She nods for
them to go But she can see the doctor pointing Whitley in
their direction It’s too late

WHITLEY (CONT’D)
You two

Amy and Paul stop

WHITLEY (CONTD)
They said you’re the ones who found
my son
(then sincere)
Thank you

PAUL
(nervous )
Yeah No problem We just wanted to
make sure he was okay

WHITLEY
He’s not
(beat)
So you just found him there alone
bloody and unconscious - in the
middle of an abandoned theatre

PAUL
Yeah

WHITLEY
Then I have to ask - what were you
doing there

Paul looks to Amy She can see Chloe in the background
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

PAUL
Um well it’s uh

AMY
What do you think we were doing
there He’s got a mother who hates
the sight of me and I’ve got a
backseat the size of a small
canteloupe

PAUL
Yes That That’s what we were
doing there Or hoping to do there
We actually hadn’t done anything
yet before we you know--

AMY
Please stop talking

WHITLEY
My son is dying I’m glad you’re
taking this so seriously

Whitley turns away and Paul starts to pull Amy along but she
just can’t help herself

AMY
I really am sorry

And Whitley stops detecting something in her tone

PAUL
We should go

Paul pulls Amy away Whitley watches them - but then he
thinks he catches a glimpse of Chloe in a reflection of one
of the windows He spins around - but she’s gone

Chloe SIGHS and turns to face her mother

MEREDITH (CONTD)

(not happy)
Sit

CHLOE
Is there any possible way we could
have this conversation tomorrow
Never is also an option

MEREDITH
Call Text Email Or maybe just a
good old-fashioned note I have
been sitting here for the last two
hours quietly freaking out--

CHLOE
Mom--—

MEREDITH
Oh no There will be no “mom” I
want some answers When I talked to
you before I went out on my date--

CHLOE

You said it was a business meeting
MEREDITH

Do not change the subject -- You

said you were staying in

CHLOE
Amy called and

MEREDITH

Chloe - please don’t insult me I
thought we weren’t doing this
anymore I thought we weren’t lying
to each other

(no response)
Yes or no Did you sneak out to see
Brian

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

CHLOE
No I did not go out to see Brian

MEREDITH
Then what is going on with you

CHLOE
Nothing I’m fine

MEREDITH
Do you even hear yourself We would
not be having this conversation if
you were fine

CHLOE
You’re right That was a lie
Everything is not fine Nothing in
my life is fine - and I don’t know
if it ever will be - but there is
truly nothing that you can do to
fix it

MEREDITH
Chloe--

CHLOE
No I’m sorry But this is not an I-
was-sixteen-once-too-you-know
moment My life My issues My
problems to solve The only thing
that you could possibly do right
now that might help is is to
just tell me that you love me

After a long beat

MEREDITH
I love you Always and forever

CHLOE
(through tears)
See Better already

Chloe goes to kiss her mom but Meredith pulls her in and hugs
her tight Chloe hugs her back

MEREDITH
I’m scared

CHLOE
Me too

Meredith finally lets go Chloe wipes a tear off her mother’s
cheek and then heads upstairs Meredith looks after her
worried and pained - unsure what to do

INT CHLOE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Chloe enters without turning on the light She starts to take
off her jacket but there’s the faintest CREAK behind her

INSTANTLY Chloe spins around - FLIP SLAM THUD And she has
her assailant pressed up against the wall forearm to his
throat CLAWS at the ready

It’s Alek

CHLOE
Alek

ALEK
Chloe I--

But suddenly she hugs him burying her head in his shoulder
He’s at a loss at first and then starts to wrap his arms
around her Just as suddenly she pushes him away

CHLOE
Where have you been Protector Do
you have any idea what happened to
me tonight

ALEK
(re her shirt)
You’re hurt

CHLOE
Let’s just call that an
understatement
(then sensing)
What’s wrong

ALEK
Valentina’s dead

Off Chloe’s reaction

CELLPHONE buzz

Simone in the backseat answers

SIMONE
Perfect timing I was just about to
call you with a report

INTERCUT WITH

INT HOSPITALBRIAN’S ROOM - SAME TIME
Whitley is on his cell Brian in the bed behind him

WHITLEY
Maybe you can start by explaining
why the girl is still alive and my
son is on life-support

SIMONE
We never intended to kill the girl
tonight

WHITLEY
(exploding)
I don’t care about the goddamn
girl I want to know how you let
Brian get involved in this

SIMONE
I didn’t know my job description
included baby-sitter

WHITLEY
You work for me Never forget that

After a beat

SIMONE
You can’t really be so naive to
think that the Mai wouldn’t target
those closest to you I believe I’m
the one who warned you to send him
back to college

WHITLEY
I was doing this so he’d finally be
safe

SIMONE

And you’re sure the Mai are
responsible

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

Whitley picks up a report sitting on the table

WHITLEY
I’m sure They tested the blood on
his hands and shirt it’s not
human

EXT SIMONE’S CARCOUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

The car turns off the road onto a gravel drive Huge steel
gates start to swing open

INT SECRET CHAMBER - SHORT TIME LATER

CLOSE ON a simple GOLDEN CHALICE - the etchings on it are
Egyptian the distinct feline figure of Bastet is chief among
them REVEAL that OLIVIA REZZA is sitting at the end of the
long otherwise empty table - the chalice in the middle The
dark room is lit by candlelight

There is the sound of a heavy door closing and Simone steps
up behind Olivia’s chair

OLIVIA
Youre late You’ve kept our guests
waiting

REVEAL that the other DOZEN or so chairs are also occupied
The shadows obscure their faces

SIMONE

It was unavoidable
OLIVIA

Is she dead
SIMONE

She was for a moment or two
OLIVIA

(pleased)

Then she really is the Uniter
There is faint murmuring from the rest of the assembled

OLIVIA (CONTD)
How many lives did she lose

SIMONE
Tonight Just the one
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 15

OLIVIA

Good That should leave us with at
least six to use as we will More
than enough

(beat to group)
Our quest is coming to its end
Once we have the girl - every last
Mai will be dead and we won’t even
have to leave this room

ANGLE BACK on the CHALICE

SIMONE
There was however a slight
complication

That’s not what Olivia wants to hear

EXT CHLOE’S HOUSEROOF - NIGHT

Chloe is standing on the edge of the roof looking out at the
city in the distance The horizon is just starting to get
light Alek sits behind her

ALEK
I think the first thing I ever told
you was that Mai and humans don’t
mix

CHLOE
I know I remember

ALEK
And it wasn’t just for selfish
reasons

CHLOE

I get it It’s my fault Conscious
or unconscious This never would
have happened if I’d just told him
to stay away

ALEK
You really don’t expect me to offer
you a shoulder to cry on do you
(beat a little softer)
But something tells me he’d have
kept coming around no matter what
you told him

Chloe looks to Alek After a beat she turns away
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

CHLOE
Do you know why he did it Why Zane
killed Valentina

ALEK
(quickly)
How should I know

CHLOE
I just -- it makes it harder to
know who to trust

ALEK
Then trust no one
CHLOE
You’re not the first person to say

that to me
They’re both quiet for a moment

ALEK
This isn’t over It’s just
beginning It was a well-planned
attack They targeted you and
everyone around you They’re not
going to stop--

CHLOE
--until I’m dead

ALEK

No Until we all are This isn’t
just about you anymore

(beat)
The Order has declared war From
this moment on - there are only two
outcomes It’s either us or it’s
them

CHLOE
Then let’s make sure it’s us

Chloe and Alex share a look as we

In a secluded grove of redwoods everyone has gathered for
Valentina’s funeral Chloe is off to the side with Amy and
Paul Several DOZEN MAI are there paying their respects
Jasmine is standing at the end of the open GRAVE Alek ina
black suit is behind her

JASMINE
And we say good-bye to a mother
a warrior a friend And I vow on
my life that your sacrifices will
not be forgotten - and that the
wrongs done upon you will be
avenged

(then in ancient Mai)

Ana behibak tamul

After a beat she tosses the flower she’s holding into the
grave and nods at two men who start shoveling dirt into the
hole Alek immediately turns away and brushes past Chloe

CHLOE
Alek

But he doesn’t stop Chloe shares a look with Amy

DISSOLVE TO

REDWOOD FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

Alek is alone looking down at a small creek - the gravesite
is in the background Amy comes up next to him

AMY
Hey
(no response)
I just wanted to say how sorry I
am Even though I never really had
a mom--

ALEK
Valentina wasn’t my mother
(beat)
She was my savior
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

AMY
(trying a different tack)
You know that Chloe--

ALEK
Is the Uniter and I am sworn to
protect her I get it You don’t
have to worry

AMY
I know you’re mourning - and you’re
in pain - but can you please try
not to take it out on Chloe It’s
not her fault

ALEK
Why don’t you ask Brian if he
agrees with you
(walking away)
Oh can’t do that now can you

AMY
Hey - I once warned you that if
anything happened to Chloe you’d
have to answer to me - well things
are happening to Chloe so I expect
you to do something Do you
honestly think that for even a
second she wants any of this That
she wouldn’t walk away if she
thought it would make a difference
You’re supposed to be more than her
protector - you’re her friend
Don’t make her feel more alone than
she already is

ALEK
(softening)
I’m sorry You’re right She
deserves better
(then)
And thank you for coming It means
a lot

AMY
Of course

They share a smile and she gives him a quick up and down

ALEK
What
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

AMY
I don’t know I’ve just never seen
you in a suit before

ALEK
Wow - even I wouldn’t hit on
someone at funeral

AMY
What I wasn’t hitting--

But she’s cut off by the sound of an altercation between Paul
and a tough-looking Mai GARRETH

GARRETH
Hey - why don’t you watch where
youre going--
(shoving him)
--human

PAUL
I wasn’t going anywhere Why don’t
you watch where you’re going

And Chloe is quickly between them

CHLOE
It’s a forest There’s plenty of
room for everyone to watch where
everyone is going

GARRETH
(re Amy and Paul)
They shouldn’t be here It’s a
sacrilege

CHLOE
They’re my friends

GARRETH
Humans will never be our friends
That was always Valentina’s
problem She was too weak to--

SLAM IN HYPER-SPEED Garreth is thrown onto the ground
Before he can even react Jasmine has her boot on his throat

JASMINE
My mother’s only problem was that
she had to spend time dealing with
ungrateful back-stabbing lowlifes
Youd be nothing without her

But Garreth doesn’t seem too intimidated

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 20

GARRETH
I didn’t realize you’d been elected
pride leader

JASMINE
And I didn’t realize this was a
democracy

She pushes down on his throat for emphasis before abruptly
walking away the crowd parting as she goes Garreth is left
on the ground gasping for breath

EXT REDWOOD FORESTCLEARING - SHORT TIME LATER

Jasmine is in tears Chloe has her arm around her Alek Paul
and Amy look on

JASMINE
I can’t do it I promised her - but
I just can’t

CHLOE
It’s going to be okay
JASMINE
I’m not like her I’m not a leader
(beat)
I shouldn’t even be here I should
be dead
CHLOE
Don’t say that
JASMINE
But it’s true She gave her life

for mine

Valentina’s lips start to tremble
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 21

VALENTINA
(barely audible)
Jasmine
Valentina slides her hand across the floor toward Jasmine
Jasmine reaches out and lays hers on top Valentina squeezes
it but then puts her hand on Jasmine’s heart
JASMINE (VO)
It took me a second to realize what
she was doing
Jasmine weak tries to pull her mother’s hand away

JASMINE
No

VALENTINA
I love you mija

And suddenly Valentina’s PALM begins to GLOW

JASMINE
No Mom Don’t Mom

But there’s a FLASH and the GLOW shoots through Jasmine’s
body and Valentina’s hand instantly goes back to normal as
it falls away from Jasmine’s body onto the floor

Valentina falls back as her eyes roll up She’s dead

JASMINE (CONT’D)
Mom

Jasmine now with her mother’s life force coursing through
her crawls over and cradles her in her arms

AMY
I’m sorry I don’t understand She
literally gave you her life

ALEK

It’s a power - if that’s what you
want to call it - that we all have
Some stronger than others We can
channel our energy to save a
life or to take one

(beat)
Of course it kills you so you
don’t see Mai using it too often

JASMINE
Why did she do it

CHLOE
Because she loved you She didn’t
have a choice It’s what any mother
would do

Jasmine looks up as her uncertain and obviously afraid

The bed is unmade The room is nowhere near its usual tidy
self

MEREDITH
(calling out to bathroom)
Chloe are you in there

No response Meredith looks around She hesitates over the

computer but moves on Then she notices the wastebasket full

of crumpled paper She takes one sheet out and unfolds it -
it’s blank She starts pulling out more - finally she gets
to what the paper is hiding

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 23

Chloe’s BLOODY BLOUSE Meredith slowly picks it up What’s
going on She sits down on the bed and stares at it for a
beat trying to wrap her mind around the possibilities

Then abruptly she gets up tossing the blouse on the floor
and hurries out of the room

over him

CHLOE
Hey It’s me Not really sure if
you can hear me - or even if youd
want to if you could - but you have
to know I never meant for this to
happen

She brushes a curl off of his forehead

ANGLE ON the NURSING STATION as Whitley walks past He stops
when he sees Chloe through the glass in Brian’s room

ANGLE ON Chloe She looks at her hands for a moment - then
pulls the sheet back a little exposing Brian’s chest

ANGLE ON Whitley as he moves through the ICU passing a
triage cart He picks up a SCALPEL as he heads towards
Brian’s room

ANGLE ON Chloe as she places a hand on Brian’s heart

CHLOE (CONT’D)
Kind of the least I can do right

As she’s about to press down

WHITLEY (0S)
What the hell are you doing
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

Chloe GASPS and spins around Whitley is right there

WHITLEY (CONT’D)
Get away from him

CHLOE
(flustered)
I’m sorry I didn’t know you were
there I just came to visit I’m
Chloe

WHITLEY
I know who you are What I don’t
know is why you’re here

CHLOE
Brian and I are friends

WHITLEY
Why the hesitation

CHLOE
I don’t know Sometimes it felt
like maybe we were more

WHITLEY

And yet he never mentioned you
CHLOE

Well we all have our secrets

(getting more nervous)
You’re Brian’s dad right We
actually almost met once or twice

Whitley is fighting to stay in control We see the scalpel
behind his back as he passes by Chloe Finally

WHITLEY
I don’t think you should be here

CHLOE
I just thought I just wanted to
help

WHITLEY
Don’t you think you’ve done enough
already

Whitley just stares at her Chloe really isn’t sure if he
knows who she is or what happened But how could he

CHLOE
It was nice to finally meet you

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 25

And with a quick look back at Brian Chloe leaves Whitley
watches her go as he finally sets the scalpel down

Suddenly

BRIAN
Chloe

Brian startles back to life every machine going off Whitley
rushes to his side as Brian looks around obviously unsure of
where he is or what’s happened

WHITLEY

alright

Whitley glances back out the window into the ICU but Chloe is
nowhere to be seen

INT CHLOE’S HOUSEMEREDITH’S ROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

Meredith is sitting on the bed reading We come around to
discover that she has the contents of the BOX spread out in
front of her There’s a birth certificate and adoption papers
and other documents all in Ukrainian

But Meredith is reading a crumpled and faded newspaper
clipping She folds it back over and the headline reads -
Miracle Child Discovered in Rubble And below it is a very
grainy black and white photograph of a GIRL no more than
one or two standing in what appears to be the remains of a
burnt out farmhouse

Chloe and Brian are where we left them Brian looks like he
wants to say something but stops himself and takes off down
the stairs

CHLOE
Brian

He doesn’t slow down as Chloe follows after

CHLOE (CONT’D)
I never meant to hurt you Please
stop Talk to me You have to let
me explain

BRIAN
(whirling around)
Explain what How every moment of
our relationship has been a huge
lie

CHLOE
I haven’t lied to you I wanted to
tell you - I just couldn’t

BRIAN
I don’t know what sick twisted
plan you’ve got going on - but my
dad was finally right about
something

CHLOE
(grabbing his arm)
Your dad What does he have to do

with this
BRIAN
Don’t touch me
(beat)

I didn’t believe him when he told

me Insane right I called hima

lunatic But I can look into your

eyes right now and know every word
he said to me is true

CHLOE
Is that really all you see when you
look into my eyes

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

He turns away

BRIAN
And I spent all these years
thinking my father was somehow
responsible - but he was just
trying to protect me

CHLOE
I tried to stay away I did I told
you I told you that we could
never be together

BRIAN
You think that’s what this is
about That it’s about you and me
After what you’ve done to my
family

CHLOE
Your family Brian I really don’t
know what you’re talking about I
just met your dad--

BRIAN
(cutting her off)
What do you call yourselves again

CHLOE
Mai

BRIAN
So you’re going to stand here and
pretend that you don’t know that
the Mai killed my mother

CHLOE
What That’s not true You said--

BRIAN
They slaughtered her When my
father found her - she was covered
in claw marks
(beat)
I truly loved you Chloe

He finally gets into his car and drives away down the street
leaving Chloe looking after him completely alone - no idea
how to process what she’s just heard

PULL BACK to an UNKNOWN POV from a nearby rooftop REVEAL
that Zane is watching her He’s still beat-up and bloodied
from his encounter with Alek - and he looks even more
unhinged than usual

Chloe glances back but doesn’t see him He watches Chloe zip
up her jacket and take off down the street

You can’t just abandon me

SIMONE
Of course if you need a letter of
reference--

ZANE
The Mai will rip me to shreds if
they ever find me--

Then I suggest you find a good
place to hide

ZANE
Wait You promised--

But the line goes dead Zane closes his phone REVEAL that he

is now standing directly in front of Chloe’s

Simone puts her phone away Olivia is sitting next to her

Olivia smiles

I never doubted that he’d pull
through His blood is pure

SIMONE
But your son has apparently told
him everything

OLIVIA
Everything
SIMONE
Enough
OLIVIA
Well at least it saves me the
trouble
SIMONE

But it does mean that we won’t be
able to use Brian to control the
girl anymore

OLIVIA
I’m afraid we’re well past that

Oh Whitley Always such a problem
child What’s a mother to do

SIMONE’S CAR - MOVING - GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

PULL BACK from the speeding car REVEALING that it is
crossing the Golden Gate Bridge as it heads into the city

INT COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

Chloe is mid-conversation with Alek Paul Amy and Jasmine
They’re all huddled around a table in the back of this
otherwise quiet coffee house

JASMINE
Chloe come on if Brian’s dad told
Brian then he has to be part of
the Order

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

AMY
Or maybe he’s just really well
informed

PAUL

Hey I’ve looked everywhere on the
internet and can’t find anything
about The Order

ALEK
Well then as secret societies go -
they’re doing a pretty good job

CHLOE
(to Jasmine)
Did your mom ever say anything
about Whitley Rezza If he really
was involved she had to have
known

JASMINE
She never mentioned him to me but
that doesn’t mean anything

ALEK
(pointed)
She also knew how to keep a secret

Jasmine shoots him a quizzical look

PAUL
But if Whitley Rezza is the big
evil - doesn’t that mean that Brian
was also part of the Order - and
that he’s you know been spying on
you and us this whole time

CHLOE
No That isn’t what it means

ALEK
Kind of a coincidence don’t you
think

AMY

We don’t even know how much his
father is involved - maybe somebody
told him Maybe they’re just
innocent pawns in a bigger plan
There are hundreds of explanations
(off their looks)
Hey - I just gave you two You can
figure out some more on your own
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN

CHLOE
(grateful)
Thank you But I just know that
Brian wasn’t involved

JASMINE
Your judgement might be a little
clouded

ALEK
You think

Suddenly Paul jumps up

He shows them his phone On it is a picture of Whitley in a
tuxedo standing with Simone in a white evening gown at an art

gallery

PAUL
(re his phone)
Yes

AMY
Paul - seriously - put the video
game away

PAUL
No I was searching for images of
Brian’s dad - and I found this

(EPISODE 106)

CHLOE
Ohmigod I was there that night

PAUL
But that’s her right That’s the
hot assassin That’s who shot you
and I saw driving away Doesn’t

this pretty much prove that Brian’s

dad is the one responsible for
everything that’s happening

Amy hits him

PAUL (CONTD)
What

AMY
That isn’t exactly what we were
trying to prove

ALEK
As if I actually needed another
reason to hate that guy

- MCGEE

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

CHLOE
It still doesn’t mean that Brian--

JASMINE
Chloe

AMY
(excited)
But he kissed her He wouldn’t have
done that if he knew

Nobody has an answer for that

PAUL
I still don’t understand why he’s
even alive I mean that last guy
was out cold in like--

Amy hits him again

AMY
Really

JASMINE
Paul’s right I don’t know why he’s
alive either

(to Chloe)
Sorry
ALEK
Unless

(to Chloe holding his

hand over his heart)
You didn’t try to “heal” him did
you

CHLOE
No I--
(beat)
I never got the chance

Jasmine suddenly looks up at Alek

JASMINE
(remembering ancient Mai)
Alhe hanak beni cando hari
basque

ALEK
Sorry - you’re going to have to
give me a little more Preferably
in English

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 35

JASMINE

(to Chloe)
There’s a prophecy about the
curse

(beat)
“When the Uniter loves the
offspring of her enemy the curse
will be broken”

ALEK
What does that have to do with
anything

PAUL
I get it Whitley is her enemy and
Brian is his offspring

AMY
Maybe the curse was broken

ALEK
Quick - somebody find me a human to
kiss and we’1ll find out

CHLOE
Okay - slow down First twenty-
four hours in a coma doesn’t really
sound like it’s been broken to me--

JASMINE
But something happened He should
be dead

CHLOE

And second - I don’t know how I
feel about Brian And I never told
him that--

AMY
Chloe--

CHLOE
I didn’t I swear

AMY
(looking off)
No Turn around

Chloe turns to see her mom standing just inside the door

CHLOE

You answered the door and didn’t
come back and you didn’t take your
phone with you so I couldn’t
really call

CHLOE
Sorry

She hands Chloe her phone

CHLOE (CONTD)
Thanks

After a few beats it’s clear that Meredith isn’t going away

EXT SAN FRANCISCO BAYWARMING HUT - DAY

Chloe and Meredith are sitting at a picnic table on the
windswept hill with its spectacular view of the Golden Gate
Bridge Meredith sets the box in front of Chloe

CHLOE
What’s this

MEREDITH

I decided that I can’t keep
demanding that you tell me the
truth - if I’m the one who’s lying

(beat)
I don’t know what’s going on with
you Chloe Or what you’re going
through But maybe something in
here will help

Chloe opens the box to reveal the documents She takes out
her birth certificate

CHLOE
Is this me Is this all mine

MEREDITH
Yeah

CHLOE
But you said--

MEREDITH
I know what I said I promised your
father
(beat)
We didn’t just adopt you - we were
protecting you

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

MEREDITH (CONTD)
From who or what - your father said
it would be safer for both of us if
I didn’t know

CHLOE
Safer

MEREDITH
He just said that there were people
in the world who wanted you dead I
couldn’t imagine who would want to
kill a child but-- I swore to him
I’m sorry

Chloe takes her hand It’s okay Chloe picks up the article
Meredith was reading earlier with the headline “Miracle
Child Discovered in Rubble”

CHLOE
What’s this

MEREDITH
You

As Chloe looks up at her for an explanation we

DISSOLVE TO

EXT UKRAINIAN VILLAGE - FLASHBACK - DAWN

A small village is completely destroyed All the homes have
been burned and smoke is still clouding the air

We see a man from the waist down leading a few OTHERS as
they walk through the devastation They have to step over
several DEAD BODIES

MEREDITH (VO)

Your father was investigating
reports of ethnic cleansing and
genocide in Eastern Europe
Several remote villages had been
completely destroyed - no one was
sure who was responsible

The man steps over a charred victim The burned hand appears
to have CLAWS

MEREDITH (VO)

They got to one village just after
the massacre had happened They
searched everywhere hoping to find
some survivors - there weren’t any

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 38

The man stops and slowly turns around

MEREDITH (VO)

But then in the middle of
everything they found a little
girl with big eyes - and not a
scratch on her

a little curly-haired girl is standing in the middle of a
burned-out home arms stretched out towards him

DISSOLVE TO

EXT SAN FRANCISCO BAYWARMING HUT - BACK TO SCENE

He had no idea how you could have
survived but there you were and

here you are now
Chloe just looks back down at her one-year-old self

MEREDITH (CONTD)
And that is all I know

(deep breath relieved)
It’s funny - you never realize how
heavy secrets are until you stop
carrying them

CHLOE
Mom--—

MEREDITH
No Let this settle You can tell
me what you want to tell me when
youre ready
(beat)
I just hopes this helps

CHLOE
It does
(re the box)
Can I--
MEREDITH

It’s all yours
Chloe gets up

MEREDITH (CONT’D)

I’1l meet you back at the house I
think both of us could probably use
a few moments alone

Chloe kisses her and starts to walk across the hill towards
home Meredith watches her go for a beat then turns back to
the wind and the view and her thoughts

the slightest movement in the shadows behind her

why you--

SLAM CHLOE is violently thrown up against the wall Before
she can even react - she has a hand on her THROAT and a

ZANE
Don’t worry I’m not going to kill
you I’m going to sell you to the
highest bidder But sadly they are
going to kill you

Just as Zane is about to puncture the skin - SWOOSH - Chloe
grabs the hand that’s holding the needle her other hand on
his neck CRASH - Zane slams up against the wall

But he’s back on her in a flash Chloe is kicked into the
mirror which SHATTERS He lunges but she deflects SLAM

Chloe gets a claw to his face but he barely seems to notice
as the blood starts to seep

Zane pulls a blade out of a sheath There’s nowhere to run or
hide in this small space Chloe flips over the top of him

Zane DIVES at her - the knife just missing by inches Chloe
whips around and he BANGS into the desk CRASH

As Chloe turns he YANKS the rug and she ends up on her back
Before she can move - he’s on her She pushes against his
chest but he relentlessly brings the blade closer to her
Then suddenly -

CHLOE’S CAT EYES FLARE - an intense look comes over her face
as she stares with fury into his eyes Chloe’s PALMS begin to
GLOW (just as Valentina’s did when she saved Jasmine)

And Zane gasps - struggles for breath as if the very life
were being choked out of him He drops the blade

For a brief moment Chloe is overwhelmed by the power
coursing through her Another beat though and she realizes
she’s killing him She jerks her hands away from his chest -
the glow instantly disappearing

Chloe pushes Zane away as he catches his breath Her back to
him she struggles to regain her self-control Zane’s face
contorts into a mask of rage and he grabs the knife RAISING
it high -

Suddenly a HAND catches his wrist and twists him around
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 41

It’s Jasmine Before he can react she PLUNGES a KNIFE into
his gut He starts to stumble back - mortally wounded But
Jasmine catches him by the hair and holds him up

JASMINE
Look at me I want this face to be
the last thing you see before you
die And just know - if there
really is an afterlife - you’re
gonna see it again

Jasmine pulls the knife out Zane looks like he’s going to
say something but only manages a half-smile before blood
trickles out of the corners and his eyes roll up He’s dead

We hold on Jasmine looking at her mother’s killer in the
middle of Chloe’s completely destroyed room Chloe crawls
back up against a wall to catch her breath

There’s one of those sentences you
think you’re never going to hear
But are oh-so-weirdly grateful when
you do

Chloe sets the tea down in front of Jasmine

JASMINE
Thanks

CHLOE
It was weird I wasn’t in control
of what was happening It felt like
I was literally pulling the life
out of him

you might have lost one of yours

taking

I still don’t understand - Zane’s
Mai Why would he do this

JASMINE
I’m guessing it was personal

He said something to Alek when they
were fighting before I couldn’t
hear what it was

CHLOE
Did you ask Alek

Jasmine gives her a look

CHLOE (CONT’D)
Do you at least know where he is

JASMINE
He went to keep an eye on Whitley

Now it’s Chloe’s turn to give her a look

JASMINE

Amazing Somehow you can appear as
if the world isn’t blowing up
around you

SIMONE
Because it’s not I had a lovely
day But you really shouldn’t be in
this business

WHITLEY
I don’t intend to be for much
longer

SIMONE

Valentina - the leader of the local
Mai pride - is dead Reports are
that the rest are scattering as
predicted

WHITLEY
I don’t care about the rest I want
the girl dead and I want her dead
now

SIMONE
Are you sure you shouldn’t leave
this to others who are more
equipped

Simone moves to the bar and starts to mix two drinks

WHITLEY
To the Order Please They’ve been
fighting the Mai for over a
thousand years They wouldn’t know
what to do with her if I handed her
to them on a goddamn silver
platter

SIMONE
She’s the Uniter Did you ever
consider that she might be too
valuable to simply kill

I didn’t ask for an opinion

Brian will never be safe as long as
she’s alive I just want to protect
him

Brian looks outside Again nothing This time he closes and
locks the door But when he turns around

Alek is standing right in front of him

Sorry But we both know I owed you
that one

BRIAN

Get out of my house

ALEK
Not quite so tough now that you
know I can filet you with only
minimal effort

BRIAN
What do you want

ALEK
First I want you to know that the
only reason I haven’t choked you to
death with your own intestines is
because Chloe asked me not to

BRIAN
Im deeply appreciative

ALEK
Like I said - it wasn’t my choice

Alek picks up the picture of Brian’s mom

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

BRIAN
Don’t touch that

Alek tosses it aside

ALEK
Second I’d like you to answer a
question Don’t worry - it’s easy
How do you know our little Chloe
Did fate actually draw you into her
store that first day

BRIAN
My feelings for Chloe--

And in a FLASH Alek slams him against the door

ALEK
I didn’t ask about your feelings I
want to know if you were sent
there

After a long beat

BRIAN
I found her name on my father’s
desk I thought it had something to
do with my mother’s death

ALEK
So you were lying from the very
beginning

BRIAN
The minute I walked in I knew that
she didn’t

(catching himself)
I thought that I knew---

ALEK
No further questions

Alek steps back

WHITLEY
He’s actually going to be fine
Thank you for asking

OLIVIA
I’m aware I stay fairly well
informed

Simone hands her the second drink that she made This doesn’t
go unnoticed by Whitley

OLIVIA (CONTD)
Thank you dear
(to Whitley)
You should be more careful when
checking references

Simone smiles at Whitley He doesn’t return it

OLIVIA (CONTD)
So you’ve started a war with the
Mai I’m very impressed I was
afraid that you were taking after
your father

WHITLEY
My father was a great man

OLIVIA
Your father was weak and a fool He
and that Mai whore of his deserved
everything they got

(she sips her drink)

I lost Jacob and I lost you So
youll understand that I can’t lose
my grandson too

WHITLEY
As long as I’m alive youll have
nothing to do with Brian

OLIVIA
Then I shouldn’t have to wait more
than a few minutes

Whitley looks at her quizzically - then down at his drink

WHITLEY
What have you done

OLIVIA
You have to understand I put it
off as long as I could

OLIVIA (CONTD)
I always hoped that you’d come back
to me on your own

Whitley’s head spins as he stumbles He reaches for the
phone but Simone places her hand on it and shakes her head

“no” He’s too weak to fight as he falls back into his chair

OLIVIA (CONTD)
But when you turned my grandson
against me - this moment was
inevitable He’s the last of the
Pure

WHITLEY
Brian will never--

OLIVIA

Youll be surprised what Brian is
capable of - he just needs the
proper motivation

(beat)
I thought when I had your beloved
Evelyn killed you’d come around
That you’d be by my side as we
finally finished what the Order
began so long ago

WHITLEY
You killed her

He lunges for her but falls short rolling onto his back
now slowly choking

OLIVIA
I simply wanted us to be a family
again Can’t you understand that

WHITLEY
(losing consciousness )
Brian
OLIVIA

Don’t worry about Brian I’1l take
good care of him

(gently)
He’s all I have left

almost heartbroken as Simone comes up behind her and they
gaze down on her now dead son After a beat Simone takes a

swings around and kicks her through the open window

The gun skitters across the asphalt

Jasmine lunges for Simone but the car SWERVES to avoid
hitting an oncoming truck Jasmine TUMBLES off the trunk and
rolls across the street

But if Whitley was behind all of
this why would they kill him

KNOCK from outside

The guards get their guns ready One motions to the other to
open the door But suddenly

Before the other guard can even react Chloe slams him in the
chest and HURLS him against the wall

CHLOE (CONT’D)
I guess this is the place

Chloe just keeps walking forward

Two more guards come running towards her SLAM Chloe takes
the first one out with a fist to the neck

The second one she drops to the ground by literally kicking
his feet out from under him OOF

CHLOE (CONT’D)
Don’t worry I’1ll show myself in

But as she turns around - SLAM She gets a KICK to the
stomach and goes flying through a set of wooden pallets

Chloe is instantly back on her feet but realizes that she’s
now surrounded by four THUGS - one with a large metal CHAIN
These guys don’t look like they’re going down easily But
looks are deceiving

CHLOE (CONT’D)
I swear sometime I feel like the
most popular girl at the party

Chloe is clearly the aggressor A kick to the chest An elbow
to the nose She FLIPS over one and takes out another

The guy with the chain comes for her but she’s able to wrap
it around her forearm when he flings it at her and yank him
violently towards her FIST CRUNCH

She runs up the wall and flips into another SWINGING around
a support beam to take out number four

Crash Thud One final round-house kick for good measure and
the last of the thugs fall to the ground unconscious

Chloe eyes the empty seat at the table

CHLOE (CONTD)
I assume we’re waiting for someone
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

SIMONE
Patience

OLIVIA (0S)
My apologies for keeping you
waiting

Olivia with her cane walks up to the table Chloe clearly
wasn’t expecting to see her

CHLOE
Olivia

OLIVIA
Hello Chloe It’s nice to see you
again

(to Meredith)
I envy you Sons can be so
difficult

CHLOE
You’re one of them

OLIVIA
My dear I am them

With a smile she takes her place at the table

INTEXT AMYS CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

The car is parked at the curb Amy is behind the wheel Paul
is on the phone

PAUL
Dude keep us posted We’re here if
you need us
(hangs up to Amy)
They found her Alek’s hurt but I
guess Jasmine and the rest of the
Mai on are on their way

AMY
That’s it

PAUL
It was a thirty second phone call

AMY
Did he say where they were

PAUL
Somewhere at the waterfront

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

AMY
Ohmigod you’re useless

Amy jams on the gas and the car peels out cutting off
another car as she makes a U-turn and speeds off down the
hill

EXT DOCKS - WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Alek is now up He’s torn up his jacket to put a little
padding around the wound There’s a noise behind him and he
spins around

It’s Jasmine

ALEK
Don’t do that

JASMINE
Are you alright

ALEK
Ill be fine Are you alone

JASMINE
Yes But the others are on the way
Where is she

ALEK
Somewhere inside

JASMINE
We should wait

ALEK
There’s no time

And after a beat they both take off toward the warehouse

INT WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Chloe Meredith and Olivia are still seated at the table

OLIVIA
I apologize for the surroundings
Id always pictured a windswept
plateau or perhaps something with a
view of the pyramids for our final
meeting But we had to improvise

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 78

CHLOE
You know if you want to kill me
there are a lot of easier ways

MEREDITH

Chloe Nobody wants to kill you
OLIVIA

Apparently the two of you don’t

talk

(beat to Chloe)
But what would be the point of
killing you

MEREDITH
See

OLIVIA
When you have so much else to
offer

She glances at Simone who sets down the golden chalice we saw
earlier at the meeting of the Order

CHLOE
What’s that

OLIVIA
They say it was the chalice of
Bastet - your creator Over the
centuries hundreds have died
seeking it But without you sitting
before it it’s just a useless tin
cup

CHLOE
You’re one of the Pure aren’t you

OLIVIA
I should have been - but no My
husband was as are my son and
grandson It’s been an honor to be
in their service

CHLOE
That’s why Brian didn’t die when I
kissed him
(to Meredith)
It’s a long--

MEREDITH
So beyond asking
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

OLIVIA
I was worried for a moment that
Brian was actually going to take
after his grandfather and be
seduced by the so-called Mai
charms

CHLOE
(sotto)
Alek
(to Olivia)
Your husband had a child with a
Mai didn’t he

OLIVIA
She was a whore and he was weak

Chloe can see Brian coming up behind Olivia

CHLOE
Is that why you had them killed

After a beat

BRIAN
Had who killed

OLIVIA
Brian there you are We’ve been
waiting I wouldn’t want you to
miss anything

EXT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Alek is at the window that Chloe was at before he has a
fairly clear view of what’s happening below Jasmine drops
down behind him

JASMINE
I count at least two dozen guards
Probably more All armed
ALEK
(re chalice)
Do you know what that is

JASMINE
No idea I’ve never seen it before

INT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Meredith looks quite upset

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

MEREDITH
You said you weren’t going to kill
her She’s just a girl Please

Simone puts a warning hand on her shoulder

CHLOE
Mom It’s okay

OLIVIA
I’m not going to kill her I just
need a life or two Or at least the
power that comes with them

CHLOE
And youll let my mom go

MEREDITH
Chloe

OLIVIA
It’s a promise Do we have a deal

CHLOE
We have a deal
(to Meredith)
I’1l be okay

Simone picks up the chalice and sets it in front of Chloe

SIMONE
Supposedly the Mai can give a life
or take a life at will --

CHLOE
But it costs them their own
(looking at the chalice in
confusion)
I thought I had to put my hand on
your chest or something

OLIVIA
Just open your mind and the chalice
will do all of the work
Chloe looks to Meredith

MEREDITH
I changed my mind - don’t do this

Chloe looks to Brian Olivia takes his hand After
beat

a long

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE
CHLOE
Give me the cup
And with a nod from Olivia Simone places it in Chloe’s hand
Instantly her fingers lock around the stem and her arm goes
tight CLOSE ON Chloe’s eyes as they FLARE Her palm starts
to glow--

And Chloe begins to die

MEREDITH
Chloe

OLIVIA
(seemingly genuine)
So painful watching a child die

Chloe gasps for breath and her body starts to convulse

EXT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Alek and Jasmine are still at the window
ALEK
They’re killing her We can’t wait
INT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Chloe’s skin is starting to sink into her face as her eyes
roll up into her head

BRIAN
Stop Make it stop

OLIVIA
Patience

ANGLE ON the chalice as it begins to fill with LIQUID BLUE
LIGHT The same light we saw flash through Valentina when she
died

Suddenly there’s a CRASH at the other end of the warehouse
Simone nods to several guards who take off running

Finally Chloe lets out an anguished blood-curdling SCREAM
And she slumps forward dead
EXT DOCKS - CONTINUOUS

Amy and Paul are getting out of the car when they stop

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

PAUL
Did you hear that

AMY
Chloe

But before they can take off

GARRETH (0S)
Wait

Garreth and a DOZEN MAT are behind them

GARRETH (CONT’D)
It’s too dangerous We can handle
it from here
(to Paul)
Thanks for watching out for her

And they take off running toward the warehouse After a beat
Amy and Paul exchange a look and take off after them But Amy
stops and runs back to the car grabbing a baseball bat out
of the back seat

AMY
(off Paul’s look)
What You only have to run into a
scary building and almost get
killed eight or nine times before
you learn your lesson

They take off for the warehouse

INT WAREHOUSE - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Jasmine trades blows with several guards OOF THUD A boot
to the head and another one goes down

Alek - despite his shoulder - disarms another guard and head-
butts a third
INT WAREHOUSE - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Olivia takes the chalice from Chloe’s hand A beat later
Chloe gasps for breath

MEREDITH
Chloe Ohmigod you’re alive

But it’s taking her a moment to come to There’s a another
LOUD CRASH

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

SIMONE
(to Olivia)
We should go

OLIVIA

Not until it’s done

(to Chloe as she starts

to come to)
This isn’t just a life I’m holding -
it’s the essence of the Mai You
are its keeper - it’s why they call
you the Uniter

(beat)
Which means when it’s gone so
are they

And Olivia steps back and begins to pour the glowing liquid
out of the cup onto the wooden floor

Instantly we hear anguished CRIES from around the building

INT WAREHOUSE - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Alek and Jasmine have both fallen to their knees as if they
were in great pain A guard takes the opportunity to kick
Alek and send him flying

EXT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Amy and Paul run up as Garreth and several other Mai are
trying to regain their footing - all obviously in pain

AMY
What’s happening to them

PAUL
I don’t know

But he grabs her hand and they keep running toward the front
door
INT WAREHOUSE - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The last of the liquid is poured out and the cries stop
Olivia smiles down at Chloe for a beat then

OLIVIA
Another

She starts to hand Chloe the chalice

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 84

BRIAN
You said one life You said you’d
let her mom go if she did that

OLIVIA
So let her go She’s useless to us
(beat)
I’m only doing what I have to do

She puts the chalice back in Chloe’s hand Once again
Chloe’s whole body seizes up and she begins to die As Chloe
gasps for breath we

FADE OUT

END OF ACT SEVEN

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

ACT EIGHT

FADE IN

INT WAREHOUSE - ENTRANCE - SECONDS LATER

Alek is starting to recover as we hear a CLICK There’s a gun
pointed at his head

AMY (0S)
Hey

The guard turns just as she swings the bat into his gut He
doubles over and she smacks him in the jaw with the short end
and he crumbles

PAUL
Wow - you really are a fast
learner

AMY

Are you alright

ALEK
I think so I just don’t know
what’s--

Aaaah And he drops down to his knees again clearly in great
pain

INT WAREHOUSE - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Olivia is just finishing emptying another chalice

OLIVIA
You’re doing wonderfully my dear
Just a few more

BRIAN
Grandma please

OLIVIA
Brian in a few more minutes the
entire Mai race will cease to exist
- and the world will have us to
thank for it
(beat)
Don’t disappoint me

She hands the chalice back to Chloe who is just starting to
come to

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

MEREDITH
(to Brian)
Please Make her stop She’s
killing her

Chloe suddenly GASPS for breath again--

BRIAN
No You can’t do this

He tries to pull the chalice from Chloe’s hand but it won’t
budge Chloe starts to shudder

OLIVIA
Brian what are you doing
(to Simone)
Stop him

He grabs his grandmother’s cane and hits the chalice as hard
as he can It goes flying across the room

And Chloe all at once comes back to life

BRIAN
Chloe

He immediately starts untying her Suddenly there is more
crashing coming from the entrance and all around The battle
is back on

SIMONE
Weve got to go

OLIVIA
No We can’t Help me up

MEREDITH
Allow me

Meredith rears back in her chair and slams both feet into the
table sending it crashing into Olivia She TUMBLES back
knocking over one of the flaming barrels

SIMONE
Olivia

OLIVIA
Don’t let her get away This is our
only chance

Chloe is free

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

CHLOE
(to Brian)
Thank you You have to get out of
here

We see that the flames are already spreading across the
floor Brian is busy working on Meredith’s ropes

BRIAN
Not without you I’m not

CHLOE
Let me do that
(to Meredith)
Just add this to the list okay

SWOOSH Chloe’s CLAWS come out Meredith GASPS But Chloe
instantly slices through the ropes and they fall to the
floor

CHLOE (CONTD)
(to Brian)
Take her with you Keep her safe
Ill be right behind

Brian takes Meredith’s hand and pulls her off Chloe spots
Simone and Olivia disappearing through a door on the far side
and takes off after them

INT WAREHOUSE - ENTRANCE

The battle is still raging and Jasmine Alek and the Mai try
to defeat the Order thugs

ON JASMINE

She sends one guard flying back through a glass partition
but the second the glass shatters FLAMES comes roaring
through it The place is engulfed

ON ALEK

He takes a hit to the shoulder - but powers through it takes
the guy down with a forearm to the face and a kick to the
chest But when he turns around he’s face to face with

Brian and Meredith

ALEK
Are you alright

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

MEREDITH
I’m fine But Chloe’s still in
there
Brian spots Paul
BRIAN

(to Paul re Meredith)
Here Get her out of here
(to Alek)
We have to find Chloe

After a long beat as the enemies face one another

ALEK
Let’s go

Brian and Alek race back into the FIRE to find Chloe Jasmine
sees them just as they run off

JASMINE
Alek

But he doesn’t stop A second later she takes off after him

INT WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

Chloe gets to the top of the stairs There’s only one way
they could have gone She races across the catwalk -
suspended fifty feet over the warehouse floor that’s
completely engulfed in flames

But just as she gets halfway across - Simone drops down on
her from above SLAM

Chloe tumbles and almost goes over the side But she flips
over and is able to send Simone flying back

Both women are instantly up and facing each other It seems
that Simone has no fear as she attacks Chloe defends but
Simone connects with a kick to the chest and Chloe slams back
into the railing

ON ALEK AND BRIAN

They’ve made it up to the network of catwalks but the one in
front of them is on fire

ALEK
Ill go up You go around

BRIAN
Up

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE 89

And Alek leaps into the rafters

BRIAN (CONT’D)
Up

Brian starts to go in the other direction but sees his
grandmother a level below pressed up against the wall
clenching the chalice to her chest

ON CHLOE AND SIMONE

Chloe flips over Simone and sends her flying back Kick
Slam Punch Simone is now on the defensive but she blocks a
punch and connects sending Chloe over the railing

Chloe hangs on with one hand for dear life Simone lunges
forward to kick her off when -

JASMINE
No

Jasmine slams into her sending her stumbling backwards
Chloe’s hand SLIPS - but Jasmine drops to the catwalk
reaching out and grabbing her wrist dropping the khopesh

JASMINE (CONTD)
Hold on

Simone gets back to her feet ready to finish this - Jasmine
and Chloe are both completely exposed Simone advances toward
them just as -

Alek races in from the opposite direction Simone is about to
knock them both over but as he ROLLS forward - he comes back
up in one graceful motion and -

PLUNGES THE KHOPESH into Simone Simone looks in shock at the
lethal wound

ALEK
Chloe’s Protector Nice to finally
meet you

And Alek pulls out the blade Simone hits the ground with a
thud

Jasmine pulls Chloe back up onto the catwalk just as the
catwalk starts to shudder

Chloe can see Brian below trying to get to his grandmother

CHLOE
Brian
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE
Chloe leaps over the edge onto one of the rafters and heads
toward Brian and Olivia

ON BRIAN AND OLIVIA

Brian is almost to her

BRIAN
Grandma Give me your hand

But she is clearly in her own world

OLIVIA
No - we’re too close We can’t stop
now

BRIAN
Come on

He grabs her trying to help but she slaps him across the
face Hard

OLIVIA
You’re no better than your father
and your grandfather

BRIAN
Please we have to go

OLIVIA
I can’t leave This is my life’s
work - bring me the girl - we can
finish I know we can

The platform she’s standing on starts to give way

BRIAN
Grandma

But it’s too late He reaches for her as it crumbles and she
falls back into the fires below

Brian starts to get up but the boards disintegrate beneath
him now He’s about to fall too until - a hand reaches out
and grabs him

Brian turns to find Chloe He stares at her a beat then she
pulls him back to safety

Chloe stretches in the sunbeam for a moment obviously in no
hurry to get out of bed
INT CHLOE’S HOUSEKITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

EXT MARINA GREEN - DAY

A glorious sunny day the water and bridge beautiful in the
distance Chloe is sitting at her bench with Amy and Paul

PAUL
So can we be upgraded to official
sidekicks or what

CHLOE
I don’t think that’1ll be necessary
anymore

AMY
Really We were finally getting
good at it

CHLOE

Well you are definitely my first

call if I ever need one again
(beat)

We should probably get to class

AMY
(looking off)
Why don’t we go ahead without you

Chloe looks back Brian is in the parking lot leaning
against his motorcycle

AMY (CONT’D)
(to Paul)
Let’s go

PAUL
A motorcycle Really Come on

But she pulls him away as Chloe gives him a little smile

EXT MARINA GREEN TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER
Chloe and Brian are walking along the bay

BRIAN
Dad always said I should go back to
college I figure it’s pretty good
advice

THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE

CHLOE
You’1ll be okay

BRIAN
I have friends there Actually my
life was pretty normal before I
moved back here You know before I
met you

CHLOE
I could probably say the same

After a beat

BRIAN
I’m sorry for everything I put you
through For everything we put you
through

CHLOE
Hey we don’t get to pick our
family right

He stops

BRIAN
I should probably leave well enough
alone - but I guess I haven’t
learned my lesson yet

CHLOE
What are you talking about

BRIAN
I told you I love you maybe half-a-
dozen times - and not all of them
when I was trying to kill you -
and um you never said it back

CHLOE
Brian

BRIAN
And that’s my answer
(beat)
It’s okay It’s probably for the
best But I’1ll miss you

CHLOE
I‘1l miss you too

And he kisses her good-bye on the cheek Chloe watches him
heading back to his motorcycle He gives a final wave before
he gets on Chloe waves back

As he drives away she looks back out to the bay And then
down the shore Something on the hill catches her eye and she
starts to smile

EXT WARMING HUT - SHORT TIME LATER

Chloe walks up the hill Alek with his back to her is
sitting on a picnic table looking out at the bridge

ALEK
(without turning around)
Do you ever wonder what would have
happened if you hadn’t met Brian
If you and I had met first

CHLOE
(sitting next to him
teasing)
We did meet first You were just a
jerk
(beat)
How much of that did you hear
ALEK
Not much It’s kind of windy

(beat)
But there are going to be a lot of
very unhappy Mai

CHLOE
Oh yeah Why’s that

ALEK
“When the Uniter loves the
offspring of her enemy the curse
will be broken” I’d say he was the
prime candidate for curse breaking

CHLOE
But not the only candidate
(beat)
Problem is - I think I’m in love
with someone else

ALEK
Really You move fast Chloe King

CHLOE
I learned from a master

He finally looks at her After a beat
THE NINE LIVES OF CHLOE KING SALVATION - BERENDSEN - MCGEE
