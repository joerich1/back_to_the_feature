around a GAZEBO where THREE MUSICIANS are struggling with

a trombone a saxophone and a tambourine They cant seem to
make the instruments work except for the tambourine player

that sound is coming from TCHICK KA-TCHICK-TCHICKY-TCHICK

brothers and sisters urgently waving his one good hand
like Frankensteins monster as if to say Bad Bad He has
learned that fireworks bring danger

A DEAD TEENAGE CHEERLEADER holding filthy pom-poms looks at
Big Daddy unable to grasp what hes trying to communicate

A SPEAR is DRIVEN through the Cheerleaders face The spear
is held like a lance by HARRY a guerilla who roars past on
his motorcycle hooting like a cowhand on round-up Other
BIKERS rumble down the street firing guns

RILEY
Mike Wait

But Mike has followed the others inside
INT UNIONTOWN STATE STORE - NIGHT

CHOLO unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously

into the dark space Every subtle SOUND in the SILENCE puts
MIKE more on edge His hand tenses on his gun as SHADOWS loom
in front of him Shadows that could be zombies but are not
Behind the dusty glass doors of a once-refrigerated wall-
unit Cholo sees a CASE OF DOM PERIGNON He goes to the

refrigerator Re-strapping his crossbow he opens the door
Reaches in for the case of champagne His two hands grab it

A THIRD HAND GRABS IT

Cholo looks up The refrigerator has no back wall A DEAD
THING with a Manson-like SWASTIKA tattooed in the center of
its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading
area beyond It GRABS Cholo with a terrifying GROWL

Cholo falls under the weight of the champagne and the
weight of the Dead Thing which drops on top of him They
roll struggling The Thing holds Cholo in a death grip

At the front of the store Mike fumbles with his rifle
Foxy shoots at the Dead Thing and misses

Cholo PUNCHES the Thing with his free hand The Dead Things
head recoils but lowers again toward Cholo the Swastika
looming drooling teeth baring for a bite Cholos eyes
flash Its the first time weve seen him scared

BLAM CHARLIE FIRES one round right into the center of the
swastika on the Zombies forehead The Thing crumples

MIKE
Nice shootin

CHARLIE
Good shootin Aint no such thing
as nice shootin’

A FOOT KICKS the Zombie off Cholo who looks up to see
RILEY extending a hand to help him to his feet

RILEY
Close one

CHOLO
Im still here aint I

Everyone relaxes Cholo picks up the case of Dom The others
head toward the front of the store

TILT DOWN TO THE FLOOR as their feet move past In the gloom
behind stacks of cartons

A DEAD HAND appears Reaching

CHOLO
Shit Look out kid

The hand grabs Mike around the ankle Mike turns raising his
gun Too late

A DEAD UNIFORMED POLICEMAN the skin on half its face STRIPPED
DOWN TO BONE RIPS A HOLE IN HIS LEG with its teeth

Mike SCREAMS staggers into a wall and drops to a seated
position on the floor Riley and Charlie spin around at the

sound of his cry Cholo closest to Mike pulls his crossbow
and fires an arrow through the Zombies head

CHOLO
Fuckin rookies

Cholo tucks away the crossbow grabs a box of Cohibas off a
counter and runs outside with Foxy Riley goes to Mike

RILEY
(Kneeling) Its alright son
Youre gonna be alright

MIKE
No Im dead You get bit by one
f those things and you become what
they are

Riley wraps a strong arm around Mike and lifts him Mike
quickly plants the barrel of his 45 under his chin and

BLOWS HIS OWN BRAINS OUT

Riley stunned lets the corpse slide to the floor He looks
into the rookies open eyes devastated

EXT MAIN STREET - UNIONTOWN - NIGHT
THE WHITE MOVING VAN THE T-BIRD AND THE JEEP roll out of
town in a convoy Trailing them THREE SADISTIC GUERILLAS on
MOTORCYCLES ROAR past firing

a HAIL OF BULLETS at A DEAD FAMILY on the sidewalk The
MOTHER FALLS Not shot It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down
to the ground by

-BIG DADDY Who GRABS the little GIRL next thrusting her
roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car The FATHER is
last Big Daddy grabs it from behind by its hair just as

»»-ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Fathers
neck Big Daddy is unhurt but spattered with BLOOD Not red
greenish-black The blood of the dead

heres a RIPPING SOUND as the Fathers NECK is PULLED APART
by the weight of its limp body The body DROPS to the street

The HEAD remains suspended in Big Daddys hand His face
contorts His mouth opens and closes trying to utter sounds
Big Daddy drops the head looking down at its befuddled eyes
with sympathy After a moment the sympathy is joined by
rage Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING
DOWN on the disembodied head CRUSHING ITS SKULL

The convoy ROARS off leaving a cloud of exhaust Big Daddy

sees Harrys downed motorcycle lying in the street The butt
of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag

Big Daddy goes over Pulls out the rifle Tests the weight of
it in his hand Curls his finger in through the guard and
pulls the trigger

BLAM A bullet ricochets off a brick wall Big Daddy is
startled at first Then he relaxes realizing the rifles
power With surprising dexterity he slings the weapons
strap over his head and across his chest patting the strap
as if comforted by it Turning he looks toward

THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE
HORIZON Thats the direction the convoy is headed Thats
where the bad men came from Thats where he wants to go

REVERSE ANGLE

With the city in the distance Big Daddy starts walking
NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him Soon there are MORE
None of them knows where they are going Or why All that
seems to matter is that they have a leader

EXT DEPOT - PRE-DAWN
DEAD RECKONING emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty

steel nostrils stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in
outdoor yard (We dont see how big the yard is Yet) A
SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the
supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward

a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS above which is a FADED SIGN
that reads SUBWAY (TO CITY)
In the bustle of activity HARRY the biker who was attacked
in town perspires as he helps unload He looks ill
RILEY walks past handing out bottles of beer to the men

Harry SPINS GROWLS LUNGES at Riley like a beast

Riley has no time to reach for his gun The Harry-Thing is
strangling him SMASHING the neck of a beer bottle on the
snout of Dead Reckoning Riley JAMS THE JAGGED GLASS into

the Harry-Things forehead Its body drops to the ground

PRETTY BOY

Riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret
INT SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAWN

A mile-long subway tunnel extends into BLACKNESS A wide
PLATFORM runs the length of the tracks at the head of which
A DERELICT TRAIN is parked

A CARGO CARRIER pulls out driving along the platform its
flatbed piled with supplies while ANOTHER CARRIER is being
loaded with boxes of food pharmaceuticals ammunition and

TWO BODY BAGS

CHARLIE

RILEY

The cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the
tunnel CEILING LIGHTS spaced far apart STUTTER on and off
Two guerillas ANCHOR and MOUSE who looks like a mouse ride
on the open flatbed with the cargo

The tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast
menacing shadows Mouse shifts nervously Suddenly

PLINK SOMETHING WET FALLS ON HIS FACE He JUMPS
Recovers Wipes his cheek with his sleeve

He takes out a joint Lights up The match FLARES SPLAT
Mouse and the match are soaked by WATER dripping from above

zone which is lined with taverns gambling clubs strip
joints like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days BUYERS

Riley is welcomed by nearly everyone he passes greeting
them in return with a smile and a nod handing some bills to
a FATHER with a YOUNG SON patting an OLD MAN on the back

CHARLIE
Wanna get a drink Riley Just

Charlie follows Riley who strides into

an alley surprised to find a cadre of rough-looking
REVOLUTIONARIES led by MULLIGAN a defiant man who stands
on a soapbox A small audience is gathered in front of him
He takes a swig from a bottle of whiskey

MULLIGAN

The LATCH SPLINTERS out of the frame The door BURSTS open

INT PENTHOUSE NUMBER-TWO - FIDDLERS GREEN - DAY
and CHOLO enters a dark foyer The only light comes from
another room somewhere inside A soft rhythmic SQUEAK like
a childs swing moving back and forth ECHOES through the
apartment Its an eerie incongruous sound

On guard eyes straining Cholo moves inside The squeak gets
louder the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees

a MIDDLE-AGED MAN HANGING DEAD from a HOMEMADE NOOSE
suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen THE BODY SWAYS
slowly the harsh glare making the mans face even whiter
than it is A toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet

Cholo stands transfixed for an instant And in that instant

HE IS GRABBED FROM BEHIND He whirls ready to kill but
finds only a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN 60-something wearing a
tailored suit and expensive jewelry her perfectness
blemished only by her hysteria

WOMAN
My Johnny he killed himself he
killed himself My Johnny My
Johnny

Cholo shakes her hard

CHOLO
Keep it together lady

Behind them in the kitchen unseen a dazed YOUNG MAN walks
up to the hanging corpse He rights the toppled chair and
steps on it lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose

YOUNG MAN
(Softly to himself) Dad Oh Dad

WOMAN
(To Cholo) Se-Security Are you
Security

CHOLO
No I

WOMAN

Then for Gods sake who ARE YOU

She resumes her SCREAMING
In the kitchen the Young Man is slicing through the rope
when his DEAD FATHERS EYES POP OPEN The Young Man is too

busy with the rope to notice THE HANGED MANS EYES BLINK
Once Twice Three times Its body TWITCHES And then

the Hanged Man turns making a move on the Young Man The
motion increases the strain on the light fixture which pulls
away SPARKING from the ceiling and CRASHES TO THE FLOOR
along with the Hanged Man and his son
The entire apartment is PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS The woman

stops her screaming Almost as soon as she does a SNARL can
be heard from the kitchen followed by another SCREAM this
one coming from the Young Man

Cholo rushes to a nearby fireplace and grabs a POKER and a
MATCHLIGHT which looks like a pistol but shoots FIRE from

its tip He approaches the kitchen using the FLAME to light
his way In the FLICKERING GLOW he sees

the Young Man lying on the floor CHUNKS have been bitten
out of his neck and wrist The body is CONVULSING in the last
moments of life THE HANGED MAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN

Cholo stands over the Young Man and stabs him in the head
with the poker jabbing the point all the way through The
woman SCREAMS again from the kitchen doorway

CHOLO
Shut up I gotta hear Whered he
go Whered the other guy go

Silence Cholo pulls the poker out of the Young Mans head
SHUFFLING sounds He follows them to the other end of the
kitchen probing the darkness with his matchlight

The sounds are LOUDER here Cholo lifts the poker ready to
strike Just as he does

the back door of the apartment BURSTS OPEN and a SECURITY
GUARD lunges into the kitchen rifle in hand

SECURITY GUARD
(To Cholo) Drop it

Cholo drops the poker and holds up his hands

CHOLO
Hey no problem

TWO MORE SECURITY GUARDS come through the apartments front
door and rush into the kitchen

CHOLO (CONTD)
No problem no problem But there
is a problem Theres a dead guy
walkin around in here

THE HANGED MAN appears without warning attacking one of the

guards who just entered BITING OFF half his left CHEEK
including the EYE

Before his partner can raise his gun THE WOMAN GRABS IT FROM
HIM Aims at the Hanged Man
WOMAN
YOU SELFISH BASTARD YOU LEFT ME

ALONE HERE
She fumbles with the weapon not knowing how to make it work
The bitten security guard starts to lose all strength in his
legs The Dead Thing holds him up as if waltzing with him
BITING HIM again and again
C

olo takes the gun from the woman and shoots the Hanged Man

BITTEN SECURITY GUARD
I need help I need help

Cholo kills the bitten security guard too

SURVIVING SECURITY GUARD
YouFUCK

Cholo turns the gun on the surviving security guard

CHOLO
You wanna talk about this I did
what I had to do I only did what I
had to do

TOUT

Riley is already in He has pushed past the Tout and is
striding into a fog where GAMBLERS are rushing to place bets
with heavily-armed BOOKIES Were reminded of a cock-fighting
joint in a Pancho Villa movie

RILEY
Lot of action tonight

TOUT
Gotta new kind of game
Riley strides toward a cluster of BETTORS A very tall man

stands among them wearing a Texas Stetson that sticks up
high above all other heads its peacock feathers poking even
higher out of a snake-skin hat band

Riley grabs him and spins him around

he mans feet are off the ground Way off the ground Far
from tall hes a little person who has been standing on a
platform wearing a purple satin pimp-suit Hes a Latino
who looks like a Chihuahua And thats his name CHIHUAHUA

INT BACKSTAGE - THE ARENA - DAY

In a dark CATACOMB DEAD MEN are chained to the walls WHAM
A POLE shoots out A NOOSE on the end encircles the neck of a
captive Dead Man and is cinched tight TWO MEN hold the pole
while A THIRD sprays RED PAINT on the Things face ANOTHER
DEAD THING is dragged in and sprayed with BLACK PAINT

INT BACK OFFICE - THE ARENA - DAY

Cursing in Spanish CHIHUAHUA pulls a GLOCK out of a filing
cabinet and jams a magazine up its butt

INT CENTER RING - THE ARENA - DAY

RILEY and CHARLIE drift into a large room thats packed with
BETTORS hooting and hollering like football fans Theyre all
jammed onto tiered wooden viewing stands arranged around an
IRON-MESH STRUCTURE that looks like a lion-tamers cage

Gates open THE PAINTED WALKERS are thrust inside the cage
Their nooses are released The gates are locked behind them

EAD RED alarmed by the color of DEAD BLACKS face reaches
out and gently touches the paint Its fingers come away with
blackened tips

lack follows suit staining its fingers red Black licks its
hand spitting when it identifies not blood but something
distasteful

BOOKIES drift among the spectators taking bets with fists
full of cash

CHARLIE
What are they betting on Riley

RILEY

fight

CHARLIE

CLANG Another gate opens in the cage A hush falls as
everyone awaits what will come Including the Dead Men who
gaze with anticipation at the opening What comes is

A WOMAN Alive badly bruised her dress in tatters
Despite tarnish she still looks sexy Last night she was a

hooker known as SLACK Now shes meat in a lion cage

RILEY
Jesus fucking Christ

The gate SLAMS shut The Dead Things walk toward the woman
Riley rushes off Charlie follows

lack backs up hits the wall of the cage and terrified
starts to circle its iron perimeter The Dead Men flank her
Black is the first to touch her The crowd HOWLS

lacks terror turns to determination She punches Black
three times in the face The Thing recoils as she glides out
of its grasp

RILEY and CHARLIE reach the BRUISERS who took their weapons

RILEY
Give us our guns

BRUISER
(Handing over the weapons) You

Riley cocks his M-16
RILEY

In a little while

In the ring BLACK reaches for SLACK again With one
lightning-fast move she kicks it in the chest sending it
flying into Reds arms Red shoves Black aside

Black makes another try for the woman Red grabs its rival
This time Black hangs on to Reds shirt The two twirl around
in a staggering lampoon of a wrestling match

Slack rushes to the side of the cage and starts to climb
Shes agile Strong But she almost falls as the cage SHAKES
with the force of

-Red SLAMMING Black against the mesh
On their way back through the arena RILEY and CHARLEY push
through the crowd trying to reach the center ring A GOON
steps in front of them

GOON
No guns in here

Riley gives him a rifle butt in the face and moves on
lack continues to climb the cage almost out of reach but
Black grabs one of her ankles pulling her down and slamming

her to the ground

Black hunkers drooling over Slack As it is about to bite
RAT-A-TAT A short burst from Rileys M-16 shatters Blacks

collarbone Cheekbone Skull The Thing drops

Red lunges for Slack Riley kills it with another short BURST

he crowd PANICS stampeding toward the exit Suddenly MORE
BULLETS FLY this time from a GLOCK FIRED by

CHIHUAHUA who in a rage is pushing through the LEGS of
the fleeing crowd He makes it to a clear spot and draws a
steady bead on a targetCharlie Chihuahua pulls his
trigger Riley beats him by an instant FIRING the M-16

Just as Chihuahuas gun GOES OFFa LINE of BULLET HOLES
PERFORATES the little mans belly The round from his Glock

misses Charlie completely

Riley runs to the cage where Slack stands trembling just
on the other side of the bars

RILEY
You okay

She nods gratefully

Chihuahua is still on his feet And now he is really pissed
Not because of the holes in his gut but because

CHIHUAHUA
My suit You fucked up my new suit

Riley turns to Chihuahua but doesnt have time to lift the
M-16 beforeBLAM The little man FIRES at him Slack
delivers a powerful KICK into the flexible fencing sending
Riley sprawling to the ground and saving him from

-Chihuahuas round which misses Rileybut HITS SLACK
Spun around by the impact she falls face down

Chihuahua continues to FIRE Riley Marine-crawls as bullets
PUNCH around him SPARKING off the cage Chihuahua keeps
coming keeps FIRING until

A SINGLE SHOT from Charlies 45 shatters his skull He
drops like a broken pinata

Riley looks up seeing TWO OTHER MEN with guns Chihuahuas
GOONS For a moment it seems as if a major shooting match is

going to break out But before it does

POLICEMAN (0OS)

Hold it

FOUR POLICEMEN burst in The Goons lower their weapons
Riley runs back to the cage BLASTS the lock on the nearest
gate and rushes inside Slacks body is lying on the floor
He suspects shes dead When her BODY MOVES he suspects
worse He plants the barrel of his M-16 against her temple

SLACK
Im alright IM ALRIGHT

Slack uses her left arm to push herself up to a sitting
position Her right arm is BLEEDING up near the shoulder

SLACK (CONTD)
Fucker got my right arm Ima lefty
They look into each others eyes

FENCES DOWN Only TONY BALONEY moves still waving spookily

CHARLIE
Geez Cholo made a mess

RILEY
Cholo didnt do all this

Clouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the
depot restricting visibility Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the
clouds reveal glimpses of torn BODY PARTS

RILEY (CONTD)
Stenches have been at this place

He leads the way into the depot his M-16 at the ready
Behind him all eyes peer nervously into the smoke Everyone
speaks in HUSHED tones

MANOLETE
When the truck pulled out it must
have knocked the fence down Thats

SLACK

Uniontown last time out Theyre

Thoughts darken So does the SMOKE which billows thicker
virtually blinding the team SOUNDS come The MOANING of the
WIND The POPPING of burnt metal and wood

TEAHOUSE
What do they want

Slack looks back as she walks The zombies have taken down
another section of the depot fence beyond which lies a
suburb Beyond which is the river Beyond which is the glow
of the FIDDLERS GREEN HIGH-RISE

their backs to each other guns searching for a target
Darting eyes peer into the void MORE NOISES emanate from

bullet buzzes just above her ear blowing a WISP OF HAIR as

A DEAD OLD MAN BEHIND HER DROPS a HOLE in its head

SLACK

The WIND shifts and black SMOKE envelopes them

MANOLETE

Riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash

The team fans out around the T-Bird The smoke is so thick
they cant make out anything Including each other

Charlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze What
he doesnt see what he cant see is whats behind him

a FEMALE WALKER wearing the soiled and tattered remnants
of a bridal gown The fabric seems to glow in the smoke
The bride shuffles toward CHARLIE We see it coming No one
else does Just as it opens its mouth to bite

BLAM Slack SHOOTS Her bullet cuts closer than the one
Charlie fired CLIPPING OFF THE TOP OF HIS EAR before

DROPPING THE BRIDE

out from under the dash As TEAHOUSE settles into a seat by
the door

SOMETHING heavy and wet SMACKS his shoulder Its a
FOREARM It drops onto Teahouse as if thrown at him

TEAHOUSE
God Oh GOD WHATS THIS

Teahouse HURLS the bloody thing onto the asphalt Shockingly
the ARM SPRINGS BACK THUMPING against Teahouses face A
twist of torn muscle no thicker than clothesline is keeping
the limb loosely attached to

A DEAD THING that has crawled beside the T-Bird Lifting
itself it BITES a large filet out of Teahouses arm CHARLIE
SHOOTS it

Manolete climbs up behind the wheel andVROOOOOMpedal
to the metal he pulls out of the depot Slack glances at

Teahouse then wind in her hair leans in close to Riley

SLACK
(Softly) How long does he have

RILEY
I had a brother Real brother by
birth Bit Hung on for six days
Before he turned I was the one had
to shoot him

SLACK
And you said nothin bad ever

KAUFMAN
I recognize that some of you are
concerned Weve been threatened by
a disgruntled employee Ive sent
people out to take care of the
problem However should something
go wrong I want to assure you that
measures have been taken Ive
established outposts With food and
supplies to support us on our way

On our way To where

KAUFMAN
Alternate sites have been chosen
Air transport has been arranged
For us and our families As well as
necessary support personnel

KAUFMAN
All the others can be replaced
by others

CLIFF
But

KAUFMAN

moment

Kaufman leads Cliff into

an alcove on the far side of the room shutting two pocket
doors made of sandblasted glass Sutherland and the others
cant hear but can see Kaufman and Cliff in SILHOUETTE

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOORS Kaufman leans close to Cliff
smiling his eyes blinking a bit too rapidly

KAUFMAN (CONTD)
You interrupted me I was just
talking about how people can be
replaced You dont want to be
replaced do you

CLIFF
(Nervous) No

KAUFMAN
No and I dont want to replace
you You have promise A day may
come when you earn yourself some
responsibilities Right now the
responsibilities are mine All
the responsibilities It was my
ingenuity that took an old world
and made it into something new I
put up fences to make it safe I
hired soldiers and paid for their
training I keep the people on the
streets away from us by giving them
their games and vices It costs me
money But I spend it because the
responsibility is mine Now do you
understand responsibility

CLIFF
Yes but

KAUFMAN
No buts

CLIFF

But
Kaufman looks disappointed Taking Cliff by the arm smiling
again he leads him over to an outer door and opens it An
armed SECURITY GUARD stands in the corridor outside

KAUFMAN
Take him out with the rest of the
garbage I wont be needing this
man anymore

At the conference table Sutherland sees the light coming in
from the outer corridor better defining the silhouettes as
the Security Guard drags Cliff away

where Cholo stuck him with the crossbow
SLACK reaches up and pulls off the bandana that holds back

her hair which cascades down
the blood off Rileys neck
He looks at her

SLACK

She uses the fabric to clean

touched by the familiarity of the gesture

Almost lost you there

Riley runs his finger along the monitor outlining the
natural and man-made barriers that protect the triangle

RILEY (CONTD)

throat

His finger continues down the monitor to THE THROAT at the
base of the triangle where the long FENCE runs between the
two rivers

He slaps a hand on Foxys back

EXCEPT ITS NOT FOXY Its ANOTHER WALKER that has moved
between the two men It grabs the hand that slapped him and
BITES it

CHOLO
AHHH FUCK

Foxy a few yards away whirls aiming his gun at the Walker
Cholo is faster With no time to reload in agony he pulls
a FISTFUL OF ARROWS from his quiver and DRIVES THEM THROUGH
THE WALKERS FACE AND SKULL The Walker falls So does an
ominous silence

chuckle) Nothin works out Its

closer firing trying to pick the critters off

The rats reach Riley Nip at his heels He leaps Swings onto
a girder Climbs to the control booth The rats dont follow
Slack heaves a sigh of relief just before

She vaults over a railing dropping several feet to

generator He flips it The motor roars to life

He turns toward a giant lever that operates the roadbed It
GROANS from disuse as he pulls it

SLACK shoves one into the river climbing onto its upturned
bottom She pushes off The boat doesnt budge A tether
holds it within inches of the shore

Slack pulls out a jackknife and goes to cut the rope but

rats SNAP at her hands Slack recoils but keeps cutting
Finally the rope frays enough for the boat to pull free

Slack crouches on top of the upturned hull No way to steer
No paddles The current carrying her away

his head back toward the enormous GEARWORKS of the bridge

drops with a PLUNK into the river below

EXT RIVER - NIGHT

SLACK adrift on the boat lies prone at the bow and begins
to paddle with her hands One of which hits something long
and slimy It looks like a snake

But its not Its only a moss-covered rope Slack grabs on
Pulls hand over hand It seems to take forever for the rope
to become taut

A FACE BOBS OUT OF THE WATER
Slack SCREAMS
Its the BRIDGEKEEPERS HEAD its eyes blinking as it floats

off on the current

The rope is attached to a stanchion on the opposite shore
Slacks muscles strain as she pulls on it until
her boat reaches the stanchion and she jumps off finding
herself at the same boat ramp the army of the dead used The
river has carried her into the very part of the city Riley
and the team were trying to avoid SCREAMS rise nearby Shes

Slack runs off with Brian past a MANHOLE surrounded by
canvas fences CAUTION signs and flaming OIL POTS As
MAINTENANCE WORKERS scramble out of the manhole

DEAD THINGS close in The Workers unarmed pick up the
ball-shaped pots and BOWL them at the Walkers As the balls
roll their FIRES SWIRL making them look like flaming comets

Some of the pots CRACK OPEN creating POOLS OF FIRE on the
street One of the balls remains whole until it smacks
against the feet of a Walker Then it opens And the Walker
is engulfed in flames
Big Daddy looks at the Walker with sadness He lifts his
rifle again and shoots the flaming creature in the head

Big Daddy walks to the manhole TOOLS are strewn around it
pickaxes sledges chainsaws and a pneumatic hammer which is
lying on the streetRATTATATTATstill running

Big Daddy looks at the FIDDLERS GREEN SKYSCRAPER His goal

Finally in reach

He looks down at the pneumatic hammer and picks it up by the
handle With the heavy tool vibrating in its hand Big Daddy

walks toward the building

He doesnt get very far before the hammers electrical cord
is pulled out of the extension its plugged into The hammer
stops running Big Daddy looks at it Puzzles over its
stillness for a moment Then

-he looks at the building At its doors abandoned by
guards Doors that are made of glass

The barrel of an M-16 is planted against Big Daddys temple
by a MILITIAMAN

UDDA-BUDDA-BUDDA The Militiaman FLIES BACK It wasnt he
who fired It was NUMBER NINE standing nearby with her M-16
The Militiaman lies on the ground his dead eyes staring at
Number NINE in utter surprise

Seeing what has happened ANOTHER SOLDIER grabs a grenade
pulls the pin and is about to toss it at Big Daddy when

-his HAND IS CUT OFF at the wrist by a meat clever held by
THE BUTCHER The Soldiers hand still clutching the grenade

PLOPS into the street The Soldier looks down in horror then
collapses on top of his hand A MUFFLED EXPLOSION makes jelly

hammer to POUND at the safety glass

gun which skitters away Knipp rushes over to help Kaufman

for it Dragging himself on hands and knees

first tool to PENETRATE the doors The glass doesnt shatter
it COBWEBS into tiny crystals stuck together by a thin
plasticine coating ALARM BELLS SOUND

Puzzled by the sudden transformation of the glass into
something that looks different Big Daddy drops the pneumatic
hammer and reaches out The glass is different Its soft
Flexible Big Daddy POKES HIS HAND right through

Kaufman has almost reached his gun Cholo shoots another
arrow This one hits Kaufman in the shoulder

teeth against the pain reaching out for his gun as

CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH More tools PENETRATE the doors More
HANDS POKE through

Kaufman looks at his worst nightmareDead Things ripping
their way through the cobwebbed doors invading his temple

The commotion distracts Cholo just long enough for Kaufman to
lift his gun and FIRE nine rounds

Most of the shots miss TWO hit Cholo one in the belly one
in the heart He is slammed against the wall his glazing
eyes staring up into the atrium the place he so desired
Its the last thing he sees before he keels over dead

FIRES A BULLET HITS BIG DADDY in the upper chest blowing
DEAD FLESH out of his back The Dead Man feels no pain but
it focuses on Kaufman and starts after him with purpose

not dead Kaufman fires again CLICK Hes out of ammo

trapped herded by HUNDREDS OF WALKING DEAD against the layers
of electrified fencing that were erected to protect them

the CLATTER of its treads He moves toward the sound as

a DEAD THING looms three feet away Riley lifts his pistol
and puts a shell through the things skull Blood flies
taking on the sudden glow of a halo as it is BACKLIT by

helps the wounded KAUFMAN across an underground PARKING
GARAGE a dark and spooky place made more so by the SOUNDS
of distant SCREAMING Kaufman disdainfully SNAPS OFF the
shanks of the arrows in his leg and shoulder

The two men reach a stretch LINCOLN Knipp BEEPS the doors
open and they get inside Knipp behind the wheel Kaufman in
the luxurious back compartment where he pours himself a
scotch from the built-in bar
Knipp starts the engine The SOUND ECHOES big-time in the
concrete tomb

KNIPP
(Looking at the fuel gauge) We
need gas

Kaufman moans Knipp steers the car slowly carefully through
the shadows pulling in beside a GASOLINE PUMP near the base
of a RAMP that leads up to the street Knipp pushes a button
that pops open the gas tank He shuts the engine off and gets
out taking the keys which have a Mag-Card attached to them

He slides the Mag-Card into a slot activating the pump An
LED scrolls Thank you Mr Kaufman Knipp pulls the nozzle
Freezes when he hears

FOOTSTEPS ECHOING A DARK FIGURE is approaching through
the shadows

Knipp drops the nozzle Ducks into the car SLAMS the door
WHAM A SINGLE HAND SMACKS against the driver-side window

inside The window is tinted He returns to the clear
windshield looks back at an angle and sees Kaufman in the
rear compartment Big Daddy recognizes him From upstairs
Its the man who shot him

The Dead Thing looks up Sees the gasoline pump His hand
drops to the embroidery on its jump-suitTexaco He moves
deliberately toward the pump

KAUFMAN
Pull out PULL OUT

KNIPP
Sorry sir Keys are in the pump

Big Daddy sees the nozzle on the cement Picks it up feeling
the familiarity of it Pulls the trigger Gasoline squirts
The rage in his face turns to a kind of satisfaction

Using the nozzle as he did the pneumatic hammer Big Daddy
POUNDS on the windshield three times before the SAFETY
GLASS COBWEBS He POKES the nozzle through the flexible
fabric and pulls the trigger until it locks Gasoline FLOODS
into the car

tries to run he is GRABBED by Big Daddy

Big Daddy looks at the butler Sniffs him Then flings him
aside Knipp is not his prey With a glance at Kaufman
cowering in the back seat Big Daddy slams the car door and
surprisingly walks away Up the ramp toward the street

The nozzle remains stuck in the fabric of the windshield
Gasoline continues to flow into the car Kaufman crawls into
the front seat wincing from his wounds and KICKS the nozzle
out of the window with his good leg getting soaked with gas
in the process He opens the door Limps to the pump Grabs
the keys As he starts back toward the car

WHAM SOMETHING is standing right in front of him Its

dawning) Oh my God Youre dead

Leans over him Opens a drooling mouth Kaufman whimpers
