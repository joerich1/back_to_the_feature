From 1964 to 1966 I successfully

Pan Am Airlines and flew over two
million miles for free During that
time I was also the Chief Resident
Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital
the Assistant Attorney General for
the state of Louisiana anda
Professor of American History at a
prestigious University in France By
the time I was caught and sentenced
to prison I had cashed over six
million dollars in fraudulent checks
in 26 foreign countries and all fifty
states and I did it all before my
18th birthday To this day I am the
only teenager ever to have been placed
on the FBI s most wanted list
