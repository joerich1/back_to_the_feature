OVER BLACK -- OUR PROLOGUE
A MALE VOICE NARRATES casual matter-of-fact

CHURCHILL (VO)
Ages ago it first appeared

AT A SHADOWED ALTAR an EGYPTIAN SAGE hovers over

CHURCHILL (VO)
Eternity’s Gate

It’s an IVORY BOWL so pure it seems to reflect infinity
itself Into its rim he inserts THREE KEY-LIKE OBJECTS
that angle upward and inward to form a pyramid

CHURCHILL (VO)
No one knows for sure where it came from
but legends say it can pierce time --
peer into the past glimpse secrets long
hidden

A GLOW forms around the Gate as the Sage pauses to
scribe A DRAWING of it onto A PARCHMENT -- then places a
GOLDEN LOOP on the pyramid’s apex squints as the GLOW
FLARES TO BLINDING WHITE

CHURCHILL (VO)
Problem is along with it came a Curse

THE SAGE LIES DEAD eyes lifeless the Gate and its parts
scattered by his sprawled arm

CHURCHILL (VO)
Something about disturbing the forces of
the universe Not that that ever
stopped anyone from wanting it

TWO WARRIORS battle fiercely a cloth bag holding the
bowl and its parts lying between them

CHURCHILL (V0O)
Mainly because people always believe they
can get around the Curse -- that maybe
it’s not real

Both Warriors are MORTALLY STABBED
CHURCHILL (VO)
Fools Then somewhere along the way

the Gate was lost

AN EGYPTIAN SHIP sinks men diving off of it the bag
with the Gate and its parts FLOATING TO SHORE
THEN A DOG carries the bag through a BUSTLING MARKET
BURIES IT in the dirt floor of a stall TROTS OFF

THE SAME MARKET centuries later now just crumbling
stone sand -- and TANKS BATTLING Germans versus the
Allies A BLAST and the THE GATE is uncovered

CHURCHILL (VO)
Until like a bad penny it reappeared

IN THE AFTERMATH a German soldier picks up the decayed
bag with the Gate and its parts THROWS IT CARELESSLY
into a cart with other booty a BRIEF GLOW FADING as
the LOOP FALLS OUT and is tossed into another cart

CHURCHILL (VO)
The thing is almost no one knew what
they had Which didn’t keep people from
looking for it

Soldiers wheel carts toward U-BOATS the Gate going to
THE U-231 the Loop heading elsewhere -- ONE MAN seeing
the Gate and keys KAPITAN GUNTHAR KEMP intrigued

CHURCHILL (VO)
From wondering where it went

AMONG OTHER SUBS the U-231 submerges -- and AS WE HOLD
ON THE WATER bubbling --

CHURCHILL (VO)
Or the Curse from striking again

A JAGGED CRACK OF LIGHTNING PIERCES THE SKY
and WAVES CRASH on a STORMY NIGHT WORDS APPEAR

The Chesapeake Bay
January 1945

And A VINTAGE CAR SKIDS to a stop TWO MEN step into a
FIERCE LASH of wind and rain OSCAR SMITH hatchet-faced
and SEBASTIAN MEEKER bookish in their 20s here on
furtive business They glance to --

A DOCK -- seeing illuminated by the sweeping beam from a
nearby LIGHTHOUSE waiting GUNTHAR KEMP in a Nazi
Uniform the U-231 LOOMING behind him The SAME CAPTAIN
we saw above ANOTHER LIGHTNING FLASH takes us to

THE THREE MEN HUDDLED ON THE DOCK -- MAKING A PACT

bending against the wind hands clasped together each
clutching AN ANCIENT KEY the keys we’ve seen before
SMITH
These keys bind us so that none may
proceed without the other -- so our

secret remains between us Agreed
Their faces show grim assent and as THUNDER RUMBLES --
MEEKER AND SMITH -- LATER

watch the u-boat fight its way from the bay through
CRASHING WAVES and JAGGED BOULDERS swallowed by thick
fog Suddenly there’s the GRINDING SQUEAL of METAL
AGAINST ROCK --

-- and with the sickening sound of METAL GIVING WAY --
with Meeker’s face creased with concern -- as another
LIGHTNING FLASH CRACKS

INT A ROWDY AND BOISTEROUS CANTINA -- NIGHT

South American natives drinking CHEERING on TWO MEN who
ARM WRESTLE across a wooden surface More words appear

The Andes Mountains
Five Years Ago

And a door BLOWS OPEN icy wind FLURRYING SNOW past
THOMAS CHURCHILL OUR NARRATOR Day-old beard scruff
grad-school-rumpled He pulls down the furred hood of
his jacket and looks around on a mission

MOMENTS LATER
Churchill leans in to a GRIZZLED BARTENDER urgent
CHURCHILL
I’m looking for someone Professor Myers
-- from the dig Was he here
The Bartender just stares Churchill plops down money
THE BARTENDER
He was looking for the old German
Jaeger
CHURCHILL
(surprised)

There’s a German Where

The Bartender stares Churchill impatient plops down
more money

THE BARTENDER
Try Hell
The Bartender points we see now that the Arm Wrestlers
are straining over A COFFIN Damn

CHURCHILL
This German -- did he leave anything
behind Is that where the Professor is

The Bartender stares again This time Churchill grabs
the Bartender’s collar JERKS HIM

CHURCHILL
I’m out of money and patience
(snatching back his money)
Now where’s the Professor

INT A SHADOWED SECOND-STORY ROOM -- AT THAT MOMENT

WIND WHISTLES a gas LANTERN FLICKERS Crouched at a
trunk PROFESSOR JAMES MYERS late-30’s an academic a
good man who’s waited long for this moment He hesitates

Then CRACKS OPEN the trunk Sees A NAZI UNIFORM neatly
folded -- under it clothes and possessions -- and an
OILCLOTH PACKET that he takes out opens Inside of it
are AGED YELLOWED PAPERS -- lists typewritten pages --

-- and A MANIFEST listing subs -- U-658 U-339 -- and
their officers One name in particular stops him
KAPITAN GUNTHAR KEMP associated with THE U-231 He
almost can’t believe what he sees

A GOLDEN SHIMMER comes from the trunk as if light flared
and died James reaches carefully removes a small LOOP
OF GOLD -- the one we’ve seen before His eyes shine
with excitement --

And A SOUND comes from outside the door and as he looks
THE DOOR TO THE ROOM IS SHOVED OPEN

Churchill on the landing Surveying a now empty room
and the trunk and an open window wind blowing curtains
He moves to the window sees FOOTSTEPS IN THE SNOW
leading to the cantina -- as OVERLAID a PHONE RINGS

WILL (PRELAP)
Hello

INT A TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY ROOM
WILL MYERS 8 years old James’ son an earnest open

boy has just answered his phone He doesn’t know it
yet but this is the last time he’1l talk to his Dad
JAMES (FROM THE PHONE)
Will Will it’s me

WILL
Dad

CROSSCUT TO THE BOISTEROUS BAR -- AND JAMES

on a decades-old pay phone scanning the crowd
suspiciously the packet and Loop clutched against him

JAMES
I found it son I finally found it

Will’s mother SARAH has just picked up an extension

SARAH
James Found what

JAMES
Evidence Sarah A manifest froma
German supply Sergeant -- and more

showing that a u-boat did go to the US
With the lost treasure and maybe with
Eternity’s Gate too Eternity’s Gate
Sarah Do you know what that means

Will’s eyes widen with wonder aware of the significance
JAMES
But I need to send it all to you I
don’t know who to trust and if it should
fall into the wrong hands --
SUDDENLY WILL AND SARAH --
hear THE BUZZ of a DIAL TONE They’ve been cut off

SARAH
--- James James

AS BACK IN THE BAR

James has just hung up the phone Because next to him
is Churchill Staring at him with -- concern Menace

CHURCHILL
Professor You left camp without telling
anyone Is something wrong Did you
find what we’ve been looking for

James just stares He’s hidden the Parchment and the
papers behind his back Churchill trying to get a look
But JUST THEN Churchill SPOTS TWO MEN ENTERING the bar
one squat the other towering HAWKINS and QUORT Their

eyes meet -- and Churchill SWEEPS DRINKS off the bar
starting an INSTANT MELEE -- chairs TOSSED PUNCHES
thrown --

-- James plunging into and through the chaos Churchill
TRYING TO FOLLOW -- but BLOCKED by Hawkins and Quort
jerking his head as Quort SMASHES A FIST through a wall

Desperate Churchill SEES THE COFFIN PULLS IT OFF ITS
STAND and it LANDS WITH A THUNK knocking Quort and
Hawkins back the BODY SPRAWLING OUT Churchill bolting --

OUTSIDE -- WHERE HE BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR

sees James fleeing into the teeth of the blizzard and
takes off after him Hawkins and Quort emerge and
follow all of them swallowed by the snow

WHILE BACK IN THE FAMILY ROOM -- SARAH’S ON THE PHONE

SARAH
(frantic with worry)
Yes Operator I’ve been cut off Can
you help me Please it’s an emergency

And as Will listens his face etched with concern his
life changed forever

MATCH DISSOLVE TO
WILL -- NOW 13 YEARS

The Golden Loop on a leather necklace around his neck as
he gives a POWER POINT PRESENTATION to his HISTORY CLASS
PROJECTED IMAGES SHIFTING between photos and video of

Nazis marching subs being loaded and submerging jewels

WILL
1945 The end of World War II and high-
ranking German officials realizing the
end was near used a secret convoy of u-
boats to transport stolen bounty to South
America Gems artifacts gold -- in
short a fortune in treasure

Darby Maryland
Present Day

The class hangs on every word Except for Will’s best
friends AUSTIN BROWN and LILY CHEN who are wary about
what Will might say next -- and the teacher MR GRAY
equally wary OLD NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS are now projected
WILL
Around the same time on a stormy night
there were reported sightings of a u-boat
near us in the Chesapeake Bay -- and
here’s where it gets really interesting

Austin and Lily share a look uh oh Gray’s brow furrows

WILL
There have long been theories that that
very u-boat had been shanghaied -- stolen

-- from the convoy by a German Captain --
and that it carried among its treasure a
legendary lost artifact --

MR GRAY
Mr Myers --

WILL
(speeding up)
-- and that it was brought here so its
contents could be hidden by unknown co-

conspirators --
WILL MR GRAY
-- but the sub sank -- Mr Myers --
WILL
(fast)

--- which means that somewhere at the
bottom of the Chesapeake lies an ancient
magical artifact and lost Nazi treasure

MR GRAY
Mr Myers enough I’ve warned you this
is history class not Mythology 101

WILL
But this isn’t a myth it’s a valid
historical theory

MR GRAY
It’s mere speculation Name me one
reputable expert who believes otherwise

Lily and Austin hands shoot up hoping to interrupt

AUSTIN LILY
Mr Gray Mr Gray

WILL
My father

Austin and Lily sag they tried Will stares defiantly
MR GRAY
Mr Myers Your father was a fine
man who had some unfortunate obsessions
Including a belief in this fairy tale

WILL
My father Was a professor who did what
any true historian should do went and
searched for history instead of sitting
on his giant butt passing judgement

Austin and Lily bury their heads in their hands

THE CLASS
« Ooooh

A DIGITAL CAMERA VIEW OF THE PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE -- LATER

Will sits in front of the Principal Gray pacing angrily
occasionally jabbing a finger at Will

AUSTIN (0S)
Wonder what they’1l do to him this time

LILY (0S)
You shouldn’t be spying And since when
does a phone have telephoto capabilities

EXT A QUAD OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL -- AFTERNOON

Austin’s aiming his cell phone at the office while Lily
skillfully plays with a hacky-sack

AUSTIN
Since I got a chip from an uncle who
knows a guy who cloned a prototype
(re Will)
Maybe chop off a thumb

Three girls pass Austin flashing what he believes is an
irresistible smile

AUSTIN
Ladies

LILY
Austin No one thinks you’re charming

AUSTIN
Of course they do Id be offended if I
didn’t know you were kidding

LILY
I’m not kidding I don’t even like you
AUSTIN
Sure you don’t You got candy My blood
sugar’s plummeting

They sit and Lily roots through her backpack pulling
out various items chapstick a Swiss Army knife etc

AUSTIN
Seriously You think he’ll be suspended

LILY
Hope not But telling us about the
treasure is one thing putting it ina
report and calling the teacher a butt is
another

She hands Austin a candy bar He’s been watching her
take things out with fascination

AUSTIN
I’ve got a little cut too
(she hands him a band-aid)
And ear wax
(she pulls out a q-tip)
That is amazing

LILY
I have a Chinese Mom She sends me out
prepared for any possible disaster
natural man made or interstellar

Will is fuming his way toward them

AUSTIN
(WHAPPING her arm)
Quiet Here he comes

LILY
(PUNCHING Austin hard back)
Don’t you ever touch me again

AUSTIN
Owww You’ve got major rage issues you
know that
(to Will)

So what’s it to be Hanging Flogging

WILL
(flopping onto the lawn)
Aaaaaaaaagh

AUSTIN
Alright listen don’t panic we’ll get

through this
(MORE)
AUSTIN (CONTD)
I’ve got a cousin who’s a lawyer sure he
got his degree online but he could plead
insanity or at the very least offer a
hefty bribe

LILY
It’s not like you didn’t know better
AUSTIN
And she will not be a character witness
WILL
More community service at the public
library -- at this point it might as well
be a permanent job -- and either an F or

a make-up paper as long as I stick to --
(making quote marks)
-- ‘historical fact’

LILY
Which of course you’1ll do because you
want to become an ‘historian’ and F’s
won’t get you into college Last month
it was the Library of Alexandria before
that Atlantis When will you learn

AUSTIN
You know young lady there’s more to
life than grades

LILY
Yes well some of us need scholarships
to get into college and unlike you I
have ambitions beyond reform school

AUSTIN
Why do you constantly seek to wound me

A distant HONK Austin peers

AUSTIN
It’s your Mom You think she heard
(waving)

Hi Dr Myers
Will’s Mom stands by her car hands on hips angry

LILY
She heard

INT WILL’S HOUSE -- LATER -- AS WILL STORMS IN

his Mom trailing and FLINGS his backpack down

WILL
Itd be great if my own mother took my
side for once

SARAH
That’s not the point --

WILL
It is the point Everyone thinks he was
crazy How can you just let them

SARAH
Will Your father and his theories -- do
you know how often I saw him try to prove
them and fail

WILL
(lifting the Golden Loop)
What about this This isn’t a failure

SARAH
It’s a loop of gold Maybe associated
with an artifact in a treasure no one’s
ever found that he died pursuing

WILL
That he sent after the phone call which
means he might not be dead

SARAH
Will I loved him I wish he were with
us But it’s been years He’s gone I
don’t want you to end up like him is all
Chasing things that arent there

A beat and

WILL BANGS OUT OF THE HOUSE

-- stalks to AN OUTBUILDING Sarah watching him sadly
AND INSIDE THE OUTBUILDING -- IS JAMES’ OFFICE
Marvelously cluttered with manuscripts books artifacts
WILL SITS in a CAPTAIN’S CHAIR out of Verne’s Nautilus
near a window EARLY EVENING LIGHT spilling over him

On his lap is a SCRAPBOOK ‘To Young Explorer Will From
His Questing Dad in Honor of his 8th Birthday For all
the adventures that have been and all those to come’

He turns pages SEEING PHOTOS of Will with James and

Sarah in front of Mt Rushmore near a crumbling Egyptian
pyramid James and Will pointing at cave paintings

And THE LAST PHOTO of James with his arm around Will --
the caption underneath reading ‘Off to Find the Lost
Treasure and Eternity’s Gate’ As Will thinks --

A FLASHBACK SEPIA TONED -- WILL IN HIS DAD’S OFFICE

JAMES
(kneeling in front of Will)
History Will doesn’t just teach us
about the past It gives us truths about
today and can warn us about tomorrow
That’s why Eternity’s Gate is important

AND AS THE WILL OF THE PRESENT -- SUNSET FRAMING HIM
closes the book missing his father
A QUICK FLASH -- OF A MAN

CRASHING through a second story window tumbling down a
slanted tiled roof -- two MEXICAN POLICIA leaning out of
the window SHOUTING -- others SWARMING HIM as he HITS
THE GROUND As we see the man is CHURCHILL --

INT A MEXICAN JAIL -- AT DAWN

Churchill lies on a ratty bunk staring at the ceiling
unshaven gone a bit to seed since the last time we saw
him A GUARD TILTS in a chair outside the cell

THE GUARD
One more hour and you will wear the
hangman’s noose

CHURCHILL
It was bound to happen some day my
friend Do you believe in curses

THE GUARD
Any reasonable man does

CHURCHILL
I can’t run from mine So que sera sera
And this sera was almost worth it Wake
me when it’s time

He places a hat over his eyes -- as a MEXICAN LAWYER
seersucker suit slightly seedy approaches the Guard

THE LAWYER
Get up

CHURCHILL
I still have an hour Let me sleep

The Lawyer gives some documents to the Guard

THE LAWYER
His bail has been covered the judge has
been bribed the senorita and her father
have been paid for the indiscretions

Churchill raises his hat peers at the lawyer what’s
going on The Lawyer holds out a photo to him

THE LAWYER
This man has been looking for you
(off Churchill’s surprise)
A plane is waiting
A PLANE BANKS THROUGH CLOUDS IN THE NIGHT SKY
Jet engines WHINING and then
EXT A GOTHIC MANSION -- NIGHT

Perched above the ocean thick clouds blocking the moon
An URGENT DOORBELL rings DING DONG DING DONG

AND THE FRONT DOOR OF THE MANSION
is SHOVED OPEN Framed is Churchill

CHURCHILL
Where is he

Only echoes and shadows He bounds up a SWEEPING
STAIRCASE past A PORTRAIT of a younger version of the
master of the house Sebastian Meeker who made the pact
decades ago From darkness THE BUTLER looms and

A MOMENT LATER The Butler’s on the phone as we see who
it is Hawkins from the Andes a Cockney

HAWKINS
It’s Churchill He’s here

INT A MOVING LIMOUSINE

On a phone listening is ROGER TORRANCE Errol Flynn
with the heart of a snake With him is the giant from
the Andes Quort As Torrance scowls and the CHAUFFEUR
an icy blonde MIRA FLOORS IT

INT MEEKER’S BEDROOM
Meeker frail much aged lies in his bed CANDLELIGHT

FLICKERING his eyes closed A SHADOW crosses him
Churchill at his bedside Meeker stirs sees him

MEEKER
You’ve come

CHURCHILL
Not that I don’t appreciate the timing
but why now after so many years

MEEKER
My guilt and fear kept me silent But
now there’s only absolution

CHURCHILL
(leaning forward intense)
Is this about the Curse

MEEKER
I brought it on us as you suspected

CHURCHILL
I knew it It’s because of the Gate
isn’t it Where is it

MEEKER
Hidden

Fading Meeker presses something into Churchill’s hand A
RING with an amethyst inlaid into a DISTINCTIVE CREST

MEEKER
There’s a trail Things sent away

He pulls Churchill close murmurs what only Churchill can
hear Then Meeker’s eyes widen he’s seen something

MEEKER
Because -- a spy There

Meeker jabs a finger at HAWKINS IN THE DOORWAY Quort

with him -- then clutches Churchill’s arm hard
MEEKER
Forgive me Find the Gate Lift the
Curse
And Meeker dies -- just as Hawkins FLINGS A SHIRUKIN that

IMBEDS WITH A THUNK next to Churchill’s head

Churchill tries to get to the door but he’s blocked by
Quort -- who moves with a quickness that belies his size
and THROWS CHURCHILL into furniture

Another SHIRUKIN WHIZZES and Churchill rolls dodges and
TOSSES A LAMP that BOUNCES OFF QUORT like a toy
Churchill circles

CHURCHILL
Guys what say we chat about old times
instead of indulging in this violence
Hawkins pulls out a long dagger

CHURCHI

Or not

Churchill looks around sees only one way out Sighs

CHURCHI
Just once Id like to leave by the front
door like a reasonable person

And he CRASHES THROUGH a window Quort and Hawkins see
Churchill staggering to a motorcycle and SPEEDING OFF

TORRANCE ENTERS Mira behind him

TORRANCE
Well

HAWKINS
Meeker got on to me somehow But I
overheard He sent some things away

TORRANCE
Find out where

As Quort overturns a desk and Hawkins scatters papers --

OUTSIDE -- CHURCHILL’S MOTORCYCLE

disappears into the night leaves skittering in its wake
AND WE DISSOLVE TO

EXT THE DARBY PUBLIC LIBRARY -- A CRISP AUTUMN DAY

Neo-gothic ivy climbing its walls Will stands with his
Mom who’s dropping him off her car idling nearby

SARAH
I’m not sure this is the time for me to
be going to a conference

WILL
Mom I’m sorry about what happened at
school -- but you’re supposed to give a

talk Austin’s Mom’s expecting me and
I’‘1ll be fine I’m not five any more

She gives him one of those ‘affectionate mom’ looks

SARAH
Tell me about it Just keep the drama to
a minimum okay

WILL
Always Mostly

As they smile
INT THE CAVERNOUS FRONT LOBBY -- AT THE FRONT DESK

Is MS CREEL squinting down her nose at Will holding a
Community Service Slip with his name on it

MS CREEL
More public service Shall we just put a
cot in the historical archives for you
(sniffing)
Although I suppose there is a recent
donation that needs sorting

Will’s not quite able to hide his smile
INT THE LIBRARY -- A BACK AREA
Ms Creel leads Will past stacks HEELS CLACKING

MS CREEL
If anything is missing you will be held
accountable If anything is damaged you
will be held accountable If anything --

WILL
-- is anything I know I’1l be held
accountable

Ms Creel glares at him as they round a corner to
THE ARCHIVE AREA

An arched window lets in filtered light BOOKS and
scrolls everywhere OLD NEWSPAPERS and artifacts He
takes it in a place he loves no matter how often he’s
here Ms Creel indicates boxes stacked by bookshelves

MS CREEL
Unpack them inventory them and try not
to take as long as you usually do
They’re to be organized not perused

She walks off Will looks at the boxes ‘Donated by the
Estate of Sebastian Meeker’

THE ARCHIVE AREA -- A MONTAGE

As Will carefully takes things from the boxes handling
them reverently in the way of someone who loves history

Magazines from the 30s and 40s’ 78s Newspapers
pulps And A CHILDREN’S BOOK Meeker’s NAME AND ADDRESS
written in a child’s hand on the frontispiece

And then A PHOTO of a young Meeker and a brass desk
plaque ‘Sebastian Meeker Chief Officer Bank of the
Chesapeake 1944’

And finally A BOOK Leatherbound ‘History of the
World Vol 7 Lost Treasures and Hidden Mysteries’ He
opens it reads in the frontispiece inscribed in an OLD
MAN’S TREMULOUS HAND ‘Property of the Meeker Estate’

Something’s stuck in the book’s pages AN ENVELOPE
slightly yellowed OLD Will slides it out It’s
addressed to ‘Sebastian Meeker Bank of Chesapeake’ No
return address but the postage stamp is German

He takes A LETTER from the envelope and as he unfolds it
-- SOMEONES THERE HE STARTLES seeing Austin and Lily

WILL
Aaaah What are you doing here

AUSTIN
Don’t worry Ms Creel’s deaf as a post
we snuck past her again

LILY
No way we’d let our best friend face her
alone
(checking out the magazines)
Cool

AUSTIN
(picking up some LPs)
What are these things

LILY
Records
(Austin stares dumbly)
For playing music From the old days

AUSTIN
Seriously Are they like Frisbees

LILY
Tell me you’re only pretending to be an
idiot -- because it’s totally working

AUSTIN
(reading a box)
Sebastian Meeker Who’s he

No answer from Will He’s just read the letter and he’s
staring at it disbelief mixed with excitement

LILY
Will What is it What’s wrong

Will doesn’t answer just slowly sits on a box stunned

LILY
Will

AUSTIN
Maybe he has a fever Do you have a
fever

WILL

It’s this letter I think I think
it’s about the lost Nazi treasure

AUSTIN
He does have a fever

Lily takes the letter and she and Austin read it

December 1944
Meeker
The package shall be delivered as scheduled

Kemp

LILY
(searching her memory)
Kemp How is it I remember

WILL
- that name I’ve only mentioned it a
hundred times The German my Dad found
in the Andes -- the supply Sergeant
named Jaeger -- had a manifest with the
names of the treasure convoy’s Captains
And one of the Captain’s was --

LILY
-—- Kemp

WILL
Gunthar Kemp Who Dad thought brought
his sub to the Chesapeake

LILY
- This can’t be the same guy
WILL
Why not Look Dad always said there had
to be someone who could convert the
treasure to money and Meeker was a
banker And this letter does refer to a
package -- which could mean a treasure

LILY
But why’d Meeker send all this stuff
here And why’s the letter in the book

AUSTIN
It’s not the only thing in the book

Austin’s looking at the LEATHERBOUND BOOK -- where
peeking out from a tear in the lining is A PHOTOGRAPH

A MOMENT LATER -- WILL HOLDS THE PHOTO

Austin and Lily beside him The photo’s brown-tinted
heavy cardboard with THREE MEN (a young Meeker young
Kemp and young Smith) posing stiffly side-by-side in
front of trees and a stone mansion Will points

WILL
That’s him Sebastian Meeker

AUSTIN
Who are the other two

WILL
Maybe one of them’s Kemp But you know
I think I recognize that building
(beat)
And I think it’s just outside of town

AT THE FRONT DESK

Ms Creel’s stamping books Will HURRIES PAST the
leatherbound book under his shirt

MS CREEL
Excuse me young man —-

WILL
Sorry gotta go dentist appointment

Lily and Austin SCURRY PAST as well

AUSTIN
Us too

MS CREEL
And who are you

As the kids exit Ms Creel sniffs

MS CREEL
Troublemakers

Passing the three kids as they exit is CHURCHILL -- who
gives them a glance as he heads to the front desk

CHURCHILL
Excuse me

Ms Creel keeps stamping

CHURCHILL
Excuse me

She holds up a finger stamps two more books then looks
at him Yes

CHURCHILL
I was wondering if you could help me
I’ve been researching local libraries and
their archival collections --

MS CREEL
I’m sorry but our collection is closed
to the public until some recent
inventorying has concluded

CHURCHILL
Oh that is such a disappointment
Couldn’t you make an exception
He gives her a smile An icicle glares back
MS CREEL
Absolutely not Under no circumstances
do we ever --

He takes her hand looks deeply into her eyes

CHURCHILL
Please Just this once

She stares
THE ARCHIVE AREA

Churchill is opening one of Meeker’s boxes Ms Creel
nearby her icy exterior melted

MS CREEL
Just let me know if you need anything

CHURCHILL
I will Emiline Thank you so much

A BELL DINGS from the front desk She gives him her
version of a seductive smile then reluctantly leaves
And as Churchill turns to the box --

AT THE FRONT DESK

Ms Creel approaches then slows -- seeing waiting
there QUORT AND HAWKINS

BACK IN THE ARCHIVE AREA -- AT THAT MOMENT
Churchill holding a book hears a DISTANT SCREAM
INT THE ENTRY HALL OF THE LIBRARY -- LATER

The sign on the front door has been turned to ‘Closed’
MS CREEL is BOUND AND GAGGED behind the desk

WHILE IN THE ARCHIVE AREA
Torrance with his hirelings surveys Meeker’s donation
TORRANCE
Tear it apart if you have to But find

out what he sent that’s so important

As they start A SOFT SOUND comes from the shadowed
bookshelves Torrance holds up a hand wait

AND A MOMENT LATER --

in the stacks where the sound came from QUORT APPEARS
He stops looks around Nothing here -- except
STRETCHED ON A SHELF just behind him trying as best he
can to look like books CHURCHILL

A moment Churchill scarcely breathing then

TORRANCE (0S)
Never mind

A beat and Quort moves

BACK TO THE ARCHIVE AREA

Where Torrance holds a book as Quort reappears the
CHILDREN’S BOOK Meeker’s name and address written ina

child’s handwriting on the inner cover

TORRANCE
We may have what we need

And as CHURCHILL PEERS OUT from the stacks

AUSTIN (PRELAP)
It’s Meeker’s childhood estate

THE OLD MEEKER MANSION -- DUSK

Foreboding decaying overgrown with ivy with gables
turrets walls charred from a long ago fire

At the foot of a driveway gone to weed Will holds up THE
TINTED PHOTO comparing it to the actual building --
Austin reading from the web page of an historical society
popped up on his i-phone Lily looking on

AUSTIN
He lived in it until just after the war
when there was a fire Moved because
every time he tried to repair it
something went wrong
(hesitating)
Rumors were it was cursed

Will heads to the mansion Lily following

AUSTIN
(after them)
You did hear that part didn’t you
About the curse

LILY
Man up

AUSTIN
Easy for you to say

INT MEEKER’S ESTATE -- A LARGE ENTRY HALL -- EVENING

Shadowy The kids enter pushing aside cobwebs Lily
pulling flashlights from her pack and handing them out

AUSTIN
Don’t tell me thats actually some sort
of Chinese Mary Poppins bag

They switch on the flashlights the beams picking up
cobwebs rotting timbers debris dust everywhere

AUSTIN
Spider

As he starts flailing Lily rolls her eyes -- then sees
something through a massive door that’s partly open

BEHIND THE DOOR -- THE KIDS MOVE IN

Austin with one last swat Seeing in shadowed evening
light lining the walls TOWERING BOOKSHELVES With as
many books on the floor as on the shelves most of them
mildewed but still unmistakably this is THE LIBRARY

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

FLASHLIGHTS play along the shelves Will pauses looks
at a book he’s holding the one from Meeker’s donation
Runs his hand along the spine

On it there are INDENTATIONS and IRREGULARITIES He
looks at the shelves eyes scanning then goes to

A ROW OF BOOKS ON A SHELF most of the books missing or
decayed but enough left to show that this is A SERIES
History of the World Vol 1-30 Will’s book is Volume 7

As Lily and Austin come over he moves aside books
seeing in the wall behind them INDENTATIONS

He hesitates then inserts his book into place A CLICK
and a panel in the back wall SLIDES SIDEWAYS Will
shines his flashlight into a DARK CAVITY

WILL
There’s something in there

AUSTIN
Most likely hairy big-toothed spiders

Will hesitates then reaches in probes the cavity --

AUSTIN
(can’t look)
That like to munch on fingers

-- and pulls out a BRONZE BOX elaborately carved very
old with a SERIES OF INTERLOCKING DIALS on it He tries
to open it but can’t SOMETHING RATTLES inside of it

WILL
It’s a puzzle box Impossible to open
without the right combination

AUSTIN
I’m excellent at puzzles Let me try

Austin takes the box and starts to fiddle as Will again
aims his beam at the cavity

WILL
There’s something else in there

AUSTIN
Nope it’s impossible

As Austin puts the puzzle box into the backpack Will
reaches -- and pulls out AN ANCIENT KEY one of the ones
the co-conspirators held decades ago As he does
SOMETHING HAPPENS

THE GOLDEN LOOP around Will’s neck begins to GLOW
FAINTLY as does THE KEY --

And from nowhere a WIND STIRS and then WHIRLS --
dust and scraps of paper dancing in it coming
toward them then AROUND THEM and as it does --

-- WITHIN THE WHIRLWIND A GHOSTLY IMAGE wavers --
of a YOUNGER MEEKER placing the key and the box
into the bookshelf -- an image that dissipates as
the GLOW AND THE WIND FADE -- but only after
MEEKER STARES AT WILL as if looking into his soul

The last paper settling the kids look at each other

AUSTIN
Did you

See that They nod Will looks at the key

WILL
I think I’ve seen this

LILY
Will

WILL
I know I have

LILY
Will

Will looks up Standing in the door to the library
TORRANCE his hirelings flanking him A beat as they all
stare at each other then Torrance holds out a hand

TORRANCE
May I

He wants the key

WILL
Who are you

TORRANCE
(ignoring the question)
Please If you don’t mind

WILL
No

Torrance nods and Hawkins moves quickly behind Will and
DIMPLES HIS NECK with the sharp point of a shirukin
FREEZING HIM A moment then

AUSTIN
I say give him a peek

Will carefully hands him the key Hawkins steps back and
Torrance turns the key over examining it

Austin nods and gives a little smile to Mira

AUSTIN
Hi

She just stares

TORRANCE
Interesting This is centuries old

WILL
More than two thousand years actually
Mesopotamian maybe Sumerian

Torrance looks at him Considers him

TORRANCE
Well A young historian
(indicating the backpack)
Now the rest

WILL
I don’t know what you’re talking about

TORRANCE
I believe you do Everything you have

Again he holds out a hand but Will doesn’t budge Their
eyes lock and hold -- the moment full of threat -- when

CRASH -- Churchill SMASHES IN through the window GLASS
SHATTERING shards flying Rolls POPS UP -- and after a
quick glance between he and Torrance of recognition --
he SHAKES OFF GLASS --

CHURCHILL
God I hate that

-- then turns to Will points at the backpack

CHURCHILL
Okay listen Give me whatever you have
and get the hell out of here You have
no idea what you’re in the middle of

Will looks back and forth caught between a rock and a
hard place as Torrance’s hirelings take a step forward
Lily can see where this is heading

LILY
(through her mouth aside)
On three

AUSTIN
(gets it)
Three Oh no please not thr --

LILY
Three

And she DIVES SLIDES SNATCHES THE KEY from Torrance
pops up -- A SHIRUKIN thrown by Hawkins THUNKING into the
wall next to her pinning her to it by her sleeve --

-- as Quort grabs Will by the shirt collar lifting him --
and Mira SWIPES at Austin her long nails SLICING THE
AIR barely missing him

AUSTIN
Wow

Will gasping gropes -- then GRABS A HEAVY BOOK from a
shelf BRINGS IT DOWN HARD on Quort’s head --

-- who staggers and drops Will bumps into a RUSTING SUIT
OF ARMOR overturning it into Hawkins who also staggers

as ANOTHER SWIPE of Mira’s SPARKS off the armor and Lily

pulls free from the wall --

-- and the kids CLATTER FROM THE HOUSE Hawkins Mira and
Quort taking off after them --

-- as Torrance GRABS A SWORD from the suit of armor
swings it at Churchill who GRABS A WINDOW STAY and
BLOCKS THE BLOW with a CLANG

TORRANCE
You have no business here

CHURCHILL
More than you do

CLANG Churchill barely blocks another strike -- and they
FENCE AND PARRY metal SPARKING Torrance the far better
fencer Churchill backing up --

CHURCHILL
Hey hold on a second Let’s talk about --

SPANG no let up and Churchill retreats into --
THE MAIN HALL

then backs up a grand staircase fending off strikes
Spang spang He’s completely out of his league

CHURCHILL
-- really let’s just talk about this

TORRANCE
There’s nothing to talk about

CHURCHILL
How about a truce A deal

TORRANCE swings barely missing Guess not They’re on
a balcony that overlooks the main hall Torrance
thrusts his blade jabbing just past Churchill’s ear

CHURCHILL
JUST A SECOND MAKE ME AN OFFER JUST
MAKE ME AN OFFER

Torrance pauses

TORRANCE
All right Does it matter who has the
Gate as long as it’s off your hands
Get it to me I’1ll make you rich I
promise I’1ll use it just once then I’11l
dispose of it properly And your
supposed Curse -- will be lifted

CHURCHILL
Not bad I’11 think about it

And CHURCHILL LEAPS OFF THE BALCONY grabs onto A
CHANDELIER Hangs there as it sways then JERKS drops a
few inches then DROPS TO THE FLOOR CRYSTAL SHATTERING

CHURCHILL
(staggering up)
Owww

THUNK The sword shivers in the floor next to him
thrown by Torrance

CHURCHILL
I said I’d think about it

And he flees out the window he came in

As Torrance stares after him Mira enters through the
front door She shakes her head at him No luck

TORRANCE
Find them find Churchill And I want to
know who the children are The boy
seemed familiar

And as Mira moves to start her task
EXT SOME BUSHES -- NIGHT

FEET POUND PAST Hawkins and Quort A moment and the
BUSHES RUSTLE The kids are hiding there

Austin carefully takes Will by the shoulders

AUSTIN
(very calmly)
All right I need you to listen to me
(shaking him)
What in God’s name is going on here

WILL
They’re clearly after the Gate And
somehow I recognize two of them
He sees the puzzle box peeking from Lily’s pack

WILL
Let’s find out what’s in that

He melts away Lily following Plaintively

AUSTIN
Will the madness never cease

EXT JAMES’S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- LATER
A faint glow comes from inside

WILL (0S)
It’s a lighthouse

INT JAMES’ OFFICE
Under an OLD-FASHIONED FLUOROSCOPE -- the type found

decades ago in shoe stores -- is the SHADOWY OUTLINE of a
DISTINCTIVE LIGHTHOUSE nestled inside the puzzle box
LILY
- That’s in a box Why

AUSTIN
Okay both of you We have a situation
Involving letters and keys and Loops and
scary people and weird winds and WHO
CARES ABOUT A LIGHTHOUSE

A moment then he looks at the fluoroscope realizing

AUSTIN
I’ve seen this before

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

The kids gather around a booted up computer Austin
working it On it a photo of ‘The Sorrel Bay
Lighthouse’ its outline matching the fluoroscope

WILL
Sorrel Bay Sure Look --

Will pulls from a pile A SCRAPBOOK of his Dad’s ‘The
Lost Treasure of The Chesapeake’ pages through it

WILL
It’s one of the spots where my Dad
thought the u-boat could have sunk

He stops on a map of the Chesapeake points at one of
several ‘X’s’ dotting it Sorrel Bay

WILL
And the key we found -- remember I said
Id seen it Well I had
(turning more pages)
On the parchment fragment my Dad found in
Egypt that shows part of the Gate

He stops on THE PARCHMENT we saw the Sage scribing so
long ago -- with half the parchment torn off right in
the middle of a drawing so that what we do see is

TWO MEN reacting in fear to THE HOLLOW PYRAMID made of
notched lines the GLOWING LOOP at its apex connected
what we don’t see the Gate on the missing half

Will takes THE KEY from the pack puts it beside the
pyramid It matches exactly one of the notched legs

WILL
It can’t be a coincidence That key’s

part of the Gate
(MORE )

to
WILL (CONTD)
Which means we’re on the trail of the

lost treasure
(beat)

And we need to go and find it

LILY

No Will there are people after us
Adults With guns and weapons

AUSTIN

Not to mention there are you know

glowing things

WILL

I don’t care This was my Dad’s last
quest Part of what pulled him to it was
that it was right in his back yard Not
in some distant place far away but
right here -- and I’m going to finish it
I’m going to prove he wasn’t crazy I’m
going to find that treasure

(his eyes shining)

And if I do -- we do -- you --

(indicating Lily)

-- you can get into any college you want
without worrying about paying for it

(to Austin)
And you You’ll be --

AUSTIN

-- rich Really really rich I’m in

Will hesitates then puts his hand out

WILL

So what do you say Here’s to finding
the treasure and Eternity’s Gate

A moment and Austin adds his hand
AUSTIN
(hopefully)
We’ll be rich
And Lily SIGHS shakes her head --

LILY
Trapped with fools

Then puts her hand on top of theirs

Then looks at Lily

The pact sealed

And after a moment of it all sinking in

LILY

But whatll we tell our parents
EXT A TRAIN -- NIGHT

Clacking past long grass bending

INT A TRAIN CAR

Austin’s on his phone working his magic

AUSTIN
Yes Mrs Chen your daughter’s fine but
Dr Myers wants us to spend the night to
assist her in some research that will
provide early college credit for your
lovely and talented child No she’s
not available nor the good doctor
either they’re preparing the chemicals --
no no not dangerous chemicals at all
that would be wrong wouldn’t it Hold
for a moment will you

He touches his phone

AUSTIN
Yes Mother I told you Dr Myers
cancelled her trip and we’re spending the
night No Mother Dr Myers is not
available right now she’s on a house
call Yes Mother doctors still do
house calls No Mother I do not need
underwear Hold on a second

He touches his phone
AUSTIN
Mrs Chen have I ever told you how
delicious your wontons are

AT THE FRONT OF THE CAR

Will is looking out the window Lily asleep near him
Austin flops down in the otherwise deserted car

AUSTIN
Handled Ginormous trouble eventually
but for now we’re good Night

He closes his eyes -- and as he does Will touches the
Loop around his neck thinking

AUSTIN
(shifting mumbling)
Be nice to know who’s after us though

And he’s asleep

Will looks out the window lost in dreams of his Dad and
adventure -- and as the landscape passes by

DISSOLVE TO
OUTSIDE JAMES’ DARKENED OFFICE -- NIGHT
A motorcycle parked in the shadows
IN THE OFFICE
Someone shines a flashlight around CHURCHILL His beam
plays across artifacts manuscripts books the jumble
that’s James’ office -- then STOPS on something on the
wall that’s partially blocked by books
A FRAMED PHOTO of THREE MEN at a train station ready to
disembark on an expedition -- James in the middle his
arms over the shoulders of CHURCHILL AND TORRANCE
Churchill sees THE COMPUTER still glowing with life
SCREENSAVER ON Moves to it Taps a key and UP POPS A
WEB SITE with TRAIN SCHEDULES on it He eyes it then --
HIS MOTORCYCLE -- IN TOWN -- LATER
Roars past the fisheye of an ATM -- as --
INT A HI-TECH ROOM -- SOMEWHERE

Mira is at a womb of monitors Torrance just entering

MIRA
Found him

On a monitor the same angle we saw above of Churchill
A COUNTRY ROAD -- LATER

Churchill thrums bent over handlebars his motorcycle
paralleling TRAIN TRACKS Far ahead heading away from
him is his goal WILL’S TRAIN

The tracks split from the road GOING DOWNWARD into a
gorge and as they do --

SPANG -- a BULLET CLIPS off a branch and startled
Churchill glances back sees HEADLIGHTS

THE PURSUING CAR -- IS TORRANCE’S LIMO

Quort driving intently Torrance in the back seat
Hawkins leaning out SQUEEZING OFF another shot

CHURCHILL DUCKS

sees ahead approaching AN OLD BRIDGE a slight natural
rise next to it -- and he also sees --

BELOW THE BRIDGE
the train approaching it
CHURCHILL

fights for control as a bullet SPARKS off his cycle then
decides Only one way out

He revs it -- and as a BULLET BLOWS HIS REAR TIRE he
FLIES OFF THE RISE by the bridge --

AS BEHIND
Torrance sees this as --
CHURCHILL PINWHEELS

his cycle SLAMMING into the opposite wall EXPLODING INTO
FLAMES -- Churchill LANDING HARD on top of the train --

AS INSIDE THE TRAIN

All three kids asleep Will is JOLTED AWAKE by A THUMP on
the roof at the far end of the car --

WHILE ON THE TOP OF THE TRAIN

Churchill scrabbles slides GRABS DESPERATELY the edge
of the roof hangs on and as the train rounds a bend

ABOVE -- ON THE BRIDGE

Torrance’s limo SKIDS TO A STOP and Torrance gets out
Looks at the motorcycle as it EXPLODES into a shower of
flame -- and then at THE TRAIN RECEDING into the
distance And as his eyes narrow and BEHIND HIM in the
sky A HELICOPTER approaches and descends --

INSIDE THE TRAIN

Will walks cautiously through the car heading toward
where he heard the thump

At the end of the car he carefully slides open the
dividing door and enters --

THE COUPLING PLATFORM
train CLACKING tracks whizzing by

Takes only a couple of steps when the door to the outside
is KICKED OPEN Churchill hanging there legs scissoring

CHURCHILL
Help

Will just stares Churchill’s hand slips regrips wind
blowing against him trees whizzing past

CHURCHILL
Please

Will reaches grabs Churchill by the belt pulls him in
Churchill collapsing flat on his back

CHURCHILL
Thanks

WILL
What are you doing here

Churchill holds up a weary hand
CHURCHILL
Relax kid I come in peace Pieces more

like it Name’s Thomas Churchill

He struggles painfully to a sitting position

CHURCHILL

You wouldn’t have any Advil would you
WILL

How did you --
CHURCHILL

Find you Not as easily as I would have
liked I can promise you that God it
hurts to land on top of a train Here

Churchill holds out the photo that was in James’ office

CHURCHILL
I was in the Andes with your father

Will looks at the photo realizes

WILL
That’s where I’ve seen you This was in --

(his expression darkening)
(MORE )

WILL (CONTD)
-- in my Dad’s office You were in my
Dads office

CHURCHILL

Guilty as charged Looking for you
Because you’ve got what I need and
because you can still get out of this
mess -- something that I can’t do given
that Meeker was my Uncle

(off Will’s look)
Yeah my Uncle Who brought the Curse on
our family because he brought the Gate
here You’ve got to know about the Curse
-- your Dad said he told you everything

Churchill prods a spot on his back and WINCES

CHURCHILL
So here’s the deal The only way for me
to get rid of the Curse is to find the
Gate and all of its parts and get rid of
them -- bury them where they can’t be
found But since I don’t know where it
all is you need to give me everything

you have and get out of my way -- let me
find it so I can finally be free And if
you don’t -- if you keep sticking your

nose where it shouldn’t be Assuming
that guy doesn’t get you --

(indicating Torrance’s image
-- eventually the Curse will Because
sooner or later no matter what you do
no matter how hard you try that Curse
always jumps out and bites you right in
the

He trails off stops Because Will has an odd expression
on his face something strange is happening behind him

Churchill slowly turns the SOUND OF A HELICOPTER
filtering in and sees just DROPPING INTO VIEW hanging
by a harness HAWKINS --

-- who gains a purchase on the platform -- spots Will as
he STRIKES with A DAGGER --

-- CHURCHILL DODGING then DIVING wrapping around
Hawkins and penduluming off the train -- catching Will’s
eye as he does --

CHURCHILL
Damn Curse

-- then rising from view as Lily and Austin BURST IN

LILY
What’s going on We heard a helicopter

Will doesn’t answer Just sees THE PHOTO Churchill
showed him flapping away in the wind

OUTSIDE -- A HELICOPTER

-- the same one we saw earlier descending from the sky --
flies over a moonlit landscape Hawkins and Churchill
dangling from it Churchill holds on for dear life legs
wrapped around Hawkins one hand tight on the rope the
other fighting off the dagger

CHURCHILL
Ever hear about a thing called deodorant

HAWKINS
Shut up

With his free hand Hawkins CLUBS CHURCHILL on the side
of the head -- who slips nearly loses his grip seeing

BELOW HIM --

a dizzying view of trees and at the edge of his vision
a river passing by

AND ABOVE -- IN THE CHOPPER -- QUORT
who pulls the rope up hand-over-hand Mira piloting
WHILE HAWKINS --

pushes the dagger closer and closer to Churchill’s face
despite Churchill’s efforts

CHURCHILL
(straining)
What say we just grab a beer
HAWKINS

Always talking Give me your tongue so I
can cut it out

Beat

CHURCHILL
Okay

And he LICKS HAWKINS’ CHEEK Hawkins RECOILS shoves
Churchill away --

-- and Churchill PLUMMETS falling -- pinwheeling --

-- finally SPLASHING into the river far below
WHILE ABOVE -- IN THE CHOPPER

Hawkins climbs in as Quort and Mira see nothing but a
ripple in the river where Churchill disappeared --

And as Mira angles the CHOPPER off into the night
INT THE TRAIN CAR -- THE KIDS GATHERED
Austin’s been doing research on his phone

AUSTIN
Okay -- Churchill Thomas L Parents
died when he was a baby lived with his --

(with significance)

-- uncle Sebastian Meeker for a while --
(continuing)
-- until he was kicked out of three prep
schools claimed he was framed every
time that he was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time Then he sort of
bounced around the fringes skippered a
boat in the Bahamas that sunk had
several scrapes with the law freelanced
here and there but nothing really stuck --
basically was a really unlucky guy --
kind of a theme with his family Other
than that I got nothing

LILY
- You terrify me

AUSTIN
Thank you Seems to me the only reason a
guy like that’d want the treasure is for
no good Right Will
Will doesn’t say anything to contradict Austin --
AS WE CUT TO
INT A PACKED BAR -- NIGHT

The CAMERA MOVING through the crowd toward a booth a
typical bar band playing typical bar band music --

-- FINDING CHURCHILL still dripping from his little dip

in the river Drinking from a pitcher of beer brooding
an ATTRACTIVE DRUNK WOMAN draped all over him sweet if a
bit clueless

THE WOMAN
Aren’t you the cutest thing

CHURCHILL
Have you ever really wanted something
but the closer you get to it the more
trouble it gives you

THE WOMAN
Sweetie the closer you get to me I’11l
give you all the trouble you want

CHURCHILL
You want to hear a story

THE WOMAN
A bedtime story

CHURCHILL
It starts in China 3000 years ago

THE WOMAN
It is a bedtime story

CHURCHILL
There’s this artifact Got some special
powers It first showed up somewhere
around the Shan Dynasty

As Churchill talks we’ll see WASHED-OUT SCENES
illustrating his words starting with

A WARLORD in a tent with the wind whipping SOMETHING
GLOWING BRILLIANTLY as he peers at it the glow growing
to swallow him

CHURCHILL (VO)
-- when a Warlord used it to find the
secret of an enemy’s attack plan winning
a kingdom

There is a great battle THE WARLORD RAISING HIS SWORD in
victory

CHURCHILL (VO)
But afterwards he was struck blind

The Warlord CROUCHES IN AGONY BLOOD coming from his
eyes

NOW Arabians ride horses across the desert at night
their robes flapping led by a BANDIT KING
CHURCHILL (VO)
And in Sumeria around 300 BC there’s
the legend of a Bandit King

THE ARABIANS have their horses reigned to a stop in front
of the GAPING MAW OF A CAVE

A QUICK FLASH of the Warlord in his tent

CHURCHILL (VO)
- who used it to find a fortune buried
a thousand years before

SOMETHING GLOWING

THEN torches lit
forward into a chamber in the cave

JEWELS confront them

CHURCHILL (VO)
But he went mad after his family died in
a plague

As the Bandit King cradles his family in grief

CHURCHILLS FACE

Churchill

CHURCHILL
You see the theme here Own it you get
screwed Or in my case because my Uncle
brought it here even though I did
nothing wrong --

SLAMS down his beer

CHURCHILL
-- my life’s a big pile of crap

THE WOMAN
This isn’t a happy story is it

CHURCHILL
See his Curse was to have it spread to
his family Which means everywhere I
turn no matter what I do something bad
always happens Not always right away --
sometimes I’m just sort of toyed with
made to think everything’s okay -- but
then wham -- it always comes crashing
down Like now -- I’m this close to my
ticket out of the Hell that’s my
existence but I just can’t close the
deal And you know why

squinting at

the Bandit King and his men press
where GLITTERING

Suddenly A HAND grabs Churchill WHIRLS HIM A hand
belonging to the woman’s HUGE AND PISSED-OFF BOYFRIEND

THE BOYFRIEND
The only deal you’re closing is your face
at the end of my arm

CHURCHILL
Damn Curse

As a FIST IMPACTS Churchill --

EXT A YACHT -- NIGHT

A party in progress spilling across the whole boat
dancing beautiful people caviar Mira pilots the
helicopter to a settled landing on the deck

INT AN ELEGANT STATEROOM

The sounds of the party are muffled here Art antiques
dot the room Torrance with controlled anger gestures

TORRANCE
This caviar -- only comes from one tiny
village in Russia This beef From one
herd in the mountains of Japan All of
this --
(he sweeps the room)
-- one of a kind Unique And I could
get them But this one little thing --
why is it so difficult
HAWKINS
(a moment of hesitation)
Well

Torrance casts an icy gaze on Hawkins who clams up

TORRANCE
Churchill yes he’s always been a wild
card -- but three children One of them

I come to find out the son of a man who
was nothing to me Who you now tell me
was on the same train with Churchill

Mira punches a button and a CLEAR MAP of the Chesapeake
DROPS with train tracks and glowing dots overlaid

MIRA
These are the towns the train services

TORRANCE
Then you know where to look Find them
I want that Gate Can you imagine
Bluebeard’s lost treasure -- the missing
gold mines of King Solomon -- all mine

Torrance stalks to a door opens it TWO GIRLS WAITING on
the other side the party in full swing Looks back --

TORRANCE

And once you do find them do whatever it
takes to get that Gate Whatever it
takes Understood I will not be
stopped By anyone

This hangs and he leaves

EXT A DEPOT -- DAY

The train pulling to a stop STEAM HISSING

INSIDE THE TRAIN

Austin sleeps Lily shakes him

LILY
Wake up we’re here

AUSTIN
No more chocolate Beyonce I’1ll have
champagne instead

Lily disgustedly WHAPS him

AUSTIN
(snapping awake)
What

A LIGHTHOUSE PERCHES ON A PROMONTORY

overlooking the Chesapeake Bay Boarded up paint
peeling under the slate gray of an overcast sky the
Sorrel Bay Lighthouse The kids stand looking at it

INT THE LIGHTHOUSE

The door is SHOVED OPEN light slanting in through dust --
followed by the kids who AIM FLASHLIGHTS picking up a
hollow interior debris on the ground rotting timber

WILL
This was built in the late 1800s Closed
down about 20 years ago

AUSTIN
Man it stinks in here

Their beams shift to the curve of STAIRS winding upward
against the inner core

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

They climb the stairs loose chunks of dirt falling from
under their feet Lily’s flashlight plays above She
seems to see something

LILY
Am I crazy or are the walls moving

There does seems to be A RIPPLING in the blackness above
And then a SOFT CHITTERING Will notes white splotches
on the walls touches it

WILL
Guys
(sniffing it)
This is guano

AUSTIN
As in poop

WILL
From bats

Again they play their light upwards Seeing now that the
wall is a SOLID MASS OF RESTLESS BATS A beat

AUSTIN
(whispering)
I say we be really really quiet

He takes a steps backwards -- and his foot nudges a LARGE
CLOD OF DIRT That drops FALLS Hits the ground
below SPOOM

They all freeze A RUSTLING comes from above a
disturbance in the force that seems to settle But then

THE WALLS ERUPT into A STORM OF BATS That FLURRY around
the kids a rage of wings -- Lily almost knocked off the
stairs Will grabbing her

AUSTIN
Cover your ears

Amidst the chaos Austin is bent over his i-phone He
presses a button and as they do AN EAR-PIERCING WHINE
splits the air coming from the phone

The bats SQUEAL RECOIL stream through cracks in the
walls emptying the place

The last bat flaps out as Austin punches off his phone
They stand in the silence then look up to what awaits
them at the top

INT THE LAMP ROOM -- ATOP THE LIGHTHOUSE

The kids step into this dusty chamber over a few fallen
boards The cracked windows give a breathtaking 360
degree view of the surrounding landscape and the choppy
bay gray under the overcast skies

At the center of the room is the ROTATING LIGHTHOUSE
LAMP rust eating away at its carriage On its side is a
power console dusty long-idle

Will moves to a DUSTY PLAQUE on the wall Wipes it off
with his sleeve staring at the top revealing WRITING

A funny expression comes over his face -- he’s realized
something -- and as we read J WILTS MEMORIAL LIGHTHOUSE
he continues wiping explaining something

WILL
You know every lighthouse has a name --
but they also have an official
designation Denoted by its coordinates

And now revealed are numbers 37 30 13 76 16 56
WILL
Specifically by its latitude and
longitude

Will looks at his friends He’s just solved the riddle
of how to open the box

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Will has taken the Puzzle Box out of his backpack He
TURNS THE DIALS to match the numbers on the plaque The
last dial CLICKS into place -- and the box POPS OPEN

Nestled in it is a MINIATURE REPLICA LIGHTHOUSE As Will
takes it out

AUSTIN
There’s nothing else in there No note
no map

WILL

Just this
44

He points On the miniature lighthouse there’s A YELLOW
DOT painted at the top where the light might come out

Will places the lighthouse on a counter lines it up with
the real lighthouse The YELLOW DOT POINTS TO THE BAY

A MOMENT LATER

The three are straining to TURN THE CENTRAL LIGHTHOUSE
LAMP which groans under years of disuse It gives way
and slides into place the lamp pointing toward the bay
the same direction as the miniature lighthouse

Will moves to a power console Is preparing to push the
power lever down Lily notes something

LILY
Will

She indicates a gap in the power housing Tangled wires
are revealed some of the insulation frayed

LILY
It might not be safe

WILL
(after a beat)
We haven’t got a choice

He looks at his friends then pulls down the power
switch And from somewhere within the bowels of the
lighthouse there’s A WHINE revving up fluctuating --

-- and the lamp FLICKERS gives out then COMES UP AGAIN
as the hum GROWS IN INTENSITY the light growing

Then SPARKS come from the housing -- the three ducking --
and the THE LAMP FLARES into a BLINDING BEAM --

-- and the beam PIERCES THE MISTY OVERCAST outside --

-- ARROWING TO A CIRCLE OF LIGHT on the bay right in the
middle of a jagged semi-circle of rocks

The kids STARE AT THE SPOT then at each other -- could
this be it -- where the sub is

-- and then THE HOUSING EXPLODES into a SHOWER OF SPARKS
and smoke and the place goes black Through the gloom

AUSTIN
What now

WILL
We find out if it’s down there

EXT A DOCKSIDE PUB -- ‘THE RUSTY SCOW’ -- AFTERNOON

Fog drapes the streets a FOGHORN MOANS shadowy figures
drift in and out of alleys on business best left unasked

AUSTIN (0S)
Relax This is the kind of place you
come to if you need something

INT THE PUB

Packed noisy filled with wharf rats shady characters --
drinking laughing BETTING ON DARTS some on furtive
business The kids are at the door Will and Lily wary

AUSTIN
In fact my Uncle owned one of these

LILY
Figures

Austin surveys the crowd zeroes in on a glowering EYE-
PATCHED MAN at a corner booth who the crowd studiously
avoids as he drinks a beer TELFAIR Austin
instinctively knows this is his man

A MOMENT LATER
The kids approach the booth even Austin a bit tentative

AUSTIN
Excuse me sir do you have a moment

Telfair SLAMS his empty glass down and GLARES at them
Austin shakily signals A WAITRESS

AUSTIN
Garconette Four beers please

WAITRESS
(in a foghorn voice)
You have got to be kidding

AUSTIN
Not for us For him

A BIT LATER
Telfair is draining the last of the four beers the kids

watching with awe He slams the final glass down wipes
his mouth then looks at them well
AUSTIN
We need some supplies Top secret
And fast

Telfair hesitates then lets out A LONG RUMBLING BURP
that ruffles Austin’s hair A beat

AUSTIN
Assuming you can get them

TELFAIR
Nothing I can’t get But it’1l cost you
A lot

AUSTIN

No problem We have money

WILL
(into Austin’s ear)
No we don’t

There’s a CHEER near them A BURLY GUY collects a wad of

money having just won his umpteenth game of darts

AUSTIN
Well get money

THE BURLY GUY
Anyone else think they can take me on

AUSTIN
She’1ll do it

All eyes turn to them and Austin angles a thumb at Lily

A beat and the place ERUPTS into RAUCOUS LAUGHTER

THE BURLY GUY
Her A girl Try to beat me

Lily’s expression darkens there’s a thunderstorm coming

and you do not want to be there

THE BURLY GUY
A little girl An itty bitty teeny
weeny frilly willy little girl Hawww

If Lily were a bomb she’d be just about to explode
AUSTIN

You my friend have just unleashed the
dogs of Hell

A DART

Imbedding in the bulls-eye A CHEER from the crowd
AND LILY dances in triumph arms raised a la Rocky

LILY
That’s right Who’s the champ who’s the
champ you giant wiant tub of blubber

Austin collects money from the chastened Burly Guy

AUSTIN
Anyone else Line up one at a time

LILY
(as they do)
Behind my back this time
And as the crowd CHEERS AGAIN
EXT THE DOCKS -- NEAR A WAREHOUSE
Water laps under a pier fog still thick Will and Lily
watch as Austin hands money to Telfair a pile of

equipment in a tied-up boat nearby

AUSTIN
Pleasure doing business with you

TELFAIR
Tell anyone and I’1l slit your throat

AUSTIN
No need for a receipt then

LATER
The boat putts out onto the bay Telfair watching
As the kids are swallowed by the fog Telfair moves to a
pay phone -- probably the last one left in America -- and
dials
Someone answers on the other end
TELFAIR
You know them people you were looking

for I’ve spotted them Sheepshead Bay

From the mist behind Telfair A FIGURE LOOMS Grabs him
spins him SWINGS decking him knocking him unconscious

The figure listens to the receiver for a moment it’s
CHURCHILL

TORRANCE
(from the phone)
Hello

CROSSCUT TO THE OTHER END OF THE PHONE
And Torrance on his yacht Who senses who it is

TORRANCE
Churchill Is that you If it is
the offer still stands

A moment as Churchill considers then
AN UNDERWATER POV
Of fish and kelp

AUSTIN (0S)
Do you read me do you read me Blue Dog
Down Is all well

ABOVE -- ON THE BAY

In the shelter of rocks picked out by the lighthouse
beam bobbing in the gray of thick fog are Austin and
Lily on the motorboat seeing on A VIDEO MONITOR the same
view as above -- as well as a SONAR DOT tracking Will’s
progress along a topographic map

AUSTIN
(into his headset)
I repeat Blue Dog Down is all well Is
all well

Lily’s had it She RIPS the headset off of him

LILY
No human on Earth should have to put up
with you in their head
(putting it on)
You okay
AUSTIN
(reaching for the headset)
Give it back

LILY
Get your hands off

As they scuffle for it

BELOW -- WILL

in a wetsuit and SCUBA gear swims along the bottom a
pinhole camera imbedded in his facemask

WILL
I don’t see anything yet

CROSSCUT WITH ABOVE

AUSTIN
(fast into Lily’s
mouthpiece)
There’s a channel around the big rocks to
your right

He sticks his tongue out at Lily who shakes her head as

BELOW Will kicks around the rocks Ahead SOMETHING
HUGE LOOMS covered in sand and silt He kicks toward
it

WILL
There’s something here

Will swims right up to it Takes a hand and wipes mud
away from a surface Revealing a painted if rusting
inscription U-231

And we see the whole thing now the SUNKEN U-BOAT a
JAGGED HOLE gashed into one side The import of this is
not lost on all three kids

LILY
(from the radio)
- You were right Will

WILL
(quietly)
My Dad was right

After a moment
ABOVE -- Austin SPLASHES A CANVASS BAG overboard

AUSTIN
It’s time to bring this puppy up Tell
him the baby is coming to the crib
Repeat the baby is coming to the crib

LILY
(into her headpiece very
deliberately)
The idiot has dropped the package

BELOW -- THE CANVASS BAG

has settled near the sub Will swims up to it zips it
open revealing folded white canvass material

ABOVE -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Will breaks the surface

AND A LITTLE AFTER THAT -- ON THE BOAT

The three kids huddle around the monitor seeing the sub
from a camera Will’s left behind Will has changed from

his wetsuit back into street clothes

Will looks at the other two then PUSHES A BUTTON on a
remote

BELOW
Along the length of the u-boat are long white canvass
tubes what was in bag A BURST from each and from

condensed air cannisters the TUBES INFLATE

And AMID A STORM OF BUBBLES the sub shifts and groans
and begins to pull free from the bottom

ABOVE -- THROUGH THE FOG
Surrounded by the jagged rocks that brought it down
dramatically the sub slowly BURSTS TO THE SURFACE the

kids watching as it settles water streaming off of it --

-- then it floats there moss hanging the past come
alive A moment as they take it in and

EXT THE U-BOAT -- LATER
The kid’s boat nestles against it as
INSIDE THE U-BOAT -- A SKELETON

in a Nazi uniform peers at us A FLASHLIGHT playing
across its hollow eyes

AUSTIN (0S)
Gross

REVEAL INT THE SUB -- THE CONTROL ROOM

Dark dripping the kids passing uniformed skeletons
flashlights casting shifting shadows

WILL
I know the floor plan of these boats
Cargo hold’s this way -- cargo’s ‘gebiihr’
in German That’s where the treasure
will be

Austin passes a staring skeleton

AUSTIN
Hey I’m going to be really rich

A DOORWAY

On it a plaque Kapitan Gunthar Kemp WILL pushes it
open peering in as his flashlight plays across the room
A UNIFORMED SKELETON leans against a wall in a Captain’s
uniform GUNTHAR KEMP -- or what’s left of him Will
studies him for a second then

LILY
Will

She’s moved down the hall where she stands in front of
another door marked Gebiihr Cargo

A MOMENT LATER

The three stand there Will about to open the door
Hesitating Knowing what a big moment this is

AUSTIN
(very quietly)
Really really rich

Will opens the door It squeaks from years of non-use
He aims his flashlight and sees that --

THE CARGO HOLD
Is empty Nothing here but metal walls

AUSTIN
-- Or not

As they move in Will’s face reflects his disappointment
WILL
It can’t be My Dad couldn’t have been
wrong

Lily puts a comforting hand on his shoulder

AUSTIN
Guys

Austin’s flashlight has picked up a sparkle in a corner
Will goes over to it picks up A RUBIED BRACELET And
he understands

WILL
The treasure was here But it was
unloaded -- before the sub sank
LILY

- So where is it
INT THE CAPTAIN’S CABIN
As the three kids enter

WILL
Look around Maybe we can find a clue

LILY
After all this time and all this water

WILL
We have to try

Austin holds up a ledger pulpy dripping He doubts
it’ll work But Lily’s seen something

LILY
Will

She points To WILLS NECK where there’s a FAINT GLOW
coming from under his collar

He pulls the necklace from under his shirt revealing THE
LOOP which is GLOWING SLIGHTLY It seems to TUG
A BIT -- toward a wall toward a crooked and decayed
painting -- then settle and fade

A moment and Lily removes the painting Revealing A
WALL SAFE

Austin CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES

AUSTIN
Allow me

LILY
Don’t tell me Another relative

AUSTIN
The internet

A POV -- FROM INSIDE THE SAFE

As it’s opened revealing the kids peering in A
FLASHLIGHT momentarily BLINDS US as

WILL

shines his flashlight into the safe Sees something

As he reaches in to retrieve it the Loop begins to
GLOW AGAIN -- brighter than before even brighter
as he pulls out AN ANCIENT KEY identical to the
key found before

The new key STARTS TO GLOW -- and the FIRST ONE
DOES TOO visible through the lining of the
backpack --

-- AND THEN A WIND stirs from nowhere WHIRLING
around the skeleton

And as it does THE SKELETON FILLS OUT becoming a

person -- becoming Captain Kemp -- flesh covering
his bones then stripping away then appearing
again -- as he REACHES OUT toward the kids

GRASPING the kids shying away --

-- until the wind and the glow fade the skeleton
becoming only bones then DISSOLVING INTO DUST --

-- as A RING that was on Kemp’s finger CLINKS TO THE
FLOOR and rolls to a stop at Will’s feet

Austin and Lily are unaware that they’re hugging each
other -- until Lily realizes what she’s doing and SHOVES
AUSTIN away Ewww

Will picks up the ring eyes it and then all three kids
look at each other What are we dealing with Then

CHURCHILL
Play time’s over

Churchill’s at the hatch holding a gun on them
CHURCHILL
Time to let the big boys handle this
Give
They stare He motions
CHURCHILL

Everything now I’m tired of messing
around with a bunch of kids

WILL
How did --

CHURCHILL
I find you Around here everyone knows
Telfair’s the guy to go to Everyone
So hand it over You have three seconds

WILL
Or you’ll shoot us

CHURCHILL
Yes In the head Come on come on
Before it’s --

There’s a BUMP up above Beat

CHURCHILL
-- too late

Churchill throws his hands up in frustration
CHURCHILL
Of course it’s too late Damned Curse
Stupid kids
He stalks out Beat

AUSTIN
Curse

Churchill sticks his head back in

CHURCHILL
Move it Now

OUTSIDE -- TORRANCE’S YACHT

floats Torrance silhouetted looking at

THE U-BOAT

where a launch is moored Hawkins Quort and Mira just
climbing off of it -- but stopping hearing THE PUTTER OF
A BOAT heading away -- and seeing

WILL AND THE OTHERS -- IN THEIR BOAT

Churchill steering through rocks toward shore Will

HOLDS THE REMOTE he used to inflate the bladders
Punches a button

AND ON THE U-BOAT

the attached bladders BURST And the deck jolts bubbles
streaming from below the deck tilting

Hawkins Quort and Mira scramble back onto their launch as
the sub starts to sink --

WHILE ON SHORE

Will Churchill and the others scramble off the boat as
it slides onto the beach Near them is the very dock we
saw Meeker and his co-conspirators on during the War

As they look back to see Mira piloting her launch back
toward the yacht -- Austin SNATCHES THE GUN from
Churchill’s belt --

AUSTIN
HAH

-- and aims it at Churchill dancing around
AUSTIN
Who’s on top now buster -- huh who’s

the man now

CHURCHILL
Put the gun down

AUSTIN
Not until we get answers

LILY
Austin put the gun --

POW The gun GOES OFF the bullet flying off harmlessly

AUSTIN
(dropping the gun like a hot
potato)
Yow
LILY
-- down

She carefully picks the gun up then

LILY
(calmly to Churchill)
Now could you please tell us who owns
that yacht before --
(yelling at Austin)
-- SOMEBODY GETS HURT

CHURCHILL
Alexander Torrance Made millions in dot
com What he wants he gets and right
now he wants the Gate Which means we’re
in big trouble if we don’t get to my car--

Which is parked on a side road Will sees something

CHURCHILL
-- and get out of here

Churchill TRAILS OFF -- as he sees what Will sees
streaking from the yacht A HANDHELD MISSILE fired by
Quort who holds a missile launcher like it’s a toy --

AND THEY DIVE -- the missile HITTING THE CAR EXPLODING
IT into a shower of flame metal and debris

Churchill raises up peers at it

CHURCHILL
- Damn Curse

AUSTIN
(to Will)
Might be a good time to tell us a little
bit more about that Curse thing

WILL
Every ancient artifact has one

LILY
And you didn’t mention it because

Before they can pursue it further

CHURCHILL
Time for Plan B

Churchill scrambles to his feet because steaming toward
the dock almost at it is Torrance’s yacht

WILL
Which is

A BULLET ZINGS THE DIRT near them fired from the yacht

CHURCHILL
Run

IN UNDERGROWTH EDGING THE BEACH

The four of them run frantically pushing aside branches
almost tripping on roots finally breaking through into

A CLEARING

where LONG-UNUSED RAILROAD TRACKS stretch off amidst
WWII vintage abandoned and rusting equipment

WILL
(gets it)

These tracks -- must have been how the

treasure was unloaded way back when
They see back at the bay
TORRANCE’S YACHT
Touching the dock And as it does FLYING OFF OF IT
speeding toward them a STATE-OF-THE ART ATV Hawkins
driving Mira behind him

BACK IN THE CLEARING

Churchill looks around Spots AN OLD PUMP RAILCART on
the tracks

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

They’re on the railcart pumping the handle up and down
their efforts and a slight downslope building up speed

AUSTIN
(sees something)
I think we need to go faster

The ATV BOUNDS into view and races toward them
The four PUMP FRANTICALLY gaining more speed but not
enough as the ATV pulls alongside Hawkins LEVELLING A
PISTOL -- the moment frozen --
-- but the ATV HITS A RISE Hawkins’ gun flying off --

-- Mira LAUNCHING HERSELF onto the railcart wrapping
onto a surprised Austin from behind --

-- Hawkins WHIPPING A BOLO ROPE around Will’s ankle
pulling him toward the edge

The CART GOING FASTER now the downgrade even steeper

Austin flails and Churchill pries Mira loose and she
crouches glares at Churchill

CHURCHILL
Love what you’ve done with your hair

She SWIPES her nails cutting Churchill’s forearm

CHURCHILL
Not so much your nails

Lily pulls a METAL PIPE free FLINGS IT at Hawkins
giving Will a momentary reprieve But

WILL
That was the brake

There’s A DROP-OFF ahead the rusted tracks deteriorated

Churchill GRABS MIRA tosses her onto THE PUMP HANDLE
which SPRINGBOARDS HER back onto the ATV --

-- the impact JARRING HAWKINS freeing Will --

-- just as the railcart and the ATV HIT THE DROP-OFF and
PLUNGE DOWN IT wildly out of control -- the ATV CRASHING
at the bottom of the slope Mira and Hawkins flying --

-- THE RAILCART PLOWING through woods mowing down small
trees miraculously missing others --

Then emerging onto A BLACKTOPPED ROAD -- passing a
PUZZLED DRIVER Austin shrugging at him --

Then rolling down an off-ramp into a parking lot
settling to a stop at the DRIVE-THRU SPEAKER of a
McDonalds

FROM THE SPEAKER
May I help you

AUSTIN
--- I could use a Big Mac

CHURCHILL
We need to get out of sight I’ve gota
safe house nearby
(off Will’s look a safe
house
I’ve been here a lot

WILL
(understands )
Looking for the treasure

CHURCHILL
Only way to end the damn curse

EXT AN ALLEY -- NIGHT

A BUCKET OF FOOD SCRAPS is tossed out of the back door of
a bustling Chinese restaurant

ABOVE IT -- IS CHURCHILL’S APARTMENT -- A CONVERTED LOFT
Churchill snapping a curtain shut

CHURCHILL
Keep watch

LILY
I thought you said this place was safe

Churchill pulls out a Tequila bottle and a shot glass

CHURCHILL
It was until you got involved Now there
are three more people for Torrance to
track I tried to keep you out of it

Churchill stalks to a couch sits his back to them
pours himself a shot downs it

AUSTIN
What now

Will is staring at Churchill slightly distracted
something else on his mind

WILL
The treasure was taken somewhere We
just need to find out where

AUSTIN
How

Will doesn’t answer just heads to Churchill
AUSTIN

(after him)
Never mind

(to Lily)
Been nice if he’d’ve told us about the
Curse
LILY
He was afraid if he did we wouldn’t help
him
AUSTIN

Still should have told us

And as Austin notices CHURCHILL’S JACKET hanging on a
chair

AT THE COUCH -- WILL ARRIVES

and stands there staring at Churchill as Churchill pours
himself another shot

WILL
What happened -- in the Andes The night
my Dad you know

CHURCHILL

Don’t dwell on the past kid It’1l only
make you crazy

WILL
Tell me

Churchill downs the shot Then
A FLASHBACK

As if we’re watching fragments of documentary footage
First we see A CRUMBLING STONE CHURCH abandoned
surrounded by peaked mountains

CHURCHILL (0S)
After a stash of German treasure was
found in a church

THEN A CRUMBLED BASEMENT WALL with jewels behind it

CHURCHILL (0S)

-- your Dad mounted an expedition to
find out how it got there Hoping it
would lead to evidence about the lost u-
boat

THE EXPEDITION SMILES AND MUGS for the camera some of
them students some of them natives prominent James
between Churchill and Torrance

CHURCHILL (0S)
Torrance financed it and I signed on as a
guide Turns out all of us had our own
agendas

(beat)
But your Dad got suspicious of Torrance

TORRANCE is talking furtively with Quort and Hawkins
CHURCHILL (0S)
So when he found church records
indicating a German joined the priesthood
after the war and was still alive

James is going through old church records
CHURCHILL (0S)
--- he snuck off to find him keeping it
to himself
A CLOSE up of Torrance like he’s seen something OC

CHURCHILL (0S)
Or he thought he did

Then James looking at us SMILING
CHURCHILL (0S)
The last I saw him he was running from
Torrance’s men into a blizzard
NOW -- IN THE APARTMENT

Will silent for a moment

WILL
Did Torrance kill him

CHURCHILL
I don’t know At the end of the day
though it wasn’t someone It was some
thing The Gate

WILL
But my Dad wanted it -- for a museum
For good

CHURCHILL
Doesn’t matter The Gate gets you no
matter what your reason is -- different
ways for different people Me because
my Uncle’s Curse was to see his family
suffer Kemp he ended up at the bottom
of the ocean And your Dad

He trails off
CHURCHILL
Finding the Gate won’t bring him back

you know

They study each other -- when

AUSTIN
Hey
Austin STALKS UP thrusts out TWO IDENTICAL RINGS -- one
that came from Kemp’s skeletal hand the other that we
saw Meeker give Churchill

AUSTIN
You want to explain this

He means the second ring

CHURCHILL
You went through my stuff

AUSTIN
Just the pocket of your jacket and I’m
glad I did You had another ring just
like Kemp’s You ever planning on
telling us about it Where you got it
Why both men have it

Churchill SNATCHES his ring back

CHURCHILL
No Because it’s none of your business
AUSTIN
Because you want the treasure for
yourself
CHURCHILL

Because you need to go home before the
Curse has me arrested for child
endangerment Now leave

AUSTIN
Not going to happen

CHURCHILL
You bet it will

AUSTIN
Will not

WILL

Absolutely will not

LILY
Guys

Lily’s pulled something out of her backpack

LILY
I hate to interrupt the debate club but
those rings I’ve seen them before

She holds up THE CARDBOARD PHOTO of Kemp Meeker and
the yet-to-be-identified Smith They all wear IDENTICAL
RINGS -- the rings our group possesses

The kids look at Churchill expecting answers

CHURCHILL
What

Lily points at Will

Silence

LILY
Look he’s not going to give up believe
me so you might as well level with us
Where’d you get your ring

CHURCHILL
(shrugs )
Don’t say I didn’t try My Uncle gave it
to me when he died

LILY
Did he say anything when he did About
anything

She points at Will again stubborn

CHURCHILL
Other than he tried to ignore his part in
the heist hoping the Curse would just go
away

They glare at him This isn’t the info they want and
Churchill knows it

CHURCHILL
(shrugs all right)
Not about the ring But he did say there
were three people involved

WILL
Each with a part of the Gate
(chewing it over)
Three keys three rings and three
conspirators

Will points now to each man on the photo First Kemp
WILL

One to bring the treasure over

(then Meeker)
One to fence it

(then Smith)
And one to hide it

(beat)
Which means we find him we find the
treasure And those rings are the key to
finding him

AUSTIN
(turning to the computer)
Bring it on

LATER -- AUSTIN IS AT CHURCHILL’S COMPUTER

The other three watching as Austin leans back He’s
working the internet And he can’t believe it

AUSTIN
Nothing Absolutely nothing on that guy
or the rings Meaning wherever those
rings come from it’s not on the net
Believe me if it was I’d’ve found it

Will’s examining one of the rings

WILL
These have been designed -- like they’re
part of an organization Someone
somewhere must know something about them

Churchill SIGHS Despite himself he’s had an idea
kids look it him He doesn’t say anything

WILL
Look We need to work together We’re
not going anywhere You’re not So we
might as well help each other

CHURCHILL
(finally )
There might be someone someone we could
talk to
(quickly)
But just us You two are staying here
(he points to Lily)
You to guard everything and you --
(pointing at Austin)
-- just because you’re annoying

AUSTIN
Hey --

been

The

LILY
Quiet You are annoying

CUT TO
EXT A PAWNSHOP -- NIGHT
Tucked away on side streets fog wisping
INT THE PAWN SHOP

A BELL TINKLES as Churchill and Will enter Will taking
in the dusty clutter the vaguely unsavory air A WOMAN
comes from the back -- beautiful with an eye patch --
who stares with open hostility

CHURCHILL
aside to Will)
Let me handle this she and I are old
friends
arms spreading wide)
Eleanor

Eleanor WHIPS OUT an ANTIQUE PISTOL from behind the
counter points it right at Churchill

CHURCHILL
holding his hands up)
Okay slow down I meant to call

She moves the gun to point at his groin

ELEANOR
‘And I meant to not pull the trigger
officer’ Give me a reason not to
CHURCHILL

(moving his hands down to his
cover his groin)
Old times sake

ELEANOR
I said a reason not to Who’s the kid

Churchill pulls Will in front of him

CHURCHILL
His name’s Will Like a brother to me

ELEANOR
Then I take him down first

Will gulps at the gun barrel now pointing at him

CHURCHILL
Show her the ring
(as Will fumbles in his
pocket)
We need you to identify this

Will holds out the ring She barely gives it a glance as
she moves the pistol to Churchill’s head

ELEANOR
Why would I do that when I could kill you
instead

WILL

(quickly)

This has an Arabian cat’s eye amethyst --
incredibly rare With writing -- I think
it’s runic And a crest -- Romanesque

late Augustine I’m guessing it’s from
some sort of secret order We need to
know which order

Eleanor hesitates then casts her eye at Will Despite
herself she’s intrigued

ELEANOR
Not usual a kid knowing history

A beat then
INT THE BACK ROOM

Eleanor is at a table examining the ring under a
jeweler’s loupe as Will looks around at the magnificent
clutter filling the shelves around him

A two headed lizard a bizarre mask a skull with a ruby
inlaid a WWII era torpedo Will starts to touch it

ELEANOR
(sharply)
Hands off
(Will freezes)
Functioning and dangerous You never
know when you might need one

There’s a crossbow on a shelf staring at Churchill as
well as manacles

CHURCHILL
(re the ring)
So what do you think

Eleanor picks up the pistol BLAM a bullet lodges right
near Churchill’s head He freezes

ELEANOR
I only talk to the kid
(to Will)
I’ve never actually seen one of these
but I know it
(looking up to Churchill)
What have you got him involved in

Churchill doesn’t answer She levels the pistol at him

CHURCHILL
You said not to talk
(she’s about to fire)
Okay okay I didn’t involve him in
anything He’s just very stubborn

A moment then she looks at Will

ELEANOR
There’s an organization Started out
bootlegging in the 20’s bookmaking
anything on the fringes to make black
market money But these days they’re
much worse Really bad people They
haven’t worn these in public for decades
because they don’t want to be known And
believe me you don’t want to know them

WILL
Where are they

ELEANOR
You don’t listen You don’t want to know

CHURCHILL
You might as well tell him Take it from
me

Eleanor considers then indicates the ring

ELEANOR
I tell you I keep this

CHURCHILL
What if we need it

ELEANOR
(with dripping sarcasm)
Or I could just kill you

OUTSIDE THE PAWN SHOP

Will and Churchill walking away Eleanor in the doorway
with the ring Churchill waves back at her

CHURCHILL
Goodbye Thanks
(not looking at her now)
Is she smiling

WILL
(glancing back)
She really doesn’t like you

CHURCHILL
Are you kidding she loves me

A BULLET SHATTERS A BRICK in a wall near his head Both
he and Will fast walk down the street

CHURCHILL
She just doesn’t know how to express it

CUT TO
EXT A MONASTERY AT THE EDGE OF TOWN -- NIGHT

Several buildings including a central stone church and
several outbuildings

A sign tells us this is St Theresa Mission -- Historical Landmark
INT THE CHURCH
Cathedral-like with stone arches stained-glass windows

rough-hewn wooden pews A ROBED MONK is giving a tour to
tourists a Monk lighting candles

THE TOUR-GUIDE MONK
- established two hundred years ago
the monastery proper still functions

ANOTHER MONK -- round with a bowl-cut the stereotype
come to life -- moves up to WILL AND CHURCHILL who are
just inside the entrance taking it all in

THE ROUND MONK
I’m sorry no more tours today but
you’re welcome to return tomorrow
(nodding at a collection box)
Any contribution you make will go to
those less fortunate

A benign smile and he moves off

Will sees the Monk that was lighting candles move through
AN ARCHED DOOR near the altar -- then notices that
Churchill is uncomfortable

WILL
You okay

CHURCHILL
Churches have always given me the creeps
Too many candles in one place I get
antsy Wouldn’t put it past Eleanor to
steer me wrong just to see me squirm

WILL
Don’t worry We’re where we should be

Will points out that over the arched door is THE CREST
that was on the ring

LATER -- AT THE ENTRANCE

The Two Monks are closing the heavy wooden door on the
last of the Tourists

THE ROUND MONK
Bless you my son

THE TOUR-GUIDE MONK
(as the door is locked)
Tourist duty sucks

THE ROUND MONK
(pulling out a cigarette)
You got a light

Churchill emerges from the shadows grabbing their heads
and BANGING THEM together

LATER -- A CONFESSION BOOTH
The two unconscious Monks are stuffed in tied and
gagged in their underwear Churchill pulling shut a

curtain on them he and Will wearing their robes

They head to the arched doorway -- Churchill pausing to
pull money from the Collection Box Will’s appalled

CHURCHILL
Hey it is for the less fortunate

They pass through the arched doorway --

INTO A DARK HALLWAY

where THREE MONKS walk down a long hall bordering a mist-
covered moonlit cloister Will and Churchill their
hoods up pass them heading in the opposite direction

ONE OF THE THREE MONKS
Domini secorum

Will and Churchill bob several times back As they move

ons

INT

CHURCHILL
Let’s find what we came for and go

WILL
Which is

CHURCHILL
Photos records Anything that might
give us the name of the third
conspirator

WILL
A registry This appears to be modelled
after or at one time was an order of
Benedictine monks Because the cloisters
are there and the living quarters there
-- which means any records or valuable
artifacts are most likely in --

A CHAPEL -- DESERTED

WILL
Here

Will and Churchill take in an ornate gem Stained-glass
windows let in tinted moonlight candles flicker marble
statues scattered around a gold altar

CHURCHILL
A chapel

WILL
Their most private place
(eyeing a statue)
Eleventh century Wow

Will walks to the altar Churchill trailing and seeing
GLASS TOPPED COFFINS lining the room eerily preserved
human figures in them hands folded staring up

WILL
They keep their most treasured in the
safest place possible

He stops at a coffin on the side of the altar Inside of
it is an Honored Brother holding A BOOK

WILL
With their Honored Brothers
CHURCHILL
- Pretty good kid Your Dad would be

proud

Will examines the side of the coffin sees A RECESSED
DIVOT the inverse of the rings they’ve found

He pulls a ring from his pocket puts it in the recess
There’s a HISS and the top SLIDES OPEN And as he
reaches for the book and DISTANT CHURCH BELLS RING --

A MOMENT LATER

Churchill and Will have the book open on the altar and
are turning pages studying it They stop On a page
with HANDWRITTEN NAMES a date after each of them

Specifically they’re eying two names one on top of the
other Sebastian Meeker and Gunthar Kemp the same date
associated with both them

Will and Churchill look at each other -- they found it --
then back to the book the CHURCH BELLS ringing again

CHURCHILL
Noisy for a monastery

WILL
(distracted as he reads)
Call to vespers There

He points to a name just below Kemp’s THE SAME DATE
AFTER IT as Meeker and Kemp’s Oscar Smith

WILL
Maybe that’s our guy He joined the same
day

Churchill sees something at the entrance of the chapel
CHURCHILL

You know when you said vespers -- just
what are they

WILL
The time when Monks gather to worship
usually in

He realizes what he’s saying looks up and sees MONKS
fifteen or so of them gathered at the entrance

WILL
-- the Chapel
(beat)
Maybe they aren’t bad guys after all
Maybe they’re real Monks
All of the Monks PULL PISTOLS and point them at them

CHURCHILL
With guns

Churchill grabs the book looks around -- no way out
except the way they came in

The Monks slowly approach

A beat and Churchill WHIPS OUT his own pistol POINTS IT
AT THE HEAD of the Honored Brother who held the book

CHURCHILL
Freeze or I shoot the dead guy

The Monks hesitate for a moment confused -- and then
INT A HALLWAY

Will and Churchill run past us -- skidding around a
corner and out of view

A moment later a herd of Monks follow clattering around
the corner and disappearing from view as well

After the last footstep has faded

INT CHURCHILL’S APARTMENT

Austin works Churchill’s computer the others around him
the Registry on a table nearby ON THE MONITOR from a
newspaper obituary is a PHOTO OF Smith Lily comparing
it to Meeker’s photo of the three men

LILY
That’s him Oscar Smith

AUSTIN
(reading)
He was already a successful businessman
before the war in import export known
to be a collector of antiquities and --
(meaningfully)
-- he studied architecture in college

CHURCHILL
The perfect guy to help bring ina
treasure and build a place to hide it

WILL
With the organization a perfect place to
have met Meeker and Kemp since they were
all three members at the same time

AUSTIN
(scanning the article)
After the war Smith became paranoid
Withdrew from the world Thought
something bad was going to happen to him
so he became a recluse obsessed with
death Last anyone saw him was in 1946

Suddenly AUSTIN’S CELL RINGS then Lily’s then Will’s
WILL
(going pale)
«- It’s my Mom

LILY
It’s mine

AUSTIN
Mine too Don’t look now but we’ve just
been busted by the Mommy network

They look at each other what are we going to do

AUSTIN
Okay no problem I’11 handle this

He’s about to answer when

CHURCHILL
Hold on Cell phones can be traced

AUSTIN
You don’t know my Mom She won’t quit
until the National Guard’s brought in

CHURCHILL
Five seconds

Austin takes a deep breath answers his phone

AUSTIN
(in a rush)
Hi Mom don’t worry we’re fine we’re on
a huge adventure can’t tell you any more
about it right now tell the other Moms
everything’s okay we’ll talk soon love
you bye bye

He hangs up Beat

LILY
That’s handling it

All the kid’s phones RING AGAIN and Austin grabs Will’s
and Lily’s and FLINGS THEM SHATTERING them

AUSTIN
That is

LILY
What about your phone

AUSTIN
(pressing a button)
Muted Rembrandt wouldn’t destroy his
paints would he
(turning to the computer)
Now let’s find out where Smith reclused
to shall we

CUT TO
INT TORRANCES YACHT

Torrance is at a desk with an ANCIENT PARCHMENT spread
out in front of him the other half of the parchment that
Will has On this fragment we see what Eternity’s Gate
looks like a bowl like object a glow around it (What
Torrance doesn’t have yet is some critical information
that’s on Will’s parchment that the keys and the Loop
are a vital part of making the Gate function)

He looks up as Mira enters from a hi-tech room
MIRA
There was just a cell phone call to one
of the kids We’ve locked its signature
and we’re tracking We’ve got them

CUT TO

EXT A SWAMP -- NIGHT

The group walks along a trail their flashlights stabbing
through mist Nightbirds CAW and here and there the
UNDERBRUSH RUSTLES with the scurry of an animal

Austin WHIPS his flashlight toward a rustle

AUSTIN
What was that

ANOTHER RUSTLE and another whip

AUSTIN
What was that

Lily SNATCHES HIS FLASHLIGHT from him As he grabs back
at it and the two scuffle -- ahead Will’s flashlight
picks out something

LOOMING FROM THE MIST -- A MARBLED PILLARED WALL

with a heavy stone door cut into a hill moss-draped
trees sheltering it A crypt

AUSTIN
- Whoever heard of building a crypt in
the middle of nowhere and just moving in
to die

CHURCHILL

The Curse makes you do all sorts of

strange things
A POV -- FROM INSIDE THE CRYPT
As the door is SLID OPEN FOUR FLASHLIGHTS angle in
picking up a long corridor A CAVE PASSAGEWAY supported
here and there by beams and stone
Churchill notes A TORCH on a wall --
AND A FEW MOMENTS LATER
he touches a match to it -- and a ROW OF INTERCONNECTED
TORCHES FLARE to life Under flickering light we now
see irregular stone tile on the floor and at the far end
the impression of a larger space -- A CHAMBER
Lily steps forward --

CHURCHILL
Wait --

And as she puts her weight on a tile SUDDENLY A STONE
PISTON four feet in diameter POUNDS DOWN from the
ceiling other pillars POUNDING the length of the
corridor Austin pulling Lily back before she’s crushed

As the pistons withdraw back into the ceiling

AUSTIN
You okay
LILY
(nodding)
Thanks
CHURCHILL

(peering at the far end)
Whatever’s down there Smith didn’t want
anyone to get to it

Lily’s intently eying the tunnel

LILY

I can Get to it

(they all look at her)
There was pattern for the pistons Down
then up for five seconds then down
never two right next to each other
always in groups of three

(beat)
I can do this

AUSTIN
Hey

He looks her right in the eye

AUSTIN
Are you sure --
She nods
LILY
I’m sure
AUSTIN

(to the others shrugging)
She’s sure

She steels herself and then she moves

And as the pistons POUND DOWN she dodges one finds a
space between two more avoids another hugs the wall
avoids yet another -- always moving forward just
avoiding disaster -- until

-- she reaches the end of the hall spots a LARGE BUTTON
and PRESSES IT The pistons withdraw into the ceiling

LILY
(calling back)
It should be safe now

AUSTIN
(to Will and Churchill)
You first

THE CHAMBER -- AS THEY MOVE INTO IT

Is lit by flickering torches Filled with objects from
Smith’s life oriental carpets rosewood furniture an
antique chessboard a STEREOSCOPE a table with feet
resembling claws even a WWII VINTAGE CONVERTIBLE
ROADSTER --

-- and in a leather-backed chair A SKELETON shreds of

decayed clothing hanging from it one of THE RINGS on its
hand A SHOTGUN resting on its lap pointed at the skull

where a hole gapes in its frontal area SMITH

CHURCHILL
Looks like he couldn’t take it any more

LILY
Hey
She’s at a table where among old books and other
collectables are ROLLED-UP PAPERS -- and A CARDBOARD
PHOTO that she holds up

LILY
It’s the same as Meeker’s

It is it shows Meeker Kemp and Smith in front of
Meeker’s house

Churchill unrolls the papers identifying them as

CHURCHI
Architectural plans

They show a large room and an intricate door

CHURCHILL
From the looks of them for a place where
a treasure could be hidden

Will moves closer to Smith to get a better look -- and
SOMETHING HAPPENS

A GLOW from the LOOP AROUND HIS NECK -- and then
from THE TWO KEYS outlined in the pouch of Lily’s
backpack -- and then from SMITH’S SKELETON FROM
WITHIN the tattered fabric of A POCKET

-- and as Will approaches the skeleton reaches to
retrieve the third key and as he touches it -- THE AIR
SEEMS TO CRACKLE WITH ENERGY --

-- and wind STIRS WHIRLS -- the glow flares
INCREASING IN INTENSITY ENVELOPING THEM casting
A GOLDEN TINT over everything --

And suddenly all around them THERE’S A RUSH OF THE

PAST COMING TO LIFE -- IMAGES jumping together
WARPING cutting from one scene to another from
one location to another -- SHOWING US WHAT

HAPPENED SO MANY YEARS AGO

IN A LIBRARY -- AN ANGRY SMITH confronts a younger
Meeker pointing to an ANCIENT TOME that’s opened
to a page dealing with the Gate

SMITH
What have we done

YOUNG MEEKER
I don’t understand --

JUMP TO -- Smith slamming his hand on the book

SMITH
This book -- ancient -- about the
Gate We suspected its power --
but so much we didn’t know

JUMP TO -- Smith shattering a glass ina
fireplace Meeker watching

SMITH
It’s Cursed Do you understand
Were cursed And we can do
nothing

JUMP TO A MOMENT LATER -- Smith grabbing a
frightened Meeker by the collar

SMITH
The third key’s at the bottom of
the bay -- where the Curse will get
us if we even try to retrieve it --

ANOTHER JUMP Smith slumped in a chair in despair

SMITH
And the Loop -- somewhere in South
America -- lost -- and we need it

all to remove the Curse the keys
the Loop the Gate everything
But we can’t --

ANOTHER JUMP --

SMITH
We can’t --

ANOTHER JUMP -- and now Smith STARES RIGHT AT
WILL Madness within his eyes

SMITH
You Who are you

Will is taken aback is Smith actually seeing him

SMITH
Who are you What do you want

-- and Smith LEAPS ONTO WILL CHOKING HIM as he
drives Will back --

SMITH
The Gate -- it’s the cursed Gate

-- STRANGLING WILL Churchill moves to pull Smith
off and as he does

THE TIME WARP DISSOLVES -- and as it does so does
the flesh on Smith the hands clutching Will’s
throat turning to bone -- then to dust -- and then

Smith is gone

And as the wind dies and the glow fades as
everyone absorbs what happens Lily moves to Will

LILY
Are you all right

In answer Will only looks to his hand where he holds
the third key

Then there’s A SCRAPE -- a noise from the tunnel All
four look and see

TORRANCE and his group stepping from shadow into light
staying just outside the chamber He casts an eye at
Will

TORRANCE
You are a very resourceful young man If
only I’d known what your father had
found and that he’d sent it to you

Will is staring back at Torrance with hatred

WILL
You killed my Dad

TORRANCE
Regrettably no But not for lack of
trying In the end the storm took him

Will suddenly RUNS AT Torrance Almost gets him But
Quort grabs him throws him back hard onto the floor

Churchill moves even Lily and Austin involuntarily to
help Will but a CLICK OF PISTOLS from Mira and Hawkins
and they freeze

Torrance looks down at Will

TORRANCE
Just like your Father Stubborn
(to his group)
Kill them

Torrance’s hirelings are about to step forward when

LILY
One two

AUSTIN
I know THREE

And Lily PUNCHES THE BUTTON and the cylinders POUND DOWN
-- Torrance and his group DIVING out of the way --

-- Churchill scooping up the architectural plans and the
key Lily stuffing the photo into her backpack --

LILY
Remember the pattern

-- and Will and Churchill plunge one way down the tunnel
Lily pulling Austin the other

AUSTIN
(dodging)
Yipe oops

Torrance FIRES A PISTOL at Will and Churchill a piston
coming down just in time the BULLET RICOCHETING off it

Austin and Lily are in a niche Austin refusing to move

AUSTIN
I can’t go on

Through the spaces between the cylinders MIRA WEAVES
TOWARD THEM grinning evilly talons out

AUSTIN
Never mind

As Austin pulls Lily into the pistons this time

Torrance NODS AT QUORT -- who GRABS one of the descending
pistons grips it tight GEARS GRINDING --

-- and WRENCHES IT FREE and sends it ROLLING INTO THE
TUNNEL bowling over cylinders SHATTERING THEM sending
the whole mechanism grinding to a halt

OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL

as dust spumes Will Churchill Lily and Austin stumble
out look around

CHURCHILL
That way --

But he’s stopped short As THWUNK -- a dart imbeds in
his back His eyes go glazed --

CHURCHILL
Damn Cur

-- and he tumbles face first
Will hesitates -- wants to get the plans and the key from
the fallen Churchill -- but is forced to DUCK as Hawkins
emerges and FIRES an anaesthetic dart that just misses
LILY
(grabbing him)
Come on
She drags him toward the swamp Austin following
THE SWAMP -- A LITTLE LATER
Night birds cry the moon casting an eerie light
Hawkins Quort and Mira CRASH THROUGH undergrowth

probing marshy hiding places with rifles and sticks mist
weaving tendrils through hanging branches and moss

IN WATER

partly covered by overhanging branches the three kids
are submerged up to their neck motionless Hawkins Mira
and Quort just steps away their feet coming closer --

-- almost on them as Will’s EYES GROW WIDE Seeing
swimming right by him A WATER MOCCASIN Death inches
away its tail brushing against his nose He stifles his
reaction Hawkins right there when

TORRANCE (0S)
Never mind

The feet hesitate then leave
TORRANCE

stands near the crypt holding the plans and the key as
his three hirelings approach

TORRANCE
(referring to the plans)
We’ve got these -- to tell us the
treasure’s hiding place And him -- to
tell us everything they know The
children don’t matter any more

As Quort hoists Churchill like a rag doll and throws him
over his shoulder --

IN THE SWAMP

Will Lily and Austin huddle shivering Will
particularly despondent Lily sees something on Austin

LILY
You’re not going to like this

AUSTIN
Like what

She reaches pulls A LEECH off of him with SUCKING SOUND

AUSTIN
(after a beat surprised)
That actually wasn’t so bad
(to Will)
What now

WILL
I don’t know

LILY
(rooting through her pack)
Look Weve got two of the keys and the

photos --

WILL
But not the plans --

AUSTIN
Maybe we --

WILL

Could what Those plans were our way of
finding where the treasure was Without
them there’s no chance

AUSTIN
Hey where’s this coming from anyway

WILL
From reality What made me think I could
do this when no one else could No one --
not even my Dad I’m such a loser

AUSTIN
Will SNAP OUT OF IT
Will blinks
AUSTIN

LOOK HOW FAR YOU’VE GOTTEN US

LILY
Almost to something nobody even believed
existed That’s not so bad

AUSTIN
SO FIND US THAT TREASURE

Will stares at him

AUSTIN
COME UP WITH SOME SORT OF A PLAN

WILL
(after a slight smile)
I will if you stop yelling

They smile at each other then something dawns on Austin

AUSTIN
That actually was a leech wasn’t it

Lily nods and Austin shivers with disgust

AUSTIN
Yuuuuuccccchhh

INT THE CRYPT
The kids pick their way over the debris into the chamber

LILY
What are we looking for

WILL
Anything we might have missed They have
the plans but they still have to figure
out where the treasure room is Maybe
there’s a map here or something else we
missed
He trails off He’s looking at something

AUSTIN
What

WILL
Let me see both of the photos

Lily pulls them from her pack hands them to him

WILL
I thought so They’re not the same

Lily and Austin peers at the photos

AUSTIN
They aren’t

WILL
Nope See Each is slightly off kilter
from the other

They are

WILL
Because they go in that

He points to a table and A STEREOSCOPE

AUSTIN
Hey I’ve seen one of those

WILL
In my Dad’s office I know

He sticks one of photos into one of two slots in front of
lenses a perfect fit

WILL
It’s a stereoscope An old fashioned
device for viewing 3-D photos

Puts the other photo in a parallel slot Then looks
through the viewfinder

HIS POV
Is a 3-D IMAGE of the men in front of Meeker’s mansion
And POPPING OUT OF THE BRANCHES of the tree previously
hidden is A MAP
WILL
looks at his friends
WILL
Now all we have to do is save Churchill

and get that third key

AUSTIN
-- Is there an alternate plan

INT ELEANOR’S PAWN SHOP

Where she looks up as Will and his friends enter Will
reflexively raises a hand

WILL
Don’t shoot

He holds up the second ring

WILL
We want to trade

CUT TO

EXT TORRANCE’S YACHT -- DAWN JUST BREAKING
The yacht moored at the same dock we saw 60 years ago
AT THE SHORELINE
Will crouches in the hazy gray of the morning watching
Lily and Austin shuffle-carrying something long and
cylindrical toward the boat they left grounded on shore

AUSTIN

(hissed)
Be careful

LILY
(hissed)
Be quiet
AUSTIN
(hissed)
You be quiet
Will looks at the yacht
ON THE DECK

Hawkins and Quort look out at the sun just rising

HAWKINS
Beautiful Reminds me of butterflies

Quort spits into the water as unnoticed Will crawls
behind them through a door

HAWKINS
You’ve got no poetry in your soul you
know that
INT A STATEROOM
WHAP Torrance hits Churchill -- who’s tied to a chair --

across his face Just the two of them here

CHURCHILL
(shaking off the blow)
I told you you know everything I know

TORRANCE
Why don’t I believe that

WHAP another blow -- then Torrance picks up the
architectural plans holds them in front of Churchill’s
face

TORRANCE
Where is this
CHURCHILL
I don’t --
WHAP
CHURCHILL

Will you please stop that

TORRANCE
Not until I’m sure you’re not lying to
me

Torrance holds up the key

TORRANCE
Whats this for
CHURCHILL
I don’t know Maybe to unlock the

room

He’s lying but he’s not about to give key information to
Torrance -- and he CLOSES ONE EYE expecting another blow
-- but it doesn’t come He peeks out at Torrance who’s
just standing there

TORRANCE
You know I believe you

CHURCHILL
You do

TORRANCE

And do you know what else I don’t think
you know anything useful at all

He picks up a pistol

TORRANCE

Which means I don’t need you any more
CHURCHILL

Wait a minute -- you still don’t know

where the treasure’s hidden

TORRANCE
Neither do you I’11 find it eventually
And as for the keys -- I’1l just break

the door open I’m so sorry you chose
not to join the winning team Bye bye

As Torrance points the pistol at him Churchill SPOTS
SOMETHING WILL crouched and hiding behind a desk
having snuck in through a partially open stateroom door

Will
like

EXT

Lily

mouths the words ‘stall him’ then taps his wrist
a watch is there mimes stretching taffee

THE CHESAPEAKE BAY

turning the engine of the boat off peering at the

yacht in morning mist a couple hundred yards away

As the boat drifts she looks to Austin who’s crouched
at an open panel on the cylindrical object -- which we
now see is THE TORPEDO from Eleanor’s pawn shop
AUSTIN

Did the patch lady say the red wire or
the black wire activates it

(raising a hand to stop

Lily’s whap)
Just kidding

(muttered)
I think

BACK IN TORRANCE’S STATEROOM
Torrance is about to fire at Churchill

CHURCHILL
Uhh Wait

TORRANCE
For what Unless you know something

CHURCHILL
Not exactly It’s just I’ve been
wondering something About how you found
my Uncle

TORRANCE
- What

He levels the pistol again Will taps his wrist

CHURCHILL
No really wait I’m going to die
anyway the Curse was bound to catch up
with me I just want to know all my life
I was trying to get my Uncle to admit
what he’d done and somehow you got on to
him and planted a spy there just how did
you do it

Torrance considers this His ego gets the best of him

TORRANCE
Okay a dying wish I looked into every
single German Captain found a relative
with a letter with a reference to Meeker
he fit the bill and there you have it
(levelling the pistol)
Goodbye

CHURCHILL
Wait

Will is counting down with his fingers Ten nine

TORRANCE
Why

- eight seven

CHURCHILL
I don’t know

Torrance fed up is about to pull the trigger -- when
Hawkins hurries in

HAWKINS
Sir

TORRANCE
Now youre interrupting Is anyone aware
I’m trying to kill someone here

HAWKINS
We have a problem

OUTSIDE

Steaming toward the yacht is the torpedo As it HITS THE
YACHT EXPLODING AGAINST THE HULL

IN THE STATEROOM

Zero The boat is rocked Torrance and Hawkins barely
maintaining their balance Churchill flung down to the
ground as his chair tips over

TORRANCE
What in the --
(to Churchill)
I‘1l kill you in a minute

And he and Hawkins rush out Will comes over to
Churchill starts to untie him

WILL
(explaining)
Eleanor traded for the torpedo Don’t
ask which body part of yours I had to
throw in

With Churchill untied and regaining his feet Will grabs
the key and starts out of the room

WILL
Come on

CHURCHILL
indicating the plans)
What about --
WILL

We don’t need them
EXT THE FOOT OF THE DOCK
Will and Churchill run toward us Torrance’s crew

swarming the yacht loosening lifeboats the yacht
tilting and sinking as --

AWAITING

is a WWII VINTAGE CONVERTIBLE the one that was in the
crypt Austin behind the wheel as Will and Churchill hop
in --

AUSTIN
Runs pretty well considering

-- and Austin SCREECHES away

A COUNTRY ROAD -- AUSTIN SPEEDING

and occasionally checking the rear view mirror for
pursuit Will in the passenger seat peering into the
stereoscope Churchill and Lily in the back seat leaning
forward as the car bounces on ruts

WILL’S VIEW -- OF THE MAP

WILL (0S)
We should be on the correct road

BACK TO THE COUNTRY ROAD

WILL
If it parallels train tracks

They see the tracks

WILL
- until they head onto an old bridge

The tracks do veering onto a bridge and out of view

AUSTIN SWERVES to avoid a pothole throwing his
passengers to the side

CHURCHILL
Who put you behind the wheel
AUSTIN
Stay mellow I can handle this I’ve had
plenty of practice on Deathrace 3000

He hits a rut and the CAR BOUNDS everyone flying

AUSTIN
Whoopsie

WILL
(peering back into the scope)
There should be a fork up ahead
(there is)
Go left

Austin SWERVES mowing down some undergrowth as he
fishtails onto the new road

CHURCHILL
I really should be driving

AUSTIN
Relax DUCK

They all do almost decapitated by a branch

DOWN THE ROAD

Undergrowth is thickening overgrowing the road slowing

their progress
WILL
(peering into the scope)
Up ahead a road should branch off

He’s right AHEAD barely visible through years of

overgrowth is the opening to a dirt road Austin turns

onto
THAT ROAD

where weeds poke branches obstruct Austin barely
creeping along

WILL
(sees in the scope)
There should be railroad tracks -- on the
right

There are Peeking though undergrowth rusting
LILY

They look like they haven’t been used for
a long time

AUSTIN
(meaningfully)
Maybe since they brought ‘something’
here
WILL

(looking into the scope)
Is there a barn ahead

And the auto breaks through into --
A CLEARING

where a DILAPIDATED OLD BARN looms rusting machinery
nearby the train tracks ending against it and a peeling

sign half-falling off of it Smith’s Shipping
The car SQUEAKS to a stop and they all stare

WILL
I think we’re here

INT THE BARN

Dust motes float in sunlight slanting in through gaps
The main barn door CRACKS OPEN and the four enter rats
scurrying away They look around and see --

-- shipping bins scattered machinery conveyors and
carts and AN OLD HOISTING CRANE with chains hanging from
it -- chains that dangle into a DARK HOLE

They move to the hole and peer down seeing
A DEEP SHAFT

with two rusting ladders one on each side plunging down
into darkness A flashlight aimed by Lily probes the
depths Vaguely the bottom is visible a long way down

WILL

looks at the hoisting machinery over the shaft and then
at the chains

WILL
Maybe they used that to lower the
treasure
(looking at the others)
Which means

LILY AND AUSTIN
(hardly believing it)
» we may have found it

A beat as they absorb this Then

CHURCHILL
Only one way to know for sure

CHURCHILL

is now at a ladder ready to step onto it to test it to
see whether it will hold his weight

CHURCHILL
Shall we

And he puts his full weight on the rung He winces but
it holds

A moment and he takes another step down -- no problem --
then another then another --

-- and Will wearing the backpack goes to the other
ladder Looks at his friends

LILY
You sure

that you want to do this Will nods He’s sure

WILL
I have to know

And he steps First onto one rung -- it holds -- then
onto the next then the next descending

Both ladders GROAN and CREAK as Will and Churchill go
down Here a bolt STRAINS but doesn’t give There an
OMINOUS SOUND comes from a rung but holds --

UNTIL -- A WRENCHING SOUND -- of metal trying to pull
away from metal -- and CHURCHILL’S LADDER SHIVERS

He and Will stop look at each other After a beat

WILL
Maybe we should

Go back up

CHURCHILL
Can’t give up now Not so close

And then SPANG -- a bolt GIVES WAY on Churchill’s
ladder and the LADDER JERKS

Above Lily and Austin look at each other oh no

Will and Churchill look at each other A frozen moment
This is not good

Then a GRINDING METALLIC sound -- SLOW AGONIZING --
from Churchill’s ladder -- then SPANG a BOLT RICOCHETS
off the wall right next to Will’s head --

-- and THE LADDER GIVES WAY -- Churchill holding on for
dear life as it SLAMS AGAINST the opposite wall just

above Will Churchill KNOCKED LOOSE grabbing a hanging
chain --

-- and a REACTION BEGINS as WILL’S LADDER PULLS LOOSE
folding to the other side -- BAM hitting that --

-- Will dropping but GETTING A GRIP on a ladder that
wrenches free -- AND BAM hits the opposite wall --

-- and BOTH DROP getting holds on chains and ladders
weaving their way down the shaft barely avoiding
disaster dodging the domino effect of the ladders as

-- ABOVE from the weight of both of them the LONG-
UNUSED HOIST-CHAIN GIVES WAY a link SNAPPING --

-- and the two PLUMMET into the blackness -- HITTING THE
BOTTOM avoiding ladders that bounce around them --

-- and then Will sees UNSPOOLING DOWN TOWARD HIM THE
CHAIN from the hoist -- but Churchill GRABS HIM and pulls
him to safety as the CHAIN PILES INTO A MOUND

AND ABOVE as the last of the chain settles the LAST
CLINK of the chain coming up to them LILY AND AUSTIN
peer down Seeing only blackness

LILY
(yelling)
Will Will are you okay

WILL
(yelled up distant)
I’ve been better

CHURCHILL
(distant)
Damn curse

AUSTIN
(yelling)
Well get a rope and come down

LILY
(to Austin)
Where are we going to find a rope

AUSTIN
(yelling down)
Maybe

They both seem to see something as
BELOW -- FLASHLIGHTS ARE SWITCHED ON

Will and Churchill taking some steps through the gloom of
a passageway vague CRUNCHINGS and SCURRYINGS underfoot

WILL
(re the crunching)
What’s that

CHURCHILL
What say we just ignore it shall we

A few more steps and they’re in
A LARGE NATURAL CAVERN

shadowed dark pick-axes and long-unused tools scattered
around old carts on disintegrating tracks that end at a

THICKLY OVERGROWN OPENING a few strands of light peeking
though roots THE BAY visible below outside

WILL
This looks to be from around the 1800s --
probably used to get grain to boats in
the Chesapeake

CHURCHI
Until Smith used it for his own purposes

His flashlight picks up SKELETONS in worker’s uniforms

CHURCHI
And killed whoever helped him retool it

WILL
The same way Kemp would have killed his
men and dumped his u-boat --

WILL AND CHURCHILL
(together )
-- except the Curse got him first

Will’s flashlight picks up something in the center of the
cavern

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

They’re at A PORTABLE GENERATOR Will holding a
flashlight for Churchill who pulls a chain --

-- and the GENERATOR SPUTTERS then REVS then LIGHTBULBS
ringing the room FLARE --

-- and we see that Will and Churchill are standing on a
RAISED PLATFORM with a railing at the front of it -- and
they’re looking at --

A LARGE METAL DOOR Art deco in feel Highlighted
subtly by spotlights

A FEW MOMENTS LATER -- THEY’RE AT THE DOOR
Examining it Hundreds of SMALL CIRCULAR OUTCROPPINGS
dot it some protruding more than others The effect is

like reverse stars in dull silver

Will thinks Pushes one It recedes goes flat but
nothing else happens

CHURCHILL
Seems like you’ve got the right idea
But which ones

Will looks back at the raised platform with its railing
at the front And has an idea

A FEW MOMENTS LATER

He stands at the railing holding the stereoscope --
which he raises to his eyes and sees

HIS POV OF THE DOOR

with three of the protrusions STANDING OUT

WILL -- lowers the stereoscope and then --

A FEW MOMENTS LATER -- CHURCHILL

with Will directing him PUSHES ONE OF THE PROTRUSIONS
the one sticking the farthest out And there’s A SOUND
deep within the door as if a mechanism is engaging
Churchill hesitates then presses a second protrusion
again directed by Will -- to MORE GRINDING within And
then THE THIRD ONE

And THE DOOR SEEMS TO HEAVE to moan from deep within --
and it slowly SWINGS OUTWARD toward them

A moment then
THEY STAND AT THE OPEN DOOR

ready to enter and Churchill looks at Will Hesitates
A sense of the unknown waiting for them

CHURCHILL
Whatever’s behind that there’s something
you need to know first

Will waits

CHURCHILL
It was no accident my Uncle sent his
boxes to your library He kept track of
everyone who was looking for the
treasure Everyone He knew about your
Dad Knew it was your job to archive at
the library And when he died he told
me he wanted someone to find it who’d do
the right thing with it You

WILL
Not you

CHURCHILL
He couldn’t find me I was too busy
running from something I couldn’t escape

WILL
We worked this out together

CHURCHILL
Guess I forgot that was possible
Worrying about everything always going
sour made it hard to look past my own
nose Maybe that was my real Curse

WILL
Then let’s do something about it

And they step --
THROUGH THE DOOR

flashlights probing darkness -- Will seeing a lever on
the wall that he pulls down and --

THE ROOM LIGHTS UP
A cavern Filled with treasure Gold coins paintings

artifacts -- swords chalices candlesticks a whole
variety -- and jewels all sparkling

WILL
(quietly)
We’ve found it

A moment then

TORRANCE
Congratulations

Torrance and his three hirelings step into the room --
Mira with a gun aimed at Lily and Austin Hawkins with a
gun pointed at Will and Churchill freezing them

TORRANCE
You’ve accomplished what your father
never could have You should be proud

A beat and Torrance looks at Churchill

TORRANCE
Wondering how I found you Sub-q
tracker implanted when you were
unconscious It’s called covering your
bases

Torrance scans the treasure

TORRANCE
A fortune Pales in comparison to this
though
Torrance aside some jewels -- revealing A BOWL of the

finest ivory so smooth as to almost gleam

TORRANCE
Eternity’s Gate
(beat)
Shall we get to why we’re all here

As Quort reaches for Will’s backpack
A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Torrance is crouched at the Gate the backpack open
With Will’s half of the Parchment that he joins it with
his half

They match up perfectly The torn drawing of the Gate is
now complete a bowl with the three keys sticking from
it triangling to a point where the Loop nestles

TORRANCE
(studying it)
Ah Now I understand how the Gate works
(MORE )

TORRANCE (CONTD)
(glancing at Churchill)
You lied to me about the keys They’re
not for the door at all

CHURCHILL
(shrugging)
Sorry about that

Torrance reaches into the backpack pulls out the THREE
KEYS They begin to glow faintly

TORRANCE
You see my half of the parchment --
which I found in the Sahara by the way --

He takes one of the keys INSERTS IT into a hole in the
rim of the Gate A FAINT GLOW comes from the Gate

TORRANCE
-- only explains what the Gate can do
not how to make it work

He inserts THE SECOND KEY -- the GLOW INCREASING --
Will fascinated watching despite himself as a WAVERING
CURTAIN OF ENERGY appears

TORRANCE
The legends about it are right -- it can
pierce time -- see whatever your heart

desires But it can do so much more
You can actually interact with the past

Torrance puts the THIRD KEY into place VAGUE IMAGES
appearing now within the curtain -- SHIFTING
RANDOM fleeting -- of THE PAST historical
landscapes Renaissance painters a WWII tank
ancient buildings

TORRANCE
Provided I have that Which my parchment
didn’t show either

He indicates the Loop GLOWING on Will’s neck -- and as
he holds out a hand for Will to give it to him --

SUDDENLY

AUSTIN
THREE

Lily KICKS MIRA IN THE SHIN doubling her over her gun
flying off --
And Churchill SHOVES HAWKINS as Hawkins FIRES the bullet
hitting a chalice near the bowl KNOCKING THE GATE
OVER the keys falling out the curtain fading --

-- and a FIGHT IS ON -- one that spills from this chamber
into the outer chamber the artifacts and the tools
scattered around coming into play

HAWKINS attacks Lily throwing shirukins Lily dodging
flinging jewels rings bracelets at him -- whatever she
can -- to try to stop him -- but his attack’s relentless

MIRA attacks Austin who barely avoids her deadly swipes

AUSTIN
Hold it Seriously hold it Really
hold it

He grabs a shield but a nail JABS THROUGH IT

AUSTIN
Yipe

QUORT brings an ANCIENT MACE down at Will -- WHAM -- Will
dodging -- WHAM -- dodging again --

-- until Quort GRABS HIM by the neck -- Will purpling --
but KICKING HIM IN THE GROIN Quort doubling Will

gasping --

TORRANCE snatches up a sword SWINGS IT AT CHURCHILL who
tries to parry with things that keep being cut in half a
candlestick a rotted wooden slat a spear --

UNTIL -- all the battles reach a cascading climax

WITH Will and Churchill side by side -- Quort RAISING A
CRATE about to bring it down as Will scrabbles his hands
behind him to find something --

-- Churchill without a weapon to defend himself from
Torrance’s sword strike SCRABBLING HIS HANDS behind him
as well --

-- while AUSTIN is trapped in a GRAIN CART -- Mira
JABBING just past his head her nails IMBEDDING INTO
WOOD

As she struggles to pull free Austin falls off
inadvertantly sending her and the cart rolling toward

LILY -- who’s been cornered by Hawkins who’s found a
dagger who’s about to strike but is BOWLED OVER and
into the cart as it rolls past going toward

Will and Churchill who each bring forth something to
defend themselves Will -- A SKULL that he FLINGS AT
QUORT hitting him between the eyes staggering him --

-- and Churchill grabbing A SKELETAL ARM -- poking its
bony fingers into Torrance’s eyes -- staggering him --

-- and Will and Churchill SHOVE their opponents into the
cart as it passes -- the cart CRASHING THROUGH the wall
of vines and roots flying out toward the bay

Lily grabs Austin in disbelief

LILY
You -- you saved my life
AUSTIN
Actually -- it was a kind of an --

And suddenly she plants a big kiss on him

AUSTIN
(dazed)
- accidemendrdle
Churchill LOOKS OUTSIDE -- sees the cart floating in the
bay unconscious bodies sprawled on it -- then looks back

into the chamber
Will is nowhere to be seen

CHURCHILL
Will

There’s A GLOW coming from the treasure chamber As the
three move toward it --

A HAND appears at the opening to the outside climbing
up

AND IN THE TREASURE CHAMBER

Will’s crouched at the Gate He’s just re-inserted the
last of the three keys the ENERGY CURTAIN WAVERING as
before as he removes the Loop from his neck

CHURCHILL
Will you don’t want to do this

Ignoring him Will brings the Loop closer to the apex of
the pyramid AN ENERGY BUBBLE GROWING around him

LILY
Will
And as he places the Loop onto the pyramid and the glow
BECOMES IMPOSSIBLY BRIGHT Churchill Austin and
Lily SHIELDING THEIR EYES --

WILL
(looking at them)
I have to see my Dad

AND THE BUBBLE BLOOMS --

and inside it soft-focused diffuse Will sees
HIS FATHER

They’re in -- and yet not in -- an abandoned
MOUNTAIN HUT -- straw on the floor wind and snow
howling outside a window James huddled trying to
keep warm --

-- and he looks up and sees Will Their eyes
meet A moment as James can’t believe what’s in
front of him

JAMES
Will
WILL
Dad
JAMES
I don’t -- does this mean
WILL

I did it Dad I found the Gate
And you were right

CHURCHILL
(from a great distance)
Will
Will takes a step toward his Dad

JAMES
Will -- don’t

Will hesitates puzzled

JAMES
You can’t There are forces --
things -- not to be tampered with

Will wants to come closer to his father You can
see it in his eyes
JAMES

Searching for the Gate -- it cost

me everything

Suddenly there’s a rumbling the hut SHAKING

WILL
Dad --

JAMES
(looking around)
It’s the Gate
(right to Will)

Listen to me I’m proud of you --
so proud of you -- for what youve
done -- you’ve grown into such a

fine young man --

MORE RUMBLINGS items falling off shelves

JAMES
But you have to go now

LILY AND AUSTIN
(distant)
Will

JAMES
The Gate is too powerful Do
understand Do you know what
have to do

Will hesitates --

JAMES
Go before it’s too late Do
is right
- then nods -- and pain in his eyes

heart he reaches for the Loop

JAMES
Goodbye son

WILL
Goodbye Dad

And Will takes the Loop off

you
you

what

and in

his
THE AURA BEGINS TO FADE reality in the form of the
treasure room coming back into focus Churchill Lily and
Austin there still shielding their eyes but able to see
more now that THE GLOW IS DIMINISHING James visible
on the other side -- but FRITZING IN AND OUT Will
preparing to throw the Loop into the curtain --

WILL
(staring at his)
I (love you) --

But he’s cut off -- because TORRANCE LEAPS AT HIM and
GRABS THE LOOP from him knocking him down --

TORRANCE
No I’11 have this

-- holding a pistol -- the curtain fading but still
there James still visible on the other side

Churchill takes a step forward to stop him but TORRANCE
FIRES grazing him on the arm sending him spinning

Will gets up tries to come at him but Torrance KICKS
him in the abdomen knocking him down Places the Loop
back on --

And they’re within the bubble as its glow begins
to grow again

TORRANCE
I’ll have it all

He levels his pistol at Will --

TORRANCE
And the Curse is for fools

But as Will stares up at the gun and Torrance is
about to fire -- JAMES GRABS HIM from behind --
and PULLS HIM BACK into the curtain --

-- and as they fall back the GATE IS KICKED KEYS
AND THE LOOP JARRING LOOSE -- and the aura
fluctuates diminishes James falling into the

hut --

-- while Torrance is caught in A TIME WHORL --
energy spinning around him -- Torrance becoming
older then younger a baby then an old man
SCREAMING as he’s sent ricocheting off to nowhere--
-- the CURTAIN COLLAPSING -- Will catching his
father’s eyes as it does -- James mouthing the
words

JAMES

I love you son

And the time AURA COLLAPSES folding in on itself
-- taking the Gate and the keys with it --

AS SOMEWHERE the GATE WHUMPS HARD into the
ground IMBEDDING all but a just a glimpse of it
buried --

-- while BACK IN THE CAVE the Loop rolls and settles
Everyone too stunned for the moment to do anything

And then Will bends and picks up the Loop Stares at
it Then meets Lily and Austin’s eyes

LILY
I’m sorry Will

WILL
I’m not Not any more

Will looks at Churchill

CHURCHILL
It’s gone The Curse I can feel it

He’s not sure how or how he knows but Will nods He
knows too It’s gone for him as well

They stand there a moment then
AUSTIN
Will Uh About the treasure
Are we still on with the whole let’s all
get rich thing

Lily PUNCHES HIS SHOULDER

LILY
Idiot You think that’s important right
now

AUSTIN

What I’m just trying to be practical

LILY
Idiot idiot idiot
AUSTIN
Does this mean the romance is off

Will has seen something near where the Gate was A
BRACELET that he picks up with a curious expression

LILY
What is it Will What’s wrong

WILL
This bracelet It’s pre-Columbian
Doesnt fit with the rest of this
treasure In fact Id say it’s
(looking at them all)
- it’s from somewhere in the Andes
(beat)
From the Gate

Churchill takes the bracelet from him Studies it

CHURCHILL

You know -- there was a village -- that
we passed through in your Dad’s
expedition That had jewelry that looked
a lot like this That he was heading
toward during the blizzard

(beat)
That was cut off soon afterwards By an
earthquake That nobody’s been able to
get to it for years

WILL
Which means -- Dad could be there
He could still be alive
The gravity of this sinks in
AUSTIN
In the Andes Meaning we’ve got another
trip to make
They all stare at each other
AUSTIN
Can I at least spend a little bit of the
treasure first

And as he begins to stuff jewels into his pocket

DISSOLVE

TO
THE ANDES

Snow capped mountains A stream water dancing as it
ripples and flows

And the CAMERA SHIFTS MOVES Passing THREE KEYS
scattered among the underbrush --

SETTLING ON CLOTHES against a tree -- Torrance’s
clothes -- nothing else but dust --

And AN ACTIVITY nearby A DOG looking just like the one
we saw centuries ago -- vigorously BURYING THE LAST
PORTION OF THE GATE’S IVORY SURFACE

And as the dog trots away the CAMERA RISING following
it -- we see A VILLAGE around it signs of fallen
MOUNTAIN DEBRIS blocking a trail cutting it off --

-- and A WHITE MAN limping using a cane coming out of
a hut James Will’s Dad

-- and as the dog approaches him and THE CAMERA RISES
even further and we see the towering mountains of the
Andes and the clear blue sky

WE FADE OUT

THE END
