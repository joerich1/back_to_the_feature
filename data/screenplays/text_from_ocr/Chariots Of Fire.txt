PREFACE

This first experience with ‘official
sports was conclusive Wherever public
authorities undertook to meddle with any
sports organization they introduced the
fatal germs of impotence and mediocrity
The body formed by the good will of all
the members of an autonomous sport

group becomes swollen to gigantic and
uncertain proportions upon contact with
this dangerous thing called the State

Baron Pierre de Coubertin
Founder of the Modern Olympics
Paris July 1900

These are sour days in Olympic history The bureaucracies of
big business and nation states have finally demanded more of
the original slender ideal than it can possibly bear and its
fatally begun to crack This years Olympiad could possibly
be the last

But it wasnt always so Back beyond Moscow and Montreal
Bundage and the big brass bands Hitler and the Zieg Heils
was a time when the young people who gathered under the five
rings and flame did so of their own volition They were
fired by their own purpose inspired by their own dreams and
seeking only to test theniselves on their own behalf against
the fastest the strongest the highest on éarth

Such men were Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams The one the
son of a Scots missionary destined to follow in his fathers
footsteps and to die in Japanese hands in 1945 The other the
son of a German Jew who battled against prejudice and the might
of the English Protestant Establishment to become the last
Englishman and the only Jew ever to win the Blue Riband of the
Games -- the 100 metres Liddell and Abrahams in 1924 are to
become the two fastest men in the world yet both have their
own individual driving force They run because they have to
Liddell for Gad whose cause he upholds almost to the point of
athletic suicide and Abrahams as a means of dealing a final
blow to the humiliation and bigotry which have haunted his life

They both reach Gold but on their own terms Riding their
‘chariots of Fire’ they fight against and finally sweep aside
those newly emerging Goliaths nationalism and political
expedience those same monsters which today have resulted in
the probable demise of the whole magnificent ideal

Their stories deserve to be told again if only to inspire
todays young men and women the world over to pick up a new
torch to rekindle it and to find for themselves that old
Olympic spirit once more

FADE UP ON
EXT FLEET STREET - DAY i

Filling screen -- BIG CLOSEUP - a medal a gold medal -
hanging on a sky blue East German chest

The DDR dirge ploughs on above the image Then PULL BACK TO
SEE the recipient -- erect -- bland -- smiling a practiced
smile programmed CAMERA MOVES BACK FURTHER TO ENCOMPASS his
teammates second and third -- cast from the same mold They
stand -- a triumphant manufactured trio

CAMERA MOVES BACK AGAIN TO REVEAL they are images on a screen
-- a TV screen CAMERA MOVES BACK FURTHER -- more screens --
the image multiplied a score or more —

Reflections flash before us - passing pedestrians -- London
busses cabs

The anthem is lost in the sound of traffic as a shop window
emerges filled with TV screens London passes them by -- and
their all too-familiar boring story

THEN out of the noise of Fleet Street rises the sound of
singinga congregation

He who would valiant be
Gainst all disaster
Let him with constancy
Follow the master

The CAMERA PANS LEFT -- SEEKING the singings source To the
left of the shop is an alley -- down it we can see an open
church door Inside the rear of the congregation

CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON themerect sombre suited -- solemn
MIX TO

Flying angels vaulting across the screen gilded and triumphant
amidst the pipes of a great church organ reaching for the sky
The light is the pale pastel of a Georgian church interior

THE SOUND OF SINGING CONTINUES

CONGREGATION
(voice over)
Theres no discouragement
Shall make him once relent
His first avowed intent
To be a pilgrim

Cont

The singing soars the angels leap The pipes tremble with
vibrato The voices are strident -- mainly masculine --
forceful yet strangely tonelessschool-assembly-like

PAN DOWN STILL SEARCHING FOR the source

CAMERA MOVES DOWN PAST the Organist enthusiastically pounding
his keys with hands and feet alike -- DOWN PAST the candles
and clean-cut altar silver

CAMERA LEVELS OFF AT the rosy glow of Anglican priests in the
medals and white regalia of the English established church

THEN PAN RIGHT PAST the Rabbi with black flowing beard THE
RABBI HERE

YES THE RABBI Theres no mistaking his calling or the cut
of his cloth

CAMERA ROUNDS PAST the choir of cherubic boys aged it seems
from nine to ninety

CAMERA ROUNDS TO the congregation itself

They sing determinedly making a pit of a chore of it their
“ORDERS OF SERVICE held bravely before them On these is
emblazoned A SERVICE OF THANKSGIVING FOR HAROLD ABRAHAMS
1899-1978

PAN ALONG the family -- adopted son and daughter -- very
English women Harrods shot silked

Their children Harolds grandchildren in prep school spruce

CAMERA MOVES ONTO his contemporaries elderly faded yet proud
and upright white-haired and neck-tied to a man with the red
white and blue of the 1924 British Olympic Team

THEY SING

CONGREGATION
since Lord thou dost defend
Us with thy spirit
We know we at the end
Shall life inherit
Then fancies flee away
Tli fear not what men say
Ill labor night and day
To be a pilgrim

The CAMERA RESTS WITH the rallentando finish

Cont

1 Cont1
CAMERA RESTS ON the face of a small thin gentle man His cut
is identical to that of the others yet his eyes are sensitive

aware without the self-conscious resolution of those about
him

He is AUBREY MONTAGUE -- journalist

THE CONGREGATION SIT in the usual flurry of coughing

CAMERA PICKS UP a tall elderly aristocrat making his way to the
lectern He walks with that complete assurance that comes

with being born with a whole canteen of silver cutlery in his
mouth

This is ANDREW «- the sixteenth Earl of Cumbria -- the athlete
Earl

The coughing ceases as all faces turn obediently up to him --
the Rabbis included

Theres a moments majestic silence -- a theatrical pause
before he deigns to speak He reads from a mammoth bible
half-moon spectacles hanging from his nose tip
ANDREW

Let us now praise famous men and

our fathers that begat us

All these men were honored in

their generations
The old men remember misty-eyed

THE SOUND OVER of running feet Plod plod plodrunning
through sound rhythmic deliberate

Aubrey Montagues face is uplifted as the thud of the runners
puilds with the pounding of many breaths

Harold is looking wp at them as Aubrey pays the cab It
pulls away as they pick up the luggage They walk through
the arch into the inner quadrangle of lawn surrounded by
medieval arches This is the college court They stop and
stare

There is an immediate peace and breathless serenity here
Centuries of stillness yards from the busy street They
gaze about them as the sound of organ music rises from the
chapel

Harold looks up at the spires -- at the stone crosses -- ali
the symbols of English stability continuity -- permanence
-- establishment

INT CAIUS COLLEGE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT 12

CUT TO a sepia still of the Freshers of 1913 -- equally young
-- if anything more stiffly self-conscious

PAN ALONG the faces The lost generation
As we do so the voices of the CHAPEL CHOTR singing grace inLatin
The picture hanging on the Great Hall wall -- lit by candlelight

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Harold standing the picture behind him
His head bowed

PAN RIGHT PAST Aubrey then UP and AROUND TO a list of
‘the Fallen emblazoned on the wall above the top table

MASTER
(voice over

T take the War List and I run
down it Here is name after name
which I cannot read and which we
who are older cannot hear without
emotion -- names which are only
names to you the new college but
which to us who knew the men
bring up one after another

Phe Master is addressing The Freshers dinner A sumptuous
candlelit occasion in the ancient timber-roofed college hall
Hes glancing back at the memorial tablet behind him

MASTER
(voice over)
e spictures of honesty and manly
beauty and goodness and zeal and
vigour and intellectual promise

PAN ALONG the young faces before him -- fresh clean polished
in stiff white shirts and plack ties -- listening

MASTER
voice over
It is the flower of a generation
the glory of Israel the pick of
England and they died to save
England and all that England
stands for

He pauses for a moment to collect himself His young audience
bow their heads His fellow tutors hide their erccion Herold
and Harry catch each others eye across the table

Harry half-smiles reassuringly Harolds gaze shifts to Any
whos sitting erect in complete but respectful control As the
Master continues dwell on each of our characters for what re
says has its own peculiar relevance to each

TO Andy - ultra-privileged -- astronomically wealthy The
elder son of the Duke of Cumbria His is the choice between
dissolute waste or responsible deployment of his immense
advantages °

TO Harry -- Son of a Yorkshire banker - hard-headed but
compassionate Hes chosen medicine as the ideal medium in
which to exploit both traits Great sense of responsibility
towards those who worked to put him here

TO Aubrey -- Gentle son of gentle Southern English middle-
class parents Adz’ cmer with a vaguely romantic vision of
what he wants for himself -- to write a powerful novel To

be a hard-nosed but compassionate journalist He listens with
more than a trace of emotion

And TO Harold - Jewish money-lenders son from Golders Green
First generation German conscious of his Jewishness and feels
a desperate need to carve a niche for himself in the
establishment of his fathers adopted country Hes defensive
ruthlessly ambitious yet intrinsically kind

Over all this the Master CONTINUES

MASTER
And to you gentlemen the new
generation have been bequeathed
the hopes and dreams of those who
went before you Through tragic
necessity their aspirations have
become yours You are doubly
privileged On their behalr I
exhalt you to examine yourselves
assess your true potential seek
to discover where your true chance
of greatness lies Witheut their
supreme sacrifice such opportunities
would not have been yours For
their sakes for your parents for
the sake of your college and your
country seize your chance rejoice
in it and let no power nor persuasion
deter you from your task

Aubrey tiptoes to it and peeps in

Harold is standing book in hand before his small table

Harold looks into the embers

HAROLD

Sometimes I say to myself -- hey
Steady on Youre imagining all
this And then I catch that

of a remark -- feel a cold
reluctance in a handshake

He takes a sip of cocoa Aubrey follows suit

HAROLD

My father -- hes a German Jew
He is alien

(smiles )
Spiritually culturally
linguistically and gastronomically
hes as foreign as a frankfurter --
and a kosher one at that

Aubrey laughs

HAROLD
I love and admire him He worships
this country From nothing he
built what he believed was enough
to make true Englishmen of his sons
My brothers a doctor -- a leader

Harold and Aubrey are strolling over a bridge -- their arms
full of books Their conversation continues

HAROLD
But the old man forgot one thing

halls of intellect her corridors
of power And those who walk them
guard them with jealousy and venom

They WALK INTO VIEW -- amid flying buttresses and towering
Gothic stone

HAROLD

Strangely enough Ive never
consciously felt Jewish Not
even at school And there they
treated me like some rare species
of ape But this place -- look
at it Every stone reeks of
Anglican pomp and complacency
Its enough to deconvert St Paul
I want to stand and cry out and
bring the whole damn place tumbling
down

Harold stops

AUBREY
Well go on Go on -- be a devil

Harold looks at him Theyre outside Kings College Chapel
the Great Rose window above them He closes his eyes
raises his arms up to it and lets out a long mournful chant
in Hebrew People stop and stare When hes finished he
calmly walks on

AUBREY
Feel better

HAROLD
Not really I prefer Gilbert
and Sullivan

They walk

AUBREY
So what now Grin and bear it

OF TRINITY CLOCK - MIDDAY

It says 1150 PAN DOWN TO REVEAL the great square of lawn
surrounded by cloisters and above them students rooms with
mullioned windows opening out onto the court itself In

the windows undergrads sit peering cut expectantly Below

them the square is beginning to fill with excited crowds of
students

Like most aspects of University life there is a studied
casualness about the whole affair It must appear to be
happening almost by accident -- tradition is everybodys
guide -- no organization or presentation is needed - all
slots into place as if by magic

Harold appears clad in an overcoa® over his running kit A
searf flying nonchalantly around his neck Hes accompanied
by Harry and Aubrey plus Robin very much in his official
capacity They push their way across the square to a position
under the clock Theres a smattering of applause and a

swell of half cheershalf jeers Cheers for the courage of
the man and jeers for his downright affrontery

The mob gather around the quartet as Robin raises his hands
in a plea for silence The crowd hush

ROBIN
Right chaps -- Thank you -- please
(clears his throat)
Let it be known that HM Abrahams
of Gonville and Caius has formerly
made challenge for the Trinity
Court Dash

Again the jeerscheers

ROBIN
For those present who are not
familiar with the rvles they are
as follows The Challenger
will attempt to run around the
perimeter of the court to and
from a fixed point beneath the
clock within the time taken by
the sound clock to strike midday
The distance to be covereé is
traditionally recognized as one
of three hundred and twelve pates

Theres a stir of amazement in the crowdand a smatter of
applause again

pumps on and finds a devastating finishing burst from God knows

Its a summer evening in June 1923 -- the exams are over and

nothing remains except to pass the remaining days on the river
PASSING DOWN the Backs SEE everywhere boats containing
parties of men and girls laughing and smoking some moored

to the banks some idly drifting with the stream and all
carrying Chinese lanterns which bathe the river in a soft
pleasant light The trees in full leaf sweep the waters

the air heavy with warmth and insects lies breathless
beneath the fast descending dark It is a scene of harmony
peace and absolute bliss

CAMERA PANS ALONG the bank -- ERRATICALLY -- the idyllic scene
below The boating parties look up and wave and laugh with
delight raw-boatered puntsmen cup their hands and shout --

Punting them up stream smoothly expertly and in the

foreign dirge

The sparse crowd eighty percent standing dignitaries and the
well-heeled occupy the wooden stand behind them

Amongst those standing are Sandy with a friend JIMMIE picking
their way through the assorted groups -- who glance at
programs -- yawn light pipes or show general if silent

Sandy motions to Jimmie that hes moving down to the front
Jimmie winks and they separate

Arrayed across the luxurious carpet the four most powerful
men in Britain turn to face him Seated behind a massive
writing deskleaning back into the deep leather chair clad
in a dinner jacket and smoking a cigarette in a mist of smoke
is the PRINCE OF WALES Seated in a winged armchair to his
right is the EARL OF CADOGAN the Chairman of the

British Olympic Associationa formidable bald character with
a heavy waxed moustache ‘Standing with his back to the
fireplace is His Grace the DUKE OF SUTHERLAND and the
President of the Association -- a spindly figure with that high
forehead thin hair and florid countenance of the inbred
English aristocracy

Rising from an armchair to his left is Birkenhead his hand
extended to Eric as he crosses to meet him

Lord Birkenhead has advised us
as to your attitude towards
your participation in the 100
metres heats Liddell -- or
would your non-participation
be more accurate

ERIC
Im afraid it would sir --

the proper manner in which to
approach the French

CADOGAN
Which is something we just
eant allow A member of
British Olympic Committee
going cap in hand to the Frogs

out of the question

PRINCE
A simple matter of national
dignity Liddell Being a
patriot Im sure you understand

I wanted to run and I was
desperate enough to try anything

Therets a slight pause as the Committee exchange glances --
before Sutherland speaks again

SUTHERLAND
So all that being understood
we decided to invite you in
for a chat to see if there is
any way that we can resolve the
situation

CADOGAN
(impatiently)
Theres only one way to resolve
the situation - and thats for
this young man to change his
mind -- and run

PRINCE
Dont state the obvious
Cadogan Weve to explore
ways in which we can help this
young man to reach that
decision

ERIC
(simply)
Im afraid there are no ways
sir

They turn to look at him

ERIC
T cannot run on the Sabbath
and thats thatI intended
to confirm this with
Lord Birkenhead tonight
even before you called me
before this inquisition of
yours

CADOGAN
Dont be impertinent Liddell -

The impertinence lies sir with
those who seek to influence a
man to deny his beliefs

Cont

appealing to your beliefs in
your country -- and your King

King first and God after

SUTHERLAND
Yes And the war to end wars
pitterly proved your point

He silences Cadogan with an icy look

ERIC
God made countries and God
makes Kingsand the laws
by which they function
Those laws say the Sabbath
is his and I for one intend
to Keep it his and his
alone

PRINCE

(after a

moment
Mr Liddell -- youre a child
of your race -- as I am --
we share a common heritage

loyalty There are times
when were asked to make
sacrifices in the name of
that loyaltywithout them

of the band way over in the arena -- and the swish of Sams
oiled hands as they sweep hard and deep over Harolds prone
pody He is lying face-down on the massage table -- eyes
closed Sam silent leans into his task reverently
Therets an almost religious dedication to his labours -- 4
sanctum-like atmosphere in the room Then Harold opens his
eyes and looks across at the wall Pinned on it is the torn
out picture of the 200 metres finish Scholtz first then
Paddockand himself fifth He dwells on it for a moment
Above him Sam notices the direction of his gaze He says
nothing -- just rubs

Harold sighs neath Sams hands -- then raising his head
turns to look the other way and lowers it again Through
the gloom he sees a figure seated almost unnoticed in the
corner as if ashamed to be there Its Aubrey Hes in
shadow invited in to hear a final confession from the
turbulent Harold

SWISH SWISH Goes Sam Da de da da goes the distant

quietly

EXT THE STADE COLOMBES - DAY 108
Pinal day for the six flyers The stadium is agog with
expectancy -- all the dignitaries are there -- as on opening

day This is the race they all want to see

The band is playing in the centre of the arena -- this time

an American Marine band in honour of their four finalists --
Paddock Scholtz -- Bowman -- and Murchison A medley of
pacey bouncy American tunes adds spice to the already charged
atmosphere

The Prince of Wales is parading down in the arena with other
British officials Birkenhead included Its our chance to
see the primitive field events in progress -- particularly
the pole vault rope climbing and tossing the weight over
the bar Up in the stands Eric is taking his seat with Clare
with them are Jo and Sandy Sandy is looking morose
frustrated Theres a cheer as an American high jumper clears
the bar for victory

INT DRESSING ROOM DAY i109

Silence The atmosphere is beyond tense its rigid The

six men the sixth being Porritt the New Zealander are
quietly changing not daring to look each other in the eye
Even the Americans dont communicate between themselves Its
the time for concentration - for the gathering up of ail
their emotional and intellectual capacities into one explosive
force From the arena above comes the strains of The Star
Spangled Banner They barely notice Harold is just
beginning to undress -- shedding his jacket and tie He
places his leather attache case precisely before him and flick
open the catches He lifts the lid

in his long dressing gown and shoes -- carrying his spikes in

their trays -- counting up their takings Its one big wind
down a turn off for another four years

THEN the Pipes and the Band of The Queens Own Cameron
Highlanders suddenly strike up and march in full splendor
into the center of the arena

Immediately the place comes to life again People departing
stop in their tracks then turn back to catch the new
excitement Press men cease their farewells set down phones
and take notice

The arrival of the Prince of Wales in the Presidential Box
causes fresh excitement and a buzz of anticipation settles on
