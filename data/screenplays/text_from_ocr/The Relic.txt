TITLE CARD BELEM BRAZIL - JULY

EXT BELEM STREETS - NIGHT

A taxi careens down narrow roadways at breakneck speeds

INT TAXI - NIGHT

In the back seat is WHITTLESLEY Early 40s the wreck of a once

handsome man Unshaven Sweat stained Rail thin Scratches on
his

arms a fresh scar on one cheek As the taxi roars downhill
towards

the harbor Whittlesley leans over the front seat (Italics
indicate

Portuguese to be subtitled)

WHITTLESLEY
Faster We wont make it

DRIVER
You want to die

Whittlesley pulls out A KNIFE puts it to the drivers jugular
vein

WHITTLESLEY
Do you

Sweat pouring down his brow the driver re-doubles his speed
EXT BELEM STREETS - NIGHT

The taxi swerves around a corner nearly crashing into a fruit
cart
flies out of sight

EXT HARBOR - BELEM - NIGHT

Light rain obscures the bulky outlines of tethered freighters
We hear

faint laughter leavened with Portuguese phrases distant Calypso
music

from waterfront bars One of the smaller boats the SANTA LUCIA
is

loading as the TAXI fishtails to a halt

Whittlesley gets out sees the boat still at dock His face
floods
with relief

WHITTLESLEY
Thank God

He tosses a handful of bills into the drivers lap sprints up
the

pier as the driver shouts curses after him in Portuguese
Whittlesley

shoves past the dock hands as the last load goes onto the Santa
Lucia

The boats engines churn to life

WHITTLESLEY
I need to speak to the captain
Where is he

The sailors hold Whittlesley back

WHITTLESLEY
Get your hands off me Im trying
to save your lives you fools

Several crew members murmur the word loco Hearing the
commotion a

squat man wearing a billed hat and smoking a cigar approaches
CAPTAIN

FRANCO

FRANCO
American

WHITTLESLEY
Yes Thank Christ somebody speaks
English Im Dr John Whittlesley
You have some crates of mine on
board They were shipped by mistake
to the Natural History Museum We
have to get them off the boat

FRANCO
You have 1D

Whittlesley runs a trembling hand through his hair trying to
keep
control and appear reasonable

WHITTLESLEY
No Let me explain I was on an
expedition for the museum on the
Upper Xingu Something horrible
happened Im the only one who got
out alive I lost everything my
ID everything I have to make
sure no one else dies The crates
the crates were sent out before we
knew Theres something unspeakable
inside If your boat leaves harbor
with those crates on board I cant
be responsible My God if they
reach New York

Whittlesleys fists clench spasmodically Franco looks to his

men
FRANCO
Loco
WHITTLESLEY
No Im not crazy As God is my
witness Im telling the truth
Franco barks an order and several sailors grab Whittlesley by the
arms They start to lead him back to shore
WHITTLESLEY
Dont do this You have to believe
me Your lives are in danger
The sailors laugh But with an almost super-human strength born
of

desperation Whittlesley throws them off He pulls out his
wallet

WHITTLESLEY
Cash Cash you see American money
Whittlesley throws the money down on the deck The breeze
scatters the

bills across the bow and all the men including Captain Franco

scramble for the money chattering in Portuguese While they are

occupied Whittlesley slips by unnoticed and disappears below
deck

INT HOLD - SANTA LUCIA - NIGHT

Whittlesley ducks between cages of goats boxes of farm
equipment his

movements jerky with panic As he continues searching the
camera

moves past him into the darkness of the hold We hear
Whittlesley

mumbling between low ragged breaths At the back of the boat

the

camera finds

A STACK OF CRATES clearly labeled NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM
Move in on

these as The CRATES VIBRATE The boat has started to move

Whittlesley stands bolt upright realizing whats going on

WHITTLESLEY
No

Too late He turns to run back on deck but then stops sniffs
the air

A look of desperation fills his eyes With one hand he pulls out
THE

KNIFE and unexpectedly puts it to HIS OWN NECK Better to kill

himself than face what comes next The knife touches

A NECKLACE of TWO ARROWS one gold another silver

Whittlesley stares wide-eyed into the blackness of the hold The
goats

start BLEATING in blind panic A shaft of moonlight comes
through a

porthole as the boat turns The moonlight falls on

THE CRATES Whittlesleys eyes lock onto them and he inches
towards

them drawn inexorably closer closer

WHITTLESLEY
No no

He begins mumbling a prayer
MOVE IN ON HIS EYES filled with dread as he falls to his
knees
staring always staring at THE CRATES

EXT DOCKS - NIGHT

The crew tends to business and the Santa Lucia points out of the
harbor disappears into the night

EXT LOUISIANNA COAST - DAY TITLE CARD JUNE

Squad cars roar down the back roads sirens flashing In the
center of
the column is an unmarked car

INT UNMARKED CAR - DAY

At the wheel is a strikingly dignified and imposing black man
wearing
a simple old-fashioned dark suit narrow black tie and white
shirt
This is SPECIAL AGENT PENDERGAST FBI

A BACH SONATA for violin and harpsichord plays on the tape deck

Pendergast hums along as he drives A SMALL TOWN COP rides
shotgun

The cop is intimidated both by Pendergast and the mornings
events He

sweats heavily as he brings Pendergast up to date

SMALL TOWN COP
One of the locals found it at dawn
Didnt believe him till I saw it
myself Even then I didnt believe
it Scared my men shitless Me too
I mean hell You could smell ita
half mile away Mr Pendergast

PENDERGAST
(unperturbed)
Any of your men go on board

SMALL TOWN COP
No sir No way None of us wanted
to Im the first to admit it I
said Dont get within a mile of
this thing Its way to big for us
Im calling the FBI
Pendergast nods his approval resumes humming along with a
particularly intricate harpsichord riff As always the man is
unflappable and totally calm as he drives

EXT LOUISIANA BEACH - DAY

The ocean is still the air stifling and close A hot sun beats
down

on the deck of the SANTA LUCIA The boat lists at a crazy angle
where

it has been washed up on the shore At first glance it appears
to be

deserted A barrel rolls back and forth as the boat is rocked by
each

successive wave We hear sirens approaching and the phalanx of
squad

cars pulls up Joining them now are TWO AMBULANCES

PENDERGAST gets out along with the others All of the cops
immediately

cover their faces gagging violently at the smell Pendergast
sniffs

once and frowns Apart from this he doesnt react

SMALL TOWN COP
(choking)
Goin up-wind if you dont mind

Pendergast nods The cops all fall back in revulsion They
watch from

a safe distance as Pendergast approaches the ghost ship His
shiny

laced wing-tips sink in the sand He leans down pulls them off
one at

a time He balls both socks puts them carefully into his shoes
and

proceeds barefoot towards the boat

Using a piece of driftwood as a plank Pendergast leans it
against the

Santa Lucia With surprising agility he leaps up the plank to
the

deck At the top he touches a rail Its covered in a DARK
STICKY

LIQUID

BLOOD Flies buzz loudly A LARGE MACHETE lies abandoned in the
stern

Chairs are overturned A DEAD GOAT eviscerated lies in the
bow A

lifeboat hangs half off the stern Pendergast moves aft The
COPS
watch from the sand below unwilling to get any closer
Pendergast

hears A DOOR slamming open and closed He follows the noise and

sees

THE DOOR TO THE HOLD He approaches pushes it open and looks
down the
stairwell Below deck are

BODIES stacks of them Theyve been TORN TO SHREDS

THE CAMERA MOVES down to one particular man who is nearest the
top of

the stairs Its CAPTAIN FRANCO His face is frozen in a howl
of

terror Flies congregate in the eye sockets With his foot
Pendergast

nudges the body over The skull has been torn open

THERE IS NO BACK TO FRANCOS HEAD

As Margo arrives the camera moves up and over the building
comes to

rest on the imposing turrets intersecting roof lines and Gothic

arches of the MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY This is not an ordinary

building its a 19th century monument to science and mankind
The

structure fills an entire city block

Happy visitors pour into the museum as Margo takes the imposing
wide

stone steps two at a time We hear SCREAMS of pleasure and
release

the normal raucous noises of a large group of THIRD GRADE
CHILDREN

Margo is amused to find herself surrounded by kids Their
teacher

MRS BEASLEY a stern woman in glasses with a thick New York
accent

calls after them as they all head inside

MRS BEASLEY

Mrs Beasley heads into the museum and Larry and Henry merge with
the
rest of the kids Margo turns towards the stairwell passing

IAN CUTHBERT Museum Director a pudgy man in wire rim
glasses who

dresses and thinks like a banker Hired for his amazing ability
to

raise money Cuthbert is one of a new generation of Museum
Directors

whose focus must always be on the bottom line

MARGO
Hello Ian Everything ready for the
opening of the Superstition Exhibit

CUTHBERT

Cuthbert waves merrily A workman uses a LADDER in the
stairwell

Cuthbert is about to walk under the ladder stops and carefully
walks

around it instead Margo smiles goes on upstairs

INT MUSEUM BASEMENT - DAY
Cuthbert enters from the lower stairwell He is now in one of
the

hundreds of areas of the museum that are closed to the the
general

public He follows a labyrinthine route down a dim passageway
lined

with rumbling steam pipes There are storage areas on both sides

labeled ORNITHOLOGY HERPITOLOGY CENTRAL ASIA EXPEDITIONS
AKELEY

EXPEDITIONS WHALE BONE FOSSILS and so on Finally Cuthbert
comes toa

door marked

WHITTLESLEY EXPEDITIONS 1978-95 Cuthbert pauses and gets out
a key

but to his surprise the door pushes open The lock and doorknob

mechanism are both broken off Cuthbert frowns

CUTHBERT
What the

He goes inside
INT WHITTLESLEY COLLECTION BASEMENT - DAY

Cuthbert flips on a light to see a tall narrow space Stacks of
metal

shelves reach up into the gloom Everywhere we see spears
shields

masks various artifacts Ancient tribal costumes lie shrouded

in

plastic like corpses against the walls And in the middle of the

gloom sitting ominously in the light of a sole hanging bulb
are

THE WHITTLESLEY CRATES The same ones last seen in the hold of
the

ill-fated Santa Lucia They are scattered about in disarray
One in

particular has been broken open its contents spread on the
floor

Cuthbert mutters in surprise and dismay kneels by the crate

CUTHBERT
No it cant be

Cuthbert feels gently through the packing material lets out a
sigh of

relief as he pulls out a figurine It is a small beautifully
carved

statue of A MONSTER crouched on all fours
The room falls totally silent as Cuthbert studies THE RELIC
Its a

truly frightening piece massive razor sharp claws large
round

nostrils enormous teeth and red rimmed eyes Suddenly Cuthbert
sees a

DROP OF BLOOD on his hand Hes been CUT

CUTHBERT
Damn

Cuthbert rises shakes his finger in pain Blood drips on the

floor
He pulls out his pocket handkerchief and wraps the wound The
handkerchief rapidly soaks through Suddenly a HAND CLAMPS on
Cuthberts shoulder Hes not alone He lets out a YELP almost
dropping the Relic and spins to see

A MUSEUM GUARD standing behind him His nameplate reads
BEAUREGARD

Hes a gentle young fellow with white blond hair and a rolling

southern accent

CUTHBERT
Beauregard You scared me half to
death

BEAUREGARD

Im sorry sir You okay

CUTHBERT
Someone broke into this room

BEAUREGARD
Anything missin

CUTHBERT
Doesnt look like it Were damned
lucky This statue is priceless

Cuthbert holds up the RELIC of THE MONSTER Beauregard stares

CUTHBERT
Mbwun A South American warrior
deity He carries a powerful curse
Every member of the expedition that
found this statue died

Beauregard sees Cuthberts cut finger

BEAUREGARD
Looks like the curse is still at
work

CUTHBERT
The claws are sharp I must have
cut myself
(uneasy laugh)
Better move these crates to the
secure storage area where theyll be
safe

Beauregard studies the door as Cuthbert heads out with the
figurine

BEAUREGARD
Dont know if itll do any good Mr
Cuthbert

CUTHBERT
Why not

BEAUREGARD

No one broke into this room sir
Someone broke out That lock was
torn off from the inside

Cuthbert glances at the evil face of Mbwun pales As he exits
HOLD
ON BEAUREGARD left alone with the crates

INT PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY

Huge centrifuges hissing autoclaves electrophoresis apparati

glowing monitors elaborate blown-glass distillation columns and

titration set-ups One of the most advanced technical facilities
of

its kind And mixed in with all the modern machinery are

SKELETONS OF ALL KINDS Complete homo sapien specimens are
scattered

around the room Standing midst all this is GREGORY KAWAKITA
early

twenties Kawakita makes sharp jerky overhead movements with
his left

hand waving something about Hes practicing casting We hear
the

zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as MARGO ENTERS
A fly

whips out passing right under her nose

KAWAKITA
Third from the end Right shoulder
Aleut provenance unknown

The fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the
third

skeleton from the end labeled Aleut provenance unknown Margo

rolls her eyes and Kawakita smiles with pride

KAWAKITA
If I spent half the time on my
Fractal Evolution thesis that I
spend on this fly rod Id have my
PhD

MARGO
(small smile)
But at what a price

Kawakita reels in his line as Margo drops her backpack on her
large

desk An enormous MICROSCOPE stands by the equally imposing
computer

topped by a tiger skull A screen saver of an animated
pterodactyl

plays Margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth hits some keys
revealing

columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the
computer

screen

MARGO
I have the species identification on
these teeth We can extract DNA and
start running tests on the
extrapolator program Call Dr
Frock He wanted a demonstration

KAWAKITA
Margo you havent heard

Margo is already out the door
INT CORRIDORSSTAIRWELL - MUSEUM - DAY
Margo charges through double doors leading into the southwest

tower
She half runs down an elegant Edwardian fifth-floor corridor

her

footsteps lost in the thick carpet At the very end is a heavy
oak

door bearing a plate entwined with bronze leaves that reads
simply

Dr Frock
INT FROCKS OFFICE - DAY
Margo bursts into the unique office which is in startling

contrast to
the modernity of her own Two large bow windows look out over

the

park Upholstered Victorian chairs in a leaf motif sit on
needlepoint

carpets featuring large red roses Plant specimens and drawings
of

flora and fauna line the walls Cardboard boxes cover the floor

Seated in a wheelchair is a white-haired man in a tweed jacket
and a

loud floral tie Glasses slip down his nose

This is DR FROCK and hes in the middle of packing He looks

up
smiles apologetically

DR FROCK
Hello Margo Sorry about the mess

MARGO
Is it true Greg said youd been
fired

FROCK

Yes Bit of a shock But as Cuthbert
so tactfully put it the museum

needs new blood And since Ive been
here since the Mesozoic Era --
MARGO
I dont believe it

FROCK
Now Margo dont overreact Cuthbert
has to cut costs somehow My leaving
makes perfect sense This isnt
exactly early retirement Ive
overstayed the party a bit

MARGO
We cant do without you Youre one
of the foremost authorities on
primitive pharmacology Youre
practically an institution around
here

FROCK
That apparently is the problem
Im yesterdays news Who needs a
Curator of Plant Biology in a museum
with one exhibit on plants Monsters
and dinosaurs cannibals and shamans
are the new currency of the realm

Frock goes back to his work packing to hide his emotion and Margo
moves to his side She pulls Frocks books back out of the box
returns them to his desk

MARGO
Phyletic Transformation and the
Tertiary Fern Spike is not going
anywhere Ill talk to Cuthbert and
put a stop to this right now

She starts for the door and Frock wheels into her path Now for

the
first time she sees what hes been carefully hiding the deep
pain in
his eyes
FROCK

Please Dont humiliate me further

MARGO
Let me help I can take care of
everything

FROCK
No Margo This is one problem you
cant solve You have to stay out of
it The fact is I want to retire

MARGO
How can you say that You know its
not true

FROCK
Yes it is Im tired and Im no

longer needed --

MARGO
My work on fossil intermediates
would be crippled without you

FROCK
With all due respect dear thats
bull You dance rings around me with
your new technology Youve left me
in the dust

MARGO

(stubbornly loyal)
Your work is highly relevant What
about your display on Primitive
Pharmacology Cuthbert told me
himself he was going to feature it
prominently in the Superstition
Exhibit

FROCK
Healing plant use among the Ki tribe
of Bechuanaland has been cancelled
to make room for Tibetan Erotic Art

Frock reaches out and squeezes her hand gently with a look that
says
the discussion is over

FROCK
Come on Ill walk you back to the
elevator

MARGO

Im not giving up

FROCK
You must

INT MUSEUM HALLWAYS - DAY

Frock rolls back down the hall the way Margo just came Margo is
beside him downcast Shes not used to defeat
FROCK
This isnt a death sentence Greg
has promised to teach me fly
fishing Ill garden Ill write

MARGO
You are this museum It wont be the
same without you

FROCK
Everyone needs a change of scenery
Ive been rolling down these halls
for forty-odd years Thats quite
enough

Margo gets in the elevator reluctantly He smiles and meets her
eye

FROCK
Ill see you at lunch

He waves her off merrily But once the doors close and Margos
out of

sight Frocks smile fades and his shoulders sag He ducks his

wheelchair quickly into the Hall of African Mammals

INT HALL OF AFRICAN MAMMALS - AFTERNOON

Two stories high dark and dramatic A very special display
Dioramas

of lions hippos wart hogs etc In the middle is a large statue
ofa

GORILLA beating its chest Frock takes refuge in the darkness of

quickly

wipe the back of his hands across his eyes

Look at this A Komodo dragon

As Larry checks out the huge dragon-like reptile which has
just

sunk its Jaws into a stuffed boar Henry points to a stuffed
Gecko

climbing vertically up the side of its case

HENRY
Check out this one It can walk up
walls

Larry already has his eyes on the far end of the hall where
temporary
barricades have been put up to prevent access to the next room
Painting is in progress Scaffolding just begs to be climbed

Henry

runs over and starts up the scaffolding Larry hesitates

HENRY
Dont be a wuss Come on
The boys continue onward more slowly their footfalls echoing in
the
silence
INT BACK HALLWAYS - DAY
The children are now far from the other tourists and their class
Larry is frightened The hall takes a sharp dog-leg ending in a
darkened cul-de-sac full of display cases filled with hideous
carved
masks Against the side of the chamber is a barricade of wood
which
looks much like a wall Henry tugs at it and the barricade
moves He
looks behind
HENRY
Hey theres a secret staircase back
here Cool
Henry disappears behind the barricade leaving Larry completely
alone

in the dark room with the Shaman masks
LARRY
Henry come back

Henry doesnt respond The lights in the cases throw strange
shadows

Larry starts to sniffle falls to hiccuping sits down He pulls
ona

little flap of rubber thats coming off the toe of his sneaker

No answer Larry rises and peeks behind the barricade He sees
the

circular stair It descends into total darkness From below

to

cry

LARRY
Henry Henry It smells awful
Answer me Are you all right

Larry can barely see a dim hallway stretching out in two
directions
He pauses near the bottom of the stairs eyes wide holding his
breath There appears to be a darker area of SHADOW at the end
of the
hall Its gliding TOWARDS THEM

Suddenly something CLOSES on Larrys leg and he YELPS Its
HENRY

Henry pulls Larry the rest of the way down the stairs They
stand

alone together in the darkness Henry hisses

HENRY

LARRY

HENRY
I dont know But I think its bad

Night watchman who found the body
Sweet old man Been tossing his
cookies for over an hour Not a

The photographer is finally ready and he floods the dark room
with

Yes Id say were definitely
working on the same case
INT IMAX ROOM - DAY
An old 19th century theater Balconies Heavy curtains It
looks like

the theater where Lincoln was shot with the exception of the
most

recent addition an IMAX SCREEN five stories high The room is
filling
with museum employees all murmuring anxiously Margo sits down
next

to Frocks wheelchair Her face is ashen

MARGO
Dr Frock I just saw a man back
there whod been wading in blood

As Greg Kawakita sits in the chair next to Margo

MARGO (CONT)
For once Im glad youre rumor
central What in the world is going
on

KAWAKITA
Someones been murdered Not shot
strangled or stabbed either Torn
limb from limb Theres talk of a
psychotic killer or even an animal

FROCK
For heavens sake Greg someones
been killed Look its Cuthbert
Lets hear what really happened

At this everyone falls silent and IAN CUTHBERT steps forward to
address the crowd He appears drawn and grey

CUTHBERT
This has been a tragic and upsetting
morning I have terrible news for us

all A member of our security force
has been found murdered The police
have just informed me it was Daniel
Beauregard

(murmuring fills the room)
Quiet Please With the help of our
head of security Mr Ippolito the
museum has been secured

IPPOLITO rises in the back and nods to the crowd Hes an
imperious

looking pompous man with shifty eyes Right now hes defensive

Overnight his job is on the line

CUTHBERT
The police are satisfied were in no
danger that were all perfectly
safe Weve been asked to remain in
the Gem Room and be available for
questioning for the rest of the day
Obviously we will all do everything
we can to cooperate Are there any
questions

Ippolito raises a hand

IPPOLITO
The party for the opening of the
Superstition Exhibit I imagine in

the light of whats happened it will
be pushed back

CUTHBERT
No action has been taken yet The
opening of the exhibit is crucial to
the financial health of this museum
So for now we expect that the
Superstition Exhibit will open on
schedule tomorrow night

Ippolito registers surprise The audience buzzes again
INT GEM ROOM - DAY

Margo Dr Frock and Greg Kawakita enter The room is full of

spectacular displays of gemstones of every type Greg drapes
himself

over a grey sofa Margo leans on a giant geode

MARGO
That Cuthbert What a piece of work
Someones dead and all he cares
about is his Superstition Exhibit

FROCK
Cuthberts counting on the
exhibitions success The museum is
in debt Contributions and public
funding have dried up Admissions no
longer cover overhead The last big
infusion of cash we had was the King
Tut exhibit Cuthbert was hired to
get us out of the red If the
Superstition Exhibit isnt
lucrative hell have to start
auctioning off some of these gems

KAWAKITA
With all this bad publicity its no
wonder he looks like that
They glance over and see Cuthbert in the corner He appears ill
is

compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a
RABBITS

FOOT Frock goes over to speak to him followed by Margo and
Greg

FROCK
Tan Are you okay

CUTHBERT
(shakes his head)
Beauregard I cant believe it I
may have been the last one to see
him alive He was with me just
yesterday when I got out the statue

of Mbwun
MARGO
(taken aback)
Mbwun
KAWAKITA

(sensing more gossip)
Whats that

Margo frowns suddenly uneasy She and Dr Frock exchange a
look

MARGO
Warrior deity of the Kothoga an
extinct South American tribe Dr
John Whittlesley led an expedition
that found the only known
representation of Mbwun The statue
is said to carry a curse

(she looks away quiet)

Every member of Whittlesleys
expedition died

CUTHBERT
I got the relic out yesterday to put
on display Beauregard was there
The crates had been broken into and
the contents were strewn about But
nothing was missing It was
downright weird We joked that it
was the curse of Mbwun Im not
laughing now

FROCK
Come Ian We all know youre
superstitious But youre among
scientists here We deal in facts
That statue had nothing to do with
what happened to Beauregard

CUTHBERT
All I know is everyone who has come
in contact with that relic is dead

DAGOSTA

PENDERGAST
Yes Thats my case Now its yours
All the corpses were badly mutilated
in a very particular way
Decapitated Brains extracted Limbs
torn to shreds It looked like the
work of a large animal but there
was no sign of an animal on board

DAGOSTA

down this curvy staircase At the
bottom was a big shadow

LARRY
Big as a house

HENRY
Not that big

LARRY
Well almost Depends which house It
smelled like old hamburger and it
made this weird noise

Henry makes a low GROWL in his throat DAgosta suppresses a
smile

shoots Pendergast a look But Pendergast watches the kids
intently

LARRY
And it snuffled the ground like a
dog

HENRY
Like this

He goes on hands and knees sniffs the ground

LARRY
It had a long tongue teeth this big
and yellow eyes

HENRY
They were green eyes and they were
slit like a lizards

LARRY
They were yellow

HENRY
Youre color blind
BEASLEY

(to DAgosta)
These two get in a lot of mischief
and they tell some amazing whoppers

DAGOSTA

HENRY
This isnt a whopper Its the
truth

Pendergast now moves forward pulls up a chair as if deeply
interested

PENDERGAST
How did you get away

HENRY
We ran and screamed and stuff And
we got through a little door just in
time There was a guard there and he
went back to check

Height well I cant give a height
because Mr Beauregard has been
decapitated The state of the body
is such that other identifying marks
are out of the question There are
numerous lacerations proceeding from
the left anterior pectoral downwards
through the sternum and terminating
in the abdomen This is a massive
wound two feet long and a foot
wide The head has suffered severe
trauma and the occipital portion of
the calavarium has been crushed and
removed It almost looks like

If you dont mind a suggestion you

might try a saliva test

Gross and DAgosta look at Pendergast

from woofing all over the place

DAGOSTA

Saliva test You mean you thin
someone ate part of the brain

PENDERGAST
Correct

A long moment of silence then Zwiezic uses
saliva
test puts the result in a petrie dish

DR ZWIEZIC
Okay One saliva test Now
look at these lacerations They
start wide and then converge

Pendergast leaps up Margo has appeared in the doorway behind
him a
cup of coffee in her hand

PENDERGAST
Special Agent Pendergast FBI
Forgive me I guess I was snooping

What is this

MARGO
An invention of mine Its a
computer program designed to
describe the characteristics of a
given species from a reading of its
DNA I call it the Genetic Sequence
Extrapolator

PENDERGAST
How does it work

MARGO
With a DNA analysis from a fossil
you can use this program to tell the
species and sex of the animal
whether it was nocturnal what it
ate how it hunted how big it
was
(abrupt)
You arent here for a lesson in DNA

PENDERGAST
No
(a moment)
I came to talk about Dr John
Whittlesley
Margo turns to put down her coffee She takes a moment to
compose
herself When she turns back her voice is quiet

MARGO
Somehow when all this happened I
knew it would come back to John Is
he really dead

PENDERGAST
Maybe not

MARGO
If he were alive hed have contacted
me

PENDERGAST
You have time to talk

INT MUSEUM HALLS - NIGHT

Pendergast and Margo walk together though various exhibits and
halls

They pass dioramas of ferocious wild animals that have been tamed
and

stuffed behind glass

PENDERGAST
Dr Whittlesley was last seen in
Belem Venezuela a week after the
rest of his expedition disappeared
A taxi driver drove him to the
harbor where he boarded a cargo
boat That boat washed up in my
district Everyone on board was
killed

MARGO
And John

PENDERGAST
Disappeared His body wasnt among
the victims

MARGO
I dont understand

PENDERGAST
The people killed were mauled and
their brains were eaten Just like
Beauregard One part of the brain
was extracted with surgical
precision The hypothalamus and
thalamus to be exact

Margo pales

MARGO
John couldnt have anything to do
with a horrible thing like that He
was a fine man despite his
problems --

PENDERGAST
You loved him

MARGO
(a moment taken aback)
Yes Once We met at Columbia John
held the Cadwalader Chair in
Statistical Paleontology when I was
a grad student there

PENDERGAST
You were going to be married

MARGO
How did you know that

PENDERGAST
I ran an internet search on Dr
Whittlesley Got a list of his
scholarly articles and the
engagement announcement in the
Times I also found a record of your
restraining order

MARGO
That was two years ago John was
still in love with me
(she looks down)
He wouldnt leave me alone

PENDERGAST
You were afraid of him werent you

MARGO
He was afraid of himself He tried
suicide once He was ill Manic
depressive He had wild emotional
highs and lows Not a happy
affliction for a scientist Hed
been revered in our community By
the end he was a joke
PENDERGAST
Tell me about the last expedition
What was he looking for

MARGO
A legendary monster called Mbwun

PENDERGAST
A monster

MARGO
Yes He developed his own theory
that he called the Calisto Effect
It held that evolution wasnt always
gradual or driven by natural
selection The environment would
sometimes cause sudden and grotesque
changes which could result ina
monster species It made no sense
But he felt he had evidence that
Mbwun was such a monster living in
isolation on the tepui for thousands
of years

PENDERGAST
What happened

MARGO
No one knows The Kothoga who live
on the tepui are cannibals

Margos voice catches again Pendergast reaches for his
handkerchief
but she shakes her head determined to keep control

MARGO
No Im all right I wont let this
affect me anymore John wouldnt get
help His ego endangered the lives
of others His theory came first

PENDERGAST
What if Whittlesley arrived on the
tepui and no monster was there Was
he desperate enough to create one

MARGO
I dont understand

PENDERGAST
Something came up in autopsy
tonight Imbedded in Beauregards
body we found a claw

MARGO
My God Then it was an animal

PENDERGAST
I dont think so I think we were
meant to think it was Mbwun Did
Whittlesleys monster have claws

MARGO
I dont know He sent back a statue
thats supposed to be an exact
representation But Ive never seen
it Its in the exhibit

PENDERGAST
Would you mind showing it to me

INT SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

This exhibit is unlike anything weve seen in the museum

Horrifying

artifacts under single spots appear to float in a velvet

blackness

Patterns of light and shadow play over skeletons and voodoo

dolls

There are tombs a torture chamber and endlessly curving

like

winding halls

Without further discussion

PENDERGAST
Where would we find it

MARGO
Im not sure We should split up
You take that hall and Ill take
this one

PENDERGAST
All right Im as macho as you are
Perhaps

Pendergast behind

ON MARGO

As she finds herself alone

slowly

The silence is intense

maze-

Margo takes the right fork leaving

She heads
into another long dark tunnel passing a set of Maori tattooed
heads

The eyes are stuffed with fibers the shriveled lips are drawn
back

from rotting teeth Margo passes without a look

ON PENDERGAST

In another part of the exhibit he nears a Mayan tomb A
skeleton in

the center wears a headdress and tribal robes Gold rings
encircle

bony fingers Pendergast takes a moment to appreciate it heads
into

the next hall

ON MARGO

getting farther from pendergast and ever deeper into the gloom
The

walls around her are lined with symbols of witchcraft There are

shaman dancers masks covered in grasses and shells From the
New

Guinea coast there is Kokpah God of a secret male society and
Zoe-

ba an awesome mannequin in black costume with an angry pointed
mask

Finally the walls open up into another gallery Beyond it is
more of

the shadowy hall Margo stops and for the first time she wavers
This

gallery is the most frightening yet It features images of THE
DEVIL

from different cultures around the world

In the dim light Margo is dwarfed by abhorrent statues of SATAN

TORNARSUK (the Eskimo evil spirit) INCUBI from India Tibet New

Guinea etc And there in the center of the gallery sitting on an
altar

and lit by a spot is a small figurine Margo is instantly drawn
to

it As she gets close enough she sees the label in Gothic
letters

MBWUN
Savage God of the Kothoga also

known as HE WHO WALKS ON ALL
FOURS
The statue is terrifyingly life-like Margo stares at The Beast
Mbwun

is covered in scales and stiff hair with glittering green eyes
and

crude reptilian features The figure is hunched over ina
threatening

crouch Its long forearms trail to the ground ending in THREE
LARGE
CLAWS

ON MARGO she starts then remembers Pendergast

MARGO

No answer She turns tries again louder

MARGO

Her voice catches as she stops and sniffs the air A STENCH
rolls over

her She covers her face backs up holding her breath

MARGO
What the

She steps directly into a nasty statue of the Tibetan lord of the

Dead Margo starts steadies the statue The room is silent
once more

But then unmistakably she hears it An odd rustling sound
Slow

Deliberate Maddeningly soft on the thick carpet And another
wave of

THE SMELL Margo looks in the direction she came down the long
dark

hall Her voice comes out a bit frightened as she calls

MARGO
Pendergast

(no answer)
Whos there

But now she freezes At last shes truly scared A shadow
black

against black is gliding stealthily towards her moving over the

display cases and grinning artifacts

Margo stands stock still her eyes on the shadow She lets out a
small

gasp of shock She cant believe her eyes It defies reason
Slowly
she backs up She slips quietly through the exhibit and out the
other

side In the next room she pauses again listens now hearing
a

distinctly animal SNUFFLING SOUND

Something large is TRACKING HER Theres no doubt

Overcome by a blind panic Margo turns and runs She passes
through a

display on mythical creatures disappears down another winding
dark

hall

Behind her comes

THE POUNDING OF SOMETHING IN A HEAVY LOPING RUN Whatever it
is its
charging after her She turns another corner And another
tearing as
fast as she can But now the walls up ahead are narrowing
leading to
a DEAD END

Margo slams up against a locked door with a window of glass The
hall

features displays of terrifying totem poles All around the
ghoulish

carved faces seem to leap out She pounds on the door but its

useless Shes trapped And the thing is coming behind her
Its just

around the last bend when it stops Silence again envelops her
Shes

afraid to turn She can hear HEAVY BREATHING and something like
a low

growl Reflected in the glass of the door in front of her is the
long

dark hall Margo starts as a face appears IN THE REFLECTION

The image is wavering and unclear Its a large hulking form
behind

her TWO GLOWING SLIT GREEN EYES in the dark Margo SCREAMS as
the

thing leaps forward hitting one of the totem poles Margo sinks
to

to Ill come relieve you myself

Doyle shuts off his walkie talkie frowns He fidgets looks at
his
watch once more

DOYLE
What the hell

He turns takes off the walkie talkie and leaves it but then he
hears

something stops Its a low SCUFFLING from inside the exhibit
coming

from behind the closed doors Doyle freezes turns

DOYLE
McNitt

No answer Doyle pauses His hand goes to his gun for
reassurance as
he hears a footstep and a muffled thump He moves to the door of

the
exhibit opens it and takes a step inside
DOYLE
McNitt Cut the crap I know its
you Youre not scaring me Come on
Silence meets him The shadows of the exhibit loom Doyle takes
one

more step inside scanning the darkness with his gun Does he
hear

BREATHING He freezes Yes he does The hair on his neck
rises and he

loses the spit in his mouth He takes a step backwards but hes
half

a second too late The door SLAMS BEHIND HIM and a HUGE DARK
FORM

LEAPS OUT

INT EXHIBIT ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Officer MCNITT enters from a side corridor zipping up his fly
The

hall is still McNitt checks his watch sees Doyles walkie
talkie and

turns it on

MCNITT
McNitt here Im outside the
exhibit Alls quiet But I dont
see Doyle
BAILEY (OS)
He called a minute ago looking for
you He starts vacation tomorrow and
he wanted out I said you were on
the way He could split

MCNITT
Well hes gone

BAILEY (OS)
Any sign of a green-eyed monster

MCNITT
(chuckles)
Nope

McNitt shuts off the walkie talkie settles at his post

INT SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT

In the blackness a large shape is MOVING QUIETLY dragging its
prey

across the floor We move in on the lifeless form of DOYLE His
face

is rigid with terror his eyes frozen open wide The last thing
we

hear as the hulking form heads back into the darkness is the
SNAPPING

of Doyles skull

DISSOLVE TO
EXT MUSEUM - DAY

Signs announce that the Superstition Exhibit opens tonight The
museum

is back in business but not many people are going in A crowd
lingers

at the margins pointing at the building Several hold a copy of
the

POST with a graphic photo of the bloody floor by the circular
stair

INT CUTHBERTS OFFICE - DAY

Cuthbert stands by the window of his palatial office looking out
at

the scene below His face is pinched with worry Slumped ina
chair is

Lieutenant DAgosta Pendergast surveys some paintings on the
wall
PENDERGAST
I had no idea the Museum had a
complete collection of Piranesis
Forum sketches

CUTHBERT
If you like them theyre for sale
Another day like yesterday and half
the collection will be on the block

PENDERGAST
Ive read about the Museums
financial troubles

CUTHBERT
Weve been operating in the red for
years That was the whole idea
behind the Superstition Exhibit It
was designed to pull people in
Weve spent every penny we have on
advance publicity betting
everything on the openings success
If we postpone at the last minute
No I dont want to think about
that

DAGOSTA
(chews on his toothpick mild)
We all love the museum I come here
myself with my kids Were trying to
work with you

CUTHBERT
I appreciate that

PENDERGAST
If the party goes forward and
thats a big if Ive arranged for

a large police presence

CUTHBERT
Do they have to wear uniforms

PENDERGAST
Yes

CUTHBERT
I dont want to scare people

PENDERGAST
I understand But Mr Cuthbert
weve got bigger problems Depending
on what we find today we may have
to shut you down

Cuthbert looks grim
INT PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY LAB - DAY

DAgosta examines the huge centrifuges autoclaves
electrophoresis

apparati monitors computers etc as Margo and Greg Kawakita
look at

the claw

KAWAKITA
What do you make of it Margo

MARGO
Its not mammalian thats for sure
I think its reptilian

PENDERGAST
That would jive with what we got
from the preliminary DNA read-out
Here have a look

He hands them a computer read-out Margo checks it quickly as
Kawakita

looks on

MARGO
According to this twenty-five
percent of the claw DNA is
unidentifiable about a third is
homo sapien and the rest is
Hemidactylus Turcicus

DAGOSTA
(looks over)
Whats that

Margo pulls off her glasses

MARGO
Turkish Gecko I believe A lizard

KAWAKITA
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same
strand Impossible The sample must
be contaminated

MARGO
Theres another possibility A lot
of repeated base pairs could suggest
a high level of genetic damage

PENDERGAST
Genetic damage

MARGO
When DNA is defective it often
uncontrollably replicates long
repeating sequences of the same base
pair Viruses can damage DNA So can
radiation certain chemicals Even
cancer Lets let the GSE sort it
out I have to get started This
will take several hours

PENDERGAST
We need someone to take us to the
secure storage area

KAWAKITA
Try Dr Frock Hes the curator of
Plant Biology All the curators
have keys And he knows every inch
of this museum The rest of us still
get lost

INT MUSEUM HALLWAY AREA - DAY

Pendergast

DAgosta and Dr

corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors

are

numbered up to eight then the corridor turns

As the three go forward

faintly
in the hall

PENDERGAST
Thank you for taking the time to
help us with this Dr Frock

FROCK
Happy to be useful Its rare enough
these days According to security
Beauregard put the Whittlesley
crates in storage area 1012

PENDERGAST
How many storage areas are there

Frock get off are in an older plain

The doors

the creaking of the wheelchair echoes
FROCK

hey fill seven floors We have the
argest collection of mammals and
inosaurs in the world Just to give
ou an idea there are more than

hree million insects specimens Not
o mention amphibians reptiles
irds anthropological artifacts
eteorites minerals and gems Only
bout five percent of the museum
ollection is actually on display

amBOddt¢kK AFH

DAGOSTA
This place is a maze

FROCK
Im one of the few who know every
inch it now that John is gone

PENDERGAST
(looks over)
Do you mean Dr Whittlesley

FROCK
Yes John made quite a study of the
whole museum He had a copy of my
original plans

Frock heads through a double door that leads to a FREIGHT
ELEVATOR

thats as big as a small room The operator KARL has it
decorated

with a table chair and PICTURES

MARGO
Osteo prep Karl

The doors creak closed They are now inside
INT FREIGHT ELEVATOR - DAY

Headed down DAgosta chews on a toothpick stares at Karls
home-made

picture show The photos have all been cut from nature
magazines They

are of ANIMALS MATING in extreme positions and undreamed of ways

DAgosta turns to Pendergast dead pan

DAGOSTA
My kind of art

Karl who is sixty and wears a red toupee leers
KARL
They keep me company Gets kinda
lonely sometimes

DAGOSTA
My favorite is the two camels

KARL
Really Im partial to the skunks

Finally the doors open and they exit to a hail enter another set

of

doors Now they are in

INT OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATION AREA - DAY

It looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything
else

Deep stainless steel tanks line one wall On the ceiling near
the

tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger

carcasses Ina far corner of the workshop is a stainless-steel
gurney

bearing a DEAD GORILLA A pink faced eighty year old man is

working on

the carcass with sharp tools This is DON OSTERBAAN

FROCK
Did you ever wonder where we get all
our skeletons This is the
laboratory where animal carcasses
are reduced to bones
(to Osterbaan)
Whats cooking today Don

DON
Zebra

Frock looks into a large maceration tank with Pendergast and

DAgosta

and

room

A zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface its flesh
soft tissues falling off

DAGOSTA
Man thats ripe

Frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main

Inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox Its
crawling with BLACK BEETLES which are devouring it DAgosta and
Pendergast watch the grizzly scene properly impressed

FROCK
Dermestid beetles The second method
of preparing a skeleton used in
Natural History Museums world wide
Bugs are clean and highly efficient
Theyll polish that fox off in no
time

As Don casually peels back the gorillas whole face exposing the
skull

OSTERBAAN
Want to have a look at a gorilla
brain Got one right here

FROCK
Thanks Don Were in a hurry Some
other time

INT HALLWAY - DAY

More rows of stainless steel doors under hissing steam pipes
The

light is dim here and several bulbs are burned out But the
numbers

on the storage rooms are much higher now The three men come out
of

the darkness Frock rounds a last corner and wheels to a stop

FROCK
This should be it Can you read the
number

Pendergast reaches up above them and TAPS THE LIGHT BULB It
comes on

and they all see the heavy steel door of the storage area
DAgostas

jaw drops and his toothpick falls out The door has been scored
from

top to bottom by long vicious CLAWS

DAGOSTA
Holy shit

Frock stares in amazement shaken He runs a finger down the
deep
ruts

FROCK
Something tried to get into this
room

PENDERGAST
And failed These doors are solid
steel

FROCK

This means there must be an animal
loose in the museum

PENDERGAST
I wouldnt be so sure

Pendergast takes Frocks keys and opens the door It swings wide

on
oiled hinges DAgosta turns on a light
INT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT
They all enter Nothing has been disturbed The crates sit in
the

middle of the small room untouched Pendergast kneels by the
only one
thats been opened

PENDERGAST
This must be the one that held the
statue Lets see what else is
inside

Pendergast removes the lid and hands it to DAgosta pulls out a
BLOW

DART GUN SEED PODS a CARVED STONE DAgosta takes the lid and
turns

it

DAGOSTA
The lid of this crate is scratched
with claw marks just like the door

As DAgosta studies the lid a brittle water damaged envelope
slips

out DAgosta picks it up The envelope bears an imprint of TWO

ARROWS one silver overlaid with another of GOLD

DAGOSTA
Look Its some kind of letter

FROCK
(excited)
May I see that
DAgosta hands the letter to Frock

FROCK
Its from John Those two arrows
were his insignia Its addressed to
Louis Moriarty a patron who
financed his expeditions

PENDERGAST
Read it out loud

FROCK
Dear Louis
Tomorrow we go to the south
end of the tepui where well be in
the greatest danger so Im sending
Carlos back with the crates You
always believed in me Louis even
in the darkest days So it gives me
great pleasure to tell you your
faith has been rewarded Weve made
an incredible find I enclose a
representation of Mbwun Note the
exaggerated claws the reptilian
attributes the hints of bipedalia
Its beyond belief but this statue
is accurate I know because Ive
seen the beast

Frock stops looks up at DAgosta and Pendergast His face
flushes
with the thrill

FROCK
Did you hear that My God He says
that Mbwun is real

DAGOSTA
(snorts)
Pardon my French but bull shit

FROCK
This on top of the scratches isnt
it proof

PENDERGAST
I think the scratches were put there
to scare us Perhaps even lead us to

this note

Pendergast looks out to the dark corridors
dock

while

PENDERGAST
You said John Whittlesley made a
study of your blueprints of the
museum

FROCK
Yes

PENDERGAST
Are there any hidden rooms or
staircases Places where someone
could hide

FROCK
Not really Just the sub-basement

DAgosta and Pendergast exchange a look

EXT MUSEUM SIDE DOOR - DAY

A series of boxes labeled

A

small moving van partially loaded with the contents of Frocks
sits waiting Frock delves through one of the boxes

office

PENDERGAST
Where is that

FROCK
I dont know It was walled over No
ones been down there in years

PENDERGAST
You said you had plans of the
museum Could we see them please

Pendergast and DAgosta look on

FROCK
I know theyre here somewhere Its
a good thing we caught the movers in
time Theyre nineteen century
blueprints from when the museum was
built I remember the sub-basement
was below the regular basement
linked to the city sewer I only
know about it because it flooded all
the way up to the museum during the
hurricane of 49 I lost so many
precious books

PROFESSOR FROCK sit on the loading
left

of

some

Frock continues to unload boxes scattering things right and
Its the most amazing assortment of paraphernalia A collection
wildflowers soil samples a stuffed owl Finally he pulls out
very old blueprints and flashes a triumphant smile
FROCK

Eureka Who says it doesnt pay to

be a pack rat Now please be careful

with these When youre done Id

like them back
INT HALL OF THE AFRICAN MAMMALS - DAY

Visitors scatter as Pendergast enters with DAgosta TWO

DEPUTIES a

dog handler JONATHAN HAMM and Jonathans pair of HUGE

BLOODHOUNDS

down

area

The deputies are armed with large shotguns Pendergast scans the
blueprints as they walk

DAGOSTA
How big is the sub-basement

PENDERGAST
Apparently its huge

DAGOSTA
I think I should come with you

PENDERGAST
We havent got time You have to
meet with museum security so we can
make a decision about tonight
INT MUSEUM - STAIRCASE - DAY

Pendergast Jonathan his dogs and the deputies make their way
an

industrial set of stairs into the basement

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

In a moment they arrive at the site of Beauregards murder The

at the bottom of the spiral stairway is still littered with

chalk

crime tape spray paint and the remains of scores of people

tramping

in and out
PENDERGAST
These plans indicate theres a
walled over entrance to the sub-
basement right around here

They move carefully down the dark corridor which we remember from

the
time we last saw it with Henry and Larry Unknown to Jonathan or
Pendergast the dogs are walking directly towards the spot where
the
boys faced the monster
JONATHAN
The dogs are picking up something
Mr Pendergast
The dogs start barking in animation sniffing the wall
Pendergast
studies the blueprints with a flashlight moves to the spot
Theres
nothing to be seen He shines his flashlight over the water-
stained
uneven stucco between two steel beams The dogs sniff furiously
at the

point where the wall meets the floor Pendergast moves his

fingers to

the

their

inky

Two

the joint between the stucco and the beam shoves hard The wall
pushes back Its a door

INT STAIRWELL - SUB-BASEMENT - DAY
They enter a dank stairwell with brick stairs Water drips on
walls

DEPUTY ONE
What is this A dungeon

Jonathan looks uneasy double wraps the dogs leashes around his
black-gloved hands The two deputies remove their 12 gauges from

shoulders Then they all follow the animals descend down the
stairwell

INT SECURITY COMMAND CENTER - MUSEUM - DAY

The place looks like the control room of a nuclear power plant

SECURITY GUARDS monitor a battery of closed-circuit screens

DAgosta
is now accompanied by the pompous head of security

Clearly

IPPOLITO

Ippolito feels DAgosta is pissing on his territory and hes

trying to
assert control

IPPOLITO
This huge police presence tonight
isnt necessary Lieutenant Youll
just scare people off I can handle
the security behind scenes with this
system Its state of the art

DAGOSTA

The cops are non-negotiable
Ippolito Why dont you just tell me
how this space station works

IPPOLITO
Its fool proof basically I
designed this whole thing myself
Every valuable object in the Museum
carries a small electronic chip If
anythings moved so much as an inch
we get an alarm pinpointing the
exact location of the attempted
theft

DAGOSTA
Thats great if youre stopping a
burglar Not our goal here Are
there motion detectors

IPPOLITO
In every exhibition room The
museums divided into five cells
The reception and exhibit are in
cell five We could arm the motion
detectors in cells one to four then
seal the perimeter with our fire
doors

DAGOSTA
That would leave one exit for
hundreds of people Youd be
violating every fire regulation on
the books Well guard the perimeter
with my men and engage the motion
detectors in the other cells One
more question I see a big hole If
this entire thing is run by
computer what happens if the power
fails

IPPOLITO
(snorts)
You dont know much about computers
Lieutenant There are safeguards
built in We have back-up systems
with redundancies Theres no way
these computers can fail

INT PHYSICAL ANTHRO LAB - DAY
Margo Kawakita and Frock are studying the contents of the crate

FROCK
I cant help thinking theres
something that Pendergast
overlooked If the scratches were
made by whatever killed Beauregard
it wants something thats in here

MARGO
A blow dart Seed pods A plant
press Pretty unimpressive stuff
FROCK

Let me see the plant press
Frock opens the plant press and sees a specimen inside

MARGO
What is it

FROCK
Im not sure As you know the
Kothoga lived outside civilization
on the tepui for thousands of years
Species flourished in isolation when
man and pollution rendered them
extinct This could be one of the
last remaining samples of an unknown
plant

MARGO
Whatever it is it must be common on
the tepui John used it as packing
material

FROCK
Youre right

Kawakita lifts out a bit of the fibers as does Frock
FROCK
Theyre curiously fleshy

KAWAKITA
And they smell delicious

Kawakita TAKES a NIBBLE

KAWAKITA
Taste great

FROCK
I wouldnt put that in your mouth
until we do a chemical analysis
Greg

KAWAKITA
I can handle that for you while
were waiting on the GSE

Kawakita rises and exits with some of the plant

MARGO
What about those seed pods Are they
from the same plant

Frock takes a moment to study them looks up

FROCK
Margo these arent seed pods

MARGO
What are they

FROCK
Theyre eggs

INT SUB-BASEMENT - DAY

Black as night The only light comes from the mens flashlights

Theyre at a crossroads Crooked corridors with arched ceilings

barely the height of a man stretch in several directions
Jonathan is

crouched down resting with the panting dogs The deputies are
having

a smoke They all look both uneasy and exhausted except for

Pendergast He stares at the blueprints

PENDERGAST
Hard to read in this light The ink
is so faded
JONATHAN
The dogs have lost the scent Mr
Pendergast Maybe we should head

back

PENDERGAST
Not yet Lets try the fork to the
left

The men reluctantly shoulder their shotguns and push on The
hounds

walk ahead carelessly nosing the ground The flashlight beams

illuminate lime-encrusted cave-like walls

DEPUTY TWO
This place gives me the creeps

At this the dogs begin to WHINE The HAIR on their backs rises
ina
ridge Pendergast turns as a BREEZE stirs his clothes

JONATHAN
Theyve got something

PENDERGAST
Keep the light up I cant see

The dogs strain and pull forward sniffing the air ahead The
deputies

raise up their shotguns as they all move deeper into the
darkness The

flashlight beams streak crazily in all directions barely
penetrating

the gloom Suddenly the dogs break into a terrifying BAYING
which

bounces off the walls

PENDERGAST
Shut them up

JONATHAN
Heel Argo Hobbes Heel

The dogs drag Jonathan forward paying no attention foaming at
the
mouth Jonathan is now frightened

JONATHAN
Theyre going crazy I need help
Too late As Jonathan tries to grab the collars one of the dogs
LEAPS
forward and the leash slips through Jonathans hands

JONATHAN
Hes loose Argo

Argo BOLTS into the darkness The men start after the dog
following

the frantic barking which echoes farther and farther in the
distance

Pendergast is in the lead Suddenly he throws out his arms
halts

PENDERGAST
Stop

JONATHAN
Holy mother what is that

A goatish odor envelops them all

DEPUTY ONE
Smells God-awful Like rotten meat

JONATHAN
Argo Come

PENDERGAST
Quiet

A SCUFFLING sound of claws dragging on brick is heard followed by

a
ROAR The men all freeze The other dog leaps and twists with
excitement In the confusion it also breaks free It tears

after the

first dog disappearing into the darkness Now Jonathan is wild-
eyed

JONATHAN
No Hobbes

The deputies are terrified retreat The darkness is stifling

claustrophobic The flashlights are small help Pendergast
alone

remains dead calm His voice is cool and commanding

PENDERGAST
Forget the dogs You two get back
here Dont point that gun at me
The deputies regain control and follow Pendergasts orders They
fall

into position pump their shotguns and aim them down the hall
In the

echoing darkness ahead of them the barking falters and stops

There is a moment of silence then a terrible unearthly SHRIEK
The

deputies quail frozen in their tracks Jonathan leaps forward

JONATHAN
Argo Hobbes

PENDERGAST
Get back Now

At that moment a SHAPE hurtles at them from the darkness The
men YELL

in terror There are two stunning BLASTS from the shotguns two

FLASHES of light accompanied by a deafening roar The rumble
echoes

and dies and theres an intense silence followed by a sob

JONATHAN
You shot my dog

Hobbes lies five feet from them a black shadow of death
Jonathan

kneels by the dog tears in his eyes Down the animals side is a
GASH

JONATHAN
My dog
DEPUTY ONE
(stammers)

He was coming right at me

In the distance they can hear a terrified howl Its the second
dog
hurt or frightened Its a pitiful sound

DEPUTY TWO
Lets get out of here

JONATHAN
Im not going anywhere Not without
my dog

Pendergast grabs at Jonathan who slips from his grasp Jonathan
inches

back down the hallway calling desperately
JONATHAN
Hobbes

DEPUTY ONE
Get back

Jonathan shakes his head no

JONATHAN
Theres something out there Lets
go get it now Thats why we came
down here isnt it

PENDERGAST
(to the deputies)
Hes right Follow me

But the two deputies are terrified They cling to the wall
inching
backwards sheer horror in their eyes

DEPUTY ONE
No way I say we get help A lot
more guns

PENDERGAST
Im ordering you Cover me

DEPUTY TWO
Well cover you from here

Jonathan is disappearing in front of them Pendergast has no
choice

Grim faced he pulls his Colt 45 Anaconda from a shoulder
harness

Its a narrow and evil-looking gun From a pocket comes a
handful of

255 grain wadcutter and 147 grain FMJ flatnose ammunition He
loads

up goes after Jonathan whos no longer in sight Pendergast
passes

down a long sloping hallway into cavernous blackness ahead At
the

bottom Pendergast stops He has to stoop down as he goes through
an

archway and into
A VAST ARCHING ROOM

A dark stream of water runs between concrete walls with tunnels
going
off from all sides It appears to be part of the sewer system

The dog

cowers in a corner Jonathan moves to his side

JONATHAN
Look Its Hobbes Hes all right

PENDERGAST
Come on Lets get back to the
others We cant leave them alone

JONATHAN
Its alright I can tell by the way
the dogs acting that whatever was
out there is gone What is this
place

PENDERGAST
Not on the map Looks like it
connects with the city sewer

Pendergast calls back down the tunnel for the deputies

PENDERGAST
Were coming back

The words go unanswered From the hall comes a loud REPORT

Its the

shotguns blasting desperately Something flies up all around
them as

the sound echoes BATS

Pendergast and Jonathan shield themselves from the flurry of
beating

wings Finally the animals settle and Pendergast and Jonathan
exchange

a look The silence is filled by a soft RUMBLING SOUND They
stand

together waiting Pendergast points his gun at the hall leading
back

to the deputies A ridge of hair on the dogs back rises and it

growls

PENDERGAST
Identify yourself Whos there

No answer The rumbling continues growing louder Then a dark
object

appears It comes rolling out of the hallway bounces in front
of them

and stops Pendergast shines his light on
DEPUTY ONES HEAD The mouth is open wide in terror Across the
cheek
is a vicious claw mark

JONATHAN
Oh my God

PENDERGAST
(hisses)
Quiet

And now they hear a GUT WRENCHING SHRIEK thats abruptly cut off

followed by a second rumbling sound Jonathan grabs Pendergast
by the

shirt panicked

PENDERGAST
Stay calm

They head quietly for the exit at the other end of room which
seems to
slope up After theyre gone a few moments the head of DEPUTY

TWO

rolls to a stop

EXT MUSEUM - NIGHT

Cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance A huge
rotating

SPOTLIGHT is now turned on Elegantly dressed men in dinner
jackets

and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain umbrellas

Jousting

INT CUTHBERTS OFFICE - EVENING

Cuthberts putting on his tux He adjusts the cummerbund
humming

happily as DAgosta looks on DAgosta paces highly agitated
and

worried

DAGOSTA
Im telling you somethings wrong
I still havent heard from
Pendergast I think you should call
it off

CUTHBERT
Its too late now Guests are
arriving The Mayors car is pulling
up
DAGOSTA
Ill go down and speak to him

CUTHBERT
(irritated)
You havent got the authority Only
Pendergast can pull the plug

DAGOSTA
Pendergast may be in trouble Dont
you understand He still hasnt come
back Its been over three hours --

CUTHBERT
Hell be back Relax Were in good
shape Your security is air tight
Thereve been no more incidents
nothing suspicious Theres no
reason to call off the opening now

INT GREAT ROTUNDA - NIGHT
Resounding with the echoes of several hundred expensive shoes

crossing
the marble expanse and heading down the rows of palm trees

leading to

the Hall of Heavens The palms themselves are festooned with
orchids

and violet lights Somewhere inside an invisible band is
playing New

York New York An army of waiters in white tie thread their
way

through the guests carrying large silver platters crowded with

champagne glasses Cuthbert enters and crosses to meet The MAYOR
and

THE MAYORS WIFE Photographers step forward and flashbulbs pop

INT HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

Food is out Hundreds of tables are set with black linen table
cloths

Decorations have a dark haunted house theme A hum of activity
floats

up past the vast Corinthian columns into the circular dome above

INT MARGOS LABORATORIES - NIGHT

An explosive sneeze rattles the beakers and dislodges the plant

specimens Margo interrupts her work at the computer to hand
Greg a

tissue as Frock looks on
KAWAKITA
What kind of egg is it

MARGO
Its reptilian

FROCK
Like the claw

MARGO
(cautious)
Lets not jump to conclusions This
egg could belong to any number of
reptiles Dr Frock

FROCK

(excited)
Come on Margo Were on the verge
of something huge Lets consider
the possibility just the three of
us alone in this room What if John
was right I mean what if And he
sent back an egg of his monster in
the crates When it got to the
museum it hatched

MARGO
Several problems with that theory
For one thing this egg is intact
For another according to
Pendergast the crates were shipped
here on a boat Everyone on board
was killed like Beauregard If the
thing hatched in mid-ocean where
did it go

Frock has no answer Greg gestures to his computer screen

KAWAKITA
I guess youre not interested in
this plant anymore but the chemical
analysis is done Frock reads the
computer over Gregs shoulder

FROCK
Genus Unknown Family Unknown
Order Unknown Phylum Unknown
Cripes Margo what did you give me
Is this an animal or one funky
shrub
(to Kawakita)
I see youve been programming the
computer vocabulary again

MARGO
(points to a hexagonal symbol)
Look at this An ambyloid reovirus
protein That explains why the
computers confused The plants
infected with a virus

FROCK
Thats not so unusual Many plants
carry viruses Like the burls on

Maple trees

MARGO

But a virus normally codes for other
viruses This ones making human and
animal proteins Listen to this

(reads)
Glycotetraglycine collagenoid
Weinsteins tropic hormone 4-
monoxytocin supressin hormone

KAWAKITA
These plant fibers are loaded with
hormones

MARGO

What kind of hormones

Kawakita pulls a heavy book from the shelf The Encyclopedia of
Biochemistry thumbs to a page and reads

KAWAKITA
4-monoxytocin is A hormone
secreted by the human hypothalamus
gland

MARGO

Try Weinsteins tropic hormone

The tension is rising in the room Frock takes the book looks
this
one up reads silently and removes his glasses
FROCK
A hormone secreted by the human

thalamus gland

Kawakita and Frock look puzzled Margo rises in agitation
MARGO
This is it This is what he or
it is after The plant has high
concentrations of the same hormones
found in minute quantities in the
human brain

KAWAKITA
So what

MARGO
Pendergast told me the killer
extracts and eats the hypothalamus
and thalamus of the victims brains

KAWAKITA
(pales)
Eats them

MARGO
Yes Whatever killed Beauregard may
have lived on this plant When the
crates were put in secure storage
they were out of reach The killer
couldnt get them so it got the
next best thing

FROCK
Beauregards head

Theres a moment of stunned silence Then a LOUD BUZZER makes
them all
jump

MARGO
Its all right That means the
GSE has finished analyzing the
claw DNA Greg you go find
Pendergast and Lieutenant DAgosta
now

INT MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT

Kawakita tears up the dark stairs He turns a corner and
something
JUMPS OUT at him He almost screams Its a DRUNK

DRUNK
Hey where za little boys room

KAWAKITA
Down that hallway But dont stay
long You dont want to be here
alone

INT MARGOS LAB - NIGHT

Margo and Frock enter and huddle over a sheaf of papers that the
printer has spit out

MARGO

All right assuming the program is
accurate this is a description of
the animal with that claw

(she reads)

INT ENTRANCE TO SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - ROTUNDA - NIGHT

The crowd is now packed into the rotunda as the MAYOR cuts a red

ribbon across the entrance to the exhibit and everyone applauds

Cuthbert is by the mayors side He steps forward and raises his
hand

for quiet The crowd falls silent

CUTHBERT
Thank you everyone and welcome
Were glad all of you were willing
to brave the inclement weather to be
with us tonight Our special thanks
to his honor the mayor and his
lovely wife

The Mayor takes a bow More applause

CUTHBERT (CONT)

Some people have questioned whether
a superstition exhibit belongs ina
Museum of Science Spells
incantations demons magic these
are forces that defy the natural
laws Superstition provides answers
to the great questions based on
fear Science provides answers to
the great questions based on truth
Science and superstition then are
polar opposites Mortal enemies if
you will And that is why we are
here tonight We have come to learn
more about the enemy and thus to
bring about its defeat For every
good there is an evil for every
dark a light And so tonight my
friends I give you ignorance
terror unreasoning fear pure evil

The crush

Officer McNitt stands in the corner of the computer room bathed

neon light Running the security system is GEORGE your basic

nerd Multiple screens all over show various rooms in the
museum Most

these the crowds can be seen entering the various rooms McNitt

his walkie talkie

MCNITT

MCNITT

At this moment a NOISE comes from the adjoining room McNitts

SWIVELS Its a LOUD THUMP

MCNITT
Hold on Lieutenant
(to George)
What was that

GEORGE
Probably just something wrong with
the air conditioning Theres a shit
load of electrical rooms back there

George is playing an elaborate computer game and not paying
attention

McNitt returns to his walkie talkie as the THUMP comes again
Now he

looks distinctly nervous

MCNITT
Lieutenant Theres something wrong

DAGOSTA (ON RADIO)

McNitt watches uneasily as George opens the door disappears into
the

next room

DAgosta turns to Kawakita who waits shifting from foot to foot

DAGOSTA

DAgosta heads into the exhibit before Kawakita can protest

INT SUPERSTITION EXHIBIT - NIGHT
We see various cuts of people as they move into the different
rooms A

TEENAGE GIRL (LAUREN) and her FATHER (DAVID) examine a lidless

rotting European style coffin complete with corpse A white
haired

gentleman (DR POUND) leans on his cane as he looks at a display
on

primitive medicine practiced with implements that look like
torture

tools

Cuthbert and Ippolito are at the head of a press of people
giving the
MAYOR and HIS WIFE a guided tour

CUTHBERT
Here we have a very rare sacrificial
table from Mesoamerica The priests
would kill the victim on this slab
cut out the heart and eat it while
it was still beating

MAYOR
I could use one of these things in
City Hall

Cuthbert laughs right on cue They pass a Congo power figure
with its

bulging eye sockets and torso riddled with sharp nails Several
people

recoil from it looking repulsed The MAYORs WIFE sees it and
looks

distressed

MAYORS WIFE
Youre letting kids see this I
should think theyd have nightmares

CUTHBERT
Kid will love it Theyre our target
audience Nothing here is as violent
as what they see on TV

They pass a MUMMY dripping in BLOOD The Mayor gestures to it

MAYOR
I dont know That could be a little
over the top Its not even
scientific Mummies dont bleed

Cuthberts smile fades as he sees the mummy
CLOSE ON the MAYORS WHITE CUFF as he extends his hand to
point at

the mummy The pristine white of his cuff is suddenly colored by
a

falling RED DROP OF BLOOD

Cuthbert sees it So does the Mayor and Ippolito They look up
as

another DROP OF BLOOD falls right on Cuthberts face And yet
another

droplet falls on THE MAYORS WIFES white bosom exposed by her

low
cut dress
CUTHBERT
Oh my God
THEIR POV above the mummys head the top of the case is cut
away

exposing a ceiling crawling with steam pipes and ductwork A
hand a

watch and the cuff of a blue shirt protrude over the edge of the

case A small icicle of blood hangs from the middle finger And

another drop FALLS

CUTHBERT SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS Conscious of the panic
factor Ippolito yells

IPPOLITO
Quiet everyone

But its too late The room is packed with people And DAgosta
himself is just pushing through the door as another woman cries
out

WOMAN
Theres a body up there

A ripple of fear goes over the faces in the room titters as
people

wonder if its a joke At that moment from the darkness above
the

ceiling buckles and something FALLS

Its OFFICER DOYLES HEADLESS TORSO dripping blood

UTTER PANDEMONIUM breaks loose The close space ECHOES with
screams

and shouts People claw at each other stumbling desperately
trying to

get to the door A YOUNG WOMAN falls and DAgosta runs to her to
keep
her from being trampled in the stampede
INT COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

McNitt is staring in horror at the remote camera images showing
the

chaos in the exhibition the faces registering blind fear
Alarms

start going off all over the place McNitt calls out
panicked

MCNITT
George Get out here now

McNitt looks around desperate But George still isnt here
The door

to the electrical room is still open The ceiling shudders from

thundering feet McNitt can hear distant SCREAMS Its raising
the

hair on the back of his neck He calls out

MCNITT
George Where are you

No answer He moves to the open door a new fear in his eyes
He looks
inside

INT ELECTRICAL ROOM - NIGHT

BLACKNESS McNitt cant find a light switch He stays in the
doorway

silhouetted by light from the computer room With shaking hands
McNitt

pumps a slug into the chamber of his shotgun Theres a strange
low

gurgling sound Its McNitts stomach He silences it
swallows

MCNITT
Hey you George Damn it Where are
you No response

McNitt edges into the darkened rooms The first ones empty He
tries
the next

MCNITT
George Weve got an emergency Are
you here
Suddenly theres a HUGE THUMP and a scuttling to his left Its
a

terrifying sound McNitt drops to his knees and pumps three
rounds

each with a light and a deafening blast A SHOWER OF SPARKS and
a gout

of flame licks upwards illuminating the room with orange light
A

HUGE DARK SHAPE ducks out the door

MCNITT
Oh God Oh God

Gunpowder hangs in the air like a blue fog On the far wall a
mounted

metal box is smoking from three large ragged holes With a
sudden

pop an electrical arc slices across the ruined box followed by
a

crackling and a shower of sparks McNitt ducks back into the
computer

room Slams the door and locks it breathing hard

INT COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

Every single screen flickers and dims But to McNitts relief
George

has returned He is sitting with his back to the doorway in his
chair

MCNITT
George I saw something in there I
fired but I think I missed it

George remains still his back to McNitt staring at the computer
game
on the flickering screen

MCNITT

INT HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

Everyone pours out of the exhibit running for the door leading
to the

Rotunda People are getting trampled Its a terrible crush
Screams

Tables over-turned everywhere Food scatters to the floor
DAGOSTA

pushes his way out of the exhibit crosses to Kawakita who is

appalled Above the chandeliers are flickering

KAWAKITA
What happened

DAGOSTA
Theres a dead body in the exhibit
People are panicking trampling each
other trying to get out

Ippolito runs over to join them

DAGOSTA
What the hell is going on

Above them THE LIGHTS dim again and come back on

IPPOLITO
The whole system is shutting down
We have to get out quickly before
the fire doors fall

DAGOSTA
What doors

IPPOLITO
I told you They seal off all the
cells They were designed to fall
automatically in a system failure --

DAGOSTA
You said the system couldnt fail

At this theres a low rumble from above DAgosta looks up and
sees A

LARGE METAL DOOR IS DESCENDING from a slot in the ceiling and
not in

an orderly fashion Its falling fast Below are crowds of
people all

pushing to get out Officer Bailey near the door sees it

BAILEY
Above you Look out
His voice is lost in an ocean of screaming Kawakita stands in
total

horror a moment then joins Bailey and DAgosta

All of them try to restrain people from trying to beat the door
Ippolito on the other hand elbows his way to the front of the
fleeing crowd

DAGOSTA
Ippolito Get back here

IPPOLITO
Like hell

Ignoring DAgosta Ippolito pushes past He barrels over an OLD
MAN

who stumbles and falls DIRECTLY BENEATH THE FALLING DOOR
Ippolito
jumps over him and is out

The old man looks up at the descending wall of steel and SCREAMS
DAGOSTA runs forward dives for the old man but hes not in
time

Kawakita covers his eyes unable to watch as the lights flicker a
third and last time The room is plunged into darkness And
over the

screams we hear the rumble and CRASH the horrifying cries of the
old

man as the door comes down

INT MARGOS LAB - NIGHT

Margo and Frock stand in the darkness Through a high window we
can

see lightning flash

MARGO
Whats going on

FROCK
Some kind of power failure Maybe

flashlight

MARGO
I think so

She gets one from a cupboard

FROCK
Gregs been gone over a half hour

INT HALLWAYS - NIGHT

Frock wheels his chair as fast as he can Margo runs beside him

carrying the crate with the fibers inside A peel of thunder
ends and

distant screaming is heard Margo stops appalled

MARGO
Dr Frock Did you hear that

FROCK
Dont stop now

Up ahead they hear METALLIC RUMBLING and a CRASH They round a
corner
and come up against a huge STEEL DOOR

MARGO
Whats that

FROCK

Lord Margo Were trapped

INT BASEMENT - NIGHT

Pendergast stands at the end of a cul de sac studying the blue
prints

by a stone wall Jonathan and the dog are with him exhausted
and

terrified Jonathan keeps an eye on the corridor behind them as

Pendergast works

PENDERGAST
I know where we are now Were
getting out Jonathan This should
be another door

Taking a pen knife from his pocket Pendergast places it into the

plaster and gently twists the blade A piece of plaster the size
ofa

dinner plate falls revealing the tracings of another doorway

Pendergast shoves the door open to reveal a dark dusty room

JONATHAN
Hallelujah Pendergast Where the
hell are we now
INT ALCOHOLIC ROOM - NIGHT

Jonathan and Pendergast enter quickly from the hidden rear door

Pendergast shines his beam on dusty shelves filled with
specimens All

are stored in jars of alcohol There are fetuses of many
different

species We see a pig a cow a duck billed platypus as well as
brain

sections a disembodied monkey head One rectangular glass
container

holds a skinned human foot

JONATHAN
Jesus what is this

PENDERGAST
Another storage room

Pendergast tries the light switch to no effect

PENDERGAST
Somethings happened The powers
out

They cross the room to the main door and exit Now theyre in
INT OSTEO PREP - LAB - NIGHT

Pendergast shines his light on the maceration tanks The humming
of
the bugs can be heard in their cabinet

PENDERGAST
All right I know where we are This
is the osteo prep lab I was in here
earlier Were safe now

With these words the dog GROWLS Jonathan freezes and sniffs
the air

JONATHAN
Oh no I smell it

PENDERGAST
Keep the animal quiet

Jonathan kneels by Hobbes as Pendergast listens every nerve on
end A

sound comes from the adjacent hallway that leads to the secure
storage
area Its unmistakable HEAVY BREATHING and the creeping
movement of
claws Pendergast lifts his gun

PENDERGAST

Go out the other doorway Theres a
stair at the end of the hall Up
five flights is a corridor that
leads to the Hall of the Heavens
Find Lieutenant DAgosta Bring
help

Jonathan doesnt have to be told twice He takes the dog and
exits

from the other side of the lab leaving Pendergast alone
Pendergast

waits a moment until Jonathans safely out of sight He switches
off

his flashlight backs up slowly step by step He opens the door
to

the alcoholics storage As he slips inside a DARK SHAPE appears

INT ALCOHOLICS STORAGE - NIGHT

Slowly making no sound Pendergast lifts the 45 Anaconda
passes his

finger over the cylinder checking the loaded chambers Then he

steadies the revolver and levels it at the door The hideous
pickled

specimens seem to hover all around him The smell is
overwhelming and

the snuffling is louder now

Its coming closer After a long moment there is a faint bump at
the

door This is followed by a low scratching noise Pendergast
watches

frozen in horror holding his breath

THE DOORKNOB BEGINS TO TURN Not knowing what else to do
Pendergast
simply grabs it from the inside and holds on

OUTSIDE he hears an AMUSED SNORT then a LOW GROWL Theres ONE
HARD

HIT and the door shivers THE DOORKNOB FALLS OFF Its over
now

Pendergast kneels down bracing the gun in both hands From this

position he can see right through the hole where the doorknob
fell

His mouth literally drops in astonishment as he sees
a HUGE red-rimmed GREEN EYE

Involuntarily Pendergast LEAPS BACK nearly falls and drops the
gun

Beakers crash around him He scrambles in the darkness The
flashlight

falls and pops back on The beam streaks up crazily Its
chaos

Pendergast is an easy target now He grabs for the light the
gun

steadies himself breathing fast and low His heart pounds But

nothing more happens The silence is heavy The eye is gone
And

suddenly Pendergast understands

In the distance he can hear HUMAN VOICES and a rolling
wheelchair

Somewhere nearby are MARGO AND FROCK The monster has left him
to get

bigger game Fear for Margo and Frock lights Pendergasts eyes
All

panic and disorganization are gone He holds his revolver at 12

oclock and KICKS the door open leaps out as

A HUGE DARK SHAPE DARTS FROM THE ROOM Its headed for the
secure

storage areas again Pendergast takes off Not knowing how else
to

address this thing he finds himself calling

PENDERGAST
Halt

INT SECURE STORAGE HALLWAY - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Pendergast runs into the hallway but hes already too late The
hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed

ON PENDERGAST as he levels his gun and shoots

THE CREATURE stops rears back on its haunches looks once at

Pendergast pissed As the VOICES around the far corner fall
silent

Pendergast FIRES The shot blasts off a piece of the wall

With astonishing speed and agility for its bulk the beast turns
and
leaps around the corner passing out of Pendergasts sight

PENDERGAST
Margo Frock Its coming Run
AROUND THE CORNER

Are MARGO AND FROCK Frock holds the keys to secure storage
area 1012

in his hand Margo has the flashlight and the crate with the
fibers

They can hear the sound of thundering movement

FROCK
Look

Margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast
Its

descending like a freight train One split second of sheer
amazement

then

MARGO
Dr Frock Quick

Frock immobilized in his wheel chair stares at the monster
like a

trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk Margo grabs his
keys from

him fumbles desperately to open the door It swings wide at
last She

grabs the handles of the wheelchair tugs with all her might
The

wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn

thing inside

INT SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT

Margo shoves Frock behind her slams the door shut Seconds
later the

beast throws itself against the storage door They hear it
outside

growling in fury claws lashing out Margo and Frock press back
in the

darkness terror in their eyes

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway his gun drawn
his

flashlight on A few more steps and he holds hard His eyes go
wide in

astonishment as his light illuminates the beast Its tearing at
the

steel door furiously with incredible force
As the flashlight beam hits it MBWUN roars and looks up Now we
see

it clearly for the first time The monster is MASSIVE putrid
rank

Slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red A ridge of stiff
black

hair rises on the creatures buffalo-like humped back The
withers are

muscled and covered with plates A forked TONGUE licks out as
purple

lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth The claws raise up to
fend

off the light

PENDERGAST steadies himself with difficulty takes a few seconds

to
aim with the greatest care Mbwun makes a move towards him and

he

squeezes the trigger hard The gun echoes in the hall A split
second

and a white streak moves right up the beasts cranium A direct

hit
The shot echoes and Mbwun drops its claws

The flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the
beasts eyes Angry and blinded the creature turns and ina

moment
lopes off Pendergast watches unimaginably relieved Realizing

what
just happened his knees start to buckle He catches himself

wipes
one hand across his eyes A voice comes from the storage room

MARGO (OS)
Pendergast Are you all right

PENDERGAST
No I think Im hallucinating

The storage door opens slowly and Margo looks out

MARGO
Youre not Where is it

PENDERGAST
(shakes his head)
Gone
MARGO
Wounded

PENDERGAST
No A chromium alloy tipped 45
caliber bullet bounced off that
things skull like a spit ball I
think it was bothered by my light

MARGO
That would fit Its nocturnal
Quick Come inside

EXT MUSEUM - NIGHT

As hundreds of the guests emerge into the pounding rain
crying

terrified unclear what exactly happened These are the lucky
ones

Among them we find IPPOLITO His walkie talkie is squawking
The

windows of the museum behind him are black

DAGOSTA ON RADIO
Ippolito Where the hell are you
Were trapped in here We need help

Ippolito sits down on the steps in the rain knowing the extent
of

what hes done The wheels are working hard now trying to
figure out

damage control The walkie talkie keeps calling He doesnt
respond

INT HALL OF THE HEAVENS - NIGHT

Tables are overturned food lies on the ground people cower in
the

darkness DAgosta crouches in some broken glass with his walkie

talkie He shuts it off rises looks around Light comes from
a few

sputtering candles

Most of the guests still trapped inside are grouped around the
lowered
steel door Among them are KAWAKITA and CUTHBERT From the BODY
of the
man crushed underneath the door extends a large puddle of blood
Bailey is working in desperation on a brass panel by the door

Five flights down We were lost in

DAgosta makes a quick sweep of the room with his flashlight
The

remote corners of the hall are so black the light seems to
disappear

In the center two men are bending over a still form One of
them is

DAgosta heads down the stairs in the lead with Bailey close
behind

The stairwell is windowless and dark DAgosta shines his light
and it

cuts into the blackness He moves quietly makes the first
landing and

stops Bailey watches his back from several steps behind as

signals for him to wait The flashlight flares into a glass door

man

Its lunging up and down with odd jerking motions The man is
long

past making a sound From the monster comes a faint crunching
and

slobbering Jonathan rises comes to DAgosta So does Frank
They

corner
and disappear from sight

INT SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

Ippolito finds Waters and the others staring at him Humiliated
he
swallows hard

IPPOLITO

designed to retard cutting We can

INT HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

Its very dark The huge shape of MBWUN can barely be seen
sliding out

of the stairwell and into the Hall of the Asian Peoples Then
DIM RED
HALL LIGHTS come on in the corners of the ceiling The monster
utters

a low growl The emergency generators are beginning to come on
The

animal lopes to the spot where we last saw DAgosta and his
group

sniffs the ground It looks up and with a curiously human
gesture

cocks its massive head

The silence is broken by VOICES Theyre in the distance and
muffled

but definitely there The monster crouches eagerly lopes
forward with

great stealth The voices are getting louder We follow as it

goes

through the hall and down

A STAIRWELL At the bottom Mbwun quickly turns a corner The
voices

have stopped Mbwun creeps forward enters

INT HALL OF MARINE ANIMALS - NIGHT

A huge room several stories high A WHALE hangs suspended from
the

ceiling Dioramas of fish line all the walls Mbwun pauses next
toa

diorama of the gentle vegetarian sea cow THE MANATEE The two
make a

startling contrast

A pause and then the voices are heard again much louder now
The

source is right around the edge of the Manatee display Mbwun
LEAPS

FORWARD claws lashing out He turns the corner and crashes
through a

wall of GLASS as he grabs at the source of the voices

A display of small extraordinarily life-like TALKING HOLOGRAMS

Theyve been re-activated with the emergency power system Each
little

talking figure is no more then five inches high They move
around a

small three dimensional display of marine animals explaining the
lung

systems of fish

MBWUN stands in the pile of broken glass stares at the
holograms
mesmerized He makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a
CHUCKLE

Then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to
touch

one of the holograms But the shadowy creatures cant be caught
The

beast seems to realize this SNORTS and moves off As he goes he

passes behind a

LARGE GLASS ELEVATOR It stands in middle the open room The
elevator

is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story

exhibit In the dim light with his poor vision the monster
doesnt

see DAgosta the Mayor Kawakita and their entire group
SANDWICHED

INSIDE The monster exits the exhibit and quietly DAgosta
slides the

doors open Everyone all thirty-five people in evening clothes

quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell
at the

far side of the hall

INT SECURE STORAGE AREA 1012 - NIGHT

Margo Frock and Pendergast wait in the darkness Pendergast
for the
first time seems fazed

PENDERGAST
dont know how to deal with this
ts hellish Like nothing I ever
saw Im not trained to deal with a
monster a supernatural creature
like that

MARGO
ts not supernatural Mbwun is an
animal Part lizard part human a
genetic freak of some kind like the
half-goat half-sheep they found
last year in the jungles of Vietnam

PENDERGAST
But this isnt the jungle This is
New York How did it get here A
thing like that crossed two
continents It makes no sense

FROCK
(lame)
We think it may have something to do
with the eggs we found in the crate

PENDERGAST
I dont believe it

MARGO
None of that matters now The people
upstairs need us We have to help

FROCK
We cant Weve managed to get
inside the one place thats safe I
think we should sit tight and wait
for reinforcements If we go
outside were risking more lives
You have to accept it Margo
theres nothing we can do The
building must be swarming with
police by now It wont take long
for them to get through the doors

MARGO
That thing could kill ten people in
a matter of minutes

PENDERGAST
But what can we do Our guns are
useless --

MARGO
We have the fibers Dont you see
The creature is hungry It wants the
hormones in these plants It would
take hundreds of human brains to
supply whats in these fibers Were
just a poor substitute To make it
stop hunting we have to give it
what it wants

the oak
doors We see the HAIR ON HIS BACK rise
JONATHAN

CUTHBERT
Eight to the right Look I found

Clutching the rabbits foot like a talisman Cuthbert leaps up
just as
the last tumbler falls
At this the oak doors behind them CRASH OPEN splintering like so
many
match sticks
Cuthbert SCREAMS in a high pitch whine at the sight of the beast
The
dog barks wildly at Mbwun Jonathan lifts his shot gun But the
monster barrels past him and zeros in on Cuthbert
A HUGE RED TONGUE LICKS OUT and encircles Cuthberts waist It
squeezes him horribly drags him towards the open jaws Cuthbert
bellows like a lamb being led to the slaughter He opens his
hand and
the rabbits foot drops The last Jonathan sees of Cuthbert is
his

head disappearing down Mbwuns throat
Hobbes barks and whines in terror Jonathan takes the leash and
drags
the animal out

INT MUSEUM HALLWAYS - NIGHT

Jonathan and Hobbes tear down the hallway and disappear Behind
them
comes a roar so loud it rattles the walls

INT HALLWAYS - SECURE STORAGE AREA - NIGHT

The door opens slowly and Pendergast appears He shines his beam
in

both directions

PENDERGAST
All clear

Margo and Frock quickly come out Margo holds the crate Frock
tries
to follow in his wheelchair

FROCK

danger

MARGO

rooms Were going upstairs Well

FROCK

Margo this is too dangerous You

enough information The animal might
behave in unexpected ways

(to Pendergast)
Leave her here with me Dont put
her in danger

PENDERGAST

MARGO
No Youll need me --

At this a LOUD SOUND comes from upstairs

FROCK

room

1010 Inside are shelves of priceless ivory tusks Margo takes
Pendergasts handkerchief and wraps her hand She quickly
sprinkles

some of the fibers inside the door to room 1012 Before Dr
Frock
disappears into room 1010 he looks back to Margo one last time

FROCK
Come back and get me

MARGO
We will

FROCK
Remember it has poor eyesight It
hunts with its sense of smell So
for Gods sake Margo dont get
those fibers on your clothes

hallway and a false wall by the
Greek vases Run

DAGOSTA
Everybody Get behind me

The others move past DAgosta Frank and Greg Kawakita hold the
rear

The group runs to the side exit to the planetarium and ina
moment

disappears

INT HALL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MAMMALS - NIGHT

Pendergast remains at the window watching anxiously From the
south
entrance to the planetarium an ENORMOUS DARK SHAPE slinks into
view
Pendergast steps back from the doorway turns to Margo

PENDERGAST
Hide quickly

MARGO
What are you going to do

Pendergast checks his gun totally calm

PENDERGAST
Buy them some time

Margo turns and looks around at the looming dioramas Theres a
plain

door at their end of the hall Pendergast faces the broken
window

HIS POV the beast is slinking away after DAgosta and the

others
headed to the north exit from the Planetarium

PENDERGAST calls out

PENDERGAST
Hey you big tub of lard Over here

THE BEAST PAUSES turns

Pendergast puts his palms up at his ears wiggles his fingers and
makes a face through the window

PENDERGAST
Come on you smelly pile of refuse
Come get me I dare you

A LOW surprised GROWL comes from the beast It crouches as if to
pounce Pendergast makes more faces sticks his tongue out The

beast
watches in silence its evil eyes fixed

ON MARGO watching Pendergast She cant leave him yet

MARGO
What is it doing

PENDERGAST
(loud)
Its scared of me
Suddenly theres a CRASH and the door BENDS like cardboard TWO
HUGE

SETS OF CLAWS lash through Margo screams as the claws pass
inches

from Pendergasts face He leaps back lifts his gun which looks
like

a pea shooter in the face of Mbwun

Two sets of claws curve around the bent edges of the door then
Mbwun

simply LIFTS it out of the frame This leaves Pendergast face to
face

with the foul enormous monster It regards him evenly blinks
once

Then the tongue slides out licks its lips eagerly and

Pendergast FLICKS on his high powered FLASHLIGHT shining it at
close

range right in the beasts eyes Then carefully with total calm
he

FIRES ONCE TWICE The beast howls more in anger than pain
REARS UP

and swipes at Pendergast Pendergast dives to one side and the
claws

miss again by inches as the beast is temporarily blinded by the
light

Now Pendergast spins and runs for all hes worth Margos been

waiting holding the door

PENDERGAST
Drop the fibers

She leaves the crate behind as Pendergast dives inside with her

shoves the door shut hard as Mbwun still blinded leaps into the
hall But now suddenly all is quiet No sign of Margo and
Pendergast The beast moves forward snuffling slowly It

s for

the door which hides Margo and Pendergast but stops as it

THE CRATE The beast moves to it clearly surprised It pokes
at the

crate carefully inhales the fragrance and grunts The monster
seems

to be struggling with itself It sniffs the fibers lifts a few
out

carefully then SHOVES THE CRATE AWAY HARD Then it rises on its

haunches and squints into the dark

On all sides are glowing displays of stuffed buffalo gazelle
wild
horses wolves giant elk sabre tooth tigers Mbwun moves close
to

one after another Suddenly we notice in the back of one of the
dioramas

Margo and Pendergast They stand frozen crouching behind
mannequins

of native Americans riding horses across the plains The beast
sniffs

RIGHT AT THEIR WINDOW then turns away Confused it heads back

towards the Planetarium and slinks from the room

INSIDE THE DIORAMA Pendergast and Margo exchange an astonished
look
They whisper

PENDERGAST
What happened

MARGO
Its eyesight is worse than I
thought It couldnt see us And it
couldnt smell us through the glass

PENDERGAST
It didnt want the fibers What does
that mean

MARGO
I think it means its full

PENDERGAST
Then it wont go after the others

MARGO
No Its still hunting but not for
the hormones

PENDERGAST
For what
MARGO
I think for the pleasure of the

kill
INT HALLWAY - MUSEUM - NIGHT

Greg the Mayor DAgosta and the others are in a hallway lined
with

at least a dozen vases A GREEK VASE has been shoved aside
revealing
the outlines of a door Behind is a sloping dark corridor The
last of

the thirty-five people pack in Greg and DAgosta cover the
corridor

DAGOSTA
Thats it lets go

Grim-faced DAgosta follows Kawakita as they duck through the

doorway shutting it behind them The impact rattles the wall
and the

Greek vase falls

INT SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT

Kawakita and DAgosta reach the bottom and turn to see the Mayor
his

wife Dr Pound and their whole group standing in several feet of

rushing water Lauren is shivering Her father has his arm
around her

tight Behind them are two corridors one forking left and the
other

straight DAgosta gets out the walkie talkie clicks it on

DAGOSTA
(into walkie talkie)
Pendergast We made it You all

INT DIORAMA - NIGHT

Pendergast has the plans open as he studies them He speaks into
the
walkie talkie Margo paces behind him thinking hard

PENDERGAST
Were fine Take the left fork
behind you Youll be in a straight
passage When the hall forks again
in fifty yards go right Then radio
back

INT SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT
DAgosta shuts off his walkie talkie Everyones staring at him

DAGOSTA
All right Kawakita cover the rear

KAWAKITA
Oh shit
FRANK
No Lieutenant Hes not a good
enough shot Ill do it if you take
care of my daughter

DAgosta nods Frank expertly reloads DAgosta holsters the
walkie

talkie and they plunge down the left hand passage Kawakita
takes

charge of Lauren who is confused and terrified The tunnel has
a

slight downhill grade and the water begins to move faster
tugging at

everyones legs People slip and slide as they half make their

way
down the hill DAgosta calls behind them
DAGOSTA
Damn Its getting deep See
anything
ON FRANK back not far from the first fork He looks towards
the head
of the tunnel calls out
FRANK

Youll be the first to know

Frank turns and plunges after the others But then suddenly he
stops

ON DAGOSTA he reaches the second fork and takes a right
This

tunnel is narrower and consequently the water is even deeper
Slimy

plants hang down and slap at their faces as they push on
DAgosta

pulls out his walkie talkie

DAGOSTA
Pendergast I made the right hand
fork Were already in about three
feet of water Where should we go

But before Pendergast can answer DAgosta hears the loud report
of

Franks gun Everyone freezes in the darkness The walkie
talkie

cackles and DAgosta shouts

DAGOSTA
Hello
FRANK (OS)
Sweet Jesus help

They hear SPLASHING in the water Lauren SCREAMS tries to run
back

Kawakita grabs her Theres more thrashing water and then
silence

DAGOSTA
Frank Are you all right

DAgosta starts for Frank but the Mayor catches his arm and holds

him
MAYOR
Its too late
Everyone waits staring into the darkness Still no answer
Lauren

SCREAMS AGAIN

LAUREN
Dad

DAgosta turns his flashlight on the water Its running red
He spins
to the Mayor points down the tunnel

DAGOSTA
Run

People start to cry and whimper as the Mayor urges them on He
takes

charge of Lauren Only Greg Kawakita stays with DAgosta They
stand

shoulder to shoulder and completely alone Thrashing in the
water can

be heard as the beast comes closer Theres a low pleasurable
growl

Both men lift their guns

DAGOSTA
On three

Kawakita nods Behind them in the tunnel is total blackness
Ahead is

equally dark The noise of their friends gets ever fainter The
water

now rushes half way up their thighs Kawakitas teeth start to

chatter He bites them shut steadies his gun
DAGOSTA
One two

Silence as the water murmurs DAgosta holds the count A long
agonizing moment Kawakita takes his eyes away from the tunnel

KAWAKITA
I think its gone

Suddenly a HUGE CLAW snakes out of the water right in front of
them

and the beast roars up It was beneath the surface directly
before

them The claw closes on DAgosta and his shot gun goes off
DAgosta

screams as the beast lifts him towards its mouth

For one horrible moment Kawakita is frozen Then he leaps
forward

shoves the barrel of his gun behind DAgosta right in the
beasts

open jaws He pulls the trigger and the shotgun explodes the
recoil

throwing him back ass over tea cups in the water With a roar
of pain

the monster drops DAgosta and retreats in the dark DAgosta
grabs

Kawakita

DAGOSTA
I think you took its tonsils out

They haul ass down the tunnel firing behind them as they go
Ahead is

another fork The group is waiting When they see DAgosta and

Kawakita a cheer goes up

MAYOR
Which way

As he runs up DAgosta grabs for his walkie talkie The holster
Is

EMPTY the walkie talkie gone Without missing a beat he
registers

whats happened then covers it up with the next breath He
points to

the right as if theres no doubt and says

DAGOSTA
This way
DAgosta exchanges a look with Kawakita who understands exactly
what

happened As they plunge into the right tunnel Greg mutters

KAWAKITA
Holy shit

MARGO
The answers right in front of us

She points to one of the dioramas It shows a bird being stalked
by a
fox

MARGO
Thats a ptarmigan feigning a
broken wing The bird pretends to be
injured to draw the fox away from
its nest

PENDERGAST

They disappear down the hall with the Greek vases both calling
with
all theyve got

EXT MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT
There are increasing numbers of SWAT vehicles around A

out

into the room his eyes scanning the dark He whispers to
Hobbes as

Suddenly he sees something What appears to be a BODY lying on a
glass

case Jonathan pumps his gun approaches slowly The man wears
a

tuxedo is lying very still As we get closer we see its THE
DRUNK

Kawakita ran into in the stairwell so long ago He suddenly
HICCUPS

JONATHAN
Hey Wake up

JONATHAN
You wouldnt believe me if I told

Hobbes has started to wag his tail and tug at the leash to draw
Jonathans attention

JONATHAN
What is it boy

From above comes the beating of a distant HELICOPTER and then the

sound of breaking glass Hobbes pulls Jonathan back to the
staircase

Jonathan grins follows behind with the drunk

DRUNK

illuminating the dinosaurs and a SWAT team which is
descending on

INT HALL WITH GREEK VASES - NIGHT

Pendergast and Margo are at the top of the long narrow shaft

Pendergasts flashlight sends a circle of light onto a sheet of
black

oily water below Both of them continue calling trying to draw
off

the monster

MARGO
Help someone

PENDERGAST
Oh God Help

They suddenly hear the sound of splashing An updraft rustles
their

clothes Margo sniffs the air turns to Pendergast

MARGO
You smell that

PENDERGAST
Its coming Run

INT SUB-BASEMENT - NIGHT
The group has reached another intersection of tunnels The left
fork
turns back uphill DAgosta indicates this tunnel

DAGOSTA
At least well be dry

They all press forward in the low vaulted darkness As they move

steadily upwards the water recedes Kawakitas flashlight
flickers and

he bangs it It comes on again

KAWAKITA
I believe in you a hundred percent
Vince but thats the second time
weve been at that intersection

DAGOSTA
Not so loud

DAgosta shines his light forward and they see that the shaft
ends in
a large round PIPE

KAWAKITA
Whats that

DAGOSTA
All right everybody hold up

Kawakita and DAgosta move past the shivering people who are
strung

out along the sides of the tunnel DAgosta touches each person
as he

passes

DAGOSTA
We dont know whats in there Let
me go first

INT PIPE - NIGHT

The Mayor follows behind with the group as Kawakita and DAgosta
lead

the way The pipe is dry and rusted They move forward with
stealth

In twenty feet the pipe ends abruptly in darkness DAgosta

steps out
first

INT CAVERN - NIGHT
The group huddles at the mouth of the pipe confused as DAgosta
pans

his flashlight around the huge space The walls are carved out
of dirt

and rounded like a cave From the ceiling hang huge cobwebs
Theres a

large pile of sticks in one corner fashioned rather like a bed
Ona

mound of dirt beside this bed rests a battered duffel bag

Greg moves to it shines his light on the side A name is
written in
marker

DAGOSTA
What does it say

KAWAKITA
(looks up shocked)
Dr John Whittlesley

DAGOSTA
Whats that doing here

KAWAKITA
I dont know I thought Dr
Whittlesley died in South America

MAYOR
(interrupts)
Look Theres a ladder at the end I
think it goes up to the street

They move forward into the darkness eagerly towards the ladder
which

leads up to a manhole But as they pass the bed of twigs
something

loud CRUNCHES underfoot

KAWAKITA
What is that

DAgosta shines his light down and everyone freezes Then one
woman
SCREAMS

The wide dirt floor around them is carpeted in clean white BONES
The

HUMMING noise is louder and we see its source Atop the bones is
the

body of CUTHBERT Its covered with BLACK DERMESTID BEETLES
Theyre
stripping the skeleton clean devouring the flesh

The group panics and breaks for the ladder Kawakita and
DAgosta once
more guard the rear

KAWAKITA
Dear God Where are we Lieutenant

DAGOSTA
Id say were in its home

INT HALL OF THE NORTHWEST COAST INDIANS - NIGHT

Pendergast and Margo run down the long dark room passing an
enormous

hollowed-out canoe As they exit the far end the dark shape of
Mbwun

emerges It leaps forward closing in fast

INT HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

Margo and Pendergast enter a series of maze-like room with hidden

corners nooks and crannies with cases full of esoteric Buddhist
and

Japanese Art Theyre running through the twists and turns as
fast as

they can
PENDERGAST
Were not going to make the storage
room
MARGO

Listen to me Pendergast Mbwuns
DNA is part homo sapien In
primates the eye is a direct path
to the brain If you get a clean
shot theres only one place you can
kill it Shoot it in the eye

AT THIS THEY ROUND A CORNER AND MBWUN LEAPS OUT It circled
ahead and

was waiting in front of them The animal swipes at Margo and

Pendergast The force of the monsters blow sends Margo reeling
and

slams Pendergast into the wall He falls crumples and drops his
gun

The case beside him SHATTERS spewing relics as Mbwun pushes
past

Pendergast groans and gets to his knees with difficulty
MARGO is frantically crawling away in the dark The beast makes
a low

sound of pleasure and reaches out one claw easily pins her down

Pendergast looks frantically for any kind of weapon

ON MARGO now PINNED BENEATH the heaving body of the monster
Powerless she looks up into the horrible face of death as Mbwun
raises an enormous claw Pendergast desperate cries out --

PENDERGAST
Please no Dont hurt Margo

Oddly enough the beast pauses for once Talking to the damn
thing is

the one tactic no one has tried The claw halts in mid-air The
beast

blinks once and looks from Pendergast to Margo Margo sees a
flash of

something unexpectedly HUMANin its eyes In astonishment she

whispers

MARGO
My God You understand

As they stare amazed imperceptibly the beast appears to narrow

its

eyes in response Margo controls her voice keeps it even

MARGO
Please let me go We wont hurt you

A strange noise comes out of the monster A low confused growl
He

doesnt loosen his grip on Margo but he leans down to look at
her

closer with one green unblinking eye

She struggles not to turn away in revulsion His enormous jaws
are

right near her throat Everything is very still And then

A BARRAGE OF FIRE breaks out The SWAT team is in the
doorway

laying down everything theyve got The creature ROARS as if
betrayed

leaves Margo and LEAPS UP It barrels down on the SWAT team
picks

up Jennings and SPIKES HIM TO THE GROUND Jennings hits the
floor with

his neck at a crazy angle It snaps like a twig The other men
drop
back Mbwun follows tearing through the men cutting a deathly
swath

Pendergast moves to help the SWAT team Margo struggles to

her

feet and her hand touches the wall Beside her is a FIRE HOSE in
a

cabinet In a split second Margo hauls it out throws a switch
and

gets a BLAST OF WATER She turns it on the beast as it grabs for

Pendergast The force of the water is enormous It pushes the
monster

out the end of the hall
Pendergast runs towards her takes the hose and holds it

PENDERGAST
Run

She takes off blindly in the maze-like room From somewhere
behind her
she hears a horrible HOWL

ON MARGO as she twists and turns through the rows of display
cases

tearing blindly in the dark Ahead is a door She dives through
it and

finds shes in

INT MENS ROOM - MUSEUM - NIGHT

A row of mirrors and urinals line the wall Its a huge room
designed

to handle crowds of visitors Margo ducks into one of the stalls
as

MBWUN crashes in Margo looks through a crack in the door to
see

THE ANIMAL AT FULL STOP ITS STARING AT ITSELF IN THE ROW OF
MIRRORS

The sight appalls it and the beast lets out a hideous sound The
claws

lash out breaking every mirror in the place littering the floor
with

glass

Then the beast turns and backs up groaning as if cornered
Margo

sees now that one limb is dragging leaving a trail of blood
The

mouth too appears to be bleeding The SWAT teams bullets
had an
affect

Margo presses back in the stall bracing as the beast gets
closer

Its just outside It sniffs the air once and suddenly turns
rears

up furious and crashes through the bathroom door Margo screams
and

the thing grabs her It holds Margo up before it and roars It
closes

its massive claws around her as if she is somehow responsible for

everything The claws tighten She struggles and fights to no
purpose

but then the beast pauses its seen something

THE NECKLACE WITH TWO ARROWS AROUND HER NECK

It stops and its grip loosens A pained look flashes across its
bestial face

And in that split moment Margo looks down

A NECKLACE OF SILVER gleams around the beasts throat too The
necklace is the twin to her own

ON MARGO Can it be possible She stares at the thing

MARGO
Johns necklace You killed him

Incredibly the beast shakes its head A noise comes from it a
sad

noise like a groan And now Margo gets it She can hardly
believe it

Her eyes widen in astonishment She whispers

MARGO
Oh Jesus John

The name is a knife through the monsters heart

MARGO
No Its not possible

The last piece of the puzzle falls The monster is John
Whittlesley
Margo still desperately frightened tries to keep control

MARGO
John If it is you I can help
The monster shakes its head no and releases her As she watches
he
moves away quickly limps out the door

INT HALL OF THE ASIAN PEOPLES - NIGHT

Mbwun now drags himself across the grey carpet headed for the
stairs

In the darkness of the hall of Asian Peoples Pendergast is
waiting

He lifts one of the SWAT team rifles which he holds in his
hands

He aims is about to fire but then Margo comes up behind him

MARGO
No Dont kill him Pendergast you
were right Its John

PENDERGAST
What

MARGO
That thing is John Whittlesley I
should have seen it before The
fibers are infected with a virus
You eat them and the virus alters
your DNA He became addicted to them
in South America followed the
plants back to the states He
probably entered the country as a
man It would have taken several
months for the change to take place
Thats how he got from the boat to
the museum

Pendergast looks over and sees the monster His eyes show
disbelief

Mbwun looks back at both of them briefly then it disappears up
the

stairs

PENDERGAST
I dont believe it

MARGO
You have to Listen All viruses
pass on their own DNA Instruct the
cells of the host to make more
viruses This one was different It
inserted a whole array of genes into
John Reptile genes sixty five
million years old Those genes
remade him Its not his fault

PENDERGAST
Whatever that thing is we have to
kill it

Margo tries to stop him but he shrugs her off

EXT MUSEUM ROOF - NIGHT

A helicopter hovers outside pouring a circle of light down on the
roof Ippolito watches as the drunk is pulled up through the
hall ina

sling Waters approaches holding the walkie talkie

WATERS
We cant raise the SWAT team No
ones answering What do you want to
do

Ippolito eyes are fixed on the room below them

IPPOLITO
Holy shit Pull him up

Lightning throws horrible shadows of the hulking dinosaur
skeletons

all around as MBWUN LIMPS INTO THE HALL The men on the roof
stare

down astonished Their mouths hang open at the sight

IPPOLITO
Get more guns Now

The men get the drunk up and abandon the sling leaving Jonathan
trapped below

INT HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

Jonathan and Hobbes take cover behind one of the dinosaurs and
hide

Mbwun sees Jonathan lifts both claws SWINGS at the skeleton
sending

it crashing down Jonathan SCREAMS Hobbes is caught and falls
He

scrambles into a corner whimpering as Pendergast and Margo
appear in

the door Fifteen more SWAT team members with rifles now
line the

hole in the roof They all point their guns at Mbwun

IPPOLITO
Get back Were going to shoot
Now Margo runs forward

MARGO
No Wait Let me talk to him first

IPPOLITO
(screaming)
Kill that thing Kill it now

MARGO
No
MBWUN turns and sees Margo She speaks desperately
MARGO
John you can give up now Just lie

down where you are

Mbwun seems to consider for a moment but then its eyes gleam and
it

ROARS With renewed vigor it leaps to the wall and starts to
WALK UP

IT like a GECKO ON ALL FOURS ON THE ROOF

Some of the SWAT team fall back in terror Now that the
monster is
on the wall its out of range of their fire

WATERS
Holy shit its coming this way

IPPOLITO
Its headed for the roof Run

Ippolito turns and takes off once more in sheer terror
Astonished
Waters tries to regain control

WATERS
Get back here you asshole We cant
let it get out
(to the SWAT team)
Surround the opening and kill it

But the men are terrified retreating like Ippolito Waters
shouts

WATERS
Back everybody Thats an order
But the team is in chaos and losing precious time
INT HALL OF THE DINOSAURS - NIGHT

The MONSTER is now half way up the wall Margo is distraught
crying
Her cool demeanor is cracked

shakes her
head

Pendergast is with her She

MARGO
Just like John He wont listen

PENDERGAST
I have to shoot

MARGO

Do it quickly Please Aim for the
eye

Pendergast raises a HIGH POWERED RIFLE with a laser sight

He
aims the

red laser beam directly at Mbwuns left eye

PENDERGAST
He has to look here or I wont get a
clear shot Call him Margo

MARGO
I cant

PENDERGAST
You have to Do it now

Margo takes a moment her eyes streaming

She has no choice she
calls

out

MARGO
John John look at me

The beast looks down sees Pendergasts rifle

Theres a long
awful

moment Suddenly it emits a sound like a wail

ON JONATHAN staring stunned
PENDERGAST steady
MARGO

Shes crying as she raises her arm as if to say good-
bye
And the gun EXPLODES

ON MBWUN its head shoots back in pain and it falls sixty
feet

straight down to the ground Silence Thunder rolls

Its over Pendergast turns to Margo and quietly folds her in
his

arms
