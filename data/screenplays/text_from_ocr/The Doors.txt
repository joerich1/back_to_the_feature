SHOOTING DRAFT

INT BLACK SCREEN

MORRISONS VOICE
The movie will begin in five moments
The mindless voice announced
All those unseated will await the
next show
We filed slowly languidly into the
hall
The auditorium was fast and silent
As we seated and were darkened
The voice continued
The program for this evening is not
new
Youve seen this entertainment
Through and through
Youve seen your birth your life
and death
You might recall all the rest
Did you have a good world when you
died
Enough to base a movie on

FADE IN

INT RECORDING STUDIO (LAST SESSION) - LA DEC 1970 -

A dark silence hovers along the deserted bunker-like

MIKE stands and booms shadow a grand piano

The ENGINEER waits in the booth lit alert man
fiddling

ENGINEER
Hey Jim Its your birthday man
whaddaya say we try this another
night

bored
Camera moving tentatively along the shadows
discovering the
sidelight on a Navy surplus pea jacket thrown on a

chair
moving to a candles orange flutter on pages written
with
verse a hand breaking the seal of the bottle of
Irish
Bushmills whiskey
VOICE
(off)
Kill the lights a little more will
ya John
They might drop a bit more Camera crawling past the
FINGERS
weaving a new cigarette out of the Marlboro pack An
ashtray
full of butts and an asthmatic horrid cough filled
with
phlegm crawling up the slight paunch in the bright
jersey
with 66 on it stitched on the sleeve is the team
mascot --
an American Indian in full headdress
ENGINEER
(off)
Hey man how come the Doors arent
in on this
Camera revealing JAMES DOUGLAS MORRISON -- 27 poet
buried
in the shadows curls of cigarette smoke about his
haunted
sensuous eyes meditative lips scragged with beard and
long
greasy hair not a pretty sight yet a man full and
bold and
struggling for survival through his words beneath
the
Bushmill moon he takes the tambourine and shakes it
violently

in our face

JIM
No music No Doors Lets roll Is
everybody in Is Everybody in
Is everybody in The ceremony is
about to begin

He shakes a TAMBOURINE at the mike and one of his
giant Indian YELLS rock through the studio

JIM
WAKE UP HAS THIS DREAM STOPPED

Music riffs from American Prayer AUDIENCE SOUNDS
on the track The ENGINEER reeling backwards from the
shift in sound cursing silent

JIM VOICE

Let me tell you about the heartache
and the loss of God Wandering
wandering in hopeless night Indians
scattered on dawns highway bleeding
ghosts crowd the young childs fragile
eggshell mind

The GRIN on Jims face magnesium flares out to
EXT ARIZONA DESERT - DAY (1940S)
The blinding YELLOWNESS of the desert so barren so
stings to look at An OLD CHEVROLET winds through the
orange landscape beneath a brooding blue SKY crackling
ELECTRICITY -- the storm coming in in the distance as
MUSIC writhes out at us like a reptile from under a
the beat of RIDERS ON THE STORM
DOORS SONG
Riders on the storm Into this house were born
Into this world were thrown
Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan
Riders on the storm
CREDITS ROLL OVER THIS DREAMSCAPE

JIM VOICE

(continues over imagery)

--me and my mother and father and
grandmother and grandfather were
pointing at

man in

sound

wounded

down

INDIAN

driving through the desert at dawn
and a truckload of Indian workers
had either hit another car or just --
I dont know what happened Indians
were scattered all over the highway
bleeding to death

INT CAR - DAY

MOM DAD the youngest BABY in the front seat --

the storm

GRANDMA and GRANDAD in the back with JIM about 4 and his
SISTER 3 asleep

Moms a beauty and Dads an austere handsome military
civilian clothes mouthing words -- look wake them up
desert storm but we barely hear

A LIGHTNING BOLT shreds the blue sky with a thunderous
frightening dawn of creation

Grandma nudging Jim awake His eyes open --

Just as the car turns the bend -- revealing

An overturned TRUCK lying in the road -- dead and
INDIANS everywhere A cop car ambulance A terrible
accident

The first thing Jim sees
An old INDIAN FACE staring at him
The car pulling alongside Dad rolling his window
asking if he can help (SOUNDLESS) A line of wailing
WOMEN CHILDREN
Moms scared face
JIM VOICE
but it was the first time I tasted
fear I musta been about four like

a child is just like a flower his
head is floating in the breeze
him
the

amazing

gourd
the

announcing the

point

Grandma trying to hide Jims face but he looks back
THE COP WAVING THEM THROUGH
The kid looking back through the rear window terrified

his first view of death The bodies the sense of doom

overlaying the land -- a childs worst nightmare
MOM
Its just a dream Jimmy just a
dream
SONG
(continues)

Theres a killer on the road

His brain is squirming like a toad
Take a long holiday

Let your children play

If you give this man a ride

Sweet family will die

Theres a killer on the road

The boys eyes going back to the Indian MAN looking at

then to the dying opened body bleeding out its guts on

asphalt the dying mans face twisted moaning
eyes at the point of death -- they settle on Jim
MOM

Its just a dream Jimmy just a dream
A strange SOUND occurs -- the rattle of an ancient
shi-chi-chi shi-chi-chi Something flying through
air A bull-roarer a whirling leather thong

appearance of a shaman

INTO JIM -- his eyes staring out the back His receding
of view -- the Indians the overturned truck
JIM VOICE

The reaction I get now looking
back is the soul of the ghosts of
those dead Indians -- maybe one or
two of them were just running around

JIM in torn black chinos no shirt walking real slow

Baudelaire his eyes settling on

A YOUNG BEAUTY and her yellow labrador -- a fashionable
long red-haired 20th century fox in jeans moving
the crowd

He thinks about it -- a fraction of eternity -- and
off after her

EXT VENICE CANAL - DAY

She moves along its banks as if the universe moved to
rhythm turning once to look back Jim caught in her
Theyre alone Now hes the one seized by doubt He

pretends to take another interest

She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked
And her legs are long
When she moves

My brain screams out this song

EXT VENICE CANAL - ANOTHER CANAL - DAY

As she turns into another street he resumes following

her

She gets to a house goes in Theres a group of people

partying He stops watches

Sidewalk crouches at her feet

Like a dog that begs for something sweet

Do you hope to make her see you fool

Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel

EXT PAMELAS HOUSE - VENICE CANAL - THAT EVENING

The two story house has a quaint run-down charm
Friends

JIM lurks in the shadows of the trees hes been
standing

outside watching The MUSIC shifts to the quieter
LOVE

STREET

DOORS SONG

She lives on Love Street

Lingers long on Love Street

She has a house and garden

I would like to see what happens

The YOUNG MAN gestures and goes back inside the house
Shes

She has wisdom and knows what to do

She has me and she has you

The girls grinding up pot in an old shoebox with a

feet from her face balanced there effortlessly on the

like a highwire act opens her mouth in surprise

Jim drops softly to the balcony a smile of disarming
gentleness

JIM
Hi

GIRL
Wow Hi

JIM
Waste of time

His head cocked slightly onto his left shoulder he
southern gentleman polite slow thoughtful as if he

EXT VENICE CANALS - NIGHT

JIM and PAMELA moving along the byways A clear starry
California night

JIM

(SONG)

A vast radiant beach

And a cool jewelled moon

Couples naked race down by its quiet side
And we laugh like soft mad children

Theres a crash They turn bristling
A COYOTE lurks under the sickly light of a streetlamp

pulling

its head from an overstuffed garbage can looking back
at

them

EXT VENICE BOARDWALK - NIGHT

Fires on the boardwalk Hippies Bums Older People
JIM and

The two of them race down by its side slowing to a
walk

His loved orphan voice

structure overlooking the boardwalk

EXT VENICE ROOFTOP - NIGHT

PAM glancing through Jims notebooks as they sit on his
sleeping bag with a lantern and bunsen burner

moon ocean scudding clouds and a vast forest of
antennas Fires burn from the beach
In the notebooks at intervals during the conversation
see powerful sketches colored in visionary
William Blake mode with writing between Books are
panning Kerouac Ginsberg Nietzsche Rimbaud Mailer
mythological works shamanistic books a library of
ideas

PAM

(reading looking)
These are like beautiful I never
read much poetry in school I hated
it Whats a shaman
(mispronounces)

JIM
Hes the medicine man who starts in
a peyote trance And he gets everyone
in the tribe going and they share in
his vision and it heals them Its
the same in all cultures -- Greeks
Jesus Some Indians say the first
shaman invented sex Hes the one
who makes you crazy

PAM
Are you a shaman

JIM
Uh
(pause)
no I just write about it What turns
you on

PAM
I dont know Experience Freedom
Love Now Peyotes like love

When its given its blessed When
its sold its damned I like peyote
I like acid its easier to get I
like the spiritual voyage The first
time I did acid I saw God I did I
had a friend who was Christ And he
was Judas too I suddenly knew the
secret of everything -- that were
all one the universe is one And
that everything is beautiful

JIM
Is it I dont know I think youre
alive by confronting death -- by

experiencing pain

PAM
I think youre alive by recognizing
beauty -- seeing truth because when
you discover truth you discover what
love is were all saying the same
thing Its love me and Ill love
you

JIM
(looks at her ironic)
Its only thru death that you know
life Jesus medicine men heal people
by sacrificing their own life

PAM
Do you love Death

JIM
I think life hurts a lot more than
death When you die the pain is over

Pam shivers a strange thought

PAM
Why do I look at you and see my
death
(pause shrugs)
No thats ridiculous

JIM
I bet your dads a school teacher

PAM
How did you know

JIM
I dont know

PAM
What was your father

(she gets in his lap)

He runs his fingers thru her hair kissing her gently
JIM
but one the most beautiful one
of all dances in a ring of fire and
throws off the challenge with a shrug

PAM
Thats beautiful Who did you write
it for

JIM

I wrote it for you

The panties coming off Rousseau dangling from the
Venice

moon He moves a little over excited nervous more
awkward

than we might expect

PAM

hurry Im all you have to do

JIM and DOORS

We chased our pleasures here
Dug our treasures there
Can you still recall the time we
cried
BREAK on through to the other side

Some groupies have formed a small fan club at the base
of
the stage muscling past PAM but most people ignore
them
drinking arguing dancing to their own fuckbeats
Possibly
this has something to do with the fact that JIM sings
with
his back to all of them
JOHN looking over furious at RAY who mutters under the
music

RAY
Turn around Jim Come on let em in
JIM
I found an island in your arms
A country in your eyes
Arms that chained us eyes that lied

beating The beginning strains of THE END dribble in
EXT DESERT - DAY

A dented RED CHEVROLET fishtails on a dry mudflat

up dustdevils

Theyre all LAUGHING (strange noise) -- in a circle

on the edge of a precipice in deep arroyos and

rocks and cacti
A football huddle of faces - RAY JOHN ROBBIE JIM --

the
four DOORS laughing with the first mad impulse of
the
peyote
PAM is vomiting her brains out as DOROTHY tries to
comfort
her on the edge of a cliff Jim panthers up the dune
JIM
Everybody having a good time
They hug She throws up again
JIM
awright pretty good it gets
better
Jim holds his head Feels the ride
JIM
WOA Its fast
JUMP CUTS Jim and Pam are touching each other Face
Shadows
Sand falls from Pams hand Jim turns to hawk at a
bird
Hawk Hawk Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune
Abruptly Jim is back in the circle with the Doors ina
sense
torn between them and Pam EXTREME CLOSEUPS of their
faces
their eyes the tensions of the trip tearing apart
their
teeth as they go from the laughing to the dangerous
part

JIM
When the serpent appears his head
is ten feet long and five feet wide
He has one red eye and one green
eye Hes deadly and hes seven miles
long As he moves -- on his scales
is written all the history of the
world all people all actions all
of us our little pictures on the
scales God its big -- and its
eating as it moves all the time
devouring digesting consciousness
power a monster of energy

John shutters -- as does Robbie and Ray Jim seems
possessed

JIM
We must kiss the snake on the tongue
if it senses our fear it will eat
us instantly But if we kiss it
without fear the snake will take us
through the garden and out the gate
To our freedom -we must ride this
snake To the end of time

Pause He has instilled a flux of fear in the group

JOHN
I think Im fucked up Im not
thinking right

JIM
Youre fucked up John Go with it
confusion is the sound of creation

JOHN
You should see your eyes right now
youre death Look at your eyes --
youre crazy man you look crazy
You scare me

JIM
No no no John John God is crazy
too God is part insane as well as
sane Not in control all the time
Dionysus was the God of the wine He
made ecstasy but he also made madness
Madness is all right Thats what
you want isnt it isnt it Wheres

ROBBIE

I get scared thinking of all the
choices inside I could go I could
stay I can live anywhere I could
die now if I wanted Its limitless
choice and no one cares

JIM
Die Robbie

JOHN

(wandering in)
I dont know what I am Im on the
cusp of Sagittarius and Capricorn

the

gates at evening

same source the great Creator of
Being Trust him trust us Ride the

Pulling John into the circle bonding their four heads
sunk

to the desert floor Jim making wild Indian sounds
deep-

throated shoooh shoooh now humming a song from
the

desert
JIM
My wild love went riding mmmmmm
She rode all the day She ride to
the devil And ask for him to pay
shooo shoooo

falling

proclaiming the answers to the Mysteries the story of
Creation

Camera weaving up to see one of the faces of the

Theres danger on the edge of town

Ride the Kings highway

Weird scenes inside the gold mine

Ride the Kings highway west baby

The sound of a rattle -- shichishichi -- he realizes
being watched By what He whips his eyes everywhere A
LIZARD perches on a boulder assesses him calmly

a former skin clinging to its throat spits a forked
and drills its black pearly eyes into his skull Now
sound of the Bull-Roarer whipping the air announcing
appearance of the shaman

Jims struck with an overwhelming sense of awe
mysteries He turns The lizard is looking at him

The GHOST of the DEAD INDIAN is also looking at him We
looking at JIM from its point of view -- a blur of
some headdress a sense of skins music drops back
lyrics the voice is old familiar possible Spanish
dialect or huararchi

The band has come together fully now ROBBIES fingers

across the trembling strings staring at the ceiling
wandering around the darkened portions of stage left

feels Jim -- echoes him back with his flamenco-blues

JOHN on drums reading Jims moods throws in the
and violent riffs that keep it savage He literally
Jims ears with his drums

And RAY concentrated with his nodding head like a big
flamingo over his keyboard mixing it up throwing

yet also -- and more delicately -- torturing Jim with
messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears There
something of Merlin in Ray -- the alchemist knowing how

play Jim
And JIM -- that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing

animal --
ready at last to share both his body and his soul with
the
world to live out the words of the Indian prophet
to
lead
JIM
The killer awoke before dawn
He put his boots on
He took a face from the ancient
gallery
And he walked on down the hall
Ray looks over up from his board catches Robby with a
‘whats
this look They go with it improvising
Jim clutching the mike tighter seeking solace in its
arms
it all hangs in the air as if he doesnt have any idea
what
hes going to say next

He went to the room where his sister
lived
And he paid a visit to his brother
And then he went on down the hall

and shoots violently backwards hitting the floor like
puppet cut from his string -- we sense Jim himself has
a barrier now gone into yet another stage of his

a stage from which he can never return Like the

who has killed his first man

RAY sees it instantly where its going hits the organ
and John follow the instruments EXPLODE all at once
to bury Jim in his primal unmistakeable scream

Camera moving in past the buffet champagne flowers in

hotel suite overlooking CENTRAL PARK to the DOORS in
armchairs surrounded by an informal group of a DOZEN
JOURNALISTS and PRESS PHOTOGRAPHERS JIM behind dark

drinking long Hawaiian fruit punches decked out in

JOURNALIST 1
(stiff Times type)
What are your songs about Mr
Morrison

TIME DISSOLVES over the questions and answers A
dreamy quality

JIM
Uh love death travel revolt We
all write the songs were interested
in anything about disorder chaos
especially activity which seems to

have no meaning I think when you
make peace with authority you become
authority

JOURNALIST 1
Can you define that a little more

JIM
Yeah you can call us erotic
politicians I guess

DISSOLVING
JOURNALIST 2
Do you really consider yourself a
shaman Mr Morrison
DISSOLVING

JIM
»a scapegoat maybe -- I take on
the audiences fantasies obeying
their impulses When the impulses
are destructive Im destructive
Its kinda like sucking the puss out
of a rattlesnake something like
that
panning
Warhol-

mushroom

DISSOLVING TO

JOURNALIST 1
(smiling)
like a medicine man or witch
doctor

RAY

(cuts in)
Jim said to me once the history of
rock and rolls like Greek drama or
caveman stories The audience comes
to see ancient rituals in ancient
caves Their souls in jeopardy
Theyre not watching any longer
theyre participating -- and
everythings in play your life
your death

JOURNALIST 1
(glib)
Is that why they scream so much
Gentle laughter The JOURNALISTS dont get it
their looks The backbeat of CRYSTAL SHIP dreamy hazy

like interview floating over the room like a giant

cloud
JOURNALIST 3
(more down to earth)
Mr Morrison how do you feel about
being called the ultimate barbie
doll
On Jim -- a beat A sickly smile spreads

JIM
I guess when you say something like
that its a shortcut to thinking

JOURNALIST 3
Then do you think about the dreadful
reviews your new poetry book has
gotten

Holding up a copy of The Lords and New Creatures
JIM
(softly)
I guess they didnt understand

JOURNALIST 3
(having scored)
And its true you financed its
publication

Jim motions him over whispers something at SIDDONS who
goes
to fetch a pair of scissors

RAY

(angry)
Have you bothered to read the poetry
mam You keep denying that anything
good can come from LA I mean isnt
that kind of a provincial attitude
That Bob Dylans the only poet cause
hes from the East Coast but you
wont even look past Jims goddamn
looks at the words man

JIM
(embarrassed)
Hey cmon Ray hate should be allowed

JOURNALIST 1
but what really are your songs
about Mr Morrison You preach
saving the planet making a new
age but how does drinking taking
drugs this boozy sort of apocalyptic
stance at the world influence young
people in a positive way

JIM
I like that -- boozy apocalyptic --
youre a word man but how does your
newspaper influence young people to
think about Vietnam Whos sending
the soldiers over there to die The
establishment -- right Your newspaper --
right That seems to me a lot more
dangerous than the stuff we do

DISSOLVING
OVER

JOURNALIST 3
Do you believe in drugs Mr Morrison
SIDDONS comes back in hands Jim a pair of scissors

JIM
(graciously disdainful)

Did you know Nietzsche said all
good consciousness all evidence of
truth comes only from the senses
Hey you wanna arm wrestle Come on
you look pretty tough today Cmon
Ill take you all on

JOURNALIST 3
(ignoring his smile)
And alcohol Is that considered part
of the shamans wisdom

JIM
Part of the clowns wisdom -- its
kinda the American way You know we
spend more on alcohol and tobacco
than on education

DOUBLE IMAGES on the DISSOLVES

JOURNALIST 3
Are you by any chance in a trance
now Mr Morrison

JIM
Do you hurt

JOURNALIST 3
What

JIM
What hurts you the most

He cuts his hair with the scissors A commotion

JOURNALIST 3
What are you doing

DISSOLVING

Uh got tired of the barbie doll
look It hurt

Are you serious

JIM
(cutting hair blindly)
About Yknow when people are joking
I find they are dead serious and
when theyre dead serious I find
them funny

Theyre amazed The point is made however -- visibly
anger in his action is so extreme yet so contained --

cynosure of all eyes as always Eyes shooting back at
JOURNALIST 3 JOURNALIST 4 cuts in from the back of

room altering the mood

JOURNALIST 4
What do your parents think about
what you are doing

JIM
(pause)
Actually I dont really remember
being born It musta happened during
one of my blackouts

Laughter JOURNALIST 4 with dark hair and demeanor

like jewelry on her arm and avant garde clothing large
glasses is probably a rock magazine writer but seems

like Jim and his work

JOURNALIST 4
But they mustve expressed some
feeling

JIM
(pause)
Well to be honest theyre not living
anymore so I dont like to talk about
that

Flashbulbs hitting his face at that moment
JOURNALIST 4
Could you at least tell us how they
died

Jim puts the scissors down going to a low mysterious
JIM
Oh it was a horrible car crash
in the desert in the fifties
Arizona ran right into a truckload
of Indians Navajos they were
lying out on the road all bleeding
and I was with my Grandma and Grandad
we were banged up and all and I
was looking at my Dad and he was
lying there but his throat was
severed and there was air coming
out

He puts the room in a hush He has mesmerized them and
theyre
not sure whether to believe it or not

JOURNALIST 4
Im sorry

JOURNALIST 2
I have the feeling Im being put on

Jim rises staggers slightly as he makes his way to the
bar

on the way out of the room smiles right at her
ignoring

everybody else in the room

JIM

Yall believe what you want to
believe you will anyway but it
does kinda show you what excites
people

(looking directly at

her)
Fear pity horror -- all those good
things that count Its sorta I guess
like being on the edge of an orgasm
yknow that mystery just before
you come When If Should I Will
you die for me eat me this way
the end

He goes The room in silence embarrassed nervous
titters

looking at Journalist 4 who flushes deeply as we cut

You ever try drinking blood

JIM
What

PATRICIA

It works you know You drink blood
the right time of the moon they
used to dance in the forests naked

I think thats what offended the
Puritans and led to the Burnings
They were a sexual threat to their
male order like the Bacchae -- five
days a year for Dionysus they used
to wander the hills in ancient Greece
the first witches clans of wild
women fucking looting eating animals

ghostly

CROWD still cheering

JIM

I drink so I can talk to assholes
This includes me Lets just say I
was testing the bounds of reality --
thats-all -- I was curious I
kinda always preferred to be hated
Like Erich Von Stroheim in the
movies the man you loved to hate
its meant to be ironic courage
wants to laugh Yknow its
essentially a stupid situation I go
out on a stage and I howl for people
In me they see what they want to see --
some say the Lizard King whatever
that means or some black-clad leather
demon whatever that means but
really I think of myself as a
sensitive intelligent human being
but with the soul of a clown which
always forces me to blow it at the
most crucial moment

(pause)
a fake hero a joke the gods played
on me its okay I accept the
joke and smile Death old friend
death and my cock I can forgive my
injuries in the name of wisdom
luxury romance Words got me the
wound and will get me well All join
now in lament of my cock a tongue
of knowledge in the feathered night

SIDDONS
It was 50000 You werent talking
to us that week and we figgered you

JIM
You figured What the fuck is this
Ray

RAY

Its not like a big deal Jim the
songs already been commercialized
the money was great Robbie wrote

the lyrics and he didnt mind neither
did I neither did John we gotta
get to TV

JIM
What are you saying Are we the
Doors One for all and all for one
Do you know what youre saying to
those millions of kids Just kidding

JOHN
Oh come on man you think just cause
youre the lead man in the band you
can run the whole show

JIM
(building intensity)
You think I was kidding Ray
(turning to John)
Hey John those are interesting shoes
you like those shoes

PAMELA looking drawn and pathetic finds this moment to
walk
into the studio

JOHN
(aggressive)
Yeah I do
JIM

Good Then do you want 50 of those
shoes
JOHN
No

JIM
Then what do you need more money
for

Pause Turning to Ray

JIM

Im dying Ray I wasnt kidding
Maybe you were But Ill tell you
something its not about these
desires you have man or money or
these records its about breaking
through wasnt it You just lost
something man

(to all)
We all lost something boys We lost
something

RAY
I dont think so Jim Theres a bigger
picture here

JIM
There sure is In your fucking face

A small smile flickers Jims face as he picks up the

small
TV and like a quarterback hurls it spinning end over
end
from his corner of the Control Room towards Ray and
Rothchild
and the Doors They dive for the floor as it smashes to
bits
into the wall behind the tape machines
JIM
(quietly)
Just kidding
(turning to Pam)
Hi Pam Just watchin some TV
He seems pleased to distract his anger into her She
doesnt
seem to notice anything unusual going on The Doors
silent

feeling Jims rage

PAM
(pathetic)
I wanted you to find us Jim It meant
nothing

JIM
I know I know

PAM
You dont have to torture me Jim
Let me make it up to you please

The others all look away embarrassed This is certainly
a

moment the ordinary partner might turn away from
Pamela her

tears running but her pathacy her inability to deal
with

pain is precisely what moves Jim the most -- a side of
himself

in her -- an ultimate weakness she has he shares As
he

goes to her puts his arms gently around her

JIM
Its alright honey its gonna be
alright Youre my girl and thats
the way its always gonna stay

PAM
(snuggles him zoned)
Really

JIM
(ironic to the others)
So lets keep that money machine
rolling Come on guys

Rothchild looking to Botnick and to Ray But the real
look

the unforgiving one is from Jim to Ray who feels it

Rothchild douses the lights in the studio

PAUL
Right on Jimbo

JIM

(reciting)
When I was back there in seminary
school
There was a person there
Who put forth the proposition
That you can petition the Lord with
prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
Petition the Lord with prayer
PETITION THE LORD WITH PRAYER

ROTHCHILD looking from his booth across at Jim His POV
only JIM is visible

PAUL
Where the hell did she go

In the control booth RAY and ROBBIE share a look The
have been dimmed in Jims booth and hes weaving back
forth a bottle of Ripple in his hand as they kick in
the music Camera closing now on Jim in the tender

on the money

JIM and DOORS
Can you give me sanctuary
I must find a place to hide
A place for me to hide

In the darkened booth PAM is on her knees his pants
down around his ankles caressing him sucking him off

PAM
(sotto voice)
Sing to me Jim sing to me

JIM and DOORS
Can you find me soft asylum
I cant make it any more
The man is at the door

The DOORS sense it ROTHCHILD knows it hushed Magics
suddenly in the air once more as we jump stanzas to

JIM and DOORS
Catacombs nursury bones
Winter women
Streets and shoes avenues
Leather riders selling shoes

(The monk bought lunch)
Successful hills are here to stay
Everything must be this way

Gentle street where people play
Welcome to the soft parade
But Jims voice has now gone off key floating
carefree
drifting -- drifting away
ROTHCHILD chuckles philosophically
The Doors in control booth start leaving Robbie goes
back
out to get his personal items
But the OVERDUB still plays over the booth as Jim
doesnt
realize We take liberties cutting around on the song
JIM and DOORS
All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave
(then)
The soft parade has now begun
Listen to the engines hum
People out to have some fun
A cobra on my left
Leopard on my right
The Doors and ROTHCHILD all exiting leaving BOTNICK
the
engineer to clean up some technical things and of
course
the two occupants of the darkened booth
JIM SONG
(fiercely)
Calling on the dogs When all else fails
You can whip the horses eyes
And make them sleep
And cry
The music stops Silence
Inside the booth two shadows breathe deep huddled on
the

floor in each others arms A whisper out of the dark
PAM
I love you

INT RECORDING STUDIO - LAST SESSION - NIGHT
JIM his head cocked lost in the memory

JIM

(reciting)
Why does my mind circle around you
Why do planets wonder what it would
be like to be you
All your soft wild promises were
words birds
Endlessly in flight
Being drunk is the best disguise
As the body is ravaged
The spirit grows stronger

Pause He coughs horribly the phlegm sucking out his

chest

with a horrid asthmatic sound which he douses with
another

cigarette and another shot of whiskey The Bushmills
now two

thirds empty He looks over at the MYSTERY WOMAN now
beside

him at the microphone MIKE and the SECRETARY watch

The bored ENGINEER across the darkened midnight room
yawns

(pause)

SLOW DISSOLVE

JIM
Oh great Creator of Being
Grant us one more hour to perform
our art and perfect our lives
The moths and atheists are doubly
divine in dying
We live we die and death not ends
it
Journey we more into the nightmare
Were reaching for death on the end
of a candle
Were trying for something thats
already found us

INT MIAMI AUDITORIUM - NIGHT Crammed into every available space of an old SEAPLANE

A hot night in Miami January 69 --
every space in the auditorium is
consumed unfortunately the Doors

only confirms the plasticity of their
approach Songs like Touch Me and
Follow Me Down are not the Doors

(a poem)
There was preserved in her the fresh
miracle of surprise clothed in
sunlight restless in wanting dying
of fever married to doubt how it has
changed you how slowly estranged you
solely arranged you beg for your
mercy -- OR -- but all will pass
lie down in green grass and smile
and muse and gaze upon her smooth
resemblance to the mating-Queen who
it seems is in love with the horseman
Tomorrow we enter the tomb of my
birth I want to be ready

is much more ravaged looking than before

INT BATHROOM - DAWN

She finds him now His face floating upwards angelic
the beard is now gone a little smile on his face He
be playing another joke Although she really knows as
says the words

PAM

Jim It was you I always know when
its you

(moving closer)
Come on baby get out of the tub
mamall dry you off

(pause)
Jim Morrison now you stop joking
you hear me cut it out

His face At peace as she sobs the MUSIC cresting to
lyrics

PAM
was it all right Jim did you
enjoy it when it came my baby Just
like you said itd be

JIM
(OVER)
They are waiting to take us into the
severed garden do you know how pale
and wanton thrillful comes death at
a strange hour Unannounced unplanned
for like a scaring overfriendly guest
youve brought to bed Death makes
angels of us all And gives us wings
where we had shoulders smooth as
ravens claws

DISSOLVE TO
EXT PERE LACHAISE CEMETERY - PARIS - DAY

His face etching into a perfect Alexandrine bust of
physical

beauty The camera moving to reveal a wintry day
leaves

blowing the wild cats everywhere in the empty
cemetery the

crumbling tombs the flowers fresh and dead around

Jims
tomb the graffiti wine bottles Wilde Bizet Piaf
Chopin
Morrison
JIM
(OVER)
No more money no more fancy dress
this other kingdom seems by far the
best until its other jaw reveals
incest and loose obedience to a
vegetable law I will not go I prefer
a feast of friends to the giant
family
The MUSIC rolling up on
INT CORRIDOR and STAGE - LIMBO
Smoke Some lights The distant cheers of a CROWD In
slightly
SLOW MOTION a FIGURE moves down a corridor into a
blinding
light of stage and smoke THREE OTHER SHADOWS are there
waiting -- as the GHOST moves to the microphone in
altered
motion
The AUDIENCE is out there somewhere in the dark -- we
sense
they too have become ghosts as all of us will one day
The

MUSIC continuing up to roll from AMERICAN PRAYER -- THE
END --
snatches we annotate

GHOST ANNOUNCER
Ladies and Gentlemen from Los Angeles
California -- The Doors
(ghostly applause)

JIM and THE DOORS

(snatches)
have you seen the warm progress
under the stars
Have you forgotten the keys to the
kingdom
Have you been born yet and are you
alive
Where is the feast we were promised
Lets reinvent the gods the myths
of the ages
We need great golden copulations

Camera closing past the DOORS to JIM alone circling

the

mike with his dance -- the INDIAN GHOSTMAN jigging
shaman-

like off to the side -- now levitating above the
stage all

crazy gawky dancing

JIM
Well Ill tell you a story of
whiskey mystics and men
And about the believers and how the
whole thing began
First there were women and children
obeying the moon
Then daylight brought wisdom and
sickness too soon the moon is a
dry blood beast
We have assembled inside this ancient
and insane theatre to propagate our
lust for life and flee the swarming
wisdom of the streets we live we die
and death not ends it

(screams in agony)

FATHER HAVE MERCY

Ending with a solitary sing-song croak

JIM
Bird of prey bird of prey
Flying high flying high in the summer
sky
ASHES

roll As

BLUES

THE SUBTITLE READS

FAILURE

Bird of prey bird of prey flying
high flying high gently pass by
Bird of prey bird of prey flying
high flying high
Take me on your flight

(pause then)
I will come again down from the wild
mountains
