way where the bartender spots him and holds up the paper

INTEXT NYC TAXI CAB NIGHT

THERESE sits against the window in the back of a taxi
crowded with JACK and OTHER 20-somethings MALE AND FEMALE
all involved in animated conversation we can’t hear The taxi
stops for a light and THERESE catches sight of an ELEGANT
COUPLE arm-in-arm at the corner crossing the avenue as the
light changes A strong gust of wind gives the woman some
difficulty as she tries to knot a green silk scarf around her
head
As they reach the sidewalk she turns back to face the
avenue and then recedes swallowed by swirling lights and
reflections

a department store display CAROL AIRD seen from a distance
in winter coat stands watching She wears a green silk scarf
over her head loosely tied

She turns smiles

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT EAST 50’S DECEMBER 1952 MORNING

An alarm blares over the sleeping face of THERESE BELIVET
huddled under covers THERESE doesn’t stir though the alarm
continues Finally THERESE in one skilled manoeuver pushes
herself up and out of bed still cocooned within the
blankets She finds the alarm clock and shuts it off She
looks at the alarm clock It reads 700 AM

THERESE moves through her morning rituals she throws open
her window shades moves on to a small gas stove strikes a
match and lights the stove to take the chill off moves on to
the kitchen sink set in one corner of the room which doubles
as a partial home darkroom - developer and fixer trays
stacked to the side of the sink an Argus C3 camera from the
late 1930s set on a shelf above the sink along with a
collection of red or amber light bulbs and photo paper

The room is sparsely furnished and much of the wall space is
taken up with THERESE’S BandW photos mostly NY CITY STREET
SCENES and URBAN LANDSCAPES THERESE is brushing her teeth
when the doorbell rings Once Twice Three times She sheds
her blankets and goes to the window opens it leans out

EXT THERESE’S APARTMENT BUILDING CONTINUOUS
THERESE’S boyfriend RICHARD SEMCO looks up at her from the
street striding his bicycle He’s well-bundled in scarf and

hat

THERESE
I like your scribbles

RICHARD looks around to the street behind him covered in
children’s chalk scribblings
RICHARD
Yeah - I’ve been busy (grinning at
her) I don’t know how you look a
million bucks first thing in the
morning

THERESE
I won’t be a minute

EXT CENTRAL PARK NY CITY MORNING

RICHARD rides THERESE to work through the park She sits with
her arms wrapped around his hips while he stands pumping away
at the pedals

RICHARD
So I got the schedules In the
mail You listening to me

THERESE
I’m listening You got the
schedules

RICHARD
And there are two sailings to
France in June one in July

THERESE

up

RICHARD accelerates THERESE laughs holds on tighter
RICHARD begins to sing “I love Paris in the summer-time
as they speed away

EXT FRANKENBERG’S DEPARTMENT STORE MORNING

Outside the employee’s entrance RICHARD and THERESE stand in
a longish line of MOSTLY YOUNG STAFF waiting to begin their
work day Everyone looks exactly the same a lot cold a
little Soviet-factory-worker glum
RICHARD
Anyway she wants to make it for you
so there’s no use fighting it once
she gets an idea in her head
She’s just going crazy with no
girls in the family but Esther-

A SECURITY GUARD has opened the door and the line has begun
to move

Upon entering each employee is handed a Santa Cap which
they dutifully put on RICHARD reaches the door takes his
cap wordlessly puts it on moves inside He holds out a cap
to THERESE

SECURITY GUARD
Compliments of the season from the
management

THERESE takes her cap doesn’t put it on moves inside

RICHARD
I gotta open the floor

INT FRANKENBERG’S EMPLOYEE CAFETERIA MORNING

From a table in the corner THERESE sips at a cup of coffee
and watches a sea of Santa-capped and uniform-smocked STAFF
move wordlessly along the breakfast line accepting gooey
eggs and cups of coffee THERESE looks down at a
Frankenberg’s employee handbook We glimpse bits and pieces
of information 2 weeks vacation after 5 years 4 weeks
vacation after 15 years full pension benefits” She
turns a page “Are YOU Frankenberg Material”

It’s too depressing to take in THERESE slips the handbook
back into her purse and removes a copy of Joyce’s “Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man” But just as she settles in
ROBERTA WALLS an officious supervisor in bright red
harlequin glasses swoops by THERESE planting a Santa cap
firmly onto her head

ROBERTA WALLS
You’re needed upstairs Miss
Belivet Make it snappy

INT FRANKENBERG’S DOLL STOCK ROOM MORNING

THERESE surrounded by rows of identical Christmas dolls
counts stock THERESE watches a very middle-aged wheezing
employee RUBY ROBICHEK struggle with carrying seven or
eight large boxes across the stock room floor RUBY can’t see
in front of her and as she attempts to peer around the edge
of the boxes most of the boxes tumble out of RUBY’S arms and
onto the floor
THERESE quickly determines she’s the only help on the floor
and goes to assist RUBY who has great difficulty in kneeling
to pick up the boxes

THERESE
(kneels to help RUBY)
Please- let me help

RUBY is grateful to avoid kneeling and places each box
THERESE hands to her on the display counter

RUBY ROBICHEK
Thanks an awful lot honey I keep
telling them upstairs we need more
stock boys come the holidays but
they haven’t listened in 18 years

THERESE
Youve been here 18 years

RUBY ROBICHEK
Oh sure And when you’re here long
enough you’ll get inventive with
juggling boxes like me

THERESE
I’m just a temporary For the
holiday

RUBY ROBICHEK
(shrugs)
I said that once

INT FRANKENBERGS TOY DEPARTMENT MORNING

Just before opening a surreal calm and silence THERESE in
Santa cap and makeshift bandage stands beside an elaborate
model train set She flips a switch and the train set comes
to life - the tiny lights the tinny whir of the engine as
the train chugs its way along the track A LOUD BUZZER
sounds Behind THERESE we can see the analogue lift
indicator start to move 5th floor 4th floor 3rd floor
as the lift descends to accept its first load of daily
customers and a voice bellows from the intercom

STORE ANNOUNCER (VO)
Good morning Happy Holidays and
welcome shoppers to
Frankenberg’s Be sure to take
advantage of our Congratulations
Ike and Mamie Inaugural Early Bird
special in our Beds and Bedding
Department on the second floor

(MORE )
STORE ANNOUNCER (V0) (CONTD)
And on your way there you won’t
want to miss our brand new General
Electric television and
stereophonic display on the first
floor just past the haberdashery

Behind THERESE the lift doors open and all at once THERESE
is swallowed up by the rush of MANAGERS STAFF and CUSTOMERS

INT FRANKENBERG’S DOLL DEPARTMENT LATER

THERESE sits behind a display case full of dolls She tries
to make herself invisible while she surreptitiously reads her
book The department is full of MOTHERS buying Christmas
gifts for their children THERESE’S reading is interrupted by
a SHARP WAILING She looks up to see a TODDLER throwing a
tantrum and an EMBARRASSED MOM trying to get the situation
under control Just then ROBERTA WALLS bustles through the
department sees THERESE points to THERESE’S head - where’s
the Santa cap ROBERTA WALLS seems to say without saying it
THERESE hurriedly stashes her book into her handbag and pulls
out the cap She tries to hide the bloodstains ROBERTA WALLS
nods to THERESE and moves on

THERESE settles back down bored A CUSTOMER looks
expectantly to THERESE THERESE pretends she doesn’t see the
CUSTOMER and ducks down to her handbag to retrieve her book
She looks up above the desk to see where the CUSTOMER went
and instead spies a glance of another woman - a woman whose
green silk scarf tied loosely around her neck and head
catches THERESE’S attention This WOMAN appears to be the
only customer surrounded by no one else This is CAROL AIRD
CAROL bends down to examine the train set and inadvertently
toggles the onoff switch - the train shuts down CAROL
stands up turns around towards the doll department smiling
as if asking for help

THERESE meets CAROL’S eyes for a strange split second - until
the EMBARRASSED MOM and the screaming TODDLER appear in front
of THERESE blocking her view of anything else

EMBARRASSED MOM
Where’s the ladies room honey

THERESE
To the left past men’s shoes then
right at the tie racks

EMBARRASSED MOM nods her thanks and hoists TODDLER away
THERESE looks for CAROL but she’s no longer there The train
set is back on and being admired by several sets of FATHERS
and SONS
INT FRANKENBERG’S DOLL DEPARTMENT MOMENTS LATER

Behind and below the desk THERESE contemplates sneaking a
read of her book but decides against it She glances back up
and sees a pair of black leather gloves tossed onto the desk
THERESE looks and sees CAROL standing before her

CAROL
I’m looking for a doll She’s about-
(she gestures)- this high and this
wide and (rethinking) Let’s
begin again shall we

As CAROL steps away from the desk a moment to rummage through
her purse THERESE can’t stop staring - at her well-tailored
suit her blonde hair her green silk scarf CAROL produces a
crumpled slip of paper steps back up to the desk gives
THERESE a big smile as she hands it to her

CAROL (CONTD)
I wonder if you might help me find
this doll for my daughter

THERESE reads the slip of paper

THERESE
Bright Betsy She cries
CAROL
Oh she does
THERESE
And wets herself But we’re out of
stock
CAROL

I’ve left it too long
She begins to rummage through her purse

THERESE
We have plenty of other dolls All
kinds umm

THERESE suddenly tongue-tied turns toward the doll display
which CAROL turns to as well

CAROL
Right What was your favorite doll
when you were four Do you
remember

THERESE
Me I never Not many to be
honest

CAROL raises a cigarette to her lips begins to light it
THERESE interrupts

THERESE (CONT’D)
Sorry No smoking on the sales
floor

CAROL
Oh of all the - forgive me (beat)
Shopping makes me nervous

THERESE
That’s okay Working here makes me
nervous

CAROL laughs appreciating THERESE’S commiseration

CAROL
Youre very kind

Their eyes meet for a moment before CAROL rummages inside
her purse again She produces a billfold opens it shows it
to THERESE It’s a photo of RINDY CAROLS 4-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER

THERESE
She looks like you Around the
mouth The eyes

CAROL
(glancing at THERESE)
You think so

THERESE looks up clocks CAROL watching her looks down A
bit of an awkward moment that CAROL rescues

CAROL (CONT’D)
So what did you want When you were
that age

THERESE
(no hesitation)
A train set

CAROL
Really That’s a surprise (beat)
Do you know much about train sets

THERESE
I do actually And there’s a new
model just in last week Hand-
built with hand-painted cars - it’s
a limited edition of five thousand
with the most sophisticated
electric switching system - it’s
quite

THERESE checks her own enthusiasm noticing CAROL’S eyes on
her

THERESE (CONT ’D)
You may have seen it Over by the
elevators Just there-

THERESE points towards the train set and CAROL turns to look
mulling it over THERESE watches her every move

CAROL
(turns back to THERESE)
Do you ship

THERESE
Special delivery Or courier
(beat) Youll have it in two three
days Two days We’1ll even assemble
it

CAROL
Well That’s that Sold

They stand there nodding at each other for a moment

CAROL (CONT’D)
Shall I pay now

THERESE
Oh - yes of course

THERESE begins writing out a sales slip then slides it over
to CAROL with a pen glancing up at her CAROL snaps out of a
brief moment of thought a distance

THERESE (CONT’D)
We’1ll need your account details
your shipping address

CAROL
Of course (she begins writing) I
love Christmas At least I love the
preparation Wrapping gifts all
that And then you somehow wind
up overcooking the turkey anyway

She finishes flashing a bright smile THERESE doesn’t quite
follow her but she doesn’t want CAROL to stop talking

CAROL (CONT’D)
Done

CAROL hands the pen and sales slip back to THERESE
CAROL (CONT’D)

Where’d you learn so much about
train sets anyway

THERESE
I - read Too much probably

CAROL
It’s refreshing Thank you (beat)
And Merry Christmas

THERESE
Merry Christmas

CAROL walks away THERESE watches her takes her all in - her
manner her style her walk CAROL turns back for a moment
and points to THERESE’S cap

CAROL
I like your hat

THERESE watches her go off past the train set and elevators
For a moment she watches as the empty spaces left behind are
filled by shoppers and staff She cranes her neck for one
last look but it’s no good She’s gone THERESE sighs She
looks down at the doll desk and sees that CAROL has left her
gloves behind

CUT BACK TO

INTEXT TAXI NEW YORK CITY NIGHT (APRIL 1953)

THERESE stares out the window still wrapped up in thoughts
Up front JACK is pointing out the West Village apartment

halt Everyone tumbles out as JACK pays the driver Before
she knows it THERESE is climbing the stairs to PHIL
McELROY’S building A window is thrown open above them and
PHIL McELROY with typically unkempt hair leans out

PHIL

INT CINEMA PROJECTION ROOM NIGHT

THERESE RICHARD PHIL and DANNIE McELROY sit crowded
together in the small dark space watching a movie through
the modest glass panel smoking cigarettes THERESE sits on
RICHARD’S lap but RICHARD is more content kissing the back
of her neck than watching the film PHIL McELROY the film
projectionist and host sits near the gears while his
brother DANNIE sits as close as he can to the movie
jotting down occasional notes in a small notebook The film
is Sunset Boulevard and the scene is Norma Desmond’s New
Year’s Eve party for two when she dances with Joe Gillis on
the marble ballroom floor THERESE is fascinated by DANNIE
but PHIL slaps him on the back of his head

PHIL
Move over Nobody else can see the
screen

RICHARD
(through his nuzzling of
THERESE)
Nobody else is watching

THERESE

THERESE

INT MIDTOWN RESTAURANT DAY

THERESE stands at the front of a small midtown restaurant
with white tablecloths and wooden rafters She glances up at
the clock which reads 112 and checks it against her
wristwatch She glances out the window There through
beveled glass she spots CAROL hurrying across the street

INT MIDTOWN RESTAURANT DAY MOMENTS LATER

CAROL and THERESE are seated at a quiet table CAROL is
removing her hat glancing at her menu as a WAITER hovers
THERESE sits transfixed her eyes quick and alert taking in
everything about CAROL from the way a delicate gold bracelet
falls against her wrist as she peruses her menu to the way
CAROL’S fingers grip her water glass

CAROL

The WAITER nods starting off as CAROL clocks THERESE’S
uncertainty THERESE not wanting to stare at CAROL now picks
up her menu and thumbs through it

CAROL
Cigarette

CAROL offers THERESE a cigarette from her exquisite silver
case THERESE notices that CAROL’S hands are lovely and
smooth salon manicured in contrast to THERESE’S own
THERESE takes a cigarette from the case CAROL lights
THERESE’S cigarette and THERESE proceeds to smoke it though
not without some effort

CAROL nods almost looks past THERESE - what is she thinking
about Suddenly it seems to THERESE that CAROL’S mood has
somehow darkened

The WAITER appears with their food He sets their plates
down CAROL picks up her silverware the cloud seemingly
past

CAROL
I’m starved Bon appetit

CAROL eats and THERESE watches almost having to force
herself to pick up her fork and knife and join her But she
does CAROL looks up at her for a moment

tries to attend to her lunch and martini

INT NEW YORK TIMES PHOTO DEPT OFFICE NIGHT

DANNIE ushers THERESE into the alluring world of a junior
photo editor’s office the contact sheets dangling from light
boards the professional equipment trays and lenses - but
mostly it’s the photos themselves that she’s in awe of
Candids crime scenes sports photos everything that makes
up the visual narrative of a newspaper DANNIE sits at a desk
and sets up dinner a makeshift array brought from home -
wrapped sandwiches bottles of beer THERESE breathes it all
in not daring to touch anything

DANNIE
Don’t worry nothing’s gonna break
if you pick it up You want a
sandwich

THERESE shakes her head picks up a contact sheet and a
magnifier and glances at the pictures DANNIE watches her

DANNIE (CONT ’D)

THERESE
They’re - probably not very good I
don’t know
DANNIE
I mean what are they What are

A pause THERESE looks through a camera lens at DANNIE He

looks up at her she lowers the lens

an intrusion or a-

DANNIE
Invasion of privacy

THERESE
Yes

DANNIE opens a beer holds it out to THERESE She takes it

DANNIE
Yeah but all of us we have you
know - affinities for people
right

THERESE doesn’t answer

DANNIE (CONT ’D)
Or certain people There are
certain people you like

THERESE
Sometimes

DANNIE
And others you don’t And you don’t
really know why you’re attracted to
some people and not others the
only thing you know is - you either
are attracted or you’re not It’s
like physics - bouncing off each
other like pin balls

THERESE
(smiles)
So now you’re a scientist

DANNIE
Just trying to explain why I write
about people rather than trees

THERESE
Sounds more like psychology

DANNIE
Physics is more comforting

THERESE grabs a sandwich

THERESE
Yeah but Not everything’s as
simple as a bunch of pin balls
reacting or

DANNIE
Some things don’t even react But
everything’s alive

A beat DANNIE moves to THERESE takes the beer bottle away

FLORENCE

INT CAROL’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM LATER

RICHARD (CONT’D)

But THERESE has already rolled up the window the car has
started to go RICHARD diminishes through the rear window
INT CAROL’S CAR APPROACHING LINCOLN TUNNEL DAY

CAROL and THERESE make their way cross town as a cool winter

sun combs through the car windows CAROL appears at home
behind the wheel - relaxed confident

To THERESE the world inside CAROL’S car is a revelation
from the tan leather upholstery and mahogany dashboard to the
effortless style and elegance of its driver The sounds of
the world - even CAROL’S occasional chatter - have been
replaced with the stillest MUSIC the sound of air and light
The presence of this older sophisticated woman who wears
silk stockings and expensive perfume is intoxicating and
unnerving in equal measure Even Carol’s purse which rests
beside THERESE on the seat is quite unlike anything she has
seen or examined so closely full of mystery and make-up and
fragrances From there her eyes wander down to CAROL’S legs
clad in smoky silk stockings Glancing down at her own legs
wrapped in sensible wool tights THERESE wonders if she will
ever be the kind of woman who owns such a car and wears such
clothes

The MUSIC broods slightly as THERESE looks straight ahead and
the car enters the Lincoln Tunnel The car plunges into the
semi-darkness as if entering a cocoon a delirious descent
which binds them together She watches CAROL’S fingers grip
the wheel how CAROL squints slightly when she concentrates

THERESE can barely suppress a tiny smile But glancing back
CAROL suddenly appears to be miles away CAROL switches on
the car radio and Jo Stafford’s “You Belong to Me” comes on

THERESE leans back in her seat as they continue speeding
through the dark tunnel

AS WE RETURN TO

INT PHIL’S APARTMENT NIGHT (APRIL 1953)

“You Belong To Me” also plays as several COUPLES DANCE among
them RICHARD and a PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN who he clutches
tightly THERESE drinking a beer watches them from a
hallway just outside the living room

RICHARD catches sight of THERESE tensing slightly before
spinning his partner up and away from THERESE’S view THERESE
looks down pulling out a cigarette from her purse and
lighting it She spots an attractive dark-haired woman on the
opposite side of the living room whose eyes are clearly on
her THERESE holds her gaze for a few seconds but she can
feel herself blush and she looks down When she looks back
up the WOMAN has disappeared THERESE saunters a bit
glancing into the next room where she spots DANNIE and his
girlfriend LOUISE slow-dancing They barely move holding on
to each other the way people do when they’re newly in love

CUT BACK TO

FLASHBACK DECEMBER 1952

INTEXT CAROL’S CAR XMAS TREE LOT NEW JERSEY DAY

At a Christmas tree lot THERESE sits in the car loading her
camera with film When she’s done she spots CAROL outside as

shots

INT CAROL’S CAR RIDGEWOOD NEW JERSEY DAY

The car makes its way to Carol’s house with the Douglas Fir
laid across the front and back seats between THERESE and

THERESE watches as mother and daughter proceed inside
chattering away

INT CAROL’S HOUSE KITCHEN DAY LATER

THERESE prepares a tray of tea and cookies Through the open

decorating the tree Almost finished CAROL is setting up a
ladder beside the tree

CAROL
Where’s the star

RINDY roots around in the pile of ornaments finds it

RINDY

CAROL

THERESE watches as CAROL ascends the ladder and places the
star at the top of the tree

into her lap

CAROL (CONTD)
Have you ever seen a more beautiful
tree And now what comes after

tree struggles to wrap the train set THERESE sits at the
piano improvising jumping from one bit of a tune to
another A half-empty bottle of white wine and a couple of
glasses stand nearby

CAROL
Were those pictures of me you were

THERESE begins to play “Easy Living” CAROL listens for a
moment rises walks over to Therese

CAROL (CONTD)
That’s beautiful

She grazes her hand on Therese’s shoulder THERESE freezes
and CAROL tries to lighten the moment with two quick strokes
to her cheek THERESE continues to play and CAROL listens

CAROL (CONT’D)
Is that what you want to be A
photographer

THERESE
I think so If I have any talent
for it

CAROL
Isn’t that something other people
let you know you have All you can
do is - keep working Use what
feels right Throw away the rest

THERESE finishes the song CAROL starts over to a table by
the couch opens a cigarette box takes one out lights it

CAROL (CONTD)

don’t even have a decent camera
But they’re all at my place
Under the sink mostly

CAROL
Invite me round

From outside the sound of a car pulling into the driveway
Car door opens and slams The moment broken CAROL rises
quickly and marches toward the front door

CAROL comes out of the living room and finds HARGE in the
entry restringing the mistletoe

CAROL (CONT’D)
Harge What’s wrong

HARGE
Nothing Does there have to be a
problem for me to visit my wife

HARGE approaches CAROL reaching out to greet her but stops
spotting THERESE at the piano in the living room He looks to
CAROL and CAROL looks away Then HARGE moves past CAROL down
the hall and into the kitchen THERESE clocks it all

INT CAROL’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM LATER

THERESE browses through a book alone in the living room as
she hears CAROL and HARGE conversing in the kitchen Through
the cracked door she catches glimpses of CAROL pacing to and
fro anxiously smoking and hears the sounds of HARGE
repairing a pipe under the kitchen sink She tries occupying
herself perusing titles of books from the bookshelf

CAROL
that’s not fair Harge We
agreed that Rindy would stay with
me until Christmas Eve

HARGE
What do you suggest I do - You
think I prefer traipsing off to

up CAROL exasperated approaches the living room doorway

THERESE

RINDY pulls back from the hug She has an idea
RINDY

There’s room for you in the car
Mommy You can come with us

CAROL
Oh darling I - wish I could
but sometimes Mommies and

Daddies decide there isn’t enough
room for them both in the same
place at the same time- (unable to
go further) And Mommy has to be
here to make sure Santa’s elf
doesn’t give your presents to
another little girl You wouldn’t
want that would you

if you won’t come-

CAROL
(she interrupts him)
Then what Then it’s over

HARGE is about to respond but he suddenly realizes he’s on
his hands and knees drunk before CAROL who is very still
and very silent

HARGE
Goddamn you - You were never
cruel

CAROL
Harge

CAROL takes a step towards HARGE She cannot bear to see him
in this state But HARGE won’t accept her help now He rises
and takes a quick look at his waiting car RINDY in the back
seat HARGE takes a few deep breaths smooths his clothes
wipes his face with the palm of his hand CAROL takes another
step towards him

CAROL (CONT’D)
I’m sorry

HARGE stiffens recoils digs his hands deep into his coat
pocket and turns away striding briskly to his car CAROL

watches as he piles in and shuts the door The car drives

off CAROL hugs herself tight against the cold

INT CAROL’S HOUSE EVENING CONTINUOUS

THERESE hears the front door quietly shut standing at the
phonograph - still silent She looks up and CAROL is there
watching her but it’s almost as if CAROL is looking through
her Then CAROL goes to switch off the phonograph and moves
off to pour herself a drink She opens the cigarette case

THERESE
I should call a cab

CAROL
And just when you think it can’t
get any worse you run out of
cigarettes

THERESE
Oh - I - tell me where to go I’11
buy some for you Really I don’t
mind-

CAROL
(snaps)
You don’t have to run out in the
middle of nowhere to buy
cigarettes Not for me I’m fine

A pause CAROL drinks THERESE covers her upset

CAROL (CONTD)
The next train’s at 650 I’1l
drive you to the station

INT CAROL’S CAR NIGHT

CAROL drives THERESE to the station There’s no one else on
the road it’s utterly noiseless At this moment there
couldn’t be more distance between them

INT TRAIN CAR NIGHT

THERESE sits against a window as the train speeds its way
back to Manhattan A couple of HOLIDAY REVELERS laughing and
tipsy bump against THERESE’S seat as they make their way
through the car THERESE turns to watch them as they make
their way to the end of the car Their joyfulness is
unbearable to THERESE She makes herself as small as she can
against the window She is crying

INT SEMCO APARTMENT NIGHT

It’s a warm ramshackle apartment full of overstuffed
mismatched furniture and bowling trophies In the kitchen
RICHARD washes up a pile of dinner plates while MRS SEMCO
sits at the table with THERESE She takes a thermometer out
of THERESE’S mouth and holds it up to the light to read it

MRS SEMCO
(refers to the
thermometer)
What is this number I can’t read
it My eyes

THERESE reads the thermometer for MRS SEMCO

THERESE
Ninety-eight point six Perfectly
normal No fever

RICHARD
You hear that ma no fever

MRS SEMCO
My eyes is no good not my ears
You wanna plate of noodles Terry
We saved you a big plate

THERESE
I’m really not that hungry

MRS SEMCO
(she’s kidding but she’s
not )
I thought you was a smart cookie
You know that’s not the way to a
mother-in-law’s heart

RICHARD and THERESE exchange a look RICHARD’S mother has
embarrassed him

RICHARD
Ma - cut it out

MRS SEMCO

MR SEMCO appears in the kitchen doorway He wears a bowling
shirt and carries a bowling bag

MR SEMCO
(to THERESE)
You showed up Good I was tired of

France- and two tickets for passage on a ship The date of
departure March 1 1953 A pause

THERESE
Richard what is this

RICHARD beams takes one of the tickets from THERESE

RICHARD
Well that one’s mine I thought it

THERESE stares at the ticket in her hand picks up one of the
brochures full of pictures of Paris landmarks

RICHARD (CONT’D)
Jeez Terry you could cheer up a
little It’s not every day you get

summer’s a busy time there and-

THERESE
I can’t go in March

RICHARD

big plans

But this stings THERESE and RICHARD regrets saying it

RICHARD (CONT’D)
I didn’t mean - Terry you know I

I thought you wanted to go to
France With me And I figured
what the hell the sooner the
better

THERESE

A silence THERESE puts the ticket and brochure back into the
box puts the lid back on to the box

The party is in full swing - more of a crowd more LAUGHTER
boozing

THERESE stands at a window near a SMALL GROUP OF PEOPLE
including GENEVIEVE CANTRELL the woman she spotted earlier
THERESE tries to watch GENEVIEVE without being seen as a MALE
PARTY GUEST dominates

MALE PARTY GUEST

her She’s one of these real
Greenwich Village phonies if you

minute

GENEVIEVE
You’re Phil’s friend aren’t you

THERESE
I am yes And Dannie’s

GENEVIEVE

GENEVIEVE smiles - touche THERESE smiles too loosening up
enjoying the flirting

GENEVIEVE

I can see why Phil speaks so highly

of you
THERESE

Can you
GENEVIEVE

Oh definitely I can see a lot
THERESE

Really What do you see
GENEVIEVE

(gives her a good long

look)
Great - potential

GENEVIEVE hands THERESE a beer and they clink in a toast
THERESE smiles she enjoys GENEVIEVE’S attention but she
can’t hold GENEVIEVE’S gaze something about its boldness
draws her away from the moment from the party

RETURN TO

FLASHBACK DECEMBER 1952

INT FRANKENBERG’S EMPLOYEE CAFETERIA DAY

The employee Christmas party is in progress which consists
of the same old lunch plus Christmas cookies holiday music
and decorations THERESE stands next to RUBY ROBICHEK in a
long line of staff When it’s RUBY’S turn the SERVER gives
RUBY double of everything in a food box THERESE notices
this and RUBY sees her notice

RUBY ROBICHEK
When you live alone every penny
counts You economize You’1l

THERESE
How do you know I live alone

RUBY ROBICHEK

silence THERESE watches her eat She watches everybody eat
seemingly in unison THERESE slides her tray over to RUBY

THERESE
You take it I don’t feel like
eating

RUBY ROBICHEK

THERESE nods RUBY takes THERESE’S meal and shovels it into
her food box

RUBY ROBICHEK (CONT’D)

THERESE summons a smile in reply at a loss for words

EXT MIDTOWN MANHATTAN SAME DAY

From a distance we see CAROL’S car pull swiftly into a
parking space near FRED HAYMES’ law offices CAROL gets out
of the car and walks briskly down the busy street into the
building

INT HAYMES LAW OFFICES MOMENTS LATER

FRED HAYMES CAROL’S lawyer is just returning to his office
when he catches CAROL delivering a small Christmas present to
his SECRETARY

CAROL SECRETARY
Merry Christmas Katherine Ohhh

CAROL
It’s nothing I assure you (looks
up) Well there he is Now will you
talk to me

FRED HAYMES
I didn’t want you to come all the
way down here-

CAROL
Just - give it to me straight
Fred What am I not to worry about
until after the holiday

They settle inside FREDS office and FRED closes the door

FRED HAYMES
(after a beat)
Look Jerry Rix served some papers
this morning To my complete
surprise Why don’t you sit down

CAROL
Why is it people think you’re going
to take bad news better if you’re
sitting down

An awkward silence FRED clears his throat

FRED HAYMES
Harge has sought an injunction
which denies you any access to
Rindy until the custody hearing
And I’m afraid Harge has changed
his mind about joint custody He
wants sole custody of Rindy

CAROL
What

CAROL is stunned She sits

A silence

CAROL (CONTD)
Weve already reached an agreement
on custody What is this all about

FRED HAYMES
They’1l be filing papers on the
twenty-ninth in District Family
Court for the uh permanent
custody petition

CAROL
Can he do this Is it - right

FRED HAYMES
I don’t know if it’s right but
it’s legal

CAROL
On what grounds

FRED HAYMES
(stalling)
Listen Let’s - deal with this
after Christmas You’1ll have a
chance to-

CAROL
(she interrupts him)
On What Grounds

FRED HAYMES
They’re petitioning the judge to
consider a morality clause

CAROL
A morality - what the hell does
that mean

FRED HAYMES
(after a moment)
Okay I won’t mince words with you
Abby Gerhard

CAROL
Abby is Rindy’s godmother Abby
is (to herself really) Hes

If he can’t have me I can’t have
Rindy - That’s

FRED HAYMES
I’m sorry But they seem serious

CAROL looks up to FRED nods
CAROL
When’s the custody hearing

FRED HAYMES
It’s hard to say With the holidays
and a backlog of cases

CAROL
Your best guess Fred

FRED HAYMES
Not before the middle of March
Could be April

A silence

CAROL
Can I see her

FRED HAYMES
(not unkindly)
Not - let me put it this way - It
would not be advisable under the-

CAROL
At school In an office with a-

FRED HAYNES
The issue is not-

CAROL
Surely a visit supervised by a
teacher or a-

FRED HAYNES
Carol these are serious
allegations Forcing contact before
the hearing you simply invite
further scrutiny concerning your
conduct

CAROL
My conduct Jesus Christ I’m her
mother for God’s sake (beat)
Morality clause I see

FRED HAYNES
Do you

CAROL
No There’s nothing moral about
taking Rindy away from me

CAROL looks back at him in a state of frozen disbelief

EXT FIFTH AVENUE SAME AFTERNOON

CAROL reenters the street in a numbing daze She passes
crowds of Christmas SHOPPERS with places to go and things to
do She’s not one of those people She finds herself walking
back in the direction of her car through the glare of winter
light She puts a cigarette to her lips and begins searching
through her purse struggling to find a light Finally
glancing up she is struck by the sight of truck backing out
of the lot and collides with a PEDESTRIAN clearing way

A VOICE
Watchit lady

CAROL
Pardon me

CAROL turns into a shop window where she finally manages to
light her cigarette taking several deep drags Looking up
she focuses a moment on the display It’s a vacation theme
sunglasses on mannequins cameras slung around their necks
luggage stacked in artful piles She lets her gaze fall ona
large two-tone brown leather suitcase

INT RECORD SHOP EAST 50’S SAME LATE AFTERNOON

THERESE waits for a requested title at the front counter of a
midtown record store The STORE CLERK returns with her
request A Billie Holiday album with “Easy Living”
prominently displayed on its cover

THERESE
Yes that’s it thank you

She hands him a five-dollar bill and he begins ringing her
up As she waits for her change she spots two SHORT-HAIRED
WOMEN at the listening station sharing a single pair of
headphones The more mannish of the two in horn-rim glasses
leans against the railing dressed in tailored trousers and
jacket over a button-down shirt The other wears a sleekly
tailored woman’s suit very professional They are obviously
a couple of some kind New York lesbians THERESE observes
them for a moment until the woman in slacks looks over - and
THERESE quickly looks down

EXT RECORD SHOP EAST 50’S

RICHARD waiting outside with his bike turns to find THERESE
walking briskly out of the record shop

THERESE
Let’s walk I want to drop this at

Your wish is my command

They start down the block toward THERESE’s apartment

lot THERESE tries to change the subject

THERESE

portfolio you know of my
pictures Start taking portraits

newspaper Maybe at the Times
Dannie knows someone--

RICHARD

about Europe (no answer) Terry

THERESE stops brooding and RICHARD stops and turns to her

RICHARD (CONT’D)

this came from)
Whoa Never Until You

THERESE
Don’t lie You told me about those
two other girls

RICHARD

THERESE
Meaning I’m different because we
haven’t(quietly) gone all the

RICHARD

No no - that’s not what I - hey

THERESE nods They resume walking

THERESE

boy

RICHARD

(after a long beat)
No

THERESE
But you’ve heard of it

RICHARD
Of course I mean have I heard of

THERESE
I don’t mean people like that I
mean two people who just fall in

love With each other Say a boy

RICHARD
I don’t know anyone like that But
I‘1l tell you this - there’s always
some reason for it In the
background

THERESE
So you don’t think it could just -
happen to somebody just - anybody

RICHARD
No I don’t What are you saying

THERESE
No

They reach THERESE’S building RICHARD leans his bike against

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT SAME NIGHT
Someone is knocking at Therese’s door

THERESE sticks her head out of her bathroom and looks quickly
around the room She hurries out still brushing her hair and
fixing her blouse As she walks to the door she quickly
stashes the Billy Holiday record under a pillow and flips on
the phonograph (“Smoke Rings Les Paul and Mary Ford begins to
play) She takes a last look at her freshly tidied apartment
and pulls opens the door

It’s CAROL the suitcase on the floor beside her

CAROL
Your landlady let me in

CAROL lights a cigarette THERESE can do nothing for a moment
but stare Then THERESE catches sight of the suitcase which
CAROL pushes across the threshold with her foot

CAROL (CONTD)
Merry Christmas (beat) Open it

THERESE bends down to open the suitcase Inside is a brand
new camera and plenty of rolls of film

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT LATER

CAROL looks at THERESE’S photographs She takes her time
really examining them THERESE watches without crowding her -
eager for her good opinion CAROL comes to the photograph
THERESE took of her at the tree lot hung on the wall She’s
moved by it by the primacy of place THERESE has given

THERESE
It’s not that good I was rushed I
mean I can do better

CAROL

It’s perfect

Leaning against the end-table CAROL picks up a small photo
in its original cardboard frame THERESE aged 5 ata
convent school

CAROL (CONTD)
Is this you

THERESE
Yes

CAROL puts it down a bit abruptly and steps into THERESE’S
kitchen sinkdark room

CAROL
Do you keep anything in the icebox
besides photo chemicals I’m
feeling-

THERESE
Sure

THERESE heads to the icebox where she fishes out a couple of
beers She turns back to find CAROL another step away
fighting back tears

THERESE is frozen for a moment not knowing exactly what to
do She approaches CAROL but hesitates looking down at the
beers in her hand before setting them down on the counter

She proceeds gingerly putting a tentative hand on CAROL’s
shoulder squeezing it Very quietly still turned away
CAROL breaks She lowers her head as THERESE steps closer

EXT THERESE’S ROOF NIGHT

Sipping coffee from mugs CAROL saunters along the perimeter
of the roof while THERESE sits on a perch watching It’s not
much of a view but they can see the tips of the impressive
buildings the lights the cloudy night sky

THERESE
Is there any point in I don’t
know fighting it

CAROL
The injunction (beat) No

THERESE
Three months I feel - useless
Like I can’t help you or offer
anything-

CAROL
It has nothing to do with you

A pause The remark stings THERESE but she tries to conceal
it

CAROL (CONT’D)
I’m going away for a while

THERESE
When Where

CAROL
Wherever my car will take me West
Soon
THERESE can’t hide her dismay
CAROL (CONTD)
And I thought perhaps you’d like
to come with me
A beat CAROL looks directly at THERESE

CAROL (CONT’D)
Would you

A long held moment before THERESE makes a decision

THERESE
Yes Yes I would

A few flurries of snow have begun to fall

THERESE is removing her personal belongings from her locker
(some stockings scarves books) and putting them in her bag
She separates her Frankenberg’s Employee Handbook and her
slightly bloody Santa cap and places them in the locker
shelf Down at the other end of the locker room she hears
some girls approaching Beyond them she spots RUBY ROBICHEK
seated on a bench rolling up her calf-length stockings
looking more weary and alone than ever THERESE carefully
shuts her locker

EXT FRANKENBERG’S MOMENTS LATER

Through the Christmas display windows we see THERESE exit the

the taxi whisks her off we see her glance back one last time

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT CHRISTMAS EVE DAY

THERESE
-You don’t understand-

leave me alone

THERESE has surprised herself with her boldness

RICHARD
Are we over Is that what this is

THERESE
I didn’t say that But why should I
want to be with you if all you do
is argue about this

RICHARD
To say - to say for a minute you
practically want to say goodbye
because of some silly crush

THERESE
I didn’t say that You said it

RICHARD grabs his jacket and starts out the front door

RICHARD
You made me buy boat tickets I got

largely deserted city streets

THERESE
I could get used to having a whole

plan THERESE can’t wait any longer reaching under her seat
and producing her nicely wrapped gift for CAROL

assumes the shooting stance aiming directly at TOMMY’S head

I wish I could oblige you ma’am
But the tape is already on its way

That can’t be right

TOMMY TUCKER
(shrugs)
My reputation rests on my
efficiency Mrs Aird

A tense pause CAROL moves towards TOMMY He remains quite
calm still But he keeps his eye on her all the while CAROL
advances closer aiming the pistol at his head

CAROL
How do I know you’re not lying

TOMMY TUCKER
(a beat)
You don’t ma’am

CAROL tenses up putting her index finger on the trigger All
at once she whirls around to the recording equipment points
the gun to it and pulls the trigger - but the gun just
clicks She tries again but the trigger jams In utter
frustration she hurls the gun at the recording equipment
THERESE who’s been hovering by the door moves towards

and moves outside of the cabin She slumps against the

selfish because I take -

ABBY
No
Piercing silence
THERESE

This is all my fault

ABBY
Nonsense

ABBY puts out her cigarette gets up and pulls open the
curtains Cold bright sunlight streams into the room

ABBY (CONTD)
We should get going

INT ROADSIDE DINER OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO DAY
THERESE stares out the window she hasn’t touched her meal

ABBY
Eat something (no response) Suit
yourself

ABBY slides THERESE’S plate to her side of the table and
starts finishing it THERESE turns to her

THERESE
Why don’t you like me I’ve never
done anything to you

A pause ABBY starts to say something thinks better of it
She leans in towards THERESE

ABBY
You really think I’ve flown halfway
across the country to drive you
back East because I hate you and
want to see you suffer

THERESE
It’s for Carol Not for me

ABBY
(after a beat)
That’s - If you really believe that
then you’re not as smart as I
thought you were

Therese takes this in then looks up at Abby Silence

THERESE
With you and Carol what
happened

ABBY

It’s completely different - I’ve
known Carol since I was 10 years

old
(after a long beat)
It was back when we had the

furniture store Late one night My
Ford broke down near my Mother’s

house and We tried to stay up
but curled up together in my old
twin bed And that was it For a

while And then it changed It
changes Nobody’s fault (beat)
So

She opens her purse and searches inside She produces an
envelope

ABBY (CONT’D)
Here - she

THERESE
What

ABBY hands her a letter

EXT ROADSIDE DINER MOMENTS LATER

In a WIDE lonely frame we see THERESE has stepped outside the
diner to tear open the letter As she reads we hear CAROLS
voice

CAROL (VO)

Dearest There are no accidents and

he would have found us one way or

another Everything comes full

circle Be grateful it was sooner

rather than later You’1l think it

harsh of me to say so but no

explanation I offer will satisfy

you
We see ABBY leave the diner as THERESE continues reading She
climbs in the car and starts the engine A soft undertone of
MUSIC has emerged

INT ANOTHER MOTEL NIGHT

ABBY in the bathroom washing out some clothes Through a
crack in the door she spots THERESE seated on the bed
drained by tears expressionless

CAROL (VO) (CONT’D)
Please don’t be angry when I tell
you that you seek resolutions and
explanations because you’re young
But you will understand this one
day

INTEXT COUNTRY ROAD DAY

ABBY pulls the car off the road near a small grove of trees
and fading clumps of snow THERESE jumps out makes for the
trees and tries to hide herself before she throws up ABBY
lights a cigarette and remains in the car watching THERESE
from a distance

CAROL (V0) (CONT’D)
And when it happens I want you to
imagine me there to greet you like
the morning sky our lives
stretched out ahead of us a
perpetual sunrise

INT CAROL’S CAR NIGHT

ABBY at the wheel glances in the rear-view-mirror at
THERESE stretched out asleep on the back seat of the car
Distant passing lights comb over her repose

CAROL (VO) (CONT’D)
But until then there must be no
contact between us I have much to
do and you my darling even more
Please believe that I would do
anything to see you happy and so I
do the only thing I can - I release
you

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT NEW YORK DAY

THERESE in her overcoat suitcase beside her stands in the
middle of her apartment It’s full of her things but it
looks like a foreign land All the photographs on the wall
seem as if they were taken by someone else

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT THAT SAME NIGHT

THERESE hunches over her sink bathed in red light She takes
a quick deep drag of a cigarette burning in an ashtray Rows
of negatives hang from hooks underneath the kitchen
cupboards over the trays of chemicals She finds a certain
shot on the enlarger marks it and focuses She begins the
process of developing the print

Finally she watches the photo in its bath slowly appear - a
shadow here and there a shape forming - and it’s CAROL
asleep on her back her body akimbo in a tumble of sheets
one hand resting delicately

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY LATE NIGHT

THERESE is creeping down the half-lit stairway She picks up
the phone without making a sound and stares at the dial She
hangs up Then in one continuous gesture she picks it up
again and dials the number She stands frozen One long ring
Silence Another long ring Then someone picks up the line
But there’s silence on the other end

Nothing THERESE is frozen

THERESE
Hello (beat) Carol

The silence that follows is like an answer THERESE holds the
receiver close a precious thing

INT CAROL’S HOUSE KITCHEN NIGHT

CAROL in the dark on the other end still She makes a
movement as if to say something but doesn’t We see her
finger softly graze the receiver button before pressing it
down

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY PHONE NIGHT

Extremely CLOSE on THERESE hearing CAROL disconnect but
holding on in the void

THERESE
(prayerful)
I miss you I miss you

weekday lunch with everything distinctly in its place
Eisenhower’s inauguration proceedings can be heard and
glimpsed on the living room television set

JENNIFER
More mashed potatoes Carol

CAROL
Yes - Thanks They’re delicious

CAROL reaches over to take the bowl of mashed potatoes but
HARGE gets to it first spoons some out for CAROL The
atmosphere is polite but far from relaxed

CAROL (CONT’D)
Thank you (beat) I thought
perhaps Chester and Marge would
be here by now With Rindy

JENNIFER
Marge said to go ahead not to
wait

HARGE
(to CAROL)
I’m sure they’1ll be here soon

CAROL appreciates HARGE’S small kindness

JOHN
Harge tells us you’ve been getting
along quite well with your doctor
Carol

JENNIFER
And why shouldn’t she be getting on
well He’s a very expensive doctor

CAROL
He’s actually not a doctor but a
psychotherapist

JENNIFER
Well he comes very well regarded

JOHN
(to HARGE)
A Yale man like your uncle

CAROL
(ever so slightly edgy)
But that doesn’t make him a doctor
HARGE throws her a little look
CAROL (CONT’D)
I do like him Very much He’s been
a great help

JENNIFER and JOHN continue eating in silence

INT HARGE’S PARENTS HOUSE LATER

CAROL sits alone near the living room window caught ina
stare She’s jolted out of it by the sound of JENNIFER
approaching with a cup of tea CAROL turns

CAROL
Thank you Jennifer but I’m fine
really-

JENNIFER

It’ll calm your nerves

JENNIFER sets it down on a small end table and places a hand
on CAROL’s shoulder Just then we hear the sound of a car
coming up the drive

CAROL
They’re here

CAROL rises gives her hair a quick pat and starts off toward
the door

JENNIFER
Just a moment dear

CAROL stops turns JENNIFER walks over to where CAROL stands
her and adjusts her collar

CAROL manages to maintain composure then turn from JENNIFER
and continues on to the door

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT AFTERNOON

DANNIE is over helping THERESE repaint her apartment
THERESE is on a ladder painting some molding near the
ceiling and DANNIE is below As the RADIO plays (Lullaby of
Birdland” by Georges Shearing) DANNIE spots THERESE wiping
sweat from her brow They’ve clearly been at it a while

DANNIE
I think it’s break time Let me
fetch some brews

THERESE
Sounds good

DANNIE goes to the kitchen to grab some beers and an opener

THERESE has been developing more photos - almost all of them

pictures of CAROL from their trip DANNIE can’t help but take
a look

He hears something behind him and turns It’s THERESE

DANNIE
These are seriously good I mean
they really capture - whoever this
is

THERESE
They’re just practice

THERESE crosses the room and begins picking up the pictures
tidying the area

DANNIE
You really should put together a
portfolio Say the word I’1l
introduce you to my pal at the
Times There’s always a clerk job
going

THERESE shakes her head takes the pictures into the other
room and s pulls open a drawer to stash them in

DANNIE (CONT ’D)
You went away with her right

THERESE
Yes

DANNIE
So what happened

THERESE
Ohh Nothing It’s - hard to

DANNIE
(after a beat)
Is it because I tried to kiss you
that day Because if it is don’t

THERESE
I’m not afraid

THERESE is stopped a moment by her own words reminding her
of another time and place She looks back at him

THERESE (CONT’D)
Let’s finish while we still have
light okay

DANNIE shrugs and they get back to work

DANNIE
I still think you should put
together that portfolio

INT THERESE’S APARTMENT LATE NIGHT

THERESE sits on her kitchen floor sorting photographs a
cigarette burning in an ashtray beside her She’s busy
placing them into neat piles We see her older work -
LANDSCAPES STILL LIFE’S ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS - and all her
newer work - PHOTOS OF KIDS PLAYING IN THE STREET OLD WOMEN
DRAGGING SHOPPING CARTS CITY FACES - virtually all of them
depicting people At the bottom of one pile she discovers the
picture of CAROL BUYING THE XMAS TREE She considers it a
moment before pulling it out of the stack

EXT CENTRAL PARK A FEW DAYS LATER AFTERNOON

It’s a gray rainy day at the park Walkers with umbrellas

INT CAROL’S HOUSE DUSK

CAROL sits in the lantern seat off her stairway looking out
at the night From down below she hears the RADIO REPORT
blaring on announcing the death of Stalin

The radio is lowered and CAROL looks down She sees Abby
starting up the stairs with two cups of coffee CAROL starts
down to meet her

ABBY
Stay Stay

CAROL
Don’t be silly

She takes her cup from ABBY and starts back up to her seat
CAROL returns to where she was sitting and ABBY sits on the
stairs below her ABBY can read CAROL’s despondency from a
mile away

CAROL (CONTD)

ABBY reaches out puts a hand on CAROL’S foot All at once a
pair of headlights swing by lighting up the windows and
they are jolted CAROL turns and ABBY stands startled A
look between them is someone here Is this trouble And then
the headlights disappear

CAROL (CONTD)
Who the hell is turning around in
my drive

ABBY
I should go

CAROL
You don’t have to-

ABBY
-I do

ABBY squeezes CAROL’S hand - courage And they start down the
stairs together

the river to New Jersey

THERESE’s thoughts seem to harden and a brief darkness falls
over her

THERESE
Use what feels right Throw away
the rest

DANNIE
(laughs)
Where’d that come from

THERESE
Something Carol once said to me

DANNIE
(a beat then)

THERESE struggles for this

THERESE
I can’t - go Back To that place
Where you keep it all locked up
the sadness shame You let
people down You let yourself -
down So you cry and you hide
and think - things constantly

THERESE (CONTD)
if you stare at the phone long
enough or - take a train and
just lurk it could all
return (Silence) And then one day
the phone is just a phone A train
going to Jersey is just a train to
Jersey You stop - crying and
hiding And you know you’re able to
use things and throw them away

The river looks like a swath of black cellophane

CUT BACK TO

INT PHIL’S APARTMENT NIGHT (APRIL 1953)

THERESE sits on the edge of the bathtub next to the open
window taking in the air She can hear the party in
progress people having a great time but she’s not ready to
rejoin them A couple of RAPID KNOCKS on the door

THERESE

And GENEVIEVE’S off THERESE watches her wind her way to the
door

RETURN TO

FLASHBACK EARLIER THE SAME DAY MID-APRIL 1953

EXT 41ST STREET and BROADWAY MORNING

Through passing cars and car windows we suddenly see THERESE
dressed for work in a smart dark suit hurrying through the
morning commuter CROWD towards the New York Times building
Her style of hair and dress has taken on a sophistication and
maturity we can’t help but associate with CAROL

INT TAXI TIMES SQUARE MORNING

CAROL in the cab on her way to FRED HAYMES’S office is
looking distantly out the window when she suddenly spots her
The light changes and the taxi starts to move - THERESE
flickers from view CAROL looks back over her shoulder
through reflections

INT ELEVATORJERRY RIX LAW OFFICES DAY

CAROL turned away inside the elevator The doors open She
turns to look a moment before heading out the door and down
the hall

Gathered inside HARGE RIX FRED HAYMES and a STENOGRAPHER
all turn and note her arrival

INT JERRY RIX LAW OFFICES DAY MOMENTS LATER
Everyone is gathered around the conference table

JERRY RIX
Well-(coughs)- we feel given the
seriousness of the charges and the
incontestability of the evidence
my client has every reason to
expect a compliant and favorable
outcome

FRED HAYMES
Not so fast Jerry My client’s
psychotherapist is perfectly
satisfied with her recovery from
the events of the winter asserting
she’s more than capable of caring
for her child She’s had no further
contact with Therese Belivet

(MORE)

FRED HAYMES (CONTD)
And we have sworn depositions from
two Saddlebrook Institute
psychiatrists clearly stating that
in their opinions a series of
events precipitated by my client’s
husband drove her to suffer an
emotional break which resulted in
this - described behavior

HARGE
(looks to his lawyer for
help)
That’s absurd - Are they serious-
JERRY RIX

Alright Fred - okay if this is
how you’re going to play this-

FRED HAYMES
Furthermore given the manner in
which these tapes were obtained and
recorded we’re confident in their
inadmissability-

JERRY RIX
Okay okay First off Id like to
see these depositions And second-

CAROL
(interrupts him)
Fred - please Don’t - May I speak

A silence as everybody in the room looks to CAROL

CAROL (CONTD)
I wont deny the truth of what’s
contained in those tapes

FRED HAYMES
(signals to the
STENOGRAPHER )
This is off the record honey

CAROL
Might as well be on the record

A pause as JERRY nods to the STENOGRAPHER to continue and
CAROL pours herself a glass of water

CAROL (CONTD) (CONTD)
I wanted - I did want - to talk

about duty sacrifice That
was what I-(beat) But now that
I’m here I don’t I don’t know
what I believe Or what I even

know except that
(MORE )

CAROL (CONT’D)
I know I want to see my daughter -
to hear her voice Always To be
there when she’s-

She stops holding back tears which she refuses to allow
Gathering herself she levels her eyes directly to Harge and
makes her case directly to him

CAROL (CONTD)

Harge I want you to be happy I
didn’t give you that - I failed you
- we both could have given

More (beat) But we gave each other
Rindy and that’s - the most -
breathtaking the most
generous of gifts (beat) So why
are we spending so much time
coming up with ways to keep her
from each other (beat) What
happened with Therese I wanted
I won’t deny it or-

HARGE looks down

CAROL (CONTD)
But I do regret I - grieve

the mess we’re about to make of
our child’s life We Harge we
are both i - Let’s

set it right (beat) I want Harge

to have permanent custody-

Amidst the sudden chaos HARGE’s eyes take hold of her and
don’t let up

FRED HAYMES JERRY RIX
Let’s take a break folks and Fred - no I think your
resume when I’ve had a moment client has made it perfectly
to confer with my- clear given her statement-

CAROL

No Fred Let me have my say

Because - if you stop me I

wont be able to cope

CAROL stands stepping away from the table to regain her
composure Silence returns before she continues

CAROL (CONT’D)
I’m no martyr I have no clue
whats best for me But I do
know I feel I feel it in my
bones what’s best for my
daughter

She starts to turn and walk again addressing HARGE

CAROL (CONTD)
(beat) I want visits with her
Harge I don’t care if they’re
supervised But they need to be
regular (beat) There was a time
I would have locked myself away -
done most anything just to keep
Rindy with me But what use am I
to her to us living
against my own grain Rindy
deserves - joy How do I give her
that not knowing what it means
myself

She pours herself another glass of water

CAROL (CONTD)
That’s the deal Take it or leave
it I can’t - I won’t negotiate
If you leave it we go to court
and it gets ugly We’re not ugly
people Harge

Feeling suddenly shaky she turns and starts out of the room
HARGE stands staring at her as she goes as FRED leaps to
his feet and hurries after her calling her name

EXT COFFEE SHOP SEVENTH AVENUE DAY

Through reflections we see CAROL seated at a table writing a
note Beside her a pot of coffee and cigarette burning in an
ashtray She signs it Seals it inside an envelope and
begins gathering her things

INT NEW YORK TIMES PHOTO DEPARTMENT DAY

THERESE organizes black and white prints during a meeting of
photo editors gathered around a large table Smoke in the
air Through the glass a MESSENGER is seen speaking to a
CLERK The CLERK spots THERESE inside the room and brings her
the envelope

CLERK
Belivet

THERESE looks up and hurries over to the CLERK by the door
He hands her the envelope

CLERK (CONT’D)
Hand delivered Swank

THERESE takes the envelope and returns to the table Glancing
down she recognizes CAROL’S handwriting

INT NEW YORK TIMES PHOTO DEPARTMENT LATER

THERESE types labels at her cubicle The open note sits
beside her on her desk She stops typing and looks over at
the note She picks it up and holds it for a moment before
crumpling it up and tossing it into a desk drawer She
returns to typing

INT RITZ TOWER HOTEL NIGHT

CAROL is entering the hotel from the street entrance
removing her scarf and adjusting her hair She makes her way
to the pay telephones and slips inside an empty booth There
we see her dial a number and make a quick call She hangs up
takes out her compact and powders her nose She steps out of
the booth and stops

INT RITZ TOWER HOTEL BARLOUNGE NIGHT

There across the room is THERESE being shown to a corner
table THERESE looking more grown-up and put together
THERESE thanking the MAITRE D’ THERESE sitting down CAROL
takes a breath then makes her way across the room

THERESE looks up and sees her

CAROL
I wasn’t sure you’d come It’s nice
of you to see me

THERESE
Don’t say that

CAROL settles in opposite THERESE moving her coat aside

CAROL
Do you hate me Therese

THERESE
No How could I hate you

CAROL
I suppose you could Didn’t you
For a while

THERESE looks down She pours herself some tea

CAROL (CONT’D)
Abby tells me you’re thriving
Youve no idea how pleased I am for
you (beat) You look very fine you
know As if you’ve suddenly
blossomed Is that what comes of
getting away from me

THERESE
(answers quickly)
No

She frowns regretting answering so quickly and looking
down When she looks up again CAROL is staring at her
quite intently

THERESE (CONT’D)
What

CAROL
Nothing I was just thinking about
that day In the doll department

THERESE
I always wondered Why did you
come over to me

CAROL
Because you were the only girl not
busy as hell (beat) Disappointed

THERESE shakes her head no CAROL smiles at the memory and
lights a cigarette

CAROL (CONT’D)
Harge and I are selling the house
I’ve taken an apartment On Madison
Avenue And a job believe it or
not I’m going to work for a
furniture house on Fourth Avenue as
a buyer Some of my ancestors must
have been carpenters

THERESE gives CAROL a little smile - a bit of thaw

THERESE
Have you seen Rindy

CAROL
(after a beat)
Once or twice At the lawyer’s
office She sat on my lap and we
(holding THERESE’S gaze) She’s
going to live with Harge For now
It’s the right thing

CAROL can’t quite cover the pain of this but she tries

CAROL (CONTD)
Anyway the apartment’s a nice big
one - big enough for two I was
hoping you might like to come and
live with me but I guess you
won’t (beat) Would you

A held breath

THERESE

No I don’t think so
CAROL

That’s your decision
THERESE

Yes

A silence

CAROL

I’m meeting some people from the
furniture house at the Oak Room at
nine If you want to have dinner
if you change your mind I think--
you’d like them (beat) Well

That’s that

CAROL puts out her cigarette stares at her cigarette lighter
on the table

CAROL (CONT’D)
I love you

A silence THERESE wants to say something but can’t

OS JACK TAFT
Therese Is that you

And the moment is gone THERESE looks up turns towards the
source of the greeting

It’s a smiling JACK TAFT halfway across the room near the
bar

JACK
What do you know (starts over) Im
saying to myself I know that girl

THERESE watches JACK make his way over to her She gives
CAROL a quick look - CAROL staring down at the table not

knowing what to do vulnerable THERESE rises to greet
JACK
THERESE
Jack
JACK

Gee but it’s great to see you It’s
been well months

THERESE
Months

CAROL lights a cigarette THERESE glances at her and they

hold a look for a moment before THERESE speaks

THERESE (CONT’D)
Jack this is Carol Aird

JACK holds out his hand CAROL shakes it

JACK
Pleased to meet you

CAROL
Likewise

CAROL retreats back to her own thoughts smokes

JACK
Hey Ted Gray’s meeting me here and

CAROL

And she’s gone THERESE doesn’t move doesn’t turn around to
watch CAROL leave

JACK (CONTD)

Alright well let me go make sure
the loaf is on his way Back ina
flash

And JACKS off to the phone booth A beat before THERESE
turns around She scans the bar and beyond for CAROL but
she’s not there THERESE walks to the lobby entrance - she
scans the lobby - but CAROL is well and truly gone - and it
only now hits THERESE that she let CAROL walk away THERESE
turns and makes her way to the LADIES ROOM in a bit of a
daze

INT RITZ TOWER HOTEL LADIES ROOM NIGHT

THERESE stands at the sink water running She can barely
bring herself to look into the mirror She splashes cold
water on her face

INT PHIL’S APARTMENT NIGHT

THERESE threads her way through PHIL’S GUESTS on her way to
the front door - it’s no easy task navigating especially
since no one seems to notice THERESE or anything other than
their own good time When she finally reaches the door
THERESE takes a look back into the living room to see if
she’s missed out on any good-byes She spots DANNIE and
LOUISE on the floor knees-up to PHIL’S small black and white
TV set intently watching a film oblivious to the noise
around them DANNIE jots notes every once in a while in his
little notebook All seems right here - for others at least
THERESE slips out the door

EXT GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET NIGHT

THERESE walks down a quaint cobbled street It’s a lovely
night and there are various PEDESTRIANS out strolling It
seems to THERESE that she’s the only person who isn’t
smiling isn’t engaged with someone who’s actually beside her
on such a lovely evening She looks at the palm of her hand
checks the address keeps walking As she approaches the
address THERESE spots an ELDERLY COUPLE arm in arm
supporting each other walking down the street towards her
They look like they’ve been together for ever the ELDERLY
WOMAN leaning in to her husband as they pass the ELDERLY MAN
tipping his hat to THERESE

We HEAR SHARP LAUGHTER from a nearby apartment and THERESE
turns to see GENEVIEVE CANTRELL lean backwards out of a
window She holds a bottle of champagne which spills down
into the street below

GENEVIEVE gestures to someone inside and ANOTHER WOMAN joins
GENEVIEVE at the window - the two begin to make out THERESE
watches their embrace for a moment it’s tremendously sexy
GENEVIEVE pulls the WOMAN back into the apartment and the
window’s slammed shut behind them The night is suddenly very
quiet THERESE looks off in the direction the ELDERLY COUPLE
took She starts walking away from GENEVIEVE toward
something else She begins to walk more quickly and more
quickly still brushing past the world of strangers

INT THE OAK ROOM PLAZA HOTEL NIGHT

THERESE winded enters the restaurant A WAITER stops her

WAITER

Do you have a reservation
THERESE

I’m looking for someone
WAITER

I’m sorry ma’am I can’t seat you

without-—

She moves away from the WAITER and scans the crowded room
Nothing Then out of the corner of her eye almost
imperceptible at first at a table towards the rear of the
room she sees a woman’s blonde head thrown back in laughter
the woman seems to be encapsulated in or protected by a haze
of light and smoke It’s CAROL CAROL as THERESE has always
seen her and as she will see her evermore in SLOW MOTION
like in a dream or a single defining memory substantial yet
elusive She moves towards her CAROL raises a wine glass to
her lips and as she does she turns slightly and spots
