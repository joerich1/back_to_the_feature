TO
TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY)

Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd carrying
an accordion file under his arm like a football

Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP
Jamey trots up a marble staircase two steps at a time
TO

JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR FOOTSTEPS
making a racket

Jamey rushes toward a door marked JUDGE TATE
RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tates chambers

JOSEPH MILLER (OS)
This construction site is
causing mortal and irreparable
harm to an unsuspecting public

ANDREW BECKETT (OS)
My client has one of the finest
and most respected safety records
in the business Your Honor

Jamey shoves open the door REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO
CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE ANDREW BECKETT
(in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes)

JUDGE TATE
One at a time Mr Miller

JOE
Your Honor since Rockwell Corp
began construction the
surrounding residential
neighborhood has been enshrouded
in a cloud of foul-smelling
germ-carrying pestilent dust
My client is being forced to
breathe known carcinogens daily
Other residents are coming forth
on a daily basis to add their
voices of outrage

ANDREW
Your Honor I submit there were
no complaints until Counselor
began knocking on doors
drumming up business And the
dust which Counselor refers to
has appeared on only three
occasions Each time it has
been examined and the results

Behind his back Andrew wiggles his fingers Jamey stuffs
a document into Andrews hand

ANDREW (CONT )
Limestone Messy but innocuous

Andrew submits the report to the Judge

JOE
Innocuous

ANDREW
Defined by Websters as harmless

JOE
I know what it means Your
Honor imagine how the children
in this neighborhood have been
made to feel The pounding of
construction ringing in their
ears as this skyscraper a
tribute to mankinds greed
grows daily casting an ominous
shadow over their lives filling
them with dread even as they are
surrounded in a black toxic
fog blocking out the sun while
poisoning their lungs And
Counselor calls it harmless

His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE Andrew mouths to
Jamey Not bad But he whips around serious again

ANDREW
Your Honor Counselor is
attempting to portray my client
as a hideous manifestation of
evil and corruption But
nothing could be further from
the truth Rockwell has
generously contributed ten
thousand dollars to this
neighborhoods schools clinics
and youth centers Granting a
restraining order on the
construction site will throw
hundreds of Philadelphians out
of work and will lend
validation to this contemptible
and groundless nuisance suit
which speaks directly to the
kind of greed and treachery that
today is threatening the very
fabric of our society

Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers

JUDGE TATE
Lets not go off the deep end
gentlemen I thought we were
talking about some dust

Chinese food (NOTE The library may be equipped with a

computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference rather
than a book)
Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks finding a

CUT ON LAUGHTER TO

THE RECEPTION AREA (INTNIGHT) A DOMINOS PIZZA DELIVERY

Seidman Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide

carpeted staircase Wheeler finishes a story and everyone
LAUGHS

CUT TO
A BOX OF CIGARS BEING HANDED AROUND (INTNIGHT)

SEIDMAN
Andys expressed a keen interest
in the Kronos Inc situation
Charles Is that correct Andy

The lawyers have gathered in Wheelers spacious office with
its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline

ANDREW
The fate of the participants
interests me yes sir

Wheeler Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of
preparing cigars to be smoked snipping the ends with a brass
clip rolling them over their tongues to wet them sliding the
cigars in and out of their rounded mouths

Andrew holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it watches
with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye

Wheeler leans back in his chair swirling a brandy snifter
He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure

KENTON
Its good to be King hey
Charles
WHEELER
Kings are out of fashion Id
rather be thought of asa
benevolent tyrant
(prompting Andrew)
Its an anti-trust action

ANDREW
It is and it isnt Charles
Macrosystems new software
copies all the best-known
elements of Kronos spreadsheet
program If theyre allowed to
sell it Kronos will get undersold
right out of business For me the
legal principle involved is
copyright infringement

WHEELER
Bearing in mind that Bill
Wright the chairman of
MacroSystems is a close personal
friend of mine which side of
this mess would you desire to be
on Andy And dont allow my very
tight personal relationship with
Bill to influence your answer in
any way

Andrew knows this is a test And he loves it

ANDREW
Sorry Charles but

Andrew is distracted -- BY A LIGHT FALLING ACROSS HIS FACE

ANDREW (CONT )
Id like to see Kronos win

Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp so that its LIGHT FALLS
ACROSS ANDREWS FACE REVEALING a faint purple blotch
about the size of a quarter much like the blotches we saw
on the HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrews doctors office

KENTON
Why Beckett

ANDREW
Because they deserve to Walter

Andrew lifts his hand finding that his hair has been pushed
back revealing the blotch
He stands nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to
cover the blotch

ANDREW (CONT )
If MacroSystems wins an energetic
young company will be destroyed
five thousand Americans will be
out of work Moreover the laws of
copyright and anti-trust were
enacted to prevent exactly the
kind of bullshit Macrosystems is
trying to pull

SEIDMAN
Andy do you know who reps Kronos
Inc

ANDREW

Bailey Brackman

WHEELER
Get with the program Andy As
of this evening about 805 this

JOE
Youre in trouble

(NOTE Joe IS SEEN IN HIS OFFICE or LEANING AGAINST A
WINDOW IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM whenever he speaks)

ANDREW
I know that Charles

WHEELER
More than your friend Family

JOE
Big trouble

ANDREW

Charles I must apologize again
for the Kronos mishap

(smiling)
It was a scary few minutes
around here Wow But thank
God the complaint was found
And no damage was done

KENTON
This time What about next time

ANDREW
There wont be a next time I

guarantee it

WHEELER
Andy It seems that something
has come over you lately A
kind of stupor a fogginess
a lack of focus Earth to
Andy Anybody home

KENTON
Helloooo

KILLCOYNE
Thats right Andy The last
four five months youve seemed
really out of it

SEIDMAN
At least different somehow
ANDREW
(keeping it positive)
Perhaps youre right Ive

certainly been busy With the
Kronos complaint a preliminary
injunction hearing and the
Saunders trial all falling at the
same time

KENTON
Some people think you have an
attitude problem Beckett

ANDREW
Really Who thinks that sir

WHEELER
I do

Wheeler seems very grave

ANDREW
I had no idea there was a concern
in that area Hey
(a smile)
Tll get to work on it right away

NO ONE else smiles

WHEELER
Weve been talking it over Andy
Your future that is We feel that

because we respect you so much we
have to be honest with you
ANDREW
Honesty is always best

SEIDMAN
Do you really think so Andy

ANDREW
Yes Bob I do
(to the group)
Excuse me Am I being fired

WHEELER
Lets put it this way Andy
your place in the future of this
firm is no longer secure

JOE
In a word yes

WHEELER
We dont think its fair to keep
you here where your future is
limited But we wish you luck
Andy all the luck in the world

Wheeler rises wearing a friendly smile

WHEELER (CONT)
And I hate to rush you out of
here but

JOE
But hes got lots of other
peoples lives to ruin

WHEELER
weve got a committee meeting

ANDREW
Excuse me Charles With all
due respect this is

preposterous It doesnt make
any sense it sounds as if were
talking about someone else
Pardon the lack of humility but
Ive had the distinct impression
I was kind of one of the
rising stars around here And I
feel that wasnt just my
imagination And I also think I
deserve to know whats really
going on here Charles
KENTON
Oh youre right Beckett you
dont have an attitude problem

WHEELER
Take it easy Walter

ANDREW
If youd lost confidence in me
why did you give me the Kronos suit

WHEELER
I hoped the challenge would
improve your performance You
could say it was a carrot

ANDREW
A carrot

JOE
I buy that

ANDREW
As in the vegetable

SEIDMAN

(suddenly emotional)
Andy you nearly blew the case
for Gods sake That alone is
inexcusable It would have been
catastrophic for us Put
yourself in our shoes Andy
Theres no coming back from an
error like that regardless of
who you are

(softer)
Im sorry Andy

Andrew FREEZES -- the full nature of this situation hitting
home He looks each of the PARTNERS in the eye

Okay Explain to me like Ima
two year old because theres an
element to this I cant get
through my thick head Didnt
you have an obligation to inform
your employer you had this
dreaded deadly infectious
disease

Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short to
disguise the effects of chemo

ANDREW
The law says people with
disabilities cannot be
terminated so long as they can
perform the duties required by
their position

JOE
Okay okay They discover you
have this horrible disgusting
terminal illness and they
panic for any number of
perfectly valid reasons
Theyre frightened for
themselves their families
Maybe its the homo angle
Maybe they dont want to rub
elbows with someone whos just
popped out of the closet with a
terminal case of acne And how
do they explain your status to
the client for Chrissake

ANDREW
Joe from the day I arrived to
the day they fired me I
performed consistently
thoroughly and with absolute
excellence And if they hadnt
fired me thats what Id be
doing today

JOE
Okay They want you out Its
against the law to fire you for
having AIDS so they make you
look like a fuck up Which
leads us to the mysterious lost
file

ANDREW
They sabotaged me

JOE
I knew you were going to say
that I dont buy it and I
dont see a case

ANDREW
Look I know I have a case If
you dont want to take it for
personal reasons

JOE
Correct I dont

Andrew rises thoroughly business-like

Dr

JOE
I didnt have contact What do you
consider contact We were sitting
in the same room three four
feet What if you shake hands
Wait I know the answer Only sex
or sharing needles I know that
We didnt shake hands anyway

Armbruster squeezes the blood pressure pump

DR ARMBRUSTER
The HIV virus can only be transmitted
through the exchange of bodily
fluids namely blood and semen

JOE
Right

Joe begins rolling down his sleeve

Dr

DR ARMBRUSTER
Leave that

JOE
Yeah but Doc isnt it true they
keep finding out new things about
this disease So you tell me today
theres no danger and I go home
and I hold my baby and six months
from now I hear on the news whoops
We were wrong You can carry it on
your clothes your skin and now Ive
got to worry about my kid What

Armbruster has been preparing a syringe

DR ARMBRUSTER
Were going to draw blood

JOE
Why are we going to do that

DR ARMBRUSTER
Joe I dont care a whit about your
private life
JOE
You want to give me an AIDS test

Joe HOPS off the table

JOE (CONT)
The guy sat in my office You cant
get AIDS that way right

DR ARMBRUSTER
Right

JOE
It doesnt travel through the
air by breathing or touching
right

DR ARMBRUSTER
Not by touching or shaking hands
or hugging using the same toilet
Even kissing someone with AIDS is
safe But it theres something in
your past youre worried about

JOE
Thanks Doc but I dont need an
AIDS test Are you crazy But
thanks for the information Really

Joe throws on his jacket opens the door then TURNS BACK

removes notepads and pens from his briefcase He takes out a

Joe slides to the far end of his table stacking seven or
eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him

JOES POV PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS

Andrew opens a book taking notes Rubs his eyes Writes

A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew

LIBRARIAN

ANDREW
Thank you
Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains
LIBRARIAN

We have a private research room

Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE Now other PATRONS are watching

LIBRARIAN
Wouldnt you be more comfortable in
a research room

ANDREW
(pleasantly)
No But would it make you more
comfortable
LIBRARIAN

Whatever sir

The LIBRARIAN turns away shrugging to a PATRON indicating
shes done all she can do

As Joe continues to watch one of Andrews NEIGHBORS picks
up his books and moves away

Joe rises gliding down an aisle of books keeping one eye
on Andrew who concentrates on his work

Joe approaches nonchalantly as if he just happens to be
sauntering by Suddenly he notices Andrew

JOE
Oh Beckett Hows it goin

ANDREW
Fine

Andrew goes back to his work

JOE
Whod you get

ANDREW

JOE

ANDREW

JOE

ANDREW
Rayisha Very nice

Andrew focuses on his work Joe steps away
Joe comes back

JOE
How did they find out

ANDREW
(a second then)
One of the partners spotted a
lesion on my forehead

Nearby a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up startled when she
hears the word lesion

JOE
Uh huh

Andrew concentrates on his work once more

JOE (CONT)
How do you get from one lawyer
spotting a lesion which could
have been a bruise to the
partners deducing you had AIDS
and basing a decision to
terminate you on that
conclusion

The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away

ANDREW
Good point

Andrew removes a legal pad with KENTON written in big
letters across the top and lots of notes underneath

ANDREW (CONT )
The partner who spotted the
lesion Walter Kenton used to
work for Benton Myers in DC
Theres a paralegal there Maria
Torres Shes had lesions on
and off for three years She
says it was common knowledge
around the office that her

lesions were caused by AIDS

JOE
They didnt fire her

ANDREW
No They didnt fire her

Andrew goes back to his work Joe stands there

JOE
So Kenton connected the lesion
and whatever suspicions he had about
your personal life to this
woman Maria and blew the
whistle on you Suddenly youre
losing files and its time to
let you go But up to this
point youve been their Golden

JOE (VO) (CONT)
Although the ruling did not
address the specific issue of
HIV and AIDS discrimination
DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER Andrew and Joe face each
other at their table but NO ONE ELSE remains at that table
or at the table next to it

ANDREW (VO)
Subsequent decisions have held
that AIDS is protected as a
handicap under law not only
because of the physical
limitations it imposes

DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO
NIGHT) Joe pacing Andrew reading Their section of the
library is COMPLETELY EMPTY but for Andrew and Joe

ANDREW (VO) (CONT)
But because the prejudice
surrounding AIDS exacts a social
death which precedes the actual
physical one

DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE LATER Andrew and Joe sit on the
same side of the table reading the same book

JOE (VO)
This is the essence of
discrimination formulating
opinions about others not based
on their individual merits but
rather on their membership in a
group with assumed characteristics

JUDGE GARNETT
(to Joe)
Youre outnumbered four to one
(to the others)
Whom do I address
I cant talk to four lawyers at
once

BELINDA
Im chief litigator Your Honor

JUDGE GARNETT
Fine Ive asked the litigants to be
present for this conference in the
hope we can settle this matter
today among ourselves There is
nothing I hate more than to see
lawyers suing each other If you
look at the opinion polls when Mr
John Q Citizen is asked to rank
professions according to the
respect he holds for them Where
are the lawyers Somewhere below
personal fitness trainers and only
slightly above child pornographers
If we keep suing each other if we
fail to settle the smallest
difference among ourselves with
mutual respect if we continue to
scrap like bucks in heat well
fall lower on that list And when
people lose respect for lawyers
they lose respect for the law And
when this society loses all respect
for the law well be murdered in
our beds my friends our cherished
institutions will be burned to the
ground and our children and our
grandchildren will live like
savages

JOE
If it please Your Honor we hope to
settle this matter

JUDGE GARNETT
By God you will settle it If you
force this case to trial young man
youll regret it for the rest of
your natural-born days

Now Joseph What would you

require to settle this matter
today

JOE
Reinstatement at full salary
Back pay covering the period of
unemployment and

JUDGE GARNETT
Hold it Joe
(to Wheeler)
He wants to come back to work
Chuck

WHEELER
Thats impossible Your Honor

JUDGE GARNETT
Thats impossible Joe

BELINDA CONINE
If it please Your Honor were
prepared to offer a cash
settlement of twenty-five
thousand dollars

JOE
Your generosity overwhelms me
Belinda considering my client
was earning over a hundred thou
when he was terminated almost six
months ago

JUDGE GARNETT
Give me a break Joe Lets cut
through these false attitudes
Give them a figure How much do
you want

ANDREW
I want to go back to work Your
Honor

JUDGE GARNETT
Youre here at my indulgence
young man Im waiting for a
figure Joe
Andrew and Joe confer with each other

JOE

Based on what my client would
have earned over the next three
years including benefits and
projected raises and the
extraordinary cost of medical
care for someone with Acquired
Immune Deficiency Syndrome
We would settle today for the
very fair amount of one million
five hundred thousand dollars

JUDGE GARNETT
Very good Joe Now Belinda
Ive got a figure over here of
one million five I

Andrew WHISPERS to Joe who interrupts the Judge

JOE
One more thing Your Honor

ANDREW
(jumping in)
Any settlement agreement must
include and this is critical
a letter of exoneration making
clear my termination had nothing
to do with the quality of my work

Charles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine

BELINDA CONINE
Your Honor Mr Becketts
incompetence nearly sabotaged a
350 million dollar suit

ANDREW
I was the one who was sabotaged

BELINDA CONINE
We have complaints about Mr
Becketts lack of preparation
his disorganization his
arrogant defensive attitude
The list goes on

JEROME GREEN
We have letters
Andrew saunters out

JOE
Why havent you produced these
letters

JUDGE GARNETT

Take it easy

(to Wheeler)
Whats the big deal Chuck The
boy wants a letter to show to
his mother for her to keep after
hes gone Why are you being hard-
assed about this

WHEELER
I wish I could exonerate you Andy
But Id have to lie to do it

ANDREW

(very calm)
You can save it for the jury
Charles I want to hear you say
under oath in front of a judge and
a jury Ima bad lawyer

ANDREW

Walter

KENTON
Youll be sorry Beckett

WHEELER

theirs

Joe crosses the courtroom coming to stand in front of
ANDREW whose appearance has changed thinner paler than weve

There are certain points in our
version that I must prove to
you Point number one Andrew
Beckett was is a brilliant
lawyer A great lawyer Point
number two Andrew Beckett
afflicted with a debilitating
disease made the legal
understandable personal choice
to keep the fact of his illness
to himself Point number three
His employers discovered his
illness And ladies and gentlemen
the illness Im referring to is
AIDS

his partners in moral ethical
human terms When they fired
Andrew Beckett because he had
AIDS they broke the law

Andrew Beckett represented your
company in a lawsuit in 1990 is
that correct

LAIRD
Wyant Wheeler represented us

Andrew glances toward the jury box the MARINE JUROR writes ina
tiny notebook

JOE
But Andrew Beckett was in charge of
litigation for the suit

LAIRD
Thats correct

JOE
Were you pleased with his work

LAIRD
We were satisfied

Joe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Lairds response surprises and
disappoints them

JOE
Were you satisfied or were you
pleased
Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering

LAIRD
We were satisfied

Joe refers to legal documents

JOE
Mr Laird when I approached you
about being a witness at this
trial and you agreed you gave
sworn testimony in a deposition
Is that correct

LAIRD
Thats correct

JOE
According to the deposition you
said you were thrilled impressed
overwhelmed by the quality of
Andrew Becketts work Do you
remember saying that

LAIRD
I may have said something like
that But thats not how I feel at
this moment

Joe takes on a street-tough tone

JOE
Okay Mr Laird Explain this to
me like Im a four year old Did
Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit
for you or not

LAIRD
We won

JOE
Did that thrill impress and
overwhelm you

LAIRD
It satisfied me

Joe STARES at the guy
JOE

Its a long way between being
overwhelmed and being satisfied
A cheeseburger may be satisfying
whereas caviar and champagne and
roast duck and baked Alaska for
dessert might be considered
overwhelming Do you agree

LAIRD
I might

JOE
Five months ago you characterized
Andrew Beckett as caviar and now
youre calling him a cheeseburger
Your standards have shifted a
great deal and Id like to know
why youve changed your mind

thought to the subject and thats
how I feel now

organ This does not escape the MARINES notice

The MARINE says nothing

ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT)

You were aware when you worked
with Maria Torres that she had
AIDS correct

KENTON
She didnt try to conceal it

JOE
So you are aware of the
difference between a lesion and
a bruise is that correct

KENTON
I know the difference That
doesnt mean Im always able to
recognize the difference

JOE
But didnt you avoid contact
with Ms Torres after you found
out she had AIDS She says you
acted repulsed by her and you

and some
avoided her is that correct

KENTON
I felt and still feel nothing
but the deepest sympathy and
compassion for people like
Maria who have contracted this
terrible disease through no
fault of their own

Wyant Wheeler had aggressively

most prestigious firm in
Philadelphia full of
opportunity And I was
impressed by the partners

JOE
Including Charles Wheeler

(Andrew frequently wipes sweat from his forehead with a
handkerchief His voice is hoarse raspy)

ANDREW
Particularly Charles

ANGLE ON WHEELER

JOE
What impressed you about him

ANDREW
He was the kind of person I
thought I wanted to be

What kind of person is that

ANDREW

Possessed of an encyclopedic
knowledge of the law A razor
sharp litigator a genuine
leader gifted at bringing out
the very best in others An
awesome ability to illuminate
the most complex of legal
concepts to colleagues
courtrooms the person on the
street

(a smile)
The kind of person
who plays three sets of tennis but
doesnt sweat But underneath the
elegant surface was an
adventurous spirit

Belinda Conine MAKES A NOTE ABOUT THAT

JOE
Obviously at this time you
werent sick

ANDREW
Its possible I was infected with
the HIV virus at that time but I
wasnt diagnosed until several years
later

Joe sits with a stone-sober expression this isnt easy

BELINDA
When Approximately what year did

ANDREW
I guess it was 1984 85

BELINDA
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985
that there was a fatal disease
out there called AIDS and that
you could contract it through
sexual activity

ANDREW
Its impossible to know exactly
when or how I was infected with HIV
BELINDA
But you were having anonymous
sex in porno theaters in 1984
and 1985

ANDREW
That happened once People
werent talking about AIDS then
the way we are now Or safe
sex

BELINDA
Youd heard of AIDS in 1984 85

ANDREW
Id heard of something The gay
plague gay cancer but we

didnt know how you could get it
or that it could kill you

CLOSE SHOT ON ANDREW -- losing strength

BELINDA (OS)

Do you need a break

ANDREW
No

While you were employed at Wyant
Wheeler you did everything you
could to make sure no one knew
you were an active homosexual
correct

ANDREW
That is not correct I never lied
about it

BELINDA

Did you keep a picture of your
lover on your desk

ANDREW
No

BELINDA
Do other lawyers at the firm keep
pictures of their spouses or
fiances on their desks

to conceal ones sexuality is
that right

In some situations

BELINDA
Isnt it true you have spent your
life pretending to be something
youre not so much so that the
art of concealment and dishonesty
has become second nature to you

JOE
Objection

Ill withdraw it Mr Beckett
Were you living with Miguel
Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you
had your anonymous sexual encounter
in the porn theater

You could have infected him isnt
that right

Miguel has not been infected As
I said we werent aware of AIDS
then or how it is spread

BELINDA
Really

ANDREW
Yes
Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead

BELINDA
Youve testified the lesions on
your face were visible to the
people you worked with correct

ANDREW
Thats right

BELINDA
And its your contention that
when the partners were made
aware of the lesions they
jumped to the conclusion you had
AIDS and fired you

ANDREW
Absolutely

BELINDA
Do you have any lesions on your
face at this time

ANDREW
One Here in front of my ear

An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror She holds it
before Andrew

BELINDA
Remembering you are under oath

ANDREW
Yes On my torso

JOE
If it please the court Id like
to ask Mr Beckett to
remove his shirt so that the
jury can have an accurate idea
of what were talking about
BELINDA
We object Your Honor It would
unfairly influence the jury

JOE

Your Honor if Mr Beckett was
forced by his illness to use a
wheelchair would the defense
ask him to park it outside
Were talking about AIDS were
talking about lesions Lets

see what were talking about

ANGLE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY -- LOOKING APPREHENSIVE

removing your shirt Mr
Beckett

CUT TO
CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM CHARLES WHEELER -- ON THE STAND

BELINDA
Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett
to your firm

Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate
Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity

WHEELER
If youre the owner of a major
league ball club you recruit the
hot rookie And Andy was tremendously
promising as a young attorney
Thats why we went after him
thats why we hired him and
thats why we stuck with him
year after year waiting for
the promise to be fulfilled But
it never was

BELINDA
You kept giving him another chance

WHEELER
Of course we did When youve
groomed someone they way we groomed
Andy nurturing him lavishing all
kinds of special treatment on him
youve made quite an investment
We were waiting for his promise to
kick in and deliver But
ultimately we could no longer
ignore the gap between the promise
and the reality This is one of
the saddest times in my life To
sit in this court testifying to
Andys ultimate failure to make
the grade To discover that he is
one of those people who wants to
benefit by the system but doesnt
want to play by the systems
rules To think you know someone
only to find out you dont know
them at all Its heartbreaking

BELINDA
Thank you Thats all for now
Your Honor

JUDGE GARNETT
Mr Miller

Joe rises Adjusts his jacket Wheeler waits

JOE

(very gentle)
Explain to me if you can Mr
Wheeler explain this to me like
Im a ten year-old This trial is
not about a disease is that what
youre saying Not about your
understandable if unfounded fear
of catching AIDS through casual
contact with someone who has it
Youre saying this trial is about
Andrew Becketts character Am I
getting this right
WHEELER
Yes character To the extent that it
affects a persons ability to do
a great job

Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat breathing
difficult He takes in the rest of the court while
Wheelers words THROB THROUGH THE AIR

WHEELER (CONT)
Andy worked when he wanted to work
telling us what he thought we
needed to know about his
lifestyle

ANDREWS POV -- ON RACHEL sitting among the spectators Rachel
begins speaking her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheelers (we should get
the feeling shes giving her testimony)

RACHEL
I didnt mind covering for Andy
but I did wonder when was he

planning to deal with his problem
Andrew blinks whats going on
Looking back to the court Joe presses in on Wheeler
Everything seems normal

WHEELER
Sometimes it seems like society
is run by these kinds of people

JOE
What kind of people

WHEELER
People who want to bend the rules

ANDREWS POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table

KILLCOYNE
If you want to be a leader in this
society you have to make
certain sacrifices

Wheeler keeps speaking
WHEELER

to suit their personal desires
and the rest of us have to live
with it
ANDREWS POV -- WALTER KENTON
KENTON

You have to make a decision is
this guy partner material

JOE
Who makes the rules Mr Wheeler
You
ANDREWS POV -- BOB SEIDMAN
SEIDMAN

Yes I did see the lesions I
suspected he was sick

CLOSE ON ANDREW closing his eyes
THE VOICES GET LOUDER FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER

WHEELER
The everyday common person with
decent values

RACHEL
It seems like he wasnt willing to
face the reality of his situation

Andrew slowly rises the VOICES GETTING LOUDER

SEIDMAN
I didnt tell the others I
was afraid to

WHEELER
But now were standing up for
ourselves

SEIDMAN
But we shouldnt have fired
him

WHEELER
Its time to get this society
back on track

The Judge the Jury -- everyone silent looking concerned
