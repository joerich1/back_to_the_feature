FADE IN
EXT PHOENIX ARIZONA - (DAY) - HELICOPTER SHOT

Above Midtown section of the city It is early afternoon a
hot mid-summer day The city is sun-sunblanched white and
its drifted-up noises are muted in blanched their own echoes
We fly low heading in a downtown direction passing over
traffic-clogged streets parking lots white business
buildings neatly patterned residential districts As we
approach downtown section the character of the city begins
to change It is darker and shabby with age and industry We
see railroad tracks smokestacks wholesale fruit-and-
vegetable markets old municipal buildings empty lots
vegetable The very geography seems to give us a climate of
nefariousness of back-doorness dark and shadowy And secret

We fly lower and faster now as if seeking out a specific
location A skinny high old hotel comes into view On its
exposed brick side great painted letters advertise Transients-—
Low Weekly Rates-Radio in Every Room We pause long enough

to establish the shoddy character of this hotel Its open
curtainless windows its silent resigned look so
characteristic of such hole-and-corner hotels We move forward
with purposefulness and-toward a certain window The sash is
raised as high as it can go but the shade is pulled down to
three or four inches of the inside sill as if the occupants
of the room within wanted privacy but needed air We are

close now so that only the lower half of the window frame

is in shot No sounds come from within the room

Suddenly we tip downward go to the narrow space between
shade and sill peep into the room

A young woman is stretched out on the mussed bed She wears
a full slip stockings no shoes She lies in and attitude
of physical relaxation but her face seen in the dimness of
the room betrays a certain inner-tension worrisome
conflicts She is MARY CRANE an tension attractive girl
nearing the end of her twenties and her rope

A man stands beside the bed only the lower half of his figure
visible We hold on this tableau for a long moment then
start forward As we pass under the window shade
CUT TO
INT THE HOTEL ROOM - (DAY)

A small room a slow fan buzzing on a shelf above the narrow
bed A card of hotel rules is pasted on the mirror above the
bureau An unopened suitcase and a womans large straw open-
top handbag are on the bureau

On the table beside the bed there are a container of Coco-
Cola and an unwrapped untouched egg-salad sandwich There
is no radio

The man standing by the bed wearing only trousers T-shirt
and sox is SAM LOOMIS a good-looking sensual shirt man

with warm humorous eyes and a compelling smile He is blotting
his neck and face with a thin towel and is staring down at
Mary a small sweet smile playing about his mouth Mary keeps
her face turned away from him

After a moment Sam drops the towel sits on the bed leans
over and takes Mary into his arms kisses her long and warmly
holds her with a firm possessiveness The kiss is disturbed
and finally interrupted by the buzzing closeness of an
inconsiderate fly Sam smiles pulls away enough to allow
Mary to relax again against the pillow He studies her frowns
at her unresponsiveness then speaks in a low intimate
playful voice

SAM
Never did eat your lunch did you

Mary looks at his smile has to respond pulls him to her
kisses him Then and without breaking the kiss she swings
her legs over the side of the bed toe-searches around finds
her shoes slips her feet into searches them And finally
pulls away and sits up

MARY
I better get back to the office
These extended lunch hours give my
boss excess acid

She rises goes to the bureau takes a pair of small earrings
out of her bag begins putting them on not bothering or
perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror Sam
watches her concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery
humorous good mood Throughout remainder of this scene they
occupy themselves with dressing hair-combing etc

SAM
Call your boss and tell him youre
taking the rest of the afternoon
off Its Friday anyway and hot

MARY
(soft sarcasm)
What do I do with my free afternoon
walk you to the airport

SAM
(meaningfully)
We could laze around here a while
longer

MARY

Checking out time is three PM Hotels
of this sort arent interested in
you when you come in but when your
times up

(a small anguish)
Sam I hate having to be with you in
a place like this

SAM
Ive heard of married couples who
deliberately spend occasional nights
in cheap hotels They say it

MARY
(interrupting)
When youre married you can do a lot
of things deliberately

SAM
You sure talk like a girl whos been
married

MARY
Sam

SAM
Im sorry Mary
(after a moment)
My old Dad used to say ‘when you
cant change a situation laugh at
it Nothing ridicules a thing like
laughing at it

MARY
Ive lost my girlish laughter

SAM
(observing)
The only girlish thing you have lost

MARY
(a meaningful quiet
then with difficulty)
Sam This is the last time

SAM
For what
He breaks off

MARY

This Meeting you in secret so we

can be secretive You come down
here on business trips and we steal
lunch hours and I wish you wouldnt

even come

SAM

Okay What do we do instead write
each other lurid love letters

MARY

(about to argue then
turning away)
I havent time to argue Im a working

girl

SAM

And Im a working man Were a regular
working-class tragedy
(he laughs)

It is tragic

MARY

Or it will be if we

go on meeting in shabby hotels
whenever you can find a tax-deductible
excuse for flying down deductible

here

SAM

(interrupting
seriously)
You cant laugh at it huh

Can you

MARY

SAM

Sure Its like laughing through a

broken jaw

but

his cheeriness dissolved goes to the window

tries to raise the shade It sticks He pulls at it

It comes down entirely

and the hot sun glares into the room

revealing it in all its shabbiness and sordidness as if
corroborating Marys words and attitude Sam kicks at the

fallen shade

again

And besides

laughs in frustration grabs on to his humor

SAM

when you say I make tax-

deductible excuses you make me out a

criminal

MARY

(having to smile)
You couldnt be a criminal if you
committed a major crime

SAM
I wish I were Not an active criminal
but a nice guy with the conscience

of a criminal
(goes close to mary
touches her)
Next best thing to no conscience at
all

MARY
(pulling away)
I have to go Sam

SAM
I can come down next week

MARY
No

SAM
Not even just to see you to have
lunch in public

MARY
We can see each other we can even
have dinner but respectably in

my house with my mothers picture on
the mantel and my sister helping me
broil a big steak for three

SAM
And after the steak do we send
Sister to the movies and turn Mamas
picture to the wall

MARY
Sam No
SAM
(after a pause simply)
All right

She stares at him surprised at his willingness to continue
the affair on her terms as girls are so often surprised
when they discover men will continue to want them even after
the sexual bait has been pulled in Sam smiles reassuringly
places his hands gently on her arms speaks with gentle and
simple sincerity

SAM
Mary whenever its possible tax-
deductible or not I want to see
deductible you And under any
conditions
(a smile)
Even respectability

MARY
You make respectability sound
disrespectful

SAM

(brightly)
Im all for it It requires patience
and temperance and a lot of sweating-
out otherwise though its only
hard work

(a pause)
But if I can see you touch you even
as simply as this I wont mind

He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems
crushes away his good humor There is a quiet moment

SAM
Im fed up with sweating for people
who arent there I sweat to pay off
my fathers debts and hes in his
grave I sweat to pay my ex-wife
alimony and shes living on the
other side of the world somewhere

MARY
(a smile)
I pay too They also pay who meet
in hotel rooms

SAM
A couple of years and the debts will
be paid off And if she ever re-

marries the alimony stops and
then
MARY
I havent even been married once
yet
SAM
Yeah but when you do youll swing
MARY

(smiling then with a
terrible urgency)
Sam lets go get married

SAM
And live with me in a storeroom behind
a hardware store in Fairvale Well
have a lot of laughs When I send my
ex-wife her money you can lick the
stamps
MARY
(a deep desperation)
Ill lick the stamps

He looks at her long pulls her close kisses her lightly
looks out the window and stares at the wide sky

SAM

You know what Id like A clear
empty sky and a plane and us in
it and somewhere a private island
for sale where we can run around
without our shoes on And the
wherewithal to buy what Id like

(he moves away

suddenly serious)
Mary you want to cut this off go
out and find yourself someone
available

MARY
Im thinking of it

SAM
(a cheerful shout)
How can you even think a thing like
that

MARY
(picking up handbag
starting for door)
Dont miss your plane

SAM
Hey we can leave together cant we

MARY
(at door)
Im late and you have to put your
shoes on

Mary goes out quickly closing door behind her As Sam stares
down at his shoeless feet

MR LOWERY and his oil-lease client TOM CASSIDY enter the
office Lowery is a pleasant worried-faced man big and a
trifle pompous Cassidy is very faced loud and has a lunch-
hour load on He is a gross man exuding a kind of pitiful
vulgarity

CASSIDY

Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary tries to lead
Cassidy toward the private office

LOWERY

remark continues sorting out the deed copies tries to ignore
the mans hot-breath closeness

to come and pull him bodily into the office When the men
are gone and the door is closed Caroline picks up a bundle

DISSOLVE
INT MARYS BEDROOM - (DAY)
A double bed in the foreground We just see the far side as
the CAMERA SHOOTS across Mary enters the scene clad only

in her slip Perhaps she is about to get into bed Behind
her is an open closet but too dark inside for us to see any
contents As Mary turns to the closet the CAMERA LOWERS to
show a close view of the 40000 in the envelope on our side
of the bed

Mary takes a dress from the closet and starts to put it on
as the CAMERA RETREATS to reveal a packed but not yet closed
suitcase also on the bed Mary zips up her dress and then
brings some final garments from the closet

She comes around to the suitcase and puts them on the top
Mary works with haste and in tension as if acting on an
impulse which might vanish as quickly as it came

The suitcase filled now she checks around the room then
takes her handbag to the bed puts in the money-filled
envelope and then slams the suitcase shut Then filled she
looks at her small bedroom desk goes to it removes a small
file-envelope from one of the drawers It is one of those
brown envelopes in which one keeps important papers and
policies and certificates She checks its contents briefly
puts it on the bed opens another desk drawer takes out her
bank book tosses it on the bed Then she packs both the
file-envelope and the bank book into her handbag takes one
quick last look around the room picks up the handbag and
the suitcase and goes out of the room

CUT TO

EXT MARYS GARAGE - (DAY)
A two-car garage One car is gone Marys car is parked in
the driveway The CAMERA is low enough so that we can easily
read the Arizona number plate in the foreground
Mary comes out of house starts for the trunk intending to
put the suitcase in changes her mind places the suitcase
and her handbag on the front seat gets in starts the car
begins to back out of driveway

DISSOLVE TO
EXT MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)
We are close on Marys car shooting in at her troubled
guilty face She seems to be driving with that excess care
of one who does not wish to be stopped for a minor traffic
irregularity She stops for a red light at a main
intersection

FROM MARYS VIEWPOINT - (DAY)

We see Lowery and Cassidy crossing the street passing right
in front of Marys car

MARYS CAR - (DAY)

Mary freezes
EXT MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

Cassidy glancing into car sees Mary lets out a cheery
exclamation elbows Lowery Lowery turns sees Mary smiles
pleasantly pulls Cassidy on

MARYS CAR - (DAY)

Mary watches the entire exchange with a look of stony horror
on her face

EXT MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

Now we look closely at Lowery As he reaches the curb a
small confusion brightens his face He remembers that Mary
intended to spend the weekend in bed He considers
curiously turns looks back at her a slight frown on his
face

MARYS CAR - (DAY)

Mary sees the pause and the look

EXT MAIN STREET IN MIDTOWN PHOENIX - (DAY)

For a moment it even looks as if Lowery might be meaning to
cross back to the car

MARYS CAR - (DAY)

Marys tension is unbearable And at that moment we hear the
shrill shriek of the traffic cops whistle

Mary zooms the car away

DISSOLVE TO
EXT HIGHWAY - (DAY)
Mary in car driving safely away from town Her look is
less tense now and more purposeful After a moment she
checks the fuel gauge frowns looks along highway for a gas

station

FAST DISSOLVE

MARY - (DAY)

Looks at gas gauge

CU GAS GAUGE - (DAY)
EXT A GAS STATION - (DAY)

We see Marys car drive in come to a stop There are no
other cars about this being a gas station off the main
highway and the attendant is obviously in the shack Mary
looks worried about having to make this stop keeps her face
turned away from the shack not wishing it to be seen

No one comes and for a moment Mary considers driving on as
if the emptiness of the station were a warning an omen that
she should listen to But the gas registers almost empty
She has to blow her horn

A YOUNG MAN comes out of the shack starts toward her car

At that moment we HEAR the RINGING of the TELEPHONE in the
shack The Attendant walks a few steps further toward Marys
car then decides to go back and answer the phone The phones
insistent ringing unnerves Mary

a

e starts her car zooms off

We see the Attendant phone in hand in the doorway of shack
He looks after the departing car with little or no expression

CAR

The car grows smaller as it races up the road The sun is
setting There is something vaguely ominous about the
darkening sky into which the car seems to be disappearing

DISSOLVE TO
MARY IN CAR - (NIGHT)

The oncoming headlights hurt Marys eyes She is getting
sleepy and her vision is blurring Her eyes close
involuntarily snap open again She stretches than wide as
if forcing them to stay open The oncoming lights seem to
glare to a point beyond endurance She murmurs Sam - Sam

LONG LAP
DISSOLVE

EXT ROAD SHOULDER - (DAWN)

We see Marys car dim in the early dawn tilted on the soft
shoulder of the road looking somehow sad and pathetic like

a childs thrown-away toy And from this angle it would appear
that the car is empty

After a moment during which there are no other vehicles
passing we see coming from the far distance a HIGHWAY
PATROLMAN in a patrol car He passes Marys car notes its
apparent emptiness U-turns comes back up behind the car
He gets out and approaches the drivers side window
EXT MARYS CAR - (DAWN)
The Patrolman looks down into the car
INT CAR (DAWN) FROM HIS VIEWPOINT

Mary turns with a start sits up is startled and unnerved
by the sight of the Patrolman and as if by automatic reflex
turns the ignition and presses down on the starter

EXT CAR (DAWN)
The Patrolman holds up his hand

PATROLMAN
(startled)
Hold it there

Mary slams down on the brake tries to pull herself together
The Patrolman raps again less gently

Reluctantly Mary rolls down the window The Patrolman studies
her for a moment

PATROLMAN
In quite a hurry

MARY

Yes

(because he seems to

be awaiting an

explanation)
I didnt mean to sleep so long I
was afraid Id have an accident last
night from sleepiness so I decided
to pull over

PATROLMAN
You slept here all night

MARY
(a faint edge of
defensiveness)
Yes As I said I couldnt keep my
eyes

area You should have I mean

answer)

Mary seems about to object thinks better of it turns off
the ignition

PATROLMAN

In the course of my duty I never
take up anyones time whether

(a little softer)
Now if you woke up on the wrong side
of the car seat thats one thing
But when you act as if Ive just
placed you under arrest

MARY
Im sorry

PATROLMAN
No need to apologize
Mary starts the car her face turned as if she wishes the
matter were all settled and the Patrolman had already gone
The Patrolman isnt exactly one of those civil servants who
demands a thank-you but he does feel her manner is a bit
too abrupt He calls

PATROLMAN
Wait a minute
MARY
(jamming down the

brake)
Now what

The Patrolman gazes at her a moment then

PATROLMAN
May I see your license

MARY
Why

PATROLMAN

to act normally under the pressure of guilt As she drives

of the car glances toward the lot office turns her attention
to the line of cars notice the California licence plates on
all of them The CAR DEALER calls out from his office

CAR DEALER

Mary nods starts walking along the line of cars as if making
a selection Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand
on the corner just outside the lot
She stares at the papers turns away as if what she is
fearing would have to be impossible then having to satisfy
herself goes to the stand drops a dime in the iron slot
picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper starts back into the car

we see coming up the street toward the lot the same
PATROLMAN He sees Mary slows swerves over to the opposite

the newspaper and walking back ease the lot does not see
the Patrolman

The car dealer is out on the lot now standing and waiting

CAR DEALER

her car)
But like I said too nice a day for
arguing Ill just shoot this into
the garage

He starts into Marys car She looks at him in near panic
wanting to skip the whole thing Torn wondering if the
presence of the Patrolman doesnt negate the value of changing
cars wondering how she can get away wondering if shell be
followed or if the Patrolman will go away if she does stay
here

All these panic-fears rush her mind and she can do nothing
The Car Dealer has driven her car into the garage She stands
in the middle of the lot feeling like a shooting target

She looks toward the garage

ownership papers and
the new bills)

CAR DEALER

He starts toward the office building Mary follows closely
anxiously She glances sees

THE PATROLMAN - MARYS POV - (DAY)

He is still at the far curb

EXT USED CAR LOT - (DAY)

The Car Dealer goes into his office Mary follows
THE PATROLMAN - (DAY)

A second later he starts his automobile checks traffic
comes across the street slowly and drives onto the lot He
pauses a moment then drives across the lot passing the
office going on to the other exit stops there as Marys
car is driven back onto the lot

The MECHANIC stops Marys car hops out waves to the
Patrolman The Patrolman waves back goes on a bit until he
is behind Marys car stops again looks over at the office
In a moment Mary comes out hurries across to her new car
gets in starts the motor The Mechanic yells

MECHANIC

Mary pauses turns sees the Patrolman then the Mechanic
Her face goes white She doesnt know which man called her
Then the Mechanic waves starts forward with her suitcase

MARY
(as Mechanic reaches
car)
Just put it right in here please
beside me

The Mechanic smiles throws the suitcase in Mary zooms off
As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic the Car Dealer
and the Patrolman all looking after her

DISSOLVE TO

MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

Mary is driving tensely She checks the rear-view mirror is
more shocked than pleased when she sees

MARYS REAR-VIEW MIRROR

No sign of the Patrolman

MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

She turns her face looks out at the highway
ROUTE 99 - MARYS POV

It is heavy with traffic

MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

Again she checks the mirror and although
MARYS REAR-VIEW MIRROR

There is still no sign of the Patrolman
MARY IN NEW CAR ON ROUTE

She cannot relax or feel safe cannot convince herself that
nothing will come of the mans watching and suspicions

CAMERA IS CLOSE on Marys face now recording her anxiety
her fears Her guilt shines bright in her eyes and she is a
person unaccustomed to containing this much guilt in this
realistic a situation Suddenly we hear the SOUND of the
Used Car Dealers laugh hear it as clearly as Mary hears it
in her imagination The imagined voice we hear is actually
the voice of the Car Dealer

CAR DEALERS VOICE
Heck Officer that was the first
time I ever saw the Customer high-
pressure the Salesman Somebody
chasing her

PATROLMANS VOICE
I better have a look at those papers
Charlie

CAR DEALERS VOICE
She look like a wrong-one to you

PATROLMANS VOICE
Acted like one
Mary blinks shakes her head as if trying to shake away
these voices of her imagination She checks the rear-view
mirror
MARYS REAR-VIEW MIRROR
Still no sight of the Patrolman

MARY IN NEW CAR

She tries to force herself to relax almost succeeds when
she is sprung to tension again by

EXT HIGHWAY
The sight of a police car As she drives past we hear the
squeaky unintelligible voice coming over the car radio
Mary zooms down on the gas whizzes ahead

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
EXT HIGHWAY 99 - LONG SHOT
Marys car dashing along

DISSOLVE TO

MARY IN NEW CAR

Mary looks weary tired with strain and with hard driving
Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought

OUT THE WINDSHIELD
We can see that it is much later in the day almost dusk
MARY IN NEW CAR

We HEAR the sound of an agitated BUZZ of an intercom system
a sound emanating from Marys imagination

After the second BUZZ we HEAR the voice of Caroline

CAROLINES VOICE
Yes Mr Lowery

LOWERYS VOICE
(a worried tone)
Caroline Mary still isnt in

CAROLINES VOICE
No Mr Lowery but then shes
always a bit late on Monday mornings

LOWERYS VOICE
Buzz me the minute she comes in

Again Mary shakes her head forces herself to stop hearing
these invented scenes of her imagination

EXT HIGHWAY

Now we cut to the view of the road from Marys viewpoint
Darkness of evening is coming In the dim twilight we see
the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations
beginning to blaze on

INT MARYS NEW CAR

Back on Marys face and after a moment the imagined voices
again

LOWERYS VOICE
Call her sister If no ones answering
at the house

CAROLINES VOICE
I called her sister Mr Lowery
where she works the Music Makers
Music Store you know And she doesnt
know where Mary is any more than we
do

LOWERYS VOICE
You better run out to the house
She may be unable to answer the
phone

CAROLINES VOICE
Her sisters going to do that Shes
as worried as we are

A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Marys face
She closes her eyes for one tight swift moment

EXT HIGHWAY

We cut again to the highway The first oncoming headlights
slash at the windshield

INT MARYS NEW CAR

Cutting back to Mary we can sense by the tense muscles of
her face that she is driving faster The oncoming headlights
blurt at her

Suddenly we HEAR Lowerys voice loud now and frightened as
if the anxiety in the mans voice was strong enough to break
through Marys effort to keep her mind silent and her
imagination blank

LOWERYS VOICE
No I havent the faintest idea As
I said I last saw your sister when
she left this office on Friday
she said she didnt feel well and
wanted to leave early and I said she
could And that was the last I saw

(a pause a thought)
wait a minute I did see her an
hour or so later driving

(a pause then with

solemn fear)
Ah I think youd better come over
here to my office Quick

(a pause a click)
Caroline get Mr Cassidy for me

EXT HIGHWAY

It is completely dark now night
INT MARYS NEW CAR

We cut back to her face

LOWERYS VOICE
After all Cassidy I told you
all that cash Im not taking the
responsibility Oh for heavens
sake a girl works for you for ten
years you trust her All right
yes you better come over

FROM MARYS VIEWPOINT
EXT THE ROAD AHEAD INT MARYS NEW CAR

Fast cut back to Marys face Oncoming headlights throw a
blinding light across her features

CASSIDYS VOICE

(undrunk sharp with

rage)
Well I aint about to kiss off forty
thousand dollars Ill get it back
and if any of its missin Ill
replace it with her fine soft flesh
Ill track her never you doubt it

LOWERYS VOICE

Hold on Cassidy I still cant
believe it must be some kind of a
mystery I cant

CASSIDYS VOICE
You checked with the bank no They
never laid eyes on her no You
still trustin Hot creepers she
sat there while I dumped it out
hardly even looked at it plannin
and and even flirtin with me
A look of revulsion makes Mary close her eyes
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD AGAIN
Big drops of rain begin to appear
CLOSEUP - MARY
She is becoming aware of the rain starting
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights
CLOSEUP - MARY
Mary starts the windshield wipers
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain
CLOSEUP - MARY
Peering through the blurred windshield
CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS
slowing down in the flooding highway
CLOSEUP - MARY
peering through the windshield The oncoming lights are fewer
CLOSEUP - THE CAR WHEELS
almost coming to a slow turn
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
just blackness and rain
CLOSEUP - MARY
peering
MARYS VIEWPOINT

An almost undiscernible light in the far distance a neon
sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield

MARYS CAR
She presses down forces the car to move on through the
flooded road

EXT THE ROAD

As we move closer we see the neon sign more clearly and can
faintly make out the large letters which read Motel Mary
stops the car lowers the window slightly looks out We see
the sign clearly now BATES MOTEL Mary opens the car door
and dashes out into the rain and up onto the porch of the
motel office

EXT BATES MOTEL - (NIGHT)

Mary pauses on the porch The lights are on within the office
She tries door finds it open goes into office CAMERA
FOLLOWS her into office There is no one present Mary goes
to the desk rings a small pushbell There is no response
Mary rubs her forehead in weariness and frustration goes
back out onto the porch She looks off in another direction
slightly behind the office and sees

MARYS VIEWPOINT - A LARGE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)

A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house
There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms A WOMAN
passes the window pauses peers out

We see her in clear silhouette She quickly goes away from
the window

EXT PORCH OF BATES MOTEL - (NIGHT)

Mary having seen the woman expects now that she will get
some attention She stands a few moments waiting

No one comes Impatience and anger rise in Mary She dashes
out into the rain to her car gets in opens the side window
begins to honk the horn After a moment a YOUNG MAN open
the front door of the house pauses starts down the path
After a few steps he turns and runs back into the house
Mary leaves her car starts a dash for the shelter of the
porch As she runs we see that the Young Man has gone back
only to get an umbrella Seeing that Mary is on her way to
the porch he runs quickly the umbrella unopened in his
hand He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached
it

He stops short looks at her then at the umbrella hanging
useless in his hand then back to her

There is something sadly touching in his manner in his look
Marys impatience goes and she smiles and this makes him
almost smile He gestures her into the office standing back
to indicate that he will go after her She goes into the
office
INT OFFICE OF BATES MOTEL - (NIGHT)

The Young Man follows Mary in closes the door He is NORMAN
BATES somewhere in his late twenties thin and tall soft-
spoken and hesitant

NORMAN
Dirty night

MARY
(not really a question)
You have a vacancy

NORMAN
(simply almost
cheerfully)
We have twelve vacancies Twelve
cabins twelve vacancies
(a pause)
They moved away the highway

MARY
I thought Id gotten off the main

NORMAN
I knew you must have No one stops
here anymore unless they do

He is behind the counter now pushing forward the registration
book

NORMAN
But its no good dwelling on our
losses is it We go right ahead
lighting signs and following the
formalities Would you sign

Mary has placed her handbag on the counter She takes the
registration book picks up the pen is suddenly struck with
the realization that shed better use an alias She writes
the name Marie Samuels

NORMAN
Your home address Oh just the town
will do

MARY

(glancing at newspaper
sticking out of her
handbag)

Los Angeles

She realizes he didnt ask her to tell him merely to write
it down She smiles writes Los Angeles beside the false
name Norman smiles stops smiling out of embarrassment
NORMAN
Cabin One Its closer in case you
want anything right next to the
office

CLOSEUP - NORMAN

He removes a key for Cabin One We see that there is a
remaining key on the board

TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN

MARY
I want sleep more than anything
Except maybe food

NORMAN
Theres a big diner about ten miles
on up just outside Fairvale
MARY

Am I that close to Fairvale

NORMAN
Fifteen miles Ill get your bags

He goes to door opens it The rain has slowed down
considerably He smiles at this fact as if to communicate
some pleasure he finds in it Mary follows him to the door
goes out on the porch waits and watches as Norman runs to
her car gets in drives it to the parking space in front of
Cabin One Mary walks along the porch waits before the door
of Cabin One

Norman gets out of car with suitcase runs to the door
opens it pushes the door open puts his hand in and switches
on a light Mary goes into the cabin Norman follows her

INT CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)

Norman places suitcase on bed goes to the window opens it

NORMAN

bathroom fairly

blushes)

MARY

NORMAN
(quickly starting to

leave)

NORMAN

He pauses at the door gazes at her She smiles

MARY

Thank you Again

NORMAN
(not really a question)

MARY

NORMAN

Then will you do me a favor

(without waiting for

her response)
Will you have supper here I was
just about to myself nothing
more than some sandwiches and a lot
of milk but Id like it if youd
come up to the house and I dont
set a fancy table but the kitchens
awful homey

MARY
Id like to

NORMAN
All right you get your dresses
hanging out and change those wet
shoes and Ill come for you soon as
its ready
(starts out)
with my trusty umbrella
(he laughs a small
laugh runs off)

Mary closes the door goes to suitcase opens it starts to
take out a dress Her handbag is next to the suitcase She
glances down into it pauses drops the dress reaches into
the handbag takes out the money-filled envelope stares at
it almost with regret filled contemplates hiding it decides
to starts looking for a reasonable hiding place She looks
about at the closet the drawers etc realizes all such
places are obvious Catching sight of the newspaper in her
bag she hits on a solution She opens the newspaper places
the envelope within it lock-folds the paper again and then
places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later
reading She considers this for a moment accepts it goes

to her suitcase to start unpacking

Suddenly the quiet is shattered by the shrill ugly sound of
a womans voice raised in anger

WOMANS VOICE
No I tell you no

Mary walks slowly to the window realizing that the terrible
voice is coming from the house behind the cabins CAMERA
FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is
still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming
from that room The rain has stopped and the moon is out

WOMANS VOICE

I wont have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper

(an ugly sneering

note creeps into the

voice)
-by candlelight I suppose in the
cheap erotic fashion of young men
with cheap erotic minds

NORMANS VOICE
Mother please

WOMANS VOICE
And then what After supper music
Whispers

NORMANS VOICE
Mother shes just a stranger
hungry and the weathers bad

WOMANS VOICE
(mimicking cruelly)
Mother shes just a stranger
(hard cruel again)
As if men dont desire strangers as
if oh I refuse to speak of
disgusting things because they disgust
me You understand Boy

WOMANS VOICE

(pause)
Go on go tell her shell not be
appeasing her ugly appetite with my
food or my son Or do I have to
tell her cause you dont have the
guts Huh boy You have the guts
boy

NORMANS VOICE
(blurted cut fury and
shame)
Shut up Shut up

There is the SOUND of a door closing in that room up there
Mary has stood by the window listening with mounting distress
and concern and sympathy She turns her face away now gazes
sadly at the little empty room

In a moment there is the SOUND of the houses front door
slamming shut Mary turns looks out the window

FROM MARYS VIEWPOINT - (NIGHT)

We see Norman coming down the path carrying a napkin-covered
tray

INT CABIN ONE - (NIGHT)

Mary looks at him for a moment then turns quickly goes to
the door opens it and goes out onto the porch

EXT THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

Mary pauses outside the door is about to start forward when
Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch
past the office stopping only when he is close to her He
stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her
eye

MARY
Ive caused you some trouble

NORMAN
Mother
(a hollow little laugh
an attempt at sardonic
humor)
what is the phrase she isnt
herself today I think thats it

MARY
(looking at the tray)
You shouldnt have bothered I really
dont have that much of an appetite

Norman flinches realizing she has heard his mothers
reference to Marys appetite

NORMAN
Im sorry I wish people could
apologize for other people

MARY
Dont worry about it
(a warm smile)
But as long as youve made us supper
we may as well eat it Huh

She begins to back into her room Norman starts to follow
hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young
woman and a motel room Bringing down the tray of food in
defiance of his mothers orders is about the limit of his
defiance for one day He cannot go into Marys room

NORMAN
It might be nicer warmer in the
office

Without waiting for approval or disapproval he turns hurries
to the office Mary looks after him her face showing amused
sympathy then follows

INT THE MOTEL OFFICE - (NIGHT)

Norman looks about tray in hand sees there is no reasonable
place to spread out a supper He turns sees Mary standing
in the doorway

NORMAN
Eating in an office
(a rueful smile)
to officious even for me I have
the parlor behind this if youd
like

Mary nods Norman walks on behind the counter and into the
darkened parlor Mary follows

INT NORMANS PARLOR - (NIGHT)

In the darkened room lit only by the light from the office
spilling in we see Norman placing the tray on a table Mary
comes to the doorway pauses Norman straightens up goes to
lamp turns on the light

Mary is startled by the room Even in the dimness of one
lamp the strange extraordinary nature of the room rushes
up at one It is a room of birds Stuffed birds all over
the room on every available surface one even clinging to
the old fashioned fringed shade of the lamp The birds are
of many varieties beautiful grand horrible preying Mary
stares in awe and a certain fascinated horror

CLOSE UP - THE VARIOUS BIRDS TWO SHOT - MARY AND NORMAN

NORMAN
Please sit down On the sofa

As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and
pouring the milk we follow Mary across the room She studies
the birds as she walks briefly examines a bookcase stacked
with books on the subject of Taxidermy

CLOSE UP - THE BOOKS ON TAXIDERMY MED CLOSE SHOT - MARY

She notices too the paintings on the wall nudes primarily
and many with a vaguely religious overtone

Finally Mary reaches the sofa sits down looks at the spread

MARY
Youre very kind

NORMAN
Its all for you Im not hungry
Please go ahead

Mary begins to eat her attitude a bit tense She takes up a
small slice of ham bites off a tiny bite nibbles at it in
the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied

Norman gazes at her at the tiny bite she has taken smiles
and then laughs

NORMAN
You eat like a bird

MARY
Youd know of course

NORMAN
Not really I hear that expression
that one eats like a bird is really
a falsie I mean a falsity because
birds eat a tremendous lot
(A pause then
explaining)
Oh I dont know anything about birds
My hobby is stuffing things
taxidermy And I guess Id just rather
stuff birds because well I hate
the look of beasts when theyre
stuffed foxes and chimps and all
some people even stuff dogs and
cats but I cant I think only

birds look well stuffed because
theyre rather passive to begin
with most of them

He trails off his exuberance failing in the rushing return
of his natural hesitancy and discomfort Mary looks at him
with some compression smiles

MARY
Its a strange hobby Curious I
mean
NORMAN
Uncommon too
MARY
I imagine so
NORMAN

Its not as expensive as youd think
Cheap really Needles thread
sawdust the chemicals are all
that cost anything
(He goes quiet looks
disturbed)

MARY
A man should have a hobby

NORMAN
Its more than a hobby sometimes
a hobby is supposed to pass the time
not fill it

MARY
(after a pause softly)
Is your time so empty

NORMAN

Oh no

(forcing brightness

again)
I run the office tend the cabins
and grounds do little chores for
mother the ones she allows I might
be capable of doing

MARY
You go out with friends

NORMAN
Friends Who needs friends
(Laughs then with
gallows humor)
A boys best friend is his mother
(Stops laughing)
Youve never had an empty moment in
your whole life Have you

MARY
Only my share

NORMAN
Where are you going I dont mean to
pry

MARY
(A wistful smile)
Im looking for a private island

NORMAN
What are you running away from

MARY
(Alert)
Why do you ask that

NORMAN
No People never run away from
anything
(A pause)

The rain didnt last very long
(Turning suddenly)
You know what I think I think were
all in our private traps clamped in
them and none of us can ever climb
out We scratch and claw but only
at the air only at each other and
for all of it we never budge an
inch

MARY
Sometimes we deliberately step into
those traps

NORMAN
I was born in mine I dont mind it
anymore

MARY
You should mind it

NORMAN
Oh I do but I say I dont
(Laughs boyishly)

MARY
(Staring at him
shaking her head

softly)
If anyone ever spoke to me the way
I heard The way she spoke to you

I dont think I could ever laugh
again
NORMAN

(Controlled resentment)
Sometimes when she talks that way to
me Id like to curse her out and
leave her forever

(A rueful smile)
Or at least defy her

(A pause a hopeless

shrug)
But I couldnt Shes ill

MARY
She sounded strong

NORMAN

I mean ill

(A pause)
She had to raise me all by herself
after my dad died I was only
five and it must have been a
strain Oh she didnt have to go
out to work or anything Dad left us
with a little something anyway a
few years ago Mother met a man
He talked her into building this
motel We could have talked her
into anything and when Well
It was just too much for her when he
died too And the way he died
Oh its nothing to talk about when
youre eating

(Pauses smiles)
Anyway it was too much of a loss

for my mother she had nothing
left
MARY
(Critically)

Except you

NORMAN
A son is a poor substitute for a
lover
(Turns away as if in
distaste of the word)

MARY
Why dont you go away

NORMAN
To a private island like you

MARY
No not like me

NORMAN
Its too late for me And besides
whod look after her Shed be alone
up there the fire would go out
damp and cold like a grave When
you love someone you dont do that
to them even if you hate them Oh
I dont hate her I hate what
shes become I hate the illness

MARY
(Slowly carefully)
Wouldnt it be better if you put her
in someplace

She hesitates Norman turns slowly looking at her with a
striking coldness

NORMAN
An Institution A madhouse People
always call a madhouse someplace
(Mimicing coldly)
Put her in Someplace

MARY
Im sorry I didnt mean it to
sound uncaring

NORMAN

(The coldness turning

to tight fury)
What do you mean about caring Have
you ever seen one of those places
Inside Laughing and tears and cruel
eyes studying you and my mother
there Why has she harmed you
Shes as harmless as one of these
stuffed birds

MARY
am sorry I only felt it seemed
e was harming you I meant

H

id)

NORMAN
(High fury now)
Well You meant well People always
mean well they cluck their thick
tongues and shake their heads and
suggest so very delicately that

The fury suddenly dies abruptly and completely and he sinks
back into his chair There is a brief silence

Mary watches the troubled man is almost physically pained
by his anguish

NORMAN
(Quietly)
Ive suggested it myself But I hate
to even think such a thing She
needs me and it isnt

(Looks up with a

childlike pleading

in his eyes)
it isnt as if she were a maniac
a raving thing its just that
sometimes she goes a little mad We
all go a little mad sometimes Havent
you

MARY
(After a long
thoughtful pause)
Yes and just one time can be enough
(Rises)
Thank you

NORMAN
(Cheerfully correcting)
Thank you Norman

MARY
Norman

NORMAN
Youre not going to to your room
already

MARY

Im very tired And Ill have a long
drive tomorrow All the way back to
Phoenix

NORMAN
Phoenix

MARY
I stepped into a private trap back
there -- and I want to go back and

try to pull myself out
(Looking close at
Norman)
Before its too late for me too

NORMAN
(Looking at her)
Why dont you stay a little while
just for talking

MARY
Id like to but

NORMAN
Alright Ill see you in the morning
Ill bring you breakfast What time
will you

MARY
Very early Dawn

NORMAN
Alright Miss
(He has forgotten her
name)

MARY
Crane

NORMAN
Thats it

(He frowns as if
bothered by not being
able to match the
name to the memory

of the name in the
registration book)

MARY
Good night

She goes out of the parlor We see her from Normans
viewpoint as she crosses the small office goes out into
the night Norman turns and looks at the table and we see
his face now It is bright with that drunken-like look of
determination and encouragement and like resolve He starts
to clean up the table pauses as he hears the closing of
Marys door in the cabin next door

He holds still listens He goes into the office and looks
at the book

CU - THE NAME SAMUELS
MS - NORMAN

He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression

The sound of Mary moving about her room come over soft
SOUNDS somehow intimate in the night quiet Norman turns

his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS seems to be fighting
an impulse to listen or more than listen

But slowly he is forced to surrender to the impulse and
resisting himself he goes to the wall presses the side of
his head against it The SOUNDS come louder as if we too
had our ear pressed against the wall Now Norman looks at a
picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning
against Slowly he starts toward it

He reaches it touches it reluctantly lifts the small frame
off the wall

A tiny circle of light hits Normans face coming from the
hole in the wall behind the picture This end of the room is
very dim and thus we are able to see clearly the light
striking Normans face

We move close to Norman extremely close until his profile
fills the screen The tiny spot of light hits his eye See

the small hole through which the light comes Norman peeps
through

NORMANS VIEWPOINT

Through the hole we look into Marys cabin see Mary
undressing She is in her bra and halfslip She stoops over
a bit places her hands behind her upper back begins to
unhook her bra

NORMAN - ECU

He watches as Mary removes her bra We see his eye run up
and down the unseen figure of Mary

NORMANS VIEWPOINT
Mary just slipping into a robe covering her complete nudity
NORMAN

He turns from the hole faces us for a moment continues
turning until he can look out the small parlor window

We see as he sees
THE HOUSE IN THE BACKGROUND
NORMAN

He turns his face away quickly resentfully In his face we
see anger and anguish And then resolve

Quickly precisely he rehangs the picture over the hole in
the wall turns starts out of the parlor We see him go
through the office and out onto the porch not even bothering
to close the door behind him

CUT TO
EXT THE MOTEL OFFICE PORCH - (NIGHT)

Norman walking along the porch in the direction of the big
house Once on the path he pauses looks up at the light in
the bedroom window then pulls himself up squares his
shoulders strides manfully up the path

CAMERA follows behind him He opens the door of the house
enters We see him pause at the foot of the stairway look
up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair He
holds for a moment and then his resolve and courage
evaporates His shoulders slump sadly mournfully He by-
passes the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen
At the far end of the hall He enters the kitchen drops
wearily into a chair After a moment he stretches out a leg
and gently pushes the kitchen door closed

CUT TO
INT MARYS MOTEL ROOM - (NIGHT)

Mary is seated at the small desk engrossed in figuring ina
small notebook We see from these figures a calculation which
indicates her intention to make a restitution of the money
she has used of the forty thousand dollars We see too her
bankbook The paper reads thus top figure 40000 directly
beneath it 500 the amount used for the new car total after
subtraction 39500 In another spot we see a figure which
matches the balance in her bankbook 62400

Beneath this is the figure 500 and the amount after
subtraction 12400 She studies the figures sighs not
wearily but with a certain satisfaction with the pleasure
that comes when one knows that at any cost one is going to
continue doing the right thing After a moment she tears the
page out of the notebook and rising begins to rip it into
small pieces She goes into the bathroom drops the pieces
into the toilet bowl flushes the toilet Then she drops her
robe and steps into the tub and turns the shower on

INT MARY IN SHOWER
Over the bar on which hangs the shower curtain we can see
the bathroom door not entirely closed For a moment we watch

Mary as she washes and soaps herself

There is still a small worry in her eyes but generally she
looks somewhat relieved

Now we see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open

The noise of the shower drowns out any sound The door is
then slowly and carefully closed

And we see the shadow of a woman fall across the shower
curtain Marys back is turned to the curtain The white
brightness of the bathroom is almost blinding

Suddenly we see the hand reach up grasp the shower curtain
rip it aside

CUT TO
MARY - ECU
As she turns in response to the feel and SOUND of the shower

curtain being torn aside A look of pure horror erupts in
her face A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her
throat A hand comes into the shot The hand holds an enormous
bread knife The flint of the blade shatters the screen to
an almost total silver blankness

THE SLASHING

An impression of a knife slashing as if tearing at the very
screen ripping the film Over it the brief gulps of
screaming And then silence And then the dreadful thump as
Marys body falls in the tub

REVERSE ANGLE

The blank whiteness the blur of the shower water the hand
pulling the shower curtain back We catch one flicker of a
glimpse of the murderer A woman her face contorted with
madness her head wild with hair as if she were wearing a
fright-wig And then we see only the curtain closed across
the tub and hear the rush of the shower water Above the
shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a
moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming

CUT TO
THE DEAD BODY

Lying half in half out of the tub the head tumbled over
touching the floor the hair wet one eye wide open as if
popped one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor
Coming down the side of the tub running thick and dark along
the porcelain we see many small threads of blood CAMERA
FOLLOWS away from the body travels slowly across the
bathroom past the toilet out into the bedroom As CAMERA
approaches the bed we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed
it on the bedside table

CLOSE UP - THE NEWSPAPER
beside the bed The CAMERA now moves away over to the window
and looks up to the house and as it gets there we HEAR
coming from within the house the SOUND of Normans fearful
shocked voice
NORMANS VOICE
Mother Oh God what blood
blood mother

We cannot entirely distinguish these exclamations

After a moment or two of silence Norman emerges from the
front door dashes down the path toward the motel

QUICK CUT TO
EXT THE PATH - (NIGHT)

Norman is coming AT CAMERA running head-on He dashes into
an extreme close up and we see the terror and fear ripe in
his face CAMERA PANS as Norman races past holds as Norman
runs to the porch and quickly along it and directly to Marys
room

INT MARYS CABIN - (NIGHT)

Norman pauses a moment in the doorway glances about the
room hears the shower going sees the bathroom door is open
He goes to the bathroom looks in sees the body

Slowly almost carefully he raises his hands to his face
covers his eyes turns his face away Then he crosses to the
window looks out at the house Shot is so angled that we
see the bedside table with the newspaper on it

After a moment Norman moves from the window sinks onto the
edge of the bed

FRESH ANGLE - BEHIND NORMAN

Norman sitting on bed the bathroom in bg of shot We can
see only the hand of the dead girl lying along the tile
floor Norman presses his eyes fights to find a way out of
his dilemma Slowly a kind of settling comes upon him the
peace that comes with decision

Norman rises goes to the window looks out and then with
resolution closes the window and draws the curtain across
it Then he crosses to the front window facing the porch
and draws those curtains closed Then he switches off the
bedroom light leaving the room lit only by the spill from
the bathroom He opens the front door goes out

EXT THE HOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

Norman comes out of Marys cabin closes the door carefully
behind him goes along the porch to his office goes in We
stay outside Immediately the Vacancy sign goes off and
then the motel sign goes off As CAMERA GOES closer to the
office the lights within go off and we HEAR a closet door
opening and then the SOUND of a pail being picked up Norman
comes out of office closes door looks cautiously about
goes along porch carrying pail with mop in it goes into
Marys cabin closing the door after him

INT MARYS CABIN

With the paper in the foreground Norman enters We can see
him in the dim spill of light He pauses by the door then
gathers his strength and goes into the bathroom We HEAR him
set the pail on the tiled floor and then we HEAR the shower
being turned off And there is total silence CAMERA MOVES
FORWARD so that we can see into bathroom

CAMERA is ANGLED that we see Norman only from the waist up
Quickly and deftly he unhooks the shower curtain emerges
with it into the bedroom CAMERA PANS down and we see him
spread the shower curtain on the bedroom floor just outside
the bathroom door He spreads the curtain so that one end of
it comes up against the bathroom threshold and slightly over
and onto the tile floor Again he goes into the bathroom and
CAMERA TILTS up so that we see only the upper half of Norman
He works carefully with his arms extended away from his
body slowly pulls the dead body out of the tub drags it
across the tile floor and onto the spread-out shower curtain
in the bedroom Having arranged the body he straightens up
examines his hands sees bloodstains on them He returns to
the bathroom goes to the hand-basin

CLOSE SHOT

We see his hands being washed see the bloodstains being
diluted and washed away by the gush of the faucet water

NORMAN

We see Norman shake his hands free of the water then turn
to the job of cleaning the bathroom

He places the pail in the tub runs water into it dips the
mop in swabs the tile floor With a towel he wipes off the
wall over the tub and the edges and sides of the tub and
even the shower curtain rod Then he takes a second towel
and goes over the cleaned areas carefully drying them
Finally he rinses and squeezes out the mop empties the pail
cleans out the tub and goes out into the bedroom

INT MARYS BEDROOM

Norman steps carefully around the unseen body crosses to
the desk starts going through Marys handbag in search of
her car keys He suddenly notices them lying on the desk
where hed thrown them after parking her car He picks up
the keys crosses the room goes out

EXT THE PORCH

We see Norman pauses at the door check cautiously then
hurry across the porch and into Marys car He circle-turns
the car so that its trunk is backed up to the turns porch
directly opposite Marys door as close as it can go

Then he alights goes to the trunk opens it with the key
and leaving the trunk lid raised goes back into the cabin

INT MARYS ROOM

From a raised angle we see Norman bend down and begin to
wrap the shower curtain around the body We see the edges of
the curtain as they are raised and laid down again Then he
picks up the wrapped body crosses to the door uses his

foot to pull the door open and leaving the door open behind
him goes quickly across the porch and gently lays the body
in the trunk He closes the lid then but does not lock it
He comes back into the cabin closes the door completely
flicks on the light

Again the newspaper is in the foreground For a moment he
pauses closes his eyes against the realization of what he

is doing then quickly pushes all thoughts away continues
with his work With the room lighted he now proceeds to
gather up all Marys articles and toss them into the suitcase
He checks all drawers and the closet gets down and checks
under bed and bureau goes into the bathroom checks that
room again comes back into the bedroom looks about
carefully spots Marys handbag throws even that into the
suitcase is finally satisfied that all traces of the girl
are gone from the room Then he closes Marys suitcase picks
it up

With his free hand he picks up the pail in which are the
mop and the used towels He crosses to the door switches
off the light with his shoulder pulls open the door starts
out

EXT THE PORCH

As Norman stands in the doorway he is suddenly and blindingly
lit by the bright headlights of a passing car The flash of
the lights and the SOUND of the SPEEDING CAR are over in a
flicker of a moment but it takes a few seconds for Norman

to regain his former tense composure Then he goes to the

car trunk raises it with his foot throws the suitcase and
the pail into it slams it shut He pauses a moment then
realizes he has left the bathroom light on in Marys cabin
He returns to cabin As he enters his eye is caught by the
newspaper on the bedside table He goes to it takes the
newspaper and looks once again into the bathroom His glance
goes right over the toilet bowl

He turns out the lights crosses the darkened cabin goes
out onto the porch

He reopens the trunk tosses in the newspaper and closes it
He goes around and jumps into the car and starts away

We HOLD on the trunk follow it for a while then
DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE SWAMP - (NIGHT)

The car pulls away from a CLOSE ANGLE on the trunk and as
CAMERA HOLDS we see that we are now in a swamp area

It is quiet except for the irritating noises of night insects
Norman stops the car at the very edge of the swamp turns

off the lights gets out leaving door open He looks at the
swamp seems doubtful of its ability to swallow up the car
realizes he has no choice He leans into the car releases
the emergency brake starts to push The front of the car
begins to roll into the swamp Suddenly there is the LOW
THROBBING SOUND of a motor Norman freezes listens

The SOUND grows louder and Norman realizes it is an airplane
flying overhead The car is rolling quickly now Norman jumps
away Slams the door shut stands tense The SOUND of the
plane overhead grows louder

Norman looks up
NORMANS VIEWPOINT - THE BLACK SKY

We see no plane The SOUND of the motor is beginning to
diminish

CUT BACK TO

NORMAN
We see the relief in his face He looks at the car

More than two-thirds of it have already sunk into the swamp
The trunk alone seems to hold poised above the sand and slime
as if refusing to go the rest of the way Norman begins to
panic he steps dangerously close pushes with his foot And
slowly the car sinks until finally it is gone and we hear
only the gentle plop of the swamps final gulp and see only
the small after-bubble like a visual burp

Norman waits a moment then begins stamping out the tire
marks so obvious in the wet ground around the swamp

He stamps and drags his feet over the markings as we
DISSOLVE TO
CLOSE UP NORMAN

standing on the porch of the motel leaning against a post
He is staring out into the night a look of guarded casual
innocence on his face as if he were taking one last moment
of peaceful night air before retiring Then he glances down
and CAMERA follows his gaze A hose is lying on the ground

outside Marys cabin its stream of water obliterating the

tire marks

After a moment Normans hand comes into shot picks up hose
places it in a new position As CAMERA PULLS BACK we see
that the water from the hose has erased and rearranged the
road markings so that it would be impossible to tell that a
car had been parked here

After a short wait Norman goes to the hose-faucet turns it
off unscrews the hose As he rolls the hose he walks away
from the spot past the office heading for the path that

leads to the house He goes up the path pauses at the steps
of the house tosses the curled hose onto the lawn goes up
the steps and into the house CAMERA FOLLOWS him in PAUSES
as he pauses at the foot of the stairs Norman goes up the
stairs

On the landing he stops The door to his mothers room is
closed Lying in a heap outside the door are a blood-stained
dress and a pair of elderly-womans shoes From an EXTREMELY
HIGH ANGLE we look down on Norman as he bends to pick up
the stained dress and shoes

He rolls the shoes into the dress tucks the small neat
bundle under his arm and starts down the stairs heading
for the basement

EXT A LONG SHOT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (NIGHT)

It stands silhouetted against the sky There is a long wait
Then slowly a curl of smoke comes out of the chimney

FADE OUT

FADE IN
INT BACK ROOM OF SAMS HARDWARE STORE IN FAIRVALE - (DAY)
Sam is seated at his desk writing a letter Sequence

begins with CAMERA IN CLOSE over Sams shoulder and we can
read as mush as he has written of the letter The letterhead
reads Sam Loomis - Hardware and the letter reads Dearest
right-as-always Mary Im sitting in this tiny back room
which isnt big enough for both of us and suddenly it looks
big enough for both of us So what if were poor and cramped
and miserable at least well be happy If you havent come
to your senses and still want to

CAMERA begins PULLING AWAY as Sam turns the sheet of paper
over continues backing away out of the small back room and
heads backwards down the corridor we see a young clerk

BOB SUMMERFIELD Sams assistant standing behind the counter
a look of handsome patience on his face He is waiting on a
meticulous elderly woman customer who is holding and
examining a large can of insecticide As CAMERA PASSES

WOMAN CUSTOMER
They tell you what its ingredients
are and how its guaranteed to
exterminate any insect in the world
but they do not tell you whether or
not its painless And I say insect
or man death should always be
painless

CAMERA by this has reached the front door of the hardware
store and we now see a girl standing just inside the door
She is an attractive girl with a rather definite manner a
look of purposefulness She carries a handbag and a small
overnight case She is Marys sister LILA CRANE

Bob Summerfield has noticed Lila smiles brightly at her
gives her an I1ll-be-with-you-in-a-moment nod

Lila starts to walk toward the counter never taking her
eyes off Bob As she approaches she asks quietly

LILA
Sam

SUMMERFIELD
You want to see Sam

LILA
Sam Loomis
SUMMERFIELD
(yelling toward back

room)
Sam Lady wants to see you

Lila looks to the back room The woman customer goes on
worriedly examining the fine print of the insecticide can
Sam comes to the door of his room pauses looks at Lila a
moment starts toward her his expression indicating that he
does not know her Lila studies him with a quiet worried
expression

SAM
Yes

LILA
May I talk to you

SAM
(a bit mystified)
Sure

Lila glances at the customer and the clerk turns starts
toward the front of the store Sam holds a moment then
follows As he reaches her she turns her eyes studying him
intently as she says

LILA
Im Marys sister

SAM
Lila

LILA
(quickly)
Is Mary here

Sam is mystified and is also aware of the worried hostile
expression on Lilas face He studies her for a quiet moment
Behind them is a display o

and wearing a satisfied smile

WOMAN CUSTOMER

LILA
A good reason I suppose

SAM
(Slightly exasperated)
Well what do you think we eloped or

LILA
Mr Loomis youre so busy being
defensive that you havent even
reacted to the most serious fact of
all Mary is missing

SAM

defensive

LILA
Look if you two are in this thing

SUMMERFIELD

the anxiety and fear building up in her
beginning to fill with worried tears

goes out through the back way

Sam studies her for a

speaks with soft seriousness

LILA

SAM

LILA

(A pause)

I hate tears

(Takes out hankie)

SAM
Is Mary in trouble

(Almost a smile)
You men and your egos

SAM

Their attention is distracted by a man who has strolled
quietly into the room He ignores them walks past them
goes behind the counter takes down a sign reading CLOSED
FOR LUNCH walks back to the door closes door hangs the

sign across the door

window locks the door turns to Sam

and Lila folds his arms smiles a particularly unfriendly

smile

ARBOGAST

Lets all talk about Mary

ARBOGAST

Milt Arbogast Private Investigator
(To Lila)

Where is she

Miss Crane

LILA
ARBOGAST
Wouldnt have been able to tail you

SAM
Whats your interest

ARBOGAST
Money

There is a moments silence and then unable to tolerate the
sudden frightening happenings Sam explodes

SAM
Somebody better tell me whats going
on and tell me fast I can take so
much and then

ARBOGAST
(Interrupting calmly)
Your girl friend stole forty thousand
dollars

Sam looks at Arbogast in utter shock and in that state asks
one of those seemingly ridiculous questions

SAM
Why

ARBOGAST
(An almost amused
smile)
Mustve needed it

SAM
What are you talking about
(To Lila)
What is this
LILA

She was supposed to bank it on
Friday for her boss She didnt

And no one has seen her since

ARBOGAST
(Looking at Sam)
Someone has seen her Someone always
sees a girl with forty thousand
dollars
(To Sam)
She is your girl friend isnt she

LILA
Sam they dont want to prosecute
they just want the money back It
was all in cash
ARBOGAST
(Correcting with
Cassidys word)
Casharoonie

LILA
Sam if shes here

SAM
She isnt

A real look of anguish comes into Lilas face And Arbogast
studies it then speaks

ARBOGAST
You came up here on a hunch Miss
Crane Nothing more No phone call
from him or from your sister herself

LILA
(wearily)
Not even a hunch Just hope

ARBOGAST
With a little checking I could get
to believe you

LILA
(anxiously)

I dont care if you do or I want
to see Mary before she gets in
any deeper

SAM
Did you check in Phoenix
hospitals maybe she had an
accident a hold-up

ARBOGAST

She was seen leaving town in her
car Seen by her very victims I
might add

SAM
(after a moment)

I dont believe it
(to Lila slowly)

Do you
LILA
(a thoughtful pause)
Yes I just did The moment
they told me
SAM

You might have doubted for say five
minutes or so Sister

Lila turns from Sam a flush of guilt and regret in her face
Arbogast looks at her quiet sympathetically

ARBOGAST

Were always quickest to doubt people
who have a record for being honest
I think shes here Miss Crane Where
theres a boyfriend

(Trails off smiles

encouragingly)
She wont be back there among the
nuts and bolts but shell be in
this town somewhere Ill find
her

He nods takes down the closed-for-lunch sign sails it to
the counter opens door goes out into the street

After a quiet moment

LILA
I just listened and believed
everything they told me She stole
the money We dont want to get
her in trouble No dont bring the
police in

SAM
It was her boss idea not to report
it to the police

LILA
No The man whose money she he
talked so loud and fast and I I

shouldve called the police

SAM
He must have had a darn good reason
for wanting them kept out of it
All that cash

LILA
I ought to call the police right
now

SAM
No

LILA

Why not Sam is she hiding here
Are you two planning to go away with
the money

SAM
How could I go away Im in debt up
to my

(Smiles at the

incongruity of his

reply then goes

serious)
If she did steal that money Its
hard to believe she did because its
hard to see why she would Unless
she had some wild idea that it would
help me us

LILA
She havent even called you

SAM
I didnt see her and I didnt
hear from her Believe that

LILA
I need to I need to believe
something This is the first time
Ive ever come up against anything I
couldnt understand

SAM
Youve led a charmed life

LILA
No I just think anything can be
explained But Mary doing a thing
like this I dont know how to
handle

SAM

Maybe we can handle it together
(He smiles
encouragingly)

LILA
(A rueful shrug)
I came flying up here expecting to
get some explanation for all I
know she may be trying to get in
touch with me at home Id better
go home

SAM
(A thoughtful pause)
I think shell contact me if she
contacts anybody Why dont you stay
here When she shows up or calls
be here

LILA
(A long study her
suspicion of him
evaporating)
You want me to stay here

SAM
Shell need both of us

LILA
(considers then)
Where can I stay
SAM
(brightly)
First rate hotel fifty yards up the
street Come on
(as he reaches for
the closed-for-lunch
sign)
After we check you in well go to
the drugstore and get you a sandwich
Then well come back here and
wait

He hangs the sign on the door ushers Lila out closes door
behind him

and goes back out of scene A pause and it reappears on the
old road and slowly makes its way toward the Bates Motel
EXT THE BATES HOUSE AND MOTEL - (TWILIGHT)
We now see Norman He has brought out an old rocking chair
and has placed it on the office porch and is sitting hunched
in it And he is darning one of his own socks CAMERA HOLDS
Beyond the porch and Norman we see the old house and can
barely make out in the twilight dimness the figure of his
mother seated at the window Here too there is that quality

of quiet peace surrounded by a vague foreboding

Now Norman looks up at the SOUND of the approaching car
And continues looking as the car comes to a stop and Arbogast
gets out Arbogast gives the place a quick once-over gazes
at Norman starts forward In his steps and manner there is
that bored routine-logged quality of a man who has seen too
many motels and asked question of too many hotel managers
over too short a period of time

Norman rises as Arbogast comes forward

NORMAN

(shoving sock in his

pocket)
I always forget to put the sign on
but we do have vacancy

(Cheerfully)
Twelve in fact Twelve cabins twelve
vacancies

ARBOGAST
(pleasantly)
In the past two days Ive been to so
many motels my eyes are bleary with
neon This is the first one that
looked like it was hiding from the
world at large

NORMAN
I dont really forget the sign it
just doesnt seem any use
(Points)

This used to be the main highway
(Starts for office)
Want to register please

ARBOGAST
Sit down I dont want to trouble
you just want to ask

NORMAN

No trouble Todays linen day I
change all the beds once a week
whether theyve been used or not
dampness I hate the smell of
dampness

(Opening office door)
Its such a dank smell

Norman is holding the door open so Arbogast walks in
Norman follows

INT MOTEL OFFICE - (TWILIGHT)

Norman switches on the overhead light starts for the linen

closet suddenly pauses turns studies Arbogast who has
remained standing by the door
NORMAN
You out to buy a motel

ARBOGAST
No

NORMAN
Oh I thought you said youd been
to so many in two days What was

it you wanted to ask

ARBOGAST
Im looking for a missing person
(takes out and opens
wallet and extends
it as he speaks)
My names Arbogast private
investigator
(takes back wallet
when Norman doesnt
look at it)
Trying to trace a young girl whos
been missing almost a week From
Phoenix
(A look at Normans
frightened expression)
Its a private matter family wants
to forgive her
(smiles)
She isnt in trouble

NORMAN
(forcing a smile)
I didnt think the police went
searching for people who werent in
trouble

ARBOGAST
Im not the police

NORMAN
Oh

He waits a moment then opens closet starts counting out
sheets and pillow cases keeps his back to Arbogast

Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket talks as he
crosses to Norman

ARBOGAST
We have reason to believe she came
this way might have stopped in
this area
(extends photograph
which Norman doesnt
glance at)
Did she stop here

NORMAN
No No one has stopped here in
weeks

ARBOGAST

Mind looking at the picture before
committing yourself

NORMAN
Committing myself to what You sure
talk like a Policeman

ARBOGAST
Look at the picture Please

Norman glances briefly turns away lifts sheets and pillow
cases off the shelf holds them close almost protectively

NORMAN
No At least I dont recall

ARBOGAST
She might have used an alias Mary
Cranes the real name but she
mightve registered

NORMAN
(interrupting)
I dont even bother with guests
registering any more I mean little

by little you drop the formalities
(more relaxed because
Arbogast is listening
with a pleasant smile)
I shouldnt even bother to change
the linen I guess habits die hard
Which reminds me

He goes to the wall flips a light switch

NORMAN
The vacancy sign Just in case

We had a couple the other night said if the sign hasnt
been on theyd have thought this was an old deserted mining
town or something

ARBOGAST
Now theres a couple even remarking
about your sign and see how easily
you forgot them

NORMAN
What
ARBOGAST
You thought no one has stopped here
in weeks Now try to remember if
this girl

ARBOGAST
(A pause a study)
Maybe she even signed the register
because habits die hard Lets check
it huh

Norman says nothing Arbogast goes to the desk pulls the
registry book around flips back a page or two

Norman simply stares at the man Arbogast hums faintly
pleasantly as he examines the pages Then

ARBOGAST
Yes sir Marie Samuels Interesting
alias

He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket lays it beside
the signature in the registry book all the while nodding
and smiling nicely as if this discovery will make Norman as
happy as it is making him

ARBOGAST

Dont know where she got Marie
but Samuels figures Her boy
friends name is Sam

(Turns to Norman the

smile gone)
Was she in disguise Or do you want
to check the picture again

NORMAN
I didnt lie to you I just have
trouble keeping track of time

Arbogast has reached him the picture extended Norman looks
dutifully at it

NORMAN
It was raining and her hair didnt
look like that damped out I guess
ARBOGAST

Tell me all about her

NORMAN
She arrived kind of late wet and
hungry and she was very tired and
went right to bed and left early

ARBOGAST

(as if pleasantly
exasperated)

(laughs shakes his
head)
Come on

He starts out Arbogast pauses momentarily confused by the
young mans openness

CUT TO
EXT THE MOTEL PORCH - (NIGHT)

Norman walks down the porch hesitates before Cabin One
walks on a bit toward Cabin Two stops turns to see if
Arbogast is following Arbogast has come out onto the porch
but is not following He has walked to the opposite end of
the porch and is standing at its edge looking up at the old
house The upstairs window is in darkness The neon of the
Vacancy and Motel signs splash strange light over the scene

NORMAN
Change your mind

Arbogast does not reply Norman becomes apprehensive starts
to Arbogast forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful

NORMAN
I guess Ive got one of those faces
you cant help believing

ARBOGAST
(to Norman but
continuing to stare
at the house)
Anyone at home

NORMAN
I live there Alone

ARBOGAST
Someone is sitting in that window

NORMAN
My mother

Arbogast turns gazes seriously at him

NORMAN
Shes ill Confined to her room
Its practically living alone

ARBOGAST
(after a pause)
If this girl Mary Crane were here
youd have no reason to hide her
would you

NORMAN
Of course not
ARBOGAST
If she paid you well

NORMAN
Now look

ARBOGAST
Or if she had you say gallantly
protecting her you wouldnt be
fooled youd know she was just
using you Wouldnt you

NORMAN
Im not a fool And Im not capable
of being fooled Not even by women

ARBOGAST
I didnt mean that as a slur on your
manhood Im sorry

NORMAN
(disturbed now)
Thats all right maybe she could
have fooled me But
(a rueful smile)
She didnt fool my mother

ARBOGAST
Your mother met her
(quickly)
Can I talk to your mother

NORMAN
No I told you shes confined

ARBOGAST
Just for a moment She might have
picked up a hint youd miss

ARBOGAST
Sick old women are sharp Come on I
wont disturb

NORMAN
No Just no I have one of those
breaking points like any other man
believe it or not and Im near it
Theres just so much pushing I can
take and I think

ARBOGAST
All right
(starts away toward
his car pauses)
Might save me a lot of leg-work if I
could just talk to your mother But
Id need a warrant for that wont
I

Norman does not respond Arbogast gets in his car starts
the motor Norman looks up studies the mans face his own
face showing apprehension Arbogast backs the car around
very slowly his gaze divided between the old house and the
lighted window of Cabin Two As he turns the car out his
headlights light up the porch

Norman stands watching him drive away

DISSOLVE TO

A distant view of the House and Motel There is a light on
in the house There is also a light on in Normans office
We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch
toward the distant cabins He carries sheets on his arm He
goes into the last cabin and switches the light on Into the
foreground the hood of the white Ford enters the scene and
stops Arbogast gets out He goes over to the Motel office

dashes up the stone steps to the House

MEDIUM SHOT

CAMERA HOLDS as Arbogast goes up onto the porch The house
is dark within except as we can now see for a faint spill
of light in the foyer light which comes from the upstairs
hall Arbogast goes to the living room window looks in
sees only darkness Then he goes to the door listens for
along moment hears nothing

Very slowly almost painfully he turns the knob of the door
and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder The door begins
to open He allows it to open just enough for him to slip
through and into the foyer

CUT TO
INT FOYER OF BATES HOUSE - (NIGHT)

Arbogast gradually eases the door closed stands against it
waiting He looks up in the direction of the light sees no
one The door at the head of the stairs is closed Arbogast
listens holds his breath hears what could be human sounds
coming from upstairs but realizes these could also be the
sounds of an old house after sunset After a careful wait
he crosses to the stairs starts up slowly guardedly
placing a foot squarely on each step to test it for squeaks
or groans before placing his full weight on it CAMERA
FOLLOWS remaining on floor level but TRAVELLING ALONG the
stairway as Arbogast makes his way up

CUT TO

EXTREMELY HIGH ANGLE
INT STAIRWAY AND UPSTAIRS LANDING

We see Arbogast coming up the stairs And now we see too
the door of the mothers room opening carefully and slowly

As Arbogast reaches the landing the door opens and the mother
steps out her hand raises high the blade of an enormous
knife flashing

CU - A BIG HEAD OF AN ASTONISHED ARBOGAST

The knife slashes across his cheek and neck Blood spurts
The sudden attack throws him off balance He stumbles back
and staggers down the whole of the staircase He frantically
gropes for the balustrade as he goes backwards down the
stairs The CAMERA FOLLOWS him all the way A wicked knife
keeps thrusting itself into the foreground As he collapses
at the bottom the black head and shoulders of Mrs Bates
plunges into the foreground as the CAMERA MOVES IN to contain
the raising and descending murder weapon

INT BACK ROOM OF HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)

Lila is sitting close by the phone and looks as if she hasnt
moved from it in the last hour Sam is pacing occasionally
stopping at the window glancing out pacing again The ash
tray close to Lila is filled

There is a thick atmosphere of smoke tension and weariness
in the small otherwise cozy room

SAM

rises)

anxiety goes to the phone dials operator

Contemplate your panic button

He hurries down to the street door and out CAMERA HOLDS on
Lila as she stares after Sam As she stands alone in the
darkened store all the hardware seems to take on sinister
shapes

Among some bathroom fittings a nozzle from a shower falls
onto the floor

Lila turns and picks if from the floor and puts it back in
its place She turns and again looks to the deserted street
with a touch of anxiety She gives a slight unconscious
shiver

DISSOLVE TO

Tall and lonely still against the moonlight the figure of
Norman silhouetted He doesnt move merely stands there at
the edge of the swamp staring down at the now calm and quiet
face of it

CUT TO
EXT THE MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)

All light are out except the light in Normans mothers
room And her figure can be seen sitting in the window
relaxed in a high-back chair her face turned into the room
After a second we hear the SOUND OF A MOTOR and then Sams
small pick-up truck swings into the driveway

Sam stops the motor automatically switches off headlights
pauses as he observes the silence and darkness of the area
Then he hops out of the cab goes quickly to the office
knocks on the door As he waits for a response he looks

down the long porch studies the darkened cabins knocks
again louder looks in the other direction and sees the

house and the figure at the one lit window He stares a moment
then calls loudly

Arbogast
CUT TO
EXT THE SWAMP

The silhouette of Norman He is still Over shot very dimly
comes the SOUND OF SAMS VOICE calling again for Arbogast

Norman turns slowly until in silhouette we see his profile

his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in

the direction of the house There is silence for a moment

and then again the SOUND of Sam POUNDING at the door
DISSOLVE TO

INT HARDWARE STORE - (NIGHT)

The store is in darkness only the glow from the back room
spilling in
LSs

With CAMERA placed with its back to the street door we can
see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in
the back room beyond There is a SOUND of a car pulling up
The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back
room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a BIG HEAD
We see Lilas desperate anxious look

MEDIUM SHOT

From her viewpoint we see Sam alighting from his truck and
coming toward the door of the store He enters He and Lila
exchange quiet glances

SAM
He didnt come back here

LILA
(worriedly)
Sam

SAM
No Arbogast No Bates And only the
old lady at home

(frowning)
A sick old lady unable to answer the
door or unwilling
LILA

Where could he have gone

SAM
Maybe he got some definite lead
Maybe he went right on

LILA
Without calling me

SAM
In a hurry

LILA
Sam he called me when he had nothing
definite nothing but a dissatisfied
feeling Dont you think hed have
called if he had anything

SAM
(interrupting)
Yes I think he would have

Lila goes quiet Sam starts toward the back room pauses at
the doorway turns Lila has remained by the door looking
out at the street She feels his pause turns and for a
moment they share at each other across the darkened room

SAM

MOVES IN on Sam and Lila as they remain for a moment in the
trucks cab staring quietly at the sleeping house

SAM

SAM
No Im just procrastinating People

middle of the night
(gives up starts out)
Come on

He gets out of cab goes around to help Lila She is already
out CAMERA FOLLOWS them up the small path to the front door
Sam presses the bell button Both he and Lila are almost
knocked over by the shocking clanging ear-splitting BLAST
OF THE BELL within the house a ring which sounds more like
a fire alarm than a doorbell

He tries to smile fails Lila doesnt even try The
downstairs hall light goes on and a moment later the door is
unhesitatingly opened by MRS CHAMBERS a small lively stick
of a woman wrapped in a thick flannel robe and a corona of
hospitality
MRS CHAMBERS

Oh

MRS CHAMBERS

(a cross look up at
the bell)

SHERIFF CHAMBERS comes down the stairs in a bathrobe which
matches his wifes He is a tall narrow man with a face
originally destined for Mount Rushmore He nods at Sam looks
at him with wide-awake eyes and a no-nonsense concern

SAM
We have a problem

MRS CHAMBERS
(to Lila)
Lets go out back and have some coca
while the men are talking

LILA
No thank you Its my problem too

SAM
I dont know where to start
(a look at Lila)
Except at the beginning

SAM

(to Sheriff)
This is Lila Crane from Phoenix

private detective helping and
well we got a call tonight from
this detective saying hed traced
Mary

MRS CHAMBERS
Mary is Lilas sister

SAM
Yes He traced her to that motel
out on the old highway

MRS CHAMBERS
(to the Sheriff)
Bates Motel
(to Lila)
He has a mind like a mechanical brain
and the more information you feed
it Go on Sam

SAM
He traced her there and called us to
say he was going to question Mrs
Bates

MRS CHAMBERS
(a pleasant shock)
Norman took a wife

SAM
No An old woman his mother
(to Sheriff quickly)
That was early this evening And we
havent seen or heard from him since
I went out to the motel just got
back No one was in the office and
LILA
(interrupting
anxiously)
Will you help us I think somethings
wrong out there

SHERIFF
(after a considerate
pause)
Now Your sister is missing how long

LILA
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday
And no trace until

SHERIFF
Howd you and this detective come to
trace her to Fairvale

SAM
They thought shed be coming to me

SHERIFF
Left Phoenix under her own steam

LILA
Yes

SHERIFF
(a pause)
She aint missing so much as shes
run away

SAM
Yes

SHERIFF
From what

LILA

(a look at sam then)
She stole some money

SHERIFF
A lot

LILA
Forty thousand dollars

SHERIFF
And the police havent been able
to

SAM
(interrupting)
Everyone concerned thought if
they could get her to give back the
money they could avoid involving
her with the police

SHERIFF

Explains the private detective He
traced her to the Bates place Whatd
he exactly say when he called you

LILA
Mary had been there one night and
had left

SHERIFF
With the forty thousand dollars

LILA

He didnt mention the money

(anxiously)
What he said on the phone isnt
important is it He was supposed
to come back after he spoke to the
mother and he didnt Thats what I
want you to do something about

SHERIFF
Like what

LILA
Go out there Find somebody ask
some questions

(a pause)
Im sorry if I seem over-anxious to
you I keep thinking somethings

wrong I have to know what

SHERIFF
I think somethings wrong too Miss
But not the same thing I think your
private detective is whats wrong
(As Lila is about to
object)
I think he got himself a hot lead as
to where your sister was going
probably from Norman Bates and
called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money

LILA
He said he was dissatisfied and
was going back

MRS CHAMBERS
(to Sheriff)
Why dont you call Norman and let
him say just what happened if he
give the man a hot lead and he did
just scooted off itll make the
girl feel better Albert

SHERIFF
At this hour

SAM
He was out when I was there If hes
back he probably isnt even in bed
yet

SHERIFF
He wasnt out when you were there
He just wasnt answering the door in
the dead of night like some people
do This fellow lives like a hermit

MRS CHAMBERS
Recluse Kinder word

SHERIFF
(to Sam)
You must remember that bad business
out there About ten years ago

SAM
Ive only been here five Right now
it feels like ten but

LILA
All right Then call At least call

Mrs Chambers goes to phone dials operator

MRS CHAMBERS
(into phone)

connect him with the Bates Motel

She hands the receiver to the Sheriff He takes it
reluctantly listens to the dim sound of RINGING on the other
end After a moment

SHERIFF

Mrs Chambers)

SAM
(faint irony)
Was that all

SHERIFF
This detective was out there and
Norman told him about the girl and
the detective thanked him and went
away

LILA
And he didnt go back Didnt see
the mother

The Sheriff looks long at Lila shakes his head
sympathetically

SHERIFF
You shouldve called in the police
the second you found your sister has
skipped You go starting private
investigations using people you
dont even know

LILA
What difference does that

SHERIFF
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced

lie

MRS CHAMBERS
Barefaced

SHERIFF
He told you he wasnt coming right
back cause he wanted to question
Norman Bates mother right

LILA
Yes

SHERIFF
(a pause then calmly)
Norman Bates mother has been dead
and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for
the last ten years

There is a long silence Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff

MRS CHAMBERS
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in Periwinkle blue

SHERIFF
It aint only local history Sam
its the only murder-and-suicide
case in Fairvale ledgers Mrs
Bates poisoned this guy she was
involved with when she found out he
was married then took a helping of
the same stuff herself Strychnine
Ugly way to die

MRS CHAMBERS
Norman found them dead together In
bed

SAM
You mean that old woman I saw sittin
in the window wasnt Norman Bates
mother

MRS CHAMBERS
(hopefully happily)
Maybe you saw Mary

SAM
Id know the difference between Mary
and an old woman

SHERIFF
Now wait a minute Sam You sure you
saw an old woman

SAM
Yes In the house behind the motel
I pounded and called but she just

ignored me
SHERIFF
And you want to tell me you saw Norman
Bates mother

LILA
It mustve been Arbogast said so
too and he said the young man
wouldnt let him see her because she
was ill

The Sheriff stares at both of them and when he finally speaks
there is an almost inaudible tone or irony in his voice

SHERIFF
Well if the woman up there is Mrs
Bates whos that woman buried out

at Greenlawn Cemetery
QUICK CUT TO
INT NORMANS PARLOR BEHIND OFFICE - (NIGHT)

Norman sits in the dim one-lamp light the phone next to
him his hand still near it as if he had not been able to
move his hand after hanging up He is staring at the shrike-
like bird which is perched on the lamp shade Decision and
resolution are beginning to show in his face Suddenly he
rises starts quickly out of the room tries to switch off
the lamp as he goes and in so doing succeeds only in knocking
the bird off the shade

He watches it fall does not try to catch it It hits the
floor with a thud and sawdust spills out He stares sadly at
it for a moment then tends down scoops up the sawdust
tries to press it into the split seam picks up the bird
puts it in a drawer Then he puts out the lamp goes out
crosses the darkened office and goes outside

CUT TO
EXT MOTEL AND HOUSE - (NIGHT)

Norman comes off the porch walks to the path and directly
up to the house opens the door and goes in

CUT TO
INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRWAY - (NIGHT)
SHOOTING UP THE STAIRS

Norman goes up pauses one moment outside his mothers door
then opens it and goes in leaving the door open

For a moment we hear only Normans low quiet voice his
words indistinguishable Then we hear the cold shot of his
mothers derisive laughter

MOTHERS VOICE
I am sorry boy but you do manage
to look ludicrous when you give me
orders

NORMANS VOICE
Please mother

MOTHERS VOICE

(Sharp laughter all

gone)
No I will not hide in the fruit
cellar

(A shrill laugh)
Think Im fruity huh

(Hard cold again)
Im staying right here This is my
room and no one will drag me out of
it least of all my big bold son

NORMANS VOICE

(Rising now anxiously)
Theyll come now Mother He came
after the girl and now someone will
come after him How long do you think
you can go on Mother please
just for a few days just so they
wont find you

MOTHERS VOICE

(Mimicking)
Just for a few days

(Furious)
In that dank fruit cellar No You

(A pause quiet)
I told you to get out boy

(A longer pause)
Norman What do you think youre
going to do Dont you touch me

(A pause then

cajolingly)
All right son put me down and Ill
go Ill go on my own two feet I
can go on my own two feet cant I

During all this the CAMERA has been slowly creeping up the
stairs It does not stop at the top however but continues

on the same high angle that we had in Scene 57

She starts to laugh a terrible sound like an obscene melody
NORMANS VOICE
Ill carry you mother

Norman comes out of the room his mother held in his arms
her head leaning against his shoulder He carries her down
the stairs along the lower landing to the cellar stairs
and then down those stairs to the basement

DISSOLVE TO
EXT FAIRVALE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH - (MORNING)

An overcast morning but a sunny-faced crowd The service is
just over there is contentment and peace and just a little
I-went-to-church-smugness in the faces of the churchgoers as
they come out of the chapel and spread their separate ways
away

Amongst the crowd waiting and searching the faces are Sam
and Lila In their expressions there is no peace no
contentment CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE They are not speaking
Lila looks as if she has had no sleep

Suddenly Sam becomes alert takes Lilas arm starts toward
the church

CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM stops as they approach Sheriff and
Mrs Chambers The Sheriff stares rather sympathetically at
Lila Mrs Chambers smiles nicely

SAM
We thought if you didnt mind wed

SHERIFF
Went out before service

MRS CHAMBERS

SAM
(To Sheriff not a
question)

curb

LILA
(Interrupting)

SHERIFF
Just what he told your detective

She used a fake name saw the register myself Saw the whole
place as a matter of fact That boy is alone there

SAM
No mother

SHERIFF
You mustve seen an illusion Sam
Now I know youre not the seeing-

MRS CHAMBERS

reporting at the house ‘round dinner

She smiles brightly as if having invited them over to discuss
this years charity fandango takes the

Sheriffs arm starts away The Sheriff nods as he goes
Sam and Lila are alone now at the curb before the deserted
chapel For a long moment they just stand there their faces

as gray and overcast as the sky

SAM
Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type

LILA
Youre not

Sam takes her arm starts walking her up the street toward
the spot where his pick-up truck is parked
CAMERA FOLLOWS them

SAM
Want me to drop you at the hotel
Or you want to come over to the store

Lila does not answer They reach the truck Lila looks
directly at Sam as he helps her into the cab

LILA

SAM
Neither will I

He slams the door hurries around truck gets into drivers
seat starts motor As the truck drives off

DISSOLVE TO
SAM AND LILA IN TRUCK - (PROCESS - HIGHWAY)

For a moment both are silent Sam watching the road as if
there were other cars on it Lila staring at nothing in
particular except perhaps her own inner fear

LILA
I wonder if well ever see Mary again

SAM
Of course we will

LILA
Alive

Sam looks as if hed like to say something humorous something
to cheer her He cannot He remains silent

LILA
We lived together all our lives

When we woke up one morning and found ourselves orphans
Mary quit college and got a job so I could go to college

SAM
Whered you go to college

LILA

I didnt I got a job too

(A pause)
I wonder if that hurt her my not
letting her sacrifice for me Some
people are so willing to suffer for
you that they suffer more if you
dont let them
SAM
(Almost to himself)
She was willing to lick the stamps

Lila looks quizzically at him is too concerned to pursue
it

LILA
I wonder so many things about her
now Why she never told me about
you Funny when you think theres
an answer to everything you think
you know all the answers

SAM
We were going to get married Are
going to get married

LILA
Do you know how I found out about
you I found one of your letters
it was a nice letter Sam

SAM
This is the old highway

LILA
I suppose when you were able to
marry her shed have presented you
all shiny and proper she always

tried to be proper

SAM
Watch your tenses

LILA
Huh

SAM
She always tries to be proper

Sam slows the truck to a stop sighs starts to light up a
cigarette Lila looks questioningly and impatiently at him

LILA

The place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep
gray of the cloudy sky We see Sams truck turning into the
driveway and pulling to a stop After a moment Sam and Lila
get out of the truck

FRESH ANGLE

Close on Sam and Lila as they meet on the porch side of the
truck The motel office and the house beyond can be seen in
bg of shot Sam and Lila merely stare for a moment then
turn and gaze up at the house There is no figure in the
window and the shade is drawn Same goes to the office door
peers in knocks opens door enters Lila remains on the
driveway beside the truck

CUT TO
INT THE MOTHERS ROOM - (DAY)

CLOSE ANGLE on Norman standing by the window He has pulled
the curtains very slightly apart is staring out and down at
the motel his eyes studying the lone figure of Lila who is
standing by the truck and looking up at the house Norman
studies her and as her eyes look up at this very window he
closes the curtains turns away

We see the suspicion and fear in his face the surge of panic
and his struggle to contain it Then he goes away CAMERA
remains on window shooting out and down and through the
frail curtains we can see Sam as he comes out of the motel
office and joins Lila

EXT MOTEL OFFICE - CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA

SAM
(Unconsciously
whispering)
I wonder where Norman Bates does his
hermiting

LILA
Someone was at that window I saw
the curtain move

Sam takes Lilas arm

Come on

He starts with her toward the path which leads to the old
house CAMERA PANS with them and as they turn around the
office corner they see Norman coming down the path toward
them They pause and Norman pauses He does not smile nor
speak His usual grin and soft friendliness are gone
containment and impassivity lie in their place

SAM
(Cheerfully)
Just coming up to ring for you

NORMAN
(Coming forward)
I suppose you want a cabin

SAM
Wed hoped to make it straight to
San Francisco but we dont like the
look of that sky Looks like a bad
day coming doesnt it

Norman walks past Sam giving him the sort of quick
disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying
goes onto the porch and into the office Sam and Lila follow
Norman

INT MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

Norman crosses to the desk goes behind it takes the key to
cabin number twelve off the keyboard Sam and Lila have
entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time

NORMAN
Ill take you to

SAM
Better sign in first hasnt we

Sam eyes scan the counter looking for a registration book

NORMAN
It isnt necessary

SAM
(Interrupting with a
friendly cheerfulness)
Uh uh My boss is paying for this
trip ninety percent business
and he wants practically notarized
receipts I better sign in and get a
receipt

Norman stares at Sam as if hed like to yell at him call
him liar Instead he reaches under the desk counter brings
out the registration book Lila moves closer studies the
book as Sam signs in Sam signs Joe and Mrs Johnson The
signature and city of Marie Samuels and after it the
notation Cabin One can be clearly seen three registrations
above Sams

When Sam has finished he closes book hands it back to Norman
Norman does not take it starts out from behind counter

NORMAN
Ill get your bags

SAM
Havent any

NORMAN
(after a stare)
Ill show you the cabin

As he starts for the door Sam laughs Norman stops turns
looks at him

SAM
First time Ive seen it happen
(to Lila)
Check in any place in this country
without bags and you have to pay in
advance

Sam smiles as if at a funny remark takes a bill out of his
pocket

NORMAN
Ten dollars

Norman returns to Sam takes the extended bill is about to
start out again

SAM
That receipt

Norman goes reluctantly behind counter lays down the key to
cabin twelve takes a receipt book out of the drawer under
counter starts to write Lila steps up to the desk picks
up the key quickly starts out

LILA
Ill start ahead
Norman looks up gazes her as she goes out door
EXT THE MOTEL - (DAY)

Lila comes along the porch pauses before cabin one tries
the door It opens She closes it quickly as she hears Sam
and Norman coming out of the motel office continues on down
the porch

SAM
(To Norman who is
following)
Dont bother yourself well find

it

He goes on down the porch doesnt even glance at cabin one
walks quickly and catches up to Lila just as she reaches
cabin twelve CAMERA REMAINS with Norman who is standing by
the office door looking after Sam and Lila his face alert
and no longer impassive He waits a moment after they have
closed their cabin door then crosses to the pickup truck
CAMERA MOVES with him He studies the truck then leans in
through the drivers window twists the registration card
around reads it

It gives the correct name and address of Sam Loomis

Norman comes back out of the window glances once more toward
cabin twelve then at the old house His suspicions are
confirmed and now there is the relaxation of relief in his
face He takes on a purposeful air turns strides up the
path up onto the porch of the house opens the door goes
in

INT CABIN TWELVE - (DAY)

Lila is at the cabins rear window looking out straining
for a glimpse of the old house which cannot be seen from
the window of this cabin

She turns frustrated anxious Sam is standing at the foot
of the bed staring at the smooth coverlet his brow creased
in a sadness

LILA
We should have asked for Cabin One
The one Mary was in

SAM
Im glad we didnt

He pulls his eyes from the bed crosses to the desk sits
wearily lights a cigarette Lila watches him for a moment
feels a real compassion goes to the bed sits on its edge
turns again and looks at Sams back

LILA
We have to go into that cabin and
search it Sam no matter what
were afraid of finding and no matter
how much it may hurt

SAM
I know
(A pause)
Do you think if something happened
it happened there

LILA

(A pause then)
Sam if you owned a useless business
like this motel one you probably
couldnt even sell what would
you need to get away to start a new
business somewhere else

(As Sam studies her)
Forty thousand dollars

SAM
How could we prove
(An almost hopeless

laugh)
Well if he opens a new motel on the
new highway say a year from now

LILA
There must be some proof that exists
right now Something that proves he
got that money away from Mary
Some way

SAM
What makes you sound so certain

LILA
Arbogast Sam he liked me or
felt sorry for me and he was
starting to feel the same about you
I heard it when he called in his
voice a caring He wouldnt have
gone anywhere or done anything without
telling us Unless he was stopped
And he was stopped so he must have
found out something

Sam considers a moment nods agreement rises

SAM
Well start with Cabin One

He goes to the door opens it slightly looks out then
back to Lila

SAM
If he sees us were just taking
the air

Lila goes to the door He holds it open and she goes out
EXT THE MOTEL - (DAY)
Sam closes the door joins Lila takes her hand

Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin
One CAMERA FOLLOWS They pause before the door of Cabin
One Sam motions Lila to wait to hold still then goes on
to the office opens the door calls in

SAM
Bates

He waits there is no response He goes in and in a moment
comes back out closes the door goes to Lila

She has already opened the door of Cabin One and has started
to enter

INT CABIN ONE - (DAY)
The blinds are closed and the room is almost night-dark
Sam comes in after Lila closes the door behind him

For a moment they just gaze at the room as if willing it to
tell them some satisfactory story

Neither speaks Then in dark silence they begin to search
going methodically and thoroughly through all drawers the
closet the desk searching under the bed and in dark corners
not knowing what they expect to find and yet expecting to
find some thing Lila opens the bathroom door looks in The
windowless room is very dark She switches on the light

goes in Sam moves toward the bathroom is about to follow
her in when he notices which room it is and automatically
catches himself up backs out

SAM
Sorry

LILA
Hospital clean

SAM
What

LILA

The bathroom Look at how clean it
is The one in our cabin is clean
but this is clean

Sam goes in glances around nods Lila goes through the
medicine cabinet finds nothing but a glass and two tiny
tabs of soap Sam leans against the door-jamb looks at the
tub the shower pipe above it He continues to stare more
interested suddenly as if bothered by some off-key evidence
he cant put his finger on Then he looks at the shower
curtain rod

And realizes there is no shower curtain He frowns is about
to say something when Lila who has been momentarily out of
shot interrupts

Sam turns CAMERA TURNS and we see Lila is standing above
the toilet bowl a tiny piece of wet paper stuck to the tip
of her right index finger

SAM
What is it

LILA
It didnt get washed down Its
figuring the kind you tear up and

get rid of
(Extending her finger
toward Sam)
Some figure has been added to or
subtracted from forty thousand

Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger studies it

takes out his wallet presses the wet scrap to his drivers
license shield puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet
away

LILA
Thats proof Mary was here It would
be too wild a coincidence for somebody
else to

SAM
(Reminding)
Bates never denied Mary was here

LILA
(Reminded)
Yes
(A thought)
But maybe this proves that Bates
found out about the money

SAM
Do we simply ask him where hes hidden
it

LILA

Sam that old woman whoever she is
I think she told Arbogast something
And I want her to tell us the same
thing
She starts out of the bathroom Sam takes hold of her arm
stops her

SAM
You cant go up there

LILA
Why not

Bates

CAMERA STARTS TO PAN AWAY from them moves slowly over the
room very slowly

LILAS VOICE (0S)
Lets find him One of us can keep
him occupied while the other gets to
the woman

SAMS VOICE (0S)
You wont be able to hold him still
if he doesnt want to be held And I
dont like you going into that house
alone Lila

CAMERA HAS PANNED clear across to the opposite wall now and
is moving up closer and closer to the tiny-flowered wall
paper finally closing in on one small rosebud

LILAS VOICE (0S)
I can handle a sick old woman

Now we see that the rosebud has been cut out that this is
the reverse side of the hole Norman peeped through to watch
Mary And we see the pupil of Normans eye now

SAMS VOICE (0S)
All right Ill find Bates and keep
him occupied

The eye moves away and there is a brief flash of light before
the hole is covered on the other side by the wall-hung
painting

FRESH ANGLE - LILA AND SAM

They are about to start out Sam stops her again

SAM
Wait a minute If you get anything
out of the mother
(A thought)
Can you find your way back to town
(As Lila nods yes)
If you do get anything dont stop
to tell me

Lila nods quickly hurries to the door Sam gets to it first
opens it a slight crack looks out then opens it wide enough
for Lila and Himself to pass through

EXT THE MOTEL - (DAY)

ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out turns to her

left goes along porch toward cabin twelve Sam remains at

the door then turns right heading for the path As he passes
the office he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside
the open door

NORMAN
Looking for me

SAM

(Recovering)
Yes matter of fact

(The friendly grin)
The wifes taking a nap and I can
never keep quiet enough for her
so I thought Id look you up and
talk

NORMAN
Satisfied with your cabin

SAM
Fine

Sam starts into the office Just before going in he glances
down the long porch sees Lila standing outside the door of
cabin twelve waves her a tiny all clear signal

LILA

CAMERA ANGLES to include Lila and her point of view

She watches Sam disappear into the office waits until she
hears the door close then looks about for another way to
reach the house She sees the small alley at the end of this
L of cabins starts toward it

listening Her eyes scan the layout the closed door which
leads off the hallway to the dining room on the right and
the parlor on the left Down at the end of the hall is the
kitchen the door wide open the room beyond dim and silent
She notices the stairs leading down to the basement stares
at them then back to the stairs leading to the second floor
She starts forward and seems about to investigate the parlor
and dining room

INT THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

Norman is behind the counter standing staring at Sam who
is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa Norman has the look of
one who is protecting himself as if the counter were a
protective wall against the threatening world across it

SAM
(Cheerfully as if
after a self-conscious
pause)
Ive been doing all the talking so
far havent I

NORMAN
Yes

SAM

I always thought it was the people
who are alone so much who do all the
talking when they get the chance
Yet there you are doing all the
listening

(A pause)
You are alone here arent you

(As Norman does not

reply)
It would drive me crazy

NORMAN
That would be a rather extreme
reaction wouldnt it

SAM
(Lightly)
Just an expression
(More seriously)

What I meant was Id do just about
anything to get away Wouldnt
you

INT DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY AND STAIRS OF OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

Lila is halfway up the stairs As she climbs she is startled
by the creaks and groans of the old wood of the steps She
steps more carefully CAMERA remains at foot of stair TILTING
UP as Lila climbs She pauses at the head of the stair The
door on her right which opens into the mothers room is
closed To her left is another door half-open Directly
before her is a third door closed She holds a long moment
trying to picture in her mind which room would look out on

the front of the house decides chooses the correct door

the one on her right She goes to it knocks lightly

INT THE MOTHERS ROOM (DAY) - CLOSE ANGLE ON DOOR
We hear Lilas second knock then faintly her soft call

LILAS VOICE (0S)
Mrs Bates
There is quiet for a moment then the door begins to open
and we see Lila She stands on the threshold looking in at
the room instantly disturbed by it almost chilled her
expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go
away from this room forever

After a moment she enters leaving the door open behind
her CAMERA PULLS BACK AND AWAY and we now see the room as
Lila sees it

It is ornate damask-and-mahogany thick and warm and ripe
an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric-a-brac of
the last century The bed is four poster but uncanoped the
dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin there is a
great chiffonier a big-doored wardrobe a large oval full-
length pier-glass (this against the wall directly opposite
the door) a satin recamier an upholstered armchair by the
window a white marble fireplace its grate cold but piled
with ashes

And there is in the room an unmistakably live quality as if
even though it is presently unoccupied it has not been long
vacated by some musty presence

Lila glances at the bed The damask coverlet is thrown over
it but it is not neat there is the imprint of a body on
it a body which obviously has slept in a curled-up womb-
like position Lila stares at it for a moment up then goes
to the dressing table Its top is scattered with boxes and
jars of cosmetics and creams traces of fresh powder an
opened bottle or perfume a comb and a brush with traces of
hair in its bristles Lila moves on catches a glimpse of
herself in the pier-glass is startled turns away goes to
the chiffonier is about to open a drawer sees the high
wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes goes to it
hesitantly She opens one door Fresh clean well pressed
dresses hang neatly Lila opens the other door The sweaters
and dresses and robes hang freely none in moth-proof storage-
type bags There is even a well-brushed collar of foxes
Along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean polished
shoes Lila stares then closes the door turns looks once
again over the whole room starts out

INT THE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

Lila comes out of the mothers room closes the door behind
her looks down the stairs then starts across the hall to
the room whose door is half-open The room within is dark
the shades drawn full

Lila pauses on the threshold reaches in feels the wall
throws on a switch

INT MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)

Sam has risen is standing by the counter now
SAM
Im not saying you shouldnt be
contented here Im just doubting
that you are I think if you saw a
chance to get out from under
youd unload this place

NORMAN
(Angrily)
This place This isnt a place
Its my only world I grew up in
that house back there I was a happy
child My mother and I we were
more than happy

SAM
And now that your mothers dead

Norman snaps a sharp fast ugly look at him

NORMAN
My mother is not dead

SAM
(Softly)
I didnt think so

INT NORMANS ROOM IN THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

Lila is standing in the doorway staring at the room in sick
dismay The room is grotesque a horrible ludicrous fantasy
of childhood held beyond the point of decency

It is a small room The walls are fancied with romping
silhouettes of teddy-bears and sailboats and carousels and
fat cows jumping over aghast moons The bed is small far

too short for a man of Normans height And yet the rumpled
covers indicate that it is in this bed that Norman sleeps
Next to the bed is an old-fashioned toy chest On its top
there are a bird-in-a-cage lamp a plain-bound book and an
ash tray filled with ashes and cigarette stubs A grown mans
shirt hangs on a childs clothes tree

Against one wall there is a narrow high bookcase filled

with thick unchildish-looking books On the small white
chest of drawers there is an old childs victrola The record
on the turntable is discovered on close inspection to be
Beethovens Eroica Symphony

Lila studies the room fascinated and repelled She glances
at the bookcase comes into the room goes to the bookcase
and pulls out a thick large plain-bound book She opens
it Her eyes go wide in shock And then there is disgust
She slams the book closed drops it

INT THE MOTEL OFFICE - (DAY)
Norman behind the counter has moved
Sam is still on the other side of the

back against the wall
counter but is leaning

forward his eyes hard on Normans face

Normans face is no longer expressionless It has the stark

high sheen of a cornered animal

SAM
(Pressing)

You look frightened Have I been

saying something frightening

NORMAN

I dont know what youve been saying

SAM

Ive been talking about your mother
about your motel How are you going

to do it

NORMAN
Do what

SAM
Buy a new one In a new town

Where you wont have to hide your

mother

NORMAN
Shut up

SAM
Where will you get the money to do
that Bates or do you already
have it socked away a lot of
it

NORMAN

Leave me alone

SAM
-Forty thousand dollars

NORMAN
Leave me alone

He is close to panic now He turns swiftly dashes back
into his private parlor Sam goes quickly around the counter

follows

INT NORMANS PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)

Norman hears Sam following wants to run to never be reached
by this man He crosses the small room drawn to the rear

window as if he might fly through it
Norman turns back against the window
as are the many still stuffed birds

Sam enters pauses
as unable to fly away
Sam registers a brief
flicker of reaction when he sees the birds but continues to
gaze at Norman hard

SAM
I bet your mother knows where the
money is And what you did to get
it And I think shell tell us

Something self-assured and confident in Sams tone gives
Norman a new more terrified alarm He turns his head glances
out the window at the old house He looks back at Sam and
there is terror in his voice

NORMAN
Wheres that girl The girl you came
with Where is she

Sam does not respond smiles a half-smile turns to examine
a stuffed owl Norman looks back at the house

NORMAN
(A horrible groan)
Oh God

INT UPSTAIRS HALL OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

Lila shaken and disturbed almost sickened is coming out
of Normans room She has left the light on She pauses in
the middle of the landing looks at the closed door opposite
the stairs goes to it opens it sees that it is the
bathroom pulls the door to turns starts toward the stairs

INT NORMANS PRIVATE PARLOR - (DAY)

Sam is lying on the floor face downward unmoving A
candlestick is on the floor close by his head still rocking
as if just dropped OVER SHOT comes the SOUND of Normans
footsteps and CAMERA TURNS in time to catch a brief glimpse
of him going out into the office almost at a run

INT STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

Lila is on the top step looking down toward CAMERA

She is listening hoping to hear some human sound some sound
she might follow pursue She hears nothing She starts down
the stairs Just below the halfway step she looks at the
front door sees out through the door window

LILAS VIEWPOINT - (DAY)

Norman coming

INT STAIRWAY OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

For a moment Lila panics then she hurries down the steps
cannot go in the direction of the front door remembers the
stairway behind her turns and runs in that direction The
SOUND of Norman bounding up the porch steps can be heard
Lila turns and dashes down the stairs which lead to the
basement going down far enough to conceal herself crouching
there

Norman enters the hallway closes the door softly listens
He glances once in the direction of the basement stairs He
seems about to smile when suddenly all expression vanishes
from his face and he appears to enter a no-place no-time
state He crosses to the stairway goes up

Lila remains crouched on the basement stairs listening to

the SOUNDS of Norman His footsteps on the stairs followed

by the fast noises of doors opening of fast moving about an
upstairs room Convinced that he is searching the upstairs

for her she decides to chance an escape She starts up the
steps is about to turn into the hallway when her eye is
caught by a glimmer of light down in the basement She pauses
looks down sees the crack of light coming from behind the

not entirely closed door to the fruit cellar The swift moving
SOUNDS of Norman continue to come from upstairs

Lila is torn knows she should get out of the house while
she has the chance is unable to resist the impulse to check
that hidden-looking room down below a room in which she
desperately believes there must lie some answer to what
happened to Mary She turns and goes softly and quickly down
the stairs

INT THE BASEMENT OF THE OLD HOUSE - (DAY)

Lila reaches the bottom stops listens hears the stairboards
creaking as footsteps fall hard and measured upon them She
turns pulls open the fruit cellar door looks in The woman
is sitting in a comfortable chair the back of the chair

and the woman turned to the door Lila calls a harsh
frightened whisper

LILA
Mrs Bates

Lila goes into the room
INT THE FRUIT CELLAR

Lila goes to the chair touches it The touch disturbs the
figure It starts to turn slowly stiffly a clock-wise
movement Lila looks at it in horror It is the body of a
woman long dead The skin is dry and pulled away from the
mouth and the teeth are revealed as in the skeletons smile
The eyes are gone from their sockets the bridge of the nose
has collapsed the hair is dry and wild the cheeks are
sunken the leathery-brown skin is powdered and rouged and
flaky The body is dressed in a high-neck clean well-pressed
dress obviously recently laundered and hand-ironed
The movement of this stuffed ill-preserved cadaver turning
as if in response to Lilas call and touch is actually
graceful ballet-like and the effect is terrible and obscene

Lila gazes for one flicker of a deathly moment then begins
to scream a high piercing dreadful scream

And Lilas scream is joined by another scream a more
dreadful horrifying scream which comes from the door behind
her

NORMANS VOICE (0S)
(screaming)
Ayeeeeeeeeeeceeeeeeeeeeee Am Norma
Bates

Lila turns
NORMAN

His face is contorted He wears a wild wig a mockery of a
womans hair He is dressed in a high-neck dress which is

similar to that worn by the corpse of his mother His hand
is raised high poised to strike at Lila There is a long

breadknife in it

LILA
Close on her face She is dumb-struck Her eyes are screaming
BACK TO NORMAN

As he is about to start forward a mans hand reaches in
from the doorway behind grabs Normans wrist Sam comes
through the door still holding tight to the wrist pulling
back the arm and at the same time throwing himself at Norman
football tackle style

SERIES OF CUTS - THE FIGHT
Norman and Sam struggling The wild fury in Normans face
the mad noise of his screams and vile curses The terrified
fight-to-the-death look of Sam The still staring Lila
MRS BATES
A close of her face She appears to be watching and enjoying
the fight Over the shot the SOUNDS of the struggle the
screams of Norman

DISSOLVE TO
EXT COURTHOUSE AT READING - (NIGHT)
There are many people gathered about the steps the curious

and the concerned and the morbid At the curb a couple of
newspaper cars two or three police cars and a mobile unit
truck from the local television outlet There is noise and
chattering as questions are asked and answers given and the
sounds of traffic and of the television equipment being
moved into the courthouse for on-the-scene reporting and
the stern voices of policemen trying to keep people back

The scene has a bright glare about it that quality of sudden
light thrown on a fearful darkness

CLOSER ANGLE ON STEPS OF COURTHOUSE

A POLICEMAN trying to make way for the television men
muttering keep back etc to the spectators A TELEVISION
MAN carrying a piece of equipment goes through door and
CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the courthouse vestibule

Here too there is a crowd composed of Policemen Reporters
Television Men The Television Men we have been following
stops beside a Policeman

TELEVISION MAN
(Indicating the front
door he has just
come in through)
You think theyll take him out that
way

POLICEMAN

(Looking at waiting

crowd shrugging)
Probably have to

(A rueful smile)
Besides the taxpayers hate it when
something gets slipped out the back
door on them

Over this exchange the buzz of other voices the movement
of men CAMERA MOVES ON down the corridor gets to the door
of the office of the Chief of Police just as a young fellow
with a carton box filled with paper containers of sent-out-
for coffee reaches this door CAMERA HOLDS as the COFFEE BOY
pauses a moment then goes into the room

CUT TO
INT OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE - (NIGHT)

Lila is seated in a chair Sam standing close by A bit apart
from them we see Sheriff Chambers in quiet conference with
the CHIEF OF POLICE the COUNTY SHERIFF the DISTRICT
ATTORNEY

The Coffee Boy stands in the doorway Sam goes to him takes
a container of coffee from the box carries it to Lila

checking the notation on the lid as he goes

MED CLOSE ON SAM AND LILA
SAM
(quietly)
Its regular Okay

LILA
(ruefully)
I could stand something regular

Sam smiles encouragingly hands her the coffee Sheriff
Chambers ENTERS SHOT gives Sam a container of coffee he has
brought for him Sam takes it nods a thank you

For a moment no one speaks Lila looks badly shaken Sam
disheveled but contained

CHAMBERS
You two can go on home if you like
(a sympathetic look
at Lila)
Making that statement was enough for
one night

SAM
(to Lila)
Want to
LILA
No Im all right Ill feel better
when all this is explained if it
can be

Sam looks a question at Sheriff Chambers Chambers shrugs
doubtfully

CHAMBERS
If anybody gets any answers itll
be the fellow talking to him now
the Psychiatrist Even I couldnt
reach Norman and he knows me
(to Lila)
You warm enough Miss

Lila is about to answer when she sees someone come into the
room and rises anxiously Sam and Sheriff Chambers turn
follow her gaze

INT OFFICE OF CHIEF OF POLICE - FULL SHOT

A young man with a serious frowning face has just come into
the room He is DR SIMON the Psychiatrist

He goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has
been placed takes up a container

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Did he talk to you
SIMON
No I got the whole story but not
from Norman I got it from his
mother

Everyone gazes at him mystified He speaks as he removes
lid from coffee container

SIMON
Norman Bates no longer exists He
only half-existed to begin with
now the other half has taken over
Probably for all time

LILA
(With difficulty)
Did he kill my sister

SIMON
Yes and no

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Look if youre trying to lay a lot
of psychiatric groundwork for some
sort of plea this fellow would like

to cop

SIMON
A psychiatrist doesnt lay the
groundwork he merely tries to
explain it

LILA

But my sister is

SIMON

Yes Im sorry

(to Chambers)
The Private Investigator too If
you drag that swamp somewhere in the
vicinity of the motel

(To the Chief of Police)
Have you any unsolved missing persons
cases on your books

CHIEF OF POLICE
Yes Two

SIMON
Young girls

CHIEF OF POLICE
(nods astounded
then)
Did he confess to

SIMON
(interrupting)
As I said the mother

(Pauses goes on afresh)
To understand it as I understood it
hearing it from the mother That
is from the mother-half of Normans
mind you have to go back ten years
to the time when Norman murdered his
mother and her lover

(A pause then as no

one interrupts)
He was already dangerously disturbed
had been ever since his father died
His mother was a clinging demanding
woman and for years the two of
them lived as if there was no one
else in the world Then she met a
man and it seemed to Norman she threw
him over for this man That pushed
him over the thin line and he
killed them both Matricide is
probably the most unbearable crime
of all and most unbearable to the
son who commit it So he had to erase
the crime at least in his own mind

(A pause)
He stole her corpse and a weighted
coffin was buried He hid the body
in the fruit cellar even treated
it to keep it as well as it would
keep And that still wasnt enough
She was there but she was a corpse
So he began to think and speak for
her gave her half his life so to
speak At times he could be both
personalities carry on
conversations at other times the
mother-half took over completely He
was never all Norman but he was
often only mother And because he
was so pathologically jealous of
her he assumed she was as jealous
of him Therefore if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman the
mother side of him would go wild

(To Lila)
When Norman met your sister he was
touched by her and aroused by
her He wanted her And this set off
his jealous mother and mother
killed the girl After the murder
Norman returned as if from a deep
sleep and like a dutiful son
covered up all traces of the crime
he was convinced his mother had
committed

SAM
Why was he dressed like that

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Hes a transvestite

SIMON

Not exactly A man who dresses in
womans clothing in order to achieve
a sexual change or satisfaction
is a transvestite But in Normans
case he was simply doing everything
possible to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive And
whenever reality came too close
en danger or desire threatened
at illusion hed dress up even
o a cheap wig he brought and hed
alk about the house sit in her
air speak in her voice He tried
o be his mother
(A sad smile)
And now he is

(A pause)
Thats what I meant when I said I
got the story from the mother She
thinks Norman has been taken away
because of his crimes She insists

taeaete

all the murders just to keep her

from being discovered She even smiled

a bit coquettishly as she said that
Of course she feels badly about
it but also somewhat relieved to
be as she put it free of Norman
at last

(A pause)
When the mind houses two
personalities there is always a
battle In Normans case the battle
is over and the dominant
personality has won

she did nothing that Norman committed

Lila begins to weep softly for Mary for Arbogast for
for all the destroyed human beings of this world
Sam bends beside her puts his arm about her

Norman

A POLICE GUARD puts his head in the door

CHAMBERS
(To Simon)
And the forty thousand dollars Who
got that

SIMON
The swamp These were murders of
passion not profit

comforts her

speaks in a near-
whisper to the Chief of Police The Guard is carrying a
folded blanket over his arm

POLICE GUARD
He feels a little chill can I
bring him this blanket

The Chief of Police nods The Guard goes away and CAMERA
FOLLOWS him out of the room and out into the hallway Guard
moves through the waiting men heading down the corridor

CUT TO
INT ANOTHER CORRIDOR IN COURTHOUSE

A narrower corridor in the rear of the building In fg of
shot we see a door the top half of which is wire-covered
glass A GUARD in uniform is posted by the door looking
reprovingly at the two or three people trying to get a glance
into the room

e Police Guard carrying the blanket comes down this
corridor goes to the door CAMERA MOVES CLOSE The uniformed
Guard opens the door allows the man to go in

Shot is RAKED so that we can not see into the room

After a moment the Guard comes out and the uniformed Guard
closes and locks the door and we

CUT TO
INT NORMANS DETENTION ROOM - (NIGHT)
The walls are white and plain There is no window

There is no furniture except the straight-back chair in which
Norman sits in the center of the room The room has a quality
of no-whereness of calm separation from the world

The Police Guard has placed the blanket on Normans knees
Norman as we come upon him is lifting the blanket unfolding
it His face although without makeup and without the
surrounding softness of the wig has a certain femininity
about it a softness about the mouth and a kind of arch
womanliness about the brows

Calmly Norman places the blanket about his shoulders as if
it were a cashmere shawl CAMERA REMAINS in a position so
that our view of Norman is a FULL ONE When the shawl is in
position and Norman is settled we HEAR OVER SHOT the
voice of his mother coming from the calm of his thoughts

MOTHERS VOICE (0S)
Its sad when a mother has to
speak the words that condemn her own
son but I couldnt allow them to
believe that I would commit murder

(A pause)
Theyll put him away now as I
should have years ago He was
always bad And in the end he
intended to tell them I killed those
girls and that man As if I could
do anything except just sit and
stare like one of his stuffed
birds

(A pause)

Well they know I cant even move a
finger And I wont Ill just sit
here and be quiet Just in case they
do suspect me

A fly buzzes close and then continues buzzing and flying
about Normans face

MOTHERS VOICE (VO)

Theyre probably watching me Well
let them Let them see what kind of
a person I am

(A pause as the fly

lights on Normans

hand)
Im not going to swat that fly I
hope they are watching Theyll see
theyll see and theyll know
and theyll say why she wouldnt
even harm a fly

Norman continues to gaze ahead into nothing

SCENE BEGINS TO DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO
THE SWAMP
As END TITLES FADE IN we see the swamp the chain of a tow-
truck The chain is attached to Marys car The car is coming
out of the swamp

FADE OUT

THE END
