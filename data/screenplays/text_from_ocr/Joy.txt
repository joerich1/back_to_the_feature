lst Studio Draft
May 17 2013
Close on A WOMAN’S FACE All we hear is her breathing as she
stares straight into BRIGHT LIGHTS paralyzed with fear
After a moment we hear a man speaking through a radio

VOICE FROM RADIO
Joy that’s you

Nothing

VOICE FROM RADIO (CONT’D)
Joy go ahead Joy

Her eyes look around blankly After a moment--

VOICE FROM RADIO (CONT’D)
We gotta get her outta there

off this we FLASHBACK TO--

SUPER LONG ISLAND 1982

INT ST DOMINIC’S CHURCH HALL

An ITALIAN-AMERICAN WEDDING RECEPTION is in full swing A 98
year old man plays the accordion and sings “Papa loves mambo”
with a lot of energy People are dancing having a ball
There is a long table with a FEAST of FOOD set up buffet
style OLD WOMEN talking KIDS running around

ANGLE ON JOY 30 a CHEERFUL BRIDE who stands at a table
in her wedding dress talking EXCITEDLY to the guests holding
a NAPKIN THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER IN ONE SHOT AS SHE MOVES
THROUGH THE ROOM A’LA GOODFELLAS

JOY
(playful)
Ooh I don’t know where my husband
is I’ve already lost him and weve
only been married twenty minutes

Joys BEST FRIEND RONNIE 30 a SASSY ITALIAN BETTE MIDLER
approaches She holds a plate and eats while she follows
Joy

RONNIE
Tony’s eating I made you a plate
It’s at the table Let’s go

JOY
I’m coming
(to guests)
How’s the ziti though guys
Rosati’s did everything Is it

RONNIE
Joy Come on

Joy heads off Ronnie behind her She runs into an older
FEMALE RELATIVE

OLDER WOMAN GUEST
Joy congratulations I just had my
uterus out I’m not even
supposed to be here but I don’t
listen to doctors

JOY
Oh--Auntie Olga I’m so grateful
that you came Go sit Did you get
a plate I’m gonna make you a
plate

RONNIE
Joy

Joy and Ronnie move through crowd passing JOY’S MOTHER
TOOTS 60-ish who stands by herself As she talks to her
mother Joy squats down uses the NAPKIN in her hand to help
a little girl get a stain out of her dress

JOY
Here you go Marie Mom you’re
still standing here Why don’t you
sit

TOOTS
Did you notice your father spray-
painted his bald spot Who does he
think he’s fooling He’s not
fooling her

They both glance over to a table where Joy’s father RUDY sits
like a KING with his arm around a ROBUST woman in an ill-
fitting MARILYN MONROE DRESS His hair looks shiny

JOY
Mom let it go Just for today

Toots walks off muttering to herself
TOOTS

He’s glossy He looks like a
children’s toy

This is Joy--everything to everyone

JOY
Club soda See All gone

LITTLE GIRL
Thank you
The little girl runs off Joy stands up next to Ronnie She
brushes her dress off takes it all in

JOY
Wow Best day of my life It
happened

Ronnie notices a GROUP OF MEN that has congregated in one
spot They watch a WOMAN WITH HUGE BREASTS walk by They ogle
and cat call to the woman amused by themselves The woman
knows they are watching her she keeps walking insecure

RONNIE
Look at these animals You think
they’ve never seen a set of boobs
in their life We’re married to
these people Good luck we just
got shot down the hatch That’s it
End of story We’re in it

Suddenly a VOICE comes over the loud speaker

VOICE This song is dedicated to my bride

Joy and Ronnie look to the stage Joy’s husband TONY
MANGANO has the microphone He is 1980’s GORGEOUS Thick
curly brown hair dimples There is something about this guy
He meets eyes with Joy

JOY
Come on they’re not all bad

RONNIE
Joy even the best dog is two meals
away from bein’ a wolf

TONY
This is a song that says it better
than I could From the lyrical
genius Baby here’s a little Tom
Jones for ya

The lights GO OUT A DISCO BALL turns on and paints the room
with lights A SPOTLIGHT comes up on Tony who now has his
jacket off his sleeves rolled up and his back to the crowd
in a DRAMATIC pose Las Vegas has just shown up to the party
The band begins playing The crowd goes WILD

Tony TURNS AROUND His SHIRT is UNBUTTONED down to his belly
button and his HAIRY CHEST on display He is SERIOUS He
plays to the crowd This isn’t the first time he’s done
this
TONY (CONTD)
With these handsI will cling to
youIm yours forever and a
day

He JUMPS OFF THE STAGE onto the DANCE FLOOR lands and spins
effortlessly Everyone cheers He starts making his way over
to Joy

RONNIE
Uh-oh he’s comin this way He’s
comin’ over

TONY
With these hands I will bring to
you a tender love as warm as
May

He turns his backside to the crowd and circles his hips
Women cheer Ronnie puts her hand up to shield them from her
view Joy laughs blushing Tony signals the LARGE-BREASTED
WOMAN that the group of men was ogling

TONY (CONTD)
Who wants to dance Come here
sweetheart

The woman shyly comes toward him He twirls her around and
dips her with one hand Joy rolls her eyes and laughs

TONY (CONT’D)

With this heart I will sing to
you long after stars have lost
their glow

(the woman keeps looking

at another woman in the

crowd)
Who’s that Is that your sister

(The woman nods)
I’ve never danced with two sisters
before

Tony pulls the sister up and dances with them both one on
each arm

TONY (CONTD)
And with these hands I will provide
for you

He spins them both out and back in They all sway back and
forth sensually The woman next to Joy is uncomfortable Joy
fakes being mad pointing her finger at him playfully

TONY (CONTD)
Should there be a stormy sea Ill
turn the tide for you

They pivot and we see that one of the women’s hands has made
its way to Tony’s ass Just as Joy becomes slightly visibly
uncomfortable Tony spins the women back into the crowd

TONY (CONT’D)
Ho It’s my wedding day Where’s my
wife

He searches the room Locating Joy he turns ALL of his
attention on her

TONY (CONTD)
There she is Come here baby
Isn’t she beautiful everyone

Joy blushes shaking her head

TONY (CONTD)
She’s more beautiful than Crystal
Gayle

The crowd ahhs This wins Joy over He pulls her up and
dances closely with her as he BELTS IT OUT in her face--

TONY (CONTD)
NOOOO Ill never No Ill never
LET YOU GO

They kiss There is a dance break in the song They dance

TONY (CONTD)
Well whattaya think You still
wanna be Mrs Tony Mangano You
haven’t changed your mind yet

JOY
I don’t know I guess I will under
one condition

TONY
What’s that

JOY
You have to sing that song to me
every day for the rest of my life

TONY
You got it baby

Tony gets infused with energy
TONY (CONT’D)
Oooohooohhhh And Ill never NO
Tll never

He spins Joy and continues singing
The song continues over card 7 YEARS LATER

INT JOY AND TONY’S HOUSE MORNING

Very humble BLUE COLLAR SUBURBAN home Some DEAD BUSHES in
the front A DECORATIVE GRAPEVINE WREATH on the front door
warms the look of the place

TONY (0S)
“ Long after stars have lost their
glow

Tonys voice still belting only now it’s from the shower as
Joy is in the kitchen preparing breakfast for their THREE
KIDS--CHRISTIE 7 BOBBY 6 AND JACKIE 4 They are engaged in
LIVELY morning chatter

Suddenly smoke starts pouring out of the toaster

JOY (CONTD)
Oh no

CHRISTIEJACKIE

Joy starts to fan the smoke trying to stay cheery
JOY
(staying cheery)
This toaster likes to burn

She studies the inside of the toaster TONY enters in his
towel He’s all man

TONY

out a piece of STEAK from a TUPPERWARE container

Joy takes FOIL out of a drawer

TONY
(taking a bite)
Baby where’s my interview suit

JOY
I got it pressed It’s in the
closet in the plastic

Joy tears off just the right size of foil She slides the
foil in the toaster next to the toast so that the hot rods do
not overcook the bread

TONY
Daddy’s got a big interview today
Gonna get in the potato chip
business If things go well start
thinking about an above ground
swimming pool that’s all I’m
sayin

Joy puts three pieces of toast back in

KIDS

Joy watches the toast Adjusts the foil Tony looks at her

TONY

JOY

JOY
(alarmed but trying to
keep it light)
We don’t have the money for a new
toaster I can fix it

TONY

JOY
It’s not that big of a deal Please

pay the electric bill

TONY

(plays to the kids)

JOY

Joy shakes her head laughing

CHRISTIE

Three perfectly toasted pieces of bread pop out of the
toaster

INT JOY AND TONY’S HOUSE LATER THAT MORNING

Joy mops her kitchen floor The mop pushes around the food
and dirt rather than picking it up She grabs a paper towel
gets down on her hands and knees and cleans the floor with a
paper towel

She makes beds

INT BASEMENT CONTINUOUS

It looks like an UNDERGROUND FLORIST down here There are
tables set up with BASKETS on them full of different items--
SILK FLOWERS and LEAVES sticks bunches of fake berries
ribbon pine cones and pruning shears Everything is very
neat and organized

We see various shots of Joy grabbing from the different
baskets and glueing LEAVES BERRIES FLOWERS MINI-PINE
CONES She takes a RIBBON and ties it at the top then holds
it up to check her work It is a VERY PRETTY DECORATIVE
GRAPEVINE WREATH She sets it aside and grabs more twigs

BIKINIS on motorcycles washing cars bending over in a g-
string over the hood of a car etc

Joy stands with her father RUDY a small-framed man while
the KIDS PLAY in the background Behind them through a
window we see TWO GOOMBAHS sit playing cards

JOY
Something’s rubbing up against the
tire Tony wants you to look at it

RUDY
Yeah of course But first there’s
someone I want you to meet
(yells outside)
Viv

VIV A mid-60’s CHUBBY JOVIAL WOMAN enters Her body is out
of proportion--very round in the middle with skinny bird
legs She’s doing her best to look professional but she’s
busting out of the top and the sides

RUDY (CONTD)
Joy this is Viv She’s my new
office manager and uhwe’re
together She’s a model

Joy’s been through this before

JOY
Right Wow Hi it’s nice to meet
you

VIV

Hi Joy I’ve heard so much about
you I’d love to have you all over
sometime and cook for you in my
apartment

JOY
Oh Umyeah Sure

One is wearing a very nice suit This is MATTY THE HORSE

The goombahs playing cards get up and greet the two men Rudy
sees Matty

RUDY

about the car

VIV
My children are all grown up They
don’t talk to me anymore I don’t
know why

JOY
Oh that’s too bad I’m sorry

Joy sees Rudy nod agreeably at Matty

VIV
They blame me for a lot I guess
Kids love to blame their parents
And maybe something happened with
my third husband

Rudy and Matty step back and talk while the goombahs TAKE THE
PLATES off of the car

VIV (CONTD)
He was Australian He was just
culturally different And I think
he might have taken money from
them From their bank accounts

JOY
Oh wow Yeah maybe that’s what it
is

Rudy and Matty shake hands Joy makes out what Matty says

MATTY
Okay then Have a wonderful
Tuesday

RUDY

When I was a kid I always knew
about the women in my dad’s life I
could hear my parents arguing about

call the house My mom would cry in
the bathroom But I remember this
one day one of’em came to the
door and I was right there in the
dining room and she told my mom
she’d been with my dad But she
felt bad cause she didn’t know he
was married and she thought my mom
deserved to know And when she
was leaving she looked at my mom
kinda confused and she said “Im
surprised he runs around You look
like a wonderful lady” And my
momshe just went upstairs and
went to bed and she never really
came out I’m 6 years old making
dinner for my brother

uses her bare hands and tries to wring the mop out but
something unidentified and disgusting comes off on her hands
Frustrated she tries the wringer again It won’t budge She
jerks it again hard the winch BREAKS Joy slips takes a
HARD VIOLENT FALL onto the floor

the rollers down and wrings it out

Joy demonstrates proudly She pushes the LEVER down The mop

MALE HOST (CONTD)
How many times have you been in the
garage you know up to your elbows
in the grease and grime You’re
changing the oil building a deck
doing household projects and all
of sudden things get real messy
Youve got anti-freeze mud or
some sort of dirty fluid all over
the garage Now what

RONNIE
What the hell is this guy talking
about

MALE HOST

You need to mop And I hate
mopping Everybody hates mopping
Mopping is boring am I right
Well here’s the thing if you HAVE
TO mop this is your guy right
here The Miracle Mop

The HOST puts the mop in a bucket of DIRTY WATER making the
mop dirty and then applies the dirty water to the floor He
starts to get flustered

MALE HOST (CONTD)
All you do is push sorry you pull
this part here and you twist it

The HOST has no idea how to use the mop He vamps

MALE HOST (CONTD)
Then see how this part wrings the
water out Okay now the thing
about this thing is that this part
comes on and off

He searches for the switch near the mop head

MALE HOST (CONTD)
There’s a lever under here that you
just pull and this mop head pops
right off Or is it a button
Something’s tangled I know this is
supposed to be a button does this
eject Haha Oh Here we go

He’s lost

MALE HOST (CONTD)
Look at the way this works in the
water A real miracle Folks

VALERIE
It’s not my decision The sales
determine the fate of the product
and this product as you could see

WALT
Last night Joy’s mop sold twelve
units in the HI slot

DOUG BRIGGS
Oh Miss Mangano I see this all
the time You have a brand new
product and you think everyone is
gonna buy it Sometimes reality
doesn’t match our dreams

JOY
Let me ask you a question Would
you use a toaster to open a can
Would you use a fork to paint a
wall No you wouldn’t That joker
you had out there last night was
trying to sell my household mop as
a garage tool to men People aren’t
gonna buy something if they don’t
know what it’s for

DOUG BRIGGS
We did the demo the way we saw fit

Another man leans to the guy next to him

JERRY
(under his breath)
It’s always the demo huh Never
the product

Joy barrels forward

JOY
There’s nothing wrong with this
product This product--my FIVE year
old could use it That’s the whole
reason I made it This mop is
SIMPLE

WALT
Okay Joy well thanks a lot for
that we are gonna get back to work-

JOY
(to Doug)
Do you pee standing up

DOUG BRIGGS
Excuse me

JOY
Do you pee standing up

DOUG BRIGGS
UhhYes

JOY
Have you ever mopped around the
toilet
(turns to the table)
When was the last time any of you
mopped your bathroom floor
(nothing)
Well let me tell you how it works
The floor is covered in urine It
collects in a big halo around the
toilet And there’s other stuff on
the floor too Its disgusting So
your wife mops it up She dunks her
mop in the urine-water takes the
same mop into the kitchen and mops
that floor where your babies crawl
on their hands and knees and drop
their pacifier and then they stick
that pacifier back in their mouths
While this is happening your wife
is trying to wring the thing out
chapping her hands breaking her
back and eventually getting down on
her hands and knees to finish the
job that the mop can’t do She
spends most of her day this way
getting up and down on and off of
the floor And then you come home
after your busy day at the office
and your long commute home and you
wonder why you don’t get laid

The men are all quiet

WALT
Alright Well thank you Miss
Mangano we’re right in the middle
of--

DOUG BRIGGS
Hang on
(thinks )
Jerry do we have time on Wednesday

JERRY

of the house

DOUG BRIGGS
(laughing)
Get out of here

was fourteen and these animals
used to come in from getting hit by
cars out on the highway so I made
this glow in the dark dog collar

DOUG BRIGGS
(amused)
Really

JOY
Yeah I actually sent it to Hartz
and they never got back to me

DOUG BRIGGS
Wait didn’t they--

JOY
Yeah They came out with the same
one like a year later And then I
made this one-man-band thing where
I duct-taped a bunch of instruments
together--

INT RUDY’S AUTOBODY SHOP
Joy sits across from Rudy at his desk

RUDY
Avalon wants to go up to six
dollars per mop

JOY
What Why

RUDY
They feel that now that the
volume’s increased they wanna up
their price

JOY

That doesn’t make sense The cost
per mop should be less with a
bigger order

RUDY
That’s not the way they’re doing
it

JOY

What They can’t We can’t do that
I can’t make a profit that way I’m
out of business that way I can’t
afford to sell them At that price
I lose money on every mop I sell

RUDY
Well you’re gonna have to cut back
somewhere else

JOY
Cut back There’s nowhere to cut
We need to talk to them

RUDY
I did These guys are not gonna
budge on this This is what it is

JOY
Well they can’t do that This isn’t
right

RUDY
This is business Believe me I
know how this works This is how
this works Joy

JOY
Well then I wanna talk to them
Where’s the contract

RUDY
Contract There’s no contract

Joy freezes
JOY

contract with these people

RUDY
I told ‘em what we needed They
made it Now they wanna change the
price

JOY
That’s why you need a contract

RUDY
Joy Ive worked with these guys a
long time They run a good
business but you know they got
expenses too

JOY
What Their expenses What about
us What about our business I have
two weeks to produce 30000 mops
They’re putting this whole thing in
jeopardy We have to take the molds
somewhere else We’1ll get bids

RUDY
Sweetheart You’re talking to a 30
year entrepreneur on this It’s not
that easy And you don’t wanna get
caught up bickering over six bucks
when you got a big order hangin’
over your head Let’s just get the
mops made We’1ll worry about it on
the next order

INT JOY’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM

Joy sits with Ronnie Kids play in background

JOY

mean it’s his generation For
cryin’ out loud look at our
families They used to trade carpet
cleaning for a salami at the deli
and then trade that for a set of
white walls I don’t mean any
disrespect but you’ve come this
far And now you can’t move forward
because hehe blew it

Joy thinks about this

knew it So Evan Reynolds is a
crook

JOHN CALCAGNY
Evan Reynolds doesn’t exist

Joy tilts her head

JOY
OkayThen who’s been cashing my

JOHN CALCAGNY
Avalon and a couple other
companies on the west coast are
shell corporations owned by Matty
Aianello You know he’s--

Joys looks like she seen a ghost

JOY
Matty the Horse

JOHN CALCAGNY

They take the proceeds from
bookmaking loansharking drugs
and launder it--

JOY
I know what they do

JOHN CALCAGNY

So that being said Avalon is not
just the sole manufacturer on your
mop I just found out they own the
patent for the mop

JOY
We own the patent We filed the
paperwork

JOHN CALCAGNY
No you don’t Who hooked you up
with Avalon
INT RUDY’S AUTOBODY SHOP

STORMS into the garage

JOY

You gave my patent to the mob
RUDY

Wha-II--
JOY

The business is gone It’s gone

RUDY
You’re delusional Nothing’s gone
Why don’t you calm down You don’t
know anything about what you think

JOY
I don’t know anything I know you
lied to me I know you stole from
me You sold me out You gave it
all to the mob Matty Aianello owns
my business What am I missing Is

Beat He starts to explain

Joy nods

RUDY
I owed them money okay I thought
I could hand the patent over then
buy it back once things got going

“Of course”

JOY
So you used me You took everything
I worked for and gave it away like
it was nothing

RUDY
I didn’t know it was gonna turn
into a big deal okay It’s a mop I
didn’t think it was gonna go this
far

JOY
Great dad Another vote of
confidence

RUDY
Hey You needed help I got you the
molds If it wasn’t for me you
wouldn’t have a business right now

JOY
Without the patent there IS no
business

RUDY
The patent is just a piece of
paper Joy You don’t understand

JOY
Stop telling me I don’t understand
YOU don’t understand You know so
much about how business works
Youre the big entrepreneur Hows
that worked out for you dad Your
bus company went under The weight
loss program lasted four months
And the shop I don’t even know how
you stay afloat

RUDY
Because of the relationships that
I’ve spent 30 years building

JOY
You’re nowhere because of them

RUDY
You know not everyone gets lucky
the first time out the gate Not
everybody gets the breaks you’ve
had Joy

JOY
This has nothing to do with luck
I worked hard dad And I hoped
this would work out I hoped my
dreams and your dreams would go
together on this But you’re only
in it for yourself My whole life
youve been looking for the better
situation You did it to mom you
did it to us And you’re still
doin’ it You wanna be the big man
You want the big shot car the valet
parks up front You want to be one
of them But you know what You’re
not one of them You’re a stiff
You’re a mope And you know what
those mob guys think of you They
think your a sucker A poor
businessman always with his hand
out

RUDY
What about you You’re so god-
damn bull-headed you don’t take
the time to think anything through
I told you not to go out there
But you you gotta go out there
Cause you’re so much smarter than
everybody else You know it ALL
You did the same thing with Tony
No wonder he was looking for a way
out

This hangs in the air Joy is devastated After a beat--

JOY

Rudy says nothing Joy turns and walks away

INT MAC DONALDS

TOOTS
I’ve been so worried about you and
the kids and how your father could

Joy and the kids enter Bobby flips the tv on Joy looks a
little off She walks out of the room

INT JOY’S BEDROOM CONTINUOUS

Joy lays down on the bed in her clothes and conks out

DISSOLVE TO

INT JOY’S BEDROOM

It’s dark the shades are drawn There is no way to know what
time it is Joy is asleep She hears the door squeak open and
hears Jackie’s voice at the door A beam of light hits Joy’s
face

CHRISTIE (OS)
Jackie leave her alone

JACKIE (0S)
Why is she sleeping again

CHRISTIE (0S)
She’s tired Leave her alone

JACKIE (0S)
(sadly)
Mommy
The door CLOSES The conversation has roused Joy She stirs
then sits up She looks around the room It’s messy

INT JOY’S HOUSE STAIRWELL CONTINUOUS DAY

Joy comes down the stairs As she walks we see that some
TIME HAS PASSED The house is a mess

There are little piles of clothes all over the place Half-
folded piles of laundry Take-out food containers An old tv
dinner sits on the living room table Tv is on downstairs
She hears Christie in the kitchen arguing with Jackie and
Bobby She can’t make out what they’re saying

INT KITCHEN CONTINUOUS

Joy enters The kids sit at the kitchen table in their
designated spots eating

CHRISTIE
Because I said so I’m the oldest
and I said so

BOBBY
Hi mom
JOY
Hi What’s going on
BOBBY
Christie made dinner and we don’t
like it
CHRISTIE

They won’t even try it Everybody

I ask

JOY
Oh What is it

CHRISTIE
Pickles on crackers We’re out of
bread so the crackers is the bread
group And the pickles are the
vegetable group

It’s all on the table And there are TOY TEA CUPS

CHRISTIE (CONTD)
I couldn’t reach the cups

(turns to kids mom-like)
Jackie that’s not a real bite You
know the rules No dinner no
dessert

Joy looks at Jackie Her hair is matted Christie stands
with her APRON on looking like a woman in charge Bobby’s
SHIRT is on INSIDE OUT with the TAG in the front The
kitchen like the rest of the house a mess This picture a
snapshot from Joy’s childhood is all too familiar She
takes it in Just then they hear the front door open

Looks like things are gettin’ a
little crazy I think we gotta

JOY
(breaks down)

I don’t want to figure any more
things out I’m tired I can’t do
it anymore Everything I care
about they rip it apart That’s
what they do I just can’t fight
against it anymore

(MORE)
JOY (CONTD)
I wish I could stop feeling this
way but I’m done I’m worn out

TONY
Joy Youll find a way to fix this

JOY
No There’s no way to fix this one
If I fulfill the order I owe
money and lose my company If I
don’t fulfill the order I lose my
company and my reputation or I go
up against the mob And we all know
how that ends

Beat After a moment--

TONY
You know that night When you
kicked me out--

JOY
Tony I don’t wanna--

TONY
Just wait That was enough for you
That was the end of it You made
the decision even though you had no
back up And then you went and did
this great thing which we both
know never would have happened
otherwise

Joy looks up at Tony

TONY (CONTD)
You take your best shots when
youre down Of all of the options
here there’s only one that isn’t a
guarantee of losing everything And
as far as the mob goes they’re
animals But you’ve survived much
worse than anything they could do

JOY
What

TONY
Your folks

Joy cracks a smile “very funny”

TONY (CONTD)
I’m serious You deal with Toots
every day She’s a hundred times
worse than the mob

TONY (CONTD)

Joy you don’t see it but
everything you’ve already done is
harder Youve taken care of
everybody These kids These kids
are great You did that You worked
all these jobs and then you built
this mop and you made something of
yourself

(beat)
Youve never been a quitter You’re
gonna find a way I know I
wouldn’t try and get in your way
Between you and the mob my
money’s on you

Joy sits there

night You get some more rest

INT JOHN CALCAGNY’S OFFICE

JOHN CALCAGNY
When is the deadline

JOY
Ten days

John thinks

JOHN CALCAGNY
Well there’s only one option that
can get the molds back in time to
fulfill the HSN order

JOY
Okay What

JOHN CALCAGNY
We file an emergency request for a
temporary restraining order It’s
not the kind of restraining order
you hear about in domestic cases
This TRO is filed when there is an
emergency need for something to
happen immediately For example to
prevent the demolition of a
building or to stop a sale of a
company from happening It’s
specifically used for urgent and
timely cases like yours

JOY
Okay

JOHN CALCAGNY
We file saying we need to be heard
tomorrow The court will grant us a
hearing within two days then we go
in and present our evidence It’s
not a formal trial the whole case
is heard in one day But we do go
in front of the judge And he
summons the Avalon guys in We have
to prove that not only are we in
the right but that if the court
doesn’t step in now grant us an
injunction and get the molds back
immediately it will be a massive
loss One you can never recover
from

JOY
That’s us That’s me

JOHN CALCAGNY
Yeah but hold on

John looks distressed

JOY
What’s wrong

JOHN CALCAGNY
The courts don’t like these cases

JOY
Why

JOHN CALCAGNY
Judges want cases to go forward in
a traditional fashion to play
themselves out They stand by the
system that’s in place no risk or
appeal They feel a TRO is asking
for special treatment They feel if
the system is good enough for
everybody else it should be good
enough for you TRO cases are
virtually impossible to win This
is a one shot deal A Hail Mary
pass If you win you have a chance
of victory going forward If you
loseit’s over

Joy has a determined look in her eyes

JOHN CALCAGNY (CONTD)
Not to mention we’re going up
against the mob

JUDGE (CONTD)
Were hear today because plaintiff
Joy Mangano is moving for emergency
release of an affirmative
injunction forcing defendant
Matthew Aianello to relinquish
certain manufacturing molding
equipment related to the production
of a mop Counselor you may make
your argument

s up Joy is extremely nervous

JOHN CALCAGNY
Thank you Joy Mangano is the
inventor of the Miracle Mop She
created the product on her own
(MORE)

JOHN CALCAGNY (CONTD)
Early on she sought the assistance
of her father in production of
certain molds that are fundamental
in the manufacturing process
Unbeknownst to her her father
made a deal with Mr Aianello to
produce the molds As production
increased Mr Aianello made
unreasonable cost demands that made
production and distribution of said
mop impossible This effort at
conversion by the Defendant has
been catastrophic for Ms
Mangano’s business for herself
and for her children We are asking
the court to grant Ms Mangano
possession of her manufacturing
molds in order for her to fill a
very large order made by the Home
Shopping Network If the court does
not grant this tens of thousands
of orders will go un-filled and
Ms Mangano’s business and
reputation will be destroyed We
have sufficient evidence to support
our claim

MATTY’S LAWYER
Well having seen the video I’11

take two

There is laughter from the courtroom Even the Judge laughs
Joy looks worried

MATTY’S LAWYER (CONT’D)
Unfortunately the only thing this
video proves is that this woman can
sell mops And none of the other
evidence is binding with relation
to legal ownership of the mop Your
honor our client owns the patent
for this mop Its all here in plain
black and white

He presents the PATENT to the judge

MATTY’S LAWYER (CONT’D)

The law is clear here We are
asking the court to acknowledge
this for what it is - a family
dispute A petty feud We
understand that unfortunately
Miss Mangano’s business is failing
No one’s sadder about this than my
client

(turns to Joy)
I know you’re divorced and are
raising three children and it must
be very hard We sympathize with
your financial struggles but we
also think we all know what this is-

(turns back to the Judge)
It is nothing more than a money
grab We are simply asking the
court to uphold our legally binding
contract Thank you your honor

JUDGE

Counselor who is Rudy Martorella

MATTY’S LAWYER
The plaintiffs father your honor

Mr Martorella please come take
the stand

Rudy stands up and makes his way to the stand

BAILIFF

Do you promise to tell the truth
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth so help you God

RUDY
I do

JUDGE
So Mr Martorella according to
this document you transferred
ownership of the patent to Mr
Aianello Is that true

RUDY
Yes your honor

JUDGE
How did you acquire the patent in
the first place

RUDY
I filed it at the office

JUDGE
No why did you file it Are you
the inventor of the mop

Rudy is visibly uncomfortable

RUDY
Uh well for a while I was kickin’
it around you know it’s not the
only thing I thought about
inventing I thought of an ashtray
on a stand that sits by the couch--

JUDGE
Did you invent the Miracle Mop Yes
or no

Rudy looks over in JOY’S DIRECTION but not at her He looks
in Matty’s direction Long pause He nervously fidgets

Toots stares at Joy for a long beat She grabs her purse off
the bench and heads into the courtroom

TOOTS
The man’s never even picked up a
mop in his life

This comment hangs in the air John appears

JOY
Where were you I’ve been looking
for you
JOHN
I had to go for a walk Clear my
head
JOY
We need a plan do you have a plan
JOHN
I think so

Joy is panicked The bailiff flags them into the courtroom

BAILIFF
Come on Let’s go

They enter the courtroom

INT COURTROOM MOMENTS LATER

Back in session Rudy is at the witness stand John stands
up

JOHN
So you invented the mop Is that
right

RUDY

Yes
JOHN
Wow That must be exciting to see
something like this take off for
you

RUDY
Yes yes it is

JOHN
So why was your daughter on TV
not you The inventor

RUDY
She handles the creative part I do
the business part of the deal

JOHN
Who handles the inventing part

Matty’s attorney stands up

MATTY’S LAWYER
Objection He’s asking the same
question over and over

JUDGE
Upheld
(to JOHN)
Do you have any new questions One
that hasn’t been answered already

John is searching He sees Joy She signals to him

JOHN
One second your Honor

John comes to Joy They whisper

JOY
I need to talk

JOHN
What

JOY

Tell him you want me to talk
JOHN

Joy you don’t want this to turn

into a quarrel here

She is dead stern

JOY
Please Do it

John turns to the Judge

JOHN
Your Honor Ms Mangano has
something she’d like to say

JUDGE
By all means

She grabs the mop off of the display table

JOY
Your Honor Will you please ask
Rudy to mop the floor

MATTY’S LAWYER
Objection--

Joy looks at the judge

JOY
He invented it I just want to see
him use it Ask him to come down
and mop the floor

JUDGE
Overruled
(turns to Rudy)
Mr Martorella

The judge signals for Rudy to come down to the floor Rudy
reluctantly gets up embarrassed and walks down to Joy Joy
hands him the mop and bucket

JOY
There’s no water in here but you
know what to do

Rudy shaking his head trying to act cool dunks the mop in
the bucket fumbles with the sliding mechanism a bit pushing
instead of pulling barely pulling it off It’s not a CLEAR
RESULT Rudy looks at the judge throwing his hands up as if
to say “See I did it”

JOY (CONT’D)
Sorry One more thing Can you ask
my dad to take off the mop head and
put it back on

Rudy tries to take the mop head off He can’t figure out
where the button is He tries a few different unsuccessful
ways

JOY (CONTD)
May I

Joy takes the mop and detaches the mop head in a millisecond
She then puts it back on and works the wringer She turns to
the judge

JUDGE
Mr Martorella you may sit down

Rudy goes back to his chair Joy goes back to her table and
turns to the judge matter of fact

JOY
This mop isn’t the first thing I’ve
invented Its just the first thing
anyone has ever bought Its really
amazing seeing people buy this
thing It makes me feel something
I’ve never felt before Proud I’m
sure these guys have that same
feeling Because they have the
‘paperwork’ right there that says
they own conceived and created my
mop They were the ones slipping on
the floor of Sam’s Diner at
midnight They were the ones that
figured out you need to put a pin
in the mop or it won’t work right
Or that if you slip your finger
over the housing when you’re
assembling it you’1ll get your skin
pinched every time Right guys
They have to know about the skin
pinching Because they have the
paperwork It says this mop is
theirs You could tell by the way
they talk about it Its personal
for them It’s their blood sweat
and tears I don’t have that
paperwork It was taken out from
underneath me While I was busy
trying to make this thing happen I
was betrayed And I guess honesty
and integrity don’t have a receipt
There’s no patent for hard work
(beat)
My whole life people have been
telling me you can’t do this and
you shouldn’t try that and you
dont deserve this It’s been like
noise in my head for a very long
time I just wanna walk away from
all the noise To you it’s a mop
To me it’s a way out All I’m
asking for your honor is what has
always been mine And the paperwork
to prove it Thank you

The judge nods He is quiet for a long time He calls the
bailiff over and whispers to him The bailiff walks out of
the room then comes back with more paperwork Joy watches
every move The judge finally speaks

JUDGE
Where are these mop molds being
held

MATTY’S LAWYER
In California at our Avalon
facility

JUDGE
Okay Counsel contact the facility
and have them load the
manufacturing molds all parts
dealing with the manufacturing of
these mops to be loaded onto trucks
and shipped here immediately

MATTY’S LAWYER

Okay

JUDGE
And take them to Ms Mangano’s
warehouse

MATTY’S LAWYER
Your honor

JUDGE
I’ll further order a sheriffs
escort to accompany the trucks to
make sure that nothing mysteriously
happens to the trucks along the
way I am not only granting the
TRO I hereby grant all legal
rights to the Miracle Mop and it’s
proceeds to Ms Mangano

RONNIE
Oh my God

MATTY’S LAWYER
We have the patent--

JUDGE
I’m nullifying the patent It is to
be re-filed in the name of Joy
Mangano

There is an audible reaction from the room He turns to Joy

JUDGE (CONTD)
Good luck to you

He hits the gavel Ronnie bursts into tears Everyone on
Joys side erupts in celebration Ronnie runs to Joy they
hug each other They all hug Joy hugs Toots who is
completely dumbfounded She hugs Ronnie very tightly

As she hugs Ronnie Joy looks over Ronnie’s shoulder across
the room to Rudy

Rudy sits isolated no longer part of the family no longer
respected by the mob Shamed He looks pathetic Joy
watches him A hint of sympathy comes across her face

Joys group excitedly starts to head out the door Last in
line Joy stops where Rudy is sitting A beat Then

JOY
We gonna see you for dinner on
Sunday

RUDY

Yeah Yeah that’d be good
