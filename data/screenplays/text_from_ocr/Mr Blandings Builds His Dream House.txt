EXT A LARGE NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
As CAMERA MOVES UP it and TOWARD a window

BILLS VOICE
For fourteen years Jim and Muriel
had been living in their apartment
over on East Seventy-fourth Street
It was just another of those wonderful
crisp September mornings and the
Blandings were still asleep Just
like millions of other people in
good old Manhattan -- New York City --
USA

The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO
INT THE BLANDINGS BEDROOM - DAY

Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are
asleep
in twin beds

The room not large to begin with gives us the
impression

of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds

SOUND of an alarm clock going off Jim awakens yawns

into hazy consciousness gropes about on the night

the clock it isnt there He slips out of bed and

his eyes blindly moves toward the dresser The
path which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity
going around the chaise lounge just missing the
pointed edge of Muriels dressing table deftly

over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching
chest of drawers upon which is the clock He turns off
alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path We
the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every
morning of his life

Back at his bed Jim sits down and yawning loudly
with his feet for his slippers Before he can find
however

he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back

the pillow pulling the covers over him In a moment he
sound asleep Muriels arm automatically stretches out
shakes Jim into consciousness As he painfully

starts to rise Muriels arm disappears

We get the impression that this too is a regular part

the Blandings daily routine
Jim locates his slippers reaches around for his

This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never

to be shared by two people particularly not Jim and
Blandings Assuming that they had started out on even
it is now obviously Muriel three-to-one Her dresses
slips seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks
or sports coat Her shoes neatly line the floor and the
above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes in
orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance
Groping blindly for a robe Jim feels around and pulls
out As he slips into the arms we see its much too
for him obviously Muriels In disgust he attempts to
it back Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in
two silk dresses which fall to the floor As he bends
and gropes for the dresses he discovers his robe

under them on the floor He drags the robe out and dons
leaving the dresses where they fell With a guilty look
Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the
and into the narrow hall

INT THE HALL

A narrow corridor extending the length of the

it are doors leading to the bathroom the childrens
and the foyer

Jim shuffles down the hall He stops at the closed
door listens hears the shower knocks

CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living
on through the very small combination dining and

nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen Gussie the
colored cook greets him heartily

GUSSIE

a smile)

Gussie takes a glass of hot water squeezes in a little

Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer Jim approaches
door to the childrens room With split-second timing
pauses as the door flies open and Joan in her

towel in hand rushes out and past him down the hall
disappears into the bathroom Jim carefully proceeds
the hall and as he reaches the bathroom deftly steps
the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on
way back to her bedroom All this is done with a timing
shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been
Jim continues down the hall enters the bedroom

INT THE BLANDINGS BEDROOM

Muriel is still asleep as Jim enters walks over

her
JIM

MURIEL

They kiss briefly Muriel starts to sip the coffee as
goes to his chest of drawers It consists of several
small drawers above and large drawers below Jim

through a couple of small drawers pulls out a suit of
underwear continues noisily and with some annoyance to
look
through the other drawers

MURIEL
Looking for something dear

JIM
(briefly)

MURIEL
Why dont you look in your sock
drawer

JIM
(with restraint)
Thats where I found my underwear

MURIEL

JIM

He reaches in and holds up one of Muriels silk slips

MURIEL
(sipping coffee)

Well they must be somewhere
(attempt at morning
cheeriness)

Socks just dont get up and walk

away by themselves

JIM
(strained patience)

He strides angrily to the closet opens the door
for the basket and pulls it off the shelf As he does
all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the
from his hand the socks spilling on the floor About
explode he looks at Muriel
MURIEL
Jim I do wish youd make an effort
to be a little less clumsy
JIM
(barely containing
himself)

Ill try dear
Jim looks at her barely containing himself and then
the hats back in the boxes jams them back on the shelf
they toter precariously With bated breath he gingerly
the closet door Pause Silence He picks up a pair of
and walks cautiously toward the hall door Suddenly
a rumble and crash from inside the closet Jim
look with Muriel is about to say something changes
mind exits into the hall Muriel looks at the closet

takes another sip of coffee

INT THE HALL
Jim opens the door of the bathroom There is a scream

He
quickly closes the door scowling with annoyance A
moment
later the door opens and Joan emerges wrapping her
robe
around her
JOAN
(sharply)

walks away)

hair follicles before Ive had my
orange juice

MURIEL
You dont have to carry on so I

electric razor

JIM
Because I prefer the cool clean
sweep of the tempered steel as it

INT THE BLANDINGS BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY

Narrow and small The four Blandings are at breakfast
and Muriel each reading his section of the morning
Betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook Joan

a magazine of popular science As we come in Gussie
off the orange juice is squeezing by Jim who

and automatically ducks his head as she passes Jim
uncomfortably turns the newspaper to another page

reacts with pained but controlled exasperation

JIM
Who did this

INSERT NEWSPAPER a section of which has been cut out
BACK TO SCENE
BETSY
(very matter-of-factly)

I did

She holds out her hand to Joan who automatically and
without looking up hands her the salt
passes it

She hands

to Muriel

JIM
I have repeatedly told you --
(ducking as Gussie
comes back with coffee)
-- dont cut up the morning paper
until Ive had a chance to look at
it

BETSY
Im sorry father Its necessary
research

the salt back to Joan who automatically

JIM
(with some sarcasm)
I suppose this is another of Miss
Stellwagons so-called Progressive
Projects

MURIEL
(using salt and handing
it to Jim)

Now dear there just isnt any point
in sending your children to an
expensive school if youre going to
undermine the teachers authority in
your own dining room

JIM
Im not undermining anything I happen
to be in the advertising business
and keeping abreast of the times is
important to me

MURIEL
And so is your childrens education

JIM
Thats not the point

MURIEL
It certainly is

JIM
It certainly is not

JOAN
(without looking up
from her magazine)
Bicker bicker bicker

JIM
You eat your cornflakes

Jim ducks as Gussie passes back on her way to the
kitchen

MURIEL

(handing Joan toast)
Joan every time your father and I
have a lively discussion we arent
necessarily bickering

(to Betsy solicitously)
What is it dear another English
composition

BETSY

(taking toast from

Joan)
Miss Stellwagon has assigned each of
us to take a want ad and write a
human interest theme about it

(to Jim passing toast

to him)
I found one typical of the
disintegration of our present society

JIM
(taking toast not
looking up from his
paper)
I wasnt aware of the fact that our
society was disintegrating

BETSY
I didnt expect you to be father
Miss Stellwagon says that middle-
class people like us are all too
prone to overlook the pressures and
tensions which befall the less
fortunate members of our community

Jim puts down the paper turns to Muriel

JIM
(with great restraint)
Muriel I know its asking a lot
but just one morning I would like to
sit down and have breakfast without
social significance
Picks up his paper

MURIEL
Jim you really might take a little
more interest in your childrens
education

JOAN
(without looking up)
You cant squeeze blood from a turnip

Jim reacts with painful resignation folds his arms
puts
down the paper turns slowly to Betsy

JIM
All right All right Ill listen

BETSY
(picking up her
scrapbook)
Its just twenty-four words But in
simple eloquence it mirrors a minor
tragedy of our times

JIM
(quietly)
Well

BETSY

(reading)
Forced to sell Farm dwelling oak
grove apple orchard trout stream
hay fields four barns seclusion
superb view original beams paved
highway acreage

(with emotion)
Will sacrifice

Pause
JIM
Go on
BETSY
(simply)
Thats all
JIM

Thats all
BETSY
You dont see it do you father

JIM
No Fellow wants to sell a house so
he puts an ad in the paper What did
you expect him to do take it to the
United Nations

MURIEL
There must be more to it than that
(to Betsy)
Isnt there dear

BETSY
Certainly mother What some people
dont see is the whole sordid picture
A poor honest farmer pushed to the
wall by hardship soil erosion
mortgages everybody gobbling
gobbling gobbling until finally
in desperation he is forced to
sell and stoops to the crass
commercialism of newspaper
advertising

JIM
(muttering)
Oh indeed crass commercialism
advertising

JOAN
(nose in her magazine)
Miss Stellwagon says advertising is
a basically parasitic profession

JIM
(with extreme control)
Oh she does

JOAN
Miss Stellwagon says that advertising
makes people who cant afford it buy
things they dont want with money
they havent got

JIM
(elaborate sarcasm)
Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right
Perhaps I ought to get out of this
basically parasitic profession
which at the moment is paying for
her very fancy tuition those extra
French lessons her progressive summer
camp and for that matter the very
braces on your teeth

MURIEL
I wish you wouldnt discuss money in
front of the children

JIM
Why not they spend enough of it

JOAN
Bicker bicker bicker

As Jim gives her a look and buries himself in his

paper the
downstairs buzzer rings Gussie enters squeezes by Jim
who
automatically ducks goes to the phone in bg
GUSSIE
Hello Who
(calls)
Miss Blandings theres a Mr
Funkhauser wants to see you
MURIEL
Funkhauser
(remembers)
Oh Mr Funkhauser
GUSSIE
Thats what he says
Muriel looks nervously at Jim who is preoccupied
reading
his paper Then she turns back to Gussie
MURIEL
Uh -- better ask him to come up
GUSSIE
(into phone)
Says to come up
Gussie hangs up squeezes by Jim exits into the
kitchen

Pause

MURIEL
(tentatively)
Oh -- uh -- darling Mr Funkhausers
here

JIM
(looking up)
Who
MURIEL

You remember Bunny Funkhauser that
clever young interior decorator we
met at the Collins cocktail party

JIM
(distastefully)
Whats he doing here

MURIEL
(nervously)
Well I imagine hes brought the --
uh -- estimates

JIM
(blankly)
EStimates

MURIEL

(rapidly to conceal

a feeling of guilt)
Darling you know how long weve
said weve got to do something about
this apartment and well he called
last week and I had him come over
and hes got some simply wonderful
ideas

JIM
(quietly)
There couldnt be two Bunny
Funkhausers could there

MURIEL
Why no dear

JIM
Then this is the same clever young
man whos responsible for that zebra-
striped monstrosity in the Collins
living room

MURIEL
That couch is terribly functional
JIM
Phil Collins told me what he paid
for all that function
(angrily)
If you think Im going to --

SOUND of doorbell ringing

MURIEL
Darling please
(changing subject)
Children youll be late to school
Run along and --

The children rise pick up their school paraphernalia

JOAN
Miss Stellwagon says that
functionalism in modern furniture --

MURIEL
Never mind dear

She hustles Betsy and Joan toward the foyer as Jim

rises
INT FOYER
Gussie has just admitted Mr Funkhauser He is a tall
slender effete-looking young man He is loaded down
with
sketches samples of wallpaper bolts of material
Betsy and
Joan brush by him on their way out
FUNKHAUSER
Good morning
THE GIRLS
(with a sharp
appraising look)
Hi
As they rush out and the door closes Jim and Muriel
enter

scene

MURIEL
Good morning Mr Funkhauser You
remember Mr Blandings

FUNKHAUSER
But of course

He sweeps by them into the living room taking over
completely

INT LIVING ROOM

FUNKHAUSER

Youll have to pardon my bursting in
at this dreary hour --

(puts a sketch ona

chair)
-- practically the middle of the
night --

(puts wallpaper against

mantel)
-- but I did so want to catch you
in Ive been at it hammer and tongs
all week and Im just a mess --

(drapes bolt of chintz

over high-backed

chair)
-- but then Muriel and I thought we
ought to talk it over with you before
we take the plunge

Funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which

to

display his last bolt of chintz finds none settles
for

Jims shoulder over which he drapes the cloth the
folds

flowing down in front As Jim reacts

FUNKHAUSER
(smoothing out folds
on the chintz)
After all its your home too and
it should reflect you You know
Mans Castle all that sort of thing

Jim looks down at the chintz

JIM
(ominously)
Muriel

MURIEL
(quickly)
Jim just wait till you hear Hes
got some wonderful ideas for the
foyer
FUNKHAUSER
Oh thats out All out Changed the
whole thing I just couldnt live
with it I said to myself Bunny
what are the Blandings How shall we
do them And the answer was perfectly
obvious Very American very grass
roots very blueberry pie -- that
sort of thing

JIM
(dark look at Muriel)
Mm

Funkhauser fingers the material of a drape
disdainfully
removes his hand

FUNKHAUSER
Now first lets dig into this living
room of yours its really a dreary

MURIEL
(quickly to Jim)
We want this room to be very gay
dear Something in bright reds
yellows and greens

JIM
(appalled)
Red yellow and green

FUNKHAUSER
Oh come Mr Blandings lets not
run away from color

JIM
Not running away --
(a lame joke)
-- just backing off a little

FUNKHAUSER

Uh -- yes

(brightly)
Now as I see our room its definitely
Colonial You know cobblers bench
breakfront pie cooler student lamp
hooked rug But everything in good
taste It must not jump out at you
and scream Look -- see how antique
I am
JIM
Heaven forbid

FUNKHAUSER
Of course these things take
imagination Youve simply got to be
able to visualize

JIM
(politely removing
chintz)
If youll forgive me Mr Funkhauser
what Id like to visualize -- at
this dreary hour -- is how much is
this all going to cost

FUNKHAUSER
Well really I hesitate to say
After all --
(indicates)
-- by the time this wall is out we
may find --

JIM
(reacting)
This wall is -- what

FUNKHAUSER
Out Source of light is from the
east Obviously if our room is to
have any function at all --

JIM
Youre going to tear out the wall

MURIEL
Dear its a wonderful notion

FUNKHAUSER
Visualize three feet of leaded panes
the rest --

JIM
Can you give me a figure

FUNKHAUSER
Well Costs arent what they used to
be you know and --

JIM
Just a figure
Jim looks

FUNKHAUSER
Materials are impossible labor has
just run wild --

JIM
Just an overall figure

FUNKHAUSER
Well I shouldnt like to be tied
down But I suppose if you must have
a figure Id say -- mm --
(lightly)

-- somewhere in the neighborhood of
seven

JIM

Mm Seven
FUNKHAUSER

Mm
JIM

That would be seven thousand
FUNKHAUSER

at Muriel considers

JIM
(soberly)
We-ll That seems fair
(gathering up materials)
After all were not running away
from color --
(picks up wallpaper)
-- and we are tearing out walls --
(picks up sketches)
Mr Funkhauser do you have a card

MURIEL
Jim we havent even discussed the
rest of the house

JIM
We will dear
(leads the whole batch
on Funkhauser)

FUNKHAUSER
ominously

(huffy)
Well really I --

JIM
(deftly steering him
toward the door)
Well talk it all out and then well
get in touch with Bunny

CAMERA TRUCKS with them to the door

FUNKHAUSER
Well really I mean I was under
the impression wed come to some
decision today

JIM

FUNKHAUSER

JIM
So nice of you to come
(puts Funkhausers
hat on his head)
Good day

And Funkhauser is gone Jim closes the door turns

MURIEL
(apprehensively)
Now darling you -- you just dont
go to a man like Funkhauser and ask
how much its going to cost before
you even know what hes going to do

JIM
No that would be too logical Seven
thousand dollars Blueberry pie I
wouldnt put seventy-five cents into
this broken-down rat trap

Perfectly all right

its certainly a lot older than
anything we had in mind

Shes no spring chicken --

such a buy

They look at him curiously Smiths attitude is matter-

Every time you get a little tight
you weep on my shoulder about the
advertising business and how it forces
a sensitive soul like yourself to
make a living by bamboozling the
American public

(picks up Smiths

correspondence)
I would say that a small part of
this victimized group has now
redressed the balance

You Youve been taken to the cleaners
and you dont even know your pants
are off

MURIEL
Dear I told you I said we should
call Bill --

JIM
Never mind Muriel
(to Bill challengingly)
All right just whats wrong with
this deal

BILL

First time around you offered ten
thousand dollars for fifty acres
right

JIM
What of it

BILL

Thats two hundred dollars an acre

I know that part of Connecticut and
one hundred dollars an acre is
standard top-gouge price to city
slickers When the natives sell to
each other its around forty or less

MURIEL
Forty dollars an acre

JIM
The mans entitled to a fair profit

BILL
Not two hundred and eighty-four
percent

(indicates papers)
And besides youre not getting fifty
acres youre only getting thirty-
five more or less

JIM
Where does it say that

BILL
(picks up letter)
I refer to a rather obscure post-
script on the back of the second
letter from Friend Smith

He hands the letter to Muriel

MURIEL

(reading)
Incidentally Mr Hackett has been
a little over-optimistic about the
acreage It will probably survey
somewhere in the neighborhood of
thirty-five acres more or less but
I feel sure

JIM
(on the defensive)
All right so its thirty-five Whats
the difference Do you know how many
tennis courts you can get on thirty-
five acres

BILL
Youre not spending eleven thousand
five hundred dollars for tennis
courts

JIM
Thats not the point

BILL
(very businesslike)

Thats precisely the point Were
going to write this Hackett a strong
letter and tell him he can either
kick in with those fifteen acres
reduce the price or find another
sucker

JIM
(rising emotion)
Well do no such thing Im not going
to queer this deal over fifteen broken-
down acres

MURIEL
(to Bill)
We were just going window shopping
and so far its cost us eleven
thousand five hundred dollars and
they even made us pay the commission

JIM
You dont understand business

BILL
You mean extortion

As Jim turns on Bill and is about to answer him
explosively

MURIEL
(thoughtfully)
I wonder if we could get another two
year lease on the apartment

JIM
(heatedly)
Now wait a minute You cant measure
everything on a slide rule This
house has certain intangibles

BILL
Like what for instance

JIM

Like antique value for instance It
just so happens that General Gates
stopped right there at that very
house to water his horses

BILL
I dont care if General Grant dropped
in for a scotch and soda -- youre

still getting rocked

JIM
That was a different war

MURIEL
I think Bills absolutely right
JIM

(struggling to contain

himself quietly)
Let me explain something To both of
you For fifteen years Ive been
cooped up in a four room cracker
box Just getting shaved in the
morning entitles a man to the
Congressional Medal for bravery

BILL
That doesnt make this a good buy

JIM

Bill -- Muriel and I have found what
I am not ashamed to call our Dream
House Its like a fine painting
You buy it with your heart not your
head You dont ask how much was
the canvas how much was the paint
You look at it and you say Its

beautiful I want it and if it
costs a few pennies more you pay it --
and gladly -- because you love it

and you cant measure the things you
love in dollars and cents

Muriel looks at Jim impressed her face softening with
compassion

JIM
(emotionally spent)
Well -- thats how I feel about this

place And when I sign those papers
Saturday I can look the world in

a distinguished-looking local architect He puffs

on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old
place an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through

SIMMS

Of course you could fix up that old
house You can fix up any structure
thats still standing The sills and
floors couldnt be worse I grant
you and I guess youd have to jack
up that west corner at least three
feet to make it level Need new
chimney New roof Complete new
plumbing

(sigh)
Too bad you didnt buy it ten years
ago Could have fixed it up in jig
time then and it would have made
some sense

JIM
(nervously nibbling
at his nails)
Uh-huh mm-hmmm uh-huh

SIMMS
Fact is before youre through it
would be less expensive to tear the
old place down and build a new one
same size

JIM
Mm New house
(as the notion sinks
in becomes attractive)
New house

MURIEL
(to Simms with
pleasant incredulity)

You mean for the same money we
could build a brand new house

SIMMS
It certainly wouldnt cost any more

JIM
(soberly)
Hm New house

He turns and looks thoughtfully at Muriel who raises an
interested eyebrow Then to Simms

JIM
(tentatively)
Just what sort of thing do you
have in mind

SIMMS
Well I imagine the type of house
youd want would be something in
quiet good taste two story frame
and brick veneer construction --
modern but of course fitting in
with the architectural traditions of
the countryside

JIM
Well I -- What do you think Muriel

MURIEL
I think it sounds fine

SIMMS
Perhaps youd like to see a basic
floor plan --
(reaches into file
behind him)
-- something like this
Simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before
the Blandings moving around flanking him They examine
plan with interest

uncompromising expertness of two people who have never

such a plan before in their lives

MURIEL
Its very nice Im sure but -- uh --
well -- doesnt it seem just a little

bit conventional

JIM
Yes Simms if we were going to build
a house we want it -- well you know --

just a little bit different

SIMMS
(hes heard all this
before)
Yes of course

JIM
Now for instance --
(takes Simms pencil)

JIMS VOICE

just push out this wall a little --
and put in a built-in bar we could --

Excuse me dear --

Her hand takes the pencil from his starts to trace

Jims fingers drum with the beginnings of

we see Simms hand holding a pencil point out

small And of course wed have to
have a little dressing room -- and --

As she draws it in Jims hand takes the pencil

Muriels
fingers drum nervously
JIMS VOICE
And closets Simms lots of closets
(traces them in)
If theres one thing this family
needs its closets
SIMMS VOICE
(as his hand reaches
for the pencil)
If I might make a suggestion --
But Muriels hand reaches the pencil first
MURIELS VOICE
(as she draws them in)
And bathrooms Mr Simms Each bedroom
must have at least one bathroom
SIMMS VOICE
But that would be four bathrooms
Mrs Blandings --
(his hand reaches for
the pencil)
I think Id better point out to you --
Jims hand reaches the pencil before Simms Now Simms
fingers

and Muriels drum in unison

JIMS VOICE
Just a minute Do you think --
(tracing)
we might manage a little playroom in
the basement nothing tremendous
you know something like this --

SIMMS VOICE
(as his hand reaches
for the pencil
cautiously)
Well its always possible but at
the moment our fundamental problem --
But Muriels hand has the pencil

MURIELS VOICE

(as she traces)
And Ive always wanted a little sewing
room upstairs --

(Jims and Simms

fingers drum

impatiently)
You know a little utility room where
I can be alone and sew or sulk or
on a rainy afternoon

JIMS VOICE
(as his hand takes
pencil)
Pardon me dear On that playroom
Simms not too small You know plenty
of room for ping-pong darts nice
big poker table

for another pencil)
If you dont mind I --

But Muriel has reached the pencil first As she and Jim

You could always move the chimney

You do that Simms but remember
weve got to hold it down to ten

That I can tell you right now is
impossible Even with a considerable
trimming of the things youve
indicated I dont see how we can
bring it in for less than twelve or
twelve-five

JIM
Twelve-five

Well I guess were not going to
quibble about a few pennies one way

No youll find Mr Blandings never

Honey you heard Simms As the house
stands now its over fifteen thousand

dollars
MURIEL
Well it just doesnt seem possible --
(afterthought)

for a house with such small rooms

SIMMS
(patiently)
Mrs Blandings Ive already
explained Its not only the size of
the rooms so much as it is the number
You see our primary problem is one
of cubage --

JIM
Thats right dear cubage

MURIEL
Whats that

JIM
(sorry he got into it)
just a figure of speech

MURIEL
But what does it mean

JIM
(a little irritably)
Cubage Its just the number of cubic
feet that --
(lost lamely)
-- go into a cubic foot Go on Simms

SIMMS
(consulting plans)
Now is it absolutely essential for
each of your daughters to have her
own room with two closets and a
separate bath

clearing his throat)
Yes You see er my daughters are
er approaching womanhood and er --

SIMMS

(brief look at the

girls)
I hadnt realized they were
approaching it quite so fast

(to Jim)
Perhaps what you need is not so much
a house as a series of little
bungalows

JIM
Hmmm
(examining plans)
What about that silly flower sink
We could eliminate that

MURIEL
I beg your pardon

JIM
Or that sewing room upstairs thats
certainly a waste

MURIEL
If were going to eliminate anything
well lose that ridiculous play room
in the basement with that great big
poker table

JIM
Honey Ive got to have some
relaxation

MURIEL

Weve got thirty-one and a half acres
Go out in the back and do a little
gardening

JIM
Sure and get poison ivy

SIMMS
(with dogged patience)
If I may interrupt Id like to
suggest that none of these are really
major eliminations Now if we could
do with one less bathroom on the
second floor --

MURIEL
Im sorry We couldnt possibly

SIMMS
Mrs Blandings a simple bathroom
eight by ten by eight with grade A
fixtures will cost around thirteen
hundred dollars

MURIEL
I refuse to endanger the health of
my children in a house with less
than four bathrooms

JIM
For thirteen hundred dollars they
can live in a house with three
bathrooms and rough it

SIMMS
Look perhaps the most practical
thing would be --

its New York buyer of the historic
old Hackett house

the old house to its original

its legal before you go barging
off and run yourself smack into

equally responsible

What What happened

SIMMS
Im afraid I dont understand

BILL

Jim)
Did you let this idiot tear down
that house

JIM
What if he did What of it

SIMMS
(to Bill)
Reconstruction was unsound and totally
impractical

BILL
I quite agree But youre dealing
with a man who doesnt think before
he acts who goes off half-cocked

JIM
What is it What did I do

BILL
(ignoring him to
Simms)
Youre an architect You must have
been aware of the legality involved

JIM
What What legality

BILL
(to Simms)
You knew there was a mortgage on
that house

SIMMS
I assumed as much

JIM
What happened What are you talking
about

BILL
(ignoring him to
Simms)
And you know the requirements in
regard to a mortgage where theres
demolition intended

SIMMS
Certainly But since you were his
lawyer I naturally assumed --

BILL
With a man like this you cant assume
anything

know what I did This is America A

Bill Ive had a very trying day
Would you mind telling me in clear
concise English just what crime Ive
committed -- and why

BILL

In clear concise English you tore
down a house on which another man
holds a mortgage without first getting
his written permission

JIM
Well I -- I did

BILL

And in such case the mortgagee can
demand the full payment of said
mortgage upon demand --

Two workmen pass by carrying a few long pieces of
lumber
The workmen dont see the Blandings

FIRST WORKMAN
I dont figure this Blandings at

windiest hill in Connecticut why do
you have to pick the windiest side
of the hill

BILL

The workmen pass from view

I think Id like to go outside

Just the man I want to see Would

As Bill starts up the stairs Jim and Muriel follow the
carpenter

skeptically

JIM

Un -- umm No I guess not
CARPENTER

Okay youre the doctor

(calls)
Hey fellas you got any of them
rabbeted lintels set rip em out

After the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails
brutally withdrawn from timber a loud splintering of

and then something of the appearance of entrails comes
hurtling down end over end landing with a dusty slap at
feet The carpenter exits Muriel gives Jim an accusing
look

JIM
(sheepishly)
It sounded less expensive to say
no

There is another loud screech and more entrails come

hurtling down narrowly missing them Muriel yells in
the

direction from which they came

MURIEL
Stop it Stop it

From upstairs comes a long shrill whistle Instantly
all
sound of activity ceases and a voice is heard

VOICE
Okay fellas lets quit

JIM
(to Muriel)
Now look what youve done

As Muriel turns with apprehension eighteen workmen
come
trooping down the stairs

JIM

(conciliatory)
Look men Mrs Blandings didnt
mean anything

(the workmen regard

him curiously)
I mean theres no point in walking
off a job just because a woman
makes a silly little remark

WORKMAN
Its Saturday mister We quit at
twelve oclock This aint a chain

but muffled pounding
They stop as they hear the thumping

MURIEL

MURIEL

Its coming from the closet

They rush to the closet open the heavy oak door Bill

BILL
The door blew shut I got locked in

JIM
Impossible I had this closet built

Jim picks up a piece of tar paper

MURIEL

Stop painting that floor and put
some planks down in here or some

It is dark outside and getting quite chilly The

are unpacking a last barrel They have made a rather
pile of books and boxes obviously Muriels personal
Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire
the fireplace The immediate result is a clouding of
room with smoke As he backs away coughing he bumps
the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box
contains among other things Muriels diary and a
accumulation of sentimental trinkets

JIM
Now look what youve done

Betsy coughs her way to the fireplace turns the flue
The smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room
to clear

BETSY
Father the first principle of
lighting a fire is to see if the
flue is open A three-year-old child
knows that

JIM
Next time we want a fire Ill send
out for a three-year-old child
(indicates trinkets)
Get that stuff cleaned up and go in
and help Gussie set the table Its
getting late

The children start gathering up the debris Joan picks
some trinkets which have spilled from a cardboard box

JOAN
Look Dad your fraternity pins

JIM
(busy cleaning the
fireplace)
Pins I only had one

JOAN
There are two of them here

All right all right Just put them

established pattern As Muriel puts the paste on her
replaces the tube shuts the cabinet and starts to

MURIEL
Excuse

JIM
Muriel do you have to do that now

MURIEL
Theres no need to be so irritable
just because you have to shave at
night

JIM
Im not irritable

MURIEL
Well youre certainly something
You havent said a civil word all
evening

JIM
Sometimes a man doesnt feel like
talking
MURIEL
(solicitously)
What is it dear Something down at
the office

JIM
No

MURIEL
Have you got the new slogan for
Wham

JIM

Its not due yet

MURIEL
Well its something Youre certainly
upset about something I can always
tell

JIM
Im not upset
(going back to shaving
with studied unconcern)
Its just that I dont happen to
approve of falsehood and deception
Particularly in my own wife

MURIEL
What are you talking about

JIM
(same)
Oh nothing Its just that I
distinctly remember your telling me
you gave back Bills fraternity pin
fifteen years ago

Muriel looks at him puzzled

JIM
Well did you or didnt you

MURIEL
Did I or didnt I what

JIM
Give it back to him

MURIEL
Of course I did If I said I did I
did

JIM
(suddenly Sam Spade)
Then perhaps youd have the goodness
to explain how this happened to fall
out of your jewel box

He takes the pin out of his pocket and hands it to her
Muriel

takes the pin looks at it sentimentally Suddenly she
looks

at Jim and bursts out laughing

JIM
Whats so funny

MURIEL
You Youre jealous Youre standing
there with your face full of soap
and youre jealous

JIM
(angrily)
If you were so crazy about the guy
why didnt you marry him

MURIEL
(beginning to be a
little angry)
Because I wasnt in love with him

JIM
(vindictively)
Thats not what you said in your
diary
MURIEL

(now really angry)
Oh now youve been reading my diary

JIM
(a little guilty)
Well -- it happened to fall open
and I happened to look at it
It just happened
MURIEL

Ill just bet

JIM
Its all over the book so why dont
winding

you admit it You were in love with
Bill Cole

MURIEL
Dont be absurd Of course I was in
love with Bill In those days I was
in love with a new man every week

JIM
Then why did you marry me

MURIEL

Im beginning to wonder

(exploding)
Maybe it was those big cow eyes of
yours or that ridiculous hole in
your chin Maybe I knew that some
day youd bring me out to this thirty-
eight thousand dollar icebox with a
dried-up trout stream and no windows
Or maybe I just happened to fall in
love with you -- but for heavens
sake dont ask me why

Muriel stalks out of the bathroom Jim looks after her
thoughtfully starts to dry his face

Jim enters Muriel stands with her back to him angrily

Would it do any good to say Im sorry

MURIEL
I dont know

Jim gently turns her around facing him
JIM
Well -- I am I acted like a schoolboy

Muriel looks at Jim Finally she smiles

Oh Jim

She goes into his arms and they kiss intimately As

Why dont you take the soap out of

INT BLANDINGS LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Jim comes into the foyer he sees Muriel in
nightgown

and robe talking to Mr Simms She holds the rolled-up
volume

of blueprints that went into building the house

JIM
Morning dear

MURIEL
(going to him
solicitously)
Darling you must be exhausted How
did it go
JIM
Fine Fine
They kiss
MURIEL

(obliquely)
Is everything all right

JIM
(unenthusiastic)
Everythings fine
(still in embrace
looking up)
Hello Simms what brings you out
with the morning dew

SIMMS
Just dropped by to check the
blueprints Some extras came in from
Retch this morning and therere a
couple of things I thought we ought
to go over together

JIM
(arms still around
Muriel unconcerned)
Really What are they

SIMMS
Well lets see
(thumbing through

sheets)
Few little things here all right I
guess Mortising five butts -- a

dollar sixty-eight

JIM
Lets not quibble about that A mans
entitled to mortise a few butts now
and then

SIMMS
(next sheet)
Extra nails and screws -- three

dollars eighty-nine cents

JIM
Petty larceny but let him get away
with it

SIMMS
Now theres one here I frankly dont
understand Ah here we are
(reads)
Changes in closet twelve hundred
and forty-seven dollars Did you
authorize that
JIM
Well we probably told him to --
(reacting)
Twelve hundred and what

SIMMS
Forty-seven dollars Changes in
closet
(hands bill to Jim)

JIM
(explosively)
Who does he think we are
(looks at bill very
businesslike)
Whats this notation Refer to Detail
Sheet Number one thirty-five

SIMMS
(indicating blueprints)
Far as I remember that would be
something in the back of the house
Lets just take a look

As he unrolls the blueprints Jim looks suspiciously at
Muriel She seems a little nervous

SIMMS
Ah here we are It isnt a closet
at all Its off the back pantry
Mrs Blandings little flower sink

JIM
Oh Mrs Blandings little flower
sink

SIMMS

(to Muriel)
You didnt authorize any changes

did you
MURIEL
(defensively)
Well they certainly werent
changes
JIM
What -- have -- you -- done
MURIEL

(speaking rapidly a
little confused)
I havent done anything And what I

did was just nothing at all
JIM

What -- have -- you -- done
MURIEL

Well --

(rattling off)
All I did was one day I saw four
pieces of flagstone left over from
the porch that were just going to be
thrown away because nobody wanted
them and I asked Mr Retch if he
wouldnt just put them down on the
floor of the flower sink and poke a
little cement between the cracks and
give me a nice stone floor where it
might be wet with flowers and things
That was absolutely all I did

During the above speech Simms sinks into a chair puts
his

head in his hands and closes his eyes a fact that
isnt

lost on Jim

JIM
Thats all you did

MURIEL
Absolutely Just four little pieces
of flagstone

SIMMS
(to Muriel wearily)
Did you by any chance authorize a
drain

MURIEL

(verge of tears)
Of course I didnt All I said was I
wanted a nice stone floor and Mr
Retch was just as nice as could be
and said Youre the doctor and
thats all anybody ever said to
anybody about anything

Jim takes a deep breath turns to Simms

JIM
-Well
SIMMS

(sigh plunging in)
All right I think I can tell you
what happened First the carpenters
had to rip up the flooring that was
already laid Those planks run under
the whole width of the pantry so
Retch had to knock the bottom out of
the pantry wall to get at them

JIM AND MURIEL

Jim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were

premeditating first-degree murder She averts his gaze
Over

this

SIMMS VOICE
Then he had to chop out the tops of
the joists under the flower sink
space to make room for a cradle I
guess he bought some iron straps and
fastened them to a big pan to give
him something to hold the cement
What with that added load on the
weakened joists Ill bet he had to
put a lally column down there for
support too

MURIEL
It was just four little pieces of
flagstone and I only ---

GROUP SHOT - DURING THE FOLLOWING SPEECH

GROUP SHOT - During the following speech we see Bill
Cole

in Jims pajamas and robe come down the stairs and
enter the

room Jim and Muriel are not aware of his presence

SIMMS
Well the main soil pipe runs under
there on wall brackets so Retch had
to get his plumbing man back to take
out a section so he could get that
cradle set I guess that meant he
had to change the pitch of the soil
pipe from one end of the house to
the other

(looks up)
Morning Mr Cole

BILL
Morning Hello Jim

JIM
(turning)

Hello Bill

Jim turns away reacts suddenly turns back to Bill

taking
in the pajamas and robe A little shocked but unwilling
to
believe the implication of what he sees he looks to
Muriel
for an explanation
MURIEL
(lamely)
The bridge was roped off and Bill
had to stay last night
JIM
-Oh
BILL
(cheerily)
Slept like a rock
JIM
Im delighted
Jim looks at Bill then back at Muriel
SIMMS
(clearing his throat)
And then of course there are hot
and cold water pipes hooked to the
joists right under that pantry They
go up to the wing bathroom on the
second floor and Ill bet my bottom
dollar he had to relocate them

Embarrassed pause

If youll all excuse me -- I -- I
think Ill just go up and slip into
something a little more comfortable

Bill exits Another pause Simms aware of the tension
wants
to get out of there

SIMMS
(rapidly)
Well thats about the size of it --

Through Simms speech Jim looks darkly at Muriel

SIMMS
-- except that Retch had to repair
the pantry wall and that meant getting
a plasterer back And of course he
couldnt have broken through that
wall --

JIM
All right Simms all right Well
take care of it

SIMMS
(preparing to exit)
Ill admit its a little steep But
Ill try to get Retch to knock a

hundred dollars off the bill If I
cant get that Ill certainly try
for seventy-five

JIM
Fine

SIMMS
If he doesnt go for seventy-five
Ill take a stab at fifty

JIM
You do that

SIMMS
(at the door)
Anyway Im almost sure we can get
twenty-five

There is no answer

He leaves

SIMMS
(lamely)
Well Good day

There is a deadly pause

MURIEL
(carefully)
Now dear youre upset youve got a
lot of things on your mind --

JIM
(with dangerous calm)
Muriel theres only one thing on my
mind -- This house -- and how fast
we can get rid of it

MURIEL
Thats not what youre thinking

JIM

Maybe its not Maybe Im thinking I
was once a happy man

(the martyr)
I didnt have a closet I didnt
have three bathrooms but I did have
my sanity a few dollars in the bank
two children who loved me and a wife
I could trust

MURIEL
Thats a fine thing to say

JIM
I also had a job at Danton and
Bascomb something I dont happen to
have at the moment

MURIEL

JIM
Thats right Ive resigned Were
starting all over again From scratch
And without this house

MURIEL
(near tears)
You love this house

JIM
I hate it

In the bg Mr Tesander enters cap in hand stands
there
nervous and embarrassed

MURIEL
You dont mean that

JIM

Every word of it Anybody who builds
a house today is crazy The minute
you start they put you on the list
The All-American Sucker list
Everywhere you turn theyve got a
hand in your pocket If you take out
their hands they find more pockets

(explosively)
Its a conspiracy I tell you a
conspiracy against every man and
woman who want a home of their own
Against every boy and girl who were
ever in love

Tesander clears his throat Jim turns
JIM
(sharply)
What do you want

A slight embarrassed pause Then
TESANDER
(shyly)
Well Mr Blandings theres a matter
of twelve dollars and eighty-six
cents

JIM

(with a wild gleam)
Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents
Why be a piker Mr Tesander

(emptying pockets)
Take everything Ive got Spread it
out among your pals

(advancing toward the

bewildered Tesander)
Wouldnt Retch like a little
something Maybe Zucca could use my
new dinner jacket Its open house
Mr Tesander Help yourself If this
isnt enough Ill come over to your
place and do some odd chores Maybe
I can mow your lawn or scratch your
back

TESANDER
(simply)
You dont understand Mr Blandings
This twelve dollars and eighty-six
cents -- you dont owe me I owe
you

There is a momentary pause

JIM
W-what was that

TESANDER
(taking out money)
Found I overcharged you Almost three
feet

He hands the money to Jim who stares at it blankly
TESANDER

Better count it I think its all
there

Jim looks haplessly at Muriel sheepish guilty

MURIEL
Thank you very much Mr Tesander
down the

TESANDER
Well I guess Id better be gettin
along
(looking around)
Sure got a pretty place here
(at door pauses

looks back)
Tll tell Mr Zucca about the dinner
jacket

TESANDER
Yep

What happened to him

MURIEL
Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents

BILL
Mind if I say something

Jim and Muriel look at him curiously

BILL

You know Ive kind of been the voice
of doom about this whole project
Every step of the way I was firmly
convinced you were getting fleeced
bilked rooked flimflammed and
generally taken to the cleaners And
maybe you were Maybe it cost youa
whole lot more than you thought it
would Maybe there were times when
you wished youd never started the
whole thing But when I look around
and see what you two have here -- I
