Do you believe in miracles I’m not
talking about watching your kid
being bornor the Red Sox winning
the World SeriesI’m talking

the-ass miracle

CAMERA PANS to FLORIO FERRENTE mid-forties standing among
the graves of Mayflower pilgrims Florio could lose a few
pounds but he’s strong as a bull He speaks to the
CAMERAwarm friendly

FLORIO (CONTD)
Like walking on wateror jumping
out a window and landing on a
cloudMaybe you don’t because
you’ve been around and you’ve seen
too much I was like that once

Florio turns to walk away and we follow him through a picture-
perfect New England town

THE OLD FRANKLIN STREET FIREHOUSE

The jewel of Old Town surrounded by impeccably restored
historical buildings

Suddenly lights flash sirens blare Firemen and Paramedics
scramble like ants into fluorescent green vehicles and go
racing off down the street
FLORIO
Look at these guysthey’re not
happy unless they’re rushing off to
knock down some three alarm
somewhere Not meMaybe in
younger days but not no more
Knowing where my loved ones
areknowing they’re safethat’s
what keeps my heart pumping

Thena distant BOOM Florio smiles

FLORIO
Yacht club cannon It’s the rich
guys’ tellin’ the sun it’s okay to
set

As Florio strolls through the town he stays constant but
his surroundings magically change He does not acknowledge
any of the passersby nor do they acknowledge him

FLORIO
This here is Marblehead
Massachusetts A lot of “Headers”
have been here for
generationsLived out their whole
lives here without even thinking
about it

Florio smiles warmly as he points to a small hospital over a
hundred years old

Sam laughs and joins in raucously

CHARLIE AND SAM
SCHOOL’S OUT FOREVER

The boys barely aware of the blast of the yacht club canon as
the sun goes down as they continue to throw and sing

EXT THE HARBOR - AFTERNOON

A glorious summers day Wednesday sailboat races are in full
swing The water’s dotted with about ten small sailboats
each with a two man crew zipping around the triangular
course marked by buoys

Charlie and Sam are dragging their weathered-looking sailboat
down the beach to the water Identical to all the other boats
in dimension and form the boys’ boat looks like it’s been
fitted with salvaged parts The sails are patched the lines
frayed

On the watertwo guys are sailing by in their pristine
boat One guy CONNORS calls out

CONNORS
Hey losersIf it don’t sink
were gonna kick your butts
SAM
Bullshit Connors You’re the one
who’s going down

Connors just laughs and sails off

CONNORS
Bring a bucket

Sam turns to Charlie
SAM
Nice boatCan we beat them

Charlie just smiles

EXT ON THE WATER - DAY

CHARLIE AND SAM’S SAILBOAT

The brothers are competent sailors and work great together as
a team Both boys are exhilarated as they whip through the

wind Charlie at the helm shouts to Sam

CHARLIE
Ready to come about

Sam rushes into position shouting

SAM
Ready

And Sam removes the winch handle places it in winch pocket
Charlie pushes the tiller starts the turn He shouts

CHARLIE
Helms to Lee

Sam does what he’s told then

SAM
(shouting)
Here comes Connors

Connors boat is on the port side coming up fast

Charlie loves the competition he’s having the time of his
life He skillfully manages to stay ahead of Connors and even
steal his wind as the boats cover the distance to the next
buoy but Connors is also skilled and he begins to gain
ground

CHARLIE
(to Sam)
Take the tiller

Sam is thrilled and terrified at the same time He scrambles
into position in the cockpit and grabs the tiller arm
Charlie hurries to the windward gunwale grabs a knotted rope
and hikes out counterbalancing the pressure of the wind

The mast straightens up the sail catches more wind and the
boys’ boat begins to pull away
SAM
Yaaaaahoooo

Connors attempts to mimic Charlie’s strategy but has to
buckle himself into a harness and loses precious seconds The
boats approach the last buoy Charlie pulls himself inboard

CHARLIE
Here’s where we win it Sam
You know what to do

SAM
Ready

Charlie’s watching Connor’s boat from the corner of his eye
Sam steers close to the buoy As it passes abeam

CHARLIE
Okay Sam do it

Sam throws the tiller over the boom swings Charlie ducks it
and comes up on the other side as the boat angles smoothly
around the buoy The sail fills with new air and the boat
takes off planing across the water

Sam can barely contain his enthusiasm

SAM
We’re hauling ass Whoo-hooooo
(he calls out)
Oh Con-norsToodles

Connors scowls as he fumbles with his fouled sheet Charlie
and Sam pull away

SAM
(offering the tiller)
Here you go Charlie

CHARLIE
You’re doin’ great Take her across
the line

Sam beams at Charlie who mock-salutes his little brother

SAM
Hey I just won five bucks
(Charlie looks at him)
I bet Connors five bucks that we’d-

CHARLIE
You don’t have five bucks
SAM
(smiles )
I do now

Sam and Charlie laugh their heads off They cross the finish
line and circle their little boat into the holding area A
shadow falls over them The boys look up

SAM
Whoa

Cruising past the dock on the way to its anchorage is the
most beautiful and fastest looking sailboat the boys have
ever seen

CHARLIE
No shit

Its lines are pure artistry the proportions perfect the
hardware and teak decking gleam in the sun

A handsome young couple smiles from the open cockpit the
girl waves at Sam and Charlie as the craft motors toward the
open ocean The boys can only watch it slide past their
mouths hanging open in awe and respect

CHARLIE

That’s it That’s our boat
SAM

It is
CHARLIE

Yeahthe one you and I are gonna
sail around the world

SAM
You know how much a boat like that
costs

CHARLIE

Sam looks at Charlie with something like hero-worship Then
excitedly

SAM
We can do it Charlie It’ll be
awesome beyond awesomeI say we

CHARLIE

SAM
Why not

Charlie pauses for dramatic effect He lowers his eyes He’s
about to deliver some very bad news

SAM

(baffled)
We can’t start on the boat tonight
because of Pirates

CHARLIE
(creeping smile)

Sam’s face goes from stunned disbelief to an ear-to-ear grin

SAM

The big guy behind him stands up and shouts

Charlie suddenly grabs Sam under the arms hoists him up up
into the air Sam holds out his glove

And he makes the catch

Sam snickers at his own joke Charlie presses the gas pedal
The old Buick slides out onto the main highwayand stalls
out again

SAM

monstrously out of the dark

TRACK From behind - a man running toward the wagon
No sound but his breathing and the crunch of boots on glass

Ferrente

We read the gravity of the situation in his face

Now at the upturned Buick Florio kneels to the drivers
window and peers inside

Sam’s well attended funeral is winding down The banged-up
Charlie positively numb from the pain and grief sits in the
front row with his mother Louise who sobs uncontrollably
Charlie’s holding onto Sam’s baseball glove it’s got a ball
in the pocket The REVEREND finishes his eulogy as Sam’s
small coffin is slowly lowered into its grave

REVEREND
Lord we commend this body to
you

Charlie rises from his seat and limps over to the grave He
stands above the grave prepares to drop Sam’s glove onto the
coffin below

Charlie tries but he just can’t let go of that glove His
whole body shudders Charlie runs blindly toward the woods

LOUISE

EXT WOODS - SUNSET

Charlie runs out of the tended part of the cemetery into the
woods He runs until he bursts through the woods into a
clearing He stops windedthenhe looks up to the sky

CHARLIE
(anguished cry)
Why did you leave me

And Charlie takes the baseball from the glove and hurls it at
the sky with all of his might Then overcomehe drops onto
the grass tries to block out the pain

And thenthe baseball slowly rolls into his field of
vision

Charlie’s astoundedHe raises his headWhat he sees
cannot possibly be realbut he sees it

Standing before him in the glow of sunset is Sam

DISSOLVE INTO
EXT WATERSIDE CEMETERY - MORNING
Close on a gravestone
SAMUEL ST CLOUD
June 15 1983 - June 9 1995

A cone of high-pressure water blasts leaves and bird
droppings from the stone Widen to reveal Charlie wielding
the power washer

Charlie’s pushing thirty now He’s still boyishly handsome
but in his eyes you can tell that he’s no longer young He
wears a uniform of some sort - a pale blue shirt pressed
khakis and work boots

In the bg WE SEE cemetery workers doing various chores
washing monuments clearing away branches trimming hedges
etc

Charlie nods with satisfaction as his chore nears completion
Sam’s gravestone is sparklingThenhe hears
somethingHe looks up to see a flock of noisy geese passing
overheard Charlie watches them Then he glances back at his
brothers grave and smiles mysteriously He finishes off the
work gathers up the equipment and starts away Then he
notices somebody

ANGLE - MRS PHIPPS

An elderly woman kneeling beside a monument which sits atop
a fresh mound of dirt She is lost in thought Charlie
approaches her gently

CHARLIE
Mrs Phipps

She looks up startled The old woman is frail and
wannearly transparent

CHARLIE (CONTD)
(smiles )
It’s me Charlie St Cloud Tenth
grade English remember

She looks him over Then

MRS PHIPPS
Shame on you Mr St CloudIt is
I

CHARLIE
Oh right
(smiles )
Me stand corrected

She smiles faintly Then returns to gazing at the gravestone

CHARLIE
I just wanted to offer my
sympathies

She looks up at Charlie filled with sorrow

MRS PHIPPS
It was just so sudden So
unexpected I never even had time
to say goodbye

CHARLIE
I’m sorry

MRS PHIPPS
I suppose there’s never enough
time is there

Charlie shakes his head smiles sadly Then Mrs Phipps
stands up she’s frightened and unsteady

MRS PHIPPS
What’s going to happen to me now
What will I do

CHARLIE
(comforting)
It’s going to be all right Trust
me I know

And she smiles Charlie has reassured her

And now we see the gravestone that Charlie and Mrs Phipps
are looking at The inscription reads

AMANDA PHIPPS

ANGLE - JOE TRIMMING THE HEDGES
Joe’s an African American dude who works for Charlie Joe

toward the gravestone right beside her own

MRS PHIPPS
Waltermy sweet WalterI wonder

CHARLIE
(smiles )
Sure he’s waiting Good thing
you’re wearing that pretty blue
dress

Mrs Phipps smiles no longer afraid

MRS PHIPPS
I guess there’s really no point in
lingering is there

With a final smile for Charlie she walks toward the forest

with slow but purposeful stepsCharlie waves goodbye And
then she is gone Charlie turns around to see Joe standing

there

JOE
Know how a man in the desert who’s
gone without food and waterhow
he starts imagining shit

Charlie knows what’s coming He starts walking down the hill
with Joe on his heels

JOE (CONT’D)

booty bro That’s why you’re
talking to yourself

Charlie wants to change the subject

CHARLIE
How about running into town for me

pick up the sprinkler heads and
grab a beer over at Maddies

Charlie just looks at him Then

CHARLIE

Charlie starts walking away Joe talks after him

JOE

goodbyes about to get into their various vehicles But Joe’s
lingering waiting around A WORKER says to him

it up and gets into his car

The place is simply furnished there are loads of books on
every subject and up on the wallsa jumble of maps and

weather chartsalso pictures and sketches of sailboats

sailboats and more sailboats

Charlie’s changed into jeans and a sweatshirt He’s throwing
things into a bag - a toy of some sort and a baseball glove
He starts for the door but before heading out he stops to
check out one of the weather charts stuck on the wall He’s
focusing on the daily sunset times as he tracks down with his
finger

There it is Thursday the 28th Sunset 726 PM Charlie
looks at his watch and starts for the door

EXT THE COTTAGE - CONT

Bag in hand Charlie takes off running towards the woods
weaving between the headstones

EXT THE GLADE IN THE WOODS - EVENING

Charlie races into the dark deserted glade He stops and
smiles at the sight before him

CHARLIE

He sees
THE GAGGLE OF GEESE
Frolicking on the lake that runs through the woods
Charlie reaches into the bag and removes a toy remote control
boat He’s only barely aware of the sound of the yacht club
cannon that’s fired off at sunset Then-

CHARLIE

still hanging around her grave

SAM

teeth cleaned

CHARLIE
Yep

SAM
(laughs )
It was only a matter of time before
Dr Vogel killed someone with his
stinky breath

CHARLIE
She was old She had a heart
attack

SAM
(laughs )
A likely story Vogel’s breath has
actually stopped charging rhinos
(watching boat)
Fifty feet and closing

CHARLIE

guess she missed her husband

SAM
(laughs )
Old man Phipps The guy with no big
toe
CHARLIE
(laughs )

SAM
(excited)
-08 knots Target acquired

The boat has reached geese vicinity The birds regard it with
mild curiosityThen

SAM
Fire

Charlie presses some buttons on the remote control box
On the boat - the horn blares and lights flash

The geese are totally freaked They take off flying for
their lives

Charlie and Sam are laughing heartily High fiving each
other

CHARLIE
Mission accomplished

SAM
Adios amigos

One big goose - obviously a pissed off alpha male is heading
back toward Charlie and Sam honking at them

SAM
Uh-oh

CHARLIE
He isn’t happy Sam That’s not a
happy honk

Now the goose comes swooping toward them Charlie and Sam
laugh

SAM
Let’s get out of here

And they race off laughing all the way
LATER - IN THE GLADE

It’s twilight now the stars are coming out Charlie and Sam
are stripped down to shorts Charlie’s standing up on a the
homemade swing that’s right over the lake Sam’s standing
there laughing

SAM
Look out he’s actually standing
up Don’t try this at home kids

CHARLIE
Yee-ha

And he leaps off the swing and goes into the lake When he
emerges Sam laughs

SAM
Wowand the judges are going
insaneCharlie St Cloud’s score
is a whoppingminus 10

Charlie laughs from the water

CHARLIE
Let’s see you do better wiseass

SAM
Coming right up

Sam’s on the swing now swinging and swinginghigher than
is humanly possible

SAM
Here comes Sam St Cloud’s world
famous supersonic quadruple
flying summersault

Charlie just watches from the water as Sam goes flying off
the swing

Sam seems suspended in air before doing a supernatural flip
spinning about five times in the air

Charlie just watches filled with awe and wonder and joy
EXT THE GLADE LATER

Charlie and Sam stand in a dim circle of light in the center
of the clearing They throw the ball back and forth

CHARLIE
(grim)
I gotta go into town tomorrow
Pick up some stuffI can already

tour groups

SAM
(laughs )
The head of the hysterical society

CHARLIE
(mocking female voice)
“Waterside Cemetery is a historical
landmark Mr St Cloud and
overgrown hedges will not be

SAM
(laughs )

Sam smiles then

SAM

CHARLIE

SAM

Sam starts running out Charlie rears back throws a high fly
arcing fly ball

CHARLIE
(like an announcer)
It’s a long hard drive It could be

his horse

Sam’s racing back the ball’s heading over his head
CHARLIE
He’s at the wall now but that ball
is goinggoing
Sam leaps impossibly high into the air He snags the ball
with a one handed catch And thenhe smiles at Charlie and
disappears

CHARLIE

Charlie smiles and waves

INT CHARLIE’S COTTAGE - NIGHT

Charlie is curled in an armchair with a sailing magazine
CLOSE ON MAGAZINE PHOTO A color photograph of a beautiful
serious-looking young woman standing on a dry dock beside a

magnificent sailboat suspended from a cradle The headline
reads “Tess Carroll’s Radical New Design”

Charlie stands and walks to the table which is littered with
the remnants of a meal for one and hand-drawn sailboat
design sketches He compares his designs with the boat in
the magazine

The sudden discordant ringing of the telephone breaks his
concentration The machine kicks in The outgoing message is
generic

MACHINE MESSAGE
Please leave a message Beep

LOUISE (VO)
Hi Charlie it’s mom I’m just
calling tosee how you are

Charlie just looks at the phone He can hear the pain in his
mother’s voice He knows he should pick it up

LOUISE (VO)
Its been so long since we’ve seen
each other and Portland’s so nice
this time of yearI was hoping
you might come up

Charlie closes his eyes and rubs his hand across his face

LOUISE (VO)
AnywayCall me soon Please
Charlie I love you Bye

The line goes dead A long moment Then slowly his eyes drift
down to the magazine on the tablethe picture of Tess
Carroll and that incredible boatCharlie sighs deeply and
off the boat’s picture we

DISSOLVE INTO
A SPARKLING WHITE MAINSAIL

Is being hoisted up the mast of Tess Carroll’s magnificent
“Querencia” It’s emblazoned with the words CARROLL SAILS

EXT MARBLEHEAD DOCK - MORNING

As the mainsail goes up the small gathering applauds TESS
CARROLL prettier than her magazine picture is emotional as
she watches Her mother GRACE who’s got a yellow lab called
Bobo on a leash and TINK WEATHERBEE a big bull of a man
stand at her side

TINK
The girls worked day and night on
her Best we ever built

We see now that the boat is docked in front of CARROLL SAILS
a shop on the wharf Now Tess addresses the sail shop staff

TESS
I don’t know if I’m gonna win this
race or not but I can tell you this
for surethat mainsailit’s
going to be seen by sailors on five
continentsand it is glorious
Thank you You did my father
proud

The staff applaud Tess wish her luck etc Her emotional mom
says

GRACE
Your father would be proudAnd
damned jealous too

Tess smiles Her mother kisses her

GRACE
Have you seen your Aunt Abby yet

TESS
No mom but-

GRACE
She hasn’t got long so you get
your tail over there

TESS
I promise I’1ll see her before I
take off

And as Grace goes off with the dog A WOMAN approaches Tess
with her TEN-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

WOMAN
Excuse me Miss Carroll Could she
have your autograph
The smiling girl hands Tess an autograph book to sign

TESS
I’d be honored

GIRL
My name is Katie

WOMAN
You’re such a great role model for
a girl her age

Tess hands the autograph book back to Katie
TESS
I’ll probably get pretty lonely out
there KatieMaybe you’d like to
email me

The girl looks at Tess with pity

KATIE
You don’t have a boyfriend do you

The girl’s mom smiles embarrassed Tess chuckles Tink
approaches

TINK
Tess that reporter is here

We see a tv crew walking toward the boat Tess makes a
face

TINK

It’s good for business
TESS

Okay but you’re buying me a

beer

downward

laughs and sighs

MARGIE

Charlie smiles nervously

CHARLIE

Margie just looks at him like”Yeah right” Charlie
avoids her eyes Glances over at the bank of tv’s that are
playing on the wall He’s surprised to see who it is

CHARLIE
Tess Carroll

ON THE TV’S - AN INTERVIEWER WITH TESS CARROLL

Charlie’s still watching the tv preoccupied

CHARLIE

FRANK

CHARLIE

Margie and her father exchange looks

EXT CHARLIE’S PICKUP TRUCK - DAY

Charlie tosses the box inside He’s about to get in and drive
offbut insteadhe drifts to the corner and looks down
toward the dock There he sees

TESS’S BOAT - THE QUERENCIA

People are still milling around as Tess’s interview wraps up
Charlie stands there transfixed by its sheer beauty

Then rounding the corner he sees

A TOUR GROUP

Led by Marblehead Historic Commission President FRAFFIE
CHAPMAN Fraffie’s a no-nonsense gal with white poofy hair

FRAFFIE
George Washington visited
Marblehead not once but twice and
see that house over there Well

She’s seen him Charlie tries to hide behind a mini-van

FRAFFIE
I see you St Cloud

Charlie starts walking fast

CHARLIE
I’m in a hurry FraffieSorry

Fraffie’s coming after him

FRAFFIE
Come back here St Cloud

Charlie slips around the corner and ducks into the nearest
doorway It’s Maddie’s bar

INT MADDIE’S - CONT
Charlie just hovers peering through the window
AT THE BAR

A couple of guys around CHARLIE’S AGE MIKE and JACK spot
him hovering near the window They exchange mischievous
smiles

Through the window Charlie sees Fraffie Chapman as she gives
up the chase and returns to her tour group He’s about to
slip out when Mike and Jack approach smiling

MIKE
How’s it going there Charlie

JACK
Long time no see

Charlie’s nervous He dislikes running into people he knows

CHARLIE
Hey

JACK
(to the bartender )
You see this man here Best damned
shortstop Marblehead High ever had
(to Charlie)
How many double plays we turn
Charlie A couple of hundred

Charlie smiles but he just wants to go Mike grabs his arm

MIKE
Have a beer with us

CHARLIE
Thanks but I can’t I-

JACK
You owe me Charlie Didn’t I fix
you up with Betsy Lane the hottest
cheerleader in school

CHARLIE
I fixed you up with Betsy Lane

JACK
(laughs )
You did Hell then I guess it’s me
who owes you What are you having

Having a beer with some friends is something Charlie hasn‘t
done in quite a long timeHe checks his watch decides he’s
okay on time He says to the bartender

CHARLIE
Sam Adams

Mike and Jack pat his back and he sits at the bar

INT MADDIE’S - LATER

Charlie’s on his third beer with Mike and Jack and
everybody’s feeling pretty good

MIKE
-Lots of people been married

JACK
(laughs )
Not to the same woman

Charlie smiles then checks his watch He panics

CHARLIE
Shit

JACK
What’ s-

CHARLIE

Charlie gets up but Mike bars his way

MIKE
Not so fast Charlie
(winks at Jack)
We think you need a little break
from the cemetery

CHARLIE
What are you-

JACK
We’re gonna sail out to the point
What do you say Charlie Want to-

Now Charlie’s really panicking The thought of missing Sam
overwhelming

CHARLIE
I can’t I-

Charlie tries to move past him but Mike bars his way
MIKE
Back in the old dayswhen a
sailor didn’t want to shove off
he’d get shanghied

Charlie tries to get around him Mike holds on to him

MIKE
They’d conk ‘em over the head
JACK
Or they’d slip him a micky and-
CHARLIE
(struggling)

Let go of me

MIKE
Next thing he knew he was waking up
on a boat somewhere in the middle
of the North Atlantic

And Charlie completely loses it He breaks free of Mike and
throws a punch that hits Jack square in the jaw Jack goes
down Charlie grabs up the nearest beer bottle smashes it on
the table waves it around and shouts

CHARLIE
Get out of my way

The guys the patrons the bartenderthey just stare at
Charlie

MIKE
We were just messing with you
Charlie

Charlie’s still in panic mode He tosses the bottle down
heads for the door Standing there are Tess and Tink whove
come in just in time to witness this They’re just looking at
Charlie like he’s a madmanCharlie not even realizing it’s
Tess Carroll charges right past her out of the door

TESS
Who’s that

TINK
(disgusted)
The local color

Tess watches Charlie running off through the window he’s
familiar somehow

EXT CEMETERY EDGE OF WOODS - TWILIGHT

Charlie runs across the field and plunges into the woods
EXT THE CEMETERY WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON

Charlie bitterly curses himself as he runs

CHARLIE
Idiot Idiot

EXT THE GLADE - TWILIGHT
Charlie bursts into the clearing
CLOSE ON He stops Sam is not there

Terrified panicking he yells as he runs into the center of
the clearing

CHARLIE
Sam Sam

No answer Charlie wheels around frantically scanning all
directions - the lake the swing the treesno sign of him
Charlie can feel the dread rising up in himHe tries again
desperate

CHARLIE
Come on out Sam I’m not in the
mood for games
(soft like a prayer)
Please Samplease

And then

VOICE (0S)
Jesus Charlie

Charlie spins around It’s Sam He’s smiling

SAM
Don’t have a cow

Charlie’s heart is still racing his chest heaving He’s
angry and relieved at the same time

CHARLIE
Where were you

SAM
I was right-

CHARLIE
I’ve never been late before
Not once in thirteen years

And thenin the distance the sunset canon booms Charlie
is surprised Sam laughs

SAM
You aren’t late You’re right on
time

Charlie realizes Sam’s right He’s flooded with relief

CHARLIE
I justI got held up in town and-
SAM
(excited)

Whoa You got held up No way

CHARLIE
(has to smile)
Not like that

SAM
(disappointed)
Oh

Charlie’s blood pressure has finally returned to normal He
pulls the crumpled up sailing magazine out of his jacket
pocket

CHARLIE
I want to show you something

EXT THE GLADE - LATER

Charlie and Sam lie side by side on the grass poring over
the sailing magazine with the Tess article

CHARLIE
Look the keel’s insane
(building enthusiasm)
It cants right but
I wonder how she’d do with
flukes

SAM
Whoa cool Like on a whale

CHARLIE
I wish I’d gotten a closer look

Sam leers at the picture of Tess in the magazine

SAM
Yeah me tooTess Carroll’s a
babe

CHARLIE

That so
Sam reads from the magazine

SAM (contd)
Tess Carroll says ” My man Sam St
Cloud is a stud and a half He’s
got the moves that drive me-”

Charlie laughing tries to grab the magazine

SAM

(fighting him off)
No no OK seriously

(reading again)
She said “We developed the boat
specifically for the Around The
World Challenge which starts next
week out of Boston Harbor

Trailing off Sam looks to Charlie He says wistfully
SAM (cont’d)
So she’s gonna sail around the

world huh Remember when

CHARLIE
Yeah

A slight moment of awkwardness Sam dispels it with a laugh

SAM
Yeah rightA girl No way

Charlie smiles and shakes his head

CHARLIE
Get your glove

Charlie grabs his and soon they’re throwing
INT CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The bedside clock says that it’s 12 AM Charlie’s just lying
there staring at the ceiling Finally he gets out of bed
and starts throwing on his clothes

EXT MARBLEHEAD STREET - NIGHT
A light is still on in the sail shop

Charlie makes his way toward the harborwhere Querencia is
docked

Charlie’s heart beats faster as he approaches the boat He
gazes up at the aerodynamic lines of the big beautiful boat
The word just comes out of him

CHARLIE
Wow

He reaches out and lovingly trailing his hand along the
keel’s sleek surface walks the length of the boat Not
really looking where he’s walking he suddenly finds himself
face to face with Tess

TESS
(angry scared)
What are you doing here
What do you want

CHARLIE
(flustered)
I’mI justwanted to see your
boat Up close I mean

TESS
Now you’ve seen it

CHARLIE
I’m sorry if I scared you

TESS
You don’t scare me

CHARLIE
Good

Charlie reaches into his pocket she jumps

TESS
Hey

The flustered Charlie produces the crumpled article from the
shipping mag

CHARLIE
I justI really admire your boat
design andI promise you I’m
harmless

TESS
(glaring)
That so Because I was at Maddie’s
today and-

CHARLIE
(embarrassed)

(holds out his hand)
Lookmy name is-

TESS
(not taking his hand)
Charlie St Cloud

Charlie just looks at her stunned

TESS
I was two years behind you in high

CHARLIE

TESS

CHARLIE

turns around

CHARLIE
Flukes
TESS

CHARLIE
On the keel For windward lift
TESS
Flukes
CHARLIE

Like on a whale flipper

Charlie makes a wave motion with his hand Tess is just
looking at him

CHARLIE
Good luck with the race

And he hurries off Tess just watches him then Tink appears
on deck he’s got a printout of some sort He doesn’t see
Charlie
TINK
See here There’s a front moving
in from Maine

TESS
I’1l go around it

TINK
Maybe this test run can wait til-

TESS
Tell me something TinkWhat

Tink just looks at her
EXT MARBLEHEAD FORESHORE - NIGHT
CLOSE ON Charlie gazing longingly out to sea

He sits in a small foreshore park watching Tess’s navigation
lights head out of the harbor

DISSOLVE TO

EXT QUERENCIA - DAY
The sun is coming up on the horizon
The boat is sailing smoothly through relatively calm sees
INT COCKPIT - DAY
Tess is on the radio with Tink
TESS (INTO RADIO)
I’m just a little bit East of the
Buzzard Bay light
INTER CUT - TINK’S OFFICE
TINK (INTO RADIO)
Good girl Stay on that course and
you should clear the weather
TESS (INTO RADIO)
(smiles )
Check in with me later
And she hangs up the headset and heads up to-
EXT MAIN DECK - CONT
Tess takes the helm gazes back toward the distant coastline
then smiling wickedly her eyes lovingly caress the sleek
lines of her yacht
TESS
Okay kiddo here’s the dealif
we can’t make it through a little
low pressure system how are we
ever gonna make it all the way

around the world

And thenpulling down hard on the wheel Tess begins to
tack the boat

TESS
What do you say You up for it

CLOSE ON The cockpit compass As Querencia turns the
compass spins from south - to north

She eases the main sheet to a broad reach and fills the
headsail with wind The boat immediately gains speed

Squaring her face to the rising wind she smiles
TESS (cont’d)
Let’s have some fun

And Tess heads off straight into the storm
EXT THE GLADE - SUNSET
Sam and Charlie are having a catch
SAM
It’s weird to think of mom living

up in Portlandwith a husband and
some step kids

CHARLIE
She’s got a whole new life
SAM
I wonder if she ever even thinks
about me
CHARLIE

Of course she does

SAM
But why live in a place where it
rains all the time and they don’t
even have a major league baseball
team

Then Sam sees something out on the water

SAM (CONTD)
Whoa Cool Did you see that
Lightning

Another flash Charlie sees it

CHARLIE
Do me a favor Sam move away from
that tree

SAM
(laughs )
Charliewhat could happen I’m
already dead

CHARLIE
I don’t careit’s making me
nervous

And Sam gets clear of the tree

CHARLIE
Thank you

EXT QUERENCIAOCEAN - NIGHT
We are in the atomic bomb blast of a gale force storm

Splotches of Phosphorous streak the sky in a stormy fireworks
show

The wind shrieks with savage fury The sea is a mountainous
tumult of swell and foam

And Tess is loving every minute of it Clearly she lives for
this

Tess is dressed in the protective second skin of her orange
survival suit steering from Querencias large open cockpit

She’s shot full of Adrenaline fueled exhilaration as she
surfs the boat down a massive wave

The boat running before the storm has a lot of sail up for
such high winds But Tess is an elite sailor and she is
pushing it

As Querencia hits the trough at the bottom of the wave Tess
is drenched in a deluge of freezing spray

Shaking the water out of her eyes Tess climbs the boat up
the face of another massive wall of water

Suddenly Tink’s voice squawks out of the waterproof cockpit
speakers

TINK (OVER RADIO)
Come in Querencia this is team
leader one come in Querencia
this is team leader one

Swearing under her breath Tess glances guiltily toward the
speakers

As the boat crests another wave the call comes again
TINK (OVER RADIO) (cont’d)
(sing-song)
Oh Te-esswhere are you You’re
pissing me off

Tess smiles She knows she must answer

CLOSE ON A button reading AUTO-PILOT She punches it It
illuminates red

Satisfied that the boat is holding its heading she pushes
back the cabin hatch slams it shut and scoots below

INT CABIN QUERENCIA - NIGHT

In the relative calm of the cabin Tink’s voice clamors from
the radio

TINK (ON RADIO)
Come in Querencia

Tess plucks up the radio handset

TESS(INTO RADIO)
Hey big guy what’s up

INT CARROLL SAILS - NIGHT
Tink is seated at a radio in the makeshift command center
TINK (INTO RADIO)
You tell me What’s happenin’ out
there

INT CABIN QUERENCIA - NIGHT

TESS(INTO RADIO)
Ahhh nothing much

As if reproaching her for her lie the boat free falls off a
wave Tess has to brace to stop being thrown across the
cabin

TESS
Holy shit

TINK’S VOICE
What’s that

Grimacing at her own dishonesty she tries to sound casual
TESS(INTO RADIO)
I said it’s so damned quiet out
hereI’m falling asleep

INT CARROLL SAILS - NIGHT

Tink smiles relieved

TINK (INTO RADIO)
What’s your position

INT CABIN QUERENCIA - NIGHT
Tess quickly glances down at the chart on the table

CLOSE ON The chart Tess traces her finger over the course
Tink plotted

TESS(INTO RADIO)
Ahhh probably just southeast of
the Eagle Island Channel Quit
buggin me I’m gonna get some
shuteye

TINK (ON RADIO)
That makes two of us Over and
out

TESS(INTO RADIO)
Bye Tink

As Tess replaces the handset she is stopped by a sudden
calmness She pauses unsure at first what she is feeling
The howl of the wind has also died She looks out the
porthole and sees why Her blood runs cold

TESS
Oh my God

A HUGE ROGUE WAVE a churning mountain of wind-whipped
seawater so gigantic it seems to loom in slow motion over the
tiny craft

And as Tess leaps for the ladder up to the deck the wave
HITS with unimaginable force and Tess is flung violently
across the cabin

CLOSE ON Tess’s temple strikes a bulkhead with sickening
force

EXT QUERENCIAOCEAN - NIGHT

The demonic shriek of wind through rigging is unbearable
Querencia has been knocked flat by the rogue wave Its sails
now broadside to the wind lie flat in the water The deck is
at right angle

CLOSE ON The AUTO-PILOT button It beeps and flashes with

calamitous warning Next to the AUTO-PILOT button the KEEL
button also flashes a red warning signal

Water floods the cockpit Every breaking wave threatens to
roll the boat

INT CABIN QUERENCIA - NIGHT

CLOSE ON Tess She does not move

SUDDENLY Tess’s eyes flicker open

With superhuman effort she drags herself onto one elbow A
moment of groggy indecision then she grits her teeth hauls

herself to her feet and leaps into action

FOLLOW Tess as she negotiates the crazy horror-house angle
of the companionway and scrambles into the cockpit

EXT QUERENCIAOCEAN - NIGHT

Awash with waves and alive with flailing rigging the
cockpit is a lethal place to be

At any moment Tess could be flung into the raging ocean
Hanging on for dear life she resets the AUTO-PILOT and KEEL
buttons then releases the ropes that hold the jib and

mainsail in place

TESS
Help me dadHelp me please

And just when it looks like it couldn’t get any worse
The wind begins to die down a bit the waves subside a little
toothere’s even a trace of sunlight appearing through the

clouds

And as Tess gets her ship righted she sighs mightily with
relief then says

TESS
Sorry girl let’s go home

And Tess turns the wheel
DISSOLVE INTO
EXT THE CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

Charlie’s making his rounds when he sees something off in the
distance He starts heading toward

TESS AT A GRAVE SITE

She seems to be sleeping her head resting on the cool marble
of her father’s gravestone Charlie is surprised to see her
and given their recent encounter he’s not quite sure what
to do

CHARLIE
Miss Carroll Tess

Tess’s eyes snap open she’s dazed

CHARLIE
Are you okay

Tess gazes around her gradually becoming more present

TESS
Yeah I’m okayI guess I must
have

Only now does Charlie’s face come into full focus for her

TESS
(angry)
You

CHARLIE
(sheepish)
Ummwe meet again

Tess scrambles up to her feet

TESS
Beat it now Before I report you
to whoever’s in charge of this
place

CHARLIE
That would be me

He taps the Waterside Cemetery badge on his shirt Tess is
surprised

TESS
Wellwhat do you know

CHARLIE
I didn’t want to bother you but

Tess is suddenly unsteady on her feet Charlie has to hold
her

CHARLIE
Are you okay Here sit down

Charlie helps her to sit back down on the grass before her

father’s stone

TESS
I hit some rough weather out by the
shoals last night I guess it hit
me back

CHARLIE
Sure you’re okay

TESS
YeahI’m fineThanks

Charlie’s uncomfortable around this beautiful woman even

more so than usual

CHARLIE
Okay then

Charlie starts to leave Then

TESS
Wait
(Charlie stops)
Last nightwhen you were sneaking
around my boatwhat was that all
about

CHARLIE
(embarrassed)
I told you I just wanted to get a
better look at her

TESS
Are you still racing

Charlie just looks at her She smiles

TESS
You were the captain of the sailing
team weren’t you

CHARLIE
YeahI sure was
(then)
NoI don’t race I don’t even
sail anymore

TESS
How come

CHARLIE
(hesitant)
I justdon’t have the time

Tess smiles as she looks around the quiet cemetery

TESS
Guess they really keep you hopping
around here huh

Charlie knows she’s teasing him He smiles

CHARLIE
You’d be surprised

Tess just looks at him remembering

TESS
Didn’t you get a scholarship to

CHARLIE
Dartmouth Yeahbut I ended up
sticking around here

And now Tess puts it together

TESS
I remember nowIt was a drunk
driver wasn’t it
(Charlie nods)
I cried when I heard I cried all
day

Charlie glances at her father’s stone

CHARLIE
I guess you two were pretty close
huh

TESS

(nods toward sea)
Believe it or notit was my dad
who pulled me through out there

CHARLIE
I liked what you read that day
(she looks at him)
At his service It was-

TESS
You were here
CHARLIE
I’m around for most of ‘em

TESS
I was pretty out of it that
dayIt’s from a poem by ee
Cummings called “Dive For Dreams”
(she recites)
“Trust your heart if the seas catch
fire and live

CHARLIE

“Live by love though the stars walk
backward”

(off her look)
I looked it up

(Tess smiles Charlie

laughs)
But I’ve got no idea what it means

TESS

It’s about trusting your heart and
taking chances in your life That
was my dad

(Charlie smiles)
He died of a heart attack Too many
lobster rolls at Kelly’s I’m sure
he’d much rather have been lost at
sea

CHARLIE
(chuckles )
That’s exactly what he said

Tess looks at him Charlie recovers

CHARLIE

Tess is once again unsteady on her feet Charlie steadies
her Then he notices her head

CHARLIE
Youre hurt

She touches her head Charlie stands over her takes a look
CHARLIE

Tess hesitates

CHARLIE

Charlie smiles and leads the way
INT CHARLIE’S COTTAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

They’re in the living room Charlie’s applying some
antibiotic to Tess’s head wound

She’s looking at the dozens of sketches and pictures of
sailboats on Charlie’s wall

TESS
Wowthese are all yours

CHARLIE
(embarrassed)
It’s just a hobby

One sketch in particular catches her eye

TESS
That’s the Querencia

Tess points to an odd shape running the length of the keel

TESS
Don’t tell mewith-

CHARLIE AND TESS
Flukes

They both smile Then

TESS
You seem to have your heart set on
redesigning my boat

CHARLIE
(flustered)
No not at all I just-

TESS
(laughs )
I’m kidding Charlie Actually I’m
flattered that you

Tess notices the sunset tables on the wall

TESS
And what’s this

CHARLIE
(squirming)
That’s just a project I’ve been
working on

TESS
(she’s got no idea)
Interesting

Charlie wants to redirect her attention to his Querencia
sketch

CHARLIE
So what do you think Pretty crazy

TESS

something

CHARLIE
(delighted)
You think so

Tess just looks at Charlie she’s trying to make up her mind
about him Then

TESS
Yes I do And I thinkthat we
should talk about it

Tess is looking right into his eyes The moment stretches
Then Charlie glances at the sunset chartsAnd he pulls back
from Tess

CHARLIE
Wellmaybe when you get back from
sailing around the world

Even though he’s smiling Charlie has pulled back and Tess
can feel it

TESS
Sure
(then)
Okay well thanks for fixing my
head
CHARLIE

My pleasure Itumlooks really
good on you

TESS
Goodbye Charlie

And she’s gone Charlie’s left alone in his cottage which is
suddenly feeling extremelyempty He glances over at the
sketch of Tess’s boat Strong emotions he can’t keep down are
churning

EXT CHARLIE’S COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Charlie explodes out of the cottage He stops looks around
then he takes off running through the cemetery

ON CHARLIE running hard sprinting up a hill Then he sees-
TESS walking along the path up ahead

Charlie smiles and he’s about to run toward her when he
hearsthe sunset cannon Charlie freezes on the hill
conflicted He looks up toward the sun sinking down over the
cemetery woods

Tess is walking down the path when she’s startled by the
sudden appearance of the out-of-breath Charlie who’s run
down from the hill to intercept her

CHARLIE
Tonight

TESS

CHARLIE

Tess smiles as she watches him sprinting through the
cemetery not quite sure what to make of Charlie St
CloudThen she spies Charlie and Sam’s forlorn looking
little sailboat on the beachShe keeps on walking

EXT CLEARING - TWILIGHT

Sam’s sulking Charlie goes to him

CHARLIE

Sam lashes out

SAM
You’re sick and tired of hanging

out with her

Sam’s young and frightened his insecurities are getting the
best of him and it breaks Charlie’s heart

CHARLIE

Charlie looks at his kid brotherwho will never get to kiss
a girl

CHARLIE
Truthfully Sam I can hardly

INT CHARLIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Charlie and Tess are lingering over what seems to have been a
very successful meal

The lights are low RandB pulses from the sound system and
they are both pleasantly tipsy from the bottle of wine that
they’ve emptied

Tess looks over Charlie’s boat sketches laid out on the
table

TESS
Wowyou know you really should
be building these
(he smiles)
This is still my favorite

It’s the sketch of Querencia modified

CHARLIE
Querencia

TESS
It’s Spanish for-

CHARLIE
The place in the ring where the
bull feels safe

TESS

(smiles )
You know your Hemingway

(Charlie smiles)
It’s also the place where we feel
the most secure - It’s where we can
be ourselves

(then)
Where’s yours Charlie Where’s
your Querencia

CHARLIE
Right here I guess

TESS
The cemetery

CHARLIE
(embarrassed)
Marblehead
(she chuckles)

TESS
Come on CharlieI love
Marblehead too butit’s like the

(smiles shakes her head)
You can’t buy a thrill

Charlie’s looking right at her into those sea-green eyes
And Tess is feeling it toothinking maybe you can buy a
thrill after allThen

CHARLIE
Ummwe need more wine

Charlie gets up and heads off into the kitchen

Tess watches him go She smiles still not sure what to make
of him Then she gets up stretches outand gravitates
toward the big messy bookcase It’s filled with an eclectic
assortment- everything from World Lit to Archeology to books
on all matters related to the afterlife But it’s a certain
sailing book that gets her attention it’s lying beneath a
cardboard box on the top shelf She reaches for it trying to
slide it out from beneath the box But the box falls and it’s
contents spill onto the floor -

PHOTOGRAPHS DOZENS OF THEM

We see splashes of images young Charlie Sam and their
mother

INT CHARLIE’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Charlie’s trying to get a bottle of wine open with the
corkscrew But his hand is trembling with nerves He
chastises himself

CHARLIE
Get a grip

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Charlie walks in with the wine bottle Tess doesn’t see him
she’s seated on the floor looking at a photo of a young
Charlie with his mother Charlie doesn’t like being
confronted with these long ago imagesBut he covers it as
he says

CHARLIE
That’s my mom

Tess looks up startled

TESS
Charlie I’m sorry I was reaching
for a book and-

CHARLIE
It’s okay

He bends down and starts putting the pictures back

CHARLIE
When my mom moved up to Portland
we divi’d up the family photos

TESS
I guess you’re not the album

type
(holding a photo)
You andSam right

CLOSE ON PHOTO - YOUNG CHARLIE AND SAM arms around each
other aboard their sailboat mugging for the camera Charlie
has to hide his pain

CHARLIE
We were out at the point

And Charlie quickly starts tossing the photos back into the
box But Tess is fascinated by them Picture after picture of
Sam and Charlie sailing

TESS
Charlie Was Sam the reason

CHARLIE
The reason for what

TESS
The reason you stopped sailing

Charlie just looks at her She sure can press his buttons

TESS
I’m sorry I-

CHARLIE
It’s all right
(then after a beat)
Sam and mewe were gonna sail
around the world too

TESS
(delighted)
You were

And Charlie just starts talking as if in a dream

CHARLIE

Marquesas Tuamoto Zanzibar
Fijiall of those faraway places
that hang off the edge of the map
by their fingernailswe were
gonna see ‘em all

(then)
After the accidentI tried taking
the boat out a few times but

(he shakes his head)

Charlie’s never said these things to anybody Tess takes his
hand

TESS
When I lost my dadI thought I’d
never get over it
(gently)
But we’ve gotta keep going
Charlie

Tess looks deep into Charlie’s eyes

TESS (CONT’D)
“Trust your heart if the seas catch
fire”
(then)
Youve got to take a chance

Then almost imperceptibly Charlie leans toward herTess
barely whispers

TESS
What are you

CHARLIE
Taking a chance

Then in the grip of emotions he’s never before felt Charlie
pulls her into his armsand kisses her with all the
passion longing and tendernessthat his lonely heart
contains

Then it’s over Both of them overwhelmed and unprepared for
the powerful emotions coursing through them

TESS
Timing is everything isn’t it

CHARLIE
What do you-

TESS
I’m leaving in a week remember

Charlie nods grimly Then

TESS
I oughtta go

CHARLIE
Can I walk you Let me-

TESS
(she touches his cheek)
Good night Charlie St Cloud

And Tess walks out the door Charlie’s cottage has never
seemed so empty and his heart is aching Then

A knock at the door Charlie opens it Tess lands in his
arms They’re kissing passionatelyBumping into furniture
tearing off clothes as they make their way into the bedroom
INT CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - DAWN

around He’s alone He’s surprised dismayedAnd then he
sees taped to his mirror-

TESS
(smiling)
I knew youd find me

Charlie starts walking slowly toward the water

TESS

EXT TESS’S MOTHER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

A single light burns high up in the widow’s walk of an
eighteenth century house overlooking the harbor

Tess walks in looks around calls out

TESS

But the house is empty Tess sighs and plops down in the
window seat of the widow’s walk gazes mournfully out over
the dark water

Bobbo trots in He whines pitifully Tess sighs

thin air Suddenly engulfed by sadness his smile fades He
murmurs

CHARLIE (cont’d)

Charlie gulps scotch from the glass in his hand

EXT CHARLIE’S COTTAGE - DAWN

Charlie looking like hell and feeling even worse is just
now discovering that he’s out of coffee He shakes out the
few remaining grounds from the bag

Joe’s standing there with a shit eating grin

JOE

Charlie closes the door in Joe’s face and turns away Joe
opens the door and comes inside

disheveled he is

along the dock He meets a couple of other watermen

EXT ALONG THE WATER

Tess runs down the beach chasing Bobo Up ahead she sees a
FISHERMAN she knows She calls out

TESS
Hey Dubby grab him will you

Dubby makes no attempt to stop the dog and as Tess runs by
she laughs

TESS
Thanks for nothing Dubby

INT THE CAFE -DAY

Charlie’s still watching as Tink and the group enter the cafe
and go to a big wall-sized nautical chart of the area A
couple of the locals drift over and join the group

WAITRESS
So what‘ll it be guys

Charlie gets up and approaches Tink’s group As he nears the
huddle he hears snatches of conversation “Coast Guard
chopper could” “been over forty-eight hours since”
“where was your last contact from”

Through the window we see a distressed Grace Carroll walking
with HODDY SNOW the officious-looking harbor master

EXT ALONG THE WATER - DAY

Tess chases Bobo who’s now heading toward town She’s
getting seriously irritated

TESS

TESS
Julie

No response Tess turns to a mirrored storefront window
seeking her reflection

INT THE DRIFTWOOD - DAY
Charlie is reeling This just can’t be
The men in the group make way for Grace Carroll who’s just
walked in Her face is tear-streaked as she makes her way
through the crowd
GRACE
(to Tink)

The Coast Guard doesn’t have a man

to spare It seems there are some

fishing boats in trouble

Finally Charlie just has to speak up

CHARLIE
This is a mistake

All eyes are on him Tink looks at him disdainfully

TINK
How the hell would you know St
Cloud

CHARLIE
Tess isn’t missing I was with her
yesterday

Everybodys befuddled What’s going on here

GRACE
You were with my daughter

CHARLIE
Yes ma’am I was We had dinner

in over forty-eight hours She’s
out there somewhere She never came

PUSH IN On Charlie desperately holding back fear

Everybody including Joe is shaking their heads
thinkingcrazy Charlie again

EXT MARBLEHEAD MAIN STREET - DAY

We now see what Tess sees in the mirror -- life continuing
around her on the street but no reflection back of herself
Gripped with panic Tess slowly buckles to the pavement

INT THE DRIFTWOOD - DAY

TINK
Anybody with a boat please We
can use all the help we can get
WATERMAN 1

Everybodys aghast Charlie turns and walks out the door
EXT MARBLEHEAD STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Charlie’s rushing down the street looking in all directions

No sign of Tess Then he has a thought He takes off toward
the water

Soonup aheadhe sees her
TESS ON THE DOCK
Her back to Charlie gazing out at the water

CHARLIE
Tess

Tess turns around There’s Charlie rushing toward her And in
less than a moment she’s in his arms

TESS
Charlie thank GodI thought I

CHARLIE
(anguished)
Tess—

TESS
Nobody can see me Charlie Nobody
but you

Tess can tell by Charlie’s face that something is horribly
wrong

TESS
Tell me what’s happeningTell me
I’m real

Charlie knows he has to be strong for her It isn’t easy

A procession of boats motor past the dock on their way out of
the harbor

CHARLIE
(gently)
They’re going out to search for
you
TESS

Search for me But

CHARLIE
When you went out on your test
runyou ran into that storm
frontDo you remember what
happened

And Tess tries her best to concentrate

TESS
I lied to Tink about my position
I remember asking my dad for help
and thenthe next thing I
knewI was there at his grave

Charlie’s having a hard time holding it together

CHARLIE
(hardest words he’s ever
spoken)
When you went out on the
Querenciayou didn’t come back

They look into each other’s eyesCharlie’s heart is
breaking And thenTess begins to slowly fade

CHARLIE
No

TESS
I’m so coldwhy am I so

Tess panics as she realizes what’s happening to her

CHARLIE
Tess hang on

TESS

Charlie tries to hold onto Tess but his hands go right
through her Their faces are inches apart Tess’s voice
drifting far away

CHARLIE
Tess please-

TESS
Come find me

And thenshe’s gone

CHARLIE
No

Tink passes with his boat He’s seen Charlie talking to
himself He turns away with disgust

is

Charlie’s left alone on the dock the mournful foghorn
blows

INT CHARLIE’S COTTAGE - DAY

Charlies wallwith it’s meticulous round trip charts and
sunset tables and dozens of sailboat sketches

PULL BACK TO Charlie standing there staring at them

Then in a rage he rips the charts from the wall tearing
them into pieces and flinging them across the room Next come
his sailboat sketches - one after another he rips them from
the wall But there’s one sailboat sketch that stops him cold-

THE QUERENCIA

It’s the sketch of Charlie’s re-imagined version of Tess’s
boat Charlie can’t bring himself to pull this one from the
wall but the sight of it absolutely breaks his heart

Then he calms down composes himselfHe knows what he has
to do

INT CHARLIE’S COTTAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

Charlie’s at his desk writing a letter

CLOSE ON LETTER - All we see are the words
“DEAR MOM I’M SORRY FOR EVERYTHING” And-
“NOW I’LL BE WITH SAM”
And we are led to the inescapable conclusion that Charlie St
Cloud is planning to take his lifeThenthere’s a knock
on the door Charlie ignores it or tries to Then-

And Charlie walks out of the glade
INT CHARLIE’S COTTAGE - NIGHT

Charlie walks in and surveys the mess he’s made The only
thing still on the wall is his sketch of the Querencia

Then he walks to the desk opens the drawer - he’s looking at-

HIS SUICIDE NOTE

He picks it up and tears it into pieces which he tosses into
the trash Then as he’s about to close the drawerhe sees
something in there it was lying beneath the noteWas it
there before He picks it up

TESS’S HAND DRAWN SAILBOAT PICTURE

It breaks Charlie’s heart to see it Then he turns it over
There are those three words again-

COME FIND ME

Charlie sighs deeply He places the note back in the drawer -
a memento he will forever cherish He closes the drawer and
starts picking up the tattered remains of the charts and
sketches he’d torn off the wall

But he’s stopped cold when lying on the floor he sees-
ANOTHER HAND DRAWN SAILBOAT SKETCH

It’s identical to the other He turns it over Those words
again

COME FIND ME

Charlie is baffledwhere did this second sketch come from
And as he studies it he hearsa sounda ripping sound

He wheels around to see-
THE QUERENCIA SKETCH ON THE WALL

The tape that’s holding it is giving waythe sketch is
slowly starting to peel away

And as it does one by one it reveals the words scrawled
there on the wall

COME FIND ME
The sketch falls onto the floor

Charlie is rocked unable to moveCome find me come find
meand then-

FLASHBACK - ON THE WATER - TESS IN HIS OLD SAILBOAT
TESS

(smiling)
I knew you’d find me

ee

FLASHBACK - THE HARBOR
The last time Charlie saw herfading away

TESS
Come find me Charlie Find me

CHARLIE
(screaming)
Tess

ANOTHER IMAGE - THE ANGUISHED TESS

TESS

THE PRESENT - ON CHARLIE - AN EPIPHANY

CHARLIE
My God

EXT MARBLEHEAD DOCK - NIGHT

The weary-looking Tink’s just tied up his boat He walks up
the dock with the frantic Charlie at his heels

TINK
This morning you said we were
wasting our time

CHARLIE
I was wrong She’s out there
somewhere but she’s running out of
time

TINK
Even with a survival suit the
Coast Guard’s putting her chances
at slim to none

CHARLIE
Tink-

TINK
We’re going back out in the
morning

Charlie grabs his arm

CHARLIE
If you won’t go then lend me your
boat

Tink snorts “Yeah right” pulls away and keeps on walking
leaving Charlie behind Charlie doesn’t miss a beat He turns
around and makes a dash for Tink’s boat He quickly unties it
and leaps aboard

ON TINK’S BOAT - CONT
Charlie rushes into the wheel house and starts the engine
ON TINK

Hearing his boat engine start up He wheels around sees
what’s happening and charges toward his boat like an angry
bull

TINK
Sonavabitch

ON THE BOAT
Charlie’s at the wheel moving her out of the slip
TINK LEAPS OFF THE DOCK

And just barely makes it onto the boat He scrambles to his
feet and attacks Charlie shoving him roughly up against the
wall Charlie tries to break free but Tink’s too big and
strong Tink then lifts Charlie up and hurls him across the
wheel houseeverything goes flying including the radio
which gets smashed on the floor

Tink’s coming for him again Charlie scrambles up Tink’s
coming toward him with murder in his eyes

CHARLIE
Go on throw me overboard I’1l get
another boat And another one if I
have to

Tink stops he bellows half in anguish half in anger

TINK
You don’t even know her

CHARLIE
I know she sailed into the storm
not around it I know youve been
searching in the wrong goddamn
place

TINK
How do you know

CHARLIE
(thinking fast)
A week before the racewouldn’t
she want to test her boat in heavy
weather Maybe you’re the one who
doesn’t know her

Despite himself Tink sees the logic of thisStill he
glowers at Charlie as he says

TINK
The first time I catch you talking
to somebody that I cannot
seeyou’re going in the water

Charlie nods
EXT TINK’S BOAT - NIGHT

Tink’s boat threads slowly through a chain of small islands
that arc out of the sea like humpbacks

The boat’s powerful searchlight sweeps an eerily calm ink-
black ocean

Tink’s at the wheel as Charlie manning the searchlight
calls out

CHARLIE
Tess Tess

His voice bounces forlornly back from the rocks
EXTINT TINK’S BOAT - DAWN

Charlie and Tink have been up all night and it shows In the
cabin Charlie’s poring over the nautical maps while Tink
tries to get the broken radio to work

TINK
Come in Coast Guard Coast Guard
can you hear me Come in Coast
Guard

Tink releases the talk button and gets only static He
finally gives up

CHARLIE
How are we on gas

TINK
Getting low We can refuel and pick
up some sandwiches at Portsmouth
Tink yawns mightily

CHARLIE
You wanna grab some sleep

TINK
NoI’m good

EXT OCEANTINK’S BOAT - DAY

Tink is sound asleep Charlie is at the tiller scanning the
horizon He can’t see shit it’s foggy as hell

CHARLIE
Where are you Tess Where are
you

SAME SCENE - LATER

Charlie weary running on fumes still at the wheel Now
Charlie’s got his eye on-

THE HAZY YELLOW SUN

Tink walks over sees Charlie watching the sun He hands him
a beer

CHARLIE
Thanks

TINK
When that sun goes down it’s gonna
be like sailing through a tunnel

Charlie’s not thinking about the darkness he’s thinking
about Sam as he says

CHARLIE
We’1l find her And we’1l be back
before the sun goes down
Charlie wants to believe this with all his heart
ON THE BOAT - LATER

Tink steers toward a small island Charlie calls out

CHARLIE
Tess Tess

No reply Charlie dares to glance skyward-
THE SUN IS JUST STARTING TO SINK
Charlie’s getting desperate

CHARLIE
Head for Shark’s Bay

Tink shakes his head but he turns the wheel
INT THE BOAT CABIN - LATER
Tink’s trying the radio again

Charlie’s going over the navigational maps and charts
crossing out the areas that have already been searched

CHARLIE
Shark’s Bay Pilot Rock Boon
Island Cape
PorpoiseNewburyport
(fervent)
That just leaves

TINK
(frustrated)
It leaves about one hundred square
miles of-

Charlie gets up and heads for the deck

CHARLIE
I know where she is

EXT THE DECK - LATE AFTERNOON

Charlie’s at the wheel with Tink The water’s getting
rougher the boat’s unsteady the cold sea sweeps the deck
and both men have to shout above the din of the waves

TINK
Mingo Rock That’s gotta be twenty
miles out

CHARLIE
She hit some rough weather out by
the shoals Mingo Rock is the last
place-

TINK
How do you know she-
CHARLIE
Because that’s what she said

TINK
(angry laugh)
That’s what she said And when
exactly did she-

Charlie realizes he slipped up

CHARLIE
You’re gonna have to trust me on-

TINK
(ordering)
Turn her around

CHARLIE
Tink

TINK
We can still get back before
dark

Charlie instinctively looks up at the sun
It’s starting to sink

He could still make it back for Sam

His hands are unsteady on the wheel

He turns back to Tink

CHARLIE
We’re not going in

Tink just snorts and makes a move toward the wheel

blocks him gets in his face

CHARLIE
How are you gonna feel when they
find her Tink When they find her
dead at Mingo Rock

This stops Tink He just glares at CharlieThen

TINK
Youd better be right St Cloud
Or its gonna be you they find at
Mingo Rock

Tink storms away Charlie looks back at the sun

Charlie

SAME SCENE - LATER
THE SUN IS SETTING - DROPPING INTO THE OCEAN

Charlie’s still at the wheel staring off at the sun He
murmurs softly

CHARLIE
Sam

EXT THE GLADE - SUNSET

Sam sitting on a log waiting He tosses his ball in the air
and catches it

ON THE BOAT - SUNSET

Charlie’s on the deck He stares out at the big orange sun
sinking into the sea After thirteen years and thousands of
sunsets Charlie registers the enormity of his decision And
then the tears start to come

EXT VARIOUS SHOTS AROUND THE GLADE - SUNSET

As the last of the sun’s light bathes it in amber

The pond empty and still

The grassy areavacant

And the log Sam was sitting onHe sits there no longer
Then as the CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE GLADEWe find-

SAM ON THE BLUFF

Looking out to seaand just beginning to fade away

BACK ON THE BOAT

Charlie a tear streaming down his cheek as he watches the
last of the sunset

CHARLIE
Goodbye Sam

Then

TINK (0S)
We should be coming up on it

Charlie turns to Tink

CHARLIE
Yeah

Q

LOSE ON The bow of Tink’s boat ploughing through the water

Q

UT TO The bridge Charlie and Tink look out in expectation
as the boat rounds an island

CLOSE ON Charlie He silently prays as

CHARLIE’S POV The island clears from view and He sights-
QUERENCIAS CAPSIZED HULL

He does not know whether to feel joy or despair Querencia
wallows on the gentle swell like an upturned bloated
carcass Wedged between two small islands the boat’s keel is
partially snapped off

Tink is amazed horrified and ecstatic

TINK
God damnHow did you

Snapping into action Charlie barks at Tink

CHARLIE
Take the wheel

Tink grabs the wheel as Charlie starts pulling off his shoes

TINK
What the hell-

CHARLIE
Get as close as you can

TINK
That water’s freezing You’1ll kill
yourself

Charlie runs to the bow of the boat He pauses staring at
Querencia’s stricken hull

He murmurs a silent prayer
And then
WIDE Charlie dives

UNDERWATER SHOT An explosion of phosphorescence as Charlies
body shatters the silent shimmering underwater world

He arrows down toward the inverted entrance of Querencia’s
cabin

Charlie reaches the storm board which seal the cabin’s
entrance

He tries to budge the board It will not move
CLOSE ON He struggles desperately with the board WE HEAR
the sound of his blood drumming in his ears He is running

out of air

Turning on his back Charlie uses his feet to kick the storm-
board with all his might

CLOSE ON It budges

With redoubled fury Charlie kicks The board slides far
enough for Charlie to wriggle into the opening

FOLLOW Charlie into
INT QUERENCIA CABIN - DAY

Gasping Charlie surfaces into the air pocket of the upturned
cabin The water is chest deep

A slice of sunlight penetrates from where the keel has come
away from the hull otherwise the cabin is dark as a tomb

The eerily amplified sound of the boat’s hull grinding
against rocks fills our ears

Charlie calls

CHARLIE
Tess

He takes the pencil light from his pocket and tears it from
its plastic wrapping

Snapping the light on Charlie casts its beam around the
cabin

Everything is literally turned upside down

Packets of food maps clothing and a mess of other junk
floats in the water

CLOSE ON Charlie He cannot see Tess With rising urgency
he scans the beam into every nook and cranny of the cabin

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Tess Tess

And then he sees her unconscious and almost hidden Tess is
wedged into the corner of the far bulkhead

With a cry of relief Charlie rushes through the water toward
the woman he loves

CHARLIE (cont’d)
Tess

With four steps Charlie is there He reaches to take Tess in
his arms but stops horrified

CHARLIE’S POV It is not Tess The dark shape was a sail bag
a trick of the shadows

CUT TO Charlie He is starting to panic

UNDERWATER SHOT Charlie plunges beneath the water that fills
the cabin Fearing the worst now he is looking for a corpse

Nothing
Charlie resurfaces for air and dives back under

CHARLIE’S UNDERWATER POV The cabin skylight has been
punctured by the ship’s boom which still attached to the
broken mast protrudes in from the sea at an unlikely angle
The hole seems to have been enlarged to a size big enough for
a person to fit through

Charlie surfaces He is still for a moment trying to
understand what it means

And with a huge lung-full of air plunges back under he
water

Dawn slanting down through the shifting sea makes the
broken skylight seem like the entrance to a bright white
light-filled tunnel

Charlie swims out of the cabin window and into the light
Charlie is now back under the open sea but on the island
side of Querencia’s hull The broken mast is jammed into

rocks at the base of the island

Charlie swims past a mess of twisted rigging searching for a
sign of Tess

He looks up toward the sunlight He can see the outline of
the island flickering above him

He kicks hard for the surface but moves only a few inches
He tries to move again but cannot He glances around trying
to find what is holding him

CLOSE ON Charlie’s pullover is snagged on some broken
rigging

Charlie twists trying to unhook himself He cannot

CLOSE ON Charlie He has been submerged a long time now His
breath is starting to run out

More and more desperately Charlie twists and struggles
He tries to take the pullover off but it tangles around him

Bubbles escape from his mouth he cannot hold on any longer
He screws his eyes tight with the effort of holding the stale
air inside his bursting lungs

And then

To his great surprise Charlie is suddenly pulled free by
unseen hands He rips out of the jumper and shoots to the
surface

BANG Breaking the surface Charlie gratefully gulps air He
looks around expectantly for his savior

CHARLIE
Tink Tink are you

But Charlie’s alone Charlie doesn’t understandB ut
then he thinks he doesand he smiles gratefully

On one side the upturned hull of Querencia blocks Charlie’s
view of Tink’s boat On the other side is the island

Charlie barely conscious struggles to his feet His eyes
hardly able to focus search the rough black rock And then
he sees ita flash of orange

There Clad in her orange survival suit Tess lies very still
amongst the rocks

CHARLIE
(weakly hardly a whisper)
Tess

EXT MARBLEHEAD WATERFRONT - MORNING

There are a lot of Marblehead residents gathered out here
tonight to keep vigil We see Tink Grace Fraffie Chapman
Marge and many others

And there’s a TV crew on hand doing a story on Tess and her

REPORTER
Mrs Carroll I know it’s a
terrible time for you but-

GRACE
This isn’t a wake young man My
daughter is alive Maybe you’1ll do
another story on her after she

Grace turns and walks away from the reporter leaving him
looking a little foolish

Thenfrom behind the crowdwe just about make out a flash
of orange heading slowly toward the crowd

Marge is the first to see it she can only gasp and say

MARGE
Oh my God

Now they all see what Marge has seen-
CHARLIE CARRYING TESS IN HIS ARMS

sadly and sits down on the log
CHARLIE

VOICE (0S)

BUT CHARLIE DOESN’T HEAR THE VOICE
NOR DOES HE SEE-

THE HANDSOME YOUNG MAN STANDING BEFORE HIM - SHIMMERING LIKE
A HOLOGRAM

And he’s no longer twelve he’s all grown up - a perfect

combination of the boy he’d been and the man he’d always
hoped to be

CHARLIE CAN NEITHER SEE NOR HEAR HIM

And with that Charlie takes his last long look around the
glade

And he starts to walk away
As Sam watches him go he reaches into his jacket pocket for
something

Charlie’s nearing the woods but he stops in his tracks as he
sees

A BASEBALL

Rolling into his field of vision from behind He picks the
baseball up Is he dreaming this He turns around

There’s nothing there Not even Sam’s hologram

the ball in the air and catches it Then

Heading off for a sail around Marblehead
