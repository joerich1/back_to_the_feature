SOFT COPY

EXT SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST - DAY
BEGIN TITLES OVER

It is early morning and already hot INSECTS drone crackle
and scurry for shade PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun
We can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the Earth

On a dusty highway a pair of VULTURES dine on a dead coyote
One of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of
the carcass

In the distance where a long dusty road meets the horizon a
small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang
convertible its top down Its candy-apple red burns like a
brilliant fireball under the sun As the car drifts closer we
see steam escaping from under the hood Sammi Smiths Please
Help Me Get Through The Night plays on the cars radio

INT BOBBY COOPERS MUSTANG - DAY

At the wheel ignoring impending disaster BOBBY COOPER young
good-looking fiddles with the RADIO dial annoyed only to find
country stations Hes been driving since noon yesterday and it
shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the
steering wheel He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing
Pumpkins and he cranks it He pops a Percodan with his good hand
as in the shimmering distance ahead he sees black shapes in
the road and lays on the horn

BOBBY
Get off the goddamn road

EXT DESERT ROAD - DAY

As the MUSTANG powers by the VULTURES move off the shoulder
silently watching

INT MUSTANG - DAY

The RADIO blares as BOBBY fights to stay awake His attention is
caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane He
sits up as the POLICE CAR (SHERIFF POTTER inside) closes
quickly The SIREN starts faintly then SCREAMS as the cruiser
roars past at speed

BOBBY
Fuck you

There is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick
cloud of steam now pours from the hood The temperature gauge
now starts rising

BOBBY
NoNot nowShit

A couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction
buffetting the Mustang with their air waves

EXT FORK IN THE ROAD - DAY

The car rolls into a fork in the road limping with the droop of
an animal that wont make another hundred yards

One sign on the larger road says GLOBE is 29 miles away The
other sign on the lesser road tells us SUPERIOR is only 2
miles A third sign confirms his destiny with Gas Food 1
Mile

BOBBY seems to have no choice He aims the car down the lesser
road towards Superior Arizona

EXT OUTSKIRTS SUPERIOR - DAY

The car rattles on its last legs as BOBBY mutters incantations
noticing a old ghostlike MINING COMPANY at the base of the
mountains overlooking the TOWN Its deserted now no one
visible the gates shut but in its vast dark bulk we sense
the ancient richness and power of this town Bobby moves on
EXT HARLINS GARAGE - DAY

Down the road from the MINING COMPANY BOBBYS CAR pulls into a
small GAS STATION made of weather-beaten wood its windows long
since dusted over The pumps themselves look to have been
manufactured in the early fifties Above the station is a sign
so faded its barely readable HARLINS

Bobby gets out of the car and with great care favoring his
bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain
he opens the hood A plume of steam hits him in the face

BOBBY
Oh shit

Bobby looks around for someone anyone After a few moments he
reaches into the car and blows the horn He waits then blows
it again From out of the station walks DARRELL - a
slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty He
looks the part of a yokel

BOBBY
You Harlin

DARRELL
Nope Darrell

BOBBY
Harlin around

DARRELL
Hes up at the Look Out

Darrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance

BOBBY
Will he be back soon

DARRELL
Doubt it Hes dead The Look Outs a
cemetery

BOBBY

You own this place

DARRELL
Yep

BOBBY
Then why do you call it Harlins
DARRELL
Cause Harlin used to own it

BOBBY
But hes dead

DARRELL
So

Bobby is confused but chooses to drop the matter

BOBBY
You want to take a look at my car I think
the radiator hose is--

DARRELL
Damn Gonna be another hot one today
Sometimes I dont even want to get out of
bed Course dont want to get out for the
cold ones neither Then of course the
clouds come in

Darrell mops his brow with a greasy rag It doesnt so much
wipe the sweat as it does streak his forehead with dirt

BOBBY
Look Harlin Ive got places to be

DARRELL
Darrell--
BOBBY
OK Darrell Could you just take a look

at my radiator hose Its busted

Darrell is clearly upset at being cut off He leans into the
car and looks at the engine

BOBBY
So
DARRELL
Its your radiator hose Its busted
BOBBY
I know its busted What did I just tell
you
DARRELL

Well you know so much why dont you just
fix it yourself
BOBBY
If I could do you think Id be standing
here wasting my time Can you fix it or
do I have to go somewhere else

DARRELL
Somewhere else Mister somewhere else is
fifty miles from here Only other gas
station down in town closed 3 years ago
when the mine got shut

BOBBY
Okay Im stuck You happy Now can you
fix it or not

DARRELL
Yeah I can fix it

BOBBY
Great

DARRELL
Gotta run over to the yard and see if I can
find a hose like this one or close enough
Gonna take time

BOBBY
How much time

DARRELL
Time

BOBBY (rewinds his watch)
What time is it now

DARRELL
Twenty-after-ten

BOBBY
Jesus Twenty-after-ten and it must be
ninety already

DARRELL
Ninety-two Course half hour from now
might be seventy-two These clouds move
around a lot

Bobby wipes the bandaged hand across his forehead

DARRELL
What happened to your hand
Self-consciously Bobby quickly drops his hand to his side

BOBBY
Accident

DARRELL
You got to be more careful Hands is
important Let me show you something When
I was a kid now I dont know if you can
still see it but I gashed my fingers ina
lawnmower

BOBBY
Im very interested in this but is there
someplace

DARRELL
Diner up a piece Not much but us simple
folk like it

BOBBY
Ill be back in a couple of hours And be
careful with her will you

Darrell slams down the hood

DARRELL
Just a car

Bobby reaches into the car pulls out a small ugly gym bag which
he slings onto his shoulder and moves to the trunk pops it open

BOBBY
Its not just a car Its a sixty-four and
half Mustang convertible Thats the
difference between you and me and why you
live here and Im just passing through

The trunk lid rises in the air partially blocking Bobby from
Darrell acting as a partition between them

BOBBY
Now do you mind I got to get some stuff
out of the trunk

He throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint spits
grotesquely into the dirt scratches his nuts and walks back
to the shack

Concealed by the trunk lid Bobby pulls out a GUN (a 9mm black
Baretta) wrapped in a t-shirt from the top of the bag Perhaps
we see a flash of green money lots of it Sports pages and
betting sheets are piled inside With a look around Bobby takes
the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk
Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat There is a small
travel bag from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan
quickly taking two as well as the sports page

INT HARLINS GARAGE - DAY

DARRELL watches out of the darkened office through the front
window as BOBBY slams the trunk and starts walking down the
road with the bag on his shoulder

EXT DESERT ROAD - LATER

BOBBY walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign
saying SUPERIOR - HOME OF THE GOLDEN DOOR RETIREMENT
COMMUNITY As he walks on a pair of MOTORCYCLERS roar past on
their Harleys blanketing him in a cloud of DUST He shouts
after them but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle
engines

EXT SUPERIOR MAIN STREET - DAY

BOBBY hits town such as it is The Freeway left here a few
years back There are only a few little stores A general
store a catalog outlet a post office that doubles as a bus
depot All of them built for the desert heat The busiest spot
in town seems to be the truckstopdiner with a few 18 wheelers
parked outside it

At the corner of one street sits an old BLIND MAN dressed in
raggedy clothes perhaps an Indian His SEEING-EYE DOG lies next
to him Hes talking to TWO OLD MEN veterans perhaps Indian or
Spanish They both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive
alcoholic looks as Bobby passes The Blind Man yells out in an
American Indian accent

BLIND MAN
Hey You there

BOBBY
You want something old man

BLIND MAN
Dont call me old man Aint you got
no respect boy

BOBBY
You want something

BLIND MAN
Yeah I want something I want you to run
over to that machine and get me a pop

BOBBY
You cant do that yourself

BLIND MAN
Hell no I cant do that myself Im
blind Cant you see that

BOBBY
Im sorry I didnt--

BLIND MAN
Whatd you think I was doing out here
with these glasses on Sunnin myself

BOBBY
I dont know I thought you were keeping
the sun out of your eyes

BLIND MAN
I aint got no eyes You want to see

BOBBY
Christ no

BLIND MAN
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam Lost them
fighting the commies Fought the war and
lost my eyes fightin the commies just so
you can come around here and make fun of
me

BOBBY
I said I was sorry

BLIND MAN
Dont be sorry Just run over there and
get me my pop before I die of thirst

BOBBY
Yeah sure You got change

BLIND MAN
Change You want my change I fought the
war and lost my eyes just so I could give
you my change

BOBBY
All right old man Christ

Bobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine it has
bottles instead of cans The blind man shouts to Bobby

BLIND MAN
Get me a Dr Peppa I dont want no Colas
Colas aint nothing but flavored water

Bobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of Dr
Pepper He starts back to the blind man

BLIND MAN

Dont forget to open it for me I cant be
opening my own bottle

BOBBY
Christ

Bobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle then walks
back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground

BLIND MAN
A little for Mother Earth Im about fifty
percent Indian you know To all our
relations

He takes a hearty swig of the soda

BLIND MAN
Ah Just what I needed Want some

The blind man holds the bottle out to Bobby A string of saliva
runs from his lips to the bottles neck

BOBBY
Ill pass

Bobby reaches down and pets the old mans dog Flies buzz around
both the dog and the Blind Man

BOBBY
I think youd better give your pooch a sip

He looks sick

BLIND MAN
Thats cause hes dead

Bobby jumps back

BOBBY
Oh Jesus

BLIND MAN
I hope you wasnt pettin him none was
you

BOBBY

What the hell are you keeping a dead dog

around for

BLIND MAN

BLIND MAN

(as Bobby moves away) Ill see ya later

unless I come across something worse

Bobby noticing a beautiful woman down the street GRACE McKENNA
compulsively turns and catches up to her She is dressed better
than the usual t-shirts and tank tops of this town -- perhaps a

mail-ordered dress or a mothers hand-me-down

With her raven

hair and caramel skin it is obvious she is Native American Her
arms are full with an awkward package she can barely manage

BOBBY
Can I give you a hand beautiful

GRACE
Im just going to my car

BOBBY
Thats right on my way

GRACE

My mother told me never to accept offers

from strangers

BOBBY

My name is Bobby Now Im not a stranger
anymore See how easy it is for us to get

to know each other beautiful
GRACE
Do you have to call me that

BOBBY
I dont know your real name

GRACE
Maybe I dont want you to

Grace stops walking

BOBBY
Maybe but if you didnt I think you would
have kept on walking

GRACE
Youre pretty full of yourself arent you

BOBBY
I like that about me beautiful

GRACE
Its Grace

BOBBY
May I carry your package Grace

Grace hesitates then gives the package to Bobby He has
trouble with it himself

BOBBY
Jesus

GRACE
You sure you can manage

BOBBY
I got it

GRACE
Do you want me to carry your pack for you

Bobby blurts out emphatically

BOBBY
No

He catches himself and softens a bit

BOBBY
No Ive got it
GRACE
What happened to your hand

BOBBY
Accident

GRACE
You should be more careful

They start walking towards Graces car

GRACE
Its very nice of you to help me That
package is kind of heavy and its so hot

BOBBY
No trouble at all really

They get to a car and Bobby puts down the package

Bobby takes up the package and they begin walking again

BOBBY
Wasnt nothing

GRACE
Oh this isnt my car Its down a ways
I should have parked closer I just didnt
think it would be so heavy I could drive
up

BOBBY
Thats all right I got it

package seems to have gained weight

Bobby struggles with the package

face

GRACE
Its just new drapes and curtain rods If
I had known it was going to be so heavy I
would have had them delivered up to the
house

BOBBY (panting)
That a fact

GRACE
I just got tired of looking at the old
drapes My mother made them Had them long
as I can remember You ever seen something
and just knew you had to have it

The

Sweat starts to sheet his
BOBBY (straining)
Yes I have

GRACE
Course they cost a little more than I
should really be spending But damn it I
dont hardly ever do anything nice for
myself I deserve nice things

BOBBY (can hardly talk)
Io cant argue

They arrive at a JEEP SAHARA
GRACE
This is it
Bobby practically drops the package He is covered with sweat

GRACE
Thank you Bobby

BOBBY
Youre welcome Grace

GRACE
Youre not from around here are you

BOBBY
Why you say that Just because I help a
lady with her package

GRACE
You dont have that dead look in your eyes
like the only thing you live for is to get
through the day

BOBBY
I just drove in this morning

GRACE
Drove into Superior What for

BOBBY
Didnt have a choice My car overheated up
the road

GRACE

Youre lucky you didnt break down in the
desert Day like today youd be dead in no
time When you leaving
BOBBY
Not until my cars fixed I dont know how
long thats going to take

GRACE
And here Ive made you all hot and sweaty

Grace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest She
rubs away some of the sweat They look at each other a beat A
POLICE CAR seen earlier pulls up beside them from behind and
idles SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is a weathered handsome
middle-aged man with suspicious eyes black haired in contrast
to Bobbys sandiness

SHERIFF
Morning Grace

GRACE
Morning Sheriff Got my drapes

SHERIFF
Well its about time Looks like you found
yourself a helper too

Bobby wants to shrink behind the drapes

GRACE
Well he offered and I just couldnt
refuse His car overheated

SHERIFF

Bobby turns to the Sheriff and forces a smile

BOBBY
Morning officer

SHERIFF

Son

(beat to Grace)
Little excitement out at the reservation

up drinking all night and then Wayne starts
chasing Dale around the desert with his
shotgun BIA handled it I went by for

GRACE

SHERIFF
Hell no That Wayne cant shoot when hes
sober much less drunk Hes lucky he

(beat)
Well anyhow you stay cool Nice meeting

The Sheriff drives on Pause They look at each other

GRACE
Well I guess I could use some help

Bobby considers the offer but theres not much considering to
do

BOBBY
Well I could use something cool

EXT DESERT ROAD - DAY
BOBBY rides along with GRACE in her JEEP

GRACE

GRACE

BOBBY
Cooper Bobby Cooper Oh you know whatever

GRACE
I never played tennis You just travel
around Bobby-- no direction no steady
work You must like taking chances

BOBBY
If youre going to gamble might as well
play for high stakes

GRACE
What happens when you lose

BOBBY
I pack up and go somewhere else

GRACE (wistfully)
Somewhere else Ive never been anywhere
else Just once Years ago Went to the
State Fair It was nice but it wasnt
nothing

BOBBY
I couldnt stay in this place I wouldnt
Id just pick up do whatever I had to do
and get out

Grace looks to Bobby and smiles

GRACE
Sometimes I feel the exact same way

INT GRACES BEDROOMBATHROOM - LATER - DAY

BOBBY naked steps into the shower and turns on the water It
shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body As the
water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice

VOICE (VO)
I want my money

Bobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady
himself His hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his
pinky or ring finger Bobby leans back in the shower Just as
he does
EXT ALLEY - NIGHT

It is raining hard Matching the backwards motion of the last
scene BOBBY is thrown violently against a brick wall facing
out

VOICE (VO)
I want my money
BOBBY
Look Ill get the money You dont want to

do this

VOICE (VO)
Take two for now One a week punk

Bobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular GOONS
Another MAN stands partially hidden behind the goons frame
With one hand one goon flattens Bobbys hand against the brick
with his other he clips two fingers off with a GARDEN SHEAR We
see Bobbys face in agonizing pain then he slides screaming to
the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men

As Bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks
down his ashen blank face

INT GRACES BEDROOMBATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We see BOBBYs face reliving the experience as once again we
hear the voice

VOICE (VO)
Two weeks asshole Get the money or you
gonna lose your nose and ears

Bobby has slumped to the floor of the shower looking to his
left hand almost crying unable to tolerate it As a streak of
blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring
FINGERS have been cut off at the joints

INT GRACES BEDROOMBATHROOM - DAY
BOBBY his hand rebandaged is putting on his clothes

BOBBY (to himself)
Youre still lucky

As he does he looks at himself in the mirror He bends to pick
up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag As he lifts it we
can see perhaps more closely than at the garage that the bag is
34 filled with money He closes the bag and stands In the
MIRROR hidden in the doorway he sees GRACE watching him Bobby
slows perceptibly but does not try to hide himself After a
moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade

GRACE
Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade

fq

Bobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down He rubs the glass
against his forehead

BOBBY
Thats good Cools you right off
(tentatively) I saw you watching me

fq

GRACE
m sorry I didnt mean to

BOBBY
didnt say it bothered me

GRACE
Did you like it me watching you

BOBBY
I guess Ive got an ego same as any man

GRACE
Good cause I liked what I saw

Bobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant Grace slides
an ice cube from the glass between her lips He notices a framed
picture of GRACE and an OLDER MAN

BOBBY
Nice place

GRACE
Thank you

Grace sits on the edge of the bed Bobby indicates the picture
ironic

BOBBY
Whos that your father

GRACE (without much thought)
Stepfather

BOBBY (coy)
Got a boyfriend

GRACE
No Not really
Bobby senses shes lying but plays along

BOBBY
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living
by herself in a big house

GRACE
I guess it must

BOBBY
What do you do anyway

GRACE
A little of this a little of that Mostly
I tell fortunes

BOBBY
Whered you learn to do that

GRACE
From my father He was the tribes shaman

BOBBY
A medicine man

GRACE
Those are white words not ours

BOBBY
Nice house for a shamans daughter You
must be good

GRACE
Come here

Bobby goes to Grace and kneels before her She takes his head
in her hands and looks deep into his eyes Her voice goes
thick but soft like a morning fog

GRACE
Theres something in your past something
you want to keep hidden Theres a pain
Something someone you cant forget
And there is something you want very badly
It seems very far away to you but you are
determined and you will do what you must
to get it

Bobby closes his hands on Graces and takes them from his face
He is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of Graces
reading

BOBBY
My face tell you all that

GRACE
It tells me what every face tells me
Everybody has a past they have a pain and
they have something they want
(seductively) What is it you want

BOBBY
The same thing you do

They silently stare into each others eyes

GRACE
Really I want to hang drapes

Grace walks from the room For a moment Bobby stares after her
He takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his
teeth

INT GRACES LIVING ROOM - DAY

GRACE is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes
BOBBY notices a photo of Grace with an older INDIAN WOMAN her
mother

GRACE
Hold me

Bobby stands behind her gently places his hands on Graces
waist

GRACE
Tighter I wont break You know girls are
a lot tougher than men think

Bobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes His
eyes are transfixed on her ass

GRACE
There All done Lift me down

BOBBY
What

GRACE
Lift me down

Bobby lifts Grace down from the ladder He holds her his hands
around her waist

GRACE

You can let go of me now Im safe

a wicked smile) How do they look

BOBBY
Like you

GRACE
Beautiful

BOBBY (kidding)
Like theyre made of polyester

GRACE

I like them I was sick of looking at this

(with

room I think they add a little life

BOBBY
Nothing like a little liveliness

With a sexy pout Grace loads the next question

GRACE

No more drapes to hang Now what should

we do

BOBBY
I have an idea

GRACE
And what would that be

Bobby steps close to Grace and takes her by the shoulders

pulls her to him and presses his lips hard to hers

doesnt respond

BOBBY
All right Grace No more games

GRACE (innocently)
Games

BOBBY

You flirt with me then you run cold
lead me on then slap me down I dont go

for being jerked around

GRACE

Really And what game did you want to

play You carry my box for me and I fall

You

Grace

He
into bed with you
Bobby grabs up his pack

BOBBY
I think I can find my own way back to
into town

GRACE
Maybe I like to find out about a man first
Maybe I like to know what hes made of

BOBBY
Im just flesh and blood baby That anda
few memories of bad women just like most
guys But you already know that You read
my mind remember Thanks for the lemonade

Bobby turns to leave

GRACE
You never did answer my question

BOBBY
Still playing

GRACE
Thats not an answer What is it you want

BOBBY
You know what I want

GRACE
Maybe I just want to hear you say it

For a beat Bobby stands and stares hard at Grace His pack
slides from his shoulder and thuds on the floor With great
determination like a beast closing for the kill Bobby moves
for her Grace stands firm ready for him her head tilts back
Her breath comes deep and hard

Just as Bobby is about to reach her just as he is about to take
her he is stopped dead by the booming voice of JAKE McKENNA

JAKE (0S)
Grace

Bobby turns to face Jake An older man still large and
formidable for his age

GRACE (nonplussed)
Jake I thought you
JAKE
Who the hell is this

BOBBY

JAKE

BOBBY (shocked whisper)

JAKE

at it coolly

BOBBY

JAKE

JAKE (opens the door)

Bobby glares back at Grace who gives him a maddening little
smile

BOBBY
You people are crazy

He storms out holding his nose

EXT DESERT ROAD - LATER - DAY
BOBBY holding a handkerchief to his nose which has stopped
bleeding hauling his bag on his shoulder walks back to town
along the side of the road Already he is caked with a mixture
of sweat and dust looking up at the relentless sun that beats
down on him

BOBBY
Fuckin shithole

A CADILLAC slows beside him JAKE driving

BOBBY
What the fuck do you want

JAKE

JAKE

little place like this would just be a dot
on a map to you after awhile

BOBBY

your wife If I had known she was
married--

JAKE
It wouldnt have made a difference to you

BOBBY
Wait a second--

JAKE
Ah I can smell it on you

Jake wipes his hand across the back of Bobbys neck and holds it
to his nose

BOBBY
Hey

JAKE
Thats the sweat of a man who hasnt an
honest bone in his body Dont be
offended lad A man whos got no ethics
is a free man I envy that Beside how
can I blame you That Grace sure has a
mind of her own and a body to match dont
she Eh

Jake nudges Bobby who smiles a nervous smile

JAKE
She does at that I knew when I married
her she was a free spirit A woman with
her looks and a man my age what was I to
expect But you see a woman like that in a
town like this and you dont think you do
So I married her What are you to do eh

Jake looks at Bobby his lips curled into a sly smile

JAKE
You cant shoot em I like that

she Taking you up to the house to hang
drapes Oh thats a good one Bet she had
you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your
face I bet you just wanted to pull down
her pants and hog her out Then me busting
in like some wild bear Ha Bet you had a
fire going under you

BOBBY
Like you dont know

JAKE
Mad like a dog in heat I bet you were I
can tell you got a temper on you

Bobby gives a little laugh

JAKE
Bet you just wanted to snap her neck right

then didnt you Bet you just wanted to
kill her

Bobby starts to laugh heartily Jake joins in then stops
abruptly

JAKE
Would you

BOBBY
Would I what

JAKE
Would you kill her

Bobby starts to laugh Bobby stops laughing

JAKE
Because Im sick and tired of her little
games Because you could do it and drift
away on your boat and no one would ever see
you again Because Ive got a
fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy
on her and I would be more than happy to
give the man who does her in a good chunk
of it

For a moment Bobby sits in silence not sure of what to make of
the offer

BOBBY
Ive done a few things but Im not a
murderer Mr McKenna

JAKE
How do you know if youve never tried
BOBBY
This is a joke right You just want to
rattle me Right

They reach town and Jake stops the car near a small GROCERY
STORE

JAKE
Thats right Nothing but a joke Thats
all

Bobby gets out of the car With a big smile Jake says

JAKE
Enjoy your stay lad

Jake speeds away Bobby looks after him

BOBBY
Who are these people

INT SMALL GROCERY STORE - LATER

The store is small and dark and empty save for a tiny older
Mexican WOMAN who is behind the counter BOBBY enters

BOBBY
Got any cold soda

WOMAN
Eh

BOBBY
Soda You got any soda

WOMAN
Hablar slowly por favor My ingles no es
bien

BOBBY

Soda You know
Bobby cups his hand and brings it to his mouth pantomiming

WOMAN
Oh Something to eat Si

She holds up a pack of Twinkies
BOBBY

Not eat Drink What the fuck is drink in
Spanish uh agua
The old womans eyes widen She starts to scream but quickly
clamps her hands over her mouth For a moment Bobby thinks the
woman is screaming at what he has said Then as if he feels a
presence behind him Bobby turns slowly to face the TWO
tough-looking unshaven tattoo-covered BIKERS One holds a
gun

BIKER
Thats right lady Keep it in you and
nobody gets hurt That goes for you too
stud Gimmie the money Now

WOMAN
Eh

SECOND BIKER
The dinero Senora Hand it over

Bobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back

The woman goes to an old-fashioned cash register and rings it
open She hands the money to the biker

BIKER
Thats it Lady I got kids to put through
school

WOMAN

Es all I have
The biker turns to Bobby

BIKER
Okay pal Whatcha got Give it now

Bobby pulls a thick wad of cash (1000 plus) from his pant
pocket tosses it on the counter

BIKER (thumbing through it impressed)
NiceJust who are you beautiful What
else you got for papa

Bobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet flings it to him

BIKER
Betteryoure getting tasty Now toss the
bag sweetie

BOBBY
Its just books
BIKER

BOBBY (an entreaty)

BIKER

Bobby takes an unsteady breath

BOBBY
No

BIKER

SECOND BIKER

BIKER

WOMAN
Senor give him the bag

BIKER
Thats all right He doesnt want to give
me the bag

SECOND BIKER
Hes fucking with you man Shoot him

BIKER (contd)
-he doesnt have to give me the bag

The biker grabs Bobbys bag Bobby flinches in anticipation of a
shot but refuses to let go of the bag The biker swings the gun
hard clipping Bobby across the forehead Bobby falls against
the counter and to the floor The woman starts to scream The
biker grabs up the pack then looking back at the woman sees a
ring on her finger He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring
The woman screams wildly

SECOND BIKER
Lets go man

BIKER
A little extra never hurt Benji would you
just relax
WOMAN
No No My wedding ring

He pulls the ring from the womans finger and pushes her back
With Bobbys bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave

BIKER
Now we go

WOMAN
You go to El Diablo

From beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun The woman
fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the
biker He falls to the ground very dead amid a shower of
blood and shredded money

SECOND BIKER
Bugger You bitch

The Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place
out of the torn bag His eyes go big with greed as he FIRES at
the old woman who ducks behind the counter

The Biker grabs for the bag and whats left of the money not
expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her SECOND
BLAST into him and the bag

Whatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to
shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead

Bobby is staggered crawls towards the shreds

WOMAN (cursing in Spanish)
Hijos de puta Bayan a comer su propia
mierda en el infierno (TRANSLATION Sons
of bitches Go eat your own shit in hell)

She comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet
and the 1000 cash roll from the dead bikers pants

WOMAN
I call the sheriff

BOBBY
No No police

Bobby gives her a hundred dollars

WOMAN
A hundred dollars No police
Bobby gives her some more cash She looks at him Finally he
gives her the entire wad

BOBBY
No police until I leave

Bobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white
FADE TO
EXT STREET - LATER

BOBBY dazed and holding his head sits on the ground next to a
SPIGOT that is dripping water He cups his hands under the
water and splashes it against his face lightly wiping the cut
above his eye The SHERIFFS CAR goes wailing by on the main
drag Recoiling from being spotted Bobby tries to take another
drink A SCORPION crawls out of the faucet He jumps back

EXT HARLINS GARAGE - LATER

DARRELL is leaning under the hood of a car working on its engine
as BOBBY walks up

BOBBY
Hey
DARRELL

BOBBY

DARRELL

BOBBY

Bobby rolls his eyes Then notices the front fenders have been
removed

BOBBY

DARRELL
Then you aint gonna have the car

BOBBY

Bobby digs through his bloodied wallet trying to hide it from
Darrell He fishes out a five dollar bill Then digs out a
bloody one dollar bill from his pocket

BOBBY
Ive got fivesix dollars

Darrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of
greasy bills he carries in his overalls

DARRELL
Then youre only a hundred-forty-five in

Express Gold Card and call that guy with

Bobby proffers his Movado watch

BOBBY
Look I got a Movado Its worth at least
seven eight hundred You could sell it for

DARRELL (studying it)

BOBBY

DARRELL

lawyer Sweet talk me all you want Didnt

BOBBY
What sign Fuck the sign I want my car

DARRELL

Bobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or
not to fight for the car then wheels and walks away

Darrell looks at him smirks

INT TRUCK STOPDINER - LATER

It is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any
open road Counter with stools laminated menus a Wurlitzer in
the corner belching out country TUNES Business is slow but
its the only restaurant in town There is a SHORT ORDER COOK in
the kitchen and FLO a hard-looking waitress is behind the
counter A couple of regular drivers ED and BOYD are seated
on the stools Boyd is flipping a coin

ED

BOYD

BOBBY comes out of the mens room and sits at the end of the
counter He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a
mess He buries his face in the menu
BOBBY

FLO

Flo moves off

BOBBY
and a waitress named Flo Christ

As Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him he
hears from somewhere outside the diner the sound of a POLICE
RADIO crackling He now feels something against his foot He

looks down and sees a CAT rubbing against his leg He gives it
a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech

BOBBY
Fucking cat

In the background two teenagers sit at a booth TOBY looks the
part of a local wearing jeans and a white T-shirt His hair is
cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school His
girl JENNY is nondescript neither ugly nor beautiful She is
the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look
Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom After he
is gone Jenny walks to Bobby

JENNY
Hey Mister You gotta quarter for the
juke

BOBBY
What

JENNY
I wanna play a song on the juke You got a
quarter

Bobby looks at Jenny then picks a quarter from his winnings and
flips it to her He cant resist putting a little charm into it

JENNY
What happened to your hand

BOBBY
I cut it shaving I know I gotta be more
careful

JENNY

Got any requests

BOBBY
That country shit all sounds the same to
me

JENNY

Bobby half smiles Jenny plays a song Patsy Clines Your
Cheatin Heart Jenny takes up a stool next to Bobbys

JENNY

BOBBY

JENNY

JENNY

BOBBY

JENNY

Toby walks back into the room He looks at Jenny He looks at
Bobby He looks at Jenny talking to Bobby He loses it

TOBY
NoNoNo Im seeing but Im not

TOBY

Bobby sits for a beat he doesnt need a fight with Toby now
with his damaged hand nor does he need to be noticed either He
sits there

FLO

Toby you stop it now Cant you see hes
got a hurt hand

TOBY
Dont you never mind Flo This is gonna
be over real quick

Reluctantly Bobby rises facing off against Toby each clenching
their fist and waiting for the other to make the first move

The tension builds We see it on the faces of Jenny Flo and
the regulars Just then the record on the juke ends and the
needle scratches off There is the crackle of a police radio as
the door to the diner opens and SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER walks in
The tension eases Toby mindful of the sheriff steps closer to
Bobby and whispers menacingly into his ear

TOBY
Youre lucky Mister Dont think its
over I called you out and Im gonna see
this through You hear me (to Jenny)
Come on girl I got half a mind to make
you walk home

Toby takes Jenny by the arm and pulls her out of the diner

FLO
My lord that little baby of yours Virgil
has gotten cutern a bunnys nose

SHERIFF
What was that all about

FLO
You know how that Toby is Thinks every
man he sees is after his Jenny
SHERIFF

sees

FLO (to Bobby)
You pay Toby no mind He just likes to
show off for his girl Give him a couple
of hours hell cool off Still want that

BOBBY (tense seeing the Sheriff)
Ill take it to go

Bobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his
forehead

ED

FLO

Bobby pays for the beer Flo opens the register

FLO
Let me get your change

SHERIFF
Flo Im just gonna help myself to a refill
on the coffee

The Sheriff reaches around the counter for the pot

FLO
You be careful now Virgil

Just as the words leave Flos mouth the Sheriff spills the pot
It shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere
Flo runs over to him

SHERIFF
Son of a bitch

FLO
Virgil Now look at what you done Are

SHERIFF
I think I burned my gun hand

As Flo bends to wipe the counter Virgil touches her intimately
SHERIFF (Contd)

FLO

serve you right you asshole Put it under
some cold water Joe run get a mop and
clean this fuckin mess up
While everyone is distracted Bobby notices that the register
drawer has been left open He looks around to make sure he is
not being watched Slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer
It gets closer and closer As he is about to grab the money
there the cat - the same one he kicked away earlier - hisses
and claws at his hand Bobby jumps back startled

FLO
Shasta Now whyd you go and scare the
nice man like that Sorry about that

it to him) You try to have a nice day now

With the Sheriff occupied and the Mexican Jose mopping the
floor Bobby exits

jewelry sits behind his desk eating lunch and cleaning his
nails SERGEI his goon in a shiny polyester shirt hovers over

dollars you call me - collect - then ask

Oh fuck you too

MR ARKADY

BOBBY desperate stares at the bandage of his wounded hand

throbs holding the hand to his ear

He marches from the phone booth past an old HARDWARE STORE The
phone falls from the hook and we hear a recorded voice

VOICE (VO)
Thank you for using ATandT

In the store window Bobby notices a set of garden shears for
sale

EXT EMPTY STREET - LATER DAY

BOBBY walks a bit going nowhere in particular Looking at his
watch thinking of Mr Arkady he shields himself with one hand
from the sun At the side of an old building in the bit of
shade it throws he twists at the beer cap which sticks and
wont turn Bobby tries again twisting harder -- too hard -- as
the cap jerkily twists off cutting into his hand as it rotates
Bobby yells in pain At the same time the beer comes foaming
from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve The bottle slips
from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground emptying He
clutches his bleeding hand pissed

BOBBY
Fuck Fuck Fuck I hate this fuckin town
I hate it Do you hear me
(no answer)
Get me outta here please I gotta get out
of this place

As if in answer a JEEP drives by on the main street GRACE
looks pretty hot up there in the drivers seat her eyes behind
sunglasses flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she
keeps going

Bobbys eyes throw back his own hostility at her but
unfortunately she misses it as he now notices -- across the
street -- a well-kept building with the most modern decor and
signage reading McKennas Realty Co

He thinks about it in a quandary
EXT HIGHWAYCAR - DAY
In a rented convertible we now see SERGEI racing across the

desert His jacket off a man with a mission He glances at his
watch eager to get to this fucking hole in the wall which is
somewhere on this incomprehensible American map he holds in one
hand

INT JAKES REALTY OFFICE - DAY

BOBBY squats looking at a real estate model of a desert
development JAKE smiles

JAKE

BOBBY
I was hoping we could talk

JAKE
Talk About what

BOBBY
About things About your wife

JAKE
Sweet Grace What about her

BOBBY
About what you said this morning

Jake shakes his head as if he doesnt understand
BOBBY

You said you had an insurance policy out on
your wife Fifty-thousand dollars

JAKE

BOBBY
You said youd cut that up with the man who

JAKE

BOBBY

JAKE

BOBBY
Bullshit You wanted me to kill her

JAKE
A man doesnt always mean the things he

BOBBY

You meant it

JAKE
What makes you say that

BOBBY
Because youre a slimy bastard who would
have his wife killed just to get his hands
on some money

JAKE
And what does that make you

BOBBY
The slimy bastard whos going to do it for
you (pause) Youre a jealous man Jake

If you cant have Grace to yourselfwell
youre not the sharing kind

For a moment Jake stares quietly at Bobby

JAKE
Well I guess I have what you calla
love-hate relationship with Grace

BOBBY
You love her but you hate her
JAKE
No I hate loving her I hate the kind of
person she is I hate having to tolerate
the little games she plays Like fucking
half of the town behind my back and
laughing at me The bitch She loved to
play She wants me to hit her and when I
hit her she likes it She tortures me But
shes family Shes my little girl My
baby I couldnt stand to watch her eyes
roll back in her head as she sucks her last
breath or to see her pretty pink brains
spill from her skull No Not me But you
You got the killing in you boyHow much

A pause

BOBBY
Make it twenty

JAKE (stressed paces)
Twenty-thousand I dont have that kind of

hands on

BOBBY
How much could you get

JAKE
Maybe ten-thousand And thats a
maybe

BOBBY

I need thirteen

JAKE
Thats a bit much

BOBBY
Were not talking about buying a car Jake
Were talking about killing your wife Its
thirteen or its nothing

For a moment the two men stand silent All we hear is the
ticking of a grandfather CLOCK that stands in the corner

JAKE
You drive a hard bargain but I had a
feeling you were my boy when I met you

BOBBY
Im not your boy I dont like you I got
no choice but to do business with you
Lets just call this a nasty little
marriage of convenience

JAKE
Dont say that I had a marriage of
convenience with Grace and look where
thats lead Well looks like we got
ourselves a contract

BOBBY (sarcastic)
Do we shake hands

JAKE
If you cant trust the man youve hired to
kill your wife The thing is its got

to look like an accident thats the thing
If it doesnt then its no good I wont
get a dime and its my neck thatll be on
the chopping block while youre living it
up somewhere

BOBBY
How do you want it

JAKE
How the hell should I know Ive never had
a wife killed before Jesus Christ You
want this job you dont know how to do
this I guess I should have hired a
professional

BOBBY
You want to do this yourself I dont have
to do this you know

JAKE
Be quiet boy I got to figure this thing
Im thinking It cant be done at the
house It should be

Jake walks the office thinking
BOBBY

Come to think of it how bout some money
upfront
JAKE
Oh yeah sure Why dont I buy you a plane
ticket right out of here while Im at it I
know you

(then)
This is what you do Go to the house to
see her
BOBBY
(beat)

And tell her what

EXT MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER DAY

BOBBY stands on the porch talking to GRACE through the screen of
the front door The look on his face is sincere Hers is
skeptical We see the action take place as we hear Jakes VO

JAKE (VO)
I dont know Tell her you had to see
her Tell her you dont care if shes
married or not you had to be with her
Sweet talk the woman A young buck like
you must be good at that Then maybe
shift the conversation Get her thinking
about that jeep of hers She loves that
thing Maybe the only thing she does love
Shell want to take you for a ride

BOBBY
I know youre not surprised Im back here
cause you can read my mind and all

Shes not surprised

GRACE (seeing his new cut)
Thats some cut I told you to be more
careful

BOBBY
Yeah well I said I was an idiot Whatta

you say we get out of here take a drive
somewhere talk

GRACE
How do you know hes still not here

BOBBY
Guys like me take those chances Lets go

EXT DESERT - DAY
GRACES JEEP cuts hard across the desert Grace has a wild
excited look on her face BOBBY sits next to her looking
somewhat nervous

JAKE (VO)
Shell take you out somewhere in the
desert She loves it out there ridin
through the red rock and the mesas So do

I I guess we got that in common Shell
ride you out someplace quiet Someplace
deserted

FADE TO
EXT DESERT - LATER DAY

GRACE has stopped the JEEP on a plateau BOBBY sits beneath its
shade while Grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected by the
heat VULTURES swoop above

JAKE (VO)
There wont be anyone for miles around
Just the two of you and some prairie dogs
Thats all You can sweet talk her a
little if you like Makes no difference to
me Just put her at ease make her feel

relaxed -- then do it
JAKES VO ends The scene is now synch with real time
BOBBY

Are there snakes out here

GRACE
They hear you comin They wont bother
you Just dont sneak up on em

BOBBY
Doesnt the isolation bother you

GRACE
Yeah but I like the sun I grew up ona
reservation The sun the desert they
like a religion to us Jakes the same
way He loves the desert I guess were
alike that way Thats about the only way

BOBBY
You love him

GRACE
No
BOBBY
Did you ever

GRACE
Depends on what you call love I grew up on
a reservation A patch of desert in the
middle of nowhere Thats where they stick
ndians Bobby Thats where they leave us
to die My brother killed himself when he
was 19 cause he couldnt take it anymore
Theres no hope there Jake was my ticket
out Mom and me

BOBBY
s that why youre with him

GRACE
let him think he was courtin me but I
reeled him in like a fish on a line I
wanted him I wanted what he could give me
and I wouldve done anything to get him Is
that love

BOBBY
Im guessing no

GRACE
Yeah I guess youre right

BOBBY
take it things didnt much work out the
way you planned

GRACE
m still here arent I See this

Grace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the
desert The vultures are very much a part of this landscape

GRACE (CONT)

All this nothing It doesnt get to Jake
like it gets to me He says he dont mind
being nothing but a big fish in a small
pond More like a little fish in a dried
up watering hole

BOBBY
You could leave him

GRACE
I dont know how
BOBBY
Walk away

GRACE
Its not that easy Maybe you can take
chances maybe you can wander around like
some stray wherever you please I cant
I dont want to be alone I need to know
Im going to be taken care of

BOBBY
You need a meal ticket is what you mean
Some guy you can latch onto just long
enough for him to get you out of here

GRACE
Is that so bad Its not like I wouldnt
try to make him happy For awhile anyway
I mean I would do things for him I
guess Im no good that way I guess I
tried to sucker you along like that Do
you hate me for it I wouldnt blame you
if you did But maybe its like you said
You just got to do whatever it takes to get
out

BOBBY (soft echo)
Whatever it takes

Grace steps to the edge of the plateau

GRACE
I wish I was a bird I know its stupid
Every child says that When I was growing
up some of the old ones on the reservation
believed people could actually change into
animals I wish I could

We see Bobby behind Grace He stares at her standing on the
edge of the plateau He rises and walks towards her slowly but
with deliberation

GRACE (CONT)
If I was a bird I would fly to Florida to
Disney World I always wanted to go there
Id fly to New York Maybe I guess New
York isnt the best place to be a bird
Id fly to St Louis then New Orleans all
over Texas Then Id fly to California I
guess by then Id have seen it all and I
could die
Bobby now stands a few feet behind Grace She kicks a rock and
watches it sail over the lip of the cliff into the nothingness
below

GRACE (CONT)
They say you dont feel anything The
shock kills you before you hit the ground
I dont know how they would know that But
I heard its just like flying straight
down into the ground I guess if it
doesnt hurt its a beautiful thing

Bobby tenses himself Sweat forms on his brow as he stands
directly behind Grace with his hands extended before him They
hover just below her shoulder blades ready to push forward
Suddenly Grace wheels Startled by Bobby she almost falls over
the edge Bobby grabs her her weight still going back

Graces life is literally in his hands She looks down at the
ground far below then up into Bobbys eyes She shows no fear
but instead wears a curious smirk

GRACE
Hates a funny thing Right now I bet you
dont know if you want to kill me or fuck
me

Bobby hesitates then pulls Grace close and kisses her with
great ardor on the lips

EXT APACHE LEAP - DAY

On a blanket on the ground BOBBY and GRACE make love quickly
hotly her dress pulled up his pants down But Grace is
troubled and pulls out further frustrating Bobby

GRACE
NoStop I cant

Her eyes withdraw into another dimension as she hikes her dress
back up Bobby comes out of his own head feels the distance
between them

BOBBY
Whats the matterGrace

GRACE
Nothing

BOBBY
Dont feel like nothing
He finishes relieving himself behind a tree
on

GRACE

puts his pants back

Get out of town Bobby as quick as you

can

BOBBY

Grace Ive been fucked over too many
times by too many women Youre becoming

the queen of hot and cold

GRACE
Youd never understand

BOBBY
Try me

GRACE

Its just such a mess With Jake I mean

BOBBY

Nothing I understand better than a mess

GRACE (in great tension)

Jake was with my Mom after my real Dad

died

BOBBY
You mean the Shaman

GRACE

He was a Shamanin the mine We had
nothin after he died Jake took us in
gave us a little money He used to call me
his little halfbreed He kept Mom on
the side yknow cause he was married
someplace else He had kids in Phoenix I

think no one knew him around here

the thing wasyou see
(pause)

he was raping me the whole time

but

-for

years He loved to do things to me Believe
it or not he used to say he was in love
with my ass Yever been in love with a

womans ass
The dominoes are tumbling for Bobby

BOBBY
Yeah
GRACE
Youre sick toohe loved to do things to
me Control me My Momit tore her up
cause she couldnt do nothing about it She
become alcoholicand the funny thing is--
I liked it I liked being controlled by
Jake The truth was as far out and crazy as

he got wanted more I wanted to go all
the way Women say they dont want to be
taken like really taken -- thats bullshit

-- they do The first time he finished with
me he said I was a woman now I was 14
Then he started crying like a babywanted
me to hold him Its a strange feeling to
hate someone so much for so many years but
still want to hold him comfort him They
found my Mom right down there (points) at
the bottom of Apache Leap She had cactus
needles stuck all over her body and
VirgilSheriff Potter said she was drunk
and went insane But Ill never believe she
ran off that cliff by accident She was

born on this earth and she loved it
was like me She just wanted to fly

Bobby is quietly stunned A whole world has
and he isnt sure yet where the story ends

at work here beyond his control

GRACE

She
away

opened up to him
There is some force

After he got his divorce he forced me to

marry himbut when I saw her body

I

swore to her on my soul that some day Id

get Jake for what he did to her

BOBBY
Im sorry

GRACE
Yeah What do you want Life right

(shrugs stoic) Have you ever been t
California

BOBBY
Yeah

GRACE (as if in a dream)
Is it far from here

BOBBY

fe)

Oh yeah Its far its another world
GRACE
Is it pretty

BOBBY
Oh yeah Its beautiful beautiful beaches
Blue water and clear skies as far as you
can see

GRACE (like a little girl)
Would you take me with you

BOBBY (pause)
I wish I could

GRACE
Please I wont hang on you As soon as we
get there you can dump me I dont care I
just want to get out of here

BOBBY
Honey baby I cant I cant even get out
of here myself Believe it or not I need a
lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car
back from that crazy mechanic

GRACE
Darrell You know he and Jake are

BOBBY
You dont have any money put away do you

GRACE
Jake never gives me moren twenty bucks at
a time like a bird in a cage he dont
want me goin anywhere

BOBBY
»you could get me money Ill get you
out of here

She looks at him

GRACE
Theres money A lot

The words hang there thick between them

BOBBY
Where

GRACE
Jake hides it In a safe In the floor In
Bobbys

the bedroom He counts it He loves to sit
there and count it

BOBBY
What do you mean

GRACE
At night He just sits there and laughs and
talks to himself and counts it I heard
him My Mom told me he had a hunnert
thousand dollars down there Maybe more

eyes widen in hope

BOBBY
In cash

GRACE

Oh yeah Theres nothing else with Jake He
dont trust banks He keeps the money in
the floor right under the bed He loves it
so much he wouldnt think of spending any
of it on me I never seen it but I know
hes got more than a hunnert thousand at
least

BOBBY
One-hundred-thousand That son-of-a-bitch

GRACE (puzzled)
What do you mean

BOBBY (ignoring her)
If its in a safe wed have to get the
combination--

GRACE
It takes a key He keeps it on himself all
the time I mean all the time It
scratches up against me when we do it

BOBBY
If the keys on him how do we get the key

GRACE
Kill him

Spoken almost innocently it hangs there between them

silence

BOBBY
I cant kill Grace I cant kill anybody
GRACE
Its not like hes a young man Bobby Hes
had time to live Itd be quick I mean he
wouldnt even have to feel it
(seductively) I mean sometime in the
middle of the night when its quietwhen
hes asleep you could just come up behind
him when hes pounding on me and

Grace lays her hands on Bobby starting to caress him He
bristles and freezes with fear and disgust

BOBBY
Shit Listen to you Are you crazy
Grace

He abruptly pulls away

BOBBY
Jesus Christ I think this place is making
me crazy I was crazy to come back here and
see you Im crazy for listening to anyone
in this town and Id sure as hell be crazy
if I spent another minute with you

Grace rises covering her nakedness shooting a hand to his
face like she did when she read his fortune

GRACE

But its in you Bobby I see it I see
Death Its in your heart Let it out for
me Let it out

Hes mesmerized Then

GRACE
Do it for me Bobby youll never regret
it I promise you Ill do anything for
you Anything

Bobby pauses terribly torn

BOBBY
Itake me back to town

He turns away towards the jeep Grace has a tone of desperation
in her voice

GRACE
You need the money Bobby Its a lot more
than 100000 A lot more How are you
going to get out of here You need the
money Whatever it takes Bobby remember

Bobby walks past the jeep on his way back to town alone
GRACE
Where you going Ill give you the
rideCome back Bobby Its three miles

Bobby doesnt look back Her eyes drift backwards into her
solitude

GRACE (to herself)
BobbyWhatever it takes

EXT DESERTALONG THE ROAD - LATER DAY

BOBBY walks through the desert parallel to the road still
rage Desert insects produce a cacophony of drones buzzes

ina
and

clicks A rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush A VOICE

whispers to him

JAKE (VO)
Youve got the killing in you boy

Bobby turns and looks around Just desert He continues

JAKE (VO)
Next time youll do just fine

BOBBY
No

The screen burns a bright white

EXT STREET CORNER - DAY

In a news pot further down the street from where he was first
seen the old BLIND MAN sits with his dead DOG speaking as if

into camera sipping on a Dr Pepper

BLIND MAN

Its the desert that makes you crazy The
loneliness out here Nobody to talk to
People on the run Trailer parks White
trash I seen some peculiar things on a hot
day I seen a scorpion sting itself to
death It just keeps driving its tail into
its body again and again A little killer
killing itself Seen a coyote kill itself
too Just kept on biting and tearing at
its own legs Near tore one clean off
before it bled to death And what a white
manll do when its freezing one moment
hot as hell the next A man could get
hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders
with another (smacking his lips) kiss kissy
kiss Nice pussy ysee see it coming I
dont know what it is about the desert I
figger its sort of like putting a kettle
of water over a fire People is mostly
water We boil when its hot Cept when
we boil the waters got no place to go It
just churns inside of us until we can cool
off If its not too late

BOBBY is now revealed standing next to the blind man and we
realize the blind man has been talking to him all along Bobby
sips a Dr Pepper as well

BOBBY
You sure seen a lot for a blind man

BLIND MAN
Just cause I aint got eyes doesnt mean I
cant see

BOBBY
That a fact

Bobby noticing now all the little NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that the
Blind Man keeps around him in a sort of inchoate stall

BLIND MAN
I can see just fine For example Youre
a young man who thinks hes got someplace
to be

A POLICE RADIO crackles Bobby tensing

BOBBY
Maybe I do

BLIND MAN
Or maybe you just think you do Just
another small town One guy chasing you
You go big town Just gonna have four guys
after you instead Kiss kissy kiss It gets
down to one thing -- are you a human being
or are you one of those hungry ghosts out
there never satisfied with nothing Cause
you gotta remember you can run just as far
as you can but wherever you go thats
where you gonna be
Bobby is clearly unnerved by this

stands

As SHERIFF POTTER cruises by

BOBBY
I think Ive heard that before

BLIND MAN

BOBBY

BLIND MAN

day were all eyes in the same head And
everything is everything

BOBBY

BLIND MAN
And everything is nothing too

BOBBY (shakes his head)
Maybe one day Ill get to sit on a corner
and spout wise

BLIND MAN
Think youll live that long

Suddenly the blind man

radio in it

EXT STREET - DAY

Toby and Bobby square off sizing each other up and preparing
for a violent confrontation Just as the two are about to clash

we hear the voice of SHERIFF POTTER from OFF CAMERA

SHERIFF (0C)

The two men freeze in their tracks as Potter drives up fast

TOBY
Hey Sheriff Potter

SHERIFF (tough)

The Sheriff looks right through Bobby who knows this is more
than a conversation He pulls up to Harlins garage Bobby gets
out

SHERIFF

With this thinly veiled threat the Sheriff drives on As Bobby
watches feeling the pressure to get out now while he can

EXT HARLINS GARAGE - LATER DAY

DARRELL is cleaning his tools Bobbys MUSTANG sits prominently
in the car bay washed and gleaming as BOBBY walks up

DARRELL

Sheriff who knows me

Bobby is in a rage He turns to leave and walks a few paces

He sees a WRENCH lying on a table For a second his mind reels
then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down
on Darrells head He stops cold Because ol Darrell holds a
CROWBAR in a batters stance ready to smash it onto the Mustang

DARRELL
You want to play Mister Ill play with
you You want to smash something So do
I

Darrell pulls back the crowbar ready to swing

BOBBY
No Okay Okay

DARRELL
Whats the matter The fight gone out of
you Im just gonna smash a headlight
Maybe two

BOBBY (pleading almost crying)
Please just leave the car alone

DARRELL
Mister you already pissed me off but good

Darrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car and
drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a long scratch

BOBBY (about to lose it)
Goddamn you You son of a bitch

DARRELL
There you go sweet talking me again

Darrell begins to laugh Bobby desperate looks to the trunk
thinking of his gun in there

His POV -- the trunk A FLASHBACK of the GUN goes through his
mind

BOBBY
Look Harlin

DARRELL
Darrell

BOBBY
Darrell Ill get you your money I just
have to get something out of the trunk

Using his TRUNK KEY he tries to open it but realizes the lock
has been changed

BOBBY
What the fuck did you do to my trunk

DARRELL
Well that keys not gonna work I had to
pop the lock You didnt leave me the trunk

key

BOBBY
And you had to go into the trunk didnt
you

DARRELL

When I work on a car I work on a car

BOBBY (snaps)
You motherfucker (etc)

DARRELL
You cant help yourself can you mister
Youre out of control

Darrell starts to laugh It is a repetitive almost demonic
laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on
Bobbys anguished face
EXT STREET - DAY

As BOBBY steps out into the glaring sun he notices down at the
other end of the town GRACES JEEP parked right outside the
SHERIFFS OFFICE empty

Presently GRACE and the SHERIFF walk out TALKING and she gets
in says a few last words and drives away

Bobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet Is she selling
him out Hes very confused turbulent

INT BUS DEPOT - LATER DAY

Bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this
whole town

her sane tone reminds Bobby of how far down hes come He
shrinks suddenly ashamed of himself She takes the cash on the
counter hands him a ticket

CLERK

BOBBY

She nods puts a closed sign in the ticket window disappears

EXT BUS DEPOT - LATE DAY

We hear the crackle of the same POLICE RADIO again OFF CAMERA
as BOBBY walks out of the depot ticket preciously held in his
hand and suddenly reels as he sees SERGEI about a 100 yards
down the main stretch slowly rolling into town in his
convertible looking for guess who

BOBBY
Holy shit

INT SERGEIS CAR - SIMULTANEOUS

BOBBY turns away but not fast enough SERGEI spots him hits
the pedal

SERGEI
Got you shitface Bobby Cooper Bobby
Cooper

EXT MAIN STREET - SIMULTANEOUS

BOBBY ducking around a corner hears the brief Whoop of the
sheriffs POLICE SIREN He glances back

His POV - sure enough the SHERIFFS having a field day Hes
just pulled SERGEI over At this distance we catch snippets of
conversation as the Sheriff ambles from his car checking
Sergeis out-of-state plates

SHERIFF
Wheres the fire sweetheart Dont know how
they work things in Nevada but we got
speed limits in this state
SERGEI
Vat I am going 5 miles an hour I am
looking town I not even moving

We pop in closer to their conversation -- Bobby relishing this
in his minds eye Sergei is constantly looking off to where he
last saw Bobby But the Sheriff strangely pays no attention to
these looks

SHERIFF
Whoa what kind of accent you got there
You one of them Russians

SERGEI
I am Russian da I am also rich Russian

da Maybe we work something out my friend
Sheriff

SHERIFF
What You trying to bribe me mister Just
cause you Russians aint commies anymore
dont think money can buy everything

Down the street Sheriff Potter is holding up a concealed GUN

SHERIFF
Whats that (He grabs the gun)
concealed is a definite no no in this
town Ivan You know anything about
Jamillas grocery store

SERGEI
What fuckin grocery store you fucking
shithead idiot You call yourself a
police

Sergei looking Bobbys direction

SHERIFF
Get out of the car spread them You can
jawbone all you want or you have the right
to shut the fuck up You commie
motherfucker Either way youre goin to
the can

SERGEI
I want my lawyer

Sheriff cuffs Sergei and sticks him in the police car

Bobby cant help smiling as he turns away to the SODA MACHINE
seen in an earlier scene
He comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and dying
for a drink in this heat inserts the coin Though still under
considerable pressure from all sides this lucky break with
Sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new
today -- some luck

The icy cold soda bottle shoots out Bobby raises it to his
lips about to taste it about to relax for once Violently it
explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain
from a KIDNEY PUNCH He stumbles forward into the soda machine
gasping The legs of his assailant are close to him but the
face is unseen

Bobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the
brunt of the blow into the machine re-opening the wound Blood
starts to seep through the bandage

BOBBY
Ow

Bobby crumples to the ground as TOBY now towers over him with
his fists curled and a snarl on his lips

TOBY
Get up Mister Dont ever let it be said
Toby Tucker beat the living shit out of
someone without giving them a fair chance

BOBBY (gasping)
What the hell are you doing You fucking
psycho

TOBY
Im doing what any man would do if hed
been offended Im stompin your ass

BOBBY
You idiot You dont even know what youre
fighting over

TOBY
My honor thats what Im fighting over

whoop you where you lie

JENNY comes running up the street

JENNY
Toby Toby Tucker leave him alone

TOBY

see

Jenny runs to Bobby and cuddles him where he lays

JENNY
Dont be afraid of him none I dont care

together

BOBBY
Get away from me

Bobby sees his bus ticket on the ground He grabs for it but
Toby beats him to it

TOBY

BOBBY

TOBY
Mexico You going to Mexico

BOBBY

TOBY

Toby sticks the ticket in his mouth and chews it up whole

BOBBY

TOBY (between bites)
Im gonna beat you so bad you gonna be
eatin nothing but soup the erst of your
days Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than
you when Im done Im gonna mess you up
so bad you gonna make your own momma sick
Im gonna

Tobys words drift to Bobby from a million miles away The
world around him is like a dream or a nightmare A primal rage
wells inside of Bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the
soda bottle up out of nowhere across Tobys head smashing him
backwards Then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on
the boys face and head
Jenny screams

JENNY
Stop it Youre killing him

Jenny grabs Bobbys arm literally hanging all her weight on it
stopping him from striking Toby again

JENNY
Youre killing him Toby Toby
Jenny sinks to the ground and cuddles Toby Bobby stands He
looks at Toby then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief His
bandage is soaked with his own blood but his adrenaline numbs
the pain

JENNY
You killed him You killed him

She wails in the background as he backs away around the corner
into Main Street crossing to where the PHONE BOOTH is

EXT PHONE BOOTH - LATE DAY

BOBBY (VO)

She quickly hangs up the phone

Bobby also hangs up the phone an unreadable expression on his
face

INT MCKENNA LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY

JAKE sits in an easy chair reading a paper Puffs of smoke from
his pipe rise from behind the paper and hang like a cloud over
his head GRACE stands in the doorway body stiff and arms
crossed staring at him

JAKE
Who was that on the phone

GRACE
Wrong number

JAKE
You spent a long time talking for a wrong
number But then you make friends so
easily Dont you Grace

Grace has no answer for that so she says nothing A long
moment passes then

GRACE
I put up new drapes Jake

JAKE
I know I was here when your apprentice
was helping you Remember

GRACE
You never said anything About the drapes

JAKE
They look nice

GRACE
You havent even looked at them once

Jake lowers the paper looks at the drapes

JAKE
They look nice

GRACE
I picked them out for you Jake I thought
you would like the colors

JAKE (softly admiring)
You look just like your mama when you move
like that against the light
Grace stares at the CHAIN now visible around Jakes neck that
disappears under his shirt She knows that hidden there is a

key and she fixes on it intently

JAKE
What the hell you looking at girl

GRACE
Nothing Jake Absolutely nothing

EXT DESERT - EVENING

The SUN is setting It strikes the horizon sending a ripple of
golden light through the sky

A MAN dances in the evening light with a small child in his
arms

EXT POLICE STATION - EVENING

SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is tossing horseshoes with his DEPUTIES

GRACE watches the sun going down outside her house cradling
herself in her arms A desert wind gently caresses her

EXT STREET CORNER - NIGHT

The BLIND MAN along with his dead DOG sits on the side of the
street

BLIND MAN
Well thats it Suns going down People
go home trade stories over dinner
Theyll talk about the day about the heat
laugh about something crazy it made them
do Theyll kiss sleep a few hours then
do it all over again

BOBBY now appears next to the blind man holding two Dr Peppers
He hands one to the blind man takes a sip of the other one and
offers him his own change

BOBBY
The day wasnt so bad We all got through
it all right

BLIND MAN (giving back the change)
Keep it

Theres a suggestion of cockiness in Bobby feeling his luck
coming back with the night His humour is enhanced by his POV
down the street

As DARRELL with his dilapidated truck readies SERGEIS
convertible for towing

BLIND MAN (OVER)
Aint over yet Night is part of day
separate but equal Night is when you let
your guard down when you see things in the
shadows and hear things in the dark

BOBBY
Difference between you and me old man is
I see the glass half full you see it half
empty

BLIND MAN
Night is when you want to sleep but the
dry heat keeps you tossin and turnin
Its when you wish the sun was bakin high
in the sky so you could see what it is
youre afraid of

BOBBY
You afraid of the dark

BLIND MAN
Afraid of it Boy I live in the dark All
cause of a woman who made me this way
People are afraid of what they cant see
I cant see nuthin so its all the same
to me Kiss from a beautiful woman kissy
kissy kiss a lick from a dog slurp
slurp the kiss of death (he makes a
strange sound) Its all the same to me

BOBBY
So were all just floating along like
twigs in a stream so enjoy the ride Is
that it

BLIND MAN
More or less

BOBBY
Not this twig friend I got plans

BLIND MAN
Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder
than a mans plans We all got plans I
planned on seeing all my life I know you
didnt plan on straying into town

BOBBY
No and I dont plan on sticking around

BLIND MAN

Well dont say I didnt warn you when
things go your way

BOBBY
You got a lotta philosophy in you old
timer but you dont fool me for one second
with all this blind man crap One minute
you lost your eyes in Vietnam next its
the joint Now its a woman Im hep to
you

The Blind Man slowly lifts his glasses showing his EYES at
last Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh An ugly
sight that even takes Bobby back a step
BLIND MAN
Used to be a young smartass like you Then
I got smart with the wrong mans daughter
Got some acid poured on my peepers for my
trouble You know human beings aint always
just human -- they got animals living
inside em tooPeople give spare change
to war heroes not fools All fools get is
pity May not have eyes but I see And
you boy

The Blind Man puts his glasses back on

BLIND MAN
You got my pity

BOBBY (doesnt believe him)
Hope she was worth it

BLIND MAN
Oh she was worth it She was worth every
black minute since

Bobby looks at his watch gets ready to go drops a coin into
the Blind Mans cup

BOBBY
Times up Any last words of wisdom

BLIND MAN

Things aint always the way they seem You
got to ask yourself is it worth it Day
comes Earthmaker is going to look in your
fucking heart Then you better know what it
is youre doing Are you a human being --
or just one of them hungry ghosts out there
floatin around

Bobby walks away smiling

BOBBY
You are crazy you know Be seeing you old
man

BLIND MAN

You know I wont be seeing you

The Blind Man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cup as if
he sees We dont really know He reaches into the cup and pulls
out the coin Bobby tossed in
BLIND MAN
Cheap bastard Gives me back my own
money Well Jesse times up lets go
for a walk

The Blind Man now stands up and pulls the seeing-eye dogs
harness The DOG struggles to its feet and they walk off down
the street together

INT MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT

GRACE stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock JAKE
yells to her from another room

JAKE (OC)
What the hell you doin Grace Are you
coming to bed or arent you

For a moment Graces hand wavers above the lock Suddenly like
a snake striking her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt

Just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the
bedroom

EXT YARD - MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT

A LIGHT is on in the bedroom window After a moment it dims and
the house is dark silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight
BOBBY steps into frame carrying an iron pipe

INT MCKENNA HOUSEBEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

We start close on GRACE -- a KEY slapping against her buttocks
as bedsprings groan We reveal Grace copulating on all fours
with JAKE from behind

JAKE
Ya little bitch you like it dont you You

GRACE

No No Please
He hits her Harder

In a strange flashback of his mind he now sees Graces MAMA
beneath him receiving his punishment

He stops abruptly He cant go on Fear coming into his eyes
He starts to whimper begging for his punishment andor
forgiveness

JAKE
Oh baby Im so sorry Im so sorry
(he starts to cry)
I didnt mean to hurt you so bad It
justgot away

He drops down burying his face between Graces legs

JAKE
Forgive me baby forgive me

He hides there from the world that he has created crying to
himself

Grace has an unreadable expression but thats certainly not a
new occurrence in their strange relationship

INT MCKENNA HOUSEBACKDOOR - NIGHT

The knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens BOBBY slips
quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the
door behind him It is nearly pitch dark and he has no
bearings He steps gingerly through the hall but in the
darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only
to catch it just before it crashes into the floor

INT MCKENNA HOUSEBEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

JAKE hears the noise He raises his head and cocks an ear to
the air She knows who it is and is concerned hes too early
GRACE
Whats the matter

JAKE
You didnt hear something

GRACE
Yeah I heard a key slapping against my
ass

JAKE

Theres someone in the house

GRACE (nervous)
Maybemaybe the wind blew something over
(encouraging him to continue) Come on
baby keep going

Jake climbs out of bed throwing on some pants reaching into a
drawer in the chest of clothes pulling out a small dark
metallic OBJECT

GRACE (realizing)
Whats that Jake -- wheres you get that

JAKE
Relax baby Stay here

He goes to the door She follows tries to block the door

GRACE
Jake dont go out there Call the sheriff

JAKE
Shhhh Just like your Mama always scared
of things

He maneuvers her aside and slips out the door into the corridor
INT LIVING ROOMMCKENNA HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

Crowbar in one hand BOBBY makes his way slowly through the
living room banging against the edge of a table He hops
silently in pain then waits at the door to the next room and
listens Hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the
darkness A moment later Bobby backs from the door and we see
the barrel of his own black 9mm BARETTA pressed against his
forehead JAKE appears now backing him into the living room
He switches on a LAMP

JAKE
Well well As I live and breathe I
didnt expect to be seeing the like of you
again Thought youd be long on your way
by now

Jake continues to press the gun to Bobbys head

BOBBY
Thats my gun(then) That fucking
Darrell

JAKE

I like Darrell He may be an idiot but
hes my half brother We own Harlins
together yeah that little redneck manages
to get paid no matter how things work out

BOBBY (realizing)

JAKE

BOBBY

JAKE
No but it dont matter anyway when youre

carpet and Im telling Sheriff Potter about
this drifter didnt have enough money to
fix his car And Darrell happened to find
his gun and through maybe this drifter

and figgered he might try to break in and
steal it

BOBBY
Wait a minute Just listen to me

JAKE

McKenna and turn his brains into wall

BOBBY stares at the automatic in JAKEs hand

BOBBY

Jake laughs a dont even think about it look

JAKE
A stranglingll do just fine Go to work

Bobby holds up his eight fingers with a you try look Jake
shrugs Bobby points to the crowbar on the carpet

BOBBY
How bout the pipe

JAKE (sarcastic)
Shes got a slender neck

Bobby turns and walks towards the bedroom Jake follows into an
adjoining room

JAKE
Hold on a second Come here

Bobby turns to Jake who is suddenly extremely upset

JAKE
How the hell did you know where the
bedrooms at

BOBBY
What are you talking about

JAKE (getting closer)
This morning when I came in on you and
Grace you swore you hadnt been near the
bedroom Now you make straight for it
INT HALLWAY

GRACE returns to listen This thing is like a seesaw battle of
wills

BOBBY (V0O)
Come on Jake --

JAKE (VO)
Dont Jake me boy Its a big house You
probably didnt even make it out to the
desert this afternoon

INT LIVING ROOM
JAKE has come right up on BOBBY in a rage

JAKE
Or did you just ply the afternoon away
between my sheets putting your lips all
over her you little horndog

BOBBY (changing tactics)
What difference does it make if I slept
with her Were gonna kill her

JAKE
Youre right I dont give a damn about
her But killing hers one thing Fucking
her behind my back thats another

Suddenly Jake swings his arm clipping Bobby across the side of
the head with the pistol and opening another bloody gash

Bobby crumbles to his knees crying out

Jake suddenly grabs Bobby by the hair forcing his face back and
smearing his lips with his own in a vengeful kiss The blood
from Bobbys wound runs down to his lips and mixes with Jakes
lips

JAKE
Now youve tasted both of us

He pulls back the hammer on the gun and levels it at Bobbys
head Bobby sees it coming plays his last card on his knees

BOBBY
OK I admit it I fucked her But its
her you have to worry about not me She
wants you dead Jake She wants you dead
and she wants your money
JAKE (hesitates)
What are you babbling about

BOBBY (talking fast)
Think about it How do you think I got in

hear a door splinter

INT HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

BOBBY (V0O)
How did the evening end After you went to
bed did she linger a bit Maybe just long
enough to leave the door unlocked Is that
what happened

INT LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

Like an old rag JAKE gradually soaks all this up becoming
heavier with the weight of the knowledge

JAKE
Youd tell me anything to save your
pathetic life

BOBBY
You know what kind of woman Grace is Jake
You know how badly she wants to get the
fuck out of Superior Whats she to you
Jake a woman who wants you dead Let me

dollars to get out of here with

JAKE

JAKE

positively pathetic Go on go kill

Bobby slowly stands
JAKE
Im not letting you walk for nothing Two

INT HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

GRACE bolts back to the bedroom the camera following her as she
flies

INT BEDROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
BOBBY walks it His POV -- the door Every step seems freighted
INT BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

GRACE is in a quandary How many seconds before Bobby walks in
to kill her Or can he really kill her Shes not sure

She looks around the room frantically Picks up a lamp puts it
down She looks quickly through her closet rummages below in
the boxes Suddenly she finds it

A dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off
its bindings Its a formidable piece of iron quite capable of
splitting a skull or impaling flesh

Grace hears the footsteps just outside the door She runs behind
the door

A moment later the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly
enters approaching the bed We sense the doubt in his eyes as
to whether he can kill her

In a reverse POV Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as
victimcloser closer He now lifts the edge of the bedcover
but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure

He suddenly hears a foot fall behind him then he feels her
presence He spins

Shes directly behind him hatchet raised His life is in her
hands

His eyes locked in an eternal moment

Her eyes the hatchet

SNAP CUT TO
INT HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

As JAKE anxiously torn waits there is a LOUD CRASH followed
by SOUNDS of struggle of murder of death Then

GRACE
Jake

It is a desperate cry for help Jake cant help himself He
breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved

JAKE
Grace

INT BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

JAKE bulls into the bedroom Its a mess furniture overturned
sheets and blankets all over the floor The lights broken
Waiting for him face down on the floor is BOBBYS BODY ina
pool of liquid A broken bottle lies nearby Bobbys body heaves
in its final death throes and then shudders quiet Over
there by the bed is GRACE who still clutches the HATCHET

The look on her face is pure shock

JAKE
Welllooks like you got him Grace
Thats goodthats real good He must of
slipped past me but you got him Looks
like that drifter from this morning Got
to be careful who you make friends with
sweetheart

Jake eyes the weapon in Graces hand

JAKE
Why dont you put that down Its all over
now Put it down

Grace eyes the gun in Jakes hand

JAKE
Go on girl Put it down

What choice does Grace have She lets the hatchet clank to the
floor

JAKE
Aww thats my Grace Not about to let
someone get the best of her Thats what I
love about you As dangerous as you are
unpredictable
behind Jake the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor very
much alive and clobbers Jake with a golf club Jake is
staggered but hes one tough old customer as he manages to spin
slowly gun still in one hand as if to fire

Before he can Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and
drives it straight into his back

He gurgles stunned from both sides but its like trying to

kill Rasputin He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the
rear trying to get his neck in a chokehold The gun FIRES once
discharging into the wall The hatchet is ripped from his back

Grace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged
rodeo-type fight Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back
An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes

Finally the two men go crashing to the ground rolling around
Bobby maintaining his stranglehold but calling to her his
hands full

BOBBY
Grace goddamit do something

Jakes eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale pleading for
help

JAKE
Grace

She commits Jumping into the fray its not clear whose side
shes really on as the three of them roll across the floor
strangling biting hitting spitting scratching gasping Its
a Guignol but the pressure from Bobbys forearm is taking its
toll on Jake Trying to bite Jake Grace bites Bobby instead
but then she scratches Jakes face Jake is grabbing her hard as
Bobby chokes him trying to use her to leverage himself away
But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on
her knees across the floor

She grabs the hatchet And stands moving back towards the two
men locked on the floor Bobby looks up at her hatchet in hand
no longer sure which way shell go

Jake however gasping for air eyes bulging spittle dripping
from his mouth looks at Grace with some inner certainty that
she will help him He gasps the words

JAKE
Help me Grace help
GRACE
Like you helped her Jake

Grace stands there deciding the power of the hatchet in her
hands She raises it suddenly over the two men

It flashes downwards Deep into the gut of her husband Jake
almost transfixing him to the floor

In the silence that follows Jakes eyes roll up to meet hers
But all she has for him is a cold distant stare

Jakes head drops as the life rushes out of him Bobby falls
back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat

BOBBY
What the helld you wait for

She doesnt answer turbulence in her face He rolls Jakes body
off upset She may have made it a murder but he was part of
it and he feels the shift in himself Theyre both in new
territory feeling an apartness between them

Suddenly JAKE gasps still alive It is too much for Bobby He
grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake silencing him one
last time

Grace is pushing the bed away from the wall slipping down on
her knees and prying open several floorboards

GRACE
The moneys right here Get the key

BOBBY
No You get it

He doesnt want to get close to Jake Grace coldly runs over to
his corpse ripping the chain key and all from the neck The
action pulls Jakes head up then she lets it thump back on the
floor She runs back to the floorboards

The top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed

Bobby watches -- his whole life it seems hanging on the
outcome

With the key she opens the safe Inside are rolled-up bundles
of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations She looks up at him
offering it as she reaches in for more Bobby also gets down on
his hands and knees and grabs more and more sucked into the
fever of freedom far more money than he lost at the grocery
store overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom
They see each other

GRACE
Didnt I tell you

BOBBY (plunging into the cash)
There must be 150 200 thousand here
Goddamnit Grace you were right

GRACE
We done it Bobby Oh my God

They laugh excitedly and start kissing rolling in the stacks of
cash some of which sticks to Bobbys sweating back The day
didnt turn out so bad after all for Bobby

GRACE
Fuck me baby

BOBBY (looking at Jake)
What about him

GRACE
Let him watch I want him to know what hes
missing

As they consummate their violent relationship for the first
time Jakes lifeless eyes watch them

EXT MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT

The LIGHT in the bedroom window is low candlelight but we sense
something watching them GRACEs silhouette moves across a
window

BOBBY now comes out of the house cautious walking down the
driveway

He stops thinks and walks back to open the hood of GRACES
JEEP

He reaches into the ENGINE and disconnects something then
closes the hood and walks on

EXT HARLINS GARAGE - NIGHT

BOBBY walks up to the SHACK near the garage and bangs on the
door A light goes on in the window DARRELL shouts out

DARRELL (0C)
What you want
BOBBY
Open up

DARRELL (0C)

up

Bobby in a hurry to get back should Grace pull any tricks
bangs and kicks against the door Darrell yanks the door wide

DARRELL
What the hell oh its you Mightve
figgered Listen I got a waitress coming
over What do you want

BOBBY
I want my car

DARRELL
You got the money

Bobby pulls the money from his hip pocket and hands it to
Darrell The mechanic fingers it suspiciously

DARRELL
Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar
bills And this morning you was broke

BOBBY
Thats none of your business Get the keys

fq

DARRELL

honest business

BOBBY
Yeah like Al Capone on tax day Get the keys

DARRELL (pause)
Well theres a 50 overnight storage

Bobby is ready at first to explode but then just laughs out
loud You got to give it to a guy like Darrell He holds up a
100 bill

BOBBY
All I gots a hundred Darrell You got change

DARRELL

BOBBY
Figgers Theres a scratch on the hood and how

Bobby pulls the hundred back from Darrells grasp

DARRELL (going to get the keys)
Dont know nothing about no gun

BOBBY

Darrell Forty thousand people die every
day How come none of them are you

DARRELL (throws him the keys)
I think you know where to find her

BOBBY

DARRELL (pulls out the trunk key)
Topped off the tank for you No charge
Just my way of doing business

fq

BOBBY (jovial confident now)
Listen up good Darrell Im getting outta
this shithole Youre staying And one
little peep outta you -- remember that gun
makes you part of the food chain Your
prints are all over it Id be awful
careful whose rectum I was pointing my
finger in Darrell

Bobby hops in the car a free man As Darrell glares at him
bewildered and frightened at the same time

EXT MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT

BOBBY turns the MUSTANG up the drive THE HEADLIGHTS cut the
darkness and land on an empty patch where Graces jeep had been
parked Bobby jumps from the Mustang and runs around
frantically His look is devastated He falls to his knees
about to sob when

GRACE opens the front door and pokes her head out putting out
several suitcases

GRACE
Bobby What the hells the matter with
you
BOBBY
I nothing I just stubbed my toe on
a rock Hurt like hell

GRACE
I got the money all packed I put the jeep
and his caddy in the garage Peoplell
think maybe me and Jake went away Buy us
some timeI know a back road we can take

BOBBY
Good thinking (looking at her four bags)
Whats all this

GRACE
Im not coming back

BOBBY (accepting)
Awright lets go I want to be fifty miles
from here before the sun comes up

GRACE
Funny thing the jeep wouldnt start I had
to push it

BOBBY (dryly)
Funny thing Ill get the bags

EXT MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT

Bobbys MUSTANG is backed towards the front of the house We
see a silhouette of BOBBY and GRACE carrying something wrapped
in a BLANKET and dumping it in the trunk

EXT DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A lone pair of HEADLIGHTS illuminate the night as the Mustang
cruises through the dark As the lights brighten the screen we

FADE TO
INT EXT MUSTANG - NIGHT

GRACE sits next to BOBBY peering out the windshield clutching
the money in a backpack Shes humming an Indian song

BOBBY
I cant see it

GRACE
It should be just up ahead Hold on
there There it is
A SIGN illuminated by the HEADLIGHTS It reads YOU ARE
LEAVING SUPERIOR THANKS FOR VISITING

Grace lets out a scream of joy leans over and hugs him

GRACE
Oh God I cant believe it Im out
Im finally out

The MUSTANG begins to swerve along the road

BOBBY
Hey Take it easy Want to get us killed

GRACE
You dont know what it feels like to be
free of that place

BOBBY
I dont know about that

GRACE
You spent a day in Superior I wasted my
entire life there I feel like someone just
took a million pounds off my shoulders

BOBBY
Weve still got some dead weight to get rid of

GRACE
Cant we just dump him fast someplace

BOBBY
I want a place where only the vultures will
find him (then) Itll be over soon
Grace

GRACE

Then will you take me on your friends boat
with you

BOBBY
Im not sailing his boat

GRACE
But I thought --

BOBBY
Were going to buy a boat of our own baby
and sail it wherever we want to go
GRACE
Anywhere

BOBBY
What the hell Why not Where should we go

GRACE
Hawaii Ive read all about it Ive
dreamed of going there and just lying on
the beach while the water licked up against
my feet Oh God Id kill to go there

BOBBY
You already have

She gives him a funny look

BOBBY
You know I thought youd left me back
there

GRACE

What are you talking about

BOBBY (emotional)

When I got back from the garage and your
jeep wasnt there I thought youd gone and
left me and taken the money

(off her look)
Cause I never had any luck with women
Grace You dont know what I been through
The shit Ive taken I thought you were
like the rest of ‘em but when you came
out of the house well youre here Grace
and we might be starting in the shit but
were starting where I never been --
together with someone -- together with you
Grace

She responds with a luminous smile

GRACE
I love you Bobby

He looks back at her with trust and love in his eyes

BOBBY
Were gonna pull this off Grace

Just then a HEADLIGHT rakes them from the rear as we hear
again the ominous crackle of a POLICE RADIO and the short
brutal Whoop of the siren as Sheriff Potters VEHICLE rolls
up quickly behind them Graces face is caught like a surprised
deer in the headlamps

GRACE
Oh my God
(then)
Dont stop

Bobby is in a bind The siren whoops again The lights flash to
highbeam

BOBBY
He mustve seen us swerving on the road
thats all just gonna give us a ticket for
swerving

But even Bobby has trouble believing that as the POLICE VEHICLE
pulls out sharply alongside his and SHERIFF POTTER motions to
him aggressively to pull over on the shoulder

SHERIFF (into loudspeaker)
Pull over goddamnit pull over

GRACE
Keep going

She seems to be panicking Bobby pulls over

BOBBY
Fuck thisJust shut up Grace We done
nothing Be cool Let me do the talking He
doesnt know anything

His vehicle pulled up on the shoulder in front of them the
Sheriff gets out shining his power flashlight into their faces

BOBBY (starts)
Evening Sheriff sorry bout that but this
jackrabbit

Bobby has no time to react as the Sheriff is suddenly there at
his window jerking his door open angry A GUN in his hand
pointed at them his eyes on Grace

SHERIFF
You had to fuck him didnt you

GRACE (nervous cool)
I would never do that to you baby He
killed Jake -- said hed kill me if I
didnt come with him All he wants is the
money
Bobby looks at her He cannot believe what he just heard

BOBBY

SHERIFF (flipping yelling)
Dont lie to me

Grace knows the jam is up

GRACE
OKbut he never made me cum Really
Virgil I was only doing what I had to do
so we could be free Just like we talked
about It meant nothing

A pause Virgil wants to kill her but he also wants her back
badly

BOBBY
You fucking him too Grace Is everybody

fucking everybody in this town

She ignores him Her attention on the backpack with the money

between her legs -- the gun is there inside an outer flap of
the bag
SHERIFF
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your

dirty work and you think you can take the
money and dump me

GRACE
No baby you got it wrong

SHERIFF
This road dont go to Globe Grace -- where
were you going to meet me

His flashlight on the four suitcases in the backseat She
doesnt have an answer to that one

GRACE
Its not like that it Look Virgil I
got the money here

She gets out of the car on her side comes around to him the
pack of money slung on her shoulder hard to see in the dark

SHERIFF (hurt)
Oh Grace you can say what you wantbut
I watched you fuck that pervert for years
while youre telling me you loved me What
happened to going to Milwaukee together
You and me -- gonna open up the finest
sporting goods store that city ever did

GRACE
All talk thats all you did was talk and
all I did was sit around getting older
waiting for you to free me You never did

Bobby) He did

The Sheriff deeply wounded casts a hot vicious gaze on Bobby

SHERIFF
This is some girl you and me got here
Bobby yessir an excellent cocksuck too

darling going way back to your crazy mama

GRACE (deadly)

SHERIFF

50000 dollars Its you You Grace or

nothing The whole thing I want you to
be my wife (hopeful) What do you way
Grace

GRACE
You sound just like Jake I did see into

the future Virgil but you werent in it
Go back to your family They love you

Bobby gets out of the car misunderstanding the situation

BOBBY (misunderstanding)
Look we got more We got 200000 at
least Split it three ways we all walk
away

The Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight
knocking him to the ground kicking him again and again
gathering the psychic force to murder him Grace tries to
approach

SHERIFF
Shut up boy You dont know shit round
here (to Grace) Get back Did she tell you
that story about the bird flying away

BOBBY (rolling on the ground)
Ow Look I ow

GRACE
Stop Stop it

SHERIFF (kicking again and again)
Were you going to help her fly away
asshole Whatd you think you were the
first boy to drift through this town she
came on to She tell you the story about
old Jake forcing her to marry him Thats a
good story How he killed her crazy Mama

Bobby in bloody agony Grace stunned that Virgil would reveal
this now publicly

GRACE
Goddamnit Virgil stop Dont

SHERIFF
-But I bet the story she didnt tell you
was the best story of all How old crazy
Jake was really her Papa And she liked
fucking Papa And now shes killed the
sonufabitch Just like shes gonna kill
you

Grace plunges into the pack pulls the gun and shoots Virgil
across the car in the gut

GRACE
Noyou You

The Sheriff flies back onto the road stunned not realizing
whats happened

Bobby watches unbelieving as Grace quietly steps up over the
Sheriff

She puts the next round in his nuts a modern fury enacting
ancient wrath

BOBBY
Grace No
The Sheriff is wide-eyed dying in shock Grace then fires right
at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the
back of his head

Grace and Bobby both stare then Grace jumps into action
dragging the body She snaps to Bobby

GRACE
Help me get him off the road Into the car
Well ditch his car Get the fuck up

Bobby stares at her
EXTINT MUSTANG - NIGHT

Theyre driving GRACE and BOBBY wordless each thinking in
separate worlds Grace wipes her hands The bag with the money
between her legs The Baretta is back in the bag

BOBBY (finally)
Jesus did you have to kill him

GRACE
Get real Bobby He was gonna kill you and
me

BOBBY

He was in love with you Grace He wouldve
done what you wanted you couldve made a
deal and

GRACE
The only deal he had in mind was killing
you for Jakes murder and blackmailing me
into sucking his dick for the rest of my
life no thanks

fq

BOBBY
He was a cop Grace they never stop
looking for you when you kill a cop

GRACE
He was a scumbag He wanted me Bobby
These guys dont let go Even when theyre
dead (softer) You dont know what it was

like Bobby Those two they were the same
A silence The oncoming road

GRACE
So arent you going to ask me
BOBBY
Ask you what You mean what kind of
horrifying sick shit is coming next

GRACE
Dont you want to know I bet its
burning a hole in your brain just now

BOBBY
Let it go baby Its the past I gota
past

GRACE

Dont you really want to know Was Jake my
Daddy Was I fucking my own Daddy Dont
you want to know that

BOBBY (shouting)
What do you want me to say

Shes yelling emotionally out of control

She looks at Bobby forces him to look at her Finally

GRACE
Yes I was I was fucking Daddy And I
married him I married himokay

BOBBY
Why

GRACE
I dont know why

She drops back in her seat Tears come

A pause

GRACE
All I wanted was to be a kid He took
that from me They all did (very

quietly dangerously) They treated me like
meat A piece of meat Fuck me Blow me
Bend over Stick their fingers up my ass
Fuck them Fuck the whole town They
deserved to die

BOBBY
And us Grace What do we deserve

GRACE (crying quietly to herself)
Nin chonk nin chonk my Mama used to say
in Apache Your worst is doing this to
you she said your worst has killed
you And Be go tsee -- you will find
out the result of what you have done
Just when you think its over when youve
gotten away it begins Cause you never get
away

Bobby stares straight ahead at the oncoming road Can he still
love her She seems to be reading his thoughts like she said
she could

GRACE
Its easy to judge someone else when you
dont know nothing about it Im Apache

Bobby You dont eat what I eat You dont
see what I see Dont judge me

A silence Two former lovers in the dark of a car moving through
the strangeness of an Arizona desert at night

BOBBY
I dont want to think anymore

GRACE (quietly)
Then drive

The lights of the car fade until there is nothing but darkness
THE SUN COMES UP
EXT CANYON - END SPOT - DAWN

In the vast reaches of a deserted canyon where VULTURES circle
in a hot white sky we find the MUSTANG parked at the edge of a
drop We hear the SOUND of a body being dragged

DJ (VO)
-Nobodys sure where it was heading so
fast but the way it hit the semi it wont
be getting home now Hey area weather is
gonna be hot Hot Hot Then cold Cold
Cold Just like yesterday Just like every
day Some surprise huh So if youre
planning on anything dont You dont like
the weather just wait one minute Got any
brains get up to Alaska and get yourself
some trailer park where you dont see no
desert for miles and miles

BOBBY (over)
Right there Drop it there I got it

BOBBY is giving GRACE instructions as they drop SHERIFF VIRGIL
POTTERS corpse over a drop onto some rocks 30 yards below

GRACE
See ya Virgil God bless

Bobby pushes him over his hand hurting The body crashes below
Its hard work They head back for the Mustang to retrieve
JAKES body in the popped trunk But Grace notices Bobby
glancing at the Baretta now tucked in her waist

The silence is tense between them the rocks and gravel
crunching under their shoes as they walk

GRACE (indicates the gun)
Is this whats bothering you Bobby

BOBBY
No Grace my hands bothering me

GRACE
You think now that Jakes dead theres all
that money there and I dont need you
anymore and I might just sneak up behind
you sometime andpop

She pulls an imaginary trigger on Bobby mimicking the recoil of
a gun Bobby is nervous

GRACE
Dont you think I wouldve done it if I wanted
to What can I do to make you relax baby

BOBBY
You could give me my gun back

Grace smiles

GRACE
Why dont we just finish what we started

She stares down at Jake She cant help feeling some old
feelings As Bobby walks back to the front of the car turns off
the annoying radio He watches as she softly prays over Jake
whose face is concealed by the blanket in which he is rolled

GRACE (after a moment with Jake)
What do you think happens to someones
spirit when they die
BOBBY
I think nothing happens Youre dead meat

Thats it

GRACE
You dont believe in anything do you
Bobby

BOBBY

I believe in this moment thats all There
is nothing else

(lifting Jake by the shoulder)
Come on He must weigh 300 pounds

Grace leans into the trunk to take his boots when he makes his
move quickly closing on her when shes off guard He slams her
hard in the face coldly sending her sprawling to the ground
dazed

He steps over her and grabs the gun in her waist checks it

She puts her hand to her mouth feels the blood on her finger
tips She looks at him and laughs a wild crazed laugh that cuts
into Bobby like a knife

GRACE
You hit me Bobby You hit a woman you
motherfucker Didnt your Momma ever teach
you anything

Her eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing Her
calm is extraordinary as if expecting to die

GRACE
Well

For a moment Bobby does nothing then he slips the gun through
his belt

BOBBY
Well nothing We dump Jake we split the
money then youre on your own

GRACE
Dont leave me I want to say with you
Bobby

BOBBY

Why So when the cops catch up with us you
can sell me out again

GRACE
I was just baiting him Bobby I had to
tell him that to get his guard down Just
like you told Jake you was going to kill
me

BOBBY
You lied to me all along Lies all lies
Your mother your father what story are
you on now How come the town didnt know
you was his daughter

GRACE (in pain)
Cause my Mom slept around A lotta men
Anybody couldve been my father But we
knew

BOBBY (not listening)
Well you got what you wanted all along by
fucking me I wish you had told me the
goddamn truth in the first place

GRACE (screws out)
I didnt want you to know Dont you
unnerstand

Bobbys got a headache now Its too much to understand too
much talk Too much history has taught him to doubt

BOBBY

When youre finished with me Im next I
been there baby I been there with other
cuntssorry not anymore Ill take you
as far as California If we can make that
After that youre on your own Try Mexico
With all this bread you can live like a
queen

GRACE
I dont want to go to Mexico Bobby
Please I really want to be with you Dont
blow this Dont you think I care about
you

BOBBY
I think youre a lying back-stabbing
psycho bitch and one day youll kill me
But its nice to know you cared

The expression on Graces face changes as rapidly as the desert
weather a coldness passing over and through her

GRACE
You dont know your own mind It blocks
your heart

Keeping a wary eye on Grace Bobby starts hauling Jake out of
the trunk

BOBBY
Give me a hand

He wrestles Jake up to a sitting position He grabs a can of
beer from a warm six-pack in the trunk and shoves it into a
pocket of Jakes coat

BOBBY
Poor old Jake a few drinks a fight with
the sheriff over his wife And both of em
ended up dead

Grace takes his boots

BOBBY
Time to go for a walk Jake

GRACE
My mother died in this canyon

BOBBY
Save the Mom routine will ya Grace It
doesnt work with me One two three

They lift the corpse and with great effort haul it towards the
edge of the drop As they pause on the way Bobby wary of
Graces strange coldness tries to soften the blow of
separation

BOBBY
Look its not so bad we split up It might
be months before they find these guys If
at all I mean with the mountain lions
around here Remember if they cant find
no bodies theres no crime (She doesnt
respond) Well be in Phoenix by noon Lose
this car get another one Texas Mexico
are big countries all that money Grace
youll meet someone else you know theres
a lot of hope with a 100000

They lift Jake again and move to the edge

GRACE
Hope is a four-letter word
BOBBY
But we all need that too Hold him

He props Jake at the edge standing and transfers the weight
onto Grace Jakes head is on her shoulder

BOBBY
You make a pretty couple

It seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun
wipes it of his prints and slips it through Jakes belt

BOBBY
Won this in a poker game in Reno God knows
who its registered to You shoulda been
more careful Jake See you later

As he takes Jakes weight off Grace and pushes it over the drop

Grace watches him go her eyes shifting to Bobby his back
momentarily to her also watching She moves towards him

Bobby turns slips on the edge

BOBBY
Now all we got to do is try and--

He feels a blur of motion almost like a bird and he is
fallingfalling his life coming to an end

Grace is standing somewhere up above briefly seen Did she push
him He doesnt know

Hes stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of Jake
and Virgil He screams out in sharp pain His leg feels broken
But he is alive

Grace walks away cutting it all off deeply shaken She must
get away from the past and all these hollow men She closes the
trunk of the Mustang gets in the drivers seat reaches for the
ignition key Her hand fumbles for it a moment It isnt there

GRACE

Shit
She sits there Bobby is calling from below

BOBBY
Grace Help me Grace We been through
too much together Weve only had one day
but you and me have been through more than
most people ever will I know you were
angry at me and you know you were right
Im sorry I hit you I was wrong about
leaving you You dont belong in Mexico

She finally gets out and walks back to the edge of the cliff
looks down

BOBBY
Thank you Thank you II knew you
wouldnt leave me Grace

GRACE
Bobby Are you all right

BOBBY
I busted my leg

GRACE
Can you make it back up

BOBBY
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow
rope It should reach down here Go get it
throw it down

She looks Of course the trunk is closed She closed it

GRACE
Bobby the trunkits locked Throw the
keys up to me Ill get the rope

Bobbys eyes pass over Jake a few feet away his eyes staring
upwards in death They take in the gun still attached to his
waist He knows the trunk wasnt locked when they took Jake out

BOBBY
I cant throw that far You got to climb
down here and get the keys You can make
it Its the only way Grace

Grace looks down at the drop Its a tough descent but she
knows she could make it and get back up as well

BOBBY
GracePlease Grace You have to help
me

Grace takes a look around

GRACE
Okay Im coming Calm down
She starts down the cliff face As she descends he talks
deliriously

BOBBY (off)
I knew youd help me I knew you wouldnt
leave me baby cause were tied together
too close We belong together always

Grace makes it to the bottom of the drop and walks cautiously
towards Bobby

GRACE (yelling back echoing)
Bobby Dont flip out on me I cant do
this alone I know you dont trust me but
you gotta pull yourself together Im not
gonna leave youI never wanted it to go
down like this It was different with you
Bobby You had dreams like me You
listened I wouldve gone anywhere with
you Bobby We can make this work Im
sorryI really am I didnt wanna hurt
you

Can he believe her She sounds so sincere this time

Shes heading for the body of Jake And the gun Bobby knows
that and is already crawling there

BOBBY (as he crawls)
Theyre right here Grace The keys Come
get me out of here Know why else I could
never leave you

GRACE
Whys that

BOBBY
Cause I love you

Inching closer
Closer They meet at the apex of Jakes corpse

GRACE
And I love you too

BOBBY
And loves a funny thing Sometimes I
dont know if I want to love you

Grace leans close to Bobby He dangles the keys out in front of
her but she doesnt reach for them Her eyes go to Bobby She
reaches for him At that instant Bobbys hands shoot out and
clamp hard around her A sharp gurgle is all that escapes Grace
as Bobby twists the life from her as Jake leers up at them

BOBBY
»or kill you

Grace twists and flails in Bobbys hands but in spite of his
bleeding stump he holds her like a bear trap holds a grizzly

BOBBY
I love you Grace but I just cant trust
you

She looks at him trying to protest shaking her head Graces
flailing goes into overdrive Somewhere in his semi-delirious
state Bobbys eyes might notice the gun at Jakes waist is no
longer there

Grace manages one word

GRACE
Jake

BOBBY
He cant help you now honey

Bobby is in agony as he kills her part beast part lover he
kills that which he loves

Suddenly a SHOT is heard Bobby buckles with the blast hit in
the side He kills her with one last wrenching thrust of his
hands breaking her neck

Bobby looks down at Jakes gun which she clutches in her hand
and sees the hole in his side and the river of blood that flows
from it He manages to stand looks at Jake their bodies lying
side by side

Bobby with great difficulty claws his way back up the rocks to
the car his fast-flowing wound staining the white rocks with
blood

He makes it to the top and losing more blood climbs into the
drivers seat He checks the money in the bag All there All
his

As he pulls a huge clot of blood from his side the vultures
circle Perhaps one smarter than the others lands close by It
spooks Bobby but hes okay He looks in the mirror

BOBBY
Youre still lucky
He puts the key in the ignition the engine comes to life

BOBBY (waves back)
Adios --

Suddenly the RADIATOR HOSE Darrell installed blows apart
loudly Bobby knows exactly and immediately what it is as a
cloud of steam now rolls from under his hood He shakes his
head frustrated

BOBBY (sighs)
Oh shit( (then) Arizona

He cant help but laugh at his bad luck As we rise off the
desert floor and take flight with the vultures eventually
leaving them all as specks of earth in the vast empty canyons of
Arizona

THE END
