INT CHEVS BEDROOM MORNING

This scene plays out as a continuous POV shot right up
until CHEVs face is revealed for the first time)

CHEV CHELIOS wakes up in his apartment to a RINGING
PHONE groggy vision doubled

feel right dont want to move right

The CELL PHONE coming from some other room plays the

Its RICKY VERONA on the SCREEN a young irritatingly
slick

EASTERN EURO little to no accent - fast talking

sarcastic a complete dick

We see him sitting on CHEVS bed CHEV is visible in
the

frame unconscious behind VERONA Pale nicotine
sunlight

filters in through the blinds There are HOODS
loitering

around the room It was apparently shot only hours
before

(

The discernible sound of CHEVS heartbeat will
subliminally

increase in speed and volume throughout VERONAS
monologue -

the cell phone continues to ring somewhere)

VERONA
Whats shaking douchebag Thought Id
give you the heads up Youre dead

On the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA

VERONA (CONTD)
Yeah thats right you little bitch
if youre watching this tape it means
that I somehow resisted the urge to
dismember you and shove the pieces down
the garbage disposal opting instead
to poison you in your sleep Yeah you
around

AND

CHEV is 5

still

heard me
We stay with CHEVS POV as he flashes a frantic glance
the room The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER
FASTER NOW we really begin to notice it
VERONA (CONTD)
I fucking poisoned you in your sleep
How sick is that for the satisfaction
of watching you squirm out your last
minutes knowing it was me that did it to
you and theres nothing you can do about
it
Cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera
on his knees in front of the set looking around we
dont see his face clearly
VERONA (CONTD)
thats right youre on candid
camera try not to embarrass yourself

Cut back to CHEVS POV He holds his head down over the

carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth GAGGING

VERONA (CONTD)

Let me guess youre trying to puke the
shit out right Right Dont bother

even I dont know exactly what the fuck
it is All I know is once it binds with
your blood cells youre fucked baby
and believe me its done binded By now
youll be feeling your joints stiffen
up hard to breath

CHEV puts his hand on the left side of his chest to

heart The BEATS of the heart grow louder still but

rhythm falters begins to slow

VERONA (VO) (CONTD)
your heartbeat is slowing down like

theres rust in your veins youre like
the Tin Man in the Wizard of freaking

One of the THUGS ALEX contributes from offscreen

singing)

Scarecrow Whatever You get the point
Youre fucked You got maybe an hour

The THUGS are into it VERONA is rolling One of them
up beside the bed and plants a big kiss on CHEVS
head
VERONA (CONTD)
Hey its been real Probably shouldve
thought twice before you whacked Don Kim
Experiencing a little 2020 hindsight I
thought so Have a nice death
Finally the CAMERA reverses to reveal CHEVS slack-

face staring at the TV CHEV is in his late 20s

a BONE-BREAKING CRUSH

He KICKS over the rest of the entertainment system

it and heads out of the room

ROLLER DOLLY follows him on a STUMBLING RAMPAGE through
apartment and down the hall

By the door in an ashtray with his car keys he finds
his God-damned CELL PHONE Of course it stops ringing
as he picks it up He pockets it BANGS OPEN the front
and is out

INT CHEVS APARTMENT BUILDING CONTINUOUS

ROLLER DOLLY stays with him through the door and down

SLAMS IT SHUT terrified - and then down the stairs to

spot
walks right over it and hops off clicking the keyless

and busts into the joint

INT BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE CONTINUOUS

The continuous ROLLER DOLLY move takes us inside and

GOING Eight or ten BROTHERS some wearing motorcycle
leathers are scattered around the room shooting

drinking etc CHEV BARGES IN drawing a GLOK 45 from
coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black hip 30s
dressed than the others - who is at the center of a
BADASSES

efore anyone has time to react CHEV has the GUN
ORLANDOS FOREHEAD and is pushing him through the place
the bathroom Everyone scatters and takes cover at the

of the GLOK firearms appear

CHEV locks the door SLAMS ORLANDO against the far wall and
starts circling around him with the gun beaded on ORLANDOS
forehead

CHEV

CHEV

he is or Im going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS
INTO THAT TOILET

The DOOR BUSTS OPEN and a half dozen gun wielding BROTHERS
crowd into the tiny room

otal mad chaos ensues CHEV ORLANDO and the BROTHERS
packed

in like sardines everyone pointing guns at every one elses

head shoving each other back and forth everyone screaming

The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of

bloody violence

Finally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice

ORLANDO
THE WHITE MAN IS COOL THE WHITE MAN IS
CooL
Ss
ILENCE - just the sound of CHEVS heartbeat pumping

ORLANDO (CONTD)
(calmly)
Can we all just get along Can we
Beat CHEVS gun is still trained on ORLANDOS head

ORLANDO (CONTD)
Now Chevy here has something he would
like to discuss So we are going to
discuss it In a civilized manner
Chevy I believe you had a question or
some point you were trying to make

CHEV
Wheres Verona

ORLANDO
OK I am not affiliated with Ricky
Verona

CHEV
(starting to lose it again)
You pulled the Anselmo job together

He presses closer to ORLANDO the BROTHERS bristle
the

situation is close to blowing up again

T

c

ORLANDO
Easy easy now things are
beginning to clarify you see how that

works How discussion can lead to
clarity
HEV is running out of patience

ORLANDO (CONTD)
Clearly you are operating under a false
pretense Ricky Verona and myself did
not pull the Anselmo job together In
fact Ricky Verona fucked me on the
Anselmo job In fact Ricky Verona owes
me seventy five hunna dollars

CHEV
Thats not how I heard it

ORLANDO
But thats the way it is Thats the way
it is So you see I dont know where
Ricky Verona is Because if I knew where
he is I would probably be there right
now beating his Gucci ass down
Ss
tandoff CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand studying
ORLANDOS eyes evaluating

hen as much from exhaustion as from a sense that hes
telling the truth he lets his gun hand drop

CHEV
Alright

The room lets out a collective exhale The BROTHERS mutter
amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit
away crazy bitch ass mother

ORLANDO
Thank you Thats what Im talking
about That resembles civility

LUB DUB LUB DUB LUB DUB
CHEV begins to fade again He slumps back looking as though
he might pass out One of the BROTHERS catches him holds

him up and shoves him away

ORLANDO (CONTD)
Shit dude whats the matter with you

CHEV
Forget it I just gotta find Ricky
Verona that little bitch

ORLANDO
I understand that Youve made that
point abundantly clear to all of us

He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit A few of
the BROTHERS lose interest begin to filter out of the room

ORLANDO (CONTD)
Now what can I do to help you

CHEV

tosses it into the sink Hes visibly fading
ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad pulls a little
plastic bag out of his vest pocket tosses it to CHEV The
bag hits CHEV square in the forehead hits sweat and STICKS
CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the
floor His reflexes are not the best at this point
CHEV collapses to his knees breaks it open and snorts it
right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees The
BROTHERS find this hilarious
ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust
ORLANDO (CONTD)

We hear CHEVS heart rate start to build increase in
volume

Suddenly he pops up to his feet almost slips and falls

cat and mouse in the maze of sewing machines and
while the SUPERVISOR oblivious continues screaming
forcing the workers back into their chairs

CHEV puts a finger to EVES lips calming her

then comes up behind a youngish HOOD and shoves
HOODS gun hand under a vicious looking sewing machine

avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit CHEV grabs
her hand and yanks her along

He spots EVES CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and

they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND
RICOCHET off the pavement

EVE is rifling through her purse as they run Naturally CHEV
assumes shes looking for the CAR KEYS

FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of
ASIANS on his blind side who are CUT TO RIBBONS by

of CARLITOS MEN and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE

CARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his
GOONS using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the
bar the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets
