Marilyn puts her hand on Harvey’s to calm him down

HARVEY

HUTCH

Okay Since I have yet to clearly
define my career path it makes
smart business sense especially in
these tough economic times to
evaluate the various opportunities
out there So why not take a year
off really research this thing
and “find myself” Then bang I’m
back in school heading toward a
career and a life filled with huge
financial rewards and tons of
emotional stability To top things
off you guys won’t have to worry
about cash if things get really
bad ‘Ol Hutch here will
unselfishly be able to provide for
the whole family and we’1ll live
happily ever after

decision

like watered down near beer and the
marketing has no appeal to anyone
under fifty No hot chicks in the
ads sponsorship at sporting events
or cool dudes in movies chugging
it Just some lame old top-hat dude
on the brink of death The bottom
line is that Hibrau sucks and
everything associated with it makes
me think of my great grandfather
And he’s dead”

That’s awesome It’ll get you
canned for sure Maybe even sued

years I respect what we represent
I would never say these things

came from H Hutchinson

HARVEY
(leans in whispers)
That’s my son Hutch He’s been
working in the warehouse I
apologize-

BRACKEN
Well then it seems that things
have taken an interesting turn

INT HIBRAU BREWING CO - BREWERY - LATER

Bracken reads Hutch’s email out loud to the entire company
Harvey stands off to the side cringing with every word

BRACKEN
“and the marketing has no appeal
to anyone under fifty No hot
chicks in the ads sponsorship at
sporting events or cool dudes in
movies chugging it Just some lame
old top-hat dude on the brink of
death”

HARVEY
(sotto)
I am so screwed

“The bottom line is that Hibrau
sucks and everything associated
with it makes me think of my great
grandfather And he’s dead”
(he scans the crowd)

boys drink a lot of beer and these

BRACKEN
It’s brilliant The everyman’s
perspective Real beer drinkers

Hutch is baffled as is Harvey

BRACKEN
It’s about time someone has the
guts to address why this company is
in the toilet Desperate times call
for desperate measures It’s time
to take a fresh approach and turn
things around

HUTCH
Hey buddy

MAITRE D’
(major attitude)
Beat it kid Were not hiring

HUTCH
Excuse me

MAITRE D’
Dishwasher positions are filled
Now you and your cell mates scamper
back to where you came from

Warburton clenches his fist Hutch holds him back

HUTCH
That’s too bad Maybe there’s
another position available Dish
washing for me is just a stepping
stone to my ultimate goal

MAITRE D’
And what may I ask would that be

HUTCH
Having your job

Maitre D’ chuckles

HUTCH
Do you think if I work hard enough
someday I could be up here like
you lookin’ sharp and being in
charge

MAITRE D’
Highly doubtful

Maitre D’ starts to walk away Hutch stops him and points
over to some YOUNG LOOKING GIRLS up at the bar

HUTCH
See if I had your job I’d make
sure that punks like me wouldn’t
come in here and spot those two
underage honey’s at the bar
Because punks like me might call
the cops and have your liquor
license pulled How bad would that
suck But the flip side is that
then there would be a job opening
Yours

Hutch whips out a business card and flicks it at him

HUTCH
So if you want to keep your job I
suggest you lose the attitude and
get us a table

Maitre D’ scans the card

HUTCH
And if you’d like me to replace
those Hibrau beer taps with Old
Milwaukee I can make that happen
as well

Maitre D’ fumbles grabs a stack of menus

MAITRE D’
Yes sir Right away

you doing over at Hibrau

HUTCH
I basically try to figure out ways
to sell more beer

WARBURTON
Like a bartender

HUTCH
Sort of but on a much bigger
scale

WARBURTON
Sounds complicated

HUTCH
Not really At first I had no clue
what was going on But then I
realized no one else there has a
clue either so I just go with my

gut

WARBURTON
Just keep doing whatever it is that
you do

Don’t be modest son You’re a
hero

HUTCH

Well I have always said just cook
me up a curve ball and Ill blast
it out of the kitchen

The room claps Harvey bites his tongue

BRACKEN
As you all know the last quarter
was solid Sales have been creeping
back up and efficiency is at an all
time high

Bracken winks at Hutch who shrugs modestly

BRACKEN
But we need to keep pushing What
do you marketing boys have for me

Phil stands He holds up a cardboard display of Old-Jones
holding a cat in one hand and a frothy beer mug in the other
It reads “Two friends are better than one”

PHIL
These are going in beer aisles
across the country

Harvey presents a mock up of the HIBRAU MOBILE BAR TRUCK a
custom semi that converts into a bar “Hibrau your friend at
the MILWAUKEE COUNTY FALL FESTIVAL is painted on the side

HARVEY
We’ve got the new mobile set-up
ready for this years Fall Festival
Well be doing promotional
giveaways and event sponsorships

BRACKEN
Looks good Hutchinson Pittman

PITTMAN
I’ve put together a new radio
jingle for that younger demographic
weve been discussing It’s gonna
knock your sandals off

Pittman opens the door In walks a group of HARD-CORE
RAPPERS dressed like NWA

PITTMAN
Hit it guys

The FAT RAPPER starts to human beat box But instead of
freestyling the other Rappers huddle together and harmonize
like a white-bread BARBERSHOP QUARTET

RAPPERS
“When you’re near the end and you
need a friend reach for the blend
that will put you on the mend It’s
Hibrau yes Hibrau”
FAT RAPPER
“Hibrau Lager Milwaukee’s loyal
friend since 1883”

It’s so ridiculous it almost makes sense

BRACKEN
What do you think Hutch

HUTCH
You want to know the truth sir

BRACKEN
Give it to me son

HUTCH
We’re not thinking outside the box
This is the same old stuff
recycled If we want to get the
younger demo we have to compete
with the big boys We’re gonna need
to get in the ring with them

HARVEY
Arthur weve done extensive market
research and-

BRACKEN
Tell me more Hutch

Harvey sits back defeated

HUTCH
Look at Miller or Bud You go toa
Brewers Bucks or Packers game
they’re plastered everywhere They
sponsor concerts wet t-shirt
contests TV shows and movies
They’re so planted in my brain that
I buy the stuff without even
thinking about it and so do all my
friends

HARVEY
Our budgets are nowhere close to
what they have

HUTCH
Then maybe we need to start small
See how it goes Mix it up a little
and try something new

Bracken likes the sound of all this

BRACKEN
I’1l give you people two weeks to
come up with new marketing ideas
Impress me with something fresh and
unique and we’ll implement it

Hutch gives Harvey the thumbs up He returns it with a scowl

BRACKEN
Next order of business

Bracken waves to someone outside of the glass walled
conference room Sargent Heinrick the Nazi-like security
guard enters carrying a hard-shelled briefcase

BRACKEN
Sargent Heinrick is going to give
you an update on my Bentley I will
not rest until this scum of the
earth is brought to justice

Heinrick walks around the table white gloving the backs of
the chairs

SGT HEINRICK
Thank you Mr Bracken We have
some new evidence that I would like
to share with you

He pops open the briefcase and extracts a video tape He pops
the tape into a VCR at the front of the room A grainy black
and white image of the parking lot appears

Harvey sweats it up

SGT HEINRICK

We have security camera footage
from the day of the incident
Initially it was deemed useless due
to the angle of the lens But I
consulted with a forensic crime lab
and through the use of infrared
video overlay simulation we may be
able to identify the culprit

Harvey speaks up

HARVEY
Maybe it was an accident

SGT HEINRICK
There are no accidents

He pops out the tape and puts it in the briefcase

SGT HEINRICK
The process will take several weeks
and we expect positive results I’m
taking the tape over there this
afternoon

BRACKEN
Good work Sargent Heinrick We’1l
catch this son of a bitch And when
we do I’1l chop off his balls and
toss them into the malt brewer

UNDER THE TABLE - Harvey crosses his legs

He GRABS IT and ZAAAAAP 250000 VOLTS rip through Harvey
He spins spasmodically and FLIPS out an OPEN WINDOW

The briefcase flies out of his hand landing back on the file

chain and disables the security shock on the case BEEP BEEP
He picks it up and exits the office

EXT HUTCHINSON HOME - EVENING

Harvey’s in the driveway unloading some kind of ANIMAL
COSTUME out of his car

He’s STARTLED by the sound of a custom car horn that BLASTS
to the tune of Chamillionaire’s “RIDIN DIRTY”

He turns to see HUTCH IN THE BENZ waving for him to move so
he can pull into the driveway Harvey does so reluctantly

Hutch pulls in and hops out He hits a button on the alarm
remote and the Benz lowers to the ground and the doors
automatically close

HUTCH
Pretty sweet huh Warburton

everyone out of the water

BRACKEN
Okay who’s next

Harvey and Phil gather up their stack of presentation

boards

HARVEY
Today we’re going to present to you
the next generation in Hibrau
marketing Although our budget is
limited Phil and I have been able
to secure a sponsorship deal that
will put the Hibrau name in front
of millions of potential new
customers in an arena that up ‘till
now has only been accessible to the
big boys at Miller and Budweiser

Harvey holds up a poster board showing a pack of NASCAR cars
racing around track He gives Hutch an “I gotcha now” smirk

HARVEY
These “supercharged billboards”
race each week at tracks around the
country and are amongst the highest
rated events in sports television

Phil hands him another poster board

HARVEY
Through savvy negotiations we have
secured a deal with NASCAR
superstar Mark Martin

Harvey turns over the poster board that shows the Mark Martin
racing car

HIBRAU RACING SUIT He’s accompanied by a bruised up Teddy
Riley and Warburton sporting “Hibrau Racing Team swag

JEFF GORDON
“Hibrau the number one choice of
real NASCAR fans”

The jaws in the room are all on the floor Harvey’s nut sack

more importantly some kind of
freakish brotherly bond born out of
barbaric male-bonding my man Gordo
here has agreed to become part of
the Hibrau family

Hutch presents a mini scale model of the new HIBRAU RACING
CAR The room APPLAUDS Harvey is a mess

JEFF GORDON
It’s an honor to be part of this
