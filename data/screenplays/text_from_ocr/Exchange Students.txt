actually did it

Sitowski

MR JONES
I concur

MR CORDDRY

winners leave winners Show up losers
that’s how they graduate BUT What if
we could change that Put ‘em on new
paths Switch them

COACH RIGGLE
Make that dweeb popular Impossible

MS BEE
I like this idea It’s why I got into
teaching It’s what we’re supposed to
do Sculpt them Change their future

MR CORDDRY
Exactly

Barry picks ROTTEN LETTUCE from his hair

COACH RIGGLE
That kid’s got the confidence of a mouse
in an python cage

MR CORDDRY
So we give him confidence I say I
say we can do it by semester’s end

MS BEE
Like a sociology project

MR JONES
It would break the monotony

COACH RIGGLE
Why not The good Lord hath bestowed us
