living room gives up and walks out into a patio An electric
blue pool empty waiting for a swimmer

little something hidden up every sleeve He moves to a sofa

HECTOR

EXT QUEENS STREET -- NIGHT

Hector comes to serenade her in the middle of the night To
ask for forgiveness in the only way he knows how or the way
he dopes it best A guitar and maracaslike an old

fashioned trio from a time warp in the sidewalks of Queens

Hector singing the most romantic and heartbreaking bolero in
life Willie is with himragged trombone moans and all

Puchi eventually comes out the windownodding hushing him
firstthen pretending to be forgivingjust in time for
the neighbors to become a selected audience to a love trial -
put to music as Hector sings soulfully Tito Rodriguezs
heart-breaking Inolvidable

But this alone will not do the trick
INSIDE THE HOUSE ( different exterior LOCATION )
Puchi listens Hector explains Hector

HECTOR
--Im sorry babywhat else do you
want me to do

She just lets him hang in that awful space a little bit
longer

HECTOR (CONTD)

gesturefinished with his defense and ready for sentencing

He trembles shakes silently begging for a fix to at least
patch things up with himself and go through madness with
some dignity

on a solo He sees Puchi coming in His face changes into

fearbecause he sees something in her eyes hes never seen
before

like a zombieVINTAGE MADNESSwith a twist Heads turn
People laugh But its not funny Hector imagines the worst

Hector motions to a BOUNCER who steps in and grabs her
Its another degrading moment

PUCHI

pull the bouncer to spit him to kiss her to spit him
againtaunting the man like a sloppy drunk nothing sexy
about it She is dragged off screaming and foaming at the
mouthbut this time is differentits difficult

where Hector and Puchi are having it out in front of all the
other band members crew strangers

They fight but we dont hear a soundweve heard plenty
of fighting and can only imagine There is no truce ever
with these two

ALL THE SOUNDS FADE OUT

wavesand the barely audible music from a bar blocks away

INT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

The door opens to the empty suite Eerily quiet now Hector
walks in At the end of the room we see the empty balcony
(a REPRISE of once in the late 60s) He walks through

the room opens the sliding door Hector steps outside

EXT SUITE BALCONY -- NIGHT

beneath him the palm trees Listens to the wavesand

his eyes BEFORE THEY SHUT TIGHT
