I’VE LOVED YOU
SO LONG

PHILIPPE CLAUDEL
1 INT AIRPORT CAFETERIA - DAY
A cafeteria in a quiet airport in the provinces Few passers-by

A single woman in her mid-40s (JULIETTE) sits at a table Sips
coffee Gazes around her as if discovering something new — she
often has an expression of eager surprise as if seeing things
people places for the first time ever

She seems uncomfortable in the clothes she is wearing At her feet
is an old-fashioned suitcase

A younger woman (LEA early 30s) appears behind Juliette Less than
a meter away

Juliette hasn’t noticed her Clearly deeply moved Léa quietly
observes her for a few seconds

Then sensing a presence Juliette looks round

Léa leans forward and hugs her tight before Juliette has time to
react Juliette is slightly taken aback

She doesn’t return the hug at first Then awkwardly puts her arms
round Léa

2 INT LEA’S CAR - DAY
Léa is driving

Next to her Juliette tugs at the sleeves of her sweater

LEA
Is it too big

JULIETTE
No

LEA
I like that sweater The skirt too I
often wear them

Juliette doesn’t reply

LEA
I thought it would be better to wait
until you arrived to go shopping for
clothes

Léa glances at Juliette

Beat

There’s something out of place about Juliette She even sits oddly
in the car seat as if unused to it

LEA
Did you have a good trip

JULIETTE
I don’t like flying
Léa glances at her again

JULIETTE
Have you lived here long

LEA
Ten years I finished my PhD here met
Luc got married was offered the
job The usual stuff

Juliette is silent
The CAMERA lingers on her face

3 INT LEA’S HOUSE - DAY
Léa shows Juliette into the house

LEA
Welcome to our kingdom The kitchen’s
over there with the living room
opposite our home offices and a
library at the far end Upstairs
there’s just bedrooms Do you want to
see yours

Juliette replies by a slight nod and the flicker of a smile
Léa leads the way up the stairs

On the first landing she shows Juliette into a room

LEA
Will it be okay

JULIETTE
Fine

LEA
That little door leads to your private
bathroom
(glances at her watch)
Yikes I have to pick up the girls
Ill be back in half an hour Will you
be okay on your own

Juliette nods

Léa hurries out On the landing she stops in her tracks
Slowly retraces her step looks at Juliette and says in a serious
tone

LEA
I’m glad you’re here
Léa gives Juliette a kiss on the cheek and goes
Juliette is expressionless

OS feet dashing down the stairs The jangle of keys
LEA (0S)
Take a look round the house if you
want

The front door thunks closed

Juliette hasn’t moved an inch
She remains motionless like that for a long Moment

4 INT LEA’S HOUSE - DAY
MONTAGE of Juliette’s tour of the house
In the living room she strokes a cat dozing on a chair

In a study she runs her hand over the back of a couch Gazes at
framed photos

In the kitchen she pours herself a glass of water Drinks slowly
leaning back against the fridge

Upstairs Juliette opens a door A child’s bedroom She closes the
door hurriedly

She opens another door A library full of books With a single bed
and two chairs Sitting in one of the chairs an elderly man is
reading

JULIETTE
Im sorry I I didn’t think anyone
was home

The old man looks up without a word and smiles at her
JULIETTE

I My name’s Juliette I’m Léa’s
sister

Still not a word Just a kindly smile
JULIETTE
Like I said I’m very sorry

Smiling the old man goes back to his book as if indifferent to
her presence

5 EXTINT LEA’S HOUSE - DAY

Léa closes the back door of the car She has a two-year-old girl
(EMELIA) in her arms

Another little girl (CLELIS known as Little Lili) waits on the
sidewalk She looks 8-9 years old Both girls are Asian

LEA
Lili open the gate will you You
know it’s hard when I’m carrying
Emelia

They go through the gate into the small front garden
LILI

Is Auntie Juliette going to stay with
us forever
LEA
No sweetheart just some time Be
nice to her okay She’s tired Don’t
pester her

They enter the house
LEA
Juliette It’s us

Juliette comes down the stairs The kids gaze up at her
As soon as she reaches the bottom step Lili rushes over

LILI
Hello Auntie

Juliette seems quite distant or maybe just ill at ease

Lili stands on tiptoes to give her a kiss
Juliette hesitates fractionally before giving her a kiss back

Emelia gurgles the word “Auntie” repeatedly

LEA
These are my two princesses Clélis —
but everybody calls her Little Lili —
and little miss Emelia Give Juliette
a nice smile sweety

LILI
Auntie come and see my bedroom

LEA
Don’t start Go straight into the
kitchen There’s milk and biscuits on
the table Chop chop

The two girls run off into the kitchen

LEA
Did you look round the house

JULIETTE
Yes I I went into the library
There was an old man

LEA
Of course silly me I should have
warned you That’s Luc’s father

LILI (0S)
(yells)
Papy Paul His brain’s gone all mushy
and he lost his tongue

LEA
Lili He had a bad stroke three years
ago He hasn’t spoken a word since He
spends all day reading You’1ll see
he’s a lovely man

6 INT KITCHEN - EVENING

Dinner time The whole family is round the table Léa the two
girls Juliette Papy Paul — smiling dumbly — and Luc Léa’s
husband also in his early-mid 30s

The two young girls are very excited

Léa makes a big effort to seem relaxed

Juliette still seems a little strange as if everything is new to
her

And Luc just seems a bit uptight

LUC
Have you ever been to the Lorraine
region before

JULIETTE
No this is the first time

LUC
Everybody thinks it’s just like being
in Germany that it’s freezing cold
all the time

LILI
It is

LUC
Not all the time

LEA
Just eat your dinner

JULIETTE
Were you born here

LUC
Yes but my Dad comes from Poland He
arrived after the war Isn’t that
right Dad

The old man merely smiles a little more insistently than usual

LEA
Luc’s Mum was Russian He married a
girl who’s half-French half-English
And our two daughters are Viet It’s
all the colors of Benetton in this
house

LILI
You’ve lost your accent Mummy but
Auntie Juliette still has one
LEA
Well she grew up in England

LUC
Anybody see the water jug

LEA

Katrina broke it and I haven’t had
time to buy another

(to Juliette)
Katrina’s the cleaner She comes every
Thursday Hide anything fragile She’s
always breaking things That’s why we
call her Katrina Because she leaves a
trail of devastation behind her Her
real name’s Marie-Paule

JULIETTE
(to Luc)
Léa said you do research at the
university

LEA
(jokily)
You two sound like we’re at a party
full of strangers

LILI
Daddy’s a lexicolographer

LUC
Lexicographer’s good enough for me
Our unit is working on an interactive
intuitive dictionary that can be
reactivated in real time

LEA
It’s you guys that need to reactivate
In seven years they’ve only got to
‘C’ Even the Académie Frangaise goes
faster than that

LUC
There’s no comparison That reminds
me there was a message on the machine
from one of your students a guy
called Bamaké or Bakamé something
like that A problem with his marks I
think

LEA
Bamakalé I don’t believe it He won’t
give up

LILI
Why didn’t we ever meet you before
Auntie

Everyone falls silent
Juliette doesn’t know what to say Luc glances anxiously at Léa

The two girls don’t seem to notice Papy Paul keeps on eating
smiling away

JULIETTE
I was away For a very long time

Léa changes the subject A little too quickly
She hands Juliette a dish

LEA
Do you want some more

JULIETTE
No thanks

LEA
Don’t you like it

JULIETTE
It’s very good but

LILI
Where were you away

LUC
(snaps )
Is this some kind of interrogation
Leave your aunt in peace Eat

7 INT LEA and LUC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Léa and Luc are ready for bed

LUC
How long does she plan on staying

LEA
How should I know As long as she
needs A few weeks a few months Is
it a problem

LUC
To be honest yes Okay she’s your
sister but

LEA
But what

LUC
You heard Lili She wanted to know
LEA

So
LUC
Her being “away” won’t work for long
LEA
Itll work as long as it works we’ll
see
LUC

“Well see We’ll see” You make me
laugh What are you going to say to
her The truth

LEA
Luc don’t give me a hard time This
is our first evening I’ve just got my
sister back I don’t know if you
realize what that means I’ve just got
her back

LUC
You hardly know her Just because you
went to see her a couple of times for
a few hours in the last few months

doesn’t You were only a teenager
when she —
LEA
Be quiet
LUC
Okay I’ll be quiet Quiet as a mouse
(beat )

But think of us a little too

8 INT JULIETTE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Juliette stands by the window We can vaguely make out the garden
below

Juliette is still wearing Léa’s clothes Léa She goes over to the
bed Sits on the edge as if she plans to spend the whole night
like that

FADE TO BLACK

9 INT KITCHEN - DAY
It’s total happy bubbly chaos in the kitchen

The girls are finishing their breakfast Léa is a whirl of fevered
activity

Still in his pyjamas Papy Paul slurps coffee from a bowl smiling
as always

Juliette observes the scene leaning against the wall with a mug of
tea in one hand

LEA
Cmon kids Chop chop we’re gonna

LILI
Arent we always

LEA
Emelia what are you doing What are
you doing I don’t believe it

Emelia has smeared yoghurt all over her dress

LEA

Lili finish up quickly

Léa dashes out with Emelia in her arms
Papy Paul leaves also
Juliette and Little Lili are alone

Luc has just entered Little Lili throws her arms round him

LILI
Don’t you eat breakfast

JULIETTE
It depends

LILI
I’m never hungry in the morning Ever
since I was a little girl Mummy gets
so angry Did you ever see me when I
was little when Mummy and Daddy
brought me back from Vietnam

Little Lili and Léa walk toward the gates

LEA

Ask Madame Rouyer if she found your

pink beret

11 INT LEA’S CAR - DAY

Juliette is in the passenger seat

Léa’s face looms up at the window
Juliette stares straight ahead breathing heavily

Léa walks round and gets in behind the wheel
LEA
Are you okay
Juliette nods several times her breath rasping slightly

Sure

JULIETTE
Yes

Léa pulls out and drives in silence for a moment

Beat

Juliette shrugs

LEA
The police station is close to the
university I’m teaching for two
hours but we can meet up after if
you want There’s a nice café just
opposite the campus gates

JULIETTE
Okay

LEA
You know what they want to see you

For never coming to see you

LEA

LEA
One evening Dad saw me Mummy and him

gave me a real roasting They banned
me from writing They said you you

12 INT WAITING ROOM POLICE STATION - DAY

Juliette sits on a bench with an OLD LADY beside her
The old lady glances at Juliette Smiles Juliette smiles back

Beat
The old lady glances at her again

OLD LADY
Are you reporting a crime too

JULIETTE
No
Just then an INSPECTOR appears Plain clothes same age as
Juliette

INSPECTOR
Juliette Fontaine

JULIETTE
Yes

INSPECTOR
Follow me please

13 INT INSPECTOR’S OFFICE - DAY
Juliette sits opposite the Inspector

He flicks through a file pores over a couple of pages goes back a

few pages and re-reads frowning but not hostile or judgmental —
friendly almost

He closes the file

INSPECTOR

I see you’re a doctor

JULIETTE
Was I was struck off the medical
register

INSPECTOR

Makes no difference Once a doctor
always a doctor It’s like me I’1l
always be a cop

(suddenly )
You have a pretty name I don’t like
my name but Fontaine is very pretty
It brings to mind gurgling water
streams rivers The Orinoco You
know the Orinoco No

He uses his pen to point to a poster on the wall behind him which
shows a broad swathe of an unidentifiable river

INSPECTOR

There’1l be no more fountains soon
Municipalities are closing them down —
even in tiny villages They’re filled
with earth and made into flower beds
Stupid geraniums usually

(switches topic again)
I wont hassle you The law says we
have to see each other so we see each
other but I won’t give you any
bother Do you have a job

JULIETTE
Not yet

INSPECTOR
A place to stay

LEA
With my sister

INSPECTOR
That’s nice Family’s important
Youre lucky I live alone Divorced
Small apartment Small bed Anyway

He gets up goes to the door

INSPECTOR
See you in two weeks

JULIETTE
Goodbye

INSPECTOR
Goodbye
14 INTEXT UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY

there

LEA

(like it’s a real drama)
Why don’t I remember

The door opens
Little Lili and Juliette enter the bedroom followed by Emelia

schoolwork That’s what I made for
Mother’s Day but Katrina broke it
She says it wasn’t her but she’s a
liar Those are my books

Juliette runs her fingers along the spines of the books Lingers
over one she apparently remembers from her childhood called Model
Little Ladies

LILI

write poems in it Do you want me to
read you one

JULIETTE

JULIETTE
(snaps )
No I said no

Little Lili looks at her in amazement
Juliette scurries out of the room

17 INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Juliette is with a plump smiling young woman (the SOCIAL WORKER)
They each sit on a couch facing each other across a coffee table

SOCIAL WORKER
You’re lucky to have your sister her
family and a home

JULIETTE
So I’ve been told

SOCIAL WORKER
It’s true though Most people when
they get out don’t know where to go
Nobody wants them Their spouses
almost always file for divorce

JULIETTE
I got that out of the way before I
went in

SOCIAL WORKER
Yes it’s in your file Right well

Outside Léa parks her car and gets out She meets the Social
Worker by the gate
They nod

Léa enters

LEA
Was that the social worker

JULIETTE
Yes

LEA
She seems sweet enough

JULIETTE
People whose role is to rummage
through your life often seem sweet
enough

Léa glances curiously at her sister Puts her bag down Thinks
LEA
I guess you’re right We had that too
— Luc and me — when we adopted Visits
for this visits for that social
workers shrinks and even an idiot
doctor who had Luc walking up and down
in his underpants in his office with
his arms stretched out I thought Luc
was going to strangle him He really
resented all the questions and
prying Tea

18 INT KITCHEN - DAY
Léa is making tea Juliette stands close by

LEA
It took nearly two years for Little
Lili and a bit less for Emelia The
first time we spent three months in
Vietnam We fell in love with the
place and would have happily stayed
longer We had Little Lili with us
almost the whole time at the hotel
but the bureaucracy and all the
formalities took forever

KATRINA (0S)

tried to find her Emelia on the
other hand Well we got absolutely
no information She’1l never know

office

20 INT CAFE - DAY

Juliette is in a small bar near the window watching events
outside and in

At the bar a GUY who’s good-looking and knows it talks animatedly
with another guy and the waitress

Nothing of their conversation filters over except the occasional
burst of laughter

Juliette glances over a couple of times when they laugh
particularly loudly

Eventually the guy notices Juliette and watches her while
continuing his conversation with the others

After a while he comes over Without asking he takes a seat at
Juliette’s table
GUY
You want my photo
Juliette doesn’t answer

GUY
Have we met

JULIETTE
I don’t think so

GUY
Why were you staring at me then What
do you want

JULIETTE
Nothing I wasn’t staring at you

GUY
Bullshit You keep eying me up You
looking for a man

Juliette smiles amused by his question
Then she eyes him up and down
21 INT HOTEL ROOM - DAY
Juliette lies pensively in bed the sheets pulled up to her chin
The guy comes out of the bathroom and finishes dressing
GUY
Was it good
Juliette gazes at him before answering

No Not at all But it’s okay

The guy looks furious
He mumbles something grabs his jacket and storms out

The camera holds on Juliette who hasn’t moved an inch

22 EXT PARK - DAY

Léa and Juliette walk side by side chatting
The two little girls run ahead

Wide shot
Then the CAMERA is right behind them
The children are already standing at some animal cages

LILI

LILI
What did I do

LEA
Nothing get your sister We’ll go and
buy you some waffles

The two girls race ahead once more

JULIETTE
Don’t be silly

Léa doesn’t answer
They walk along in silence

JULIETTE
Do you think you can erase fifteen
years of your life like that Just by
not talking about it Do you think I
was asleep the whole time like in
some kind of fairy tale Then one
morning the good fairy Léa came to
wake me up

23 INT LEA and LUC’S BEDROOM - NIGHT
Léa is in bed reading a book
Léa sits on the edge of the bed listening to the soccer results
a transistor radio

RADIO ANNOUNCER (0C)
Auxerre beat Sochaux 3-2 Lens and
Lille drew 2-2 in the big northern
derby Monaco lost to Bordeaux 2-1
Saint-Etienne defeated Marseille 3-0
PSG lost to Nancy at home by 3 goals

LUC
Yes PSG lost Ha ha They can stick
it up their asses

LUC
Very funny Jeez 3-1

LEA
(wide-eyed)
What the hell is wrong with you

LUC
Well what do you talk about then

LEA
Sister things

LUC
You’re shitting me

LEA
What do you expect me to say It all
takes time It’s not easy My parents
banished any thought of my sister from
my head Now I’ve got her back It’s
like a re-birth What happened before
is Oh just let me sleep

She puts her book down turns off her light and rolls over

24 INT DINING ROOM - EVENING
Desserts has been served

Around the table are Léa Luc Papy Paul Michel Juliette and
another couple — Samir and his younger pregnant wife Kaisha

Through the partition doors we see Little Lili and Emelia asleep
on the couches fully dressed

At table the atmosphere is upbeat with all the guests laughing and
joking happily

Sitting next to Michel Juliette seems quite relaxed too but
still a little reserved

Just like Luc who occasionally glances apprehensively at her

The conversation opens 0S the time it takes for the camera to
track past the two kids into the dining room

MICHEL (0S)
And you know your father backs me 100
on this one Don’t you Papy Paul

loyal supporter Nancy have ever had
Aren’t you Dad

He reaches for the salad bowl

Léa nods

LEA

but I’m not promising anything

MICHEL
Katrina

SAMIR
Michel it’s outrageous that you’ve
lived in Lorraine for years and you
still support a team that’s mostly
made up of Brazilians

MICHEL
Mostly Only two Brazilians play for
PSG You don’t know what you’re
talking about Anyway you’ll bore
Juliette

JULIETTE
Unlikely I love football I played a
lot when I was a teenager

LEA

intelligent and loves football

JULIETTE
Except for the supporters

SAMIR
Take that

MICHEL

surgeon paid by al-Qaida to run amok
in French hospitals beat me in an
argument about football

LUC
Can you play on Sunday

KAISHA
Forget it He was saying earlier that
he has a zillion exams to mark

SAMIR

That’s the third week running youve
bailed on us

MICHEL
Yeah it’s been three weeks that two
hundred papers have been sitting on my
desk waiting for me to mark them

JULIETTE
You play football together

The camera closes in on Michel and Juliette
OS the buzz of the others’ conversation

MICHEL
We try Some days there’s only ten of
us and some days forty people turn up
to play which gets a bit crazy You
should come watch us one day

long time

JULIETTE
Where I was until recently I always
kept a few books near my pillow I
sensed their presence at night when I
turned over It reassured me

much as a means of escape but like a
dream

During the week I eat canned food

stew Those are my favourites I eat
in front of the TV onSometimes I
don’t even heat them up I can’t cook
to save my life and I can’t be
bothered to learn I have some green
vegetables at the weekend Doctor’s
orders Do you agree with him

JULIETTE
Definitely You can’t just eat tinned
food

INSPECTOR
I guess What about eggs

JULIETTE
They’re okay but not every day

INSPECTOR
No I usually boil or fry one up ona
Sunday and eat it in front of the TV
Do you watch TV

JULIETTE
No

INSPECTOR
Not even when you were in prison

JULIETTE
No

INSPECTOR

I see I thought everybody in prison
watched TV I force myself It’s a
kind of punishment There’s something
totally ugly about it Like a pile of
rubbish that’s delivered to your door
Every evening I feel like the heap’s
bigger and uglier than the day before
And it smacks me in the face

(beat )
How about you Everything okay

computer would have made a mistake

BAMAKALE
It made two last year alone Miss And
every time I’m the aggrieved party

LEA

notes every other day

LEA
March 4 1999 When we found out he
had no chance of pulling through I
wanted to tell you I had a huge fight
with Mummy and she went and told him
He made me promise never to contact
you He was crying His voice came out
in a feeble rasp He was hooked up to
dozens of tubes He weighed barely
more than fifty kilos I cried too
And I promised him I’m sorry

LEA
Did you ever think of us when you
were down there

JULIETTE
Down there That makes it sound so
pretty and nice “Down there” was a
prison

She shows anger for the first time

Awkward silence

JULIETTE
Do you know what a prison is Hours
and days in prison Years in prison
The outside world leaving you behind
Life leaving you behind Everything
leaving you behind

JULIETTE

(calmer )

Is she still living at Beaufans
LEA

Mummy No I had to find a home for
her She lived with us at first then
two years after Dad died she began to
lose her memory Now she doesn’t
recognize anyone When I go to see
her she thinks I’m a nurse or a
neighbour or something

JULIETTE
They never spoke about me

Léa shakes her head

JULIETTE
What did they tell other people

LEA
Anybody who knew the family knew
better than to mention it Anybody

daughter

They thought that or they were told
that

They were told that

their faces

She reaches out her hand and brushes her fingers over a small scar
on Juliette’s thigh

psychologists Their report runs to

LUC
No way Japanese films always put me

Men in dark suits and top hats stand in the background

MICHEL (0S)
It’s called Grief

Juliette is startled

JULIETTE
You startled me

MICHEL

JULIETTE
Who painted it

MICHEL
Emile Friant Famous when he was
alive totally forgotten since his
death in the 1930s I’11 show you
another of his that is my favourite
Come on

They walk into the next room

Michel stops at a small painting showing a young woman’s face
against a snowy landscape

MICHEL
The first time I saw it it blew me
away She looks exactly like a girl I
was in love with in my early 20s I
was crazy about her She didn’t even
see me though This is my revenge
She’s imprisoned in a frame and I can
look at her whenever I want She can’t
say a thing

39 EXT SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY
Juliette and Michel are having lunch

MICHEL
Léa is amazing She’s one of the best
specialists in France in her field
But she doesn’t have the killer
instinct In our work you have to
trample over people to get ahead

JULIETTE
Do you have that killer instinct

MICHEL
Do I look like I do

JULIETTE
I don’t know you well enough

MICHEL
No I’m not into that anymore

They laugh

JULIETTE
You were What changed

smoke and the buzz of conversations

The Inspector notices she has wet hair

INSPECTOR
Is it raining

JULIETTE
No I’ve been swimming

INSPECTOR
You swim Me too but not in swimming
pools I told you about the Orinoco
didn’t I

JULIETTE
Yes the first time we met

INSPECTOR
It’s a huge huge river Over 1500
miles long It never ends And it’s
powerful Rapids waterfalls flood
plains

JULIETTE
You’ve seen it for real

INSPECTOR
Not yet It’s a project of mine We’ll
see It’s not easy I have a young
daughter She lives with her mother
and I don’t see her often Her mother
moved away And my daughter has moved
away from me too
You know the Orinoco is a real
mystery Several expeditions have set
out to find its source and none of
them has ever really succeeded They
found little streams but not the real
source It’s fascinating isn’t it
We know everything nowadays but we
can’t find the source of a river
(beat )
I signed and approved the papers

LUC
She wants you to read her a story
43 INT LITTLE LILI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Juliette sits on the bed reading
Little Lili is fast asleep

JULIETTE
“The old man smiled and for a Moment
it seemed to Baji that his host was a
boy of his own age or a young girl
or an infant In the sky the silver
stars twinkled and the moon rose as
full as a woman’s tummy”

Juliette realizes that Little Lili is asleep
She quietly closes the book

And gazes at the child Impassively Eerily

Eventually she leans forward and kisses Little Lili with real
emotion for the first time

In the doorway Léa watches
Juliette turns round and sees her
Léa smiles at her sister

47 EXTINT FARMHOUSE - DAY
MONTAGE

The car pulls up outside a rundown farmhouse
The duck pond

Adults and children playing
More friends arrive In all there are over fifteen adults
including Michel and Samir and his wife

Children bouncing around in the bedrooms
Women busy in the kitchen

Men opening bottles of wine Playing soccer
The table set for dinner

MONTAGE ends
48 INT FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

An open fire blazes in the hearth
Children are fast asleep curled up on the floor or in chairs
In one corner the older children play a game

Around the table the adults have flushed faces
Empty bottles litter the table

A joint goes round

Everybody’s laughing and joking

One guy (GERARD) looks particularly drunk

LEA
I don’t have to like Rohmer It’s a
free country

GERARD
I don’t see how you can teach
literature and not understand Rohmer’s
movies

SAMIR
Léa didn’t say she doesn’t underst and
them She said she doesn’t like them
There’s a subtle difference

GERARD
I can’t believe what I’m hearing I
can’t help wondering how you explain
Racine to your students

LEA
That’s irrelevant What’s Racine got
to do with anything

GERARD
Rohmer is the Racine of the 20”
century but if you guys are too
stupid to see it

WOMAN 1
That’s totally unfair

MICHEL
(hands Gerard the joint)
Here have some of this and chill out
Next you’ll be telling us that
Stallone is Shakespeare

GERARD
Screw you You don’t care about
anything except soccer What about
you Juliette What do you think

Her face cupped in her hands Juliette smiles and shrugs
GERARD
Juliette doesn’t think anything
Juliette watches and judges But who
is Juliette A woman of mystery A
sprite a goblin Having been hidden
from us all this time Juliette —

LUC
Cut it out You’re a pain in the ass
Go get some fresh air

Gerard raps his knife against his glass

GERARD
Ladies and gentlemen pray silence I
would humbly like to suggest we play a
little game The winner will receive
my deepest consideration

MAN 1
You can shove your consideration

GERARD
And a kiss from Juliette

LEA
Gerard you can be such an asshole

GERARD
The game is to find the reason why Léa
hid her delightful sister from us for
the last two hundred years Where was
Juliette What was Juliette doing

SAMIR
Knock it off

GERARD
Was Juliette on the other side of the
world Was she not speaking to Léa
Was Juliette

MICHEL
Cut it out Gerard

GERARD
-hidden somewhere in Switzerland In
a convent Was Juliette

LUC
Youre getting on everybody’s nerves

GERARD
a lion tamer in a circus a Mossad
spy an amnesic Answer us Juliette
Answer us

LEA
Shut the fuck up Gerard

LUC
Be quiet or Ill belt you

GERARD
Let Juliette speak For once I have
heroine from a novel in front of me
want to hear her tell me

MICHEL
That you’re an asshole

GERARD
The truth Juliette disappears
Juliette reappears Juliette
Juliette

MAN 1

GERARD
Not before I know where Juliette has
been The beautiful Juliette

He gazes at her
Gradually everybody else falls silent

Everybody else joins in except Léa Luc and Michel

Juliette stands by the lake It’s a very dark night
OS laughter filters from the farmhouse

Then footsteps

Michel draws level with Juliette Puts a hand on her shoulder

She shrugs it off

MICHEL
Sorry about him He’s an ass when he’s
drunk but he’s a good guy

Beat

MICHEL

They all think you were joking I

(pause)
I’m sure you werent Before I got my
job at the university I taught in
prisons for ten years I rarely talk
about it I used to go in three
times a week And I’d come out three
times a week That changed my whole
life my whole way of looking at
things people the sky passing time
coming and going being in the street
everything I stopped being so certain
of things making judgments the way
people always do Everybody I met
behind bars it seemed like they were
just like me They could have been me
and I could have been them It’s a
fine line sometimes

50 EXT OUTSIDE LEA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Michel parks outside the house

Juliette is in the passenger seat

MICHEL
Will you be okay

Yes Thanks for the ride

They gaze at each other
Michel reaches out to caress her cheek

JULIETTE
Don’t Please I’m still a long
way away
She gets out of the car
51 INT FACULTY BUILDINGS - DAY

Léa leads a discussion with a dozen students
She’s tense irritable

The STUDENT she is debating with is very calm and measured
As their argument develops the other students glance at each other
with raised eyebrows

LEA
That’s only true of Raskolnikov You
can’t extend the notion of redemptive
guilt to humanity in general and
suggest that each murder contains its
own redemption

STUDENT
Yet the aim of the novelist is to
reconstitute the world Dostoyevsky is
no exception

LEA
In the case of this novel you know
full well that the narration is
impersonal and moreover incomplete
as if the author refused to put
forward a single worldview because he
knows that there are numerous
interpretations and motivations And
numerous shades of truth

STUDENT
But the first draft is in the first
person One can deduce therefore
that the initial project was indeed to
portray a single soul that might give
the reader an intimate yet universal
insight into murder and murderers

Léa is really wound up
Her students are shocked

LEA
You don’t know what you’re talking
about What do you know about murder
and murderers

STUDENT
I

LEA
And what did Dostoyevsky know about it
deep down Well Nothing Nada Zilch
Even masterpieces are no more than
hypotheses simplistic extrapolations
that are nothing compared to true
life Nothing Got that If you
stopped thinking a book is the last
word on something you wouldn’t spout
so much bullshit

Stunned silence
Léa pulls herself together

LEA
I I am terribly sorry I apologize
I don’t know what

She grabs her notes and hurries out

52 INT FACULTY BUILDING - DAY
Léa rushes down a hallway

When she reaches her office she finds Bamakalé sitting on a bench

outside
He is impeccably dressed as always

As soon as he sees her he jumps to his feet
BAMAKALE
Good morning I wondered if I —
LEA
Not now This is not the time
She rushes into her office and slams the door
Bamakalé stares at it in dismay

53 INT LEA’S OFFICE - DAY
Holding her head in her hands Léa sobs

54 INT TYPING POOL HOSPITAL - DAY

Juliette follows the woman who interviewed her for the job earlier

She introduces Juliette to a couple of other secretaries typing

away at their computers
They come to an empty desk

WOMAN
This is your desk Your job is
essentially to type up medical reports
and perhaps help out your colleagues
from time to time The trial period is
three weeks At the end of that
period the director will inform you
of his decision I’1l let you get
settled in

She walks away stops and backtracks

WOMAN
I rely on you to be discreet of
course
55 INT LEA’S HOUSE - DAY

Léa arrives home Dumps grocery bags in the hall Listens

OS on the piano the tune Juliette taught Little Lili in an

earlier scene
It clearly perturbs Léa

She hurries upstairs to the spare room where Little Lili is playing
with Juliette next to her

Emelia sits on the floor Papy Paul is in one corner smiling
Little Lili stops and runs over to hug her mother

LILI
Mummy Come and play Play Mummy
Auntie said you used to be very good
Léa hesitates

Juliette shuffles over on the piano stool and nods to her to sit
down

Léa still hesitates Then goes over and sits at the piano
Each movement seems deeply thought-out

She gazes at the piano like a long-lost friend
Then her sister

They begin playing together
Juliette starts to sing

JULIETTE
A la claire fontaine m’en allant
promener
Jai trouvé l’eau si claire
Que je m’y suis baignée
(At the fountain as I was walking by
The water was so clear
That I want for a swim)

Léa joins in

JULIETTE and LEA
Il y a longtemps que je t’aime
jamais je ne t’oublierai
(I’ve loved you so long
I can never forget you)

Jai trouvé l’eau si claire
Que je m’y suis baignée
A la feuille d’un chéne
Je me suis essuyée
(The water was so clear
That I want for a swim
I found an oak leaf
to use to dry myself)

Il y a longtemps que je t’aime
jamais je ne t’oublierai

(I’ve loved you so long
I can never forget you)

Lalala lalala lalalalalala
Lalala lalalala

Léa and Juliette glance at each other deeply moved
Juliette runs her hand down Léa’s arm

One of them lobs a tape onto Juliette’s desk

DOCTOR

Cardiology

Juliette removes her headset

JULIETTE
Sorry

DOCTOR

(irritably)

to Cardio

JULIETTE

well

DOCTOR

Who the hell do you think you are
You’re just a secretary Do what I
say I want that over there in fifteen

They’re hiring them older than before
and more stupid than ever

57 INT CAFE - DAY
The Inspector and Juliette sit at a table

INSPECTOR

At my age it’s not easy meeting
someone new I don’t like going out
And being a cop scares people off But
I could be at Social Services itd be
the same I sit at a desk all day and
process paperwork I’d be no use
trying to catch a thief

(beat )
This is where I met my wife They’ve
redecorated but it’s basically still
the same Where did you meet your
husband

JULIETTE
At college

INSPECTOR
He was a doctor too

JULIETTE
No he dropped out after two years He
got a job supervising a team of health
visitors

INSPECTOR
When did you last see him

JULIETTE
At the trial He testified against me

INSPECTOR
Like my wife Ever since she’s
never She sends my daughter here by

plane or train with a label round her
neck like a parcel
(beat )
I could still describe exactly how she
was dressed the first time we met
(beat )
How’s work

JULIETTE
Fine

INSPECTOR
Nobody giving you any trouble

JULIETTE
No

INSPECTOR
By the way I think I’11l soon be
You remember my Orinoco project
After all this time it’s much clearer
in my mind now Deep down there’s

nothing and nobody to make it worth me
staying here

58 INT KITCHEN - EVENING

All her doctor’s reflexes come flooding back

JULIETTE

Papy Paul peeks in

LEA

LEA

That was the first thing I did every

have your individual tasks to do
there has to be unity team spirit
We’re not machines Several of your
co-workers say you are cold and
distant You never talk to anyone

disappointing

JULIETTE
Does that mean I’m out of a job

DIRECTOR
Of course not I didn’t say that did

LILI
But Auntie Juliette was much older
than you
Léa nods
LILI

So she protected you

LEA
Against absolutely everything

LILI
So why did she stop one day

LEA
What do you mean

LILI
Why’d she go away for so long and
leave you all alone

LEA
Because I wasn’t a little girl
anymore Sleep now

She kisses Little Lili and turns to leave

though Even when we’re grown up

65 EXT STREETS - NIGHT
Juliette and Michel come out of a cinema

MICHEL
Do you want to go for a drink

JULIETTE
It’s a warm night Let’s walk

They walk along in silence apparently happy together here now

JULIETTE
For two years the only walking I got
to do was in a tiny triangular
courtyard with big high walls
I counted my steps every step I took
And kept on counting later when I was
at Centrale The guards called me The
Walker But the other inmates called
me Nobody

Michel looks quizzically

JULIETTE
Short for Nobody’s Home

MICHEL
There’s a Giono novel — I’m pretty
sure it’s his last — that has a great
female character who’s withdrawn into
silence She calls herself Nobody The
main character falls madly in love
with her

JULIETTE
Do you see the world through books
youve read

MICHEL
Books have been a big help to me
Sometimes they are better friends
than people don’t you find
He glances at her as they walk along
Eventually she turns to look at him too

66 INT KITCHEN - DAY

JULIETTE
May I

Papy Paul smiles at her
Juliette sits opposite him and smiles back
Clearly she finds his presence soothing
Papy Paul goes back to his book
Juliette sits saying nothing
From time to time he looks up and smiles at her

OS a key in the front door
Juliette gets up and says goodnight

In the hall Léa is home
The two sisters talk in whispers

69 INT RETIREMENT HOME - DAY

Juliette and Léa walk down a hallway past old folks in blue
towelling robes
Léa carries a bouquet of flowers

They reach a door Léa knocks and enters

In the room their MOTHER spins round when she hears the door

LEA
Hi Mummy

MOTHER

MOTHER

(re Juliette)
Is she with you
LEA
Mum

MOTHER
Stop calling me that It’s very
annoying Don’t just stand there

stolen here

Léa glances at Juliette then leaves the room
Their mother sits in a chair

MOTHER
It’s a funny job you do Pestering
people all day Can’t you take your
junk somewhere else

She leans forward takes her head in both hands and shakes it
Stops Looks up and stares straight at Juliette

Her face is unrecognizable Her lips quiver

MOTHER
(gently in English)
My darling Juliette Are you back
from school already Come and give me
a big kiss Come and kiss your Mummy

Juliette freezes

MOTHER
Come on sweety What’s wrong Come
on I am so happy to see you I am
so happy

The old lady holds her hand out
Juliette eventually takes hold of it

Her mother pulls her towards her
Juliette is caught between astonishment the urge to run and
emotion

MOTHER
I’m all alone here you know They
locked me up I’m all all alone Take
me home with you Take me home
please

She sobs
Juliette strokes her hair and forehead

Just then Léa returns
She stops in her tracks

Eventually her mother looks up
She is transformed again

MOTHER

(in French)
That’s quite enough

(notices Juliette standing beside her)
What are you doing pressing up
against me You’ve got a nerve Get
out of here now both of you Go on
Out

MONTAGE ends

JULIETTE
Michel Hi it’s Juliette

MICHEL (0S)

Goodbye Juliette
She hangs up her disappointment accentuated by the fact that
Michel was clearly not telling her something
71 INT BAR - EVENING
A fairly cramped space Juliette stands at the bar a glass of r
wine in front of her Sips at it

Lined up at the bar other customers sip their beer or Ricard in
much the same way lost in their drink or their thoughts

Nobody talks Nobody pays any attention to anyone else
In the background the radio plays
The Bar Owner does his accounts

A banal but odd glimpse of daily human existence

72 EXTINT LEA’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Juliette pushes the gate open and walks up to the house
Inside the house silence
No lights are on

JULIETTE
Hello Anyone home

She knocks on Papy Paul’s door No answer

Michel leap up and start singing

ALL
(except Papy Paul)
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday
to you Happy birthday dear Juliette
Happy birthday to you

They cheer and applaud
The two girls carry over a huge gift-wrapped present

Juliette tries to say something but the words catch in her throat
Her eyes fill with tears

She laughs

73 INT MICHEL’S APARTMENT - DAY

Michel is stretched out on the couch
Juliette sits on the floor her head resting on Michel’s thigh

JULIETTE
The worst thing maybe was the end
the last few weeks before it was over
and after they told me I was being
released I started having nightmares
Always the same one in fact I had my
case packed I stepped outside and
found myself in the middle of nowhere
There was nothing and nobody there
Just emptiness
One day they told me I had a visitor
I thought it was a mistake It was the
first time ever There was a young
woman waiting to see me She smiled
It was Léa
I listened to her without saying a
word She promised she’d come again
That night I promised myself Id
refuse to see her She belonged to a
part of my life that had died Then
just before I went to sleep I thought
back to when she was little Lala we
used to call her The gaps in her
teeth her smile her fringe that
would never stay in the same place
And her hand in mine It was that
little girl that made me decide to
come back

74 INT LOCKER ROOM SWIMMING POOL - DAY

Léa and Juliette stand side by side drying their hair in the
mirror

LEA
Luc wants to take a trip to the
mountains “Top up the red blood
cells” as he puts it Being fit for
his stupid soccer games is all that
matters to him

Léa pauses and gazes at Juliette’s face in the mirror
They stare at each other’s reflection as if seeking the answer to a
much deeper mystery

LEA

When I was little I so wanted to be
like you

JULIETTE
And now
Beat
They go back to drying their hair
LEA
You know what I thought about last
night The Green House at Hossegor

When was the last time we were there
The year I broke my wrist

JULIETTE
I went back once more after that

Léa glances quizzically at her sister but a bunch of women
noisily by 0S stop her pressing the issue

The women’s voices and laughter eventually fade
LEA
I thought it had been knocked down
JULIETTE

Fifteen years ago it was still
standing

Léa is intrigued now

JULIETTE
I took Pierre there

Léa gazes at Juliette’s reflection but doesn’t dare ask

75 INT LEA’S HOUSE - EVENING

She picks up two pairs of earrings

JULIETTE
These ones or these ones

exhausted already

She gives them each a kiss
Luc whispers in her ear

LUC
Don’t come home too late will you

LEA
You can bank on it sweety
She gives him one last kiss and a sly wink

76 INT NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Juliette and Léa are caught in the throng in the club entrance

Chatter Laughter Throbbing music

Léa can’t stop grinning as they shuffle towards the dance floor
Behind her as the music gets louder Juliette looks increasingly
uncomfortable

Léa doesn’t notice a thing The camera closes in on her

After a few seconds she glances round
Juliette has disappeared

77 EXT PARKING LOT NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Léa rushes out of the club calling out Juliette’s name
Finally she hears sobbing coming from around a corner

Juliette is squatting on the ground crying her eyes out
Léa hunkers down and takes her in her arms

Juliette clings to Léa like a life buoy

78 INT CAR - NIGHT

Léa drives
Juliette sits in a ball in the passenger seat Haggard tear -
streaked cheeks

Léa eventually breaks the silence

Juliette glances at her sister
LEA

Two people sit nearby
A YOUNG INSPECTOR arrives

YOUNG INSPECTOR
(reads from a card)
Juliette Fontaine

JULIETTE
Yes

YOUNG INSPECTOR
Follow me

She follows him down the hallway
He doesn’t say a word

He shows her into the same office as before

But it doesn’t look the same

The Orinoco poster has been replaced by an official National Police
Force poster

The young Inspector sits at the desk and opens a file
Juliette hesitates and decides to stay standing
He talks without taking his eyes off the file

YOUNG INSPECTOR
My name is Segral I’m your new
probation officer replacing Inspector
Fauré

JULIETTE
(brightly)
So he finally did it He went to see
the Orinoco

The Inspector tears his eyes from the file and stares at Juliette
as if she’s totally nuts

YOUNG INSPECTOR
If going to see the Orinoco means
blowing your brains out yes he
finally did it Ten days ago

Juliette gasps and grabs the back of the chair in front of her

80 EXT OUTSIDE LEA’S HOUSE - DAY
Juliette walks home

Outside the house Léa is about to get into the car

On a table in the garden Léa Juliette and the two girls are

Juliette and Léa glance at each other and smile

LEA

JULIETTE

contract

LUC

drink
MICHEL (0S)
My impeccable sense of timing

Afghanis

Everybody looks past him to see Samir Kaisha and their new baby
arriving
More cheers

84 INT KITCHEN - DAY
An apron tied round her waist Juliette puts the last fritter on
the serving dish that Little Lili is ready to take out
OS laughter and banter from the garden

JULIETTE
Careful you don’t burn yourself And

Little Lili walks out as if the platter were a royal crown
Juliette watches her affectionately Wipes her hands

Léa arrives
The sisters glance at each other with love and great affection

Juliette opens her mouth to speak but bites her tongue
LEA
What

Juliette smiles and shakes her head
She gazes at Léa once more

JULIETTE
Thank you
85 INT FINE ARTS MUSEUM - DAY

Juliette wanders round the museum tightly framed by the camera
We see her face in close-up with a blur of paintings behind her
she looks round

as

She stops at a painting of the Annunciation

The camera closes in on the face of the Angel Gabriel telling Mary
the good news

Juliette seems to be in key with the painting

MICHEL (0S)
Here look at this one

We pull back to see that Michel has been walking along with
Juliette all this time his arm round her waist

He points to another painting
Juliette looks then averts her eyes rapidly
Michel doesn’t notice

The camera pulls back still further until we lose them in the
vastness of the museum

An ordinary couple Just like any other

86 INT JULIETTE’S BEDROOM - DAY

Juliette puts away her freshly laundered clothes in the cupboard
The photo and sheet of paper are tucked between two sweaters
Juliette takes them out and kisses them

LUC (0S)
(from downstairs)
Juliette It’s 830 already If you
want me to give you a lift it’s right
now

JULIETTE
Coming
She is about to tuck the photo out of sight again but thinks
twice

She gazes at the cupboard frowns then turns round and gently puts
the photo and sheet of paper down on the bed in full view

At the door Juliette glances round at the bed and heaves a sigh of
relief as if a huge weight has been lifted from her shoulders

87 INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
Léa has pushed back the furniture to clean

LEA

Papy Paul Sure I believe you
(louder )
When youve finished in the kitchen

She has something in her hand that we can’t make out
LEA

taken you to créche

EMELIA
Mummy Mummy
She holds out her hand
LEA
What have you got there

Léa immediately recognizes Pierre Juliette’s son
Emelia gurgles some more
Léa snaps out of her trance
LEA

people’s things It’s wrong I forbid

Emelia bursts into tears

88 INT JULIETTE’S BEDROOM - DAY
Léa enters her sister’s bedroom and sees the cupboard door is open
A sheet of paper lies on the bed
A child’s handwriting and hearts drawn on the page draw her eye
Léa picks up the paper
OS Emelia is still crying and calling for her “Mummy Mummy”

Léa holds the photo in one hand and the sheet of paper in the

other
The camera scans the handwriting as she reads

A garden in the rain

Is peaceful and sad too
Mummy I feel the same
When I’m far from you

Your smile lights up the sky
And makes me so happy

If one day you must die

Make sure it’s after me

Your loving son Pierre

Léa stares at the page deeply moved
She flips it over and her emotion gives way to surprise

The camera just gives us time to make out lines of figures and
columns that look like the results of a number of tests

Léa is intrigued

She isn’t sure what to do
Then she leaves the room and goes to her study where she scans
the document

389 INT CAFE - DAY

From the outside looking in we see Juliette sitting in the café
She looks out Watches people passing by
She seems at peace with herself

90 INT SPARE ROOM - NIGHT

JULIETTE

Léa stops what she’s doing and gazes at her sister
OS Little Lili keeps playing

91 INT DOCTOR’S OFFICE - DAY

In a white coat stethoscope round his neck Samir sits reading the
scanned document
Léa sits anxiously opposite him

Beat

Samir looks up and frowns

SAMIR
Why did you tear the name off the top
of the page

No answer

SAMIR
It’s Lili isn’t it

LEA
(taken aback)
No not at all

SAMIR
Do you swear

LEA
I swear it isn’t Little Lili Samir
Honestly You don’t know the little
It’s somebody who died A long time
ago

SAMIR
So why all the mystery

LEA
I can’t explain now Please no
questions This is just very important
for me Very very important
Please

Samir glances over the document again

Léa observes him closely then looks away Sees a framed photo on
the desk

It shows Samir when he was younger with a young woman and two
children aged about four and six

They are all smiling

SAMIR
Ill have to consult a colleague whose
field this is I don’t want to mislead
you All I can say for the moment is
that it doesn’t look very good Not
good at all I’1ll call you as soon as
I have more

Léa smiles gratefully and gets up to go
Samir comes round to get the door for her

Suddenly Léa gives him a big hug She glances at the photo on the
desk again

Samir seems surprised by this show of affection Then he notices
what she’s looking at

SAMIR
(puts his hand over his heart)
They’re still here you know In the
end war is pretty weak It can’t
destroy everything

92 EXT STREET - DAY

Juliette waits outside an apartment building
Léa runs to meet her
They kiss on the cheeks
LEA
Sorry

JULIETTE
The woman from the agency gave me the
keys She’1l meet us there

93 INT EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY

Juliette and Léa look round a charming old apartment
From separate rooms they talk without being able to see each
other

JULIETTE
Well

LEA
What

JULIETTE

What do you think

LEA
(distractedly)
It’s not bad

JULIETTE
You don’t sound convinced

LEA
No it is It gets plenty of light

Juliette joins Léa in the next room
Beat

LEA
I liked having you at home with us

JULIETTE
Youve been acting strange for the
last couple of days What’s wrong

They look straight at each other
Léa is about to say something when the front door opens

ESTATE AGENT (0S)
Madame Fontaine

JULIETTE
Yes

94 INT LEA’S OFFICE FACULTY BLDG - DAY

Léa sits at her desk facing Bamakalé elegantly dressed as always
Léa seems weary and bored by his story

BAMAKALE
You have to understand I feel like I
have been passed from pillar to post
for the last few months I have been
the victim of a terrible mistake I
can’t sleep I don’t know where to
turn

The phone rings
Léa picks up and motions to Bamakalé to give her a minute

LEA
Yes Charly Right put him
through Thanks
(beat )
Samir No it’s fine Go ahead

Léa listens brow furrowed

Gradually her expression changes as if she has made an astonishing
realization

When Samir has finished she simply thanks him and hangs up

She seems to have completely forgotten about Bamakalé

Eventually he breaks the silence

BAMAKALE
As I was saying I have been treated
very unfairly This isn’t the first
time the people of Africa have
suffered an injustice You are well
aware

Léa looks up as if only just noticing his presence

BAMAKALE
- that my people have been oppressed
for centuries —

LEA
Mr Bamakalé you really are beginning
to piss me off with your complaints
about your marks You know that
You’re pissing me off

FADE TO BLACK

Juliette’s voice fades in while the screen is still black

JULIETTE (0S)

I knew as soon as the first symptoms
appeared I hardly even read the
results of the tests Pierrot grabbed
the letter and started writing a poem
on it When he gave it back he was
beaming with pride My little boy

(beat )
I saw him looking at me so happy so
beautiful He was my Pierrot Then I
pictured the little corpse he was
going to become

95 INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
FADE UP

Juliette stands by the window looking out at the garden

A few paces behind her Léa gazes at her sister

(As the scene develops Léa will get closer to Juliette until she
is pressed up against her sister

We sense they have cried a lot already They are beyond tears
Their eyes are puffy and red-rimmed

They are reaching the conclusion of a long painful discussion)

JULIETTE
I could picture him at every stage of
the disease I knew exactly how it
would develop The worst thing was
that I knew he wouldn’t just fall
asleep and never wake up like ina
kiddies’ story Soon he wouldn’t be

able to move He would suffer and
gradually the life would be squeezed
out of him And there was no cure
Nothing to relieve his suffering

(beat )
I went away with him People said I
abducted him I suppose I did I ran
away with him I fled with him and I
fed him and I showed him all the
places I loved best Saint-
Hippolyte Beaulian the Palioure
coast I had to increase the dose of
painkillers almost every day He was
so brave He used to say to me “I’m
your little husband”

(beat )
One evening we had a little party
just the two of us It was in the
Green House We sang we laughed and I
read him all his favourite stories
Then I put him to bed I told him I
loved him that he was running a fever
and I had to give him a jab He gave
me a hug and held me as tight as his
little arms could He recited his poem
and I held him in my arms until
morning

(beat )
Afterwards nothing seemed important
anymore

LEA
Why didn’t you say

JULIETTE

I felt so alone So alone Anyway
there was nothing to say Trying to
explain it would be trying to excuse
it Death has no excuses One way or
another I was guilty I had brought a
child into the world only to sentence
him to death

(beat )
You know the most horrible prison
The worst prison is the death of your
child There is never any release from
that prison

Léa holds Juliette in her arms
Juliette clings to her sister

Léa gives her a kiss

LEA
Look

Outside in the garden the sun comes out even though it’s still
raining
LEA

OS the front door opens
