and tosses it out the back

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD - The fire clears to reveal a
30 FOOT DROP The guys scream as they PLUNGE OVER IT

WHOOMP The Truck buries itself nose first in the sand
EXT AFGHAN DESERT -- DAY

Silence Smoke rises from a crater that was once the

sets down Walking up to the chopper

CLAY
Lieutenant youre to evac these
civvies to the Firebase immediately-

BLACKHAWK PILOT

perfectly well what Clay saved him from in that basement
OMAR

Clay nods A beat The Pilot pulls the stick back and
the CHOPPER ASCENDS The kids wave goodbye to our guys

Omar holding Clays gaze as they rise Only broken as
the chopper begins to recede into the distance The last
Clay sees of him is that ratty little TEDDY BEAR

POOCH

CLAY
All we did was say the word Max
and they blew up a building CIA

EXT HOLLYWOOD FL STREETS -- NIGHT
Clay and Aisha walk away from the BURNING MOTEL

CLAY
Howd you find me

AISHA

A FIRE ENGINE screams past them towards the burning hotel
as if to illustrate her point

CLAY
Howd you know I was alive

AISHA

in the safehouse debris in Karachi
Not nearly enough for five men

CLAY
Who else knows
AISHA
That youre alive Just me

CLAY
So whats to stop me from putting
a bullet in your head

AISHA
You want Max and I can tell you
how to get him

CLAY

I mean Jesus Wade the man was
scientific genius Granted his
weight signaled that he had certain
impulse control issues but thats
no reason to throw his fat ass out

Stop yelling at the sniper
THROUGH THE SCOPE -- Cougar sights the TAIL ROTOR of the
chopper on the left Smiles PRESSES THE TRIGGER

And we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters

The bullet strikes the tail rotor DEAD CENTER -- it SHORTS
and spins off -- sending the chopper itself into a spin --
COLLIDING with its TWIN CHOPPER on the right -- they

both twist and hink up -- their ROTORS SLICING INTO EACH
OTHER -- both FINALLY CAREENING ONTO THE FREEWAY BEHIND

Cobra Helicopters splattered across the road

A nice quiet neighborhood Outside the kitchen window
Poochs wife JOLENE doing dishes in the sink again

A RUSTLING Jolene looks up this time She obviously
heard it She puts down the dishes and goes to the door
Opens it and looks out to see

Nothing Not even by the swingset

She sighs About to head back inside when she spies

A GLINT OF LIGHT By the oak tree in the front She

steps outside Walks down until she sees what it is
Her breath hitches in her chest

A frilly purple ribbon is tied around the old oak tree

And now there are tears in Jolenes eyes Because she
knows what it means

Her husband is alive And he will make it home

Someday
FADE OUT
