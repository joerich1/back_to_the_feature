candy wrapper Palmer examines the room football trophies

Muffled voices are heard outside Palmer looks out the open
window and sees

JUDGE
Has the mother shown up yet

FEMALE CASE MANAGER
No your honor

The Judge focuses on Palmer

JUDGE
Mr Palmer I understand you’re on
parole yet requesting the court
permit temporary custody of the boy
due to special circumstances is
that correct

PALMER
Yes sir

JUDGE
And what exactly are those special
circumstances

Palmer stands incredibly nervous

PALMER
You see awhile back Sam’s mother
took off and left him with me and
my grandmother then she died and
Sam jus’ stayed with me I was
already taking care of him I drove
him to school every morning I made
him sandwiches for lunch He’d only
eat cookies if you let him And
Sam he don’t like to bathe much
but I still made him We even went
trick or treatin’ together and

Maggie quietly watches Palmer pauses emotional

PALMER (CONTD)

You see I hadn’t felt like I was
good at anything in a long time
until Sam I had no purpose
Nothing Now I ain’t blaming no
one your honor I did what I did
when I was younger and I got what
I got And I accept that But the
thing is -- I don’t want one more
regret in my life I got too damn
many And it’s a hard way to live
Waking up every morning wishing you
done something different or said
something you never said When my
grandmother died all I wanted was
five more minutes Jus’ to be able
to say sorry for the things I done
Let her know how much she meant to
me I never got to say that That
woman took me in Twice When no
one else would I don’t want
another regret to wake up to

(pauses upset)
I can’t abandon that boy I jus’
wont And I promise you you
wouldn’t have to worry about him
Id take good care of Sam

The Judge looks evenly at Palmer weighing her decision then
finally she picks up Palmer’s application and reviews it

JUDGE
I see you’re currently employed at
Pineville Elementary

PALMER
Yes sir I’m a custodial engineer

The Judge sees that on the application then flips to the
attached reference letters

JUDGE
Your supervisor John Sibs speaks
well of you as does Sams
school teacher Ms Maggie Hayes I
assume that’s you

MAGGIE
Yes your honor

JUDGE
The address you listed as your home
residence Does anyone else live
there with you

PALMER
No sir It’s my grandmothers
house It’s up for sale But I’1l
have plenty of money to rent a new
place Even closer to the school

JUDGE
I see

The Judge examines Palmer

JUDGE (CONTD)
Mr Palmer you seem like you’re
heading in the right direction
doing well and perhaps once you
have your living situation squared
away and are no longer on parole
you can apply for a license at that
time But for now I’m sorry I’m
going to have to deny your request
for temporary custody My
decision is that the boy will
remain under the care of the state
and be placed into a registered
foster home until the mother is
well enough to regain custody

PALMER
Your honor please His mother is a
drug addict that ain’t happening

JUDGE
I’m sorry that’s my decision

dumbfounded He looks to Maggie who is also stunned We hear

JUDGE
And who are you

SHELLY
I’m Sam’s mother that’s who I am

She stands dignified Shooting a narrowed glance at Palmer
and Maggie who remain silent Shelly sees her name on the
Case Manager’s paperwork points to it--

SHELLY (CONTD)
Right there Your honor please
I don’t know what them notes say
or anyone else But them sheriffs
didn’t even talk to Sam They jus’
came into my home and took him
away They didn’t even say why

electricity deemed dangerous and
you were described as being violent
and agitated

SHELLY
That ain’t true No sir But
