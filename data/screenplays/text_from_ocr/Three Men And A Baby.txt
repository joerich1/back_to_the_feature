her head off Jack leans over and whispers quickly and
intensely to her

JACK

little demonstration of aviation
gymnastics -- reserved only for the
most important guest hip hip

Everyone shouts HOORAY except for Paul and the

Businessman who remain grim

Jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the
cliffs along the coast It is a beautiful impressive
stunt There are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the
passengers

2 INT NEWARK AIRPORT - PASSENGER TERMINAL - DAY
Jack is saying an emotional goodbye to Jane as she leaves
with her teammates Jane finds it all very funny but
Jack looks totally wretched seeing her go
Jack and Paul walk toward the exit

JACK
God what a woman
Paul is nervous glancing uneasily from car to car
JACK
Wanna share a cab
Paul
Yeah sure

A black Ford pulls up in front of them and its driver
looks at Paul who immediately turns his back on him
JACK
Shes so beautiful Ive never
been so in love before Can you

believe she gave me her phone

number Oh Christ -- where is

it Oh no dont tell me I

lost it Its a matter of life

and death Oh here it is --

thank God
All the while Jack has been rambling on a beige car
on the other side of the street has slowed down Paul
notices it In the beige car a narcotics agent GRATON
is behind the wheel with one of his colleagues sitting
beside him

GRATON
Theyre slowing down Take a

picture
The colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to
be standing near the black Ford including Jack and Paul
The black Ford pulls out The beige car follows it
Paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye
PAUL
Listen I need a favor I got

a little problem

JACK
Yeah sure Hey look will you

A very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with
cart overflowing with luggage One of them falls off

Jack races toward the woman and begins to help her
with the fallen luggage We see him talking to her
and we can hear a little of what hes saying
JACK

He kneels takes her hand and puts it over his heart
The young woman is flabbergasted
A lonely-looking Paul hails the shuttle bus

in amazement There is an envelope pinned to the basket

Down there by the meat section

Peter heads for it purposefully When he gets to the
right aisle he stops short taken aback a vast range
of products extends before him He starts examining the

baby food jars and cans of formulas going from one to
the next not knowing where to begin

INT APARTMENT - DAY
Michael is still in the hall holding Mary very clumsily
in his arms He is anxious He realizes shes soaked
This disgusts him He holds her at arms length she
squirms He goes and gets a towel from the bathroom
spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the
baby down on it MARY SCREAMS -- she much prefers
Michaels arms to the couch A panicky Michael picks her
up again grumbling
MICHAEL

Okay okay dont cry like that

Ill hold you Ill hold you
He tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around
the child Obviously Michael is very put off by the
smell coming from Mary

INT SAFEWAY - DAY
Peter is talking with a Safeway CLERK a woman in her
50s who is tall and heavy somewhat gruff and masculine
in appearance and wearing slacks and a smock
PETER

INT SAFEWAY - DAY
Now Peter is surrounded by three women arguing The
Store Clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily
looking down on everyone an efficient practical sort
of young woman (WOMAN 1) and another thin pale woman
whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping
cart and who seems very nervous (WOMAN 2)
WOMAN 1
Does she have any teeth yet or
not That would give us a clue
as to how old she is
PETER
I havent looked

STORE CLERK
(coolly disagree-
ing to Woman 1)
My grandsons only five months old
and he already has two teeth
But my daughter didnt have a
single one at seven months -- so
yknow how many teeth they have
doesnt mean a thing
WOMAN 2
But didnt those friends of yours
tell you what formula they usually
give the baby
PETER
(embarrassed)
No actually they had to leave
unexpectedly They had to catch
a plane
WOMAN 1
(to Peter)
Is she teething
PETER
Teething
WOMAN 1
Does she drool Does she cry all
night long Does she chew on her
fists Does she put everything

into her mouth
She acts out her words
PETER
I know she cant talk
WOMAN 2

But didnt those friends of
yours tell you how old she was
PETER
(as Woman 2 is
starting to get on
his nerves)
I told you they had to leave

They disappear inside the building Peter is carrying
the basket in his left hand his right hand is clenched

Scotch tape Then he buys a box of large diapers -- he
chooses the ones that come in a box Michael leaves the
supermarket whistling

EXT PARK - DAY

Michael is sitting on a bench facing the grass with

his back to us he seems quite busy

As we CLOSE IN we discover that he has opened the box of
diapers and that hes holding one of them its plastic
has been carefully cut out with scissors

Casually glancing right and left he takes the individ-
ual packets of white powder out of his pocket and shoves
them into a little plastic bag from the supermarket
Then he carefully tapes the bag so its well-sealed and
flattened out and he inserts it into the diaper be-
tween the plastic and the absorbent fabric

Next the diaper is taped up folded back up and put
back in the box neatly packed between the other ones
Michael closes the box again and glues it together so

it looks as if its never been opened He throws all

the other stuff away in a trash can and grabs hold of
his brand-new box of diapers He walks away

INT APARTMENT - DAY

Michael comes into the living room with his box of
diapers and a bag of groceries

In addition to the two cops there are now THREE NARCOTIC

Peter sits down stunned

65 INT MICHAELS ROOM - DAY 65
Mary is lying on Michaels bed He has just finished
putting a regular diaper on her

Then Michael looks for the tampered-with diaper in the
box He finds it checks that it is well-sealed and
places it under Marys bottom

Just then Agent 3 appears in the doorway Michael
calmly finishes putting the dope-filled diaper on the
baby on top of the other one MARY is COOING Every-
thing appears normal However a trained eye might be
very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper
covering the young ladys backside But a narcotics
agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to
notice something odd like this

Agent 3 silently observes Michael who gives him a big
smile as he slips on Marys pajama bottoms Michael
picks Mary up and for the first time talks to her in the
kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents

MICHAEL
Okey-dokey honeybunch its time
to go beddy-bye now Were gonna

take a nice long nappy-wappy
He goes back to the living room followed by Agent 3

Agent 1 is in the process of showing Peter a photograph
AGENT 1
Do you recognize anyone in this
picture
Peter looks its the photo of Jack and Paul that was
taken at the beginning of the movie

PETER
(pointing)
Sure This is Jack Collins
AGENT 1
Oh yeah Now thats interesting
Michael has laid Mary down for a nap in her basket
observed by the five cops He now sits down cheerful
and bubbling over with enthusiasm

MICHAEL
So Can I get you something to
drink
Agent 1 totally ignores him
AGENT 1
So whos the baby belong to
PETER
Its Jacks daughter
AGENT 1
And why are you two taking care of
her
PETER

Because her mothers in Europe

to be away for two weeks I took

AGENT 1

All the cops head for the door Michael accompanies
them putting on a very urbane act

MICHAEL

New York in the near future so

Once the cops are gone Michael races back to the living

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT 70

Peter comes out of the elevator key in hand Hes about
to put it in the lock on the door but stops short -- the
door is already open
PETER
Michael Michael are you here
No answer

Peter pushes the door open The sight that greets his
eyes is very dismaying It looks like a tornado has hit
the house Everythings on the floor its all been
smashed its all been ripped apart Gone is the beauti-
ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated In

its place utter devastation and shambles

Peter stands there speechless for a moment then an awful
thought crosses his mind He runs like crazy into his
room -- the baskets not there Stepping over the debris
and all the things strewn over the floor he rushes into
the living room then into Michaels room The baskets
nowhere to be seen

Peter falls apart without even realizing it hes moan-
ing and muttering distractedly He runs into Jacks

room into the kitchen into the bathroom The basket is
nowhere to be seen Peter runs all over back and forth
ten times in all the rooms Tears are flowing from his
eyes

Suddenly he hears FAINT CRIES Theyre coming from the
back bathroom Peter rushes to it practically ripping
the door from its hinges There on the toilet is the
basket and on it theres a note written in big messy
printing which says NEXT TIME WE TAKE HER

Mary looks at Peter and smiles she seems in great shape
A distraught Peter picks her up hugs her tightly and
kisses her all over as he takes her into his room

Just then Michael appears in the corridor silent and

overwhelmed He comes to the door to Peters room and
looks at him Peter mortified to have been caught
kissing Mary hastily distances himself from her hold-
ing her at arms length He puts her down on his bed

and exits the room

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Graton leaps up shouts lets get em and takes off
after the punks followed by about 10 other plainclothes
detectives whod been hiding all around

Michael quickly gets up picks Mary up and discreetly
deposits the dope-filled diaper in a trash can giving
the punk on the bench an intent look Then he goes off
in the direction of the cops

The punk calmly goes over to the trash can takes out the
diaper which he stuffs into his girl friends purse and
goes off in the opposite direction
The cops have meanwhile arrested Peter and Jack who put
up no resistance whatsoever Michael now joins them
MICHAEL

package
MICHAEL

GRATON

box of candy to my friends
Peter and Jack take off their glasses
GRATON

they exchange an intense look
He looks around and suddenly sees Sylvia and two men

staring out wide-eyed
Sylvia is dressed in a very chic tight black suit with
a veiled little black hat and spiked heels One of the
men is carrying a bunch of cameras They walk out
toward the front door and Sylvia suddenly stops She
seems to have forgotten something She kisses them
goodbye and heads toward the elevator Once shes out

running in from his room
SYLVIA
But to work Ive gotta have

PETER
Of course youre taking good

SYLVIA
(sobbing)
Its just cause I havent slept
in four nights -- she must be
teething or something I dont

PETER
Dont worry its nothing shes

cutting a tooth -- you just have
to put some stuff on her gums
MICHAEL

She pulled the same thing on us
We lost all our friends in one

night -- on account of one tooth
SYLVIA

And just look at my face
Nobodys going to want me to
model for them with the way my
face looks And whatll happen
to me if they dont want me

big deal for us

SYLVIA

wiping her eyes)
Really I can leave her with
you for a little while
JACK

Get some rest
Sylvia between two sobs picks up a big bag beside her
on the doorstep
SYLVIA
I brought a couple of things
for her just for a few days
Michael eagerly takes the bag from her Its followed by
a second and then a third
PETER

(taking Mary
in his arms)
Is she hungry
SYLVIA
Yeah its time for her bottle
-- its all ready in the bag
JACK

coffee
SYLVIA
Oh okay thanks

Peter carrying Mary towards the kitchen is followed by
Jack and Michael with the bags
Sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the
hall
In the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags
the bottle the saucepan Theyve swallowed all their
pride and are kissing Mary all over on her neck her
hands her tummy Theyre deliriously happy Michael
takes some sheets out of the bag

MICHAEL
Ill go make up her bed
He exits and once in the corridor prances around
leaping and dancing He gets to the living room and
goes over to the crib suddenly he recoils and freezes
a fearful expression on his face Then he turns and
races back to the kitchen

MICHAEL

(floored)

Hey you guys -- come and see
come and see

PETER
What
MICHAEL
Come see I said
Jack and Peter nervously follow Michael into the living
room They stop short in front of the crib There is
Sylvia curled up in a fetal position sucking her thumb
and sleeping like an angel
MICHAEL
The poor thing shes really
wiped out

JACK
Shell need two or three months
to recover at least Maybe
more

PETER
We could set up a room for her

MICHAEL
A room for her and a room for
Mary

JACK

Then we could have four shifts
instead of three

PETER
Yeah but I dont think shell

to live

MICHAEL

to move here Shed think wed

other night plus the walk in
the park in the afternoon before I
go to work and we split the
rent equally and Ill just be
one of the guys deal
PETER MICHAEL AND JACK
(smiling broadly)

Mary suddenly comes in from the kitchen walking unstead-
ily but determinedly Shes dragging Gratons rabbit by
its ear She looks at the four of them and laughs her

head off
