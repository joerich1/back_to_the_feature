EXPENDABLES

FIRST OFFICIAL DRAFT 12408
EXPENDABLES

EXT GULF OF ADEN - NIGHT

The MOONLIGHT reflects off the calm dark body of water Way
in the distance FAINT LIGHTS on shore indicate a hint of the
PIRATE LAIR known as HARARDHERE The outline of an anchored
25000 ton CARGO SHIP (THE CHEMSTAR) is barely discernible

CUT TO

EXT CHEMSTAR - NIGHT

A 25 FOOT POWER BOAT pulls along side the ship and TEN ARMED
PIRATES aggressively scramble up several HANGING ROPE
LADDERS

INT SHIP - NIGHT

The heavy DOOR to a large unit STORAGE ROOM swings open
revealing the kidnapped crew They are thoroughly exhausted
and suffering from dehydration

The SOMALIAN PIRATES charge into the room and loudly order
the men to their feet Some manage to rise and the ones that
are too weak to comply are savagely kicked and jerked upright
by KNOTTED ROPES that are wrapped around their necks

CUT TO

SHIP’S STAIRCASE

The DARK METAL STAIRCASE reverberates loudly as the BOUND
HOSTAGES are kicked and shoved down toward the bowels of the
ship

CUT TO

EXT - SHIP

The only sound heard is the LAPPING WAVES that strike the
ship’s side The TETHERED PIRATES’ BOAT is seen in the
foreground as a BLACK MILITARY ZODIAC silently drifts into
view On board the outline of FIVE MEN clad in DARK BATTLE
ATTIRE is seen

CUT TO
INT - SHIP

The BOUND HOSTAGES are being shoved and kicked into the
center of the ship’s HOLD High above the HOLD are open CARGO
DOORS that reveal the dark night sky TWO PIRATES stand guard
above the ‘HOLD’ watching the HOSTAGES being abused below

CUT TO

SHIP’S HOLD

The HOSTAGES are being dragged into the center of the METAL
CARGO AREA The PIRATES mock their pleas for ‘help’ and toss
burning CIGARETTES at them Several of the PIRATES pass
around large joints of MARIJUANA

CUT TO

SHIPS UPPER DECK

Extreme CLOSE UP into the LENS of the newest installment of
NIGHT VISION GOGGLES The individual wearing them is not seen
clearly

NIGHT VISION POV

A SOMALIAN PIRATE leans against the ship’s railing while
having a CIGARETTE The NIGHT VISION then pans to a second
PIRATE drinking a BOTTLE OF BEER while keeping ‘lookout’ on
the next DECK up

The NIGHT VISION pans down to a PIRATE seated on the edge of
the cargo hold observing the “HOSTAGE INTIMIDATION” action
that’s transpiring below

CUT TO

SHIP’S HOLD

The PIRATE LEADER bellows orders and the PIRATE CREW kick the
HOSTAGES to their knees while dragging them into a straight
line The LEADER orders another PIRATE holding a small VIDEO
CAMERA to begin filming

The LEADER paces behind the doomed HOSTAGES

LEADER
(in Somali)
We had these men too long
(MORE )
LEADER (contd)
Now someone has to pay The company
had time to pay Three million But
you pay nothing yet - If you do not
care we do not care
(to another pirate)
Hold out that one’s hand

A PIRATE grabs the closest HOSTAGE and pulls his bound hands
upward

CUT TO

SHIP’S DECK

The NIGHT VISION IMAGE moves forward until it’s inches away
from the SMOKING PIRATE leaning against the railing The
PIRATES eyes bulge as a KNIFE is driven into his back

WIDE SHOT - An outlined image of a BLACK CLAD MERCENARY
heaving the DEAD PIRATE over the railing

CUT TO

SHIP’S HOLD

The GAGGED HOSTAGE’S muffled cries for mercy fall on deaf
ears The PIRATE LEADER is playing to the PORTABLE CAMERA

LEADER
A worker needs his hands But you
people don’t pay Does that mean
you don’t need this man anymore

CUT TO

SHIP’S DECK

The GREEN NIGHT VISION HUE pans around and settles on the
PIRATE on the SECOND DECK which is thirty yards away We see
the PIRATE pass to the ship’s super structure and a very TALL
FIGURE clad in BLACK seizes him by the neck and easily snaps
it

The NIGHT VISION POV swings to the PIRATE sitting on the edge
of the CARGO HOLD

CUT TO
INT - CARGO HOLD

The PIRATE LEADER has stepped in front of the cowering
HOSTAGE His temper is beyond the boiling point

LEADER
(to camera)
We have nothin’ we want what
others have you have all you
devils have You will now pay or
their blood is on you You - Hold
up his hands

The LEADER takes a huge MACHETE from another PIRATE
Glowering at the HOSTAGE he raises the BLADE to chop off the
man’s hand

CUT TO

EXT - SHIP’S DECK

The PIRATE sitting on the edge of the ship’s HOLD is suddenly
enveloped in the GREEN HUE of the NIGHT VISION GOGGLES THREE
BULLETS explode into his back thus catapulting him over the
edge

CUT TO

SHIP’S HOLD

The MACHETE is about to descend when the GUNFIRE startles all
present Snapping their attention upward they see the
riddled PIRATE’S BODY crash heavily against the HOLD’S steel
floor

The PIRATE with the PORTABLE CAMERA pans upward as GUNFIRE
erupts from above While dashing for shelter some of this
event will be haphazardly recorded and used in a later scene

The PIRATES regain their senses and fire upward through the
CARGO HOLD OPENING Instantly TWO M-18 colored SMOKE GRENADES
are tossed from above The Room is instantly enveloped into a
billowing hell

HOSTAGES run and crawl in every direction seeking safety
TWO MERCENARIES (HALE CAESAR African American and KONG KAO

Chinese) repel down a pair of ROPE tossed over the CARGO
HOLD’S edge

A THIRD and FORTH MERCENARY who are LEE CHRISTMAS and team
leader BARNEY ROSS lay down cover fire killing TWO MORE
PIRATES then quickly repel over the side into the thickening
smoke

STAIRWELL

TWO MORE PIRATES attempt to flee up the steel steps and are
blasted back by a FIFTH MERCENARY charging towards them This
is GUNNAR JENSEN a large instable old school MERCENARY who
lives for these violent encounters He like all the other
MERCENARIES has a TATTOO on his FOREARM It’s a RAVEN perched
on a SKULL around which is the word EXPENDABLES

CUT TO

THE MERCENARIES

HALE CAESAR and KONG KAO move stealthily through the blinding
smoke which now begins curling through the CARGO OPENING
above

CUT TO

KONG KAO

leaps out of the haze and catches a PIRATE off guard and
crushes him with a savage kick and a finishing blow with his
fist

CUT TO

CHRISTMAS

Heaves his KNIFE at a PIRATE who is firing randomly in the
fading haze

CUT TO

BARNEY ROSS

slides from behind a STACK OF CARGO CRATES and slips a GARROT
around another PIRATE’S neck slamming him headlong into the
ship’s hull

CUT TO
GUNNAR

blows a PIRATE away with his FORTY FIVE but is shot in the
chest by the PIRATE LEADER Luckily his life is spared by a
protective VEST Dropping to one knee he returns fire but
the PIRATE LEADER is gone

CUT TO
KONG
Chases a FLEEING PIRATE up the stairwell

CUT TO
HALE CAESAR
Shoots another ARMED PIRATE who has been cornered

CUT TO

BARNEY

kills a PIRATE who is about to fire on the helpless HOSTAGES
with a MACHINE GUN

CUT TO

KONG

On deck chases the FLEEING PIRATE out of the staircase
opening Suddenly pivoting the PIRATE whips around and
empties the remainder of his clip KONG slips behind a METAL
STRUCTURE then charges out after the PIRATE who leaps over
the railing and begins to descend the ROPE LADDER

CUT TO

SHIP’S DECK

Thoroughly enraged GUNNAR drags the PIRATE LEADER out by the
throat The PIRATE’S FACE has taken a pounding

CUT TO
INT SHIP’S HOLD

Though having been dropped by one of the PIRATES the
PORTABLE VIDEO CAMERA is still functioning

The haze has cleared HALE CAESAR BARNEY and CHRISTMAS have
secured the area

HALE CAESAR
(to hostages)
This all of you

CHRISTMAS’ attention is drawn upward Overhead is GUNNAR
wrapping the repelling rope around the semi-conscious PIRATE
LEADER’S neck

CHRISTMAS
What’s he doing

BARNEY snaps his head toward the HOLD ENTRANCE high above
them

CHRISTMAS
Hey

GUNNAR ignores him while continuing to wrap the repelling
rope around the PIRATE LEADER’S neck

CHRISTMAS
He’s out of it
BARNEY
Gunnar
CUT TO
EXT - SHIP’S DECK - NIGHT

KONG has dispatched his PIRATE and from twenty yards away can
make out the FAINT OUTLINE of GUNNAR and the doomed PIRATE
LEADER

CUT TO

BARNEY AND CHRISTMAS
are riveted on GUNNAR

BARNEY
Let ‘em go It’s over
GUNNAR
- Not yet Not quite

CHRISTMAS
We shoulda shot ‘im last year

GUNNAR yanks the PIRATE upright and turns him face forward
like a man on a gallows

GUNNAR
(loudly declares)
For committing the crime at sea
pirates are hung Everybody knows
that

BARNEY
Let ‘im go

GUNNAR
Just doing what the law won’t

GUNNAR tenses his grip on the PIRATE as he prepares to shove
him over the CARGO HOLD LEDGE At the last possible second
GUNNAR is blind-sided by a arcing KICK from KONG that nearly
drops him to his knees GUNNAR’S eyes fill with rage and he
tosses the PIRATE aside

CUT TO

BARNEY AND CHRISTMAS
observe what just transpired and rush toward the staircase

CUT TO

GUNNAR

Attacks KONG who lands a crushing KICK to the knee and an
ELBOW to the eye that splits the big man’s BROW open

With startling speed GUNNAR turns the tables by parrying
KONGS next blow then seizing him by the throat smashes him
to the ground Instantly there’s a COMBAT KNIFE pressed
against KONG’S throat BLOOD streams along the side of
GUNNARS face

GUNNAR
What were you thinkin’

As GUNNAR presses the KNIFE against KONG’S throat a PISTOL
is jammed against the back of his head
GUNNAR
(coolly)
That you Barney

BARNEY
Yeah - Back off Gunnar

GUNNAR holds fast He touches the BLOOD from the wound

GUNNAR
I’1l need stitches

BARNEY
Could be - Let ‘im go

GUNNAR
Sure after I kill this chink -
Wanna watch

CHRISTMAS pulls back the hammer on his PISTOL

Suddenly KONG slams a knee into GUNNAR’S GROIN and sweeps the
razor sharp BLADE away from his throat then leaps to his
feet

GUNNAR prepares to likewise leap to his feet only to find
BARNEY jamming a PISTOL BARREL under his chin

GUNNAR
(smiles )
Back again

CHRISTMAS
His brain’s cooked

BARNEY reaches into GUNNAR’S pocket and pulls out a SMALL
PLASTIC CELLOPHANE POUCH of METH

GUNNAR
Bad habit

BARNEY
No more chances - You’re done

GUNNAR
How about if I clean up

BARNEY
That’s not going to happen

GUNNAR
I know

GUNNAR almost gently removes the BAG of METH from BARNEYS
hand

GUNNAR

(mock surprise)
For the trip home - Hey old
friend let me up I won’t hurt
anyone - Wait That’s not true
I‘1l kill everyone

(gestures towards Kong)
Especially Mighty Mouse

GUNNAR gestures to CHRISTMAS who is dying to take another
crack at the big man

GUNNAR
Better tie me up Christmas

BARNEY
Do it

CHRISTMAS steps forward to put on the PLASTIC HAND CUFFS At
this moment the PIRATE LEADER begins to regain consciousness
and weakly removes the ROPE from around his neck

GUNNAR’S eyes shift over to the PIRATE LEADER and with a
slight expression of bemusement snaps out his LEG catching
the degenerate PIRATE flush thus sending him over the edge
of the CARGO HOLD

GUNNAR
Couldn’t resist

CUT TO

SUPERIMPOSED CIA HEADQUARTERS - LANGLEY VA
WIDE SHOT OF A DARK SCREEN

We hear the formal cut and dry sardonic voice of AGENT
DIANE LICKSON

Now appearing on the darkened screen is basically the prior
scene only now filmed with a cheap video camera in a very
AMATEURISH fashion

AGENT LICKSON (VO)
This rough footage was taken by one
of the kidnappers who didn’t manage
to survive

(MORE )

AGENT LICKSON (VO) (contd)
The private contractors seen here
are believed to be Americans
according to the rescued French
crew

CUT TO

ON SCREEN

The SHIP’S CAPTIVES kneel in the foreground the ARMED
PIRATES behind them The LEADER speaks directly at the camera
while clutching a MACHETE

AGENT LICKSON (VO)
What you see is pretty self-
explanatory The leader’s
threatening to dismember one of the
hostages if his demands are not
met how original -

The LEADER leans forward to cut off a HOSTAGE’S hands
Suddenly GUNFIRE from above and a DEAD PIRATE drops into
view

Now the footage becomes FRENZIED as the ‘video cam’ pans
upwards catching a glimpse of the MERCENARIES who fire at the
PIRATES below The ‘video cam’ is dropped to the ground and
lies at an ODD ANGLE while continuing to roll

PANIC Smoke GRENADES explode PIRATES fire their WEAPONS in
the direction of the assault

MORE BULLETS screams CURSES
The CARGO AREA fills up with SMOKE

AGENT LICKSON
Fast Forward please -

The TAPE speeds along until the SMOKE begins to disperse
Stepping into view is BARNEY ROSS We hear his voice but
because of the cavernous cargo hold it is not very distinct

BARNEY
Let him go We’re done here

GUNNAR’S voice is heard OFF SCREEN

GUNNAR
Not yet

BARNEY
Let him go

GUNNAR
He hangs

This is when KONG attacks GUNNAR and BARNEY starts to run out
of the shot

AGENT LICKSON
Freeze it
(dryly)
Now that’s entertainment -

A THIRTY FOUR YEAR OLD FEMALE AGENT named DIANE LICKSON
removes her GLASSES and faces SEVEN FELLOW AGENTS
approximately the same age seated around a boardroom TABLE
The lights still remain dimmed

AGENT LICKSON
Even though the Hostages were
French Nationals we believe the
Marseille shipping company hired
American mercenaries to do the job -
And therein lies the problem

She faces the unclear IMAGE of BARNEY on screen

AGENT LICKSON
With local governments unable to
stop piracy flaring up along the
coast of Kuala Lumpur Nigeria and
of course the hell hole of the
moment Somalia there’s no
shortage of employment for
mercenaries willing to go to these
places

LICKSON begins to pace in front of the screen

AGENT LICKSON
Well for this country the ‘wet
work’ is about to end thanks to the
new UN Mandate declaring all
American contractors engaging in
violent clandestine operations on
foreign soil will cease and desist
and if caught in violation will
face serious prison time Since
this operation led to twelve
upstanding Somalian pirates being
permanently dispatched this group
of mercenaries here will be at the
forefront of our investigation

(MORE)

AGENT LICKSON (contd)
We’ve already run the ‘facial
recognition program’ but because
of the tape’s poor quality none of
the men have been positively
identified as of yet - So just stay
on it

AGENT WILL (WILLY) SANDS is an ‘out of the box’
thinker who’s always been at odds with the establishment
mainly because he has a heart Simply put he’s CONFLICTED
His eyes are RIVETED to the image of BARNEY ROSS His mind
churns

AGENT LICKSON
Senior Agent Sands will oversee
this investigation so all reports
should go directly to his desk
first - Thank you

The SEVEN AGENTS rise to exit They glance at WILL then at
one another WILL is an unknown relic to them

LICKSON approaches WILL who continues to stare at the image
of BARNEY

WILL
Thanks

AGENT LICKSON
For what

WILL
Bringing me on board

AGENT LICKSON
It’s been what seven years since
you’ve been out in the ‘field’
When this assignment crossed my
desk I thought of you - Why
wouldn’t I You’ve helped me when I
first got here - Call it even

WILL
(gestures to the screen)
This guy cost me a lot

LICKSON
I know the history -
(gestures to the screen)
So you think it’s him

WILL rises beside LICKSON

WILL
(nods )
Yes - His name is Ross -

LICKSON
Well they’ve been lucky or smart
because there’s been no reports on
their activities for three years
They both head to the exit

LICKSON
Time to pick up where you left off

CUT TO

EXT APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

CHRISTMAS pulls up on a beautiful HARLEY DAVIDSON ‘Night
Rider’ and dismounts He removes a BOTTLE of high end
CHAMPAGNE tucked in his jacket and approaches the building

CUT TO

STAIRCASE

With a sense of purpose CHRISTMAS bounds off of the stairs
and strolling along the balcony arrives at a familiar door

He removes a SMALL BLACK RING BOX from his jacket and flips
it open and studies the 3 CARAT RUBY RING He knocks

A moment later he hears the familiar voice of his girlfriend
LACY

LACY
(through door)
Yes - Who is it

CHRISTMAS
(seductive and playful)
-Christmas is here

There’s an unsettling pause

LACY
Lee

CHRISTMAS
Yeah -

LACY
-I didn’t expect you - I look
terrible

CHRISTMAS

Hey you never looked bad

LACY barely opens the door She’s in her late 20’s She’s a
good soul pleasantly attractive in a very natural way a
North Dakota transplant

LACY
(awkwardly )
You said you called - I look
terrible

CHRISTMAS
You look great to me and I lefta
message

LACY
That was three months ago

CHRISTMAS
Look what I found

He holds up the CHAMPAGNE

CHRISTMAS
Rose flavored - So let me in so we
can let the ‘welcome home’
celebration begin

VISITOR (0S)
Lace -

In the background a THIRTY-ISH clean-cut MAN steps into
view wearing pants and a white T-shirt

VISITOR
-Everything good

LACY
(low)
Yeshe’s a friend

VISITOR
(at Christmas )
Need anything

LACY
No everything’s alright

CHRISTMAS locks stares with the VISITOR For a man who is a
natural fighting machine the fight seems to drain from his
body Leaning against the railing he almost gently places
the BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE on the ground

LACY glances back at the VISITOR and gestures for him to back
off LACY steps outside and stands directly behind the
crestfallen man

LACY
I’m sorry
CHRISTMAS
(softly)
I thought everything with us was
good
LACY
Maybe for you Lee you’re never
around enough You never really

got into my life you didn’t not
the way people who are serious
about each other do - You just come
and go you’re never there when
people need you - It gets lonely
spending holidays by myself I
don’t mean to make you feel bad
because deep down I believe youre
a good guy but time is moving
Lee I need to make a life for
myself

A beat CHRISTMAS digs deep into his pride

CHRISTMAS
- Y’know maybe I’ve done a lot of
things wrong - Maybe it’s payback
for acting like a fool

LACY
You’re not a fool - It’s just the
way you are

CHRISTMAS
So we can get through this

LACY
It won’t work this time

LACY is locked in turmoil

CHRISTMAS
A little talking can’t hurt
LACY
I can’t
CHRISTMAS
How’d ya know till we give it a
try
LACY
Cant
CHRISTMAS
Why
LACY

-I’m pregnant
CHRISTMAS is crushed His life force drained

LACY
-You were never around

CHRISTMAS
Yeah - You’re a good girl Lace
(gestures to the
champagne )
If you don’t mind I’1l leave that

CHRISTMAS descends the steps and fades from view

EXT GRAND HOTEL - DAY
SUPER SAN DIEGO CA

We see BARNEY entering the opulent establishment

INT GRAND HOTEL
BARNEY crosses the lobby and approaches LEE CHRISTMAS

BARNEY arrives CHRISTMAS snaps out of his pensive mood when
he spots BARNEY He removes his IPOD EARPHONES and gestures
towards a pair of MEN seated in the BAR As they move off
BARNEY senses his friend’s dark mood

BARNEY
Who died

CHRISTMAS
We’1l talk later -

CUT TO

BAR

One of the MEN seated in the well-appointed bar is MR
CHURCH He’s 60 YRS OLD and corporate in appearance The
other MAN who is seated a table AWAY is physically GERMANIC
and in his LATE 40’s

BARNEY
Mr Church
CHURCH
Yes
(rising)

You’re not easy to contact Mr
Ross Care to sit Mr Church isn’t
my real name but you don’t need to
know my name Seated over there is
my assistant you don’t need to
know his name either

BARNEY
Alright - What do we need to know

CHURCH
(eyeing Christmas)
It’s alright to talk

CHRISTMAS
Go ahead - I don’t speak English
BARNEY
(to Church)

It’s alright

CHURCH reaches into his jacket and withdraws a PHOTO which
he hands over to BARNEY He looks at BARNEYS FOREARM and
eyes the ‘EXPENDABLES’ tattoo of the RAVEN on a SKULL

BARNEY eyes the photo It is the image of a dead-eyed pock-
marked MIDDLE-AGED HISPANIC man wearing a GENERAL’S MILITARY
UNIFORM He passes it to CHRISTMAS

KAREN an attractive RAVEN-HAIRED WAITRESS comes over
KAREN

(cheerfully)
Hello can I help you

BARNEY
Bookers neat

KAREN
Anything for you

CHRISTMAS
(dully)
Ah three beers

KAREN
Three beers it is

The WAITRESS stares intently at CHRISTMAS who’s oblivious
BARNEY notes this

KAREN
Anything else

CHRISTMAS still not looking at her dully shakes his head
KAREN starts off

MR CHURCH removes a PHOTO from his jacket pocket

CHURCH
Now that’s a photo of -

KAREN unexpectedly turns and returns to the table

KAREN
(to Christmas )
You don’t remember me do you
Karen

CHRISTMAS is perplexed BARNEY sighs He’s been through this
Many times before

KAREN
(struggling to stay
composed )
We went out about ten times

CHRISTMAS
You sure

KAREN holds up her hands On one of her FINGERS is a small
but pretty BUTTERFLY RING

KAREN
You gave me this then you
disappeared I’m just curious what
did I do wrong

Everyone present has become incredibly uncomfortable

CHRISTMAS
How long ago was this

KAREN
Unbelievable -
(to Group)
Sorry but I’ve been waiting a long
time to tell him off but it’s not
worth it

KAREN moves off

BARNEY
Where were we

CHURCH
(handing over a photo)
That’s a picture of General Ruben
Garza Leader of Corza which is a
small barely developed island
nation due east of Cuba

Church lays out a map of the region

BARNEY
(to Christmas )
Ever heard of it

CHRISTMAS shakes his head ‘No’

CHURCH
Not many people have Two years
ago General Garza overthrew the
government and made himself
Headman and the island has been a
human rights graveyard Since Corza
has nothing economically to offer
our government has never gotten
involved and never will

Church slides another photo across the table this one of a
SMILING YOUNG MAN in his early 20s

CHURCH
His name’s Bill Parker my
grandson my daughter’s only son
He loved Corza and it’s people and
travelled there whenever he could
I guess hoping to make some sort of
a ‘humanitarian’ difference

Church passes over a final PHOTOGRAPH

The same YOUNG MAN DEAD Clothes torn to shreds filth caked
across his pale body He lies in a muddy DITCH eyes nearly
as wide as his exposed jugular

CHURCH
On his last visit he was killed -
The locals say Garza’s soldiers
were responsible

This has visibly affected BARNEY CHRISTMAS takes a look but
his mind is elsewhere

BARNEY
Was he stirring people up
CHURCH
He wasn’t like that -
BARNEY
(distantly)

- How’d you get this picture

The WAITRESS sets down the THREE BEERS for CHRISTMAS who
takes a long sip

CHURCH
I hired a private investigator who
went to Corza found his body and
took photos as proof of death He
couldn’t bring the remains home
without risking his own life - His
mother’s taking this badly - Do you
have a child

BARNEY studies the PHOTO

BARNEY
I have a seaplane
(to Christmas who’s
daydreaming)
How’s the view from space

CHRISTMAS
(shedding the fog)
How long was your grandson missing

CHURCH
Least a week or more

CHRISTMAS slips back into silence

BARNEY
That’s it

CHRISTMAS nods ‘yes’
KAREN the waitress arrives and sets down the DRINKS

KAREN

(to Barney)
Bookers for you - And three beers
for the man who wastes your life

She moves off BARNEY angrily eyes CHRISTMAS who is truly
embarrassed

BARNEY
So what do you need Mr Church

CHURCH
I want Garza assassinated -

CHURCH stares straight into BARNEYS eyes

CHURCH
(barely holding it
together)
I want his palace destroyed his
government destroyed his people to
pay - You’re probably thinking ‘If
Garza’s out who will replace him’

BARNEY
It crossed my mind

CHURCH
If he’s still alive the ousted
President Miguel Fuentes should
be reinstated and if he isn’t
then the people should choose who
they want - Either way they’re
better off with Garza gone

BARNEY sips his drink and exchanges glances with CHRISTMAS

CHURCH
You look skeptical - I understand
but from all the research I’ve
done the success rate of your
operations has been very high and
I’m ready to pay whatever it costs
to get Garza back

BARNEY
It’s not just about money

CHURCH
With ‘mercenaries’ I thought it was
only about the money

BARNEY
It’s about one rule

CHURCH
What is it

BARNEY

(simply)
They gotta deserve it

BARNEY picks up the PHOTO of GARZA and stares at it
intensely

INT PRESIDENTIAL PALACE (CORZA) - NIGHT

A JEEP and a TEN WHEELER ARMY TRUCK grind past the MASSIVE
GATES and swing into the courtyard

The PALACE is old and solid and has a forboding aura Large
LIGHTS shine down from the BARBED WIRED walls that surround
this horrible structure

Standing on the PALACE steps is a very large AMERICAN
OPERATIVE named PAINE Beside him are TWO OTHER RAW-BONED
AMERICAN OPERATIVES These MEN are basically professional
killers With dead eyes they watch the FOUR PEASANT PRISONERS
thrown roughly off the rear of the truck The pitiless
SOLDIERS kick the helpless men into a single line

The FRONT DOOR to the PALACE opens and a PAIR OF GUARDS pass
into view followed by GENERAL GARZA Short PARANOID and
withdrawn he studies the men as if they were worthless
insects then nervously scans the surrounding area His
reptilian behavior has everyone on edge All dialogue is in
SPANISH

GENERAL GARZA
(calmly)
You know why you’re here

PRISONER
We did nothing

Another PRISONER tries to object and is kicked by PAINE

GENERAL GARZA
You’re still loyal to the old
president yes

PRISONER
No

GENERAL GARZA
Don’t lie All of you are telling
the truth

PRISONERS
(together )
Yes

GENERAL GARZA
Thank you

Emotionless GARZA ‘pats’ one MAN’S head then takes a large
PISTOL from PAINE’S SHOULDER HOLSTER and fires point blank
into another PEASANT’S head

GENERAL GARZA
(handing back the pistol)
Not everybody tells the truth

CUT TO

EXT NAVAL AMPHIBIOUS BASE (CORONADO CALIFORNIA) - NIGHT

BARNEYS dark 1956 F-100 FORD PICK UP TRUCK is parked on
Highway 75 directly across the base’s entrance

In the passenger seat is CHRISTMAS Still in a pensive state
he listens to his IPOD The song ‘INTO THE NIGHT’ by Benny
Mardones leaks out from his EARPHONES

BARNEYS growing impatient as he observes CHRISTMAS whos
lost in thought The overly dramatic music swells in
intensity as it drifts from CHRISTMAS’ earphones

BARNEY taps his friend

BARNEY
Hey -
CHRISTMAS
(mildly startled)
What

They rise and walk away from earshot of the other men
BARNEY
Where are you

CHRISTMAS
It’s nothin’ - It’s
my problem

BARNEY
When we’re workin’ it’s my problem
too

CHRISTMAS
This one was bad Why can’t I keep
a relationship going It’s starting
to mess with my mind seriously

BARNEY
You pick the wrong women

CHRISTMAS
That’s not it it’s me

BARNEY
How do you figure

CHRISTMAS
I’m a front runner - I start out
strong but I’m never there in the
end - It’s like a bad habit

BARNEY
So you feel worthless

CHRISTMAS
No I didn’t say ‘worthless’

BARNEY
But you thought it

CHRISTMAS
You love stickin’ it to me when I’m
down

BARNEY
No when you’re feeling sorry for
yourself

CHRISTMAS
Who should I feel sorry for This
truck I just need to forget about
meeting a new woman for a while
just enjoy my own company

BARNEY
That’s not you

CHRISTMAS
Seriously don’t you think the guy
who’s probably gonna get along best
with women is probably the guy who
can get along without ‘em

BARNEY
Not really

CHRISTMAS
This talk’s been a waste of time

BARNEY notices something out of the corner of his eye
HULKING MARK approaches

They both direct their eyes to a large uniformed FIRST
LIEUTENANT NAVY SEAL approaching from the base’s entrance

MARK
How you doing Chief

BARNEY
Good Captain - Thanks for your
time Mark

HULKING MARK
Hey Christmas -
(Christmas shrugs)
Heard you guys dumped Gunnar
Jensen

CHRISTMAS
Drug head

BARNEY
No the ‘life’ just got to him

CHRISTMAS
Didn’t get to us -

BARNEY
- Give it time

HULKING MARK
So what can I do for ya

BARNEY
Weve gotta replace Gunnar - Ex-
Seals are always a safe bet so if
youve got someone you’ve worked
with closely someone youve
deployed on important operations -

CHRISTMAS
- Someone you can friggin’ trust
with your life -

BARNEY
Someone gay -

CHRISTMAS
Excuse me

BARNEY

Relax - Have a line on anybody who
fits the bill

HULKING MARK
There’s a guy who came over with an
advanced team of Brazilian
commandos that we then trained for
South American counter insurgency
deployment

BARNEY
You personally trained them

HULKING MARK
Yeah - This one guy who’s the type
you’re looking for quit the
service an’ works here and there

BARNEY
Can you run him down

HULKING MARK
Probably - What’re you cooking up

BARNEY
Can’t discuss it -

HULKING MARK
I respect that - Alright if I find

EXT HALE CAESAR’S KILLER TACOS - NIGHT

This is a colorful two-story BAR and RESTAURANT owned by
mercenary HALE CAESAR Along the length of the building is a
colorful SIGN that reads “HALE CAESAR’S KILLER TACOS”
beneath this is an inscription in script “That Which Does
Not Kill Us Makes Us Stronger”

Over a wide shot of the colorful establishment we hear

BARNEY (VO)
---SO I’ve checked out as much as I
can from the outside but we got to
get up close to see if this is a
‘do-able’ op

CUT TO

INT HALE CAESAR’S - DAY

BARNEY KONG CHRISTMAS and HALE CAESAR sit together drinking
at the rear of the restaurant LATIN TECHNO MUSIC plays in
the background The SIX PARROTS are on their elaborate
PERCHES

A PARROT screeches
CHRISTMAS
Why do these birds gotta be so

loud

HALE CAESAR
People like ‘em

CHRISTMAS
Then put ‘em on the menu

KONG disapprovingly studies a TACO resting in his plate On
his FOREARM and likewise HALE CAESAR is the ‘EXPENDABLES’
TATTOO of the RAVEN sitting on a SKULL

KONG
Why this place ‘Corza’

BARNEY
Maybe it won’t be Corza but we
need to put some boots on the
ground and check it out and see if
it’s worth the risk

KONG
Nothin’ is worth the risk Always
travelin’ - Always bad places -

(eyes the taco)

Always bad food Gets boring
(to Hale Caesar)

I don’t like your food

HALE CAESAR
Why ‘Cause it ain’t movin’

BARNEY
What’s your problem Kong

KONG
My son is going bad

KONG takes the ‘despised’ TACO and puts it on the floor
beside him HALE CAESAR bristles

CHRISTMAS
(to Kong)
What’s ‘bad’ mean

KONG
(ignores Hale Caesar)
‘Bad’ means bad - He’s not growing
up ‘normal’ We’re stupid because
we spend more time helpin’
‘strangers’ than helpin’ our
families

HALE CAESAR
I hear that -

CHRISTMAS
- You don’t have family - You have
birds
HALE CAESAR
You have zero Cabrone

The DOOR opens and RICHARD enters He’s tall very well
built and mysterious a Latin James Dean reincarnate

HALE CAESAR

CHRISTMAS
Think so

HALE CAESAR
(to Christmas )
That’s replacin’ Gunnar

CHRISTMAS
(points to Barney)
His call

RICHARD’S extraordinary looks have definitely gotten the
MEN’S competitive attention

HALE CAESAR
Pretty boys can’t fight

BARNEY
You’re ugly and can’t fight either
so what’s your point

RICHARD arrives at the TABLE

RICHARD
Hey sorry I’m late - No parkin’
around here

BARNEY
Sit down - Everybody this is
Richard De La Fuego - Over theres
Lee Christmas
(pointing)
Kong Kao and Hale Caesar who owns
this death trap - Let’s finish up

HALE CAESAR
Yo where you from

BARNEY
It doesn’t matter -

HALE CAESAR
I’m askin’ a simple question -
Don’t he have a voice

RICHARD is taking it all in stride

CHRISTMAS
Maybe Big Dick’s feelin’ shy around
this group

RICHARD
(extremely calm)
No - But you can call me Richard

HALE CAESAR
‘Richard’

RICHARD
--If you don’t mind

CHRISTMAS
You got a problem with the name
‘Big Dick’

RICHARD
(smiles to himself)
No I have no problem with Big Dick
at all but I like Richard

KONG
Who’d you work for

RICHARD
That’s not your business

KONG
(indignant)
Not my business
(standing)
You got something to hide

CHRISTMAS
Stand on a chair He’1ll think
you’re a giant

KONG
(to Christmas )
Hey
(to Richard)
We don’t have secrets here

RICHARD
(nonplussed)
--Everybody has secrets -

HALE CAESAR
Not here - But tell us what we want
to know or we’ll be takin’ turns
kickin’ your ass

RICHARD
You can try

HALE CAESAR eyes CHRISTMAS challengingly Suddenly a PARROT’S
high decibel SCREECH pierces the room

CHRISTMAS
Jesus It’s like a needle in your
brain

RICHARD

They yell like that when they’re
not nesting - I raised birds
growing up

This stops everyone dead especially CAESAR

CHRISTMAS shakes his head in dismay HALE CAESAR begins to
laugh

BARNEY
If the official ‘ball-breaking’s
done lets get back to business

KONG
How many soldiers does this island
have

BARNEY

It’s a small place - wouldn’t take
more than a few hundred good ones
to control the island

KONG and HALE CAESAR look skeptical

CHRISTMAS
We’‘ll check it out - Maybe it’s not
as crazy as it sounds

HALE CAESAR
Don’t sound crazy to you ‘cause you
are crazy
BARNEY
Right now we don’t know that much
except they’ve got a half-assed
dictator who’s takin’ the place
down and had his men kill a young
American who was helpin’ out the
locals

KONG
So what

CHRISTMAS
(to Barney)
He’s not listening

KONG
I have my own problems

BARNEY
(to Kong)
Let’s hear it

KONG
My son is growin’ up all wrong
The hair the talk the clothes
what he likes is not normal

BARNEY
And you’re ‘normal’

KONG
Yes - I’m normal

CHRISTMAS
Since when

KONG
We are successful at what we do
failures at everything else - we
are the ‘half people’

CHRISTMAS
Seriously stick to kicking people

BARNEY
Kong we’ve been hearin’ this for
years Let your kid be who he’s
gonna be and stop tryin’ to make
him you you’re a one-off And
what’s normal Look at Hale Caesar
A black man named after a bad
weather report who thinks he’s
Mexican normal Not really

(MORE )

BARNEY (contd)
Christmas Normal He falls in love
more than Pepe Le Pew

BARNEY
And me a walking billboard on how
not to live your life if you want
to have a life - I had to wear a
name tag around my kids - So what’s
normal That said this team
doesn’t work without you an’ that’s
too bad cause lately you’ve become
a huge pain in the ass but we love
you

KONG
(smiles )
--Don’t say that
BARNEY smiles and pats KONG on the shoulder

the CENTER of the depressed city

The pair of LOCAL SPIES continue to trail BARNEY and

EXT CITY STREETS (CENTER OF TOWN) - DAY

Loud HONKING TWO MILITARY JEEPS followed by an open back
MILITARY TRUCK crammed with 20 HARD-CORE SOLDIERS rumble
along the narrow main street CORZAN FLAGS fly from the
corners of the hoods of all the vehicles Though slightly
obscured we see BARNEY and CHRISTMAS pass into view

Across the street is a STATUE of GENERAL GARZA on a TEN FOOT
PEDESTAL

The intimidated LOCALS jump aside as the CONVOY approaches an
intersection An OLD MAN struggling to push a RICKETY CART
full of junk out of the way passes in front of the MAIN CAR
HORNS blare The OLD MAN stands petrified This disrespect is
definitely not tolerated

TWO LARGE AMERICAN OPERATIVES dressed in khaki leap from
the LEAD JEEP and berate the OLD MAN

Stepping out of the SECOND JEEP is PAINE The big man is
wearing a conspicuous SHOULDER HOLSTER In his thick hand is
an equally thick short BLACK CLUB attached to a LEATHER
STRAP

PAINE motions to the SOLDIERS who pour out of the TRUCK and
commence to shoving people aside then SMASHING the OLD MAN’S
cart

The TWO AMERICAN OPERATIVES push the OLD MAN and send him
sprawling to the sidewalk as the SOLDIERS RE-BOARD the
TRANSPORT TRUCK The LOCALS share in the man’s pain but are
terrified to show any outward emotion PAINE climbs back in
his JEEP and the motorcade is GONE

CHRISTMAS
They sound American

An OLDER WOMAN suddenly starts to yell curses at the
departing motorcade CAR A group of patrolling SOLDIERS rush
forward and commence to roughing her up ANOTHER WOMAN
(SANDRA) naturally attractive (20’s) implores the guards
to release the poor woman

One soldier is about to drive a RIFLE BUTT against her head
when the SERGEANT OF THE GUARD grabs her and flings her
against the wall curses her nose to nose then moves off

All the intimidated BYSTANDERS quickly move off

Without hesitation CHRISTMAS approaches SANDRA

CHRISTMAS
You alright

She looks confused by the Americans’ presence BARNEY eyes
the departing SOLDIERS then joins CHRISTMAS and SANDRA

I said are you alright You need
help
SANDRA

I am good - Thank you - You are
Americans

BARNEY
Yes

SANDRA
So why are you here

She doesn’t waste words

BARNEY
We’re looking at real estate -
We’re developers

SANDRA suspiciously eyes them

SANDRA

CHRISTMAS
That’s right

SANDRA
There’s not much to see

BARNEY
You never know - Let’s go

BARNEY leans over to CHRISTMAS and speaks so only his friend
can hear

BARNEY

She’s not your type

How do you know

BARNEY
Stay focused

extreme poverty affects BARNEY

SANDRA
How long do you stay here
CHRISTMAS
Depends -
BARNEY
- One day -
SANDRA
(shakes her head at the
irony)

You do like all the rest - Just
come an’ go ‘cause nothing is here
worth staying for

CHRISTMAS
(double entendre)
Maybe there could be

SANDRA
Yes ‘maybe’ if Fuentes was still
here

CHRISTMAS

Who’s Fuentes

BARNEY
Miguel Fuentes - the former
president

SANDRA and CHRISTMAS are impressed

BARNEY
Where’s Fuentes now

SANDRA
Some soldiers have said he’s dead
Some say he’s in prison - No one
knows He was the last chance this
place had

BARNEY
How’s that

SANDRA
He tried to make things better -
When he was president he had
people come to invest - People from
Europe came here to see if there
was anything of value in Corza to
help the people live better

BARNEY
What were they looking for

SANDRA
Gas - Oil - Like what was found
near Cuba last year - They were
still looking when Garza took over
and many people were killed - Now
we are what you see a dying place

A group of SOLDIERS have pinned several YOUNG MEN against a
wall They are being interrogated

CHRISTMAS
They act like this all the time

SANDRA
Most are scared - Garzas killed
many soldiers he thought were loyal
to Fuentes - Now they try to show
how loyal they are to him

BARNEY looks out the window as their VEHICLE passes filthy
bare footed CHILDREN carrying BUCKETS of brackish water and
joyless adults clad in near thread bare RAGS slump against
crumbling HOUSESHACKS

SANDRA
Nobody should have to live like
this -

CHRISTMAS
(sympathetically)
No they shouldn’tAnyway ever
been to the states Sandra

SANDRA
No

CHRISTMAS
You’d like it -

SANDRA
Yes but this is my country - It’s
bad now but I still love it

CHRISTMAS
I understand - But if you can have
a shot at a better life why not

take it

BARNEY
Focus —

CHRISTMAS
Relax -

(to Sandra)
“Tienes che encontrar un hombre qhe
siempre se quedara despierto solo
para verte dormir”

SANDRA eyes him and turns away embarrassed

BARNEY
(to Christmas )
What’d you say

SANDRA
He said - “Someday I will finda
man who will be happy to stay awake
just to watch me sleep”

BARNEY
--Jesus

CHRISTMAS
It’s a compliment

SANDRA
Maybe - But when men talk like that
to a woman they do not know they
sound -
(searching)
‘tonto’

CHRISTMAS
Don’t know that word

SANDRA
(not mean spirited)
Ah - Tonto - Foolish - Like a
fool

CHRISTMAS
(tightly)
Of all the words -

SANDRA
(pleasantly)
I don’t think any serious person
talks like this and means it do
you You can’t

CHRISTMAS

(dry)
Pull over

SANDRA pulls to the side of the dirt road and CHRISTMAS gets
out of the TRUCK

(walking)
‘A fool’ Is it me that’s messed up
or the world

BARNEY
C’mon get in

enters the truck

BARNEY holds up one of the PHOTOGRAPHS of CHURCH’S slain
GRANDSON The PALACE’S TOWER looms in the picture’s
background

SANDRA
Who are you both really

BARNEY walks off the road and holds the picture up again He
steps over a low DIRT BERM

BARNEY
(taking pictures)
Did you know about the American
that was killed here

SANDRA is extremely uncomfortable and remains silent
SANDRA
(awkwardly )
No

BARNEY
He spent a lot of time in Corza -

SANDRA
I don’t know about him

Suddenly they’re alerted by the GROANING ENGINE of a large
MILITARY TRUCK that quickly pulls into view EIGHT ANGRY
SOLDIERS pile out

SANDRA
Oh God - Please don’t say anything
wrong - Let me talk

LEADER

(in Spanish)
What’re you doing here Stay where
you are

The EIGHT SOLDIERS surround BARNEY and SANDRA

LEADER
(in Spanish)
I said - What’re you doing here

SANDRA
He wants to know what you’re doing

BARNEY
Just taking pictures

SANDRA
(in Spanish)
He’s just a tourist

The SARGENT LEADER steps uncomfortably close to BARNEY

LEADER
(in Spanish)
You’re lying Give me the camera
Now

SANDRA
He wants the camera -

The LEADER smacks SANDRA to the ground

LEADER
(in Spanish)
Shut up Puta - You’re next

As BARNEY faces SANDRA the LEADER blind-side punches him

BARNEY STAGGERS but remains upright The CAMERA falls to the
ground

LEADER
(in Spanish)
They move shoot them

Not knowing how to open a digital camera the LEADER SMASHES
it against a rock

SANDRA
(in Spanish)
Please - He’s leaving today We
didn’t do anything

LEADER
(in Spanish)
Lying bitch

The LEADER again goes to strike Sandra but BARNEY blocks the
blow then is blind-sided with a rifle butt to his side
which drops him painfully to the ground

LEADER
(in Spanish)
Get them Take them both Now

Being restrained by one of the SOLDIERS SANDRA struggles for
her life She manages to break free

LEADER
Get her

Suddenly BARNEY rockets his fist into the LEADER’S groin The
LEADER buckles in half and BARNEY breaks his windpipe with a

vicious chopping blow Ripping free the LEADER’S SIDEARM he

puts a bullet through the NECK of SOLDIER 2

Rolling to one knee he blows a hole through SOLDIER 3 and
4s chests

BARNEY then wheels around and fires upward hitting SOLDIER
5 directly under the chin

BARNEY
Run

Nearly frozen in terror SANDRA now runs for her life
SOLDIER 6 races after her

BARNEY is out of AMMO and SOLDIER 7 takes aim

Suddenly a slicing sound cuts through the air and a THROWING
KNIFE buries itself into SOLDIER 7’s chest

As SOLDIER 8 turns in the direction the knife came from a
SECOND THROWING KNIFE buries itself into the man’s HEART

The throaty engine of the TRANSPORT TRUCK roars to life as
CHRISTMAS races into view

Without breaking stride CHRISTMAS tears the THROWING KNIFE
out of DEAD SOLDIER 8’S body then races through the foliage
attempting to intercept the truck

The startled DRIVER attempts to remove his PISTOL as
CHRISTMAS heaves his THROWING KNIFE But the truck’s
TURBULENT motion causes the KNIFE to miss it’s intended
target and imbeds itself up to the hilt in the truck’s thick
WINDSHIELD

CHRISTMAS lunges forward and latching onto one of the truck’s
bare METAL ROOF’S STANCHIONS knees the DRIVER squarely in
the temple knocking him unconscious and out of the truck

The DRIVERLESS truck swerves toward a sheer 300 FOOT drop
off CHRISTMAS rushes to SANDRA and seizing her arm pulls
her off the doomed truck

They must’ve ‘made’ Ross planning
a new op is the only explanation

LICKSON
Thing is if they don’t know who he

know about inner agency rivalry
but I can help here I know how he
operates and you know the locale he
might be targeting next --

Monroe reaches a CLOSED OFFICE DOOR

Look here’s the problem Will we
really don’t care about how he

aside and reaches for the PISTOL in his WAISTBAND

Still charging forward CHRISTMAS whips a THROWING KNIFE that

BODYGUARD who is now taking aim at CHRISTMAS RICHARD swivels
the WEAPON towards EMANUEL who is pulling his PISTOL while
hurling wrathful expletives

With the PISTOL still in the BODYGUARD’S hand RICHARD fires
THREE ROUNDS into EMANUEL who slumps face forward sending
the array of LIQUOR BOTTLES crashing to the floor

RICHARD pulls the PISTOL free and shoots the TABLE BODYGUARD
point blank then blasts TWO MORE BODYGUARDS away that come at
him head on

CHRISTMAS dives behind the bar and leaping up blows the last
charging BODYGUARD away

With their blood boiling both RICHARD and CHRISTMAS rapidly
scan the room for any more ATTACKERS No threats left only
the chaos of the fleeing PATRONS

But suddenly the fatally wounded BODYGUARD that CHRISTMAS
impaled in the face rumbles into the room with CHRISTMAS’
KNIFE now raised high for the kill

To avoid hitting CHRISTMAS RICHARD leaps to the side and
fires But just as the BULLET hits the mark the startling
visual of KONG appears soaring onto the BODYGUARD’S NECK with
his LEGS clasped in a vice-like grip

Like a steer wrestler KONG uses all his momentum and
violently somersaults the THUG forward until the man’s NECK
snaps brutally against the floor

KONG rises and eyes CHRISTMAS

looks over his shoulder at MONROE then returns his gaze to

the MAP

MONROE
What’re you doing in here

WILL
That photo I asked you about was
taken in Corza

MONROE
Have you lost your mind One phone
call that’s all it’1l take and
what’s left of your half-assed
career is over

WILL turns to face MONROE

WILL
Could be be that as it may Id
like to know what’s so important on
that island that would attract you
and mercenaries

MONROE
If what you’re looking for is
redemption youve definitely
stepped into the wrong office

WILL
What’re you talking about

MONROE zero’s in on WILL like a snake facing down her prey

MONROE
You know what I’m talking about
Agent - I read your file It’s sad
very very sad because at one-time
you were actually a functioning
part of this agency - Intimate with
the way we do and do not do the
craft of intelligence then eight
years ago the wheels came off when
you were assigned to track down
‘mercenaries’ lead by a man named
Ross ring a bell It should then
for some insane reason maybe just
inborn ignorance you let these
bastards get away with breaking
into not one but two sanctioned
agency detention centers in Poland
and Romania and free targeted
political detainees “detention
centers” that were sanctioned by
the Secretary of Defense himself

WILL
People were being taken in the
middle of the night without any
evidence and thrown into a hole for
years -

MONROE
You’re not ‘the good shepherd’ -
You failed Will

WILL
Even the head of this agency
condemned it

MONROE

We ‘spun’ it that way because of
you You made Ross the ‘good’ and
us the ‘bad’ So your career goes
down the toilet the marriage
follows and the bottle’s your only
drinking buddy You covered up for
a mercenary who couldn’t give a
crap about freeing political
prisoners he would’ve freed Hitler
for the right price So he’s living
the high life and you’re in the
basement analyzing data no one in
this organization really cares
about

(softening)
You made a mistake don’t make a
second one - Here

MONROE opens her desk drawer and produces a BLACK AND WHITE
PHOTO

It is an aged long lens PHOTO of a BEARDED MAN in his late
50’s She passes it to WILL

MONROE
That’s Hashim Al Tais - You know
who he is

WILL
The middle east’s not my expertise

MONROE
He’s one of the high ranking but
low profile remaining officers in
Al-Qaeda You asked why we’re
monitoring Corza -

MONROE paces
MONROE
He’s on Corza and using the island
we believe as a sanctuary to
rebuild the organization’s chain of
command Within a year we expect
this cell’s potential to pose a
serious threat to National
Security

WILL
If you know that then why are you
waiting to take him down

MONROE

Because we’re still gathering
information Corza’s small a hard
place to blend in so we need to

We can’t afford anything less than
100 success on this op

WILL is taken aback by this information

MONROE
I’m being straight with you - If
you know anything of real value and
care about this country you’1l
share it now

WILL struggles for a moment
MONROE

Do you want to be remembered like
you are or could be

WILL
An assassination is being
planned

MONROE
By who

WILL

Ross and his men

MONROE
Against Al-Tais
WILL
No names are mentioned but the
‘course of action’ strategy is laid
out in detail I read it myself

MONROE
When

WILL
Three days

MONROE

Christ - they really don’t have a
‘code’ when it comes to money
Excuse me I have to get on this
while there’s still some time

WILL starts towards the door very conflicted he pauses

WILL
I think I know the best way to stop
‘em

MONROE
How

WILL
(weakly)
We had a similar situation in that
part of the world in ‘99

MONROE
And

WILL
Corza falls under the operational
umbrella of Seal Team One that’s
still stationed at the Naval
Amphibious Base in Coronado If the
assault team is deployed at least a
day before Ross’ group arrives
that’1ll be enough time for them to
position themselves and remove the
mercenaries before your operation
with Al-Tais has been compromised

MONROE
(lifts her phone)
Get me Johnson at NCS
(to Will)
What you’ve done will be known by
the ‘right’ people

WILL admits an exhausted sigh and exits

MONROE
Can you find Ross Quickly that is

GUNNAR JENSEN
I can find him

MONROE
He’s become a security danger

GUNNAR
Spare the bull shit

MONROE
The compensation is agreeable then

GUNNAR nods almost imperceptibly

MONROE
(rising)
Good He treated you badly now
it’s only right he gets what he
deserves

GUNNAR rises and stares down at her in an intimidating
fashion

GUNNAR
If I didn’t need the money youd
‘deserve’ to go before him

With that said GUNNAR steps into the darkness leaving a
shaken MONROE in his wake

Suddenly the rear window of BARNEY’S vehicle shatters and a
blizzard of tiny glass shards blast through the car More
shots and the front windshield is blown to pieces

BARNEY and KONG whip around and see an SUV charging toward
them BARNEY floors it

KONG
It’s Gunnar
BARNEY
Should’ve shot ‘im when I had the

chance

CUT TO

GUNNAR

is behind the wheel of the SUV and is bearing down hard on
BARNEY and KONG BARNEY swings his truck onto an intersecting
highway and roars towards an older industrial part of the
city

The highway is nearly deserted but there are enough vehicles
present to cause a half dozen near misses as BARNEY and
GUNNAR weave through the oncoming cars All the while KONG
and GUNNAR exchange sporadic gunfire

BARNEY tears down a wide alley barely keeping several lanes
ahead of GUNNAR who manages to get off several shots

In the near distance he spots a FREIGHT TRAIN moving in the
opposite direction He races towards it with GUNNAR in hot
pursuit

BARNEY floors it as his truck is getting dangerously close to
intersecting the monster FREIGHT TRAIN The RAILWAY CROSSING
LIGHTS begin to flash but BARNEY barrels ahead

KONG
What are you doing

CUT TO

Again GUNNAR attempts to draw a bead on BARNEY while keeping
an eye on the freight train but the road’s too rough to get
a clean shot

CUT TO

BARNEYS TRUCK

Streaks across the TRACKS missing the train by at least 50
YARDS

GUNNAR is also going to make it safely across but to his
horror he sees BARNEY from the other side of the tracks
whipping the truck into another 180 DEGREE TURN BARNEY grabs
the PISTOL from KONG and fires headlong at GUNNAR’S SUV

CUT TO

SUV

GUNNAR involuntarily SLAMS on the breaks bringing the SUV to
a skidding stop nearly in the center of the tracks

GUNNAR’S EYES bulge as the immense FREIGHT TRAIN rams into
the rear QUARTER PANEL of the SUV sending it PIN WHEELING 50
YARDS off the tracks and past BARNEY and KONG then capsizes
over an embankment

BARNEY and KONG leap from the truck and charge over the
EMBANKMENT Cautiously moving forward BARNEY checks the AMMO
in his PISTOL’S CLIP

CUT TO

With it’s HEADLIGHTS still on the badly damaged vehicle lays
on it’s side STEAM pouring from under the hood BARNEY and
KONG approach and notice the driver side door is open

BARNEY motions for KONG to swing wide while he approaches the
SUV BARNEY approaches from an angle that permits him to see
fully inside

Suddenly the GUNSHOTS rip through the silence and the rear
passenger window explodes inches away from BARNEY’S HEAD

He dives to the ground as more BULLETS tear into the car’s
metal

CUT TO

GUNNAR

BLOODY and badly shaken up he puts his pain aside and rushes
forward Suddenly BARNEY rolls from his position and FIRES
back but GUNNAR holds his ground and returns FIRE Suddenly
the high caliber PISTOL is KICKED from GUNNAR’S hand and
falls a short distance away

KONG rushes into view and commences to ferociously attack
GUNNAR with all his fury Completely caught off guard GUNNAR
is dazed and staggers against a clump of TREES KONG goes in
for the kill but GUNNAR rises and strikes KONG with an
arching back fist delivered by his MASSIVE ARM Now it’s
GUNNAR’S turn to attack

CUT TO

BARNEY

flips the door mounted AUTO SEARCHLIGHT into the darkness and
the BEAM settles on GUNNAR who kicks KONG with such brute
force KONG is sent flying and collides in a semi-conscious
state

GUNNAR glares into the stark white BEAM of the AUTO
SEARCHLIGHT BARNEY sees GUNNAR in his sights and is about to
shoot

KONG
No He’s mine

KONG attacks GUNNAR who again dominates with his incredible
strength and grabs KONG by the throat in a similar fashion as
the first scene

KONG cracks GUNNAR against the EYE which frees him up KONG
now zeroes in on his stunned opponent and proceeds to rally
back Badly weakened by the barrage GUNNAR’S knees are
repeatedly assaulted until the huge man drops to one knee
Glinting in the car beam is his PISTOL only a foot from his
hands

BARNEY
(aiming)
Gunnar it’s over - Don’t move

GUNNAR seizes the PISTOL and KONG leaps on him But in a last
burst of barbaric strength kicks KONG aside and trains the
PISTOL dead into KONG’S face

BARNEY squeezes off a SHOT and GUNNAR collapses to the
ground KONG glares at his foe and backs off as BARNEY
approaches They pass each other while looking straight
ahead

KONG
I would’ve won

BARNEY
(walking straight past)
Maybe

GUNNAR is moments away from death Blood seeps from a fatal
CHEST WOUND

GUNNAR
I tried

BARNEY
Came close

GUNNAR

Needed money

BARNEY
Shouldve asked me

GUNNAR
(soft revelation)
Shit - I’m dyin’
BARNEY
- Looks that way - Who hired you
Gunnar
GUNNAR weakly shakes his head

BARNEY
You’re not telling

GUNNAR’S eyes indicate he’s remaining silent

BARNEY
An asshole to the end

GUNNAR’S eyes slowly shut He’s moments from death

BARNEY
You know youre dying - So what
difference will it make - I’d tell
you - Ill pay for your funeral and
scatter your ashes right before the
next battle fair enough

GUNNAR’S eyes slightly open and his BLOODY HAND weakly rises
and seizing BARNEY’S shirt slowly pulls him forward

directly over his shoulder as he watches the moment between

Eyeing the nearest WINDOW he crosses the eight foot span and
LEAPS just as the BALCONY DOORS violently swing open and
GENERAL GARZA charges into view

OPERATIVE 3s midsection

THE BATTLE IS ON WHAT ENSUES IS A REMARKABLY SAVAGE EBB AND
FLOW BATTLE TO DESCRIBE THE ACTION DESIGNED FOR THIS SCENE

instantly OPEN FIRE

Lethal chunks of MORTAR and STONE are ripped from the walls
as the torrent of bullets rain down on OUR BOYS

PAINE and the OPERATIVES hug the floor for dear life
BARNEY pulls MIGUEL FUENTES out of the line of fire

whips out his NINE MILLIMETER and returns fire but takes a
