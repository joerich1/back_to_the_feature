A pleasant room furnished with a bed dresser chair
Dr Verringer is talking with ROGER WADE who sits on
the bed Roger is a huge man wno looks tough and mean

that problem for yourself

have any trouble with Verringer

MARLOWE
Not really He was trying to
get a large sum of money out of
Roger before he let him go
That was why the brush-off this
afternoon

EILEEN
Was it blackmail

MARLOWE
Im not sure Apparently Roger
had made some promise to pay him
I thought the whole business had
better wait so I got Roger out

and shoves him back onto the sofa

a gun

Back where

AUGUSTINE
To Mexico

MARLOWE
How do you know I went back to
Mexico

AUGUSTINE
I made it my business to know
cheapie All of a sudden I got
an interest in you

The chief hood lays the pistol across Marlowes head
a swift sharp blow to encourage him

AUGUSTINE
What did you go back for

MARLOWE
I put a marker on Terrys grave
It seemed as though somebody
ought to

AUGUSTINE
You put a marker on Terrys grave
Jesus And what else did you do
in Otatocian

MARLOWE
What did they tell you I did

Somebody met Terry after I left
him Somebody took him up there

went a hell of a long way to do
it But I dont think it was
suicide I think it was murder
I think whoever took him up there
killed him

The hoods finish with the sofa

protectively People are coming and going lab men

with a man who holds a doctors bag The detective

is making notes

The medical man leaves The detective returns to Eileen
and Marlowe

MARLOWE
What did the ME have to say

DETECTIVE
What would you expect him to say
Mr Marlowe Now if youll just
2D run through a few of these points
in your statement Mrs Wade

MARLOWE
The ladys had a hard day shes
told you everything why dont you
let her alone

e
Ql

CONTD

DETECTIVE
- (quite impersonal)
This wont take long I will read
back to you your statement about
your husband Mrs Wade Please
listen carefully
(reads)
Roger was an alcoholic he was
very depressed about his work
he had threatened suicide on a
number of occasions I think he
had been under some kind of
psychiatric care Question
Dont you know Answer He kept
it secret from me but Dr
Verringer can tell you At
the Sunnyside Spa Is that
correct

EILEEN
Yes

DETECTIVE
You hired Mr Marlowe to get your
husband away from Dr Verringers —
care Why

EILEEN
I hired Mr Marlowe to find my
husband I had no idea where -he
was at the time and I was worried

MARLOWE
Roger left Verringers of his own
free will He wanted to leave

DETECTIVE
Is this list of witnesses to your
husbands behaviour at the party
substantially correct

EILEEN
(looks at it)
Yes

DETECTIVE
Your husband was upset about
Verringers visit he threw
everybody out of the house and
then came back and found you alone
with Mr Marlowe

Ql

“CONTD EILEEN
He found me alone period I had
asked Mr Marlowe to wait because
I was afraid As you can see I
had reason

MARLOWE
The lady and I only met yesterday
Hardly time enough to develop a
steaming passion I told you I
was out on the terrace

DETECTIVE
Your husband began beating you
Mrs Wade Do you know why

EILEEN
He thought or pretended to think
that I was lying to him about what
Dr Verringer had said

DETECTIVE

‘About rejecting him as a patient

EILEEN
Thats right

DETECTIVE
And when did Mr Marlowe come in

EILEEN
As soon as he saw what was
happening

DETECTIVE
He didnt fight with your husband

EILEEN
There was no need to My husband
was and coward I suppose I have to
admit that He ran off to the
study and locked himself in

DETECTIVE
And then you heard him breaking
things

EILEEN

That was nothing unusual for Roger

DETECTIVE
You didnt try to stop him

Ql

CONTD No we knew he was going to blow
his brains out and we didnt want
to interrupt his train of thought
Besides we were busy having an
affair For Christs sake What
do you want Mrs Wade was trying
to wipe tne blood off her face
se was in there taking aspirin
when we heard the shot Roger
was a psycho He talked to me
about deathsuicidethis
afternoon Beautiful he said
Sweet silken swift He seemed
fascinated by the recent suicide
of a man he knew

DETECTIVE
Oh Who was that

MARLOWE
Terry Lennox Maybe that tipped
Roger over the edge Maybe it
was something else But he was
ready and waiting to be tipped

DETECTIVE
And there was no more definite
motive you can think of Mrs
Wade that he might have had for
killing himself Marital problems
perhaps

EILEEN
It must be quite obvious that our
marriage was not flourishing But
that was nothing new either

DETECTIVE
Wed like you to come down to
Headquarters and sign a statement

MARLOWE
Mrs Wades can wait until tomorrow
cant it Ill come with you

EILEEN
Please I really dont feel up
to it

EILEEN
Yes hes dead Theyre all dead
So what difference does it make

MARLOWE
Terry Lennox was my friend If
he didnt kill his wife I want
that known And if it is known
perhaps the police will be more
interested in finding out what
really happened to Terry

EILEEN
Whatzeally happened

MARLOWE
Somebody killed him as sure as Im
standing here and I want to know
who

EILEEN
But he confessed

MARLOWE

Why would he confess if he didnt
do it And you know he didnt do
it So the note was a forgery
Why was Marty Augustine here last
night

Sylvia Lennox

EILEEN
Yes He killed her
¢ Go on tell me about it
EILEEN

He was having an affair with Sylvia
You asked why he hated Terry Lennox
-»-it was because of her He was
jealous And I think perhaps
Terry had found out about them

I think perhaps Sylvia wanted to
break it off Roger went to see
her that day and I knew it He
didnt come back When I heard
that shed been beaten to death

I knew it had to be Roger But
he was my husband I felt I had to
protect him And then there was

He looks at a womans brightly-colored coat thrown over
a chair (perhaps the same one Eileen was wearing when
she came out of Augustines)

CONTD

tracks

was sorely tempted

TERRY
I suppose he told youI couldnt
have worked it without him and
the doctor ‘The suicide I mean

MARLOWE
He didnt go into any great
detail just admitted that th
suicide was faked

TERRY
I was out the whole time of
course The doctor gave me a shot
They used a blank cartridge to
simultate the head wound Ive
still got a powder mark there
probably always will have

MARLOWE
Small price to pay

prints and so on Then they
smuggled me out of town and buried
a coffinload of stones

MARLOWE
Very artistic performance It

Augustines three hundred and
sixty grand

TERRY
He told you about the money

MARLOWE
He mentioned it I never knew
you were Martys bagman You
were smart to get the rest of it
back to him

TERRY
How did you

MARLOWE
They were beating the shit out of
me trying to find out where the
money was and all of a sudden
they stopped Then I saw Eileen
coming out of Martys place How
is Eileen

TERRY
Shes fine She went into town
Marty was looking for me He
came to Otatoclan

MARLOWE
Yeah He landed on Eileen too

TERRY
From what she says He thought
I might have left the suitcase
with her Anyway I knew hed
never stop looking

shed done for me and what a loath-
some character I was

MARLOWE
