a VERY YOUNG Rudy in a tuxedo It says Rudy Moore - BUGGY
RIDE

RUDY

A hand lifts the record up to the face of RUDY RAY MOORE late
40s black sweet determined

RUDY
When I sang this on stage I swear to
God people fainted Ambulance man
was picking them off the floor When
I had a gig the promoter would warn
the hospital Rudys on tonight --
youre gonna be carrying bodies out of
the motherfucking club

We see that we are in a RADIO BOOTH A sign blinks On The
Air The DJ ROJ frowns at the record

ROT
Buggy Ride

RUDY
Wasnt no small-time shit

ROJ
GodDAMN Rudy That records 1000
years old Ive got Marvin Gaye
Singin Lets Get It On I cant be
playin no Buggy Ride

(beat)

Look I have 60 seconds I have to
cue the next tune

Hm Rudy bites his lip and walks away

Roj tries to go back to his job He reaches for a Sly Stone
single -- when Rudy suddenly bounds back up

RUDY
How about Step It Up and Go Thats
a real catchy rhythm-and-blues number

Rudy lifts ANOTHER SINGLE in a plain cover The label says
Rudy Moore The Harlem Hillbilly STEP IT UP AND GO

ROJ
Oh cmon man For real

RUDY
Its monumental That was my biggest
selling single Just slip it into the
rotation

ROJ
It looks like something my grandpa

Rudy starts SINGING it in a Little Richardesque early rock and
roll style Shout-singing

RUDY
(SINGING)

Ring a ling dong Ding dong ding
Ring a ling dong
Ring those wedding bells for me

Rudy finishes grinning pleased Roj shakes his head

ROJ
Rudy man my job is to play the hits

RUDY

But it should have been a hit

(a poignant pause)
The label Federal Records had big
plans to promote it I was primed for
stardom But then they signed
another guy James Brown and he
sucked up all the attention

Rudy quiets down remembering back Wistful

Roj feels bad Then -- he commiserates
ROJ
You think I wanted to be a DJ ina
ghetto record store Not all of our
dreams come true

RUDY
(bothered)
They still can

ROJ
(he shakes his head)
No brother We missed our shots

Rudys face falls He wants to disagree -- but has no words

ROJ
We should both get back to work

Roj slams the glass booth door in his face then DROPS the
NEEDLE

And -- Sly Stone KICKS IN with Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice
Elf Agin)

Lady Reed takes a breath shakes her head and walks away

We can see it on Rudys face He just got scared

INT DUNBAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Rudy wanders across the quiet lobby alone staring at all the
equipment A shelf of wigs He touches a rack of costumes

Then he thinks of something He opens his desk drawer -- and
inside is his old FAMILY PHOTO The black-and-white shot of
the seven barefoot kids and two parents He stares hard at
his FATHERS FACE Severe Doubting Rudy glares back

RUDY
Fuck you

Apprehensive Rudy grabs a photocopied Dolemite script He
flips through the pages We PUSH IN to him as he stares at
the words This is what it has all been building to

RUDY
Fuck you you no-business born-
insecure junkyard motherfucker

Rudy is distracted by the photo The eyes of the abusive step
father staring back at him from his desk

RUDY
Thought I wasnt shit huh -- look at

He gets angrier HUSKIER LOUDER

RUDY
You aint NOTHIN You no-business

strong Ready

First day of shooting The CREW is setting up the scene The

set dec is ridiculously minimal -- fake wood paneling a desk
an American flag

Nicks small crew adjusts the camera and lights

Off to the side we reveal Rudy alone Just staring at the
activity His face filled with wonder

Then -- Jerry quietly walks over He smiles

JERRY
Youre really doing it arent you

Rudy doesnt speak He just nods
ON SET

Sitting in their positions waiting are Lady Reed on a couch
and a white MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR playing the Warden She looks
around a bit overwhelmed by all this activity He smiles

MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR
So howd you find yourself on this
production

LADY REED
Oh Well Im Rudys protege He
discovered me on the road and hes
giving me my big break
(coy)
I guess Im what youd calla
Hollywood ingenue

She bats her eyes a little absurdly

LADY REED
And how did you get cast

MIDDLE-AGED ACTOR
Well I sort of specialize in playing
the bad white guy around town All
the black shows need a heavy I
played the plantation owner at the
Ebony Showcase I played a Southern
lyncher at the Cultural Center I
played a rapist at the Wilshire Ebell

LADY REED
(her eyebrows go up)
Sounds like you figured out what you
were good at

IN THE CORNER

DUrville is huddled with Rudy and Jerry DUrville is upset
waving script pages at them

DURVILLE
This scene makes no fuckin sense

RUDY
Why not

DURVILLE
Why not Why the fuck would a prison
warden release a prisoner so he can
go undercover

JERRY
(indignant)
Because theres a drug issue in the
neighborhood Were dealing with
society Keepin it real

DURVILLE
Oh cmon Thats a bullshit answer
You guys are pretending like the
warden is the same as a policeman
Hes not Wardens dont investigate

RUDY
Youre forgettin that the warden is
working with the governor

DURVILLE
WHO GIVES A SHIT Hows that make
sense

RUDY
Cause the governor is friends with
Queen Bee

DURVILLE

Thats jibber-jabber So youre
saying cause the governor is pals with
a lady who runs a whorehouse hes
making the prison spring her friend

RUDY AND JERRY
YES

DUrvilles eyes pop He wipes his face frustrated
DURVILLE
Fine Fuck it Whatever you guys
want
DUrville staggers away freaked

Nobody knows what to do The cast and crew are scared
DUrville hears the FILM still running He ELBOWS Nick

DURVILLE
Psst Dummy Youre wasting film
Cut the camera

Nick turns it off Everyones head swivels -- to Rudy He
feels all eyes on him Hes in charge Rudy straightens up
faux-dignified then strides over In his white underwear he
shakes the mans hand

International Films

PRINCIPAL

high school And you cant just set

There are rules You need to go
downtown and file paperwork

Rudy is stymied He has no idea how to respond to this

Until Jimmy suddenly pipes up

JIMMY LYNCH
We did

Jimmy rustles through some papers then magically pulls out a
sheet that has the word PERMIT hand-written in pen

The Principal stares at this in disbelief
Everyone is still -- wondering if this trick will work Then

PRINCIPAL
Aw cmon now

RUDY

(he throws his arm around him)
Look brother I understand you have

Rudy grins as the girls redress him in a crazy baby blue pimp
suit A wide-brim hat A massive collar-cape

BEHIND THE CAMERA
DUrville covers his face Miserable he whispers to Nick

DURVILLE
In the next scene he takes off his
fancy blue suit and screws the whores
(beat)

So whys he getting dressed in the

a second Why would a man strip down
and put on a ruffled suit if he knows
hes about to take it right back off

NICK

-- or Cher

DUrville stares morosely unsatisfied He empties his vodka
into some orange juice then drains it Looks around

DURVILLE

DUrville perks up Nick squirms trying not to brag
NICK

Rudy now fully pimped out in his new threads tosses his old
clothes at the principal playing the prison guard

RUDY (AS DOLEMITE)

Rudy walks away laughing DUrville drinks

snaps just inches from Rudys head

Rudy smiles Got it He tries to copy Howard but he SLIPS
Howard has to grab him so he wont fall

(still reading)
In the guise of blaxploitation a
corrupt white establishment versus a
ghetto anti-hero it spews hatred and
debases human beings

Debases What the hell does that
mean

(sulky)

It means we failed in our attempt to
show the gritty truth of the streets

Oh fuck that Jerry Nobody cares

against the glass

CLOSEUP - RUDY

He stares back A moment between them Until -- his friends
TUG on him

JIMMY LYNCH
Rudy Man what are you doing I
dont wanna miss the credits

BEN
Seriously dude We gotta go in I
wanna hear my song

But Rudy is in his own space He ignores them Then softly --

RUDY
Ill be right back

WIDE ANGLE - LOBBY

Rudy is framed against the glass wall With the throbbing
crowd and the Boy out front

In silhouette he fixes his Dolemite coat He adjusts the
brim of his hat just so And then -- he moves out

EXT THEATRE - SAME TIME

Rudy pops back outside And the crowd ERUPTS He strides up
to the boy

RUDY

The boy reacts Wow The kids FATHER steps through
BOYS FATHER

playful)

BOY

But then I make it about me

The kid starts doing a HUMAN BEAT BOX sound Boom ba-da-
boom Boom ba-da-boom

And then he BEGINS RAPPING --
Rudy grins

BOY
Youve heard about Dolemite and Shine
and the Titanic
But theres a new kid around whos
gonna be gigantic
I live in the hood but that cant
hold me
Im gonna move to Beverly Hills
and dont you try to scold me

and JOINS IN They start circling each other

RUDY
Hey boy who do you think you are
Dont you know you cant topple the
worlds greatest star

BOY
Ha When it comes to rhymin
I was through with it
before you old chumps
ever knew what to do with it

RUDY
Oh yeah I chained down thunder and
handcuffed lightning

frightning

BOY

milkshake

RUDY
(startled)
Hey Thats my line

BOY

Cause Mighty Donald is my name --

RUDY AND THE BOY
(gleefully together)
And fuckin up motherfuckers is my
game

Rudy and the kid BREAK INTO LAUGHTER Rudy is delighted
winks at the boy and pats him on the back

RUDY
Son you got the gift Dont let no one
tell you you cant be whatever you want

The kid lights up Rudy leans in to the dad

RUDY

He

AT THE DOOR

Lady Reed steps out She hurries over to Rudy

LADY REED

Hey Cmon now You gotta go in
RUDY

But theyre gonna be out here all

night
CLOSEUP - RUDY

He peers around overwhelmed By the yelling the cacophony
the lights the chaos

And then -- he smiles beatifically at her His voice drops to
a hush

RUDY
You know what You just go back in
Enjoy yourself Have a blast

LADY REED
But Rudy that aint right

RUDY

Aww Ive seen the picture Its

audience

(he gestures to the mob)
But all these folk have come out to
see me and theyre gonna be here
all night and maybe I should respect
their loyalty

(beat)
You know just hang with them Give
‘em a little show while they wait

He grins down at the boy The boy grins back

LADY REED
Now baby thats crazy

RUDY
(he smiles)
Nah Im serious So you go in now
Eat some popcorn and have fun at the
movie
(he gestures Go)
Ill be good

Lady Reed shakes her head incredulous Then she gives a
reluctant nod Okay She walks back to the theater She
turns and gives Rudy a final look then goes inside The
ushers pull the glass doors shut

ANGLE - RUDY
He is left alone with the mob They gape at him in disbelief

And then Rudy jumps up onto a pole He holds out his arms
and SHOUTS OUT TO THE MOB

RUDY
HELLO MOTHERFUCKERS

The CROWD excitedly ROARS BACK

CROWD

DOLEMITE
Jesus The street THUNDERS

There he is on the posters and there he is standing in their
midst Like some magic has occurred

Rudy peers around at all their faces and smiles joyfully
This is what matters He hops down then starts WALKING DOWN
THE SIDEWALK The line is thick people four five across
spilling into the street

RUDY
Ladies and gentlemen its such a
pleasure to have you all here tonight
Im sorry its gonna be a bit of a
wait

Rudy just gently pushes his way through The crowd mystically
parting faces smiling as he gladhandles his adoring fans
giving friendly hugs shaking hands

RUDY
But dont worry -- dont you leave
Cause I can promise you its worth
it Oh yes it is This movie is a
full evening of entertainment

Rudy turns the corner -- and we SEE that the LINE goes all the
way down the block truly as far as the eye can see

But Rudy doesnt flinch Enraptured he keeps walking giving
people hugs shakes signing autographs Caught up in this
full of emotion he begins RHYMING a TOAST

RUDY
Cause you know what they say
(he launches in)
Dolemite is my name
And rappin and tappin is my game
Im young and free and just as bad as
I wanna be
Look at me Im a rare specimen of a
man dont you agree
(MORE)

RUDY (CONTD)
Every night I sign my own autograph

book
And never pass a mirror without taking

a second look

We slowly CRANE UP and AWAY Rudy getting smaller swallowed
up into the sea of people until finally the massive
DOLEMITE MARQUEE COMES INTO VIEW

RUDY
Live the life you love and love the
life that you live
From the frantic Atlantic to the
terrific Pacific
Be the best of whatever you are
Reach out for the moon
but if you miss it
(beat)
Cling to a star

The marquee FILLS THE FRAME The King Kong-sized painted
cutout of Rudy is triumphant fist punching into the sky

FADE TO BLACK

THE END

RUDY RAY MOORE 1927-2008
