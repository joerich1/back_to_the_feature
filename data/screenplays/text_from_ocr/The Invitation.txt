DARKNESS

The SOUNDS of a summer barbecue a backyard pool party
Children squeal and splash Adults chat around the grill As
these sounds continue we FADE IN ON

EXT BACK YARD - DAY

A static shot of an EMPTY BACK YARD-- a tranquil sunny
expanse of grass overlooking the Hollywood Hills A soft
breeze rustles through the trees A sliver of patio in the
foreground hints at a pool

There are no people present Just the SOUND OF A PARTY from
some time ago strained through someone’s memory

Snippets of conversation of laughter and gossip Meat
sizzles as it’s thrown around the grill

All of the sound abruptly ends in a ringing silence

But the shot continues in silence-- the peaceful empty yard
evening sun throwing long shadows

ABOVE LOS ANGELES - DUSK

The sun has already set Color fades from the landscape as
the sky grows dim The hills become an ominous dark outline

Sounds mix together low barely audible broken
transmissions strange animal cries quiet voices The things
that creep into the sky both human and inhuman organic and
mechanical

We move down through the haze to find HEADLIGHTS winding up
through Coldwater Canyon into the Hollywood hills The lights
turn onto a narrow twisting road

IN THE CAR

A young man WILL (30s) drives in silence We linger on his
face as he concentrates on the road Behind his placid
expression we can see something pulling at him There is a
haunted quality to his eyes

EXT HOLLYWOOD HILLS - SAME
The car continues its purposeful climb drawn into the
darkening tangle of streets the orange-blue haze of dusk

giving way to blackness

IN THE CAR
A long moment on Will’s face his eyes The only sound is
that of the engine muffled by the closed windows It’s
claustrophobic

VOICE (0S)
Will

The voice is jolting We widen to see that this whole time
someone has been next to him

KIRA (30s) is capable and watchful There is quiet
familiarity between them a resigned tension

Will looks over

KIRA
I asked if you were okay

WILL
Sorry

He shakes his head a little bit ridding himself of a
thought

WILL
I’m back

He smiles turns back to the road Kira looks at him

KIRA
We don’t have to do this We can
just go home

WILL
No it’s okay It’s just going to
have to be okay

KIRA
If it feels like too much being in
that house again

WILL
Ill be fine

They drive in silence Kira looks down at the INVITATION she
is holding

CLOSE ON IT - a stately party invitation A bit formal but
stylish “CELEBRATE WITH DAVID AND EDEN”

KIRA
Who’s going to be there tonight
WILL
Tommy and Miguel everybody else
youll meet All my old friends I
guess that’s the point Getting
everybody back together

Kira turns the invitation over in her hands

KIRA
This thing is so thick
(smiles )
Official

WILL
Maybe they’re overcompensating
Tough to just call people up after
two years

KIRA
Nobodys seen her

WILL
No

KIRA
Jesus

WILL

I mean I ran into her once I saw
her and David going into the
supermarket together I couldn’t
deal I just sat in the car until
they left A little bit after that
I heard she just disappeared

KIRA
They met in that grief group

WILL
Yeah while we were still married
She loved it I couldn’t stand it

(pause)

Somebodys bawling while you feel
fine Someone’s passing out cookies
while you’re coming apart It just
made me angry

KIRA
You needed an anger group to deal
with the grief group

WILL
I didn’t want anyone’s help
KIRA
It’s okay to need someone’s help
sometimes

This could open into something more It doesn’t

WILL
You could’ve put odds on our
divorce I guess

KIRA
People don’t think like that

WILL
Yes they do

He shakes his head

WILL
The things she did right after it
happened Kira it was fucking

terrifying I thought she was going
to die too

Will looks over at her taps the invitation
WILL
Though this is just the kind of
thing shed

SUDDENLY A FLASH

IN THE HEADLIGHTS - an animal darts in front of them A flash

of fur and teeth
No time to react

A SICKENING THUD as WILL slams on the brakes
twist through the beams of light

Splaying limbs

The invitation flies off Kira’s lap and onto the floor The

car screeches to an abrupt halt

WILL
Jesus
KIRA
What was it
WILL
I don’t know Animal
(unbuckling)

Stay here
EXT ROAD - DUSK 6

The car sits idling Will gets out moves toward the front of
the car The hazard lights blink

WILL’S POV - we slowly round the front of the car Closing
in A glimpse of an animal’s leg

ON WILL as he sees what it is He recoils

ON THE GROUND in front of the car-- a twisted shape A
mangled coyote It’s in its death throes its cries a raspy
gurgle One bent leg twitches involuntarily

The sound of a car door opening

WILL
Don’t come up here

Will walks to the trunk He reaches in and pulls out a TIRE
IRON Closing the trunk he sees Kira standing over the
coyote staring at it

He walks toward the front of the car puts a hand on her
shoulder

KIRA
What are you going to do

WILL
We can’t leave it like this

KIRA
We can call someone The city

WILL
Just go back to the car okay

She looks down sees the tire iron She knows what’s
coming heads back to the car

Will looks down at the bloody dying animal

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 61

Kira watches as Will lifts the tire iron and brings it down
on the coyote which is obscured by the hood of the car

Even in the car the impact is audible She flinches at the
sound

He strikes it again Again
IN FRONT OF THE CAR

Will drops the tire iron He looks down at what he’s done
Then steeling himself he grabs the dead animal by its feet
and drags it to the side of the road

INT CAR - CONTINUOUS

Kira watches as Will comes around the front of the car and
gets inside

They sit there for a moment Will is a little out of breath
Kira looks at him then forward Shocked

She puts a hand on his arm
Will both hands on the wheel doesn’t answer Finally

WILL
How the fuck can she go back to
that house

KIRA
People deal with things in
different ways She’s trying

WILL
And I’m not

KIRA
You said that not me
(pause)
Maybe she wants to let people in
Maybe she wants to make some new
good memories in that place

WILL
I don’t think things work that way

EXT ROAD - DUSK
The car moves up the narrow road in the hills headlights
glinting off parked cars Everything seems precarious

somehow Dark and twisted

They drive past lines of parked cars closely packed on the
side of the road Just a glimpse unseen to Will and Kira

in one of the nearly identical BMWs a man is sitting
there still and waiting

101

102

They continue up the street pulling up to house on street
and stopping behind three other cars

The house above is a modernist masterpiece hanging off the
side of the hill Sprawling beautiful a classic Will cuts
the engine

KIRA
This was your house

WILL
Lot of money in Eden’s family

KIRA
No kidding

WILL
Wasn’t ever mine
EXT DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

As they walk up the driveway Will stops The house glowing
from within has an obvious hold on him a power over him

Kira unconsciously makes a move to take his hand but stops
herself They walk up the steps to the house

EXT PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Conversation spills out from inside The door is ajar

A FLASH Wills POV the same house YEARS AGO A young boy
is visible in the window doing a puzzle on a low table
BACK IN THE PRESENT

Will pushes the door open The people in the house turn to
look at Will and Kira

We play across the guests’ faces for a long moment Men and
women in their 30s Will’s friends They smile
apprehensive No one seems to know where to start

Finally a woman breaks the spell stepping toward Will and
Kira-- GINA a lively presence a quintessential eastsider

GINA
You’re here Fucking A I win

KIRA
Was there a betting pool

101

102

TOMMY strong mischievous comes forward and kisses her His
partner Miguel stands back a little smiling

TOMMY
For entertainment purposes only

Gina acknowledges Kira smiling

GINA
I’m Gina We met once a ways back
right

KIRA

Oh yeah right Hi

GINA
Nice to see you

TOMMY
Kira you are looking so hot right
now I can’t believe it Will you
please bear a child for us

MIGUEL
Were not kidding Tommy
impregnate

She laughs

KIRA
So I see you two are having all
kinds of problems getting along

MIGUEL
Another 8 years of this is about
all I can take Then he can marry
me or I leave
(to Tommy )
You hear that

Tommy puts an arm around Will’s shoulder

TOMMY
You look good Will You’ve shed
that dirty dishrag vibe that has so
concerned me

WILL
I look like a dirty dishrag

TOMMY
Looked like Seemed like Were
103 Tommy leads him arm still around his shoulder into the 103
sunken living room where CLAIRE intellectual and a bit
awkward sits next to BEN a wry vaguely stoned guy splayed
on the couch Claire gets up hugging Will

CLAIRE
Is this Kira

KIRA
That’s me

Without getting up Ben nods to Kira and extends his hand to
Will in mock-formality

BEN
Hello Kira Hi Will I’m Ben You
remember me We drove a thriving
business into the ground together

WILL
It never thrived

BEN
It thrived like a motherfucker for
three months And you know it

KIRA
Sorry were late

Gina’s eyes widen a bit conspiratorially

GINA
It’s been an interesting half hour

Will tilts his head inquisitively

GINA
Youll see

WILL
Where’s Choi

GINA
I don’t know Late as usual Can’t
get any reception up here either

WILL
Is Eden

A voice from the hallway

EDEN (VO)
I’m here
104

Will turns toward his ex-wife’s voice

And we see EDEN She is intimidatingly beautiful She walks
across the room toward them with a grace that’s almost

ethereal--

she practically floats across the room

Kira can’t help but be struck by the sight of her Her eyes
flicker to Will “This is your ex-wife” He steps forward to

meet Eden

Eden hugs

She peruse
calm and b

Her manner

Will for a long time finally pulling back

EDEN
Let me look at you Will

s him arms draped over his shoulders Her face
eatific her eyes searching his

EDEN
Mmmmm

seems very strange to him He’s taken aback

EDEN
I missed you

WILL
Me too

EDEN
House doesn’t look very different
does it

WILL

No Not really

EDEN
We’re so glad you’re here

We notice something on Will’s face a tiny spot a smudge We

realize it

‘s A BIT OF THE COYOTE’S BLOOD

Eden notices it too and smiling wets her finger and wipes
the fleck of blood off Will’s face

EDEN
You’re a mess
(turning to Kira)
And you’re Kira

KIRA
Hi I thanks for having me

104
105

106

107

Eden turns and beckons a very fit VERY GOOD LOOKING MAN He
comes toward them eyes shining with powerful life a strong
focus He wears a distinctive LEATHER BRACELET on his wrist

EDEN
You remember David

WILL
Of course Sure

A flash David sitting in a therapy group a stark circle
the greenish industrial light of a rec center Colliding
shots he is crying Composed Head in his hands Will and
Eden watching him Wills arm is around Edens shoulders
David looking up meeting Edens eyes A wreck

David moves past Will’s offered handshake straight in for a
hug

DAVID
Very glad to see you Really glad
man

WILL

Hey How are you

DAVID
Brilliant We have so much to talk
about We have so much to celebrate
together tonight

He reaches over to Kira pulling her out of her conversation
and hugging her close as well

KIRA
Okay

DAVID
Beautiful Welcome What can I get
you to drink

He turns toward the bar where many bottles have been set
out Tommy leans toward Will

TOMMY
I’d suggest going with the wine
It’s an ‘85 Rothschild

Gina has overheard this

GINA
Are you shitting me

105

106

107

WILL
What does that mean

Tommy and Miguel look at him with pity

TOMMY
Oh Will
(to Miguel)
Isn’t he sad

Gina leans in

GINA
It’s like 8 million dollars a
bottle cro-mag

David starts to pour the wine

DAVID
Please 6 million This night is
special We shouldn’t put off
enjoying what we have Since
everybody is here

BEN
(calling out)
Except Choi

TOMMY MIGUEL
Fucking Choi

People laugh A well-worn joke in this group Will sits down
on the edge of the couch away from the others

BEN
Fucking Choi

DAVID
Right We’1ll just have to start
without him

108 He raises his glass gaining everyone’s attention 108

DAVID
Just a few words
(pause)
This is a reunion We’ve been away
a long time and you are all very
special to Eden And that means you
are all very special to me

Everyone’s attention is on David but something else catches
Will’s eye-- a movement in the darkened side hallway

Someone is standing there watching them

It’s a GIRL maybe 21 or 22 wearing only a tight t-shirt
naked from the waist down

Sleepy-eyed she stares directly at Will a weird smile on
her face

DAVID (0S)
We invited you here because we love
you and we’ve missed you We’re
all on a journey and we should be
on it together

Will’s eyes are fixed on her She slowly breaks eye contact
and drifts away into another room

DAVID
This dinner is the start of that
We wanted to open the house again
To give it and us a new start

Everyone toasts savoring the wine

GIRL (0S)
Hey save a glass for me

The girl now dressed slinks out of the hall and up to
David who laughs as she grabs at his glass kissing at his
neck

Looks from Kira to Ben to Tommy who is this

There’s something unsettling about her energy skittish an
abused animal On her wrist the distinctive leather

bracelet

EDEN
Sadie meet my friends

SADIE
Hi

She laughs uncomfortably

BEN
Hi Sadie I’m Ben

KIRA
So uh how do you guys know each
other

SADIE

Um Friends in common I guess

EDEN
We met in Mexico Sadie’s staying
with us for a while Just helping
out

SADIE
Yeah it’s fun We have fun I
hope you don’t mind me crashing the
party It’s awesome

She looks at Will almost conspiratorially

SADIE
They’ve just told me so much about
you

She trails off still looking directly at Will Ben clears
his throat Kira breaks the increasingly uncomfortable
silence

KIRA
We hit an animal on the way up
here

WILL
It’s not

KIRA

It just came out of nowhere There
was nothing we could do

(shaking her head)
It was in just horrible shape It
was making this sound

Everybody looks at Will

GINA
How did you not tell us this like
immediately

KIRA
He had to kill it It was
suffering

GINA
You killed it with like

WILL
A tire iron

BEN
I don’t know how you did it man
That’s pretty butch

111

112

DAVID
You did a good thing It was mercy
Good

Will looks around a little disturbed He lands on Eden
She’s just staring at him serenely

WILL
Mind if I look around

EDEN
Of course not

Will goes alone to the kitchen
SADIE
Wow
INT KITCHEN - DUSK
Will leans against the sink breathing for a second Only now
do we see how shaken he is He pours a glass of water for
himself

As the water runs into the glass-—

A FLASH - years ago in the same kitchen - Will enters Eden
turned away at the sink Sobbing Something in her hands

WILL
Eden

She doesnt answer but at the sound of Wills voice her
Movements become hurried A glimpse of a knife

Will is on her as she SLICES OPEN HER WRIST

WILL
Eden

BLOOD SHOWERS THE SINK as Will struggles to wrest the knife
from her Eden is hysterical desperately trying to cut her
other wrist Her blood on him her tortured wail rising--

Suddenly-- someone right behind him A hand around his waist

EDEN (0S)
Will

Startled Will drops his glass It rattles in the sink but
doesn’t break

111

112
WILL
Christ

He turns to see Eden smiling at him

WILL
Sorry You scared me

EDEN
(motioning to the sink)
No harm done
(pause)
Youre very handsome tonight
Youre shining And Kira you’re
both really beautiful

She moves to a high cabinet reaching for some

EDEN
Could you help me

He comes to her reaching up

WILL
These bars on the windows are new

EDEN
Oh I don’t know I was alone
here for a while
(she shrugs)
Security It’s safer

glasses

As Eden reaches up for another glass Will notices a leather
bracelet on her wrist The same one David and Sadie wear

WILL
That’s nice

She looks confused then touches the bracelet
for a second

EDEN
Oh thanks we got them in
Mexico

WILL

Is that where you were for the last
two years

EDEN
Some of the time
(pause)
Were you worried about me Did you
think about me

self-conscious
113

WILL
Yeah I did

She nods looking intently into his eyes

EDEN
I’ve never been better I’m
fantastic You don’t have to worry
about me anymore

Will studies her

WILL
It’s not hard for you to be in this
house again

EDEN
Not at all and it doesn’t have to
be That’s what’s so incredible

WILL
You look different

EDEN
I am different I’m free It’s
over All this useless pain it’s
gone

WILL

What are you talking about

EDEN
It’s something anyone can have and
I want you to have it too

Ben enters interrupting this

Ben wraps around her giving her a big kiss on the head Then
he lets her go and dives into a plate of hors d’oeuvres Eden

smiles

BEN
Eden looks hot I’m allowed to say
that right We’re all consenting
adults

EDEN
It’s good to see you Ben

BEN
You too Way too long Eden

He pauses to look her almost acknowledging the emotion of
the situation Instead he hits the hors d’oeuvres harder

113

BEN
All right don’t mind me I just
came in for the food What were you
talking about
(pause)
Not my business

EDEN
I was telling Will that pain is
optional

BEN

It is Why didn’t somebody tell me
that before now

EDEN

(getting excited)
I know I know But it’s really
pretty simple All of the negative
emotions grief anger
depression it’s all just
chemical reactions It’s entirely
physical and it’s entirely
changeable

BEN
You kind of sound like a pamphlet
there Eden

EDEN
You can actually learn to expel
those emotions from your body so
you can live life the way you want

to

BEN
So you’re shitting out your
pain

Eden seems to take it in stride turns her attention to
prepping some of the food

EDEN
I can see you’re not interested

BEN
I’m sorry Eden but that sounds
fucking crazy

She turns and SLAPS him across the face hard enough to more
than get his attention A stunned moment

BEN
Eden what the fuck

WILL
Eden

She smiles enigmatic

EDEN
Ben until you stop making a joke
out of everything you won’t learn
a thing That’s why no one cares
what you think

BEN
Whoa Uh okay

He tries to laugh it off but is clearly thrown She leaves
the kitchen with the glasses

BEN
(laughing)
She fucking gored me

Will keeps an eye on Eden as she mingles in the living room
passing out some caviar from a tray

BEN
It was fucking LOUD

WILL
Has she been like this the whole
night

BEN

You mean with all of the Topanga
Canyon new-agey beautiful-
everything bullshit Yup David
too

WILL
She’s like a different person

BEN
Look I’m all for whatever you
gotta do to get by especially you
two what you went through But
(pause)
But you didn’t lose your mind

WILL
I didn’t

BEN
(nodding toward Eden)
Not like that

Will shrugs They watch Eden a moment more

BEN
Have you seen upstairs They put in
a screening room dude

WILL
What Really

BEN
I don’t know how that fits into the
pain-shitting but it’s pretty
sweet actually

Ben smiles hesitates Takes a drink Then

BEN
How are you

Will looks at him for a long moment involuntarily tearing
up
WILL

I don’t know I don’t really know
how to act

BEN
Well it’s not just like the good
old days you know

WILL
No

Ben shrugs They look out the window for a moment There is
more to say No one says it

WILL
Where’s Amanda

BEN
Home with the kids Pissed

WILL
How are Robbie and Lucia

Ben hesitates a bit at this topic Sort of shrugs

BEN
Big Getting bigger Good
(pause)
Amanda though

WILL
What’s up

BEN
I think we hate each other

WILL
That’s not good

BEN
Yeah I know But the sex it’s

still so angry I can’t get
away

Will puts an affectionate arm around his shoulder

WILL
It’s good to see you

BEN
You too
(pause)
Nobody cares what I think
INT LIVING ROOM - SAME 12

Will and Ben come back into the living room where Eden is
setting out the caviar on a side table

Sensing them Eden turns and smiles warmly as if nothing had
happened

EDEN
Ben have a glass of wine I’ve let
it go already and so should you

Ben grudgingly takes the drink

BEN
All right then

EDEN
See It’s already gone

She takes Ben by the arm He shrugs and gives in and she
escorts him into the living room

Will now alone takes a look around the room His friends
talking together him separate

WILL’S POV

He sees David off by himself speaking into his cell phone

David is hunched over furtive seeming He snaps shut the
phone looks out the front window toward the driveway for a
moment As he turns

Someone grabs Will’s elbow

CLAIRE
Come sit with me Ask me a
question

Al21 Claire leads him to the stairs pulls him down next to her Al121
ON THE STAIRS

Will looks across the room David has joined the others but
glances back at the front window again Claire prods Will out
of his distraction

CLAIRE
I meant it Ask me something

WILL
Okay How’s work You’re up for
tenure right

She smiles at him

CLAIRE
Yeah I got it A year ago

WILL
A year ago Really

CLAIRE

(nods)
Had a party and everything UCLA is
stuck with my unbelievably gloomy
seminars for the forseeable future

(she smiles)
At least until the oceans rise and
swallow us Which is soon

A pause

WILL
I’m sorry About

CLAIRE
You don’t have to be sorry You’re
here now

They watch the party for a second
121

122

123

CLAIRE
It’s weird to be here isn’t it

She leans her head on his shoulder a gesture of sisterly
familiarity He seems grateful for it

WILL
I don’t know why anyone would call
your teachings gloomy

CLAIRE
Me neither

HEADLIGHTS play across the front window From where he sits 121
Will sees a car pull in

It wedges itself in the remaining space in the driveway
blocking in the other cars The car door opens

ON THE STAIRS 122

CLAIRE
Maybe that’s our hero Choi

David has seen the car arrive too He goes to the front door
and opens it calling down to the MAN in the driveway

CLAIRE
Who’s that

WILL
I don’t know

AT THE DOOR - NIGHT 123
PRUITT arrives embracing David
Pruitt is a very large imposing man but with a sweet face--
the vibe of a reformed con who has found religion David
turns presenting him to the room
DAVID
Everybody this is my friend
Pruitt

Pruitt doesn’t make a move to greet anyone Instead he just
stands there taking in the group as if sizing them up

PRUITT
Evening

A SHRIEK Sadie comes bounding up to Pruitt leaping onto
him and kissing him

SADIE
All right

PRUITT
Darling

SADIE

I couldn’t believe it ‘til I saw
you You’re really here

They hug each other for a moment oblivious to the others
Finally Ben makes a move

BEN
Hi I’m Ben Nice to meet you

They shake hands Will notices the same leather bracelet on
his wrist-- the one Eden wears and David and Sadie

David clasps Pruitt on the back

DAVID
My man Glad you’re here
(to the room)
Someone want to get my friend a
drink

BEN
(to Pruitt)
I’m on my way What can I get you

PRUITT
Anything diet is fine

Ben dispatches himself

TOMMY
It’s great to meet you Pruitt
But frankly where the HELL is
Choi

PRUITT
Choi

GINA
My asshole boyfriend Hi Gina He
promised me he wasn’t going to
leave me hanging Was gonna be
early Made a big deal of it It’s
fine I’m great with it

PRUITT
Oh

GINA
David he didn’t call you guys say
he was going to be late

David shakes his head

DAVID
I assumed you were coming together
We haven’t seen him

GINA
That’s it I’m gonna try again

She pulls out her cell phone

GINA
You guys have service up here

DAVID
No Almost never

On WILL’S FACE this registers David was on the phone
moments ago

EDEN
Sorry the bills fell through the
cracks while we were away We never
had them come out here to hook the
land line back up

GINA
It’s just a little weird of him He
usually at least calls

David moves over to the door behind Pruitt and Sadie

DAVID
You could try calling from the deck
if you’re worried That’s your best
chance

-and he DEADBOLTS THE DOOR and pockets the key

124 As David turns back to the party he meets eyes with Will
sees Will looking at the deadbolted door

DAVID
Everything okay Will

WILL
Why don’t you just leave the key in
the door It’s like a fortress in
here

124
125

David shrugs

DAVID
You know just a month ago there
was a home invasion further up the
canyon This couple was terrorized
It was really sick Everybody
around here was freaked out by it

WILL
I never heard about that

TOMMY
Then I’m sure it didn’t happen

BEN
Yeah come on Will Can’t a man
put himself in lockdown if he
wants This is America
(to David)
You guys should have a gun

WILL
What if there was a fire

Kira catches his eye Mouths the words--

KIRA
Give it a rest

David smiles calmly and unlocks the door

DAVID
I just keep the house a different
way Will That’s all
(pause)
It’s my house

Eden puts a hand on Will’s shoulder interrupting
EDEN
Will could you do me a favor and
get some firewood You know where
we keep it

Will nods accepting that he’s being dismissed He grabs a
canvas log carrier

AS WE FOLLOW HIM out through the living room we see Kira in
the background

WITH KIRA

125

She watches Will pensive as he goes outside A hand on her
shoulder It’s Eden

EDEN
Has he been like this a lot So
agitated

She looks at Eden measuring her before deciding how to
respond

KIRA
Sometimes

Will moves further down the hallway toward a closed door 126

EDEN (VO)
I’m sorry But it’s really good he
has you It comforts me

KIRA (VO)
I know he wants the best for you
too

He puts his hand on it He cannot bear to open it

EDEN (VO)
I’m glad you’re here tonight Kira

KIRA (VO)
I think it’s important

Will walks away down the hall to the door leading outside

EXT BACK PATIO BACK YARD 13
Will opens the door and walks out into the night air

He can hear the muted sound of loud music echoing up the
canyon from another party He takes a breath

EDEN (V0O)
Can I ask you something How has he
been handling things He can be
self-destructive

KIRA (VO)
I think he’s doing the best he can
Eden I’m not really comfortable
having this conversation okay

EDEN (V0O)
Oh I was just asking I feel
connected to you

He walks slowly around the pool In the distance the lights
of the city spread out before him The lit-up homes of the
canyon hang near on both sides

EDEN (V0O)

And I just worry about him How

he’s dealing with things You

wonder
On the other side of the pool the yard extends out a good 50
feet before dropping off into the night Will looks across
the grass unwilling to step out onto it-- as if something is
out there

SOUNDS INTRUDE - sounds from the past Sounds of panic and
chaos A SCREAMING rises

Will stares at the spot in the grass
Behind him A LIGHT GOES ON We see Eden silhouetted in a
window Will turns watching her through the wall of glass

Her bedroom is lit up like a diorama

Eden moves around the bed pulling something out of her
pocket She is obscured for a few moments Hiding something

When she comes back into view her hands are empty

She leaves the room The light goes off

Will turns back toward the still-open door He takes several
logs off the pile puts them in the carrier and takes them
inside

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Will moves back up the hallway The door to Eden’s bedroom is
closed

He sees everyone in the living room wrapped up in their own
conversations Unseen Will puts the firewood carrier down in
the hall and walks toward Eden’s bedroom

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Will looks around Looks at the bedside table

He knows that he’s wrong He can’t help himself

Finally in Eden’s bedside table carefully placed in the
back of the drawer Will finds it

161

A quarter-full BOTTLE OF PILLS The bottle is unlabeled

Will studies this He plucks out one of the pills and puts it
in his pocket Then he carefully puts things back in order

He walks toward the door
And David appears in it
David stands there blocking his way

The two men look at each other David with a smile on his
face Will caught red-handed

David keeps smiling but says nothing He walks past Will and
DEADBOLTS the door to the outside

He passes Will on the way back

DAVID
Come back to us when you’re ready

Will watches him walk away turn the corner into the hallway
Thinks about following but seems stuck there

He takes a breath Notices the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - SAME 16
his eyes falling on the tub

ON WILL’S FACE

The sound of voices gentle splashing

The camera moves around Will back to the tub to find WILL 161
AND EDEN IN THERE TOGETHER YEARS AGO

Eden relaxes against Will looking content and warm They
feel to us like completely different people

Will fishes a washcloth from the bottom of the tub He starts
to wash Edens chest with a goofy look of concentration She
laughs

WILL
Youre very dirty there

EDEN
Really

WILL
(kissing her)
Yes Attention to detail is
incredibly important
He continues washing her making her laugh even harder

WILL
It is my credo

EDEN
Its your credo

Suddenly another voice can be heard Will and Eden stop
look up-- Ty their son is peeking through a crack in the
door Hes giggling
WILL
Why dont you go back to bed
buddy Well be quieter

The boy looks at them as if doing a mathematical problem in
his head Then he turns and leaves

WILL
So thatll be the time he saw his
gross parents having sex

EDEN
We are gross

A pause

EDEN
Do you think he needs a brother

Will smiles

WILL
He could probably use one

She turns looks back at him They kiss She rolls over to
face him

A loud SCREAM
GINA (0S)
No
INT BEDROOM HALLWAY 162

ON WILL’S FACE

17 Pulled back to the present He rushes down the hall to the
living room to see everyone gathered together

GINA
No way

All of them including Gina turn to see Will

GINA
They’re in a cult

DAVID
Oh come on Gina it’s nota
cult

MIGUEL

I know plenty of people who do the
Invitation Eden are you guys
really in it

EDEN
We are
CLAIRE
So that’s why you were in Mexico
TOMMY
Did you guys get all naked in the
jungle
SADIE
Sometimes
Pruitt laughs
SADIE

Well I did

DAVID
It’s just people who have lost
someone coming together to help
each other It’s science not some
weird religious cult or anything
It’s people like us in LA and New
York Smart successful people
Youd be surprised Thousands of
people came through last year

BEN
Yeah my boss is into it It’s like
a new EST or something right

DAVID
Well it’s a little more practical
than that More grounded But
spiritual too however you define
that

MIGUEL
Seriously what goes on down there
It’s like a self-help group

DAVID
Well Since you asked
(heads toward the kitchen)
there’s something we’d like to
show you

TOMMY
Oh no

MIGUEL
We walked right into it

TOMMY
NOW I get why the doors are locked
We have to convert This is a
conversion thing

GINA
Oh my god This is the real reason
you invited us here

Laughter Will sees a private look between Ben and Tommy--
they seem amused eager to see where this goes

EDEN
I know I know It sounds strange
But it’s pretty amazing

David returns with a laptop sets it down in front of them

DAVID
Just indulge us

CLAIRE
Is this some kind of recruitment
video I don’t want to

BEN
I do Convert me I’m weak

DAVID
It’s nothing like that I promise
171

172

Will looks at Eden as if to question her about all of this
She just smiles

GINA
All right let’s do this thing

They gather around the laptop David starts the video

As it starts we move across the gathered faces of the guests

ON THE LAPTOP 171

The video seems to be professionally produced assured A
voice over shots of a tranquil spa-like campus

JOSEPH (VO)
This is our home in Baja Mexico
And it is your home too if you
choose it to be Our home and our
family is open to anyone with the
desire to help themselves

DOCTOR JOSEPH an almost saintly-looking man in his late
forties gives a talk in an attractive setting to an unseen
audience

JOSEPH
The human brain has a remarkable
ability to heal My life’s work has
been to discover how to rewire to
rewrite our responses to trauma To
create new ways to understand our
experience and build new pathways
around pain We invite you to a
conscious existence A connected
existence Trauma visits all of us
We take this journey all journeys
side by side You are not alone
Wherever you are whatever you
feel We are together We
transcend

The video cuts to a shot of a SIMPLE ELEGANT CABIN Inside 172
are a dozen or so people

Joseph kneels next to a young woman ANNIE who is lying on a
cot She looks only semi-conscious Her breathing is
labored choppy

She is gaunt and sickly her body a map of a long battle with
illness
JOSEPH
How do you feel Annie

She smiles weakly

ANNIE
I feel loved

WORDS OF SUPPORT from the crowd Joseph nods
JOSEPH
Yes Do you hear that You are
loved You are felt and you are
deeply loved You are not alone

ANNIE
Mmmmm

JOSEPH
Who are you going to see dear

Her eyes flutter A delirious grin

ANNIE
My husband James My father

People in the crowd softly chime in with other names--
A reverent overlapping chorus of lost loved ones
JOSEPH
That’s right We’re all one All of
them will be there
173 IN THE ROOM
Will looks at Eden She turns to meet his eyes
174 ON THE VIDEO

We have moved back off the crowd to focus on Annie

ANNIE
Oh I I

JOSEPH
Soon Annie Soon
(strokes her hair)
Over soon All of this pain all
this grief you’ve chosen you’ve
renounced it haven’t you

ANNIE
Mmmm

173

174
175

176

JOSEPH
It is your choice You have said no
to the grief no to the depression
and sickness no to the
debilitation and fear

FOLLOWER
Amen We love you Annie

JOSEPH
It is artificial and it is
temporary We create it for

ourselves and we can abandon it at
will Our spirits are what’s real

Shouts of support
JOSEPH
They do not die No darkness no
pain just reunion

He turns to Annie stroking her forehead comforting her

JOSEPH
Youre ready aren’t you honey

ANNIE
Hnhh

Her breathing becomes even more shallow and spastic She’s
getting worse by the second

DOCTOR
-any moment now They’re right
there all there with you
IN THE LIVING ROOM 175

Will is having a hard time watching this He registers the
faces of his friends some look disturbed others fascinated

Sadie leans forward like an entranced child Pruitt shakes
his head deep in thought

ON THE SCREEN 176

Annie’s head rolls back Her eyes flicker Doctor Joseph
motions a WOMAN forward

JOSEPH
Come

He pulls her close to Annie

JOSEPH
Breathe in Breathe deep Feel her
spirit It’s real It’s a physical
thing

The woman inhales deeply from Annie’s labored breath A
blissed out smile

FOLLOWER
I can feel it
The Doctor strokes Annie’s head her breath slowing now
slowing more and more a tiny groan

And then silence She’s gone Keeping his hand on her
forehead he leans in and kisses her on the lips

JOSEPH
She’s still with us
(looking around)
And with your father and your
wife and your son

A long silence The Doctor looks around at his many
followers nodding letting them drink this in

Sobs Someone crying

JOSEPH
No Do not cry Don’t
(gently)

Celebrate She’s safe

177 IN THE LIVING ROOM 177

Stunned silence The guests look at each other David quietly
gets up and shuts off the television

He has tears in his eyes as he turns around

DAVID
This is what it’s about

BEN
Fuuuck

GINA
We did NOT just watch somebody die

BEN
That was real

EDEN
Of course it was

GINA
Why would anyone want to watch
that

EDEN

She wanted to show everyone there’s
nothing to be afraid of That’s the
point She was very sick

KIRA
With what She barely looked
thirty
EDEN
Cancer
BEN
Look I get it if you gotta go

at 30 it’s not a bad way
Surrounded by people who love you

GINA
On video Jesus

SADIE
It’s beautiful

MIGUEL
She looked at peace to me I’m not
judging her

GINA
No one’s judging her

Will finally speaks

WILL
I just don’t understand why youd
show something like this at a
dinner party

Silence David looks at Will a curious disappointment on his
face He briskly turns off the player

DAVID
Maybe this isn’t being taken the
way we meant it

KIRA
It’s a pretty heavy thing to drop
on us David
EDEN
That’s the thing For us it isn’t

PRUITT
It’s okay Most people don’t get
it The point isn’t that she died
it’s about communion

DAVID
She chose to show us that there’s
nothing to be afraid of and we can
choose joy because we’ll see her
again All we’re trying to show you
guys is that there’s another way to
look at this That

He takes a breath

DAVID
My pain had turned me into a
walking cliche I was a coked-up
out of control record producer for
god’s sake I was a slave to my own
grief Doctor Joseph freed me from
that He’s showed me that life
should be a celebration

CLAIRE
That’s hard to see in what you
showed us

DAVID

The Invitation is really just about
free will We can choose to be
happy in this life We can choose
to shape it on our own terms

PRUITT
Amen brother

DAVID

We’ve all been through horrible
things but those things don’t have
to define us We can choose how to
feel

(pause careful)
Look what happened to Eden and
Will is

WILL
Don’t Just don’t

EDEN
Finding this saved my life

178

She looks at Will She maintains eye contact with him as she
speaks

EDEN
I almost died After I almost
couldn’t keep living You know
that Will But now I’m great
(pause)
I’m not angry anymore I can
breathe I have hope And if anyone
wants to take that away from me
look at how you’re all looking at
me if anyone wants to tell me
that’s not okay Will

WILL
I know

DAVID
We’re all lost We can agree on
that right But we have each
other

David stands up eyes wet

DAVID
It’s all just too big too big for
any of us alone

He trails off Ben starts to speak but chooses instead to
drain his glass

No one says anything There is a long and silent moment
stretching on

THE DOORBELL RINGS

The sound startles people The spell is broken As David
finally moves toward the door the bell rings again

DAVID
Well

David heads to the door

GINA
That better be Choi

WILL
Yeah

178

GINA
He’s just a complete space cadet
Which is what I’ve always liked
about him in a way

Will listens nodding but is obviously distracted--

WILL’S POV

We creep slowly toward the door David has opened it only a
foot or so He talks to people we can’t see Gina’s voice
quietly continues now indistinct

GINA (0S)
-- but really I wanted to say
I guess I felt like you knew you

knew right And I wanted to give
you space but I don’t know if

From this distance it’s hard to make out what the people at
the door are saying We can only hear mumbling Will can’t
see the people outside

NEAR WILL

We realize that Gina has been talking the whole time Will is
just watching the door

GINA
- which is why I’m saying sorry
we haven’t been around so much

WILL
It’s all right

GINA
We just have to make a better
effort That’s on us I’m just not
good at this

IN THE FOYER David glances back into the house then closes
the door Faint laughter can be heard outside for a moment

ON WILL

Will looks down His FIST IS CLENCHED He is just now
noticing it It happened unconsciously

GINA
You haven’t heard a word I said
have you
179

WILL
Sorry I

David coming back toward them catches Will’s eye

DAVID
Couple people looking for a party
On foot

GINA
Good luck They’1ll die of
dehydration

David moves on looking back at Will again A curious look

GINA
We can talk later Will I just
wanted you to know I’ve been
thinking about you

WILL
Thanks I know I miss you

She heads back into the party

For a moment Will watches Kira across the room as she
laughs at someone’s joke

Miguel breezes by behind him carrying a plate of appetizers
over to the table Miguel gestures to the door with his

head

MIGUEL
No Choi

WILL
Nope

Will thinks for a second He pulls Miguel down to his level
producing the pill he took from Eden’s bedroom

WILL
Hey Miguel Can you tell what this
is

MIGUEL
It is a pill Will

WILL
Seriously I found a bunch of it in
Eden’s bedroom unlabeled

MIGUEL

Will

179
WILL
Come on just look at it

MIGUEL
(sighs)
This is crazy

He looks at the pill the markings

MIGUEL
Phenobarbital I think

WILL
Is that dangerous

MIGUEL
Anything’s dangerous if you take
too much It’s a barbiturate They
use them for seizures anxiety
insomnia sometimes I mean
there’s better stuff now but it’s
not so unusual to find it if
youre rifling through someones
medicine cabinet

A voice

TOMMY (0OS)
Break up your little clique and
come talk to us

1710 They get up and walk across the room to where Tommy is
speaking with David and Pruitt

WILL
(under his breath)
Let’s just drop it

MIGUEL
Okay snoopy

1710

Miguel slides his arm around Tommy Will nods to the group

DAVID
What’s happening boys

WILL
Not much new to report

MIGUEL
Will thinks you guys are on pills

Will shoots him a look A pause Miguel waves his hand
dismissively

around
MIGUEL
Figuratively

A pause Pruitt looks at David gestures to the bar

PRUITT
You’re out of soda here

Pruitt heads to the kitchen

WILL
I just meant that

DAVID
You think we’re crazy

WILL
No Not at all
(to Miguel)
Why
Miguel shrugs
MIGUEL

No comprendo ingles

DAVID
It’s okay I’m not offended A lot
of people think we’re crazy
(he smiles)
I doubt they’re as happy as we are

He shows his empty glass and heads to the kitchen

WILL
Thank you

MIGUEL
De nada

WILL
Am I alone here This is odd isn’t
it

TOMMY

There’s no way tonight wasn’t going
to feel a little strange Or sad
Or

(he trails off)
It’s just an overdue reunion of old
friends along with a couple of
totally random weirdos

MIGUEL
They are a little Mansony

TOMMY
Mansonian

MIGUEL
The skinny girl she seems just
so what is it

TOMMY
Oft-molested

WILL
I’m not kidding

From his vantage point he can see David talking to Pruitt in
the kitchen It’s hard to tell if the conversation is heated
or just animated

Tommy puts his arm around Will’s shoulder

TOMMY
Will listen They’re definitely
weird but come on this is LA
They’re harmless

WILL
They don’t seem right to me

MIGUEL
Please Everybodys just trying to
get by Give them a break Let’s go
steal some more of their wine

TOMMY
That I can get behind

1711 David comes back out of the kitchen and gets everyone’s 1711
attention

DAVID
Hey guys Listen I’m aware that
you might have found the video
difficult or off-putting and I
apologize

Gina calls out

GINA
It’s cool

DAVID
The last thing I want you guys to
think is that I’m trying to force
my ideas on you It’s just I want
you to know me
(pause)
So look I had an idea

He looks around

DAVID
There was a game we played in
Mexico at the end of group
I think we should try it

SADIE
Oh yeah

CLAIRE
What kind of game are we talking
about

KIRA

Like charades or something

DAVID
(smiling)
It’s actually kind of fun And
it’ll give you more of a sense of
what we learned

TOMMY
Cult alert

Eden wags a finger at him Tommy shrugs

DAVID
It’1ll be fun

GINA
I’m in What is it

DAVID
It’s kind of like that game we
played in college “I never”

This gets a big reaction from the group Cheers whistles

groans

BEN
I always lose that one

GINA
(provocative)
I never do

DAVID
Except this time it’s “I want”
We take turns and everybody says
what they want

TOMMY
I want to hear what Gina did in
college

MIGUEL

You mean who she did

DAVID
The point is to be honest to admit
our desires Because anything is
possible once we strip away
embarrassment the social
constraints the negative
emotions the things that control
us

Ben glances at Will rolling his eyes David notices this
but if he’s irked he doesn’t show it

DAVID
That’s what this game is about
Honesty Okay Everybody have a
seat

Ben shrugs his shoulders and sits right down Slowly the
others follow taking seats in a ragged circle on chairs
the couch the floor

SADIE
Ill go first

DAVID
Wonderful

Sadie stands up takes a breath

SADIE
Okay I want

She smiles at all the faces watching her
SADIE

To tell you Eden and David and
Will and Kira and Miguel

Laughter as she tries to get through them all

BEN
Pack a lunch

SADIE

(laughing with them)

and Tommy There’s so many
Ben Pruitt I want to tell you
all that I love you

(pause)
I haven’t known most of you for
that long but right now tonight
I feel love I do And most people
don’t say that They’re afraid

(pause)
So I love you

Sadie looks around at everyone taking them in Quickly she
leans down and kisses the person nearest to her Gina

GINA
Wow Hi there Ahem
(turning to the room)
I want

She lets it settle

GINA
some of that coke you used to
do
DAVID
Done

He walks behind the bar

DAVID
I think I still have some

BEN
You keep it in the house You’re
the worst rehabber in the world

GINA
No David Don’t I was kidding

DAVID
(smiling)
No you weren’t But that’s okay
That’s what the game is about

A long pause

GINA
Okay I wasn’t kidding
(over laughter)
Bust that shit out

David tosses her a baggie full of coke

TOMMY
I like this game
1712 As Gina starts to cut the cocaine Pruitt stands 1712
PRUITT

I want to tell you about my
wife Margaret We were married 8
years would’ve been 15 next month
She was a painter Oils I first
saw her work at this artists’
retreat in Minneapolis I was in
love with her before I met her
These abstract energetic
landscapes And then I saw her
(laughing)
It was like I hit the jackpot Wow
She had the most generous spirit
Id ever seen And she was just as
bright and gorgeous as the
morning

GINA
That’s so sweet

PRUITT

When you’d really surprise her she
had this laugh this joyous
gutteral rumble that came from way
down deep You knew you had done
something good

(pause)
She was all light

He looks to Eden to Sadie A sad smile
PRUITT

During times like this nights like
this night I think of her quite a

bit
MIGUEL
(tentative)
Did she pass away
PRUITT

Yes She did

Pruitt considers this for a long moment as if deciding how
to respond Finally Pruitt takes a long breath

A pause

PRUITT
We had been drinking I had been
drinking We had just come home
from a dinner We were in the
kitchen and we fell into one of
our arguments One of those stupid
little fights that last your whole
marriage I think it was about
the dishes

PRUITT
One of us started yelling I don’t
remember who I tried to pour
myself another drink She reached

over to stop me and something
just gave

(pause)
I turned and hit her as hard as I
could

Silence No one can speak Pruitt speaks quietly very
carefully There are tears in his eyes

PRUITT
Her knees gave and she hit her
head I think she was trying to get
back up You know she had her hand
out and she was staring up at
me but then she just collapsed
And then she was gone

GINA
Jesus Christ You killed your wife

BEN
What the fuck

PRUITT
It’s important that you know this
That you know how I was saved How
far I’ve come with the Invitation

CLAIRE
What are we supposed to say to
that

PRUITT

Nothing I made a terrible
terrible mistake
(MORE)
PRUITT (CONTD)

It was 7 years ago I went to
prison I paid that way But I was
still the same person I have spent
all of this time addressing that
rage That nameless thing Changing
it And finally through accepting
the Invitation and looking only
ahead destroying that horrible
part of me that led to that moment
I’m cured

(pause)
I miss her Not a day goes by that
I don’t think of her

(pause)
But I don’t grieve And I don’t
feel guilty anymore I’ve chosen to
let it go those emotions are
useless Because I know I’1l be
seeing her again soon That’s my
point

BEN
What In heaven

PRUITT
In a better place than this That’s
what we believe That’s what most
people have believed for centuries
I can’t wait to get there

He looks around at the others

Ben leans

PRUITT
Forgiveness doesn’t have to wait
I’m free to forgive myself And so
are you It’s a beautiful thing It
truly is

toward the table

BEN
Give me some of that coke

KIRA
I’m sorry but that’s just

CLAIRE
That’s just really disturbing

KIRA
I don’t know what it is

PRUITT
I didn’t mean to offend I want to
be honest because I want you to
know me I want you to see who I
am and that means you need to know
who I was

David lays a hand on Pruitt whispers something to him Then
he turns to the group

DAVID
What’s more honorable Facing the
truth or hiding it to be accepted
People change

CLAIRE
I don’t know This doesn’t seem
honest at all It feels like you’re
selling us something

DAVID
We aren’t
1713 Eden tries to save the moment 1713
EDEN
I want
CLAIRE
Are we really going to keep doing
this
EDEN
I want
GINA

This better be good

EDEN
to kiss Ben
(looking at him)
I always have

Ben laughs He looks to David who seems thrilled with the
idea

BEN
Why the hell not

Ben stands beckons Eden toward him

BEN
Bring it sister

Gina whistles Eden smiles and approaches Ben

MIGUEL
I want to kiss him
BEN
Sorry one per party
MIGUEL
It’s alright I know where you

live

Eden leans in Ben meets her with a quick friendly kiss As
he pulls back--

EDEN
No

She puts a hand on the back of his neck and pulls him in for
a long deep kiss

ON WILL as he watches this trying to understand

Slowly she ends it pulling away softly

EDEN
There
KIRA
Jeez
BEN
I don’t know if I approved that
TOMMY
Okay I want a blow job From
somebody
Laughter
TOMMY

I’m not joking
Claire stands up interrupting She looks uncomfortable

CLAIRE
I have to go

DAVID
Claire don’t It’s all right
We’re just having fun

CLAIRE
This is all is making me a
little uncomfortable I’m sorry

DAVID
Just have a seat let me get you a
drink we’ll do something else

CLAIRE
No I don’t want to spoil anyone’s
fun This just isn’t my thing

DAVID
Claire please

Will stands

WILL
Just let her go David Why can’t
she just leave

David looks at him strangely a little surprised by Will’s
tone

DAVID
Will I just want her to stay and
have a good time Eden has planned
this for a long time and it would
just be really disappointing if

WILL
Just let her do what she wants

CLAIRE
I’m going to leave

She now seems genuinely upset

A long moment David smiles at her a glimpse of something
his mind working He takes her by the shoulders

DAVID
Of course It’s all right I’m
sorry you were made to feel
uncomfortable

CLAIRE
It’s okay I’m tired

David nods reaches into his pocket He looks directly at
Will holding out the keys

DAVID
You want to do the honors

Someone laughs

WILL
I’m good

As David goes to the door unlocking it Claire hugs Eden

EDEN
Are you sure Why don’t you just
CLAIRE
Ill see you soon okay I’m really
sorry
EDEN

Okay Claire Goodbye goodbye
Eden seems reluctant to let go

DAVID
Okay Eden

Claire breaks away and goes to Will hugging him

WILL
You want me to walk you out

CLAIRE
It’s like forty feet Will

Back with the others Pruitt remembers something snapping
his fingers

PRUITT

Oh shit Are you in the Prius
CLAIRE

Yeah
PRUITT

I’m parked behind you I’1l have to
move the car

He gets up and makes his way to the door joining David
there Claire picks up her jacket and waves goodbye Pruitt
trailing behind her out the door

DAVID
So Who needs a drink

TOMMY
Tommy does

Kira sees Will going to the window
1714

1715

1716

1717

KIRA
Hey Will come over here and talk
to me

WILL

Ill be there in one second
Will stays at the window watching He sees the headlights
bob as Pruitt pulls his car out and backs it up the street
just out of sight

Conversation continues behind him but Will stays at the
window doesn’t move

DAVID (0S)
Will

Claire’s car backs out and slowly starts down the street
Will lets out his breath quietly

DAVID (0S)
will

And then her BRAKE LIGHTS GO ON The car stops just out of
Will’s sight the rest of the car obscured behind foliage

Pruitt jogs after her Waving
THROUGH THE WINDOW

Will cranes his neck trying to see better

Pruitt leans casually into the driver’s side of the Claire’s

car It is very hard to see what is going on through the
foliage just Pruitt’s legs one arm the car lights

DAVID
Will Come on

Will looks at David’s hand on the shoulder

DAVID
Can you and I talk alone for a
minute It’s important

Will looks back out the window The conversation continues
Another car passes by slowly lights moving up the street

WILL
Sure

They walk across the room away from the others David
motioning him into a chair David chooses his words
carefully

1714

1715

1716

1717
DAVID
Will I’m really happy you’re here
tonight It’s very important to
Eden and it’s important to me
too We chose you because you
matter to us

WILL
You chose us

DAVID

But you’ve been acting very
suspicious of our hospitality you
know And frankly it upsets me a
little I lock the door so we can
have some peace of mind and you
have a fit about it My friend
needs to move a car for God’s
sake and you stand at the window
like you’re going to catch him
stealing something

(pause)
You’re scaring Eden a little bit
Will You seem very distant
Very just off somehow

WILL
I’m sorry you feel that way
Maybe I wasn’t prepared to be
here

DAVID
Okay Okay I really appreciate
that honesty

David sits down in the chair next to him

DAVID
I know you must You must feel
like you have to look out I know
because that’s how I felt That the
world is unsafe and chaotic If it
happened before why shouldn’t

WILL
David please Please
(pause)
I don’t pretend to know what you
went through with your wife And
you don’t know me You can’t

David nods holding Will’s stare The keys rattle in the

front door Pruitt comes back in now wearing a jacket His

hands are in the pockets

201

PRUITT
Tried to convince Claire to stay I
felt bad about scaring her My
story She understood
He smiles at them and heads off down the hall
PRUITT
Just going to go wash up for
dinner

Will watches him go Pruitt keeps his hands in the jacket
pockets the whole time He turns the corner and is gone

EDEN (0S)
Everyone

Will turns to see that Eden holds a beautiful silver tray
piled with perfect-looking lamb

A feast

EDEN
Dinner is served

We close in on Will and we begin a
MONTAGE
ON THE STAIRS DINING ROOM

The guests move up the stairs to the dining room where a
beautifully set table awaits

IN THE HALLWAY

We creep through a darkened part of the house inexorably
Voices are audible ahead We are peering into rooms into
half-opened doors drifting moving on toward the light and
sound

IN THE DINING ROOM

We watch from above the conversations in the warm pool of
light of the dinner table

A droning sound insistent begins
AT THE TABLE

We wash in and out of conversations Food is passed back and
forth laughter

TOMMY
guins are overrated animals

GINA
(laughing)
rrated

TOMMY

Yeah I think they’re cocky
Everyone thinks they’re just
adorable and they

Oh

MIGUEL
god

TOMMY

They just know it They’re haughty

BEN

They do kind of lord it over you

Will laughs
connect but a step behind We are deeply in his point of

view

There
meat

There
seams

There

is some

too but is having a hard time Trying to

thing about the way people are tearing at their

something primal

is some

thing mechanical about the conversations the

and gaps revealed

is some

thing grotesque about all of it

Will looks across to Ben watches as laughing he tips back
him wine glass raising his eyebrows

A FLASH 202
Remembering the same gesture Ben lighter younger So much

has changed

AT THE TABLE 203

We wash back into another conversation

TOMMY

I think generally it’s pretty
simple how to act in this life Do
unto others

DAVID
(smiling)

I think we can agree to that
204

205

206

207

208

EDEN
But there are absolutes There are
thing that are true that just
are And people need guidance I
know it isn’t a popular thing to
say but it’s true They do

BEN
I love to be told what to do I
like the clarity

MIGUEL
You and Amanda are meant for each
other

KIRA

I just don’t think we get to decide
for anybody else

Will looks to Kira the way she moves her hands

A FLASH - THE PAST - SOMEWHERE ELSE

The same gesture She looks at him expectant open
AT THE TABLE

Her expression very different Darker

IN THE HALLWAY

We move closer and closer to the sounds of the conversation
We creep toward it like an animal curious but wary
approaching a campfire

AT THE TABLE

Will sees Gina looking at the empty seat where Choi should
be

KIRA
Look I’ve had a lifetime’s worth
of people telling me what to think
and do I’m not in the Air Force
anymore

We close in on Will’s face
A SHOT OF THE BACKYARD
In the daytime a childs birthday party Adults talking Ty

his son and another boy a little bit older are playing
roughhousing a little bit

AT THE TABLE
The droning sound is louder and louder

The people around him seemingly slower and faster all at
once He looks to Kira-- the only one who seems real

She is not looking at him He watches her He says her name
She doesn’t hear him doesn’t look over at him She looks
closed to him Like a person he doesn’t know

THE BACKYARD

Will runs Pushing through people

Eden is on her knees in front of them She screams

AT THE TABLE

Will’s face The sound of the conversation rises into a
cacophony

CUT TO

SILENCE

Will stands on the upstairs patio as if startled to be
there He looks back-- people are clearing plates from the
table

Off to himself he rubs his palms into his eyes trying to
get himself back together He goes inside

INT HALLWAY

Will hears something Water running in the bathroom He is
drawn toward the sound

Will stands a few steps away from the bathroom The door is
open a crack Through it he can see Sadie standing in front
of the mirror leaning forward

He can’t quite make out what she is doing He moves a little
closer

Sadie is making faces at herself in the mirror Horrible
twisted expressions eyes and mouth wide open screaming
without sound She stops Looks at her reflection Makes
another face A sort of game

Will watches fascinated disturbed Finally he turns
away just as she turns slowly to see him

209

2010

2011

Will walks away Behind him we see Sadie staring at him

She follows him

EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT 23

Will comes out onto the patio looking out He pulls out his
phone watches its display for a moment moves it around
Still no service

Behind him Sadie steps out onto the deck
SADIE
So things aren’t great with Kira
huh

He laughs surprised

WILL
I don’t why would you say that

SADIE
It just seems like that to me It
seems like she’s real distant

WILL
She’s great

Sadie nods

SADIE
Should we go back inside

She smiles enjoying whatever she’s toying with in her mind
WILL
I’m gonna try to make a call I’1l
see you in there
SADIE
Oh good luck There’s no service
up here

She moves closer to him

SADIE
I could hang with you

Abruptly she leans toward him Puts the palm of her hand on
the inside of his thigh She whispers

SADIE
You can fuck me right here

Will looks at her as if he’s unsure he’s actually heard this

WILL
What

SADIE
Nobody will care We’re not like
that It’s a gift Why should we
deny that ever Especially not
tonight

As she speaks she is absently brushing her fingertips across
the thin fabric of her skirt

SADIE
That’s the way we were in Mexico
man It was awesome People were
just going for it

WILL
I think you should go inside

She leans forward lips opening It is an electric moment
She gets close to his lips He holds her away by the
shoulders

SADIE
You don’t like me

WILL
I don’t know you

SADIE
I can make you like me so much I
can make you beg me I can do it
without even touching you Just

She leans forward toward his ear

SADIE
with my voice with my
breath
WILL
Sadie
SADIE
You can hurt me if you want
WILL

I don’t want to do that

She smiles

SADIE
I don’t believe you

She goes in He takes a breath steadying himself

EXT BACKYARD

A RUSTLING NOISE below Will looks up at the sky It is
nothing but darkness

A shape rises behind him
It’s Tommy Will surprised recoils

TOMMY
What are you doing out here

WILL
I just needed a break

TOMMY
Oh really From what

Will makes an indistinct gesture with his hand

TOMMY
Not following

WILL
Tommy there’s something wrong
here Something bad is happening

TOMMY
Will

Tommy looks at him sympathetic but firm

TOMMY

You’re wrong And I know what
youre going to say But listen--
Claire went home because the poor
girl is sexually awkward Choi
might be the most unreliable Korean
in Los Angeles He could be
anywhere Eden I haven’t seen
her in two years and that feels
crazy but I don’t know what to
Were all just trying to figure out
how to go on you know This is how
they do it

(pause)
Yeah everything is weird It’s
life

WILL
It doesn’t feel safe here

TOMMY
I know it doesn’t Look it took
a lot of courage to come here
tonight But this isn’t good for
you anymore I think you need to go
home

Will doesn’t respond

TOMMY

I’m sorry Will But enough is
enough You know very well why
things feel unsafe to you We all
do You know sometimes your mind
runs away with you Look I love
you But stop acting so fucking
weird It’s freaking people out

WILL
What do you want me to do

TOMMY

Okay Here’s what you have You’ve
got a woman in there who’s worth
it That’s why we allowed you to go
out with her You can’t put just
anyone into

(smiling indicating Will)
this She’s up to it So what
do I want I want you to start
living again

Will nods He gives Tommy a reluctant smile

WILL
Oh That’s all

TOMMY
You’re safe now

Tommy gives him a hug and walks back inside leaving Will
alone

Will takes a moment breathes

WILL
Okay

Loudly startlingly his phone CHIRPS

He looks at it-- the most tenuous of signals One new
message He presses the button

We hear the rustling sound again from below Will listens to
the message

CHOI (0S)
Will Choi What’s up Listen it’s
about 7 and I’m just pulling up to
Eden’s house I forgot to pick up
dessert like I said I would and I
can’t get ahold of Gina Could you
get some on your way I know I’m
early dude I’m actually
early but honestly I don’t want
to go back down the hill and look
for a fuckin’ patisserie Hope you
get this See you here in a few I
guess I’m going in

Will hangs up the phone He looks stunned frightened
Choi was there

Slowly Will walks back inside toward the dining room

INT DINING ROOM 25
Will enters Seeing him Gina smiles

GINA
There you are

Kira pats the seat next to her Will sits back down his mind
racing David and Eden are nowhere to be seen He looks to
Tommy trying to get his attention

Suddenly the LIGHTS in the house snap off

Darkness envelops everyone

We spend what seems to be a very long moment in the dark

Then as questions start to rise

David and Eden enter with a birthday cake complete with
candles The flickering light distorts their smiling faces

EDEN
Happy birthday Miguel

MIGUEL
It’s not for a week

EDEN
(kissing him)
It’s close enough

Miguel laughs getting into it

MIGUEL
Fine but nobody sing Please

But on Will’s face mounting panic As Miguel is about to
blow out the candles

WILL
(too loud)
Where’s Choi

EDEN
Excuse me

WILL
Where’s Choi Where the fuck is
Choi

Everyone looks at Will

GINA
What are you talking about Will

WILL
I just got a message from him He

said he was here That he got here
at seven

KIRA
What

WILL
He said he was here

David is staring at Will exchanging an anxious quick glance
with Pruitt

GINA
Eden is that true

EDEN
I haven’t seen Choi tonight

WILL
Where is he

KIRA
Will stop it Please just stop it

WILL
I got a message from him He said
he was here He was right outside
when he called

DAVID
We haven’t seen him Will

WILL
Don’t lie to me He called from
your front door

EDEN
David’s not lying Choi never got
here

BEN

Maybe he turned around

TOMMY
He couldve forgotten something

WILL
Why is everyone is being so fucking
polite Where is Choi

Now Gina is getting a bit freaked out

Silence

GINA
Eden

EDEN
We really haven’t seen him

KIRA
Sit down Will

WILL
No This isn’t right Something
very strange is going on and no one
is saying anything

PRUITT
What do you think is happening
Will

WILL
Who are you I don’t get why you’re
here

WILL

Two years We don’t see you for two
years And then suddenly you invite
us to this lavish dinner all
smiles spewing all of this
jargon

(motioning to Sadie and

Pruitt)
- with these two in tow Don’t
tell me this is normal The
Invitation

SADIE
It helps people

MIGUEL
Everyone’s allowed to have their
thing

WILL

It’s a cult Miguel A fucking
cult

(to Eden
Our son died and you’re ignoring
it You are just you’re trying
to make me ignore it too How can
you do this

KIRA
Will

WILL
Look at the video It isn’t about
communion or family It’s about
denial It’s a fucking brainwash

PRUITT
You’re out of line

WILL
It meant something when he died
Don’t erase we haven’t even said
his name tonight You’re trying to
erase him Ty was real It was
real It is real

The music continues to play into the silence an empty echo
of the good feelings of the evening now lost

WILL
Please Eden where is Choi

KIRA
She said she doesn’t know

GINA
Please stop this
David raises a calming hand
DAVID
I think this is just a big

misunderstanding

WILL
Don’t patronize me David

A long pause as the two square off

WILL

Tell me why the doors are locked
GINA

Oh God
WILL

Tell me why there are bars on the
windows Tell me why there’s a big
fucking bottle of phenobarbitol
stashed in your bedroom

BEN
Jesus Christ Will

EDEN
Did you go through our things

KIRA
I’m sorry We should go

WILL
No Something is going on
Something dangerous and we’re all
just ignoring it because David
opened some good wine

Eden pounds the table in frustration Gina is in tears Kira
gets up and heads toward Will

KIRA
We’re going We’re going now

And then there is A HARD KNOCK on the door The room goes
silent

The knocking comes again insistent

251 David calmly walks down to the door He is just out of sight 251

We hear the door open Muted voices David’s and another
person’s
Footsteps approach They all go to the railing to look down
Will follows the stares
A GASP from someone at the table
It’s CHOI

GINA
Choi

Sighs of relief Kira buries her head in her hands Ben
laughs despite himself The table looks spent harried

ON WILL

He looks confused devastated As if the known world has
collapsed for him

GINA runs to Choi’s side He is 35 fit and confident He
takes off his multicolored leather racing jacket looks for
someplace to put it and his helmet He looks chastened

CHOI
I’m so sorry I was right here and
then work called It’s so fucked
up but they can’t do anything
without me I called you

GINA
I didn’t get it

He smiles surprised at how Gina is clutching him

CHOI
You okay baby

MIGUEL
Were just glad you’re here

CHOT
(to Eden)
Did I miss dinner

BEN
You missed more than that buddy

EDEN
Weve got plenty I’ll get you
something

She heads to the kitchen Gina escorts Choi to the table
sits him next to her The few people who feel like speaking
greet Choi quietly

Eyes turn to Will

CHOI
What’s going on

Will looks mortified almost in shock He tries to say
anything

WILL
I
(looking up)
David

DAVID
It’s okay

KIRA
We really should go now

TOMMY
(under his breath)
Give him a minute

WILL
I’m fine

Eden enters with a plate of food for Choi

WILL
Eden I’m so sorry

Will is barely able to form the words

WILL
It’s very difficult for me to be
here

EDEN
I know it’s hard for me too

But you can’t criticize us for
finding our own way through this
I’ve never done that to you

WILL
Youre right It’s none of my
business
(pause)
I’m very sorry

261

EDEN
Okay

She goes over to him and kisses him

DAVID
Will You’re part of our family
(raises his glass)
All of you are

WILL
Excuse me for one second

Will leaves them The others watch him go

EDEN
Choi Eat

Choi doesn’t need to be asked twice As Will walks away
alone things for a moment are creeping back toward normal
Tommy raises a timid hand

TOMMY
Is there more wine
DAVID
I’1l open some
MIGUEL
Hallelujah
BEN
I would like a morphine drip if
possible
INT WASHROOM 26

Will enters a small powder room He seems to be on the verge
of a breakdown-- the tight space only magnifies his
breathing

The water is running in the sink He leans down splashing
handful after handful of water onto his face There’s a

violence to it

A FLASH - a smaller pair of hands held in his rubbing soap 261
together

WILL (VO)
--- keep washing ten seconds at
least

INT HALLWAY- SAME 27

Will opens the door moves into the hallway Looks down the
hall toward the light and sound of his friends talking

And quickly Kira stands up-- he hadn’t seen her sitting
back to the hallway wall They stand looking at each other
for a long moment

He goes the other way out onto the deck She follows him

EXT DECK - CONTINUOUS 28

KIRA
Let go of it We’re with our
friends We’re fine Just breathe
It’s okay

He doesn’t respond

KIRA
What’s going on What have you been
seeing
(pause)
We should go Let’s go then Let’s
just get out of here

WILL
I can’t

KIRA
What do you mean you

She shakes her head

KIRA
I don’t know how to do this You
can’t go and you can’t stay

WILL
I’m just Kira I’m not okay

He gestures to the other room trailing off

KIRA
These people care about you Will
Eden wanted you here to try to
break through to you Maybe it’s
good this has come out Maybe

WILL
It isn’t good This is not good

KIRA
You need help Will and
WILL
I’ve had help It doesn’t work
Nothing works

He looks away from her for a long moment

WILL
My son is dead Where do I put
that

KIRA

I don’t know

WILL

Neither do I There’s no way to fix
it It’s like a scream trapped
inside of me

(pause)
And there’s no changing the fact
that I wasn’t watching carefully
enough that day

She comes closer to him tentatively

KIRA
You couldn’t have known You
couldn’t be looking out for that
you just can’t expect that of
yourself What happened to your son
wasn’t anything that could be
predicted or changed or it just
happened

WILL

I can’t live with that I can’t

(pause)
Another kid I can’t even feel
Ty loved him They were just
playing Just messing around I
shouldn’t have let them have the
bat But he’s just a kid So I
can’t even I can’t

(pause)
It was just a kid

KIRA
I’m scared for you I really am I
want to help Just let me

WILL
I’ve been waiting to die since the
moment it happened

A long moment

KIRA
Moving forward isn’t a betrayal

WILL
Look at Eden That’s what letting
go looks like

KIRA
You aren’t letting him go Id
never ask you to You know that We
can help each other That’s the
only answer It’s worth living
(pause)
Please just let me help

WILL
I love you Kira But I don’t think
you can help

KIRA
That hurts so much Will Every
time you say that
(pause)
I’ve tried so hard Nothing works
but I keep trying

WILL
I’m sorry

Kira shakes her head She looks very alone

She starts to say something else but can’t put it together

She leaves gone quickly back to the others

FROM FAR AWAY 29
We see Will leaning against the railing looking out into the
night It’s quiet Only the sound of a gentle wind muted

voices of people inside

In the distance the whole of the LA basin is spread out
before him a net of lights

We notice that there’s another sound A faint rustling in the
brush far below Will doesn’t react He doesn’t seem to hear
it

WE MOVE DOWN VERY SLOWLY to reveal--

Claire

He body is twisted her face streaked with blood She lies
tangled in the brush at the corner of the house Barely
alive

Will on the deck is above her

Claire opens her mouth but she can’t make a sound All she
can manage is a twitch of her finger against the brush

Her eyes are wide with panic She is very near death
ABOVE
Will composes himself Takes a last look out

Unable to hear Claire he turns and walks back inside

INT DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 30

As Will enters the dining room Eden is cutting up the
birthday cake with a long knife She looks up at him

Only a few others meet his glance Choi is eating away
GINA
(quietly)
Hi Will

Will nods He looks ashamed

WILL
I’m so sorry

His words hang An uncomfortable pause as he looks around the
room at everyone Finally he turns to Eden

WILL
Can I look at his room

Eden glances briefly at David then nods to Will
EDEN
Of course
INT HALLWAY - DOWNSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS 31

Will walks to the door that leads to the study the room he
wouldn’t go inside Now he does

321

322

323

324

325

326

327

INT STUDY - CONTINUOUS

He locks the door behind him He sinks down against the door
sitting on the floor He closes his eyes opens them again

A flash the room as it was A childs room in the blinding
sunlight

The same POV the room as it is now A tidy well kept study
All traces of his son erased

Another flash his son sleeping

WILL
God Oh god Oh god

Flash Will looks at his sleeping child The boy opens his
eyes slowly recognizing his dad Smiling

Will puts his head in his hands
He breathes

Muffled but loud laughter can be heard from down the hall
Will looks up

And sees DAVID WALK PAST THE WINDOW across the backyard

Will gets up slowly and goes to the window craning his neck
to see into the yard

THROUGH THE WINDOW

We see that David is standing at the far end of the yard
looking out over the city He has a long match is lighting
something

It’s a decorative RED LANTERN David finishes lighting it
replaces the glass and looks at the light for a moment then
he looks out into the canyon breathing in the night air
David walks away around the other side of the house

IN THE ROOM - CLOSE ON WILL

He looks around the room Searching opening drawers His
eyes fall on David’s laptop

He opens it
He can’t stop now

ON THE SCREEN

328

329

An image of DOCTOR JOSEPH Still very good looking but it
looks like he hasn’t slept in days There’s a glass of wine
in front of him He looks very calm

IN FRONT OF THE LAPTOP
Will turns the volume down leaning forward to hear
ON THE VIDEO

Joseph begins to speak He is hypnotic He is speaking
directly to Will To us

JOSEPH
I know you have doubts Skepticism
can be contagious I wouldn’t have
known either before I saw the new
truth and I shared it with you I
would not have believed but it was
revealed so clearly Remember the
reward This beautiful moment is
upon us Tonight is the night our
faith is made real

There is a SUDDEN LOUD KNOCK on the door A voice from the
hallway

PRUITT (0S)
Hey Will You in there

But Will is transfixed by what is on the screen

JOSEPH
Remember that God is great and
that our pain will be sanctified
and that we will be made whole
again You are giving a gift Each
one you gather to us increases your
blessing They’1ll rejoice to be
with us The hardest thing is
starting Just take that step
believe and give yourself over

The knocking even louder now rattling the door Pruitt’s
voice is shedding any cover of the collegial It’s forceful

PRUITT (0S)
Will let’s go Everyone is waiting
for you

On screen Joseph raises the glass Tears stream down his
cheeks but he is smiling

328

329

JOSEPH
I love you I love you so much my
heart is breaking I can’t wait to
see you To meet our new brothers
and sisters We’1ll all be together
soon I’m waiting for you

The screen goes black The knocking is now a pounding

3210 Will is still transfixed The pounding is louder and louder 3210
and we CUT TO

33 INT HALLWAY 33
The door opens Pruitt and Will stand face to face A long

moment as they look at each other Pruitt puts a hand on his
shoulder gently but firmly

PRUITT
Okay
He walks Will back toward the dining room standing close
behind him
Will walks in front of him up the stairs Pruitt seems giant
to us
34 INT THE DINING ROOM 34

All heads turn to see Will

He takes his seat with everybody

Now that everyone is here David stands to give a toast
A piercing sound is rising

Will is struggling We focus on the drinks on the crystal
decanter filled with port on the fancy glasses in front of
them

DAVID
Everyone please take each other’s
hands

Slowly a few of them comply David raises his glass

DAVID
We all know pain Let’s transform
it into something pure and good I
wanted we wanted all of us to be
together

Eden’s hand is shaking as she pours the port

DAVID
Look around at who is with you I
am so glad to be with you all right
now To a better world to come To
peace

Back and forth between Will The drinks Their faces The
port in its decanter splashing out

They reach for their drinks We watch Will

The piercing sound rises and rises Will stands up

WILL
Don’t drink it Don’t fucking touch
it

SADIE

What are you doing

CHOI
Take it easy man

KIRA
Will That’s enough

Will is on his feet he slapping drinks out of hands Wine
spills everywhere

Pruitt is on his feet to stop him

WILL
Don’t drink it

DAVID
(quietly)
This is wrong This is wrong

Tommy gets up as well

TOMMY
Will You need to calm down

Will makes a move toward someone else but he’s grabbed by
Pruitt and held

WILL
We have to get out of here

PRUITT
Get yourself under control

Eden just looks at Will

EDEN
Will I’m sorry I know it’s hard
Please just be quiet
(to Pruitt)
Let him go Pruitt let him go

Slowly Pruitt moves away from Will

BEN
Well anybody want me to get
their coat Cause I’m yeah

WILL
(to Kira)
Let’s go

KIRA
Okay Yes

Eden just watches a hand over her mouth David takes her
other hand His intensity is strange

DAVID
Everyone sit back down and relax
Let’s just go back to where we
were Let’s just forget about this
and have a drink

A laugh escapes from someone at the table

BEN
Great party Wow

David is still staring down at the table We notice that
Sadie is glaring at Will distraught and angry

DAVID
Just take your drink and we can
move on Let’s drink together

please and it’ll be all right

WILL
Do not drink that

Sadie stands up abruptly
SADIE

You ruined it You’re fucking
ruining everything
341

342

She charges Will clawing at him wildly out of control Will
puts his arms up to defend himself They collide Will moving
out of the way lashing out at her

She loses her balance shrieking and HER HEAD SLAMS INTO A
CORNER OF THE BANQUETTE WITH A SICKENING WET CRACK

Silence

KIRA
Oh my god

Sadie is crumpled on the floor

Miguel is the first to get to her He bends over her
checking on her

A long slow moment Surreal and quiet Kira stares at Will
So does Eden

EDEN
What did you do Will

David is slowly shaking his head He meets eyes with Pruitt
Pruitt forces the shocked Will into a chair

All other eyes are on Miguel who gently handles Sadie
rolling her over We focus on his efforts Sadie’s eyes are
wide open but she is unresponsive Her mouth is silently

mouthing words Blood drips onto the floor from her temple

MIGUEL
Call 911 Right now

Ben fumbles with his phone Eden starts backing away David
stops her a hand on her arm

CLOSE ON MIGUEL as he works on Sadie

DAVID (0S)
What are we going to do

PRUITT (0S)
Just be calm

MIGUEL
Do you have a first aid kit

Miguel looks into Sadie’s eyes reaching back for a cloth
napkin to stop the bleeding

KIRA (0S)
She’s not breathing

341

342

MIGUEL
No she’s breathing She’s

KIRA (0S)
Not Sadie Gina

Miguel turns
Gina is slumped in her chair her empty glass on the floor
next to her Her eyes are wide open Choi scrambles around

the table

CHOI
Gina Baby

Miguel leaves Sadie moves over to Gina

MIGUEL
What’s going on

Everyone is stunned-- frozen or backing slowly away Kira is
the first to snap out of it She helps Miguel get Gina out of
the chair and onto the floor Miguel checks her pulse and
breathing starts CPR

CHOI
What’s happening What’s happening

WITH WILL

WILL
Gina Gina

He tries to get out of his chair but Pruitt is holding him
down

Ben behind them can’t seem to get 911 on the phone
BEN
I can’t get a signal Somebody else

try

Very quietly David starts whispering what sounds like a
prayer Pruitt joins him pressing down on Will’s shoulders

PRUITT
Oh glory to God

LOW ANGLE ON MIGUEL
Miguel starts to give Gina mouth-to-mouth He breathes into

her He starts compressions In the background Sadie squirms
on the floor starting to stir
344

345

346

347

348

The room is quiet except for the prayers

Miguel bends forward for another breath

A LOUD SHARP CRACK 344
Miguel’s body splays violently forward onto Gina

BEHIND HIM-- David clutching a snub-nosed pistol smoke
curling from the barrel

In the room shock An eerie moment of paralysis-- no one can
process what is happening Even David mouth wide open seems
shocked at what he’s done

But then he starts to turn the gun toward the others

And the room erupts

Chaos-- Will kicking himself out of the chair Choi diving 345
behind the table Pruitt shouting something strangled and
triumphant

Tommy charges at David 346
A HORRIFYING SHRIEK

Sadie blood smeared across her temple mouth an inhuman

gash meets Tommy mid-stride She has a knife from the table

She SLASHES him across the chest blood spurting out of a

deep gash

Tommy falls over a chair Sadie slips on Miguel’s blood and
clatters to the floor

Now everyone is screaming
Choi is running toward the door opposite the stairs 347

WILL
Choi No

Pruitt rushes after him David behind him knocking chairs
over

David shouts something guttural unintelligible Pruitt drags
Choi to the floor Sadie is already plunging the knife into
Gina

ON KIRA 348

Watching this in horror Her hands in front of her palms up
defensively
349

Will’s hand on her arm They meet eyes She is in shock

WILL
Kira

And they run Will pushing her in front of him stumbling
toward the stairs It’s the only place they can go

IN THE BACKGROUND 349

Pruitt knees pinning Choi to the floor takes the gun away
from David and points it at Choi’s writhing form

He FIRES

INT STAIRWELL 35

Kira races down stairs Will just behind her hand on her
back pushing her Ben is right behind them

BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS 36

Kira runs to the right Will behind her Ben bolts down the
opposite hallway toward the master bedroom

WILL
Ben Ben This way

But Ben keeps going ON KIRA AND WILL running down the
HALLWAY Her voice is a garbled cry as she tries the first
door

KIRA
It’s locked

He pulls her away and they run toward the last door at the
end of the hall past the stairs

A rush of footsteps motion from behind them-- Sadie
shrieking SLAMS INTO THEM

A mess of panicked violent motion in the cramped space of
the hallway-- Kira knocked to the ground Sadie slashing with
her knife Will trying to fend her off

Will lands a hard blow and he and Kira manage to break free
running down the hall to the door Chaos

They open it get inside Through the closing door a sliver
of Sadie running toward them

IN THE ROOM 37
371

Utter darkness

WILL (0S)
Try to find a light Kira

KIRA (0S)
--I’m trying Oh God

WILL (0S)
Kira

The sound of them fumbling for a light They are just black
shapes against a deeper blackness to us

A small light appears in Will’s hand-- his cellphone He
throws it on top of a heavy bulky shape a dresser

Groaning with the strain he pulls the dresser away from the
wall and in front of the door barricading it

A THUMP right behind him the door slamming against the
barricade An incoherent screaming guttural animal outside
the door It must be Sadie

KIRA (0S)
It’s behind something the light

Boxes are stacked to the ceiling the room packed with them
Everything from his and Ty’s old life

Sadie scratches and claws at the door A lower moaning

Kira goes to the window and breaks the glass trying to find
a release for the bars that block their exit

OUTSIDE a crashing sound of shattered glass

THROUGH THE WINDOW

We see Ben He’s thrown a chair through a locked plate glass
door Injured panicked he limps hurriedly across the

floodlit backyard

David emerges chasing after the fleeing Ben dragging him
down from behind

Instantly top of him David stabs Ben repeatedly
Pruitt appears walking quickly up to them

Ben is saying something desperate but we can’t hear what it
is

Pruitt shoots him

BACK IN THE HOUSE 372

KIRA
(muffled)
Why is this happening
Will is still looking out the window

WILL
Kira

OUTSIDE IN THE YARD 373
David and Pruitt are standing over Ben’s body
BACK IN THE HOUSE 374

Will ducks away from the window pulling Kira down with him
The next conversation is rushed jumbled

WILL
We can’t just wait here For them
to come He has a gun

KIRA
How do we get out

Will holds her head in his hands

WILL
We have to get ready We have to do
whatever it takes They are just
people

KIRA
Well fight

They look at each other for a long time Kira’s voice is
cracking

KIRA
Ill help you If

WILL
I know you will

Kira nods at Will Her fists clenched her knees shaky Will
pushes the dresser aside enough to get through the door Will
puts his hand on the door

WILL
Let me go first

He breathes in a few times They yank open the door

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 38
Sadie is gone
Will and Kira move forward trying to control their breathing
as they move toward the stairs
INT HALLWAY KITCHEN ALCOVE - CONTINUOUS 39
- voices can be heard right around the corner Will stops
Kira The two pause outside the kitchen entrance under the
stairs listening
EDEN (0S)
we were supposed to just go to

sleep and go there together

Will peers around the corner looking for the voices

INT KITCHEN 40

David holds Eden by the shoulders trying to calm her She is
frantic her entire body clenched

DAVID
It’ll be quiet in a minute We just
have to

EDEN
It wasnt supposed to be like
this

DAVID

We just have to finish It’1l be
quiet then and we can rest Just
one step at a time We have to
finish it honey we have to finish
it so we can rest

EDEN
No I can’t

DAVID
Yes you can Come help me

EDEN
No No This was wrong This

DAVID
Dr Joseph said it would be hard
But remember we’re chosen We’re
chosen for this

EDEN
This is wrong

DAVID
It’s right We are leaving here
This is how we stop hurting The
only way

EDEN
That’s not what he said He said

DAVID
He said this is the only way to be
free All this pain all this shit
stays behind here It stays behind
He calms a bit looking at her intimate
DAVID
You can do this We can still get
there
David exits the kitchen
Eden remains for a second Then she follows him

IN THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Will and Kira hide just inside the door to the kitchen as
David and Eden head toward the master bedroom

Will and Kira emerge into the hallway beneath the stairs
Will points up whispers--

WILL
There’s a door to the garage Up
there

They creep around to the base of the stairs Suddenly a
sound-- a RASPY intake of breath We move around them to

see

Sadie facing away splayed out on a chair

She is smeared in blood

Will and Kira are frozen Her head rolls to the side-- she
looks at them without seemingly recognizing them She seems
confused stunned

One hand rubs at the sticky mat of hair and blood on the back
of her head In her other limply hanging hand-- a FIREPLACE
POKER

The three just look at each other We can hear their
breathing--

-- and Will reaches over and takes the poker from her Sadie
offers no resistance just stares into his eyes

Will and Kira back away then hurry quietly upstairs

INT DINING ROOM 42
into the dining room The music is still playing Some

plates still set on the table others broken on the floor

Gina under the table Miguel face down

No sounds of anyone moving

They move through the double doors into

INT SCREENING ROOM 43
Will and Kira come into the large panelled screening room
To their left in the hallway Choi’s legs splayed out They
can’t look They continue into the room There is a door at

the back to the left of the screen They run to it

But it isn’t a door anymore It has been sealed in the
renovation and is just a faint outline

He puts his forehead against it speaks half to Kira half to
himself

WILL
Look for keys Something to open
the window Something

Kira goes to the long window high up on the wall pulling at
the bars They are solid

Right outside is the street No way to get there
431

KIRA

We could signal someone We could

try
Kira leaves the window starts desperately tearing through
the cabinets that line one wall She keeps glancing back into
the house No one is coming
Kira reaches the highest shelf There’s something there
She pulls down a box of bullets
A box of bullets but no gun

KIRA
Will

She holds the box up His eyes widen

WILL
Where is it

Will goes to her helping her look

Kira slides to another cabinet opening it She glances over
her shoulder out into the house

Now Pruitt is coming approaching through the dining room

KIRA
Will Will

Pruitt holds the gun in his hand walking toward them
unhurried

Will grabs the fireplace poker pushes Kira behind the
screening room chairs

Pruitt closes on them

Will throws the poker at Pruitt-- it hits Pruitt causing him
to drop the gun

Will charges him but Pruitt grabs Will throws him into the
wall and wrestles him into a choke hold

Kira attacks Pruitt but he bats her away She hits the
floor

Will is almost able to struggle free but Pruitt corrals him
squeezing his arm tighter around his neck He kicks the gun
out of the room In the background Kira is trying to crawl
into the dining room

431
432

PRUITT
Will let go There’s a plan for
us

Will struggles against Pruitt trying to hit out or kick him--
It’s useless

Pruitt speaks in a close feverish whisper

PRUITT
We’1ll be there soon

Will’s punches lose strength as he gasps for air

PRUITT
I promise

But Kira appears behind them She smashes a bottle of wine
into the side of Pruitt’s face

Pruitt reels back releasing Will Will falls to his knees
Pruitt falling behind him

Pruitt tries to rise His cheek has been ripped open by the
glass His nose broken shoved grotesquely to one side

Kira brings the bottle down onto Pruitt again and again until
it’s over

Finally she drops the bottle slumps over

She and Will look at each other for a long desperate moment
Grateful

They help each other toward the stairs
but Eden appears in the dining room

She seems dazed out of control

She picks up the gun

Kira sees her before Will does

KIRA
Will

Eden holds the gun out and FIRES recoiling
A pink mist of blood in the air as Will falls out of frame
IN THE DINING ROOM

Eden looks at the gun almost in surprise

432

EDEN
I’m sorry I’m sorry I’m sorry
IN THE SCREENING ROOM

Will lies on the floor holding the side of his neck near the
shoulder blood seeping through his fingers

Kira stands up hands forward Eden looks at the gun at
Will and at Kira

Kira takes a step toward her
ACROSS THE ROOM

Eden breathes in sharply It’s as though she’s waking up from
a dream

Eden points the gun into her own chest
She pulls the trigger Her body folds around the gun
Acrid blueish smoke clings to the air

KIRA (0S)
Jesus Oh Jesus Stop it Stop

Eden lies on the floor mouth and eyes wide open Thick blood
is soaking through her dress as she puts her hand on the
wound writhing in pain

IN THE DINING ROOM

Kira stands lost She blinks clearing her eyes seems to
regain herself

Kira bends over Will He looks up at her
Through his eyes everything is clear now Lucid
We slide back and forth his point of view hers

She presses her hands on top of his his blood on her hands
She speaks very close to him desperate

KIRA
I need you I need you Will We’re
not gonna die like this

He’s alive He’s breathing looking up at her

WILL
We can get through this

She nods

WILL
We’re gonna make it

A voice from somewhere in the house

DAVID (0S)
Eden

WILL
You have to get the gun

Kira scrambles toward where Eden lies toward the revolver
out into the house

FOYER KITCHEN

David moves slowly through the main part of the house past
the front door

We find Tommy hiding in the kitchen wounded He gathers
himeself in pain

David passes by the kitchen calling out again

DAVID
Eden

DINING ROOM
Will is pushing himself up now shouting

WILL
She shot herself David

The voice is close but David can’t be seen

DAVID (0S)
Good That’s good She’s with them
now

WILL

We have a gun

Kira hunched over looking out runs back to Will and past
him She falls to her knees next to the couch hands shaking
picking up the box of bullets she found

WILL
Kira

KIRA
It’s empty

451

She breaks open the cylinder
David comes into view AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS 451
He has a gun

DAVID
It’s time now It’s okay

WILL
David Don’t do it

He raises the gun as he climbs the stairs
Kira is still trying to get bullets into the cylinder

And Tommy is behind David staggering toward him wounded
something in his hand

But David has heard his gasping breaths He turns toward
Tommy

STAIRWELL BASE OF THE STAIRS 46

David cries out and collapses on top of Tommy both tumbling
down the stairs

The two roll on the ground David trying to choke Tommy
Tommy forcing his hands away

Shoes and limbs thump violently against the walls and floor
as the two of them struggle brutally

Finally the struggle stops Tommy pries himself loose David
has gone slack There is a knife in his belly

Tommy pushes himself away from the body

Silence Then Will makes his way down the stairs Goes into
David’s pockets to find-- the keys

Tommy leans against the wall

TOMMY
Who’s who’s still

KIRA (0S)
(from above)
Sadie I think

Tommy and Will can see Sadie from where they are She’s
slumped over dead

TOMMY
She’s dead

Will goes back up the stairs

DINING ROOM —- CONTINUOUS

Will goes to Eden who lies curled around herself on the
floor There is a thick smear of blood behind her She has
tried to drag herself away

Eden is lying on her back Blood covers her dress She looks
up at Will and manages an affectionate melancholy smile
It is discordant From a different time

Will bends down next to her There is a scorched wound in her
chest Nothing can be done

WILL
Eden

Eden gazes for a long moment into Will’s eyes
EDEN
I miss him Will I miss him so
much
Tears run down her cheeks
EDEN
I believed I just wanted to

believe

She’s interrupted by a horrible wet cough There’s not much
more she can manage

EDEN
I’m sorry

Will takes her hand presses it to his mouth He shakes his
head He whispers something that sounds like goodbye

EDEN
Will you take me outside

He nods carefully awkwardly trying to pick her up It is
very difficult

A LITTLE WAY AWAY
Kira watches as Will struggles to pick her up still trying

to comprehend what has happened Kira’s instinct draws her
forward She goes to Will

She helps him to carry Eden

EXT BACKYARD BELOW - MOMENTS LATER

Will and Kira carry Eden to a the yard Eden keeps her eyes
on Will’s Something innocent and overwhelmed in her eyes

They gently put her down

Eden looks up into the sky Will sinks down beside her
holding her hand

She’s in terrible pain but she seems relieved to be outside
grateful for the night air this view that will be her last

Her breathing grows labored

EDEN
I hope I hope we

She lets go of his hand turns her head to gaze out at the
city To die

Will stands

Tommy has followed them outside stands next to Kira They
raise their eyes to Will’s approach He comes to them

Silently the three hold each other for a moment

TOMMY
I have to go get Miguel

KIRA
Tommy

She goes to him putting her arms around him Tommy starting
to cry

WILL
Well meet you on the road okay

Tommy nods and walks back into the house around the corner
where one streak of glistening blood on the wall is the only
indication of what waits there

On the other side of the deck Will and Kira notice that the
red light the lantern Will saw David light is still shining
brightly undisturbed

Something draws Will to it He looks at it for a moment
moving closer

481

482

WILL
Oh my God
AS THE CAMERA RISES BEHIND THEM Kira sees it too 481

Among the lights of the houses on the hills shining
brightly

At least a dozen of the same red lanterns

They are everywhere

CLOSE ON 482
Will and Kira’s hands touching Grasping each other tightly
Sounds are now filtering up toward them Far away sirens

Visible now are lights of police cars of ambulances

flashing in all directions through the city The chopping

sounds of helicopters

WILL
Kira Stay with me

She nods

KIRA
No matter what

The wind rustles the trees Something cries out far in the
distance A man or an animal Another

Still holding hands Will and Kira stare out at the red
lanterns so many red lights

The view is still quite beautiful

CUT TO BLACK
