FADE IN

EXT HILLS OF SAN FRANCISCO - AFTERNOON

A HAPPY YOUNG COUPLE takes advantage of the sunny day to take
a walk along the tree-lined street hand-in-hand wheeling
their BABY in a stroller The picture of family bliss They
begin to cross the street barely noticing

The PRIUS out of nowhere racing down on them at 90 mph horn
BLARING The couple jumps out of the way just in time

PHIL’S VOICE (0S)
I hate it when you speed You’1l
get into an accident

INT PRIUS - SAME TIME

It’s a mess of papers and old water bottles At the wheel is
LAURIE ZELLER 34 strong no-nonsense slightly scatter-
brained workaholic She talks to her husband on BLUETOOTH

LAURIE
I’m not speeding

PHIL (0S)
I heard pedestrians screaming

LAURIE
They weren’t screaming They
were cheering for me

PHIL (0S)
Baby let’s just do it tonight

LAURIE
No I’m working late tonight and I
have a full hour for lunch today
so take off your pants cause I’m
gonna rock your world

PHIL (0S)
(a little sexy)
Oh yeah What are you gonna do

LAURIE
Well first I’m gonna--

IN HER REARVIEW MIRROR - Laurie sees a police car sirens on

LAURIE (CONT’D)
Um hold please
EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER

The POLICEMAN approaches the car leans into Laurie’s open
window Laurie thrusts out her hand sighs

LAURIE
Just give it to me

PHIL (0S)
Oh I’m gonna give it to you so hard-

Laurie quickly turns off speakerphone

POLICEMAN
I’m gonna need your license and
registration and I’m gonna need
you to step out of the vehicle

LAURIE
(changing tactics - sweet)
Oh no really ‘Cause you could
also just give me the ticket and
let me go I wouldn’t ask but
it’s super important --

POLICEMAN
Catching a flight Late for a big
work meeting I’ve pretty much
heard it all

LAURIE
I’m ovulating

POLICEMAN
License and registration

LAURIE
Today The egg is literally
dropping right now my vaginal
mucus is at an all time thin and
this cervix is falling-off-the vine
RIPE And I am on the wrong side
of thirty here so I’m sure as hell
not gonna waste what could be my
LAST egg getting a speeding ticket
from some uptight glorified meter
maid So here’s what’s going to
happen Officer - I’m gonna go home
now and have sex with my husband
If you want to call your deputy and
get all your little soldiers out
here to chase me go right ahead
But I am not coming in without a
fight

(MORE )
LAURIE (CONTD)
Either I’1l make it home to my
husband or you’ll have to explain
to your captain why you were on the
six o’clock news dragging a poor
crying woman who only wanted a baby
down to the slammer Either way
one of us is getting fucked today

off the stunned Policeman

CUT TO

EXT ZELLER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Laurie’s Prius SQUEALS into the driveway and screeches to a
halt Laurie flies out of the car and runs into the house
unbuttoning her pants and pulling off her shirt as she runs

INT ZELLER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Laurie bursts in dropping clothes on the floor of the
otherwise immaculate house as she goes The Zellers’ two
ferocious looking PIT BULLS greet Laurie happily

LAURIE
Hi sweeties hi little girls
(then calling upstairs)
I’M HOME

PHIL (0S)
Up here

Laurie bounds up the stairs and into the bedroom a romantic
scene of lit candles and champagne on ice Her husband PHIL
ZELLER lies naked on the bed Phil’s 36 although he’s the
type of uptight guy who’s been an adult since birth

PHIL (CONTD)
I tried to set the mood

LAURIE
Aw baby that’s so sweet

Laurie quickly blows out the candles takes a giant swig of
champagne straight out of the bottle and leaps onto Phil

LAURIE (CONTD)
I have six minutes lLet’s do this
thing

AS WE MOVE away from Laurie and Phil past a HAPPY WEDDING

soon as Phil finishes Laurie lies back holding her legs up
INT SUPERMARKET - DAY

Laurie swipes a giant armful of pregnancy tests into a cart

INT ZELLER HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Phil and Laurie have more sex this time with Laurie hanging
over the bed upside down

INT ZELLER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

Laurie sits on the toilet pants around her ankles and Phil
leans over her as they excitedly wait for the results of a
pregnancy test holding hands in anticipation Her

expression shows it’s negative She chucks it in the trash

EXT ZELLER HOUSE - DAY

Phil pulls up in his car He runs inside We slowly pan
360° around to see the rest of the quiet neighborhood By
the time we get back to the front door Laurie is running out
the door fumbling to button her shirt

INT ZELLER HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

More negative pregnancy stick hit the wastebasket which is
beginning to fill up

INT ZELLER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Phil runs into the kitchen in his bathrobe He dumps an
“Ensure” nutrition shake and a Red Bull into a blender then

gulps it down thirstily as Laurie runs in in her bathrobe and
drags him back to the bedroom
INT ZELLER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Start on a book - “YOU’RE NOT CONCEIVING NOW WHAT” Pull
back to reveal Laurie’s reading it intently highlighting
large portions a look of grim determination on her face
Pull back further to reveal Phil fucking her from behind a
look of grim determination on his face She turns the page

Another negative pregnancy test hits the overflowing trash

END OF MONTAGE

INT OBGYN EXAM ROOM - DAY

Laurie sits on the exam table in a gown Phil sits nearby
The kindly old fashioned but potty-mouthed OBGYN looks over
Laurie’s labs

OBGYN
Thyroid’s fine no pituitary
problems testosterone’s good
Fuck if I know there’s no reason
why you shouldn’t be conceiving

Laurie and Phil look disappointed A beat then --

LAURIE
Okay what about IVF Or
artificial insemination

PHIL
Hormone shots Clomid for her
gonadotropin for me

LAURIE
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection

PHIL

Zygote intrafallopian transfer -
OBGYN

Whoa whoa -- let’s slow this shit

down Come on guys Are we
making babies here or cyborgs

Phil and Laurie look at him blankly Then
PHIL
Intrauterine subcutaneous hyper-
stimulation vitrification --

OBGYN
You ever play Space Invaders

PHIL
Space Invaders

OBGYN
Yeah you know little ship - you
move left right shoot the aliens
Her eggs are the aliens and your
dick is the spaceship It’s easy
to hit ‘em at first when you’re
young cause there’s aliens
everywhere But then you get
older Which for Laurie means

PHIL
Diminished ovarian reserve

OBGYN
Fewer invaders exactly And
theyre not those nice fat bitches
at the bottom anymore theyre the
tiny little evil jellyfish
motherfuckers from the top and
they’re moving fast

Laurie and Phil exchange an alarmed look

OBGYN (CONTD)
So now you’re getting nervous about
how you cant hit them like you
used to your bodies start making
mistakes which makes them even
harder to hit so you get more
nervous and pretty soon Game
over

Laurie and Phil take this in

OBGYN (CONTD)
Look you guys don’t need any hi-
tech fancy procedure shit yet you
just need to stop worrying about
it Stressing about conceiving
stops you from conceiving

LAURIE
So we should just
OBGYN
Chill the fuck out And keep
playing

The OB winks and leaves Laurie and Phil look at each other
smile Then Phil unbuckles his pants and Laurie puts her
feet in the stirrups As they start to do it on the exam
table giggling

INTERCUT WITH
INT NICE HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Laurie wearing a headset sits with several other people in
this bedroom which has been outfitted as a makeshift control
room She watches the scene play out on hidden cameras on a
series of monitors We realize that she’s the producer of
this To Catch a Predator-like show

LAURIE
(to Gaius over headset)

racy things in your web chat You
wrote “I want to suck the tips of
your nips LOL

GAIUS (CONTD)
BIW I’m not that big down there but
I got huge balls” And you attached
some very graphic photos

Ron and Laurie barely pay attention as he goes on and on

LAURIE

early for my birthday dinner

RON
Oooh slacker Working less than a
17 hour day

supportive of my career even since
the day we met I smashed up his
fender in the Starbucks parking lot-

INT MEDICAL PRACTICE - PHIL’S OFFICE - DAY

A sterile meticulously neat doctor’s office The walls are
bare except for Phil’s UCSF MEDICAL DEGREE and a depressing
Edward Hopper painting Two magazines with alarmist front
pages like “SUPER GERMS - THE NEXT THREAT TO THE HUMAN RACE”
are arranged perfectly on a coffee table A solemn Phil in
a WHITE COAT sits at his desk facing a PATIENT WE CAN’T SEE

PHIL
Look I think you’re gonna be fine
but I don’t believe in sugarcoating
things There can always be
complications rheumatic fever
kidney inflammation heart damage
coma even death Is there anyone
youd like me to talk to

REVEAL Phil’s talking to a terrified TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY on the
verge of tears Phil shifts uncomfortably

PHIL (CONT’D)

The boy nods tears beginning to fall

PHIL (CONTD)
Okay okay I’1l talk to your
parents Look strep throat isn’t

success treating it sooh boy

The boy is sobbing outright now Phil has no idea how to
handle it He pushes a box of tissues across the desk

INT MEDICAL PRACTICE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Phil’s door opens and the boy runs out past Phil’s longtime
RECEPTIONIST into the waiting room

LITTLE BOY
(crying)
Mommmmmyyyyyy----

Phil follows The receptionist gives him a look

RECEPTIONIST
A lollipop and a funny face go a
long way you know

PHIL
I’m a doctor not a clown When

act like idiots

RECEPTIONIST
Uh-huh You and Laurie still
trying for one of your own

PHIL
Yeah it’s taking longer than we
planned

(MORE)

PHIL (CONTD)
Which is hard when you feel like
you have so much love to give a
child you know

The Receptionist bites her tongue Phil notices a DEAD
POTTED PLANT on the desk He picks it up

PHIL (CONTD)

You need to be a damned
horticulturist to keep these exotic
plants alive

RECEPTIONIST
That was a house fern

Phil throws the plant into the trash heads through the door
to the waiting room
INT MEDICAL PRACTICE - WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

PHIL

Phil As a few begin to openly SOB

INT NICE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
Gaius is wrapping up Gene looks ashamed

GAIUS
Well this may not be the blow you
came for but I’m about to blow your
mind cause I’m Gaius Withers and
youre on “Catch That Perv”

Several CAMERAMEN with handheld cameras move in

GENE
I know I watch the show There’s
cops outside right

GAIUS
(a beat then)
When you say you watch the show
you mean you’ll watch if it happens
to be on or it’s more appointment
viewing Tivo Season Pass type
thing

BACK ON Laurie and Ron roll their eyes as Gaius sits at the
bar and pours lemonade for Gene

LAURIE
Gaius come on kick him out
already

GAIUS

Let’s say I were hosting a series
of hidden camera shows covering
everything from elder abuse to
political corruption on a state
level is that something you would
be Strongly Likely Likely or Not
At All Likely to watch

GENE
I don’t know I don’t watch that
much TV I’m mostly on my computer

Gaius takes away the lemonade

GAIUS
I think you should go now

EXT NICE HOUSE - DAY

Gaius wraps up the show outside the house Laurie stands
beside the cameraman taping him In the BG WE SEE GENE
BEING HANDCUFFED NEXT TO A SQUAD CAR

GAIUS
Once again we have exposed the
dark underbelly of the internet
Behind every innocent message
board in every web chat room or
celebrity blog there is a pervert
waiting to diddle your child Im
Gaius Withers warning you to love
your children or someone else
will God speed and good night

LAURIE
And cu--

Gaius solemnly holds out one finger to give him a moment of
reflection Then nods Laurie sighs

LAURIE (CONT’D)
Cut

GAIUS
That went pretty well I think

LAURIE
Yeah Maybe don’t pitch the new
show to the perverts

GAIUS
Do you know what networks call sex
predators Viewers
(changing subject)
So do you have birthday plans

LAURIE
Our families are coming to the
house for dinner A whole evening
of “Why aren’t you pregnant”
“This is how I got pregnant”
“Here’s some stupid African tribal
charm to make you preg”

She trails off as Gaius takes out a small STATUE of a MAN
WITH AN ENORMOUS ERECT PENIS

GAIUS
It’s Priapus ancient Greek god of
fertility Legend says that if you
rub his member you’1l have a baby
within a year Happy birthday

Laurie takes the statue Tries to be heartfelt

LAURIE
Thank you

Gaius nods encouragingly - rub the statue Laurie self-
consciously STROKES THE STATUE PENIS In the background we
see Gene staring at this in disbelief AS THE POLICE PUT HIM
IN THE SQUAD CAR

INT ZELLER HOUSE - ENTRY FOYER - NIGHT

Laurie and Phil open the door for Laurie’s father WYATT and
two older brothers DARRYL and RUSSELL All three
are big athletic bone-heads Wyatt hugs his daughter

WYATT
Happy birthday baby

LAURIE

PHIL
(indicating Wyatt’s gift)
Ill take that Wyatt

WYATT
Go long doc

Phil freezes awkwardly as Wyatt TOSSES THE GIFT at him It
hits him in the face and falls to the floor

PHIL
Oops Fumble

Wyatt looks at him gives a disappointed sigh and moves on
Phil looks to Darryl’s gift

PHIL (CONT’D)
Can I take that

DARRYL
(disgusted)

They move into the dining room as Phil’s parents GEIR and
MIRA enter They speak with heavy Polish accents Mira is
critical while Geir is more reserved They carry CASSEROLE
DISHES AND BASKETS OF FOOD Phil hugs them

PHIL
Dobry wieczor Tata Mama

They hug Laurie

MIRA
Happy birthday Laurie

LAURIE
Thanks Mira You didn’t need to
bring anything I ordered like ten

guests are hungry for real food

INT ZELLER HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone sits around the dining room table which is now
completely loaded with casserole dishes Mira scoops big
mounds of food onto people’s dishes Several pizza boxes lie
untouched except for the one slice Laurie is eating

RUSSELL
Jackson is all finesse Whenever
anyone plays him bump and run he
can’t get off the line

wasted

WYATT

Laurie Russell Wyatt and Darryl CLINK BEER BOTTLES swig

PHIL
Did you know the 49ers were named
after the California gold rush of
1849

They all stop at his pathetic attempt to be involved

WYATT
Yeah interesting stuff How’s the
medical game doc

PHIL
Good Obviously dealing with HMOs
can be frustrating when they deny
procedures you think are necessary

RUSSELL
I see the same thing in tourism I
booked this couple a honeymoon in
Asia and I’m like you’ve gotta
see Phuket They’ve got the
hottest chicks there it’s in the
name And they’re like no we
want to see temples and crap
Really frustrating

PHIL
Yeah so you get it

MIRA
Laurie how are the rapists

LAURIE
Perverts We’re talking about
spinning off another hidden camera
show Mechanics who lie about oil
changes stuff like that

MIRA
You work too hard Like a man

pregnant

Laurie and Phil exchange a look here we go

PHIL
We’ve been over this Mama We’re
both healthy and fertile there is
no physical reason we’re not
getting pregnant

DARRYL
You know what you’re doing right
Philly

LAURIE
Darryl

DARRYL

I just mean there’s an art to it
maybe they don’t teach in medical
school It’s not just sperm meets
egg and boom

PHIL
It is that actually

GEIR

There’s general shock and surprise at this

WYATT
Now what the hell is that supposed

LAURIE

LAURIE
Hey we’re gonna be better parents

better parents than that

PHIL

parents than that

Phil enters the bathroom where Laurie is looking at the
STICK - NEGATIVE AGAIN She looks up at him tears of
frustration welling He pulls her close

PHIL (CONT’D)

LAURIE
When I’m thirty-five I feel
like we’re running out of time

the Fertile Turtle

PHIL

better in Spanish

LAURIE

to a NINE-YEAR-OLD BOY at the window Phil SWEATING AND
GRIPPING THE ARM RESTS FOR DEAR LIFE leans over to Laurie

PHIL
What parent lets their child fly
alone

LAURIE

Id let our kids fly alone

PHIL
No way What if he’s scared You
have to be there to comfort him
you have to be the strong one

LAURIE
You’re gonna be such a sweet Daddy

She snuggles up to him closes her eyes

BOY
Are you afraid of flying

PHIL
Crashing I’m afraid of crashing

BOY
My mommy says you’re more likely to
die in a car than a plane

PHIL
That statistic is crap Sure if
you drive drunk or recklessly
fine stay out of cars I’ma
safe defensive driver All of
which means nothing if some idiot
decides to fly us into a mountain

The boy looks nervous Laurie opens her eyes

LAURIE
Phil
(to boy)
There’s lots of things worse than
flying Cooties Homework

The boy starts to smile Phil catches on

PHIL

general Septicemia Hemorrhagic
fever blood clots which
ironically you get from flying--

LAURIE
Okay why dont we switch seats

As she unbuckles and starts to crawl over Phil

INT ATRPLANE —- LATER

Phil now sits in the aisle and Laurie in the middle - buffer
She’s fast asleep Phil is deep in conversation with the
boy talking over her

PHIL
You do the math 67 billion
people on the planet Figure maybe
a third of them are Christians
about a fifth of those are
children so were talking what
like 450 million Christian kids
Even if you had five kids living
per household thats 90 million
homes which means he would have to
hit over a thousand chimneys per
second It doesnt add up

BOY
And no tooth fairies or Easter
bunnies either

Phil shakes his head The boy thinks then brightens

BOY (CONT’D)
What about the bogeyman

PHIL

(trying to comfort him)
Oh no Not in a traditional sense
The bogeyman’s more a metaphor for
any criminal that breaks into your
house - burglars rapists
kidnappers So the bogeyman per
se is one thing you don’t have to
worry about

The boy looks worried anyway There’s a DING from the plane
speakers Laurie stirs puts her hand on Phil’s

LAURIE
How are you doing

PHIL
Good Zach here’s been keeping me

As they follow Raul out the Concierge turns back to her wall
of photos sadly caresses one of the babies with her pinkie

EXT LA TORTUGA FERTIL - DAY

witch doctors could do nothing

Phil and Laurie remain silent Finally Raul laughs

RAUL (CONT’D)
Gotcha

Phil and Laurie force laughs Then --

RAUL (CONTD)
She died of AIDS

(then cheerfully)
Look we’re here

Raul stops the golf cart in front of a bungalow and hops out

Raul a few bills Raul gasps delighted

RAUL

Raul bows and backs out of the room Phil turns to Laurie

who’s DUMPING A BUNCH OF PREGNANCY TEST STICKS FROM HER PURSE
INTO A BOWL ON THE COFFEE TABLE

PHIL
You planning to take all of those

LAURIE
It’s kinda Pavlovian at this point
Can’t pee if I don’t see a stick
(then)
So what should we do first

INT PHIL AND LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - SECONDS LATER

Phil and Laurie are in bed making out Phil starts to mount
her for their usual stick-it-in babymaking sex

LAURIE
Wait

PHIL

LAURIE

Well we’re on a tropical island
away from work away from our
families there’s nowhere we need
to be I thought we could slow
it down a little

PHIL
You mean like foreplay

LAURIE
Crazy right
PHIL
I’ve heard of this “foreplay” you
speak of
They laugh Phil jumps out of bed pulls up his pants

LAURIE
Where are you going

PHIL
One second

He runs to the door grabs the DO NOT DISTURB sign opens it

EXT PHIL and LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

As he hangs the sign on the door he nods to a MAID who is
just beginning to sweep some leaves off the path in front

PHIL

He smiles at her and goes back inside

INT PHIL and LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS
Laurie now naked lies seductively in bed smiling

LAURIE
Buenos dias senor

PHIL

She laughs as he jumps into bed and quickly removes his
clothes They begin to kiss It’s nice and playful Laurie
rolls on top of him She reaches her hand down down
beneath the covers as she kisses his neck

LAURIE
Does that feel good

PHIL
Uh-huh

LAURIE
‘Cause it’s been awhile my
technique’s probably pretty
rustyyou sure

PHIL
No you’re good Keep going

Suddenly Phil’s eyes pop open

PHIL (CONT’D)
Stop stop stop stop stop stop --

They both look down Phil looks embarrassed A beat

LAURIE

PHIL
I’m sorry I’m just not used to it
lasting more than thirty seconds
from clothes off to clothes on

LAURIE
Right of course You’ve grown
very efficient

PHIL
I see nipples andit’s Pavlovian

Laurie smiles and kisses him
LAURIE
Don’t worry sweetie We have four

whole days to make a baby

PHIL

They lie there for a beat
LAURIE
So what should we do second
EXT PHIL and LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER
Phil and Laurie exit the bungalow wearing swimsuits and
holding towels The maid who hasn’t made much progress

sweeping in the two minutes since Phil saw her looks at them
quizzically Phil flips the sign to “MAID SERVICE PLEASE”

PHIL
Hola

MAID
Hola

EXT LA TORTUGA FERTIL - POOL - LATER

Laurie and Phil put their towels down on lounge chairs next
to a YOUNG CORNFED LOOKING COUPLE early 20s The woman
lies on a chair while the man stands and holds a BABY’S
hands helping him try to walk

LAURIE
He’s adorable

BRENDA
Yeah he was president of his frat

LAURIE
No I meant

Brenda laughs as she realizes she meant her baby
BRENDA
Oh right Thanks Yeah he’s a
trip Brenda Lundgren And that’s
my husband Scott and my son Carter

They all ad-lib introductions

BRENDA (CONTD)
Do you folks have kids

Phil and Laurie exchange a smile

LAURIE
Well that’s sort of why we’re here
actually We’re doing the get-ya-
pregnant package

BRENDA
Oh my god you guys so are we
It’s like making the first three
was a breeze Scott looked at me
and I was knocked up But we’re
really working up a sweat trying
for number four

PHIL
You have three kids already

SCOTT
Yeah we left the other two at home
with gram and gramps
(fist bumps Brenda)
Score
(fist bumps with Carter)
Score

LAURIE
Wow You guys are so young

BRENDA
Nuh-uh I’m twenty-two already I
don’t want to be one of those sad
old mommies going to soccer games
at 45

Laurie reacts Brenda notices

BRENDA (CONTD)
I don’t mean There’s good stuff
about being older too You have
generations of knowledge to pass
on rich oral traditions

A number of kids play in the pool One of them accidentally
splashes Scott He looks up smiles

Scott
Oh no You’re gonna get it now
Watch out
(handing baby to Brenda)
Here watch him for a sec

He pulls off his shirt and dives into the pool starts
splashing around with the kids They laugh and splash back

Brenda beams as she watches him the young muscled PICTURE
OF PERFECT FATHERHOOD

LAURIE
He’s great with kids

BRENDA
Oh yeah He grew up in a family of
twelve He was born to be a Dad

Now Scott’s GENTLY WRESTLING WITH THE KIDS tossing them
around the pool One kid jumps on his shoulders

Phil looks at Scott - it’s almost intimidating how good he is
with kids Laurie squeezes Phil’s hand

LAURIE
I can’t wait to see you in the
backyard tossing a football rough-
housing with our kids

PHIL
Why wait I think I’1l take a dip

He stands takes off his shirt revealing a much less muscled
physique than Scott Then he steps gingerly down the stairs
into the pool trying to get adjusted to the cold water

PHIL (CONT’D)
Who wants to play

The kids all gather around him “Me” “I do” He throws a
couple of them - it takes a little more effort for him than
for Scott and they don’t go as far But they’re having fun

ON LAURIE - watching Phil a proud smile on her face

BRENDA
Aww he’s gonna be a great father

LAURIE
Yeah He didn’t grow up with
brothers or sisters so he loves
playing with kids

Phil and Scott are laughing and tossing the kids to each
other One particularly FAT BOY approaches Phil

FAT BOY
Throw me
PHIL
(eyeing his heft)
Um maybe it’s more fun to jump

off the side

The boy looks at him sadly Phil glances at Laurie who’s
smiling at him

PHIL (CONT’D)
Okay

He gathers him up getting ready to try to heave him out of
the water

PHIL (CONT’D)
On one on two on three

He throws him with all his might Too much might The boy
sails out past the edge of the pool onto the pavement

FAT BOY
Owww OWWW OWWW OWWW OWWWwwww

The boy’s FRANTIC MOTHER gasps and rushes over to him

BOY’S MOTHER
Topher Is there a doctor here

From the pool Phil slowly raises his hand Off Laurie
horrified

INT RESORT MEDICAL CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

Phil Laurie and the mother look on as DR AMAROSA kindly native to the island finishes stitching up a cut on
the boy’s leg Dr Amarosa is a natural with kids

DR AMAROSA
I think these stitches are going to
heal fine but just to be safe do
you know what these are

He holds up a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE The boy shakes his head

DR AMAROSA PHIL
Magic pills Amoxicillin

The doctor glances at Phil then continues

DR AMAROSA (CONT’D)
Now you’re going to take one magic
pill every day for a week And you
have to finish all of them even
when you’re feeling better

FAT BOY
Why

Phil kneels down tries to talk in a kid-friendly voice

PHIL
Well Topher the pathogens in your
body develop something called
“antimicrobial resistance”--

DR AMAROSA
Because otherwise the magic spell
won’t work Now pick a hand

He holds out two fists The boy chooses and the doctor
opens his hand revealing a PACK OF GUM

DR AMAROSA (CONT’D)
Bubblegum Yay

The boy grins and takes it The mother smiles to the doctor

BOY’S MOTHER
Thank you so much

PHIL
He’s gonna be fine If you want me
to check on him later

She glares at Phil as she leaves with her son

DR AMAROSA
Some people don’t feel comfortable
going to a doctor who’s already
hurt their child So you guys
have the conception package

LAURIE
We’ll be more careful when we have
one of our own

DR AMAROSA
No I just meant the package comes
with a complimentary island
fertility treatment It’s a
beautiful and ancient Aztec ritual

LAURIE PHIL
Wow That sounds great No thanks we’re good

LAURIE
Honey this stuff is why we’re here

PHIL
I’m just really not into the island
voodoo thing

He realizes how elitist this sounds and tries to backtrack
digging himself deeper Laurie just stares at him

PHIL (CONTD)

Not that what you do is voodoo I’m
sure it’s much more beautiful and
quaint than-- Not quaint just
I’m a cynical western medicine
guy Not that that’s better than
I mean you obviously went to a
great-- do they call it medical
school here Madrasa

DR AMAROSA
SUNY Syracuse

He indicates the medical school diploma framed on his wall

PHIL
Uh-huh Yeah let’s do the ritual

He nods enthusiastically

INT NATIVE TEMPLE —- DAY

Phil Laurie and Dr Amarosa sit on the stone floor of a
small but pretty native temple Several ISLANDERS sit with
them to aid in the ceremony Phil Laurie and the Doctor
wear LONG GARLANDS OF FLOWERS and BEADS around their necks
wrists and ankles The Doctor smiles as he lights a candle

DR AMAROSA
Xipe totec father of fertility
please feel the love of these two
beautiful people and help them
share that love with a third

Phil and Laurie smile at each other this is kind of nice

DR AMAROSA (CONT’D)
Now you say “techteteochihua”

PHIL and LAURIE
Techteteochihua

DR AMAROSA
Now we bathe ourselves in the
sweet milk of crushed almonds

Islanders guide Phil and Laurie to lie down as they pour
almond milk over them and massage it in It’s heavenly

DR AMAROSA (CONTD)
to remind us that the journey
into this world should be filled
with joy Techteteochihua

PHIL and LAURIE
Techteteochihua

DR AMAROSA
And these small pearls remind us
that each new life is a precious
gem that must be treasured

The Islanders sprinkle the small pearls over them

PHIL and LAURIE
Techteteochihua

DR AMAROSA
The warm salt water reminds us to
surround your child with love as
the seas protect the land

They pour warm relaxing salt water over them

PHIL and LAURIE
Techteteochihua

DR AMAROSA
The blood of a sheep reminds us
that birth is messy and bloody

Phil and Laurie open their eyes as the Islanders trickle
BLOOD from a sheep’s bladder all over them

PHIL LAURIE
Hold on-- Um--

DR AMAROSA (CONTD)
Techteteochihua

PHIL and LAURIE
(reluctantly)
techteteochihua

DR AMAROSA
Birth is also painful like the
excruciating bite of the Chichoo
spider

One of the Islanders opens a small box and a BIG HAIRY
SPIDER crawls out As it starts heading towards Phil and
Laurie

PHIL
Okay that’s probably enough We
should get going

They start to stand up but the Islanders hold them down by
the garlands of beads and flowers like chains

DR AMAROSA
And the garlands of beads remind us
of the chains that bind you to your
child Techteteochihua

ISLANDERS
(chanting)
Techteteochihuatechteteochihua

The Doctor uses the candle to light a wick in front of a
LARGE STATUE The flame quickly spreads along the perimeter
of the statue illuminating it - it’s a frightening man
wearing a coat of human skin Its eyes now BLAZE WITH FIRE
Phil and Laurie look on with horror - it’s like the ceremony
from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom

DR AMAROSA
Xipe Totec what will it take for
you to give these people a child
(after a beat)

Yes We will sacrifice for you
Yes we will wear the flayed skin
of an innocent for twenty days in
your honor

He takes out a JEWELED CEREMONIAL DAGGER as a SOLEMN ISLAND
BOY STEPS FORWARD HOLDING A SMALL BOX The Boy bows his head
as if he’s ready to be sacrificed

LAURIE
No no oh god stop Please don’t
do this

PHIL

Seriously we can’t be wearing skin
anyway we have jobs it would
smell We don’t even wear fur

Then the Boy takes a ROOSTER from the box and holds it over
his head The Doctor SLITS ITS THROAT

In the spider’s GIANT BLACK EYES we see the reflection of
the boy holding the twitching bleeding rooster over his head
in front of the flaming statue as the chanting continues

ISLANDERS
Techteteochihuatechteteochihua
-techteteochihua

EXT LA TORTUGA FERTIL - LATE AFTERNOON

Phil and Laurie limp back to their room in shell-shocked
silence covered in blood and smashed flowers traumatized
INT PHIL AND LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - LATE AFTERNOON

Phil and Laurie open the door and limp inside They see that

the room has been turned down for a romantic night candles
scattered rose petals romantic music

PHIL
I don’t think I can

LAURIE
Yeah I think I’d start equating
sex with death

PHIL
I need a drink Do you wanna go
get a drink

Phil goes into the bathroom to wash up at the sink Laurie
picks up the phone dials

LAURIE
I’m just gonna check in with work
before they go home for the day

PHIL
Well they’re gonna have to start
learning to get on without you when--

Phil walks out patting his face dry Laurie holds up a
finger to wait someone’s picked up

LAURIE

Hey it’s Laurie Just checking
in How’s 509

(then)
What No the minute we do product
placement we lose all credibility
What idiots want to see their
products on a show about perverts

She covers the phone looks at Phil apologetically

LAURIE (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’ve got to handle this
Go without me

PHIL
Okay but--

LAURIE
(back on phone)
Yeah I get we’re being paid to say
it but what we’re saying is - if
your daughter uses Axe body spray
strangers will molest her In your
Sears outfitted kitchen

Phil leaves as Laurie continues talking

EXT HOTEL BAR - EVENING

Phil walks in to the open-air bar on the beach He passes
the Concierge who is sitting alone drinking and slightly
weeping as she stares at a HAPPY COUPLE PLAYING WITH THEIR
BABY on the beach She notices Phil tries to smile

CONCIERGE
Oh hi Mr Zeller Are you
enjoying your stay

PHIL
Yeah Great Thanks

CONCIERGE
Let me know if you need anything

Phil sits down to the bar WINSTON the tall good-looking
super-cool bartender comes up to him

PHIL
Scotch

Winston pours him a gigantic triple pour

PHIL (CONT’D)
Whoa not that much

WINSTON
A man needs a drink after seeing
the fertility doc

PHIL
How did you know that

WINSTON
Youve got that hollow terrified
look in your eyes And you’ve got
some rooster blood on your neck

Phil rubs it off his with a napkin Looks at the drink

PHIL
It’s just too much alcohol can
impair potency

Winston laughs shakes his head

WINSTON
I’ve gotten twelve different women
pregnant and I was drunk for all
of them Some of them was because
I was drunk

PHIL
Youve had twelve kids What’s
your secret

WINSTON

You want to know what my secret is
Come closer

(Phil leans in)
Closer

(Phil leans in more)
I fucked ‘em I fucked ‘em all
Fucked ‘em good fucked ‘em hard
fucked ‘em frequent All this
other stuff here it’s bullshit

PHIL
Well there is evidence that
reducing stress increases fertility

WINSTON
Yeah you know what reduces stress
Fucking
(then)
Excuse me for a second

He grabs a bottle and goes to refill the Concierge’s glass as
Phil downs the entire scotch

WINSTON (CONT’D)
Hey don’t cry so much You’ll
ruin those lovely eyes

She touches her eyes then looks up at him gratefully

CONCIERGE
Do you want to come home with me

WINSTON

He walks back to Phil refills his glass to the brim

WINSTON (CONT’D)
What was I saying

PHIL

of fucking
PHIL

WINSTON
You love your wife
PHIL
Yeah
WINSTON

You attracted to your wife

PHIL
Yes of course

WINSTON
Then why are you down here talking
to me instead of in your room

Phil considers this Then he stands up
PHIL
You’re right I’m gonna go I’m

gonna go fuck my wife

WINSTON
Fuck her

PHIL
(slamming his drink)
I’m going to fuck her

WINSTON
Sing it from the rooftops baby

Phil stumbles off screaming as everyone stares
PHIL
I’m gonna go fuck my wife I’m

WINSTON
Yeah there you go

He goes to refill the Concierge’s glass again

CONCIERGE
Hey speaking of fu--

WINSTON
Nope

INT PHIL AND LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Phil stumbles in the door He sees Laurie has fallen asleep
on the bed surrounded by papers He nudges her She stirs

PHIL
Hey Heeeeyyyyy-

LAURIE
(still half-asleep)
Hey I’m sorry I feel asleep

PHIL
Sok Let’s make a baby Baby

LAURIE
Baby I’m asleep Let’s do it

PHIL

Can you really wait until tomorrow
for all this

He drops his pants to the floor trying to make her laugh
Then he looks down She’s completely asleep again

He sighs He moves the papers off the bed and covers her
sweetly with the blankets Then he climbs into bed kisses
her on the head and drifts off to sleep

INT PHIL and LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - MORNING

Laurie gently shakes Phil awake She holds a steaming MUG of
something

LAURIE
Honey Time to wake up I thought
we could go into town today

With great effort Phil opens his eyes He’s pretty
hungover He moans a little

LAURIE (CONT’D)
Here They dropped this off for
you

Laurie hands him the mug and heads into the bathroom Phil
takes a big swig of the liquid then gags now fully awake

PHIL
Oh god What is this It’s
moving

LAURIE (0S)
They said caffeine impairs your
fertility This has live algae for
sperm beauty or luster or something

PHIL
Sperm luster

Phil pushes the mug away shuddering Laurie comes out of
the bathroom holding a PREGNANCY TEST she just took

LAURIE
I don’t know Pretty sperm Don’t
you want pretty sperm baby

She sits down next to Phil and they both look at the test -
as another NEGATIVE SIGN APPEARS Phil smiles comfortingly

PHIL
It takes days to get a positive -
even when you’re pregnant

Laurie nods but she’s clearly crestfallen Phil sighs
picks up the mug and supportively takes a GIANT SWIG

PHIL (CONT’D)
(gagging)
It’s not so bad

off a grateful Laurie

INT LA TORTUGA FERTIL - LOBBY - DAY

Phil and Laurie walk up to the Concierge who is busy
fiddling with something at her desk

LAURIE
Hi do we need to sign up for the
trip into town

CONCIERGE
You can just catch the bus down in
the car park

They notice what she’s fiddling with - she’s POKING HOLES
INTO WRAPPED CONDOMS with a small pin

PHIL
You know those condoms won’t be
effective if you put holes in them

CONCIERGE
Oh really I definitely won’t use
them then Thanks for your help

They walk on as she continues poking holes

IE BUS - DAY

Raul drives the small beat-up bus along a dusty dirt road
He talks to the passengers over a BULLHORN which is way too
loud for the tiny bus

RAUL
The village of Huitlacoche is named
after Juan Huitlacoche who brought
higher education to our country
Second grade Just a joke

The bus is full of VARIOUS HOTEL GUESTS Phil and Laurie sit
together near Scott Brenda and their baby

BRENDA
I love seeing the local culture
You can buy Christmas ornaments and
such for next to nothing in their
little shops

SCOTT
We’ll stock up babe
(to Phil and Laurie)
Do you guys do a real tree or
plastic

BRENDA
Scott That’s personal
(to Laurie)
Sorry

LAURIE
No it’s okay We don’t celebrate
Christmas I mean I do but Phil
grew up Jewish and now is sort of

PHIL
A devout believer of nothing

Phil and Laurie laugh Brenda and Scott don’t

PHIL (CONTD)
Basically we have our own personal
beliefs but we don’t feel the need
to formally practice the rituals
BRENDA
(horrified)
So your children won’t celebrate
anything

LAURIE
Well obviously we’ll still buy
them gifts in December

PHIL
Sure obviously

LAURIE
Santa will fill their stockings

PHIL
Um not Santa That would be
celebrating Christmas

LAURIE
Honey Santa’s completely secular
He’s a fat guy who brings toys

PHIL
In honor of Jesus Christ your lord
and saviour’s birthday

LAURIE
Jesus was a historical figure You
want to pretend he never existed

PHIL
No I want them to know that he was
an ordinary guy not the son of God

LAURIE
You can’t tell them that he for
sure wasn’t the son of God That’s
raising them Jewish

PHIL
That’s not raising them Jewish
it’s raising them nothing
LAURIE

So youre saying you’d rather have
your children believe in nothing
than have the comfort of knowing
there’s something out there

PHIL
I’m saying I don’t want to
indoctrinate them with outdated
beliefs and superstitions

LAURIE
Fine But as long as we’re ruling
out anything even tangentially
related to religion let’s skip
circumcision too

PHIL
(beat takes breath)
How about we expose them to all of
it When they’re old enough they
can decide what they want to
believe or not believe Fair

LAURIE
Fair

PHIL
Okay

They smile hold hands Problem solved Until --

BRENDA
So where you gonna tell them their
pets go when they die

Phil and Laurie’s smiles fade Silence

EXT TOWN OF HUITLACOCHE - DAY

A typical third world kind of touristy village They all
file off the bus past Raul

RAUL
Welcome to Huitlacoche The
residents here are very friendly
And the best part is if you kill
one its only a twelve dollar
fine Kidding

(then)

But seriously your embassy would
probably take care of it

Laurie’s reading from a guidebook

LAURIE
Ooh it says this village has some
of the oldest known indigenous art -

SCOTT
Oh snap bungee jumping I always
wanted us to do that

Scott’s spotted some sketchy looking TOUR GUIDES in a pick-up
truck A shitty handmade wooden sign offering bungee jumping
is tied to the side of the truck by a few ROPES

BRENDA
I don’t know is it safe

TOUR GUIDE
Oh si Safest way to travel

SCOTT
See We’1ll do it together if
you’re scared

BRENDA
What about the baby

Scott turns to Phil and Laurie

SCOTT
You guys mind Just for a few
hours
PHIL LAURIE
Oh we were gonna shop Yes Let us babysit
around so
LAURIE

Come on honey It’ll be fun And
well need the practice

PHIL
Okay
(to Brenda and Scott)
Just be careful

Brenda and Scott climb into the back of the truck with a few
other TOURISTS

SCOTT
You don’t have to worry about us

Scott slaps the side of the truck and one of the ROPES
holding the BUNGEE SIGN SNAPS Phil and Laurie look alarmed

TOUR GUIDE
Oh that happens all the time
EXT TOWN OF HUITLACOCHE - STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Laurie’s holding the baby cooing as they stroll through
town

LAURIE
Oh hello hello you are just
precious aren’t you
(then)
Oh look - native masks

As Laurie bends down to look at the street vendor’s MASKS
spread out on a blanket she shifts the baby under her arm
holding it like a football

PHIL
Honey you need to support the head

LAURIE
Phil I know how to hold a baby I
had dolls when I was a kid

Laurie barely notices she’s TRYING ON A MASK

PHIL
Okay but more important than
actually holding the baby is
focusing on the baby You can’t
get distracted when you’re with a
baby you have to pay attention

Laurie turns around wearing a WEIRD LOOKING AZTEC MASK

LAURIE
Hmmm

PHIL
Nothing

Phil takes the baby from her and puts it in the stroller
they continue walking

PHIL (CONTD)
So You wouldn’t really not want
to circumcise our child would you
I mean our son - I wouldn’t want to
circumcise a girl or anything

LAURIE
Cutting a little baby’s penis It’s
barbaric And just unnecessary

Is it really that important to you

PHIL
I don’t know I guess I’m just
surprised I didn’t know you felt
so strongly about it

Laurie re-adjusts the baby to another terrible position The
baby’s head lolls off her shoulder dangerously Phil winces

As

LAURIE
Look we’re not gonna see eye to
eye on every little thing But if
were just honest with each other
we can work things out

PHIL
Right You’re right

They kiss sweetly

LAURIE
Like vaccines I mean I know you
give them all the time but

PHIL
But what

LAURIE
Well honey they’re poison And
no one gets polio anymore

Laurie heads into a store As Phil taken aback starts to
follow her in

PHIL

That’s why no one gets polio
anymore

INT CLOTHING STORE - DAY

PHIL
No one gets shanked either
EXT FLAVORED ICE VENDOR - DAY

Phil and Laurie (and the baby) eat ICES at an OUTDOOR STAND

LAURIE
It’s good for children to grow up
with dogs Then they’re not
afraid

PHIL
They should be afraid Those dogs

and teeth They’re not animals
they’re weapons

EXT QUAINT STONE WALKWAY - DAY

PHIL

antibodies and nutrients it’s a
time for you to bond with the baby -

LAURIE

INT SOUVENIR STAND - DAY

LAURIE
No Uh-uh

EXT TOWN OF HUITLACOCHE - STREET - DAY

Phil and Laurie (and the baby) walk in silence for a beat a
little exhausted by all the discussion Laurie spots a
storefront with a sign reading “ACCESO A INTERNET”

LAURIE
Oh hey internet café You mind if

PHIL
Okay I’11 be around

Laurie heads off with the baby in the stroller into --

bar than a café A few SEEDY LOOKING MEN sit at the bar
drinking and smoking Laurie approaches the BARTENDER

LAURIE
Con permiso um this is café
Internet café

BARTENDER
Si internet

He points to a dark corner where there is one computer that
looks like it’s from 1991

LAURIE
Gracias

Laurie parks the stroller next to the computer dumps a mound
of cigarette butts off the keyboard and sits down

ON COMPUTER It reads “Bienvenido a Mexico En Linea” She
clicks “Signo En” We hear the sound of a SLOW DIAL-UP

I just want my son’s penis to look
like mine What’s wrong with that

PHIL
It’s a good dick It doesn’t need
to wear a turtleneck

PHIL
Thank you Did I mention she left
the baby in a bar

WINSTON
Yeah you said

PHIL
She’s not gonna cut back on work
not that it matters since
apparently Jesus will be raising
our child

CONCIERGE

It’s not right I know women who
would literally kill to be a
mother Cut the baby out of a
pregnant woman hide it ina
suitcase and fly to a country that
doesn’t allow extradition like
Venezuela or Andorra or Madagascar
I know women like that

WINSTON
You ever hear the theory that all
women are either mothers or whores
Maybe your lady just isn’t the
mother type

PHIL
So youre saying my wife’s a whore

WINSTON
(shrugs)
I don’t know your life

He turns around to get another bottle The Concierge quickly
takes a VIAL out of her cleavage and dumps some POWDER into
both Winston’s drink and her own She looks at Phil as she
mixes it in with her pinky then puts a finger to her lips -
don’t say anything Winston turns back

WINSTON (CONT’D)
All I’m saying is a person is who
she is Not much you can do to
change them

CONCIERGE
There that’s it Poetry Makes
my eyes water My lovely eyes
remember when you said last
night you said

WINSTON
(picking up his drink)
Hmm

drink long swigs

Laurie tries to relax for a beat Then

LAURIE
Scott’s a great dad He’s really
good with kids

BRENDA
Mmm-hmm

LAURIE
Was he like that right away or was
there kind of a learning curve

BRENDA
Scott’s a natural He just has a
magic touch If they’re fussy or
crying Scott just sings rap to
them and they stop

LAURIE
He raps to them Aren’t those
songs a little too “I’m gonna rape
you bitch”

BRENDA

Oh no no He just raps like --

(bad rap imitation)
“It-it-it-it-it Itsty Bitsy Spider
crawled up your fat ass water
spout” It’s cute

Don’t get me wrong I love my kids

I just can’t have another one

PHIL
Why don’t you say that to Brenda

SCOTT
She wants a big family I can’t
tell her I’m crushing her dreams

PHIL
So you’d rather soak your testicles
in hot liquids every day

SCOTT
Not just that I wear crazy tight
underwear I bike fifteen miles to
work every day I jerk off
constantly I try to imagine my
sperm are little swimming Iraqi
soldiers and I’m the US Air Force
laying shock ‘n awe on their ass

Phil double-takes at his metaphor

PHIL
Well the not sleeping the
diapers the messit’s hard

SCOTT
Are you kidding That’s the easy
stuff It’s the pressure man

PHIL
The pressure

SCOTT
Little kids all they do is watch
you and copy you No matter what
dumbass shit you do they think
that’s the way you’re supposed to
do it cause you and your wife are
their only example of what a
human’s supposed to be You curse
they curse You smoke one
cigarette bam you just made them
a smoker for life

PHIL
They’re not robots they don’t
remember every little thing

SCOTT
Yeah but you don’t know what
they’re going to remember and what
they’re not The human brain’s
like a Super Soaker

PHIL
A sponge right

SCOTT

So youve got to be perfect every
single moment of every day And
even if you think you can do that

you messes up just makes the
tiniest little mistake you coulda
just ruined your childs life

completely relaxed Laurie’s Masseur is sweating as he
kneads elbows and pummels her as hard as he can

We’re never around kids so I never
noticed how completely incapable
Phil is of talking to them or
playing with them or dealing with
(realizing)
Phil’s terrible with kids

BRENDA
He’s just not used to them yet

LAURIE
He’s a pediatrician He spends
every second of every day with

them

BRENDA
Yeah but not his kids He’1l love
his kids

LAURIE

So that means he acts like a freak
around other people’s kids because
they’re not his What kind of
person does that

BRENDA
That’s not what--

LAURIE

Did I mention he wants to send them
to some militant private school
So they can be as tightly wound and
repressed as he is And if that
doesn’t do it the nightly beatings
and bedtime lectures about the
inexistence of god definitely will

(then off the massage)
Goddamnit

Exasperated Laurie sits up
LAURIE (CONTD)

INT PHIL AND LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Phil comes out of the bathroom and Laurie’s lying in the
position he left her in legs in the air He gets in bed

PHIL
Good night

LAURIE
Night

INT HOTEL RESTAURANT - MORNING

Phil and Laurie read newspapers and eat breakfast silently
The concierge approaches them with a clipboard She’s
obviously been crying and seems angry

CONCIERGE
Mr and Mrs Zeller should I put
you down for the feast tonight

PHIL
What feast

CONCIERGE
We watch the sea turtles swim up
the shore to mate under the
moonlight It’s romantic which
I’ve learned means very different
things to different people

She glances angrily towards the bar at Winston

LAURIE
Turtle porn I don’t see how we
can skip that

CONCIERGE
If you say you’re coming you have
to come You can’t just go making
promises about things to people and
then breaking those promises after
you get what you want

She looks at Winston again Laurie smiles wanly

LAURIE
We’1ll be there

The concierge makes a note on her clipboard
CONCIERGE

Also today is a good day for a dip
in the fertility springs

LAURIE
Oh well probably pass on that
CONCIERGE
(stopping short)
But that’s crazy you’re being

crazy Everyone who swims in the
fertility springs gets pregnant
Everyone does

PHIL
Okay well maybe--

CONCIERGE
(increasingly hysterical)

God already has a baby in mind for
you and if you don’t soak in the
fertility springs then you can’t
have that baby That’s like you’re
killing the baby You’re killing
Gods little baby

As she gets louder people start to look at them Phil looks
around embarrassed He quickly shushes her

PHIL
Okay okay we’ll go to the springs

CONCIERGE
(suddenly calm again)
Well whatever You can if you
want to We also have a sea shell
painting class for guests so
either one would be fun

EXT FERTILITY SPRINGS - DAY

A beautiful series of crystal clear lakes and waterfalls on a
secluded bluff overlooking the ocean An ENTHUSIASTIC COUPLE
climbs out of the springs and hops down the path

EXT HILLY PATH - CONTINUOUS

The couple turns right at a hill and playfully chases each
other up it They nod to Phil and Laurie who are in bathing
suits walking down slowly not looking nearly as excited

LAURIE
Fertility springs

ENTHUSIASTIC MAN
They’re amazing Really beautiful

ENTHUSIASTIC WOMAN
Honestly I already feel pregnant

ENTHUSIASTIC MAN
You’re about to be

He grabs her and they start making out in the middle of the
narrow path Phil and Laurie wait an awkward beat
Finally

PHIL
Sorry just ‘xcuse us

They squeeze past them and continue down the hill to where it
FORKS There’s a SMALL INCONSPICUOUS SIGN reading FERTILITY
SPRINGS with an arrow pointing LEFT Phil and Laurie both
SEE it but BOTH PRETEND NOT TO Phil casually stands in
front of the sign acting lost

PHIL (CONTD)
I’m not sure where it is

LAURIE
(also acting confused)
Hmm I don’t know I feel like

She pretends to think So does Phil Finally he shrugs his
shoulders and points right

PHIL
That way

LAURIE
I was just gonna say that

EXT DISGUSTING SWAMP - DAY

Laurie and Phil are now both neck deep in a revolting
brackish polluted pond They’re each grossed out and each
trying to hide it

LAURIE
It looks different than you’d think
it would You can really smell the
sulfur

PHIL
Yeah But um it makes sense
There’s probably lots of mineral-
rich muds that um you know

LAURIE
Sure this is where all the
cosmetics come from Women pay
150 for a tiny jar of this stuff

PHIL
It burns a little bit In a good
way like it’s working

Behind them a CLUMP OF TANGLED USED CONDOMS floats past

PHIL (CONTD)
But you know we need to be ready
in case It’s not gonna be the
end of the world if this doesn’t
work right

LAURIE
Oh I know no Obviously wed
both be disappointed

PHIL
Really disappointed

LAURIE
But it’s not like we’re not
totally happy now without
children Things are good Things
areperfect

PHIL
Exactly I love just being married
to you even if we never had a kid
I feel fulfilled

LAURIE
Completely fulfilled

They both stand there in the water silently contemplating
Behind some rocks obscured to them we see a large SEWAGE
PIPE emptying into the pond We hear the sound of a FAINT
FLUSH as some more brown sludge trickles out

INT PHIL AND LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - DAY

Phil and Laurie lie on top of the covers in bed They are
both covered in HIDEOUS RED BUMPY RASHES

LAURIE
I’m debating between facing the
burning agony of peeing again or
throwing myself out the window

PHIL
We’re on the ground floor

LAURIE
Damn

There’s a knock at the door

LAURIE (CONTD)
That must be the skin cream Will
you get it

She limps into the bathroom Phil gingerly gets up and goes
to the door He opens it to Raul who holds a tube of cream

RAUL
You called for-- whoa Are you
okay senor

PHIL
Yeah A little rashy no big deal

We hear a faint trickling from the bathroom

LAURIE (0S)
AAAAAHHHHH IT BURNS LIKE A BITCH

RAUL
You don’t need skin cream you need
new skin

PHIL
Ha Right

RAUL
Luckily for thirty American
dollars I can bring you the skin
of any native of your choosing
It’s easier to keep clean than a
mink Impress all your friends

PHIL
You know your little passive-
aggressive jokes get a bit thin

RAUL

Youre right Im sorry about that
(a beat then)

Its not personal or anything It
just gets frustrating seeing rich
American tourists traveling here
all the time You swim in our
waters rub our ancient statues
like this place will solve all your
problems get you pregnant or
whatever But this is our home
not the Mayo clinic And anyway
sometimes what’s really wrong with
a couple can’t be fixed by four
days at a resort you know

PHIL
Yeah Yeah I know

Phil hands Raul a dollar starts to shut the door

RAUL
Ah a whole dollar For life-
changing wisdom You are too kind

INT PHIL AND LAURIE’S BUNGALOW - BATHROOM - SAME TIME

Laurie gingerly SPLASHES her face with cold water wincing
the pain As she dabs her face dry with a washcloth she
happens to glance at the PREGNANCY STICK on the counter
Laurie holds it up for a closer look It’s POSITIVE

at

EXT BEACH - NIGHT

A romantic FERTILITY FEAST by the water Couples sit
variously around the torch-lit beach cuddling and watching
GIGANTIC SEA TURTLES mating in tide pools

A small island band led by the hang drum Musician from the
meditation class plays a strange islandy rendition of
Purple Rain by Prince

MUSICIAN
--I only wanted to see you
laughing in the purple rain
Purple rain purple rain

Winston has his arms around a GORGEOUS YOUNG ISLAND WOMAN
The Concierge stares at them and fumes then returns to
explaining the mating process to a rapt Brenda and Scott

CONCIERGE
The male turtle is using the claws
on his fore flippers to hang onto
the female for deeper penetration
That’s how she likes it

BRENDA
And you can tell that because of
the position of her shell

CONCIERGE

(loudly so Winston hears)
No It’s just clear these two have
a sexual relationship that’s built
on open communication He’s not
the type of turtle who finishes
first and doesn’t care about her
climax He never leaves her alone
after sex ‘cause he “has shit to
take care of”

BRENDA
And I heard they can have over 300
babies
(to Scott)
Isnt that amazing

Scott nods a little pained and when Brenda turns back to
the Concierge he KNEELS DOWN NEXT TO THE MALE TURTLE WHOS
MOUNTED ON THE FEMALE whispers --

SCOTT
Pull out Pull out now

We FIND Laurie and Phil sitting on the beach a few feet
over Both watch the turtle orgy lost in thought

LAURIE
What do you think of the name
Robin

PHIL
Huh

LAURIE

If we ever do get pregnant Robin
works for a boy or girl

PHIL
Robin sounds like a gay superhero
or something Robin Hood Batman
and Robin

LAURIE
Theres Robin Williams Robin
Leach Robin Gibb of the Bee
Gees

PHIL
Not really helping your case

LAURIE
Phil theres something --

PHIL
How about Jim Or Jenny Plain
but solid

LAURIE

Boring But I guess we could have
fun with the spelling Like Jenny
spelled “G-Y-N-N-Y-E” or--

PHIL
(abruptly)
I don’t think we should have kids

She looks at him shocked

LAURIE
What

PHIL
We gave it our best shot and
Honestly did we ever really even
want kids or were we just doing
what society said we were supposed
to do

LAURIE
I can’t-- I don’t even know --
(standing up)
You know what Good Great
That’s perfect

She storms away down the beach Phil scrambles to follow
her

PHIL
It’s not personal Think of it
this way Maybe all this trouble
weve been having getting pregnant
is nature’s way of telling us
something

LAURIE
Yeah What’s that

PHIL
That we shouldn’t be carrying on
the human race together We
shouldn’t feel bad it’s just
natural selection and we’re not
selected

Laurie whirls on him enraged

LAURIE
Youd be a terrible father anyway

PHIL
Laurie c’mon there’s no need to

LAURIE
You’re terrible with kids You
don’t know how to talk to them you
don’t know how to play with them
No wonder your patients hate you

PHIL
They don’t hate me Kids don’t
like going to the doctor

LAURIE
Yeah but they really hate going to
you You’re mean and you’re
insensitive and you terrify
children Have you seen your
waiting room It’s like the line
into Treblinka

PHIL
Well okay maybe I’m not Doctor Fun
Guy but at least I’m responsible
I can hold a baby without breaking
its neck I’m not a pathological
workaholic And I would never ever
EVER leave a baby -

LAURIE
Oh don’t even go there --

PHIL
IN A BAAAAAR

LAURIE
IT WAS AN INTERNET CAFE

PHIL
JUST CAUSE A BAR HAS AN INTERNET
CONNECTION DOESN’T MAKE IT A CAFE

CONCIERGE (0S)
Where the hell do you think you’re
going

THEY BOTH FREEZE turn around to see the Concierge screaming
at some turtles as a male turtle dismounts the female and
begins trudging back into the ocean

CONCIERGE (CONT’D)
No You can’t just screw her and
leave You have to stay with her
You have to stay with her forever

The turtle keeps walking She screams and runs over to it
grabbing it and trying to keep it from getting away

CONCIERGE (CONT’D)
You have to stay Come back here
No No You stay NO

Laurie turns back to Phil the fight drained out of her She
just lookssad

LAURIE
Just be honest Do you really not
want to have kids Or do you just
not want to have kids with me

PHIL
(a beat then)
I don’t want to have kids with you

Laurie swallows

PHIL (CONTD)
And you don’t want to have kids
with me either So isn’t it better
that we realize it now before we
get stuck taking care of one
together for the next 18 years

LAURIE
Yeah

She turns As she walks away from him

LAURIE (CONT’D)
At least we’re not stuck

We hear the Musician start to sing his version of another

singing the song as we

-e’s -ot -aggy He’s a good man
He’s funny and smart and kind to
animals even though he hates
themhe’s my best friend Was

WYATT
So you had a little disagreement
about how to raise kids

LAURIE
A little disagreement He doesn’t
want to have this baby with me And
I don’t blame him We have
completely opposite ideas of how to
parent a child And trying to make
that work means fighting for the
next eighteen years I don’t want
to do that to a kid I don’t want
to do that to us

WYATT
Well you’re both gonna be parents
whether you like it or not

LAURIE
Yeah
(then)
But maybe we’ll be better as
separate ones

WYATT
Yknow your mother and I were
terrible parents

LAURIE
No you weren’t

WYATT
Oh we were I was on the road most
of the time and your mother - god
bless her soul in heaven - was off
fucking her astrologer We left
you at home with your brothers who
would drop you on your head pretty
much every day Not accidentally
either They’d spike you

LAURIE
I guess that’s why my head is flat
in back
Wyatt smiles at her

INT PHIL’S PARENTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

A despondent Phil sits with Mira and Geir at the table in

their kitchen which is filled to the brim with POLISH
TCHOTCHKES Mira cheerfully serves up large portions of

Polish food happier than we’ve ever seen her

MIRA
Have some flaki

PHIL
No thanks Mama

She spoons some into his bowl anyway

PHIL (CONTD)
I don’t want any fucking flaki
(she’s taken aback)
Sorry I just I’m not sleeping I
can’t stop thinking that I might
have screwed up the best thing that
ever happened to me

MIRA
And what was that

PHIL
(beat then)
Laurie Laurie Mom

MIRA
(surprised)
Oh

PHIL
Should I have just overlooked
everything Just not mentioned
that I didn’t want our child raised
in a germ-ridden daycare center
literally praying to Jesus he
doesn’t get mumps or Rubella

MIRA
Nie You are much better off now

PHIL
I mean a father’s supposed to
protect his child How do you do
that when the child’s own mother
won’t breastfeed or vaccinate or
send it to private school--

GEIR

Enough
(they look at him)

You think you can break a child so
easy My father grew up with
pogroms and Cossacks My brother
survived the Nazis I survived the
Communists So maybe your kid can
survive a few years in the public
school system

PHIL
Yeah but what kind of person will
he grow up to be

MIRA
I read child of working mother ten
times more likely to be rapist

Geir shoots Mira a sharp look

GEIR
A child will turn out the way he’s
going to turn out no matter what
you do Look at you We fed you
Polish food your whole life
Still you hate Polish food

PHIL
I’m just not the biggest fan of
tripe Or ketchup on pizza

GEIR
The only important thing for a
child is that his parents love each
other Do you love Laurie

PHIL
Obviously I I mean love
isn’t When we can’t even agree--

GEIR
Do you love her

PHIL
Yes More than anything

MIRA
(can’t help herself)
Why
Geir shoots her another stern look then turns back to Phil
GEIR
Then stop bitching and tell her
this

Phil takes this in

INT PHIL’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Phil’s looking out his window as the car chase passes by

PHIL
Jesus Maniac

Then he notice in his rearview mirror another POLICE CAR
sirens on chasing him As he pulls his car over

PHIL (CONTD)
Are you kidding me
EXT STREET - CONTINUOUS

The SAME POLICEMAN WHO PULLED LAURIE OVER IN THE FIRST SCENE
approaches Phil’s window

POLICEMAN
Do you know how fast you were going

PHIL
I don’t know three five miles
over
(pointing the other way)
That guy was doing at least ninety
You’re missing all the fun all
your friends went that way

POLICEMAN
(staring for a beat)
License and registration sir

Phil hands him the paperwork Waits for a long beat as he
looks over it

PHIL
How long is this gonna take

POLICEMAN
It takes what it takes

PHIL
That’s helpful Thank you It’s
just my wife is in labor

POLICEMAN
Wow Congratulations You figured
out the number one excuse I get
from douchebag speed-demons It’s
amazing how many wives are in labor
on just the day I pull them over

The policeman begins writing a ticket VERY SLOWLY

PHIL
Look Officer I know you have a
job to do and I can respect that
But my wife is about to have a
baby right now I missed the
whole pregnancy because I
couldnt deal with the fact that
she might not be the exact kind of
mother I always imagined I missed
the ultrasounds and feeling the
first kick and running to the
grocery store at three in the
morning because she was craving
pickles I missed it all But I
am not going to miss this

(MORE )

PHIL (CONTD)
So you can either give me the
ticket and let me go or you can
put me in jail but I am not
waiting here another second

SMASH CUT TO

The Policeman handcuffs Phil over the hood of his car

between her legs

OBGYN

Laurie suddenly notices Gaius WHO’S GOT HIS IPHONE TRAINED
ON HER CROTCH FILMING THE ACTION

right now I’m alone here and I’m
trying my best to make this a
beautiful experience

OBGYN
I’m sorry I just want you to be
prepared You’re going to push
like you’re having an enormous
bowel movement And you probably
will empty your bowels And then
youll pass a large amount of
bloody mucus and fluid with an odor
that’s been described as “pungently
rancid” or “goaty” And then as
the baby crowns Ill perform an
episiotomy which is just a fancy
way of saying I’1l use a large
scissors to snip from your vaginal
opening to your anus And then
after all that we’ll clean the
blood mucus and feces off your
baby’s face and you’1ll have your
beautiful experience Okay

Laurie and Gaius look at him horrified Gaius slowly stops
filming and lowers his iPhone

Then Laurie’s phone rings She grabs it

LAURIE

PHIL
You know how they changed some of
the speed limits on the highways

police and various prisoners sitting around him staring
him
