GABRIEL (V0O)
You know the problem with
Hollywood They make shit
Unbelievable unremarkable shit
Im not some grungy filmmaker-
wannabee searching for
existentialism through a haze of
bong-smoke Its easy to pick
apart bad acting short-sighted
directing or the purely moronic
stringing together of words many
of the studios term as prose No
Im talking the lack of realism
Realism Not a pervasive element
in the modern American cinematic
vision

FADE IN
INT STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

Three men sit at a window booth drinking coffee and
talking Two of the men sit on one side of the table
STANLEY is in his early thirties AGENT ROBERTS early
forties Both wear suits the youngers is fairly
expensive and well cut the others is polyester enough
said The MAN across however is quite different He

is what they used to call a cool-cat

GABRIEL (MAN)
Take Dog Day Afternoon for

example Arguably Pacinos
greatest performance excepting
The Godfather Part I and
Scarface of course A
masterpiece of directing easily
Lumets best The acting the
script cinematography all top
notch But they didnt push the
envelope What if in Dog Day
Sonny really wanted to get away
with it What if and heres
where it gets tricky What if
theyd started killing hostages
No mercy no quarter meet our
demands or the cute blonde in the
bell bottoms gets one in the back
of the head bam splatter What
Still no bus

(MORE)

GABRIEL (CONTD)
How many innocent victims would
they let get sprayed across the
windows before the city reversed
its policy on hostage situations
And this was 1976 No CNN no
CNBC no MTV No Internet
Fast forward to the present same
situation Can you imagine the
feeding frenzy of the modern
media In hours it would be the
top story from Boston to Budapest
All caught in 150 millimeter zoom
computer enhanced and color
corrected You would practically
taste the brain matter Six
hostages die Ten Twelve
Twenty Thirty Relentless One
after another All over a bus a
plane and a couple of million
dollars that were federally
insured

He sits letting the pictures sink in then

GABRIEL

Just a thought I mean its not
really within the realm of
conventional cinema but what
if

ROBERTS
You know this movie of yours I
dont think it would have worked

GABRIEL
Really How come

ROBERTS
(shrugs)
Audiences love happy endings

GABRIEL
Pacino escapes With the money
Boyfriend gets the sex change
operation They live happily ever
after

Stanley shakes his head

Stanley shakes his head

GABRIEL
No

STANLEY
No

GABRIEL
Homophobia

STANLEY

Bad guy cant win Its a
morality tale One way or the
other hes gotta go down

GABRIEL
Oh well Life does tend to be
stranger than fiction
(looking at watch)
Well guys gotta jet This place
is kinda dead
CAMERA PANS AROUND the coffee shop Not a soul in the
place We CONTINUE TO PAN AROUND 270 DEGREES TO the
front door which is open Outside the open doorway are
crouched a squad of heavily body-armored SWAT members
packed together and aiming automatic weapons inside

ANGLE ON GABRIEL

GABRIEL
Thanks for the coffee

He gets up In his left hand which has been hidden by
the table until now he is holding a strange-looking
spring-loaded grip Gabriel is looking back at them
Smiles

GABRIEL
Rene Descartes is sitting in some
bar in Paris Bartender says
Hey you want another drink
Descartes says I think not
And disappears

He smiles at his own joke then turns and walks over to
the front door

GABRIEL
Move

No one even twitches

GABRIEL
I wont ask again

He lifts up the device in his left hand

ANGLE ON ROBERTS

who nods his head The SWAT team moves back letting
Gabriel out of the coffee shop

GABRIEL
Thank you
Gabriel looks back at Stan sitting in the booth

GABRIEL
Stanley you coming

Stan slides from the booth as Gabriel exits the coffee
shop --

EXT STARBUCKS COFFEE SHOP - DAY
SILENCE -- no sounds on the SOUNDTRACK

Gabriel and Stanley stop just outside the doorway
Gabriel dons a pair of hip little shades then continues
across the sidewalk and into the street

He nonchalantly looks up Suddenly the THUMP of
HELICOPTERS and the WAIL of SIRENS dominates the
soundtrack

Pandemonium HELICOPTERS RIP the sky LA County PD and
a bunch of news vultures Squad cars block off both ends
of the street while SWAT trucks news vans and looky-
loos are packed together into the distance

Sharpshooters lean out of windows and snipers are
positioned on every open rooftop Hundreds of weapons

are pointed at this man who saunters across the street as
if hes on his way to Sunday service without a care in
the world

Slowly Stanley follows Gabriel into the street

Gabriel steps up on the far sidewalk a huge armored bus
blocks most of the windows He walks beside the bus
under a huge WORLD BANC sign and through the glass
front door which shuts IN OUR FACE

INT BANK - CLOSEUP - GABRIEL - DAY

He turns away from the window and we FOLLOW him

The interior of the bank looks like New Orleans on Fat

Tuesday Three Hummers sit in the middle of the floor

surrounded by broken glass Between them rests a bright
red Ferrari F50 (Gabriels)

All but one of the front windows of the bank the one
with the door in it has been welded over with 34 inch
plate steel

Over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor arms
cable-tied behind their backs Something has been duct-
taped around their chests and each is wearing what
appears to be a dog collar

The other occupants of the room are nine men All of
whom would look as if they were attending the fashion
event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons
each one carries

GABRIEL
How we doin

One of the ARMED MEN finishes putting a collar ona
young normally good-looking-but-now-covered-in-mascara

whimpering blonde girl

MARCO (ARMED MAN)

Done
GABRIEL
Good Take her out
SUPERIMPOSE FRIDAY OCTOBER 18 84122

AXL TORVALDS enters customs A thirty-something European

who could easily pass for a season regular on
Sprockets

We PULL BACK Torvalds is watching anxiously as his bags
are torn into like Christmas day at the Griswalds The
two CUSTOMS AGENTS eye his three laptops suspiciously

TORVALDS
(heavy Finnish
accent)
Please be careful --

-- one of the Agents cuts off his plea with a glance

TORVALDS
(to himself almost
inaudibly)

-- that equipment is quite
expensive

Torvalds is wary of time After several moments his bags
are being repacked when another passport is found

The customs official holds up two passports ANOTHER
CUSTOMS OFFICIAL takes them and walks over to Torvalds

ANOTHER CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
Mr Torvalds Could you step
over here please

Torvalds glances at his watch 145 PM

TORVALDS
How long am I going to be delayed

ANOTHER CUSTOMS OFFICIAL
Itll be just a moment

Torvalds stands to the side while two customs officials
compare his passports They step over to a computer
terminal and punch in some data Its 150 PM

Torvalds notices a customs department employee wheeling a
cart of confiscated items out of a nearby service
elevator He pushes the cart out of the oversized
elevator

Torvalds shoots a glance back to the two officials
discussing his situation

Torvalds casually picks up his computer case and coolly
walks over to the elevator Torvalds walks in just as the doors close

The customs officials conferring look around Torvalds
is gone One of them looks up and sees the numbers
changing above the elevator

The customs officials race up to the escalator to the --

We are indeed in the middle of nowhere no nothing as far
as you can see We CONTINUE TO CRANE UP a 140000
Ferrari Modena flies down the road in a cloud of
suspended gravel toward Stanleys dilapidated piece-o-
crap trailer

EXT TRAILER - ROOF - DAY

Stan stands on the roof of his trailer which was a
dilapidated shack in the 1950s and now is a lot worse A
chained but scruffy-looking Rottweiler runs around in

front of the trailer

Stan looks completely different than he did in the
opening sequence He hasnt taken very good care of
himself His hair is long and right now standing on
end He is wearing nothing but a dirty towel and is
slicing golf balls off the roof Whack

As the Ferrari drives up he begins hitting golf balls at
it but he just isnt very good Nevertheless after a
dozen bad hits a lucky shot ricochets off the aluminum
hood

CLOSEUP - FERRARI HOOD

CLANG

BACK TO SCENE

Stan smiles as the car slides to a halt in the gravel
driveway and turns back to his work

ANGLE ON STANLEY

As we hear the DOOR SHUT and SOMEONE COMES UP the
aluminum extension ladder

A few moments later in SLOW MOTION GINGER appears at
the top of the ladder and steps onto the trailers roof
Stan turns around

She is what the hack writers of the Thirties would call a
vision Thesauruses could be exhausted searching for
adjectives that do her justice

In the low-rent light of Stanleys white trash haven she
is by definition a goddess
STANLEY
Who are you supposed to be

WHACK (slice)
She lights a cigarette inhales deeply then exhales

GINGER

She smiles hands him the club back and pulls down her

skirt
GINGER
You need to straighten your left
arm Youre bending it

He looks at her

GINGER

27 He does and the ball goes flying 200 yards perfect
whacking a fridge with 200 YARDS painted on it CLANG

Stan looks at the club then tosses it to the ground
climbing back down an aluminum extension ladder that
leads up through a makeshift hatch on the roof

INT KITCHEN

She follows but Stan ignores her and walks into his
bedroom

She walks over opens and reaches into the fridge --

carcasses Roberts eases quietly into the room in mid-

steaming coffee and with one finger pushes it over into
the lawyers lap

ROBERTS

great pain)
Goddammit

Roberts grabs him by the collar and slams him into the
wall then pushes him out the door with a kick in the
ass He grabs the briefcase and tosses it out after him
and locks the door

He turns on Torvalds smacking him across the face He
pushes him into the wall and holds his badge in front of
him

INT PRAGUE NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT

A huge lavish converted theater in downtown Los
Angeles A 21st Century version of 54 on equal overdoses
of steroids and acid

INT VIP SECTION - NIGHT

private booths in small rooms around the perimeter The
rooms have the ability to be closed off by drawing huge
thick velvet drapes

STANLEY

They walk into one of the booths in the back Sitting
around a large oval table is our antihero Gabriel
Shear surrounded by a handful of his crew and a gaggle
of beautiful model-types

Ginger kisses Gabriel and with a healthy exchange of
fluids then

Stanley sits down Gabriel pours Stan a glass of Crown

GABRIEL

young hacker who made a virus that
broke the FBIs Carnivore
program that was actively reading
every subscribers E-mail and
scrambled the systems He did
what the federal judges wouldnt
do and kept the government out of

Carnivore program is back in full
swing It was a real tragedy

Gabriel smiles
The beautiful WOMAN to Stanleys right slides closer
HELGA (WOMAN)
(heavily accented)

Hi Stanley

Stanley looks at her shes a knockout artificially
perfect He looks back at Gabriel

STANLEY

patience for this --

GABRIEL

closer to him

GABRIEL
Take a look at this

He is handed an open laptop it glows He sets it on the
table and spins it around in front of Stanley

STANLEY
(like an alcoholic
faced with a fifth
of tequila)
You know I cant touch that

Helga pours a shot of tequila

HELGA
You like tequila Stanley

Helga shoots the tequila then turns to Stanley places
her lips against his The gold liquid drips from their
lips as she spits it into Stanleys mouth

He pushes her away breaking the liplock and swallowing
the tequila She licks it from his face

The drapes close Two of Gabriels crew step out Marco

used silencer onto the end Marco walks around behind

Stanley
STANLEY

Helga smiles then drops her head into Stanleys lap We

hear his PANTS UNZIP

GABRIEL

GABRIEL

sixty minutes Unfortunately
I need someone who can do it in

STANLEY

GABRIEL
Fraid not

Stan realizes now no one is smiling He grabs the blonde
by the hair but cant pull her up

GABRIEL
Forty-five seconds Time is a
wasting big guy

The silencer is pressed into the back of his head
Stanley tries to focus on the screen Stanley sucks air
through his teeth trying to focus

GABRIEL
You have thirty seconds Stanley Stanley gives up on trying to get her up and his hands
start flying over the keyboard We INTERCUT the ACTION
WITH a CLOSEUP of Stanleys hands working the keyboard
and a CLOSEUP of Gabriel and a CLOSEUP of the LCD screen
which reads in flashing red letters --

INT CLUB - REST ROOM - NIGHT

Stanley pushes into the bathroom He kicks the
wastebasket across the room

STANLEY
Shit

He pushes a club kid out of the way of the sink He
turns on the water and washes his face Slowly he leans
his forehead against the mirror Ginger appears behind
him

STANLEY
What are you looking at

GINGER
Relax Stanley You can do this

STANLEY
Get away from me

GINGER
I want to help you

STANLEY
Help Help what squeegee my

brain off the ceiling

GINGER

It was just a test Stan you

Ginger pulls out a cigarette and a lighter from her
plastic overcoat

STANLEY
A test I dont know why I let
you talk me into this I cant
believe how desperate I am

She exhales toward Stanley

GINGER
I thought you were here saving
your daughter Stanley

He turns around

STANLEY

(pissed)
Look Id do anything to get
Holly back But if I end up ina
box or back in jail then I really
cant help her can I What I

back to court

GINGER

Back to court Back to Melissas

grand at her shell throw five
back at you Its not about
Holly its about beating you
You know that Think Stanley

STANLEY
What Im thinking about is that
youre willing to put a gun to my
head to see if I can hack --

Suddenly three club kids come busting into the bathroom

55 Ginger interrupts him by slamming Stan between the

urinals and ramming her tongue into his mouth with the
kind of wet aggressive action that takes a movie from

PG-13 to an R

When the kids realize that the urinals are occupied
leave Slowly Ginger takes her tongue out of Stans
mouth They look at each other She smiles at him

GINGER
(coyly)
Sorry

A beat for a moment there exists something between them

then bam shes all business again

GINGER
So let me sum it up for you

Youre a felon working a dead-
end job You want to get Holly

As he realizes shes right hes got nothing to lose

Slam He smacks the mirror with his fist then walks out

of the rest room Ginger slowly lifts the cigarette
She exhales then slowly smiles Shes got him

EXT PRAGUE VALET - NIGHT

ROBERTS

FBI COMPUTER GEEK 1

EXT GABRIELS HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT
The house is at the very top of the hills and the pool
hangs off the side of the cliff way below the house

The outer edge appears nonexistent like the water hangs
frozen in air
A very hip but very nasty soiree is in progress More
Ibiza than Hollywood Hills

Stanley sits in a chair beside a pool containing a half-
dozen beautiful un-clad model-types

Gabriel is mingling through the crowd

CLOSEUP - STANLEY

Stanley stares off into the glittering lights of LA
WIDEN

GABRIEL
(smiles)
So Stan tell me Howd you do
it
STANLEY
Do what
GABRIEL

Break the code At the club

You broke the entire encryption a
silencer against your eye and your
cock in someones mouth all in
less than sixty seconds How

STANLEY
I used a logic bomb dropped it
through the trap door --

GINGER
No you didnt You didnt have
time

GABRIEL

Cmon you can do better than
that Howd you do it

STANLEY
I used a password sniffer

Gabriel glances at Ginger who shakes her head

GINGER
Uh uh

STANLEY
Yes I did --

GABRIEL
Cmon Stanley Howd-you-do-it

STANLEY
I dont know exactly I see the
numbers In my head All my
life I dont answer equations I
just see the answers Same with
code I cant explain ---

Ginger eases over to where Stan is sitting She runs her
hands across his shoulders as she moves around him
dancing to the MUSIC

GINGER
Mozart always said he didnt write
music he just wrote down what he
heard in his head So did
Faulkner just with words

GABRIEL

(drinking wine)
You definitely have a gift Stan
The most powerful people on the
planet are like you With a laptop
and a phone line you can make God
look like a thirteen-year-old
with a stack of Playboys and a
lack of imagination

(beat)
Cmere Stan let me show you
something

INT GABRIELS LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Stanley and Gabriel stand in Gabriels primo designed
pad staring at an array of supercomputers

Stanley stands in front of the six huge flat panels
linked together in complete awe

GABRIEL
Pretty impressive huh

(beat)
So

STANLEY
So

59

GABRIEL
Heres the deal I need a worm
Stanley A hydra actually A
multi-headed worm to break an
encryption and then sniff out
latent digital footprints
throughout an encrypted network

STANLEY
What kind of cypher

GABRIEL
Vernam encryption

STANLEY
A Vernams impossible Its key
code is destroyed upon
implementation Not to mention
being a true 128 bit encryption

GABRIEL
Actually were talking 512 bit

STANLEY
Its impossible

GABRIEL
Tell ya what Ill pay you ten
million dollars That should be
enough to get your daughter back
(beat)
unless of course its impossible

Stan thinks about it

STANLEY
Nothings impossible

They shake hands and Gabriel heads toward the back of the
house

LONG SHOT - GABRIEL
walking up the stairs toward his room
Stan looks over to see Ginger staring at him

STANLEY

Ginger pulls herself up on the desk spreading her legs
on either side of the keyboard

( )

GINGER
Cmon Stan Lets get to work
She turns on the computers He backs away
GINGER
It wont bite you I promise
STANLEY
I dont know Its gonna be
pretty hard without a gun to my
head
She reaches out and pulls him to her
GINGER
Well lets put a gun to your
head
She kisses him and slowly he responds She smiles
GINGER

Tell me about your worm Stanley
They kiss

GINGER
You surprised that a girl with
real breasts and an I1Q over 70
can give you a hard-on

Stan shakes his head

STANLEY
I thought you were Gabriels

She looks at him a moment She smiles at him and slowly
bends forward to whisper in his ear
CLOSEUP - GINGERS MOUTH
at Stanleys ear
GINGER
(very slowly)
I am not what you think I am

ANGLE ON GINGER AND STANLEY

As she leans back She stares at him a moment then
slides off the desk GINGER
Youre a smart guy Stanley You
figure me out

She hands him the bottle of expensive wine shes been
drinking and then grabbing Stan by the belt-buckle
pulls him casually behind her toward the pool house

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN

EXT POOL - DAY

Lounging by the pool is none other than our heroine
Ginger topless wearing nothing more than tiny oblong
green-tinted shades a skimpy T-back and a little silver
ring through her left nipple Shes reading Steven
Hawkings A Brief History of Time A shadow falls over
her

The shadow moves Ginger glances nonchalantly up then

GINGER
(sitting up
grinning)
Dont you have that just-fucked-
the-neighbors-cat look this
morning

She reaches over lights a cigarette and inhales deeply
He smiles looking her up and down

GINGER
Problem

STANLEY
Pretty impressive

GINGER
I thought we went over all that
last night

STANLEY
(beat then like
stupid)
The book Ginger

GINGER
Ohhh
(holding it out)
Look no pictures Get out of my
light

( )

They stare at each sharing a moment of God-only-knows-
what then both break into smiles like two giddy seventh-
graders at the local skating rink
Stanley nervously clears his throat Shes got him

STANLEY

Can I borrow your car Theres

something I need to do

She reaches down beside the chair grabs her keys and
tosses them to him Then

GINGER
If youre going to see your
daughter you might want to
reevaluate the way you look
(goes back to
her book)
Just a thought

He looks at her with open mouth amazement In just 24
hours she already knows what makes him tick

She looks up from her book and winks at him then returns
to her reading

EXT NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY

A SCHOOL BELL RINGS and three hundred screaming kids of
all ages come running from the doors

ANGLE ON HOLLY

Not your average ten-year-old Even decked out in bell-
bottoms and sandals there is something about the way she
carries herself that is older wiser sadder

She walks into a CLOSEUP and scans the driveway
Reflected in her tiny round lavender shades we see the
circular driveway of the school jam-packed with buses and
parental types in their M-series Mercedes and their Lexus
SUVs She sighs We CRANE UP PANNING LEFT

Holly walks to the edge of the street oblivious to the
mayhem She looks up and down the street then slowly
drops her backpack and sits down on the curb She pulls

a well-worn copy of William Gibsons Neuromancer from her
backpack and turns up the raging ELECTRONICA from her
WALKMAN

DISSOLVE TO

SAME SCENE - LATER
Now there is much less pandemonium No more buses We
CRANE DOWN TO a MEDIUM of Holly still in the exact same
spot Holly sighs pulls back her headphones and grabs

her StarTac from her backpack She opens the phone and
dials

INT MALIBU HOUSE - DAY 63

The PHONE RINGS and we PAN AROUND the seemingly empty
house finally COMING TO REST ON the back of the couch
We JIB UP and TILT DOWN Melissa is passed out in a pool
of her own drool The PHONE continues to RING

EXT NEWTON MONTESSORI SCHOOL - DAY 64

Holly hits the phone and then presses speed dial We see
Yellow Cab scroll across the phone She hits SEND

MAN (0S)
Can I give you a lift

HOLLY
Look creep I dont think so --

She stands up ready for a fight And there next to her
is her father transformed Under his arm is a three-
foot-tall stuffed giraffe wrapped with a big red bow

HOLLY
Daddy
(recognition)

Daddy
She runs to him and wraps her arms around him

STANLEY
Hey sweetheart

HOLLY
Daddy What are you doing here
I missed you so much

STANLEY
Me too baby I brought you
something

He holds the stuffed giraffe to her

HOLLY
Oh Daddy If Mom finds out
youre here shes gonna have you
thrown back in jail

STANLEY

Its okay baby Let me give you
a ride home

He grabs her stuff

STANLEY
Cmon

He walks toward Gingers silver Mercedes CLK which hes
borrowing Holly runs and jumps on his back They laugh
as he carries her to the car

EXT MALIBU HOUSE - DAY 65

They sit in the CLK parked down the street from Hollys
house

STANLEY
You believe in me right

HOLLY
Of course but --

STANLEY
Ive found a way to get you back
sweetheart Its my one shot and
Im taking it Just give me a
couple of days

HOLLY
(crying)
I dont want anything else to
happen to you Dad

STANLEY
Holly everythings going to be
okay You just have to trust me

HOLLY
(crying)
I love you Daddy

Holly quickly kisses him jumps out and runs crying
from the car at full speed with the giraffe

Stanley tears rolling down his face slaps the steering
wheel trying to figure out how he screwed up his life so

badly

Suddenly the passenger door opens and a man in a DARK

BLUE SUIT and fed-issued shades gets in

STANLEY
Who the fuck are you
DARK SUIT 1
(flipping out
his badge)
Friend of a friend Lets take a
ride

He motions toward a black Taurus now parked across the
street In the back he sees a face he recognizes

65

CLOSEUP ON ROBERTS

BACK TO STAN

STANLEY
Shit

The man kinda smiles at Stan
DARK SUIT 1
(being a dick)
Gotta suck to be you

STANLEY
Yep

Stanley whacks the fed with his elbow across the bridge

of his nose and jumps out of the car

INT TAURUS

Stan runs across the hood of the Taurus and just jumps

over the railing

EXT SHEER CLIFF - DAY 66
We realize what Stan did probably wasnt the smartest

move in the world The cliff is just barely on this side
of 90 degrees and drops off about five hundred yards

straight down to the PCH

Stan falls in SLOW MOTION about thirty feet before the
cliff face angles out enough to break his fall He begins
a combination of sliding and tumbling down the bluff

EXT MALIBU HOUSE (STREET) - DAY 67

Roberts runs to the railing and sees Stanley sliding
falling down the hill

67
ROBERTS
(to his men)
Cut him off at the bottom

Roberts then hops the railing as his men scramble for
the car
EXT SHEER CLIFF - DAY 68
Roberts hangs in mid-air a moment then he too begins the
rolling fall down the hill

ANGLE ON STANLEY

as he tries to keep his balance is being beaten and
battered by the sharp rocky ground

Finally he shoots off an outcropping and free-falls for
fifteen feet Then it really gets bad

Clear plastic sheeting has been stretched across the hill
to help control the erosion To Stanley however it is
the worlds largest Slip and Slide

He is no longer able to control even badly his descent
Now he is flying down the cliff face only the rocks and
bushes that slam into his body slows the descent

Roberts above him is doing little better

LONG SHOT ON CLIFF FACE

As Stan and Roberts slide toward the eight lanes of
blazing afternoon traffic on the PCH

Finally Stan bounces onto the black-top road He runs
headlong into the traffic

CARS SCREECH HORNS BLARING as they slide into each
other Stanley does not lose the single-minded focus of
escaping

Roberts now at the bottom himself watches as a CAR
SLIDES sideways into Stan flipping him over it Stan
not stopping to feel the pain runs across the hood of a
freshly-stopped car

EXT BEACH - DAY 69

On the other side Stan runs down to the beach and runs
down the sand at full-tilt looking for any escape route
Roberts has made up some time due to the auto-pedestrian
accident which slowed him down a little Stan however is
faster

Stan does his best Jerry Rice as he runs down the beach
at full speed

Suddenly the Taurus comes tearing-ass across the beach
at Stanley Stan veers now running through the surf
The Taurus veers as well and Stan is forced to slide
across the hood to keep from getting whacked The Taurus
breaks left and slides further into the surf

The FBI driver hits the accelerator and bogs the Taurus
down tires spinning throwing sand Stan continues to
run as Roberts makes it to the Taurus

ROBERTS
Fuck this

He pulls his 40 CAL from his shoulder holster and FIRES
it into the air Roberts bends over trying to catch his
breath

Stanley stops putting his hands up
DARK SUIT 2

Why didnt you do that earlier
sir

Roberts looks at the agent

DARK SUIT 2
Sorry sir

ROBERTS
Go get him

Three of the agents bring Stanley over
Stan slides down by the back wheel

ROBERTS
What are you doing in LA Stan

STANLEY
(catching his
breath)
Vacationing

ROBERTS
Why were you running We just
wanted to talk

STANLEY
Are you arresting me

ROBERTS
For violating your parole by
leaving Texas without permission
or for evading a federal agent and
almost getting me killed in the
process

Stan just looks at him

ROBERTS
No Im not

STANLEY
Then why are we talking

ROBERTS
Didnt know the court lifted the
sanction preventing you from

seeing your daughter

STANLEY
Fuck you

ROBERTS
You just want to cut through the
pleasantries and get down to
business Fine I can help you
with your daughter Stan Help
me Ill help you

STANLEY
Youll have to forgive me the
fact that you put me in jail for
18 months doesnt inspire a lot of
trust

ROBERTS
Whether I agreed with what you did
or not you broke the law
Stanley

STANLEY
I guess we were both doing what we
had to This was a nice trip down
memory lane but if youre not
arresting me

ROBERTS
So why was it you are in LA
again

STANLEY
I told you --

ROBERTS
-- vacationing Thats right Ya
know its funny Axl Torvalds was
just here for a vacation too
Isnt it odd that the two best
hackers in the world are here at
the same time

STANLEY

Im a sucker for Disneyland
(getting up)
Tell Torvalds I said hello

ROBERTS
If youre not careful you can tell
him yourself Hes dead

Stanley looks at Roberts

ROBERTS
(to his men)
Give him a card

They do Stan looks at it

ROBERTS
In case you think of anything else
you want to tell me

Stan turns to walk off

STANLEY
(to the agent
he elbowed)
Sorry about your nose

ROBERTS
Hey Stan

Stan turns

ROBERTS
You know youre in way over your
head here

69 STANLEY
(walking off)
I know

ROBERTS
Its a long walk back up the hill

Stan lifts his middle finger behind him and begins the
long journey back up the hill Roberts collapses into
the passenger seat

ROBERTS
Follow him

the dresser and takes off her earrings Then she reaches
under her dress and unVelcros the modified 10mm Glock
and its thigh holster dropping it on the dresser She
then pulls off the hip little designer dress she is
wearing revealing the fact that she is wearing a tiny
transmitting receiver taped between her breasts

She stares at herself in the mirror for a moment then
slowly starts to untape the bug

STANLEY (0S)
I have to hand it to you Ginger
You look good wearing anything

Ginger grabs her Glock and spins around the holster
dropping away with the touch of a button

She levels it on the dark corner of the room where

expensive wine

-- In the early Eighties the
DEA set up a network of dummy

corporations as a government front
to launder drug money and gather
evidence Problem is the front
companies started making money
Lots of money By 1986 when
Operation Swordfish was
terminated there was close to 400
million dollars in the DEAs
accounts

Before we can tap into the secure

the banks on the backbone of this

banks there are in the US It
could take years

pulls up closing off the alley He slides to a stop and
slams it into reverse Backwards at 60-plus miles per

Hold the wheel

Gabriel reaches in the passenger floorboard and pulls up
a duffel bag He unzips it and withdraws what the
Marines call a SAW -- a Belgian-designed machine gun
compact but with 1500 rounds of Swiss cheese action per

minute powerful enough for the US to replace the M-60

blocked them in The one from the other side and a third
comes toward them down the alley

box wrapped in white tape and printed with AP He clips
it and pulls back the bolt He grabs the wheel from
