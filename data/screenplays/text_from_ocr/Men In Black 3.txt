MEN IN BLACK 3

Written by

Etan Cohen and Lowell Cunningham

CLOSE ON A PAIR OF MIRROR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES

Standard issue throughout the south to abusive racist

prison

guards
Widen to reveal that indeed these glasses are on the
sneering face of just such a man
We follow the guard
DOWN A DINGY PRISON HALLWAY
Paint peeling off the rusty bars Somewhere someone is
playing harmonica Prisoners yell complaints as he passes
He meets them all with--

GUARD
Shut up convict Get yer hands
off the bars
The guard passes through several levels of security doors
deeper and deeper into the more secure bowels of the prison
home of the scum of the scum
Meanwhile
PRISON VISITING ROOM
The lazy-ass guards in charge of screening visitors read
magazines watch TV Footsteps -- someones here Which
pisses them off because that means they actually have to do
their jobs
The unseen visitor buzzes for help They take their time
getting off their asses When they finally look up their
gaze becomes a leer Follow it to
DEVIL GIRL the visitor Too tall too muscled but hot if
youre into that kind of thing -- an R Crumb drawing come

to

life
She holds a CAKE -- the cutest perfectly-frosted pink cake
right off the cover of the Betty Crocker cookbook

GUARD 2
Lookie here Yazs visitor I
guess even a turd gets flies to
land on it

GUARD 3
Me I like a big girl

They smirk hoping for a reaction Devil girl emits a low
sinister growl like an angry Doberman The guards look at

each other and GET DOWN TO BUSINESS

GUARD 2
ID visitation papers

BACK DOWN THE HALLWAY WITH THE GUARD

He reaches the end of the hallway The biggest most
absurdly-reinforced double security door He punches in a
code

The giant door retracts -- its immense weight has it
squeaking and groaning the whole way Whoevers behind this
thing mustve done something REAL bad

WITH DEVIL GIRL

Going through the metal detectors waved over with security
wands The guards are being thorough Maybe more thorough
than they need to be They check everything -- even the
cake The digital readout tells them NO METAL DETECTED

GUARD 3

Shes clean Well not CLEAN but
you know

They laugh buzz her through

WITH THE GUARD
The giant door finally opens he continues to the end of the
hallway Stops in front of a cell Yells in

GUARD
Hey Yaz You got a visitor
looks

the

Lets go pretty boy

VISITING ROOM
Spare Just a table and chairs in the middle -- poured
concrete Nothing a convict could say smash into the face
of a guard
The perimeter of the room is lined with armed guards --

like theyre not taking chances

At the lone table -- Devil Girl waits with her cake She
hears the door open -- her face lights up as IN STEPS HER

BELOVED --
YAZ an evil hippiebiker badass right out of Easy Rider A
huge mane of hair a big handlebar moustache that frames a
grubby unshaven face
Everything about him seems strangely independently alive --
every strand of hair every fringe on his dirty jacket --

way Elvis was in his prime

He wears a distinctive SKULL PINKIE RING A smirk plays on
his mouth that says -- Im smarter than you asshole

The guards escort Yaz who can barely walk in his CHAINS and
MANACLES They dump him into one of the chairs Devil Girl
jumps up they lock in a kiss -- it goes on too long

A guard pokes them with his billy club --

GUARD 2
This aint a conjugal visit
quit yer conjugating

YAZ
Whens the last time you conjugated
anything

DEVIL GIRL

I brought you a cake

YAZ
Thanks darling

(TO GUARDS)
Hey could you cut this up for us

Its our anniversary Im romantic

like that

A guard picks up the cake Smirks and takes a dirty three-
fingered scoop of frosting

GUARD 2

(MOUTH FULL)
Not great She mustbe good at
somethin else
They all LAUGH He goes back for another scoop

YAZ
I wouldnt do that

GUARD 2
Whys that convict

GUARD POV
Where he scraped away the frosting REVEAL A HORRIBLE ALIEN

MOUTH

GUARD 2 (CONTD)

WHAT TH--
But in a flash the mouth SPRINGS OUT -- IT BELONGS TO A
VORACIOUS ALIEN -- another springs out behind it -- they

consume the guards entire face

YAZ
Thats why
The aliens jump into Yazs hands like a matching pair of
grotesque ORGANIC SIDEARMS -- as vicious and bloodthirsty as
their master snarling and hungry for blood
The guards draw their weapons but YAZ IS FASTER-- he
launches his aliens taking them all out
Yaz holsters the aliens and

THE PRISON BREAK IS ON
One guard badly wounded crawls to SOUND THE ALARM
In the reflection of a pair of blood-spattered aviator
glasses -- Devil Girl puts the guard down with his own
weapon

She uses one of the cake-aliens like a saw to get Yaz out of
his chains

YAZ
Theres nothing sexier than a girl
killing for me

She runs a hand over his bicep

DEVIL GIRL
You got so strong in prison

Yaz notices the almost-dead guard

YAZ
Im not just a man of brute force
you know I prefer to be known for
my rapier wit--
His tongue SHOOTS OUT OF HIS MOUTH -- like a rapier --
impaling the guard--

YAZ (CONTD)
--and tongue
The tongue retracts -- he and Devil Girl KISS
They collect weapons off the guards and use the aliens to

saw
open the door
YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL ESCAPE
Prisoners go nuts guards scramble -- smoke screaming
chaos
Yaz and Devil Girl armed with weapons they took off the
dead
guards BLAST THEIR WAY OUT
Hes a sociopathic badass and shes no slouch either
Along the way Yaz shoots the door off the armory and grabs
an armload of weapons -- Shotguns pistols and a Rocket-

Propelled grenade (RPG)
He uses and discards them as he goes
They head for the front gate and FREEDOM

But
They turn the corner and find 50 GUARDS in FULL RIOT GEAR --
Plexiglass shields helmets shotguns -- all aimed at Yaz

All Yaz has left is his RPG

GUARD ON MEGAPHONE
Give it up Yaz Theres no way

out

A beat of stand-off -- Yaz and Devil girl facing off against
the 50 Guards No one blinking

Prisoners watching whats gonna go down

GUARD
You cant win Youve only got one
shot in there
Yaz lets the tension linger -- he seems to enjoy it The
guards SWELTER in their heavy riot gear

YAZ
You look hot Mind if I open a
window

The guards share a look - huh Yaz grins turns his RPG
towards the wall behind the guards The guards faces go

WIDE WITH TERROR

GUARD
Hey Whoa What are you doing
Dont do that

SLAM

Yaz blasts a hole in the wall -- the guards are IMMEDIATELY
SUCKED OUT like from a hole blown in an airplane

What the

Yaz steps through the hole

ON YAZ
As he and Devil girl step through the hole take a deep
satisfied breath of FREEDOM
Reveal we are on
THE SURFACE OF THE MOON
The signage on the prison reads INTERGALACTIC DEPARTMENT OF

CORRECTIONS LUNAR DIVISION

Yaz looks up at the BLUE MARBLE OF EARTH smiles

As Yaz fixes his gaze on our planet his hair his fringes
INDEPENDENTLY ARTICULATE YAZS MALEVOLENT EMOTIONS they
also seem drawn here Like bees they express a collective
intelligence

YAZ
Im coming for you
Following Yazs gaze to the Earth we launch into

CREDITS
MiB credits fly us through the Galaxy
Ending on a PARTICULARLY INHOSPITABLE LOOKING PLANET
As it revolves we observe its strange craters and surface
where steaming fissures belch geysers of noxious gases

KAYS VOICE (V0)

When you really think about it the
universe is a pretty awful place

Full of danger brutality and ten
million kinds of scum So the

trick is to find one or two things

that make life in this cesspool

worth living

And reveal we are actually looking at

PEKING DUCK
Rotating on a spit
JAY and KAY watch this awful duck rotate

JAY
That That nasty greasy thing
makes your life worth living
Theres people eating here younger
than that duck

KAY
I was talking about the noodles
or

Best noodles in town
And we are in

INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - CHINATOWN NYC - NIGHT

Tanks everywhere filled with strange fish An eclectic NY

crowd eats -- Wall Street guys hipsters

a Chinese family

two a couple of NYU professor types who love the

authenticity of this place

KAY
Come to think of it Why is Wu

JAY

Because its about to go down
Wu at the door closes the blinds He catches them looking

MR WU

Sorry guys

Wu leaves quickly pulling the door behind him The guys
reach for their weapons

And IT GOES DOWN --

Its a SET-UP and everyone in the restaurant is in on it --

The hipsters the families the wall street guys -- all draw
various forms of ALIEN WEAPONS and ATTACK
Its like a close-quarters Mafia hit -- everyone pumping

truckloads of ordnance at each other Close hand-to-hand
combat Someone wants Jay and Kay dead and theyre not
taking any chances

Right ahead of the onslaught JAY GIVES KAY A HAND SIGNAL --
He nods and they dive in opposite directions SAVING

THEMSELVES FROM GETTING HIT

But not for long

An explosive lands between them --

Kay gets BLOWN OUT THE FRONT WINDOW rolls to a stop in the
middle of the

DESERTED STREET

Silhouetted at the top of the block -- a biker on a
motorcycle As he pulls into the light -- YAZI

Kays eyes go wide with recognition
Yaz grins a murderous grin
YAZ
Some things are worth waiting for

KAY
Then come get it you worthless

PIECE OF--
Yaz guns the engine and BEARS DOWN ON KAY

INSIDE WITH JAY

Getting the worst of it

A messy battle THROUGH THE KITCHEN

The Giant fishs tank gets shot -- the FISH IS FREE And he
goes RIGHT AFTER JAY

JAY
You probably took that whole
catfish thing the wrong way --
The fish SNARLS AFTER HIM -- lunges and BITES

JAY (CONTD)

squirting hot sauce -- working like a lion tamer to keep it

KAY

YAZ

faces when you see them
Puts the barrel in Kays face and BOOM
Yaz goes up in a GIANT EXPLOSION
Reveal Jay just fired the shot
Jay looks like total hell beaten up covered with 8 kinds

slime and alien guts
He stumbles over to Kay who in contrast looks perfectly
pressed

JAY
So I was thinking about making a
chart for each time I save your
ass And when I do it ten times
you buy me lunch
Canal

Kay lets out a long weary sigh

KAY
Will you settle for a drink

INT DESTROYED CHINESE RESTAURANT

Kay reaches behind the counter for a couple of beers
on his phone
JAY

corner of Canal and Mott And

Follow Jays gaze -- the giant fish flops its way down

load Turns his attention to the clean up crew

spleen on that car

CLEANUP GUY

DARK ALLEY
A glow of a cigarette illuminates the face of Devil Girl
She reaches down We see -- a finger with the distinctive

Skull inching its way along the road

DEVIL GIRL

BOWLING ALLEY - LATER THAT NIGHT
A sign says CLOSED FOR LEAGUE NIGHT
We follow a couple normal-looking BOWLERS into

INT BOWLING ALLEY
Safely inside the Bowlers remove their heads -- which

their bowling balls

Its the LEAGUE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME -- ALIENS VS MIB AGENTS
MiB agents and aliens say hi exchange trash-talk

We see shots of games in progress

An alien rolls a ball -- when it gets to the end of the

it sticks out arms taking down all the pins

The aliens cheer slap tentacles clink beers and swallow
them whole A many-armed alien re-sets the pins

A giant alien with perfect dainty form approaches the foul
line and -- gutter ball He gets mad and shoots the pins
with his laser-eyes

We end up with JAY AND THE MIB TEAM NOT BOWLING BECAUSE
THEYRE WAITING FOR KAY --
Zed paces wearing way too much bowling regalia

ZED
Wheres Kay We either roll or
forfeit -- and I didnt put this on
to forfeit

JAY

Alright Bowling Robot do what we

built you for

Reveal an incredibly high-tech robot wearing one of those
white trash T-shirts that reads 10 reasons why Bowling is
better than Women

ROBOT

(ROBOT VOICE)
This is my time to shine
Robot fires a ball directly down into the floor An awkward
beat as we hear the ball puncture four floors Then a car
alarm

ROBOT (CONTD)
There goes my perfect game

(ROBOT LAUGH)

Ha ha ha

JAY
Guess its on me
Jay rolls -- perfect spin -- Jay watches willing it towards
the pins -- which SCRAMBLE OUT OF THE WAY But Jays roll is
too good -- it spins from fleeing pin to fleeing pin -- a
STRIKE

Jay and his teammates triumphant The frame of a lifetime
Jay looks around --

JAY (CONTD)

Of course -- the one time Kay isnt
here

work

MIB HQ - TUNNEL VENT ROOM

Jay enters -- looks a little worse for wear like somebody
who did some celebrating last night

We see why -- when he hoists his GIANT RIDICULOUS MIB

Jay works his way to his desk
Kays already at his own adjacent desk -- bent over his

Jay opens the YAZ file and pulls out a picture of KAY

But

Jay stares at the photo --- in it we notice Kay is NOW

WEARING A STRANGE MEDALLION

He runs by people dealing with the world coming to an end

COMPUTER (V0)
Nine minutes to impact I always

On the microwave -- it beeps plaintively
Jay runs off with purpose

STREETS OF NYC
July in the city A perfect summer day Kids eat ice cream
Old ladies head to matinees The streets of New York team

with humanity blissfully unaware that they are about to
die

In other words a Tuesday

Jay runs through Time Square where guys sell stuff on

blankets

Desperately looking for someone

Among the sellers a suspicious-looking guy wearing a
strange

mixture of anachronistic clothing -- tri-cornered hat

As soon as he sees Jay his eyes go wide and HE FLEES

Jay grabs something off the blanket and smacks him -- lays

him out

JAY

Trevor opens a Voice Recorder app

TREVOR

(INTO PHONE)
Trevors last words Dear
posterity Should anyone find
this let history remember that
Trevor was a man of noble bearing
quiet dignity --

(IMPACT )

And the world is vapor

EVERYTHING GOES WHITE

WHITE
Pure white
Jay comes to groggy like he has the worst hangover of all
time brain bigger than his skull trying to make his eyes
focus
Trying to make sense of his strange blinding white
environment -- Is this the afterlife
The reverie disrupted by a TOILET FLUSH
The white resolves into

INT BATHROOM

Jay realizes hes in a mens room sitting in a urinal The
music transitions Whatever hip-hop featuring a 60s sample
was playing in the Apple store -- now continues as the 60s
song itself played over a tinny portable radio

He hops up just as a young white office worker comes out of
one of the stalls washes his hands and flips Jay a
quarter
can

Jay stares at it a beat confused Misreading his confusion
the office worker awkwardly digs out another quarter

OFFICE WORKER
What the heck youre doing a great
job
The kid leaves
Jay ventures out of the bathroom and finds himself in

INT HIGH 60S OFFICE
White guys on IBM Selectric typewriters as far as the eye

see -- like the office in the Apartment
Jay stops in his tracks taking in the 1969-ness of it all
An officious guy annoyed runs up--

OFFICIOUS GUY
Youre late Wheres Mr Watkins
lunch

JAY
OH--

OFFICIOUS GUY
Did his girl not put in the order
The officious guy glares at the girl -- in her 60s

OFFICIOUS GUY (CONTD)
(shoves a bill in Jays

HAND)
Run down to Woolworths -- Two
hamburger sandwiches fries egg
cream and a pack of luckies If
youre back in half an hour you
can keep the change
Jay looks at the SINGLE DOLLAR BILL

OFFICIOUS GUY (CONTD)
On the double OK
at

JAY
Yeah
Jays moves to the elevator waits for it Pockets the
profits of the racist misunderstandings
Elevator opens the elevator operator opens the door -- Jay
climbs in with a car full of older executives
Jay shakes his head just taking this all in

JAY (CONTD)
Wow 1969 Youre all dead now
Just as the elevators about to close a leggy blonde tosses
him a set of keys

BLONDE
The Big Man wants his caddy Chop-
chop
The doors close

EXT PARKING LOT NEXT DOOR

Jays got the keys He looks at the parking tag walks down
a row of beautiful classic cars looking for the right car -

stops and smiles

THE BIG MANS CADDY - JAY DRIVING

Reveal Jay cruising in the most gorgeous 1964 Coupe deVille
convertible Fins chrome a thing of beauty

From the seat next to him -- a fedora He puts it on
completing the look

In the background we notice the Leggy Blond getting yelled

by the guy who must be The Big Man Jay HONKS and waves --

Jay finds some classic 60s music and enjoys himself for a
minute -- a sweet ride through 60s New York

A GREAT 1969 HIT -- THE TEMPTATIONS Cant Get Next to You

comes on the radio Jay is swept up in the music and soon is

SINGING ALONG AT FULL BLAST
At a light he pulls even with an older Brooklyn Italian
couple They give him a disapproving look The woman
clutches her pearls just a little more protectively
He smiles and leans towards them

JAY

Guess what Black president
He laughs and drives off
Pulls up at

EXT MIB HQ ENTRANCEVENTILATION BUILDING

fq

The secret entrance to MiB HQ familiar from the first

movie

Jay strides up to the entrance and cant open the door

Bangs on the door -- nothing Shaking the knob calling to

VOICE (0S)

EXT NEW JERSEY STATE PARKWAY

We hear the way-too-loud death-rattle exhaust note of what

sounds like ten Harleys at once

Reveal -- Yaz the nightmare biker looking like Dennis

Hopper meets Satan riding a badass custom skull-themed rig

that might have dropped out of the brain of Stanley Mouse

His skull ring gleams on his pinkie Devil Girl sits behind

him hands on his shoulders

We ride with them a beat tearing down the highway

They STOP AT A LIGHT -- even with a brightly-painted
microbus

full of hippies

One of the hippies leans out --

HIPPIE
Hey you guys like to party Care
to make a trade for the mama
Yaz pulls out his alien guns The stoned hippie smiles
serenely and puts a flower in one of the mouths Makes a
peace sign

HIPPIE (CONTD)
Make love not war

Yaz fires the alien -- it launches into the microbus --
followed by its brother

The microbus rocks hippies scream the bus dents from the
inside-out On a bumper sticker If This Vans a-rockin
dont come a knockin

The guns finished return to Yaz

Yaz surveys the carnage picks up a medallion off one of the
hippies But looking at it more closely frowns and throws
it away

The head back on their way Blood drips over the Ass Gas
or Grass bumper sticker

We dissolve from the blood to a deep red STRAWBERRY SUNDAE
Widen to reveal we are in

INT HORN AND HARDARTS

A great NYC automat

The kind of place you go when you like to be alone

Loners and weirdos populate the tables minding their own
business Immigrants read foreign papers

Jay follows Kay as they walk by the glorious deco machines
offering pies pastries beverages

JAY
Is this your favorite place Makes
sense Zero human interaction
Kay ignores him

JAY (CONTD)
So how old are you

KAY
Twenty-six

JAY
Really Wow you got some city
miles on you
Jay laughs Kay ignores him stops in front of a machine
offering SPECIALS

Jay grabs a paper off a nearby table We see headlines about
Nixon Vietnam the Apollo Launch

Jay looks at the date July 14 1969

JAY (CONTD)
The fourteenth Then we have two
days
ay really takes his time picking out the right sandwich

JAY (CONTD)
Hey look I know your lunch is
important but like I said we only
have two days here

KAY
Here we go
ay puts some money in the machine -- is about to make his
selection Jay reacts to it -- GROSS
We see -- the most unappealing ham sandwich ever The meat

is tinged with green and beginning to get a little fuzzy No
one in their right mind would buy this sandwich

JAY
No way man I am not letting you
eat that I didnt come all the
way here to have you die before I
can tell you--
Kay reaches for the button Jay slaps his hand away
A BEAT of undignified hand-slap-fighting--

JAY (CONTD)
No way man No way the world ends
because you had to eat that thing--
Kay SUCCEEDS IN HITTING THE BUTTON and
FWOOOOOOPI
A SECRET DOOR instantly spins them around and Jay and Kay

INT MIB 1969 HQ

A cloud of smoke It clears and reveals
Mid-century futurism with a martini lunch office vibe Its

how Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury would have imagined the
MiB

offices

The cloud of smoke comes from everyone smoking Aliens run

around with ashtrays cocktail shakers and cigarettes The

alien smokers smoke from surprising orifices

The 1iB agents have the feel of ivy league privilege Very
male and very white Women are there to be secretaries and

eye candy

Two many-armed aliens stock the automat Kay tosses one the
sandwich it goes right back into the automat

Jay recognizes the aliens -- its the twins

JAY
Hey long alien name and Bob
Dont worry you guys get a big
promotion in like 20 years
Kay takes Jay down an escalator Quick atmospheric
establishing shots of MiB 69

times Castro Yoko Hendrix
- A cluster of agents use a joystick to manipulate a very
high-tech camera Reveal theyre using it to watch a
secretarys ass She gets wise turns -- they raise their
martinis and she giggles at them Youre incorrigible
- Aliens work switchboards work in the steno pool
- Someone barks at an alien to grab a couple Mooners and go
clean something up

REVEAL -- The 1969 Neuralizer fills an entire room And we

INT ROOM 43 -- NEURALIZER ROOM

Its manned by 60s labcoat technicians with sliderules and
punchcards

The Neuralizer itself is a piece of 60s-tech-glory --
magnets tubes things that look like they belong in Dr
Frankensteins lab

JAY
Whoa whoa what Youre gonna
neuralize ME You cant neuralize

Two ALIEN ORDERLIES grab Jay

KAY

The orderlies force Jay on a sort of gurney -- in the 69

Kay takes a SWING at Jay -- Jay dodges it easily

JAY (CONTD)
Thats right you always lead with

Kay pulls his weapon -- Jay ducks behind the Neuralizer --
now Kay cant shoot

KAY
Youre just making it worse for
yourself
The following plays over a game of CAT AND MOUSE around the
giant structure of the Neuralizer -- like through the stacks

in a library

KAY (CONTD)
Theres nowhere to run slim Its
just if were gonna do it easy or
do it hard
Jay runs into a dead end
Kay and the orderlies are on him The pissed-off orderlies
grab him roughly force him onto the gurney Jay keeps
flailing

JAY
I know you Kay I can prove it

Jay grabs Kays hand They LOCK EYES for a moment Kay lets
Jay flip his hand over big build-up REVEALING

JAY (CONTD)
Damn You will I swear
Kay signals -- the Neuralizer powers up
And Jay is on the conveyor belt into the machine This is
all about to be over Jay thinks desperately for a way out
THEN-- Eureka

JAY (CONTD)
Kay KAY What about your girl

Kay looks up Jay sees an opening

JAY (CONTD)
You chose the job over her -- but

How the hell do you know that
Ive never told anyone that
A long look at this guy who somehow knows things he
shouldnt
And he hits the POWER OFF BUTTON
But this being TUBE TECHNOLOGY -- we stay with JAYS
TERRIFYING POV -- as he slides through the claustrophobic
Neuralizer chamber -- the tubes powering down just in time
inches away from him
Jay crawls out of the Neuralizer shaken

JAY
You see Kay Its me--
But Kay grabs him and puts a gun on him--

KAY
If youre gonna drag her into this

jerking me around Ill make a

PRELL

KAY

You wanna play tough How about we

take a ride to the barber college

Kay keeps shaking them down but Jay is distracted

On Jay something is making him think

A sound it grows louder we start to be able to make

the distinct bip bip bip of PONG
Jay FOLLOWS THE SOUND

To a group of people -- that incredible Factory mix from
slumming socialites to Black Panthers to the freakiest
freaks

They surround a SKANKY GUY -- and whatever theyre watching
on TV is so mesmerizing its like theyre seeing the face of
God

BROOKE ASTOR
Its too beautiful
Someone takes a picture of the screen
Jay walks around the TV -- REVEAL
Theyre watching CLASSIC EARLY 70S PONG

The SKANKY GUY controls it via a BIG MEDALLION hooked up to
the TV antennae terminals Hes playing against a young
clean-cut square

Jay grabs the wires and rips them out cutting off the game
Everyone JEERS him

ON KAY hearing the noise turns to see whats going on

SKANKY GUY
What the hell man

JAY
Just wondering where you got that

SKANKY GUY
Your mother
The crowd laughs

JAY
Really So my mother gave you a
technology that hasnt been

INVENTED FOR SEVEN YEARS

Jay grabs him by the throat

Partygoers react Someone takes pictures Someone claps in
delight

JAY (CONTD)
Now how about you tell me where you
really got it
The skanky guy knows hes in trouble

SKANKY GUY
Oh uh okay no hassles
man I got it from that dude over
there With the beard

Jay turns lets go just long enough for the guy to LEAP OUT

THE WINDOW
Jay takes off after him -- Kay joins
And the CHASE IS ON

CHASE THROUGH THE VILLAGE
Jay and Kay chase the guy through various 60s locations - a
commune an ashram a folk club a protest

Everywhere they are mistaken for pigs - people get in
their

way

To Jays surprise young Kay is a hell of a runner in

incredible shape It gets competitive between them

Until Jay cant keep up -- Kay takes off

Kay runs the Skanky Guy down -

Jay huffs and puffs his way over grabs the medallion

JAY
Alright one more time Whered
you get this

SKANKY GUY
It was a gift--

JAY
Bullshit
Kay puts a gun on him

JAY (CONTD)
Oh hey This is my partner Hes
about to get fired for excessive
violence and he doesnt have much
left to lose

SKANKY GUY

CLICK Kay cocks the gun

SKANKY GUY (CONTD

JAY

thief Stole it from who

SKANKY GUY
They dont even care man They

JAY

SKANKY GUY
I dont know who they are--

KAY
Then youre not worth much to us

The gun comes back out

SKANKY GUY
I heard they were Archanans

JAY
Archanans Theyre pretty far out
of their neighborhood I didnt
think wed ever had one on Earth
before

SKANKY GUY
I can tell you where they live
Southwest corner of 3rd and Avenue
C Top floor Apartment 12
Jay rips the medallion off his neck

SKANKY GUY (CONTD)
Ow
JAY

out of here
The guy runs off

KAY
Whats the deal with the necklace

JAY
You were wearing one just like it
when you died Come on

SOUTHWEST CORNER OF 3RD AND AVENUE C
Jay and Kay pull up in front of the building

KAY
That address Its familiar
He pulls out a notebook

KAY (CONTD)
I was going to come by here
tomorrow to check out a lead on the
dry ice case

JAY
So you come here tomorrow get
tangled up with these Archanans
And

KAY
And Yaz kills me

JAY
Something like that So do me and
the people of Earth a favor and be
careful

KAY
Aw put on your big girl panties
and lets go
JAY
Hey Ive always got my big girl
panties on
Huh That didnt sound right

INT FREIGHT ELEVATOR
Jay and Kay ride up

KAY
That thing back at the party what
was it Some kind of game

JAY
Not just any game PONG Game of
kings But it wasnt invented
until 1974

KAY
How do you know that

JAY
Because I was the only kid on my
block who didnt have one

KAY
Aw whats the matter Daddy
didnt buy you the toy you wanted

JAY
Didnt have a daddy to not buy me
toys Heres the only thing I ever
got from him--
He holds up his key chain

KAY
Thats rough

JAY
It gets worse Youre the closest
thing I have to a dad
DOORS OPEN

DOWN THE RATTY HALLWAY
Jay and Kay move carefully ready for trouble

They get to the door -- Apartment 12

Jay points to the door -- THIS IS IT

They see -- THE DOOR IS SMASHED IN PUNCHED OFF ITS HINGES

And punched into the door -- THE IMPRESSION OF A SKULL RING
JAY

Thats from Yazs ring He was
here Or is here
Jay SIGNALS KAY

KAY
Why do you keep doing that

INT STUDIO APARTMENT

They move into the room on high alert

But its empty

They realize the strangeness of the room - alien technology
(including a TV hooked up to something strange with tons of
wires hanging out) and lots of money LOTS of money

Not just piles -- the actual furniture is MADE OF STACKS OF
MONEY Theyve been using it for scrap paper for napkins

JAY
So Yaz was never after you he
was after the Archanans You just
got in the way

KAY
Which must make them damn
important But what does he want
with them

JAY
No sign of struggle They mustve
cleared out before he got here
Like they knew he was coming
KAY
And hes probably on their trail
now But where the hell did they
go
They look around puzzling over this place Jay picks up a
100 bill off a table made out of stacks of money

JAY
Think this might tell us something
On the 100 bill
A strange series of words and numbers 3 2 51 7 5

KAY
Looks like some kind of code
Well take it to HQ run it through
the computer Figure out where
they went

BACK THROUGH THE HALLWAY
Jay and Kay walk down the dark hallway --
Yaz steps out of the shadows --

BACK IN THE CAR
Jay and Kay head back to HQ Kay drives Jay stares at the
100 bill squinting at it turning it over --

JAY
How about bible verses
Coordinates Airplane flights
Shoe sizes

KAY
So this is how you do it in the
future huh You just keep
guessing until you figure it out

JAY
(EUREKA)

Phone numbers
They stop at a light

Suddenly -- WHAM WHAM Someone FRANTICALLY POUNDS on the
trunk -- a frightened 12-year-old prostitute wearing what is
basically Jodi Fosters Taxi Driver hooker costume --
hotpants mary janes halter top Theres something familiar
about her face

HOT PANTS GIRL
For Gods sake Help me would
you Theres some maniac after me -

JAY
Slow down -- whos after you

HOT PANTS GIRL

He was like nothing I ever saw --
crazy eyes and this freaky skull
ring

Jay and Kay look at each other

JAY
Get in

HOT PANTS GIRL

dangerous city for a girl

The light turns green -- were on the girls face Jay and
Kay looking straight ahead

JAY
So where can we take you

HOT PANTS GIRL

Just make a left up here

Kay does it Theres a rushing noise

In the back seat Hot Pants Girl IS INFLATING AND BECOMING

DEVIL GIRL
The car turns down a dark deserted alley

JAY
Are you sure Seems dangerous

DEVIL GIRL
Not for me
Reveal -- the girl has fully inflated into her natural
form
-- DEVIL GIRL The outfit is grotesque on her

DEVIL GIRL ATTACKS

SET PIECE FIGHT in the car Employing cool MiB tech built

into the car

Devil Girl subdued locked into the trunk in a CONTAINMENT
SACK -- like what youd use to stuff a raccoon into

The fights over the guys slump against the car

JAY
What the hell was that

KAY
I dont know but Id bet you two
to one Yaz sent her
Beat Light bulb moment for Jay --

JAY
Say that again

KAY
I think Yaz sent her

JAY
No the whole thing

KAY
Id bet you two to one Yaz sent
her
On Jay realizing--
He grabs the 100 bill --

JAY
I know where they are

ON JAY AND KAY
Walking -- we hear sounds of crowds of cheering

ARE AT--

EXT AQUEDUCT RACETRACK

JAY
How are we going to find them Any
idea what an Archanan looks like
And then -- they see --

REVEAL we

AMID THE SEA OF GUYS IN SUITS HATS AND SKINNY TIES
of

A circle of what looks like Tibetan monks -- colorful
playful dressed in robes

They could only be -- the Archanans

The group comprises one older Archanan -- the LAMA -- and

three younger ATTENDANTS

KAY
I think I found them
They step into

THE ARCHANANS AURA
Within the space around the Archanans the chaos and noise

the crowd melts away Deflected
There are three Archanans and one distinctive older one --

THE LAMA

In the middle -- a giant pile of winnings

All is peaceful within this space Faint chimes

They greet Jay and Kay happily chant a strange mantra

ARCHANANS

(CHANTING)
King Lady Big Trouble Classy
The faint sound of an announcer

ANNOUNCER (V0)

Results for the sixth race King
Sweet Sophie Big Trouble and Red
Gent

ARCHANANS

(CHANTING)
Superba pays 3200 to one

JAY
Youre in danger--

ARCHANANS
Youre in danger youre in
danger
Jay thinks theyre playing the echo game like little kids

JAY
Very cute but--

LAMA
In eight seconds please do us the
kindness of ducking

JAY
Huh
KAY
Yaz
They turn to see YAZ -- he levels a WEAPON AT THEM -- FIRES
Jay and Kay DUCK -- the weapon just misses
JAY
Thanks
KAY

Lets get into trouble
Jay and Kay engage him --
As they run off the Lama calls --

LAMA
Remember please to take the
bridge
And we begin

BIG FIGHT SET PIECE

Try to include motorcycle and horse elements Could also
involve the actual aqueduct which is close by

At one point Jay and Kay seem stuck they remember

JAY
Take the bridge
They take the bridge which gives them an advantage on Yaz
At one point Jay corners Yaz -- Yaz BLASTS HIM -- Jay is
knocked down Looks DEAD But he shakes it off reveal
the PONG medallion blocked the shot
of

Culminating at a toxic waste dump in Staten Island with Yaz
compressed into a six inch cube - hauled away in the back

a garbage truck
The guys give chase -- they want him captured but no luck
The truck drives off

KAY
Hes gone

JAY
Only a matter of time before he
comes back And this time he might
be really mad

AQUEDUCT RACE TRACK

Jay and Kay return to an EMPTY RACE TRACK
Its like a ghost town

No Archanans to be found

JAY
Damn we lost them They come all
the way across the universe and
just when were about to figure out
what all of this is about--
Then faintly a CHEER

KAY
Hold that thought
They follow it out to

THE TRACK
Which is empty No spectators no horses Just the
Archanans
Who stand near the track watching nothing
And yet --
They cheer and clap as if watching the most exciting race
ever
Jay and Kay exchange a what the hell Look and approach
them

JAY
WATCHING

Everybody OK

ARCHANANS
Everybody is everybody

JAY
Yeah guess I cant argue with
that So listen up -- Yaz is down

but he wont be for long so we

need to start coming up with some
answers First of all--

The Archanans CHEER Jay shakes it off

JAY (CONTD)

FIRST
The Archanans CHEER AGAIN

JAY (CONTD)
What are you cheering about

ARCHANANS
The races
Jay and Kay keep approaching Puzzled -- the track is
empty

JAY

What races
Jay and Kay cross the threshold into their aura and now--
The empty stands are FILLED WITH CHEERING SPECTATORS

AN INCREDIBLY EXCITING RACE

JAY (CONTD)
Where are we

LAMA

We are tomorrow

Jay steps backwards out of the aura -- back to empty ghost
town

Steps back in -- tomorrows rabid fans cheering the race
From the Archanans POV -- we see ALL VERSIONSALL AGES OF

JAY AND KAY

The effect is -- THEY SEE ALL TIME AT ONCE
JAY

You can see the future
LAMA

It is what you call the future

ATTENDANT
Ah the future An illusion of the
time-bound borne of the fallacy
that one moment follows another

LAMA
Yaz suffers from this greatly And
so he must have revenge on your
planet

JAY
Revenge For what

LAMA
He mourns the past because he can
not see the dead are still as alive
as they ever were Just not now

JAY
Okay someday youre gonna explain
that to me but right now you need
to stop the riddles because theres
about two minutes until Yaz crawls
out of his hole and gets back to
trying to kill you So help me
out I need to know IN ENGLISH why
Yaz is trying to kill you and what
that has to do with saving the
Earth

ATTENDANT
We know what he will know

JAY
You know what he will know
(figuring it out)
You know his plans

(REALIZING)
And youre going to stop him He
wants to kill you because you stop
him

LAMA

(CHEERFUL)
Yes if he does not kill us first

KAY
Dont you know if hes going to

LAMA
Sometimes he kills us sometimes he
does not There are many futures

JAY
Okay which future is the one where
you live and the Earth doesnt blow
up

LAMA
The one where you take us home
Jay and Kay exchange a look --

KAY
Alright lets get these freaks
home and pronto

LAMA
You must let go of your attachment
to time beginning with your
concept of pronto
And on that -- THUP THUP THUP --
12 Blacked-out helicopters

EX (V0)

(MEGAPHONE)
Illegal aliens -- you are
surrounded Do not attempt to
flee

Jay and Kay YELL INTO THE BACKWASH OF THE ROTORS

JAY
No We need to get them home
But its all drowned out in the wind and dust
MiB squad cars -- pull up and surround them
Jay and Kay look for an escape route -- but MiB cars and
trucks seem to be pouring in from everywhere
MiB agents descend on ropes round up the Archanans--

EX (V0)

(MEGAPHONE)
Agent Kay Return to your vehicle
Rendezvous at headquarters in 20
minutes We will escort you by
air
And from the noise and chaos of the choppers
To silence

INT MIB HQ - BENCH OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM

Jay and Kay watch through a glass wall

Inside the conference room -- the Archanans sit around a
table

Ex paces clearly talking ABOUT the Archanans to the other
agents

Body language tells us the MiB reach some kind of consensus
Ex comes out -- Jay and Kay hop up

Ex notices Jay for the first time --

EX
Whats he doing here Didnt we
just bust you
KAY
That was someone else All these
mooners look alike right
A beat -- and Ex buys it completely

EX
Yeah So look Weve talked
about it And you are to be
commended Agent Kay You did a
fine job bringing these illegals
in Now its our job to get them
out of the city for containment
Somewhere where if someone decides
to blow them off the map the
collateral damage will be
insignificant Toronto

KAY
But theyre in danger One of the
most dangerous beings in the
universe is out to kill them--
(looks to Jay)
And if that happens were all
going with them because theyre
our only hope of survival

EX
Christ if we listened to every
Mooner who showed up telling us how
they were gonna save the world
thats all wed do Do you know
why Earth is still standing

(MORE )

EX (CONTD)
Why were not a smoldering chunk of
nothing Because we dont stick
our nose into other peoples
business Especially people in
danger because they have enemies
and those enemies destroy Earth
Now Are you going to execute my
order or not

KAY

(COLD)
I thought we were supposed to be
the good guys

EX
Careful Agent Kay That sounds
like insubordination
Kay walks up to Ex looks him DEAD IN THE EYE

KAY
It sounds like you need to cut some
eyeholes in your stomach because
your head is so far up your ass
thats the only way you could
possibly see

EX
Thats it Youre off this case
Stick to dry ice If I catch you
near them -- or him -- again Ill
have your badge
(to a bunch of other

AGENTS)
You four -- take the Archanans to
transpo
One of the agents looks up--

YOUNG AGENT
Me Im just an accountant---

EX
Go

(TO JAY)
And you You just get out of
here

The MiB agents GRAB the Archanans and hustle them out
Kay leans in to them--

KAY
Dont worry well--

LAMA

Yes we know

Kay looks up -- sees Jay smiling at him
KAY

What
JAY

I knew Agent Kay wasnt just gonna
lie down So whats the plan

KAY
You heard the man Weve got dry
ice to investigate

GARBAGE COMPACTOR TRUCK
Its the truck that compacted Yaz We follow it to the

MIDDLE OF

GIANT STATEN ISLAND DUMP

Where the truck dumps its load Including YAZ

Who gets PROCESSED AND PRESSED INTO A CUBE

On the cube -- it begins to swell and force itself back into
its natural shape

Around the piles of garbage other Yaz parts SEEK EACH OTHER

OUT

DUMP EXIT
Workers stop what theyre doing -- get out of the way of
something disturbed
We see Yaz and understand the reaction -- Yaz might be back
together but NOT AT ALL RIGHT -- a leg stuck in the wrong

place the head at a weird angle

He catches his reflection in a hubcap and adjusts himself
Pops out an eye swaps an arm

He unfurls his tongue smells the air --

YAZ
Where did you go
four

SHOWWORLD CENTER
A SLEAZY GUY is suprised to see not just an agent but

agents and four Hare-Krishna-looking guys come out of his
peep show window
One of the Archanan attendants smiles at him

ATTENDANT

(CHEERFUL)
You will die alone

SLEAZY GUY
Yeah I know
The agents lead the Archanans through the worlds greatest
emporium of sleaze

EXT GRAND CENTRAL STATION
The hustle and bustle -- cabs picking up and dropping off

PASSENGERS --
We find a LONG LINE OF UNHAPPY KIDS MAKING UNHAPPY PARENTS

Kids crying pulling on Moms dress
We see -- its the line to an ICE CREAM TRUCK
And the line isnt moving because KAY IS QUESTIONING THE

PAPER-HATTED VENDOR
DRY ICE SMOKE rises from the freezer

KAY
Just a few more questions about dry
ice and Ill be out of your hair
A BIRD CALL makes Kay turn --he sees Jay waving him over
pointing at something -- The MiB agents lead the Archanans
into the Station

VENDOR
I told you ten times -- I got no
idea what dry ice is

KAY
(not listening)
Thanks youve been very helpful
Jay and Kay peel off follow the MiB agents leaving the
Vendor scratching his head He turns back to the kids
Jay and Kay follow the MiBers and Archanans inside

INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION

The Men in Black blend in easily with the guys going home to
Greenwich but the Archanans are easy to spot

Jay and Kay tail them -- and lose them for an instant

They spot a glimpse of robe run after them turn a corner -

And its just some Hare Krishnas

KAY
Damn Wrong freaks
But Jay spots the Archanans

JAY
Over there Kay
As they run off --

HARE KRISHNA
Perhaps youd like to join us for a
vegetarian meal
Jay and Kay chase after the MiB agents and Archanans --
The MiB agents approach a cordoned-off area with signs
warning WET PAINT
The agents look around then slip pass the ropes and through
a NARROW DOOR marked WET PAINT or MEN WORKING
Jay and Kay follow
Through the skinny half-painted door

THROUGH THESKINNY DOOR
An EQUALLY SKINNY ESCALATOR descends 100s of feet A

problem its going the WRONG WAY -- bringing incognito
aliens and MiB agents UP INTO GRAND CENTRAL
Jay and Kay muscle their way down -- lots of scuse me --

pardon me -- hey dont grab that
But once they power past the crowds Jays jaw drops as we
reveal
board

SECRET TRAIN STATION

A MUCH-BIGGER station under Grand Central a secret hub for
sending aliens back and forth all over the country

Its basically a series of GIANT PNEUMATIC TUBES --people-
sized versions of the vacuum tubes that used to beeverywhere
in banks offices etc

A mix of ALIENS and MIB AGENTS put on helmets and pads

the tubes and FWOOP off

Quick shots -- a shoeshine stand set up for many-limbed
aliens a newsstand with strange papers The Beatles in
line for Liverpool with a blue meanie Kareem Abdul-
Jabbar

KAY
On your 2 oclock
They spot the MiBers and the Archanans next to the TUBE TO

CANADA

TUBE TO CANADA

The MiB agents put helmets and pads on the Archanans
Theyre about to load them into the tubes --

Jay and Kay approach

Kay gestures them closer -- he reaches for something in his

jacket pocket
The MiBers lean in
And Kay GRABS THEM AND SHOVES THEM BACKWARDS TOWARDS THE

TUBE
The MiB agents stumble surprised --
The Archanans not surprised step deftly out of the way

MiBers FWOOP FWOOP FWOOP into the tube
Jay and Kay exchange a smile and realize One last VERY
YOUNG agent is still standing there wide-eyed

YOUNG AGENT
Dont hurt me Im just the
accountant
He reaches for his radio Jay talks him down

JAY
I know youre a little freaked out
and you want to call for backup
but listen When youve done this
job for a while you realize
theres one rule -- things arent
what they seem These are innocent
beings that need our protection
Are you gonna do the right thing or
are you gonna be a company man and
send them off to die in Toronto
The young agent thinks -- puts down the radio

JAY (CONTD)
Good good Whats your name

YOUNG AGENT

The Archanans smile
ATTENDANT
Here is the way home
The Lama removes a postcard-sized card from his robe and
hands it to one of his attendants
The attendant bows and RITUALLY PASSES IT it passes
through all the attendants and then to JAY
Jay gives it a look

JAY

LAMA
The only future that ends with life

JAY

Kay turns to head off -- then lightening fast spins and

reaches into Jays pocket snatches out the card --

KAY (CONTD)

JAY

KAY

He gets his answer -- Jay DECKS HIM
JAY

You stay home and stay alive
But Kay isnt down

KAY
I told them Id help them -- Im
honor-bound to do it
Kay throws a DIRTY SUCKER-PUNCH to Jays kidney
Jay recovers and throws an UPPERCUT to Kays solar plexus
Jay winces -- like he just hit something hard

JAY
Damn you used to have some abs
They continue to pound each other As they trade punches

JAY (CONTD)
I cant let you go to Florida

KAY
I make my own future Besides --
Im younger and stronger than you

They both attempt an identical spin kick at the same time --
feet collide

JAY
Bet youre sorry you taught me
that
The fight continues Theyre wearing down circling each
other

And then Kay fakes a left ---

JAY (CONTD)
You always lead with your--
But this time Kay connects with his right knocking Jay down
hard
robe

KAY
Had enough yet
On Jay -- gasping spent -- using every last reserve of
strength to lift himself off that floor

JAY
I cant let you go -- I love you
Jay KICKS KAY SAVAGELY IN THE GROIN Kay LUNGES AT JAY
They CLINCH its a stalemate

KAY
Aw hell look at that-- behind you-

JAY
Im not falling for that

KAY
Im not kidding --
Kay rotates their clinch towards the tube so Jay can see
The ARCHANANS -- very cheerfully benignly hopping into the

FLORIDA TUBE
Jay and Kay share a look -- and both run INTO THE TUBE

THROUGH THE TUBES
Jay Kay and the Archanans hurtle through the MiB system of
pneumatic tubes

The Archanans fly through the tubes relaxed and happy
moving gracefully like fish through water

Kay is in perfect controlled tube position -- everything
clenched hands by his sides looking like hes in an air
luge

Jay is SCREAMING and ricocheting off the sides of the tube
like a pinball

They shoot SOUTH passing landmarks of the Eastern
seaboard

ntercut with Jays face -- blown back like Right Stuff
astronauts in a G-Force simulator

Jay FLAILS towards the Archanans grabs onto the Lamas

JAY
(yelling over the wind

NOISE)
I have to know -- can I really
prevent Kays murder

LAMA
Yes

JAY
Oh Okay then Thanks good to
hear

LAMA

But where there was death there
will be death

JAY
What does that mean
The Lama smiles and zips ahead through the current Jay gets
CLOBBERED by a bend in the tube

EXT FIELD

Sugar cane workers pick crops next to a GIANT IRRIGATION
PIPE

They look up as SCREAMS DOPPLER THROUGH THE PIPE -- what the

hell was that
We follow the SCREAM

BACK IN THE TUBE
Jay CONTINUES TO SCREAM --

POOP
EXT FLORIDA SWAMPMANATEE PRESERVE - END OF THE TUBE

Jay Kay and the Archanans are launched from the tube like
human cannonballs

The Archanans land gracefully floating down air currents
like kung fu masters

Kay hits with both feet and rolls

Jay face plants into the water

Jay looks up -- FIVE MANATEES STARE HIM DOWN The ALPHA
MANATEE emits along lowing manatee song which RESOLVES INTO

COUGHING --

ALPHA MANATEE
Sorry I have something in my
throat They went that way

JAY
Thanks
Surrounded by thick brush trees Jay staggers out of the
water looking beat to hell

JAY (CONTD)
Kay Archanans Everyone OK

Reveal -- Everyone else looks clean and pressed Jay looks
around -- nothing but brush and swamp

JAY (CONTD)
Listen your uh
Arachanessness I dont think

planet
The Archanans smile and WALK OFF Jay and Kay follow --

JAY (CONTD)
Hey wait -- we cant help you get

He trails off as they EMERGE FROM THE BRUSH
And stop dead

JAY (CONTD)

GUARD (CONTD)
Lt Colonel Here are the
intruders sir
Jay cranes to see the Colonel -- hes African American Jay
grins relieved --

JAY
Finally someone I can talk to--
But the Colonel is on him before you can blink an equal-
opportunity hardass to the extreme

COLONEL
The only thing were gonna talk
about is what specific breed of
dumbass you have to be to try to
penetrate my launch site
He begins patting Jay down Eyes widen --

COLONEL
Weapon You are going away for a
long time

Get them into holding Well
interrogate them after the launch

A beat and Jay goes for it
JAY

government agency in charge of
protecting the world from the scum
of the universe and right now on
behalf of the people of Earth I
need to commandeer your rocket so

THEY--
(points to Archanans)
--can board it Can we count on
your help
The Colonel stares at him for a beat

COLONEL
So you want us to stop the most
massive endeavor in American
history an event being watched by
the entire world the moment that
will be the culmination of a
challenge put to us by President
John F Kennedy himself soa
bunch of Hare Krishnas can take a
joy ride

JAY
Would it help if I told you Im
from the future

COLONEL
Get them out of here
He motions to the other MPs who move to roust the group
But the Lama takes the Colonel by the arm--

COLONEL (CONTD)
Hey
--and PULLS HIM INTO HIS AURA
On THE COLONELS face He sees something POWERFUL
The Lama releases him
The officer is stunned for a moment Blinks back into focus
and turns to the other guards --

COLONEL (CONTD)
You men are no longer needed here
Report to delta gate

GUARD
Sir

COLONEL
Go

GUARD

Yes sir
The Colonel turns to Jay Kay and the Archanans

COLONEL
The rest of you come with me
The Colonel heads into the building They follow

JAY
Things change when you can see the
future right

fq

COLONEL
They sure do This is definitely
about some next-level shit
The PA crackles

fq

PA (V0)
T-minus seven minutes to launch

MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY

Mission control is an underground hub with hallway spokes
Jay Kay and the Archanans follow the Colonel down the
hallway towards the main Mission Control center

MISSION CONTROL
A hive of activity leading up to the launch Miles and
miles of white guys in buzzcuts and shortsleeve button-down
shirts Thick glasses slide rules pocket protectors -- a
sea of IBM men
Everyone smoking RUSHING AROUND LAST-MINUTE CHAOS
Hunkered over computer monitors reel-to-reel data tapes
spinning Less computing power than an iPhone but we put a
man on the moon

PA (V0)
T-minus six minutes

JAY
Attention everyone Weve got a
change in plans
Everyones consumed with the launch and wearing headsets --
they ignore him -- he keeps trying --
JAY (CONTD)
Hey Attention over here I need
to talk to the man who can re-
program this rocket
Still nothing --

JAY (CONTD)
Can anyone hear me Hey You in
the glasses

25 people in identical giant black plastic glasses turn

COLONEL (0S)
Agent Jay Over here
They see the Colonel with an Engineer at a workstation

COLONEL (CONTD)
This is your man
The guys approach the Engineer --

ENGINEER
You see this card The rockets
flight path is all on cards just
like this one Right here --
He indicates a long metal rack like a mail-sorting machine
that holds many 1000s of cards and feeds them into a
processor
An Archanan approaches and BLOWS ON THE CARDS -- it hits the
cards like a mini-whirlwind The cards spiral everywhere
like bats pouring out of a cave -- chads fly off -- theyre
magically re-programmed And fly back into the rack
The engineers are STUNNED And then PANIC

ENGINEER (CONTD)
The trajectory has been altered
A BIG LOW-TECH GRAPHIC APPEARS on the BIG LOW-RES MONITOR
TRAJECTORY CHANGE

ENGINEER (CONTD)
Abort launch Abort launch

JAY
Slow down there Everyone be cool

ENGINEER
Coolness is an inappropriate
response
The Engineer flips the SAFETY off a red button marked
ABORT

ENGINEER (CONTD)
Aborting in 5

JAY
No Stop Do not abort

ENGINEER

The Engineer raises his ABORTING HAND -- About to slam it

down in the button

- KAY
This might help
Kay reaches into his jacket takes out WHAT APPEARS TO BE A

NEURALIZER

JAY
Whats that You been holding out
on me

KAY

Little something Ive been working
on Glasses if youve got ‘em
Jay and Kay put on their glasses

ENGINEER

Jay and Kay in sunglasses -- for a moment its the iconic
look of the posters

JAY
Ha ha just like old times

KAY
Oh and you might want to get under
a desk
JAY
Get under a--
ENGINEER
One
The engineers hand comes down but before he can hit the
BUTTON --

Kay hits the trigger --

But instead of a FLASH --

A MILLION PELLETS EXPLODE OUT OF THE NEURALIZER -- bouncing
everywhere knocking out the engineers

The pellets KEEP WHIZZING EVERYWHERE THROUGH THE FOLLOWING
Jay and Kay have to talk over the sounds of people getting
KOd

JAY
What the hell was that

KAY
Its a high-velocity non-lethal
pellet-gun The boys in the lab
call it the hiv-nol-pog

JAY
Catchy
The Archanans deftly step out of the way -- or the pellets
swerve around them
EX RUNS IN flanked by security andor MiB agents

EX
Its Kay There he is Take him
down Shoot him if you have to
EX catches a PELLET TO THE GROIN crumples
The pellets settle quiet
HELL

PA (V0)
T-minus Five minutes
The engineers start COMING TO dazed wondering WHAT THE

JUST HAPPENED -- Kay and Jay give them a neuralizer cover
STORY
JAY

(TO CROWD)
What the hell is wrong with you

a personal tour of Mission Control

schoolgirls

KAY
What a waste

ENGINEER
Raquel Welch was here

JAY
Five minutes to get to the rocket
And keep your eyes open for Yaz
They head out

Cut TO

ON THE TARMAC

With only a few minutes to go service trucks CLEAR THE
TARMAC -- dozens of fuel trucks etc Driving to get a safe
distance away from the blast

The all SWERVE OUT OF THE WAY

As one car cuts through them GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY parting
the waters -- its a military jeep -- THE COLONEL at the
wheel Jay Kay and the rest barely hanging on

Cut TO

ASTRONAUT TRANSPORT -- DRIVING
The apollo astronauts ride across the tarmac towards the
rocket The only car Looking up at that rocket

KAY

JAY
But weve got some bigger fish to
fry Hand over the flight suits
They start pulling the astronauts off the truck
The astronauts protest

JAY (CONTD)
Lets go people Why dont you
take one giant leap out of there

They look at Jay and Kay at the Colonel

COLONEL

Thats right gentlemen You need

The astronauts acquiesce

BUZZ ALDRIN

trap anyways

NEIL ARMSTRONG

CUT TO
EXT MISSION CONTROL STRUCTURE ENTRANCE

The same guards who stopped Jay and Kay are back on duty
They hear something -- they draw weapons --

And its Yaz Still looking like evil incarnate The guards
take in this unholy picture

GUARD
WHAT THE--

YAZ
I want in
The guards look at each other --

GUARD
Should we radio the Colonel

GUARD (CONTD)
You wanna get yelled at again
They wave him by

GUARD (CONTD)
Go ahead

LAUNCH PLATFORM
Kay loads the Archanans into the capsule Technicians in
clean suits assist

Jay works like a secret service agent -- scanning for all
possible threats

Jay checks his stop watch -- Four minutes to go

Kay workswith the Archanans--

JAY
We good yet Kay I dont like
being out here in the open -- too
many ways for Yaz to get to you

KAY
Im almost there
Kays got them inside but having problems with the hatch

KAY (CONTD)
Hey tech guys -- get back here and
help me with the door

TECH

KAY
Whatever just get over here

JAY
Oh come on -- whats going on

KAY
This door is complicated

JAY
Oh for

KAY

What Its an Apollo rocket not a
Plymouth Valiant OK Its

complicated

Jay goes over to help Kay with the door
They both fuss and fight over the door

JAY
Lift it You have to lift it

KAY
No I am lifting it You have to
hold the lever

JAY
No if I hold the lever the rubber

than

against

thingie wont go in the thing
where the thingie goes
Kay notices something in the reflection of the hatch glass

KAY
Jay Why do you think a highly
trained NASA technician would leave
the back of his suit unzipped
They exchange a look that parallels the opening scene in the
Chinese restaurant

JAY
Because its about to go down
They turn around draw weapons on the tech -- its YAZ

NOTE TO READER
Welcome to the good stuff
From here we launch into a GIANT SET PIECE that will take

up and around the Apollo Rocket
As Jay and Kay battle Yaz and Devil Girl in a super-high-
stakes confrontation to protect the Archanans

We will pay off that YAZ ISAVIRUS bentonDESTROYINGTHE
EARTH to avenge the deaths ofhis brothers --smallpoxand
bubonic plague

The launch clock ticks down -- the action moves around pipes
breathing fire the gigantic scaffolding liquid oxygen
spewing from the rocket All on top of a rocket taller

a 30-story skyscraper
With T-minus 25 seconds to go Jay and Kay corner Yaz

the lunar capsule

BACK TO SCENE
Yaz laughs at Jay and Kay

YAZ
You cant stop me Nothing on
Earth can stop me

JAY
Nothing now
Yaz raises an eyebrow

Jay draws his NOISY CRICKET -- the gun he brought from the
future

KAY
Whats that

JAY
Little something I brought with me
Jay points the gun at Yaz -- but Yaz just LAUGHS --
As the clock ticks down to T-minus 5 4

YAZ

Try it You wouldnt dare One
false shot and youll rip space and
time

JAY
Thats a chance Ill have to take
Jay BLASTS YAZ
Yaz stumbles BACK INTO THE CAPSULE The hatch SLAMS him

Just as the ROCKET BEGINS LIFTOFF--

HUGE FLAMES - HUGE CLOUDS OF SMOKE THREATEN TO ENGULF JAY

KAY -
KAY
Uh oh --
But the Archanans surround them with their aura -- where the

flames and smoke flow harmlessly around them
And then its over

BIG VICTORY MOMENT
As they watch the rocket carry Yaz off

JAY
We did it partner I hope you
remember this when you recruit me --
you wont give me such a hard time

KAY
You know I will

JAY
Yeah

KAY
I guess well have to builda
prison on the moon or something
Jay realizes -- grabs Kay --

JAY

Do a better job this time OK
That needs to be one hell of a
prison You dont want that guy
coming back or Im coming back
Look once was enough OK

Jay turns to The Colonel --

JAY (CONTD)
Thank you for your help sir Hope
we dont get you fired

COLONEL
Not too worried about that

JAY
Can I ask you -- what did the Lama
show you in there that made you
help us Was it the Earth being
destroyed

COLONEL
No -- it was my son All grown up
As a matter of fact Im late to
see him -- I promised Id watch the
launch with him

JAY
Oh Thanks Hes a lucky kid

COLONEL
Im a lucky dad Take care
Jay offers him a handshake The officer takes it -- and

pulls Jay into a hug

JAY
Okay
The Colonel leaves Jay and Kay congratulate each other
smile over a job well done
But then they see the Archanans

KAY
Were sorry we didnt get you home
guys It was the only way to get
rid of Yaz

JAY
But well make sure youre safe
here And the next rocket out

LAMA
All is well You have done well

JAY
No we didnt You wanted to go
home

LAMA
There is what we desire and what
must be And now our gift to
you

JAY

Gift But we didnt get you home

ARCHANANS
There is the action and there is
the intention It is the intention
we reward

LAMA
You did the right thing And if
humans are capable of such
sacrifice such friendship
perhaps we ARE already home

JAY
So then whats the gift

LAMA
You already have it

And realize
Jay looks at pong

JAY
This Pong

LAMA
Yes PONG The Pan-Galactic
Ordnance Negation Grid Agent Kay
will use this technology

JAY
To make the missile defense system
You use this to save the world

ARCHANANS
Yes Dont drop it
They take the PONG and drape it around Kays neck
The Archanans leave chanting

ARCHANANS (CONTD)

(CHANTING)
Bip Bip Bip
And its just Jay and Kay
Jay looks at Kay wearing the PONG just like in the case
file picture

JAY
Hey My watch stopped
We see -- a minute to go Jay looks at the watch Something

about it bothers him

KAY
Cmon Lets go watch that bastard
leave the atmosphere

JAY
Yeah Ill catch up with you ina

second

KAY GETS INTO THE ELEVATOR
Jay hangs back approaches the Archanans walks them down
the
scaffolding

JAY
So you guys understand all this
time stuff right So is
everything going to be okay now I
mean if I saved everything and
Yaz is really gone why am I even
here Shouldnt I not have come in
the first place And why do I
still have time left on my watch

UNDERGROUND
The scaffolding leads Jay and the Archanans into the maze of
underground hallways
Jay walks looking at his watch thinking

He sees a WALL CLOCK -- 359

JAY
359 But Kay didnt get killed
until
And then the AWFUL REALIZATION --

JAY (CONTD)
He didnt come yet Kay he didnt
come yet
Jay races to find Kay

WITH KAY
Unaware that his appointment with death is near

WITH YAZ AND DEVIL GIRL
Racing down a hallway hunting Kay

WITH JAY
Running running searching where is Kay

INTERCUT BETWEEN KAY YAZ JAY
All converging on destiny
AND

shape

WITH JAY
Running more frantic now
And then he sees him
Kay -- at the end of the hallway Backlit by the door to
the outside

JAY
Kay
And then Jay sees -- Yazl Already there
Jay goes for his weapon but he doesnt have the shot
Yaz pulls his guns

ay turns to see Yaz -- theres no time to react only to
now HES ABOUT TO DIE
Yaz FIRES
But -- THE COLONEL is somehow there instead He catches the
bullet for Kay -- his body dematerializes

And it gives Jay the split-second he needs to FIRE ON YAZ

ILL HIM blowing him OUTSIDE -- where he is INCINERATED BY
LIQUID OXYGEN leftover from the launch
They look at each other -- its over

KAY
See I knew you had my back
Jay hears footsteps Looks up and sees the SHADOW OF A TALL

MAN -- REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO JAYS OWN SILHOUETTE
As the footsteps approach the shadow grows smaller
shrinking to KID SIZE Its a boy

KIDS VOICE
Dad Whats going on
The kid steps into the light -- backlit -- but from the

of his head and Jays reaction this kid could only be YOUNG
JAY

JAY
Where there is death there will

always be death He saved your
life He swapped his for yours
chain

ay

ay

ay

OK

He saved the world

puts a firm hand on Jay --

KAY

Tll take it from here

steps away but turns back

In a replay of the moment from the first movie Jay tosses

a modern Neuralizer

JAY

Leave me some memories this time

KAY

Sure partner Ill see you
around

Yes
Kay
Jay
Kay
was

Hey

JAY
you will
turns back to the boy takes his hand
watches them from a distance
takes something off the ground where The Colonels body
-- hands it to the son

KAY
look -- your Dad wanted you to

have this

Kay gives the kid a shiny new commemorative Apollo key
Jay looks in his pocket -- the same key chain scratched and
worn
YOUNG JAY
Where is he
KAY
Your daddy had to go -- hes part

of the space program now Hes
okay he just had to take a trip up
to the stars but youll be just
fine Ill keep an eye on you
They are silhouetted by the bright light of the Apollo
launch
Jay takes out his iPhone and ALL GOES WHITE

PURE WHITE LIGHT
And it resolves into

NEW YORK - BACK TO PRESENT DAY
Jay comes to in the Apple Store looks to the sky and

THE MISSILES ARE STILL COMING
JAY
Noo
And then
A giant PONG PADDLE rises over the horizon and

PONGS THE MISSILES BACK INTO SPACE

EXT MIB HQ ENTRANCEVENTILATION BUILDING

Jay is walking on air -- thrilled to see the deadpan
security

guard

JAY

Its good to see you man

He gives him a hug-- gets a what the hell face

INT MIB HQ

Jay is thrilled to be back -- hugging everyone he can

No one else knows what hes talking about -- from their POV

shots

of Ex the bitter janitor aged Devil Girl pushing the coffee

cart

Jay bounces through the MiB HQ -- its just a regular day to

everyone else but its HOME SWEET HOME to Jay

He even gives the worm guys a big gushy hug

A crowd of people gathers around Kay congratulating him on
winning the Bowling trophy AGAIN
Kay looks up -- SMILES BIG when he sees Jay

KAY
Alright everyone give me and my
partner here a minute
They leave the guys alone A beat -- and Jay just wraps him
in THE BIGGEST HUG EVER

JAY

(MORE )

JAY (CONTD)
When you disappeared Why didnt
I forget you when everyone else
did

KAY
Well I dont know exactly
Because I was dead But ina
quantum reality objects can exist
in contradictory states So
multiple timelines with varying
probabilities can exist and the
one youre closest to

MATHEMATICALLY --
JAY
Oh youre talking about our
closeness youre talking about
our love Across timelines
Youre saying our love will go on
Kay swats him away -- but the love couldnt be more clear
Jay feels something in his pocket -- the keychain Takes it
out

JAY (CONTD)
He was a good man

KAY
Yes he was

JAY

KAY
So you travelled back in time huh
