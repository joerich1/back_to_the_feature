She takes it holds it up to her lips
He lights it for her

She smokes in slow steady pulls

office

She stubs out her cigarette and sits down on the bed She
gives him a languishing inviting look

GLORIA
You dont really want to go
out into that heat do you

He stares at her absorbing the lines of her figure the
slim legs sheathed in silk stockings

JOHN

She slides her skirt up her thighs revealing the creamy
flesh between her stocking tops

GLORIA

him but she isnt sure how to use it or even how much
she wants it Shes not immune to what hes doing to her
though She likes it

Shes standing with her back to us now She reaches back
and unclasps her bra and the only thing thats keeping

arms around her back and pulls her down onto the bed

Sweat rolls into his eyes He wipes his forehead with a
sleeve Then gently he lifts a corner of the pan up and
down so that the solution flows back and forth over the

into the envelope and pulls out an 8 x 10 black-and-white

on her face

Beaumont fans himself with his hat

BEAUMONT (CONTD)
You seem to be taking this a
lot better than I thought you
would

She glances at him coolly then takes a few more photos
out of the envelope and looks at them They are
progressively more compromising

One of them shows Tom and Aurora on the bed without
their clothes

Glorias untroubled look turns abruptly hard

BEAUMONT (CONTD)
Thats one of my favorites
Didnt have a hell of a lot of
light to work with but
theres no doubt about what
those two are doing

She puts the photos down on the table and pushes them
into a stack with her finger

BEAUMONT (CONTD)
Theres a copy of your
husbands bill for the room in
there too

She slides a thick pay envelope across the table

He picks it up and turns it over in his plump hands He
opens it Theres a packet of stiff new bills inside

BEAUMONT (CONTD)
Genuine coin a the realm

He takes the bills out counts them taps their edges
into alignment He stuffs them back into the envelope and
tucks the flap in over them

BEAUMONT
(smiling bleakly)
Well Im not a marriage
counselor but offhand Id say
its already over between you

As he slides out of the booth he hacks out a chuckle

BEAUMONT (CONTD)
Look at it this way -- half of
all marriages end in divorce
Which is not as bad as it
sounds when you consider the
other half end in death

to
