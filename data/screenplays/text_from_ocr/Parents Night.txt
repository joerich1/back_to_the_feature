RIGHT” BLASTS ON

We start SHOWING AWESOME PHOTOS of our two heroes ADAM
AND CHRISTINA PONDER partying like teenage rock stars in
high schoolthen meeting and partying together in
collegethen tearing up Chicago in their early 20s

The shots start pretty tame with wine coolers and
cigarettesand get progressively harder with drunken
skinny dipping astronaut helmets filled with pot smoke
and passed out faces with penises on them

As the MUSIC GETS LOUDER AND AWESOME-ER THE CUTS BETWEEN
PHOTOS START COMING FASTER AND FASTER ALL BUILDING TO A
PRETTY AWESOME GODDAMN CRESCENDO CULMINATING IN A

PHOTO OF ADAM AND CHRISTINA HOLDING HANDS SMILING
WIDEWITH KEG TAPS IN BOTH THEIR MOUTHS

Suddenly THE WHOLE SCREEN STARTS TO TURN CLOCKWISE until
we realize that they are actually upside down and being
held up for kegstands as we

Parker’s a joke Harrison

HARRISON
True But he’s a very hot movie director
who chose us to help him with music on

relationships as anything I didn’t use
to have to explain that to you

ADAM
What the hell does that mean

HARRISON
Everything okay at home Don’t answer
Ask me the same question

ADAM
No

HARRISON
Because you know if you ask me I will
tell you that I don’t have a family I
don’t have a family because I go out
every night and listen to music and sleep
with Asian girls I don’t like cocaine

half-eaten cheeses pics of a shirtless Ryan Gosling on a
laptop until we find ourselves in the middle of

A classic drunken dance-off Each lady has a turn

Victoria jumps up and does sexy moves from her pole
dancing class

As she does Amy chugs from a bottle of red wine Wine
spills down her face until she decides it’s her turn and
pushes Victoria out of the way

Amy starts doing some violent crunking Emphasis on
violent She is getting way too into ituntil out of
nowhereVictoria clobbers her with a pillow

When Amy pops up laughing Christina and Aisha take the
floor at the same time playing off each other

Amy and Victoria love it They light cigarettes and hop
on the bed and cheer on Victoria and Aisha who do the Kid
and Play dance from “House Party”

Suddenly the fire alarm goes off (from the cigarettes)
and Victoria calmly just walks into Adam’s closet grabs
a golf club and proceeds to BASH THE ALARM TO SHIT

Just as calmly she tosses the club aside and keeps
dancing her ass off to the delight of the others

ADAM
My prick boss promised he’d give me the
company when he retired and now he’s
having second thoughts

JOHN
But you’re wonderful

ADAM

I don’t know which way is up right now
I kept telling Christina that we could
afford the new place that I could make
enough to cover everything that she
could stay home with Leo like she wanted
but if all this doesn’t work out I don’t
know it’s possible we could lose the
house On top of that her and I have
been off lately and I don’t know how to
fix it What I do know is that I feel
like a shell of the man she married

(beat)
Honestly do you guys think our wives
love us as much now as they did back in
the day

CHRISTINA
I love Leo so much and think we’ve done a
decent job with him all considered and
I just thought we were done I was
looking forward to getting back my life

point

ADAM

CHRISTINA
Since my gynecologist told me I’ve felt
totallytrapped That’s why I jumped
at your party idea To prove I wasn’t as
old as I am That I still had it You
know just like you

ADAM
You know I don’t think that’s why I
wanted the party I think I just wanted
to party I think I may just be a guy
who wants to party every once in awhile
The good news is it’s out of my system

CHRISTINA
For good

ADAM
For now I can always do it again if I
want It just doesn’t have to be such a
big deal

INT ADAM AND CHRISTINA’S HOUSE - MORNING
Christina surveys her ruined home and passed out friends

CHRISTINA
This is unacceptable

She walks - INTO THE BATHROOM - and grabs HAIR SPRAY from
the vanity She walks back into - THE LIVING ROOM - and
heads for the fireplace Grabs the igniter

She then goes over and stands on the couch lights the
igniter and holds it up to the hair spray

ADAM
What are you--

She sprays the hair spray and creates a mini-flamethrower
like Amy did before

ADAM (CONT’D)
No

Christina raises the flamethrower up to--
THE FIRE ALARM
The ALARM SOUNDS It’s really loud Parents stir

RANDOM PARENTS
What’s going on Do you smell fire
Where are my pants

Before long everyone’s awake Christina stops the
flamethrower Waves under the fire alarm until it stops

CHRISTINA
OKAY PEOPLE ALL EYES ON ME

Everyone looks at her She hops off the couch Paces
like a coach giving a halftime speech

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
There was a problem at the science
weekend and it looks like our kids are
coming home That wouldn’t be a problem
if you all didn’t wreck my beautiful home
last night Now By my estimation it’s
gonna take twenty hours to clean this
place We have two And I will be
damned if Adam and I are gonna do it
alone

John raises his hand

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
No questions

Amy makes a bummed John put his hand down

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
So go throw up drink some water put on
some pants whatever you need to do to
get ready to help us get this house back
in a presentable shape so our son has no
clue about last night As we all proved
here we are all a bunch of pretty big
fuck ups but I believe we’re
all heroes too Because every day in
every way we shield our kids our
beautiful well-adjusted kids from
knowing just how big of fuck ups we are
And trust me we are all pretty big fuck
ups Every one of us

(MORE )

CHRISTINA (CONTD)
But I will be damned if my kid or any of
yours find that out today You hear me
They will not find that out today Not
while we can still do something about it
