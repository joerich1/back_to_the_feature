police hav3 got a completely erroneous impression of him

Barry looks at him with a slightly suspicious ox-
pression Mr Tobin continues

Tobin
I can assure you that contrary to what is generally sup-
posed and to what he himself may have told you this young
man is not one of his countrys onomies -- and lmows nothing
whatever about the subtle art of industrial destruction «-
I believe they call it sabotage -
