his jacket closed against the cold goes around to

THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING

Which we can now see is THE NOEL TOWN BANK

INT NOEL TOWN BANK - NIGHT

Where we see the DOOR to the VAULT is wide open Chris mops
the floor as the manager MR TUTTLE -- heavyset in a ten-year-

old brown suit -- pulis the door closed moves to a small metal
door mounted on the wall and opens it

Michael Peretzian

Three COMBINATION DIALS are inside The door is on a spring-

hinge so Mr Tuttle has to hold it open while he sets each of
the dials He sets one then sees is standing there

CHRIS
Youre working late

MR
Turn around please
Chris turns his back as Mr Tuttle sets the other two dials

CHRIS
The USDA money must be coming
Mr Tuttle looks at him Chris smiles says by rote

CHRIS
It comes twice a year once for pre-
planting and again in harvesting

MR TUTTLE
How do you know about that

CHRIS

subsidy checks went out and that well
Y

full of post-its and notebooks Photographs of a younger Chris
and a BLONDE in Polynesian outfits standing in front of a fake
beach backdrop is in a HOCKEY uniform Chris and his
FATHER both with shotguns under their arms

CHRIS
One second--

Mr Tuttle watches impatiently as Chris opens the drawer --
more notebooks in here -- rifies through them until he finds
the one hes looking for flips back a few pages as he walks

over to Mr Tuttle and starts to read stammering slightly

Michael Peretzian

CHRIS
A good teller is primarily a good
counter A teller counts and keeps
track of money all day long taking
eare to keep the corners on bills turned
straight and facing the same way

Mr Tuttle checks his watch shifts his weight doesnt bother
to hide how antsy he is to get the hell out of there

CHRIS
At the end of the day the teller
balances the cash in the drawer against
the pa -out tickets Now is really
the test of a good teller good
teller can go for years without bein
out of balance Mrs Lange says shes
never been out of balance yet

Mr Tuttle rolls his eyes at that one

CHRIS
But Of course the real key to being
a good teller is a friendly personality
Thats how you get customers to en a
new account or buy a CD or something
The motto of a good teller is Be
friendly and accurate
(looks up at Mr Tuttle)
But mostly be accurate

Mr Tuttle stares at C Moment then--

ROM SOMEWHERE ELSE

LUVLEE spiky hair an extra large Pep-Boys t-shirt and pink
panties -- puts a CELLPHONE down on the counter then moves
about the room bopping to the music while fixing a tray of food
(bologna sandwich cookies milk)

As she gets on her toes and reaches for something on a high
shelf her t-shirt hikes up and we see a SMALL PISTOL tucked
into the back of her panties the muzzle evidently nestled nice
and warm between her cheeks On her feet she wears a pair of
work boots protection against all the bolts and screws

Yessiree Our kind of gizi She picks up the tray and starts
out of the room We follow her through the maze of debris-strewn
hallways Twice she has to stop retrace her steps

LUVLEE
Oh fuck me

She passes a room set up as a kind of bedroom Down this hall

then that one Into another room where bright sunlight streams
in through the windows

Michael Peretzian

Luvlee bops over to the counter takes A KEY RING FROM OUT OF A
COFFEE arops it on the tray and starts back out

She walks down the hall to the next room starts to unlock the
door as we then

CUT TO INSIDE THE ROOM

The MUSIC IS DEAFENING IN HERE Mattresses cover the windows
A bare bulb illuminates wis si ni hi is hands
covering his ears As in the rest of the place a 4 around him
the floor is littered with bolts and screws

A clearing has been swept away for him to sit in the center
of the floor while a path in the shrapnel leads to a toilet

Behind him we see the door slowly swing open on its own A
moment later we see LUVLEES LEG teasingly extend into
the doorway The rest of her as in some bad strip routine
slowly following

Lewis for his part remains totally unaware his senses too
preoccupied with the musical assaul coming from the stereo
Speakers mounted high up on the walls out of his reach

Now Luvlees dancing with the tray moving closer to Lewis
She sets it down right in front of his face

He smells the food reaches out and touches the tray Alert
now he straightens up

T

Luvlee stands nearby wat as he reaches out and touches
the floor nearby le feels ag ze it makes as it settles

his face He turns his head this way and that as he gets a
whiff of her senses her moving past him

EWIS

She pulls a PURPLE SCARF from one of her boots now and begins
twirling it about and then finally blindfolds Lewis with it

LEWIS
Ha Ha

She kisses him on the top of the head picks up her shirt dances
her way back out of the room The MUSIC STOPS She reappears
a moment later pulling her shirt back on
