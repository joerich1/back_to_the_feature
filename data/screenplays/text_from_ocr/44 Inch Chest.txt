44 INCH CHEST

PROLOGUE

Stagnant black water Greasy Pitch Thick Oily

Dense Heavy Lapping Slow A desolate canal Night

Onto dark stones rain-slicked darkest slate-grey cobbles

And on through streets Narrow Grimy Sooty
Rank

Deserted

Pastal-disused Victorian broken-windowed derelict
buildings and wharf side warehouses with rotten oaky loading

beams and rusted iron chains Mossy mildewed walls Dripping
fetid water from corroded dilapidated ancient ruined

guttering

Moving Turning Into a pinched arched alleyway -- If
anything darker blacker Foreboding Forsaken

And if we listen -- If we strain our ears -- listen -- we can
hear music -- faint Ghostly Haunting Take Me Back To

Dear O1 Blighty as if sung by a jolly girl in a long gone
bar surrounded by drunken men

We keep moving The music growing In the distance a faint
glow Dirty-yellow diffused misty light We move towards
it Towards the piss-coloured light

We stop In the middle of nowhere Dark nowhere and the
music fades Fades away Vanished Extreme silence All we

have is all we can see

The gable end of an old house Limey-light bleeding weakly
from a broken filthy window All is still -- suddenly it
comes crashing down -- the end wall comes crashing down - a
flurry of bricks and mortar Crashing down The tumble of
masonry And through clouds of brick-dust and rubble we see
figures inside Through a smokey powdered fog we can see a

group of men in the downstairs room of the derelict house
On the walls faded 40s wallpaper peeling in parts to reveal
older dim patterns damp patches A window crudely boarded
up A few unmatched armchairs in various states of disrepair
-- a 60s black vinyl a deco-patterned smoker a 70s cream
plastic a brown wooden kitchen chair etc The colours in
the room are browns greys caramels darks muted

In the middle of the room standing on dusty bare wooden
floorboards his fist clenched aggressively by his sides is

OLD MAN PEANUT aged 80 Skinny Wearing a dark three piece
suit Gold watch chain Black Homburg He is squaring up to
us Staring

Slightly behind to his left sitting nonchalantly cross-

legged in a battered brown leather wingback armchair and

casually smoking a Davidoff cigarette is MEREDITH late

40s Suave Immaculate Wearing black handmade boots black
Saville Row suit black cashmere roll neck sweater herring

bone overcoat with a black velvet collar brown leather

gloves his jet-black hair is heavily brilliantined Behind
him an old wardrobe

Standing with his back three quarters to us and leaning on a
broken chipped mantelpiece over a smashed tiled fireplace

is ARCHIE aged 52 Big Avuncular Wearing a car coat and
casual nondescript clothes he is pouring himself a Captain
Morgans rum from a bottle into a polystyrene cup He sort

of sees us -- is not fussed -- drinks

Standing at the back of the room in front of a door which

has at some time been on fire (its yellowing tobacco-ey
paint charred and blistered) is MAL aged mid-40s Wearing
a silver-grey suit white shirt duck-egg blue silk tie

There is another man in the room but we do not see his face --
for he s its slu mpe d h ead in his han ds in o ne of t he

armchairs - a picture of despair He wears an olive green
shirt brown trousers maroon braces This is COLIN aged
late 40s

Blackness and silence

n the silent black an outsize boot appears - scuffed and
tatty Attached to skinny legs in black tights The legs
gangle and flip pulling into view a bony pasty bare torso
which is undulating oddly -- and here comes the head - Long
lank shoulder length hair Dripping from a white domed pate
- The face poker straight in contrast to the comedic body-
antics -- A grave-grey face -- Fleshy bulbous rubbery
Ladies and Gentlemen -- MAX WALL

He goon-walks about for a bit in the black space Baboon-
bottomed As if knees tied together Aflickin and akickin
his clown boots His unhappy face Like death Prancing
Ridiculous dancing Absurd

Giant CU on his morose contorted phizzog

INT LIVING ROOM DETACHED SUBURBAN VILLA NIGHT

MUSIC “WITHOUT YOU by NILSSON
We are out of focus on purple white scattered sparkling
jewels begin to come into focus and we see that they are
in fact pieces of broken glass Thousands of splinters and
shards strewn across a purple Wilton carpet the white fur
of a luxurious sheepskin rug in bits Ripped to shreds In
extreme CU we begin to move along the floor slowly taking in
mor e de bri s of d est ru ct ion Sm as he dc ha ir s Sm
as he d
photographs Broken records Ripped shredded record
sleeves -- “THE POWER OF LOVE by JENNIFER RUSH -- “HOPELESSLY
DEVOTED TO YOU by OLIVIA NEWTON JOHN -- “I WILL ALWAYS LOVE
YOU by WHITNEY HOUSTON etc

The TV remote smashed to smithereens The television --
widescreen -- TOTALLED We move along the plush “World of
Leather leather sofa See that a chunk has been bitten out
of it See teeth marks -- like a bite out of cheese Moving
on past an area of slashed carpet and underfelt Approaching
the legs of a si deboard and see ing into the bla ckness
underneath We can just make out the quizzical frightened
eyes of a white poodle We move on Past twisted wrecked
lampshades Broken plates ornaments An up-ended vase of
half-eaten flowers NILSSON continues his self-pitying
overwrought ballad and as he hits the massive masochistic
choruscrescendo we come across COLIN lying rigid on his back

in the corner of the devastated room His shocked eyes
staring wildly His body petrified Paralysed As if frozen
at the height of an epileptic fit -- Like something from
Pompeii -- Like Max Schrek as Nosferatu hit by light We stay
on COLIN His uncomprehending terror-filled eyes His sheer
rigor mortis-like horror We move in on him Into the black
of his eyes The tragic agonised blac

Suddenly we hear ARCHIES voice

Colin

We now see ARCHIE sitting in a nearby armchair smoking
patient

ARCHIE
Cmon mate you cant lie ‘ere forever

The rigid COLIN ignoring him has suddenly belatedly
realised that the music has stopped Desperately needing his
friend NILSSON -- like a man in excruciating pain reaching
for a gallon of morphine he frantically urgently twists his
body on the floor and reaching behind hammers the play
button on the nearby ghetto blaster And slowly gently
kindly the piano intro of NILSSONS gorgeous wallow re-
commences Colin somewhat soothed eases back into his

ties it off Brutishly dragging the hellish parcel to the
