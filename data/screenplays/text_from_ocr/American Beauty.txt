INT JAIL CELL - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE-UP on a DROP OF WATER gathering at the tip OF
a faucet a FLASH OF LIGHT refracting through it just before
it FALLS

PULLING BACK slowly we see ANOTHER DROP OF WATER gather and

FALL and then ANOTHER into a METAL SINK BASIN filled

with water rippling in concentric circles with each DROP

which we HEAR in a steady rhythm DRIP DRIP DRIP
RICKY (0C)

(singing in time to the
water dripping)
IM FIXING A HOLE WHERE THE
RAIN GETS IN

REVERSE ANGLE on the face OF a YOUNG MAN with his hair cut
short military-style watching the dripping water as if
hypnotized We ZOOM slowly toward him

This is RICKY FITTS Hes twenty but his eyes are much
older Underneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks something
wounded and dangerous He SINGS softly to himself

RICKY (contd)
AND STOPS MY MIND FROM
WANDERING

Through the bars OF his CELL we see RICKY is seated on the
edge of a solitary cot in a JAIL CELL staring intently at the
metal sink on the wall across from him

RICKY (contd)
WHERE IT WILL GO

clipboards lowlifes being booked The usual

The front door opens and COLONEL FRANK FITTS enters carrying
a MANILA ENVELOPE Hes fifty quite handsome his graying
hair cut short military-style He still moves like the
athlete he once was but his eyes tell us hes not happy and

Fleishman

INT POLICE STATION - DETECTIVES OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

DETECTIVE FLEISHMAN paunchy and constantly exhausted opens
the door to his office and motions Colonel Fitts inside

FLEISHMAN
Colonel Pitts How goes it

He shows the COLONEL to a chair then sits behind his desk

FLEISHMAN (contd)
So what can I do for you

The COLONEL sighs looking at the MANILA ENVELOPE He holds
COLONEL
I found something I think you

FLEISHMAN
Okay

YESTERDAY

FADE to BLACK

In darkness we HEAR Vic Damone singing IM NOBODYS BABY
as the words ONE YEAR EARLIER FADE IN AND OUT

FADE IN
EXT SUBURB - EARLY MORNING

Were FLYING high above an upper middle class SUBURB The
wide streets are lined with stately elms and sycamores the
homes are traditional and well-kept Coming closer to the
ground we pick out a couple of male JOGGER

A DIFFERENT ANGLE on the Joggers Were at level now MOVING
alongside them Theyre both in their thirties athletic
blandly handsome They pass a STREET SIGN that reads Robin
Hood Trail

Suddenly a MAN comes into view FLYING Superman-style about
three feet above their heads Hes wearing old-fashioned
PAJAMAS and a plaid flannel ROBE As he passes overhead the
Joggers look up and wave excitedly like children He flashes
them a grin and waves back then he speeds up leaving them
behind
As the MAN flies down the street a BARKING DOG runs along
beneath him jumping into the air trying to catch him The
Man swoops and dips effortlessly teasing the dog then spots
at the end of the street a young boy on a bicycle tossing
newspapers onto peoples porches or as close as he can get
Seeing the flying Man the boy tosses a paper high into the
air The dog tears off to catch the paper The flying Man
LAUGHS and shoots upward like hes been blown out of a cannon
grabs the paper and swoops down dropping it lightly on the
front porch of a well-appointed two-story HOUSE with
distinctive CEDAR SHINGLE SIDING and a RED FRONT DOOR

The boy on the bike watches IN admiration the MAN slowly
floats by above him and tousles his hair The dog BARKS The
boy throws another newspaper into the air this time even
higher than before and the Man grins as he prepares to shoot
up after it this is going to be fun and we SMASH CUT TO

INT BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

We HEAR the harsh BUZZ OF an ALARM CLOCK Vic Damone still
sings IM NOBODYS BABY elsewhere in the house Outside a
dog is still BARKING

The MAN we just saw FLYING Through the streets lies sleeping
amidst expensive bed linens wearing the same PAJAMAS His
hand reaches over and shuts the ALARM CLOCK OFF his eyes
remain clamped shut as he tries to hang onto his dream but
its gone He sighs and opens his eyes

This man is LESTER BURNHAM Carolyns husband and Janes
father Hes forty-two with a wide boyish face thats just
beginning to droop around the edges He sits up in bed and
rubs his face

Were in a large comfortable bedroom thats tastefully
decorated but not overdone - it could be a spread from
Metropolitan Home Lester gets out of the king-sized bed
crosses to a bay window covered with stylish wooden blinds
lifts one of the slats with his finger and peers through it

His POV A DOG - the same dog from Lesters flying dream -
BARKS excitedly at us from behind a white picket fence
surrounding the front yard of the house across the street

EXT BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The dogs POV Lester looks down at us through the bay window
of the HOUSE from his dream - we recognize the distinctive
CEDAR SHINGLE SIDING The dog continues to BARK

LESTER (VO)
My name is Lester Burnham Im
forty two-years old In less than a
year Ill be dead
INT BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER
Were in the shower with Lester A waterproof RADIO plays
COUNTRY MUSIC He stands with his face directly in the hot
sprayl eyes shut

LESTER (VO)
In a way Im dead already

ANGLE from outside the shower we see Lesters naked body
silhouetted through the steamed-up glass door It becomes
apparent he is masturbating

LESTER (VO) (contd)
(amused)
Look at me jerking off while I
listen to country music I hated
this shit when I was growing up
(then)
Funny thing is this is the high
point of my day Its all downhill
from here

EXT BURNHAM HOUSE front YARD - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE on a single dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE perfect IN
shape and color As we PULL BACK a pair of gloved hands with
CLIPPERS appear and SNIP the flower off

We continue PULLING BACK to discover Carolyn BURNHAM IN her
rose garden in front of the house cutting flowers and placing
them in a basket a determined humorless look on her face
Even now she is perfectly put-together she wears color-
coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and
expensive tools

LESTER (VO)
Thats my wife Carolyn See the
way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs
Thats not an accident

In the fenced front YARD OF the HOUSE across the street the
familiar dog is still BARKING A well-groomed athletic MAN in
a conservative suit rolls a blue plastic city GARBAGE
CONTAINER up the driveway to the curb

JIM 1
Bitsy Hush

LESTER (VO)
Thats our next-door neighbor Jim

A second well-groomed athletic MAN IN a conservative suit
comes out the front door

JIM 2
What in the world is wrong with
her She had a walk this morning
JIM 1
And a jerky treat

JIM 2
(frowns)
You spoil her

LESTER (VO)
(re the second man)
And thats his lover Jim

We recognize the two Jims as the joggers from Lesters dream

JIM 2
(sternly)
Bitsy No bark Come inside Now

Bitsy suddenly subdued allows Jim 2 to usher her inside

LESTER (VO)
Its weird they have the same
name but thats really no fault of
their own

As Jim 2 gets into a Ford Taurus Jim 1 crosses the street
to greet Carolyn

JIM 1
Morning Carolyn

CAROLYN
(overly friendly)
Good morning Jim I just love
your tie That color

JIM 1
And I just love your roses How
do you get them to flourish like
that

CAROLYN
Well Ill tell you Egg shells
and Miracle Grow

ANGLE on the second floor bay window of the Burnhams house
where Lester stands in a bathrobe drying his hair as he looks
down at them

LESTER (VO)
Man I get exhausted just watching
her

His POV We cant hear what theyre saying but Carolyns
facial expressions remain overly animated and cheerful like
those of a TV talk show host
LESTER (VO) (contd)
She wasnt always like this She
used to be happy We used to be
happy

Jim 2 pulls the Ford Taurus into the street Jim 1 waves to
Carolyn jumps inside and they drive off Carolyn immediately
reverts to her previous resolute expression as she continues
cutting flowers

LESTER (VO) (contd)
But she doesnt have much use for
me anymore About the only thing
that gets her excited now is money

INT BURNHAM HOUSE - JANES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on a young womans hands counting DOLLAR BILLS PULLING
BACK we see JANE BURNHAM seated at a desk in her bedroom
wearing jeans and a tight cotton top with straps As she
counts she has the same resolute expression as her mother

LESTER (VO)
And this is my daughter Jane
Only child She takes after her
mother in a lot of ways although
shed never admit it

Having finished counting JANE paper-clips the money together
then types something into a computer

CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR Personal banking software
We see the word DEPOSIT and the amount 3800 as theyre
entered then a new total in the balance column 285306

JANE smiles pleased she stuffs the money into a KNAPSACK
hanging on her closet door then looks at herself in a full-
length MIRROR A beat she turns sideways and arches her back
so her breasts protrude as much as possible She frowns then
turns so shes facing the mirror and hugs her herself
tightly to enhance the appearance of cleavage

LESTER (VO) (contd)
Janie is a pretty typical
teenager Angry insecure
confused I wish I could tell her
all thats going to pass
(then)
But I dont want to lie to her

We HEAR a CAR HORN from outside JANE grabs her KNAPSACK and
a too-large flannel shirt from her closet and starts out

EXT BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOS

A bright blue GARBAGE TRUCK fills the screen as its
MECHANICAL ARM lifts a matching blue city GARBAGE CONTAINER
from the curb emptying its contents into the truck On the
side of the truck

CITY OF ROCKWELL
DEPARTMENT OF SANITATION
Lets Recycle

In the Burnhams driveway Carolynl now dressed for work in a
completely different but equally well-coordinated outfit
stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ ML320
reaching in through the drivers window to blow the HORN
again

Her POV LESTER comes out the front door dressed IN a
business suit and carrying a briefcase fumbling with his tie
Jane is close behind him buttoning her flannel shirt her
knapsack slung over her shoulder

Carolyn frowns at both OF them

CAROLYN
Jane Honey Are you trying to
look unattractive

JANE
Yes

CAROLYN
Well congratulations Youve
succeeded admirably

Lesters briefcase suddenly springs open his papers and
files spilling onto the driveway As he drops to his knees to
gather everything Jane sidesteps around him

JANE
Nice going Dad

LESTER looks UP her sheepishly then at Carolyn

His POV she looks down at us slightly contemptuous But also
bored as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago

LESTER
I keep meaning to get this thing
fixed

He smiles trying to lighten the moment but Carolyns
expression doesnt change She opens the door and gets into
the drivers seat Jane takes the passenger seat and Lester
climbs into the back The Mercedes-Benz ML320 starts to slowly
back out of the driveway

LESTER (VO) (contd)
So thats my family and this is
my life
(laughs)
Youd think I wouldnt miss it so
much

INT MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - a SHORT TIME LATER

Carolyn is driving Jane stares out the window Lester is
asleep in the back seat Clint Black sings DESPERADO on the
STEREO

JANE
Why are we listening to this
whiny-ass music

CAROLYN
Its just what was on

JANE fiddles the tuner searching FOR ANOTHER station
Something suddenly catches Carolyns eye

Her POV An ADVERTISEMENT on a BUS STOP BENCH shows a slick-
looking silver- MAN smiling a toothy smile It reads
Leonard Kane - The Real Estate King - Rockwells Highest Sales
Record Three Years Straight We recognize him as the man
seated next to Carolyn in court during Janes trial

Carolyn glare at the ADVERTISEMENT as she drives past it
obviously bothers her

JANE
I dont see how you people can
listen to that hillbilly crap It
makes me want to buy a gun and
shoot up a Burger King

CAROLYN
Well your father was the last one
to drive this car You know I
dont like country music myself
Its so common and twangy I
much prefer the old b)V
standards Sinatra Bobby Darin
Doris Day

JANE Finally finds a STATION she likes MOODY ALTERNATIVE
ROCK They drive along without speaking for a moment then

JANE
Wake up Dad were here

No response from Lester

JANE (contd)
Dad look Its Garth Brooks and
hes wearing that groovy cowboy
hat Maybe you can get his
autograph

CAROLYN
(chuckling)
Jane Hush

INT COMMUTER TRAIN - a SHORT TIME LATER

LESTER sits IN the crowded TRAIN his head UP against the
window Hes fast asleep

LESTER (VO)
Both my wife and my daughter think

He has a paper CUP OF COFFEE IN one hand haphazardly holding
it against his knee Slowly it tips over spilling onto his
pants leg He remains asleep

LESTER (VO) (contd)
And theyre right Ive lost
something very important Im not
exactly sure what it is but I know

Finally LESTER opens one eye

POV from the front of the PATH train Were ZOOMING along
aboveground unnaturally FAST heading toward a TUNNEL

LESTER (VO) (contd)
But you know what Its never too
late to get it back

And we accelerate into the tunnel and BLACKNESS

INT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

CLOSE on a COMPUTER MONITOR SCROLLING COPY Its MOVING by
too quickly for us to read but we can make out WORDS here and
there marketing profits strategy etc

Lester sits at his workstation in a BEIGE CUBICLE
surrounded by several IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES Hes staring
at the monitor and talking on a HEADSET PHONE The light
friendly tone of his voice is at odds with the beleaguered
expression on his face

LESTER
Hello this is Lester Burnham from
Media Monthly magazine calling for

Mr

Keene actually Ive already
left a message about four messages

He punches a button on his keyboard then turns to Brad
smiling perfunctorily

BRAD
Les Got a minute

LESTER

BRAD

office
He smiles and crosses off LESTER watches him go frowning

INT BRADS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
BRAD is seated behind his desk

BRAD

the need to cut corners around
here

Lester sits across from him scowling like a teenager whos
been sent to the principals office

LESTER
Sure Times are tight and you
need to free up cash Gotta spend
money to make money

BRAD
Exactly

BRAD stands ready to usher LESTER out But LESTER remains
seated

LESTER

(blurts)
Like when our editorial director
used the company MasterCard to pay
for a hooker and then she used the
card number to stay at the St
Regis for what was it three
months

BRAD
(startled)
Thats unsubstantiated gossip

LESTER
Thats fifty thousand dollars
Thats somebodys salary Somebody
whos probably gonna get fired
because Craig has to pay women to
fuck him

BRAD
Jesus Calm down Nobodys getting
fired yet Thats why were having
everyone write a job description
mapping out in detail how they
contribute That way management
can assess whos valuable and whos

LESTER
Expendable

BRAD
Its just business

LESTER
(angry)
Ive been writing for this
magazine for fourteen years Brad

trying to level with you This is
your one chance to save your job

LESTER leans BACK IN his chair incredulous
INT COMMUTER TRAIN - a SHORT TIME LATER

Once again LESTER sits IN the crowded TRAIN his head UP
against the window But this time hes not asleep he glares
darkly out at the tunnel walls as they fly by

EXT BURNHAM HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

The MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 pulls into the driveway driven By
Carolyn A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the pale blue
COLONIAL HOUSE next door A couple of Movers carry a couch
down the driveway toward the house

As LESTER and Carolyn get out OF the ML320 and head toward
their front door

CAROLYN
There is no decision Just write
the damn thing
LESTER
You dont think its weird and
kinda fascist

CAROLYN
possibly But you dont want to be
unemployed

LESTER

Oh okay Lets all sell our sols
to Satan because its more
convenient that way

CAROLYN
(sighs)
Could you be just a little bit
more dramatic please

Carolyn scopes out the MOVING VAN next door

CAROLYN (contd)

Well Weve finally got new
neighbors Its about time If
the Lomans had let me represent
them instead of

(heavy disdain)
The Real Estate King that house
would have sold within a week
instead of sitting on the market
for six months

LESTER
They were still mad at you for
cutting down their sycamore

CAROLYN
Their sycamore It was on our
property

INT BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

We HEAR John Coltrane and Johnny Hartmans rendition of YOU
ARE TOO BEAUTIFUL on the STEREO

LESTER Carolyn and JANE are seated at dinner IN the formal
dining room They eat by CANDLELIGHT and a profusion of RED
ROSES spills from a vase at the center of the table We CIRCLE
them slowly as they eat Nobody makes eye contact or even
seems aware of anybody elses presence until

JANE
Mom do we always have to listen

to this elevator music

CAROLYN
(considers)
No No we dont As soon as
youve prepared a nutritious yet
flavorful meal that Im about to
eat you can listen to whatever you
like

A long beat LESTER Suddenly turns to Jane

LESTER
So Janie how was school

JANE
(suspicious)

It was okay
LESTER

Just okay
JANE

No Dad It was spec-tac-ular

a beat

LESTER

Want to know how things went at my

job
Now she looks at him as if hes lost his mind

LESTER (contd)
Theyve hired this efficiency
expert Hes really friendly and
I really hate his guts See
theyre going to lay somebody off
but in the interest of being
democratic everybody gets to write
a job description for him in the
hopes the assholes in management
will read it and say Whoa we
cant
do without this guy

He trails off obviously waiting FOR a response from Jane

LESTER (contd)
(finally)
You couldnt possibly care any
less could you

Carolyn is watching This closely

JANE
(uncomfortable)
Dad what do you expect You cant
all of a sudden be my best friend
just because youve got a problem
She gets UP and heads toward the kitchen

JANE (contd)
I mean hello Youve barely even
spoken to me for months

Shes gone Lester notices Carolyn looking at him
critically

LESTER
Oh what youre mother-of-the-
year You treat her like a
employee

JANE turns and stares at him waiting FOR him to finish

LESTER (contd)

EXT BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
ON VIDEO Were looking at Lester and Jane through GREENHOUSE

WINDOWS into the kitchen We cant hear what theyre saying
but its obvious its not going well Jane puts her plate in
the dishwasher and leaves We follow her out the door then
the camera JERKS back to Lester calling after her

CLOSE on the LENS OF a high-tech portable VIDEO CAMERA as we
PULL BACK the camera drops down to reveal RICKY FITTS whom
we recognize as the young man in jail at the beginning His
short hair and starched clothes give him a hyper-conservative
appearance We linger on his placid face for a moment
then

INT BURNHAM - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

LESTER stands at the sink rinsing off his plate his face
dark His head suddenly jerks up and he looks out the window
as if he realizes he s being watched

His POV Were looking at the pint where Ricky was just
standing but hes no longer there

LESTER frowns then turns off the faucet grabs a towel and
dries his hands He tosses the towel on the snack bar on his
way out where it lands next to a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH

We ZOOM slowly toward the PHOTOGRAPH Its of Lester
Carolyn and a much-younger Jane taken several years earlier
at an amusement park Its starling how happy they look

We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE
INT high SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

Were at a high-school BASKETBALL GAME Teenage boys mostly
black play a fast and furious game One team dressed in
light blue and white uniforms scores a basket The CROWD goes
wild

Seated IN the bleachers next to the high SCHOOL BAND is a
group of about twenty teenage girls dressed in short light
blue and white uniforms that manage to be both revealing and
chaste Among them Jane sits next to ANGELA HAYES whom we
recognize from the witness stand at the beginning Jane stands
and scans the bleachers

ANGELA
Who are you looking for

steps for weeks

LESTER
Well I bet you money shes going

the James Bond marathon on TNT

CAROLYN

between you and Jane

LESTER

The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays TOP OF THE WORLD On the gym
floor the girls perform synchronized dance steps smiling
energetically Theyre well-rehearsed but too young to carry
off the ambitious Vegas routine theyre attempting

LESTER watching from the stands picks out his daughter

His POV JANE performs well concentrating hard Dancing next
to her is Angela she moves awkwardly grace obviously not
being her strong point Suddenly she looks right us and
smiles a lazy insolent smile

LESTER leans forward IN his seat

His POV Were focused on Angela now Everything starts to
SLOW DOWN almost imperceptibly the MUSIC acquires an eerie
ECHO and she keeps sneaking knowing looks at us

We ZOOM slowly toward LESTER as He watches transfixed

His POV The light on Angela is brighter than on the others
somehow and her awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace TOP
OF THE WORLD FADES into dreamy hypnotic TRIPHOP MUSIC The
light on Angela grows even stronger and the other girls
around her DISAPPEAR entirely

LESTER is spellbound

His POV ANGELA looks directly at us Now Dancing ONLY FOR
Lester Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as the
MUSIC increases in intensity She starts to seductively unzip
her uniform teasing us with an expression thats both

innocent and knowing then she pulls her uniform OPEN and a
profusion of RED ROSES spills forth and we SMASH CUT TO
INT HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

ANGELA fully clothed is Once again surrounded By the other

it If people I dont even know

She plugs IN the BOOMBOX presses a button and we HEAR Tony
Bennett singing WITH PLENTY OF MONEY AND YOU which plays
throughout the following

MONTAGE
We see Carolyn working with
fierce concentration as she
Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen Perches on a
stepladder to dust a cheap-looking white ceiling fan in the
mater bedroom Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and
pool Skims leaves off the surface of the pool Sweeps the
patio with a broom And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never
be clean

Throughout all this she keeps repeating to herself

against her will Suddenly she SLAPS herself hard

CAROLYN

lights up at what he finds

A pair OF DUMBBELLS obviously unused FOR many years

LESTER rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt
He glances around finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he
pulls off his shirt then the T-shirt underneath

He eyes himself critically Angela was right hes not in bad
shape Naturally broad-shouldered with just a few extra
pounds around his middle that wouldnt be hard to shed He
kicks off his shoes and begins to step out of his pants

The Manger frowns unconvinced

LESTER (contd)
Should you choose not to hire me
I have to assume its because of my
age which I can only interpret as
discrimination and would have to
take up with my attorney

wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this

You think youre not obvious You
sit in front of your mirror
wondering what it would be like to
be beautiful like Angela But the
truth is youre more beautiful
than shell ever be Because youre
more real Because you

He starts to SING IN a clear deep voice

RICKY (contd)
YOU LIGHT UP MY LIFE

JANE stares at him unsure whether she should laugh or run

RICKY (contd)
YOU GIVE ME HOPE TO CARRY ON

She Finally LAUGHS He lowers the camera and smiles

RICKY (contd)
Want to see the most beautiful
thing Ive ever filmed

INT FITTS HOUSE - RICKYS BEDROOM - LATER

On VIDEO were IN an empty parking lot on a cold gray day
Something is floating across from us its an empty
wrinkled white PLASTIC BAG We follow it as the wind carries
it in a circle around us sometimes whipping it about
violently or without warning sending it soaring skyward
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground

Jane sits on the bed She watches Rickys WIDE-SCREEN TV
her brow furrowed trying to figure out why this is beautiful

From a chair across the ROOM RICKY watches smiling

RICKY
It was one of those days when its
a minute away from snowing and
theres this electricity in the
air you can almost hear it right
And this bag was like dancing with
me Like a little kid begging me
to play with it For fifteen
minutes And thats the day I knew
there was this entire life behind
things and this incredibly
benevolent force that wanted me to
know there was no reason to be
afraid Ever

A beat

RICKY (contd)
Videos a poor excuse But it
helps me remember and I need to
remember

Now JANE is watching him

RICKY (contd)
(distant)
Sometimes theres so much beauty
in the world I feel like I cant
take it like my hearts going to
cave in

He points a REMOTE at the TV and switches it off then just
sits there lost in thought not unlike his mother

After a moment JANE gets up RICKY watches impassively as

she kneels in front of him and takes his hands and kisses
them Then she leans up and kisses him softly on the lips His
eyes scan hers curious to see how she reacts to this

JANE
(suddenly)
Oh my God What time is it

INT BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

We HEAR Jack Jones singing YOUD BETTER LOVE ME Lester is
seated at the dining table in a T-shirt and jeans eating his
dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle Across
from him Carolyn picks at her food watching him with
contempt He HEAR the back door SLAM then Jane enters and
quickly takes her seat at the table

JANE
Sorry Im late

CAROLYN
Thats quite all right dear
Your father and I were just
discussing his day at work
(to Lester)
Why dont you tell our daughter
about it honey

JANE stares at both her parents apprehensive LESTER looks
at Carolyn darkly then flashes a you-asked-for-it grin

LESTER
Janie today I quit my job I also
told my boss to fuck himself and
then blackmailed him for almost
sixty-thousand dollars Pass the
asparagus

CAROLYN
Your father seems to think this
kind of behavior is something to be
proud of

LESTER
And your mother seems to prefer I
go through life like a fucking
prisoner while she keeps my dick in
a mason jar under the sink

CAROLYN
(ashen)
How dare you speak to me like that
in front of her

LESTER
Will someone please pass me the
asparagus

CAROLYN
(to Lester)
I hope you dont think for one
minute Im going to support you

LESTER
I already have another job

JANE
(rises
Okay guys Im not going to be a
part of this

LESTER
(means it)
Sit down

JANE does So immediately surprised and intimidated By the

power in her fathers voice Lester gets up crosses to the
other side of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS then sits

again as he serves himself

LESTER (contd)

CAROLYN
(overlapping)
Do you really think -

LESTER hurls the plate OF asparagus
such force it SHATTERS frightening

LESTER

Dont interrupt me honey

He goes BACK to eating his meal as

against the wall with
Carolyn and Jane

if nothing unusual has
happened Carolyn sits in her chair

shivering with rage Jane

just stares at the plate in front of her YOUD BETTER LOVE

ME continues to play on the STEREO

clumsily Shes obviously embarrassed but shes gone this far
and theres no turning back She stands there with her breasts
exposed trying to look defiant but shes achingly
vulnerable We continue ZOOMING toward her face as close as
we can get to the desperate yearning in her eyes

Suddenly the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters
incensed carrying his KEYS Startled Ricky turns around As
soon as his eyes meet his fathers he knows whats up

RICKY

through the trees in front of us SOMETHING OUT OF FOCUS
crosses by in front us obscuring our view We slowly ZOOM
back and see that its Jane or rather just a corner of her
face as she looks at us her eyes shining Her hand brushes
the hair off her face and we stay on her hand It swings back
and forth gracefully she walks ahead in front of us we JUMP
CUT to

ON VIDEO CLOSE on Janes naked calves her jeans rolled up
as she dangles her feet in a pond The water RIPPLES in
concentric circles every time she dips her toes in not unlike
the water in the jail cell sink at the beginning we JUMP
CUT to

the opposite direction so that we see only FLASHES OF HER
RUNNING by LAUGHING JUMP CUT to

On VIDEO JANE IN profile looking toward the sky her yes
shut enjoying the sun on her face

Jesus youre beautiful

She looks at us and smiles her guard down her face empty OF
its usual vaguely contemptuous expression and indeed she is
beautiful young happy hopeful We linger on her face for a
moment She brings her hand up to caress her cheek and then
still smiling she slowly flips us the bird we JUMP CUT to

ON VIDEO Were looking at Janes SHADOW clearly delineated
by the bright sun against a textured carpet of fallen leaves
on the forest floor We HEAR her GIGGLE as she makes shadow
puppets with her hand then we MOVE around so that were
looking up at her silhouetted against the Bun Even though we
cant make out her features this image seems transcendent
almost religious

ON VIDEO Jane in Rickys bed naked She quickly pulls a
sheet up over her breasts

JANE
(shy)
Don t

PULLING BACK we see weve been watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV
in Rickys room

A CORD leads from the TV to Rickys VIDEO CAMERA Ricky holds

couple of slight SCARS on his face Hes focusing his camera
on Jane whos lying in his bed We see her image on the TV

Well of course I got kicked out
Dad and I had this huge fight and
he hit me and then the next day
at school some kid made a crack
about my haircut and I just
snapped I wanted to kill him And
I would have if they hadnt pulled
me off him

(then)
Thats when my dad put me in the
hospital They drugged me up and I
was
there for almost two years

JANE
You must really hate him

RICKY
Hes not really a bad man Hes
just one of those people who needs
everybody to make the same choices
he did So he can feel good about
himself

JANE
Yeah but you lost two whole years
of your life

RICKY
I didnt lose them It taught me
how to step back and just
watch and not take everything so
personally And thats something I
needed to learn Thats something
everybody needs to learn

He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and LIGHTS it

JANE
Well you better believe Id
hate my father if he did something
like that
to me
(laughs)

Wait I do hate my father

RICKY
Why

He passes her the JOINT then takes the camera and focuses it
on her We see her image on the TV as he videotapes

near as important to him as she is

JANE

the TV screen goes BLUE He lowers the camera and looks at
her intently

JANE (contd)

He puts the camera down and joins JANE on the bed a long
moment where neither of them speaks He caresses her hair
gazing into her eyes Jane touches one of the scars on his
face He smiles

body

even look at him As she rinses out a coffee cup Lester
leans against the counter drinking his shake directly form
the blender pitcher eyeing her Hes got newfound sexual
energy that makes her uncomfortable and he knows it Carolyn
quickly dries off the coffee cup and starts out

time like youre drunk Its
disgusting

A beat
LESTER
If you dont watch out youre
going to turn into a real bitch

but he doesnt discover its false bottom He stands and looks
around his eyes finally landing on

A stack of HI-8 VIDEOCASSETTES next to Rickys computer

eyes are blank like Janes

INT FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

BARBARA stands at an ironing board ironing a WHITE T-shirt
She HUMS softly as she meticulously folds the T-shirt and
places it atop a stack of equally obsessively folded clothing
She then reaches into a laundry basket and gets another T-
SHIRT to iron

CLOSE on her hands as she spreads the T-shirt out on the
ironing board its FLECKED WITH DRIED BLOOD

BARBARA stops HUMMING confused she stares at the shirt FOR
a long beat then glances around opens a kitchen drawer and
stuffs the T-shirt inside She then resumes ironing without
humming

CLOSE on RICKY staring at us smiling we HEAR WATER
DRIPPING steadily We start PULLING BACK

RICKY
(singing softly)
AND IT REALLY DOESNT MATTER IF
IM WRONG IM RIGHT

His POV we ZOOM slowly toward the faucet as drops OF WATER
gather at the tip A FLASH OF LIGHT refracting through each
one momentarily before it falls as WE GET CLOSER time
seems to SLOW DOWN an the last drop we see seems huge a
shining sphere filled with LIGHT

And beauty

RICKY (contd)
WHERE I BELONG IM RIGHT WHERE
I BELONG

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

ON VIDEO Were watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier
of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about The wind
carries it in a circle around us sometimes whipping it about
violently or without warning sending it soaring skyward
then letting it float gracefully down to the ground

LESTER (VO)
I guess I could be pretty pissed
of f about what happened to me
but its hard to stay mad when
theres so much beauty in the
world Sometimes I feel like Im
seeing it all at once and its too
much my heart fills up like a
balloon thats about to burst

EXT SKY - DAY
LESTER continues to FLY above the clouds LAUGHING

LESTER (VO)
And then I remember to relax and
stop trying to hold on to it and
then it flows through me like rain
and I cant feel anything but
gratitude for every single moment
of my stupid little life

Hes SOARING higher and higher
LESTER (VO) (contd)
You have no idea what Im talking
about Im sure but dont
worry

And He SOARS out OF sight

LESTER (VO) (contd)
