whole scene lying down

NICK
I dont know that seems a little

PALOMINO
Hey Im just throwing out ideas
here Trying to get the juices
flowing

NICK
Nicole how does that feel to you

speaks
to the crew in general

Well pause to set this light and go

watches this

emotion

for the scene Everyone watches her in complete
silence

Palomino tiptoes over to the camera where Wanda and the

Scriptgirl are standing side by side As he leans
between

them checking his lines on the Scriptgirls script he
inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh

some

involuntary smile Meanwhile the Scriptgirl turns
blushing furiously

Nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror

closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his
falls over his ear then steps back to examine himself

NICK

Suddenly the door opens behind him and Nicole walks in

NICOLE
Oh Nick Im sorry

of blows

NICK

confidentially

PALOMINO
It sounds like the champagne talking

NICOLE
Ive loved you from the moment we
met

PALOMINO

Why didnt you tell me

sets the machine in standby mode and picks up his
puzzle Nicole is just about to take off the headphones
she realizes she can hear Nick and Palomino talking
clearly Glancing up she sees the Boom man has left
boom leaning against the wall the mike pointing out
open set window

PALOMINO (VO)
Why did you cast her She sucked in
that Richard Gere movie

NICK (V0O)
Youre right She is not the best
actress in the world I see that now
but youve got to help me Chad Im
asking you to please help me here
Weve got to get through this somehow

The camera begins a slow DOLLY in to Nicoles

face This will be intercut with a similar DOLLY in to
microphone leaning against the wall ending in an ECU
mike

INT OFF THE SET DAY

Camera is close on Nick and Palomino

PALOMINO
Ill tell you what this is about
man You know why she took a cab
this morning

NICK
Something came up

PALOMINO
No She was in my hotel room and she
didnt want you to know it OK Im
sorry it had to come out like this
but I told her this morning thanks
a lot it was a lot of fun last night
but lets get something straight --
it was just a one-time deal and
she didnt want to hear that She
wanted more you see what Im saying
Its rejection

INT THE SET DAY

The camera reveals Nicole now seated in her spot on the
bed

She rises as Nick and Palomino reappear and approach
her
from behind the set

NICK
Nicole listen

NICOLE
Nick its my fault the scene isnt
working I apologize Chad I
apologize to you too Im completely
unfocused here and I think youre
absolutely right what we need to do
is loosen the scene up somehow

Nick and Palomino stare at Nicole for a moment

NICK
What would you like to do

NICOLE
I was wondering if we could try
improvising the scene More along
the lines of what Chad has been doing
Maybe that would help me find
something

Nicks smile of gratitude to Nicole looks almost drug-
induced

NICK
Thats a fantastic idea What do you
think Chad

PALOMINO
Hey thats the only way I can work
Lets take it apart lets cut loose

NICK
Good And well shoot it Hell why

not

PALOMINO

say Damian

PALOMINO

Well I am surprised you feel this
way Ellen I always thought you

admired --

NICOLE

Thats not what I meant You should
tell everyone what you just told

Nick behind the set

PALOMINO

Hey this isnt part of the scene
NICOLE
Say it anyway The reason this scene
isnt working is because you and I
slept together last night Did
everyone hear that I fucked Chad
last night

Nick and the rest of the crew stand in stunned
amazement

PALOMINO
See Nick I told you this was about
rejection

NICOLE
You fucking scumbag You think I
give a rats ass about you I was
there to get laid and even that was
a joke

PALOMINO
You know you are really starting to
piss me off

NICOLE
Oh does that mean youre not going
to come wiggle on the bed anymore
or stroke my hair real soft and
concerned or kiss me like a soap

Nick gets Palomino in a vicious headlock and starts
pounding

his head against the mattress

Cora still doesnt take her eyes off him and in fact
even more intently into his eye

Wolf glances away for a moment then looks back Cora
to stare at him Suddenly his eye is full of tears

silence

Finally Wanda approaches him hesitantly

WANDA
Nick

I can get right on the phone Well

here as soon as possible

NICK
No Hes absolutely right

Nick sighs heavily and sinks to sit on the dolly in
silence
Wolf appears behind him still wiping his eyes

WOLF
You want to just shoot Ellen Nick
She could be in the dream by herself

NICK
No Were not going to shoot anything
Im sorry Thanks for all your help
but its over I cant take it
anymore I tried to roll with it but
its time to face the music I cant
do this I am not a director The
shoot is over I give up

Nicks speech has the simple eloquence of truth he is

not
bitter or self-pitying He seems unaware of how
disturbing
this is to the crew They all stand around him in
shock
afraid to move or speak Finally Wolf turns to the AC
and
puts his hand on his shoulder like a father to his
young
son
WOLF
Take the camera off the dolly Start
putting it away
Everyone watches the AC unfasten the camera in silence
Nicole
stands alone on the set in her wedding dress still
holding
the golden apple Her face is frozen in dismay
Suddenly
CORA comes through the set door and marches up to
Nicole
CORA
Give me that apple
At the sound of his mothers voice Nick looks up He
sees
her snatch the apple from Nicoles hand and march back
out
the door closing it behind her
CORA

with the hand-held camera Wolf is now in his element
like Nureyev with the camera When he pans suddenly
Cora the whole crew ducks wildly and dives out of

Cora finally stops circling Nicole and stops abruptly
Suddenly she raises the apple right out in front of

Wolf glides forward with the camera framing an amazing
