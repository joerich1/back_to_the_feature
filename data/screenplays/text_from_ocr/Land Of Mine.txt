EXTINT JEEP - WEST COAST OF JUTLAND - AFTERNOON
May 1945 World War 2 is over

CU A Danish soldier Carl (military rank Sergeant) is
driving along in a jeep He turns into a gravel road
After a while he comes to the dunes overlooking the beach
Carl parks the jeep and steps out He walks over the
dunes On his back is a big backpack from which little
black flags are sticking out Carl stops on top of one

of the dunes and looks across the beach Clearly this is
a post-war landscape As far the eye can see the beach

is covered with lines of barbwire and signs saying
DANGER MINES

Carl pushes some sand off with his foot (He looks at a
mine map) A wooden plank (Pansermine) appears beneath the
sand Carl puts his backpack down and digs further up
ahead Another plank appears Carl puts his backpack
back on and walks along the planks down towards the sea
He treads carefully it is obvious that the entire beach
is littered with mines You can even see some of them
poke up through the sand

Carl goes all the way to the water before he stops He
looks down the beach He pulls a flag out of his backpack
and sticks it into the sand Then we walks along the
water

INT ARMY TRUCK - AFTERNOON

CU of young German soldier on the back of an army truck
This is Sebastian Besides Sebastian are 11 other German boys

We see their faces one by one Manfred Werner Ernst Helmut Ludvig Wilhelm and so on
12 boys in all They are just teenagers nevertheless
their youngish faces have a worn-out look to them Like
they have borrowed them from much older and more
experienced men Hard and weary The boys all look like
they have been starving some more than others They are
in various types of uniform All of which are worn and
torn

Two of the boys (Werner and Ernst) are like two peas in a
pod They are obviously twins Hidden from the view of
the others they are holding hands

Sebastian peers out through the a gap in tarpaulin cloth
that covers the back of the truck He squints as the
setting sun gets in his eyes The truck is driving along
a straight road through a forest near the Danish North
Sea coastline
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

Carl is driving his jeep along He drives past long lines
of German prisoners of war walking south along the road
heading back down towards Germany

Further ahead there is a scuffle between some Danes and
the German POVs Carl pulls up to them Honks the horn
He stops and gets out

Carl drags the Danes away The Germans are about to
continue walking Carl turns towards them

CARL (in German)
You stay here Understood

The Germans wait

Carl goes over and talks to the Danes (From afar) We
cant hear what they are saying The Danes point over at
the Germans

Carl turns around and goes over to the Germans He smiles
at them He stands there for a bit He offers one of
them a cigarette The German takes one and smiles back
Carl takes out a lighter

Long beat

Carl headbutts the German He goes down Carl looks at
the other Germans They make no move to interfere They
look scared

Nobody speaks

The German who was knocked down by Carl gets back up
They start walking

EXT ARMY BARRACKS SNDERBORG AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

The truck with Sebastian and the boys drives through a
gate It stops on a large open square We see several
trucks pull up next to it Pebbles crunch under the heavy
truck tires

German prisoners of war in all ages spill out from the
trucks and settle in the square A few Danish armed
soldiers are there to receive them

EXT ARMY BARRACKS SNDERBORG AREA - LATE AFTERNOON

About 70 German prisoners of war of various ages are lined
up outside of the square outside the main building Quite
a few of them are teenagers They look wretched in their
worn-out torn uniforms

A young Danish officer Ebbe (rank Lieutenant) comes
out of the main building Ebbe walks briskly and stops
in front of the Germans

Ebbe smiles and addresses the POWs in German

EBBE
My name is Lieutenant Ebbe Jensen
from the Danish Pioneer Corps
(Minenkommando
Danemark )

EBBE (CONTD)
To those of you who are still
unaware of what you are doing
here You have been brought here
to Denmark to clean up after the
war

EBBE (CONTD)
Denmark is neither your friend
nor your enemy Having said that
do not expect the Danes to welcome
you with open arms Nobody wants
you Germans here For us you
serve one purpose only To clear
the Danish west coast of German
land mines that you put there in
the first place

EBBE (CONTD)
I know that most of you have never
done any minesweeping or de-mining
That is why we have brought you
here before you are to de-mine
the beaches We will teach you
as much as we can in the little
time we have In other words We
are here to help

Beat

EBBE (in German) (CONTD)
Welcome to Denmark

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS BARRACKS - EVENING

Sebastian and the other boys walk in a line down a long
hallway They are shown into the sleeping quarters A
small room Filled with bunk beds without mattresses

Sebastian looks around It seems most of the beds are
occupied

Sebastian spots an empty bed next to the window He
sits down on the bed

One of the older boys Helmut comes over He looks
at Sebastian
He stands there for a long time before he speaks

HELMUT
Move Thats my bed

Sebastian looks at the boy Clearly this is not his
bed Sebastian thinks about standing his ground Decides
against it He gets up

SEBASTIAN
Of course

Sebastian finds a spot on the floor where he sits down
He looks around the room He pulls his blanket around
him

There is not enough beds for everyone and several others
have also had to settle for the floor

Sebastian lies down Looks around at the others before
he shuts his eyes

INT INTERIM CLASSROOM - MORNING

Sebastian and most of the boys he came with in the truck
are standing to attention in a small classroom The young
commanding officer Ebbe comes in He is flanked by two
Danish soldiers He stands in front of the boys Ona
table are several land mines

Ebbe looks around the room He pulls down a map of
Denmark

EBBE
Good morning

EVERYONE
Good morning lieutenant

Ebbe smiles Ebbe outlines the western coast of Denmark
on the map with his cane

EBBE
There are currently 22 million
land mines spread out along the
Danish west coast

He looks at the boys

EBBE (CONTD)
This is more than in all the other
European countries together
Someone must have thought that
the invasion from the west would
take place right here

Ebbe points again
EBBE (CONTD)
On the Danish coastline to the
North Sea What a shame for him
And what a shame for you lot too

Beat

EBBE (CONTD)
My only purpose here is to teach
you lot how to find and disarm
these mines Nothing else This
is what I do This is what I am
good at In other words I dont
need to know your names your
background I dont need to get
to know you You have each other
for that I am simply not
interested

Nobody says anything

EBBE (CONTD)
Understood

EVERYONE
Yes lieutenant

EBBE
How many have seen or handled a
land mine

Most of them raise a hand

EBBE (CONTD)
How many have disarmed one

Only a few hands

Ebbe walks over to the table He picks up a German teller
mine

EBBE (CONTD)
Who has seen one of these before

Most of them put their hands up

EBBE (CONTD)
Good They are also the most
common ones

The two soldiers pass the mine around for inspection

EBBE (CONTD)
For an optimal impact these mines
are buried 15 to 20 centimeters
below the sand This makes them
relatively easy to find

Ebbe picks up another type of mine
EBBE (CONTD)
Who knows what this is

Everyone puts their hand up

EBBE (CONTD)
Yes you

Ebbe picked Wilhelm the youngest of the boys

WILHELM
It is a Schrapnell mine
lieutenant

EBBE

Correct We call it Bouncing
Betty This kind of mine is always
placed in the heather or in the
dunes If the grass is not too
long they are visible - in most
cases

Ebbe puts two schrapnell mines on the table He strings
an almost invisible wire between them

EBBE (CONTD)
A thin metal wire is strung between
them If you trip it one or
more mines will launch a meter
into the air and

Ebbe gestures an explosion
EBBE (CONTD)
Ka-BOOM Out comes hundreds of
little iron pellets Not good

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS BARRACKS - NIGHT

Sebastian and the boys are in their beds Most have gone
to sleep Sebastian looks around Ernst (one of the
twin brothers) is having a nightmare Werner his
brother carefully wakes Ernst up He whispers to him
Holds him Ernst calms down Werner keeps watch over
his brother

Sebastian closes his eyes

EXT ARMY BARRACKS - DAY

Following day Sebastian and some of the other boys are
crawling around in a giant sand box Ebbe flanked by
two soldiers is walking among the boys Ebbe speaks
while observing the boys

EBBE
Faster everyone Each one of
you must disarm at least 6 mines
an hour
Cut to

A bit further away Carl is over by a barn He is loading

wooden planks onto a trailer Peter is helping him

While working Carl looks over at Ebbe
Peter looks at Carl

PETER

a Danish soldier

I thought you two were inseparable

Carl doesnt answer He keeps loading the trailer

Peter stops

PETER (CONTD)
In my opinion you should put it
behind you Carl The war has

ruined too God damn much already

right

CARL

Did anyone ask for youropinion

PETER

No but I am just saying that he

did everything he could to help
you from over there

Carl looks at Peter He goes over to him

Carl puts his

face right up against Peters This makes Peter nervous

Carl smiles at him

CARL
Did he And what do you know

about it little Peter How did

he help me exactly Or my dad

for that matter None of you did

shit You all sneaked out and
ran You call that help

Peter says nothing
CARL (CONTD)

3 years we were locked up Not
you Not him

Carl gently slaps Peter on the side of the head

CARL (CONTD)
And what did you do exactly
over there in Sweden Tell me

PETER
We were mobilizing Training
CARL
Mobilizing More like hiding
out and fucking all the Swedish
women and having a good time

CARL (CONTD)
And then you return all hero-like
After the danger is gone promoted
with pretty new ranks

Carl looks at Peters uniform

CARL (CONTD)
What are you now Senior Sergeant
How the fuck did that happen

Peter says nothing

CARL (CONTD)
Is there anything else you want
to say to me

Peter shakes his head

CARL (CONTD)
No I didnt think so So keep
your mouth shut

Cut to
Ebbe is walking in between the boys

EBBE
60 of the mines you will be de-
mining are made from non-metals
That is things like concrete
plastic glass or like this one
wood

EBBE (CONTD)
What do you think that means for
you guys

No one answers

EBBE (CONTD)
Nobody

EBBE (CONTD)
It means that the metal detectors
you see over there are absolutely
useless to you
(Ebbe points)

Ebbe holds up his little wooden stick
EBBE (CONTD)

This stick however can
(MORE )
EBBE (CONTD)
Unlike me the stick is now your
new best friend

Suddenly Ebbe whacks one of the boys Ludvig across
the hands with the stick

EBBE (CONTD)
Boom You just lost your hands

Ebbe is standing over him

EBBE (CONTD)
Keep going Go on There is no
time to feel sorry for oneself

Ludvig fiddles with the mine once more Ebbe whacks him
again

EBBE (CONTD)
Boom You are dead

EBBE (CONTD)
Again

Ludvig fiddles again His hands are red from the blows

EBBE (CONTD)
Boom I believe we have our first
terminal casualty here You dont
want to see your family again

EBBE (CONTD)
Are you really going to be the
first one to die

Ludvig mumbles

EBBE (CONTD)

LUDVIG

EBBE

LUDVIG

the first one to die

EBBE

EBBE (CONTD)

Sebastian and the other boys are taking note of what is
happening while they are prodding away in the sand
Manfred is digging next to Sebastian

MANFRED
Idiot

Ebbe hears it He comes over to Sebastian and Manfred

EBBE
Is there anything you want to
share with the group

Ebbe addresses Manfred

MANFRED
No sir

Ebbe looks over at Sebastian

SEBASTIAN
No sir I have nothing I want
to share with the group

EBBE
No really I saw you smile Do
tell Lord knows your friends
here could do with something to
smile about

SEBASTIAN
It was nothing
EBBE
Are you sure
SEBASTIAN
Yes sir lieutenant Absolutely

Most of the boys look down again and keep searching for
mines

EBBE
Show me what you got then

Sebastian prods with the stick carefully

Sebastian hits something He carefully digs with his
hands A teller mine (a practice mine) appears He
quickly disarms it He picks it up and puts it away
see that this is his fifth one

EBBE (CONTD)
What is your name

Sebastian doesnt answer

We

EBBE (CONTD)
What is your name soldier

SEBASTIAN
I didnt think the lieutenant was
interested in knowing our names
sir

Ebbe whacks Sebastians fingers with his cane Sebastian
pulls his hands back

EBBE
Good work Keep it up

Ebbe walks on

EBBE (CONTD)
Remember that your stick is your
best friend now Your own little
magic wand

Ebbe stops behind one of the others boys - Helmut (the
boy who took Sebastians bed) Ebbe whacks Helmuts hands

EBBE (CONTD)
Boom You are dead too

Helmut pulls his hands back

EBBE (CONTD)
Get moving Show me some magic

Ebbe stops and looks over at Carl who drives off ina
jeep

INT SLEEPING QUARTERS BARRACKS - NIGHT

Sebastian is sitting lying down with some of the other
boys in the sleeping quarters The boys are talking in
hushed voices Manfred is telling jokes

LUDVIG

MANFRED
No I dont want to

Ludvig laughs
WILHELM
Go on we want to hear it too I

MANFRED

MANFRED (CONTD)
So Hitler and G6éring are standing
on top of the Berlin radio tower
Hitler shakes his head and says
Berlin sure isnt what it used
to be eh G6ring shakes his
head

MANFRED (CONTD)
Hitler looks at G6ring and says
how he longs to put a smile back
on the lips of the Berliners
G6ring looks at Hitler and says
Then why dont you go ahead and
jump

The boys all burst out laughing All except Helmut
is stone-faced

Manfred smiles at Helmut

MANFRED (CONTD)
Come on man That is funny

Helmut looks at Manfred

HELMUT
Yeah What was the funny bit

The others laugh even harder

HELMUT (CONTD)
I dont see what is so funny

MANFRED
Well you know It would have
prevented the war

HELMUT
Yeah I get that And You think
that is funny

The others dont know whether to continue laughing or
Helmut looks angrily at Manfred
HELMUT (CONTD)
Why are you shaking your head
Because of me
Manfred doesnt answer
HELMUT (CONTD)
You think you are funny Or do

you think I am stupid

MANFRED
No

He

HELMUT

Manfred doesnt answer

HELMUT (CONTD)
You I am talking to you

MANFRED
No of course not I am just
goofing around man

HELMUT

He spreads out his arms to include their whole situation
Manfred doesnt answer

HELMUT (CONTD)
What about this Is that funny

Helmut gets up and grabs hold of Manfred
Sebastian steps between them
SEBASTIAN
Hey calm down He was just joking

Manfred nods
Helmut lets go of Manfred and turns to Sebastian
HELMUT
You want somthing You think you

Sebastian doesnt answer

HELMUT (CONTD)
Where did you serve

Again Sebastian doesnt answer

HELMUT (CONTD)
Do you know what I did

HELMUT (CONTD)
I was an officer

SEBASTIAN
So

There is high tension in the air

HELMUT
So I will tell you what You
would never have been able to do
what I did in the war You know
why Because you lack courage A
good leader and soldier should
have courage and never show fear

Sebastian doesnt answer

Helmut is right in front of Sebastian Right in his face

In a calm voice he says

HELMUT (CONTD)
You think I dont know your kind
Is that what you think You think
I dont recognize a stupid little
blue-collar boy when I see one

Helmut smiles

HELMUT (CONTD)
Oh yes A stupid little working-
class nobody That is what you
are right

Sebastian suddenly looks up at Helmut With a quick
movement Sebastian grabs Helmut by the throat with one

hand

He tightens his grip Helmut tries to get Sebastian
to let go

Sebastian stares straight into Helmuts eyes

SEBASTIAN
You I dont know you You ask
me all these questions and think
you are entitled to an answer
Why

Helmut can hardly breathe

Beat

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Why

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
You dont wanna know where I
was If I told you where I was
and what I did you would be
shitting your pants right now

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Are we clear

Helmut manages to nod even though he can barely breathe
Sebastian lets go of Helmut

Beat
Helmut is stunned He goes back to his bed

The others are quiet

EXT ARMY BARRACKS SANDBAG SILO - MORNING 11

Ebbe flanked by two soldiers is in a kind of silo made
from sandbags The boys are standing around them In
the middle on the ground lies a teller mine Spread out
with amble distance between them are several other teller
mines

EBBE
These mines are not dummy mines
I repeat they are not dummies

EBBE (CONTD)
This means that if you slip up
you will either get hurt very
badly or die Do I make myself
clear

EVERYONE
Yes sir

EBBE
Good Who volunteers to go first

Nobody answers

EBBE (CONTD)
Either someone will volunteer or
I will pick one There is no way
around it You are all going to
disarm a real mine today

Still no reply
EBBE (CONTD)
You didnt think that your first
live mine would be on the beach
did you

Helmut raises his hand Ebbe sees it but ignores him
and points to one young Wilhelm EBBE (CONTD)
You Yes you Come over here

Wilhelm stands to attention in front of Ebbe

EBBE (CONTD)
You will go first

WILHELM
Thank you sir

EBBE
When you have disarmed the mine
you leave through there You
bring the top of the mine out
with you as proof Understood

WILHELM
Yes lieutenant

EBBE
Good The rest of you come with
me

Ebbe the two soldiers and the rest of the boys leave the
silo

EBBE (Shouting) (CONTD)
Are you ready in there

WILHELM
Yes lieutenant

EBBE
Begin

Wilhelm begins His hands are trembling (CU) The mine
Wilhelm does it He wipes the sweat from his brow and
leaves the silo

He shows the lieutenant the fuse

EBBE (CONTD)
Good

Wilhelm puts it in the box that one of the soldiers is
holding

The boys are lined up

EBBE (CONTD)
Next

Helmut goes in
Ebbe shouts

EBBE (CONTD)
Ready

HELMUT
Ready lieutenant

EBBE
Begin

Helmut is quick He comes out and throws the fuse in the
box

EBBE (CONTD)
Well done and quick Good

Ebbe pats Helmut on the shoulder Helmut almost grows 3
feet from the praise

Ludvig tries to hide his nervousness His hands are
shaking out of control He clutches them behind his back
It is as if time is standing still for him He hardly
notices how the line is getting shorter and shorter that
it will be his turn very soon

Now only Sebastian Ludvig and Manfred remain
Sebastian goes in He comes out again almost immediately

Ebbe is surprised Helmut smiles His eyes say ‘finally
everyone sees that I am both quicker and more brave than
Sebastian’

Sebastian lifts up his arm opens his hand The top of
the mine - the fuse - is in his hand He puts it in the
box

SEBASTIAN
That would be one disarmed mine
Sir

Sebastian smiles So does everyone else Except Helmut
Sebastian winks at Ludvig when he walks past him

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Youve got this

With heavy steps Ludvig walks into the silo He stops
just inside the entrance Ludvig looks at the mine then
at all the disarmed ones He goes over to the mine
There are only two left Ludvig sits down and looks at
the two mines then he picks one up (CU) the mine His
hands are shaking

Outside Sebastian the boys the two private soldiers and
Ebbe are waiting

EBBE (shouting)
Come on The others would have
done the lot by now

Inside the silo Ludvig hears Ebbes cry faintly His
right hand slowly turns the fuse

Outside Ebbe looks at his watch

EBBE (CONTD)
Are you asleep in there

No answer

SEBASTIAN
Permission to go in and get him
sir

EBBE

Not a chance

EBBE (CONTD)
God damn it

Ebbe goes over to the silo

EBBE (CONTD)
I am coming in

Ebbe enters the silo

When Ebbe comes into the silo Ludvig is sitting in the
middle cross-legged looking at the mine

Ludvig slowly looks up at Ebbe

LUDVIG
I can do this

EBBE
Get up

LUDVIG

No I can do this
EBBE
Put that mine down right now
soldier That is an order
LUDVIG
No I can do this I want to do
it
Ebbe looks at Ludvigs shaking hands
The boys outside cover their ears

Ebbe comes out

Ludvig turns the last of bit of the top Nothing happens
He carefully disconnects the copper wires He did it

Ludvig gets up He proudly exits the silo He drops the
top in the box The others applaud Even Ebbe is smiling

The only one who hasnt been in yet is Manfred He
looks at the boys

Ebbe sends in Manfred

The others are still thrilled that Ludvig made it
Suddenly there is a huge explosion

Black smoke pour out of the silo

Fade to black

The boys march along a gravel road with barb-wire on either
side

CUT TO
The boys and Sebastian reach an old tarred wooden fishing
hut inside the fenced off area The hut is right in the
middle of the dunes It is a beautiful setting

If it hadnt for all the barbwire and the fencing it would
have been scenic

Not far from the fishing hut is a little run-down two-
winged farmhouse We see that a girl is playing just
outside the farmhouse

EXT FISHING HUT - DAY

A military jeep with a trailer pulls up in front of the
fishing hut The boys who were sitting down get up and
stand to attention Carl is driving the jeep He stops
the jeep in front of the hut He looks casually at the
boys before he jumps out and walks over to the farmhouse

Carl knocks on the door to the farmhouse

a barn They stop in front of a traditional wooden door
Karin unlocks it

perplexed Carl notices

CARL (CONTD)

water

Carl washes his neck and hands from the tap on the outside
of the farmhouse He fills up his canteen

comes over and sits next to him He strokes it

The sun is high in the sky and it is hot
Carl is carrying a gun and wearing an English army uniform
with a red arm band with yellow text saying Dansk

A little later Carl is walking through the dunes The
boys walk after him in single file

They reach the top of the dunes Carl stops He looks
out across the sea and down to the beach Despite the
bunkers and all the barbwire spread out along the beach
it is a stunning sight for Carl and the boys Waves crash
onto the beach

Carl walks down the dunes and onto the beach itself The
boys follow Single file He climbs onto a bunker 6
meters up

EXT BUNKER - DAY

Carl is standing on top of the bunker looking down

CARL
Come up here

The boys climb up

Carl is balanced on the very edge of the bunker He leans
into the wind The wind is strong enough to hold him at
an angle without him falling over

Carl looks back at the boys He smiles

CARL (CONTD)
Can you see the black flag down
there

Carl points to the north along the beach The boys look
for the flag They see it It is a long way away At

Down the beach is another flag

CARL
In the area between those flags
and the road are 22000 mines

CARL (CONTD)
You will disarm all of them You
do this and you get to go home
Do you understand Then you can
go home But not a second before
(MORE )

CARL (CONTD

)

With six mines an hour and
provided you dont blow yourselves
up it will take you three months

EVERYONE
Yes sir

The boys grimace despairingly

Carl turns and look at Sebastian
skeptically Carl goes over to him

Sebastian looks at him

CARL

Do you want to say something
SEBASTIAN

No sir
CARL

Are you sure

SEBASTIAN
Absolutely sure sir

Carl looks at the boys He stands there for a while

CARL

Do I need to point out what happens
to anyone who tries to escape

EVERYONE
No sir

Cut to

The boys are ready with long sticks

and long yarns of

string Carl is crouching on the sand He scoops away
some sand to reveal a wooden beam just below the sand

CARL
Can everyone see these
EVERYONE
Yes sir
CARL

These rafters run from the dunes
down towards the sea approximately
every 150 meters You can step
safely up to 1 meter on either
side of such a rafter Some are
almost impossible to see some
have rotted away You must find
every single one of these rafters
in the area before we begin It
is absolutely essential that we
clear the beach systematically in
a precise grid
CARL (CONTD)
You start by clearing out a safe
path here We need a passage
from here and all the way up to
the dunes Is that understood

EVERYONE
Yes sir

Beat

CARL

You Yes you with the map

Carl looks at Ludvig

LUDVIG
Ludvig sir

CARL
Come here

Ludvig quickly goes over and stands to attention in front

of Carl

CARL (CONTD)

Did they teach you to
in your training

LUDVIG
Yes sir

CARL

read maps

What is the name of the area we

are standing in right

now

Ludvig looks down at the map Not sure

CARL (CONTD)

Guess

LUDVIG
Area number 3 Sir

Carl smiles
CARL
Try again This time
correct answer

Ludvig is sweating nervously

Sebastian next to Ludvig points
map Carl sees this but makes

LUDVIG
Area number 7 sir

give me the

to area number 7 on the
no comment
CARL
Correct And how many mines are
buried within this area according
to the map

Ludvig looks at the map He is not sure He looks to
Sebastian for help

CARL (CONTD)
We want an answer today Ludvig

Ludvig spots a number next to area 7 but he is still not

sure

LUDVIG
1200 mines sir

Carl smiles

CARL
Correct This area is to be your
main throughway your safe zone
to and from the beach From here
we work our way into the other
areas We always use this passage
when going up to the house or
carrying disarmed mines up to the
pickup point by the road No
shortcuts through other areas
Is this clear to everyone

EVERYONE
Yes sergeant

CARL
There are mine maps for almost
all the areas

The boys are standing around him as Carl points to the

map

CARL (CONTD)
The area is defined by a number -
the dots or stars tell us what
type of mine we are dealing with
The number is always in the left
corner

CARL (CONTD)
Those of you who will be in charge
of the count must make sure that
these mine maps are always up-to-
date This task is as important
as the de-mining itself Dont
you ever forget that This map
is the only thing that proves
that a given area has been cleared
of mines Do you understand
EVERYONE
Yes sir

Helmut walks a few steps into the sand to get a better

look

Carl sees it He lets him stand like that for a moment

CARL
Stop

Helmut stops and turns

CARL (CONTD)
What is your name soldier

HELMUT
Helmut sir

CARL
Helmut

HELMUT
Yes sir

CARL

Helmut are you stupid

HELMUT
No sir

CARL
Well do you have a death wish

HELMUT
No sir

Carl looks really irritated at Helmut

CARL
How many meters from the raft did
I say

HELMUT

One meter sir

Helmut looks down He realizes that he has walked
meters onto the beach

Helmut freezes Carl turns around and walks away
a safe distance he shouts

CARL
The rest of you come with me

The boys look at Helmut and then follow Carl

Otto Carls dog stays and looks at Helmut

3-4

From

HELMUT
Here boy come here boy

Carl whistles Otto turns around and runs to Carl and
the other boys

Helmut just stands there for a while Then he nervously
walks back towards safety

Cut to
Carl with the boys up by the road

CARL
You

Carl points to Sebastian

CARL (CONTD)
Repeat

SEBASTIAN
This is where we deposit the
disarmed mines that we do not
detonate ourselves The teller
mines are to be lined up in
straight lines of 25 each With
the front of the mine pointing
forward

CARL
And

SEBASTIAN
Always remember the mine count
and take down the precise number
Every time
Carl stands a while Then smiles

CARL
Good

Helmut smiles sarcastically

HELMUT

Why He might as well understand
that his bright future is a fairy
tale fantasy

WILHELM
It is no fantasy It is reality
He already promised me

HELMUT
And what if

Sebastian stops Helmut

SEBASTIAN
Stop it

Wilhelm doesnt really understand what is going on

Helmut stays quiet He shakes his head
WILHELM
(to Sebastian)

The boys have been ordered to begin de-mining They are
crawling along spread out evenly along the beach ina
long line

Carl is observing from a safe distance The dog is by
his side

The area they are in has already been precisely measured
out into smaller squares

Sebastian is inching himself along carefully prodding

Panorama of the entire beach
This task seems endless

Foam from the salty waves tumbles playfully across the
beach in the wind The sight is strangely mesmerizing
even beautiful

EXT GRAVEL ROAD WEST COAST - DAY 30

Later The sun is shining It is very hot Ludvig
Werner and Ernst are dragging a trolley full of disarmed
mines along the gravel road They can see Carl and his
dog further down the road The trolley is heavy with its
load of disarmed mines

LUDVIG
First two things when I get back

Carl walks after them The dog is by Carls side at all
times

EXT BEACH - AFTERNOON

Later Sebastian is disarming yet another mine He is
sweating profusely now and his hands are shaking He
almost messes it up But he makes it

Behind Sebastian are 9 disarmed mines already He
carefully places the 10th one with the others

Helmut seems annoyed that Sebastians speed The others
are nowhere near as fast as Sebastian

They are all belly down on the sand Several have taken
off their uniforms in the intense heat

Wilhelm the youngest of the boys are on top of the dunes
He throws a handful of sand down onto the boy below in
the sand The sand startles the boy When he looks up
Wilhelm ducks down out of sight

William does it a few times The boy finally gets up and
looks around Still nothing to see

BOY
Stop it It is not funny

No reply Wilhelm is still ducked down out of sight He
is clasping his mouth in tears laughing

BOY (CONTD)
I know that somebody is there

Wilhelm makes no reply The boy gives up and goes back
to work

A little while later Wilhelm is about to do it again
This time Carl is standing right behind him Carl pushes
Wilhelm with his leg so he falls to the sand He steps
on Wilhelms hand pushes it down into the sand Wilhelm
is in pain Carl looks at Wilhelms pile or disarmed
mines only two

CARL
You wanna stay here forever

WILHELM
No sir

Carl yells in Wilhelms face

CARL
Then stop playing and get to work

WILHELM
Yes Sergent

Further down the beach we see several more German POV de-
mining platoons they look like lines of tiny ants crawling
on the beach

Suddenly we hear a thud from far away A cloud of smoke
appears on the horizon Cold fear runs through the veins
of the boys A reminder of what happens if they are not
careful

The boys get up They look at the cloud of smoke Then
they keep going Nobody says anything They know that
it could just as well have been one of them

CARL
Six mines an hour Get on with
it

The boys lie down on the sand and get back to work

EXTINT FISHING HUT - EVENING

Later Outside the fishing hut Some of the boys are

sitting outside Wilhelm is sitting on an old fence trying

to use a leaf of grass to whistle

Two other boys have a little throwing game going where
they take turns throwing stones into a boot

The doors and windows to the hut are open Sebastian is
lying down inside looking out the window He can see
the others outside Sebastian is building a wooden frame
The little girl (Elizabeth) from the farmhouse is walking
around just outside the barbwire surrounding the area of
the fishing hut Sebastian smiles when he sees her

She is dressed in a home made dress - vaguely resembling
a princess gown She is pushing an old-fashioned pale
blue baby stroller with a doll in it

She walks up to the fence She looks at the boys sitting
outside Initially the boys ignore her

The twins Werner and Ernst are sitting next to each other
Werner smiles at the girl

Helmut is sitting close by He looks at the twins

The girl walks back and forth a couple of times She
picks up her doll from the cart and shows it the boys

The doll is very worn and almost all its hair has fallen
out She strokes the dolls bald head

She holds up the doll so the boys can get a good look

The girl moves the arm of the doll so it looks like it is
waving

Werner waves back and smiles

Suddenly the girl picks up a piece of bread and takes a
bite from it She puts the bread back in the dolls pram

Werner one of the twins sees this and goes to the fence

Werner crouches down and smiles to the girl

WERNER (in German)
What is her name

The girl looks at Werner perplexed

WERNER (CONTD)
Do you understand German

The girl smiles

GIRL (in Danish)
Today is her birthday She turns
five

Werner knows that she doesnt understand him But then
again he also has no clue what she is saying either

Sebastian can see and hear everything that is going on
outside

WERNER (in German)
Well she is really cute

GIRL
You can all attend her birthday
party if you want There will
be layered cake and hot chocolate

Werner reaches through the fence and strokes the dolls
head His other hand is reaching for the bread

GIRL (CONTD)
She has a boo-boo Look

The girl points to a band-aid on the dolls leg

Werner pulls his hand back and covers his mouth The
girl smiles

GIRL (CONTD)
Ow

WERNER (tysk)
Ill say Ow indeed

Werner takes out a tiny strip of gauze from his pocket
and reaches for the doll Through the barbwire

WERNER (CONTD)
May I

The girl hands him the doll Werner carefully wraps the
dolls leg

WERNER (CONTD)
There you go As good as new

The girl touches the gauze and smiles

GIRL
Thank you

WERNER (in German)
You are welcome

Suddenly Karin the girls mother is standing behind the
barbwire to the farmhouse

KARIN
Elizabeth Elizabeth Get over
here right away

Karin runs over and grabs the girl by the hand Pulls
her away Away from them

KARIN (CONTD)
Come on

The girl is resisting She doesnt want to follow

KARIN (CONTD)
What is wrong with you Come
here

Karin pulls the girl along The girl reluctantly lets
herself be pulled away

On the way back the little girl turns around and waves
Werner waves back He smiles at both of them The mother
ignores him

Werner straightens up and goes back and sit down Helmut
gets up and stands directly in front of Werner

HELMUT
We were told No contact with
Danish civilians

Werner ignores Helmut

HELMUT (CONTD)
Are you deaf

Sebastian looks out at them through the open door Werner
gets up and stands in front of Helmut He puts his face
an inch in front of Helmuts face

WERNER
Did you want something Mr
officer

Helmut stands there a moment Werner shows no fear Helmut
turns around and goes into the fishing hut From behind
his uniform Werner takes out the bread he took from the
girl He tears it in half and gives Ernst half

WERNER (CONTD)
Eat brother

INT FISHING HUT - CONTINUOUS 33

Helmut sits down on his bed Unties his boots and takes
them off

He looks at Sebastian who is still sitting on his bed
Helmut lies down He clutches his stomach He is hungry

SEBASTIAN

HELMUT (CONTD)

he comes from

EXT FISHING HUT - EVENING 34

there just to rub it in

SEBASTIAN

LUDVIG

EXT FISHING HUT - EVENING 37

The boys are sitting outside looking across to the farm
There is a light behind the windows Carls door is open

HELMUT

None of the boys say anything Sebastian looks at Helmut

HELMUT (CONTD)
Those who want Sebastian to do it
raise your hands

Only a couple of boys raise their hands

HELMUT (CONTD)
What is with you guys Are you
not hungry

(to Sebastian)

And you why dont you do
something You think we dont

SEBASTIAN
He has no food Dont you get
it And if he had food he would
never give it to us He doesnt
care about us They all hate us

Helmut is shocked by hearing the truth Despondent he
sits down

Sebastian smiles back
SEBASTIAN

That is good Wilhelm that is

The other boys on the beach are frozen in their positions -

in their own areas

Sebastian is calmly holding Wilhelm Evidently this is
not the first time he has dealt with death and mayhem

Sebastian looks up at Helmut Ernst and Werner He yells

SEBASTIAN
Help me

They do not react

Sebastian starts to put pressure on the wounds to slow
down the bleeding by wrapping his belt around what is
left of Wilhelms arms Sebastian looks at Helmut who is
standing a short distance away

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Helmut I need your help We
need to get him off this beach

Helmut is still horrified He doesnt react

Sebastian starts lifting and dragging Wilhelm across the
sand He is looking for someone to come and help him

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
For christs sake help me Helmut

Helmut is just standing there catatonic Werner now
comes running over to help

WERNER

curiously She quickly shuts the door once she realizes
what has happened
Sebastian runs over to the jeep and finds a first aid
kit He opens it It is half empty He empties the
contents of the bag on the ground Other than a bit of
gauze there really isnt anything of use

CARL
What is in that one

Karin looks into the sack

he built earlier He has attached 4 strings to it so
they make 9 squares

Sebastian puts the frame on the ground He puts a stick
in each square

Carl is impressed although he doesnt show it This will
no doubt lessen the risk and make the de-mining work
easier

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
I know how much the sergeant hate
us And that the sergeant dont
care where we die of starvation
or get blown up by a mine But I
believe that it will look much
better for you if we die on the

Ebbe smiles

EBBE
Right

Another officer steps into the circle and starts peeing
on Ludvigs face The officer is laughing

Carl is looking on Sebastian and the other boys are
standing just near by

One of the officers takes out his hand gun He aims it
at the boys He changes his aim from boy to boy

A third officer steps forward to piss on Ludvig He pulls
out his dick but nothing comes out He cant piss The
others laugh

BRITISH SOLDIER
Shit in his mouth instead

The others laugh

The officer laughs and pulls his pants down and turns
around He sits places his ass over Ludvigs face

OFFICER GARTH
Open your mouth Nazi boy

Ludvig is crying

Carl looks around at this madness Something inside a
transformation takes place He is repulsed by these Danish
and British officers

The officer with the gun goes over and points it at Ludvig

OFFICER GIVENS
Do as your fucking told Nazi
boy Open your goddamn mouth

Ludvig opens his mouth

The others are laughing loudly Sebastian jumps in and
protects Ludvig

few of them and drops them on the ground

Ebbe and Carl are standing next to each other

CARL
This is not cool Ebbe I had
just managed to get a real good
pace going on the beach

EBBE
What is this I hear about you
picking up food for the Germans

CARL
Yeah Where did you hear that

EBBE
Is it true though

CARL
I picked up some food for myself
I have a healthy appetite And
a few bits for my dog

EBBE
If I were you I wouldnt even
think about doing that again It
upsets people you know They
get uptight

CARL
You mean it upsets you

EBBE
Maybe I just find it very peculiar
that you need to go and get food
when we are paying the old farmer
here very generously for your
board and lodging

Ebbe doesnt answer
EBBE (CONTD)
Do you hear what I am saying

Carl

CARL
Yeah yeah I hear you Ebbe

EBBE
Hey look at me when I am talking
to you

Carl turns to Ebbe

CARL
I hear you And now I see you
too Do you hear me

CARL (CONTD)
You forgot to tell me that I would
be given a bunch of German kids
That pretty much changes the whole
damn situation dont you think

EBBE
Does it I dont see why If
they were old enough to go to
war they are old enough to clean
up after it

CARL
I want you to help me get some
older and more experienced men
for my unit

Beat
EBBE
Do you know what they call it
when a child steals

Carl smiles

EBBE (CONTD)
Oh you know this one

CARL
You are not answering my request

EBBE
Yes I am Just listen carefully

Ebbe smiles

EBBE (CONTD)
If a child steals it is called a
‘mania’ Right If grown-ups
steal it is klepto-mania You
with me so far

Ebbe smiles
EBBE (CONTD)
But what is it called when a
country steals

Ebbe provides the answer

EBBE (CONTD)
Ger-mania

He bellows with laughter at his own joke Carl is stone

faced

CARL
None of these boys have a clue
about what they are doing

Ebbe smiles

EBBE
Well you will just have to teach
them then wont you After all
that is why you are here

Ebbe smiles and looks at Carl

EBBE (CONTD)
They are Germans Carl Young
old all Germans Relax
Enjoy life for christs sake
It is just a bit of payback right
If we lose a couple here and there
so be it It is part of the job

Ebbe smiles to Carl

EBBE (CONTD)
You havent started caring about
the enemy have you

CARL
Fuck no I mean they dont mean
shit to me

EBBE

Good Better them than us right

his own brother He is stunned Then he jumps up and
runs desperately over to Werners area

spread all over the place Ernst staggers about inside
the mine field confused shocked looking for pieces of
his twin brother

He screams Ludvig and Sebastian come over They

Private Ludvig Hafke You were
responsible for area number 7

LUDVIG
That is correct Sergeant And
everything was accounted for

But everything wasnt accounted

LUDVIG
No sergeant sir I counted
them several times to be sure
Sergeant 1200 mines buried

him down

HELMUT
We could do a re-count sergeant
See if the numbers add up

Carl looks at Helmut He yells

CARL

good are the numbers now Tell
me Can you say for sure that
that area is secured

HELMUT
No sergeant

CARL
A mine field is secure when we
have found and disarmed the same
amount of mines as indicated by
the map Correct

Not correct A mined area is

secure when all the mines have
been removed What happened
yesterday clearly indicates that
you have not done your job well
enough

EVERYONE
Yes sir

CARL
Do I need to remind you that a
civilian could have stepped on
that mine

EVERYONE
No sir

CARL
From now on every time you have
cleared an area you will walk
through that area arm in arm
side by side and make sure that
no mistakes have been made My
mistake was to place my trust in
you

CARL (CONTD)
Are we clear

The boys look at each other They are terrified

Were you saying something soldier

HELMUT
No Sergent

Carl looks at the boys with and ice-cold stare

CARL
Forward march

The young boys walk in a daisy-chain across the entire de-
mined area Fully aware that every step might literally
be their last

every inch of this beach until we
are sure

Sebastian looks over towards Carl

Carl turns his back to them and walks off The two guards
stay

EXT BUNKER THE BEACH - EVENING

Later Carl is sitting on a bunker He looks down at
the beach and the boys down there

The boys are still marching arm in arm
The two armed guards follow at a safe distance
They have a lot more ground to cover

One of the guards are talking to the boys We see this
from Carls point of view The guard comes up to Carl

GUARD

can have a break And some food

CARL
They can have some food when they
are done

They hear Carl put the board across the door and lock up

The boys sit a while Helmut looks around at all of them

HELMUT
I say we get the fuck out of here
now Before we all die

Nobody says anything

HELMUT (CONTD)
Hallo You accept this
Personally I would rather be shot
by the Brits than walk on that
beach one more time

Sebastian looks at him

SEBASTIAN
We stay until its done Then we
go home That is the best option
We finish our job The sergeant
promised that we get to go home
when we are done

HELMUT

to us when he sees that you are
gone I cannot allow it

HELMUT
It is not up to you I am
leaving

HELMUT (CONTD)
You dont get it do you You
think he is your friend He
detests you all of us You
know the other de-mining units

beaches But us We have to

the sergeant is our friend

Sebastian looks at the other boys

SEBASTIAN
Get hold of him Tie him down

The other boys look at Sebastian

on The little girl Elizabeth has walked out into one
of the mine fields that has not yet been de-mined

The girl is standing still Frozen She is holding her
doll

EXT THE BEACH - MORNING

When Carl gets to the dunes he sees the boys

By the time Carl gets down there he knows what is going
on

Sebastian and Helmut have already started clearing a
passage to the girl

They are going as fast as they can Struggling Sebastian
turns around

SEBASTIAN
It is going to take a while

Suddenly the girl starts moving Everyone starts yelling

EVERYONE
Sit down

KARIN
You have to sit down my little
darling

The girl doesnt hear them She smiles and waves

Ernst suddenly appears behind the crowd Nobody notices
him

Suddenly he walks through the crowd Past Carl Past
the other boys He steps over the barbwire and into the
fenced-off area

Ernst walks into the mine field Going in a straight
line He walks past Sebastian who is disarming a mine
He heads straight towards the girl

Everyone drops to the ground
Sebastian stops working and looks up at Ernst astounded

But no mines go off and Ernst reaches the girl He sits
down and smiles to her

ERNST (in German)
Shall I take a look at her

The girls smiles she thinks he is Werner to whom she
spoke earlier

GIRL
You talk funny

ERNST (pointing to the doll)
Boo-boo

The girl smiles and hands Ernst the doll Ernst looks at
the bandage around the dolls leg It is dirty Ernst
unwraps it And gets out a new piece of gauze from his
pocket

He is going to wrap the dolls left leg The girl shakes
her head Ernst understands It is no longer the leg
which is injured

Ernst tries various places Right leg Right arm Left
arm In the end Ernst and the girl agree that the doll
needs her head bandaged They help each other wrap the
dolls head

The girl smiles Ernst has tears in his eyes

Meanwhile Sebastian has cleared a narrow path through the
mine field out to the girl and Ernst

SEBASTIAN
Ernst Hand her to me

Ernst lifts the girl up and passes her over to Sebastian

Sebastian carries her back

Karin takes her

Slowly everyone gets up Ernst is still out there He
looks at everyone and the mother who is crying and
frantically hugging the girl

Sebastian looks out towards Ernst

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Are you coming Ernst

Ernst looks at Sebastian for a long time He smiles at
him Sebastian returns the smile

SEBASTIAN (CONTD)
Come her Ernst Please

All of a sudden Ernst turns and walks on further into
the minefield Ernst keeps walking And walking

The others are shouting for him to stop Sebastian is
about to run after him Suddenly we hear a loud click

Ernst looks down at his right leg A shiver runs through
his body He looks around Looks back at the others

At Sebastian Somehow Ernst looks at ease almost
relieved

Explosion Ernst is blown to bits He is gone

All thats left is a cloud of black smoke slowly
dispersing in the wind

Silence falls on the beach We see the faces of the crowd

Carl Sebastian the girl Karin and all the boys They
are quiet The joy has been replaced by an eerie
emptiness

CU Sebastian

EXT FISHING HUT - LATER

Carl comes walking from the farm He goes over to the
fishing hut Helmut and Ludvig are sitting outside

CARL
Where is Sebastian

Ludvig points behind the fishing hut Carl goes around
to Sebastian

Carl stops He looks at Sebastian who is sitting
motionlessly staring vacantly into the air Carl goes
over to him He holds out his hand to Sebastian
Sebastian ignores Carl completely Carl leaves his hand
in front of Sebastian for a long while In the end
Sebastian slaps the hand away Carl tries again

Sebastian gets up He looks angry For the first time
Sebastian can no longer hold back his feelings He pushes
Carl Carl doesnt budge Sebastian pushes him again
Carl lets him He is a lot bigger than Sebastian
Sebastian is furious Carl stands right in front of him

the face Carl doesnt budge

CARL
Lieutenant

Ebbe is standing in front of the open window

EBBE (CONTD)
Can you smell it The smell of
Denmark of spring and summer
It is going to be a great year
Dont you think

Carl smiles

CARL
Yeah a great year

EBBE
You are probably wondering why
you have been summoned

CARL
You can say that again

EBBE
The reason that I am here is
that we are going to need more
experienced men at Skallingen

CARL
Yeah Okay I can do that But
I thought you wanted me in

Ringsted

EBBE
Oh I do I wasnt talking about
you

Carl doesnt understand

CARL
Okay So what are you saying

EBBE
We really need to reassign your
German boys down there The
whole place is one big mess All
the mines have shifted and they
need some skillful Germans with
experience The men are dying by
the handfuls down there

CARL
Yeah Well I wish I could help
you But my unfortunately my
boys have already left They
have been shipped back to Germany
just this morning

EBBE
Yeah I heard

CARL
Out of 14 4 made it

Clearly Ebbe couldnt care less
EBBE
Your German boys are not on

their way home Carl

Carl doesnt understand

CARL
Excuse me
EBBE
Like I said we really need their

experience
(MORE )
Ebbe looks

EBBE (CONTD)
And that is why they have been
reassigned to Skallingen Which
is where they will remain until
all the mines down there have
been cleared

CARL
With all due respect you promised
me that they would be allowed to
return home after clearing that
area I made them a promise God
damn it How does that make me
look

at Carl

EBBE
There is nothing we can do about
it

CARL
What are you talking about When
was this decided I was
specifically told that these boys
could return home after their job
was done

EBBE
Carl This isnt just your boys
All German soldiers still in the
country are retained until all
the mines are gone And I mean
all

Carl stands there a few moments

CARL
God damn it Ebbe I am asking
you as your friend You and I
have been friends for how long
I am begging you just let those
four boys return home Let them
go They will die down there

EBBE
Of course you want them to go
home I totally understand But
unfortunately the order has
already been carried out

CARL
It is only four boys God damn
it

EBBE
Now listen to me Carl
(MORE )

Carl says

Carl goes
breathe

EBBE (CONTD)
I dont know what the fuck is
going on with you but if I hear
one more word about those boys I
will personally go down to
Skallingen and shoot them myself
You hear me

nothing

EBBE (CONTD)
You think these are nice boys
They are not They have been

brainwashed by monsters from early

on You have no idea what they
have done in the war

over and grabs hold of Ebbes neck
Carl really squeezes hard

straight in the eyes

CARL
You lied to me I can tell just
by looking at you You knew this
all along These boys are just

little boys Ebbe They cry out
for Mommy when they are afraid
or when their hands get blown
off You understand The tables
have turned We are the monsters

Carl lets go of Ebbe

Carl turns around and leaves

He picks it up

An older Danish sergeant is standing in front of them
All the other soldiers in the unit are older than
Sebastian Helmut Ludvig and the forth boy

SERGEANT
Welcome to the Oksbgl Camp and
Skallingen We have reason to
believe that roughly 72000 mines
have been laid down here on
Skallingen So this place is not
for sissies

He grins

SERGEANT (CONTD)
The reason I use the terms ‘reason
to believe and ‘roughly’ is that
some of you have had the luxury
of having detailed mine maps at
your disposal At Skallingen we
have no such maps

The boys faces have the look of betrayal written all
over them

Zoom in on and CU of Sebastian We stay with him for a
long time

The sound fades down completely We hear only Sebastians
breathing

Sebastians POV A soldier comes over to the sergeant
He passes him a note The sergeant looks irritated

Cut to
Sebastian wakes up when he is slapped in the face
SERGENT
Sebastian Schumann Do you
hear me Report to the mess hall
on the double

out of the ranks
