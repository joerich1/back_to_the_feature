NEW YORK CITY 1991
INT NEW YORK CITY PRE-WAR APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mostly darkness in the small apartment a few table lamps
illuminating a comfortable crowded well worn space On one
shelf souvenirs from a past life a framed NY Times Best
Seller list from 1980 with Kilgallen by Lee Israel
highlighted in the number 15 spot Five or six copies of this
book and a similar number of Miss Tallulah Bankhead (also by
Lee) and many more of Estee Lauder by Lee Israel line a
shelf It’s a bit of a trophy case

Across the room a well worn cat tree sits in the corner
piles of New Yorkers and LEE ISREAL around 50 and not
trying very hard is asleep in her clothes on the couch A
Blossom Dearie record spins on the record player a cat
snoozes in her lap Both snore An alarm beeps on Lee’s casio
digital watch Finally she rouses She looks down at her
watch which reads 10pm and stops the alarm

She moves to the kitchen responding slightly to the music

We imagine she may be getting ready for bed She puts her a

plate in the sink and returns She downs her water from the
table and puts the glass into her purse She takes a bottle

of scotch and also puts it into her purse She turns off the
light but then the front door opens hall-light pouring in
and we see Lee exit The door slams shut

INT HIGH-RISE OFFICE BUILDING - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
Nondescript cubicles and the nondescript people who are
working in them It is the graveyard shift and the YOUNG
EMPLOYEES are proofreading and black-lining law documents

The large room is eerily silent save for the scratching of
pencils on paper and the sound of ICE CLINKING in a glass

Lee is working as well drinking a scotch on the rocks She
swirls it around absentmindedly as she works without
enthusiasm
TWO YOUNG WOMEN pass by her cubicle
YOUNG WOMAN
(whispering)

Fucking kill me if I’m doing this at her

age
Lee hears and waits til she can’t see them

LEE
Ill kill you now if you ask nicely

Embarrassed giggles Swirling her glass of scotch Lee works
Someone shouts from another cubicle head barely visible

CUBICLE WORKER
You know we’re not allowed to eat or
drink in here

ANOTHER CUBICLE WORKER
(after a beat)
Yeah

Lee ignores them The first cubical worker tries to peer over
to Lee

CUBICLE WORKER

Hello

LEE
Fascist

A THIRD WORKER (0S)
Alcoholic

Some laughter Lee goes back to her work tries to
concentrate She can’t

LEE
(beat)
Why do you give a crap

CUBICLE WORKER
Because the sound of the ice is driving
me insane

MANY VOICES
Me too It’s making me crazy

LEE
Oh fuck off

She drinks making as much ice noise as possible

TALL MAN
What did you say

LEE
I believe I said fuck off

A tall MAN 30 appears at her cubicle

TALL MAN
I’m your boss Pack up

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 3

LEE
I’m almost through with this document

TALL MAN
Now

He takes the document and other papers from her desk and
gestures for her to get up

LEE
(quietly)
Please I need this job

He ignores her watching as she puts her things into her
canvas bag (including her glass and bottle of scotch) He
walks behind her ushering her out

The young people in the cubicles watch with amusement as she
goes Breaking into loose applause

INT CORNER MARKET - VERY EARLY MORNING

Straight from the job Lee puts her groceries up on the
counter - cereal peanut butter a can of cat food On the
small black and white TV a program with garishly wealthy
characters is playing The CASHIER 60s Asian woman is
skeptical

CASHIER
(she knows her)
How much have you got

LEE
(fishing in her pocket)
Enough
CASHIER

Show me first
Lee counts out her disappointing amount of cash

LEE
Okay just this

She separates the cereal and cat food and pays for them

CASHIER
Put this other stuff back

Lee walks out

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 4

INT LEE’S UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT - MORNING 4

Lee opens the cat food and places it in front of her cat
JERSEY who’s not interested

LEE
Since when did you become picky

She puts the cereal on the counter and walks through her
cluttered apartment Peeling paint way too much stuff and
years of stacked up New Yorker magazines The small one
bedroom apartment hasn’t been updated in at least 20 years
paint is chipping furniture is worn and scratched by
multiple cats even the light bulbs need dusting But you can
tell it was once a well-loved little box of a home

The dining table is covered with papers and coffee cups and
empty wine bottles leaving little room for the manual
typewriter and old computer

INT LEE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 5

A few dead flies lie on her pillow Disgusted she brushes
them off and curls up to sleep in her clothes

INT LEE’S BATHROOM - EARLY EVENING 6
Broken shower tiles an old moldy curtain In the medicine
cabinet mirror Lee smooths down her hair and applies

lipstick

She notices the litter box in the corner is in unused
pristine condition

She notices a COAT GUY taking jackets but she walks past him
in search of the bar

Her host MARJORIE 70 years old and sophisticated sees her

MARJORIE
Well this is a surprise

LEE
You invited me did you not

MARJORIE
You didn’t reply

LEE
(ignoring that)
A coat check At my party we threw coats
on a bed

MARJORIE
Nice to see you too Lee
LEE
(beat)
You never call me back I’ve got some new
ideas
MARJORIE
This is why you’re here
LEE
You don’t know what I’ve been doing just
to get by
MARJORIE

Well you’re here now Try to enjoy
yourself Lee

Marjorie excuses herself

ANGLE ON

The bar as Lee gratefully finds it

She gets her drink and turns walking through the crowd She

overhears a conversation between TOM CLANCY 40 famous
writer and a crowd of eager followers

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 6

TOM CLANCY
I don’t subscribe to the notion of
writers block

FOLLOWER
You never experience it

TOM CLANCY
Writers block is a term invented by the
writing community to justify their
laziness

The crowd laughs

TOM CLANCY (CONTD)
My success is nothing more than that I
have the dedication and stamina to sit
and get the work done It’s simple

FOLLOWER
Having Ronald Reagan talking about you
doesn’t hurt

TOM CLANCY
Well sure

Lee passes the conversation unimpressed

LEE
(walking by)
Jackass
FOLLOWER

Who’s that

Tom Clancy shrugs and Lee wanders not knowing anybody
People hustle by her having a good time

SEVERAL YOUNG GUESTS are huddled together and Lee eavesdrops

KAREN
You have to read them As an American

GUEST
Well sure

Lee looks around landing on SEVERAL OLDER PEOPLE sitting on
couches not talking to anybody

They line the perimeter of the room sipping their drinks
They’re old wallflowers

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 7

INT HALLWAY - EVENING 11

Lee walks down the hall that’s decorated with framed
photographs book jackets signed letters - it’s Marjorie’s
professional Memory Lane

She glances up to assess TWO FRAMED BOOK JACKETS One is
KILLGALLEN by Lee Israel and the other is MISS TALLULAH
BANKHEAD also by Lee

Unhappy with their placement she quickly swaps them out with
a couple of frames that are closer to her eye line

INT MARJORIE’S POWDER ROOM - EVENING 12
Lee is snooping in the cabinet and finds a drawer filled with
almost finished toilet paper rolls A dozen of them at least

Weird

She grabs the fullest one and drops it into her large bag
She takes the bar of guest soap as well

INT MARJORIE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 13

She snakes her way through the party and makes it to the
front door just as Marjorie stops her

MARJORIE
That was quick Did you get properly fed
LEE
This week Will you take my call
MARJORIE
(condescendingly)

Sure We’ll see

LEE
I have fascinating projects I’m working
on a lot of ideas - I just need my agent
to call me back

MARJORIE
(laughing to herself)
Well nobody needs a new biography on
Fanny Brice Lee We may disagree on what
is considered fascinating

She starts to walk away

MARJORIE (CONT’D)
Good night Lee

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 8

LEE
(stopping her)
Why do you have mostly used toilet paper
rolls in the drawer of your bathroom

MARJORIE
What

LEE
I just can’t figure it out

MARJORIE
You went through my bathroom cabinets

LEE
Just tell me I’m curious

MARJORIE
So that guests can have a full roll

LEE
That’s batshit Marjorie

MARJORIE
(to herself)
You would know

At the coat check Lee points to a very sophisticated long
wool coat

LEE
Yeah I lost the ticket but that’s the
one

The coat check guy doesn’t flinch but hands it to her

COAT CHECK GUY
Have a good night ma’am

Lee takes the beautiful coat with a smirk

14 INT LEE’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT 14

Lee sits on her couch drinking scotch with her new coat
slung over the couch On the TV Lillian Hellman’s black and
white film THE LITTLE FOXES plays It’s a scene Lee knows by
heart but that doesn’t stop her from enjoying every frame

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 9

Bette Davis is snuffing candles whilst quibbling with her
brothers Charles Dingle and Carl Benton Reid Lee loves this
LEE
(along with the TV)
There are lots of things to consider
After all they are first cousins
(then answering herself)
Well that isn’t unusual Our grandmother
and grandfather were first cousins

her mouth and offers one to the cat

the assistant RACHEL

RACHEL
You still have a balance Ms Israel

LEE
But there’s something wrong with her
She’s very old

RACHEL
I’m sorry The doctor told me to get at
least half the balance before we do any
tests

LEE
Dont you take a Hippocratic oath or
something Don’t you have to do
something

MS WHITMAN
If you want to borrow a book simply ask

LEE
I mentioned that I was a published

author This is my book

Ms Whitman inhales

MS WHITMAN

A4l EXT LINCOLN CENTER LIBRARY - DAY A4l
Lee crosses into the large library
41 INT LINCOLN CENTER LIBRARY - DAY 41

The table is covered with articles and books Lee is taking
notes on a pad

She separates some papers and finds TWO TYPED LETTERS SIGNED
BY FANNY BRICE Her eyes widen

She looks around - to let someone know the letters don’t
belong here - and then she changes her mind

She reads them with a kind of secret thrill

She glances around the room relieved that no one is looking
her way Quickly she drops the letters into her canvas bag

42 INT TWELVETREES BOOKSELLER - DAY 42

LEE
Well I’ve discovered that my cousin
Sydney was in possession of this
delightful bonne bouche I thought you
might be interested in it

She hands her one of the Fanny Brice letters protected in
plastic

ANNA
Fanny Brice One of my favorites
LEE
(finally)
Ive been working on a new biography on
her
ANNA

What a funny coincidence then that your
cousin had this

(beat)
Well she’s much more your style than
Estee Lauder

LEE
Right Thank you

ANNA
Didn’t she say “Wrong is for other
people” I love that

LEE
(impressed)
She did

Anna smiles and looks to the letter

LEE (CONTD)
Well what do you think

ANNA
I believe I could sell this
(beat)
I could offer you seventy five

LEE
(disappointed)
Oh

ANNA

I could pay more for better content It’s
a bit bland is all

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 30 42

LEE
(glancing at the letter)
True

Anna goes to write a check

LEE (CONTD)
Would you be able to pay cash

ANNA

Let me see if I have enough

(she checks a drawer)
I’m glad to hear you’re writing another
book Ill be the first to buy it Did
you hear Tom Clancy is going to get paid
3 million dollars to write more right-
wing macho bullshit What is the state of
the literary world

LEE
Are you kidding me That blowhard is
getting paid three million dollars

Anna is taken aback by Lee’s reaction

LEE (CONTD)

Everyone thinks they can be a writer I
guess Oh to be a white male who doesn’t
know he’s full of crap huh

ANNA
Oh - I totally agree Why do we celebrate
the famous over the actual great writers
of our day The culture is dying

Lee is struck by how Anna is saying exactly what she feels

LEE
My sentiments exactly

ANNA

(beat)
Ive tried to write a little Short
stories And I know better than to
presume they’re any good

(beat)
I can’t believe I just admitted that I’m
sure they’re terrible

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 31 42

Maybe they are maybe theyre not

Let me take a look

ANNA
Really

LEE
I’1l be honest

ANNA
Unfortunately I believe you

INT MARJORIE’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY 43
Lee barges into Marjorie’s office leaving the door open

LEE
I hear they got Tom Clancy three million
dollars to write some more red-baiting
propaganda

MARJORIE
Lee - I’ve had too long a morning already
for this

LEE
He’s a fraud

MARJORIE
What is your point

LEE
He was drinking sherry at your party No
self-respecting writer would drink
sherry

MARJORIE
Oh lord Lee

LEE
I need an advance for my Fanny Brice
book I need you to get me ten thousand
dollars I am months behind in my rent
and my cat is sick and isn’t that why I
have an agent

MARJORIE
(losing her cool)
I can’t get you an advance like that
Lee I just can’t

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 32

The door c

LEE
Give me one reason why that cocky shit
would get three million dollars and you
can’t get me ten thousand Are you that
bad of an agent

MARJORIE
(calling to her assistant
in the adjoining room)
Toni can you please close the door Ms
Israel and I have some sensitive business
to discuss

loses behind Lee

LEE
Id hate for her to hear a grown up
conversation

MARJORIE
Ill give you three reasons Number one
Tom Clancy’s famous

LEE
Well here we go

MARJORIE
I can’t get an advance for you because
nobody has ever heard of you- you’ve
written some successful biographies
sure and you disappeared behind your
subjects but that means nobody knows who
you are

LEE
Because I did my job

MARJORIE
Number two - Tom Clancy goes on every
radio show on Larry King to every book
signing and he plays the game he
hobnobs Meanwhile you’ve burned every
bridge I’ve made for you You’re
impossible to work with and everybody
knows it

LEE
See this feels beside the point If I’m
a good writer-

MARJORIE
Number three- nobody wants a book about
Fanny Brice

(MORE )

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 33
43 43

MARJORIE (CONTD)
There’s nothing new and sexy about Fanny
Brice Nobody will give you a ten DOLLAR
advance for a book about Fanny Brice

Lee is shocked but also kind of impressed She sits

LEE
I had a book on the New York Times best
seller list That has to count for
something

MARJORIE
I’ve known you a long time Lee It hurts
me to have to say this all to you

LEE
Tell me what to do then Marjorie I
have to do something I will take
anything Magazine pieces crackerbox
copy I’m not trying to get rich here
Im just trying to survive

MARJORIE
The way I see it you have two options-
either you become a nicer person who
gets along with others You put ona
clean shirt you stop drinking you say
“please” and “thank you”-

LEE
Oh youve got to be fucking kidding me-

MARJORIE
Which doesn’t seem like it’s going to
happen OR - you take the time to become
a name that people know and then maybe
maybe I will be able to get you paid
again

LEE
How the hell am I supposed to do that
I’m a 51 year old woman who likes cats
more than people That’s not “hot and
sexy” as youd say

MARJORIE
Write your book Something for you in
your voice

LEE

(scoffing)
Well-

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 34 43

MARJORIE
Youve been saying you were going to do
it for ten years

LEE
Well I would love to that sounds
delightful Marjorie but I need money
yesterday I have to pay my bills We
don’t all have ex-husbands who left us a
classic six on the park

Marjorie shakes her head offended and exhausted

MARJORIE

You can be an asshole if you’re famous
You can’t be unknown and be such a bitch
Lee

(then)
Nobody is going to pay for the writer Lee
Israel right now So I suggest you find
another way to make your living

Lee thinks about this

INT LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY 44

Lee sits in front of her typewriter She stares at the blank
page contemplating She types “This is me sitting down to
fucking write” And stops She glances at the other Fanny
Brice letter sitting nearby taunting her

She picks up the Fanny Brice letter and compares the
typeface It matches

She zips the sheet from the typewriter and rolls the Fanny
Brice letter into it She scrolls down and adds a PS

PS I have a new Grandkid and he got my
old nose Do I have to leave him an extra
something for repairs

She smiles and then heartily laughs to herself It’s a good
joke

INT TWELVETREES BOOKSELLER - DAY 45

laughing reading the letter She’s not aware of Lee’s
anxiety

ANNA
Yup I kind of grew up in here

LEE
It’s very beautiful

ANNA
A few of the shops are hanging on But
Barnes and Noble is killing us It’s
probably good he’s not around to see it
He hated chain stores His customers were
very loyal though They would sit right
here and drink scotch together

She reaches into a drawer and removes a bottle of scotch
Then runs off and returns with two glasses

Oh come on spill

Lee looks around She can’t keep it inside any longer

LEE
Alright fine can you keep a secret
JACK

I can’t fathom what crime you are
possibly committing Except a crime of
fashion of course

paper that go where Libraries

of a secret I could have told a rock and

gotten a better response

I can’t get caught Fools get caught

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 39

signature

LEE’S VOICE
Dear Sidney
I had no idea you knew Dottie Parker A
tragic loss but she has been dying for
decades Whether it was drink or
chemistry or character she was unable
after a time to write anything and that
made her sere and infinitely pathetic My
own friends are dropping like flies and I
am thankful of late when they live
through lunch

Having a difficult time tracing she tries to simply copy it
but it looks shaky

She looks around her place and takes an interest in her
ancient TV set

INT LEE’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 62
She is disemboweling it

INT LEE’S APARTMENT - JUST AFTER 63
Lee has placed the shell of the TV over a small lamp with no
shade The bare bulb illuminates the screen and makes for a

It appears completely genuine She signs another letter and
stares at her work

asked me to sell some of his treasures so

taste of the author’s personality but
these do just that

Lee can’t help but smile

LEE
Yes I thought so myself Very clever
man

PAUL

I can give you two hundred for them How
does that sound

Depending on the judge I think at worst
you could conceivably get a year and
change

Lee looks panicked

LLOYD (CONT’D)
Youll bring a book
(beat)
Look if you want me to represent you
youre going to have to do a few things
before appearing in court

LEE
Like what

LLOYD
Clean up your act First you’re getting
a job Any kind of job And second
youre enrolling in community service to
show how penitent you are

LEE

What - what kind of service
LLOYD

Something with children
LEE

Jesus no
LLOYD

Animals sick people Whatever You’re
going to show that you have turned over a
new leaf

(BEAT)
Youve got to go to AA

A149

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 106 147

LEE
That’s absurd

He stares at her It doesn’t seem possible that her spirit
could sink even lower

LEE (CONTD)
I want to ask you something
(beat)
So everyone I sold to - do you think
they all know

LLOYD
Yeah They probably all know But right
now that’s the least of your worries

INT JULIUS’ BAR - DAY 148

In the mostly empty bar dressed for court Lee sits and
drinks somewhat a pariah A few regulars whisper about her

EXT COURTHOUSE - DAY A149
Lee walks up the steps of the intimidating courthouse
INT COURTHOUSE - DAY 149

Lee and Lloyd sit on a bench outside the courtroom Lee is
sweating in her heavy jacket as she anxiously rubs her hands
against her thighs

LLOYD
We’re very lucky this is our judge Very
lucky She doesn’t waste time with things
like this I have a good feeling Try to
breathe

LEE
I’m scared

LLOYD
(handing her a mint
annoyed)
You smell like alcohol
She shrugs and takes the mint

INT COURTROOM - DAY 150

In a simple nearly empty courtroom Lee and Lloyd stand
before the JUDGE

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 107
150 150

LLOYD
(continuing)
She is seeking employment with Scholastic
books as a copy editor and has already
put in over forty hours of community
service at a cat shelter

JUDGE
(to Lee)
Before I render my verdict have you in
the last twenty-four hours used drugs
pills alcohol anything that could
affect your ability to understand what is
going on

LEE
No ma’am

JUDGE
Have you anything additional you would
like to say to the court before I offer
your sentence

LEE
Yes

Lloyd watches her carefully as she stands and takes a deep
breath What comes next begins as something rehearsed but
devolves into a stream-of-consciousness confession

LEE (CONTD)
I have been living in a state of enormous
guilt and anxiety for the past year Not
because I felt like I was doing something
wrong but because I was always afraid of
being found out I can’t specifically say
that I regret my actions-

Lloyd clears his throat urging Lee to watch herself

LLOYD
Lee-

LEE
I don’t I thoroughly enjoyed writing
these letters living in the world of
Dorothy Parker and Noel Coward
pretending I was something I am not In
many ways this has been the best time of
my life It’s the only time recently I
can remember being proud of the work I
was doing

(then)
(MORE )

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 108 150

LEE (CONTD)
But it wasn’t my work was it I was
hiding behind these people their names
Because if I’d actually put myself out
there done my own work then I would be
opening myself up to criticism And I’m
too much of a coward for all of that
I’ve lost my cat- the only soul that
truly loved me maybe ever- and I lost my
friend - who might have been an idiot
but tolerated me and was nice to have
around And I’ve realized that I’m not a
real writer In the end it was not worth
it

This hits Lee in a surprising way Lloyd looks at her
nervously She returns to her script

LEE (CONTD)
I will accept the judgement of the court
as valid and fulfill whatever sentence I
may receive with the full understanding
that I have earned said punishment

A moment The judge nods

JUDGE
Lee Israel the court sentences you to
five years probation plus six months
house arrest You may only leave home to
go to and from your place of employment
your work in the community and to
alcoholic’s anonymous meetings

LEE
(blurting)
I don’t have anywhere to go

JUDGE
You are not to leave the state or consort
with felons and you are to pay
restitution to your victims within your
means

Lloyd grins at Lee nodding Lee stares in disbelief
LLOYD
(quietly to Lee)

This is a good thing Very fair

But Lee is reeling The weight of everything is finally
settled on her and it is heavy

A151

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 109 150

LEE
(at her lowest)
Mm hmm Good

Lloyd doesn’t know what to say

EXT COURTHOUSE - DAY A151
Lee walks out of the courthouse emptied and exhausted

INT LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY 151
Lee enters her apartment It is eerily empty No typewriters
No Jersey No Jack Jersey’s empty food bowl sits on the

floor taunting Lee She checks her answering machine but has
no messages She collapses onto the couch She does not know
where she will go from here

EXT CENTRAL PARK - DAY 152

Lee sits on a bench waiting After a moment she sees ELAINE
45 coming toward her

LEE
Thanks for coming

ELAINE
It sounded important

LEE
It was It is My phone got shut off In
case you tried to call

ELAINE
I didn’t

They sit down and Elaine notices the cat hair on Lee’s
jacket picks at it

ELAINE (CONT’D)
I see you brought Jersey with you How is
that old bitch

LEE
That’s what I wanted to tell you Elaine
She just died

ELAINE
Oh

LEE
I figured since she was a gift from you-

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 110

Lee starts to tear up

ELAINE
Was she
(beat)
I’m so sorry Lee

LEE
(shrugging)
I got too attached to her

ELAINE
You going to get another

LEE
No I can’t replace her It wouldn’t be
right

ELAINE
Maybe in time

LEE
I do go to Aunt Eleanor’s pretty
regularly

ELAINE
Oh god I haven’t thought about that
place in years It’s still there On
96th

LEE
Exactly the same Different cats

ELAINE
(beat)
You still on 82nd

LEE
Where else would I be
ELAINE
You look all right You all right
LEE
You can’t imagine what I’ve had to do to
survive
ELAINE

We all have to do things we don’t want to

do

( )

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 111

LEE
Maybe I can’t remember the last time I
was doing something because I wanted to
do it

Elaine examines Lee concerned

This bit o

ELAINE
Are you sleeping Lee

f£ kindness hits Lee

LEE
Fits and starts But when you can’t
recognize your own life it’s hard to find
rest

ELAINE
Youre having one of those times You
just gotta ride it out

LEE
I was supposed to be something so
different than this Wasn’t I When we
were together people liked my work
right

ELAINE
That’s why you wanted to see me

LEE
No I mean I’ve wanted to see you for
a long time I’ve needed to see you
Elaine I just I’m in a crisis And
you know me

ELAINE
It always seemed more important to you
that people liked your work than that
they liked you

LEE
Well of course

ELAINE
No Lee That’s not healthy

LEE
I guess not But-

ELAINE
You were so miserable

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 112

152 A beat

LEE
No I wasnt

ELAINE
Yes you were

LEE
I was happy with you

ELAINE
Well I appreciate that We were happy
there For parts of it

LEE
It was more than parts of it

ELAINE
No Lee There was always a wall between
us Something I couldn’t penetrate

LEE
I tried God damnit I tried more with
you than with anyone ever

ELAINE
No you didn’t You did everything you
could to keep your distance You lied
you drank constantly you were self-
involved-

LEE
Well I didn’t say I was perfect

ELAINE
And the moment anyone wronged you you
cut them out It was like you were
looking for everyone to fail you so you
wouldn’t have stay connected

LEE
Well fuck I always thought of myself as
pleasantly prickly

ELAINE
More like a fortress of disdain I could
never get you to let down the wall- to
trust me- and at some point I just
stopped trying

LEE
I wish you hadnt

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 113
152 152

ELAINE
I don’t know why you were so afraid for
anyone to get to know you - maybe you
thought nobody would like what they saw
Such a shame

This takes Lee by surprise Elaine starts to stand up Lee
grabs her arm

LEE
Wait - don’t go

ELAINE
This isn’t my job anymore Lee To talk
you off the ledge It’s exhausting

LEE
Who is she

Elaine sighs she was trying to avoid this

ELAINE
Lee

LEE
I’m just curious

ELAINE
She’s a public advocate She’s warm and
it’s simple

LEE
Is she always a cunt to your old friends
I wouldn’t let her answer the phone if I
were you

ELAINE

And there it is I don’t know why I try

(she makes a motion of a

wall going up)
Youre never going to change Everyone is
always wronging you - nobody appreciates
you nobody gives you what you
deserve

(short beat)
And nothing is ever your fault

Lee is stunned
ELAINE (CONT’D)
I’ve got a class

INT LEE’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT A154
Lee lies in bed staring up at the fan She isn’t filled with
anxiety anymore She is numb She is lifeless replaying
Elaine’s words in her head She pulls out Anna’s short story
and begins to read

EXT TWELVETREES BOOK SHOP - DAY 154
Lee walks past Anna’s bookshop She sees Anna inside talking
to a customer She knows she can’t go in She stops and
watches though Suddenly Anna looks up and the two women make
eye contact

Anna breaks it and when she looks back up Lee is gone

Sadly Lee walks away

157 INT JULIUS’ BAR - AFTERNOON - SOME MONTHS LATER 157

Lee sits at a table - she doesn’t look good but she doesn’t
look bad either Craig brings her a scotch

CRAIG
Havent seen your face in here ina
while

LEE

Yeah well I’m only allowed to leave the
house for my AA meetings

Craig walks away shaking his head Suddenly the door opens
and Jack comes in He sees Lee approaches her table Is this
a coincidence Jack looks a little thin and walks with a
crutch babying one foot

LEE (CONTD)
Thanks for coming

JACK
(shrugging)
It was quite inconvenient I had to move
around some meetings but I had my
assistant cancel my afternoon

Lee smirks It’s kind of Jack to make this easier

LEE
Can I get you a drink I’m buying Ive
started counterfeiting money now

She smirks this tickles Jack

JACK
Not today
(off Lee’s surprise)
It’s my new meds Throwing my whole
system off Gin tastes like mouthwash
Takes the fun out of it

Lee is concerned but doesn’t press
LEE
I guess you were able to cut a deal

Ratting on me worked out

JACK
Three years probation

LEE
At least you’re out and about

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 116
157 157

JACK
So are you

LEE
No I’m at an AA meeting on 10th street

Jack laughs

JACK
Criminals at large
(then)
I couldnt imagine what was so important
that Lee Israel swallowed her pride and
asked me to meet her So spit it out

LEE
Im reconsidering

JACK
Oh just tell me

LEE
Well I’ve been thinking about writing
a new book About what happened About
what I did And about you if you’1l let
me

JACK
Like hell I will What would my boyfriend
think if he knew about my shadier
dealings

LEE
Do our crimes even count in your top ten
of shady dealings I doubt it

JACK
Fair enough But I don’t want a book out
there about me I’m a very private
person

Lee is quiet

LEE
I have to do something I have to write
again

JACK

What about Fanny Price

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 117

LEE
Brice No I think for once I would like
to write about one Lee Isreal As
terrifying as that sounds

JACK
I’m still mad at you you know You
treated me like shit I don’t think
youre a very nice person

LEE
I would agree with you

JACK
But I suppose you may be mad at me as
well

LEE
If you didn’t look quite so decrepit I
would be

JACK
(quietly)
Yes well I guess it’s not some huge
plot twist It was going to catch up to
me eventually

LEE
You have fucked your way through
Manhattan

JACK
I would like that on my tombstone

They share a morbid laugh
JACK (CONTD)
With the addition of but he steered

clear of the boroughs

LEE
Sure

After a beat
JACK
Will you make me 29 And with perfect

skin And don’t make me sound stupid

Lee is quiet realizing he is agreeing

CYEFM Final Shooting Draft 31317 118

JACK (CONTD)
Oh fuck it Write whatever you want It’s
not like anyone reads your books anyways

LEE
Ive already written five chapters

Jack laughs
LEE (CONTD)
(quietly)
Thank you

Lee reaches out and touches Jack’s hand This lingers for
just a moment and then Jack stands breaking it

JACK
Im late for a board meeting My driver
is waiting The life of a millionaire

They both smile going with the bit Jack starts toward the
door Crossing in front of Lee Lee stifles a little laugh

Jack looks back

JACK (CONTD)

What

LEE
No I was so tempted to trip you just
now

Jack laughs against his better judgement

JACK
Wow you’re a horrid cunt Lee
LEE
So are you Jack
JACK
Good luck
LEE
You too

He leaves

keyboard The place is cleaned up again but still Lee’s
EXT CENTRAL PARK — DAY 159

Springtime Lee sits on a bench content She eats a hot dog
and watches people pass

EXT STREETLAST BOOKSTORE - DAY 160

Lee walks down the street and backtracks having seen
something in a bookstore window that has caught her eye It’s
a mounted letter from Dorothy Parker One that Lee has
written

INT RENWICK and CO RARE BOOKS - DAY 161
Lee addresses the bookseller
LEE
My friend’s birthday is coming up and

he’d love to own that Dorothy Parker in
the window

BOOKSELLER
She’s a beauty isn’t she

LEE
Can I ask how much a letter like that
runs

BOOKSELLER

We’re asking nineteen hundred framed and
matted and she comes complete with a
letter of authenticity

Lee’s eyes widen

LEE
Does the letter of authenticity come with
a letter of authenticity

BOOKSELLER
Oh I can assure you It’s the real
thing No one can write like Ms Parker
could Not before and not since

The bittersweet compliment is music to her ears

LEE
Well that might be out of my price
range but thank you very much

INT LEE’S APARTMENT - DAY 162

Lee sits at her old typewriter (the one she already owned)
and writes

LEE’S VOICE
My dear sir I offer my droopy
salutations from the Great Beyond I
understand that you’re selling my
personal letters to the tune of nearly
two grand To think poor Lee Israel
received a tiny fraction of that sum when
she sold them to someone who then sold
them to you

EXT RENWICK and CO RARE BOOKS - DAY 163

We see the man through the front window reading this letter
He looks into the distance considering Disturbed he moves
to the shop window

LEE’S VOICE
I dearly hope this letter will not affect
the selling price of your valuable
artifact As I most famously muttered
mere moments after my cremation
“Darling excuse my dust”
Yours
Dorothy Parker

The bookseller removes the letter from the window display
