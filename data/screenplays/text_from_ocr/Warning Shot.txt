EXT CEMETERY - DAY 1

This is one of those country cemeteries that would be an
ordinary pasture without the grim slabs

AUDREY 30s in a flowing dress that gently rolls like waves
in the breeze stands next to

CHEYENNE 8 an adorable little likeness of her mother

Together they’re a symbol of all that’s beautiful about
life They gaze blankly at a casket in an open grave
pondering mortality

AUDREY
We should go

She puts her hands on Cheyenne’s shoulders Steers her toward
a single car parked on the gravel road

CHEYENNE
How come everyone left so soon

AUDREY
Probably had things to do

CHEYENNE
There weren’t that many people

AUDREY
Grandpa was pretty old

CHEYENNE
Then it seems like he would have
had more friends than anyone

AUDREY
Most of his friends have already
died sweetie

EXT FARMHOUSE - DAY 2

The house is small with add-ons isolated and derelict with
a couple of dilapidated buildings behind it an old barn and
machine shed Other than the dusty road leading to it it’s
surrounded by woodlands

Audreys car pulls up the gravel driveway stops behind the
house Audrey and Cheyenne climb out scan the area
CHEYENNE
Have I ever been here before

AUDREY
Yes You were too young to
remember I usually visited while
you were with grandma and grandpa
They approach the barn like they’re walking in the park

CHEYENNE
I thought this was my grandpa

AUDREY
No this was my grandpa

Cheyenne drifts toward a field as Audrey reaches the doorway
AUDREY (CONTD)

Don’t go too far Cheyenne And

don’t get your dress dirty
INT BARN - DAY 3
Audrey steps cautiously into the dingy building It’s filled
with a lifetime’s worth of dusty old farm equipment A COIL
OF ROPE hangs on the wall

Audrey touches an old harness smacks the dust off her hands

EXT FARMHOUSE GROUNDS - DAY 4
Cheyenne approaches a large woodpile When she gets close
a covey of quail suddenly erupts from the pile their
TWEETING filling the air

Caught off guard Cheyenne falls back onto the ground She
watches in wonder as the birds fill nearby trees

Audrey steps out of the barn to see what’s going on

AUDREY
What did you do

Cheyenne climbs off the ground and shrugs
CHEYENNE

Nothing I just walked to the
woodpile
AUDREY
Well come away from there Don’t
bother the birds

Cheyenne makes her way back

CHEYENNE
I didn’t

Audrey brushes Cheyenne’s dress off

AUDREY
I told you not to get dirty and
it’s the first thing you did

CHEYENNE
I’m sorry

She points to a dusty spot on Audrey’s dress Audrey brushes
it off

AUDREY
I guess I should have told myself
not to get dirty too

They share a laugh Audrey puts her arm around Cheyenne

I have to get the key from Mr
Pendleton

BOBBY
Those water rights have been in his
family since the eighteen hundreds

We now see the two men Bobby speaks to

First there’s JAWARI late 30s an African-American with a
moustache His face has a gentle quality

Then there’s RAINY 30s slouched in his chair His eyes
would be completely empty except for a sinister tinge
BOBBY (CONTD)

The old man’s personally owned them
since nineteen-thirty-nine It’s
going to take some persuasion

Bobby leans over his desk to bring full attention to what
he’s about to emphasize

BOBBY (CONT’D)
I want you to persuade him Do you
two know each other

Jawari and Rainy look each other over

JAWARI
I’ve seen him around

RAINY
I got a friend who said he bought a
skimpy bag of weed from him

Jawari stiffens offended

JAWARI
I don’t sell skimpy bags

RAINY
Had a bunch of stems in it

JAWARI
Bullshit

Bobby dismisses them with a wave as he sits

BOBBY
All right all right Jawari
Rainy Rainy Jawari Can you two
work together

Rainy leans on Bobby’s desk with a smart aleck smirk

RAINY
Hey man I’m a professional

Bobby looks at Jawari for an answer Jawari nods

BOBBY
All right listen I just want you
to loosen the old man up Do not
kill him

JAWARI
When do you want it done
BOBBY
Tomorrow Around noon Just hold
him there Ill drop by later with
the papers

RAINY
What if he gives us trouble

Bobby flashes Rainy a sharp look

BOBBY
Listen asshole What did I just
say Do not kill him He can’t sign
any papers dead

shotgun or something

BOBBY
He’s in his nineties Can’t you
handle a guy in his nineties

carrying a piece of paper with tape on it

Lucia They said they were going to
throw us in the pond

frowns looks up Cheyenne’s already in the bathroom with the

lots of places to go

They sit at the table to eat Audrey nudges a package of
crackers toward Cheyenne

AUDREY
There’s crackers if you want

Cheyenne grabs some crushes them over her soup
AUDREY (CONTD)
So you know Grandpa was kind of a
hermit in his old age I’m probably
the only family he really had any
contact with

She waits for a reaction Cheyenne sips her soup

AUDREY (CONTD)
He might leave me something in his
will

CHEYENNE
Really Like what

AUDREY
Like I don’t know Mr Pendleton
hinted he might leave me the farm

Yes he owned eighty acres

Cheyenne has no idea how much that is but it sounds
impressive
CHEYENNE
Wow that’s a lot

MR PENDLETON
Yes it is

He looks up at Audrey as he hands her the key

MR PENDLETON (CONT’D)
Do you have any plans for it if he
leaves it to you

Audrey stares at the key cautious about her words

AUDREY
It needs a lot of work I probably
couldnt sell it for much I’ve
been wondering if it wouldn’t be
cheaper to live there

Cheyenne looks up This is news to her

MR PENDLETON
Well the will won’t be officially
executed until next week We’ll go
over the specifics then

The first time I saw your mother
she was younger than you are now

CHEYENNE
Really

MR PENDLETON
And do you know she ran away from
me

Cheyenne giggles Audrey tries to recall

AUDREY
Seriously

MR PENDLETON

I stopped by for a visit one day
They said you took time to warm up
to people After about ten minutes
I caught you spying on me from the
corner of the house Another ten
minutes and you were offering me a
cup of pretend tea

Audrey and Cheyenne laugh

MR PENDLETON (CONT’D)
By the time I left you were
hanging onto my neck They had to
pull you off me

AUDREY
So I warmed up to you finally

MR PENDLETON
Oh yeah You were a clever one too
You used a coffee can lid fora
Frisbee and got it stuck on the
roof You tied a rope to a baseball
mitt and threw it up there

AUDREY
Now that sounds like me

CHEYENNE
Did she get it down

MR PENDLETON
She sure did

As the laughter subsides Mr Pendleton gives Audrey
sympathetic look

MR PENDLETON (CONT’D)
An answer has no purpose without a
problem you know

Audrey stares at him perceiving he’s referring to her
current situation now

AUDREY
But is there always an answer

MR PENDLETON
Oh I think a clever girl will find
one Sometimes you just need to
repurpose a few things

AUDREY
And if that doesn’t work

MR PENDLETON
Leave it to the wind It’ll
eventually blow off whatever’s on
the roof

AUDREY
I’m the one who runs away though
remember

MR PENDLETON
But you come back

His words lift Audrey’s spirits a little She glances at the
key and returns a fragile smile

AUDREY
Thanks

Rainy stands slings his rifle over his shoulder
RAINY
You must be the life of the party

Jawari digs the bullets out of his jacket puts them down on
the table Picks up the gun and opens the revolver

He picks up one bullet pauses before shoving it in the
chamber

He looks at Audrey She’s frightened He looks at Cheyenne
Same frightened face

Rainy sets his beer on the table reaches for the joint

RAINY
Let me have some of that

Jawari hands it to him

JAWARI
Here Maybe it’1l mellow you out

Rainy takes a big draw Blows out a fog of smoke coughing
RAINY
(while coughing)
Goddamn this shit could bore a
hole through a bank vault

Jawari laughs

JAWARI

Rainy holds it out to Audrey

RAINY
You want some

AUDREY
No thank you

RAINY

Cheyenne glances at her mother then shakes her head

RAINY (CONTD)
Well suit yourself

Rainy takes another big draw

JAWARI
You know what you are cowboy
Youre a glutton You don’t know
when to quit

Rainy coughs a cloud of smoke hands the joint to Jawari

RAINY
If you want it back you could just
ask You don’t have to get
personal

Jawari laughs taking the joint Rainy stares at Audrey with
that sinister tinge blooming in his eyes again He squeezes
between her and Cheyenne

Jawari notices keeps an eye as he takes a draw Rainy looks
Audrey up and down

RAINY (CONTD)
Comfortable

AUDREY
No Would you be tied up with two
psychos in your house

RAINY
It’s not your house yet remember
Besides Jawari isn’t a psycho

He laughs Jawari laughs along with him

RAINY (CONTD)
The worst thing Jawari has ever
done is sell skimpy bags of dope

JAWARI
Hey I told you man I don’t sell

skimpy bags

RAINY
Well now my friend wouldn’t lie
JAWARI
Your friend is a lying sack of
shit
RAINY

Now take it easy There’s nothin’
wrong with turning a profit

He looks down at Audrey’s lap

RAINY (CONTD)
Getting a little extra out of a
deal

He puts his hand on her leg

RAINY (CONTD)
Is there

He eases up her leg Audrey horrified looks at Jawari

JAWARI
Hey man come on

Rainy pauses looks at Jawari

RAINY
You know something Jawari I’m
getting awful tired of your
blocking What are you Zorro

JAWARI
Man all we got to do is wait for
Bobby You wanna fuck something

Rainy contemplates then leaps off the couch Walks around to
the other side of Jawari

RAINY
Youre a real killjoy you know it

JAWARI
Just chill man

Jawari takes a draw with his back to Rainy Rainy raises his
rifle pointed toward the ceiling

RAINY
Why don’t you take a nap

BAM He brings the rifle butt down on the back of Jawari’s
head Audrey screams Jawari slumps forward falls from the
chair into a heap on the floor

RAINY (CONTD)
Damn that guy was annoying He’1l
be pissed when he wakes up

He steps toward Audrey She draws back terrified

AUDREY
Please don’t hurt us

He sits between her and Cheyenne again

RAINY
Don’t fret darlin’ I wouldn’t
dream of forcing myself on you You
know what I want I want you to ask
for it Go on Ask for it

Audrey is so nervous she can hardly speak

AUDREY
I -- I don’t know what you want me

RAINY
I want you to ask for it
AUDREY
I can’t
RAINY

You can And you will

AUDREY
Cheyenne Can she leave

RAINY
No fuck that You can say it with
Cheyenne here She’s too young to
understand anyway

AUDREY
I can’t

Rainy stares at her long and hard

RAINY
Okay then

He turns a chair facing the doorway to the next room Pulls
Audrey off the couch and sits her in the chair Grabs some
rope and ties her ankles to the chair legs

RAINY (CONTD)
Then you can sit here and see what
happens next

AUDREY
Please I don’t know what you want
me to say

Rainy grabs Cheyenne by the arm

RAINY
Maybe Cheyenne will ask for it

He pulls Cheyenne off the couch She breaks into tears
scared to death even though she doesn’t understand what’s
happening Audrey is horrified

AUDREY
No please just tell me what you
want me to say

Rainy pulls Cheyenne along toward the next room
RAINY
Come on Cheyenne let’s leave

Audrey to think about things

AUDREY
Please I’ll say whatever you want

Rainy forces Cheyenne into the next room out of sight
leaving Audrey not knowing what’s happening Audrey screams
with tears streaming down her cheeks

AUDREY (CONTD)
Take me Take me

Her pleas are met with eerie silence

AUDREY (CONTD)
Take me Take me Take me

The silence is terrifying Audrey can hardly speak from
crying She makes one last desperate call

AUDREY (CONTD)
Take me

She finally breaks down sobbing uncontrollably Rainy peeks
back in the doorway holding his hand over Cheyenne’s mouth

RAINY
Well if you’re gonna beg

He pushes Cheyenne down on the couch Loosens the binds
around Audrey’s ankles

RAINY (CONTD)
I knew my charm would wear you
down

Audrey’s eyes meet Cheyenne’s The girl is traumatized

AUDREY
Sweetie I need you to be strong
for mama okay It’s going to be
all right

Then KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK at the front door Rainy shushes
Audrey He peeks out the window

RAINY
I think it’s one of those door to
door proselytizers

He waits There’s the sound of a pamphlet being left in the
door Rainy shakes his head steps to the

EXT FRONT DOOR - DAY 33

The man DAVID 30s is walking away carrying a Bible when
Rainy opens the door The pamphlet flutters to the porch

RAINY
What’s this
(picks it up)
Why it’s a pamphlet Whatever
could it be about

A smile fills David’s tender face as he returns He’s
innocent
DAVID
Hi My name is David I just wanted
to drop by to see if you’ve heard
the good news concerning our lord
and savior Jesus Christ

RAINY
Do you know what country you’re in

Davids smile fades

DAVID
I’m sorry

RAINY
It’s a simple question David Do
you know what country that
you are in

David digests unsettled by the awkwardness

DAVID
America

RAINY
That’s right This is America

DAVID
I’m sorry I don’t know what you’re
getting at

Rainy points down the road

RAINY
Did you see that church on the
corner down there

DAVID
Yes the big one It’s nice

RAINY
Well it’s one of about a million
on damn near every corner in the
country Do you really think you’re
gonna run into someone who’s never
heard of Jesus fuckin’ Christ

David just stares speechless
RAINY (CONTD)
I’1l tell you where you need to go
You need to go to one of those
remote areas of Africa with all
those crazy tribes that worship
tigers and shit That’s where
youll find people who’ve never
heard of Jesus

David shakes his head trying to focus

DAVID
Okay I’m sorry to bother you

RAINY
Wanna know why Christians don’t go
to places like that to proselytize
Because you’ll get a spear in your
ass that’s why They’1ll make a
necklace out of your fucking head

DAVID
I’1l move on

He starts to turn and sees

Audrey in the window horror all over her face She mouths

“Help me” David turns away

DAVID (CONTD)
Have a good day sir

Rainy glances toward the window suspicious Audrey’s gone
He leans back in the doorway Looks at David walking away

RAINY
You saw something didn’t you

David turns around

DAVID
I’m sorry

RAINY
Don’t act stupid You saw
something didn’t you

DAVID
I don’t know what youre talking
about I’1l move on

He turns away Rainy grabs his rifle walks out

pursuing

RAINY
That’s why I hate you people
Youll lie like the devil the
second it suits you

David turns sees the rifle Runs away Rainy chases

RAINY (CONTD)
Oh now you’re gonna run away like
a little pussy

Rainy gets close enough RAPS David on the head David hits
the ground senses reeling

RAINY (CONTD)
I hate liars David

INT FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 34

Rainy shoves David hands bound behind him to the floor
This is the living room with the large open space

RAINY
I’m not trying to be an asshole I

He walks into the next room still talking David listens
frightened unsure what’s going to happen

RAINY (0S) (CONT’D)
Audrey here did something to tip
you off

We hear Audrey moan as Rainy grabs her FOOTSTEPS approach

RAINY (0S) (CONT’D)
Then you acted like you were

Rainy tugs Audrey into the room shoves her to the floor
RAINY (CONTD)
Then I asked you if you saw
something and you lied
FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 35
Cheyenne toils with her binds She glances cautiously between

Jawari unconscious on the floor and the doorway to the next
room

LIVING ROOM - DAY 36
David looks up at Rainy with a tight face

DAVID
Look I don’t know what’s going on
I don’t know why you didn’t just
not answer the door

RAINY
This isn’t about me not answering
the door This is about you lying
and not being able to admit it

DAVID
Okay I lied

Rainy kneels by David
RAINY

Well now that’s not a sincere
admission now is it David

DAVID
I don’t know what you want me to
say

RAINY
Yeah there’s a lot of that going
around

He stands grabs the strap to his rifle to hold it secure

RAINY (CONTD)
I just want you

He kicks David in the stomach David draws in groaning

RAINY (CONTD)
- to admit

Rainy kicks him again And again And again While Audrey
screams for him to stop

RAINY (CONT’D) AUDREY
e you lied Now is that Stop it Leave him alone
so hard Just admit Please Stop it
you lied

Rainy finally stops breathing heavily Gazes down at David

RAINY (CONTD)
I just want a little sincerity
David Is that too much to ask

FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 37

Cheyenne works to free herself She’s halfway there She
focuses on the gun Resting on the table Then

Jawari groans Cheyenne quickly hides her hands behind her

LIVING ROOM - DAY 38
David looks up with watery eyes completely sincere

DAVID
I wasn’t sure what I saw I thought
I kind of knew But I wasn’t sure
I didn’t know what I was going to
do

He looks at Audrey face filled with regret

DAVID (CONTD)
I’m sorry I don’t know if I would
have helped you I wasn’t sure what
I saw I probably wouldn’t have
gotten involved

RAINY
Did you hear that Audrey Mr
Christian was just going to leave
you here to rot It’s okay
sweetheart You still have me

Rainy pulls David up to his knees
RAINY (CONTD)
I bet you wish that prayer bullshit
really worked right about now

JAWARI (0S)
Hey cowboy

Rainy whirls to see Jawari pointing the gun

JAWARI (CONTD)
I ought to blow your head off

Rainy steps back

RAINY
Come on Zulu You’re not mad at me
over that little bump on the head
are you I was just trying to get a
little time alone with my lady

Jawari steps closer still aiming the gun Notices David

JAWARI
Who the hell is this

RAINY
That’s my new friend David He
likes to preach the gospel when he
isn’t leaving women and children
behind to save himself

JAWARI
I owe you a whack

BAM Jawari cracks Rainy on the head with the handle of his
gun Rainy drops to the floor like a sack of flour Jawari
feels his head grimaces

JAWARI (CONTD)
I hope his head hurts as much as
mine when he wakes up

He turns toward Audrey and David

JAWARI (CONTD)
What happened

AUDREY
David knocked and he answered

Jawari shakes his head tries to think

JAWARI
All right Let’s all go in the
other room We’re gonna wait for
Bobby

INT BOBBY’S OFFICE - DAY 39

Bobby stuffs papers in his satchel His grandfather steps
into the room Bobby pauses when he sees him

BOBBY
What are you doing out of bed
Where’s your wheelchair

GRANDFATHER
Needed to walk a bit Get the blood
going

Bobby goes back to filling his satchel

GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
Off on business

BOBBY
Yeah I got somethin’ I gotta take
care of

GRANDFATHER
Busy man

He makes his way to a chair eases into it

GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
When I was young when I built all
this I was a busy man I had
nothing and I wanted everything

BOBBY
Yeah I know You told me

GRANDFATHER
My father told me If you wanna
make a million dollars youre
gonna have to do a million dollars
worth of work

BOBBY
Yeah I know You put it in a frame
and hung it in your office

GRANDFATHER
Everybody thinks getting rich is
getting lucky They think of
winning the lottery or hitting the
jackpot or picking the right
stocks They don’t think about the
hard work The sacrifice They
didn’t see me digging wells
shoveling mud so thick I couldn’t
lift my boots out of it

Bobby opens a desk drawer Inside is a PISTOL He glances at
his grandfather to make sure he can’t see then sneaks it
into his satchel

BOBBY
They know who you are once you got
money though don’t they

His grandfather nods preoccupied

GRANDFATHER
I worked so hard to make sure my
children wouldn’t have to Now I
wonder if I did the right thing

Bobby stops in the middle of closing his satchel

BOBBY
Why would you say that We’ve got
money don’t we That’s power
Nobody pushes us around

GRANDFATHER
I remember the thirst Bobby The
parched mouth and the blistered
lips It was all about the land and
the pipes in those days They
worked us like a chain gang
Somebody else decided when you got
a break When you got a drink I
said to myself one day I’m gonna
have all the water I’m gonna dig
in this dirt until the land bleeds
No one is ever gonna tell me when I
can drink again

Bobby rounds the desk to help his grandfather up

BOBBY
Come on Let’s get you back to bed

His grandfather ignores him lost in nostalgia
GRANDFATHER
A man should have a right to drink

water whenever he wants

BOBBY
I agree but I gotta go

Bobby’s grandfather stands to go with him
GRANDFATHER

I remember the Bendix washing
machine

INT BOBBY’S GRANDFATHER’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Bobby helps his grandfather walk to the bed He’s still going

on about the past
GRANDFATHER
When you get old things change
You can’t stop it

BOBBY
I know

Bobby helps him sit on the edge of the bed

GRANDFATHER
Your grandmother was right you
know

BOBBY

About what

GRANDFATHER
About the vacation She wanted us
all to go to the World’s Fair Expo
fifty-eight In Brussels Your
father was just a boy Your
grandmother said we needed to spend
time together as a family I yelled
at her and gave her this spiel
about providing a better life for
us

Bobby helps him lie back

GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
Now look at everything My son went
to prison because he wanted money
the easy way He didn’t want to
earn it And water You just turn
on the faucet Nobody thinks twice
about it Your grandmother is gone
God rest her soul and there’1ll
never be another like her And me
I’m lying here taking my last
breaths wishing I’d gone to
Belgium when I had the chance

Bobby pulls the blanket up for him

GRANDFATHER (CONT’D)
They say nobody dies wishing they’d
worked more But they don’t tell
you what you do wish for All the
little things that meant nothing
before become so important

Bobby frowns impatient and disinterested

BOBBY
I really gotta go okay

He moves toward the door leaving his grandfather staring
wistfully at the ceiling

GRANDFATHER
That’s life Bobby Nothing becomes
everything and everything becomes
nothing

INT FARMHOUSE FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 41

Audrey and Cheyenne are on the couch David sits ina
recliner next to it Jawari is at the table with his gun on
top

JAWARI
This was just supposed to be a
simple job All we had to do was
get the old man to sign the papers
Now here we are with three
hostages The old man is dead

Jawari pauses thinking Audrey breaks the silence
AUDREY

If I sign the papers whenever this
Bobby gets here will you let us

all go

JAWARI
That’s the plan You can’t tell
anyone

AUDREY

We won’t say anything I don’t even
want the water rights You could
have just asked me for them I
can’t take care of all the pipes
and filters anyway

Jawari gazes at her a moment then laughs

JAWARI
We could have just asked for them

He laughs harder As it dissipates Audrey takes a chance
AUDREY

So how did you get mixed up in all
this You seem nice

Jawari stops laughing looks at her

JAWARI
Lady don’t get the wrong idea I’m
not that nice

Audrey hesitates still trying to gauge Jawari

AUDREY
Thank you

JAWARI
What is this You trying to use
psychology or something

AUDREY
I’m just thankful for what you did

JAWARI
Really ‘Cause it sounds like
you’re trying to get to know me
Like maybe you think if I get to
know you I’1ll be more reluctant to
hurt you

AUDREY
It’s not like that

JAWARI
You watch too much TV Audrey

Audrey decides it’s best to just stay silent Jawari rises

JAWARI (CONTD)
I have to go to the bathroom You
think you can stay here without
supervision while I do that

Audrey nods Jawari steps to the door

JAWARI (CONTD)
I can hear what’s going on out
here

He steps into the next room Audrey Cheyenne and David
exchange nervous glances

Audrey quietly rises motions Cheyenne and David to come with
her David balks Audrey and Cheyenne sneak to the front
door Audrey stops notices David has stayed behind

Their eyes meet David shakes his head trying to discourage
them Audrey struggles to get her bound hands high enough to
unlock the bolt

CLACK It’s not that loud but in this quiet room and under
the circumstances it may as well be pots and pans clanging

Audrey manages to turn the doorknob

CREAK The door opening is like tires squealing in the
silence Audrey opens slowly to mitigate the noise

Finally it’s open enough Audrey backs out

EXT FRONT DOOR - DAY 42

As soon as Audrey turns to run she bumps right into
Jawari She gasps

JAWARI
I knew I couldn’t trust you
Audrey

He ushers them back into the

INT FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 43
Audrey and Cheyenne step back into the room

AUDREY
Can you blame us

Jawari gestures for them to sit

JAWARI
No but it means I can’t leave you
alone for a second

Audrey and Cheyenne sit back on the couch Jawari sits at the
table rubs his face disappointed

JAWARI (CONTD)
Damn Audrey I really do have to
shit too

AUDREY
I promise I won’t do it again

JAWARI
You think I’m gonna trust you now

AUDREY
There’s no way I can know whether
or not it’s a trick

JAWARI
I know I can trust preacher Damn
preacher I can’t believe you
didn’t even try to escape

DAVID
I’m trying to keep us alive

JAWARI
Looked more like you were trying to
keep yourself alive

LIVING ROOM - LATER

Rainy rouses Feels his head Winces Struggles to get
bearings Looks over and sees the rifle next to him

FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Rainy appears in the doorway rifle trained on Jawari

RAINY
Zulu

Jawari looks up not the slightest bit scared

JAWARI
Put the gun down You’re not going
to shoot anyone

RAINY
First off I told you it’s a
goddamn rifle

He lowers the rifle focused on a rant now

RAINY (CONTD)
A rifle Don’t you know the fuckin’
difference

He holds the rifle up by the barrel

RAINY (CONTD)
A rifle has a goddamn rifled bore
It causes the bullet to come out
spinning Like a football A gun
has a smooth bore so its accuracy
is shit

He aims the rifle at Jawari

his

RAINY (CONTD)
Secondly I thought you knew me
better What makes you think I
won’t shoot your ass dead

Jawari picks the MAGAZINE for the rifle off the table holds
it up for Rainy to see

JAWARI
I took the bullets out You’d think
a gun expert such as yourself would
have noticed his magazine was
missing

Rainy spins his rifle over sees the empty slot

RAINY
Son of a bitch

JAWARI
Youre done playing cowboy From
here on we just wait for Bobby

Rainy stares a moment then lowers the rifle completely
changing his tune Ambles toward Jawari

RAINY
Ah shit I was just messin’ with
you I wasn’t gonna shoot you

Jawari grabs his gun points it at Rainy

JAWARI
Just have a seat We wait for
Bobby

RAINY

Can’t I even sit at the table

JAWARI
That’s too close

RAINY
Fine I’1l1 sit on the couch with
Audrey

JAWARI
No
(to David)
You sit on the couch
(to Rainy)
You take the recliner

David switches to the couch Cheyenne scoots over to be in
the middle Rainy saunters to the recliner

RAINY
Fine I wanted the recliner anyway

JAWARI
I can’t believe the mess youve
made

Rainy plants himself in the recliner

RAINY
Me I was just having a little fun
Like the old days Rape pillage
burn and all that

Rainy glances at the small wood-burning stove next to him
There are several thin logs on top and a couple of larger
ones at the base Rainy pulls out his balisong

RAINY (CONTD)
Do you mind if I whittle while we
wait

He grabs a thin log Slings the knife open by spinning it
gracefully around his fingers

JAWARI
I thought you hated trees

RAINY
I do That’s why I don’t mind
cutting them up
Jawari sighs Rainy idly whittles
RAINY (CONTD)
I’1ll carve you a little tiki
statue
Jawari rolls his eyes A few moments of silence go by
RAINY (CONTD)
Hey Audrey Want me to make you
something

Audrey pauses staring not sure what to say Turns away

AUDREY
Just make your tiki statue
RAINY
I don’t think Jawari appreciates my
efforts Besides you’re much
prettier than Jawari

AUDREY
I don’t want anything from you

RAINY
Oh Audrey that’s cold That hurt
my feelings

AUDREY
I doubt you have any feelings

RAINY
That’s not true I’m a sensitive
guy Really

He’s met with cold silence

RAINY (CONTD)
Let me ask you something If I was
just some guy you met And you
didn’t know anything about me
Would you even talk to me

She turns her face toward him still not answering
RAINY (CONTD)
If I just walked up to you
somewhere and you didn’t know me
If we talked just about simple
things And I didn’t do anything to
creep you out What would you think
of me
Audrey vacillates uncertain then softly answers

AUDREY
You might fool me

Rainy smiles

RAINY
I fool myself sometimes

Audrey raises her chin strong with a bit of defiance

AUDREY
But I do know you

The smile fades from Rainy’s face

AUDREY (CONTD)
I know all I need to know You’re
evil You’re cruel and vicious
Youre a monster And I wouldn’t
want to talk to you I wouldn’t
want to see you I wouldn’t want to
have anything to do with you

Rainy scowls speechless for once Jawari laughs Rainy
glances angrily at him Jawari keeps laughing as he pulls a
bag and rolling papers from his jacket pocket

JAWARI
You struck the fuck out man

RAINY
Hey fuck you Zulu

Jawari just laughs more Starts rolling a joint Rainy fights
to compose himself When he calms down enough it’s like
another personality washes over him He chuckles

RAINY (CONTD)
That’s pretty good Audrey You
really got me That’s funny

He starts whittling again

RAINY (CONTD)
You know what I’m gonna make you
Audrey A little giraffe You like
giraffes don’t you Everyone likes
giraffes I don’t know anyone who
doesn’t like giraffes

JAWARI
I didn’t think there was anyone who
didn’t like trees

Rainy pauses

RAINY
I was in the woods for weeks All
those trees became like prison
bars Who’s ever had an experience
like that with giraffes
(to Audrey)
Do you like giraffes Audrey

AUDREY
I don’t have anything else to say
to you

Jawari laughs as he puts his joint in his mouth

JAWARI
Oooh she shuts him down
completely

RAINY
Hey let me have a hit off that

Jawari digs out a lighter

JAWARI
Nope You stay over there

Rainy eyes Jawari a moment Smirks with a chuckle as he
resumes whittling He focuses on Cheyenne

RAINY
What about you shy one Do you
like giraffes

Cheyenne nods

RAINY (CONTD)
You know a lot of people think
giraffes are weak because they got
those long necks But did you know
a giraffe could kick a lion’s head
off

Jawari laughs
JAWARI
A giraffe couldn’t kick a lion’s
head off Not with those bony legs

RAINY
They’re bigger than you think

JAWARI
They’re not that big

RAINY
Their legs can get taller than a
man Their hindquarters can get
bigger around than my waist
Jawari keeps laughing as he blows smoke

JAWARI
Bullshit

Rainy shakes his head

RAINY
I can’t believe you’re going to
smoke that all by yourself

JAWARI
Hey man you ever heard of paying
for it

RAINY

I paid for the beer

JAWARI
I didn’t drink any beer

RAINY
How much you want for a joint

Rainy pulls out his (Notta’s) wallet Slips out two dollars

RAINY (CONTD)
I’1l give you two bucks

JAWARI
Two bucks

RAINY
How much you want

Jawari starts rolling a joint
JAWARI
I’1l take two bucks and you calm
the hell down how’s that sound
Rainy grins Sets his sights on David
RAINY
So what church do you belong to I
know you’re not Mormon They travel
in pairs

He glances at Jawari They both laugh David speaks softly

DAVID
Church of the Living Word

RAINY
What is that Jehovah’s Witnesses

DAVID
It’s protestant
Blue (mmddyyyy)

RAINY
What do they think about you being
a homo

David looks up stunned silent

RAINY (CONTD)
That’s what I thought You know
that’s a sin according to your
bible right

David forces a response

DAVID
I’m not gay

RAINY
Just like you didn’t see Audrey

David averts his eyes caught out

RAINY (CONTD)
I bet you spent your whole life
trying to get away from it I bet
you try and pray it away every day

David insists

DAVID
No I don’t I’m not

RAINY
It’s in the eyes

DAVID
You can’t tell if someone’s gay
just by looking at them

RAINY
Yes you can

He leans a little closer to David provocatively

RAINY (CONTD)
They promised you inner peace but
you didn’t get shit did you Door
to door in the hot sun for Jesus
and all you get in return is hi and
bye on Sunday Put your money in
the plate and see you next week

DAVID
No It’s more than that

e FF HF

Blue (mmddyyyy) 59A

RAINY
You ever feel the Holy Spirit in
you

DAVID

A couple of times

RAINY
Ever speak in tongues Allah ballah
ballah

Jawari bursts out laughing Tosses the joint to Rainy

JAWARI
There you go man Just mellow out

Rainy sticks the joint in his mouth

JAWARI (CONTD)
(re his lighter)
I want this back

Jawari tosses the lighter Rainy catches it Lights the joint
and takes a big draw Blows smoke like all the tension is
leaving his body with it

RAINY
Ah This is some fine green my
friend Not nary a crack or a pop
of stem nor seed

He tosses the lighter back Jawari catches it

JAWARI
I told you my stuff doesn’t have a
bunch of stems in it

Jawari pulls out a small bag of cocaine Rainy perks up
Jawari spreads some of the powder onto the table top

RAINY
You need to borrow my knife

Jawari pulls a switchblade from his pocket Pushes a button
forward FLICK A blade springs out Jawari grins

JAWARI
No thank you cowboy I got a real
knife

He starts cutting up the coke

RAINY
A balisong is better than a
switchblade

JAWARI
Come on seriously Think about it
My flick to your click-clack See
the difference Two steps to one

RAINY
Fan knives are more reliable

JAWARI
You push a button you got a knife
What could be more reliable
Besides everybody knows
switchblades are cooler than
butterfly knives There isn’t even
a competition

Rainy starts carving on his log

RAINY
You can’t carve a giraffe with a
switchblade The blade’s too
flimsy

Audrey interrupts
AUDREY

Do you have to do all this in front
of my daughter

Jawari pauses almost as if he sees her point Rainy blows

smoke right toward Audrey and Cheyenne

RAINY
You can’t get high off secondhand
pot smoke If you could we’d all
be high off Jawari

BING Jawari retracts the blade of his knife

JAWARI
It’s just some coke I’11 keep it
away from her

RAINY
I’1l tell you what Audrey I’1l
put out the joint if you’1l tell me
about yourself

Audrey looks at Rainy reluctant to agree

AUDREY
What do you want to know

RAINY
What do you do for a living

AUDREY
I’m a waitress Now will you stop
blowing smoke at us

Rainy takes a draw Blows smoke at Audrey

RAINY
After you answer some questions

AUDREY
How many questions

RAINY
Oh I don’t know Let’s say five

AUDREY
I’ve already answered one

RAINY
Okay then Four more Were you
ever a cheerleader

Audrey is caught off guard
AUDREY

What does that have to do with
anything
RAINY
I’m asking the questions

AUDREY
No

RAINY
Were you popular in high school

AUDREY
That’s completely subjective

Rainy wags his finger at her as he leans forward

RAINY
No No see it’s not Whether or
not you were popular in high school
will tell me virtually everything
about you

AUDREY
How is that

RAINY
Because high school is where people
are shaped for the rest of their
lives What you were then versus
what you are now tells me
everything

Audrey muses over those words a moment

AUDREY
Well I don’t know whether I would
be considered popular or not

RAINY
Yes you do People know whether or
not they were popular in high
school

Audrey pauses hesitant to answer

AUDREY
I was valedictorian

Rainy leans back excitedly

RAINY
I knew there was something about
you And now youre a waitress
See that tells me a lot Did you
go to college

Audrey answers with an air of sadness

AUDREY
I went for a couple of years but
had to drop out

Rainy puts the joint out It’s nearly finished now anyway

RAINY
Look how much we’ve learned in just
four questions You were
valedictorian You dropped out of
college and became a waitress

Rainy leans forward with a telling smirk

RAINY (CONTD)
And don’t think I didn’t notice the
wording You “had to” drop out Not
“I dropped out” But “had to”

AUDREY
It doesn’t mean anything Lots of
people drop out of college

RAINY
Not lots of valedictorians

AUDREY
It had more to do with money than
anything else

RAINY
A valedictorian who can’t get a
scholarship

AUDREY
Is that your final question

RAINY
No My final question is

He ponders His eyes rest on Cheyenne

RAINY (CONTD)
My final question is did you drop
out because you were pregnant

Audrey gazes at him stunned speechless She looks at
Cheyenne Cheyenne looks up at her mother

AUDREY
Cheyenne is the best thing that
ever happened to me
Rainy sighs annoyed

RAINY
That’s what every parent says
That’s such a generic load of
bullshit

He leans toward Cheyenne

RAINY (CONTD)
Let me tell you something shy one
People lie like lies will magically
turn to money And no one lies more
than parents

AUDREY
Sounds like someone had a bad
childhood

Rainy smirks

RAINY
Kids come from fuckin’ So don’t
act like you did somethin’ noble

AUDREY
Do you have to talk that way in
front of Cheyenne

Rainy shifts his focus back to Cheyenne

RAINY
Parents have babies for two
reasons They can’t control
themselves sexually and babies are
cute

Rainy’s aggression unsettles Cheyenne Her eyes well up

RAINY (CONTD)
But babies grow up And as they do
the shine wears off Then parents
start resenting the burden That’s
all parents

AUDREY
Leave her alone

Cheyenne starts crying

AUDREY (CONTD)
That’s not true Cheyenne
RAINY
It is true All parents reach a
point where they long for the
freedom they once had They
secretly dream of all the things
they might have achieved if they
weren’t stuck

Audrey looks at Cheyenne desperate to comfort her

AUDREY
That’s not true I’ve never once
regretted having you

RAINY
See Audrey you’re just like
everyone else Why can’t you just
be honest

AUDREY
Youve had your last question Now
it’s my turn to answer

She looks down at a tearful Cheyenne

AUDREY (CONTD)
This is the truth Cheyenne I
swear Yes I’ve had regrets in
life I’ve screwed up a lot of
things But I screwed them up Not
you

She looks up at Rainy

AUDREY (CONTD)
It’s true I got pregnant in
college I dropped out because I
couldn’t afford it

Nostalgia washes over her face

AUDREY (CONTD)
I didn’t know what I wanted to do
with my life anyway Motherhood
seemed as good a purpose as any

Audrey’s eyes meet with Cheyenne’s

AUDREY (CONTD)
It was the hardest thing I’ve ever
done It was tough and I barely
scraped by I thought so many times
Id never make it But I swear I
never once regretted it

Cheyenne faintly smiles Rainy gauges Audrey unconvinced

RAINY
There’s something you’re not
telling us

Cheyenne looks indignantly toward Rainy

CHEYENNE
Why are you so mean

Jawari laughs as he pulls out a straw

JAWARI
Yeah cowboy why don’t you tell us
about your family

He snorts a line of coke off the table Sniffs and tweaks his
nose

RAINY
I’1l tell you about my family if
youll give me a couple of lines

Jawari nods

JAWARI
Okay I gotta hear this

RAINY
Well I wasn’t no high school
valedictorian I can tell you that

He and Jawari snicker

RAINY (CONTD)
My old man was a con artist

JAWARI
Why am I not surprised

RAINY
We travelled from place to place
all the time I was helping him run
a shell game when I was only six

Jawari laughs

JAWARI
Little Rainy

RAINY
I remember he broke into a used car
lot office to steal keys one Sunday
afternoon And some people showed
up thinking the lot was open He
sold ‘em a car

JAWARI
He sold ‘em a car

Rainy drifts off Shakes his head in disbelief

RAINY
He filled out the paperwork and
everything He even pretended to
call and check on their credit

He looks up at Jawari still in awe after all these years

RAINY (CONTD)
The banks weren’t even open

JAWARI
Damn Rainy your old man had a big
set of balls on him

RAINY
I asked him why he did it and he
just said “I don’t know I just
wanted to see where it went”

AUDREY
Where was your mother

Rainy snaps out of his trance looks at Audrey

RAINY
I never knew her

Jawari snorts another line Raises his head twitching

JAWARI
So you just ran around with your
dad That’s pretty cool

Rainy drifts off again This time there’s something eerie
about the whole thing

RAINY
When I was twelve we broke into a
house to rob the place There was
just supposed to be a woman alone
My dad made me wait in the living
room I could hear her begging

Audrey swallows nervous about where this is going David and

Jawari both have the same look

RAINY (CONTD)
Then I heard these noises I didn’t
really know what it was at the
time Then her husband came home I
ran to get my dad When I opened
the door I saw him on top of her
He was so mad

Rainy sinks deeper into the memory

RAINY (CONTD)
He threw a pillow at me Told me to
get out I guess the pillow hitting
a lamp let her husband know we were
there He got a gun

Rainy’s eyes look as if he’s there witnessing it all over

RAINY (CONTD)
I climbed out the window first and
hid in the bushes I heard a shot
I saw my dad hit the ground He
just looked at me His eyes were
open but I could tell he was dead

Jawari gazes at Rainy spellbound

JAWARI
Wow That’s fucked up man

RAINY
I went to a state house I’ve been
a menace to society ever since

He chuckles Stops laughing when David speaks

DAVID
“Put up again thy sword into his
place for all they that take the
sword shall perish with the sword”

JAWARI
Is that from the Bible

DAVID
Jesus said it When they came to
arrest him one of his disciples
cut off the ear of the high
priest’s servant Jesus put the ear
back on and said those words
JAWARI
Jesus put someone’s ear back on
After it was cut off

Rainy glares fighting to contain a dark fury

RAINY
Give me some Kool-Aid and a glass
of water and I’1l show you how to
turn water into wine

DAVID
Jesuss miracles are documented

RAINY
By who His disciples The same
people who made a living off him
That’s a little like Copperfield’s
cable pullers claiming he can
really fly isn’t it

DAVID
There were others Jesus healed
people

RAINY

Ever hear of the immune system

DAVID
The immune system can’t make the
blind see

RAINY
Ever hear of a setup You fake
stuff for money

DAVID
All those people wouldn’t lie

RAINY
‘Cause people are known for their
honesty right

David pauses musing Looks away

RAINY (CONTD)
Wanna see a magic trick I bet I
can make a line of coke disappear
(to Jawari)
What do you say bro Look I’1l
put the rifle down

Rainy lays his rifle on the floor Holds up the knife

RAINY (CONTD)
I’1l put the knife down

He sets it on the stove-top and shows his hand empty front
and back Holds up the log

RAINY (CONTD)
I’1l put the log down

He sets the log down NEXT TO THE KNIFE Raises his hand to
show it empty PALM SIDE ONLY

RAINY (CONTD)

I need something to help me relax
after all this emotional
outpouring

As he says this we move behind him where we see the knife
blade is clipped between his middle fingers hidden from
view Jawari laughs oblivious

JAWARI
Okay come on You earned it

Rainy slowly approaches hands still in the air

RAINY
Did I ever tell you why I was on
the run from the police when I
spent all those weeks in the woods

Jawari shakes his head holds a straw out Rainy reaches for
it with his empty hand With his other hand he

Flicks his wrist slinging the knife into his hand

RAINY (CONTD)
Murder

He grabs Jawari’s hand as he stabs him in the gut Jawari
grunts doubles over The hostages stiffen horrified

RAINY (CONTD)

I killed my ex girlfriend and her
lover I had to change my identity
and everything

He lets go Jawari slumps over leaving Rainy with a bloody
knife in one hand and the straw in the other He snorts a
line off the table Shakes his head twitching

RAINY (CONTD)
That’s what I’m talkin’ about

Jawari shoves Rainy away Grabs his switchblade and starts to
push the button Rainy puts his hand over it

BING The spring releases but the blade doesn’t emerge

RAINY (CONTD)
See the thing about switchblades
the blade has to lock

He stabs Jawari in the gut again Jawari grunts

Rainy steps back Jawari turns the knife handle upside down
The blade limply slides out

RAINY (CONTD)
If something blocks it on the way
out it’s like a limp dick I told
you balisongs were better

Jawari carefully grabs the blade with index finger and thumb
Pulls it out until it locks with a CLICK He looks up at
Rainy face pale Sweating Quivering

RAINY (CONTD)
What’s a matter Zulu You look a
little peaked

Jawari raises his blade The two men square off for a knife
fight Rainy laughs playfully

RAINY (CONTD)
This is one of those what if
scenarios like what happens when a
shark meets a killer whale

He waves his knife

RAINY (CONTD)
I’m the killer whale and you’re the
shark

Jawari takes a meager stab at Rainy and misses Rainy slashes
Jawari’s arm Jawari yells

RAINY (CONTD)
Looks like the killer whale is
winning

Rainy stabs Jawari in the stomach Twists the blade Jawari’s
eyes have a look of certain death

RAINY (CONTD)
That’s the same look my daddy had

Jawari slumps to the floor by the table Rainy kneels wipes
the blood on the back of Jawari’s shirt

When he stands he folds the knife and puts it away Snorts
another line

He raises his head sniffing and fidgeting Audrey and the
others watch panicked Rainy picks up the magazine

AUDREY
Please don’t hurt us

Rainy steps toward the recliner

RAINY
My giraffe’s not good enough for
you remember

He grabs the rifle Inserts the magazine

AUDREY
I’1l do anything you want Just
don’t hurt Cheyenne

David sits forward

DAVID
Look there was no reason for this
to escalate to murder There still
isn’t He may still be alive

Rainy glances at Jawari Slides a round in the chamber

RAINY
Thanks for pointing that out
David

BANG He shoots Jawari in the back The hostages avert their
eyes

RAINY (CONTD)
This is just sell-out central
around here today isn’t it First
Audrey drags you into it Then you
try to weasel out of helping her
Now you want to make sure Jawari is
dead

DAVID
I didn’t mean it like that

RAINY
What you mean is to keep yourself
alive Even at the expense of poor
Audrey and Cheyenne here

He aims the rifle at David

RAINY (CONTD)
So I’ll tell you what I want you to
do I want you to pick someone
Whoever you pick gets killed and
the other two can live Which one’s
it gonna be David

David fights to keep composed Sweat beads on his forehead

DAVID
I can’t make that choice

RAINY
Oh but you must You’re the one
who goes around door to door asking
everyone to make the most important
decision of their lives right there
on the spot

DAVID
I can’t

RAINY
You better

Davids eyes dart around His mind races for a way out
Finally he relents

DAVID
No I won’t choose

RAINY
All right then I’ll make you
choose

Rainy trains the barrel directly at Cheyenne’s face

AUDREY
No Please Don’t hurt my daughter

RAINY
Shut up

AUDREY
Shoot me

RAINY
Shut up You’re too good for me

Then David leaps from the couch and runs Rainy aims
David reaches the threshold to the

LIVING ROOM - DAY 46

BANG A bullet rips through his knee David groans as he
tumbles to the floor Rainy storms into the room

RAINY
You cowardly piece of shit

He pulls David up leans him against the doorframe

FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 47

Rainy tromps to Cheyenne and aims at her face again Tears
stream down the little girl’s cheeks

RAINY
(to David)
I’m going to count down from ten to
one You’re going to choose between
yourself and Audrey If you don’t
make a choice by the time I get to
one then your choice is Cheyenne

Audrey bawls helplessly

AUDREY
Please don’t hurt my daughter

RAINY
Shut up You don’t get a choice
The choice is David’s Are you
ready David

DAVID
Please

David tries to move his leg Yells in pain

RAINY
Here we go

Audrey begs while Rainy counts We cut back and forth between
the faces of all of them

RAINY (CONT’D) AUDREY
Ten nine eight Please No I’m begging
seven six five you I’11l do anything No
four three two Shoot me Shoot me

David softly murmurs

DAVID
Shoot me

Rainy pauses Turns to David lowering his rifle

RAINY
What’s that

DAVID
Shoot me

Rainy approaches him
RAINY
I’m impressed You finally grew
some balls
He raises the rifle to David’s face
RAINY (CONTD)
I’1l give you one last chance to
change your mind
David looks at Audrey his face quivering
DAVID
I’m sorry He’s right I’ve been a
coward I was afraid I’ve been
afraid my whole life Always
running away

He looks up at Rainy courage filling his face

DAVID (CONTD)
I’m not afraid anymore

Rainy braces the stock against his shoulder
RAINY
Look at the bright side You won’t
have to go door to door no more

Audrey’s voice cuts across the room

AUDREY (0S)
I was raped

Everyone turns toward Audrey The room seems to freeze that
way for a moment

Audrey fights back a flood of emotions

AUDREY (CONTD)

In college At a frat party I was
smart enough to get a scholarship
and dumb enough to think this guy
cared about me

Her eyes turn glassy Like she can see it all again

AUDREY (CONTD)
I wanted to impress him I was
nervous and I drank too much The
music was so loud There were so
many people It was hot and stuffy
I got nauseous so I asked him
where the bathroom was I remember
tripping on the stairs He caught
me and we laughed at how tipsy I
was I trusted him

(getting more immersed)
When he pushed me on the bed I
didn’t even know where I was at
first The room was spinning When
I told him to stop he said it was
my idea I remember his weight The
pressure I couldn’t move I could
barely breathe I felt like I was
in a coffin But he wouldn’t stop

She pops back to the present glances around

AUDREY (CONTD)

I turned him in to the president
It was his word against mine and he
said it was consensual When I
wouldn’t let it go I was expelled

She pauses staring into empty space

AUDREY (CONTD)
I just left I just gave up I
thought my life was over

Tears well in Audrey’s eyes as they fix on Cheyenne

AUDREY (CONTD)

And then the day came when I saw
her They put her in my arms and it
was like she was magical or

something
(MORE)

AUDREY (CONTD)
She was so small and frail and she
needed me to take care of her

She looks up at Rainy teary-eyed

AUDREY (CONTD)
So I carried on The days went by
and things got a little easier
Then one day I realized she
saved my life

Audrey turns sadly to Cheyenne This is the big one It’s
scary but it’s time to confess the whole story

AUDREY (CONTD)
Thomas the man you know as your
father was my first husband The
truth is the reason he doesn’t pay
child support is because he doesn’t
have to After we divorced he
asked if he could still see you and
I said yes He helped us for a
while but after he remarried he
he quit

Finally the floodgates give way and Audrey breaks down

AUDREY (CONTD)
He’s a good man And I am so sorry
I lied to you Your real father
doesn’t want anything to do with
you I was too scared to tell you
the truth Because I’m a coward

Cheyenne’s eyes reach out with the kind of forgiveness only a
child can offer so quickly

CHEYENNE
Youre not a coward Mom I forgive
you

Rainy sneers He’s had enough

RAINY
Well didn’t this all just turn
into family time But it doesn’t
change a thing David has already
agreed to go the Jesus route

AUDREY
No one agreed to anything

DAVID (0S)
Audrey

She looks at David He’s filled with a calmness

DAVID (CONTD)
It’s okay

Cheyenne manages to get her hands free She looks toward
the gun sitting on the table

Rainy raises the barrel toward David braces the stock
against his shoulder once again

RAINY
Yeah see He wants to do it

Then Cheyenne jumps from the couch grabs the gun It’s so
big comparatively she can hardly hold it up Audrey’s eyes
widen in horror

Rainy grins

RAINY (CONTD)
Do you even know how to use that
thing shy one

BANG Cheyenne wildly fires toward the ceiling the kick
knocking her down Pieces of ceiling fall on Rainy

RAINY (CONT’D)
Shit

While Rainy is distracted Audrey leaps from the couch and
rushes at him screaming Shoulders him with all her might
They both trip over David’s legs and

LIVING ROOM - DAY 48

They slam onto the floor The rifle slides near a buffet
table Rainy grabs Audrey and pulls her down She kicks him
repeatedly The kicks are ineffective and Rainy laughs

RAINY
Oh darlin’ stop it You’re
turnin’ me on

FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 49
Cheyenne climbs to her feet lugging the gun David waves her

over with a nod She hurries to him He holds out his binds
Cheyenne furiously tugs at them

Blue (mmddyyyy) 79

LIVING ROOM - DAY 50

Rainy climbs on top of Audrey still laughing Audrey is
fighting so hard it’s about all he can handle

RAINY
I love a woman who can wrestle

This goes on until David raises the gun barrel to Rainy’s
temple ropes still hanging off his wrist

DAVID
Get off her

Everything stops Rainy stares at David It’s quiet for
several moments Then

From outside TIRES CRUNCH ACROSS GRAVEL A car stops in
back A CAR DOOR OPENS CLOSES

Everyone stays still and quiet After a few moments we hear
the BACK DOOR OPEN FOOTSTEPS

INT FAMILY ROOMKITCHENLIVING ROOM - DAY 51

Bobby enters carrying a satchel The first thing he notices
is Cheyenne He looks at her shocked

BOBBY
Who the fuck are you

CHEYENNE
Cheyenne

Bobby notices David sitting in the doorway to the living room
with his leg bleeding

BOBBY
Who the fuck are you

DAVID
David

Bobby sees Jawari lying dead on the floor

BOBBY
What the hell is going on here

He steps so that he can see into the living room He sees
Rainy on top of Audrey on the floor He sees that David is
pointing a gun at Rainy
Rainy

Blue (mmddyyyy)

BOBBY (CONTD)

79A

RAINY
Uh we had some issues

BOBBY
What the goddamn hell is going on
here What happened to Jawari

RAINY
We got into it and I accidentally
killed him

AUDREY
That’s not true

RAINY
Shut up Audrey You don’t know
what the hell you’re talking about

BOBBY
Where’s the old man

RAINY
He’s dead

Bobby angrily throws his hands in the air
BOBBY
Goddamn it I told you not to kill
the old man

RAINY
He was already dead

BOBBY
Well where is he

AUDREY
He died four days ago

RAINY
The will doesn’t get read ‘til next
week

Bobby stares slack-jawed a moment Glances at David

BOBBY
Why is this asshole pointing a gun
at you

RAINY

He got it while I was wrestling
with Audrey She’s probably gonna
get the water rights next week

Bobby reaches into his satchel

BOBBY
Then she can go ahead and sign

He whips out his pistol points it at David

BOBBY (CONT’D)
First you can put that gun down

David starts to set the gun down on the living room side

BOBBY (CONT’D)
On the other side Over here

David sets the gun down on the family roomkitchen side

BOBBY (CONTD)
Slide it away

David shoves the gun It slides to a stop a few feet away
near the door

BOBBY (CONT’D)
(to Rainy)
Get your gun

Rainy grimaces

RAINY
It’s a rifle

BOBBY
I don’t give a good goddamn if it’s
Jawaris dick pick it up

Rainy sighs stays on his knees and leans across the floor to
grab the rifle

BOBBY (CONTD)
Untie her

Rainy unties Audrey Bobby puts his pistol back into his
satchel and pulls out a contract Rainy hands it to Audrey
Bobby holds out a pen

BOBBY (CONTD)
Sign it

Rainy hands Audrey the pen She doesn’t even try to read the
contract she just signs it Rainy hands the items back to
Bobby He stuffs them into his satchel Lowers the satchel by
David who eyes it intently

BOBBY (CONTD)
Now what you may not realize is
that wills are retroactive It
doesn’t matter when it’s read The
date of ownership of bequeathed
items legally begins the moment the
decedent dies

Bobby looks at Rainy with eyes of cold stone

BOBBY (CONTD)
I’m going to leave now so you can
clean up

AUDREY
We were promised we’d be let go

He scans between the two rooms glancing at Jawari

BOBBY
I wanted things to stay simple but
as you’ve seen Rainy is somewhat
of a loose cannon I think it’s
best at this point to just clean up
and go home

Then David grabs Bobby’s satchel pulls him into the
living room Bobby trips over David’s legs falls on top of
Rainy

Audrey climbs to her feet and jumps over David grabbing
Cheyenne and pulling her along As Audrey opens the door
Cheyenne snatches the gun off the floor

Rainy gets to his feet rifle in hand

BOBBY

Rainy jumps over David As he does David grabs his ankle and
trips him Rainy hits the floor scrambles to his feet He
starts to kick David

BOBBY (CONTD)
Go on I’l1l take care of him

Bobby kicks David in his injured knee David screams in
agony Rainy scuttles out the door

EXT FARMHOUSE - GROUNDS - DAY 52

Rainy bursts out the door in time to see Audrey and Cheyenne
running away He aims his rifle

Audrey and Cheyenne barely make it behind the tree that Rainy
peed on earlier before BANG A bullet smacks a patch of
bark off the trunk Rainy laughs

RAINY
Fuckin’ tree

BANG BANG BANG BANG He fires round after round as he
closes in

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREE

Audrey back to the trunk holds Cheyenne tightly to her
while bullets riddle the tree BANG BANG BANG Pieces of
bark explode on both sides

Then silence Audrey listens Starts to peek when
Rainy’s face pops up

RAINY (CONT’D)
Boo

Audrey flinches screams quickly tucks Cheyenne behind her
RAINY (CONTD)
I’m gonna miss you Audrey This is
the most excitement I’ve had since
my daddy tried to drown me
BEHIND AUDREY

While Rainy talks Cheyenne slips the handle of the gun into
Audrey’s hand

RAINY (CONTD)
Well that and killin’ my ex
girlfriend

AUDREY
And her lover

Rainy grins

RAINY
And her lover

He raises the rifle calls to the house

RAINY (CONT’D)
I got ‘em

While he’s distracted Audrey whips the gun around and points
it at him Rainy does a double-take

AUDREY
I’ve got a gun too

RAINY
Audrey Audrey Audrey I’m
disappointed in you This is a
rifle

AUDREY
I’m sorry You have a rifle And I
have a gun

RAINY

Thank you But what you don’t

have is the balls
He starts to make a move It’s cut short
BANG A bullet streaks by Rainy’s ear leaving a trail of
blood across the side of his head Audrey screams taken off
guard by the recoil Rainy yells as he’s thrown back He hits
the ground with a thud

AUDREY
Come on

She starts to run Cheyenne grabs the barrel of Rainy’s
rifle jerks her hand back when it burns

CHEYENNE
It’s hot

Audrey grabs her

AUDREY
Let’s go

They head for the barn Rainy grabs the side of his head

RAINY
Audrey you bitch

Rainy stumbles to his feet Starts for the barn Notices the
tree Angrily kicks it

RAINY (CONTD)
Fuckin’ tree

He turns and staggers toward the barn

INT BARN - MOMENTS LATER 53

The door creaks open Rainy peeks in cautiously Steps in
just as cautiously scanning the area

RAINY
I’m impressed Audrey I misjudged
you That doesn’t happen often

He steps further in looking around assessing There’s a
loft above on one side long abandoned livestock stalls on
the other A door out the back

RAINY (CONTD)
I forgot I was dealing with a high
school valedictorian

He snickers to himself

RAINY (CONTD)
You got guts Audrey And you’re
smart And that’s a dangerous
combination

He turns certain she’ll give herself away

RAINY (CONTD)
I know you’re in here

EXT BARN’S BACK DOOR - DAY 54

Audrey waits by the side of the door with a shovel in her
hands Breathing heavily trying to keep as quiet as she can
The gun is tucked into her pants

RAINY (0S)
You could have killed me But you
couldn’t bring yourself to do it

INT BARN —- DAY 55
Rainy nears the back door He trains his rifle on the loft
RAINY
You don’t have the kind of guts it

takes to kill a man It’s the eyes
Something about the eyes

BANG He fires a round into the loft It blasts a chunk of
the old wood into dust tearing a hole through the floor

EXT BARN’S BACK DOOR - DAY 56

Audrey flinches at the sound

RAINY (0S)
I sure hope shy one wasn’t in that
loft
INT BARN - DAY 57

BANG BANG BANG Several holes are blasted into the loft
Rainy turns toward the back door

RAINY
Where did you go Audrey Did you
go off into the woods

He starts to step through the doorway

RAINY (CONTD)
It’s scary out in the woods --

Suddenly the back of a shovel flies right toward his face

PING It smacks him square in the nose knocking his head
back He falters hits the dirt Audrey screams charging in
with the shovel over her head She levels it like an axe
splitting wood Rainy puts his arms up to shield himself

CRACK Right across his forearm Rainy yells He tries to aim
his rifle while Audrey draws back again Just as he aims
Audrey screams swings like a baseball bat
WHACK Knocks the rifle out of his hand and into a stall
Rainy manages to grab the shovel’s handle near the scoop
Audrey tries to pull it back Rainy laughs
RAINY (CONTD)
I’m gonna bury you with this
shovel

Audrey abandons the shovel runs out the back door

EXT BARN’S BACK DOOR - MOMENTS LATER 59
Rainy totters out the door with his rifle He sniffles from
his possibly broken nose and grunts from his busted forearm
Not to mention the blood across his temple from the bullet

EXT FARMHOUSE GROUNDS - DAY 60

Rainy staggers into the open near the woodpile Bobby hangs
out a window in the living room

INT FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY 62
Bobby pulls back into the house
BOBBY
I’m tired of all this messing

around

He sits on the buffet David sits in the doorway Sweat beads
on his face and his breathing has become erratic

DAVID
I can’t believe you’re going to
kill a mother and her little girl
BOBBY
Yeah well you’re next if that
helps you forget

He chuckles David turns away Notices something

FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 63

By Jawari’s body The switchblade

LIVING ROOM - DAY 64

David looks back at Bobby Bobby pulls out a cell phone
Glances at his watch

BOBBY
I wonder if I still have time to
file today with the Water Resources
Department

He pauses looking at David
BOBBY (CONTD)
The kid was probably just going to

be another nobody anyway

Bobby starts dialing David looks at the switchblade again
Can he sneak to it before Bobby notices

BOBBY (CONT’D)
(phone)
Yeah how late are you open

He climbs off the buffet leaving his satchel behind

BOBBY (CONT’D)
How long does it take to process a
transferral of water rights

He turns his back absentmindedly David sees his chance

FAMILY ROOMKITCHEN - DAY 65
David crawls across the floor toward Jawari
BOBBY (0S)
Oh really So there’s really no way
I could make it today

David grits his teeth fighting the pain Trying to do this
as stealthily as he can
BOBBY (0S) (CONTD)
So if I get there first thing
tomorrow morning I could have the
rights in my company name before
the day is out
David is almost there Then he notices eerie silence He
pauses Looks back at the doorway Nothing What is Bobby
doing David waits Waits Then
BOBBY (0S) (CONTD)
That’s great I can be there by
nine Can I get your name

The conversation is winding up David hurries

LIVING ROOM - DAY 66
Bobby turns around as he speaks

BOBBY
Thank you Karen I’1ll see you --

He stops cold when he sees the empty doorway

BOBBY (CONT’D)
Tomorrow Bye

He shuts the phone off eyes blazing Rushes to the doorway

FAMILY ROOM KITCHEN - DAY 67

David is at the front door reaching for the knob

BOBBY
Trying to escape What’s the matter
with you

Bobby kicks him David grunts slides down onto the floor
BOBBY (CONTD)
I can’t believe you thought you
could crawl away
Bobby kicks him again David groans doubling over
BOBBY (CONTD)
I should have shot you right from
the get-go

He grabs David Turns him over to pull him up

DAVID
Go to hell

David stabs Bobby in the leg with the switchblade Bobby
screams as he falls back onto the floor with the knife still
stuck in his leg

BOBBY
You son of a bitch

David crawls toward the doorway to the living room It takes
all his strength but he desperately forces himself

Bobby grabs the knife handle Screams as he pulls the blade
out Struggles to climb to his feet

David passes the threshold Bobby lurches after
BOBBY (CONT’D)
You should have slashed my throat
LIVING ROOM - DAY 68

David reaches the middle of the floor when Bobby limps in
with the switchblade

BOBBY
You made the same mistake I did

David climbs up the buffet Reaches for the satchel Just as
he touches it

Bobby stabs him right in the back David cries out Falls
back to the floor The satchel drops beside him Some papers
slip out The pistol slides out on top of them

Bobby draws back and stabs David in the back again And
again And again Until

KINK The blade breaks off Bobby sees the broken metal
angrily tosses the handle away He grabs the pistol Uses the
buffet to pull himself to his feet

BOBBY (CONTD)
I bet you wish you’d killed me from
the start now don’t you

David strains to turn himself over Looks up at Bobby
quivering He’s about to die and he knows it

DAVID
I don’t have any more regrets

He relents and succumbs

EXT WOODS - DAY 69

Audrey and Cheyenne hike through overgrowth Climb down into
a large shallow pit grown over with grass In the middle
Audrey stops Looks around confused

AUDREY
Wait a minute

Cheyenne stops Watches her mother

AUDREY (CONTD)
I remember this This is the
reservoir Or it was

She glances around again double-checking

AUDREY (CONTD)
The reservoir was right here I’m
sure of it

CHEYENNE
What happened to it

AUDREY
I don’t know

She scans ahead Points

AUDREY (CONTD)
If I remember right the creek must
be right over there somewhere

IN ANOTHER AREA 70

Rainy trudges along searching He pauses noticing
something A leaf about the level of his head

He steps closer Takes the leaf into his hand and sees
blood He feels his temple The blood is his own He smacks
the leaf aside in frustration

RAINY
Fucking circles

He looks down a pathway The depth of field contracts The
trees appear to close in Rainy shakes it off Looks another
direction The trees close in that direction too

He looks another direction Same thing Then another Once
again the trees are closing in He calls out

RAINY (CONTD)
Audrey
AUDREY 71
Whirls hearing him She turns to Cheyenne
AUDREY
He’s gotten farther away He must
be going the wrong way Let’s go

They head into a long stretch of woods angled downward

RAINY 72
Runs through the forest like a madman He trips over a root
sticking out Smacks the ground He raises his face then
pauses hearing something The gentle WHOOSH of water

RAINY
The creek

He climbs to his feet moves its direction

AUDREY 73

Reaches the edge of the creek followed by Cheyenne They’re
about twenty feet up and it’s a steep drop on both sides

CHEYENNE
Should we go downstream Maybe the
water isn’t as deep

Audrey studies the drop covered with thick exposed roots

AUDREY
No I think the roots will hold

She climbs down stepping on roots like crooked ladder rungs
Audrey pauses when she’s completely over the side

AUDREY (CONTD)
Okay Cheyenne Be very careful
I’1l be right below you

Cheyenne balks extremely nervous

CHEYENNE
I’m scared

AUDREY

I know you are sweetie but we’ll
be down before you know it

RAINY 74

Forces his way through small branches Emerges at a large
creek bed Smiles

It’s much lower than where Audrey and Cheyenne are but the
bed covers a larger area Rainy’s footsteps sink in the soft
bed as he approaches the creek
Rainy drops to his knees at the bank The creek flows
peacefully Rainy splashes water on his face upsetting the
tranquility
AUDREY 75
Keeps one hand free to catch Cheyenne
AUDREY

Make sure you have your footing

before you take your next step
Cheyenne reluctantly places her foot on a root It slips off
She screams

RAINY 76

Raises his face looking upstream Grins Grabs his rifle
Splashes across the creek to the other side

AUDREY 77
Clutches Cheyenne

AUDREY
It’s okay I’ve got you

Cheyenne holds onto her mother paralyzed with fear

AUDREY (CONTD)
Climb onto my back

Cheyenne hesitates Tries to pull herself together
AUDREY (CONTD)
Come on Cheyenne We don’t have

time You can do it

Cheyenne shakily climbs onto Audrey’s back Audrey navigates
the roots struggling with the additional weight

They finally reach the very narrow creek bed The creek on
the other hand is wide and the water is rushing Audrey
sets Cheyenne down Surmises

CHEYENNE
Are we going to cross it

AUDREY
I don’t think we have a choice

Audrey climbs down into the water It’s nearly waist deep

AUDREY (CONTD)
Climb on

Cheyenne climbs onto Audrey’s back and Audrey wades across

RAINY 78
Follows the creek on the other side The whoosh of water is
faster now He treks uphill

AUDREY 79
Is right at the bank One more step and she’ll be there She
loses her footing and falls forward Cheyenne catches the

edge of the bank while Audrey goes under

CHEYENNE
Mom

Cheyenne’s face fills with panic She pulls herself onto the
narrow bank

CHEYENNE (CONT’D)
Mom

Audrey breaks the surface gasping Reaching for the bank

CHEYENNE (CONT’D)
Mom

Cheyenne looks back and sees a root She grabs it with one
hand Reaches for Audrey’s hand with the other

Smack Their hands clasp Cheyenne pulls with all her might
Audrey claws at the bank With Cheyenne’s help Audrey
manages to pull herself to the bank

She climbs out of the water Rests on the bank Struggles to
catch her breath

CHEYENNE (CONT’D)
What happened

AUDREY
An undercurrent caught my foot

Cheyenne looks at her mother shaken by the whole thing

CHEYENNE
Are you okay

Audrey nods still catching her breath

AUDREY
Thanks

CHEYENNE
All we got is each other

Audrey smiles with tears of pride welling in her eyes

AUDREY
That’s plenty Let’s go

They pull themselves to their feet There’s another “root
ladder” going up the other side

CHEYENNE
I think I can do it myself this
time

AUDREY
You sure
(off her nod)
Okay then go on I’1ll be right
behind you

Cheyenne starts climbing up the roots

BANKWOODS - MOMENTS LATER 80
Just as Cheyenne is about to reach the top

A rifle lowers into her face Her eyes widen Audrey
realizing Cheyenne has stopped looks up to see Rainy

RAINY
What do we have here This is a
regular reunion Speaking of you
must have had your first high
school reunion by now

AUDREY
I didn’t go

Rainy shakes his head

RAINY
Well that’s a shame And you were
valedictorian I would have thought
you would have felt obligated to
attend

AUDREY
I couldn’t get the night off

RAINY
Waitress duty called eh

AUDREY
I would appreciate it if you would
stop pointing that gun in my
daughter’s face

Rainy smirks
RAINY
Audrey how many times do I have to

tell you It’s a goddamn rifle

He braces the stock against his shoulder Desperate Audrey
looks toward Cheyenne

AUDREY
Cheyenne It’s not hot right now

Cheyenne’s eyes move to the rifle barrel Rainy smiles
playfully oblivious

RAINY
Yes it is rather nice out here by
the creek isn’t it

AUDREY
(to Cheyenne)
Push it up

CHEYENNE
When

Rainy gets suspicious

RAINY
What are you two talking about

AUDREY
Now

Cheyenne grabs the rifle barrel shoves it upward From
behind Audrey reaches over and points her gun at Rainy His
eyes widen

AUDREY (CONTD)
This is your last warning shot
motherfucker

BANG Rainy grunts Looks down A bloodstain on his shirt
over his chest grows with the pump of his heart He looks at
Audrey in disbelief

Cheyenne pulls the rifle from his limp hand It clangs down
the drop and splashes into the creek

Rainy stands Looks at his own blood on his trembling hands
Struggles to speak

RAINY
If it hadn’t been for that
fuckin’ tree

He falls over the edge Tumbles down the drop and splashes
into the water

Cheyenne and Audrey climb up into the woods by the drop
Audrey gazes down stunned by her own actions After a few
moments she realizes something

AUDREY
Okay step back
She motions for Cheyenne to clear some room

CHEYENNE
What are you going to do

Audrey raises the barrel into the air
AUDREY
There needs to be two shots

GRANDFATHER
I always liked her If I remember

Grandfathers face takes on a chilling tone

GRANDFATHER
Don’t talk to me that way

Bobby turns immediately submissive

BOBBY

GRANDFATHER
I’1l smack your nose around to the
other side of your head

BOBBY
I’m sorry okay I didn’t mean it

BOBBY
I’m sorry You wanted the phone to
call the police

Bobby starts to reach in Audrey raises her gun higher

AUDREY
Don’t

Bobby stops frowns He steps into the open as Audrey steps
further in

BOBBY

Hey now I didn’t kill anybody
All I wanted was for you to sign
the papers All I wanted was the
water rights I just told those

guys to get the old man to sign
When they found out he was dead
they should have left I didn’t

know what they were gonna do

Audrey fixes the gun on Bobby He stares down the barrel
visibly shaken Audrey’s aim is steady Her face is sure

AUDREY
I want you to reach in slowly If
you want to live take out the
phone If you want to die take

out the gun

Bobby vacillates Then he reaches into the satchel so slow
it seems like forever He nervously clutches something

Audrey watches wearing a poker face
BOBBY
Well I’ve already got the
signature So I guess there’s no
sense in any more violence

He raises the satchel with his hand still in it

BANG Blood spatters as a bullet rips through his chest He
groans wildly raising the satchel into the air

BANG He fires a round blowing out the side of the satchel
and into the ceiling Pieces of ceiling rain down on him

We follow him as he falls back in SLOW MOTION his face

filled with disbelief All the way until he hits the floor
with a RESOUNDING THUMP Dead

PENDLETON’S OFFICE - DAY 86

SUPER “One Week Later”

Mr Pendleton sits at his desk and reads from a file

He closes

MR PENDLETON
And so this concludes his last will
and testament The house is
officially yours

the folder

MR PENDLETON (CONT’D)
I’m not sure if you’1ll want to live
in it now or not given all that’s
happened But it’s yours to do with
as you please Are there any
questions

Audrey and Cheyenne dressed nicely sit across from him

Audrey is

AUDREY
I didn’t hear you mention anything
about the water rights

MR PENDLETON
Water rights Your grandfather got
his water from the district

confused This is news to her

AUDREY
But I thought Grandpa’s water was
gravity fed from a creek I
remember playing around the
reservoir when I was a kid

MR PENDLETON
Yes when you were a child maybe
But he switched to district water
over twenty years ago He was too
old to maintain the pipes

AUDREY
Then who owns the water rights

MR PENDLETON
The state The law is that if water
rights aren’t exercised for five
years or more they go into
forfeiture

AUDREY
Did Grandpa know this

MR PENDLETON
I don’t know He would have been
nearly eighty when it went into
forfeiture It’s entirely possible
he couldn’t read or understand the
notices

AUDREY

I don’t think he did So Grandpa
couldn’t have sold the water rights
even if he wanted to

MR PENDLETON
He could have gotten them from the
state Anyone could

AUDREY
You mean those rights were up for
grabs for anyone who wanted them

MR PENDLETON
Yes anyone

Audrey stares completely flabbergasted She can’t process
it Mr Pendleton becomes concerned

MR PENDLETON (CONT’D)
Are you okay

She doesn’t answer She just stares distant

MR PENDLETON (CONT’D)
Audrey

Finally Audrey breaks down She buries her face in her hands
and cries It upsets Cheyenne

CHEYENNE
What’s wrong

MR PENDLETON
It’ll be all right You can sell
off some of the trees to the
sawmill That should get you by

CHEYENNE
Don’t cry Mom

As Audreys “crying” progresses it becomes more and more
evident that she’s not crying at all She’s laughing

AUDREY
I’m not crying sweetie

She raises her face She’s on the verge of crying but
laughing nonetheless

CHEYENNE
What’s so funny

AUDREY
All they had to do was ask

She keeps laughing and fighting back tears

AUDREY (CONTD)
All they had to do was ask

FADE OUT
