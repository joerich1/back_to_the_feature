FADE IN

DARKNESS

A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO -

MONTAGE of fast moving clips Death destruction fear All images
taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths

AGAIN DARKNESS
OPEN ON

The year is 2455 The place is Old Earth Barren void of life a
hazardous and violent planet The sky is blood red with spiked clouds

dark gray It is beautiful but frighteningly foreign

BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM
below

Small groups of people wearing thick dusters goggles and masks work
nearby Some dig in the cracked earth others take assorted readings
with strange devices
This is an archeological expedition

CUT TO
INT DARK PLACE
The dust storm rages outside Two figures are looking closely at a

object buried in the dirt One of them pulls a device out of their

and slowly gently picks up the object The other uses a magnetic tool
to remove the dirt

FEMALE VOICE
Careful

MALE VOICE
I know

They take off their masks and goggles They are both young ADRIENNE
female watches as STONEY male studies the object closely

STONEY
(reading)

Not guaranteed if used After 2198

CLOSE UP of the object Its an unopened condom
raging

cover

scarred

ADRIENNE
(smiles)
You thinking what Im thinking

Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open
the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off

PULL BACK TO REVEAL
They are in a half buried mini-van It rocks violently from the
storm outside and from the raging lust inside
BACK INSIDE THE VAN
ADRIENNE
(breathless)
What about Kkinsa
STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra
STONEY
Its over between us Youre the
only one for me
METAL SCREECHES THE FLOOR COLLAPSES
They fall some ten feet RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them
INT DARK CORRIDOR
A rusty metal ladder Debris everywhere Half inch layers of dust

everything Dead Lifeless

STONEY
You okay

Adrienne sits up shines her light down the long metal corridor She
turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder

SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM

We PULL BACK out of the tunnel through the van as the sounds of the
storm drown out ADRIENNES SCREAM

CUT TO
EXT BASE CAMP

The digging and readings have stopped A group approaches a time
shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly

FAT LOU rail thin possible female pilot appears at the top of
the shuttle ramp
FAT LOU

KICKER bulky short on temper rushes up wearing futuristic
military garb -

KICKER
Yo Teach what the fuck

YLLO

KICKER moves past the group and into the Van

YLLO
Not without me

The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van
INT ANCIENT CORRIDOR
YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder Metallic walls

graffiti cluttered floors No Stoney or Adrienne A sign from the
ceiling states -
CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY

They all take off the goggles and masks The rest of the group
consists

of DELONGPRE good looking smart ass JANESSA sexual scheming

AZRAEL SMALL COCKY KKINSA insecure problematic

THORGAN a nerd but doesnt know it

YLLO
Amazing But how Ive been coming
here for ten years We never picked this up on
our KAY-EM

KAY-EM 14 a cybernetics science droid removes her veil Shes
gorgeous but theres something off about her look Something
synthetic

KAY-EM 14
The airs laced with type two ozone
it reads as a solid

THORGAN
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden

KAY-EM 14
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved
their facilities underground to escape

KICKER
All right all right enough with the history
lesson Lets find these two quick so I can kick

some little punk ass
Kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel
KKINSA
I have an idea why dont you go find
them and well get the hell out of here

KKINSA turns and finds herself face to face with - -

A CORPSE Easily two-hundred years old it hangs from the wall impaled
through the forehead by an iron spike

KKINSA SCREAMS
Kicker yanks a weapon from his back locks and loads as

JANESSA falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse She
screams

KAY-EM 14 SCREAMS at the top of her lungs Everyone looks at the
droid

KAY-EM 14
Was that out loud

THORGAN grabs the head off the CORPSE

Azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground
and an ancient box of PLAYTEX starts shoving the corpse

cds

DELONGPREE
Thorgan have you been screwing with

THORGAN
Cool This is an automatic A

his pack

Yllos light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling

AZRAEL

YLLO
Relax Soldier boy this is amazing
These remains are two hundred years old

BOEMAN

THORGAN

KKINSA

Okay Im outta here

YYLO

KAY-EM 14
Girth is better than length and
women prefer a shaved scrotum during
oral sex

Yllo glares a Thorgan

THORGAN
Im trying to give her some personality

YLLO
Well stop messing with her I dont want
a science droid with a personality Now
lets find them and get back I want to

(calls out)
Adrienne Stoney

Yllo rushes past the corpse The others reluctantly follow They pass
another hanging sign - Danger - THEY PASS ANOTHER CORPSE LYING ON THE
FLOOR its torso separated from its legs And this is just the

beginning As they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere

BOEMAN
There was a hall of a battle down here

S they move further they break a laser beam sparks fly A
VOICE sounds

COMPUTER VOICE
Dan-danger Do not enter-er

But the group keeps moving
KKINSA
I feel compelled to ask why we are

ignoring that

A corpse lies on the floor before them its skeletal hand beneath a
warning written in ancient blood

HELP ME

Suddenly another CORPSE LEAPS at them screaming like a banshee
Everyone SCREAMS - It lands on Kkinsa who totally freaks trying to

the corpse off her

DELONGPREE and YLLO help Kkinsa fight the rotting corpse They hear
hysterical laughter and look up to see -

ADRIENNE and STONEY emerge from the shadows laughing
uncontrollably
DELONGPREE
Damnit
YLLO

What the hell are you two doing
Kkinsa eyes Adrienne then glares at Stoney

KKINSA
Youre toast mister

YLLO
Youre both toast

ADRIENNE
You gotta see this

They turn down the right corridor passing beneath ceiling consisting
of
a jumbled mess of jagged metal
THORGAN
(re ceiling)

Thats a strange design dont you think

KICKER
We dont have time for this shit

As they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and
squeeze together That cant be a good thing

STONEY and Adrienne stop at a huge metal door Above the door
CRYOGENICS LAB

Adrienne points to a small window in the door

DELONGPREE
Yeah so I had Cryo 101 last year

ADRIENNE
Check it out

With a smirk Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in
the door Drawn from the inside in blood is a final warning -

A SKULL AND CROSSBONES

KKINSA
So dont open the door

ADRIENNE
Look beyond it yesterdays news

Yllo pushes his way to the window

Shocked faces

INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder Its
massive but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room Curled

up into a ball is a body - female young

YLLO
Is that

KAY-EM 14
The rooms still operational
Shes perfectly preserved

Yllos face lights up grabs his radio

YLLO
(into radio)
Fat Lou bring the ship to the
following coordinates Call Grendel
have them power up the labs were bringing
in the find of the century

KICKER
Now wait a minute I dont think you
should open that door

YLLO
This is a science excursion corporal
Just stay out of the way

Yllo turns to the kids Hes very excited

YLLO
Okay no screwing around This is the real
thing Do exactly what I say Okay Thorgan
open it up

Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small
gadget

KKINSA
Youre opening the door
What about the

She points to the skull and crossbones

DELONGPREE
Im thinking we should call in some
experts

YLLO

This is your find people You want to
give your credit away

DELONGPREE
I was just saying

THORGAN

Hold your breath Initial cryo gasses
will render you unconcious

DELONGPREE
Knock you on your ass pal

They don their face masks as Fshhhhhshshsh The metallic door
cracks open causing a powerful backdraft The freezing cold air mixes
with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas Ice
crystals crack and fall to the floor

CLOSE ON KAY-EMS EYES

They are not human Mechanical digital but alluring They dilate

up Colored lasers shoot forth slicing through the gas scanning the
body

Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack clicks a button and
flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground
Kicker grabs Yllo

KICKER

Yllo pulls away leans over the frozen girl grabs the frozen string
blood and -CRACK-breaks it off
YLLO

Fine grab that end
Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled
body on the stretcher
ANOTHER ANGLE
As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit -

THORGAN
Hey check this out

Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete
THORGAN
This caused the leak and theres an
occupant

Thorgan yanks the door open

KICKER
Dont touch that
Gas rolls out Suddenly ALARMS SOUND and LIGHTS STROBE

KKINSA
This is bad no

THORGAN
Relax its only a glitch in the
system

JANESSA

First field trip and you think

way geek

JANESSA moves to look inside the chamber

As the gas and steam clear - we hear the sound of CRACKING ICE see a

jagged mass of frozen crystals and within it a body A
chunk

of ice CRACKS and falls tot he floor then THE MASK of JASON VOORHEES

looms forward

JANESSA screams as JASONS BODY stiff as a board CRASHES to the
ground

sending ice shrapnel everywhere
DELONGPREE
Jesus used to make the suckers big
didnt they

Again Kay-Ems eyes scan the frozen body

KAY-EM 14
Subject was dead prior to incubation

Yllo moves to get a good look at Jason
YLLO
My God look at him Why would they freeze
a dead body
(a beat)
Alright load him up and lets get out
of here

OVER HIS SHOULDER - HALL

A pair of three foot metallic spiders drop on thin wires to the floor
BACK INSIDE

One of Boemans gadgets starts to BEEP

BOEMAN

ADRIENNE
Oh Gawd I wish it would stop doing that

At her feet Azraels arm twitches spastically

AZRAEL

That is soooo cool

Kicker cracks the door and tosses his gadget

Stonet leaps grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very
acrobatic move

Boeman kneels cups his hands to make a step He begins tossing his
friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall

Soon Boeman and Kicker are the only two left

BOEMAN
Were clear Lets go

Boeman leaps up grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety
He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker

Kicker leaps grabs Boemans hand Boeman strains to pull him up as
spiders cover the floor below them then -

A spider crawls up Kickers leg - a spike shoots out into Kickers
thigh He screams

KICKER

YLLO
I am a scientist you asshole This could be
the most important discovery in 400 years Do
you have any idea what a find like this could
mean

BRODSKI
Right now I care only for the safety of this
crew You dont know anything about these two -

The stretcher with JASON moves by them Brodski looks down

BRODSKI
Jesus what the hell is that

YLLO
Thats exactly what we need to find out
Check your orders Sergeant I out rank you

Janessa readies a hypo

THORGAN
Maybe if we knew a little bit more about

Janessa moves behind Rizzo with the sedative Suddenly Rizzo throws
her
head back Salmming it into Yllos nose He CRIES OUT in pain

Janessa lunges with the syringe but Rizzo snatches her wrist grabbing
the hypo burying it into Janessas left breast

RIZZO
tNighty-night

Janessa collapses Yllo rushes Rizzo again but this time Boeman
stands blocks his path

towards
Jason and Delongpre then aims a little high

Jasons head

He collapses The surrounded faces look happily suprised

his arms

around his neck

What are you doing You cant save him

Delongpre smashes the back of Jasons knee with the chaingun
Jason topples on top of Boeman Crutch is thrown free

Janessa and Thorgan help Crutch to his feet as Jason sees Rizzo for
first time in 400 hundred years

Its either love at first sight or one hell of a grudge He leaps to
feet and races towards her

on the slab
The machine quickly goes to work

A schematic of his arm appears on the wall
Janessa stares at him

JANESSA
Whats the point

Delongpre shrugs

DELONGPRE
So thats it then

It seems it is

Janessa stands over Yllos decapitated body Its obvious their

relationship
went beyond just teacherstudent There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from

RIZZO
Whats that

THats the sound of deep space attacking the

Thats the sound of the men working
on the chain gang

Are there any other shuttles

JANESSA
No

Hey

Thats a good fantasy though
Kinky but good

RIZZO
Hey

All heads turn to Rizzo Shes staring at a schematic of the ship The
left hull

of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the
various

system failures Rizzo points to the right hull

RIZZO
Whats this

DELONGPRE
Its the engine reactors audiometers
its the stuff that makes the ship go zoom

Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls

RIZZO
Can we get through these

THORGAN
Sure but what good will that do

BOEMAN
When the left hull goes so will the
right

RIZZO

What if we blow the walkways first
Leave Jason over here to go up with
the ship

They stare at her
JANESSA
You know Yllo seemed to think we could
catch this guy alive well hed be worth
millions

The others stare at her as if she were crazy

RIZZO
Any connection between your reality and mine
is purely coincidental

JANESSA
Im just saying

RIZZO
(to others)
Come on You got all these gadgets and shit
Why cant we get inside the right hull seal up
the doors and blow the walkways

DELONGPRE
Wed need charges

BOEMAN
We could convert fission transistors

THORGAN
Were not supposed to do that

BOEMAN
What are you gonna do tell me

DELONGPRE
The engine room will have molecular welders
We could seal up the hull

A moment of consideration Could this actually work

INT CARGO BAY

Boeman Janessa Delongpre and Rizzo slowly move through the piles of
debris
Still burning cargo creates a ghastly image of flickering shadows

DELONGPRE
See anything

They move toward the rubble that had buried Jason before
CLOSE on the rubble
There is an obvious hole dug out from the middle

DELONGPRE
I think I speak on behalf of the group

Janessa stops working listens

KA-THUMP -- Theres anoise in the Cargo Bay

She covers the mike on her headset and calls out

JANESSA
Thorgan you little shit is that you

No answer She quickly turns to her pack and pulls out the bottle of
tranquillizer

and a monster syringe She fills this rhino syringe with a massive
dosage Enough to

bring down a Rhinoor Jason maybe

She starts moving down the walkway toward the Cargo Bay
Surely shes not that stupid

INT WALKWAY THREE
Rizzo is staring at Delongpre as he works on another device

Then --

RIZZO
When I was four the ocean quit producing

life Too many pollutants Nuclear testing

the occasional terrorist bombingthe

atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight

We moved underground when I was twelve

Delongpre stares at her He doesnt want to speak and screw up this

rare moment of sharing
INT CARGO BAY

Janessa enters Looks around

The cargo bay is dark and looming Lights flicker

strobe Its hard to make anything out
We hear Rizzo speaking Off Screen

RIZZO(OS)
My father was an army Scientist

develop humans able to survive the Earth
we had created

Janessa moves through the debris

She gives him a half smile
DELONGPRE

Another half smile Its a sweet gesture but what can this guy really

Hoses and wires now encircle Jasons body We follow one of the hoses
until it ends
over --

A WASTE BEND

nside we see pile of bullets Stuff falls from the hose Bullets from
the chaingun

bullets from every previous Jason movie A broken machete blade drops
to the pile

The tip of an arrow A couple of knives A pair of pliers An ink pen
The skeleton

of a fish

The scanning lasers move to the stump at Jasons shoulder We see the
image as a new arm fuzzy
adn distorted is being constructed

On the schematic we see Jasons internal organs being repaired

By now weve figured out nothing good can come of this

Little good itll do

INT REACTOR ROOM CORRIDOR

JASON kicks the door with his metallic leg
KA-FWAM The door shatters and he stumlbes into --
EXT CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE

Forest cabins the lake Everything as we and Jason remember
But somehow distroted A strange hue covers everything

No on second look its not exactly the way we remember The trees
are

strange looking Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut but something

foreign

The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a
camp
But the image will do
QUICK CUT TO

INT REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY

Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away Boeman is wearing a space
suit

Hes helping sergeatn Brodski into his

At the other end of the huge room Jason wanders with confusion

A fat man wearing only a spiked leather Speedo A huge turtle
A couple of goats

Nothing is stopping Jason

Then Rizzo reaches down She grabs Delongpres leg and CLICKS a
button

on her sleeve

KA-CHSSHSH

They laugh and turn to stare toward EARTH II
EXT EARTH II -- ORBIT

Suddenly Jasons body comes into view Its racing toward Earth II
Brodski riding it like Slim Pickens
BRODSKI
Yeee---Haaaaa

Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere

Immediately Brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone He was a good
manstay to the end to make sure the job was done right

Spread eagle and alone facing the planet below Jason continues his
descent

His fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up
It begins to glow His metallic arm and leg glow

Flames build as he rockets towards Earth II

Flesh BUBBLES and OOZES

His legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from
his

body

EXT CAMP SIGHT

Four kids sit on futuristic sleeping bags around an old fashion
campfire

KID 1
Hey Check that out

They look up and see a blaze shooting towards Earth II

KID 2
A falling star

KID 3
Its a meteor dickhead

KID 2
Its still cool

It LIGHTS up the night then --
EXPLODES IN A BRILLIANT FIREWORKS DISPLAY

KID 1
Cool

From the explosion one small smoldering chunk falls toward Earth II
EXT CRYSTAL RESERVOIR

OUR POV

As the chunk falls closer and closer we see that it is a glowing

chrome
hockey mask

IT HITS THE WATER with a SSSSS
BACK TO KIDS

KID 4
Damn It his the reservoir

KID 1

The others agree as they grab their flashlights and head in toward
could be a wonderful new discovery

DISSOLVE INTO
A STREAM

The hockey mask washes down the stream comes to a halt at a pair of
grusomely charred hands

THE FINGERS

TWITCH curl around the mask lifting it off camera AND WE --
FADE OUT a familiar KI-KI-KI-KI-HA-HA-HA-HA resonating as we --
ROLL CREDITS

THE END
