RESUME LEBLANC’S EXTERIOR

The disappointed parents file out past the display window
where a bundle of quirkiness named MUFFIN stands transfixed
on the Robofriend 3000

Muffin is a wide-eyed freckled 8 year-old redhead in a
striped beanie a plaid scarf and paisley leggings

Her eyes are locked with Robofriend’s her tiny breaths
fogging up the window -- She reaches out clears it with her
sleeve and continues gazing at the robot of her dreams

carefully considering my request
(excitedly to Boy 2)
And I think I have a frontrunner

BOY 2
Wow you really are a weirdo

NANCY
Guys that’s not very nice

They continue along the sidewalk Muffin flanks Nancy
MUFFIN
I’m ninety percent sold on the

spreadsheet of pros and cons
As Muffin rambles on Nancy shakes her head smiles

Looks like a typical Midwestern home A sign in the front
reads CEDAR SHOALS FOSTER HOME --

And it’s Tuesday That’s spaghetti night
Just so we’re clear

NANCY

MUFFIN

And it’s a school night so lights out at
830 on the dot

They bustle in after Nancy Boy 1 closes the door in
Muffin’s face locks it He peeks out the window sticks his
tongue out at her

Muffin reaches for the doorbell but decides not to ring it
She turns back to the quiet snowy yard smiles to herself

A BIT LATER

Muffin has made the best of it and is putting the finishing
touches on an immaculate snowman in the yard

Don’t have a pipe for you but smoking’s
been linked to several health problems
anyway That’s what took Frosty out

MUFFIN (CONTD)
So are you gonna stick around or you
just gonna melt like all the others

A COUPLE strolls past the house with a HAPPY DAUGHTER They
hold hands giggling and smiling The perfect little family

Muffin watches them from the stoop a look of sadness washing
over her -- Then to add injury to insult

A SNOWBALL EXPLODES on Muffin’s head -- behind a hedge a
pair of NEIGHBORHOOD BULLIES laugh gather more snow

BULLY 1
Think fast freak

He launches another snowball as Muffin scurries to the door
Bully 2 runs into the yard topples the snowman laughs

Muffin frantically rings the doorbell as more snowballs rain
down -- Finally Nancy opens it The Bullies rush off

NANCY
Muffin it’s time for dinner Why are you

Satan stops pinches his mid-section --

out into the crosswalk --

A passing car SCREECHES on the brakes but it’s too late A
quick YELP The woman SCREAMS jumps back --

EXT PEARLY GATES - MOMENTS LATER

Reggie leaps to his feet as the BEAUTIFUL POODLE walks in
Reggie makes his way to her They touch noses --

INT SATAN’S NEW OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Satan runs his fingers along his gleaming white desk
SATAN
(to Marge)

You knew about this

Marge nods hands Satan a gift box He opens it His ‘1
SATAN’ MUG glistens inside He sets the mug on the desk

SATAN (CONTD)
Thanks for believing in me

Satan hugs her kisses her on the cheek She blushes --

GOD
This was all part of my plan Satan

Off of Satan’s confusion --

GOD (CONTD)
(takes a deep breath)

If you had never spawned that tornado
Muffin might have never ended up in the
foster home She may never have written
to Santa And If you hadn’t invented
dyslexia six-thousand years ago the
letter would have never come to you

SATAN
I gave her dyslexia too

GOD
Mild case Just enough to get that letter
to you

Satan shakes his head glumly --

GOD (CONTD)

Relax she wins the Pulitzer for
literature two decades from now The
point is you wouldn’t be sitting here
now if you weren’t who you were then

Satan nods knowingly

SATAN
I guess sometimes you need the clouds in
order to see the silver lining

God extends a hand Satan shakes it -- The HEAD ANGEL from
air traffic control approaches God --

ANGEL
Excuse me Your Awesomeness there’s a
situation at the Times Square New Years
celebration

God and Satan share a knowing look

SATAN
Beelzebuth

ANGEL
The crowd was counting down but with two
seconds left the giant ball turned into
Pacman and started chasing the Mayor

SATAN

(winces )
Gotta give him points for originality

GOD
Looks like we’ll have our hands full
Better get to Angel-ing big guy
God starts away Satan stops him --
SATAN
Not to be greedy but I would love to be
Muffin’s guardian angel
God nods his approval starts away --
SATAN (CONT’D)
And she’1l need a nice set of parents
too
God nods his approval again starts away --
SATAN (CONTD)
And can I still give people colds Just

common colds

GOD
Don’t push it

SATAN
Okay fine then can I make a few
modifications to Muffin’s Robofriend

A smile grows on God’s face Satan pats God on the butt --

SATAN (CONTD)
Let’s do this

EXT MUFFINS HOUSE - DAY
Muffin and Robofriend make a snowman in the front yard --
MUFFIN
So I said “Who do you think I am Dan

Marino”

Robofriend and Muffin SHARE A LAUGH at what must have been a
very witty story

ROBOFRIEND
Oh you are a delight

As they continue with the snowman THE BULLIES creep to the
gate They gather snowballs then launch them at Muffin --

The snowballs get within an inch of Muffin’s head before
being INTERCEPTED BY ROBOFRIEND --

ROBOFRIEND (CONTD)
Oh no you didn’t

The robot immediately sprints after the bullies snowballs in
hand eyes glowing red --

The boys SCREAM sprint down the block Robofriend gaining on
them Muffin watches them run off smiles continues to play

A station wagon pulls up -- A YOUNG COUPLE steps out and
make their way into the yard -- towards Muffin --

MAN
You must be Muffin

Muffin smiles Nancy comes out to greet the couple -- As we
pull up and away --

FADE OUT

THE END
