INT NATIONAL GALLERY BOARDROOM - DAY

A very grand room with lots of wood and some very famous portraits
round the
walls

A group of grave gentlemen and gentlewomen They are the trustees of
the

National Gallery LORD WALTON a very grand man sits at the table
head To

his right sits his assistant GARETH All are deep in thought LORD
WALTON

fidgets with a pencil on the table He raises his head as though about
to

speak Everyone looks up expectantly And LORD WALTON goes back to
fidgeting So does everyone else

GARETH

CUT TO
EXT MR BEANS STREET DAY

Mr BEAN comes out of his house ready to face the world-
He walks up the street tutting slightly at a NO PARKING sign he
passes

The street is totally car-free except for a very visible lime
green mini A

policeman strolls by and glances down at a pair of legs sticking
out from

under it next to a toolbox He moves on satisfied that someone

is mending
their car

BEAN approaches the car and whips out the fake legs he left there
He then

unlocks the big padlock that secures the car door pops the fake
legs inside

fiddles with something else in the back seat and drives away at a
frightening

speed with a smug look on his face

The Theme Music - big and dramatic - begins as do the rest of the
credits

BEAN gaily motors on - then unexpectedly the sweeping theme tune
jumps as if

it has hit a scratch the cinema audience should be worried theres a
sound

fault

BEAN comes to a street full of sleeping policemen he goes at them at
quite a

lick - and every time he shoots over one of the bumps the theme tune
jumps

violently

BEAN looks a little annoyed into the back seat - we now see the cause
of the

problem Instead of having a car radio BEAN has an old record player
strapped into the back seat playing the theme tune

On he drives through empty streets - then JOLT - hes reached the
glorious
familiarity of Central London Big Ben and all - but heels now in
dreadful
traffic

Heels not happy He looks to the left and sees a very thin alleyway
He

takes out a metal comb from his pocket and using it like a bombers
sight-

line-checker measures the front of his car and the width of the
alley He S
satisfied - does a 90-degree turn - and shoots down the alley It is
such a
perfect fit that sparks fly from the door handles as they graze the
walls

But at the end of the alley the traffics just as bad BEAN
notices hes

outside Harrods Theres a tail-coated Security Guard at the
front door

BEAN watches him stroll a bit down the street - and takes his
chance He

turns and drives straight through the double doors into the

store

INT HARRODS DAY

BEAN and his car whizz through the ground floor past perfume counters
and
leather glove racks

CUT TO a Security Guard As he passes one of the counters
BEANs little car

just shoots behind him The Guard continues through the
Childrens section

there are giant elephants and teddies childrens size cars then
two huge

plastic tractors - and then stock still strangely in harmony
actually the

Lime Green Mini with BEAN in it The Guard walks straight past

The moment he is gone BEAN shoots off again - but damn spies
another Guard

and is forced to turn and drive down some very steep stairs indeed
The theme

song goes CRAZY as the record player jumps

CUT TO

6 people waiting at a gilded lift They hear a strange sound and turn
to see

what it is In fact its coming from inside the lift When the lift
doors

open out shoots the Mini through the double doors and back into the
street
EXT KNIGHTSBRIDGE DAY

Out in the street BEAN is faced by an accident There are flashing
lights a
crumpled car suggestions of hurt passengers BEAN looks concerned

CuT TO
EXT THE STRAND DAY

An Ambulance roars through the traffic It reaches its hospital turns
off

and there right smack behind it is the Mini Cut in to see BEAN
smiling

broadly He whizzes into Trafalgar Square maybe even across it
sending

pigeons and tourists flying and parks directly outside the statuesque
National Gallery Of course theres not another car there Just the
Gallery

and the mini

CUT TO

EXT NATIONAL GALLERY - DAY

BEAN gets out of the car takes out his bag - thinks a little
opens it and

takes out a Doctor on Call sign To re-enforce it he puts a bone
in the

back window and a skull of the front seat Happy with the
arrangement he re-

locks the padlock and sets off smiling up the big stairs to work

As he does so pan up the building and into the window of the room
where that
Board meeting was taking place

got the feeling back in his fingers - but his hands

stapled together

LORD WALTON
and how far are we with the computer Hubert

HUBERT

Timothy is loading the final catalogue data as we

Milord An awful thing to say but when the programs

running our Mr Bean will become a little less than

useful

A glimmer of hope

INT NATIONAL GALLERY PORTRAIT SECTION - DAY

BEAN wanders past three or four portraits and mimics the characters in

them

He passes a guard

GUARD
(not looking up from his book)
Morning Bean

The GUARD sighs with boredom He gets this from BEAN every day As

Bean

moves on

BEAN moves
on blithely

he treads on the heel of a tourists shoe It comes off-

INT NATIONAL GALLERY CARTOON ROOM ENTRANCE - DAY

BEAN is passing the very special room where Leonardo Da Vincis

cartoon

The
Virgin and Child hangs preserved by a very dim artificial light
There are

silhouettes of a few tourists in the room reverently studying the
work

listening to a female GALLERY GUIDE

BEAN dips into his pocket for his identity badge and in so doing
brings out a

coin The coin drops and rolls into the special room BEAN follows it
into

the darkness

GALLERY GUIDE

(hushed)
by Leonardo Da Vinci As you can see the
special light
in here goes some way to protect the drawing from
photodisintegration caused by gamma

The camera stays outside the room with the picture in view We hear
the

squeak of a tiny door open then a click The room is suddenly flooded
in

blazing white light The onlookers gasp in horror

BEAN re-emerges from the room with his precious coin As an
afterthought he

pops his hand round the doorway and turns off the light He scuttles
away

The GALLERY GUIDE shakes her head in total exasperation

CuT TO
INT NATIONAL GALLERY BOARDROOM - DAY

GARETH
Maybe it would be simpler to pack all our paintings onto
trucks
and move the entire National Gallery somewhere else And
not tell
him
HUBERT
Seconded We could all move to France
GEORGE

All those in favour

They all raise their hands wildly
LORD WALTON
Come on - settle down everyone

CUT TO

INT NATIONAL GALLERY ELEVATOR - DAY

BEAN stands in the elevator silently with four other people He
gives himself

a long squirt of breathfreshener Then offers it to the others
who politely

refuse him So he stands still again Pause BEAN then smells
something

unpleasant He leans and has a little sniff of the person to
his left All

right there Then he sniffs to his right and reels at what he
smells He

again takes out the breath freshener and forces it upon

VINCENT an elderly
gentleman who is mortified

At this moment the elevator stops - BEAN and VINCENT get out and the
camera

follows VINCENT as he heads for the boardroom door and enters He is
another

trustee This dialogue is heard from behind the closed door

VINCENT
Im sorry Im late

GARETH

Why cant we just give him the boot for crying out

loud

VINCENT
Steady on old man I only
GARETH
Not you you idiot
CUT TO
INT NATIONAL GALLERY CORRIDOR - DAY

BEAN with cup of tea walks along a corridor He cant not interfere
for

tidiness sake One empty room he switches off the light Another he
shuts
the door

He passes a computer room with an open door where a big man is busily
typing
in a programme - BEAN looks at him snootily and heads on

He approaches the door to his office A sign reads STORAGE and
CATALOGUE

There is a huge padlock on the door BEAN takes out a big key and
enters his

domain

CuT TO
INT NATIONAL GALLERY STORAGE OFFICE - DAY

BEAN enters Hes been here for years and made it his own Its an odd
little world Theres a framed picture of Shirley Bassey on his desk
and

Airfix planes hang from the ceiling Also a large cosy armchair anda
TV

A pleasant Man in a suit around 40 breezes in

SUIT MAN
Ah Bean Im looking for a painting by Van Hocht
Still Life
Circa 1670 Can do

BEAN nods This is what BEAN likes to do best The camera follows as
he
turns sees the extraordinary sight behind him

His office is just a tiny corner of a massive storage room
hundreds of feet

high and long the walls completely full of rack after rack of
stored

paintings At the end of the room we can see hundreds of
sculptures busts

modern abstracts men on horses classical maidens Rodins the
lot Its

like the giant storehouse at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark

BEAN sets off into it in his own eccentric way He knows exactly where
heels

going He climbs a ladder like you find in a library - then pushes
himself
off and whizzes the entire length of the room on slippery wooden
runners

He has now reached the sculpture area but the painting heels
looking for is

on the other side He crosses the room by using the sculptures as
a kind of

artistic obstacle course In front of him is the Burghers of
Calais a Rodin

statue of 5 prisoners in chains He simply walks across their 5
heads like

stones in a stream

He then comes to an abstract modern piece which he uses as a slide
and at the

end of which he crawls through the hole in the next modern thing
He then

begins to climb up various famous ancient statues using the mouths
as

footholes breasts as support codpieces as steps and empty eyes as
finger

holes

After a problem getting his foot caught in the jaw of a sculptured
dog he

walks flat along a modern sculpture then uses a sequence of classic
sculptures as stairs - on the head of a little Degas ballerina one
step on to

the bottom of a horse two steps onto the head of the person riding
the horse

three steps and now hes on the other side of the hall

He then triumphantly pulls out a painting Its the one

SUIT MAN
What would we do without you The entire inventory of
British Art
stored in that one curious brain of yours

BEAN laughs - delighted SUIT MAN exits and MISS HUTCHINSON

enters warily

MISS HUTCHINSON
Mr Bean Lord Walton would like to see you in the
boardroom

BEAN gives a little pleasured squeak How exciting for
him He follows MISS
HUTCHINSON out into the corridor

CUT TO

INT NATIONAL GALLERY CORRIDOR DAY

BEAN walks along the same corridor as before Turns off another
light Then

comes to the room where he saw the Programmer The computer
showing a Van

Gogh portrait is on and no-ones there BEAN who hates wasted
electricity

goes in to switch it off

We see the Van Gogh change to a pictorial representation of the
Storage room —

with an arrow pointing to where the Van Gogh is located BEAN is
clearly

going to be replaced by this programme Or not BEAN searches for
the

plug but its under acres of desk - so he simply pulls a cable out of
the

back the computer The entire system clicks off At which moment the
Programmer comes back in

PROGRAMMER
Whats happening here
BEAN
Ahm

With a slightly guilty smile he picks up the cable again looks with
puzzlement

at the five available places to plug it in and just takes a random
guess And

a disastrous one There is a ugly electrical fizzle The screens come
on

white then pop out completely

BEAN
Ah Ahm

BEAN realises that he has done something wrong and quickly shoves the
cable

into another circuit The Van Gogh appears happily on the screen BEAN
and

PROGRAMMER both give out a sigh of relief BEAN smiles and leaves
quickly

But a second later the computer screen disintegrates and the Van Gogh
slides

down the screen like a water-colour in the rain The PROG difficult to
breathe

LORD WALTON
You have your voting slips gentlemen Please
remember the

Americans are looking for something quite high powered
doctorate preferably

There is a knock at the door BEAN enters LORD WALTON smiles The
rest of

the faces in the room are looking dangerously close to smug BEAN is
very

nervous indeed

LORD WALTON
(gravely)
Ah Mr Bean Please take a seat for a moment I
have some news
which will not Im afraid
The phone rings LORD WALTON answers BEAN sits next to VINCENT and
sniffs
at him VINCENTs breath hasnt improved

LORD WALTON
(into phone)
Yes Put him on Timothy The computer Yes
When How
All of it Absolutely all of it Did you back it up
How long
will it Another six months Fair enough Come up
here
will you dear boy

He slowly hangs up Everyone has got the gist of what has just
occurred with

the new computer- The energy drains from them all as they contemplate
another

six months with BEAN still on the staff LORD WALTON coughs politely

LORD WALTON
As I was saying gentlemen The Grierson Gallery South
California Great opportunity Thousands-of miles-away
though it
is Doctorate or ( IMPISHLY ) no doctorate perhaps

All get the message at the same moment and hurriedly scribble on their
voting

slips The slips get handed down the line to LORD WALTON We see that
every

single slip has BEAN on it

LORD WALTON

Mr Bean Wonderful news You are going to America
MR BEAN
(overwhelmed)

Ooooh how lovely

There is a knock at the door The fat bespectacled
PROGRAMMER puts his head round it

LORD WALTON
(beaming)
Ah Timothy Youre sacked

CUT TO

INT NATIONAL GALLERY CORRIDOR - DAY
BEAN rounds a corner and walks towards us imitating a bowlegged
cowboy The

Theme from Bonanza plays He whips out his pair of imaginary six
shooters

spins them on his fingers and returns them to-their imaginary
holsters making

gun sound effects Hes very happy-He passes the Security Guard
- he draws

his gun on him - zero reaction the Guard just raises his eyebrows
and yawns

BEAN heads on through the gallery merrily - but suddenly his good
mood is

broken when he notices 3 schoolgirls entering a new exhibition
called The

Ultra-Human Form This worries him - and we soon see why - BEAN heads
in to

the room where all the paintings are very graphic nudes and the 3
girls are

having a good giggle

BEAN quickly rushes over and with his hand covers the breasts of the
painting
theyre inspecting

Two girls then move on to the next painting - which unfortunately also
has

breasts BEAN stretches and just manages to cover them with his other
hand

Now the third girl heads on so BEAN can drop the hand on the first
painting -

but now has to try to cover the breasts on the third painting
which is a real

long stretch away He cant quite make it so he takes off his
shoes which

gives him the extra 3 inches Again safe Just

Now all three girls leave the paintings - but to BEANs chagrin
head over

to a classical nude sculpture in the middle of the room Its like the

Graces 3 naked women back to back BEAN thinks fast He quickly whips
off

his

Belt and rushes over to the statue where he succeeds in looping it
round to
cover all six nipples

Unfortunately the girls have already lost interest and head over to
the other

side of the gallery To BEANs horror Because at that moment we
reveal what

is on the other side of the room A epic painting in the style of the
others

- with literally 40 graphically naked people

BEAN sprints across the room stands on a chair and desperately tries
to
cover a particularly lurid example of a gentlemans manhood

At which moment the teacher of the party and 40 other schoolgirls
appear and

scream in chorus BEAN thinks that it is the painting that has
caused offence

and is in outraged agreement with them He turns Cut wide to
reveal that

they are screaming because hes beltless

trousers have fallen down

himself left

behind He scampers to catch up

First catching under the handle - then the couch then

Four other chairs - and finally the deep freeze No-ones going
to get in

through that door

BACK IN THE HALL BEAN pushes the string back inside the
letter box and slaps
his hand in satisfaction He locks the doors enormous
padlock looks about
carefully to make sure no ones around and then hides the
key under a garden
gnome on the floor standing amongst a row of pathetic pot
plants

The lady checking in BEAN looks puzzled as she holds his passport So
he

pulls the shockingly stupid face Oh yes she sees thats the guy in

Apparently
your friends at the Gallery were so delighted that

INT AIRPORT LOUNGE - NIGHT

BEAN enters the first class lounge Its fairly empty but BEAN still

squeezes himself between an old lady drinking a cup of tea anda
very grand

looking American military man in a business suit

The Grand Man lights up a cigar This doesnt please Mr No Smoking
BEAN

First he waves the smoke away in small then big then huge wafting
motions Then he tries miming to cut it up into segments and move
them

aside The man pays no attention at all

BEAN puts a plastic mug over his face like a gas mask and breathes
heavily
The man looks at him - but doesnt give a damn

BEAN now takes a paper bag - catches some of the smoke and take it
over and
empties it into the dust bin

The Grand Man goes on smoking stubbornly He then sees a
magazine rack and
leaves his cigar as he goes to get one

DAVID
Sounds like a real coup sir getting this Doctor of
GRIERSON

Various things Thank you However as you know this is
not an

inexpensive venture and financially speaking were in
very

serious crap right now

He cant quite hide his tackiness) DAVID holds the door for GRIERSON
- then

sees an old woman coming towards him He waits for her to go through
and

due to his sweetness is again left behind He rushes to catch up
They are now passing the reception counter cum gallery shop DAVID
exchanges

smiles with the cashier ANNIE Very bubbly not very bright The shop
is

full of Whistlers Mother memorabilia - posters cards porcelain
statuettes

So Im wondering if one of you would have this guy
stay in your
home instead of some expensive hotel

Oh look I mean its kind of the last thing I mean
Id really
like to but things at home are kind of sensitive so I

CUT TO

INT MR BEANS BED-SIT - DAY

MR BEAN is ready to leave his room Battered old

suitcase in hand he checks the room from the doorway

Every conceivable thing that can be opened - cupboards

drawers fridge -sports an oversized padlock Even

Beans old GPO phone has one on its dial

BEAN looks across to his TEDDY who is lounging on a miniature chair
inside

an up-sided cardboard box The box is sits on an armchair A hand-
written

sign taped to its roof reads TEDDY HOTEL followed by three stars

A smaller sign informs us that the hotel is FULL BEAN is just
about to

leave but stops to consider Taking a felt tipped pen he adds two
more stars

on the hotel hoarding as a treat

He then slightly incomprehensibly begins to tie string it around
various
objects in the flat The fridge - the corner of a chair a couch leg

CuT TO
INT MR BEANS RESIDENCES HALLWAY DAY

BEAN leaves his flat lee notice a large official sign stuck on the
door

saying NO SMOKING He now turns his attention to the pieces of
string

hanging out the letter box in his door Grabbing the bunch of them he
pulls

CUT TO back inside the flat we now understand the string - as all the
furniture starts to move across the flat It works incredibly neatly
the

chair reaches the door

BEAN acts fast He takes the cigar - and quickly dunks it in the
old womans
cup of tea

He sits there guiltlessly as the Grand Man returns Simultaneously
the man

tries to suck the wet cigar and the Old woman drinks the disgusting
tea A

horrid experience for both

CUT TO

INT AEROPLANE - DAY

Boarding time BEAN enters the plane and turns right into the body
of the

plane After walking right down the plane he is directed by a
hostess back

up to first As he walks back we notice the ridiculous contrast

from
totally cramped accommodation with hundreds of children and muzak
to the
elegance and space of First class

BEAN couldnt be more thrilled There follows a sequence of short
moments
from this nightmare flight

1 The Old Tea-Drinking Lady is being helped with her luggage A
hostess
slides it into the compartment above her head

OLD LADY

Be careful Its for my Grand-daughter
The next instant BEAN comes up with his case He opens the same
locker and
tries to fit his case in Doesnt quite go - so he pushes it
violently We
hear crunching cracking sounds Finally its almost there - BEAN
slams the
locker door One final definitive though muffled smash The OLD
LADY looks

at BEAN suspiciously

2 BEAN sits down - and who should be his next door neighbour The
Grand Man

whose name is REYNOLDS BEAN smiles merrily The affection is not
mutual

Champagne comes round instantly BEAN takes it along with a small
bowl of

nuts and clinks glasses with his unsmiling partner BEAN tries to
impress

him by throwing nuts up into the air and catching them in his mouth
(a well

practised art) No response

BEAN then switches on the noisy overhead air blower Then cant turn
it down

again Its very stuck He manages however to push it away from his
face -

straight into REYNOLDS REYNOLDS looks annoyed BEAN guiltless

Then BEAN has an idea He takes a tissue out of his pocket puts in
his

mouth chews it into a spitball
And rams it into the blower Both of them are relieved REYNOLDS picks
up

his champagne to have his first proper sip And whapp The spitball
under

high pressure shoots

into it sending champagne spraying all over REYNOLDS Not a good
start

3--BEAN is reading the in-flight magazine Theres an annoying sound
He

looks sideways - it is the headphones of the YOUNG BOY in the seat
across the

aisle Hes fallen asleep with his headphones on BEAN looks annoyed
Then

suddenly decides to cut his fingernails with a little pair of scissors
he

carries He holds out his hand to snip the nail - and accidentally on
purpose

simply cuts the wire of the boys headset Thats better

4 Night Wide shot of the plane - everyone is asleep except one pool
of
light Its Mr BEAN still up reading

But even he is wilting His eyes close and his body starts to waver
towards

sleep Next to him REYNOLDS is in a total lying position - and
unfortunately as BEAN slowly tips over his mouth comes into direct
contact

with REYNOLDS flies

From across the compartment a hostess sees whats happening Shes

Completely His hand is spread on REYNOLDS face REYNOLDS eyes open
He

sees whats happened His arm goes up and rings for the Hostess

6 Morning has broken REYNOLDS is still trying to sleep - BEAN is
wide

awake The Hostess approaches and the MOTHER of the YOUNG BOY says
her son

isnt very well
BEAN decides to cheer him up He mimes an aeroplane which makes the
boy feel

more ill Then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking
bits of

paper to his tongue and eye-lids and fluttering them

He then brings out a scrunched up bag of Dolly Mixtures and does his
trick of

throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth The boy is
too ill

to be impressed

BEAN tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a
cowboy

and then a tough American Cop Nothing Then he has an extremely fun
idea

He empties the Dolly Mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them

He then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake
REYNOLDS when
he sees its got a hole in it No fun

Meanwhile the Boy has taken out his sick-bag BEAN is delighted -
yes

thats perfect He turns away for a split second to scrunch up the
useless

bag while unseen to him the boy vomits into his bag BEAN turns
grabs the

bag from him - blows into it puts it right into REYNOLDS face at
arms

length and smacks his hands together CUT at just the right moment

computer system Dr Bean - would you like to look at
this Very
exciting stuff

BEAN
Ahm NO
GRIERSON is slightly surprised But they persevere
BERNIE

What Im doing Dave is developing the ultimate user-
friendly
interactive public guide to the gallery

Punching buttons on the computer he reveals wonderful maps of the
gallery

and when clicking on sections of the map graphic explanations of each
rooms

contents

Meanwhile Bean has spotted a fan on the other side of the room
He moves

around the room always facing straight to the wall When he reaches
the fan

he switches it on unfortunately its a rotating fan - so to keep the
wind on

his trousers BEAN has to do a strange rhythmic dancing movement
following

the arc of the fan

DAVID
Its very good Bernie
BERNIE
But the particular glory of the system is that it can

also work
oh large screens in each individual room - so we can
network the
program to every room in the gallery

GRIERSON
Not bad eh What do you think Doctor Ah
Doctor Bean
BEAN turns shocked to have been observed He looks down at his

and HOORAY theyre dry at last Hes delighted and moves back

EXT THE GRIERSON GALLERY BY PARKING LOT - DAY

(About 5 pm) BEAN and DAVID head for the parking lot On the way
BEANs

interest is drawn to the MIME ARTIST we met before in his Clinton
mask

performing his heart out in front of the Dead Cars sculpture BEAN
lingers

The MIME accosts a woman pretending to brush dust from her clothes
comb

her hair etc The MIME is a bit of a pain in the ass really The woman
quickly moves on

BEAN is intrigued The MIME mimes climbing a ladder BEAN goes up next
to

him - and looks up Theres nothing there He decides the MIME is a
bit of

a tricky This is confirmed when the MIME pretends hes locked behind
a

pane of glass BEAN simply pokes his finger through the imaginary
glass

wall and hits the MIMEs nose

CUT TO DAVID watching bemusedly some
way off

The MIME is however delighted someone is taking an interest at last
He

takes a handkerchief from BEANs pocket and gets BEAN to guess which
hand

the hankys in Its not in the left Not in the right BEAN isnt
the

slightest bit impressed - he just reaches round and takes the hank-y
from

where its tucked into the MIMEs trousers - and heads away As he
moves

off the MIME touches h on the shoulder BEAN turns and the MIME
starts a

mocking gun duel He draws his guns BEAN is pretty unimpressed
The MIME turns his back and walks the 10 paces to draw 4 He turns

But now BEAN decides to settles it once and for all In a brilliant
piece

of big mime he puts together the biggest gun ever seen outside an
Arnold

Schwarzenegger movie He sets up a pedestal - opens a case lifts
out a

hugely heavy gun - then the 7 bits that click on that gun Then opens
another case and takes out the huge artillery shell to load it

The MIME is getting very frightened Then BEAN pulls up an imaginary

stool

to sit behind his mega-Gatling Gun The MIME begins to run away BEAN
twirls in his imaginary seat and lines up his sights following the

terrified MIME

Finally in a BOOM that almost knocks BEAN out of his imaginary seat
he

fires 10 seconds delay and the MIME falls in a very dramatic death

yards away

BEAN is happy - and heads back to the parking lot where DAVID arms
folded

leans against his car DAVID gets into his car BEAN opens the
passenger

door and thumps it loudly into the side of the expensive car next-door
(same

as this morning)

EXT SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT - DAY

DAVID parks next to a beaten up convertible

DAVID
Okay Ill get some steaks Alison loves steak Wine -
good
Candy No candy Alison hates candy We gotta do this
right

Bean or (looks at Bean) Just stay out of trouble
okay
BEAN nods DAVID gets out and heads for the mall Nearby woman
tramp (BAG
LADY) goes through a trash can

BEAN tries to control himself but weakens He plays with all the
buttons and

switches on the dashboard windshield wipers lights Then he notices
a

throbbing noise He gets out of the car to investigate

BEAN swiftly locates the throbbing sound The e-empty convertible has
its

engine running BEAN notices the keys in the ignition How stupid of
someone He turns off the engine and takes out the keys There are
several

people returning to their cars with groceries BEAN offers the car
keys to

them as if to say Are these yours

The following should take place at quite a speed real drama

Then suddenly A ROBBER dashes towards BEAN from the direction of
the Mall

weaving in and out of parked cars with a small white carrier bag
assumedly

full of money He wears jeans a black polo-neck and much to BEANs
delight

a PRESIDENT CLINTON face-mask As far as BEANs concerned this
is his old
friend the MIME

ROBBER throws the bag of money on to the back seat of the convertible
and gets

in - but he cant find the keys to start it He frantically searches
all his

pockets

BEAN leans into shot He holds out the keys grinning

ROBBER
Gimme the keys

BEAN runs away with them Or doesnt He is in mime mode - And runs on
the

spot getting faster and faster The ROBBER approaches this obvious
madman

He is quite a tough scary and scared individual
ROBBER
I said give me the keys

BEAN turns and holds out two hands just like the MIME did to him The
perplexed ROBBER picks one hand Wrong one He then pulls a gun
and puts

it hard to MR BEAN in BEANs face Passers-by scream and fall to the
ground

the bag lady amongst them Sudden harsh reality

But not to BEAN He simply takes the gun and waves it in the ROBBERs
face
ticking him off for breaking the rules

ROBBER
OKAY OKAY - TAKE IT EASY

BEAN gestures the ROBBER to turn around He does sure this sicko is
going

simply to shoot him in the head But instead BEAN puts his back to the
ROBBERs back and starts to count

BEAN
1234 5 678 910
He turns and gestures to the ROBBER its time to draw By this
time a crowd
has gathered
ROBBER

DAVID is hurrying back to the parking lot with a bag of groceries

and a big
bunch of red roses He stops dead in his tracks as he spots something

ALISON and CHARLES are sitting up on stools in the window of a coffee
shop

ALISON laughs at something that CHARLES says Their body language
suggests a

BEAN waves the gun at the ROBBER

ROBBER
I havent got a gun
But BEAN is pushing him to draw Finally
ROBBER

Okay okay I11 do it

He draws BEAN draws too They fire And BEAN really fires To his
amazement Onlookers scream BEAN throws the gun away in startlement

The ROBBER lunges for it BEAN kicks it away trying to help him
avoid such a
dangerous implement

The ROBBER lunges at BEAN who throws the keys away over his shoulder
The

ROBBER has to scrabble under a car for them- BEAN thinks of final joke
- and

niftly swaps the ROBBERs bag for one of the Old BAG LADYs bags A
few

dollar notes spill out of it

When the ROBBER emerges with the keys BEAN s waiting to escort him
to his

car He opens the door - then spots a tourist hiding and puts his arm
around

the ROBBER and gets him to take a photograph of them BEAN removes the
ROBBERs mask as the picture is taken Forgetting himself the ROBBER
smiles

for the camera

The ROBBER jolted back to reality by the sound of approaching Police
car

sirens jumps in the car and drives away BEAN waves goodbye to the
convertible as a couple of Police cars screech up COPS jump out

DAVID approaches the scene with groceries and roses What kind of hell
has
BEAN caused now But instead of trouble he sees the passers-by are
getting

to their feet applauding BEAN and whistling They crowd round the
COPS

explaining what a hero BEAN has been

BEAN hands over the gun to a COP He doesnt really understand what
all the
fuss is about He notices the BAG

LADY wandering away with her bags Should he tell her that he has
swapped one

of them for the ROBBERS No Hes getting too much attention to be
bothered

A COP comes up to BEAN It is COP 1 from the airport scene

BEAN calmly takes the picture and tears it in half He gives back the
ROBBER
half and puts the other half with himself on into his pocket BRUTUS

A whole page of Teddy Then three pages of BEANs mini with dates on
labels going way back
Then a whole page of garden gnomes

at an

There is a folded ironing board balanced over a roll of hall carpet

BEANs GPO phone rings on the table and its vibrations cause the
bust of

BEETHOVEN to fall over the edge of the table It lands on the end of

he
unlocks it Another light turns green and another buzzer sounds

Ill leave you with her for a few minutes Im sure
youll want
to give her a proper inspection But whatever you do
dont leave

BEAN nods DAVID leaves him BEAN is still for a while and
then goes up and
inspects it closely

He tuts disapprovingly as he spots dust on the bottom of the frame He
blows

it away fussily He steps back to admire the painting There is dust
up his

nose and SNEEZE - all over the painting

He takes out his handkerchief and wipes the spittle off in panic Then
looks

back at the painting Unfortunately there now seems to be a big blue
mark
right across Mrs Whistlers face

BEAN checks his handkerchief Yes theres wet ink all over it He
finds the

leaking pen in his pocket 0 God He takes out his shirt spits on it
and

tries to wipe the painting but he cant make the shirt reach it He
takes

the painting down from the wall and has another go NO GOOD The ink
just

spreads right over Whistlers Mothers pure white collar

BEAN now looks round in panic What the hell can he do He goes to
the heavy

door - and looks out into the corridor He hears someone coming
hides and

sees a young girl from the catering staff wheeling a slightly
squeaky trolley

past covered with a white cloth

He goes back in - and has an idea He goes to a little table in

the corner
and begins to take thing off it

The door opens and BEAN emerges pushing what appears to be a
trolley covered

with a white cloth Although if you look carefully this
trolley actually

has no legs It is the painting covered with the table cloth
To make it a

bit more convincing BEAN makes an apt squeaky noise

He proceeds along the thin corridor - and then sees another exactly
similar

trolley coming right towards him A problem As they get close BEAN
suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on-coming
man

BEAN
(silently mouths)
What the
When the man turns BEAN just twists his painting sideways and
shoots past
him We see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley-pusher when
he looks

along both sides of BEANs trolley There is a very very THIN WOMAN
behind

checking

Howls he getting on with the family

Ah Fine Its good Its great

We will be slightly distracted by the observation that

Americas most valuable painting is at this moment balanced on
a very thin

ledge three floors up - where Bean has put in outside the Mens

And howls Alison

Shes well shes good

Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of

Its great when people who work together can become real
friends

Isnt it

BERNIE
I like to think thats whats happened with you and me
even
though youre kinda my boss Still maybe it wont always
be that
way huh
DAVID doesnt quite see what BERNIE is getting at but smiles politely
Now we see BEANs plan - he has emerged at a nearby window He
cant reach
the painting at first So he stretches further and further out
the window
No good Finally he has to go out on the ledge He shoos away
the birds who
then decide to settle on him instead Finally he gets a hand on
the painting
As he does so he loses hold He just manages to grabs a window
before he
falls
DAVID

Look Ive left Bean on his own Nice to chat though
Bernie -
always a subtle joy

BERNIE
Thanks David Always a pleasure
Period

BEAN is slowly managing to claw his way back towards the open window
with the

painting It is an extraordinary piece of acrobatics DAVID turns to
go

BERNIE
By the way Dont know what you think Mr Vice
President but
Ive been hinting to the old man that someones got to
have the
balls to take some sort of emergency measures around
here - or
were all in the
crap house What do you think
DAVID
Emergency measures in your book means sack people
right
BERNIE
Not necessarily Thats where this ( POINTS TO HIS

comes in No Ive had a better idea than sacking people

hear soon enough

through

He sets the picture down on a table Darn The birds have done
their
business on it

He maniacally rummages through various dusty cans and bottles ona
shelf He

chooses a can too rusty to read its label takes off the lid and
sniffs

This smells like the right sort of stuff He pours the liquid on to a
rag and

rubs it on the face of Mrs Whistler The solvent effortlessly removes
the

ink stain Whistlers Mother looks as good as new

BEAN is so so relieved But then he notices something else
happening The

liquid did not stop with removing the stain It is now busy removing
Whistlers Mothers face entirely As Bean watches-in frozen horror
Americas most famous painting turns back to a blank canvas

BEAN thinks for a second - and then has a desperate thought
Removing the pen

that started all the trouble he decides to try to draw back on
Whistlers

Mothers face He doesnt have much time It shows Where once
was a

sublime oil painting is now a biro line-drawing which looks a

little like

block the

- anda

door on the other side of the room calmly opens and DAVID walks
in
DAVID
Seems to be a problem with the door (PAUSE) Wheres the
picture
gone
BEAN
Ahm
DAVID

What What
Pause Pause BEAN finally shows it Not a pretty sight

DAVID
Oh Jesus Oh God Oh Jesus God Oh Mary Mother of
Jesus Oh
Jesus of Nazareth
BEAN
oh dear
DAVID
What happened
BEAN
Ahm (setting himself up for an interesting
comprehensive
answer)

DAVID

Dont bother (panicking) Oh my god
He rushes to the door he just came in - and locks it

Wait a minute - why am I worrying about this I did it I
just go

out and tell them what happened - youre a madman from
England and

you did this terrible thing and its not my fault Thats
right

isnt it

BEAN nods knowing he deserves his doom

Perfect - and then they say - who left him alone with the
picture And I say - me And they say youre fired
And I

say right And so I get fired and you go to jail and
no ones

any happier
BEAN shakes his head

And then they say firing David isnt enough - lets
prosecute

him for negligence And they prosecute me and it turns
out I was

negligent and I go to jail and my wife leaves me and my
daughter
becomes a prostitute and I end up on Death Row sharing a
cell with

Butch McDick the infamous gay rapist - or worse I end
up in the

same cell as you

BEAN looks hurt

No noNow lets just be calm lets think about this
calmly

(he tries - and fails ) Oh Godigodigod Okay now
wait

Lets have another look at it

BEAN shows it to him

Jesus Im already thinking back to 5 minutes ago as
paradise

5 minutes ago - just walking along shooting the breeze
with my

old pal Bernie

BEAN then he has a brilliant idea He hangs the painting back up in
the

security cupboard and closes the doors Then he removes from his
pocket a

small note book

He scribbles something on it tears the page out licks it and sticks
it on
the cupboard door It reads “OUT OF ORDER

DAVID
Brilliant Brilliant Problem solved

BEAN is delighted

Apart from the tiny drawback that the first person who
opens the

cupboard will say -Look someones totally destroyed
Whistlers

Mother- lets kill them

BEAN is less delighted
No - the most important thing is tbat no-one sees it
Ever again

He locks the cupboard with his plastic card key-

Thats the first thing Then thats the first
thing

Next next is the next thing which is
obviously ritual

suicide Look lets get out of here Try to act
natural

The let themselves out and go into the corridor- BEAN acting his
version of
“natural - very liquid

CUT TO

INT CORRIDOR DAY-

They bump straight into GRIERSON and ELMER

GRIERSON
Ah David Showing Dr Bean our good lady
BEAN
Actually Im not a
DAVID
Thats right - Whistlers Mother Looking at his mother -
not his
father - not interested in his father Couldnt give a
flying
doughnut for his sisters or brothers - just his mother
Yes
GRIERSON
Well good - think I may go and look at her myself

DAVID
No

GRIERSON
Er pray tell me why

ELMER
Because theyve just cut her into tiny pieces sir
Thats why

BEAN and DAVID die and go to hell until ELMER laughs at his own little
joke
GRIERSON laughs too

ELMER
I better continue my rounds sir

He strolls away

DAVID
The thing is sir Ive just been giving the painting a
very
thorough inspection with the help of Dr Bean here - and
we feel
the times come for Whistlers Mum to have her first face-
lift
GRIERSON
Time taken its toll on the old girl eh
DAVID
Exactly Shes in a surprisingly terrible state
Isnt she
Bean
BEAN
Oh yes
DAVID

Whistler was a great painter but he wasnt a great
chooser of
paints

BEAN hudders at the thought of his paint-choosing

The colours are beginning to fade However if you give me just
one little

year I can restore the picture to its original glory the way it
looked when

Whistlers Mom first looked at it and said 0 Actually Im not

sure youve

got the hair right darling
great today

sir

By the way your hair is looking

GRIERSON
Thank you David However flattery will get you nowhere
Truth
is I have a rather different plan for Whistlers dear
Mama
Bernie and I have been inspecting our books - and the
long and

short of it is we cannot survive with our current
losses so

DAVID
you have to sack me I understand sir Ill
go quietly In
fact Ill go right now
GRIERSON
No no no hold on We cant sustain our loses - so

Ive
decided to sell Whistlers Mother

DAVID lets out a little yelp

GRIERSON
Brilliant huh I already have a prospective buyer
- the current
Governor of California no less who is flies in
tomorrow to
inspect her and clinch the deal Spread the news I
think
decisive leadership has done the trick dont you
DAVID
Yes sir Yes sir Congratulations Marvellous
thing Bravo
GRIERSON leaves DAVID turns to BEAN
DAVID
Bean Do you drink
BEAN shakes his head
DAVID

Neither do I

CUT TO
INT BAR - NIGHT

It is very late and very gloomy Just a couple of loners staring into
their

drinks The BARTENDER is up one end of the counter smoking and
reading the

sports pages There is a TV on above the bar showing baseball

BEAN and DAVID are sitting up at the bar The latter has had far too
much

whisky and looks the worse for it BEAN has a tall glass packed with
fruit

and paper umbrellas We can guess how much hes had to drink by the
way he

has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth DAVID almost but not
quite

slurs his words

DAVID
Its just a matter of acceptance isnt it lose your
job -
lose you wife Cest la vie You ever been married
Bean

He turns to BEAN who has the end of a straw up his nose

DAVID
I guess not
He fills his glass from a bottle
You know I dont get it The New Artist exhibition-

this year -

people might not all have liked the dead sheep but
the place

didnt look that empty to me It wasnt full but I saw
people I

just dont understand how the gallery can be so
bankrupt they have

to sell the Whistler

He looks at BEAN who now has peanuts in each nostril
DAVID notices the BARTENDER looking at BEAN strangely

DAVID
Hes English okay You wanna make something of it
BARTENDER goes back to reading DAVID searches for his last train of
thought
taking a huge swig from his drink

DAVID
To hell with the figures Im not a damn accountant

Im an

artist You know me and Ali met in art school I cut
quite a

figure then Far cry from the man you see before you now
Then

I smoked Gitanes before I went to bed to help me sort out
the

problems of the world Now I take a spoonful of laxative
before

I go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my
bowels

BEAN at that moment is keen to show DAVID his nut trick He throws a
peanut

high into the air - and catches it in his mouth Then does two Then
does it

with his eyes closed Actually its rather impressive

DAVID

Truth is I disappointed her I turned out to have no
spine

Spineless A kind of medical miracle Mr Flippy-Floppy I

just dont seem to be able to fight - cant stick up for
myself

Too nice I mean I should never have let you come stay
and I

should be handing you over to the police right now Shall
I

tell you something Beanie
Bean has been interested all this even looking to check whether
David does
indeed have no spine But now the baseball on the TV is making it
hard for
him to concentrate on-this important confidence He raises a
finger for
DAVID to be quiet for a second He blows a peanut from his
nostril at the
TV - it hits the button and changes station to a pleasant quiet-
music

station
DAVID
Do you want to know what the reality of the situation is

BEAN nods his head very curious listening hard

This is it Because you moved into my house my wife has
left

me She might have done it anyway - but you were the ten
ton

weight that broke the camels spinal column

BEAN stares at DAVID - something is getting in hes actually
registering this

Thats point one And point two - is that youve

destroyed

Whistlers Mother which was the last hope for the place
where

I work So within a week Im going to lose my job as
well

BEAN nods seriously dispirited

DAVID
So youve totally and utterly destroyed my life Do you
understand Youve put me in a position where it would
have been
better if Id never been born

He puts his hand on BEANS shoulder BEAN looks down

Very sad This is actually the first time in his life that hes
realised that

his actions have really effected the life of another person BEAN

looks up
sadly Sad music plays

CUT TO

INT LEARY HOUSE DAVIDS ROOM - NIGHT

DAVID is asleep in bed The camera moves out into the hall and
into BEANs
room

INT THE LEARY HOUSE BEANS ROOM- NIGHT
BEAN is lying fully dressed in the darkness on his back Thinking
Worried by what hes heard Then suddenly an idea comes into his eyes
The

music is like his brain He jumps off the bed

There follows a version of the classic tooling up for action sequence
But

the tools here are distinctly bizarre BEAN picks up his suitcase
and in

quick cuts rushes through the house and collects

DAVIDS PLASTIC KEY CARD
A PAIR OF Y-FRONTS

A TORCH

SOME OF KEVINS CHEWING GUM 6 EGGS

A COOKING BASIN

A CUP

A LARGE PAINT BRUSH

A BOTTLE OF CLEAR NAIL VARNISH DAVIDS LARGE TIN OF LAXATIVE A
HAIR DRIER

AN ACTION MAN DOLL

A POSTER OF THE GIRL AND HER BOTTOM WITH THE TENNIS BALL

TWO OVEN GLOVES

A SKATEBOARD

AND 4 VOLUMES OF THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA
Fully tooled he snaps the suitcase shut

CuT TO

EXT GALLERY NIGHT
The building is floodlit by ground spots

BEAN arrives silently with suitcase on the skateboard Soon his full
plan

will be revealed The Gallery is empty apart from the one Security
Guard

BUCK visible through the glass front of the building drinking
coffee

watching his 12 security monitors BEAN swallows at the sight of BUCK
- he is

a massive gorilla of a man
CUT TO

INT GRIERSON GALLERY RECEPTION - NIGHT

BUCK is casually watching his screens when suddenly horror of
horror the

huge silhouette of a person hanging themselves from a tree outside
appears

the shadow of the limp body thrown across the floodlit gallery wall
BUCK

frantically rushes out And BEAN subtly slips in

CUT TO

EXT GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT

BUCK is looking for the body amongst the trees He finds nothing
Because he

fails to notice the tiny ACTION MAN swinging gently in front of one of
the

ground-level floodlights

CUT TO

INT GRIERSON GALLERY - NIGHT’

Inside BEAN is casually pouring the entire contents of DAVIDs
large laxative

tin into BUCKs coffee He also swaps two keys on the board of
keys by the

desk He then takes the opportunity to put the oven gloves on
his feet one

shaped like a pig one like a crocodile so he can move
silently

BUCK returns He sits down and takes a long gulp of coffee Pause
BEAN

watches BUCK feels something uncomfortable in his stomach He takes a
key

from his rack of keys and sets off and rounds a corner- On a monitor
screen

BEAN watches him break into a canter - as he passes through another
monitor

BUCK is at full sprint BEAN giggles
BEAN is satisfied hell be uninterrupted for a while He goes to the
key-

rack borrows two keys and sets off on his mission The next 3
minutes of

film are a sequence of cuts between three scenarios

FIRST BUCK - his next 10 minutes are not happy ones When he
reaches the

toilet the key he chose does not unlock it He has to sprint
back grab all

the keys and charge back again to the door Then he has to try
out every

single key We never see him find the right one

SECOND scenario - all the activities of the night shown on the
security

monitors BUCK sprinting desperately through shot - BEAN casually
going about

his business and on one occasion BUCK running right past BEAN
but not

seeing him - he has other things on his mind

THIRD scenario - we actually see BEANs Big Plan

He unlocks the merchandise shop So he can see properly and have his
hands

free he puts the y-fronts on his head and wedges the torch into
them like a

head-lamp He then takes a poster of Whistlers Mother and replaces it
with

the rolled-up Tennis Ball Girl He unrolls the Whistler and places the

encyclopaedias on its corners to hold it down

He separates the yokes from the eggs mixes the whites with clear nail
varnish
and varnishes the-poster with it Dries it off with the hair drier

With the now stiff poster he heads up elevators and escalators to
get to the

Whistler Room itself all the time chewing gum frantically Once
there he

unlocks the final cupboard with Davids plastic key takes the
Whistler down

and removes the destroyed Mother from its gilded frame and its wooden
support
frame He uses the chewed gum to stick the new one down to the old
frame

He then puts the very convincing forgery back into the security
cupboard and

relocks it with DAVIDs key card

The job is done He scrunches up the old torn picture pops it in
a dustbin

and heads off

ground
floor gallery He clicks through various paintings and stops at the

and
enlarges the painting to fill the screen

He happily hums the catchy tune from GOBLINS 2 and homes in on the

tiny

padlock on the chastity belt Padlocks interest him He clicks on the
keyhole rapidly (as we have seen him do with the frog in GOBLINS 2)

MR BEAN
Click click click click click

the

whole screen starts to flash before going dramatically back to
black

Now flashing in the centre of the monitor is an icon of a tiny key
Beneath

it a row of six dashes appears (eg - - - - - - - ) A cursor is
flashing

over the first dash

BEAN is totally absorbed He loves these kinds of puzzles With one
finger

he slowly types out letters on the keyboard (he has to search for some
of

them) As he does so they appear over each dash in turn

G-O-B-L-I-N

exits BEAN goes back to the code He types in the first thing that

something is
dawning on him he punches in

P-E-R-I-0-D

Up comes a message CODE ACCEPTED Close on BEANs face as light

If only he could get that open He pushes various buttons which
set of

windscreen wipers squirters radios He pushes the cigarette
lighter
Finally he pulls a lever - and the bonnet pops up an inch

At which moment we see the lighter shoot out and on to the seat BEAN
is

still looking round below the dashboard when he notices a little fire
in the

seat beside him Not good news

BEAN panics a bit turns and half climbs over into the back
seat when he

spies a drinks cabinet He has a very good idea - he finds
a cut crystal

decanter of brown liquid opens it and uses it to douse the
fire Nota

wise move with brandy Before the cut we see the WHOOOSH

of a major fire
in the front seat of the car

DAVID
Great - keep him out of trouble

CUT TO

INT PARKING LOT - DAY

BEAN is inspecting the car Hes not too happy with it He tries to
get

the bonnet down but it insists on staying up He shrugs his shoulders
and

gets in to drive off again having to wind down the window and drive
by

leaning his head out This means that as he heads for the exit he
fails to

see the system to stop people leaving without paying a foot high
barrier that

appears out of the ground When he hits it the car stops dead

BEAN gets out leaving the car idling and goes to the booth where
normally the

attendant would be - but everyone is in the gallery at the moment
Inside he

pushes a couple of buttons and hurrah gets the one that drops
the barrier

Less hurrah he has forgotten to put on the hand brake

As he moves back towards the car it glides slowly down the ramp on
the

outside of the building then accelerates and finally ona
particularly

sharp turn smashes through the wall and flies off the building
We hear a

crash - but do not see where it lands

GOVERNOR REYNOLDS turns away from another picture

REYNOLDS
Can we go and see Mrs Whistler now My eyes are

The party follows DAVID as he walks through the gallery towards the
double
doors to take the lift to the Whistler Room An excited atmosphere

CuT TO
INT WHISTLER ROOM DAY
Everyone enters

DAVID
Ladies and gentlemen - most of you have seen Whistlers
Mother
before can I ask you just to step back Thank you

Its part of his plan of caution - he knows theres something wrong -
and

wants as few people as possible to see the painting close up The
crowd

moves back

DAVID
Id like the Governor to have as it were a private
audience with
his new friend

REYNOLDS is flattered Silence DAVID inserts the plastic card key -
opens

the doors - and sure enough there in all its glory is Whistlers
Mother’

Respectful silence

REYNOLDS is delighted He stands back to inspect her
REYNOLDS
Well hello Maam Yes - she certainly looks a million
dollars to

me - or should I say ten million dollars
Everyone applauds
GRIERSON
Bravo - what do you say to a final glass of though I
say it

myself rather expensive champagne (grins smugly)

People start to file out REYNOLDS GRIERSON BERNIE and DAVID stay
behind

DAVID spots BEAN arriving He hands the car keys back to BERNIE with a
slightly dazed smile DAVID eagerly takes his arm and brings him over

DAVID
Governor I dont believe youve met Dr Bean our expert
from
England

They turn to each other - recognition from BEAN its the man from the
plane

He does a very quick hand-shake and tries to make a getaway before
REYNOLDS

recognises him

BEAN
Ah hello sorry I Ahm sorry

BEAN turns In fatal slow motion he trips over the cord that stops
anyone

getting too close to the great painting He spins and falls in the
direction

of the painting

CUT TO the looks of horror on all the faces

CUT TO BEAN reaching out to keep himself standing We think hes
going to

tear the painting He doesnt He simply catches hold of the bottom of
the

ornate frame It snaps off

CUT TO a look of relief for an instant on all faces

CUT TO the truth - as the frame breaks off there is the little white
strip
saying THE GRIERSON GALLERY HOME OF WHISTLERS MOTHER-

grinders

ALISON

DAVID
Good thinking (pause) You still call it home

ALISON looks at him seriously

INT OPERATING THEATRE NIGHT

Inside the operating theatre a body is waiting in position There are

attending nurses and an assistant doctor They all look up to BEAN as
he

enters fully kitted up

ASSISTANT
Good evening Doctor What we have here is a bullet wound
in the

lower thorax it seems to have ruptured the lung and
theres

severe inner bleeding along the abdomen

NURSE 2
Hes coming round

ASSISTANT
Give him a T 70 straight away

The victim starts to move - he looks up - we see his face for the
first time

It is the police officer BRUTUS He is in great pain As the sedative
shot

goes in BEAN takes off his mask and smiles with a little wave A
look of

total panic goes over BRUTUS eyes as he loses consciousness

ASSISTANT
Shall I do the cut sir

BEAN nods - hes not going to argue with anyone The assistant cuts
BEAN is

horrified almost faints then snatches the knife He cant believe
this

maniac has just cut through another personas flesh

ASSISTANT

Im sorry its only MY first week

BEAN hands the knife to the NURSE testily

NURSE

Im afraid well now have to wait for the X-rays Doctor
or well

never find the bullet Come on everyone sort out the
support

systems
EVERYONE turns to get on with their particular jobs BEAN is left
with the
body A pause He gets a little bored Takes a sweet packet out
of his
pocket Only one sweet left he takes it out lovingly and then

does what he
always does - throws it up into the air to catch it in his mouth
Unfortunately he forgets that he is wearing a mask It hits the
middle of
the mask and bounces into the cut in the body

BEAN looks down annoyed Checks round him - everyones still busy So
he

puts his hand in the body really rummages around finds the sweet
takes it

out and then realises hes in fact got the bullet between his
fingers

Guiltily he slips it back into the body rummages a bit more finds
the

sweet wipes it and pops it in his mouth At which second the X-ray
arrives

ASSISTANT

Here we go doctor ( STUDYING THE X-RAY ) the bullet is
here -

so well probably have to extend the cut to here Think
we all

better be prepared for a long one here This is tricky
BEAN tuts scornfully - youre wrong 1 reaches in again feels around
fora

second and triumphantly produces the bullet between his fingers

They all applaud

and

heads on fast before hes found out He turns the corner and suddenly
sees

ALISON looks round and shakes her head BEAN kicks DAVID in the
shins

DAVID looks round puzzled There is a poster of the human skeleton

from

it

Another doctor comes along - the same one who they spoke to first
Hes
young confident slightly arrogant

ALISON
Excuse me doctor

DOCTOR

familiar faces DAVID BERNIE ELMER ANNIE BEAN looking nervous and
shifty Dead silence as GRIERSON stands very solemnly

GRIERSON

Colleagues - what can I say Incidents such as occurred
yesterday

teach a man important lessons On reflection I realise
it would

have been a sin to sell Whistlers Mother to such an
impertinent

philistine as Governor Reynolds And therefore I blame
myself

for having ever let things get to such a pass that we
felt we had

realise our the staff - twelve got today Ive Schimmel
as to sell

her I suddenly problem here hasnt been its been the
leadership

flabby lazy- And so decided to appoint Bernie my new
Vice-

President

CUT TO BERNIE looking smug next to DAVID who is pretty shocked by
this

GRIERSON
Hes a man with a plan who will haul us into
profitability and
the 21st century

BERNIE
Thank you sir Although Im afraid I dont
quite see how we
can
GRIERSON

Good point Bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive
interjection Id expect from my new VP How can we

you ask

survive without Whistlers Mother - our single greatest
asset

Well the truth is - we cant So what am I saying
Will we

find her again Never - this robber was clearly the
work of a
criminal of great genius

BEAN looks pleased - but then realises its not a suitable emotion
so nods
sagely

Insurance Not a chance Those bastards never pay So

surely were bankrupt Surely your jobs are forfeit
Surely

youre back on the unemployment lines scraping a
living as

waiters and boys Yes Yes indeed Except for one

little

thing one little thing done by one little man Dare I
say

one helluva little man Watch this
Everyone is totally at a loss GRIERSON stands and moves to the
framed poster
of Whistlers Mother on the wall He then produces a plastic key
card and
inserts it in a slot on the side of the frame A buzz and a click
An
electric motor starts to whirrrr

The glass along with the title strip at the bottom of the poster
slides

gently down inside the picture frame to reveal that the poster is in
fact the

original oil of Whistlers Mother

GRIERSON
Ladies and gentlemen The REAL Whistlers Mother
There are gasps from the room BEAN is open mouthed

GRIERSON beams as many applaud and BEAN now joins in hyperactively
Hes

saved

criminal But no master criminal is a match for me

flowers

The chief said I was to give you these
BEAN is delighted Then sniffs the flowers What a nasty stink

Not his

SIDE-KICK drives AWAY GRIERSON turns to DAVID
GRIERSON
I owe you a very serious apology young man It wouldnt

GRIERSON
Mmmmm
DAVID
Maybe two cars
GRIERSON
A car sounds sensible
DAVID

DAVID heads off BEAN wants to follow but needs to get rid of the
stinky

flowers He turns to ANNIE and gives them to her to be rid of them
She

beams with delight after all he DID love her

BEAN heads off with DAVID to the parking lot As they go DAVID
puts an arm

round BEAN
Who shoos him away instantly No sloppiness for him

BEAN KEVIN and DAVID get into the car It pulls away as they

drive off BEAN
sticks his hand of the window - and waves a last farewell to
ALISON and

JENNIFER At last a sentimental moment - romantic music
swelling - like Liza
Minelli at the end of Cabaret

Until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate
as the
car squeezes past

INT NATIONAL GALLERY GALLERY 1 DAY
The place is totally empty except for a CLEANER sweeping up litter
in the

all the

paintings should be Only one very solid looking statue remains

thoroughly perplexed

empty
gallery and shakes his head

What will he do now with his life

Behind the credits we see close-ups of BEAN hammering away at large
planks of
wood on some wooden structure

He walks away from it - without us seeing what it is
and goes to his Mini where TEDDY sits on a pile of books in the
front seat
wearing a seat belt Bean gets into the car which is laden with
suitcases
starts it up and drives

straight into the huge crate he has built A rope tied to the
back

bumper pulls the lid closed behind him

CUT TO

The crate sits on the back of a speeding truck

The crate is now on the top of a forklift truck moving up the ramp on
an

American airline cargo plane Close up on a large sticker on the
crate it
reads DAVID LEARY 23 WOODFORD AVENUE CHESTERFIELD CALIFORNIA

And cut to the plane flying through clear skies Though for the
Lears of
course there are no clear skies ahead
