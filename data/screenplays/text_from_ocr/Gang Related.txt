VIC The second is large heavy-set shaved head His
name

is CUTLESS SUPREME Cutless Supreme is not a man to be
messed

with

vic
Keepin some late hours

Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme

RODRIGUEZ
What the hell you doin Whatre my
neighbors gonna think

vic
I apologize I understand your
concerns But you must understand
that unlike a bank I cannot rely
on a late fee as sufficient
encouragement to repay ones debts
I am forced to employ the likes of
Mr Cutless Supreme whom I might
add contributes significantly to my
overhead I am the real loser here
And I am concerned about your
sincerity in repaying the twenty-
seven thousand nine hundred forty-
two dollar gambling debt that is one
week past due What can you do to
reassure me of your good intentions

RODRIGUEZ
I can make your life fuckin miserable
thats what I can do

vic
Look at me Do I have a wife and
three kids Do I have a good job at
IBM Am I a handsome guy No no and
no I loan money at excessively high
interest rates to pricks like you
who cant control their urges to

lose big money playing cards and

then I am forced to stay up all night
trying to convince them that I have
needs too The point of which is I
already have a fuckin miserable
life So dont threaten me you lousy
bag of cat shit

Rodriguez steps toward Vic but Cutless Supreme slides
in
between them Rodriguez isnt going to win this one

vic
All Im askin is that you be
responsible Is that unreasonable

Rodriguez backs off hesitates as he runs over his
options

There arent any He reaches into his pocket pulls out
some

of his nights earnings

RODRIGUEZ
Four thousand is all I got

vic
I am proportionally reassured You
purchased yourself an extension

Vic takes the money heads for the street Rodriguez
watches
Vic walk away Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez

RODRIGUEZ
Cutless Supreme what kind of fuckin
idiot name is that

CUTLESS SUPREME
It was the car my daddy stole to
take my momma to the hospital but
the cops stopped him and shot him
dead in an alley before he could
explain I was born in the back seat

Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme then he shuts the
door

was supposed to be gang-related and
unsolved Only because we tagged a
goddamn undercover cop do we need
the fucking 44 for evidence
Otherwise we never woulda needed
it So dont point your finger at
me

Alright alright But how are we
supposed to explain how the same gun
was used in two murder cases by two
different killers when it was supposed
to be in police custody

DIVINCI

fault they lost the evidence
Ballistics are already complete in
Dunners case All we need is another
