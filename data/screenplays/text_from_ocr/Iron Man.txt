IRON MAN

EXT JUNGLE -- NIGHT

The Jungle twisted and lush It’s quiet We realize that
we are looking DIRECTLY AT A NAVY SEAL in black and green
Tiger-Stripe Camouflage He speaks into his WHISPER-MIKE

SEAL CAPTAIN
Move now

A WAVE of STATIC overwhelms his quiet order

SEAL CAPTAIN (cont’d)
Dammit -- Unit move now

TITLES SINUIJU N KOREA 35 MILES SE OF THE CHINESE BORDER

MOVEMENT all around as a hidden SEAL TEAM moves from the
shadows -- TWENTY in all

SEAL CAPTAIN (cont’d)
Briggins

One SEAL crawls forward The Captain gives the signal to
“move forward” and “look” BRIGGINS crawls silently forward
like a Snake to a BREAK in the bush He raises a pair of
advanced ELECTRONIC BINOCULARS whose make reads STARK

BRIGGINS
I’ve got visual on the factory

SEAL CAPTAIN
Movement

BINOCULAR POV Is in NIGHT-VISION GREEN though remarkably
BRIGHT and DETAILED The area around the huge CONCRETE
BUILDING has been CLEARED of dense foliage

BRIGGINS
Quiet like a church-mouse I don’t
know Cap I don’t

BRIGGINS trails off as STATIC builds again But that’s not
what stopped him A FLYING METAL OBJECT rounds the corner
of the Factory He FOCUSES on it BRIGGINS’ FINGER flicks
the SHUTTER CLICKING off digital photos

ANGLE ON The FLYING METAL DRONE which patrols the building
With protruding antenna like a metal star it hovers by way
of an OSCILLATING LIGHT skimming silent through the air
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 2

BRIGGINS (cont’d)
It’s Some kinda drone

At the mere STATIC produced by his voice the DRONE over
three hundred feet away SPINS to face BRIGGINS A powerful
SPOTLIGHT BEAMS from it as an ALARM PEALS across the trees
Even before the ULTRA HIGH-SPEED GUNFIRE begins to fly
Briggins knows it’s all gone very very wrong

SEAL CAPTAIN (V0O)
FALL BACK Unit is compromised
Repeat unit is --

The transmission is CUT OFF by a sudden SHRIEK of STATIC
The forest EXPLODES in GUNFIRE behind Briggins Suddenly
the SEAL radio channel is flooded with SCREAMING MEN

The swiftly approaching DRONE is FIRING on Briggins BOLTS
of LIGHT which EXPLODE the ground around him with shocking
intensity So he runs

EXT JUNGLE -- NIGHT

BRIGGINS clips through the trees unable to see through the
smoke and dense foliage whipping into him HIS BOOT CATCHES
on an overgrown TREE ROOT sending him flying THROUGH THE
LEAVES to CRASH to the ground in a heap He gazes up

BRIGGINS
Holy Mother of God

An advanced ARMORED TANK LOOMS UP before him Its SPOTLIGHT
and GUNS SWING DOWN to aim at his pale face

Briggins FIRES his AUTOMATIC RIFLE SHATTERING the SPOTLIGHT
just as the tank FIRES a hammering BOLT OF LIGHT The ground
EXPLODES but Briggins is already up and running again

It FIRES BOLTS of LIGHT like crashing thunder Briggins
sprints for his life He SKIDS to a STOP face to face with
a DRONE flying at him Briggins spins toward the trees as
a BOLT of LIGHT hits him IN THE ARM BLOWING HIM THROUGH THE
TREES Suddenly he is FLYING OUT OVER --

A FIFTEEN FOOT DROP into a JUNGLE RIVER -- SPLASH He is
WHISKED OFF into the RAPIDS which RUSH a gasping Briggins
off into the darkness trying to speak over the water

BRIGGINS (cont’d)
Cap Anyone Control Come in

named KELNER SMITH is fidgety sweating Rhodey sees Kelner
take a HANDKERCHIEF from his breast pocket wipe his beading
forehead with one shaking hand and return it to his right

The crowd sighs No-one could’ve survived this crash

DEAD SILENCE as the smoke clears The craft is SHREDDED --
Except for the COCKPIT whose CUSHIONED G-RESISTANT ARMORED
CASING has held together like A PERFECT METAL BOX

SLOWLY the COCKPIT OPENS The crowd holds its breath

PUSH IN ON TONY STARK RISING from the wreckage the FLAMING

INT MILITARY BASE -- SOUTH KOREA - HALLWAY -- NIGHT
Richard walks Bethany down the spare white halls

RICHARD
You changed your name back to Cabe

BETHANY
Rennselaer was too hard to spell
What was a SEAL team doing that
close to the Chinese border

RICHARD
It was supposed to be simple Recon
SAT-COM picked up an un-ID’d
warehouse outside Sinuiju We s3ent
them in to check it out

BETHANY
Private or Government installation

RICHARD
They never got a chance to find
out What’s Homeland Security’s
interest in our boy

BETHANY
His story’s pricked up some ears
Especially the part about --

RICHARD
Previously Unidentified Ordinance --
“Ppuo” they’re calling it

BETHANY
PUO attracts attention If the
Koreans have new weaponry we’1ll
trust the CIA to take care of it
But if private guerillas are
capable of wiping out a whole SEAL
team we’d like to see them secured
as quickly as possible

RICHARD
Look Beth this thing is Scary

BETHANY
Scared You

RICHARD
All I’m saying is if the North
Koreans have weapons like these

Mrs Arbogast folds her hands in her lap not giving an inch

MRS ARBOGAST

Miss Cahill I am given minute by
minute updates on my father’s

TONY
This is where I play
(xe the TECHNICIANS)
This is where they work

JEREMY
By the way where’s my money

TONY
You’ re going to hold me to that I

JEREMY
Close doesn’t count Crash-Test If
not for your impact armor on the
cockpit Id be talking to a grease
spot

TONY
(to Tara)
What he fails to realize is how
many lives I’ve just saved by
surviving a vehicle crash at better
than a thousand miles per hour

Tara smiles up at him impressed
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 16

JEREMY

TONY
(laughs)
Fine I’ve got cash in my office

INT STARK REALITIES -- NIGHT

TARA looks through a MICROSCOPE at A MICROCHIP Not the

crisscrossed with delicate complex silver CIRCUITRY

TONY
This Chip savei my life

TARA
What does it do

JEREMY
It’s an Implant Chip It monitors
your central nervous system

TONY
I was climbing Everest and we got
hit by freak wind shears

Jeremy looks to Tara entranced by Tony’s exploits

JEREMY
That happens to me a lot too

TONY
We were trapped couldn’t go up or
down The radios were useless
I dug out a shelter and we just
holed up on the mountain trying
not to freeze to death

TARA
(awed)
What happened

JEREMY
He was killed

TONY
The next morning my base camp
tracked our signal via this exact
Chip and pinpointed our location
for rescue
TRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 17

TARA
Wow

JEREMY
Just imagine if we put them in
fighter pilots

TONY
No military contracts

Tony shoots Jeremy a look and walks Tara off to FRANKIE who
ACTIVATES a large REPULSOR LIGHT GENERATOR right on cue

TONY (cont‘d)
But this is our crown jewel

The huge GENERATOR ASSEMBLY RISES INTO TEE AIR floating on a
bed of SOLID LIGHT Impressive

TONY (cont’d)
Repulsor Light I’ve spent my
whole life creating this

TARA
What is it like a laser

FRANKIE
(scoffs)
Lasers Remember the 20th Century

TONY
A laser amplifies light to create a
focused beam of heat and radiation

Tony places a loving hand on the floating generator It
SPINS in its bed of light unfettered by gravity

TONY (cont’d)
Emitting no radiation Repulsor
Light offers infinitely variable
levels of light heat and force
It can provide lift for flying
vehicles be used for drilling
through rock anything It’s like
“solid light” if you will

Tara’s hand subtly brushes Tonys

TARA
Oh I think I will

TONY
Yeah We should go

Just then TARA opens the BEDROOM HATCH dressed in a very
expensive sheet The half-naked woman freezes as she sees
Bethany on deck Bethany nods She should have known

BETHANY
Later it is

Bethany jumps back onto the dock and walks off

TARA
Are you okay Who was that

Tony picks up the PHONE in the WHEEL-HOUSE dials

TONY
Mrs Arbogast I know it’s
Saturday but I need you to collect
all the data pertaining to Repulsor
Development over the past five

TONY
How long have you been selling us

JEREMY

stealing my ideas using my
technology to build God knows what

HAMMER
Your technology Your ideas If

My father’s money on the grounds
that I remain independent of SI

EXT FOREST WOODS -- NIGHT

The speeding STEEL VEHICLE RACES by Form the side it looks
like an unpainted test model for a new sports car FROM THE
FRONT The pursuing vehicle’s two-wheeled SIDES are held
together by interconnecting HOUSINGS like a catamaran

ANGLE ON The HEADLIGHTS over which two PANELS SLIDE OPEN
revealing slim modernized RIFLE HOUSINGS which EXTEND and
LOCK INTO PLACE FIRING a BLAZING STREAM of ULTRA HIGH-
VELOCITY LIGHT “BULLETS” at Tony’s Bugatti

WINDOW like a deli-slicer Tony WHIPS the car around trying
to avoid the murderous streams of gunfire Bethany FIRES her
PISTOL through the shattered rear window The bullets SNAP
and PING off the pursuit vehicle’s reinforced ARMOR

Tony glances at the SPEEDOMETER Just passing 100

TONY
Hang on

Tony hits the RACING BRAKES and WHIPS the Bugatti around A
SUDDEN TURN catching the attack vehicle unaware The metal
vehicle flies off the road directly INTO A THICK OAK TREE
There follows a series of EXPLOSIONS down the middle of the
“car” though most are EXPLOSIVE BOLTS LETTING GO AS --

The ATTACK VEHICLE SPLITS INTO TWO ARMORED CYCLES The
WHEELS FOLD UP as their REPULSOR ENGINES LAUNCH THEM INTO THE
AIR flying after the Bugatti like mad weaving dragonflies

TONY (cont’ d)

Turning radius

OVERHEAD ANGLE Tony TAKES A TURN sharp enough that if they
weren’t in a race-tuned super-car they’d both be dead The
CYCLES aren’t ready for the turn flying WIDE They CRASH
through the trees Fortunately for the FLYING CYCLES the
trees OPEN UP just then into a wide FIELD

OVERHEAD ANGLE ON THE FIELD as the deadly pair execute
WIDE flaming ARCS to bring them BLASTING back in pursuit

INT BJIGATTI -- NIGHT
Bethany gets a clear look into the side of one cycle

BETHANY
There’s nobody flying those things

TONY
There is By remote Let’s make
it tougher on them

Tony flicks off his lights getting into this

EXT WOODED ROAD - NIGHT

Tony ACCELERATES PAST 175 MPH The CYCLES pour on the speed
Repulsor-jets BLASTING guns BLAZING Tony PULLS THE PARKING
BRAKE WHIPPING the back end of the Bugatti around so that
they are HEAD TO HEAD with the onrushing CYCLES HURTLING
BACKWARDS Tony hits his HIGH BEAMS BLINDING THEM

The windshield BLOWS OUT under wild gunfire but Tony watches
out the back and at just the right moment he HITS THE GAS
TIRES SCREAM as they hurtle the car FORWARD AGAIN

The CYCLES however can’t stop like that Tony DARTS BETWEEN
THEM clearing their sight line -- TO REVEAL A STONE WALL
The Cycles SLAM INTO THE WALL with a double KA-WHAM

Tony SPINS the car again coming to a skid-stop with the
CLOUD OF DUST from the shattered stone wall billowing about
them -- One cycle has been reduced to wreckage The other
SPARKING and SHORTING RISES like a spitting demon

a
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 36

Tony FLOORS IT The car SMASHES INTO THE CYCLE lodging the
demolished thing into the wall The problem is the cycle’s
MACHINE LIGHT-GUN is now aimed down into the car

TONY
Get out get out

They DIVE out of their respective doors as the Cycle FIRES
WILDLY INTO THE BUGATTI in fury at its immobility Bethany
rolls over her shoulder and runs Tony gets to his feet
seeing SPARKS FLYING toward a pinprick SPRAY of GASOLINE

elements of melted shrapnel in and
around and throughout the left
ventricle of his heart which is
operating at around 30 percent
But without this Mast Outfit hed
live ten minutes Maybe

Bethany turns to find Rhodey at the door She is stunned
TRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 37

BETHANY
Rhodey

She hugs him They haven’t seen each other since school

DR SCHEFFER
Yes I know who he is

RHODEY
So why aren’t you putting a new
heart in the man We’re in his
father’s Wing for nepotism’s sake

SCHEFFER
I realize that but the nerve
damage is such that even if we
found a donor he’d never suvive
the transplant procedure

HOWARD STARK (0S)
Then you’111 think of something
else won’t you Doctor

The Doctor turns to HOWARD STARK in the door He pales
DOCTOR SCHEFFER

BETHANY
There were a few this morning A
couple of Press made it through

RHODEY
Least he got lots of flowers

BETHANY

Rhodey frowns He and Tony have their problems but a man

should not be alone and in pain isolated by his wealth

BETHANY (cont’ d)
Someone tried to kill us Rhodey
With his technology

Rhodey rubs his eyes Jesus

BETHANY (cont’ d)
Do you know anything about it

RHODEY
I saw Tony yesterday He came to
his dad’s house talking about how
SI had stolen his technology I
thought he was just angry at the
old man But I looked into it

BETHANY
And he was right

RHODEY
Stark Industries has detailed
analyses of Tony’s patents
They’ ve been licensed to a Stark
shell company called “Rising Dawn”

BETHANY
What kind of name is Rising Dawn

RHODEY
To me It sounds like a company
with plans for the future

Bethany glances toward Tony’s room
TRON MAN - HAYTER 2nd DRAFT 102104 39

BETHANY
Do you think Tony’s father might
have anything to do with this

RHODEY
(thinks)
No Never The old man’s
vindictive but he respects his
family name above all else

Someone else in the company maybe

sudden FLAT-LINE she RUNS the rest of the stairs to find
TONY sitting up in bed as Rhodey UNHOOKS his machines

Tony puts his feet to the floor gritting his teeth as the
Massive pain meets Tony Starks massive will

If a sundial qualifies as a clock

BETHANY
But the doctor said --
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 44

TONY
Doctors All we had to do was make
compares of my current heartbeat
versus the digital layout of my
heartbeat from the Space launch I
calibrated this Chest Plate to
detect irregularities in my heart
and compensate by electrically
stimulating the lagging muscle
response

BETHANY
You calibrated your own heartbeat

TONY
You know it was easy I just had
to read up on some biology

Rhodey slides back from the computer revealing a thin
elegant METAL EXOSKELETON both on-screen and ON THE DAIS

RHODEY
Okay Who’s up for some standing

ANGLE ON TONY’S LEGS now BRACED by the EXOSKELETON placing
his metal-banded FEET on the floor The tiny SERVOS in the
joints WHIR smoothly as Tony RISES TO HIS FEET

Boys this is truly impressive

Tony moves and flexes his body in perfect control

Howard stiffens He turns to look into the dark of the huge

his long coat hanging about him like a shroud

HOWARD STARK
Anthony my God Where’ve you been

TONY
To Hell and back

Tony sits painfully

HOWARD STARK
Youre weak son Let me call my
Doctor

TONY
No don’t Why did Kelner Smith
try to kill you Dad

HOWARD STARK
Kelner Kelner was unbalanced

TONY
Not when I knew him The man was
one of your most loyal servants

HOWARD STARK
Not loyal enough apparently

TONY
As your Chief Designer he must
have known you were stealing my
patents Obviously he was okay
with it I mean he built you a
whole facility full of weapons
right And then on opening day he
pulls a gun on you Why

HOWARD STARK
Maybe the pressures of this world
were too much for poor Kelner to
bear It’s happened to better men

TONY
Or maybe he knew what SI was
planning to do with those weapons
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 46

HOWARD STARK
Anthony -- You’ve been through a
lot But I don’t believe for a
second that you are rattled enough
to think I would ever dedicate my
Company’s resources toward anything
that wasn’t beneficial to my
Military partners or this country

Tony looks into his eyes searching for the truth He stands

TONY
You’re right I don’t think that
I think Hammer is betraying you

HOWARD STARK
That’s insane Justin has been at
my side for thirty years

TONY
Maybe he’s looking to move up
Does Stark International have any
warehouses in North Korea Dad

HOWARD STARK
That would be illegal

TONY
Even so there’s a warehouse near
the Chinese border full of weapons
developed from my designs Does
Hammer have the authority to
authorize something like that
without your knowledge

HOWARD STARK
(sighs)
Theoretically I suppose

TONY
This is a coup Dad Justin Hammer
is bent on driving a wedge between
us of toppling you and taking
Stark Industries for himself And
then armed with our family’s
money weapons and power God
knows what comes next

HOWARD STARK
You’re wrong Anthony Justin is
entirely loyal to me
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 47

TONY
Did he pressure you to steal
technology from me

HOWARD STARK
No I pressured him

TONY
Why

HOWARD STARK
BECAUSE YOU KEPT IT FROM ME - How
dare you boy You use your gifts
born of my line to develop
advanced technology And then take
steps to keep those advancements
from me Justin was right My
money founded you built you

TONY
Dad Someday youre going to
have to forgive me for mom’s death

Howard is taken aback by this new tack He looks down
TONY (cont’ d)
I came here to make this right
between us It’s gone too far
Hammer tried to kill us both

HOWARD STARK
That’s not true

TONY
It is true damn it He sent my

There have been many rumors

no definitive indication that he
was drunk at the time Second
while foul play has not been
proven it seems that my son was
physically removed from his
hospital room without my knowledge

JESSICA CAHILL
Mr Stark are you saying your son
was kidnapped By whom

HOWARD STARK
No-one is alleging a kidnapping
yet but our offices believe that
our head of Security James Rhodes
may have been involved

Until finally Howard Stark holds up a TREMBLING HAND

HOWARD STARK (contd)
Enough please Stop

Tony steps back truly shaken by this fight
HOWARD STARK (cont’d)
All my life All my work It
isn’t fair

TONY
It’s not about fairness dad It’s
about Physics

Through bloody teeth Howard Stark smiles

HOWARD STARK
I suppose you’re right
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 116

With that War Machine shows his final trick A HUGE MISSILE
UNFOLDS FROM HIS BACK The final weapon

TONY
No Dad NO You’1ll kill us both

Howard surveys the damage The RUINS of the STARK NAME

HOWARD STARK
It’s time Anthony It’s time
Look what happens in our footsteps

TONY
Don’t do it Dad -- I love you

HOWARD STARK
And I love you son With all my
heart

Howard CLENCHES his FIST FIRE BLASTS from the MISSILE on
his back BUT THE HOUSING IS CRIMPED The MISSILE is LOCKED
INTO PLACE Howard tries to turn his head

HOWARD STARK (cont’d)

What --
TONY
DAD
KA-WHAAMMMMMMM War Machine EXPLODES in BURST of LIGHT and

FORCE which BLOWS TONY ACROSS THE COMPLEX The WEAPONS
BUILDING EXPLODES CRUMBLING DOWN ON TOP OF HOWARD STARK

After the rubble has fallen silence Caught in the
Plant’s FENCING TONY raises his head

RISING ANGLE ON TONY battered and beaten getting shakily
to his feet Armor smoking badly now he walks footfalls
clanking on the tarmac Bethany’s body lies to one side the
crumbled concrete grave of Howard Stark on the other

He doesnt feel like a hero He feels destroyed

From the SHADOWS something MOVES Tony turns raising his
good arm at the gathered SECURITY GUARDS who now that the
fighting is over begin to emerge at a distance staring
Before see him clearly through the smoke Tony lifts
BETHANY’S BODY and TAKES OFF just a dwindling red star in
the night sky

FADE TO

MRS ARBOGAST
So here you are King at last
Was it worth it

Tony turns from the window of his PENTHOUSE OFFICE -- His
father’s former office but redecorated to Tony’s taste
Modern though not quite so party-oriented as the old jet
He wears an expensive charcoal SUIT He looks grown up

TONY
No

MRS ARBOGAST
Would you have done anything
differently

Tony really thinks about this

TONY
No I did what had to be done

MRS ARBOGAST
Then you should be proud of
yourself Like I am

She rises notebook in hand Professional again
MRS ARBOGAST (cont’d)
You’ re meeting with the Board in
ten minutes
TONY
Good I’ve got some things to say
to them

On her way out the door BANGS OPEN as RHODEY enters
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104

MRS ARBOGAST
Oh and your new VP of
Development has something that was
obviously too important to make an
appointment for

RHODEY
Sorry Mrs A But you’re right

INT STARK INDUSTRIES -- CEO’S OFFICE -- DAY

ANGLE ON A COMPUTER CHART showing a BOX labelled STARK
TRONWORKS in the center LINES EXTEND to FOUR OTHER BOXES

RHODEY
You asked me to trace the route of
your patents The ones that went
into your father’s weapons

programs

TONY
Right Those are the factories he
built them in -- North Korea

Sudan Egypt the Philippines So

RHODEY
Tony these are just the weapons
your father built

Tony’s stomach drops He leans in closer

TONY
What does that mean

RHODEY
Over the past seven years Stark
Industries has licenced your
patents to a whole network of Black
Market weapons designers they made
billions Tony

ON THE MONITOR MULTIPLE LINES spread out to over 100 BOXES
in areas around the world Ominous MUSIC begins to BUILD

RHODEY (contd)
There’s no telling what’s out
there

Tony pushes back the DESK BLOTTER revealing a NUMBERED
KEYPAD He enters a CODE BEHIND HIM The OFFICE WALL RISES

UP revealing the IRON MAN ARMOR in a METAL HOUSING ROOM
IRON MAN -- HAYTER 2nd DRAFT -- 102104 119

Tony hits the INTERCOM as the ARMOR SNAPS OPEN for him
TONY
Mrs Arbogast tell the Board I’ll
have to meet with them another
time

MRS ARBOGAST
Yes Mr Stark Is there a problem

Tony steps into the open Armor He meets Rhodey’s eyes

TONY
Yes Mrs Arbogast

CLOSE ON Tony’s face set and grim

TONY (cont’d)
