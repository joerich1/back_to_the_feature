---in order to form a more perfect
union establish justice insure
domestic tranquility provide for
the common defense promote the
general welfare and secure the
blessings of liberty to ourselves
and our posterity do ordain and
establish this Constitution for the
United States of America

genders sexual orientations and Land on JESSE KAPLAN --
one of those nondescript guys who fades from memory shortly
after meeting him Jesse wears a CHE GUEVARA T-SHIRT

HAMILTON (CONTD)
Our Founding Fathers didnt say to
form a perfect union but rather a
more perfect union And why
Because they had the foresight to
know that even their best attempts
would never create ultimate
perfection Yet it was important
to try regardless Was it perfect
No Is it perfect today No Is it
pretty darn close You bet it is
hats all we have time for today
Ive got your papers here

Hamilton begins handing out papers
I found them to be entertaining
informative and most of all

humbling Congratulations

Professor Hamiltons behind it

ARTHUR

clouding your judgement

JESSE

ARTHUR

reaches them and taps Hipster Dude on the shoulder

hardon when someone mentions

platonic admiration And you
think its easy being friends with
you Trying to get everyone to
like you all the time Bending over

are or what you stand for Frankly
its why youre a pussy

To err is human you arrogant piece
of shit

AGENT patrols the area Jesse waits a moment as he passes and
then SNEAKS his way behind and inside

INT BELL TOWER - MORNING

Jesse climbs up a steep staircase and reaches the top
exhausted He scans the small room which over looks the
campus At first he finds nothing Then he finds a LARGE
METAL BOX

Jesse opens the box and finds a RIFLE with a SCOPE

JESSE
Holy shit

Just then Jesse hears a LOUD ROAR from the crowds of people
on the campus below Some people are cheering others are
ooing

Jesse rises and looks through the window opening Below the
campus is bracing themselves for the arrival of the
President

Jesse PEERS through the scope of the rifle

SCOPE POV Scanning the crowd An angry protester from the

HAMILTON (CONTD)

HAMILTON
Youve done everything you were
supposed to do and now thanks to
the fact that you have your finger
prints all over this rifle youre
going to be the patsy who gets
blamed for killing the President

JESSE
Youre behind all this

HAMILTON
Yes Jesse Youve probably been
wonder Ing this whole time who the
a

hell is njay Patel The answer
is Me Or at least thats one
of my many many aliases

JESSE

But why are you doing this

HAMILTON
To disrupt the country To make it
weak To divide the United States
The right will blame the left the
left will blame the right and
independents will just blame you

JESSE
No one is going to believe that I
shot the President

HAMILTON
You kidding A kid who recently
found out his girlfriend was
sleeping with a Professor and who
was about to lose his scholarship
Theyll say you cracked that you
went over the edge And here

Hamilton tosses a book at Jesses feet Jesse picks it up

JESSE
The Catcher In The Rye
HAMILTON
Thatll keep them guessing for
years
JESSE
But I dont get it Whats the
point
HAMILTON

The point is it will cause disorder
and the more disorder there is the
more citizen turns on citizen the
more chaos and havoc the more Red
state versus Blue state and the
weaker this country gets And then
we sell the country off to the
highest bidder and nobody notices
because they re too busy screaming
partisan talking points at each
other on 24 hour Cable News
Networks

JESSE
Thats like thats bullshit man

HAMILTON
No Jesse its the oldest trick in
the book Its called divide and
conquer Now Im sorry to cut
this short but Ive got a
President to kill and Ive got to
pin it on you Im sorry things had
to end this way

Hamilton takes out PISTOL and points it Jesse

Jesse has struck Hamilton and knocked him to the ground
Hamiltons pistol falls down the stair case

They both SPOT the rifle laying on the floor pointing toward
Arthur Jesse and Hamilton lock eyes Knowing hes much
closer to the rifle Hamilton smiles mischievously

HAMILTON
(re rifle)
I dont think so Jesse

In that split second Jesse catches a glimpse out of the
corner of his eye -- THE AMERICAN FLAG waving next to him --
the one from the opening shot of the movie -- an idea hits
him

As Hamilton goes for the rifle Jesse reaches over grabs the
METAL ROD ATTACHED TO THE FLAG AND RIPS IT OFF OF THE SIDE OF
THE BELL TOWER

Hamilton GRABS the rifle and turns to shoot just as

Jesse SWINGS the American Flag attached to the metal rod (the
Flag Rod) down on Hamiltons hands KNOCKING the rifle out
of Hamiltons grasp and into the corner out of reach

Hamilton looks up at Jesse hovering over him Flag Rod poised
over his head ready to strike

yelling slogans and chants

He watches as no one is listening theyre all just
