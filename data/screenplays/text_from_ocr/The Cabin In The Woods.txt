INT BREAKROOM - MORNING

Steve HADLEY and Richard SITTERSON are workaday white
collar joes getting coffee and vending snacks as they
chat Hadley is blandly handsome Sitterson bordering on
nerdy but they have a sweet rapport

HADLEY
It’s hormonal I mean I don’t usually
fall back on you know “it’s women’s
issues”

SITTERSON
But child-proofed how Gates and stuff

HADLEY
No no dude -- she bought gates they’re
stacked up in the hall -- she did the
drawers Were not even sure this
fertility thing is gonna work and she’s
screwed in these little jobbies where you
can’t open the drawers

SITTERSON

At all

HADLEY
They oper like an inch then you gotwa
dig your fingers in and —- it’s a
nightmare

SITTERSON
Well I guess sooner or later --

HADLEY
Later She did the upper cabineta -- kid
won’t be able to reach those ‘til he’s
thirty Assuming you know kid

Hoisting files and in Sitterson’s case a small white
cooler -- the kind that might carry organs -- they exit
into

INT HALL - CONTINUOUS

It’s an anonymous concrete maze A few other workers
pass by as the men talk

SITTERSON
It’s a talisman It’s an offering
tact

HADLEY
Don’t even -- you have women’s issues
SITTERSON
Please You of all people

HADLEY
Me of no people It’s a jinx

Guarantees we won’t get pregnant and it
takes me twenty minutes to get a fucking

beer

Not the first time it’s come down to

that

SITTERSON

HADLEY

LIN
Its cutting it close
ee ne rire a

They turn a corner and find a row of golf carts at the

end of a long featureless hall The boys hop in

HADLEY
That’s why it’s in the hands of
professionals

SITTERSON
They hired Professionals what happens
to us

LIN
You guys better not be messing around in
there

SITTERSON
Does this mean youre not in the betting
Pool this year Big money

LIN
I’m just saying it’s a key scenario

HADLEY
I know what you’re saying ‘9g was the
chem departments fault and where do
you werk again Wait it’s coming back
to me

He peels out Sitterson trying not to spill his coffee

We stay with them

HADLEY (CONT’D)
Gonna be a long weekend if everybodys

CURT
Think fast

CURT Vaughan is Jules’s boyfriend and yes that’s a
letterman jacket he’s wearing and yes that’s a football

CURT (CONT ’D)
Well faster than that

JULES

Dana moves to look out the window is in time to see

ANGLE DOWN ON THE STREET

Curt’s friend HOLDEN McCrea rushes into the street and
catches the ball a Slowing car bumping his leg It’s an
impressive catch

In mock weep she flees the room Curt holds the first
book up to Dana

CURT (
Seriously Professor Bennett covers this
whole book in his lectures

(MORE )

Neer
Read the Gurovsky it’s way more
interesting and Bennett doesn’t know it
by heart so hell think youre
insightful And you have no pants

He tosses the books back on the bed calling out to

CURT (CONTD)
Holden Crazy mad skills of catching

Dana Panicked hoists her jeans on heading out after
Curt into

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jules is opening the door for Holden and he’s even
better looking up close Less of a wild man than curt

HOLDEN
You laid it in my hands I did but hold
them out

He tosses it back to Curt ang grabs his weekend duffle
bag entering

Ss

HOLDEN

JULES
(pleased)
Thats a first

CURT
Dude this is Dana

DANA
Hey

HOLDEN

(shakes her hand)
Holden Really nice to meet you and
thank you guys for letting me crash your
weekend I°1) just put a disclaimer up
front you don’t have to explain any of
your in-jokes 1°1) Probably be drunk
and think theyre funny anyway Should r
have left out the part about being drunk

CURT
With hindsight yeah
HOLDEN
Damn Can I help anybody carry anything

EXT STREET OUTSIDE - A BIT LATER

Holden is dumping Jules’s last suitcase (she has
overpacked) into the RAMBLER the trailer Curt owns with
the dirt-bike attached to the rear Dana’s inside takes
it from him (polite smile between them) as he turns back
to Jules and a bag-laden Curt

HOLDEN
That pretty much it

CURT
Fuckin’ better be Jules it’s a
weekend not an evacuation

JULES
Truet me when I say there is nothing in
those cases you wont be glad I brought

CURT ()
I’m shuttin’ right up ay

DANA
(looking off)
Oh my gad

ANGLE A CAR has just finished parking Martin “MARTY”
Mikalski is getting out of the drivers seat while
smoking a huge bong It’s difficult to maneuver but
definitely not his first time

His friends inatantly look around for oh say police

JULES
Marty

CURT
Fuck is wrong with you bro

MARTY
People in this town drive in a very
counterintuitive manner and that’s what
I have to say

CURT
Do you want to Spend the weekend in jail
‘cause wed all like to check out my
cousin’s country home and not get boned ( 5
in the ass by a huge skinhead 3

JULES
Marty honey that’s not okay

MARTY
Statistical fact cops will never pull
over a man with a huge bong in his car
Why They fear this Man They know he
sees farther than they and he will bind
them with ancient logics
(staring at Jules’s hair)
Have you gone grey

CURT
You’re not bringing that thing in the
rambler

MARTY
A giant bong in your father’s van

He pours the water out Removes the bowl sticks it in a
little holder inside the tube and telescopes the entire
thing down pulls a lid off the bottom and pops it on the
top making it look exactly like a can of Fresca

MARTY (CONT’D)
What are you staned

oa As Holden raises his eyebrows and Jules rolls her eyes
Marty hops in calling out

MARTY (CONTD)
(from inside van)
Dana You fetching minx Do you have
any food

INTEXT VAN - A BIT LATER

The key is turned the gas stepped on Curt looks in the
rear view at his peeps

CURT
Everybody ready

General assent

CURT (CONTD)
Then let’s get this show on the road

ANGLE FROM UP HIGH we see the rambler rolling off into
the distance The camera arms up to watch it go the
side of the building in frame
oe Mm

It reaches the roof and

Pans over as we find a group of

six men in Clean Room Suits standing silently After a
beat one speaks into hig earpiece

CLEAN MAN

Nest is empty

A beat then he circles

» we are right on time

his finger in the air scrambling

the men to pick up cases and head for the door to the

stairwell

CLEAN MAN (CONT ’D)

vault-sized but impressive)

counter)

HADLEY
He will also answer to “Honey Toes” Are

TRUMAN

HADLEY

Sitterson)

TRUMAN

SITTERSON

(from off camera)
It wasnt funny last time either

Hadley is shrugging hitting a bank of switches on the
wall that audibly powers up the control room He crosses
to his chair and starts flipping switches there as well

A SETS

»

Sitterson is already entering data into a computer
locking and testing knobs and levers

Sitterson rolls to another bank of controls flips the
cover off a row of buttons

SITTERSON(CONT’D)
Let’s light this candle boys up is go
on your command

The screens all come to white blank life their light
brightening the dim room

EXT RAMBLER — DAY
It trucks along an old road nothing but brush visible

INT RAMBLER — CONTINUOUS

The gang is in mid-ride clearly a couple hours in Curt

is still driving Jules riding shotgun is checking
both a map and the GPs Marty sits at the little table (2
cautiously rolling an elegant filtered row of joints
Dana sits with him Holden in the bathroom with the doox

open where we can see theyve stashed a keg He’s

filling three cups

JULES
I hope this is the right road ‘cause
right now it looks like the only road

CURT
What about that thing we crossed back
there

JULES
Doesn’t even show on the GPS It’s
unworthy of global positioning

DANA
It must feel horrible

MARTY
That’s the whole point Get off the
grid No cellphone reception no
markers no traffic cameras go
somewhere for one goddamn weekend where
they can’t globally position my ass
This is the whole issue
Holden brings up beers for Cu
smiles at him shyly

JULES
(heard this before)
Is society crumbling Marty

MARTY
Society is binding It’s filling in the
cracks with concrete No cracks to slip
through Everything is recorded filed
blogged chips in our kids so they don’t
get lost -- society needs to crumble
Were all too chickenshit to let it

JULES
I’ve missed your rants

He grins at her holds up a gorgeous joint

MARTY
You will come to see things my way

JULES
I can’t wait Is that the secret stash

MARTY
The aecret secret stash I havent told
my other stash about it because it would
become jealous

DANA
(pointing ahead)
A sign Up there

JULES
(turns back)
Yes And okay left Bear left

CURT

DANA

Id take it as a favor
CURT

Gas

They all look ahead

CURT(CONT’D)

Gas And maybe someone who knows where
we actually are

EXTINT GAS STATION

It is as decrepit and abandoned looking as it can be an
old pump squats in front of a monument to rust windows
clouded with grime

ANGLE FROM INSIDE through the windows we see the
vambler pull up The inside of this Place doesn’t look
any more inviting than the outside Once upon a time
things were fixed and goods were sold in here but not of
late

The kids pile out stretching looking about Curt and
Marty examine the pump

CURT
I’m thinking this thing doesn’t take
eredit cards

MARTY
I don’t think it knows about money I
think it’s barter gas
Curt moves a pace to see if anyone is around

ANGLE HOLDEN is inside moving slowly toward the back
We hear Curt’s offscreen

CURT
Hello

But no reply Holden keeps walking tracing his finger
along the countertop

CLOSE ON HIS FINGER trailing a line of clear glass into
the grime

HOLDEN
We also wanted to get directions

CURT
Yeah were looking for

JULES
(coming forward)
Tillerman Road Do you know if it’s this

The attendant looks at her the name registering She
kind of wriggles under his gaze

ATTENDANT
(mutters)
What a waste

He starts ambling toward the pump pulling out a ring of
keys and unlocking a latch

ATTENDANT (CONTD)

The attendant sticks the nozzle in the rambler’s gas
tank The numbers on the pump start going up manually
(like they used to back when) but creak to a stop almost
immediately

CURT
(to the attendant)
My cousin bought a house up there you go
through a mountain tunnel there’s a
lake would that be

ATTENDANT
Buckner place Always someone looking to
sell that plot
(bad bad smile)
Always some fool looking to buy

JULES
You knew the original owners

ATTENDANT
(flaring up)
You know damn well which war

She takes a step back freaked Dana takes her arm

MARTY
Would that have been with the blue and
some in grey Brother perhaps fighting
against brother in that war

ATTENDANT
You sassin’ me boy

MARTY
You were rude to my friend

The attendant stops for a second not expecting this guy
to have come back at him Glances at Jules mutters

ATTENDANT
That whore

Curt is about to clock him but Holden puts a hand to
Curt’s chest steps forward

HOLDEN
I think weve got enough gas

ATTENDANT
Enough to get you there Gettin’ back’s
your own concern

He pulls out the nozzle as the gang moves back in curt
contemptuously throwing a twenty at the guy’s feet

MARTY
Good luck with your business TI know the
railroad’s comin’ through here any day
now gonna be big Streets paved with

ANGLE THE RAMBLERS TIRE

Spins in the sand and takes the heap right out of there
cruising down the road

The attendant watches spits chaw Watches

EXT WOODS - Day

A helicopter shot floats over the rambler as it winds
through an endlaus expanse of firs finally consumed by
them

EXT MOUNTAIN TUNNEL -— AFTERNOON

The Rambler comes up the side of a steep drop-off We
see Jules in the passenger seat smiling

JULES
Guys take a look

And we pan with the vehicle as it enters the mountain
tunnel slowing down a bit - it’s a tight fit The
camera moves up the mountainside looking down to see the
rambler come out the other end

A bird comea from behind camera flying directly above
the tunnel About halfway across it hits an invisible
barrier and falls in a shower of sparks as for one moment
an electrical grid seems to appear where it struck
before Sparking away into nothing
ae

sous

EXT CABININTVAN - AFTERNOON

Theres no audio but music as the kids all crowd the
front of the van to look at their vacation spot The
lake appears up ahead sun rippling over the water and
they look and point talking a bit

Finally the camera races through the forest and finds the
cabin It squats uninvitingly a fairly ramshackle -—-
though not overly rustic -- single story structure
Windows on either side of the door not unlike closed
eyes

The van pulls up and the kids come out more slowly than
they did at the gas station taking it in Danas a
little entranced Holden curious Curt pumped Jules
mildly excited Marty wary

JULES
Oh my god it’s beautiful
(to Curt sotto voce)
One spider and Im Sleeping in the
Rambler I mean it Uno spider-o

MARTY
(to himself)
This house is talking a blue streak

As the boys start unloading the keg Dana approaches the
front door slewly turns the knob

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She enters the living room It’s also if you turn to
the right the kitchen the stove is a Classic old wood-
burning Kalamazoo Wonder the sink clearly retro-fitted
The decor is sparse and antlery A wolfs head is
mounted on one wall

A hall goes own the middle with two bedrooms on either
side Dana makes her way around the room as the rest of
the gang pours in

CURT
Oh this is awesome

JULES
It is kinda cool you gonna kill us a
raccoon to eat

CURT
(nodding)
I will use its skin to make a cap

Jules runs down to thé hall to look in the rooms
grabbing a doorknob —
JULES
Dibs on whichever room is -- ow
She pulls her finger back -- it’s cut slightly on the
tip a little blood welling up
JULES (CONT’D)
Curt your cousin’s house attacked me
CURT
I smell lawsuit
HOLDEN
When was your last tetanus shot
JULES
Thanks that’s very comforting
CURT
Jules is pre-med she knows there’s no
coming back from thia
(stroking her hair)
I’11 miss you baby I’11 miss your
shiny new hair
Dana looks over at Marty who stands in the doorway
looking around warily
DANA
Marty Are you Planning on coming in
He looks around not ready to make his move
INT HOLDEN’S ROOM - AFTERNOON
Holden throws his bag on his bed which squeaks
appallingly He looks around the decrepit -- but not
entirely un-homey -- room focusses on a picture opposite

the bed

ANGLE THE PICTURE is like 19th century print but it’s
of a hunting Party with machetes and dogs tearing a lamb
to pieces and upon close examination is repulsive

HOLDEN
Yeah I don’t think 30
re eet

He takes the picture off the wall camera follows him as
he leans it on the floor comes back up to find Dana
staring at him blankly through a hole in the wall once
again he jumps

HOLDEN (CONT’D)
Wow I’ve heard about the walls being
thin but --

She bares her teeth at him He stops not getting whats
going on at all then as she starts picking between them
he gets it Moves forward and puts his hand to the one-
way mirror between then

HOLDEN (CONT’D)
No way

He watches her for a bit first amused then a little
hypnotised She really is kind of beautiful She mussesa
her hair a little gives up grinning at her own vanity
Moves to her bed and starts unbuttoning her shirt
HOLDEN (CONTD)
Oh shit ah no ahh

He bobs back and forth between this golden Opportunity
and commen human (yawn) decency Moves away from the
hole out of frame Moves back

Finally bangs on the wall ducking his head just as she’s
about to take it off —-

HOLDEN (CONTD)
(calls through)
Hold up
INT HOLDEN’S ROOMHALLDANA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
The gang is all in there checking it out

JULES
You have got to be kidding me

DANA
That’s just creepy

MARTY
It was pioneer days people had to make
their own interrogation rooms out of
cornmeal

‘2

CJ

HOLDEN
(touches the edge)
This from the seventies judging by
the weathering Who did your cousin buy
this place from

CURT
We should check the rest of the rooms
Make sure this is the only one

(to Jules)
You know Marty wants to watch us pounding
away
MARTY
(wincing)

I didn’t even like hearing that

JULES
(as they exit)
Dont be an ape Curt

He makes ape noises off screen Dana is still staring at
the glass

HOLDEN
How about we switch
(she turns to him)
Not that Id I mean I’1l put the
picture back but you might feel better if
we switched rooms

DANA
I really would

He grabs his bag and they head out as she says

DANA (CONTD)
Thanks for being decent

HOLDEN
Least I could do since Curt and Jules
have sold you to me for marriage

She makes cringe face

DANA
They’re not subtle

HOLDEN
I’m just here to relax And so can you

DANA
Yeah I’m not looking for But I’m
still grateful that you’re not a creep
on rt

HOLDEN
Hey let’s not jump to any conclusions
there I had kind of an internal debate
about showing you the mirror Shouting
on both sides blood was spilled

In her (now his) room he dumps his stuff and she grabs
hers

DANA
So youre bleeding internally

HOLDEN
Pretty bad

DANA
Well Jules is the doctor-in-training
You should probably talk to her

HOLDEN
Yeah

Dana exits clearly frustrated with her lame exit line
She enters her new room and dropping her luggage moves
to put the picture back She’s stopped by the aight of

iden also looking a littla fruatrated A moment and
he pulls his shirt over hig head He’s in pretty good
shape Ha pulls his bathing suit out of hia bag starts
unbuttoning his pants —-

DANA
Uhhh ah God

Sheepishly she grabs the picture and replaces it Takes
a moment to look at the slaughtered lamb scene

DANA (CONT’D)
Yeah I don’t think go

We cut to a high and wide of her placing a little blanket
over the picture and suddenly the frame is that ofa
monitor as we pull back to see

EXT DOCK - DAY

Footsteps ring out as Dana and Holden race down the
wooden dock They’re both in their swimsuits running at
top speed As they reach the end they dive into the
lake --

DANA
(as she emerges from the
water)
OH Cold Thats what Cold feels like --

HOLDEN
Fight through the pain It’s worth it
I’m nearly convinced it’s worth it

Reverse on Curt Jules and Marty (all also in swimwear
except Marty who at least has bare feet and rolled-up
pants) as they casually walk down the dock —-

S)

Viewer

JULES
(to Dana and Holden)
Does it seem fresh Lotta funky diseases
sitting in stagnant lake water

DANA
What This water
(takes a gulp of the lake
water)
This water’s delicious

HOLDEN
Oh my god she’s right --
(cups it into his mouth)
It tastes like vitamins And hope

DANA
Cmon Jules -- life is risk

JULES
Yeah I might just risk lying out in the
sun for a while

Curt steps to the edge of the dock face falling as he
looks into the water --

CURT
What ia that
DANA
What
CURT
In the lake I swear to god I
DANA
Yeah right
CURT
(scared)

No seriously Right there Don’t you

He puts his hand on Jules back --

CURT (CONT’D)
My girlfriend

And with that he shoves Jules straight into the lake
Splash

JULES
(as she surfaces)
Oh Oh my god I’m gonna kill you

Curt points at another part of the lake --
CURT
Look -- theres something else in the
lake --

He jumps out right where he was pointing -- SPLASH -- as
he surfaces --

CURT (CONT’D)
It’s a gorgeous man
JULES
(swimming over to him)
You are go dead --

He laughs as she tries to dunk him --

CURT
Don’t kill the gorgeous man They’re

endangered
Dana laughs looks up at Marty -- (
DANA S
Marty -- get in here --
MARTY
Nah man I’m cool Just seeing the

sighta

He sits down on the edge of the dock dangles his feet in
the water Leans back High as the proverbial kite --

MARTY (CONT’D)
Just seeing the sights
And with that we cuT WIDE ON THE LAKE On the horizon
the sun is just staring to set We HOLD ON THIS TABLEAU
as the kids splash and laugh and frolic in the lake

For a moment all is right with the world

INT CONTROL ROOM

WHUMP A large wad of CASH slams down onto the console
Widen to reveal Sitterson -- for some reason he’s holding
large wads of cash As he steps up onto the console --

SITTERSON
Last chance to post C’mon people dig ( s
deep Betting windows are about to oe

close
(i ca SoD SITS

The room is bustling with activity Several people are
clustered around Hadley thrusting papers and cash in his
face everybody talking over each other --

HADLEY
(to Sitterson)
Who’s still out

Sitterson looks at his clipboard --

SITTERSON
I got Engineering I got RandD I got
Electrical --

HADLEY
Did you see who they picked They’re
Practically giving their money away

SITTERSON
Yeah you’re one to talk Aquaman

A TECHNICIAN in a labcoat hands her form to Sitterson
As he looks at it --

SITTERSON (CONT ’D)
I’m not even sure we have one of these

TECHNICIAN
Zoology swears we do

SITTERSON
(shrugs takes her money )
Well they’d know

Across the room A YOUNG GUY who looks a lot like an
INTERN hands his form to Hadley --

HADLEY
(xe form)
No no -- theyve already been picked

INTERN
(angry)
What Who took ‘em

HADLEY
Maintenance

INTERN
Maintenance They pick the same thing
every year

HADLEY
What do you want from me If they were
creative they wouldn’t be in
Maintenance If you win you’re gonna
have to split it You wanna switch

INTERN
(thinks then)
Nah Leave it I got a feeling on this
one

Lin is off to the side where Truman stands at attention
stoically watching the Proceedings

LIN
Not betting

TRUMAN
Not for me thanks

LIN
Seems a little harsh doesn’t it It’s
just people letting off steam

(looks at Hadley and ( )
Sitterson) i
This job isn’t eaay however those clowns
3 may behave
TRUMAN

Does The Director do they know about
it downstairs

HADLEY
(joining them)
The Director doesn’t concern himself with
stuff like this Long as everything goes
smoothly upstairs and the kids do what
they’re told

TRUMAN
But then it’s fixed
(off their looks)
How can you wager on this when you
control the outcome

Hadley glances up at the monitors ON THE SCREENS -- we
see Dana Holden Jules Curt and Marty crossing through
the cabin heading towards the living room

HADLEY
No no We just get ‘em to the cellar
Truman They take it from there (
E
ae

Sagal

SITTERSON
They have to make the choice of their own
free will Otherwise system doesn’t
work Like the harbinger creepy old
fuck practically wears a sign saying “you
WILL DIE” why would we put him there
The system They have to choose to
ignore him They have to choose what
happens in the cellar Yeah we rig the
game as much as we have to but in the
end if they don’t transgress

Hadley counts the money --

HADLEY
ethey can’t be punished Last chance
Truman Windows closing

TRUMAN
I’m fine

HADLEY
(yells to the crowd)
All right That’s it gang The board
is locked

He hands the rest of the money to Sitterson who slams it
on the pile with the rest of the cash

SITTERSON

(looking at screens)
Let’s get this party started

INT CABIN - LIVING ROOM — NIGHT

Curt pumps the keg sprays beer into a plastic cup as
Jules puts on a song --

CURT
Let’s get this party started

He hands the beer to Jules who dances through frame in
time to the music pumping out of the stereo

HOLDEN
Oh I’ve played before -—- I don’t really
get the third part

DANA
Well that’s our own thing

JULES
It takes it to a whole new level
HOLDEN
Okay whose turn Marty Truth or Dare
or Lecture

MARTY
I could go for a lecture

HOLDEN
(the pressure’s on)
Perfect Lecture

MARTY
Wait hang on --

He a grabs a joint lights it and takes a massive hit
But he doesn’t exhale He just looks at Holden -- all
right bring it on

HOLDEN
(lecture mode)
Marty Mikalski you are squandering
your potential

Marty nods -- true

HOLDEN (Conr’D)

Youve anesthetized yourself to the
outsida world you’re hiding in a womb
made of reefer It’s time you “gave
birth” to the real Marty

(to the others into it)
I think he’ll find theres more to life
than getting high

Marty exhales a huge cloud of smoke as the group

applauds

MARTY
(genuine)
Thank you for opening my eyes to whatever
it was you just said
(then)
Jules Truth or Dare or Lecture

JULES
Let’s go dare

MARTY
All right
(thinks)
I dare you to make out with --

CURT

(

ot MUM a OY

o

MARTY
-- that moose over there

Everyone turns looks to where he’s pointing MOUNTED on
THE WALL is the large snarling WOLF’S HEAD For the
record it couldnt look less like a moose

DANA
Um Marty have you seen a moose
before

MARTY
Whatever that mysterious beast is --

CURT HOLDEN
It’s a wolf Yeah it’s a wolf

MARTY (CONT’D)
I’m living in a womb of reefer leave me
alone
(then)
Jules I dare you to make out with the
wolf

Jules nods takes a drink hops to her feet

JULES
No problem

The group cheera As Jules makes her way across the
cabin she drops her hips a bit adding a sultry swagger
to her step

WOLF’S POV Were looking out at the cabin as Jules
walks right by us And just as she’s about to exit
frame she stops in her tracks Looks over at us

She glances over her shoulder Bashful Looks back at
us wolf points to her chest

JULES (CONTD)
Who Me

(pretends to listen then)
I am new in town how did you know

Everyone laughs cheering her on But Jules pretends
they’re not even there —— it’s just her and the wolf

She blushes twirls her hair around her finger --

JULES (CONTD)
(to the wolf)
Oh my god that is so sweet of you to
say I just colored it in fact
(MORE )

JULES (CONT’D)
(then)
Yes Id love a drink thank you

She steps towards the wolf then acts like she trips --

JULES (CONT’D)
Whoops --
(looks towards the ground)
I seem to have dropped my birth control
pills all over the ground

While the group hoots and hollers Jules turns around
bends over right in front of the wolf Pretends like
she’s picking something from the ground

Then without turning around she stands up straight so
that the wolf is now directly over her shoulder She
nuzzles it cheek to cheek --

JULES (CONT’D)
Oh Mr Wolf Youre go big And bad
(then)
No no no -- there’s no need to huff and

puff
She turns around takes the wolfs head in her hands --

JULES (CONT’D)
I’1l let you come in

And with that Jules leans in and gives the wolf the most
passionate kiss weve ever geen She just goes for it --
full-on tongue-to-taxidermied-wolf-tongue action

The group loses their minds Everyone leaps to their
feet giving Jules a standing ovation

Jules looks to the group takes a bow even as she makes a
face spitting out stuffed-wolftaste As she walks back
to the group Curt hands Jules her beer the others keep
applauding --

HOLDEN
I didn’t know it was possible but I
think you just officially won Truth or
Dare

DANA
Or Lecture

HOLDEN
Sorry

oa
Vie

JULES
The night is still young Now then
Dana --

CURT
(bored)
“Truth”

Dana frowns Glances at Curt --
DANA
What’s that supposed to mean

CURT
I’m just skipping ahead
(to explain)

then youll puss out and say you wanted

DANA
(studies him)
Really

CURT
(meds )
Or “Leature”

DANA
No I wouldn’t want one of those

ANGLE MARTY -- he’s glancing at curt Frowning
Something about all this seems a little off

And Dana seems to notice it too But she’s not about to
let Curt get under her skin --

DANA (CONTD)
Okay Jules
(defiant)
Dare

And just then behind her -- WH-WHAM -- the cellar door
blows open Everyone screams startled
JULES
What the hell was that

They all look back at the now-open hole in the floor Ag
they move toward it —-

DANA
It’s the cellar door
a

MARTY
I thought it was locked

CURT
The wind must have blown it open

JULES
What wind

They all cluster around the hole A set of stairs leads
down into the foreboding darkness The group stares down
at it all a little spooked --

HOLDEN
What do you think’s down there

(shrugs)

Why don’t we find out
(then)

Dana

Dana glances up at her What

JULES (CONT’D)
I dare you to go down into the cellar

3 And we’re CLOSE ON DANA as she tries not to show just how

much that scares her OFF HER LOOK --

INT CELLAR

Crrreak Dana cautiously makes her way down the old
wooden staircase It’s dark Dana’s flashlight barely
illuminates three feet in front of her

She reaches the landing Tries to keep her voice steady
as she calls back to the others --

DANA
How long do I have to stay down here

CURT (OS)
Oh you know just ‘til morning

She stands at the base of the stairs trains the
flashlight beam around the room Curiosity getting the
better of her she steps into the darkness

Creak

The flashlight beam scans the room catching a glint of ie
metal - OLD RUSTY TOOLS hang from hooks along the walls

Creak

Dana keeps moving heart pounding in her chest Her
flashlight sweeps the area finding a dusty old RECORD
PLAYER a CHILDS TOY CHEST a dressmaker’s
MANNEQUIN

Dana turns beam sweeping across the wall As it does
so it finds --

A GHOSTLY FACE

Staring right at her Dana screams nearly jumps out of
her skin --

HOLDEN Dana

As footsteps ring out from above Dana angles the light
back towards the face realizes -—

It’s a PORTRAIT A daguerrotype to be precise of a
young woman roughly fifteen dressed in turn of the
century garb She stares back at Dana with sad eyes

HOLDEN (CONT’D)

You okay
Dana turns to find Holden racing down the stairs the
others right behind him
DANA
Yeah Sorry I just --
(embarrassed)

I just scared myself It was stupid

CURT
You called for help voids the dare
Take your top off

Marty strikes a match lights an OLD OIL LANTERN hanging
from the wall As orange light spills across the room

HOLDEN
Oh my god

they get a full view of THE CELLAR The room is big --
much bigger than we expected -- and every dark corner
seems to be filled with creepy clutter

JULES
Look at all this
4l

MARTY
Uh guys Im not sure it’s awesome to be
down here

But the others aren’t even listening to him They spread
out each focusing on a different Part of the cellar --

Holden looks down at a variety of CHILD’S TOYS scattered
across the floor He picks up an ORNATE MUSIC BOX

HOLDEN
Dude seriously -- your cousin’s into
some weird shit

Curt has picked up a CONCH when he sees a WOODEN SPHERE
sitting behind it He puts the conch down and hoists the
sphere It almost looks like a small globe it’s s0
ornately carved but it has dusty brass rings inlaid
around it -- it can be turned and adjusted almost like a
spherical Rubik’s cube

CURT
Yeah pretty sure this ain’t his Maybe
the people who put in that window

Dana can’t take her eyes off the portrait of the girl

On the vanity below it she notices a variety of personal
effects an old hairbrush a silver mirror and a
leather-bound BOOK

DANA
Some of this stuff looks really old

Jules studies the dressmaker’s Mannequin AN AMULET
hangs around its neck Jules touches it

JULES
(almost to herself)
It’s beautiful

MARTY
Maybe we should go back upstairs
(then)
I dare you all to go upstairs

But even Marty can’t help but be intrigued as he spots an
OLD SUPER-8 PROJECTOR He finds a film reel starts
unspooling it

HAUNTING MUSIC fills the air as Holden starts winding the
crank on the music box

Curt starts turning the sphere parts -- they seem to be
lining up

()

Sian”
emt HE

Dana brushes the dust off the book revealing the word
“DIARY” on the cover

Jules takes the amulet off the mannequin holds it up to
her neck looks for the clasp -- as though she were about
to try it on

Marty holds the film strip up to the light frowns as he
tries to discern what’s on it

As Holden continues to wind the crank the music BUILDS
and BUILDS He’s staring down at the box-lid -- it’s as
though something’s about to pop right out of it and
just as the music’s about to reach crescendo --

DANA
Guys

Holden stops winding the crank The world goes quiet
Everyone looks up from what theyre doing

DANA (CONT’D)
Guys listen to this

Reluctantly each person puts down the object of his or
her attention and moves towards Dana

DANA (CONT’D)
(reads from di
“Today we felled the old birch tree out
back I was sorrowed to see it go as
Judah and I had sat up in its branches so
many summers”

What is that

Dana looks in the inside cover

DANA

Diary of Patience Buckner 1903
CURT

Wow
JULES

DANA

“Father was cross with me and said I
lacked the true faith He did not give

DANA (CONTD)
I wish I could prove my devotion as
Judah and Matthew proved on those
travellers”

MARTY
Uh that makes what kind of sense

HOLDEN
You know it’s uncommon that a girl out
here was reading and writing in that era

DANA
(reads)

Mama screamed most of the night 1
prayed that she might find faith but she
only stopped when papa cut her belly and
stuffed the coals in”

looking at everyone Nobody comments

Bewildered she flips ahead continues

DANA (CONT’D)

(reads)
“Judah told me in my dream that Matthew (
took him to the Dark Room so I know he is
killed Matthews faith is too great

even Father does not cross him or speak

of Judah I want to understand the glory

of the pain like Matthew but cutting the

flesh makes him have a husbands bulge

and I do not get like that”

MARTY
Jesus can we not

CURT
Go on

MARTY
Why

CURT
Suck it up or bail pothead I wanna
know

Dana looks around Holden gives her a little nod

DANA
(reads)
“I have found it In daddy’s oldest
books that I will burn before I go is
the way of saving our family For no one ( ‘
truly dies who understands the Great

Pain

DANA (CONTD)

I can hear Matthew in the Dark Room
working upon father’s jaw My good arm
is hacked up and et so I hope this will
be readable that a believer will come
and speak this to our spirits Then we
will be restored our love will be
unending and the Great Pain will
return”

(looks up)
And there’s something in Latin

MARTY
Okay I am drawing a line in the fucking
sand here do not read the Latin

A small voice seems to whisk across the top of the room
barely audible

VOICE
Read it

Marty is the only one who seems to hear it He looks
around

The fuck

VOICE
Read it out loud

Marty starts across the room as Dana appears to be about
to start Curt plants a hand in his chest and shoves him
back

CURT
Fucking baby

JULES

It doesn’t even mean anything Look

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

As her voice continues to echo on the soundtrack a
gnarled and grey hand digs its way out of the ground
holding a rusty blade

They come out one by one in various Parts of the woods
a group of hastily buried and not all that decomposed
zombies five of them all in 1900s farm clothes all
holding various appalling farm implements

These are the Buckners FATHER with his scythe MOTHER
with her broken saw skinny JUDAH with his thin
sharpened trowel enormous MATTHEW (we don’t see his
weapon yet) and little one-armed PATIENCE holding a
hatchet

Patience is the first to move ambling toward the distant
light of the cabin

INT CONTROL ROOM

OM THE MAIN VIEWSCREEN -- we see the image of the ZOMBIE
FAMILY slowly making their way towards the cabin

SITTERSON We have a winner

Widen to reveal a HUGE CROWD has filled the control room
Everyone’s watching the large viewscreen intently

SITTERSON (CONT’D)
It’s the Buckners ladies and gentlemen
Buckners pull the “Wi”

Most of the crowd GROANS in disappointment throws their
betting slips to the ground But a few BLUE-COLLAR GUYS
throw their arms up in triumph --

SITTERSON (CONT’D)
(looks over at the wall)
Looks like congratulations go to
Maintenance

And as he says that we see behind him

A LARGE WHITE-BOARD against the wall Written in marker
down one column there’s a long list of MONSTERS A few
words jump out at us “VAMPIRES” “WEREWOLVES ” “FLOATING
WITCHES” “ALIENS” “ZOMBIES” “KEVIN” “CLOWNS ”
“WRAITHS ” “SCARECROWS” “ANGRY MOLESTING TREE”
“MUTANTS”

“ease”

Down another column a corresponding list of DEPARTMENTS
“ELECTRICAL” “ENGINEERING” “SECURITY “ “ZOOLOGY” and so
forth

SITTERSON (CONT’D)
(continuing)
who split the pot with Ronald the
Intern

Hadley hands an enormous wad of cash to the BLUE-COLLAR
GUYS and another wad to the happy INTERN we saw earlier

People shake their heads begin to file out of the room
A WIRY GIRL approaches Sitterson on her way out --

WIRY GIRL
That‘s not fair f had zombies too

SITTERSON
Yes you had “Zombies” But this is
“Zombie Redneck Torture Family”

Sitterson taps the board There it is right there
“ZOMBIE REDNECK TORTURE FAMILY” Right next to
“MAINTENANCE” and “RONALD THE INTERN”

SITTERSON (CONT ’D)
Entirely separate thing It’s like the
difference between an elephant and an
elephant seal

Her shoulders slump Knows he’s right As she goes

SITTERSON (CONT ’D)
There‘s always next year

Truman stares at the screens at the shambling Buckners
corpse-clan

TRUMAN
Theyre like something from a
nightmare

LIN
No they’re something that nightmares are
from Everything in our Stable ig a
remnant of the old world courtesy of

LIN

TRUMAN
(turning to her)

Sitterson walks over to Hadley Hes just standing
there staring up at the screens Looking a little

despondent -

SITTERSON
I’m sorry man

HADLEY
(can’t believe his bad luck)
He had the conch in his hands

SITTERSON

I know Couple more minutes who knows
what would have happened

HADLEY
(frustrated)
I’m never gonna get to see a merman

SITTERSON
Dude be thankful Those things are
terrifying And the cleanup on them’s a
nightmare

Hadley nods -- I suppose you’re right He gestures
towards the screens

HADLEY
So the Buckners huh

SITTERSON
I know
(watches the screens)
Well they may be zombified pain-
worshipping backwoods idiots but

HADLEY
They’re our zombified pain-worshipping
backwoods idiots

SITTERSON

and they have a hundred Percent

Hadley nods good point As they start walking back
towards their console —

the rest of the weekend off

SITTERSON
Yeah right They’re Japanese What are
they gonna do -- relax

HADLEY
I don’t know Maybe they can do some
group calisthenics or something

And as Sitterson and Hadley clear frame we HOLD ON ONE
OF THE MONITORS

ON THE SCREEN we see a video feed of a JAPANESE SCHOOL
ROOM Several schoolchildren run screaming in terror
from a SOPPING WET YOUNG GIRL who’s floating through the
air like she’s hanging from an invisible noose As the
children SCREAM and SCREAM the WET GIRL floats TOWARDS
US and we CUT To --

InT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The msia is blaring and Jules is dancing up a storm

Curt ia going with it occasionally getting behind her
for the butt—cupping dance but she’s all over the yoom --
really working it Pops a couple of buttons to show more
cleavage

Everyone else is sitting Dana and Holden on the couch
Dana still holding the book and Marty slumped in
armchair smoking sullenly

Jules dances over in front of Holden and does a little
impromptu lap-dance wriggle for him He looks a little
awkward glancing at Dana who isn’t exactly thrilled

CURT
Go baby oh yeah that’s the goods
right there fuck yeah

MARTY
This is so classy

CURT
Like you wouldn’t want a piece of that

MARTY
Can we not talk about people in pieces
anymore tonight

JULES
(kittenish turning)
Oh are you feeling lonely Marty

She moves to him gives him a little wriggle action as
she takes his joint and sucks hard

JULES (CONT’D)
Marty and I were sweeties on our freshman
hall

MARTY
(to the others)
We made out once I never did buy that
ring

JULES
(pouty)
But we’re still
(blows the smoke in hia face)
» close

MARTY
You know I have a theory about all this ( 2
CURT
‘ 3 Thats our cue to bail Tommy Chong has
2 a theory

(indicating Holden
You can tell it to Egghead here if he’s
not too busy devirginizing Dana

Dana stands dropping the book on the couch

DANA
Jules do you want to lie down

CURT
That’s exactly the point
(pushes Jules to the door)
Mush Mush

JULES
(not upset)
Dont push me around

CURT
Not around baby straight line Right
there Out there Pretty stars

They exit as Dana crosses to get another beer and Holden
flips through the book Marty hoists himself up and (
joins her still smoking ss
rag

MARTY
Do you seriously believe that nothing
weird is going on

DANA
(wryly)
A conspiracy

MARTY
The way everybodys acting

DANA
I’m sorry about downstairs --

MARTY

It’s cool it’s not —- when does Curt

couch with a beer for herself and Holden He takes his
still holding the book

little

JULES

They’z suddenly on three huge screens being shot with a
remote catiera on a long lens with fifteen workers low in
frame watching them intentiy

CURT

He pulls the shirt open but she takes a step back and
holds it together

JULES

A groan throughout the crowd cause Hadley to stand up
from the control area behind them

HADLEY

As they are herded out by Truman Hadley sits saying to

HADLEY (CONT’D)

He types fast on a keyboard uses a touch-screen
thermometer gage to raise the heat

Hadley is working his own controls

HADLEY
Okay Engaging the pheromone mists

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

AT THEIR FEET we actually see wisps of fog rise from the
ground

Jules still holding her shirt together closes her eyes

and takes a deep breath through her nose She opens her (
eyes looking at Curt with half-lidded lust He goes in -
for another kisa and she wraps her arms around him

pulling off his shirt As he trieg to arch her down to

the ground her laet sleepy protest

JULES
It’s so dark Im gonna get twig-butt

CURT

He starts to turn her pulling her open shirt away from
her neck and kissing it from behind

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Before the kids a tiny glen of moss and soft green
fronds suddenly seems to glow in the moonlight It
couldn’t be more inviting

Jules smiles dizzy with lust

ANGLE GROUND LEVEL -- Jules drops down into frame Curt
on her the two of them only about the business They
roll over Jules on top sliding her hand down Curt’s
pants -- he moans with longing running his hand up her
chest over her bra

INT CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The men watch the screens hands at the ready to
manipulate any dial They have the dispassionate focus
of porn theater patrons

HADLEY
(quietly)
Okay boobies boobies

SITTERSON
Show us the goods

Truman looks over at them a little disturbed

TRUMAN
Does it really matter if we see --

HADLEY
(not looking around)
We’re not the only ones watching kid

SITTERSON
Got to keep the customer satisfied
(does turn)
You understand what’s at stake here

TRUMAN
(nodding)
Sorry
Sitterson turns back to the screens and the two men
watch their handiwork
INT CONTROL ROOMEXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

And now we cut back and forth a bit
55 i)

Curt kneeling slides Julea’s pants off His head comes
back into frame and takes the edge of her panties in his
mouth making a little growl as he lets go and it snaps
back on her waist --

Jules laughs leaning her head back and suddenly not
laughing breathing hard

Hadley and Sitterson stare (looking perhaps directly
into camera to make us even less comfortable)

Jules swings on top and pulls her shirt off at last She
takes her time sliding her hands up her belly to her
breasts finally to the clasp in the middle of her bra

She pops it open holding it together coyly for one
moment before pulling the bra off revealing her breasts
a sheen of sweat (and the fact that they’re not fake)
making them all the more enticing She smiles knowingly
a vision of hedonistic perfection

Curt looks up at her in silent wonder

All three men in the control room -- including Truman --
look at her the exact same way As Curt slides his hand over her ehest she leans down
into him his arms coming around her back

HADLEY
Score

SITTERSON
Eat that Stockholm

He makes a small tweak on a dial eyes still on the
screen

ANGLE ABOVE THE LOVERS the camera comes softly down
towards them the tableau romantic and sensual Hes

atop her and a bit to the side one hand (out of frame)
working under her panties as she moans arms out

CLOSE ON HER HAND running along the soft moss
A rusty trowel nails it to the earth

Jules SCREAMS rearing up --- hampered by the hand that
wont move as Curt tumbles off her looking up to see

Three zombies (as they will be called from now on) are
attacking them

Skinny JUDAH is crouching over Jules pulling his trowel
out even as MOTHER reaches around her neck with her
snaggle-toothed saw MATTHEW the biggest is still a
few feet behind ambling towards

CLOSE ON THE MOTHERS BELLY as three burning coals flop
out of a slit in it sizzling on Jules’s hair and the
moss

She starts to draw the saw along Jules’s neck and Curt
snaps out of it He piledrives right into Mother --

CURT
Fuck away from her

-- knocking her back on her ass He turns to Judah just
as Judah digs the trowel into his arm Curt howls
trying to pull it out as Jules holds her bleeding neck
trying to rise but weak

Curt pulls his arm away bringing Judah towards him and
then punches Judah hard right in the nose The nose
breaks easily crumbling a bit Judah completely unfazed
by it Curt looks over towards the third zombie

Matthew stands a few feet away leaning slightly
Suddenly he lets a chain slide through his fingers all
the way to the ground pulled by a broken bear-trap just
a rusty metal jaw with teeth a turn-of-the-century mace
and chain

Matthew grins

The trap swings with sudden speed whacking Curt’s head
(luckily not with the jagged side) and knocking him back
bleeding and dazed

JULES
Curt

She tries to rise and Matthew swings again digging the
claw of the trap into her back She SCREAMS arching
back and flopping face-down onto the ground digging her
fingers into the earth as Matthew drags her backwards

Curt stumbles up -- and Father is behind him slipping
the shaft of hia scythe over Curt’s head and pulling it
back hard against Curt’s throat Curt thrashes unable
to scream as his feet are pulled off the ground He
sees

The screaming pleading whimpering Jules is kept in
place by Matthew’s foot as he yanks out the trap
erm ct

Judah pulls her hair back holding up her head -- her
eyes on Curt’s -- as Mother places the broken blade once
more at her throat Curt watches in silent horror

Inside the control room the men are equally silent
Truman trying hard not to lose it as Jules’s pleas fill
the air around

CLOSE ON JULES’S PLEADING EYES as we hear the horrible
scrape of the saw tearing flesh

No sound in the console at all save scraping and
shuffling Truman has his eyes closed Hadley and
Sitterson both have lowered their heads and Sitterson
quietly intones

SITTERSON
This we offer in humility and fear for
the blessed peace of your eternal
slumber As it ever was

HADLEY
As it ever was

Sitterson pulla a short necklace from under his shirt

On it is a weird pagan symbol five pointed but not a
pentagram He kisses it and replaces it under his shirt
as Hadley crosses behind him to a series of five mahogany
panels at the far end of the room

He opens the first and presses an ornate brass lever
down

CLOSE ON A MECHANISM almost like an old clock Jules
Verne-esque A small hammer strikes a vial that cracks
dark red blood pouring out into a brass funnel that runs
down a thin pipe seemingly a very long way

INT THE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

The pipe ends in the ceiling of a dark room we wont
really see just yet The blood pours out onto a leaning
Slab of dark marble right into a groove at the top The
blood races down the groove as it bends and arcs
different ways forming a primitive picture of some sort
-- though of what we do not yet see

EXT WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Judah hisses at us

()
cn eee nt ct

Drop wide to see Curt has stopped struggling Father
still holding him as Judah and Mother amble toward him
Matthew is bent over Jules’s corpse but we cant see
what he’s doing thankfully

As they raise their blades Curt springs into action
planting his feet on both of them and pushing as hard as
he can knocking them back -- and Father as well Curt
rolling over him and pulling himself free

Gasping for breath Curt scrambles on hands and knees
back towards the cabin almost on his feet -- and the
blade of Fathers scythe slices through the cuff of his
jeans pulling his leg and dropping him back to earth

INT MARTY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Marty is lying in bed on his back as he reads Curious

Dana and Holden are leaning in for a kiss when Marty
strides by making them stop

MARTY
He’s got a husband bulge

They look at each other awkwardly the moment broken
Marty shuts the door behind him

EXT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

We walk out with Marty leaving the house behind He
comes out about thirty yards near the first trees In
medium close-up he looks up

MARTY
I thought there’d be stars
(sighs)
We are abandoned

And he starts to take a Piss All of which is held at
this close angle so we only hear it

There’s a noise in the woods behind He turna around to
see a copse of trees but no movement Turns back and in
the BG one of the trees turns out to be a figure -- a
silhouetted girl with only one arm holding a hatchet

She makes her way slowly toward him now lit by the side

window of the house now lost in the dark in front of it

Marty zips up turns again - and Curt attacks him from

right beside Camera yelling and scaring the shit out of

No -- wait --

Dana reaches for the front door Starts to open it

MARTY

DANA

eand she swings the door open revealing -- ( 2
MATTHEW “

He’s atanding on the porch framed in the doorwa - Just
staring at us Holding something round down by his side
He tosses it right at Dana -- she gasps catches it
looks down to see --

It’s Jules’ HEAD

Dana screams her heart out She drops Jules’ head on the
ground glances up as Matthew steps up the porch She
screams and screams as Matthew approaches -- Holden dives
forward slams the door shut just as --

WHAM Matthew slams into it The frame shakes the wood
splinters Marty races forward helps Holden brace the
door As they slam the deadbolt into place --

Curt flips the couch over tries to shove it against the
door Looks up at Dana who’s still in shock —-

CURT

Dana snaps out of it helps curt shove the couch under
the doorknob WHAM The whole cabin seems to shake as
Matthew slams into it -- ( and

(glances at Marty)
More of them

MARTY

I saw a young girl -- all zombied like
him And “Little House on the Prairie”

Dana’s face falls as she realizes --

DANA
Oh god Patience
(glances at Holden)
The diary --

HOLDEN
“The pain outlives the flesh”
(thinks about it)
She must have bound a mystical
incantation into the text so someone
would come along read the diary aloud
and

DANA

(quietly)
And I did it

CURT
(to Holden)
Look brainiac -- I don’t give a limp

stares at the surveillance images of Curt and the others
moving through the cabin Sitterson’s right beside him

Clickety-clack -- he hits some keys throwa a switch --

Curt’s hair ripples Blightly as he’s hit by a guest of air
from a Nearby HEATING VENT He stops in his tracks
looking slightly confused --

DANA
What’s the matter

He glances around looking slightly befuddled Shakes
his head --

CURT
(almost to himself)
This isn’t right

He looks at the others almost like he doesnt trust them

CURT (CONTD)
This isn’t right We should split up
We can cover more ground that way

And now Dana and Holden look a little hazily paranoid as
well They think about it nod --

HOLDEN

CRASH Just then the living room window EXPLODES
INWARD Our group cries out in surprise looks back to
see MATTHEWS ARM now reaching through the window --

frowning --something about this isn’t quite right But
then he shakes it off hurries after them

door behind him Again he frowns -- Huh That’s
weird But before he has time to consider it fully --

WHAM The cabin shakes again We hear glass breaking in
another room Marty snaps out of it —- stick to the
plan He races to the window which is wide open --

As he dives for it pulling it shut he loses his
balance knocks over the end table next to his bed --

CRASH A lamp SHATTERS on the ground Marty glances
down at the fragments Sees something

ON THE FLOOR -- a thin black wire snakes through the
shards of glass Marty picks it up sees theres
actually a small fiber optic CAMERA at the end of it --

length of the wall Stares up at the ceiling We see
the realization hit him --

MARTY
Oh my god I’m on a reality show
(then)
My parents are gonna think I’m such a

burnout --

CRASH Just then the window behind Marty EXPLODES
INWARD -- Judah reaches through grabs Marty by the neck
yanks him backward THROUGH THE WINDOW —-

Marty screams as Judah tries to pull him out of the
cabin Marty struggles mightily -- he holds fast to the
window frame desperate to get back inside --

J
Nae

Judah growls yanks Marty again As Marty starts to lose
his grip on the window he flails about his free hand
searching the nearby dresser top for anything he can use
as a weapon --

And just as Judah yanks him one last time Marty’s
fingers close around the FRESCA CAN --—

EXT CABIN - CONTINUOUS

Judah hauls Marty straight out of the cabin window --
WHAM -- Marty slams into the ground -- he gasps in pain
looks up just in time to see --

Judah plunging THE TROWEL down straight at Marty’s head
Marty rolls to the side —- THUNK -- as Judah buries the
trowel into the ground next to him --

Marty struggles to his feet but Judah’s right on top of
him As Marty tries to fight him off he glances down at
the Fresca can in his hand He gives it a shake --—

C1-CLACK -- and it telescopes outward into the GIANT
BONG Marty takes the makeshift baton swings it with
all his might --

WHAM He hits Judah flush in tha side of the head
dropping him to the ground with a sickening thud

Marty stares down at Judahs crumpled body but Judahs
only momentarily dazed he’s already starting to get to
his feet Marty doesn’t hesitate any longer he bolts

towards the forest --—

But as Marty races away at top speed Judah takes the
trowel in hand --

And hurls it right at Marty’s back

Wh-CHUNK Bullseye -- he hits Marty right between the
shoulder blades Marty cries out in pain as he pitches
forward crashes to the ground

Judah slowly walks towards the fallen Marty

ON THE GROUND -- Marty gasps in pain tears in his eyes
as he desperately struggles to get the trowel out of his
back He reaches behind him -- his fingers touch the
hilt but they can’t find purchase

Judah grabs Marty by the leg Starts dragging him into
the forest -

No -- NOOOO ---

EXT FOREST - CONTINUOUS

-- and we’re WITH MARTY as Judah drags him through the
treeline Theyre heading towards a DARK HOLE in the
ground (from which Judah first emerged) Marty tries to
struggle -- blood seeps from the wound in his back
leaving a bloody trail through the dirt

Marty’s fading fast He coughs blood tears stream down
his face --

No -- HELP ME --

And as Judah drags him down into the hole we STAY UP
TOP -- Marty struggles with everything he’s got -- his
TERRIFIED EYES stare back at us as he screams and
screams -- his fingers claw trails in the dirt around him
as he tries to hang on --

MARTY (CONT ’D)

But it’s no use And with a final yank Marty disappears
from view entirely His horrified screams echo through
the forest

And then he’s gone

through the carved stone etchings And as it flows
outward we slowly PULL BACK to reveal the picture forming

Suddenly the rumbling fills the room which starts to
shake with what feels like a decent sized earthquake

they too are shaking Hadley is returning from the

SITTERSON
Greatest Show on Earth

INT DANA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The rumbling subsides and she turns her attention hack to
the dresser As she gets it in place she hears the
window shatter and the chest beging to rock She shoves
the bed against it and goes for the door

It won’t open she pulls kicks but it’s locked solid
She’s staring at it confused -- it looks so flimsy --
when the chest goes over and a zombie starts climbing in
She hits it with a lamp but it has no effect

She sees a second one coming backs up against the wall --
and the picture on it goes flying glass shattering
making her jump

Holden knocks out the rest of the one-way mirror
There’s banging in his room but no zombies in yet

HOLDEN
My door’s stuck
DANA
Mine too
He looks at her sitch -- worse than his own -- and

beckons her to come through

HOLDEN
Come on
o

She stands on the bed and wriggles through with his
help but not without some cuts and they both fall to
the floor

Theyre still rising when the furniture Holden has piled
up is knocked away -- By Matthew

DANA
The bed

They upend it and shove it at the window holding its
metal frame against the pounding from without Dana
looks around for something else sees

ANGLE UNDER THE BEDSPACE is a trapdoor

He looks puts his shoulder to the bed to take the weight
as he indicates for her to check it out She moves to it
and pulls it open -- nothing but blackness below She

looks back at Holden
DANA (CONT’D) (2

Better or worse

He sticks his foot out and slides a lamp to her It’s
been set on the floor (during the furniture pile-up) but
still plugged in She lowers it into the dark space
lets it hang by its plug

DANA (CONT’D)
It’s empty

Holden gives the bed one last kick in place and moves to
the door calling out

Holden moves to the edge of the space takes a quick look

in and goes in head first holding the edge and flipping
himself over to land on his feet Dana slips down into
his upstretched arms right after disappearing into the
hole

INT DARK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

It’s strangely quiet as though it swallowed the noise
from above The only light is from the dangling lamp
and it throws the whole small room into a creepy half-
light And creepy seems to be the general theme

It’s a torture chamber with a chair chains shackles

and a table with some truly appalling instruments rusting

on it Sweeney Todd would get squeamish in here
They look around a bit unwittingly fascinated

DANA
This is the Dark Room

catching under his arm and digging into the back of his
shoulder He SCREAMS as Matthew starts hoisting him up

through the trap-door (3

Dana runa to him and helps him struggle finally
overbalancaing Matthew who falls forward stuck upside
down halfway through the trap-door still grabbing at
Holden on the floor

Holden painfully pulls the trap from his shoulder -- but
Matthew gets a hold of him his mouth wide in a hissing
scream -

DANA
You like pain

Dana runs the crowbar right through Matthew’s face and
into the wall behind pinning him Screams in his face

DANA (CONT’D)

Matthew grabs the bar and pulls at it -- Holden getting
free -- and Dana finds a kitchen knife stabs Matthew

WSSSHLICK - A SCYTHE tears through Holden’s throat fron
behind

Blood splatters the windshield -- Dana SCREAMS -- she
glances hack to see -

FATHER BUCKNER

He’s right behind them having crept up from his hiding
place in the Rambler He growls as he tries to dislodge
his scythe from Holden’s throat -- SHLOCK -- he pulls it
free -- arterial blood Sprays everywhere all over Dana ——

-Dana continues to scream and scream as Holden’s hands

instinctively clutch at his own throat -- the steering
wheel spins unchecked —-

WH-SHLACK -- Father Buckner swings the scythe again this
time lodging it in the side of Holdens head Holden
pitches forward the Rambler careens out of control

Right into the lake

SMASH The front windshield SHATTERS —- lake water comes
rushing into the cab blasting Dana straight back into
her seat --

Beside her Holden continues to THRASH -- he’s still
alive -- Father Buckner yanks the scythe free tries to
swing it again but the water blasts him back to the rear
of the Rambler --

Lake water fills the cab -- within a matter of seconds
they’re completely submerged -- we’re with Dana as she
screams goes under --

And everything goes quiet

Dana struggles underwater panic in her eyes as she looks
over and sees Holden staring back at her He’s still
holding his throat -- blood pours from his wounds --

Dana fights to free herself from the seatbelt —- she
shakes her head CRIES ouT underwater as she holds
Holden’s gaze --

And WE’RE CLOSE ON HOLDEN as the life drains out of him
As he stares at Dana his hands go slack blood gushes
from his throat clouding the water around him until he
disappears entirely

WIDE ON THE LAKE as the rest of the Rambler sinks below
the surface disappearing entirely from view

INT RAMBLERLAKE — NIGHT

We’re WITH DANA as the Rambler continues to sink the van
now perpendicular as it plummets straight down She
tumbles upward into the ceiling towards the back

Her hands reach out for anything desperate to find
purchase Her eyes dart upward falling on --

The CEILING HATCH

It’s small -- a basic ventilation hatch no more than a
foot-and-a-half Square -- but now’s not the time to be
picky

There’s a little bubble of air trapped in there and Dana
shoves her face in it gasps it greedily It disappears
as she does and she pulls her head back holding her
breath again --

CLOSE ON FATHER smiling in the dark water He doesn’t
need to hold his breath

Dana reaches out grabs the crank spins it around As
the hatch swings open she punches out the screen
squeezes her body through the hole And just as she gets
about halfway through --

she’s stuck half-in half-out of a sinking van with a
deranged zombie yanking at her legs She thrashes with
everything she’s got left —-— kicking him as hard as she
can in the face -- WHACK knocking him back

She breaks free rockets upward out of the hatch towards
the surface Beneath her the van disappears into the
inky darkness of the lake below Dana kicks for the
surface closer closer --

EXT DOCK - NIGHT

Elegiac MUSIC starts to swell on the score Dana grabs
hold of the wooden dock -- it takes every ounce of
strength she’s got left to pyli herself up out of the
lake She rolls on her back gasps for air

As she lays there staring up at tha stars the score
continues to swell She gasps and gasps and were
CLOSE ON HER as the realization finally hits her —-

Shes alive

She made it She closes her eyes thank god -- r’m

bloody Clearly Matthews been kicking the hell out of

backwards right off the dock — SPLASH -- into the lake

further like a storm door on top sod and leaves
Underneath smooth clean metal

Looking apprehensive Dana slides in and Marty SLAMS the

We stay outside looking down holding on the door in the

it’s Judahs mewling face Hes been completely

He goes to the door in the floor and slides it open She
looks down it’s a small metal elevator Two sides are
thick glass but they are up against the metal shaft so
tight you might not even tell

MARTY (CONTD)
It’s an elevator Somebody sent these
dead fucks up to get us There’s no
controls inside but theres maintenance
overrides in there been playing
around I think I can make it go down

Marty sees
A staring man in a long leather futuristic coat Hes

in deep He is grinning at Marty and holding a flowing

things killing andor feeding than looking for prey

the eye -- and are almost to the turn when they hear an
unbelievable screech

Fae Sos dxagonbat launch itself right at
guard station They bolt turning

AA gered sor “ into a labcoat guy who passes them

through the wall

The dragonbat pulls him back eating his entrails and
Dana looks at the hole in the wall There is a stone
corridor beyond different than any of the rest of this
Place Older

Marty is watching the corridor -- a couple of flesh-
eating Zombies are slowly coming toward them -- and Dana
grabs his arm pulls him into the stone corridor and down

at
SND VARIOUS
And more carnage

ANGLE A CLOWN taking bullet hit after bullet hit as it
lumbers forward knife in hand

ANGLE A WEREWOLF tearing out a man’s throat with its
teeth as in the background a unicorn slams its horn
repeatedly into the guard up against a wall blood
spurting on its lovely unicorn mane

INT CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The door is off its hinges smoke filling the dark room
The SCARECROW FOLK have almost overpowered Truman their

knife-fingers twitching as he shoots them to no avail He
pulls out a grenade

x

HADLEY
Running out of time

SITTERSON
Its on emergency lockdown I’m
bypassing

Truman’s grenade explosion knocks Hadley off the edge and
into the main space lost in the smoke

LIN
Hadley

SITTERSON
I’m close I’m close I’m close --

ANGLE HADLEY is on his back dazed when he hears
something slurping toward him in the smoke He looks to
see the MERMAN black fin and dorsal like a whale black
soaking hair black eyes -- everything else ag white as
his razor-sharp teeth He puts a webbed hand on Hadley’s
throat as Hadley realizes he’s about to be killed by a
merman --

HADLEY
Oh come on

And it bites his face off

ANGLE SITTERSGN AND LIN are concentrating on the
trapdoor we hear a ‘ping’ --

SITTERSON
Got it

Sitterson swings the heavy stone door up as a tentacle
wraps around Lin and whips her up out of frame
Sitterson dives into the hole and pulls the door shut
over him

INT HIDDEN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
Sitterson races down a ladder and around the corner --
and right into Dana’s trowel He looks at her confused

by the blade in hig chest She looks stricken

He sees Marty coming up behind her turns to her as he
sinks

SITTERSON
Please kill him

And dies at her feet trowel still in him
oar

MARTY
Come on We have to find a way out
before everything else finds a way in

She’s looking down at Sitterson

MARTY (CONT’D)
Dana

She looks up at him He holds out the gun

MARTY (CONTD)
Here It’s easier with this

She takes the gun and does seem to gain some measure of
calm from it Starts down the hall -- and down a long
stone staircase taking point gun held out

INT THE CHAMBER CONTINUOUS

Marty and Dana enter quickly Dana holding the gun the
camera circling them as they turn looking at the five
stone slabs then arming Up to see they’re standing on a
mosaic of the symbol Sitterson wore

Exrept at the stairs the edges of the stone don’t reach
the wall The two of them look over the edge to see a
space of maybe four feet across that goes all the way
down into darkness But there is the sense of something
moving in that darkness The kids draw back from it

MARTY
No way out

DANA
Look at these
(turning slowly)
Five of them

MARTY
What are they

DANA
Us

A whirring sound accompanies a spill of light as a small
circular hatch opens in the center of the mosaic and up
comes THE DIRECTOR (kind of like Luke in “Empire” when he
enters the cryogenic chamber to fight Vader)

He is older distinguished wearing a black suit grey
shirt no collar no tie and grey gloves Hes calm
almost affectionate

THE DIRECTOR
That’s quite right

DANA
(to Marty)
I shouldve seen it like you did ail of
this the old guy at the gas station the
out of control behavior the monsters
this is part of a ritual

THE DIRECTOR
The oldest

DANA
No it’s simple They don’t just wanna
see us killed They want to gee ug
punished

MARTY
Punished for what

THE DIRECTOR
(shrugging)
For baing young It’s different for
every culture And it changes over the
years but it’s very specific There
must be at least five

THE DIRECTOR (CONT ’D)
The Whore

DANA
(mutters)
That word

THE DIRECTOR
She is corrupted she dies first
(pointing to the other
carvings)
The Athlete The Scholar The Fool All
suffer and die at the hands of the
horror they have raised Leaving the
last to live or die as fate decides
(MORE)

He points to one of the carvings it’s a woman Standing
erect holding open her robe her naked body revealed
oem NASER

102

THE DIRECTOR (CONTD)
(points to the last slab
looks at Dana)
The Virgin

DANA
(snorts)
Me Virgin

MARTY
Dude she’s a homewrecker

THE DIRECTOR
We work with what we have

MARTY
What happens if you don’t pull it off

THE DIRECTOR
They awaken

DANA
Who does Whats beneath us

THE DIRECTOR
The gods The sleeping gods the giants
that live in the earth that used to rule
it They fought for a billion years and
now they sleep In every gountry for
every culture there is a god to appease
As long as one sleeps they all do But
the other rituals have all failed

There is a great rumbling -- they all stagger a bit and
silt siftsa down from the ceiling As it subsides

THE DIRECTOR (CONT ’D)
The sun will rise in eight minutes
(to Marty)
If you live to see it the world will
end

Neither of them questions the truth of it They stare at
him a moment

MARTY
Maybe that’s the way it ought to be
Maybe it’s time for a change

THE DIRECTOR
Were not talking about change Were
talking about the agonizing death of
every human soul on the planet

3 (to Marthe

O

THE DIRECTOR (CONTD)
Including you You can die with them or
you can die for them

MARTY
Gosh they’re both so enticing

He looks over to Dana to see that she is pointing the gun
at hin

MARTY (CONTD)

Wow
DANA
Marty The whole world
THE DIRECTOR
(to Dana)
There is no other way You have to be
strong
MARTY
Yeah Dana You feeling strong
DANA
I’m sorry
MARTY
So am I

A werewolf leapa at her from the stairs and tears into
her The gun goes flying as she falls to the ground
trying to pull the beast off her

The Director and Marty both move for the gun and
struggle themselves but Marty finally gets hold of it —-
knocking The Director to the floor - and without
hesitation puts three bullets into the werewolf sending
it screeching back up the stairs

Dana rolls over eyes wild blood everywhere The
Director rises and tackles Marty They wrestle on the
floor the gun just out of reach the edge of the abyss
by their heads

As they fight Dana breathes heavily by the stairs
unable to rise She looks over as two small feet shamble
by her in old dirty shoes the edge of a tattered
gingham dress swinging above the ankles

Marty gets on top of The Director and pushes his forearm
against his windpipe His back is to the girl

DANA
Marty
an a ane ORE

104 (2

He turns -- The Director grabs the gun -- and Marty spins
The Director on top of him just as Patience swings her
hatchet burying it in the back of the Directors skull

Another tremor and Marty kicks The Director over the edge
of the circle Patience unwilling to let go her
hatchet goes over with him

Marty watches them a moment then limps over to the
stairs

Another bigger tremor makes him Pause but it subsides
and he slumps in the Corner next to Dana Shes
breathing shallow tears streaming from her eyes but
she’s pretty alert

MARTY
Hey
DANA
You know I don’t think Curt even

has a cousin

MARTY
Huh How are you

DANA
Going away

MARTY

om
baw

Im sorry

DANA
I’m 80 sorry I almost shot you If
Probably wouldn’t have

MARTY
Hey shh no I totally get it

As he continues he lights up a joint

MARTY (CONT’D)
I’m sorry I let you get attacked by a
werewolf and then ended the world

He takes a drag and holds it out to her With a shakey
hand she takes it and drags on it herself

DANA
Nahh you were right Humanity
(blows out smoke in a cynical
‘Pfft’) a
Its time to give Someone else a chance

MAR’
Giant evil gods
DANA
Wish I coulda seen ‘em

MARTY
“I know That would be a fun weekend

Biggest rumble yet The floor starts bulging cracking
as dust and debris cloud the screen

Dana holds out her hand Marty puts his in it Squeezes
it They hold a moment

An explosion of debris from below obliterates the
chamber

EXT CABIN - DAWN

We are wide on the cabin as gnarled hand bigger than
the house and on an arm a hundred feet long shoots up
from the crust of the earth

BLACK OUT
