OVER BLACK The SOUND of gun barrels being loaded and cocked

This story either happened or it didnt I should know
because I lived every moment though if asked Ill deny it
Ill say this a gambler who wins fifty-two and a quarter
percent of the time is killing it Beat the line cover the
juice walk with cash But for a whale its like eating a
minnow Doesnt even pay to swallow I averaged over seventy
percent I was never officially a mobster I didnt use a
gun I just had a head for numbers but with it I could kill
Then and now with just my mind I could kill IRISH

INT HELLS KITCHEN - APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bob Dylan KNOCKIN ON HEAVENS DOOR
SUPER Back in the day

A weeks worth of dishes fills the sink of the low rent digs
At the table is BILLY LOGAN 50s as Irish as the Whiskey
hes drinking Three days of stubble covers his battle worn
face a US Navy tatoo on his arm marks his pride

A HARD KNOCK at the door-- Billys lips kiss the bottle Swig
after swig as the KNOCKS GET LOUDER He clenches the bottle
until the next KNOCK BUSTS DOWN THE DOOR

TWO MEN in winter coats covered by clear plastic slickers
storm the kitchen MAN 1 places a GUN against Billys
temple We get the sense its not the booze that keeps Billy
from trembling its that hes been here many times before

MAN 1
Wheres our fucking money

The HAMMER cocked Billy downs the last drop of whiskey
wiping his lips then flipping both men one last fuck you

MAN 2
Fuck this Mick

THE SHOOTER closes the last SNAP on his plastic rain slicker

SUDDENLY -- A STORAGE CLOSET DOOR OPENS -- BULLETS FLY from
within filling the unsuspecting bodies of the two men

Billy falls to the floor just as MAN 1s GUN FIRES-- missing
his temple by a hair the bullet lodging into the wall

DANNY LOGAN 16 lanky street tough emerges with TWO GUNS
still BLAZING their chambers emptying into the already dead
The clear rain slickers now blood splattered from inside out
CHARLIE (VO)
The devil greeted everyone with a
smile but only the Irish survived
beyond the gates of Hells Kitchen
The reason alone is a tale worth
telling But thats another story

Danny trembles over the blood soaked as Billy pries the
smoking guns from his hands then turns over the first body

Billy pulls GOLD NYPD DETECTIVES SHIELDS from each of the
dead mens belts then hands the prize to his son Danny

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Five Families controlled New York

Billy tosses his sons murder weapons and the cops revolvers
into a paper bag then Danny tosses in the shields

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
The Westies controlled Hell

As Danny reaches to take the BAG from his father we see
TATTOOED across DANNY AND BILLYS fists-- WESTIES

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
My father and his father were
Westies

BILLY LOGAN
Into the river as far as you can
throw Now get--
DANNY bolts-- BILLY looks down at the dead detectives

DISSOLVE TO

EXT STATEN ISLAND FERRY - NIGHT
SUPER About a dozen years later
The ferry moves across the pitch black waters of New York

Bay RAIN pounds its deck like a symphony of machine-gun
fire A black sky looms-- the devils restless for a soul

A LONE FIGURE stands soaked in fear along the starboard side
Cold air escapes his lungs like smoke billowing from a
chimney His hands grip the rail-- as a man would to life

CHARLIE (VO)
Money will make people do things
theyd otherwise never imagine

Out of the darkness a MAN in a BLACK BRIM HAT appears
BULLETS OF RAIN kill the sound of their conversation A
HENCHMAN suddenly appears His size now blocking our view

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Desperation is a devils market

ANGLE ON the starboard side of the ferrys hull In the
blackness the LONE FIGURE now DANGLES over the rail His
sole lifeline-- the Henchmans hand wrapped around his wrist

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Give your soul to save another or
sell out theirs to save your own

The man in the hat watches the lone figure beg for his life
his body bangs against the hull the bay reaches to swallow

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Whats your life worth I mean--
whats it really worth

INT CAESARS PALACE - NIGHT
Frank Sinatra COME FLY WITH ME
SUPER Caesars Palace Las Vegas - June 1983

COLD HARD CASH shoots through a casinos currency
discrimination counter like bullets through a Gatling Gun

CHARLIE (VO)
I know what youre thinking-- Look
at all that cash just waiting to
be won Every sucker thinks that
way Its all so intoxicating that
as the devil devours your soul
youll offer him a glass of wine

MORE CASH as it FLOATS from the hands of GAMBLERS before
being SUCKED down the green felt vacuums of blackjack tables
craps roulette baccarat Texas Holdem and so on
CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
The soul of a gambler does not wait
in limbo at the pearly gates Its
either blessed with wins and
granted heaven-- or plagued with
losses and burns in hell

The rising pulse of chance fills the room with the hopeful
heartbeats of SUCKERS as the SOUNDS OF DICE CARDS AND SLOTS
become a musical score orchestrated to lure the dreamers

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
The epitaph of suckers who attempt
to beat the odds are etched on
financial tombstones from Atlantic
City to Las Vegas

THE CAMERA FINDS-- TWENTY-FOUR-YEAR-OLD baby faced CHARLIE
IRISH LOGAN Slight build street cool with eyes that give
you nothing Hed be your hundredth guess if you were asked
to pick the card shark in a room amongst ninety-nine suckers

ECU ON CHARLIE

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
My name is Charlie Logan on the
streets Im known as Irish This
is my story

We follow as he enters the Las Vegas landmark A portrait of
the Rat Pack at the entrance brings a smile to his face
Breathing in the nostalgia he looks over the casino floor

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
A year after I graduated Columbia
my classmates were pushing pencils
at accounting firms me I was
standing in the church of Sinatra

He walks through the casino until his sensor draws him to a
blackjack table where THREE PLAYERS are already playing

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Knowing where to sit can be as
important as knowing how to play

THE CAMERA PANS the PLAYERS EYES

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Desperation is the Velcro of Vegas

CLOSE ON Charlies eyes devoid of emotion
CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Our eyes are the entry to the soul
The best gamblers allow no one in

The DEALER breaks FOUR DECKS Charlie takes a seat and runs
his hand across the green felt He grips a hundred dollar
chip like a closer would a rosin bag He STICKS the chip to
the green felt playing field-- a foundation for a skyscraper

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Casinos are built on the cash lost
by one week out of fifty-two-week-
players who believe they can turn
bonus checks into retirement funds

CLOSE ON The Three Players

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Theyre dreaming

The Dealer shuffles cuts then spreads BLUE BICYCLES across
the table like icing The cards lay there for a millisecond

before being sent back like dominos into the dealers shoe

then dealt like bullets to Charlie and The Three Players

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Vegas is a drug Street value--
priceless Casinos know theres no
generic for what they sell

SHOW GIRLS pass by stealing the other Players attention for
a second Charlie notes their lack of focus

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Once hooked-- the high is
incomparable but the low-- oceans
of morphine cant ease the pain of
detoxing an empty bank account

Silent prayers as The Three Players look at their cards The
Dealers rhythm strikes a tempo that bleeds cool confidence
as the cadence of the game moves at light speed

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
I like a dealer who moves the game
like a greyhound chasing a rabbit

Charlie looks at his cards like a diamond cutter working to
separate perfection from coal

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
For me the rabbit cant run fast
enough I want in and I want out
AS TIME PASSES chips start to pile up in front of Charlie

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Im not here to drink get a comp
for the buffet or see the show

A WAITRESS approaches to take drink orders Charlie places a
ten dollar chip on her tray then immediately waves her off

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Im here for a little taste skim
the cream and leave the coffee
Ill play six casinos a night to
avoid attention but attention is
hard to avoid when youre winning

HOUSEWIVES in sequin cocktail dresses FACTORY WORKERS in
silk shirts bit players in a world of fantasy CHEER as
Charlie makes a run The Three Players increase their bets in
a futile desperate attempt to recoup their losses

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
What most gamblers discover far too
late is once in the casinos cage
theyre fresh meat to a ravenous
lion They will be eaten and no
bones will be left on the plate

One by one the Players fold Their hands turning into frozen
tundra Stacks of chips now falling off the Casinos cliff
Meanwhile Charlie continues to mount an attack on the lion

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Blackjack offers a slight edge But
slight can make for a nice living
if you can count cards Now Im the
lion and the casino is fresh meat

An ocean of cards swim laps across the felt Charlies eyes
give no clue as they scan every card His mind an infinity of
megabytes stored and calculated as he card counts

A PIT BOSS watches the action A FLOOR BOSS looks up to a
security eye Charlie can feel the eyes watching

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Now I know better than to continue
I know its time to go to check my
ego at the door and leave this
casino a half a syringe of dignity
But Im a twenty-three-year-old
staring at a boxcar of chips

CHIPS continue to stack up as he eats their cash like candy
The Dealer chants TWENTY-ONE and BLACKJACK like a mantra as
Charlie continues to murder the already dead

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Its so fucking hard to walk when
you know their balls are in a vice

The Floor Boss face tightens as Charlie draws TWO EIGHTS

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
I could double down but Im not a
whore I want this to appear pure
Like virgin luck A first timer on
a boot camp weekend pass who wakes
up smiling in a Tijuana brothel

Charlie moves his whole stack of chips a fraction forward
The CROWD nearly faints at the size of the bet

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Every drop of my blood can feel
this move The identity of the next
card travels my veins like heroin
to the brain Too late to stop it
See the sweat on his brow

CLOSE ON The Floor Boss wiping beads of sweat--

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Im causing it and its about to
get worse and never better

The Dealer slowly begins to draw Charlies next card The
CROWDS anticipation as thick as six stacked New York steaks

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Its hard to match the rush of
heisting a casino when your only
weapon is your mind which is more
lethal than a machine gun if loaded
with the right information

FREEZE FRAME On the next CARD before it is revealed--
CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Im about to put an ice pick
through their temple Fuck-- how
did I get here
INT DELIVERY ROOM - DAY - (FLASHBACK)

Elvis Presley DEVIL IN DISGUISE
SUPER St Francis Hospital New York - April 26 1959

A DOCTOR spanks the butt of a BABY BOY with the perfect
Gerber face A SCREAM as he takes his first breath

CHARLIE (VO)
From the moment I was born people
said that I had something special

A NURSE wraps him tightly in a warm blanket His coo brings a
smile to her face She lays him down on the beautiful pure
white Irish skin of his mother NATALIE LOGAN 21

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)

Charlie gestures to the FAT MAN-- so close The Fat Man
flips him off Charlie laughs shaking the quarters in his
hand before running to sit at the bar next to his Father

CHARLIE (VO)
My mother passed when I was six
That left my father to raise me
and our environment to shape me

DANNY LOGAN now late 30s a Greyhound Bus Company shirt his
WESTIES TATTOO faded but not gone reminds us of his past

As the BARTENDER plops down two slices of pizza Charlie lays
down the stack of quarters to pay

DANNY LOGAN
Whered you get the loot

CHARLIE

couldnt pick up the spare

DANNY LOGAN

BALLPLAYER
The skins got no big man You wanna

Shirts have that wall with feet

A PLAYER on the shirt squad stands center court every bit of

can outrun daylight

BALLPLAYER
The skins wont get within five

CHARLIE
Five A buck says skins give them a
run Ill take skins plus two

Charlie pulls a dollar from his bookbag The Ballplayer pulls
a buck from inside his sock leg

BALLPLAYER
Okay skins plus two Youre about
to learn the evils of gambling

CHARLIE
You just bet that the Pope dont
pray on Sunday

As the game unfolds the smaller but quicker skins team hangs
tough The lead keeps changing hands The shirts final
basket beats the skins by only a point Charlie shoots a
smile as he takes the ballplayers dollar

BALLPLAYER

CHARLIE (VO)
If you were a gambler who breathed
New York air it was impossible not
to have heard of Jackie Gazzo

In the last booth JACKIE GAZZO 60s button down cashmere
sweater reads La Divina Commedia by Dante Alighieri A
BLACK BRIM HAT sits next to him on the table

A BODYGUARD motions Charlie to sit A WAITER places an
espresso cup in front of Jackie As he sips his double shot
he stares at Charlie with a lifetime of experience behind
dark and unforgiving eyes It feels like an eternity Then--

JACKIE
So youre the kid

CHARLIE
Im Charlie Logan

JACKIE
Do you know who I am

Charlie replies with just a slow nod

JACKIE (contd)
Do you know why youre here

Charlie shakes his head

JACKIE (contd)
I hear someone hit a twenty-to-one
at Aqueduct for ten large I dont
blink I hear someone hit for fifty
large laying nine on the Jets I
dont blink But when six books
tell me that for a year straight
some kid is beating them up with
lousy dime bets on basketball
baseball and football while
hitting three races a day five
days a week you know what I do

CHARLIE
Blink

JACKIE
No I wonder I wonder why this kid
aint betting ten dimes

CHARLIE
To avoid this very thing
JACKIE
Winning smaller amounts wont draw
less attention A few big wins just
makes a moment of fame But winning
day in and day out makes a legend

CHARLIE
Not looking to be a legend-- just
looking to keep making a living

JACKIE
Howd you like to bet with somebody
elses dime They win you win
They lose you get a free ride

CHARLIE
Sounds too good to be true

JACKIE
Its only too good to be true if
youre a fluke You a fluke Logan

Jackie throws the challenge like a hundred mile an
fastball aimed at a rookies heart

CHARLIE
I aint no fluke

JACKIE
This aint no nickel and dime play
My kind of action moves the line
Your luck gonna run out tomorrow

CHARLIE
My picks arent based on luck
Before I choose heads over tails I
flip that quarter a thousand times

JACKIE
So thats it you flip quarters

CHARLIE
The quarters are just a metaphor

JACKIE
I know what the fuck a metaphor is
Im an anomaly Whats your excuse

CHARLIE
I grind it out until I find that
one thing that no one else had the
patience to find Then I take that
missing piece and solve the puzzle

hour

JACKIE
And what puzzle is that kid

CHARLIE
Whos gonna win whos gonna
lose and by how much

JACKIE
You think its just that simple

CHARLIE
Not simple Fact I grind I win

JACKIE
Fifty-two and a quarter percent or
better kid Thats what you need
to stay ahead Not too many guys I
know can keep that going past two
Sunday sermons but if you can
Ill make you fatter than a million
Santas at an all-you-can-eat

CHARLIE
Im running about seventy percent

Jackie lets that percentage settle in A smile comes to his
face Its brief-- but its clearly satisfying

JACKIE
I knew your grandfather Billy

CHARLIE
I never had the pleasure

JACKIE
The way he went was a fucking
crime If you cant trust Irish
cops-- I mean who the fuck can you

CHARLIE
Word was they were Italian

JACKIE
That so Well I still prefer
Brooklyn That neighborhood you
come from-- too many funerals

The meaning behind that statement rests on Charlies
shoulders like a thousand pound weight of reality

JACKIE (contd)
So whadda you say you and me make a
little change together

CHARLIE
Im planning on going to Columbia

JACKIE
Im not a fucking guidance
counselor but if it dont
interfere with our thing then go

CHARLIE
I appreciate your offer--

JACKIE
This place look like JC fucking
Penny This aint a job offer Its
the gateway to your chosen way of
life-- and Im the gatekeeper

better life This is your one

GUY in a waiting TOWN CAR The car immediately speeds off

hands the NEWSPAPER to A GUY working behind the counter

CHARLIE (VO)
Now this whole procedure might
appear laced with paranoia but the
word paranoia means psychotic
disorder marked by delusions of
persecution or of grandeur

A BLACK CADILLAC stops at the corner A HOOD jumps out steps
to the newsstand The NEWS GUY gives the Hood the NEWSPAPER

all designed to get my picks safely
into the hands of these five guys

Charlies PICKS are passed around to each of the Five Men
They look more like bank board members than a betting crew

CHARLIE (VO) (contd)
Gambling is fly paper to
degenerates but winning cleanses
better than pure bleach It can
transform street whores into
thousand-dollar call girls and
wiseguys into world class bankers

Each of the Men gives a nod of approval then one dials on a
beat-up public phone on a wall next to a cigarette machine

fumes-—

WILLIAM
Good game Beginners luck

CHARLIE
Havent played in a while

WILLIAM

His smile fades as he draws a card off the top of the
furthest of four decks turning over a TWO OF SPADES A sigh
of relief as he turns over the EIGHT OF DIAMONDS to make TEN
The THIRD CARD still sits on top of the deck

CHARLIE (contd)
Im gonna give you an out Lets
forget this and split the pot

WILLIAM
Why Ive got ten Im not the
sucker who needs an out

Williams friends laugh He salivates over the pot until
Charlie reaches over and turns up the THIRD CARD An ACE OF
HEARTS stabs like a knife

CHARLIE
Next time a Sucker offers you an
out you ought to think a moment
Because the real sucker in the room
might just turn out to be you

could watch a movie once then
recite every line And by sixteen I
could remember every card dealt
from four decks in sequential
order I remember things even when

this part of me for years You just
chose to ignore it Cash in the
shoe boxes the diamond cross the
tuition for Columbia

AVERY
You finally threw that back in my
face I never asked for that money

CHARLIE
I know that I was just making a
point And for the record-- I paid
your tuition because I love you

AVERY

have to work with those people Do

AVERY

telling it straight I need to know
where my life is heading if I stay

CHARLIE

AVERY
You think its easy wondering
whether youre alive or dead until
I feel you crawl into bed at night

AVERY (contd)
You could be anything you want

my immunity from an ordinary life

AVERY
Is that how you see life with me

CHARLIE
Of course not Can we just forget
this night

AVERY
Its not just this night I cant
live everyday in the unknown

CHARLIE
Life is all unknown

AVERY
Not for you You never make a move
without knowing the odds You never
leave anything to chance I think
you knew that ace was there before
we ever arrived And you know at
this very moment if you can or
cant go on without me

CHARLIE
I never want to be without you

AVERY
Then you have to trust me enough to
tell me everything Even the things
I wont want to hear

CHARLIE
I do trust you And I dont trust
easy But the truth wont make life
perfect

MATTY
Two detectives followed him home
from the diner They said something
about wanting him to pay the pad

JACKIE
He runs because of scumbag cops

MATTY
I dont think these cops were ours
They didnt give a shit about who
Charlie knew-- and they made it
clear theyd be back

Uncle Jackie--

JACKIE
Its odd how you call me Uncle
Jackie whenever youre scared

MATTY
He just ran because--

Jackie puts his finger over his own lips-- gesturing Matty to
stop talking Matty stops-- frozen in Jackies icy stare

JACKIE
Running is futile Fear follows
wherever you go Looms patiently
until you think youre safe Then
like a snake it strikes to
paralyze-- so you never run again
Now go find him-- bring him to the
midnight ferry

MATTY
Uncle Jackie--

An awkward moment as Charlie hands him a reheated cup Matty
tries not to grab his ribs as he sits but the pain wins

CHARLIE
So-- whats todays word

MATTY
Dont have one yet

Out of character Mattys dictionary remains closed as he
bites his bagel without any cream cheese on it

CHARLIE
I got a word-- consuetude A mode
of behaving by fixed repetition
Like a ballplayer stepping to the
line repeating his ritual before
every foul shot If he changes his
ritual I know hes questioning
himself I know hes dealing with
something Like a guy who eats his
bagel without his usual glob of
cream cheese Or leaves his
dictionary unopened It makes me
wonder if I can I count on him Do
I bet with him or against him

Matty eyes his unopened dictionary-- the plain bagel in his
hands The tension between them is thick--

MATTY
History says you bet with him

CHARLIE
I hope history proves right

watches as Matty winces just to stand and pick up the phone
