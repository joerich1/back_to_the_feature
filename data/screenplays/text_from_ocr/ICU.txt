EXT CHICAGO-EVENING
Dusk falls on the jagged Chicago skyline

Gray sky Dirty snow Winter’s been here a while and isn’t
leaving any time soon

Christmas lights blink to life in storefronts and trees
doing little to lift the damp shroud smothering the city

The five o’clock traffic thickens on Lake Shore Drive
running parallel to--
LINCOLN PARK

--where even in the ugly cold a fair number of JOGGERS
CYCLISTS DOG WALKERS and STROLLER PUSHERS line the paths

Moving in closer we find and follow A MAN (60s)
Distinguished Bifocals tweed overcoat

He’s walking a GERMAN SHEPHERD A big strong dog Looks
more like it’s walking the man than the other way around

He leads the dog out of the park stopping at--

A CROSSWALK
--as traffic BLURS past
A few other waiting PEDESTRIANS eye the dog warily

The light changes and the crowd spills onto the street but
the dog hesitates distracted The man tugs on the leash

MAN
Bailiffcome on

The dog stays put Turns sniffs the air BARKS

The man shakes his head as he’s left behind He checks the
signal a flashing orange hand 121110

He hesitates thinks about ithell he can still make it
He steps into the street tugs again at the leash

The dog whips its head around Not budging BARKS again

MAN
I said c’mon let’s go--
--a black BMW careens around the corner and HITS THE MAN
tossing him through the air and into the intersection

A few ONLOOKERS scream and jump back then look at the man
crumpled in the road

He isn’t dead just had the living shit knocked out of him

He clutches his side GROANS as traffic SQUEALS to a stop
around him The dog spins in circles BARKING like mad

The BMW sits motionless twenty feet beyond the man Engine
HUMMING at a low menacing idle License plate smeared with
mud and snow illegible

No one gets out of the car

The man pushes himself up on his elbows as other DRIVERS
start getting out of their cars -- one of the ONLOOKERS
approaches to help--

--when suddenly the BMW lurches into REVERSE tires
SQUEALING forcing the Good Samaritan back onto the sidewalk
before running over the man’s leg--

CRACK

--his leg SNAPS and he collapses back onto the road

More GASPS and SCREAMS from the crowd as the BMW slaloms
through the stopped cars and accelerates from the scene

vanishing

EXT MT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER-EVENING

A teaching hospital in the heart of downtown Huge A
sprawling complex topped by dual towers scraping the sky

The whole place assaulted by wicked snow flurries

IN THE HOSPITALS HALLWAYS

Some half-hearted holiday decorations dot the walls but
there isn’t a whole lot of holiday cheer left here

Too many patients too few staff This place is a hair’s
breadth away from devolving into serious chaos
Walking through swinging double-doors labeled INTERNAL
MEDICINE is DR CLAIRE HASKINS Over-worked but
wearing it well There’s a brilliance and grace beneath the
fatigue and wrinkled scrubs

CLAIRE
--and the platelet and CBC counts
all check out

At her side is resident ELLIE FISHER narrating a chart
as Claire thumbs through it

ELLIE
(nodding)
That’s why I wondered if we’d be
safe waiting for a MAG-3

CLAIRE
Peritoneal hemorrhage is still a
concern a CT might not find it
(pause)
You said a car wreck

They’re separated as Claire dodges a RATTLING supply cart
without looking up from the chart She’s apparently
navigating by sonar

ELLIE
Yeah
(re-joining Claire)
-except he wasn’t the one driving
a car Just walking his dog

CLAIRE
Ouch He’s still in ortho

ELLIE
Just moved to ICU oh and he’s
on Coumadin Ten meegs a day

CLAIRE
Keep a close eye on his INR I
wouldn’t let it get over--

--they round a corner and Claire roughly BUMPS SHOULDERS
with a JANITOR pushing a cleaning cart the other way

JANITOR
Pardon me doctor My fault

He lowers his head keeps pushing his cart down the hall as
Ellie cuts him a fuck’s-your-problem look
CLAIRE
(walking again)
--wouldn’t let it get over about
seven
(on second thought)
--make it six-and-a-half Just to
be on the safe side

They reach the end of the hall time to part ways Claire
hands Ellie the chart

ELLIE
Well thanks for saving me a
fishing expedition
(Claire nods)
So what are you still doing here
anyway Shouldn’t you have checked
out like four hours ago

CLAIRE
(shrugging)
Thought we could use the extra
hands And still waiting to hear
back from radiology Problem
patient

Ellie nods Claire starts to pivot away--

ELLIE
Claire

Claire stops turns Ellie lowers her voice quick head
check of the hallway No easy way to say this

ELLIE
I just got an appearance request
from the Review Board About the
Hanson case

Claire flinches Knew this might be coming

ELLIE
(rapid-fire)
-don’t worry I totally have your
back All the way There was no way
you could have known--

CLAIRE
--listen I don’t expect you in any
way to distort or--
ELLIE
--no God no It’s not that It’s
justI know it’s been

Eating you alive She doesn’t need to say it out loud
Claire’s face remains a stoic mask

ELLIE
I just wanted to give you a heads
up is all

Claire nods a curt thanks anything else

ELLIE
(re chart)
Thanks again for helping me out
with this guy

Claire nods no problem as Ellie turns leaving her alone

She closes her eyes Takes a deep breath Quietly shaken by
the news needs a moment to herself When

Zzzrrr Zzzrrr That unmistakable sound of a vending machine
returning a wrinkled bill We follow Claire’s eyes--

BY VENDING MACHINES

--to a WOMAN forcing a crinkled bill into the machine It
spits it out She tries again It spits it out

This is DANIELLE PEARCE (30s) Prim and proper bookishly
attractiveand very pregnant Full term or close to it

Claire approaches digging through her pockets She pulls
out a relatively crisp dollar

CLAIRE
This machine is a little finicky I
usually just use the one on the
fourth floor

Danielle turns meets Claire’s eyesand promptly bursts
into tears Claire’s taken aback Whoa

WOMAN
I’m sorryit’s just(sniff) my
dad He’s inin so much (sniff)
painall he wants is some
(sniff)fucking apple juice

She takes Claire’s dollar slides it into the machine
WA-CHUNK as the drink falls She actually gasps with relief
DANIELLE
Oh thank God

She glances at Claire embarrassed Knows how this must
look She tries to get herself together

DANIELLE
I’m really not crazyit’s a
hormonal thing I’ve been trying so
hard to keep a brave frontfor
him you know I guess it’s all
just coming out

CLAIRE
I’m sure it means a lot to him that
youre here

DANIELLE

It’s justI’ve never seen him
like this So helpless And then on
top of everything

(hand on stomach)
this She’s due tomorrow

(pause)
At least were already at the
hospital right

Danielle shakes her head wipes her eyes Some fucking
Christmas

CLAIRE
You know we have a chaplain if
you want somebody to talk to--

DANIELLE
--no I’m fine Just want to get
dad something sweet to drink
(pause)
Thank you though

She means it Just needed someone to talk to She holds
the can in a toast before turning and leaving--

CRACK

as the can of juice is opened--

up
PATIENT ROOM-ICU

--and held to the lips of JACK PEARCE We recognize him as
the hit-and-run victim Looking a hell of a lot worse now
Bruised Frail In pain

His broken leg hangs over the bed shin full of so many rods
it may as well be a pin cushion

Danielle holds the can to her father’s lips as he takes a
long swallow

PEARCE
(raspy quiet)
Thank you sweetie

He collapses back onto his pillow Smacks his lips juice
dribbling down his chin Almost infant-like

DANIELLE
What else do you need right now

He just lays there Eyes closed She wants to cry but
can’t Has to maintain the brave face

GRUFF MALE VOICE (PRE-LAP)
More tests Christyou kidding
me

PATIENT ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Claire’s at the bedside of ALAN FOSTER (60s) Her problem
patient White stubble on a face creased with permanent
frown lines He’s a crusty old bastard

CLAIRE
I understand you’ve already had a
lot of tests we just can’t be too
careful when it comes to--

FOSTER
--hell yes I have I just go in to
see my family doc get a goddamned
finger up my ass next thing I’m
hearing is possible meningitis and
here I am and it’s test this test
that

CLAIRE
You’re still not feeling any
shoulder pain Headaches
FOSTER
How many times I gotta say it I
feel fine I just want to get home
spend Christmas with the grand kids
for crissake

CLAIRE
I’m sorry Mr Foster we can’t let
you do that until we got to the
bottom of this--

FOSTER
--you running a prison or a
hospital here Listen I was a cop
for thirty-seven years Charge ‘em
with a crime or turn ‘em loose was
how we did things

Claire rubs her temple has had about enough of him
BZZZ Saved by the bell She glances at her pager

CLAIRE
That’s radiology right now

HALLWAY-MOMENTS LATER

Claire rounds a corner offers a smile to WALTER (late 60s)
Security guard Friendly face slight hitch in his step
Probably should have retired a few years ago

WALTER
(slowing wants to talk)
Hey doc

Claire stops He glances around lowers his voice
WALTER
Was wondering if you’ve given any
more thought to what I asked you
about earlier

CLAIRE
What’s that

WALTER
Aboutyou know

She doesn’t His eyes dart down to his waist Embarrassed
CLAIRE
Ohoh Rightlisten you really
need to see a family doc about
that Walter I shouldn’t be going
around dishing those things out
like candy you know

WALTER
Well Mrs Walter would appreciate
it as well

He winks at Claire if you know what I mean She suppresses
a smile continues down the hallway

CLAIRE
I’1l1 think about it

WALTER
(calling after her)
Cmon docit’s Christmas

Claire holds up her hand in a wave continues down the hall
into--

RADIOLOGY

--where she turns another corner and sees a shaggy-haired
BOY (8 or 9) fingers tapping away on an ipod earbuds
crammed in his ears

Claire watches in alarm -- her eyes zeroed in on the ipod
cradled in his palm as he absently reaches for the handle

CLAIRE
Hey You can’t go in there

But he can’t hear her his head filled with ear-shredding
rock He looks up in surprise as Claire’s hand latches onto
his wrist

BOY’S POV as Claire’s lips move silently to the blaring
soundtrack

BOY
(pulling the earbuds out)
Huh

CLAIRE
I said you can’t go in there You
could get hurt OK

She points to illuminated red sign over the door No entry
allowed MRI in use

BOY
Just looking for the bathroom

CLAIRE
(pointing)
Down that hall

He turns putting his earbuds back in

WOMAN (0OS)
There you areHayden

Hayden snaps to his MOTHER’S voice She stomps the several
steps over to them grabs his hand and storms off without a
thanks or even a nod to Claire

Claire shakes her head and turns Some people

IMAGING ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Claire stands behind a bleary-eyed RADIOLOGIST squinting at
a series of images on the monitor in front of him

RADIOLOGIST
--yeah well not my job to make
sense of it that would be your
department

Through the observation window we see a PAIR OF BARE FEET
disappear into an MRI machine

RADIOLOGIST
I just give you the pictures

CLAIRE
And you’re sure about the margins

RADIOLOGIST
(nodding behind him)
See for yourself

Claire turns towards the lightboard switches on the
backlight finds the image labeled Foster

She squints making some sort of sense from the dark shapes
CLAIRE
(puzzled)
Huh

Her eyes narrow she’ll figure this out

MEDICAL RECORDS-LATER

Claire slumped in a cubicle in street clothes now Thumbing
through a thousand-page textbook other fat reference books
fanned around her

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
I was afraid I’d find you here

Claire looks up to see DR PATRICE WATKINS (50s) Sinai’s
Chief of Medicine Barbed wire exterior seen-it-all eyes
She’s been in this game a long time

Patrice approaches glances over Claire’s shoulder

PATRICE
So you’re still workin’ on our
grouchy friend

CLAIRE
MRI’s conclusive but the
ultrasound is cleanit just
doesn’t add up There’s got to be
something I’m missing

Patrice grabs a chair sits next to Claire

PATRICE
What’s your gut telling you

Claire meets Patrice’s eyesfinally shrugs not sure
Patrice sees something else in Claire’s eyes

PATRICE
So I suppose you’ve already heard
about the Review Board

CLAIRE
Word gets around

PATRICE
Hell of a way to start your
fellowship year

She pulls a chair over sits next to Claire

PATRICE
Listen woman’s family has money
connections They’re just angry
Throwing their weight around
(pause)
Youll be fine You did everything
by the booklike always

Claire offers a thin smile thanks Patrice shakes her head

PATRICE
That’s your problem By the book
will get you off with the Review
Board it won’t get you off with
me

Claire straightens in her chair hackles up

PATRICE

(re the text books)
All this stuffthe information
you’ve got down cold

(leaning forward )
What I want to see is you trusting
yourself That’s what makes you a
doctor Not the information You
hearing me

Claire just looks at her maybe

PATRICE
Because there will be times when
you’re gonna find yourself in the
wild blue yonderno textbook No
safety net What then

Claire flinches She’s used to harsh words from Patrice but
something about this time is different Hitting a nerve

Patrice eases up shakes her head

PATRICE
Look at youI might as well be
talking to a zombie You heading
home anytime soon

CLAIRE
(nodding)
Starting call for the MCC

PATRICE
Christmas with the Cons huh Don’t
let those striped-pajama-wearing
motherfuckers ruin your holiday
cheer

Patrice slaps Claire on the knee stands Done with the
heart-to-heart

PATRICE
Now would you get out of here and
at least try and get some rest You
look like shit

She turns and leaves
CLAIRE
(under her breath)

And Merry Christmas to you too

Claire pulls her cell from her handbag CLOSE ON the
display as she checks it three missed calls

She winces Shitshe totally forgot

TUCKERS DINER-NIGHT

Inside the fogged windows of Tucker’s a blink-and-miss-it
greasy spoon

Alone at a booth is ALDEN HASKINS (50s) Salt-and-pepper
hair a guy’s guy Leather jacket motorcycle helmet on the
bench next to him

Empty plate and wadded napkin on the table he’s holding up
an opened copy of The Trib

CLOSE ON a two-column headline on p 3 District judge
injured in hit and run A black-and-white photo of Pearce
runs with the article

Alden’s fixated on the article when--

CRACKLE

--a FINGER pulls the paper down He’s startled looks up to
see Claire smiling at him over the paper

His startled expression is wiped away by a spreading smile

ALDEN
Hey there

CLAIRE
So sorry I’m late

Claire leans over a kiss on the cheek She shakes off her
jacket and sits down

CLAIRE
--wild day Felt like we were the
only place in the entire city still
open Just couldn’t get away

ALDEN
Seems like that’s been happening a
lot lately

CLAIRE
Tell me about it
(nods towards newspaper)
-what’s so interesting

He folds the paper and slides it aside and before he can
answer--

CLARENCE (0S)
There’s the Good Doctor Usual for
you

She turns to CLARENCE (50s) the short-order cook sweating
over the grill calling to her over his shoulder

CLAIRE
Please

CLARENCE
Workin’ on it right now

SIZZLE as he drops a basket of fries

ALDEN
What do you say we hammer a couple
tall boys Looks like you could use
‘em

CLAIRE
Can’t Just started callfor the
correctional center

He frowns

CLAIRE
(not this again)
Part of the job Dad
(pause)
Besides I’d still rather treat
hardened criminals than you

knowlawyers

She shivers at the word a disgusting prospect

ALDEN
Hey now

He smiles mock offended A running joke

CLAIRE
You being the exception of course

ALDEN
We’re a team right I put ‘em
away and you treat ‘em

He looks down as his phone BUZZES He checks it reads a
text message

ALDEN
Ill be damned

He looks up already apologizing he’s about to bail

CLAIRE
Pokeron Christmas Eve That’s
kind of pathetic

ALDEN
No going out to Des Plaines to
check out an Ironhead I found on
Craigslist Supposedly mint this
guy’s selling it for a song I’m
trying to play it cool

He stands starts throwing his jacket on Grabs his helmet

ALDEN
-but hoping like hell he isn’t
showing it to anybody else
(hesitating)
I could see about pushing it
back

She smiles shakes her head She knows he wants that bike

CLAIRE
Go ahead I got dibs on the first
ride

ALDEN
Sure thing

They stand hug

MINUTES LATER
Claire scans The Trib while she waits

CLARENCE (0S)
Hey buddybuddy you alright

Claire looks up to see a minor commotion at the counter a
young MAN collapsed off his stool propping himself up on
the counter

The DINER to his right helps him back onto his stool

CLARENCE
Hey Doc

Claire’s already on her way to the counter

The man straightens nods a thanks his neighbor tries to
shrug it off Seems embarrassed

Claire sits next to him puts her hand on his shoulder

CLAIRE
Heyyou feeling OK
CLARENCE
(to man)

Listen to the Good Doctor now

The man takes a few deep breaths steadies himself before
meeting Claire’s eyes This is ERIK (late 20s) Athletic
build well-dressed He flashes a disarming smile

ERIK
I think I’m fine

CLAIRE
You sure

ERIK
Yeah concussion Two weeks ago I
still get some dizzy spells Doctor
said it’ll pass
Claire leans closer watches his pupils

CLAIRE
Follow please

She holds up two fingers moves them slowly side to side
CLAIRE
Any ringing in the ears

ERIK
No

CLAIRE
Seeing any white spots Tunnel
vision

ERIK

(shaking his head)
I’m fine really It just comes and
goes couple times a day

Claire holds his eyes you sure He nods but she’s not
quite convinced

CLARENCE (0S)
Order up doc

He slides a steaming plate in front of her

CLAIRE
Thanks Clarence

She turns back to Erik nods towards her booth

CLAIRE
Why don’t you join me Make sure
this thing passes

ERIK
(hesitant)
I don’t want to impose

CLAIRE
I insist

He considers for a moment finally nods

ERIK
(offering his hand)
I’m Erik by the way

CLAIRE
(taking it)
Claire

BOOTH-MOMENTS LATER

They’re well into their meals laughing An easy rapport
forming between them

ERIK
--I swear that tree actually jumped
in front of me

(smacking his hands together)
Wham Guess I’m getting too old for
the black diamonds Couldn’t ask
for a clearer sign right

CLAIRE
I love sn--

BZZ Erik reaches into his pocket pulls out a buzzing cell

ERIK
Sorry I don’t mean to be one of
those guys just gotta check
this

He flips it open glances at the screen Seems satisfied
with what he sees slaps it shut

ERIK
Sorry

CLAIRE
No I was just saying I love
snowboarding too

ERIK
Yeah

CLAIRE
Absolutely Been a while since I’ve
been able to get away though

ERIK
Job’s not really a nine-to-five is
it

CLAIRE
It’s not

BZZZ Her pager proving her point She checks it MCC

CLAIRE
Sorry

He nods as Claire pulls out her cell dials
CLAIRE
Hi Doris Claire Haskins (pause)
Yes Since when (pause) OK He’s
been in solitary how long (pause)
And you’ve got him on Depronol
(pause) OK

Erik stirs some sugar into his coffee watches her as he
brings the mug to his lips listening

She hangs

He shakes

CLAIRE
Bump it up to 20 milligrams
(pause) No you’re doing all the
right things (pause) OK just let
me know Bye

up

CLAIRE
Sorry
(nodding to the pager)
Pretty much a slave to that thing

ERIK
I didn’t mean to be eavesdropping
but did you say something about
‘solitary’ As in confinement
(she nods)
What kind of hospital do you work
at anyway

CLAIRE
That was the MCC actually
(off his blank look)
-the federal prison downtown I
take call for them every now and
then

ERIK
(interested)
Really
CLAIRE

It’s a federal program helps me
out with my student loans

his head seems truly amazed Too much so

CLAIRE
What

ERIK
Nothing Just seems like

He searches for the right words

ERIK
-ean intriguing juxtaposition is
all Lovely young woman like
yourself treating rapists
murderers the dregs of humanity
and all that

CLAIRE
It’s not really my place to worry
about what got them there

ERIK
It doesn’t bother you a little
bit Thinking about what they did
to end up there

CLAIRE
They’re still my patients And I
took an oath

ERIK
So you take the whole professional
code thing seriously huh

CLAIRE
I do

ERIK
So youd treat anybody No matter
what

He clearly doubts it Claire stands her ground

CLAIRE
To the best of my ability yes

He shakes his head raises his coffee mug in a mock toast

ERIK
Well I admire that I don’t think
I could do it
(pause)
You ever wonder what it’s like for
them

CLAIRE
What do you mean

ERIK
You know living in a cage like
that

Claire shifts in her seat Where’s he going with this

ERIK
I mean what would you do If it
was someone close to yousay
your dad

Claire hesitates not getting the question

CLAIRE
What would I do

He leans closer his eyes boring into hers

ERIK
Because I would do anything
Anything

Claire shifts his sudden intensity making her
uncomfortable The awkward silence stretches

CLAIRE
(checking her watch)
Jesus I should really get going

She reaches for her coat Ditching him cold not bothering
with much pretense about it

ERIK
Hey I’m sorry I didn’t mean to
weird you out with all that--

CLAIRE
--it’s fine I just need to get
home get some rest

She stands pulls some bills out of her pocket drops them
on the table This was a bad idea

CLAIRE
»as do you That’s the best thing
for those dizzy spells

She offers him a wan smile as she turns
CLAIRE

It was nice meeting you Erik Good
luckand Merry Christmas

ERIK
(ice-cold)
Sit down Claire

She turns startled at his tone

CLAIRE
Pardon me

ERIK
I said sit down

Drilling her with his eyes Before she has a chance to react
he continues in a hard and even tone like cold intimidation
is his native language

ERIK
You’re about to get another page
from Doris at the MCC Your
patient’s gotten worse You’re
going to get called in And there’s
something you’re going to do with
this patient

Claire just stands there holds his gaze is he for real
She looks around the diner is this some kind of joke No
one seems to be paying them any mind

CLAIRE
Good night Erik

She turns for the door when suddenly Erik’s hand LASHES OUT
around her wrist

ERIK
You should look at this first

CLAIRE
Get your hands off ofme

Her words dying as her eyes move to a cellphone cupped in
the palm of his other hand

She squints at the image flinching Is that
She reaches for it he pulls it back
ERIK
Sit downplease Like I asked the

first time

She hesitates looks around the diner still no one paying
them any mind

She slides back into the booth as Erik holds the phone
across the table for her to see She looks at the image her
eyes widening in a moment of horrible recognition

It’s her father

The image is grainy underexposed but unmistakeably him

He’s in some kind of warehouse Wearing the same shirt and
leather jacket we saw him wearing just minutes earlier

Shadows obscure his face an expression of stoic confusion

CLAIRE
What is this--

ERIK
--this is two minutes old I got it
right in front of you We have him

Claire

CLAIRE
Youhave him

ERIK
Yes

CLAIRE

WHO ARE YOU

CLANG Her fist bangs the table A few heads turn their way
Erik offers them a reassuring smile

ERIK
(quiet)
Inside voice please

Clarence looks over his shoulder from the grill

ERIK
(clenched smile)
Smile Claire

She tries Clarence turns back to his burger-flipping

ERIK
(fast and hard)
You scream or cause a scene and I
promise you it will not be a good
thing for Alden

Claire’s eyes are stuck on the image of her father What the
fuck is going on This isn’t real Can’t be real

CLAIRE
That’s impossible I just talked to
him He was right here He was--

ERIK
--on his way to check out an
Ironhead A deal too good to be
true Well it was
(shaking his head)
He loves his bikes doesn’t he It
was too easy really

These words a knife twisting in her gut

ERIK
We know you love him He’s done so
much for you taken such good care
of you
(nodding towards the phone)
-and now you have the chance to
take care of him

WHACK The phone shuts with the finality of a coffin lid
Claire is equal parts shock and quiet fury No-no-no

ERIK
Are you ready to listen

Claire finally nods numb Then -- BZZ2Z2ZZ
She jumps on edge Her pager again She checks it MCC
ERIK
That’s Doris Better call her back

Your patient’s getting worse

Claire pulls out her cell dials Takes a few deep breaths
Getting it together

CLAIRE
Hi Doris it’s Claire (pause) OK

Erik watching Claire as she listens knowing exactly how
this conversation is playing out

CLAIRE
(listening)
Yes

Claire blinks back tears as the realization sinks in This
is real

CLAIRE
»I’11l be right in

EXT LAKE SHORE DRIVE--MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON the front of a black BMW a barely-there dent on
the bumper hairline fracture on the headlight

We’ve seen this car before The license plate cleaned off
and lit now Street legal

IN THE BMW
Claire’s driving knuckles white on the wheel

Erik’s in the passenger seat humming along to one of Bach’s
French Suites playing through the premium sound system

He’s a completely transformed person The charming young man
recovering from a concussion has transformed into someone
calculating ruthless In control

CLAIRE
What are you doing to him

ERIK
We’re just hanging on to him while
you help us out

Claire is crumbling

CLAIRE
I can’tI can’t do this

ERIK
Sure you can You’re a fellow ina
level-one teaching hospital You
can handle a little pressure

CLAIRE
(pounding the wheel)
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT

ERIK
(unfazed)
You’re going to have a series of
jobs Easy jobs Things you do
every day Routine stuff that won’t
get anyone hurt

He pulls one of several briefcases from the backseat opens
it on his lap Hands working with something

ERIK
You do these jobs well and
you--and your father--will get
through tonight just fine
Understand

She glares silently through the windshield He nods good

ERIK
Your patient’s name is Claude
Barstow He’s exhibiting severe
lower-right quadrant pain nausea
low-grade fever All the textbook
signs of acute appendicitis Your
first job is to get him out of the
MCC and into Sinai for an emergency
appendectomy

A moment of realization as this hits Clairesome of the
pieces falling in place

CLAIRE
And then what

ERIK
One job at a time

She pulls into the parking structure as the METROPOLITAN
CORRECTIONAL CENTER looms over them an angular concrete and
reinforced-glass fortress in the heart of downtown

CLAIRE
They won’t let you inside

He shuts the briefcase revealing a miniature electronic
device assembled in his hand

ERIK
They won’t need to

He reaches over and quickly affixes a mini-lapel mic and
button camera to her collar Virtually invisible

ERIK
When you get inside you’ll see the
guns the badgesyour instinct

will be to scream for help Don’t

He opens the glove box to reveal a small monitor He turns
it on and an image flickers to life

ERIK
Because I’1ll be with you every step
of the way and you make one false
step breathe one false word

He shows her the cell phone image
ERIK
--and I’1l make that call No

games Claire Now go

With a final glance at the image of her father she gets out
of the car

INT METROPOLITAN CORRECTIONAL CENTER-MOMENTS LATER

Claire walks into the security screening area The prison
bleak shadow-filled

She shows her credentials to a GUARD they exchange some
words She signs in her eyes landing on his badge

-then the gun on his hip She tries to mute the screaming
inside of her

ON VIDEO MONITOR all of this playing out in small
black-and-white images--

IN THE BMW

--as Erik watches and listens from the car

MCC CLINIC-MOMENTS LATER

Claire enters the prison’s clinic Ill-equipped and
out-dated Waiting for her is DORIS (30s) the clinic nurse

DORIS
I’m so sorry to call you in Dr
Haskins it’s just that he kept
getting worse he says the pain is
real bad--

CLAIRE
--it’s fine Doris It’s my job

Claire offers a weak smile follows Doris’ eyes through a
pair of observation windows into the dark examination room

Seated shirtless on an examination table is the silhouette
of CLAUDE BARSTOW (50s) Flanked by two armed prison GUARDS

DORIS
Here’s his chart

EXAMINATION ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Claire reads Barstow’s chart as she enters the room
exchanges nods and Merry Christmas with the guards

She turns gets her first good look at Barstow

He’s not particularly imposing physically but there is
something about him his presence that chills Claire Her
spine stiffens as she meets his eyes

His frame is lean and muscled tracked with scars and faded
tattoos

CLAIRE
I’m Dr Haskins

BARSTOW
(nodding)
Dr Haskins I’m federal inmate
Seven Nine Four Six Two

He has a battle-scarred but dignified almost regal bearing
Like an old lion in a silk robe

CLAIRE
Mr Barstow

Offering him the dignity of a name as she approaches

She begins a cursory physical examination feels his lymph
nodes slides a stethoscope onto his chest

CLAIRE
One deep breath please

He complies his oil-slick eyes piercing Claire as we listen
with her through the stethoscope to the SUCK AND WHOOSH of
his breathing

Claire notices his eyes drifting to her collar It’s dark
but the pin-prick camera is just barely visible He sees it

BARSTOW
I’m so sorry to bring you in here
on the holidays doctor Holidays
are a time for family (pause)
Family’s the most important thing
don’t you agree

Taunting her with a tight smile

CLAIRE
Would you lie down please

He does grimacing along the way She begins gently
palpating his abdomen

CLAIRE
Any trouble eating Nausea

BARSTOW
(nodding)
Couple days now Just can’t keep
anything down

CLAIRE
(lightly pressing)
Does this hurt

BARSTOW
(through clenched teeth)
Christ

He coughs in pain She stops the palpations runs the back
of her hand over his abdomen pausing at different spots

CLAIRE
Is the pain getting worse

BARSTOW
Last few hours yes

He knows all the answers He holds her eyes Testing her
She places her fingers over his wrist checks her watch

BARSTOW
So what are you thinking doctor

CLINIC-MOMENTS LATER

MALE VOICE
I don’t like it

Claire scribbles in Barstow’s chart as JACK CALLOWAY (50s)
watches over her shoulder He’s the MCC’s warden years of
dealing with convicts has turned him into a real dick

WARDEN CALLOWAY
It’s Christmas Eve I’m already
short-staffed I don’t know if I
can put together a decent escort

(MORE )

WARDEN CALLOWAY (cont’d)
and security detail right now
and he is what we would calla
high-risk inmate

CLAIRE
(shutting the chart)
It’s a medical emergency

WARDEN CALLOWAY
Simple as that
(hardening testing her)
Just sounds like a stomach ache to
me

Claire swallows Hesitates She’s not a good liar

IN THE BMW

Erik listening and watching the scene plays out on the
monitor He notices Claire’s hesitation tenses

CLAIRE (FILTERED)
His appendix could rupture any
minute he’d be dead in a few
hours So yeah it’s as simple as
that

Her voice full of steel Calloway finally nods

ERIK
Good girl

IN THE CLINIC
Calloway turns looks at Barstow through the glass Sighs

WARDEN CALLOWAY

Jesus what a time for this He’s
getting transferred to North
Carolina in one week to finish out
his stretch

(almost to himself)
»one piece of shit I’ll be glad
to flush outta here

He shakes his head turns to Claire

WARDEN CALLOWAY
Just be careful with this one My
boys won’t be using kid gloves with
him neither should you

CLAIRE
I’ve done this before

WARDEN CALLOWAY
I know But he’s different

Claire follows his eyes through the observation windows as
Barstow puts on his pinstripes

WARDEN CALLOWAY

Escaped from prison twice before
one a supermax joint in Louisiana
Killed another inmate with his bare
hands over some bullshit beef in
the exercise yard

(turning to Claire)
-that happened two years earlier
Did his time in solitary with a
smile on his face Just watch
yourself is all I’m saying

Barstow stops and turns looks directly through the glass at
Claire can he see her She suppresses a shudder

INTEXT BMW-MOMENT LATER

ERIK
You did good

He packs the mic and camera back in the briefcase as Claire
drives Her voice a little firmer hands a little steadier

CLAIRE
I can tell you right now whatever
you have planned is never going to
work There are cameras all over
the hospital they have an armed
escort at all times--they’re
handcuffed to the beds for God’s
sake He’s not getting out

She steals a look at him is any of this getting through
Erik just watches the road

CLAIRE
Well what next You want me to
operate on him I won’t

ERIK
One job at a time
(pointing)
(MORE )

ERIK (cont’d)
--about to miss your turn

Her eyes jerk back to the road she brakes and pulls into
Sinai’s parking structure

Erik pulls a duffel bag from the back seat Claire notices
hospital scrubs bulging out

She looks back at Erik closer this time Realizing

She flips the visor down revealing a plastic ID badge
clipped to it Mt Sinai Medical Center

CLAIRE
You’re the janitor

FLASH FRAME (FLASHBACK)
As Claire BUMPS SHOULDERS with the janitor

Moving closer we catch a partial glimpse of his facejust
enough to recognize Erik

IN THE BMW (PRESENT)
He smacks the visor back up

ERIK

Was a janitor I quit that gig not
enough opportunities for upward
mobility

(clipping a new badge onto his

shirt)
Tonight I’m Anthony Nakos a
third-year med student from U of C
making up an internal medicine
rotation I missed when I had mono

Claire shakes her head Can’t believe this

ERIK
You’re my supervising doc and I’m
your shadow
(reaching for the handle)
Let’s go

They get out of the car

EXT PARKING GARAGE-CONT
Erik extends a flattened palm across the roof

ERIK
Before we go inside I want you to
--(unintelligible)

His words are DROWNED OUT by a Pegasus Life Flight
helicopter SWOOPING LOW overhead towards the helipad on top
one of the hospital towers

Erik glances up watches the passing chopper waits for the
NOISE to die down He looks back to Claire waiting

CLAIRE
I couldn’t hear you

ERIK
(hand still extended)
I said your cell Please

She hesitatesbut doesn’t have a choice tosses it to him

They begin crossing the parking deck Claire’s cell
SHATTERING as Erik flings it to the pavement

-grinding it with his heel as they walk

AT A SIDE ENTRANCE-MINUTES LATER

As BARSTOW’S ESCORT arrives an ambulance flanked by two
motorcycles and three black-and-white patrol cars lights
whirling

-HOSPITAL SECURITY walk out to meet the escort opening
the doors in the back of the ambulance

INT INTERNAL MEDICINE UNIT-MOMENTS LATER

Claire and Erik stride down the hallways both in scrubs
Their voices tight lowered

CLAIRE
I want to talk to him

ERIK
That’s not how this works I check
in and let them know everything’s
good That and only that is
what’s keeping him alive They call
(MORE )

ERIK (cont’d)
or text me and I don’t respond in
time your dad swallows three
bullets

Simple as that Claire closes her eyes--the words like a
punch in the stomach

ERIK
That’s how this works Right now
you need to focus on your next
job--

They round a corner almost bumping into Patrice heading the
opposite direction

PATRICE
Sorry to see you back Claire

Claire shrugs what are you gonna do Patrice looks at Erik

PATRICE
Who are you

ERIK
Oh I’m Anthony Nakos Third year
from U of C Didn’t Debra tell you
about me

PATRICE
No

ERIK
Missed my internal med rotation
last monthmono They’re letting
me make it up over break

PATRICE
I don’t know anything about it

Erik shakes his head figures

ERIK
That sounds like Debra She said
she’d fax over the form before she
left for breakyou didn’t get it

BZZZ Patrice looks down at her pager frowns
PATRICE

(to Claire)
You know a family doc named Case

CLAIRE

PATRICE
So you probably don’t know why he’s
been harassing my ass all night
then either

Patrice pockets the pager looks back to Erik She hasn’t
forgotten about him

ERIK
I’m really sorry about the mix-up
I guess I should have followed up
myself before they closed the
office for the holidays

He offers a smile A real eager beaver Patrice frowns Just
one more thing to worry about

PATRICE
I’11l look through my paperwork when
I get to my office

Erik nods a thanks Patrice continues on her way Erik turns
to Claire picking up where they left off

CLAIRE
If she doesn’t find your paperwork
she’11--

ERIK

--fuck her Right now you need to
focus on your next job I want you
to--
BZZZ Another page Claire checks it looks at Erik

CLAIRE
I have to take this

Erik doesn’t like it not part of the plan
CLAIRE
I don’t show up within about five
minutes people will notice

Erik’s torn Smoldering impatientbut she’s right

ERIK
Let’s make it quick

PATIENT ROOM-MOMENTS LATER

Claire stands next to Foster’s bed looking through his
chart Erik stands behind her can’t seem to help staring at
Foster

FOSTER
I don’t understand if the tests
are clean why am I still here

CLAIRE
The ultrasound and blood work are
clean but we still have to
reconcile those with the tests from
yesterday and the MRI There are
still plenty of things we need to
rule out

Foster’s not buying it

FOSTER
What do you say you

He hesitates as he glances at Erik Foster’s noticing Erik
staring and not caring for it

FOSTER
-you let me leave and spend
Christmas with my family and you
keep playing Doctor Detective and
call me when you actually know
something

CLAIRE
You know I can’t do that--

FOSTER
--just look at all this shit

He holds up his wrist plugged with an IV ECG electrodes
stuck to his chest

FOSTER
--looks like I’m on life support
for God’s sake--

His eyes whip to Erik still staring at him
FOSTER
--is there something I can help you

with

Erik averts his gaze mumbles a half-apology Claire turns
to Erik what are you doing
FOSTER
(to Claire)
Is it possible the tests are wrong

CLAIRE
Not likely Sometimes we just have
to look closer double-check
everything

BZZZZ Claire’s looks at her pager then Erik that’s us

Foster waves her off

CLAIRE
-in the meantime please just be
patient and let us do our jobs
We’ll figure this thing out

HALLWAY-MOMENTS LATER

looks back to the TV grumbling

As Claire and Erik turn the corner out of Foster’s room

ERIK
What an asshole

CLAIRE
What were you doing in there

He nods towards her pager Lowers his voice

He shakes

ERIK
So he’s in prep
(she nods)
OK job number two--

CLAIRE
--I will not operate on him Do you
understand

his head she’s not getting it

ERIK
I know you won’t What you will do
is get him out of prep right now
Out of prep and into a private
room

CLAIRE
Just call off the surgery

ERIK
Stall order a CT scan a surgical
consult whatever--

CLAIRE
--I can’t just move patients around
like that There are protocols and
procedures and--

ERIK
--fuck the protocols Use your
white coat make it happen Just
keep him out of the OR

CLAIRE
Just because I wear a white coat
doesn’t mean I

Her voice trails off Both of them on high alert as Walter
(security guard) walks towards them His eyes on Claire

Claire stops breathing as Walter looks right at her Erik
clocking them both reading the situation

WALTER
(slowing)
Say doc

Claire slows to meet him Erik glowers keep it moving
CLAIRE
I’m -- I’m sorry Walter I’m kind

of in a hurry--

WALTER
--I was just wondering about that
prescription we talked about

CLAIRE
I’m sorry I just can’t right
now

He nods butsomething seems off He looks a little
closer everything alright

Claire forces a smile She’s still not breathing

CLAIRE
I really need to

She points get going Walter looks at her then Erik

WALTER
(finally)
Maybe later then When you’re
overtaken with the Christmas
spirit

Walter tips his hat shuffles off Claire finally exhales
Erik turns to her

ERIK
Private room Claire Can you do
that
She finally nods
ERIK

Then let’s move

SURGICAL PREP--MOMENTS LATER

Claire and Erik walk past the nurses’s desk and empty beds
to a curtained partition

Claire opens it to reveal Barstow’s bed

Empty

Claire spins frantic Her eyes scan the area and then look
to Erik he’s as confused as she is What the hell

NURSE (0S)
Dr Haskins

Claire turns to a DESK NURSE approaching from behind

NURSE
Mr Barstow was just prepped and
moved Dr Fisher came bywe
paged you
(pause)
He was--

CLAIRE
--which room

NURSE
--noncompliant With the
anesthesia They had to hold him
down to get him to--

CLAIRE
Which room

NURSE
(chastened)
Uhfourteen

CLAIRE
(calmer )
Thank you

OR HALLWAYS-MOMENTS LATER

Claire and Erik walk briskly past the mostly empty and dark
operating rooms

OR 14 is obvious it’s the one with two ARMED GUARDS -- real
meatcubes -- standing on either side of the door

Erik and Claire glance past the guards into the OR see the
SURGICAL TEAM around the table getting prepped Barstow’s
handcuffed to the bed and fully sedated

ERIK
(under his breath)
Stop this
Erik reaches for the door -- Claire grabs him by the wrist
CLAIRE

We scrub in first

Right rookie mistake The guards exchange a smirk dumbass

SCRUB SINKS-MOMENTS LATER
As they scrub in

ERIK
(under his breath)
How the fuck did he end up in the
OR so soon

CLAIRE
I order an emergency appendectomy
that’s what’s going to happen
Doesn’t mean I say when and how

ERIK
Just shut it down Now

She turns off the water backs towards the door holding her
hands high and away Erik follows her into--

OR 14

-- as the surgical team (ANESTHESIA TECH A SURGICAL TECH
SCRUB NURSE and Ellie) glance up at the new arrivals

CLAIRE
(sharp)
What’s going on

Ellie surprised at Claire’s tone This is routine stuff

ELLIE
Just taking out an appendix what’s
going on with you

CLAIRE
It was my order

ELLIE
Yes they paged from prep and you
didn’t show Patrice says get on
it and I was right there

Ellie shrugs Not a big deal

ELLIE
(very delicately)
AndI just thought you might feel
like sitting this one out

CLAIRE
Well I don’t And I wanted to see
him in prep first
(reaching for a reason)
I was thinking about a CT

ELLIE
To double-check You’re never wrong
on these

The rest of the team watches confused Erik and Claire’s
eyes meet -- her behavior is drawing attention He warns her
with his eyes cool it

ELLIE
It’s just an appendix Claire You
want it go ahead

Ellie steps away from Barstow revealing his lower abdomen
through a patchwork of surgical cloths ready to go

The tray of surgical tools stands by the tablewaiting to
be used

The team waits All eyes on Claire

Erik’s eyes meet hers an almost-invisible shake of his head
conveys all the meaning it needs to no

CLAIRE
I justI want to be sure
Her eyes move to the surgical toolsthe stainless steel

blades GLEAMINGthe Tech notices her rapid breathing the
SWEAT beading on her forehead

TECH
Dr Haskinsare you feeling
alright

CLAIRE
I’m fine

A wall of silencethe eyes in the room burning holes
through hershe gulps for breathher world closing in

ELLIE
Well let’s cut him

But Claire’s frozenthe SILENCE roaring in her
earswhen

BEEEEEEEEEEEP

An alarm from one the monitors Everyone snaps towards it
The alarm quickens Then a second then third alarm sound

Barstow is coding

The surgical team immediately transforms on the clock now

NURSE
BP 160 over 110 going up

Barstow’s face reddens and swells he starts convulsing--
CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK

--his handcuffs RATTLE against the bed rail

The nurse and tech struggle to hold him still

Erik’s eyes widen -- what the fuck is going on

The OR is a contained madhouse everyone focused on one
thing saving Barstow

ANESTHESIA TECH
BPM 130135

CLAIRE
Cut the drip -- cut everything

ANESTHESIA TECH
(pulling tubes flipping
switches)
On it

The GUARDS watch through the windows in alarm
ELLIE
(to Claire)
What the fuck is this

Their eyes meet over their masks Claire’s eyes flicker with

uncertainty -- Ellie waiting -- Claire snaps back to it
CLAIRE
I’m thinking MH
(to nurse)

Get the MH cart And we need Dr
Gardner in here

The nurse moves for the cart as one of the guards ventures
his head through the door

GUARD
So what’s going on in here--

ELLIE
OUT

The guard retreats back into the hallway

CLAIRE
I want five--make that six--hundred
milligrams of Dantrolene large
bore IV And let’s start the
hyperventilation

The tech slips an oxygen mask over Barstow’s face

CLAIRE
Ten liters a minute
44

TECH
Change the C02

CLAIRE
(shaking her head)
I’m more worried about that heart
rate

The nurse is back with the cart

TECH
Six hundred cc’s ready

The BEEPS from the heart-rate monitor still increasing

CLAIRE
Do it

The nurse plunges the syringe into Barstow’s arm

ERIK
Whatwhat’s happening to him

ELLIE
(to no one in particular)
Where the fuck is anesthesia
(to Erik)
You

Erik is standing helplessly to the side doesn’t respond

ELLIE
Hey Talking to you College Boy

His head whips to her me

ELLIE
Find out where anesthesia isit’s
Gardner Dr Gardner
(off his hesitation)
Now

Erik tries to stammer a response his eyes catching Claire’s
over their masks She freezes seeing something in his
eyessomething’s different

---Sshe looks away Back to work

Erik turns towards the door bumps chests with DR GARDNER
on his way in

DR GARDNER
(tying his mask)
Where are we

CLAIRE
Looks like MH

DR GARDNER
Dantrolene

CLAIRE
Six hundred cc’s

DR GARDNER
(eying the monitors)
Let’s up the 02 a little Good

CLOSE-ON Erik as he watches the scene play outhis eyes
burning hot with confusion worry anger

MINUTES LATER

The surgical team relaxed now Barstow’s stabilized his
eyelids fluttering open as he’s wheeled out of the OR

DR GARDNER
(to Claire)
I would do an hour monitoring
vitals in PAC-U then at least a
few hours in a Phase 2 step-down

CLAIRE
(nodding)
Came on fast and hard Never seen
anything like it

DR GARDNER
MH is a real bitch Tough to catch
in timebut looks like you did
He’s out of the woods for now
(to Claire)
You did good

He turns and leaves
ELLIE
I‘1l head with him to recovery get

started with a cold saline drip

CLAIRE
Thanks--

CRASH

They turn as Erik walks into the tray of surgical tools
knocking them onto the floor

ERIK
Sorrysorry

Ellie rolls her eyes amateur hour She leaves the room with
a wave to Claire

Erik bends down and starts picking up the tools dropping
them on the tray The surgical tech kneels next to him

TECH
I’ve got itI handle the tools

ERIK
Right

The tech nods towards Erik’s thin stainless-steel necklace

TECH
And no jewelry in the OR

ERIK
Yeah Thanks

He looks up sees Claire pulling off her mask and leaving
the OR He scrambles to his feet and follows her--
INTO THE HALLWAY
--Claire taking desperately-needed breaths as she walks
ERIK
What just happened in there Where
are they taking him

Claire doesn’t answer Just trying to keep herself sane for
the moment

Erik does a quick head check of the hallway grabs her arm
and rips her into a--
JANITOR’S CLOSET

--and shuts the door behind them Dark and dank His face
inches from her Faint light bleeding in around the door

ERIK
I said what the fuck just happened
in there

Hissing Furious

CLAIRE
He went into malignant
hyperthermia from the anesthesia

ERIK
What does that mean

CLAIRE
(calm collected)
It’s an allergic reaction It’s
rare but it happens We caught it
in time he’ll stabilize quickly

ERIK
How quickly

CLAIRE
Ten fifteen minutes Hopefully

ERIK
Good that’s good

His mind racing thinking ahead

CLAIRE
But he’s going to need monitoring--

ERIK
--where are they taking him

CLAIRE
Probably third floor ICU

Erik nods The cool and control returning Back to the plan
He’s cooling downbut Claire’s seen something

CLAIRE
This isn’t just some job is it

Erik thinks about answeringbut doesn’t He reaches for
the door handle Claire shifts to block him--

CLAIRE
Who is he

She narrows her eyes looking closely at him now Almost
through him Something catching the corner of her eye--

--in a quick movement she pulls down the neck of his scrub
shirt revealing the initials EB hanging from his necklace

CLAIRE
(realizing)
Erik

ERIK
Barstow
(slapping her hand away)
Smart girl

Beat as Claire absorbs this Jesus Christ

ERIK

So if you know

(a half-shrug)
-then you know I don’t give a
shit either way But just think
about how far youd go for your old
man
(grabbing the handle)
-eand know I’1ll go twice as far
for mine

He opens the door Claire wincing as the harsh green light
from the hallway hits her eyes

ERIK
Let’s pay him a visit

HALLWAY-MOMENTS LATER

Erik and Claire walk towards the ICU find Patrice waiting
for them at the entrance to the unit

PATRICE
So what the hell happened in there

CLAIRE
MH Out of nowhere

A NURSE timidly approaches Patrice from behind Looks like
she wants to be anywhere but here

NURSE
Excuse me Dr Wat--

PATRICE
(to Claire)
--you gonna change the juice and
try again

CLAIRE
Well I was thinking at least a few
hours of stepdown and monitoring--

PATRICE
--I know what the textbooks say He
ain’t a textbook case How soon

Claire caught in the headlights for a moment her eyes
moving between Erik and Patrice

NURSE
(trying again)
Dr Watkins A Dr Case is on the
phone He said--

PATRICE
--I’11 call him back

NURSE
He says it’s urgent He asked me
to--

PATRICE
(to nurse)
Did I stutter

The nurse winces this is exactly what she was afraid of
She slinks away Patrice turns back to Claire

PATRICE
Calloway wasn’t happy to hear about
it wants him out of here and back
in the Big House soon as possible
What should I tell him

CLAIRE
Tell him to get out of our asses
and let us do our job

PATRICE
(smiling)
I like that Claire
(serious )
--but that’s not what I’m telling
him And I want him out of here
too

CLAIRE
Couple hours maybe I’m going to
check on him right now

Patrice nods good

PATRICE
He’s in 314

ICU HALLWAY-MOMENTS LATER

Erik and Claire walk through doors marked Intensive Care
Unit approach the two guards flanking the door to Room 314

They’re both easily six feet tree-trunk necks the first
one sports a highly unfashionable flat top the other a set
of braces rubber bands and all

Flat Top takes a sip of coffee nods to Claire then blocks
Eric with a forearm

FLAT TOP
Doctors only

Erik looks to Claire take care of this

CLAIRE
It’s OK he’s a med student Have
to keep him on a short leash I’m
afraid

The guards exchange a look shrug whatever

BRACES
(raising his arms)
Please

Erik and Claire pausewhat The guard pats himself in his
underarm Erik and Claire look at each other oh They raise
their arms

BRACES
(patting her down)
Sorry about this doc Rules is
rules

CLAIRE
I understand

Flat Top frisks Erik hands sliding along his outstretched
arms then around his waist

His hands stop at the back pocket of Erik’s pants he found
something Claire tenses

Flat Top pulls out the cell

FLAT TOP
No phones

ERIK
Damnforgot I was carrying that
thing I’11l turn it off

Erik holds out his hand wants the phone back Flat Top
shakes his head drops it in his own breast pocket

FLAT TOP
I’1ll hang on to it ‘til you’re
done
(opening the door)
OK

The guards follow Erik and Claire into--

ROOM 314

--Claire walks over to the bed Barstow looks up at the
approaching footsteps His right hand cuffed to the rail

His face still swollen skin rashed He looks like hell

CLAIRE
How you feeling

BARSTOW
Been worse Believe it or not

Barstow looks and sounds lethargic but his eyes are clear
and alertsearching out Erik

Flat Top nudges Erik as Claire examines Barstow

FLAT TOP
(sipping coffee)
Got a question for you

Erik’s distracted his eyes on Claire and Barstow

FLAT TOP
-SO I been getting these stomach
aches lately They get real bad at
night but they go away when I eat
And just when I think I’m
fineBOOM They’re back again at
night

Beat as he waits Erik realizes he’s supposed to be
providing a diagnosis of some kind
ERIK
Eat more at night then

Flat Top looks at Braces you believe this guy
FLAT TOP
You got no ideas
(Erik shakes his head)
What you been sleeping in class

Erik still watching Claire check over Barstow

ERIK
You should ask a doctor

FLAT TOP
I just did

His tone sharpening Claire turns from the bed
defuse this She walks towards the guard

CLAIRE

You working a lot lately
FLAT TOP

Yeah
CLAIRE

Under a lot of stress
FLAT TOP

Hell yes
CLAIRE

Could be a peptic ulcer You should
think about getting an endoscopy

(nodding to his coffee)
Drinking too much of that won’t
help by the way

FLAT TOP
A what-o-scopy

CLAIRE
They’re simple painless Come by
after Christmas and I can set it up
for you If that’s what it is it’s
easy to treat

FLAT TOP
Thanks doc Hey one more thing

better

CLOSE ON Erik He’s tuned them out their voices turning to
mushhe walks slowly to the edge of Barstow’s bedtheir
eyes meetthere’s an understanding there

-ERIC’S HAND moves to Barstow’s
ERIK
How you feeling chief Gave us

quite a scare in there

Suddenly a seasoned doctor with a soothing bedside manner
Braces notices Erik standing over the bed

BRACES
Hey
Erik ignores him
BRACES
Hey Step away from the patient

please
Erik continues ignoring him patting Barstow’s hand

Braces stalks to the side of the bed grabs Erik’s shoulder
Erik steps away raises his hands

ERIK
Hey be cool man

BRACES
I said to st--

--when Barstow LUNGES UP IN BED AND PLUNGES A SCALPEL INTO
HIS NECK

Erik pivots holds Braces as Barstow draws the blade across
his neck opening a crescent-shaped wound that starts
spilling crimson as he collapses on top of Barstow--

FLAT TOP
Holy Christ--
SPLASH
--dropping his coffee as he reaches for his piece -- but
he’s too late fumbling -- Erik spins and clubs the guard’s

hands away and SLAMS his head into the wall--
--knocking Claire to the ground in the same motion--

--Erik rips a thin wire hidden in his waistband wraps it
around Flat Top’s neck and cinches it tight--

--as Flat Top SLIPS in the puddle of spilled coffee--
--Erik CINCHES the garrote even tighter--
--Claire scrambles to her feet and lunges for the door--

--but Erik drags the guard sideways blocking the narrow
path to the door--

--and Claire stands face-to-face with the guard now --
watching his bulging eyes his purpling skin--

FLAT TOP
(garbled)
Helpmeplplease

--Claire reaches for the guard’s holstered sidearm -- but
Erik beats her to it -- holding the garrote with one hand
and snatching the weapon with the other--

--leveling the gun inches from her forehead -- Erik’s face
part brutal focus and part exhilaration -- he actually seems

to be enjoying this--

--as Flat Top kicks weakly hands dropping to his side the
fight leaving him--

--while GURGLING sounds come from the bed as Barstow holds
Braces as he bleeds dry--

And after a few horror-filled moments it’s overRAGGED
BREATHING the only sound left in the room

Erik finally releases Flat Top he hits the floor like a
sack of flour

ERIK
(turning to Barstow)
You good
BARSTOW
(strained)
Helpget thissack of shit
off me
His voice squeezed by the weight of the guard on top of him

Erik turns to Claire waves the gun at her

ERIK
On the ground

She lowers herself to her knees Trembling Sick

ERIK
(walking past her)
On your stomach
She lies down her face landing inches from Flat Top’s

She shudders looks down and away her eyes landing on
Erik’s CELL PHONE peeking out of the guard’s breast pocket

Her eyes fly up to the two men Erik grunting from the
effort as he pulls Braces off of Barstow She sees her
chance

She pulls out the cell noiselessly opens it scrolling

Claire reads the number briefly closes her eyes got it

She slips the phone back into Flat Top’s pocket as across
the room Braces hits the floor with a THUD

ERIK
(turning)
I’1l get the keys

Erik strides back over to Flat Top and fishes the keys off
his belt pulls his cell out of the guard’s pocket Dials

ERIK
(into phone)
Yeah we’re ready Third floor
ICU Room 314
He hangs up crosses to Barstow’s bed and unlocks the cuffs

Barstow gets out of bed stands in front of Erik

A long moment between them The men not touching or
speaking but clearly overwhelmed by the moment

-it’s here The Day is finally here

ICU ELEVATOR LANDING-MOMENTS LATER
The elevator lights track downfivefourDING
The doors open and reveal TWO UNIFORMED GUARDS (call them

ZEKE and SCULLY) They’re dressed identically to the two
dead guards

They exit the elevator stroll casually into the ICU nod to
the DESK NURSES who don’t give them a second glance

They stop outside Room 314 Zeke cracks the door and slides
in a duffel bag shuts the door

He turns hands folded Standing guard

ROOM 314-BATHROOM
WHUMP

Erik dumps Braces into the bathtub wrapped in a
blood-soaked sheet and landing on top of Flat Top

He draws the curtain shut closes the bathroom door

In the main part of the room Barstow is cleaning up the
blood around the bed Claire still face-down on the floor

Erik drops some bath towels next to Claire

ERIK
Give him a handand don’t get it
on your scrubs

She gets to her feet takes the towels in her hand numbly
mops up the blood around the bed

Erik grabs the duffel bag and tosses it to Barstow

He opens it inside is a Sig a set of scrubs a cell phone
a white coat an ID badge

Erik walks past Claire WHISPERS something to Barstow
Claire can’t quite make it outmaybe a number

Barstow nods Erik turns to Claire

ERIK
Alright Claire Next job

Claire shakes her head Sick and dazed

CLAIRE
I can’tI can’t do this anymore
I’ll sign his discharge papers
I’1l1 walk you out the front door
myselfyou can escape right now
Just gojust go Please

Erik and Barstow exchange a look as Barstow peels off his
prison garb and changes into the scrubs from the bag

ERIK
Escape
(shaking his head)
He doesn’t want to escape Claire

Claire just stands pressed against the wall what the hell
does that mean

ERIK
(checking his watch)
Sowe’ve got a few minutes to
kill You feel like some shitty
food

HALLWAY-MOMENTS LATER

Claire grabs Barstow’s chart from the wall as they leave the
room her eyes stuttering when she sees the guards who
are these guys

Erik guides Claire by the elbow down the hall towards the
elevators

--and we stay for a moment with the guards as PATIENTS
and HOSPITAL STAFF walk by the room not giving it a second
glance Nothing out of the ordinary here

Then shuffling towards them and pushing his IV pole is
Foster He stops when he reaches the guards

FOSTER
You boys from the MCC
(they nod)
Who you got in there

ZEKE
Not allowed to say

FOSTER
Course not How’s that sonofabitch
Calloway He still top dog over
there

Zeke and Scully exchange a quick look they don’t know

ZEKE
Yes sir

FOSTER
He got you pulling holiday duty
huh Fuck him

The guards nod impassively Not interested But Foster’s
happy to have a kindred spirit to talk to

FOSTER
Name’s Foster I was precinct
captain over at the one-four-seven
Started out as a screw at the MCC
though Three year stint

Their faces blank They don’t give a shit

Foster’s eyes narrow something about them off Not gelling
with him the way they should lawman-to-lawman

Whatever Foster mumbles a Merry Christmas and shuffles down
the hallway towards his room

PATRICE’S OFFICE
Patrice at a cluttered desk barking into the phone

PATRICE

(into phone)
Because this kind of thing happens
that’s why

(listening)
I don’t like it either Warden I
wanted him out of here two hours
ago

She looks up at a KNOCK on the door sees a mousy MAN (DR
MARK CASE 40s) in street clothes She waves him in

PATRICE
(into phone)
-as fast as medically
responsible is when

She rolls her eyes exasperated as Calloway continues his
muddled voice reflecting a serious lack of patience

PATRICE
(into phone)
--then just get out of our asses
and let us do our job

She slams the phone down A sigh She looks at Case yes
DR CASE
Dr Watkins I’m Dr Mark Case

from Lincoln Park Family Practice

He rubs his hands on his pants All nervous energy

DR CASE
I called earlier Several times
actually

PATRICE

RightDr Case I’m sorry I
haven’t been able to get back to
you I was just getting ready to do
that now

She pulls a stack of files off a chair

PATRICE
Please have a seat

He does Fidgets looks at his hands
DR CASE

I’m here about a recent admit
Alan Foster

IN THE CAFETERIA

Erik and Claire set their trays down at a corner table the
cafeteria thinly-populated with the NIGHT SHIFT CREW

Erik digs in Claire doesn’t touch her food She’s shaken
Watches in quiet astonishment as Erik eats unfazed

ERIK
Salt please

She slides him a salt shaker

ERIK
Thanks

He glances up reads the film of shock on her eyes

ERIK
Don’t wig out on me Claire Focus
you need to stay on top your game
if we’re gonna get through this

He shovels in a forkful of hospital-grade meatloaf Claire
just sits there Numb

He sighs puts down his fork OK OK
ERIK

You think there was something you
could have done back there

She answers with a quiet glare maybe she does

ERIK
Those guys didn’t die because of
anything you did or didn’t do They
died because we killed them So cut
yourself some slack This isn’t
about youif it wasn’t you would
just be someone else

Claire looks at the handful of other STAFF in the cafeteria
CLEANING CREW a couple NURSES a few DOCTORS Some
chatting some smiling Others tired or bored

--all of them oblivious to her private hell

CLAIRE
Then why is it me Why isn’t it
someone else

ERIK
Because we needed someone with the
proper motivation and you have it
You would do anything for him

Claire’s eyes welling at the mention of her father

ERIK
»and you’re reliable
Predictable Everything by the
book All the boxes get checked

CLAIRE
You don’t know a thing about me

Erik smiles he knows enough

ERIK
You still think you can save her
don’t you Or people like her That
why you’re always first one in
last one out Taking every extra
shift Double triple-checking
everything

Claire shakes her head Trying to hide that his words are
finding their target

CLAIRE
I don’t know what you’re talking
about
ERIK
Losing a mom so youngjust
throws everything out of balance
doesn’t it

He sees his words are having an effect leans closer
Tightening the screws

ERIK
And since then you’ve been trying
so hard to reset that balance

Claire’s eyes brimmingchurning

ERIK
I understand I do
(because)

With mine it wasn’t cancer She
was gunned down Like a dog While
I watched

HALLWAY OUTSIDE ROOM 314
As Barstow steps from his room Utterly transformed

ERIK (VO)
--while he watched

He’s wearing an ID tag white doctor’s coat over scrubs
even a stethoscope

ERIK (VO)

Was my uncle Leo who finally gave
us up gave ‘em what they needed
for a warrant They came in so
harddragged us outside threw us
in the mud My dad told me just to
lay down

Barstow walks between Zeke and Scully without a nod and
strides down the hallway like he owns the place

ERIK (VO)
That’s when she pulled in the

drivewayback from the grocery
store

IN THE CAFETERIA

Erik’s intensity strangely mesmerizing Almost trance-like
Claire can’t look away

ERIK
they told her to stop She saw
her husband her son guns in our
faces What was she was supposed to
do
(shaking his head)
She didn’t stop

IN THE HALLWAY
Barstow walks with tunnel-vision past random hospital STAFF

ERIK (VO)
»So one of them opened fire
Shredded the car with
government-issue lead

Barstow glances at room numbers slowing A fire roiling in
his eyes

IN THE CAFETERIA
Erik’s eyes and voice dripping with raw contempt

ERIK
A civil servant gunning down a
woman in cold blood Just
following procedure Just doing my
job

He shakes his head

HALLWAY
Barstow stops outside Room 314 He knocks steps inside--

ERIK (VO)

And he walked Killed her and
walked scot fucking free One
stroke of the pen from a judge is
all it took

FOSTER’S ROOM
--and shuts the door behind him He looks at the bed
Sees Foster lit by the flickering blue of the television

ERIK (VO)
And that’s what tonight is all
about Setting things right

A half-smile creases Barstow’s lips

ERIK (VO)
Re-setting the balance

CAFETERIA
Erik still swimming in the memory So real

ERIK
I broke loose ran for herthey
told me to stop My souvenir from
that night

Erik pulls down the collar of his scrub shirt revealing a
gruesome SET OF SCARS that criss-cross his shoulders and
collarbone and spread into his chest

ERIK
Buckshot Double oughtcourtesy
of the Chicago PD
(letting his shirt back up)
Most of it’s still in there I can
actually set off metal detectors
it’s a great party trick

He looks at Claire gives her a wry smile Maybe she gets it
now

CLAIRE
That’s a terrible thingit is
But that doesn’t mean what you’re
doing is--

ERIK
(don’t try)
--this isn’t something you can talk
me out of You can’t finesse me
We’re in this now to the end Just
keep your head in the game

Erik goes back to his food And for a moment Claire sits at
a loss What now

--so she does what she knows opens Barstow’s chart starts
reading Erik reaches over and shuts it

ERIK
And what does that matter at this
point

CLAIRE

He’s still my patient isn’t he
You saw what happened in the OR
You want me to act like his doctor
or not

Erik shrugs whatever She opens the chart

FOSTER’S ROOM

Foster looks away from the TV to Barstow’s approaching
silhouette it’s dark can’t quite make him out

FOSTER
(changing channels)
You white-coat clowns have anything
new to tell me

Barstow taking slow steps towards him doesn’t respond

FOSTER
You hear me

Barstow just inching closersilent

That’s oddFoster finally looks really looks at his
visitor It takes him a little while the realization moving
over his face in stagesbut Foster finally recognizes him

FOSTER
You

Face ashen He’s just seen a ghost

FOSTER
(shock turning to fear)
What the hell

Foster scrambles up in bed as Barstow draws the Sig from his
coat pocket

BARSTOW
Relax Alan Don’t make this
difficult

Barstow sits on the chair next to the bed weapon on his
lap Still Coiled

BARSTOW
Wasn’t sure you’d recognize
meit’s been a while hasn’t it

I doubt you’ve given me a second
thought in quite some time

Foster’s eyes racing from Barstow’s Sig to the door what
are his options

BARSTOW
Of course I’ve had time to think
about you

FOSTER
II don’t understandyou

BARSTOW
(shrugging)
Life no parole right Then what am
I doing here

Foster silently frantic Trapped in a nightmare
FOSTER
Christwhat in God’s
namelisten to me for
crissakeit was a mistake

Foster’s hand drifts towards the nurse CALL BUTTON

FOSTER
--they looked into it they cleared
me--
BARSTOW
(re the call button)
--don’t

Foster’s hand freezes

FOSTER
We couldn’t see in the car

Foster’s eyes pleading A long dread-filled silence

BARSTOW
You see the irony of the
situation which I have had a long
time to contemplate--to really
think about--is that you--

FOSTER
--it was one of your partners for
all we knew--

BARSTOW
--is that you are the public
servantand I’m the criminal

Barstow lets it hang how fucked up is that

FOSTER
It was an accident It was a heavy
situation it was dark--

FOSTER
--oh I’ve done things sure But I
served my time Paid my debt

FOSTER
--I didn’t have a choice -- we
couldn’t see in the car--

BARSTOW
--but I’ve never shot a child
Never killed a woman

Foster stops the protests Knows their futility He swallows
hard What now

BARSTOW
The badge saved you back then Let
you spill blood and just walk
away

Barstow leans forward Their faces inches apart

BARSTOW
(a whisper)
Where’s your badge now

A thick SILENCE Just Foster’s ragged breathing and the
BEEPING monitors

--when Foster THRASHES for the call button and starts to
scream but Barstow is on top of him pinning him down
hands around his throat--

--Foster’s mouth still open in the aborted scream as Barstow
shoves a bandage into his mouth--

--Foster struggling thrashing but Barstow has him pinned
hand cupped over his nose -- Foster’s eyes BULGING in
desperation as Barstow snuffs the life out of him--

--warning BEEPS coming now from Foster’s heart and 02
monitors Foster weakening not much left--

Barstow slips the heart rate monitor off Foster’s finger and
places it over his own the machine returning to normal
parameters silencing the warning tones

Barstow watches as Foster finally goes completely limp His
eyes marbled in death

Barstow pulls the bandage from Foster’s sagging mouth puts
it in his pocket then slips the monitor off his finger and
onto Foster’s and quickly leaves the room

IN THE HALLWAY

He’s already turned the corner and disappeared as the NURSES
react to the FLATLINE ALARM coming from the room

IN THE CAFETERIA
Claire reads Barstow’s chart her face darkening

ERIK
(reading her expression)
Malignant Inoperable They said
three months tops

CLOSE ON the contents of the chart as Claire scans them CT
scans MRI pathology reports

ERIK

Bad huh

(she nods)
One thing about my father that you
won’t find in there he finishes
what he starts And he’s not dying
in a cell There’s nothing left for
him beyond what happens tonight

A beat as the meaning of these words sink in for Claire
Erik SCRAPES the last of his food off the plate

CLAIRE
I want to talk to my father
(pause)
Please

Erik looks her in the eyes Reads the emotions welling
there He seems to be considering the request--

BZZZ Erik checks his phone

ERIK
Well speaking of
(texting a response)
You’re keeping him alive for the
moment That should be enough

CLAIRE
(don’t cry)
Please

NURSE (0S)
Dr Haskins

Claire turns startled to see one of the DESK NURSES from
the ICU

NURSE
(holding out a script pad)
Sorry to bother you I was
wondering if you could sign off on
this script for Mrs Richardson

CLAIRE
Sure

Claire scribbles on the pad out of the corner of her eye
sees Erik still distracted with his cell

NURSE
(turning)
Thank you

CLAIRE
Just a minute

The nurse stops turns

CLAIRE
I need to write one more

Claire scribbles frantically rips the page off and folds it
in half before handing it to the nurse

CLAIRE
This is for Mr Walter

NURSE
Mr Walter

CLAIRE
Yeah Bigger guy bit of a limp

Claire’s eyes BORING into hers are you getting this

NURSE
(unsure)
You mean the sec--

CLAIRE
--yes him

Erik puts his phone away Watching them closely now

CLAIRE
(leave now)
Thank you

The nurse walks away shaking her head What was that

BZZZZ Claire looks down another page She stiffens as
reads it this one got her attention

PATRICE’S OFFICE
Patrice leans forward across the desk Alert on edge

PATRICE
--wait wait What do you mean you
admitted him under duress

DR CASE
This man--he threatened me He told
me to admit Foster to Sinai--

PATRICE
--threatened you how

BZZZZ Patrice silences her pager without looking at it
More important things going on here

DR CASE
I--I don’t know exactly He came to
my office for a physical--it was
terrifying He had pictures of my
wife my children

He shakes his head voice quaking

DR CASE

So I called Foster said I wanted
to reschedule his annual saw him
and then admitted himfor

(flustered searching)
»-possible meningitis or something
along those lines I figured it’s
just a hospital admit what’s the
worst that could happen

she

PATRICE
Have you gone to the police

DR CASE
(startled)
No--no This is my family for
Gods sake I’m not going to risk
that What do I know about this

KNOCK KNOCK

They look up to see a breathless NURSE at the door

NURSE
We’ve got a ten-twenty Room 329

PATRICE
(realizing)
Oh Christ

DR CASE
(panicked now)
What is it Is it him

PATRICE
(standing)
Wait here please

ROOM 329-MOMENTS LATER

Patrice storms into the room finds a small throng of
hospital STAFF around the bed Claire and Erik among them

It’s like a calm after a stormthings returning to normal
after a frantic scene

PATRICE
What happened here

NURSE
We’re not surewe heard the
alarm called the code team They
tried but
(shrugging)
-he was just gone

PATRICE
When

NURSE
Ten minutes ago

Patrice struggling to make sense of this

PATRICE
Claire

CLAIRE
Just got here

Claire’s leaned over the bed looking Foster over no
visible bruising or wounds

She pulls back his eyelids freezing at what she sees the
eyes are BRIGHT PINK from burst vessels

CLAIRE
(to Patrice)
Dr Watkins

Patrice walks over to Foster leans over looks at the eyes
She tenses oh shit

Her eyes meet Claire’s over the bed this is bad Patrice
turns to the rest of the staff

PATRICE
OK I want everyone out Don’t take
anything don’t touch anything

Claire turns to Erik as Patrice corrals the confused staff
out of the room She walks to him her voice quiet fury

CLAIRE
What did you do

ERIK
(who me)
I was in the cafeteria with you

Claire’s near a breaking point Another life gone On her
watch

Patrice turns sees the two of them She snaps to attention
something is obviously wrong here

PATRICE
One of you want to tell me what the
hell’s--

Claire storms past Erik on her way out of the room

CLAIRE
It’s himit’s him
PATRICE
What is him--
(following)
--Claire

Patrice and Erik follow her into the--

HALLWAY
--and towards Barstow’s room

CLAIRE
He did this

PATRICE
Who did this Claire

Zeke and Scully tense as they see the trio approaching
hands drifting towards their sidearms ready for anything

They look to Erik he gives them a subtle shake of the head
stand down For now

Claire barges past them followed by Patrice and then Erik

They burst into the room to find--

ROOM 314

--Barstow lying in bed In his gown handcuffed The model
patient He looks up curiously at his visitors

Patrice glances at Zeke and Scully nothing out of the
ordinary here

Claire freezes shocked and silent This can’t be

PATRICE
(walking towards bed)
Mr Barstow I’m Patrice Watkins
Chief of Medicine here at Sinai I
apologize for the intrusion

BARSTOW
What’s going on

His eyes grazing Erik’s before landing on Patrice

PATRICE

Nothing you need to worry about
It’s the holidays my staffs been
working some long hours

(eying Claire)
--are under a lot of stress But
we’re monitoring your situation
closely and well get you taken
care of as soon as possible

BARSTOW
OK

PATRICE
Is there anything I can do for you
right now

BARSTOW
I’d just like to get some rest

PATRICE
Of course

WITH CLAIRE

Her eyes locked on the bathroom door as Patrice’s voice
fades and blurs into background noise

CLOSE ON the door knob as Claire fixates on it

-She turns sees Erik watching her Knowing what she’s
thinking

---she’s on the verge of opening that door ripping the veil
off the whole thing

-when she sees a thin trail of SMEARED BLOOD on the tile
floor just inches from the tip of Patrice’s shoe

--Claire looks up to Patrice doesn’t she see it Patrice
continues talking to Barstow

Claire opens her mouth to say something turns from Erik
to Zeke and Scully they’re watching her from the
cornersshe’s surroundedSUFFOCATING

--She closes her eyes
-and COLLAPSES
Claire slumps against the wall and slides towards the floor

Erik is closest to her and grabs her just before she smacks
against the tile
ERIK
Whoa Dr Haskins Are you OK

She struggles to her feet

CLAIRE
I’m fine

ERIK
You sure

She shoves him away

CLAIRE
I said I’m fine

She rubs her temples closes her eyes
»-opens them to see Patrice in her face

PATRICE
Outside

IN THE HALLWAY-MOMENTS LATER
Patrice has Claire cornered

PATRICE
Go home Claire Right now When
was the last time you slept

CLAIRE
I still have a patient--

PATRICE

--not anymore you don’t You’re
tired you’re making mistakes
You’re acting crazy frankly

(pause)
You think just because of where he
came from he had something to do
with that

Patrice shakes her head disappointed not like you

CLAIRE
I’m sorry I just thoughtmaybe
he--

PATRICE

--thought maybe he what The man
almost died in your operating room
(MORE )

PATRICE (contd)
He just had the whole Piccadilly
fucking Circus barge in on him with
an appendix that could burst any
minute

CLAIRE
Patrice please--

PATRICE
Go home Right now I’m locking you
out of the system We’1ll talk about
this when you get your head on
straight

CLAIRE
Patrice--

PATRICE
(turning to Erik)
--e-and you Something about your
shit stinks to me You want to
finish your third year be in my
office in five minutes ready to
talk straight

ERIK
Yes ma’am

Patrice turns and stalks back towards the chaos outside
Foster’s room Erik turns to see Claire shuffling away
stopping at the elevators

The doors open and she steps in He sprints to join her--

IN THE ELEVATOR

--making it in just as the doors close Claire stands sullen
and silent She hits the button for P2

ERIK
What are you doing

She doesn’t answer it’s obvious enough

ERIK
We’re not finished here

CLAIRE
I am

ERIK
We’re finished when I say we’re
finished
Claire is balanced on a knife’s edge of sanity -- it’s too
much Gone too far
CLAIRE

What else do you want from me I
can’t do this anymore

ERIK
One more job Claire Then it’s
over I need one room number
that’s all
(pause)
Patient’s name is Jack Pearce

The realization flashing across Claire’s face as she hears
the name The pieces falling in place

She tries to cover but Erik’s seen it she knows

ERIK

Admitted yesterday Compound leg
fracture internal bleeding He was
in the ICU but they moved him this
morning

(reading her)
--you know who I’m talking about
don’t you

Claire shakes her head

ERIK
You can find him for me

Claire digs deep digging for everything she has to look
him back in the eye and shake her head no

CLAIRE
--you heard her she locked me out
I can’t get into the system
anymore I can’t even show my face
on the floor how do you expect me
to--

--when Erik SPRINGS forward and SLAMS Claire into the wall
so fast she doesn’t even know how she got there

His hand around her throat Hissing into her face

ERIK
Think outside the box Claire You
can find a way

She claws at his hand as his fingers dig deeper
ERIK
(a whisper)

One room number

Her eyes bulging cords straining in her neck looking into
his eyesand not blinking She shakes her head no

CLAIRE
(no air fighting to get the
words out )
No -- one -- else -- dies
Erik releases her and she doubles over heaving

He rips his phone out of his pocket shoves it in Claire’s
face as she sucks in air it’s the familiar image of Alden

But this time Erik presses a button on the phone and the
frozen image starts MOVING silent video footage showing

ON PHONE’S DISPLAY her father being beaten Viciously

Two large MEN take turns wailing on Alden his hands lashed
behind his back

Claire’s hand flies to her mouth in a silent scream

ERIK
You still want to go this way

One of the MEN (we may recognize him as Zeke) holds Alden up
by his hair shoves his beaten face closer to the camera

ERIK
Still want to play tough Be the
hero

A HAND shoves the barrel of a handgun into Alden’s mouth --
his eyes pleading--

Claire trembles silently as Erik dials
ERIK
(into phone)

Yeah How’s our friend

Claire watches him hatred pouring from her eyesbut she’s
standing firm Staring him down

Erik looks at her you sure you want to do this

ERIK
(into phone)
We’re deciding that right now

DING The elevator stops the doors open
It’s Walter
Claire’s heart in her throat at the sight of him

She braces herself for what’s comingthis could be
itWalter’s eyes move between her and Erik

WALTER
(nodding)
Doc Haskins

He steps in the elevator pushes the lobby button Turns and
faces the doors Casually whistles Silver Bells

Claire is silently crestfallen no no no

--her eyes land on the GUN on Walter’s hip move to Erik
holding the phone to his ear then back to the gun

»maybe she could pull it off Just maybe

but Erik’s watching Shakes his head don’t even think
about it

ERIK
(into phone eyes on Claire)
It’s looking like we’re going to
have to go ahead and terminate that
case

Claire finally breaks Can’t do it She nods to Erik OK

ERIK
(into phone)
On second thought we’ll get back
to you about that No action is
necessary right now

He hangs up Awkward silence in the elevatorjust Walter’s
goddamned whistling

WALTER
(turning)
Oh I got your prescription doc

CLAIRE
(surprised hopeful)
You did

WALTER

(chuckling)
Yes ma’am

He pats his pocket the still-folded paper sticking out
WALTER
And I do appreciate it Mrs Walter

will appreciate it too

He winks at her Claire closes her eyes Jesushe didn’t
even read it

DING The elevator stops Walter tips his hat to Claire and
shuffles into the lobby whistling Silver Bells
continuing his rounds

ethe doors shut and they’re alone again

ERIK
So what do you say Claire

Her eyes on the floor Shoulders sagged Weary

CLAIRE
This is the last job

ERIK
Yes

CLAIRE
Just a room number and it’s over

ERIK
Yes
CLAIRE
You’ll make that call and let him
go
ERIK
Yes
She turns to Erik holds his eyesreading him

Her eyes moving to the scar tissue peeking out from his
collar then back to his eyes Can she believe him

CLAIRE
(finally)
OK

She hits the second floor button

CLAIRE
I can get it in radiology

RADIOLOGY HALLWAYS-MOMENTS LATER

They walk briskly through the quiet hallways of radiology
passing X-Ray rooms emptied desks dark rooms They stop
Claire opens a door into a--

DARKENED ROOM

--which they cross stopping at a second door Claire opens
it revealing some sort of booth It’s all dark and shadows
we can just barely recognize this as the same imaging room
from before

Erik watches as Claire starts to step into the booth

ERIK
That’s not where the radiology
charts are kept

CLAIRE
No but I can

She stops in the doorway turns how did he know that And
it hits her

CLAIRE
Foster

ERIK

You’d be surprised how invisible a
janitor is around here How easy it
is to swap a few charts some lab
work and

(snapping his fingers)
-a perfectly healthy person
suddenly becomes a very sick one

Claire’s eyes flicker with recognition she could have
caught it Could have figured it out

--no time for that now Have to keep moving She turns
eases into the booth

CLAIRE
They have imaging records in
here
(shuffling through papers)
-here it is Pearcemoved to
six thirty-seven

She flips a wall switch but the booth stays dark

ERIK
Six three seven

CLAIRE
Yes it’s in ortho

ERIK
Show me

She hesitates -- is she bluffing She holds the print-out
for him to see He reaches for it then turns at the

THUNK THUNK THUNK THUNK

noise behind them It’s a giant open-style MRI machine
humming to life

ERIK
Claire

She steps out of the booth standing next to Erik as she
shuts the door it’s locked now

She starts inching away from him

ERIK
What are you doing

THUNK THUNK THUNK THUNK
ERIK
(raising voice over machine)

That’s it Game over Claire

He rips his cell phone out of his pocket dials -- the
machine getting LOUDER

ERIK
YOU JUST KILLED HIM YOU JUST
KILLED YOUR OWN FATHER

He looks at the phone’s display confused the numbers are
faded and smeared It’s not working

Then Erik’s necklace starts

LEVITATING IN THE AIR

--the necklace slides up his neck the initials EB floating
tugged by an invisible hand--

--Erik’s eyes growing wide in confusion and astonishment--

--as Claire lunges forward from the wall and WHACKS the cell
phone out of his hand--

--and the phone actually DANGLES in the air before ZIPPING
ACROSS THE ROOM into the MRI chamber shattering--

--Erik slack-jawed -- what the fuck is going on -- the
machine getting even LOUDER--

--and he falls to his knees collapsing and SCREAMING in
pain -- clutching his shoulder in agony as the machine
wreaks havoc on the lead buried in his soft tissue--

EXTREME CLOSE ON the skin over his chest and shoulders We
can actually see the metal fragments moving under his skin
Erik looks on in horrified confusion--

--as Claire sprints from the room slamming the door shut
behind her--
IN THE HALLWAY

--she shatters the glass to the fire alarm and pulls the
handle -- it starts WAILING

She runs to--

AN EMPTY DESK

--and grabs the phone taking it with her under the desk
Crouched hidden

She stops for a moment closes her eyesthe number the
numbergot it

She opens her eyes dials It rings Rings again

MALE VOICE (FILTERED)
Yeah

CLAIRE
Let him go It’s over

MALE VOICE (FILTERED)
(pause)
Who’s this

CLAIRE
I SAID LET HIM GO
Claire presses the phone to her earlistens closerwhat
is that

It’s an ALARM barely audible in sync with the pulsing
noise and flashing lights of the alarm she just pulled

Whoever’s on the phone is in the hospital

MALE VOICE (FILTERED)
I said who is this

She hangs up

OUTSIDE ROOM 314
Zeke hangs up his cell Confused concerned
ZEKE
(to Scully)

They exchange a look the call the alarmwhat’s going on

IN ROOM 314

Barstow sits up in bed as the fire alarm continues to
shriek He pulls the cell from the duffel bag dials Gets
nothing

IN THE MRI ROOM

Erik drags himself across the floor towards the door Every
movement agony

IN ROOM 314

Barstow flings the phone in frustration against the wall
The fire alarm still SHRIEKING

He deliberates for a moment before reaching in the duffel
bag pulling out the Sig and heading into the--

HALLWAY
--shutting the door behind him
BARSTOW
(to Zeke and Scully)
We move

They nod Almost seems part of the plan

Zeke disappears down the hallway and Scully marches
alongside Barstow in the opposite direction

BARSTOW
Well start in orthopedics
UNDER THE DESK

Claire is still crouched and hidden dials another number

IN THE HALLWAY

Erik finally makes it out of the room slamming the door
shut behind him collapsing against the wall Clutching his
shoulder in pain

He gasps for breath eyes on fire scanning the hallways
Where is she

He begins the hunt

ELEVATORS ON THE SIXTH FLOOR

Barstow and Scully step out of the elevators and walk into--

ORTHOPEDICS
--as Barstow draws his weapon Scully following suit

The first of the PATIENTS and HOSPITAL STAFF see the pair
approaching begin SCREAMING and ducking for cover

BARSTOW
JACK PEARCE

CRACK CRACK

Barstow fires shots into the ceiling and walls to clear
their path as NURSES ORDERLIES PATIENTS scatter

IN SINAI’S SECURITY OFFICE

The hospital’s HEAD OF SECURITY grimaces as the phone rings

useless piece of shit

ERIK (0S

)
CLLLAAATIIRRRRREEE

The shriek of a wild animal Her head snaps towards his
voice he’s close

DOWN THE HALLWAYS

Erik stumbles away from the lab ripping open doors--
--murder in his eyes He turns the corner--

--sees the desk the receiver dangling from the cord--
But no Claire

DING He jerks to the sound of elevator sprints for it--

--rounding the corner and just catching a glimpse of Claire
as the doors slide shut
IN ORTHOPEDICS

Barstow and Scully are throwing open doors weapons leveled
looking in on TERRIFIED PATIENTS

No Pearce They continue their search

OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL

Fire and emergency vehicles stream onto the site blue and
red lights blazing

POLICE OFFICERS block the doors CRUISERS block the
entrances and exits to the parking garage

This place is locked down

IN ORTHOPEDICS

Barstow and Scully continue their search room-by-room
when--

CRACK

--Scully goes down -- Barstow whirls into a crouch and
turns sees

WALTER

with his weapon drawn in shaking hands -- Walter squeezes
off another round but it goes wide--

--Barstow stays ice-cold and buries three rounds into
Walter’s chest -- then one in his head--

--more MAYHEM and SCREAMS as Walter flails backwards dead--
--Barstow turns and leaves Scully bleeding in the hallway
continues his search solo door after door--

INTERCUT

ERIK IN THE STAIRWELL

sprinting up the stairs two at a time

CLAIRE IN THE ELEVATOR

repeatedly hitting the six button

CLAIRE
Cmon c’monJesus Christ

As the elevator stops on the fourth floor The doors open
two RESIDENTS join Claire in the elevator

RESIDENT 1
Third false alarm this weeksuch

Claire manically smashes the door close button The
residents eye her curiously

IN ORTHOPEDICS

Barstow continuing his search when his eyes laser in on

Barstow drags Patrice to the administrative desk addresses
a young and terrified NURSE her face buried in her hands

BARSTOW

NURSE BARSTOW
Room six-oh-six THREE
And the fire alarm finally shuts offleaving a ROARING
SILENCE on the flooronly Patrice’s labored breathing

She closes her eyes waiting for it

But Barstow just smiles releases her He turns away
quickly orients himself to the room numbers He’s close

He strides down the hallway untouchable

He stops outside Room 606 Opens the door--

IN ROOM 606

--and steps inside walks down the narrow passage along the
bathroom wall sees a LEG IN A CAST hanging over the bed
pins protruding from the shin

Barstow allows himself a half-smile he has the right room
Barstow approaches the bed his eyes landing on Pearce’s

face Grim Set Pearce meets Barstow’s eyes seems oddly
unsurprised to see him

Barstow’s eyes move to Pearce’s pregnant daughter Danielle
(from the drink machine) seated by the bed clutching her
father’s hand quaking with fear

She closes her eyes pressing out tears that slide silently
down her cheeks

Barstow raises his weapon Finally This is it--

--Danielle opens her mouth to SCREAM when--

CLAIRE STEPS FROM AROUND THE CORNER IN FRONT OF HIM

--her hands flying to his chest -- Barstow looks down just
in time to see DEFIBRILLATOR PADDLES as Claire squeezes the
trigger--

WA-CHUNK

Barstow SPASMS and flies backwards--

CRACK -- the gun goes off -- cobwebbing the window--

Barstow collapses against the wall -- the gun skitters
across the floor--

--Claire drops the paddles and grabs the gun trains it on
Barstow as he violently COUGHS and sucks in air--
IN THE HALLWAY

Erik frantically searches for room 637 It’s not there He
double-checks the room numbers they stop at 636

Goddammit He looks around which room The whole floor is
in a state of chaos people running hiding

Down the hall he sees HOSPITAL SECURITY and then CHICAGO PD
arriving Shit

He sees a small cluster of HOSPITAL STAFF huddled together
behind the main desk

He joins them tries to blend in

IN ROOM 606

Barstow takes a few deep breaths coughing struggling to
his feet

He stares down Claire still training the gun on him His
eyes wild voice rasped and sharp

BARSTOW
Are you sure that’s an instrument
you’re ready to use doctor

Her hands are rock solid Barstow takes a small step towards
her -- Claire takes a small step back

Danielle clutches her father’s hand -- her breathing rapid
and shallow She tries to suppress a GROAN of pain looks
down to her belly in worry

CLAIRE
You’re not going to lay a finger on
him

BARSTOW

This doesn’t involve you doctor
(nodding to Pearce)
He’s paying for what he’s done
Danielle’s GROANS grow louder her breathing more panicked

CLAIRE
Stay right there

BARSTOW
I’ve come too far to stop now
IN THE HALLWAY

Erik watches as UNIFORMED COPS and then SWAT TEAM spill onto
the sixth floorbulletproof vests serious firepower

Patrice points them towards Room 606
Erik turns for the exit sees two COPS at the double doors
leading out of the unit They block a protesting PHYSICIAN

trying to leave

COP
No one in or out

Erik’s trapped

IN ROOM 606

Barstow takes another step towards Clairestill pointing
the gun her hands quaking

BARSTOW
Just step aside doctor

Behind Claire Danielle is crying out in fear and pain

CLAIRE
(eyes still on Barstow)
It’s OK Danielle The stress is
causing some early contractions
Everything’s fineyour baby’s

Barstow takes another step closer

BARSTOW
Just step aside and it’1ll be over
soon

CLAIRE

Hold her hand Judge Let her
squeeze it

He does Danielle and Pearce cling to each other just
Claire separating them from the approaching Barstow

BARSTOW
(another step)
I’m dying anyway
(nodding to gun)
That means nothing to me

Another step closer

CLAIRE
Close your eyes Danielle Slow
deep breathsyou’re doing great
(to Barstow)
I told you to stop

She takes small steps back as he approaches He’s just a few
feet away

BARSTOW
You want me to stop you’1l have to
pull that trigger
OUTSIDE THE DOOR
Four SWAT TEAM MEMBERS assemble Led by CULLEN (40s) jaw
set He lives for this shit Silent hand gestures exchanged

with the rest of the team

They quickly fall into a close quarters combat formation

INSIDE THE ROOM
BARSTOW
You’re a doctor Claire You help
people This isn’t you

He’s backed her all the way against Pearce’s bed when

--Claire turns as she hears the door KICKED OPEN and BOOTED
FOOTSTEPS storming towards them--

--she turns back and catches a glimpse of Barstow CHARGING
and she closes her eyes and squeezes the trigger

CRACK

She opens her eyes to see the hole she just shot in the wall
-- Barstow’s vanished -- where

CULLEN (0S)
EVERYONE ON THE GROUND

--Claire turns just in time to see Barstow raise his elbows
and leap into the cobwebbed window--

--CRASHING through it--

OUTSIDE THE WINDOW

As Barstow flails and drifts with the broken glass
towards the whirling red lights six floors below
the falling shards of glass catching the light from the
sirens and gleaming red against the canvas of his green
scrubs in a macabre Christmas tableau

--until

THUD

IN ROOM 606
The SWAT team swarms the room

CULLEN

Claire drops the gun slumps with relief

CULLEN

Cullen’s eyes furiously moving then locking on Claire
standing just beyond Walter’s body

with Walter’s gun to her neck

The gun held by Erik He was one of the hospital workers
kneeling by Walter’s body

Cullen reaches for his weapon--

ERIK
Leave it

Cullen’s hand freezes
ERIK
You trying to get her killed
cowboy youre off to a good start
Meanwhile a SCORE OF SWAT TEAM and CHICAGO PD have
responded crouched weapons drawn and trained on Erikbut
no one has a clear shot

Erik slides sideways back against the wall with Claire
pressed tightly in front of him as a human shield

Cullen holds out a flattened palm to his team hold fire

Erik presses the gun into Claire’s neck walks her slowly in
front of the wall of firepower leveled at them

ERIK
(whispering)
Just take it easy Claire We’1ll

CULLEN
Building’s surrounded Locked down
Just put the weapon down

It’s a room full of itchy trigger fingersbut still no
clear shot Erik doesn’t flinch

ERIK
You say one more word and I spray
her head onto the wall

A little faster please

Twisting the gun harder into her neck as they slide along
the wall the SWAT team following at a cautious distance as
Erik pulls Claire through double-doors leading to the--

ELEVATOR LANDING

CLAIRE
Where’s my father

ERIK
Down button please

She presses it with a trembling finger as Erik looks up into
the concave corner mirrors sees twisted images of the SWAT
team following Inching closer

ERIK
That was some clever shit with the
MRI Hurt like hell

CLAIRE
He’s dead you know
(pause)
Your dad

ERIK
We knew it might end here

But it still hits hima flicker of emotion crossing his
eyesbut it’s quickly gone

He focuses his anger on the elevator button Hits it again

CLAIRE

ERIK
--what the fuck is taking so long--
CLAIRE
--SO WHY ARE YOU STILL DOING THIS
TO ME
ERIK

(calm eyes on the mirror)
Because right now you’re my ticket

AROUND THE CORNER

The SWAT team draws closer watching Claire and Erik in the
mirrors

Silent hand motions exchanged as--

ELEVATOR LANDING

--Claire and Erik wait the final moments before the elevator
arrives It’s almost there when--

THHWWPPP

--a hissing sound from their blind side coming from two
TEAR-GAS GRENADES that skitter along the floor and land at
their feet and--

EXPLODE in a cloud of gas

--Erik spins and fires blindly in the direction they came
from and they’re quickly engulfed in smoke and gas--

--as SWAT team MEMBERS round the corner and crouch into
firing positions--

CULLEN
Clean shots only

POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE as a SNIPER tries to track them
losing their silhouettes in the haze--

--Erik and Claire both COUGHING and RETCHING eyes burning--

--Erik blindly squeezes off more shots as he drags Claire
towards the elevator--

POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE MUZZLE FLASHES from inside the
cloud as Erik fires momentarily illuminating them -- giving
the sniper just enough light--

--and the sniper FIRES--

--one of the silhouettes doubles over hit We can’t see
whether it was Erik or Claire when--

--a devastating peal of NOISE and WHITE LIGHT as a stun
grenade explodes in front of the elevators--

--gas mask-wearing SWAT team members storm into the smoke
just as the elevator doors DING shut--

--the gas thins revealing Erik and Claire--
Gone

CULLEN

IN THE LOBBY
A small army of more SWAT TEAM and CHICAGO PD surround the
elevators a wall of bullet-proof vests and heavy arsenal

leveled at the elevator doors

ALL EYES GLUED on the lights as the elevator descends the

DING The doors open revealing

An empty elevator

SWAT TEAM MEMBER
(into walkie)
Elevator’s empty

SIXTH FLOOR LANDING

Cullen wordlessly takes this news impossible

-then as the smoke clears his eyes move to the door now
revealed ten feet to the right of the elevators Stairs
IN THE STAIRWELL

Erik drags Claire up the stairs at gunpoint both of them
still coughing lungs burning eyes red and watering

He stumbles as they round a landing streaking the wall with
blood he’s hit

ELEVATOR LANDING

The SWAT team charges through the door and up the stairs
after them

THE ROOF

Erik and Claire burst through the door onto the roof Erik
dragging Claire towards a Pegasus Life Flight helicopter

its rotor whirling to life

Zeke is waiting in the pilot’s seat

IN THE STAIRWELL

The SWAT team continues charging up the stairs following
the blood trail

AT THE HELICOPTER

As Erik and Claire brace themselves against the windstorm
The two men shout over the ROAR of the rotors

ZEKE
WHERE’S SCULLY

ERIK
HE’S NOT MAKING THE TRIP

ZEKE
THE FUCK HE ISN’T

ERIK
(moving towards the door)
WE MOVE NOW

ZEKE
WE’RE NOT LEAVING WITHOUT HIM

Erik spins and looks towards the stairwell door they’1ll be
here any second

ERIK
WE DON’T HAVE TIME FOR THIS WE
LEAVE NOW

ZEKE

I DIDNT SIGN ON FOR THIS SHIT
WE’RE NOT LIFTING OFF WITHOUT--

--when his face disappears in a cloud of pink as Erik shoots
him point blank in the face

He opens the door and drags Zeke’s body onto the tarmac
ERIK
(turning to Claire)

IN

Shoving her at gunpoint--

INTO THE CHOPPER

--where she lands hard in the cockpit Erik clambering in
after her--

--when she hears something A labored breath A soft GROAN--
Claire spins around to see

HER FATHER

in the patient transport area of the cabin hands lashed
behind him to the fuselage Ankles taped together Mouth
duct-taped Face bruised and blood-matted

CLAIRE
Dad

She lunges towards him rips the tape off his mouth

ALDEN
Claire

Eyelids fluttering He struggles weakly against his
restraints half-conscious

Claire softly touches his face

CLAIRE
God what did they do to you--

Erik grabs her by the hair and viciously pulls her back into
the co-pilot’s seat

ERIK
(waving gun)
Face front

Erik does a quick check of the control panel toggles
switches grabs the control stick He’s done this before

He turns looks at the medical carts in the cabin it’s an
ambulance in the sky

He coughs winces He’s weakening and trying to hide it He
points to his wound

ERIK
Patch me up Claire It’s your last
job
Claire turns towards Alden
CLAIRE
(reaching for him)
Dad
Erik yanks her by her collar

ERIK
I said fix me

Erik gritting his teeth as the chopper WOBBLES and takes to
the air just as--
ACROSS THE ROOFTOP
--Cullen and the SWAT team explode through the door and race

across the roof -- watching helplessly as the chopper
vanishes into the sky

IN THE GLITTERING CHICAGO SKYLINE

As the chopper swoops low almost grazing the buildings

IN THE CHOPPER

Erik at the controls coughing Wincing He’s hurting bad
losing blood

ERIK
Better hurry Claire or we’re all
going down together

Claire digs frantically through the equipment grabbing
vials syringes bandages

ERIK
Hurry the fuck up

She turns to Erik pulls up his shirt and inspects the
wound his entire back smeared with blood

CLAIRE
Lean forward

Erik grunts in pain as Claire pushes him roughly forward
CLAIRE
Well it went all the way
through

She swabs the entrance and exit wounds with bedadine-soaked
bandages

CLAIRE
--SoO that’s good news

Erik hisses through clenched teeth as she works

ERIK
Jesus Christ

CLAIRE
Hold still
ACROSS THE CITY

Chicago PD helicopters take to the air darting and swooping
through the glittering spine of lights

ON THE HIGHWAYS BELOW

A fleet of Chicago PD black-and-whites race across the
freeways tracking the chopper from the ground

INTEXT POLICE CRUISER

The PATROLMAN cranes his neck looking up through the
windshield

COP
(into receiver)
We have visual on the target
Approximate location twelve hundred
block of Halsted heading north

IN THE SKY

The Chicago PD choppers bank change their course

IN THE CHOPPER

Claire treats Erik quickly -- no wasted movement He winces
as she mercilessly packs the wound with gauze

Claire finishes dressing the wound CUTTING strips of tape
with paramedic scissors pressing the tape over the gauze

Erik glances down at the tiny lights of the police cruisers
following from the groundso far away Insignificant

Claire fills a syringe Brings it towards the wound

ERIK
What’s that

CLAIRE
Local anesthetic You’1ll be
thanking me in about thirty
seconds

As she jabs the needle directly into the wound Erik
flinches Jesus that hurts

CLAIRE
(slowly injecting)
So that’s what this was all about
Killing a couple old men Settling
old scores

She almost sounds disappointed Like she expected more

ERIK
It’s about re-setting the balance
making things right You should
understand that

CLICK CLICK as Claire fills another syringe tapping it with
her fingernail

CLAIRE
(off his look)
Steroids

She plunges the needle into his abdomen near the wound

CLAIRE
(pressing the plunger)
And how does killing innocent
people make anything right Those
guardsWalterwhat did they do
(nodding to her father)
What did he do

She removes the syringe She’s looking at him hard now

CLAIRE
Erik listen to me--

ERIK
--you think tonight was just about
making you jump through some hoops
You do your jobs and go home
(shaking his head)

It wasn’t just the guy who pulled
the trigger Claire And it wasn’t
just the judge who let him walk

Claire starts to respond then stops herself Where’s he
going with this

ERIK
it was an Assistant DA out to
prove what a Big Fucking Man he
was taking down Claude Barstow

Beat as this revelation washes over Claire’s face Sickened
Understanding now She wasn’t chosen at random at all

ERIK
You want to tell her about it
Alden

Claire turns to her father his face a bloodied mask
Groaning quietly

ALDEN
(groggy )
I was justdoing my jobyour
father was a criminal
ERIK
(gun on Claire’s temple)
--SHUT UP SHUT THE FUCK UP OR I
BLOW HER HEAD OUT THE WINDOW
The chopper pitches sharply as Erik loses focus

Erik recovers looks ahead through the windshield at the
dark expanse of Lake Michigan guiding the control stick--
IN THE SKY

--and the chopper banks sharply easily leaving the
black-and-whites behind following the coastline east

ethe city lights fading behind them

IN THE CHOPPER
Erik seems to be stabilizing Back in control

Claire looks back at his father bloodied weak His eyes
void of hope She blinks back tears

CLOSE ON her right hand still holding the paramedic
scissors

Her hand FLEXES on the handle She turns to Erik
CLAIRE
Land the helicopter Erik Right

now

He ignores her his eyes focused through the windshield
He’s looking for something

CLAIRE
Take us down Now

He scoffs quietly -- then catches a glimpse of her out of
the corner of his eye Christ she’s actually serious

ERIK
And why would I do that

Erik’s eyes finally lock in on what he’s looking for
IN THE SKY

The chopper banks and descends riding low over the
shoreline

IN THE CHOPPER
No tremor in Claire’s voice as she continues

CLAIRE

Because I injected you with 50 cc’s
of Diazepam It’s not an
antibiotic it’s a sedative I cut
it with some ketamine so it’s
taking a while to kick in

(hardening)
»-but it will kick in It was
enough to knock out a fucking
horse So land the helicopter

Erik shakes his head nice try Nice but desperate
ERIK
Why would you do that I’m the one
flying this thing You want to die
with me
CLAIRE
Youll feel a heaviness in your
extremities first it’1l move fast
from there Put us down
He just holds her eyes she’s bluffing Has to be

CLAIRE
(checking her watch)
Youve got maybe two minutes

His cocky smile slackens He looks down at his hand
now Flexes it Is it just in his head

His eyelids flutter for the briefest moment
ERIK’S POV as the SOUNDS BLUR and the IMAGES SHIFT

CLAIRE
Feeling it now

Hell yes he is His eyes frantic he’s fucked

curious

ERIK
Make it stop

CLAIRE
I can’t--

ERIK
--YOU CAN

CLAIRE
--IT’S TOO LATE

Erik looks ahead through the windshield and we finally see
where he’s headed--
BELOW THE CHOPPER

--a dilapidated series of docks and berths on an abandoned
waterfront industrial park

It’s a good spot Isolated hidden

And perched among the rotting wood and corrugated metal
buildings moored to a dock is a gleaming 1000 hp GO-FAST
BOAT Ink-black nearly invisible

IN THE CHOPPER

Erik struggles with the control stick as he brings the
chopper down

they’re so close he’s going for ithis head nodding
consciousness slipping fast

--Claire and Alden hold tight as the chopper WOBBLES

e-Erik blinkinggritting his teethfighting it

HOVERING OVER THE DOCKS

The chopper’s landing skids hover just feet now from the
narrow docks

IN THE CHOPPER

Erik’s almost there almost home

---but he finally loses it slumps forward over the
controls

Claire lunges for the control stick but it’s too late--

OVER THE DOCK

--as the landing skids catch the side of the dock and the
helicopter pitches sideways into the water--

--the WHIRLING ROTORS slashing the water in a hellacious
EXPLOSION OF WATER

--the force crushing the chopper like a beer can--

--the windshield SHATTERS -- the cab SPLINTERS at the seams
rivets POPPING like bullets--

INSIDE THE CHOPPER

--Alden is defenseless on impact his head SMACKS against
the fuselage starts spilling blood--

--as icy black water GUSHES INTO THE CAB through the seams--
--the chopper’s pitching sideways and sinking--
--Erik still unconscious strapped into the pilot’s seat--

--as Claire thrashes from the cockpit into the cabin still
clutching the SCISSORS--

--she reaches the woozy and bleeding Alden as the water
surges and rises around her--

--she takes a deep breath dives--

UNDERWATER

--dark and murky -- she finds and cuts the tape lashing him
to the fuselage cuts the ankle ties swims up and--

INTO THE AIR POCKET

--and GASPS for air sees her father -- his lips purple
eyelids heavy--

CLAIRE
DadDad C’mon stay with me

--he’s coming to but still weak -- Claire claws her way
with Alden towards the shrinking air pocket forming in the
cockpit as the chopper tips even further--

--she struggles against the passenger door throws her
shoulder into it it doesn’t budge--

--she swivels her legs under her and kicks the glass with
her heels Kicks it again It cobwebs She kicks it again--

--finally kicking through it -- creating an opening big
enough for one but water is now GUSHING THROUGH IT--
CLAIRE
(turning to Alden)

Come on
He hesitates That’s not how it’s supposed to be

CLAIRE
You’re hurt Go

--water rising fast -- not much time -- Claire and Alden
each take a final breath of air --

--as the cab TOTALLY FILLS WITH WATER--

--she helps him through the front seat and out the broken
window -- his hands still lashed together but he can at
least tread water--

--when behind Claire--

ERIK’S EYES OPEN

--as he’s jolted awake in the icy water--

--Claire starts following her father out the window just as
ERIK’S HAND LASHES OUT and grabs her wrist--

IN THE LAKE

--the chopper sinks like a rock--

--leaving Alden alone at the surface watching helplessly as
it disappears taking Claire with it--
IN THE CHOPPER

--Erik and Claire struggle desperately -- he’s still
strapped in taking her down with him -- she claws at his
fingers but his grip is a vice--

--they’re eye-to-eye the dark water GLOWING from the
control panel lights--

--as they sink deeper--

IN THE CHOPPER
Erik’s not letting go -- Claire still fighting weakening--

--when she summons a final burst of strength from
God-knows-where and peels Erik’s hands away--

--just as his mouth and lungs fill with water -- his eyes
slacken and go dim--

--as Claire swims through the window out of the chopper--

INTO THE DARK WATER

--struggling for the surface as Erik and the chopper sink
below her into blackness--

--and she finally EXPLODES through the surface of the water
GULPING the air--

--looking up into a HALO OF LIGHT that finds her and Alden
as the police and rescue helicopters descend on the scene
AFTERWARDS

The docks are crawling with EMERGENCY PERSONNEL and
vehicles Chicago PD cruisers helicopters fire trucks

Claire and Alden sit in the back of an ambulance wrapped in
thermal blankets attended to by a pair of MEDICS

Claire leans forward brushes her father’s hair back wants
to get a better look at that scalp

ALDEN
Thought you didn’t like treating
lawyers
Claire’s LAUGHTER stops the crying before it can really
start the stress and fear finally turning to relief he’s
banged up but he’1ll be OK They’1l be OK

CLAIRE
I don’t Just the good ones I
guesswhen I can find them

The MEDIC gently takes her hand from her father’s head lets
her know with a look it’s OK I’ve got it from here

Alden winks at Claire squeezes her hand as the Medic slips
an oxygen mask over his mouth A third MEDIC SHUTS THE DOOR
and the ambulance drives off

--as we pull up and away looking over Lake Michiganthe
constellation of LIGHTS from the scene playing on the lake’s
surface

-it could almost be a Christmas tree the halogens the
blues the reds

--catching and rippling on the water

FADE OUT
