FADE IN

EXT CHICAGO - LAKESHORE DRIVE - LATE NIGHT

Rain comes down in buckets A MOVING TRUCK is parked out
front of a Gothic pre-war APARTMENT BUILDING Stone
gargoyles sit perched above Thunder crashes bringing us to-
INT APARTMENT 313 LIVING ROOM

Dark wood High ceilings As charming as a haunted mansion
The rooms are filled with over-stuffed MOVING BOXES

As WE PAN ACROSS the boxes - we SEE strange artifacts from
around the world SHRUNKEN HEADS TRIBAL MASKS an EGYPTIAN
SARCOPHAGUS

LIGHTNING FLASHES to REVEAL - the last items still on the
shelf DOZENS of LEATHER-BOUND MANUSCRIPTS fitted with steal

locks A HAND reaches into frame

A LANKY MOVER and pulls down an arm load of books and hands
them over to a BURLY MOVER who

-drops them unceremoniously onto a hand truck

VOICE (0S)
Careful you imbeciles

They both startle as we REVEAL

-a mysterious figure in the shadows - we will know him
later as SHIVERS

SHIVERS
Those books are more important than
your lives

The movers exchange curious glances as Shivers disappears
into the darkness They then notice

the apartment is badly damaged Broken floors Shattered
walls

BURLY MOVER
Looks like a bulldozer went through
this place and he’s worried about
dropping a book

EXT - STREET - MOMENTS LATER

The Lanky Mover stands on the truck’s lift gate The Burly
Mover tosses a box in his direction The Lanky Mover drops
the box spilling

THE MANUSCRIPTS onto the street
BURLY MOVER
Dude wake up

The Lanky Mover jumps down from the truck to help pick up the
manuscripts

He looks at a few of them - each bound with a sturdy
REINFORCED LOCK Among the titles

LANKY MOVER
“Monster Blood” “Werewolf of Fever
Swamp” “Haunted Mask” Hey I
read these when I was a kid

The Lanky Mover grins with dumb nostalgia

BURLY MOVER
You can read

The Burly Mover holds one of the books “The Night of the
Dummy” - its lock dangling open

BURLY MOVE
Great Now look what you did The
lock’s busted

LANKY MOVER
Should we tell him

BURLY MOVE
Hell no Dude’s psycho

The Burly Driver scans the scene for prying eyes then tosses
the book back in the box placing it in the truck

He slides closed the truck’s delivery door as LIGHTNING
FLASHES bringing us to

EXT - ABANDONED COUNTRY ROAD - LATER THAT NIGHT

Rain falls harder Thunder crashes louder The moving truck
follows the Apartment Owner’s distant car

LANKY MOVER (0S)
It’s weird man Really weird

INT MOVING TRUCK - CONTINUOUS
Lanky Mover drives while Burly Mover reads a magazine
LANKY MOVER
Who hires a moving company to move
out in the middle of the night
BURLY MOVER
Same guy who puts dead bolts on
some old books

A LOUD RUMBLING NOISE is heard from the back of the truck
The two movers eye each other anxiously

EXT ABANDONED ROAD

The moving truck pulls over to the side of the road

EXT MOVING TRUCK

The back doors are pulled open as the movers peer inside
Darkness peers back The Lanky Mover switches on his
flashlight revealing

»-a wall of boxes One of them has fallen over

LANKY MOVER
Hello Somebody there

Silence Flashlight pans off the box to the mess of books
that poured out of it Suddenly catch a glimpse of

A SMALL PERSON

LANKY MOVER (CONTD)
(startled freaked)
Holy crap There’s a hobbit or a
damn dwarf back there or somethin’

BURLY MOVER
Shut up Prolly a cat snuck in

LANKY MOVER
A cat wearing pants

BURLY MOVE
(disconcerted peers in)
Hello
(silence)
If you don’t come out we’re coming
in

Beat Nothing

INT MOVING TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

They enter the cab with their flashlights The person is
still not moving They walk up to it as the Lanky Mover
gulps nervously and they shine the flash light on

A creepy VENTRILOQUIST DUMMY He wears a red carnation A
mischievous grin is frozen on his face - like a naughty child
with a secret

Sigh of relief from both of them
BURLY MOVER

It’s just some kind of
ventriloquist dummy Man
4a

Just then the dummy’s eyes OPEN He turns and speaks in a
sinister voice THIS IS SLAPPY

SLAPPY
Who you calling dummy

The Movers eyes widen Their faces go white Just as

The truck’s steel door suddenly SLAMS SHUT

EXT MOVING TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

SCREAMS of terror as the truck shakes bringing us to

TITLE CREDITS

As CREDITS roll a series of GOOSEBUMPS BOOK COVERS
kaleidoscope across the screen “The Haunted School” “It
Came From Beneath the Sink” “The Girl Who Cried
Monster”Just to name a few Endless tales of terror
The titles spin and swirl faster and faster until-
TITLE CREDITS END

engrossed in a movie playing on an Ipad

ZACH stares out the passenger window at the landmarks of
his new hometown

THROUGH PASSENGER WINDOW - TRAVELING

A sign reads WELCOME TO NORMAL POPULATION 28245

INSIDE CAR

Zach starts to look increasingly concerned

EXT MAIN STREET - ZACH’S POV - TRAVELING
It’s a small generic sleepy town

Zach gets a look at the TOWN HALL
-THE INDOOR ICE SKATING RINK

and THE VILLAGE SQUARE Even Norman Rockwell might die of
boredom here

INSIDE THE CAR

Zach is now completely alarmed He turns to Gale

GALE
Isn’t it cute

ZACH
Doesn’t Miami need Vice-Principals
Or LA Detroit Anywhere
EXT MONROE STREET - DAY
A residential street lined with tall trees homes and big
yards Mini-van pulls into the driveway of their new home
EXT COOPER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY
The Coopers climb out of the car and take in their new digs
A typical cookie cutter suburban two-story house
Gale sports a hopeful smile
GALE
Look Zach - a house this size
would cost millions in New York
ZACH
That’s because people actually want

to live in New York

Zach studies the house with unease

INT - NEIGHBOR’S HOME

An UNSEEN FIGURE watches from above

INT - COOPER’S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH

Not much better on the inside Everything in various states
of disrepair

The Coopers step inside just as a RACCOON rushes out the
front door Startled Gale SCREAMS

MELISSA
Kitty cat

Zach eyes his mother Gale smiles weakly
GALE
You always wanted a pet

INT - KITCHEN - LATER

Gale stands at the kitchen sink She turns the faucet

GALE
Nope Still nothing

Under the sink Zach is trying to work the pipes with a
wrench

Suddenly a pipe bursts and he is drenched in dirty brown
water He GROANS and leaps to his feet wiping his face

ZACH
I told you I couldn’t fix it

GALE
Well you and your father fixed the
leaky faucet in the bathroom all

the time

ZACH
He fixed the faucet I held the
wrench

GALE

It’s no big deal We’1ll call a
plumber tomorrow

Zach nods - but she can see he is dispirited

GALE
We can save so much money living
here And we have family here

Just then as if on cue

LORRAINE (0S)
Oh my goshhhhhh Look at you

Zach and Gale follow the voice into the living room where

Gale’s bubbly fortysomething sister LORRAINE is hugging
little Melissa Clearly the “country mouse” to Gale’s “city
mouse” Lorraine is overjoyed to the point of tears

LORRAINE
She’s so big And beautiful She
looks just like her Auntie

(to MELISSA)
Here sweetie I made you a little
denim handbag with rubies and
sapphires Don’t you love it

Everything Lorraine owns is bedazzled to nauseam She’s an
arts and crafts person with too much time on her hands

Lorraine crosses and gives Gale an emotional hug
LORRAINE
I can’t believe you’re really here
(in tears blubbering)
I’m so happy

GALE
Well it’s all thanks to you

LORRAINE

(wiping her tears)
I’ve sat through so many School
Board meetings it’s the least they
could do You’re going to turn
that school upside down I just
know it

Lorraine spots Zach

LORRAINE
Oh my goodness Look how handsome

ZACH
Hey Aunt Lorraine

Lorraine gives Zach a welcoming hug

LORRAINE
You look just like your father
I mean youre like a man You’re
the man of the house

She smiles sweetly at him but Zach just shuffles
uncomfortably at this notion then-

ZACH
I’1l go unload the car

Zach heads out leaving Gale and Lorraine to catch up

EXT DRIVEWAY - DUSK
Zach is unloading boxes from the U-Haul when-

HANNAH (0S)
Your house is haunted you know

Zach turns to see a fourteen year-old girl (HANNAH) in the
upstairs window of the neighboring house Dark-hair Pretty

HANNAH (CONTD)

The last owner was an escaped
mental patient who chopped up his
entire family with a rusty
Cuisinart On moonlit nights you
can still hear the sounds of his
victims being pureed

Silence in the air

HANNAH (CONTD)
I’m kidding He was a florist
Hannah smiles warmly Zach manages a smirk

ZACH
You got me

HANNAH
What’s your name

ZACH
Zach from New York

HANNAH
Hi Zach from New York I’m Hannah
Welcome to the neighborhood How
do you like it so far

ZACH
(shrugs)
It’s all right I guess

HANNAH
(playful)
Oh just all right

ZACH
Well it’s getting better

SHIVERS (0S)
Hannah

Mr Shivers appears beside Hannah - his dress is out-of-date
like a professor from a distant decade There is a forboding
air about him

SHIVERS (CONT’D)
Get back to your homework

Hannah slinks away

Shivers sticks his head out the window addressing Zach
venomously

SHIVERS (CONTD)
See that fence

Zach eyes the WROUGHT-IRON fence that divides the property
line He nods

SHIVERS (CONT’D)
Its private property Sos
everything on the other side of it
That includes my niece Remember
that and we wont have any
problems

Shivers retreats back inside drawing the blinds as he goes
Zach exhales disturbed
EXT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Zach returns with a box passing Gale and Lorraine on his
way

ZACH
Neighbor just bit my head off
(beat)
And they say New Yorkers are rude

Lorraine looks across the yard to Shivers’s house

LORRAINE
Mr Shivers He’s VERY good-
looking I think But I have first
dibs Gale I’ve been single a lot
longer than you

Gale LAUGHS as Zach enters the house

INT - ZACH’S ROOM - NIGHT

Filled with boxes All still packed One marked “DADS STUFF”
is opened Inside the box lies a slew of photos and awards
including a NYFD MEMORIAL PLAQUE dated the previous year

We FIND a glum Zach sitting against some boxes watching an
old home movie A video camera is hooked up to his computer

ON COMPUTER SCREEN - ZACH’S DAD the fire chief gives orders
to a group of men

ZACH’S DAD

Joe Danny I want you to hit the
fire head on Go high in the
ceiling and don’t let up til you
see the sky

(to CON ED WORKER)
Frank I need you to cut the power
and gas to the entire block

(to a POLICE MAN)
Sarge let’s clear the sidewalks

(to the CAMERA
Sorry guys that includes you

The camera pans away to the asphalt and the movie ends
Zach looks at an old photo

ON PHOTO - Zach’s Dad receiving a community medal He is
surrounded by BIG GROUP of grateful citizens We can see

young ZACH looking proudly on

Zach tosses the photo back in the box and slides the entire
box under his bed

EXT - NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL - NEXT MORNING

Morning outside Normal High SERIES OF SHOTS
LU

THREE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS pass around a big can of HAIR SPRAY
spraying their hair themselves the sky

TWO JOCKS in jeans compare biceps

A TWERPY KID sits on the lawn completely engrossed in a nose-
picking session

We FIND Zach walking through the crowd taking it all in

He passes a PATROL CAR parked outside the school TWO COPS
(BROOKS STEVENS) are dead asleep snoring in their vehicle

ZACH
(under his breath wry)
Well I feel safe

INT CHEMISTRY CLASS - MORNING

The soporific Chemistry teacher MR CAMPBELL stands before a
class of slack-jawed sleepy students

MR CAMPBELL
(in a drone)
We all have different fears -
snakes rejection final exams
babies But they all have one
thing in common Who knows the
chemical component of fear

Zach looks around - all the students are zoning out -
doodling flossing eating their hair

Mr Campbell picks up an ENERGY DRINK off his desk

MR CAMPBELL
Here’s a hint It’s the active
ingredient in an energy drink

ZACH
(raises his hand)
Epinephrine

All the Students turn and stare at Zach
MR CAMPBELL
That’s right Very good
(furrows brow)
Who are you
ZACH
Oh I’m Zach Cooper It’s my first
day I’m from New York
Feeling everyone’s eyes on him Zach smiles self-conscious

Half the Students look amazed the others confused
MR CAMPBELL
(sleepy)

Ll

I could use a little of this stuff

right about now

Mr Campbell guzzles his drink
out of place

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Zach is feeling increasingly

Zach is at his locker when a blond cheerleader ALLISON

approaches

ALLISON
You’re from New York
like

What’s that

(before he can answer)
I went to Baltimore once I’m
Allison I’d like to go to New

York one day - here it

gets a

little same ol’ same ol’ Although
last year one of the barns burned
down It was crazy It was a

really big barn

Suddenly Allisons jock boyfriend DAVIDSON emerges from
behind her He gives Zach an angry stare

DAVIDSON
You think you can just

come into

town and hit on our chicks man

ZACH
Excuse me

DAVIDSON
(dumb imitation)
“Excuse me”

Davidson’s posse of JOCK BUDDIES
guffaw and join in

JOCK 1

all meatheads and bulky

(another angry imitation)

Exceh-kuyou-es-meeee

JOCK 2

(mouth dangling hostile)

Excuuuuuuse meh
Jock 2 actually drools a little

ZACH

Zach is baffled

I would say number one wins best
imitation but number two gets
points for originality and number

three for drooling
LZ

DAVIDSON
You think you’re better than us
Well I got ten friends that say
otherwise

Davidson fans his ten fingers in front of Zach’s face then
curls them into tight fists

DAVIDSON
My friends want to give you a big
WELCOME TO TOWN

Davidson retracts both fists looking to punch Zach

Suddenly a hulking African-American fourteen year old
DWAYNE pushes between Zach and Davidson

DWAYNE
I need to get to my locker

Dwayne gives Davidson a severe look Davidson and his boys
immediately back down

DAVIDSON

Hey Dwayne How’s it hangin’
Blind Side You gonna come back to
the football team or what

DWAYNE
I’1l think about it
(in his face)
And don’t call me Blind Side

DAVIDSON

Sure no prob Keep on chill-axing
and well catch you on the
flipside ‘kay brutha man

Davidson and his posse head out with ingratiating grins
Allison lingers for a brief moment - she’s mortified

ALLISON
(to ZACH)
Sorry about that
(to DWAYNE)
Hey Dwayne

DWAYNE
(shy)
Hi
Allison heads out Zach is left with Dwayne

Dwayne gives Zach a reassuring smile Zach grins back

ZACH
Thanks for that

DWAYNE
I moved here five years ago from
Cleveland
Zach nods

Everybody looked at me like I was
an alien They still do

ZACH
Why would they do that

DWAYNE
Only Freshman who weighs two
hundred pounds

ZACH
(stunned)
Youre a Freshman How old are you

DWAYNE
Fourteen
(off ZACH’s shocked look)
That’s why they want me to play
football

ZACH
Why don’t you

DWAYNE
First day of practice I think I
almost killed a kid I guess I
don’t know my own strength

This is a good friend to have

INT CAFETERIA - DAY

Zach and the imposing Dwayne sit together eating their
lunches in the crowded cafeteria

Zach scans the cafeteria for Hannah

Dwayne says nothing but his eyes drift over to

ZACH
Hey - you know a “Hannah” who goes
here Pretty dark hair morbid
sense of humor

DWAYNE
There’s an Anna - but she’s blond -
and cross-eyed - with a gimp leg

ZACH
Nah that’s not her

DWAYNE
You like this Hannah

ZACH
She seems pretty cool It’s weird
she doesn’t go here It’s the only
high school in town How about

(off DWAYNE’s head shake)
Anyone you’re into

Ls

Dwayne scarfs his food

-Allison - she feigns amusement at Davidson and his buddies
antics - but it’s clear she’s not having much fun

DWAYNE
Yeah but she’s got a boyfriend
Anyway I get nervous talking to
girls

ZACH
You nervous If anyone’s
intimidating it’s you
(off DWAYNE’s look)
Just a little bit A tad

We HEAR LOUD FEEDBACK from a microphone People GROAN
plugging their ears

We SEE at the head of the cafeteria PRINCIPAL GARRISON
holding the microphone

PRINCIPAL GARRISON
(lifeless monotone)
A bunch of exciting news today
First I’d like to introduce our
new Vice-Principal Her name is
uh err

We SEE Zach’s Mom standing beside him She whispers to him

PRINCIPAL GARRISON
Ms Cooper Give her a big
welcome will ya

A few lackluster claps

PRINCIPAL GARRISON
Also we will be burying our time
capsule on Friday Come down for
the ceremony right before the Fall
dance We got a lot of great
donations from our community - an
antique typewriter a recording of
a Taylor Swift medley sung by our a
cappella group and a Pomeranian dog

Zach looks around the cafeteria Students mostly stare into
space - no one seems to be listening let alone care

INT COOPER HOUSE - DUSK
Gale is making dinner when a distressed Zach approaches

ZACH
Mom I know we’re all going through
a lot - and I swear I’m trying to
be positive but we gotta get
outta here We can’t live here A
barn burned down last year
1D

GALE

ZACH
That’s all that’s EVER happened A
barn - burned down - last year

GALE

Honey of course this is gonna take
some adjusting But personally
after what we’ve been through I’m
glad we’re out of New York - and
the hectic pace

(pointedly)
-e-and all the dangers Here - you
know your neighbors and you can
leave your doors unlocked at night
and yeah maybe it’s dull but it’s
safe And that means everything to
me right now Be patient Work
with me okay

ZACH
(nods sweetly)
Okay

GALE
Now can you take out this trash

Zach dutifully takes the bag out Gale watches him go

EXT SIDE OF COOPER HOUSE - NIGHT

Zach hauls the bags of trash around the house Lifts the
lids to the trash cans

ANONYMOUS POV - stalking him through the slits in the fence
as he stuffs the cans with garbage bags

Zach stops feeling like he’s being watched

ZACH
Hello

He nervously grabs the cover of the trash can as he
backpedals towards the house

ZACH (CONT’‘D)
Someone there

A branch SNAPS Zach jumps spins around to find
-an amused Hannah squeezing through the fence

HANNAH
You scare really easy

ZACH
Well yeah when you creep up on me
like that What are you doing
HANNAH
I saw you and I thought I’d sneak
out and say hi

ZACH
I’m flattered

HANNAH

You should be TI had to disable
the security system down in the
cellar so I wouldn’t trip the
alarm

(off his look)
My Uncle has me on lock down after
nine

ZACH
Seems like he has you on lock down
twenty-four seven

HANNAH
(wry smile)
I have my share of fun
(shrugs)
But being home schooled does get
old after awhile

ZACH
No wonder I didn’t see you at
school

HANNAH
(grins playfully)
Aww you were looking for me

ZACH
(sheepish)
Maybe

HANNAH
How was it

ZACH
What school
(shrugs )
You’re not missing much

HANNAH
You don’t like

ZACH
This town’s just kinda boring

HANNAH

She gives him a sly wink then takes his hand

EXT MONROE STREET - FEW BLOCKS AWAY - NIGHT

Hannah walks briskly Zach keeps pace Unsure

HANNAH

She darts off the sidewalk and into

EXT FOREST - CONTINUOUS
They pass trees and over-grown shrubbery

ZACH
Where are we going

HANNAH
Stay close I don’t want get
blamed if they have to send out a
rescue party

She disappears behind a tree
Zach momentarily alone gets spooked

ZACH
Hannah

He starts to run toward the tree then peers around it just
in time to find

An excited Hannah slipping under a rusted fence

HANNAH
You can thank me later

EXT ABANDONED AMUSEMENT PARK - MOMENTS LATER

Zach and Hannah are now approaching an abandoned amusement
park Decrepit CARNIVAL RIDES litter the run-down scene In
the center - a broken-down FERRIS WHEEL

ZACH
(amazed)
What is this place

HANNAH
They built it ten years ago to
bring in tourism then the
recession hit Now it just sits
here Awesome right

Hannah hops a turnstile and begins to climb the FERRIS WHEEL

HANNAH
Race you to the top
Ld

ZACH
Wait wait You sure this is safe

HANNAH
I come here all the time What are
you afraid of

ZACH
Falling Dying Getting a tetanus
shot

She keeps climbing the Ferris wheel He takes a deep breath
mustering his courage then follows

The two quickly make their way to the top of the rickety
Ferris wheel

EXT FERRIS WHEEL - TOP CAR -—- MOMENTS LATER

Zach and Hannah settle in under the cloudy night sky The
entire town of Normal spreads out below them Stars twinkle
above as electric lights twinkle below

HANNAH
I get claustrophobic in the house
so I sneak out at night I’ve
walked every one of those streets
Isn’t it beautiful

He watches her soak in the view He is clearly smitten

ZACH
Yeah It is beautiful

She brightens pleased

HANNAH
What else could you ever need you
know
ZACH
(smiles )
I dunno maybe like people who

know me Friends

HANNAH
Youll make friends

ZACH
Won’t be the same
(off her look)
I lost my dad last year - and now -
moving away - I feel like I’ve lost
my whole world

HANNAH
(locks eyes with him)
I know what it’s like to feel
alone But there’s a whole new
world - right here
Ly
She points down at the town lights below

HANNAH
And it’s more exciting than you
think Trust me

She gives him another mischievous smile They look out at
the city Zach is thoroughly enjoying this

EXT COOPER HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - LATER

Zach and Hannah have returned to the fence between their
homes She shimmies through the hole

ZACH
Hey Hannah
(she turns back)
I can take out the trash the same
time tomorrow night if you
know you want to sneak out again

HANNAH
Are you asking me on a date

ZACH
(flummoxed )
What No I mean what

HANNAH
Zach I’m kidding
(smiles )
It’s a plan

A figure suddenly appears behind Hannah grabbing her
shoulder

SHIVERS
You Where were you

Hannah GASPS startled
Shivers is furious his gaze fixed on her

HANNAH
I’m sorry

SHIVERS
Getinthehousenow

Hannah throws Zach a parting glance then slinks away
Through the fence Shivers gives Zach a murderous look

SHIVERS (CONTD)
I don’t know what brought you here
or where you’re from but my advice
to you is - leave Crawl back to
the sewer from whence you came
You are not welcome here

Even with the fence between them Zach feels vulnerable
ZU

GALE (0S)
Zach you out there

ZACH
That’s my mom I’d invite you over
to meet her but you seem tired
(gulps air)
Maybe another night

Zach takes a few steps backwards still mesmerized by
Shivers then turns and runs

EXT NORMAL HIGH - ESTABLISHING

INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

Zach is at his locker having just told the story of last
night to Dwayne

DWAYNE
Youve been in town two days and
you already had a date

Dwayne glum throws a look to
Allison passing by laughing with her CHEERLEADER pals

ZACH
Nothing’s ever gonna come of it
She’s home schooled - in a prison
with a security alarm and an Uncle
Voldemort Do you know anything
about this guy Shivers

DWAYNE
I’m not sure He lives up on
Crested Butte Does he wear an old-
timey Count Dracula coat

ZACH
Yes That’s him What do you know

Zach takes his books out of his locker lost in thought

EXT COOPER HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Leaves flutter as trees shake
INT COOPER HOUSE - KITCHEN

As Gale prepares to bring a garbage bag outside Zach eagerly
grabs it

ZACH
That’s okay I got it

GALE

take out the trash before

Zach heads out

EXT SIDE YARD - MOMENTS LATER

Zach is at the trash cans waiting He peers into the
darkness All is quiet

ZACH
(hushed)
Hannah Hannah

He waits a few more moments before giving up Disappointed
Zach stands and turns back toward the house

Suddenly A GIRLS BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM pierces the night

Startled Zach spins around Did he really just hear that
And then as if on cue--

The SCREAM is heard again Coming from next door

As Zach scans Shivers house for the source of the SCREAMS he
sees

SHAPES and SHADOWS hurriedly move behind the curtains
We HEAR glass BREAKING Wood SNAPPING And then
A ROAR Guttural Primal Ferocious

Zach goes white And then as the strange HORRIFYING ROAR
reaches a fever pitch-

Silence resumes as the light in Shiverss house goes out

Frozen Zach stands in his driveway in disbelief

INT COOPER KITCHEN —- MOMENTS LATER

Sitting in her high chair Melissa makes a playful mess as
Gale fixes the sink using a “Plumbing For Idiots” guide

Suddenly Zach rushes in in a panicked frenzy

ZACH
Mom Did you hear that
ZL

GALE
Hear what

Gale listens Not so much as a cricket chirps

GALE
Look honey I fixed it

She turns the faucet - water is flowing

ZACH
Mom Someone’s in trouble I
think it’s Hannah

Zach grabs the house phone He dials 911

GALE
Who’s Hannah

ZACH
(into phone)
Hi this is Zach Cooper - I live on
Crested Butte Lane

GALE
Zach you’re scaring me What is
going on

EXT SHIVERS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH —- LATER

Knock Knock The front door opens to reveal Shivers holding
a glass of Scotch looking annoyed

Zach Gale and OFFICER BROOKS and STEVENS are on the porch

OFFICER STEVENS
Uh Mr Shivers

SHIVERS
Yes

OFFICER STEVENS
Im Officer Stevens and this is
Officer Brooks Your neighbors here
seem concerned there might be some
kind of a domestic disturbance

Shivers gives Zach a quick withering look

SHIVERS
What in the world is a domestic
disturbance

OFFICER STEVENS
Umm a domestic disturbance is

it’s inside the house and uh

Officer Stevens turns to Officer Brooks for help
Z5-

OFFICER BROOKS
It’s like basically theres
something wrong going on inside
your house Your young neighbor
man here said he heard a series of
screams

OFFICER STEVENS
From a girl or a woman or a lady

SHIVERS
Well there’s no girl or woman here
- not even a lady I’m alone
watching TV so if you’ll excuse me
Officers I’m sure there’s a cat in
a tree somewhere that could use
your help

Suddenly a WOMANS SCREAM echoes through the house
The officers exchange looks Zach appears vindicated
Stine moves to close the door but

Officer Brooks blocks it with his foot

OFFICER BROOKS
Wed like to take a look around the
premises if you don’t mind

Shivers sighs then ushers them inside the house

INT - SHIVERS HOME LIVING ROOM

A WOMAN screams in terror as a half-sharkhalf-spider
mutation (known as a SHARK-RANTULA) pursues her

A MUTE button is hit as we realize that the images come from
a TV screen Shivers and the others stand inside

SHIVERS
Surround sound I just hooked it
up this morning

GALE
(sighs relieved)
Mystery solved Mr Shivers I’m

OFFICER BROOKS
Well be outta your hair now Mr

ZACH
Wait he’s lying He’s not here

All eyes turn back to Shivers

SHIVERS
Hannah is my niece She was staying
with me for a while until her
parents got settled overseas And I
caught this boy on two occasions
sneaking over the fence to watch
her undress in her room He’s a
trespasser and a pervert

OFFICER STEVENS
(to ZACH severe)
Son you been peeping

ZACH
No

SHIVERS
(to the Officers)
Anyway she’s no longer here With
all this unwanted attention from
the neighborhood degenerate I
thought she’d be safer with her
parents in Beirut

OFFICER STEVENS
Beirut

Zach scoffs in disbelief Stevens turns to him

OFFICER STEVENS
Hear that You got some poor girl
sent to Egypt

Officer Brooks notices state of the art security system on
the wall the reinforced bars on the windows

OFFICER BROOKS
Quite a security system you got

SHIVERS
Still couldn’t keep certain
deviants at bay

OFFICER BROOKS
Not to mention your home media set
up Ever have people over for the
Super Bowl or March Madness or

SHIVERS
If I do I’ll be sure to send an
invite your way

Shivers sports a condescending smile Officer Brooks
brightens at the thought
2D

ZACH
(approaches the COPS)
Look he’s a liar She snuck out
to see me And what I heard was
not a TV There was a scream and
then a roar Like a lion or a
tiger or

SHIVERS
(acid)
A lion Fascinating Do tell

All eyes fall on Zach Suddenly Zach is starting to sound as
stupid as he feels

GALE
You never mentioned anything about
a lion Zach

SHIVERS
(exasperated)
Now I’ve been patient long enough -
and if you don’t leave my house I
will call the actual police

OFFICER STEVENS
We are the actual police

SHIVERS
For the sake of this community I
pray to God that’s not true

OFFICER BROOKS
So is the Super Bowl party off

Zach takes this moment to make a Hail Mary play

ZACH
Hannah Hannah

OFFICER STEVENS
Okay kid thats enough

As the officers escort the struggling Zach to the door

Shivers watches Zach get dragged off with a snide smirk

INT SHIVERS ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER
The Officers have escorted Zach to the door

ZACH
He’s lying His niece isn’t in
Beirut - she’s here

OFFICER BROOKS
Right - and she’s being fed to a
lion
ZO

OFFICER STEVENS
You know we could arrest you for
disorderly conduct buddy

ZACH
Arrest me Someone’s in danger

An irate Gale steps between them

GALE
Zach Go home
(off his look)
I mean it

Zach sighs then exits the house
Gale tries to smooth things over with the cops

GALE
You know we just moved here and
he’s been through a lot

OFFICER BROOKS
I’m sure he’s a good kid Could he
be inhaling stuff around the house

OFFICER STEVENS
Patio sealant computer duster
bath salts

OFFICER BROOKS
Rubber cement whipped cream

GALE
It’s not drugs I know what it is -
and I’m going to take care of it

She gives them an emphatic look

INT COOPER KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Gale returns to find Zach aggravated pacing the kitchen

ZACH
Mom - I know what I heard

GALE

Zach I’m not an idiot

(he stops cold)
Yesterday I tell you the reason we
came here was because I wanted to
live somewhere safe - and the next
day this We’re not leaving you
know that right You need to
accept that this is your home now
Please don’t make more problems for
us than we already have

Gale gives him a meaningful look then exits the kitchen
Zach looks out the kitchen window He quickly notices
that

Shivers is watching him from next door in an upstairs
window lurking behind a drawn curtain

Shivers locks eyes with Zach then abruptly close the
curtain

EXT NORMAL HIGH - CAFETERIA - AFTERNOON
Zach and Dwayne eat together in the cafeteria

ZACH
He’s more than overprotective he’s
a psychopath I tried Googling him
yesterday - there’s no Shivers in
Maryland - there’s nothing I’m
worried that Hannah could be in
real danger you know We’ve got
to help her

DWAYNE
We

ZACH
I need help - and you’re the only
friend I have

DWAYNE
I hardly know you

ZACH
Come on Dwayne We’re gonna sneak
into his house and we’re gonna find
out what’s going on

DWAYNE
What if he’s there

ZACH
You told me on Friday nights he
goes to Ray’s Diner and eats

filets
DWAYNE
Tonight’s the school dance
ZACH
So You don’t have a date
DWAYNE
(frowns )

Rub it in dick

ZACH
Look I need someone like you -
someone tough and intimidating
(buttering him up)
--a real stud you know - to back
me up
Zd-e

Dwayne sighs Zach puts up his hand and Dwayne reluctantly
high-fives him Zach is pleased

INT COOPER HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Gale holding Melissa talks to Zach on the stairs

GALE
But honey tonight’s gonna be fun
They’re having the ceremony to bury
the time capsule

ZACH
(dry)
They’1ll film it And I can watch
it over and over on YouTube

GALE
But then there’s the school dance
Is it because I’m chaperoning I
will completely leave you alone I
won’t even look in your direction

ZACH
It’s not that

GALE
I even got Aunt Lorraine to babysit
Melissa so you could go

ZACH
I’m gonna hang out at Dwayne’s
house He’s a guy I met at school
I think I actually made a friend
you know

GALE
(softens pleased)
Yeah Good And this Dwayne -
he’s a nice kid

ZACH
(selling it)
Super nice Really cool - a lot of
fun - funny - and we just have a
really good time together

EXT SHIVERS FENCE - DUSK
Dwayne and Zach hide in the dirt by Shivers’s fence
DWAYNE
(not happy)
This is the stupidest thing I ever
did What are we doing out here

Zach forcibly closes Dwayne’s mouth

ZACH
Shh Here he comes

Across the lawn we SEE Shivers exiting the house He
crosses to his car and gets in starting the engine

As Shivers’s car pulls away

WE PAN ACROSS the lawn to SEE Zach and Dwayne sneaking
under the fence and scurrying across the lawn

EXT SHIVERS HOUSE - CELLAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS
Zach and Dwayne head toward the steel cellar doors
Using a knife Zach unfastens the latch on the door jamb

DWAYNE
How do you know there’s no alarm

ZACH
Hannah told me she disconnected it

With a hollow CLICK the latch becomes unfastened

Zach pockets the butter knife and slowly OPENS the creaking
cellar doors

Silence Zach peers down into the darkness below

ZACH
Now all you have to do is stay
here and watch the driveway

DWAYNE
Wait here by myself

ZACH
Yes you’re the look out If
Shivers comes back just go
(cups his mouth)
Ha-hoo Ha-hoo

DWAYNE
Ha-hoo How about
yells)
ZACH GET THE HELL OUT THE HOUSE

ZACH
Okay That works too

Zach tries to muster his courage

ZACH
I don’t know why I’m so nervous
My Dad used to go into strange
houses all the time and rescue
people And those houses were on
fire Piece of cake right

DWAYNE
(shrugs)
I wouldn’t do it
DU
INT SHIVERS’S HOUSE - BASEMENT -— CONTINUOUS

Lens flares as Zach turns on his flashlight Reveal a musty
cellar cluttered with junk Cobwebs hang Spiders scuttle

A rattled Zach gets caught in some cobwebs He swats them
off regains his composure and continues on

As Zach steps forward he accidentally bumps into a broom
The broom falls to the floor when

Snap Snap Snap A series of BEAR TRAPS go off
Zach looks down to see that the basement is filled with them
Zach studies the steel minefield uneasily as-

--an OMINOUS FIGURE appears directly behind him in the
darkness Behind Zach now

A HAND reaches out grabs him on the shoulder Zach spins
around and SCREAMS

We REVEAL the figure - it’s Dwayne He SHOUTS

ZACH
What the hell man You’re
supposed to be outside

DWAYNE

Just because I’m big and black
doesn’t mean I’m not scared of the
dark

(off ZACH’s look)
Look I’ve never told anyone this -
but the reason I quit the football
team wasn’t because I hurt a kid
First practice I was on the field
five minutes I tackled this kid
and yeah I knocked him out - but
it damn nearly broke my nose And
it hurt I don’t like pain Zach

ZACH
(souring)
You don’t like pain You were
supposed to be my body guard here
You’re the worst bodyguard ever

Suddenly a noise is heard from upstairs

DWAYNE
(wide-eyed)
Who’s that

ZACH
(hopeful)
It’s Hannah

Zach heads upstairs Dwayne follows As they climb the
stairs we notice
--a concealed MOTION DETECTOR on the bottom of the
staircase As the two pass by a RED LIGHT goes on
INT RAY’S DINER - NIGHT

Mr Shivers sits alone in the back of the diner reading a
book of Edgar Allan Poe poems A WAITRESS appears

WAITRESS
What can I get you hon

Putting stink on the “hon”s he glares at her indicating the
big “FILET MIGNON FRIDAY” sign over her head

SHIVERS
What do I always get on Friday
hon The filet hon
He returns to his book as the Waitress huffs away

Shivers’s phone VIBRATES

ON PHONE - display is flashing Words read ALARM 3
ACTIVATED

Shivers’s brow furrows

INT SHIVERS’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
Zach and Dwayne slowly enter the dark room Silence
Then more SOUNDS coming from behind DOUBLE DOORS

ZACH
(whispers to Duncan)
In there
(turns whisper yells)
Hannah

Zach pulls open the study doors to reveal
A STUDY
Dusty spacious and stuffed with HUNDREDS OF LEATHER-BOUND
MANUSCRIPTS fitted with steel locks (the same as we saw in
the opening) Bookcase after bookcase is filled with them
Dwayne and Zach move into the dim study taking it in
DWAYNE
(reading book covers)

“The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight”
“The Ghost Next Door” “Night of

the Living Dummy” I know what
these are These are Goosebumps
manuscripts

ZACH

You mean those kids books
SZ

DWAYNE
No kids books help you fall
asleep not keep you up all night
They’re scary man

ZACH
Why would Shivers be collecting the
original manuscripts of a bunch of
kids books

DWAYNE
I dunno But let’s get out of
here I’ve got the creeps

ZACH
Relax

Zach tries to open a book but it’s LOCKED

ZACH
They all have locks on ‘em Weird
(looks at spine)
RL Stine

DWAYNE
That’s the guy who wrote ‘em
He wrote like all of ‘em and then
one day just disappeared

Zach fingers a GOLD KEY hanging on a mount beside the books

ZACH
Disappeared How

DWAYNE
I dunno Anyone writing books
about homicidal gnomes werewolves
man-eating plants and
(reads title)
“The Abominable Snowman of
Pasadena” -— has gotta be a freak

Zach then spots a framed diploma - embossed with the name R
L Stine He looks up

There is a FIGURE standing right behind Dwayne

ZACH
Get down

Zach pushes Dwayne down as a BASEBALL BAT swings for their
heads barely missing Then

VOICE (0OS)
Zach

Lights flip on to reveal Hannah standing there stunned

ZACH
Hannah
S55

HANNAH
What’s going on

Zach and Dwayne rise to their feet

ZACH
Dwayne this is Hannah

DWAYNE
Your girl just tried to knock my
head off with a bat

ZACH
(embarrassed)
She’s not my girl but uh

HANNAH
Zach what are you doing in here
ZACH
I came to rescue you
HANNAH
From what
ZACH
Your uncle
HANNAH

Zach you’ve got it all wrong
okay No one’s supposed to be in
here You have to leave

Hannah kneels down to pick up the manuscripts Dwayne dropped
She stops stunned when she sees

The lock on “The Abominable Snowman” is broken
HANNAH

(to DWAYNE)
You broke open the lock
DWAYNE
Well you almost broke open my head
- well call it even

HANNAH
You don’t understand

Dwayne snatches the book from her

DWAYNE
It’s no big thing I can fix it

Dwayne opens the book so he can fiddle with the lock
Upon seeing this Hannah’s eyes widen in livid horror-

HANNAH
No Don’t open that

But it’s too late With a blast of hurricane wind Zach and
the others are hurled backwards

-while a NEW FIGURE abruptly appears in the room as if out
of thin air

As Zach and the others regain their composure a shadow grows
over the scene growing taller taller

Realizing they’re no longer alone Zach and the others slowly
look up to see-

THE ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN OF PASADENA

Tangled hair Crowded fangs Fifteen feet tall Three
thousand pounds Very real and very pissed off

HANNAH
(calm-whisper)
Nobody move

Ignoring her advice Dwayne loses his shit and HOWLS
The Snowman whirls on Dwayne and
SNOWMAN
(in response)
ROAARRRRR

The room trembles Bookshelves shake Manuscripts dislodge
as Dwayne scrambles to his feet and runs towards the back of
the STUDY

It dead ends at the BARRED-BAY WINDOW Dwayne turns to
see

the ROARING SNOWMAN bearing down on him like a man-eating
freight train when-

Zach knocks Dwayne to the ground

-asS the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena BLASTS through the
bay window

and into the night Steel snaps Glass SHATTERS The
burglar alarm WAILS

Zach and Dwayne on the floor lean up to see a hole where
the bay window used to be

ZACH
Was that real

Hannah appears quickly silencing the burglar alarm and
holding the ABOMINABLE SNOWMAN MANUSCRIPT under her arm

HANNAH
My Uncle’s gonna kill me

With that Hannah quickly rushes into the study
SD

DWAYNE
Her Uncle’s gonna kill her What
about that albino Bigfoot

Zach goes after her Dwayne gets to his feet and follows--
-- we hang back just long enough to notice ANOTHER MANUSCRIPT

has fallen to the floor amidst the chaos It’s spine reads
“Night of the Living Dummy” and its lock is OPEN

EXT SHIVERS LAWN - NIGHT

Hannah moves briskly across the lawn hurriedly following a
trail of destruction

-to the edge of the gate

ZACH
(catching up)
Hannah Wait

HANNAH
Go home Zach I appreciate your
concern - I do - but you’re in over
your head

ZACH
But where did that thing come from

HANNAH
I can’t explain now TI have to go

She takes off following the trail
Zach starts after her until stopped by a freaked out Dwayne

DWAYNE
You heard the girl She wants to
be alone So let’s go get a burger
or something

Dwayne grimaces hopefully

ZACH
It was our fault that thing got
loose in the first place

DWAYNE
Our fault All I did I was drop
the book break the lock and open
it up and there it was

Dwayne grimaces only now realizing what he’s done
ZACH
We can’t just ditch her You said
you would help

With that Zach goes after Hannah
3b
DWAYNE
(calling after him)
Well you didn’t say anything about
an Abominable Snowmen

Dwayne is left alone Getting anxious he starts to run

EXT STREETS - LATER

Car alarms BLARE Smashed fences crumpled mailboxes
Perplexed NEIGHBORS stand outside their porch

The Snowman’s trail of destruction leads right through the
neighborhood towards

EXT ICE RINK - NIGHT

Zach and Dwayne run up to the Ice Rink A section of fence

has been ripped from its hinges The building’s side window
is shattered Spot Hannah climbing through

DWAYNE
That chick’s crazy What’s she
doing We should call the cops

ZACH
Have you met the cops in this
town
Zach takes off for the ice rink

DWAYNE
Fair enough

INT ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT
Dark Deserted Light pours in from street through the
windows near the rafters See overturned ARCADE GAMES

CRUSHED BENCHES but no Snowman

Find Zach crossing this dimly lit scene Broken glass on the
cement floor crunching under his sneakers

DWAYNE
(catching up)
Where is she

Zach points to the ice rink

Standing dead center is Hannah slowly scanning the
surroundings She holds the book as if it were a weapon

ON THE ICE

Zach and Dwayne walkslip their way to the center of the ice
joining Hannah who looks around like an owner who lost a pet
ZACH
Hannah
(off her look)
I’m not leaving you

HANNAH

Shes in here
(gentle voice)

Abby Abby

DWAYNE

Abby This isn’t a poodle And
what are ya gonna do with that
book We need a gun

HANNAH
No guns They won’t do anything
anyway

DWAYNE

Then a hatchet Something

HANNAH
Shhh

A tiny pin drop sound calls Zach’s attention to the ice
floor He kneels Finds a small candy Examines it

ZACH
(confused)
It’s an M and M
Another MandM bounces off the ice
Then another
It starts to rain MandM’s followed by a stream of candy bars

They all slowly look up to see

The Snowman hanging from the rafters holding a vending
machine in one arm digging through it with the other

He lets go of the machine and it falls

ZACH
Look out

Zach pushes Hannah and Dwayne out of the way as
SLAM The vending machine crashes into the ice cracking it
They slide to a stop several yards away get to their feet

The Snowman jumps down landing on the machine like a
predator on its fallen prey and

continues digging junk food out of the vending machine
DWAYNE
Well she looks happy Eating her
candy Nice snow-beast
(loud whisper)
Let’s go

HANNAH
We have to get closer

ZACH
Can I just ask - what is the goal
here
HANNAH
Look the book can suck it back in
but we have to get very close
DWAYNE
Wait - we gotta get very close so
the book can suck it back in
Screw that
The Snowman turns and notices them
Her eyes tighten angrily

Beat Then the snowman starts towards them quick long
steps cutting the distance in seconds

DWAYNE
What is she doing

HANNAH
Just wait

ZACH
Hannah what are you doing

HANNAH
Be quiet Almost

The Abominable Snowman is practically on top of her

HANNAH
Now

She opens the book the magic starts but it’s too late
The snowman’s elongated arms swat the book from her hands
-sending it flying across the rink like a hockey puck
Zach Hannah and Dwayne runslide in different directions
The snowman’s temporarily unsure of who to chase after first
Hannah reaches for the book It’s within her grasp

The Snowman goes for Hannah
SY

With only seconds before Hannah is pulverized Zach spies a
pile of HOCKEY STICKS

Grabbing one he slides toward the book and

-Swats the book with a hockey stick-- sending it soaring
back across the ice rink and into Dwayne’s arms

DWAYNE
I don’t know what to do with this

Zach grabs Hannah by the hand yanking her to her feet

ON DWAYNE He drops the book then stumbles slides and
basically falls his way into the PENALTY BOX

Across the rink Zach and Hannah scramble across the ice the
Snowman hot on their heels

DWAYNE
(waving)
In here

Zach glances over his shoulder sees the snowman swinging its
monster arm at them

Zach pulls Hannah down with him and they both do a baseball
slide across the ice and into the

PENALTY BOX
Dwayne shuts the door as the--
--the snowman crashes into the plexiglass and--
SNOWMAN
(pounding the glass)
ARRRRR

They cower in fear as the snowman pounds on the plexiglass
spider cracking it about to burst through when

SHIVERS (0S)
STOP

Shivers has stepped onto the ice He has picked up the book
and is waving his hands at the Snowman catching its
attention calling it towards him

The snowman turns charges at Shivers

Shivers waits just the right amount of time before--

He opens the book

-and like a portable black hole A VACUUM OF HURRICANE-

FORCE WIND violently erupts inside the rink sucking the
Snowman towards it
4U

Shivers struggles to hold the book as the snarling Snowman
desperately buries its claws into the ice furiously fighting
against the vacuum’s increasing pressure

Then the Snowman’s fur transforms into ink then into
letters

Soon only its slashing paw remains as the last of the
Abominable Snow-Woman of Pasadena disappears back into the
literary prison from where she came Goinggoinggone

Shivers slams the book closed Silence resumes

PENALTY BOX

The three teens exhale in relief then look up to see
-Shivers glaring down on them

DWAYNE
(feeble smile)
How was your filet mignon

SHIVERS
(through gritted teeth)
Get - in - the - car

We HEAR POLICE SIRENS in the distance

INT SHIVERS’S CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT

Silence as an angry Shivers drives Hannah in the passenger
seat Zach and Dwayne in the back

ZACH
Mr Shivers I know you’re angry -
but uh I just have one question
What’s going on And what was
that thing And why do you have
all those Goosebumps manuscripts
And what’s with the locks And are
you RL Stine

Shivers spins around annoyed

SHIVERS
You said one question I counted
fifteen

ZACH

(now convinced)
You are RL Stine

No response from Shivers

DWAYNE
(amazed)
No way That’s you That’s him
(erupting excited)
Dude you’re famous Really
REALLY I read ALL your books
The one about Dr Maniac - bro
that gave me nightmares for days
RL Stine Oh hell yea Can I
get a picture for my Instagram
Real quick

Dwayne sticks his Iphone in front of Stine’s face then poses
for a photo The FLASH blinds Stine

who swerves the car violently

STINE
Get that thing out of my face
You’re going to get us all killed

DWAYNE
(still excited)
RL Stine’s pissed That’s RL
Stine

EXT STINE’S HOUSE - LATER

Stine’s car parks haphazardly in the driveway

INT STINES HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The front door BUSTS open and they all briskly walk inside

STINE
Hannah - go upstairs and pack your
things We’re leaving

HANNAH
(crestfallen)
No

STINE
We can’t afford to stay here a
minute longer

HANNAH
But Zach won’t say anything They
won’t tell anyone Tell him Zach

Before Zach can speak
STINE
It’s beyond that now - didn’t you
see that rink Go upstairs

HANNAH
I don’t want to leave

STINE
I know you’ve gotten attached to
this po-dunk town but I promise
there’s a hundred more we can go to
just like it - populated with
shuffling drones - going to their
pep rallies and pie eating
contests I’m sure there’ll even
be a nosy adolescent you can flirt
with from behind the fence Anda
bumbling sidekick with a pituitary
problem

DWAYNE
Come again
STINE
(locks eyes with her)
Hannah you created this situation -
now we both have to face the
consequences I’m sorry

HANNAH
I understand

Hannah nods then slinks up the stairs
Stine then turns to Zach and Dwayne
STINE

Well I think you’ve done enough
damage for one day I hope you’re
pleased with yourself If you’1ll
excuse me I have to go pack up the
pieces of my life now

Stine disappears deeper into another room

Dwayne turns to Zach musters a shrug

DWAYNE
I got Netflix at my house

Zach grimaces contemplating his next move

INT STINE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Stine moves through the rubble and opens the Egyptian
sarcophagus revealing a PACKED SUITCASE He grabs it

Stine then opens the SHRUNKEN HEAD revealing cash credit
cards etc He is clearly prepared for a quick exit

As he turns for the study
-he finds Zach standing in front of him
ZACH

Please - I promise I won’t say
anything - to anyone
Stine tries to move past him but Zach blocks him

ZACH
Look I don’t like this place much
either I’d go back to New York
right now if I could but I have no
choice And the only thing that
makes me want to stay is Hannah
Please don’t take her away

Suddenly Stine slightly softens

STINE
My young friend that’s all very
sweet and sentimental but this is
a very fraught situation here

Stine continues to pack

ZACH
I can help

STINE
You can’t help

ZACH
I can’t unless you tell me what’s
going on

STINE
It’s a long story A long
unbelievable story

ZACH
I have time Try me Please

Zach gives Stine a plaintive look
Stine contemplates for a moment Then

STINE
Once there was a young writer - who
cared nothing for the real world -
found it and the people who inhabit
it - entirely foolish All he
cared about was creating stories -
stories about monsters wreaking
havoc on the tedious town he had
the misfortune of living in He
put everything into his work And
one day - the writer became so
single-minded and his writing so
vivid - the monsters in his stories
literally leapt off the page and
come to life

ZACH
(dumbfounded )
No way
STINE
Way Every monster in every story
waits eagerly to be freed from the
Manuscript that is their home The
writer can control them by keeping
them locked up But if he opens
the book the - beast - lives

ZACH
This writer needs to stop writing

STINE
He has stopped

ZACH

Can’t he just destroy the
manuscripts Wouldn’t that put an
end to it

STINE
This is the writer’s life work
His great pride

(a bit rueful)
And besides they may be monsters
but they are also his only
companions

As Zach struggles to digest this

we REVEAL Dwayne is hovering in the doorway unbeknownst
to them Having overheard everything he blurts out

DWAYNE
That is some messed up shit

Seeing Dwayne Stine hardens again
STINE
(to ZACH)
Now you see - this is above your
grade level
A solemn Hannah enters carrying her suitcase
STINE
Hannah help me with the
manuscripts
Stine pulls open the double doors to the STUDY
He stops cold as we REVEAL
ALL OF THE MANUSCRIPTS ARE GONE
STINE
(thunderstruck)
No No

Zach Hannah and Dwayne all join him in the doorway
too are dumbfounded

Stine frantic now rushes inside

They

The others follow Every shelf and bookcase is the same
empty

STINE
The manuscripts Where are they
HANNAH
(stammering)
I they were just here

Stine looks around the room confused He then sees
--a RED CARNATION on the floor

Stine picks up the carnation and stares at it

Stine’s face expresses his horror

STINE
Not him

Just then OMINOUS LAUGHTER is heard And then a creepy
child-like voice

VOICE (VO)
(imitating)
Not him Not him

All eyes look up as a SHADOW falls upon them Lightning
FLARES across the stained-glass windows and we REVEAL

SLAPPY - all two-foot eight-inches of him Hannibal Lecter
meets Pinocchio Slappy stands on top of the tallest
bookcase holding one of the MANUSCRIPTS and a GOLD KEY

SLAPPY
Slappy’s so happy And free

Stine stares down Slappy as if trying to reason with a
naughty child

STINE
(stern)
Youre not supposed to be out
Slappy You’re supposed to be on
the shelf

SLAPPY
(giggles)
Slappy’s not going anywhere

Slappy’s head turns in a circle mischievously

SLAPPY
Tonight is Slappy’s night

HANNAH
What are you going to do Slappy

SLAPPY
What I was born to do

STINE
And what is that

SLAPPY
You should know You made me
laughs
All your children are coming out to

play

STINE
No Slappy

SLAPPY
We’re gonna rule this town - and
everyone in it

STINE
Where are the books Slappy Give
me back the manuscripts

SLAPPY
Tonight is gonna be the best story
youve ever written Too bad you
won’t be alive to read it But
with you gone we can play forever

Slappy takes out one of the manuscripts

ON BOOK - the binding reads “Revenge of The Lawn Gnomes”
Slappy puts a LIGHTER to the book

STINE
No Slappy

SLAPPY
Bye Poppa I promise we’1ll make
you proud
Slappy tosses the FLAMING BOOK out the open window
Another lightning FLASH Thunder CRASHES
And just like that - Slappy is gone
Stine and the others look at each other
DWAYNE
(scanning the room)
That’s one quick midget
STINE
We have to stop him We have to
get the manuscripts
Stine and the others run toward the front door

Stine tries to open the front door but it won’t budge

STINE (CONTD)
It’s locked from the outside
ZACH
(trying a window)
Locked

Clack Clack Clack Something rushes past them in the dark
Dwayne spins around

DWAYNE
What was that

Clack Clack Clack

ZACH
(points left)
Something over there

DWAYNE
(points right)
Nah man It was over there

Clack Clack Clack
HANNAH
(in dread
You’re both right
Shadows rush across the floor Across shelves Small Fast A
dozen Maybe more Clearly our terrified heroes aren’t alone
in the dark library

Tension mounting Stine slowly and cautiously reaches forward
and pulls

-the pull-string on a nearby desk lamp to reveal

they’re surrounded by a pack of ravenous blood-thirsty
PORCELAIN LAWN GNOMES

Zach notices the other’s horrified expressions He doesn’t
quite get the cause for alarm

ZACH
This is worse than it looks right

With that the lawn gnomes’ eyes turn red as they spring to
life and attack

Small but fast the lawn gnomes move like circus acrobats -
stacking soaring and somersaulting through the air Armed
with GARDEN TOOLS these gnomes mean business

They quickly lasso Dwayne and Stine together with a GARDEN
HOSE sending them to the floor

The Gnomes jump on to the back of Dwayne as he SHRIEKS

DWAYNE
Get ‘em off Get ‘em off

Thinking fast Zach grabs a nearby fireplace poker and
4d

Shatters the attacking lawn gnomes turning them into
dust

Hannah does the same knocking the lawn gnomes off her uncle
Whack Smash

Unfortunately for every lawn gnome that’s shattered two
more appear to take their place

STINE
We have to find a way out All the
doors and windows are locked

HANNAH
The cellar door Follow me

They race down the stairs and rush into the
BASEMENT

ZACH
Watch out for the bear traps

Hannah grabs on to Zach’s hand as they hopscotch across the
floor avoiding the traps

Dwayne tries to follow suit by grabbing on to Stine’s hand
Stine slaps him away as both of them glance behind at the--

-- platoon of lawn gnomes pouring down the stairs

ZACH (CONTD)
(waving)
C’mon

Stine and Dwayne race across the basement floor with the lawn
gnomes hot on their tail

Unaware of the traps the Lawn Gnomes run right into them
The traps go off like popcorn exploding the lawn gnomes into
ceramic pieces

PAN OFF the house to “THE HAUNTED CAR” idling in the street
Through the windshield we see the silhouette of Slappy

sitting in the driver’s seat

Suddenly the car’s headlights turn on

Slappy’s demented head is illuminated by the headlights He
looks down

all of the MANUSCRIPTS are in a pile on the passenger

He laugh maniacally

cellar door slamming it shut behind them just in time to
SEE

Slappy’s Haunted Car TAIL LIGHTS hovering into the distance
Hannah turns to Stine

HANNAH
Not him

ZACH
Why not him

STINE
Of all the monsters Slappy’s the
most intelligent most sadistic
most crafty

DWAYNE
So he’s your favorite

ZACH
What do you think he’1l do

STINE
I know what he’1ll do I wrote the
book He’s going to open all the
manuscripts then burn them Once
their books are destroyed there’s
no way to get the monsters back
inside In minutes this town is
going to be complete mayhem And
it won’t stop there He’1ll turn
this whole world into his own
personal Horrorland

They all take in the gravity of the moment turning their
heads toward the city center

EXT ROAD - DAY

The HAUNTED CAR speeds down the road with evil Slappy behind
the wheel - it swerves wildly sending other CARS careening

off the road

PEDESTRIANS dive out of its way

Instantly we SEE a HERD of angry hideous MAN-EATING PLANT

Slappy GIGGLES as he sets fire to the book and tosses it

The Haunted Car continues on

In front of an APARTMENT COMPLEX the Haunted Car comes to a

bedazzles a cute dress for Melissa

Lorraine crosses the room to her supplies

The sounds of SCRATCHING are heard at the front door

Melissa hears it She takes a few steps to the front door
and opens

ON THE FRONT PORCH

An adorable FRENCH POODLE panting Melissa beams
MELISSA

MOMENTS LATER

Lorraine crosses the room with some plastic gems and stops
cold

Melissa stands with the French poodle in the middle of the
room

Lorraine is STARTLED but quickly grins She bends down
before the white-haired pooch

LORRAINE
You must be lost Are you
hungry little fella

And with that the french poodle’s eyes blaze red as it bears
its vampiric fangs and levitates three feet off the ground

Lorraine SCREAMS hits the evil dog with her handbag then
scoops Melissa in her arms She bolts from the house

The engine starts and they take off blissfully unaware of
what’s going on just under their noses

Just as they pull out the Haunted Car pulls in and comes to
an abrupt halt

Slappy opens a book and A CREW OF BUG-EYED ALIENS appear

SLAPPY

HANNAH
(to STINE)
What are we going to do

STINE
Without those manuscripts there’s
nothing I can do

HANNAH
We have to think - there’s gotta be
an answer

A flash of hope registers on Stine’s face but then he shakes
it off

STINE
(considers then)
No It’s impossible

HANNAH
Wait what What were you
thinking

STINE
Just that well if I wrote them
off the page then maybe there’s a
way I could write them back on it
Do you understand

DWAYNE
I don’t understand anything that’s
happened all night

ZACH

Yes yes that’s it
STINE

But it wouldn’t work
ZACH

Why not
STINE

Do you know how many stories Id
have to write to recapture every
monster I ever created
Zach is stumped But then

HANNAH
Just one
(off their looks)

DS

One story to capture every monster

ZACH
That’s right They do it inc
books all the time “Legion of
Doom””Sinister Six”

STINE
This isn’t a comic book Look

omic

it’s too big a risk And I would

need time - and we have none

HANNAH
We have to try

Stine stands conflicted After an extended moment

STINE
Okay - let’s try it

The others brighten

ZACH
You’11 write it

STINE

Yes but I need my Smith Corona

Zach indicates Stine’s house

ZACH

We can use my laptop It’ll be

faster

STINE
All my stories were written on

own unique process

uneasily

It’s Dwayne’s fault He broke the

private moment together

I’m sorry Uncle You warned me so
many times
He reaches across and puts a consoling hand on her
STINE
(tenderly)
It was bound to happen eventually
I created this - not you It’s not
your responsibility Hannah
She smiles back at him somewhat comforted
Just then from the back

All eyes turn ahead as we reveal TWO PEOPLE standing in the
middle of the street

Stine’s car is heading right for them
Stine hits the brakes as-

Wham The car comes to a sudden halt as its front end slams
into a tree

Just then the “people” walk into the MOONLIGHT revealing
themselves to be transparent GHOSTS

Why is there a tree in the middle
of the road

They all look out the front window and up

Stine’s car didn’t hit a tree at all but instead the
leg of a fifty foot tall

PRAYING MANTIS As the praying mantis lowers its head and
peers in the front windshield-

giant praying mantis

Seeing them the praying mantis HISSES with primal fury

Right Now I remember

Stine feverishly pounds the gas as he throws the car in

up and

frustration

Dwayne nods with confidence

The back exit is right past the

Hannah and Zach walk together Hannah gives him a wry smile

HANNAH
Are we having fun yet

ZACH
Yeah - loads
(teasing her)
If you’d just met me out by the
trash cans the other night none of
this would have happened

I kinda want a Coke Maybe a
Gatorade though Or maybe just a
juice

STINE
For God’s sakes just grab
something
Dwayne grabs a drink and they continue around the corner
Suddenly Stine grabs Dwayne and they all stop
THEY SEE milk all over the floor
We FOLLOW THEIR EYES as further down the aisle they SEE

A PACK OF BROWN-HAIRED WEREWOLVES hungrily lapping up cases
and cartons of milk in the dairy section

Sensing intruders the WEREWOLVES quickly spin around to see-

Nothing Zach Stine and the others are nowhere to be found

Senses reeling the snarling werewolves bare their teeth and
slowly move out to investigate

FROZEN FOOD AISLE - MOMENTS LATER

The three werewolves scan the deserted scene As they do we
PULL BACK to reveal

that Zach and Hannah are pressed up against a display rack
at the end of the aisle

Nearby Stine remains crouched down behind the ISLAND FREEZER
that runs down the center of the frozen food aisle

Dwayne lies still inside the island freezer just below the
werewolves line of sight

Ears perked the blood-thirsty werewolves slowly make their
way down the frozen food aisle nostrils flailing paws
pounding

Wedged between the frozen fish sticks and tater tots Dwayne
cautiously peers out to see the werewolves’ passing
reflection in the glass doors of the adjacent freezers
Dwayne quickly lies back down and remains still

The first two werewolves move past Dwayne without so much as
a glance Then

The third werewolf stops Sniffs the air

Zach and Hannah watch on helplessly Stine tightens

Dwayne closes his eyes Doesn’t dare move
o
The werewolf moves on
Zach and the others offers a silent sigh of relief when-

Dwayne’s teeth suddenly begin to chatter from the cold
Dwayne quickly holds his mouth closed but--

The damage is done The werewolves stop

Zach and Hannah watch in horror as the werewolves slowly
turn shifting their gazes toward the island freezer when-

Thinking fast Zach grabs a nearby a SLAB OF BEEF from the
refrigerator and

-hurls it across the store

Smelling the beef the distracted werewolves take off back
the way they came racing toward the other side of the store

Once the coast is clear Zach Hannah and Stine rush out of
hiding and pull the chilled Dwayne out of the freezer

STINE
Go Go Go Go

With Stine leading the way the four rush

-out of the frozen food aisle past the deli counter and
towards the emergency exit when

TWO MORE WEREWOLVES spring up from behind the DELI
COUNTER

Zach and the others SCREAM as the gray-haired werewolves fix
their ravenous gazes on the “fresh meat” that stands before

them
The werewolves pounce as the four race into the

STORAGE ROOM

Zach and the others charge toward the distant EMERGENCY EXIT
as the two werewolves pursue

As Zach and the others cut left past a pile of pallets Zach
strategically knocks over a nearby MOP BUCKET sending the
pursuing werewolves

Sliding across the soapy floor

As the furious werewolves regain their footing our four
heroes rush out the EMERGENCY EXIT and into

EXT - ALLEY WAY
Zach SLAMS the steel door shut behind them

ZACH
That oughta hold them
oZ

But just then the fire door EXPLODES OUTWARD as the
ravenous werewolves continue to chase down their prey

SCREAMING as they run Zach and the others race down the
narrow alley way - a brick wall on one side a chain link
fence on the other

Navigating their way past GARBAGE CANS and PILES OF STACKED
NEWSPAPERS the four round the corner and stop dead before a
LOCKED GATE

As Zach pulls and pulls on the gate-

The sound of SNARLS is heard coming closer and closer

Zach and the others turn to see

Two werewolves slowly closing in

Stine moves protectively in front of Hannah as the werewolves
prepare to pounce when-

HEADLIGHTS flood the scene Zach and the others turn as-

CRASH A MINI-VAN BLASTS THROUGH THE CHAIN-LINKED FENCE
crashing into the two werewolves like a six-cylinder
battering ram A bumper sticker reads I BRAKE FOR MACRAME

Once the dust garbage and newspapers settle the DRIVER
steps out of the mini-van and into the light as we reveal--

Lorraine Glasses cracked Hair a mess Poodle fur all over
her dress She looks absolutely fried

LORRAINE
(whimpers )
Someone’s been breeding killer
poodles or something

Melissa sits in the back of the mini-van safely buckled in

A relieved Zach unbuckles his sister and holds her tightly in
his arms

ZACH
Am I glad to see you

Smoke pours out of the mini-van’s cracked engine as noise is
heard in the distance

More monsters alerted to the commotion

STINE
We have to keep moving

Lorraine looks Stine over and gives him a friendly smile
patting down her hair

LORRAINE

As the others run Zach pulls Lorraine Leaving the
smoldering mini-van behind they race into the night

You were right about one thing
Living here is a lot more exciting
than I thought it’d be

They walk for a moment in silence then Hannah stops

HANNAH

Listen Zach I know this is a
weird time - because you know
monsters are everywhere and the
town is in chaos and we’re running
for our lives but

o4
She locks eyes with him then shakes her head

HANNAH
Never mind Forget it

ZACH
No tell me

HANNAH
No this is NOT the right time
(goes for it)
-to talk about feelings I may or
may not be having for you

Hannah is clearly self-conscious Zach nods

ZACH
You’re right It’s not the right
time And it’s definitely not the
right time for me to talk about the
fact that I may or may not be
having the same feelings for you

A small hopeful smile breaks on Hannah’s face

HANNAH
Really

ZACH
Totally

Zach tries to work up the nerve to kiss her

ZACH
Would it be okay if I uh
Would it be weird if I

Hannah knows what he’s asking She just smiles

HANNAH
It would be the least weird thing
that’s happened all night

And with that Hannah closes her eyes Just as Zach moves in
to kiss her

the moon peeks out from the behind the clouds and we
reveal that Hannah is completely transparent in the
moonlight just like all of Stine’s ghosts

Startled Zach jumps back Hannah opens her eyes to see
Zach looking at her completely freaked out

looking at me like that

Slappy grins at them

Stevens sees the reflection of the aliens in the glass door
He spins around

and SCREAMS when he sees the alien

Instantly an ALIEN shoots him with its FREEZE RAY GUN He
is frozen stiff

Brooks looks on in horror then SCREAMS

As he surrounded by the approaching aliens he FIRES his gun
BANG BANG BANG

But to no avail He is SHOT - frozen in place

The ALIENS shatter the front door of the police station
Just as Slappy is about to triumphantly enter

One of the LAWN GNOMES from Stine’s house appears It is
chipped all over - its little pointy hat broken off

Slappy’s bravado fades when he sees the gnome

I may have never seen the appeal of

wish for this

ZACH
Hannah doesn’t know does she

Stine quickly turns to look at a devastated Zach

STINE
Know what

ZACH
That she’s one of your monsters

Stine locks eyes with Zach

STINE
Hannah is no “monster” - she’s an
angel

ZACH

(angry)
Well she thinks she’s a person - -
a walking talking human being -
not a figment of your imagination
How could you lie to her

STINE
I was trying to protect her

ZACH
Give me a break

STINE
I love Hannah I keep my monsters
locked up but I’ve let Hannah run
free

ZACH
She’s a prisoner in your house

STINE
But her mind is her own Hannah is
kind and wise and my greatest
creation The only beautiful thing
I’ve ever made I didn’t tell her
because I wanted her to be real
She is real - to me

Zach looks at him pained

ZACH
She was real to me too

If you care about her you can’t
let her go on believing she’s
something she’s not You have to
tell her the truth

As Dwayne takes a bathroom break

Lorraine sits with Melissa - who suddenly begins to cry

LORRAINE
What’s wrong sweetie

Melissa points to a nearby SCARECROW standing in the field

LORRAINE
Oh that’s just a scarecrow

Lorraine moves to the scarecrow and shakes it

LORRAINE
See Nothing to be afraid of See

Just then the “harmless-looking” scarecrow comes to life
baring its jagged wooden teeth and lunging towards Lorraine

BACK AT CLEARING
HANNAH
(more insistent)
Tell me about what

But before Zach or Stine can answer Lorraine’s SCREAMS fill
the air

Alarmed the three take off in the direction of the others
As they race around the barn we reveal-

Dwayne struggling to pull the snapping scarecrow off of the
shrieking Lorraine

DWAYNE
This thing’s alive

Spying a nearby SCYTHE Zach shouts

ZACH
Aunt Lorraine - duck

Zach swaps the scarecrow’s head off

As the scarecrow’s snarling head goes rolling into the
cornfield Dwayne hurls the scarecrow’s flailing body to the
side like it was a straw zombie

Suddenly Two more SCARECROWS appear out of the cornfield
Then four Six Ten

Zach and the others soon find themselves surrounded As the
burlap-skinned scarecrows turn their stitched gazes toward

Slappy smiles with devious pleasure

SLAPPY
I see you

We PUSH IN on Slappy’s menacing sneer
INT POLICE STATION —- MOMENTS LATER

We SEE through the window the HAUNTED CAR SCREECHING out of
the parking lot of the police station

Then we PAN BACK TO CCTV MONITOR where

Stine and the kids continue to dig up the time capsule burial
plot

EXT FIELD - CONTINUOUS

The monitor’s image fades to the real scene on the field

Dirt flies everywhere Stine is now waist deep in the
ground Zach turns to Garrison

ZACH
How deep did you bury this thing

Just then a CLANK as Stine’s shovel hits something metal

Stine drops his shovel and using his hands clears the dirt
around

a Stainless steel CONTAINER that reads DO NOT OPEN UNTIL
2045 THE TIME CAPSULE

Stine grabs the shovel again and breaks open the time
capsule’s lock with a forceful BANG

He opens the time capsule and quickly rifles through the
items - a stuffed Pomeranian dog various yearbooks GAME OF
THRONES DVD

He tosses it all to the others Dwayne is soon holding a
Taylor Swift CD

DWAYNE
This is what we’re saving for
future generations

Finally Stine finds what he’s been looking for

Stine’s old SMITH CORONA Stine lifts the typewriter like a
long lost child

ZACH
We need to find a place where you
can write

INT - THEATER - MOMENTS LATER

The set of the current play looks like a 19th Century English
writer’s office Stine sits on the stage at the desk

Zach Dwayne and Hannah gather around him
15-6

Stine rolls up his sleeves cracks his knuckles and prepares
to type He contemplates

STINE
It was a sleepy town It was a
typical town It was a dull as
dirt town

ZACH
Come on “Monsters lose Good
guys win The end”

STINE
The only way to capture a
Goosebumps monster is with a
Goosebumps story I can’t just
phone it in It needs to be
authentic

DWAYNE
Well by the time you figure out
how to describe the town - it’s not
gonna be here

HANNAH
“It was a wonderful town”

STINE
Rings false

HANNAH
Uncle please

Stine concentrates his mind

STINE
I have it

ON PAPER - he types “It was a town worth saving

With Stine actually writing a glimmer of hope passes though
the group They exchange hopeful smiles

ZACH
We gotta go back to the gym to
check on the others
Zach Dwayne and Hannah head for the exit
ZACH
(to STINE)
Good luck
Stine throws a quick tense smile then returns to his
typing
INT SCHOOL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Zach and Hannah hurry back to the gym
HANNAH
You know if you don’t like me you
can just say so

ZACH
What I do like you

HANNAH
Then why are you acting so weird
with me

ZACH
I’m not acting weird

HANNAH
Yes you are I tell you I have
feelings for you and all of a
sudden you won’t even look at me

Zach stops and turns to her

ZACH
Hannah there’s something you need
to know but I just I don’t know
how to say it

Hannah’s face falls as she comes to the wrong conclusion

HANNAH
You don’t have to It’s obvious
Youre not into me It’s okay
Zach I’11 survive I’m not gonna
jump off a bridge or anything

Hannah heads off to the gym leaving Zach in the hall

ZACH
No that’s not Wait Hannah

INT - GYMNASIUM

Zach arrives in the gym to find

The music is off and fear has spread like wildfire

Principal Garrison is at the podium Gale stands beside him

kind destroying the town

Pandemonium in the gym as the STUDENTS REACT

PRINCIPAL GARRISON
(into mic)
Please try to remain calm
Everyone please I’m sure the
police will be here soon
Zach watches the crowd become increasingly unhinged
Garrison is doing a terrible job trying to control the
situation

Zach crosses to the stage
Standing on the podium taking the mic from Garrison
He addresses the crowd
ZACH

I’ve been out there - and I know

what’s going on And at this

point anyone who could help us

can’t even help themselves The

police are not coming

More fearful SHOUTING from the crowd

GALE
Zach
ZACH
(cupping mic to GALE)
Trust me

(addresses crowd)
There will be monsters here - it’s
just a matter of time We need to
barricade this gym so they can’t
get in And arm ourselves with
whatever weapons we can find If
we all work together well be all
right But let’s get going

MOMENTS LATER - AT THE PODIUM

Zach gives orders to a GROUP OF TEACHERS including Coach
Carr Principal Garrison Mr Campbell and Gale

ZACH
(to WOOD SHOP TEACHER)
Mr Cross you gotta have some
extra plywood lying around

MR CROSS
Enough to build an ark

GALE
And there’s bicycle chains in the
lost and found We could use them
to secure the fire exits

ZACH
Great Mom
(to MR CAMPBELL)
Those cannisters in the chem lab
are marked hazardous for a reason
I think it’s time we found out why
COACH CARR
I got rackets bats medicine balls
- enough makeshift weapons for an
army

JANITOR
We’ve got a lot we can use in the

ZACH

Awesome One last thing - is

Mr Campbell raises his hand

MR CAMPBELL

With that the TEACHERS spring into action
Zach turns his attention to Principal Garrison
ZACH

PRINCIPAL GARRISON
Yes yes Okay I’m on it

Principal Garrison heads into the crowd

Zach is left on the podium with Gale She is staring at him

The Haunted Car speeds up and parks in front of the

The door opens and Slappy emerges He has all the remaining
Goosebumps manuscripts

He has a crazed determined grin on his face

SLAPPY
No getting away this time Stine

The manuscripts locks have all been broken - and he tosses
them all into the road in front of him

ON BOOKS - they are all open pages fluttering in the breeze

We HEAR the SOUNDS of MONSTERS materializing all around us -
HISSES and THUMPS and POUNDS and SNARLS

Snappy tosses a MATCH onto the stack of books and they ERUPT
into flames

Slappy’s face is illuminated by the bonfire

Zach and Dwayne are where we left them Suddenly Zach HEARS
the commotion coming from the field

ZACH
Do you hear that

DWAYNE
(nods)
Yeah What is it

Zach and Dwayne cross to the makeshift blockade at the
gymnasium entrance

They peer past the wooden planks that bar the front door to
see

THE ARMY OF GOOSEBUMPS MONSTERS charging out of the mist and
towards the school like a supernatural tidal wave That’s
right--all of ‘em We’ve never seen this many monsters in one

place before and it is truly a sight to behold They are
heading directly for the gym

Dwayne and Zach are dumbfounded

DWAYNE

hallucinating

Zach gives a battle cry to the others
ZACH
This is it people Let’s do

And with that the battle for Normal High begins

Suddenly the blockade behind them EXPLODES as the MONSTERS
attempt to make their way inside the gym

Monsters power their way into the gym just to be met by an

A BLAST OF PRESSURIZED WATER fires at them

Holding the fire hose is none other than Gale She yells
to the Students around her

GALE
Get back to the gym

Gale soon finds herself alone and the fire hose is just too
much for her
Gl

As the spray of water whips wildly in every direction the
graveyard ghouls continue to advance when-

A NEW PAIR OF HANDS grabs the hose

together to

-knock the graveyard ghouls off their feet and out of the

Allison and Davidson SCREAM
Just before the Bug-Eyed Alien opens fire-

Boom The Bug-Eyed Alien explodes into pieces as Dwayne
appears on the scene

Dwayne proudly holds a firework-firing rocket launcher

DWAYNE
Hurry This hallway’s not safe

Davidson and Allison rise and the three take a few steps
toward the gym

They stops dead when they see

A HERD of WEREWOLVES blocking their path just a few yards
away

DWAYNE
Not them again Dang

Davidson simply bolts down the hall in the opposite
direction

Allison realizes she’s been ditched left alone with Dwayne

The Werewolves quickly move in for the kill

Dwayne thinking fast grabs Allison and pulls her into a
classroom

Slappy watches with pleasure on the field as
The MONSTERS continue to battle their way into the gym

Bye bye Poppa

SLAPPY’S POV

Something in his field of vision causes Slappy to turn hi
binoculars in the direction of the THEATER just adjacent to

the gym

ON SLAPPY - his smile begins to fade He takes out a pair of
small binoculars to get a better view

SLAPPY’S POV - THROUGH BINOCULARS

There is a light on in the theater Stine is barely visible
sitting on the stage typing his story

A look of fierce determination on Slappy’s face

(tries to make small talk)
So how’s it going

ALLISON
Not that great

DWAYNE
(just noticing
Where’d your boyfriend go

ALLISON
He’s not my boyfriend anymore
G5

Suddenly the biggest werewolf - the Werewolf of Fever Swamp
enters the classroom

Seeing them it HOWLS and SNARLS moving toward them
They are cornered - without weaponry

DWAYNE
There there Nice uh werewolf

The Werewolf moves toward Allison threateningly
ALLISON
(whimpering)
No No no no
It gnashes its teeth at her It’s ready to bite

Just as the werewolf leaps at her

Dwayne jumps on the back of the raging lycanthrope and buries
his teeth into the werewolf’s hide

To Dwayne’s surprise the werewolf HOWLS in pain as
-his flesh SMOKES and SIZZLES from Dwayne’s bite

Hurling Dwayne aside the wounded werewolf leaps out the
nearest window and into the night

Spitting hair out of his mouth Allison rushes to Dwayne’s
side

ALLISON
Are you okay

Dwayne nods and catches his breath amazed at his own
bravery He pats down his body relieved

DWAYNE
I’m still all here Both legs
Both arms
(feels his head)
Head

Allison notices that Dwayne’s arm has been badly cut by the
werewolf

ALISON
You’re hurt

DWAYNE
It’s nothing Just a scratch

Dwayne rips a pennant from the wall and bandages his wound

ALLISON
How did you do that

Dwayne opens his mouth
G4

DWAYNE
Silver fillings

Just then Zach and Hannah rush into the classroom

ZACH
Come on We gotta get to Stine -

Dwayne nods - and rises to his feet

INT THEATER - CONTINUOUS

Stine alone in the theater has been typing feverishly - a
substantial number of finished pages next to his typewriter

STINE

(talks as he types)
“All the monsters had converged -
The Beasts from the East the
vicious vampire bats the gargoyles
and the Bug-Eyed Aliens the
vicious gnomes and the praying
mantis”

We HEAR a VOICE in the dark auditorium

SLAPPY (0S)
Forgetting somebody

Stine looks up He can’t see him but he can recognize that
creepy voice anywhere

STINE
Slappy

Giggles echo through the big auditorium
Stine finally spots Slappy in a front row seat

STINE
How did you find me

SLAPPY

I know you Stine I created you
Or is it the other way around I
always forget

(giggles)
Youre missing all the fun All
your children have come out to

STINE
(plaintive)
No Slappy All of this must end

SLAPPY
You don’t care about this town

(annoyed)
But why should they I’11 give you
a choice Stine Work with us and

Slappy giggles

The LIGHTS flash off When they return Slappy has
disappeared

STINE
Slappy Slappy

We HEAR giggling Stine scans the room

SLAPPY (0S)
Hi

Stine startles Slappy is standing on the desk just inches
from Stine Slappy looks down at the pages

SLAPPY
What’s this

STINE
Just working on a little something

SLAPPY
(locks eyes with him)
Don’t get too creative Stine
Youll regret it
STINE
No you‘ll like this story It’s
the best one I’ve ever written
SLAPPY
angr
NO MORE STORIES
Slappy reaches for the pages of the new story
Stine quickly snatches them up and away

Slappy GRIMACES - and he is just about to leap on Stine
when

Zach Hannah Dwayne and Allison enter from the wings

HANNAH
Uncle

Stine turns his attention to the kids then looks back

Slappy has disappeared
vo
Stine is momentarily stunned

STINE
Slappy - where’d he go

ZACH
Did you finish

STINE
A few more pages and I’m done

ZACH
You can’t do it here The monsters
are everywhere Come with us

Stine grabs his pages and typewriter still spooked by
Slappy’s appearance

INT GYMNASIUM - LATER

With nowhere left to hide everyone has taken shelter in the
gym The SCHOOL NURSE is there to aid the wounded - it’s
like an improvised MASH unit Gale is here with Melissa and
Lorraine

Stine Zach Hannah and Dwayne breathlessly enter Principal
Garrison intercepts them

PRINCIPAL GARRISON
We’re surrounded on all sides

Glass shatters The walls quake as plaster falls

DWAYNE
So now what do we do The monsters
are gonna be all over us in seconds
and Stine still has to write the
ending of the story

Zach considers their dilemma long and hard then-

ZACH
The school buses How many buses
are here

PRINCIPAL GARRISON
Uh three I think

ZACH
Well put everyone we can fit onto
one bus then we’ll send the other
two off in opposite directions If
the monsters take the bait we’ll
have a one in three chance of
getting out of here alive

DWAYNE
I don’t like those odds

ZACH
If we stay here our odds are zero
DWAYNE
Let’s go In the buses people

STINE
(stops them)
No no that won’t work Monsters
can smell fear No matter how many
decoy buses we use they’1l still
be able to sniff us out

Frustrated Zach slams his hands against the refreshment
table As his eyes fall upon the stacks of soda-

ZACH
I think I have a really bad idea
INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Teens and teachers race down the abandoned hallways fending
off monsters as they go Zach hurriedly ushers them along

ZACH
C’mon Go Go Go

Smash A TENTACLE blasts in through the window in front of
Zach and Hannah

Zach knocks Hannah out of the way as dust glass and rubble
shower the scene The tentacle retracts

HANNAH
Thanks

They share a quick smile and then
ZACH
Listen I didn’t kiss you before
because I was scared But I swear
to God - there’s nothing I want to
do more

HANNAH
Then do it

Zach grabs Hannah and kisses her full on the lips

Hannah kisses him back And for that one brief moment it’s
like there’s no one in the school but them

Another TENTACLE BLASTS through the window
Dwayne grabs them both and pulls them along with him

DWAYNE
We don’t have time for that

With the halls in chaos behind them they all rush for the

The other MONSTERS too smell fear and chase the first bus
Wham The Haunted Car races beside the first bus and
BARRELS into its side

It knocks the school bus out of the street and into the
neighboring cornfield

Losing control on the ragged terrain the school bus FLIPS
over on its side and comes to a stop

Stampeding monsters arrive on the scene and invade the over-
turned bus

As an orgy of all our hideous monsters - the gargoyles the
gnomes the praying mantis the bats the wolves the aliens -
they all descend upon the bus
YUe

We SOON SEE what they SEE

INT FIRST BUS - CONTINUOUS
The bus is empty

A hockey stick holds down the gas pedal while a leather belt
binds the wheel in place

Hundreds of empty cans of ENERGY DRINK lie spilled
everywhere giving off the scent of epinephrine---the
chemical component of fear A label on the can emphasizes
this

We SEE an EXPLOSIVE DEVICE has also been rigged

In the back of the second bus Dwayne and Allison hover over

Dwayne presses the detonator

there is a SUDDEN POWERFUL BOOM

THE SCHOOL BUS GOES UP IN A HUGE FIREBALL

The explosion is massive and deafening

EXT ANOTHER PART OF HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
Slappy standing beside the Haunted Car watches stunned

Slappy’s hair is singed and a can of energy drink is blown
out of the sky and lands on his head

Slappy picks up the can - and realizes he’s been had He
crumples the can outraged

EXT ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Filled with teachers and students the third bus driven by
Principal Garrison races in the opposite direction away

from the school

INSIDE THE THIRD BUS
Yl

Seeing the bomb cloud and realizing they are out of harm’s
way everyone CHEERS

We FIND a petrified Davidson sitting near the back
hyperventilating He turns to the GEEK sitting next to him

DAVIDSON
Please tell me it’s over

Davidson literally PISSES HIMSELF The Geek is disgusted
Near the front a troubled Gale looks out the window

as the second school bus with Zach and our heroes on it
disappears into the distance

INT THIRD SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS
Stine types in the back
STINE (VO)
“Having taken the bait the

Up in the front Zach drives while Hannah stands behind him

ZACH

He and Hannah HIGH-FIVE
BACK IN THE BUS

We FIND Dwayne sitting next to Allison Celebrating she
gives him a big hug

ALLISON
You did it You killed them

Dwayne can’t believe his luck

DWAYNE
I guess I did

Stine looks up from his typewriter

STINE
They’re not dead Nothing can get
rid of the monsters except putting
them back into a book This just
bought us some time They’1ll be
coming for us soon enough

The others look back their hopes crushed

We CAN SEE the injured GOOSEBUMPS MONSTERS some of them
recovering some of them already beginning to give chase
yl
DWAYNE
Turn left We’1ll take the Bridge
right out of town and onto the main
highway
As Zach turns to do just that-

HANNAH
Look out

jarring halt

The bridge has been completely destroyed The bus hangs
perilously close to the edge Slappy has done everything in
his power to keep Stine from escaping town

Zach and the others take in the destroyed bridge

HANNAH
So much for leaving town and
getting help

ZACH
We have to get Stine somewhere he
can finish his story Somewhere
with lots of places to hide - and
where there’s absolutely no people

Light bulb They both turn to each other with the same idea

Zach pulls on the steering wheel making a sharp turn

EXT ABANDONED AMUSEMENT PARK - MOMENTS LATER
The bus pulls up and parks with a sudden HALT
Zach Hannah Dwayne Allison and Stine all pile out

HANNAH
Uncle you think Slappy will find

STINE
(approving)
Slappy knows me as well as I know
him But this is probably the last
place he’d think I’d think he’d
think I’d go

DWAYNE

They take off towards the park running

EXT AMUSEMENT PARK ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dwayne forcibly shoves Stine down in the stroller

EXT AMUSEMENT PARK —- MOMENTS LATER

Being pushed on a kiddie stroller by Zach Stine types as
he’s rolled along

STINE
(typing)
“It was clear that there was only
one place in the park left to hide
The arcade gallery”
The kids stop and look around for the arcade gallery

HANNAH
There is no arcade gallery

Stine looks around himself There is a FUN HOUSE nearby He
quickly goes back to typing

STINE
I mean “The fun house”
INT - FUN HOUSE
MECHANICAL GHOULS sneer as the fun house’s doors burst open
Stine is wheeled inside still typing as he goes

Zach and the others frantically bar the fun house doors with
anything they can find

STINE
(typing)
“But before Slappy and the monsters
could find them the story was
finally completed”

As Stine types the others are frightened by the weird
monsters depicted inside the fun house

One of them seems to SPRING TO LIFE jumping out at Allison

Allison SHRIEKS holding onto Dwayne tight
Y4

ALISON
(panicking)
Oh my god Hold me Dwayne

Dwayne can’t believe his luck
Even Zach and Hannah are startled when
A MECHANICAL GHOUL seems to leap out in their direction

Stine shouts as he types - perhaps to ward off “evil
spirits”

STINE
“And Slappy and all the rest of the
monsters disappeared back into the
world of paper and ink NEVER TO
BE SEEN AGAIN THE END”

As Stine pulls the final page out of the typewriter-

ZACH
So that’s it It’s done

STINE
Hand me the cover

Zach grabs the manuscript cover from Stine’s satchel

Before he can assemble the manuscript inside its cover we
HEAR

SLAPPY (0S)
Slappy’s not happy

Everyone stops frozen for a moment They see
SLAPPY standing in front of a HUGE FUN-HOUSE MIRROR

SLAPPY
Trying to hide from Slappy Stine
That’s like hiding from yourself

HANNAH
Eat rocks Slappy

SLAPPY
(to HANNAH)
Shut up you
(turns to STINE)
Remember when it was just you and
me Stine I was your first story -
and your best

STINE
That’s the problem Slappy I was
living just with my fantasies - and
that’s when it all went wrong I
need people Real living people
yo
SLAPPY

We could be together forever I’11

be your muse

STINE
Never

Slappy grimaces - angry he’s been rejected

SLAPPY
I’m gonna miss you Poppa

With that Slappy withdraws a SINGLE MANUSCRIPT from under
his coat The one book that even he didn’t dare open

Its familiar title--The Blob That Ate Everyone”

SLAPPY

I didn’t want to have to do this
STINE

No no Not him Slappy
SLAPPY

You have no one to blame but

yourself

Stine frantically tries to finish assembling his manuscript
while

Slappy with Stine’s key unlocks the book

And BOOM A hurricane BLAST of PINK SLIME reveals

--the two hundred foot-tall gelatinous mass - the BLOB
Stine’s largest and most deadly monster A sight as awesome

as it is horrifying

ALLISON
It’s hideous

DWAYNE
It’s so fat and pink

Suddenly the rotted wood of the fun house implodes like
cardboard as the Blob’s gelatinous pink slime bursts through

Zach Hannah Dwayne and Allison back away from the walls

Wham The fun house walls EXPLODE as the massive Blob Who Ate
Everything shatters their hiding place

The blast sends the group into the air and flying backwards

EXT AMUSEMENT PARK - NEAR FERRIS WHEEL -— CONTINUOUS

Zach and the others rise and dust themselves off They are
now standing in the middle of the park the Blob still
threatening to engulf them
yo

ZACH
This way

They all spin around and begin to run in the opposite
direction of the Blob when they are faced with

Slappy sporting a fiendish grin

DWAYNE
This is not good

Just then Zach realizes
the pages of Stine’s story are fluttering into the wind

ZACH
The story The story

The kids frantically try to grab the swirling airborne
pages

SLAPPY
(emphatic)
No No more stories Real life is
soooo much better

Slappy giggles We NOW SEE that the entire army of
GOOSEBUMPS MONSTERS have found their way to the amusement
park

There is nowhere to run The BLOB is behind them quickly
spreading their way And Slappy and all the other ravenous
monsters stand before them ready to devour

Stine just stares at Slappy

STINE
He’s right No more stories

The kids stop chasing the pages and turn to look at Stine

STINE
I’ve run away from life my whole
life By turning away from the
real world - I gave birth to them

He points to Slappy and the Blob

STINE
This is my fault I made this
And if anyone should suffer for it
it’s me Not this town Not these
kids You want blood Slappy
Take mine

HANNAH
No

Stine walks over and presents himself to Slappy as the BLOB
creeps closer
SLAPPY
Aww isn’t that sweet But Slappy
could never hurt you

But it’s Stine who pounces on Slappy grabbing him
forcefully then turns to the kids

STINE
Get the pages Hurry

Slappy fights back jumping on Stine gnashing his sharp
wooden teeth

Zach and the others spring into action grabbing up all the
pages of the story and the leather cover

Much struggling between Stine and Slappy They are ina
fierce battle of wills

As they tussle Stine and Slappy fall to the ground right
beside The Blob

And just like that

The Blob That Ate Everyone swallows Stine and Slappy whole
BELCH

Zach and the others turn and look

HANNAH
Uncle

All that’s left of Stine is his fallen satchel
Hannah rushes toward the Blob but Zach holds her back

ZACH
Wait He’s still alive

Zach notices the human form struggling within the Blob’s
translucent innards Stine

An AIR BUBBLE surrounds Stine’s head like an oxygen helmet

ZACH
Give me the pages

The others hand over their pages and Zach assembles it into
the manuscript

The Blob and the other MONSTERS continues to encroach on
them

Zach places the pages between the manuscript’s leather cover
and closes the book

The Blob seems to now have Allison too
She falls her legs covered in pink slime

Hannah manages to help her up and out of harm’s way
Joe

ON ZACH AND DWAYNE

With the book now complete all Zach has to do is open
itand the monsters will be sucked inside

Zach suddenly freezes his face filled with dread

DWAYNE
It’s ready to go Come on What
are you waiting for Open the book

ZACH
I can’t

DWAYNE
What are you talking about

ZACH
Stine wrote that “all of his
monsters” will be trapped All
of his monsters

DWAYNE
So what

ZACH
(under his breath)
Hannah’s one of Stine’s monsters

Dwayne looks over at Hannah leading Allison away from the
Blob

DWAYNE
That’s a fine lookin’ monster

ZACH
If they go she goes I don’t
think Stine realized
DWAYNE
You’ve gotta do this Or else we
ALL die
But a conflicted Zach refuses to act

DWAYNE
If you don’t do it I will

As Dwayne advances Zach holds him off The two struggle as
the book falls to the ground

Just then - a NEW SET OF HANDS picks up the book
Zach and Dwayne look up to SEE
Hannah preparing to open the book

ZACH
Hannah wait Don’t
YY

HANNAH
Why not

ZACH
If you do

Hannah finds the words that Zach can’t

HANNAH
I’1l wind up back on a bookshelf
with the rest of my uncle’s
monsters

ZACH
(shocked)
You knew

HANNAH
I’ve had my suspicions How many
fourteenth birthdays can one girl
have

ZACH
Hannah you don’t understand If
you open that book

Hannah gives him a sweet sad smile

HANNAH
I know what will happen Zach
(off his look)

Don’t be sad for me I got to see
this beautiful world And meet
ou And I’1l always live in your
imagination Which is where I
belong

The Blob has them now totally cornered them against the wall
They have no escape and will soon be ingested

DWAYNE
Come on We don’t got all night

Hannah raises the book toward the Blob then looks back at
Zach

HANNAH
I’m just sorry we never got to go
on that second date

ZACH
Hannah don’t--

But before Zach can finish--

Hannah opens the book

And with that a VACUUM OF HURRICANE-FORCE WIND IS RELEASED
upon the scene

--pulling all the Goosebumps monsters out of our world and
back into their own
LUU
Whoosh Whoosh Whoosh
One after the other all the monsters are sucked back into a
world of paper and ink Scarecrows werewolves gargoyles
gnomes the Abominable Snowman of Pasadena
Unable to maintain her grip on the vacuum the book is swept
out of Hannah’s hands landing on the ground in the center of
the midway
A TORNADO OF GHOULS AND GOBLINS swirl through the air as
monsters are forcefully yanked off their feet and down into
the opened book
As the humongous blob is sucked into the book

Stine tumbles out of the Blob’s innards and onto the
ground gasping for air

Slappy still has a stranglehold on his neck

SLAPPY
Slappy’s REALLY not happy

Then Stine using all his might grabs the typewriter off
the ground and

clobbers Slappy with it

STINE
Stupid dummy

Slappy SCREAMS then loses his grip on Stine
He is sent tumbling into the vortex

As Slappy is sucked away his wooden fingers dig frantically
into the ground

SLAPPY
I’1l be back

And with that Slappy disappears into the swirling void
On Hannah - she prepares herself to join the others when

Zach grabs her and holds on desperately yelling over the
paranormal HOWLS

ZACH
Maybe if I hold you tight
enough

But it’s pointless and they both know it Hannah offers Zach
a consoling smile

HANNAH
Zach do you want to save the
girl
(off ZACH’s nod)
Then let go
Lule
But Zach just can’t do it

Smiling Hannah leans forward and kisses Zach gently on the
cheek

And with that Zach slowly and reluctantly lets Hannah go
And then-

Whoosh Hannah along with the last of Stine’s monsters
disappears right before Zach’s eyes

Dwayne quickly rushes forward slams the book closed and
locks it trapping all the monsters within

And just like that the wind dies down as silence resumes

Zach stands alone Dwayne approaches and puts a comforting
hand on Zach’s shoulder

DWAYNE
We had to man

Zach nods elsewhere
Stine composes himself looking over the scene with relief
STINE
(to himself)
It worked It worked

Stine rises and crosses to Zach

STINE
Where’s Hannah

Stine follows Zach’s solemn gaze to the book

STINE
No

As Stine grabs the book from Dwayne’s hands-

Zach grabs the book’s other end as he and Stine lock eyes
Zach’s expression says it all What’s done can’t be undone

They stand in solemn silence and we

DISSOLVE TO

They high five and Dwayne takes off

Zach smiles to himself as he crosses the street

cold when he sees

IN THE PARKING LOT

Stine wearing more conventional clothing talking to his

Aunt Lorraine
Stine sees Zach and waves him over
Zach crosses to them

LORRAINE
Hey sweetie It’s a beautiful
day Look at the new bag I made -

ZACH
It’s colorful

LORRAINE
Okay I gotta go to my Board
meeting See you both later

Lorraine leans in and gives Stine a kiss Stine returns

Zach watches stunned

LORRAINE

Lorraine walks off leaving Zach and Stine alone

ZACH

What was that
STINE

ZACH

Hanging out
STINE

ZACH

STINE
Come on Get in the car I want
to take you somewhere

Zach finds this curious but dutifully moves to the car

EXT FERRY — DAY

waters

Stine and Zach are on a commuter ferry sailing across calm

In Stine’s hands is the manuscript for “The Long Halloween”
bound together with chains padlocks and several more diary-
style book locks

Plunk The chained and weighted book hits the water and
disappears into the murky depths below Stine tosses his
stress ball in behind it

Zach and Stine watch the book fade from sight--bonded in
their loss

They exchange grins

STINE
Probably would’ve been my biggest
seller

ZACH

So a girlfriend a job where you
interact with actual people
Youre almost like a real person

STINE
Almost How are you

ZACH
I’m good I wish I could say I
didn’t feel like something was
missing But
(shrugs)
-eit’s all good

STINE
I know how you feel
(beat)
So I wrote you a story

ZACH
(face falls)
I thought those days were over

Stine smiles He pulls out one last manuscript in a leather
case and hands it to him

STINE
Just one story That’s it It’s
not even scary I think you’re
gonna like it

Zach gives Stine a long look Zach looks down at the book
LUD

ZACH
Are you sure I should open it

STINE
You don’t have to I already did

Stine smiles then with a tilt of his head indicates
Standing at the bow of the ferry

A girl - the exact image of Hannah She looks out on the
water the sun illuminating her from above

Zach is stunned He looks at the girl then back at Stine

STINE
Well what are you waiting for

Zach smiles then crosses over to talk to the girl

Seeing him Hannah smiles from ear to ear radiant as always
As Zach and the girl chat from across the ferry

Stine looks on with satisfaction and we

CUT TO

EXT LAKE - NIGHT
Allison and the other Cheerleaders are all hanging out
Dwayne and Alison remain in the backseat of her friend’s

PARKED CAR while the others frolic on the shore

INT CAR - BACKSEAT

Romantic stuff All the stars make an appearance Dwayne is
more confident than he’s ever been with a girl But still
struggling to find things to say

DWAYNE
So those SATs will be here
before you know it huh

ALLISON
Dwayne are you nervous

DWAYNE
Nervous Me After all I’ve been
through Please

Allison smiles and snuggles closer when-

DWAYNE
Ow

ALLISON
I’m sorry Did I hurt you
1Uo0

DWAYNE
(off his bandaged arm)
Noit’s just my stupid arm I
really gotta have that thing looked
at

ALLISON
Oh poor baby You want me to kiss
the boo boo
DWAYNE
Kiss the-- Uhmuh yeah yeah
sure That’d be great
As Allison gently kisses Dwayne’s wounded wrist

Dwayne looks up and silently mouths an excited “yes” It’s
about this time that Dwayne notices

»the FULL MOON above

Allison suddenly stops kissing Dwayne’s wrist as her eyes go
wide with terror

DWAYNE
What’s wrong Too much cologne

Then Dwayne sees what Allison sees

Long WOLF-LIKE HAIR growing out of his wrist As Dwayne’s
nails lengthen and his teeth sharpen-

Allison screams in horror and runs out of the car

Dwayne sits alone He somberly eyes his wolfen reflection in
the rearview mirror

DWAYNE
Damn now I’m never going to get
a girlfriend

Roll CREDITS Then

EXT ROAD - DAY

Officer Stevens and Officer Brooks have walked from their
PATROL CAR parked along the highway into a field where

the ill-fated MOVING TRUCK from the beginning of the movie
has been totaled and abandoned Its roof still shattered
Its back doors barely attached

OFFICER STEVENS
Looks like this heap’s been here
for years

OFFICER BROOKS
Indeed it do Indeed it do
1AVU
INT BACK OF TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

The doors are opened to reveal the empty cargo space
Officer Stevens and Officer Brooks peer around

OFFICER BROOKS
It’s empty Dang

Officer Stevens notices something stuck between the
floorboards - a single forgotten LEATHER-BOUND MANUSCRIPT

OFFICER STEVENS
Well what do we have here

OFFICER BROOKS
Looks old Might be worth
something
ON MANUSCRIPT -

We reveal the title of the book “SLAPPY’S REVENGE BY RL
STINE”

ON OFFICERS
OFFICER STEVENS
Slappy - that sounds real familiar
don’t it
Officer Brooks snatches the book
OFFICER BROOKS
I heard these guys found a million
dollars in an old storage facility
Then they got their own reality
show too Maybe this is our
ticket to the big time

Brooks absently pulls the lock off the book and just before
he opens it

Officer Stevens has his eureka

OFFICER STEVENS
Wait No no no no

Too late Brooks opens the book and grimaces and we
FADE TO BLACK
