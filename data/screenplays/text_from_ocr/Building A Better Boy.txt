EXT CIA HEADQUARTERS - ESTABLISHING

A swooping overhead shot of the foreboding compound An
insistent drumbeat pummels our ears

SUPER A TITLE CIA HEADQUARTERS LANGLEY VIRGINIA

INT CIA HQ HALLWAY - DAY

DR JAMES HARTLEY an ambitious scientist hustles to keep up
with COLONEL RAYMOND McFEE a pit bull of a bureaucrat

MCFEE
I just got off the phone with the
President

HARTLEY
Was heupset

MCFEE
A three billion dollar weapon is
missing Dr Hartley He’s
tickled

They pass an interrogation room where two agents wrestle an
uncooperative suspect to the ground

MCFEE (CONTD)
The good news is we have the
conspirators in custody It’s only
a matter of time before we extract
the location of the prototype

HARTLEY
If you could give me a minute alone
with them--

MCFEE
Absolutely not--

HARTLEY
Please Colonel This was my
project Five years of my life

They reach the LAST INTERROGATION ROOM McFee sighs

MCFEE
You can sit in -- but not a word
As far as I’m concerned the most
dangerous terrorists in America are
behind that door
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Hartley stands against the wall arms crossed along with two
armed agents

McFee’s in interrogation mode now He glares across a table
at the UNSEEN SUSPECTS

MCFEE
Let’s start from the beginning
How did you breach the network

No answer from the mysterious culprits

MCFEE (CONT’D)
Look If you refuse to talk it’s
only going to make it worse

After a moment of rustling A PAPER AIRPLANE flies back at
McFee nailing him in the forehead

Hartley can’t take any more He pushes past McFee shouting
into camera at the bad guys

HARTLEY
You think this is a joke You
stole classified military
technology That’s treason
Youre going to be locked away in a
country whose name you can’t
pronounce And I can guarantee
that you are not going to
Homecoming

REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL KATRINA and GABRIELLE High school
sophomores

Gabby has a hippie nerd vibe -- Birkenstocks and a tie-dye T-
shirt featuring Einstein sticking out his tongue Kat’s horn-
rimmed glasses exude emo angst She whimpers--

KAT
But But Dad

HARTLEY
Don’t start with me Katrina I
want you to stay in this room and
think about what you’ve done

Hartley SLAMS his fist on the table as we smash cut to--
EXT GLEN HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING - TO ESTABLISH

A perfectly normal public high school in suburban DC
pile out of buses dragging themselves to first period

KAT AND GABBY step off the bus with the rest of the

Kids

underclassmen herd They chat excitedly and nothing we see

suggests the high stakes drama we’ve just witnessed

CLACK ACROSS ANOTHER TITLE TWO DAYS EARLIER

Kat tells a story with a star-struck dreamy look

KAT
It was amazing On like an epic
scale He looked into my eyes and
there was this total connection

We FLASH into a DREAM SEQUENCE Over SULTRY MUSIC Kat
stares across a candle-lit table at

JADEN He’s a good-looking senior Effortlessly cool
his mop of hair falls over his blue eyes he is quite
possibly the cutest guy in the history of ever

JADEN
What would I do without you

Kat bats her eyes in idyllic soft focus

KAT
Aw Jaden You’re sweet

JADEN
I was lost and you saved me

A NEEDLE SCRATCH as Gabby shoves Kat back to reality
GABBY

It’s not love dude It’s pre-
calculus

FLASH BACK TO KAT’S MEMORY revealing that there are math

When

textbooks on the table Kat does Jaden’s homework for him

JADEN
I don’t know what I’d do without
you I was lost and you saved me

BACK TO KAT AND GABBY again

KAT
No no He totally wants me
GABBY
--to do his problem sets No
offense but there’s no way

Two students pass by Kat makes a point of saying hello

KAT
Hey Janice Hey Andrew

The other kids ignore Kat walking faster to avoid a
conversation Kat holds up her phone

KAT (CONTD)
So -- about Jaden I was thinking
I should definitely friend him

GABBY
He’s a Senior It’s proper
etiquette to let him friend you

KAT
Were 15 and 17 In primitive
cultures we could be married

GABBY
This is a primitive culture And
you don’t handle rejection well
Remember student council elections
in eighth grade

KAT
Oh that was so rigged

Another group of kids pass They are speaking Spanish

KAT (CONTD)
Ola comprades Que tal

The Spanish kids also ignore her Kat returns to her phone

KAT (CONTD)
As Julius Caesar once said “Non
dubitant” Do not hesitate

Jadens Facebook page is loaded up Kat pushes the “Send
Friend Request” button with a mini-squeal

GABBY
You know Caesar got stabbed right

KAT
Yes But to this day we enjoy the
salad that bears his name
INT AP CALCULUS CLASS - DAY

MR FRAGNER a droll man in an ugly sweater hands out
quizzes

Except for Kat and Gabby it’s a class full of seniors And
they all hate them for wrecking the bell curve

MR FRAGNER
The quiz covers chapters four and
five You may begin now

The students flip their quizzes over and begin scribbling
We pan up to the clock over the door it’s 200pm

The clock FAST FORWARDS - a little - to 208pm

Mr Fragner looks up to see Kat and Gabby standing in front
of him smiling brightly

GABBY
We’re umdone

MR FRAGNER
Why don’t you go back and check
your work

Gabby’s eyes wander skyward She takes a two-second beat to
check all her work -- in her head

GABBY
Yep Still done

KAT
If there’s extra credit for
finishing first I finished first
but if there’s no extra credit then
don’t worry about it

GABBY
Mister Fragner since it’s eighth
period may we go outside Vitamin
D is essential for healthy skin

Fragner hands them hall passes As Kat and Gabby leave a
kid whispers under his breath

STUDENT
Dorks

The rest of the class bursts into STIFLED LAUGHTER
EXT GLEN HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - SAME
Kat and Gabrielle walk down the front steps

GABBY
He said “dorks”

KAT
He distinctly said sporks It’s
the world’s most versatile utensil

Kat is smiling ear to ear Nearly hopping

GABBY
Do you have to pee or something

KAT
Pee happiness maybe
(holding up her phone)
Check it out

GABBY
No way Jaden texted you

KAT
He didn’t accept the friend
request He texted me Much more
personal The speed of the
response bodes very well

Gabby reads the message aloud

GABBY
“Hey Kat Meet me at football
field after practis” with an S
“IT have an important Q to ask
letter U C U Lader with aD
Jaden” Wow Even auto-correct
can’t help this kid

KAT
He wants to ask me to Homecoming
I can feel it

Kat walks with purpose Gabby hurries to keep up

GABBY
What do you mean feel it Like the
way you get gassy when you eat
broccoli
EXT GLEN HILLS HIGH’S FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY
Varsity football practice is in full swing

COACH VOSS barks commands as the football players crisscross
the field He has the kind of intensity that you find in
high school gym teachers serial killers and Gary Busey

COACH
It’s all about one word men
Focus Heart Defense Tenacity

Kat and Gabby climb into the bleachers Kat’s gaze is locked
on JADEN He’s the team’s star quarterback

GABBY
This is so ill-advised

KAT
When Jaden comes over act normal
Like don’t say anything smart

Two of the football players get in a shoving match which
devolves into a wrestling match on the ground

GABBY
Ugh If that’s acting normal
unsubscribe me

Jaden jogs over to get a cup of Gatorade Despite his alpha-
hottie status he’s a surprisingly decent kid

KAT
Hey Jaden Hi

JADEN
Oh Hey

KAT
Looking good out there

GABBY
Absolutely You are a winner sir

JADEN
What are you guys doing here
Shouldn’t you be in class

KAT
We blew that off Blew it off
emphatically

GABBY
We finished early
Kat kicks Gabby under the stands

KAT
Did you want to talk to me

JADEN
Totally But I gotta get back out
there Can you hang

KAT
Sure We love to hang out

GABBY
Were really great at it

Jaden puts his helmet back on and returns to the field Kat
is almost hyperventilating

KAT
Oh Magoo He is so into me

NEVAEH (ne-VAY-uh) BARNES Jaden’s girlfriend approaches
with the cheerleading squad She’s blonde black-hearted and
beautiful A future reality TV star

She looks at Kat and Gabby with distaste

NEVAEH
What’s this A meeting of the
young lesbians club This is a
closed practice

KAT
We were invited to be here

GABBY
Yeah So why don’t you go yell
some letters in unison

NEVEAH
Easy honey badger Katrina do
you honestly think that Jaden would
ask you to homecoming

Kat looks up blindsided Nevaeh holds up an iPhone

NEVAEH
He forgot his phone at my house
last night We hung out for three
hours in my rec room unsupervised

GABBY
Gross
NEVAEH
I’m not going to go into everything
that happened because I’m a lay-
day But here’s the headline he
asked moi to Homecoming Which is
what everyone knew would happen
except the school geniuses

The cheer team snickers Kat wants to die Gabby glares at
Neveah

GABBY
Why do people even like you

NEVEAH
She tried to friend my boyfriend

KAT
I wasn’t trying to--

NEVAEH
I know a crush when I smell one
So back off Math Club

The whistle blows to end practice Jaden jogs to the
sidelines

Nevaeh kisses Jaden on the cheek and hands him his phone

NEVAEH (CONTD)
Here you go honey

JADEN
Thanks Oh Kat -- what I wanted to
ask you was um can you e-mail me
the Chapter Three solutions

Kat nods trying to hide how crushed she is

JADEN (CONTD)
You saved me again

The words hit Kat like daggers Jaden runs off to the locker
room with the rest of the team

NEVEAH
That will be all now girls

Kat starts walking away defeated But Gabby turns
defiantly and calls after Neveah--

GABBY
Have fun at Homecoming Kat’s
date’s going to be way hotter

NEVAEH
Whatever
KAT
(hushed)

Gabs What are you doing

GABBY

I got this

(back at Neveah)
I’m serious Kat’s boyfriend
Total hotburger His name’s
Albert he’s a Senior He shreds
on a skateboard And he volunteers
with animals Orphan animals

The other cheerleaders let out an immediate “awwww”

NEVAEH
She’s lying

GABBY
He lives in Alaska

NEVAEH
Where he skateboards

GABBY
Youve heard of the X games He’s
in the Y games He uses glaciers
for half pipes and people are
like “Why”

There’s a tiny hint of worry on Neveah’s face But she waves
it off and lines up to start a cheer routine

NEVAEH
Ill be sure to tell everyone about

this big romance of yours We’re
all holding our breath

EXT STUDENT PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

Kat and Gabby walk to the parking lot Passing students are
already checking their phones laughing and cat-calling

PASSING STUDENT
Hey Kat Where’s your boyfriend

The group of Spanish exchange students walk by and whistle

SPANISH STUDENT
Donde es tu amor eh Ay yai yai

KAT
Great Now I’m a loser and a liar

GABBY
Relax I have a plan

BART (0S)
Ahoy ladies Need a ride

KAT
Oh joy - my brother Now the
nightmare is complete

A 1982 lime green Cadillac El Dorado a boat of a vehicle
rolls up next to them

At the wheel Kat’s brother BART He’s a year older all
gangly limbs and awkward energy Until he’s old enough to go
to Comic Con social life might be tough for this kid

BART
The new ride Pretty sick right

GABBY
I think your muffler is killing
dolphins as we speak

Gabby and Kat climb in

Bart’s car rolls away REVEALING the bumper sticker “They
call it WarCRAFT because it takes SKILL”

INT BART’S CAR - DAY

They Might Be Giants plays on the radio Gabby fiddles with
the dashboard as Bart pats the steering wheel with pride

KAT
This thing smells like BO and
grandparents

BART
And freedom Forty hours a week
bagging groceries and I am mo-bile

Kat points to the dashboard

KAT
That’s a cassette player It means
you have to listen to all the songs
in the same orderevery time

BART
Whatever - I’m not the one who just
got owned by Neveah Barnes It’s
already blowing up on Twitter

KAT
Yeah Well your face is blowing up
on Zitter

GABBY
Would you two call a truce Like
I said - I have a plan

INT THE HARTLEY HOME - DAY

Kat’s house is pure suburban McMansion Her mom PEGGY sits
at the kitchen table on her computer grading college papers

PEGGY
How was school girls

KAT
Rote memorization Ritual shaming
The usual

PEGGY
There are TV dinners in the freezer
- go to town You guys want to
grade some Shakespeare essays

KAT
Sounds raucous but we’ll pass

GABBY
I’m going to build Kat a boyfriend

Peggy doesn’t look up from her Powerbook

PEGGY

Okay Have fun

INT KAT’S ROOM - EVENING
Gabby and Kat plop on the bed Kat’s room is covered with
posters of her heroes Einstein Steve Jobs Ken Jennings
(the Jeopardy tiber-champ) and Walter from Breaking Bad

GABBY

Let me ask you a question Do we
settle for second best in school

KAT
Duh No

GABBY
Okay So why do we settle for boys
that want to date cheer leading
demon spawn

KAT
Easy for you to say Didn’t you
meet a boy at computer camp

GABBY
It was a fling while I was teaching
him java code But we’re talking
about you

KAT
Don’t bother I’m hopeless

Gabby stands up - delivering a kind of manifesto

GABBY
As my hero computer genius Alan Kay
once said “I don’t predict the
future I invent it” Why can’t
we invent you a boyfriend

Kat considers the idea Her interest is piqued

KAT
I think you better sleep over

GABBY
Let me ask my mom

Gabby sends a text and waits two and a half seconds

GABBY (CONT’D)
Okay I can

INT KAT’S ROOM - LATER

Gabby sits at Kat’s computer furiously typing code Kat
looks on feasting on a Stoeffer’s frozen dinner

GABBY
Well start with a SMS bot that can
auto-generate text messages If we
create a unique voice he can even
leave you messages

KAT
Is this dishonest and gross

GABBY
Yes But it’s better than letting
Nevaeh win

KAT
Start a Facebook profile

Gabby drags images of hot guys off the internet Abercrombie

and Fitch models -- Justins Bieber and Timberlake -- Ryans
Gosling and Lochte -- and the entirety of One Direction
GABBY

We can make him look like anything
We’ll build him to order like a
Mini-Cooper or a foot-long sub

The pictures are pulled together into a Photoshop file
Gabby melds them morphs them shaping a single boy’s face

GABBY (CONTD)
Black hair

KAT

Nah--Brown With blue eyes
GABBY

Meow-zers
KAT

He’1l be super cute obviously
But he doesn’t know it

KAT AND GABBY
Which makes him even cuter

They swoon at the thought Gabby’s clicking furiously with
the mouse She’s getting into it now

GABBY
He should be like super polite

KAT
Yeah Like almost British

GABBY
He’1ll be sensitive He’ll pay
attention He’1ll be brave and
strong without being a meathead

LINES OF CODE fill the monitor as Gabby’s fingers FLY over
the keyboard She has the wild look of a scientist in mid-
creation Kat grabs Gabby’s arm

KAT
Gabs This is like the sweetest
thing anyone’s ever done for me

GABBY
Hey Friends don’t let friends
date losers
(with a final keytap)
Here we go Prepare yourself for
Albert Version 10

Gabby and Kat lean in and then there’s a computer DING and
they jump back in SHOCK

ON SCREEN “ALBERT 10” is a MESS

His image is badly pixillated mash-up of cute boy parts with
mismatched eyes and a creepy oversized head

He’s the Frankenstein of avis and he croaks out a metallic
monotone voice

ALBERT 10
I -- luff -- you -- Katrina

Even his pronunciation is off the way he says “Katrina”
rhymes with a certain part of female anatomy

KAT
Eww

GABBY
This graphics processor sucks And
why is your internet so slow

Kat looks at the ceiling with disgust

INT UPSTAIRS IN BART’S ROOM - SAME

Bart sits in front of a preposterously large flat screen TV
He’s got a headset on and he’s playing CALL OF DUTY

BART
Ill take the guy on the upper
right You flank left

OTHER PLAYERS shout orders and taunts at each other

ON SCREEN Bart’s soldier sneaks up on another team’s player

and shoots him in the back

BART (CONT’D)
Yes Eat your own entrails

KAT
(poking her head in)
Bart can you stop Bogarting the
bandwidth

BART
I’m in the middle of a war here

ON SCREEN Bart’s soldier gets gutted with a bayonet

BART (CONTD)
Aghh Same team Same team
And I’m dead

INT HALLWAY AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRS - SAME
Kat rejoins Gabby shaking her head in frustration

KAT
No dice

GABBY
So are we done for the night

KAT
My dad has a wiMax line in his
office He’d kill me if he caught
us in there If he catches us

INT OUTSIDE KAT’S DADS OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

Down the hall in the kitchen we can see that Peggy has

fallen asleep grading papers

Kat and Gabby approach a foreboding mahogany door

It is

secured with the kind of keypad LOCK they use on bank vaults

Kat punches in numbers the door opens with a WHOOSH

GABBY
Your mom’s birthday

KAT
Anniversary

GABBY
Aww Cute
INT HARTLEY’S OFFICE - SAME

It’s packed with the highest of high tech computer equipment
Kat flips a switch and the giant computer hums to life

GABBY
Dual quad-core platinum alloy
procks This rig is sick

KAT
My dad got it from his new company
He’s working on another video game
It’s all top secret or whatever

GABBY
That’s so cool

KAT
Gabby it’s my dad I mean what
tech company works on a project for
five years without releasing it
EXT THE PENTAGON - DAY

The headquarters of the Department of Defense

A TITLE CLACKS ACROSS THE PENTAGON

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

High ranking generals and military analysts are
around a conference table

DR HARTLEY stands at the front of the room

HARTLEY
Gentlemen I give you the X-17
Prototype the world’s first Covert
Robotic Operative

assembled

A POWER POINT PRESENTATION lights up behind him displaying
blueprints of an intricate ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY LINE

HARTLEY (CONT’D)
Cutting-edge intelligence
Complete genetic design

Colonel McFee stands at Hartley’s side projecting

confidence

MCFEE
These prototype soldiers will be
specifically fabricated for each
mission They will generate their
own movement and thought and can be
fluent in any language

A four star general named FORMAN peers at the diagram

GENERAL FORMAN
What’s the power source

HARTLEY
A combination of solar polymers in
the skin and a friction-powered
generator in the hip turbine

The generals nod impressed McFee makes a closing pitch

MCFEE
Were ready to begin as soon as the
Joint Chiefs give the say-so This
could be the new American soldier

The analysts nod Only General Forman looks skeptical

GENERAL FORMAN
I didn’t think the old model was so
bad What are the safeguards
What if this thing falls into the
wrong hands

MCFEE
The fail-safes are iron clad sir

DR HARTLEY
If there is ever the slightest hint
of a malfunction the prototype has
a remote over-ride that can be
controlled by a single mission
commander

That seems to satisfy the general and he stands up

GENERAL FORMAN
Ill report back to the Joint
Chiefs and let you know their
decision

HARTLEY
Excuse me General but-- How long
will that take exactly

GENERAL FORMAN
Could be a day Could be a year

Hartley pales A year The general laughs

GENERAL FORMAN (CONT’D)
Patience Doctor Hartley You work
for the government now

The review team walks out Hartley looks discouraged but
Colonel McFee has fire in his eyes

MCFEE

That was great I haven’t seen
them that excited since I previewed
the G-12 tank

(smiling at the memory)
The way that thing could blow a
hole through a building was a thing
of beauty

Dr Hartley nods supportive but vaguely frightened

EXT THE PENTAGON - MINUTES LATER

McFee and Hartley walk out the front door of the Pentagon
shaking hands on a successful presentation

Over an ominous drumbeat we REVEAL that they are being
watched through a high powered TELESCOPE

Voices confer in RUSSIAN ACCENTS over walkie-talkies

RUSSIAN VOICE (ON WALKIE)
They’re leaving

The scope sight magnifies ZOOMING IN on Dr Hartley
2ND RUSSIAN VOICE (ON WALKIE)
Thank you for your brilliant
creation Doctor We only steal
from the best
INT HARTLEY’S OFFICE - SAME

We begin on a CLOSE UP OF HARTLEY - a FRAMED PHOTO on a
bookshelf

He’s posing with his family PEGGY BART AND KAT

PULL BACK FARTHER TO REVEAL GABBY AND KAT sitting at
Hartley’s desk Gabby types furiously

GABBY
The security on this software is
nuts It’s protected by like
twenty encryptions

KAT
My dad’s paranoid I can’t even
get clearance for a wonder bra

GABBY
I didn’t say I couldn’t break it

With a single key tap the screen changes to read

“CHARACTER DESIGN INTERFACE TOP SECRET ACCESS ONLY”

KAT
Nice dude

Gabby shrugs yeah Im awesome and plugs in a USB drive and
uploads their fake Albert profile page to the system

The processor WHIRS and an entire human GENOME SEQUENCE
begins to assemble on the screen in front of Kat and Gabby

GABBY
Whoa It’s doing something with
our data It’s creating some kind
of virtual DNA

They stare at the computer screen for a second Gabby’s
entranced - Kat chews a twizzler looking impatient

GABBY (CONTD)
Remember that old Matthew Broderick
movie where they hacked into what
they thought was a video game and
almost blew up the world

KAT
Focus Gabs We’re building me a
boyfriend This is important

The system spins for a few seconds and suddenly there’s a
response DATA ACCEPTED BEGIN PROTOTYPE CREATION

The screen fills with plain yellow text
KAT (CONTD)

Look at that interface No wonder
they haven’t released this game

GABBY
It wants more data Look at this
“Enter Geopolitcial Affinity”

KAT
I don’t know Griffindor
GABBY

Gabby nods and types then reads the next prompt

GABBY

KAT

GABBY

KAT

Taking me to Homecoming
A screen comes up with the heading “CAPABILITIES” across the
top There are categories like “Intelligence” “Maturity”
and “Sensitivity” on a scale from 1 to 100

Kat grabs the mouse and moves every slider up to 100

KAT (CONTD)
Go big or go home I always say

Gabby clicks the enter key and they sit and wait while the
hard drive spins
INT THE ROBOTICS LAB - THE PENTAGON - NIGHT

The massive computer servers start to HUM

INT KAT’S HOUSE - SAME

Kat and Gabby stare expectantly at the monitor There’s a
“DING” from the computer Kat and Gabby look at each other

GABBY
Here we go Albert 20

The screen goes blank and suddenly

THE NEW ALBERT appears on screen

This is a serious upgrade He’s gorgeous Albert peers out
from the monitor all dreamy confidence and smiles

ALBERT
What’s up

Kat and Gabby stare for a moment trying not to drool

GABBY
Wow He’s in HD

KAT

An RandB JAM starts to play through the speakers Kat
stammers No one’s ever talked to her like this

KAT

Kat pulls Gabby across the room

GABBY
The code is working He must have
latched on to you through facial
recognition

KAT

Rings

Gabby
GABBY

Seriously don’t overheat it

EXT HALLWAY - SAME

Gabby sneaks outside the office and gingerly closes the door
She smiles proud of herself for helping Kat

BART (0S)
Busted

Gabby turns to find BART leaning in the shadows
Gah

GABBY
Lurk much

BART

Youre trespassing in my dad’s
office That is a major offense
This is going to get ugly And by
ugly I mean awesome

INT KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Bart loads peanut butter banana and a chocolate bar onto two
pieces of bread and closes it in the panini maker

GABBY

What would it take to get you to
keep your mouth shut

BART

You can’t afford it

GABBY

I could re-code your Call of Duty
character so you never die Like a
Zombie Or Madonna

BART

And miss a chance to sell Kat down
the river Please

GABBY

There’s got to be something

BART

Homecoming You and me

GABBY

Unthinkable

BART

Expand your mind

GABBY

I’ve got a boyfriend From
computer camp

BART

That’s unfortunate Because that’s
my dads car pulling in

Gabby turns

indeed a pair of headlights have turned up the

drive She panics and turns to Bart

GABBY
dust the dance No pictures or any
of that crap And if you bring a
corsage I will punch you

They shake on it She scurries back down the hall as

DR HARTLEY enters He’s exhausted - but heading for his
office Bart scrambles to block his way

BART
Dad Hi How was work

HARTLEY
Fine thanks

BART
Take a load off I’ve been
thinking we should hang out more

HARTLEY
How much money do you want Is
twenty enough

INT HARTLEY’S OFFICE - SAME

Kat stands in the center of the room her face lit up by the
computer monitor’s LCD glow

Albert’s love mix plays Kat takes cautious steps towards
the monitor closer to Albert’s pixilated face

ALBERT
You’re so pretty

KAT
Gabby programmed you to say that

ALBERT
That doesn’t mean I’m lying

KAT
So cheesy And so effective

Kat leans closer Albert’s image lighting up her face

ALBERT
Do you have a boyfriend

KAT
No I guess I just haven’t found
the right model

Kat moves even closer taking the monitor in both hands
pulling Albert close

GABBY opens the door peeking in just as--

Kat plants a KISS on the collection of LCD pixels that are
Albert’s lips

A SPARK OF STATIC ELECTRICITY jumps out from the screen
knocking Kat back

ALBERT’S IMAGE shimmers jumps and DISAPPEARS A message
flashes across the screen

FABRICATION SEQUENCE ENGAGED

Then - with a ZAP and a POP - the computer CRASHES and the
screen goes black

Gabby runs over and taps the keyboard Nothing

GABBY
Uh oh The circuits are fried

Kats flat on her back staring at the ceiling in a reverie

KAT
I know I’m likeWhoa

INT HARTLEY KITCHEN - SAME
Bart pours a couple of sodas over ice

BART
It’s girls Dad I need to know
How do their minds work

HARTLEY
Have you checked Wikipedia

BART
You and mom have suchpassion

ANGLE ON PEGGY slumped over in her robe at the dining room
table SNORING

BART (CONTD)
I bet in high school you macked
with tons of females or as you
generation calls them “sweet
little chickadees”

Bart opens a drawer next to the silverware It’s full of
ibuprofen band aids and LIQUID ALLERGY MEDICINE The
label says Night time Drowsy Formula Bart covertly pours
the red goop into Hartley’s drink as he talks

HARTLEY

I wasn’t exactly Don Juan Women
are the last great mystery After
carbon-neutral fuel of course

BART
Well It doesn’t take a genius to
know what women want But I

figureit can’t hurt to ask one
(offering a glass)
Diet cherry soda
TIME JUMP TO
HARTLEY PASSED OUT

In an armchair in the living room Bart snaps next to his
ear He’s out cold

BART (CONTD)
Pleasant dreams pop

Bart removes the empty glass of Sleepytime Cola from the side
table strolls past the dining room where his mom is still
asleep and walks down the hall to Hartley’s office

BART (CONTD)
Coast is clear Let me in

GABBY (0S)
Okay But don’t be mad

Gabby opens the door Bart walks inside aghast

His father’s super-computer has been CRACKED OPEN and is
lying in pieces all over the floor

GABBY (CONTD)
We had a bit of a problem

Kat’s still lying on the floor love-drunk and giggling

KAT
Uh oh Big brother is watching us

Her iPHONE rings She checks the caller ID and amazingly
it says “ALBERT”

KAT (CONTD)
Hello
(looking at Gabby)
Gabby It’s him

Gabby and Kat hop up and down They’re excited that the
invention works - but to Bart they just look boy crazy

KAT (CONTD)
Sorry I have to take this

Kat sneaks outside cuddling the phone Bart turns to Gabby

BART
Seriously

EXT THE HARTLEY HOUSE - NIGHT
Kat stands in the moonlight shivering against the cold
KAT
I can’t believe you’re really

calling me

ALBERT
I feel like we have a connection

KAT
Me too It’s the internet

ALBERT
This probably sounds cheesy but
I’ve never felt this way before

KAT
I believe you

The front door of the house opens It’s PEGGY She smirks
at Kat sleepy and slightly annoyed

PEGGY
Katrina Hartley It’s late

KAT
Sorry Mom It’s -- a boy

Peggy looks surprised And pleased She softens
PEGGY
Youre lucky your father is asleep

One minute

Peggy shuts the door again

KAT
I should go

ALBERT
I just wanted to hear your voice
again Good night

KAT
Good night Albert

Kat hangs up the phone actually melting a little Then she
catches herself--

KAT (CONTD)

Omigod Kat you are pathetic He’s
not a boy - he’s an app

INT HARTLEY’S OFFICE - SAME

BART

KAT
So maybe I get grounded until

BART
Girls are ridiculous

KAT
Yes we’re aware

Bart starts for the door--
GABBY

Bart turns He wants it pretty badly

EXT THE HARTLEY HOUSE - THE NEXT MORNING

Suburban tranquility Birds chirp idyllic chirps

INT LIVING ROOM - SAME

Hartley opens his eyes groggy He’s still slumped in the
recliner in his work clothes from the day before

Kat and Gabby walk by quickly dressed for school

KAT
Hi Dad Bye Dad

Hartley sits up with a start Peggy leans in the doorway
with a mug of coffee

PEGGY
Morning sleepyhead

HARTLEY
I crashed hard On the bright
side my allergies cleared up

Hartley stands up woozy and wanders down the hall to his
office He yawns and punches the entry key code It doesn’t
work He punches it again and frowns

HARTLEY (CONT’D)
Hello Is someone in there

INT HARTLEY’S LOCKED OFFICE - SAME

BART looks up in a panic He’s wearing goggles and holding a
SOLDERING GUN over the computer’s motherboard

INT HALLWAY - SAME

Hartley tries his key code but it doesn’t work He’s about
to take action when

His CELL PHONE rings

HARTLEY
Colonel McFee Good morning

INTERCUT WITH

COLONEL MCFEE RIDING IN THE BACK OF A HUMVEE

MCFEE
Hartley I’ve been trying to reach

HARTLEY
I’m sorry I’m not sure myself

MCFEE
There’s beenan incident I need

HARTLEY

MCFEE

Yes I made sure of that

Outside Hartley’s front window we see

A BLACK HUMVEE screech to a stop in the circular driveway

INT HARTLEY’S OFFICE - SAME
Bart looks out the window incredulous as his dad climbs in
the Humvee and it peels away
EXT SUBURBAN ROAD - MORNING

On a wooded suburban road the Black Humvee barrels past a
SCHOOL BUS

INT SCHOOL BUS - SAME
Inside the bus Kat and Gabby are lost in conversation
KAT
I can’t believe you told Bart you’d
go to homecoming with him
GABBY
Only if we don’t get caught So
there’s no way it will happen

The bus stops As a boy gets on he SMILES AT KAT

FRIENDLY BOY
Hey Katrina

KAT
Hey
(she does a double take)
Wait-- did you say hi to me

The boy keeps walking But Kat notices that many other kids
on the bus are smiling and waving

KAT (CONTD)
That’s weird

Gabby holds up her phone with a goofy GRIN

GABBY
Omigosh Kat

A PICTURE OF ALBERT stares out from her phone screen
GABBY (CONTD)
I have a new friend request from
Albert Banks His profile says
he’s in a relationship with you

Kat stares at the phone then back up at Gabby

KAT
Did you post this

Gabby shakes her head no

KAT (CONTD)
Then who did

Gabby shrugs I have no idea

EXT GLEN HILLS HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Kat and Gabby climb off the bus Amazingly a few more kids

smile and say hi to them Gabby’s checking her phone

GABBY
He already has 96 friends

KAT
How is this happening

GABBY
The code must have gone viral

KAT
Great My boyfriend has a virus

That’s when they run smack dab into NEVAEH She looks
terrifyingly stunning as always

KAT (CONTD)
Neveah What a pleasant surprise

NEVEAH
Oh I’m the shocked one Your
boyfriend Facebooked me Talk
about Gorgey McGorgeous Don’t I
feel silly now

This is the moment Kat wanted But a bunch of other kids
starting to gather around and she gets shy

KAT
I should really get to class

NEVEAH
No no I owe you an apology

KAT
Well People make mistakes

GABBY
Especially you

Neveah fixes Kat with a knowing sneer

NEVAEH
I didn’t think you had it in you
I mean to go home to your
powerMacs and diddle yourself up a
fake Facebook boyfriend It’s so
obvious it’s painful

are

Kat looks like she’s about to fold under the pressure and
admit the whole thing

KAT
Youre -- wrong Tell her Gabby
Gabby

At first Kat’s insulted that Gabby isn’t telling Neveah off
Then she follows Gabby’s slack-jawed gaze as

A BEAUTIFUL RED FERRARI pulls up at the curb

It’s a vision in cherry red chrome and its tinted windows
reflect the sun

Neveah and the other high schoolers stare in awe as
ALBERT emerges
The dream boy In the flesh He walks right up to Kat

ALBERT
Surprise

KAT
Hi UmHow are you here

ALBERT
My dad got a job in DC Ambassador
of Eskimo affairs
(turning to Neveah)
Hey if it isn’t Facebook friend
82 Neveah That’s Heaven spelled
backwards right

All the other kids are checking out the Ferrari kicking the
tires Kat pulls Gabby aside

KAT
UhWhat Is Happening

GABBY
I don’t know And I actually
understand how cold fusion works
Maybe he’s a hologram

Kat decides to find out She walks up to Albert and puts her
arm around him feeling his flesh as she hugs him

KAT
I can’t believe it’s you Your
arms Your shoulders

Kat’s getting into the petting moving her hands lower

KAT (CONTD)
Your absthese awesome diagonal
creases where most people have
belly fat

Gabby pulls Kat away Neveah’s friends are staring at her
waiting for a quip or a snappy retort

NEVEAH
I don’t know what you guys are up
to I don’t get it

GABBY
That’s for sure

The other kids laugh Neveah fumes Albert looks around
ALBERT
Hey Can anyone show me to the

registrar’s office

About ten girls shout “I can I can”

EXT OUTSIDE WASHINGTON DC - DAY

McFee’s humvee speeds through the streets of DC

INT THE HUMVEE - SAME

Hartley sits in the back seat with Colonel McFee A couple
of sour-faced men in black suits ride with them

HARTLEY
FunnyI’ve never taken this route
to the Pentagon

MCFEE
We’re not going to the Pentagon
As it happens the CIA also has an
interest in our little project

HARTLEY
Really Since when

MCFEE
Three years ago

EXT CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

The security area around the entrance is a mess of broken
glass and warning tape No one’s being allowed inside but
McFee Hartley and the agents with them are waved in

INT HALLWAY —- DAY

A tough young female agent named JENKS intercepts McFee in
the hall Hartley struggles to keep up

AGENT JENKS
We notified Washington PD Gave
them just physical description
nothing more

MCFEE
Good Keep it that way

AGENT JENKS
Colonel is there any chance you
can tell me what’s going on

MCFEE
See for yourself

McFee opens a door at the end of the hallway revealing--

INT A ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY LAB - SAME
A sprawling lab space Technicians scurry in all directions
A ROBOTIC ASSEMBLY APPARATUS looms in the center of the room

Just like the one from Hartley’s proposal An assembly line
of conveyors capsules and robotic assembly arms

HARTLEY
Wait--you already built it

MCFEE
We followed your specifications
exactly with a few modifications
for the CIA’s needs

Hartley’s mind is blown Two lab assistants named FRITZ and
IVAN approach a little star-struck

FRITZ
Were big fans of your work Dr
Hartley It’s been a true honor to
make it a reality

Hartley shakes their hands numbly

MCFEE
What’s the status on the X-17 Are
we picking up any tracking signal

IVAN
I’m afraid not Colonel

HARTLEY
You assembled a prototype

AGENT JENKS
(to McFee)
You didn’t tell him

INT LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME

McFee and Hartley stare at grainy security footage of a
figure grabbing a lab coat and walking out of the CIA lab

IVAN
It was late last night The
activation signal came in over the
remote network

FRITZ
We didn’t think it was possible
But someone infiltrated the system
designed their own prototype
remotelyand activated it

Hartley stares out at the assembly machine

HARTLEY
I can’t believe it worked

MCFEE
Worked Your little invention
walked out right past security
Agent Jenks - how could this have
happened

AGENT JENKS
He -- I mean the prototype -- was
coming from the classified area
Everyone assumed he had clearance

HARTLEY
Do we have any record of his
appearance Or what he was deigned
to do

IVAN
The signal executed and destroyed
itself Whoever did this was good

HARTLEY
Are there any details about his
appearance Anything remarkable

Jenks pauses a moment She chooses her words carefully

AGENT JENKS
From the reports I’ve gotten He
was distinctly Adorable Sir

Off Hartley’s reaction we cut to--

EXT THE FRONT STEPS OF GLEN HILLS HIGH - NOON

We start close on ALBERT He is adorable And he’s holding
court with half a dozen of the school’s fiercest skate punks

ALBERT
I don’t think of it as
snowboarding I think of it as
forging a mystical connection to
the mountain Entering the place
where your soul flies It’s a
sensation that the Inuit people
call Teeenngg-eee-Yooookkk

The skaters nod This dude has lived

Albert grabs a spare board and heads down the front steps
He hops onto a rail and slides down it with ease

He executes a perfect landing a sick Ollie air walk and
then hops back onto a railing for another flight of stairs

He lands goofy and rolls up next to Kat He smiles and waves
at Kat who’s standing next to a star-struck FRESHMAN GIRL

FRESHMAN GIRL
He is so amazing He’s like UHHHH
‘Cause he’s like a boy-boy but
he’s also like sweet He’s
emotionally ambidextrous

Meanwhile Gabby sits in the shade on her cell phone

GABBY
So how’s it going MacGuyver

INT HARTLEY’S HOME OFFICE - SAME

Bart’s still trying to put Humpty Supercomputer back together
again The floor is a mess of microchips

BART
Complete fail

GABBY
Well school dances are overrated

BART
I hope you appreciate that I am
missing a Spanish quiz for you

GABBY
Did you re-set the transceiver

BART
Yes Still dead

GABBY
Did you switch the memory chip

BART
No but the memory card isn’t--

GABBY
The refractory memory chip

BART
(the light bulb goes on)
Ohhhhhhh
GABBY

Call me when it’s done

BART
This boyfriend from camp Is he a
burly guy would you say--

As Gabby hangs up she turns to see ALBERT who is now
holding court with a group of senior guys

ALBERT
And I said hey don’t thank me
for sparring with you Thank you
for being Pac-Man the people’s
champion

Albert shows a photo on his phone He poses post-workout
with a smiling MANNY PACQUIAO The other guys trade awed
looks Albert is fast approaching legend status

EXT GYM CLASS - LATER THAT DAY
Jaden does PUSH-UPS His partner calls out his reps
JADEN’S GYM PARTNER

Nice Beat my record by two
We PAN DOWN the row Everyone else is done except Albert
Albert’s partner counts off perfect reps
ALBERT’S PARTNER
Hundred sixty Hundred sixty one
hundred sixty two hundred--dude

slow down I can’t count that fast--

Gabby and Kat in the usual grotesque gym outfits marvel at
their own handiwork

NEVEAH looks on with disgust

COACH VOSS takes a closer look at Albert

COACH VOSS
Hey kid You ever play football in
Alaska

ALBERT

We only get twenty days of sunlight
per school year But I like to
throw salmon into my dad’s boat

COACH VOSS
Gleason Go long

A kid takes off running Coach Voss flips Albert a football

COACH VOSS (CONTD)
Try this fish on for size

Albert spots the kid forty yards down field

He cocks his arm and we hear an almost robotic whir as it
SNAPS forward The football ZINGS through the air and

NAILS the kid in the chest knocking him five yards back
KAT AND GABBY watch from the sidelines Whoa

Jaden’s amazed - and a little threatened He’s not Big Man
on Campus anymore

EXT GLEN HILLS HIGH - END OF THE SCHOOL DAY

The last period bell rings and students pile out of every
exit door Katrina and Gabby are among them

Jaden spots them and runs to catch up

JADEN
Hey -- Kat

KAT
Oh hey Jaden what’s up

JADEN
You never e-mailed me those Chapter
Three answers

KAT
Oh man - I totally spaced it

The red Ferrari rolls up to the curb Albert donning
aviator sunglasses taps on the car’s horn

ALBERT
Who wants to hit the mall

Kat lights up with a smile Jaden looks worried

JADEN
But - what am I supposed to do

Kat shrugs

KAT
I don’t know maybestudy

Kat climbs in next to Albert

The Ferrari pulls away with the rumble of a jet engine
leaving Jaden behind

INT ALBERT’S FERRARI - DAY

Albert drives with the top down Gabby and Kat sit in back

ALBERT
Not bad for a first day

GABBY
Okay honestly Albert How are you
real I don’t understand
ALBERT
That’s very complicated And
honestly super boring That is
such a cute shirt on you Kat

KAT
Thanks

GABBY
Can we focus please

KAT
Maybe my dad’s working on a really
cutting edge game

GABBY
Avatar was cutting edge This is
nuts Where did you get the car

ALBERT
That’s one of the bonuses of
materializing out of thin air You
have perfect credit

He fans out a colorful array of CREDIT CARDS
GABBY
I don’t know I think we should go
back and help Bart
ALBERT
Look I’m supposed to take Kat to
Homecoming If she’s going to be
my date she has to look hot
Kat turns to Gabby with a beaming shameless shrug
KAT
Can’t argue with logic

INT BLOOMINGDALES - SAME

Albert and the girls walk up to the counter There’s a
twenty-something SALESGIRL working behind the counter

ALBERT
Hi there We’d like to buy a few
things for the Homecoming dance

The salesgirl looks at Albert then at Kat and smiles

SALESGIRL
How sweet Buying an outfit for
your little sister

Uh oh Kat stares at the floor pretty much wanting to die

KAT
Let’s go Let’s just go

ALBERT
This is not my sister She’s my
girlfriend

SALESGIRL

I’m so sorry

ALBERT
Our love is like nothing that has
existed in the history of the
universe We are writing a story
of passion across the stars

SALESGIRL
I understand

ALBERT
I don’t think you do

Albert climbs up on the counter Kat’s mortified--

KAT
Oh God

SALESGIRL
Sir Please don’t do that sir

ALBERT
What I feel for Kat goes beyond
love When all is said and done
what do we live for Glee reruns
Mineral baths Dark chocolate

ALL THE WOMEN shopping in the vicinity turn to listen

ALBERT (CONTD)
No We live for that moment of
magic That moment when we find
another person who gets us It’s
like breathing for the first time
Or a 3-D movie that doesn’t suck

Albert points at an OLD LADY who is shopping for nylons

ALBERT (CONTD)
Youve had that moment right

OLD LADY
You betcha

He turns to a woman pushing a DOUBLE STROLLER

ALBERT
You’ve had it at least twice
(back to the crowd)
We have to trust that miracles are
possible We have to believe it in
our hearts

Albert climbs down and reads the salesgirl’s name tag

ALBERT (CONTD)
How about youCarolyn

SALESGIRL
No The good ones are taken
ALBERT
Say it My moment will come
SALESGIRL
My momentwill come
(to Kat)

You’re very lucky

Kat nods a dazed “thank you” Albert grabs a PEN and starts
scribbling furiously on a piece of paper

ALBERT
Wonderful Now we need to put an
ensemble together for Kat and
were short on time So Carolyn
if you could be so kind pull these
items from the floor for us please

Albert slides over the sheet of paper It’s a page of
perfectly drawn BAR CODES Mystified the salesgirl grabs
her bar code scanner and waves it over the page

A LIST of ITEMS pop up on her screen

SALESGIRL
UhGive me a minute

Albert turns to Kat and Gabby with a grin

ALBERT
This is fun

INT AROUND THE MALL MONTAGE - DAY

As MUSIC PLAYS OVER the salesgirl brings a stack of boxes at
the register Albert hands over his credit card with a grin

INT MALL TATTOO PARLOR - DAY

A TATTOO ARTIST checks a picture of a heart with Kat’s name
in the middle then prepares to work on Albert’s shoulder

The tattoo needle descends but Albert’s shoulder BENDS IT

Kat and Gabby share a worried look Albert motions over to a
mini BLOW TORCH used for soldering jewelry The tattoo
artist shrugs Alright buddy it’s your arm

INT THE MALL FOYER - DAY

Neveah and Jaden walk through the mall with the other
football players and cheerleaders

NEVEAH
You can’t let this Albert guy just
stroll in and take over the school
Youre the alpha dog The pack
look to you for leadership

JADEN
What are you talking about

NEVEAH
I learned it on the Dog Whisperer
It’s science

A pair of grade school kids stop Jaden to sign their Glen
Hills football jerseys Neveah smiles - then notices a crowd
gathered across the way

ALBERT sits at the PIANO in front of Nordstrom’s pounding

out a tune with Kat at his side He finishes with a
flourish and the crowd goes nuts

EXT WASHINGTON DC - DAY - TO ESTABLISH

That we are cutting back to CIA Headquarters

INT CIA ROBOTICS LAB - DAY

McFee finds Hartley sitting in an empty lab in front of a

security monitor He watches grainy video of Albert emerging
from the assembly machine rewinding it again and again

HARTLEY
A healthy boyfour arms four
legs All his parts worked And I
never even got to see him

Hartley’s a little choked up McFee eyes him worried

MCFEE
You will Doctor But right now
you need to hold it together
because we’ve got some new
intelligence and it’s not good

INT A CIA SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Other than McFee Hartley and the lab techs the room is
filled with agents in dark suits It looks like a Mister
Anderson From The Matrix convention

MCFEE
We have 24 hours to handle this
situation as a CIA matter before
the Pentagon has to be notified

HARTLEY
The army doesn’t know Aren’t you
guys supposed to share information

The CIA agents chuckle McFee explains-—-

MCFEE

Forgive him He’s a civilian

(back to business)
Now if we don’t get the prototype
back this project will be shut
down forever But our problems go
deeper than that We have reason
to believe Black Sigma is involved

The screen behind McFee changes to a WORLD MAP Several
black Sigma symbols pop up in hot spots around the globe

HARTLEY
Black Sigma

MCFEE
That’s not a heavy metal band
It’s a terrorist group There’s no
modern military weapon they haven’t
tried to steal And they’ve set
their sights on the xX-17

HARTLEY
Are you saying these terrorists
have my prototype

Ivan the lab tech pipes up

IVAN
All we know is that they disabled
the network firewall They opened
a door - someone walked through it

AGENT JENKS
But wouldn’t they have needed an
entry point They need design
terminals that only we have

MCFEE
That’s right

FRITZ

That’s how we know Black Sigma
couldn’t have done this There was
one terminal at the Pentagon and
one here Black Sigma had no way
to get inside either one

Suddenly Hartley’s face goes ashen with realization

HARTLEY
Wait a minute There’s one more
entry terminal The beta version
that I designed

MCFEE
Where Is it well protected

HARTLEY
(guilty)
Wellwe have a “Stay Off the
Grass” sign out front

INT THE MALL’S FOOD COURT - AFTERNOON

KAT and GABBY walk through the mall triumphant carrying
half a dozen shopping bags Kat’s make-over is complete
Gone are the black rigs of emo eye shadow and the ratty hair

GABBY
You look amazing Exfoliated

KAT
More like exhausted Looking hot
is a lot of work

ACROSS THE FOOD COURT Albert is standing in line at Jamba
Juice - and he’s talking to NEVEAH Kat’s suddenly jealous

KAT (CONTD)
That mega-wench I’m going over--

GABBY
He’s programmed to be faithful

KAT
He may be the perfect guy But
he’s still a guy

NEVEAH AND ALBERT wait in line for their smoothies With
Albert Neveah is nothing but rainbow-flavored sweetness

NEVEAH
I’m the head of the School Spirit
committee so you know anything I
can do to make you feel welcome

ALBERT
Thanks

NEVEAH
Don’t rush into friendships with
the wrong crowd you know

Neveah twirls her hair even though Jaden’s looking on from a

nearby table Albert collects his smoothies

ALBERT
Thanks for the advice
KAT AND GABBY are watching this like angry hawks but Gabby’s
CELL PHONE RINGS She answers

GABBY
Hey Bart
INTERCUT WITH

INT HARTLEY’S OFFICE - SAME

Bart’s been working all day There are computer repair tools
and spare wires splayed out all around him

BART
I did it I rebooted the system

GABBY (ON PHONE)
Dude you’re a hero

BART
You mean I’m your hero
GABBY

Don’t push it
Bart gives his scrawny bicep a love peck

BART
I started with the partition resets
and did a manual rewrite of the C
drives When I brought it all back
together boom shaka laka

GABBY
I never would have thought of that

BART
Oh yes you would have

Gabby smiles One of those “I think I’m starting to like
this boy” kind of smiles

Then she notices a group of kids gathered around the window
of a nearby ELECTRONICS STORE

GABBY
Bart hold on a second

Gabby hangs up and wanders over close enough to see and hear
what’s on the wall of televisions

REPORTER (VO)
Details emerging from a high speed
chase in the early morning hours
near CIA Headquarters

Gabby stares at the image on ON THE TV SCREENS

It’s A RED FERRARI that’s being chased through the streets of
DC by police cars and military vehicles

REPORTER (VO)
The Ferrari was stolen after a
security breach The driver eluded
CIA and law enforcement for more
than half an hour - and then
disappeared

FROM A HELICOPTER VIEW we see the Ferrari turn into a wooded
neighborhood Multiple spotlights try in vain to find it

ANCHOR (VO)
Wow I haven’t seen driving like
that outside of a video game

REPORTER (VO)
The CIA had no comment on the
incident Trent But I think it’s
fair to say that the search for
this subject is still ongoing

GABBY stares at the screen biting her lip with new concern
She turns back to her phone again

GABBY
Bart can you pick us up from the
mall I think we lost our ride

Over at the FOOD COURT Kat cuddles with Albert oblivious
pinching his cheek as she sips her smoothie

Gabby’s not the only one who’s watching
ACROSS THE MALL Neveah still sitting with Jaden

NEVEAH
Why is he even with her It
doesn’t make sense

JADEN
Neither does your creepy obsession
with them

NEVEAH
Tell you one thing That dude sure
can throw a football

This gets Jaden’s attention

Meanwhile while Gabby’s off talking to Bart Kat and Albert
have their first moment alone in the real world

KAT
This day has beenamazing

ALBERT
Youre amazing Look at you

Kat smiles and shakes her head at Albert

KAT
It feels so weird to get a
compliment from a boy It’s like
watching a unicorn being born

ALBERT
Um You’re welcome

KAT
You know I was thinking I’ve
never kissed you for real

ALBERT
I was also thinking that

The words hang in the air for a moment Kat and Albert start
leaning towards each other

Everything else seems to melt away Kat closes her eyes
ready to have her world rocked--

JADEN (0S)
Hey Banks

KAT turns to find JADEN standing arms crossed surrounded by
his imposing offensive line

KAT
Aw man Jock-blocked

Neveah stands off to the side smirking

ALBERT
Jaden Facebook friend ninety two
How are ya

JADEN
I hear you’re telling everyone that
you deserve to be quarterback

ALBERT
I’m sorry who what-what now

One of Jaden’s not-so-bright linemen TONY speaks up

TONY
First day in school and you think
youre like the man

POV INSIDE ALBERT’S HEAD - we’re looking at Jaden with a
computer screen SUPERIMPOSED over the view Albert scrolls
through a readout of every word he’s ever said

ALBERT
I don’t recall saying that

NEVEAH

What he actually said was “When

I’m quarterback Jaden will look

good in a cheer outfit”

Gabby approaches as Albert tries to defuse the situation

ALBERT

Hey everybody why don’t we all

chill out Tell you what - you

guys head for the wiener shack

well head for Build a Bear

TONY
How about you just shut your--

IN A FLASH Albert grabs Tony’s cheeks and pinches them

ALBERT
Wouldn’t say that if I were you

TONY
MMFFFPPHH

Jaden steps in but Albert clamps Jaden’s mouth shut too

ALBERT
No no honeychild No

With a rush Neveah SHOVES Albert from behind and that is
enough to set off a MELEE

The jocks start lunging and Albert grabs them one by one
FLINGING them across the mall’s tiled floor

Jaden swings wildly Albert takes him in a headlock

Some kids gather around egging on the carnage Others run
for the exits

Someone pulls a FIRE ALARM

Gabby and Kat look on in abject terror when they spot a pair
of MALL COPS coming up the escalator

KAT
Albert

Albert turns momentarily distracted and Jaden shoves him

JADEN
Get off me

Jaden’s push knocks Albert off balance

Albert slips on the puddle of smoothie on the tile floor
pitches forward and goes OVER THE RAILING--
Kat and Gabby rush forward watching in horror

ALBERT FALLS THREE STORIES falling through balloons and
banners and landing with a distant THUNK

KAT
You jerk You broke him

JADEN
I-- I’m sorry

MALL COP (0OS)
Hey

The MALL COPS approach Kids SCATTER in all directions
Gabby tried to pull Kat towards the exits

KAT
I’m not leaving him

GABBY
Kat We have to get out of here

Halfway to the escalators Kat stops and comes back She
grabs her bag of new clothes then heads downstairs again

Gabby shakes her head and joins the rush for the exits

EXT THE MALL - SAME

A POLICE CAR SCREECHES UP sirens whooping as Gabby fights
her way outside The cops run inside just as

BART’S CADDY rumbles into view Gabby hops in it and slams
the door Bart tries to be nonchalant

BART
Fancy meeting you h--

GABBY
You saved my butt Don’t ruin it
by saying anything
INT THE MALL - SAME

It’s still pandemonium inside The fire alarm keeps WAILING

Kat rides the DOWN escalator - the shoppers pass her in
hordes in the other direction

Kat reaches the bottom floor rushing to the spot where
Albert landed--

And he’s NOWHERE TO BE SEEN There’s just a boy-sized dent
in the floor from his fall

The MALL COPS are descending on the escalator
Kat is about to turn to run when

ALBERT pulls her sideways and out of sight into one of those
curtained INSTANT PHOTO BOOTHS

The mall cops run by as the photo bulb FLASHES in the booth
INSIDE THE BOOTH

Albert hands Kat the fresh strip of photos they show Albert
smiling at the camera and Kat in shock

ALBERT
Aw Look at us

INT AN ABANDONED FOOT LOCKER - MINUTES LATER
The fire alarm has emptied the store of people
Kat and Albert walk through the aisles of shoes

KAT
This is crazy All I wanted was a
smoothie it turns into a stupid
fight Why do guys do that

ALBERT
It’s good to be sensitive But
sometimes you have to hulk-smash
the haters

Kat looks at Albert with new fascination she helped create
him but he’s still a boy - that strange species that she
doesn’t quite understand

Albert finds a FIRE ALARM and pulls it all the way off the
wall He reaches into the wiring - and the alarm STOPS

INT EMPTY BATH and BODY STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Kat follows Albert into another deserted store He walks
past the displays and the registers towards the back room

KAT
We should get out of here We’re
going to get in trouble

ALBERT
No one will get in trouble if they
can’t prove the fight happened

IN THE STOCK ROOM Albert puts his hand against the concrete
feeling for something

INSIDE ALBERT’S HEAD the command “ENGAGE MAGNETIC FIELD”

Albert holds up his hand a STAPLER flies through the air
sticks to it magnetized

ON KAT watching Albert exerting his super-human power For
the first time there’s a different look in her eyes

FEAR

Albert moves his hand and the FILE CABINET a few feet away
starts to DRAG TOWARDS HIM

INT THE MALL SECURITY ROOM - SAME

A handful of mall cops stare at a wall of CLOSED CIRCUIT TVs

They’re in the midst of rewinding to look at the beginning of
the food court fight again

And suddenly the screens begin to flicker

INTERCUT WITH

INT STOCK ROOM - SAME
Albert flattens his magnetized hands against the bricks

The mall security monitors go BLACK as the contents of their
hard drives get erased in an instant

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

ALBERT
That should do it

Albert turns grinning proudly to find that Kat’s GONE

INT OUT IN THE EMPTY MALL - SAME

Kat’s walking quickly across the mall’s wide foyer Albert
catches up to her in front of an indoor fountain

ALBERT
Kat Hey What’s wrong

Kat wheels around freaked out

KAT
Look I know we designed you But
we didn’t design that

ALBERT
I have bonus features Like a DVD

KAT
It’s not funny Albert How did
you just do that What are you

Albert stares at the floor

ALBERT
Every relationship needs a little
mystery right

Kat stares at him not giving in until Albert shrugs

ALBERT (CONTD)
It’sclassified

KAT
I don’t know what’s going on I
feel like I’m in over my head

ALBERT
We both are It always feels this
way when you fall for someone

KAT
No Not like this

ALBERT
I can’t tell you everything But I
promise - I will always keep you
safe and you are the only thing in
this world that matters to me

KAT
I don’t know what I’m doing I’m
scared

ALBERT
That’s how you’re supposed to feel
right before something amazing
happens

Albert leans in - and finally - in real life--

KISSES KAT for the first time

Now this is something Gabby and Kat did design Albert to do
And if there’s such a thing as a perfect romantic make-you-

weak-at-the-knees kiss this is it

Albert pulls away After a moment Kat opens her eyes

KAT

I think I need to go sit down
ALBERT

Alright
KAT

In your car

ALBERT
That’s fine

KAT
And do that again

Albert turns to Kat surprised

FROM INSIDE ALBERT’S HEAD looking at Kat we see an alert
appear WARNING REDUCE HEAT SYSTEM IS RUNNING HOT

EXT THE HARTLEY HOME - AFTERNOON

Bart’s Cadillac is parked in front of the house

INT HARTLEY’S OFFICE - SAME

Bart and Gabby sit at Hartley’s now-functioning computer
Gabby’s back at the keyboard typing away again

BART
You know I went to all the trouble
of fixing this the least you could
do is not break it again

GABBY
Girls always go online to check out
their bestie’s new crush

BART
On a high security encrypted
network I meanwhat’s the deal
here

GABBY
I might have built your sister a
cyborg boyfriend But I didn’t
mean for it to go this far He was
supposed to be virtual

BART
Well he’s extremely virtual

Gabby furiously types commands Suddenly the screen goes red
and fills with the following WARNING

WARNING WARNING WARNING

YOU ARE TRESPASSING ON A PRIVATE NETWORK
OF THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF
DEFENSE VIOLATORS ARE SUBJECT TO
FEDERAL PROSECUTION
BART (CONTD)
See now this is the moment where
you’re supposed to stop
Gabby keeps typing She pulls up an index of FILES
GABBY
Look PROTOTYPE MANUAL That
should tell us something--
She pulls out a key drive and plugs it in the computer
As the file starts to DOWNLOAD--
We hear the front door OPENING

Footsteps approach out in the hallway and the office security
keypad begins to BEEP

BART
Crap It’s my dad

Panic time Bart and Gabby PILE INTO THE CLOSET

Gabby stares through the KEYHOLE as a CONTROLLED EXPLOSIVE
blasts a hole through the dead bolt

GABBY
Mmm don’t think so

The door is KICKED AWAY Three men in black fatigues enter

They speak IN RUSSIAN ACCENTS and have GUNS tucked into their
waistbands

Their leader is a scowling bald man named SASHA He has a
Greek letter SIGMA tattooed on his arm

He walks right to Hartley’s computer and types commands until
ALBERT’S IMAGE fills the screen
SASHA
There he is The prototype What

a cute toy

Gabby peeks in the keyhole Her KEY DRIVE is still in the
computer

SASHA (CONTD)
Take the files Take it all

The two others start rifling through Hartley’s files and
dismantling his computer

Bart looks through the keyhole going ballistic

BART
Come on I just fixed that

Gabby shushes Bart but Sasha and the others stop what
they’re doing as if they’ve heard something

Bart and Gabby shrink backwards in the closet

THROUGH THE KEYHOLE we see Sasha turning staring at the
closet door But then something else grabs his attention--

He gives a silent signal and the intruders pack up what they
have and go They PRY UP A WINDOW and slip out

Bart and Gabby emerge from the closet They peek through the
curtains as SIX BLACK SUVs PULL UP outside Hartley McFee
and a dozen CIA agents step out

Bart turns to Gabby incredulous
BART (CONTD)

What is happening This is the
suburbs

EXT THE MALL PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Things have returned to normal at the mall Shoppers walking
in and out

Albert and Kat walk through the rows of cars hand in hand
Kat still has that dreamy post make-out look

KAT
Give me another kiss Justa
widdle bitty one

ALBERT
I would but that woman is staring
at us

Kat looks up in shock at her MOTHER Peggy is standing by
her Volvo holding a shopping bag of her own

PEGGY
Katrina

KAT
Mom What are you doing here

PEGGY
I need new panty hose And I
thought you were studying at
Gabby’s

KAT
I was just--

PEGGY
Lying I get that now I take it
this is the boy who called last
night at midnight

ALBERT
(iber-polite)
Pleasure to meet you ma’am I’m
Albert Katrinas boyfriend

Peggy’s eyebrows go up at the word “boyfriend”

KAT
He’sfrom Alaska

ALBERT
Perhaps you’ve seen it on those
shows about ice fishermen

PEGGY
Katrina are you wearing mascara
And what in the world did you buy

KAT
Oh Um Albert asked me to
Homecoming and you know he said I
need to look really hot

PEGGY
Did he

Kat puts her head down This is going poorly

ALBERT
Okay Well nice to meet you--

PEGGY
Hop in the car 111 give both of
you a ride home I’d very much
like to meet your parents

ALBERT
I have my own--

Albert glances across the parking lot
TWO STATE TROOPERS are standing next to the Ferrari

ALBERT (CONTD)
Great Sounds great

Kat and Albert climb into Peggy’s Volvo

INT THE HARTLEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON

CIA agents are everywhere McFee’s in the ransacked office
He’s on his cell phone doing damage control

MCFEE
The terminal has been compromised
but they couldn’t have gotten far
I want air support and a dedicated
satcom channel

Hartley and Agent Jenks head up the stairs
HARTLEY
Bart’s car is outside He must

have been here when they--

Jenks holds up a hand partially to silence him partly to
calm him down She calls out

AGENT JENKS
Hello Anyone home

There’s no answer Hartley looks sick with worry Agent
Jenks pulls back her coat to put a hand on her GUN

They reach the top of stairs and the first bedroom door
Hartley takes a deep breath and throws it open revealing

BART AND GABBY MAKING OUT ON THE BED They jump apart
straightening their clothes--

BART
Dad Jeez

HARTLEY
(embarrassed)
Sorry I’m Sorry

GABBY
We were juststudying

AGENT JENKS
Sorry to interrupt you two There
was a break-in downstairs You
didn’t happen to hear anything

BART
No We’ve been studying Really
hard

HARTLEY

Not too hard I hope
Bart walks over to his dad speaking in a whisper

BART
All that stuff you told me about
girls Worked like a charm

Hartley nods vaguely He has no memory of it Bart offers
him a bro-like fist bump

BART (CONTD)
Mack Daddy Bump it Explode it
Shower the world with your light

Bart wiggles his fingers like fading fireworks Agent Jenks
suppresses a smile but then she’s back to business

AGENT JENKS
Do you mind if I look around

HARTLEY
This is Miss Jenks My co-worker
from the video game company
GABBY

Someone breaking in to steal a
video game I guess those Nintendo
jerks will stop at nothing

HARTLEY
Bart I think it would be safer if
you take Gabby home

Hartley and Jenks close the door Gabby quickly JUMPS AWAY
from Bart and wipes off her mouth

BART
I think they bought it

GABBY
They better have What’d you have
for lunch tuna fish Just so
were clear that was strictly
tactical and I still have a
boyfriend

BART
Okay But do you love me a little

He holds up the KEY DRIVE with Albert’s MANUAL on it

INT PEGGY’S VOLVO - DAY

Kat and Albert sit quietly in the back of Peggy’s car Peggy
looks in the rear view mirror watching them like a hawk

PEGGY
So when were you planning on
introducing me Katrina

Kat starts to object but Albert steps in warmly

ALBERT
She’s right Kat The lack of
communication between generations
is one of the great challenges
facing our society today

Peggy’s impressed by this she takes a closer look at Albert
in the rear view mirror

ALBERT (CONTD)
We’re all so connected “Hello” or
“I Love You” is only a text away
But somehow we’re more isolated
than ever People say they’re
busy But I think that’s an
excuse I think we use technology
as a place to hide

PEGGY
I keep telling my students the same
thing I did my PhD in
technological anthropology

As Peggy goes on inspired A BLACK SEDAN pulls up next to
them Albert looks over and locks eyes with

SASHA The leader of Black Sigma

He recognizes Albert Albert immediately senses something is
off with Sasha too

POV INSIDE ALBERT’S HEAD

Albert’s vision goes into X-RAY SCAN MODE We see that Sasha
and his two passengers are all carrying FIREARMS

The light turns Sasha’s car FOLLOWS THEM and Albert notices

ALBERT
Mrs Hartley I’m sorry I just
remembered I’m supposed to meet
my friends at the football game

PEGGY
Tonight’s the homecoming game Oh
KatYou guys should go

Kat’s thinking back to the fight at the mall The football
game seems like an extremely bad idea

KAT
I thought we were in trouble

PEGGY
Nonsense I trust you guys

Peggy turns to Kat She covertly points at Albert and
whispers excited

PEGGY (CONTD)
I like him

EXT GLEN HILLS HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT

The Glen Hills football team takes the field to a DEAFENING
ROAR from the crowd Jaden leads the charge

The BLEACHERS are shaking filled with students and alumni
decked out in Glen Hills colors

JADEN throws warm-up passes to his wide receivers as his
teammates butt helmets to psych each other up

Kat and Albert walk through the milling students arm and arm
The electricity in the air is palpable it’s the see-and-be-
seen event of the school year

Kat’s on her phone

KAT
It’s crazy here This is like the
Oscars for having a boyfriend

INTERCUT WITH GABBY who’s riding over in Bart’s car

GABBY
The football game Seriously Kat
could there be a worse idea

Kat and Albert pass the CHEERLEADERS as they dance in front
of the crowd with all their hip-shaking might

As she leads the squad NEVEAH sees Kat walking by with
Albert and nearly trips in mid-Herkie

GABBY (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
I need to talk to you about Albert

KAT
(covering the phone)
Me too We totes made out and it
was amaze-balls See you soon
We’ll save seats

We stay with BART AND GABBY after Kat hangs up
BART
She’s going to be cool with giving

him back right

GABBY
Absolutely

EXT THE FOOTBALL GAME - SAME

Kat and Albert walk towards the bleachers All the other
kids are saying hi They’re popular now--

But Albert’s distracted He looks over his shoulder and sees
SASHA and his men following them twenty paces behind

Albert looks for a safe place and pulls Kat

UNDER THE BLEACHERS It’s a strangely magical place
Slivers of light soda cups and kissing couples

KAT
What are you doing

ALBERT
I’m trying to figure out what’s
going on

KAT

It’s pretty easy I think we just
kind of stand here and make out

Kat leans in for a kiss but Albert’s still on the lookout

ALBERT
I’m sorry It’s not about you

KAT
Really I thought it was always
about me

Just then something catches Alberts eye

ALBERT
Coach Coach Voss

REVEAL COACH VOSS who’s hiding in the shadows under the
grandstands nursing a bottle in a crumpled paper bag

ALBERT (CONTD)
Shouldn’t you be out there

The Coach points at the field with a bitter look

COACH VOSS
Rivalries I hate ‘em How can
they expect us to win this Do you
know how long it’s been since we’ve
beaten Uni High Do you Do--
(recognizing Albert)
You Alaska

ALBERT
It’s Albert sir

COACH VOSS
What size helmet are you

SASHA appears at the far end of the bleachers He locks eyes
with Albert Albert senses danger and turns to Kat-—-

ALBERT
Look I need to be on that field
Ill be safe there

KAT
Football doesn’t work like that

But it’s too late - Albert out toward the football field

INT BART’S CAR - SAME
Bart’s rusty Cadillac careens towards the high school

Gabby has her nose pressed to her iPhone reading the fine
print of Albert’s instruction manual

GABBY

He has a titanium skeleton A
hundred terabytes of static memory
He can microwave things with his
feet Why would he even need that

BART

Do you think we should have-- you
know Told my dad I mean those
guys who broke in were like
terrorists right

GABBY
It wasn’t Orkin pest patrol Look
I got us into this I should set
things right
(with a sigh)
I’ve learned an important lesson
Never ever set up your best friend

CLANK COUGH The Caddy’s engine dies The car rolls to a
stop with the football stadium still in the distance

GABBY (CONTD)
Are you serious

BART
I hope you wore comfortable shoes

EXT GLEN HILLS FOOTBALL FIELD - SAME

The scoreboard shows that Glen Hills is getting killed by Uni
High 21-0 The already beleaguered offense takes the field

Suddenly a ROAR goes up from the crowd

KAT stands up on the packed bleachers straining to watch as
ALBERT RUNS OUT ONTO THE FIELD to join the huddle

Jaden can’t believe his eyes

JADEN
What the--

ALBERT
Look this wasn’t my idea

JADEN
You fell three stories How are
you even alive

Jaden signals for TIME OUT and walks over to the sidelines

COACH VOSS
What

JADEN
You can’t put him in

COACH VOSS
I just did

JADEN

But he’s never even practiced

NEVEAH
Yeah He’s never even practiced

Coach Voss and Jaden realizing that for some reason NEVEAH
has joined their little huddle

COACH VOSS
Excuse me Who put you in charge

NEVEAH
I’m a cheerleader It’s right
there in the name

Coach Voss stares at her slack-jawed Meanwhile

GABBY AND BART arrive at the edge of the field out of
breath

Gabby is still reading the Prototype Manual off her phone

GABBY
Oh my God Look at this Section
c line 9

Gabby shoves her phone in Bart’s face as they push through
the grandstands trying to find Kat

BART
(reading)
“Two separate codes must be entered
to activate weapons capability”
(he looks up)
Weapons Like weapons weapons

KAT spots them from the stands and waves them up

KAT
Hey guys

Kat slides over to make space as they arrive

KAT (CONTD)
Did you see Albert’s going in

BART
Yeah That’samazing

KAT
Isn’t he just the bomb

Off Gabby and Bart’s reaction we cut back to--

THE FIELD Where Albert huddles with the rest of the team
Pretty much every guy from the mall brawl stares back at him

ALBERT
What’s up fellas

Nothing but icy stares Jaden calls a play
JADEN
Blue Nine Right Zebra on three
BREAK

The players clap and break huddle Albert stands up and
claps a second late As Jaden gets over center Albert asks--

ALBERT
So what do I do

JADEN
Stay out of the way

Across the line of scrimmage the Uni linebackers SNARL

UNI LINEBACKER
You guys are worse than last year

JADEN
Twenty three Twenty three HUTT

Jaden hikes the ball and the Uni defense EATS THE GLEN VIEW
OFFENSIVE LINE ALIVE

They barrel through the line sacking Jaden BRUTALLY

The ball POPS out - FUMBLE

The crowd GASPS but Albert instinctively falls on the ball--
And gets instantly buried in a DOG PILE of players

IN THE STANDS Gabby and Bart WINCE hands over their eyes--

GABBY
Oh god oh god oh god--

ON THE SIDELINES Neveah screams into her cheer horn--

NEVEAH
Kill him

The other cheerleaders look at her mortified
BACK ON THE FIELD after a long moment of tension
ALBERT emerges from the bottom of the pile

HE HOLDS THE BALL ALOFT

The crowd comes alive Finally something is going Glen
Hills’ way

Jaden huddles the team up again

JADEN
Let’s try um red left forty two--

TONY the beefy lineman from the mall points at Albert

TONY
J man how about we just give it
to him

JADEN

We can’t just--

ALBERT
Good plan Break

The players clap and break huddle Jaden walks to the line
miffed

JADEN
FourteenWhateverHUTT

Jaden turns and in a FLASH Albert grabs the ball and is OFF
FROM ALBERT’S POV the game seems to SLOW DOWN

Uni’s linebackers come at him with enough force to tackle
Adrian Peterson but they bounce off in a heap

Albert runs over EVERYONE including a couple of his own
players and prances into the end zone

After a moment of shocked disbelief The Glen Hills crowd
EXPLODES into cheers

COACH VOSS grabs his nearest assistant coach and kisses him
Albert points into the stands and blows Kat a kiss

KAT
I love you

GABBY
(whispered to Bart)
Did she just say--

BART
That is what she said

The KID in the stands next to Bart claps excited

KAT
He’s like our secret weapon

BART
You have no idea
INT THE PARKING LOT OF THE FOOTBALL FIELD - SAME
As laughing kids walk by on their way to the game
SASHA and his two minions VLAD AND ALEXI open the trunk of

their car They check their weapons he looks up at the
distant scoreboard The hometown crowd ROARS again

SASHA
Such a violent game So American
They cannot be trusted with the
weapon

VLAD
But why do they bring the it to
this place Maybe it’s a trap

SASHA
No This is our chance

Sasha removes a DEVICE from the car’s trunk it’s the size
of a sub-machine gun with a SILVER SPHERE on the end

SASHA (CONTD)
Electro-pulse gun It shuts down
anything electrical for 60 seconds
Enough time to plant this

Sasha pulls out a TINY SPIDER SHAPED DEVICE that features a
data-input prong and a blinking transmitter

SASHA (CONT’D)
He seems to answer only to the
girl This will change his mind

suspect is Sasha Bazim Black

HARTLEY
That’s it We have to go public
with this-- Find him

MCFEE

Pentagon will shut it down and deny
it ever existed All your work
will be for nothing

HARTLEY
We have no leads We have nothing

FRITZ
Maybe not

McFee and Hartley turn to the monitors Fritz takes off his
headphones and hits REWIND on the main screen

FRITZ (CONTD)

Satellite tracking picked up an
unusual burst of energy two miles
from here at the high school

This video of the football game was
just posted online

The monitor lights up with video of ALBERT scoring his
touchdown

FRITZ (CONTD)
Watch it again

Fritz plays the video again in SLOW MOTION

Albert runs past defenders by JUMPING IN THE AIR AND THEN
IMPOSSIBLY MOVING SIDEWAYS with a small burst of light

AGENT JENKS
Wow Kid’s got hops

MCFEE
That’s the X-17’s levitation
function

CLOSE UP ON HARTLEY as all trace of doubt slips away

HARTLEY
That’s him That’s my prototype

BEHIND HARTLEY PEGGY walks in the front door loaded down
with shopping bags She leans in to say hi and notices
Albert’s frozen image on the monitor

Hartley stares at her aghast Peggy pats him on the
shoulder

Now Jim Don’t worry He’s
actually a very nice boy

EXT GLEN HILLS FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

Halftime is over and The Glen Hills High team runs out of
the locker room onto the field newly confident Jaden and
Albert jog out in front

As they exit the tunnel from the locker room Albert sees
Kat runs over and lifts her up in a bear hug

KAT
You were amazing

Jaden spots Neveah and a look of dread comes over him

JADEN
Hey

NEVEAH
Don’t “hey” me How can you let
them do this to us

JADEN
Do what

NEVEAH
Weve lived here our whole lives
This is our school That Albert

Jaden and most of the team run off with Neveah in tow

The last few players straggle out of the tunnel These guys
clearly aren’t in the starting lineup

SASHA and the other two Black Sigma Ops step in their way

SASHA
Go team Play hard and win

STRAGGLING PLAYER
Thanks but we don’t really play

SASHA
Good Then no one will notice you

Colonel McFee and Doctor Hartley look down on the action

MCFEE
Nothing like a search and capture

Gabby can’t keep her concern quiet anymore

GABBY

be dangerous

KAT

Coach Voss yells out the next play then looks to his left
noticing

SASHA VLAD and ALEXI They are now dressed (a little
awkwardly) in Glen Hills Football uniforms

COACH VOSS
Who are you

SASHA

Coach Voss frowns but gets distracted by the game--

COACH VOSS
Hey-- Go Jaden Go Run

ON FIELD Jaden cradles the ball dodging a defender He
slows at the twenty yard line deciding which way to go

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL ALBERT

Blocking aside defensive players like he’s swatting flies
Jaden shrugs and strolls into the end zone

Pandemonium in the stands
The scoreboard reads GLEN HILLS 35 UNI HIGH 38
IN THE BLEACHERS Kat punches Gabby on the shoulder

KAT
This is so exciting

Gabby looks up at the HELICOPTER again then at the
BLACK SUVs that roll onto the grass behind the end zone
CIA agents and SWAT team guys pour out

GABBY
Yep Gonna be a big finish

Bart looks over the railing of the bleachers

THE THREE BENCH-WARMING FOOTBALL PLAYERS are running towards
the field from the locker room

They’re stripped down to their undies pointing at the field--

ALEXI AND VLAD the Black Sigma henchmen are among them

Back on the sidelines Sasha pulls the Electro-Pulse gun out
of an equipment bag and crouches into firing position but no

Two of the players try to pull Albert out of the pile

PLAYER
Give him room Give him room

A CLOSE UP REVEALS they are ALEXI AND VLAD the Black Sigmas
Jenks and the other CIA agents join the chaos--

IN THE CROWD SASHA raises the electro-pulse device and
pulls the trigger

A SHOCK WAVE OF ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ENERGY shakes the stadium

The floodlights and scoreboard plunge into DARKNESS

Even the swaying lights of smart phones in the stands blink
out one by one

horror as the field below them goes DARK

FROM ALBERT’S POV - He spots Kat-—-
But his vision flickers bursts with static and goes DARK--
His voice does that creepy slow thing like HAL in 2001-

ALBERT
K--AAAA---TTTT

Albert PASSES OUT right into VLAD AND ALEXI’S ARMS

SASHA is at his side quick as a cat kneeling over the
unconscious Albert

He pulls out THE TINY HACKING DEVICE and turns Albert’s
helmet pressing it in behind his right ear It DRILLS down
flush with his skin

KAT AND GABBY push through the circle of celebrating players
They spot the Black Sigma guys hunched over Albert

KAT
Hey

CIA AGENTS barrel towards them

You’re ours now baby

In the darkness a red REBOOT light appears on screen
WE ARE INSIDE ALBERT’S HEAD AGAIN

His processor begins to spin “HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT MOVING
NW AT 39 MPH” “WEAPONS SYSTEMS ON STANDBY”

VOICE (VO)
Don’t try to fight it We own you

Albert’s vision begins to clear in the darkness he makes
out the shapes of imposing figures surrounding him until--

TONY the beefy linebacker leans clearly into frame

TONY
Welcome to the team bra

Albert BOLTS UPRIGHT inside a VAN surrounded by the same
players who tried to beat him up at the mall

They hoot holler and clap him on the back

ALBERT
Where are we Where are we going

TONY
The after party

More raucous celebration from the other players

ALBERT
(still groggy)
Where’s Kat

TONY
Relax Al we texted her It’s
party time We beat UNI

More hoots of triumph Albert looks out the window
helplessly as the van speeds deep into the countryside

INT THE BLACK SIGMA OPS’ CAR - MINUTES LATER

Bart drives farther back on the country road Gabby and Kat
sit in the back seat

A car full of KIDS passes them HONKING AND SCREAMING
Kat checks the directions on her phone

KAT
Says here we go left up ahead
(an excited sigh)
Our first after-party you guys
Whos excited

Gabby turns to Kat with frustration

GABBY
Kat Listen to me okay This
can’t go any further You have to
shut Albert down

KAT
Why are you being so aggro

GABBY
We’re in a terrorist’s car being
chased by the government and your
dad Sorry if I’m not chillaxing
What was Albert even doing in that
game He could have hurt someone

KAT
Our relationship isn’t like that
I don’t order him around Albert
is his own man

GABBY
No Kat No he’s not He’s your
responsibility You control him

KAT
Don’t tell me how to handle my man

Bart shakes his head as he makes the left turn--
BART
Am I on the Jerry Springer show
EXT THE AFTER PARTY - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH
A HUGE MANSION in the affluent Virginia suburbs

Someone’s parents are out of town and let’s hope they have
insurance

Albert and the other football players tumble out of their van
and are given a hero’s welcome by the partiers

Albert looks around trying to get his bearings
Behind his ear the HACKING DEVICE blinks

INSIDE ALBERT’S POV - a message flashes “REMOTE ACCESS
ATTEMPT REQUESTING COMMAND CONTROL”

TONY
Dude this place is sick

ALBERT
All these people are in danger I
need to warn them

EXT BACKYARD POOL - CONTINUOUS

The backyard is packed with even more teenagers partying
around the pool

Albert gets up on the SWIMMING BOARD The kids see him and
start to chant for their football hero

PARTYING KIDS
A1l-BERT A1-BERT AL-BERT

ALBERT
Please everyone Listen

The deejay turns down the music Albert tries to find the
words to alert everyone to the danger He tries the truth

ALBERT (CONTD)
Look I appreciate all of you
accepting me into the school But
I’m not a person I’m a machine

The partygoers raise their glasses and CHEER

TONY
Yeah bro You’re a MACHINE

ALBERT
No -- you all need to leave because
it’s about to get dangerous here

Everyone ROARS THEIR AGREEMENT Albert gets more frustrated

ALBERT (CONTD)
I’m trying to help you Please
I’m a superbomb - the kind of
weapon the world has never seen
before -- and if I go off -- you
better grab the person closest to

you and get down

On the words “Get Down” the Deejay DROPS THE BEAT and
everyone SCREAMS and DANCES like there’s no tomorrow

Albert shakes his head - this is useless And then he grabs
his forehead as if he’s in pain

CLOSE ON THE BLACK SIGMA HACKING DEVICE still working away
and still transmitting a remote signal

INT ANOTHER CAR FULL OF TEENAGERS - NIGHT

Somewhere on the country road to the party This car’s a
Prius packed with giggling pom-pom girls and

SASHA He’s squashed in the back and looking down at his
tracking device In his clipped Russian English he says

SASHA
Turn next left please

POM POM GIRL
So psyched Omigod I never get
invited to these parties

2ND POM POM GIRL
What position do you play

SASHA
Umcatcher Footballcatcher

2ND POM POM GIRL
Rad I love sports

EXT THE AFTER PARTY MANSION - NIGHT

Bart parks the Black Sigma’s sedan outside the massive after-
party Gabby and Kat climb out still arguing

GABBY
Kat listen to me There are
terrorists after Albert The only
homecoming he should be going to is
at the Pentagon

Kat checks her make-up in her phone and Gabby follows her

KAT
You know Gabs I don’t want to be
harsh and I’m saying this as a
friend but I think maybe you’re a
little jealous of me

GABBY
What

KAT
Look I get it Albert’s amazing
We’re amazing together I don’t
blame you for wishing it was you

GABBY
You’ve got to be kidding

KAT
Reading his manual cover-to-cover
Hello Obsess much Now excuse
me I have to find my boyfriend

Kat walks up the steps Gabby and Bart watch her go
GABBY
Unreal I’ve created a monster
EXT GAS STATION PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The CIA Chopper is grounded to refuel and the feds have
circled the wagons to regroup

JENKS debriefs McFee and Hartley She motions to ALEXI AND
VLAD who are handcuffed in the back of her car

AGENT JENKS
They claim they attached a hacking
device to Albert’s CPU If it
cracks his security code Black
Sigma will control the weapon

HARTLEY
I’m more worried about the weapon
cracking my daughter’s defenses

MCFEE
Hey - take it easy Dad As far as
we know Kat still has command
control Let’s hope she’s more
stable than you are

McFee turns to address someone OFF SCREEN

MCFEE (CONTD)
Gentlemen I understand you’re
privy to some classified
information So as a service to
your country please tell us
where is the after party

REVERSE ANGLE ON THREE HIGH SCHOOL STONERS sitting on the
curb outside a convenience store

STONER
Sure I could tell you But then
Id have to kill you

The stoners bust up laughing Hartley glares at McFee - we
are so screwed

INT THE AFTER PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Kat walks through the party now getting hugs and air kisses
from people she doesn’t even know

She spots Albert across the room She waves sweetly but
he’s distracted

CLOSE UP AGAIN on the hacking device behind Albert’s ear--

INSIDE ALBERT’S HEAD - numbered code combinations whir by -
each one is DENIED but the persistent bug keeps trying

KAT
Albert Honey Are you okay

ALBERT
No I feel likesomeone’s trying
to mess with my head

KAT

Tell me about it Gabby is being a
total nightmare right now

EXT THE DRIVEWAY OUTSIDE THE PARTY - SAME

Somewhere along the row of cars parked haphazardly down the
mansion’s driveway

SASHA has broken into the trunk of his own car The football
uniform is gone and he’s changed into street clothes

He pulls out a 9mm pistol checks that it’s loaded and
sticks it in his belt

He slams the trunk - a look of violent purpose in his eyes

INT THE PARTY - SAME
Kat’s basking in the post-football game glory

KAT
Do you think they’1l give you a
letterman’s jacket I want to wear
it in school and feel all like
comfy and validated

Albert leans against her rubbing his head
ALBERT

I don’t feel so well Maybe we
should go

KAT
But honey This is the coolest
party I’ve ever been invited to

Kat’s blood goes cold when she hears the voice behind her

NEVEAH (0S)
It’s the only party you’ve ever
been to and you weren’t invited

Kat and Albert turn to see NEVEAH AND JADEN
NEVEAH (CONTD)
You two just keep showing up where
you don’t belong

KAT
It’s your house Of course it had
to be your house

Jaden looks more embarrassed of Neveah than ever

JADEN
Albert won the game for us Nev
Maybe like chill out for once

NEVEAH
You keep your beautiful mouth shut

KAT
Were staying Come on Albert
As Kat grabs Albert by the hand and leads him off through the
party Neveah sees something troubling off screen--

NEVEAH

Hey

ANGLE ON SASHA attempting to slip inside Neveah’s house via
Caught he starts to reach for his weapon

a side door
NEVEAH (CONTD)

If you’re using the inside
bathroom take off your muddy shoes

or Ill kill you
Neveah turns

Sasha nods politely and slips his shoes off
back to the party in a huff

NEVEAH

I mean seriously
people raised by wolves

(CONT’D)
Were these

INT NEVEAH’S ROOM - NIGHT

Kat pulls Albert into an empty room upstairs It’s an
explosion of pink plaid wallpaper and cheer camp trophies

KAT
Ugh I feel like I haven’t been
alone with you for like years

Albert’s still pre-occupied He opens Neveah’s balcony door
and scans the party

ALBERT
We have to talk

Kat flops back on the bed in frustration--

KAT
I know we programmed you to be
sensitive but dude

EXT THE AFTER PARTY - NIGHT

Gabby and Bart walk through the party looking for Albert or
a terrorist Or both

BART
I always wanted to go to a party
like this before I died I think I
got it in just under the wire
(his CELL PHONE RINGS)
Andthere’s my dad

Bart looks at Gabby She nods answer it
BART (CONTD)
(casual)

Hey Pops What’s up

INTERCUT WITH

INT MCFEE’S HUMVEE - SAME

The caravan of CIA Humvees is finally on the road to the
party Hartley rides with McFee

HARTLEY
Bart Are you at the after party

Bart tries to cover the phone but there’s no way for him to
cover the shouting laughter and loud music

BART
Ummaybe

HARTLEY
Son do you know what Albert is

BART
Maybe And Dad - and let me just
say before you perma-ground me that
the fact that you invented him is
like super rad

Hartley feels McFee GLARING at him get to the point But
he can’t help but be touched by his son’s words

HARTLEY
It’s my life’s work son But you
and Katrina are my life I want
you safe I don’t want to punish
anyone for hacking my system

BART
Good Then you should probably
talk to the person who did it
Bart hands the phone to Gabby She takes it sheepish--

GABBY
Hi Doctor Hartley

Off Hartley’s surprised reaction we go back to--

INT NEVEAH’S ROOM - SAME

Albert holds Kat’s hand For the first time he’s struggling
to express himself like a genuine teenage boy

ALBERT
I don’t know how to tell you this --
there’ssomeone else

IN ALBERT’S HEAD The hacking device continues to try ACCESS
CODES while disabling Albert’s other functions

ALBERT (CONT’D)
Someone else wants me

KAT
I knew it

ALBERT
I -- I can’t control it I feel
like this person knows how I tick

Kat shakes her head in disgust She’s sure it’s Gabby

KAT
Looks like I need to find a new
best friend Of all the android
boyfriends in the world she had to
go after mine

EXT THE PARTY - SAME

Gabby and Bart sit in the midst of the party on her cell
phone We’re still INTERCUTTING with Hartley who’s riding
in the Humvee as it races down the road

GABBY
The hacking device must have
disabled Albert’s defense cortex

HARTLEY
Yes -- so it’s keeping him from
fighting back

Bart squints at the second floor of the house and spots SASHA
climbing onto the balcony He tries to alert Gabby but she’s
distracted by a sudden inspiration

GABBY
Wait a minute If we restart his
frontal processor the defenses will
kick in again Could we just
reboot him

HARTLEY
He’s a three billion dollar robotic
soldier He doesn’t have an onoff
button

GABBY
(with a shrug)
Sorry That’s what I always do
with my powerbook

Colonel McFee’s had enough talk - he grabs the phone

MCFEE
Young lady This is Colonel
Raymond J McFee of the US Army
You report to me now and I demand
to know what you have in mind--

Gabby SHUTS THE PHONE with a sigh She has no time for this
She turns to hand the phone to Bart but he’s GONE

INT NEVEAH’S ROOM - SAME

FROM ALBERT’S POINT OF VIEW we see the hacking device
getting closer to breaking the access code

Kat paces in front of him like a dictator
KAT

Well Maybe Gabby does have

feelings for you Maybe she read

your manual But I control you

And I order you to stay with me
Kat points at Albert then turns to see her posture and
expression exactly matches a the life-sized wall poster of
NEVEAH leading her cheer squad

KAT (CONTD)
Okay now that’s that’s not fair

Albert falls on the bed and begins to CONVULSE
KAT (CONTD)
Albert Albert
EXT NEVEAH’S BALCONY - SAME

Sasha hides in the darkness on Neveah’s balcony He checks
the tracking system for his hacking device It flashes

“ACCESS GRANTED READY FOR NEW MISSION COMMAND”

Sasha smiles - victory is his

INT NEVEAH’S ROOM - SAME

Kat’s shaking Albert trying to get a response from him when
Gabby rushes in with Neveah right behind her

NEVEAH
Stay out of my room--AGH

Neveah sees Kat and Albert on the bed and recoils
NEVAEH
Ugh Please tell me you guys

weren’t just working it on my bed

GABBY
Kat - you have to get out of here
KAT
Stay out of this Gabby

NEVEAH
And the man-stealing continues

Albert is stone faced Unresponsive--

KAT
Youve got a boyfriend Gabs Even
if it’s just a summer camp fling
I can’t even keep a guy who is
programmed to love me

NEVEAH
Ha I knew it was a set up

GABBY
Yeah Kat I’ve been meaning to
tell you I don’t have a
boyfriend He doesn’t exist

Kat’s jaw DROPS Neveah waves it off--

NEVEAH
Least shocking surprise ever

GABBY
Boys are weird and stressful and
I didn’t want to deal with it so I
made one up You were so obsessed
I figured I’d help you get one
Now I wish I never had because
it’s ruining everything

KAT
No Gabs you ruined everything by
stealing him

SASHA (0S)
ActuallyThat was me

SASHA has stepped in from balcony GUN IN HAND

Neveah tries

to makes sense of it all looking at Albert then at Sasha

NEVEAH
Ohhhh Duh I knew Albert was way
too cute to be straight

GABBY
He’s not gay he’s a terrorist
(scared of the gun)
Not that there’s anything wrong
withbeing a terrorist

SASHA
Shut up Too much talk You talk
talk talk like little schoolgirls

KAT
Well dude if the shoe fits--

SASHA

Shut up
(to Albert)

Revise mission protocol
Albert stands at attention

ALBERT
Revising mission protocols

Gabby and Kat look on in horror Neveah’s not sure what’s
going on but she knows it’s bad

NEVEAH
I can’t have a terrorist in the
house My parents will freak

At that moment BART rushes through Neveah’s door and tackles
Sasha They tussle for a moment - and Bart GRABS THE GUN

Bart pops to his feet triumphantly Sasha slowly stands up
and raises his hands

BART
Ha ha Who’s the smart guy now

Quick as a flash Sasha reaches out and steals the 9mm right
back as Bart tries in vain to pull the trigger

And as fast as it started Bart’s heroic moment is over
BART (CONTD)

You had the safety on And that
makes you the smart guy

INT THE AFTER PARTY - SAME

McFee Hartley and all the CIA agents stride through the
front door of the mansion flashing badges

MCFEE
Remain calm You’re safe now
We’re with the government

Immediately all the kids start to scatter and panic Tony
watches them going by with a beer in hand

TONY
Were getting busted by the Feds
That’s epic

Out by the pool the panicking kids realize the place is
SURROUNDED in every direction by agents

MCFEE
We’re not here to arrest anyone
Were looking for a runaway teen
named Albert Banks

It doesn’t stop the kids from scattering in all directions

INT NEVEAH’S ROOM - SAME
Sasha sneers at Bart and gives Albert a command

SASHA
Apprehend him

Albert grabs Bart by the collar

KAT
Albert Stop it

Albert’s not listening Gabby whispers to Kat--
GABBY
We have to shut him down -- reboot
him somehow--
(she shouts at Albert)

Restart Reboot Control alt

delete
But nothing works To Kat and Gabby’s horror Albert LIFTS
BART off the ground - and carries him to the balcony
EXT THE AFTER PARTY - SAME

There’s a collective GASP from the party-goers as Albert
appears dangling Bart over the railing

Hartley shouts to the CIA agents--

HARTLEY
That’s my son He’s got my son

Sasha appears on the balcony He holds all the cards now

SASHA
Black Sigma controls the prototype
Put the guns down

(to Albert)
Prototype Arm your weapon
systems

ON MCFEE AND HARTLEY Hartley checks his pocket Geiger
Counter - and its needle suddenly swings wildly

HARTLEY
He just went nuclear

MCFEE
Everyone hold your fire Albert is
hot

One of the female PARTY-GOERS chimes in sarcastic

PARTY GIRL
Hello uh news flash

INT NEVEAH’S ROOM - SAME

Somewhere inside Albert a weapon of mass distruction is
arming itself filling the room with a low HUM Kat pleads--

KAT
Albert Listen to me Look

Kat pulls out the STRIP of pictures from the photo booth at
the mall Kat and Albert together - pure puppy love

KAT (CONTD)
You and Me We have something and
it’s real Look It’s real

Albert swivels his head studying the picture--

SASHA
Prototype Erase memory

INSIDE ALBERT’S HEAD images of Albert and Kat together are
being deleted from his memory

KAT
You said it today When you find
that person you’re meant to be
with nothing else matters Not
missions not wires or microchips
or bombs You said it’s like
magic Show me you weren’t
lyingLet Bart go

Albert stares at her - seemingly touched But after a
moment he turns back and GRIPS Bart a little tighter
Kat charges at Albert PUNCHING AND KICKING HIM

Everyone from Sasha to Bart and Gabby to the CIA agents
scream for her to stop expecting Armageddon at any minute

KAT (CONTD)
You know what That’s it I’m
breaking up with you

ON ALBERT Something clicks within him--

INSIDE ALBERT’S POV a new line of command code appears
“PRIMARY MISSION ABORTED PERFORM RESET”

Albert’s vision goes DARK for a moment And then after a
moment there’s a strange CHIMING NOISE A reboot

GABBY
Omigosh Kat You did it

KAT
(despondent)
I know I dumped the perfect boy
I’m crazy right

GABBY
No - you rebooted him

Sasha is angry now Insistent He shouts at Albert--

SASHA
X-17 I order you Kill them

Albert pulls Bart back over the railing and sets him down
He turns to Sasha-- who fires the gun several times--

RIGHT INTO ALBERT’S HAND

Albert calmly catches the bullets then reaches forward and
crushes the gun into a tiny molten ball - and EATS IT

BART
(impressed)
Awww who’s the boss

EXT DOWN BY THE POOL - A MOMENT LATER
The house is rocked by a giant CRASH as a projectile smashes

THROUGH THE ROOF of the house - arcing through the air and
splashing into the pool

Two CIA agents drag SASHA from the water like a rag doll

GABBY KAT AND BART come down the stairway Jenks and the
other agents rush past them in pursuit of Albert

Kat runs into Hartley’s arms like the scared kid she is
Hartley’s awkward at first Then he hugs back as hard as he
can - more than anything else just a grateful dad

ON BART AND GABBY watching the agents cuffing Sasha
BART
The Playstation version of war is
way less painful Did I hear right
that you do not have a boyfriend
Gabby smiles a little bit

Neveah comes down last She stares up THE HOLE IN HER ROOF
in abject horror REVEAL that Jaden is standing next to her--

JADEN
UmNeveah This might be a bad
time butI want to break up
Agent Jenks appears on the upstairs balcony
AGENT JENKS
He’s gone We swept the whole

house Albert’s gone

McFee and Hartley look up in disbelief They look at Gabby
and Kat for answers But they only SHRUG

MCFEE
Lock the perimeter The X-17 is
still at large
Military CHATTER begins over the walkies
GABBY (VO)
And that’s pretty much everything
that happened
INT INTERROGATION ROOM - THE PRESENT

We’re right back where we started with McFee staring down
Gabby and Kat pressing for answers

SUPER A TITLE THE PRESENT

HARTLEY
Where is Albert Tell us now
GABBY
I told you - Kat rebooted him His
missions were deleted No one
controls him He’s on his own

MCFEE
He’s a rogue weapon He could be
anywhere

GABBY

You know what they say If you
love someone set them free If
they don’t come back they could be
a threat to the entire planet But
if they show up at Homecoming it’s
super romantic

Kat looks up hopefully Hartley gets Gabby’s meaning--

HARTLEY
You two don’t actually think youre
still going to the dance

GABBY
There’s a one percent chance Albert
could show up there today And
those are the best odds you’ve got

MCFEE
Why would he risk that He doesn’t
answer to Kat anymore

GABBY
He’s still a soldier And soldiers
keep their promises

McFee and Hartley look at each other considering

MCFEE
No Out of the question

HARTLEY
Okay So we call the President and
tell him we have no plan

Off McFee’s angry stare we dissolve to

INT KAT’S BEDROOM —- HOMECOMING DAY

Gabby and Kat stand in HOMECOMING DRESSES looking at
themselves in the mirror They look gorgeous

Agent Jenks guards the door She gives them a thumb up

EXT THE HARTLEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Gabby and Kat walk out to a pair of stretch limos

Bart stands waiting He tries to pin a corsage on Gabby’s
dress but the flower keeps falling over

INT LIMOUSINE - AFTERNOON

Kat and Hartley sit in the back of one of the limos as it
rolls through Glen Hills with full military escort

HARTLEY
You look beautiful

KAT
All dressed up No one to dance
with

HARTLEY
I would but I’m not cool enough

KAT
It’s okay Without Albert I won’t
have any friends Maybe not even
Gabby I wish you never invented
him That we never designed him

HARTLEY
Look kid I dream things up for a
living It never turns out the way
you plan Not an invention not
life Not love But it doesn’t
mean we shouldn’t dream

KAT
What happens if Albert shows up
What will they do with him

HARTLEY
Sweetie That’s classified

Kat smiles sadly and goes back to looking out the window

EXT GLEN HILLS HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - EVENING

The limos arrive Hartley gives Kat a hug

Kat watches Gabby and Bart getting out of their limo
They’re doing that “After you no after you” thing

Awkward

nervous adorable first date stuff

INT THE HOMECOMING DANCE - SAME

The standard gymnasium Homecoming soiree Kat Gabby and
Bart survey the scene

KAT
This must be the first Homecoming
dance ever chaperoned by the CIA

Sure enough there are agents posted all around the perimeter
of the gym This isn’t a high school dance It’s an ambush

KAT (CONTD)
He’s not showing up is he

GABBY
Maybe he’s off in a third world
country fighting a crazy dictator

KAT
You mean like me
(a smile of apology)
Sorry I went off the deep end I
got hopped up on hormones and crazy
took the wheel

EXT THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT - ESTABLISHING

A trailer labeled “FUN PARTY DJs”

INSIDE it’s the MOBILE COMMAND center Hartley and McFee
sit at a bank of monitors McFee runs point via walkie

Gabby smiles - same old Kat Bart leads Gabby out onto the
floor along with a few other slow-dancing couples

Kat looks out at the dance floor twinkling with muted disco
lights and some silly slow jam song

KAT (CONTD)
Back to square one

JADEN (0S)
Does that mean you can help me with
calculus again
Kat looks up to find JADEN - not what she was expecting
IN THE COMMAND CENTER

McFee’s ready to spring into action But Hartley stops him

HARTLEY
It’s not Albert

MCFEE (INTO WALKIE)
Stand down This one’s not
dangerous

HARTLEY
He’s a teenage boy He’s dangerous

BACK IN THE GYM

Jaden leads Kat out onto the dance floor They start to slow
dance And it can’t help but be a little magical

JADEN
You were expecting Albert

KAT
Oh no I meanit looks like
he’s transferring schools again

JADEN
He moves a lot Are his parents in
the military or something

Kat tries to read Jaden’s smile How much does he know

KAT
Sorry about you and Neveah I
thought you guys were like the
perfect couple

JADEN
I hope not

They laugh NEVEAH watches them from the edge of the dance
floor Tony stands next to her

TONY
Do you want to dance

NEVEAH
I just broke up with your friend

TONY
(with a shrug)
So You’re hot
Neveah turns to consider Tony and we’re
BACK ON KAT AND JADEN
JADEN
You know one night when you were
tutoring me I actually did think
about asking you out But then I
chickened out

KAT
You were scared Of me

JADEN
I know Weird right

And Kat’s reminded this is what real high school boys are
like Awkward Trying too hard And kind of adorable

The song ends and the dance floor clears revealing
ALBERT Looking dapper in a classic Armani suit

Forget handsome Put a tux on this kid and it’s unfair
A buzz goes through the gym

JADEN (CONTD)
Your real date just showed up

Jaden starts to walk away but Kat calls after him

KAT
Hey Jaden--Thanks for the dance
It was really nice
IN THE COMMAND CENTER
Everyone springs to action
MCFEE

Hartley holds up his hand

HARTLEY
Just give them a minute

BACK IN THE GYM

Albert takes Kat’s hand The music is a perfect slow dance

ALBERT
Sorry I’m late

KAT
Well Nobody’s perfect

GABBY AND BART are dancing a short distance away
GABBY
He’s so cute I hope she doesn’t
do anything stupid

Bart turns to look at her Gabby corrects herself

GABBY (CONTD)
Anything else stupid

ON THE EDGE OF THE DANCE FLOOR
AGENT JENKS powers up an electro-pulse gun just like the
Sasha used A pull of the trigger and Albert will be out
literally - like a light
ALBERT PULLS KAT CLOSER They almost touch noses
KAT
Don’t kiss me yet I want this

moment to last

ALBERT
It doesn’t have to end you know

Kat looks around Eyes are trained on them from all sides

KAT
I think running would be difficult

the country and protecting the
common good You’re one of the

good guys
KAT

I try to be
ALBERT

I had to make sure that you’re
going to be okay without me And

Albert opens his hand - the palm SLIDES AWAY revealing a RED

BUTTON
IN THE COMMAND CENTER
Hartley’s Geiger monitor goes ballistic

HARTLEY
Wait a minute - he’s armed

MCFEE
Move in

BACK IN THE GYM

Albert leans forward KISSING KAT and pressing his hand

against Kat’s - DEPRESSING THE RED BUTTON
It’s a remember-it-forever kind of kiss

ALBERT
Goodbye Kat It’s been real

Albert’s feet start to HEAT UP with a red hot internal
combustion

GABBY AND BART realize what’s happening--

GABBY
Get back

They pull Kat away pushing the other students back
Suddenly with a bone-rattling ROAR

ALBERT TAKES OFF LIKE A MISSILE through the roof

EXT FIELD OUTSIDE THE GYMNASIUM - SAME

Kat Gabby Bart and the rest of the kids run outside
colliding with Hartley and McFee

Hartley looks up as his life’s work is escaping the
atmosphere leaving a curving column of smoke

Even Neveah and Tony run out to watch its ascent

NEVEAH
Oh my God That’s insane

TONY
Not as insane as how hot you are

nearly

Neveah stares at him for a beat - and they start MAKING OUT

GABBY AND BART stand shoulder to shoulder looking up
BART
What an exit That dude makes the
rest of us look bad

GABBY
I don’t know You do alright

Bart and Gabby look at each other dreamy

Meanwhile KAT’S gaze is so glued to the sky that it takes
her a second to realize JADEN is standing next to her

JADEN
Wow A perfect logarithmic curve

KAT
Yeah That’s right

JADEN
I’ve been meaning to tell you
I’m actually pretty good at math

KAT
Then why would you need a t--

Kat figures it out - and BLUSHES

From miles above the cloud cover a series of MASSIVE
EXPLOSIONS shakes the sky McFee stares up in agony

MCFEE
What was that Where did he go

HARTLEY
Back to the drawing board

As everyone stares up at the fireworks show Gabby catches
