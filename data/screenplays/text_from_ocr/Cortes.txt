Original Screenplay

REVISED
EXT TENOCHTITLAN MOONLIT NIGHT

A man in a loincloth running along a causeway

The moon hangs in the water behind him

A conch-shell trumpet blows Ancient haunting call
Legend

City of Tenochtitlan
Aztec year 1 bundle 13 rabbits

The Runner is carrying something
Sprinting all out for his life

CUT TO
INT MOCTEZUMAS PALACE NIGHT

The Runner breathless babbling in a language we cannot understand
He throws down what he was carrying

Facing him is a PAPA (Priest) dressed in black robe long black hair
matted with blood 4 fingernails bloody earlobes wild eyes

The Papa waves his hand dismissing the Runner and bends down to
pick up the Runners burden

CUT TO
INT MOCTEZUMAS SLEEPING QUARTERS NIGHT
The Papa enters hesitantly As he moves through the dark room we
glimpse furnishings which suggest an austere elegance A low bed
covered with a spectacular feather blanket
The Papa passes the empty bed goes out onto a
EXT BORDERED ROOF NIGHT
From the rear MOCTEZUMA staring at a comet blazing in the sky
The Papa speaks eyes lowered to the ground
Moctezuma replies with a single word
The Papa sets down the Runners burden and leaves
Moctezuma turns and stares at what is on the ground

CORPSE of a large bird

The Emperors features betray no reaction - hes seen it before - but
his eyes fill with sick apprehension of his fate

He turns back toward the comet
Runs his hand along the parapet

Noalong a snake 5-foot python We hear a smokey old voice

DIAZ (VO)
Forget it

With an ease suggesting great familiarity Moctezuma picks up the
snake and carries it inside

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Forget who you arewhere you
arewhat you know
DISSOLVE TO
INT CUBAN COUNTRY HOUSE AFTERNOON

Rain assaults the windows as a half-dozen HIDALGOS (landowners) and
their wives feast drink and listen to a wild and ribald story

DIAZ (VO)
Forget it all and come

CUT TO
EXT ROAD AFTERNOON

A rain of obliteration seemingly capable of washing away our
memories A carriage hurtles through the storm

DIAZ (VO)
Come with me back to my youth

INSIDE THE CARRIAGE
DIERO a sniveling hunchback hands wringing eyes gleaming
DIAZ (VO)

Back to the greatest military
campaign in human history

CUT TO
INT CUBAN RANCH HOUSE AFTERNOON

From these few moments inside this house we will infer the state of
Western civilization Everything proudly displayed yet primitive we
are scarcely out of the Middle Ages

DIAZ (VO)

Cuba 1519

Just 27 years after Columbus

It was the time the place and the
ageof Cortes

MAIN TITLE CORTES
CONTINUE MAIN TITLES
As the titles flash we focus on the man telling the ribald story

DIAZ (VO)
When I met him he seemed like any
other man

Volume up faintly in the room CORTES 34 is speaking with mocking
sophistication of the youthful fantasies which drew him to Cuba

CORTES
Yes of course I dreamt of
knighthood and wealth but the real
dream was To go where no Christian
has gone To see what no
Christian has seen

His audience in the palm of his hand

CORTES (CONTD)
But first there was a married woman
who had smiled at me and I
wondered

They laugh and he continues (volume down) how he was chased by an
angry husband broke his leg and had to stay in Spain another year

DIAZ (VO)

Cortes laughed drank told a good
story He looked happy But like
many other men his life was not as
good or peaceful as it seemed

CORTES WIFE sits at the far end of the table

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
He had been forced to marry his
wife and did not love her

Pan to ANOTHER WOMAN odder and more beautiful than his wife

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
The woman he loved he could not
have

Pan along his FRIENDS idle gentry

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
And his friends were men he wanted
to love but could not find cause
(the CAMERA approaches his
FACE)
CorteswaS a manwho was

waiting

Cortes finishes his story to laughter and applause immediately
interrupted by POUNDING AT THE DOOR The knock of fate
A SERVANT ushers in a drenched Diero

CORTES
Come in come in my little twisted
gnome Sit down Have some wine

DIERO
Velasquez is sending another
expedition to Yucatan Island

For an instant Cortes stops short -
Diero snatches some wine and heads off toward another room
Cortes stares after him then recovers his amiable exterior

CORTES
I have always admired his beautiful
manners
(to the others)
Excuse me

CORTES LIBRARY MOMENTS LATER
Diero drinks directly from the wine bottle

DIERO
The Governor wants Bermudez to head
the expedition but perhaps with
my influence

He stares at Cortes with glee relishing his power To his dismay
Cortes is remarkably matter-of-fact

CORTES
How much do you want

DIERO
Half your profit

He smiles nervously thinking Cortes will erupt angrily

Instead Cortes stares at him with an expression close to amusement
Then he sticks out his hand

Diero stares at the hand hesitates (should he ask for more) and
shakes The deal is done

DIERO (CONTD)
Well Iguess Ill join the
others
(retreating)
I cant believe it was so easy

He starts out As the door is closing

CORTES
Nothing is that easy
Meaning he wont pay
He opens the shutters stares out at the rain
We study his face Cheekbones rising nostrils flaring slightly

Something is happening to him Something dramatic Like a caterpillar
turning into a butterflyonly this is masculine

He crosses the room and pulls a curtain Revealing

A MAP of THE KNOWN WORLD Europe is carefully drawn but
disproportionately large and central Africa is sketched Asia is
huge vague South America does not exist at all

Below North America is Cuba and below Cuba is the Yucatan island
Handwritten on the Yucatan Per Cordoba and Grijalva expeditions

Cortes stares at the map and dips his quill into ink
From the Yucatan he draws an arrow Westward
Deep into what we now know to be Pacific Ocean his pen stops
He draws a question mark
Stares at it
Sets down his quill
The fire in his eyes would light a city
CUT TO
INT GOVERNMENT BUILDING DAY
Cortes stands before DON DIEGO VELASQUEZ Governor of Cuba

VELASQUEZ
-explore the area and trade with
the natives You are not to venture
inland not to settle the land not
on any cause to consort with Indian
women

As Velasquez drones on we realize Cortes isnt just accepting his
commission hes also - despite his respectful pose - carefully
studying his patron

DIAZ (VO)
Don Diego Velasquez conqueror and
Governor of Cuba vassal of King
Carlos of Spain benefactor and
future enemy of Hernan Cortes

(as CAMERA MOVES IN ON

VELASQUEZ )
He was a man ruled by cowardice
fear and greed Remember his face

(MORE )
There wadt AZ (GOVT 5D homent in our

campaign when this mans spectre
did not stalk us Yet we never
saw him again

Velasquez finishes his speech licks his fat lips
Cortes makes a standing bow with his hat
Velasquez moves away

Cortes turns toward a crucifix kneels quickly and crosses himself
We realize that the bow toward Velasquez was pro forma Cortes is now
paying homage to his true master

Velasquez stares at him realizing the same thing
CUT TO
EXT DOCKS DAY

Men load a ship Some plain and rough some gentry even the gentry
are tough self-made men rather than limp aristocrats

Cortes banner flies high over a line of recruiting tables set up on
the dock We move down the line

1ST INTERVIEWER
Which expedition were you on

2ND RECRUIT WITH SCAR (VILLAFANA)
(charming grin)
I want a cauldron full of gold

THIRD INTERVIEWER (VELASQUEZ DE LEON)
-a business venture If you
contribute money a musket a
horse then you get extra shares

CORTES (FOURTH INTERVIEWER )
I wrote to your father not you
Youre too young

Hes addressing Gonzalo de SANDOVAL whose enthusiasm intensity and
slight stammer make him very likeable and somewhat comic

SANDOVAL
Im t-t-twenty-two

CORTES
Exactly Tend to your pimples

SANDOVAL
I havent had a pimple in years
Find me a place or I will stow with
the rats

As Sandoval steps aside the Third Interviewer (JUAN VELASQUEZ DE
LEON 27) mutters something to Cortes about the applicant hes
interviewing PEDRO DE ALVARADO 34 a golden boy with long red hair
a massive physique a gold chain and sublime confidence

ALVARADO
Isnt trouble what were looking
for Im stronger than any man in
your army and happier I can
wiggle my ears and I can pull a
horse down with one hand

Cortes stares at him But his stare is interrupted by a terrible
squawking from the other end of the dock Cortes glances that way
turns back to Alvarado

CORTES
Step over there

Alvarado saunters to one side as the commotion moves toward them
CRISTOBAL DE OLID protesting loudly is being dragged by THREE MEN
Olid is so strong he could toss the others into the drink so we
sense hes actually coming of his own free will

CORTES (CONTD)
Senor Cristobal So nice of you to
visit How are your headaches

CRISTOBAL OLID
Try to make me join Ill kill you

CORTES
No no you misunderstand I
brought you here for a contest of
strength

CRISTOBAL OLID
Dont bore me

CORTES
This man claims he can beat you

ALVARADO
Not just you I can beat anybody

CORTES
(motions see)
Please Teach him some humility

CRISTOBAL OLID
I am not a schoolmarm

CORTES
Youre walking from a challenge

Cristobal blinks stalks to Alvarado holds out his right arm with a
confidence that is electrifying no way he can lose

Alvarado grabs the outstretched hand and they commence A terrifying
display of raw strength

CORTES PAGE sprints down the dock and whispers to Cortes
Cortes turns to PUERTOCARRERO a shy handsome nobleman

CORTES (CONTD)
How soon can we sail

PUERTOCARRERO
Two-three days

CORTES
How many minutes

Diero is heading toward them accompanied by armed SOLDIERS
Puertocarrero makes for the boats starts shouting orders

The contest of strength continues so equal its comic Both men
strain and grunt but their hands do not move even a millimeter

As Diero approaches Cortes motions to a SECOND PAGE hiding in one
of the dock buildings

The Second Page unmuzzles and releases a MASTIFF which races toward
the men barking fiercely leaping up on them -

Cristobal curses flails at the dog with his free arm which allows
Alvarado to throw Cristobal to the deck

Diero tries to speak with Cortes -
Cristobal leaps up enraged -

CORTES (CONTD)
(to Cristobal)
Its true then He is stronger
(to Diero)
One minute

CRISTOBAL OLID
That miserable cur almost bit me I
demand a proper contest

CORTES
Were sailing Only way to get
satisfaction is to come along

Cristobal glares Cortes takes him aside ignoring Dieros protests -
CORTES (CONTD)
Ill give you a quarter of my
profits

CRISTOBAL OLID
What profit Youre going to die
CORTES
Then do it out of friendship

CRISTOBAL OLID
I never liked you

Cortes rolls his eyes Clearly they have a friendship but Cristobal
is professionally grumpy -

CORTES
For glory then

CRISTOBAL OLID
Whose Youll get it all

CORTES
(clutching at straws)
Well I hear the native women

three hours with one of them is
worth a five year affair here in

Cuba And you can take as many as
you want

CRISTOBAL OLID
A hundred

Cortes does a slight double-take quickly recovers

CORTES
Two hundred or more

Cristobal nods soberly Certainly a factor worth considering

DIERO
Cortes As mayor of this town and
emissary of the governor I demand -

CORTES
What is it my friend

DIERO
You are under arrest If you do not
go quietly my soldiers will fire

The Soldiers aim their muskets at Cortes

CORTES
What am I charged with

DIERO
Treason Plotting to exceed your
authority and conquer the Indians

Both men look up at Cortes BANNER which reads Comrades Follow
the sign of the cross and through it we shall conquer

Cortes stares at the muskets He doesnt seem to have much choice He
holds out his hands to be manacled and for a moment it seems our
story will be over before it begins

DIAZ (VO)

Looking back I have often wondered
how many men in Cortes place
would even have made it out of
port

As the Soldiers move to shackle Cortes he says loudly

CORTES
But I must caution you These men
already feel loyalty to me I cant
be responsible for what they might
do to your town or your person -

DIERO
(outraged)
You are inciting them to -

CORTES

(quiet confidence)
No If I incite them youll know
it

(as Diero hesitates)
We sail in ten minutes

(giving him his excuse)
What a pity you didnt get here in
time to stop us

Diero nods He will accept this ploy

CORTES (CONTD)
You cowardly sack of slime
(as Diero bridles)
Just a figure of speech
(embracing him whispers )
Dont forget your 50

DIERO
You will regret that insult

CORTES
No Ill either dine with trumpets
or die on the gallows but Ill
regret nothing

Cortes heads toward his ship Puertocarrero at his side On the deck
of the ship ahuge pile of crucifixes of varying sizes

CORTES (CONTD)
How short are we

PUERTOCARRERO
Fifty men and half our supplies

CORTES
Well stop in Havana

He notices Sandoval climbing aboard ship -

CORTES (CONTD)
Hey Kid

Sandoval winces he got caught

CORTES (CONTD)
Can you look a man in the eye and
lie

SANDOVAL
I can learn

CORTES
How old are you

Sandoval looks Cortes straight in the eye

SANDOVAL
T-t-t-twenty-five

CORTES
(playful)
Jesus That is awful

He motions for Sandoval to jump on board As they do -
CUT TO
EXT SHIP NIGHT

FLAPPING SAILS suggest ocean voyage HOLD Then PAN DOWN TO thick
fog like a mysterious sinister intimation

Cortes paces the deck In the bg the other ships are anchored
close at hand Men are assembled on the decks of all the ships

DIAZ (VO)
It is only 150 miles from Cuba to
the coast of the Yucatan

None of us had any idea the true
distance we were travelling

Cortes pauses looks at BOTELLO a small exotic man nervously
examining tarot cards and dispensing gloom to three Deckhands

Puertocarrero comes up to Cortes and nods the men are ready Cortes
climbs to the topdeck and peers out posture of a great lord His
voice echoes in the fog

CORTES
My friends my partners
Tomorrow we land
Tomorrow we place our lives and
fortunes in the hands of God for
we know not where we go who we
meet what horrors we encounter if
there will be men or arms or beasts
far stronger more numerous and
more terrifying than our own

We can BeORGES GGANT EDIn1y one

find three leagues of bad road
(pregnant pause)
BUT WE ARE SPANIARDS

The men cheer wildly

CORTES (CONTD)

Few in number but strong in arm
--and will and resolution
Stronger still in the love of God
With His Grace may we go
In His Name may we survive

(peers out at fog)

The men cheer but a slight chill lingers the unknown

Into this chill steps the acerbic priest FATHER OLMEDA As he begins

EXT SPANISH CAMP (YUCATAN) DAY

Flat beaches few trees In the center of camp A MAPMAKER (MARTIN
LOPEZ tall stork-like) uses ink finger and fingernail to draw the
Yucatan on a scroll He marks the spot where they landed

INSERT - MAP
(See Next Page)
EXT SPANISH CAMP

Mundane details Men washing clothes swatting mosquitos cleaning
off the large pile of crucifixes The Mastiff runs around wagging its
tail peeing ONE COMMON SOLDIER very young is eating an orange and
carefully placing the seeds in a handkerchief

DIAZ (VO)

The Yucatan was so named because
the first Spaniards who landed
asked the name of the country and
the natives answered Tectetan
meaning I do not understand you

The CAMERA moves out of camp into the dense brush A LONE INDIAN
Motionless Watching the Spaniards

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We corrupted the word to Yucatan
So the place is named I do not
understand you

Commotion in camp A SCOUTING PARTY is returning with spoils a few
trinkets and 50 turkey chicks Alvarado waves a fistful of fowl

ALVARADO
Chickens here Good fat chickens
Fresh grub for everybody

CORTES
How did you get these chickens
ALVARADO SANDOVAL
They gave them to us We t-took them

Alvarado glares at Sandoval then winks its okay no sweat

CORTES (CONTD)
And the trinkets

ALVARADO
Theyre hardly worth 50 60 pesos

CORTES
The next man who steals will be
hung We are here to make friends
is that understood

SANDOVAL
Yes sir

ALVARADO
(mocking)
Yes sir

CORTES
(re Alvarados tone)
Are you a moron

ALVARADO
Well
(grins)
peopleve said it But I dont
really agree

Cortes cant help smiling This kind of jerk is hard to resist
ALVARADO (CONTD)

Besides I did make friends with
the Indians They like me -

We glide away from them down the line of 16 horses

DIAZ (VO)
The thing I remember most about the
Yucatan was not the turkey chicks
but something that seemed a mere
curiosity

The last of the horsemen is holding a human skull He passes it down
to Cortes who examines it briefly and tosses it to his PAGE

The youthful Page inspects it with curious morbidity Clearly the
first time hes handled such a thing He holds it up to the light
and we realize with a sickening shock this is an omen

CUT TO
EXT A BAY IN LUSH FOREST DAY

The Spanish ships are harbored in the bay bg The men are rowing
some lifeboats toward the shore

DIAZ (VO)
We sailed on to Tabasco

Suddenly 100 Indians emerge from the woods leap into the water -

Spaniards leap into the water too The CAMERA moves in on Sandoval
who is quickly surrounded by FOUR INDIANS

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Our first military skirmish was
unimportant save one thing Four
Indians surrounded Sandoval They
could easily have killed him but

they didnt even attempt it All
they tried to do was take him

prisoner It seemed strange
Sandoval is rescued by two countrymen The Indians retreat Sandoval
sighs with reliefthen stares after the Indians Why didnt they
kill me

CUT TO
EXT SPANISH CAMP (VERACRUZ) DAY
Cortes cuts a cross into a silk cotton tree
CORTES
I claim this land in the name of
God and his majesty King Carlos

Father Olmeda nods Velasquez De Leon glares at Cortes

Cortes Page ushers over TWO INDIAN CAPTIVES and MELCHIOR the
translator an Indian wearing a long red Spanish cloak

PAGE
Two captives my liege

CORTES
And can our invaluable translator
speak their dialect

MELCHIOR
Yes my lord

CORTES
(to Melchior)
When you were captured by the
previous expedition wasnt it near
to here

Melchior blinks Cortes laughs quickly changes the subject
CORTES (CONTD)
These Indians have gold trinkets
Where did they get them

Melchior translates The Captives point East and say Mexico

CORTES (CONTD)
Mexico Is that a river

MELCHIOR
(a beat then)
No a lake

CORTES

I see Ask them what dangers we
face

At this question the Indians converse in an animated fashion Cortes
watches them keenly sensing something He interrupts

CORTES (CONTD)
How large is this approaching army

Melchior does a double-take -

CORTES (CONTD)
When will it get here

MELCHIOR
A week Maybe more

Cortes nods He knows Melchior is lying
CORTES
Good Then we have time to prepare
dont we

EXT CAMP DAWN
Cortes walking watching checking on his men He passes Martin
Lopez adding to his map We notice that Lopez has now found a quill
pen to use for his mapmaking

INSERT — MAP

(See Next Page)

SPANISH CAMP

As Cortes walks on we notice the extraordinary beauty of the natural
surroundings Every tree is virgin forest lush sweet dense we can
almost smell the rich foliage

CORTES
Comrade

A soldier CERVANTES (a buffoon with a distinctive blond beard) is
sleeping on his watch He wakes with a start sees Cortes and
scrambles to his feet -

CORTES (CONTD)
Go remind everyone the penalty for
sleeping on watch is death

CERVANTES
Yes sir thank you sir I promise
I wasnt drinking sir

Cervantes scurries off He passes a red cloak draped over a tree
branch It is Melchiors cloak flapping eerily in the wind

As Cortes approaches it he sees de Leon watching him -

CORTES
I suppose its better to have no
translator than one whose loyalties
are divided

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Divided loyalty can be a problem
(gestures toward the cross
marked in the tree)
You cut the tree in the Kings
name not Velasquez’

CORTES
But thats understood We serve
your cousin Velasquez but every
Glory goes to God and King Carlos

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
A very good answerfor now

CORTES
You think I will mutiny against
your cousin I give my word that
will not happen
Velasquez The Lionhearted nods surprised and pleased
An alarm sounds a call to battle

CORTES (CONTD)
Will you fight at my side

Velasquez De Leon buckles his armor
CUT TO
EXT BATTLEFIELD DAY

10000 Indians in wild feathered costumes faces painted black and
white hurtle toward

Spanish infantry They cock their muskets and fire
The first line of Indians falls -
The whole Indian army stops short

Silence You can hear the trees rustle You can also hear the awe and
bewilderment inside the Indians heads

The musketeers re-load as the crossbowmen fire

More Indians fall But the rest of the natives seem to realize this
is the nature of the battle They resume fighting

The next time the Spaniards fire the Indians keep coming

Quickly the battle is joined Hand-to-hand combat fierce athletic
and competitive (Underneath barely audible A RUMBLING SOUND )

The Spaniards stay in tight formation backs to each other so their
rears are protected and their superior weaponry can prevail The
Indians fight as individuals seeking captives We realize this is an
army of soldiers vs a band of warriors

As the RUMBLING SOUND grows louder we focus on Cristobal in battle
he is a different man An animal Fierce wild fearless the
equivalent of 20 men he seems to rejoice in battle Our admiration
grows with each second we watch himand then he speaks

CRISTOBAL
Im getting cranky Where the hell
is the damn - (cavalry)

Then he too hears the RUMBLING Turns to see the Indians watching

The Cavalry race toward them Horses These huge beasts spit flying
from their mouths the incredible musculature of their chests this
wild look in their eyes

DIAZ (VO)

We knew from the two previous
expeditions that the natives had
never seen horses before

The Indians gape in consternation but stand their ground until the
horses only yards away are reined in so that they raise their front
legs in an apparent attack posture -

The Indians flee in terror

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
They thought these beasts were
centaurs magical creatures half-
men half-hornless deer
As the cavalry gives chase the Indians vanish into the woods
CUT TO
EXT SPANISH CAMP DAY

Men relaxing enjoying the victory Cortes sits under a copse of
palms and watches as his Page leads a horse toward him

DIAZ (VO)
This battle gave our Captain his
first brilliant idea
A small mare was in heat
Cortes shakes his head directs his Page to a different spot

Satisfied Cortes nods and the mare is tethered She squats and rubs
her bottom on the ground

CUT TO
EXT SPANISH CAMP EVENING
Cortes under the same palm trees the mare is gone
Approaching him is a procession of Indian Caciques These brightly
adorned chiefs have holes in their lips and ears in which rings and
stone disks have been inserted
Cortes leads the Caciques to the spot where the mare was sitting
They bow to him he bows back No-one to translate

Cortes signals and his Page leads a STALLION WITH RIDER toward them

The horse whinnies loudly smells the ground snorts paws the
ground Hes staring right at the Indians

The Indians cower Why is this beast so angry at them
Cortes mimes he wants food
The Indian Chiefs nod anxiously and back away in fear -
CUT TO
EXT SPANISH CAMP RIVERBANK THE NEXT DAY
An Indian procession Porters bringing food followed by ten
BEAUTIFUL NATIVE GIRLS (nine naked to the waist) and lastly FIVE

CHIEFS In the center supported by several men because hes too
large to walk is the FAT CACIQUE their leader

DIAZ (VO)

As Cortes requested food came
and other gifts

But these Indians were not the ones
wed been fighting Instead they
came from Cempoala We were
learning that as in ancient
Greece the land here was divided
not into countries but into city-
states

As the half-naked girls approach the Spaniards - Cristobal most
especially - stare with undisguised lust

ALVARADO
I like the one in green

Cristobal sticks out his hand arm-wrestle

ALVARADO (CONTD)
No no youre champion now You
pick first

CRISTOBAL
(nods stares)
Actually I like them all

The Fat Cacique arrives in front of Cortes dismounts from his litter
with some difficulty and attempts to bow

Cortes stifles a smile and bows back

LATER

Nine Indian Girls are being baptized by Father Olmeda as the Spanish
Captains look on admiring the girls breasts

CORTES
I trust no man casts a lascivious
eye on a religious ceremony

CRISTOBAL
The contrary We are filled with
awe at what the Lord has created

Velasquez De Leon approaches preceded by the tallest and most
beautiful of the Native Girls MARINA still fully clothed

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Captain this one speaks Spanish
(as Cortes looks her over)
She claims to have been a princess

CORTES
Whats your name

MARINA
Malinali Tenepal You will call me
Marina

CORTES
I will eh
How did you learn Spanish

MARINA
When my father died my mother the
Queen sold me as a slave to favor
the children of her second husband
Another slave with me was a
Spaniard

CORTES
From which expedition

She shrugs

CORTES (CONTD)
Where is this Spaniard now

MARINA
Gone
(ie dead)

CORTES
He was your lover then

MARINA
(flat)
No

Cortes stares at her She stares back A pride both admirable and
infuriating

CORTES
Soyour own family your own
mother betrayed you

MARINA
She betrayed herself

He stifles a smile of appreciation

CORTES
Since you are a princess and
deserve the best I give you
(looks over his men seems to
focus on Alvarado)
to my good friendPuertocarrero

Puertocarrero steps forward blinking shy but quite pleased Marina
shoots him the briefest glance

CORTES (CONTD)
However you will be on call day
and night as my translator

Conch shell trumpets sound

A cortege of ornately dressed INDIANS approaches Their clothing
hairstyle and manner all set them apart from the Cempoalans

In fact the Fat Cacique is being carried toward a dense grove of
mangrove trees Hes gesturing frantically hurry hurry

The rest of his tribe precedes him In seconds they are gone Cortes
glances at Marina then at the approaching Indians -

MARINA
Aztecs They have conquered most of
these towns from a city Mexico
high in the mountains

CORTES
Mexico Where the gold is
MARINA
They call it excrement of the
Gods
CORTES

Then you - youre not an Aztec

MARINA
Never The Mexicans conquered my
city They rule harshly through
fear

Her eyes dart toward the woods where the Cempoalans are hiding
Cortes follows her gaze

CORTES
Good

She shoots him a glance Why good

The AZTECS arrive Their simple cloaks and sandals evoke the garb of
the Ancient Greeks

On the other hand their ears lips and noses are garnished with
pendants formed of precious stones

SERVANTS cloud the air with copal incense others display gifts

THREE PRINCES touch the ground then their heads in greeting They
speak alternately diffusing their identity

MARINA
They come from the great Lord
Moctezuma who sends these gifts as
a token of friendship They say his
capital is too far to travel to
and the road beset with too many
enemies

CORTES
Good God

The Servants have set out two magnificent circular plates one
silver the other gold both as large as carriage wheels The silver
plate represents the moon the gold one the sun Both are ornately
wrought with calendar signs and images of Gods

Cortes young PAGE (who through dress and manner suggests the
coming of the modern mercantile age) steps forward to recount

PAGE
The gold plate alone is worth
20000 pesos and the workmanship
surpasses anything in Europe

CORTES
These bribes whet my appetite

MARINA
We Indians say the greater the
gift the greater the King

CORTES
Tell them I too come from a
powerful King who orders me to pay
personal respects to Lord
Moctezuma of whose greatness he
has long heard tell As I have had
a difficult journey over the sea I
dare not return home without seeing
Moctezuma face to face

SANDOVAL
King Carlos doesnt know -

Cortes silences him with a look -
One of the Aztec Princes replies testily
MARINA
You hardly arrive and you insist

on seeing on our Emperors face

One Prince points at something and the others jabber excitedly
Cortes watches this then glances inquiringly at Marina

MARINA (CONTD)
They call you Teules Gods Or
perhaps those sent by the Gods

Cortes nods thoughtfully
MARINA (CONTD)
(pointing)
That soldiers helmet reminds them
of the War God Huitzilopochtli

Cortes whispers to his Page who runs to fetch the gilt helmet

CORTES
They may take this helmet to show
the great Moctezumaproviding
they return it filled with gold We
Spanish suffer a disease of the
heart which can only be cured by
gold

He gestures and four horses approach their bells jingling
The Aztecs stand mouths agape watching the horses

An Aztec scribe quickly paints the horses onto bark paper He has
already sketched Cortes Marina and the Spanish ships

ON CORTES AND MARINA
Walking together

CORTES
The helmet horses Is that why
they call us Gods

MARINA
Your looks ships clothing - its
all strange to them You are not
like men So what are you

CORTES
(nods answers )
Gods Which ones

MARINA

They mentioned the great Teule
Quetzalcoatl 500 years ago he
sailed to the East promising to
return He had light hair like
some of your men Perhaps you are
him Perhaps King Carlos is
Perhaps this your coming fulfills
an ancient prophecy

(as Cortes thinks)
You must know to the Aztec
prophecy is law It is even the
same word

We see a thousand calculations race through Cortes mind

CORTES
You say the Aztecs rule but the
other cities hate and fear them

MARINA
Yes

CORTES
Then we can win

Theyve reached the woods where the Fat Cacique and the other
Cempoalans are hiding

CORTES (CONTD)
Ask him if he is a vassal of the
great Moctezuma

She speaks the Fat Cacique quickly replies

MARINA
Who is not

CORTES
Tell him we will protect him We

It is time to return to Cuba

Cortes stares at him

CRISTOBAL OLID
We speak for many of the men

CORTES
Is something wrong with the girl I
gave you

CRISTOBAL OLID
No shes veryprimitive
(smile then frown)
but so are the mosquitos here
theyve activated my skin rashes -

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
And considering the gifts Moctezuma
has already given us -

CORTES
Do you leave the table if the
appetizer is savory

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
We were sent here to make contact
To trade We have done so We have
gold beyond our expectations -

CORTES
Whose expectations

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
And - most important - we have done
our duty and completed our mission
Anything more would be mutiny

Cortes stares at him
CORTES
Youre right Of course
We sail in the morning
Cristobal grins de Leon is taken aback

CORTES (CONTD)
Please spread word among the men

MINUTES LATER

From a distance we see the news disseminating and the expressions
incredulity and outrage it evokes

An angry crowd is descending on Cortes tent

Cortes continues to polish his boots seemingly oblivious to the
uproar But his attention is focused on

Outside a nearby tent Puertocarrero and Marina sit on the grass

Cortes stares at him at the others
He jumps up on a makeshift table and the men quiet
CORTES
The decision I made earlier has
caused great dissention
Cheers and angry shouts from the crowd
CORTES (CONTD)
I realize now I cannot fulfill my
moral obligation to you and also to
the esteemed Governor of Cuba
Honor therefore requires that I
resign my post
He jumps down from the table
Stunned silence

Murmurs in the crowd What does this mean What happens now Do we
choose a new leader

Sandoval glances quickly at Cortes as if for a sign
Cortes gives none Velasquez de Leon watches as

Sandoval waits Looks around Bites his lip and gives Cortes
another glance -

Very subtly Cortes nods -
Sandoval jumps on the table Speaking publicly his stutter is gone
SANDOVAL

If Cortes is loyal to us are we
loyal to him

CROWD
Yes
SANDOVAL
Do we want a new leader
CROWD
No
SANDOVAL

Then who must we serve the
Governor of Cuba or the King of
Spain

CROWD
The King of Spain

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
(wry to Cortes)
This is very well done

CORTES
Thank you

SANDOVAL
Then let us found a new city in
the name of the King

As the Crowd cheers Velasquez de Leon mutters sarcastically

VELASQUEZ DE LEON

If we fail to conquer if we cannot

King Carlos directly give him the
treasures Moctezuma has sent and
beg him to grant us supremacy
(turns to Puertocarrero and
another Hidalgo)
Since you have relatives in court
you two can best plead our cause

PUERTOCARRERO

himself down beside the shackled Velasquez de Leon

CORTES
Velasquez knew we would betray him
He himself forced our hand

Velasquez De Leon says nothing

CORTES (CONTD)
By withholding funds he made us
spend our own fortunes which we
did mortgage our homes which we
did He cannot then expect us to
return home and suffer bankruptcy

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Nevertheless Velasquez is my
relative and I remain loyal

CORTES
I admire that
I will release you tomorrow

VELASQUEZ DE LEON

Why not today Now

CORTES
You need time to think

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
About what

CORTES
The purpose for which you are born

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Oh please

CORTES
Do you really want to return to
Cuba and live the life of a
nobleman feasting off the labor of
others and seducing your neighbors
wives

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Sounds pleasurable

CORTES
It is pleasurable And common
Any Frenchman can do it
But here
If we have courage intelligence
spirit we can achieve something
remarkable And the most remarkable
part is We dont know what were
about to do
We only know that if we succeed we
will have been truly alive And

Cacique is stuffing himself jabbering happily

MARINA
He regrets that only nine of his
wives can be here to serve us

CRISTOBAL
How many wives does he have

As Marina translates the others eat with evident relish

MARINA

Hes lost count The more you have
the more alliances you make Also
the more children which allows you
to make even more alliances when
they grow up

(hesitates then translates )
He says its his duty as a chief to
spend most of his time in bed

Everyone laughsthen they notice something odd in the Fat
Caciques expression He is no longer laughing He is staring with
dread out at the street where

FIVE MEN with dark glossy hair tied in a bun wearing richly-
embroidered cloaks stroll with cocksure pride through the square
They sniff bouquets of flowers while SERVANTS whisk away flies Their
stiff walk their arrogance tells us these men are killers

At the sight of them the Fat Cacique turns pale starts babbling

rape the pretty women and sacrifice

Marina hesitates to translate this

Cortes nods translate

She does
The Fat Cacique falls to the ground and begs for Cortes mercy

CORTES (CONTD)
Tell him he has nothing to fear

As Marina translates the Fat Cacique continues to babble like an
infant and roll on the ground

Can I w-watch what you do

Cortes nods slightly as -

MARINA
They say you know who they are
since you are responsible for their
capture The Cempoalans wouldnt
dare arrest them on their own

If this were true would I now
release them and feed them and
treat them as Kings

says to her)
I am impressed you betray nothing

The fire rises higher up the mast

Another ship explodes into flame

Cortes himself with a torch setting a ship aflame His eyes are wide
crazed as if possessed by some demon Pyromania When the ship is
well lit he dodges through the flames climbs over the side into a
lifeboat and heads for the next vessel His torch held high in the
air

EXT LOW MOUNTAINS DAY

A cloud of pink butterflies The Spanish Army marches through it
followed by a small group of Indian warriors and PORTERS

Three of the Porters are burdened with heavy piles of crucifixes the
crosses the Spaniards brought with them on their ships The sight of
these innocent natives bearing symbols of human guilt is doubly
ironic because of the magic of these surroundings
woods
waterfalls
meadows

sky

mountains rising and falling

fields of flowers of raucous color

It all strikes some atavistic memory Long ago before civilized
man wrecked his havoc this is how the world used to be Paradise

DIAZ (VO)

We saw no bird no flower no tree
or animal we had ever seen in
Spain

It truly was a New World

Cortes pauses to survey his surroundings Snowy peak on the left and
a strange bleak mountain topped with a black coffin-shaped rock on
the right In the distance two volcanos spew ash

DIAZ (VO)
We were marching to a city-state
called Tlascala

Cortes resumes the march Behind him other Spaniards pick their way
along the trail

MARINA
By their courage and their
location high in these mountains
the Tlascalans have kept their
independence from the Aztecs

Cortes suddenly stops yanks something from his collar and throws it
to the ground A piece of colored paper We notice

A series of threads hang across the trail Dangling from them are
bits of paper in odd shapes and bright colors

MARINA (CONTD)
Charms To keep us out

From a distance we see Cortes slice the threads with his sword This
POV tells us hes being watched

CORTES
Send our message again If blood
is spilled it is on their heads
We come in peace seeking allies

A distinctively dressed MESSENGER sprints away -

Suddenly by a camera trick we see INDIANS in the forest 30 of
them Staring motionless They seem to be of the trees

EXT TLASCALAN TOWN DAY

Deserted Two tiny native dogs sniff the huge Spanish Mastiff Center
of the square lattice-work cages containing captives

MARINA
Men to be sacrificed

Cortes cuts the leather lock and throws open the cage

Some captives run Those who seem stronger and braver do not Cortes
tries to chase them away shouting and waving his sword

CORTES
Go Run Flee you morons
(lunging with his sword)
What you want to die

MARINA
Aztecs

CORTES
Are Aztecs so stupid

MARINA
They learn from birth the greatest
honor is to die in battle or be
sacrificed as a prisoner of war

Cortes stares at them the foe he will soon face FIVE MEN watching
him blankly without fear without pride without affect

CORTES
Make them kneel
(as his men hesitate)

Make them kneel if you have to cut
off their feet

Spaniards force the prisoners to their knees
Cortes removes the cross from his neck and holds it over them
CORTES (CONTD)

Father say a mass for the souls of

these poor devils
Olmeda begins
The Spaniards fall to their knees All of them The movement carries
down the hill until even those who cannot see let alone hear have
joined the prayer

After a slight hesitation Marina also kneels

For a moment we are witnessing a religious ceremony

Then spectators

EIGHT PAPAS proceed slowly one by one out of a nearby cue They are
dressed in dark green hooded cloaks decorated with images of skulls
and Gods Their thick hair hangs to their feet and is matted with
blood Evil magicians out of Dr Seuss Their fingernails are 5
long and they click them as they walk

Olmeda ignores them The other Spaniards want to rise but cannot do
so without being disrespectful to their God

The Papas march round the cage uttering incantations
Cortes shoots Marina an enquiring look -

MARINA
Priests Theyre called Papas -

CORTES
They stink

MARINA
Blood From sacrifices and from
stabbing themselves with thorns
They are the sons of Chiefs have
no wives and they indulge in
sodomy
Cortes stares at the Papas in astonishment and disgust
The Mastiff barks furiously at the Papas and strains at its leash
One Papa brings something from under his robe
A human heart dripping blood
He holds it under Cortes nose
MARINA (CONTD)
Hes trying to see if youre a God
(off Cortes look)
A God would eat it
The heart inches from Cortes mouth

His nostrils flare Hard to stifle the homicidal impulse Suddenly
in the midst of a Latin phrase

FATHER OLMEDA
To arms

It takes a second for this to register
The Papas scurry away -
The barking Mastiff falls dead arrow in its chest -

FATHER OLMEDA (CONTD)
To arms men To battle

The Spaniards look up INDIANS descending -
The sky darkens with stones and arrows -

The Spaniards rise fumble for weapons Several men are hit by the
arrows -

Indians rush forward Startling attire great feather crests bodies
and faces gaudily painted Caciques adorned with spectacular animal
headdresses Cacophony they bang drums whistle blow trumpets

The Spaniards surprised and overwhelmed hastily retreat behind
neighboring houses

They load muskets and crossbows Unsheathe swords Ready their
lances

At a signal from Cortes they move out into the open again

The town is deserted The Indian army has vanished The Spaniards
move forward warily fearful of another attack

But there is nothing to fear Nothing to see
Except a cooking pot lying in the center of the square

In the pot is an Indian tunica distinctive one Someone lifts
it examines it

MARINA
Your messenger They killed him

and ate himand intend to do
the same to you

A wave of horror and disgust passes through the Spaniards As if to
counter any fear in his men Cortes is quite matter-of-fact

CORTES
Why dont they believe we seek
allies
Marina looks into the pot takes out a drawing of a bird
MARINA
They think its a trick and youre
secretly in league with the Aztecs
Cortes nods peers out at the haunting landscape

So It begins

Sandoval points up to a bluff overlooking the battle XICOTENCATL THE

Xicotencatl The Elder is 140 years
old and still the greatest
Tlascalan chief

A HUGE COMMOTION as the battle is joined Alvarado screaming leading
the Spaniards cutting a swath through the Indian ranks

The CAMERA PANS over the battlefield until we come to another bluff
on which stand 3 AZTEC SCOUTS

DIAZ (VO)

The Aztecs watched in fear For
centuries they had tried to conquer
Tlascala And failed There we
were only a few hundred men
fighting battle after battle day
after day

Return to the battle Velasquez de Leons horse has been wounded
Hes trying valiantly to protect it but there are too many Indians
around and he is finally driven back

The Indians begin quite crudely to sever the horses head

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
The head of this horse was borne
that night to every city in
Tlascala so the people could see
it was not a supernatural creature

The battle rages through A SERIES OF DISSOLVES as the light fades

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We fought all day We fought until
we could no longer lift our arms
and by some miracle they
retreated

The Indians blow their conch shells pound their drums and shout
Alala Alala They throw straw and dirt into the air to obscure
their retreat Soon a brown cloud hovers over the field
DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)

We hoped our victory might weaken

their resolve
As the dirt falls and the air clears the battlefield is empty
No warriors No Indian corpses Where have they gone

Eerie As if it had all been a mirageexcept that a score of
Spaniards lie dead in the dirt

Cortes looks at Sandoval shakes his head

CORTES
Wont even let us see their dead

Slowly cautiously the Spaniards tend to their fallen comrades

EXT SPANISH CAMP EVENING

Cortes (the ever-watchful father) Marina and Sandoval walk through
camp They pass men repairing crossbowsmaking arrows

Small carcasses being roasted on a spit

DIAZ (VO)

For the third straight night we
had nothing to eat except a few
small dogs and a handful of native
figs

Nearby a small pot boils Men dip rags into it and apply the rags to
their wounds

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Every one of was injured To
cauterize our wounds we had to use
fat cut from one of the few Indians
carcasses we were able to retrieve

A few Soldiers seem disgusted by the human fat in the pot
Suddenly A SENTRY calls in the distance
The men rush to their weapons -

MARINA
Indians do not attack at night

CORTES
They only have to do it once

The Men relax as they see
A LONE INDIAN walking toward them waving a flag
Cortes and Marina step forward to meet him The messenger speaks

MARINA
Xicotencatl The Younger says
If you are tired of fighting you
may come to Tlascala in peace
»e-and your flesh will be hacked
from your bodies and spiced with
chilies and eaten with pleasure

CORTES
Tell Xicotencatl a scared man
speaks
A brave man acts
I will meet him tomorrow

The messenger leaves and Cortes moves on passing

Men in bedrolls wearing their armor sleeping fitfully or lying
rigid with their eyes open

Farther on is a tent where Father Olmeda is taking confession
DIAZ (VO)
Despite the bravado of our captain
there was hardly one of us who did
not take confession that night
Inside the tent a very young SOLDIER is weeping

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We feared death for we were men

Even Olmedas voice is quaking slightly
CUT TO
EXT BATTLEFIELD MORNING

From a distance we see a lethal confrontation which has clearly been
going on for hours We move

CLOSER

The Indians coming like a tidal wave one leaping over another too
numerous to fight too numerous even to discern The Spanish ranks
are in chaos

DIAZ (VO)

At noon the following day I knew

for the first time knew it in my

bones that I would die in New

Spain
The Spaniards look like theyve gone down twice and are struggling
for a last breath Frantic overwhelmed unable to process the chaos
assaulting them It seems that soon the wave will rise again and wash
the Spaniards away and only Indians will fill the plain

But Cortes is fighting cool and strong amid the panic Hes moving in
a circle ever in a circle looking for something we cannot see

Suddenly he stops Stares in one direction
A FLAG rising above the Indians
Cortes plunges sword first toward it

CORTES
Here Follow me Here is our mark

He heads toward a CACIQUE with a spectacular head-dress whose
servants hold the flag We feel Cortes will dominating those around
him Sandoval and other Hidalgos follow him

The Indians are too tightly packed to effectively fight back Those
near the Cacique seem bewildered by Cortes assault

DIAZ (VO)
Among so many chiefs why did
Cortes attack this one

Cortes kills the Chiefs servants Sandoval stabs the Chief

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We later learned this Cacique was
not supposed to fight not supposed
to be attacked Their Gods had said
he would lead them to victory

The Indians around them stand back in horror and watch as Cortes
Page lifts the Indian banner

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Their prophecy was invalidated The
true fate of this battle was
revealed

Cortes pushes onward and the Tlascalans retreat wailing in alarm
sending panic throughout their ranks

Men in armor lie in bed moaning shivering uncontrollably dying

Cortes and Marina emerge to find a delegation headed by

CRISTOBAL OLID
The men we are fighting are our
intended allies far weaker than
the Aztecs and they are defeating
us The idea of reaching Mexico is
a joke I say it you know it We
cannot survive another battle

CORTES
(softly)
Where will we find fewer enemies

A strange and almost lyrical query which silences Cristobal Cortes
looks out at the surrounding countryside

CORTES (CONTD)
Here in this exotic land if we
retreat or show weakness the very
stones themselves will rise against
us If the natives believe we are
Gods so must we be

CRISTOBAL OLID
You be a God Im going home

A sound Cristobal blinks They all peer down the road
A delegation of unarmed Indians bearing food wearing white badges
MARINA
Peace Theyre sending food
And porters to prepare it
CRISTOBAL
All right
First we eat then we go home
CUT TO

Spaniards wolfing down the food
Tlascalans serving it Friendly obsequious observant
Cortes eats with Marina Something on his mind
CORTES
Didnt you say Dont Indians
sometimes send food to the enemy
so that the battle will be a fair
one
Marina nods
CORTES (CONTD)

So if they truly want peace why
didnt Xicotencatl come

Marina shrugs -
CORTES (CONTD)
Ask if they are sent by Xicotencatl
the father or the son

As she does this Cortes observes one of the Tlascalans peering into
a tent Another has persuaded a Spaniard to show him his musket

MARINA
He says the father has ordered
peace and the son has sent them
here
Cortes ponders thisstares at the man being questioned

CORTES
Interesting distinction
Ask if hes a spy
Cortes watches as she translates and the Man shakes his head

CORTES (CONTD)
Cut off their hands

Velasquez de Leon and Marina look at him with alarm -

He grabs the docile Tlascalan whos serving them The man seems
sweet bewildered by this action

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
What if theyre not spies

CORTES
Then Im wrong

He is holding the man by the wrists staring at a nearby SOLDIER The
Soldier hesitantly unsheathes his sword

Cortes nods and the Soldier brings down his sword
CUT TO

Before Cortes stand both Xicotencatls They bow touch the ground
with their hands and kiss their hands

I cannot defeat a man who reads my
mind

Xicotencatl The Elder moves slowly arms outstretched toward Cortes

EXT TLASCALA DAY

Small ceremony beautiful VIRGINS being presented to the Spaniards
Marina translating something about the Indians joining their
families with the Gods We move away from this spectacle to find

The same Young Soldier we once saw eating an orange now squats by a
building He takes sprouted orange seeds from a wet handkerchief
plants them six inches apart and two inches deep and gently covers
them with soil This is YOUNG BERNAL DIAZ Several Tlascalan children
are watching him As always his voice is old gravelly

DIAZ (VO)

There were so many heroes in our
campaign it is hard for me to
confess that I was only a young
boy Much that I tell I saw with my
own eyes much was told me by
others some was common conjecture
I may not report everything and
some things I have forgotten
because I am old some I never
knew but as a Christian I swear
I tell nothing I know to be false

Coming up the road is a DELEGATION OF AZTECS

The presentation of the Virgins ends they go off with prominent
hidalgos who by now have several women apiece

Cortes steps forward to meet the Aztecs who bow wave their copal
incense and begin the ritual presentation of gifts

MARINA
The great Moctezuma salutes your
victory

The Aztecs spread out jewelry and cloth embroidered with feathers
and return the gilt helmet now filled with grains of gold Again
Cortes Page steps forward to give an accounting

PAGE
The jewelry is worth 1000 pesos
the helmet with gold 3000 The
cloth is beatiful but worthless

CORTES
(nods )
Bring a pen and scroll
I will write Moctezuma a letter

SANDOVAL
In S-Spanish

CORTES
He will see it has meaning and know
our writing is more advanced

The Page returns with the materials and prepares to write

CORTES (CONTD)

Moctezuma
I will not rest until your power is
my power your gold is my gold
your kingdom is mine to hold in my
hand I will see that all the souls
in this land have given up their
devilish idols and sworn devotion
to the one True God

(very intense)
Some way some how at whatever
cost I will achieve these things

Silence Other Spaniards stunned by the frankness of this message
The Aztecs watch curiously wondering what just happened

Cortes smiles broadly bows and the Aztecs relax

CORTES (CONTD)
(to Marina)
Translate it I have the greatest
respect for Moctezuma and so
forth
As Marina begins to translate
kind of invitation

the Aztecs smile and gesture some

DIAZ (VO)

The Aztecs were scared They knew
it was time to confront us and
they did it in the slyest most
sinister way imaginable they
invited us home

EXT TLASCALA DAY

An army of Spaniards and indians ready to march Cortes is receiving
a warningblessing from Xicotencatl the Elder

MARINA
Now that I know you I know you
eat food as men do love women as
men do and in battle you weary
just as men do If you go on
100000 men will fight you When
these are vanquished that many
again will come and again and
again until though you be
invincible you will grow weary and
die But if you are determined to
go I will send these warriors and
also my three youngest sons to die
by your side

The THREE YOUNGEST SONS look eager and innocent Xicotencatl The
Younger - not among the three - watches from nearby

Xicotencatl The Elder fervently clutches Cortes hand

CORTES
Tell him to care for his health so
I can see him again when we return

As Marina translates Cortes jumps on his horse starts away
The procession begins A magnificent spectacle
Marina walks at Cortes side
MARINA

I was mistaken The Aztecs are

leading us not to Mexico but to

their sister city Cholula They

say we will be well taken care of

Spaniards being served an enormous feast by beautiful flirtatious
native GIRLS The clown Cervantes peers skeptically at a dish to make
sure it does not contain human flesh

DIAZ (VO)
In the religious capital of the
Aztec Federation we were honored
by a silly and affectionate people
who showered us with flowers and
kisses and cooked the most
exquisite delicacies
We were in heaven
We were in hell

Cortes stands by the window sometimes looking out sometimes
watching his men

A CHOLULAN GIRL approaches with a plate of food

MARINA
You dont want to eat

Cortes looks through her not hearing the question

CORTES
Theyre whores

MARINA
What

CORTES
The girls tending us theyre not
daughters of noblemen
CRISTOBAL
Oh relax will you These people
are harmless fools
Again Cortes doesnt hear He stares out the window

At either end of the block pedestrians seem to be avoiding the
center of the street

CORTES
Marina go down and see what you
see

Cristobal watches her as she leaves

CRISTOBAL
Are you certain of her

More than of you

CRISTOBAL
Think with your head not your

EXT CHOLULAN STREET DAY
Wide clean streets pedestrians dressed in long cloaks embroidered

Marina walks happily but keeps a keen eye

At the end of the block she notices the peculiar walking pattern
which Cortes observed from above Moving closer she sees

Cloth has been spread on the ground and dirt thrown over it
She approaches the cloth
Cholulans watch her silently

Lifting the cloth she sees a hole in the ground Spears are pointed
upward inside the hole

She calls to a nearby PEDESTRIAN He minces over to her with the
exaggerated manners of a flamboyant homosexual She points at the
spears and asks a question Their conversation is subtitled

PEDESTRIAN

This is a silly thing we put here
to protect Cortes from evil

spirits

MARINA
It would do more damage to horses
than to spirits
Why are so few women and children
in the street

We hadnt noticed this until she said it

PEDESTRIAN
They are off to the mountains for
vacation

MARINA
(sarcastic)
For their health

She stands As she strolls back toward the Spanish quarters she
glances idly into the sky ahawk or other large bird circling
lazily

Her gaze skyward is interrupted by a HANDSOME WOMAN of 45 with a
furtive air who grasps Marinas arm

HANDSOME WOMAN
Youmust not return to the white
men
(long beat)
My son saw you He does not want

you to die

MARINA
Why would I die

HANDSOME WOMAN

Mexico has sent an army The white
men will never leave our city

alive

Marina staring at Cortes We assume this is the moment when shes
deciding whether to tell him

She starts to speak Before she can Cortes turns to her and
indicates TWO NEARBY PAPAS

CORTES
We leave for Mexico in the morning
Ask them to provide us with
porters and to have the citys
leaders in the square so we may bid
them a proper farewell

This was a chance to be a hero to

She puts her fingers to his lips silencing him
MARINA
Tell yourself this Once I was a
princess Now at your side I ama

by my name What more could I ask

He nods his understanding But her expression betrays more We sense
the truth is she does everything because of him

They are surrounded by the Spanish Army

3000 Cholulans pack the square including Papas Caciques porters
Cortes gestures to his Page who bangs a large atabel

Silence His words fill it Marina simultaneously translates

CORTES
Dear friends We are grateful for
the extraordinary hospitality you
have extended in so short a time

Spaniards put a screen across one entrance to the square

CORTES (CONTD)
You have fed us pampered us and
freely given usyour whores

A second screen closes a second entrance Horsemen with spears
their places in front of the screen

CORTES (CONTD)
We know that you are allies of
Moctezuma that you must take
orders from him and that sometimes
those orders run contrary to your
wishes and your own sweet nature

The third screen is put up Horsemen take their places

CORTES (CONTD)
For example we know he has sent an
army now on the outskirts of your
city which plans to attack us with
your help

take

The Cholulans look around in confusion and alarm Why is he saying

this How does he know it Why is his tone so mild

The screen for the fourth and last entrance to the square is stuck

TWO SOLDIERS try vainly to put it into place as

CORTES (0S) (CONTD)
And we know you have given help
You have put stakes in the street
stacked rocks on the roofs of your
houses evacuated women and
children and you intended to
slaughter us even though we are
your guests

Cortes looks at the last entrance still open
He waits
Anxious silence

CORTES (CONTD)

I know all this because I know
everything

The Cholulans stand in fear and in awe this man is surely a Teule

Forget the screen A dozen soldiers move to fill the last entryway
When Cortes sees this is accomplished

CORTES (CONTD)
Sadly you leave us little choice
We are going to kill you now all
of you in rightful punishment
The Cholulans blink in disbelief -

A few turn helplessly toward the gates but most are simply
bewildered in shock

No one moves

Everyone watches Cortes

He looks slowly over the whole square

The Cholulans contemplate their imminent death
Beat

Cortes nods

Gunfire screams shoutsbut we see only Cortes A drop of blood
flies onto his armor

Then another
MORE Hes getting spattered
As the sounds of the massacre become intolerable they fade down

Two drops hit Cortes face and he closes his eyes Serenity on his
faceor perhaps denial

A long silent beat

DIAZ (VO)
It was war We did what we did

Marina and Father Olmeda are also getting splattered with blood

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Whatever else you say the
strategic value of this massacre
was enormous Again we appeared to
have read the native mind and we
displayed a wrath so awesome it
seemed Godlike

Without opening his eyes Cortes turns toward Father Olmeda

CORTES
If we can convert one more Indian
save one more soul from damnation
then this will have been -

We were right to attack the

Moctezumas wishes and plotted
against us

Does Moctezuma think Im stupid

Whats he selling me now

The Aztec Prince is indicating that the left fork is preferable

Cortes smiles politely to the Prince and proceeds down the fork to
the right As they go

DIAZ (VO)
Remember now the furor Columbus
discoveries had caused throughout
the civilized world
Though we were on this bleak trail
for many reasons - to grow rich to
grow famous to die young - still
there was one desire which touched
us all We wanted to look over the
mountain We wanted to see the
exotic new world

Behind Cortes Marina is riding beside Sandoval Her manner here
formal reserved She simply wants the information

Can you tell me something

More than that
It is pure

MARINA
Like love of your God

Do you 1l-love Cortes

Please try again later to explain

Theyre cresting a hill Cortes turns back toward them and growls

CORTES
Are you giving her ideas

SANDOVAL
No sir

A change comes over Sandovals face

CORTES
Then whats wrong

Sandoval tries to speak cant Blinks Shakes his head

Cortes suddenly realizes Sandoval sees something
Cortes whirls -
The Valley of Mexico stretched below them

A spectacular city filled with huge stone buildings built on the
water connected to land by long causeways It seems like an
enchanted vision I do not know how to describe this first glimpse
of things never heard of seen or dreamed of before This is a
magical realm a kingdom from our fantasies

The faces of the Spaniards are filled with awe

Over the center of the city one large bird-of-prey cuts slow circles
in the azure sky

CUT TO
EXT CAUSEWAY DAY
The Army moving along one of the dikes

Every structure - houses towers pyramids - is crowded with natives
Likewise the lakes are darkened by swarms of canoes filled with
Indians straining for a glimpse of these pale outlandishly dressed
strangers

The welcome is powerful and eerie Not warm not triumphant
certainly not cold and antagonistic It is wary The inexpressive
native faces heighten the feeling that we have entered an unknowable
universe

Floating on the lake are fairy islands of flowers These mobile
islands undulate as the water rises and falls

The causeway itself is only nine yards wide crowded with natives
and broken occasionally by bridges

One of Xicotencatls Sons at Cortes side points to a bridge
MARINA

These are easily removed Soon we
will be trapped inside their city

CORTES
(nods )
They must wonder why we look so
confident

In the distance the royal palanquin blazing with burnished gold
approaches It is borne by nobles and bears a canopy of gaudy feather-
work powdered with jewels and fringed with silver

Cortes descends from his horse
He puts on his helmet topped with a plume of feathers
The canopied bier stops and slowly MOCTEZUMA descends

Though we saw him at the opening of the film in darkness that
glimpse did not prepare us for the spectacle we now witness

He is magnificently clad in a turquoise robe studded with pearls and
jewels gold sandals and spectacular feathered headdress Servants
strew the ground with cotton tapestry so his imperial feet do not
touch the soil

Everyone around him except the most prominent nobles has their eyes
lowered they cannot look at the Great Speaker

On either side of Moctezuma are princes CUITLAHUA and CUAUHTEMOC
The CAMERA FOCUSES on one then the other

DIAZ (VO)
Two great Princes flanked
Moctezuma His brother Cuitlahua
had sworn to be our enemy and would
have caused great harm had he not
died of smallpox brought by one of
our soldiers The Emperors nephew
Cuauhtemoc vowed he would achieve
our extinction For most of us he
kept his word

Cuauhtemoc only 25 has about him a sense of assurance and command
usually reserved for those of far greater age His features are long
delicate and very grave

Moctezuma himself is 40 years old handsome tall His hair is black
and straight his beard thin his complexion rather light He moves
with dignity and there is great intelligence in his eyes

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Moctezuma had ruled for 17 years
Once the fiercest of warriors he
was now a deeply religious man He
knew from his reports and his
oracles that one way or another we
were to be his fate

The two leaders stare at each other

They bow

There is a long and magnificent silence This moment - the meeting of
two such sophisticated and yet wildly different civilizations - is
unique in human history Both sides simply stare in wonder

Finally the frozen moment is broken as the Princes around Moctezuma
with seeming reluctance touch the ground then bring their hands to
their chests and heads

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Their hearts and minds welcomed us

Cortes takes out a necklace of glass beads and puts it around
Moctezumas neck It looks crude and plain next to the Aztec jewelry

Then Cortes starts to embrace Moctezuma but the other Aztec Princes
rush forward and stop him Cortes nods and steps back

Moctezuma speaks Marina begins to translate Toward the end of this
speech her voice FADES SOFTER as simultaneous SUBTITLES come up
Eventually her voice stops altogether though her physical placement
tells us she is still translating

MOCTEZUMAMARINA
O Lord our Lord you have arrived
in this land your land your own
city of Mexico to sit on your mat
your stool which I have guarded
for you Your vassals the old
kings my ancestors are gone
Would that one of them could rise
from the dead astonished and see
what my eyes truly see for in no
dream do I see your face Ah these
days five ten a string of days
I have been anxious watching for
you waiting to see you appear from
your hidden place among the clouds
and mists For I was told you would
appear you would return to sit on
your mat your stool and it is
come true Welcome and rest Rest
now Rest in your palace With your

lords and companions take your
rest

Moctezuma grasps Cuitlahuas hand turns and walks toward the city
Cuauhtemoc takes Cortes hand and they follow

Cuauhtemoc is seething Marina walks at Cortes side

MARINA
Moctezumas greeting is warm The
Great Speaker seems to see you as
the fulfillment of the ancient
prophecy the return of the
Quetzalcoatl

CORTES
And the others

MARINA
They are morecautious

Cortes glances at the angry Cuauhtemoc

CORTES
Thats an understatement

looks compared to the Indian population and the magnificence of the
city

With hostile civility Cuauhtemoc leads Cortes and his hidalgos
through gardens which are far less formal but no less beautiful
than the French gardens Louis XIV would create 175 years later

DIAZ (VO)
The next day Moctezumas nephew
Cuauhtemoc gave us a tour of Aztec
wonders At first we thought it an
act of hospitality

Fruit trees
Borders of trellises supporting aromatic shrubs and creepers

Riotous washes of pink and purple and lavender subtle shadings that
delight the eye and nourish the soul

Fields of exotic orchids not hot-house creations but hearty
flowers dancing gaudily into the distance

Cuauhtemoc does not speak and there is no need The magic of Aztec
reality washes over us

A lattice of reeds covered with blooming flowers marks our passage
into the

AVIARY

Cardinals quetzales endless species of parrots hummingbirds
Cuauhtemoc is completely at home as if he too were a bird

Marina (present as always whenever we see Moctezuma or any of the
Aztecs) seems to share this sense of peace The Spaniards do not

Cortes is restless looking around He squints Points up

CORTES
Whats that there

Cuauhtemoc does not even glance where Cortes is pointing Like
Moctezuma his words are SUBTITLED

CUAUHTEMOC
A golden eagle

The GOLDEN EAGLE has an individual perch high over the other birds

CORTES (VO)
Why is it kept separate

CUAUHTEMOC
Qur city was built here because my
ancestors saw an omen on the lake
agolden eagle with a serpent in
its talons its wings spread wide
to the rising sun

Cuauhtemoc walks on as if he wants to change the subject Seeing
this Cortes lingers

CORTES
A magnificent bird

CUAUHTEMOC
We see fewer and fewer alive

We suddenly realize this is the same breed as the one whose dead
carcass was brought to Moctezuma in the pre-credit sequence

Leaving the aviary we enter a
ZOO
Pumas ocelots alligators etc
CUAUHTEMOC
When we sacrifice our enemies we
feed the torsos to these beasts
A casual and gracefully delivered threat
Cortes nods and follows Cuauhtemoc toward the
SNAKE CAGES
Various vipers moccasins coral snakes

Cuauhtemoc watches keenly for Cortes reaction

CORTES
I dont like snakes

Marina does not translate this Cortes looks at her
MARINA
The God Quetzalcoatl in spirit
form is half-bird half-snake

Cortes looks into a cage with two RATTLESNAKES

CORTES
Open the cage

Marina translates

Cuauhtemoc orders it and the cage is opened

Cortes enters

One of the snakes is asleep the other looks at him warily

MARINA
The most dangerous of vipers

Cortes takes a step forward

The snake starts to rattle

MARINA (CONTD)
This noise is a warning -

Cortes freezes Not a muscle twitching

The snake moves its head side to side watching him
Cuauhtemoc observing

Cortes immobility calms the snake

Then Cortes moves Perversity

The snake rattles furiously -

Cortes throws his handkerchief -

The snake strikes -

At the handkerchief

Cortes strolls calmly out of the cage

Cuauhtemoc looks back and forth between Cortes and the snake not
quite sure what hes just witnessed

round stone covered with markings

Even now 50 years later this
stone crammed with symbols of
knives houses and rabbits is the
most accurate calendar on earth

They walk forward toward the giant pyramid

Beside the cue stands a small building its painted entrance is a
dragons mouth with sharp fangs that drip blood

The Spaniards stare through the doormouth and see stacks of human
skulls Cuauhtemoc smiles speaks

MARINA
He says there are 136000 skulls
As many as 50000 have been
sacrificed in a single year

The Spaniards stand transfixed with horror

Cuauhtemoc gestures and they begin to climb the cue Cuauhtemoc stays
below staring after them with undisguised contempt Moctezuma waits
for the Spaniards at the top

DIAZ (VO)

We realized this tour had been a
warning If we were not Gods we
should know we were dealing with an
advanced - and lethal -
civilization

As they climb the cue something is thrown off the top
The Spaniards exchange looks What was that

After a moment the distant action is repeated a human body breast
ripped open and dripping blood sails down the steps

Down below butchers carve the
bodies Arms and legs are served to
warriors the rest to the lions
Cortes shoots a glance at Father Olmeda

corners It is covered with blood

He indicates a brazier with five still-beating hearts

And here we make our offerings

myself no longer I must tell
you

We see Moctezumas face as he listens and Cortes voice fades down

DIAZ (VO)

Our Captain calmly stated our
mission to convert the natives to
Christianity He also explained the
Trinity and other mysteries which
we accept on faith

Cortes voice fades up again

CORTES
So that ours is the one true God

Moctezuma nods

MOCTEZUMA
Malinche I am sure your God is
good to you So are ours to us I
do not ask you to forsake your
beliefs Please give to our people

and our Gods the same respect

Cortes glances at the brazier -

CORTES
Didnt you hear what I said
This is an abomination

FATHER OLMEDA
(quietly calmly)
Not now Captain

CORTES
These Gods are devils

As Cortes raises his voice to the Emperor several Aztec Guards move
as if to seize him

Moctezuma motions for them to desist

CORTES (CONTD)
Let us place our Virgin here and
see how your false Gods shrink from
her

As Marina translates Moctezuma shakes his head sadly and motions
for his guests to leave

MOCTEZUMA
Ihave committed a grave sacrilege
in bringing you here These Gods
make the sun shine the rain fall
and the corn grow I must now atone
for exposing them to such
blasphemy

He walks away into one of two large temples

Cortes wants to pursue him but Father Olmeda lays a calming hand on
the Captains shoulder

Malinche is this true that of the
riches I give your King he will
receive only a fifth

CORTES
Yes but -

MOCTEZUMA
And you receive an equal fifth

Cortes nods Moctezuma proceeds with mock outrage

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)
And the rest is divided among your
men

CORTES
Its true

Moctezuma stares gravely at Cortes and then bursts out

MOCTEZUMA
Youre a very clever man

He continues to laugh
No one joins him
He realizes there is tension in the air Nods gravely

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)

You have heard about 20 of your
men

CORTES
Yes

MOCTEZUMA
I hear it too with shame and
sadness I have come to think of
you as my brother and to show my

heart has good will

laughing

He motions and a gorgeous princess DONA ANA appears

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)
Iam giving you today my third
daughter to be one of your wives

For a moment Cortes is thrown off course both by the act of
generosity and the luminous beauty of this girl

CORTES
She is very beautiful

Marina dutifully translates this
CORTES (CONTD)
But that does not change what
happened There have been too many
accidents Until those who killed
my men can be brought here and
questioned you yourself must come
with us to our quarters
He watches Moctezumas face as Marina translates
Bewilderment then shock then outrage
Moctezumas eyes flash toward his GUARDS -
Because they have their eyes lowered they do not see him

As his mouth opens Velasquez de Leon and Cristobal approach with
swords drawn

There is nothing Moctezumacan do He is trapped
He lowers his eyes His body trembles with rage

MOCTEZUMA
Goas your prisoner

CORTES
As our guest

MOCTEZUMA
Is this how my kindness is
rewarded
(anger )
When did a great prince such as
myself ever leave his palace to
stay with strangers

CORTES
You will hold court there as
always Everything will be the
same

Moctezuma stares at Cortes

MOCTEZUMA
Even if I should consent to such a
degradation my subjects never
would I remain here

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Then let the barbarian die Now

Beat Moctezuma looks at Marina

Marina looks at Cortes translate

He nods and she translates

Moctezuma stares at Cortes Expressionless but thinking

Finally he smiles And stands Paradoxically he seem stronger more
imperious He gestures toward the door

MOCTEZUMA

Let us go then to the palace of my
father and see what destiny awaits

pencil

Cortes walks by Stops Looks Looks again

CORTES
What are you doing

YOUNG DIAZ
Making notes So I can remember

CORTES
For what purpose

YOUNG DIAZ
So I can tell my grandchildren

Cortes stares at him Not with thought but with a kind of
realization A mystical moment

CORTES
No So you can tell the world

That is if you live
He laughs and walks away

Young Diaz looks after him then looks down again at his notes But
now hes looking at them in a different way

Moctezuma on his mat stroking his python Surrounding him are five
PAPAS In the center is a statue of a grotesque Aztec God

DIAZ (VO)

We kept our word Outwardly nothing

changed except the location of

Moctezumas court
Across the vast room Cortes chats with Sandoval as Marina watches
Something about the posture of the Aztecs their ritualized movements
and attitudes is dissonant unsettling impenetrable A SERVANT
interrupts their conference and Moctezuma glares at him

The Servant says something more and Moctezumas expression softens
He nods

In response ANOTHER PAPA enters carrying a dead golden eagle

When he sees this Moctezuma growls fiercely and the entering Papa
retreats Simultaneously Cuauhtemoc rises and begins to speak

Cortes turns to Marina

CORTES
Whats going on

She shakes her head watching intently as
Cuauhtemoc argues with considerable passion

CORTES (CONTD)
You cant possibly hear them

She makes no reply watches
Moctezuma gestures and Cuauhtemoc bows starts for the door -

They are taught perfect elocution
You can read their lips

Follow Cuauhtemoc and arrest him
Sandoval starts after Cuauhtemoc motioning to SEVERAL SOLDIERS to
accompany him Cuauhtemoc is still visible down the long hallway and
we see the Spaniards quickly closing in for the arrest
Cortes looks at Marinahesitates

CORTES (CONTD)
Im going to sleep with Moctezumas
daughter tonight

MARINA
She is young and pretty

CORTES
Youre not jealous

MARINA
Dont insult me

Cortes looks her over as if for the first time profound admiration

CORTES
You are remarkable

MARINA
No But I am here first and I will
bear your child
He stares

CORTES
Oh

Beat

MARINA
Youre not happy

CORTES
Im always happy

He doesnt look it

He realizes some other response is required

CORTES (CONTD)
And I am proud to have you as the
mother of my child
(intense to himself)
May it be a son
Hardly the reaction she wanted As she swallows her disappointment

Aztecs watch in bewilderment as Spaniards pile wood and weapons
(spears arrows lances) in the center of the square

DIAZ (VO)

A few days later those who killed
20 of our men were brought to
Tenochtitlan

Seventeen bound Aztecs are led out of Axayacatls Palace and tied to
the top of the wood pile

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
According to Cortes they said they
were acting on Moctezumas orders
The Aztecs claimed we
misunderstood

As Mexican pedestrians look on in astonishment Moctezuma is led onto
a balcony in shackles

His eyes are lowered in shame
The pyre is lit

The condemned men start to burn
Moctezuma watches

Cortes steps to Moctezumas side

Moctezuma senses him but does not look at him

MOCTEZUMA
Soyou sacrifice your enemies
after all

Cortes blinks

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)
Iwas talking to your priest He
tells me your God commanded Abraham
to sacrifice his son Isaac
(finally looks at Cortes)
And was not Jesus himself
sacrificed by your God

Hold on Cortes reaction -

CUT TO
INT SPANISH QUARTERS DAY

Cortes and Moctezuma play an Aztec dice game throwing smooth gold
pellets and slabs across the room The two men seem cheerful
relaxed the best of friends

DIAZ (VO)

Moctezuma was unchained after the
burnings and he was different Was
he hiding something Waiting He
seemed to have a hidden faith that
somehow his Gods would release him
from this indignity

A brief pause in the game We catch Moctezuma staring at Cortes The
look on his face is completely inscrutable

CUT TO

EXT TENOCHTITLAN STREETS DAY

Cortes and Marina walking with Cristobal and Alvarado behind them
The streets are crowded with Indians who keep glancing in one
direction as if waiting for something

DIAZ (VO)

We enjoyed the city We relaxed
And every time we did we saw
something that chilled our hearts

CRISTOBAL
No no no I dont think there is -
or should be - any limit to the
number of women a man can have In
Arabia -

They stop A noise A procession approaching
The Aztecs around them start to weep

ALVARADO
What What is it

The Spaniards group together watching as

Six Children are borne through the streets They are weeping
profusely

The Aztec pedestrians are weeping with equal abandon

MARINA
They believe the tears of the
children bring rain so the crops
will grow

CRISTOBAL
Thenthis is theatre

No
The children are sacrificed
All the Spaniards stare in disbelief

Two Aztec clowns are putting on a raucous performance

Moctezuma in full finery sits on his mat next to Cortes With a wave
of his hand he dismisses the clowns and turns to Cortes

MOCTEZUMA
Now I have a surprise for you

He motions again and AZTEC PRINCES come forward and proffer gifts

CORTES
What is this

MOCTEZUMA

What you asked Our chiefs are
declaring loyalty to King Carlos

The line of chiefs goes on across the room and out the doorand the
riches they hold are staggering

CUT TO
INT CHAPEL DAY

The treasure room door has been reopened and Spanish troops are
bringing out the booty Fully displayed it is even more dazzling
Cortes Page is noting everything with its value in a book

DIAZ (VO)

Moctezuma also told us of the
secret treasure room and freely
gave us its contents

Some of the loot is being carried through the room out onto
A LARGE ROOF TERRACE

Where the stones are being removed from the exquisite gold jewelry
and the gold melted down into ingots

DIAZ (VO)

We melted down their jewelry so
the gold would be easier to
transport

INT RECEPTION ROOM (NOTE THAT ALL ROOMS LOOK ALIKE)

Moctezuma and Cortes sit on mats examining the treasure as it is
piled before them Again Cortes Page takes notes

DIAZ (VO)
Perhaps Moctezuma hoped if we had
all his wealth we would go home

Moctezuma watches as Cortes argues quietly with Velasquez De Leon

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
But why Weve conquered Mexico
Their power revenues and loyalty
have been given us without a single
blow being struck

CORTES
Do we seek only power riches
(turning to Moctezuma)
My Lord there is one more thing I
must ask

MOCTEZUMA
Iwill grant it

CORTES
My men are not content with our
chapel We beg permission to remove
your Gods from the top of the
pyramid and put our Lady in their
place

Moctezuma stares at Cortes

MOCTEZUMA
Do you love war

Cortes is taken aback -

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)
My Gods and my people will rise

CORTES
Even one temple might do
Besideswe will take it
regardless of your answer

Moctezuma stares at Cortes

cheeks terrible eyes girdled with hissing snakes

Cortes extends his hand An iron bar is placed in it

CORTES

He leaps onto the idol and begins SMASHING it This is no simple
demolition This is RAGE FURY MADNESS

At first others join in but the pace and intensity of their leaders
assault distracts them They stop and stare

At Father Olmedas side Velasquez de Leon shakes his head

FATHER OLMEDA
Yes This goes beyond faith

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Perhapsthe slaughter in Cholula
burning those people alive Does
he feel some remorse

FATHER OLMEDA
No This is about his greatness

Cortes anger is both scary and awe-inspiring

accept himself as a gift from God

stood side by side in peace

INTERCUT the two ceremonies
- Father Olmeda waving incense

- Aztecs waving incense as they lead a BEAUTIFUL BOY 19 up the
steps of the pyramid He is surrounded by gorgeous YOUNG WOMEN

For the past year this beautiful
boy had been fed the most exquisite
food tended to by the most

of the baby Jesus surrounded by Joseph and Mary

- The Beautiful Boy walks onto the sacrificial stone and raises his
arms in exultation The Aztecs cheer

held by four Papas The Chief Papa raises his knife

- Father Olmeda begins communion On the crucifix Jesus grimacing
- Smile on the face of the Beautiful Boy
- This Crucifix is gory A spear lances Jesus chest blood gushes

- The sacrificial knife cuts blood flowing from the Beautiful Boys
chest The rich red liquid flows off the stone into a cup

- Red wine in Father Olmedas cup as he holds it to Cortes lips

The palpitating heart is placed in the brazier
- The wafer is put into Cortes mouth

- The Beautiful Boys body is thrown down the side of the Pyramid to
the Butchers who wait below The Crowds cheer happily

- Communion continues soberly feasting on the body of Christ
Moctezuma watches from the rear as Cortes walks up the aisle

He steps in Cortes path -
Cortes looks at him with surprise how dare you interrupt my mass
MOCTEZUMA

At least we kill and eat our

enemies even our selvesbut

not our Gods
He laughs derisively and walks away

INT SPANISH QUARTERS MOCTEZUMAS COURT DAY

Through the window we see the square filled with protesting Aztecs
incited by a group of Papas Drawing back inside

Moctezuma sits surrounded by enraged Priests His attitude and
posture tell us that his power has returned

On the mat in front of him is a pile of green wilted corn bad omen

MOCTEZUMA
The Gods are outraged
The People are in arms
Leave at once or you will die

CORTES
My Lord we would be pleased to go
but have no means As you know our
ships were rotten and had to be
sunk

MOCTEZUMA
(smiles)
But - how lucky - new ships have
arrived

He unfolds an Aztec scroll which shows several large vessels

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)
aniards

Cortes stares at the scroll
CORTES
Blessed be the Redeemer for his
mercies Can you tell from this
scroll how many men have come

MOCTEZUMA
Thirteen hundred

CORTES
And who is their leader

MOCTEZUMA
A man named Narvaez

Cortes stares at Moctezuma
CORTES
If you knows his name then your
men made contact with him

Moctezuma stares at Cortes and then very slowly smiles

CORTES (CONTD)

CRISTOBAL
Screw history Narvaez has fresh
men fresh horses -

SANDOVAL
And if Moctezuma is in contact with
him they must have made a deal

CORTES

Yes Moctezuma has waited
patiently with great confidence
for the tide to shift And now it
has

(long beat)
We have only one advantage

They both expect us to lose

A foot soldier tiring pats the leg of a horseman and they trade
places

Speed was our only ally surprise
our only weapon

Suddenly the company stops peers into a deep ravine They look in
both directions the ravine finally closes miles away

CRISTOBAL OLID
Horses can be round in an hour but
those on foot will lose half a day

Cortes shakes his head no good He stares at the ravine 25 feet
wide no way to cross it

CORTES
Send the horses on

The others look at him skeptically He addresses Sandoval

CORTES (CONTD)
Go

Sandoval kicks his horse and the other four ride after him

CRISTOBAL OLID
But how do we cross

CORTES
I dont know

CRISTOBAL OLID
You dont - (know Are you
crazy

CORTES
Some kind of bridge

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
But what would we make it of

Again Cortes looks up and down the ravine

CORTES
Maybe the bridge is already here

A HUNDRED YARDS AWAY
They stare at a huge sycamore tree five feet in diameter
CRISTOBAL OLID
With swords It would take half a
day to cut it down

Cortes shakes his head Cristobal doesnt get it

Then Cristobal follows Cortes gazeup into the branches of the
tree

A hundred feet off the ground the branches approach those of a

sister tree from the other side of the ravine
Cristobal gives Cortes a look are you criminally insane

CORTES
Volunteers

None Just as he expected
He starts to climb the tree

CRISTOBAL OLID
Youre not scared of heights

CORTES
No
Its falling from heights I dont
like

MINUTES LATER

Cortes climbing quickly

Too quickly He grabs a branch where wet leaves are resting -
Loses his grip -

Plunges six feet landing on another branch with terrific force
almost falling to his death

He lies there Heaves a big sigh Calls to those below

CORTES
Just a few ribs

Starts to climb again
As he does the wind comes up and the branches begin to sway
Down below Cristobal watches with Velasquez de Leon

CRISTOBAL OLID
If he falls we can return to Cuba

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
To hell with Cuba

Cristobal looks surprised at his vehemence

VELASQUEZ DE LEON (CONTD)
Stop your whining
You have five women a fortune in
gold and youre having the time of
your life

and

CRISTOBAL OLID
True enough

But I can complain if I want to

Cortes nears the top Ties a rope to the tree hes in

The wind is strong The pinnacle swaying back and forthbranches
approaching the sister tree then pulling away

Approachingpulling away
Cortes has to make his leap at precisely the right instant
Hes terrified Prepares to leap then stops himself Realizing

CORTES
If youre scared youll fall

He takes a deep breath

Looks down at the others

Waves Grins This is not a moment for sanity
He looks back at the waving trees

CORTES (CONTD)
What the hell

Rope tied to his waist he rocks with the tree preparing to jump -
Velasquez de Leon crosses himself

Cortes SCREAMS at the top of his lungs LEAPS -

Fails to catch his branch -

Falls

Grabs another branch which breaks his fall but cant hold on -

Falls again and finally latches on two hands gripping tight Tendons
white sick grimace on his face

He closes his eyes with relief made it
MINUTES LATER
The rope is now strung from the top of the first tree to where Cortes

landed in the second so that others can traverse the ravine without
jumping The last man Cristobal moves gingerly across

CORTES
Hurry the horses

Dust in the distance
100 YARDS AWAY MINUTES LATER

As the horses ride up the foot soldiers wait directly across from
where Sandoval left them The sycamore trees sway in the distance

Alvarado believed the Mexicans were
about to attack He struck first
during one of their festivals and
slaughtered them The entire city
is now counter-attacking our

Cortes stares at him thoughtfully

CORTES
Perhaps this was Moctezumas plan
with Narvaez Divide and conquer

SANDOVAL

into camp

When the Sentry turns back he sees two clusters of men walking

casually Cortes waves to the Sentry and calls

CORTES

The Sentry waves to them -

PULL BACK OUT of the tent focus on

As they spot the light from Narvaez tent and stealthily approach
the pyramid Sandoval and four other men run up the steps from the

other direction Suddenly nearby voices call

VOICES
To arms Were being attacked

Cortes and his men raise their muskets and fire
Other rifles go off simultaneously
Sandovals group sprints up the cue

Narvaezs men rush from their tents fumbling with their rifles and
are quickly taken prisoner

CORTES
Cortes Victory to Cortes

His men take up the chant reloading their rifles and firing them
into the air -

INSIDE HIS TENT

Narvaez trying to untangle himself from his amorous lover Grabbing
for some kind of clothing -

OUTSIDE
From every side Cortes men are firing into the air
Meanwhile fireflies are blinking in the distance
Narvaezs men hear the musket shots see the fireflies
DIAZ (VO)
Narvaez men mistook the blinking
fireflies for our muskets and
thought we had somehow mustered a

huge force

Cortes and Sandoval from opposite sides are climbing the cue Hand-
to-hand combat

They reach the top as a silhouette in a nightshirt runs from his tent
out into the darkness and is attacked from two sides He clutches his
face -

NARVAEZ
Santa Maria help me They have
killed me and put out my eye

Down below Cortes men take up the chant Narvaez is dead The cry
echoes across the camp

He offers his hand imperiously for them to kiss

humiliation was completed in the

forces

Narvaez sits nearby He is now wearing an eye patch

NARVAEZ
Thank your evil luck for putting me
into your power so easily

CORTES
I have much to be thankful for but
this is the least of my
achievements

Cortes gives each of Narvaez men a small sack At a moment when no-
one else is in hearing Cortes explains to Sandoval

CORTES (CONTD)
The gold is to keep these
mercenaries from having second
thoughts

Nearby two of Cortes men - Villafana (a common soldier with a

distinctive scar who we saw on the docks in Cuba) and his COHORT
watch with barely concealed rage

SANDOVAL
But our own men have received
nothing These gifts will -

CORTES
Exactly
(to Villafana and Cohort)
What sort of soldiers follow a man
like Narvaez Do they fight for
glory or God No Only for gold

VILLAFANA
I am the same

CORTES
Good You shall have the gold you
dream of

(giving him asmall sack)

Lots of it And we shall use these
(indicates Narvaez men)

cousins of ours to get it

A SOLDIER on horseback rides up furiously hands Cortes a message
Sandoval watches as Cortes reads the message with grave concern -

SANDOVAL

Like a neutron bomb landed No Indians in sight

Some of the bridges which connected other dikes have been destroyed
Clear implication the Spaniards will have to fight their way out

SANDOVAL
P-perhaps the last message we
received was a trick
As they cross one of the bridges a horse falls

The caravan stops

Cortes trots back to examine the animal Leg broken it will have to
be destroyed

Botello the exotic little man who was throwing tarot on the ship
mutters something Cortes glowers in his direction

CORTES
What did you say

BOTELLO
I dont care if you hate me I
speak the truth This is a bad
omen
CORTES
In a deserted city you need a
spastic horse to tell you something
is wrong
Botello gestures derisively and retreats
Cortes stares at the horse

Cortes looks anxiously toward Tenochtitlan

Silence Cortes begins to fidget He and Sandoval exchange
another look

Finally we hear a shot fired in reply
Cortes spurs his horse and they move on
CUT TO
EXT MAIN SQUARE DAY
Cortes and his men enter

The square is empty except FOUR MEXICA each standing in a corner
dripping blood

Cortes and company look at the Mexica with mounting horror as they
realize

The reason they drip blood is because they are wearing the skins of
slaughtered men

Cortes turns to Marina

CORTES
This is intended to scare us

MARINA
No Its one of their rituals
The Ceremony of the Flayed Men
Cortes nods Stares again at the four men

Barely overcoming his horror he kicks his horse and moves on

Alvarado rushes out to meet him

CORTES
How are your troops

ALVARADO
No food No water

Moctezuma is approaching

Cortes dismounts and walks right past him

On Moctezumas face rage then sadness confusion and again rage
MOCTEZUMA

Is this the reward I get for

calling off my men and preventing
the slaughter of yours

CORTES
You prefer to kill us slowly
cutting off food and water

MOCTEZUMA

Iam helpless to change these
things when I am your captive

CORTES
Arent you the Great Moctezuma

Long beat They stare at each other

MOCTEZUMA

If you wish our markets reopened

you must release my nephew
Cuauhtemoc

He hates all Spaniards

MOCTEZUMA

He is married to my youngest
daughter he is in line for the
throne and he will obey the

emperor

Cortes considers this finally turns to De Leon

CORTES
Order it done
(stares at Moctezuma)
When I was gone why did you save
my men
(off Moctezumas stare)
You feared for your life

MOCTEZUMA
The greatest honor for a warrior is

to die in combat May that be my
fate

CORTES
Then why

MOCTEZUMA

Because you Cortes are a most
remarkablebeing

It seems an unequivocal statement of admiration and awe Then

walks across the square

As Cuauhtemoc passes TWO WOMEN they lower their eyes deferentially
They will not look at his face

Cortes frowns what does this mean

ALVARADO (0S) (CONTD)
So you see I had no choice

CORTES
(whirls)
Choice This was their festival
during which they NEVER wage war

ALVARADO
I caught them by surprise -

CORTES
They outnumber us a thousand to
one The one thing you were not to
do was provoke their wrath

ALVARADO
Yes sir

CORTES
You are a great soldier Alvarado
with the brain of a crustacean
When we return to battle you will
fight in the most precarious
position

ALVARADO
(grins)
Sounds good to me

CORTES
Get out of here

Alvarado leaves
Cortes stares after him Then he looks again out the window
Cuauhtemoc no longer visible Just a few Aztecs

CORTES (CONTD)
I should have left Velasquez de
Leon in charge

We think hes talking to an empty room

CORTES (CONTD)
Hes the only man I have whos not

Marina approaches him At her touch his speech becomes gentler more
affectionate

CORTES (CONTD)
But the children are so simple

always slept on the floor in my
clothes I grew used to it and for
years after I never lay down ina
bed unless there was a woman in it

A commotion nearby soldiers run and shout Diaz does not wake until

A flaming arrow pierces the air and lands on Young Diaz bedroll It
bursts into flames

He leaps up and stamps it out
Around him other soldiers jump to arms -

As Cortes and Marina approach Moctezuma stands watching the battle
and stroking his python

MOCTEZUMA

It is my shame I am here with you
and not there leading my people

CORTES
Who is the warrior who leads them

MOCTEZUMA
(knowing the answer)
Where

Cortes points to a dynamic Chieftain exhorting his troops

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)
You dont recognize my nephew
Cuauhtemoc who you just released

CORTES
You told me he would open the
markets

MOCTEZUMA
He has To our people

CORTES
You said he would obey the emperor

MOCTEZUMA
He does

As of now he is the emperor
Enraged Cortes stalks out of the room -

Father Olmeda with Moctezuma
DIAZ (VO)
Their love of death terrified us
so we appealed to Moctezuma to end
the bloodshed
MOCTEZUMA
I desire only to die
FATHER OLMEDA
(gently)
But must all your people and ours
die with you
Moctezuma stares at him
FATHER OLMEDA (CONTD)
Allow us to leave in peace and we
will never return
Long beat
Moctezuma stares at Father Olmeda
MOCTEZUMA
Iunderstand more than you think
Father Olmeda is about to question this enigmatic reply when

Moctezuma walks onto a rooftop dressed in his official regalia (rich
loin cloth mantle embroidered with feathers gold decorations
turquoise ear plugs a jade ornament piercing both nostrils and a
rock crystal tube piercing his lower lip His face is brightly
painted The effect is bizarre but quite beautiful)

Hes surrounded and protected by Spaniards

The Aztecs stop fighting but their attitude toward Moctezuma has
changed its still respectful but for the first time they look
directly at his face

MOCTEZUMA
People my people who I love brave
people why are you fighting
To save me
Iam not a prisoner I am already
dead

Marina translating for Cortes

CORTES
Alreadydead

MOCTEZUMA
Do you want to drive away the
strangers
That is not necessary If you let
them go the strangers will leave
and never return
This is their word

They give their word
Should we not believe them

CORTES
What is he doing Whats he saying

MOCTEZUMA
Have not the strangers always been
honest and true
Go home then Take the word of
these strangers and lay down your
arms Listen please Listen to your
emperor

He stops His eyes search the crowd and find Cuauhtemoc
He nods to Cuauhtemoc
Cortes sees it
CUAUHTEMOC
I am the Emperor now Listen to me

This man is a coward

A rising swell of anger as other Aztecs shout similar insults Cortes
is enraged at this carefully staged piece of theatre

MARINA
(to Cortes)
They are calling him a eunuch an
old woman a sodomite for the white
men

Cuauhtemoc fires an arrow at Moctezuma Barely misses Other Aztecs
shoot arrows throw stones and hurl insults -

Moctezuma stands proudly accepting even welcoming the abuse

The Spaniards Guards taken by surprise rush to protect him but -
Moctezuma is hit on the chest by two stones -

The giant Tzilacatzin fires his slingshot

And hits Moctezuma on the head He drops -

Spanish Guards hurriedly cover him up and carry him inside
INT PALACE DAY

As Moctezuma is carried in he is brought past a glaring Cortes
Moctezuma looks up at him with a wan smile of triumph

He is then carried into the adjoining room

Cortes glares after him with homicidal fury then follows him into
the other room The door closes slowly ominously

Hold on the door In the bg we HEAR THE BATTLE RAGING

Before your soul is damned -

MOCTEZUMA

No My Gods have forsaken me but I
will not forsake them

He indicates Father Olmeda who at the moment is examining with
evident greed a beautiful gold necklace

When Cortes turns back Moctezuma gives him his hand

MOCTEZUMA (CONTD)

Malinche My daughters sweet and
fiery are here with you Will you

protect them

CORTES
(touched)
Of course
(hesitates cant resist
asking )
And you can you tell me They
say you were once a great warrior
(off Moctezumas nod)
Why did you never fight us

Moctezuma smiles as if to say Dont you know

MOCTEZUMA
If you were a God I dared not If
youwere what you say ambassador
to a great King

What kind of King would I be if I
made war on an ambassador

(breathing more heavily)
Besides we Mexica fight wars to
gain captives

(gestures)

Here in Tenochtitlan are you not
already our prisoner

Cortes stares at him stunned

Moctezuma smiles wanly

Cortes realizing suddenly has Moctezuma already defeated him
Moctezumas breath getting shorter and shorter

The Page watches as

Cortes closes Moctezumas eyes

INT THE NEXT ROOM

As Cortes Page finishes this story

YOUNG DIAZ
Is that really what happened

CORTES PAGE
Of course

YOUNG DIAZ
Butwhen he left here Cortes
seemed enraged at Moctezuma

Cortes Page stares at Young Bernal Diaz with a peculiar expression
and we realize the Pages story may be a lie

Their attention is diverted by the sound of the raging battle -
CUT TO
INT SPANISH QUARTERS DAY

At a barricaded doorway soldiers are firing reloading and firing

again without aiming their shotguns and crossbows the Indians so
thickly massed the Spaniards cant miss

Botello the Soothsayer stands waiting as Cortes paces the floor
listening to the anxious report of

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
-handful of corn per day Without
food and clean water well never
last the week

CORTES
(turns to Botello)
You were right about the horses
death

BOTELLO
As always

CORTES
If I seek your counsel am I no
better than Moctezuma whose world
is cursed by superstition

BOTELLO
(snide)
A pretty question sir Shall I
consult the stars for an answer

CORTES
(irritable)
What is your augury now For us

BOTELLO
Leave tomorrow night or die

Cortes nods thoughtfully and glances across the room where
CARPENTERS are building some kind of contraption

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
(supporting Botello)
The Indians are still unprepared
for night battle so perhaps -
BOTELLO
Its not military tactics its
fate
CORTES
(growls)
Fate is something we cause not
submit to
Father Olmeda arches an eyebrow at Cortes

CORTES (CONTD)
With Gods mercy of course

FATHER OLMEDA
Of course

CUT TO
EXT AXAYACATLS CASTLE DAY
Battle raging

The front doors swing open and FOUR MEXICAN PRINCES carry out a body
wrapped in turquoise cloth

The battle stops
The body is borne with great solemnity Indian drums roll
Soldiers on both sides stand silently in tribute

Even those Aztecs who cursed and threw stones now give Moctezuma
respect let us forget failings and honor the dead

DIAZ (VO)
Some say they gave Moctezumas body
royal honors

The huge room where Moctezuma once held court is now the military
command room Cortes and the other Hidalgos are diagramming plans for
their departure A Messenger is given final instructions and
departs

DIAZ (VO)

We had to flee To camouflage our
true intentions we sent a message
asking Cuauhtemoc for peace

Cortes Page opens the door and fifty Soldiers rush in Across the
room is a pile all the treasure the Spaniards have accumulated The
Soldiers dig greedily through these riches

CORTES PAGE
In all it is worth 700000 pesos
Cortes says Take what you can But
remember he goes safest at night
who travels lightest

The men scarcely hear him theyre stuffing their shirts with heavy
gold ingots

Across the room the war council continues

ALVARADO
But Cortes wants me in the most
precarious place which is the
rear

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Then I must fight there too
(to Alvarado)
With due respect we cannot survive
another error in judgement

Alvarado turns toward Cortes and smiles with defiant charm
ALVARADO
Well Youre the Captain of the
Captains

Cortes lowers his eyes and says sadly to Velasquez de Leon

CORTES
We gratefully accept your offer

CUT TO

INT SPANISH QUARTERS NIGHT

The men pack their bags and prepare for battle

CORTES PAGE
Two hours to departure Two
hours

Alvarados warming up like a boxer shoving the wall grunting
psyching himself up

Cristobal holds hands with two of his WIVES as two others massage his
feet

Sandoval tests the blade of his sword

Velasquez De Leon sits in a corner Cervantes (the blond buffoon who
Cortes found long ago sleeping on his watch) walks past -

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Hey You Cervantes

CERVANTES
Sir

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
I have no one to drink with me
Will you -

CERVANTES
(big grin)
Shouldnt be a problem sir

Velasquez de Leon hands Cervantes his bota (leather winebag)
Cervantes hoists it and sprays a stream into his mouth Or mostly
into his mouth he spills some onto his armor

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
The wine is Castilian Ive been
nursing it the whole trip

Velasquez de Leon retrieves the bota and drinks himself Elegantly

Lowers the baglooks at Cervantes

VELASQUEZ DE LEON (CONTD)
Are you in the rear

CERVANTES
Tonights battle No sir To be
honest Im something of a coward
and I want to get out of here as
quick as I can

Cervantes glances at the wine hoping for another drink

Velasquez de Leon hands him the bag

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
Could you carry this for me Youll
have a better chance of getting it
through

CERVANTES
No problem sir No problem at all
And I promise I will not touch
another drop On my honor

He bows obsequiously and saunters away with the bota

Velasquez de Leon stares His face - placid on the surface - is
sad underneath that we cant bear to look at it

We glide to where Villafana and his Cohort who complained when
Narvaez men received gold are whispering conspiratorially

DIAZ (VO)
On this night most of us knew we
could only survive united But in
the whole campaign we never took a
step forward without being
sabotaged from the rear

Were now close enough to overhear

VILLAFANA
»well only reach Cuba if Cortes
dies

VILLAFANAS COHORT
You wouldnt strike at him

Villafana shakes his head

VILLAFANAS COHORT (CONTD)
Even in battle

VILLAFANA
Especially in battle
But in battle sometimes a mans
virtues do him in
His Cohort is puzzled As Villafana leans forward to explain -
CUT TO
INT CORTES CHAMBERS NIGHT

Cortes sleeping Marina gently rubbing his head

She stops looks at him

so

Hes spread out on the bed shirt open Indian feathers scattered

around as if having been incorporated in their love-making

Something momentous in her stoic face

She undoes her huipil and we see her rounded belly five months
along but very large

Slowly solemnly she ties his shirt-tail to the tail of her huipil
She places his sleeping hand over the knot

Puts her own hand over his (From this Aztec ritual comes the saying
tie the knot)

Sandoval knocks sticks his head in

SANDOVAL
Twenty minutes to midnight

Marina nods While the unwitting groom slept through the
ceremony the brides face streams with tears

CUT TO
EXT AXAYACATLS PALACE NIGHT
The doors swing silently open

DIAZ (VO)

This was to be the most famous
battle in our campaign

It came to be called noche
triste the sad night

Two Spaniards exit look around -
The Square totally deserted

The Two Men motion and 40 more emerge carrying an enormous platform
(the structure we saw being constructed)

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We chose the shortest causeway The
bridges had been removed so we
built a mobile one to carry from
one section to the next

The platform is followed by foot soldiers cavalry women and
porters the Tlascalan allies and finally the rear guard featuring
Velasquez de Leon and Alvarado

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
It was dark A fine mist obscured
and muffled our departure
They enter the dike
DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
By some miracle or by ineptitude
the Aztecs had posted no guards

The portable bridge is put in place and they start across it -

The land seems such a short distance away

Cortes stares hoping can they really escape without a battle
On the shore AN AZTEC WOMAN fetching water from the lake

She sees them

Stands

Whistles

A beat then answering whistles

And more Like menacing birds -

The Spaniards race across the portable bridge -

Pirogues (the Mexican canoes) stream toward them The white tunics of
the Aztecs seem eerie ghostlike

Everyone has crossed the portable bridge The PORTERS try to lift it
but it wont budge

The great huehuetl (drum) on top of the Templo Mayor SOUNDS (and
keeps sounding throughout the battle) At that instant

Pirogues arrive Spaniards are showered with arrows and stones

Suddenly on a rooftop the majestic Cuauhtemoc Motionless Staring
Then he thrusts two spears into the air At this signal

Enemy soldiers appear everywhere On land on the causeway the
Spaniards are headed toward As if the Indians were always there but
only now can be seen Shouting whistling banging drums

The portable bridge just wont budge The Porters fall dead under
the Indian onslaught

Word spreads among the Spaniards The bridge wont move

Pandemonium Panic Men dive into the water and swim only to find
themselves helpless against the Indian clubs stones arrows -

Cavalry plunge into the water and fare little better
Men who cannot swim grab a horses tail and try to hitch a ride

An Indian climbs onto the dike grabs a soldier they tumble back
into the water The Spaniard helpless among so many enemies is
quickly carried away Suddenly we recognize the captive It is
Cervantes the buffoon with the blond beard

Cuauhtemoc himself is everywhere doing battle directing the other
Caciques spreading the spirit of victory CAMERA MOVES IN ON him
Handsome confident full of fury this man is a leader
DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Watching Cuauhtemoc we were
overcome by a sense of familiarity
he was Moctezumas blood He
resembled Moctezuma It was as if
Moctezuma himself Moctezuma the
warrior had finally come forth to
fight us in the form of
Cuauhtemoc

Hold on Cuauhtemoc as this idea this eerie resemblance strikes our
emotions Then the noise of gunfire distracts us

Two Spaniards fire their guns sinking canoes and leap into the
lake They hold their weapons and gunpowder above water -

This posture makes swimming difficult and defense impossible They
are forced to drop their rifles and fight for their lives

Up ahead another Spaniard climbs out of the lake and tries to fire
his gun click With wet gunpowder the weapon is useless

The Indian that The Spaniard fired atcaptures him

And Young Bernal Diaz is fighting frantically hopelessly for his
life He looks like a boy trying to do a mans work

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
For the second time I knew I would
die We all knew it I was hardly
wrong

Young Diaz miraculously escapes for the moment from three Indians

A few feet away the giant Tzilacatzin pulls back his slingshot and
knocks a Spaniard off his horse

Two Spaniards fire crossbows at him -

Hit him

He laughs pulls the arrows out of his cloth armor and digs for
another stone

Though there is panic among the Spaniards the chief hidalgos -
Cortes Sandoval etc - are keeping their composure

Some Spaniards seem sluggish When they run it looks like slow-
motion When they hit the water they sink Either way they die

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Those who had loaded themselves
with gold this night fulfilled a
life-long dream they died rich

We see Villafana Sneaky eyes

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
And even in such extremity petty
plots unfolded

Villafana is guarding Marina Butis it possiblehe seems to be
very subtly guiding her away from safety

As we see this Villafanas Cohort grabs Cortes arm and yells
something Points at Marina

Cortes sees her Her swollen belly Swollen with his child Without
hesitation he hurtles toward her into the heart of the Indian army
We realize this is his virtue doing him in

In this moment through the insane intensity of his rage we see
clearly how much Cortes loves his Indian mistress

And she knows it Sees it Though her features as always seem
impassive it touches her to see Cortes passion made manifest

As Cortes frees her they exchange a look An acknowledgement

Then Villafana himself watching Cortes is seized from the rear and
dragged toward the water

VILLAFANA
My Captain Cortes

Cortes sees him jumps from his horse

And is immediately surrounded by Indians

Villafana scurries free as all the Mexicans concentrate on Cortes
They grab his limbs knock his sword to the ground -

He yells writhes punches but theyre dragging him toward the water

Tzilacatzin grabs him
Holds him aloft and laughs Is everything lost

No Cristobal De Olid is tearing toward Cortes Like a tractor
steaming through heavy grass he cuts a swath through the enemy

DIAZ (VO)

Whatever you say of Cristobal de
Olid in battle he was a veritable
Hector It is strange but I swear
I never saw another man fight with
such bravery

The sight of Cristobal - and certain death - forces Tzilacatzin to
drop Cortes -

Cristobal throws Cortes a sword Cortes fights as

Cristobal and Tzilacatzin begin a private battle of wills

Sandoval is also moving toward Cortes bringing an extra horse
An Aztec jabs at Cortes head Blood bursts forth
Sandoval arrives and Cortes lurches up onto the extra horse -
Villafana watching from safety curses in disgust

As Cortes mounts the horse he sees His Page being carried off ina
canoe The Pages eyes fixed on his master

CORTES
My page

Sandoval prevents Cortes from plunging his horse into the water

Enraged Cortes tears his eyes off his Page and spurs his horse into
a swarm of Indians cutting them down with savage intensity He and
Sandoval are among the last Spaniards on this section of the dike
They pass Velasquez de Leon and Alvarado bravely keeping the rear
and drive their horses into the water

Ahead of them Marina and Two Spaniards have commandeered a canoe and
- accompanied by Dona Ana - are gliding to safety

Suddenly drums

And fire in the distance

From the main temple Spaniards being led up the side With horror we
recognize Cervantes in the lead

For a moment the battle ceases and everyone on both sides watches -
in horror or triumph - as the familiar ritual is enacted

Cervantes is thrown onto the sacrificial stone

Held down

His chest is cut open

His heart is held aloft for all to see

His body is thrown callously down the side of the pyramid

The Spaniards turn from the sight in shock and redouble their efforts
at escape Now more than ever they are motivated by fear

But scarcely have the Spanish begun anew scarcely have Cortes and
Sandoval reach the next segment of causeway when a new sound comes
a pure piercing note

The Indians raise their arms in triumph the Spanish turn and see

Cuauhtemoc blowing his conch shell A tremulous e sharp

The Indians renew their attack with a fury close to insanity
Cuauhtemocs horn is apparently a mandate to kill capture or die
in the attempt

As Cortes and Sandoval try to ward off the homicidal rage we swing
back to

Alvarado and Velasquez de Leon protecting the rear as the last
Spaniards enter the water The two men fight side by side with
vastly different styles - Velasquez precise and aristocratic
Alvarado a fountain of almost homicidal fury - yet we sense between
them teamwork comradeship and at last mutual respect

Seeing everyone else has gone

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
After you

ALVARADO
Get in the water you fool

VELASQUEZ DE LEON
(grins)
Together then
(glances at Alvarado)
At my signal
The glance the camraderie costs him
As his eyes are averted a stone hits him on the forehead
Tzilacatzin raises his arms in triumph -

Velasquez de Leon falls Alvarado leans over him -

VELASQUEZ DE LEON (CONTD)
Save yourself

Theyre beset by Indians

But Alvarado fights the Aztecs off with one arm as he hoists
Velasquez de Leon onto his back

Tzilacatzin keeps firing stones which Alvarado somehow deflects with
his sword

For a few moments like some mythological warrior Alvarado holds
twenty men at bay with one arm

But his load is too heavy He cant continue the swirling motions
which protect his wounded comrade

As Alvarados movements slow an Indian leaps from behind and aiming
for Alvarado hits Velasquez de Leon on the back of the head

Velasquez de Leons legs stiffen shudderand relax

Alvarado roars with rage

He drops Velasquez de Leons body and goes on the attack
Again he drives the enemy back but how long can he keep this up

The water which separates him from the next section of causeway is
filled with canoes Impossible to swim it

He turns on his attackers stabbing one tossing two into the
water But totally isolated his position appears hopeless

He sees something For no reason we can perceive he launches a
diagonal attack moving away from the water

They we see A lance lying on the ground
He fights his way to it picks it up
Too long Indians too close to him The lance is useless

He utters a blood-chilling roar and the Indians fall back for an
instant He points the lance toward the water and runs

His speed building building
Indians swiping at him as he sprints past
He reaches the water and aims the lance downward into the waves -
Like some maritime pole-vaulter he catapults himself
out over the water
over the heads of amazed Indians in canoes
shouting with the glory of his escape

And landing near the next section of causeway Indians are all around
him but theyre so amazed that they retreat He gains land

DIAZ (VO)

To the Aztecs who called Alvarado
the sun in respect for his blazing
red hair this was the most amazing
feat in all our time in New Spain
You can still find the spot in the
city of Mexico where Alvarado made
his famous leap

The scene which greets Alvarado on the next dike is terrifying Hes
literally walking on the corpses of his comrades many of whose
bodies are being sacked for gold Other Spaniards are still fighting
struggling toward the last gap in the bridge

When he himself reaches the gap it too is filled with floating
Spanish bodies Indian bodies

He slogs across this bridge of collapses dodging stones and
arrows

And reaches the last section of causeway which connects to land 200
yards ahead a small band of Spaniards is fighting bravely

Surrounding Indians pay Alvarado the courtesy of a few idle sword
thrusts but theyre primarily occupied in looting

He sprints forward and joins the rest of the group only a few
hundred men They burst through the last resistance and stagger to
land Stunned dazed exhausted

In a broad field Cortes collapses under a sycamore tree

He stares blankly Blood streams down his face

Dawn coming

Sandoval approaches wearily the boy becoming a man (NOTE from this
moment forward Sandoval no longer stutters)

SANDOVAL
The doctor must tend to your head

CORTES
(ignoring this)
What is your reckoning

SANDOVAL
We have lost most of our Indian
allies and two-thirds of our own
men

CORTES

Cortes glares and Sandoval starts reciting the dead

approaches to get the news

CORTES

Sandoval shakes his head and inspects Botellos papers which are
covered with odd markings

remaining women huddle in the middle Those who cannot walk sit on

Decrepit foot soldiers surround this nucleus
A dozen hale riders and horses circumnavigate the whole
Campfires are left burning
DIAZ (VO)
We departed at midnight leaving
our fires burning to fool the

enemy

As they begin their march a SOLDIER tied to a horse has a seizure
He shakes terribly keeps shaking but no one goes to his aid

In fact no one notices Hes not much worse off than anyone else

Walking with Cortes is Martin Lopez We overhear them discussing the
design of the brigantines

They reach agreement and Martin Lopez goes off walking past

Villafana and his Cohort lurking beside a building preparing to
attack Cortes -

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Not everyone was pleased

Cortes seems weak helpless unable to defend himself -
But just at the moment when the traitors are about to attack
Marina rushes up to Cortes holding a small infant

MARINA
Hernando He smiled

Cortes nods

MARINA (CONTD)
Look hes doing it again To you

Cortes gives the child an idle pat They turn a corner and see Dona
Ana Moctezumas daughter nursing a second infant

Cortes looks at the two women two babies

CORTES
My wife was barren now I have two
children If I allowed myself to
feel these things I would be

happy

MARINA
You do feel them

CORTES
No

MARINA

I see it
He glares at her silently then looks again toward Dona Ana
CORTES

That child is descended from both
me and Moctezuma

Another silence as Cortes stares at Dona Anas daughter
Quite impulsively Marina hands Cortes her child
To her surprise he accepts it

The infant seizes his fathers pinkie and suddenly unexpectedly
Cortes is overwhelmed by feelings of tenderness

Marina sees it For a moment her face is unguarded filled with love
and something else longing

MARINA
They saythat you will do
anything to get what you want

A strange statement in this moment what exactly is she asking

CORTES
Of course

And what is he answering
An odd silence He hands the child back

CORTES (CONTD)
I am sorry

Is he apologizing for being who he is

MARINA
I am not

He looks at the child suddenly distant from him

CORTES
If I feel this child I will feel
other things Things which may
cause me to avert my eyes in the
face of danger or suffering If I
do that even for an instant we
will all die in Mexico

MARINA
(casual)
Then feel nothing
(fiercely)
But love him with your secret
heart

She turns from him in anger and walks away
CUT TO
EXT TLASCALAN SQUARE DAY
SLOW PAN of the square A kind of picnic Spaniards lounging around

some dressed in Indian garb all eating Indian food with great
relish They are becoming assimilated
DIAZ (VO)
We stayed in Tlascala six months

We see a carpentry shop several boats under construction

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We built ships we hoped would
blockade Tenochtitlan and sent out
small expeditions which conquered
the Aztecs allies

The major hidalgos are being pampered by their harems

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We also grew used to Indian ways

As we complete the PAN of the square we find Cortes
recovered speaking to his men We dont yet hear his

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
But pleasure is married to
cowardice We faced a final mutiny
in our own midst

CORTES

(sound fading up)
-to those of you who still doubt
You told us we could never survive
our battles here in Tlascala and
you were right
You said we could not safely enter
Tenochtitlan and then leave
Tenochtitlan again you were right
You say now it is suicide to
proceed I cannot argue
By the laws of logic you have
always been right
Yet we have survived
I ask you to trust me and follow
me one last time

(long beat)
If you cannot say it now

Cortes looks over the crowd
At Cristobal

At Villafana

Neither man speaks

Cortes nods

CORTES (CONTD)
Then let us complete our miracle

The crowd cheers

will kill us

CORTES

Sandovals eyes move see a MESSENGER approaching with a package
Sandoval grunts They all rise

As they start to walk the Messenger intercepts them
MESSENGER

Captain A package has come from
Spain

CORTES
Deliver it to my tent

MESSENGER
But sire -

CORTES
Are you deaf I will open it after
my walk
He strolls through camp keeping a wary eye

Some men call a greeting others appear guilty

Villafana stands in front of his tent pretending not to look at them
He stretches and goes inside

CORTES (CONTD)
I would die for any of them

SANDOVAL
That is why they hate you

They wander toward Villafanas tent
CORTES
Then what Am I to be less than
myself
He slashes a hole in Villafanas tent and jumps
INSIDE
Villafana and his Cohort conferring -

They blink stunned -

Villafana grabs something from inside his shirt Parchment Starts to
swallow it -

Cortes snatches it as Alvarado and Sandoval seize the conspirators
Cortes stares at the parchment

Turns his back on the others
We who see his face know he has read something deeply disturbing

SANDOVAL
The names

Cortes nods Responds to the implied question

CORTES
No one of stature
Lets hope the sight of these two
scares the others into submission
(turns to Villafana)
Have you anything to say before you
die

VILLAFANA
I curse the day I met you
I curse the day I heard your name
I am put on this sweet earth one
time and I curse the God who makes
me die because of your mad dreams

CORTES
I am only mad if we lose Had you
followed me back to -
VILLAFANA
Had I followed I would still have
died but I am glad to have taken
this course I had the courage to
stand up to Hernan Cortes
Cortes stares at him
Villafana stares defiantly back
Cortes nods and Alvarado gags Villafana
CORTES

My friends we need every man This
paper did not exist
CUT TO
EXT SPANISH CAMP DAY

Great commotion The army looks on as Sandoval and Alvarado prepare
to hang Villafana and his Cohort

Cortes watches from a distance

We realize hes not watching the hanging at all hes watching
another tent

Cristobal stands in the entrance to that tent
Cortes approaches

CORTES
A sad thing

Cristobal practically jumps
Looks toward Villafana and Cohort

CRISTOBAL OLID
What did they do

CORTES
Mutiny They claimed they had 50
men but wouldnt give names

CRISTOBAL OLID
If they had

CORTES
I would hang 50
Thats why I am speaking with you
This makes Cristobal nervous
Cortes pauses proceeds
CORTES (CONTD)
You have often expressed an

eagerness to return home -

CRISTOBAL OLID
But I would never -

CORTES
Still others may come to you
Others may seek your -

CRISTOBAL OLID
If they do I1l tell them no

CORTES
If they dokill them

Cristobal nods soberly
CORTES (CONTD)
As my best soldier you are the
only man I would trust to execute
this sentence
Cristobal stares at Cortes
CRISTOBAL OLID
I wish
to God
I did not love you

This is too much Cortes spins away to keep Cristobal from seeing
his tortured face

He glances toward the gallows the hanging is imminent
He sighs Swallows

CORTES
Shall we watch

They walk toward the gallows In the distance the bodies fall and
shudder spasmodically

Gorgeous day Cortes reviewing his troops healthy eager well-
equipped Our attention goes to splendor and spectacle the size of
the force their Indian shields etc Background information

DIAZ (VO)

While we rested in Tlascala our
forces increased We seized two
ships sent by Velasquez and two
from Jamaica Everyone joined our
army

Line after line row after row this army has size

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
There was also a ship from Spain
bearing an Emissary of the Crown

Reveal from the rear the ROYAL EMISSARY beautiful robes and a bald
spot His head appears to be buried in a womans chest

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
He was a syphilitic old man who
would not eat anything except
breast milk from a woman from
Castile

We now see very plainly the old geezer is nursing His face
contented his jaw pumping away like a newborn

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We thought he perfectly represented
the bureaucracy

Cortes reaches the front of the Spanish forces

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
We had 900 Spaniards twice our
original force

Farther down the hill an endless horde of Indians

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Through conquest we had gained
200000 Indian allies The Aztecs
had no more

Cortes signals and the army begins to march A grand spectacle

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
If this were merely a story it
would end here and our victory
would seem assured
But this is truth

EXT HIGH MOUNTAIN TRAIL DAY
The army continuing its march with the same confidence and style As
they crest a hill we MOVE to the front where we see Cortes and the
other Hidalgos looking down on the city of Tenochtitlan
The city is white
The lakes are white
Everything that lies before us white Shimmering in the wind
Like snow or flowers A magical image

The Hidalgos exchange a look what is it

A conch-shell trumpet blows and the whole valley moves

White cloaks are lowered and we realize this is the Mexican army
spread out over the valley the causeways the waters

In contrast to the Aztecs the Spaniards look unspeakably literal
Like an army of solid men about to do battle with spirits

Cortes gestures and ever-so-slowly his forces begin to descend
CUT TO
EXT CORTES CAMP NIGHT

The army encamped The lake is mysterious covered with wisps of
fog

Cortes stares out Marina Cristobal and Sandoval at his side

CRISTOBAL
The assault is impossible

Cortes nods All the mens faces tell us they are now several months
into the battle

CRISTOBAL (CONTD)
We cut off their fresh water they
fight on

One of the brigantines Martin Lopes was building slips into the lake
Cortes hardly seems to notice

CRISTOBAL (CONTD)
Our ships control their lakes
disrupted their food supplies they
fight on

Cortes and Marina are peering across the waters at the magical city
of Tenochtitlan its towers glowing in the moonlight

Beat

Day after day our soldiers break
into their city and kill them by
the hundreds thousands ten

Houses on stilts blazing all across the water Alvarado run out of a
burning house carrying booty

His brig sails to the next building Passing the floating gardens
once blooming and beautiful now dry as dust

Roof of a nearby house two Aztec women and a very old man look on
fear and confusion on their faces

DIAZ (VO)

To the Aztecs war was a ritual
activity a religious rite whose
object was to obtain captives for
sacrifice They did not understand
why we burned their houses To them
it was stupid and mean it showed
we were heathens devils of
destruction whose purposes were
beyond understanding

Alvarado and his men jump off the brig and climb the steps of the
adjacent dwelling Guns drawn they enter

INT AZTEC HOUSE DAY

Two gaunt women and three children curl in a corner terrified Their
bodies are emaciated

While his men search for valuables Alvarado tries to shoo the
occupants out the door

ALVARADO
Move you idiots Go Now Get out

He stares at them in disgust

ALVARADO (CONTD)
Light it up theyll go

His men torch the far corner
OUTSIDE HOUSE
Alvarado and his men run down the steps watching the fire build
A ramshackle canoe waits at the bottom of the steps
The corner of the house which was torched is now blazing
Those inside will have to leave soon
They do not
Within moments the entire house is ablaze
There was never any movement to escape

this city for the world to marvel

Cortes eyes gleaming exhorts his men across a break in the
causeway We sense for the first time incipient triumph

DIAZ (VO)
The next day our army fighting on
three separate causeways pressed
to the heart of the city

Crossing the channel the Spaniards rage on Cortes in the lead

DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)

Once across the channels we did
not fill them in We smelled
victory and gave no thought to
retreat

EXT TENOCHTITLAN STREETS DAY

On Cortes face as he rides In his excitement we sense his ego
his drive something intensely charismatic and very ugly

Around Cortes we feel his army other horsemen at his side footmen
running behind Aztecs screaming retreating

We stay on his face The triumph of the will The masculine almost
sexual thrill of conquering

And then he turns a corner and his features change
Suddenly blank

Staring at

Impaled on stakes heads of previously captured Spaniards -

The giant Tzilacatzin laughing -

Mocking whistles from all directions -

Cortes and the other soldiers disoriented -

E sharp On a rooftop Cuauhtemoc blows his bugle -
Aztecs manifest everywhere Instantaneous assault -
Spaniards overwhelmed pulled from their horses -
Total chaos -

The Indians surging forward like a huge wave breaking over the
Spaniards -

For an instant all we can see are the cloaks of the Aztecs Is it
over So quickly

Cortes surfaces Then two more Spaniards Twenty yards away we also
spot Alvarado -

But fighting is almost impossible The enemy is too thick One
Spaniard after another is dragged away -

Cortes bleeding fighting three Indians on his back shouting
Malinche Malinche

Alvarado makes his way to Cortes side The two seem alone now no
other Spaniards in sight both men wounded bleeding profusely -

ALVARADO
I ask forgiveness for all the
blunderheaded things I have done

CORTES
Nonsense

ALVARADO
It is all a man could want in this
life to have fought here with you

CORTES
No

ALVARADO
No what

CORTES

Your words are sweet but ill-timed
This is not the end

ALVARADO
(grins with admiration)
Then lets get out of here

Cortes leaps onto the back of an Indian quickly looks around and
ducks as another Indian flies over his head trying to grab him
Comes down again and points

CORTES
The horses

Now that the two men have a purpose they fight with redoubled

energies Indians are draped over their backs hacking away at them
drawing bloodbut the men continue toward the horses which are too

penned in to move out of the way

FROM A DISTANCE we see them gain their horses and ride away

gradually making their way back to the break in the causeway where a
few Spaniards are still fighting But the causeway was not filled in

and the Spaniards are trapped The water is filled with canoes
Spaniards are being seized pulled into boats carried away -

had promised

Dismounts and enters

Cortes weak and disheartened Leg bandaged both arms his chest
For the first time we see age on his face Its as if this last

escape has sapped him of his strength and spirit

SANDOVAL
They said you were dead

Cortes nods as if it were true

CORTES
My sins are the cause of this I
pressed too hard too fast we did
not fill the channel -

SANDOVAL
Still We have survived this day
too

CORTES
Why

Sandoval looks at him in consternation and shock

CORTES (CONTD)
Why have we survived

MARINA
His spirits are low

CORTES
Im being honest
(bitter)
I told them to fill the channel
but they forgot

For the first time he is blaming someone else

SANDOVAL
Thenwas it your fault or theirs
CORTES
(pauses)

Mine All mine
And nowhave you heard about our
Indian allies
(off Sandovals look)
They desert us in the morning

SANDOVAL
Why

CORTES

Ask them
A terrible banging of drums The great huehetl atop the pyramid
Cortes and Sandoval exchange a glance
Louder drums Regular beating
In apprehension they leave the tent
EXT TENT NIGHT
They come out look into the distance
A few miles away so close you can almost touch it with your hand
A parade marching up the side of the main cue

Brightly lit by torches In the center 30 naked SPANIARDS

CORTES
Am I next Or you

Not said with fear or fatalism almost with relief

SANDOVAL
You cannot say such things
If you despair we will all -

CORTES
We have what 700 wounded men
Moctezuma was right there is a
destiny and we will meet ours
whether I despair or not

He stares at the temple

The train has reached the top something strange is happening
Feathers are put on the heads of the Spanish captives

They are naked forced to dance grotesquely with fans Its like
some bizarre homosexual gameonly this one ends in death

SANDOVAL
I cant watch

CORTES
(with disdain)
Then avert your eyes

The first Spaniard is tied to the sacrificial stone His mouth
contorted in screams we hear nothing

In camp Other soldiers watch trying to swallow their fear
On the pyramid the first Spaniards heart is held aloft
Canoes glide past the camp and Aztecs shout tauntingly

Marina reacts glances anxiously at Cortes then at the ground
Finally quietly

MARINA
This is what scares our Indian
allies
(hesitates she is worried)
They say Their Gods proclaim we
will all die within eight days

Cortes stares at her
Blinks

Looks at the canoes
Back at Marina

At Sandoval

A touch of fire returning to his eyes Mixed with irony it is not
until he gives up that he wins When he speaks it is to himself

CORTES
The war is over

SANDOVAL
Never say it If I have learned one
thing from you -

CORTES
(quietly)
For eight days we must keep to our
camps Simply maintain the
blockade

Sandoval is pleased to glimpse the return however muted of Cortes
the leader

SANDOVAL
And then

CORTES
Well still be here
Their prophecy their law will be
proved false
Their bodies will be weak from
hunger thirst
They will peer into the abyss and
contemplate their own defeat

No attacks

No Wars are won in the mind not
in the field

INT AVIARY DAY
No people Birds moving around chirping
We notice the thick lattice of sticks which keep them in
Slowly with a kind of horror we realize what were about to see

Glow of a flame nearby off-screen

Gradually it MOVES INTO FRAME Torch

Birds begin to flutter nervously twittering in discordant song
The torch moves down out of frame again Lights the lattice

A YOUNG SOLDIER doing it Stands back to watch No guilt

Birds start to scream -

Flames catching fast spreading

Birds whirling frantically beaks distorted -

Some fly directly into the flame and incinerate

Others crash into each other and plunge into the fire -

The hummingflapping sound of many wings

As the blaze spreads a piece of the latticework crashes down
Making a hole in the ceiling through which a few birds fly free
At the top the GOLDEN EAGLE caws loudly

Flames spiral upward toward it -

The Golden Eagle squeezes through a hole in the latticework Was the
hole always there Could the bird have left at any time

It soars into the sky squawking its protest

Below it the other birds have become flying incinerators setting
their fellows ablaze

We watch helplessly The destruction of civilization The senseless
incineration of something unspeakably beautiful

CUT TO
EXT LAKE SHORE NIGHT

Cortes much recovered watches as his soldiers slaughter Aztecs of
all sexes in the bg The enemy still has the will but not the
strength to fight back Far in the distance the whole city burns

CORTES

(in genuine anguish)
Why do they fight on We begged
them to surrender were refused
and we killed ten thousand ina
day We begged again refused
again and our allies killed forty
thousand How many warriors can
they have left

CRISTOBAL
A few hundred

CORTES
So why dont they surrender

Cristobal shrugs
Beat

MARINA
I know why
(beat)
I heard them say
(beat)
They thinkthat you are cowards

Silence Bewilderment as Cortes tries without success to process
this thought Marina continues

MARINA (CONTD)
To them war is hand-to-hand
combat designed to reveal the will
of the Gods
They think it is cowardly to kill
from a distance with guns and
crossbows cowardly to retreat if
you are losing a battle cowardly
and immoral to win a war by
starving the enemy

CORTES
And this is why -

MARINA
Would you concede to cowards to
heathens who gain victory by
vicious and unfair means

Cortes looks again at the slaughter of Aztecs only a hundred yards
away He sees it now if only for an instant in a different way

You were merely his instrument

piroques

As the brigantine draws close Sandoval fires a shot in the air
Two beats Then Cuauhtemoc in the center canoe stands

Long stunned silence Just this one man standing and the knowledge
in all who witness of what it means

And the drums which have been beating for 93 days for 20 minutes of
film suddenly stop It is suddenly frighteningly quiet

The Royal Emissary is at Cortes side His Wet Nurse hovers a few
feet behind

Cortes rises and touches the ground then his chest then his head
My heart and my mind welcome you

Cuauhtemoc looking very much like Moctezuma bows in reply

CUAUHTEMOC
Ihave done all I could to defend
my city
As the victor you have sacrificed
my people to your God

sword and lowers his head)

I beg you rid me of my life

Behind Cuauhtemoc we see CUAUHTEMOCS WIFE a girl of 16
Cuauhtemoc nods
Cortes rises and kisses her hand

CORTES (CONTD)
The youngest daughter of the great
Moctezuma I loved your father and
know your sister well
But you are even more beautiful

Marina translates
Cuauhtemocs wife blushes
CORTES (CONTD)
I will take good care of you as I
promised your father
Little ambiguity as to what this means
Cortes turns back to Cuauhtemoc
CORTES (CONTD)
Great Speaker there is one thing I
must ask Where is the gold The
riches We have searched your
city
As Marina translates Cuauhtemoc shakes his head
CUAUHTEMOC

I do not know Some say it was
thrown into the lake

His eyes are clear Telling the truth

Cortes nods seems to accept this but a grunt comes from behind him
The Royal Emissary gesturing Cortes jaw tightens and he nods
Apparently theyve had some previous discussion Cortes motions for
Sandoval to go to the Emissary

ROYAL EMISSARY
Tell the Soldiers to burn
Cuauhtemocs feet Burn them till
he remembers
Sandoval his face flickering with anger returns to Cortes

SANDOVAL
Is this your order too

Cortes glances with barely concealed contempt at the Emissary

SANDOVAL (CONTD)
Then prevent it

CORTES
This is no longer war We must bow
our heads to the king or he will
cut them off

SANDOVAL
But what of courage

CORTES
Useless

SANDOVAL
Honor

CORTES
We can conquer the world but we
cannot save this man from torture

Sandoval stares at Cortes

SANDOVAL
I will not order it

Cortes jaw tightens He turns whispers to a nearby SOLDIER The
Soldier goes off to prepare the torture

Sandoval is still staring contemptuously at Cortes

CUAUHTEMOC
Malinche if I am still Chief of
the Aztecs I must ask one thing
that my people be allowed to leave
this city in safety for here only
starvation and pestilence remain

CORTES
(nods tells his men )
Peaceful evacuation may begin
immediately
(to Cuauhtemoc)
Go Go now and rest

Cuauhtemoc nods and bows
The Soldier who is to arrange the foot-burning leads Cuauhtemoc away
Cuauhtemocs wife starts to follow -
CORTES (CONTD)
Sadly the rules of war dictate
that men who are prisoners must
be kept apart from their families

Cuauhtemocs wife is led in a different direction

Marina watching this

Cortes looks at her at Sandoval To Sandoval

CORTES (CONTD)
What is it

SANDOVAL
Nothing

CORTES
(to Marina re Cuauhtemocs
wife)
Is she my first mistress
(to Sandoval)
Is this the first time we burn
someone

Beat

MARINA
Sire Do you need me now
For translation

He stares at her Was there some disrespect in her attitude or was he
imagining it

CORTES

No
But stay You of all people deserve
some reward for this amazing
conquest

(beat)
Would you like to be an honest
woman

MARINA
I have always been so sire
Certainly with you

CORTES
Yes but you deserve to be married

MARINA
I know I am already

Her look says To you

He looks at her for a long moment We feel his impulse to embrace
her to follow through on his love his passion

And her eyes say she is ready Though of course as an Indian she
will accept anything

Finally he looks away from her -

CORTES
Sandoval Dont you think Marina
deserves a proper Christian
ceremony

SANDOVAL
(pleased touched)
Yes Captain

CORTES
But who should be the groom

The cold question moves like ice through Sandovals heart

SANDOVAL
The one who loves her

CORTES
Must that one marry her

SANDOVAL
It would be an act worthy of
Cortes To say across this land
that Spaniard and Indian are now
joined

Again for an instant Cortes himself is caught by this impulse But
once again it turns

CORTES
How sweet How simple

Cortes glances at the Royal Emissary
Sandoval blinks realizing

SANDOVAL
What You You mean if you wed a
savage it might impede your
chances for nobility

CORTES

It would
But surely Im not the only
candidate There must be others who
desire this lovely squaw

(looks around the room then

back at Sandoval)
Perhaps even you would

(before Sandoval can answer)
No Of course not Im sorry

We know Sandoval would marry her does love her but Cortes does not

really want to risk losing her affections by proposing such a match
He quickly

Moves away from Sandoval goes down the line of Spanish
soldiersand stops in front of DON JARAMILLO a man remarkable only
for his total absence of remarkable qualities

CORTES (CONTD)
Pardon me Captain you are Don
(barely remembering name)
Jaramillo are you not

JARAMILLO
Yes sire

CORTES
Would you take this lovely woman
for your bride

Jaramillos paralyzed Is this a trick Is Cortes seeking a pretext
for a beheading

JARAMILLO
Well I wouldnt presume to -

CORTES
I am asking you to marry her Do
you accept

JARAMILLO
Yes sir Of course sir Id be
honored to sleep w - to marry -
your
(mistress)
---I mean to say -

CORTES
And you Marina would you take
this man for a husband

She stares at Cortes Wounded Sorry for him And yet knowing
understanding everything

MARINA
It would be a great great honor
to be a Spanish noblewoman

CORTES
Father Olmeda Please take this
couple to some distant room and
perform the holy sacrament

Olmeda bows offended but obedient and starts away

Jaramillo follows

Marina does not move

They look at each other An exquisitely painful moment Cortes is
doing what - by the ethics of his time - was the very best and
noblest thing he could do But it is still offensive to his own

heart and to Marinas and to ours

CORTES (CONTD)
Do not forgetin your marital

bliss that you are still on
call day and night to perform
translation

MARINA

I am as always at your service

She bows deeplyand backs away eyes on him Finally she turns to
follow her husband

Cortes turns his back on herand on the entire company Goes to a
window Tears in his eyes

Sandoval follows

SANDOVAL
Sir

Cortes will not look at him
But somehow when he finally does his eyes are dry

CORTES
Yes my son

SANDOVAL
W-w-what is happening

Sandovals nervousness has brought back his stutter

CORTES
To me
Havent you heard
Im a God I can do anything

Sandoval stares at him in consternation rage despair

SANDOVAL
I always said I would f-follow you
even to my deathand Ive fought
with you many times at its brink
But I can no longerf-f
(fights the stutter)
follow you at all

Cortes nods
Long beat
CORTES
And I no longer need you
That is the hard truth
(long beat)

Now I stand alone
Sandoval withdraws
Cortes stares out the window
As he does we realize that a horn is blowing outside and we see
that Cortes order requested by Cuauhtemoc is already being carried
out The Aztecs are leaving the city

Old men women children Skeletal hollow eyes shriveled limbs
Look like survivors of Hiroshima

Cortes watches them go

DIAZ (VO)

It was two years before Cortes was
proclaimed Governor of New Spain
The job quickly bored him

Cortes turns from the window and lowers his eyes
DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
He set off again and again to
conquer new lands to repeat his
glory but he never did anything
comparable
(beat)
Neither did anyone else
Cortes turns back to face the room
Marina is gone
Sandoval is gone
Everyone else is waiting on him
He sees that they would wait forever Literally
DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
People ask was he a great man
Undoubtedly
A good man
No A good man never would have
achieved these things
With an air of command that is unassailable Cortes shouts
CORTES
Raise the purple pendant of
Castile
CUT TO
EXT PALACE DAY

The purple Castilian flag flaps in the breeze above the city Below
it

The Aztec exodus

Broken bodies vessels for broken spirits

Tzilacatzin still alive but somehow no longer a Giant His eyes are
deep and black shoulders stooped the skin hangs off his body as if

he were an old man

But the faces of the children are what is impossible to watch so
young yet void without soul
149

Following our impulse to avert our eyes we look away up into the
sky

Far overhead a Golden Eagle is flying
Flying away
Not in the same direction the people are going
No Somewhere else
Into hiding
or seclusion
or extinction
CUT TO
EXT ORANGE GROVES DAY
Children (white Indian mestizo and mulatto) are playing happily in
a grove of orange trees laden with fruit Nearby BERNAL DIAZ as an
old man sits at a wooden table writing with a quill
DIAZ (VO)
Three years later Cortes ordered
Cuauhtemoc hung on dubious charges
of treason
He pauses looks out at the orange trees resumes
DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Aztec civilization was destroyed
Their spirit broken their Gods
discredited the people died out
If you travel here to Mexico only
a few statues and pieces of jewelry
remain
The orange trees are shimmering in the wind
DIAZ (VO) (CONTD)
Today the third of April 1576 I
look back and my heart is filled
with pride at what we accomplished
(beat)
But my eyes are filled with tears

FADE OUT

PRODUCTION NOTE

The battles on pages 16-7 42-3 and 45-6 are designed to be all shot
at the same location using the same extras Ideally the location
would be carefully chosen so that three different wide-shots facing
three different directions can suggest different places

The author gratefully acknowledges his debt to The Conquest of New
Spain by Bernal Diaz first published in 1577 and the monumental

History of the Conquest of Mexico by William E Prescott first
published in 1843
