EXT ANGELA ROSE DECK - FISHING WATERS - DAWN

Open ocean Cape Ann off the coast of Gloucester
Massachusetts A rusty thirty-foot FISHING TRAWLER the
Angela Rose slices the grey water Waves slap the boat the
engine roars the winch creaks and gulls circle overhead as
the nets come up hoping for a fish “Something’s Got a Hold
on Me” by Etta James plays from a small radio

On deck RUBY (17 in fishing Grundens) belts out the song
as she runs the winch raising the net above the sorting bin
She sings along with the radio as she works Her father
FRANK (50s bearded weathered) and brother LEO (early 20s
handsome tattooed) guide the catch into position They
signal to Ruby She pulls the release and the net opens
dropping an impressive haul of fish onto the deck

Ruby Leo and Frank sort the fish into tubs measuring them
and tossing the bycatch back overboard Leo and Frank pay no
attention to Ruby’s singing They sort and clean fish with

the efficiency of guys who have done this their whole lives

Reaching into the pile of fish Ruby pulls out an old shoe
She laughs tosses it to Leo He gestures that it’s too
small Throws it overboard

Frank shovels ice over the layers of fish Leo cleans the
fish by slushing them around in a bucket with his boot The
radio crackles

EXT SALGADO FISH WHARF - DAY

The Angela Rose pulls into the dock Ruby Frank and Leo off-
load their catch The processor TONY SALGADO (heavy
Italian) weighs their haul The Salgados run everything

Fishermen mingle loading and unloading boats As Ruby weaves
through them ARTHUR the ice distributor calls to her

Raucous loud fisherman’s bar Leo sits at a table with
Brady Chubs Jimmy and the other guys Gertie is working her
shift as a bus-girl

BRADY
So then he hooks his arm around
the pole bear hugging it But when
he does he loses his pants They
go down to his knees There he is
hanging with his milky white
ginger ass hanging out And he’s
still like thirty feet from the
pole But of course he’s shit-

faced--
JIMMY
Shocker
Leo watches the conversation -- we see it through his eyes

He focuses on Brady’s lips but the banter is too fast for
him He’s only catching some of it After awhile he’s
exhausted and tunes out

MIKE a meathead makes his way past the table to join Gio
and Tony at the bar He accidentally bumps the table
spilling his beer on Leo He doesn’t apologize Leo turns
gestures “What the fuck” Mike does fake sign language
mocking him

Suddenly Leo is out of his chair He yanks Mike off his bar
stool throwing him to the floor The bar erupts in chaos
Mike is up like a rocket and lands a punch back as --

The two guys brawl Shouts as the fishermen jump in trying
to separate them Tony and Gio lead their guy away Leo
pissed shakes off the other guys as they try to corral him

BRADY
Hey buddy come have a seat

Leo brushes them off angrily and heads to the bar

him He rubs a shiner on the left side of his face

BARTENDER (CONTD)
(understanding)
Ah yeah

The bartender pours him another Leo notices Gertie hanging
behind the bar carefully watching him

Gertie gestures “You okay” He shrugs “Whatever”

Leo gestures “What are you doing in here” She points to her
bar-rag and apron indicating that she’s working

They stare at each other for a moment Gertie boldly takes
his phone and types in her number Then pulls her own phone
out of her pocket waiting He considers it Then TEXTS HER
Leo You work here You’re not even old enough to drink

She texts back

moment before she speaks

JACKIE
When you were born at the
hospital they gave you a hearing
test And there you were so tiny
and sweet with these electrodes
all over you And I prayed that
you would be deaf When they told
us that you were hearing I felt
my heart sank

RUBY
Why

JACKIE
I was worried that we wouldn’t
connect Like me and my mom we’re
not close I thought I would fail
you That being deaf would make me
a bad mom

RUBY
Don’t worry You are a bad mom for
so many other reasons

Jackie smiles

JACKIE
I know I drive you crazy with the
clothes the makeup But honestly
I’m happy that you know who you
are You’re brave Not like me

FEMALE JURY MEMBER

BERNARDO
Thank you

The jury members exchange confused glances

The pianist steps away from the piano and Bernardo takes her
place He gives Ruby a look - “You can do this”

He begins to play “Both Sides Now” Ruby begins to sing Her
voice is timid cautious she’s paralyzed with fear

RUBY
(singing)
Rows and floes of angel hair and
ice cream castles in the air and
feather canyons everywhere--

Bernardo deliberately plays the wrong note Ruby falters

BERNARDO
So sorry my mistake Let’s take it
from the top

He gives Ruby a hard look - “now or never” Ruby nods
understanding Bernardo starts to play again

Ruby looks up at the balcony and notices Frank Jackie and
Leo sneaking into the auditorium They take their seats
quietly She glances at the jury to see if they noticed They
didn’t She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath

RUBY
(singing)
Rows and floes of angel hair and
ice cream castles in the air and
feather canyons everywhere
Ive looked at clouds that way

She glances up at her family They smile down at her

RUBY (CONTD)
(singing)
But now they only block the sun
they rain and snow on everyone so
many things I would have done but
clouds got in my way

Ruby begins to SIGN fluidly interpreting the lyrics with her
hands as she sings The movement releases her voice which
comes out with increasing purity and resonance

RUBY (CONTD)
(singing)
Ive looked at clouds from both
sides now from up and down and
still somehow its clouds
illusions I recall I really dont
know clouds at all --

Ruby’s voice sails out Bernardo grins The jury surprised
turns to see who she is signing to

RUBY (CONTD)
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels
the dizzy dancing way you feel as
every fairy tale comes real Ive
looked at love that way

She sings directly to her parents This is for them They
watch her moved and proud

RUBY (CONTD)

(singing)
But now it’s just another show you
leave ‘em laughing when you go And
if you care don’t let ‘em know
Don’t give yourself away I’ve
looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still
somehow it’s love’s illusions I
recall I really don’t know love at
all
