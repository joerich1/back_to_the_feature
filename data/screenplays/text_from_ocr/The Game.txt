he

poses for a shot with his mother MRS VAN ORTON a stiff-looking
society matron A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places
the baby in Schuylers arms Schuyler is ultra-careful over-

He crouches by the wino winces at a strong smell covers his
nose
He reaches out to touch the body but hesitates pulls back
Alive

SCHUYLER

The wino suddenly SPRINGS UP like a jack-in-the-box bending
backwards impossibly at the hips Schuyler lets out a CRY and
scrambles back toward his car
THE HEAD swivels to face him-- its a grotesque HARLEQUIN its
head
made of COLORED GLASS LIT from within The MOUTH DROPS OPEN and
a
tongue in the shape of a corkscrew SPRINGS OUT
A SMALL KEY ON A HOOK dangles from the tip of the tongue One of
the harlequins glass eyes WINKS

Schuyler squints at the papers in his hand flipping through
them

BAER (0S)
Thats not how you play the game

SCHUYLER turns on him a suspicion forming

BAER
You couldve fucking told me

SCHUYLER
What game

Schuyler studies the SENSELESS PAGES for a moment then puts them
down shaking off his apprehensions

SCHUYLER
Never mind well just have to
go with the earlier draft

In BG one exec picks up a page WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT who
moves out of the room Schuyler moves to his briefcase Its
LOCKED He starts patting his pockets

BAER

Baer has a malevolent expression Schuyler looks at him

SCHUYLER
Where are they

BAER

A couple of execs stifle chuckles Schuylers suspicions mount

SCHUYLER

His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in
front of him He picks it up

INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note
CRS CALLED We dont see whats written below

SCHUYLER is reeling paranoia confirmed

SCHUYLER

Baer stares at him blankly Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes
seems disoriented trying to piece it all together

SCHUYLER
So the game its just a screen to
blow this deal

BAER
Im not following you

SCHUYLER
Like hell you arent How did you
get my brother involved thats
unforgivable

The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion

he speaks the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK Schuyler
stares at him menacingly Hesitantly

ASSISTANT
Um sorry to interrupt Weve

fax so they re-sent the material
Its all OK now

The assistant comes over cheerfully places the crucial documents
in front of Schuyler The assistant fishes in his pocket

ASSISTANT
Oh and Mr Van Orton-- are these

floor of the chopper

Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out
looks from them to the paperwork Then he glances back at the
handwritten note on the table
INSERT NOTE It actually reads CBS CALLED (Schuylers thumb

or
a Post-It note covered the base of the B before making it look
like an R) It continues Re Interview with Alan B on Sun

As she says this she walks right into the ELECTRIC DOORS which
fail to open for them

THEIR POV-- THROUGH THE DOORS the gathered STAFF and PATIENTS all
turn at once to regard Christine and Schuyler They GRIN and
WINK

ON SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE who barely get the chance to register
this before--

THE LIGHTS GO OUT PITCH BLACKNESS and SUDDEN SILENCE We hear
only SCHUYLERS BITTER LAUGHTER Dialogue OVER DARKNESS

SCHUYLER

We hear RUSTLING in a purse but still see next to nothing

SCHUYLER
Its a little hard to explain

We hear the STRIKING OF A MATCH theres some ORANGE LIGHT--

CHRISTINE holds the match The whole area is DESERTED except
for

the two of them SCHUYLER kicks at the glass doors-- theyre not

going to give nothing is visible beyond them

on his head Hes facing a BRICK WALL through the door

CHRISTINE cant help but LAUGH then YELPS in pain as the match
burns her fingers LIGHTS another Schuyler flips open his
phone

SCHUYLER
Damn it no signal

CHRISTINE
Heres a lightswitch--

SCHUYLER

She flips it on A BLINDING STROBE FLASHES for a few seconds--
both
CRY OUT-- then the BULB EXPLODES in a shower of sparks

SCHUYLER
I dont know the rules if there are
any but it seems the obvious move
usually backfires

CHRISTINE
Of course I have no idea what
youre talking about

Theyve taken a few steps forward exploring the DARK She
LIGHTS

a cigarette with the next match nearly running into ANOTHER
DOOR

She RATTLES it-- locked

CHRISTINE
Son of a bitch

Schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold CRS key-- nope

SCHUYLER

Wrong key
CHRISTINE

In the matchlight we see Schuyler fumbling in his pockets

pulling

in

and

each

out the ROSY SUNGLASSES from the Rasta He puts them on

CHRISTINE
Too bright for you is it

SCHUYLERS POV as the last MATCH GOES OUT-- CHRISTINE GLOWS RED
the matchlight for a moment then as soon as it goes out we see
GLOW of FLUORESCENT PAINT on the ground a series of STRIPES
ARROWS in DIFFERENT COLORS GLOWING These start PARALLEL near
where he stands then RADIATE in different directions CHRISTINE

is but a SILHOUETTE against the COLORED LINES

SCHUYLER
I can see now Grab my arm

CHRISTINE
No way Youre crazy

CHRISTINE moves away from him

SCHUYLER
Stay on the path

A BURST OF FLAME erupts from the GROUND close enough to scare the
shit out of CHRISTINE who SCREAMS SCHUYLER hurries toward her

The FLAMES VANISH she lurches in a differrent direction--

SCHUYLER
Christine dont move

CHRISTINE
Leave me alone

She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface falls sliding down
gentle SLOPE

CHRISTINE
Help

SCHUYLER follows FALLING himself They try to reach toward
other for purchase but its no good the slope is getting
steeper

58A In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four-

SCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out She starts to pull
him
upward but--

SCHUYLER
Where are the glasses

CHRISTINE
Fuck the glasses

SCHUYLER
We cant get out of here without them

He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs about to get
sick

finally coming up with the glasses He shakes them free of
INSECTS

and clambers out to join Christine whos GASPING and brushing

the
bugs off of her SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a
BUG

SCHUYLER

She grabs his arm both are now covered in MUCK from the bug
soup

SCHUYLER

CHRISTINE
Blue

He takes off the glasses puts them on her She looks around
HER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR

CHRISTINE
Wow OK this is kinda cool Hey

SCHUYLER slips the glasses off her puts them back on

SCHUYLER
Sorry its my game But well

HIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them
going

in circles now and then INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other

colors up a series of ramps This space sometimes resembles a

PARKING GARAGE scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL

CHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path

CHRISTINE

blind whats your name anyway
SCHUYLER

Sky Van Orton

CHRISTINE
Sky Were your folks hippies or
something

SCHUYLER

Far from it

CHRISTINE

SCHUYLER

58B LATER CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now as they move in a
seemingly random pattern in the darkness

SCHUYLER
Its a company called Consumer
Recreation Services CRS I never
know whats gonna happen next

CHRISTINE
Well who does

SCHUYLER
Until recently I had a pretty
good idea Duck

The BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL soon theyre
crawling on hands and knees

CHRISTINE
So are you like a serious masochist
or just really really bored

SCHUYLER
Im sorry you shouldnt have been
dragged into this

CHRISTINE
Well I have to tell you
something Some guy came into
Leos yesterday showed me your
picture offered me 250 bucks to
spill that food on you

SCHUYLER

CHRISTINE
Said it was a practical joke I
figured what the hell I can use
the money-- I got him up to 500
I hated that fucking job anyway--

SCHUYLER
Wait so the heart attack you
knew that was a joke too--

CHRISTINE
No It scared the shit out of me--

SCHUYLER
But that CPR routine--

CHRISTINE
I used to be a lifeguard

SCHUYLER
(points)
Were getting somewhere
The TUNNEL has opened up again Theres even a tiny bit of

VISIBLE

like

halo

LIGHT now He takes off the glasses gives them to her

HER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different
directions A few steps onward they all converge at a point

the spokes of a wheel at a WHITE SPOT on the ground
SCHUYLER AND CHRISTINE look around then Schuyler points upward--
A WHITE RING overhead it looks like the underside of a MANHOLE

COVER with an illuminated CIRCLE OF LIGHT around the rim a

CHRISTINE
How do we get up there

SCHUYLER steps on the circle of WHITE-- its a BUTTON A ROPE
LADDER drops down

59 EXT WALKWAY - EVENING

A MANHOLE COVER slides aside SCHUYLER climbs out and helps
Christine up Its a short covered WOODEN WALKWAY in an alley

CHRISTINE
Well that was pointless but
different kind of fun

SCHUYLER
Mm a different kind of fun
Whats your middle name

CHRISTINE
Louise why

SCHUYLER points to some GRAFFITI-- a HEART with SVO CLK

SCHUYLER
Youre supposed to be here they
picked you for a reason

CHRISTINE
But-- why

They start to move shakily down the CONSTRUCTION WALKWAY both
bedraggled covered in goo HANDBILLS cover one wall

SCHUYLER
Probably knew youd play Good
Samaritan for that guy drag me
along-- but they could have hired an
actor for that less of a risk

ON THE WALL a series of HANDBILLS say ARENT YOU FORGETTING
SOMETHING SCHUYLER puzzles over these as they move gets to

one
last one-- BEHIND YOU STUPID
SCHUYLER looks back toward the end of the alley--
A YELLOW DUMPSTER with the logo CONSOLIDATED REFUSE SUPPLY and
the smaller image of a KEY SCHUYLER moves quickly to it throws
open the lid
ANGLE IN DUMPSTER-- a MOUNTAIN of SHREDDED PAPER
SCHUYLER rolls his eyes sorting through it Christine
approaches

CHRISTINE
This is really sick I think
theyre trying to fix us up

SCHUYLER
Maybe you cant play alone--

CHRISTINE
Who says I want to play

(a sigh)
OK what the fuck are you doing in
the dumpster

SCHUYLER
Theres something in here I need

He climbs inside dives in and pops up again in a moment with-
CLOSE-- A Z-SHAPED WINDOW CRANK Sure enough theres a KEY
embossed on the side

SCHUYLER climbs out again brandishing the small crank

CHRISTINE
Whats that for

SCHUYLER
I imagine Ill find out

60 EXT CRS BUILDING - EVENING
SCHUYLER pockets the crank as he and CHRISTINE emerge from the
alley PEDESTRIANS give them a wide berth To a PASSERBY

CHRISTINE

Schuyler heads straight for the CRS doors the large numbers 636
printed above-- its LOCKED He tries his little GOLD KEY on a
deadbolt its USELESS of course

SCHUYLER

CHRISTINE

of Help yourself to the fridge

He points to a MINI-FRIDGE shuts the door a moment later we
hear

WATER RUNNING She looks around the office letting down her

facade She seems quite impressed and intimidated by the
place

She looks back toward the bathroom door-- maybe this guy isnt so

bad after all From this point she takes a more seductive tack
62 INT DRESSING AREABATH - NIGHT

a LONG HARD KISS

JACK THE DRIVER middle-aged and trustworthy turns and catches a
glimpse of this quickly turns away
CHRISTINE breaks the kiss sinks back against the red leather

seat
waiting for Schuyler to make the next move

disappear He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment then STARTS at the
sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street
ANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year model and color

of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a
gun A camera with a long lens The car makes a quick U-turn
and
drives in the same direction as the limo
SCHUYLER curious STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue Then he
glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye
He

doesnt put the car in gear picks up the envelope instead

CLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words OPEN ME are printed in BLOCK

LETTERS on the outside He opens it quickly-- theres no ticket

inside but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear

wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS BETTER SAFE THAN

SCHUYLER frowns at this and throws the note aside He flips on
the

GATE GUARD
Yo

ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the gate guard jogs TOWARD the elevators
pulling his gun

SCHUYLER starts to panic pulls his own gun and POINTS IT AT THE

GUARD who freezes and raises his hands Behind him the
Security

Man approaches Schuyler from a different angle his gun out

Schuyler cant get a bead on both of them

SECURITY MAN
Youre a dead man

Schuyler looks one more time at the elevator panel--

AT BASE OF PANEL a gold keyhole CLOSER-- the letters CRS are
printed beneath it very small

SCHUYLER shakes his head-- it couldnt be but what else can he
do

ANGLE INTO GARAGE-- the guards are fanning out and getting
closer

SCHUYLER reaches with one hand for his keys fumbling for the
small
gold key he received at the start of the game

ON PANEL-- his hand shakes as he tries to insert the gold key
it
fits into the hole he turns it and PUSHES THE BUTTON for 12

WIDER-- as the DOORS CLOSE both guards train their guns-- but
too
late Schuylers on his way up

184A THE GLASS ELEVATOR RISES through completely blackened
spaces

SCHUYLER stares at a BULLET HOLE in the back of the glass
elevator

a remnant of Feingolds murder He holds the gun in front of

himself in both hands then he closes his eyes steeling
himself

almost in an attitude of prayer

185 INT ATRIUM - NIGHT

PITCH BLACK but for the LIT ELEVATOR ascending swiftly through
the
darkness Schuyler like a solitary spaceship pilot looks

upward

toward his unknown destination
186 INT CRS ELEVATOR - NIGHT
The DIGITAL READOUT slows as it comes to 10 11 and STOPS at 12

SCHUYLER comes out of his trance slips the revolver back into

his

jacket pocket keeps a hand there and stands against a wall of
the

elevator as the DOORS OPEN ON--

187 INT 12TH FLOOR COMMISSARY - NI
GHT

--A BUSTLING NOISY COMMISSARY Schuyler keeps the gun concealed

as he steps out of the elevator-- nobody here is paying any

attention to him anyway Theres a cafeteria style counter along

SCHUYLER inches into the room meets the eyes of--

CHRISTINE whos just come away from the cafeteria counter with a

tray of food She nearly drops it looks over her shoulder to
see

if anyone is watching Suddenly Schuyler is in front of her

backs her into an alcove-- she holds the tray between them as if
to

protect herself

CHRISTINE

For a moment Schuylers not sure His voice is flat monotonal

SCHUYLER

SCHUYLER

CHRISTINE

SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING She starts to move toward a
table he blocks her path

SCHUYLER

CHRISTINE

SCHUYLER

Schuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND Christine looks

SCHUYLER
Seemed like a nice guy actually
father of three--

CHRISTINE
Well look Im sure its just

SCHUYLER
You taste it you fucking vampire

He pushes his palm in her face she flinches swipes him away
puts a finger to her ear as--

THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from
downstairs burst into the commissary

Suddenly the ROOM QUIETS many others are touching their ears

They all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine The
guard gestures at Schuyler attempting a smile

GATE GUARD
Could you come with us please
Youre not authorized to be here

Schuyler grabs Christine wraps an arm around her throat puts
his
GUN to her neck

SCHUYLER
Back off Everybody back off

He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally
toward the nearest door she CHOKES and GASPS

188 INT STAIRWELL - NIGHT
The door shuts behind them the stairs only lead UP

SCHUYLER

helicopters there are air conditioning vents ducts etc A

MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door
followed

by Schuyler She spins her back to the EDGE of the atrium a

black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT

white RAILING around it

Schuyler SLAMS the door a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE
He throws the HEAVY BOLT He and Christine circle each other
warily his gun trained on her POUNDING from the other side
MUFFLED VOICES that cant be heard

For the first time Christine focuses on the gun in his hand
then
clutches the railing

CHRISTINE

Schuyler hesitates a moment looking in the direction of the
door

SCHUYLER
I open the door and I die

ON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE but the ALARM DROWNS out the
sounds of VOICES on the other side

SCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him He
points

the gun at her again He looks ready to use it The following

DIALOG overlaps and collides growing AURAL CHAOS--

SCHUYLER

Schuyler runs a hand over his sweating forehead the gun

time

that she might be telling the truth She steps closer

CHRISTINE

CHRISTINE

He looks at her almost ready to lower the gun He raises his
bloody hand to his lips about to taste it

RADIO VOICE (filter)
--were at the North entrance
Number 2 just a few more seconds
and well nail him--

Schuylers eyes dart toward--
ANOTHER DOORWAY on the other side of the atrium like the one

thats bolted The number 2 is painted on it in RED The handle
starts to TURN just as--
--CHRISTINE LUNGES AT HIM to wrest the gun away

SCHUYLER comes to his senses struggling The GUN GOES OFF the
report should be DEAFENING

He spins points the gun at Door 2 and FIRES again several

times

her

THE ALARM STOPS-- SILENCE
Christine STIFFENS falls backwards onto the ground clutching

BLOOD-DRENCHED stomach Schuyler just stares Dark blood SPILLS
from her mouth as she CHOKES in pain

CHRISTINE
Oh God I blew it we blew it

DOOR 2 OPENS and--

DAVID steps through He wears a brightly colored silly looking
PARTY HAT carries a magnum of CHAMPAGNE bearing a huge BOW that
reads SURPRISE BLOOD PUMPS from HIS CHEST He DROPS THE
BOTTLE which SHATTERS David collapses amidst the broken

glass

A BLOW OF THE AXE SEVERS the deadbolt and Door 1 flies open

behind

Schuyler FEINGOLD is the first of a group to come charging
through he wears a TUXEDO with a ROSE in the lapel holds the

SCHUYLER spins points the gun at this axe-wielding man then
utterly stunned lowers it in disbelief

FEINGOLD looks from Schuyler to the wounded Christine-- her agony
is painful to watch He drops the axe with a CLATTER and runs to
her side kneels His voice CRACKS

FEINGOLD
You shot her No
(looking toward David)
Qh God no

THE GUARD and SECURITY MAN come out on the roof looking very
disturbed followed by the RASTA and a few OTHERS Many are
dressed for a party now Feingold looks to their horrified

faces

FEINGOLD
He fucking shot them

RASTA
Tll call an ambulance

The Rasta dashes downstairs Schuyler backs away drops the gun

staggers over to David Hes GASPING for breath CRS EMPLOYEES

give the brothers a wide berth move toward Feingold and
Christine

SCHUYLER
David David no no--

DAVID
Oh God Oh God Sky save me I

SCHUYLER
Youre not gonna die Im here

Davids already DEAD eyes wide body limp

WITH FEINGOLD and CHRISTINE He holds his colorful cummerbund
over
her stomach to staunch the bleeding She CHOKES in pain

FEINGOLD
Hang on just hang on youre
gonna make it--

CHRISTINE
That stupid

They stare over at Schuyler registering Davids death Schuyler
is now drenched in his brothers blood rocking him in his arms
Most of the assorted CRS people move to get out of the building
before the cops show MURMURING amongst themselves in fear

FEINGOLD
Oh God I thought you could
handle it All the tests they

said you could handle it
CHRISTINE yells at Schuyler unable to stand--

CHRISTINE
You fucking psycho you piece of
shit how could you--

SCHUYLER gently lowers his brother and rises like a zombie now
The big security man picks up his gun and backs away with it
keeping it out of his reach
Schuyler backs away from the body starts to SHAKE looks as if
he
really has lost his mind Feingold SOBS aloud

FEINGOLD
God why-- there was no point It was
supposed to be fun

Schuyler looks back and forth from the wounded Christine-- who
GASPS silent curses beyond speech-- to Davids body

He slowly turns to the Atrium pit directly in front of him Hes
strangely calm

SCHUYLER
Fun

SHIFT TO SLOW MOTION

SCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit

THE OTHERS react in HORROR SHOUT NO lunging TOWARD HIM
DAVIDS HEAD suddenly MOVES he BLINKS

SCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit

CHRISTINE jumps to her feet perfectly alert a hand extended
SCREAMING just as--

SCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE and--
DAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT

DAVID
SKY NOOOO

SCHUYLER sees this too late--

HE AND DAVID make terrified helpless eye contact across the
void

arms outstretched Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable

error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for
an

agonizing MOMENT

THEN HE FALLS LEAVE SLOW MOTION

PAST so rapidly we cant quite process them

192 INTERCUT WITH INCREASING DARKNESS GROUND RUSHING

CLOSER

ON SCHUYLERS FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes

before

the end BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him his
eyes roll into his head closing--

ANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real theyve COME ON to show--

SCHUYLERS IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back arms outstretched eyes
squeezed shut--—

--and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION

that

covers the floor of the atrium

SCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times gradually coming to
a

rest harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him

He doesnt move a muscle his eyes still closed

CLOSER ON HIS FACE muscles twitch His eyes open

HIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of
the

building around the atrium THE FULL MOON in the very center

through the hole in the glass

All the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH packed with
people

SCHUYLER stares upward mouth open motionless

DAVID comes running from an elevator leaps up onto the cushion
and

bounces over to Schuyler a huge smile on his face

DAVID
Hey bro how you doin

Getting no response David hops closer squats by Schuylers

side

DAVID
Admit it you werent bored

SCHUYLER remains motionless Davids worried now grabs his arm

and

starts shaking him

DAVID
Jesus Sky cmon Sky--

SCHUYLER begins to LAUGH a tremendous catharsis DAVID laughs

too greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet

THE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING

surface LAUGHING CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the
cushion

CHEERING and APPLAUDING

SCHUYLER wipes his eyes shaking his head with amazement Then
he

hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw sending him flying onto
his

back on the cushion MORE CHEERS from the crowd as if they were

watching a boxing match
