HIGGY THE SIDEKICK (CONFUSED)
Rally

HUME
Everybody loves certainty and we
all wish there was someone who
could tell us exactly what the
answer is but of course what
makes us human is that this simply
doesnt exist we have to live the
answers ourselves in some way that
nobody can do for us But one thing
is certain it sure is easy to make
money by giving people so called
answers especially if its mean-
spirited for some reason People
think the harsher it is the more
right it must be Id like to say
to our listeners wake up and to
everyone here at the station you
are going straight to the home of
Satan when you die especially you
Marge I hope in the meantime
someone will put lots of tacks on
your for you to sit on
