9 EXT HIGHWAY ON THE WAY TO DEER MEADOW - DAY
Desmonds car on the highway
10 INT DESMONDS CAR - SAME

As they barrel down the highway -
STANLEY
That was really something That
dancing girl
(after a beat)
What did it mean

DESMOND
Code If you work with Gordon you learn
that right away

STANLEY
Code Ive heard a lot about this

Desmond pulls his arm back so that only his fingers come out
of his
sleeve

DESMOND
Sort of shorthand

STANLEY
(missing the humor)
Shorthand really

DESMOND
Were heading into a difficult situation

STANLEY
How do you figure

DESMOND
Ill explain it to you Do you remember
Lils dance
As Desmond explains we -
INTERCUT WITH
11 FLASHBACK LILS DANCE
In slow motion

ON LILS SOUR FACE

DESMOND
Lil was wearing a sour face

STANLEY
What do you mean

DESMOND
Her face had a sour look that means
ON LIL BLINKING

were going to have trouble with the
local authorities They are not going to
be receptive to the FBI

BOTH EYES
DESMOND
Both eyes blinking means there is going
to be trouble higher up the eyes of the

local authority A sheriff and a deputy
That would be my guess Two of the

local law enforcers are going to be a
problem

ON LIL PUTTING ONE HAND IN HER POCKET AND ONE IN A FIST

DESMOND (continued)
If you noticed she had one hand in her
pocket which means they are hiding
something and the other hand made a
fist which means they are going to be
belligerent

ON LIL WALKING IN PLACE

DESMOND (continued)
Lil was walking in place which means
theres going to be a lot of legwork
involved

WE SEE COLE PUTTING HIS FINGERS IN FRONT OF HIS FACE AND

SAYING LIL
IS HIS SISTERS

GIRL

DESMOND (continued)
Cole said Lil was his mothers sisters
girl What is missing in that sentence
The Uncle

STANLEY
Oh the uncle is missing

DESMOND
Not Coles Uncle but probably the
sheriffs uncle in federal prison

STANLEY
So the sheriff had got an Uncle whos
committed a serious crime

ON LILS RED WIG
DESMOND
Right which is probably why Lil was
wearing a red wig meaning we are
headed into a dangerous situation Let
me ask you something Stanley did you
notice anything about the dress

STANLEY
The dress she was wearing had been
altered to fit her I noticed a different
colored thread where the dress had been
taken in It wasnt her dress or she
must have lost some weight

DESMOND
Gordon said you were good The tailored
dress is our code for drugs Did you

notice what was pinned to it

STANLEY
A blue rose

DESMOND
Very good but I cant tell you about
that

Stanley rides along quietly for a while

STANLEY
What did Gordons tie mean

DESMOND
What Thats just Gordons bad taste

STANLEY
Why couldnt he have just told you all
these things

DESMOND
He talks loud And he loves his code

STANLEY
I see He does talk loud

DESMOND
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer
Meadow without thinking it was a
high priority situation

STANLEY
It must be a high priority situation

CLIFF
(still smiling)
Oh

Desmond walks towards the door that obviously must go to

Sheriff

Cables office

Cliff blocks his way with his arm across the doorway daring
him to

do something While they stare eye to eye Desmonds hand
goes up

slowly towards Cliffs face in a slow mesmerizing way Cliff
tries

to knock Chets hand away Chet counters by grabbing Cliffs
nose

and pinches a nerve to its side injecting Cliff with a great
amount

of pain

CLIFF (continued)

Desmond spins the deputy 180 degrees placing himself on the
inside of

the office and then still pressing the nerve guides Cliff down
into a

chair

While the Deputys eyes tear copiously Desmond turns to the
secretary

the photo to get an idea of the design on
the ring but we should do a blowup of
this anyway

STANLEY
(squinting at the picture)
May I see the magnifying glass Agent
Desmond
(takes a look then looks at

in the photo to ascertain the design on

(confidentially)
One thing that has been troubling me
That lamp at the diner Do you think

Faulty wiring

36 INT SAM STANLEYS APARTMENT SPOKANE - DAY
All around the walls of Stanleys apartment are work benches
with
adding machinery sitting on top of them In the middle of the
room
is a portable plastic pool with milky white water and
crystallized
salt formations clinging to the sides like quartz rocks From
one

odd looking piece of machinery there are wires which extend
into the
pool

Coopers eyes go to the pool and back to Stanley as Sam talks
about
Desmond
STANLEY
Agent Chet said he wanted to check the
trailer court one more time He had me
drive the van with the body back here

Whiteman
machine

on
Teresa

COOPER
And no one found the ring

No sir we did not

Cooper straightens up from the microscope Stanley extends
his hand

STANLEY

close to the tracks is a car

this case has got a strange feeling for
me Not only has Agent Chester
Desmond disappeared but this is one of
Coles Blue Rose cases The clues that
were found by Agent Desmond and Agent
Stanley have lead to dead ends The

feeling that the killer will strike again
But like the song says who knows

think

JOSIE

I dont want to offend the customs of
your country

TRUMAN
Believe me Josie you would not offend
the customs of this country For
instance I dont eat fish eyes

JOSIE
Fish eyes
TRUMAN
Even if it offended someone I wouldnt
eat a fish eye

JOSIE
Why wouldnt you eat a fish eye Harry

TRUMAN
I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in
Seattle He was digging through his
food with his chopsticks for about five
minutes till he found the fish eye and he
dropped it into his throat I guess it
must have gotten stuck in his uvula
because right away he started to have
trouble His throat began to flutter
there like there was a wind blowing
And he couldnt swallow and they rushed
to him and loosened his collar and they
were asking him if he was alright and
he started to turn blue and his eyes
started to roll back into his head and he
still couldnt get the fish eye out and
they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver I
went over to him as they were
preparing to do an emergency
tracheotomy They were over him with
a knife when he suddenly shot the fish
eye out of his throat and right onto the
ceiling Splat It just stuck up there
and spread out It was about the size of
a half dollar And thats why I dont ever
eat fish eyes

He plays the guitar for Josie Then stops

TRUMAN (continued)
Im not saying its right or wrong its
just the way I feel Its the custom
thing I was thinking of In America we
dont use any part of the fish but the
meat just to the side of the insides We
throw away the tail the rest of the
insides and the head

JOSIE
I understand

TRUMAN
We throw away the whole head
