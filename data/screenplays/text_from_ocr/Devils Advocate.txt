efficient man with a good case

BARBARA

enduring this testimony

( )

PROSECUTOR
In your own words Barbara can
you tell us exactly what happened
during the next few minutes

KEVIN LOMAX Defense counsel Taking it all in

BARBARA (0S)
I told him I was afraid I would
miss my bus He promised I would
get to the bus on time if I would
help him to do something

Kevin -- his eyes -- drifting around the courtroom --
taking inventory -- assessing damage --

BARBARA (0S)
- Then he put -- before I could
say anything -- he placed his hand
inside my blouse

Kevin -- checking the jury and --

BARBARA (0S)
-- I was so frightened I didnt
move I thought if I was just
quiet it would be okay

Kevin -- checking Gettys -- seeing something that stops
him cold --

BARBARA (0S)
Then his other hand went up
under -- inside my skirt

Gettys hand -- down below the table -- down where no one
but Kevin could possibly see it -- Gettys fingers subtly
feeling their way along the leg of his chair --

BARBARA (0S)

his hand then it started he
started moving back and forth --
farther and farther inside my
skirt

Kevin -- glancing around -- nobody else can see it --

BARBARA (0S)
--- he said he was testing to see
if I had any special feelings
that he wanted to find out what
kind of feelings I had

( )

Gettys hand -- excited now -- stroking the chair leg --
absently -- involuntarily -- unmistakably sexual --

BARBARA (0S)

-- I didnt know what to say I
was trying to think of something
to say but I was confused and he
just kept on -- with his hand --
moving it -- under my dress --
higher and higher

Kevin is rocked Trying not to show it

BARBARA (0S)
-- then I I was asking him to
stop but it was like he couldnt
hear me -- he just kept on --

Suddenly Gettys hand stops moving --

BARBARA (0S)
-- and then I screamed

Kevin looks up to find Gettys eyes waiting for him
Gettys quickly returns his hand into his lap Hes been
caught -- watching as Kevin turns away and --

BARBARA
then he he got mad and said
we would have to try again

sometime

PROSECUTOR
And did he try again

BARBARA
Not with me

PROSECUTOR
With friends of yours

BARBARA
Yes

PROSECUTOR

And when you told them what he had
done to you they told you what he
had done to them isnt that true

BARBARA

Cullen has done a lot of things I
dont like Hes been a terrible
husband to all three of his wives
Hes been a destructive force in
the lives of his step-children
Hes cheated the city His partners
His employees Hes paid hundreds of

putting himself through school
Id never met anybody like that
Knew the Bible every word just

there he was at my ear and I
just I didnt want that week to
ever end But it did He came to
say goodbye it was late and I
started to cry and he said not to
worry ‘Behold I send you out as
sheep amidst the wolves And that
just stopped me cold because wed
spent that whole day at Bible study
reading Matthew Ten and there was
just no way for him to know about
that so I was I took it asa
sign I let him in And then
everything was different He was
cruel He was so cruel and I was
so ashamed I thought Id die

INT MILTONS APARTMENT - NIGHT
MILTON

Were coming out guns blazing

The two of you -- all of us --

acquittal after acquittal until

the stench of it reaches so high

into heaven it chokes the whole
fucking lot of them What we

cannot legislate we will buy What
we cannot buy we will degrade We
will blow every fuse of enlightenment
until it looks like a vandalized
neon sign And while God is busy

at his peephole -- as he deigns us
with his disapproval -- as he

lumbers around his empty kingdom

like some overfed colonial governor --
as God sleeps late we will win
Weve got a winner here kids

KEVIN
In the Bible you lose Youre
destined to lose
