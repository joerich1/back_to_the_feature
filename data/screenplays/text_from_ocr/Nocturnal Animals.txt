INT MORROW GALLERY LOS ANGELES PRESENT DAY EVENING 1

Red frizzy hair flies across our screen in slow motion
Glimpses of tinsel and a transparent peignoir momentarily
hide a large pair of sagging breasts swinging from side to
side and bouncing up and down Dead silence as the movement
gradually speeds up to real time We slowly pull back to
reveal that our image is that of a giant nude woman dressed
in nothing but tiny bits of glitter white vinyl boots and a
small tulle cape She is gyrating madly and flinging her head
around in some sort of windstorm As we pull back further we
come to understand that what we are looking at is an art
installation a floor to ceiling LCD screen

The sound of breathing A close up of a woman’s eyes now
fills our screen SUSAN MORROW 42 handsome Sleek There is
a very slight hint of panic on her face as she stares across
the crowded brightly lit room

Abruptly our sound snaps on at a deafening decibel level as
we hear what seems like a thousand voices screaming over each
other

The screens cover the four walls of the gallery and the
effect of wall to wall floor to ceiling breast and ass
jiggling is oddly impressive The obese women on the LCD
screens are nude but dressed in bits and pieces of Americana
one is playing the part of a cheerleader with red tinsel pom
poms one a majorette twirling a baton while another wears a
beauty queen’s ribbon and waves small American flags They
taunt us and tease us

On raised plinths scattered around the room are incredibly
life like sculptures of seemingly the same corpulent women on
our video screens These women appear to be dead and are
lying face down Nude except for jewelry shoes and small
bits of tinsel wrapped around their ankles and waists

The room is jammed with people laughing and talking The
crowd is a collection of what passes in contemporary Los
Angeles culture as the chic and fashionable Photographers
track several of the guests as the flash of their cameras
heightens the excitement in the room

OUR CAMERA GLIDES HIGH ABOVE THE ROOM CAPTURING THE CROWD AND
THE WOMEN ON THEIR PLINTHS

ANGLES AS NIGHTFALL SLOWLY OVERTAKES THE CITY

INT MORROW GALLERY LOS ANGELES NIGHT -- LATER 3

Silence The gallery is now empty A small crew of men in
white shirts and dark ties clear away the last traces of the
party Susan is sitting on one of the plinths deep in
thought A nude sculpture lying face down is behind her The
women on the screens continue to gyrate on all four walls

Susan’s car weaves it’s way through the night

EXT MORROW RESIDENCE LOS ANGELES NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER 5

Susan pulls up to a pair of large stainless steel gates The
glare of her headlights reflects off of the gates and
temporarily blinds her as she shields her eyes She hits the
remote and the massive gates glide open She drives in as the
gates close behind her

As the gates lock in place another car pulls into the
driveway The glare of the headlights blinds us so that we
cannot make out anything but the silhouette of the driver We
see clearly however from the large logo on the hubcap that
the car is a vintage dark brown Mercedes The car door opens
as the driver lowers his foot onto the gravel drive

We cut back to the house to see Susan’s silhouette as she

walks towards the front door The house is dimly lit and
seemingly empty

EXT LOS ANGELES THE NEXT DAY -- MORNING 6

MORNING

EXT MORROW RESIDENCE LOS ANGELES MORNING -- CONTINUOUS 7

Our camera glides across the surface of a black swimming pool
littered with leaves We pull back to reveal a vast unkempt
lawn and a large Jeff Koons “Balloon Dog” sculpture on a
plinth There are tools equipment and a small crane next to
the sculpture Despite the neglected feeling of the grounds
the house is impressive Long low and elegant

INT MORROW RESIDENCE LOS ANGELES MORNING -- CONTINUOUS 8

We move into the living room which is an expanse of grey
carpet and low velvet sofas There are several very large art
crates lining the hall The house is beautiful but cold and
empty

Our camera moves down a long corridor towards a door at the
end The hallway seems endless A large white Calder mobile
moves slowly over a fireplace at the end of the hall as the
breeze from the air-conditioner stirs it

Susan stands underneath the Calder in front of an enormous
television with a remote control in her hand Pressing it
over and over

As we approach the door the sound of the television becomes
louder and louder We can hear two women’s voices as they
shriek with laughter

TELEVISION VOICE 1
And all that decolletage of yours
should get you more dickoletage
than that dude’s got And as I can
recall you were the one that told
me that when he came it was as thin
as coconut water Honey that’s a
deal breaker for me

TELEVISION VOICE 2
It was that thin
TELEVISION VOICE 1
Well I see we’re settling for less
now

The women break into hysterical laughter once again

We cut to Susan’s face Her mouth literally hangs open as she
stands staring at the television and holding the remote in
her hand trying to get the television to turn off

SUSAN
Beyond

She tosses the remote on the bed in disgust and walks out of
the room leaving the television still on

INT MORROW RESIDENCE - ENTRY HALL MORNING -- CONTINUOUS 9

CHRISTOPHER 38 wearing a dark suit and tie is placing the
mail on a small desk

CHRISTOPHER
Mrs Morrow a package arrived for
you I found it in the mailbox this
morning May I ask you who you
would like on duty this weekend

SUSAN
Actually why don’t you give
everyone the weekend off

CHRISTOPHER
Are you sure

SUSAN
Yes We might go to the beach house
and if not it might be nice to have
the weekend alone

CHRISTOPHER
Ill let everyone know

SUSAN
Thank you

Susan stares at the package for a moment It is a simple box
wrapped in plain brown paper

Susan begins to rip the wrapping off of the box As she does
she cuts her finger on the edge of the paper
She winces looks at the blood and then quickly puts her
finger in her mouth

SUSAN (CONTD)
Damn it Christopher I’m sorry but
could you help me open this I just
cut my finger Paper cut

CHRISTOPHER
Of course

SUSAN
Thank you

Christopher rips the paper off of the package Inside is a
neat grey linen archival box and a hand written note

CHRISTOPHER
There’s a note

SUSAN
It’s okay You can read it

Christopher reads the note aloud

CHRISTOPHER
Dear Susan

I’ve written a novel that will be
published in the spring It’s
different than the kind of things
that I was writing when we were
together

Christopher pauses and looks up

SUSAN
Go ahead

CHRISTOPHER
In the end you left me with the
inspiration that I needed to write
from the heart I wanted you to be
the first to read it so I am
sending along a proof

(MORE )

CHRISTOPHER (CONTD)
I will be in LA until Wednesday on

business and it would be good to
see you after so long

My cell number and e-mail address
are below

Edward
Susan stands stunned for a moment

SUSAN
Thanks

Christopher places the note back on the box and leaves the
room Susan’s gaze is transfixed as she stares down at the
note

She picks up the box and carries it into the kitchen

INT MORROW RESIDENCE - KITCHEN MORNING -- CONTINUOUS 10

HUTTON MORROW 44 years old tall athletic and well groomed
dressed in a crisp white button down shirt blue blazer and
grey pants enters the room Hutton’s face gives away the
fact that he has not slept

Susan is washing the cut on her finger at the sink

HUTTON
Good morning

SUSAN
Good morning

HUTTON
What is that

SUSAN
It’s a manuscript that Edward sent
me He wrote a novel

HUTTON

SUSAN
Edward my first husband Remember
him
HUTTON
I didn’t know he could write

SUSAN
Yes you did He was writing a novel
when you and got together you just
don’t remember

HUTTON
Have you even talked to him in 20
years

SUSAN

19 No I tried calling him a
couple of times a few years ago but
he just hung up on me I think he’s
teaching English at some prep
school in Dallas It’s sad really
He never remarried

Hutton is not really listening He is putting a Nespresso pod
into the coffee machine

SUSAN (CONT’‘D)
Where were you last night You
didn’t come by the gallery

HUTTON
I’m sorry Really By the time I
left the office I was late for my
dinner

SUSAN
It would have taken you 15 minutes
15 minutes and it would have meant
a lot to me (Pause) Never mind

She turns away from him

SUSAN (CONTD)
You didn’t come to bed last night

HUTTON
I didn’t want to wake you up

SUSAN
Well I wasn’t asleep I was too
wound up from the opening
Hutton tosses his newspaper on the counter and begins to
read

SUSAN (CONTD)
It went well by the way
Apparently

HUTTON
Good

Susan crosses the room to Hutton

SUSAN
Look Why don’t you and I go to the
beach We can go tonight and come
back on Monday Maybe if we just
spent some time just the two of
us

Susan glances up at him

SUSAN (CONTD)
Why are you wearing this blazer on
a Saturday

HUTTON
Because I have to go to the office
and then I have to go to the
airport and then I have to go back
to New York

SUSAN
You just came from there

HUTTON
Yes I know But I have to go if I
want to get this deal done I don’t
want to have to sell anything else

Hutton is ripping a packet of sweetener open and he spills it
on the counter

HUTTON (CONTD)
Shit

Susan begins sweeping it away

SUSAN
It’s okay

Susan looks at

You

crate in the hall

SUSAN (CONTD)

I don’t really care about all of
this art

HUTTON

That doesn’t sound like you

SUSAN

I know But it’s true

HUTTON

I care It pisses me off

SUSAN

I know you do

She pauses a m

Don’

SUSAN (CONTD)

1 Susan and Hutton are greeted with cheek

Susan stands talking with ALESSIA HOLT 38 dressed in a
kaftan and covered in gold and turquoise jewelry She is
tall pale and her eyes are darkened with heavy liner and
even heavier shadow so that she almost has the appearance of
a raccoon She moves her hands wildly when she speaks She is
flamboyant but there is a kindness and gentle quality about
her The two women are clearly close as is evident by their
easy rapport

ALESSIA
Are things a little better

SUSAN
He’s just having a hard time with

his business right now

They glance across the room at Hutton who is speaking with
CARLOS HOLT early 50’s silver hair tall and elegant

ALESSIA
Carlos told me

SUSAN
I’m surprised I thought we were
hiding it pretty well Hutton would
be very upset to find out that
anyone knew He just hates not to
win

She looks over at him

ALESSIA
Are you sleeping Did you call my
psychopharmacologist

She takes a sip of her martini

ALESSIA (CONTD)
Did you call him You should
because he’s a genius

Hutton has pulled away from Carlos and stepped into the hall
He is on his phone Susan watches him

Alessia reaches out and touches Susan’s arm

ALESSIA (CONTD)
Susan I’m worried about you

Susan is focused on Hutton who is still on his phone

ALESSIA (CONTD)
Seriously look at me You scared
me the last time that we talked

She looks at Alessia and her shoulders droop She feels
comfortable enough with Alessia to let a certain fragility

show

SUSAN
I’m fine I’m fine I just can’t
believe I told you all of those
things I feel embarrassed about
it What right do I have to not be
happy I have everything I feel
ungrateful not to be happy

ALESSIA
As much right as anyone Susan As
much right as anyone because it’s
all relative You’re just awfully
hard on yourself

Susan looks across the room at Carlos

SUSAN
How do you do it

ALESSIA
You mean with Carlos I’m totally
cool with it Having a gay husband
is not such a bad thing We’re best
friends We love each other
completely I’m certainly the only
woman in his life And that lasts
longer than lust doesn’t it It’s
forever really

Alessia glances towards Hutton

SUSAN
Hutton and I don’t have that

ALESSIA
Did you ever

SUSAN
I think we just want different
things Or maybe I want different
things

ALESSIA
Do you still love him

She looks up and Hutton catches her eyes and motions to her
with his head

SUSAN
I’m being summoned Pardon me He
has to catch a plane I need to say
goodbye

Susan crosses the room to Hutton and leads him to the door
Alessia stares after her

EXT HOLT RESIDENCE BEL AIR CALIFORNIA NIGHT -
CONTINUOUS

We are on the front steps of the house There is a black
Mercedes and driver waiting for Hutton

SUSAN
I hope that this deal works out for
you I really do I know that you
need it

HUTTON
We need this

SUSAN
No you need this

She leans in to kiss him on the cheek She watches the car
pull out of the driveway and goes back into the house

INT HOLT RESIDENCE BEL AIR CALIFORNIA NIGHT -- LATER 14

The flamboyant and eclectic guests are seated around the
dining table finishing dessert Conversation at the table is
lively and somewhat loud Susan is seated next to Carlos

At that moment the other end of the table erupts with
laughter as CHLOE 24 a beautiful young actress finishes a
story She speaks with a strong southern accent and has a
certain vapid charm The table is riveted

CHLOE
So I said “well my mother always
told me if you massage your pussy
with Pam Cooking Spray for a month
before the baby comes you won’t
need vaginal rejuvenation”

The table burst into hysterical laughter Susan turns back to
Carlos

SUSAN
Ive got to get some Pam And she
is going to get a nomination this
year

CARLOS
A nomination She is going to win

They both look towards Chloe

CARLOS (CONTD)
Let’s talk about your opening My
favorite subject

SUSAN
Not mine
CARLOS
The opening was spectacular last
night
SUSAN
Really Is that what you thought
CARLOS
You didn’t
SUSAN
No
CARLOS

I loved it I thought the work was
incredibly strong So perfect with
all of this junk culture that we
live in

SUSAN
It is junk Total junk

CARLOS
Darling you’re a big success None
of us really like what we do

SUSAN
So why do we do it

CARLOS
Because we are driven And maybe a
bit insecure We get into things
when we’re young because we think
they mean something

SUSAN
And then we find out that they
don’t

CARLOS

Susan enjoy the absurdity of our
world It’s a lot less painful And
believe me our world is a lot less
painful than the real world

moment She opens her medicine cabinet and takes two
different pills

LATER

One wall of the room is all glass The view across the lawn
and down to the city is dramatic and eerie at the same time

As Susan sits down on the bed her eyes catch the cover of
“Nocturnal Animals” on her bedside table She pauses then
picks up the manuscript and opens it to the first page

She is momentarily taken aback by the dedication The clean
white page reads simply “For Susan”

She begins to read

We are in the driveway of a modest but well designed ranch
styled house A large oak tree looms over the lawn and the
sound of cicadas can be heard

TONY HASTINGS early 40s dark brown hair with a full beard
is loading bags into the back of a vintage 4 door brown
Mercedes He is dressed in jeans and a red plaid shirt INDIA
HASTINGS 16 is helping him She is tall and slim with long
red hair

INDIA
Dad why are we driving this old
thing to Marfa

Because I just had it completely
rebuilt It’s a classic

She throws a bag in the trunk

TONY

He lifts a pair of riding boots into the back of the car

TONY (CONTD)
You have two sets of boots India

INDIA

Ask your mother She’s the boss

LAURA HASTINGS 40 shoulder length red hair slim and pretty
like her daughter comes out of the house with a small bag

out of the driveway and into the twilight

Driving out of the sprawl that is Houston and into the
country until the highway stretches out straight ahead

INDIA

something

The road is even more flat and straight now The highway is
increasingly deserted and has narrowed to two lanes on each
side Every few minutes a car passes them in the left lane or
the headlights of an oncoming car can be seen across the

median

INT HASTINGS

CAR NIGHT -- LATER 19

Silence in the car Tony is driving and Laura and India are
asleep Tony is fumbling to find a radio station but none are

within range

Tony looks over at Laura and touches her cheek She opens her
eyes for a moment smiles at him and kisses his hand

Straight ahead on the highway Tony sees two sets of tail
lights blocking both lanes of the road Tony has to slow his
speed and he gets behind the car on the left and waits Both
cars are now slowing down even more

TONY
Come on

Tony presses his horn lightly Laura and India wake up The
car in the left lane an old dark green metallic Pontiac GTO
with a dented fender finally pulls ahead and Tony follows He
zooms past the first car an old dark red Cadillac
convertible and gets back into the right lane as the green
GTO speeds off into the distance The Cadillac falls behind

The GTO in front now begins to slow down as well As Tony
passes the car the driver leans back into his seat and
laughs There are two other men in the car but we cannot see
their faces

INDIA
Total Jerks

TONY
Are we rid of them

India gives them the finger from the rear window

LAURA
India don’t do that

TONY
What What did she do

LAURA
She just gave them the finger

The driver of the green GTO now steps on the gas and begins
to gain on Tony

LAURA (CONTD)
Tony Speed up

INDIA
Shit

LAURA
No I don’t like this

TONY
It’s alright

LAURA
Just speed up Tony

The dark green GTO is now honking and roars up beside the
family

INDIA
Shit

LAURA
Just let them go Let them go

The three men in the car are staring at the family and
laughing

TONY
India don’t look at them Don’t
give them any reason

The man in the passenger side of the car is looking at India
with a lascivious grin on his face The other men in the car
are laughing

INDIA
Why is he smiling like that

Suddenly the green GTO lunges sideways towards Tony’s car
forcing him to swerve The GTO then pulls in front of the
Mercedes and cuts them off

TONY
He’s crazy

LAURA
Oh my god

Tony pulls out to pass the car but as he does the car in
front swings left to block his way and Tony hits his brakes
As Tony swerves back to the right the GTO cuts him off again
preventing him from passing In a surge of rage Tony steps on
the gas

A loud metallic crashing noise He hits them

TONY
Fuck

Tony shocked at what has just happened steps on the gas and
gets around the other car As he passes the GTO the driver is
waving madly and screaming at him to pull over and stop

LAURA
Oh god Tony

The lights of the GTO grow distant as Tony speeds away The
car is quiet as the family sit stunned at what just happened

TONY
India is your phone working yet

INDIA
No but I took down their license
number

As Tony checks his rear view mirror he sees a pair of
headlights beginning to gain on him

TONY
No

Laura looks in the side view mirror and sees the car
approaching

LAURA
Oh no

The GTO now roars up beside them on the left and the guy in
the passenger seat is waving his arms violently at them
shouting shaking his fist and pointing The car swerves
towards them and tries to force Tony onto the shoulder Tony
keeps his foot on the peddle and keeps his hands gripped
firmly on the steering wheel

The green GTO suddenly rams into the Mercedes pulls back and
then rams them again and again forcing Tony to move towards
the shoulder of the road as he begins to loose control of the
car

Another crashing sound against his left fender and he feels
the damage The GTO pushes against him continuously and holds
steady The loud raw grating noise of metal ripping at metal
is deafening

Tony’s steering wheel begins to rattle and shake as the other
car forces him off of the road and lands in front of him ina
cloud of dust and gravel

Shaken by what she has just read Susan tries to catch her
breath She turns the page

EXT HIGHWAY WEST TEXAS NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS 21

As the dust settles as we can see clearly that the Hasting’s
car is blocked in by the other car Laura looks back to make
sure that India is okay as the second car the convertible
that was lagging behind comes into sight We see the wide
grin of the shirtless driver as the car slows and then speeds
away

The family sits in shock trying to figure out what to do

The drivers side of the old Buick opens and a man RAY
MARCUS late 20s rough looking yet surprisingly handsome
steps out Laura reaches for Tony’s arm The other men in the
car are looking on but we do not make out their faces
clearly

TONY
Sit still They’ve probably got a
gun

LAURA

Please Tony Pull out

TONY
I can’t move He’s blocked the car

The man walks around to the back of his car to survey the
damage He begins to talk to the man in the front passenger
seat

TONY (CONTD)
What’s he doing

He then walks over to Tony’s car Slowly He is wearing a
western shirt jeans and bright green cowboy boots He looks
at the front of Tony’s car and comes to the window

LAURA
Don’t get out of the car

TONY
I’m not getting out of the car

Ray motions for Tony to roll down his window Tony does this
reluctantly

RAY
Good evenin

Ray smiles

TONY
Good evening

RAY

is an accident

TONY

RAY
Then why didn’t you stop then

The man leans down and looks inside the car at Laura and
India India is trying to get a signal with her phone again

RAY (CONTD)
That won’t work No signal here

He looks at Tony again
RAY (CONTD)
You’re not supposed to leave the

scene of an accident It’s a crime

LAURA
After the way you were driving

TONY
Laura

RAY
What did you say

Ray’s hand is resting on top of the Mercedes He is tapping
his fingers on the roof of the car over and over We can see
clearly the twinkle of a pink diamond heart shaped girl’s
ring on his little finger His dirty nails are long and that
of someone who plays the guitar He has the swagger of a
seventies rock star

LAURA
Just that the way you were driving
was crazy

Ray bangs his hand on the roof of the car and spits

RAY
Hey Turk

The doors on the right side of the Buick open and the two men
get out TURK who is the smallest of the three and LOU who is
tall and thin with a dead look in his eyes Both men wear old
baseball hats

Ray puts his hands on the half opened window and leans in

LAURA
Don’t come any closer

TONY
Alright sweetheart it’s alright

The other men begin approaching the car

LAURA
You know what please just get back
in your car Leave us alone

RAY
Lady lady lady Calm down We

One of the men shines his flashlight at Laura

LAURA
Leave us alone

TONY

putting their hands on the hood and leaning down under the
car We cannot see what they are doing

TONY

across the car door He smiles

TONY

Ray breaks into hysterical laughter as he claws with his
nails at the window imitating a kitten The family sits
dumbstruck as the other men laugh along with Ray

TONY
You know what we should call the
police

RAY

Oh It’s a great idea It was your
fuckin fault right

The two men in front walk around to the side of the car

boxes in the light of the flashlight held by Turk until they
get at the spare tire

car is moving at very high speed clearly on a call Tony
steps towards the road and waves his arms Laura and India
run towards the road screaming They are too late and shout
frantically into the night as the police car speeds off into
the distance Ray holds his breath for a moment and then he
and the other two men start laughing

RAY (CONTD)
There goes your cops You should
have tried harder to stop them But

The men continue to work on the car They seem to enjoy it
and laugh and talk Ray is not laughing

Ray paces back and forth while the other two men finish
changing the tire Ray looks periodically over at Laura and
India tapping his feet and murmuring under his breath

RAY (CONTD)

tries to push Ray away from India but is blocked by Turk who
throws her to the ground Ray picks India up and begins to
carry her to the front of the car The two women begin
screaming as the situation becomes more violent Tony finally
breaks free from Lou and moves in towards the car only to be
held back once again

India breaks free and runs down the road as Ray stands
catching his breath He calls after her as he rubs his
crotch

pavement

Ray is now right in Tony’s face as the two men stand
screaming at each other Laura runs to the car and shouts at
Tony and India to get in the car

LAURA

There is a rush of motion the men are startled India runs
to the car and makes her way around to the rear door and into
the backseat slamming and locking the door behind her Laura
also jumps into the front seat and locks the door

Ray has now moved away from Tony and towards the Mercedes

RAY
Hey Here we go Go in both cars
Hey Lou

Ray runs around to the driver’s side of the Mercedes and
starts to jump in just before Laura realizes too late what is
happening and is not able to reach across and lock the door
He braces the door open with his foot as Laura scratches and
claws at him as he tries to get in

As Tony looks up he sees Turk reach around and unlock the
back door as India bites him and screams He fights her off
and pushes his way into the car as Ray slams the driver’s
door and starts the car

INDIA
Dad Dad

Tony stares at what is happening in complete disbelief He
freezes and stands for a moment paralyzed India’s scream
pierces the silence of the night and finally pulls him back
to reality He snaps to and moves towards the car but
immediately Lou is upon him

With a violent roar the car pulls onto the highway and speeds
away

TONY
No No

Tony sees the horrified faces of his wife and daughter as the
car rushes away India’s tear streaked face staring back at

him from the rear window The sound of the car fades and the
red tail lights grow fainter and then disappear all together

trailer partially hidden behind a cluster of mesquite trees

shotgun cartridges Tony comes to a stop

He gets into the car slams the door jerks forward and
starts back up the deserted road Tony chases after the car
and bangs on the door as Lou kicks the dust up in Tony’s
face

Tony watches the red lights disappear Except for the light
of the vast sky and the sound of coyotes in the distance the
night is completely black

Tony sits down on the ground and starts to cry He pounds his
fists into his legs

EXT DESERT WEST TEXAS NIGHT -- LATER 26

Tony hears a faint but steady whooshing sound in the
distance and then the far away cry of what could be the horn
of a large truck The sounds come from the opposite direction
of the dirt road Tony stands up thinks and starts walking
in the direction of the sound

As he does we see lights coming along down the dirt road The
car stops at the clearing where Tony was kicked out Two men
get out Although it is not completely clear the car looks
like Tony’s Mercedes

Tony sees the beam of a flashlight and flattens himself
reflexively behind a large boulder and a clump of brush at
the edge of the arroyo

RAY
What did you fuckin leave him out
here for

LOU
Hey mister Your wife wants you

Tony holds still

RAY
Get back in the fuckin car

LOU
Mister Your wife wants you

Silence Footsteps in the brush very close by

LOU (CONTD)
Mister Ah Shit

The men get back in the car and slam the doors The lights of
the car illuminate the top of the grass and brush like a
movie stage After a moment the car turns back down the dusty
road

Tony stays flat against the ground Silence The sounds of
the desert In the distance the whooshing sound seems louder
than before
Tony pulls himself up and starts walking towards the sound

As Tony walks through the desert brush the sky begins to
lighten a bit to a deep violet

Tony climbs down an arroyo and crawls under a barbed wire
fence As he does he falls to the ground and twists his
ankle The sky is beginning to turn a light pink

Tony wanders along the highway signaling and waving his arms
to get someone to stop but no one does He keeps walking and

banging on the door furiously A woman in shorts answers We

Tony is standing stunned His eyes are wet In the distance
there is a three sided concrete pen filled with what is left
of burned garbage In the middle of the garbage is a charred
and ripped red velvet sofa that someone has thrown out Lying
on the sofa we see what seems to be a pair of naked lovers
intertwined They do not move Their white skin gleams in the
hot sun

Tony begins to move slowly towards the lovers and lowers
himself to his knees in front of them

The two of them look small Like children White and naked in
the bright daylight Bobby lifts the girl’s head gently in
his hand Tony sees her face from the side her long red hair
tangled in the blood across her mouth

Tony is in shock and can’t speak Bobby lowers India’s head
carefully back onto the arm of the sofa and climbs over
slowly to the other side He pushes the other body back
gently by the shoulders Tony stares at the dark red hair

He sees Laura’s mouth open like she is crying out her cheeks
and eyes contorted with pain Bobby Andes holds her head up
for him to see Her small gold cross dangles from her neck
and catches the sun

Susan at 22 is coming out of the door of Bergdorf’s and turns
to walk uptown There is a young man lingering in the next
doorway watching her He steps out just ahead of her and
walks in the same direction she is walking He walks slower
than she does and they are now only a few feet apart She
realizes that she knows him or thinks she knows him She
quickens her pace

You know you were my first crush
when we were at Hastings I really
only spent so much time with your
brother to be around you
SUSAN
And you were his first crush

EDWARD
What I had no idea Cooper was gay

SUSAN
I don’t think he did either Then
But he was obsessed with you If I
hadn’t caught you looking at me all
the time I would have thought the
two of you were sleeping together

EDWARD
I feel terrible that I haven’t
spoken to him in a few years I
haven’t been a very good friend I
hope that I didn’t hurt him

SUSAN
You’re good you know Most guys
would be freaked out to find out
that their best friend had been in
love with them Call him he’d like
that My parents have basically
disowned him They don’t really
speak anymore

EDWARD
Why

SUSAN
Are you kidding You know my
parents Religious conservative
sexist racist materialistic
Republican narcissistic

EDWARD
What do you really think Susan

SUSAN
It’s true They’re pretty narrow
They look at us as just an
extension of themselves They can’t
accept Cooper for who he is I’m
not sure how I will fare

EDWARD
Aren’t you being a little hard on
them

SUSAN
No I don’t think so They have a
pretty antiquated idea about how I
am supposed to live my life My
mother especially

EDWARD
Ive always loved your mother She
was great with me when my father
died

Edward looks at her

EDWARD (CONTD)
You both have the same kind of
sadness in your eyes

SUSAN
What

EDWARD
You and your mother

SUSAN
What a weird thing to say

EDWARD
I’m sorry I hope that doesn’t
offend you But she has always
seemed sad to me She has sad eyes
I’ve thought that since I was a
little boy You have the same eyes
They’re beautiful

SUSAN
Please don’t say that I don’t want
to be like my mother

EDWARD
I always envied your family I felt
like a complete imposter at school

felt that way

EDWARD
You

SUSAN
I tried so hard to seem perfect

EDWARD
And you don’t feel that way

SUSAN
No

Edward looks at her He smiles

EDWARD
But that’s exactly what makes you
so perfect

SUSAN
You’1l definitely make a great
novelist You’ve created a
completely fictitious character in
your head

EDWARD
No I don’t believe that

He looks into her eyes

EDWARD (CONTD)
Why did you give up on becoming an
artist

SUSAN
I’m too cynical to be an artist I
think to be good you have to
create from some sort of place
inside that I’m not sure that I
have

EDWARD
You really underestimate yourself
you know

Susan stares directly into Edward’s eyes

SUSAN
Would you come home with me

EDWARD
Wow That’s is a bit forward Not
what I’d expect from a Texas
debutante

SUSAN
You know debutantes are all sluts

suffocated

He waits for Tony to take this in

ANDES (CONTD)
She also had a broken arm

He watches Tony He pauses

ANDES (CONTD)
And they had both been raped

Tony stares blankly ahead

BOBBY
You were also right about that
trailer

TONY
How

ANDES

I mean your friends took your folks
there just like you thought

TONY
How do you know that

ANDES
We found your wife’s finger prints
on the bed post

TONY
Whose trailer is it

ANDES
He’s clear Guy who lives in El
Paso The place had been broken
into Someone’s been living in it
We got other prints too in the
trailer We’ll have to check them
against the owner’s and see if we
can separate them out But I’m
hopeful The owner hasn’t been
there since last fall (Pause) It
looks promising

Tony looks up at Andes

TONY
Promising

INT MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BEDROOM NIGHT -- LATER 47

Susan lies in her bed deep in thought

FLASHBACK - INT HIGHLAND PARK GRILL ROOM DALLAS TEXAS 48
1996 -- EVENING

Susan and her mother ANNE SUTTON 48 are having dinner The
atmosphere at the table is tense

ANNE
Why didn’t you tell me this before

Susan’s mother sits quietly fuming She speaks calmly but
there is an edge to her voice

ANNE (CONT’D)
You are actually going to leave New
York and move to Austin to go to
the god damned University of Texas
I thought you loved Columbia
(MORE )

ANNE (CONT’D)
What happened to their “great art
history department”

She pauses a moment

Susan why are you doing this I
mean where is this going to go

SUSAN
What do you mean where is it going
to go I’m going to marry Edward
That’s where it’s going to go

ANNE
This is a ridiculous conversation
Youre too young to get married

SUSAN
Oh really Didn’t you try to
convince me just last summer that I
should marry Bass

ANNE
That was different Bass is your
equal

SUSAN

Oh my god did you just say that
You really just said that That
came out of your mouth

ANNE
Why do you always think the worst
of me That is not what I meant
What I meant is that you are very
very strong willed and as sweet as
he is Edward is just too weak for
you

SUSAN
Weak isn’t the word I would use to
describe Edward Sensitive is the
word I would use and that’s
certainly not a word that I could
ever use to describe anyone in this
family except maybe Cooper
ANNE
Don’t bring Cooper into this Come
on Susan You may not think that we
care about the same things but
you’re wrong In a few years all
these “bourgeois” things as you so
like to call them will become very
important to you Edward won’t be
able to give them to you He has no
money He’s not driven He’s not
ambitious And if you marry Edward
I can promise you that your father
is not going to give them to you
either

SUSAN
No he’s not driven in the way that
you want him to be but you’re
wrong He’s strong Stronger than I
am in a lot of ways He just has a
different kind of strength

ANNE
A different kind of strength And
what kind of strength is that

SUSAN
The strength to believe in himself
To believe in me

Anne collects herself and leans into the table

ANNE
Susan keep seeing him if you have
to Live with him I don’t care
but don’t marry him I understand
what you see in Edward I get it

Susan starts to turn her head away

ANNE (CONT’D)
No wait I do He’s the opposite of
your father He’s a romantic but
he’s also very fragile I saw that
when his father died

SUSAN
When did you become so
compassionate and understanding

Anne glares at her

ANNE
Don’t do this You’ll regret it and
you’1l only hurt Edward in the end
What you love about him now you’1l
hate about him in a few years You
may not realize it but you and I
are a lot more alike than you
think

Anne spots a piece of lint on Susan’s sweater She reaches
forward and pulls it off Susan watches her mother do this
and recoils slightly

SUSAN
You’re wrong You and I are nothing
alike

ANNE

Really Just wait We all
eventually turn into our mothers

Anne turns away from Susan and takes a sip of her martini

A bleak hillside Brown grass and bare trees as Tony appears
over the hill in his running clothes He has on a light
jacket and long tight running pants He is clean shaven He
looks thinner It is remarkable how he now looks almost
exactly like Edward Dark circles ring his eyes and a certain
dead quality is evident in his expression

TONY VO
I know it was him

ANDES VO
Well that may be but nobody’s seen
him around here lately Now listen
I’ve got to be honest with you
Right now it’s not looking good
Sometimes these cases go for months

need to prepare yourself for that

close to Lou’s

TONY

prints on both the car and the
trailer

TONY
Then he went back to the trailer
after leaving me

ANDES
Looks like it Probably he went
back and told them where he left
you and that’s why they went back
with the bodies They were going to
kill you I’m betting your friend
Ray is the third guy in the holdup

TONY
Now what

ANDES
You’1l have to come back for the
trial Meanwhile I’m gonna find
Ray

INT MORROW GALLERY - SUSAN’S OFFICE NEXT MORNING 60

Alex sits

SUSAN

ALEX
You didn’t sleep again did you

down

SUSAN
You know me I never sleep My ex
husband used to call me a
“nocturnal animal”

ALEX
Your ex husband What ex husband I
didn’t know that you had an ex
husband Since when

SUSAN
When I was in graduate school It
was only for a couple of years
It’s weird I’ve been thinking
about him a lot lately and then a
few days ago he sent me a book he’s
written It’s violent and it’s sad
He called it “Nocturnal Animals”
and dedicated it to me

ALEX
Did you love him

SUSAN
Yes I loved him He was a writer
I didn’t have faith in him I
panicked and I did something
horrible to him Something
unforgivable Really

ALEX
You left him

SUSAN
I left him In a brutal way for
the handsome and dashing Hutton

ALEX
Who is indeed very handsome and
dashing

SUSAN

Yes Do you ever feel like your
life has turned into something that
you never intended

She looks at her and pauses a moment

No Of course you don’t You just

started living your life

She looks closely at Susan

ALEX
You really didn’t get any sleep did
you

SUSAN
No

INT MUSEUM EXHIBITION SPACE LOS ANGELES THAT AFTERNOON 61

Our screen is filled with the image of a Damien Hirst calf
floating in formaldehyde The calf has been shot with arrows
Our camera pulls back and we see that Susan is standing
staring quietly at the sculpture

The space is gigantic and white A show is being installed
There are graphic abstract paintings on the walls

As Susan turns to walk away a painting catches her eye and
she stops dead in her tracks It is a large black and white
painting that says REVENGE

SAGE ROSS 38 walks over to Susan She is the museum’s
director and is tense and tight in her manner She is dressed
in an absurd “conceptual” top and flat men’s shoes

SUSAN
Where did this come from

SAGE
What do you mean where did it come
from You bought it for us Don’t
you remember It was part of the
series we showed about 8 years ago
Great isn’t it

SUSAN
Yes

Sage is holding a phone with a black and white image on the
screen and the loud sound of breathing coming from it

SUSAN (CONTD)
What is that

SAGE
Oh my god it is so cool It is an
app that let’s me watch Willow
while she is sleeping in her crib

SUSAN
Really Do you not trust your
nanny

SAGE

No I do but I hate her And I
like to be more involved with
Willow during the day Here look
There she is in her crib The sound
is amazing I can hear her breathe
and even talk to her if I want to

Sage hands the phone to Susan who stares at the black and

white image of the little girl in her crib As she watches

she sees someone move behind the crib and then for a quick
second she sees Ray look directly into the camera

Susan gasps and drops the phone to the ground shattering the
screen

SUSAN
Oh my god I’m so sorry

SAGE
Are you okay

SUSAN
I thought I saw someone

SAGE
Of course you saw someone It’s
Willow She’s asleep in her crib

Sage bends down to the floor and picks up the phone It is
still working and the little girl is sleeping peacefully in
her crib

SUSAN
I’m sorry about the screen

SAGE
It’s all right the new ones come
out next week

Susan is still shaken

SAGE (CONTD)
Shall we Everyone is waiting in
the conference room

62 INT MUSEUM CONFERENCE ROOM AFTERNOON -- MINUTES LATER 62

We are viewing the scene from behind glass A group of people
sit around a table They are talking and looking over
financial statements Susan stares into space She sits at
the head of the table She is deep in thought

CLOSE-UP SHOTS OF TONYEDWARD WE CAN’T TELL WHICH HE IS
LYING IN BED DISTRAUGHT WE ARE INTIMATE WITH HIM AND CAN
ALMOST FEEL HIM BREATHE

63 INT MUSEUM CONFERENCE ROOM AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS 63
Our camera moves into the room

SAGE
Anyway I think we have to cut her
loose She’s not what she sold
herself as when we hired her

Another member of the group LINDA ADDISON 50 speaks up Her
breasts are oddly oversized and squeezed into a tiny top

LINDA
I disagree I think we should keep
her for now

SAGE
Why

LINDA
Because she’s great Because we all
like her She just needs our
support And a bit of time

SAMANTHA VAN HELSING 45 interrupts Linda Her face fills
our screen She is stretched and pulled to the extreme Her
lips are swollen and her general appearance is close to that
of a burn victim

SAMANTHA
But it’s not working We need to
fire her There’s an awesome
candidate that we could steal from
the Hammer if we move fast

Susan is all of a sudden alert

SUSAN
I agree with Linda We hired her
and we need to support her

The room is surprised by Susan’s response

Susan looks at Samantha She is taken a back and looks at her
almost as though she has never seen her before

SUSAN (CONTD)
New doctor

Samantha glares at her

SAMANTHA
No New haircut

SAGE
But Susan you were the one who
brought this up last week You
wanted to make a change

SUSAN
Well now I think we should keep
her

She looks at Samantha’s swollen lips

SUSAN (CONTD)
Sometimes maybe it’s not a good
idea to change things quite so
much

INT MORROW RESIDENCE LOS ANGELES THAT EVENING 64

Susan walks into the house Dead silence She places her bag
in the entry hall She stares out at the lawn It is dusk and
the city lights are just becoming visible through the mist
The large plinth that held the Koons is now empty and the
lawn cleaned up She walks through the living room which is
now immaculate but bare Susan pours herself a drink The
white Calder moves in the breeze from the air conditioner
Susan is alone

She walks to the window with her drink in her hand and stares
out across the lights of Los Angeles

EXT DESERTED ROAD WEST TEXAS AFTERNOON 65
Bobby and Tony stand outside of Tony’s car on a dirt road

Bobby is smoking a cigarette He looks drawn and gaunt His

then buckles over for a moment

EXT RAY’S MOBILE HOME AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS 66

The two men walk through the scruffy trees until they can see
a mobile home and an old wooden deck about a hundred feet
away Ray is sitting on a toilet that has been installed
outside on the deck There is a beer beside him He is
shirtless his pants are down around his ankles and he is on
a cordless phone smoking a cigarette

ANDES
His name is Ray Marcus and someone
named him as a frequent companion
of Lou Bates and Steve Adams

Tony stares harder Clearly agitated

ANDES (CONTD)
Part time electrician Part time
plumber hence the clever toilet
facilities Not a bad match to both
your description and the fella in
the holdup No fingerprints but we
knew that before

TONY
I wonder why there aren’t any
finger prints

ANDES
His hands were probably on your
wife

Tony winces

ANDES (CONTD)
His record is clean except for a
rape charge that was dropped I got
out of the barman at a place called
“Line Camp Bar” that he lives here
with a girl called Leila and that
he keeps another place to pick up
women that she doesn’t know about
Probably your murder trailer before
it got notorious Does he look like
he could be the guy

TONY
Yeah That’s him

ANDES
Good Let’s go talk to him

Andes walks out of the brush

ANDES (CONT’D)
Hey Ray

INT MORROW RESIDENCE - LIVINGROOM NIGHT 69

Susan is startled away from the book by the sound of the fire
flaring up in the fireplace She is lying on the sofa reading
and looks up and stares at the flames

FLASHBACK - INT EDWARD AND SUSAN’S APARTMENT AUSTIN 199770
-- NIGHT

A white brick fireplace holds a dying fire Susan is lying on
a red velvet sofa reading loose printed pages She is
concentrating
EDWARD
Is it better

Susan looks up slowly She sighs

SUSAN
Youll take this the wrong way but
I think that you need to stop
writing about yourself

EDWARD
But no one ever writes about
anything but themselves

Edward looks down at the ground

SUSAN
I know But I don’t know what else
to say My mind started to wander
while I was reading which is not a
good thing

Edward is clearly devastated

EDWARD
Maybe I need a break from it

SUSAN
Maybe you do

EDWARD
I don’t know what to do Maybe I
don’t have a book in me

SUSAN
Get some space from it

EDWARD
Please don’t start that again It
makes me feel like you don’t
believe in me

SUSAN
I didn’t say that

EDWARD
No but your face says it Your
little “sighs” say it The way you
keep telling me that I should go
back to school says it

SUSAN
I do think you should go back to
school I think you need to be
realistic I mean come on you’re
really smart A part time job ina
book store and writing a novel is a
romantic idea but is this really
our life Is this what it’s going
to be For how long

EDWARD
You sound just like your mother

SUSAN
Well you always said I was so like
her That’s why I hate reading your
work You always get so fucking
defensive about it

EDWARD
Of course I’m defensive Do you
know what it’s like to put yourself
out on a limb creatively and then
to have someone you love read what
you’ve written and not understand
it

SUSAN
No I don’t because I’m not
creative Edward

EDWARD
That’s because you’ve chosen not to
be

She glares at him

EDWARD (CONT’D)
I don’t want to fight I’m tired
and I’m edgy and I’ve been writing
all night I just wanted you to
like it

talking on the phone to Tony

ANDES
I’ve got some news you won’t like

TONY
What What do you mean they’re
letting him go

ANDES

The DA says there is not enough
hard evidence and that the evidence
that there is is circumstantial
He needs corroboration

Tony is silent

ANDES (CONTD)
I’m real sorry Tony It’s a god
damned shame At least you got to
lay a good belt on him

TONY
No that’s not enough What else
can we do

ANDES

They want to push me out They have
someone else they want to put in

talking about Would they drop a
murder case to do that

ANDES
Gives them the reason They said
the case wasn’t well prepared was
a sloppy job slapdash no
evidence evidence gathered
improperly won’t stand up in
court The DA is too much of a
chicken shit to take on a case that
he might loose

Tony mulls this over

ANDES (CONTD)
They’re not dropping Lou

get Ray

casts a bright light into the car and on his face A small
crowd is gathered outside of the entrance Two obese women in
shorts sit in lawn chairs drinking beer One woman has her
beer between her breasts and she is wearing a paper crown
from a fast food restaurant

After a while two men come out Ray and Andes They talk in
the glow of the sign Two policemen appear at the door Andes
gestures and one of the policemen touches Ray’s shoulder He
recoils then submits as the other policeman puts him in
handcuffs and leads him over to the police car Bobby Andes

ANDES

Andes turns and spits on Ray as he walks around him to sit
down Ray winces and tosses his head back in an attempt to
get the spit off of his face

RAY
You lied to me There ain’t no new
evidence Why don’t you take me in
if you got new evidence

ANDES

relaxed

Ray motions to Tony

house late at night he could get
shot by a burglar

Andes taunts Ray by holding the gun near his head Lou is
pulling at his handcuffs

Feeling uncomfortable boy

He goes over and presses his gun in Lou’s neck As he does
this he pulls Lou up by the shirt collar

ANDES (CONTD)

nervously

aside When Lou sees this he starts off too and both men head
for the door

Andes rushes into the room and grabs the gun from Tony as the
men rush out the door Andes follows

There is a shot Then two more Lou lies wounded on the path
and Andes stands with the gun in his hand as Ray escapes into
the desert

breathe erratically The sounds coming from deep within his
body are guttural and animal-like as he cries out His
sobbing becomes hysterical Out of control He is gasping for
air

dark unlit After a few minutes he stops the car and thinks
He turns off his lights and backs the car slowly down the
road and eases it into a small clearing

for a moment as he squeezes the handle of the gun He is
almost in a trance

TONY

RAY
So why don’t you just kill me Come

fingers slide around the handle

Ray looks Tony in the face He begins to grin

RAY

chest but is now moving towards Tony with the fire poker in
his hand He swings it towards Tony’s face as our screen goes

INT TRAILER WEST TEXAS DAY 87

Our sound returns as we hear flies buzzing close by Our
screen is black but begins to shift to a warm brown as murky
daylight starts to illuminate the image

Tony is lying on the floor of the trailer His head is
covered in blood that has began to crust over As a fly
crawls across his face he slowly reaches up in pain to fan it
away We see that there is a bloody gash across his face His
eyes are covered in dried blood and as he claws at them we
realize that he has been blinded Tony realizes this too

He feels around and finds the gun He holds onto it and finds
a chair and pulls himself up Light is now pouring into the
room He manages to get to his feet

As he begins to stumble around the room he walks into
something Someone It is Ray He is dead and lying in a pool
of blood

Tony bends down and runs his hands over Ray’s face and lifts
the deadweight of the arm He still holds the fire poker in
one hand

Tony finds his way out of the trailer As he does he falls to
the ground

EXT TRAILER WEST TEXAS DAY -- CONTINUOUS 88

He drags himself into the brush and towards the road He
struggles to reach into the air and fires the gun then drops
to the ground

He tries to lift the gun back up in the air in an attempt to
fire it once again As he rises to his knees he falls back to
the ground and onto the gun

A loud gunshot He has shot himself in the stomach He is
still alive but begins to loose consciousness

eyes are open She suddenly sits up and gasps for air

Our camera slides up Tony’s body to see him grasp at his neck
for the small gold cross

A breeze causes a loud brushing sound of the grass in the
wind as the sound of the insects rises

The sound of Tony’s heartbeat becomes louder and louder and
overtakes all other sound as our camera settles on his face

With each beat we cut back and forth from his face to that
of Susan’s as she begins to cry

The sounds of Tony’s cries of pain mingle with Susan’s cries

A soft smile comes over Susan’s face as she quickly types out
a response

INT MORROW RESIDENCE - SUSAN’S BATHROOM NEXT EVENING 93

Susan stands in front of her bathroom mirror She is dressed
to go out She raises her face slightly and looks at herself
intently She reaches for a tissue and wipes the lipstick off

stops for a moment and looks at her hand She slips the ring
back into the tray on her dressing table

beautiful and somehow younger

Susan follows the hostess to a table overlooking the
courtyard It is dusk and the lights of the city below are
beginning to glisten It is a beautiful LA night

HOSTESS
May I get you a drink while you
wait

She smiles at the hostess

SUSAN
Yes thank you Scotch on the
rocks

Susan is seated next to a young couple who are leaning in
closely to each other

Time passes Lingering shots of Susan Her hands as she feels
the finger where her wedding ring usually rests Her legs as
they cross and uncross Long shot of her sitting by herself
in a room full of people looking back towards the entry door
of the restaurant

She has finished her drink

HOSTESS
Mrs Morrow are you all right May
I get you another drink

SUSAN
Yes thank you

More time passes She finishes her second drink The couple
next to her has now left and the table is empty

Long shot of Susan sitting alone in the now almost deserted
room She sits still looking out over the lights of the city

Susan Morrow stares straight ahead and into the night The

expression on her face belies her realization that Edward is
not coming
