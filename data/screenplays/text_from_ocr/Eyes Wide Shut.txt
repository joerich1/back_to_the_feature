The band starts up again

The ballroom is crowded and BILL starts to make his way around
the dance floor to the bar

ALICE is at the bar waiting for him

She reaches absently for her champagne glass and finds
she is holding - or touching - a mans hand

ALICE
(smiles )
I think thats my glass
SZABO
Im absolutely certain of it

SZABO is a handsome man in his mid-forties with a slight
Central European accent

He drinks slowly from ALICES glass and looks directly into
her eyes as he does so

SZABO
Did you ever read the Latin poet
Ovid on The Art of Love

ALICE
Didnt he wind up all by himself
crying his eyes out in some place
with a very bad climate

SZABO
But he also had a good time first
A very good time By the way my
name is Sandor Szabo
Im Hungarian

ALICE
Pleased to meet you My name is
Alice Im American

SZABO

Would you like to dance Alice

ALICE notices BILL across the room talking to two beautiful
models

ALICE
Why not - Sandor

ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL and THE MODELS
GAYLE the taller model shouts to BILL above the music

GAYLE
Nobody likes you
(louder)
Nobody likes you is that the problem

BILL
Put it this way nobody wants to
admit how much they like me But
Im confident it can still happen

GAYLE
(laughs)
Do you know Nuala Windsor
GAYLE asks putting her arm around her friends waist

BILL
(smiles )
NualaI certainly feel like I do
How do you spell Nuala

NUALA
Nuala

BILL
Is that a Hawaiian name

NUALA
No its an agency name

They all laugh

ALICE is dancing with the Sandor He holds her close to

him

GAYLE
You were very kind to her once
BILL
Only once That sounds like an
oversight
NUALA

I was on a shoot modelling at
Rockefeller Center on a very windy
day You happened to be passing by

BILL
(remembering)
And you got something in your eye

NUALA
Just about half of 5th Avenue You
were such a gentleman

BILL
That can happen when youre ina
hurry

NUALA

You actually had a handkerchief -
which was also clean

BILL
Thats the kind of hero I can be
sometimes
SZABO
What do you do Alice

ALICE
Well actually Im looking for a
job at the moment I was an editor
at a publishing house but they went
broke

SZABO
Perhaps I can be of some help I
know a few people in publishing
Alice doesnt reply to this

SZABO
And youre married

ALICE shows him her wedding ring

SZABO
And youre here tonight with your
husband

ALICE

I am indeed

SZABO
How sad

Alice makes a thats-life face

SZABO
But of course I should have guessed
that If you werent with your
husband tonight you wouldnt be so
careful

ALICE laughs

SZABO
May I ask why a beautiful woman who
could have any man in this room wants
to be married

ALICE
You can ask

SZABO
You know why women used to get
married dont you

ALICE
Why dont you tell me
SZABO
It was the only way they could lose
their virginitys and be free to do
what they wanted with other men
The ones they really wanted

ALICE
Fascinating

SZABO
Victor and Illona have a fabulous
art collection

ALICE
They do dont they

SZABO

stuff upstairs

ALICE
I dont think so

SZABO
There are a couple of magnificent
Bonnards up there

ALICE

SZABO

ALICE
Yes I do
SZABO
Would you like me to show them to
you
ALICE

Well maybe not just right now

SZABO

ALICE smiles and shakes her head
BILL AND THE MODELS

NUALA slowly leading BILL to the door

NUALA
Do you know whats so nice about
doctors

BILL

Usually a lot less than people think

NUALA
They look so knowledgable

BILL
They are very knowledgeable - about
all sorts of things

GAYLE
But Ill bet they work too hard I
bet they miss out on a lot of fun

BILL
Youre absolutely right Where we

NUALA (laughs)
Where the rainbow ends BILL slows
down a little

GAYLE
Dont you want to go where the rainbow
ends

BILL
Do I want to go where the rainbow
ends

Before he can answer a big man who looks like he stepped
right out of The Godfather walks up - HARRIS Zieglers
personal assistant

HARRIS
Excuse me Doctor Harford May I
trouble you for a moment

BILL

HARRIS
(nods towards the
door )
Could you spare a minute please

ALICE AND SZABO DANCING

SZABO

ALICE makes a cant-help-that face

SZABO
Id really like to see you again

ALICE
I dont think that would really be a
good idea
SZABO
You are cruel What about lunch
later this week
BILL AND HARRIS - CORRIDORS AND STAIRCASE
Muffled sounds of the music echo from the ballroom below

HARRIS stops in front of a large door and knocks quietly

ZIEGLER (0S)
Yes

HARRIS
Its Harris sir

After a few seconds the key is turned in the lock and the
door slowly opens revealing a barefoot ZIEGLER wearing only
his pants and undershirt

ZIEGLER
Thanks very much for coming up Bill

He gestures BILL in HARRIS waits outside

A strikingly beautiful half-naked woman in her late twenties
is sprawled face up her clothing scattered on the floor

BILL
What happened

ZIEGLER
She ODd on coke

ZIEGLER gestures to the cocaine paraphernalia on the night
table

BILL
(checking her pulse)
How long has she been like this

ZIEGLER
Maybe ten minutes

BILL feels her carotid artery

BILL
Has this happened before

ZIEGLER
Not sure but probably

BILL turns her face to the light of a table lamp to check
her pupils The woman stirs

BILL
Shes starting to come around

The woman makes a few unintelligible sounds
BILL takes her wrist again and looks at his watch
BILL
GoodWellI dont think theres
really anything to worry about
Coke wears off in half an hour or
so
ZIEGLER is visibly relieved
BILL continues to watch her in silence
BILL
Someone should stay with her though

until shes fully herself again

ZIEGLER
Okay

BILL
Some cold towels on her face wouldnt
be a bad idea

ZIEGLER
Okay
BILL
Anyone here with her to take her
home
ZIEGLER
Ill take care of that Shes a

friend of the family

Bill nods and watches her for a few moments longer Then he
makes moves like he wants to go

BILL
Shell be all right Victor Okay
if I leave the rest to you

ZIEGLER
Sure And listen Bill I dont
know how to thank you enough for
this

BILL

It was nothing Glad to be of help
ZIEGLER

And Bill - I know I dont have to

say this but I trust this is just

between the two of us

BILL
Of course

BALLROOM

BILL re-enters the ballroom and looks around for the two
models but he doesnt see them

Then a womans arm slips through his
He looks down at the wedding-ringed hand
Its ALICE

She is flushed and glad to have found him

ALICE
Havent I seen you someplace before

BILL
Could be Whats your name again

She kisses him

ALICE
Can we go home now

BILL AND ALICES BEDROOM - NIGHT

ALICE stands naked in front of her dressing table mirror
rubbing face cream BILL comes up behind her kisses her
shoulder and runs his hands lightly over her breasts

VO
That night they were more blissful
in their ardent love than they had
been for a long time

SHOTS TO ILLUSTRATE VO

Getting up

Alice and Helena in the kitchen
Bill in his office with patients

VO
The gray of morning awakened them
only too soon Alice had to take
Helena to school And Bill hada
number of early appointments So
the evening hours passed in the
predetermined daily routine of work
and the events of the night before
began to fade

BILLS APARTMENT - HELENAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

HELENA reading aloud to BILL and ALICE from A Childs Garden
of Verses She finishes her poem and yawns

BILL
And now my darling time for bed
What do you say
HELENA smiles and puts her arms around BILL

BILL and ALICE kiss her goodnight turn out the lights and
go into the living room

LIVING ROOM

ALICE sighs comfortably

ALICE
So how do you feel about wrapping
some presents
BILL
Kind of negative We can do it
tomorrow

Bill drops down on the couch picks up the TV controller and
starts switching channels

Alice snuggles up to him

ALICE
Anything good on tonight

BILL
Have you got the paper

Alice puts her arms around him

ALICE
I dont feel like watching TV

They kiss

ALICE
Lets break the law a little first

BATHROOM - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Bill takes a Band-Aid box from the bathroom medicine cabinet
and removes a small plastic bag of pot

BEDROOM
Alice skillfully rolls two joints
MINUTES LATER

Bill and Alice sitting in bed partly undressed and smoking
the joints

Alice inhales and leans back with an ashtray in her lap
She is high

ALICE
How about the truth game

BILL
Always a bit dangerous with pot
ALICE
Isnt that the fun

BILL
Im putty in your hands

ALICE
Okay lets start with who were those
those two gorgeous women at the party
last night

BILL
Dont really know One of them just
started talking to me

ALICE
I thought they might be patients

BILL
No such luck Theyre models One
of them said I once removed something
from her eyes on windy day in
Rockefeller Plaza

ALICE
Always on the job

BILL
Thats me

ALICE
And what did they want from you this
time

BILL

My body - what else

ALICE doesnt find the remark particularly amusing

BILL
Hey come on - all I did was talk to
them Anyway who was the guy you

were dancing with

BILL is not that interested and just wants to change the
subject

ALICE
Sandor

BILL
Sandor Who is he

ALICE
A friend of the Zieglers

BILL
And what does he do

ALICE

I never actually found out
BILL

Rich
ALICE

Talked like he was

BILL
And what did he want

ALICE
Sex Upstairs Then and there

The pot makes ALICE think this is hilarious

BILL
Well I guess thats understandable

ALICE
Understandable

BILL
Well youre a beautiful woman

ALICE
Oh I see So does exhaustive
research show that every man I meet
wants to screw me

BILL
There might be some exceptions

ALICE
Does that mean that all men with
possibly some exceptions want to
screw all beautiful women married
or otherwise

BILL
I suppose basically yes

ALICE
So does that mean you wanted to screw
the two models

BILL
I did say with some exceptions

ALICE
And of course youre an exception

BILL
Yes

ALICE
How come

BILL

Because I love you

ALICE
Any other reasons

BILL
Because were married
ALICE
Any others
BILL
And because I wouldnt lie to you or
hurt you
ALICE

So basically what it comes down to
is that you wouldnt screw the two
models out of considerationfor me
but otherwise you would

BILL
Hey is this thing on Court TV

BILL feigns looking around for cameras

ALICE
Why dont you just give me a straight
answer

BILL

Hey come on honey The pots making
you aggressive

He takes her cigarette and puts it out
ALICE

Im not being aggressive at all and
how about you not putting out my --
BILL
Okay Okay Okay

ALICE
Now try to be honest When some
really great-looking woman comes in
to your office to have her tits
checked out dont you ever think
about screwing her

BILL
Come on give me a break Ima
doctor Its all very impersonal

And anyway my insurance requires
that a nurse is always present

ALICE
Youre being evasive When youre
feeling her tits is it never any
more than sheer professionalism

BILL
Basically thats all it is

ALICE
Just basically

BILL
Oh come on There are no absolutes
in anything

ALICE
No absolutes Okay Fine And
does the same thing go for women
While theyre having their tits
squeezed do you suppose your lady
patients ever wonder what your dick
might be like

BILL
Definitely not

ALICE
And why is that

BILL
Because theyre too worried about
what I might find

ALICE
You know what I mean

BILL
No again Not most of them

ALICE
Why

BILL
Well I suppose that most women are
programmed differently from men

ALICE
Oh yes I forgot Millions of years
of evolution - right Men have to
put their sperm into as many women
as they can but women stay at home
with pretty pink things and take
care of the children

BILL
A bit oversimplified but something
like that

A dispirited smile passes over her face

ALICE
Oh if you men only knew

The look in her eyes changes becoming cool and impenetrable
and BILL allows her hands to slip from his

BILL
If we knew - What do you mean by
that
ALICE
(in a strangely harsh
voice)

About what you imagine my dear

BILL
Hey Alice hey look at me The
truth Is there something youve
kept from me

ALICE looks down with a strange smile

BILL
Youre just trying to wind me up

ALICE
If you say so

BILL
If I say so Wait a minute Im
not going to let you get away with
that Seriously Is theres
something you havent told me

ALICE stops short of saying something

BILL
Say it

ALICE nods

ALICE
Well last summer at Cape Cod - I
dont suppose you remember one night
in the dining room there was a young
Naval officer sitting near us He
was with two other officers

BILL
As a matter of fact I dont But
what about him

ALICE
The waiter brought him a message
during dinner at which point he
left the table

Bill waits for her to continue

ALICE
Well I first saw him that morning
in the lobby He was checking in
and he was following the bellboy
with his luggage to the elevator
He glanced at me as he walked past
but didnt stop until he had gone a
few more steps Then he turned and
looked at me He didnt say anything
He didnt smile In fact it seemed
to me that he scowled Maybe I did
the same thing

ALICE stops for a moment
ALICE
I was very stirred by him That
whole day I lay on the beach lost
in dreams

She stops

BILL
Go on

ALICE thinks about how to continue

BILL stares at her
ALICE
That afternoon you and I made love
and talked about our future and our
child Later we were sitting on the
balcony and he passed below us without
looking up Just the sight of him
stirred me deeply and I thought if
he wanted me I could not have
resisted I thought I was ready to
give up you the child my whole
future And yet at the same time -
if you can understand it - you were
dearer to me than ever and I stroked
your forehead and kissed your hair
and at that moment my love for you
was both tender and sad At dinner
I wore a white rose and you said I
was very beautiful It might not
have been just an accident that he
and his friends sat near us He
didnt look up but I actually
considered getting up walking over
to him and like someone in a movie
saying Here I am my love for
whom I have waited - take me Well
it was about then that the waiter
brought him the envelope He read
it turned pale said goodbye to his
friends - and glancing at me
mysteriously he left the room

ALICE stops for a moment

ALICE
I barely slept that night and woke
up the next morning very agitated
I didnt know whether I was afraid
that he had left or that he might
still be there But by dinner I
realized he was gone and I breathed
a sigh of relief

Long silence

BILL
And if he hadnt left

Alice doesnt reply

ALICE
I dont know

BILL doesnt say anything but there is a scornful
around his mouth

expression
The phone rings

BILL
HelloOh When did they call
No I have the addressIf they
call again say Im on my way

He hangs up the phone and starts to put on his shoes

BILL
Lou Nathanson just died

ALICE
Oh thats too bade But you were
expecting that werent you

BILL
Yes

Bill starts to get dressed

BILL

I have to go over there for a while
ALICE

Now
BILL

I have to show my face

BILL silently getting dressed

ALICE
Obviously it was a mistake to have
told you
BILL
(coldly)
Not at all We must always tell

each other everything

ALICE
It was the pot

BILL
It doesnt really matter Nothing
happened Just a passing fancy

EXT MARIONS APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT

BILLs taxi pulls up to the stylish lower 5th avenue
apartment

Doorman opens the door

INT MARIONS LOBBY
Bill walks to the elevator
INT MARIONS PRIVATE ELEVATOR - LOBBY
Bill exits elevator and finds her door ajar
He knocks softly and enters without waiting for a reply

BILL

(softly)
Marion

He walks through the quiet apartment
MASTER BEDROOM
The body of LOU NATHANSON lies on a large bed with an oxygen
cylinder and other medical paraphernalia on tables on each
side of the bed
MARION the dead mans daughter a pretty girl in her late
twenties sits at the foot of the bed exhausted her arms
hanging limply at her side
She starts to get up but BILL stops her with a movement from
his hand and she merely greets him with a nod her eyes

large and sad

BILL moves to the head of the bed and mechanically places
his hands on the forehead of the dead man and on his arms

He shakes his head a couple of times and his shoulders drop
with a slight expression of regret

BILL
I hope his last moments were peaceful

Marion gives him a despairing look

He puts his hands in his pockets and his eyes wander about
the room until they finally rest again on Marion

BILL
Well Marion at least you werent
entirely unprepared for this
She holds out her hand to him He takes it sympathetically

Marion sighs woefully

MARION
Dad seemed pretty good today
MARION
Around nine oclock he said he felt
like taking a nap So I went into
the living room to watch television
I dont think I was out of his room
for more than half-an-hour

Marion starts to weep

MARION
When I went back at first I though
he was still asleep Then I
realized he wasnt breathing I
did everything you had told me but
he was

She cant bring herself to say dead and she shakes her
head despairingly

MARION
I called the emergency people But
when they got here they just said he
wasdead and asked whether I wanted
them to take him away

She breaks down sobbing
BILL draws up a chair and sits down opposite her
BILL
Marion from what youve said it

sounds like your father died in his
sleep He wouldnt have suffered

MARION
Oh GodI hope not Ive been so
afraid of the actual dying
business But he made it so easy

just as he tried to make everything
else in my life easy

BILL takes her hands

BILL
Have you notified any of your
relatives

MARION

I phoned Carl - my fiancee

She does not look BILL straight in the eye when she says
fiancee

MARION
Hes going to make some calls for me
and then hes coming over

BILL
Oh thats good

MARION
I think youve met Carl here a few
times Were planning to get married

in April

BILL
Oh thats wonderful Im very happy
for you

They sit for a few moments without speaking

VO
I certainly do remember Carl So
shes going to marry him Bill thought
to himself I wonder why She surely
cant be in love with him Hes
nothing to look at and he hasnt
got any money Hes just an
assistant in professor of something
or other But then its none of
my business Still if she were
my mistress her hair would be less
dry and her lips would be fuller and
redder

Marion suddenly starts to talk

MARION
Dad had so many worries and
disappointments My mother was never
well And my brotherhe was
such a disappointment I dont
even know where he is The last we
heard from him was from some small
town in Mexico I cant even remember
where

In spite of himself BILL places his hand on her head
caressing it He feels her body begin to tremble and her
sobs become louder and finally quite unrestrained All at
once she slips down from her chair and kneels in front of
him clasping his legs with her arms and pressing her face
into them

She looks up at him with large eyes wild with grief and
whispers ardently

MARION
I dont want to leave here Even
if you never return Even if I am
never to see you again I want

at least to live near you
BILL looks touched rather than surprised

BILL
Please - get up Marion

He says this softly and bending down he gently raises her
up

He glances at the dead man on the bed and only puts his arms
around her in a very hesitant embrace and kisses her on the
forehead

At the same time without knowing why a sense of anger wells
up against ALICE

Jealous fantasy image of Alice and the Naval officer The
door bell rings

He hastily kisses Marions cheek as if in gratitude and
goes to the door

Its CARL standing there - a very ordinary looking man with
an umbrella in his hand and a serious face appropriate to
the situation

The two men greet each other much more cordially than is
called for by their actual state of acquaintance

They walk to the bedroom and CARL has an embarrassed look at
the deceased

CARL
Oh my poor dear Marion I am so
sorry

He puts his arms around her

BILL goes into the next room to write out the death
certificate

When he finishes he returns to the bedroom where the engaged
couple sit hand in hand by the bed of the dead man

The door-bell rings

CARL
Ill get it

While he is out of the room Marion with her eyes on the
floor says almost inaudibly

MARION
I love you

BILL merely pronounces her name tenderly

BILL
Marion

CARL returns with Marions UNCLE and AUNT and aunt whose
presence gives BILL the opportunity to make his goodbyes and
leave

At the door

CARL
I hope well see you soon

EXT MARIONS APARTMENT - NIGHT
Bill walks outside It has become even milder A gentle

breeze carries from the nearby park to the street BILL
inhales the fresh air

DOORMAN
Taxi

BILL
No thanks I think Ill walk for a
bit

EXT STREET TO PARK - NIGHT
Bill walking
EXT PARK -— NIGHT

Walking through the park BILL notices on some of the benches
in the shadows that couples are kissing just as if Spring
had actually arrived and no danger lurked in the deceptive
warm air

A tramp lies full length on a bench wrapped in newspapers
with his hat over his face

VO
The image of the tramp made him think
of the dead man he had just left
and he shuddered and felt slightly
nauseated at the thought that decay
and decomposition had already begun
their work in the body he just left
vVO
He was glad he was still alive and
in all probability that these ugly
things were still far removed from
him and that he was in fact still
in the prime of life had a beautiful
wife and could have several women in
addition if he wanted to although
doing so would require more free
time than he had

BILL notices a group of rowdy college boys coming towards

him six of them taking up the whole walkway

He moves aside to keep out of their way

But as they pass one of them a tall boy with an open
overcoat deliberately bumps into him with his raised elbow

BILL involuntarily stops

The tall student takes two more steps and turns

They glare at each other for a moment with only a short

distance separating them
Suddenly BILL turns around again and walks

He hears a short laugh behind him

He wants to turn around and fight but he feels his heart

beating strangely

vVO
Had he become a coward he asked
himself and noticed his knees were
shaking a little bit Ridiculous
Why should he get involved in a street
fight with some drunken college
student who had five friends with
him

BILL keeps walking without looking back

VO
He a man of thirty-five a practicing
physician a married man and father
of a child He might wind up in the
hospital or worse and tomorrow be in
the same position as the man he just
left Then he thought about his
profession

There were dangers lurking there

INT DOMINO APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT

She leads BILL through the small dingy entrance lobby lit

by a flickering fluorescent tube to a ground-floor rear

apartment

BILL
Should we talk about the money
DOMINO
How does sixty sound BILL nods a
little uncomfortably

BILL
Sixty Sounds good

DOMINO laughs
DOMINO
(laughs )
I dont keep track of the time
She unlocks the door and they go inside
Its a clean reasonably tidy ex cold-water railway flat
The girl smiles sweetly and walks ahead of BILL into the

narrow bedroom where there is a neatly made king-size bed
without a bedspread

Nice little place

DOMINO

She stands naked before him with her arms outstretched

DOMINO
How old do you think

She puts her arms around his neck again and gazes into his
eyes

DOMINO

BILL thinks for a moment and nods Then he sighs and gets
to his feet

DOMINO

He gets out his wallet and starts to count out sixty dollars

DOMINO
Oh look you dont have to

sociologists
They both laugh
DOMINO

Okay but youve got a raincheck

BILL

EXT STREET TO CAFE SONATA - NIGHT
BILL walks aimlessly through the wintry night

VO
Where shall I go now he asked
himself The obvious thing was home
to bed But he couldnt persuade
himself to do that He thought of
going back to the girl but that
somehow seemed ridiculous now He
was overcome with a sense that he
was moving farther and farther away
from his everyday existence into a
completely different world

By the chance he passes a small nightclub Cafe Sonata and
notices Nick Nightingales name and photograph outside

He stops and looks at it
The DOORMAN drifts over
DOORMAN
The bands about to wind up but
theyre still serving
BILL nods and goes in

INT CAFE SONATA - NIGHT

The place is about a quarter full BILL sits down at a table
near the band

Nick sees him and winks

BILL gestures hello orders a beer

The band finishes their last number and take a perfunctory

bow to a scattering of applause
NICK comes over to the table

NICK
Hey Bill

They shake hands and ad-libs of greetings
The WAITER swoops in with BILLs beer

BILL
What are you drinking

NICK
Scotch and soda

The WAITER nods and hurries off

NICK
So what brings you out at this hour

BILL
Just happened to be passing by I
have a patient in the neighbourhood

NICK
Do you live in the Village

BILL
No weve got an apartment on Central
Park West

NICK

Youre married

BILL
Nine years

NICK
That was the great looking woman you
were dancing with at the party

BILL
Yes
NICK
Lucky man
BILL nods
NICK

NICK

Seattle

BILL

NICK

BILL

NICK
(shrugs)
They only get started there about

BILL
In the village

NICK
I dont actually know the address

BILL
How come

NICK
Its in a different place every time
and I only get it about an hour or
so beforehand

BILL

A different place every time
NICK

So far
BILL

Whats the big mystery Nick opens
his palms in a parody of innocence

NICK
I just play the piano

BILL
What kind of a function is it

NICK
What kind of a function is it

Well to be completely honest its

not easy to describe

BILL

But youve worked there before
NICK

True
BILL

And its not easy to describe
NICK

I play blindfolded
BILL

What
NICK

I play blindfolded

Something near the entrance door attracts Nicks attention

NICK
(stands up)
Back in a minute

He walks to the front window of the club and looks out into

the snowy street

returns

NICK
Sorry about that Im supposed to
meet somebody here

BILL
With the address

Nick shrugs meaning yes

BILL
Listen youre putting me on about
that blindfolded business arent
you

He doesnt see what hes looking for and

NICK
No thats the truth Theyre very
strict about that

BILL
This is getting curiouser and
curiouser

NICK
Maybe so but listen I was sworn to
secrecy and please just forget I
said anything at all about it

BILL
Nick you can trust me I wont say
a word about this to anyone but since
youve told me this much you cant
stop now

NICK
No really this is not a joke Im
not saying anything else

BILL
Nick you cant do this to me Ill
wonder about this for the rest of my
life Trust me

NICK is very uncomfortable about this but is also dying to
talk about it

NICK
Okay well this is just between us

BILL
Absolutely

NICK
Wellfirst of all although I am
blindfolded I can of course still
hear and the sounds

NICK closes his eyes and lets the provocative innuendo sink
in

NICK
Andthe last time the blindfold
wasnt tied on that well

NICK also lets that sink in
NICK
BillIve seen a few things in my
life but never anything like this
And I have never seen such women

BILL
What does it cost to get into this
place

NICK
Forget it
BILL
What do you mean forget it
NICK
Forget it
BILL

Look I dont care what it costs

NICK
Its not a matter of money These
people arent interested in money
Its a completely closed affair

BILL
These people Who are these people

NICK
Put it this way - if I knew their
names it would be worth more than my
life to say them out loud

BILL
Nick dont you think you might just
be over-dramatizing this a little
bit There must be some way you can
get me in

NICK
(shakes his head)
It would be too dangerous

BILL
Dangerous

NICK
These are not people you fuck with -
if youll pardon the pun

Nick sees someone looking through the plate glass

window

NICK
Ill be right back

He gets up and hurries outside to the street

BILL watches him through the window hunched up against the
cold stamping his feet up and down talking to a man and
writing something down

Nick returns blowing on his hands
Bill gives him and inquiring look

BILL
Was that the address

NICK
And the password

BILL
Password

NICK
Yes You cant get in without the
password and they change it every
time And listen Im going to
have to get weaving pretty soon

BILL
(said with a smile)
Nick you son-of-a-bitch you know
you are definitely going to have to
take me with you tonight You know
that dont you

Nick sighs and shakes his head

BILL
Look Ill tell you what - you give
me the password and the address and
Ill go there by myself There wont
be the slightest connection with
you whatsoever

NICK squirms

NICK
Look even if I were crazy enough to
do that you couldnt get in the way
youre dressed anyway

BILL
Why not
NICK
Everyone there is always masked and
in costume

BILL
Masked and in costume

NICK
Always

Bill looks at his watch

BILL
Okay Point taken But theres a
possibility I know a place that might
still be open

NICK
Bill youre out of your mind No
costume place would be open at this
time of night

BILL
Look Nick what the hell Just
give me a chance Let me try If I
cant get the gear Ill forget about
the whole thing Scouts honour
NICK looks ready to give in

BILL
Okay

NICK sighs in resignation
BILL
Okay So let me have the address
and the password and tell me what
kind of costume I need

EXT BUSY GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT

BILLs taxi pulls up in front of a costume shop A sign
says Formal Dress and Costumes

The place is closed

BILL
Shit

He thinks for a moment pays the driver and gets out

He notices a sign that says In case of emergency ring
apartment 3

He looks up and sees a light on in the apartment above the
store

He rings the bell for apartment 3 which has the name
Gibson

After a couple of rings a voice comes over the intercom

GIBSON
Yes what is it

BILL talks to the TV security camera

BILL
Mister Gibson

GIBSON
What do you want

BILL
Mister Gibson Im very sorry to
disturb you at this hour Ima
Doctor My name is Harford I need
to see you Its important

Bill holds up his New York State Medical Board card to the
doorway TV security camera

GIBSON
Somebody hurt

BILL
No ones hurt but its important

GIBSON
What kind of important

BILL
It would really be better if I could
come upstairs for a moment and talk
to you

GIBSON
You better come back tomorrow

BILL
Mr Gibson tomorrow will be too
late I really need to see you now
It wont take long
Silence

Then the door buzzer sounds

BILL pushes open the door and goes upstairs two at a time

A door opens on the chain and a man in his fifties wearing
flannel pyjamas and a heavy bathrobe who has the looks and
manner of a road-company ham actor peers out

BILL
Mr Gibson

GIBSON
Yes

BILL holds up his New York State medical card again

BILL
Good evening Mister Gibson This
is my New York State Medical Board
card just so you know who I am

Gibson looks at the card and at BILL

GIBSON
Okay so youre Doctor Harford
Whats this all about

BILL
Mister Gibson you may not find it
that easy to understand the urgency
of this but basically uhm I
needa costume and a tux

Gibson stares at him in disbelief

GIBSON

You need a costume and a tux
BILL

Yes
GIBSON

Im sorry but do you honestly expect
me to open my shop for you at this
hour

BILL
I can imagine how this may seem to
you Mister Gibson and I am prepared
to pay an extra two hundred dollars
for the inconvenience

Gibson doesnt reply

BILL
How does that sound to you

Judging from his expression this sounds pretty good to Mr
Gibson

INT COSTUME SHOP - NIGHT

A short while later Gibson leads BILL through the shop to
the dimly lit costume section

GIBSON
Okay now let me get this straight
You want a tuxedo a black monks
cassock and a mask that completely
covers your face

BILL
Thats it

GIBSON
I have to tell you doctor Ive had
some very strange requests in my day
and this is certainly one of them

BILL
Its for a good cause

GIBSON
Okay youre the doctor

GIBSON chuckles at his own witticism
GIBSON
Now let me get this straight You
want a tuxedo a monks cassock and a
mask that completely covers your
face

BILL
Thats it

Suddenly BILL hears the clink of glasses from somewhere ahead
of him

GIBSON flips a light switch

A light come on in a little office at the end of the passage
The desk is covered with plates glasses and bottles

Two JAPANESE MEN wearing blonde female wigs naked except
for Japanese kimonos spring up from their chairs besides

the desk

At the same moment the semi-naked figure of a graceful GIRL
disappears under the desk

GIBSON rushes forward with long strides reaches across the
desk and grabs one of the blond wigs

Simultaneously the young GIRL maybe fourteen wriggles out
from under the desk and runs along the passage to BILL who
catches her in his arms

GIBSON drops the wig and grabs the two kimono garbed men
At the same time he calls out to BILL

GIBSON
Hold on to that girl for me please

The GIRL presses against BILL as if now sure of her
protection Her pretty little face covered with powder and
a smile of impish desire in her eyes

GIBSON
(shouts )
Gentlemen you will stay here while
I call the police

KIMONO 1
Gibson have you gone mad

KIMONO 2
We were invited by the young lady

GIBSON
You will have to explain this
Couldnt you see the girl is
unbalanced

Then GIBSON he turns to BILL

GIBSON
Sorry to keep you waiting

BILL
Thats okay

BILL looks down with fascination at the GIRL who looks up
at him with alluring and childlike eyes as if spellbound

The two KIMONO MEN start to argue with each other in
Japanese

GIBSON turns to BILL
GIBSON

Im sorry did you say a brown or
black cassock

BILL
Black

YOUNG GIRL
(with gleaming eyes)
No You must give this gentleman a
cloak lined with ermine and a doublet
of red silk

GIBSON
(to girl)
Dont you budge from there
(to Bill)
What size are you

BILL
I take a 38 jacket

GIBSON picks up a brown monks cassock hanging nearby and
holds it up for BILLS approval

GIBSON
This will fit you

BILL
Fine

GIBSON

Okay lets go and try on the tux

The two Japanese men are still in the glass partitioned
office

GIBSON locks them in

KIMONO 1
Gibson this is preposterous You
will have to let us out at once

GIBSON
Im afraid thats out of the question
gentlemen This is now a police
matter You will kindly wait here
until I return

Ad-libs of further protest from the two men The girl skips
lightly up the stairs ahead of them

GIBSON
Now go to bed at once you depraved
creature Ill talk to you as soon

as Ive settled with those two

The girl gives BILL a sad shake of her head and exits

INT FRONT OF COSTUME SHOP - A LITTLE LATER

Bill has changed into a black tuxedo and waits for Gibson to
write up the bill His clothes and the costume are in two
large plastic shopping bags

GIBSON
Okay - thats a hundred and fifty
for the rental Three hundred
deposit And the two hundred
inconvenience money Thats six
hundred and fifty bucks

BILL
Okay

BILL hands him his credit card and his drivers license

GIBSON
Id prefer cash

BILL
Sorry I dont carry that kind of
money

Gibson takes the credit card

BILL
Thanks And - by the way - I hope
you wont be too hard on the child

GIBSON
Im sorry doctor but Im not sure
what business it is of yours

BILL
Well its just that I first heard
you say the girl was unbalanced and
then you called her depraved Those
things are a little contradictory

GIBSON
(a bit theatrically)
Well arent insanity and depravity
the same in the eyes of God

The last thing BILL wants right now is to get into an argument
with GIBSON so he replies in his most professional manner

BILL
Well in any event there are things
that can be done that might help the
situation Maybe we can have another
talk about it tomorrow

Gibson laughs mockingly without uttering a sound
EXT STREET OUTSIDE COSTUME SHOP - NIGHT

Bill carrying two plastic shopping bags with his clothes in
them hails a taxi

He checks at a slip of paper with the address on it
BILL
How do you feel about going out to
Sands Point Long Island

The driver makes a face

BILL
How about twenty bucks over the meter

CAB DRIVER
(shakes his head)
Ill have to come back empty

BILL
Hows fifty

CAB DRIVER
Fiftys good

Bills Thoughts Variations of I

EXT LONG ISLAND MANSION ROAD - NIGHT
The cab drives slowly down a wooded road
INT CAB
BILL looking out for the house
Up ahead he sees a stretch-limo with darkened windows pulling
into a drive protected by iron gates flanked by two

gatehouses

As they drive slowly past the gates BILL sees a sign that
says Bletchly Manor’

BILL
Okay driver - thats the place
Stop a little way down the road

The car comes to a stop
The meter says 7550 BILL takes out his wallet

BILL
Okay heres eighty dollars and

BILL carefully tears a hundred-dollar bill in half and gives
one part to the driver

BILL
---I promised you fifty bucks over
the meter but Ill make it a hundred
if you wait for me Let the meter
run and youll get the other half
plus the meter when I come back
Okay

The driver gives BILL a wary look

CAB DRIVER
How long will you be

BILL
Thats the thing - Im not sure I
could be ten minutes I could be an

hour or so But look Im leaving
all my stuff in the back Okay

The cab driver takes half of the torn hundred-dollar bill

CAB DRIVER
Okay

BILL gets out of the cab puts on the monks cassock throws
his coat over his shoulders and walks back to the gates

EXT GATES - NIGHT
The iron gates are closed and no one is in sight
Security cameras look at him

The road leading to the Manor House curves away into a small
wood which covers the house

BILL rings a bell at the side of the gate and two men promptly
come out of the gate house
GATEMAN 1
(polite and well-spoken)
Good morning sir

BILL
Good morning

GATEMAN 1
Can we be of any help you

BILL
I suppose youd like the password

GATEMAN 1
If you wouldnt mind sir

BILL
(slowly)
Fidelio Rainbow

GATEMAN 1
Thank you sir

The gate is opened

GATEMAN 1
Is that your taxi down there sir

BILL
Uh - yes Yes - my chauffeur came
down with the flu at the last minute

GATEMAN 1
The cabby could have driven you right
to the door

BILL
Listen Im lucky I got here at all
The guys straight from Bulgaria

Bill laughs uncomfortably without getting a pennys change
from the men

GATEMAN 1
(pointing a car)
If youd like to get in the car
sir Well run you up to the house

BILL
Okay Thanks

They get into the car

Gateman 2 remains at the gate

INT CAR
Bill sits silently next to the driver
POV - THE LONG ISLAND - MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
INT CAR
GATEMAN 1
(tactfully)
This might be a good time to put on
your mask sir
BILL
(casually)
Oh yes Of course
BILL takes the mask from his pocket and puts it on
EXT MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT
The car pulls up and BILL gets out

BILL
Thanks

He walks up the stone steps and the front doors are opened
before he reaches them

INT HOUSE

BILL enters a large candlelit mirrored vestibule where two
servants in black suits their faces covered by grey masks
whisper in unison

SERVANTS
Password

BILL
Fidelio Rainbow

SERVANT 1
Thank you sir One of them takes
his coat while the other opens a
door

BILL enters a long room dimly lit with candles with high
ceilings and walls covered with black silk

A line of mirrored doors on each side run the length of the
room

There are about fifty men and women dressed as monks and
nuns their faces completely covered by masks

Gently swelling strains of Italian liturgical music comes
from an organ playing somewhere

As his eyes become accustomed to the dim light BILL sees
that the women are naked beneath the full-length black veils
that flow down from their head bands

His eyes wander from voluptuous bodies to slender bodies
from delicate to richly developed figures and he is filled
with inexpressible desire

Occasionally eyes turn towards him but immediately look
away as soon as he notices them

A monk brushes against him and nods a greeting but from
behind the mask BILL sense a searching and penetrating glance

A strange heavy perfume as of southern gardens pervades
the room

Again an arm brushes against him but this time it is that
of a nun

Her face is fully masked and like the others naked under
the black transparent lace of her veil

THE WOMAN
You dont belong here Theres still
a chance for you to get away

BILL is momentarily unnerved by this but he is also completely
captivated by the beauty and sensuality of this woman

BILL
Im terribly sorry but I think youve
mistaken me for someone else

THE WOMAN
Please dont be foolish about this
You must leave at once

BILL
Who are you

THE WOMAN
It doesnt matter You must go

BILL
Will you come with me

THE WOMAN
Thats impossible

BILL
Impossible

THE WOMAN
Impossible

BILL
Is there someplace else here we could
go

THE WOMAN
Absolutely not Please believe me
if you are discovered it will go
hard with you

BILL moves closer to her but she steps back

ANOTHER WOMAN
Whats the matter Why dont you
dance

BILL sees two men watching him from another corner and
suspects that this woman has been sent to put him to the
test

He smiles

BILL
I would love to dance

But just at that moment THE WOMAN returns

She pretends that she has just noticed him and says ina
voice that can be heard by the two men

THE WOMAN
Returned at last
(she laughs)
All your efforts are useless I
know you

Then turning to the other woman she whispers

THE WOMAN
Let me have him first - just for a
while

The other woman smiles agreement and with a light step goes
to join the two men who have been watching

THE WOMAN
Dont ask any questions and dont
be surprised at anything

THE WOMAN
I have tried to lead them astray but
you cant fool them for much longer
Go before it is too late - and be
careful that no one follows you No
one must know who you are There
would be no more peace for you Go

BILL
Is there any way --

THE WOMAN
There is no way

He takes her hand and draws her closer to him

BILL
I must see you again

She whispers despairingly

THE WOMAN
Go

BILL
Is there no way I can ever see you
again

THE WOMAN

No We must never meet again It
could cost your life and mine

Just at that moment a tall man stops before them and with
a slight bow courteous but imperative says

TALL MAN
Will you dance with me

THE WOMAN hesitates but the TALL MAN puts his arm around her
waist and leads her away the adjoining room

A moment later a voice whispers behind BILL

ELEGANT MAN
Password

BILL turns around and sees two men
One heavy-set the other slim and elegant

ELEGANT MAN
Password

BILL
Fidelio Rainbow

ELEGANT MAN
Thats right sir Thats the
password for admittance but may I
ask what is the password for the
house

BILL is stuck He takes a deep breath

ELEGANT MAN
Wont you be kind enough to tell me
the password of the house

This time it sounds like a threat

BILL cant think of anything to say He shakes his head and
shrugs

BILL
Sorry It looks like I must have
forgotten it

The elegant man walks to the middle of the room and raises
his hand

Everything gradually comes to a stop

Blindfolded Nick stops playing when someone places a hand
on his shoulder and whispers something to him

With all eyes on him the two men walk back to BILL

ELEGANT MAN
The password sir I must demand
that you give it

BILL
Look Im terribly sorry but Ive
told you I must have forgotten it

ELEGANT MAN
Thats unfortunate For here it
doesnt matter whether you have
forgotten it or if you never knew
it

The rest of the men slowly gather around BILL
BILL

Well gentlemen I seem to owe you
all an apology

ELEGANT MAN
It is too late for apologies

BILL
Well be that as it may you have my
most sincere regrets for not
remembering the second password

ELEGANT MAN
Im afraid this is not a question of
regret but of expiation

BILL
Well gentlemen you must excuse me
now I am leaving

ELEGANT MAN
Im afraid that is no longer possible

BILL
Gentlemen dont you think this farce
has gone far enough

BILL looks for a way out but no one makes way for him

ELEGANT MAN
You will kindly remove your mask

BILL looks around at the masked faces surrounding him
ELEGANT MAN
(sharply)
Please remove your mask

BILL slowly removes his mask and puts it in his pocket

THE WOMAN
I am ready to redeem him

There is a murmur of surprise in the room THE WOMAN reaches
for the veil which is wrapped around her head face and
neck and unwinds it with a wonderful circular movement

It sinks to the floor leaving her naked her dark hair
falling in great profusion over her shoulders breasts and
hips

ELEGANT MAN
You are ready to redeem him

THE WOMAN
Yes I am

There is a low gasp from the assemblage
ELEGANT MAN
You know what youre taking upon
yourself in doing this

THE WOMAN
Yes

Another murmur from the room
The elegant man turns back to BILL

ELEGANT MAN
You are free Leave this house at
once But first I must warn you
that if you make any further inquiries
or inform anyone about what you have
seen here tonight there will be the
most serious consequences for yourself
and your family Do you understand
that

BILL doesnt reply immediately

BILL
How is this woman to redeem me

ELEGANT MAN
That has nothing to do with you

BILL shakes his head

BILL
I cant let this woman pay for me

ELEGANT MAN
You would be unable in any case to
change her fate When a promise has
been made here there is no turning
back

THE WOMAN
Go You cannot save me

As she says this she tears off the mask allowing BILL
momentary glimpse of her face

Then he is seized by irresistible arms and pushed out
INT BILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT
It is four oclock in the morning

BILL now changed back into his own clothes enters his
apartment

Everyone is asleep

He goes into his study and locks the costume and tux ina
closet

In order not to wake ALICE he undresses before going into
the bedroom

BEDROOM

ALICE is asleep lying with her arms folded under her head
Her lips are half open and painful shadows surround them

It is a face BILL does not know
He bends down over her and at once her forehead becomes
lined with furrows as though someone had touched it and

her features seem strangely distorted

Suddenly still in her sleep she laughs so shrilly that he
becomes alarmed

BILL
(invonluntarily)
Alice

She laughs again as if in answer in a strange almost
uncanny manner

BILL
Alice

She opens her eyes slowly and with difficulty
She stares at him as though she does not recognize him

BILL
Alice

As she wakes up an expression of fear even of terror comes
into her eyes

Half awake and seemingly in despair she raises her arms

BILL
Whats the matter

ALICE stares at him still frightened

BILL
Alice its me

ALICE breathes deeply tries to smile drops her arms on the
blanket

ALICE
(in a far away voice)
Is it morning yet

BILL
It will be very soon Its a little
past four oclock Ive just come
home

She nods but barely seems to have heard or understood him
She stares into space as though she can see through him
He bends over and touches her forehead

She shudders slightly

BILL
Whats the matter

She shakes her head slowly and he passes his hand gently
over her hair

BILL
Alice you laughed so strangely
Whats the matter

ALICE
(distantly)
Ive been dreaming

BILL
(gently)
What have you been dreaming

ALICE
Oh so much I cant quite remember

BILL
Perhaps if you try

ALICE
It was all so confused - and Im
tired You must be tired too

BILL
Not really I dont think Ill go
to bed at all You know sometimes
when I come home so late its better
to just go straight to work

ALICE nods without interest

BILL
But why dont you tell me about your
dream

He smiles a little artificially

ALICE
You really ought to lie down and
take a little rest

BILL hesitates a moment then he stretches himself beside
her though he is careful not to touch her

They lie there silently with open eyes and they feel both
their closeness and the distance that separates them

After a while he raises his head on his arm and looks at her
for a long time as though he can see much more than just
the outlines of her face

BILL
Tell me about your dream

Bill says this once more as if she had been waiting for
his invitation

She holds out her hand to him he takes it and as he had
often done before he holds it and plays with her slender
fingers more absent-mindedly than tenderly

ALICE sighs and begins to speak uncertainly

ALICE
I think it started in my parents
house They werent there I was

alone That surprised me because

our wedding was the next day and I
didnt have a wedding dress Then
you and I were floating above a
ancient city It was a kind of crazy
mix of ancient architectural styles
Oriental Egyptian Greek and Roman
architecture And it was completely
deserted The streets were empty -
no people no animals And I remember
thinking so this is our honeymoon
Then it was night and the sky was so
full of stars and so blue and wide
it seemed like it was painted You
said it was the ceiling of our bridal
chamber and you took me in your arms
and made love to me and said you
would love me forever
BILL
I hope you loved me too

BILL says this with an invisible malicious smile

ALICE
Even more than you did me We made
love and it was wonderful though
there was a sadness to it anda
presentment of sorrow Suddenly it
was morning and we were somewhere in
the strange city We were still
completely alone But something
terrible had happened - our clothes
were gone I was terrified as I had
never been before and felt such a
burning shame that it almost consumed
me At the same time I was furious
with you because I thought it was
your fault And this sensation of
terror shame and fury was more
intense than any emotion I had ever
felt before You felt guilty and
rushed away naked to go and get
clothes for us As soon as you were
gone I felt wonderful I neither
felt sorry for you or worried about
you It was heavenly to be alone
I was lying in a lush garden
stretched out naked in the sunlight
and I was far more beautiful than I
ever was in reality And while I
lay there a young man walked out of
the woods He was the young Naval
officer I told you about from the
hotel He looked different but I
knew it was him He stopped in front
of me and looked at me searchingly
I laughed seductively and wantonly
as I have never laughed in my life
and he held out his arms to me and
sank down beside me ALICE falls
silent BILLS throat is parched
In the darkness of the room he can
see she has concealed her face in
her hands

BILL
A strange dream but thats not the
end is it

ALICE doesnt reply

BILL
Was that the end
ALICE
No
BILL
Then why dont you tell me the rest
of it
ALICE

Its not easy Some things are not
easy to say

BILL
Its was only a dream

ALICE sighs and continues hesitantly

ALICE
He looked at meand slowly took me
in his armsand we began making
love I seemed to live through
countless days and nights - there
was neither time nor space And the
more we made love the more our hunger
for each other increased And just
as that earlier feeling of terror
and shame went beyond anything I had
ever felt so nothing can be compared
with the freedom and happiness and
the desire that I now felt
Then I realized there other couples
around us - hundreds of them and
they too were making love Then I
was making love to the other men
and as soon as my longing was
satisfied with one I wanted another
I cant say how many I was with
And yet I didnt for one moment forget
you And all this time you were
buying the most beautiful clothes
and jewelery you could find for me
Then you were being followed by a
crowd of people who were shouting
threats Then you were seized by
soldiers and there were also priests
among them Somebody - a gigantic
person tied your hands You were
still naked I knew you were going
to be crucified but I felt no sympathy
for you I still blamed you for
everything that had happened
these slender
more acute

Involuntarily
hand before he lets it go

ALICE
I felt that I was far removed from
you but I knew you could see me naked
in the arms of countless men in this
sea of nakedness which foamed around
me The soldiers began to whip you
and blood flowed down you in streams
I saw it without feeling any surprise
or pity Then you smiled at me as
if to show you had fulfilled my wish
and bought me everything I wanted
But I thought your actions were
ridiculous and I wanted to make fun
of you - to laugh in your face
They began to nail you to the cross
and I hoped that you would be able
to hear my laughter And so I laughed
as shrill and loud as I could
That must have been the laugh that
you heard when I woke up Neither
of them moves or says anything Any
remark at this moment would seem
futile

BILL realizes he is still holding ALICES hand
She remains silent and motionless

Ready as he is to hate her his feeling of tenderness for
cool fingers is unchanged except that it is

He feels an incomprehensible desire to make love to her

He rolls over and puts his arm around her but then checks

As he closes his eyes he thinks

vVO
Whore of her dreams There is now a
sword between us We are lying here
like mortal enemies

he gently presses his lips on the familiar

ALICES eyes are closed and there is the trace of a happy
innocent smile playing about her mouth

He stretches himself out beside ALICE who now seems asleep

INT BILLS APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAWN
BILL rises at 6 oclock and dresses while ALICE is still
asleep He has only had a couple of hours sleep and looks
awful

On his way out he stops off in his daughters room She is
asleep in her bed He kisses her on the forehead

He collects his costume and leaves
EXT CAFE SONATA - DAY

Taxi pulls up and BILL gets out

He takes a cab to the Cafe Sonata where he met Nick
Nightingale

It is closed but he peers in through the window and sees the
chairs are stacked on the tables and the place is being
cleaned

He taps on the glass

After a couple of were closed wave-offs from the manageress
working at a table in the back the door is finally opened
by one of the cleaners

BILL
Good morning Id like to have a
quick word with the manager if I
may

CLEANING LADY
Someone for you Vicki

MANAGERESS
Okay

Bill walks to the table she is seated at

BILL
Good morning

MANAGERESS
What can I do for you

BILL
Its very important that I get in
touch with Nick Nightingale
MANAGERESS
Hell be in tonight

BILL
Its something I need to see him
about this morning

MANAGERESS
Its not our policy to give out
employees addresses

BILL

Of course I completely understand
But Im a doctor

(shows her his medical

card)
and this is a personal medical
matter I know hell want to know
about as soon as possible

EXT HOTEL JASON —- DAY
BILLs taxi pulls up Its a small mid-town hotel
INT - LOBBY

There is no one in the lobby except for the DESK CLERK a
man in his early thirties reading a paperback

BILL
Good morning

DESK CLERK
Good morning sir How can I help
you

BILL

Can you ring Mr Nightingales room
for me please

The DESK CLERK gives him a strange look

BILL
Nick Nightingale
DESK CLERK
Im sorry sir but hes checked

out
The DESK CLERK has a slight gay lisp

BILL
He checked out

DESK CLERK
Yes

BILL
Did he leave a forwarding address

DESK CLERK
No Im afraid not

BILL
When did he check out

DESK CLERK
About five oclock this morning

BILL
Five oclock Thats a pretty early
check out isnt it

DESK CLERK
It is a little bit on the early side

BILL
Did you happen to notice whether
there was there anything strange
about him when he left

DESK CLERK
You arent a detective by any chance

BILL
No Im a doctor Nick and I are
old friends

DESK CLERK
Well since you ask there was
something very strange about the way
Mr Nightingale left

BILL
What was that

DESK CLERK
Well he came in at about four-thirty
am There were two men with him -
big guys

The DESK CLERK bends his elbows and clenches his fists
make a big-guy gesture

DESK CLERK
And I noticed he had a bruise on his
cheek Im sure he didnt have the
night before

to

DESK CLERK
The two men with him were well-dressed
and well-spoken but they werent
the kind of people youd want to
fool around with if you know what I
mean Mr Nightingale said he would
be checking out and went up to his
room with one of the men The other
one stayed in the lobby and settled
his bill which was a couple of weeks
overdue When they came down I
thought Mr Nightingale looked
well - scared
Very scared if you ask me He tried
to pass me an envelope but they saw
him and took it away and said any
mail or messages for him would be
collected by a person properly
authorized to do so When they took
him outside I could see there was a
car waiting for them

BILL
No idea where they might have gone

DESK CLERK
None at all

INT

COSTUME SHOP - DAY

GIBSON
Ah-hhh the good doctor

BILL
Good afternoon

GIBSON
Did you enjoy your evening

BILL
Yes it was fine

BILL hands him the clothes Gibson carefully takes the them
out of the bag and lays them out on the counter to check

them

GIBSON
I think youve forgotten the mask
BILL
Oh - isnt it there

GIBSON
Its not here Maybe you left it at
the party

BILL

I dont know I must have lost it
Just put it on the bill

GIBSON
Okay and if it turns up just bring
it in and Ill give you a refund

BILL
Fine

BILL watches as GIBSON writes up the bill

BILL
I wonder if this might be a good
time to have a word or two about
your daughter

The question a peculiar expression about Gibsons nostrils

GIBSON
A word or two about my daughter

BILL speaks with outstretched fingers resting on the desk

BILL
Well its just that last night I
think you said that your daughter
was not quite normal mentally The
situation in which we found her
certainly suggests something like
that And since I took part in it
or was at least a spectator I feel
I should recommend that you get some
medical advice

GIBSON smiles at BILL insolently
GIBSON

And I suppose you yourself would
like to take charge of the treatment

At this moment a door which leads to one of the inner rooms

opens and a young man with a top-coat over his evening

clothes steps out

BILL recognizes him as one of the KIMONO men from the night
before

He also catches a glimpse of the YOUNG GIRL in bra and
panties getting dressed behind him before the door closes

The KIMONO MAN seems taken aback when he sees BILL but he
regains his composure at once

He lights a cigarette with a match from Gibsons counter
waves goodbye and leaves the shop

BILL
So thats how it is

GIBSON
(with perfect
equanimity)
What did you say

BILL
Last night you were going to call
the police

GIBSON
Weve come to another arrangement

Gibson slides the credit-card slip across the desk
BILL looks it over

GIBSON
Okay Its a hundred and fifty for
the basic rental Two hundred for
the inconvenience Twenty five for
the mask And Ive credited the
three hundred deposit Okay

BILL nods

GIBSON
And if the doctor should ever want
anything again
(smiles)
-it neednt be a monks costume

EXT BILLS SURGERY - DAY

BILL hails a taxi and makes a another deal to go to the house
in Long Island

EXT VARIOUS POVS - DAY

- 59th street Bridge

- LI Express way
EXT LONG ISLAND MANSION —- DAY

When the cab arrives there nothing suspicious is in sight
no cars or pedestrians

It stops a little past the house and BILL get out and walks
to the gates

The big gates are locked and there is no one in sight

He hears the faint whine of the zoom lens motor on one of
the surveillance cameras

He looks up anxiously but is determined to carry out his
inquiry

He rings the bell mounted on one of the gate pillars

He hears the motor on another surveillance camera as it
pans on to him

He waits

A few moments later a car slowly approaches down the road
from the house and stops at the gate

An elderly servant gets out and walks slowly to the gate

He holds a letter and without a word pushes it through the
iron bars to BILL whose heart is beating wildly

BILL
For me

The servant nods walks back to the car and drives back up
the road

BILL looks at the envelope and sees ‘Dr William Harford
written on it in a neat dignified handwriting

How did they know his name

He opens the envelope and unfolds a sheet of writing paper
Give up your inquiries which are completely useless and
consider these words a second warning We hope for your
own good that this will be sufficient

BILL stands there looking at the note

EXT CAB - DAY

Driving back to New York
INT CAB - DAY
BILL looks up from the letter thoughtfully

VO
Second warning Why the second
warning - and not the last
The tone of the note was strangely
reserved and seemed to show that the
people who sent it by no means felt
secure The note disappointed him
though in a way it reassured him
just why he couldnt say But at
least he now felt the woman had
come to no real harm and that it
would be possible to find her if he
went about it cautiously and cleverly

INT BILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

BILL is eating ALICE and HELENA with him keeping him

company at the table

Some simple natural dialog will be worked out for the action

over which the VO will be heard

VO
He had gone home feeling a little
tired but surprisingly cheerful
with a strange sense of security
which somehow seemed deceptive
He was in an excited and cheerful
mood and he felt unusually fresh and
clear in spite of spending the last
two nights without sleep At the same
time he felt that all this order
this normality all the security of
his existence was nothing but
deception and delusion

POV of ALICE smiling

vVO
And he thought there she sits with
an angelic look like a good wife
and mother - the whore of her dreams
who made love to a hundred men the
preceding night and laughed when he
was crucified and to his surprise
he didnt hate her

ALICE
Do you have to go out tonight

Im afraid so Ive got some patients
to see in the hospital

I was hoping she would have begun to
come to terms with things by now

Carl shakes his head
CARL

Shes taken it very hard And when

terrible

BILL
I suppose her relatives are with her
now

CARL

No they wont be coming until

Well good to see you again Its
unbelievable how much there is to do
to arrange a funeral

INT MARIONS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Marion opens the door

out

She is dressed in black Her face becomes slightly flushed
MARION
(smiling wearily)
You made me wait a long time
BILL
Im sorry Marion This was a

particularly busy day for me

In the living room Marion smiles and offers him a seat on
the couch sitting down next to him

BILL takes her hand in his and looks at her warmly

She makes little attempt to hide her desperate love

BILL
I bumped into Carl downstairs He
said youre going to Connecticut

tomorrow
She gazes into his eyes mournfully

MARION
I wont go if you dont want me to

BILL gives her a long look leans forward and kisses her on
the lips

They embrace and fall back on the couch
MARION
Oh Bill I love you I love you so

much

He kisses her and starts to fondle her breasts and other
regions

MARION
(whimpers )
Oh Bill I love you I love you

BILL
Marion

BILL just pronounces her name softly and continues to undo
her clothes

Then she begins to weep

BILL tries to ignore this but she doesnt stop
BILL
(whispers )
Whats wrong

At first MARION doesnt reply

BILL
Whats wrong

MARION
(smiling through her
tears)
Nothing

BILL
Nothing

BILL sits up

BILL
Martion what is the matter

MARION
Oh Bill its just that it all seems
so hopeless

BILL frowns

MARION
Whats going to happen to us

This is definitely not what BILL had in mind and he
away

MARION
Are you angry with me for saying
that

BILL

No of course not

MARION
You are angry

BILL
Im not angry

She rests her chin on his shoulder
MARION
Oh Bill Say something nice to

me I am so confused

BILL doesnt move

looks

BILL
Marion I guess this is crazy Im
a happily married man with a child
and you are engaged to Carl

Marions shoulders droop

BILL
Im sure the best thing for you to
do is to go Connecticut tomorrow
with Carl as you had planned A
complete change of environment and
the fresh air will do you a world of
good

Marion sits motionless and tears begin to stream down her
face

BILL sits in silence for a few moments feeling impatience
rather than sympathy

Then he looks at his watch and gets to his feet

BILL
Marion my dear much as I regret
it

He would gladly say something kinder to her but finds it
difficult to do so

BILL
If we dont see each other before
the wedding let me offer you my
most sincere congratulations and
best wishes

She doesnt move as though she understands neither his
congratulations nor his farewell

He holds out his hand but she refuses it and he says almost
reproachfully

BILL
I hope youll keep in touch and let
me know how you are

She sits there as if turned to stone

BILL
Goodbye Marion

He leaves the room stopping for a second in the doorway as
though giving her a last opportunity to call him back

But she turns her head away

bound to turn out a failure for him
But why should it be Wasnt the
fact that he had just escaped a

He had not slept for two days and
his nerves were gradually giving
way He intentionally struck up a
quicker pace than he was in the mood
for

Suddenly BILL feels he is being followed

He glances back and sees a man about half a block behind him

walking at the same rapid pace

As soon as the man notices BILL has seen him he stops and

looks in a shop window

on the door

menu

BILL
Ill havea cup of coffee

WAITRESS
Okay great

She leaves taking away the menu

BILL opens his eyes as wide as possible arches his neck and
drinks some water He looks terrible

He idly picks up the newspaper he just bought and starts to
look through it

A story catches his eye
EX-BEAUTY QUEEN IN HOTEL DRUGS OVERDOSE

Kelly Curran 30 a former Miss Wisconsin was taken to New
York Hospital this morning in critical condition after taking
a drugs overdose She was found unconscious when police
broke into her room at the San Carlos hotel after she failed
to respond to efforts to contact her

The night manager told police she had returned to the hotel
at four oclock in the morning accompanied by two unidentified
men

vVO
Four oclock in the morning The
same time he returned home
And accompanied by two men

vVO
Wasnt it two men who took Nick
Nightingale from his hotel only an
hour later There was no compelling
reason to believe that Kelly Curran
and a certain other woman were one
and the same And yet - his heart
throbbed and his hand trembled
BILL looks for the waitress to get his check

At the same time he notices the man who had been following
him sitting at another table

The man slowly raises a newspaper partly covering his face
BILL pays his check

At the door he turns to look for the suspicious character
at the table but he is already gone

He feels strangely relieved

Is the body in the hospital morgue

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR ON WAY TO MORGUE

BILL follows a black male orderly down a hospital corridor
INT MORGUE

The morgue is a brightly lit white-tiled room with six
autopsy tables and fifty numbered crypts There is no one

else working in the room

The black orderly checks a slip of paper and goes to that
crypt

He opens the door slides out the pallet and pulls down the
sheet covering the body

BILL stares down at the naked body of a young woman

The orderly gives BILL an inquiring look BILL nods and the
orderly crosses the room and lights a cigarette

BILL lifts the womans head a little
Her face is white Her half-closed eyes stare at him The
lower jaw hangs down limply the narrow upper lip is drawn

up revealing bluish gums and a beautiful set of white teeth

He gently lays her head back on the pallet

His eyes follow the lines of her body

He touches her forehead and her cheeks her shoulders and
her arms doing so as if compelled and directed to by an
invisible power

He twines his fingers about those of the corpse and rigid
as they are they seem to make an effort to move to seize
his hand

He bends over her as if magically attracted

vVO
Was this the woman he was seeking
Were these the eyes that had shone
at him the day before with so much
passion Was this the alluring body
for which only yesterday he had
felt such agonizing desire He bent
lower as if he could extract an
answer from the rigid features But
he had only seen her face for an
instant and he knew that if it were
her face and her eyes he would
not could not - and in reality did
not want to know He also realized
that from the time he read the account
in the newspaper he had imagined
her as having the features of his
wife And he shuddered to realize
that his wife had constantly been in
his minds eye as the woman he had
been seeking

He frees his fingers from those of the corpse and taking
her thin wrists places the ice cold arms alongside the body
very carefully

He looks at the orderly

BILL
Okay - thanks Im finished

Bill watches the orderly slide the pallet back into the crypt
and close the door

ORDERLY
Want to wash up Doc He gestures
to a row of sinks

BILL
Thanks

BILL goes over and carefully washes his hands with
disinfectant

His cellular phone goes off

Hello Yes Thats perfectly
all right Okay Oh I guess

There are only a few lights on inside giving the house a
more sombre appearance from the night of the Christmas party

The butler opens the door and takes BILLs coat
Zieglers assistant HARRIS appears

HARRIS
Good evening Dr Harford

BILL
Good evening

HARRIS
Thank you for coming over so quickly

BILL
What seems to be the problem

Im afraid I dont know Will you
follow me please

BILL follows HARRIS Their footsteps sound loud in the quiet
house

They stop in front of the library door and HARRIS knocks

ZIEGLER (0S)
Come in

HARRIS opens the door for BILL and closes it behind him
remaining outside

ZIEGLER gets up from an armchair and shakes hands
ZIEGLER

Hi Bill Sorry to drag you over
here at this time of night

BILL
No problem
ZIEGLER
What are you drinking
BILL
Well I suppose a brandy would be
nice
ZIEGLER

(going to the bar)
It was lovely to see you and Alice
the other night

BILL
It was a wonderful party and we had
a great time

ZIEGLER
Its a shame you had to leave so
early

BILL

We hated to go but I had a couple of
early appointments

ZIEGLER hands him his brandy and they touch glasses

BOTH
Cheers

BILL
Nice

ZIEGLER

Napoleon 1935

BILL looks suitably impressed

BILL
So - what seems to be the problem
Someone under the weather

ZIEGLER looks into his brandy glass

ZIEGLER
Can I be frank Bill

BILL
Of course

ZIEGLER
Im afraid what Ive got to say is a
bit awkward to talk about

BILL
Im your doctor

ZIEGLER rotates his brandy

ZIEGLER

This isnt a medical problem
BILL

Oh
ZIEGLER

No

BILL looks at him quizzically
ZIEGLER nods and returns a tense smile

ZIEGLER
Im not exactly sure how to begin
this But maybe the best thing is
to just to put the cards on the table
and say that I happen to know quite
a lot about what youve been doing
for the past twenty-four hours

He lets this sink in

BILL
Sorry Victor but may I ask what the
hell are youre talking about

ZIEGLER
(quietly)
Bill please believe me I know this
is awkward - perhaps as awkward for
me as it is for you Okay

Bill says nothing

ZIEGLER
Okay Now the reason I wanted
to talk to you is that I think you
may be harbouring one or two
misapprehensions about last night
which I would like to clear up

SILENCE

ZIEGLER
Okay I think I should also tell
you that I was there At the house

ZIEGLER says this in a very matter-of-fact way

ZIEGLER
I saw everything that happened

A long pause

BILL
Well what an amazing coincidence

ZIEGLER
The words practically right out of
my mouth An amazing coincidence
Thats what I first thought But
then I remembered seeing you and
your musician friend Nick renewing
old acquaintances at the party and
it didnt take me very long to realize
that the rotten little prick was the
reason you were there

Bill gets to his feet Theres no point in denying anything
and he has to protect Nick

BILL
Look Victor this was all my fault
Nick did his best to talk me out of
it

ZIEGLER
Yes I know He told us But the
fact remains that the little
cocksucker told you in the first
place and gave you the password and
the address

BILL
It was all down to me pressurising
him

ZIEGLER

Maybe so but I recommended him to
these people and he betrayed my trust

BILL hesitates

BILL
I went to his hotel this morning
ZIEGLER
I know

BILL
Hows that

ZIEGLER
That was my man following you He
told me you spotted him

BILL shakes his head incredulously

BILL
Why did you have me followed

ZIEGLER
For your own good To avoid any
foolishness

BILL
The hotel clerk said two men took
him away at five-thirty this morning

ZIEGLER
Thats right They gave him an
airline ticket and took him to the
airport By now hes probably back
with his family in Seattle

BILL
The clerk said he had a bruise on
his cheek

ZIEGLER
Is that all

BILL
Is he okay

ZIEGLER
Hes a lot better than he deserves
to be

BILL
Nothing else

ZIEGLER
Hes okay Phone him in Seattle if
youre concerned Ill give you his
phone number

ZIEGLER pours more brandy
BILL
Nick never said anything about a
second password Was that what gave
me away

ZIEGLER
There was no second password You
gave yourself away as soon as you
arrived Invited guests come in
limos not taxis and they dont get
out of their cars half a block from
the gate After the servants took
your coat one of our people went
through your pockets and found the
receipt for the rented tux and cassock
made out to Doctor W Harford a
name obviously not on the guest list

ZIEGLER sips some brandy

ZIEGLER
Bill these were not just ordinary
people I dont think you have any
idea how fortunate you are to have
got out of that situation as easily
as you did Someday you can thank
me for that

BILL
What about the woman

ZIEGLER
Not at all what you think

BILL
Why did she try to warn me

ZIEGLER doesnt answer immediately

BILL
Why was she willing to sacrifice
herself for me

ZIEGLER
Bill are you so sure she was the
kind of woman for whom the things
you imagined were actually a
sacrifice If she attended these
affairs and knew the rules so well
do you suppose it would have made
any difference to her whether she
belonged to one of the men or to
all of them

ZIEGLER
Bill she was just a thousand-a-night-
hooker - no more no less

BILL stares at him blankly

ZIEGLER
Bill tell me did you never consider
the possibility that the whole thing
might have been nothing more than a
charade A charade played out
for the benefit of someone who didnt
belong - to frighten them and make
sure they keep quiet

BILL takes a deep breath and tries to absorb what he has
just been told Then takes the newspaper from his pocket with
the story about the drugs overdose

BILL
What about this

ZIEGLER
What about it

BILL
Is it her I went to the morgue but
I couldnt tell

ZIEGLER
It is her

BILL
(quietly)
Is this what she meant when she said
she would redeem me

ZIEGLER
No - it wasnt But I was afraid
you might think it was and thats
why I wanted to see you

BILL
You say it was a charade but isnt
it a bit strange a woman offers
herself as a sacrifice and the next
morning shes dead

ZIEGLER
That was a coincidence An amazing
coincidence perhaps but a genuine
coincidence nonetheless Bill
please believe me nothing happened
to her that hadnt happened before

ZIEGLER
She got a lot of attention that was
certainly true but nothing she didnt
want And later when my people
left her at the hotel they said
everything was absolutely okay
What then happened in her room she
did to herself as she had done many
times before But sadly this would
be the last time She ODd on crack
like the papers said No chance for
foul play Her door was locked from
the inside and the police had to
break it down No Im afraid for
her it was always going to be just a
matter of time - you said as much
yourself when she passed out in my
bedroom at the Christmas party

BILL
My God was that her

ZIEGLER nods yes
Several moments of strained silence go by

Then ZIEGLER stands up with a comfortable end-of-conversation-
sigh

ZIEGLER
So Bill I hope you understand why
I thought it was important to tidy
this up But now I think all the
dishes are washed and put away
Nobody killed anybody Someone died
Thats sad But life goes on It
always does Until it doesnt
Okay

INT BILLS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bill quietly enters and goes to his study to undress as he
did the night before

He enters the bedroom as quietly as possible

He hears ALICE breathing softly and regularly and sees the
outline of her head on the pillow

Unexpectedly his heart is filled with a feeling of tenderness
and even of security

Then he notices something dark quite near ALICES face

It has definite outlines like the shadowy features of a human
face and it is lying on his pillow

For a moment his heart stops beating but an instant later
he sees what it is and stretching out his hand picks up
the MASK he had worn the night before

VO
He thought he must have dropped it
in the morning when he packed the
costume away and Alice had found it
and placed it on the pillow beside
her as though it signified his face
the face of a husband who had become
an enigma to her All at once he
reaches the end of his
strengthClutching the mask he utters
a loud and painful sob - quite
unexpectedly - and sinks down beside
the bed buries his head in the
pillows and cries A minute later
he feels a soft hand caressing his
hair

He looks into ALICES worried eyes

BILL
I will tell you everything

ALICE raises her hand as if to stop him but he takes it
and holds it

BILL
No I will tell you everything

BEDROOM - IT IS NOW DAWN
The grey light creeps through the curtains

ALICE sits expressionlessly at a small table near the window
finishing a cigarette A full ashtray next to her

BILL sits miserably on the edge of the bed staring at the
carpet

He sighs and looks at Alice
She smiles at him sadly and reaches out her hand
He gets up slowly and goes over to her

BILL
What are we going to do now

She gazes into his eyes

ALICE
I think we should both be grateful
that we have come unharmed out of
all our adventures whether they
were real or only a dream

BILL kneels down in front of her

BILL
Are you really sure of that

She takes his hands in hers and looks at them

ALICE
Only as sure as I am that the reality
of one night let alone that of a
whole lifetime is not the whole
truth

BILL
And no dream is entirely a dream

She presses his head to her breast

ALICE
But I think were awake now And
for a long time to come

BILL
Forever

Almost before he finishes the word ALICE lays her fingers
on his lips

ALICE
(whispers as if to
herself)
We should never look into the future

They kiss tenderly and lie down on the bed dozing a little
dreamlessly close to one another - until with the usual
noises from the street and a victorious ray of sunlight
through the opening of the curtain there is a knock on the
door and their seven-year-old daughter HELENA runs into
the room and laughing jumps into their bed And a new day
begins

THE END
