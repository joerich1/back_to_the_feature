EXT WASHINGTON DC -- NIGHT
SUPER DECEMBER 22 2009 2 AM

The full moon is a silver ball shimmering on the smooth black
surface of the winter Potomac We hear the droning of
millions a Babel of tongues the electronic communications
of the entire city In the mix we hear

RADIO VOICE (0S)
The president said today that the
western world should expect to be
at war with Islamist terrorism for
a hundred years

Then as we glide up toward the Washington Monument

RADIO VOICE (0S)

A UN spokesman today estimates that
ongoing tribal warfare in the Sudan
has already killed half a million
people and may topple the entire
region into famine

Up a steep embankment stands the Washington Monument
illuminated Another voice rises from the mix
VOICE (0S)
Is is this the DC police

POLICE OPERATOR (0S)
Can I help you

VOICE (0S)
There’s something on the sidewalk
outside the Washington Monument

A large bundle three feet- by-three feet wrapped neatly in
brown paper and twine on the circular sidewalk at the base

VOICE (0S)
I thought you should know It might
be a bomb or something

A beat

Floodlights turn on Police run from a nearby guard shack
Distant sirens wail

Howling police cars in the distance We pan away from the
Monument toward the illuminated Capitol then south to the
The Air and Space Museum

Emergency vehicles flash past on Constitution Avenue as a
large crane at a construction site comes to life It crawls
up the sidewalk and crunches up a few steps to a patio just
outside a slanting museum atrium FOUR BLACK-CLAD RAIDERS
shoot hooks trailing ropes to the top and securing them run
up the steeply angled glass ceiling slapping palm-sized
globs of plastic explosive at intervals as they go When all
four reach the top one pushes a button and the globs blow
sending the glass ceiling crashing down into the building

INT AIR AND SPACE MUSEUM

The four invaders rope down from the open ceiling to the
Apollo Lunar Excursion Module the LEM a relic of the Moon
missions It is 20-feet high TWO SECURITY GUARDS run toward
the noise

GUARDS POV The glass ceiling is in shards around it The
full Moon is visible in the opening above One of the guards
is about to speak into his walkie-talkie when he and the
other are grabbed from behind and subdued
EXT LAFAYETTE PARK

In the empty seven-acre park directly across the street from
the White House a driverless truck careens through gardens
toward the White House It bounces out to a portion of
Pennsylvania Avenue closed to traffic and collides hard with
concrete security barriers exploding in a great fireball
throwing pieces of flaming debris against the high front gate
and over it to the White House lawn

Washington is one big emergency siren Helicopters overhead

INT MUSEUM

Ignored by the racing emergency vehicles outside a large
hook lowers from the arm of the crane through the open
atrium The invaders work on the LEM with blowtorches to
sever the ascent stage from the descent portion

One of them a young woman climbs to the top of the LEM A
blue-handled dagger is strapped to her calf It is ANYA
POLONIEV 27 slender fit dark-haired and all-business as
she guides the hook down and loops thin steel cables over it
The straps form a basket for the upper stage of the craft
and it is lifted straight up and through the roof

EXT MUSEUM

Sirens blaring all over the city the ascent stage is lowered
to a flatbed truck where FOUR MEN pull a huge tarp over it
and secure it The hook swings back toward the atrium

INT MUSEUM

Anya hands one of the guards an envelope and they watch as
the descent portion is lifted out in the same way Anya and

the three others stand on each of its legs

Where the LEM had stood is an envelope and written in larger
letters on it is “I0U”

Walk with me

Ridder follows Drake out of his office down a hall and out
a door

EXT WHITE HOUSE BACK LAWN

Drake strides into a cinder walking path The lawn slopes
downhill Washington Monument in the distance The path
follows the perimeter fence Drake is pumping a hand
exerciser as he strides along belly first

DRAKE
What in everlasting hellfire
happened last night

Ridder struggles to keep pace He is carrying a briefcase

RIDDER
Weve been working it all day sir
We think this is related to the
theft of that Topaz reactor last
week from Moscow University
DRAKE
How

RIDDER
Some kind of international group
NGO tree-huggers They call
themselves Luna We believe they
have got hold of an old Soviet
Proton booster

DRAKE
Why

RIDDER
Because according to their new web
site they intend to go back to the
Moon and none of NASA’s rockets
are missing

DRAKE
The Moon

RIDDER
I know It gets weirder They
intend to leave someone there too
They call it the “Lighthouse” like
the way mariners left lighthouse-
keepers in islands to guide them
Watch this

He takes Drake’s hand exercisers and hands him an i-Phone

RIDDER
This video came up on a their
website yesterday It opens with a
shot of earthrise from the Moon
and a quote from Whitman which
I’ve spared you This is the
pertinent part

He presses a button and the video plays

We are going back to the Moon
because the Moon enables us to see
the Earth whole to see it as it
is life’s fragile foothold in the
darkness The technology to go and
to leave a permanent settlement
there is not some futuristic dream

past They are gathering dust in
museums and laboratory basements
all over the world We are
liberating them

Shot from a distance by a jerky handheld camera we see a
bound guard and TWO MEN in black masks driving an odd-
looking vehicle a lunar rover out garage doors from a
warehouse at Carnegie Mellon University The rover approaches
rapidly with TWO MORE GUARDS chasing on foot but falling
behind As it travels up a ramp into the back end of a
tractor trailer one of the drivers waves at the CAMERAMAN to
hurry and the image flails wildly for a moment as he
scrambles to join them on the truck The picture steadies
looking out the back end of the truck as it pulls away the
masked men pulling its doors shut leaving the guards in the
road

essential first step We will --

EXT WHITE HOUSE BACK LAWN

Ridder hits the stop button takes the phone back Drake
resumes his brisk walk his deputy giving chase

RIDDER
They have a list Eleven things
they intend to steal Most of the
necessary technology needed is off-
the-shelf nowadays but there are
things they can’t buy or make
essential but highly-specialized
items She doesn’t say what they
are
DRAKE
But three of them are the Topaz
that rover and the LEM

Ridder hands a paper to Drake Nine items are listed 1)
Proton rocket 2) Soyuz capsule 3)spacesuits 4) Lunar
habitat 5) H20 converter 6) Helium 3 Miner 7) Topaz mini-
reactor 8) lunar rover 9) LEM

RIDDER
These are the nine things they’ve
stolen They leave these I0Us

Drake studies the list as he walks

DRAKE
At least they’re polite What are
ten and eleven

He hands the paper back

RIDDER
We’re working on it

DRAKE
Who is funding this Jesus the
last thing the world needs is
somebody starting a stampede to the

some sort of fuck-you doctoral
thesis that lays out a stripped-
down low-cost high-risk Moon
mission complete with thrust
vectors orbital speeds fuel
ratios escape geometry it
appears to be the blueprint they’re
following He itemized ten things
that would have to be stolen NASA
describes him as young off-the-

Where is this boy wonder now

The Jeep gets hung up behind a line of school buses

RIDDER (0S)
Some posh private observatory in
Colorado Big salary It does
research education outreach
nothing as exciting as what he was
doing at NASA We’re thinking --

covered with Moon posters photos maps His bookshelves are
full of volumes about space aeronautics astronomy and
there are models of the Moon spacecraft etc Cole drops
his backpack on his chair

Cole follows Robinson down the hall and they pass into the
observatory chamber

INT OBSERVATORY CHAMBER

It is an enormous space under the great dome and a giant
telescope nearly fills it pointed at the rounded unopened

base of the viewing scope where a foot-long metal tube its
eyepieceis unscrewed and sitting upright on a tray Robinson
picks up the new two-inch-wide lens off a piece of soft
cloth and sets it in the opening at the top of the eyepiece
It doesn’t drop into place Its circumference appears to be a
micrometer off

COLE
Can we use to old lens

ROBINSON
Not with your new software We’re
going to be showing them images
that look like this

On a monitor alongside is an image of the Moon that looks
like it has been shot through three inches of gauze

We are busy here

DIANE
I’m sorry to interrupt Mr

We would like to ask you some
questions

COLE

Id invite you in to sit down but
one of you

(an invitingly look at

Perry)
is going to have to sit on my lap

PERRY
(unamused)
Well stand

Cole moves over to his seat He cranks open the window and
sticks the lens in a bank of snow Robinson appears in to

doorway and makes a face at Cole as if to say What am I

going to do now Cole shrugs helplessly

Perry has a thick file She pulls out a picture of the stolen
LEM

COLE
Is this about the LEM Shit my
apartment isnt even big enough for
me and my cat

REID
Cute little tabby

Cole is shocked They’ve been to his apartment He drops the
attitude

COLE
What do you want from me

PERRY

You have a curious career track
Mr Nealson Masters Degree from
MIT Your professors there say
you were some kind of prodigy
You’re working toward a doctorate
there while heading a NASA program
in Pasadena to design

(she refers to the notes)
Extraterrestial Sustainable
Habitats and then you go off the
rails You resign drop your
doctoral program and take this job
baby sitting a big telescope

COLE
Who doesn’t like astronomy So Im
downwardly mobile Is that a crime
You make it sound like I planned it
that way

She pulls out a thick document and drops it in his lap Sixty
pages The title RIP THE MOON Cole is puzzled

COLE
How did you get this

REID
Were the FBI which means we do
have the Internet

COLE
I never posted this anywhere I
wrote it when I left NASA I was
pissed off

PERRY
What pissed you off

COLE
We weren’t going anywhere Not to
the Moon to Mars Nowhere other
than in circles around the Earth
Not in my lifetime We gave up
(MORE)

COLE (contd)
What do you do when you realize
that the thing you have worked
toward your whole life is not going
to happen

REID
You tell us

Cole hands the document back to Perry

COLE
Well one thing you do it write a
thesis that explains exactly how
the thing they say CANT be done
can be done and for one-tenth the
cost and you realize the whole
time that it doesnt mean shit
because nobody is ever going to
read it and then you go finda
good job where you can ski and be
close to your kid I never even
submitted it

REID
I should say not its a blueprint
for a criminal conspiracy You
didn’t show it to anyone

COLE
My thesis advisor

REID
When’s the last time you saw or
heard from Dr Tom Scheye

COLE
Not since I left NASA

Perry gestures at the document

PERRY
Page Four

Cole flips to the page and sees his list of ten essentials
for the mission items that would have to be stolen

PERRY
What if I told you that nine of the
things on your list have been
stolen

Cole sees now why he is a suspect He is also intrigued
COLE
Oh come on You cannot be serious

PERRY
Somebody seems to be

COLE
What You think whoever these
people are they’re planning to go
to the Moon

REID
One of these items is a small
nuclear reactor That got our
attention

Cole lets this sink in for a minute

COLE
Then whoever they are trust me
theyre fucked I wrote this in my

horizontally

Find me someplace soft to put this
thing down

HACK
Hold on I’m going to try

something

EXT LUNAR SKY

The LEM tilts again and the descent engine fires once more
The horizontal speed is greatly reduced and a craft tilts
upright again

INT LEM
SERGET
Two thousand feet Still too much

horizontal

HACK
We’ll have to live with it

SERGET
One thousand

Hack is wrestling with the controls The craft to vibrating
from the descent engine shaking hard Hack is looking out
the window now searching for a smooth spot on a very rocky
surface Abruptly out the window the ground falls away a
cliff the surface is now hundreds of feet further below

HACK
(alarmed)
Crater There’s not supposed to be
a crater here

SERGEI
(shouting)
We overshot our landing area

HACK
More juice

EXT LUNAR SURFACE

The descent engine is blazing as the LEM upright but still
racing horizontally slows its descent and starts to rise
again slightly It is fast approaching the opposite cliff
the other side of the crater and Hack having reversed the
descent is now inching it up higher and higher trying to
clear the looming crater wall

He doesn’t make it clipping the rim with the legs of the
lander The craft pitches over violently on its side and
comes apart The entire descent portion legs and engine and
frame tears away breaking open and spewing its contents
down the sloping outer rim of the crater

The upper ascent portion of the craft which contains the
crew crashes sideways into the surface which is amazingly
soft deep gray powder finer and softer than sand flies up on
all sides as the craft bounces once twice and then settles
into a long skid down the gentle slope scraping a divot in
the thick powder as it skids to a stop hundreds of yards
downhill The dust that flies away goes off hundreds of feet
before settling back down

The Luna is on its side Behind it far up the slope the
contents of the descent stage litter the side of the crater
rim on both sides of the divot

INT LEM

Cole Anya Hack and Sergei are tangled in a heap inside
the upended LEM but they are uninjured

Miraculously the skin of the craft has not ruptured They
still have air pressure and oxygen

COLE
(to Anya)
You OK

She nods rubbing a shoulder Cole crawls over to a window
and looks out the surface of the Moon It is magnificent
and desolate and gray In the distance is a jagged mountain
range The line of the horizon is stark black The light off
the lunar soil is brilliant unbelievably crisp Uphill is
the jagged rim of the crater they clipped on the way down
Anya’s eyes are alight with excitement and disbelief

ANYA
We’re here Mon Dieu Look We made
it

Hack is throwing people off him frantically scrambling to do
an immediate damage assessment

HACK
We made it all right but this
might be our last stop

INT NASA CONTROL ROOM

Keane is watching his monitor with THREE TECHNICIANS behind
her

KEANE

Did they crash

KEANE
I don’t know Their air speed way
high and then boom they stopped
moving Somebody get Colonel

INT LEM

Hack and Sergei are inspecting every corner of the craft It
remains pressurized and filled with oxygen Cole has the
sextant and is peering out of the window trying to fix their
position Anya is at another window

ANYA
Can we get this back upright

SABURO
To be in a different place is
nothing to get excited about To be
is the excitement

SERGEI
(rolling his eyes)
Aren’t Buddhas supposed to be
silent

Hack has climbed to the back end of the craft He is
scrutinizing the fuel tank for the ascent engine a thick
silver cylinder that is the largest object in the LEM and
the most vital single item in their inventory because
without it they are all stranded He sees a portion of the
outer shell has folded in against it and notices that the
fuel gauge on top indicates the tank is no longer full It
has lost about two thirds of its contents and the needle is
vibrating

HACK
(bellowing)
Suit up Now I’m going out

They all hurriedly pull on helmets hook up portable oxygen

EXT LUNAR SURFACE -- MOMENTS LATER

The hatch swings open and Hack crawls out He bounds down to
the surface and lands softly knee-deep in dust and moves
swiftly toward the upended rear of the craft He climbs up to
get a look at the top of the ascent engine and spies a tiny
jet of white vapor revealing the leak He places his finger
over it and roots in a tool kit hanging from his neck for
material to patch it

Sergei Anya Saburo and Cole emerge easing themselves down
to the surface unsteady in one-sixth gravity They
communicate by radios inside their helmets Anya joyously
performs a stunning exaggerated pirouette launching herself
and flying six feet high turning and then landing and
tumbling head over heels

ANYA

(giggling)
Splendide

Cole and Saburo attempt long strides each one launching them
three feet high and six yards out

COLE
This is incredible

Sergei circles the craft and sees Hack patching the tank

SERGEI
How bad is it

HACK
Bad

Cole Anya and Saburo turn in slow circles overcome by the
magnificent desolation the absolute clarity of the sunlit
landscape unfiltered by atmosphere Distant objects are seen
with the same clarity as those nearby They are filled with
wonder Saburo kicks his foot and dust flies off ina
straight trajectory a great distance

A few feet away from the craft the depth of the powder is
markedly thinner in some places only as deep as their
ankles They are stunned to be here Cole points and Anya
looks up at the glorious blue ball in the black sky

ANYA
It is hard to believe but there’s
our entire world all of human
history politics religion war
science art --

A howling noise in their headsets

HACK
(bellowing livid)
You worthless bitch

He comes literally flying out at Anya and knocks her down He
is on her back his face twisted in rage reaching for the
tube supplying oxygen to her suit Saburo Cole and Sergei
pull him off and restrain him

HACK
(screaming)
Leave me alone I’m going to kill
that fucking bitch

Anya gets back to her feet her hand closed around the blue-
handle of the dagger she keeps strapped to her calf Hack is
enraged

HACK
(pointing)
Acceptable Level of Risk What did
I tell you Stay within mission
parameters This is your fault

COLE
What What’s her fault

SERGET
We’re stranded We lost our fuel

HACK
We’re fucked That’s what we are
All of us Stranded We are all
going to die here

Hack bounds off up the slope in great long leaps Cole
climbs back into the LEM Behind him is Sergei

INT LEM

Cole and Sergei stare at the gauge The needle is steady but
the tank is only one-third full

COLE
Oh shit

SERGEI
Hack was right We were too heavy
Without ground control we couldn’t
manage the landing

Anya appears behind them

ANYA
We’re stuck

As Sergei climbs back out Cole notices for the first time
that hanging from a strap in his tool kit slung over one
shoulder is a handgun

EXT CRATER SLOPE

Hack is rooting through the remains of the descent portion of
the LEM tossing aside pieces of the thin foil paneling
which fly remarkable distances He finds the descent engine
fuel tanks They are ruptured and empty Hack hurls one that
flies all the way over the rim of the crater and far into
empty space He slumps down and sits

HACK
Fucked Fucked Fucked

EXT LEM

Sergei climbs back out to the surface Cole sits on the open
hatch of the overturned LEM holding the sextant and the
laptop

SERGEI
Okay everybody listen to me We
have oxygen and water and food to
last us twenty days That gives us
twenty days to work on this
problem

COLE
Actually less than that

Sergei and the others look at him alarmed

COLE
The way I figure our position we
have less than four full days until
dark The temperature here will go
from oven to deep freeze The LEM
and these spacesuits are not meant
to survive lunar night and we
could all cram in the hab only
wed deplete the oxygen in a matter
of hours

A moment of stunned depressed silence

SERGEI

(deflated)
Then I suggest we do what we can in
the time we have left I brought
this mining equipment here and I
intend to see if it works If any
of us is to make it we will need
the hab So we are going to go to
work

He steps away turns and looks up the hill at Hack who is
still seated where he dropped

SERGET
Hack

Hack makes no move Sergei shrugs and starts uphill toward
the debris field where Saburo is already dragging components
downhill

Anya walks over to the LEM and looks up at Cole with tears in
her eyes

ANYA
I’m sorry You were right

Cole ignores her He takes a reading from the sextant and
enters it into the laptop

COLE
We’re not dead yet

wrappings litter her desk She is peering at lunar satellite
photographs from the Japanese lunar orbiter A technician
looks over his shoulder

KEANE

Yep Looks like they bought it

She points to the edge of a large crater The line scraped by
the crashing LEM is visible and the craft itself along with
the portions of the descent stage and its contents can be
seen as black spots in the uniformly gray surface

INT CAMPALONG’S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER

Campalong inspects the photos at his desk as Keane and Ridder
look over his shoulder He doesn’t disguise his
disappointment

CAMPALONG
They must have clipped the rim of
the crater Judging by the divot
their horizontal velocity was way
too high

KEANE
Looks like they just missed
slamming into the crater wall here
(pointing)
Hack could always fly that thing

RIDDER
Could any of them have survived

CAMPALONG
The LEM wasn’t built to hold
together in a crash like that and
they probably went in pressurized
so they wouldn’t have a chance when
the craft came apart It happened
quick but it wasn’t pretty Even
if the impact didn’t kill them
it’s hot enough up there to slow
roast a turkey Space is no place
for amateurs

Ridder is pleased He steps out into the doorway and places a
call on his cell Campalong and Keane overhear and are
disgusted by his satisfaction They know their assistance
might have helped avoid the crash

(to phone)
Have you given any thought sir to
how this should be handled I mean
with the press Colonel Campalong

nuclear generator is up and running and thick yellow and
black cables connect it to the various components of the
working site The long delta-shaped habitat is inflated and
pressurized about half the size of a mobile home It’s sides
arch up to a point The ribs of it have been unfolded
accordion-like from its housing which serves as a transit
chamber There are large tanks of liquid 02 set alongside
Saburo is filling bags with lunar soil and stacking them
along the base of the hab

(singing)
Words are flowing out like endless
rain into a paper cupThey slither
while they pass They slip away
across the universe

Sergei is working the H3 miner which looks like a small
garden tractor with a scoop on the front and a big red
cylinder on the back Dirt is scooped into the device which
is cooked in its innards releasing H3 gas into a red metal
cylinder mounted on the back

The rover is parked alongside the LEM and behind it are
tracks up and down the slope from where Anya and Cole have
been scavenging pieces of the shattered lander The LEM is
closed and pressurized

Anya and Cole are before the LEM alongside a heap of aluminum
tubing Cole is crouching working at a circular metal frame
a remnant from the mounting of a landing pad

ANYA
I know it’s awful but have you
given any thought yet to how you
would prefer to you know end
it

Cole ignores her

ANYA
Saburo and I were talking and we
figured we would rather freeze than
suffocate I’m told that’s not a
bad way to go

COLE
You’re told Who would know such a
thing

He has removed the cover of the rim and is picking three-
quarter-inch round silver ball bearings out of it and putting
them in his pockets

ANYA
What are those

COLE
Ball bearings

ANYA
I know what they are Why do you
want them

COLE
You never know what might come in
handy Did you know your friend
Sergei has a weapon

ANYA
What

COLE
Looked like a Glock to me In his
bag You can add that to your list
of ways to check out

ANYA
Would that even fire here

COLE
Without any doubt It’s a chemical
reaction Spark Bang Hell of a
kick though

ANYA
Is Hack still in there

COLE
He’s lost it We’ll have to keep an
eye on him I think he plans to
kill you That expands your list to
four

ANYA
Pourquoi I would just die a few
days earlier

COLE
Not necessarily

She looks at him again intrigued

ANYA
How are we going to take off in
this It is not even facing in the
right direction

COLE
That’s no problem I figure it
weighs just over half a ton up
here We can use this rim some of
these metal rods some wire and
rig a pulley

(MORE)

COLE (contd)
I can weld these slats together to
create a cradle for it and
together we can lift her upright
and set her in It will take about
a day

ANYA
Cole we don’t have enough fuel

COLE
There is that

Sergei carrying a full red cylinder of H3 approaches

SERGET
For what it’s worth the H3 miner
works as advertized

COLE
Sergei what do you know about the
Surveyor program

SERGEI
American robotic landers They sent
them up in advance of the manned
Apollo missions

COLE
The way I figure our position
were in the Sinus Medii and
Surveyor Six is about eighty miles
northeast

Sergei is suddenly very interested

SERGET
Fuel

COLE
Good old Aerozine Fifty lifeblood
of rocketry There should be some
left Six was designed to test soft
landings but the craft froze
during the lunar night before they
got to do it more than once If you
found it could you extract the
fuel from its tanks

SERGEI
Yes Of course It’s a simple
electric valve I could use the
cylinders we brought for H3

ANYA
You are a genius Cole

SERGEI
This is good good thinking

COLE

It’s a very slender thread Those
tanks have been alternately baking
and freezing up here for more than
thirty years Still Aerozine is
remarkably stable

(to Sergei)
You and Hack take the rover and
find it I’1ll draw you a map

SERGEI
No We’ll send Hack He’s worthless
to us right now and I want to
continue mining If we do find
enough fuel this
(holding up the cylinder)
is why I came

Sergei climbs excitedly up the step to the LEM hatch and
bangs on it

INT LEM -- MINUTES LATER
Hack and Sergei have their helmets off Hack is stone-faced

Got to give the kid credit But
even if there is fuel left in that

from the start all this bullshit
about a Lighthouse That hab will
never work We should have come by

kidnaps this wingnut That’s why
were in this fix

Campalong sits and rolls the chair over to Keane’s monitor
He leans in

KEANE
The Kaguya has been snapping away
on every orbital pass Here’s the
first shots

On the screen Keane calls up the original photo
KEANE
Now look at this four hours
later

The dots on the screen have moved

CAMPALONG
Show me those shots side by side

The pictures on the screen are clearly different

CAMPALONG
It could be a lot of things Maybe
an oxygen or fuel tank ruptured

KEANE
That’s what I thought at first
too But look at this

She puts up a newer photo The material scattered at first
has all been grouped together

KEANE
When was the last time an explosion
moved things closer together

Holy shit They’re alive The poor

Campalong stands and starts to pace He leans back in for
another look

CAMPALONG

Okay Fuck this Here’s what we do
Get the rest of your team in here
Try to establish radio contact and
lets start trouble-shooting this
Not a word to anyone outside out
team got it I’1ll get Kaguya to
try and move in closer Washington
be damned we’re not going to just
sit here and let them die up there

Keane jumps up and plants a kiss on Campalong’s cheek She
starts across the room

CAMPALONG
Jules do you have any friends with

EXT MOON CAMP

Tubing from the descent portion has been used to form a
triangular frame over the LEM and the rim has been mounted
at the apex as a pulley The LEM now sits upright cradled
securely above a jury-rigged launch platform It is closed
and pressurized The hab is also closed tight Saburo’s wall
of dirt sacks reaches about halfway up one side

Sunlight filters in now from just the small portion at the
top of the hab uncovered by the bags The hab looks lived-in
Vegetation in the biomass chamber is evident and healthy
Saburo has rows of potted plants lining shelves

Helmets off and out of their space suits Saburo is ina
peculiar yoga position standing easily on one hand

SABURO
How soon ‘til we get cable up here

Anya rolls her eyes

SABURO
Kidding

Anya and Cole are intently watching a long tapered aluminum
tube stretching from the H20 converter -- it looks like a
misshapen metal box -- over the opening to a large glass
beaker

SABURO
If we have not enough fuel for
launch we could all chant Kannon
Sutra over and over and use
positive energy to lift the ship
back into orbit

COLE
It’s a nice thought Saburo but
there’s physics involved

SABURO
Still even if the ship stops too
soon it is wonderful practice
doing Kanzeon together

Slowly a drop of pure water forms at the tip of the tube
larger and larger and plunks a drop into the beaker

ANYA
It works

She throws her arms around Cole

COLE
Well see

Another drop falls Then another

ANYA
Water Cole Water from lunar dirt
That means oxygen and life It
works This THIS is an act of
genius

her back

No Saburo It’s okay

Saburo bows and exits into the transit chamber lightly
closing the inner hatch and rotating the handle leaving Cole
and Anya alone

They retreat from further intimacy

COLE
There’s something I didn’t tell
Sergei

ANYA
What

COLE

Surveyor Six is about eighty miles
northeast which means Fra Mauro
where Apollo 14 landed is only
thirty miles southwest

ANYA
Apollo 14 How does anyone know
these things

COLE
The Moon was my life Anya For
almost twenty years I know there’s
fuel left in Apollo’s descent
tanks Alan Shepherd plunked
Antares right down pretty as you
please Best landing in the series
There has got to be fuel left in
the descent tanks more even than
the Surveyor

ANYA
Do you think Cole that’s
wonderful

COLE
Well have to find it first

ANYA
Why didn’t you tell Sergei and
Hack

COLE

I wanted to get rid of them Sergei
stayed behind but that’s OK It
could still work

ANYA
What could still work

COLE
If Hack comes back with enough fuel
for just the two of them theyd
leave us behind for sure

ANYA
They wouldn’t do that
COLE
Are you willing to bet your life on
it
Anya is silent
COLE

You will have to come with me
because if I leave you behind I
think Hack will kill you If we can
reach Apollo 14 on foot we can
harvest enough fuel to take us all
up We have to wait for the right
time but we should go soon

ANYA
What’s to stop them from doing just
as you fear leaving without us

COLE
I’m going to disable the LEM

Anya takes this in
COLE
Anya if we try this we might not
make it back We could easily run
out of oxygen on the way It’s hard
to navigate All the terrain is so
similar and I’m just going to be
guessing at the location of Apollo

ANYA
Then won’t they be stranded if we
don’t make it back We would doom
them as well I cannot --

COLE

They have the rover Anya As soon
as they realize I’ve disabled the
LEM they’1l1 follow us If we die
they’11 find us and the missing
parts Hack will know how to put
them back

She ponders

COLE
It’s a long shot at best but they
won’t get enough fuel from Surveyor
to lift us all off

Anya bows her head and makes the sign of the cross

COLE
What are you doing

ANYA
I’m praying on it

Cole shakes his head with wonder watching her

COLE
After all that has happened to you
losing your parents crashing on
the Moon you still pray to the God
who did all that

ANYA
God did not do those things Cole
people did people who have
forgotten God But look what else
people can do

She gestures around the hab and smiles then returns to her

prayer

Cole picks up a metal tube about four feet long removes one
of the ball bearings from his pocket and holds it up to one
end of the tube Too large He roots through some of the
other tubes and find one thicker The ball bearing slides
into the opening of the tube a perfect fit

leads are attached to a battery with a switch Cole is taping
the battery to the back end of the tube Anya awakens

Okay I’1l wait outside

He exits and Campalong closes the door

CAMPALONG
Dr Scheye it’s a pleasure to meet
you What have they told you about
your friends

DOC
Luna

CAMPALONG
Right What do you know

DOC
They crashed into the Moon no
thanks to you

CAMPALONG
Right so far But what if I was to
tell you that they survived

DOC
Theyre alive

CAMPALONG
Some of them are They crashed but
take a look at these

He slides the Kaguya pictures to him Doc looks at the
sequence

DOC
They’re setting up camp I was told
they’d all been killed

CAMPALONG
That’s what the world thinks at
least so far We’re working on it

Doc gets it He recognizes in Campalong an ally

CAMPALONG
Now look at this

He slides Doc two more pictures

CAMPALONG
I’ve had Kaguya lower its orbit and
it is shooting pictures of the
Sinus Marii on every pass

They pictures show the long tracks made by the rover In the
sequence taken over hours the rover has traveled a great
distance

DOC
The rover What’s the heading

CAMPALONG
Northeast 70 degrees Somebody
from the group has gone off in
search of something If they were
exploring or sightseeing they
would have taken a circular route
This is a straight line with a few
course corrections They are
looking for something particular
Do you know what it is

Doc leans back in his chair pondering

DOC
Do you have a map of the area where
they landed

Campalong has a large one on his desk Doc gets up to have a
look and the FBI agent outside the door makes a move to re-
enter Campalong holds up his hand and the agent sits back
down

CAMPALONG
Jesus who does he think you are

Doc scrutinizes the map Then it occurs to him

DOC
Surveyor

CAMPALONG
What
DOC
Surveyor Six
CAMPALONG
The old robotic lander
DOC
They’re close
(to himself)

Cole Why would you head to
Surveyor Think Think

(to Campalong)
If they lost fuel in the crash-
landing but the engine was still
intact where would they find fuel
Surveyor Six would definitely have
some left in its tanks but very
little It doesn’t make sense

CAMPALONG
Whoah doctor Slow down What
doesn’t make sense

DOC
Why would they go to Surveyor Six
It’s less likely to have as much
and it’s further away

CAMPALONG
Than what

DOC
Than Apollo 14 They’re only about
thirty miles away from the Apollo
14 landing site verses eighty for
Surveyor So why wouldn’t they head
there first It doesn’t make sense

CAMPALONG
Who would know this stuff

DOC
Cole Nealson would Cole and only
- well me But mostly Cole He’s
in his element up there

Doc sits back down thinking hard Then he smiles

DOC
Of course He’s going to both
Surveyor is further away so he
sent the rover there he’s going to
Apollo on foot Is there any way we
can communicate with them

Campalong’s eyes light up He hops up and gestures for Doc to
follow him They both head out the door The FBI agent who
has dozed off is startled awake as they pass He sits for a
second getting his bearings and then lowers himself back in
the chair

DOC

Cole walks down the length of the hab out of Sergei’s view
In two long strides he reaches the LEM and climbs inside

that a very large rocket was
launched seven days ago from a
former Soviet ICBM silo just

American missile defense forces
tracked a space craft into Earth
orbit and then continued tracking
as it left on a trajectory to the

the vessel which we believe
contained several wanted
international criminals and
offered assistance but the offer
was rejected According to our
tracking devices in Houston and

Maybe they were doing us a favor
The noble thing electing to
sacrifice themselves for the

stacking empty red cylinders out by the H3 mining equipment
Sergei removes the one attached to the miner and begins
carrying it to the LEM Saburo waves He notices the rover
and bounds over to Sergei

Did Colonel Simon find the fuel

Sergei doesn’t answer He climbs into the LEM with the
cylinder and closes the door behind him Sergei catches a
glimpse of Hack standing behind the controls The door stays
shut Systems that had been shut down on the LEM are stirring
back to life Saburo steps back He surmises that Hack and
Sergei are about to launch a hunch that is confirmed over
his headset

Stand clear Saburo

The monk bounds over to the heap of debris from the lander
and retrieves the long wire Cole used for the pulley He
wraps it around his waist and then bounds over to the LEM
and hooks the wire on a metal support bar on its underside
He is now tied to the LEM a human anchor and begins banging
on the underside

Tied himself

Hack leaves the controls to see for himself He sees Saburo
standing arms crossed smiling and leaps down to the lunar
soil

Hack moves swiftly to Saburo and without a word yanks out the
lifeline of his spacesuit Saburo looks stunned and then
violently the oxygen is sucked out of his lungs It is as
though he had just been hit by a car Then blood and fluids
spurt from his nostrils mouth eyes and ears sweat shoots
from every pore and his face turns beet red The vacuum has
sucked the fluids and gases from his body and he is now
cooking alive He keels over backwards

HACK
Untether that and get back in

and cuts the wire He eases around Saburo’s cooking body now
black and shriveling He backs into the LEM steps and
hurries back aboard The hatch closes

nothing He turns the switch back off and tries it again

out again to the lunar surface Inside his suit Saburo is
already shriveled and blackened Hack steps under the LEM and
inspects the engine Nothing Sergei joins him Reaching for
his tools he disassembles the housing at the top of the
engine It is all normal

They stagger to their feet Cole jumps down to a ledge and
reaches back to help Anya who jumps but in her weakness
stumbles She falls past Cole and tumbles a great distance
down the steep hill Cole is devastated Anya is way down
below now on her hands and knees Cole rushes down the slope
toward her frantically thinking she’s hurt but she is
just staring at the ground inspecting a golf ball

occasionally picking up their tracks which when they find
them are still clear in the lunar dust The smallest bump

small drop-off and just guns the rover over it He and Anya
hang on with both hands and nearly are thrown from their

flashes The kick sends him crashing backwards into Sergei

Cole is standing at the control panel strapped into the
harness alone Outside the triangular window the hab is
glowing softly with light the line of darkness and cold has
fallen over it Between the LEM still in sunlight and the
hab is a spectacular sparkling cloud of charged particles

COLE
It’s a long story

DOC (0S)
So Anya was the only one left to
stay behind That’s exactly what
she would do

KEANE (0S)

Okay Cole ol’ buddy We’re going
to begin the countdown Do a final
systems check with me will you

EXT MOON

From over the crater rim climbs Hack dragging the broken
leg His helmet is cracked and his face is contorted with
pain and red and blistered from the heat The integrity of
his suit has been breached so he slowly roasting inside it
wheezing at too-thin air that flees his helmet almost as
rapidly as it is pumped in In one gloved had he holds the
Glock

INT HAB

Anya sits in the half light her face in her hands sobbing

INT LEM
Cole is flipping switches

KEANE (0S)
Five four three two one igni --

Cole flips the ignition switch and the LEM interior roars
with the sound of the ascent engine springing to life

COLE
Lift off

Just as the craft begins to lift off Cole leans forward for
a last look at the glowing hab and sees Hack moving toward
it He reaches for the abort switch

COLE
Abort

KEANE (0S)
Dude don’t

Cole flips the switch

EXT MOON CAMP

The LEM is about six feet off the ground on a ball of flame
The force of the launch has blown Hack off his feet and he
lands hard twenty feet back up the slope The flame abruptly
shuts down and the LEM falls as if in slow motion back
into the makeshift launch platform where it comes to rest

INT HAB

Anya feels the vibration from the rocket engine stop too
soon She stands alarmed She begins rapidly pulling on her
spacesuit

EXT MOON CAMP

Hack picks himself back up His face looks like it is being
slowly boiled blood is coming from his nose and mouth and
ears He starts forward again

The hatch of the LEM opens and Cole climbs out He closes
the space between him and Hack rapidly throwing himself at
him They both fall and roll away from each other

Hack stands levels the Glock at Cole and fires but his arm
is so unsteady the shot misses and the kick knocks him off
his feet and sends him flying backwards Cole is on him and
they grapple rolling Hack reaches around Cole’s suit and
his gloved hand closes over the 02 line on his back but
before he can pull it his hand opens suddenly

Standing over them both is Anya The blue handle of her knife
projects from Hack’s shoulder The violent depressurization
of his suit has knocked him cold She is already holding the
bloody fabric together gripping it tightly

ANYA
Help me with him

They drag Hack into the abruptly subzero darkness Anya opens
the hatch to the hab and they pull Hack inside and close the
hatch behind them staggered and shivering with the cold

ANYA
Why did you abort

COLE
I saw him with the gun I had to

When the pressure chamber is full they open the inner hatch
and pull him into the hab Anya tears open his suit and
reaches for his vital signs

COLE
Is he alive

Anya nods She wraps a bandage around his arm to stop the
bleeding and injects him with morphine

ANYA
That’11 knock him out for a while

COLE
He’1l make it right

COLE (0S)

Simon our commander is not
deceased as previously reported

well-known dedication to the
mission and the age-old duties of
command has volunteered to remain

flame and then rockets up and away into the blackness

INT SOYUZ CAPSULE -- ONE DAY LATER

Naked and weightless Cole’s hands and feet are locked into
cloth strip holds and Anya also naked clings to him her
arms and legs wrapped around him Iron and Wine plays “Our
Endless Numbered Days” Her hair floats in a wild cloud Her
blue handled knife floats in mid-cabin One of the earplugs
from Anya’s i-Pod is in Cole’s ear the other is in her’s
The camera swims around them as they make love in a place
where there is literally no up or down no point of reference
except each other

COLE
I guess this makes us charter
members of the one hundred thousand
mile high club

These are serious charges but in
light of the circumstances
obviously they are under review We
understand that Mr Nealson and
Miss Poloniev have become
international folk heroes but if
they return safely they will have
to answer for the theft of the LEM
from the Air Space Museum and
various other crimes related to
this stunt

How long can he be expected to hold
out alone on the Moon

CAMPALONG
Indefinitely The habitat was
designed on a contract by NASA by
Cole Nealson and is apparently
functioning well Colonel Simon has
ample food water and oxygen His
presence on the Moon has
accelerated plans for us to return
there We may be talking within a
year or two

REPORTER TWO
When and where do you anticipate
the Soyuz will splash down

CAMPALONG
For safety reasons we are bringing
them right down We are estimating -

He turns to Keane who steps up to the microphones
KEANE
In the Atlantic just east of New
York City and about 11 AM tomorrow
