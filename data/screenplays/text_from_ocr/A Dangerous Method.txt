WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 1

INT CARRIAGE - DAY

A violent struggle is in progress CLOSE on a mans thick
fleshy hand as it grips the two slender wrists of a young
girl whos trying desperately to free herself grunting
with effort

A WIDER ANGLE shows us that there are three people in the
carriage the third a man in uniform on his knees in a corner
hanging on to the girls feet and lower legs as she jerks

and flails like a landed fish The GIRL is SABINA SPIELREIN

a dark slight young woman of 19 olive-skinned and beautiful
with waist-length dark hair The MAN gripping her wrists in
her father NIKOLAI SPIELREIN a large coarse-looking red-
faced Russian in his midforties with a thick moustache

Abruptly SABINA stops struggling but the relief palpable
on the faces of the two men is short-lived for SABINA begins
to wail terrible broken-hearted sobs to freeze the blood

EXT LAKESIDE ROAD —- DAY

A bright summer day pours sunlight on the COACHMAN as he
lashes the horses on up a hill leading away from the large
expanse of the lake

A CAPTION ZURICH SWITZERLAND 17TH AUGUST 1904
EXT BURGHOLZLI - DAY

The Burghédlzli hospital is a massive plain building on the
crest of a hill The COACHMAN jumps down to open the door
and help the ORDERLY and NIKOLAI SPIELREIN as they emerge
seen from ABOVE carrying the writhing body of SABINA

INT RECEPTION AREA —- DAY

As the MEN labour in with the struggling SABINA she suddenly
goes limp and begins shrieking with laughter

Two or three NURSES close in on her as the ORDERLY drops her
legs while other NURSES arrive down various corridors
attracted by the noise SABINA stops laughing and sticks

her tongue out as far as it will go at the approaching NURSES
causing SPIELREIN to smack her round the head at which the
hysterical laughter begins again
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 2

CLOSE on SABINA screaming with laughter until suddenly
her eyes flick upwards and she stops again in the middle of
a peal of laughter shes seen something

Descending the main staircase is DR CARL GUSTAV JUNG a
tall broad-shouldered godlike young man of 29 haloed in a
backlit glow and smiling faintly as he purposefully
approaches

SABINA is still now staring up at the apparition
INT CONSULTING ROOM - DAY

SABINA sits bolt upright on a straight-backed chair in the
dead centre of a bare white room Shes wearing a simple
dress and her hair has been braided into one long plait
Theres another chair placed about five or six feet behind
her slightly to one side JUNG breezes into the room

JUNG
Good morning Im Dr Jung I admitted
you last night

He stretches out a hand but she wont take it This doesnt
seem to discourage him in the least

JUNG (CONTD)
How did you sleep

SABINA
They wouldnt let me keep the light
on

JUNG

You like to sleep with the light on

SABINA
I

Her mouth stays open she seems to be making an enormous
unsuccessful effort to speak

JUNG
I think we can allow that

SABINA closes her mouth relief in her eyes

SABINA
Im not mad you know
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 3

JUNG
Let me explain what I have in mind
I propose that we meet here most
days to talk for an hour or two

SABINA
Talk

JUNG
Yes Just talk See if we can
identify whats troubling you So
as to distract you as little as
possible I shall sit there behind
you and Im going to ask you to try
not to turn round and look at me
under any circumstances

He moves behind her and sits in the second chair Her face
twitches her expression is apprehensive JUNG opens a small
notebook on his knee in which he will make regular notes

JUNG (CONTD)
Now Have you any idea what may
have brought on these attacks you
suffer from

SABINA has to struggle for some time before she can answer

SABINA
Humiliation

Silence JUNG waits SABINAS head jerks back in a series of
involuntary tics

SABINA (CONTD)
Any kind of humiliation I cant
bear to see it Makes me feel
nauseated I start pouring with sweat
cold sweat

JUNG
No one likes to see that kind of
thing But these must have been
isolated incidents

Silence SABINA is in obvious distress

JUNG (CONTD)
Were they not
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 4

SABINA
No often they were often happened
often

JUNG
At home

SABINA

My father lost his temper all the
time he was always angry with my

brothers

JUNG
With your brothers

SABINA
Mmm

JUNG

Not with you

SABINA
Sometimes ah sometimes

JUNG
What would he do

SABINA
Shout and shout And hit them

Shes writhing in her chair now her leg twitching her face
out of control

JUNG
But you do love your father

SABINA
Ah yes but I couldnt I
couldnt he was so sad sometimes
and I wasnt able to pride it
was the most painful kind of love
I couldnt even couldnt kiss
him

She breaks off JUNG waits a while
JUNG

When you stopped talking just now
did a thought come into your head

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 5

SABINA
I dont ah
JUNG
Or an image perhaps Was it an image
SABINA
Yes
JUNG

What was the image

SABINA
A hand

She writhes in her chair finally she comes to rest and
speaks only just audibly

SABINA (CONTD)
My fathers hand

JUNG
Why do you think you saw that

SABINA
After he whenever he hit us
afterwards we had to kiss his
hand

She twists and turns JUNG writes in his notebook
INT JUNGS APARTMENT - DAY

The apartment assigned to the hospitals assistant director

is a set of plain rooms on the second floor of the hospital
comfortably furnished by JUNGs wife EMMA a fair attractive
22-year-old now five months pregnant

JUNG has finished his breakfast and sips his coffee as EMMA
moves around clearing the table

JUNG
Whats odd is that case I was writing
up last week I happened to pick the
codename Sabina S And here she is
Sabina Spielrein
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

EMMA
Quite a coincidence

JUNG
As you know I dont believe there
is such a thing

EMMA puts his empty cup on the tray

EMMA
Spielreins not a very Russian name

JUNG
No Jewish Fathers a very successful
import-export man And shes
exceptionally well educated speaks
fluent German Aspires to be a doctor
herself apparently

EMMA
Perhaps shes the one
JUNG
What one
EMMA

The one youve been looking for
For your experimental treatment
The talking cure

JUNG
(smiles )
Youre so astute Ive already begun
it with her
EMMA lays a hand on her stomach

EMMA
Hes kicking can you feel

JUNG rests a hand on her stomach

JUNG
Oh yes There he is

He starts to put on his jacket and straightens his
preparing to leave

tie

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 7

JUNG (CONTD)
What I dont understand is why Freud
having proposed this radical
therapeutic idea this talking cure
this psychanalysis then lets years
go by without giving even the barest
outline of his clinical procedures
Whats he playing at

EMMA
Presumably he uses the method on his
patients

JUNG

Ive no idea

EMMA
So might you be the first doctor to
try this out

JUNG
Its possible

EMMA
Why dont you write and ask him

JUNG
I dont know him As it happens
Miss Spielreins mother wanted to
take her to see Freud

EMMA
Another coincidence

Her tone is teasing JUNG shakes his head pecks her
affectionately on the cheek and heads for the door

EXT PINEWOODS - DAY

JUNG and SABINA stroll through the towering pines which cover
the slopes of a hill near the Burghélzli Theyre wearing
overcoats SABINAs worn draped across her shoulders SABINA
seems more relaxed JUNG carries a stout walking-stick

SABINA
My father thinks my mother doesnt
love him and hes right she

doesnt
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

JUNG
How do you know
SABINA
My angel told me
JUNG
What angel
SABINA

An inner voice He used to tell me I
was an exceptional person For some
reason he always spoke in German

JUNG
Angels always speak German its
traditional

SABINA smiles perhaps for the first time

SABINA
He gave me the power to know what
people are going to say before they
open their mouths

JUNG
Useful ability for a doctor You
hope to be a doctor someday dont
you

SABINA
Ill never be a doctor

JUNG
Why not

SABINA looks up at him gratefully they walk on for a while
in silence

JUNG (CONTD)
I have to go away for a while Im
sorry Weve just gotten started

SABINA looks up at him shocked
JUNG (CONTD)

Military service We all have to do
it Just for a couple of weeks
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

SABINA starts trembling her expression darkens

SABINA
Its all a waste of time I cant
tell you whatever it is you want to
know youre just making me angry
and if I did tell you youd be sorry

you ever anyway theres nothing
wrong with me I dont even want to
get better

She instinctively pulls away from him her coat catches on a
branch and is swept off onto the dusty ground JUNG picks it
up holds it out and starts to beat the dust out of it with

his stick Suddenly SABINA hurls herself at him and snatches

the coat out of his hand

SABINA (CONTD)
Stop it

JUNG
I was only

SABINA
Will you stop that

JUNG
Im sorry

SABINA looks at him for a moment her expression fearful
then she looks away and speaks abruptly

SABINA
Can we go back now

JUNG
Yes if you want to

SABINA
I need to get back

INT JUNGS APARTMENT - DAY

JUNG folds his army uniform and closes his suitcase EMMA
hovers sympathetically in the background

JUNG
Its a complete waste of my time
(MORE )
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 10

JUNG (CONTD)
Writing prescriptions for athletes

to night

EMMA

JUNG
Its not good for me and its not
good for my patients

9 INT SABINAS ROOM - DAY

SABINAs lunch is untouched and shes busying herself with
holding her napkin over a candle-flame burning tiny holes
in it An older NURSE comes in sees what SABINA is doing

takes the
tray

The NURSE

napkin gently from her and turns to look at her

NURSE
You havent eaten your lunch

SABINA
Not hungry

leans in to collect the tray then checks herself

NURSE
Wheres the knife

SABINA
Nobody eats on Mars

NURSE
Is that so Now where have you put
the knife

SABINA
I might need it

NURSE
I shall have to tell Professor
Bleuler

SABINA
Do what you like

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

PROFESSOR EUGEN BLEULER the director of the Burghdlzli a
diminutive but distinguished-looking white-bearded
gentleman follows the NURSE to the door of SABINAs room

INT SABINAS ROOM - DAY

The room is empty However a piece of paper is pinned to
the wall by a knife The NURSE crosses to investigate

BLEULER
What does it say

NURSE
If Im not back tomorrow it doesnt
necessarily mean Im dead

BLEULER sighs shaking his head dispiritedly
EXT HOSPITAL GROUNDS - DAY

Its raining BLEULER and the NURSE come upon a small knot
of struggling ORDERLIES at the centre of which is SABINA
her face and arms smeared with wet mud Shes grappling
fruitlessly with the largest ORDERLY but stops as soon as
BLEULER appears

SABINA
Ah The Herr Direktor

BLEULERs manner is entirely calm

BLEULER
Miss Spielrein I feel you may have
a little too much time on your hands
Im a great believer in getting our
patients involved in some productive
work What are your particular
interests

SABINA
Suicide Interplanetary travel

BLEULER turns not rising to this
BLEULER

Shall we go in
(MORE )

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 12

BLEULER (CONTD)
When Dr Jung returns I shall ask
him to discuss all this with you in
more detail

SABINA
No Keep him away from me I never
want to see him again

By now shes allowing the ORDERLIES to begin leading her
back towards the hospital laughing loudly

INT HOSPITAL BATHROOM - DAY

Theres a strange-looking contraption in the middle of the
room a dark wooden bath with metal attachments two-thirds
full of water Next to it SABINA is grappling with three
NURSES kicking and shouting

Eventually they manage to get her undressed and into the
bath whereupon something rather like a coffin-lid leaving
only SABINAs head free is banged across the top of the

bath and secured SABINA begins to wail as one of the NURSES

starts to wash the mud off her face
INT SABINAS ROOM - DAY

SABINA lies on her bed the picture of apathy JUNG steps
into the room radiating energy

JUNG
Hello Im back
(pause)
How have you been

SABINA doesnt answer she turns her face to the wall

JUNG (CONTD)
Ive been talking to the Herr Direktor
about finding some work for you I
told him youd always been interested
in medicine He suggested you might
like to assist me occasionally in my
research

SABINAs face lights up

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 13

JUNG (CONTD)
Were quite short-staffed so it
would certainly be a help to me

INT LABORATORY BURGHOLZLI - DAY

EMMA JUNG noticeably more pregnant sits in a straightbacked
chair hooked up to an electro-galvanometer JUNG holding a
clipboard sits at an angle so that he can monitor the
galvanometer and SABINA in a white lab coat sits off to
one side with a stopwatch and a notebook

The galvanometer reacts wildly SABINA watches the ticking

JUNG relaxes with a warm smile and disconnects EMMA from the

machine

JUNG
Thank you

EMMA
Is that all

JUNG
Thats all

EMMA

How did I do

JUNG
Beautifully

Slightly surprised still EMMA heaves herself to her feet
She crosses to the door glancing at SABINA en route

JUNG (CONTD)
Goodbye

EMMA
Erm yes goodbye

She leaves the room JUNG turns to SABINA

JUNG
Any preliminary observations

SABINA
Obviously whats uppermost in her
mind is her pregnancy

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

JUNG
Good

SABINA
Shes a little whats the word

JUNG
Why dont we try a useful word
invented by our Herr Direktor
ambivalent

SABINA
Yes about the baby

JUNG
Anything else

SABINA
Id say she was worried her husband
might be losing interest in her

JUNG
What makes you think that

SABINA
Long reaction times to the words
‘family and divorce

JUNG
I see

SABINA
When you said cap she said wear
Might that be a reference to
contraception

JUNG smiles impressed

JUNG
Youve quite a flair for this

SABINA
Can I ask you something

JUNG
Of course

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 17 15

SABINA
Is she your wife

At first taken aback JUNG recovers quickly and nods smiling
INT JUNGS APARTMENT - DAY 16

JUNG steps into the room where EMMA is nursing her new-born
baby She looks up at him her expression defensive

EMMA
Im sorry

JUNG
Sorry

EMMA

I promised you a son on Christmas
Day And here she is a day late and
the wrong sex

JUNG
Dont be absurd

He leans forward caressing the babys forehead with his
great hand

JUNG (CONTD)
A for Agathe

EMMA
Next time Ill give you a boy

INT CONSULTING ROOM - DAY 17

JUNG and SABINA in their customary positions judging by the
grimace JUNG makes as he uncrosses his legs theyve been
there for some time Eventually SABINA breaks the silence

SABINA
Can we stop now

JUNG
Id like to go on a little longer

SABINA
But its been I mean how long
has it been
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

JUNG
Weve been talking for about two and
a half hours

SABINA
Then why cant we

JUNG
Its my belief that theres one more
step to be taken and as this is our
first session of the New Year I
have a sense that progress is
possible

SABINA
I dont know what to tell you

JUNG waits for a moment before speaking
JUNG

Can you explain why your nights have
been so bad

SABINA
Im afraid

JUNG
Of what

SABINA

Theres something in the room
something like a cat only it
can speak it gets into bed with me

Long silence JUNG waits

SABINA (CONTD)
Last last night it suddenly
whispered something in my ear I
couldnt hear what but then
I felt it behind me it put its
hand on my waist and then

Shes twisting furiously in the chair in an agony of
discomfort
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10
17 SABINA (CONTD)
I felt something against my back
something slimy like some kind of
a mollusc moving against my
back but when I turned round there
was nothing there

JUNG
You felt it against your back
SABINA
Yes
JUNG
Were you naked
SABINA
I was
JUNG

Were you masturbating

SABINA
Yes

Another long silence JUNG seems about to break it when
SABINA speaks again

SABINA (CONTD)
I loathe New Years

JUNG sits up suddenly alert

JUNG
Why

SABINA
For example last New Years Day
he flew into a terrible rage nobody
could understand why and he took my
brother Isaac and and

A tremendous barrage of tics overwhelms her for a moment
SABINA (CONTD)

---beat him in front of everyone
and I I

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 She cant go on

JUNG
Weve talked a lot about these
outbursts of your fathers There
were times werent there when he
did beat you

SABINA
Oh yes often he often

JUNG
Tell me about those

SABINAs eyes dart from place to place she looks trapped
and panicky

SABINA
Can we stop now

JUNG
Id like to go on just a little
longer

SABINA
So ah

Shes struggling to control herself

SABINA (CONTD)
What was the question

JUNG
Tell me about the first time you can
remember being beaten by your father

SABINA looks as if shes contemplating running out of the
room Finally she manages to speak

SABINA
I suppose I was about four I broke
a plate or yes and he told
me to go in the little room and
take my clothes off then he came
in and spanked me I was so
frightened I wet myself so he
hit me again and

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 21

JUNG

And after that first time he beat
you a lot

SABINA
Oh yes yes and when he was
away my mother beat me but that
wasnt at all it wasnt the same

aS
Tears are starting to roll down her cheeks
JUNG
That first time how did you feel
about what was happening

Long silence after which SABINAs reply is scarcely audible

SABINA
I liked it

JUNG
Would you repeat that please I
couldnt quite hear

SABINA
I liked it It excited me

JUNG
And did you continue to like it

SABINA gives a long groan

SABINA
Yes yes before long he only
had to say to me to go to the
little room and I would start to
get wet

JUNG
Did you sometimes provoke him
deliberately

SABINA

No I it happened often enough

She breaks off JUNG waits

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 22 17

SABINA (CONTD)
Whenever he beat one of my brothers -
or even just threatened that was
enough Id have to go and lie
down and touch myself later at
school anything would set it off
any kind of humiliation I looked
for any humiliation even here
when you hit my coat with your stick
I had to come back right away I
was so excited

A torrent of sobbing slowly plays itself out then shes
still at last and her voice is quiet

SABINA (CONTD)

Theres no hope for me Im vile and

filthy and corrupt I must never be

let out of here
Her head sinks

SLOW FADE TO BLACK

EXT 19 BERGGASSE STREET VIENNA - DAY 18
JUNG and EMMA descend from a taxi outside No19 Berggasse
a quiet street in Vienna 9 As JUNG pays the taxi and turns
towards the house the front door opens to reveal a slight
bearded man of medium height conservatively dressed in frock
coat and stiff collar this is PROFESSOR SIGMUND FREUD at

A CAPTION TWO YEARS LATER VIENNA AUSTRIA 3RD MARCH
FREUD steps forward to shake hands warmly with JUNG

JUNG
Professor Freud

FREUD
So good to meet you at long last

He shakes hands with EMMA with a courtly little bow

FREUD (CONTD)
Youre most welcome

He turns to lead them into the house

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 23

INT DINING ROOM FREUDS APARTMENT - DAY

There are eleven people at lunch in the slightly cramped
conditions of the FREUD family dining-room in addition to
FREUD JUNG and EMMA are FREUDs wife MARTHA his sister-in-
law MINNA BERNAYS and his six children ranging in age
from MATHILDE 19 to ANNA 11 FREUD sits next to JUNG at
one end of the table while EMMA sits at the far end with
the two adult women A MAID squeezes around the outside of
the table offering food

JUNG

Perhaps the terms themselves should
be reviewed if for instance we
could come up with some milder term
than libido we might not encounter
such emotional resistance it would
make the teaching side of things

much easier

He breaks off obliged to move his chair so that the MAID
can pass and offer him food He helps himself
unselfconsciously to an enormous quantity

FREUD
Is euphemism a good idea Once they
work out what we actually mean
theyll be just as appalled as ever

He cant help frowning as he takes note of the vast quantity
of food on JUNGs plate

JUNG
I take your point but I still think
its worth trying to sweeten the
pill when it comes to questions of
sexuality

FREUD
And by the way please dont feel
you have to restrain yourself here
My family are all veterans of the
most unsuitable topics of mealtime
conversation

JUNG glances around for a second slightly nonplussed since
its never occurred to him to take the mixed company into
consideration Then he plunges on

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 24

JUNG
I have a number of clinical examples
which I believe support my position
with regard to sexuality

INT FREUDS STUDY - DAY

CLOSE on FREUDs cigar as he lights and puffs at it
releasing thick smoke into the homely atmosphere of his
cluttered study furnished in late-Victorian style with
Turkey rugs a scattering of family photographs a mass of
classical etchings and drawings on the walls and innumerable
decorative objects mostly small archaeological pieces
covering every surface Floor to ceiling bookshelves cover
two walls

FREUD
And how is your little Russian
patient

JUNG

As I told you after the initial
abreaction there was the most
dramatic improvement Weve enrolled
her in the medical school at the
University where shes doing
extremely well Shes a walking
advertisement for the effectiveness
of psychanalysis

FREUD
Psychoanalysis

JUNG
Oh

FREUD
Its more logical and it sounds
better

JUNG

If you say so

FREUD
Are you still treating her

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 25

JUNG
Yes and we continue to unearth new
material for example the
extraordinary procedure she devised
as a small child where she would
sit on one heel attempt to defecate
and at the same time try to prevent
herself from defecating She said
this gave rise to the most blissful
feelings

FREUD
A nice story Those of my patients
who remain fixated at the anal stage
of their erotic development often
come up with the most amusing details
And of course all of them are finicky
compulsively tidy stubborn and
extremely stingy with money No doubt
your Russian conforms to this pattern

JUNG
Well no she doesnt

FREUD frowns he puffs at his cigar evidently somewhat put
out

JUNG (CONTD)
The masochistic aspects of her
condition are much more deeply rooted
than any anal fixations we may have
uncovered

FREUD
But the two are intimately connected

JUNG
I can only tell you shes rather
disorganised emotionally generous
and exceptionally idealistic

FREUD
Well perhaps its a Russian thing

He looks across at JUNG eyes narrowed

FREUD (CONTD)
Is she a virgin

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 26

JUNG
Yes certainly Almost certainly
No certainly

His slight confusion is not lost on FREUD who sucks on his
cigar his good mood quite restored

INT CAFE SPERL VIENNA - DAY

JUNG fork in hand is tucking into an enormous slab of
Sachertorte accompanied by a large cup of coffee piled high
with whipped cream

FREUD a chaste cup of black coffee in front of him watches
him benevolently Behind the coffee house is thronged with
men deep in animated conversation reading newspapers from
the racks or playing chess

FREUD
I dont think you have any notion of
the true strengths and depths of the
opposition to our work Theres the
whole medical establishment of
course baying to send Freud to the
auto-da-fé but thats as nothing
compared to what happens when our
ideas begin to trickle through in
whatever garbled form theyre relayed
to the public the denials the
frenzy the incoherent rage you
wouldnt believe it

JUNG
But might that not be caused by your
insistence on the exclusively sexual
interpretation of the clinical
material

FREUD
All Im doing is pointing out what
experience indicates to me must be
the truth And I can assure you
that in a hundred years time our
work will still be rejected
Columbus you know had no idea what
county hed discovered like him
Im in the dark all I know is that
Ive set foot on the shore and the
country exists

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 27

JUNG
I think of you more as Galileo and
your opponents as those who condemned
him while refusing even to put their
eye to his telescope

FREUD
In any event Ive simply opened a
door its for the young men like
yourself to walk through it

JUNG
Im sure you have many more doors to
open for us

FREUD
At your age I had made no mark at
all whereas you for example have
invented the indispensable word
‘complex

JUNG
I hope to be remembered for more
than just a single word

FREUD
And Ive no doubt you will be

He stubs out his cigar and drains his coffee looking intently
across at JUNG

FREUD (CONTD)
Of course theres the added
difficulty more ammunition for our
enemies that all of us here in
Vienna in our psychoanalytical
circle are Jews

JUNG
I dont see what difference that
makes

FREUD looks at him hes staring innocently across his
moustache thick with white cream

FREUD
That if I may say so is an
exquisitely Protestant remark

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 28

INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT

Its deep into the night but FREUD and JUNGs conversation
is still in full flow

JUNG
I dreamed about a horse being hoisted
by cables to a considerable height
Suddenly a cable breaks and the
horse is dashed to the ground But
its not hurt it leaps up and gallops
away impeded only by a heavy log
which its obliged to drag along the
ground Then a rider on a small
horse appears in front of it so
that its forced to slow down and a
carriage appears in front of the
small horse so that our horse is
compelled to slow down even more

FREUD considers for a moment

FREUD

I imagine the horse is yourself
JUNG

Yes
FREUD

Your ambition has been frustrated in
some way hence the fall

JUNG

The rider slowing me down
FREUD

Yes
JUNG

I think this may refer to my wifes
first pregnancy I had to give up an
opportunity to go to America because
of it

FREUD
Ah America Youre right Im sure
thats a most important territory
for us

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

JUNG
The carriage in front perhaps refers
to an apprehension that our two
daughters and other children perhaps
still to come will impede my progress
even more

FREUD
As a father of six I can vouch for
that not to mention the inevitable
financial difficulties

JUNG
No Fortunately my wife is extremely
rich

FREUD takes a moment to recover from this

FREUD
Ah Yes that is fortunate

He forces himself to return to the matter in hand

FREUD (CONTD)
This log

JUNG
Yes

FREUD
I think perhaps you should entertain
the possibility that it represents
the penis

JUNG
Yes in which case what may be at
issue is that a certain sexual
constraint has been brought about by
a fear of an endless succession of
pregnancies

As FREUD answers JUNG begins the elaborate process of
lighting his pipe

FREUD
Hm

FREUD (CONTD)
Im bound to say if one of my patients
had brought me this dream I might
have said that the number of
restraining elements surrounding
this unfortunate horse could perhaps
point to the determined suppression
of some unruly sexual desire

JUNG
Yes

He sucks his pipe for a while

JUNG (CONTD)
There is that as well

FREUD permits himself a satisfied smile the clock on his
desk shows its coming up to 2 am

FREUD
I wonder if youre aware of the fact
that our conversation has so far
lasted thirteen hours

JUNG
Im sorry I had no idea

FREUD
My dear young colleague please dont
apologise It was our first meeting
we had a great deal to say to one
another and unless Im much mistaken
we always will

JUNG nods solemnly
EXT APPROACHES TO THE FERRY STATION ZURICH - DAY

JUNG and SABINA make their way down the hill towards the
lake deep in conversation

JUNG
Ive never met anyone like him
Nothing passes him by He understands
everything I suppose hes whats
meant by a great man I shall have
to be extremely careful

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

SABINA
What do you mean Why

JUNG
Hes so persuasive hes so
convincing he makes you feel you
should abandon your own ideas and
simply follow in his wake His
followers in Vienna are all deeply
unimpressive a crowd of Bohemians
and degenerates just picking up the
crumbs from his table

SABINA
Perhaps hes reached the stage where
obedience is more important to him
than originality

JUNG
Mm I tried to tackle him about his
obsession with sexuality his
insistence on interpreting every
symptom in sexual terms but hes
completely inflexible

SABINA
In my case of course hed have
been right

JUNG

Yes as you would expect him to be
in many cases Possibly even the
majority of cases

He shakes his head troubled as they approach the ferry

station
JUNG (CONTD)
But there must be more than one hinge
into the universe
24 EXT FERRY LAKE ZURICH - DAY

JUNG stands leaning over the handrail looking out across
the lake Hes momentarily taken aback by a question from
SABINA

SABINA
Do you like Wagner

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

They both

JUNG
The music and the man yes

SABINA
Im very interested in the myth of
Siegfried the idea that something
pure and heroic can come can perhaps
only come from a sin even a sin as
dark as incest

JUNG
This is very strange

SABINA
What

JUNG

Ive told you before I dont believe
in coincidence I believe nothing
happens by accident all these things
have a significance the fact is

Im in the middle of writing something
myself about the Siegfried myth

look at each other for a moment

SABINA
Are you really

JUNG
I assure you

SABINA
Which is your favourite of the operas

JUNG
Das Rheingold

SABINA
Yes Thats right Me too

Her eyes are shining with excitement

JUNG
Perhaps we might go to the opera
sometimes My wife has never been
interested

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 33 24

SABINA
Id love to

She looks up at him hesitant then decides to take the
plunge

SABINA (CONTD)
Can I ask you something

JUNG
Of course

SABINA
Do you think theres any possibility
I could ever be a psychiatrist

JUNG contemplates her eager expression

JUNG
I know you could I hear nothing but
good reports on your work at the
University Youre exactly the kind
of person we need

SABINA
Insane you mean

JUNG frowns then he realises shes joking and his expression
lightens

JUNG
Yes we sane doctors have serious
limitations

INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT 25

FREUD at his desk pen in hand poised above a sheet of white
notepaper with PROF DR FREUD modestly printed in the top
left corner He writes the date 170208 in large spidery
handwriting

FREUD (VO)
Dear friend I feel I can at last
permit myself this informal mode of
address as I ask you to grant me a
very particular favour

EXT BURGHOLZLI - DAY

A tall thin bearded man with piercing blue eyes wearing a
fraying but elegant suit pauses to look up at the cheerless
fagade of the hospital This is OTTO GROSS

Hes thirty

FREUD (VO)
Dr Otto Gross a most brilliant
but erratic character is urgently
in need of your medical help I
consider him apart from yourself
the only man capable of making a
major contribution to our field

GROSS reaches into his waistcoat pocket and brings out a
pinch of white powder which he carelessly inhales

FREUD (CONTD)
Whatever you do dont let him out
before October when I shall be able
to take him over from you And
remember his fathers warning made
when Otto was only a very small child
watch out for him he bites

GROSS blinks shakes his head to clear it and reluctantly
advances through the hospital entrance

INT JUNGS OFFICE - DAY
GROSS is smoking his feet stretched out in front of him

slumped comfortably in his chair JUNG on the other hand
behind his desk looks somewhat constrained and anxious

JUNG
You still feel threatened by your
father

GROSS

Anyone with any sense feels threatened

by my father Hes extremely

threatening To you of course

hes an eminent criminologist the

man who virtually invented a whole

new science footprints fingerprints

bloodstains semen samples but to
(MORE )

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 35

GROSS (CONTD)
me hes a man with a very simple
aim to put every single person he
disapproves of in jail You dont
have to be a criminal in fact he
wrote a pamphlet explaining that
anarchists tramps homosexuals
gypsies and perverts - people like
me - were far more dangerous than
honest criminals and should be
deported to South-West Africa So
in my view if you didnt feel
threatened by my father youd need
your head examined

JUNG
His wish to have you hospitalised
you dont think that arises from a
concern for your welfare

GROSS
Listen what does any normal old
patriach want in the twilight of his
life Grandchildren grandsons am I
right And yet last summer when I
presented him with not one but two
little Grosses one by my wife one
by one of most respectable mistresses
and we called them both Peter so he
wouldnt get confused was he
grateful And now theres another
on the way admittedly by some woman
I hardly know hes apoplectic and
all he can think is to get me banged
away in some institution You got
any children

JUNG
Two girls

GROSS
Same mother

JUNG
Yes

GROSS

Ah

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 36

Pause JUNG fiddles with his pipe

JUNG
So youre not a believer in monogamy

GROSS
For a neurotic like myself I cant
possibly imagine a more stressful
concept

JUNG
And you dont find it necessary or
desirable to exercise some restraint
as a contribution say to the smooth
functioning of civilisation

GROSS
What and make myself ill

JUNG
I should have thought that some form
of sexual repression would have to
be practised in any rational society

GROSS
No wonder the hospitals are bulging
at the seams

He reaches into a waistcoat pocket fetches something out
and pops it in his mouth

GROSS (CONTD)
Are you going to help me cut down on
this stuff

JUNG
Ill do my best

GROSS
Good because its doing my head in

He leans forward his manner suddenly conspiratorial

GROSS (CONTD)
Tell me do you find the best way to
enhance your popularity with your
patients is to tell them whatever it
is they most want to hear

AND

PINK Revision - 6610 37-38

JUNG
Does it matter whether were popular
with them or not

GROSS
Well I dont know suppose you want
to fuck them

JUNG looks across at GROSS not sure if hes joking What he
says next is deadly serious

GROSS (CONTD)
If theres one thing Ive learned in
my short life its this never
repress anything

INT THERAPY HALL BURGHOLZLI- EVENING

A small hall in the hospital reserved for music and
performance therapy About thirty restless patients sit on
steel-frame chairs listening to an opera playing on an
elegant wax-cylinder phonograph with a large brass trumpet-
like speaker

An ornately dramatic theatrical poster on the wall behind
the table identifies the opera as Wagners DIE WALKURE

An enormous crash of MUSIC its the moment close to the end
of Act I when Siegmund approaches the sword Notung plunged
up to the hilt in a tree-trunk

SABINA and JUNG sitting on either side of the table
supporting the gramophone scan the audience for reactions
and scribble notes on matching notepads

As the love-duet between Sieglinde and Siegmund reaches an
ecstatic climax SABINA rapt by the music despite her desire
to remain clinical and objective casts an ardent glance
towards JUNG only to find that he is watching her with the
same passionate intensity

Sabina flushes and looks away

INT JUNGS OFFICE - DAY

OTTO GROSS looks across the desk at JUNG his eyes sparkling
with mischief and provocation

GROSS
So youve never slept with any of
your patients

JUNG
Of course not you have to steer
through the temptations of
transference and countertransference
thats an essential stage of the
process

GROSS
When transference occurs when the
patient becomes fixated on me I
explain to her that this is merely a

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

GROSS (CONTD)
symbol of her wretched monogamous
habits I show her that its fine to
want to sleep with me but only if
at the same time she acknowledges
to herself that she wants to sleep
with a great many other people

JUNG
Suppose she doesnt

GROSS
Then its my job to convince her
thats part of the illness

JUNG shakes his head troubled

GROSS (CONTD)
This is what people are like If we
dont tell them the truth who will

JUNG
You think Freuds right You think
all neurosis is of exclusively sexual
origin

GROSS
I think Freuds obsession with sex
probably has a great deal to do with
the fact that he never gets any

JUNG
You could be right

GROSS
It seems to me a measure of the true
perversity of the human race that
one of its very few reliably
pleasurable activities should be the
subject of so much hysteria and
repression

JUNG
But not to repress yourself is to
unleash all kinds of dangerous and
destructive forces
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 41

31 GROSS
Our job is to make our patients
capable of freedom

JUNG
Ive heard it said you helped one of
your patients to kill herself

GROSS
She was resolutely suicidal I just
explained how she could do it without
botching it Then I asked her if
she didnt prefer the idea of becoming
my lover She opted for both

JUNG
That cant be what we want for our
patients

GROSS

Freedom is freedom
He sits up suddenly serious

GROSS (CONTD)
Life being what it is the more
sensitive you are the sicker youll
become So I say whenever you see
an oasis you must always remember
to drink

Quite suddenly a stream of dark blood begins to flow from
one nostril He dabs at himself then looks down at the
blood on his fingertips JUNG hands him a white handkerchief
which he uses to clean up as the blood continues to flow

GROSS (CONTD)
I gave up the opium you cant expect
me to give up the cocaine as well

JUNG
I think you must I dont see how
you can go on

GROSSs expression suddenly turns defiant

GROSS
Ill use the other fucking nostril

JUNG and SABINA walk along the border of Lake Ziirich both

deep in thought At a certain point she takes his arm and
steers him towards a small promontory

EXT PROMONTORY NEAR SCHONLEINSTRASSE - DAY 32B

A small cobble-stoned space with a bench and a few plane
trees the lake spreading out before it SABINA steers JUNG
towards the bench

SABINA

Can we talk for a moment

JUNG

Of course

They sit down
SABINA

Ive been thinking about Wagners

opera In it he says that perfection

can only be arrived at through what

is conventionally thought of as sin
is that right Which must surely

have to do with the energy created

by the friction of opposites not

just that youre the doctor and Im
the patient but that youre Swiss

and Im Russian Im Jewish and youre
Aryan and all kinds of other darker

differences
JUNG
Darker
SABINA
If Im right only the clash of

destructive forces can create
something new

She reaches out to take his hand

SABINA (CONTD)
Its clear that the subject Im
studying is entirely grounded in
sexuality So naturally Im becoming
more and more acutely aware of the
fact that I have no sexual experience

JUNG
Law students are not normally expected
to rob banks

They smile at each other then impulsively SABINA reaches
up puts her hand round the back of JUNGs neck and kisses

him on the lips The kiss lasts some while eventually he
breaks away

JUNG (CONTD)
Its generally thought to be the man
who should take the initiative

SABINA
Dont you think theres something
male in every woman And something
female in every man Or should be

JUNG considers this for a moment

JUNG
Maybe I expect youre right Yes
You must be

SABINA points across at a tall gray stone apartment building
No 7 Schdnleinstrasse

SABINA
If you ever want to take the
initiative I live in that building
there where the bay window is

EXT BURGHOLZLI GARDENS - DAY 33

Its a beautiful summers day and JUNG is talking to OTTO

as if hes the doctor and JUNG is the patient

I cant understand what youre waiting
for

PINK Revision - 6610 42B

GROSS (CONTD)
Just take her to some secluded spot
and thrash her to within an inch of
her life thats clearly what she
wants How can you deny her such a
simple pleasure

JUNG
Pleasure is never simple as you
very well know

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 43

GROSS
It is of course it is until we
decide to complicate it The tragedy
of childhood is the moment we
understand we can never have
everything we want the tragedy of
adulthood is the moment we decide
not to take everything we can have
what my father calls maturity what
I call surrender

JUNG
Surrender for me would be to give
in to these urges

GROSS
Then surrender doesnt matter what
you call it as long as you dont
let the experience escape Thats my
prescription

JUNG
Im supposed to be treating you

GROSS
Yes and its been most effective

JUNG
Id say the analysis was not too far
from completion

GROSS
Mine yes Not so sure about yours

INT JUNGS OFFICE - DAY

JUNG and SABINA have reached a moment of informality at the
end of her consultation

of my other patients Hes immensely
seductive quite sure hes right
and obsessionally neurotic Pretty
dangerous in fact

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 44

SABINA
Do you mean you doubt your power to
convince him

JUNG
Worse than that what Im afraid of
is his power to convince me On the
subject of monogamy for example
Why should we put so much frantic
effort into suppressing our most
basic natural instincts

SABINA looks at him for a moment with calculating candour

SABINA
I dont know you tell me

EXT BURGHOLZLI GARDENS - DAY 35

In a secluded corner of the grounds OTTO GROSS stands
buckling his belt above a young NURSE whos more or less
naked

GROSS
Thank you I really needed that

And so saying he uses a convenient tree to scramble up to
the top of the brick wall surrounding the gardens The NURSE
appalled is still grappling with her clothes as with a
jaunty mocking wave GROSS disappears over the wall

INT GROSSS ROOM —- DAY 36
The room in the hospital is in extraordinary disarray its

most conspicuous feature a series pinned to the wall of

sombre spidery somewhat Egon Schiele-like pen-and-ink

sketches mostly nudes Among them is a sheet of paper

labelled DR JUNG which JUNG now unpins and turns over

The note says

uncomfortably aware of the ungainliness of her movements

EMMA
Im sorry to be like this again

JUNG
What do you mean

EMMA
So big and unattractive

JUNG
Dont be absurd

EMMA
I expect you wish you were a
polygamist like Otto Gross

Theyve stopped a few steps away from the front door JUNG
is frowning thoughtfully

JUNG
If I were it would be something
quite different from what we have
which is sacred I would have to be
sure you understood that

happy JUNG beams down at her

EMMA
I knew it was a boy this time I

The following year FADE UP on the terrace above the Belvedere
gardens in the shadow of the towering baroque palace looking
down across the city of Vienna The small dapper figure of
FREUD with his gloves and walking-stick moves alongside

the much taller JUNG formal in dark suit and hat

FREUD
I should never have sent Gross to
you I blame myself

JUNG
No Im very grateful you did All
those provocative discussions
helped crystallise a lot of my

thinking

FREUD
And did he really send you his hotel
bill

JUNG

Only for a couple of nights

FREUD
Hes an addict I realise that now
He can only end by doing great harm
to our movement

FREUD broods for a moment then cheers up

FREUD (CONTD)
You realise this makes you undisputed
Crown Prince dont you My son and
heir

They come to a halt beneath one of the strange opulently
feminine sphinxes which line the fagade of the palace

They look out over the city below

FREUD (CONTD)
I often take my walk up here

He looks up at the sphinx for a moment

FREUD (CONTD)
Its inspired some of my best ideas

INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT

The middle of the night The full ashtray suggests that FREUD
and JUNG have been deep in discussion for several hours

FREUD
You mustnt think I have a closed
mind I have absolutely no objection
to you studying telepathy or
parapsychology to your hearts
content But I would make the point
that our own field is so embattled
it can only be dangerous to stray
into any kind of mysticism Dont
you see We have to stay within the
most rigorously scientific confines

He breaks off frowning at JUNG who is resting a hand on
his stomach his expression increasingly pained

FREUD (CONTD)
Are you all right

JUNG
Yes but I cant agree with you
Why should we draw some arbitrary
line and close off whole areas of
investigation

FREUD
Precisely because the world is full
of enemies looking for any way they

can to discredit us And the minute
they see us abandon the firm ground
of sexual theory to wallow in the
black mud of superstition theyll
pounce As far as Im concerned
even to raise these subjects is
professional suicide Really you

Again he breaks off this time because the wood in his
bookshelves has cracked so loudly that it causes FREUD to
duck involuntarily

FREUD (CONTD)
What in Gods name was that

JUNG

I knew that was going to happen
FREUD

What
JUNG

I felt something like that was going
to happen I had a kind of burning
in my stomach

FREUD
What are you talking about Its the
heating the wood in the bookcase
just cracked thats all

JUNG
No its whats known as a catalytic
exteriorisation phenomenon

FREUD

JUNG
In a minute its going to happen

FREUD

My dear young friend this is exactly
the kind of thing Im talking about
you must promise me to

But hes interrupted by another deafening report from the
bookcase He looks up at it for once entirely at a loss for
words

JUNG
You see

FREUD
Thats just you really cant

JUNG
There are so many mysteries so much
further to go

FREUD
Please We cant be too careful
We cant afford to wander into these
speculative areas telepathy singing
bookcases fairies at the bottom of
the garden It wont do

JUNG is looking back at him unconvinced his jaw stubbornly
set

INT SABINAS APARTMENT - DAY

JUNG has been making love to SABINA from behind hes tucked
in between her and the wall on her narrow single bed

SABINA
Theres a poem by Lermontov keeps
going round my head about a prisoner
who finally achieves some happiness
when he succeeds in releasing a bird
from its cage

JUNG
Why do you think this is preoccupying
you

SABINA

I think it means that when I become

a doctor what I want more than
anything is to give people back their
freedom the way you gave me mine

Later SABINA bends over the corner of the bed JUNG beats
her until she reaches a climax

INT CONSULTING ROOM BURGHOLZLI - DAY

An anxious-looking PATIENT a woman in her thirties in a
dressing-gown is being helped out of the room by a NURSE
and an ORDERLY FREUD sitting as an observer in a discreet
corner of the room rises to his feet and approaches JUNG
speaking with no concern as to whether or not the PATIENT
can hear him

FREUD
Fascinating All the standard symptoms
of the nymphomaniac

JUNG waits until the door has closed behind the PATIENT

JUNG
Yes except that whenever anyone
responded to her advances she would
run a mile Thats the puzzling
feature of the case

FREUD
Hm

He looks around the room

slightly terrified FREUD aboard the boat with red sails

EXT LAKE ZURICH - DAY

The boat glides across the water taking advantage of a stiff
breeze FREUD sits bolt upright as close to the dead centre
of the boat as he can manage facing JUNG who lolls back in

shirtsleeves a hand on the tiller

FREUD
Theres a rumour running around Vienna
that youve taken one of your patients
as a mistress

JUNG sits up hes very shocked it takes him a moment to
recover

JUNG
Its absolutely untrue

FREUD
Well of course it is So Ive been
telling everyone

JUNG
Whats being said

FREUD
Oh I dont know that the womans
been bragging about it that
somebodys sending out anonymous
letters usual sort of thing
Bound to happen sooner or later
its an occupational hazard

He shakes his head amused

FREUD (CONTD)
These women the way they try to
seduce us the way they use every
conceivable psychic wile Its one
of natures most dramatic spectacles

Yes I hope Id never be stupid enough
to get emotionally involved with a

He adjusts the tiller his composure beginning to return
INT SABINAS APARTMENT - DAY

unhappily as JUNG finishes dressing Eventually he sits on
a chair facing her knotting his tie his expression grave

JUNG

trapped myself into feeling divided
and guilty

SABINA
Ive never wanted you to feel guilty

JUNG
I dont see how we can go on

He rises unsteadily to his feet SABINA springs out of bed
and flings her arms around him

SABINA
You mustnt say that

JUNG
I have some kind of illness Try to
remember the love and patience I
showed towards you when you were
ill Thats what I need from you
now

SABINA

JUNG
No I dont think he ever recovered
from his first view of the house

JUNG shakes his head

JUNG (CONTD)
I suppose compared to that tiny
flat in Vienna

EMMA
Why did he refuse to meet the Herr
Direktor

JUNG

Oh hes always been a great one
for bearing incomprehensible
grudges

EMMA looks at him her expression changing

EMMA
Did he say anything to you about
anonymous letters

JUNG looks up shocked He stops eating in mid-chew EMMA
watches him for a second then speaks very quietly

EMMA (CONTD)
Surely you didnt think Id let you
go without putting up a fight

Why are you doing this

JUNG
Please sit down

SABINA
How could you treat me this way

JUNG
Sit down

Tense silence then she sits in the chair furthest away from
his desk

JUNG (CONTD)
I tried to explain the situation to
your mother

SABINA
I dont know how you dared say those
things to her

JUNG
She came in waving an anonymous
letter demanding to know if it was
true I told her even if it were
the position would not be quite as
she imagined since youre no longer
my patient

SABINA
Of course Im your patient

JUNG
Technically not not since I stopped
charging you

SABINA
Thats what she said I told her I
didnt believe her and she told me
you said your fee was ten francs a
consultation

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 58
54 JUNG
I was trying to point out that I
would take you back as a patient
but that I could only undertake to
see you inside this office

SABINA
How can you be so cold and offhand

JUNG
I was trying to make her understand
the distinction between a patient
and a friend

He makes a huge effort to remain calm

JUNG (CONTD)
Listen Ive made a stupid mistake

SABINA
Is that what it was

JUNG
I broke one of the elementary rules
of my profession Im your doctor
and I believe I did you some good
I cant forgive myself for
overstepping the mark I should have
known that if I gave you what you
wanted you wouldnt be able to help
wanting more

SABINA
I dont want more I never wanted
more I never asked for more

JUNG
You didnt have to ask

SABINA
Even if youre right which I dispute
you think this is a proper way to
behave towards me Refusing to speak
to me except in your office

JUNG
Im your physician from now on
thats all I can be
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 59

Silence Finally SABINA looks up at him

SABINA
Dont you love me anymore
JUNG
Only as your physician
SABINA
You think Im going to stand for
this
JUNG

What choice do you have

Moving with tremendous speed SABINA is on her feet and round
the desk where she deals him a staggering openhanded blow

to the face JUNG struggles to his feet under a rain of blows
until hes able to grip her wrists

JUNG (CONTD)
You have to understand Im your
physician

Shes glaring fiercely at him as soon as he releases her
wrists once again moving like lightning she grabs the paper-
knife from the desk and lunges at him

SABINA
Then heal thyself

Shes opened up a gash on his cheek and as he puts up an
astonished hand to feel the blood which is starting to well
she goes for him again This time hes able to grasp her
wrist and disarm her after a short vicious struggle She
takes a couple of steps back still shaking with fury Then
she reaches into her bag pulls out a tenfranc note and slaps
it on to his cheek where it adheres

SABINA (CONTD)
And theres your ten francs

She rushes blindly from the room leaving JUNG standing
amazed reaching up to peel the banknote from his bloody
cheek

INT SABINAS APARTMENT - NIGHT 55

SABINA is at her desk in a pool of lamplight dressed in her
nightgown pen in hand She begins to write

SABINA (VO)
Dear Professor Freud

She looks up clearing away tears with the back of her hand

SABINA (CONTD)
---I would be most grateful if you
would allow me to come and visit you
in Vienna on a matter of great
interest to us both

INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT 56
FREUD is at his desk writing

FREUD (VO)
Dear friend I have just received
this extremely strange letter

INT JUNGS STUDY KUSNACHT - DAY 57

JUNG sits in his beautifully designed new study with its
views of the garden leading down to the lake reading a letter
from FREUD while in the other hand he holds SABINAs letter

FREUD (VO)
Do you know this woman Who is she

EXT GARDENS KUSNACHT - DAY 58

JUNG and EMMA take tea at a table close to the lake The

baby FRANZ is in his pram while the two girls AGATHE 5
and GRET 3 play under the watchful eye of their NURSEMAID
EMMA is watching JUNG who looks pale and tense and a thousand
miles away

was the case that brought you and me
together for which reason I have
always regarded her with special
gratitude and affection until I

JUNG (VO) (CONTD)
understood that she was systematically
planning my seduction Now I have no
idea what her intentions may be
revenge I suspect

INT FREUDS STUDY - DAY 59
FREUD reads JUNGs letter

JUNG (VO)
I have never shown such friendship
to a patient nor have I ever been
made to suffer so much in return I
am hoping you will agree to act as a
kind of go-between and avert a
disaster

FREUD frowns scratching his chin and puffing at his cigar
EXT LAKE ZURICH - DAY 60

JUNG sits alone at the tiller of his boat The weather is
overcast the lake choppy and deserted

JUNG (VO)
Your famous saying is carved in block
letters on my heart Whatever you
do give up any idea of trying to
cure them

He takes a letter out of his pocket to re-read it

FREUD (VO)
Experiences like this however
painful are necessary and inevitable
Without them how can we know life

INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT 61

FREUD is poised to write Beside him the methodical pile of
his daily correspondence

FREUD (VO)
Dear Miss Spielrein Dr Jung is a
good friend and colleague of mine
whom I believe to be incapable of
frivolous or shabby behaviour
(MORE )

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 62

FREUD (VO) (CONTD)
What I infer from your letter is
that you used to be close friends
but are no longer so

INT SABINAS APARTMENT - NIGHT

SABINA lies on her narrow bed sobbing the pages of FREUDs
letter spread out across her stomach

FREUD (VO)
If this is the case I would urge
you to consider whether the feelings
that have survived this close
friendship are not best suppressed
and forgotten and without the
intervention and involvement of third
persons such as myself

INT JUNGS OFFICE - DAY

JUNG is in the process of clearing out his office loading
books and papers into cardboard boxes The scar on his cheek
has almost disappeared He looks up and is shocked to see
SABINA standing in the doorway When he speaks his tone is
harsh

JUNG
What is it

SABINA
I heard you were leaving the hospital

JUNG
As you see

SABINA
People are saying its because of
the scandal I caused

JUNG

Id been planning to leave anyway
SABINA

Well Im sorry if I precipitated

it

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 63

JUNG
Youve always been something of a

catalyst

SABINA advances a little further into the room her tone
less defensive

SABINA
Ive had a letter from Professor
Freud

JUNG
Oh yes

SABINA

The thing that shone through was how
much he loves you

JUNG nods abruptly his reaction to this evidently ambivalent

SABINA (CONTD)
But what was also clear is that you
denied everything You let him think
I was a fantasist or a liar

JUNG
I dont see that its any of his
business

SABINA
Ive come to ask you to tell him the
truth

JUNG
What

SABINA
I want you to write and tell him
everything

JUNG is obviously horrified by this suggestion

SABINA (CONTD)
And I want him to write to me again
to confirm youve told him everything

JUNG
Are you blackmailing me

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 64

SABINA
Im asking you to tell the truth

JUNG
Why is this so important to you

SABINA
I want him to take me as his patient

JUNG is appalled

JUNG
Does it have to be him

SABINA
It has to be him

She looks at him for a moment considering his tormented
expression

SABINA (CONTD)
You dont feel the same way about
him do you

JUNG
Im disappointed by his rigid
pragmatism his insistence that
nothing can possibly exist unless
some puny and transitory intelligence
has first become aware of it

SABINA
All the same will you write to him

JUNG looks away not answering

SABINA (CONTD)
I could have damaged you you know
far worse than I did I chose not
to

JUNG
All right Ill do it

SABINA
Thank you It means everything to
me

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 65
63 JUNG moves to look out of the window

JUNG
Are you going somewhere for the
summer

SABINA

Berlin with my parents

JUNG
But you are going to come back to
the University To qualify

SABINA
Of course

JUNG
Im going to America With Freud
although he doesnt yet know it

SABINA
Thats nice Goodbye

JUNG turns back from the window surprised but shes already
gone

64 INT FREUDS STUDY - DAY

FREUD has a letter in his hand hes looking into the middle
distance with an expression of considerable satisfaction

JUNG (VO)
--in view of my friendship for the
patient and her complete trust in
me what I did was indefensible I
confess this very unhappily to
you my father-figure

FREUD permits himself a very faint smile
65 EXT NO7 SCHONLEINSTRASSE - DAY

SABINA stands surrounded by suitcases in front of her
apartment building A taxi pulls up at the curb

FREUD (VO)
Dear Miss Spielrein I owe you an
apology

(MORE )

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 66

FREUD (VO) (CONTD)
But the fact that I was wrong and
that the man is to be blamed rather
than the woman satisfies my own
need to revere women Please accept
my admiration for the very dignified
way you have resolved this conflict

INT TAXI — DAY

As from her POV the apartment building recedes and
vanishes SABINA turns back a prey to conflicting emotions

EXT DOCKSIDE - DAY

A small knot of psychoanalysts has gathered at the foot of

the gangplank leading up to the imposing height of the SS
George Washington to see off JUNG FREUD and their travelling-
companion SANDOR FERENCZI 36 a mild-looking Hungarian
analyst and fervent disciple of FREUD Setting off up the
gangplank FREUD pauses to wave regally to his followers

then he turns somewhat irritably to FERENCZI

FREUD
Do we have all the necessary
paperwork Ferenczi

FERENCZI
I have everything Professor

FREUD
Ive always been in two minds about
America Are we making a foolish
error Do they really want us there

FERENCZI
They postponed the Congress two months
so that you could attend Professor
Surely that gives you some indication

FREUD
Yes

By contrast to FREUD JUNG looks genuinely exhilarated
JUNG

I think its going to be a great
adventure

BLUE Revision - 6510 67

FREUD
I hope youre right

But he continues to look sceptical
INT DECK SS GEORGE WASHINGTON - DAY

By now theyve reached the head of the gangplank and an
OFFICER is inspecting the papers proffered by JUNG and
FERENCZI JUNGs papers are returned first with a
deferential bow

JUNG
I go this way

FREUD
What do you mean

JUNG
I left my wife to make the
arrangements Im afraid shes booked
me a first-class stateroom

FREUD
I see

Hes extremely displeased He glares after JUNG as the latter
sets off escorted by a STEWARD

EXT DECK SS GEORGE WASHINGTON - DAY

The ship glides slowly through Atlantic fog across a glassy
sea FREUD wrapped in heavy overcoat and plaid blanket
shuffles around the deck accompanied by JUNG who has to
keep slowing down so as not to leave him behind

JUNG
I was on the Swiss-Austrian border
somewhere in the mountains at dusk
There was a long wait because
everybodys baggage was being
searched I noticed a decrepit
customs official wearing the old
royal and imperial uniform and I was
watching him walking up and down
with his melancholy and disgruntled
expression when someone said to me
He isnt really there hes a ghost
who still hasnt found out how to
die properly

67A

BLUE Revision - 6510

FREUD
Is that the whole dream

67A

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

JUNG
All I can remember

FREUD
Did you say the Swiss-Austrian border

JUNG
Yes

FREUD
Must have something to do with us

JUNG
You think so

FREUD
Everybodys being searched Perhaps
thats an indication that the ideas
which used to flow so freely between
us are now subject to the most
suspicious examination

JUNG
You mean the ideas flowing in your
direction

FREUD
And Im afraid the old relic shuffling
about in this entirely useless fashion
must almost certainly be me

JUNG
Wait a minute

FREUD
Whom you very mercifully wish could
be put out of his misery A humane
death wish

JUNG
Perhaps the fact he was unable to
die simply indicated the immortality
of his ideas

FREUD
So you agree it must have been me

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

JUNG
I didnt say that
FREUD
Never mind its a most entertaining

example
He stops for a moment to look out to sea

JUNG
What about you do you have a dream
to report

FREUD
I had a most elaborate dream last
night Particularly rich

JUNG
Lets hear it

Silence JUNG is left staring at FREUDs back for some time

FREUD
Id love to tell you but I dont
think I should

JUNG
Why ever not

FREUD turns to look at him smiles mirthlessly

FREUD
I wouldnt want to risk my authority

JUNGs mouth opens and shuts hes nonplussed
EXT NEW YORK HARBOUR —- DAY

The George Washington steams past the Statue of Liberty
towards the dazzling New York skyline FREUD contemplates
it frowning hes flanked by JUNG JUNG is absolutely
entranced

at is the future

But do you think they have any idea

JUNG looks at FREUD with incomprehension They are standing
shoulder to shoulder but there seems a thousand miles between
them

SLOW FADE TO BLACK
EXT TOWER KUSNACHT - DAY 70

SABINA is 25 now her hair fashionably restyled and her dress
new

She walks firmly down the long tree-lined stone pathway
leading to the intimidating tower of the Jungs villa but
hesitates at the front door a little overcome then she
summons up her courage and tugs at the bell-pull

A CAPTION KUSNACHT 25TH SEPTEMBER 1910
INT JUNGS STUDY - DAY 71

SABINA stands in the window looking out at the garden and
the lake beyond shes considerably startled by the VOICE of
AGATHE JUNG now 6 who has come into the room without her
noticing

AGATHE
Whats your name
SABINA
Sabina
AGATHE
Sabina Hello Sabina My names
Agathe
SABINA

Hello Agathe

AGATHE
Are you staying to lunch

JUNG
I dont think she can today So say
goodbye
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 71

Again SABINA is startled this time by JUNG whos spoken
on his way into the room

AGATHE
Goodbye Sabina

SABINA
Goodbye Agathe

The little girl runs out of the room leaving the two adults
looking intensely constrained SABINA is making a not entirely
successful effort not to tremble

He motions for her to sit down and reaches for a bulky
document on his desk

JUNG
Whose idea was it that you should
send me your dissertation

SABINA
The Herr Direktor

JUNG
Ah yes of course

SABINA
He kept insisting this was the kind
of material you were looking for for
your Yearbook

JUNG
It certainly is a very fascinating
case youve chosen to investigate
But if were to consider it for the
Yearbook there are one or two mistakes
which will have to be dealt with

SABINA
Of course

JUNG
Might you have a little time to
discuss all this

SABINA
Well yes

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

JUNG
When I left the hospital and moved
out here I was afraid it would take
years to build up a roster of
patients but Im afraid were already
under siege

He reaches for his diary starts to consult it

SABINA
Hows Mrs Jung

JUNG
Very well I dont suppose youll be
amazed to hear shes expecting another
addition to the family any day now

SABINA
Congratulations

JUNG
Thank you

SABINA

Your house is beautiful

JUNG
Thanks Anyway I dont see why a
little more work shouldnt make
your dissertation eminently
publishable

SABINA
Do you think wed be able to work on
it together without

She breaks off They look at one another for a moment

JUNG
Its always going to be something of
a risk seeing one another

SABINA
Yes

JUNG
But I believe we have the character
to be able to deal with the situation
dont you

71A

BLUE Revision - 6510 73

SABINA
I hope so

Dangerous silence

SABINA (CONTD)
I somehow imagined youd have found
another admirer by now

JUNG looks away then back to her

JUNG
No You were the jewel of great price

He makes an effort and resumes a businesslike tone

JUNG (CONTD)
Shall we say this time next Tuesday
And Ill start gently ripping you to
shreds

EXT PROMONTORY NEAR SCHONLEINSTRASSE - DAY

JUNG contemplates Sabinas apartment He lights his pipe
then crosses the street

INT SABINAS APARTMENT - DAY

Back in Sabinas old apartment now somewhat spruced up
JUNG and SABINA discuss the dissertation which lies spread
out on the coffee table in front of them

JUNG
Explain this analogy you make between
the sex instinct and the death
instinct

SABINA
Professor Freud claims the sexual
drive arises from a simple urge
towards pleasure If hes right the
question is why is this urge so often
successfully repressed

JUNG
You used to have a theory involving
the impulse towards destruction and
self-destruction losing oneself

71A

BLUE Revision - 6510 73A

SABINA
Well suppose we think of sexuality
as fusion losing oneself as you
say but losing oneself in the other

72 72

SABINA (CONTD)
in other words destroying ones own
individuality Wouldnt the ego in
self-defence automatically resist
that impulse

JUNG
You mean for selfish not for social
reasons

SABINA

Yes Im saying perhaps true sexuality
demands the destruction of the ego

JUNG
(with quiet
satisfaction)
In other words the opposite of what
Freud proposes

73 INT SABINAS APARTMENT - LATER 73

SABINA cries out in pain Shes bent along the top of the
sofa Her hands are tied together with a leather belt and
shes watching herself in the mirror on the opposite wall as
JUNG moves behind her causing her to cry out again

74 INT SABINAS APARTMENT - LATER 74

JUNG sitting at a small table clothes in disarray scribbles
a note on Sabinas dissertation SABINA on the other side

of the room looks at him her face tense as she winds up

the courage to say what she feels she has to

SABINA
When I graduate Ive decided to
leave Ziirich

JUNG looks up completely taken by surprise

SABINA (CONTD)
I have to

JUNG
Why

SABINA
You know why

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 75

Silence broken by a deep sigh from JUNG

JUNG

Its true Im nothing but a
philistine Swiss bourgeois A
complacent coward I want to break
away and leave everything and
disappear with you and then comes
the voice of the philistine

(pause)
Where will you go

SABINA
Vienna maybe

JUNG
Please dont go there

SABINA
I must go wherever I need to feel
free

Abruptly JUNG bursts into tears he gets up from his desk
moves round it and crashes to his knees in front of SABINA
burying his face in her lap

JUNG
Dont

She looks down at his large head and heaving shoulders with
infinite sadness but as she reaches down to stroke his
hair shes dry-eyed and determined-looking

FADE
INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT

FADE UP on FREUD as he lights his cigar and contemplates
SABINA benevolently across his desk

A CAPTION TWO YEARS LATER VIENNA 17TH APRIL 1912

FREUD
You know your paper led to one of
the most stimulating discussions
weve ever had at the Psychoanalytic
Society Do you really think the
sexual drive

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 76

He breaks off briefly to consult his notes

FREUD (CONTD)
-is a demonic and destructive
force

SABINA
Yes at the same time as being a
creative force in the sense that it
can produce out of the destruction
of two individualities a new being
But the individual always has to
overcome a resistance because of the
self-annihilating nature of the sexual
act

FREUD
Ive fought against the idea for
some time but I suppose there must
be some kind of indissoluble link
between sex and death I dont feel
the relationship between the two is
quite as youve portrayed it but
Im most grateful to you for animating
the subject in such a stimulating
way The only slight shock was your
introduction at the very end of
your paper of the name of Christ

SABINA
Are you completely opposed to any
kind of religious dimension in our
field

FREUD
In general I dont care if a man
believes in Rama Marx or Aphrodite
as long as he keeps it out of the
consulting room

SABINA
Is that whats at the bottom of your
dispute with Dr Jung

FREUD
I have no dispute with Dr Jung I
was simply mistaken about him
(MORE )

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

FREUD (CONTD)
I thought he was going to be able to
carry our work forward after I was
gone I didnt bargain for all that
second-rate mysticism and self-
aggrandising shamanism I didnt
realise he could be so brutal and
sanctimonious

SABINA
Hes trying to find some way forward
so that we dont just have to tell
our patients this is why you are
the way you are he wants to be able
to say we can show you what you
might want to become

FREUD
Playing God in other words We have
no right to do that The world is
as it is understanding and accepting
that is the way to psychic health
What good can we do if our aim is
simply to replace one delusion with
another

SABINA
Well I agree with you

FREUD
Ive noticed that in the crucial
areas of dispute between Dr Jung
and myself you tend to favour me

SABINA
I thought you had no dispute with
him

FREUD smiles acknowledging hes been caught out Then his
brow furrows

FREUD
You still love him dont you

SABINA

Thats not why Im pleading his cause

(MORE )

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 78
75 SABINA (CONTD)
I just feel that if you two dont
find a way to co-exist it will hold
back the progress of psychoanalysis
perhaps indefinitely

FREUD
If you still love him its because
you havent yet understood the hatred
he deserves I believe hes quite
capable of destroying all the good
work of the last twenty years and
putting nothing of value in its place
However since you do love him Ill
restrain myself

SABINA
Is there no way to avert a rupture

FREUD
Correct scientific relations will be
maintained of course Ill be seeing
him at the editorial meeting in Munich
in November and I shall be perfectly
civil To tell you the truth what
finished him for me was all that
business about you the lies the
ruthless behaviour I was very
shocked On your behalf

SABINA
I think he loved me

FREUD
All the more reason to behave better
wouldnt you say Im afraid your
idea of a mystical union with a blond
Siegfried was inevitably doomed
Put not your trust in Aryans Were
Jews my dear Miss Spielrein and
Jews we will always be

SABINA looks back at him surprised by the sudden intensity
in his voice Aware of this he takes a puff of his cigar
and speaks in a quite different tone

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 79

FREUD (CONTD)
Now the real reason I invited you
here this evening was to ask if youd
be prepared to take on one or two of
my patients

SABINAs face lights up in genuine delight
INT CONFERENCE ROOM PARK HOTEL MUNICH - DAY

Present are the presidents of the local societies Freud
Jung Abraham Seif Ernest Jones Riklin and Johan van
Ophuijsen secretary of the Ziirich society

JUNG is on his feet gathering up his papers as the rest of
the DELEGATES who have been sitting round a long table
covered in green baize now littered with half-empty carafes
and glasses of water head for the doors

FREUD at the head of the table some way away is also
marshalling his documents Theyre obviously going to be
the last two men left in the room and as if bowing to the
inevitable reluctantly FREUD eventually speaks

FREUD
I think that was a fairly satisfactory
session dont you

JUNG
I was interested in what you said
about monotheism that it arose
historically out of some kind of
patricidal impulse

FREUD
Yes Akhnaton who as far as we know
was the first to put forward the
bizarre notion that there was only
one God also had his fathers name
erased and chiselled out of all public
monuments

JUNG
Thats not strictly true

FREUD pauses in the act of tidying his papers He looks up
at JUNG a ferocious glint in his eye

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 80

FREUD
Not true
JUNG
No
FREUD

You mean its most probably a myth

JUNG
No I mean there were two perfectly
straightforward reasons for Akhnaton
or Amenhopis IV as I prefer to call
him to excise his fathers name
from the cartouches First this
was something traditionally done by
all new kings who didnt wish their
fathers names to continue to be
public currency

FREUD
In much the same way as your article
in the Yearbook fails to mention my
name

The atmosphere is becoming electric

JUNG
Your name is so well-known it hardly
seemed necessary to mention it

FREUD
Do go on

JUNG
Secondly Amenhopis only struck out
the first half of his fathers name
Amenhotep because like the first
half of his own name it was shared
by Amon one of the gods he was
determined to eliminate

FREUD
As simple as that

JUNG
The explanation doesnt seem to me
unduly simple

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 81

FREUD
And you think your man whatever you
call him felt no hostility whatsoever
towards his father

JUNG
Ive no means of proof of course
For all I know Amenhopis may have
thought his fathers name was quite
familiar enough and that now it might
be time to make a name for himself

At which point FREUD faints pitching forward ricocheting
off the table and ending in a heap on the floor JUNG bounds
forward gathers him up in his arms carries him across the
room and lowers him gently on to one of the old brown sofas
which line the walls FREUD comes to and looks up at JUNG
fear and vulnerability openly expressed on his face

FREUD
How sweet it must be to die

INT JUNGS STUDY - DAY
JUNG sits at his desk writing a letter

JUNG (VO)
If I may say so dear Professor you
make the mistake of treating your
friends like patients This enables
you to reduce them to the level of
children so that their only choice
is to become obsequious nonentities
or bullying enforcers of the party
line

INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT

FREUD sits frowning in a haze of cigar smoke reading a
letter

JUNG (VO)
---while you sit on the mountaintop
the infallible father-figure and
nobody dares to pluck you by the
beard and say think about your
behaviour and then decide which one
of us is the neurotic I speak as a
friend

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 82

FREUD utters a bark of incredulous laughter and reaches for
his pen

INT DINING ROOM KUSNACHT - DAY

JUNG looks up from his substantial breakfast as the MAID
arrives with his correspondence on a silver tray He reaches
for the letters sees immediately the familiar handwriting
on one of them and impatiently breaks open the letter

FREUD (VO)
Your letter cannot be answered
Your claim that I treat my friends
like patients is self-evidently
untrue As to which of us is the
neurotic I thought we analysts were
agreed a little neurosis was nothing
whatever to be ashamed of

EXT UPPER BELVEDERE VIENNA —- DAY

FREUD walks past the statues of the sphinxes deep in thought
Its a foggy morning the city below shrouded in mist

FREUD (VO)
But a man like you who behaves quite
abnormally and then stands there
shouting at the top of his voice how
normal he is does give considerable
cause for concern

INT DINING ROOM KUSNACHT - DAY
JUNG reads on his face flushing with anger

FREUD (VO)
For a long time now our relationship
has been hanging by a thread and a
thread moreover mostly consisting
of past disappointments We have
nothing to lose by cutting it

JUNG crumples the letter he looks at the same time furious
and bereft

INT FREUDS STUDY - NIGHT

FREUD paces up and down plainly very agitated

JUNG (VO)
You will be the best judge of what
this moment means to you The rest
is silence

Finally FREUD moves to the bookshelf where he picks up a
framed photograph of JUNG considers it with a pained
expression and then lays it back face down on the shelf

EXT LAKE ZURICH - DAY 83

JUNG sits alone out on the lake in the boat with red sails
His face sinks into his hands and he gives an anguished groan

EXT GARDENS KUSNACHT - DAY 84
Its a beautiful sunny day the following summer 1913

JUNG sits in a large wicker chair looking out across the
lake He looks pale and unwell and despite the sunlight
theres a blanket over his knees

Not far off tea is being cleared away and the four JUNG
children play under the supervision of their NURSEMAID
Still at the table are EMMA JUNG and SABINA who wears a

EMMA
Really

The children are being taken away but AGATHE 8 now breaks
away from them

AGATHE

EMMA
No run along with the others

AGATHE
Oh look

Shes seen a butterfly and runs off in pursuit of it EMMA
turns back to SABINA

EMMA
I wish you could help him

SABINA
Why whats the matter

EMMA
Hes not himself Hes very confused
and bogged down with his book Hes
not sleeping Hes not taking on
any new patients He still hasnt
recovered from the violence of his
break with Professor Freud Ive
been around this kind of thing enough
to feel almost sure hes heading for
a nervous breakdown

SABINA
What youre describing is very unlike
my memory of him

EMMA
If you were staying in town Id try
to persuade him to let you analyse
him I know he always set great
store by your opinion You are taking
patients now

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10
84 SABINA
Ive pretty much decided to specialise
in child psychology Im not sure
its a field he approves of I havent
discussed it with him But I think
if the problem can be caught early
enough

EMMA
When the children are of age Im
intending to become a therapist
Although I havent discussed it with
Carl either

SABINA
You must be under a great strain

JUNG raises his head and looks across at them

EMMA
Youd better go and talk to him

Shes about to move off SABINA stops her

SABINA
No one can help him more than you

EMMA
I hope youre right

SABINA leans forward and kisses her on both cheeks then
moves over to join JUNG

SABINA
You have beautiful children

JUNG looks up at her he ignores her remark completely

JUNG
So youre married

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 86

84 SABINA

JUNG

SABINA
Yes a Russian Jew

JUNG
Whats he like

SABINA
Kind

JUNG
Good good

He looks away a spasm of pain crossing his face

SABINA
Are you all right

JUNG
Yes I havent been sleeping very
well I keep having this apocalyptic
dream A terrible flood from the
North Sea to the Alps houses washed
away thousands of floating corpses
Eventually it comes crashing down
into the lake in a great tidal wave
and by this time the water roaring
down like some vast avalanche has
turned into blood The blood of
Europe

SABINA
What do you think it means

JUNG
Ive no idea unless its about to
happen
He turns back to SABINA

JUNG (CONTD)
What are your plans
WHITE Revision - 4-22-10

84 SABINA
Weve been thinking of going back to
Russia
JUNG

As long as you leave Vienna

SABINA
I spoke to him last week I cant
believe theres nothing to be done
to

JUNG
Theres nothing to be done The day
he refused to discuss a dream with
me on the grounds that it might risk
his authority I should have known
After that for me he had no
authority It was a blow when I
discovered youd chosen his side

SABINA
Its not a question of sides I
have to work in the direction my
instinct tells my intelligence is
the right one Dont forget you
cured me with his method And your
differences are not as great as you
both think If you could only find a
way to advance together

JUNG
Is that what you came here to say

SABINA
No I was passing through from
Geneva Naturally I thought I would
stop and visit I have to go for my
train very soon

JUNG
Yes of course Im sorry Im not

He breaks off looks out across the lake again
JUNG (CONTD)

It cant be done

84 JUNG (CONTD)
What hell never accept is that what
we understand has got us nowhere
We have to go into uncharted
territory We have to go back to
the sources of everything we believe
I dont just want to open a door and
show the patient his illness
squatting there like a toad I want
to find a way to help the patient
reinvent himself to send him off on
a journey at the end of which is
waiting the person he was always
intended to be

SABINA
But its no good making yourself ill
in the process

JUNG
Only the wounded physician can hope
to heal

Silence SABINA breaks it her tone calm

SABINA
Im told you have a new mistress

JUNG
Is that right

SABINA
Whats her name

JUNG
Toni

SABINA
Is she like me

JUNG
No

SABINA

Shes an ex-patient

JUNG
Naturally she makes me think of
you
SABINA

How do you make it work

JUNG
I dont know Emma as youve seen
is the foundation of my house Toni
is the perfume in the air

He turns to her

JUNG (CONTD)
My love for you was the most important
thing in my life For better or worse
it made me understand who I am

SABINAs eyes fill with tears JUNG reaches out and rests a
hand on her stomach

JUNG (CONTD)
This should be mine

SABINA
Yes

JUNG
But sometimes you have to do something
unforgivable just to be able to go
on living

WHITE Revision - 4-22-10 90 He leans forward and kisses her gently on the forehead

EXT LAKESIDE ROAD —- DAY

At sunset a taxi putters along the lakeside road leading
away from Kisnacht

INT TAXI — DAY

SABINA turns back from the window Her expression though
full of emotion is calm and not unhappy

She rests a hand lightly on her belly
EXT GARDENS KUSNACHT - DAY
The sun shimmers red-gold on the ethereally tranquil lake

JUNG sits looking out across the water lost in painful
reflection And the SOUND gradually swells growing loud and
louder of some vast avalanche crashing down the mountain

As this SOUND and IMAGE gradually FADE A FINAL roller BEGINS
OTTO GROSS starved to death in Berlin in 1919

synagogue and shot
