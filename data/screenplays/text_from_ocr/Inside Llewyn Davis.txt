Title card

New York City

The card fades out We hold in black

Hard cut to a singer accompanying himself on guitar performing “I’ve Been 1 All Around
This World” He is Llewyn Davis He is spotlit seated on the small stagéiof a New
York club maybe The Gaslight

He finishes the song to applause

Llewyn
Thank you You’ve probably heard that one before but
what the hell

He rises to go but dips back into the mike

If it was never new and it never gets old then it’s a
folk song

As the applause abates something catches Llewyn’s attention

’ Nick Porco the owner of the club Greenwhich Village Italian nods Llewyn over He is
broadly smiling

Nick
Boy you were some mess last night

Llewyn
Yeah sorry Nick I’m an asshole

Nick
Oh I don’t give a shit I even agree about the music
Funny to hear you say it though

Llewyn
Yeah I’m a funny guy

Nick
S’very true Anyways someone wants to see you out back
Llewyn
Who i

Nick
Guy in a suit

A clatter offscreen attracts Llewyns attention
Backlit in the smoky spotlight someone with a battered guitar is just sitting down on the
stool onstage

BACK ALLEY

The steel door of the club swings open and Llewyn emerges A thin angular man older
than Llewyn in a suit a size too big is leaning againstthe far wallof thelalley smoking a

cigarette He studies Llewyn for a beat then in a Kentucky accent

Man

Llewyn

The man tosses the cigarette away and pushes himself off the wall

Man

Llewyn

Llewyn is holding his mouth

Llewyn
Oh for Christ’s sake You yell stuff it’s a show

Man
Ain’t a fuckin fag show

He hits him again
Wasn’t your show
He hits him again and Llewyn goes down in the slush of the alleyway

Llewyn
It’s not the opera jackass

He kicks Llewyn curls into a defensive ball and bellowsfrom behind protective
forearms

Llewyn
Its a fucking baskethouse

The man kicks again
Man
We leavin this fuckin cesspool You kin have it smartass
TRACKING

We are pushing forward at floor-level along a hallway dimly daylit from the room in the
background that it opens into

Music enters at the cut an Italian tenor singing opera The music has some perspective
a record playing in another apartment perhaps down an airshaft

A cat’s feet enter frame and it leads the continuing push in
The cat enters the background room camera keeping pace The cat veers to one side
bringing into frame the bottom of a sofa The arm of someone above frame asleep on

the couch lolls down onto the floor We can hear the sleeper’s heavy breathing

The cat leaps up leaving frame
Close on the sleeper Llewyn Davis lying on his back At the sound oth soft impact he
lets out a startled grunt and his eyes open He blinks

He looks down the length of his body chin digging into chest

His point of view the cat stands on his chest staring back purring with a loud rhythmic
rumble

Llewyn raises a hand to swipe the cat away

As we hear the cat padding around the room we cut wider on Llewyn

eé stirs and rises
swinging his feet out He is in his undies nt

The walls in this den are decorated with masks and totems and other naiye early-
civilization art
Llewyn sits gazing stupidly about for a beat
He reaches for pants plops them into his lap
He look down at the end table just off the sofa arm On it some change and three
subway tokens which he swipes into an‘open hand and dumps into one pants pocket
Also on the table a wallet He thumbs open the bill compartment It contains three

dollars

Close on him as he looks then flips the wallet shut and shoves it into another pocket

DOWN A HALL
We are lookingdown the length of a darkish hallway giving onto the bri

Llewyn’s head appears at the far end as he cranes to peer down the hall He stares out
for a still beat

Llewyn
Hello

No answer

Llewyn relaxes enters the hall walks toward us in his underwear The cat crosses the
room behind him

LIVING ROOM

Llewyn enters and bends with an oomph to pull his guitar out of a case

He sits on a sofa experimenting idly with chords til he finds his way into the continuing
opera He accompanies it through a couple of chord changes humming He loudly
clears phlegm
KITCHEN

Eggs are cracked into a bowl

Wider Llewyn still undied whisks the eggs

After a long beat of vigorous whisking he looks about pulls open a drawer doesn’t see
what he is after He looks around lost at all thecabinetry’

HALLWAY

Llewyn walks down the hall forking scrambled egg from a plate to his mouth idly
looking at the pictures on the walls

LIVING ROOM AGAIN

Llewyn stands mouth agape before a shelf of records running a finger along the frayed
cardboard spines of the record jackets The plate of eggs empty now sits abandoned on
the hi-fi cabinet next to him

He lands on a record pulls it out He looks at the sleeve with a half-smile slips out the
LP puts it on thehi-fi spindle

MINUTES LATER

“Dink’s Song” issues from the hi-fi sung by a harmonizing male duo

Dressed now wearing a corduroy sport coat Llewyin is hunched at a sideboard
scribbling something onto scratch paper

Thanks for the couch I was a sorry mess last night
Na

He signs

LI

COMMON HALLWAY

“Dink’s Song” continues to play now as score

Llewyn is just exiting the apartment guitar case in hand The hallway ig a small space
with only one other apartment door giving on to it there is also an elevator

As Llewyn leaves the cat tries to accompany him

A grunt from Llewyn He tries awkwardly to hook the cat with a foot agit goes by he

fails The purring cat runs to the far end of the hallway

Llewyn hops after it setting down his guitar case One step into pursuit he hears the
apartment door close—solidly—behind him

Llewyn
Shit

He turns back to the door tries the knob which he knows will not turn And it does not
locked

Goddamnit

The cat is winding around the legs of a small table in the hallway Llewyn reaches for
it it eludes him he hems it in with one waving hand and corrals it with the other

He straightens with the cat looks around the small space
He goes to the neighbors’ apartment door and knocks
A beat
Hello
Another knock more silence

He pushes the elevator call button

“

wo

While waiting he pointlessly tries the first apartment door again

We hear the elevator arriving a cage door being slid The outer door is opened by the
attendant

Llewyn grabs his guitar and steps in

Hi Could you could I leave this cat with you

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR

The attendant closes the doors and sets the car in motion

Attendant

Llewyn

Attendant

Llewyn
That’s not a problem is it It’s the Gorfeins’

Attendant
No no I have to run the elevator
ADDRESS BOOK

It is being held open a well-worn address book with sloppy entries faded to different
degrees some made in pencil some in ink

We hear ringing filtered through a phone line
Wider shows Llewyn standing in a phone booth with the handset wedged between
shoulder and ear and one hand holding the address book and the other hugging the cat to
his chest

City traffic rumbles through slush in the background and people walk by in winter wear
all heavier than Llewyn’s corduroy coat

The ringing is cut off by a female voice

Voice
Sociology

Llewyn
Professor Gorfein please

Voice
He’s in a lecture could I take a message

Llewyn

Yeah could you tell him don’t worry Llewyn has the cat
Voice

Llewyn is the cat
Llewyn

STREET

“Dink’s Song” dipped for the preceding dialog comes back full for this bredit

sequence
An Upper West Side sidewalk subway entrance The sign is for the A d E lines
Llewyn descends guitar case in one hand cat hugged to his chest

TURNSTYLE

Guitar hoisted over it

SUBWAY CAR

Llewyn in the middling-crowded train seated body jiggling with the motion of the car
He looks

A strap-hanging businessman in overcoat and narrow-brimmed fedora holds a folded-
back newspaper not reading it He is staring at lightly dressed cat-hugging Llewyn

Back to Llewyn An eye shift

Two black kids probably on their way to school also staring at him

Back to Llewyn The cat jumps free

Llewyn leaps up and crouch-hustles after it People make way for cat and pursuing man
giving looks

WEST 4 STREET

Another sidewalk subway entrance Llewyn emerges the recovered cat once again held
to his chest

VILLAGE STREET

Liewyn walks guitar in hand cat to chest As the credits end he turns into a tenement
building halfway up the street

TENEMENT FOYER

Llewyn scans the tenant list and presses the buzzer for BERKEY 6C No answer He
presses the button for SUPER IC

INSIDE

Llewyn is buzzed in An older Italian man in a wifebeater and blue work pants cinched
high on his midriff cracks open a door at the end of the hall

Llewyn
Hey Nunzio
Nunzio
Yeah they ain’t home though

Llewyn
It’s okay I know Can I use the fire escape

AIRSHAFT

As Llewyn tops the fire escape stairs on the sixth floor He sets the cat down on the
metal-slat landing to free a hand and slide up an apartment window Ashe does so the
cat makes to bolt Llewyn corrals it hugs it while he finishes getting thd window up and
cases inside

i

INSIDE THE BERKEY APARTMENT

Before setting the cat down Llewyn closes the window behind him thenjgoes to the
window next to it which is cracked open and closes that

He sets down the cat

A MINUTE LATER

Llewyn has the door to the refrigerator open and is angling his head to Idpk inside
SAUCER SET ON FLOOR

hear the refrigerator door being opened and closed off and then receding footsteps

Llewyn’s hand enters to pour in some milk The cat scurries in to lap at h milk We
followed by the heavy apartment door being opened and slammed shut

OUTER OFFICE

Small seedy Musician photos on the wall suggest the business is musictrelated Each
posing musician has an arm around the same small stout middle-aged man Some of the
pictures are autographed with sentiments to “Mel”

A pebbled-glass door standing ajar shows an inner office where the short midale-aged
Mel of the pictures sits behind a desk His chin rests squarely on the desktop His
shoulders are slumped down behind the desk

We see effort in his body as we hear something being dragged along the floor

Mel relaxes and rolls his castored chair back He stoops out of the chair and rises
hoisting a filebox he has just pulled from under the desk He drops it on the desktop and
starts leafing through

Llewyin is entering

Llewyn

Ginny enters with a file that Mel examines She leaves

People need time you know Buy you as a solo act Even know

Cincinatti is not good

Ginny’s Voice

Mel

He drops the file shocked
He rounds the desk and leaves the office
Llewyn looks around puzzled

Through the open door we see a wedge of the outer office There is a coat rack Mel’s
hand enters to pluck a coat from it

The hand disappears and after a moment Mel reenters with the coat

Mel

Llewyn
Mel—no

Llewyn pushes through it

APARTMENT DOOR

Beyond him in the apartment’s main room a young man incamo fatigues and boots sits
on a rocker stroking the cat now in his lap The‘young man’s buzz cut shows off a high
forehead

THE COMMONS
Onstage now wearing slacks and sweater Troy performs “The Last Thing on my Mind”

In the audience Llewyn sits near Jean one empty seat between both of them gazing up
at the performance

Hands enter from behind Llewyn to grab his shoulders and squeeze The person—a
young man—drops into the empty seat
Jim
Hey Llewyn Good to see you man

Llewyn

Llewyn smiles and is immediately uncertain whether to look as Jim learls away to give

Jean a kiss
Jim looks up at the performance

Llewyn

He applauds with the crowd as Jim and Jean take the stage
Three guitars and three voices they perform “Early Morning Rain”

Jean swivels at the mike she shares with Jim giving the crowd eye contact When her
look crosses Llewyn it darkens

He gives her a what-did-I-do
Her look moves on

Nick Porco plops himself into the empty chair next to Llewyn

Nick

APARTMENT

Night Light snoring

The cat walks past a large shape on the floor—Troy Nelson—and leaps up out of frame

Llewyn’s light snoring stops in a grunt of surprise as the cat lands on his

He and the purring cat look at each other

Liewyn resting on his side props his head on a fist and stares

Llewyn

His look holds for a beat then wanders around the apartment When it reaches Llewyn
again he sighs then slaps his belly

Well Report for duty Back to Fort Dix

Llewyn

matches

Llewyn

Llewyn

He pushes the window open a foot and reclines on the couch head-towards-window to
smoke

Troy pauses with his kit at the door Near the bedroom he keeps his voice low

Thank Jim and Jean for me Don’t want to wake them

Llewyn
Will do
Troy

Troy goes through the door and eases it shut behind him

Llewyn draws on the cigarette angles the exhale towards the window then looks back
into the room

The cat walks toward him tail up purring

Llewyn
What’s your name again

The cat leaps onto the sill and is out the window
Fuck

He lunges for it sticking an arm through the window over the fire escape—but is not
even close

He sticks his head out the window

His point-of-view down the cat pat-pat-pats away down the fire escape toward the
alley below each step on the metal stairs giving the faintest clung

Fuck Llewyn

He draws his head back in banging the back of it on the window sash dnd bolts for the
apartment door and through it letting it close behind him with a SLAM

He passes a surprised Troy Nelson one flight down

Very very quiet

He looks around

Gold records on the wall tastefully framed

Black-and white photographs nicely lit of performers in the studio Different genres

The muted click of a door latch draws Llewyn’s attention

Mel’s office stands ajar exposing de

Llewyn looks over at-Ginny typing something

Llewyn

Ginny i

Llewyn
Boy that man goes to a lot of funerals i

She continues typing
Ginny

whose mother just passed

Llewyn
I don’t know if that’s family

Ginny’s eyes remain on her work

Ginny

Llewyn

I forgot to pick up my mail yesterday ‘So pissed at Mel
Ginny”

Ya didn’t forget to pick up your mail

Licwyn

Yes I did

Ginny

You don’t have any mail

Llewyn
Oh (beat) Shit Nothing (she types on he is hesitant)

Ginny
You were supposed to get something from Bud Grossman
Llewyn
I had Mel send him my solo record When it came out
Whenever more than a month ago

Ginny
Oh

She stops typing and rises giving Llewyn momentary hope

No you didn’t get anything but we were making space

§

in the stock room and dumped the rest of the old record All the
remainduhs Yours and Mikey’s

Mel set one box aside thought you might want to ke

She hoists a box from behind the counter
p
some copies

Llewyn pulls a copy from the box shaking his head and looks at the

The artists are Timlin and Davis Llewyn himself recognizable though clean-shaven
looking only a little younger on a stool with a guitar mouth frozen midtsong Standing
behind him is presumably Mike Timlin transported by the music joyously vocalizing
to the heavens with his body tensed and his hands turned up The namejofthe record is
“If We Had Wings”

Llewyn
Whuh 1 (strugs) Whatm I gonna do with ’em
Ginny resumes typing
Ginny

Should I throw ’em out

HALLWAY
ae i
The dingy hallway of the office’s building “Dink’s Song” plays
Llewyn hasthe box atthe elevator and presses it with his body against the wall in order

to free one-hand and hit the call button

STREETS

The song-continues to play as Llewyn walks down slushy Village streets sweating the

box held awkwardly out before his stomach

a se eae

VESTIBULE
The box is body-pressed against the vestibule wall and Llewyn’s freed hand goes to the
directory It finds CODY 6A and buzzes

STAIRWELL

We are looking down six flights’ worth of stairwell We catch glimpses of Llewyn
ascending midway up some of his shoulder and his arm pressing box to stomach
swinging into view with each laborious footfall

SIXTH-FLOOR HALLWAY

A spent Llewyn drops the box to the floor and leans against the door jamb ‘of 6A and
knocks panting

core

We jump in as Al from the recording session opens the door

Al
Good here’s the key I’m running ¢ out to dersey to pick up
my mother’s car ie

Llewyn
(heavy panting)
Okay
INSIDE THE APARTMENT

Llewyn looks around the small studio hands on hips

He sits and bounces experimentally on the couch how’s this one He swings his legs up
and lies backtosee ifit affords full extension Pretty close

He rises and bends ‘down to shove his record box under Al’s couch It won’t go under all
the way something is ‘blocking

Llewyn peeks reaches under pulls out an uncovered box similar to his packed with
LP’s

He pulls one out showing that the box contains copies of one record Its title Another
Point of View The artist Al Cody The cover photograph of Al whom we’ ve only seen
happy has him looking rather pensive

Llewyn gazes at the album

He is tensing rising looking out the window

You don’t listen you just spout vitriol
Jean looks at him puzzled by the trance he has entered His eyes widen further
Keep an eye on my shit

He bolts

OUTSIDE

Llewyn pounds down the sidewalk missing most—but bumping some—of the
pedestrians

HEY Llewyn

A couple of people glance around none of ther aré his focus He pounds along

» HEY

As he nears the object of his pursuit his eyeline drops

Hey Hey Hey
He is hastily crouch-walking now and he reaches forward and scoops—
The Gorfeins’ cat which twists and struggles but only a little as Llewyn tucks him
against his chest
BACK IN THE COFFEESHOP
Llewyn enters with the cat

Llewyn
God damn am one lucky bastard Thank you for

suggesting this place

He glances furtively around then takes his coffee cup off its saucer and pours cream into
it from the silver creamer He sets the cat on the table to feed

j 48
Thing can’t have eaten since yesterday it’s a damn housecat

Jean watches the cat lap milk Llewyn pets it and it pushes back against his hand purring
as it continues to lap milk

Do you know his name I can’t remember its name

i

Jean i
I don’t know its name I barely know the Gorfeins
Llewyn
Jesus Thank God Good kitty Well—where were we
All the acrimony is spent The exchange is matter-of-fact

Jean
You were calling me a careerist And I was calling you a a
loser
Llewyn -

Right Well Those are your categorics

Jean
No—those are your categories

Llewyn
Ya know in my experience the world is divided into two —
kindsof people ‘Those who divide the world into two
categories—-

Jean
—anhd losers

FOLLOWING THE CAT

We follow at floor level as the cat pads through Al Cody’s apartment When it reaches a
table leg it leaps up out of frame

We cut up as it lands on the table It pads onto a pile of mail starting to disarrange it
until Llewyn hooks its belly with one hand and dumps it back on the floor

Llewyn
Not your house

He nudges the mail back into a pile as the apartment door opens and Al enters shucking
his coat Llewyn’s look has caught on the mail

Llewyn
Who’s Arthur Milgram

Al
That’s me Gonna change it legally At some point
What’s up with the cat

Llewyn

SUBWAY CAR

Llewyn sits in the middling-crowded car cat hugged to his chest staring vacantly down
mentally chewing body moving with the motion of the car At length hé shrugs away his
thought whatever it was and his look drifts

It catches on something

A straphanging businessman is looking at him Is it the same one he saw going
downtown from the Gorfeins’

INSIDE AN ELEVATOR

The same operator is holding the throttle down in the Gorfeins’ ‘elevator looking
suspiciously behind him as the floors slip by outside the gate Llewyn is standing at the
back of the cab holding the cat securely against his s chest We hear a fist tapping

THE GORFEINS’ DOOR

As it swings open to reveal a short bespectacled middle-aged man ina cardi gan

Mitch
There’s the cat

It spills out of Llewyn’s arms and runs into the apartment Mitch hugs Llewyn

Receptive chuckles from the little audience
Llewyn starts playing and singing “Dink’s Song”
The small group listens genuinely taken with the performanc
As Llewyn begins the second verse Lillian Gorfein cases in a high sweet harmony
Llewyn stops playing
“Llewyn

Whatare you doing

The spell is broken The little audience is puzzled Lillian is lost

Llewyn

Lillian

This is bullshit I don’t do this I do this for a living —

parlor game

Mitch

Walla of protestation calls for calm from Mitch Joe Marty Green—cut short by a
scream

Everyone freezes looking to where Lillian exited
A still beat
Lillian rushes in holding the cat up face-out by its front paws

Lillian

A staring beat Mitch’s mouth hangs open

BLACK

FADE IN

A point-of- “view through a windshield moving down a Village street Slushy grey early
morning A figure is waiting at the curb guitar case and small bag at his feet holding a
cat to his chest

Cut outside as we pull up

The car is a big four-door The driver is an all-American youngman godd-looking
although something not quite right about his face makes him léss than d matinee idol His

blond hair is combed back in a pompadour The stub of a cigarette hangs fiom his lip

Llewyn looks in the back seat A large man ina fedora is very still inside either asleep
or passed out Next to him are two canes with silver animal knobs

The pompadourcd driver though he has stopped for Llewyn seems to be ignoring him
Llewyn holds up his guitar case

Llewyn
Trunk

Driver
It’s full

He jerks his thumb toward the back seat

Llewyn opetis the back door and stows the case upright carefull not to disturb the—
sleeping—fatman He has a goatee and sunglasses He has a feather in his broad-
brimmed fedora and an animal fetish tie pin His french cuffs are secured with bangles
Llewyn gingerly-shuts the door and climbs in front

The driver puts the car in gear and starts driving

Llewyn somewhat bewildered looks at the wordless driver—white t-shirt leather
jacket—staring out at the road Llewyn looks back at the big man in the back seat whose

body now joggles with the motion of the car

Llewyn turns back to the driver
Llewyn
Hello
The driver’s eyes stay on the road
Driver
Yeah heya
COUNTRYSIDE

Some time later

Llewyn is vacant nodding looking out

Elaborate gagging and wake-snarfling noises from the back seat draw hk attention

The man in back stirs smacks his lips looks around

He sces the guitar case

Roland Turner

lip though it seems to be the same length

Llewyn looks back at Roland Turner

Roland Turner stares at him

understanding from Chano Pozzo in New Orleans You say youll
mess me up don’t have to make those childish threats I
just do my thing I do my thing and one day you wake up
wondering why do I have this pain in my side I stretch
and eat right and I take warm baths but it just won’t go
away this pain why is that Or-maybe it won’t even be
that specific depends maybe it’s just Why is nothing
going right for me Doesn’t matter what I do it just won’t
come out I just can’t make anything come out right My
life is a big bowl of shit I don’t remember making this big
bowl of shit And meantime Roland Turner is somewhere
a thousand miles away laughing his ass off That’s what

happens

A beat
Think about that Elwyn - In this car bad manners won’t

GAS STATION

Roland Turner is herky-jerking away into the background

Johnny Five is once again in the-driver’s seat Llewyn in the passenger seat Llewyn’s
look shifts from the receding jazzman to Johnny Five

Llewyn
Bum a cigarette

Johnny Five
I’m out

Roland Turner recedes clack-clack clack-clack

LATER

Tire chirp as the car pulls out of the station

INSIDE

Roland Turner asleep drooling

-Llewyn in the passenger seat is looking at
Johnny Five driving A cigarette burns on his lower lip

Llewyn
You a musician

A faint smile curls Johnny Five’s lip After a beat

Johnny Five
I act

Llewyn
In talkies

LATER

Same driving configuration Roland Turner still asleep

We seem to have caught Johnny Five-in a long beat between thoughts the shrugs pulls
the cigarette from his lip and stubs it out

He exhales smoke
His eyes remain on the road as he speaks

Three weeks on that show Coulda been more Cops

A beat while Llewyn waits for him to elaborate but he doesn’t Llewyn prompts

Llewyn
How come

omen net gti

He hoists himself with a grunt and clacks away across the nearly deserted restaurant

LLEWYN AT THE REGISTER
The cash register’s ring-open hits the cut
A waitress takes Llewyn’s cash and makes change

Llewyn
How far are we from Chicago

Waitress
Three hours A little more this weather
TABLE
Johnny Five sits alone elbow on table and hand upextended thumb propped against his
temple and burning cigarette wedged between two fingers He stares with a quizzical
expression at the book he once again reads His mouth hangs open

Llewyn is arriving back at the table Hedgops some change on the tabletop

Johnny Five
Ha haha ha hat

With his eyes still on the book Johnny Five’s mirth mellows into a smile The smile
slowly fades His mouth once-again hangs open as he reads on

Llewyn looks at the empty throw of restaurant

MEN’S ROOM
Llewyn enters

A clean empty fairly high-ceilinged bathroom with a long row of urinals and a long row
of stalls

Roland Turner’s legs are visible beneath the door of one the nearer stalls

Mindful of privacy Llewyn goes a few stalls over and bumps its door open

INSIDE THE STALL
Llewyn lowers himself into close shot
He sits for a beat waiting for things to develop
His eyes idly shift His look catches on something
Grafitti on the partition wall
What are you doing
Llewyn gazes at it

There is the sound of slithering fabric ending with a flop-thump that echoes on the tile

Llewyn frowns He starts to rise i

BATHROOM

Llewyn emerges from his stall and goes to the other occupied stall Roland Turner is
partly visible lying on the floor Part of an arm is visible coat off sleeve pushed up
Fi

hose wrapped ‘

He is face-up head toward us so that the top half of his face is visible He is unconscious
eyes rolled up-sheened with sweat He twitches

DOOR

Banging inatthe cut
Llewyn’ reenters the bathroom leading Johnny Five
Roland Turner is twitching more violently

Llewyn i
You stay with him I’ call an ambulance i

Johnny Five unconcerned flicks the match with which he has lit a fresh cigarette

Johnny Five
Nah he’s fine

He goes for the body

Grab his sticks

RESTAURANT

Johnny Five has one of Roland Turner’s arms draped over his shoulder and is helping
him—all but hauling him—toward the door Llewyn follows with his canes

CAR

Johnny Five is easing Roland Turner into the back seat

The displaced cat walks circles around the part of the seat still unoccupied

Llewyn dumps in the canes with a clatter

The door is slammed shut

DRIVING

Johnny Five gazes out driving one-handed cigarette on his lip

His freehand fiddles the radio knob

Very intermittent headlight-bys accompanied by the whoosh of tires on wet asphalt
Whining static hisses into music as Johnny finds a live station

The thud of our car’s wheels on road seams

Llewyn eases his head back against the headrest

Johnny Five starts humming along with a pop song

FADE OUT PICTURE AND SOUND
IN BLACK
A silent beat broken by a sharp thwack-thwack metal against glass
Close on Lilewyn opening his eyes
The car is parked It is still night

Llewyn looks to his left

Johnny Five is also stirring Past him a sweep of light ends withanother shwack a
flashlight rapping against the driver’s window

Johnny rolls it down Our view from the passenger’s side cropsithe head of the leather-
jacketed cop standing outside

The wheels of a passing car whoosh by behind the cop we are lower i the roadbed
pulled off on a shoulder

The cop shines his light into Johnny Fives face i

Voice j

What’ re you doing i

Johnny Five recoils from thelight
a Johnny Five

What We’re just—

cts Voice i

“-n€an’tstop here

Johnny Five

20 § just pulled over to rest a minute

Voice i
Are you inebriated

Llewyn
He’s not drunk

The cop briefly dips his head and shines the flashlight in at Llewyn

Cop
I didn’t ask you You get out of the car
Johnny Five
Me
Cop

You Get out of the car
Johnny Five opens the door gets out

Cop
C’mere

The cop grabs him by the upper arm

I want you to walk this—
From Llewyns point-of-view Johnny Five shakes the hand off The two torsos are
taked by a twirl of white light as the flashlight is dropped A confusion of body parts as
the officer regrabs Johnny and Johnny violently swings his arm away Johnny’s body is
spun and slammed into the car chest-firs irst
Llewyn recoils at the impact

Johnny’s arms are being twisted behind his back He is yanked away

Llewyn’s look follows view half-obscured by car body and sleeping Roland Turner in
the back seat

Johnny is frogmarched ‘hands cuffed behind his back toward and past the headlights of a
car parked behind ‘Itsslowly tuming gumball light sketchily shows the cop opening the
back door putting his‘hand on top of Johnny’s head to sit him in then climbing in front

After a beat the siren fires up and the police car lurches into gear and bumps up onto the
road spitting shoulder gravel It hangs a hard U-turn

Red tail lights grow smaller The siren recedes
Llewyn’s look shifts from back window to back seat
Roland Turner sleeps on breathing softly sweating lightly

The disturbed cat walks back and forth on the seat
The whoosh of another car-by

Llewyn’s look wanders forward

The ignition no key

Llewyn looks around not for anything in particular He shakes his hea
A still beat thinking

He decides

He opens his door gets out closes the door

He opens the back door gets out his guitar and bag hesitates
The cat is seated now looking up at him

Beat

Llewyn closes the door

He mounts the shoulder to the road

Sparse traffic both ways Headlights hit him from front from back Th
his breath vaporizing

He takes a few steps in the direction the parked car was pointed glances back

Wide a car pulls over on a highway shoulder Llewyn emerges pulls his guitar and bag

from the back seat

Ne

Down from the shoulder a little ditch separates highway from broad weedy verge
Further still is a service road and on it a CTA bus terminus fenced-in lot with a bus
shelter outside of it

Wind blows The verge is patched with old snow

The car pulls away and Llewyn goes down the shoulder wades into the grass clogging
the ditch tries to hop and jump over the lowest point

We hear a liquid squush

Llewyn
Goddamnit

He comes grimacing up the other side
Goddamn Shit Fuck

He looks down at shoes and cuffs soaked through
Goddamn piss

He crunches across crusted snow patches toward the bus stop

BUS INTERIOR
Llewyn is one of two Passengers‘in the parked bus
Suddenly itspublic addresssounds

The driver talking into his handset says something about the route unintelligible through
the PA

The other passenger sits reading a newspaper not listening

The driver muscles the door shut and puts the bus in motion

LATER

Through the window at Llewyn The bus is now crowded The window reflection shows
downtown Chicago
CHOCK FULL O’ NUTS COUNTER

Foreground body parts of more men in suits

CLOCK

Echoing interior

A big institutional clock 1215

Llewyn sits into frame side-on onto a tall-backed wooden bench eyes up at the clock
He leans his head back against the wooden back closes his eyes

After a beat a commuter sits into frame in the foreground

Commuter
You hear that about the South Bend train

Llewyn opens his eyes

What Llewyn
at

Commuter
You hear that announcement How long is it delayed

Llewyn
No Don’t know

The man rises and leaves

Llewyn closes his eyes again

Soft in the background a man in a blue uniform is looking at Llewsynt k moment of
hesitation then he walks toward us and Llewyn grow ig sharper but head cropping out
the top of frame

It is late afternoon Llewyn goes to the front door and tries it It is locked

He rattles it then drops his bag and cups his hands at the window totry to see in

He steps back looks to either side
BACK OF CLUB

There is a stagé door Llewyn pushes on it it gives

INTERIOR CLUB
The house is dark Llewyn has entered from just off a little stage

Llewyn
Hello

There is an office door ajar in back A young man sticks his head out

Man
Hello
Llewyn

Man

The person disappears back into the office
Llewyn looks around a little lost He projects

Llewyn
Can wait here

From inside the office

Voice
Sure Maybe an hour

LATER

Llewyn has one of the chairs down off a table and his guitar out and is playing idling
The scrape of the stage door Llewyn stops playing

Bud Grossman enters stamping off snow He has a nice coat i
He walks toward the back past Llewyn noticing him but not interested

Llewyn perhaps waiting for Bud Grossman to speak first now watches him pass and
disappear into the back office

Murmur of voices
Llewyn leans the guitar against the table picks up his bag and goes ‘to the office door

Bud Grossman and the young man we saw earlier look up from their coitversation

Bud Grossman
Getting any money out of Mel

Liewyn

The faintest smile fades He shrugs

Okay Let’s hear something

Bud Grossman sits near the front of the mostly-dark house
Llewyn looks at him looks at the guitar A beat i

Llewyn

He fihishes the song

He look out at Bud Grossman
Bud Grossman has yet to show any reaction to anything i
A good beat and then

Bud Grossman

Llewyn keeps éye contact and does not display emotion either

At length

Llewyn
Okay

Another beat Bud Grossman doesn’t get up neither does Llewyn
Okay That’s it
Bud Grossman shrugs a What else would there be

Bud Grossman
You’re okay You’re not green

Llewyn nods at the compliment such as it is He hesitates then

Llewyn
But I don’t have what say Troy Nélson has

For the first-time Bud Grossman seems pleasantly interested

Bud Grossman
You know Troy

Llewyn
Yeah

Bud Grossman
Good kid (nods thoughtfully) Good kid

Llewyn rises Bud Grossman continues
Yeah he connects with people

Bud Grossman watches Llewyn stowing his guitar
Look I’m putting together a trio Two guys and a girl
singer Youre no front guy but if you can grow a goatee
stay out of the sun we might see how your voice works

with the other two Comfortable with harmonies

Llewyn
No Yes but no had a partner
Bud Grossman

Uh-huh well that makes sense My suggestion Get ba¢k

together

Llewyn
That’s good advice Thank you Mr Grossman ‘

SNOW-PATCHED VERGE

The bus terminal is in the background A very low very weak Brayed- -qut sun hangs at
the horizon The wind blows hard

Llewyn is negotiating the ditch coming toward the foreground highway guitar across his
back and bag in hand

SAME PLACE

Several minutes later

Now dusk some ambient light but the cars s all have headlights on It hasistarted to snow

A car pulls over to where Llewyn stands with his thumb out A crew-cut college-age
youth leans over to rolf down ‘the Passenger window and look up at him

ny at Youth
‘Whereyou going

vs Llewyn
New York

Youth
Maan that’s great I’m going home to New Jersey I have
not slept—you drive right

Llewyn i
Yeah i

Youth i

Well as long as you drive and let me sleep we can do it all
the way man Put your cello in back

Llewyn opens the back door to stow his gear The youth unstraps his seatbelt and slides
over to the passenger side

You’re not gonna try to talk tome
Llewyn
No Just show me the knob for the windshield wipers
FULL NIGHT

A point-of-view heavier snow swirls into headlights and sticks-soft anddark to the
foreground windshield The wipers beating a soporific thid-thud take‘it away

Passenger seat the crew-cut youth asleep Regular heavy breathing
Llewyn driving Bedraggled
Llewyn looks around the dash locates and reaches

The radio goes on The tuner is thumbed through static hiss Coming through it finally
distant music Knob-fiddling cannot makeclear More exploring Radio off

Llewyn blinks himself more awake He react to something he sees

Hinging point-of-view of apprdachit ‘sign it marks the turnoff for Cleveland

Llewyn’s head turns as he tracks the sign His eyes shift in the direction of the sign’s
arrow F

A glow through the snow of distant city lights

Back to Llewyn His eyes hold on the ghost of the city for a brief beat then shift back
forward

He drives

FADE OUT

LATER

Still snowing

As he drives Llewyn sings half aloud “Ladies of Spain”
A glance over at

The youth still sleeping deeply

A look back forward—and a startled reaction
Almost as soon as we see it movement in the headlights is lost below tb hood
Impact thud Squeal of brakes i

Llewyn rocks forward at the hard brake and so does the youth ‘who then flops back His
deep breathing continues undisturbed ’ i

Llewyn takes a wide-eyed moment He looks around through the back window

Nothing is visible outside except dimly falling snow

Llewyn opens his door

EXTERIOR
Driver’s side headlight in the foreground Blood on the bumper

qd
Llewyn is walking into the foreground to look A looking beat He recedes into the
background on

He stands behind the idling car looking at the highway behind

No traffic peaceful dark falling snow Nothing visible on the road

‘Something catches his eye i
Movement perhaps thirty yards back off the shoulder a small animal
Llewyn squints against snow

A badger- or ferret-sized creature is hauling itself haltingly toward the woods that line the
highway Before we get a good look at it it disappears into the dark of the trees

On Llewyn looking

CAR INTERIOR

Llewyn sits in

The engine rumbles in park
The wipers thud

The youth breathes in and out

After a beat Llewyn puts the car in gear

EXTERIOR
Locked-down the car pulls away from us into the background Tail lights recede leave
us in falling snow
SUBWAY CAR
Loud train clatter bangsin at the cut
No time of day we aife underground Llewyn sits in a mostly empty car still with guitar
and bag and still—judging by his unrclieved haggard look—sleepless
CLOSE ONLLEWYN ASLEEP
Early morning—somewhere
Llewyn emerges from peaceful sleep He roils onto his back looking up
Cottage-cheese ceiling underlit by light leaking around a curtain
Liewyn rises to an elbow looks around orienting himself
Acchild’s room He is in a child’s bed

A plastic red-framed something on the nightstand at his elbow he picks it up
An Etch-a-Sketch Written on it in the spidery way permitted by the deWice

Welcome Uncle Llewyn

EXTERIOR

Morning Llewyn emerges from his sister’s Queens house

GREAT HALL

Cut in with a crash of echoing walla It is the interior hall of a once-grand beaux-art
institution gone to seed ‘

class than bureaucrat

INSIDE ROOM

As Llewyn enters with guitar case

Llewyn
Hiya

Hugh Davis sits by the window not looking out He does look up at Llewyn’s entrance

The other occupant of the room on the bed further from the window is mostly hidden
by acurtainion a ceiling ring We see only his slippered feet

Llewyn setsidown his guitar and swings a chair around to face his father
How’s it going
No answer but none it seems is expected

Taking off Pop Won’t see you for a while shipping
out

His father’s look rests upon him not with much expression

A beat of looking at each other

Llewyn rises not uncomfortable to look out the rib-height window
Try something new

He looks out for a beat
see mean something old

His point-of-view parking lot some marshy grass ocean

He shrugs looking out He sits back down

How’s it going

The old mans eyes have followed him back and forth

Llewyn leans forward to unclasp the guitar case He withdraws the guitar
Okay here’s this You used to like this

He limbers his fingers briefly then plays and sings “Ladies of Spain”

The old man watches him sing Once even his eyes shift to look at the guitar
fingering

i
Second verse The old man’s eyes shift dreamily to the window The hold there for a
long beat then return to Llewyn as the song finishes The last chord is held and rings
out The two men look at each other lost it seems in the music as it floats away

A long beat and then from Llewyn softly

Wow
Another silent beat and a more definite
Wow

He looks briefly at John Corsicatto then back at his father

ito lay it gently in its case

He realizes he still holds the guitar and stirs leauter ‘forwat

HALLWAY

Wide looking the length of the hall with zlaring on the linoleum and streaking the
tile walls Llewyn emerges from his father’s room small in the background without the
guitar

Emerged fully into the hall he stops and looks briefly up and down its length

He walks toward us head turning to look into the rooms he passes

Ik as he checks to the side and then stops
A youngblack ordérly is making a bed in an empty room

Llewyn
Excuse me

The man looks up

FRONT OF THE GASLIGHT

Wide on the front of the club as Llewyn stumbles out under impetus from the bartender
and another man

There is the beginnings of a line for the second set Llewyn glares at the onlookers and
as he starts te wander off
STREET

A phone booth seen in wide shot

Llewyn
The show is bullshit Three micks and Grandma Moses

f

Wind blows traffic goes by

Llewyn is a small figure in the booth not on the phone but looking ‘down motionless
studying something held in one hand ue

We jump in as he reaches for it with his other hand his open address book The hand
turns the page lingers for a moment turns again

APARTMENT DOOR SWINGING OPEN

able to hug Llewyn

Llewyn

He breaks the embrace looking off

A white Persian cat has trotted in

LATER
Llewyn plops down onto the study couch Lights are off The apartment is quiet

He digs into pockets to empty them onto the nightstand Coins and tokens from one
pocket His wallet from another He pokes through the bill compartment six dollars

He shakes his head dumps it on the nightstand
LATER STILL
Close on Llewyn eyes closed on his back the regular breathing of deep sleep

After a long beat a soft thud and a “Huh” of surprise from Llewyn as his body tenses
and his eyes) fly open

After a moment to register where he is he looks down his body

Close on the cat standing on his chest looking back at him purring loudly

NEXT MORNING
Looking down the dim hall towardsthe less dim study
Llewyn’s head peeks out

i Llewyn
Hello

No answer

He emerges to walk down the hallway in his undies

COMMON HALLWAY
Outside the apartment door

Llewyn emerges dressed and takes care with one foot to keep the cat hemmed in the
apartment as‘he exits

STREET

Llewyn is walking After a beat his attention is caught by something to one side He
slows looking and stops

His point-of-view an illustration of a housecat On either side of it is a dog The three
pets are out in the wild

Llewyn looking

Wider point-of-view the illustration is a poster in a movie-theater lightbox thetheater
not yet open

It is a poster for The Incredible Journey The tag line promises A Fi fantastic True-Life
Drama

As Llewyn stares music fades in Llewyn himself perfortning “Pye Been All Around
This World”
CLUB

The music is a pre-lap of Llewyn in The Gaslight spotlit as at the beginning of the
movie

He finishes the song to applause
Llewyn
Thank ‘you Youve probably heard that one before but
what the hell

He rises to go but dips back into the mike

If it was never new and it never gets old then it’s a
folk song

As the applause abates something catches Llewyn’s attention
Nick Porco nods Llewyn over He is broadly smiling

Nick
Boy you were some mess last night

Llewyn
Yeah sorry Nick 1’m an asshole

Nick
Oh I don’t give a shit I even agree about the music
Funny to hear you say it though

Liewyn
Yeah I’m a funny guy

Nick
Svery true Anyways someone wants to see you out back

7 Liewyn
Who

Nick
Guy in a suit

A clatter offscreen attracts Lilewyns attention

Backlit in the smoky spotlight a youngman with a dutch-boy cap and a guitar and a
harmonica on a rack is just sitting down onthe stool onstage

He blows a couple times on the-harmonica

BACK ALLEY

The steel dogr ‘of the’club swings open and Llewyn emerges The man waiting against
the wall i oe

7 Man
You a funny boy huh

What Llewyn
at

The man tosses his cigarette away and pushes himself off the wall

Man
Had to open ya big mouth funny boy

Llewyn
Had to—what It’s what I do Fora living Who’re—

Man

Llewyn

I’m sorry what I’m—oof
The man has just socked him in the mouth

Man

Llewyn is holding his mouth

Llewyn
Oh for Christ’s sake You yell stuff it’s a’ show

Man
Ain’t a fuckin fag show

He hits him again
Wasn’t your show
He hits him again and Llewyn goes down in the slush of the alleyway

Llewyn
It’s not the opera jackass

He kicks Llewyn curls into a defensive ball and bellows from behind protective
forearms

Llewyn
It’s a fucking baskethouse

The man kicks again

Man
We leavin this fuckin cesspool You kin have it smartass

More kicking

Yellin yer crap when my wife is up there tryin to sang And there was
a record man there ya fuckin fag I took her home cryin

As the kicking and Llewyn’s reaction abates we can hear the performer inside the club
It is Bob Dylan performing “I Was Young When I Left Home”

The man is striding down the alley

Llewyn stays balled up for along moment Once he is certain no more kicks are
coming he begins slowly and painfully to straighten out exploring tender places with
one hand

The man has disappeared around the alley corner

Llewyn rises experimentally to a crouch straightens a little more He takes a few
uneven steps toward the mouth of the alley one hand brushing the wall for balance

Near the mouth of the ailey he sinks back down to seated position back against the wall
looking down the street in the direction the man exited

The man is halfway down the block Heraises his hand and whistles down an oncoming
cab He climbs in

After a short beat the cab starts moving again
As it passes the mouth of the alley Llewyn touches two fingers to his forehead in salute
Llewyn
Au revoir
i
The cab is Past
Its tail lights recede
t

Cut to black
