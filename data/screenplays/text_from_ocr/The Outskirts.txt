the ill-fated celestial paradise of
Eden the apple seeds of discontent
had taken root and were already

their own kids to live out their
fantasies or sleeping with some
tool for an extra minute of screen

And anyway like youre one to talk

HERB
Whats that supposed to mean

JODI

Hey age is just a number

JODI
That closely correlates with death

Point taken

HERB
So you want me to date

between us throughout the years but
were seniors now and theres no
reason we cant put all that behind
us and finish out the school year
being civil to each other

Whitney scrutinizes them Mindy and Jodi shift uncomfortably

MINDY (CONTD)
We thought maybe if we came and spoke
to you like adults we could come to
some sort of mutually beneficial
agreement

A long beat Jodi looks like shes about to throw up

WHITNEY
Wow No ones ever had the courage
to come talk to me face to face

Mindy gives Jodi a dorky thumbs up A beat Whitney nods

Whitney and her crew hang in the back of Colins Suburban
drinking beers Dave silently nurses his beer

MACKENZIE
Did you guys see Jodis locker
Someone did something with a piccolo
and a Paddington Bear that is
really not right

DAVE
That was seriously twisted Whitney
Even for you I mean how mental do
you have to be to put in that much
effort into messing with a couple of
nerds just trying to make peace

WHITNEY
What do you mean All I had to do
was get Jodi to respond to a spyware
email figure out her IP address
and learn how to hack into a webcam
After that it was just going through
the 84 hours of footage to edit
together the best bits

DAVE
Heres an idea Why dont you just
leave them alone
WHITNEY
Because Dave if I left them alone
it would make me look weak And I
will not allow that creepy giant and
her frizzy-haired lapdog to roam the
halls of this school thinking that
for one second they are my equal

Mackenzie holds up the 48 Laws of Power

MACKENZIE
Law 15 -- crush your enemy totally

DAVE
You know Im so glad Im not a girl
and its not just because of your
plumbing and status in society
Its because girls are demonic
Youre like medieval to each other

PRITHI
Oh shut up Guys are just as bad

DAVE
No Freaking Way When a dude
has a problem with another dude you
know what he does

(to Colin)
Sorry I punched you We cool

Colin nods through his pain Dave turns back to Whitney

DAVE (CONTD)

behind in education employment and
financial status

advanced society with spaceships

MACKENZIE
Im going to cut right to the chase
I intend to rule this school next
year but the only way you become
the best is by working for the best
I thought that was Whitney But
apparently I was wrong I cant say
I think much of your fashion choices
but I think youve got a lot to teach
me and Id like to offer my services
as your intern for the rest of the
school year

A beat then Mindy shakes her head in disgust and walks away
EXT WHITNEYS TRAILER PARK - DAY

Jodi rides her bike up to a trailer She stops not sure
how to proceed She turns looking around the yard and sees --

Whitney sits alone in a broken gutted car Jodi approaches
Whitney glances at her then turns away

JODI
Look I want to apologize I didnt
know Mindy was going to do that

WHITNEY
Whatever Fine

Jodi tries to join her in the car but the passenger door is
rusted shut Jodi climbs into the open back seat She looks
around noting their odd configuration

JODI
(in Miss Daisy voice)
Mr Coburn wont you take me to the
Garden Club for a mint julep

Whitney just shoots her a withering look Jodi smiles weakly

JODI (CONTD)
I never meant for things to go down
like that

WHITNEY
Oh come on Dont tell me you arent
loving this

JODI
Fair enough But look on the bright
side Its all out in the open now
Nobody likes having to carry around
secrets Right So in a way now
youre free

WHITNEY
And cue violins

JODI
Look lets not forget that you did
pretty much the same thing to me
And did I go into hiding

WHITNEY
Yeah but look at your wardrobe
Your bar for humiliation was already
so high

Jodi just shakes her head and moves to get out
WHITNEY (CONTD)
No wait
(Jodi pauses)

She chokes on her own words
JODI
Were you just trying to apologize

CARMEN

MINDY (VO)
As I sat there listening I realized
how ridiculous it all was -- bickering

over who was going to be prom king
of a school that three months ago
they couldnt wait to leave We had
pretended we cared about coming
together but in the end it had all
been a lie and everyone only cared
about themselves

(MORE )

MINDY (VO) (CONTD)
Which was fitting since when you
think about it most of high school
is a lie Everyone faking it trying
to act cooler or older or smarter or
just more sure of themselves than
they really are And I couldnt
help but think wouldnt it be nice
for once if people just told the
truth

INT MERCEDES EXT SCHOOL - DAY
Mindy sits in a tinted out black on black Mercedes SUV

MINDY
And thats the plan

Mackenzie sits next to her in the drivers seat

MACKENZIE
So youre going to drug prom

MINDY
Its not a drug Its just a very
mild form of a truth serum in gaseous

form Think of it like a smart
persons version of spiking the punch

MACKENZIE
Im totally fine with you drugging
prom
Gee great Mackenzie glances at Mindy
MACKENZIE (CONTD)
So what changed your mind about
working with me

desire And thus the only way to
end suffering is to end desire
But the illogical and futile nature
of desire will inevitably win out
over our rational natures So were
doomed to suffer

JODI
Well Im sorry Mindy but I dont
have to tell you every single thing

MINDY
Yes you do Youre supposed to be
my best friend

JODI
What did you want me to do Just
tag along with you forever Why
couldnt you just be happy for me

MINDY
Because you lied to me And because
you were too busy trying to make out
with your new brother to even notice
when I needed you You knew how
much MIT meant to me

JODI
Hes not my brother And Im sorry
that for once in my life I had a boy
who I thought was totally awesome
actually like me back --

DAVE
You think Im totally awesome

She turns to him suddenly a bit shy

JODI
Yeah

DAVE
Cool

She turns right back to Mindy yelling again --

JODI
And Im really sorry that for once
in your life things didnt go
perfectly but suck it up and deal
with it like the rest of us And by
the way I looked it up and Pakistan
has a Prime Minister and a President

Mindy considers this a moment in disbelief then resumes --

MINDY
Screw you Jodi All those times
Whitney picked on you because you
couldnt keep your mouth shut I was
right there alongside you I did
all of this for you And then you
just walked away from me

Jodi regards her not sure what to say

WHITNEY
Are you guys going to make out now

Jodi reels on her

JODI
You know what Whitney Shut up I
tried to defend you Even after all
the horrible crap you put me through
I still tried because I was stupid
enough to feel bad for you

Whitney scoffs

WHITNEY
Do you really think that for one
second I actually cared what these
people thought of me High school
is over Im getting the hell out
of here away from these morons and
never looking back I just wanted
you two to know before we all left
that Id won That I will always
win And that whenever I want I
can take away that which you hold
most dear and crush it

Jodi and everyone just stare at her That was intense

CLAIRE
That bitch crazy

Sugar just nods in agreement

WHITNEY

And it barely took any push at all
to turn you two into Cain and Abel
Frankly I think I did you a favor
Otherwise this little horror show
likely would have dragged on for
another few years before you two
just cut your losses and moved on

Jodi and Mindy regard each other deflated A beat

JODI
Maybe shes right

Mindy scoffs hurt and angry

JODI (CONTD)
It was stupid to think that wed
stay friends after high school
Were both going to go off and do
our own thing make new friends
start new lives and in ten years
well see each other at the reunion
and well smile and say hi Maybe
thats how its supposed to be

MINDY
If thats really how you see it
then I guess we should just cut our
losses now

JODI
It is how I see it

Mindy just nods in hurt resignation They stand looking at
each other -- this is the end Whitney looks on victorious

Jodi turns to go Dave follows Everyone starts to disperse
Claire Sugar and Virginia look on sadly from the side

MINDY
I disappointed you I disappointed
everyone

MR SAMUELS
Im not saying its okay what you
did but I understand Its hard
feeling like youre giving your best

heres a guy who went to MIT and
hes wasting his life with a bunch
of kids who could care less about
science But heres the thing -- I
love my job And I love getting to
work with a student like you who
has all the potential in the world
There are always going to be jerks
That doesnt change after high school
And you can spend your life trying
to beat them or prove them wrong or
get even with them but its just
wasted energy The important thing
is figuring out whats important to
you and fighting for that The rest
doesnt matter

Mindy takes this in She nods appreciative

MINDY
