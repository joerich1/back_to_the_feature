INT GOTHIC CHURCH 1000 AM ST PATRICKS DAY
DOWNTOWN BOSTON

As we open we see the inside of an enormous church A young

looking PRIEST in his mid-thirties is finishing the delivery
of the Lordâ€™s Prayer In the back of the church in the last
pew there are two who kneel on the cold stone floor

They do not stand to sing nor do they offer signs of peace
when told but they pray They grip and rub their rosaries
They mutter their words in Latin

CONNOR and MURPHY MacMANUS (mid-twenties) are shrouded in
thick waist length navy P-coats worn leather boots and the
hungry clothes of the poor The boys heads are shaved and
they have facial hair

MONSIGNOR
(dismissing young
priest)

Thank you Father Macklepenny for
coming all the way across town to be
our guest speaker today I hope you
found our little parish to your
liking

Macklepenny takes his seat on the alter along side the regular
priests of the church The MacManus brothers suddenly stand
as all others remain seated Each church goer between them
and the aisle shifts hisher position to allow the boys
passage as if on command The two turn and begin to stride
for the alter eyes down determined
ANNABELLE MACMANUS
(thick Irish accent)
Theyve never been like anyone else
From the moment they were born of

(VO)

the same womb on the same
just had their own way my
And I always knew that one
would do something of true
I just never expected they

day they
boys did
day they
greatness
would

bring about such a such a
reckoning

The MacManus brothers are fraternal twins As Annabelle
MacManus speaks Macklepenny is taken aback as he scans the
congregation amazed to find that he is the only one who thinks
this out of the ordinary

The monsignor begins his sermon Macklepenny rises to stop
the boys from this disgraceful disturbance

The elder clergyman finds Macklepennys arm keeping him
seated while shaking his head Macklepennys confusion gives
way to awe as he watches the brothers step onto the altar
brush by the six seated priests and approach the enormous

crucifix
They both fall to their knees and kiss the feet of Christ
They rise and as abruptly as they came they turn and head
back down the aisle for the front door They stop at the
rear of the church turning to listen to the sermon
MONSIGNOR
(loud authoritative)

and I am reminded of this holy
day of the sad story of Kitty
Geneviese This poor soul cried out
time and time again for help but no
person answered her calls Though
many saw not one so much as called
Her assailant wiped the bloody knife
off on her lifeless little body
They watched as he simply walked
away Nobody wanted to get involved
Nobody wanted to take a stand We
must fear evil men and deal with
them accordingly but what we must

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
truly guard against what we must
fear most

(beat)
Is the indifference of good men

The MacManuses turn and walk out the door
EXT CHURCH STEPS SUNNY MORNING

The boys put on their dark glasses and pause at the top of
the steps to light up their cigarettes They both roll their
cigarette butts along their tongues and screw them into their
lips In this unique way they light up seemingly oblivious
to their synchronicity and mimic

CONNOR
(Irish accent)
I do believe the Monsignor finally
got a point

MURPHY
(Irish accent)
Aye

They leave
INT NOLANDS MEAT PACKING PLANT 400 PM SAME DAY

Murphy wearing a white blood soaked smock and apron stands
around the corner of the entrance to the loading dock He
grips a gigantic bloody slab of meat and smirks Connor
flips his cigarette out the loading dock and passes his
brothers hiding place He notices the workers have stopped
and are looking at him

CONNOR
What

Murphy slaps Connor square in the face with the bloody slab

Connors face is caked with blood as he stands stunned He
then leaps on Murphy sending him into a pile of nearby
hamburger He grabs a large cow tongue from a nearby heap
and begins slapping Murphy in the face with it as they both
laugh and the workers cheer

Their boss McGERKIN approaches with a very large woman

Her head is clean-shaven The two are still laughing out of
breath they turn

MCGERKIN
Boys this is Rose Baum Gurtle

CONNOR
(taken aback)
Okay then lets get ya started

Connor exits with Roz

MURPHY
Christ thats the largest woman

MCGERKIN

big fat angry lesbians wont think

MCGERKIN
Hey those people can shut ya down
Theyll sue you into the ground
claiming they were put under mental

INT NOLANDS MEAT PACKING PLANT CUT STATION SAME DAY

who are cutting meat as it goes by on assembly

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
CONNOR
Okay just cut off as much fat as
you can as it goes by and the rule
of thumb here is

ROZ
Rule of thumb

CONNOR
(questioningly)
Yeah

ROZ
Do you know where that term comes
from In the early 1900s it was
legal for men to beat their wives as
long as they used a stick no wider
than their thumb

Connor holds up his thumb and stares at it

CONNOR
Cant do much damage with that
Perhaps it shoulda been the rule of
wrist Ha
(he elbows her)
Rule of wrist

She returns an icy stare He hands her the knife The co-
workers all seem wary of Roz

Murphy stands on one side of Roz Connor on the other
surrounded by a tight group of workers Everyone is within
ear shot of one another cutting meat as it goes by Knowing
glances are shared by everyone It is an uncomfortable mood

CONNOR
Hey Murphy

MURPHY
Aye

CONNOR

(slight smirk)
How many feminists does it take to
screw in a light bulb

MURPHY
How many

CONNOR
Two One ta screw it in and one ta

piece of meat and turns to Connor She pushes him and starts

She reaches back and punches Connor full force in the face
He takes the hit very well He stops backing up

CONNOR
Why dont you save all your aggression
for protests and marches and what

She suddenly drives her boot into his crotch sending him to
the floor reeling with pain Two female co-workers leap to
his aid

ROZ
You fuckin slaves Kowtowing to the
needs of men Get up Get the fuck

Rozengurtle begins to turn raising her fist to Murphy
Murphy winds up and punches her square in the face She lands

on her back The on-lookers are stunned as he walks over and
stands above her

bag of ice bursts as it hits the floor and spreads across
it He throws the receiver and covers his ears with both

cubes as the boys dive for it screaming The two naked
hysterical boys fumble for the phone flailing on their
stomachs in the field of ice They finally catch it and both
put their ears to the receiver in panic As they scream MA

EXT AN ALLEY MORNING

PAUL SMECKER FBI agent is lead by the Boston Chief of
Police through a jungle of ravenous reporters police lines
and uniformed officers He is impeccably dressed in a deep
red suit He is smiling confident as he walks He is a very
good-looking slender man

He looks intently for a moment at four uniformed officers

They approach two dead bodies laying next to a dented green
dumpster with half the paint job scraped off

One man IVAN CHECKOV lays on his stomach closer to the
dumpster than the other The ass of his pants has been burnt
out and a large cotton bandage is in its place

The other VLADDY has a blood soaked bandage around his

head and is on his stomach as well There are hundreds of
pieces of porcelain of various sizes everywhere Three plain-â€”
clothed homicide detectives DUFFY DOLLY and GREENLY hover
close to the bodies Dolly and Duffy listen to GREENLY an
obvious rookie give his over-confident theory of what took
place

The chief is about to interrupt them but Smecker holds him
back with a smile The two wait and watch in a position
where the unsuspecting detectives have their backs to them

GREENLY

(thick Boston accent)
Sso these guys are just kickin
the shit out of each other This guy

(points to Vladdy)
Picks up an old kitchen sink that
some one threw out and crushes this
guy

(Checkov)
With it All right so it makes a
big bang and alerts their friend
whos standin look out around the
corner So he comes over and gets
into it with this guy

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
(Vladdy )
Hes angry at him right They get
into an altercation in which the
look out guy crushes this guy by
jumpin on him And look at the damage
here

(Vladdy )
I mean this guys fuckin hamburger
man His spine is crushed Hes all
twisted and shit That guy had to be
one big mother fucker Huge 3-400
pounds fuckin huge

Smecker listens
The Chief is embarrassed

GREELY

Or okay Check this out Say these
two dont even know the huge guy
Theyre just staggerin home from a
bar this morning still all fucked
up from St Pattys last night So
they figure theyll take a short cut
down the alley and this big mother
fucker hes just waitin And what
could be more perfect for strong arm
robbery Two drunk guys all bandaged
up Theyre already injured for Christ
sakes He takes a blunt object and
whacks the guy with the bandage on
his head right Cause hes smart
He knows the guy with the bandage on
his ass he aint going nowhere
Matter of fact this guys probably
helping his friend with the rectal
problem along Theyre limping around
like a couple of decrepit old broads
So once this guys out of the picture

(denotes Vladdy)
this poor asshole he tries to run
But look how far he gets fore the
huge bastard catches up with him
Only a few yards And what does he
do He gets creative He picks up a
sink and crushes the poor mother-
fucker Then he aint done yet He
comes over here jumps on this guys
back and crushes him to death

(Vladdy )
He steals their shit and beats it
Thanks for comin out

(beat)
And look at this print

Greenly points out a large foot print on Vladdys back

Some detectives nod in agreement Smecker chuckles as he
shakes his head

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
GREENLY
Thats one big fuckin shoe and
think about it Of all the ways to
kill a guy crushin him to death
Thats very particular You dont
get many of those I dunno I feel
something big here I wouldnt be
surprised if we see more of these

SMECKER

(stepping into the

open)
Brilliant So now we got a Huge guy
theory and Serial crusher theory
Top fucking notch

(to Greenly)
Whats your name

GREENLY
Detective Greenly Who the fuck are
you

Smecker saunters up to Greely and pulls his ID out of the
breast pocket of his sport coat and lets it hang The large
light blue letters FBI can be easily seen

SMECKER
Thats who the fuck I am

All the detectives seem disgruntled and look to the Chief
for an explanation

CHIEF
Listen I gotta go by the numbers on
this one ID just came back on
these guys Theyve got connections
to the Russian mob That makes it a
federal matter and Agent Smecker
here is heading up the investigation
with our full cooperation

GREENLY
(to Chief)
Chief what the fuck is this

SMECKER
Sweet-n-low

Greenly looks helplessly to the Chief who simply nods He
storms off the scene upset Smecker turns his back on
everyone and puts earphones in He reaches down and hits
play The choir song Agnus dei overtakes He begins to
investigate He kneels at the bodies for a moment then stares
at the opposite brick wall He picks up a piece of porcelain
and scrapes it with his thumb

He quickly cocks his head toward the sky and begins to chuckle
as he says Jesus Christ under his breath He brushes some
paraffin on each of the dead mens hands Duffy and Dolly
watch defiantly They start to smile at one another as they
collectively realize his homosexuality He is slightly
effeminate buy not overly fey

SMECKER
(loudly)
Mitchell Langley

Two uniformed officers approach

MITCHELL
Yes sir

SMECKER

See if he has had any complaints of
water coming down in any apartments

The two begin their tasks Chaffey finds a casing near
Checkovs hand hidden under the edge of the pile

CHAFFEY
Got it Its a 45

The homicide detectives are surprised as Chaffey looks for
the second shell Smecker lights up a smoke

SMECKER
Chief could you get ballistics down
here and tell them they have to dig
a 45 slug out of a brick wall

He points to a bullet hole in the opposing and tattered wall
SMECKER
and locate another thats been
fired through a dumpster
He points to another bullet hole at the dumpsters base
CHIEF

world Hes mobile Got all his stuff

INT EMERGENCY ROOM DAY

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
A potent song takes our ears as The MacManus brothers sit in
the ER They have already received care Their faces are
beaten and there are bandages and dried blood in various
spots Connors injuries exceed Murphys They are both clad
in only their leather boots boxer shorts and worn out old
bathrobes

Young kids wait for medical attention as their knife wounds
bleed Two nuns in the corner console a third whose robes
are ripped and face is beaten A woman toward the end of the
hall is so badly beaten she is unrecognizable

As the song builds to a more harrowing chorus a man enters

His clothes suggest hes a pimp He is not injured He looks
around as he stands perturbed at the end of the hall

He reaches over and grabs the beat up woman by the hair and
begins to drag her out She is kicking and screaming from
the floor grabbing at his wrists as he hauls her away

(Slo-mo) The boys instantly furious stand and begin to go
toward the action but Connors legs give out on him and he
falls to the floor Connor still trying to go after the
pimp crawls towards him Murphy helps his brother to his
chair and hold him tight

MURPHY

Okay Just calm down Take it easy
Hell have his day Hell have his

They clink the glasses together throw back the Hennessey
ball up the thick glasses in their fists drop to one knee
and both deliver a devastating blow to each of Checkovs
quads Murphy on the left Connor on the right Hes down
for the count writhing on the floor

The boys each take a Russian guy and start fighting as the
others start kicking and spitting on Checkov This is a bar
brawl lots of punches dont connect Connor dismantles his
man quickly Murphy is still fighting as all the Irish try
to jump in and help Murphy but Connor goes into psycho mode
pushing them all back

CONNOR
Let the boy go He knows what the
fuck hes doing

They all back off and start to cheer him on Murphy and Vladdy
are ripping each other apart Vladdy backs him against a

wall and pulls back exhausted for one good punch Murphy
reaches up behind his head with both hands and pulls two
bottles of wine from a wall rack He swings them toward each
other with Vladdys head as the mid-point The bottles
haphazardly connect one on each side of his head He crumples
to the ground in an explosion of glass and wine

approaches He punches Checkov in the face in complete rage

Two friends subdue him as all chuckle

CONNOR
Now like my fine brother says on

As they cheer Connor lights up his smoke and tosses the
match on Ivans butt

The Hennessey is instantly ablaze and Checkov is screaming
and wiggling in horror Some just stand there stunned but
most of the remaining onlookers leap to Ivans aid They
furiously pat him out and turn on Connor

Boom The door breaks open and in hobbles Checkov and Vladdy
guns drawn Checkov is all beat up and the ass of his pants
is burnt out A bulky bandage covers his buttocks Vladdy
has a large bandage around his head The boys stand in
surprise

Ivan smashes Connor in the forehead with his gun sending
blood gushing down his face as he falls to the floor Murphy
helplessly yells his brothers name as he is brought to his
knees by Vladdy Ivan positions Connor on his knees before
the toilet which is open to the room Checkov puts his foot
on Connors head and proceeds as he struggles to hand cuff
him to the old toilet So now Connor is bleeding and hugging
the commode with his hands cuffed behind the bowl base

CHECKOV

his dead body in the garbage

(looks at this watch)

Checkov walks towards the door and says lets go to Vladdy
MURPHY

t was just a bar fight You guys

Vladdy pulls him to his feet and leads him away following
Checkov

Connor blood running from his face listens to absolute
silence for just a moment Suddenly his face reads the gravity
of the situation In a split second he turns into an animal

Hes yelling pulling tugging and growling

His body is a whirlwind of motion The skin on his wrists
bleeds profusely

EXT ALLEY MORNING

Vladdy and Checkov lead Murphy out back into the alley

(slo-mo) Connor bends his knees and heaves the toilet upward
and swings one arm directly beneath it He is no longer
tethered around the basin He holds it at a cocked angle

The heavy porcelain tank cover slips off the toilet

He tosses the toilet in a left and outwardly trajectory

then he jumps off the sill to the right He is sailing through
the air about twenty feet behind and to the right of the
toilet cuffed hands above his head robe up like a cape
behind him Murphy screams

EXT ALLEY MORNING

(slo-mo) Checkov begins to laugh heartily The tank top lands
pristinely on a garbage bag just behind Murphy Ivans look
turns to one of terror Bam He is crushed by the toilet
Boom His gun goes off punching a hole in the dumpster near
the bottom Vladdy hears the bang and crouches as he turns

to see a wave of tiny porcelain bits

Connor lands squarely on Vladdys back His gun discharges
firing a hole in the brick of the opposing wall He is
savagely crushed against the ground Connor bounces off and
hits the wall landing in the garbage completely unconscious

Murphy takes his hands from his head There is dead silence

He runs to his brother pulls him from the trash and checks
his vital signs He seems okay Vladdy still alive slowly
crawls for his gun inadvertently covering his own bullet
casing Murphy goes over picks up the tank cover and clubs
the man to death with two hard and fast blows then throws
it up and behind him It lands in the dumpster with a
resonating boom

Murphy quickly takes everything from the scene guns money
wallets watches and a pager He shoves it in a garbage bag
and throws Connor over his shoulder and runs out of the alley

A water leak starts on the ceiling It drips faster and
faster The water begins to follow a water damaged crack
along the ceiling It slowly spreads in two directions
The brothers struggle for air in their sleep Then slowly
and at the same time they each reach up one arm apiece and
simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something
Their straining faces are brought from darkness to light as
they sit up quickly face to the ceiling

Their eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath
as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads

of water still fall between them

Smecker and Greenly walk into a large sunken living room

with high ceilings There is a huge white shaped pit couch

in the center with seven dead bodies draped across it All

the bodies have been turned so they are either seated or on
their backs and bright new pennies have been place in their
eyes There is one corpse directly in the middle of the living
room making eight This victim (THE FAT MAN) is overweight
and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood
which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him

The victims body positions are in a circle with the fat man
as the hub Smecker is instantly engulfed The regular
homicide detectives are on hand with their IDs hanging out
of their breast pockets They see Smecker and back off

Duffy wears an especially loud tie Smecker lights up a smoke
He circles around and sees another body behind the couch
which makes nine The victim is on his back with pennies
stuck in his eyes

He was the only one done right Two
in the back of the head

SMECKER
And the pennies

DUFFY
New hitman wants to leave his mark

SMECKER

Thats a possibility Yknow you
Boston cops are perking up Thats
two sound theories in one day neither
of which deal with abnormally sized
men

(pause)
Another possibility is that they
were placed there with religious
intent

DUFFY
Yeah Some cultures still put pennies
in the eyes of the dead or silver

SMECKER
The Greeks The Italians

DUFFY
The Sicilians

Whats the symbology there
Smecker tosses the Idiot glance to Dolly

SMECKER
Symbology Well now that Duffy has
relinquished his King Bone Head crown
I see we have an heir to the throne
Im sure the word you were looking
for was symbolism Whats the
symbolism there Let me explain it
to you In Greek and Roman mythology
when you died you would have to pay
the toll to Charon the boatman who
ferried you across to the gates of
judgment This made sure the dead
came to atone for what they did during
their lives Detective

Smecker looks at his ID

SMECKER
Dollapoppaskalious

The detectives are impressed

DOLLY (DOLLAPOPPASKALIOUS )
Holy shit Youre the first one thats
ever got that

SMECKER
(aside)
Yeah well Im an expert in name-
ology

The detectives chuckle
INT PLAZA HOTEL SUITE LIVING ROOM NIGHT

Smecker is chain smoking His clothes appear unkempt His
eyes show emotion at every new found clue The detectives
watch closely He is hunched over the body of the fat man
probing his wounds with his gloved fingers Greenly has re-
entered He defiantly holds a cup of coffee but is too
intimidated to interrupt Smecker He sets it down and folds
his arms

SMECKER
Ive seen burns like these before
They used silencers Look at these
entry and exit wounds Theyre
identical
He stands up and gives a lesson to the now eager detectives

He points his two index fingers to the back of his own skull

SMECKER
The two bullets went in here through

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
the top of the skull criss-â€”crossed
and exited through the eyeballs

This one clue tells us three distinct
facts Number one Duffy

DUFFY

They shot him at a downward angle
(makes connection)

They put him on his knees

SMECKER
Excellent Number two Greenly

GREENLY
Uh
(thinking hard)
Shit I uh

SMECKER

It tells us that he was the last to
die All these men

(fans across the

corpses with his

hand)
Were carrying They came in dropped
all in seconds and then took their
time with fag man Didnt they
Duffy

(psychotic laugh)
They sure as fuck did

A wide-eyed Duffy joins with Smecker by nodding his head
Smecker is seducing all of them

SMECKER
And number three Dolly

DOLLY
Uh two shooters

SMECKER
Fan-fuckin-tastic

Greenly and Duffy want to know how

SMECKER
Now stay with me boys What did
they do to make two such identical
wounds Did one guy put him on his
knees pop a cap in sit him back up
and shoot him again the same way
No Two men of similar height dropped
this guy down each put some iron to
his head and boom Thats all she
fuckin wrote

DUFFY
What about one guy with two guns

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
SMECKER
Possible but unlikely The angles
are too extreme A guy holding two
guns to the back of your head is
gonna shoot straight ahead He
wouldnt cock out his elbows makes
no sense Besides you telling me
one guy came in here and killed eight
men with eight extremely well aimed
shots in just a few seconds No way
Had to be at least two

INT PLAZA HOTEL SUITE LIVING ROOM NIGHT LATER
Smecker is now a complete mess His hair is totally frazzled

He is sucking on cigarettes long and hard His clothes are
completely disheveled

SMECKER
Television television is the
explanation for this

Smecker points toward the ceiling revealing a huge gaping
hole in it just above the living room

SMECKER

You see this is bad television

(again pointing out

the hole in the

ceiling)
The little assault guys creeping in
through the vents and coming in
through the ceilings That James
Bond shit never happens in real life
Professionals dont do that So weve
got this up here which has novice
written all over it And all this
down here thats simply a perfect
textbook assassination So heres
our two possibilities We either
have rank amateurs that got lucky or
consummate professionals that fucked

up

The detectives nod in agreement They are now completely
taken in by Smeckers spell

SMECKER
Join me in a drink gentlemen

They go over and grab seats at the bar Smecker mixes himself
a gin and tonic on the other side He is calming down now

and going back into cool mode He starts to tuck his clothes
back in and fix his hair He leans over the bar and sips his
drink The three detectives lean in

With the exception of my coffee boy
you Boston detectives are starting
to show signs of intelligence So I
am going to make you privy to some
information that you would not
normally be These men are all Russian
mob Not like those two peons in the
alley the other day These guys are
all syndicate bosses and underbosses
I have a dossier on every man in
this room Since the Iron Curtain
has gone down the Russian syndicates
have started to come here And in
the spirit of Glasnost the Soviets
have opened their borders to the
mafia But the Italians theyre not
convinced that the grounds in mother
Russia are fertile enough for
organized crime yet So they aint
ready to commit The Russians are
coming here anyway They are
unwelcome What we have here
gentlemen is possibly the beginning
of the first international mob war
unless Ive totally missed something

All their faces read the gravity of the situation

SMECKER
Now what is this going to look like
to those who do not know what I just
told you

DUFFY
Its gonna look like the bad guys
are killing each other

SMECKER
And is there an American shit is
there a man seated among us that
hasnt thought about it many times
lets just put them all on an island
give them guns and let them kill
each other This is our wet dream
come true You can expect federal
and local law enforcement to go only
deep enough to satisfy the law then
bury it from here on out

So what do we do now

That depends You either do your job
or get ethical

He is upset He slams down a chair across from the brothers

The boys are walking across Copley Square Connor looks at

the note he wrote at the police station They stand on the
sidewalk and light smokes They are in their regular garb
thick naval P-coats jeans and leather boots They each carry
a mid-sized black duffle bag They are serious and business-

The elevator stops at the lobby level Nine well-dressed
men enter Their faces are not shown The boys move to the
back wall

One guy says something quickly to another in Russian The
other gives a one word Russian response They boys look at
each other As the elevator climbs their eyes focus

The door opens As the men exit the elevator each face is
seen individually all are victims from Smeckers crime scene

The elevator goes up half a floor They hit the stop button
and rummage in their bags They suit up black gloves and
black masks They strap on four 9mm pistols with silencers
in shoulder holsters one under each arm Connor takes a

looks at Murphy and at the rope in his bag Murphy is too
excited to argue

Connor grabs Murphys shirt

MURPHY

The boys get into a close quarters battle An occasional
insult is thrown as feet kick and fists fly They begin to
get tangled in their own rope The seam of the duct breaks
and a tangled mess of rope and MacManuses pour out

INT PLAZA HOTEL SUITE NIGHT

They crash through the ceiling right above the fat mans
head The rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt
hanging them upside down back to back about six feet above
the floor They are turning in circles The boss is balled
up in the fetal position on the floor The shocked Russians
say only a word or two in panic before the MacManus brothers
react reaching for their guns The Russians start to reach
for their guns Its too late The boys draw and fire as
they spin Taking four shots apiece

There are eight dead Russians Chests explode as they fall
back on the couch in a loose circle One victims is blasted
over the couch

They notice the fat man directly beneath them Murphy grabs
his Rambo knife reaches up and cuts the rope They land in

a heap scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his
knees They each put a gun to the back of his head and recite
this prayer in perfect unison

forth to thee and teeming with souls
shall it ever be E nomini patri et

With the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and
go to black and white (Slo-mo) Choral music starts with
Latin script being read in the background They take their
rosaries out They slowly walk around mumbling prayers as
they care for the dead They gently turn over the bodies
that were on their stomachs They brush the hair back from
the victims faces They place pennies in the eyes of al the
corpses When they finish their ritual they pull off their
masks and look at each other They start to grin and look
around They work each other into a healthy chuckle

CONNOR
(looks up)
That was some good fuckin rope

They both laugh

MURPHY
That was way easier than I thought

Murphy picks up a wad of bills

They stand at each side of the double doors looking through
the peepholes They see Rocco on the other side dressed as a

and a name tag that reads Jaffar He has a good cart in front

INT SIN BIN SMALL ROOM NIGHT
Smecker ascends the three small steps up to the round room

A NUDE DANCER sits there on the couch in a robe She is crying
as she is being consoled by Detective Duffy This small room
is where men watch girls through a large glass window

In this room a dancer performs on a floor a few feet above
the three private booths where each man watches from his own
booth She appears as if on stage All three windows are
shattered and there is blood on the wall of all three booths

We see assorted body parts in each booth but no faces

DOLLY
(approaches Smecker)
She was in here when it went down

SMECKER
Can she ID them

DOLLY
They were wearing masks

SMECKER
Of course they were How many

SMECKER
Nah too quick half their
infrastructure got taken out at the

the Russians or the Italians Theres
no riding the fence Our little theory
from last night just got blown to
shit Something new is going on
here

Smecker sits next to the girl He has Compassion She Cries

Probably shouldnt work another shift
for awhile

who I gotta blow to do it

INT SIN BIN SMALL ROOM NIGHT
The bodies have been removed and chalk outlines replace them

The bullet holes in the walls have been marked either A or
B The detectives watch Smecker He is a mess His clothes
are disheveled and his hair is frazzled

that their mark was the guy in the
middle booth After she watches them
whack him she passes out

Why the two extra victims

GREENLY
Witness

SMECKER
No way they could have seen it

Smecker hits an orange button on the wall and a black steel
door with a money slot comes slamming down in front of the
first booth He does the same thing to the last booth leaving
the middle one open Both doors possess peep holes

Allow me to enlighten you gentlemen
to the protocol of the porno industry
as Im sure youve never been in one

between you and its

gesture with hand)

No way they could have seen it

SMECKER
Those doors were down which means
this They looked down in through
the peep hole saw these guys and
opened the doors from the inside
Pop pop pop right through the
glass Why

DOLLY
Maybe the three of them had something
in common

SMECKER
No This guy is big time
(points to middle
booth)
These two are street-walking scum

GREENLY
(kidding)
Then thats what they had in common
They were all bad guys now theyre

all dead bad guys

Smecker seems side-tracked and ponderous at Greenlys
observation He hits the orange buttons and raises the doors

SMECKER

We got another thing to think about
here We got us a genuine Kennedy
assassination style bullet theory
Two guns were used here guns A and
B The guy in the middle was done
with both But this guy

(denotes right booth)
-he was killed with bullets from
gun A only And this guy

(denotes left booth)

-gun B only But ballistics dug
two slugs out of the wall from over
here where the victim was done with
A

Smecker points to two bullet holes in the wall of the booth
on the left Each is marked B He walks over to the right

booth where in the exact location are two identical holes

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
marked A

SMECKER
And its the same story over here
Why the crossover

Theories
DOLLY
Thats just fucking weird I have no
idea
DUFFY

Jesus I just cant think anymore
That scene over at the coffee shop
today tapped me out

SMECKER
What

DUFFY
A guy went nuts over off of
Commonwealth today Shot three guys
to death in a coffee shop in broad

daylight Fled the scene Dont have
much on him

SMECKER
(angry)
Why was I not informed of this

GREENLY
They werent related The guy used a
38 No pennies Totally amateur

SMECKER
Who were the victims

GREENLY
A couple of peons for the mob and

SMECKER

(livid)
Oh thats just BEAUTIFUL All the
scumbags in the quiet city of Boston
start dropping dead and you think
its unrelated Greenly the day I
want the Boston Police doing my
thinking for me I will have a fucking
tag on my toe Now get me a squad
car and get me over there I want
the crime scene photos and any witness
statements NOW

Smecker storms from the room The detectives begin to follow

Smecker comes barreling back in shoving them out of the
way He looks at the bullet holes in the walls marked A and

B again Something has clicked

SMECKER
(wide-eyed)
Oh it looks like we got us a

INT LAKEVIEW LUNCH NIGHT

Smecker surveys photos and papers as he smokes profusely

He stands next to a table in the back where chairs are knocked
over Body chalk and blood stains are everywhere The

detectives seem like they dont want to be there again

SMECKER
The shooter knew these guys huh

DOLLY
How do you figure

SMECKER
Friends Gentlemen They were friends

Smecker flashes them a photo of a dead body The victim is
shot in the head and face down in his plate of food His
hands are on the table in front of him

SMECKER
These guys were packing Not one
hand near a gun Its simple human
behavior Someone you dont know
approaches you you put your hand on
it This guys got his hands on the
table Hes eating his food for
Christ sakes They were friends

Smecker looks over the bar

SMECKER

These two fucking scenes are related
Too many coincidences Same day

Five hours apart Dead mobsters on
both scenes Now why did he kill
the bartender

DUFFY
Crime of passion He just went nuts
He would have shot everyone in here
He just ran out of bullets

SMECKER
Duffy This look like a fucking post
office to you This guy came in here
with intent Maybe he didnt know
exactly what he was gonna do but he
had a pretty good idea The bartender
wasnt a fucking accident

DUFFY
Well we didnt get any help on that
A lot of people saw it Nobodys
talking

SMECKER

Fucking figures Look are you guys
seeing the pattern here We got big
questions at both of these crime
scenes with no answers WHY did
they kill the guys in the other two
booths WHY did he do the bartender
It would seem unnecessary even
stupid

(angry)
God I hate cold crime scenes Im
fucking leaving now And do me a
favor tell me when the next guy
dies cause these guys are not done
yet

He storms to the entry way

INT LAKEVIEW LUNCH ENTRY WAY NIGHT

his hand down on it and knocks his assailant in the skull

coat He throws it on the walk the blood splatters He picks
up the remnants of the balloon and puts them back in his
pocket and stands there waiting looking at the house

Suddenly he throws open his trench coat to reveal a special
leather vest beneath Six guns all different are holstered
on the front of it three on each side extend from just below
his collar bones to his abdomen Connor and Murphy dont
hesitate They each draw one of their now unsilenced guns
from their shoulder holsters and aim one arm over each of
Roccos shoulders The Duke draws his top two weapons and
aims

SMECKER
And this was a fucking bomb dropping
in Beaver Cleaverville For a few
seconds this place was Armageddon
There was a fire fight

They all start shooting at once The noise is deafening

The Taurus is being pierced and the front of the house is
splintering as it is riddled with bullets Smecker is still
in the middle hands raised to the heavens turning circles

Roccos pinky finger gets shot off sending blood splattering
against the house He dives in the bushes reeling He pulls
a gun and starts firing

Murphy catches a bullet in the arm and dives for the bushes
as well Il Duce with lightening speed drops the guns and
pulls the next two down as he walks to his right about ten
feet He commences firing and the casings hit the sidewalk
all different calibers and sizes are dropping down the walk

Its him and Connor and nobody is backing down They both
grind their teeth as they fire rapidly at each other At the
same moment The Duke gets hit in the arm and Connor takes a
bullet in the leg The firing ceases for a moment

Connor remains steady and Il Duce looks down at his arm and
his own blood splattered on the sidewalk

IL DUCE
No No No

He drops the guns and pulls the last two as he moves to the
right He fires with wrath as he screams the word No over

and over Rocco and Murphy return fire from the bushes yelling
and swearing as Connor does the same from his position on

the stoop

The Duke turns and runs leaving a sea of casings and guns
that extend for 35 feet down the walk There are also two
blood stains

na frenzy the boys and Rocco get up and withdraw some spray
bottles from their bags The begin spraying all their own
blood stains on the stoop and the front of the white house

They then pick up their things and run off

his hands as he rages The police and forensics all back
off

SMECKER

He backs against the building and slides down to a sitting
position in the bushes as if he has given up He raises his
head and there he sees Roccos pinky finger lying undiscovered
in the bushes He pulls a small plastic bag from his pocket
and scoops it up He shoves it back into his pocket and races
off

PRIEST
How long since your last confession

SMECKER

Oh Christ uh Ive never confessed

The priest can hear Connor and Rocco whisper but Smecker
cannot

SMECKER
According to the dogma of the Catholic
church I should probably burst into
flames right here in this booth But
Ive come here for advice not
salvation

Connor and Rocco stop and listen now
PRIEST

Why have you come to a church for
council if youre not religious

SMECKER
(ponderous )

have before I guess I just felt

SMECKER
Its ethics I put evil men behind
bars but the law has miles of red
tape and loopholes for these
cocksuckers to slip through Ive
found out there are these two young
men who fix the situation with an
iron fist As if they have Gods
permission But what they do is wrong
and I should arrest them
technically

PRIEST
Gods permission God doesnt

Rocco shakes the priest

SMECKER
But in this day and age I believe
what they do is necessary I feel
it is correct
PRIEST
You believe
SMECKER
Yes
PRIEST
You feel
SMECKER
Yes
PRIEST

You feel A soul is what gives you
feelings Happiness guilt right or
wrong It is a conduit through which
the Lord speaks to us You felt that
your answers would be here in the
house of God today You feel these

men are necessary The Lord has spoken
to you twice this day

Lord of your own free will speaking
of beliefs and feelings Is it so

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomllibrary
much to believe that God has brought
you here

SMECKER
I guess not

It is easy to be sarcastic about
religion It is harder to take small
hints from God your feelings and
listen to them to take a stand

The look of surprise on Rocco and Connors faces show that
the priest is doing a hell of a job

SMECKER
Youre right

PRIEST
Those who do not act are in a constant
state of ethical indecision

SMECKER
want to stand for what I believe
in father

PRIEST
Then you must find out what your
beliefs are

SMECKER
believe these young men are right

PRIEST
You know them personally

SMECKER
Yes

PRIEST
Do you think they would harm an
innocent man for any reason

SMECKER
No They would never do that

The priest starts to show signs of anger as he starts turning
to Rocco

SMECKER
Well the two Irish guys wouldnt
But the Italian guy he might Hes
kind of an idiot

to the priests head and jostles him

Rocco jostles the priest again

PRIEST
The laws of God are higher than the
laws of man

SMECKER

Yes Yes I was thinking that too
No I was feeling it All I needed
was to hear you say it Amen Ill

Forgive me father

Thank you Father thank you

of the cross but
screws it up)
Whatever Goodbye amen
