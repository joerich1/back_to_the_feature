BIG WEDNESDAY

PART I
THE SOUTH SWELL

SUIMER 1963

The sea of the past was like a beautiful and unscrupu-
lous woman -- strong men with childlike hearts were
faithful to her were content to live by her grace --
to die by her will

Joseph Conrad
An Outcast of the Islands

When boards were made of wood and men were made of iron

-- Some old surfer

BIG WEDNESDAY

OCEAN - DAWN

The endless dark sea stretching west into infinite blackness
The ocean gently undulates rolls in its slumber and a wave

is faintly outlined in the first rays of dawn The wave rises
in its silence steepens and wind blows up its face spinning
a silvery mist behind As it towers and begins to topple for-
ward its sensuous form is broken by the dark appearance of a
man on a surfboard -- stroking up and through the concave
crest bursting free with an explosion of glittering light
and finally falling slowly out of sight behind

SHORELINE

The shadowy figure of a lean young man lopes seemingly in slow
motion towards a point A sleek surfboard is held under his
arm His face is tight and aggressive in expression his
breath measured His muscles ripple with each stride

BEACH

Wind blows paper across the darkened sand the lights of the
city sparkle in the distance park objects begin to move on
the beach as surfers wake up - crawl out of their sleeping

bags -- lean up on one arm and look out at the morning waves

NARRATOR (V0)
In the old days I remember a wind that
would blow down through the Canyons
before dawn It was a hot wind and
carried with it the smell of warm places
It blew strongest before dawn across The
Point My friends and I would sleep in
our cars --

HIGHWAY

A few cars lined up along the Pacific Coast Highway Lights
of trucks pass by with a roar Softer lights appear in the
cars as the surfers get out and stretch

NARRATOR (VO)
And the smell of the offshore wind
would often wake us and each day we
knew that this would be a special
day a special morning --

Some surfers pull shiny long boards from a panel truck and
enter the beach through a narrow gate in the torn cyclone
fence They make hooting sounds as they disappear into the
dawn

NARRATOR (V0)

(continuing)
And we often rode the long clean walls
before it was light before we could see
-- it was the ocean that really had us
back then More than anything in the
world - we needed a wave

THE WAVES

Black rising out of the darkness their crests turning white
and peeling over into spiralling cylinders -- suddenly we are
Yacing along the smooth black glass -- the wall looming up
before us curling falling seeing the lights of the city be-
yond the darkness that passes over us

The curling wave detonates in a shower of silver and gold as
the spray is lit by the rising sun

NARRATOR (V0)
We were young then -- and we didnt care
It was summer and the south swell the
summer swell the summer swell was strong
and the water was warm

FULL SHOT - CARS

JACK BARLOW and MITCH THE MASOCHIST supporting what appears

to be a dead Bopy stagger along the dirt path toward the -
gate They carry surfboards with their outside arms Jack is
a tall good-looking strong kid and Mitch is a powerfully
built kid with a savage crazy face The Body is dressed in
a ragged Hawaiian shirt and torn pants he is a silhouette
-- faceless

NARRATOR (V0)
I remember the three friends best
It was really their place their time
They were the ones who had started it
all -- They were the Big Names the
‘Kings -- our own royalty -- and it was
their last great summer

They walk further into the soft morning light

JACK
(singing)
‘And I believe the magic of your sighs
-- Will you still love me tomorrow’

MITCH -
She had thighs hand-shaped by God man
thighs by God -- I gotta do it

‘ JACK -
‘You say that Im the only one -
but will my heart be broken when the
night nieets the morning sun

MITCH
Hey Jack You ever been in love

JACK
Nope but Ive sure been stoked

They come to the gate in the cyclone fence ‘It is a narrow
opening and only one of them can fit through at a time Every
surfer must pass through this gate Below the beach drops
away to the sea and this small corner is called The Pit

Later in the day The Pit will be filled by The Big Names and
everyone who passes will undergo their scrutiny But now in
the dawn light only the sand blows in the morning wind ‘They
pause at the gate

JACK
(continuing)
Hold it Stop

They stop -- Jack lets go of his half of the Body It lands
limpon Mitch

JACK
(continuing to Body)
You wanta go through that gate youre
going have to do it on your own let
him go Mitch

Mitch lets go of the Body and he wavers on his own two feet
He staggers through the narrow gate and Mitch and Jack follow
behind carrying their boards

JACK
(continuing)
Wheres your board

BODY

JACK

BEACH WALL BARBED WIRE FENCE

Two GREMMIES stand by their boards that are Propped up against
an old barbed wire fence at the bottom of the pit Both of
them are dripping wet and they shiver in the early morning
cold One kid is tall and dorky looking and his mouth is hung
open in a kind of dumb stare His hair is bleached out white
on top from peroxide and he has on baggy trunks with beer la-
bels on them His surfboard is new and shining Next to him
is the other gremmie a younger kid with an innocent expres-
sion

TALL KID
(in a dorky voice)
The waves are so goood I got sooo
many good rides out there Did you
see that bitchen nose ride I got
It was sooo goood 1 hung ten over
just like Lance Johnson

LITTLE KID
Im stoked

Jack and Mitch walk up still supporting the Body

MITCH
(to Tall Kid)
Hey man like can we borrow your
board My friend really needs to
get in the water bad

The Tall Kid pretends he doesnt hear Theres a long uneasy
Silence Finally the Kid looks up arrogantly His little
friend tries to mimic him

TALL KID
Well look uh I dont know who
you are I dont lend my stick to
people you know Im a team rider
for Gordon and Smith

MITCH
Youre probably a Big Name or something
Like Im sorry that I didnt recognize
you man but my friend still needs a
board

The Kid gives the Body an appraising look
TALL KID
Well man ask somebody else I cant
lend my stick to some ho-dad
MITCH
Hes no ho-dad fella youre talking
about Lance Johnson

The Kid smiles laconically and looks down chewing on an
imaginary piece of gum He flips his peroxide hair out of
his eyes

TALL KID
Hey man dont try to put me on
I mean who do you think I am some
valley kook man

Mitch lets go of his half of the Body puts down his board
and stands in front of the Tall Kid pointing into his bony
chest

MITCH
Look you little pencil-neck geek --
we own this beach What do you think
youre doing here anyway

The Tall Kid backs away The Little Kid grabs his board off
the fence and hands it to Mitch Its an old waterlogged
board with a broken-off nose and rotted yellow foam

LITTLE KID
You can use my board I dont care
‘cause its wrecked

MITCH
(genuine)
Thank you -- Thank you very much

SHOREBREAK

Mitch and Jack push the Body out to sea on the Kids board
He drifts out past the shorebreak and his limp arms paddle
occasionally Mitch and Jack paddle out after him and escort
him out to the point

OCEAN
BODY
Howebiquéssit
JACK
Its about six with sets of seven
BODY

JACK

Well man you do whatever you have to

Mitch and Jack turn and start for a peak building outside
the point In a moment they are gone The Body rubs his
aching head

BODY
(continuing)

SHTE
POINT

‘

The kids walk up the beach towards the point

TALL KID
You shoulda never let that kook
leech your board

LITTLE KID
I had to or the other guy wouldve
pounded you Besides its their

beach
TALL KID
Yeah well how were we ‘sposed to
know
LITTLE KID
(pointing)

Look hes in the lineup
OCEAN

The Body doesnt paddle really He just sort of raises his
arms out of the water and lets them fall in again But some-
how he has drifted into the center of the peak near some other
surfers and a good set is coming The first wave passes under
him and he is almost run down by TWO SURFERS taking off

FIRST SURPER
Coming down

The second wave is bigger and starts to rise ominously behind
him He flops his arms

CLOSE SHOT - KIDS

TALL KID
Wow Hes gonna get sucked over Geez
hell probably drown Look hes even got
the board pointed left Oh wow -

OCEAN

The waves suck the back of the board up His arms flop again
Suddenly the board slips forward and starts to careen down
the wave left right towards the gaping jaws of the Tube The
body pulls himself teetering to his knees and then one foot
and finally the other He is all bent over at the bottom of
the wave with eight feet of water about to fold on him
Suddenly it happens ‘he legs in a crouch straighten The
hands flash around the head held erect the whole body tensed
with power The board goes past the Tube down into the flat
in front of the wave and leans over on its side so that the
fin is almost showing The legs flex and the board and rider
rocket through the blasting hook and up into the face

The arms turn again and the board blazes up across the concave
lip holding on only with its inside edge and cutting a solid
arc that breaks the wave in half Then down down with incre-
dible speed and into another searing forty-foot bottom turn
with the back arched and one hand out casually seeming to hold
up the onrushing section The wave steepens suddenly and the
toes are extended over the tip of the board The section
comes over and the feet deftly back-pedal to the middle of the
board giving such tremendous momentum that board and rider
literally blow the white water apart and emerge onto the clean
face again At this point the rider holds his stomach and
belches loudly

Then he shuffles the board out under his feet smoothly and
starts to turn swiftly up and down the wave in a smooth but
violent roller-coaster motion Weaving with the curl gaining
speed with each arching turn Another surfer is encountered
here and the rider slips his board over the top of the wave
He stands there for a moment casually gliding in the flat
water -- And then falls off head first into the ocean

CLOSE SHOT KIDS
The Tall Kids mouth hangs open more than usual

TALL KID
That is Lance Johnson

LITTLE KID
Yeah and hes riding my board

TITLES OVER MONTAGE of black-and-white photos showing
characters waves boards and spirit of the surfing life --
Circa 1963 -- The last great summer

CLOSE SHOT - KIDS
A SHOT we will see again -- an expression we-will come to know
- two kids young gremlins about fourteen or fifteen their

eyes glued on something far away something they want but
cant yet have --

special feeling for more than just the wave or the surfer
they are watching A sense of awe and promise A sense of
pure unabashed enthusiasm and respect Stoked Stoked out of
their minds

FULL SHOT - PIER

The kids stand on the end of the long and rickety pier down
from the point It is black with age and most of the small
shacks that were once on it have been removed Soon it will
be condemned

FULL SHOT - BEARS SHACK

At the end of the pier across from the rusted boat-launching
hoist is Bears Shep a ramshackle edifice of rotting wood
and tin Everything is darkened or rusted from the weather
except some newly painted signs -- BEAR CAGE - SURFBOARDS
AND BAIT ASK FOR BEAR THIS IS NOT A DRESSING ROOM SRE
IF YOU CAN GET THIS BEAR DRUNK BEER BY THE BOTTLE INSIDE

e

DIFFERENT ANGLE - BEAR

Silhouetted against the Morning sun is BEAR He is about 32
stocky dark and bearded iis clothes are covered with fish
scales and resin stains He has a darkly commanding presence
about him as he watches the distant point with field glasses
The two young surfers (gremmies) DENNY and FLEA stand near
him They like the generation of surfers who came before
them see everything in the Bear

Bear seems to smile
BEAR
Go on Lance -- stay high in the
section -- thats right bottom turn
out blast through Keep your speed
Stay in trim Now give me a cut-back
Denny and Flea watch intently

DENNY
Hes got such a boss cut-back

B
Do it mar

He sighs with satisfaction and hands the glasses to Flea

PLEA
Jesus Hes gonna get back on the nose

Bear walks back towards a wooden surfboard on a sawhorse

BEAR
The whole ride was the cut-back -
-- the rest was just to get there

DENNY
How do you mean

BEAR
When you can cut-back like Lance
youll know what I mean

He looks down the sleek shape of a raw balsa wood board
feels the sun with his open hand

He pulls a long piece of fiberglass over the board and starts
to cut it

DENNY
Was Lance always hot I mean when
he was my age

‘BEAR
You think hes really great dont you

DENNY
Yeah -- I -- Id like to surf like
that when I get hot

BEAR
Hes good so is Jack and Mitch in
his own way They need more --
experience -- something extra to be
great -- Being a great surfer is
More than a good cut-back Lance will
be great some day They could all do
it if they keep on surfing

DENNY
Whataya mean Those guys are so stoked
Theyll surf forever

Bear looks up from his work The board is draped ina neat
fiberglass shroud

BEAR
Nobody surfs forever

Denny and Flea look stunned They watch as Bear walks over
to a pile of buckets and starts opening some resin

DENNY
You still do it dont you Bear

BEAR
Only when its necessary

He stirsup the resin

BEAR
(continuing)
Look I know what it means to be
stoked I know what its like to
have the bug but I know what can
happen I know how things can change

CLOSE SHOT - RESIN

He pours it on his board in a large thick pool The gremnies
look down at it as Bear spreads it out over the board with
his brush -- he uses measured even strokes lapping up the
viscous liquid here and moving it there Only his hands show

BEAR
Hell one time I lived in my car a
whole year and ate only cottage cheese
because it was more efficient I did
nothing but travel up and down the
coast looking for waves I didnt
think about anything else

DENNY
Not even chicks

Bear laughs to himself

BEAR
Id fall in love now and then but
they could never take me for very long
Just like now -- I can get ‘em here --
I just cant keep ‘em here

The gremmies listen ‘Theyve heard the stories before from
others perhaps but this time will be burned into their
minds forever

PLEA
When was that Bear

BEAR
After World War II There was only
about four or five of us around here
then -- guys like Joe Quigg Woodie
Barnes Bob Simmons They were real
gentlemen They were solid guys We
had The Point all to ourselves

PLEA
What happened

BEAR -
Korea stopped us short I learned
a lot in Korea -- I walked out of
Chosin Reservoir -- I wanted the
Commies to shoot me so I wouldnt
have to he cold anymore - I only
thought about one thing then -- that
if I lived Id come back here -- and
never want for anything more

He starts tucking the fiberglass around the rails with his
brush

- BEAR
(continuing)
I came back here with the others
-- those that were left It was
devotion like seeing a girl again
We swore we would never leave but
Im the only one thats still here

DENNY
What happened to those guys

BEAR
Got married Settled down Went
on to something else I never
see them anymore

A WOMAN and two small KIDS wander up with fishing poles

WOMAN
You have fresh bait

BEAR
Sure thing -- same as yesterday
Denny Wrap up some chopped mussel

Denny digs into a bucket and comes up with the chopped mussel
It smells foul Bear trims the wet fiber down around the
board Denny wraps the bait quickly in some newspaper and
hands it to the woman taking her money It is obvious he
has done this many times before and others have done it before
him There are prerogatives and glassing surfboards and
telling stories should never be interfered with

FLEA
‘What kind of a hoard is that Ive
never seen a shape like that

BEAR
My board -- its a big wave board --
gun -- I rode it in the islands --
One time I rode it alone in Point surf
at Makaha at 20 feet --

19 You rode twenty feet alone

DENNY

FLEA
Thats so hairy

BEAR
Youre always alone anyway if you
think about it -- “hats the test
of a surfer to ride alone You
shouldnt have to depend on anybody
but yourself Thats when you can
appreciate your friends

He finishes his board and stands up to admire his handiwork
The board is long and sleek and the balsa well matched in
grain and weight There is much more work to be done but
already there is something about this board

He starts

FLEA
You ever gonna ride this board
again Bear

DENNY
Youd have to go back to the islands
to get anything big enough for it to
work Wouldnt you

BEAR
No
Clearing up around the area
BEAR
(continuing)

Youll here talk every now and then

of a big day -- its true -- a big

day - no explanation -- no known storm
fronts - just a big day aA day when
the ocean surprises you -- makes you
remember whats out there Makes you
draw the line

He walks to the edge of the pier -- the gremmies look wide-

eyed

BEAR
(continuing)
Itll happen here -- if you wait
long enough - It happened in 53 --

ten years ago -- the swells were far
apart -- 20 to the set -- it kept
building -- building just coming across

the horizon in tremendous black lines
- Few rode -- a guy was killed --

He looks into the water

BEAR

(continuing)
Never more than a few ride -- Its
going to happen again -- Itll be a
swell so big and so strong that itll
wipe clean everything that went before
it -- and everything that follows will
never be the same Thats when this
boardll be ridden

DENNY
Did you ride in 53

BEAR
Yeah but I didnt distinguish
myself -- my day came in 56 -- in
the islands -- The same thing -- a
big day --Bigger than anyone could
ever imagine -- a day when you draw
the line Thats the last time I rode
this board -- Itll come again -- and
thats when Lance Jack and Mitch could
distinguish themselves thats when
they could draw the line

OCEAN

Jack and Lance high up on their knees paddle their boards
out through the glinting inside cove They have stoked
expressions The bubbling surf the sun on their backs the
power pulsating through their youthful bodies They are
carefree feeling the exhilaration of the moment

Lance is towing another surfboard with his foot and it trails
behind him He paddles up to a KID swimming in through the
waves and shoves him the board

KID
(to Lance)
Hey wow youre Lance Johnson
arent you

The Kid scrambles onto his board Lance and Jack continue
paddling out

They paddle up to Mitch who is sitting on his board waiting
for a wave He grins There is a cut on his forehead
Blood trickles down his face

JACK
Mitch youre bleeding

14

MITCH
I dont give a shit

A wave looms up and Mitch swings his board around and starts
to take off The wave steepens and begins to topple over
Mitch snaps his board around and takes two jerky hops toward
the nose

LANCE
Wheeehoos--Ge Masochist

Mitch jerks his hips mambo fashion weaving his way through
the bowl He rises high in the wave defying the sucking
tube Suddenly his board drops out beneath him Mitch
flails his arms trying to gain balance His board catches an
edge pearls into the wave then comes knifing up between
Mitchs legs CRACK THUD He is twirled over in the ex-
plosion of foam Lance and Jack watch intently

JACK
Oh Jesus

LANCE
Right-between- the legs

About ten yards down the line Mitch comes to the surface with
a pained but triumphant expression

MITCH
(yelling)
Rail sandwich

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jack and Lance come paddling up to a bunch of surfers
straddling their boards in the kelp beds Theres a big
tough-looking guy in cut-off Levis -- ENFORCER And a thick
guy with a mean face -- CRUSHER And theres FLY OSTRICH and
PANHEAD dorky-looking surfers that resemble their names And
theres a blonde cockylooking surfer -- MICKEY THE CAT All
of them have strong builds dark tan and faded trunks

A good five-foot wave peaks up just off the point Jack
whips his board around and paddles over into position

LANCE
(to Jack)
Ti teagotyournamecoretter

Jack makes a late take-off as a thin veil of water peels
across his chest He arches his back then takes two quick
agile steps to the nose holding his hands close to his side
-- typical of his intense classical style Jack zooms by on
the wave Everybody looks back over their shoulders and
watches

He squeaks through section after section making it through at
the last possible second Jack is Clearly ripping the wave
apart

ENFORCER
(yelling)
Go Scoota

FLY
(yelling)

Jack bursts through the back of the wave and glides into the
flat water on his board He gets down and starts to paddle
back out satisfied grin on his face

LANCE
(smiles)

PLY
» Hey what are we going to do
about all these valley cowboys

ENFORCER -
Run them over Survival of the
fittest --

He turns and strokes powerfully for a wave gritting his
teeth maniacally Formidable -

ENFORCER
(continuing)
Natural selection -- Coming down
assholes

He catches the wave disappears momentarily from sight as he
drops in and comes searing up in a good turn

ENFORCER
(continuing)
My wave punks

No one dares take off -- he turns casually up and down looking
mean and takes two steps to trim his board through an oncoming
section

ENFORCER
(continuing)
Hey -- Coming down

The surfer at the end of the section obviously doesnt hear or
doesnt need to Its a young girl about 16 a beginner --
out of control with a sweet innocent expression on her face
She has negotiated the take-off -- somehow turned and is
getting the ride of her life - stoked Enforcer comes
steaming up from behind shrugs his shoulders -- embarrassed
-- and takes the wet axe in the next section -- the girl
slides through

CLOSE - ENFORCER

He stands in the rocks watching his board wash in and then
looks off wistfully towards the girl

FULL SHOT - THE GROUP

They laugh

CRUSHER
Rock dance

PANHEAD
Get her number Enforcer shes

FLY

Yeah man - utilize it
Mickey shrugs -- turns to Lance

MICKEY
Its an invasion -- I mean these
valley barbarians are even using
women in the front ranks -- They
depend on our chivalry --- they know
were the last of our kind and cant
help ourselves --
(he puts his hands up)
- Your wave Lance baby

A hollow four-footer looms up and Lance is in position He
glides easily into the wave with one stroke He fades his
board left and swings it around right with the grace and
power that has made him famous Everyone watches as the wave
lines up and Lance takes four casual steps and stands with his
hands to his side and his toes curled over the tip of his
board

LANCES POV

An unforgettable moment -- a peak an essence A wave
stretches out in front and builds into a rising emerald wall
surfers paddle up and over as if in slow motion their
boards forming a myriad of colors against the greens of the
sea the kelp and rocks passing below and the crisp white of
the curl It is a summer tapestry framed in golden light --
the wave -- the surfer -- the rocks - the coast -- the sky
- all held for eternity and rushing by in an instant
Friends pass by waving

BREATHMAN
Go Lance - hot

OSTRICH
Hoot -- Hooot All-time hoooter --

Kids look up and smile

CLOSE SHOT LANCE

He smiles with an innocent joy -- the height of freedom --
the pride of being good at what you do -- the last vestige
of a carefree adolescence -- a golden moment

LANCES POV

Enforcer paddles below with the young girl -- they smile up
as we PASS

ENFORCER
Do it Lance -- Crack it -

He smiles at the girl and is gone - then suddenly Mitch is
SEEN in the oncoming wall -- he spins around takes off --
his board smoking white spray in front of us -- laughing back
over his shoulder

DIFFERENT ANGLE

Jack strokes into the wave turns smoothly and all three ride
abreast laughing and pushing one another —

LANCE
“MY METER Wave

MITCH
Go back to the valley

JACK
Get on Mitchs board - come on

Lance steps to Mitchs board -- Jack steps back on it -- their
own boards bounce away after battering at their knees and
then for a brief second all three friends are on the same
board yelling and clowning as they ride into the steep shore-
break and the wave collapses on them sending them sprawling
end over end

DIFFERENT ANGLE

Mitch ends up on the sand in a contorted position -- Lance and
Jack wash up on the rocks -- they all howl with laughter

DISSOLVE TO
THE PIT

The Pit is the dirty rugged part of the beach that commands a
view of the entire point -- the chosen place of the Big Names
There are clumps of seaweed here and there swarming with kel
flies An old barbed-wire fence runs along the steep incline
of sand and an array of different colored long boards are
propped up against it Behind the fence is a sea of rusty
tin cans and broken bottles and then a tall crumbling white
brick wall covered with graffiti PORKCHOPS IS A KOOK -
LONG LIVE KING LANCE -- TODAY THE POINT TOMORROW THE WORLD

Scattered around the Pit are more of The Point regulars

Some lounge on old beat-up couches and others lie stomach-
first in the sand Theres CHUBBY and BOOGIE the Hawaiians
strumming their guitars Theres STORK and Breathman They
drink wine and glare at the kooks walking down through the
Pit carrying their boards

Jack walks up out of the water and sets his board carefully

against the fence WAXER (short for The Midnight Waxer) a

wild-looking youth with flowing red hair walks over wearing
his ragged ankle-length Luftwaffe officers coat

WAXER °
Hey Jack -- gonna be a hooter -- I just

MITCH

Katé smiles and shakes her head

KATE

Lance comes up carrying his hoard ate jumps to her feet
and kisses him on the cheek

KATE
(continuing)
Oooh You were great Youre hot

Lance casually sets his board against the old barbed-wire
fence and belches loudly

LANCE
Thanks

Denny trots up carrying a new shining yellow surfboard He
plops the board in the sand in front of Lance Kate and Mitch
and stands back to admire it

DENNY

Jack walks up looks over at Mitch and grins He takes some
wax from his wax pocket

JACK

to Mitch)

DENNY

Come on give it to me

Mitch throws the board back down on the sand and begins to
wax it up

MITCH

DENNY

EXT STARBURGER CAFE

Starburger Cafe is a down-home hash house across the street
from the pier A large neon star now in disrepair marks
the spot Tanned young girls with bleached blonde hair sit
beneath the star and watch their boyfriends twirl around the
sidewalk on skateboards

INT STARBURGER

Inside the cafe there are a few tables and a counter for
eating Along the counter are selectors for the jukebox --
five cents a song Framed photos of old-time movie stars
line the walls

Lucy a loud rough kind-hearted old bat stands behind the
counter with SALLY the new waitress Sally is a beautiful
girl Blonde hair blue eyes long and lean She has a sort
of wholesomeness Sally is wiping the tops of some ketchup
bottles and Lucy is busying herself behind the grill

Sally looks out through the windows and sees Jack Lance and
Mitch walking towards the cafe She focuses on Jack

LUCY
And as far as the scrambled eggs
go there aint nothing to it
Just heat up the pan throw in the
eggs and beat the shit out of them

The boys walk into the cafe Sally catches herself turns to

keeps eating Sally looks surprised

About three weeks

Lance scoops up a few strands of spaghetti and flings it over
at Mitch ‘The noodles cling to his forehead Sally cant
believe it

JACK
Row do you like it

Mitch nonchalantly takes another forkload of spaghetti and
flicks it back at Lance The noodles stick in his hair
Sally is wide-eyed

SALLY
(looking at Lance and Mitch)
I like it a lot

Simultaneously Lance and Mitch dig into their bowls and
start heaving clumps of spaghetti at each other Lucy slams
down her spatula stomps over and plants herself in front of
Lance and Mitch their faces caked with spaghetti

EXT BARLOW HOUSE NIGHT

Pacific Palisades is a respectable upper-middle-class
neighborhood inhabited by young executives and wives
dedicated to PTA and Cub Scouts

It is a neighborhood of ranch-style homes with manicured
lawns and trimmed hedges

The Barlow house is distinguished from its counterparts by
its unkept yard a driveway jammed with derelict cars and the
droves of Jacks friends wandering in and out of the house

Tonight the Barlow house is bursting at its seams Lights
blaze from every room The outrageous SOUNDS of a PARTY
shake the house and flood the streets - BLARING MUSIC
LAUGHTER SHOUTING HOOTING and GIRLISH SHRIEKS Red lights
glow from the garage Girls climb in and out of a side win-
dow Neighbors on either side of the Barlow house nervously
pace the sidewalks

ENGINES REV TIRES SCREECH headlights appear out of the dark-
ness ‘57 Chevy Bel Aires Nomads panel trucks ‘57 Ford
station wagons and 50 Olds Fastbacks with surfboards hanging
out of the trunk They scoot into parking spots filling both
sides of the street

Denny and Flea sit on the fence in the front yard smoking
cigarettes trying to look tough Bear Chubby and Boogie
stagger towards the front door arm-in-arm carrying their
guitars

Combed and clean Ostrich Stork Panhead Breathman and Fly
walk into the party with their dates Mitch and Masochist
zooms into the driveway and parks his Porsche speedster be-
hind Jacks woodie A surfboard occupies the passencer seat
Mitch heads into the party wearing only a pair of dripping
wet trunks

Lance hisses down the street in his 40 Ford jumps the curb
and parks on the front lawn Girls squeal and giggle and
spill out of his car ‘vith them is Crazy Kate Lance pulls a
keg of beer from his trunk The girls start toward the house
Lance struggles with the keg and then powers into the party
alone

INT BARLOW HOUSE - JACKS PARTY ROOM

The narty room is a converted garage that looks like a cross
between a Tahitian bar and a whorehouse - red lights over-
head painted egg cartons on the ceiling a hatch cover bar
and classic surfing photos framed in bamboo

A pyramid of beer cans stands in the corner Album covers
are plastered to the walls -- Chuck Berry Little Richard
Fats Domino The Shirelles Four Seasons Coasters and
Elvis Presley

MUSIC STILL BLARES OVER the HI-FI Jack and Sally absorbed
in each other dance in the midst of a room packed solid
with sweat-covered steaming bodies Sally looks bewildered
and fascinated She has never been to a party like this be-
fore They are all there The Big Names from the South Bay
DEWY SMITH PHIL MILLER RUSTY ERICKSON MALCOMB McCASSEY
MIKE DOYLE BOBBY McTAVISH and of course the Crew from The
Point -- Enforcer Crusher Waxer Mickey Miles RUDE RUDY
Ostrich Fly Stork Panhead Breathman and Mitch the
Masochist

Everyone sways in unison to the ROCK AND ROLL The qirls
wear sexy sweaters and tight skirts They do the Jerk the
Stomp the Mashed Potatoes and the Watusi Waxer fiendishly
shuffles through a large stack of 45s sitting next to the
record player

ANOTHER ANGLE

Crazy Kate walks into the room followed by six tanned girls
Kate stands out from the rest with her broad smile noble
breasts and her tightly-fitted multi-colored 1920s hooker

INT MRS BARLOWS BEDROOM

Its a small tastefully-furnished bedroom MBS BARLOW a
small middle-aged woman with a cheerful face sits in an
easy chair reading a book The undulating SOUNDS of the
PARTY filter into her room - Mrs Barlow has been through
this a hundred times or more and she has learned to resign
herself and let come what may Her door swings open and a
couple of GIRLS rush in

FIRST GIRL
Whoops ‘Scuse us Mrs Barlow We
thought this was the bathroom

Mrs Barlow shrugs and returns to her book The Girls leave
giggling Jack walks in

JACK
Look Were just having a little
get-together I only invited a few
friends

Just outside the bedroom window comes the SOUND of someone
violently THROWING UP Mrs Barlow squirms with each retch

MRS BARLOW
The musics too loud

JACK my
Well turn it down

MRS BARLOW -
And keep Crusher off my coffee table

Outside the bedroom window comes more SOUNDS -- the RUSTLING

Bear softens

BEAR
What story -- I dont know

JACK
Tell it Bear I want Sally to hear

Rear sits back against the fence

BEAR
Boogie give me another beer It
May not be the same -- it changes
each time I tell it

Boogie hands Bear a beer and everyone becomes quiet Bear
looks over at Jack and Sally as if wanting to communicate
the story to them

BEAR

(continuing)
Well back in the Islands there was
a small groun of us that first used
to ride big waves on the north shore
We were a crazy bunch of bastards
- fools ‘We rode places no one had
ever ridden before -- Sometimes things
got really hairy -- We were a strange
breed -- When we rode Waimea the first
time Simmons was quoting Shakespeare
in the lineup

(he seems to be far

away trying to

remember the quote)
Anyway -- the day you wanta hear
about was in ‘58

He takes a long pull on the beer and looks out over everyone
and begins

BEAR
(continuing)

It was Woody Brown and another guy
-- they were best friends -- a friend
meant a lot to you then -- esnecially
when it was only the two of you in
big water ‘

(MORE)

BEAR (CONTD)
Woody and his friend were riding
Sunset Beach -- nobody knew much
about Sunset then -- It was getting
late and the waves were running
about 10 to 12 The sun was almost
down when it started to happen

More surfers move in quietly sit down on their haunches and
begin to listen to the story

Bi
(continuing)
A huge set -- coming from the horizon
-- the lines long and black -- must
have been 18 to 20 feet -- they
paddled for their lives

Denny and Flea look at each other wide-eyed

PEAR
(continuing)
Up -- up the first waves -- they
Cleared easily but the next waves
were bigger -- they paddled over
these and from the tops of them
they could see no end to the set
-- just towering black walls
shutting out the horizon

Bears expression is deep -- fanatical -- a mixture of awe
and remembered fears -- but his voice is measured -- forced
to control

BEAR

(continuing)
They paddled over sets of 25 raging
-- or 30 -- Waves bigger than anyone
had ever been in -- out nast the
lineup -- the whole coast was closed
out -- the water churned with black
rivers from the riptides -- They had
no choice but to paddle down to
Waimea where there might be a chance
to get in Waves were hitting the
cliff and splashing a hundred feet
high

(he motions with his

hands)
They were tired when that set came
-- I dont know how big it was --
they paddled up over wave after
wave -- 35 to 40 feet high

(MORE)

BEAR (CONTD)

Death waves Woody couldnt take it
anymore - his arms had turned to
rope -- He turned to his friend and
said ‘Fuck it lets drown’

(he hesitates his

voice grows quieter)
His friend was tired too -- he
didnt care if he died either and
so he didnt stop Woody when he
spun around and took off -- The
friend paddled out to sea in the
middle of the night -- It was pitch
black and he was paddling over 60-
foot waves and could hear them break
behind The Coast Guard found him
the next morning -- two miles off
shore -- out of his mind

He stops drinks

SALLY
What about the other one -- the one
that rode

BEAR

Ee should have made him go on --
They never found Woody -- never
found his body -- just pieces of
his board

CHUBBY
Big Wednesday 1958

BEAR
Yeah -- well -- it always happens on
a Wednesday

Sally looks at him and then at Jack

on the edge of his bed -- the soft curves of her breasts in
his T-shirt The fine lines of her long thighs filling his
jeans He is overwhelmed

It is a neighborhood of clapboard houses some rundown others

EXT THE BLUE FOX

Jack and Sally Lance and Kate stand by the entrance to the
Blue Fox -- a gaudy nightclub with photos of nude women
posted out front They are all looking at a baby parrot in
a birdcage that Sally is holding in her hands

An eager-looking CLUB OWNER carrying a flashlight walks
up to the group and waves his flashlight begging for them
to go inside the Blue Fox

CLUB OWNER

arches her back She presses forward a little more and the

Lance hops to his feet grabs the tall Surfer by the front of
his shirt and shoves him backwards into a table full of drunk
Marines The Marines drinks fly off the table and crash to
the floor The Surfer crunches the table into a pile of
splinters The Marines jump up trying to brush the spilt
drinks off their laps They pick the Surfer up by the seat
of his pants and launch him into the groups table More
drinks crash and the bird cage with the baby parrot tumbles
off to the floor

The parrot starts SQUAWKING Sally and Kate are knocked off
their seats A burly Marine muscles over to the overturned
table and starts smashing Lance in the face

Jack reaches across the table and grabs the Marine by the
hair Another Marine races over and cracks Jack on the head
with a beer bottle Jack is knocked to the floor his head
gushes with blood

The Mexican hartender runs over to the Marines‘ table with a
billy club A drunk Marine grinds a broken beer bottle into

EXT ALLEY

Lance staggers bloody and alone down a dark sinister alley
He stumbles over something and he jumps back startled He
kneels down and sees that it is a sailor cut to pieces with
knives Lance looks shocked He shakes the body and sees
that the cold clammy white figure is dead

The SOUND of FOOTSTEPS comes from out of the darkness Lance

EXT STREET

Down the empty dark side street Jack Sally and Kate lean
with their backs against the Makeshift Jack is bloody The
Makeshift is almost destroyed The headlights are smashed
The windows are broken The surfboards are gone The car
has been gutted -

Sally quietly sobs Jack puts his arm around her and tries
to comfort her Lance deliriously staggers up to the car
Kate reaches out and hugs him

MAIN STREET - DAWN

The morning light slowly begins to fill the dark deserted
main street It is the gray time after the light has come
and before the sun has risen The main street is empty and
silent of business No taxis no tourists no hustlers
Wangy dogs quietly nose into garbage cans searching for new
leftovers from the night before The air is cool and fresh
It is the time between day and night when time stops and
examines itself

Mitch and a pretty young Mexican GIRL walk out of an all-
night bar and wave goodbye to the bouncer They turn and
stroll easily along the street They look tired and very

happy

The Mexican Girl is strong and buxom and very pretty Her
dark hair is in slight disarray She wears an embroidered
white flowered dress wrinkled now and clinging to her tight
curves

Mitch has a happy grubby afterglow His old T-shirt and
Levis are more grubby than usual He wears the Girls funny
straw hat with flowers on the crown

Mitch and the Girl walk along holding hands swinging their
hands rhythmically Mitch with his outside hand carries a
brown paper bag filled with a cold can of beer Mitch and
the Girl smile like weary children after a party They stroll
down past the empty curio shops and deserted nightclubs They
swing their hands and seuffle their huarache sandals They
come to the end of the main street and turn down the side
street where the Makeshift is parked

Mitch stops and punches holes through the cold can of beer
Re takes a refreshing swallow and looks into the Girls face
They smile at each other exchanging a tired peaceful and
wonderful secret

Mitch looks down the empty side street and sees his friends
leaning up against the Makeshift In a lovesick mood Mitch
is oblivious to the destruction

MITCH
(yelling)
Hey everybody I want you to meet
Mrs Masochist

His VOICE ECHOES in the morning light There’s no answer
Mitch and the Girl come closer He sees the broken car and
his despondent friends Mitchs happy expression changes

JACK
Dont be an asshole Cant you see
weve been fucked over

Jack opens the door to the Makeshift and gets in behind the
wheel Sally Lance and Kate get in behind him Jack starts
up the car and backs out Mitch turns to the Girl

MITCH
I have to go My friends are in
trouble

Mitch looks at the Girl tenderly and then hugs her She sobs
on his shoulder

Mitch turns and hops in the car with the others The Girl
stands on the curb waving and wiping her tears The Makeshift
limps away down the bumpy broken dirt street

SHORELINE

Jack and Sally are walking up the shoreline towards the
point

-

The evening shadows are starting to creep along the beach A
cold north wind is whipping down the coast and blowing side-
shore to the waves Seagulls are frozen in mid-air suspended
by the wind Sally and Jack walk along barefooted Little
waves lick their way up the curved beach and circle around
their ankles

SALLY
(shivering)
I thought this was supposed to be
summer Im freezing

Jack puts his arm around Sally as they walk along

JACK
Summer is over Theres always a
day when you know its dead Then
you have to face the winter

SALLY
I thought winters were warm here

JACK
They are but the water gets cold

He looks out at the waves breaking off the point

JACK
(continuing)
Hey thats Bear out there

The dark figure of Bear on a surfboard glides smoothly across
a glassy evening wave The wave breaks softly and reflects
the crimson sky Bear maneuvers easily through each section
There is mastery in his style

Bear glides out of a small wave gets down on his board and
starts paddling towards the old pier The lights from the
pier shimmer on the darkening water Bears dark figure
blends with the shadows and in a moment he is gone

SHORELINE

Jack shrugs puts his arm around Sally and they start walk-
ing up the shoreline again They walk past the little curv-
ing point across the beach toward a clump of little sand
dunes

The sun begins to disappear in the west The purple mountains
in the fg cast long cold shadows across the beach The
ocean glistens orange with the last rays of light Sally and
Jack come to a flat spot in the dunes Jack spreads out the
blanket and they sit down looking out at the sunset

SALLY
I feel like Ive grown up and gotten
old in twentyfour hours

JACK
Weve been through a lot

SALLY
Too bad about Mexico Im sorry you
didnt get what you wanted

JACK
I got what I wanted

SALLY
Hows that

Jack looks into her eyes

JACK
I got you

Sally looks away gathers her courage and then looks back at
Jack

SALLY
Is this what its like

Jack looks deeply

JACK
Why not

He leans over and kisses Sally and they roll back on the
blanket

Jack kisses her tenderly and rubs her long even thighs Sally
groans and spreads her legs Jack kisses her on the neck and
she starts breathing harder He unbuttons her blouse and be-
gins to fondle her fine soft breasts He reaches down and
unzips her Levis and feels her gently Sally wiggles to get
her Levis free and then kicks them off into the sand Jack
pulls his shirt off over his head and slips off his pants
Sally takes off her bra and blouse and they hold each other
tightly

The sand dunes are lonely and desolate The wind is cold and
unrelenting Sally and Jack grab on to each other like it is
all they have

VOICES can be HEARD drifting on the wind They are desperate
lonely faraway voices reaching out for one last carefree
moment The world seems to be slipping away with the evening
light All that was home is now plunging aimlessly into the
unknown An era is dead Darkness and cold are coming in

WAXERS VOICE
Lance is king of The Point

MITCHS VOICE
Porkchops is a kook

LANCES VOICE

The LAUGHTER ROARS for a moment then begins to DIE DOWN

The VOICES of Lance Mitch Crazy Kate Waxer Chubby Boogie
Crusher Enforcer and Panhead They become a distant
CHUCKLE then a MURMUR and then they are gone --

Forever

Jack rolls over gently on top of Sally and begins to make
love He rolls his hips easily and makes a gently but firm
stroke deep into Sally Sally flinches A pained expression
takes over Jack stops and looks at her curiously asking
questions with his eyes

SALLY
(whispering)
Its all right

Sally clenches her fist and bites her lip Jack does it
again Then again and again

SHORELINE - NIGHT
Jack walks down the waters edge carrying Sally in his arms

The rush and drag of the WAVES can be HEARD SPLASHING up on
the beach There are the lonely SQUAWKS of unseen SEAGULLS
circling in the air The moonbeams cast a silvery light
across the water

Jack walks out in the ocean till its up to his chest He

lets Sally down and she clings to him in the cold He com-
forts her A wave rolls in and splashes their naked bodies
Sallys cheeks are flushed There is a new deep look in her
eyes

SALLY

PART II

FALL 1965 WEST SWELL

I saw then that my topmost glory
was also my topmost grief”
Herman Melville
Moby Dick
“Surfings a disease not a sport”

Mrs Starburger

EXT BEACH

The waves are gray and monotonous -- they come from out of
the fog and a slate gray sea There is no horizon mist and
chill clings to the trashcans on the empty beach A few cars
and trucks whine by on the highway with their lights still
on A lonely gull picks at the trash in the fg

NARRATOR (V0)
The summer passed -- I dont seem to
remember them anymore -- I remembered
the fall and the coming of winter --
the west swell began to strengthen
-- it was a smell of change -- borne
of local winds and gales - Sometimes
it was a good swell and broke many
Places but it was a swell you
usually rode alone

PAN TO REVEAL the gaunt shape of a lifeguard tower in the
early fog -- the highway behind it A lifeguard truck below
it and the Lifeguard Captain waits huddled in a heavy jacket
A car drives up -- an older car but much more respectable
than the Makeshift Jack gets out -- he wears the county
lifeguard jacket He goes around to the window and kisses
Sally -- she drives back onto the highway Jack chats with
his Captain and takes some papers from him He climbs up the
ladder and opens his tower as the Captain drives off Barely
discernible in the cold fog -- the Point stretches before him

DISSOLVE TO
FULL SHOT - THE POINT - DAY

From the lifeguard tower the whole Point can be SEEN Jack
sits in the tower reading a notice -- across the top it
reads -- US ARMY DRAFT NOTICE Jack slowly turns from
the notice and looks down on the crowded beach below The
beach is different -- crowded with hordes of the new surfers
scruffy hair and blank expressions They all look the
same The Pit itself is changed -- its mostly empty -- a
few of the old crew sit and talk -- Stork Ostrich Panhead
Crusher -- but little kids and tourists sit there too --
its no longer their domain Hundreds of foam surfboards
line the old barbed wire fence RADIOS BLARE -- The Beach
Boys and The Beatles Jack folds up the notice and looks down
the ladder to see Kate washing the sand off her feet -- she
holds her little baby girl MELISSA Jack smiles at Melissa
who smiles back He starts down the ladder

JACK
Hi Melissa

KATE
Uncle Jack -- Uncle Jack

Melissa turns away teasing

KATE -
(continuing) ‘
Wheres Lance

JACK
I thought he was with you

KATE
No -- he wandered off last night --
he was pretty polluted -- Im
worried about him Jack

JACK
Hes a big boy --- someday hes
gonna find that out

He turns and sees a group of angry surfers following Mitch up
through the Pit Mitchs face is bloodied -- his hands are
bloodied

JACK
(continuing)
Oh -- shit -- not again

Mitch turns around and glares at the surfers following him

SURFER
You better not show up at County Line
man

MITCH

You want some too
The KID backs off Jack runs down between them

KID
That asshole ran my friend down and
then beat the shit out of him

The group walks up the Pit -- helping a bloodied friend

JACK
Keep going

They leave - Jack looks at Mitch -- Mitch shrugs

JACK
(continuing)
Youre gonna need some stitches

Kate carries over the first-aid kit -- Jack takes some gauze
out and starts to wrap it around Mitchs head

JACK
(continuing)
I dont like to be the one to tell you
Mitch but you cant keeo fighting
these guys you know Someday the
fucking police are gonna be down here

Mitch just looks out at the ocean

JACK
(continuing)
Shit -- I cant tell you what to do
just be easy ‘cause its my beach
and my ass Tell you the truth its
Lance thats bugging me

Mitch holds up his hand and looks at his knuckles

MITCH
I really screwed up my knuckles

JACK
Hes getting raspy Mitch -- hes
going too far Pissed in Bears
shop the other day - its not funny
anymore

MITCH
Hes drunk Hes a fucking drunk at
twenty-one -- Fuck it -- fuck it
Jack -- theres nothing we can do

EXT HIGHWAY

Lance is standing out in front of the traffic holding a
bright red beach towel He sags and reels in a drunken stu-
por A few cars pass Lance holds out the beach towel and
arches his back like a bullfighter A sports car whizzes be-
neath the tovel missing Lance by inches A cheer comes from
a crowd of surfers sitting at the curb Ole they cry
Lance waves to the spectators and then holds out the beach
towel for another pass

ANOTHER ANGLE
A GREMMIE whispers to his FRIEND on the curb
GREMMTE
(pointing)
Hey that guy used to be the hottest
surfer here

FRIEND
Youre putting me on

INT OLD PEOPLES CAR

An old couple drives along pulling a travel trailer The
OLD MAN at the wheel suddenly spots Lance arching into
another pass

OLD MAN
My God honey look

EXT HIGHWAY

Lance lets out with his crude animal noises and throws the
towel up in the air The towel comes down and completely
covers the windshield of the old peoples car The Old Man
Swerves up and over the curb and the travel trailer jack-
knifes behind him

INT LIFEGUARD TOWER

Jack hears the SCREECHING of BRAKES and comes flying out of
his tower

EXT HIGHWAY

Jack fights his way through the crowd and helps the old
couple from the car The old couple are badly shaken up
They cling to each other and the OLD WOMAN sobs

OLD WOMAN
We could have been killed

The Old Man holds her closer and starts to dry her tears

OLD WOMAN
(continuing)
We could have been killed

OLD MAN
(looking at trailer)
Look what they did -- Oh God look
what they did --

CLOSE - JACK
He just stares through the people at the old couple

JACK
Everybody -- stay back

The police are arriving -- SIRENS -- The Lifeguard Captain
pushes through -- Kate rushes up

KATE
Jack -- wheres Lance

Jacks eyes go cold he turns back into the crowd

EXT THE FENCE

Lance is slumped against the fence in a state of shock Jack
walks down through the Pit -- his eyes pinned on Lance --
people get out of his way Lance tries to ignore him Jack
walks up and stands in front of him They just stare at each
other for a long moment and then just the trace of a grin
crosses Jacks face Jack smiles more relaxed

——— SS ——

Lance smiles back -- Jack laughs -- Lance ladughs and then
Jack slugs him full in the teeth -- Lance reels back into
the barbed wire -- Jack hits him again and he goes down
Jack stares at him -- Lance holds his mouth -- he feels
shattered -- and disgraced

JACK
(cold)
Youre ruining it for us all asshole

Lance looks away -- kids start to gather around

JACK
(continuing)
Get off this beach

Lance looks up at him bewildered Jack grabs Lances board
off the fence and throws it down in the sand in front of him

So Lance Johnson the greatest surfer to ride The Point picks
up his board in front of all the beach and leaves in shame

INT STARBURGER

Jack bashes through the door hes dressed in jeans and his
lifeguard jacket -- has a wetsuit over his arm He looks
around sees Sally taking an order - walks over and inter-
rupts her

JACK
Im going north -- youll have to
get a ride home

SALLY
Jack -- Howd you get off

JACK
Good swell up there -- Ventura --
maybe Rivermouth or Overhead

SALLY
Whats wrong

JACK
Cant stay here -- thats all

He turns his face from her -- hes really disturbed -- goes
for the door

JACK
(continuing)
Cant stay here anymore

The door slams -- hes gone But he dropped something a
paper -- Sally picks it up -- its his draft notice

EXT ROADSIDE - DAY

Jack drives along a deserted frontage road-next to the beach
He slows and pulls up next to a signthat reads WARNING --
DANGEROUS RIP TIDES - NO LIFEGUARD ON DUTY He gets out of
the car goes and pulls his surfboard from the back angrily

BEACH

Jack comes to the top of the sand dune and stops He looks
down on a lonely beach He has come many times before each
time seeking solace But never has the turmoil been so
Strong The hurt the anger the confusion eat away at his
soul like a tide And now to confront it all He looks to
the sea for an answer

He watches the churning ocean boil up the berm and rip and
tear at the beach Butterflies swarm in his stomach An icy
fear shakes him at the roots The ROAR of the OCEAN like
the echoing sea of his own mind a haunting unknown mystery
Bear had said it To ride alone -- do it alone

Jack takes off his coat almost without knowing He pulls a
bar of wax from his pocket kneels down and begins to rub it
slowly methodically onto the deck of his board

He stands up rubbing his shoulders trying to ward off the
chill He looks out and sees a wave gather its strength
Slowly building building and then toppling forward with
tremendous force

OCEAN

Jack kneels on his board and struggles to paddle out through
the grinding shorebreak Riptides boil beneath him The
current sweeps him south He punches through a breaking wave
and is shocked by its icy sting His head aches from the
cold

There is a place over the reef where the waves focus They
are thick powerful waves that form into wedging peaks peel-
ing off quickly both left and right They roll out of the
fog in rhythmic sets each one a little bigger than the one
before it But now theres a lull A miracle hush has fal-
len on the ocean Jack paddles over to the reef and waits

A huge set of waves begins to creep out of the fog He hops
back up on his knees and begins to paddle The wave looks
mean and unforgiving Jack strokes up its face barely mak-
ing it over ‘

The next wave approaches and Jack jockeys for position He
tries for it He stares down a steepening face The wave
hits a reef and stands up vertical Jack freezes He sits
back on his board and lets the wave go by It peels off
without him and Jack sinks deeper into his depression

DISSOLVE TO

ANOTHER ANGLE

Another wave moves in across the milky surface He waits for
it resigned He grits his teeth and whips his board around
Hes got to do it Two strokes and hes hurtling down the
face and drives to the bottom He rides stiffly awkwardly
but survives the drop Hes blown out a hole that spits and
grinds overhead

DISSOLVE TO
OCEAN

Jack scratches back out to the lineup The next wave an un-
dulating mass rolls through the water toward Jack He sli-
thers into position

The take-off is late He fades left Purposely he plunges
himself into jeopardy waiting until the last possible moment
He hops to his feet and stands in the face of danger He de-
fies the ocean rips his way through the gnarl Theres
style and grace and flow and timing Total concentration
Jack flies out of a turn and then ieans into another He ex-
plodes through chunks of wave and hisses down a cavern

The next wave is his he feels connected One last ride He
grabs it and powers to the bottom The energy surges beneath
his board The wave hovers above him He squeezes off his

turn and races back up the face His hair flies in the wind

Jack works the inside Each turn blends into the next
Theres strength and aggression He streaks across a section
just before it closes Hes up and down skiddering through
the soup The wave folds

DISSOLVE TO
BEACH

A dark figure is making its way down the sand dunes Jack
leaves -- alone

FULL SHOT - BEARS SHOP

stoked out of all sensibility The SOUNDS of ELECTRIC SANDERS
from the back room compete with the RADIO Playing Green
Onions” by Booker T and the MGs Bear the tycoon stands
by racks of wetsuits and swimming trunks smoking a Cuban
cigar He wears a tuxedo jacket and an old TAILOR is making
alterations

labors

Bear turns around and suddenly notices Lance standing at the
door He looks bad but hes made an effort to clean himself
up -- his hair is combed -- his shirt tucked in -- none of
the little grems that sit against the wall recognize him --

boards

gasps and nudges her neighbor

Trash blows in the cold morning wind -- a few people wander
about

LANCES CAR

Lance drives his 40 Ford Mitch Waxer and Mickey are with
him they drive through the dark shadows imposed by the tall
buildings -- past bums and drunks who stumble about or sleep
against alley walls Trash and filth are abundant the air
is thick and heavy -- cars begin to fill the streets as
people come to work Stop-lights flash -- carloads of Mexi-
can families trundle by -- poor black children stand on
street corners jeering at passersby This is inland most
people live here -- Lance and the others do not its like a
foreign country to them The drive slowly by the US Army
Induction Center looking it over carefully All kinds of
kids their own age are lined up outside or spill out of long
green buses They drive by looking the situation over
Their faces are grim and resolved

DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOWNTOWN STREET

He has a three or four-day growth -- he rubs motor oil and
dirt into his beard and hair then wipes his hands on his
tattered shirt He puts on a pair of the worst looking rot-
ten old bums shoes that are imaginable -- he has been cul-
tivating the socks for a month

CLOSE SHOT - WAXER

He begins combing his hair in a bouffant pompadour Mickey
hands him rouge with which he carefully shadows his cheeks
All of these actions are done with clipped military precision
-- like a squad of commandos checking their battle gear and
weapons

BACK TO LANCE

He finishes tightening the polio brace -- pulls his pants leg
down over it in brisk motion -- stands up

fish from an oily paper bag -- puts it in his pocket -- Mickey
carefully rubs a bag full of rotten garbage across his back

“pours the meager contents in his hands and Slaps his face with

it like after-shave lotion

unbuttons his shirt

FADE IN

EXT OCEAN - LATE AFTERNOON

A winters day at the Point A shadowy figure of a man ona
surfboard rides deep in the pocket of a wave A long dark
wall on the verge of oblivion stretches out before him The
waves fringe is ripped away by an icy wind

NARRATOR
The north swell was cold and lonely
and dangerous It was a powerful swell
that marched down the coast in the dead
of winter Only the real surfers dared
to ride it back then

ANOTHER ANGLE

A bay full of waves The long dark lines roll in from far
around the Point The sky is grey and puffy The water is
steel-blue turning to green as the waves break Wetsuit-clad
surfers carve tracks down the cascading walls of water

NARRATOR
We used to ditch school and go down
to The Point and watch it break I
remember late in the evening
hovering over a fire waiting for the
last waves And before it was dark
we would go out and ride We were
like dancing silhouettes framed by
the evening waves

EXT BEACH

Young men huddle around a small fire shivering as they try
to warm their naked shins Japanese fisherwen dig through
the tide pools A lone surfer scampers over the rocks chas-
ing his lost board

NARRATOR
I remember the light ocean breezes and
the crisp winter days and the low tide
afternoons But now it all seemed
to be behind us The change wasnt in
the beach or the rocks or the waves
it was in the people And it was a
change we couldnt control People
went away and cans back changed Some
got married some moved inland and
some searched for a new spot Some
died Ostrich went to jail and God
knows what happened to Crusher

EXT STARBURGER

The old Starburger looks lonely and sad Windows are
boarded up and the outside paint is chipped Newspapers and
trash have blown in and collected against the side of the
building A loose shutter flaps noisily in the wind Through
a crack in the boards a dust-covered counter empty shelves
and a dirty floor Lugubrious reminders of an era like the
graffiti hand-printed on the outside wall SURFERS RULE --
PRAY FOR SURF

A big semi zooms by the abandoned cafe A friendly truck
driver who would have stopped in for coffee Beyond the
broken neon sign the contour of The Point a gift of nature
sucking in waves and causing them to peel off down the cove
Parked along the highway are many cars and many surfers --
they have long wild hair and psychedelic designs on their
surfboards They are the cosmic children of the new era

NARRATOR (V0O)
With the change in times even Lucy
had changed The old crew scattered
and she lost her role as counselor
and mother confessor She sold the
Starburger to some hippies and
headed north for a resting place
As for the three friends nobody knew
much about them They just didnt
come down to the beach anymore

Some cemeteries have a friendly down-home feeling like the
Southern graveyards with the slanting tombstones and the
sentimental inscriptions but this one is strictly military
Row after row of identical white grave markers stretch out
into the grass-covered hills converging into geometric
shapes The grey overcast sky and the little old lady plac-
ing flowers on a lost ones grave make for a stark lonely
setting

A volley of RIFLE SHOTS REVERBERATES across the cemetery
Three times they CRACK breaking the doleful silence

PEOPLE AT GRAVESITE

A squadron of military personnel stand straight and stern be-
side an open grave and a flag-covered casket Their ex-
pressions cold and impersonal The firing squad stands with
their rifles still aimed in the air They drop their rifles
in unison and an unseen bugler plays a heart-breaking TAPS

Across the grave is a minister head bowed and holding a
Bible

Beside him are a MAN and woman dressed in dark clothes They
watch helplessly as two pallbearers remove the flag from the

casket and begin to fold it military-style The pallbearers

hand the flag to the woman and she breaks down in tears

Off to the side by himself is Lance He looks as though he
has been through his own war and it has left its mark on him
He stands with his arms folded and stares despairingly into
the open grave

ANOTHER ANGLE

The couple walks slowly away from the grave The woman
clutches the flag and sobs Lance catches up with them

LANCE
Im sorry Waxer was one of my best
friends

You knew Jim

the old pier The large neon sign still stands but the word
Starburger has been painted over and replaced by the word
Cosmic Hippie types with long matted hair tattered vel-
vet dresses and shabby Levis with embroidered patches hang
around out front

INT COSMIC CAFE

The decor of the Cosmic Cafe is early hash house mixed with
psychedelia There are still the tables and the counter and
the pictures of old-time movie stars hanging on the wall be-
hind the grill But now the old pictures are accompanied by
posters of Meher Baba and Jimi Hendrix A health food menu
is handpainted on a chalk board More hippies sit at the
counter and twitch in time to the cosmic SOUNDS of RAVI
SHANKAR

Crazy Kate sits alone at a table near the door She looks
like the same Kate but more pulled together She wears a
straight but sharp-looking outfit Incense smoke billows
from a small burner in the middle of her table She looks
around impatiently and fans the smoke from her face

the letter in his hand He sits down at the table with
Kate For a moment they just look at each other

the classic old suit Kate wears an elegant evening dress
and an upswept hairdo She holds Lances arm This is a
special occasion for both of them They radiate excitement
and anticipation Melissa who is now five years old
marches along beside Lance looking up at him admiringly

They come to the front entrance where a man is dressed in a
formal ushers uniform Beside him is a big poster propped
up on an easel “BRUCE BAYNES LIQUID DREAMS PREMIERE

hands them to the usher and walks inside

INT THEATER LANCES Pov

The plush lobby is jammed with surfers wearing long hair
tie-dyed tank shirts bead chokers and fuzzy Fu Manchu
growths on their chins They stand around in little groups
haunched over putting on an air of super-cool Their eyes
are glazed and expressionless

Sprinkled among the crowd are the new Big Names There are
David Nuuiwa Mike Purpose Jay Riddle and Gerry Lopez

They look more like rock stars than they do surfers Their
followers huddle around them hanging on their every word

ANOTHER ANGLE

Lance searches through the crowd trying to spot a familiar
face Ostrich Fly Crusher Enforcer His proud ex-
pression changes He looks uncomfortable and strangely out
of place —

The surfers look at him but then dart their eyes away They
are cold and indifferent

Lance spins around and sees BRUCE BAYNE about thirty and

watching the movie ROCK MUSIC BLARES Wave after wave
flashes across the screen

Gerry Lopez tall and slinky drops gracefully down the face
of a treacherous Hawaiian wave

NARRATOR (V0
(Baynes voice)
Gerry Lopez thunders down another
pipeline bone-crusher

Gerry skitters to the bottom and leans into a beautiful sweep-
ing turn The ocean caves in behind him A magnificent tube
grinds before him Like a cat Gerry slinks into position
finding the perfect blend of man and wave He streaks

across the translucent face extracting speed and power
Savagely he claws at the explosion of mist and spray

143 ANOTHER ANGLE

The surfers in the audience stand up and bellow at the top of
their lungs They wave their arms and stamp their feet as
they watch their hero narrowly escape the gaping jaws of
another tube

Melissa squirms around excitedly on Lances lap She looks
amazed

“ON THE SCREEN

An airplane flies over the clouds And then a MONTAGE SHOW-
ING beach activity down at the Point The crowd calms down

NARRATOR
After the north shore season Gerry and
I flew to California to catch some
Summer waves at the Point The Point
has always been a training ground for
great surfers It is the place where
hotdogging was innovated by guys like
Lance Johnson Jack Barlow and Mitch
Smith They were the pioneers The
first ones to develop the modern style
We bring you the great Lance Johnson

On the screen Lance rides along on a four-foot wave at The
Point The section builds in front of him and he walks
casually up to the nose and hangs ten

NARRATOR
(continuing)
Lance was famous for his casual style
He made walking the board look as easy
s walking down the sidewalk

Kate looks over at Lance and smiles proudly Melissa squirms
some more

MELISSA

Is that you Daddy Is that you

Lance looks around self-consciously The surfers surrounding
him look bored Nobody cheers

ON THE SCREEN

Lance fades into another wave He swings his board around
right and locks into perfect trim

NARRATOR
Lance was one of the best Here he is
getting another unbelievable nose ride

On the screen Lance stands casually on the nose He waiks
back and glides easily over the top of the wave Nobody
cheers

ANOTHER ANGLE
Lance looks embarrassed The surfers around him twitch rest-

lessly in their seats A surfer takes a long drag off a
smoldering joint

Gerry Lopez takes off on a nicely-formed Point wave The
loud ROCK MUSIC BEGINS TO BLARE Pandemonium breaks out in
the audience

And now back to the present Gerry
Lopez tries his luck at The Point

On the screen Gerry whips his board around in a series of
fast turns He squats down and powers through the soup

ANOTHER ANGLE

The surfers sitting behind Lance whistle and cheer Melissa
hops up and down on his lap her eyes glued to the screen

MELISSA
Look Daddy look

Lance is overwhelmed by sadness and hurt I was a king
That was our place What do they know What do they

EXT THE POINT - DAY

It is a cold blustery day The wind howls from out of the
north Theres a moderate swell running but the wind blows
across the waves and ruffles their edges The sky is over-
cast and the ocean is grey and uninviting Surfers pull up
in their cars check the surf for a moment and then drive
away It is the kind of day where you can still find soli-
tude down at the beach

Kate sits down near the bottom of the Pit wrapped in a blan-
ket Melissa runs up giggles happily and hands her a hand
ful of seashells Melissa runs back down to the waters edge
where she has a partially-built sand castle She picks up
her shovel and starts to pack on sand A wave hisses up the
berm and flattens her creation The sand castle dissolves
into the sea Melissa giggles and starts scooping up more
sand She looks up and suddenly her expression changes

She sees something coming in the distance

MELISSA‘S POV
A dark figure a MAN in an overcoat is walking along the
shoreline towards Melissa He comes closer Closer The

Man is dressed in a military uniform His thick shiny boots
leave deep impressions in the wet sand

97

The Man comes closer and stops casting a cold shadow over
Melissa She stares at his boots then at his knees Slowly
She looks up his body until finally she reaches his face

The Man looks dark and weathered But beneath the shadows
there is a kindly expression

MAN
Youre Melissa arent you Dont
you remember me Im your Uncle Jack

ANOTHER ANGLE

Melissa drops her shovel and nods open-mouthed Kate comes
running up and throws her arms around Jack Tears stream
down her face Melissa watches

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jack takes off his shirt and hands it to Kate He pulls a
Farmer John wetsuit up over his pale shoulders Kate folds
his shirt and places it on a neat pile with the rest of his
clothes Jack grabs a surfboard off the old barbed wire
fence He hesitates for a moment then puts the board back
down

JACK
Melissa I almost forgot I have
something for you

He goes to the pile of clothes and searches through a shirt
pocket He pulls out a shiny medal and hands it to Melissa
She stares at the medal sparkling in her hand

Thank you Uncle Jack

water Kate watches him and then her expression begins to
darken

forward and digs his hands deep into the water taking long
rhythmic strokes There is the familiar SOUND of little
ripples slapping the bottom of his board So good to be in

closed in his face His first reaction is rage He gets
ready to tear down the door but he catches himself He
jerks around The parrot squawks He marches away from the
apartment looking stunned

Jack stumbles up to Lances car and gets in He sets the
parrot down on the seat and then doubles over as if a burn-

fist and slams the dashboard The parrot squeals Jack

The apartment door opens and Sally and her husband walk out
They are both well-dressed and they smile happily as they

walk hand-in-hand up the walkway Sally looks mature and

didnt think I could ever come home

clenches her fist and bites her lip hopelessly reaching for
what went before Jack leans into deep hard strokes sweat-

From the Pit --- through the gate - the point as weve never
seen it Great dark lines form on the horizon and march in
towards the shore They peel across the point with relent-
less force trying to tear at the very continent itself ‘The
old pier is shaken and jostles by each massive set The
beach itself is filled with people -- for the first time in
years -- they gather at the ripped edge of the sand where a
great cliff is being eroded They watch the drama of the
many surfers who rise for the biggest waves -- a chance to
perform -- a chance to distinguish themselves

MED SHOT - LIFEGUARD TOWER

In the fg a young surfer is carried on a stretcher being
given oxygen by two lifeguards An AMBULANCES mournful
WAIL can be HEARD in the distance Another surfers arm
has been broken by his board It is twisted and turning
grey-blue -- save the bright blood that runs down out of
his wetsuit He staggers to the lifeguard tower still
carrying his board

DIFFERENT ANGLE

The lifeguards are frantic - our VIEW PULLS BACK to the
CAPTAIN talking on his radio

LIFEGUARD CAPTAIN
Yeah you better get someone from
City then because no ones stupid
enough to go in down there -- These
kids are gonna go in no matter how
big it gets -- Yeah -- I think
Burnside is looking into a Police
order to keep ‘em out if it keeps
on building

Our VIEW PULLS BACK FURTHER as other surfers and young kids
gather around the lifeguard station looking wide-eyed at
their wounded comrades or listening for any further exciting
bits of news

183

Behind all these sits a lone KID leaned back against the fence
watching the drama below A large set isrolling in and some
terrific surfing is being done The Kid stands up and stares
as the set pours through lie hardly notices that next to him
the County GARBAGE COLLECTOR has stopped what hes doing

and stares at the set

KID
All-fucking time

The Garbage Collector keeps watching but pulls the full
plastic hag from the trash can -- sets it on the ground and
starts putting a new hag in

KID
(continuing)
All time -- Jesus All fucking
time

GARBAGE COLLECTOR
Thats the lemon next to the pie

The Kid turns suddenly and looks at a grizzled man bordering
on middle age but still a vital glean in his eyes -- Bear

KID -
What

BEAR (GARBAGE COLLECTOR)
Thats nothing -- its gonna get
bigger

The Kid is suddenly fascinated -- doesnt know what to make
of a garbage collector giving him a surf report

KID
Why you say that man - thats hot
-- I mean it dont get any bigger
than that around here

Bear smoothes out the plastic liner -- pulls the edges
around the top of the can

BEAR
You been out there

KID
I was out this morning man it
was sooo hot but its hairy

Bear finishes and stands up - looks out across the vast
expanse of sea -- the set is over

183 BEAR
How big was it yesterday a

KID
It was four maybe five -- it came
up this morning -- just started
pumping man --- sets of six and
eight -- its gotta be ten now

BEAR

The waves were -- real far apart
KID

BEAR

- and the sets -- they were long
sets -- ten -- twelve waves to a
set - now theres more -- maybe

water is cold -- cold deep water

KID

Bear slings the bag of rotting trash over his shoulder

BEAR

be here tomorrow You gonna go out

KID

BEAR
You may be crying for your mother
in the lineup

He turns and starts back towards the garbage truck -- The
kid turns -- he must have an answer

KID

BEAR
No Im just a garbage collector
-- I dont give a shit

A picture of Sally -- tan laughing surfboards leaning
against a fence behind her -- long ago and far away The
picture is grainy and old but it has a frame around it

JACK (0S8)
Huge waves batter south shore --
Oahu - Biggest waves in 20 vears
- expected to hit California beaches
early Tuesday

Our VIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE another picture of a large dark
wave with a rider streaking across it -- simple things on

a desk -- pencils -- field glasses --- a State Forest Rangers
hat -- maps on the walls -- a telescope and finally Jack
reading a newspaper On the front page is a photo of a

huge wave battering the Hawalian coast Jack leans back in
his chair looking out a window over endless brush-covered
hills He wears his uniform -- starched and neat -- his
hair is short -- his face older and more weather-beaten

The PHONE RINGS He picks it up

JACK

(continuing into

Lance I was just going to call
you - Yeah -- So this is it --
Bear never said it would be a south

I guess we go tomorrow -- lets
just meet in the Pit at eight
and get it done early

He looks out over the endless expanse of dry scrubbly hills
in the distance is the vague haze of the city and little dots
represent the limit to which it has pushed

JACK

Okay -- see you then

He hangs up the phone and just stares out the window for
a while his hand rests next to the picture of the wave and
Sally

A lonely stretch of road Lights wind around a bend and
grow -- Finally the car can the DISCERNED -- a white 1955
Porsche Speedster by no means restored rattles by

CLOSE - CAR

Mitch is at the wheel bundled up a scarf around his neck
like an aviator -- a madgleam in hiseyes his surfboard
old and yellow in the seat next to him His face is lined
and leathery -- his hair beginning to recede but his eyes
are the same He drives into the turns with recklessness --
drifting and screeching smiling to himself as he flirts
with the edge of a cliff

DIFFERENT ANGLE

He sees a figure ahead hitchhiking The figure grows in his
lights -- a young GIRL in a heavy coat He pulls over and
slides to a stop in the gravel -- dust rises She is a young
innocent-looking girl with dark hair and dark eyes

MITCH
You need a ride
GIRL
Los Angeles Im going to Los

Angeles

Mitch opens the door --- she looks at the surfboard lie
looks at her -- finally she climbs in on top of it
uncomfortably and closes the door le accelerates violently

MITCH

You dont look like a hitchhiker
GIRL

Im going to LA to find somebody

I knew

He looks over at her

MITCH

Yeah -- so am I

She looks uncomfortable

MITCH
Lean back

She leans back against the surfboard - her hair blows in

night oo

DISSOLVE TO
THE PIER - NIGHT

Lance walks along the highway there is a thick mist in the
air -- churned up ocean from the pounding swells their ROAR
can be HEARD over the traffic Lance comes to the entrance
of the old pier -- boarded up and barb wired with signs
proclaiming danger - condemned structure For some reason
all these years they let it stand

DIFFERENT ANGLE

Lance looks out into the darkness and even the shadows can
discern a giant wall moving towards him -- its crest touching
the bottom of the pier He gasps at such a sight -- as if he
were seeing a tidal wave The shadowy silent wall towers
shaking the pier and cracks visciously at its crest and
thunders over The ground seems to shake and the air is
thick Lance hesitates and looks into the night for

another monster -- nothing but biackness He climbs over

the barbed wire and barricade and starts down the pier

CLOSE SHOT - LANCE

He walks carefully looking around A haze hangs over
everything - as if out here there is no more land -- no
more city -- no more air -- no more life -- just ocean

The wood CREAKS under him -- the whole pier sways and shifts
with each passing wave All these years they left it here
and now the ocean will finish the job Not yet anyway

The farther he goes into the foggy blackness the more he
feels he can never get back Finally he comes near the

end -- where the Bears shop once was He stops

VOICE
You showed up

He turns -- squints -- in the Shadows is a figure leaning
against the burned pilings Ue steps closer -- its Rear
LANCE
Youre drunk

BEAR
So what

A huge wave passes underneath them almost lifting the pier

BEAR
(continuing)
Can you feel it -- its wonderful --
so clean and pure -- a great swell

-- Feel it
The pier shakes as the waves crash

BEAR
(continuing)
It feels so good out here -- almost
like a girl -- one after another --

Lance locks around

Lance sees it -- the long sleek wooden board -- Bears

BEAR
(continuing)
I brought it for you

-- reshaped honed and perfected -- waiting
BEAR

(continuing)
Its yours now

Lance goes and picks it up

He points

BEAR
(continuing)
All these years --- only a few things
mattered -- the thing that mattered
most was knowing how you three felt
about ine -- that you respected me
-- that Id given something to you

to the board

BEAR
(continuing)
Its yours now - I taught you to
turn and to trim -- to cut hack and
stay high in the sections --

BEAR (CONTD)
I cant teach you any more about
surfing -- but I can tell you
Lance -- the most important thing
is that you give something to them
-- something more than surfing --
that you pass something to those that
are following no matter what you think
of ‘em -- thats how you draw the
line

He feels it under his arm -- sleek and smooth heavy but
well balanced ‘The same as all the times he picked it up
in the shop or ran his hands down its rails The pier
buffets and shakes underneath them as another crashing
wall of water explodes He turns sharply to the figure
in the shadows

Whatre you doing Bear Whatre
you doing like this -- Come on hack

Lance walks away into the haze back towards the lights of
the highway The pier shakes repeatedly underneath him

LANCES CAR

Lance puts the board carefully in the »ack of his old £1
Camino He hears a great RUMBLING and looks up as a

tremendous set pours through -- he cant see -- just hears
it -- and he thinks -- just barely that he can hear Bear
laughing

LANCES APARTMENT DARKNESS

It is the hour before dawn when the sky turns a deep blue
in the east -- the loneliest hour - the hour when most
births take place -- and most deaths A light is on in
Lances apartment -- we SEE him briefly at the window --
then the light goes off -- he opens the door walks to the
garage

CLOSER - GARAGNR

He opens the door -- the thin blue light of dawn barely
illuminates a few objects -- one gleams on the ground --

the board He walks over to it -- stands and looks at its
dimly outlined shape for a while Its cold this morning
and he rubs his arms He looks shifts his weight but cant
take his eyes fron the hoard Finally he kneels down next
to it

CLOSER STILL LANCE

He runs his hand over the gleaming deck -- itll have to be
waxed carefully so its rough and sure -- so that theres no
way his feet could Slip on its surface Then his hand goes

lightly and then firmly as if to generate a sexual response
Suddenly he senses something and looks up

DIFFERENT ANGLE

a robe Melissa leans against her sleepy Lance looks
into Kates eyes - she looks back into hin

CLOWE SHOT - MITCHS CAR

Parked alone along the side of the highway ‘Mitch is
asleep slumped behind the wheel - the little dark-haired
Girl is asleep on his shoulder -- the hoard is laying
across the hood lle stirs and his eyes open He hears

the SOUND -- sees the mist on his windshield -- feels the
dampness in their clothes She stirs and opens her eyes
looking at him His head turns and he sees what he heard
Great swells rise out of the sea and crash violently on the
rocky cliffs -- dark lines stretch to the horizon

DAWN

The sun hasnt risen but the first rays of light filter
over the highway -- the point -- the massive grey sea

FULL SHOT - WAVE
An enormous wall of water -- drawing up -- rising --
rising -- towering until it FILLS the entire FRAME It is
dark blue almost black menacing and all powerful pulling
strands of white up with it It finally turns over on itself
cascading down with the texture of wet cement and explodes
into white chaos

BIG WEDNESDAY
FULL SHOT - BEACH
The kids lined up along the shoreline

203

Some jump up and down to stay warm others sit huddled
together Girls hold on to their guys -- staring rubbing
each other disconcertedly -- trying to stay warm -- trying
to keep in touch with themselves their bodies the land
all that theyve known -- trying to stay warm

204 CLOSER

Their faces are drawn almost impas3ive in the early light
Their eyes are blank the jaws slack -- No one wants to show
too much emotion --- Decisions are being made -- inside --
deep inside where nobody goes -- Do I want to ride DoTI
have to ride Its too big for me -- Ive been in bigger
but something is different here -- Something is loose --
uncontrolled - ilo -- I dont have to ride -- Im no coward
but Imno fool

205 FULL SHOT - THE LINE-UP

Huge walls move towards the land and the few surfers out
there scramble over them A rider drops in -- the crowd
gasps -- its huge He carves off the bottom in a series

of long turns but the face of the wave is choppy and closing
fast - He doesnt make the inside sections and tries vainly
to straighten out but the onrushing mountain of soup crushes
over him -- explodes on Only a few will ride today -- on
days such as these it is never really more than a few

206 THE BEACH

And these few will he special A tall lean dark-haired
young man walks quietly with his small purple board with
a yellow lightning bolt across it Several others follow
him -- an entourage -- the crowd mumbles as he passes

KID
Its Lopez

OTHER KID
That aint him --

ANOTHER
Yeah it is -- Ive seen him in the
islands -- thats Gerry Lopez

Lopez passes - walking towards the shorebreak -- Its so

big today that hell have to sprint out along the pier
Lifeguard trucks roar up SIRENS WAILING -- the lifeguards
get out and run down towards the pier -- somebody is drowning
or has already drowned -- many of the crowd follow -- theyve
made their decisions -- theyll not leave their warm girls
and beach today -- let others provide the sport -- They
dont mind blood

CLOSE SHOT - LIFEGUARD TOWER

A young lifeguard like Jack used to be is on the Phone --
he is drawn and serious --- hes wet and his shoulder has
been injured

MED SHOT CROD

A crowd has surrounded the lifeguard truck The guards are
moving somebody to the truck - the crowds are thick -- they
dont know whether to see the victims or watch the battle

at sea

LIFEGUARD CAPTAIN
All right -- lets have some room

Get out of the way

They carry a young girl on a stretcher -- her mouth covered

Clothes are being stripped off revealing pale skin still
well muscled and the old faded surfing trunks -- boards

are waxed SHOTS of each of their faces Finally the water

off little whirlpools at the end of the stroke The nose

FULL SHOT - SHOREBREAK

One by one they battle through to torn up shorebreak along
the pier Its a lull but the waves are still six feet
Jack bashes through -- the cold water immersing him for

a second then letting him go

DIFFERENT ANGLE - THE CHANNEL

They are free of the shorebreak into the clean blue water
of the outer ocean Paddling rhythmically feeling tight
muscles loosen The pier behind them - heading for the
point Their faces are determined almost grim Jack
looks over at Mitch he smiles -- Jack smiles back for a
brief instant they crack up -- they cant believe it --
here they are - again

CONTIWUED

Lance cracks up too -- They pull abreast of each other
paddling almost in unison -- their arms strong as they ever
were giggling and laughing -- finally Mitch looks out
to sea ‘

MITCH
Outside

ANOTHER ANGLE

We SEE an enormous wall building -- building across the
horizon -- moving towards us sleek dark and glassy rising
in its greatness as if an animated thing -- more than

animal It draws closer relentlessly shuttering out all

else -- suddenly the three pass AROUND US -- Jack on one

side -- Mitch and Lance on the other --- paddling rhythmic and
undisturbed right for the great wall -- together three
abreast they start up its immensity as it starts to crack

as its top

THE WAVE

From behind the wave -- all three surfers break through
the crest in quick succession -- bursting through in a
shower of silvery spray and vaulting through open space
for a second then crashing down into the f£g and continuing
their stroke The wave hisses over behind them and explodes

CLOSE SHOT - LANCE

He looks down the lineup to the point as another horrendous
wall folds towards them Mitch and Jack are inside of him
and beyond he can see a surfer on the wall -- insignificantly
small but streaming a sinuous vapor trail of spray as he
shakes through the sections The rider is good Lance
looks across the others as they start up the massive face
turning concave - watching the surfer on his small

purple board in the gaping mouth of thetube -- rising

and falling -- the sledgehammer lip just missing nim Lopez
Then they go up and burst through again in another shower

of silver The wave and Lopez are gone behind

FULL SHOT - POINT

They paddle into the final lineup on the point -- Its been
war here and this is a battleground but now the set has
passed and everything is smooth and calm The sky is slate
grey and the sea almost black -- lesser swells undulate
beneath them Twenty or so surfers sit here in this rarified
atmosphere They bob up and down - eager eyes scan the
horizon waiting -- waiting The surfers are all older than

‘kids -- at least in their early 20s mostly -- a few younger

-- their faces are drawn and pale from the cold water -- most
wear wetsuits of some kind They dont talk or gesture --
its as if each one were here alone

131
MED SHOT - THE GROUP

The three friends Stop -- they are here “ now soon it
will come -- the battle will begin again But here and
now its peaceful -- serene peace that each of them has
never known The sky seems blue above them for second
The sun seems to briefly shine -- seagulls by the hundreds
Circle and swirl above the Point -- their Cries are
Plaintive ang haunting The air becomes Crisp -- a breath
of offshore wind -- Sweet scented from the land It is
peaceful -- go peaceful -- at this moment they all know in
their hearts why this ocean this “yreat tide beating
heart of the earth is called Pacific

JACK
Lets kinda keep an eye on each
other

MITCH

If -- anyones in trouble - well
fuck it -- wholl know

JACK
Well try

Suddenly a SURFER starts to paddle ANOTHER turns his
board sharply then others

SURFER
Outside

ANOTHER
Oh Jesus

STILL ANOTHER
Outside Look at that mother

greater horizon Its as if the set before was nothing
compared to-this one

MONTAGE FACES
The faces of the surfers -- their eyes widen as they dig

in -- one chatters to himself uncontrollably -- another
breathes furiously -- a few are caln resolute -- most are

awed and terrified in equal measure They churn furiously

on their small boards -- scratching for the onrushing
mountains -

222 CLOSE SHOT - LANCE

Lance is different -- he has come alive -- his eyes gleam --
hes scared but he knows what this is -- how long hes
waited -- the big wood board surges ahead of the others -
hell have plenty of time to clear the first waves -- pick
his -- be in the right place

223 CLOSE - MITCH AND JACK

Jack is breathless -- awed -- Mitch the savage is
exhilarated beyond belief The wave looms over them -- its
going to be close -- Lance is ahead already clearing the crest

MITCH
Wow - Jack Real waves

He churns up the face and crashes the cracking crest with
Jack close behind

224 CLOSE - OTHER SURFERS

Some are not so lucky -- the big boards paddle faster and
glide further than the new small ones -- A few are not

going to make it Either this wave or the next will clean
them A young surfer starts paddling up the concave face -
halfway up he abandons the board to swim through Another
strokes desperately but knows he cant clear it He screams
in fear as he is sucked up into the crest and back over

the falls The wave explodes -- tons of water pour over

225 FULL SHOT - LINEUP

This is it -- what surfers call the lineup that no mans

land between safety and disaster where you make the choice --
draw the line and go for it A battleground like in a war
Surfers yell to their friends about outside waves -- others
sprint towards the channel Decision must be made quickly

-- this one -- the next one Is it bigger outside Is he
going on that one Once a wave has heen picked and
committed to theres no turning back If the surfer fails
to catch the wave the one behind will get him Con-
sequently in this scramble many times two or even three
surfers catch the wave at once -- Only one has a chance

of making it on a day like today They scream at each other

SURFER
Coming down -- Coming down

The wave passes -- the fate unknown -- another and another
come past Jack Lance and Mitch know the strategy well
- they maneuver -- wait -- sprint -- twenty years of
surfing pays off as much here as on the wave Finally it
looks clear 7

CLOSE - THE GROUP

An ominous wall - a mountain of water is bearing down on
them
MITCH
This is it -- Mine

Jack paddles by

JACK
Go - Go Ride

Mitch spins around as hes being sucked up the face -- the
board drops away as he comes to his feet in the vertical
drop and hurtles down the wave crouching at the bottom and
banking into a smoking turn as the wave pitches out

DIFFERENT ANGLES - OTHERS

Now its contagious -- Jack wheels around - strokes driving
his arms in deep -- he surges ahead the board flying out
into seeming space and down the great rising wall -- Stay
high after the initial turn Trim The first sections are
thick and heavy -- they loom over and are gone in an instant
His feet feel sure avain

FULL - LANCE

Now its Lances turn -- the great wall -- the best of the
set - smooth and green builds behind him He looks over
his shoulder at it -- almost saluting it arrogantly -- turns
the board - strokes hard -- moving now -- faster -- faster
-- the wall surges him up -- drawing him towards the crest
and then the boards speed takes over -- He rockets ahead
white plumes of vapor heing left hehind -- down -- down to
the left -- a flagrant display of daring -- the better to
bring off his turn -- he arches his back -- his legs wide
apart -- banked at the flat bottom as he hears the
thunderous CRACK overhead -- Not for an instant does he
flinch or duck-- he rides with the same proud dignity he
always had -- as if the waves were five foot instead of
fifteen or eighteen He rockets out of the turn tucks into
the hook and drives high into the first section -- It starts
to come over -- heavy and fast - he trims up staying high
“ the curl gains on him -- he stays high still until it
seems as if the whole wall is going to come over and at the
last moment he drops gaining the ultimate in speed and
tucks slightly -- the onrushing curl almost covers him from
sight -- he executes a searing turn at the bottom and comes
back into the light A few more driving sections -- staying
high -- the board holding and the wave is all but over --
one more massive unmakable section ahead and then the pier --
Hes gone the limit and so he smoothly rockets off over the
top

CLOSE - LANCE

He comes screaming over the wave and rides the big board
down the trough and into still water Hes made it Hes
done it Wie screams in joy and his legs buckle under him
and he falls unceremoniously into the water -- He surfaces
and pulls himself hack on the hoard --- Now the long paddle
back -- more - the day is his

MONTAGE - SURFING

Surfing like weve never seen it Mitch drives through
the sections slightly out of control -- savagely attacking
- making it -- Jack is the strategist -- careful perfect
placement -- incredible situations he seems to be lucky to
get out of -- using his head wherever he can But no one
“- no one at all rides like Lance All that he ever was
comes back -- he just doesnt ride these waves -- he makes
love to them Every move is sure and graceful -- every
position classically executed -- The timing is more than
exact -- he is riding on that very edge where he is so close
to disaster so thoroughly committed to his position that
he can only achieve greatness or die He is definitely
the best rider to ever dominate the Point

CLOSE SHOT - LANCE

He paddles back to the Point -- watches Jack as he carves
across the top and disappears as the wave goes by He
smiles to himself and paddles smoothly

DIFFERENT ANGLE

He gets to the Point at the end of a set The last wave

towers before him -- a scared KID sits in the channel and
watches as a crazy surfer spins around in the impact area
and makes a spectacular late takeoff -- Mitch

KID

Radical -- that guys so radical
LANCE

Having fun
KID

Im scared shitless -- but In
never gonna forget that I was

out here
LANCE
(smiles)
Go for it

He paddles on farther out on the Point long past the

safety of the channel and to the place where the steep

ride begins - It is strangely empty and quiet -- the last
set has cleared the Point -- only one surfer remains --
tall dark lean ona purple hoard with a yellow lightning
bolt Lance paddles up they look at each other and smile
The seagulls wheel around above them They dont bother

to look outside They know when the waves are coming
These two are relaxed calm they belong here

LOPEZ

LOPEZ
(continuing)

LANCE
Thank you -- Youre no punk yourself

A massive wall threatens them

LANCE
(continuing)

You want it i
LOPEZ

Thanks

He spins his board smoothly and takes off with effortless
grace

FULL SHOT - BDACH

The spectacle in the water has all eyes upon it The crowds
of surfers stare breathlessly out at the lineup The
lifeguards run up and down the beach or patrol in their
trucks doing all they can to keep people out of the water
and help those who are being washed in The last set has
taken its toll broken boards wash up on the rocks --

a surfer limps from the water coughing -- his friends
cluster around him - another surfer is helped to the
lifeguards holding his head

DIFFERENT ANGLE

They all watch Lopez ride -- he is magnificent -- flowing
smooth -- all that the new style can give but never breaking
the traditions of the old He is a complete surfer -- he
rides on the edge like Lance and it looks easy The crowd
mumbles and begins to hoot as he goes through a particularly
fine section

THE LINEUP LANCE

Suddenly Lance is alone He paddles over an enormous

wave and finds that he is alone - totally divorced from
the land and all those who live there There is no
recognizable time or space -- only the huge green back of
the wave that passed -- the yawning black face of the wave
approaching - the mists that hang over them -- and the
hundreds of seagulls wheeling above It is a world unlike
any other - chaos and beauty -- a desperate loneliness
and an intoxicating solitude Lance looks down the lineup
and sees no one - The inside is too far away -- perhaps a
few down there -- but right now the point waves are his

CLOSE - LANCE

He paddles with purpose -- as if being drawn by his own
particular destiny -- up - up over the great green wall and
on the other side he sees his wave A wave perhaps like

the others but a perfect wave -- enormous arrogant in its
beauty and dangerous He knows it the instant he sees it --
its his wave His holy grail that hes looked for all
these years

DIFFERENT ANGLE - WAVE

Sunlightseems to break through for an instant and turns

the monster into a mountain of deep blue - gathering itself
up hurling itself forward -- its top cracking and blowing
back white like a mane Lance spins around and strokes ---
deep and hard -- he is gathered up in the great waves
immensity -- carried up higher and higher as the huge wall
sucks out beneath him The off-shore wind holds him high --
impedes his rush down the face until the last minute and

by then the face is vertical almust concave He leaps

to his feet -- claws at the side of the wave -- knows he
must rip out a turn on the way down Its already coming
over - shutting out the sun - he falls - falls -- will
the fin hold Will it spin out It holds He has his turn

o barely scraping the bottom -- banking up -- a half step

- trim -- trim the board -- tuck in -- get higher in the
section -- the sun is gone -- the curl is breaking off over
his head -- there is a tremendous CRACKING SOUND as the wave
detonates behind him

CLOSE - LANCE

He tucks into trim -- his speed is unbelievable -- his
expression is mixed with fear -- awe -- anxiety -- and
grandeur He tucks in farther urging everything from his
board -- the first section is hollowing the wall ahead --
shadow passes over him - the lip of the curl narrowly
missing his shoulder Its so big -- hes never been in
so big a wave --- this far back

LANCES POV

The wall rushes up ahead - the land visible beyond -- The
wall rushes up and curls over our heads and shuts out

the sun and the arc of the curl gets tighter and tighter
until a span of green water is peeling off over our heads
This is called being in the “green room an experience
that happens only a few times in a surfers life and never
in such a big wave Inside the curl -- no longer visible
from the beach -- covered up by the immense roof of water --
the light of the land still visible ahead - the outrushing
wall curling -- curling The sound silent and all consumed
by the roar of the ocean -- Time is stretched and twisted
here - it can never be the same Seconds seem to take
hours and repeat themselves - Have I done this before -- I
just went by - I see myself -- I11 never be here again --
Ill never get out -- The onrushing wall curls overhead

On the beach hundredsof people are holding their breath -
are screaming -- are hooting -- they dont believe it --
but here it is strangely serene -- the people the land -
the sun -- the wave -- are all gone -- only the green light
and the freedom of speed Finally the eye of the wave
opens -- light begins to flood in The shadow passes
Cc

DIFFERENT ANGLE

Lance arches out of the tube in full trim using a hard rail
turn to gain the edge -- The board arches smoothly to the
top of the wave and he brings it around and down into
another turn the vapor spray sroking behind him Ahead
is the final unmakeable section -- Diocked by the pier --
the wave fattens here and grows tamer for an instant -- The
right time to get out -- Hes gone farther than any man

can go today

CLOSE SHOT - LANCE

He turns smoothly to the top of the great wave A change
in his expression Ne has made the wave - there is nothing
more Or is there -- nothing for a man but what of a god
In all of surfing one of the most beautiful and symbolic
maneuvers is the cutback -- a searing turn back from the
safety of the shoulder into the depths of the wave once
again It is an arrogant and dangerous move once more
hurling yourself into danger committing yourself to the
edge No one in all of surfing ever cut-back any better
than Lance and now his expression changes -- his foot drops
to the tail-block -- his arms wheel -- the board banks into
the face and back around down again into the blackness

He drives to the bottom

CLOSE SHOT - JACK
He looks for Lance - sees him go back - turns his board
CLOSE SHOT MITCH

He knows too - he ‘looks back as he approaches the lineup
- Looks hack down the long expanse of the inside at the
back of the great green wall

LANCE - THE WAVE

It throws out dark and black over him -- he drives into
his turn -- his trim -- hurtles across the wall in a
suicidal rush that can end only at the torn and jagged
pilings of the pier The wave wont let him even get that
far - it buckles and throws out along its length He has
one chance -- all of his force into one final turn -- one
turn to hurl him through the roof of the wave as it comes
over Up he drives -- Up -- up - at the last instant
kicking the hoard up so that it pierces the collapsing
Crest It stabs through clean and bursts into the air --
but he is hit flat by the full force of the wave and driven
down with the tons of water into the pier

FULL SHOT - WAVE - BOARD
All time is slowed -- the board breaks free into the light

and spins upward leaving a Sparkling silver trail -- finally
it falls back into the flat water beyond the wave

CLOSE SHOTS - JACK AND MITCH

They both see the board - they know what it means -- that
Lance didnt make it They turn --

LANCES POV

He is hurled down by the wave to its bottom but just before
the impact an ugly black piling thrusts up -- The wave
detonates and all is gone in its violence

FULL SHOT - HITCH

He scratches hard into a late takeoff on a lesser wave --
turns high -- drives through the end of the last section

CLOSE SHOT - JACK

He sees Mitch coming down -- turns and takes off in front

of him He drops straight down because the section is so
steep -- Hitch has the speed and expertly goes behind him
Jack turns off the bottom trims and comes out right behind
Mitch -- they now ride across the flat part of the wave
waiting for the pier section -- It builds into a wall --

Jack straightens off wisely and proves out towards the pier
before the wave can break violently but Mitch just rides
straight at it - going to the nose driving as far as he can
and diving off towards it as the wave folds and explodes

FULL SHOT - WATER

Now they are all at the mercy of the sea -- Jack has the
farthest to swim

CLOSE SHOT - JACK

He swims -- seemingly getting nowhere -- he can see Mitch
and Lance -- mere specks being dashed around the pier
Suddenly he enters the rip current which is the result of
all that water coming off the point -- its like a great
fast river and it carries him to the pier -- More waves
come -- walls of white water twelve feet high

THE PIER

Lance is barely afloat -- being swept past the pilings
through the pier by the rip tide -- a massive wall of white
water covers him -- finally he emerges again -- Mitch is
Maybe twenty yards away battering in the pilings -- Jack
has let the white water carry him and is almost even with
Mitch --

CLOSE SHOT JACK AND MITCH
They swim and claw their way towards Lance -- the river

carrying all of them Tons of white water thunder over
them but like corks they re-emerge -- closer

CLOSE SHOT - LANCE

He sees his friends and tries pulling himself with his
arms against the current he is obviously injured His
efforts succeed Jack draws closer -- closer -- Mitch
behind Finally he reaches out - Jack grabs his hand --
They are swept along that way -- iitch following

JACK
Hold on to him

Another wall of white water -- they come up still holding
on -- Mitch is close now --

JACK
(continuing)
Can you swim

LANCE
My legs dont work

Another massive churning of a secondary wave -- they
separate

CLOSE SHOT - LANCE
He looks at Jack

LANCE
Jack Lets just drown

CLOSE SHOT - JACK
He reaches out -- grabs him by the hair

JACK
Fuck you

Mitch has him now too -- expert lifeguard training and
years in the water pay off -- they tumble in the white

water -- Mitch pulls Jack -- Jack has hold of Lance who
is sputtering and gasping

DISSOLVE TO
THE BEACH

The three friends like we first saw them -- holding up
Lance in the middle -- he can barely walk on one leg --
the other is bloody and blue -- twisted He is cut in
several places as is Mitch -- they all look tired and
strangely old They are for the first time no longer young

-

They waik alone under the pier -- The lifeguard trucks --
the crowds -- are all up ahead -- on the point where the
action still goes on Great Sets are pouring through ana
riders like Gerry Lopez are viding them Lances ride

his perfect wave his moment in the green room has already
passed into the realm of tmayth and is just so much foam on
the shore

DISSOLVE TO
CLOSE SHOT KIDS

Kids -- punks -- gremmies -- a timeless expression of youth --
the hair longer --- the board smaller -- the jacket down-fillea
instead of a surplus trenchcoat but unchanged The
expression on their faces is the same - a sense of awe and
promise -- wanting something they cant yet have These
moments are burned into their minds forever are part of

an eternal youth an unspoiled and innocent time Lances
ride Lopez’ ride -- like the men themselves will grow old
and fade with the mist of legend just like the great swell
itself But these kids and their timeless expression

will always be here -- always be the same

CLOSE SHOT XID

One of these kids -- a classic gremmie like Denny or Flea
years ago walks up the beach to the three friends - under
his arm is Bears board -- the great sleek wooden Spear
that survived two Big Wednesdays His friends follow
behind timid and awed as he approaches Lance They look
over

KID
You Lance Johnson

Lance looks over

KID
(continuing)
I think this is your board man

Lance doesnt know what to say -- just looks at him

KID
(continuing)
That was the hottest ride Ive
ever seen in my life -- I -- 1
just wanted to say that

He starts to hand it to them -- Lance just ‘leans on his
friends - his broken leg throbs -- he blinks

LANCE
You keep it --
The Kid stops
LANCE

(continuing)
Youd like it wouldnt you

The Kid is speechless -- he just nods

LANCE
(continuing)
You keep it -- its yours now --
someday maybe if the waves get
big again -- youll ride it

He smiles at the Kid who just stands there in shock They
move on The Kid beams - his friends gather around him --
they stare at the board

260 THE PIT - THE THREE FRIENDS
Slowly painfully they climb the pit towards the gate --
kids gather around

KID
Hey man what happened to him

OTHER KID
Did he break his leg -- looks like
its broken --

ANOTHER
He broke his leg

STILL ANOTHER
Asshole -- thats Lance Johnson

They all mumble and stare

KID

A LIFEGUARD runs over

LIFEGUARD

He turns

LIFEGUARD CAPTAIN

JACK
I guarded here - I know how to
take care of him --- Well take care
of him

The Lifequard doesnt know what to say -- hes younger than
they are The Captain goes on -- therell be other things
on a day like this

They continue on -- the Lifeguard truck roars by -- SIREN
GOING Everybody loses interest -- a huge set is coming
in They approach the gate -- a few surfers and tourists
stand there

Lance holds up his hand and they stop Mitch and Jack let
him go and everybody watches as Lance hobbles through the

gate alone
CLOSE - YOUNG SURFERS

In their eyes there is a look of admiration as they watch
Lance walk through the gate Lances ride his perfect
wave his moment in the green room has already become a

legend
JACK AND MITCH

They follow Lance through the gate carrying their boards
Lance turns sharply and looks out to sea

GATE

Jack and Mitch aid Lance again and the three friends start
to walk away --- down the new sidewalk next to the cars

We SEE only their backs and their voices become dimmer as
they get further away

LANCE

They part -- each one going his Separate way -- Mitch to
his car where the little dark-haired Girl waits -- Jack to
his Forestry truck -- and Lance on down the highway

CLOSE SHOT LANCE

He drives along looking out at the waves between the houses
and he sees them as he always wanted

FULL SHOT - WAVES

Breaking full from a thousand points untouched by man
or board haughty arrogant superb
