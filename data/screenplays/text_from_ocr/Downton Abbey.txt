MONTAGE UNDER CREDITS

In a gilded room a crested letter is signed and placed inside
a leather satchel to be carried away by a liveried official
At King’s Cross Station silhouetted men load the mail bags
on to the night train Further down a man we will later know
as Major Chetwode walks through the steam to climb aboard
Out of a burst of more steam the train thunders through the
darkness Chetwode finds his compartment Inside a dimly lit
carriage postal workers sort the post into pigeon holes A
man pauses as he finds our letter The train continues
through the countryside as day breaks At dawn we follow a
royal mail van winding its way through a waking Downton
village until it stops by the post office The letter lands
on the counter where it attracts attention A postman on a
GPO motorcycle takes us to our first view of the iconic
house bathed in the morning light When Andy opens the back
door the postman holds up one envelope in particular

ANDY
Morning

POSTMAN
Special one today

ANDY
Blimey

He takes it with the rest of the post and starts down the
kitchen passage He is unusually dignified in his manner

MRS PATMORE
What have you got there

ANDY
Wouldnt you like to know

He sweeps on leaving Mrs Patmore and Daisy to register his
air of importance Andy gives the letters to Thomas who
raises his brows picks up a salver and starts up the stairs

MERTON
And now you were going to tell us
about Lady Bagshaw Is she a very
distant cousin

No Her father was my great-uncle

MARY
Then why have I never heard of her

VIOLET
Because she chose to cut herself
off from the family

MARY
Do you know the reason

VIOLET
Maybe I believe she means to cheat
your father of his rightful
inheritance She has no children
Your father is her nearest
relation

ROBERT
I wont have her put on the spot

Youre plotting something I see a
Machiavellian look in your eye

charming

Mr Barrow dont you think you
should speak to His Lordship

THOMAS
About what

BATES
Well its not right surely for
us to be humiliated in this way

THOMAS
What could he do about it

He walks off

ANNA
Is the staff always ridden over
roughshod whenever Royalty come to
stay Why do they bring so many
servants with them

BATES
Maybe its because they go from
house to house around the county
and they need to know things are
done the way they like

ANNA
As if we couldnt manage that

DAISY
Were not footballs Mr Bates and
we dont deserve a kicking

his presence

Goodness I thought everyone was in
the drawing room

She looks at him and wipes her eyes briskly

BRANSON
Ive been dodging it Im afraid I
suppose I ought to get back Can I
get someone for you

PRINCESS MARY
No Thank you Youre the widower
of the youngest daughter arent
you Ive heard of you Mr

BRANSON
Branson Tom Branson And who are
you I should know but Im no good
at that sort of thing

After a puzzled moment this pleases her

PRINCESS MARY
I suppose you cant be expected to
know everyone Did you enjoy the
parade

BRANSON
Im afraid I missed it completely
I got distracted
PRINCESS MARY
What a shame

BRANSON
Well to be honest Im not much of
a Royalist Although I probably
shouldnt say that out loud

PRINCESS MARY
Certainly not to a stranger That
seems odd as the Crawleys would die
for the Crown if they had to

BRANSON
You can love people you disagree
with

PRINCESS MARY
And you love them

BRANSON
Theyre decent at the core

PRINCESS MARY
People can be decent at the core
but very difficult to live with

BRANSON
True enough Theyre silly too and
snobbish at times And I wouldnt
give tuppence for their politics
But Ive learned to be happy with
all of that And besides theyre
my daughters family

She looks over to where the children are playing

PRINCESS MARY
And she lives here

BRANSON
I nearly took her away once She
belongs here now I spent so much
of my life not belonging anywhere
Thats important to me

PRINCESS MARY
I suppose in the end its
deciding whats important isnt
it Youve given me a great deal to
think about Mr Branson

BRANSON
Good things I hope

PRINCESS MARY
That may be so but now we must go
in

They get up

slowly backs out of the room

CORA
That was kind of you maam

years I wish to show my gratitude

She is very determined but Violet has boiled over

mother

MAUD
She does For years I said I was
her godmother but I told her the
truth on her eighteenth birthday

ISOBEL
How old was she when Jack died

MAUD
Six Shed lived with Jack and his
mother until then But I took her
into the house and she went to the
village school until eventually
she became my maid

ISOBEL
I suppose if shed been your ward
people would have guessed

MAUD
Exactly Who takes notice of a
servant I hid her in plain sight

ISOBEL
Did you love Jack Smith

MAUD
Everyone should know a total love
at least once Jack was mine My
husband was very dull you know He
wasnt a bad man but he wasnt a
clever one either And then he
died and Jack came to see me and it
began from there

They sit near the fire

ISOBEL
How daring

MAUD
I know it sounds reckless but I
was thirty-nine when I got
pregnant I thought I was barren
Of course I knew I couldnt tell
my father so I went to America

ISOBEL
They must have thought that wild

MAUD
Little did they know how wild it
really was

ISOBEL
But you were happy with Jack

MAUD
Very We had ten years together
before he died Id have married
him if Id had the courage I was
weak But you never knew my father

ISOBEL
I suppose Royal service kept you
silent on the subject

MAUD
In a way But it was cowardice
really Now by making Lucy my
heir I will have taken the first
step

ISOBEL
You must tell Violet at once

MAUD
I couldn’t

ISOBEL
Youre wrong As soon as she knows
the truth shell fathom your plans
and cease to fight you

estate and live a normal life

MARY
I want everything to stop being
such a struggle Will the staff
stay Will the farms pay What are
