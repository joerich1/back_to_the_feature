THE HAPPY PRINCE

by

Rupert Everett
INT NURSERY LONDON 1890 1
An extravagantly dressed MAN reads to TWO BOYS in a bed

MAN
‘Dear little swallow’ said the
Prince You tell me of marvellous
things but more marvellous than
this is the suffering of men and
women There is no mystery so
great as suffering Fly over my
city little swallow and tell me
what you see there’

EXT PARIS 1900 NIGHT 2

Heavy rain Blurred dreamlike images appear through it A
group laughing round a table Feet dashing across wet
cobbles A drenched Child begging by a Morris Column The
black silhouette of a carriage and horses splashing past him
A street materialises - seen through a sheet of rain pouring
down the awning of a cafe People are huddled comfortably
inside watching the down pour

MAN VO
So the swallow flew over the great
city and saw the rich making merry
in their beautiful houses while in
the dark lanes the white faces of
starving children looked out
listlessly at the black streets
At a table sat a broken man an
empty tumbler by his side with a
bunch of withered violets He was a
writer but he was too cold to
finish his play

EXT CAFE DE LA PAIX BOULEVARD ST GERMAIN NIGHT 3
A blotchy elephantine vagrant sits alone in a ring of empty
tables staring into his glass He wears a frayed coat and
has thin long badly dyed hair He looks up Straight at us
Dead watery eyes It is OSCAR WILDE

OSCAR
It’s a dream

He drains the glass rummages for money rises with
difficulty and shambles off down the crowded street
EXT BOULEVARD ST GERMAIN PARIS NIGHT 4

The CITY OF LIGHT in all its glory Cafes overflow onto the
street

31116
Men and women in evening dress take the air the ‘monde’
and the ‘demi monde’ urchins selling violets the whole
melting pot are out on this wet October night under the gas
light the plane trees and the swirling Van Gogh stars

The rain stops OSCAR weaves through the crowds with his
head down

A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN flanked by TWO MEN in SHINY TOP HATS
comes onto the street from a restaurant They are talking
loudly in English

Collision The WOMAN and OSCAR briefly lock eyes but he
moves quickly on

The TRIO continue arm in arm The two MEN chat amiably as
the WOMAN looks puzzled Suddenly she stops

TOP HAT ONE
What is it my dear

WOMAN
I think I left my fan

Before TOP HAT can object she has turned around just in
time to see OSCAR disappear in the crowd

She follows swimming against the pedestrian tide She’s
lost him

EXT SIDE STREET PARIS NIGHT

In sharp contrast to the brightly lit Boulevard this narrow
alley is dark and empty OSCAR is a lumbering silhouette at
the far end

The WOMAN appears at the corner

WOMAN
Mr Wilde

OSCAR stops

With her heart in her mouth the WOMAN moves into the
shadows He turns

WILDE
Madam

WOMAN
Surely you remember me I am Mrs
Arbuthnott I came to all your
first nights

FLASHBACK INT LONDON THEATRE NIGHT 1893

MRS ARBUTHNOTT applauds enthusiastically She is laughing

EXT SIDE STREET PARIS NIGHT

OSCAR
Of course Madam One never
forgets such a face How kind of
you to speak to me You are well
I see

MRS ARBUTHNOTT
(moved)
I am well sir but how are you

The TWO MEN appear at the end of the alley

MAN
Lydia Come here immediately

MRS ARBUTHNOTT
I shall have to go

OSCAR
You couldn’t lend me five pounds
could you Things are a little
tight at present I feel ghastly
asking like this but

MRS ARBUTHNOTT rummages in her purse Thrusts all her money
into his hand She is crying

MAN
Lydia

MRS ARBUTHNOTT
I’m coming Goodbye Mr Wilde I
wish

OSCAR
Never wish Madam It might come
true But adieu and thank you
for a moments harmony in a
discordant fugue

She turns and goes back to the TWO MEN
MAN

Never speak to my wife again or I
shall kill you do you hear

EXTINT HOTEL D’ALSACE PARIS NIGHT 9

OSCAR enters the hotel d’Alsace He climbs the stairs of
this dark and dingy HOTEL

Sounds of a squabble as a door opens and shuts

He drags himself up by the banister He stops to catch his
breath He holds his ear as if there is a deafening noise

M DUPOIRIER the HOTEL manager is coming down the stairs
with a TRAY

DUPOIRIER
(in french)
Any news of your bank draft
today M Melmoth

OSCAR
(also in French)
Alas no M Dupoirier but fear
not M Ross is arriving tomorrow
with royalties contracts and cash

DUPOIRIER
Excellent news Monsieur

INT HOTEL D’ALSACE BEDROOM NIGHT 10

Lit by a flickering gas jet OSCAR’S room is small with a
linoleum floor and dark wallpaper featuring tightly packed
flowers and leaves A small window looks out onto a
courtyard

OSCAR regards himself in a MIRROR His ear is bleeding He
touches it carefully with a finger then smears the mirror
with blood
OSCAR
See See where Christ’s blood
streams through the firmament

His reflection shimmers and the room suddenly lurches
behind him

OSCAR blinks and clutches the table

OSCAR (CONTD)
What is happening to me

31116

The strange spasm passes and he applies rouge and

foundation Greases his hair with an evil looking tincture

sprays some perfume in his mouth and leaves

INT BAR CALISAYA NIGHT

A YOUNG MAN and a BOY sit at a back table - JEAN a
handsome twenty year old who sells violets and his
consumptive brother LEON a matchstick boy Although they
are rough LEON is weeping JEAN sees OSCAR and gestures

OSCAR
(french)
What is the matter with our
little sparkler Dear Leon weep
no more I beg

JEAN
The sisters from the Orphanage
came for him and all his matches
got nicked

LEON
(bursting into fresh
tears)
Don’t let them take me back there
Jo Ill be more careful I
promise

JEAN
All I’m saying is it could be
better for everyone You’ll be
safe and I wont always be
worrying It’s getting too
fucking dangerous around here

LEON
But we’re brothers We should be
together

LEON puts his head in his hands and cries JEAN sighs and
looks at OSCAR for help

OSCAR
Well this is too frightful But
I too have news A sudden
windfall enables me to offer you
both at least absinthe and
cocaine on the eve of departure
and a purple moment for me if
Leon you will lend me your
relation for the usual
consideration

31116

He produces a coin LEON looks up Takes the coin

LEON
(sniffing)
Well twenty minutes And you
have to finish that story

INT SQUALID HOTEL BEDROOM NIGHT

OSCAR lies on a filthy bed in a squalid room Noises of
bonking and bedsprings through the ceiling JEAN a lithe
panther with his trousers down sprinkles powder into
cotton wool balls puts one in the side of his mouth and

gives another to OSCAR

OSCAR
You know I don’t think I’ve ever
been happier in my life In this
room At this moment The light
from the street

JEAN
What light

OSCAR
It carves you in marble dear
boy We are lost in our own
world Shrouded in a symphony of
adjacent copulation It’s really
quite good

He counts out notes on the bed JEAN looks at him with

obvious affection

OSCAR (CONT’D)
I know you love me Johnny even
though our purple hours are
sullied by green notes But what
can one do

OSCAR lurches from the bed doing up his flies tucking in

his shirt to the door He opens it LEON falls in

LEON
(unapologetic)
That was nearly an hour Story
time

OSCAR
Where was I

LEON
Under the bridge

OSCAR
Oh yes Under the bridge

31116

They all pile onto the bed LEON coughs

OSCAR (CONT’D)
Under the bridge two little boys
were lying in one another’s arms
to try and keep themselves warm
How hungry we are they said You
must not lie here shouted the
watchman and they wandered out
into the rain

EXT PARIS STREET NIGHT 14
The incongruous TRIO walk down a rainy street

him transfixed

LEON and JEAN giggle helplessly
MAURICE salutes and OSCAR pulls him on to his knee
A MAN with a TART watches them in disgust

MAN
Revolting pig Returning to your
vomit

MAURICE grabs the man by his lapel still sitting on
OSCARS knee The TART shrieks

MAURICE
You insult my friend Monsieur
Apologize now or I will kill you

MAN
Get your hands off me filth

MAURICE leaps up sending the table flying Glasses smash
Wine is spilt THE TART screams again

OSCAR
(oblivious)
How could I resist Look The
profile of Napoleon

fall to the floor

disappointing features

and livid

THE BAND plays an introduction

OSCAR
The boy I love is up in the
gallery
The boy I love is looking down at

As merry as a cricket that sings
on the lee

THE CROWD enjoy the show and sing along with the chorus to
the delight of OSCAR and his friends

Tremendous applause as the song ends

OSCAR is bleeding from the ear His eyes bulge and he is
sweating Hair dye and powder trickle down his ecstatic
face He swoops down into an elaborate bow and crashes

unconscious to the floor

A huge burst of applause

MRS ARBUTHNOTT sits between the TWO MEN laughing
OSCAR looks like a toad in the footlights and throws a huge
shadow against the red velvet curtain behind him He has a
metallic blue carnation in his buttonhole and a gold tipped
cigarette smoking in his hand
OSCAR (CONTD)

I congratulate you on the success

of your performance
Hysterical laughter

which persuades me that you think

almost as highly of the play as I

do myself

OSCAR waits for the next laugh but there is none only an
uncomfortable silence with a few coughs

CONSTANCE covers her face with her hands

Oscar Wilde the crime of which

you have been convicted is so
bad

OSCAR watches horrified

THE MARQUIS OF QUEENSBURY stares at him intently from the
front row of the court

JUDGE VO
that one has to put a stern
restraint upon oneself from
describing the sentiments which
must rise to the breast of every
man of honour who has heard the
details of these two terrible
trials

ROBBIE ROSS bows deeply as OSCAR is hustled through the
crowd

PROSTITUTES dance on the street
NEWS VENDORS shout

JUDGE VO (CONTD)
It is no use to address you

THE MARQUESS OF QUEENSBURY is mobbed on the steps of the
court

JUDGE VO (CONTD)
People who can do these things must
be dead to all sense of shame
I shall under such circumstances be
expected to pass the severest
sentence that the law allows

FLASHBACK INT PRISON CELL READING 21

To the sound of mayhem in court OSCAR in prison uniform
is thrown into a cell As the door slams and locks the roar
cuts out

An eye looks through a tiny spy hole in the door

Through the hole OSCAR sits on a board in the small brick
room with his head in his hands

M DUPOIRIER VO
Monsieur Melmoth Monsieur

It was a dream His ear is bandaged M DUPOIRIER is
standing over him DR TUCKER from the British Embassy
prepares an injection

From OSCARS point of view M DUPOIRIER flares and
sparkles The wallpaper pulses with OSCAR’S heartbeat

ROBBIE ROSS leans over the bed He wears a travelling coat
OSCAR is hallucinating

OSCAR
(weakly)
Robbie My lonely rider of the
apocalypse You took me into
exile dear boy Where will you
take me now What ship Ireland
you say

ROBBIE sits on the edge of the bed and takes OSCAR’S hand

ROBBIE
No ships Oscar I am here in
Paris I have your allowance

OSCAR
Ah good Good I have been
dinnerless

OSCAR stares at the wall The flowers shimmer and jump He
groans

OSCAR (CONTD)
I am in mortal combat with this
wallpaper Robbie One of us has
to go

31116

ROBBIE
Maurice says you made quite a
scene last night

OSCAR
It is more or less impossible to
make good scenes in such reduced
circumstances as mine but I
believe I did my best Last night
I dreamt I was supping with the
dead

ROBBIE
You must have been the life and
soul of the party Oscar

DR TUCKER rolls up OSCAR’S sleeve

OSCAR
Morphia is mere seltzer to me
now but good Dr Tucker will
only give me ether or chloral on
holidays of obligation I am much
distracted dear boy I have had a
very bad time lately and for two
days not a penny in my pocket so
had to wander about filled with
wild longings trapped in the
circle of the boulevards one of
the worst in the inferno

The needle goes in OSCAR visibly relaxes

OSCAR (CONT’D)
I shall never forget your kindness
dear boy when I was released from
prison What high hopes we had that
day But I was doomed from the
start Why does one run towards
ruin Why does it hold such a
fascination

EXT HARBOUR OF DIEPPE DAWN MAY 1897

A green misty sky merges with the sea

ROBBIE ROSS stands on the quay looking out to sea

The noise of a horn bounces across the sleepy port and out
the mist the NEWHAVEN PACKET SHIP materializes Smoke from
the funnel curves across the sky

ROBBIE catches sight of the boat and runs down the jetty

On board the ship a lone OSCAR watches the harbour
approach

31116

When he sees his friend he throws back his head and laughs
The ship docks OSCAR lumbers down the gangplank
The men embrace warmly

ROBBIE

From what you say Oscar it
would seem that Reading Gaol is
an enchanted castle with the
Governor as its presiding elf

OSCAR
Robbie I met Christ in prison

REGGIE
What was she in for

OSCAR
Don’t joke Reggie In the cell
there is only God and Man After
three days in hell Jesus rose
from the dead Discarded his
cerements broke open the tomb
and took his place forever in the
heart of man After seven hundred
days of hard labour my tomb has
opened I have tiptoed to the
boat train and I am born again
Through him with him and in
France

ROBBIE
(laughing)
Very good Oscar We’ll make a
Catholic of you yet

REGGIE
Only unlike dear Jesus you have
luggage and eight hundred pounds
to spend before your ascension
into heaven

ROBBIE
Or purgatory I’m afraid a
delegation of fifteen young poets
is arriving from Paris at the
weekend to welcome you into exile
They are bringing a cheque

31116

OSCAR
Oh Good All I am saying dear
Reggie is that I lived in the
grip of vice and pleasure It was
wrong and I have paid Perhaps
the slate is wiped clean Perhaps
it is not We shall see At any
rate I am ready to return to
life

at the desk and tries to reassemble it

BOSIE

(screaming)
I hear from your so called
friends that you no longer wish
to see me Can it be that you
have forgotten all you said
before you went to prison
Nothing but my love sustained you
then your soul clung to my soul
Now you no longer wish to know
me God knows I have suffered too
during these two years There is
prison without prison but I will
tell you this Never for one
moment has the intensity of my
love for you faltered I feel as
I felt the day I met you I have
waited for this day for two
years I am now half crazed with
grief When this letter reaches
you I might be dead

That the delicate buds of French
art should find their way to this
desert outpost in order to
welcome and raise this bruised

wall his huge hands around the MANS throat

OSCAR

wagging his finger as he
catalogued my crimes to his growing

spits a huge gob which lands on OSCAR’S face The CROWD

ROBBIE
I read your letter from prison It
is really rather marvellous You
should call it De Profundis

OSCAR
Well it was written from the
depths

ROBBIE

Bosie will probably try to kill you
when he reads it

OSCAR
I wrote some harsh letters to you
Robbie I am sorry

ROBBIE
You wrote harsh letters to us
all We were trying our best

OSCAR
I know Its hard to describe the
feeling of utter impotence and
desperation in there One becomes
a fury One never speaks One
simply weeps and has diarrhea
Result lunacy Do you forgive
me

OSCAR takes ROBBIE’S hand

ROBBIE
Who would have thought that
afternoon we met fifteen years
ago that here we’d be Lepers
dining under a full moon ina

romantic in a way

OSCAR

Except that you dear boy are
not a leper Tomorrow you will
blow away on the sea breeze -
destination Dover - like a
dandelion seed As to who would
have thought We met in a public
lavatory Bobbie dear and we
ended up here You wouldn’t have
to be the Sybil of Mortimer

and continues to read his paper

Inside the cubicle a trembling OSCAR fills the whole space
ROBBIE is squashed against the toilet Neither one can undo
their trousers From a hole in the wooden partition a
tongue waggles OSCAR suppresses a little shriek

ROBBIE smiles and puts his finger to his lips as he tries
to undo OSCARS flies

A minute later he comes out in a bathing costume and
marches into the sea finally crashing in like a porpoise
He swims back and forth without his hair getting wet
Waves splash in his face

He did not wear his scarlet coat
For blood and wine are red
And blood and wine were on his

OSCAR
Since you left I have been
completely alone

ROBBIE
Oscar that’s simply not true

OSCAR
My wife has written me a
revolting letter in which she
tells me that PERHAPS she will
see me at some later date but
not in the foreseeable future
and the boys probably never

ROBBIE

But Oscar I am amazed that you
should imagine that Constance
would want to see you at all You
write her one letter full of your
usual perfumed shit and you
suppose that everything you’ve
put her through for the last few
years can simply be forgotten

OSCAR
Robbie if you have come here to
upset me I suggest you return to
Dieppe immediately where you will
find a train that leaves at three
minutes past the hour Every
hour

ROBBIE
I am not here to upset you Oscar
I just want you to be reasonable

OSCAR

Bosie whom you all deplore at
least offers to help me

31116

ROBBIE
Oh really How Oscar How is
Bosie going to help you

OSCAR
Bosie loves me Robbie In a way
that you could never understand
In any case he’s is coming here
next week

ROBBIE
Then you will never see Constance
again You seem to forget that
despite everything you have put
her through she still allows you
four pounds a week That four
pounds Oscar is dependant upon
Bosie’s absence from your life
But doubtless he will settle some
money upon you when he gets here
If his mother has given him any

OSCAR
(screaming)
I am all alone I don’t have
anyone Why are you being so
harsh

ROBBIE
You have me Oscar I am here

No reaction

ROBBIE (CONTD)
But it’s not enough is it Why
is it not enough Oscar

OSCAR
Well frankly my dear you’re not
really grand enough and you’re
certainly not rough enough Lets
get a drink for Gods sake

OSCAR takes ROBBIE’S arm and they walk back towards the
HOTEL in the distance

OSCAR (CONTD)
Don’t be cross Bobbie You weren’t

get to it and just as many to get
back The Priest who is charming
has become a great friend
Yesterday he showed me all his
vestments He looked particularly
captivating in his martyrs garb -
rose doree streaked with blood

OSCAR goes in and sits alone in the chapel

AN OLD BENT PRIEST comes in and shuffles towards the alter
drops with difficulty to his knees grasps the foot of a
particularly gruesome crucifix and kisses the feet of Jesus

gazes at OSCAR with great compassion

Dear Bosie After long and
fruitless waiting I have
determined to write to you

gave me pain

OSCAR
Our ill fated and most lamentable
friendship has ended in ruin and
public infamy for me yet the
memory of our ancient affection
is often with me and the thought
that loathing bitterness and
contempt should forever take that
place in my heart once held by
love is very sad to me

I will come straight to the

with your friend in Naples I’m
reliably informed that you may be
able to help me I must rescue
Lord Alfred from the clutches of
Mr Wilde

ROBBIE
Or Mr Wilde from the influence of
your son Lady Queensbury I was
under the impression that you and
Mr Wilde were friends

LADY QUEENSBURY
Indeed Hardly I was revolted by
him on sight An oily indolent
toad dazzled by society I said
nothing of course - a mother
knows when to keep quiet -
although my flesh crawled when he
entered a room The connection
with my son made him giddy
Drunk Lord Alfred was only
twenty

ROBBIE
Are you familiar with the
circumstances of their early
friendship The reason Lord
Alfred approached Mr Wilde in the
first place

LADY QUEENSBURY
Not exactly no

31116

ROBBIE
Then I shall tell you Your son was
being blackmailed by a young man at
Oxford Bosie asked Mr Wilde to
help him Oscar did A Lawyer was
found Money was paid - by Wilde -
never repaid The problem was
resolved and put on a ship bound
for Australia Later on it was
your son who introduced Oscar to
the alleys and lanes of
Whitechapel and the nighttime
markets of living flesh Just as it
was your son who was guilty of all
but one of the crimes for which Mr
Wilde was later convicted
Nevertheless Lady Queensbury we
should stand united Together we
may be able to separate them

How could I They would say that
I’d abandoned you Again Robbie
Reggie the whole Greek chorus

OSCAR
Well maybe I could help you out
I was thinking of going to the
beach this afternoon but on
reflection perhaps it would be
more convenient if I simply
adjourned to some overflowing
Neapolitan latrine and blew my
brains out

31116

BOSIE
Possible

OSCAR
You would learn of the tragedy at

With money

OSCAR (CONTD)
Well

BOSIE
My mother has stopped my
allowance

OSCAR
What When did this happen Oh
Christ

BOSIE
I was waiting for the right
moment to tell you

OSCAR
But in the mean time you imagined
that wretched boy would fuck you
for fun

BOSIE
And why not

OSCAR
Your vanity is extraordinary The
only person who ever fucked you
for fun was me And look where it
got me The dock So that’s it
then We appear to have come to
the end of the road We’re
penniless

BOSIE
Well not exactly

OSCAR
Oh

BOSIE
You could have two hundred pounds
and I could keep my allowance

OSCAR
If

BOSIE

Well what Mama and the family
really can’t stomach is the fact
that we live together She says
that if we agree to separate she
will reinstate my allowance and
very generously I think give
you this substantial

OSCAR
Tip For services rendered To
the Family Would I get a good
reference Can I keep my cottage
(MORE )

31116

OSCAR (CONTD)

God you all make me sick Your
sanctimonious mother thinks that
I can be brought off for two
hundred pounds Your family has
destroyed me stripped me of
everything not least my genius
And all for two hundred pounds

BOSIE
Genius You destroyed yourself
Oscar because underneath the
pose there was NO SUBSTANCE One
good comedy three pot boiling
melodramas and those ridiculous
fairy stories That’s all you
find if you scrape away the
powder and the pancake Your
success was interesting Your
hunger for it perversely
fascinating But you my dear
never were

OSCAR
You found me interesting enough
when you were faced with
blackmail

BOSIE
You were in your element You saw
the green baize door swing open
and you scuttled through it

OSCAR
You are talking drivel My
father

BOSIE
Was a drunken groper with dirty
fingernails just like his son

OSCAR
Whereas YOUR father is an
assassin at large

BOSIE
Oh come on Oscar you’re still
alive

OSCAR
Barely

OSCAR collapses to a chair gasping for breath and clutching
his heart

BOSIE
For Gods sake stop acting

OSCAR looks up at BOSIE

It’s strange I’ve never really
looked at you before I gave you
my whole life and now I see it
before me daubed in shit

may as well stay here until the
lease runs out Then I shall
probably go to Paris Who knows
At any rate we’ll be in touch
Dear boy do you mind awfully if
I don’t wait I’m not really made
for waving pocket handkerchiefs

at a table and nurses the remains of a drink

Later he is talking to an ENGLISH VICAR and HIS FRIEND

holding forth as the bill arrives OSCAR beams as they pay
and leave

Later he is alone looking at the rain WAITERS watch him
from inside the bar

31116

Suddenly the awning in front of the bar is cranked back A
huge deluge of water falls on OSCAR The WAITERS laugh
A very drunk OSCAR sits in the pouring rain His hat is
drenched People stare as they go past and he waves
pathetically
ROBBIE ROSS walks by OSCAR sees him

OSCAR

Months of punitive silence
Naples was as you so accurately
predicted a disaster

ROBBIE smiles despite himself

OSCAR (CONT’D)
It seems as though I am always
asking for it but do I have your
forgiveness

ROBBIE
Forgiveness is for amateurs and
you dear Oscar are a
professional masochist Come on
I’1l take you home

OSCAR
Oh dear boy so cruel

ROBBIE
Anyway to be pardoned would mean
nothing to you You always want
to serve the full sentence Can
you forgive yourself

OSCAR
Oh Robbie what an
uncompromising curtain raiser
The ruined woman hardly knows how
to react Should I leave the
room or should I fall again into
your arms Of course Bobbie you
silly little thing I shall never
forgive myself for being born

118 EXT STREETS AND HOTEL D’ALSACE NIGHT

OSCAR and ROBBIE walk back to the Hotel ROBBIE has to
support OSCAR who stumbles and weaves

OSCAR
To think that I have wasted so
much time sacrificed everything
for a person who was quite simply
not my style However Now I have
a young panther who quite twists
my lips with kisses

ROBBIE
Spare me the details

31116

OSCAR
With a little brother of thirteen
who enjoys my stories They live
together at Clignacourt The
little one has the consumption
and sells matches You shall meet
them They are quite charming

ROBBIE
Indeed But the poets The
artists Your old friends What
of them

OSCAR
Lost in the mist dear boy
I am a vampire I lurk in the
noon shadows blanched by
sunlight but at dusk I bloom a
deadly nightshade that kills with
a kiss Sometimes they see me
The old friends Leaving a cafe
Under a lamp Getting off the
omnibus and I see them their
faces twisted with terror and
disgust as though the gates of
hell suddenly gaped before them
It’s really quite amusing

ROBBIE
But you have not lost everything
Oscar Reading Gaol is the most
successful poem ever written

OSCAR
Most successful Most brilliant
Most promising Most ambitious
Most cruel Most sorrowful Most
dangerous Most disgusting
Words Words Words are
irrelevant Do you think I’m
going mad

ROBBIE
No Oscar but I don’t believe a
‘word’ you say

OSCAR
No I am going mad I shall never
write again Bobbie I don’t need
to A life of squalor has been
revealed to me I embrace it

ROBBIE
Oscar You do not live in
squalor There is light and
water

31116

OSCAR
And linoleum and indescribable
wallpaper But let us not
squabble like two disgruntled
housemaids Let us rather black
our grates with a light heart and
chatter about our betters Bosie
we hear has come into twenty
thousand pounds He arrives next
week I thought I might touch him
for a tiny pour boire when I dine
with him What do you say

ROBBIE
Well he has brought a stud
outside Paris

OSCAR
Typical He knows absolutely
nothing about horses and yet he
always manages to back the loser
(suddenly coy)
Will you come up Robbie

ROBBIE
No Oscar Lets forget all that

Pause

OSCAR

THE TWO MEN look at each other Finally
ROBBIE
I think you hurt yourself more

had mysterious skin ever since

BOSIE
Oh leprosy I expect

OSCAR
Thank you my dear But let us
talk of more cheerful things

part In and out of
consciousness

OSCAR
As in life

BOSIE
My brother Percy went to see him
just before the end Father
opened his eyes and spat at him

ROBBIE
Queensbury rules until the end

OSCAR
Well I at least have outlived
my nemesis although I am more or
less starving at the moment

BOSIE
Shovelling down Lobster Newberg

OSCAR
A magnificent treat And at the
moment sadly all too rare Bosie
dear this brings me rather
neatly to an awkward point

BOSIE
Oscar Do not ask me for money I
have absolutely none to spare

31116

OSCAR
But dear boy you have just
inherited twenty thousand pounds
have you not Surely you do not
wish to see me on the street

BOSIE
As you are behaving like an old
prostitute Oscar perhaps the
street is where you belong

OSCAR shrugs his shoulders and keeps eating

ROBBIE
For Gods sake Bosie

BOSIE
This has nothing to do with you
Robbie Keep out of it Garcon

ROBBIE
Unfortunately it has Since Oscar
threw in his lot with you at
Naples he been cut adrift by
everyone Constance has died His
sons have been taken away from
him His so called friends have
deserted him And now you who
owe him everything turn your
back

BOSIE

(screaming)
I am sick and tired of being
blamed for the self inflicted
wounds of a gluttonous snob I am
not my lovers keeper If he wants
to eat he should work Oscar what
have you written recently

A WAITER wheels a trolley towards the table

OSCAR
Ah The Pudding trolley

only a passing thought

BOSIE

BOSIE
Do you suppose I care I asked
you a question Oscar Does the
flame still burn No it doesn’t
does it So I am supposed to keep
you in luxury while you stumble
about the boulevard begging for
drinks Christ Some of us have
to work

lids

REGGIE

OSCAR

poisonous moule four months ago and
I’ve been in and out of bed ever
since Dear boy behind the commode

champagne Open it and lets drink

OSCAR
Of course we shouldn’t You have
crossed the water for a treasured
friend There are glasses under the
bed

REGGIE opens the champagne OSCAR clutches at his stomach and
groans as he tries to sit up

REGGIE
Poor darling But I hear you are

OSCAR
(uneasy)

some divine note books in which to
scribble beautiful thoughts but

OSCAR (CONTD)
I will tell you a terrible secret -
don’t tell Robbie please Reggie
there’s a dear

REGGIE pours champagne OSCAR leans towards him and whispers

OSCAR (CONTD)
I have sold the play to three
different individuals and I
havent written a single word
Rather clever don’t you think
There is nothing like an Irish
beggar once he gets into his
stride

REGGIE
But what will you do when the time
comes to deliver it

OSCAR
Die I am paralysed by dark
thoughts Sometimes I wonder Is it
a moule It could be something
else Oh God

REGGIE

OSCAR is overwhelmed and puts his hand on his ear

OSCAR
Why did Constance die Why have I
become so mad Reggie my brain has
crashed and shattered Is this

OSCAR is trembling REGGIE takes his hand

REGGIE
What Oscar

From OSCARS point of view the room is suddenly enormous
CONSTANCE appears in the distance She walks towards the bed
singing She is young and beautiful and regards OSCAR
lovingly

CONSTANCE

Syphilis

She disappears and the room contracts OSCAR is rigid with
fear REGGIE watches concerned

OSCAR
Do you see the hell in which I
live Robbie wants me to write a
play and I am wrestling with my
soul Reggie I cannot write a

play

OSCAR REGGIE and MAURICE drive through the park

leaves fall The sky is white and blustery

OSCAR
What does it profit a man to gain
the whole world and lose his own
soul

REGGIE
What Why do you ask

OSCAR
I was driving through the park one
Sunday years ago and close by
Marble Arch there stood a little
crowd of shabby looking people
listening to some vulgar street
preacher As I passed by I heard
the man yelling out that question
to his audience It struck me as
being rather dramatic A wet
Sunday an uncouth Christian in a
macintosh a ring of sickly white
faces under a broken roof of
dripping umbrellas anda
wonderful phrase flung into the air
by shrill hysterical lips It was
really very good in its way

The THREE MEN laugh OSCAR is proud of his memory

REGGIE
That’s marvellous Oscar Do you
remember everything you’ve written

OSCAR
Isn’t it extraordinary I can’t
think what happened last week
One’s whole life is a blur All
that remains clear black and
white carved in stone are the
words

secret of his success Come on

loudly followed by a fart More hilarity REGGIE and MAURICE
tidy up and flirt

There is a knock on the door

They each have a bunch of flowers

All well in the underworld

JEAN
We heard that you’re sick

LEON
Are you dying

JEAN
Shut up

LEON
Because if you are you have to

OSCAR
You see Reggie more creditors to
add to our list I am dying beyond
my means Dear boys you shall have
the story we shall have champagne
cocaine and perhaps one last
mauve moment for me

Everyone groans

OSCAR (CONTD)
It was a joke Now sit down
everyone and we’ll begin Where was
I

LEON
The two emeralds

OSCAR
The two emeralds Let me see
‘It is winter’ said the swallow
‘In Egypt the sun is warm My
companions are building a nest in
the Temple of Baalbec and pink and
white doves are watching them and
cooing softly to each other Dear
Prince I must leave you but I
will never forget you and next
spring I shall bring you back two
beautiful jewels in place of those
you have given away Turn down the
gaslight would you Reggie

In the light from the fire the group settles down REGGIE
sits on a small sofa next to MAURICE and the TWO BROTHERS at
the end of the bed

LEON begins to cough There is blood REGGIE horrified
covers his mouth with a handkerchief

OSCAR (CONTD)
‘In the square below’ said the
Happy Prince’ there stands a
little match boy His matches have
fallen in the gutter and they are
all spoiled His sisters will beat
him if he does not bring home some
money and he is crying He has no
shoes or stockings and his little
head is bare Pluck out my emerald
eyes and give them to him and his
sisters will not beat him

Everyone listens Eyes glitter in the firelight REGGIE’S
hand is stroking MAURICE’S leg

Later REGGIE is asleep his head on MAURICE’S shoulder The
others are nodding off Only LEON listens intently

31116

OSCAR (CONT’D)

Then the swallow came back to the
Prince ‘You are blind now’ he
said ‘ so I will stay with you
always‘ Then the snow came and
after the snow came the frost At
last the swallow knew that he was
going to die

A different bed and different people OSCAR’S TWO CHILDREN
listen enraptured as a younger OSCAR reads

OSCAR
He had just enough strength to fly
up to the Prince’s shoulder once
more ‘Goodbye dear Prince’ He
murmured ‘I am glad you are going
to Egypt little swallow’ Said the
Prince

131 INT HOTEL D’ALSACE BEDROOM NIGHT 1900 131
OSCAR gasps lost suddenly in memory
OSCAR
It is not to Egypt I am going It
is to the house of death Death is
the brother of sleep is he not’
And he kissed the Happy Prince on
the lips and fell down dead at his
feet
Silence OSCAR looks around

intently into his eyes ROBBIE looks around helplessly

INT CARRIAGE PARIS NIGHT 137

ROBBIE and a small Irish Priest FR DUNNE are jolting back
towards the Hotel d’Alsace

ROBBIE
I must tell you father the
dying man has been quite a well
known literary figure

FR DUNNE
It’s all one and the same thing
to Our Lord He has no time to
read Mr Ross with all of us
sinners clogging up the road to
hell But who might your friend
be who has come home so late and
yet so thirsty for the sacred
blood of Christ

A moments silence ROBBIE takes a deep breath

ROBBIE
Oscar Wilde

FR DUNNE’S eyeballs nearly pop out

FR DUNNE
Jesus Christ
(flustered)
Has Mr Wilde expressed a desire
for extreme unction

ROBBIE
Most certainly While he could
still speak

FR DUNNE
Has he been received Is he not a
protestant

ROBBIE
He was meant to be a Catholic

ROBBIE breaks down

31116
FR DUNNE
Oh my son don’t worry I’m sure
we can sort something out I have
everything we might need with me
unless of course exorcism is
called for

FR DUNNE laughs ROBBIE dries his eyes

FR DUNNE (CONTD)
Just my little joke I must say I
am quite excited I once sat in
the gallery of course through a
performance of The Ideal Husband
Now there’s a play although I
gather Mr Wilde was not much of
one himself Still God moves in
mysterious ways his wonders to
perform

receive you into the church and
give you absolution but you need

always time for an act of
contrition There’s no need to
hurry Good evening Mr Wilde I

That’s right Let us all kneel

ROBBIE DR TUCKER FR DUNNE and DUPOIRIER kneel by the

bed and cross themselves REGGIE uncertainly follows suit

OSCAR regards the faces around the bed and begins to panic

He is somewhere else
