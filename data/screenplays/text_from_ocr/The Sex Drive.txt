INT MASSIVE RAVE - NIGHT

Techno music thumps as we snake through a crowded party All
we see are people and lights Everyone is either dancing
talking or making out Arrive behind a petit brunette with a
body that has precipitated many a boner MS TASTY turns
revealing a sweet stunning twenty-year-old smile

MS TASTY
Ian Hey sweetie (Strikes a
sexy pose) So What do you think

Reverse to show who she’s posing for but IAN is silhouetted
backlit by disco lights He speaks with smug confidence

IAN
Not bad I’ve seen better but you
make it work

She’s not put off by the back-handed compliment On the
contrary it seems to make her try harder

MS TASTY
Jerk So when do I get to check
out your big sexy bod L-O-L

Her face rotates unnaturally ninety degrees on it’s side and
winks ) Pull back hard to reveal thousands maybe millions
of people at this party The heads become pixels on Ms
Tasty’s MySpace page on a computer in

INT IAN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The real Ian lies in bed with his laptop wearing a Darth
Vader t-shirt Chicago Cubs pajama bottoms and reading
glasses He’s eighteen but could pass for sixteen Hes a
sweet kid with the kind of thoughtful approachable face you
might seek when in need of directions

Close on her words on the screen “JERK SO WHEN DO I GET TO
CHECK OUT YOUR BIG SEXY BOD L-O-L”

Ian lets out a nervous giggle He types his reply “IT’S NOT
REALLY THAT SEXY” He stops and deletes that

IAN
(whispering to himself)
God Don’t be a dork Act cool
Be a dick Just be a dick
He retypes “DAMN UR SO PUSHY I’LL UPLOAD MY PIC IN A SEC”

Ian opens a picture of himself in PhotoShop He borrows some
facial hair from a photo of Brad Pitt and places it on his
own face He opens a folder called “Family Pics” then a
subfolder titled “REX” He opens a picture of a cocky tough
guy leaning against a shiny orange 1969 GTO Judge Ian
places his own head on the tough guy’s body

As he does this work we get a look at the room which is
divided by a line of electrical tape running down the wall
marked DYLANS SIDE - IAN KEEP OUT Ians side is neat
and sparsely decorated with a few band posters and some Lord
of the Rings merch The other side of the room is cluttered
and decorated with extreme sports and bikini girl posters
Several motocross and snowboarding trophies are proudly
displayed Ian’s brother DYLAN sleeps in a twin bed
His Tiger Beat face even looks confident while asleep A
clock reads 1221 am

END TITLES

Ian clicks “Upload Pic” and we return to the

“Got You Where I Want You” by the Flys as several lovely
female mall employees arrive and walk by in slow motion Ian
sneaks longing looks at each of them Several quick close up
shots of hair smiles exposed thongs and the impressions of
bras and hard nipples through tight shirts

Finally a cute detached girl about Ians age shows up

INT MALL FOOD COURT - DAY

A giant foam donut walks through the food court handing out
coupons Senor Donut wears a small sombrero black tights
and a purple cape Ian’s right arm sticks out of the suit
The left arm is fake as Ian’s real left arm is kept inside
the suit to operate the mouth (Like the Big Bird suit) He
tries to hand out coupons but he’s a soft timid sell

IAN
Hi Would you like a coupon for
six free-- No Okay cool Sorry

Ian turns to find Ron in his way arms folded

RON
Hmmm You don’t sound like Sefior

their way Ian turns to her and in a lame Mexican accent

be thinking about getting those

Tiff gestures to her own fake boobs then turns away to flip
through a rack of dresses Felicia mimes plunging a knife
into Tiff’s back over and over Tiff turns to look at
Felicia who stops killing her and smiles back innocently

TIFFANY (CONTD)

FELICIA

Felicia notices Sefor Donut out in the mall going up the

gang-banger-wannabes They push Ian and he falls sideways

him down

INT MALL

Felicia jogs from the shop holding her dress off the ground
As she arrives the kids are stomping Ian like a narc

swagger He’s a foot shorter than she

INT IAN’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

The basement is unfinished The old mismatched furniture
clashes with the shag carpet Rex’s weight bench and
punching bag are set up in one corner Ian sits down at a
desk dons his glasses and fires up an old yellowed
computer A sign taped to the monitor reads “Dad’s Computer
- No Surfing the World Wide Internets” A Windows 98 logo
comes up Ian sighs as the dial-up tones sputter and beep

INTERCUT - MYSPACE CYBER RAVE IAN’S BASEMENT

IAN
Yeah whatever I don’t know
Knoxville’s a long way

MS TASTY
I think I can make it worth the
drive

Back in reality Ian’s jaw drops He types the word “HOW”

He takes a deep breath before clicking “Send” Push in on
Ian’s expectant face as the reply comes in “MsTasty U DRIVE
ALL THE WAY HERE 4 ME AND I’11 GO ALL THE WAY WITH U” Ian

stares back at the screen wide-eyed

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

IAN
All the way She wants to go all
the way With me (HUGE GRIN) She
wants to go all the way with me

Cut to a vinyl record dropping on dad’s old turntable After
a moment of crackling cue “Da Ya Think I’m Sexy” by Rod
Stewart Ian dances in wild celebration performing moves
that are as sexually suggestive as they are awkward He
sings along He starts punching Rex’s punching bag then he
starts humping it as part of the dance He freezes when he
hears the need scrape off the record

Ian’s dad stands at the turntable Ian lamely tries to morph
the dance into acting casual He’s out of breath

IAN (CONTD)
Hey I was justexercising

IANS FATHER
Whatd I tell you about monkeying
with my 45s

Dad takes the record and moves on Ian drops his head A
moment later Dylan enters

DYLAN

IAN
So

DYLAN
You wanna smell my finger

Ian glares back annoyed After a beat

IAN
Yeah okay

Ian takes a whiff then winces
IAN (CONTD)
Ugh Are you sure you got the
right hole

Dylan looks slightly alarmed and confused He sniffs it

INT DRUG STORE - DAY
Close on the condom section - several shelves filled with all

manner of rubbers Ian nonchalantly breezes by reading the
boxes as he passes

Script provided for educational purposes More scripts can be found here httpwwwsellingyourscreenplaycomlibrary

Further down the aisle he puts a few items in his basket

He breezes by again tries to stop too uncomfortable keeps
moving A moment later he returns A cart is parked between
Ian and the condoms A soccer mom drifts down the aisle
away from the cart leaving her cute-as-a-button two-year-old
girl perched in the cart seat

LITTLE GIRL
Hi

Ian gives her a strained smile as he reaches over her for a
box He inadvertently triggers an electronic display A ten-
inch condom-man dances waves it’s arms and hollers

RUBBER-MAN
CONGRATULATIONS YOU CHOSE RAMSES
FOR MAXIMUM STIMULATION

Ian snaps his hand away knocking several boxes of condoms
into the cart The child’s mother turns to give Ian a
suspicious glance Ian musters a smile back Mom starts
back his way Ian grabs one box and bolts

When the mom returns her baby girl presents her with a box
of Magnums

LITTLE GIRL’S MOM
Yeah I wish

INT DRUG STORE - CASHIER LINE

Ian now has a pile of junk in his basket He gets into the
line of a frumpy middle-aged cashier Suddenly another
lane is opened by a beautiful bubbly woman

stands to see It’s Rick’s monster truck coming right for
him Lance hits the deck The truck rolls over him leaving
him untouched but running over one side of the headboard
When Lance stands the headboard comes apart and he’s able to
slip the remaining cuff off of the bar it had clung to

runs down the rows Extreme close up on a blade of corn
stalk as it slashes Lance’s arm like a paper cut Then
another cuts his face

She’s dressed English but she has the kind of natural make-
up-free beauty that would make most women want to punch her
in the head Lance is smitten Felicia takes discontented
notice of this Ian takes his own discontented notice of

song birds are gradually drowned out by A HIGH PITCHED BUZZ
Rex speeds down the street on a dirtbike As he nears his
house he locks up the brakes Before the bike stops he
coolly steps off letting it ghost ride for a few yards
before it lays down spinning and sparking to a stop

him to start kicking it He breaks it He reaches inside
and pulls out Ian’s bike and starts slamming it against the
driveway Once out of steam he stomps down the driveway and
across the street

As he crosses he holds up a “halt” hand Offscreen we hear
a car go into a shrieking skid Rex is unfazed as he marches
up Felicia’s driveway The car rolls by behind him

Rex arrives on Felicia’s porch He rings the bell and
seethes and swears under his breath while he waits
Felicia’s mother opens the door His face instantly
transitions to sweet and neighborly She smiles back

neighbor watering his yard next door
