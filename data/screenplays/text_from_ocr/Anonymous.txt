BLACK SCREEN
TITLES BEGIN over the SOUNDS of city traffic

FADE UP

EXT THEATER DISTRICT OF BROADWAY - DUSK

The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for
their shows Cabs line the streets

SIDE ALLEY

A cab quickly turns into the alley coming to a
screeching halt A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and
rushes to the side entrance of a theater

In the background we see that the title of the play
Anonymous is written on the theatres marquee
INT BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DUSK

We follow the Man in the Grey Suit as he rushes through
narrow backstage hallways passing several ACTORS
dressing in Elizabethan costumes applying their make-

up etc

TITLES CONTINUE

INT BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGEEMPTY STAGE - DUSK

The curtains are still closed and the sound of the
audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard

Stagehands are moving stage lights as--

A STAGE MANAGER
takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the
audience-- its a full house He holds a prop umbrella
in one hand anxiously checks his watch in the other

He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief
floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit
hurrying over to him The Stage Manager wordlessly
hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in
the background

The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the
audience dies down

pg 2

INT BROADWAY THEATER - THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

The man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage a
single light on him He is PROLOGUE (We will see
the same actor later as the Prologue of Henry V)

Prologue regards his audience for a beat before

PROLOGUE

Soul of the Age
The applause delight the wonder of
our stage
Our Shakespeare rise

(beat repeating)
Our Shakespeare For he is all of
ours is he not The most performed
playwright of all time The author of
37 plays 154 sonnets and several
epic poems that are collectively known
as the ultimate expressions of
humanity in the English language And
yet And yet
(beat)
Not a single manuscript of any kind
has ever been found written in
Shakespeares own hand In four
hundred years not one document-- be
it poem play diary or even a simple
letter
(beat)
He was born the son of a glove-maker
and at some unknown time armed with
but an elementary school education he
went to London where the story goes

he became an actor and eventually a
playwright

OFF STAGE

A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a
flat metal pate creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER

Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a
stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES

ON STAGE
Prologue opens his umbrella

PROLOGUE (CONTD)
He died at the age of 56 and was
survived by his wife and two daughters
who were like Shakespeares own
father irrefutably illiterate

pg 3
OFF STAGE
In the rafters a stagehand opens valves It starts to
RAIN

PROLOGUE (OC) (CONTD)
His will famously left his second best
bed to his widow But it made no
mention of a single book or
manuscript

The actor who will play Ben JONSON (mid 30s) appears
in the wings bearded ready to go on stage holding a
prop leather manuscript Behind him a group of
Elizabethan soldiers strap on their swords

ON STAGE
Prologue continues as do TITLES

PROLOGUE (CONTD)
Is it possible Shakespeare owned no
books at his death because he could
not read That he wrote no letters
because he like his father before him
and his children after him could not
write
(lets that sink in then)
Our Shakespeare is a cypher a ghost
his biography made not by history
but by conjecture His story not
written with facts but with
imagination

The rain has intensified Prologue turns and the
camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END

PROLOGUE (CONTD)
(more energetic)
So Let me offer you a different
story A darker story Of quills
and swords Of power and betrayal
Of a stage conquered and a throne
lost

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING and for a moment only sheets of
RAIN are visible No stage no Prologue Then

trough the rain we see a form of a man Ben
Jonson running Then we make out the shapes of
houses a street Were not on a stage anymore We
are

6 EXT BANKSIDE LONDON - 1604 NIGHT

Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street
toward a large circular theater

He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--

7 INT THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT
--and he quickly bolts it behind him turns and

desperately looks for a place to hide He runs towards
the stage as--

8 EXT THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door They
are led by Sir Richard POLE Captain of the Guard

POLE
Break it down

And several of the guards charge the door with their
pikes HITTING it hard

POLE (CONTD)
Again
INT THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

Jonson hurries backstage and disappears from our view
just as--

EXTINT THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS 10
--the guards SMASH the door open Pole is the first
in
POLE
Jonson Jonson Show yourself

The soldiers immediately spread out into different
parts of the theater Jonsons gone Because--

JONSON

has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat
trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of
props and costumes (swords masks flags and banners
shields barrels canons etc) But Jonson freezes

when he sees--

pg 5

THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE STAGES FLOORBOARDS

--the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out Pole
amongst them

POLE (CONTD)
Out with you Jonson Well smoke
you out like a rat if we have to
(beat)
Jonson Jonson

Nothing A beat then--
POLE (CONTD)
(to a soldier)
Torch it

The soldier hesitates

POLE (CONTD)
Torch it All of you

The soldiers obey lighting fire to the walls the
galleries the columns as--

JONSON

GASPS in horror Desperate-- he spies an open metal
box nearby filled with un-used fireworks

He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then
places the bound manuscripts in their place then
closes the box Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--
FLAMES

--begin to take hold everywhere the columns at the
front of the stage the trompe-loeil walls the
seating galleries the columns

A TRAP DOOR

opens center-stage and Jonson JUMPS out the rapier in
his right hand ready for a fight But-- three
soldiers jump onto the stage pikes ready

Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of
the stage-- but then runs smack into four other
soldiers

Ballocks

Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins
wryly drops his sword Raises his hands in surrender

Pg

11 EXT THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT

Jonson his hands tied behind him is pushed through
the door Pole following

A small crowd of actors whores etc watch the

theater burn The guards have to push their way
through them

INSERT

The fire reaches the fireworks below the theaters
stage and--

BACK TO SCENE

-- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn
and see

THE THEATER

Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater

EXT THE THAMES RIVER - DAWN

A longboat carrying Jonson Pole and the guards makes
its way towards the Tower Of London

INT TOWER OF LONDON - AN INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN

Jonson is thrown into a chair a guard on either side
of him Its dark-- the only light coming from a few

torches in the walls and a large fire pit at the far
side of the room

An INTERROGATOR (30s) faces him Dressed all in
black he is wispy thin

INTERROGATOR
You are Benjamin Jonson playwright
Son of William Jonson glass-blower
son of James Jonson brick-layer

Jonson nods

INTERROGATOR (CONTD)
And have you ever been arrested
before Mr Jonson

JONSON
Im a writer arent I Of course
Ive bloody well been--

pg 7

And a guard BACKHANDS Jonson on the face full force--
hard enough to send Jonson and the chair to the ground
His nose starts to bleed

As the Guards pull him up the Interrogator looks
across the room-- there is someone else there a
FIGURE watching but cloaked in the darkness

Jonson notices the figure as well We hear a voice
from the darkness

FIGURE
Ask him about the plays

JONSON
(to the Interrogator)

Plays

(to the Figure)
Which would you prefer my lord A
pastoral An historical An
historical-pastoral or an hysterical
historical pastoral--

And SMACK Hes hit by the guards again He SPITS out
a tooth

INTERROGATOR
We are not interested in your plays
Jonson We are interested in the
plays given to you by Edward de Vere
Earl of Oxford

Jonson stares at him a beat and then looks into the
darkness

JONSON
Im sorry my lord but I am not sure I
know whereof you speak I have had
the honor of meeting his lordship--

And SMACK--
FLASH CUT TO

FACES

laughing Not in this room somewhere else Somewhere
outside Before we really understand what we are
seeing we are

BACK IN THE CELL
Jonson blinks trying to stay conscious His mouth is
ripped bleeding So is his nose

pg 8
The skin has broken on his forehead The Interrogator
leans into the bloody Jonson

INTERROGATOR
Where are the plays

Before Jonson even has a chance to answer-- SMACK

CUT TO
MORE FACES
Laughing We are
INT THE ROSE THEATER - DAY 14

SOUTHAMPTON (0S)
Well

TWO MEN

walk towards the theater Edward de Vere the
Earl of OXFORD an intensely handsome man His clothes
have seen better days

His companion is Henry Wriothesley Earl of SOUTHAMPTON Blonde attractive a bit of a pretty boy-- and
extremely enthusiastic
SOUTHAMPTON (CONTD)
Wonderful isnt it

OXFORD
(frowning slightly)
Well its certainly big
Pg-
SOUTHAMPTON

I promise you Edward youve seen
nothing like it before Nothing

OXFORD
Bricklayers and whores watching
Aristophones Youre quite right
Henry not only have I never witnessed
it Im not sure I care to

SOUTHAMPTON
(teasing)
Youre an elitist you know that

Edward
Oxford pauses at the entrance

OXFORD
There wont be puppets will there

Southampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER
who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay
outside) inside

USHER
My lords

INT THE ENTRY OF THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

The usher takes them up a flight of stairs Oxford
observes everything as they walk

SOUTHAMPTON
The stage-craft is quite spectacular
Far more elaborate than anything Ive
seen at court Ive witnessed be-
headings that god as my witness look
as real as at the Tower cannons fired
in battle

They come to the second floor where a SELLING-MAID has
a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much
like a match-stick girl

SELLING-MAID
Ale Mutton mi lord

Southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up
another flight of stairs

pg 10

SOUTHAMPTON
and last week they had some sort
of a device to hoist cherubs into the
air and fly over the entire audience

OXFORD
An apo mekhanes theds Deus ex
machina Machine of the Gods

And as they ascend up more stairs Oxford catches
glimpses of the stage and performance through the
rafters and over the heads of the attending audience

OXFORD (CONTD)
Whenever the Greeks wrote their heroes
into a situation from which they
couldnt write their way out--

Oxford is becoming intrigued by the theater almost
despite himself

OXFORD (CONTD)
--Out came the apo mekhanes theods
As when Hippolytus is saved by
Artemis or Medea flown to Athens
Always good for an apo mekhanes theds
was Euripides

Oxford continues up two steps behind Southampton

They come to the third floor and enter the box seating
area reserved for nobles giving Oxford his first real
look at the theater itself Oxford looks around and
sees-

FROM OXFORDS POV

Audience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids
SELLING food-- the actors ACTING

Its alive Magical

BACK TO OXFORD

Oxford takes it all in almost stunned by it

ON- STAGE

The actor William SHAKESPEARE plays a commoner
He is handsome sexy charismatic and holds a tankard
of ale and SWIGS from it constantly

Another actor SPENCER plays FASTIDIOUS a

pompous over-dressed caricature of a nobleman

pg 11

He wears an enormous feather on his hat Also on stage
is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40s) who plays
Sogliardo

SHAKESPEARE
And whither were you riding now
signior

FASTIDIOUS

Who I What a silly jests that
Whither should I ride but to the
court

SHAKESPEARE
O pardon me sir twenty places more
your hot-house your pig-house or
your whore-house

The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks
below at a buxom young lady among the groundlings

He smiles seductively She smiles back

BACKSTAGE

Jonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the
performance from behind a curtain silently speaking
the lines with the actors

IN THE RAISED SEATING

A group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an
air of judgement They are Christopher Kit MARLOWE young brilliant a bit foppish (he likes the
boys) Thomas NASHE (late 30s)-- a heavy-set a hard
drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER considered
a bit of a hack by his colleagues

They are called the Mermaids Wits because they
frequent a pub named The Mermaids Tavern

NASHE
(takes a swig of ale)
His second play and almost a full
house
(burps)
Hes got a wit does Jonson

MARLOWE
That might be so but like a grain of
wheat hid in a bushel of chaff you
shall seek all day ere you find it
and when you have it its not worth
the search

pg 12

The others smile as a WOMAN passes

WOMAN
Ale Ale

DEKKER
Marlowe-- spot me a few pence will
you Henslowe still owes me for
Shoemakers Holiday

MARLOWE
(retrieving coins)
That would be because no one saw
Shoemakers Holiday

DEKKER
Ale here

Marlowe gives the woman a few pennies as--

NASHE
Kit Isnt that one of your
unrequited loves in the box over

there

Marlowe glances across the theater and spots
Southampton siting next to Oxford

MARLOWE
(frowns)
But with whom Tell me not he prefers
the company of such old grey men as
that

Nashe squints

NASHE
I think-- yes by the beard thats
the Earl of Oxford Old Tom Hooker
used to play for him Had his own
acting troupe for private Court
performances and the like

DEKKER
I wonder if he needs any material

MARLOWE
Certainly not any of yours

NASHE
No no-- that was years ago Hada
falling out with the Queen I heard
Hes more of a recluse than a patron
these days

Pg

ON STAGE
Shakespeare points to Fastidious

SHAKESPEARE
Who he the noble there Why hes a
gull a fool no salt in him i the
earth man he looks like a fresh
salmon kept in a tub

Shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place
The more he talks the more the audience ROARS in
laughter

SHAKESPEARE (CONTD)
He sleeps with a musk-cat every night
and walks all day hangd in perfumed
chains for penance

A GROUNDLING
Oi So thats what I been smelling

More groundlings laugh Interestingly--
NOBLEMEN

in the box seats do not

ON STAGE

Shakespeare continues his rant speaking directly to
the groundlings

SHAKESPEARE
He has his skin tannd in civet to
make his complexion strong and the
sweetness of his youth lasting in the
sense of his sweet lady And sadly
the poor mans brain is lighter than
his feather

As the audience HOWLS in laughter we see

A NOBLEMAN

with a feathered hat gets up in fury and exits the
theater his lady with him The Audience LAUGHS at him
as he goes

ON STAGE

Shakespeare smiles triumphantly

pg 14

SHAKESPEARE (CONTD)
He is a good and empty puff but he
loves you well signior I wish you

well with him
OXFORD

Watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass
by

BACKSTAGE
Later in the play

Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig
from his tankard Hes actually drunk though his
performance didnt show it at all He spots Jonson
and grabs him

SHAKESPEARE (CONTD)
Jonson Wonderful dialogue
Wonderful I hope your next--

HENSLOWE (0C)
Will Will Shakespeare

Shakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE
(50S) heading his way

HENSLOWE (CONTD)
Thats not ale in that goblet is it

Shakespeare hides the goblet behind his back

SHAKESPEARE
Ale Me Drink during a performance
I am a professional sir
(burps)
A complete and--

He is interrupted by SCREAMS Not from actors on
stage but by the audience

IN THE THEATER

Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queens Guard
STORM into the theater Everyone tries to get out as
quickly as possible including the other actors Henry
CONDELL (20s) Thomas POPE (30s) William SLY SIR RICHARD POLE THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

--jumps on stage
pg 15

POLE
This play has been declared seditious
and illegal by Lord William Cecil

The audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil

POLE (CONTD)
All are herewith ordered to disperse
immediately

A GROUNDLING
Why dont you disperse William Cecils
arse

POLE
Arrest that man

IN OXFORDS BOX

SOUTHAMPTON
Damn it all Well Off to Essexs

He gets up Oxford does not seemingly interested in
the real drama below as everyone hurries from the
theater

SOUTHAMPTON (CONTD)
Edward

Oxford turns to him distracted and nods
ON STAGE
Jonson pushes his way on stage

JONSON
(to Pole)
Seditious Seditious Its a comedy
for gods sake Theres nothing
seditious about--

POLE
Oi is that right is it And you
know this because

JONSON
Because I wrote the bloody thing And-

POLE
Arrest him as well

Jonson is grabbed by guards

17 INT A JAIL CELL - DAY

Jonson is THROWN into the cell

A pox on you

And your carbuncled father

Jonson looks around-- the cell is filled with a dozen

or so other prisoners

People taxed to the point of

18 INT TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY

Robert Earl of ESSEX is playing tennis against
Southampton Hes handsome red-headed and we will

learn very ambitious

ESSEX

and how do the Cecils spend their
time and energy Shutting a theater
A theater for gods sake Its
madness No wonder the mob hates them

so

The court is inside and slightly different from
todays game the back walls are playable somewhat

like racquet-ball

Oxford sits on a bench watching Essex SLAMS a shot

but it goes--

OXFORD
Out

Essex looks furious but holds his tongue Southampton

prepares to serve

OXFORD (CONTD)
(to Southampton)
Henry how many people were at that
play

pg 17
Southampton pauses before serving
SOUTHAMPTON
Hmm Im not sure two thousand
maybe more
Southampton SERVES Essex returns and another heated

rally begins

OXFORD
And how many performances are there of
a play like that

SOUTHAMPTON
Five or six I suppose

He HITS the ball again and this time Essex misses it

ESSEX
By the--

OXFORD
(to Essex)
So Ten thousand souls All
listening to the writings of one man--
the ideas of one man Thats power
Robert And if there is one thing the
Cecils understand its power

ESSEX
(snorts)
And when did words ever win a kingdom
I think Ill keep my sword thank you
very much

Southampton SERVES as Oxford smiles at Essexs naiveté

19 INT CHANGING ROOMSESSEX HOUSE - DAY

Southampton and Essex are dressing out of their tennis
clothes and into their normal clothes assisted by two

valets
ESSEX
(to the valets)
Leave us
(they exit)
Henry Some of my men have
intercepted some of William Cecils
recent correspondence with King James
of Scotland
pg 18
Southampton pauses in clothing himself This is
serious
ESSEX (CONTD)
Cecils all but promising him the
throne
SOUTHAMPTON
To James Elizabeth would never agree
to-
ESSEX

Elizabeth is old Ill Not of her
old mind Sometimes she doesnt even
recognize me And yet still she
refuses to name an heir

SOUTHAMPTON
But a Scotsman On the Tudor throne

ESSEX
You are not in the Privy Council
Elizabeth does everything the Cecils
wish of her Everything

BEHIND THEM
Oxford enters They dont notice though He
instantly realizes he shouldnt say anything He
listens as

WIDER

ESSEX (CONTD)

Think Henry if James owes Cecil his
throne Cecil will have more influence
in the next reign than he does in this
one And after William Cecil his
hunch-backed son will take his
place
(careful)
That is why we must do everything in
our power to ensure that the right man
succeeds her

(beat)
A man deserving of the Tudor crown

Southampton stiffens at that last phrase

ESSEX (CONTD)
I ask you for the support of you and
your men Henry if it comes to a
fight

pg 19
Southampton looks at Essex hard
SOUTHAMPTON
You know you need not ask I stand

with you as I always have

Essex smiles at him warmly They both HEAR something
shuffle behind them They turn and see

WHERE OXFORD WAS STANDING

Nothing He is gone

BACK TO SOUTHAMPTON AND ESSEX

They exchange a slightly worried look

CUT TO
20 EXT

ESSEX HOUSE - DAY

Moments later Oxford and Southampton are exiting the
elaborate building that serves as Essexs London

residence
OXFORD
Essex played rather poorly didnt he
Southampton just nods distracted Oxford reaches out

to him and touches his shoulder

OXFORD (CONTD)
(warning)
Henry The Cecils brook no rivals

Southampton pauses confused for an instant then--

SOUTHAMPTON
(re his discussion with
Essex)
You heard

Oxford nods

They

They stop

SOUTHAMPTON (CONTD)
Always concerned for me arent you
Edward

keep walking towards Southamptons men

SOUTHAMPTON (CONTD)
And what would you have me do

pg 20
OXFORD
I would have you deny him

SOUTHAMPTON
The son of the Queen

OXFORD
That is rumor only Henry--

Southampton makes sure that his men are out

of earshot

SOUTHAMPTON

Rumor My god all you have to do is
look at Essex to see the Queens
reflection Everyone thinks hes her
son everyone And I for one would
rather bow to a Tudor bastard though
he may be than a Scotsman

OXFORD

I desire nothing more than to see the
next king be the rightful king But
what Essex contemplates will surely
lead to Civil War

(beat)
No If this is to be done it must be
done carefully skillfully

SOUTHAMPTON
As I heard it Elizabeth exiled you
from her presence for the last twenty
years because of your skill at Court
politics

And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said
that

OXFORD
I only have your interests in mind
Henry For as you so rightly point
out my interests are already lost

SOUTHAMPTON
I know Forgive me You know how I
feel about you You have been a great
friend to me ever since my father
died I promise you that I will do
nothing rash without consulting you
first

Oxford nods still worried and Southampton heads for
his horse

Pg

OXFORD
Henry Will you do me one thing more
Deliver a gift for me A rather
elaborate gift

EXT CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET 21

The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor
house its enormous and very ornate and intricate in
design

It faces the river and has an elaborate docking area
which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting
the noblemen off for a week-end get away

INT CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK 22

Most of Englands nobility is assembled in small
groups talking Its a dour quiet affair Some
music no life Quite Puritan

Southampton is there but Essex and Oxford are nowhere
to be seen

A HUNCH-BACKED MAN

--makes his way through the room causing conversations
to cease as he walks by Even the most senior of the
nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him This
is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30s)

He pauses near Southampton

SOUTHAMPTON
Sir Robert

ROBERT CECIL
My lord of Southampton
(looking around)
Have you seen Essex

SOUTHAMPTON
I believe he is still in the viewing
chamber with her majesty

ROBERT CECIL
(sharp annoyed)
Alone

pg 22
SOUTHAMPTON
(smiles)
With your father in London dealing
with all the troubles in Ireland who
else should the Queen turn to but
Essex

Robert Cecil looks annoyed but holds his tongue as the
SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall

A FOOTMAN clears his throat and--

FOOTMAN

By the grace of god her majesty
Elizabeth Queen of England Wales and
Ireland

DOUBLE DOORS

open and Elizabeth (in her 60s) enters She is
wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a
wide collar

She walks slowly and carefully and has a slight tremor
in her head and hands She seems un-certain like

shes not sure she recognizes all the faces around her
(Alzheimers) And she compensates for it by being

all the more regal all the more un-human

Essex is on her arm dressed in a splendid jewel-
encrusted doublet

Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm
Essex ignores Cecils glare notices Southampton--

ESSEX
(to Elizabeth)
Ah-- Majesty Ive been told my lord
of Southampton has a gift for you

ELIZABETH
(eyes sparkle)
A gift

SOUTHAMPTON
Yes your grace though not from me

Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room
OPENS

A DWARF enters followed by dancing faires actors
swirling sparklers and musicians playing music

pg 23

Elizabeths rheumy eyes widen in complete delight a
smile of total jubilation crosses her face

Robert Cecil on the other hand looks horrified

ELIZABETH
Are you this gift my precious little
man

DWARF

No no my most majestic majesty I
am a free man My gift is a play
majesty

ELIZABETH
A play

The dwarf bows his assent

ROBERT CECIL
(to the Dwarf)
Plays are the work of the devil born
from a cesspool of plague whoredom
thievery fornication and heresy
You may tell your master that her
majesty--

ESSEX
(interrupting)
--Will gladly accept your gift

Robert Cecil turns to Essex shocked

ESSEX (CONTD)
(to Elizabeth)
Of course that is if you so desire
majesty
(to Robert Cecil)
The choice is her majestys to make
not yours Is that not so Sir Robert

Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around unsure of the
political tides around her Then--

ELIZABETH

(to the dwarf)

Elizabeth lets go of Essex and offers her hand to the
Dwarf who smiles brightly

ELIZABETH (CONTD)
Lead us to this gift

And the Dwarf leads Elizabeth towards the door Essex
follows and Southampton locks into step next to him
They exchange a knowing look as--

Robert Cecil steps in line far after the Queen not
happy with this turn of events as we hear--

QUINCE (0S)

EXT THE GROUNDS AT CECIL HOUSE - NIGHT

Sheer magic Candles everywhere in stakes in the
ground in the trees They light a make-shift stage
surrounded by huge oak trees on three sides

I see their knavery this is to make
an ass of me to fright me if they

course) She loves it SQUEALING in delight like a

ON STAGE

Several actors are mid-scene in A Midsummer Nights
Dream (Act 3 Scene 1) their make-up quite elaborate
and fantastical Bottom who is costumed as a man--
except that he has a DONKEYS HEAD Quince a
commoner Puck played by the dwarf who is now
dressed like a cupid and Titania Queen of the
fairies who is presently asleep in a bed of fur Puck
hides behind a tree watching

BOTTOM (CONTD)
I will walk up and down here and I
will sing that they shall hear I am
not afraid

Oxford watches from behind a curtain carefully
observing the Queens reaction Somehow we feel that
seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep
emotion in him

With orange-tawny bill
The throstle with his note so true

ELIZABETH

strongly reacts to Titania awakening It stirs some
memory in her A pleasant memory

OXFORD
watches delighted by her reaction
FROM HIS POV

We see Elizabeth watching But it is an Elizabeth only
26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this
script) We HEAR the sound of other dialogue but from
the same play We are

Thirty-eight years earlier And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches
an earlier slightly less sophisticated staging of A
Midsummer Nights Dream (the costumes and sets are a
bit more thrown together)

All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so

FROM BACKSTAGE

A boy watches in the exact same position as we just saw
Oxford This is BOY OXFORD-- now only 10 years old

But he is made up and wears a winged costume for the
character of Puck

A STERN LOOKING MAN

is watching a few seats away from Young Elizabeth He
is WILLIAM CECIL (40s Roberts father) He is a
Puritan dressed all in black (with a white lace
collar) and has a long beard He is frowning

loathing the play

pg 27

ON STAGE

PUCK (CONTD)
So good night unto you all Give me
your hands if we be friends and

The play now over Young Elizabeth applauds with
delight as do the small group of courtiers all around
her

YOUNG ELIZABETH
Lovely Lovely

CUT TO

INT HEDINGHAM CASTLE - KITCHEN - LATER

A make-shift back-stage where all the young actors
are removing their costumes and make-up including Boy

Oxford who sits in front of a make-shift leaning
mirror

Much excited talking and commotion until Boy Oxford

notices everyone has gone silent He turns-- his winged

costume still on-- just as--

YOUNG ELIZABETH (0S)
Ah There he is

Young Elizabeth and her senior Court including William

Cecil and John De Vere have entered
Boy Oxford bows deeply

YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(to Boy Oxford)
Your father tells me you wrote this
evenings play yourself

Boy Oxford glances at his father-- should he answer
directly His father NODS

BOY OXFORD
I did indeed your majesty

YOUNG ELIZABETH
You sport with me
(smiling)
Compose something

BOY OXFORD
Now

pg 28
YOUNG ELIZABETH
Yes Now

BOY OXFORD
On what subject your grace

She thinks Then--
YOUNG ELIZABETH
(smiles)

Truth

BOY OXFORD
(thinks then--)

For Truth is Truth
Though never so old

and time cannot make that false
which once was true

She smiles claps

YOUNG ELIZABETH
(to John de Vere)
My lord of Oxford It seems you have
added a poet to your familys long
line of warriors

BOY OXFORD
Madam I am as accomplished with the
sword and the musket as I am with
verse

YOUNG ELIZABETH
(amused)
Are you indeed

BOY OXFORD
(nods seriously)
It is my only desire to one day be
your majestys most trusted servant in
matters both of war and state if you
will but have me

YOUNG ELIZABETH
(charmed)
Why Lord Cecil it seems we may very
well have found your replacement

WILLIAM CECIL
We hope not too soon majesty we hope
not too soon

pg 29

YOUNG ELIZABETH
(teasing)
And how liked you our young lords
play William

William Cecil stiffens in discomfort

YOUNG ELIZABETH (CONTD)
(to Boy Oxford
conspiratorially)
Our Lord Cecil is our most religious
of subjects and no doubt thinks your
little masque will deliver your soul
straight into the arms of Lucifer
himself Dont you William

The Boy Oxford looks at William Cecil perplexed by
such a thing

WILLIAM CECIL
That is Gods decision your majesty
Not mine

William Cecil looks directly at John de Vere resulting
in an uncomfortable silence

Elizabeth notices
YOUNG ELIZABETH
Well if plays are indeed such a sin
I pray I do not find my salvation
until very late in life

Boy Oxford smiles He might very well be in love

INT A JAIL CELL - DAY

Thirty-eight years later The door SWEEPS open anda
snoring sleeping Jonson is awakened by--

GUARD (0S)
Jonson Ben Jonson

The other prisoners make way as the guard approaches
Jonson The guard tosses a wax-sealed piece of

parchment onto Jonsons lap

GUARD (CONTD)
Youve been released

Jonson looks at it confused

Pg

GUARD (CONTD)
Got powerful friends now dont you

26A EXT A BOAT - RIVER THAMES - DAY

26A
Jonson is in a noblemans longboat (for the first time
in his life) Across from him sits FRANCESCO--
Italian 60s-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat
of arms on its chest

The City of London is far in the distance

Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat
for a moment before--

JONSON
And who are you

Francesco just stares back

JONSON (CONTD)
And where are we going

Francesco is silent
WIDER

The boat approaches a large stone house Oxford Stone

CUT TO
A RED ROSE
as it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands We
are

27 EXT OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY

Oxford smells the rose inhaling its essence Then he
turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards
him

Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De
Vere (40s) who sits in the distance knitting with one
of their daughters BRIDGET Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand
place Jonson CLEARS his throat
JONSON
My lord

pg 31

OXFORD
The Tudor rose The most beautiful of
flowers dont you think

JONSON
It looks to me to have quite a number
of thorns my lord

OXFORD
So it does So it does

JONSON
I am told my lord that I owe my
freedom to you

OXFORD
That is true And it was quite hard
to come by One does not cross my
father-in-law lightly

Jonson doesnt know who he is talking about

OXFORD (CONTD)
Lord William Cecil I have the
questionable distinction of being
married to his only daughter

Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them
suspiciously He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and
Francesco to follow

OXFORD (CONTD)
It did however serve as helpful when
I wrote to your jailers to release you
in my father-in-laws name

Jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back
to Anne

JONSON
(in a panicked whisper)
My lord-- Im sorry does that mean my
release is not officially sanctioned

OXFORD
Dont be an idiot Jonson of course it
wasnt
(beat)
But you are free are you not

They have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne
watches them as they disappear into the maze

Pg

28 EXT MAZE - DAY
Oxford turns to Jonson

OXFORD
I enjoyed your little comedy last
week Jonson You have potential
great potential

JONSON
Thank you my lord

OXFORD
But its politics did seem to have
quite an effect on the Tower My
father-in-laws men felt it quite
seditious

JONSON
Politics My play had nothing to do
with politics It was just a simple
comedy--

OXFORD

That showed your betters as fools who
go through life barely managing to get
food from plate to mouth were it not
for the cleverness of their servants

(beat)
All art is political Jonson
Otherwise it would just be decoration
And all artists have something to say
otherwise theyd make shoes And
youre not a cobbler are you Jonson

As they enter the center of the maze Oxford turns to
his servant

OXFORD (CONTD)
(nods)
Francesco

Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather
bound manuscript Jonson looks at it confused and
opens it

JONSON
A play my lord

OXFORD
One you shall stage Bankside

JONSON
Stage

pg 33

OXFORD
Under your name

JONSON
My name my lord

OXFORD
I cant very well use my name can I
Im the seventeenth Earl of Oxford
The Lord Great Chamberlain of England
Viscount Bolebec Lord Escales
Sandford and Badlesmere etc etc
No I have a reputation to
protect In my world one does not
write plays Jonson People like you
do

Jonson tries not to be offended

JONSON
Yes My lord You wrote an entire
play my lord I know how difficult--

OXFORD
Not a play Jonson Ive written many
No doubt many more than you yourself
A good number performed at Court years
ago others never seen by a living

soul

JONSON
And you want me to apply my name to
this play

OXFORD

No I mean you to put your name to
all of them

JONSON
All of them

OXFORD
Well dont look like I just gutted
your pet dog Jonson I mean to make
you the most popular-- and therefore
the most monetarily successful--
playwright in all of London

Jonson pales This is a disaster for him

OXFORD (CONTD)
I wish you god speed and good morrow

Jonson looks down at the manuscript reads a few lines

pg 34

JONSON
My lord-- I really--

He looks up but Oxford is gone having left the maze
without so much as a good-bye

JONSON (CONTD)
My lord

But before he can follow Francesco tosses a leather
pouch of coins at his feet

FRANCESCO
That is for your trouble Signor
Jonson And your silence If I hear
you break that silence then not so
good for Signor Jonson

And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks
up the pouch examining its contents

And then Jonson realizes he doesnt know how to get out
of the maze He chases after them

JONSON
Hello My lord I--

And hes lost He looks this way and that then picks

a path

(the wrong one)

EXT CECIL HOUSE - DAY

Robert Cecil is standing at the opulent river entrance
to Cecil House waiting for an enormous barge docking
William Cecil (now 75) is at the front of the barge
waiting to disembark He constantly holds an ornately
carved white cane

WILLIAM CECIL
So I am gone for three days and you
somehow manage to let her spend all of
them solely in the company of the Earl
of Essex

Robert Cecil looks at him sharply How did he know

WILLIAM CECIL (CONTD)
Dont think because I was in London I
didnt know exactly what went on here
in my absence

pg 35

ROBERT CECIL
He is an Earl father I cannot deny
him--

WILLIAM CECIL

Of course not You dont deny him
anything You find excuses She is
unwell she is reading she is seeing
the Ambassador from Russia For Gods
sake use your imagination Robert
Whatever will you do when I am gone

(beat)
We will have to deal with Essex soon
His ambitions are becoming a nuisance

INT CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

William Cecil enters an impressive hallway and turns to

his son

WILLIAM CECIL
Now tell me about the play

Robert Cecil looks surprised for an instant that he
knows about that as well

ROBERT CECIL
It-- it was an anonymous gift Essex
insisted it be performed just to
spite me in front of Court

WILLIAM CECIL
Of course he did
(concerned)
But what was it about

ROBERT CECIL
About Some nonsense about fairies
and cherubs

WILLIAM CECIL
And dancing asses

Robert looks surprised at his father who has stopped
suddenly

WILLIAM CECIL (CONTD)
(realizing to himself)
Edward
(to Robert Cecil)
Have you any idea what you have-- No
how could you

pg 36

And he starts back up the stairs

ROBERT CECIL
Father It was just a play

WILLIAM CECIL
And do you know how long it took me to

banish them from her presence She
adores them Adores them And Edward
knows it

(beat)
Mark my words Robert he has done
this for a purpose

ROBERT CECIL
Purpose What purpose

WILLIAM CECIL

(thinking to himself)
What purpose indeed

(to Robert)
But through your carelessness I must
now deal not only with Essex but
Edward as well For whether in shadow
or in person Edward has returned to
Court

And with that he slams the door shut
Robert Cecil walks over to a nearby window Visibly
upset he starts to stare out of the window and

remembers

INT CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY 32
And it is thirty years earlier

BOY ROBERT CECIL (now 9) is staring out of the window

His back must have been deformed either in utero or at

birth because even now he is hunchbacked

pg 37
WILLIAM CECIL(OS)
(more commanding)
Robert Come here

Finally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford
(now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and
his wife and daughter Young ANNE In front of
them lined up are several men whom we will learn are
TUTORS

Boy Robert Cecil doesnt move

WILLIAM CECIL (CONTD)
(to Young Oxford)
I am sorry my lord But my son
Robert prefers the company of
himself

Boy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his
mother and sister

WILLIAM CECIL (CONTD)
May I present my wife Lady Cecil and
my daughter Anne

Young Anne curtsies

YOUNG ANNE
I am sorry for your loss my lord
The realm lost a great lord with your
fathers death We hope you will be
happy in our house--

BOY ROBERT CECIL (0S)
Are you going to live here forever

Everybody turns and sees the odd hunchback child has
finally come over

YOUNG OXFORD
(smiles)
No Only until I reach my maturity

BOY ROBERT CECIL
Why

WILLIAM CECIL
Because the Queen has bade it so
(to Young Oxford)
My lord when we first met you said
you wished to become a great man of
State Both the Queen and I hope to
make that so
(MORE)

pg 38

WILLIAM CECIL (CONTD)
To that end I have the honor of
introducing you to your tutors
(indicates one of them)
Seven to eight you shall be tutored in
French by Mister Crane--

YOUNG OXFORD
Monsieur Ca me fait plaisir de vous
connaitre

Master Crane bows his head

WILLIAM CECIL
Nine to ten is Greek with Mister
Simmons

YOUNG OXFORD

BOY ROBERT CECIL

YOUNG OXFORD

No Plato

Boy Robert frowns at the correction

WILLIAM CECIL
(slight frown then)
And you know your uncle Mister
Golding who has petitioned me to
allow you to assist him in his
translations of ancient Latin texts
into English

YOUNG OXFORD
(in Latin)
Continetne ut spero Ovidii
Metamorphose Mihi honori erit

Mister Golding bows his head in appreciation
WILLIAM CECIL
Then cosmography with Doctor Richards
Two to three is geography and history
and four to five fencing

William Cecil seems to have finished

pg 39

YOUNG OXFORD
(to William Cecil)
And composition Poetry

WILLIAM CECIL
This is a Puritan home your grace
We believe such activities to be the
worship of false idols and therefore
a sin before the eyes of God

YOUNG OXFORD
A sin But surely there must be room
for beauty and art in life my lord

WILLIAM CECIL
Not in this household
INT CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY
Young Oxford is fencing with a tutor Hes quite good
In fact hes better than the tutor who is twice his

age

Boy Robert Cecil casually watches as he plays chess
against himself

Young Oxford with a fierce beautifully executed
attack disarms his tutor The tutors sword FLIES
into the air and hits--

THE CHESS BOARD

making the pieces scatter

WIDER

Boy Robert Cecil looks up his face furious to see

Young Oxford coming over to him

YOUNG OXFORD
You were losing anyway

I was also winning

Young Oxford picks up the sword throws it to his
tutor who catches it

BOY ROBERT CECIL

(CONT D)
You know I am going to one day succeed

Young Oxford motions to go then picks up the black
king and tosses it to Boy Robert Cecil who cant

catch it because of his deformity It CLANGS on the
floor

Moments later the Young Oxford heads down the hall
alone heading for his rooms his sword still in his
hand
CUT TO

POEMS

neatly written on parchment We are

INT CECIL HOUSE - YOUNG OXFORDS ROOM - DAY

And a SERVANT is looking at the poems then quickly
stuffing them into a bag

But then he HEARS footsteps coming Panicked he looks
for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door--
he runs to it-- the door is locked

So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens
and Young Oxford enters

After a few steps Young Oxford senses something amiss
Looks at his--

WRITING DESK

where the parchments are scattered

YOUNG OXFORD

goes to his desk picks up one of the pieces of
parchment It has poetry on it His poetry He goes
through some other pages And realizes other pages are

missing He becomes infuriated He sees--

UNDER THE TAPESTRY

Two feet

pg 41
WIDER
Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry sword in hand He

THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry

The man screams in agony as he falls He doesnt just
die but screams and screams and screams

Young Oxford steps back-- half in horror half in
triumph The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to

INT THE ROSE THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DAY

Thirty-three years later

Shakespeare is on stage taking a bow The audience is
APPLAUDING and SCREAMING their approval of a
performance that has just ended He steps backwards--

BACKSTAGE

gave him

SHAKES PEARE
Is it any good

JONSON
How in blazes should I know

SHAKES PEARE
You havent even read it

And Shakespeare is drawn back--

--so Jonson can answer him
JONSON
I read a line or two-- I promised
Henslowe Id finish Eastward Ho by

Saturday

SHAKES PEARE
And you say hes a nobleman

Jonson doesnt answer

pg 42
SHAKESPEARE (CONTD)
Powerful Rich
Jonson still doesnt answer which is answer enough
SHAKESPEARE (CONTD)
Ohhhh you have to do it then dont

you

And Shakespeare goes back on stage

37 EXT BANKSIDE LONDON - DAY

Jonson and Shakespeare are walking along Bankside
still mid-conversation They pass all sorts of vendors
selling fish fresh water food etc

JONSON
I tell you Will-- I came to London to
become a great poet to to be the
conscience of our times the soul of
our age To change the world not to
become someone elses--

SHAKESPEARE
(amused)
Change the world With rhyme

JONSON
Yes why not Why cant a man change
the world with words

Shakespeare laughs at him

JONSON (CONTD)

(mimicking Oxford)
I can make you the most popular and
the richest playwright in all of
London

(takes a swig)
Ballocks I can do that myself thank
you very much

38 INT THE MERMAIDS TAVERN - NIGHT

Shakespeare is perusing the manuscript Some of the
actors from the Rose are in the BG

SHAKESPEARE
You know its actually not half

Jonson takes a swig of ale then--

JONSON
Not half-- Youre an actor what in
Gods name do you know about writing
Hes an amateur Will a complete and
utter amateur Last week gardening
this week playwrighting next week

(takes another swig)
No I wont do it It would be an
affront against the Muses

SHAKES PEARE
(smiles)
Well we musnt offend the muses
whatever we do
(thinks then)
How much money did you say he gave
you

JONSON
What you think my name can be bought
if the numbers great enough do you

Shakespeare smiles enigmatically

SHAKES PEARE
No not at all I think we should
keep your good name quite intact

Jonson frowns confused as we--

financial aid and even troops We
must act quickly

William Cecil hesitates slightly then--

WILLIAM CECIL
I would recommend the Earl of Essex
your majesty

For how long

WILLIAM CECIL
As long as the present crisis
warrants majesty

ELIZABETH
Impossible He cannot be spared We
feel his counsel is of greater import
with each passing day

Not what William Cecil wanted to hear

able subjects where they are most
needed majesty

effort)

heretic Give him a foot-hold in
Ireland and--

WILLIAM CECIL

Essexs martial abilities are in my
opinion the only antidote to the
plague of Philip

Though Essex would not
unfortunately be able to remain in
the Privy Council if he is in

Ireland

ELIZABETH
And who would you advise to replace
him

Three ladies-in-waiting approach with three different
gown Elizabeth studies them as

WILLIAM CECIL

invaluable to me and no doubt will be
to you as well

Elizabeth points to one of the dresses and waves the
handmaidens away

ELIZABETH
Yes yes yes We will send Essex to
Ireland and place Robert on my Privy
Council

But Williams flash of victory is dampened by--

ELIZABETH (CONTD)

I saw a play this last weekend

William It made me think of days
long past Of memories long past
Long past I should like to see more

make a claim you cannot retract I
have been legally reimbursed for your
education and living expenses

YOUNG OXFORD

looks behind him stunned by the number

Oxford looks up and down the cabinet He pulls one

right one He pulls another out then hands it to
Jonson

INT OXFORD STONE - HALLWAY - DAY

Jonson exits Oxfords study still amazed at the
manuscript as he walks

He passes ANNE Oxfords wife (now 40s) who is on her
way to the study with their eldest daughter BRIDGET pg 56

She watches him go by and immediately realizes that she
has seen him before But she stays silent

INT OXFORD STONE - STUDY - DAY
Oxford is writing at a desk as Anne enters

ANNE
Who was that man Ive seen him
before

Oxford holds up a finger to prevent her from speaking
while he finishes writing a thought Its a long
thought Anne is obviously annoyed and interrupts
him

ANNE (CONTD)
Edward-- we must discuss our Bridgets
dowry

OXFORD
(looking up - confused)

Dowry
He remembers when he spies his daughter

ANNE
She cannot go into marriage without a
dowry that is becoming to the daughter
of the Earl Oxford

OXFORD
I can give her Brooke House and a
hundred pounds

BRIDGET

A hundred pounds Father Mother
OXFORD

That is all we have to give at the

moment
The matter over Oxford goes back to his writing

ANNE

Edward Edward Speak to me Our
family is in financial ruins and and
you you play the flute while Rome
burns

Oxford turns

pg 57

OXFORD
Nero fiddled whilst Rome burned

And then he goes back to writing

ANNE
For gods sake who cares Edward
When your own daughter cant even have
a suitable dowry

She stares at him

ANNE (CONTD)
My god youre writing again arent
you After you agreed-- after my
father expressly forbade it

Oxford turns to her full of emotion

OXFORD
Anne-- If you could have seen them--
the mob They they didnt just sit

there like the reptilia of court
faces motionless fangs momentarily
retracted No They they jumped on
stage they fought the French A
butcher-- he actually broke his arm
He was so--

ANNE
Stop Stop it at once

Anne storms over and grabs the parchment from under
him and begins RIPPING it up

ANNE (CONTD)
Why Why must you write Why must
you continue to humiliate this family

He stares at her almost uncomprehendingly Then--

OXFORD
The voices Anne The voices I I
cant stop them They they come
when I sleep when I wake when I sup
when I I I walk down a hall The
sweet longings of a maiden the the
surging ambitions of a courtier the
foul designs of a murderer the
wretched pleas of his victims Only-
- only when I put their words-- their
voices-- to parchment are they cast
loose freed Only then is my
mind quieted at peace

pg 58

Anne steps back frightened of him
OXFORD (CONTD)
I would go mad if I didnt write
down the voices

She stares at him horrified

ANNE

Art thou possessed
He stares back at her A long beat

EXT LONDON BRIDGE - DAY

Shakespeare and Jonson are walking along London Bridge--
the only bridge that spanned the Thames at the time it
is a street lined with multi-storied buildings-- almost
like a mall

Shakespeare caries and reads from a manuscript of
Romeo and Juliet

SHAKESPEARE

mutiny Where civil blood makes civil
hands unclean

Incredible The whole bloody thing

JONSON

try

Jonson gives him a sharp look and pauses to pick some
onions from a stand

Shakespeare notices a BUXOM BLONDE women selling apples
at the next stand

SHAKESPEARE (CONTD)
(performing for the

Blonde)
But soft what light through yonder
window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious
moon
Who is already sick and pale with
grief That thou her maid art far more
fair than she

The Buxom Blonde smiles at Shakespeare seductively

SHAKESPEARE (CONTD)
(to Jonson)
Ill have little trouble parting the
legs of barmaids after that
performance

JONSON
You cant play Romeo

Jonson leaves the stall and continues down the street
Shakespeare hesitates then gives the girl a dazzling
smile She smiles back then Shakespeare runs after
Jonson

SHAKES PEARE

(to Jonson)
Why not I wont let that oaf Spencer
have another go at one of my roles
No-- only Will Shakespeare can pump
the life into Romeos veins

(grins at another passing

girl)
And his cod piece

(beat desperate)
Ben-- Ben Im an actor every inch
of me down to my very toes I want-

steps towards her as--

YOUNG OXFORD
O Mistress mine where are you

roaming
O stay and hear your true-loves
coming
That can--
(looks up and down her
body)

--kiss both high and low

A bit stunned by his approach she stumbles backwards
on her sheets

Trip no further pretty sweeting

But hes sexy and naked And spouting poetry She
stops retreating and allows his approach

Journeys end in lovers meeting--
Every wise mans son doth know

A small smile escapes her lips

What is love tis not hereafter
Present mirth hath present laughter
Whats to come is still unsure

He starts to kiss her neck Cautiously at first But
she likes it

YOUNG OXFORD (CONTD)
In delay there lies no plenty--
Then come kiss me Sweet-and-twenty
Youths a stuff will not endure

She responds to him melting from both his words and
touch They start to kiss deeply passionately And-

AFTER EACH PERFORMANCE

Shakespeare bows to the ever-increasing applause of his
audience He looks up to see the Mermaids Wits all

watching him with stony silence

And as each play is seen Jonson and the rest of the
Wits seem more and more depressed

And after each performance Shakespeare seems to be

of William Cecil dressed in black with an exaggerated
rendition of Cecils beard

Beware of entrance to a quarrel
but being in bear it that the opposed
may beware of thee Give every man
thy ear but few thy voice take each
mans censure but reserve thy
judgment

INT WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - DAY

We see Elizabeth smiling amused as Polinous continues
his rant

POLINOUS
Costly thy habit as thy purse can
buy but not expressed in fancy rich
nor gaudy for the apparel oft
proclaims the man This above all to
thine own self be true

irritated by some sort of itch but still focused on
the play

pigs blood and dies an anguished death

There is stunned silence in the audience And then one
lone Groundling CLAPS then another then the whole
audience

vigorously as some of the members of court give
uncomfortable glances at each other over the death of
William Cecil-- er Polonius onstage

Nay I know not Is it the King

HAMLET (CONTD)
Thou wretched rash intruding fool
farewell I took thee for thy better
take thy fortune Thou findst to be
too busy is some danger Leave
wringing of your hands peace sit you
down And let me wring your heart for

penetrable stuff
If damned custom have not brassd it

open her bodice and violently scratches some sort of
rash on her chest

INTEXT ROSE THEATER - DAY

Oxford is in his usual box but completely alone He
has a smile of satisfaction on his lips while

JONSON

Looks over to Oxford with astonishment While on
stage the world sees for the first time Hamlet
contemplating suicide

HAMLET
To be or not to be that is the
question whether “tis nobler in the
mind to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune or to take arms
against a sea of troubles and by

opposing end them
Loud thunder and
RAIN STARTS TO FALL

And as only the stage and the galleries are covered
the groundlings are pelted with the cold drops of
water But they stay They stay They cover
themselves up and silently watch on

“HAMLET
To die to sleep- no more- and by a
sleep to say we end the heartache and
the thousand natural shocks that flesh
is heir to

The audience-- soaked pelted with rain-- watches
immobile

And then a again a loud thunder clap takes us to the
end of the play

popular as you say we would only
anger the mob No We must strike at

William Cecil slowly-- and shakily-- bends down from
his chair as--

pacing again

joke about a nobleman of no
consequence and we find ourselves in

himself and still whores all the way

is my witness you may well find
yourself doing the same before you

carrying a tray with a silver pitcher approaches A
guard opens the tent for him to enter

INT ESSEXS TENT - CONTINUOUS

Essex is having a Council of War with his generals and

around a table consulting a map of Ireland

ESSEX

If the Rebels have stripped the
northern borders Then we must
march south and take Cahir

The SERVANT stays in the background as he pours wine
into various goblets Southampton notices him-- the
servants hand shakes as he pours the wine

GENERAL

Southampton notices the Servants shaking hand slipping
into a pocket as--

To Establish A foggy day In the Foreground we see
the maze Oxford and his fencing master BEAULIEU

rapiers for exercise

They wear outfits that are slightly more protective
than ornamental

They duel for a few moments and then Oxford TOUCHES
Beaulieus shoulder The speak entirely in French

Oxford backs off as does the fencing master

OXFORD

Bien Faisons du travail le Coup

BEAULIE
Mais oui mon seigneur

OXFORD
Bien En garde

And they once again begin to duel But we quickly
surmise something is amiss Beaulieu is much more
aggressive than he was before Oxford realizes it but
is an expert swordsman and defends himself well

And then Beaulieu aggressively moves forward and STABS
Oxford in the leg

OXFORD (CONTD)
Quest ce que vous faites

But Oxford has little chance to react because Beaulieu
continues his attack

OXFORD (CONTD)

This has become an assassination attempt not an
exercise

Francesco is entering the maze with a silver tray
carrying a pitcher and two goblets

Though wounded Oxford is a superior swordsman And he
begins his own attack-- with a ferocity that surprises
Beaulieu

Oxford PIERCES Beaulieus heart with his rapier and
Beaulieu SCREAMS--

Francesco hears the scream and starts to run

Signor Signor

IN THE CENTER OF THE MAZE
Oxford collapses as Francesco rushes in
FRANCESCO (CONTD)

no avail as--

played as a hunch-back

Pole realizes this is significant

INT CECIL HOUSE - THE PRIVATE CHAPEL - DAWN

actor stops for a moment But then he finds the courage
again to continue

Jonson looks down at the Groundlings reaction and
spots--

ROBERT CECIL (CONTD)
Elizabeth had several children
Edward not just yours She was
sixteen for the first Bloody Mary
was still Queen and our future
Gloriana was out of favor No one
thought her very important at all
Except my father of course And when
her first child was born a male my
father took it and hid it The
grandson of Henry VIII the foundling
of course had to be reared a nobleman
John De Vere the previous Earl of
Oxford agreed to accept the task

Oxford goes ashen

OXFORD
You lie

ROBERT CECIL

Do I

(beat)
Why do you think he worked so hard to
become your guardian after your father
died He had it all planned years in
advance He would teach you
everything he knew about statecraft
marry his daughter and after
Elizabeths death proclaim you heir
His own grandchild to follow you on
the throne But he couldnt possibly
predict what kind of failure you would
become How you would fail in
politics ignore your estates to the
point of bankruptcy all to write

(sotto)
You are the soul of the age

Oxford smiles at the thought of it Then--
OXFORD
Promise me promise me Jonson that

you will keep our secret safe That
you wont expose Shakespeare

JONSON
My lord
OXFORD
I have seen it in your face He

vexes you How could he not But he
is not your burden He is mine

Then he nods to the manuscripts by his side

OXFORD (CONTD)
All my writings The plays the
sonnets Keep them safe Keep them
from my family From the Cecils
Wait a few years and then publish
them

Jonson looks stricken

JONSON
I am not worthy of this charge my
lord I I betrayed you I told
them of your--

OXFORD

I have made it my life to know the
character of men Jonson I know you
You may have betrayed me but you will
never betray my words

He puts the last manuscript on the pile

Jonson looks at the--

pg 137
FRONT PAGE

Which reads DEDICATION then more words starting
with

To the Earl of Southampton

158 INT OXFORD STONE - OUTSIDE OXFORDS BEDROOM - DUSK

Jonson leaves Oxfords room visibly shaken The
manuscripts are under his arm

Anne Oxfords wife is still there surround by
doctors

Then she sees Jonson leaving

ANNE
Get out You your friends your
blasphemous theaters have brought
nothing but ruin and dishonor to this
family

JONSON
Ruin Dishonor Madam You your
family me even Elizabeth herself
shall be remembered solely because we
had the honor to live whilst your
husband put ink to paper

He turns and exits

CUT TO

159 EXT OXFORD STONE - DUSK

Jonson exits the building and walks away He reads the
dedication on the first page of the manuscript as he
walks

JONSON (VO)
To the Earl of Southampton The love
I dedicate to your lordship is without
end whereof this pamphlet without
beginning is but a superfluous
moiety
Jonson freezes and looks back at Oxfords house
realizing there is another whole layer to all this
exactly what he can only guess

CUT TO

pg 138
160 INT OXFORD STONE - OXFORDS ROOM - NIGHT 160
A few hours later Oxford has died in his bed Anne
watches as a doctor covers his face with a sheet
JONSON (VO)
What I have done is yours what I have
to do is yours being part in all I
have devoted yours
161 EXT A SMALL CHURCH - DAY 161
A casket is being interred into the family mausoleum
Anne is there as are Oxfords children So is Robert
Cecil
JONSON (VO)
Were my worth greater my duty would
show greater meantime as it is it
is bound to your lordship to whom I
wish long life still lengthened
with all happiness
Southampton is there as well Watching Tears roll
down his cheeks
CUT TO
162 INT TOWER OF LONDON - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT 162

Where we began

A bucket of water is DUMPED on Jonson He regains
consciousness and looks around Somewhat confused he
sees

Robert Cecil limping out of the dark towards him
Robert Cecil leans down and very close to his ear
whispers

CECIL
I can make all this go away Jonson
To be but a dream Like one of your
plays Or I can bring you so much
pain-- pain that were you given a
thousand years and a thousand quills
you could never justly describe

Cecil steps back

pg 139

CECIL (CONTD)
I know you have them All his
manuscripts My sister saw you leave
Oxford Stone with them under your arm

Jonson takes a long time before answering Will he
betray Oxford

JONSON
They were destroyed burned by
your own men

Cecil doesnt know whether to believe him or not

INTERROGATOR
Hes lying

JONSON
My lord Why would I lie Is there a
man alive who has reason to hate him
more than I

Jonson stares directly at Cecil knowing he is speaking
about Cecil as well as himself

JONSON (CONTD)
He was something I could never be An
undeniable perfection that plagued
my soul And to him I was
nothing A messenger Nothing more

Cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment searching
for the truth Then he smiles

CECIL
Let him go He tells the truth

Robert Cecil turns to leave but then turns a last

time

CECIL (CONTD)
And Jonson-- better him wont you
Wipe his memory for all time For
you And for me

Robert Cecil smiles at Jonson who can only stare at

him

Finally

JONSON
(sotto)
I am afraid that this is not possible
my lord

Robert Cecils smile freezes and he leaves

Pg-
EXT STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON - DAWN
Jonson is getting released He walks awaya lonely
figure
EXT THE ROSE THEATER - DAWN
Wide from aboveStill smoking from the fireAll

the sudden we make out Jonson searching through the
rubble

INT WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - NIGHT

Set for a Court performance of a play Courtiers bow
as King James I enters the chamber Robert Cecil two
steps behind him James takes his seat right in front
of the stage as Elizabeth used to

EXT THE ROSE THEATER - DAWN

Jonsons eyes search the ground And eventually he
finds it--

THE METAL BOX

that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration
JONSON

opens the box

INSIDE THE BOX

Are the manuscripts Oxford gave him Jonson smiles
relieved They are singed at the edges but they are

there We hear--

PROLOGUE (0S)

O-- for a muse of fire that would
ascend the brightest heaven of
invention

DISSOLVE TO

AN ACTOR

playing Prologue He is the same actor who introduced
the play at the beginning of the film But now he
wears Elizabethan clothing-- but again all
monochromatic and grey

pg 141

PROLOGUE (CONTD)
A kingdom for a stage princes to act
and monarchs to behold the swelling
scene

165 INT WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - NIGHT 165
And he is standing on the stage
PROLOGUE
Let us ciphers to this great accompt

on your imaginary forces work

King James watches enthusiastically Robert Cecil

right next to him

JAMES I
We had seen some of this Shakespeares
plays in Edinburgh Sir Robert I
must tell you we enjoyed them
immensely and look forward to seeing
many more now that we are in
London I presume you are as avid a
theater man as myself

Robert Cecils smile remains frozen

ROBERT CECIL
Of course your majesty

The CAMERA moves away from them and we realize we are
on the theater stage where we started

INT BROADWAY THEATER - STAGE - DUSK

Prologue turns and addresses his audience (and us)
the modern theater

PROLOGUE
Robert Cecil remained the most powerful
man in the Court of King James though he
could not prevent the public theaters
from becoming ever more popular William
Shakespeare however spent the remaining
years of his life not in the playhouses
of London but in the small town of his
birth Stratford upon Avon as a
businessman and grain merchant

PROLOGUE (CONTD)

Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire to be
the most celebrated playwright of his
time becoming Englands first Poet
Laureate And in 1623 he wrote the
dedication to the collected works of the
man we call William Shakespeare

And so though our story is finished

in

our poets is not For his monument is
ever-living made not of stone but of
verse and it shall be remembered as
long as words are made of breath and
breath of life

The curtains close
