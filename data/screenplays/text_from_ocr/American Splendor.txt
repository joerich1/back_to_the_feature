The room is dark A perfectly square mirror hangs
a wall
Suddenly out of the darkness the reflection of a
face comes into focus He stares straight ahead
studying his own unrecognizable reflection Its quite
this is a portrait of sickness the mans pallor is
his eyes are confused There is something most
wrong
Tentatively the figure steps away from the mirror
the frame empty and dark
ANGLE ON BED

staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce) In the eerie
hes almost translucent

The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of
caped-crusader BATMAN Batman turns toward his loyal
ROBIN who clutches a plastic trick-or-treat pumpkin
Next we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to
doorbell The camera finally rests on the last boy an
KID wearing no costume at all Looking irritated and
from the rest of the group the KID shoves his hands in

pockets of his shearling coat

He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door
The brick home is as working class as it gets The lady
the door is a 1950s HOUSEWIFE

knitted brows and wild eyes Yet there is something
vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick

though he may murder the next person who walks by

INTERTITLE BACK TO 1975
As the pencil adds shading to Harveys face WE HEAR

REAL HARVEY (VO)
Once he came to visit when I was
really feelin bad It was right
around the time of my throat
operation an right after my second
wife left me At first it was pretty
weird I mean here my life was
falling apart an everything was
going great for him I was on my
second divorce an he was a big hit
with the chicks I was a nothin
file clerk and he was this famous
cartoonist

HARVEY and R CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a

sketches

Harveys voice is still raspy

how bad experiences can cause ya
tgrow an all that clichÃ©d stuff
Ive had enough bad experiences and
growth to last me plenty

A bleary-eyed HARVEY still clad in an undershirt and
dozes off over a bowl of Corn Flakes On the table next

some spilled milk are a stack of papers covered with
scribbling He clearly has been slaving over this work

night

ANGLE ON PAPERS

At the top is a quickly scribbled title Standing

Old Jewish Ladies In Supermarket Lines These are ad
versions of a comic book The pages are divided like a

tack-toe board Each square is filled with crude stick
drawings and lots of writing
An alarm clock goes off Harveys eyes fly open

peruses

them proud of his work He gets up and looks out the

The following scene is shot through the restaurant

We see reflections of people walking by

A tense HARVEY starts at CRUMB as he eats a burger and
Harveys mock-ups Harvey doesnt touch his burger

and nervously talks in his laryngitis-afflicted voice

HARVEY
See ever since I read your stuff
man Ive been thinking I could write
comic book stories that were different
from anything being done

CRUMB
(munching on a fry)
Uh-huh

HARVEY
Im thinkin the guys who do animal
comics and super-hero stuff are really
limited cause they gotta try to
appeal to kids And underground comics
like yours have been really subversive
or opened things up politically But
there is still plenty more ta be
done with em too yknow

CRUMB
Pass me the ketchup

HARVEY
I mean with pictures and words it
could be more of an art form Like
those French movies are Or De Sica
over in Italy yknow So I tried
writin some things about real life
Stuff the everymans gotta deal with

Crumb finally looks up from Harveys work

CRUMB
These are about you

HARVEY

GONE

CRUMB
You turned yourself into a comic
hero

HARVEY

Sorta yeah But no idealized shit
No phony bullshit The real thing
yknow Ordinary life is pretty
complex stuff

Crumb reads more Harvey waits anxiously Finally Crumb

to chuckle

CRUMB
These are really good Harv

HARVEY
(insecure)
Really Ya think so

Crumb shuffles through more

CRUMB
Yeah This is great stuff man I
dig it Can I take them home and
illustrate them

Harvey is practically bursting

HARVEY
Wow

Harveys voice breaks like a kid in puberty He clears
throat And something miraculous happens

When Harvey opens his mouth to speak his LARYNGITIS IS

HARVEY
Youd do that for me man Thatd be
great I cant draw a straight line

CRUMB
Hey whats up with your voice Harv
All of a sudden it sounds fine

HARVEY

me

He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window
finding
TOBY eating lunch alone He has an entire White Castle
smorgasbord spread across the front seat
Harvey knocks on the window Toby rolls it down

Castle hamburgers so please dont

Harvey

HARVEY
Yeah We met last week

Harvey opens the car door and slides in with Toby

HARVEY
Toby what movie could possibly be
worth drivin 260 miles round trip
for

TOBY
Its a new film called Revenge of
the Nerds Its about a group of
nerd college students who are being
picked on all the time by the jocks
so they decide to take revenge I
already saw it once

HARVEY
Wow ya really dig this movie

TOBY
I like it a lot Harvey

HARVEY
What are these nerds like How would
you describe them

TOBY
Hmm Nerds are smart but they look
and act differently than other people
Like nerds might wear polyester button-
down shirts and flood pants where
their ankles and their socks are
showing
Toby spills some catsup on his polyester button-down
shirt

He stands up to get a napkin revealing his flood
pants

HARVEY
So what yer sayin is you identify
with those nerds

TOBY

(rubbing out the catsup)
Yes I consider myself a nerd And
this movie has uplifted me Theres
this one scene where a nerd grabs
the microphone during a pep rally
and announces that he is a nerd and
that he is proud of it and stands up
for the rights of other nerds Then
he asks the kids at the pep rally
who think they are nerds to come
forward So nearly everyone in the
place does Thats the way the movie
ends

HARVEY
So the nerds won huh

TOBY
(smiling)
Yes

Harvey grabs the rest of Tobys fries and opens the
door to
leave

HARVEY
Wow You got this movie an Im
gettin hitched We both had a good
month huh

heroes

Harvey scrunches his face in disbelief

HARVEY

students whose parents live in big
houses in the suburbs Theyre gonna
get degrees get good jobs and stop

Slowly the comic images and the unconscious Harvey
giving way to

GREEN SCREEN

A SURREAL DREAM SEQUENCE

We are now in a large empty room similar to a blank
book panel

A healthy fully dressed Harvey appears in the corner
frame He is very far away barely recognizable We

dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to

camera
HARVEY
My name is Harvey Pekar Its an
unusual name -- Harvey Pekar

As Harvey speaks one-dimensional comic book images
life pass over the screen once again This time in

front of
him behind him everywhere We dolly in towards him

HARVEY
1960 was the year I got my first
apartment and my first telephone
book Imagine my surprise when I
looked up my name and saw that in
addition to me another Harvey Pekar
was listed

Images of Harveys childhood float by followed by his

young
adult years

HARVEY
I was listed as Harvey L Pekar
My middle name is Lawrence He was
listed as Harvey Pekar -- no middle
initial Therefore his was a purer
listing

We see Harvey age in the images hes hanging on the
street

corner with friends collecting records hanging with
Crumb

HARVEY
Then in the seventies I noticed
that a third Harvey Pekar was listed
in the phone book This filled me
with curiosity

HARVEY
How could there be three people with
such an unusual name in the world
let alone in one city

Now numerous images of Harveys many years at the VA

Hospital float by Harvey filing Harvey arguing with
his

boss Harvey and Toby etc

HARVEY
Then one day a person I worked with
expressed her sympathy to me
concerning what she thought was the
death of my father She pointed out
an obituary notice in the newspaper
for a man named Harvey Pekar One of
his sons was named Harvey These
were the other Harvey Pekars

The comic images fade out Harvey is once again alone

in the
empty room
HARVEY
Six months later Harvey Pekar Jr
died Although Id met neither man
I was filled with sadness What
were they like I thought It seemed
that our lives had been linked in
some indefinable way
We slowly move in on his face Extremely close As
close as
the camera can get
HARVEY
But the story does not end there
For two years later another Harvey
Pekar appeared in the directory
What kind of people are these Where
do they come from what do they do
Whats in a name
