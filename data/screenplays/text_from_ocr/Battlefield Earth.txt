FIRST DRAFT
OCTOBER 1998

EXT BARREN MOUNTAINOUS REGION - DUSK

The sky glows deep crimson as the sun starts to sink below the
horizon casting shadows over

A small group of native people clad in animal skins congregat
outside a remote cave Their heads reverently bowed while-

PARSON STAFFER
And the monsters descended from the sky
raising a great cloud of dust killing
all men but for a very few

His gaze sweeps across the youngsters drilling into their heads

PARSON STAFFER (contd)
As survivors we must dedicate our lives
to pleasing the gods so they may return
and drive away the monsters

Turns a sharp eye back to Jonnie but still addressing the child

PARSON STAFFER (contd)
“nd arrogance does not please the gods

Bis rugged frame clothed in a puma hide a kill-club hanging fron
his belt And although only nineteen JONNIE already has the
look of someone who has already overcome a lifetimes worth of
adversity He immediatelv turns to Chrissv

PARSON STAFFER
Finishes chanting up to the heavens

PARSON STAFFER
-May you chase away the monsters and
tead «us back to the lands of plenty

The clan closes their eyes in silent prayer All except for--

CBRISSY

Her teenage ccuntenance offset by the maturity in her strong dark
eyes
EXT CAVE -- A LITTLE LATER

The parson shakes his head as Jonnie secures an animal-skin sleep
roll and extra kill-clubs to his snow-white horse WINDSPLITTER

PARSCN STAFFER
This is not what your mother wanted

The parsons ancient face burns with religious fury as he drills
his stare into Jonnie

JONNIE
My mother wanted what was best for the
tribe And as long as we stay here
there will barely be enough to eat
JONNIE (contd)
While there may be other places we could
live where the food is more plentiful

PARSON STAFFER
It is true that food is scarce and
everyone appreciates your desire to help
but I cant help wonder if there isnt
‘more to why you want to go out there

Be lets that hang there then gives Jonnie a pointed look-

PARSON STAFFER (contd)
But all it would take is for one monster
to see you and follow you back and we
would all be struck down

Jonnie meets his rage with calu determination

JONNIE
Have you ever seen a monster

He turns to the rest of the clan challenging--

JONNIE (contd)
Bas anyone here ever seen a monster

And if he has any doubt in his voice Jonnie does a good job of
hiding it He hops onto Windsplitter and takes off--

EXT OTHER SIDE OF THE RAVINE -- CONTINUOUS

Jonnie heads down the hill turning a bend where--

CHRISSY

Sits waiting for him on her horse which like Windsplitter is
loaded with an animal-skin sleeping roll and kill-clubs

Jonnie smiles impressed by Chrissys mettle But shakes his
head
JONNIE
(finishing his thought)
--I think you can handle yourself better
than most men Which is why you must

stay and look after your younger
brothers

Chrissy looks at him chagrined Its hard to argue with that
A tough beat Nothing left but to say good-bye

And finally struggling to keep her face a mask Chrissy removes
a shiny MEDALLION hanging from her neck

CHRISSY

This was given to me by my father when he
died He received it from his father

(trying to hold

back the emotions)
Im not giving it to you Im lending
it So you better not let anything
happen to you out there

The young ones obediently stop at the bridge They will not

She places the medallion around his neck their bodies close if
not touching So much not being said

The tribes children race alongside Jonnie excited by the
adventure hes going on But secretly terrified by the death
theyve been taught awaits him

cross it But Jonnie does leaving thetribe behind
Chrissys mask starting o crack as she watches him disappear
The first of the tears escaping down her cheeks

EXT VALLEY -- DUSK

As night falls Jonnie rides across wide open plains His eye
tense searching the gathering darkness for the first sign of

And he suddenly freezes Seeing his first ever

STAR

Hovering majestically overhead Soon joined by other stars
Jonnie stares up in wonderment at these heavenly lights i

EXT PRAIRIE -- SEVERAL DAYS LATER

Jonnie steals through the grass throwing his kill-club with
blurring speed at an unsuspecting ANTELOPE

EXT FOREST - DAYS LATER

Jonnie rides through a grove of conifer trees the strips of

dried meat now hanging from his sleeping roll when he sudden
i i and silently dismounts--

Careful not to make the slightest sound Jonnie slips behind ¢

ROCK FORMATION

Pulling his kill-club Jonnie carefully peers out through a th
tangle of brush

EXT TOWN — DAY

Jonnie and Windsplitter move through a deserted housing develo
passing TREES which grow up through the sidewalks and streets

A faded piece of PAPER flutters by Jonnie picks it up

He can just make out a picture of a woman in a bra The first
time Jonnie has seen a photo let alone womens undergarments

More paper litters the ground nearby Jonnie heads to them
passing a rusted TRAIN abandoned on its tracks

Windsplitter abruptly stops Nostrils flaring Eyes on a HOUS
The door knocked off its hinges Windows shattered Jonnie
pulls his kill-club and silently shoos Windsplitter away

FKill-club at the ready Jonnie cautiously approaches the house
when suddenly--
A GRIZZLY BEAR
Rockets out the front door barreling after--

Jonnie who bolts away desperately trying to outrun his de
pursuer Seeking higher ground Jonnie races to the--

Train and scrambles up the side of a rail car then Spins

EXT RAIL CAR ROOF -- CONTINUOUS

The grizzly has stopped chasing him and turns back to her Ct
who scamper out of the house to play in the front yard

MALE VOICE (0S)
Good thing she already had her lunch--

Jonnie whirls around with club raised Coming face to face
TWO MEN

The one doing the talking CARLO is wiry and intense-lookin
In contrast to his ‘built-like-a-brick-shithouse companion
well call ROCK for obvious reasons

But the thing Jonnie probably notices first about the men ari
SPEARS they both have aimed at his chest ste oe

Carlo motions to the kill-club in Jonnies hand

CARLO (contd)
We mean you no harm if you mean us no

Jonnie slowly lowers his weapon but remains on guard
Rock silently directs his partners attention to--

WINDSPLITTER

Who grazes near the train waiting for Jonnie Both men tak
note of the antelope-meat Windsplitter carries

Carlo turns a friendly eye back to Jonnie
CARLO
You have been fortunate in the hunt
You should thank the gods

JONNIE
If I ever see one I will

EXT GROUND -- NEXT TO THE TRAIN -- MOMENTS LATER

Jonnie hands strips of dried meat to Carlo and Rock who
reverently bow their heads holding the food up to the heaven

CARLO
The monsters like to hunt in the dark
We better find shelter
)

EXT SHOPPING MALL A LITTLE LATER
The snow really coming down now Windsplitter follows our trio
through a white carpeted parking lot taking shelter inside a--
INT SHOPPING MALL -- CONTINUOUS
A brightly decorated plastic CHRISTMAS TREE stands among the rea
trees growing up through the floor A CD of SILENT NIGHT loops
endlessly from the few speakers in the mall that still work
INT DEPARTMENT STORE -- SECOND FLOOR -- A LITTLE LATER
Our trio head into a department store but Carlo and Rock freeze
their tracks with sickened expressions
CARLO

«Whatever those poor bastards did

they must have really angered the gods
Rock silently nods appalled by the sight of--

MANNEQUINS lying broken on the floor Many of these ‘frozen
people missing limbs not to mention their genitalia Nearby

Jonnie stands curious in front of a large plate-glass window tl
makes up an entire wall Outside he can see the snow falling
when he tries to touch it an ‘invisible force keeps stopping h

KABLAM 4

In a sudden flash of light Carlo is hurled back off his feet
His body crashes hard to the ground twitches once then falls
deadly still

And out of the shadows behind Rock steps a truly nightmarish
figure Like the parsons drawing of the monster but worse

Over nine feet tall with glowing amber eyes Razor sharp talons
on his claws Thick bone-like structures for eyebrows and lips
The PSYCHLO aims his BLAST-GUN dead center on Rock and fires--
As Jonnies KILL-CLUB flies through the air--

Knocking into the firing weapon causing the shot to go wide
Jonnie and Rock take off through the store bolting through a
maze of aisles which lead them through a-doorway--

INT STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS

Our guys sprint up the stairs The sound of deadly pursuit
getting louder behind them as they burst out onto--

EXT ROOF -- CONTINUOUS

The only way off the two-story building is to jump And the
frozen ground below doesnt make this too appealing an option
Nee

(

i the Psychlo rushing through the doorway behind them
Jonnie and Rock throw themselves off the side of the building--

EXT SNOW COVERED GROUND -- CONTINUOUS

Jonnie hits the ground rolling to his feet--

Rock isnt as fortunate and lands at a bad angle SNAPPING his
on impact He tries to climb to his feet but the broken leg
buckles sending him collapsing back «o the snow

Jonnie turns back to help him--

He gives a loud whistle and

EXT SHOPPING MALL -- CONTINUOUS

Windsplitter gallops out of the mall

‘Hooves churning up a fl
of snow as he races to Jonnie--

The Psychlo pauses to look down at

- ROCK who trembles in terror Pleading to the stars overhead--

ROCK

---Help me please ‘I have lived ac
devoted life

But the twinkling lights seem indifferent to his plight

Jonnie watches helplessly as the Psychlo slams down a lever on
the side of the gun then aims it down at Rock KABBLAMI

A gaping hole blown through Rocks chest

vonne st
the reins

Anc then he sees nat ooKS

ike insect Thirty feet Long and
hy twelve T2ec

Fice 25 side And smoozn Sitting
tne miadie of tne wide path

Ye

curns Winaspiictter and runs for open country

Theres an earsplitting roar

vonnie giances back 70 where the thing rises three feet
apove the cround And moves ‘forward

vonnie passes one corner then another The thing falling -
behind

He swerves Windsplitter up a sidestreet reaches another

corner and again turnes He heads for the open country
He can hear the roaring of the thing somewhere beyond the
rubble He listens holding his breath The position of the
roar changing Shifting to the right

The thing somehow blocks the street ahead of him and then
goes on planning to come up behind him

He is trapped There is no panic in him now He slows the
hard pounding of his heart The thing to do is wait until the
monster is right in the street behind him-then go over that
barricade a fallen building had become

He sidles Windsplitter back to get a good run”

The thing is roaring down the side path behind him Now it is
turning He glances back There it is wisps of smoke coming
out of its nostrils

Jonnie put the heel to Windsplitter He yanks on the lead
rope

And sprints at the barricade Rough and full of loose stones
Dangerous my

Up they scramble Rubble slides But up they go All the way
to the top One glance back shows

the thing rolling up to the very bottom of the barricade

But hes over the barricade He hits he street before him at
a run and keeps running

Jonnie swerves chrougn cneckerooard of paths edging to the
open country

Purther and further The buildings thinning Open country
between two structures to his right He skids down off the
embankment and races for freedom Windsplitter puffing

He strains his eyes watching

There it is

It slides out from among the buildings and starts straight
toward him
And suddenly theres a SHEET OF FLAME Ahead of him ene
right-hand building explodes apart Its top slides slowly h
down and into the street anead blocking it Spattered wit

dust Jonnie hauls up short
He puts the horse p to a run
The thing not only closes the distance but starts to pass

Jonnie swerves at right angies

The thing banks into a turn and flashes by him well ahead
turns and blocks his way

Jonnie pulls up He turns around and began to run away from
it

It let out a blasting roar scorches by him and again stops
blocking his way

Jonnie’s face tightens into determination

Thong solid on his wrist

Walking Windsplitter he moves up ahead of the thing It
doesntmove He goes about a hundred feetin front of the
thing It doesnt move He carefully spots the position of a
slitted eye

And whirls the kill club And puts 4 heel to Windsplitter
They race straight at the thing

The kill club carried with the full speed of the running
horse whooshes down straight at the slitted eye

The crash of impact is deafening

Jonnie slows beyond the thing It had not moved

He trots Windsplitter back to the original position a
hundred feet in front of the thing He turns and makes ready
for a second run

He touches a heel Windspiizter piunaes forward

And then a great gout of yeliow blooms out from between the
eyes

Jonnie is struck a blow like all the winds of Highpeak rolled
into one

Windsplitter catches the full force of it Up into the air go
horse and rider Down they come with a shuddering crash
against the earth

2INTEE DARKNESS

Theres an ethereal almost otherworldly WAILING Then a stab of
light and--

EXT ABOVE THE MALL -- DAWN

The shopping mall falls away below as we rise higher and higher
above it Like a soul returning to heaven

But for some reason were looking down through prison-like BARS
REVERSE ANGLE TO

Jonnies face as he starts to come to Disorientated he looks
around A handful of men stare back at him each one trying to
hide how terrified they are And PULLING BACK we can see
Jonnie and the men are imprisoned in a cargo cage suspended from
the underbelly of a--

EXT PSYCHLO AERIAL TRANSPORT VEHICLE

Which climbs up vertically into the sky with engines wailing

then rockets forward with impressive speed

INT CARGO CAGE -- CONTINUOUS

An icy wind blasts through the cage But the cold is the least c
Jonnies concern as he spots Carlo lying motionless in the cornez

A pair of young scrappy-looking twins MICKEY and SAMMY give Jc
a reassuring look They shout to be heard over the howling wind-

MICKEY
If the monsters fire-stick doesnt
make a hole in you you go to sleep

SAMMY
But you wake-up-

And sure enough Carlo groggily begins to stir Relieved to see
Jonnie But then he looks around for Rock

INT COCKPIT -- AERIAL TRANSPORT VEHICLE -- LATER THAT DAY

The Psychlo banks the transport vehicle around a mountain
revealing a massive TRANSPARENT DOME covering a large city below

Getting closer we can see Mile High Stadium And behind it the
distinctive design of Denver International Airport
EXT DOME -- A LITTLE LATER

The vehicle hovers down and with the sound of a magnetic field
disengaging deposits the cage into the back of a flatbed truck
i)

JONNIE 7

INT CARGO CAGE -- MOMENTS LATER

The Psychlo lumbers in with box-shaped AIR-FILTRATION UNITS eact
with a thin tube attached to it He starts to slide one of these
tubes into Jonnies nose but Jonnie knocks the creatures paw at

The Psychlo growls hurling Jonnie viciously across the cage--

Slams into the bars sliding down to the floor where the Psychlc
unceremoniously jams the tube up Jonnies nose

EXT DOME -- A LITTLE LATER

The Psychlo drives the flatbedtransport truck with the cargo cag
it through an ENTRY PORT complete with mammoth air-lock chambers
Jonnie studies everything with the trained eye of a skilled hunte

INT DOME -- CONTINUOUS
The dome covering Denver is so enormous it has its own weather

And right now a dark drizzle falls onto the city which looks
much like it does today save for two things

A grimy layer of mining soot covers the place And for some
reason most of the buildings have been painted purple

INT TRUCK -- DRIVERS CABIN -- CONTINUOUS

The Psychlo removes the tube from his own nose and leans out the
window taking a deep contented breath

INT CARGO CAGE -- BACK OF THE TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS

Jonnie experiments with removing his own tube But he immediatel
has trouble breathing Eyes going glassy He replaces the tube a
fast as he can Carlo gives him a pointed look

EXT DENVER STREET -- A LITTLE LATER

The sounds of HEAVY INDUSTRY fill the air as the truck turns down
street passing a shift of PSYCHLO LABORERS trudging off with lunc
pails to go work in the mines and smelting plants

INT WAREHOUSE COMPLEX-- A LITTLE LATER

The Psychlo backs the truck up to a loading dock and HONKS
Several GUARDS head over with a PROCESSING CLERK as the Psychlo
“Human-Slave Wrangler swings open the cargo cage

And now we can see that while this Psychlo is an imposing figure
at nine feet tall hes actually a bit of a runt The other
Psychlos are all a good foot or two taller

Including the clerk who takes one look at Jonnie and the others
and drills a hard stare into the undersized Psychlo wrangler
PSYCHLO CLERK
Youre gone three days and you only
caught six of them

INT CARGO CAGE -- CONTINUOUS
Jonnie studies the monsters closely but from his P0V allt

hears is an unintelligible machine-like clicking sound of theiz
alien language He turns a questioning eye to Carlo

INT CARGO CAGE -- CONTINUOUS

And even though Jonnie doesnt know what the Psychlos are arguir
about he knows one thing Theyre not paying him any attentior
So he moves like a streak out the cage door Carlo right behinc

INT WAREHOUSE COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS

But the wrangler isnt about to lose any more of his ‘cargo anc
whirls snatching Jonnie then lunges for Carlo--

But Carlo manages to twist out of reach of the creatures talons
sprint away through the warehouse The wrangler pulls his gun

PSYCHLO CLERK
Dont kill it We cant use it if its
dead--

The wrangler gives him a snide How stupid do you think I am
look Jonnie watches from the ground as--

The Psychlo slides a lever above the blast-guns trigger-guard
into an up position then takes aim and FIRES--

Carlo is knocked flat as the blue-bolt slams into him His body
lies motionless but intact on the ground

The Psychlo holsters his fire-arm and scoops up Jonnie Starts
to toss him back into the caqe but--

s

Jonnie has the weapon And is pointing it straight at him The
wrangler sniggers The same reaction from the other Psychlos

Its like a ‘horse’ has somehow picked up a gun with its hooves
Only Jonnie slides the weapons lever into the down-position

The wrangler is no longer laughing He reaches down coaxing
Jonnie as if he was some kind of errant pet

PSTCBLO WRANGLER
Come on boy Give me the gun

But Jonnie doesnt So the wrangler lunges for it--

BABLAM
The Psychlo Wrangler stares stunned at the--
FIST-SIZED HOLE

Blown through his chest He collapses dead before he hits the
ground The other Psychlos freeze in stunned silence Then

Burst out in hysterical laughter That has got to be the goddam
funniest thing theyve ever seen

With the monsters busy laughing Jonnie makes a break for it
Charging through the warehouse complex and out a doorway--
EXT STREET -- OUTSIDE WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

Where he barrels straight into--

TERL

Who unlike the Psychlo laborers wears a senior officers unifor
adorned with impressive gold epaulets denoting Chief of Securi

His ever present assistant KER cant help but snicker at the m
collision has splattered over his bosss perfectly pressed attir

But Terl doesnt seem to find it amusing He shuts Ker up with
quick look then rips Jonnie off his feet-

INT WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Holding the filthy ‘man-animal out at arms length Terl marche

inside the warehouse demanding to ‘know--

TERL
Who is responsible for allowing this
Man-animal to run around unsupervised

The clerk immediately points to the dead wrangler
CLERK
The man-animal shot the wrangler and--

TERL
w-Im a little pressed for time Save
the ‘going-away jokes for later

CLERK
No joke sir I swear The man-
animal somehow got his gun And when he
reached for it the man-animal shot him

The other Psychlos nod backing this up Terl considers this
then picks the blaster—gun up from the ground ‘

And calmly hands the weapon to Jonnie

TERL
(to the clerk)
Show me

OC) CLERK

--Sir

TERL
Reach for the gun

CLERK
But sir It might shoot me

TERL
Sure It might And I ‘might’
suddenly grow a third arm ce ee ee

CLERK
But I swear sir it shot--

Rapidly losing patience Terl snaps--

TERL
-Any reports filed today still have
my name on it And youre out of your
skull if you think Im going to write
Shot By Man-Animal as the cause of
death in the Security Field Report
unless I see it with my own eyes
F (end of discussion) -
Ce This isnt a request its an order

Knowing hes treading on dangerous ground the clerk stares at Te
CLERK

-eBut with all respect sir if I
follow that order I may get killed

Terl returns his stare without blinking
TERL
The regulations are quite clear
(dead serious)

If you refuse to obey the order its a

certainty that you will be killed
The clerk swallows hard then turns to Jonnie and
Lunges for the gun trying to grab it before--
KABLAM
Jonnie blasts a hole through the clerks chest

Terl stares in disbelief But Jonnies not finished A bigger
Psychlo leaps up and charges Roaring

Jonnie stumbles backward
An enormous paw blurs in the air coming at him Talons rake
the side of his face

Jonnie has the gun in position and fires at the huge chest
He punches blast after blast into it driving him back

Terl jerks the gun from Jonnies hands and sends a swipe
across his chest that sends him crumbling to the ground

TERL

---Well Ill te camned
INT EMPLOYEE RECREATION BALL -- A LITTLE LATER

A lively joint wher2 a bunch of Psychlo laborers let off steam
playing LASER-BASH Others consume libations while slapping and
pinching the asses of the female Psychlo wait-staff who pass by

Terl plops onto a stool at the bar but before he can order hes
served a saucepan full of KERBANGO a thick oily beverage

BARTENDER “
When the best security chief this planet
ever had is leaving the least I can do
js buy him a pan of kerbango on the
house

Terls eyes slit in suspicion The bartender shrugs keeping his
voice casual as he continues

BARTENDER (contd)
And of course Im sure our little
agreement is still in effect
(making sure)
Now that youre leaving that little
unfortunate incident wont somehow
‘magically’ appear in my file

Terl helps himself to a shot of kerbango then explains--

TERL (contd)
As long as you provided me useful
information I wouldnt file the report
(matter-of-fact)
But now that Im leaving this pitiful
excuse for a planet you will no longer
be providing me with useful information
fhe color drains from the bartenders face Terl strolls off
chuckling quite pleased with how fun that was

INT INDIGENOUS LABOR PROCESSING CENTER -- CONTINUOUS

A PSYCHLO TECHNICIAN wearing rubber gloves and a germ mask over
face uses laser-scissors to cut the animal skins off of Jonnie

The skins get tossed into an INCINERATOR The technician then
reaches over and yanks Chrissys medallion from Jonnies neck

Jonnie tries to grab it back but the technician swats him away
like he was an insect then holds up the object to see what was
so damn important to the nan-animal
And we can now see Chrissys ‘shiny’ medallion is a SILVER DOLLA
PSYCELO TECHNICIAN

Anyone want this primitive little

trinket
Nobody does So the technician tosses it into the incinerator
As Jonnie watches Chrissys medallion get consumed by the flames
something deep and dangerous burns in his eyes
EXT DENVER MINING SITE -- CONTINUOUS
A long line of humans chained to stakes like leashed dogs hunc

a massive conveyor belt spewing out a constant discharge of crus
rocks The humans separate out the OAR which they place into--

‘ Psychlo-sized BASKETS which wouldnt be too difficult for a

Psychlo to carry but its back-breaking work for the humans
hauling them across a large field to a

EXT TELEPORTATION PLATFORM

Psychlo Guards use rod-like devices to prod the slower slaves al
with sinister blasts of raw electricity

A GROOND CART

Glides by with Ker at the wheel

Terl is in the rear gazing at the humans with the indifference
someone might have driving past a dairy farm full of cows

EXT TELEPORTATION PLATFORM -- THAT DAY

With the platform loaded with baskets of ore an ALARM sounds an
the Psychlos immediately don protective goggles and ear-plugs

The humans have no such gear to protect them as

The HUM of large generators starts to fill the air Growing
louder as they work-up to full power and theres suddenly--

An EAR-SPLITTING explosion of sound and BLINDING FLASH of light
as all the baskets of ore on the platform vanish
A brief moment of quiet respite Then the deafening roar and
blazing light happens again And this time

a EXT TELEPORTATION PLATFORM -- MOMENTS LATER

Hundreds of PSYCHLO LABORERS suddenly appear on the platform
along with--

DISTRICT MANAGER ZETE

Who wears the finest of silk suits and carries a solid gold
briefcase Terl and Ker quickly greet him

TERL
Welcome your Excellency As this
planets senior security officer it
would be my pleasure to expedite your
on-planet clearance through security--

But the District Manager isnt listening Hes staring confused
through the transparent dome at the snow-capped Rocky mountains

DISTRICT MANAGER
Does all of Earth look like this

--eIm afraid so

DISTRICT MANAGER
I was told this planet was ugly

O

He peers up at a fluffy cloud drifting across a clear blue sky

DISTRICT MANAGER (contd)
But its got to be the ugliest crap-hole
in the entire universe

TERL
I couldnt agree more sir Now if
youll please follow me

He finally manages to get the District Manager through security
then seizes the opportunity to introduce Ker

TERL (contd)
This is Executive-Assistant Ker Hes
been fully trained to take-over as
Security Chief so therell be no
disruptions with my transfer--

He takes one last sickened look at the humans declaring--

DISTRICT MANAGER

Z Well be doing the universe a favor by
exterminating the whole lot of them

once we finish mining-out their

miserable little planet

INT INDIGENOUS LABOR IDENTIFICATION STATION -- CONTINUOUS

A pair of Psychlo guards hold Jonnie down on a steel table as an
IDENTIFICATION TECHNICIAN presses a--

SEARING-HOT IRON

Into Jonnies arm branding him with an ID number Jonnie stares
the technician in the eye refusing to acknowledge the pain

Amused the technician digs the burning iron harder into Jonnies
flesh Jonnies eyes bulge but he remains steely silent

The guards release Jonnie and shove him toward the next station
then turn and grab the next human slave in line which is-

MICKEY The guards drag the young twin kicking and screaming t
the branding table and pin him down as the technician lowers the
iron toward the trembling youngsters exposed flesh--

Only the iron is no longer in his hands

Wielding it like a weapon Jonnie knocks the stunned guards away
from Mickey then pivots with blurring speed--

- Smee’ feoians c

JONNIE
How Do You Like It--

As the technician howls in pain a mass of guards swarm Jonnie
viciously clubbing him to the ground

The obese PLANETSHIP waddles over flanked by his smarmy-looking
ASSISTANT They shake paws with the District Manager then lead
him across the lobby Terl and Ker follow

DISTRICT MANAGER
-How do you stand it

He motions out a window at a tree-filled park

DISTRICT MANAGER (contd)

planets indigenous power-generation
systems That way we didnt have to
build our own It was actually my idea

(basks in the glory of)

And unless Im mistaken my idea has
already saved the corporation well over
six-hundred thousand credits--

DISTRICT MANAGER
--Im afraid youre mistaken

ASSISTANT PLANETSHIP
« -Sir

DISTRICT MANAGER

The Assistant Planetship crushed manages a polite nod Terl
suppresses a smile He likes the District Managers style

INT INDIGENOUS LABOR PROCESSING CENTER -- CONTINUOUS

Jonnie bloody and bruised but alive hobbles down a steel
hallway with the other now branded slaves when--

The Psychlos open up with HIGH POWERED HOSES

A solid stream of water savagely blasts into the defenseless
humans as the Psychlos hose down the dirty man-animals

INT BASEMENT -- LATER THAT DAY

Terl and the other Psychlo executives sits around a conference té
in a windowless dungeon of a room which has been painted purple

DISTRICT MANAGER
«-I will approve additional labor
resources be sent here by end of the
quarter-cycle And I believe that does
it except for your long overdue
transfer

He turns and offers Terl a friendly smile
DISTRICT MANAGER (contd)

off this disgusting excuse of a planet

TERL
I just want to serve the corporation in
whatever way they deem best sir
DISTRICT MANAGER
very admirable And youve done a first-
rate job here as interim security chief

TERL
(modestly)
Thank you sir Ive done my best--

DISTRICT MANAGER
--Weve decided to keep you here for

With endless options for renewal The
options of course being at Home

Terl reacts like he was just given a death sentence The
District Manager leans forward giving him a knowing look--

DISTRICT MANAGER (contd)
The senator has a lot of friends

EXT MINING SITE -- A LITTLE LATER

Jonnie Carlo and the rest of the new ‘abductees’ are issued
baskets and shoved into line with the rest of the slaves

Concerned by his friends battered condition Carlo admonishes
Theres no point in trying to fight

Ker chauffeurs at the wheel In the back seat Terl lowers his
voice so only the District Manager can hear

TERL
-Would you please explain to the
senator that if I even had an ipkling it

DISTRICT MANAGER
--The senators exact words to me were
and Im quoting “If that blasted Terl
tries to talk his way out of it have
him vaporized on the spot

Leaving Terl with that thought the District Manager strides up
the platform relieved to be leaving this crappy little planet
INT EMPLOYEE RECREATION HALL -- A LITTLE LATER

The place is packed and loud The newly arrived Psychlo workers
getting plastered on kerbango while losing money paw-over-fist i
laser bash and other assorted rigged games of chance‘

Terl storms up to the bar The bartender looks up surprised

BARTENDER
Youre still here

And something suddenly snaps deep inside Terl He grabs Ker
pulling him close the words coming fast and furious--

TERL
I can assure you I was not groomed
since birth to get some ‘cushy job
that even a moron like you could
perform While you were trying to
learn to spell your name I was being
trained how to conquer galaxies And
doing anything less is a disgrace to my
entire family line--

With his gang backing him up Floyd explains to Jonnie--
OO)

FLOYD
After were done if theres any food
left you can have it with the others

Given how malnourished the ‘others’ look it doesnt appear that
theres usually much food left

JONNIE
Thats how it used to work

With blinding speed Jonnie scoops up a flaming log from the
fire and before Floyd can react-- P 9 108

Jonnie SLAMS the club-like wood full-force into Floyds face
dropping him hard to the ground Only a moment later

And other than a bloody nose he shows no effect from the shot he
just took Jonnie smashes him again--

‘But this time the big brute is ready for it so all it seems to

do is just piss him off He grabs Jonnie by the throat and
begins to choke the life from him

Jonnie desperately tries to break-free but Floyd is too strong
‘He holds Jonnie out at arms length preventing Jonnie from
getting at him as he continues to brutally strangle Jonnie

And with his attacker finally close enough to reach Jonnies

hand rockets out p

Floyd staggers back struggling to breath With his eyes going g
Floyd releases Jonnie and focuses on reinserting the tube as--

Jonnie locks his hands together and swings them like a baseball
bat delivering a tremendous blow to Floyds jaw

Floyd falls to the ground And this time he stays there out for
the count Jonnie takes mercy on the big man and sticks the tube
back into his nose then heads over to the trough

But realizes everyone else is holding back respectfully letting
him eat first Jonnie shakes his head declaring--

JONNIE
Everyone eats at the same time

The men all rush the trough

The slop might be disgusting but at least its sustenance And

Ker despondently removes his picture from under the sign and
with an audible sigh hammers Terls picture back up

And PULLING BACK yet again we realize were watching this on

INT TERLS LIVING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

A lone monitor perched next to a bed where Terl opens a large--
FOOTLOCKER

All neatly packed for what should have been his return home

Terl almost looks like hes going to cry as he starts to unpack
But he suddenly stops Sensing it

His eyes instinctively going to the monitor which shows--

Ker peering out the windows making sure no one is watching
before reaching into his

DESK -

Inside the hidden false bottom of a drawer Ker pulls out of a
SURVEILLANCE PHOTO of a mountain range and

Ker dives across the room back to his own desk snatching-up a
crossword puzzle which he pretends to be working on as

Terl marches in and heads straight to his desk where he grabs
the surveillance photo Ker tries to play it cool

KER
I was wondering when you were going to
look at that It same in last week and
I put it straight in your--

TERL
If youre going to lie to me at least
have the decency to do a credible job
(dead serious)
So I dont look like a complete idiot
for having tried to train you

He sharply jabs a talon toward Kers secret hiding place Kers
face goes death-white How could Terl possibly know

But then Ker suddenly realizes His eyes probing the room as-

KER
You said we use picto-cameras to spy on
other offices But under no circumstance
do we spy on our own office
TERL
Thats right We dont
(matter-of-fact)
Z do

Start talking

Given the look in Terls eyes Ker decides his best chance is to

come clean and to do it fast--

KER
The photos from last weeks recon
drone It shows a glacier that just
split open It exposed a gold vein

Terl glances at the photo then gives Ker a knowing look

TERL-
And you were going to wait until after
I transferred to turn it in so you
could get all the credit for it
yourself

KER
(sheepish nod)
I didnt think youd mind

He regrets it the moment he said it Braces himself for the
punishment he knows must be coming But surprisingly

TERL
I dont mind Go aheadand turn it in
(hands Ker the photo)
But first pretend youre not a complete
imbecile and check the compo-gradients

Ker looks down studying a miniature row of color bars at the
very bottom of the photo His face falls as he realizes

KER
The mountains full of uranium No
Psychlo can get near it without their
breath-gas exploding
(despondent )
Theres no way to mine the gold--

A HAMMER suddenly nails Ker in the back dropping him to the fl
Terl swings again This time harder Savagely beating Ker--

TERL
--But What I Do Mind Is That You
Betrayed Me Over A Lousy Recon Photo

KER
But Its Worthless You Just Said So
Yourself

TERL
Yes But You Didnt know It Was
Worthless--

He raiases hoe hammer with lathal intent Bnd withant haatitatia

Only Ker manages to scramble out of the way at the last minute
Be grabs the hammer from Terl and scrambles to his feet--

But freezes as Terl pulls his BLAST-GUN

KER (contd)
You cant shoot me Its against
regulations Im not just some man-
animal you can kill for sport--

But Terl reaches for the trigger and Stops Staring at the
gun his mind racing

Terls eyes snap to the surveillance photo Then to a monitor
showing humans working in the mines Then back to the gun

And it suddenly connects for Terl
Ker mistakes all of this for some cruel pause before his

inevitable execution and continues to plead--

KER
Please Ill Make It Up To You I
Swear Dont Shoot Me--

Terl looks shocked by the very suggestion

TERL -
Shoot you My most trusted colleague
He holsters his gun and throws a friendly arm around Ker

TERL (contd)
Of course not Weve got work to do

Ker clearly has no idea in hell what Terls talking about but a
long as it involves not getting shot hes all for it

TERL (cond)
Tomorrow morning we have to warn the aan
Planetship about the “mutiny”

The setting sun casts a shadow over CHRISSY who sits on a rock
keeping a hopeful eye on the far side of the ravine We get the
feeling she spends a lot of time on that rock watching and wait

A WITHERED HAND grips her shoulder She turns around to face th
Parson who gives Chrissy a concerned look--

PARSON
Hes been gone over three months
(the grim reality)
If the monsters didnt get him he would
have been back by now--

Chrissy whirls back to the ravine with a relieved smile But
theres nothing there Only now we can here it

The feint sound of GALLOPING HOOFS Growing louder as--

A flash of white is now visible on the far side of the canyon
Rocketing up the incline and over the drawbridge and

Chrissys smile instantly evaporates as she realizes Windsplitter
disreturning riderless

INT DENVER SHOPPING MALL -- THE NEXT MORNING

The Planetship and his Assistant are stretched-out on CHAISE-
LOUNGES But right now the Planetship looks anything but relaxec

Across from him Terl and Ker sit ona chaise-lounge next to a
sun-lamp Terl and Ker have concerned looks on their faces

TERL
And if this worker revolt takes cee
place my informants tell me the first
order of business will be to separate
you from your head ‘

PLANETSHIP
Which is why there will be no mutiny
(panic in his voice)
Im authorizing you to use whatever
means necessary to stop it

Terl nods so far so good Then continues

TERL
Our best chance to prevent this mutiny is
to increase profits So we dont have to
keep cutting the workers pay

PLANETSHIP
Production equals profits And Im
already bringing in as many new workers
as possible to boost production

TERL
But we have to pay those new workers

The Assistant Planetship gives Terl a snide look

the Planetship waves her off keeping his attention on Terl

O

TERL (contd)
We already use them for manual labor
What if we could train them to take-on
certain additional duties Like
‘operating mining machines

(quickly adds)

That way we can boost production
without increasing expenses

The Planetship and his Assistant wait for the punch-line But
there isnt one So they roar with laughter

PLANETSHIP
Man-animals operate a machine Have
you blown a head-gasket

ASSISTANT PLANETSHIP
Its hard enough to keep them from
peeing on the carpet But mining

PLANETSHIP
Id be the laughing stock of the entire
universe

Exactly what Terl was hoping hed say

aw) TERL
Which is why you should have me take
some man-animals and equipment out to a
remote area Its better you dont know
where And Ill try to train them

(nonchalant shrug)

Have them do some test-mining That way
if it doesnt work out no one will know

PLANETSHIP
And if it does work Ill be vaporized
Its against the law to train an--

TERL
--According to Regulations Volume 989
Article 34-A Paragraph 19A
Planetship faced with a profit-
threatening situation such as a mutiny
is relieved of any and all lesser
ordinances in the pursuit of protecting
said profits

The Planetship chews on this He cant argue with the logic
But shakes his head anyway abruptly declaring--

s PLANETSHIP

We stick to the original plan Bring in
more workers and they go on half-pay as

soon as they arrive And thats final

And before anyone can say anything--

bui

The Planetship JUMPS OFF the third floor railing And nobody
seems the least bit surprised by this Probably because

The first two floors have been turned into a Psychlo-sized swimm

A cold and brutal Psychlo march song plays over loudspeakers as a

long line of exhausted and freezing humans are escorted at gun
point out to the mines In the rear of the procession

The young twins Mickey and Sammy work their way over to Jonnie

SAMMY
We hear youre planning a break-out

MICKEY
Count us in--

A Psychlo thrusts Jonnie forward with the butt of a gun keeping
him moving with the parade of human misery passing by--

TERL AND KER

Who enjoy their breakfast out on the heated patio of the Senior
Officer Mess Hall

TERL
I did some research on man-animals last
night They actually possessed certain
primitive technical abilities
(deat)
Surprisingly they even managed to fire
a crude probe into space

He slaps a picture of PIONEER ONE onto the table Ker shovels
yellow meat into his mouth as he eyes the photo dubious
KER
How do we know it came from man-animals

TERL
Because they were stupid enough to put a
plaque on it with pictures of themselves
One of our deep-space recons picked it
up And heres the kicker

Be points to the plaque visible in the photo

TERL (contd)

The plaque was made from a rare metal
thats worth a clanking fortune And in
addition to their pictures the man-
animals also included full directions to
their planet Thats how we came here

(loves this part)
They invited us

Ker cracks-up finding this hysterical Terl leans forward
giving him a conspiratorial wink

TERL (contd)
---And of course all this means the
plan has a good chance of working

Terl gets up and heads out Confused Ker chases after him
EXT STREET - MOMENTS LATER
Catching up to Terl Ker shakes his head

KER
But the plan cant work if the Planetship
doesnt order us to train man-animals--

TERL
--The Planetships hiding something
All we have to do is figure out what it
is and well have leverage over him

KER
(getting it)
And then we can get the gold--

TERL
--What do you mean we Its my plan

And before Ker can respond Terl heads into--

INT SECURITY HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS
And settles in behind his desk Ker follows on his heels
KER
Please sir You got to let me in on it

I barely make any credits in this lousy
job And Ive got five wives to support
Terl leans back in his chair rubbing a talon over his lips
pretending to be thinking this over And finally

TERL

OY I dont want to partner-up with an idiot
Ne (challenges)
How do I even know you understand the

plan

Still reclining in his chair Terl discreetly reaches under his
desk and pushes a GREEN BUTTON This isnt seen by--

Ker who rising to the task holds up the surveillance photo of
the mountain range

KER
We train man-animals who dont need
breath-gas to mine the gold for us

TERL
But Home Planet owns this planet The
gold belongs to them

Ker nods eager to prove he understands the whole plan

KER
Thats the beauty of it Home Office
doesnt even know the gold exists So
those corporate crap-heads will never
know we stole it Its the perfect crime

Oo

Be waits for Terls praise But instead Terl looks shocked
And in the gravest of voices

TERL

Putting aside the serious violations
of teaching mining to an inferior race
and insulting corporate superiors
each one in themselves punishable by
death you just advocated deliberate
theft of company resources

(resigned sigh)
So my duty requires me to report you
even though you will be vaporized and
Ill have to train a new assistant

Kers jaw is practically on the floor Terl promptly pushes a
RED BUTTON under his desk before--

KER
But it was your stinking idea

TERL
Which is why its a good thing I now
have a recording of you laying out the
plan and me reprimanding you for it

a What are you talking about We dont
have any recorders planted in here
(realizes)
Let me guess We dont But you do

Terl saunters over to a--

VAULT

Where he carefully positions his body to shield a KEYPAD from
Ker‘s view as he punches in numbers

The vault
and spare

TERL
Consider it part of your education

KER
«- Education

swings open Terl reaches in past a shelf of Blast-Gu
air-tanks popping a disc from a RECORDING MACHINE

TERL
Never engage in a criminal activity
until you set-up a patsy to pin
everything on in case youre found out

KER
Thank-you Thats great advice But
why do J have to be the patsy

TERL
So you wont be getting any bright ideas
about getting rid of ‘ole Terl in order
to keep all the gold for yourself toe

KER
But I would never double-cross you’

TERL
Of course not Because Im going to
set it up that if any ‘unfortunate
accident were to befall me
(re the disc)
This goes straight to Home Office

He files the disc away within a collection of other such
recordings housed within the vault then shuts and locks the ste

door
Ker isnt

happy about this but what can he do And to make

things worse he realizes

KER
Your whole plan depends on getting
leverage over the Planetship

(shakes his head)
But since theres no way to smuggle a
picto-recorder into his office without it
being detected how are we going to find
out what hes hiding--

TERL
--Youre the only qualified E-3 Level
Support Executive on this planet other
than the Assistant Planetship
(matter-of-fact)
So if something were to ‘accidentally’
happen to him
(catching on)
---Zd be the only qualified candidate
to replace him Good thinking sir
(rubs his paws together)
So how do we bump the bastard off

TERL
Dont worry about that Well do it in
an appropriate style But right now
we have a more pressing concern

EXT GUARDS TOWER -- ABOVE A MINE SITE -- THAT DAY

Terl and Ker enjoy their lunch up in a guard tower overlooking
the humans slaving away below Between mouthfuls Terl motions

down to JONNIE who struggles with a heavy load of ore

With almost a sense of begrudging respect Terl explains

TERL
«While that one does seem to be
unusually intelligent and resourceful at
least for a man-animal it also seems
rather defiant Which is why well need
leverage over it

KER
Leverage over man-animal

Terl gives him a sharp look Hasnt he been paying attention —

TERL
The only way its going to be able to
operate a mining machine is if it can
read Psychlo Which means we have to
educate it on a learning machine

Ker looks at Terl like hes off his rocker

KER
But if anyone found out--

TERL
Thats why we need leverage on it you
moron 6and0 no one finds out

Ker stares down at Jonnie exhausted by the idea

KER
We need leverage on the Planetship And
now we need leverage on the man-animals
I dont know about this plan of yours

Its like we need leverage on everyone

Thats what makes it so much fun

Ker dejectedly kicks a rock as he follows Terl up the street

KER

backward stride Jonnie is behind them He sends them
slamming together likeegg shells

He catches the gun of one as that Psychlo goes down and
stamps his heel into the side of his skull

He reverses the gun and batters the other Psychlo with shots
from a range of three inches

Jonnie drops on one knee and blows the two last Psychlos who
have exited the craft to bits

Five other Psychlos fire in his direction

Jonnies gun is empty He throws it down and picks up the
other one Flips the switch to kill

Totally unmindful of the shots ripping up the ground running

A LEARNING MACHINE

elegantly designed with sleek simplicity

And once the disc is inserted the machine emits a holographic im —
of a CHINKO which bows twice and puts its six sets of paws over
six eyes then talks in English albeit with a strange accent

CHINKO VOICE (FROM THE MACHINE)
Excuse me but I am your instructor if
you will forgive such arrogance for I do

Please forgive my pretension as I try
to educate you in Psychlo the Noble
language of Conquerors

An intense bright shaft of BLUE LIGET shoots out of the machine
striking Jonnie in the eyes

communication and utilizes subconscious
absorption allowing for instantaneous
comprehension

1 What Im Saying

Jonnie can understand but feigns a blank expression pretending
he doesnt Terl dangles a DEAD RAT in front of Jonnies eyes

TERL
AreYouHungryLittleGuy
But Jonnie keeps up his blank-face routine

Terl continues to ‘tease him with the rodent for a few beats
then pulls it away and restarts the machine turning to Ker

TERL (contd)
Obviously this is going to take a
while We might as well go get ourselves
some lunch

INT SECURITY HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

Terl and Ker head out the door The moment theyre gone Carlo
charges into--

INT BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

And tackles Jonnie out of the chair ‘saving’ him from the blue

beam bombarding his eyes

ia

CARLO
Told you your attitude was going to get
you into trouble Thats why the monsters
singled you out for the torture machine

JONNIE
Im not sure what it is but its not
torture Its like sleeping But when
you wake-up you somehow know things
(explains)
Like I can now understand what the
monsters are saying when they speak

Heywood appears in the doorway with a concerned look

HEYWOOD
--Whats going on

Carlo points to the Learning Machine with religious awe

CARLO
Its a god-machine that the monsters must
have stolen It makes you know things
JONNIE
I dont know if its a god-machine but I
do know Im going to use it to learn as
much as I can so I can figure out how
the hell were going to get out of here

Before Heywood can protest Jonnie reassures him--

JONNIE (contd)
If you can keep an eye out and give me
a little bit of warning before the
monsters come back I wont be putting
any of youin danger

Heywood is concerned but moves back to a window keeping a
vigilant eye on the street outside as

Jonnie inserts a new disc into the Learning Machine

“INT DENVER ZOO -- CAGE - NIGHT

In the corner of the cage out of view of the others Jonnie uses
a stick to fervently work out mathematical equations in the dirt

Carlo Heywood and the twins watch trying to make sense of the
foreign symbols Lo

SAMMY
-So thats what the monsters’
language looks like

Jonnie shakes his head his eyes shining with the rapture of pure
knowledge as he explains

JONNIE
This is mathematics The unifying
lanaquage of the entire universe Look

EXT EXECUTIVE OFFICERS MESS BALL -- THE NEXT DAY
Ker shrugs between mouthfuls of his lunch

KER
---SO its taking a bit longer with the
man-animals than we thought But they
cant be completely brainless if they
were able to fire a probe into space--

TERL
---Im not sure the man-animals did fire
that probe into space

KER
But you said there was a plaque on it
with the man-animals picture

Terl slowly sips a pan of kerbango as he explains

What if there was a species on a
different planet that detested man-
animals and its easy to see why they
would And this other species wanting
man-animals exterminated sent the probe
to us with directions to the man-animals
planet

KER
(beat)
I hadnt thought of that Its very
clever sir

INT SECURITY HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS

Jonnie watching Terl and Ker on a monitor while reading through
a Psychlo FIELD OPERATIONS MANUAL

In the rear of the room the rest of the guys push and pull at
the handle to the massive VAULT

JONNIE

translating from the manual )
The Security-Chief should secure the
field vault with an eight-digit
combination code of his selection He
should not write this code down Or
tell it to anyone else And he
shouldnt simply use his Employee ID
number but be more clever than that

Carlo gives Jonnie a hopeful look

CARLO
You dont think

Jonnie digs through Terls desk coming up with a FORM

JONNIE
The monster in charge is named Terl
(beat)
Bis employee number is on this
requisition form

He returns Carlos look with a shrug

JONNIE (contd)
Its worth a shot

EXT KEYPAD -- BANK VAULT -- MOMENTS LATER

Jonnie punches Terls emplo umb in thi YP

An entry light blinks req abd the door reset locked “eypad

Guess MICKEY
uess he was more Clever than that

Jonnie nods but then--
—-- ee ee

JONNIE
But the question is how clever Lets
try putting the numbers in reverse order

He inputs Terls employee Id-Number in reverse order A beat the
the entry light blinks green and the vault swings open

Our guys enter Jonnies attention is drawn to the RECORDING
MACHINE while Carlo Heywood and the twins check-out the Blast-
Guns and spare Breath-Gas Tanks

INT SECURITY HEADQUARTERS -- LATER THAT DAY

Terl and Ker march past Heywood Carlo and the twins who are all
busy painting the walls and head straight into

INT SUPPLY CLOSET -- CONTINUOUS
This time Terl dangles two dead rats in front Jonnie

TERL
DOYouWantLunch

But Jonnie keeps up his blank-face routine And is rewarded
for it by being picked-up by the head and launched out into--

INT SECURITY HEADQUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS’

Jonnie skids across the floor slamming into awall Terl
impatiently marches over to him pulling his Blast-Gun

TERL
Its obviously asking too much of these
mMan-animal things to grasp a language
as sophisticated as Psychlo

But Ker isnt willing to give-up hope of the gold and tries to
sound convincing as--

KER
What if this one is particularly stupid
Why dont we try to train another one--

TERL
--We dont have time

He storms over and grabs a series of surveillance photos from his
desk Jonnie discreetly signals across the room to

Carlo who holds his breath praying he doesnt get caught as

He slowly reaches between Terls legs and pushes the GREEN BUTTON
recording as

TERL
I cant keep hiding the recon-photos
from Home Office forever Plus at the
rate the glacier is melting the golds
about to fall into the ravine

KER
--S0 well get it then

TERL
Wed have to use explosives Home
Office would detect them and send down a
survey team which means we wouldnt be
able to keep the gold for ourselves

He takes one last forlorn look at the photos then lashes out in
anger delivering a vicious kick to Jonnie

TERL (contd)
And this damn things been on the machine
for two full days now and still cant
even speak one word Its hopeless
(mind made up)
We terminate the operation and cover our
tracks

i

He points his blast-gun down at Jonnie and--

JONNIE
What word would you like me to speak

Terl stares at Jonnie in amazement The man-animal just spoke

Psychlo

But to make sure hes not imagining this )

--What did you just ‘say

JONNIE
You heard me I asked you what word

it Oo

The rest of the guys cant understand what Jonnies saying but
theyre shocked to realize

Hes speaking to the monsters in their machine-like language as

TERL

In an unprecedented public display of joy hops up and down
pumping his arms in victory

TERL
It speaks It actually speaks
(as if Jonnie
was a toy)
Go on Say something else

JONNIE
Okay Hows this Youre going to stay
here as our prisoner
(instructs Ker)
While you go and bring back a truck

Terl more amused than anything clarifies

TERL
Just because I taught you how to speak
Psychlo youre still the inferior
race Which means I give you orders
You dont give me orders Understand

JONNIE
I understand that if you dont do
exactly what we tell you to do well
have no choice but to kill you both

TERL
Oh really And how exactly do you plan
to do that--

Jonnie gives the signal With a sudden flurry of movement--

Carlo Heywood and the twins pull BLAST-GUNS from behind their
paint buckets Jonnie keeps his attention on Terl

JONNIE
The next time you chose an access code
you might want to be a bit more clever
than just using your ID number in
reverse

But Terls only reaction is to chuckle
TERL
You sure they even know how to use those
things--

A COLLECTIVE CLICK as our guys slam the levers down on their gun
to kill position Ker immediately throws his arm up in surrende

And Terl is no longer chuckling He looks around at the guns
pointed at him and buries his head in his paws and begins to

How with laughter Convulsing so hard tears run down his face
TERL (contd)
Can you imagine the official report
(gasps for air)
Head of Security killed by man-animals

Still laughing hysterically he rears back to smack Jonnie But
Mickey jumps forward and FIRES his gun at Terl--

Only theres nothing but a CLICK The weapon doesnt fire

Sammy leaps forward and fires his Blaster CLICK His gun
doesnt work either Carlo and Heywood get the same result

HEYWOOD
«-Uh-oh

Teri still laughing follows through on his swing sending Jonn
flying across the room Then explains to him with a smirk
ew wee woe

— ro

If you rat-brains knew anything about
firearm safety youd know one doesnt
store Joaded weapons

Then he turns to take care of the others Goes to smack Samny--

But Mickey protectively grabs a LETTER-OPENER from a desk and wi
blinding speed plunges the blade straight for Terls chest--

Only as fast as Mickey is Terl is faster and he deflects the
blow with his arm sustaining a small cut in the process

Terl then promptly relieves Mickey of the letter-opener and seize
the trembling twin by the throat holding him firmly in place as-

TERL
Next time you want to stab someone let
me show you how to do it right--

He raises the sharp blade high above Mickeys chest--
JONNTE
(steel in his voice)
You hurt him I wont mine your gold
Terl pauses to consider this Then turns and convincingly bluffs
TERL
Then Ill vaporize you and get someone
else to mine the gold-—
JONNIE
--You dont have time You cant keep
hiding the recon-photos from Home Office
forever And the glacier is melting

In that one moment Terls whole world is turned upside down
Jonnie gives Terl a dangerous smile

JONNIE (contd)
Man getting leverage over a Psychlo
That would be the day wouldnt it

Rage burns openly in Terls eyes but he lowers the weapon and
calmly turns to Ker

TERL
e think its time we showed our
little friend here a thing or two

EXT DENVER LIBRARY -- THAT DAY

A Mark II Ground Car is parked in front of the library Locked
in a cage in the rear of the vehicle--

INT CARGO CAGE - CONTINUOUS

Carlo Heywood and the twins watch with concern as Terl drags
Jonnie by a leash across the street and up marble steps
INT DENVER LIBRARY - CONCOURSE -- MOMENTS LATER

Terls usual deep throated voice sounds even more ominous as it
echoes eerily in the librarys expansive entryway

on

As long as you cling to the feeble hope
that you can get the better of me
youll be distracted from the important
work which needs to be done Which is
why I share the following with you

He gives the leash a good hard jerk yanking Jonnie down a--

INT CORRIDOR -- CONTINUOUS
Terl moves at his normal gait forcing Jonnie to run to keep up

TERL (contd)

When we attacked your planet all your

- soldiers using your best military

technology were only able to put-up a
measly nine minute fight before we

H exterminated them along with all but

a few of the six billion humans

polluting this planet

He snaps the leash whiplashing Jonnie into--

INT CENTRAL RESEARCH ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The shelves lining this cavernous tomb of a room are stacked full
of books An endless variety of subjects and titles

TERL (contd)
Everything you humans knew is in here

He makes a big production of letting go of the leash giving
Jonnie full run of the place

TERL (contd)
And you can look at anything you want
Because theres nothing that can help
you

He watches amused as Jonnie takes him up on his offer pulling
books from shelves Terl cant resist calling after him--

TERL (contd)
But Im sure youll find a lot of recipes
on how to prepare raw rat

Terl cracks-up finding this particularly entertaining

— INT CARGO CAGE -- REAR OF GROUND CAR -- LATER THAT DAY

Mickey pensively shakes his head fearing the worst
MICKEY
Think hes still alive

( If he is he probably wishes he wasnt

A darkness hangs over the cage as everyone continues to stare uf
at the library where--

INT DENVER LIBRARY -- CENTRAL RESEARCH ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

Ter is filing his talons Across from him Jonnie finishes
looking through a large stack of books

Satisfied

) JONNIE
Yes

As Jonnie heads for the door Terl steals a peek at the book he
was just looking at Its the Declaration of Independence

But Terl cant read English Unconcerned he just shrugs
swatting the book across the room

EXT DOMED CITY -- EDGE OF A FIELD -- A LITTLE LATER
ar ws Ona rise overlooking the domed city a herd of grazing cows cas
ay curious stares across the field as the Mark II Ground Car pulls

Terl emerges from the vehicle followed by Jonnie

- TERL
You will soon be relocated to a new
mining site And if any of you get any
bright ideas about escaping keep in
mind that while you rat-brains may not
know anything about firearms I
certainly do I just happened to be
top marksman of my graduating class
And I can kill any of you at well over
a thousand paces

(to Jonnie)
Tell them what I just said

JONNIE
(relays to
the others)
If we try to escape hell shoot us

Terl waits for Jonnie to continue And when he doesnt

TERL
Thats it

Ne

Jonnie nods Terl is surprised but shrugs and continues with t
subject at hand He pulls his Blast-Gun explaining--
TERL (contd)
Allow me to demonstrate

He turns and FIRES into the middle of the--
J GRAZING COWS

ed

aot

Killing several of the animals The others take off in a panicked
stampede of churning hooves Terl continues to calmly fire--

Blasting the legs clean off the fast-moving animals Sending
them collapsing to the ground BELLOWING in anguished torture

Terl shows off with some trick shots From behind the back
With his eyes closed All with the same horrific result

The field littered with a bloody sea of suffering animals thrashi
around helplessly Sensing something behind them Jonnie turns--
’ EXT ACROSS THE FIELD -- CONTINUOUS

A GRIZZLY BEAR emerges from an abandoned building Nostrils
flaring at the smell of blood And with a growl he charges at--
EXT EDGE OF THE FIELD -- CONTINUOUS

Teri who is too busy with his shooting demonstration to notice

But he does note the look in Jonnies eyes as Jonnie starts back
away And misreading it as revulsion to the carnage on the fiel«

TERL
Dont you know your own history Man-
kind was the only animal on this planet
that hunted other animals for sport
(has to admit)
Which means there might be some hope for
your species after all--

The GRIZZLY slams into Terl from behind--

The fierce impact jars the gun from Terls grasp as hes violent
MAULED down And with the grizzly on his back pinning him down
Terl is unable to get his own talons up at--

THE BEAR

Who is starting to do damage Powerful claws savagely slashing
into Terls flesh as Terl remains unable to defend himself

Jonnie scoops up the gun switches it to stun position and FIRES
Knocking the grizzly flat by the shot Carlo cant believe it

CARLO
What are you doing Let the bear rip
aaa him to shreds--

Jonnie raises the weapon on Terl who bloodied and bruised sits
himself up and gives Jonnie a friendly smile
TERL
Look we can work out a deal

Theres

more than enough gold to go around--

JONNIE

-Youre in no position to be making a

deal

He switches the gun into kill position

CARLO
(now understanding)

Youre right Its better we kill him

And for the first time there is

KABLAM

Terls eyes open wide in shock

terror in Terls eyes He brac
himself waiting for the shot He doesnt have to wait long

He hasnt been hit The shot was directed at one of the sufferi)
cows behind him as Jonnie humanely ends the animal’ 8 misery

BLAM BLAM BLAM

Jonnie does the same with the rest of the herd

at the irony of it

Terl has to smi

TERL
Youve learned more Psychlo than I ever

thought possible

JONNIE
What are you talking about

TERL
To toy with me like this before you kill

me Im impressed
(genuinely)
You honor me

Be closes his eyes bows his head ready for his execution

Jonnie stands there the gun now sighted on Terl

aching to pull the trigger But he doesn

CARLO

too

What are you waiting for Kill him

JONNIE

If I kill him then what do we do

MICKEY
Get the hell out of here

JONNIE

To what kind of life Always looking
over out shoulders waiting for another

monster to come hunt us down

His finger

Ih

ee ce re

TERL cant understand what the man-animals are babbling about

But his eyes remain focused on the gun in Jonnies hand waiting
a for a chance to grab it--

But Jonnie keeps the weapon leveled on Terls chest as he
continues to address the others

JONNIE (contd)
--And what about the others back at the
mining camp

CARLO
Theres nothing we can do about them
(resigned)
Only the Gods can free them

JONNIE
Those lights we see in the sky at night
They are not Gods watching down on us

CARLO
What are you talking about

JONNIE
I learned our history today Our
ancestors built flying machines that
went up into the heavens I saw the

ro pictures with my own eyes
“pais (re the stars) -
( Those are planets Like this one They

are not gods waiting to come and save us
He waits a long beat for everyone to digest this then

JONNIE (contd)

And the great villages werent built by
gods They were built by people just
like us Men and women who cherished
one thing above all else Freedom

(impassioned)
It meant so much to them theyd fight
to the death for it if they had to In
fact many of them did

Inspired Mickey immediately steps forward

MICKEY
Youre right

His voice is a bit impulsive but full of conviction
MICKEY (contd)
We cant run away from the monsters We
have to fight them

His brother Sammy immediately joins him Heywood also ‘steps
forward in solidarity But Carlo isnt so sure

VF

CARLO
How the hell are we going to fight them
JONNIE

Im not sure yet But I do know were
not ready We need to learn more about
them Like their weaknesses

(concedes)
And were going to have to learn other
stuff as well I mean we didnt even
know the guns werent going to work

A long beat then with the look of a man who knows hes going to
regret this Carlo steps forward joining the others with a sigh

CARLO
--Which is why we have to go back
Terl watches as the damnedest thing happens
Jonnie turns to him returning the gun to him explaining it wit

JONNIE
Surely someone as smart as you has some
secret plan to stop me from shooting you
If I tried you would have killed me

In the blink of an eye Terl shifts his demeanor back to his old
caustic self-

TERL
Damn right I would have rat-brain
(chortles)
Thats the first intelligent thing
youve said yet

He points Jonnie to the far edge of the field

TERL (contd)
Rest-breaks over Theres something
else you need to see--

EXT FAR EDGE OF THE FIELD -- OVERLOOKING DENVER -- A LITTLE LATE
Terl proudly points down to the domed city below

TERL
That entire city doesnt even equal one
block in one of the hundreds of
thousands of cities on the great Home
Planet of Paychlo And from there we
control countless outposts all over the
universe Each one much larger than

this One of those outposts used to be
the Chinkos planet

Terl stares Jonnie straight in the eye making sure he understand

TERL (contd)
The Chinkos were the ones who designed
the Learning Machine They were far
more advanced than you rat-brains And
oy when they tried to revolt we sent down
( our gas drones and within minutes every
last one of them was exterminated
(sure of this)

So get it through your little excuse for

a brain There is no way a species as

primitive as yours could ever defeat us

He lets Jonnie chew on that for a beat then concedes

TERL (contd)
But you were right about one small thing
If you refuse to mine the gold I may not
have enough time to train anyone else
Which is why it is imperative that you
are properly motivated--

A SECOND Mark II Ground Car pulls up Ker emerges from the
vehicle and opens the trunk pulling out--

CBRISSY

Relief floods her eyes when she sees Jonnie At least hes alive

But as hard as it is to do Jonnie gives Chrissy an emotionless
vacant look Like she means nothing to him

( ) uO And Chrissy senses enough to duplicate this look Terl watches
Jonnie very closely

TERL
-You dont know her

He pulls out Chrissys charcoal drawing of Jonnie

TERL (contd)
This was on her when she was collected

Jonnie tries to hide the fear in his eyes at what Terl might do
He doesnt have to wait long to find out

Terl holds up a CHOKE-COLLAR with a red square on it

TERL (contd)
This collar has enough explosive to
easily remove her head from her body

Be secures the collar to Chrissys neck then pulls a REMOTE
CONTROL

TERL (contd)
And this remote can activate the
explosive from anywhere on the planet
OS os So if you ever disobey me let me show
7“ you exactly what will happen

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD -- A LITTLE LATER
Ker secures a second red-squared collar around Heywoods neck
JONNIE
Listen you win Ill mine your gold

And I know you dont owe me any favors
But please dont kill him

ferl stares at Jonnie A long beat Then he finally relents
TERL
Fine As a gesture to our new working
relationship I will grant you this one
request I wont kill him But you can
never ask for anything else again

JONNIE
I wont And thank-you--

Terl nonchalantly tosses the remote to Ker

TERL
As I said I wont kill him
Ker gives Jonnie an evil grin then slowly pushes the button--

KABLAM

Heywood is no longer among the living Terl and Ker laugh their
asses off at the shocked betrayal on Jonnies face

TERL
---Stupid humans

EXT DENVER ZOO -- THAT NIGHT

Returning the humans to their cage for the night Terl stares at
Mickey and Sammy Impossible to tell the twins apart

The two young brothers watch with growing concern as Terl motions
to them while asking Jonnie something in Psychlo
--What did he say
JONNIE
He wants to know which one of you tried
to stab hin
A look of knowing terror in Mickeys eyes

MICKEY
Why Whats he going to do

JONNIE
Unfortunately theres no way of
telling

Mickey nods accepting his fate whatever it may be He turns--

But Sammy has already stepped forward sacrificing himself to
Terl Mickey stunned tries to stop him--

TERL
Now that you and I have our little
agreement straight I want you to watch

whatll happen to them if any of you
ever disobey me

shield positioned a safe distance down the corridor

Crash into a simulated mountain

TERL

Crash one more time and your little

He holds up the REMOTE to Chrissys explosive collar then
restarts the simulator

INT DENVER ZOO CAGE - THAT NIGHT
Jonnie is back to sitting alone with a despondent look

Carlo and Mickey slowly approach Nothing is said for the

longest time And finally Jonnie looks up at Carlo

JONNIE

You were right I should have shot the

monster when I had the chance
(quietly)

That way Sammy and Heywood would still

os ) be alive

CARLO
You didnt kill them

JONNIE
No the monster did And I didnt kill
the monster when I could have
(tortured whisper)
Which means its my fault

MICKEY
You didnt kill the monster for a reason

Jonnie gives him a haunted look--

JONNIE
Thats the point If we try and fight
them more of us will end up getting
killed Maybe even everyone
(barely audible)
All because of me

Carlo shakes his head trying to hold back the anger

CARLO
ss This isnt just about you Remember what
Beywood said Its about all of us
MICKEY

And we need you You speak the monsters
language You know things about them

Jonnie looks around at the others in the cage who are now staring

o ° at him And he sees something on their faces hes never seen
Cp before Hope The longest of beats then
JONNIE

Everyone has to know If we do this
theres a good chance that not one of us
will be alive by the time its over

But not one person is deterred Carlo gives Jonnies words back

to him--

CARLO

Look around This aint exactly living

And even if we could escape and go back
to our villages wed always be looking

over our shoulder waiting to be hunted

down by the monsters

(pointed)

And that aint exactly living either

(fierce resolve)

‘ So if you can help us figure out a way
to fight the monsters no matter what it
is count us in

Never underestimate what a little
leverage can do rat-brain

Jonnie nods letting Terl believe what he wants to

Everyone in Jonnies cage crowds around him as he draws letters
in the dirt teaching the others to read and write Jonnie

passes the stick to Carlo who carefully starts to write letters
of his own

INT PLANETSHIPS OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING

The Planetship strolls into his office but freezes in his track
What the hell are Terl and Ker doing in his inner-sanctum

But then he sees the files all neatly laid out on his desk He
looks at them the life draining from his eyes

TERL
Isnt it interesting youve been keeping
two sets of books And while youve told
the workers that this planets operating at
a loss its actually quite profitable

The Planetship shakes his head feebly trying to explain

PLANETSHIP
I only claimed its running at a loss to
try and motivate everyone to work harder

Of course you did

(knowing smile)
And it had nothing to do with how it
allows you to cut everyones pay so you
keep all the extra credits for yourself

PLANETSHIP
Oh that I can explain that--

But Terl drops a heavy tome onto the desk with a resounding clang

TERL
wIm afraid company regulations
requires me to vaporize you
TERL (cont qd)
But I can see how someone in your
position faced with growing old and no

F - future might be forced to find creative
OC) ways to solve your financial problems
PLANETSHIP

eeeYOu can

TERL
And its not in any of our interests for
you to stop being the Planetship But
it may be prudent for you to start
sharing some of your authority

we ee ee

Ker hands the Planetship a huge sheaf of requisition and order
forms along with a pen to sign them

PLANETSHIP
But these forms are blank And undated
(shakes his head)
If I sign them you could put anything
you want on them Youd be running the
f entire planet Id be nothing but a
puppet--

TERL
--If you dont want to do it this way we
could always do it by the book

on He pats his Blast-Gun underscoring the threat
INT MINING SUPPLY WAREHOUSE -- THAT DAY
A SUPPLY CLERK stares incredulously at a requisition form
SUPPLY CLERK

What the hell does the Planetship need
with all this mining equipment

TERL

Thats not even the crazy part

(holds up an

order form)
Bes ordered me to take a group of man-
animals with the equipment out to a
remote area to see if they can be
trained to mine Can you imagine that

SUPPLY CLERK
Man-animals being able to mine The
old Psychios gone completely insane

TERL
Tell me about it But what can I do
(helpless shrug)
An orders an order
INT CARGO CAGE -- LATER THAT DAY
A BOWLING WIND cuts through a large steel cage containing Carlo
Mickey and some twenty other men along with an assortment of

mining machines and equipment The cage is suspended from the
underbelly of a--

PSYCHLO CARGO-TYPE AIRCRAFT

Which hurtles over the majestic Rocky Mountains Following
behind Ker is at the helm of a smaller fighter-plane

INT AIRCRAFT -- COCKPIT -- CONTINUOUS

Terl keeps a careful eye on Jonnie who is piloting the aircraft
An ALARM suddenly blares through-out the cockpit--

AUTOMATED VOICE (OVER SPEAKERS
Warning External sensors indicate
dangerous radiation levels ahead--
Blue sparks are starting to pop throughout the cockpit

For the first time there is genuine fear in Terls eyes He
immediately points to a meadow visible below--

TERL
What are you waiting for Land the
damn craft This is as far as I can go

Jonnie punches buttons on the control panel landing the aircraft

EXT MEADOW -- MOMENTS LATER

Terl motions Jonnie to the cargo cage as Ker land 1e £3 i
the meadow nescbe ej g s the fighter in )

TERL
Meet me back here in fourteen days with
at least half of that cage full of gold
or Ill ‘terminate your entire

operation

As the threat hangs there Terl checks his time-piece

EXT MEADOW -- A LITTLE LATER

The men have been assembled out on the meadow when theres an
ethereal almost otherworldly WAILING from above as--

A PSYCHLO RECON DRONE

Hurtles overhead One of the drones high-tech CAMERA-LENS
rotates to stare down at our guys
INT FIGHTER PLANE -- MOMENTS LATER

A TRANSMISSION RECEIVER spits out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO taken fre
the recon drone depicting Jonnie and the others staring up intc
the sky Ker hands it to--

EXT MEADOW -- CONTINUOUS

Terl who gives the surveillance photo to Jonnie

TERL
Tell them that even though I wont be
at the mining site Ill be able to
keep an eye on you
(admonishes)
And anyone who isnt working hard will
be ‘replaced if you know what I mean

He pats his blast-gun making sure Jonnie understands then turn
and climbs into the fighter as Ker pilots it up and away

Jonnie and the men start back to the cargo aircraft but Jonnie
instantly whirls Eyes scanning the underbrush in the tree line

He grabs a PICK-AX from the mining equipment holding it up as a
weapon Following his lead the rest of the men do likewise as

The bush moves And out from behind it steps--

A wild-eyed figure with the look of someone who has survived a
long time alone in the wilderness Ignoring the ‘array of weapon
pointed at him the ROGUE stares at Jonnie in complete awe

ROGUE ©
Howd you do it

JONNIE
«Do what

ROGUE

Make that monster go away without
killing you

Jonnie gives him a friendly smile

JONNIE
Im afraid its a long story

CARLO
And sorry pal wed love to fill you in
but we dont have a lot of time--

The rogue sizes up Jonnie and the rest of the men then nods as
hes reached some important decision and returns Jonnies smile

ROGUE
The names Mason and Ive got nothing
but time
EXT MINING SITE -- LATER THAT NIGHT

Jonnie lands the cargo-aircraft at the mining site and our guys

now including MASON begin hauling the equipment into the shelte

of a cave

Carlo looks up from the list hes been studying with a worried
expression--
CARLO

If we work around the clock well be
lucky to mine enough gold to fill half
that cage Theres no way were going
to be able to do that and get all this
stuff done we need for the revolt

JONNIE
Ive sot worse news Theres only gonna
be about half of you digging
(off their looks)
Im gonna be looking somewhere else for
it

EXT SHOPPING MALL -- THAT NIGHT

The cargo aircraft lands on top of the shopping mall where Jonni

and Carlo were first captured by the Psychlo wrangler

Jonnie and a small group of men emerge and race inside the build

Mickey and Sammys team assemble crude but effective-looking
homemade bombs from the mining equipment

INT PSYCHLO AIRCRAFT -- COCKPIT -- DAY

Jonnie pilots the aircraft Carlo is in the navigators seat
Behind him Mickey shakes his head--

behind and now pull on a series of thin wires which run through
a pulley system and out to

EXT MINING SITE - CONTINUOUS

Twenty DEPARTMENT STORE MANNEQUINS all decked out in mining gear
and holding shovels and pick-axes As the wires are pulled

The mannequins move like marionettes looking like they’ re hard
at work mining the gold

Well with my share Im going to fire
all my wives and buy new ones Maybe
even a pretty one What about you

TERL

Bribe my way off this god-forsaken planet

and get assigned a real position thats

worthy of my talents and training

That has got to be the stupidest thing Ker has ever heard

KER

Youre going through all this trouble

just so you can get a job

TERL
Not a job Respect

The fierce desire is palpable in his voice

EXT WASHINGTON DC -- LIBRARY OF CONGRESS -- THAT DAY

The cargo aircraft is parked next to the Library of Congress

INT LIBRARY OF CONGRESS -- CONTINUOUS

Books on uranium are spread across a table as Jonnie unfolds a
° RADIOACTIVE-SITE Map of the United States He traces his finger
a to’a mountain in Colorado which bears the radiation symbol of a
a triangle inside a circle
JONNTIE
Heres where were supposed to be mining
the monsters gold That symbol means —
radiation Which is caused by uranium

He moves his finger to an area in New Mexico

JONNIE (contd)
And heres where my tribe is located

MICKEY
--It has the same symbol

JONNIE
(looks up at them)

Do you guys know the names of the places
where youre from

MICKEY
A village called Los Alamos
CARLO
An island in what used to be the country

of Pennsylvania

JONNIE
Which island
CARLO
Three Mile Island

Jonnie finds Los Alamos and Three Mile Island on the map And
oy gure enough they both have the radiation symbol

— Carlo and Mickey dont understand Jonnie explains

JONNIE

From what Ive been able to figure out
many years ago the monsters attacked
our planet with a deadly gas Almost eee
everyone died except a few who made it
into underground shelters When the
air cleared these people came out but
were then hunted down by the monsters

(points to the map)
Only a few mist have made it to the
safety of these remote areas with
radiation where the Psychlos couldnt go
And were descendants of those people

Mickey nods realizing this is good news

MICKEY
So even if we fail to take over the
planet our people will be safe as long
as they stay in areas with this
radiation thing

JONNIE
Theyd be safe from the monsters
(the bad -ews) °
But radiation isnt good for humans
either Thats why a lot of people in
our villages get sick and dont live as
long as they should

He stares at them making sure they understand

JONNIE (contd)
So if we dont take back our planet our
people cant leave these areas or
theyll be hunted down But if they
stay in these areas over time more and
more of them will get sick and die
(the grim reality)
the last of humanity will
slowly but steadily become extinct

EXT LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY -- FORT KNOX -- LATER THAT DAY

The aircraft lands next to FORT KNOX Our guys emerge carryin
large Psychlo equipment cases and head into the buiiding” 9

MICKEY
If golds so valuable to them how come
- the monsters havent already taken it
out of here
JONNIE

From what I read in the library the
gold here is stored in lead-lined vaults
to protect it from the radiation in case
of a nuclear war

(beat)
And that lead would keep the monsters
from detecting the gold

INT FORT KNOX -- GOLD DEPOSITORY -- A LITTLE LATER

Our guys stand in front of an imposing vault

CARLO
--¥YOu sure were going to be able to
get through this

Jonnie and Mickey fire-up a Psychlo LASER-DRILL

INT AIRCRAFT - DAY

Jonnie yanks the cover from the stacks of gold bars
harvested at Fort Knox
EXT MEADOW -- NIGHT

Jonnie stands next to a cargo cage half-full of GOLD BARS as he
waits for Terl to land his aircraft and climb out

Terl is impressed but also instantly suspicious

TERL
Why is it in bars

JONNIE
We figured someone of your stature
wouldnt want something as coarse as
raw ore

Terl doesnt look convinced until he runs a hand-held COMPOSITION
ANALYZER over the gold It checks out as the real thing

Hiding his glee Terl turns back and growls at Jonnie--

TERL
I obviously need to adjust the
schedule Since you rat-brains had
enough extra time to smelt the gold
into bricks I will now expect the rest
of the gold in seven days

Not bothering to wait for a response Terl loads the glorious
gold into his aircraft

INT MINING SITE CAVE -- NIGHT
Jonnie and the rest of the men have reassembled back at the cave

CARLO
So if we dont give him the rest of the
gold in seven days hell kill us But
if we do give him the gold

MASON
--Be no longer needs us

CARLO
Which means hell kill us

But Jonnie doesnt look the least bit concerned

JONNIE
All this means is that our deadlines
been moved up a bit We now have seven
days to take back our planet

i The group nods trying to match Jonnies confidence as Jonnie

gets down to business opening a MAP of Denver He points to the
ZOO in the middle of the city
JONNIE
According to the monsters Field
oN ‘Manual even a large-scale escape of
et human slaves from the zoo would only
constitute a stage-one alarm

MICKEY
To the monsters itd be like a bunch
of horses escaping

JONNIE
Because the monsters only see us as
harmless animals they wont be
wearing battle-gear when they come to
round us up
(a gleam in his eye)
Which means they wont have on their

t
No one seems too happy about the comparison But Jonnie nods

i

Mickey excitedly jumps in again beating Jonnie to the punch-lir

MICKEY
And any monsters outside a building
without a breath-mask wont be able to
breath once Carlo blows up the dome

Ali eyes spin to Carlo who gives a confident thumbs-up

CARLO
Piece-of-cake

MASON
-What about the monsters that are
inside the buildings when the dome blows

JONNIE
Theyll survive And we can expect them
to come at us in a second assault But
thats where you guys come in

His eyes sweep the group as he explains

JONNIE (contd)

Everyones going to train how to use the
monsters weapons Then well sneak you
in to blend in with the rest of the
people who escaped from the zoo

(beat)
So when Carlo takes out the first wave
of monsters you guysll jump out and
grab their weapons then set-up an
ambush for the second wave of monsters
who will be wearing breath-masks

CARLO
Plus Ill be flying overhead raining
explosives down on the bastards
C)

Excitement spreads through the group The plan actually has a
chance of working But then Jonnie adds

JONNTE
But everyone needs to understand The
moment we blow the dame or fight back in
anyway this becomes a stage-two alarm

MICKEY
And thats the one thing we cant let
happen right

JONNIE

Right A stage-two alarm means the
monsters alert their Home Planet And
moments later thousands of troops and
gas drones will be teleported here

(levels with them)
There‘s no way we could fight that Wed
all be dead within seconds

The groups excitement instantly turns to confusion

MASON
-Then what the hells the point of
killing all the monsters on this planet -
if were all going to get wiped out

JONNIE
Because before this thing gets to a
stage-two alarm
(matter-of-fact)
Were going to destroy their Home Planet

Everyone stares at him He must be joking But he isnt

EXT TEXAS -- FORT HOOD -- THE NEXT DAY

Jonnie and a handful of men emerge from a Strategic Weapons Vault
carrying out crates of conventional explosives as well as

INT FORT HOOD -- NUCLEAR TRAINING FACILITY -- A LITTLE LATER

Mickey restlessly pokes around exploring the classroom as Jonnie

must be wrong with their heads

In the back of the room Mickey points to an old PHOTO of
a BATTALION OF CADETS all with their hands to their foreheads

JONNIE
Nothings wrong Theyre saluting Its
a sign of respect

He salutes showing Mickey then gets back to the business at
hand continuing to read from the manual--

JONNIE (contd)
-Make-sure the firing-mechanism is
properly in place and operational

Jonnie and Carlo both take deep breaths then pick up tools and
gingerly go to work on the warhead--

INT DENVER -- MORGUE -- CONTINUOUS

Terl rips the lid off of a coffin and yanks out the dead Psychlo
dumping the corpse to the ground and kicking it out of his way

He repeats the process with another coffin uriceremoniously
flinging the corpse to the ground then fires up a LASER DRILL
and blasts away carving FALSE BOTTOMS into the caskets

INT FORT HOOD -- NUCLEAR TRAINING FACILITY -- THAT DAY

With the nuclear warhead now partially dismantled Jonnie and
Carlo carefully remove a lead plate with surgical precision

JONNIE

Whats the auto-sensor look like
JONNIE

The illustrations are in Appendix-A

We couldnt find Appendix-A

The bomb will detonate
Great

Still whistling his war song Terl begins filling the false
bottoms in the coffins with his beloved gold

INT MINING SITE -- CAVE -- THAT NIGHT

Everyone congregates around the map of Denver one last time as
Jonnie finalizes the battle plan

JONNIE
Once the prisoners escape from the zoo
Chrissy will lead them here to the Civic
Center Park Thats where you guys will
be waiting to blend in with them And
when the guards are sent to round all of
you up it should leave minimal resistance
here at the teleportation platform--

He points to a section of the city away from the park

JONNIE (contd)
Which is when well move in and secure
the platform and teleport the nuclear
weapon up to their planet

Mason points to the nuclear warhead

MASON
-And youre sure that thing will be
enough to take-out their entire planet

JONNIE
Radiation explodes their breath gas
Which is exactly the same as their
planets atmosphere

Mickey slowly raises his head A darkness in his voice

MICKEY
With all respect sir Id like to be the
one who goes up and detonates the weapon

JONNIE
Its brave of you to offer But its my
plan so I go--
MICKEY
Cy --You dont understand I want to go
— ° (determined)
So I can see my brother again

Jonnie stares at Mickey his heart breaking But this time
Jonnie has no choice He has to tell him

JONNIE
Theres no point in you going No human
ean breath on their planet Plus the
gravity is too strong Im sorry
(soft)
But your brother was dead within moments
of being there

Mickey returns Jonnies look without blinking

MICKEY
I know Thats why I want to go
(quietly)
So I can be with him again

A long beat Then Jonnie finally nods giving Mickey his wish

Ker comes strolling out of the bar when a figure suddenly steps
out of the shadows in front of hin Its JONNIE--

JONNIE
Theres no way Terls going to share any

KER
What the hell are you talking about
And what are you even doing here youre
supposed to be mining--

JONNIE
--Think about it Terl went through all
that effort to trick you so he could
record you into laying out the plan It
was more than just making you the patsy

«--What kind of trade
INT CHRISSYS CAGE A LITTLE LATER

Ker uses a special tool to remove the explosive collar from
Chrissys neck then trades the collar for the disc

JONNIE
How about we make another trade
(motions to the
zoo cage KEY)
As a male member of your species you
can understand why I would want to come
and ‘visit’ with her--

KER
--Forget it crap-head You just keep
your mind on getting the rest of the
gold

JONNIE

(holds up a SECOND DISCc)
Because the gold is almost ready and I
thought you might want some incriminating
evidence on your friend Terl

Too bad

Ker doesnt have to think about it He immediately trades the
zoo key for the second disc As soon as Ker is gone

‘ Chrissy gives Jonnie a confused look

CHRISSY
Wont the monster in charge be able to
see Im no longer wearing the collar

JONNIE
(hands her the key)
After tonight it wont matter much
either way

Theres an unspoken tension between them The first time theyve
alone since he left their village Chrissy tries to cover it with

She nods

of beats

CHRISSY
I know you dont believe in fate but
Ive always known you were destined to
do something great

JONNIE
--Were going to do something great
All of us together

but theres still something not being said The longest
And finally Jonnie struggles to find the right words
JONNIE (contd)
And we need to do this not only for our
own freedom but for the possibility of a
life for the children

Chrissy looks at him and starts to ask something but doesnt

He returns her look clarifying

JONNIE (contd)
A life for our children
(quickly adds)
Of course only if youd be willing to
take an ‘arrogant greener as your
husband

CHRISSY
I dont know
(warm smile)
I think I could live with that

They embrace Each of them knowing it might be the last time

Terlcomes strolling into the office but suddenly stops in his
tracks EVERY MONITOR in the room is playing a recording of--

TERL (ON THE MONITORS )
-Wed have to use explosives Home
Office would detect them and send down a
survey team which means we wouldnt be
able to keep the gold for ourselves

Ker smugly pauses the disc FREEZING the guilty evidence

KER
Ive been thinking Eighty-twenty is a
pretty fair distribution of the gold
(loving every
moment of this)
But J should get the eighty per cent

Terl stares at him And without hesitation

TERL
Congratulations I knew there was a
true Psychlo in you somewhere

Ker remains on guard Hes not about to fall for any traps
But Terl seems genuinely happy if not downright ecstatic

TERL (contd)
You finally figured out how to get
proper leverage on someone

I made a copy of your dise and gave it
to someone for safe keeping And if

into the authorities

You were just too good of a teacher

TERL
And how about giving the old teacher a
clue as to who this person might be

You insult yourself sir You taught me
better than to fall for that one

Well then how the hell am I supposed to
know who it is I mean it could be
anyone on this damn planet It could
be one of the mechanics It could be a

Terl raises his blast gun

KER
Dont shoot You win Ill go back to

Be fumbles a disc out of his pocket and hands it to Terl

KER (contd)
See Thats the disc of me laying out
the plan You can have it back Which
means Im back to being the patsy And
you cant kill the patsy right

TERL
Heres your final exam Try real hard
to pass it When committing a crime
how many patsies does one need

As Ker chews on this Terl reminds him--

- TERL (contd)
And while youre thinking remember all
the hard work we put into getting
leverage on the Planetship A process
I might add that you were quite
resourceful in helping with

KER
The Planetship ordered us to train the
man-animals to mine the gold So if
anyone found out hed be responsible
(practically crying)
And you only need one patsy
