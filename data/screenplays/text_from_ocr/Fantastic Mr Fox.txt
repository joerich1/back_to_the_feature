EXT WOODS DAY

An apple tree stands alone at the top of a hill A handsome
fox dressed in an Edwardian-style navy velvet suit leans
against it with his arms folded and his legs crossed

on a reed of wild grass He holds an apple core in his paw
He spits out a seed He looks off across a meadow that
descends into the valley below
A female fox strides briskly up the hill Her coat is a
paler especially beautiful shade of fox-red and she wears
mens trousers and a dark tunic Fox says as she approaches

FOX
Whatd the doctor say

MRS FOX
Nothing Supposedly its just a twenty-
four hour bug He gave me some pills

FOX

(REASSURINGLY)
I told you You probably just ate some
bad gristle
Fox brushes the fur on Mrs Foxs ears with his paws They
walk together along the crest of the hill to a fork in the
path Fox points

FOX
Should we take the short cut or the
scenic route

MRS FOX
Lets take the short cut
from

FOX
But the scenic route is so much prettier

MRS FOX

(SHRUGS)
OK lets take the scenic route

FOX
Great Its actually slightly quicker
anyway
Fox throws his apple core away over his shoulder and danc

quick circle around Mrs Fox wrapping his arm around her
waist extravagantly and making her laugh as they start of
down the scenic route

EXT FARM DAY

A rustic cottage surrounded by a small barn a tin silo
a rickity windmill There is a sheep in a little pasture
sign on a rail says Berkus Squab Fox and Mrs Fox watch

the bushes outside a fence

MRS FOX
What is a squab

FOX
You know what a squab is Its like a
pigeon I suppose Anyway its a type of
bird we can eat
Fox motions toward the edge of the property

FOX
Should we go through the hole under the
horse fence or climb the rail over the
bridle path

MRS FOX
Well I guess the horse fence would be a
little safer

es

f

and
A
this

FOX
But the bridle path puts us out right
next to the squab shack
Mrs Fox hesitates She fiddles with her paws She nods
nervously She shakes slightly Fox looks at her funny

FOX
Whats wrong Ive never seen you like
this Youre acting all skittish Dont
worry Ive been stealing birds for a
living since before I could trot

MRS FOX

(SHRUGS)
OK lets take the --

FOX
No well do the horse fence You gave me
the scenic route already
Fox flashes a smile He says suddenly

FOX
By the way you look unbelievably
beautiful tonight Youre practically
glowing Maybe its the lighting

Mrs Fox is in fact glowing albeit ever so slightly She
stares at Fox enigmatically Fox touches his paw to her
cheek

(NOTE an alternate version of Mrs Fox will be used for

hot which can be literally lit from within)

ith the speed grace and precision of athletes Fox and
Fox dart through a hole under a painted fence race
long a thin trail next to a garage crawl beneath a window
here a blonde woman serves an early dinner dealing
amburgers like playing cards to three little blond
hildren creep past a doghouse where a golden retriever
leeps with an airline sleeping mask over his eyes and
himmy over a doorway outside a workshop where a blond
bearded farmer hacks into a stump with a hatchet completely

HBunanyrso So
wooden

pulverizing it into sawdust They arrive in front of a

shed Fox whistles sharply with a half-chirp and performs a
rapid reverse-flip with a flourish

Fox lifts a loose board He looks to Mrs Fox and puts his
finger to his lips for her to be quiet She shrugs
impatiently They duck inside

They come back out Each holds a dead bloody pigeon in
hisher teeth They start to run away Fox looks up above
them He stops He frowns He takes the pigeon out of his
mouth and says curiously pointing toward the sky

FOX
Whats that I think thats a fox-trap
Look at this

MRS FOX
Get away from there

FOX
Is it spring-loaded Yeah
(pointing to different spots)
I guess if you come from over there and
youre standing at the door to the squab
shack this little gadget probably
triggers the --
(gesturing to Mrs Fox)
Move out of the way darling Thats
right where its going to land
Mrs Fox runs back to Fox and tugs at his arm

MRS FOX
Come on Stop it Lets go

Fox pulls on a little hanging wire A chain unrolls rapidly
from a pulley and a steel cage falls slap down on top of
them A small tag on the base of it says Badoit et Fils Fox
and Mrs Fox stand motionless side by side in disbelief

FOX
No it just falls straight down right
here doesnt it I guess its not spring-
loaded
Sounds come from around the farm the dog barks doors open
voices yell lights come on Mrs Fox turns to Fox and says

QUIETLY

MRS FOX
Im pregnant
Fox stares at Mrs Fox He is confused but moved

FOX
Wow Were going to have a cub Honey

MRS FOX

If were still alive tomorrow morning I
want you to find another line of work
Pause Fox nods

bedrooms behind it Fox sits at the kitchen table reading a
newspaper called the Gazette His fur has gone grey at the
temples and he now wears a dark double-breasted pin-
striped suit with a conservative necktie Mrs Fox stands at
the counter-top stirring something in a bowl with a whisk

She is dressed in a paint-splattered cream-colored
Victorian-style dress
INSERT
A column in the newspaper with Foxs picture at the top of

girlfriend just said to me last week I
should read Foxys column but they
dont get the Gazette
(yelling into the next room)
Ash Lets get cracking

FOX
Why would they Its a rag-sheet

(SIGHS)
I want to say I hate my job but that
would make it seem more important to me
than I want people to think it is
Mrs Fox puts down her bowl and starts slicing a loaf of
bread A small narrow fox cub comes out of one of the
bedrooms wearing white pants and no shirt His hair is
smashed all onto one side sticking up wrong He is Ash

ASH
Im sick

MRS FOX
Youre not sick

ASH
I have a temperature
Mrs Fox goes quickly over to Ash and puts her paw to his
forehead

MRS FOX
You dont have a temperature
Ash turns away and says as he goes back into his bedroom

ASH
I dont want to go
says

MRS FOX

Hurry up Youre going to be late

Mrs Fox goes back into the kitchen and starts making toast
and coffee Fox whispers to her

FOX
I love the way you handled that
Mrs Fox looks at Fox sideways She says loudly to Ash

MRS FOX

Your cousin Kristoffersons coming first

extra nice to him because hes going

Ash comes back out of his bedroom He now wears a white
cardigan and white socks with his white pants tucked into
them He says aggressively

ASH
Wheres he going to sleep

MRS FOX
Were going to make a bed for him in your
room tonight

ASH
I cant spare the space Put him in Dads
study
Fox says without looking up from his newspaper

FOX
Dads study is occupied by Dad
Ash goes back into his bedroom Fox lowers his newspaper He
looks around the room He says to Mrs Fox

FOX
I dont want to live in a hole anymore
It makes me feel poor
Mrs Fox stops buttering the toast She looks to Fox and

SOFTLY

MRS FOX
We are poor -- but were happy
Fox twists his paw in the air indicating

FOX
Comme-ci comme-ga Anyway the views are
better above ground
Mrs Fox nods She brings Fox a plate of toast and a cup of
coffee Fox takes her paw and says

FOX
Im seven non-fox-years old now My
father died at seven and a half I dont
want to live in a hole anymore and Im
going to do something about it
Fox kisses Mrs Foxs paw He suddenly eats three slices of
toast in a second and a half savagely but neatly He stands
and picks up his cup of coffee

FOX
Well Im off
Fox throws back the last of his coffee kisses Mrs Fox on
the back of her neck grabs his briefcase tucks his
newspaper under his arm and walks to the door He shouts

CHEERILY

FOX
Have a good day my darlings
Ash comes out the bedroom again He has now added a white
cape to his ensemble and is in the middle of brushing his
teeth There is toothpaste all over his mouth He waves
briefly to Fox and goes back into his bedroom Fox looks
puzzled

FOX
Whats he wearing
Mrs Fox shrugs She smiles sadly and waves to Fox Fox
waves
back He starts to go out but pauses to look down at a
folded
up section of his newspaper

from the ceiling and a layer of dust over everything A
skinny weasel in a khaki outfit immediately starts in as Fox
comes into the living room

WEASEL

Weasel is interrupted by a loud banging clank He and Fox
peer into the next room A heavy-set opossum with a cowlick

WEASEL

Weasel sighs He waves his arm in Kylies direction and

distractedly slightly annoyed

Weasel makes a fluttering gesture with his paw Fox nods He
points at a bucket on the floor next to Kylie among bolts
tools and washers
wriggling

FOX
Whats in the bucket Mr Kylie

KYLIE

(HESITATES)
Just minnows You want one

FOX
Certainly Thank you
Kylie reaches into his bucket and hands Fox a live

minnow Fox swallows it whole

Fox stares out the window at three sprawling poultry
compounds in the distance Black smoke pours out of a
farmhouse chimney on each property A sign on a water tower
in the first compound reads Boggis Farms and has a picture

a chicken on it A sign on a silo in the second compound
reads Bunce Industries and has a picture of a goose on it A
sign on a windmill in the third compound reads Bean inc

(since 1976) and has a picture of a turkey with an apple on

it
Weasel says pointedly from across the room

WEASEL
May I ask what you do for a living Mr
Fox
Foxs eyes narrow as he looks out entranced with his mouth
slightly open He says almost inaudibly

FOX
I used to steal birds but now Ima
newspaper man

WEASEL
(PLEASED )
Oh sure Ive seen your by-line

Fox snaps out of his reverie and says suddenly

FOX
at

Good afternoon gentlemen

Fox shakes hands abruptly with Weasel and starts across the
room Weasel is about to ask something when Fox stops in the
doorway looks back and says

FOX
Oh and Kylie -- thank you for the
minnow It was superb
Kylie smiles Fox exits

INT BEANS SHED DAY

Bean works at a moonshine-type cider still boiling
chemicals
and sipping from a bottle

BADGER (V0)

the biggest cusshole Ive ever met in my
life

awkward back-flip during which he appears to have four arms
and three legs randomly attached to his body flailing
wildly He hits the water by the side of his head and smacks

Ash thinks for a minute He looks at Kristofferson in the
next room Kristofferson is now sitting Indian-style on the
floor meditating His paws are turned upward with his thumbs
touching his index fingers forming a ring Ash says loudly

Mrs Fox in the kitchen

ASH
How long is Kristofferson supposed to
stay with us

MRS FOX
Until your uncle gets better

ASH
Right but roughly how long do we plan to
give him on that Double-pneumonia isnt

practicing violent karate kicks Mrs Fox leans into the
doorway and whispers forcefully

MRS FOX

chickens and Kylie has one live one Fox yells

Fox hesitates confused A gunshot fires from among the
chicken houses Fox shouts to Kylie

FOX

Follow me again

Fox and Kylie run back across the barnyard past the beagles
as they begin to wake up and stagger around Farmhands
appear loading shotguns and running into the confusion Fox
and Kylie race by unnoticed among them They dart into the
house through a flap in the back door The lights are out in
the kitchen They take a moment breathing hard in the
darkness Kylie shakes his head in disbelief

shouts to Kylie

flap race across the barnyard and dart through the open
gate Up the road Boggis screams furiously as he runs with
his pack of beagles and farmhands Fox and Kylie fly into

bushes As they race through the underbrush Fox says
BREATHLESSLY

FOX

INT BEANS SECRET CIDER CELLAR NIGHT

A vast damp gloomy cellar with hundreds of glass jars
stacked from floor to ceiling Each jar is marked Cider Fox
and Kylie come inside and quietly drop to the brick floor

KYLIE WHISPERS

KYLIE
Look at all this apple juice

FOX

(STERNLY)
Apple juice Apple juice We didnt come
here for apple juice This is some of the
strongest finest alcoholic cider money
can buy -- or that can even be stolen It
burns in your throat boils in your
stomach and tastes almost exactly like
pure melted gold

(SUDDENLY)

Lets crack open one these shine jars

and do a shooter

A match strikes in the darkness Fox and Kylie look around
the room frantically On the highest shelf peering out from
behind a huge jar they see an enormous rat in a striped
shirt with a lit match in his claw He puts the flame in his
mouth to snuff it out and holds the matchstick in his teeth
He is longer than a fox and wiry but with a small pot-

He wears a black beret and moves like a beatnik
He takes a draw from a small rubber tube inserted in the

of his cider jar He says with a slightly sinister New
ORLEANS ACCENT

RAT
Yall are trespassin now Illegally
Round these parts we dont take kindly
to cider poachers
Fox and Rat stare at each other Fox says finally

FOX
Youve aged badly Rat

RAT
Youre gettin a little long in the
tooth yourself partner
Rat spins around and hurls himself scuttling over a shelf
down the wall and through the air onto the brick floor at
Foxs feet He flicks open a switchblade and brandishes it
He hisses

ylie shrieks and darts into a hole where a brick is missing
in the wall Fox takes an old-fashioned boxing stance

RAT

Hows your old lady doin

ylie peers out from his hole in the wall nervously Fox and
Rat circle each other slowly

FOX
Do you refer to my wife

RAT
She was the town tart in her day Wild
and foot-loose and pretty as a mink

stole She was a creme brulee -- until
you made an honest woman out of her Mr
Fox

Kylie says intrigued from his hole

KYLIE
Is that true
He

tenses

FOX

(ANNOYED)
Of course not I mean certainly she
lived We all did It was a different
time Lets not use a double-standard
She marched against the --

KYLIE
But town tart

FOX
Shut up
Rat lunges at Fox with his switchblade Fox dodges nimbly

cocks an eyebrow and smiles

FOX
That was close Rat Be careful

RAT
Oh Im as careful as a --
A door at the top of the stairs opens suddenly with a loud
creak Rat and Fox look terrified They both dart away and
hide behind cider jars
A heavy-set middle-aged housekeeper carrying a rolling pin
comes down the stairs and walks straight over to the shelf
where Fox is hiding

HOUSEKEEPER
How many jars should I bring up maam
A strong almost masculine womans voice answers from

UPSTAIRS

MASCULINE VOICE
I dont know Two I guess
The housekeeper grabs the two jars directly next to the one
Fox is hiding behind and tucks them under her arm Fox

arm sticks out barely from behind his jar The housekeeper

HOUSEKEEPER

MASCULINE VOICE

The housekeeper grabs Foxs jar Fox closes his eyes

MASCULINE VOICE

The housekeeper stops with her hand on the neck of Foxs

MASCULINE VOICE

Threes too many Its unhealthy Hes

anorexic Bring two

The housekeeper lets go of Foxs jar Fox relaxes slightly
The housekeeper grabs Foxs jar again Fox tenses up

HOUSEKEEPER
But maybe just in case --

MASCULINE VOICE
Twos plenty
The housekeeper lets go of Foxs jar and walks away She
back up the stairs and closes the door Kylie says in the

DARKNESS

KYLIE
Oh my cuss That was like a scene out of

A --
The door opens again An exceptionally tall powerfully

woman in a black dress and Wellingtons with grey hair

back in a bun bright green eyes and a meat cleaver tucked
under her apron strings comes swiftly down the stairs She

eyeballs the corners of the room She is Mrs Bean She says
Bunce

thickly (in her masculine voice)

MRS BEAN

To whom it may concern if I catch a rat

in a black beret drinking Mr Beans

secret cider without his express

permission I intend to chop said rats

head off brine it pickle it and bake

it in a vermin casserole I hope this

clarifies my position on the matter

Sincerely Evelyn Bean

Mrs Bean turns and goes back up the stairs She closes the
door Pause Rats voice says from the shadows

RAT
Dear Mrs Bean your language while
somewhat purple is nevertheless
impossible to misinterpret However --
comma -- given the proximity of said rat
at the moment of your --

Fox and Kylie running away from Beans farmhouse with two
jars of cider They both look badly shaken A gunshot rings
out taking us to

EXT BEAN FARMS NIGHT

Bean is standing darkly in his front doorway Smoke drifts
from the end of his Luger pointed at the ceiling A broken
light bulb hangs from a wire above his head Boggis and

sit together on the porch in rocking chairs startled
staring at Bean

BEAN
Im going to give a speech and at the
end of it -- Im going to throw a twist

into this plot
Bean lights a cigarette and begins to walk slowly around the
porch

BEAN
First truth this is the most ambitious
fox weve ever encountered bar none
Bean spins around and shoots out a second light bulb Boggis
and Bunce look uneasy Bean continues
goes

stool

BEAN
Second truth the meaning of ambition is
defined in the dictionary
Bean jumps and rolls and shoots out a third light bulb

BEAN
Third truth the weakness of the
ambitious man is his Achilles heel --
Bean quickly shoots out three more light bulbs behind his
back over his shoulder and between his legs The porch

dark He flicks on a flashlight and points it in his two
colleagues faces They look scared Bean says urgently

BEAN
-- but Ive already figured out where
this fox lives and tomorrow night were
going to camp in the bushes wait for him
to come out of the hole in his tree and
shoot the cuss to smithereens Hows that
grab you fellas
Boggis and Bunce hesitate They nod and murmur their
approval

INT FOXS TREE NIGHT

in their prowling outfits They walk to the door

licks his finger and holds it up to test the direction of

Boggis and Bunce

EXT FOXS TREE NIGHT

Fox pokes his head up out of his hole He sniffs once He
moves an inch forward and stops He sniffs again He waits a
moment and listens He steps out of the hole and says

row He turns to a confused Kylie and says panicking

FOX
All three
Fox and Kylie spin around and dart back into the hole as
Boggis Bunce and Bean open fire wildly from the bushes A
barrage of bullets and buckshot rips into the tree-bark
Silence

Smoke from the three guns floats upward in the night air
Boggis Bunce and Bean approach the tree Bean shines his
flashlight on Foxs hole

In the circle of light on the ground lies the tattered

stained remains of Foxs tail Bean picks it up and holds it
in the air in front of Boggis and Bunce

BEAN
We got the tail but we missed the fox
Pause Bean takes out his walkie-talkie

BEAN

gauze and medical tape She looks furious Kylie and the Fox
cubs watch concerned Ash says uncertainly

ASH

KYLIE
(shaking his head)
Tails dont grow back except for

FOX

(MISERABLY)
Tails dont grow back Im going to be
tail-less for the rest of my life

ASH

(NERVOUSLY)
Well anyway its not half as bad as

His dads got one foot in the grave and
one foot on a banana peel Thats a lot
worse than --
Kristofferson hurls an acorn violently onto the floor It
ricochets off a wall and into a teacup Everyone falls
silent Kristofferson turns away

KRISTOFFERSON
Excuse me everyone Im going to go
meditate for half an hour
Kristofferson walks out of the room Mrs Fox looks at Ash
and says angrily

MRS FOX

Youve got twenty-nine minutes to come up

with a proper apology

Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares
straight ahead into space grimly Fox says suddenly

FOX
Whats with the crazy outfit Why a cape
and the pants tucked into your socks
Ash does not respond Fox sighs Mrs Fox finishes bandaging
his tail Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back
to the room

FOX

I got fired slash quit the Gazette and
started stealing chickens on the sly

MRS FOX

Kylie shouts in a pained voice

KYLIE
You say one thing she says another and
it all changes back again
The point of a shovel pierces the ceiling Everyone looks up
and stares in shock Fox suddenly leaps across the room with
a wild energy scrambles halfway up a wall and throws over
two chairs

FOX
Ive got it Theres not a moment to

The shot stops at the bottom of a dark hole deep deep
underground Mrs Fox lies on the floor breathing heavily
with a lit lantern at her side The cubs are sprawled out
around her Kylie leans in the corner with his shirt off

Everyone looks at him

FOX

A very long time ago --

MRS FOX
May I have a word with you privately

FOX

(HESITATES)
Well were in a hole Where --

MRS FOX

deposit Follow me

Fox reluctantly follows Mrs Fox through a crack in the
bedrock and into a small air-pocket with glittering quartz
walls She wheels on Fox

MRS FOX
Im going to lose my temper now

FOX
(PAUSE)
When
MRS FOX
Right now

(PAUSE)
Well when --

Mrs Fox scratches Fox across the face slicing a quick
sliver into his fur Fox cringes away with his paws up
protectively He lowers his paws His eyes fill with tears
(NOTE the scar in Foxs fur never grows back)

Mrs Fox takes a deep breath She says

MRS FOX
Twelve fox-years ago you made a promise
to me while we were caged inside that fox-
trap that if we survived you would

never steal another chicken goose
turkey duck or squab whatever they

are I believed you Why did you lie to
me

FOX

(SIMPLY)
Because Im a wild animal

MRS FOX
Youre also a husband and a father

FOX

(PAINED)
Im trying to tell you the truth about
myself
MRS FOX
I dont care about the truth about
yourself

Fox looks down at the ground He nods and tries to contain
his emotions Mrs Fox watches him coldly

MRS FOX
This story is too predictable

FOX
(SURPRISED)
Predictable Really What happens in the
end
MRS FOX
(QUIETLY)
In the end we all die -- unless you

change
Mrs Fox walks out of the air-pocket Fox stands alone in
silence

Full of wit n grace n charm

The shot moves past the leathery faces of the other

as they listen amused moved hungry tired charmed
annoyed whistling playing a jews harp trying to sing
along but not really knowing the words etc

Like any little critter needin
Vittels for his littluns
Well he stole and he cheated

And he lied to survive

had our hero on the run
Shot the tail off the cuss

Dug as quick as a gopher

Theyre a-settin up there still

enormous youth over his shoulder and into the mud Beavers

paws move abruptly around in the air drawing lines and
shapes He freezes and looks straight up at the ceiling of
the tunnel He snaps the fingers of his paw and looks to the
others He says with a cautious excitement

FOX
Ive got an idea

BADGER

(TENTATIVELY)
What is it

FOX
It could be a good one

FOX
It might save our lives

Fox looks down at Ash who stands beside him with mud still
on his mouth He nods He says suddenly

FOX

Fox grips Mrs Foxs paw He looks into her eyes and says

INTENSELY

FOX

Mrs Fox detects a special familiar inspired light in her
husbands eyes at this moment She nods She hands Ash the
lantern She straightens the neck-line of his cape licks

mud off Ashs snout and scrambles away down Badgers
Ash wants to cry but does not Fox turns to the others

FOX
Gentlemen this time we must dig in a
very special direction
Fox feels the walls with his paws Everyone watches
attentively

FOX
I got to kind of feel out the vibe
Fox stops He points slightly downwards and due south He
says with quiet anticipation
at

FOX
Begin
Everyone starts digging slowly but intently

CUT TO
The diggers one hundred yards later Fox suddenly whistles
and raises his fist
The diggers stop digging Fox feels the ceiling with his
paws He knocks something hard It sounds hollow He looks

the others with a funny expression and raises an eyebrow
Fox carefully pushes up a floorboard It creaks loudly They
all duck down and wait Nothing happens Fox pushes up a
second floorboard He cautiously pokes his head up through

the gap He lets out a shriek of excitement and whispers
excitedly down to the others

FOX
Ive done it Ive done it first time
Come up and see where you are my
darlings
Everyone scrambles up out of the tunnel

INT SHED NIGHT

Everyone stands in the middle of Boggis Chicken House 1
The room is teeming with chickens which stare at them
nervously There are black chickens white chickens brown

INT FLINT-MINE DAY

The flint-mine is a large but cozy space with stone walls a
dirt floor a small kitchen and a fireplace There are rows
of cots sleeping bags boxes blankets and suitcases for
all the refugee animals All the animals have gathered
together and drink cider cocktails while small rabbits
skunks and field mice set the table The room is festooned
with garlands A well-dressed mole smoking a pipe plays the
piano A bespectacled rabbit leans against it humming a
tune
Weasel stands in the corner talking with Beaver

WEASEL
What am I going to do Im going to hold
him to the terms of the contract Its
not my fault they uprooted it
Kristofferson serves cranberry punch from a tureen in the
corner Ash goes over to him and holds out a mug

ASH
They say I owe you an apology for some of
the mean things I said about your
fathers illness His double-pneumonia or
whatever theyre calling it now
Kristofferson ladles Ash a cupful

KRISTOFFERSON
OK

ASH
So there it is I hope we can continue
our relationship as cousins or family
members or however you want to define

It --
(suddenly more intense)
-- but do me a favor for yourself The
next time you have a problem with
something Ive said come to me as a fox

ASH (CONTD)
and lets deal with it right then and not
let it blow up into a whole huge thing
involving parents and so on Agreed
Ash drinks his punch in one long sip and holds out the empty
mug for a refill Kristofferson nods slowly He points at
Ash
with his ladle

KRISTOFFERSON
Im going to teach you karate
Badger sits next to the fireplace with Fox and Kylie

BADGER
I can imagine how painful even just
emotionally that must be for you

FOX

(UNEASY)
Well you know its not the end of the
world

BADGER

(MORE ANIMATED)
Oh but Foxy how humiliating Having
your whole tail blown clean off by a --

FOX

(COOLY)

Kristofferson starts to refill Ashs mug again Ash suddenly
puts his paw over the brim Kristofferson hesitates Ash
raises an eyebrow and says mysterriously

ASH
Ever tasted one of Mrs Beans famous
nutmeg-ginger-apple snaps

EXT CAMP DAY

A large fire truck drives up to the destroyed hill with
firemen hanging off the back and sides It parks among the
tractors and tents The chief in a white helmet goes over

INT FLINT-MINE DAY

Candles glow all around Everyone is seated at the long
dining room table and a magnificent feast with every

of fruit meat vegetable and roasted bird has been laid

in front of them They tear into their meals eating and
drinking ferociously Crumbs juices blood and bones fly
into the air Jaws snap and chew There is no conversation
Badger suddenly stands and rings a knife against his cider
glass Everyone looks up taking a breather from the frenzy
of eating Badger clears his throat

BADGER
Well it took a near-catastrophe for all
of you to finally take me up on my offer
to have you over to the flint-mine for
dinner but I guess we have --

FOX

(INTERRUPTING)
Im sorry Maybe my invitation got lost
in the mail Does anybody know what this
badgers talking about
Everyone laughs Fox sits at the opposite end of the table
with a crooked smile on his face

FOX
But Clives right --

Fox raises his cider glass Badger reluctantly sits back
down

FOX
I guess we do have those three ugly
cusshole farmers to thank for one thing

its side A fireman slides a thick hose deep into the

He looks behind him and nods

The shot moves backwards along the hose past seven more
firemen signalling to each other with a thumbs-up a snap

Ash and Kristofferson crouched under a drain-cover pushed
just-open next to a refrigerator They peer out across a
bright clean white kitchen at a plate of perfect golden
They

step-

cookies on a counter-top next to an open window with a step-
ladder directly in front of it They look at each other

look around the quiet empty room Ash shrugs
Ash and Kristofferson dart out leaving the drain-cover
propped-up They race over the linoleum They climb the

ladder and stop at the plate Ash swoons and says
RAPTUROUSLY

ASH
Theyre still warm
Ash and Kristofferson gather more cookies than they can
possibly carry eating as they collect them Crumbs go
everywhere
On the other side of the room the drain-cover falls shut
with a loud clank Ash and Kristofferson look up wildly
startled All at once they hear in a simultaneous cacophony
the back door bursting open a boy and two beagles shouting
and barking the pantry door slamming Mrs Bean and her

middle-aged housekeeper clanging pots and pans and arguing

timer on the counter-top ringing and a raven fluttering to
the windowsill and cawing

Ash and Kristofferson panic silently They drop the cookies
and fly down the step-ladder

CUT TO
Fox in mid-toast

FOX
Ive stepped on some toes and alienated a
few of you over the past few days -- but

is it wrong for me to suggest we mightve
done worse than having an incredible
banquet in a beautiful flint-mine
surrounded by our favorite animals Look
at each other Here we are Wow Now Ive
already had too much to drink and Im
feeling sentimental but Im going to say
something anyway which nobody wants to

chicken their sizzling duck their
succulent turkey their foie gras de --

(SUDDENLY)
Whered the boys go Ash Kristofferson
(to Mrs Fox)
What am I hearing again baby Whats
happening Am I still paranoid
There is a low distant rumbling which rapidly builds to a
deafening roar Everyone waits frozen A single drop of
water drips from the ceiling into Badgers water glass Fox
turns to Badger and says

FOX
Lets pause again
A wild deluge smashes into the room flooding the flint-mine
and tunnels with a blasting current that sweeps everyone and
everything away chaotically

CUT TO
The entire party of well-dressed animals and their plates
furniture chickens etc shooting down the tunnel with the
rushing waters Fox helpless holding his breath looks to
the others underwater Badger shakes his head in disgust
Rabbit makes a fierce grimace Mole bares his teeth
ferociously Beaver rants angrily with bubbles coming out

his mouth and Kylie stares ahead vacantly holding his

Fox turns sadly to Mrs Fox She looks terrified

INT SEWER SYSTEM NIGHT

The flood blasts out of a wide pipe rocketing the animals
into a murky brick cavern with drainpipes on all sides and
three inches of black water on its floor Fox picks himself
up dazed and scared and looks around at his soaked friends
and their families
buddy

FOX
What the cuss just happened Something
with water That was dangerous Is anyone
hurt

BADGER

(FURIOUS )
Were all hurt My entire flint-mine just
got demolished

FOX
Lets do a head-count Everybody pick a
buddy
Each animal turns to his neighbor and establishes their

relationship Fox looks wildly agitated as his eyes dart
about searching He shouts

FOX
Whered the boys go Ash Kristofferson
Ashs voice cracks on the other side of the cavern

ASH
Im here
Everyone turns to see Ash standing at the mouth of a smaller
pipe He looks devastated and terrified Fox points to him

FOX
Ash Whos your buddy

ASH
Kristofferson but I lost him

FOX
You lost him Where were you

ASH

We went for cookies
Everyone turns to Fox Fox yells desperately

FOX
holds

down

Kristofferson

Fox sprints around the cavern splashing digging and
ducking in and out of tunnels as the others join his frantic
search His voice sounds pained as he shouts

FOX
Kristofferson Kristofferson
Kristofferson

CUT TO

The three farmers standing next to the fire truck Bean

a soaked half-conscious Kristofferson up in the air by the
tail Kristofferson is quietly crying

BEAN
Wrap this wet little mutt in a newspaper
and put him in a box with some holes
punched in the top

INT SEWER SYSTEM NIGHT

Everyone has gathered together They are all in a state of
shock Fox turns to Mrs Fox beside him

FOX
Your brothers going to kill me if he
survives his double-pneumonia
Beaver runs into the brick cavern out of a drainpipe

SHOUTING

BEAVER
Theres only one way out of this sewer
but the manhole covers closed and
theres a station-wagon parked on it --
which means were permanently stuck down
here

BADGER

(BITTERLY)
You still think we beat em Foxy
Everyone turns to Fox and stares at him coldly Fox sits

on the floor in the water He says quietly
FOX

Somebody take over Im not in charge
anymore
on

Everyone looks around at each other They dont know
do Mrs Fox sits down in the water next to Fox

FOX
You told me to change but I cant --

(REALIZING)

think I just did

MRS FOX

(PAUSE)
Well then maybe were not all going to
die

Fox looks to Mrs Fox He stands up suddenly He takes Mrs

Foxs hand

FOX
Excuse us everyone

Fox leads Mrs Fox over to a ledge near a cement waterfall

the far side of the brick cavern He puts his arm around her

waist

FOX
Badgers right These farmers arent
going to quit until they catch me I
shouldnt have lied to your face I
shouldnt have resigned slash gotten
fired from the Gazette I shouldnt have
pushed these farmers so far and tried to
embarrass them and cuss with their heads
I enjoyed it but I shouldnt have done
it -- and now theres only one way out
Maybe if I hand myself over and let them
kill me stuff me and hang me over their

MANTELPIECE --
MRS FOX

(ICILY)
Youll do no such thing
FOX

(QUIETLY)
Darling maybe theyll let everyone else
live
Mrs Fox stares at Fox She says desolately

MRS FOX
Whyd you have to get us into this Foxy

FOX
I dont know but I have a possible
theory I think I have this thing where I
need everybody to think Im the greatest
-- the quote-unquote fantastic Mr Fox --
and if they arent completely knocked-
out dazzled and kind of intimidated by
me then I dont feel good about myself
Mrs Fox shakes her head and turns away Fox continues

FOX
Foxes traditionally like to court danger
hunt prey and outsmart predators -- and

thats what Im actually good at I
think at the end of the day Im just --

MRS FOX

(QUIETLY)
Were wild animals
Fox smiles sadly and nods He shrugs

FOX
I guess we always were I promise you if
I had all this to do over again Id have
never let you down It was always more
fun when we did it together anyway
Mrs Fox has tears all over her face Fox kisses her He
whispers in her ear

FOX
I love you Felicity

MRS FOX

I love you too but I shouldnt have

married you

Mrs Fox turns and walks away Fox stares after her He goes
over to Ash

FOX
Did I ever tell you about the time I
learned we were going to have a cub

ASH
In the fox-trap

FOX
Right We were at gun-point and your

MOTHER --

ASH
-- says shes pregnant

FOX
Let me tell it OK I had no idea how we
were going to get out of this jam and
then it hit me what do foxes do better
than any other animal

ASH
Dig

FOX
Youre stepping on my lines

ASH
Keep telling it

FOX
So we dug And the whole time I put paw
over paw scooping dirt and pebbles with
your mother digging like crazy beside me
I kept wondering who is this little boy
going to be

ASH
Or girl

FOX
Or girl right -- because at that point
we didnt know
Fox grabs Ash by his shoulders and looks him in the eye

FOX
Ash Im so glad he was you
Fox hugs Ash tightly holds him for an instant then lets
go He turns to the group

FOX
Badger organize a search party and try
to find Kristofferson Maybe hes alive
Im sorry everyone I wish --

(HESITATES)
Well good-bye
Fox looks across the cavern to Mrs Fox standing with her
back to him She turns to face him Her eyes are burning
Fox
smiles sadly He races away down the drain-pipe Everyone
watches him disappear Badger hesitates He addresses the

GROUP UNCERTAINLY

BADGER
I guess we should probably split into a
certain number of groups and start doing
something right

INT CONDUIT NIGHT

Fox sprints full-speed in the darkness His claws scratch
rattling along the iron floor and splash through puddles of
shallow water

Fox stops suddenly He stands up tall on his hind legs His
ears perk up One pins back He listens

CUT TO
Badger carrying a lantern leading Ash Mole and two small
rabbits down a drainpipe Badger calls out

BADGER
Kristofferson Hello Can you hear us
Rats voice echoes in the darkness

RAT
Yall lookin for somethin Nothin down
here but rusty bottle-caps and drainin
water
Everyone stops short Rat drops into the pipe from an
overhead drain ahead of them He says ominously

RAT
They got the boy

BADGER

(FROZEN)
Whos got him

RAT
The farmers three You know who Im
talkin about

BADGER

(HESITATES)
Theyve kidnapped him

RAT
Well-done Mr Badger Youre a smart
man They want to trade the son for his

it He opens it Kylie looks over his shoulder Badger
frowns

BADGER
Whyd they write this in letters cut out
of magazines

KYLIE
To protect their identities
(on second thought)
Oh right but then whyd they sign their
names Plus we already knew who they
were because theyre trying to kill us

INSERT
A ransom note written in letters cut out of magazines and
pasted onto a piece of paper Badger reads out loud
Mr Fox we have your son If you
ever want to see him alive again --
Ash calls out

ASH
Im his son
Everyone looks at Ash He stands behind them in silhouette
Rat says darkly

RAT
I can see the resemblance
Pause In an instant Rat grabs Ash by the tail picks him

off the ground swings him in the air and flings him away
twenty feet down the drainpipe Badger looks stunned

Ash sits in a puddle in a stupor Rat races toward him down
the tunnel He leaps into the air with his claws out and his
teeth bared As he is about to seize upon Ash -- he is
suddenly jerked backwards and spun around

Rat is face to face with Fox Fox strikes his old-fashioned
boxing stance He draws back and throws a hard punch

Rat square in the jaw Rat staggers stunned He swings his
switchblade cutting Fox across the chest

Fox touches the wound and looks at the blood on the fingers
of his paw He looks to Rat Rat holds up his wrist and

Fox a childs plastic digital watch with miniature

baseballs and soccer balls on it He says strangely

RAT
Ive still got it

FOX

(FROWNING)
Whatd you just say

RAT

I said Ive still got the watch Mr Fox

She never asked for it back

A frozen moment Fox springs forward and clamps his jaws
onto

Rats throat Rat tumbles over backwards Fox pins him to
the

ground with his teeth in Rats neck Rat kicks and bucks and

struggles but Fox holds him fast Rat goes limp Fox

releases him

Everyone slowly gathers around Fox and Rat Ash kneels next

to his father Fox cradles Rat in his arms Rat whispers

RAT
The boys locked in an apple crate on top
of a gun-locker in the attic of Bean
Annex Its a set-up

FOX

(SADLY)
Would you have told me if I didnt kill
you first
Rat smiles sickly Blood drips from his mouth His voice

CREAKS

RAT
Never

FOX
(shaking his head)
All these wasted years What were you
looking for Rat
Fox wipes the blood from Rats chin Rat mutters

ASH
Hes trying to say something Dad
Fox leans his ear close to Rats mouth As quiet as a mouse

RAT WHISPERS

Cider

Fox nods He looks around the drainpipe He cups his paw

the pool of murky water and holds it to Rats lips

FOX
Here you are Rat A beaker of Beans
finest secret cider
Rats slivery scratchity long pink tongue laps up a taste
of the black liquid He licks his lips and says faintly

RAT
Like melted gold
Rats eyes turn into Xs He is dead Ash stands up

ASH
He redeemed himself

FOX

(SHRUGS)
Redemption Sure
Fox swallows and says hopelessly with tears in his eyes

FOX
But in the end -- hes just another dead
rat in a garbage pail behind a Chinese
restaurant
Ash puts his hand on Foxs shoulder Fox lays Rat gently

the sewer floor He stands up and turns to the rest of the
group Badger claps his paws together

BADGER
Well I suppose we should --

FOX

(INTERRUPTING)
Excuse me again B The search partys
been cancelled Were replacing it with a
go-for-broke rescue mission Its a set-
up but maybe we can make it work You
two little rabbits run tell the others

(YELLING)
Now go
The two little rabbits scurry away down the drainpipe
Badger
walks with Fox and Ash

BADGER
What was he saying about that wristwatch
I didnt get what he was talking about

Fox hesitates He shrugs and says with a sad nostalgia

FOX
Just some old back-story

INT SEWER SYSTEM NIGHT

The entire community of animals has reconnoitered in the
brick cavern Fox stands on a large spigot and addresses the
group He has a bandage on his chest

FOX
In a way Im almost glad that flood
interrupted us because I dont like the
toast I was giving Im going to start
over
Fox pantomimes raising a long-stemmed glass

FOX
When I look down this table with the
exquisite feast set before us I see two
terrific lawyers a skilled pediatrician
a wonderful chef a savvy real-estate
agent an excellent tailor a crack
accountant a gifted musician a pretty
good minnow fisherman and possibly the
best landscape painter working on the
scene today
As Fox describes them the shot cuts to Badger and Beaver
Mrs Badger Rabbit Weasel an especially small waifish
field mouse Mole Kylie (who looks slightly offended) and
Mrs Fox respectively

FOX
Maybe a few of you might even read my
column from time to time Who knows I
tend to doubt it

(DRAMATIC PAUSE)
I also see a room full of wild animals
Everyone stares at Fox curiously skeptical but intrigued
Fox points at them

FOX

Wild animals with true natures and pure
talents Wild animals with scientific-—
sounding Latin names that mean something
about our DNA Wild animals each with
his own strengths and weaknesses due to
his or her species and also -- well I
guess these things usually have a lot to

(MORE )

FOX (CONTD)
do with the parents as we all know
Anyway I think it may very well be all
the beautiful differences among us that
just might give us the tiniest glimmer of
a chance of saving my nephew and letting
me make it up to you for getting us into
this crazy whatever-it-is I dont know
Its just a thought Thank you for
listening Cheers everyone
Fox motions with his imaginary glass and pantomimes drinking
it A few of the others reluctantly pantomime drinking Fox
finishes his glass and pantomimes throwing it on the floor
He makes a smashing-glass sound Kylie shouts

Mrs Fox puts the finishing touches on a vast mural painted

on the longest tallest wall of the brick cavern She stands

on a ladder Her sleeves are rolled up and she is
splattered

with twelve different colors of paint She looks down to Fox

EXT STREET DAY

An old craftsman looks out from the window of Ferguson
Cobblers as he taps little nails into the heel of a loafer

station-wagon with wood-grain side-panels and a flat tire
sits parked on a manhole cover in front of the shop Boggis
Bunce and five armed farmhands watch as Bean monkeys with a
slim-jim until he gets the car door jimmied

Bean hops inside He starts the engine puts his arm over

top of the seat as he looks back out the rear window and

into the woods Fox says wistfully
