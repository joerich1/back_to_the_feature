The building block fortress comes crasbing down Roar
A rocket powered machine spins around ths corner and smasbes
into the plastic Indiane He is deeply immersed in thie
battle as the mismatched forces rags to and fro when
suddenly the mood ie broken by his MOTHER’e voice from
downstairs

RANDALL
Thats it Og well show ‘em
we can do something right

They work well and go into action methodically OG is

already studying the lock he grabs KEVIN’s bag and
rummagee through OGs eyes light up He roots out
ths knife the Greek King gave him KEVIN tries to etop
him but realieing it’s for the cause he reluctantly
lets OG take it

OG slips it into the lock and with much hending and twisting
which from KEVIN’s rsactione we see ig giving him heart-
failure the door swings open

OG hands KEVIN his knife back with grin of thanks The end
of the beautiful Greek blade is now twisted like a corkscrew

RANDALL enatches the knife out of KEVIN’s hands and hands it

to FPIDGIT who scramhles up the outside of the now swinging
cage With the knife he hegins to cut off strands from the
supporting hauser He drops them down to WALLY and STRUTTER
who start to braid them Somewhat latsr they have woven a long
thin rope The hauser holding the cage te extremely frayed
The GANG is definitsly working against time - with each
movement of the cage another of the few remaining strands of
the hauser snaps Tying the rope around STRUTTERs waist they
lower him down helow the cage Slowly they hegin to swing him
hack and forth With each swing he ares further out The
hauser continues to part with these exertions At last
STRUTTER hasgained enough momentum ‘and witha final swing

‘he’ reachesthe neighbouring ‘cage Hs clings to the bars as
WALLY is tied to the rope Pulling it taut and checking his
angle of attack WALLY leaps from the cage Gracefully he
arcs under STRUTTERs cage and sweeps over to the next cage
The moment he has firmly grasped itehars STRUTTER lets go

and swings under WALLY and onto solid ground at the edge of the
abyss A cheer goes up from the rest of the GANG

STRUTTER attachee the rope to stone column The other end
is attached to the cage and after WALLY has untied himeel
from the middle of it the rope is pulled taut

One hy one the GANG slides down the rope to the ground

WALLY checks his positioning and fearleesly lets go of the
cage and drops toward the rope Expertly he catches it but
the jolt on the rope snaps the hauser holding the cage and
the cage and rope plummet into the abyes WALLY disappeare
aS well Panic from the GANG MADLY they pull on the rope
Up it comes and eurprise WALLY is dangling on the end

Ye are a nasty lot

Tiddle-eye toh tum

Rum tikki tikki ton

Well all be stinking rich
With a caetle or two

And a mountain view

And a private cricket pitch

Eey-ho nicky-nocky nam

Yum tum tikka eye-lay

Wham Bam Grab it if you can
Who says crime doesnt pay

With our horrihle looks

and our mean little eyes

and our hearts as hard as rock
On We strike terror everywhere
We go

THE END
