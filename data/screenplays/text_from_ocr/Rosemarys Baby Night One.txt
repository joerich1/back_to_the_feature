INT BEDROOM - PARIS - NIGHT

CLOSE on a young woman early twenties a dark hair beauty
but for the streaked mascara and tears running down her
cheeks The haunted look of betrayal etched on her face A
POUNDING on the bedroom door turns her head

JACQUES (0S)
(in French)
Nena unlock this door Let me in
Let me talk to you

NENA
(in French)
All this time I’ve been in a cage

Nena moves to the door and now WE can see if this is her
cage it’s a gilded one

OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

Jacques is distraught He is handsome around the same age
He’s trying to make her understand

JACQUES
(in French)
Let me explain Please

He fumbles with a set of keys finally finding the one he’s
looking for

BEDROOM

The SOUND of a key in the lock the knob turning The door
cracks open Jacques’s hand reaches around the door as Nena
throws her weight against it The door SLAMS on the fingers
crushing them

OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

Jacques SCREAMS as he pulls his hand back Nena jams a chair
against the knob wedging it closed

JACQUES (CONT’D)
(in French)
You can’t stay in there forever

BEDROOM
Nena looks around the truth of his statement fills her with

despair Her eyes erratic now as Jacques begins to RAM his
shoulder against the door - the wood CRACKING
NENA
(softly in French)
No

A sudden determination fills her face She rips a delicate
chain with a small GOLD AMULET off her neck WE SEE the
elaborate ornamentation

NENA (CONTD)
(in French)
Lies all lies

Nena throws the amulet away She begins to quickly take off
her clothes as if finally freeing herself from everything
Another shoulder against the door The door almost giving
way the SOUND of wood splintering

Nena steps naked out onto the balcony the night air billows
the sheers She steps up onto the ledge

NENA (CONTD)
(in French)
I’m free

She tips forward Her body falling into the darkness

EXT RUE CAMBON - NIGHT

The quiet of the night is shattered as the body SLAMS into
the sidewalk

OVERHEAD ANGLE on Nena her dead body in angelic repose
blood spreads in a circle around her head as if surrounding
her in a red halo CAMERA TILTS UP to find the building from
where she leapt Gargoyles on the parapet stand vigil they
appear to watch over the body mockingly

FADE OUT

INT EXAMINATION ROOM - NEW YORK - DAY

The image of an ultrasound fills the screen Black and white
a nightmarish vision of shadow and light Moving as the wand
is moved over a young woman’s stomach

ROSEMARY WOODHOUSE lies on the examination table Her
husband GUY sits in a chair next to her across from DOCTOR
LIBERMAN an elderly OB-GYN

DOCTOR LIBERMAN
So how have you been feeling
ROSEMARY
Good Anxious

DOCTOR LIBERMAN
Has it been three months

GUY
Almost I think we found out she
was pregnant on opening day of the
season Now we’re almost
mathematically out of the playoffs
so yeah

DOCTOR LIBERMAN
Yankees’ fan

ROSEMARY
Mets

The Doctor winces in sympathy He works the wand over her
stomach again jabs a few buttons on the monitor Seems to be
having trouble finding whatever he’s looking for The room
suddenly growing quiet

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
Anything wrong

The Doctor glances up at his patient gives Rosemary a tight
smile He sets the wand back into its holder

DOCTOR LIBERMAN
Give me one second Okay

The Doctor leaves the examination room Rosemary looks over
to Guy with some trepidation

ROSEMARY
Guy I’m scared

Guy takes her hand squeezes it tight

GUY
Let’s not jump to any conclusions
Maybe there’s something wrong with
the machine

ROSEMARY

There’s something wrong with me
GUY

Rosemary
ROSEMARY

I can feel it

The door opens again Doctor Liberman is followed into the
room by another DOCTOR a younger female She smiles at
Rosemary spreads some conducting gel on the wand and places
it on her stomach

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
(a whisper)
Please

The image on the ultrasound screen moves like blackened
waves The Doctor in utter concentration probing moving the
wand in every conceivable orientation Finally she looks up
at Liberman her mouth set in a grim line The female Doctor
turns to the young couple

FEMALE DOCTOR
I’m so sorry We can’t find a
heartbeat

On Rosemary Stoic shock dissolving into grief as the words
begin to sink in Her eyes well with tears Guy is stricken
with emotion He tries to hold it together as Rosemary softly
sobs

INT HALLWAY —- DAY

Guy has an arm wrapped around Rosemary as they walk out of
the examination room They are both devastated

GUY
I don’t know what to say

ROSEMARY
Me neither

Rosemary cries Guy holds her tight helpless in grief
CAMERA PANS with the couple as they move to an exit
REVEALING a dark figure seated in the fg watching them
HOLD on this mysterious stranger Though we can’t see his
face WE can see the ornate head of his cane - a beautifully
carved visage of a gargoyle On this portent

FADE OUT

THREE MONTHS LATER

EXT PARISIAN STREET - DAY

Rosemary walks down a Parisian street following navigation
directions on her phone Three months have blunted the grief
of losing her pregnancy
Her face reflects the sunny beauty of Paris There is a
lightness in her step Carrying a small gift bag Rosemary
looks at her phone turns the corner - into a dead end alley
The young woman stops

PHONE (VO)
You have arrived at your
destination

ROSEMARY

No This is not happening

She checks the screen The blinking dot definitely indicates
she’s there Cafe’ Miro A PASSERBY walks behind her
Rosemary turns

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Excuse me I seem to be lost I’m
looking for Cafe Miro’ on Rue
Geneta Am I even close

The Passerby continues walking as if she doesn’t exist Beat

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Thank you for confirming the
stereotype

Rosemary looks around She pulls up another app on her phone
starts typing furiously before approaching two FRENCHMEN
smoking cigarettes They turn to her She smiles Rosemary
holds up her phone presses play

PHONE
(translation app)
Je suis perdu Pouvez-vous me café
Miro rue Greneta diriger

As the men begin to gesticulate pointing her in the right
direction
EXT CAFE MIRO’ - DAY

Rosemary approaches a woman sitting alone at an outdoor
table As the woman lifts a glass of wine to her lips

ROSEMARY
Jules

JULES turn her face lights up Attractive but blunt she’s
been a friend since college Jules stands and gives Rosemary
a hug Holds her close
JULES
I’m sorry

Rosemary nods Doesn’t want a pity party She sets the gift
bag on the table in front of Jules

ROSEMARY
That’s the last time I want to hear
those words okay This is for you

JULES
No you didn’t

ROSEMARY
For everything you’ve done

JULES
Moi

ROSEMARY
There’s no way Guy would have
gotten the job without you A year
in Paris Teaching at the Sorbonne

JULES
Listen all I did was put his CV
on top of the pile He’s pretty
impressive all on his own By the
way you won’t be thanking me once
you see what they consider faculty
housing

ROSEMARY
We’ve been there It’s fine
Actually it’s perfect It’s just
what we needed

Jules flags down a waiter turns to Rosemary

JULES
White okay
(Rosemary nods)
Un vin blanc sil vous plait

The waiter places a napkin on the table then moves off to
get the wine

JULES (CONTD)
Your husband still writing the
great American Novel

ROSEMARY
Every time I check he’s one
revision away from “The End”
JULES
He’s always been a great writer
Problem is he’s a perfectionist

ROSEMARY
That he is And stubborn And he’s
getting angry about it Maybe Paris
is the push he needs to finally
finish

JULES
What about you

ROSEMARY
(shrugs)
I’m coping I’1l find something
sooner or later

JULES
Well there are plenty of non-
profits around that could use your
help Fundraising is more art than
science

The waiter returns with a glass of wine The two friends
drink Jules reaches out and takes Rosemary’s hand There’s a
genuine closeness between these two

JULES (CONTD)
I’m so happy that you’re here I
want to take care of you Give me a
chance to pay you back for helping
me survive the year of eating
dangerously

Rosemary laughs

JULES (CONTD)
I mean honestly what’s left after
no carbs no fat and no gluten

Rosemary looks around notices some older people glancing
their way She releases her hand from Jules

ROSEMARY
Is it me or do we look like two
lesbians on a date

Jules follows her look sees the older people looking away
JULES

The hell with them And don’t knock
it ‘til you tried it
Beat

ROSEMARY
(scandalized)
Jules

JULES
Just sayin’ So you and Guy are
okay

ROSEMARY
He’s been wonderful Better to me
than I am to myself

JULES
Rosemary It’s nobody’s fault You
know that

ROSEMARY
I know but I can’t help but think
if I didn’t have that glass of
wine or whatever There are a
thousand reasons I can think of to
feel guilty about

JULES
And no reasons at all

ROSEMARY
This is exactly what I didn’t want
to do

JULES
Okay When you two get settled
youll come to my place for dinner
None of this French gourmet crap
I’1l make chicken pot pie that’s
Guy’s favorite

ROSEMARY
That’s right How did you know
that

Jules pauses for half a beat

JULES
Lucky guess Do we have a date

Rosemary nods enthusiastic

ROSEMARY
Absolutely
JULES
You’re so brave Rosemary When I
first moved here it took me a
month before I ventured two blocks
out from my apartment And I know
how to speak French I have a
feeling you’re going to have a
great adventure You deserve one

EXT NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY

Playing tourist for the day Rosemary walks through the plaza
onto a smaller side street She checks her phone mapping her
next adventure totally unaware of her surroundings
Suddenly a GYPSY BOY comes out of nowhere and grabs her
purse Rosemary is yanked off balanced but she manages to
hang on slowing the boy down

He pulls harder nearly separating her arm from the socket
The strap on the purse breaks the boy scrambles away with
Rosemary hot on his trail

ROSEMARY
You little shit Give it back

The boy looks back behind him in disbelief Rosemary is
actually gaining on him The boy weaves through people on the
sidewalk running as fast as he can

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
Stop him He’s got my purse

Nobody moves to help Rosemary is not giving up she weaves
through the crowd only to see the boy running into the
street

The boy glances back at Rosemary a second before a car SLAMS
into him He rolls up onto the hood SMASHING into the
windshield before landing hard on the ground

Rosemary stops short breathless She moves toward the
accident The boy is hidden from sight on the other side of
the car

The DRIVER gets out going around the car He picks up
Rosemary’s purse and a wallet along with some of the
scattered contents Suddenly the boy gets up from the ground
and hobbles away

Rosemary moves to the Driver who hands her the stolen purse
She watches the boy disappearing into the city

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
Is he alright

DRIVER
(in French)
You can’t kill a cockroach

The Driver gets back into his car Rosemary steps aside as he
drives away She picks up a few remaining items on the
ground Lipstick Compact Before moving to the sidewalk

Rosemary looks into her purse Finds her passport Sees the
wallet She takes it out It’s designer chic elegant

ROSEMARY
This isn’t mine

She opens the wallet to see a wad of cash and credit cards

and a picture ID with an address She looks at the picture -
an elegant woman Even her ID photo looks beautiful

Margaux Castevet

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Margaux Castevet This is your
lucky day

EXT RUE CAMBON - DAY

WEVE seen this place before Might recognize it as the same
street where Nena made her desperate suicide In daylight
the street looks magnificent Sparkling clean Surrounded by
grand beautiful buildings Rosemary steps up to an impressive
structure It’s ancient but immaculately maintained
Gargoyles stand watch over the parapet Everything about it
speaks of wealth and power A plaque at the entrance reads
“La Chimere

INT LA CHIME’RE - LOBBY - DAY
Rosemary approaches the concierge PAUL at a front desk He
notes her dress in the way that immediately makes her feel

like she doesn’t belong here He smiles at her perfunctorily

ROSEMARY
Um parlez-vous anglais

PAUL
Oui Yes

ROSEMARY
Great I have a wallet that belongs
to one of your tenants here
Margaux Castevet

Paul holds out his hand

PAUL
I will make sure it is returned to
her
Rosemary hesitates
ROSEMARY

Id rather give this to her myself

PAUL
Youre looking for a reward

ROSEMARY
No I’m not Can you just please
call her Margaux Castevet

MARGAUX (0OS)
My ears are burning Are you
looking for me darling

Rosemary turns to find Margaux in person entering from the
street The picture ID does not do justice to the whirlwind
of elegance and beauty that sweeps before Rosemary

ROSEMARY
I am I have your wallet

MARGAUX
Oh my God I just spent the last
hour with the police A complete
waste of time They had no hopes of
returning it You’re an absolute
angel American

Rosemary nods

MARGAUX (CONTD)
I love Americans You’re so honest
And open Everything can be seen on
the face How did you find this

ROSEMARY
I think we were robbed by the same
thief

MARGAUX

I hope you beat him to a pulp

Margaux opens her wallet Checks the contents

MARGAUX (CONTD)
It’s all here

She takes out a wad of cash tries to hand it to Rosemary who
backs away refusing

MARGAUX (CONTD)
You must take this For your
efforts

ROSEMARY
No I can’t I’m just happy to see
it returned to its rightful owner

MARGAUX
What is your name

ROSEMARY

MARGAUX

like it Very feminine Where are

On Margaux watching her with interest

INT FACULTY HOUSING - NIGHT

Guy is rummaging through the closet while Rosemary tries to
unpack

The one room apartment includes a bed that sits very low to
the ground An area for a small desk a table and a dresser

Rosemary places clothes from a suitcase into the drawers
filling it pretty quickly

ROSEMARY
The drawers are full and I haven’t
even opened the second suitcase

GUY
Good news I just found our
kitchen

Guy comes out of the closet with an old hotplate He looks
for an electric outlet Finds one near the bed He plugs the
hotplate in

GUY (CONT’D)
Which happens to be next to our
bedroom Makes it a cinch to have
breakfast in bed

ROSEMARY
And I thought New York apartments

for a year

Rosemary laughs She moves to him

ROSEMARY

cooking pot He moves to a bag of groceries picking out a
couple of cans

with a slight limp He carries an ornate cane As he extends
a hand to the good Samaritan

MARGAUX

MARGAUX
Down the hall and to the left Next

Rosemary smiles her thanks and walks away

INT LA CHIME’RE - CASTEVET RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rosemary moves down the hallway to another wing of the house
the hubbub of the party receding away She turns the corner
to find a darkened corridor Several closed doors on either
side

Rosemary opens one door then another no bathroom yet She
twists the handle on a third to find

INT LA CHIME’RE - CASTEVET RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Three naked bodies on the bed Two WOMEN and a MAN

intertwined in the act of love The beautiful bodies glisten
in the soft light from the hallway

The three seem to take no notice of Rosemary Her first
instinct is to shut the door in embarrassment but she finds
herself frozen on the spot Watching Growing excited
herself

The woman climbs on top of the man her mouth devouring his
lips as she pushes down on him in ecstasy The man looks over
to the door at Rosemary His blue eyes locked on hers as he
makes love to the woman riding him Rosemary sucks in a
breath completely enthralled

GUY (OS)
There you are

Rosemary turns to see Guy moving towards her with a drink in
his hand

GUY (CONTD)
What are you doing

Rosemary turns back to the room The bed is empty except for
coats and jackets throw there by guests No bodies
Definitely no Blue Eyed Man Rosemary doesn’t quite
understand what happened but her heart is still beating
quickly her breaths shallow from excitement Guy looks into
the room sees the coats and jackets

GUY (CONT’D)
You okay Why’s your face all red

Rosemary moves to her husband and kisses him passionately
The heat of what she saw transferring directly to her lips
She finally pulls away from him Now Guy is breathless and
so very turned on

ROSEMARY
Let’s go home

GUY
Yeah

ROSEMARY

And not to unpack

GUY
No I get it

He takes her hand and pulls her through the hallway on the
way to the front door As they reach the living room with all
the guests Roman steps toward them blocking their path to
the door

GUY (CONT’D)
Roman thank you so much for having
us It’s been an unbelievable
evening and I think it’s about to
get even better

ROMAN
It certainly is Before you leave
I want to present Rosemary a small
token of our appreciation

Roman raises a hand the room quiets - immediately The
effect is so distinct it’s unnerving Rosemary looks around
her the guests are all directing their rapt attention to
Roman

ROMAN (CONTD)

There is nothing more special than
new friends And you know this does
not happen very often but I
consider Rosemary and Guy new
additions to our clan of misfits I
have such wonderful feelings about
our relationship ahead

The guests APPLAUD He turns to his wife

ROMAN (CONT’D)
Margaux

Margaux steps up to Rosemary an elegant white box topped
with a ribbon tied in a bow

MARGAUX
They say one life is not enough to
fully enjoy the pleasures of this
world I’d like to offer you nine
more

Rosemary pulls the ribbon to untie the bow She lifts the lid
to REVEAL a beautiful BLACK SIAMESE CAT Rosemary smiles
delighted

INT FACULTY HOUSING - NIGHT

Guy opens the door to the small one room apartment He
follows Rosemary who enters carrying the cat in her arms
Their living quarters are quite a come down from the opulence
they just experienced
GUY
I know I’m totally going to cock
block myself but what kind of
person gives a live animal as a
gift to total strangers I mean
it’s really less of a gift and more
of an obligation

ROSEMARY
I think she’s beautiful What
should we name her

GUY
No name There’s no way we can keep
this cat

Rosemary fills a bowl with water for the cat She nuzzles the

animal

ROSEMARY
Come on Look at this face

GUY
There’s not enough room here for
the two of us And I doubt the
university will allow animals in
the building

Guy begins to disrobe tossing his jacket and tie onto a

chair

Guy laughs Rosemary turns to Guy to unzip her

GUY (CONTD)
We can keep the cat through the
night find a good home for her in
the morning

ROSEMARY
What did you think of them

GUY
Well I don’t want to speak ill of
my fellow clan’s men with a “c”
But I find Roman to be one of the
most arrogant opinionated men I’ve
ever met And that’s just the part
I like

ROSEMARY
He’s not lacking for confidence

to take off their clothes

They continue

GUY
No He’s got enough ego for both of
us and the cat
(beat)
He’d make a great character

ROSEMARY
Put him in your book

GUY
Yeah but that would mean I’d have
to speak to him again

ROSEMARY
I like Margaux

Rosemary folds her dress carefully She moves around the room
in her bra and panties putting her clothes away Guy watches
her as he takes off his pants tosses them aside He reaches
for her arm and pulls her close
GUY
Hey what got you so hot and
bothered there tonight

She blushes thinking about it Rosemary leans in and kisses
her husband seductively

ROSEMARY
Do you want to analyze it or do
something about it

He unhooks her bra

GUY
I pick the latter

ROSEMARY
You talk too much

They kiss again Growing heated The two fall back into the
bed Guy buries himself in her neck Rosemary MOANS
passionately As they begin to make love
On the cat watching them with unblinking eyes

FADE OUT
OVER BLACK

The cat HISSES Urgent

INT FACULTY HOUSING - LATER

CLOSE ON Rosemary’s eyes They’re closed in slumber Another
HISS from the cat before a paw bats at Rosemary’s cheek

Rosemary’s eyes open like tiny slits awakened by the cat
ROSEMARY’S POV - THE CAT

Sitting right on her chest Her face inches away from
Rosemary The cat bats Rosemary’s cheek again

ROSEMARY
What

Rosemary’s eyes focus beyond the cat’s face The ceiling
appears to be wavering undulating

Rosemary sits up knocking the cat off her chest She COUGHS
realizes now the room is filling with thick black smoke She
pushes at her husband

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Guy Wake up

Guy groggily opens his eyes as Rosemary begins COUGHING
violently He looks over to the outlet where he had plugged
in the hotplate Smoke is pouring from the inside Guy moves
to the outlet just as sparks explode from it The sparks
ignite the sheet catching on fire And suddenly Guy is
engulfed in flames On Rosemary’s blood curdling SCREAM

END ACT TWO

ACT THREE

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - BURN UNIT - NIGHT

Rosemary sits alone in the empty hallway Next to her on the
chair is a box the same one that held the cat from the
Castevets A BURN PATIENT is wheeled on a gurney past
Rosemary MOANING in pain his face and body disfigured

Rosemary looks up locks eyes with the Patient She quickly
looks away her eyes tearing imagining this fate for Guy A
SCRATCHING from inside the box draws her attention Rosemary
pops the lid up The cat is inside

ROSEMARY
Shhh Keep quiet just a little
longer

NURSE (0S)

Est-il un animal dans la boite

Rosemary looks up busted She tries to bluff her way
through

ROSEMARY
Sorry I don’t speak French Pas
parle frangais

NURSE
No animals allowed in the hospital
If you want to wait the animal has
to go outside

ROSEMARY
Please my husband is in the burn
unit I can’t leave her alone

outside

NURSE
Then I am going to ask both of you
to leave

Rosemary stands flustered Roman and Margaux hurry down the
hallway to her

ROMAN
Quel est le probléme

Roman guides the Nurse away from Rosemary and Margaux
MARGAUX

We came as soon as we heard Is he
hurt badly
ROSEMARY
I don’t know They haven’t told me
anything How did you find out we
were here

MARGAUX
Commissioner Fountain said the
police responded to an accident at
your residence We want to make
sure you’re okay

ROSEMARY
I’m fine It’s Guy There was
something wrong with the hotplate
It shorted out or something and
everything caught on fire Guy was
burned

Rosemary breaks down traumatized Margaux wraps her arm
around the young woman trying to comfort her

MARGAUX
We’re here now I’ve already
started a prayer for him

Roman returns to them shaking his head

ROMAN
There is no talking to a woman with
a little power You wait here with
Rosemary I’1l bring the cat
outside

ROSEMARY
Take care of No Name She woke me
up She saved our lives

MARGAUX
You named her “No Name”

ROSEMARY
Actually Guy did

ROMAN

(dry)
For a writer he has quite the
imagination

Roman picks up the box as DOCTOR CORTE comes out of the
examination room

DOCTOR CORTE
Mrs Woodhouse I have news about
your husband

ROSEMARY
(scared)
How is he

DOCTOR CORTE
From your description of the
accident I expected much greater
trauma Your husband suffered
second degree burns on his back and
his chest but he seems to have
escaped any permanent damage He
should be released within the hour

ROSEMARY
Oh my God that’s great news Thank
you Doctor

The Doctor walks away Rosemary turns to the Castevets
beaming with relief and joy

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
It’s a miracle

MARGAUX
Never underestimate the power of my
prayer

Rosemary throws her arms around Margaux Roman looks on with
a smile

ROSEMARY
I feel like I’ve been ripped apart
and sewn back together again Thank
you for being here

ROMAN
What will you do for housing Your
home is clearly uninhabitable

ROSEMARY
I haven’t even thought about that

MARGAUX
There’s an empty apartment in the
building Directly below us

ROSEMARY
I don’t know if you realize how
much an English professor makes in
a month but we couldn’t afford the
rent in your building for a
weekend

MARGAUX
We own it We charge whatever we
like

ROMAN

We get nothing now because it sits
empty You pay us the same rent as
your housing allowance and it’s a
profit

Rosemary is stunned by the offer

ROSEMARY
That’s insane I mean it’s way too
generous

MARGAUX

It’s not about the money Rosemary
It’s about people You need this
We’re here to help

INT LA CHIME’RE - WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - DAY

Guy gingerly carries the last box of their belongings into
the luxuriously furnished apartment He moves a little
stiffly from his recent injuries Some evidence of his burn
can be seen peeking out from his undershirt but he otherwise
looks in perfect health He puts the box down starts to
unpack their meager belongings which feel completely out of
place in this opulent room

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - DAY

Rosemary stands in the same place where we last saw the
frantic Nena in the opening soaking in the vibration of the
room She runs her hand over the furniture sits on the bed
Rosemary steps out onto the balcony looks over the ledge
where Nena jumped to her death A feeling of unease comes
over her

Rosemary comes back into the bedroom She is drawn to a door
Tension as the girl moves to it reaching for the knob CLOSE

ON the knob turning CLICK as the door opens

WE don’t see what she sees but her face is frozen in shock

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Rosemary comes out of the bedroom with a strange intense
look on her face Guy turns to her puzzled

ROSEMARY
Guy you have to see this

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - CLOSET - DAY

The light turns on REVEALING a bedroom size walk in closet
The room is filled with clothes His on one side hers on the
other

GUY
This is unexpected

They move inside checking out the finery Suits Shirts
Dresses Coats A complete wardrobe Guy pulls a suit coat
from a hanger puts it on

GUY (CONTD)
Perfect fit

Rosemary holds a dress up against her body

ROSEMARY
This can’t be for us

GUY
Either that or the last tenants
were exactly our size

ROSEMARY
These clothes are new

Rosemary pulls open a drawer Lingerie and underwear

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
It’s a little creepy right

Guy holds up a piece of sheer nothing

GUY
I don’t know maybe you could try
this on for kicks

Rosemary gives him a look

GUY (CONTD)
I’m kidding Sort of

ROSEMARY
Seriously I’m sure it was done
with good intentions but it’s too
much

GUY
Look this is temporary We don’t
have to use anything they give us
We wear our own clothes eat our
own food When everything settles
down we’ll find our own place

Guy kisses her steps out of the closet to return to
unpacking Like a diabetic in a candy store Rosemary looks
wistfully around her She reaches out for a beautiful scarf
runs the fabric against her finger

EXT SORBONNE - DAY

The same scarf wrapped around Rosemary’s neck as she walks
onto the campus She still has her “regular” wardrobe except
for the finery keeping her warm on this brisk day Rosemary
carries a small hamper - lunch for her and Jules

Up ahead Jules sits waiting smoking a cigarette She sees
Rosemary snubs out her smoke and gives our girl a hug

JULES
It’s about time you came to visit
me I was jonesing for my Rosemary
fix

They start walking through the beautiful campus

ROSEMARY
It’s been crazy With the accident
and moving I spent the last week
trying to organize the new place
find some local store we can
afford I swear everything cost
double where we live

JULES
Youre living with the point zero
zero one percent It’s a whole
different world

ROSEMARY

Well we certainly don’t belong
JULES

Did Guy tell you I put him up for a

new job

Rosemary shakes her head

JULES (CONTD)
The post opened up when one of our
professors suddenly “retired” with
a co-ed to one of those clothing
optional islands in Greece

ROSEMARY
What’s the position

JULES
Ironically teaching Romanticism

Jules smiles and waves at a passing Professor who gives her
a curt nod back The man looks rather stern like if he
smiled his skin would crack This is PROFESSOR FUCHS

JULES (CONTD)
That’s Guy’s main competition
Professor Ludwig Fuchs

ROSEMARY
(laughs)
Sounds severe

JULES
Yeah And he walks like he’s got a
stick up his ass Very well
published though It’d be a lot
more money plus the prestige

ROSEMARY
Guy doesn’t care about money He
wants to start writing again I
think he’s had writer’s block since
the miscarriage

JULES
He needs a new muse I’d watch out
for the co-eds

ROSEMARY
I’m not worried

JULES
You’re that confident

ROSEMARY
No I checked them out before the
term started Didn’t see his type

Jules laughs

JULES
Your husband never had a wandering
eye Not after he met you

ROSEMARY
Youre sweet

JULES
Where should we eat There are the
benches by the garden Or if it’s
too cold we can go to my office

Rosemary looks across the campus she stops Furrows her
brow

ROSEMARY’S POV - CAMPUS

Guy and Roman are in an animated discussion It looks like
Roman is doing most of the talking

RETURN

ROSEMARY
Let’s go to your office

Jules leads the way Rosemary fingers her scarf suddenly
feeling guilty about wearing it

JULES
Hey I like your scarf

ROSEMARY
You do Here take it

Rosemary puts her scarf on Jules who is pleasantly surprised

JULES
I like your husband

Rosemary gives her a sharp look
JULES (CONTD)
What You’re not wearing anything
else I want
Rosemary laughs She turns back to look across campus Guy
and Roman sit close together Conspiratorial

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Guy and Rosemary asleep in bed Rosemary tosses and turns
uncomfortable in her skin Her eyes suddenly open

CLOSE - ROSEMARY

Eyes unfocused staring into a middle space Rosemary appears
to be in a trance She rises from bed

WIDER

In a diaphanous nightgown Rosemary steps to the balcony
doors In a somnambulant state she reaches out and opens the
door

A breeze rustles the sheers Her nightgown lifted by the air
BALCONY LEDGE

Rosemary steps up onto the ledge She sways dangerously The
traffic below her appears miles away As she stands over the
precipice her eyes seem to clear Rosemarys expression
grows tight with fear She loses her balance and tips
forward And suddenly she is falling

As the ground rushes toward her

BEDROOM

Rosemary WAKES with a start Disoriented she looks wildly
around her Guy is obliviously asleep In the darkness two

green glows draw her attention

It’s the cat No Name The animal stares at Rosemary
unmoving a silent sentinel

Rosemary moves to the elevator presses the call button As
she waits she turns and sees Paul watching her After a
moment he looks away

ROSEMARY (CONTD)

PAUL
(confused)
Tabs

ROSEMARY
Comings and goings

PAUL
I try to know who is in the
building Oui So I can help

ROSEMARY
So not just me right

Paul smiles solicitous

PAUL
You are a very special resident
But of course everyone in the
building is special

Rosemary nods now feeling rather foolish The elevator doors
open

ROSEMARY

PAUL
If you require anything at all I
am at your service

Rosemary steps into the elevator On Paul who watches her
stoically as the doors close

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rosemary pushes open the door takes a couple of steps into
the apartment

ROSEMARY
Hello

ROSEMARY’S POV - THE APARTMENT
Silent and still
ROSEMARY

Hear a NOISE She moves through the living room walking down
the hallway past her bedroom

Margaux suddenly appears from one of the back rooms holding
No Name Rosemary tenses

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
Margaux Is anything wrong

Out of the bedroom doorway behind her a large figure
appears Rosemary senses danger turns

ROSEMARY’S POV - A LARGE MAN

Moves toward her Rosemary startles She stumbles backwards
dropping the groceries to the ground The man opens his
mouth an inhuman GUTTURAL NOISE emits from his dark cavity
Rosemary freaks Margaux steps forward to calm her

MARGAUX
No cause for concern Rosemary
This is Emile the handy man for
the building Forgive his lack of
eloquence Emile was born without a
tongue

EMILE GRUNTS an affirmation

ROSEMARY
What the hell is he doing here I
didn’t ask for a handyman

MARGAUX
It’s my fault We had an issue with
our fireplace upstairs I thought
we should check yours while he was
engaged

Margaux turns to Emile

MARGAUX (CONTD)
Did you find anything

Emile shakes his head GRUNTS a negative

MARGAUX (CONTD)
Thank you Emile Please send the
bill to us

Emile lumbers away Rosemary is still amped

ROSEMARY
Id really appreciate it if you
asked me first before you bring
anybody into my home

MARGAUX
I apologize but I thought my
husband had informed your husband
yesterday

Beat Now Rosemary is embarrassed

ROSEMARY
I’m sorry Guy forgot to tell me

MARGAUX
So now we’re both sorry

Rosemary rubs the back of her neck with her hand

ROSEMARY
He gave me a fright I have such a
headache right now

Margaux releases No Name to the floor steps closer to the
girl

MARGAUX
Here let me

Margaux leads her by the hand into the bedroom makes her lay
down on the bed It’s not overtly sexual but there is a
seduction there

ROSEMARY
What are you doing

Margaux climbs onto the bed sitting down near her head
Margaux cradles Rosemary’s face in her hands moving them so
very gently before taking her earlobes between her thumbs and
forefingers She squeezes the lobes as her remaining fingers
pushes into Rosemary’s temple The girl feels the effects
immediately

MARGAUX
I learned this in Tibet For all
our hubris so much ignorance
remains in Western healing

Rosemary looks up at Margaux whose face is upside down to
her At this angle Margaux looks slightly demonic

MARGAUX (CONTD)
Close your eyes

Rosemary does so

MARGAUX (CONTD)
Take a deep breath Hold it in your
chest Now exhale Slowly

Rosemary expels the air from her lungs She opens her eyes

ROSEMARY
My headache is gone

Margaux smiles The two women remain on the bed intimately
close Margaux bends down and softly kisses Rosemary on the
forehead The moment is fraught with sexual tension Beat
Margaux breaks it - she extends her legs and climbs off

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
What can I do to thank you

MARGAUX
You can wear one of the dresses in
your closet I spent a lot of time
picking them

Margaux smiles

MARGAUX (CONTD)
You relax I’1l let myself out

Rosemary lies back on the bed her head spinning from the
encounter A nagging idea invades her thoughts She lifts her
head up from the bed Looks around the bedroom the same room
Emile came out of

ROSEMARY
There’s no fireplace in here

EXT SORBONNE - NIGHT

After a day of classes Guy walks across campus to the Metro
station His bag slung over his shoulder he looks more like
one of the students than a teacher

As he is about to join the crowd into the underground a
black limousine pulls up to the curb A window rolls down

ROMAN
Guy can I offer you a lift

Guy pauses Roman smiles
GUY

Is this a coincidence or are you
developing a man crush

ROMAN
Believe me my interest is purely
platonic

GUY

Sure thanks Save me a fare

Guy gets in Sits across from Roman in the long sedan

INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
The vehicle is on the move

ROMAN
Can I offer you a libation

GUY
I’1l have what you’re having

Roman serves him a scotch neat from a crystal decanter

ROMAN
I hope you like single malt This
is from a private distillery Aged
twenty-five years

Guy swirls the scotch in the glass releasing the aroma
before savoring it

GUY
A good whiskey lingers in your
mouth like a fond memory

ROMAN
Spoken like a true writer That is
your ambition am I right You
don’t look like an academic to me

GUY
Well I write but my ambition is
to be read

ROMAN
By as large of an audience as
possible
Guy nods
GUY

First I have to finish writing the
novel Then get it published
Finally go on the international
book tour

ROMAN
You’re thinking too small

GUY
Oh were playing that game Okay
Thirty weeks on the best seller’s
list Auction the movie rights to
the studios Clooney begs me to be
involved I turn him down to write
the sequels Fame and fortune
follows

Now you’re talking

Roman extends his glass Guy CLINKS his against it They
drink

No Name sits on the bed watching Rosemary as she looks with

some paranoia around the bedroom She’s racking her brain to
see if something is amiss

ROSEMARY
(to herself as much as No
Name)
What was he doing in here

She turns to the cat

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
Was he looking for something
(a revelation)
Or leaving something behind

Rosemary checks a bookcase starts to take books and knick
knacks off the shelf

INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The bottle is half empty Guy and Roman are well on their way
to a hangover morning They’re not slurring their words but
inhibitions have loosened

GUY

ROMAN
Me Started out in shipping Got
lucky with some properties then
moved into finance

GUY
Titan of industry

ROMAN
No that’s bullshit

He laughs Guy also finds it hysterical
ROMAN (CONTD)
This is my secret Do you want to

know my secret

GUY
Yes

ROMAN
I have never told anyone

GUY
Wait I want to write it down

Guy fumbles in his bag trying to find a pen

ROMAN
No you don’t have to It’s simple

Guy is all ears

ROMAN (CONTD)
I believe there are two people in
each person’s life that are
critical to his success If you
understand this and find the two
people you must answer to drop
everything to follow you will be a
success My first person was
Margaux my wife She made me
complete one whole person

GUY
My first person is Rosemary

Roman nods agrees

ROMAN
The other was my benefactor

GUY
Who was he

ROMAN
Doesn’t matter Your benefactor
will be a different person than
mine When you find him youll
know

Beat a little drunk

GUY
I want to write about you I want
you in my book

ROMAN
Then let’s do something for you to
write about

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Everything from the shelves have been pulled down and piled
on the bed or the floor Clothes from the closet Books

look in her eyes As if caught in a fever

ROSEMARY
(to the cat)
Where’s that camera No Name Did
he put a bug in here

Rosemary looks around her

ROSEMARY’S POV

A corner of the carpet sticks up from the ground

ROSEMARY

Moves to it She grabs the loose corner with both hands and
pulls up dislodging the carpet

INT CLUB MYSTERE - NIGHT

With a healthy mix of elegance and sex the club caters to a
very well heeled clientele men and women looking for some
spice in their lives Though the ratio stacks higher for
“HOSTESSES” versus “HOSTS” there are plenty of variety for

any preference

Roman leads Guy through the club where PATRONS mingle with
gorgeous people

ROMAN
Do you have a preference Or would
you care to experiment

Guy looks over to a sharply dressed Host who smiles at him

GUY
I’m open minded but not that open
minded

ROMAN

Then let me introduce you to
Ginger She’s very special

Roman makes a tiny gesture and a beautiful woman appears next
to Guy GINGER is a combustible mixture of demure and sex
Beauty without the intimidation

GINGER
Monsieur Castevet qui est votre
ami

ROMAN

This is Guy

GINGER
(in perfect English)
It’s my pleasure to know you

Guy looks at her Extremely attracted The temptation is
almost overwhelming He smiles takes a deep breath

GUY
I’m sure the pleasure will be mine
And I’1l probably regret this but
I can’t

Guy turns to Roman

GUY (CONTD)
Sorry I’m a straight shooter
Rosemary is waiting for me at home

Roman nods

ROMAN
You do not disappoint

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Guy enters the apartment coming down from the alcohol
feeling drained as if he’s been put to the test He drops his
bag on the floor and tosses his jacket onto a chair

He sighs EXITS FRAME

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Guy walks into the aftermath of a tornado Everything that
was on the shelves are piled high Drawers are emptied
clothes are strewn The carpet has been pulled up around the
edges of the room

Rosemary sits against a heavy but now empty armoire
exhausted She looks at her husband his presence seems to
bring her to her senses

GUY
Rosemary You okay

ROSEMARY
I’m so glad you’re here
(re armoire)
You can help me move this

GUY
Honey I think you’ve done enough
What’s going on Are you looking
for something

ROSEMARY
When I was pulling up the carpet I
noticed a slight difference in the
level of this moulding behind the
armoire

GUY
Baby

ROSEMARY
Help me move it Please I know
this looks crazy and maybe I am
crazy but I just have this
feeling

She looks at her husband Without another word he grabs the
other end of the armoire It’s heavy He strains with all his
might and together they manage to slide it away from the
wall

There is a break in the moulding and the armoire was hiding
a seam Rosemary pushes on the wall and with a CLICK a
utility door opens A small disused closet sits behind Some
old linen an even older vacuum cleaner

GUY
It’s a closet they weren’t using

ROSEMARY
Why hide it

Rosemary suddenly turns to Guy her eyes narrow in suspicion

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
What were you talking to Roman

about
GUY

When
ROSEMARY

At the school I was visiting
Jules I saw you with him

GUY
I’m a little embarrassed to admit
this Ro but I’m using him He’s
going to be a character in my book
(MORE)

GUY (CONTD)
Rosemary you’re acting a little
paranoid

She steps inside the closet pushing on the shelves the
walls Solid Maybe he’s right

ROSEMARY
You’re right I don’t know what

She pauses notices something on the ground sticking out
from beneath a shelf as if accidentally dropped She
carefully slides out a small square piece of paper Picks it
up It’s a photograph

CLOSE - PHOTOGRAPH

A couple with their arms around each other It’s Nena the
girl who jumped from the opening and her husband Jacques
(She is not wearing the amulet) The picture is taken in the

ROSEMARY
They were standing here This exact
spot when they took the picture

Guy comes out of the closet wearing a new suit crisp new
shirt

GUY
Rosemary you’re obsessed

ROSEMARY
What are you wearing

Guy becomes a little self conscious

GUY
I know what I said But I have an
interview for this new position at
the university I thought Id try
to make a good impression

ROSEMARY
Are you really interested Teaching
Romanticism

GUY
It’s almost doubled my salary

ROSEMARY
I thought you wanted to finish your
novel

GUY
Well that’s the thing It’s hard
to write when you’re devoid of
ideas

He looks into the mirror finishes tieing his tie

GUY (CONTD)
I’m not counting on getting this
Professor Ludwig Fuchs is
infinitely more qualified

ROSEMARY
No you’re going to be great
There’s nothing you can’t do when
you put your mind to it

GUY
Thanks mom

He gives her a kiss Guy is about to step out when he stops
turning back to Rosemary

GUY (CONT’D)
Ro I wouldn’t mention the picture
to anybody

ROSEMARY

You went a little nuts last night

Guy gives her a smile finally exits On Rosemary

EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY

Margaux moves through the floral area of an outdoor market
with Rosemary tagging along Every kind of plants and flowers
are for sale The scene is filled with color and vibrancy

MARGAUX
I’m so glad you decided to come
along Roman wouldn’t be caught
dead at the flower market

ROSEMARY
I adore them To me flowers
represent love

MARGAUX
Of course many do The most famous
being the rose But flowers have
Many meanings

She points out a couple

MARGAUX (CONTD)
Amaryllis represents pride Poppies
are symbols of magic fertility
eternal life Baby’s breath means
purity of heart and innocence

Margaux begins to gather flowers into a basket for a large

bouquet Rosemary appears to be waiting for the right moment
She hands Margaux some flowers

ROSEMARY
I was wondering Who lived in our
apartment before us

Margaux gives the slightest of pauses

MARGAUX
Why do you want to know

ROSEMARY
It’s such a great place Just can’t

imagine anybody wanting to move
out

Margaux remains silent

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
What were they like do you
remember

MARGAUX
(shakes her head)
They didn’t make much of an
impression

ROSEMARY
Do you know why they left

Margaux picks up a bunch of yellow flowers hands them to
Rosemary

MARGAUX
I want to get these for you

JULES
I did But this is better

Guy looks at her dubious

JULES (CONTD)
More confident More manly

GUY
(playing along)
Meaning I was what effeminate
before Not sure how I should take
that

She laughs

JULES
Ludwig is in there already
Probably boring the Dean with a
recitation of his academic
achievements

GUY
Not to mention his published works

JULES
But you’ve got the smile

GUY
Thanks for the pep talk

JULES
Hey seriously Good luck Youd be
perfect for the job

She reaches up to give him a good luck kiss Their lips meet
and the kiss lingers Guy pulls back Jules is breathless
confused

outside Mr Wees is entering the garden area He also stops
as if waiting for something In his hand the same book

From ANOTHER ANGLE Victoria Plasir ENTERS FRAME By now it
should become clear these are guests we’ve seen at Margaux
and Roman’s party Victoria spreads a blanket on the ground

places the same book on her chest a hand touching it

CLOSE - BOOK
A compendium of criticism by Professor Fuchs
ANOTHER ANGLE

Yoshiro Kawashiri rides up on a bicycle He parks the bike
takes the book out of his backpack

The four guests are at different areas of the courtyard far
away from one another No one looking at these four people
should make a connection that they are together in any way

Without a word or a glance to one another the four begin to
subtly and silently move their mouths as if repeating a
mantra Their fingers make tiny circles on the books

INT DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY

Ludwig Fuchs sits before the dean of the department DR

discomfort

handkerchief and dabs at his forehead wiping the back of his
neck

checks his phone searching for a distraction He smiles at
the SECRETARY who glances back at him with no expression

INT DEAN’S OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA PUSHES IN on Professor Fuchs He’s trying to hold it
together but he’s having difficulty concentrating The SOUND
of a fly BUZZES his ear He shivers Dr Carraro doesn’t
notice anything amiss He continues to talk

DR CARRARO

As Dr Carraro speaks one fly becomes two then four then
eight The BUZZING grows LOUDER commensurately Fuchs is
staring at Dr Carraro he can see his mouth move but the
BUZZING has drowned out his voice

EXT ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - SORBONNE - CONTINUOUS
Remaining far apart from one another the four guests of the

party subtly and rhythmically repeat a phrase - one we do not
hear Their fingers continue moving on the book

INT DEAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

As the Dean smiles from behind his desk finishing his
congratulations to Professor Fuchs

CLOSE - PROFESSOR FUCHS

CHAOTIC BUZZING reaching a crescendo a drop of blood drips
from his nose Fuchs dabs at the blood sees it on his
handkerchief The sight of red seems to propel him

Fuchs suddenly stands He picks up a pair of scissors from
the Dean’s desk moves around to Carraro and stabs him in the
chest CARRARO SCREAMS Blood seeps from his wound Panicked
Carraro manages to kick Fuchs away

Confused Fuchs looks at the scissors in his hands before

suddenly turning them on himself He stabs at his neck
severing the carotid artery and falls to the floor

GUY
The police Appelez la Police

The Secretary moves into action Guy lays Carraro down puts
pressure on his wound He looks into the office

off by law enforcement Police vehicles with flashing lights
ambulances and a coroner’s van are parked against the
building ONLOOKERS are held away from the perimeter beyond
that

CAMERA FINDS Guy sitting alone on the side steps He is
trying to make sense of what just happened Jules comes up to
him she is shaken her eyes are puffy from crying

JULES
Dr Carraro is going to be okay I
guess the scissors didn’t reach any
vital organs

GUY
That’s good news

JULES
Do you have any idea what happened

Guy shakes his head

JULES (CONTD)
I never thought Professor Fuchs was
capable of anything like that I
mean he wasn’t so much fun at
parties but I didn’t expect him to
have a psychotic break

GUY
I guess you never know what’s
hiding in a person’s heart

Jules nods

JULES
I probably shouldn’t be bringing
this up right now but this is good
for you

GUY
Don’t Jules

JULES
I mean it It’s sick but now
youre the best candidate for the
job

GUY
I’m not going to think about that
I don’t want to prosper from
somebody else’s misfortune

JULES
Can you stop being a pussy for a
second You had nothing to do with
his misfortune He was bipolar or
on drugs or whatever
Guy looks away from Jules

On the sidewalk beyond the crowd a silhouetted man He walks
with a cane looks very much like Roman

Guy sits up The hairs stand on the back of his neck

GUY
Will you excuse me

Guy moves quickly away from Jules He works his way past the

I don’t understand Do you know
them Are they missing

CAMERA PANS to find Rosemary across from him She looks a
little sheepish her obsession revealing itself

ROSEMARY
No I don’t know anything

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
But you have suspicions they were
met with foul play

ROSEMARY
(beat)
Yes

Commissioner Fountain waits for more

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
They lived in our apartment See
That’s our bedroom It’s morning
She just got out of bed She seems
happy here But there’s something
about her eyes When I look at the
picture I get a bad feeling

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
You have an entire life imagined
for them from this single snapshot

ROSEMARY
I know it’s crazy
(beat)
I’m wasting your time I’m sorry

Commissioner Fountain raises a hand somewhat charmed by her
intuition

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
Did you talk to Madame Castevet
She might know the whereabouts of
this mysterious couple

ROSEMARY
I tried She wouldn’t talk to me
about it

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
Do you feel she was hiding
something

Rosemary pauses she doesn’t want to speak ill of her friend
but she has doubts Fountain reads this loud and clear

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)
You don’t wish to disparage anyone
without evidence You’re a kind and
loyal friend I on the other hand
am only loyal to the law

He turns to his computer quickly taps the buttons on his
keyboard

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)
They lived in your apartment Let’s
check if there might be any police
activity reported at your address
last year

He hits enter Reads the information with interest on his
screen Rosemary sits up anxiously Fountain finally turns to
her

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)

suicide but investigators found
possible signs of violence on the
bedroom door It appears he missed
an appointment for questioning He
is presently missing

ROSEMARY
When did this happen

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
Three months ago

Rosemary reacts to the time period That’s when her own
personal tragedy occurred

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)
I will ask our detectives to double
their efforts to find Jacques
Pascal Thank you for bringing this
to my attention

He hands the picture back to Rosemary who looks at the image
with a grim satisfaction

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)
Rosemary You should always listen
to your feelings They’re bullet
proof

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rosemary ENTERS the front door The house is dark and after
the recent information a little foreboding A single lamp is
illuminated on a small table On it a glass of wine and a
note

Intrigued Rosemary moves to the table The note reads “Take
off your clothes Go to the bedroom” Rosemary smiles takes
a sip of wine EXITS FRAME

Rosemary walks naked into the darkened bedroom

No one is in the room Laid out on the bed delicate
lingerie and a beautiful sexy dress Another note
accompanies the clothes “Come up to the roof”

EXT PENTHOUSE ROOF - NIGHT

Strings of light are stretched across the roof top like stars
in the sky A round table is placed in the middle of the
expanse A large bouquet of flowers sits over starched linen
The place settings are exquisite

This is more of an intimate gathering than a party Guests
include Laura Veaulieu Mr Wees Victoria Plasir Yoshiro
Kawashiri and Jules who is enjoying a glass of wine with
Guy

The door opens to the rooftop Rosemary steps out in the
dress She is stunningly beautiful Rosemary is met by

Rosemary looks around sees Jules and Guy who move to her
Jules greets her with a hug and a kiss

ROSEMARY
Jules What a surprise

She turns to Guy

ROSEMARY (CONT’D)
What’s going on

JULES
Your husband is the new chair of
the Department of Romanticism at
the Sorbonne

GUY
I made the mistake of letting Roman
know and the rest is history This
is their idea

ROMAN
Life should be celebrated
Particularly when good things
happen to good people

Rosemary gives Guy a kiss

ROSEMARY
Congratulations I hope this is
everything you wanted

GUY
Not exactly Come here

He leads Rosemary away from the others They move to the edge
of the roof top Paris is before them It’s as romantic a
backdrop as can be

Rosemary looks at him
GUY (CONTD)
I think it’s time It’s going to be

She moves into his arms holding him tight

ROSEMARY
I believe you

They kiss to affirm their shared desire
MARGAUX

Did she say yes Does she want a
baby

Rosemary looks to Margaux then turns to Guy

GUY

Rosemarys broad smile gives Margaux her answer Everyone
APPLAUDS politely Margaux moves to them

ROSEMARY
How did you know
MARGAUX
What else can it be You have

everything
Margaux brings out a small black box

ROSEMARY
No more gifts

MARGAUX
No this is not a frivolous thing
like a dress This is serious

She opens the box to REVEAL a necklace with the gold amulet -
the same one Nena wore before her death Margaux takes it out
and hangs the amulet around Rosemary’s neck

ROSEMARY
What is it

MARGAUX
A family heirloom filled with
Tannis root from my greenhouse

Rosemary breathes in the perfume of the amulet Her head
swims with lightness

ROSEMARY
It’s pungent

MARGAUX

It’s actually quite powerful It’s

there to protect you and the baby

youll wear it
Rosemary touches the charm somehow it comforts her The
gold amulet sits twinkling around her neck
INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
Guy is SNORING SOFTLY in bed Rosemary beside him Another
restless night CAMERA DROPS TO A CLOSE UP as her eyes open
She stares out without focus
Rosemary climbs out of bed As if in a trance she walks to
the balcony Climbs up onto the ledge Traffic flows
frighteningly below her

She appears to snap out of it Finding herself in danger
again In the corner of her eyes something is behind her

It’s Guy He moves towards Rosemary

Rosemary reaches out to him for help He steps forward and
pushes her from the ledge

Rosemary tumbles from the balcony falling into space

As the ground RUSHES towards her

BED

Rosemary wakes with a START her heart POUNDING She reaches
for the base of her neck finds the amulet Touching it seems

to calm her down

She turns over to Guy next to her in bed He’s not there

INT WOODHOUSE RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Rosemary moves down the hallway A CLICKING SOUND drawing her
forward

illuminating his face His fingers are flying over the
keyboard Rosemary steps INTO FRAME

ROSEMARY
Guy what are you doing

GUY

ROSEMARY
It’s three in the morning

rush of thoughts to the screen On Rosemary watching her
husband manically typing she’s growing ever more
apprehensive

across the table from her

JULES
So you’re not just falling he’s
pushing you off the building

Rosemary nods Takes a sip of her tea

JULES (CONTD)
I’m going to get you a glass of
wine

ROSEMARY
I’m not drinking remember I’m
trying to detox before I ovulate
Which according to my calender is
next Tuesday

JULES
Yeah maybe you need to rethink
this whole getting pregnant thing

ROSEMARY
What are you talking about

JULES

Your dream It’s so obvious
Falling in a dream means you’re
anxious about something you’re
afraid of losing control Guy
pushing you means exactly that
What did he push you into recently
By the way very publicly

ROSEMARY
But I’m ready to try again

JULES
Your subconscious says you’re not

ROSEMARY
No It’s not that

Rosemary takes out the picture of Nena and Jacques from her
purse She hands it to Jules who looks at it puzzled

JULES
I don’t get it Is Guy pressuring
you into wife swapping

ROSEMARY
No This is Nena and Jacques they
lived in our apartment three months
ago She either jumped off or
maybe was pushed off the balcony in
our bedroom

JULES
Creepy

ROSEMARY
They’re still trying to find him
Maybe my dream is a premonition

JULES
You think Guy is going to kill you
Boy you really do need a drink

ROSEMARY
No I don’t think that Of course
not I just know that whatever my
dream meant she had the answer
But now I’1l1 never know because
she’s dead

Jules studies the photograph

JULES
Maybe you can go talk to her
friends

ROSEMARY

I don’t know anything about her
How would I find her friends

Jules points to a small tattoo on the inside of Nena’s wrist

JULES
See that That’s a symbol for
Coptic Christians If she’s devout
enough to tattoo it on her wrist
she probably went to church
There’s only one Coptic church in
Paris

Rosemary smiles awkwardly but she’s prepared She hands the
photo of Nena to the Father and presses play on her phone
translating her question

PHONE

The Father’s face darkens He looks around nervously

ROSEMARY
Do you know her

She starts to type her question into her phone The Father
gestures for Rosemary to follow

INT COPTIC CHURCH - HALLWAY - DAY

Father Alim leads Rosemary through a maze of narrow hallways
It feels as if she’s making a dark and mysterious descent
Rosemary looks nervously behind her trying to avoid becoming
lost Father Alim finally stops He KNOCKS softly on a wooden
door

FATHER ALIM
Il ya quelquun ici Elle a demandé
a propos de Nena

After a beat the door opens An old man looks at Rosemary
with suspicious eyes His white hair wild and unkept This is
Father Tekem His eyes drop to the gold amulet around her
neck

FATHER TEKEM
Nena had a necklace just like that

Rosemary touches the amulet He steps aside and allows her
into a small room Father Alim closes the door leaving them
alone

find the reason why

FATHER TEKEM
I know why Nena was consorting
with Satanists She lived in an
unholy place La Chime’re

Rosemary is taken aback

ROSEMARY
That’s where I live

Father Tekem pauses as if deciding to trust the girl before
him

FATHER TEKEM

its past

2001 He was a Satanist Maybe
Satan himself

Father Tekem rummages through some tattered belongings He
pulls out a faded picture of Steven Marcato Looks like a
picture from a magazine It is the image of the handsome blue
eyed man Rosemary saw earlier in the me’nage a’ trois

he’s so successful The devil hides
behind his billions

Margaux wields a cleaver like Delphine in the flashback of
the Trench sisters she swings it viciously down onto a
butcher block where a black skin chicken (these really exist)
is being cut into pieces She dumps the chicken into a clay
pot with pungent herbs and other unique plants

The steam from the pot wafts over Rosemary who wrinkles her
nose from the smell She watches the proceedings with some
trepidation

MARGAUX
I see you’re not wearing the
amulet

Rosemary touches her bare neck a little defensively

ROSEMARY
I didn’t feel like it today And
what exactly are you making for me

MARGAUX
Fertility soup You drink it after
it simmers for twelve hours in the
clay pot

ROSEMARY
Does it taste good

MARGAUX
No Terrible But it will make you
ready to have a baby I learned
this from the Chinese

As Margaux stirs more herbs into the concoction

MARGAUX (CONTD)
My dear friend Shui Fa had to flee
China after the communist
revolution She had three nights to
conceive a child with a man she was
forced to leave behind This is the
recipe she used to make her
fertile A recipe she still uses
today

Not for herself obviously Your
friend must be in her late
eighties

Beat Margaux seems to catch herself

Of course For occasions like this
one My friends and their secrets
are at your disposal

ROSEMARY
What about your secrets

Margaux turns to Rosemary

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
Why didn’t you tell me about Nena

Margaux pauses It is emotional for her

MARGAUX
How do you talk about the most
painful heartbreak of your life I
loved Nena like the daughter I
never had I begged her to leave
her husband He was a dark force
who had a strangle hold on her
soul I tried so many ways to help
her out of the trap I knew she was
in At one time Roman had a plane
waiting to take her anywhere she
wanted to go

Margaux’s eyes well with tears

MARGAUX (CONTD)
I saw her on the day before she
died I still remember her smile
She told me she was so happy she
was walking on air She had just
found out she was pregnant

A tear rolls down Margaux’s cheek Rosemary moves to her
feeling her pain Nena’s story reflecting on her own tragedy

MARGAUX (CONTD)
I’m so sorry I didn’t tell you
before The pain of losing her
almost destroyed me I was afraid
to face it again I have no more
secrets

ROSEMARY
I was a cynic I thought you and
Roman were too good to be true

ROSEMARY (CONTD)
And when I found out about Nena I
thought somehow I was being used
I’m sorry I doubted you

about replacing Nena I care about
you I only want you to be happy
and healthy

breath next to his ear at night

Roman is strong It’1ll take more
than a bullet to kill him

Margaux smiles through her tears

MARGAUX
He always said to me Il ne faut
jamais jeter le manche aprés la
cognée One should never throw the
handle after the felling axe
(beat)
It loses something in translation

GUY
I think we say in English “Never
say die”

Commissioner Fountain approaches Guy and the ladies Margaux
stands moves to him in gratitude

MARGAUX
Commissioner thank you for
shooting that bastard I can only
hope he suffered before his death

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
Jacques Pascal is not dead Madame
Castevet Barring complications
the doctors expect him to recover
They’re prepping him for surgery
now I will talk to him the moment
he regains consciousness There are
so many questions he can answer
MARGAUX
I would be curious myself to know
why he felt the need to shoot my
husband

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
Jacques and his wife lived in your
building In the same place where
Guy and Rosemary are living now Is
that correct

MARGAUX
Yes His wife died three months
ago
(beat)
The police told me it was suicide

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
With what happened tonight I think
we may have to consider another
theory

(turns to Rosemary)

Mrs Woodhouse could I ask you a
few questions while the incident is
fresh in your mind

Rosemary nods

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)
Can you tell me exactly what
Jacques said before he fired his
weapon

ROSEMARY
He said something in French Which
I didn’t understand

Fountain turns to Margaux and Guy who shake their heads

GUY
We were too far away

ROSEMARY
Then he said he wanted what was
his no what was promised And
then he said no more lies Then he
shot Roman

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
Could Roman have broken a promise
to Jacques Something that happened
while he lived there

Guy looks to Margaux interested in the answer himself

MARGAUX
Cest impossible Roman would never
break his promises You know my
husband yourself Commissioner
It’s an insult to me that you would
take the jabbers of an assassin
seriously

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN
Madame Castevet I am merely a
dispassionate servant of the truth
I think that is how you should be
satisfied with your Police
Commissioner

Margaux looks at him with fire in her eyes Fountain turns to
Guy and Rosemary

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)
Is there anything else you can
remember Maybe you might have seen
him before tonight

Rosemary shakes her head Guy remains quiet but he fidgets
with unease Commissioner Fountain clocks this

COMMISSIONER FOUNTAIN (CONT’D)

Please call if you think of
anything

(to Margaux)
I wish Roman a quick and complete
recovery But I will also need to
speak with him the moment he’s
able

The Commissioner moves away Margaux gives a tense smile to
Rosemary and Guy

MARGAUX
I want to start a prayer
ROSEMARY
That’s a great idea We’ll go to
the chapel
MARGAUX

No I must do this myself

ROSEMARY
Are you sure you want to be alone

MARGAUX
If you have faith you are never
alone

Rosemary gives her a hug

GUY
Well be here I’11 call if there’s
any news

Margaux nods somberly before walking down the hallway

on the floor that way Anti-Christ Margaux EXITS

pain from his abdomen where the Surgeon has sliced him
opened He jerks his body wildly

Nurses try to hold his body still but the pain is too great
WAILING Jacques writhes in agony twisting and turning
Nurses with clamps inside his opened abdomen try to hang on
but his movements rip the instruments from their hands A
scalpel inadvertently slips slices open an artery Blood
geysers from his abdomen SURGEONS and NURSES try to stem the
damage but they can’t keep Jacques still

FEMALE SURGEON
Sedate him Sedate lui

The Anesthesiologist plunges a needle full of drugs into his
arm Nothing seems to stop Jacques’ painful spasms

ANESTHESIOLOGIST
It’s not working
