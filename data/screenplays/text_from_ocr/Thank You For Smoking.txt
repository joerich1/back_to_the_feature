INT THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW SET —- DAY

Oprah Winfrey a woman who calls no one boss stands before
her audience Not just the hundred or so people that have
waited in line to sit in her presence Moreover the millions
of people who will devour each and every word that leaves her
lips as soon as the red light atop STUDIO CAMERA A turns on

Sounds daunting You and I couldn’t do it in a million years
This however is what she was born to do

The RED LIGHT bursts on and without flinching she says

OPRAH
A couple years ago RJR Nabisco the
company that makes Camel cigarettes was
forced by a Supreme Court Injunction to
discontinue the use of the character
known as Joe Camel due to its clear
connection with teen smoking However
many now feel that this is not enough
The question we continue to face is ‘What
will it take to get kids off cigarettes’

A LOGO with the last sentence appears on screen

We move across the PANELISTS as Oprah introduces them in
between bursts of applause

OPRAH

I want to introduce you to Sue Maclean
head of the National Organization of
Mothers Against Smoking

(applause)
Francis Gyverson is the executive
director of the National Teachers’s
Association in Washington

(applause)
Ron Goode is an aide to Senator
Finisterre of Vermont who is leading the
political battle on cigarettes

(to Ron)
Does that make you a colonel

RON
Just a foot soldier Oprah

More applause Oprah stops at a fifteen year old boy named
ROBIN whose bald head is obviously not a fashion statement
OPRAH
Robin Williger is a fifteen year old
freshman from Racine Wisconsin He likes
studying history and he’s on the debate
team Robin’s future looked bright
however recently he was diagnosed with
Cancer A very tough kind of Cancer
Robin tells me he has quit smoking though
and no longer thinks cigarettes are cool

Thunderous applause
Oprah stops in front of NICK NAYLOR our hero

OPRAH
Nick Naylor is the Vice President of the
Academy of Tobacco Studies They are the
tobacco industry’s main lobby in
Washington DC and Mr Naylor is their
chief spokesman

(to Nick)

Thank you for coming Nick

Silence

NICK (VO)
Few people on this planet know what it is
to be truly despised

The scene FREEZES as we switch to Nick’s POV of the CROWD
This is a very angry bunch of people As we pass the FROZEN
CROWD we see PEOPLE mid-scream mid-spit mid-gesture

NICK (VO)

Can you blame them I earn a living
fronting an organization that kills one
thousand two hundred human beings a day
Twelve Hundred People We’re talking two
jumbo jet planeloads a day of men women
and children I mean there’s Caesar
Alexander the Great and me

EXT ACADEMY OF TOBACCO STUDIES —- DAY

A collegiate style brick building with no distinct features
featuring a yellow sign THE ACADEMY OF TOBACCO STUDIES

NICK (VO)

This is where I work The Academy of
Tobacco Studies It was established by
seven gentlemen you may recognize from C-
Span

FLASH IMAGES The seven Tobacco CEO’s testifying in Congress

NICK (VO)

These guys realized quick if they were
going to claim that cigarettes were not
addictive they better have proof

INT LAB —- ACADEMY OF TOBACCO STUDIES —- DAY

ERHARDT VON GRUPPEN-MUNDT an older scientist who “escaped”
from Germany His lapel reads “scientist-in-residence” He
signals a lab tech who presses a button on a machine linked
to a glass cage of mice Immediately it fills with smoke

NICK (VO)

This is the man they rely on Erhardt Von
Gruppen-Mundt They found him in Germany
I won’t go into the details He’s been
testing the link between nicotine and
lung cancer for thirty years and hasn’t
found any conclusive results The man is
a genius He could disprove gravity

INT LAW LIBRARY - ACADEMY OF TOBACCO STUDIES —- DAY

Twenty KILLER LAWYERS sit around a conference table
devouring law books and journals

’

NICK (VO)

Then we’ve got our sharks We draft them
out of Ivy League law schools and give
them sports cars and time shares It’s
just like a John Grisham novel without
all the espionage
INT PUBLIC RELATIONS - ACADEMY OF TOBACCO STUDIES - DAY

A mix of red and yellow wood paneling makes the place
actually look like a cigarette carton

NICK (VO)
Most importantly we’ve got spin control
That’s where I come in I get paid to
talk I don’t have an MD or a law degree
I’ve got a bachelors in kicking ass and
taking names

INT PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

Nick’s head turns towards us in SLO-MO As his mouth opens to
speak we ramp into SUPER-SPEED sending his mouth to 100 WPS
(words per second) Nick expels syllables like bullets to the
sound of an M-16 emptying a full clip

NICK (VO)
You know that guy who can pick up any
girl

EXT BASEBALL DIAMOND —- DAY
Nick is at the plate in rolled up sleeves and a tie He
clicks the bat against his loafers There’s the pitch He

swings connects home run

NICK (VO)
I’m him on crack

BACK TO
INT OPRAH WINFREY SHOW SOUND STAGE - DAY

OPRAH
Whod like to start

Nick raises his hand bringing uncertainty to his fellow
panelists and Oprah alike

NICK
Is it all right if I smoke

Gasps all around

OPRAH
You want to smoke
NICK
Well it’s traditional at firing squads
to offer the condemned a last cigarette

Silence then a laugh then a few more laughs even
Oprah begins to chuckle Pretty soon the whole audience is
laughing

SUE
I’m sorry but I don’t think that’s
funny

RON

I have to agree I don’t see the humor in
it And I suspect Robin Williger doesn’t
either

Whip to Robin for reaction but Cancer Kid is laughing
Nick is beside himself He smiles as if he just became a
father

Nick looks back to Mr Ron Goode with renewed confidence
Nick attacks

NICK

(to Ron)
Oh why don’t you leave him alone and
stop trying to tell him how he ought to
feel

(to Oprah)
This is typical of the attitude of the
federal government It’s this same
attitude that brought us Prohibition
Vietnam and fifty years of living on the
brink of nuclear destruction

(pointing to Ron)
But for a member of the government to
come on this show and lecture about
cancer when the same government for the
last sixty years has been producing
atomic bombs twenty-five thousand of
them capable of giving every man woman
and child on this planet cancer so awful
so ghastly so untreatable that medical
science doesn’t even have a name for them
yet is just beneath contempt

RON
Beneath contempt This from the man whose
paycheck is signed by big tobacco

(MORE )
RON (CONTD)

This from the man who will profit off
Robin Williger’s death

NICK
Oprah how on earth would “Big Tobacco”
profit off of the loss of this young man
I hate to think in such callous terms
but if anything we’d be losing a
customer It’s not only our hope but it’s
in our best interests to keep Robin alive
and smoking

RON
That’s ludicrous

NICK
Let me tell you something Oprah and let
me share something with the fine
concerned people in the audience today
The Ron Goode’s of this world want the
Robin Willigers to die

RON
What

NICK

(Holds Robin’s shoulder)
Awful but true I’m sorry but it’s a
fact And do you know why I’1l tell you
why So that their budgets will go up
This is nothing less than trafficking in
human misery and you sir ought to be
ashamed of yourself

(back to audience)
Of course the Academy does not condone
underage smoking or drinking and driving
for that matter for the simple reason
that they are against the law

(time for the ammo)
As a matter of fact we’re about to
launch a fifty-million-dollar campaign
aimed at persuading kids not to smoke

OPRAH
And with that we’ll take a short break
Hang on their’s much more to come

CARDBOARD BOX A TEACHER opens a door and sticks her head out

TEACHER
Mr Naylor it’s time

Nick stands and fixes his tie

TEACHER (CONT’D)
Joey is such a bright young man We all
look forward to him coming out of his
shell a little He’s a bit shy

NICK
He gets that from his mother

The teacher lets out a little “oh”

INT CLASSROOM —- DAY

A BANNER hung across the chalkboard reads “WHAT DO YOU DO”
Nick enters the classroom and smiles to his son JOEY who tries to smile back but comes across well terrified
Nick sets his cardboard box down on the teacher’s desk and
slices it open with a pair of black handled school scissors
He then proceeds down the aisle with his box handing each

student a JOE CAMEL PLUSH TOY

NICK
Here you go One each Enjoy

The teacher’s jaw drops Nick gets to his son’s desk
JOEY
(whispering)
Please don’t ruin my childhood
Nick nods reassuringly then proceeds to the next desk
After finishing the class Nick returns to the front and
drops the box He takes in a breath trying to swallow all

the oxygen in the room Then he begins

NICK
How many of you want to be lawyers when
you grow up
One hand A real prick of a kid

NICK
How about movie stars

Almost every hand in the room goes up
NICK
How about lobbyists

KID 1
What’s that

NICK
It’s kind of like being in the movies
It’s what I do I talk for a living

KID 2
What do you talk about

NICK
I speak on behalf of cigarettes

Gasps around the room Joey looks around in growing fear
KID 3

My mom used to smoke She says that
cigarettes kill

NICK
(to Kid 3)
Really Is your mom a doctor
KID 3
No
NICK
(to Kid 3)
A scientific researcher of some kind
KID 3
No
NICK

Well she doesn’t exactly sound like a
credible expert now does she

Kid 3 sinks in his seat

NICK
Don’t feel bad It’s okay to listen to
your mom
(winking at Joey)
I mean it’s good to listen to your
parents
(to the class)
(MORE )

NICK (CONTD)

All I’m suggesting is that there will
always be people trying to tell you what to
do and what to think There probably
already are people doing that Am I right

Nods across the classroom The teacher is a little skittish

NICK (CONTD)
I’m here to say that when someone tries
to act like some sort of expert you can
respond “who says”

KID 4
So cigarettes are good for you

TEACHER
(quickly)
No

NICK
- No that’s not what I’m getting at My
point is you have to think for yourself
(bangs a desk)
Challenge authority

A couple kids gasp

NICK (CONTD)
If your parents told you that chocolate
was dangerous would you just take their
words for it

THE WHOLE CLASS
Noooo

NICK
Exactly So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep when it comes to cigarettes
you should find out for yourself

TEACHER
(steps in front of Nick)
Okay then Thank you Mr Naylor for

joining us

Joey and his dad meet eyes Nick gives a little “Howd I
do” motion Joey looks back and sighs

EXT PARKING LOT JOEY’S SCHOOL —- DAY

CUT TO
INT DINING ROOM —- NICK’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Nick and Joey sit at opposite ends of the DINING ROOM TABLE
doing their respective homework

Nick is HIGHLIGHTING lines from various briefs

Joey is trying to write an essay Pencil on paper Joey stops
for a moment He looks up at his father

JOEY
Dad why is American government the best
government

NICK
(without looking)
Because of our endless appeals system

Joey goes back to writing Nick suddenly looks up and
realizes what he’s done

NICK
Joey you’re not writing what I just
said are you

Joey nods YES
NICK
Stop for a second

Joey drops his pencil

NICK
What is the subject of your essay

JOEY
Why is the American government the best
government in the world

NICK
Your teacher crafted that question

JOEY
Yeah Why

NICK
Well for the moment I’11 look past the
obvious problems in syntax and focus more
on the core of the question

Joey rolls his eyes He’s heard this before

NICK (CONTD)
I mean A Does America have the best
government and B What constitutes a
best government Crime Poverty
Literacy in America Definitely not
best Perhaps not even better than most

(however )

We do have a very entertaining

government
JOEY
Dad
NICK
Sorry

(back to being a father)
Joey are you familiar with the term BS

JOEY
(matter of fact)
Bullshit

NICK
Yes Exactly BS if I may is what
questions like the one your teacher posed
are made for

(MORE)

NICK (CONTD)

Even if America had the best government
thered be no way to prove it in how
many pages are you writing

JOEY
Two pages

NICK
Definitely not in two pages

JOEY
So what am I supposed to write

NICK
Whatever you want

JOEY
(elaborate)
Okay
NICK

Write about America’s amazing ability to
make profit by breaking down trading
tariffs and bringing American jobs to
third world countries or how good we are
at executing felons They’re all correct
answers

JOEY
I can do that

NICK
Oh Joey that’s the beauty of argument
If you argue correctly you’re never
wrong

A whole new world opens in Joey’s eyes
Nick goes back to his work
JOEY
Dad if I finish the essay within an
hour can we stay up all night
NICK
(without looking up)
That’s a negotiation not an argument

INT NICK’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Nick intently watches THE SANDS OF IWO JIMA Joey has already
fallen asleep next to him

On TV - John Wayne having brought his men through hell to
victory gives them the post game speech

JOHN WAYNE
»-I never felt so good in my life How
about a cigarette

Just as he’s offering the pack around to his men a Japanese
sniper drills him dead

Without realizing it Nick takes out a cigarette PACK He
reaches for a smoke but the pack is empty Nick looks back
at John Wayne then back at his Cigarette Pack Nick smiles
He’s got something

EXT BEAUTIFUL SUBURBAN COTTAGE - MONDAY MORNING
Nick pulls up to the curb in front of the house

NICK (VO)
This was the first house I ever bought

Nick and Joey walk up to the door It opens revealing Nick’s
ex-wife JILL Joey scurries past his mother into the house

JILL
You still own a watch don’t you Nick

Nick waits for the end of this insult

JILL
Eight O’Clock is when the little hand is
pointing directly at eight

NICK
Jill I can’t help feeling that Joey is
getting the wrong idea about his father
It would be great if I could spend a
little more time with him You know to
give him a fair and balanced perspective

JILL
Nick you had plenty of time to be his
father Now you’re his weekend guardian

NICK
He still needs a father

On cue BRAD steps through the door between them Brad is
Nick’s taller and broader replacement He’s an MD and he’s
wearing the WHITE COAT and BADGE to prove it

BRAD
Nick you got a second

NICK
Sure Brad

Brad walks Nick back to his car

BRAD
Nick your job and everything aside I
hope you understand that second hand
smoke is a real killer

NICK
What are you talking about

BRAD
I just hope you keep Joey in a smoke free
environment That’s all I’m saying

NICK
Brad I’m his father You’re the guy
fucking his mom

Nick gets into his car

BRAD
That’s just unnecessary

On TV Finistirre pulls back a curtain revealing a SKULL AND

FINISTIRRE
It is my hope that by the end of the
year all cigarette packages sold in the
United States will carry this emblem
Perhaps then cigarettes will finally be
labeled appropriately - as poison I will
be holding a congressional hearing to
discuss the inclusion of the skull and
crossbones in two weeks time As usual I
send an open invitation to Big Tobacco to
come and join us Perhaps this time they
will grace us with their presence and

And Bogie throws the matches at her

Nick tosses a book of matches to an attractive young lobbyist

NICK

-And she catches them Greatest romance

These days when someone smokes in a
movie they’re either a psychopath or

Nick goes in for the kill

NICK
The message Hollywood needs to send out
is Smoking is Cool We need the cast of
Will and Grace smoking in their living
room Forrest Gump puffing away between
his box of chocolates Hugh Grant earning
back the love of Julia Roberts by buying
her favorite brand her Virginia Slims
Most of the actors smoke already If they
start doing it on screen we can put the
sex back into cigarettes

Nick feels like taking a bow but he’ll settle for a seat

BR
Well it’s a thought I was hoping for
something a little more inspiring but at
least you’re thinking People slam your
fucking brains against your desks until
something useful comes out

BR stands and the meeting is over
As people leave BR motions to Nick

The Captain takes a long sip

CAPTAIN
Do you enjoy your current work Nick

NICK
Yes it’s challenging If you can do
Tobacco you can do anything

CAPTAIN
You kind of struggled before this

NICK
Yes briefly

CAPTAIN
It’s one of the reasons we hired you

Nick looks up in disbelief (really”)
CAPTAIN
Nothing pushes a man harder than the need
to rewrite his own obituary
Nick ponders this as he sips his Mint Julip
CAPTAIN
You know Nick you remind me just a

little bit of myself when I was your age

NICK
Thank you sir

CAPTAIN
Tell me what is your opinion of BR

NICK
BR is my boss

CAPTAIN
I like to think that I’m your boss son
But I do admire loyalty in a man I can
forgive almost anything in a man if he’s
loyal Like that Oprah show you did You
could have given up cried and
apologized but you stayed loyal And you
gave it to that son’v’a bitch good

NICK
Thank you sir

CAPTAIN
BR’s come under the idea that we should
start bribing Producers in Hollywood to
make their actors smoke on screen

It takes every part of Nick’s strength to not verbally
dismantle BR right there and then

NICK
Say that’s a great idea

CAPTAIN
Smart man that BR

NICK
Oh yeah and loyal

Senator FINISTIRRE is interrogating a very sweaty Ron Goode

FINISTIRRE
Where the hell did you find cancer boy

RON
He was supposed to be very reliable The
Lung Association was one of his
references

FINISTIRRE

(to himself)
Fucking non-profits

(back to Ron)
When you’re looking for a cancer kid he
should be hopeless He should have a
wheelchair He should have trouble
speaking He should have a pet goldfish
that he carries around in a little
ziplock bag Hopeless He should not have
a sense of humor

RON
I apologize Senator But if it wasn’t for
Nick Naylor

FINISTIRRE

Nick Naylor Don’t even think of using
that as an excuse The man shills
bullshit for a living You work for a
fucking Senator A Senator who is
supposed to be tough on Tobacco Have a
little pride

Come here

I’m sorry

FINISTIRRE
Come here

Ron stands up and steps up to the desk Finistirre grabs
Ron’s TIE with one hand then with the other grabs a SHARPIE
off his desk and proceeds to write something on Ron’s

No I don’t imagine that’s a problem I
want to know how you see yourself

NICK
I’m a mediator between two sects of
society that are trying to reach an
accommodation

HEATHER
Interesting My other interviews have
pinned you as a mass murderer profiteer
pimp bloodsucker child killer and my
personal favorite Yuppie Mephistopheles

NICK
Sounds like a balanced article

HEATHER
Who else should I talk to

NICK
Fifty-five million American smokers for
starters or perhaps the American tobacco
farmer who is constantly being treated
like a drug smuggler

I actually plan on speaking to a tobacco
farmer

I’m sure he is proud of me

HEATHER
And if you caught him smoking

NICK
I would do everything in my power to stop
him

HEATHER
Really

NICK
He’s a minor It’s against the law

HEATHER
Is a mortgage really much of a life goal

NICK
Ninety-nine percent of everything that is
done in the world good or bad is done to
pay a mortgage Perhaps the world would
be a better place if everyone rented

Why don’t you rent

Oh I rent as well

that is tearing up fifty percent of
American families and depriving millions
of children of their right to grow up and
explore their world

Jill drops her fork

Lorne emerges from the shadows shotgun over his shoulder
He’s broad and weathered A cowboy with lung cancer

LORNE LUTCH
What do you want here

The Sebring’s passenger door flies open and Joey runs out

JOEY
Dad

NICK
Joey get back in the car

Joey freezes Nick raises his arms

NICK
I just want to talk

A fly buzzes around Nick Lorne stares him down then looks
over at Joey who is hyperventilating

LORNE LUTCH
All right Come in

Lorne turns back inside holding the door open with the
muzzle of his shotgun

Nick lowers his arms and walks up to the house Joey stays a
moment then follows

INT LIVING ROOM - LORNE LUTCH’S RANCH HOUSE- DAY

Hot and dusty Perhaps a Deer Head Photos of Lorne with
celebrities and politicians that cease circa 1970

Lorne returns the shotgun to its rack

LORNE LUTCH
Pearl we’ve got company

PEARL Lorne’s wife nurse and reason to be alive enters the
room from a hallway and freezes at the sight of Nick

PEARL
Mister you’ve got a lot’a’nerve

LORNE LUTCH
(gesturing to Joey)
Pearl Show this young man some Ice Tea

Joey’s mind is in hyperdrive trying to keep up with the
information Who is my father

Pearl pats Joey on the back and leads him into the kitchen
However Joey finds a seat where he can still view the action
in the living room

Nick takes a seat on the couch while Lorne eases into his
rocking chair

LORNE LUTCH

Saw you on weren’t you on that Oprah
show

NICK
Yeah

LORNE LUTCH
Youre lucky you made it out of there
alive

NICK
Tobacco used to be all over television
Now TV is leading the witch hunt

LORNE LUTCH
Strange business In the early fifties
they had the first cancer scare so they
brought in those filters Then they got
worried that men would think filters were
for pussies That’s where I came in

NICK
You were great I used to want to be you
I mean when I was growing up We all
did

LORNE LUTCH
Last year after I got diagnosed I flew
east to attend the annual stockholders’
meeting I stood up and told them that
they ought to limit their advertising
And do you know what your boss said to
me

Nick knows but doesn’t interrupt

LORNE LUTCH
He said ‘We’re certainly sorry to hear
about your medical problem

(MORE )

LORNE LUTCH(CONTD)

However without knowing your medical
history we can’t comment further’ Then
they tried to pretend I never worked for
them I mean I’ve got pay stubs but hell
I’m on the damn billboards

(breaks for breath)
I never even smoked Marlboro I smoked
Kools

The two men chuckle over this
INT KITCHEN - LORNE LUTCH’S RANCH HOUSE - SAME

Pearl gives Joey an Ice Tea

PEARL

JOEY

No I live with my mom

PEARL
Did he tell you why he’s here today

JOEY
He said your husband is the Marlboro
Man

PEARL

Not anymore
The PHONE rings Pearl gets up and turns on the TV Cartoons
PEARL

Pearl exits through the back of the kitchen

As soon as she’s gone Joey scoots up to the doorway
overlooking the living room

INT LIVING ROOM —- LORNE LUTCH’S RANCH HOUSE —- SAME
LORNE LUTCH
You look like a nice enough fellah What

are you doing working for these assholes

Hold on Nick as he chooses his words carefully
NICK
I’m good at it I’m better at doing this
than I ever was at doing anything else

LORNE LUTCH
Well hell son I was good at shooting
Koreans but I didn’t make it my career

There is a pause as Lorne studies Nick

LORNE LUTCH
I suppose we all got to pay the mortgage
somehow

Nick exhales

LORNE LUTCH
So you here to talk me into shutting up
Is that what’s in that case of yours

Joey stares trying to keep up with the action

NICK
Yeah basically
(picking up the briefcase)
No not basically That’s exactly it

LORNE LUTCH
My dignity ain’t for sale

NICK
This isn’t an offer It’s a gift The
taxes have all been paid You get to keep
it no matter what you do The idea is
that your guilt will prevent you from bad-
mouthing us

LORNE LUTCH
Were you supposed to tell me all that

NICK
No Just apologize give you the money
and leave

LORNE LUTCH
Then why are you telling me this

A moment Joey gets closer Then

Nick ignites He looks up at Lorne

NICK
Because this way you’ll take the money

LORNE LUTCH
Why would I do that

NICK
Because you’re mad The first thing
youll do is call the LA Times and CNN

LORNE LUTCH
Damn straight

NICK
And insist on Bonnie Dalton She does
really good controlled outrage Tell them
no Bonnie no story watch it on MSNBC

LORNE LUTCH
(trying to keep up)
Okay

NICK
When they get here open up the case and
dump all the cash out onto the floor

LORNE LUTCH
Why

Nick is really cooking now He gets up

NICK
It’1l look more effective Here look

Nick opens the briefcase and begins to dump the MONEY onto
the floor it’s a lot of money

Joey’s eyes widen

NICK
(shaking the case)
Don’t forget to shake every last bundle
out And if you can you know give a
cough or two

Nick dumps the briefcase
NICK

Once it’s all out you tell them what
you’re going to do with it

LORNE LUTCH
(now standing)
What am I going to do with it

NICK

Donate it Start the Lorne Lutch Cancer
Foundation You’1l have a ranch and a
fair anda 5K

(aside to Lorne)
The 5K is a must

(back to pitch)
The TV coverage will be great

LORNE LUTCH
Wait what about my family

NICK
Whoa Lorne you can’t keep the money

LORNE LUTCH
(caught in the enthusiasm)
Why the hell not

NICK
What denounce us and then keep the blood
money Look at it

Lorne looks at the pile of money One million dollars is a
lot of money

LORNE LUTCH
I’ve got to think it over

NICK
You can’t denounce us next week News
doesn’t work that way Lorne

LORNE LUTCH
I don’t suppose I can denounce you for
half of it

NICK
No Lorne You either keep all the money
or give it all away

Lorne looks to Nick for support Nick has now turned off
Lorne looks back down at the money

take the money

Nick shoots a look at Joey ready to question how he saw
Lorne and the briefcase but relents - He saw

NICK
Youd have to be crazy to turn down all
that money As soon as I saw he wasn’t
crazy I knew he’d take it

JOEY
Would you have taken it

NICK
If I were him
(thinks for a second)
Sure

Joey thinks for a second

with pride

LARRY
Now Nick you created quite a fuss on the
Oprah Show didn’t you

NICK
I’ll say this I don’t think I will be
getting my annual invitation to the
Finistirre Labor Day Barbecue

FINISTIRRE
(defensive)
Uh Larry as you probably know I don’t
believe in the annual barbecuing of
livestock which only adds to the animal
cruelty problem that permeates the
heartland

LARRY KING
Well Senator it doesn’t sound like
youll be having Nick over anytime soon
for anything

FINISTIRRE
I continue to offer an open invitation to
Mr Naylor to join us in Congress to
discuss the inclusion of our new poison
label which if I may say

LARRY KING
How ‘bout it Nick Will you be making an
appearance in Congress

NICK
Not as long as the Senator is calling for
me to be fired It’s not exactly a
welcome invitation

LARRY KING
It could be considered a mixed message
Senator

FINISTIRRE

Not as mixed as Big Tobacco’s stance on
the dangers of smoking cigarettes

Nick begins to laugh This takes both Larry and Finistirre off
guard

LARRY KING
Nick now you’re laughing The Senator
does have a point doesn’t he
NICK
I can’t help myself I’m tickled by the
idea of the gentleman from Vermont
calling me a hypocrite This from a man
who in one day held a press conference
where he called for the American tobacco
fields to be slashed and burned Then
jumped on a private jet Flew down to
Peru for the Eco Summit and denounced the
Meed corporation for deforestation I’m
sorry I find that funny

Joeys smile says My dad is one bad ass motherfucker

Would you like to respond Mr Senator

specified that we couldn’t make it our

Nick and BR nod Impressed by the logic

The DISPLAY shows a SKULL AND CROSSBONES contorted into the
happy face associated with “have a nice day” - It’s horrifying

AD MAN
It scored just slightly higher than our

Nick chooses every word carefully

NICK
Heather there is a lot of information in

HEATHER

You never said anything about off the

NICK
I presumed anything said while I was
inside you was considered privileged

HEATHER
Nick you are really cute If you wanted
to talk on a plane or at a movie or over
dinner that would have been fine But
you wanted to fuck That’s fine by me

Nick is stunned Even insulted by this realization

Nick half of my job is damage control
And today that consists of distancing
ourselves from you entirely and letting
you take the heat on this article

Nick begins to realize he is being fired

take comfort in knowing that I will not

Something that describes the dangers of

The American public is not affected by
mast head anymore They need photographs
We’ve done studies which show that
consumers react up to eighty percent more
to imagery rather than words The stats
are there It’s just sad that the Academy

Please state your name address and

My name is Nick Naylor I live at the
Watergate I am currently unemployed but
until recently I was the Vice President
of the Academy of Tobacco Studies

FINISTIRRE
Mr Naylor as Vice President of the
Academy of Tobacco Studies what was
required of you What did you do

NICK
I informed the public of all the research
performed in the investigation on the
effects of tobacco

FINISTIRRE
And what so far has the Academy
concluded in the investigation on the
effects of tobacco

NICK
Well many things actually Why just the
other day they uncovered evidence that
smoking can offset Parkinsons disease

FINISTIRRE
I’m sure the health community is
thrilled Mr Naylor Who provides the
financial backing for the Academy of
Tobacco Studies

NICK
Conglomerated Tobacco

FINISTIRRE
(clarifying)
That is the cigarette companies

NICK
For the most part yes

FINISTIRRE
Do you think this affects their
priorities

NICK
No Just as I’m sure campaign
contributions don’t affect yours

Senator LOTHRIDGE from Washington pipes in to break it up

LOTHRIDGE
Gentlemen Mr Naylor is not here to
testify on the goings on of the Academy
of Tobacco Studies We’re here to
examine the possibility of a warning
logo on cigarettes Now Mr Naylor I
have to ask out of formality do you
believe that smoking cigarettes over
time can lead to lung cancer and other
respiratory conditions such as
emphysema

Finistirre rolls his eyes (What do you think)
A long pause as Nick searches through everything The people
in this room The people watching on television The people

watching down from heaven

NICK
Yes

Finistirre looks up in astonishment as the whole room suddenly
bustles with energy Polly and Bobby Jay exchange glances

NICK
In fact I think you’d be hard pressed to
find someone who really believes that
cigarettes are not potentially harmful
(turns to audience)
I mean show of hands

LOTHRIDGE
Mr Naylor there is no need for
theatrics

NICK

I’m sorry I just don’t see the point in
a warning label for something people
already know

Senator DUPREE from Michigan joins in

DUPREE
The warning symbol is a reminder of the
dangers of smoking cigarettes

NICK
Well if we want to remind people of
danger why don’t we slap a skull and
crossbones on all Boeing Airplanes
Senator Lothridge

We notice for the first time Lothridge’s name plate says (D)
WASHINGTON

NICK
-» and all Fords Senator Dupree

Dupree’s name plate says (R) MICHIGAN

FINISTIRRE
That’s just ridiculous The death toll on
passenger planes and car fatalities
doesn’t even skim the surface of
cigarettes They don’t even compare

NICK
Oh this from a Senator who calls
Vermont home

Finistirre raises an eyebrow

LOTHRIDGE
I don’t follow Mr Naylor

NICK
Well the real demonstrated number-one
killer in America is cholesterol

Still stares Nick continues

NICK
And here comes Senator Finistirre whose
fine state is I regret to say clogging
the nation’s arteries with Vermont
cheddar cheese If you want to talk
numbers how about the millions of people
dying of heart attacks Perhaps Vermont
cheddar should come with a skull and
crossbones

FINISTIRRE
You little

Lothridge covers Finistirre’s mic so we don’t hear the word
“shit” Finistirre is fuming Lothridge cools him down

Nick looks back at Joey who gives him the thumbs up

LOTHRIDGE
Mr Naylor we are here to discuss
cigarettes Not any other products Now
as discussed earlier these warning
labels are not for those who know but
rather for those who don’t What about
the children

NICK
Gentlemen it’s called education It
doesn’t come off the side of a cigarette
carton It comes from our teachers and
more importantly our parents It is every
parents’ job to warn their children of
all the dangers of the world including
cigarettes So one day when they get
older they can make an educated choice
Not to be corny but that is what this
country is supposed to be all about Some
say it takes a village to raise a child
I disagree It takes two parents And
sometimes just one

Nick looks back at his son
NICK
I look at my son today and I can’t help
think of myself as responsible for his
growth and his development And I’m proud
of that

FINISTIRRE
In that case Mr Naylor would you
condone him smoking

NICK
Of course not he’s not eighteen That
would be illegal

FINISTIRRE
Yes I heard you deliver the same
response on 2020 But enough dancing
What about when he does turn eighteen

Nick is momentarily speechless

FINISTIRRE
Come on Mr Naylor On your son’s
eighteenth birthday will you share a
cigarette Enjoy the afternoon like one
of those sick tobacco advertisements You
certainly have a lot to say on how we
should raise our children What of your
own What will you do when he turns
eighteen

Joey looks to his father
Nick looks up at the various senators He takes a breath
NICK
If he really wants a cigarette I’ll
buy him his first pack
Joey smiles proudly

Finistirre rocks back

Of course he will This man here is our

retire

with tobacco
NICK
(smiles then)

Smoking is a personal freedom that is

enjoyed by countless Americans and

although I cannot smoke anymore due to my

injurious kidnapping I believe in

protecting all freedoms
Meanwhile as Nick continues we take a look at JOEY He’s so
proud of his dad So proud that he opens a pack of MARLBORO
REDS and pulls out a cigarette He takes it between his
fingers and raises it to his twelve year old LIPS
Out of the corner of Nick’s eye he sees his son about to lock
onto a cigarette And before Nick can stop himself his arm
whips down and SLAPS the cigarette out of his son’s mouth
We see this repeat through the eyes of the cameras
