CLOSE ON a word carved in stone DREAMS

BEGIN CREDITS

PULL BACK to reveal the full inscription

FOR IN THAT SLEEP OF DEATH WHAT DREAMS MUST COME

Its carved on a large obelisk grave marker Beneath the
inscription is a name THIBAULT and dates 1861-1917

PULL FURTHER BACK Perched on the marker is a stone effigy of
the angel of death wings spread wide half-smile on her
face

AND FURTHER BACK Ropes are wrapped around the marker The
ropes tighten and the marker is suddenly PULLED OVER the
CAMERA taking off with it --

The marker is dragged along through deep grass then with
a bump its on a dirt road then over a bridge Its dragged
by a team of horses Rain starts to fall The marker pulls
away continuing on toward --

Burgess Manor a dark outline against the gray marble sky --

END CREDITS

INT BURGESS MANOR - GARAGE - CIRCA 1930S - NIGHT

The garage was once the carriage house Several luxury cars
circa 1930s fill the bays The marker lies in an empty one
Two men stand nearby

One is RODERICK BURGESS A commanding presence radiating a
charisma both disturbing and mesmerizing He is in his early
twenties but his soul is much older -- and darker

The other is SMITH Middle-aged face drawn he peers out of
the garage furtively Hes worried preoccupied A white
clerical collar is almost hidden beneath his coat and scarf

SMITH
(hopefully)
The rain will wash out the tracks

Burgess moves slowly to the marker

BURGESS
Ive found it Crowley couldnt Mathers
couldnt Only I could

SMITH
I didnt see anybody on the
road

Burgess isnt listening to him hes preoccupied with the
marker He examines it gleefully reverently

BURGESS
Thibault had it stolen from the Vatican
Library -- thats common knowledge But

then it disappeared He told Yeats hed
destroyed it But he didnt He couldnt
And now -- Ive found it

SMITH
I dont think anyone saw me

Burgess finally looks at the man Cocks his head amused

BURGESS
Dont worry Vicar No one saw you No
one knows what youve done -- except you
and me And God
(insinuating)
Just like your other little

peccadilloes
The Vicar shuts his eyes in pain

SMITH
Please
(looks at Burgess)
What they say is true You are the most
wicked man alive

BURGESS
(chuckles)
Ive always liked that title

He grabs up a sledge hammer startling the other man -- as

he
intended He smiles and SMASHES the hammer down on the
marker Another blow Another --

The marker is hollow Hidden inside is a large oilskin
bundle Burgess drops the sledge Lifts out the bundle

Burgess unwraps it carefully Inside is a thick book

BURGESS
The Magdalene Grimoire Finally

The book is heavy leather bound brittle with age Burgess
pages through it greedily It is filled with tiny cramped
writing arcane diagrams drawings

SMITH
Thats it then You can do it now You
can capture the angel of death
BURGESS
Death isnt an angel Shes one of the
Endless who existed long before
angels and will exist long after the

final cherubim has sung its last hosanna

SMITH
Heresy

BURGESS

For your sake hope its not The
Magdalene Grimoire is all the Order of
Ancient Mysteries needed With it we
will summon and imprison Death

(beat)
And I will command who shall live and
who shall die

SMITH
Then youll keep our bargain
(no answer)
Please -- youll keep your promise
BURGESS

Of course Vicar You have my word You
wont die And you will never have to
stand in the judgment of your God

(clasps him on the shoulder cheery)
Good night

He exits the garage for the main house Smith looks down at
the marker at the shattered effigy of death

SMITH
Thank God --

He catches himself realizing he shouldnt be praying His
eyes fill with tears he slumps

SMITH
What have I done

INT BURGESS MANOR - CELLAR - NIGHT

Candles burn in the darkness Robed figures inscribe a large
circle on the floor -- chalk white against the black stone
Runic characters decorate it

ACOLYTE
It is midnight Lord Magus

BURGESS
It is time Elspeth love

A beautiful YOUNG WOMAN nods adoringly She crouches on all
fours at Burgess feet

Items are placed on her back a ceremonial bowl inside which
floats a human heart A long twisted knife A feather Coins
The Magdalene Grimoire She is a human altar

Burgess opens the book He begins to intone displaying the
items as he names them

BURGESS

I give you coin I made from a stone I
give you a song I stole from the dirt I
give you a knife from under the hills
And a stick I stuck through a dead mans
eye I give you a claw I ripped from a
rat I give you a name and the name is
lost

He jabs his forearm with the knife Blood drips onto the
feather

BURGESS (CONTD)
I give you blood from out of my vein and

a feather I pulled from an angels wing

He throws the feather into the circle
BURGESS (CONTD)
I summon with poison and summon with
pain I open the way and open the gates
Come

The acolytes echo the word Come
BURGESS (CONTD)
I summon you in the names of the old
lords Namtar Allatu Morax Naberius

Klesh Vepar Maymon We summon

The acolytes chant Come

BURGESS (CONTD)

From the dark they call you into the
dark they call you Coin and song knife
and stick

In the center of the circle the air SHIMMERS --

BURGESS (CONTD)
Claw and name blood and feather Here
in the darkness

The air SOLIDIFIES taking shape --
The acolytes echo Here in the darkness

BURGESS (CONTD)
Here in the darkness we summon you

together COME

There is FLASH --

-- and a black-cloaked FIGURE materializes in mid-air

His head and face are covered by a HELM that looks like the

skull of some dead ancient god (which it is)
A large vibrant heart-shaped RUBY adorns his neck

A small leather POUCH hangs from one hand

-- and then the figure collapses He lies splayed on the

floor in the center of the circle
The acolytes are hushed amazed

ACOLYTE
We did it I dont believe it We did it --
BURGESS

No We failed This isnt Death Damn it

to hell

Silence from the others as Burgess considers the figure

BURGESS
Even so strip him

The Acolyte nods reaches across the circle --

-- and SCREAMS as his arm TWISTS violently torqued by some
unseen force Burgess shoves him away from the circle

BURGESS
Fool If youd broken the circle he

could have escaped

He grabs Elspeth by the hair slashes with the knife --

Elspeths head lolls to one side Burgess catches her before
she collapses

ACOLYTE
My god --

Burgess lets Elspeth fall to the ground He holds his hands
up like a surgeon They are stained with Elspeths blood

Careful not to break the circle Burgess steps close to the
captured FIGURE With bloody hands he strips off the cloak

He takes the ruby

He takes the pouch

And then he removes the helm --

The face revealed is bone white framed by jet black hair An
aquiline nose and high cheekbones a face carved from finest
marble -- save the eyes These are obsidian deep as the
universe -- and staring directly at Burgess

He is the personification of dream

He is SANDMAN

Burgess draws back unsettled
BURGESS
(shaken)
I think at days end this will have
been a very profitable evenings work

With a gesture he orders the acolytes out Burgess continues
to stare at Sandman as he backs out of the room

The door to the room pivots on an axis the other side is
brick It is clearly a secret room The door swings shut

Sandman lies on the floor unmoving And then --
-- a single small tear slips down his cheek --

From somewhere in the empty room comes the SOUND of water
DRIPPING slowly In the corner a drop of water slips froma
pipe courses down the wall to the floor

DISSOLVE TO
EXT THE WORLD - VARIOUS

A scratchy recording of Dream a Little Dream of Me fades in
and out We see images drifting dreamlike drawn from news

INT BURGESS MANOR - CELLAR - CIRCA LATE 1940S - NIGHT

CLOSE ON Sandmans eyes Hes sitting up now hugging his
knees to his chest But still unmoving

Burgess nearly twenty years older sits in a chair opposite
him studying him

BURGESS
I know you can grant me boons Power
Immortality A promise you wont seek
revenge
(beat)
Well I know you can understand me Say
something

Sandman does not respond Does not move Just stares

BURGESS (CONTD)
Damn you
The door pivots and ALEX BURGESS pushes in Hes seven and
he wants nothing more than to please his father He carries a
large folio dusty and falling apart

ALEX
Sir I found it

BURGESS
Yes Alex

ALEX
See Here In the Paginarum Fulvarum

He leafs through the folio It is filled with old drawings
and paintings We catch quick glimpses of figures titled
Destiny Death Desire figures we will learn more of later

ALEX
You said he had to be one of the Endless
But it wasnt Death And its not Desire
or Despair -- or Destiny Thatd been
brilliant if youd caught him -- um

Burgess has fixed him with a stern look humbling him

ALEX (CONTD)
Uh anyway Here

He finds the drawing hes looking for displays it
A Heirmonyous Bosch-like portrait of Sandman in his helm and

cloak Terrifying The drawing is inscribed Here is said
thee Kinge of Dremes

ALEX (CONTD)
See Hes Dream

(reading)
Morpheus Lord Shaper the Prince of
Stories the Sandman

Burgess takes the folio examines it nodding

BURGESS
Yes I was hoping youd work it out on
your own one day And you have Well
done Alex

ALEX
Thank you father --
BURGESS
Father

ALEX
(chastised)
Thank you Lord Magus
(gathers his courage)
Sir Since you know his true name
cant you make him do what you want

BURGESS
Cretin That kind of magick is too
trifling for him and his ilk The Endless
are not mortal

ALEX
But if theyre gods --

BURGESS
They are not gods Gods come and go Gods
fade away

ALEX
But are we safe What if his brothers
and sisters come after us

Burgess broods on this glances at a shelf On it lie
Sandmans helm pouch and ruby He fingers the helm

BURGESS
Protection can be had Deals can be
struck
(to Alex)

Youve never seen a summoning have you
son Tonight you will Well conjure a
demon of hell And trade this --
(lifts the helm)
-- for our safety

BURGESS (CONTD)
(turns to leave)
Inform the acolytes

ALEX
Yes Lord Magus But what about what
about him

BURGESS
He will not get out unless the circle is
broken And the circle will not be broken
unless I order it

He leaves Alex trailing Sandman watches them go
In the corner a DROP of water slips from a pipe courses
down the wall to the floor Twenty years has worn a channel
in the stone the drop flows along it And then another

INT BURGESS MANOR - CELLAR - CIRCA 1960S - NIGHT

The door pushes open Burgess enters slightly drunk At
sixty hes still handsome and vital With him is --

RACHEL Beautiful in the extreme radiating sexual heat
Dressed in the counterculture style of the day She is

giggling -- then draws up short at the sight of Sandman
RACHEL
My God its true

She circles Sandman slowly

Alex now in his twenties has followed them into the room
he watches Rachels every step

RACHEL
Hes magnificent And you caught him
Lord Magus

Burgess smiles -- but it fades when Alex speaks
ALEX
Actually it was a mistake He was trying
to --

BURGESS

Shut up Alex
RACHEL
Is he a demon

BURGESS
(shakes his head)
Hes more dangerous than any demon Ive
known

He scoops up the pouch from the shelf

BURGESS (CONTD)
Here This is what I told you about
(opens the pouc
The stuff that dreams are made of

ALEX
(to himself)
Made on Quote it right you old idiot

He goes unheard as Burgess sprinkles some of the sand into
his own hand It sparkles He holds it out to Rachel

BURGESS
No matter how much you take out theres
always some left Try it

RACHEL
How do I Sniff it

BURGESS
Sniff it swallow it rub it on your skin
pour it in your eyes it doesnt

matter
Rachel considers Puts one finger in her mouth moistening
it rolls it in the sand With a wicked grin eyes never
leaving Burgess she trails her hand down toward her jeans --

Burgess stares panting slightly --

Her fingers slips beneath the waistband Between her legs --

BURGESS
Oh Rachel You are a wild one
She smiles shows her teeth -- her eyes go wide She is

seeing something beautiful rapturous She is seeing life as
a dream

RACHEL
Oh oh my

Roderick sets the pouch down moves to Rachel Begins to
nuzzle her neck undress her She responds to him --
-- but her eyes never leave the pouch

Alexs gaze lingers on Rachel as he backs away Then he steps
discreetly out of the room

And Sandman continues to watch and wait

INT BURGESS MANOR - CELLAR - NIGHT
The door opens Alex slips in followed by Rachel

RACHEL
Is he really what old Roddy says he is

ALEX
I dont know Stupid old Roddy
shouldve died by now and left me in
charge he really can work some sort
of magic

RACHEL
That sand that was magic

Alex grabs the pouch Considers then takes the ruby as well
He heads for the door Rachel catches him

RACHEL
Please just a little

Alex considers Opens the pouch Rachel pinches out some
sand sniffs it It takes effect immediately transporting

her Alex grabs her hand

ALEX
Come on

She pulls against him grabs for the pouch He lets her take
it She clutches it One last look at Sandman then she
allows herself to be led from the room

Sandman gazes after them

In the corner a DROP of water slips from the pipe courses
down the wall to the floor Flows along the channel which
now leads to a small pool

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

A man -- call him DAVID -- sleeps fitfully in the one-room
efficiency apartment He wears the pants and shirt of a
postal uniform the rest is scattered on the floor

The TV is on volume low showing Bicentennial celebration
news footage Traffic NOISE comes from outside mixed with
the sound of a DOG BARKING

All the sounds FADE OUT save the BARKING It becomes
rhythmic constant

Davids eyes flutter open

CORINTHIAN
Hello David

The CORINTHIAN is a young man with silver hair whipsaw build
clothed in white silk pants and T-shirt

He wears small round dark glasses and an amused smile

DAVID
Hello How did you get in here

CORINTHIAN
I wanted to talk to you David To tell
you that you are not fulfilling your
potential

DAVID
Im not Who are you

CORINTHIAN
Im your friend You can call me the
Corinthian I want to show you something

He gestures to the TV The dog continues to BARK

ON SCREEN what looks like the opening credits of a mid-
seventies cop show studio backlot heroics and car chases It
lingers on a POV shot approaching a parked red Torino Two
figures inside one blond one brunette -- both women Their
hair is almost ridiculously long and straight

David leans forward at the sight of the women His fists
clench The Corinthian smiles

CORINTHIAN
Ive shown other people things like this
David All through history But none as
special as you

ON SCREEN the POV shot continues A 44 appears in frame
and FIRES The windshield shatters and the brunettes head
snaps back -- a bloodless TV killing The blond looks up and
smiles

The gun FIRES again

Davids eyes fill with tears of joy The rhythmic BARKING
continues

CORINTHIAN
You see David If you can dream it --
you can be it

David saddens

DAVID
Thats all this is This isnt really
happening This is a dream

CORINTHIAN
Sadly yes Thats the only way Ive
ever talked to special people But
(David brightens)
Something has happened David And now
you can help me You can free me As I
can free you

DAVID
How

The Corinthian smiles spreads his hands

CORINTHIAN
Wake up David Just wake up

CLOSE ON David sleeping fitfully His eyes flutter open He
looks at the TV The bicentennial footage continues NORMAL
SOUND has returned
DAVID
Just a dream

A hand drops on his shoulder The Corinthians hand

CORINTHIAN
Not any more

He places something on the bed in front of David -- a 44
REVOLVER David picks it up reverently Heavy and real

CORINTHIAN
Good-bye David Thank you

He rises heads for the door
DAVID

Wait Will I ever see you again Will you
talk with me some more

The Corinthian pauses

CORINTHIAN
Ill always be here David Ill always
talk to you Just listen

Once again the SOUND fades away isolating the BARKING DOG

David listens nods The Corinthian nods back then opens the

door and leaves The door shuts quietly -- and NORMAL SOUND

returns

David lifts the revolver Spins the cylinder POINTS it at
the CAMERA --

CUT TO

INT BURGESS MANOR - CELLAR - CIRCA 1980S - NIGHT

Burgess leans heavily on a cane He is now a withered
fragile old man He stares at Sandman who stares back
Suddenly Burgess is wracked by a violent coughing attack
gets himself under control

BURGESS
Its your fault Damn you
(resigned)
You arent Death but you live forever
You havent aged a day since I caught
you You could have given me power beyond

He
my wildest dreams

(chokes back tears)
I I didnt have to get so old I
shouldnt have had to get old

He has another violent coughing attack Slips to one knee

DEATH
Thats it let it out

Another person is in the cellar She looks about nineteen
Long black hair pale skin A kinda groovy perky neo-punk
girl-next-door dressed in black jeans and camisole An ahnk
the Egyptian symbol for life hangs from her neck She looks
genuinely concerned for Burgess

And we recognize her face it was the face of the angel of
death on the grave marker

BURGESS
Who are you

She gestures He looks down Sees --

His own body Lying on the ground near his feet Dead

BURGESS
Are you you arent Death are you

DEATH smiles half-shrugs She knows shes not what he
expected

DEATH
Hi
BURGESS
I tried to catch you once Got him
instead
DEATH
I know
BURGESS
Am I are you going to punish me Am I

bound for hell

DEATH
Im just here to take you from this world
to the next Destinations are up to

you
BURGESS

Oh I am Im going to hell Im
Roderick Burgess Im the most wicked man
alive

DEATH

(a bright smile)
Not anymore

She takes Burgess hand Looks up at Sandman

DEATH
(genuine sadness)
Im sorry little brother theres
nothing I can do I I miss you

She and Burgess fade into the shadows We hear a SOFT
FLUTTERING SOUND like WINGS

Shes gone Just Burgess body on the floor And Sandman
watching The water still DRIPS the pool in the corner of
the room is quite deep now

EXT THE WORLD - VARIOUS
Images leading to the present day A student stands defiantly
in front of a tank An evangelist breaks down in tears A

white Bronco moves slowly down the freeway Demonstrators
join hands in a field of brightly colored quilts

INT BURGESS MANOR - CELLAR - PRESENT - NIGHT

In the corner a DROP of water slips from a pipe courses
down the wall to the floor Flows along the carved channel in
the stone into the pool --

The pool OVERFLOWS A line of water trickles its way across
the floor across the faded chalk runes of the circle It
wipes the line of chalk away --

The circle is broken

With a cry of pain Sandman falls forward collapses outside
the circle

He rolls over Weak In pain His lips part His voice is
filled with dark mystery a voice that can inspire dreams and
command nightmares
SANDMAN
At last

He gathers himself rises Stands a bit unsteady

He looks down at the remains of Roderick Burgess decayed and
brittle with age He picks up the skull Regards it

Sandman squeezes The skull SHATTERS There is no joy in his
eyes as pieces sift out from between his fingers

Sandman looks at the shelf that once held his belongings
Empty He looks away Moves toward the door --

EXT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Sodium lamps cast a sickly yellow light on the nearly-empty
lot A WOMAN hurriedly click-clacks toward her car keys

already out She unlocks the door opens it --

Someone slams it shut the CORINTHIAN He has seemingly
appeared from nowhere He smiles at her

CORINTHIAN
Beautiful night to be alive dont you
think

WOMAN

Stay away from me

She crouches slightly flexes her fingers Her red-painted
fingernails glint She knows self-defense The Corinthian
draws a knife lazily steps forward

The Woman kicks at his shin -- he avoids it But she brings
her foot down on his -- hard She grabs either side of his
head her thumbs clawing for his eyes behind his sunglasses --

She SCREAMS yanks her hands back She crouches staring down
at her hands which drip with blood

WOMAN
What did you do

The Corinthian straightens his sunglasses The woman crawls
under the car The Corinthian grabs her ankle -- she SCREAMS
clutches at the pavement grabs for the tire as she is
inexorably dragged out from under the car
CORINTHIAN (0OS)
Dont worry I wont kill you That would
draw all sorts of the wrong kind of
attention I just want to look into your
eyes --

Suddenly she is no longer being dragged She twists peers
out from under the car --

The Corinthian stands still looking up toward the night sky
CORINTHIAN
Hes back Hes BACK No Its not fair
I wont allow it I wont go back

He looks down at the woman

CORINTHIAN (CONTD)
Dont worry I can stop him Im not

going back
She cowers in terror Opens her eyes -- the Corinthian is
gone She blinks -- its as if he was never there --

-- except for her hands The Woman drags herself out from
under the car Raises her hands --

Her THUMBS BLEED as though bitten through by tiny sharp
teeth She starts to cry

EXT BURGESS MANOR - NIGHT

Boarded up windows broken overgrown Sandman stands under
the night sky Reaches out his arms Shadows move and
darkness stretches towards him

Sandman wraps the shadows around him --

-- and he is gone

EXT DREAM REALM - DUSK

A SANDSTORM rages there is the WHITE NOISE of the howling
wind Shadows flow inside of it and Sandmans dark outline
emerges one arm raised a shield against the wind He peers
ahead In front of him is
EXT DREAM REALM - THE GATES OF HORN AND IVORY - DUSK

Ornately carved Flanked by gargoyles Sandman is relieved at
the sight

SANDMAN
The Gates of Horn and Ivory Once
through I will see my castle I will

see --

The gates part before him Sandman steps through --

EXT DREAM REALM - SANDMANS PALACE - DUSK

SANDMAN
-- my home

Sandman stares in horror --

Ahead of him are the remains of Sandmans Dream Palace
Beautiful once but now overgrown and broken -- its glass
walls CRACKED its delicate spires BROKEN The majestic
columns have fallen into RUBBLE

Sandman slumps before it as if struck down From nearby comes
the sound of gentle weeping -- and a voice

LUCIEN (OS)
Breaks your heart my Lord doesnt it

Sandman turns

SANDMAN
Lucien

In the shadow of the gates sits LUCIEN Sandmans librarian
He rises to his feet Pointed ears and round spectacles
dressed as a clown might dress for a formal dinner

He stares at Sandman smiling tears in his eyes We realize
hes weeping at Sandmans return

LUCIEN
One and the same my Lord
(he bows)
At your service as always
(his voice cracks)
Welcome home

SANDMAN
What happened here

Lucien takes a breath Wipes the tears from his eyes

LUCIEN
What happened You are the incarnation of
this dreamtime Lord With you gone the
place it started to crumble

He takes off his spectacles cleans them

LUCIEN (CONTD)

I was aware of it in my Library Slowly
the words began to fade Some time after
you vanished my books became volumes of
blank paper The next day the whole
library was gone

(puts on his glasses)
I never found it again

SANDMAN
Im sorry Lucien

LUCIEN
I I tried sir I did my best We all
did

SANDMAN

Lets see how it is then

INT DREAM REALM - SANDMANS PALACE - HALLWAY - DUSK

Sandman moves through the ruined palace around fallen
columns and past broken statues

LUCIEN
(a sad fact)
Most of the palace servants turned back
into the dream stuff you made them with --

MATTHEW (OS)
Hes back Hes really back

A WILD FLAPPING SOUND and a sleek black raven -- MATTHEW
streaks down hovers in front of Sandman

MATTHEW
Where have you BEEN Are you all right
What happened

SANDMAN
I was detained

MATTHEW
Ha Detained You havent changed thats
good news

SANDMAN
Nor have you Matthew

Sandman surveys the devastation

MATTHEW
Its a pisser aint it

LUCIEN
It hurts me too lord

SANDMAN
Hurts yes Some power returns to me
simply by being here But I placed too
much of myself in my tools And they are
gone

He sits down on a broken marble stair

SANDMAN (CONTD)
I wonder I wonder if it is all even
worth rebuilding

Matthew speaks an aside to Lucien not all that quietly

MATTHEW
Hell I wonder if he can

Lucien shoots Matthew a scolding look

LUCIEN
My Lord -- some things you should know
items that need attention right away
Many of the nightkind are missing Lesser
dreams And
(he swallows)
One of the major nightmares

Sandman cocks an eyebrow waiting Lucien doesnt like being
the messenger

LUCIEN (CONTD)
The Corinthian Escaped into the waking
world Im afraid

Sandman turns away Before him is his reflection in a cracked
mirror hanging askew on a wall He looks up into his own
eyes a moment then away -- and in the mirror we get a
glimpse of a fat gray face -- DESPAIR

SANDMAN
How long

LUCIEN
Twenty years
SANDMAN

There is no telling the harm he may have
caused in that time

(beat)
I blame myself Had I been here
fulfilling my function

MATTHEW

Aww it wasnt your fault boss
SANDMAN

No Then whose

(beat)
And in my absence how much further
havoc has been visited upon the waking
world

Rose arrives at her entrance Paul close behind He looks
uncomfortable Rose packs her skateboard

PAUL
Hey lets go have lunch

ROSE
Im sorry -- Ive got too much to deal
with in my life right now Okay

Paul looks even more uncomfortable

PAUL
I was thinking just maybe we should
talk some more

ROSE
Paul no

PAUL
Rose --

Rose shoots him a look -- shes had enough Paul sees it

PAUL
Okay The truth of the matter is I know
all were going to be is great friends --
(cant help smiling)
But right now everybody in your whole
building is up with your roommate putting
together a surprise birthday party for
you and its up to me to keep you away
from there for the next two hours

Rose is completely shocked She glances toward her apartment

ROSE
Really

PAUL
Uh-huh Act surprised okay

ROSE
Okay
(back at Paul)
So um pals then
Paul regards her they smile An understanding reached

PAUL
Pals For now
(off her look)
And probably forever But I just dont
like saying never

ROSE
Okay Deal After all no one knows their

own destiny right

CLOSE ON The parchment PAGE of massive book In beautiful
illuminated script it reads

After all no one knows their own destiny
right
Rose said

In Destinys Garden Destiny closed his
book and went to his gallery

The huge tome is SHUT It is chained to the wrist of --
DESTINY Oldest of the Endless Tall wearing a hooded
cassock We are --

EXT DESTINYS GARDEN - TWILIGHT

Destiny moves through his Garden at a measured pace

assuredly as a blind man in his own familiar home Perhaps he
is blind as we do not see his eyes hidden in shadow
The garden is all Greek columns statues and sweeping
archways Paths that diverge and branch fork and divide
Tall hedge mazes immaculately cut --

But Destiny knows his way walking amid the sounds of
silence He leaves no footprints And casts no shadow

INT DESTINYS GARDEN - CITADEL - TWILIGHT

Destiny moves slowly dwarfed by the high-ceilinged hallway
Beyond chambers lead into many rooms and further chambers
He turns a corner disappears into SHADOW --

INT DESTINYS GARDEN - CITADEL - GALLERY - TWILIGHT

Six portraits hang on the wall all painted in romantic
style all the subjects garbed in eighteenth-century fashion

Destiny stops in front of the first painting -- an ornately-
framed oil portrait of Death she in an elegant pose Destiny
speaks his voice dry as dust

DESTINY
Sister I stand in my Gallery and I
summon the family to me It is I Destiny
of the Endless who calls you
(beat)
Come

Death EMERGES from out of her portrait into the hallway She
is her usual sunny self casually dressed

DEATH
Hiya big brother Whats up

DESTINY
I am calling a conclave of the Endless
Sister Do you not feel you should be
more appropriately attired
Death pouts then spins and is suddenly wearing a turn-of-

the-century satin dress black leather boots black silk
gloves The effect is at once wild and elegant

DEATH
Satisfied

Destiny moves to the next portrait He does not look at her
DESTINY
Yes I am satisfied
(to the portrait)
Sibling I stand in my Gallery and I
call you

DESIRE steps out from the portrait Perfectly symmetrical
perfectly androgynous features Her (or his) skin is pale as
smoke his (or her) eyes tawny and sharp as yellow wine
Desire smiles in brief flashes like moonlight glinting from
a knife-edge

She (or he) is formally dressed black corset panties
garters and stockings Desire looks around taking the place
in

DESIRE
(to Dream)
I see he hasnt redecorated in the last
three hundred years So whats the
occasion

DESPAIR
Destiny will tell us that in his own
time Desire He wont be rushed

DESPAIR emerges from her portrait a heavy woman naked
rolls of fat weighting her down Grey eyes that narrow to
tiny points

DESIRE
I see you dressed for the occasion
Despair

DEATH

Shush Be nice Its been years since the
family was together

Destiny passes a conspicuous gap where another painting may
have hung The next portrait is of a young girl smiling
holding flowers in a summer field

DESTINY
Sister Delirium Youngest of the Endless
I stand in my Gallery and I call you --
DELIRIUM steps into the Gallery -- looking not all like her

portrait Orange hair her fishnet stockings tattered One
eye is vivid emerald green spattered with silver flecks that
move her other eye is vein blue Who knows what Delirium
sees through her mismatched eyes

DEATH
Hi sis How are you doing

DELIRIUM
uh YesterDAY i did SomE really BAD
stuff I meaN REal bad YOU know
(beat)
but TOdAY i DiD some GOOD things I dont
knoW --

DESTINY
Hush little sister There is one more to
be summoned

At the end of the gallery is the portrait of Sandman dressed
in the finery of the 17th century Destiny pauses in front of
it --

INT DESTINYS GARDEN - CITADEL - MAIN HALL - TWILIGHT
Sandman dressed as he was painted sits at a seven-sided

table The Endless gathered around Destiny stands behind his
chair There is one extra chair standing empty

DESTINY
You know why I have called this family
meeting

DESPAIR

Brother Dream is back
(glances at the empty chair)
I thought you had gone for good

DESIRE
Abandoned his realm abandoned his
responsibilities

SANDMAN
I had no choice in the matter

DELIRIUM

DesTiNY couLD hAVe Told yOu WHAT was
ComINg BUT he wouldnt cAUse hes meAN

DESTINY
I could not turn that page until it was
time for the turning But I can tell you
what has occurred in your absence

DESIRE
Oh do This could be fun

Sandman gestures for Destiny to continue

DESTINY
The dreams of men became chaotic One
mans dream could infect thousands
Dreams of freedom of subjugation dreams
of equality dreams of death Dark or
light made no matter if the dreamer
strong enough

Delirium pays no attention Bright butterflies emanate from
her fingertips

DELIRIUM
i juST made butter-flies LOOK
everyBody LOOk at whaT I just DiD

DESTINY
Brother Dream You must decide Will you
repair your kingdom and return to your
throne

SANDMAN
I am not sure that I am needed Or that I
wish to resume my mantle

Desire leans forward

DESIRE
I could make you wish to

Sandman frowns
DESIRE
I am Desire am I not Where I touch
things want and need and love drawn like

butterflies to a candle-flame

DESPAIR
You mean moths

Desires smile widens

DESIRE
Butterflies

One of Deliriums butterflies lands on a candle flame It
BURNS quickly writhing leaving only colored smoke The
image is at once repellent and beautiful

DELIRIUM
thoSe Were MINE you didnt HaVe to do
thaT

DESPAIR

We should not argue We should not fight

Sandman looks across the table at Death

SANDMAN
You have been quiet sister What say
you

DEATH

What say I Well Ill tell you And Im
only going to say it once so youd
better pay attention

She rises and comes around the table to him He waits

DEATH (CONTD)
You are utterly the stupidest most self-
centered appallingest excuse for an
anthropomorphic personification on this
or any other plane

She sits on the table beside him

DEATH (CONTD)
What we do arent just responsibilities
These arent just jobs We didnt answer
ads in the classifieds because we wanted
the health care Destiny Desire Death --
this is what we are And you -- are
Dream

Her stern attitude fades and she takes his hand
DEATH (CONTD)
Im glad youre back I was worried about
you
She kisses his cheek then moves back to her chair
Sandman rubs his forehead decides
SANDMAN
I will repair my kingdom To do so I must

recover my tools of power Pouch Helm
and Ruby

DESTINY
(nods)
The path is chosen then

SANDMAN
But I dont know where they are Brother
could you

Destiny does not respond but pulls his book closer

SANDMAN (CONTD)
No Of course not Sisters can you be of
any assistance

Hes addressing Desire Delirium and Despair who are grouped
together -- a tableau of Mother Maiden and Crone

SANDMAN
My pouch of sand which controls dreams
Do any of you have knowledge of it

DELIRIUM
i kNow I KNoW TheRes a WOman namED
Rachel -- she haS IT BuT I donT KNoW

where SHe is NeiTHeR doeS ShE

Delirium shuts her mismatched eyes furrows her brow When
she opens her eyes again they are both BLUE

DELIRIUM
Rachel remembers another Rose Walker
Perhaps she can lead you to your pouch
(rubs her temples)
It hurts me to be this way

SANDMAN
Then stop

Deliriums eyes shift back to one green one blue
DELIRIUM
DesTINy Im SORry I didnt MEaN to calL
you meAn I mean i meant to bUt I

didnt MEAN it whEN I meant To

DESTINY
I know

Delirium smiles
SANDMAN
My Dreamstone my Ruby Moonstone which
can alter the fabric of reality Where is
it

Desire seems to enjoy answering

DESIRE
A very desirable item hm Stolen from a
king by a mage stolen from a mage by a
thief And thats the last I know of it
(a knifes-edge smile)
Sorry

Sandman scowls Then turns to Despair

SANDMAN
And my helm of office which protects me
between realms

DESPAIR
It was traded to a demon long ago It now
abides in Hell I am too familiar with
that place

Sandman does not like this news

SANDMAN
Thank you

He rises leaves the table

EXT DESTINYS CITADEL - TWILIGHT

Sandman stands on a balcony looking out over Destinys
garden Death joins him

SANDMAN
My ruby is missing And I am not strong
enough to face a single demon let alone
the hordes of hell

DEATH
So the pouch

SANDMAN
Yes My sister I pray you tell our
siblings that I was needed elsewhere and
I could not stay

He kisses her hand and starts to fade away

SANDMAN
Adieu

Hes gone Death bites her lip

DEATH
Great Now I get to worry about him some
more

EXT ALEXANDERS YACHT - EVENING

A 150-foot white yacht sleek huge engines built for speed
and show a testament to ego rather than seaworthiness
Anchored far away from shore Silent and dark save for
lights in the galley and a forward cabin

INT ALEXANDERS YACHT - GALLEY - EVENING

Plush and elegant Long center table huge refrigerator
Quiet cavernous and empty A door opens --

Its ALEXANDER BURGESS No longer the young Burgess hes
in his fifties now -- and looks older Silk robe pajamas
unkempt hair shuffling along he is a shocking contrast to
the opulence of his ship

CLOSE ON a tray as Alexander carefully places five celery
sticks in line Each celery stick is exactly the same length
INT ALEXANDER YACHT - CAPTAINS CABIN - EVENING

Alexander pushes into the cabin carrying the tray A huge
bed marble and wood appointments -- this is a yacht Donald
Trump might have owned

On the bed is the body of a muscular young man Dead

ALEXANDER
Carlos

CORINTHIAN
Alexander Burgess I presume

The Corinthian is standing to one side of the door Alexander
drops the tray reaches into his robe draws a gun froma
holster at his side --
The Corinthian moves swiftly a single blow --

Alexander crumples to the deck and SCREEN FADES TO BLACK

INT ALEXANDERS YACHT - CAPTAINS CABIN - EVENING

FADE UP CLOSE ON ALEXANDER lying where he fell His eyes
open -- slightly He shifts his eyes only glancing around

POV ALEXANDER -- he sees the Corinthian moving about the
cabin searching Photos on the walls show scenes from huge
and decadent parties -- liquor drugs beautiful women
powerful men The Corinthian looks at them shakes his head

CORINTHIAN
(to himself)
Oh my such decadence

He moves past examines an empty wall Lingers there
CORINTHIAN
Dear Alexander you spent a lot of
time here didnt you It stinks of worry
He glances at a trail we cant see
CORINTHIAN
Youve worn a path And stood here for
long periods of time
He reaches up -- a hidden switch behind a bookcase slides

back a section of marble revealing a safe Without looking

CORINTHIAN
(to Alexander)
Get up Youve been awake for the past
two minutes Your breathing betrays you

Alexander opens his eyes struggles to sitting He begins to
weep -- not in terror but in resignation He wipes his eyes

with both hands

ALEXANDER
I knew it had to happen

CORINTHIAN
Yes well you shouldnt have written
the book Led me right to you

He flings a book off the shelf down in front of Alexander
LORD MAGUS The Truths of Roderick Burgess by Alexander
Burgess Alexander looks at it

ALEXANDER
Stupid But I had to to

CORINTHIAN
Pay penance Set the record straight
Make a fortune off the movie sale

Alexander laughs mirthlessly

ALEXANDER
Hardly Youre probably the only one
whose ever read the damn thing
(beat)
Want me to sign it

CORINTHIAN
No

ALEXANDER
The Ruby
CORINTHIAN
Yes

Alexander stands moves to the safe

ALEXANDER
Is Carlos dead

CORINTHIAN
Yes Your lover

Alexander works the dial

ALEXANDER
(shakes his head)
Pilot and body guard I havent had much
interest in lovers -- male or female --
in a long time Although I had my share
of both once

He pulls the safe open It is empty save for SANDMANS RUBY
set on a velvet pad He takes it out
ALEXANDER
This gave them to me It gave me
everything I ever desired

CORINTHIAN
(mock tragic)
Except the one thing you ever really
wanted Your fathers love

Alexander makes a fist around the Ruby Hurls it at the
Corinthian -- who makes an effortless one-handed catch He
holds it up to the light then pockets it Draws his knife

ALEXANDER
Youre going to kill me now

CORINTHIAN
I believe so

ALEXANDER
With a knife How prosaic
(a bitter laugh)
I bought the yacht for safety Open
water supposed to guard against magic

attack

CORINTHIAN
Your father was right Alexander You are
an idiot

Alexander winces The Corinthian moves to Carlos body turns
the corpses head He works his knife as he speaks

CORINTHIAN (CONTD)
You had the Ruby Moonstone of the King of
Dreams Reality itself in your sway And
all you could do was feed your callow
little hungers

He holds up his prize AN EYEBALL He lifts it to his face --
we think he may eat it With his free hand he reaches up to
remove his sunglasses --

CORINTHIAN (CONTD)
Not that I take issue with indulging
pleasures

Alexander gasps at what is revealed behind the Corinthians
sunglasses
CLOSE ON THE CORINTHIANS MOUTH He brings the eyeball
closer --

-- and past up out of frame EVEN AS HE SPEAKS (CLEARLY)
WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF CHEWING --

CORINTHIAN (CONTD)
But you never understood how to truly use
the Stone You had the power to change
the whole world And you wasted it

Alexander is stricken His knees buckle He slumps to the
floor And then we see what he has seen

The Corinthians eye sockets DO NOT HAVE EYES -- instead
they are both MOUTHS filled with SHARP TEETH When he
speaks all three of his mouths speak -- three voices
overdubbed

CORINTHIAN

But thats pretty much true of all you
mortals isnt it

He brings his bloody knife up and advances

ALEXANDER
Who are you
CORINTHIAN
(melodramatic)

Im your worst nightmare Im --
(shrugs smiles)
Thats it Your worst nightmare
He LAUGHS --

CUT TO

EXT OCEAN - EVENING

The Corinthian sunglasses back on pilots the yachts launch
across the bay

He takes the Ruby from his pocket holds it up looking
through it at the city

POV - THROUGH THE RUBY Everything is tinted red And as the
Corinthian turns the Ruby its facets distort the city
distort reality
CLOSE ON - A DOZEN smiling PARTY-GOERS as they yell --

PARTY-GOERS
SURPRISE

Roses eyes widen and she looks appropriately surprised we
are --

INT ROSES APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A banner reads Happy Birthday Rose The party-goers
mostly tenants crowd forward A cake with one big candle on
it is proffered Rose blows it out pushes through Paul
behind her

Among the guests are KELLY a chubby young woman with a good
heart SAMANTHA who smokes too many French cigarettes

KELLY
Were you surprised

ROSE
(a la Roz Russell)
Im a cynical old woman now Nothin
surprises me

Samantha holds up a little white KITTEN

ROSE
(a mercurial change)
Oh -- oh look at it Is it mine

SAMANTHA
Happy birthday Rose

Rose takes the Kitten pets it coos to it

SAMANTHA (CONTD)
I thought you needed something in your
life cute and warm and fuzzy and
demanding and I didnt know any men so

KELLY
I wasnt sure youd like it --

ROSE
No no its perfect Purr-fect I
love it
KELLY
She needs a name

ROSE
Its a she Thats easy Her names

Dinah

She moves away kitten clinging to her shoulder

KELLY
Dinah
SAMANTHA
Oh -- like in Alice in Wonderland You

know Rose

Other partygoers wish Rose happy birthday pet the kitty
Rose smiles to everyone thanking them moving through the

crowd --

INT ROSES APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Tired Rose collapses into a chair The kitten burrows behind

her neck Someone offers a glass of wine --

Paul Rose takes it from him Smiles

ROSE
So can I at least imagine I inspired
you and you were able to get back to
work

PAUL
I wish No still blocked I havent
painted in months is it months

Shit And you know about the sleep
trouble Ive been having this weird
dream

Kelly questing for snacks overhears this last

KELLY
A weird dream You gotta tell Sam
shes a nut for this stuff Sam come
here
(Sam joins them)
Hes going to tell us a dream

SAMANTHA
Ragin So tell

Paul hesitates -- it really wasnt for everybody to hear

now hes on the spot

but

PAUL
I dreamt I was climbing a rock face this
sheer like spire --and I hate to climb
I hate high places in general Im an
artist and I dont even open my windows
to look at the view --

KELLY
The dream
PAUL
Right So Im climbing and Ive reached

the top

EXT DREAM REALM - ROCKY SPIRE - DAY

Its Pauls dream A finger of stone pushes its way into a
pale blue sky At the pinnacle Paul maintains a perilous
hold his face white with terror

PAUL (CONTD) (VO)
I cant go higher I cant climb all the
way back down And I cant let go I
cant fall

INT ROSES APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Remembering Paul speaks nervously -- hes genuinely
troubled

PAUL (CONTD)
I just cant Because if you fall ina
dream and you hit the ground -- you die
Right

KELLY
I think thats just an old wives tale

SAMANTHA
I tend to trust old wives

PAUL
So ah I figure its about being
blocked Right

SAMANTHA
It sounds like an anxiety dream

KELLY
It always sounds like an anxiety dream to
you Unless its a sex dream

ROSE
What if you dream about being anxious
about sex

KELLY
Is that what you dream about

Rose is suddenly uncomfortable

ROSE
I dont dream Never have

SAMANTHA
You mean you dont remember

Rose takes a drink looks away and spots --

SANDMAN Wearing a plain leather jacket giving the party a
detached once-over The guests flow around him seemingly
unaware of his presence

SAMANTHA (0S)
(to Paul)
So this spire basically long and
phallic And youre clinging to it huh

Curious Rose moves toward Sandman -- almost drawn to him

PAUL (0OS)
Whoa wait a second --

Rose gazes speculatively at Sandman She scoops up a Chinese
fortune cookie from a snack bowl Steps forward startling
him

ROSE
Hi So are you being lonely or just
aloof

Sandman glances around for the person she is addressing --
then realizes it must be him

SANDMAN
You noticed me

ROSE
Yeah it wasnt hard I looked behind
the philodendron and there you were

SANDMAN
I am not usually noticed unless I wish to
be

Rose quickly realizes hes a weirdo decides to bail

ROSE
(turning away)
Ah okay Ninja-boy Well have fun
lurking

Sandman catches her arm

SANDMAN
Wait I require your assistance

ROSE
My assistance

SANDMAN
I am searching for a possession of mine
A leather pouch full of sand

Rose looks afraid She knows what hes talking about but
wishes she didnt

ROSE
A pouch

SANDMAN
A woman named Rachel stole it I want it
back

ROSE
Then go get it And leave me the hell
alone

She pulls away from him She crosses to a window and climbs
out onto the fire escape

EXT ROSES APARTMENT - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

Rose nuzzles the kitten A beat and then Sandman moves to
beside her -- although he did not seem to come out the

window

SANDMAN
My sister did not know the womans
location nor am I able to sense the
pouch Do you know where she is

Roses words spill out the venom unmistakable

ROSE
Rachel is my mother My mother the
junkie
She was stoned when I was conceived she
was stoned when I was born she was

stoned she is always stoned The
state finally took me away

ROSE (CONTD)
I hear from her once in a while --
when she remembers she maybe had a kid
somewhere
(a bitter laugh)
Happy birthday

SANDMAN
Then you do know where she is

ROSE
I know where she was a year ago

SANDMAN
Take me to her I will grant you a boon

Rose stares at him -- this is absurd
ROSE
A boon
SANDMAN
Yes
ROSE

Like a gift Like in a fairy tale That
kind of boon

SANDMAN
Yes I am Dream of the Endless I am the
Master of Dreams If it is within my
power you shall have it

Roses expression is one of surprise -- but not quite
disbelief
SANDMAN
And I need your help

Rose is skeptical -- but she is considering it
SANDMAN (CONTD)
(a single desperate syllable)
Please

Rose softens -- he is in genuine need

ROSE
This is too weird My mother

She looks down at the fortune cookie in her hand Looks up at
Sandman into his eyes They gaze at each other a moment and
something passes between them Understanding Trust

Roses mouth curls in a sly smile Cracks the fortune cookie
extracts the fortune Reads it Shakes her head

ROSE
(reading the fortune)
Be open to new experiences

She looks again at Sandman Sighs
ROSE
All right We really dont get to choose
these things do we Ill take you there
Sandman nods gratefully
ROSE
But that doesnt mean I believe you What

a line The Master of Dreams Yeah
right

EXT RACHELS HOUSE - NIGHT

A very bad neighborhood A taxi screeches away from the curb
Sandman stands on the sidewalk Rose beside him

The house is one step above condemned Tall brown weeds and
broken windows flaking paint and decaying siding

SANDMAN
The pouch is here
ROSE
How do you know

SANDMAN
I know

Rose steps up to the house rings the bell Checks the
