Gerry Dex Where are you

GERRY (V0)
Home waiting for the fireworks to
start The armys going to put the
hammer down in a way nobodys seen
since God smote Sodom and Gomorrah

EXT PHILADELPHIA - FRANKLIN SQUARE -- DAY

Six-companies of soldiers many wearing bio-contamination
suits fan out across the choke point leading from the Benjamin
Franklin Bridge forming a massive firing line Other soldiers
build up sandbags and take position behind tanks as --

-- panicked civilians race across the bridge toward them
escaping some enemy we dont see yet Soldiers bark orders
urging them to hurry

Media helicopters swarm overhead while military choppers hang
back Tanks Bradleys Humvees mortars and trucks with
satellite gear roll up behind the soldiers

HARD CUT BACK TO BLACK UNDER

DEXTER (V0O)
Gerry --

GERRY (V0O)
According to the news theyve got it
contained The army set down
barricades all along the river to
force every Z2 coming toward
Philadelphia up over the Ben Franklin
Bridge and the Deleware Expy into a
clean kill zone in Franklin Square

EXT PHILADELPHIA - FRANKLIN SQUARE

Several hundred shadowy ambiguous forms start to move into
the streets that lead to the square A soldier receives a
transmission on his helmet radio yells to the rest

SOLDIER
Fire in the hole

World War Z 72207 2

They hit the ground as a Comanche helicopter behind them fires
two ROCKETS They BURST into a hundred smaller bomblets which --

-- EXPLODE over the enemy causing SECONDARY EXPLOSIONS as
they ignite the gas tanks of abandoned cars Thick black
smoke swallows the scene

The troops CHEER Media choppers SWING IN for a closer look
BACK TO BLACK UNDER

DEXTER (V0O)

GerryI need you to pay very close
attention

(beat)
Remember when you were doing that
report for the UN on Afghanistan and
I called you right before the Taliban
hit the village where you were staying
and told you to get the hell out

GERRY (V0O)
Yeahyou were on the night shift at
CIA Langley when the raw intelligence
came in and --

DEXTER (V0O)
Then listen to me right now

EXT PHILADELPHIA - FRANKLIN SQUARE

Through the smoke we can make just out hundreds of bodies
that lay unmoving on the ground Then slowly we see other
figures shuffling and shambling toward us Lots of them

INT GERRYS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

GERRY LANE 30s is on the cell phone looking out the twelfth-
story window to the city below long enough for us to take it
in His wife KARIN is watching the TV news She gasps at
what she sees He turns to look at the TV UNDER

DEXTER (VO)
Get the hell out Gerry Get the
hell out of Philly right now

GERRY
Oh my god

EXT PHILADELPHIA - FRANKLIN SQUARE

For the first time emerging from the smoke we see the enemy
thousands of zombies that SURGE toward us wiping us into a --

World War Z 72207 3
MONTAGE

-- with each shot designed to look and feel heroic emphasizing
the bravery and skill of the soldiers in battle

Heavy bombardment by artillery Comanche helicopters fire
rockets and bomblets Soldiers blaze away with automatic
weapons from behind cover while others advance bravely into
the front linesonly to be overwhelmed by --

-- the wave of Zombiesmore and more pouring in as --

-- cannons and chain-guns on tanks and Humvees BLAST out at
the approaching tide shredding the first rows and blowing up
buildings on either side Rockets slam into buildings all
around them but their eyes never leave the soldiers intense
intent determined

Hundreds of mortar rounds explode transforming the road into
hell incarnate --

-- as the tide of Zombies washes over the defenders a pitched
battle that seems to go on forever until a falling body WIPES
CAMERA as we go --

BACK TO BLACK UNDER

DEXTER (VO)
Gerry Are you there Gerry

But theres only the electronic beep-beep-beep of a cell phone
system gone dead The sound FADES OUT SLOWLY then we

HARD CUT INTO
EXT STREETS - PHILADELPHIA -- DAY

The streets are a nightmare of unprecedented magnitude Terror
and chaos on the half-shell Cars blast the wrong way down
one way streets onto sidewalks crashing into other cars or
even pedestrians in their frenzy to get the hell out of town
Looters haul supplies out of shattered stores Cars and buses
are on fire

Gerry is behind the wheel of one of the cars trying to escape
With him are Karin and their daughters four-year old CONSTANCE
and eight-year-old RACHEL Constance is crying terrified

as Gerry swerves in and out of traffic avoiding fires looters
and other cars

KARIN
Its all right honey everythings
okay Were just going on a road
trip Constance sweetie theres
nothing to be afraid of Youre safe
Mommy and daddy are right here we --

World War Z 72207 4

Gerry SWERVES to avoid slamming into a truck The near-
accident amps up Constances crying Then we begin to hear
something new over the traffica distant ROAR

KARIN
Whats that sound Gerry

He sticks his head out through the window and looks up

An out-of-control Boeing 757 is hurtling through the air upside
down heading right toward us

GERRY
HOLD ON

He GUNS the engine side-swiping cars knocking aside anything
in the way as the plane tumbles and rolls overhead and --

-- the plane is barely hundreds of feet overhead as we PUSH
IN on one of its windows where for one frozen moment out of
time we SEE --

-- passengers and zombies STRUGGLING with one another the
scene inside totally out of control as the airplane --

-- SLAMS into the center of Philadelphia and EXPLODES as --

-- Gerry speeds away barely getting clear of the blast zone
as we CRANE UP to reveal Philadelphia floating in a smear of
black smoke and fire

EXT USED CAR LOT -- DAY

Karin holds Rachel and Constance as across the lot Gerry
talks with a salesman who nods to an older model RV big
enough for a family Gerry hands him a wad of cash and the
keys to his car The salesman goes inside to get the paperwork
as Gerry hustles over to Karin

KARIN
Gerry what are you doing Thats
three times what that crate is worth

GERRY

Doesnt matter If Dex is right
money wont be worth a damn soon
anyway

(includes Rachel)
Okay we need to get everything out
of the car and into the RV so we can
hit the road as fast as possible

RACHEL
But I liked the car

World War Z 72207 5

GERRY
It wont do us any good where were
going Now come on

He leads them back toward the car
INT RV-- AFTERNOON

Gerry drives the RV down a long rural road Karin seated
beside him Constance asleep on a back seat and Rachel perched
at a window looking forlornly out at the passing scenery

RACHEL
I dont like this thing It smells
like old people

KARIN
Itll pass honey as soon as we can
air it out a bit

GERRY
(to Karin)
Keep your eyes open for any stores or
supermarkets thatre still open We
have to hit every one we find until
were out of money Well need flares
candles first aid supplies water --

KARIN
What about food

GERRY
Dry smoked salted or in cans nothing
perishable

KARIN

Not even frozen

GERRY
Keeping the freezer going means running
the engine and well need to conserve
gas Get a few things for now but
nothing long term itll just spoil
Once the snows come we can use that
to keep things cold

RACHEL
I dont understand where are we going
GERRY
Were going North
RACHEL
Why
GERRY

Because winters coming

World War Z 72207

RACHEL
But wont it be cold

GERRY
Thats the idea See before Daddy
started working for the UN he went
to college with a friend named Frank
Dexter who works for the CIA now and
he told Daddy --

RACHEL
You shouldnt talk about yourself in
the third person its creeping me
out

He looks to Karin who shrugs

KARIN
She got an A in grammar this semester

GERRY

Anyway my friend got a report from
Finland where its a lot colder than
it is here Theyre having the same
problem as us and they discovered
that when the snows come it doesnt
make any difference whether youre
alive or --

(beat)
-- or whatever sooner or later a
body exposed to extreme cold stops
moving When the snows come itll
stop those things in their tracks

RACHEL
Does it destroy them

GERRY
We dont know It may just put them
to sleep But with luck itll keep
them asleep long enough for the
government to get things under control

RACHEL
So what about all the people in the
south
GERRY
I dont know honey I dont know
(beat)

Anyway thats why were going north
away from the big cities and off the
beaten track near the Canadian border
Fewer people means fewer problems
Think of it as a big camping trip

World War Z 72207 7
RACHEL
Why dont we just go somewhere the
zombies arent
Another awkward pause then
GERRY
Because there isnt any such place
sweetie
EXT RV-- EVENING

The RV roars off past a freeway sign WOLFE ISLANDCAPE VINCENT
CANADIANUS BORDER CHECKPOINT 120 MILES

EXT ROADWAY - MORNING
The RV moves down on a little-used back road
INT RV

Gerry is exhausted having driven through the night Karin
wakes up in the back comes to him

KARIN
You want me to drive for a while

GERRY
Im okay but some coffee would help

She starts to move back when she sees a car ahead thats gone
off the road A WOMAN in her 50s is flagging them down

Gerry hesitates not sure if he should stop Karin nods
They pull over and open the front door The woman approaches

WOMAN
Thank god --

GERRY
What happened

WOMAN
A bunch of those things came at my
house last night I lit out figured
if I drove with my lights off they
wouldnt see me but that didnt work
out quite like I planned

Gerry looks to her arm Its bandaged

GERRY
What happened there

She glances to the wound nervously tries to dismiss it

World War Z 72207 8

WOMAN
Nothingjust a cut Let me get my
things and Ill be right back

She hurries off Gerry exchanges an agonizing look with Karin
and the meaning is implicit what if she was bit

KARIN
Gerry --

GERRY
We cant take the chance

She wants to arguebut knows she cant Before the woman
can come back Gerry closes the door The RV rumbles off as
Rachel watches her recede into the distance

RACHEL
Mom Why did youshes all alone

Karin fighting back tears doesnt answer

KARIN
Ill get the coffee going

And the woman waving for help disappears into the horizon
EXT ROADSIDE - NIGHT

The RV has pulled over for the night along a high ridge a
sheer drop on one side nearly impossible to approach

INT RV- CONTINUOUS

Karin and Gerry are watching a small portable TV Rachel and
Constance asleep They fiddle with the antenna annoyed at

the snowy reception The news on-screen shows snarled freeways
and panicked crowds

TV ANCHOR
-- as the infection continues to spread
across the country aided in part by
the panic that has sent millions of
people fleeing the major cities into
the suburbs and the countryside often
taking the infection with them

Katrina-like footage of thousands of people loaded up with
whatever they can carry clogging shelters or on the road

TV ANCHOR
Refugees from the areas most heavily
hit by the infection continue to
overwhelm emergency shelters and pour
into neighboring states many of which
have set up patrols to keep these
refugees out by any means necessary

World War Z 72207 9

We SEE people trying to get across a bridge only to be met
by weapons fire from waiting police and national guard forces

TV ANCHOR
Homeland Security officials are
pleading with the public to stay off
the roads and let the military do its
job but since the fall of Philadelphia
that plea carries little weight
especially in light of the decision
made earlier today to evacuate the
White House

Now helicopters on the White House lawn take off as similar
choppers rise from the Capitol Building

TV ANCHOR
The President Vice President his
cabinet and their families were taken
to an undisclosed location along with
members of Congress and other officials
needed to deal with the current crisis
sometimes with only moments to spare

A horde of zombies penetrate the barricades as the last chopper
takes off It feels very much like the fall of Saigon

TV ANCHOR
After the evacuation military forces
pulled back to areas that could be
more easily secured abandoning
Washington to the infected
(beat)
We repeatWashington has fallen

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

The RV lumbers down a narrow mountain road never meant for
vehicles of this size barely making it to --

EXT CAMPGROUND - DAY

-- where several campers are already parked As the RV comes
to a stop several MEN approach led by STAN ROSEN 50s
Theyre armed but not threatening Gerry appears in the door

GERRY
Hiis there a problem

STAN
Im Stan Rosen were the welcome
committee Just want to make sure
youre not carrying anybody infected
with you Is that okay

GERRY
I suppose

World War Z 72207 10
Stan nods to one of the men who enters the RV

STAN
Dont worry were not after your
stuff Since we got here first we
made the rules everybody lives off
what they bring with them or catch
No stealing or begging for food or
supplies from anybody else Trade
barter those are fine but nobody
brings a stranger into camp Other
than that youre welcome

The man emerges

MAN
Theyre good

The welcome committee visibly relaxes Stan extends a hand

STAN
Make yourself at home I11 check
back after youve settled in

They head away Gerry puts on his best face for Karin

GERRY
Its perfect No cities or towns for
thirty miles Nobody infected Well
be safe here

But she looks dubious as Rachel watches the men head away

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CAMPGROUND -- AFTERNOON

Theres a dusting of snow on the ground More campers RVs
mobile homes have arrived along with a scattering of cars
Not a crowd but enough to notice

TV ANCHOR (VO)
I repeat this will be our last
broadcast

INT RV- CONTINUOUS

Karin and Gerry are watching a static-riddled news broadcast
The anchor is exhausted the camera work ragged

TV ANCHOR
Electricity is out across most of the
country so were using the last of
our emergency backup power for this
final transmission

World War Z 72207 11

Karin holds Gerry a little closer as the anchor continues
they are losing their last lifeline to the outside world

TV ANCHOR
The President speaking from an
emergency command center at Mount
Weather in Virginia today announced
evacuation orders for the entire
country

The PRESIDENT appears on-camera

PRESIDENT

First we ask that all citizens located
in the suburbs or countryside evacuate
immediately to the nearest large city
Defense procedures have been set up
to protect these islands of security
which have been designated red zones
If you remain outside of a red zone
we cant protect you

(beat)
Second we will evacuate some of the
population of each state to areas
that are more difficult for the
infecteds to reach inside secluded
valleys on islands or in other
isolated regions Because they will
not require a heavy military presence
putting some of our citizens -- chosen
by lottery -- into these green zones
will insure that our country continues
and allow us to concentrate our efforts
on defending the red zones which
remain our primary concern

The picture returns to the anchor as a crawl of various local
addresses appears on-screen

TV ANCHOR
For those without transportation to
the nearest red zones army trucks
will come by the pickup centers listed
below for the next several days
Well have more information later
regarding the lottery for relocation
to the green zones

KARIN
Should we take a chance on it

GERRY
Nothe roads are full of those
things wed never make it to the
nearest pickup point

(MORE)

World War Z 72207 12

GERRY (CONTD)
Besides theyre going to have to
bring in food for the cities that
means riots maybe starvationwere
better off here

They turn their attention back to the TV for

“TV ANCHOR
When France England and Australia
announced similar emergency evacuation
orders some officials described it
as the Radeker plan after the
controversial South African figure
Paul Radeker Later however sources
with Homeland Security labeled this a
misunderstanding saying that the
plan was developed through consultation
with FEMA and local emergency agencies

Gerry looks out the window to see Stan leading his fourteen-
year-old son THOMAS back into camp clutching a bleeding hand

GERRY
Be right back

He heads out to --
EXT CAMPGROUND - CONTINUOUS
-- as Stan sets Thomas down by the door to their camper

GERRY
What happened

STAN
Little accident setting a rabbit trap
(to thomas)
Sit here Ill try to find something
to wrap that up with

GERRY
I may have something Just a sec

Gerry ducks back inside as Stan examines the cut

THOMAS
Shouldnt we do this inside Its
cold out here

STAN
Coldll slow the bleeding Besides
we dont want blood in the camper
Sooner or later were gonna leave
here and I dont want any of those
things smelling blood as we go by

World War Z 72207 13

THOMAS
Theyll all be gone by then

STAN
I wouldnt count on it

Gerry approaches with a pressure bandage hands it to Stan

GERRY
Here you go this should help

STAN

Thanks

(as he works)
We got everything we needed when we
headed out except medical supplies
Every drug store and pharmacy we came
across was empty Between the looters
and the Zs wasnt much left So I
appreciate this

GERRY
Not a problem

STAN
I can give you something in trade

GERRY
Maybe later
(to thomas)
So whered you learn to make a rabbit
trap

THOMAS

Theres a guy over in the next town
Garcia Mendez came over from Puerto
Rico Used to be a gardener Now he
teaches all the guys he used to work
for -- all these CEOs and big deal
millionaires -- how to catch food
cure meat that sort of thing Its
a long walk but I can introduce you

GERRY
Thatd be great thanks

They turn as a CAR with a camper shell arrives in the
campground It glides toward an open spot a few hundred yards
away Stan shakes his head as the car settles in

STAN
Another one for the welcome committee
You want to handle this one while I
take care of Tom

GERRY
Sure thing

World War Z 72207 14

STAN
Dont know what good that shells
gonna do em out here when the real
snows come Id bet good money they
dont have more than a few days worth
of supplies in there Theyll start
coming around for food real soon

(beat softer)

You sure you got enough ammo for the
long haul Gerry

GERRY
Im good

STAN

Those things out there are bad enough
Having to watch out for our own kind
thats hard Cant blame ‘em I guess
The schools teach you everything except
how to survive Kids come out knowing
all about every kind of software but
how to look for water Rotate crops
What part of a tree you can eat and
what11 kill you

(rubs it in)
How to build a rabbit trap

THOMAS
Dad can we just --

Suddenly we HEAR the SOUND of iron pipes hitting metalan
alarm from somewhere in the camp Gerry grabs a shotgun from
the RV as Stan pulls a revolver out of his coat

STAN
It came from back that way

They start running other refugees folding in alongside as
they run But they dont get very far when they see --

-- a lone zombie that has stumbled through the line of trees
its skin blackened from frostbite covered in snow Its
nearly frozen solid icicles hanging from its mouth and eyes

Two other campers are already there hitting it with baseball
bats as it snarls ineffectually Theyre enjoying this

FIRST CAMPER
Yeah Come on Get some

SECOND CAMPER
Not fast enough Come on Hey
asshole Remember Philly

They hit it The thing swings back weakly Gerry and Stan
look on with disgust

World War Z 72207 15

Then one of the campers gets too close and trips on the icy
ground The zombie springs toward the camper only to be SHOT
cleanly in the head by Stan It falls to the ground inert

STAN
What the hell do you think this is
some kind of fucking game

FIRST CAMPER
We were just --

STAN
Put it in the hole with the others
Go on We dont want the smell
bringing in more of those things

The first camper looks as though hed like to argue the point
but swallows it back Yanks up his friend as if this was all
his fault and they start toward the inert zombie

Gerry looks to the RV where Rachel is visible in the window
Shes seen all of this He tries to wave reassuringly She
doesnt even register him

As he starts with Stan we notice other refugees cutting down
trees for the bonfires that burn nearby Stan nods at them

STAN
See that They should be pruning the
branches not cutting down trees
Wont have any left pretty soon
Just like I was saying Dont know
the first thing about long term
planning You live your whole life
never being more than two miles away
from a McDonalds who needs to worry
about how to live when the supplies
run out

With that he goes to attend to his son calling back

STAN
Just got to hold on Gerry do what
we got to dofor as long as it takes

Gerry watches him go then glances to the car that brought in
the new arrivals Theyre still running the engine warming
their hands on the heat from the vents They wave to Gerry
He nods distantly then starts toward them as we go to a

HELICOPTER SHOT

Pulling UP until were high above the campground moving faster
and higher until we can see abandoned freeways littered with
broken cars covered by snow A nation on ice

BLACK SCREEN

Holding for just a moment UNDER the words
TWO YEARS LATER

Before coming in hard on --

DISSOLVE TO
EXT STREET OUTSIDE GERRYS APARTMENT - DAY

Once this was a sleepy bedroom community Now the buildings
have been burned out or boarded up Debris and signs of
looting are everywhere Feral dogs and cats move freely down
the street as slowly --

-- we notice a few people here and there some stepping down
off military buses on foot or on bicycles They look around
with shell-shocked haunted eyes barely recognizing this
place All of them carry holstered handguns rifles or
shotguns with the kind of familiarity that says theyve been
carrying these weapons for a long time Its not a statement
its a life-style

Among them we FIND Gerry Karin Constance and Rachel They
look thinner pale exhausted down to their souls Theyve
come through hell itself to the other side and theyre still
not sure the nightmare is entirely over Gerry nods to an
equally shell-shocked neighbor but the man doesnt respond
doesnt acknowledge anything but whats in front of him

INT GERRYS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

PULL BACK as Gerry Karin and the rest ENTER the apartment
and keep pulling back to find torn curtains and furniture

garbage everywhere Graffiti has been spray-painted on the
walls most prominent among them the words Remember Philly

Like a man in a trance Gerry walks to the window for the
first time getting a real birds eyes view of --

-- the city below which looks vastly different than when we
first looked out of this twelfth-story window offices and
apartment buildings have been burned down or blown apart by
artillery shells Stores have been looted Below people
sift through the rubble of their homes no working cars for
as far as the eye can seeand in the distance pyres of
bodies being burned

What was once a fashionable neighborhood now looks like
something out of Iraq or the aftermath of Katrina

We end on Gerrys haunted eyes as he takes all this in
World War Z 72207 17
INT GERRYS APARTMENT - NIGHT

Gerry Karin and the kids are all asleep together on the living
room floor a single candle guttering in the darknessuntil
six-year-old Constance opens her eyes and looks to --

-- the door where shadows from the candle dance and flicker
CUT back and forth between the doorher facethe gap
beneath the doorback to Constance until finally --

-- she carefully extricates herself from Karins arms and
goes to a nearby duffel bag She pulls out a door jamb and
shoves it in beneath the door wedging it closed Only then
does she go back to the others to try and sleep

EXT WATER ALLOCATION CENTER - DAY

Gerry and several hundred others are carrying large plastic
bottles lined up to get water from an army supply truck As
the workers go about their efforts Gerry looks off to --

-- a row of brownstone apartments which have been vandalized
and spray-painted with graffiti including Remember Philly

Some of the buildings also have official looking markings
spray-painted on their doors The markings on one door reads
2 DNZ 1 ZD another reads 0 DNZ 4 ZD 2 Some doors dont
have any markings Gerry nudges the man next to him in line

GERRY
Whatre those

The man glances in the direction Gerrys pointing

MAN IN LINE
The wars over but like every war
there are always some who get caught
behind the lines The Zs are no
differentsome of em got locked in
cellars or attics by relatives Others
dont have legs to walk out on but
the rest of em works just fine

He points to the markings

MAN IN LINE
The marks are left behind by the sweep
and clear teams 1 DNZ means one
dead non-zombie 1 ZD means one zombie
destroyed This way the burn teams
know what theyre walking into

GERRY
And the doors without markings

World War Z 72207 18

MAN IN LINE
Means theyve been padlocked but the
teams havent made their final checks
Usually theyre empty but like
everything in life you never really
know for sure whats on the other
side of the door until you knock eh

GERRY
So whatre the question marks for

MAN IN LINE
Some folks couldnt handle the stress
of the war and went crazy started
acting like zombies kind of like
that Stockholm Syndrome but way out
of control Some of em are so far
gone you cant tell whos what until
you get close The SandC teams take
‘em out just to be safe Suits me
fine When in doubt shoot em in
the head and run like hell

Gerry nods but something in his eyes is very worried by this
as he moves up to accept his ration of water

INT GERRYS APARTMENT - DAY

Gerry is painting over the graffiti He comes to the Remember
Philly spray-painted on the wall He hesitates as though
it would be disrespectful to cover it upthen does so

EXT WATER ALLOCATION LOT - DAY

Another day another line Gerry is standing in line with
everybody else when he sees a sweep and clear team come roaring
up to an apartment buildings with unmarked doors They pile
out take up position at the door and RUSH inside For a
moment silence

Then the sound of GUNFIRE comes from inside When they
emerge they spray-paint 2 ZD on the door then move off

The line hardly notices

EXT GERRYS APARTMENT - DAY

Gerry is dumping debris into the piles that line the street
when he sees a car coming in his direction Aside from the
supply trucks this is the first working car weve seen since
his return It slows and stops at the curb in front of him

The door opens and ROBERT MCENROE emerges British patrician
old school practical 50s He looks to Gerry Smiles

MCENROE
Hello Gerry

World War Z 72207 19

Gerry looks at him from behind eyes that have lost the world
that was It takes a moment to focus on him then

GERRY
McEnroe

He reaches to McEnroe as if to confirm that hes real

GERRY
Sonofabitch You made it through

And the two embrace

MCENROE
Yes

GERRY
How

MCENROE

Last chopper out to the Montana green
zone They needed somebody from the
UN to help coordinate the war efforts
overseas and everyone else --

(beat)
-- well everyone else was either
dead or missing in action

Its an uncomfortable subject McEnroe looks to the debris
being put out on the street

MCENROE
I see youre heavily into cleanup
GERRY
Its going to be a long process thats
for sure
MCENROE

Which brings me to the reason Im
here other than to see you alive and
well of course When the army said
it was going to start moving civilians
back into cleared areas I had the
sweep and clear teams look for your
name on the refugee lists So when I
heard you were back --

(beat)
I have a job for you Gerry if you
want it

Gerry reacts to a job as if the words came from another
time and place

GERRY
A what

World War Z 72207 20

MCENROE

Well youre doing such a good job on
cleanup here I thought you might
like to try it on a somewhat wider
scale

(a smile)
Its a long story and I dont want to
keep you Ill send a car tomorrow
at nine to get you That all right

GERRY
Isure I mean yeah I guess

MCENROE
Then Ill see you in the morning

He gets back into the car and drives off Gerry watches it
go with something close to astonishment before heading inside

EXT UNITED NATIONS BUILDING - MORNING

The area around the UN building is nearly deserted as a car
pulls up and deposits Gerry out front Bits of paper swirl
in the empty street as he looks around and enters

INT UNITED NATIONS BUILDING - HALLWAY -- DAY

Gerry walks with McEnroe past workers cleaning up debris and
replacing broken windows

MCENROE
Bit of a mess eh The good news is
we should have the electricity back
on in a few days Not for long just
a couple of hours a day to start but
itll be a big help Im pretty sure
your place is in the coverage grid

GERRY

Can I tell Karin Shell be relieved
MCENROE

Of course So how did you do it
GERRY

Do what
MCENROE

Survive Some of us were lucky enough
to be chosen for the green zones or
quick enough to make it to the red
zones but others were caught outside
andwell they had a much harder
time of it So what did you do to --

GERRY
We did what was necessary

World War Z 72207 21

He says it hard cutting off both the discussion and the
emotion behind it McEnroe lets it go

They pass a suite of debris-filled offices identified by a
sign as UNITED NATIONS INVESTIGATIVE SERVICES Gerry looks
at the names on the door seeing his own there His fingers
graze some of the other names

GERRY
Theresa Camafelodid she --

MCENROE
No She didnt make it

GERRY
Rudy Rose Big John

MCENROE
Everyone in your division is either
dead missing or out of it Youre
the only one left that I can count
on Thats why I wanted to see you

McEnroe moves on his mood somber Gerry takes one last look
at the suite then follows into --

INT MCENROES OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
-- where McEnroe and Gerry sit across from each other

MCENROE
Millions of people died in the war
Gerry Once the final figures are
in the number may be in the tens of
millions People want answers They
want to know why those in charge didnt
connect the dots why it happened
what went wrong and whos to blame
Since the UN is in the best position
to make that determination weve
been given the job of investigating
the question and filing a report
Now Im giving that job to youif
you want it

GERRY
A report on the war I wouldnt know
where to start Its too big

MCENROE
Approach it like a systems analysis
Why and how did the emergency
infrastructures here and abroad fail
to respond to the threat posed by the
infection

World War Z 72207 22

GERRY
And everyones going along with this
The US China all the other countries
theyre okay with me asking questions
about why they dropped the ball

MCENROE
I wont lie to you Everyone wants
you to find whos responsible as long
as its not them Theyll cooperate
but only to a point So if you take
the job youre going to spend a lot
of time looking over your shoulder

McEnroe goes to the window looking at the ruins of New York

MCENROE
Youll start domestically -- weve
set up meetings for you in San Diego
Chicago a few other places -- then

move on from there Weve secured
permission for you to travel to China
Israel Germany anyplace you like
Its the first time anyones been
authorized for that kind of travel
since the restrictions were put in
place to contain the infection Youll
see the worldwhats left of it

GERRY
And I can interview anyone I want

MCENROE
Within reason To expedite things
each country has given us a list of
people they think we should talk to

GERRY
Meaning theres probably an even bigger
list of people I shouldnt talk to

MCENROE
And none of them will be very happy
to see you Its a thankless job
But its yours if you want it

GERRY
Its justa job this big could take
Months Karin and I and the kids
weve just started putting our lives
together again How can I justify
taking that kind of time away from
them now

MCENROE

Because now you can Because youre
the best person for the job

MCENROE
Not true I know you Youre like a
dog with a bone once you start you
dont stop until you get to the end
I need that determination I need
you

He approaches Gerry his tone quiet reflective

MCENROE
The wars over Gerry Weve survived
Now its time for someone to tell the
world why so many of us had to die in
it To make sense of it all If you
can think of anything more important
than thatlet me know

McEnroe lets the question hang between them

The apartment is lit by candles kerosene lamps and crank-

of dinner Karin is cleaning up alone and in silencethat
kind of awkward painful post-argument silence punctuated by
dishes clattering too loudly in the sink a moment later
Gerry comes into the kitchen Looks to Karin She doesnt
look back He finally breaks the silence

GERRY
I tucked Rachel in Constance was
asleep before her head hit the pillow
(no response)
McEnroe says the power should be back
on in this part of town any time now

Dishes clatter She doesnt acknowledge the information

GERRY
Ive decided to take the job

The clattering stops The argument starts

about it

GERRY

KARIN
Iocan I can do that just fine

He studies her eyes knowing what shes talking about Goes
to hold her She backs away He doesnt push it

GERRY

I could give you all the logical
arguments about how we could use the
money about how this will give us
some structure for the first time in
a long while but the truth is --

(beat)
I need to understand why we went
through all this why it happened I
need for the world to make sense again

KARIN
Theres no sense to make Gerry It
just happened like an earthquake or
a tsunami I want to move on with my
life not spend it looking back Who
did this who did that who cares

She studies his eyes and sees that his decision remains

KARIN
Didnt even make a dent did I

She turns away as he reaches for her

KARIN

GERRY
Six months Maybe more

She nods businesslike formal Cold

KARIN

You have to understand that word was

We hadnt been briefed on what to do

She gets to row 14 where a man in a dark suit is sitting
slouched his seat head down The passenger beside him on

foul smell She leans over the other passenger toward 14E

She reaches toward the seat as suddenly the man in 14E LUNGES
at her with a strangled cry his mouth an angry slash

She JUMPS back as he twists in his seat tangled in the seat
belt He turns on the passenger beside him and TEARS at his
throat blood gushing everywhere killing him instantly

CHARLENE
I locked myself in the aft bathroom

GERRY
And the pilots

CHARLENE
They followed emergency procedures
meaning they were not to open the
cockpit door no matter until the plane
was on the ground and in the control
of local authorities

GERRY
How did they know Passengers were
being attacked

CHARLENE
The screaming

GERRY
No one got on the intercom to tell
them what was happening or who was
doing the attacking

CHARLENE
There wasnt time

GERRY
So other than the fact that Passengers
were being attacked the pilots had
no idea what was happening As far
as they knew it could have been
terrorists or hijackers or --

CHARLENE
Yes

GERRY
But you knew

CHARLENE
Yes

GERRY

And you didnt make any attempt to
warn the pilots about the cargo they
were now carrying

with those things in the wayI never
wouldve gotten close to it

Gerry checks his notes the silence in the room

GERRY
The pilot didnt survive the war but
in his testimony before the FAA he
said that if hed known the passengers
had become infected he would have
followed recent issued emergency
instructions and ditched the plane at
sea rather than unleash five hundred
cases of infection inside the Us

CHARLENE
The pilots were told about that policy
but that information was never conveyed
to me or the rest of the flight staff

GERRY
So the knowledge that the Plane would
have to be destroyed with everyone on
board had no bearing on your failure
to tell the pilots what was happening

INT AIRPLANE

As passengers and crew battle the infected we find Charlene
standing between the bathroom and the intercom which is within

she makes a conscious decision not to do so She runs into

the trip can take six or seven days
changing cars hiding out in the day
to avoid the federales

Halfway here theyd flip Now the

a flashlight in at them then moves to the back of the car

He looks at the trunk of the dusty car Doesnt see anything

to REVEAL four or five tiny holes He leans down LISTENS

that interviews can be conducted more

priest who has the power to reanimate
the body and teach it to walk back to
its village for burial

EXT ANOTHER SHACK -- MOMENTS LATER

A villager stands guard outside the padlocked shack As the
woman and Tsai approach she nods to him and he unlocks the
door After glancing inside to make sure its okay he opens
the door the rest of the way Tsai precedes the woman into --

INT ANOTHER SHACK -- CONTINUOUS
——— LN IENUOUS

-- and the stench is even worse here A single bare bulb
hangs from the ceiling swinging slightly as we reveal --

-- what was once a young man now shackled to a post bound
and gagged his complexion gray eyes rolling and unfocused
But when it sees Tsai it locks on with frightening intensity

Tsai moves slowly toward the young man who is pulling at his
shackles focused on Tsai and nothing else still wearing
his gloves Tsai begins an examination The young mans head
rolls and lolls his mouth snapping and closing on the gag
Tsai reaches for the young mans wrist to take his pulse

DR TSAI
No pulsehe has no pulse
Impossible

He digs in his bag for a stethoscope Puts it to the mans
chest No heartbeat He reaches for the bag again

DR TSAI
What happened to him

WOMAN
Three days ago he was swimming in the
lake where some other men had
disappeared He said that something
under the water bit him

He injects a needle to draw blood Pulls back on the syringe
After a long moment a thick dark brown fluid enters the
syringe like blood that has nearly coagulated Tsai is still
trying to come to grips with this when -

-- the young man lunges at him pulling the gag free Tsai
scuttles back across the floor as the infected man yanks at
the chain that restrains him

Suddenly theres the SNAP of a shoulder separating and the

manacled arm is RIPPED FROM ITS SOCKET No blood drips from
the wound only a brown thick sludge

As it LUNGES for Tsai again the woman cries out hysterically
and yanks Tsai out the door to --

-- where the guard SLAPS the padlock on again From inside
we hear the thing scratching and Clawing trying to get out
As Tsai tries to process what he has just seen we HEAR

except that it was virulent and
contagious and beyond anything Id
been trained to handle

EXT NEW DACHANG -- MOMENTS LATER

Tsai is on a cell phone pacing

DR TSAI (V0O)
So I called the Ministry of Health to
report my findings The voice at the
other end was hard official routine
in a way that made me think that I
was not the first to make such a eall

VOICE ON PHONE
Those who are already infected should
be restrained If any have passed
into coma vacate the room and secure
the exit

DR TSAI
Its already been done Look were
going to need a full medical team

I knew then that something was wrong
More wrong than I had suspected So

As the woman looks on Tsai passes the cell phone over each
of the wounded villagers sending back photos

DR TSAI (V0)
When I told him what I had seen he
asked me to show him those who had
been infected

Finished he puts the cell phone back to his ear

DR TSAI
So what do you think Gu

KUEI (on phone)
Have you had any direct skin-to-skin
contact with the infected

DR TSAI
No

KUEI (on phone)
And youve already called it in

DR TSAI
Yes of course The medical team
should be arriving at any time and --

KUEI (on phone)
There are no doctors coming Do you

He starts walking forward and we COME AROUND to REVEAL that
the village has been burned to the ground and everyone killed
whether infected or not

rumors the government would find
counter-productive If I told anyone

what might have been changed had I
but found my voice and my courage
for just one moment

GERRY
So why are you telling me now Isnt
there still an element of risk

Tsai looks out the window to the pyres in the distance

DR TSAI
Of course Terrible risk For both
of us But one must ask in the world
that exists now in all of thatwhat
is risk

GERRY
Dr Tsai plagues like Ebola stay
contained because the disease is fe)
aggressive that victims die before
they can get very far So how did an
infection as aggressive as this one
spread from an isolated Part of China
into Europe

DR TSAI
Before the War China exported many
things Toy trains Vegetables
Cat food We were also the number
one provider for illegal organ
transplants to the rest of the world

would come for an organ from someone
with a rare blood type and soon there
would appear that exact organ from a

Those who harvested the organs at the

money not the bulletins warning about
people found with strange bite wounds

The surgeon reluctantly takes the scalpel and slides it in

the smell of burning bodies At night
I would go into a garden behind my

was to return I learned that our
government had decided that the only
way to stop the infection was to
cauterize the wound

I was told that no one must know
that the fate of the country depended
on it But I knew she would call

Stan his son and several OTHERS get ready to head out each

earlier fighting with a frozen incapacitated zombie

Gerry waves encouragingly to Rachel She waves back but

STAN
Brand new Welded these babies myself
The lobotomizer Lobo for short
Taking out a zombie with bullets wastes
ammunition because the damned things
dont stand still This is made for
close-up work You can crush its
skull with the shovel or one ax head
then yank it back to take out another
one with the other ax forehand and
backhand like tennis Two for the
price of one efficiency in production

borders a nearby town From the amount of snow on them theyve

been walking for some time As they come to a clearing they
see --

a zombie lightly covered in snow standing in the middle
of the road It sees them Based on their prior experience
with a frozen zombie the two CAMPERS dont show much fear

FIRST CAMPER
Yo check it outanother corpse-

It snarls as they approach

Dont play with it just put it down
So we can get on with --

Then Gerry sees that somethings wrong --

Too late Moving fast the zombie rips out the throat of the
first camper Dripping blood and tissue it turns toward the
second camper as Stan comes on the run lobo in hand

STAN
Out of the way

Stan SINKS the lobo into its head putting it down hard He
no sooner yanks the ax head clear than his attention is drawn
by a low snarl Three more zombies emerge from the woods

STAN

Thomas quickly hands out the lobos as the zombies ATTACK

The battle is brutal and bloodygunfire and lobos cutting a
swath through the zombies who are fierce but out-numbered

Finally they stand over the dispatched zombies exhausted
STAN
I dont get itthese things should
be frozen solid

He carefully puts a hand on one of the now-inert zombies

STAN
Its hardly cold at all

Thomas points to a thin line of smoke that rises from the

other side of the hill They start toward the smoke but

and killed He looks to Gerry

what is not until you read the reports

After the plague spread beyond China
travel restrictions were put in place
to slow its spread to other countries
But there were persistent rumors about
ships smuggling refugees from infected
countries to uninfected ones Several
of these boats were said to be
registered to German citizens --

INFORMATION MINISTER
Not true We launched a thorough
investigation into this very question
and no German was ever found guilty
of smuggling infected people into
other countries Now Im afraid we
really must go Good day to you
Herr Lane and good hunting

They stand and head out of the room shaking hands with Gerry
as they pass The last one to file past is the lone female
member of the council She looks up at him and we can see
that shes visibly upset by this With the others already

goods not people The people that
brought the goods with them were not

did not want anyone saying Germany
was responsible for spreading this

The travel restrictions were put in
place so countries could control the
infection by better controlling their
borders Didnt it bother you that
you were carrying people who mightve
been infected

Helf leans in pissed and making a point

HELF
No it did not bother me and I tell
you why There are rules on my boat
and rule number one is we do not
take chances Its not good business
My father said the man who runs into
a burning house is not a hero he is
a fool because the fire does not
know what courage is and does not
care So yes when the borders close
I take people on my boat But I check
every one of them If there are marks
I say no No marks I say yes

things and their governments could
do nothing to stop them They could

them up It was a feeding frenzy
For usand for them

EXT PORT OF ALONG -- NIGHT
Ee NIGHT

Dozens of ships of every size choke the seaport Sideboats
have been beached to pick up passengers The shoreline rises
to a hill crowded with thousands of refugees crying out
holding aloft passports and money bargaining for a Place a
seat a chance a hope

Fights break out between the desperate and the determined
People wade into the sea climbing onto boats already loaded
to capacity only to be beaten back by men with clubs and guns
Crew members in side-boats wave flashlights shouting out
their prices

World War Z 72207 65

CREW 1
Give me your money everything you
have then Ill take you

CREW 2
Women only Here Women only

CREW 3
What have you got Ill take food
Food and money

Crew member 4 Indian himself shines a light in the face of
an Indian woman then shoves her back

CREW 4
Too darklight skinned only no
untouchables no lower castes

We FIND Helfs ship parked offshore where a handful of
refugees are being led aboard from a sideboat

SHIPS SECOND
Thats the last of them

HELF
You checked them for wounds
(he nods)
Then we go

The ships second hurries off as Helf goes to the wheel and
kicks the engine into high gear The boat cuts through the
night when suddenly in the distance we hear GUNSHOTS

He looks to the shore as we HEAR a SOUND that no one could
ever forget ten thousand terrified people SCREAMING at once

HELF
-mMerciful god

ON THE SHORE

Thousands of zombies crest the hill swarming down onto the
stranded refugees What was chaos turns into blind panic
Armed men fire but the undead tide keeps coming

People dive into the sea swamping sideboats as crews kick
them away fighting to get to open water

A big ship cabled to a smaller one beached on-shore is pulled
sideways as more people climb in The cable SNAPS spilling
refugees into the sea as --

7 More zombies plunge into the water The sea foams with

people swimming toward the boats which are themselves caught
in the maze of ships crowding the port fighting to get away

World War Z 72207 66

One boat accidentally rams another capsizing both of them
Screams fill the night air as passengers and crew fight for
their lives in the sea of teeth

Helf is torn by what he sees the horror the desperate screams
of men and women struggling against the death that prowls
below snatching up at them and pulling them down

In agony he turns the boat around heading for the refugees

HELF
Stand by the ropes Hurry

SHIPS SECOND
Captain --

HELF
Do it

The ships second runs off to comply as Helf drives the ship
right into the midst of the horror

HELF
(half to himself)
The fire does not recognize courage
Lets hope the sea does
(beat )
Stupidstupid

But he does it anyway And within moments the swimmers nearest
his boat reach for ropes and hands Many of them are grabbed
by zombies beneath the water and yanked down with a scream

A zombie starts to pull itself up the anchor line A crew
member FIRES blowing it back into the sea The deck is
crowded the boat full Helf shouts to his second

HELF
Thats all we can carryget us out
of here

The second complies as Helf sees a young woman still in the
sea clutching her infant child fighting to stay above the
water She SCREAMS for help His reaction is immediate

He JUMPS down to the lowest rung of the side-ladder reaching
for her as she struggles with sea and child --

HELF
Here Over here

--as suddenly a Zombie BREAKS surface jaws SNAPPING for
Helfs flesh barely missing as Helf grabs the woman

HELF
Hang on

World War Z 72207 67

He yanks her up as the engines kick in and they fall onto the
deck The boat DARTS forward speeding through the maze of
bigger ships He views the carnage through eyes numb with
horror

A container ship on fire GUNSHOTS ringing out
Another ship sinking as zombies bob all around feeding
Finally Helf turns to his second looks to their Passengers

HELF
Are any of them infected

SHIPS SECOND
Were almost done checking but so
far --

CREW MEMBER
Sir

The crew member backs away from the woman and infant Helf
just pulled out of the water He pulls off a blanket to reveal
the infant has blood on it

WOMAN
No Shes not infected The bloods
from someone in the boat Here look

She frantically washes the childs arm and in a moment its
clear that the blood is only on the surface The ships second
checks the infant its okay Helf nods to the woman

HELF
What about her

CREW MEMBER
I checked herno wounds

They relax as the woman pulls the blanket around her and moves
off with her child But as she walks away we TILT down to
her bare feet to find she is leaving a slight footprint of
blood from a bite on the bottom of her heel

EXT HELFS BOAT -- NIGHT
— eet a NIGHT

The ship glides through the open sea far from the madness of
Alang Helf walks past the refugees who sleep exhausted
on the deck He lights a cigarette his hands shaking

He takes a breath of fresh air allows himself the comforting
knowledge that he has escaped unscathedwhen he hears a
wet tearing sound coming from the aft end of the boat

He follows it cautiously until he sees the woman he rescued

earlier sitting on the deck facing away form us still
covered by the blanket The sound is coming from here

World War Z 72207 68

Helf shines a flashlight on hercomes around to the front
and discovers to his horror that she has turned The thing
that was once a young woman looks up at him absently as she
quietly devours her infant child

Helfs eyes go wide with the light of madness as he reaches
for his gun pulls it out and FIRES

INT MOABIT PRISON - INTERVIEW ROOM -- CONTINUOUS

The gunshot ECHOES in our ears as Helf continues

Sometimes since then I think perhaps
my father was right I dont know

Helf discovers wetness running down his face Brushes at it
with his palm Over the SILENCE that follows we HEAR

So Frank Dexter gave you my name to
talk to
EXT BERLIN - WATERFRONT -- DAY
RE RONT DAY

Gerry is walking along the waterfront with a CIA agent named
WILL CAFFERTY

GERRY
You sound surprised

WILL
Halfway through the war I got dumped
into an overseas desk job Im
surprised anybody still remembers to
pay me

(beat)

Still Dex is a good guy He always
did right by me even when nobody
else wanted to know I was even alive

GERRY
Why What happened

WILL
Lets just say that what I know makes
me a bitinconvenient to some people

GERRY
Dex said your job before the war was
monitoring communications between
various countries and their embassies

WILL
Thats correct Diplomatic messages
are always encoded before being sent
(MORE)

He stops

World War Z 72207

WILL (CONTD)
Of course we had the codes We had
their codes they had our codesit
was a game

GERRY
So were you monitoring communiqués to
and from China when the plague first
appeared
(Will nods)
When did the CIA first know there was
a problem in China

WILL
Depends on how you define know From
the intercepts we knew something was
going on The problem was we were
too smart for our own good We didnt
know that we knew

looks out at the water Darkens

WILL
When all this started it was so
unbelievable So when we unscrambled
the codes we assumed that we were
looking at a second code wrapped inside
the main code Walking dead as
code for compromised agents suicide
bombers the capitalist system actors
from 70s sitcoms whose best years
had passed how were we supposed to
know that when they were talking about
the walking dead they were talking

about the walking dead Nobody speaks
that plainly unless --

GERRY
-- somethings seriously wrong and
theres no time for misunderstandings

WILL
Right But we didnt know that We
couldnt know that But try to explain
that to the American people After
the whole Bin Laden Determined To
Attack United States fiasco can you
imagine how theyd react to the idea
that we looked at message after message
saying there were freaking zombies on
the move and still couldnt connect
the dots

GERRY
So why were the Israelis able to figure
out what was going on

World War Z 72207 70

WILL
I dont know but if you find out
tell me because Id love to know

Will starts walking again cutting off any further inquiry

GERRY
Itd be a big help if I could put you
on the record include your name
your position --

WILL
Not a chance

GERRY
Then why tell me all this

Will stops starts to answer Looks off Then

WILL

Because Dex is a good friend and I
owe him And because somebody should
know the truth I just dont want my
name on it thats all

(beat)
I better go Ive had one of my guys
distracting whoevers been tailing
you but --

GERRY
Im being followed

WILL
Twenty-fourseven Whatd you expect
Even as far in the dog house as I am
Ive heard enough to know that a lot
of people are worried about this report
of yours Word is youve gone off
the reservation talking to all kinds
of people you shouldnt be talking
to Me included

(beat)

Look you want my advice Take what
youve got write your report and
walk away Because like we learned
during the war you should stay off
the road unless you know for sure
whats waiting for you at the other
end And brotheryou have no idea

emphasize his isolation small against the world

Exhausted wary Gerry sits in the Berlin airport There are

a few other travelers but still nowhere near what youd
expect Sitting nearby is a young girl with a snow globe
portraying a quaint German village covered in snow She smiles
at Gerry He smiles back But his attention is drawn to --

- the snow globe flakes of white whirling around in the
water which brings us to --

EXT CAMPGROUND - FLASHBACK -- NIGHT
SR EBACK -- NIGHT

The snows have fallen more heavily now thick drifts engulfing
many of the campers Trees have been cut down all over the
place Gerry walks through the camp his heavy coat pulled
close around him against the bitter cold carrying a
rudimentary snow-fishing rig

He pauses beside the car with the camper-shell that arrived

in a prior scene now covered in snow He brushes aside the
Snow to see the young couple insidefrozen to death huddled
against one another in their last moments

Gerry turns from the sight and continues toward the RV UNDER

You couldnt catch anything

INT RV-- MOMENTS LATER

Karin sits on the edge of Rachels bed Rachel is fevered
ill half conscious Gerry paces in the main Part of the RV
angry at himself Their two-year-old is crying in BG

I dug a dozen holes in the ice
nothing The fish have all gone deep

KARIN
Or theyve already been fished out

GERRY
Theres another lake a couple miles
farther down the road Il leave
tonight so I can be there when the

Not good A hundred and two We
need to get some solid food in her
shes not strong enough to fight the

GERRY
I know I know

He goes to Constance who is crying

Is Rachel gonna die

GERRY
No honey Rachels not going to die
Shes just real sick But shell get
better Youll see

He glances to Karin whose eyes show great doubt
EXT CAMPGROUND -- LATER

In the pre-dawn hours Gerry exits the RV equipped for any
fish or game he might come upon As he starts away he glances
to the shell-covered car noticing that the Passenger door is
slightly askew as though someone opened it but couldnt quite
get it closed again

Not knowing what this might forebode he moves to the car
Brushes away the new snow Looks inside

The body of the frozen young woman is gone He glances around
finding tracks in the snow where something was dragged

His gaze follows the drag-tracks to Stans camper We continue
to FOLLOW his gaze as he looks upand sees a thin trail of
smoke rising from the campers stove

Gerry closes his eyes refusing to acknowledge the horror of
what he knows has happenedand continues off as we HEAR

PA VOICE (V0)

- as Gerry is pulled out of his reverie He looks to the
girl with the snow globe picks up his bags and tousles her
hair as he heads tiredly for the gate

The problem with most people is that
they dont believe something can happen
until it already has

INT WARMBRUMM HOME - KITCHEN -- EVENING
—Cooo EN - - EVENING

JURGEN WARMBRUMM 50s avuncular is cooking dinner and talking
to Gerry as kids run in and out grabbing nibbles from plates

World War Z 72207

WARMBRUMM
Thats not stupidity or weakness
thats just human nature Tf just
happened to be born into a group of
people who live in constant fear of
extinction It has taught us through
horrific trial and error to always be
on our guard

He looks to where a kid is edging toward a piece of dessert

The kid takes a powder

Warmbrumm

WARMBRUMM
If you eat that dessert before dinner
you will not get another dessert for
six months Your choice

WARMBRUMM
That is what we do in the intelligence
service We provide our politicians
with information and the illusion of
choice when we have already decided
what needs to be done That is one
of the differences between our
countries In America you fix the
intelligence around the policy We
fix the policy around the intelligence
In Israeli politics intelligence
comes first In us politics
intelligence is much harder to find

keeps cooking as Gerry approaches

GERRY
So how did you do it Every other
intelligence service intercepting
communiqués between China and her
embassies had the same information
But you were the first to figure out
what was going on How

WARMBRUMM
In the months before October 1973
Israeli intelligence saw footage of
Arab troop movements but unanimously
agreed that they did not pose a threat
to us A month later the Arab attack
almost drove us into the sea So we
made a little change If nine of us
look at the same information and come
to the same exact conclusion it is
the responsibility of the tenth man
to disagree No matter how improbable
it may seem the tenth man has to
start digging on the assumption that
the other nine might be wrong

Warmbrumm looks to Gerry smiles
World War Z 72207 74

GERRY
And you were the tenth man

WARMBRUMM

Precisely Since everyone assumed
that this talk of zombies was cover
for something else I began my
investigation on the assumption that
when the Chinese said zombies they
meant zombies that human beings were
being reanimated as ravenous killing
Machines And slowly enough pieces
began to come together to Say that
yes this was true this was
happening and it was a threat not
just to us but to the whole world

(beat)
So I wrote up my report and sent it
upstream

INT MOSSAD HEADQUARTERS - OFFICE - FLASHBACK -- DAY

The office of the Israeli Secret Intelligence Service in Tel
Aviv At one end of a long conference table sits Warmbrumn

uncomfortably as a government OFFICIAL -- the head of Mossad --
sits at the other end of the table reading Warmbrumms report

The room is silent except for the rustle of Pages The section
chief doesnt want to be here and he keeps glancing to
Warmbrumm with a why are you doing this to me expression

To break the painful silence Warmbrumm points to the report
WARMBRUMM
I attached some high altitude

reconnaissance photos but they dont
really show

He tapers off at a lethal glance from his section chief
Finally the official finishes reading Re-stacks the Pages
Taps them so theyre properly lined up Places them in the
folder closes it Places his hands flat on the folder as he
looks out across the table for another silent BEAT then

OFFICIAL
Zombies

The section chief shifts uncomfortably seeing his career
passing in front of his eyes

SECTION CHIEF
Minister I --

The official silences him with a gesture Looks to Warmbrumm

World War Z 72207 75

WARMBRUMM
The intercepts are very clear about
the aggressive nature of the infection
Whether it is spread only by contact
or if it is airborne is unknown but
the process is always the same The
infected person dies --

SECTION CHIEF
Or seems to die It could be similar
to catalepsy creating a condition
that looks like death but --

WARMBRUMM

The infected person dies The
infection then reanimates the corpse
at the most primitive aggressive
level It attacks it feeds and
continues to do so until destroyed by
a bullet to the brain or decapitation

(beat)
Ive spoken to several neurologists
who say there could be a bacteria
that produces a biochemical bath that
preserves the neural system even in
death Because only the instincts
necessary for survival are revived --
violence and the need to feed -- its
possible that the infection can only
reanimate the most primitive parts of
the brain

OFFICIAL
And your solution to this is a wall

WARMBRUMM
In conjunction with heightened security
checks to isolate anyone who exhibits
signs of sickness or disorientation
anyone with visible wounds especially
bite marks We already have secure
fences along the West Bank the Gaza
Strip and elsewhere We can start
there and secure the rest in short
order

OFFICIAL
Your report mentions Jerusalen

WARMBRUMM
Its too wide-open too exposed there
is no way we could secure it
(soberly)
We would have to abandon Jerusalem

This goes down hard Warmbrumm leans in his tone urgent

World War Z 72207 76

WARMBRUMM
The infection spreads with frightening
speed One becomes two becomes four
becomes eight and suddenly you are
outnumbered They do not respond to
threats They do not tire do not
register fear do not notice pain or
injury or loss of limb If they are
allowed to gain even the smallest
foothold in Israel it will be too
late for all of us

The section chief risks a glance to the official who is
tapping his fingers on the report Finally

OFFICIAL

On my way here I reviewed your
personnel file Ten years with the
Mossad and no disciplinary problems
no drinking problems Your last review
described you as efficient but not
terribly imaginative It pronounced
you sane sober and competent three
words that I wish were not at the
other end of this report

(beat)
You realize that if this report is
incorrect if any part of it is in
error you will be fired in a manner
so breathtaking in its rebuke that no
intelligence service on the planet
would hire you That your career
would be over That for all intents
and purposes you would be the walking
dead Do you truly understand that

WARMBRUMM
I understand

OFFICIAL
(sighs)
I was afraid you did

He takes the folder puts it in his briefcase and stands

OFFICIAL
I will convene a meeting with the
Prime Minister at three oclock
Meanwhile I Suggest you send a copy
of this to our American friends
Perhaps they can add something of
their own

And he starts out of the room UNDER

have no idea

A hand takes the envelope puts it on a cart and --

-- in an EXTREME HIGH SPEED sequence the cart rolls down the
hall turns to a delivery room its shoved into a clear
plastic box BLASTS out the building into a truck then into
an airplane cargo hold it goes dark --

-- back to LIGHT as the box is offloaded onto another truck
it speeds across town then the envelope is removed and --

-- placed on another cart ZOOMING down the halls of the CIA
until it arrives at a desk where the envelope is dropped into
the IN BOX on a CIA agents desk He picks it up flips
through it then picks up the phone Dials an extension

WARMBRUMM (CONTD)
Not to illuminate the mistakes those
are inevitable Corruption
foolishness short-sightedness yes
they must be pointed out and punished
But more than that we must bring
with us out of this war one singular
truth the truth my people learned in

situation no matter how high that
black implacable wall of death we
are facing might be we find a way to
get past it We climb over it we go
around it we tunnel under itwe
hope our way out and we think our way
out We did not just shoot our way
out of this mess Mr Lane We thought
our way out of it

I dont knowI certainly didnt see
much thought leading up to the war

both of those offenses

RADEKER
In the eighties I worked with the
Apartheid government in Pretoria
South Africa It was a difficult
time On the black side you had the
ANC and the Inkatha Freedom Party
and on the white side were right wing
Afrikaners who wanted a racial showdown
to prove once and for all who was in
charge We were surrounded by enemies
and corrupt governments The country
was resting on a bed of nails

He gets up pours a drink

RADEKER
As director of emergency planning I
was asked to develop a strategy by
which a white minority population
might survive even win against a
larger more violent majority A
doomsday scenario if you wishthe
ultimate survival strategy for the
Afrikaner people

He returns sits heavily the years weighing on him

RADEKER
The key was to accept the premise
that you cannot save everyone Imagine
a boat at sea being overwhelmed by
people struggling to get aboard If
you try to save them all you will
sink the ship and doom everyone

World War Z 72207 82

RADEKER (CONTD)
You must decide who can be saved and
who must be sacrificed In the event

most wish to save and into green zones
areas protected by mountains rivers
or other natural defiles where the
infected cannot reach These
individuals would be chosen by age
IQ party affiliation whatever would
make them valuable assets in a new

to pretend that the selections are
random but in fact that must be very
deliberate

That is phase two You pull as many
people as you can out of the suburbs
and into the major citiesas bait

Theres shouting from within the ranks of the shadowed figures

This will allow you to efficiently

be one less zombie throwing itself
against the defenses of those you
most wish to protect

VOICE IN SHADOWS
This is insanity --

RADEKER

Of course you cannot tell the people
in these red zones that they are bait
because they will attempt to flee

So you will have to present it in
such a way that they will believe
they are your first priority instead
of what they actually are expendable

silent as he approaches Radeker who isnt sure what to do

Rolihlahla goes to him studies his face with sad eyes whose
gaze seems to go to a place deep within Radekers soul He
lowers his gaze as the elder statesman puts a hand on his
shoulder Turns to the rest of those who sit in darkness

ROLIHLAHLA

the luxury of tears Gerry is at a loss for words

Mr Radeker I

RADEKER
Its all right I was there and
even I still do not have the words
(beat)
Its time for you to go

He gets up as a masked figure brings the hood over Hands it
to Radeker who holds it as he stands before Gerry

GERRY
One last question This meeting you
describewhen did it take place

RADEKER
August I remember because it was
very warm that summer

Radeker studies Gerrys eyes as Rolihlahla studied his own

RADEKER

I do not know how much longer I will
be allowed to live Mr Lane My
continued existence is a threat to
certain people Before that happens
I was hoping someone might come here
one day so they might know the truth
To let the world know that I was not
the man they said I wasand that
perhaps in the end I was the man I
thought I was

(trails off)
My report showed a way mankind could
survive Let us hope that your report
and the years that follow demonstrate
a reason why mankind should survive

pilots and airmen boisterous and cocky

As Gerry carries off his tray he pauses at a bulletin board
filled with mementos insignia from different states and Air
Force divisions photos letters from homeand in the midst
of it a sign that reads Remember Philly Gerry glances at
it then heads to a table near a group of pilots heavy on
adrenaline beer and bravado

PILOT
-- and Parkers got me on this approach
vector heading right toward a mountain
and Im like guys Im gonna crash
here Then I saw em over a hundred
Zs inside a wash running beside the
mountain So I just fucking unloaded
on em with everything I had Hellfire
missiles 50 cals and they had nowhere
to go there was arms and legs and
brains flyin all over the place it
was a thing of beauty

SECOND PILOT
Biggest nest weve found yet sweep
and clear teams never even saw it
Jack here even got down on foot just
so he could hit some of the Zs with
a pie in the face

This draws Gerrys attention and he interrupts with

The chopper is flying above some very rocky and isolated
terrain Gerry wearing a radio headset looks down at the

as the pilot calls back to Gerry

rear of the chopper as Gerry stretches his legs

GERRY

note that reads JIM -- WILL PAY you BACK LATER -- BOBBY

He continues into the garage where some tools remain on the
work bench He picks through them looking for a pipe wrench
Doesnt see what he needs Goes to one of two tall storage
cabinets As he approaches one we notice that the door to
the second storage cabinet starts to OPEN behind him As it
CREAKS Gerry spins around at the sound and --

- a CAT emerges from the cabinet sees him and takes off
Gerry smiles relieved as he opens the first cabinet --

-- and a badly decomposed zombie in the overalls of a gas
station attendant LURCHES OUT of the cabinet with a snarl

Gerry tumbles over the counter as it lunges at him its body
so decomposed that muscles and tendons hang in tatters

As Gerry scrambles to his feet and plunges back through the
office we HEAR TWO GUNSHOTS from outside He runs out to --

-- only to find that while the chopper is still sitting on
the lot the pilot and co-pilot are gone raising ominous
possibilities about the gunshots heard a moment earlier
The zombie roars out of the gas station coming after him

Gerry runs to the chopper but the doors are locked He turns
to see more zombies heading his way from the woods

‘GERRY
-ogod

He takes off running for all hes worth
The zombies pursue

Gerry crashes through the trees breathing hard terrified
trying to put distance between himself and his pursuers

We catch glimpses of the zombies in pursuit hear snarls and
the crash of feet against underbrush

Gerry zigs one way then another trying to lose them when he
comes into a CLEARINGand stops his eyes wide in horror

Dozens of zombies lay on the ground covering the clearing
They lay side by side like beetles blackened by sun bloated
and distorted by rain and the elements They could be mistaken
for dead bodies piled into a mass grave until --

-- Gerry INHALES in CLOSE-UP
One of the zombies hearing a living breath opens its eyes

They all open their eyes Snapping awake like trap-door
spiders attentions sprung by the arrival of prey

Gerry starts running again his face a mask of terror

He runs stumbles picks himself up keeps going The zombies
close the gap swarming at him from all sides No way out

Then theres the RUSH of wind and the ROAR of rotors as the
helicopter appears overhead A rope-ladder is thrown out and
hangs suspended in front of him the space too narrow for a
landing

Gerry sprints for the ladder as the zombies close in grabbing
his clothes snapping at him jaws closing on air GUNSHOTS
from above using PIE explosive bullets take out several of
them but the rest keep coming

With one final LEAP Gerry snares the rope ladder hanging on
as the chopper SOARS up into the air

Arms folded tight against his chest for warmth he rocks slowly
back and forth for a Moment then slowsstops Looks off

A few hundred yards away a lone deer nearly starved tries
to find bits of grass beneath the snow It hasnt seen him

Hands trembling from the cold Gerry reaches for the shotgun
but in the instant before he can grab it the deer SEES him
and LEAPS toward the protective woods as --

Gerry GRABS the shotgun and FIRES wild missing it He
starts running feet pistoning snow pursuing the deer through
the woods running and falling and running He FIRES again --

and grieving he SLAMS a fist into the cold ground as if
trying to wound the already wounded earth He hits it again

matching belt from the other side

He slides one clasp into another Click Then another

With the familiarity of habit and long practice he belts her
into the bed He fastens another one across the lower part

The soldiers look nervously to each other
through eye-pieces networked to helmet camer
and-white video giving the scene a stark realism

Fire

We SEE the carnage
asgrainy black-
and horror

ANOTHER SOLDIER

Artillery cannons and chain-guns on tanks and Humvees BLAST
out at the approaching tide shredding the first rows and

World War Z 72207 104

blowing up more buildings The zombies eyes never leave the
soldiers in the distanceintense intent determined

Hundreds of cannon artillery and mortar rounds are fired
The road is transformed into a vision of hell fire smoke
explosionsasolid wall of absolute destruction

Casey is hunkered down with his men as the firestorm continues

GENERAL CASEY (V0)
It was a fucking meat grinder a wood
chipper we werent even blowing them
to bits anymore they were evaporating
into the air blown into clouds of
blood and organic material

The firestorm seems to go on forever a roar loud as the end
of the world that grows and growsand finally stops

The smoke swirls and parts The streets and buildings are
covered in blood and body parts Hundreds maybe even a
thousand bodies totally vaporized by the attack

The next thousand keep coming And the thousand after that
The tanks humvees and artillery FIRE but in smaller numbers

GENERAL CASEY (V0)
Then it happened

The soldiers look to the big vehicles some of which have
stopped firing

GENERAL CASEY (V0)
The big guns the tanks and humvees
and Comanchesstarted running out
of ammo

SOLDIER
What the fuck

BACK WITH CASEY
In the present as he stalks the room

GENERAL CASEY
They gave us all these toysyoud
think one of those freaking West Point
jerkoffs wouldve made sure we had
enough shit to shoot wouldnt you

The Bradleys only carried a handful
of ground-to-ground rockets the kind
that did us the most good The rest
of their racks could only handle ground-

BACK To SCENE
As a tank FIRES a silver object that STREAKS Past CAMERA

GENERAL CASEY (vQ)
You know what an armor-piercing
depleted-uranium dart does to horde
of walking zombies

FOLLOW the dart as it penetrates qa hundred zombies crashing
through chests and legs and stomachs and hearts until it
comes out the Other end embedding itself into a wall

The zombies who were holed by the dart keep coming heedlegs
of the gaping wounds in their bodies

GENERAL CASEY (V0)
Absolutely nothing

The zombies are now uncomfortably Close to the first line of
Soldiers too Close now for heavy munitions fire Fingers
tighten on triggers as the word comes

i ANOTHER SOLDIER
Open fire Fire at will

The soldiers OPEN FIRE on the zombies who gain speed and
momentum now that they are within feeding range Some are
Struck in the head and fall but the rest keep coming walking
right over the bodies of those who were destroyed

Soldiers get to their feet from behind Sandbags firing

SOLDIER
Die motherfuckers Die

In an instant the zombies are all over them The defense

line breaks transforming into a series of desperate fights
Zombies swarm through their ranks Blood and screams Gunfire
and snarls Soldiers Struggle hand to hand

We SEE the battle magnified a hundred times over in the
Soldiers helmet Cameras one after another going to STATIC

as they are pulled down and killed

A Humvee Swarmed by zombies GUNS the engine in reverse
trying to get the hell out of there and SLAMS into a tank
the accident cutting off escape for Other vehicles

An armored Personnel carrier also Swarmed BLASTS away with

its chaingun Striking another vehicle that EXPLODES Pouring
molten metal and med across the bridge

Zombies ablaze in burning fuel take down soldiers trying to
retreat as more vehicles burst into flame

Its a scene of utter absolute Carnage an inferno a rout

In this we FIND General Casey fighting for his life
Surrounded by zombies FIRING for all hes worth

GENERAL CASEY
