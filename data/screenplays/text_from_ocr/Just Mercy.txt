EXT ESTATE (ALABAMA) - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE JUNE 7 1987

3 SHOTS -- LOOKING UP AT a grove of pine trees leaves
and limbs swaying in the breeze backdropped by the
Alabama sky

A lead weight tied to the end of a cord FLOATS into the
air wraps around a high limb

REVEAL WALTER “JOHNNY D” McMILLIAN (40s black) as he
PULLS on the cord to lift the rope up to the top of the
tree

CLOSEUP ON THE ROPE

as he expertly ties a bowline knot and PULLS it up to the
treetop

He hands the excess rope to his EMPLOYEE (30s black)

WALTER
Let’s lay it down right here

He looks up at the tree once more respectfully Then --

CLOSEUP - A CHAINSAW

cuts a notch into the side he wants the tree to fall
Then he SAWS through from the other side

The tree falls CRASHING to the ground
Walter CLICKS off his saw and looks up taking a moment
to watch the trees dance in the wind He takes a DEEP
BREATH -- at peace Then looks over to his employee --
WALTER

Alright let’s chop and load

hops off the back looks at his employee

WALTER

As his employee starts the truck Walter looks at the
house to see MR ABNEY (50s white) cooking something on
a BBQ

WALTER
Okay Mr Abney Gimme a call if
you need anything else cleared

Mr Abney gives him a nod nothing more But Walter
doesn’t let this damper his mood

He notices something up ahead slows to a stop to see --
SEVEN POLICE CARS block the road with 14 OFFICERS guns

drawn and aimed at him He TURNS down the MUSIC Fear

ripples through him as --

SHERIFF TATE (late 30s white) approaches the truck
unsettling ease in his step

Walter shows both hands as Tate reaches the window
WALTER
Afternoon sir need to see my

license

SHERIFF TATE
Oh no that won’t be necessary

Tate seems almost friendly as he looks at the trailer of
logs then over the truck brand new rims on the wheels

SHERIFF TATE

expensive

Walter locks eyes with him -- how does he know his name
He looks out the windshield to see 3 OFFICERS approaching
with guns aimed at his head Tate leans in close

SHERIFF TATE

reason to do this right now

Framed through the Plexiglas of a metal door BRYAN
STEVENSON (early-20s) eyes that never stop thinking
stands nervously in an old suit as a GUARD opens the
door

He hesitates before entering the 20-foot room stools
bolted to the floor metal mesh for walls It’s obvious
he’s not used to being in a place like this As the door
SLAMS behind --

INT GEORGIA STATE PRISON - VISITATION ROOM - DAY (TWENTY
MINUTES LATER)

Bryan sits staring at a used notebook WHISPERING his
introduction to himself preparing for what’s ahead

Then -- chains CLANGING from outside the door the
HAUNTING SOUND increases with his anxiety until --

CLANK The door opens and a GUARD walks in with the
prisoner HENRY DAVIS He looks about Bryan’s age
black and just as worried as he is As Bryan looks at
him he averts his gaze

As the Guard UNLOCKS his chains Bryan notices how
weighed down Henry is -- handcuffs on his wrists chain
around his waist shackles on his ankles

Taking off the last shackle the Guard looks up at Bryan

GUARD
You got one hour

The door CLANGS shut behind the Guard Bryan takes a
BREATH

The Southern Prisoners Defense
Committee sent me to tell you that
they don’t have a lawyer for you
yet but they hope to soon

HENRY

You not a lawyer

BRYAN
Uh no I’m still in school I’m
just interning here for the

summer
Henry doesn’t hide his disappointment

HENRY
So you can’t tell me nothin’
about my case

BRYAN
Oh um I am supposed to tell you
that you’re not at risk of
execution any time in the next
year

Henry stares Bryan can’t read his expression Henry
puts his head down lets out a long EXHALE speaks
without looking up --

HENRY
Can you say that again

BRYAN
(hesitant)
Youre not at risk of execution
any time in the next year

Henry takes a BREATH slowly nods to himself When he
finally looks up he has tears in his eyes as he holds
his hand out

HENRY
Best news I’ve heard in a long
time

Bryan grips his hand surprised as he’s pulled in for a
hug

HENRY
Didn’t want my wife and the kids
showin’ up if I had an execution
date comin’ Now they can come
visit
(sincere)
Thank you

Bryan nods more at ease Henry looks at him curiously

HENRY

years that ain’t a inmate or a

surprise)
How old are you

Honestly this internship has been
my best experience so far

experience You need to get out

Bryan and Henry share a playful smile as Henry grows
somber

HENRY
Your mama must be real proud
(looks off)
That’s the hardest part knowin’
all the shit I put her through

Before Bryan can respond -- CLANK The Guard opens the
door angry He strides up to Henry roughly CUFFS his
wrists behind his back

GUARD

You should have been done two
hours ago

I’m sorry sir it was my fault
I didn’t realize the time

GUARD
You’re supposed to watch the
clock

Henry WINCES in pain as the Guard SQUEEZES his cuffs and
YANKS him to a standing position Bryan stands more
distressed by this than Henry seems to be

BRYAN
Hey Stop that He didn’t do
anything

GUARD

You need to shut your mouth

HENRY
(off Bryan’s shock)
It’s okay Bryan

Don’t worry ‘bout me Just come
back

The officer tries to push him out but Henry plants his
feet leans back strong and dignified He closes his
eyes and begins to SING his baritone voice strong and
clear

HENRY
I’m pressing on the upward way
New heights I’m gaining every
day --

The Guard stops pushing for a moment thrown off by the
song

HENRY
Still praying as I’m onward
boundLord plant my feet on
higher ground

him The Guard resumes shoving Henry down the hall but
he doesn’t stop SINGING his voice ECHOING with his

EXT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL - DAY (ESTABLISHING) AAY

INT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY AQ

FIND Bryan one of FOUR STUDENTS OF COLOR in a class of
30 BETSY BARTHOLET (40s white) leads the seminar

PROFESSOR BARTHOLET
In the 1972 Furman v Georgia
decision the Supreme Court
strikes down the death penalty
because of widespread racial bias
Four years later the Court
upholds a new death penalty scheme
in Gregg unwilling to presume
racial discrimination without
evidence This year Warren
McCleskey’s lawyers presented
evidence that the new death
penalty is as racially biased as
the old one But they lose Why

A LAW STUDENT (20s white) entitled doesn’t raise his
hand --

LAW STUDENT
McCleskey didn’t get the death
penalty because he was black he
got it because he killed a cop in
cold blood

Bryan exchanges a look with another BLACK STUDENT
they’re used to this clown Professor Bartholet can see
Bryan’s wheels turning

PROFESSOR BARTHOLET
Bryan Thoughts

Bryan would rather not engage but he can’t stop himself

AQ

JUST MERCY - FULL YELLOW 10

BRYAN
The Baldus study they presented
proved that in Georgia you’re 11
times more likely to get the death
penalty if the victim is white
than if the victim is black 22
times more likely if the defendant
is black and the victim is white
Every way you look at it race is
the greatest predictor of who gets
the death penalty

LAW STUDENT
The reliability of that study is
debatable

Bryan glances at the Law Student used to this type of
classmate over the years He doesn’t hold back --

BRYAN
Over 2000 murder cases subjected
to 230 nonracial variables It
was reliable enough for the
Supreme Court to accept

LAW STUDENT
But they still rejected the
argument

BRYAN
Because they were afraid of trying
to fix something they believed was
unfixable And they were wrong
(beat)

In his dissent Justice Brennan
ridiculed the ruling as ‘a fear of
too much justice’

LAW STUDENT
I think they’re just being
realistic A certain amount of
bias in our judicial system is
inevitable It’s just a hard
truth we have to learn to live
with

This triggers a fire in Bryan unseen before
BRYAN
Live with The whole point is
that some of us don’t have that

luxury

Bryan takes a beat All eyes on him now as --

AQ
JUST MERCY - FULL YELLOW 11
Ag BRYAN

I grew up in a racially segregated
community in Delaware where black
kids weren’t allowed to go to
public school But in Brown vs
Board of Education the court
didn’t say segregation was
inevitable they said it was
unconstitutional They forced the
country to open up the schools
and that’s the only reason I’m in
this classroom That’s what the
law can do when it’s used for
justice

(beat)
As long as the death penalty is
administered on the basis of race
or class it’s as big a stain on
our country as segregation or
slavery And I don’t think it’s
naive to believe we can do
something to change it

LAW STUDENT
Well five Justices of the Supreme
Court would disagree with you
there

Bryan stares at the Student more determined despite the

odds

BRYAN
Come on Mom

ALICE
You think this is funny If you
can’t see the danger in what
youre doing then you should ask
Harvard for your money back cause
you used to be smarter than that

Bryan chooses not to respond just looks at her with
care Alice looks away sits down on the porch steps
Bryan follows her lead sits beside her

ALICE
Howie told me you’re making
fourteen thousand dollars a year

BRYAN
What didn’t he tell you

ALICE
You could have taken any of those
job offers in DC and been set
for the rest of your life

BRYAN
You know that’s not what I want to
do

ALICE

I didn’t want to work two jobs my
whole life either but I did it
so my children could get ahead
not so they could go make half of
what I was making ten years ago

You taught me not to care about
money to do what my heart tells
me is right

am I supposed to do with that

The love between them is evident Bryan looks down
choosing his words carefully before speaking with care

row I never expected to meet
someone the same age as me who
grew up on the same music in a
neighborhood just like ours He
could have been any of the guys

I don’t want to move so far away
from you either But you taught
me to fight for the people who
need it most That’s why I’m
going down there I know I can
help them

ALICE

I’m very proud of you

(lets that sink in)
And I know your heart is in the
right place but it’s not that
simple What you’re doing is
going to make a lot of people
upset

Yes sir We was changing the

in the morning till we closed
after lunch He was right next to
me when them sirens was goin’ off

Why would Hooks lie

‘Cause the snitch cut a deal with
the cops They had ‘im locked up
for burglary and the day he gave
his statement they let ‘im out
all charges dropped

for perjury if alls I did was say

Then --

BRYAN
What they did is completely
illegal I’m going to talk to the
DA and get the charges
dismissed They won’t do this
again

DARNELL
How do you know You can’t
control these guys

Bryan silent realizing how true this is

DARNELL

They arrested me in the middle of
my shift in front of my boss I
don’t even know if I still got a
job tomorrow

(beat somber)
I feel bad for what they doin’ to
Johnny D but I’m just tryin’ to
survive man I can’t fight these
guys You gonna have to find
somebody else

BRYAN
Just give me some time to work
this out

Darnell sees an old TRUCK idling across the parking lot

DARNELL
That’s my ride Tell Johnny D
sorry

Before Bryan can respond Darnell gets out and rushes
off

Bryan sits He looks back at the county building anger
simmering A beat before -- he can’t help himself he
gets out of the car and marches back toward the jail

INT MONROE COUNTY JAIL - MOMENTS LATER

Bryan strides down the hall he passes a BLACK FAMILY in
tears a YOUNG WOMAN holding a BABY in one hand and
her SON with the other an OLD WOMAN praying with her
DAUGHTER 2 OFFICERS escorting 4 INMATES down the stairs

Bryan finds the door marked “Sheriffs Dept” and heads --

OFFICERS turn all eyes locked on him at once

Bryan spots Sheriff Tate staring at him across the room
He gathers his courage marches across the space toward
him --

When he’s almost there the man sitting across from Tate
turns around Bryan stops surprised to see Tommy
Chapman

TOMMY
Hey Bryan Have you met Sheriff
Tate

Bryan takes a moment to process Then controlled
anger --

BRYAN
Who ordered the arrest of my
witness

SHERIFF TATE
If people make false statements
concerning this case they’re
going to be held accountable

BRYAN
You can’t arrest someone for
perjury without evidence that a
false statement has been made

TOMMY
So you’re representing Mr
Houston now too

BRYAN
Yes I am His statement
contradicts Bill Hooks’ entire
testimony

TOMMY
Hooks isn’t the state’s main
witness Ralph Myers is

BRYAN
(frustrated)
Alabama code 12-21-222 requires
corroboration of accomplice
testimony so without Hooks the
conviction wouldn’t be valid

JUST MERCY - Rev 83118 (Green) 65

The two men stare each other down a beat before Tate
speaks his words cloaked in infuriating charm

SHERIFF TATE
You know I spoke to Ronda
Morrison’s mother yesterday She
was in tears askin’ me why some
lawyer from up north was makin’
them relive all this hell again

BRYAN
(remains calm)
You can tell her it’s because
McMillian didn’t kill her
daughter And whoever did is
still out there somewhere

SHERIFF TATE
(shakes his head)
I know how desperate you must be
to fulfill your fantasy of who we
are down here Just a bunch of
corrupt Southern racists framin’
niggers for murder And you here
to save the day If that’s the
story you wanna believe go right
ahead But I know Johnny D killed
that girl and he’s going to
answer for it

BRYAN
How do you know that You found
no hard evidence and based your
entire case on the word of an
indicted felon who had every
incentive to tell you what you
wanted to hear

SHERIFF TATE
Ralph Myers gave us his testimony
on his own accord

BRYAN
And it made no sense He couldn’t
finish a sentence without
contradicting himself

Silence The air sucked from the room Both men staring
at each other Bryan continues strong not backing
down

BRYAN
The charges against Darnell
Houston are baseless You know
they’1l never stand up in court

(MORE)

JUST MERCY - FULL YELLOW 66

BRYAN (CONTD)
They should be dropped
immediately

Tate stares at him a beat before smiling cordially

SHERIFF TATE
That alright with you Tommy

TOMMY
Sure
(off Bryan’s
surprise)
Doesn’t really matter now that
the court denied your motion to
reopen the case

Bryan stares at them both caught completely off guard

BRYAN
What are you talking about

TOMMY
You didn’t get the order The
judge is down in Mobile now
Sometimes they have mail issues

Bryan fights to regain his footing as Tommy stands

TOMMY
You can tell Mr Houston the
charges against him are being
dropped I can do that much for
y’all but anything else will have
to be raised on appeal

Tate gives him a condescending nod

SHERIFF TATE
Thanks for stoppin’ by Counselor

Bryan fights the urge to scream A beat he turns walks
to the door with confidence refusing to show any
intimidation

it but the car keeps inching closer

The car stops behind Bryan lights spinning

nonchalantly around the passenger side The YOUNGER
OFFICER approaches his door skittish and unsure

Something wrong Officer

YOUNGER OFFICER
Step out of the vehicle

Bryan can see the Officer’s nerves notices the Older
Officer shining a flashlight into his backseat filled
with files

BRYAN
I don’t understand I wasn’t
speeding

YOUNGER OFFICER
(ignores this)
I said step out of the vehicle

BRYAN
I will get out Officer But can
you tell me why I’ve been stopped
first

The Young Officer suddenly steps back and pulls his gun
points it directly at Bryan’s head as --

YOUNGER OFFICER
Get out of the goddamn car

A clear flash of surprise and fear in Bryan’s eyes can
see the Younger Officer’s shaking hands He fights for
calm raises his hands up narrating every movement as --

BRYAN

Okay I’ve got my hands up okay
I’m going to open the door now --

(opens the door)
I’m stepping out of the car

(as he steps out)
I’m standing up My hands are
empty

SHUT THE HELL UP

Bryan tenses the danger behind him ever present doesn’t
move as frozen in place as --

YOUNGER OFFICER
DON’T MOVE I SAID DON’T MOVE

BRYAN
I’m not

Bryan keeps an eye on the Younger Officer’s shaking gun
as the Older Officer tears through his stuff He
hesitates a beat then takes a BREATH his voice remains
steady --

BRYAN
Officer there’s no reason to
point your gun at me I am nota
threat to you You don’t need to
be scared

YOUNGER OFFICER
Shut your goddamn mouth

As Bryan freezes the Older Officer stands and stares at
him

OLDER OFFICER
You oughta be careful with your

words when you got a gun to your
head

He nods to the Younger Officer who lowers his gun
shaking with adrenaline Bryan finally BREATHES He
stares as the Officers walk back to their car a beat
before --

of my parents had two boys around

Walter thinks a long beat before answering

Well maybe you should think about
training up another lawyer or

need help if they take you out

Oh so this isn’t like a I go

Did they move you to death row
because you didn’t want to testify

break through But then Tommy speaks --

Bryan can see he’s not connecting He reaches into a bag
and pulls out a suit spreads it on the table

BRYAN
I don’t want you wearing a
jumpsuit this time
(off his look)
Regardless of what happens I want
them to know that we expect them
to send you home

Walter touches the fabric of the coat tries hard to
believe there might be hope but can’t get there He
shakes his head

WALTER
You ever think about dying

BRYAN
Why would you ask that

Walter looks off deep in thought Then --

WALTER
That’s all everybody in here talk
about What they gonna do before
they executed what they gonna eat
for their last meal who they
givin’ their stuff to I always
try to stay away from talk like

BRYAN

Evelyn points to a YOUNG GUARD (22 white) standing at
the door letting a short line of WHITE PEOPLE through

EVELYN
That boy’s makin’ us wait out here
for over an hour

Bryan quickly approaches the Guard boiling

BRYAN
What are you doing

YOUNG GUARD

Bryan knows exactly who gave that order He continues
firmly

BRYAN
This is a public hearing and these
people need to be let in right

matter anyway the last WHITE AUDIENCE MEMBER walks in

YOUNG GUARD

nerves then to Walter’s family and the men and women
standing in back He looks forward strong

JUST MERCY

- FULL YELLOW 136

BRYAN

It’s easy to see this case as one
man trying to prove his innocence
But when you put a black man on
death row for a year before his
trial and exclude black people
from serving on his jury When
you base your conviction on the
coerced testimony of a white felon
and ignore the testimonies of two
dozen law-abiding black
witnesses When any evidence
proving his innocence is
suppressed and anyone who tries
to tell the truth is threatened
this case becomes more than the
trial of a single defendant it
becomes a test of whether we’re
going to be governed by fear and
anger or by the rule of law

(beat)
If the people standing in the back
of this courtroom are all presumed
guilty when accused if they have
to live in fear of when this very
thing will happen to them if
were just going to accept a
system that treats you better if
youre rich and guilty than if
you’re poor and innocent then we
can’t claim to be just

Bryan takes a beat to look at Tommy They briefly lock
eyes

BRYAN

If we say we are committed to
equal justice under law to
protecting the rights of every
citizen regardless of wealth
race or status then we have to
end this nightmare for Walter
McMillian and his family The
charges against him have been
proved to be a false construction
of desperate people fueled by
bigotry and bias who ignored the
truth in exchange for easy
solutions That’s not the law
That’s not justice That’s not
right

(long beat)
This case should be dismissed
immediately Your Honor Thank
you

JUDGE BASCHAB

Tommy reluctantly stands unsure of what to say

TOMMY
I’m troubled Your Honor

The Judge glances at Bryan confused by Tommy’s
statement

JUDGE BASCHAB

TOMMY

People in this community want to
go to sleep at night knowin’ that

Jackie Eva hugs Brenda Tate shoots Tommy a
disappointed look as he walks out the door

Amidst the rejoicing MOVE IN CLOSE ON Walter as he
suddenly hides his face in his hands unable to control
the emotions inside of him Bryan leans in tries to

Eva who nods back -- she understands She waves to

They stop at the partition

Minnie looks to the Judge who nods for her to continue

She rushes to Walter her children close behind all of

about what I’d do if I got out

Walter watches all his friends cooking and laughing
Minnie waves for him to hurry up He waves back

WALTER
Those six years wasn’t all they
took from me They took a lot
more than that

Not sure how I’m gonna do this

Walter looks at Bryan full of gratitude as a smile

JUST MERCY

WALTER

But if pullin’ a innocent man from
his family and lockin’ him ina
cell for 6 years is what you call
workin’ we got a different
understandin’ of the word I
still can’t sleep past 3 AM
‘cause that’s when the guards woke
us up for breakfast Everywhere I
go I make sure somebody knows
where I am and what I’m doing
When I go to the store I make the
cashier sign my receipt so if
somebody tells me six months later
I was doing a murder on the other
side of town I can show ‘em proof
of where I was

(emotional beat)
I saw seven men killed while I was
in there Some of them was my
closest friends I know they
ain’t all innocent But they
still people And

Walter’s emotions overtake him thinking about Herbert
and Anthony and all those he left behind the pieces of

himself he

will never get back

Bryan pats his shoulder can see he can’t go on so he
for him Leans into the mic addressing the

takes over
Senators

BRYAN
This man has taught me a lot in
the time I’ve known him I came
out of law school with grand ideas
in my mind about how to change the
world But then I started working
with people who were wrongly
convicted children who were sent
to adult prisons where they were
raped and abused people with
mental and physical disabilities
who were thrown into cells when
they should be in hospitals
vulnerable people calling me every
day begging for help Sometimes
the problem seemed so big I felt
like a fool for thinking I could
do anything to fix it

(beat)

But working with Mr McMillian
made me realize that we can’t
change the world with only ideas
in our minds we also need
conviction in our hearts

(MORE)

JUST MERCY - FULL YELLOW 142

BRYAN (CONTD)

This man taught me how to stay

hopeful because I now know that

hopelessness is the enemy of

justice Hope allows us to push

forward even when the truth is

distorted by the people in power

It allows us to stand up when they
tell us to sit down and to speak
when they say be quiet
(beat)
Through this work I’ve learned
that each of us is more than the
worst thing we’ve ever done that
the opposite of poverty isn’t
wealth the opposite of poverty is
justice that the character of our
nation isn’t reflected in how we
treat the rich and privileged but
how we treat the poor the
disfavored and condemned

(beat)

Our system has taken more from
this innocent man than it has the
power to give back But I believe
if each of us can follow his lead
we can begin to change this world
for the better If we can look at
ourselves closely and honestly I
believe we will see that we all
need justice we all need mercy
and perhaps we all need some
measure of unmerited grace

Bryan sits back in his chair lets that sink in Walter
looks at him with playful disbelief The mic picks him
up as --
WALTER
I taught you all that
(off Bryan’s nod)
That’s pretty good
