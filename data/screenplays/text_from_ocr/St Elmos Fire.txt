fifty witnesses

WENDY
Life in the-fat lane

JULES

JULES
Unreachable somewhere in South

17 INT KEVIN AND KIRBOS APARTMENT - MIGHT (LATER) 17

Dirty laundry and Woody Allen posters Kevin sits in the
middle of the mess looking at photographs longingly He
wears camouflage shirts a black beret and shades --
drinks brandy and writhes in orgiastic ecstasy as he
sings along with JANIS JOPLIN

KEVIN

PIECE OF MY HEART NOW DARLIN’

Kirbo enters carrying his bike and Kevin immediately
hides the photographs in a straw basket and becomes his
sophisticated self

KEVIN
Quick whats the meaning of life

KIRBO
Dale Biberman
Kevin looks puzzled as Kirbo hangs up his bike

KIRBO
The girl I fell in love with when
we were freshmen Remember I met
her at that big fountain on main
campus The one that says
Knowledge Art Religion Life
she was sitting on the Life side
and she smiled at me

KEVIN
You took her to one movie Thats
not love its infatuation
Kirbo searches madly through records strewn on the floor

a€¢ KI RBO

Kevin there are several
quintessential moments in a mans
life losing his virginity
He yanks JANIS JOPLIN OFF abruptly

KIRBO
Getting married becoming a
father
KEVIN

Killing his roommate for removing
Janis Joplin for the soundtrack
from Manhattan

KIRBO
And having the right girl
smile at you She has the whitest
teeth Ive ever seen
RHAPSODY IN BLUE fills the room Kevin begins gathering
up his endless pieces of paper notes etc

KEVIN
If you think Im going to live
through another year of finding
poorly written unmailed love
scratchings around this apartment

KIRBO
I found her again Its fate
Its true love I have her
hospital schedule

KEVIN
Love is just an illusion created
by lawyer-types like yourself to
perpetuate another illusion called
marriage to create the reality of
divorce and the illusory need for
divorce lawyers Did you know
there are more people in law school
right now than there are lawyers on
the planet

KIRBO
Youre just bitter cause you
havent had sex for a long time

KEVIN
No wonder The sexual revolution
Who won

Finally having gathered up all his notes Kevin moves
toward the bedroom

KIRBO
Its the only illusion that counts

KEVIN
Says who

together with Leggo blocks You
design this

LESLIE

I did all the mechanicals for one

of our senior architects and I think

hes going to promote me to the

design staff

Kevin is fighting with a ridiculous wine opener

KEVIN
Maybe you could design a corkscrew
that actually works Everything in
this apartment comes from Scandinavia
They dont even have wine in
Scandinavia
Naturally Leslie opens it in a flash

KEVIN
Do you think my attachment to Alec
is unnatural

LESLIE
No I think mine is Weve only
just started to live together and
hes already pushing for the
wedding

Well since you fell in love with
a Democrat and now hes a
Republican I think all bets are
off

LESLIE
Thats what Im afraid of Did I
tell you that my perfect sister
and her perfect husband are getting
a perfect divorce-

KEVIN
I have the perfect cure Stay
away from love
He finds the butter and puts some on her hand

LESLIE
You must have been in love once
You like hot peppers

KEVIN
Doesnt Alec hate them

LESLIE
Insurrection Now come on Kevin
you must have been in love with
somebody sometime

KEVIN
Once in junior high I played
guitar in a group and fellin love
with our singer who did Weve Only
Just Begun as sweet as Karen
Carpenter I got high on cheap
champagne and pledged my love
Next day she ran off with the bass
player named Rocky and I traded my
guitar in for a battered Underwood
typewriter

to being one of the most important
writers in America

obituaries and very little else
Taking out shreds of papers and napkins

KEVIN
I cant seem to organize any of my
thoughts into anything of any
substance

LESLIE
Maybe you need to stop thinking so
much and fall in love again

KEVIN
Love stinks
The door opens and Alec arrives home

ALEC
Hi guys
He kisses Leslie

KEVIN
Rough day with the right wing
dear
Alec hands Leslie a red box She opens it excitedly and
finds a black lace nightgown She screams as Alec heads
for the kitchen

ALEC
Try it on
Leslie makes naughty eyes at Kevin and disappears into
the bedroom

ALEC
Leslie has to marry me soon

KEVIN
Why you pregnant Kidding
Whats your marriage hurry

ALEC
When you have a serious
relationship Kev youll find out
the problem with living together
its too easy

I ALEC

I mean its too easy to get out

of You either build to something
bigger -- like marriage -- or one
day you could make a mistake and
the person you were living with is
gone
Alec takes a bite of dinner and cringes

ALEC
Im going to kill myself

KEVIN
Theyre only peppers Alec

ALEC
I cant believe what I just did I
innocently go to buy the nightgown
and this amazing blonde salesgirl
starts coming on to me we wind up
doing it standing up in front of a
three-way mirror in the dressing
room
He lies down on the floor

ALEC
If Leslie would just marry me I
know I wouldnt do stuff like that
-- it would be a legal violation

KEVIN
As opposed to tonights standing
violation You think marriage is
going to make you faithful

ALEC
Yes

KEVIN
The idea of two people spending
their lives together was invented
by people who were lucky to make
it to thirty without being eaten
by dinosaurs Marriage is obsolete

ALEC
Dinosaurs are obsolete Marriage
is still around

Rejection Total and devastating
As long as she hasnt rejected me
theres hope

KEVIN
I have lived with a secret obsession
many years myself However I
realize the other person has no

interest in me -- so I pursue my
career which is going even more
unsuccessfully

KIRBO

Who are you in love with

KEVIN
I dont have to share everything
with you

(GRABBING LAUNDRY)
My underwear is enough Kirbo if
you must pursue this narcissistic
mortification that you have decided
to call love then you must ask her
out on a proper date Like a young
god Like Alec our leader would
KI RBO
Alec has balls He sees things
with his balls A balls-eye view
so to speak
Having taken their stuff out of the dryer they leave
