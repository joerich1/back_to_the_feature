MAYOR
Welcome citizens of Panem Welcome
to District 12’s reaping of the
74th annual Hunger Games As you
may know disaster struck what used
to be North America and what rose
from the ashes came the new land of
Panem Panem is the land we all
stand on now Panem was a shining
capitol ringed by thirteen
districts each contributing to one
type of work in the majority That
is until the Dark Days The
districts began rebelling against
the capitol which obviously
resulted into the unfortunate event
of a total civil war breaking out
And yet the capitol predictably
took the title of “winner” by
taking total destruction seriously
and erasing District 13’s
civilization forever Now the
Hunger Games was the result of this
happening and must go on In the
event of the uprising each of the
twelve districts must offer one boy
and one girl tribute to participate
in the Hunger Games and must
strictly be the ages of 12 through

(MORE)

MAYOR (contd)
18 The contestants will be put
into an outdoor arena where they
must survive all types of danger
and fight to the death or leave it
up to nature The last tribute
standing wins It is both a time
for repentance and a time for
thanks In the past 73 Hunger
Games we have had only a few
victors representing district
twelve A living victor
representing district twelve is
here today Welcome Haymitch

Katniss drinks it and looks very satisfied The two begin to
go through the enormous mound of food After a bit Katniss
leans back and begins to speak

KATNISS
(to Haymitch)
So you’re supposed to give us
advice

Haymitch drunkenly looks at her

HAYMITCH
Here’s some advice Stay alive

He burps Haymitch bursts out laughing Haymitch recovers
and swirls his cup of wine in his hand Peeta gets up

PEETA
That’s very funny

Peeta knocks the glass of wine out of Haymitch’s hand

PEETA
Just not to us

Pause as Haymitch takes this all in Haymitch stands up
walks towards Peeta slowly until they’re face to face then
proceeds to punch Peeta in the jaw knocking him to the
floor Effie flees the room Haymitch tries to reach back
for the bottle of clear alcohol but Katniss takes a knife
and stabs it in the table between Haymitch’s hand and the
bottle with a glare at Haymitch Haymitch smirks

HAYMITCH
Well well What is this Did I
actually get a pair of fighters
this year

Peeta rises and tries to get a handful of ice but Haymitch
stops him

( )

HAYMITCH
No no Let the bruise show The
audience will think that you’ve
mixed it up with another tribute
before we’ve even started

PEETA
That’s against the rules

HAYMITCH
Only if you get caught That bruise
will say you fought you weren’t
caught even better

Haymitch turns to Katniss Effie peeks into the room She
sees the knife lodged into the table She rushes to it

EFFIE
What is this That table was first
class That is mahogany

HAYMITCH
Can you hit anything with that
knife besides a table

EFFIE
Oh you just don’t understand

Effie stomps out of the room

Katniss ya
across the

Katniss an
Haymitch c

Beat

HAYMITCH
So can you

nks out the knife and throws it into the wall
room lodging into the seam of two panels

HAYMITCH
Stand over here Both of you

d Peeta walk to the middle of the room and
hecks them out

HAYMITCH
Well you’re not entirely hopeless
You both seem fit And once the
stylists get hold of you you’ll be
attractive enough

KATNISS
I don’t think I can trust you to
help me win Haymitch You’re
always drunk

( )

HAYMITCH
Alright I’1l make a deal with you
You don’t interfere with my
drinking and I’ll stay sober
enough to help you But you’ll have
to do exactly what I say

Beat

PEETA
Alright Fine

KATNISS
So help us When we get to the
arena what’s the best strategy at
the Cornucopia for someone-

Haymitch wags his index finger at Katniss

HAYMITCH
No no no no no One thing at a
time You’ll be put in the hands of
your stylists You’re not going to
like what they do to you but no
matter what it is don’t resist

KATNISS
But-

HAYMITCH
No buts Don’t resist

Haymitch takes the bottle of clear liquid and leaves the
room Katniss and Peeta exchange glances The train is
halting with a screeching sound They both run to the
window Many people dressed oddly are waving excitedly at
Katniss and Peeta They’ve arrived at the capitol Katniss
steps back but Peeta waves and smiles nicely at them until
the train station block their view Peeta turns and sees
Katniss behind him

KATNISS
What’re you trying to do

PEETA
Get sponsors Duh

Katniss looks at him as if he’s crazy
PEETA
Who knows One of them might be

rich

one thing we hate it’s whiners
Octavia grease her down

Octavia take a liquidy lotion and rubs it onto Katniss
Katniss scrunches her face in pain then relaxes Venia
turns to them with three tweezers in hand and gives one to
each of them

VENIA
If you find any stray hairs pluck
them
They examine Katniss together and pluck a few stray hairs
FLAVIUS

Perfect Oh my god what a peice of

office

VENIA
Good luck little charmer

Katniss closes the door behind her Katniss turns to see

CINNA standing with a warm smile

INT Cinna’s workroom Capitol Prep House- DAY

Cinna is a young man from the far side of the capitol He
wears normal clothing- a black shirt black pants The

only capitol
eyeliner and the slight accent

CINNA
Hello Katniss I’m your stylist
Cinna Is everything alright

KATNISS
Well yeah but you look so-

CINNA
Different Yeah I get that alot
That’s why I’m a designer I know
all the styles and how to work with
them Plus I don’t see what’s so
great about capitol fashion It’s a
little what’s the word

trace of him is the light metallic gold

( )

KATNISS
Overdone

CINNA
Oh yes Overdone Can you take off
that robe

KATNISS
Oh yeah sure

Katniss takes off the robe and Cinna takes it from her hands
and sets it aside Cinna circles her examining the work
that the prep eam had done on her nearly-naked body

CINNA
Who did your hair

KATNISS
My Mother

Cinna takes a closer look at the braid touching it here and

there

CINNA
It’s beautiful Classic really
And a nearly perfect balance with
your profile She has very clever
fingers

Cinna cotinues circling her to examine

KATNISS
Um Thank you You’re new aren’t
you I don’t think I’ve seen you
before

CINNA
Yes this is my first year in the
Games

KATNISS

So you were assigned District 12
He stops in front of her and hands her the robe

CINNA
No I asked for District 12 Why
don’t you put on your robe and
well have a chat

Katniss puts on the robe and follows Cinna to another room

DESPICABLE
INT Dining room Prep House- DAY

The room is simple and to the point It is small and encases
a dining room table with a huge red button on the bottom
corner and a few chairs surrounding the table Cinna pulls a
chair out for Katniss to sit on Katniss takes a seat and
Cinna takes his across from her side of the table He
presses thered button A loud buzzer sound escapes from
somewhere and a ton of people burst in and set up the food
putting a plate of food in front of both people and
utensils then rush out in a extremely small amount of time
Cinna acts as if nothing happened and begins to eat Katniss
hesitantly begins to eat Cinna stops eating Beat Katniss
looks up to see Cinna staring at her

CINNA
How despicable we must seem to you
No matter

Cinna takes a bite of his food

CINNA

So Katniss about your costume for
the opening ceremonies My partner
Portia is the stylist for your
fellow tribute Peeta And out
current thought is to dress you in
complementary costumes As you may
know it’s customary to reflect the
flavor of the district you come
from

KATNISS
So I’1l be in a coal miner outfit

CINNA
Not exactly You see Portia and I
think that coal miner thing is very
over done No one will remember you
in that And we both see it as our
job to take the District Twelve
Tributes unforgettable So rather
than focus on the coal mining
itself we’re going to focus on the
coal And what do you do with coal
We burn it You’re not afraid of
fire are you Katniss

SHOW OFF YOUR CHARIOT
INT Opening Ceremony buildings- NIGHT

Katniss wears a plain black unitard with a fire-resembling
cape and headbandtiara to match They are to be in flames
later Many designers bustle about adjusting the tributes’
makeup or congatulating eachother Peeta wears a matching
outfit Peeta walks up to Katniss

PEETA
Cinna told us to load into the
chariot

KATNISS

Where’s the chariot

Peeta points to a door They leave through it and walk to
their chariot in the far back of the line of chariots
Behind the door is a huge docking room where all the
tributes’ chariots are aligned in order Each chariot is
custom designed to resemble the district it’s for In front
of the docking room is a street in which the chariots will
ride through for the people to see In the streets you can
hear the people cheering for the tributes The show is
staring soon District 12’s chariot is plain black with
black horses Other tributes begin to mount their chariots
as well They sit on their chariot Beat

KATNISS
So what do you think of this get
up Cinna says he’s going to light
it right before we go on stage

PEETA
I’ll rip yours off if you rip mine

KATNISS
Deal Hey where’s Haymitch Isn’t
he supposed to be here

PEETA
With all the alcohol in him I
don’t think he was allowed near
open flames

Cinna gives them a thumbs up Their chariot ride off into
the street It’s loud with blaring music- not to mention
everyone’s extreme cheering that’d be loudenough with just
one of them It’s exravagant and very capitol-fashioned out
there Katniss and Peeta remain holding hands Katniss looks
around nervously She looks at Peeta noticing the fire
Katniss looks up at the big screen that has their faces on
it She smiles She blows kisses out to the audience
waving smiling and totally selling it The audience is
loving it They cheer out her name with a Peeta here and
there A red rose is thrown to her She catches it and
blows another kiss in the general direction of where it came
from They’ve almost reached the end of the road Katniss
giggles on last time then looks down at Peet’s hand She
pulls her hand away Peeta grabs it almost instantaneously

PEETA
No don’t Please Don’t let go of
me I might fall out of this thing

She nods holding his hand yet again Their chariot joins
everyone else at the boarding dock yet again The viewing
has ended Other tributes shoot dirty glances her way as
they leave Portia hurries to the tributes as they get out
of the chariot She extinguished the flames with some kind
of spray from a can Cinna walks by

CINNA
Great job you two I’m sure you’1ll
get many sponsors
He walks away PORTIA follows They’re still holding hands
PEETA
Um Katniss my hand is kinda
suffocating

She lets go

KATNISS
Sorry

PEETA
No I thank you I would’ve been
shaken to death by my own
nervousness without you there

KATNISS
It didn’t show I’m sure no one
noticed

PEETA

I’m sure they didn’t notice
anything but you You should wear
flames more often They suit you

Katniss raises her eyebrows and rolls her eyes She looks
away

KATNISS
(muttered)
Two can play at that game

She looks back to him and grins widely She speaks in an
overly grateful and sarcastic tone

KATNISS
Oh it’s nothing Thank you sooooo
much Peeta

Katniss takes a bread roll and begins to eat it

Come sit down
Katniss sits at the table

KATNISS
Where’s Peeta

EFFIE
Oh he’s just nervous He’s
sleeping Tomorrow’s training
tomorrow you know It’s where you
train to show the Gamemakers all
you’ve got It’s the best way to
get sponsors Your score determines
a big lot of your luck in these

games
KATNISS
Sounds like a big deal
EFFIE
Oh it is Trust me
Beat
KATNISS
How many sponsors do you think I’11
get
EFFIE

Well by my bet a lot
Unfortunately I’m not the one that
seals your sponsor deals Haymitch
is the only one that can

( )

KATNISS
So much for sponsors

EFFIE
Oh don’t be like that Haymitch

isn’t all that bad really He was

just like you before he won the

Hunger Games But don’t worry I’1l
hold him at gunpoint if I have to

I will make him seal every last
deal

Katniss smiles Katniss continues eating her roll

EFFIE

Where is my food I ordered it two minutes ago

An Avox girl walks in with her head hanging down

a plate of food

EFFIE
Ah there it is

She holds

The Avox girl hand Effie the food without making eye

contact Effie preps her food on the table

KATNISS
That looks delicious What is it-
Oh I know you

The Avox girl looks at Katniss in horror She shakes her
head and scurries away Katniss frowns Effie stops eating

She turns to Katniss

EFFIE
Don’t be ridiculous Katniss You
knowing an Avox The very thought
of it

KATNISS
What’s an Avox

EFFIE

Someone who commited a crime They

cut their tounges so they can’t

speak She’s probably a traitor of
some sort Not likely that you know

her And even if you did it’s
forbidden to talk to them unless
it’s to give an order Of course
you don’t really know her

( )

KATNISS
Well I guess not

Effie nods with a smile and continues eating

SUICIDE-PROOF

Peeta knocks the door She sits up

KATNISS
Come in

Peeta walks in He smiles at her She smiles back

KATNISS
Hey Peeta
PEETA
Hey Do you wanna join me on the

roof

She nods She gets up and follows him out the door

They walk onto the roof

KATNISS
Howd you find this place
PEETA
Cinna showed me It’s pretty
right
KATNISS
Yeah The wind’s a bit loud
though

tributes could escape or commit
suicide or be smart enough to
escape

Safe and sound

PEETA
You know what This is ridiculous
President Snow just doesn’t get it
He doesn’t get it at all We’re not
just pawns for their silly
televised fight to the death

KATNISS
I’m suprised anyone finds this
entertaining You sound alot like
my friend back home

PEETA
Well then your friend is smart I
just wish I could think of a way to
show the Capitol that we’re not
puppets That they don’t own me
That I’m more than just a piece of
their game

INT Elevator Training Center- DAY

Katniss Haymitch and Peeta all ride in an elevator
waiting for their floor

HAYMITCH
Today well negotiate what we need
to keep clear After I’11l send you
to train with the other tributes

The elevator opens They step into a room with a banner that
reads District 12

HAYMITCH
And otherwise I’1ll be coaching you
both seperately

KATNISS
What Why

HAYMITCH
Say you had a secret skill that
you’d like to keep secret

PEETA
But I have no secret skill Plus I
already know Katniss’ I’ve eaten

enough traded squirrels right

KATNISS
You can coach us together

HAYMITCH
Alright So give me an idea of what
you can do

PEETA
I can’t do anything special unless
you count baking bread

HAYMITCH
Sorry I don’t Katniss I already
know you’re handy with a knife

KATNISS
Not really But I can hunt With a
bow and arrows

HAYMITCH
And you’re good

( )
43

PEETA
She’s excellent My fatehr buys her
squirrels all the time She always
hits them in the exact same spot
the eye It’s the same with the
rabbits she sells the butcher She
can even bring down a deer Easy

KATNISS
(whispered)
What are you doing

PEETA
(whispered)
What are you doing If he’s going
to help you he has to know what
youre capable of Don’t underrate
yourself

KATNISS
(whispered)
Well what about you I’ve seen you
in the market You can lift flour
bags three times your weight Tell
him that That’s not nothing

PEETA
(whispered)
Yes because there’1ll be flour for
me to chuck at people in the arena

KATNISS
He can wrestle He came in second
last year in our school
competition His brother took first
place

PEETA
What use is that How many times
have you seen someone wrestle
someone to death

KATNISS
There’s always hand-to-hand combat
All you need is to come up with a
knife and you’1ll at least stand a
chance If I get jumped I’m dead

PEETA
But you won’t You’1ll be living up
in some tree eating raw squirrels
and picking off people with arrows
You know what my mother said to me

realized she didn’t mean me she
meant you

one She is She

KATNISS
But only because someone helped
me

PEETA
They’1l be tripping over each other
to sponsor you

KATNISS
No more than you

PEETA
She has no idea of the effect she
can have

HAYMITCH
Well well well Katniss there’s
guarantee there’1ll be bows and
arrows in the arena but during
your private session with the
Gamemakers show them what you can
do Until then steer clear of
archery Are you any good at
trapping

KATNISS
I know a few basic snares

HAYMITCH
That may be significant in the
terms of food And Peeta she’s
right Never underestimate strength
in the arena Very often physical
strength tilts the advantage to a
player In the main room of
training center they will have
weights but don’t reveal how much
you can lift in front of the

knot Save showing off for the
private session with the
Gamemakers Are we clear

Katniss and Peeta nod

eachother’s side at all times

Katniss and Peeta AD LIB But I don’t-
Haymitch slams his hand on a table

HAYMITCH
It is not open for discussion You
promised you would do whatever I
said You two are to stay at each
other’s side and remain amiable to

stations You must train at
whatever station you and your
partner pick Each station has a
specific skill to train for You

And after that incredibly long
speech this is where we let you
train

Trainer 2 points at the camouflage station

PEETA
Thanks

TRAINER 2
No problem kiddo

He joins Katniss who was waiting for him They begin to
walk towards the camouflage station

KATNISS
What was that Why’d you pick
camouflage

PEETA
It never hurts to learn new things
Plus this is the only thing
related to baking Icing is mud
It’s just the Hunger Games version
of baking

KATNISS
Uh okay

They reach the station Peeta sits down and tries it out
Katniss attempts to keep focus on it but can’t help looking
back Rue is watching them sneakily

PEETA
I think her name is Rue

Katniss bites her lip

KATNISS
What can we do about it I don’t
want her here in the Games Not
because of competition but because
she’s just so young She shouldn’t
be exposed to things like this

PEETA
What can we do At this rate
nothing We can only train Or help
her train

Katniss takes one last look at her

Peeta leaves the waiting room She watches him walk off

KATNISS
You can do this

Katniss walks into the room that Peeta came out of- the
Gamemakers judging room Most of the gamemakers are paying
no attention The stations are set up the same exact way as
in the training The only thing different is the gamemakers
watching and a food table to the side which the majority of
the gamemakers are occupied with Katniss goes to the
archery station She picks up a bow and quiver full of
arrows She shoots an arrow at the target but misses She
tries again She hits the bullseye and without missing a
beat rolls to the side and shoots an arrow hitting the
bullseye again She looks at the gamemakers Only 3
gamemakers are smiling and nodding at her performance The
others are occupied with the extra food She gets up from
her stance knocks an arrow and shoots it straight through
an apple on the table pinning it to the wall Every
gamemaker becomes quiet and looks straight at her Attention
is all on her She throws her bow quiver arm guard and
arrows to the side

They were singing some kind of
drinking song I threw some weights
around but I still wasn’t that
good

I dismissed myself

HAYMITCH
Well that’s that

KATNISS
Do you think they’1ll arrest me

HAYMITCH
Doubt it It’ll be a pain to
replace you at this stage

KATNISS
What about my family Will they
punish them

HAYMITCH
Don’t think so Wouldn’t make much
sense They’d have to reveal what
happened in the Training Center for
it to have any worthwhile effect on
the population People wouldn’t
need to know what you did But they

HAYMITCH (contd)
can’t since it’s secret so it’d
be a waste of effort They’d just
make your life in the arena a
living hell

PEETA
They’ve already promised to do that
to us anyway

HAYMITCH
Very true

Haymitch grabs a roll of bread and chuckles

HAYMITCH
What were their faces like

KATNISS
Shocked Terrified Uh ridiculous
some of them One of them even
tripped backwards

Everyone but Effie laughs together

EFFIE
Well it serves them right It’s
their job to pay attention to you
Both of you And just because you
come from District twelve is no
excuse to ignore you I’m sorry
but that’s what I think

KATNISS
Thanks Effie but I don’t think it
matters now I’1ll get a bad score
anyways

PORTIA
Scores only matter if they’re good
No one pays attention to the bad or
mediocre ones For all they know
you could be hiding your talents to
get a low score on purpouse People
have used that strategy in the
past

PEETA
I hope that’s how people will
interpret the four I’m getting I
mean what’s more impressive than
throwing a pilates ball around
Everything And I’m not even good

Well there’s been another change
of plans as well

KATNISS
Great What now

HAYMITCH
Well it wasn’t going to bea

and Peeta has something he wishes
to keep secret for the interviews
and that’s the only reason why were
to coach you both Strategy
Secrets But as it seems you have
no real strategy planned like we
asked you to we’ve decided that
with the tight schedule we’ll keep
the private session for Peeta
Peeta you know where to meet me 4
oclock sharp

Peeta nods and walks away
HAYMITCH

should be grateful

Effie walks out with a smile

HAYMITCH
Did she teach you that too

Katniss nods

HAYMITCH
Good So I’ve gotten Peeta’s
themes- easy All that’s hard to do
is find your theme

KATNISS
And why is that

HAYMITCH
Peeta has a natural subtle and
likeable humor You Well it’s
not so easy to work with positivity
and you

KATNISS

That’s not very nice

HAYMITCH
Don’t get me wrong you’re pretty
incredible I mean you saved your
sister’s life got the highest
score possible and Cinna made you
unforgettable No one knows who you
are but they are intrigued This

HAYMITCH
Please Whoever that was in that
chariot she hasn’t shown up ever
since I’ve neer seen her before
that either I have no clue how
you pulled that off

KATNISS
(sarcastic tone)
Yes because you’ve given me so
many reasons to be cheery

HAYMITCH
You don’t have to please me you
have to please the audience The
sponsors From everything I’ve done
with you and from what Effie has
reported to me I’ve gathered a few
things Not only are you hostile
but I don’t know anything about
you We’ve been around you for
about two weeks asked you about
two hundred questions and we still
have no clue about who you really
are They want to know about you
Katniss

KATNISS
I don’t want them to They’re
already taking my future why
should I let them take my past

HAYMITCH
Then lie Make something up

KATNISS
I’m not good at lying

Katniss’ heart

KATNISS
If it is what you meant by that I
wouldn’t care if I became an avox
I wouldn’t care if I died I
should’ve kept you and that boy
safe It’s all my fault

The avox girl shakes her head
KATNISS

It doesn’t matter what you imply I

know it was my fault
The avox girl looks around her She finds a napkin and a pen
on the floor She writes I forgive you She shows it to
Katniss Then she adds If that matters at all They smile

I couldn’t do it I just can’t be
one of those people he wants me to
be

CINNA
Why don’t you just be yourself

KATNISS
Myself That’s no good either
Haymitch called me sullen and
hostile He dismissed me with a Do
whatever you want I give up

CINNA
Well then do whatever you want
Just like he said Plus I don’t
find you the way he does The prep
team adores you as well You’ve
even won over the Gamemakers As
for the citizens of the Capitol
they just can’t stop talking about
you No one can help but admire
your spirit Suppose that when
youre answering the questions
imagine you’re adressing your
closest friend back home Who’s
your best friend

KATNISS
Gale But it just makes no sense
Cinna He wouldn’t be asking I
would’ve already told him

CINNA
What about me Could you think of
me as a friend

KATNISS
I think so but-

CINNA
I’1l be sitting on the main
platform You’ll be able to look at
me and answer the questions as
honestly as possible Be completely
honest

back home Right

Cheers from the audience Peeta shakes his head hesitantly

CAESAR
You’ve got to be kidding

PEETA
Well there is one girl I’ve hada
crush on her ever since I can
remember I’m pretty sure she
didn’t know I existed until the
reaping

Sympathy from the audience

CAESAR
Does she have a fellow
PEETA
I don’t know but a lot of boys

like her

CAESAR
Here’s what you do You win you go
home She can’t turn you down then

PEETA
I don’t think that’s gonna work
Winning won’t help in my case

CAESAR
Why not
PEETA
Because she came here with me

Awkward silence fills the room

Shouts of

Deafening

CAESAR
Oh That’s is a big piece of bad
luck

PEETA
It’s not good

CAESAR
I don’t think any of us can blame
you It’d be hard not to fall for
that young lady She didn’t know

PEETA
Not until now

CAESAR
Wouldn’t you love to pull her back
up here and ask for a response

agreement from the audience

CAESAR
Sadly rules are rules and Katniss

TRACKER JACKERS

Katniss flutters her eyes open It is very early

morning She looks at the tree next to her Rue stares at
her Rue points to a branch Katniss looks there and right
nearby her she sees a tracker jacker nest It emits a low
hum of a sound the tracker jackers buzzing around She
looks at Rue with wide eyes as she realizes what it is Rue
makes sawing motions with her hands Katniss hesitates She
takes out the knife and begins sawing the branch As she
does three tracker jackers sting her She squeaks and
winces but keeps going She pushes it off of the tree as
hard as she can The tracker jackers swarm the mob in their
sleep The mob members awaken They jump up and run towards
the lake They shout cries of various types from Tracker
jackers to The lake To the lake Glimmer falls to the
ground covered in sting She dies Lacey does as well but
farther away than Glimmer is Katniss pulls the stingers out
of the stings she got She then climbs down Once she hits
the floor a tiny parachute carryng extreme relief burn
ointment drops in front of her She picks it up opens it
and skims the top with her fingers

KATNISS
(whispered)
Haymitch Thank you

She takes more covering her hands and leg with it She
sighs with relief Her burns are healing rapidly She looks
at Glimmer’s corpse She notices the archery set She runs
over to it She kneels beside it and tries to lift her off
of the archery st underneath her She sucessfully does and

( )

retrieves the archery set She looks at the nest of the
tracker jackers Completely empty Peeta appears She
fumbles with the bow and arrow but it falls out of her
hands Peeta runs up to her He helps her up pushing her
the other direction

PEETA
What’re you still doing here Are
you mad Get up Get up Run

Cato and the remaining careers run back towards them Peeta
gives her one last push

PEETA
Go

She takes off with run She looks back Peeta is trying to
run from Cato as well but he is slashed on the leg by Cato
He escapes anyways Cato throws down his sword in
frustration Katniss runs off Once out of sight Katniss
stumbles to the ground from the run

KATNISS
What’s happening to me

She blacks out on the dirt floor

CUT TO

RUE

Katniss wakes up from a nightmare It’s nearly sunset She
takes the water bottle from her backpack and drinks out of
it She stands up and stretches putting away the water
bottle She puts the quiver of arrows on her back and picks
up the bow A rustle is heard Rue hides Katniss raises her
bow with an arrow ready to fire She spots Rue She puts
her guard down

KATNISS
You know they’re not the only ones
that can form alliances

Rue peeks out from behind

RUE
You want me for an ally

KATNISS
Why not You saved me from those
tracker jackers You’re smart
enough to stay alive And I can’t

(MORE)
( )
79

KATNISS (cont’d)
seem to shake you anyway You
hungry I can spare some food You
know if you’re an ally

Rue steps out in the open

RUE
I can fix your stings

KATNISS
Can you How

Rue pulls out a handful of leaves She walks up to Katniss

KATNISS
Where did you find those

RUE
Just around We all carry them when
we work in the orchards They left
alot of nests there There are alot
here too

KATNISS
Oh yeah you live in district
eleven Agriculture Orchards huh
That must be how you can fly around
the trees like you got wings

Rue smiles

KATNISS
Well come on then Are you gonna
fix me up

RUE
Where are your stings

KATNISS
There’s one on my leg that’s really
bothering me

Katniss rolls up her pants leg to show her sting Rue chews
the leaves She then spits it on the sting Katniss sighs
Rue laughs at her reply to the treatment

RUE
Lucky you had the sense to pull the
stingers out or you’d be alot
worse

( )

KATNISS
Do that to my other stings

Rue treats the other stings They smile at eachother
Katniss looks at the burn on Rue’s arm

KATNISS
I’ve got something for that

She takes out the burn ointment She spreads it on Rue’s
then spreads some on her own burns

RUE
You have good sponsors

KATNISS
Have you gotten anything yet

Rue shakes her head

KATNISS
You will though Watch The closer
we get to the end the more people
will realize how clever you are

RUE
You weren’t joking about wanting me
for an ally

KATNISS
No I mean it

RUE
Okay It’s a deal

They shake hands Katniss takes out half of her crackers and

beef jerky and gives it to Rue

RUE
I haven’t had this much to eat
before

KATNISS

Really I’d think that since you
live in the agriculture and farming
district you’d get tons of food to
eat

RUE
Oh no We’re not allowed to eat
any of the crops The mayor’s very
strict about that But sometimes
we get a small ration

( )

Rue nods

KATNISS
Like tessera

KATNISS
What happens if you eat the crops
you grow

RUE
They whip you and make the whole
town watch

KATNISS

Well then this is your lucky day

Take whatever you want Now that I
have my bow and arrows I can hunt
for virtually anything Plus I
know how to set up snares And I
can gather And fish So I think
were okay I’m sure you’re way
better than me at gathering and
harvesting Maybe even growing
plants too We’re definitely good
to go

RUE
I hope you win Katniss

KATNISS
Why do you say that

RUE
Well just look at me I’m lucky
I’m still alive

KATNISS
You know what I seeI see a
survivor I hope you win Rue

Rue smiles gratefully at Katniss Katniss smiles back
Katniss shuffles through her backpack Rue stops her when
she sees the glasses

RUE
Where did you get those

KATNISS
They came with the pack Why

RUE
They let you see in complete
darkness

( )

Katniss takes it out of her backpack and examines it She

tries them on

KATNISS

You’re right I wonder who else got

a pair of these

RUE
The Careers have two pairs They’
got everything down by the lake
They’re so strong

KATNISS
We’re strong too Just ina
different way

RUE
You are You can shoot What can
do

KATNISS

You can feed yourself Can they

RUE

They don’t need to They have all

those supplies

KATNISS

Say they didn’t Say the supplies

were gone How long would they
last I mean it’s the Hunger
Games right

RUE
But Katniss they’re not hungry

KATNISS
No they’re not That’s the
problem I think we’re going to
have to fix that Rue

THIRD TIME’S THE CHARM

Katniss and Rue are asleep It is morning
off

KATNISS
Who do you think that was

ve

I

CUT TO

The cannon goes

( )
83

RUE
I don’t know It could have been
anyone I guess we’ll find out
tonight

KATNISS
Who’s left again

RUE
The boy from district one both
from two the boy from three
Thresh me Peeta and you That
makes eight Wait nine There’s
the boy from district ten too

KATNISS
Isn’t there someone else

RUE
I forgot who Don’t you wonder how
the last one died

KATNISS
There’s no telling But it could
be good for us A death should hold
the crowd for a bit It’ll bea
while until the Gamemakers decide
that there’s not enough action So
are you ready

RUE
For what

KATNISS
Today we’re taking out the
career’s food

RUE
Really How
KATNISS
I have no idea We’ll figure out a

plan
They pack up and begin walking towards the careers

RUE
I’ve spied on them

KATNISS
Really

( )

RUE
Yes The boy from district three is
working with them The food’s out
in the open as well

KATNISS
Something’s not quite right about
that setup

RUE
I know But I couldn’t tell what
exactly Katniss even if you could
get to the food how would you get
rid of it

KATNISS
Burn it Dump it in the lake Soak
it in fuel Or eat it Don’t
worry I’1ll think of something
Destroying things is much easier
than making them

RUE
We need a plan soon Katniss I
have a few ideas We could use the
mockingjays to signal that we’re
okay I’1l whistle this tune-

Rue whistles her four note tune

RUE

(contd)
-and that’1ll be carried on by the
mockingjays and onto you Then
youd reply with another tune and
itd be carried to me I’1ll make
distractions and you’1ll get the job
done

Katniss nods

KATNISS
I’‘ll whistle this as a reply

She whistles her own four note tune

RUE
Okay

KATNISS
So we’re set then We’1ll meet here
once the job is done okay

( )
85

Katniss begins walking in the direction of the careers’ food
stash

RUE
Katniss

Katniss turns around

KATNISS
Yes

RUE
Be careful

KATNISS
You too Stay safe

They go their separate ways
CUT TO

Katniss hides behind a cluster of bushes She glares at the
mob consisting of only Cato Marvel Clove and Andrew
Cato points at something in the sky The mob runs to it
Katniss notices that they all jump in specific spots as if
to avoid something under their feet On top of the stack of
food she sees an opened bag of apples She knocks an arrow
on her bow aims carefully and tries to shoot it at the
apples She barely misses She tries again So close yet so
far One more try The arrow knocks the apples over all of
them falling down and rolling in differnt places A HUGE
explosion The food is blasted to nothing Katniss is blown
far back Katniss gets up wobbly and disoriented She trips
and falls many times Her left ear is bleeding She trips
over one last time and blacks out

CUT TO

GOODBYE

Katniss awakens She is disoriented The blood on her ear
has crusted up She gets up She leans against a tree The
mockingjays mimic Rue’s four note tune Rue is heard from
afar

RUE
Katniss

Katniss doesn’t register her voice She knocks an arrow on
her bow looking around for the source of sound

( )
86

RUE
Katniss

KATNISS
Rue Rue

Katniss runs towards the source of sound

RUE
Katniss Help

KATNISS
Rue I’m coming

Katniss reaches the area Rue is in a rope net lying on the
floor Rue reaches for Katniss Rue is impaled with a spear
thrown into her stomach by Marvel Katniss screams She
shoots an arrow at his neck He falls over to his death

KATNISS
Are there more Rue are there
more

RUE
No

Katniss rushes to Rue’s side She throws the bow to her side
and drops to her knees beside Rue She takes out her knife
and cuts the rope out of the way so she can examine the
wounds The spear is dug deep into her stomach to the point
of no return Katniss’ eyes well up with tears Rue
frequently winces in pain from the wounds and sobbing a
lot

RUE
Did you blow up the food
KATNISS
Every last bit
RUE
You have to win
KATNISS
I’m going to I will win for the

both of us
The cannon goes off Katniss looks up Rue takes her hand

RUE
Don’t go

( )

KATNISS
I’m staying right here

RUE
Sing

Katniss hesitates She begins her song
KATNISS

Deep in the meadow under the
willow A bit of grass a soft

green pillow Lay down your head

and close your sleepy eyes And

when again they open the sun will

rise

Here it’s safe here it’s warm
Here the daisies guard you from

every harm Here your dreams are

sweet and tommorow brings them

true Here’s the place where I love

you

Rue becomes unconcious her sobs dying down

Deep in the meadow hidden far

away A cloak of leaves a moonbeam
ray Forget your woes and let your
troubles lay and when again it’s

morining they’1l wash away

Here it’s safe here it’s warm
here the daisies guard you from

every harm Here your dreams are

sweet and tommorow brings them

true Here’s the place where I love

you

Katniss gently lays Rue’s head back on the ground as she
gets up Katniss gathers wildflowers and brings them back to
Rue’s body She keels beside her and dresses Rue’s body with
flowers She covers her wounds covers her hair in flowers
and surrounds her body with flowers She puts the last
flower down She kisses her hand in the Panem salute sign 3
fingers outstretched and her 2 outside fingers folded down

and outstretches it to Rue’s corpse

KATNISS
Goodbye Rue

She gets up picks up her bow and leaves
BLACK OUT

The cannon fires

FADE TO

A SEARCH FOR LIFE
Katniss sits in a tree hugging her knees

KATNISS
Rue

A few moments pass She sobs She buries her head into her
knees Just then Claudius’ voice booms from overhead

CLAUDIUS

camouflaged He smiles at her

( )
89

KATNISS

Katniss attemps to move Peeta into the stream Peeta cries
out in pain

KATNISS
I’m going to roll you into the
stream It’s really shallow there

of three One two three

She rolls him up to the edge of the bank He screams out in
pain

KATNISS
Okay change of plans

PEETA
No more rolling

KATNISS
That’s all done Keep an eye on the
woods for me okay

She takes her water bottles out fills it with water and
begins dowsing him down washing off everything on his upper
body She treats his burns minor cuts bruises and stings

KATNISS
You must be hungry

PEETA
Not really It’s funny actually I

She looks at the leg wound She pours water over it and
sees the damage

KATNISS
Eugh

( )

Katniss hands him some food She begins dressing the wound

from him

( )

KATNISS
Burn medicine and bread You

PEETA
Nothing I always knew he was your
favorite

KATNISS
Please he can’t stand being in the

PEETA
(muttered)
Because you’re so alike

Katniss rolls her eyes

KATNISS
We have to go now

PEETA

KATNISS

Away from here Downstream maybe
Somewhere we can hide you until
you’re stronger

She props him up and has him lean on her She begins to move
forward but he’s not able to

KATNISS
Come on you can do this

Peeta limps with Katniss as she guides him

IF ALL GOES WRONG

PEETA
(whispered)

Peeta falls asleep A mini parachute falls in front of her
It holds a pot of broth and a tiny spoon

HAYMITCH
(VO surreal)
One kiss equals one pot of broth

me something to work with

Katniss shakes Peeta awake
KATNISS
Peeta Look at what Haymitch sent

95

KATNISS
Well there’s more swelling but

Katniss Even if my mother isn’t a
healer

KATNISS
You’re just going to have to
outlast the others Peeta They’1l
cure it back at the capitol when we
win

Trumpets blare Katniss jumps It’s an announcement from
Claudius

CLAUDIUS
Hello my goodhearted tributes In
celebration of coming this far

on Some of you may be declining my
invitation already but this is no
ordinary feast Each of you needs
something desperately Each of you
will find that something ina
backpack marked with your district
number at the cornuopia at dawn
Think hard about whether or not
you’1l show up For some of you
this will be your last chance

Katniss begins to get up Peeta stops her

PEETA
You’re not risking your life for
me

KATNISS

Who said I was

PEETA
So you’re not going

KATNISS
Of course I’m not going Give me
some credit Do you really think
I’m running straight into some
free-for-all against Cato and Clove
and Thresh Don’t be stupid

( )

You’re

PEETA

I won’t die I promise Only if you
promise not to go

KATNISS

I’m sorry Peeta but I may have to

gamble

I don’t want to lose you I

may die but this is a better bet
than leaving you like this

Katniss gets up and leaves the cave A tiny parachute lands

in front of her

It holds sleep medicine She takes berries

out of her pocket douses them with the medicine and heads

back to the cave

PEETA

Changed your mind

I wasn’

them before

PEETA
No but they taste familiar Sugar
berries

KATNISS

Well you can’t get them much on
the market They grow wild

PEETA
They’re sweet as syrup Syrup

His eyes widen He falls asleep Katniss gets up

KATNISS
Who can’t lie Peeta

She puts on the night glasses takes her bow and arrows and
walks out of the cave

CUT TO

Katniss scopes the arena from behing a bush The table in
the middle of the cornucopia holds two large backpacks one
marked with an 11 and the other labeled 2 There’s a medium
sized backpack with a 5 on it The last one is a miniature
backpack small enough to fit in someone’s hand labeled 12
Foxface darts to the table takes the one labeled 5 and
leaves Katniss grunts She runs towards the table Clove
throws a knife at Katniss She blocks it Katniss shoots an
arrow into Clove’s upper left arm Clove rips out the arrow
with a grunt Clove charges at Katniss knocking her down
Clove pins her down

CLOVE
Where’s your boyfriend district
twelve Still hanging on

KATNISS
He’s out there right now Hunting
Cato Peeta

Clove clamps her hand over Katniss’ mouth Clove looks
around her

( )

CLOVE

Liar He’s nearly dead Cato knows
where he cut him You’ve probably
got him strapped up in some tree
while you try to keep his heartbeat
going What’s in the pretty little
backpack Medicine for lover boy
Too bad he’ll never get it

(she takes out a knife)
I promised Cato that if he let me
have you I’d give everyone a show

(Katniss struggles)
Forget it district twelve We’re
going to kill you Just like we did
your patheric useless little ally
What’s her name Rue Well first
Rue then you and I think we’1ll
let nature take care of little
lover boy of yours Sounds good
Good Now where to start I think
you won’t have any use or your lips
anymore Want to blow one last kiss
to lover boy

(Katniss spits in Clove’s

face Clove wipes it off)
All right then Let’s get started

Clove is thrown back by Thresh Katniss sits up to see

what’s going on Thresh pins Clove to the ground

THRESH
What did you do to that little
girl You killed her

CLOVE
No No it wasn’t me

THRESH
You said her name I heard you You
killed her You cut her up like you
were gonna do this girl

CLOVE
No No I- I- Cato Cato

Thresh slams the rock into the side of Clove’s head Cato
begins running towards Clove

CATO
(from afar)
Clove

Thresh gets up He faces Katniss

( )
99

THRESH
What did she mean about Rue being
your ally

KATNISS
We teamed up Blew up the supplies
I tried to save her I really did
But then district one came along

CATO
(closer still far)
Clove

THRESH
And you killed him

KATNISS
Yes I killed him I buried her in
flowers and sang her to sleep

THRESH
To sleep

KATNISS
To death I sang until she died
Your district they sent me

bread You know what Just- just do
it fast okay Thresh

THRESH
This one time Just this one time
I’1l let you go

CATO
(closer)
Clove

THRESH
You better go fire girl

Katniss takes the backpack from Clove’s corpse and runs off
The cannon fires She hesitates looks back and sees Cato
kneeled over Clove’s body begging her to stay alive Cato
gets up and runs towards Thresh full speed She turns away
and runs towards the cave The cannon fires

CUT TO

It is night Katniss jogs into the cave She collapses
beside Peeta who is sleeping Her eyebrow is bleeding very
badly Katniss rips open the backpack She finds a syringe
with medicine in it She plunges the needle into Peeta and
inserts the medicine She takes it out puts it to the side
and falls asleep

( )

BLACK OUT

THAT’S WHAT I’M LOOKING FOR SWEETHEART
It is morning It’s raining Peeta shakes Katniss

PEETA
Katniss Katniss can you hear me

She opens her eyes

PEETA
Hey Good to see your eyes again

Katniss sits up

KATNISS
How long have I been out

PEETA
Not sure I woke up yesterday
evening and you were lying ina
pool of blood I think the bleeding
finally stopped but I wouldn’t sit
up if I were you

KATNISS

Did you bandage my head
PEETA

Of course
KATNISS

You seem better

PEETA
Much better Whatever you gave me
did the trick By this morning
almost all the swelling went down

KATNISS
Did you eat

PEETA
I’m sorry to say I gobbled down
three pieces of groosling before I
realized it might have to last a
while Don’t worry I’m back on a
strict diet

FADE TO

awake

( )
101

KATNISS
No that’s good You need to eat
I’1l1 go hunting soon

PEETA
Not to soon all right You just
let me take care of you fora
while

Thunder clap

PEETA
I wonder what’s going on with the
weather I mean who’s the target

KATNISS
Cato and Thresh Foxface would be
hiding and Clove

PEETA
I know Clove is dead I saw it in
the sky last night Did you kill

her

KATNISS
Thresh bashed her skull in with a
rock

PEETA

Lucky he didn’t catch you too

KATNISS
He did but he let me go

PEETA
He let you go

KATNISS
Yes I don’t expect you to
understand it If you lived in the
Seam I might have considered it

PEETA
Obviously I’m too dim to get it

KATNISS
Too bad See it’s like the bread
I can never get over owing you for
that

PEETA
The bread What from when when we
were kids I think we can let that

(MORE)
( )
102

PEETA (contd)
go I mean you did just resurrect
me from the dead

KATNISS
But you didn’t know me We’d never
even spoken back then Besides
it’s the first gift that’s always
the hardest to pay back I wouldnt
have even been alive if you hadn’t
helped me then Why did you

anyways

PEETA
Why You know why

KATNISS
I don’t

PEETA

Haymitch said you would take a lot
of convincing

KATNISS
Haymitch What’s he got to do with
it

PEETA

Nothing So Cato and Thresh huh
I guess I’d be spouting too much
hope if I believed that they’d
simultaneously destroy eachother

KATNISS
I think you’d like Thresh He’d
probably be a good friend if he
lived in district twelve

PEETA
Let’s hope Cato kills him so we
don’t have to What is it Are you
in pain

KATNISS
I want to go home

PEETA
You will I promise

He kisses her forehead

( )
103

KATNISS
I hope Thresh is still alive

PEETA
Hey Katniss I’m sorry I didn’t
tell you but Thresh died

KATNISS
- What

PEETA
His face was shown after Clove’s
I’m sorry

KATNISS
No it’s alright I’m just glad he
doesn’t have to go through this
nonsense anymore In a way I wish
it were me But I’m not going to
give up Not at this rate

PEETA
I guess I agree I’m glad we can
stay together if we stick this
through

KATNISS
Hey Peeta In the interviews you
said you had a crush on me forever
When did forever start

PEETA
Oh let’s see I guess the first
day of school We were five You
had two braids and a red plaid
dress My father pointed you out
while we were waiting in line

KATNISS
Me Why

PEETA
He said ‘See that little girl I
wanted to marry her mother but she
ran off with a coal miner’

KATNISS
What You’re making that up

PEETA
No true story I said ‘A coal
miner Why did she want a coal
miner if she could’ve had you’ He
(MORE)

( )

PEETA (contd)
said ‘Because when he sings even
the birds stop to listen’

KATNISS
That’s true They do I mean they
did

PEETA
So that day in the music assembly
the teacher asked who knew the
valley song Your hand shot up in
the air She stood you up on a
stool and had you sing it for us I
swear every bird outside the
windows fell silent

KATNISS
Oh please

PEETA
No it happened And when your song
ended I knew -just like your
mother- I was a goner Then for teh
next elevn years I tried to work
up the nerve to talk to you

KATNISS
Without success

PEETA
Without success So in a way my
name being drawn in the reaping was
a real piece of luck

KATNISS
You have a remarkable memory

PEETA
I remember everything about you
You’re the one who wasn’t paying
attention

KATNISS
I am now

PEETA
Well I don’t have much competition
for you here

KATNISS
You don’t have competition
anywhere

( )

They are about to kiss when a metallic plunk sound comes
from outside Peeta gets up to check it up He yells out in
delight Katniss gets up to see what was Another miniature

parachute

has dropped down holding a big meal for the both

of them Katniss drops down and examines it Peeta follows

FOXFACE’S

It is day

PEETA
I guess Haymitch got tired of
watching us starve

KATNISS
I guess so

CUT TO

DEATH
Katniss walks through the forest

KATNISS
(V0)
20 down two to go That was my
motivation Stick it through with
Peeta I’d been hunting for
practically a day I didn’t realize
that Peeta didn’t whistle back

The cannon goes off Katniss’ eyes widen She runs around
the forest her bow drawn back She stops in an area with
berries in a pile nex to the orange backpack frantically
looking around

KATNISS
(VO)
This is where we were supposed to
meet
KATNISS
Peeta Peeta Where are you
PEETA
Oh hey Katniss I found some

berries

Peeta walks out from behind a bush

KATNISS
What are you doing You were
supposed to meet me over here not
running around the woods

( )
106

PEETA
I found some berries down by the
stream

KATNISS

Why didn’t you whistle I said to
whistle every 5 minutes You didn’t
whistle for an hour I thought Cato
killed you

PEETA
No I’m fine Are you okay

KATNISS
When two people agree on a signal
they stay in range If one of them
doesn’t answer it means they’re in
trouble all right

PEETA
All right

KATNISS
Don’t ever do that to me again
That’s what happened to Rue I was
careless We were careless I
watched her die And you probably
ate without me too Where’s the
food

PEETA
It was right there where I left it

KATNISS
Oh and I suppose the apples ate
the cheese then the apples ate
themselves

PEETA
I don’t know what ate the food but
it wasn’t me I’ve been down by the
stream collecting berries Would
you care for some

Peeta holds out nightlock She takes it suspiciously
examining it

FADE TO

Foxface runs by the stash of Peeta and Katniss’ food She
stops puts berries in her pocket then takes their meal
from the sponsors and runs She puts a handful of the
nightlock in her mouth and chews it while running She
slows collapses to the ground and dies

( )

KATNISS
Peeta Did you hear that cannon
fire before I think I think

that may have been Foxface

PEETA
Wait what Quick climb up the
tree We’ll stand a better chance
against him above ground

KATNISS
No Peeta She’s you kill not
Cato’s

PEETA
What I haven’t even seen her since
the first day How could I have
killed her

KATNISS
Think about it She’s clever She
took something we were preparing to
eat for ourselves You picked the
berries so you killed her She
took the berries and our meals

PEETA
I don’t get it They’re just
berries

KATNISS
They’re nightlock They kill you
instantly

PEETA
It feel like I cheated If she
didn’t eat them first I probably
wouldve died I was going to eat
some myself until you arrived I’m
sorry Katniss I really thought
they were the same ones youd
gathered

KATNISS
Don’t apologize It just means
were one step closer to home
right

PEETA
I’1l get rid of the rest

FADE TO

( )
108

KATNISS
Wait If they fooled Foxface maybe
they can fool Cato as well If he’s
chasing us or something we can act
like we accidently drop a pouch of
it and if he eats them-

PEETA
Hello district twelve

KATNISS
Well there’s no hiding now Let’s
face him To the lake

PEETA
To the lake

Katniss and Peeta gather their things and leave

CUT TO

MUTATIONS
EXT Lake- DAY Sunset

Katniss and Peeta sit beside the lake The mockingjays
chirp Katniss whistles Rue’s four note tune The
mockingjays stop to listen She whistles it again The
mockingjays repeat She closes her eyes listening She
smiles

PEETA
Just like your father

KATNISS
That’s Rue’s signal whistle I
think they’1ll remember it

Cato runs full speed out from behind them Katniss and Peeta
ready tehir weapons Cato runs right past them Katniss and
Peeta stand their dumb founded Huge wolves each
resembling a different tribute that has died -muttations-
jump out from the woods Katniss grabs Peeta and runs in the
same direction as Cato They run towards the cornucopia
Cato seems to be attemting to climb a tree Katniss climbs
up a tree Katniss helps Peeta up The wolves break into the
clearing Cato climbs up the tree beside them as well The
wolves begin to run towards the remaining tributs

KATNISS
It’s them The others Rue and
Foxface and all of them

( )
109

Peeta yells out A muttation had slashed Peeta Katniss
draws back her bow and drives an arrow through the
muttation She looks back to see that Cato has snatched
Peeta away holding him hostage She draws back her bow and
aims it at his head

CATO
I go down he goes down

Peeta raises his arm and draws an X on Cato’s arm Katniss
shoots her second to last arrow where Peeta drew the X Cato
lets go of Peeta and falls into the huge crowd of
muttations Peeta catches himself on the tree Katniss jumps
to the other tree where Peeta is Cries of pain from Cato
Katniss turns her attention to Peeta’s leg It’s badly cut
Blood is spouting out of his leg Katniss takes her belt and
tightly ties it around his leg cutting off circulation The
muttations walk away leaving Cato’s shredded gruesome body
in shreds

KATNISS
Don’t go to sleep

PEETA
Katniss can you shoot him

Katniss nods drawing back her bow

PEETA
Make it count

Katniss aims at Cato’s skull
CATO
(squeaked)
Please
Katniss looks away and shoots
KATNISS
(whispered)

I’m sorry

PEETA
Did you get him

The cannon fires

PEETA
We won Katniss

( )

KATNISS
(dull)
Hurray for us

They wait Nothing happens

KATNISS
(shouted)
Hey What’s going on

PEETA
Maybe it’s the body We should
distance ourselves from it Was
that in the other Games

KATNISS
Not sure Do you think you could
make it far enough

PEETA
I think I’d better try

Katniss helps him out of the tree

Katniss throws the knife to the ground beside Peeta’s feet

KATNISS

PEETA

You know I can’t
He picks up the knife and throws it far away

KATNISS
Stop being a coward We both know

He untightens the belt that it cutting his circulation off
Katniss stops him She tightens it once again

KATNISS
No You can’t kill yourself If you
kill yourself I will too

HAYMITCH

Katniss laughs They pull away

KATNISS

to Prim It’s all that matters to
me Screw the capitol

HAYMITCH

She kisses his cheek Crowd goes wild

CAESAR
All right all right settle down
So Peeta we know from your five
or so days in the cave that it was
love at first sight You were in
love since you were five

PEETA
From the moment I laid eyes on her

CAESAR
But Katniss what a ride for you
I think the real excitement for teh
audience was watching you fall for
him When did you realize you were
in love with him

KATNISS
Oh well that’s a hard one

CAESAR
I think I know when it hit me That
night when you shouted out his name
from the tree

KATNISS
Yes I guess that was it I mean
until that point I didn’t think
about my feelings because it made
it confusing and all the worse But
up in that tree everything
changed

( )
115

CAESAR
Why is that
KATNISS
Because for the first time for

the first time there was a chance
I could keep him

Sighs from the audience

PEETA
So now that you’ve got me what’1l
you do

KATNISS

Put you somewhere safe

CAESAR
You two are a true match made in
heaven So Peeta things got
really rough with you and your leg
How’s your new leg working

KATNISS
New leg

Katniss knocks on Peeta’s left leg giving off a metallic
sound

CAESAR
No one told you

PEETA
I haven’t had the chance

KATNISS
It’s my fault

PEETA
Yes it’s your fault I’m alive

CAESAR
He’s right He would’ve bled to
death without you So Katniss I
want to know what went on in your
mind when you took those berries

too Care to tell

KATNISS
Well I don’t know I just
couldn’t bear the thought of being
without him

Coaching you but not me

( )
117

KATNISS
He knew you were smart enough to

KATNISS
No I couldn’t even talk to him in
the aena could I

PEETA
But you knew what he wanted you to
do huh Katniss
