FADE IN
INT ALICES - NIGHT - EXTREMELY CLOSE ON
a moving wall of muscled skin tinged blue by moonlight
Four claw-like scratches are raked across this landscape in
bright red Throaty guttural MOANS drift up from somewhere
Are we in heaven Or hell
TIGHT SHOTS ON
A delicate hand caressing a muscled bishop
A womans leg entwined around a mans
A cascade of red hair falling across an unshaven cheek
Two faces pressed tightly together in a kiss
The faces belong to ALICE and DAN and as their moans build
to a crescendo we realize it isnt pain were hearing but the
opposite Afterwards

ALICES HANDS

gently rove Dans back tenderly caressing the scratches
theyve just made

CLOSE ON ALICE

her relaxed happy face gazes up from the pillow She turns
and smiles at Dan

Dan sleepily smiles back then gently reaches out to caress
her shoulder Their eyes hold for a moment Alice leans

over and kisses him

ALICE
Im going to take a shower

Dan nods and closes his eyes still smiling Alice climbs
from bed FOLLOW HER

INT ALICES BATHROOM - NIGHT - ON SHOWER DRAIN

Water pours down into the drain from the shower TIGHT on
Alices HEAD AND SHOULDERS as she steps INTO FRAME and stands
under the cascading water

IN THE SHOWER

The hot water streams down onto Alices face She scrubs
herself clean The water beats down on her shoulders and

back She rinses her hair Shakes her wet head

THE DRAIN
gives an odd gurgle like something had backed up the
plumbing

ALICE

glances down Nothing Turns back the jets of water The
pressure builds up a little She turns it down

THE DRAIN

the gurgles again The water starts to back up rising
around Alices feet

ALICES POV

She notices Leans down perturbed as the water reaches her
ankles and tries to clear the drain No success The water
continues to back up

ALICE
Oh great The drain monster strikes
again

ALICE

stands back up now a little apprehensive As the water
rises to her knees the pressure from the shower jet suddenly
DOUBLES Gallons of water now BLAST into the shower Alice
tries to turn it off but the handles come off in her hands

She tries to open the shower door IT WONT BUDGE Shes
trapped and now the water is climbing to her neck Frantic
Alice POUNDS on the glass

THE SHOWER

Completely full Alice stands inside completely under
water slamming her fists against the door in desperation
Suddenly

INT CORRIDOR OF DOORS - NIGHT

the door opens But it is no longer Alices glass shower
door Its one of the heavy doors in the asylum As it
opens toward CAMERA Alice stumbles out of the STATIC WALL OF
WATER into a dark room The door closes behind her and melts

into the wall

Alice looks around She is in a dark empty corridor Two
doors flank both ends of the hallway One opens

Alice tries to peer beyond it Darkness Slowly she gets
to her feet and steps through it

ANOTHER DOOR

further on opens beckoning her forward And another door
beyond that And another Cautiously Alice moves down this
corridor of invitations until

INT ASYLUM - TIGHT ON ALICE

as she steps through the last door Shadows and light play
across her face She looks around What she sees sends fear
into her eyes This is where Amanda Krueger was raped The
asylum

PULL BACK

slowly down the length of this nightmarish room Fingers of
lights stab up from crusting floor grates and reach through
the thick murky air toward a dark cathedral ceiling whos
beams appear to be made from the bones of some unearthly
creature

CAMERA CONTINUES BACK

revealing beds and mattresses crowded along the walls Old
Filthy Some torn to pieces We can make out the figures of
men lying in them And others milling around These are
AMANDAS HUNDRED MANIACS All dressed in the garb of 1940s
mental patients Some pace aimlessly Devoid of sanity and
purpose Others sit lost in their own private hells No
one has noticed Alice Yet At the end of the room

CAMERA CRANES UP CONTINUING BACK

revealing a staircase that leads to a huge IRON DOOR Two
ORDERLIES hover on the landing before it gazing into the dim
scene below One of them pokes his finger into the dark
silently counting The other is eager to go

ORDERLY 1
Come on will ya

ORDERLY 2
Shut up youll make me lose count
eighty-two eighty-three

ALICE

looks down at herself Now she is dressed in an old
fashioned nurses uniform White and starched There is a
name tag over her left breast It reads AMANDA KRUEGER

Alice barely has time to react when she hears the first
orderly impatiently say

ORDERLY 1
Close enough Lets call it a hundred
and call it a day

We hear the SOUND of RUSTY HINGES as the heavy door starts to
swing closed Alice looks up Starts moving toward it
ALICE
NoWAIT

ON THE DOOR

As it slams closed with a resounding CLANG We hear the
SOUND of heavy bolts being thrown in place

ALICE

whirls around WHIP PAN with her as she discovers that the
door she came through is no longer there

She turns back to the room frightened Starts moving for
the bolted steel door at the far end As she hurries
forward the maniacs notice her All heads turn Horrible
faces peer at her from everywhere Some of the men move
toward the center of the room blocking her way

Alice stops There is no way past them to the door She
turns The maniacs move in on her from all directions

ALICES POV

Freddys hundred fathers A drooling macabre parade of
human beings Hands grope toward her Hideous faces leer

ALICE
watches terrified
ALICES POV

This is looking less like an insane asylum in the 1940s and
more like a nightmare scene of Londons 16th century Bedlam

The maniacs converge on her One pushes his way through the
others (we recognize him as Robert Englund sans Freddy
make-up) As he reaches toward her

HIGH SHOT LOOKING DOWN

as CAMERA begins to descend pushing in moving closer the
maniacs surround her As they begin to drag her down Alice

turns her face up toward CAMERA PUSH IN EXTREMELY CLOSE as
she SCREAMS

MATCH CUT TO
INT ALICES BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
Alice lunges up from bed INTO FRAME SCREAMING Dan
immediately sits up beside her concerned A hand rests on

her shoulder between them Alice realizes where she is

ALICE
Jesus
CAMERA TRACKS AROUND

until Alices profile blocks Dans face The following line
begins OFF SCREEN during the CAMERA TRACK

VOICE (0OS)
Whats the matter hon Bad dream

Suddenly ENGLUNDs leering face pushes into FOREGROUND FRAME
beside Alice Its his hand on her shoulder and we realize
that he spoke the line not Dan She turns startled then
SCREAMS

Englund rolls on top of her pinning her to the mattress
CLOSE ON ENGLUND

grinning down at her his tongue snaking out his mouth

ENGLUND
Theres no such thing as safe sex

ALICE

pushes him away with every ounce of her strength She starts
to sit up

INT ALICES - EARLY MORNING

Alice sits up terrified Looks around in panic Realizes
shes alone in bed Wheres Dan She reflexively glances
toward her open bedroom window Its curtain gently billows
with the morning breeze Dan has gone home

Alice tries to collect herself The dream is over But we
can tell by her face that she is far from all right She
pulls on a robe and shakily climbs from bed

INT ALICES BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING
Alice moves toward the shower Pauses before it Takes a
breath and opens the door Looks inside Normal enough
Turns on the water Watches apprehensively as it pours
serenely down the drain Shed really rather not but Alice
reluctantly starts to remove her robe
DAN (0S)
we stand naked and defenseless before
an ever more unimaginable horror
SLOW DISSOLVE TO

EXT SPRINGWOOD HIGH - DAY

CLOSE ON SPRAY OF WATER FROM A LARGE FOUNTAIN
PAN DOWN from the water to a statue in the fountains center
And from the statue down to Dan dressed in a graduation cap
and gown Hes perched on the statues pedestal his arm
draped irreverently across the stone mans shoulder grinning
as he speaks

DAN
college High school was only the
beginning for some of us Dont forget
SAT stands for Sadistic Anti-human
Torture

WIDER

Laughter from a sea of fellow graduates who are gathered
round the base of the fountain outnumbered by their less
amused parents Beyond them we glimpse even more caps and
gowns milling with roving bands of adults

DAN (contd)
Most of us have just this one summer to
live and by live I meanpaaarty

The kids sends up a cheer as Dan throws his cap into the air
and leaps off the fountain He floats DOWN through a seas of
ASCENDING caps disappearing into the crown of students

PAN OVER TO GRETA AND HER MOTHER

standing at the edge of the group Greta is living proof of
what God can create when hes having a good day Shes
beautiful and fashion model-thin Her only flaw might be
the hint of neuroses in her perfection

Her mother RACINE GIBSON a once beautiful woman now
expanding into middle age raises a disapproving eyebrow
toward Dan and the boisterous kids around them

RACINE GIBSON
How colorful Who is he

GRETA
Dan Jordan Captain of our football
team

RACINE GIBSON
(with distaste)
Charming

ANGLE ON GRETA

a head TALLER than everyone around her as she suddenly
squeals with delight recognizing

GRETA
Alice Yvonne
Through the swirling crowd we see Alice standing with YVONNE
a very grounded black girl Her father stands with them
Alice is a little glum but Yvonne breaks into a wide grin as
they both turn toward Greta

YVONNE
Hey girl

Yvonne gives Alice a little tug and they hurry toward Greta
THE THREE GIRLS

Yvonne and Greta throw their arms around one another and send
up shrill noises of girlish delight Then Yvonne breaks into

YVONNE

ALICE

YVONNE

They laugh Greta feigns hormonal desperation

GRETA

MARK good-looking though considerably off-the-wall STEPS
INTO SHOT holding a SMALL SKETCHPAD and a LARGE EXCESSIVE
LOLLIPOP He speaks to her as though he were a fashion
photographer

MARK

Greta drops the pose and addresses the heavens

GRETA
(sarcastically)

RACINE GIBSON

Past her shoulder Greta indicates Mrs Gibson glaring
disapprovingly Mark gets conspiratorial

MARK

All turn as Marks father MR GREY approaches Mr Grey
steps into shot A rugged blue collar type he glances at
the girls then at Mark His hearty cheerfulness contains a
note of reproach

MR GREY
Hey Rembrandt No wonder I couldnt

Mark becomes uncomfortable in this big mans presence
MARK
Oh hi Dad I thought the guys could

They offer up a trio of hellos Alice turns to Mark
ALICE

There is an awkward beat as everyone falls quiet
ALICE
Good to see you again Mr Grey
(begs off)

YVONNE

As Alice turns away the cheerful face she put on dissolves
and we see that underneath shes still on the edge

FOLLOW ALICE through the crowd Suddenly a DARK SHAPE looms
up behind her lifting her
startled As the big arms
face with Dan He smiles

DAN

approaches through the crowd excited

ALICES DAD

ALICE
To take a picture

ANGLE ON PARENTS AND KIDS

lining up for a group photo Alice and her father ENTER
SHOT Alice hands her camera to someone just OFF SCREEN We
see them all taking places changing their minds moving next
to someone else Marks father puts a big arm around Gretas
mother Beams unaware of the horror and distaste that just
leapt onto Racines face

EXT HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER

Parents and off spring are moving toward their cars CAMERA
PANS across the crowd to

ALICE AND DAN
hugging Her father stands a few feet away

DAN
Call me when your shift ends

Alice nods Dan shakes her fathers hand
DAN (contd)
Goodbye sir Ill have her home by

Alices father frowns

ALICES DAD
You sure you dont want a ride to work

ALICE
Its just across the park

He climbs into the car Smiles his gruff smile

ALICES DAD
Okay angel Have fun tonight

Alice waves goodbye as he starts the car
EXT SPRINGWOOD - DUSK

Alice walks down an empty street Perhaps too empty to be
right There is a faint SING-SONG NOISE but its not yet
discernible as anything

ALICE

gives a faint look of ominous recognition

ON THE STREET

Alice passes the entrance to the park

INT PARK - ALICES POV

Groups of kids are playing on the swings in the sandbox on
the slide The SING-SONG continues

ALICE

sees something

ALICES POV - PAST THE OTHER CHILDREN

The ELM STREET CHILDREN play their ominous rope games The
SING-SONG becomes identifiable now Its the Elm Street
Childrens Anthem three four better shut the door
ALICE

Her face hardens with resolve

ALICE
No This isnt going to happen

She closes her eyes tight Then opens them again
ALICES POV

Worse now All the normal children are gone Only the Elm
Street Kids remainplaying their endless games

ALICE

grows more determined Heads into the park CAMERA STAYS
WITH HER as she moves with increasing speed

THE ELM STREET CHILDREN
always managing to somehow stay one turn ahead of her
THE PARK

itself has taken on a foreboding darkness The trees cast
oddly elongated shadows
ALICE

has left the path She moves rapidly now through branches
that tear at her clothing and her face Soon she is running
blindly in the direction of the ever present VOICES She
breaks through some bushes and finds herself ina

CLEARING

An open green in the center of the park She is all alone
and the effect even to the color of the grass at her feet
is dreamlike The VOICES have ceased

ALICES POV - IN A 360 PAN

There is nothing but the green common with the trees and
brush all around it

But from somewhere nearby she hears the chanting VOICES
theyve added a new couplet

VOICES
Nine ten Freddys back again

CAMERA CONTINUES IN A SECOND 360

And now where there was foliage a moment ago we see a set of
GOTHIC STEPS framing a SILHOUETTED NUN

ALICE

stares with intrigue as the childrens voices fade

ANGLE ON THE STEPS - LOOKING DOWN

past stone GARGOYLES in the FOREGROUND The nun hurries up
the steps toward CAMERA her face obscured by her habits
veil As the nun moves PAST CAMERA we see Alice at the

bottom of the steps hurrying after her

ALICE
Wait

ANGLE ON ASYLUM DOORS
at the top of the steps as the nun moves inside
ANGLE ON STEPS - FROM INSIDE DOOR

Alice runs up INTO SHOT Stops Glances up at something
high above her

ON THE ASYLUM TOWER

rising toward the sky Immense and imposing Three windows
set in a row at the very top are its only features
REVERSE ANGEL - LOOKING DOWN AT THE STEPS
INT HOSPITAL CONVENT - NIGHT

Completely deserted Alice moves slowly down a seemingly
endless corridor She passes a deserted reception area then
an empty nurses station Open doors lead into frightening
pits of darkness all along the hallway

INTERCUT Alices pensive watchful face with the shadowy
ominous world through which she is walking We just know
that something really nasty is going to happen As she
passes an open doorway she hears a strange animal SOUND
form the room within She pauses looks inside then recoils
with shock as she sees a sheep its mouth all bloody
standing with its lamb near the carcass of a large dead
snake Suddenly she hears the sound of rusty wheels and
whirls around to see

A FREDDYESQUE BABY STROLLER

black ominous looking rusting rolls slowly down the
corridor toward Alice from behind As it moves toward
CAMERA PAN WITH IT TO

ALICE

as she backs against the wall watching the evil pram roll
past Then Alice notices something beyond it far down the
corridor CAMERA follows her gaze to

THE NUN

hurrying SOUNDLESSLY through a doorway We only catch a
glimpse of her as she disappears from view

ALICE
reacts Runs past the stroller towards the nun

THE WHITE OF A NUNS HABIT SWIRLS OUT OF CAMERA to reveal
staircase

SHOOTING FROM OVERHEAD as Alice moves INTO FRAME and starts
up the staircase

ALICES POV

Moving up There is a SQUEAKY ECHO OF WHEELS OFF-SCREEN
ON ALICE FROM BELOW

as she turns to look down

CLOSE ON ALICE

as she looks back up the stairs She takes one step forward
and

WHAM

Shes yanked down OUT OF FRAME

A SET OF DOUBLE DOORS

BANGS open Alice lies on a gurney her head tilted back to
face the CAMERA mounted behind her head The gurney races
down a corridor pushed by a dirty unshaven orderly
BANG

She is pushed through another set of doors into

INT DELIVERY ROOM

WHITE HABITED NURSES AIDES and DOCTORS all crowd around and
peer down at her

ALICE
looks around horrified and confused
A DOCTOR
leans down toward her
DOCTOR
Theres nothing to be afraid of Just do
exactly what I say
ALICE

sits bolt upright on the gurney

ALICE

HER POV PANNING

The crowd of spectatorsorderlies nurses and doctors have
all backed away and now crowd the walls of the room STOP ON
ALICE AMONG THEM AND TRACK INTO CLOSE UP (Alice is still in
hospital gown)

ALICE (IN THE SPECTATORS)

Her eyes lock with

AMANDA KRUEGERS

who is now the one on the gurney about to give birth

AMANDA
Help mewhy is this happening again
Please Dont let him do this

A painful contraction wracks her body

ALICE

tries to understand the meaning of her words

AMANDA

is now lost in the agony of Freddys birth

DOCTOR

Dont panic sister Weve got a breach
birth here Its backwards Im going to

have to turn it around Okay

Deep breath Here we go I need you to

pushnow Push
The birth proceeds

DOCTOR (contd)
Holy shit What is it

A NUN

stands holding something in swaddling (which obscures the

thing from her view She addresses her

NUN

answer to Amanda)

This is still one of Gods creatures you

know Take solace in that

AMANDA

struggles upright on the operating table She is drenched
sweat and clearly terrified She stares directly into the
eyes of the nun holding the swaddled bundle

AMANDA
That is no creature of God

THE NUN

gazes at Amanda shocked by her words
Suddenly the swaddled bundle begins to
furiously The nun fights to keep hold
struggles free from her grasp and falls
a second it scuttles into the shadows
We hear a horrible BRAYING SOUND

THE ORDERLIES

involuntarily step back staring at the
Then general panic sets in

in

She starts to speak

kick and beat

of it but the bundle

under the gurney

thing on the floor

In
AMANDA (contd)
Stop it Give it to me

A few orderlies scramble to close the doors Some bolt
through them racing to get away from the thing on the floor
Bedlam reigns as people shout and rush around

ALICE

watches transfixed Then

BABY FREDDYS POV

streaking towards Alice He scuttled between her legs and
out through the double doors

AMANDA (0S contd)
Dont let it get away

THE DOUBLE DOORS

swing closed PAN to Alice as she gets back to her feet and
turns

ALICES POV

The delivery room is empty

ALICE

turns back to the doors She moves slowly and deliberately
THE DOORS - ALICES POV

CAMERA moves toward them

ALICE

scared but determined She stops in front of them

THE DOORS

HOLD LONG ENOUGH so that were dead sure something evil is
going to jump right into Alices face

ALICE
takes a deep breath and reaches out to open the doors

Nothing awful grabs her Her expression changes to one of
horrified recognition

INT CHURCH - OVER ALICES SHOULDER
where Freddy died in Nightmare Four That horrible BRAYING

SOUND comes from somewhere nearby TRACK WITH HER as she
starts into the church CRANE UP OVER HER to reveal the
church in all its horrid glory full of Freddyized church
artifacts There is no sign of the baby

ALICES POV

moving past row after row of pews There are SLIMY GULPING
NOISES now SOUNDS even more unspeakably unpleasant that the
things BRAYING

The SOUNDS echo in a way that tells Alice nothing about where
theyre coming from The thing could be anywhere

ALICE

aint to happy about that

NEAR THE ALTAR

Freddys fetid remains lie in a crumpled heap We recognize
bits of striped sweater A claw catches a stray bit of light
from somewhere In the distance Alice moves slowly forward

ALICE

stops for a momentstaring at the place she thought she
left her nightmare forever

There is a SLITHERING SOUND from the steps leading to the
altar

ALICE

watches in horror

THE FETAL MONSTER - ALICES POV

now we see this baby Its shape is vaguely human but
with the gleaming skin of a flayed goat It seems to grow as
it moves The thing slithers toward the decaying remains of
Freddys signature outfit All the while its shape is
becoming more loathsomely human

ALICE

Her eyes widen as she realizes what is about to happen

ALICE
You cant make me bring you BACK

THE THING

begins to crawl in through on of Freddys pants legs
ALICE

runs toward the altar

There is an EAR-SPLITTING NOISE OF WOOD BEING RIPPED AWAY
THE ALTAR

rise from the floor The floorboards begin to tilt up toward
Alice as they are torn from their foundation

The angle of the rising floor throws Alice back She looks
at the altar

ALICES POV

It continues to rise preventing her from reaching it
ALICE

can only desperately impotently try to crawl uphill
through the dust and smoke towards the impending
resurrection powerless to prevent it

WE INTERCUT

Alices struggle to reach Freddy before he is resurrected
with

SPLINTERING WOOD SHATTERING GLASS the RISING ALTAR

CLOSE SHOTS of bits and pieces of Freddys metamorphosis seen
through the growing dust of the crumbling church as that
embryonic thing GROWSinto clothesinto the gloveinto
the body

ALICE

struggles but there is no way she can even reach the altar
and God knows what she could do even if she did get there

ONE FINAL CLOSE UP

of Freddys mid-section stretching fully into shape And
then suddenly

The floor falls back into its level position with a dust
raising THUD Alice hits the ground HARD

SILENCE And dust Then

ALICE

raises herself up off the floor Looks around
ALICES POV

Nothing but dust and smoke back-lit by light streaming in
through the broken stained glass windows

ALICE
in BACKGROUND through the smoke asin EXTREME FOREGROUND
CLOSE-UP the charred remains of a hand reconstructing
itself reaches down and slips into the glove

ON ALICE
as she hears the GHASTLY SCRAPING SOUND of Freddys claws
THE ALTAR - ALICES POV

Nothing but the settling dustand somewhere behind it a
figure silhouetted in the shadows

FREDDY EMERGES

standing in front of the pulpit with his arms raised in an
ultimate mockery of the resurrection

He looks even a little more grotesque than usual Misshapen
like the Crooked Man His arms and legs arent quite the
same length The joints are twisted so that nothing in his
body seems aligned Nevertheless he smiles at Alice and
his smiles more malevolent then ever

FREDDY
Its a boy

ALICE

backs away from him frightenedand angry Freddys not in
a very good mood either The two circle each other keeping
their distance

ALICE
You cant come back I locked the door
on you

Freddy laughs a dry rasping cackle Takes a step closer to
her Terrified Alice reflexively strikes out But Freddy
vanishes His chilling laugh echoes around the church walls

Alice follows that laughter with her frightened eyes
searching for him Suddenly

Freddy appears right behind her He slips his arm around her
waist and caresses her tummy with his clawed hand

FREDDY
But I found the key

Alice almost jumps out of her skin She spins around to see
Freddy throw his head back and CACKLEthen a shaft of light
comes through the rear doors of the church Freddy turns

toward it His laughter abruptly dies

Alice faces the doors too
AMANDA KRUEGER

in her nuns habit gazes at them from a room beyond the
doors She is RIMLIT caught in the light streaming from
THREE WINDOWS behind her She points an accusing finger at
Freddy (Amanda speaks in the austere voice of a young
woman though it is the same actress playing Amanda
throughout)

AMANDA
Your birth was a curse on humanity But
the more evil that was in me is no more
I will not allow this to happen again
FREDDY

makes a sound of PURE HATRED as he glares at his mother
Hes almost beside himself with rage as

AMANDA
turns to Alice

AMANDA (contd)
Bring him home

ALICE

starts to move towards Amanda Picks up her pace as she
goes

ALICE
Home How Where

ON AMANDA AND ALICE
as Alice now RUNS toward her

AMANDA
Rid yourself of

But just as Alice is about to reach the doors they SLAM
CLOSED in her face

ALICE

Alice struggles to get the big doors open When she does
she hurries through only to find herself

INT CRAVE INN - NIGHT

walking through the diners front door (Shes back in
her street clothes) The place is empty Too empty Were
certain that Alice is still in her nightmare She looks
around Puzzled Completely freaked out She feels the
counter and furniture checking out the reality of the
place

VOICE (0OS)
(near shout)

Alice damn near jumps out of her skin Spins around Its
ANNE a classmate and co-worker of Alices Shes pretty
pissed off Relieved Alice starts to break down Shes
obviously disturbed and frightened

ALICE

Alice just stands there stunned Anne shakes her head and
moves toward the door

ANNE (contd)

The door slams as Anne goes out Alice reaches for the
telephone

EXT CAMPUS SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

A raucous pool party in full swing People are splashing
around in the water Some dive from pools edge to
cannonball their friends Laughter Chatter And the blare
of loud ROCK MUSIC fills the air Suddenly
A GIRLS BLOODCURDLING SCREAM

rises above the cacophony People scatter to get the hell
out of the way as

YVONNE

leaping off the high-dive plunges like a graceful comet
toward the waters surface Strikes the water where everyone
else used to be

She comes to the surface and swims to the pools edge amid
applause from the others As she climbs from the water
FOLLOW HER through the swirling crowd of partying teens to

DAN AND MARK

Dan sleepily lies in a lounge chair An unopened bottle of
champagne decked with a ribbon rests beside him Mark is
busy sketching in his book -- a big hunk with his arms
around two babes He takes a sip of beer

Greta sits next to them in a gorgeous bikini She reaches
into an ice chest and hands Dan a beer

GRETA
So what did your dad say about you and
Alice going to Europe

Dan passes the beer to Mark who lines it up next to the one
hes already got

DAN
Not much He mostly screamed Thinks

Yvonne towels off herself as she tries to catch up on the
conversation

There is a beat as all ponder this in silence Then Mark
breaks their reverie Grabs Dans champagne

MARK
Screw em Open the champagne Lets

Dan grabs the bottle away
DAN
Hands off squirrel Thats for me and

Alicefor later

Behind them we hear the SOUND of a glass breaking OS
followed by a loud OUCH They turn toward the sound
ANGLE ON POOLS EDGE

One of their classmates clutches his foot in pain then pulls
a piece of broken glass out BLOOD pours out of the wound

ANGLE ON MARK DAN GRETA AND YVONNE

Everyone cringes But Mark really reacts He turns PALE
Closing his eyes tight

MARK
Oh man I couldve gone all night

Faint

Dan shakes his head at Marks sensitivity He closes his
eyes and leans back on the lounge chair as a JOCK approaches
the group Greta pats Mark on the shoulder

GRETA
You can look now its safe

Mark opens his eyes as the Jock leans toward them

JOCK

INT CRAVE INN - NIGHT
Alice talks on the telephone - trying to remain calm

ALICE

She listens Seems to feel a little relief

ALICE (contd)

EXT CAMPUS SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
Mark sits next to Greta showing her his sketchbook Yvonne

pulling Yvonne up a couple inches

YVONNE

Mark turns to Greta with a knowing grin

MARK
Alice beckons

Dan starts to hurry away Mark calls to him
MARK (contd)
Hey Romeo You forgot the secret

Dan stops Mark hefts the champagne Dan grabs it almost
in afterthought and rushes away

MARK (contd)

There he goes the fast man on three

legs
EXT HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Dans truck speeds along a deserted stretch of road
IN THE TRUCK
Dan is at the wheel He looks intense worried about Alice
Hes also very tired The VOICE of an abrasive TALK RADIO DJ

fills the cab We listen to him while Dan fights to keep his
eyes open
DJ (0S)
Right ladyand Elvis killed Marilyn
cause the Kennedys put fluoride in his
water WHATS THE MATTER LADYDID YOU
GO OFF YOUR MEDICATION

He hangs up on her PUSH IN CLOSER and CLOSER on Dan as this
conversation continues

DJ (OS contd)
Jesusis there anyone out there with a
functioning brain that wants to talk to
me
(a beat)
Line twoyoure on the air

Dans eyes close for a second There is an eerie BUZZ and
STATIC from the radio

MRS JORDAN (0S)
Im calling about my wayward ex-son
Daniel who has just acted like on
ungrateful unmanageable Dickweed ever
since he was seduced by this bimbo slut-
whore Alice

Dans eyes open and he stares in shock at the radio which has
transformed itself into a rusting antique

DAN
Mom

Then another voice comes to him through the radio
FREDDY (0S)

If I were you lady Id kill the

ungrateful piggy
THE RADIO
changes from talk show to a BLARINGLY LOUD HEAVY METAL
STATION Less brilliant speed metal masterpiece Fast Track
To Hell fills the car
DAN

stares down at the radio His confusion has given way to
fear

THE SEAT BELTS

snake out to impossible length wrapping around his arms
Dan manages to keep his right hand free but the belts wind
around the rest of his body pinning his left arm uselessly

to his chest

THE TRUCK
crosses over onto the center divider out of control
CLOSE ON GAS AND BRAKE PEDALS

Dan tries to hit the brakes But as his foot comes off the
accelerator the BRAKE PEDAL snakes around and slams down on
top of his foot pushing the accelerator to the floor

DAN

winces in pain Wrenches his left arm free of the belts and
grabs the wheel Desperately reaches with his right for the
GEAR SHIFT which ducks away from his groping hand like a
darting cobra

THE TRUCK

lurches across the center divider and charges into the
oncoming traffic

DAN

hunts wildly for the elusive gear shift Hears a LOUD POP
from inside the cab He looks over

FREDDY

is now sitting in the passenger seat clutching Dans bottle
of champagne His side of the truck is now Freddyized He
takes a huge gulp of champagne Thenspits it out It
hits the dash SIZZLING like ACID More of it runs down his
arm and shoulder Its smoking too He turns to Dan

FREDDY (contd)
Bad year

DAN

some of the drops hit him burning his chest and arms Dan
SCREAMS

FREDDY

His striped jersey begins to smoke as the shoulder socket
melts away Freddy grins Turns to Dan

FREDDY (contd)
Better buckle up

LOW ANGLE ON FREDDY

as he reaches with his left arm and RIPS his right arm off
Then he welds the smoking socket onto the doorjam above the
corner of the passenger window and pulls his on his CLAW
His arm STRETCHES like an extending seatbelt He hooks his
claw into a Freddy buckle at his waist
DAN

has been watching all this in horror Suddenlyhe hears a
loud HONK WHIP PAN with Dan to his POV through the
windshield as the BRIGHT LIGHTS of an approaching truck WHITE
OUT OF FRAME

TRACKING TOWARDS DAN

as he looks down at the gear shift lever

CLOSE ON HIS HAND

slamming the lever into REVERSE

CLOSE ON DANS TRUCK TIRE

skidding on the pavement Burning rubber Starting to melt
as the brakes lock

is slammed headfirst through the windshield Shattering
glass EXPLODES all around him as Dan flies over the hood

EXT CAMPUS SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

CLOSE ON CEMENT AT POOLS EDGE

Dan slams down INTO SHOT bouncing on the hard ground His
lounge chair tumbles after him Dans entire body is
lacerated with small cuts his hair is singed and whats left
of his clothes are tattered smoking shreds

He manages to untangle himself from the overturned chair and
get to his feet Somewhere a telephone is RINGING Thats

what must have awakened him in time to save his life

Dan looks around dazed The pool is empty The party has
broken up Dan turns toward the ringing phone

Behind him is a glassed in cubicleoffice The ringing phone
sits on a desk inside Dan tries the door Locked Then

suddenly comes to his senses in recognition

DAN

Dan turns and charges toward the parking lot
EXT CAMPUS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
DANS TRUCK in the FOREGROUND Beside it sits a gleaming

MOTORCYCLE Dan comes running INTO SHOT searching himself
for his keys Cant find them
He tries to open the trucks door Locked He slams the
hand against it in frustration Then notices the Yamaha

Its key is snugly in the ignition slot like an invitation
Dan hops on the bike Turns the key and kick-starts the
monster The engine jumps to life

AT THE PARKING LOT EXIT

From across the lot we see Dan and bike charging toward us
He roars PAST CAMERA and screeches onto the street

EXT STREET - NIGHT

Dan guns the bikes motor and races toward the Crave-Inn
Suddenly

THE ENGINE

gives a terrific GROWL The bikes front end comes off the
ground as the bike goes into a wheelie then accelerates down
the street at an outrageous speed

DAN

frantically dodges several cars swerving into the oncoming
lane to pass one then careening back to avoid a pair of
looming headlights Dan looks down at the instrument panel
CLOSE ON PANEL

All the gauges are RED LINED

DANS FACE

begins to distort with the G-FORCE of this impossible ride
The bike just keeps increasing speed

THE INSTRUMENT PANEL

goes out of control The gauges swing erratically They
begin to speed up dizzyingly then

THE PANEL EXPLODES

Its cover flies away in shards revealing a frenzied
collection of MOVING WIRES and BLINKING LIGHTS beneath

The wires and lights begin to ungulate in an evolution of
patterns Soon we realize a FACE is beginning to form out of
this tangled sparking mess

THE BIKE

is moving so fast now the other cares are only passing blurs
Dan slaloms through them at an impossible rate
THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
continues to metamorphasize Wires spark and leap as they
wind in and around each other Lights at the top move toward

the center to form two eyes

Shards of sparking metal marshal themselves into two rows of
electric teeth

Other wires form cheekbones lips and the sickeningly
recognizable scar patterns of Freddys skin

And thats just what were looking at
CYBERNETIC FREDDY

His electric eyes stare up at Dans frightened face with the
glee of anticipation He speaks with Mr Jordans voice

FREDDY
Time to feel the need for speed
Dickweed

DAN

stares down at the face in horror Then he sees something
really bad

DANS POV

his right hand clutches the handlebarthrottle Cables feed
out from the brake and throttle grip and PLUNGE INTO HIS HAND
with a smoking SIZZLE attaching him to the machinery His
skin begins to undulate and BUBBLE UP

WHIP PAN

To Dans left hand Cables have melded with his bubbling
flesh there too

CAMERA CRANES DOWN

across the side of the bike where the gas tank is starting
to transform into a hideous living creaturemachine
Distended ribs protrude The gas tanktorso begins to
undulate as it breathes

CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN

toward the cylinders which stretch and begin to breathe
then comes to rest between them and the whirring spokes of
the front wheel Then

CAMERA PANS UP

and we see Dan from below the handlebars Through the
tatters of his shredded clothes we see more cracking
bubbling skin His face is wracked with torture and
something beyond even horror Suddenly

THE HANDLEBARS

now joined completely to Dans hands THRUST DOWNWARD
slamming his chest to the body of the bike Dan stares into
Freddys robotic face now an inch from his own

CAMERA TRACKS

from left to right passing beneath the breathing cylinders
The highway blurs below us The CAMERA emerges on the left
side of the bike looking back toward Dans left leg

THE EXHAUST PIPE

is merging with Dans leg Growing into it as Dans skin
continues to bubble and billow up then peel off

TILT UP TO DANS FACE

and now we realize that Dan has become a MACHINEMAN like a
butterfly emerging from its cocoon

CLOSE ON DANS FACE

Only his eyes remain human Dan struggles continuing to
meld with the machine He opens his mouth forcing the
metallic skin to crack around the edges and begins A LONG
HIDEOUS SCREAM

CAMERA RAPIDLY PULLS BACK

to reveal a FULL SHOT of the FREDDY BIKE hurtling down the
street that has become nothing more than an abstract blur of
movement and light Dans SCREAM continues to build forming

into a plea of terror

DANS HIDEOUS FACE PULLS AWAY as his DISTORTED GROTESQUE
BODY goes flying backwards down a long MEMBRANOUS TUNNEL away
from Alice

He disappears into the depths just as Alice reaches the wall
She stretches out her handand the wall returns to reality

ALICE
is wracked with a SPASM and PAIN She clutches her stomach

and doubles over as though shed been kicked She fights
the pain away Then gets up and runs wildly to the street
EXT CRAVE INN - NIGHT

Alice charges out of the diner Behind her far down the
street we can make out the silhouette of a JACK-KNIFED SEMI
back-lit by the flames and smoke of DANS BURNING TRUCK We
hear the BLARE of a jammed horn

A SERIES OF JUMPCUTS BETWEEN Alices face and her POV END
CLOSE ON HER FACE as she SCREAMS

CAMERA TURNS WITH HER and FOLLOWS HER as she runs panicked
toward it The BLARING horn grows LOUDER

As she nears the semi the drivers door swings violently
open A figure LURCHES from the cab Grabs her as she moves

past The momentum swings them both around

THE TRUCK DRIVER

his bloody face is lit by the burning wreck of Dans truck
His eyes are glazed and shocked He SCREAMS madly into
Alices face

TRUCK DRIVER
He came flying out of nowhere Like he
was a fucking rocket I didnt even see
him

We hear a WALL of approaching SIRENS Alices tear-stained
face is strobed in a flashing red light as she looks past the
semi driver to see Dans mangled body enmeshed in the
wreckage As she tries to get to him his eyes snap open and
he looks straight at her

DAN
It was him

Blood wells from his gaping wounds as he chokes and dies

Her eyes begin to lose focus In a momentAlice collapses

INT HOSPITAL OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT

BLACK Then Alices rim-lit profile moves into frame
Track around to reveal Yvonne working in the background
Continue tracking to reveal that were in an unlit hospital
room What little light there is comes from the glass
observation window in the background

Through the window we can see Alices father conferring with
a DOCTOR Dans parents and TWO POLICE OFFICERS Beyond them
we see traffic in the corridor Alices eyes open suddenly

Alice stares at her as her eyes fill with tears as she
remembers As she starts crying she clutches Yvonne in a
desperate embrace At the sound of her crying Dr Moore and
her father leave Dans parents and approach Yvonne and Alice

ALICE
Dan didnt drink You know that It was

Her father looks away helpless Dr Moore turns to him and
speaks in a confidential professionally calm voice

DR MOORE
These sorts of outbursts arent entirely
uncommon Many women have them in the
first few weeks Especially if theyve
suffered a traumatic shock

(to Alice)
But dont worry young lady youre going

ALICE

(getting increasingly

hysterical)

INT HOSPITAL OBSERVATION ROOM - DAWN
Alice lies in bed apparently asleep The camera pans slowly
around the room It is eerie in here now with the long

shadows of hospital equipment thrown across the walls by the
dimmed hallway lights
The camera continues slowly deliberately to move around the
room until we are on the OPEN doorway STOP

JACOB

a boy of about six or seven years stands there watching

Alice Hes
possessing a

frail Other worldly Not ghost-like but
strange transcendent quality

He wears a white hospital robe and stands without moving

just staring

Alices gaze

at Alice with a transfixed smile of happiness

at the ceiling slowly moves toward the child as

though she were willed by some force to notice him

Shes startled at first by his presence Then she realizes
hes only a boy Even if he is a little odd

compassion

YVONNE

on the counter we push in to reveal she is lost in thought
tears forming in her eyes

Her father comes in carrying a bag of groceries - healthy
stuff veggies chicken fruit Rye Crisp juices As he
comes in Alice covers up her tears and turns away to put the
dinners in the oven He obviously has something to say to
her in mind and the two of them talk simultaneously

that she is holding one of the delicate china dolls in her
hands She stares at it lost in thought Her eyes move to
something at her feet

sits at the head of a massive table hosting one of her
expensively catered dinner parties Though she doesnt look
in the least like Gretas sister the other guests nod and
titter politely

The house is decorated in modern pretentiousness and the
guests match the spirit of the room Greta sits at the
opposite end of the table from her mother wearing a
beautiful white dress

One of the guests turns from Greta to her mother

GUEST
Greta certainly has the perfect body for
modeling You know Eileen Fords a
friend of mine
(to Greta)
I told her about you Shes very
interested

Greta doesnt respond Her mothers delighted

MRS GIBSON
Greta youre being offered the chance of
a lifetime JI think you should show a
little gratitude

GRETA
One of my friends died yesterday mother
DO you mind if I take a few hours off to

remember him

MRS GIBSON
But were having a party dear

She glares at her mother A half-drunk TRENDY GUEST speaks

TRENDY GUEST
I read about him Drunk or something
wasnt he

Mrs Gibson cuts her off trying to damage-control Gretas
association with someone her guests might disapprove of

MRS GIBSON
He was just a friend of Gretas not
someone special not someone she was
seeing you understand Really just an
acquaintance

Another guest speaks up a THIRTYSOMETHING TYPE

THIRTYSOMETHING GUEST
Sad It reminds me of Fitzgerald
Although in his stories its general the
women who have pointless violent deaths

Greta tires to ignore him The other guests jump in with
their own literary allusions and comparisons Greta CLOSES

Catches herself Looks up as

conversing mid-sentence and turn to her Gretas mother

hand about weight-watching

Her mother glances nervously at the other guests Her voice
takes on a shrill edge

MRS GIBSON
But thats why we diet dear So we can
eat at social events and not upset the
other guests

FREDERICK INTRUDES

FREDERICK
Madam if I may

He wheels in a trolley with a sterling silver chafing dish on
it He turns to Greta and pushes in the tray to the hideous
baby chair which Gretas chair has become pinning her in
place

The guests continue chowing down while Mom beams
approvingly Greta stiffens into a parody of too-straight
posture

Frederick removes the lid of the sterling silver chafing dish
with a flourish revealing a perfect miniature doll-like
replica of Greta

With a flourish he proceeds to slit it open filleting it in
front of Gretas horrified eyes with one of the blades on
Freddys clawed hand

Frederick has now become Freddy transforming from the normal
Robert Englund to Freddy Krueger

At the end of the blades on Freddys claw a sharpened silver
spoon now exists

He scoops into the dissected doll and begins to feed Greta
forcing some of the mush into her mouth Greta resists
turning her head to spit it out

Freddy jerks her head back to the front

GRETAS POV

as her head is snapped back Another clawspoonful of mush
in her face

FREDDY
You are what you eat

The table guests laugh and feast on in the background

MRS GIBSON
Nothing but the best for Greta

FREDDY
(with another spoonful
Second helping

The guests laugh as Greta struggles helplessly moaning and
groaning her objections
MRS GIBSON
Dont talk with your mouth full dear

GRETA

stares at the clawsscoop wide-eyed as they force the MUSH
into her mouth

GRETAS POV
as Freddy shoves another spoonful

FREDDY
Dont forget dessert

GUEST
A rare delicacy

WIDER

to reveal what Freddy is feeding her He stands over Greta
scooping his claws into her TORSO as though it were made of
ice cream and delivering the stuff back up to her mouth

GRETA

screams in horror as she realizes what shes eating
INT ALICES KITCHEN - NIGHT

OVER ALICES SHOULDER

As she steps to the refrigerator and grasps the door handle
we get a glimpse of something foreboding a split second
before she opens the doora Freddy magnet above the handle
that says DIE BITCH

Alice pulls the door open PUSH IN past her to the groceries
inside a real Freddy food feast of graveyard leftovers --
flies swarm when Alice opens the door Maggots rot and
cobwebs Dripping fetid garbage Then suddenly

Gretas hideously mutated face SHOOTS INTO CLOSE UP from
RIGHT FRAME Her cheeks have been horribly distended Food
spills from her mouth as she tries to scream

refrigerator door Her arms desperately reach out towards

IN THE DREAM - FREDDY AND GRETA

Freddy shoves another clawful of stuff into Gretas mouth
She starts to CHOKE

Freddy pulls Greta to him Hugs her patting her back like
a parent burping an infant Hes almost cradling her as she
continues to choke the life out of herself
Freddys patting becomes harder Greta jolts under each
slap on the back

IN THE DINNER PARTY - ON GRETA - FROM BELOW SHOOTING UP
She starts to choke Her face goes blue She stands

light that spills from beneath the big half open delivery
door Across the door we see GREY and SON CONSTRUCTION

The and SON has been recently added Alice and Yvonne still
in her nurses uniform approach

INT GREYS CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

A huge warehouse and commercial shop Rows of scaffolding
filled with prefab door and wall units recede into the
darkness

A glass partitioned office fills a corner near the door We
can see Marks father moving around inside of it Alice and
Yvonne enter and move toward the office door

ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR

Alice and Yvonne peer inside Mr Grey dressed in workmans
clothes is stoically trying to repair a broken name-plate
We can tell that one of the two desks in here was intended
for Mark Alice looks around concerned

ALICE
Mr Greyis Mark around

He looks up very upset Nods Angrily gestures toward the
labyrinth of racks

MR GREY
Back there somewhere
IN THE RACKS OF THE SCAFFOLDING

The rays of a single worklight high on the back of the wall
stab like fingers through the maze of scaffolding
Silhouetted against them Mark slowly glides between the
racks on a skateboard a solitary and forlorn figure

Alice and Yvonne enter shot backs to CAMERA watching him

ALICE
(tentatively)
Mark are you okay

MARK
Yeah Im just aces

Looks like hes not Mark ignores them as Alice and Yvonne
move closer Hes a tightly wound coil ready to snap

ALICE
I want to talk to both you guys about
Greta And

MARK

(snapping)

Im very fucking sorry but Greta is dead
today Could we interest you in someone

else

Alice steps closer to him her empathy allowing her to ignore
his tone of voice

YVONNE
It was just an accident Like with Dan

ALICE
No accident I tried to warn all of you
about Krueger

Yvonne shakes her head Not wishing Alice to indulge her
fantasies

YVONNE
Please Alice

But Alices words have left an effect on Mark He brings his
skateboard to a halt Gives her a direct look

MARK
I thought about that

ALICE
She mustve fallen asleep at the table

YVONNE
Stop it Alice Just stop it Stick to
the facts

Mark glances at her

MARK
Too bad

He goes back to Alice

ALICE
(frustrated)
I dont understand whats happening
Krueger has to use my dreams but he got
to Dan and Greta while I was awake
Hows he doing it

YVONNE
(sharply)
Why dont you two stick to reality

Mark turns his displaced anger on her full force

MARK
Why dont you shut up and let her talk
Two of us died in the last two days does
that strike you as particularly normal

YVONNE
Mark

MARK
Im not finished - I loved Greta A lot
And if maybe just maybe someone or some
thing killed her Id like to hear about

YVONNE
I cant listen to this

She starts to turn away Mark gets angry again Shouts

Alice doesnt like the implications of that at all She
reaches out to lead Jacob away

ALICE

Alice starts off again Yvonne really looks worried now

YVONNE

ALICE

I just cant figure out how hes getting

Suddenly a thought strikes her She wheels on Yvonne

ALICE (contd)
Do unborn babies dream

Yvonne hesitates afraid her answer might feed Alices
fantasies

YVONNE
Yeahthey do butdo us both a
favordont mention any of this to Dr
Moore

INT DR MOORES OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Yvonne adjusts the ULTRA SOUND MONITOR Dr Moore finishes
his pre-examination of Alice He is extremely irritated

DR MOORE
Developing fetuses can spend up to
seventy-percent of their day in what we
call dream state More as they mature

Yvonne shoots a frustrated look at Alice

ALICE
Would I be able to sense them

DR MOORE
(annoyed)
Is that why youre here To see if your
babys having nightmares

ALICE
Were here to find out everything we can
arent we

DR MOORE
Frankly Ive found nothing about you
that would indicate the necessity of
ultra-sound at this stage of your
pregnancy

Dr Moore throws a dark look at Yvonne

ALICE
I just want to make sure my babys all
right

Yvonne hands the ultra-sound device to Dr Moore He runs
the device over Alices baby

THE ULTRA-SOUND MONITOR

The screen comes on with a BLIP A barely distinguishable
black and white image appears

DR MOORE (0OS)
The heart seems strong Lets hear it

Yvonne flicks a switch and a steady RHYTHMIC BEAT begins on
the TRACK coming from a speaker above the monitor

Alice watches the screen fascinated Suddenly The
picture begins to shift and distort with electronic spasms
The SOUND of the babys heartbeat begins to grow LOUDER and
SURREAL

Alice turns apprehensively to Yvonne and Dr Moore who are
oblivious to any of this Then

The wall behind Alice starts to PULSATEbecome FLESHLIKE
It ripples blue-red with veins Thena gaping hole opens

and we are staring into the fetal canal

WHOOSH
Alice is sucked through the opening
AN IRIDESCENT BEAM OF LIGHT (ALICE)

flies through a landscape of pulsing blood vessels and living
tissue We are inside Alices body

AN ENORMOUS VALVE

stretches open and the beam of light shoots through it
then drops down OUT OF FRAME Hold a beat

Then Alice floats up INTO FRAMEa translucent figure
ethereal She is caught in a GLOW OF LIGHT WE TURN WITH
HER to see

from the uterine wall

FREDDY KRUEGER

smiling at Alice

FREDDY
Hi See a family resemblance

ALICE

reacts in fear as she sees

THE UMBILICAL CHORD

beginning to bulge as something forces its way through it
toward her baby

The bulge moves down the chord then a second one enters from
the wallboth things travel toward the fetus belly like
golf balls moving through a python Then

WHOOSH WHOOSH they shoot into the fetus

FREDDYS HUGE FACE

leering in twisted pleasure
THE BABYS FACE

begins to slowly transform into a mask of fear and pain Its
eyes begin to flutter

ON FREDDY

As he realizes the child is on the verge of awakening He
grimaces in anger and frustration

ALICE
screams at Freddy

ALICE

Yvonne shoots a look at Dr Moore She realizes shed better
get Alice out of there before he has her committed Yvonne
moves to Alice

YVONNE
Come on sweety Ill take you home
Youll feel better after you get some
real sleep

Yvonne manages to guide Alice from the room Dr Moore
watches them leave Then he checks something in Alices
file Picks up the telephone and dials a number

INT ALICES BEDROOM - DAY

Alice ENTERS carrying two mugs of coffee and speaking in a
frantic rush Yvonne follows behind a look of deep concern
on her face

ALICE
-Dan was there Greta too Krueger

to Jacob

She hands one of the cups to Yvonne who tries to get her
attention

YVONNE
Alice

Yvonne sets her mug down and gently places her hands on
Alices shoulders adopting a very reasonable tone

YVONNE (contd)
Alice I want you to stop and listen to
yourself Do you know how you sound

Alice nods Calmly replies

ALICE
Completely insane But Im not
(pause)
And if youre my friend youll try to
believe me a little

Yvonne looks into Alices eyes We see that she really cares
about her and that Alice is starting to scare her

YVONNE
I am your friend and Im worried sick
about you But youre like a locked
safe Youve gotta start dealing with
reality

ALICE
Krueger is reality
YVONNE
(voice rising)
And so is your baby Youve got more
than just yourself to think of now

ALICE

(getting angry)
What do you think Im doing

(pauses)
Look Whether you believe it or not
Krueger is back Hes after the baby and
if I dont try to do something about it
who will

Suddenly the door is pushed open and Mark enters carrying a
folder stuffed with xeroxed newspaper clippings He looks
from Alice to Yvonne and back

YVONNE
(continuing the discussion)
All I know is that you are not doing
yourself or the baby any good by acting
like a crazy woman Why dont you take
off - leave Springwood and cool out
somewhere for a while

ALICE
Goddamn it Yvonne You dont just run
away from this guy He finds you in your
dreams

MARK
(looking at Yvonne)
He sure found a few others before us

Yvonne looks at him with frustration

YVONNE
You too

MARK
He invited me to his house last night

Yvonne ruefully shakes her head Tries the calm approach
YVONNE
Lookwere all tired None of us had

any sleep since Friday night

ALICE
Thats the only reason youre alive

Yvonne abandons the calm approach Wheels on Alice
YVONNE

(shouting)
No its not
She turns for the door Mark shoves the folder towards her

MARK
Yvonne look through this stuff Shes
not crazy

Yvonne knocks the folder from Marks hand scattering its
contents everywhere Then she storms out slamming the door
behind her The xeroxed clippings float to the floor Mark
glances at Alice

MARK (contd)
You okay

Alice nods They start picking up the scattered clippings
ALICE
I found out how Kruegers been doing it
while Im awake Hes using Jacobs
dreams Weve got to stop him

Mark looks up at her

MARK
You know there isone way

Alice looks up at him intrigued
MARK (contd)
Have you thought about not having the
baby I mean no baby no babys dreams
Alice thinks about it very hard Finally shakes her head
ALICE
I couldnt do that Mark Hes my last
link with DanNo I want him
MARK
(nods smiling)
Then well find another way
ALICE
leans down again and continues picking up the clippings

INT ALICES LIVING ROOM

Alice comes down the stairs Her father is sitting in the

Mrs Jordan smiles at Alice a little too sweetly We see the
strain of her sons death in her eyes

MRS JORDAN
AliceMr Jordan and I wanted to see
how you were feeling Come sit down

Alice hesitates this is the last thing she needs right now

ALICES DAD
This isnt really a good time Maybe if

Mrs Jordan nervously cuts him off

MRS JORDAN
Frankly dear we wondered what you
intend to do with our baby

ALICE
What I what Well Ive thought about

Mrs Jordan glances at her husband He uncomfortably shifts
in his chair then reluctantly speaks up

MR JORDAN
Were concerned that this all might be a
little too much for youI mean being
single and well everything

His voice trails off His wife frowns at his lack of
fortitude She jumps in

MRS JORDAN
What Mr Jordan means is that were aware
of the burden that raising a child would
place you

Alice continues to stare at her not quite sure where this is
going Mark quietly appears on the stairs behind her holding
the folder of clippings

MRS JORDAN (contd)
Were offering to helpadopt it and
raise it as though it were --

ALICE
Look I appreciate what youre offering
but no He is my responsibility

MRS JORDAN
(getting adamant)
And ours Its our grandchild

Mr Jordan clearly uncomfortable tries to cut her off

MR JORDAN
Doris maybe this wasnt such a good --

She ignores him getting more forceful

MRS JORDAN
In your present condition Alice were
worried about your ability --

ALICE
What are you talking about My
condition

Alices father gives Mrs Jordan a dark look Surprised

MR JORDAN
We had a call from Dr Moore He said
Alice was hysterical That shes been
having paranoid delusions and

ALICE
You dont understand

MRS JORDAN
We know youve been through a lot but
theres more than your feelings at stake
here

ALICE
Youre not taking my baby

Mrs Jordan stands losing her composure

MRS JORDAN
The courts may not agree with you

Alices father stands Turns an angry gaze on Mrs Jordan

ALICES DAD

jumps stunned He blinks did that really happen Then he
grabs his mug of coffee and takes a long drink

PUSH FOCUS FULL SCREEN

PROWLER Suddenly

A HUGE HAND holding a PENCIL comes INTO FRAME and continues

filled with an artists concentration He glances OFF

asleep in his bed TRACK IN CLOSE on her face until the dark
wall behind her becomes the corridor in the asylum She
opens her eyes and sits up CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she stands
and moves down the corridor

Alice moves down the corridor away from CAMERA searching
for Amanda Comes to a corner Turns down it

INT MARKS ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a spread of PHANTOM PROWLER sketches lying on the
floor CAMERA TRACKS across them following a TRAIL OF
SKETCHES that lead to the far side of the room where we find
Mark lying on the floor at the base of a rack of comic laden
shelves propped up on one elbow bored flicking through yet
another comic

TRACK AROUND MARK to reveal Alice still asleep on the bed
INT ASYLUM CORRIDOR

A long arched Gothic corridor lit by pools of light At
the far end we see a staircase silhouetted by a
rainspattered window behind it The stairs lead up into the

shadows

ALICE (0S)
Amanda I need to talk to you

ALICE walks past CAMERA INTO SHOT and pauses Sees the
staircase starts hurrying for it

AT THE STAIRCASE

Alice glances toward the top Instead of leading to a
doorway the stairs dead-end against a BRICK WALL She
climbs the stairs to the bricked up doorway at the top

Laying her head on the wall pressing her hands to it she
murmurs
ALICE (contd)
(to herself)
Found you

Suddenly from behind

FREDDY (0S)
Where you goin piglet

Alice turns toward the voice

FREDDY (contd)
The partys just starting

ON ALICE

She starts rolling across the wall As we pull back the
camera turns on its axis to reveal that Freddy has adjusted
things The set is now tilted on a different axis Alice is
rolling away from the camera down the staircase but on the
wall not the stairs

Suddenly a RUSTING METAL DOOR is revealed in the wall down
which she rolls She rolls into it and crash lands in the

nightmare jacuzzi room

Freddy slowly rises from the boiling jacuzzi until he stands
on the surface of the pool grinning smugly

Alice climbs to her feet warily

FREDDY

plunges his arm beneath the surface and yanks Yvonne up by
the hair She sputters and chokes gasping for air Freddy

laughs

FREDDY (contd)
Look what I found

ALICE

is taken by surprise Steels herself

AT THE STAIRCASE

Alice glances toward the top Instead of leading to a
doorway the stairs dead-end against a BRICK WALL She

climbs the stairs to the bricked up doorway at the top

Laying her head on the wall pressing her hands to it she
murmurs

ALICE
(to herself)
Found you
Suddenly a door slams Alice startled looks But before
she can react she is swept off her feet

Alice starts rolling across the wall As we pull back the

camera turns on its axis to reveal that Freddy has adjusted
things The set is now tilted on a different axis and Alice
is rolling away from the camera down the staircase but on

the wall not the stairs

Suddenly a RUSTING METAL DOOR is revealed in the wall down
which she rolls She rolls into it and into the bloody
jacuzzi room She grabs a hanging chain but cant hang on

She drops into the murky water She slowly turns with utter
distaste

FREDDY
Where you goin piglet The partys

just starting

Alice startled quickly regains her composure

ALICE
I know exactly what youre up to
Krueger

FREDDY
Gee Alice I thought I was up
toYvonne

He plunges his arm beneath the surface and yanks Yvonne up by
the hair She sputters and chokes gasping for air Freddy
laughs Alice is taken by surprise She steels herself

ALICE
Let her go

Freddy cackles and dunks Yvonne savagely

FREDDY
Going once Going twice

FREDDY AND YVONNE

he hoists her closer until their faces are an inch apart
he licks Yvonnes cheek She doesnt know whether to scream
or throw up Then Freddy slowly runs a CLAW across her
breasts leaving a thin trail of blood

Alice circles Freddy until she is on the opposite side from
Yvonne

ALICE
Im the A the L the ice Were
three together

Yvonnes eyes swivel to Alice in recognition As Alice
speaks she grabs a jacuzzipool instrument (a skimmer a
harpoon-shaped window hook)

ALICE AND YVONNE
And thats the way its gonna be

and as they speak she flails Freddy across the stomach
while Yvonne executes a backflip (as previously seen in her
diving sequence) out of Freddys grasp and on to dry land

Freddy staggers back and disappears into the jacuzzi

Alice and Yvonne run back into the asylum and SLAM the door
behind them on the now empty jacuzzi

We cut back inside the jacuzzi to see Freddys hand emerge
and pull under his still-bobbing hat

YVONNE AND ALICE

sprawled on the corridor floor where they landed Yvonne
turns to Alice they throw their arms around each other

ALICE
Are you alright

YVONNE
(nods collecting herself
YeahSo thats him And youre not
crazy

Alice and Yvonne share a weary rueful smile Alice pulls
Yvonne to her feet

ALICE
Weve got to find Amanda Shes the key

Mark lays on the floor still propped up on one elbow
reading the comic Bored he pushes it away Notices on
nearby which he hasnt seen before Pulls it over

THE COMICS COVER

scratch as though it were tearing the cover open Written
across the top in dripping letters is the title NIGHTMARE ON
YOUR STREET

MARK

intrigued rolls hover on his stomach and opens the comic
with both hands His expression changes as he sees

IN THE COMIC
drawn in black and white a comic book style representation
of Gretas death sequence

MARK

begins to flip back through the comic book INTERCUT his
horrified reactions with

THE COMIC BOOK

already caused Dans death and Yvonnes dive

MARK
You shitty son of a bitch

There is a drawing of him lying on the floor reading a
comic book The drawing is followed by several BLANK FRAMES

MARK

stares a moment touches the first empty frame then he TURNS
A LINE DRAWING and begins to UNRAVEL into the COMIC BOOK

BLACK AND WHITE

a whirlwind of black and white comics swirl round and round
slowly abating to reveal

MARK

in COLOR backed against a wall of BLACK AND WHITE Freddyized
scaffolding (Mark will be the only thing in color
throughout the sequence) He looks around amazed

PULL BACK to reveal hes standing in a corner made by two
walls of scaffolding They tower above him rusting
decrepit held together at odd angles -- a nightmarish cross
between Marks comic-stuffed racks and the ones in his
fathers workshop

Mark looks around frightened Starts climbing his way up
and out Freezes when he hearsRIP

Mark looks through the scaffolding and sees
FREDDY

on the other side ripping through the scaffolding supports
as though they were made of paper cutting his way to Mark

FREDDY
Time to cut another character out of the
story

MARK
eyes going wide He jumps down Turns around Sees the
towering walls of scaffolding stretching ahead of him to
seeming infinity He races away

ANGLE ON MARK

running away from CAMERA down an enormous CANYON OF
FREDDYIZED RACKS

THE CANYON OF RACKS - DOWN ANGLE

Looking down from far above we see Mark frantically racing
through the canyon Freddy steps into the canyon behind him
Long shadows stretch out before them

MARK

slides to a halt as he comes face to face with A DEAD END
No way out He turns as he hears FREDDYS CACKLE

BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY
laughs as he reaches out and grabs the scaffolding on either
side of him His fingers and claws plunge through the paper
racks Freddy cackles with laughter then starts racing like
a missile toward Mark

BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY - SIDE ANGLE

TRACKING with Freddy as he rushes down the aisle riding a
SKATEBOARD ripping and tearing through the rack supports

ANGLE ON MARK

at the dead end CAMERA RACES right toward him He raises
his arms against the impending collision

THROUGH MARKS HANDS

as we see BLACK AND WHITE FREDDYs leering face loom right
into CAMERA about to CRASH right into MARK Then

ON MARK

Freddys gone Mark lowers his arms amazed and relieved
But his relief evaporates as CAMERA QUICKLY TRACKS AROUND and
we see the scaffolding begin to collapse from the far end of
the canyon forward falling like dominoes toward us

ON MARK - DOWN ANGLE

as ton after ton of scaffolding and shelves crash down around
him trapping him at the dead end corner

MARK

looks at all the destruction around him Suddenly SPLAT
Something red drips onto him from above He looks up
ON THE SCAFFOLDING BEHIND MARK - LOW ANGLE

The shelves that were stuffed with comics a second ago have
become a WALL OF DOLLS everything from BARBIES to RAGGEDY
ANNS

Then about halfway up BandW FREDDY steps into view dragging
a GRETA DOLL IN A HIGH CHAIR with him (They are the same
size as the other dolls around them)

Gretas porcelain face and stomach bear large cracks through
which an evil soupy RED goop oozes out She stares
imploringly at Mark Speaks through cracked lips

GRETA
Markhelp me

MARK

stares up at her horrified
FREDDY AND GRETA

Freddy teasingly scoops his clawed finger into Gretas torso
Lovingly licks her red goop off the end of his claw

FREDDY
Is she delicious or am I crazy Try a
bite

He laughs Then gives her a shove The high chair tilts
forward then topples off the scaffolding

MARK
screams in frustration and rage

MARK
No

He glares menacingly at Freddy as he raises two FUTURISTIC
PISTOLS Aims point blank into Kruegers chest and starts
blasting away

holes being hammered into him The impact knocks Freddy to

the pieces of paper reassemble filling the empty frames of
the book with the illustrated version of Marks death

PULL BACK from the comic and we see Mark lying on the floor
next to it CRUSHED TO DEATH beneath a section of his
collapsed shelving The COLOR that drained from the PHANTOM
PROWLER is now a growing pool of Marks own blood

CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK and we see the rest of his room
is unharmed except for a single set of shelves near Mark
that teeter dangerously

In the BACKGROUND Alice lies on the bed still sleeping But

Only you can help her now Jacob

With a snarl of anger as if dismissing the thought Jacob
bounds up the bridge toward the struggling couple

nasty evil expression on his face

is becoming more like Freddy

Lets go I want to learn stuff from you

Will you teach me

Freddy at first looks suspicious then smiles and extricates
himself from Alice who is looking at Jacob in horror Freddy
gives her an obscene kiss as he separates from her She
sinks to the ground exhausted and beaten

Freddy approaches Jacob who smiles evilly Suddenly Freddy
stops He snarls as he sees something behind Jacob

Jacob turns and sees Amanda far above silhouetted in the

given you

Jacob turns back and looks at Freddy

Fuck you Krueger

As he speaks his mouth grows larger impossibly large A
violent wind appears to be rushing from him

Finally with a roar the decrepit souls of DAN GRETA and
MARK rush from him and hurl themselves upon Freddy The
ectoplasmic trio strike Freddy full in the chest ripping
through him and emerging from his back As they doe so they
pull him backwards towards Amanda

The Freddy Fetus emerging from a steaming pile of ectoplasm
malevolently glaring at Amanda

ON ALICE

As she sees the new BABY JACOB emerging from his pile of
clothes on the floor she rushes to him and picks him up
cradling him tenderly in her arms

ON AMANDA

who seizes the Freddy Fetus and holds it to her

AMANDA (contd)
I forgive you my son

INTERCUT

as the two mothers simultaneously merge with their off-
spring

Amanda shudders in silent agony as she accepts her son back
inside her

As Alice receives Jacob an optical effect surrounds them as
he is absorbed The effect coalesces into a single column of
light which drives upwards finally fading as the souls of
Dan Mark and Greta take their leave
Alice looks across at Amanda and starts towards her
instinctively Amanda is now silhouetted again in the
doorway to the room of the maniacs

AMANDA (contd)
Dont come near Take your son and
leave

ON AMANDA

Sadly she turns to leave We think the fight is over when
suddenly grotesquely appearing from her back Freddys arm
shoots out Amanda gasps and clutches the doorway As a
look of determination crosses her face the arm is sucked
back inside

A muffled howl of anguish echoes around as she steps through
the doorway into the room of 100 maniacs The SOUND of the
maniacs rises to a crescendo

A SERIES OF DOORS

starting with the one in front of Amanda slam shut one
after the next until the final door - right in front of Alice
SLAMS CLOSED BLOCKING HER OFF FOREVER FROM AMANDA

We hear the echo of that final SLAM then SILENCE

ALICE

stands there staring at the last door The SOUNDS OF A
CRYING INFANT COME UP ON THE TRACK

EXT PARK - DAY

Bucolic Sunny Serene A picnic table rests beneath the
shade of a tree in MIDDLE FOREGROUND Beyond it children
romp and play The infants CRYING grows LOUDER as

A BABYS ARM moves into EXTREME FOREGROUND and stops Two
female arms reach in and lift a CRYING cherubic infant
Follow the arms up to Alice as she tenderly cradles JACOB
Yvonne steps INTO SHOT admiring the baby

YVONNE
You do good work Alice

ALICE
So did Dan

CAMERA TRACKS as they move to the picnic table Alice gently
shushes and rocks Jacob who quiets down

YVONNE
He sure loves to stay awake

ALICE
Thats okay Hes got the rest of his
life to catch up on his sleep

Jacob closes his eyes safely ensconced in his mothers arms
and drifts off to sleep

ALICE (contd)
Sweet dreams Jacob Daniel

SLOWLY DOLLY BACK - SLOW MOTION

as a JUMP ROPE held by someone OFF SCREEN arcs over the top
of CAMERA moving down through the frame with a WHOOSH And
again WHOOSH And again

Then the back of a CHILDS HEAD very white and soft focused
bobs INTO BOTTOM FRAME as the rope comes down over the lens
one more time and we

FADE OUT
