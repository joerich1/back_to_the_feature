Sabrina 1 The Larrabees
EXT LARRABEE ESTATE - EVENING

NARRATOR Once upon a time on the North Shore of Long Island
some 30 miles from New York there lived a small girl on
a large estate The estate was very large indeed and had
many servants There were gardeners to take care of the
gardens and a tree surgeon on a retainer There was a
boatman to put the boats in the water in the spring and
scrape their bottoms in the winter There were specialists
to take care of the grounds the outdoor tennis court and
the indoor tennis court the outdoor swimming pool and the
indoor swimming pool And aman of no particular title
took care of a small pool in the garden for a goldfish

named George

Also on the estate there was a chauffeur by the name
of Fairchild who had been imported from England years
ago together with a new Rolls-Royce Fairchild was a
fine chauffeur of considerable polish like the eight
cars in his care And he had a daughter by the name of

Sabrina

It was the eve of the annual six-meter-yacht races
and as had been traditional on Long Island for the past
30 years the Larrabees were giving a party It never
rained on the night of the Larrabee party The Larrabees

wouldnt have stood for it

INT LARRABEE MANSION - EVENING
NARRATOR There were four Larrabees in all — father mother and
two sons Maude and Oliver Larrabee were married in 1906
and among their many wedding presents was a town house

in New York and this estate for weekends

The town house has since been converted into Saks Fifth
Avenue Linus Larrabee the elder son graduated from
Yale where his classmates voted him the man most likely
to leave his alma mater 50 million dollars His brother
David went through several of the best Eastern colleges
for short periods of time and through several marriages
for even shorter periods of time He is now a successful
six-goal polo player and is listed on Linuss tax return
as a 600-dollar deduction Life was pleasant among the
Larrabees for this was as close to heaven as one could

get on Long Island

EXT LARRABEE BUILDING - DAY

holding a newspaper

INT LARRABEE OFFICE - DAY

David walks into the secretarial office

DAVID Is he in Is my brother in
McCARDLE Yes Mr David but hes very busy

DAVID I want to see him
McCARDLE Well how about uh 330 this afternoon
DAVID I want to see him now

McCARDLE Im sorry I have my orders Hes working with the
lawyers on the plastics deal

DAVID Miss McCardle are you going to press that button or
Ill break that door down using you as a battering ram

McCARDLE Mr David

DAVID Make up your mind

Miss McCardle pushes the button opening the door Inside Linus

is talking with a number of lawyers

Im really steamed

LINUS All right gentlemen Ill be ten minutes

DAVID How did this get in the paper

LINUS What

DAVID It looks like wedding bells for David Larrabee again
The girl is Elizabeth Tyson of the Oyster Bay Tysons

LINUS Well congratulations

DAVID Did you plant this

LINUS Me I thought it was common knowledge about you and
Elizabeth Tyson You like her dont you

DAVID I like her a lot

LINUS Well

DAVID 1 like a lot of girls a lot

LINUS You can say that again

DAVID

What are you gonna do with that gun

Linus shoots several times into a barrel

DAVID
LINUS

McCARDLE
DAVID
LINUS
DAVID

Put that thing away Linus

Look at that The greatest plastic ever made Not
a scratch on it Say I wonder how this would stand up
against a bazooka Miss McCardle ask General Stanton
on Governors Island and ask if we can borrow a bazooka

Yes Mr Larrabee

To get back to my problem if you dont mind

Lend me your lighter

Get this straight Linus I have no intention of

marrying Elizabeth Tyson

Linus holds a lighter under the plastic shield

LINUS

DAVID

LINUS

DAVID

LINUS

DAVID

LINUS
DAVID

LINUS

Doesnt burn doesnt scorch doesnt melt How about
that

Look Linus Ive been married before Ive had it

Ive had it three times

Yeah but this is the first time the family approves
because for once youre gonna settle down and do something
constructive Taste it

Whats so constructive about marrying Elizabeth Tyson

Taste it

Its sweet

Thats right Its made of sugar cane

Sugar cane Waitaminute This wouldnt have anything
to do with the fact the Tysons own the largest holdings of
sugar cane in Puerto Rico would it

Second largest The largest have no daughter

Linus slides the plastic shield back into the barrel

DAVID

Its all beginning to make sense Mr Tyson owns the

sugar cane You own the formula for the plastics and Im
supposed to be offered up as a human sacrifice on the
altar of industrial progress Is that it

LINUS You make it sound so vulgar David As if the son of
the hot-dog dynasty were being offered in marriage to the
daughter of the mustard king Surely surely you dont
object to Elizabeth just because her father happens to

have 20 million dollars Thats very narrow-minded of

you David
DAVID Just one thing you overlooked I havent proposed
and she hasnt accepted
LINUS Oh dont worry I proposed and Mr Tyson accepted
DAVID Did you kiss him
LINUS Now look David Elizabeth is one of the loveliest

girls around Sooner or later youre gonna propose to

her anyway Im only trying to help you make up your

mind
DAVID Then why dont you marry her
LINUS Me
DAVID Well whats so funny You want to die an old maid
LINUS Well I was just thinking that if I were able to get

married Id have to take a Dictaphone two secretaries
and four corporation counselors along on the honeymoon
Id be unfaithful to my wife every night of my married

life with vice presidents boards of directors slide-rule
accountants This this is my home No wife would

ever understand it

DAVID Well neither can I Youve got all the money in the
world
LINUS Well whats money got to do with it If making money

were all there was to business itd hardly be worth while

going to the office Money is a by-product

DAVID Well whats the main objective Power
LINUS Ah Thats become a dirty word
DAVID Well then whats the urge Youre going into plastics

now What will that prove

LINUS Prove Nothing much A new product has been found
something of use to the world A new industry moves into
an undeveloped area Factories go up Machines are brought
in A harbor is dug and youre in business Its purely
coincidental of course that people whove never seen a
dime before suddenly have a dollar And barefooted kids
wear shoes and have their teeth fixed and their faces washed
Whats wrong with a kind of an urge that gives people
libraries hospitals baseball diamonds and uh movies

on a Saturday night Miss McCardle will you send in the

secretaries
McCARDLE Yes Mr Larrabee
DAVID Now you make me feel like a heel If I dont marry

Elizabeth some kids gonna be running around Puerto Rico
barefoot with cavities in his teeth

LINUS Here Look at this stuff Youll fly in a plane made
of it Youll wear a suit made of it and before were
through with it youll probably be able to eat it
Were organizing Larrabee Plastics Larrabee Construction
is ready with the blueprints Larrabee Shipping bought
nine more freighters to handle the traffic

DAVID You mean the wheels are in motion already

LINUS Thats exactly what I mean

A number of secretaries walk into the room

LINUS Now would you mind demonstrating the weight test to
Mr David please

DAVID Oh Linus Ill take your word for it

LINUS Up you go

DAVID Now wait a minute

LINUS I want you to see how resilient it is Bounce please
ladies

The secretaries bounce up and down

LINUS Some plastic eh Were planning on a summer wedding
so we can get in on this years sugar crop

DAVID

Im telling you Linus this boy should be drummed out
of the family

What have I done now Father

Now Im not saying that all Larrabees have been saints
There was a Thomas Larrabee who was hung for piracy and
there was a Benjamin Larrabee who was a slave trader and
there was my great-great-uncle Joshua Larrabee who was
shot in Indiana while attempting to rob a train But there
never was a Larrabee who behaved as David Larrabee has
behaved here tonight

Exactly what have I done

What have you done

Father remember your basal metabolism

No gentleman makes love to a servant in your mothers
house

She is not a servant

Shes a servants daughter And in behaving as you
have youve embarrassed not only your mother but also
our chauffeur I have too much respect for Fairchild
never to intrude on his personal life and I expect you
to have the same respect for his daughter

I have so much respect for his daughter I invited

her to the party

OLIVER Thats overdoing it

DAVID I love her

OLIVER He loves her Next thing we know hell lean a ladder
up against the garage wall and elope with the girl in the
middle of the night

DAVID Maybe

OLIVER Ill overlook for the moment the fact that youre an
engaged man and merely remind you of your marital record
to date

DAVID I know Father Ive made three mistakes

OLIVER First that Hungarian countess who only married you to

bring her family over A mother a father and five brothers

All of them badly in need of costly dental repairs

DAVID Do we have to go through that again

OLIVER Then that Twyman girl Her family 50 years on the Social
Register and she has the audacity to wear on her wedding
dress not a corsage bu bu but a Stevenson button

LINUS Father you promised not to swear

OLIVER Th Th then that great actress Turns out all she does
is commercials on television for an underarm deodorant

Poof poof poof poof And now our chauffeurs daughter

DAVID Father are you through Because theres someone
waiting

OLIVER Iam not through And Im sure Linus has a few words
to say

LINUS Yes I do But Im not so sure youre going to like
them Father I think youre being a little unfair to
David

OLIVER Im what

LINUS Well I I think Davids old enough to live his own life
if he decides Sabrinas the girl for him

OLIVER Nonsense

DAVID Linus you really mean that

LINUS Of course I mean it

DAVID But it would knock your plans for a loop

LINUS What plans The plastics merger Forget it Ifyou
love her take her This is the 20th century

OLIVER The 20th century I could pick a century out of a hat
blindfolded and get a better one Youll get rid of that
girl immediately do you understand And apologize to

your fiancé

LINUS Now Father dont push him Lets discuss this like
civilized people Sit down David
DAVID Thank you Linus

David is about to sit when he suddenly stands up and tries to leave

DAVID Look I really have to go Suppose you two work it out
LINUS Do you want me to help you or dont you

DAVID Of course Linus I appreciate what youre doing
LINUS Well then sit down

DAVID Linus youre the only one in this family who

understands me

Sabrina Either youre under eight cars looking for a
missing spark plug or youre perched up here umpiring
a tennis match between two players who arent there
Oh you look lovely Sabrina and very grown up

Id better get back to the party

And leave me here alone

What did David say

I dont know what you did to him but I havent seen
him in such a state since he was kicked in the head by
a polo pony at Old Westburry

Thats nice

Amnesia has definitely set in Hes completely
forgotten hes engaged He wants you

And I want him Ive been in love with him all my life

Mmm well there goes the engagement

You dont object

Object To you Its as though a window had been
thrown open and a lovely breeze swept through this

stuffy old house How could I object

Even though the breeze comes from the general direction

of the garage
Ah this is the 20th century Sabrina

Linus hands her a glass of champagne

SABRINA Thank you Lets drink to that

LINUS Im sorry it isnt David here instead of me But its
all in the family

SABRINA You know when you just walked in here I was sure
youd been sent by the family to deal with me

LINUS To deal with you

SABRINA Like in a Viennese operetta The young prince falls

in love with the waitress at the rathskeller and the Prime

Whats a krone these days No self-respecting Prime
Minister would offer kronen
SABRINA No self-respecting waitress would take dollars
LINUS Good girl

Linus kisses Sabrina on the cheek

LINUS Hey how does this operetta end Whats the last act

SABRINA I dont know I guess they run away to America on a
zeppelin with everybody singing like mad

LINUS They open a brewery in Milwaukee

Do you mind if we turned this off

Why

Because

Dont you like it

I used to like it

Certain songs bring back certain memories to me too
Did you love her

Id rather not talk about it

Im sorry

Thats all right

Its so strange to think of you being touched by a
woman I always thought you walked alone

No man walks alone from choice

As a child I used to watch you from the window over
the garage Coming and going always wearing your black
homburg carrying a briefcase and an umbrella I thought
you could never belong to anyone never care for anyone

Oh yes the cold businessman way up in his executive
suite No emotion just ice water in his veins and
ticker tape coming from his heart And yet one day that
same cold businessman high up in a skyscraper opens the
window steps out on a ledge stands there for three hours

wondering if he should jump

hard to believe someone might want to blot out everything
for sentimental reasons

Oh I believe it You know what I almost did because
of sentimental reasons I I went to Paris to blot it
out Maybe you should go to Paris Linus

To Paris

It helped me a lot Have you ever been there

Oh yes Once I was there for 35 minutes

35 minutes

Changing planes I was on my way to Iraq on an oil deal

But Paris isnt for changing planes Its Its for
changing your outlook For throwing open the windows and
letting in letting in la vie en rose

Paris is for lovers Maybe thats why I stayed only

35 minutes

goup Or you pick up a telephone and 100 tankers set out
for Persia Or you switch on a Dictaphone and say Buy
all of Cleveland and move it to Pittsburgh You must be
awfully clever
Oh its nothing really Just a small knack like
juggling three oranges
It isnt oranges its millions Suppose you dropped
one
Suppose I did Whats at the end ofa million Zero

Linus walks over to his desk and reads off the arrangements

LINUS A letter of credit An apartment in Paris A car

Dear David Yes I did get over that Im cured
Now I have to get over the cure

It wouldnt have worked out really darling The
papers and everybody else would have said How fine and
democratic for a Larrabee to marry the chauffeurs daughter
But would they praise the chauffeurs daughter No
Democracy can be a wickedly unfair thing Sabrina Nobody

poor was ever called democratic for marrying somebody rich

to the Larrabee-Tyson merger Much effort has gone into
making this union possible Long hours many obstacles to
overcome Nobody knows better than I However (to Miss
McCardle) Not yet (to group) However sometimes even
the most conscientious of businessmen can botch up a deal
for one reason or another

Now understand I I dont mean to say that our merger
has hit a snag or failed to jell or gone up in smoke or
fallen through Let me put it this way gentlemen It has
sailed away

OLIVER I seem to have missed something here Would you mind
starting again

man of distinction chairman of the board of Larrabee
Industries getting mixed up with his chauffeurs daughter

because youre here and shes out there Brother She

would have taken you for plenty
