CREDITS

Credits are played over Currier and Ives-like winter scenes
from life in Grand Rapids Its Christmas morning

-- Two well-bundled youths shovel out a suburban driveway
while their father scrapes ice off the family car

-- Youths pelter a passing car with snowballs Others more

daring companions grab onto the cars rear bumper and hitch
a free ride across the icy roads and past a sign which reads
Grand Rapids City Limits

-- Christmas decorations hang from the lamp posts on Monroe
Avenue

-- Children dressed in bright parkas and breathing steam
compare their Christmas presents sleds skis and a toboggan
In the bg other children speed down Richmond Park Hill

-- A womans distant voice sings an old hymn

Precious memories unseen angels
Sent from somewhere to my soul

How they linger ever near me

And the sacred past unfolds
Precious memories how they linger
How they ever flood my soul

In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold
Precious father loving mother

Fly across the lonely years

And old home scenes of my childhood
In fond memories appear

INT VAN DORN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Four generations of the Van Dorn family have gathered at the
family home

A long kitchen leads to the dining area then to the spacious
living room
The house is perhaps one hundred years old deeply varnished
woodwork and patterned yellow wallpaper section off the walls

Apart from several recent tasteless acquisitions (an E-Z Boy
lounge chair to replace the old Queen Anne which broke two
Easters ago) the house remains furnished in the style of
the previous century The old dining room table which
Grandfather Van Dorn built because he was too cheap to buy
one has now become a priceless antique

The rooms are littered with religious calendars Bibles and
plaster-of-Paris plaques bearing such sentiments as As For
Me and My House We Will Serve the Lord The oak buffet is
laden with similar religious knickknacks and chintz Framed
tinted photographs of the family patriarchs are

indiscriminately mixed with newer snapshots of proud fathers
and high school graduates

e house radiates a sense of continuity Generations come

nd go the family remains All of lifes old home scenes
ave been played out here births deaths romances
lasphemies betrayals And now the air is again alive with

e sounds of playing children busy housewives and bickering
ncles

eadoyroyd

The kitchen is crowded with mothers daughters and aunts
Each has brought a special dish ANNE DE JONG (nee Van Dorn)
thirty-five supervises the final preparations One aunt
shows another snapshots of her new grandchild

table watching the kitchen activity

AUNT

NEPHEW 2
-No way Uncle Joe talk me into

Rather work in the car wash

As the CAMERA TRACKS THROUGH the dining room it passes a
cluster of men standing near the buffet WES DE JONG and

JOHN VAN DORN both about forty casually discuss a
theological point with GRANDFATHER VAN DORN Across the table
a young boy about eleven listens with rapt awe

These are men of the soil Their faces are sun-blotched and
weather-beaten Wes has rolled up the sleeves of his white
shirt John has switched to a more comfortable plaid
JOHN
I still say that if a man has

committed the unpardonable sin he
knows he has
Grandfather nods head approvingly
WES

dont seem to account much for Gods

grace
JOHN

What kind of grace do you mean

Mary shows Jake the set for his approval

JAKE
Is this all the display space we can
get

MARY

I tried to get more but this is the
limit The De Vries line has the
same area

Mary is a cool efficient display designer Jake studies a
patch of bright blue on the right wall

JAKE
What do you think of this ah
shade of blue Mary

MARY
I like it Mr Van Dorn

JAKE
Dont you think its a little too
bright

MARY

Not really But if you want me to
tone it down

JAKE
No no I wouldnt hire a display
designer if I didnt trust her taste
Maybe we should bring in more of
that shade Perhaps a stripe across
the back wall
He gestures

Gently relentlessly Jake manipulates Mary He does not

wish to impose his taste on her but

through calculated

argument will get her to accept his views Its only a matter

of time before he wears her down

MARY
No that would be much too
overpowering

JAKE
Yeah overpowering That was the
word I was looking for

MARY
(sensing his ploy)
Mr Van Dorn Ive worked on the
color scheme for weeks I think its
just right

JAKE
Whats that shade of blue called

MARY
Pavonine Its the same tint as the
stripe in the fabric

Jake bends down and examines the chair

JAKE
Are you still going with that fella
that teaches at Grand Valley

MARY
Sam

JAKE
Yeah Hes a nice guy Dont lose
him Maybe we could tone down this
stripe a bit Its a little

MARY
(catching on)
Overpowering
JAKE
Yeah
MARY

(gives in)
Okay Mr Van Dorn I think we could
knock that Pavonine blue a bit

JAKE
Are you sure its all right
MARY
Yes I think itll look better

INT TWELFTH STREET CHURCH

REVEREND VANTIL a stately man about fifty stands at the
pulpit The front of the church is plain and stark adorned
only by a large wooden cross

The Christian Reformed Church is not one which believes in
emotional appeals or confessions It is a religion of
scripture creed and doctrine Reverend Vantil dressed in
black addresses the congregation as if he were a businessman
And his business is sin guilt and redemption

He speaks calmly and powerfully The church echoes with the
weight of his words

Q What is your only comfort in life
and death A That I body and soul

happily A Three the first how
great my sin and misery are the
second how I am delivered from all

EXT DOWNTOWN GRAND RAPIDS - DAY

Jake and Mast walk out of the Pantlind and walk up Monroe
Avenue The heart of Grand Rapids like that of many Mid-
western cities is a ghost town The major businesses have
one by one gone broke or moved out to the suburban malls
leaving the core of the city to cut-rate stores parking
lots and federally-subsidized government buildings

MAST
This used to be a real city I was
here about fifteen years ago

something youd better see

INT THEATRE - DAY

Jake is uncomfortably seated in the dingy thirty-seat theatre
Mast walks back from the projection booth as the film starts

He sits next to Van Dorn We slowly TRACK INTO Jakes face
as the color drains from it 0S We HEAR groans and the

sounds of flesh on flesh

We TRACK SLOWLY INTO the film itself

A 16mm hardcore short on a simple but classic theme -- rape
Two young men force a young unwilling girl to submit to
their desires The girl -- Kristen -- nude tries to get out

of a wrinkled bed but is restrained by the long arm of a
languid long-haired nude youth Another young man wearing
only pink elastic shorts steps into the frame and takes
Kristen into his arms

The quality of the action is quite low the young men posture
and overact in the manner of high school dramatics
Occasionally the action stops while the actors receive cues
from an off-screen director Grunts and groans are dubbed
into the screen action

Only Kristens performance lends a note of credibility to
the proceedings She is genuinely disoriented or frightened --
or both Shes not play acting

For one frightening moment Kristen regaining full
consciousness fights back but the youth in pink shorts
slaps her into submission Her eyes turn pleadingly toward
the camera

The first youth laughs and takes Kristen into his arms The
youth in the pink shorts kneels on the edge of the bed and
instructs Kristen to remove his shorts As she begins to do
this the first youth fucks her from the rear
As the film ends Jake sinks his head into his hands speaking
to himself Its almost as if were hearing his thoughts

JAKE
It cant be Why me What have I
done

Looking up he says softly then louder

JAKE
(continuing)
Turn it off
(a beat)
Turn it off
(a beat)
Turn it off

Only then does Jake realize that the film has already been
shut off and hes sitting alone in the quiet theatre

MAST

Mast calms him down
MAST
Wait Slow down A film like this

impossible to track Nobody makes
it nobody shows it nobody sees
it Its like it doesnt even exist

JAKE

JAKE

MAST
Yeah Probably

JAKE

Jake turns away

MAST
(continuing)

A porn film is being shot in a tacky motel room furnished
with a pink circular water bed a lime-brown shag rug and
peeling red felt wallpaper An oil painting of a seagull in
flight adds a touch of class

The small set is crowded with technicians and onlookers The
harried collegiate filmmakers wear scruffy jeans and T-shirts
The onlookers more refined sport double knit suits

Two girls and a middle-aged man lie on the pink satin sheets
Beach towels protect them from the unheated water bed One
of the girls NIKI has a long blonde wig and looks about
nineteen

The makeup girl hurriedly dabs some last minute cosmetic on
the second girls breast A young man in a UCLA T-shirt pastes
up the peeling wallpaper above the bed

filmmaker tries to bring the set to order

Mast walks into the rear of the room and looks around until

Ramada recognizes Mast as he walks toward him and motions
for him to follow

tenderloin He cruises down Santa Monica up Western along
Hollywood and back down to Santa Monica
He passes row upon row of garish adult bookstores massage
parlors and porn theatres He passes model shops topless
bars “erotic motels and peep shows

Teenage girls stand in the red neon shadows calling out to
passing strangers Drag queens and leather boys cruise the
sidewalks Jet black pimps sporting high heels and make
coats stroll from one massage parlor to another The sound
of Latin jazz comes from one doorway soul disco from another
LAPD black and whites patrol the streets Occasionally

a uniformed officer leans out to hassle a passing pimp or
hooker

He drives on The sex shops have names like The Sexual

Catharthis Center Pandoras Box The Institute of Oral

CUT TO
INT ADONIS BOOKSHOP - NIGHT

Jake steps into the bookstore and looks cautiously from side
to side

His expression is stern withdrawn as if suppressing some
physical pain He finds nothing titillating about this world
for him it is simply evil Neither is he shocked Has he not
been taught For every imagination of mans heart is only
evil continually

An improbable assortment of men peruse the long racks of
pornographic books and magazines A young MALE TELLER sits
next to a cash register atop a high counter Below him a
display case features sexual paraphernalia and films A small
radio softly plays Muzak

TELLER
Fifty cents admission
JAKE

applicable to a purchase

Jake fishes in his pocket comes up with a couple quarters
and places them on the counter The Teller gives him a token
in return

Van Dorn walks down one row and up another The explicit
titles and magazine covers leap out at him Cropped
Crotches Teenage Obedience Lesson Mouthful of Cock
Hogtie Many of the magazine covers feature obviously
underage girls He eases his way past a butch young man
looking at magazines in the gay section

Screwing up his courage Jake steps back to the counter

He tries but cannot avert his eyes from the grotesque sexual
novelties in the case Dildos some small some huge and
gross looking more like instruments of torture than pleasure
Stimulators vibrators spiked ticklers Penis enlargers
Leather paddles whips masks rubber vaginas fuck faces
masturbators

JAKE
Do you have a ah film called Slave
of Love

TELLER
What we got is just these here

glossy frame enlargement from Slave of Love folded to reveal
only Kristen

The Teller places two quarters on the counter

TELLER

walks back out into the neon night The Teller turns to no

simulation of a Medieval dungeon A large wood X-shaped cross
is bolted to one wall There are straps for the clients
hands and feet Instruments of torture hang from another
wall A bare-breasted girl wearing bikini pants and leather
chaps sits lethargically on a folding chair A mask of black
leather and buckles completely cover her face

Beatrice notices Jake is following them

BEATRICE

Jake is dazed by what he sees He wasnt even aware such
perversions existed

JAKE
No I dont think so

Jake turns and (like Lot from Sodom) walks away without
looking back As he leaves he passes the Second Hostess
attempting to communicate with two teenage MEXICANS

The Second Hostess forms an oval with the index finger and
thumb of her left hand and passes the index finger of her

barren a bed-sized slab of foam rubber lies on the floor

FELICE

making love

Felice quickly returns with a sheet and spreads it across
the foam She slides the door shut behind her

JAKE

Jake knocks over a small table The Manager has had enough
He grabs Jakes arm wrenches it tight behind his back and
rams Jakes face into the wall He forces Jake down the
stairway of love

Jake struggles and kicks but is no match for the larger
man At the foot of the stairs the Manager ejects Jake
thrusting him across the sidewalk

Jake rams face-first into a parked car He staggers on the
sidewalk His mouth and nose bloody

He looks back A black and white slows down Theres nothing

Pulling back a page of notes he reveals the unfolded 8x10
glossy from Slave of Love He looks at the two young men
violating his daughter then back up at Peter Long Long is
neither of the men

JAKE
(continuing)

The Black Stud turns and storms out
TIMECUT An angelic muscular boy about 19 stands in front

something else in mind

STUD 2

Jake nods with resignation

The boy drops his jeans Framed by firm smooth naked thighs
Van Dorn looks at the angelic boys stuff He nods

TIMECUT Its the end of the day The last orange rays of
sun come through the window

Jake weary looks up A young man steps in from the fading
sunlight

The young man looks about 21 His sun-bleached hair falls
just to his shoulders A hippie whos hit the streets

Jake looks at his 8x10 glossy then back at the young man
This is him This is the young man in the pink bikini shorts

This is the YOUTH from Kristens hardcore movie the one who
slapped her the one who forced her face into his crotch

JISM JIM

JAKE

JISM JIM
Jim Sullivan Sometimes they call me

JAKE
Thats not true Jim In fact I

Jim immediately becomes more compliant

JISM JIM
Oh yeah Ive done a lot of good

JAKE
Thats what I wanted to talk to you
about

Jake reaches over and picks up the glossy

JAKE
Ive seen you in some stuff I like

Jake shows him the glossy

JISM JIM
Oh yeah I remember that It was
made by some college kids

JAKE
It was called Slave of Love

JISM JIM
God I dont know what it was called
I never saw it I only got twenty-
five bucks for the whole Goddamned
thing

JAKE
I thought you were quite good in it
I also like the girl in it Really
thought she was good
(points out Kristen)
I wondered if she was still around
If she was still working

Jim examines Kristens picture His expression sours

JISM JIM
Wait
(a beat)
Wait a minute Look I need the work
and I want to be in your picture
but that is one bitch I will never
work with again
Jim nervous paces around He tries to explain

JISM JIM
(continuing)
Look that was one freaky bitch one
very very freaky bitch I dont
know what she was into I dont know
what she was on but I dont want to
have anything to do with her again

Jakes face grows cold and mean as he listens to Jims
description of his daughters defilement

JISM JIM

(cups genitals with

right hand)
Do you know what she did to me Do
you know what she did to me man
That fucking cunt I couldnt walk
for a week My prick was sore and
red and chewed out She was cra-zy
I dont want to work with her again

All the while Jim speaks Van Dorns long arm reaches slowly
for the lamp on his right

His right hand locks around the base of the lamp Still
listening watching Jim intensely Jake grips the balls of
his feet into the carpet

Jake is beyond logic beyond restraint

He rises lamp in hand The cord pops out of the wall the
bulb flashes out

Reaching across the table Van Dorn smashes the youth across
the face The plaster lamp shatters the shade flies off

Jim reels backward

Knocking over the coffee table Van Dorn advances on the
dazed bleeding youth

Van Dorn pounds him again with the plaster stump of the lamp

Van Dorn stops He looks down at Jism Jim The youth is barely
conscious

Realizing what hes done Jake pulls Jim up by his collar
and drags him into the bathroom

He hauls the youth into the large erotic shower He pulls
the shower douche off the wall and sprays Jims face

The battered youth opens his eyes Hes terrified Hes been
in kinky scenes before He pleads
JISM JIM
Hey stop stop Ill do anything
you want Its okay I can dig it
You can do anything you want to me

JAKE
(full of rage)
Where is she Where is the girl
JISM JIM
Shes got a man A white guy Tod

JAKE
Where does he hang out

JISM JIM
I dont know

JAKE

JISM JIM

Van Dorn lets him go and starts to walk away Looking back
he sees Jism Jim struggling to his feet Jake spins around
and punches him once more Jism Jim tumbles back into his
shower Jake walks off rubbing his red knuckles

He hands it to the woman

Jake cautiously pulls the curtain aside and steps into the
first booth

The booth is divided by a floor-to-top glass partition On
Jakes side of the partition is a pay wall phone On the
other is an orange folding chair

The sign on the phone reads One token -- two minutes Jake
puts a token in the phone

discussing a shade of blue in a convention display

Niki is street-wise She can instantly interpret situations
which would stymie the average person but as if to balance
this perceptivity she is often stymied by the ordinary

In brief she assumes Jake is paying her 900 a week not
only to help him but also to be his personal playmate

NIKI
Do you have any pills Any Valium
Librium You know pimps will sell
Valium at fifty cents a piece Can

cannot fall from the number of the
elect And thats the TULIP

this out This is like Rona Barrett
Before you become saved God already
knows who you are

JAKE
He has to Thats Predestination If
God is omniscient if He knows
everything -- and He wouldnt be God
if He didnt -- then He must have
known even before the creation of
the world the names of those who
would be saved

NIKI
So its already worked out The fix
is in

JAKE

More or less

NIKI
Wow Then why be good Either youre
saved or you aint

Out of gratitude for being chosen
Thats where Grace comes in God
first chooses you then allows you
by Grace to choose Him of your own
free will

Seeing no one he recognizes he pays his admission fee walks
down a rack picks up a copy of Hot Twat pages through
it

Its been over a week since Jake first stepped into a porno
bookstore The change in his manner is striking He now seems
at ease in the endless night-world of pandering and
pornography

A few moments later a long-haired man steps up behind him
The young man is wearing red alligator boots and a silver
and turquoise belt -- like the man in Slave of Love Tod
scrutinizes Jake a moment before speaking

TOD
(under his breath)
Hey Jake

Jake turns Tod gives him some skin Tod seems unattractive
at first but the longer one looks at him the more oddly
sensual he appears

Niki sits on a bed watching a syndicated sitcom and munching
a Taco Bell enchilada

She hears a CAR pull up and a mans FOOTSTEPS walks to the
door

She cautiously gets up to see who it is

corner and walk out of sight

CUT TO
INT HOT PINK - NIGHT

Tod leads Jake past two girls into the back of the parlor
Tod smiles to one of the parlor girls and touches the other

INT MASSAGE PARLOR - NIGHT

Tod ushers Jake into a barren office in the rear of the
parlor

A sheet has been tacked up at one end of the office Across
the room the projectionist a boy about 15 stands next to
a battered old 16mm silent projector

Two other men sit in the darkened room One looks middle-

aged and decadent the other about 26 wears jeans a western
shirt and a beat up flight jacket Hes saved up several
years for this

Jake sits in an empty office chair next to the other men

Tod nods to the boy and he starts up the projector A grainy
black and white image appears on the screen

The projectionist punches a cheap cassette player which echoes
scratchy Mexican fiesta music through the room

Its clear why the projectionist has chosen a Latin sound
track the film is set up in a Tijuana flophouse

On screen a girl with long blonde hair and Kristens build
sits on the edge of a barren double bed She wears jeans and
a shirt Her face is covered by a black leather mask The
eye slits are taped shut
A Cerveza poster of a half-naked Mexican girl hangs on the
wall behind her

A young Mexican stripped to the waist walks over to the
girl Taking instructions from someone off camera he starts
to undress her

The girl unable to see her seducer nevertheless submits to
his desires

Jake watches the screen from the shadows The pale images
flicker across a metal filing cabinet behind him Tod slips
out of the room

On screen the young Mexican has finished the girl He turns
to the director for further instructions

A man wearing a white suit walks into the frame He flashes
a stiletto from his sleeve and stabs the young Mexican The
girl not able to see what is happening turns her head
quizzically

Jake watches in unbelieving horror The young man in the
flight jacket is calm and dispassionate

The young Mexican falls to the floor bleeding The man in
the white suit bends down and wipes the stiletto on the
Mexicans pant leg

The man in the white suit steps over to the girl and puts
one hand under her mask He lifts his stiletto again He
rips off the mask from the girls face it is not Kristen

Jake is relieved The faces of the others are full of
anticipation

Jakes relief turns to horror at what he now sees Blurred
images reflect against the metal cabinet behind him

a wave of familiar smells Human sweat blood and sexual
fluids

The House of Bondage specializes in the three disciplines

rooms each decorated in a different decor -- Babylonian
Medieval Louis Quatorze prison motifs -- to satisfy a
variety of tastes

tries to twist them Tod breaks free and Jake smacks him
across his forehead with his open hand

TOD

Jake is beyond reasoning Tod looks around for an alternate
route of escape

Tod ducks into the Prison Room Jake follows

Vertical bars cover the grey walls Handcuffs and chains
hang from the bars In the center of the room a Harley
Davidson Hog is incongruously mounted its front wheel
pointed skyward Leather straps are attached to the
handlebars

Tod skirts the Harley and pushes it toward Jake as he enters
The huge 1200-pound machine crashes toward Van Dorn

Jake jumps back as the bike bounces in front of him then
starts for Tod

Lowering his shoulder Tod smashes through the thin pasteboard
wall Jake steeping over the motorcycle pursues

In the Louis Quatorze Room Jake grabs Tod by the shoulders
and spins him around Tod swings as he turns hitting Jake

Jake grabs Tods legs as he falls

They both crash through the next pasteboard wall into the
Medieval Dungeon

Tod breaks free runs through the dungeon and bursts through
the last pasteboard wall Jake pulls himself to his feet and

follows

Jake burst through the wall and dash out the front door

stiletto at Jake

Jake protecting himself from the knife flips Ratan over
Ratans chest and stomach rasp across the jagged glass

Jake grabs Ratans head in both his hands and forces it
downward onto the bottom edge of the jagged window frame

He rubs Ratans neck across the glass every artery vein
and capillary rip out of Ratans neck

Ratan collapses against the window frame

Anne embraces her tearfully

-- Jake back at work talks to Mary near the lathes

-- Niki wearing white vinyl boots and a blonde wig walks

-- Kristen lies sleeping peacefully in her bedroom
-- Jake sleeps Blue light falls across his face

Slowly burning through his face the grainy black and white
image of a girl wearing a black mask appears A hand reaches
down to pull off the mask

Jake wakes suddenly from his dream his screaming face double-
exposed with the terrified young girls

FADE OUT
