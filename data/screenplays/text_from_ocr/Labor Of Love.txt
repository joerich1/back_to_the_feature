FADE IN
EXT ROUTE 476 - OUTSKIRTS OF PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

A three lane highway relegated to one lane The serpentine
line of cars bottlenecks as it slithers by An arch of
ORANGE AND RED FLARES outlines the area of shattered glass
and twisted metal

We are at the site of a gruesome car accident An ambulance
and four police cars are on the scene Two cars are involved
in the crash The first a SILVER CADILLAC with its front
caved in a perfect semi-circle there is no-one inside the
car

The second car is a different story entirely A DARK GREEN
HONDA PRELUDE crushed against the concrete median that
separates the South-bound lanes from the North-bound lanes
All the windows have imploded The original seventeen foot
length of the car compressed to ten The hood has folded
back into the front seat This car is not empty Through
the sliver that used to be a window WE SEE a female hand
purple swollen and bloody

Some drivers have stopped their cars on the shoulder and have
walked over to the flares A set of cops wave them back

POLICE OFFICER
Get back in your cars and continue
with the traffic There is nothing
you can do
(beat)
Get back in your cars

his back and being led to a police car

ELLEN

Maurice pulls out a small bent card from between the stems

MAURICE
Its from Dan and Kate Wilkins
for dinner last week

Maurice hands Ellen the card she looks at it uninterested

MAURICE
Its a special day isnt it

ELLEN
Well Im sure its not Christmas
because youd be worried about how
much money we dont have to spend
on each other I know its not
New Years because youd be going
on and on about wearing a tuxedo
and how much you dont like to
dance and Im sure its not our
anniversary because I didnt find

an envelope with a hundred dollars
cash on my bureau with a note that
says Pick out something

The spines of the BOOKS catch the light rows and rows of
books cradled by a maze of mahogany book shelves This is an
old-fashioned store with antique chairs at select places A

cushioned sofa-chairs This store is a home

Maurice comes around the corner -- the boys HAUL ASS out of
the store Theyre long gone before Maurice reaches the
door He yells after them

MAURICE

Ellen who is sitting in the back room doing the accounts
comes out when she hears the commotion

ELLEN

years I think they know youre
bluffing

at him curiously

Maurice notices the STRAIN IN HER VOICE

MAURICE
Is this going to be similar to the

ELLEN
(very emotional)
Sometimes people need to see things
done for them -- because sooner or
later they dont believe the words
anymore

No I dont I dont even know if

Maurice is getting redder by the second The entire
restaurant hangs on his response

MAURICE
So what have you done for me thats
so earth-shattering

The waiter closest to the table cringes with Maurices words
Ellen drains of color She stares at him in complete and
utter disbelief She drills him with this iron glare for an
eternity then grabs her purse and heads to the exit Maurice
stares at the table for a moment to gather whats left of his
dignity and follows her out

The waiter moves to the table and clears the aftermath He
sees Ellens fortune crumpled next to her tea cup He
unravels it The fortune reads

-- in your pajamas -- at 1115 at
night Are you going to show it to
someone

MAURICE
No

ELLEN
Then why

MAURICE
Theres no reason

ELLEN

Exactly No reason No occasion
It just makes you feel good to do
something for it to express your
pride and affection for it some
how

(beat)
How come youd do that for a piece

THE TELEPHONE RINGS
Maurice rises from his seat -- but is waved off by ADELLE

MATLIN who picks up the phone right away Adelle is
Maurices niece early thirties very attractive and always

smiling -- except at this moment
Ted begins another one of his stories -- the words are
incoherent as Maurice watches Adelle carefully Adelle

turns her back to the room as she talks and then DISAPPEARS
into the kitchen stretching the phone cord around the
doorway Something is definitely wrong

Maurice steadies his gaze at the door of the kitchen
eternal seconds pass before Adelle appears again She looks

different -- ghostly She glances up for a fraction of a
second locking eyes with her uncle -- she immediately looks
away

Maurice watches Adelle move to her husband GERALD and
whispers in his ear Gerald changes instantly -- taking on
the same ghostly transformation -- his eyes dart to Maurice

Teds story is cut off as Maurice speaks LOUDLY

The room goes SILENT as all eyes fall on Adelle and Gerald

GERALD

This hits everyone in the room like a bomb A dread hangs

over every passing second Gerald crumbles under the

Some of the crowd reacts A women covers her mouth The
moment is unbearable

MAURICE
(to himself)
Please God -- dont do this

Gerald cracks -- the tears start to flow from his eyes

know how to --

Gerald buries his face into the heels of his palms as if
trying to contain an explosion in his head

GERALD
Oh Jesus please help me She
didnt Ellen didnt make it

Ellens dead Maurice

Maurice closes his eyes shut tightly like a child scared
of the dark

Adelle blacks out knocking over the wine chiller on the way
to the ground In less than a minute the room has
transformed from a celebration to a mourning Everyone is
frozen staring at Maurice for their cue A child in her
mothers arms begins to cry as if aware of the circumstances

dresses

He reaches out and pulls the cloth of a floral dress towards
him He closes his eyes and smells the cloth his face
tightens in pain both hands cling to the dress tightly
he tries desperately cant fight it -- Maurice Parker begins
to cry

His hands grab frantically at the rest of the dresses --
pressing them to his face and chest

MAURICE
Oh God Im sorry Ellen Im so
sorry

He hugs the dresses as if they were her His weeping turns
to a torturous wail of grief all the love all the anger
spilling out in this one moment

Their warm laughs and whispered conversations stinging him

make him stay but he playfully pulls away She shakes her
head like a shy school girl as the old man walks back down

back

over the hill in the opposite lane moving fast too fast

The SOUND OF TINY FOOTSTEPS stirs him He looks to the
doorway to find Isaac standing quietly at the door in his
baseball PJs

MAURICE

ISAAC

Isaac walks silently to Maurice Tip-toeing all the way
MAURICE
Your parents would want you to be
in bed
ISAAC

You tell stories

MAURICE
Oh no Im not good at that
Very bad in fact

Too late Isaac climbs up into Maurices lap with great
effort Maurice looks down at Isaac who waits patiently for
him to begin

MAURICE
I would be exceedingly boring

Isaac waits

MAURICE
I dont do these type of things

Isaac -- still waiting

MAURICE
See there are two kinds of people
in this world
(beat)
Just a short one okay

Isaac gets in position cradled in Maurices arms Maurice
searches for something to say

MAURICE
There was a boy named Isaac who
wanted to play baseball but he was
too small and no one would let him

MNightFanscom
play but he kept practicing by
himself -- waiting He went to
every game and sat in the stands
with his glove

ISAAC
You know what maybe I ran onto
the field and hit a home run

MAURICE
Whos telling this story

Isaac points to Maurice

MAURICE
Good now the team had this great
big player -- Big Billy He was

the best He had them in the World
Super-Bowl-Championship of little
kids baseball But right before
the game the second best player on
the team was suspended because he
played a prank on a nice man who
owned a book store When that boy
grew up he was convicted on
burglary charges and spent fifteen
years in prison -- where he
belongs

Isaac didnt understand that last part

MNightFanscom

MAURICE
Anyway Big Billy needed another
player so he yelled into the
stands ‘Who can play baseball
And there was a little voice that
yelled out Me I can play
Everyone turned to see a little boy
standing with a glove

ISAAC
(beaming)
Thats me
MAURICE
Right But everyone saw how small
Isaac was and laughed but not

Big Billy He stared at Isaac
carefully and then told him to join
the game It came to the end of
the game It was the eleventh or
twelfth inning or whatever is the
last inning of a game

ISAAC
Nine
MAURICE
Okay nine Big Billys team was
losing and he was on base Thats
when Isaac came up He could

barely hold the bat Big Billy
winked at Isaac The ball was
pitched -- Isaac hit the ball hard

It soared up and out over the
stadium Everyone cheered Isaac
hit a home run and won the game
After the game Isaac asked Big
Billy why he let he play Big
Billy smiled and said I wasnt
always Big Billy I was Little
Billy first Isaac and Big Billy
went off after the game and read a
classic book together The end

ISAAC
You know what -- that was a really
good story Tell it again

Maurice has to smile as Isaac looks up anxiously

tightly to his hand Mr Caldwell meets Maurice halfway and

pulls him aside

MR CALDWELL

MAURICE
(unstrapping it)

MR CALDWELL

MNightFanscom

Maurice watches him suspiciously as he pulls out an envelope
from his jacket pocket

MR CALDWELL
Lets say I give you whats in this
envelope for that beautiful watch

Maurice is handed the envelope He opens it to find a thick
PILE OF CASH TENS AND TWENTIES

MR CALDWELL
I really want that watch

MAURICE
This isnt right

MR CALDWELL
This is my only chance to get a
watch like that It would mean a
lot to me and my family Please

Maurice stares into the envelope emotionally and hands over
the watch tentatively

MAURICE
This is a loan

Mr Caldwell straps on the watch and then hugs Maurice
The rest of the family say their good-byes

Isaac wont let go of Maurices hand as he walks out into the
street

Isaac just holds on tighter After Maurice and Isaac have
walked a few steps out into the street Maurice kneels down

A merciless sun beats down on a long stretch of highway The
black tar from the road melting slightly

MNightFanscom
No sign of Maurice WE SEE into the distance not a soul in
sight WE LOOK to a hillside a hundred meters from the road
There we see a figure lying still in the shade of an
overhanging rock formation

Maurice has a towel over his eyes and his feet propped up on
his shoulder bag He is fast asleep

DISSOLVE TO

The SUN TURNS RED for one brilliant moment before hiding
behind the horizon Like an alarm went off Maurice wakes up
and packs his things

CUT TO

The MOONLIGHT outlines a line figure hobbling his way step by
step with a walking stick

The air fills with a POWERFUL RUMBLE Maurice turns to see a
wave of rocks and sand slide down a hillside to the road
They CAUSE A GREAT THUNDER that settles to dust Maurice
walks down the center of the highway away from the hillside

DISSOLVE TO
EXT HIGHWAY - DAWN

THE FIERY NEVADA SUN BEGINS ITS ASCENT INTO THE SKY Maurice
looks bad Hes breathing heavy as he moves up a steep
incline by the side of the road His feet slide on the loose
dirt Maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment

He makes it to the indentation in the hillside -- just enough
room to lay down in the shade Maurice lays out slowly He
pries off his sneakers band-aids and blisters cover every
inch of his feet Maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers
and painfully pulls them back on His eyes close as he tries
to unbutton his jacket too late hes asleep

Maurices bed is a rock that juts from the side of the
hill First WE SEE nothing then some grains of sand escape
from the crack where the rock meets the hillside The CRACK
BECOMES SLIGHTLY LARGER -- PULLING AWAY FROM THE HILL BY A
FRACTION OF AN INCH It stabilizes there

five feet above the ground

Maurice stirs in his sleep moving closer to the edge of the

A STEADY STREAM OF SAND POURS FROM THE CRACK

THEN THE FRIGHTENING SOUND OF ROCK MOVING AGAINST ROCK

Maurice wakes up as he begins to slide off Hands scraping
at the dirt He SLIDES OFF THE ROCK Feet and hands
desperately trying to cling to the hillside He picks up
speed as he tumbles down Maurice looks down in time to see
a small jut in the rock hurtling towards him no time for
panic SLAM A SICKENING CRACK OF BONE as Maurice HITS the
rock square in the ribs Maurice flops down the rest of the
slope like a rag doll he comes to rest in the dirt

clutching his ribs The sun beats down on his stunned eyes

Maurice stares up at the dizzying slope Sand still
trickling down to a stop He doesnt try to move for the
first few seconds His breathing increasingly erratic

Maurice drags himself to sit upright The sharp pains
causing a distorted grimace on his face A short rest
before working his way to his feet

CUT TO

Maurice uses a highway guardrail as a backrest He takes a
seat in the dirt Maurices hair is damp with sweat His

breathing relegated to slow gasps His left hand covering

his rib cage protectively Blood begins to trickle through
the spaces between his fingers

Maurice closes his eyes for a moment before his bent leg
goes into spasms Maurice is forced to straighten the leg
instantly jarring his tender rib cafe Maurice clings to
the back of his thigh Maurice is defeated On the verge
of tears

He glances way down the road and spots a TINY CLOUD OF SMOKE
miles away in the distance A car is moving in his
direction

Maurice looks up into the DAZZLING WHITE SKY Drops of sweat
falling into his eyes

Its over Ellen I failed you

again

Maurice looks down the road at the cloud of dust growing

dont have the strength

sky again The tears racing the sweat down his cheeks
Maurice YELLS TO THE HEAVENS

MAURICE
You said I would never be alone
You promised
(his yelling turns to
sobs)
You promised

Maurices is interrupted by A SLIGHT RUSTLING BEHIND HIS
HEAD Maurice turns and looks through his tears

There a few feet from him perched quietly and majestically
on the guardrail is a GOLDEN EAGLE It stands two and half
feet tall It spreads its great wings The feathers expand
like a blanket spanning six feet and throwing a gentle
shade on Maurices face

Maurice is frozen in wonder The MAGIC of the moment glows

in his eyes Maurices face gains life The dark feathered
eagle stands like a god before Maurice The moment is
breathtaking

CUT TO
ROAD

The car on the road takes the last quarter mile in
seconds SCREECHING ITS BRAKES at the sight of Maurice on
the side of the road

Maurice turns away from the bird as the car pulls up The
driver gets out and calls over the hood

DRIVER
Hey man are you okay

Maurices face filled with strength He grins through the
pain

MAURICE
Im fine

DRIVER
What the hell are you doing out
here You need a ride somewhere

MAURICE
No thank you

MNightFanscom
The driver is concerned He opens the driver door

DRIVER

MAURICE
No

This pacifies the driver somewhat He nods and gets in the
car Maurice watches as the car pulls away

He turns back to the guardrail -- the eagle is gone Maurice
looks up into the sky The Golden Eagle is flying
overhead a tiny dot against the blazing sun

Maurice struggles to his feet using the guardrail as support
Maurice takes his first step

serious this is Uncle

MAURICE
How serious is it

DR RAY who has been standing by the window listening steps
forward

DR RAY
You have two broken ribs a
punctured spleen and Acute
Rheumatoid Arthritis

Maurice gives a comforting smile to Adelle

DR RAY
The normal amount of build up in
your arteries has been aggravated
by over exertion This is called
Claudication As a result there
isnt enough circulation to your
body That accounts for the
discoloration in your extremities
and the muscle spasms Im sure
youve encountered

MAURICE
Can it kill me

DR RAY
It can but itll have to wait in
line

This surprises Maurice

DR RAY
We ran acCT and an MRI We
found bleeding in your brain Your
collapse was caused by Transient
Cerebral-Ischemia a sudden loss
of blood circulation to the brain
In other words Mr Parker you had
a mild stroke

MNightFanscom
There is dead silence in the room

MAURICE
(scared)
I suppose I over did it

Adelle moves over to Maurices side and holds his hand

MAURICE
What steps do we take now

We operate We find the artery in
the brain and close the bleeding
I just did this procedure on a
Senator and hes doing fine

MAURICE

What are the odds Do I have a
fifty-fifty chance of surviving the
operation

DR RAY

Its hard to say Its a delicate

surgery Theres no getting around
the fact that its a very high-risk
situation

Adelle strokes Maurices hair Maurice stares down at his
food before looking up with great resolve

MAURICE
Then itll have to wait until I
finish

I finish the walk and then we may

Let me tell you a story Sergeant
There was a patient of mine who had
a Golden Retriever Mac She
loved Mac not like a pet but like
a family member One day she had
to leave Mac with friends and
wouldnt you know it Mac gets away
and ends up falling into a sewer
My patient comes back -- goes nuts
when she hears that Mac has been in
the sewer for over 48 hours
Apparently the cop who found the

MNightFanscom
dog didnt want to get his pants
dirty And neither did anyone
else So of course my patient
decides to go in after it she
falls breaks her hip and lands
next to her dead dog who died of
toxic fumes down there

The moral of the story is She
sued for a lot of money She sued
the friends the city and the
