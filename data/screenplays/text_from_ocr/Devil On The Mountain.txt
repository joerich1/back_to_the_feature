DEVIL ON THE MOUNTAIN

The way grows narrow and darkSuddenly you find yourself
face to face with a towering figure a shadow composed of all
your doubts and fears and well armed to defend a treasure

- Joseph Campbell The Heros Journey
EXT MOUNTAIN ROADWAY - NIGHT

A long stretch of road Pretty damn lonely We are way up
there Surrounded by dark trees and darker mountains

WALNUT CREEK VERMONT - 15 YEARS AGO

A LONE WOMAN sits road side her car steaming This we will
get to know as SARA Late 20s pretty vulnerable

A TOW TRUCKs red lights appear through the night mist
casting an eerie glow across the road The truck pulls up
behind the car the door opens and the driver steps out
This is CHASE JACKSON 30 to 40 strong fellow The two
approach each other stopping a few feet short

CHASE
Car trouble huh

SARA
Nothing better at this time of
night

CHASE
Well mam let me see what I can do

Chase moves to the front of the car looks it over as Sara
watches over his shoulder

SARA
Is it bad

CHASE
Could be worse Busted water
heater hose

Chase faces the woman his eyes penetrating hers

SARA
Expensive huh

He looks her up and down

( )

CHASE
Well at this time of night it
might be extra costly

SARA
(taken a bit by surprise)
Oh really You mean youll charge
me more for a night call

It is obvious where Chase is going with this flirting

CHASE
Well its possibleI might be
able to accept payment in other

ways
She seems to be giving in

SARA
Wellthis doesnt sound ethical

He moves invery close

CHASE
Well lets just call it a barter

SARA
I see

Then the two engage in a long kiss Sara pulls back and
punches Chase in the chest

SARA (CONTD)
ChaseHow could you let me go to
work with a busted water hose

CHASE
(cubs his sore chest)
Honey I told you about that hose a
week ago

SARA
Telling me and fixing it are two
different things

CHASE
What about all that womens lib

SARA
Im still happy being a woman thank
you very much

NTINUED 2
co ° nothin wrong RAlGON Ry traditions
in this lifeLike the man fixing
things
(beat)
Who is watching Raquel

Chase moves back to his truck

CHASE
You know for an twelve year old
she can almost run the shop
herself Shes fine honey she can
get us on the CB if she needs to

Chase fishes through his TOOL BOX for a clamp and hose
And then we hear that sound The HAUNTING CACKLE OF THE CB

RADIO from his truck It cuts through the rustic silence
like a knife

RADIO
-heysomeone out
thereanybody

Chase Stands up slowly wipes his hands He listens as the
radio once again goes silent suddenly making his
surroundings feel a lot more spooky

RADIO (CONTD)
(CRACK) Somebody on the

lineHoly mother that thing was
hugemoves like the wind
toobigger than a bearHello

Chase slowly moves towards the radio as if it were alive
He reaches across the seat and grabs a hold of the mic

CHASE
This is Chase Jackson Who is
that Over

Nothing He waits a moment maybe hoping there will be no
answer

CHASE (CONTD)
Come on back Over

A beat Then

RADIO
Hey-heyWhats your ten four

Chase jumps sighs

( )

CHASE
Highway twenty four just east of
Lonesome Trail

Another beat maybe longer Feels like it

RADIO
-Did you see it then Its
incredible Its heading your way
Have you seen

Nothing

CHASE
Hello Whats headed my way Come
back friend

Wham A FLASH OF LIGHT hits Chase like a club Sara stands
near by with an OLD TIME VIDEO CAMERA filming her husband
playfully

CHASE (CONTD)
Geez honeyyou can blind a guy
with that thing

She smiles shifts it around the area

SARA

Grumpy husbandthats what you
are Grumpy stubborn wants to do
things his way full of pride But
you know whatyou also believe in
the best in life like no one I have
ever known No matter how bad times
get no matter how hard you want to
resistyou always find a way to
come shining through

He smiles and gets back to work Her light crosses the
forest illuminating the thick trees in an eerie light

SARA (CONTD)
This video camera was worth every
penny

Suddenly SOMETHING HUGE MOVES THROUGH FRAME in the thicket
Sara jumps startled Her eyes now riveted on the tree-line
and what it holds She moves hypnotized towards where the
disturbance was across the highway her camera still trained
on the trees

Chase continues to fidget with his gear not noticing

( )

CHASE
Grumpy huh Why not I support
my family driving a tow truck I
live in a town that isnt even on
some maps My accomplishments I
could count on one hand Yeah me
grumpy

Sara is still transfixed on what she saw in the dark moving
towards it The air is almost completely SILENT

WHAM A CAR smashes into her from out of nowhere Chase
spins

CHASE (CONTD)
Sara

Too late Her body is thrown into the air

Chase runs to his wife in a panic dropping to his knees at
her crumpled body He cradles her easily in his lap knowing
damn well what is about to happen

CHASE (CONTD)
No sweetheartno Please dont

go

Beside her is the camera Battered and torn

The car weaves onward its drunken driver has no intention
of stopping

Chase watches his wife slip from him as he rocks her slowly
Her eyes reaching out to him

SARA
Did you see itDid you
Wasnt itamazing

And she is gone

Then something appears just ahead of him Something in
the darkness quiet but yet very overpowering The huge
figure appears to be standing upright watching Chase from
the depths of the trees Its breathing low from the bowels
of the earth

Whatever it isit is enough to draw Chases attention to
it his teary eyes straining in the night to see what his

wives eyes had

( )

THEN WE
CUT TO
BLACK SCREEN

The SHORT TITLES BEGIN as we hear the VOICE OF AN
INTERVIEWER

INTERVIEWER
So have you actually ever seen a
Sasquatch

And then
EXT WALNUT CREEK —- DAY

The kind of sleepy village youd expect to find The one
where the local grocery store sponsors the yearly fair
Rustic but beautiful Grandma-town

A WIRE-RIMMED GLASSES WEARING RED HEADED KID about 12 looks
INTO LENS the subject of an obvious news piece We are
seeing this through the grain of 16mm or the pixilation of
video A FESTIVITY IN THE BACKGROUND

KID
YeahI saw him once He was
stealing a chicken from our yard
He was big and scary and hairy
(beat)
Then he got back on his giant space
ship and flew back to outer space
(beat)
And they had really bright lights

SERIES OF SHOTS - TITLES
WALNUT CREEK —- TODAY

We move through the town of Walnut Creek as our CREDITS ROLL
A Rockwellian picture Not much has changed here But like
Roswell it is apparent this town has grown famous for
something else Bigfoot Images some absurdly humorous of
the hairy man beast adorn everything from shoe stores to gas
stations A sign with the giant humanoid reads HOME OF THE
FAMOUS JACKSON FOOTAGE

A tourist trap if there ever was one And its in full swing
here as cars and trucks move down the small street tooting
their horns Its NATIONAL BIGFOOT DAY at least according
to the sign in the hands of the guy in THE GORILLA SUIT

( )

Disposable cameras click away capturing the towns big

event

WE SEE THROUGH THE UNSEEN NEWS CREWS CAMERA as they grab
sound bites from THE MANY RESIDENTS who either shun or delve
heavily into the idea of Bigfoot roaming their land

All these home spun interviews are penetrated by QUICK BURSTS
of OLD BIGFOOT STYLE PHOTOS Men holding giant feet casts and
sketches of what might be There is also clips of SARAS
VIDEO FOOTAGE That nightin the dark Something giant
moving through the trees

INTERVIEWER
We are here in Walnut Creek a once
sleepy town awaken by the now
famous video clip known in the
Bigfoot community as the Jackson
Footage Captured by the late Sara
Jackson who was killed in an
accident that same night it has
become the Holy Grail in the
cryptozoology circles the greatest
find in Sasquatch studies As a
result this once obscured village
now shares in its own kind of
celebrity

The news crew approaches who we will get to know as Sheriff
HARRIS ZEFF but you might not know it The early side of
70 he is dressed in his civies Probably past his prime but
the job here requires only so much from him He seems a bit
uncomfortable on camera but smiles all the same

HARRIS
Have I seen him Uh no sir I
havent I have seen the
occasional prankster in a monkey
suit But all this attention does
put smiles on most peoples faces
here Not to mention a few helpful
tourist dollars

Next we see KEN ROBINSON Deputy 30s dark features
fixated his eyes scanning the area The kind of guy that
takes charge He smiles humoring the TV crew

KEN
Sasquatch is a very old legend
Teddy Roosevelt even wrote about an
apparent Sasquatch attack in his
book back in 1890 The tradition
hasnt died out yet

It is obvious this town has finally earned a spot on the map
EXT STREET - DAY

A nice corner of the town A TRADITIONAL FAMILY walks

Through the window we see what must be Wade and Kyle
animatedly waving their guns around the room at the few
PATRONS on the floor

asphalt pretty quickly
EXT GAS STATION - DAY

NINE MINUTES EARLIER

A gas station whose clock stopped working around the 1969
rests just off the side of the road

An SUV Pulls up to the pumps The door opens and we see
ERIN PRICE late 20s A face to fall in love with but eyes
that look like they have seen the bad side of that already
Erin stretches a moment and then turns to her finger

( )

An ENGAGEMENT RING catches the light of the sun She stares

at it begins to slowly push it off her finger with her

thumbthen stops She sighs and turns to

A LONG TABLE displaying an array of GOODIE ANTIQUES AND
TRINKETS Including a VIDEO TAPEone we may have seen

before She walks over to all of it

RAQUEL (0C)
Thats a special tape

Erin turns to see RAQUEL JACKSON 20s country pretty
Blonde hair and blue eyes that make you want to smile
her coveralls she moves over to Erin

ERIN
Special

Raquel moves over extends her hand

RAQUEL
Raquel

ERIN
(shakes hand)
Erin
(beat)
Raquel

RAQUEL
My daddy loves Raquel Welsh I
mean he loved my momma too but
you know men

ERIN
Yeah

Erin gives a half smile something in that comment maybe

tearing at her Erin picks up the tape

ERIN (CONTD)
So whats special about this

RAQUEL
This tape is kind of infamous or
even famous depending on who you
talk to They call it the Jackson
Footage For better or for worse
kind of put this little town on the
map You might have even caught a
piece of it on TV at one time or
another

In

( )

Erin is now curious as to where this girl is going

RAQUEL (CONTD)
Its the last thing my mother ever
saw before she was killed

Erin reacts to this her attention now locked

RAQUEL (CONTD)

And in some ways its now the
first thing my father ever seems to
remember

(beat)
It only lasts a couple seconds and
kind of hard to see as is usually
the case but there is something
there Maybe a bear someone in a
suitbut its there

(Raquel tries to remain

strong)
Its grabs your attention like it
did my mother that night

Erin lost in the moment wanting to hear more begins to
speak when Raquel snaps back into today pulling out of the
past laughs

RAQUEL (CONTD)
You want me to fill her up

ERIN
Uhyeah Please

Raquel moves to the pumps while Erin watches her go
EXT GAS STATION - DAY

Erin climbs into the car as Raquel finishes pumping the gas
and moves to the window Erin pays her

ERIN
Here ya go

RAQUEL
Thanks So where you running to

Erin almost looks caught in the headlights

ERIN
Running to

( )

Raquel nods to the sealed boxes in the back seat taped up in
a hurry

RAQUEL
Not that Im being noseywell
maybe a bit I watch a lot of
those detective shows I saw all
them boxes taped up like you were
in a rush But everything else in
your car looks so neat Made me
think you arent sloppy so you must
have been in a real hurry

Erin laughs knowing she has been pegged

ERIN
That is pretty good YeahGuess
I am in a hurry Trying to leave
one life behind and start a new
one
(beatplays with ring)
Maybe I was in too much of a rush

Raquel looks at Erin thinks a beat and then hands her the
tape

RAQUEL

You take this I really dont know
what I could have sold this for
It would have either been too much
or not enough I think if anyone
should take this out of my life
its someone who knows how to move
on

(re The Indian Totem)
Ill even toss this in for free
For luck

ERIN
Thanks That means a lot

RAQUEL
Believe me my pleasure

Erin begins to drive off She stops a moment at the road
when she notices something She tilts her rear view mirror
to see the side of the gas station

Standing there watching her leave is a man 50s Partially
obscured by the screen door His piercing gaze hits her even
from there This is CHASE JACKSON twenty years older since
we last saw him

( )

BANG BANG

THE ECHO OF GUN SHOTS ring out in the distance Erin turns
to listen a moment and when she turns back she sees Chase as
he disappears around the back Erin shrugs and drives off

EXT ROADSIDE - DAY

We PAN ACROSS the beautiful landscape of this mountain oasis
but the view soon turns into something not so beautiful

The totem from Erins vehicle lies broken on the ground We
catch pieces of smoking metal before getting to the first
automobile carcass

On its side is Erins truck its body already engulfed in
flames

INT SUV — DAY

Erins eyes flutter open Blood drips down from her
forehead She looks through her cracked windshield and sees

Another car up on a rock Wade stumbles around aimlessly
The window is kicked open as Travis moves out with Kayla

Flames erupt around Erins cab She reaches for her seat
belt releases it drops to the ground and looks to A
BACKPACK at her feet She tosses it to the ground outside
As she scrambles to get out she notices a hand grabbing her
backpack As she moves towards the window the same hand
suddenly reaches in and yanks her out

EXT ROADSIDE - DAY

Dragged from the burning vehicle she looks up to her savior
and sees Lukes bloody face her backpack in his hand

LUKE
How ya feel

ERIN
II dont know Okay I guess

LUKE
You got insurance

Luke laughs drops the backpack and moves off Erin looks
around her the scene growing more surreal by the second

( )

Travis and Kayla begin pulling automatic weapons from the
van Dustin is scrambling to stuff some CASH laying on the
ground into the bag

Kyle is laying motionless on the ground

TRAVIS
Grab the money Wade

But Wade is to focused on his bloody brother

WADE
Kyle

He moves towards his fallen body shakes him

WADE (CONTD)
Get up Come on get up Kyle

As Erin moves to her feet Kayla moves towards her
ERIN
(to Kayla)

Are you okay

Kayla answers with a front kick to Erins stomach dropping
her

KAYLA
Just fine How are you

Wade turns to Erin fire in his eyes as he pulls his gun

WADE
Ill kill you I11 kill you

Luke jumps in grabs the gun hand as it goes off into the
air

WADE (CONTD)
Let go you ass

TRAVIS
Wade Stay cool

WADE
Travis Kyle is dead My brother
Because of this bitch

Travis points his gun at Wade

( )

TRAVIS
Dont question me Hes dead Im
sorry We got to move

Wade is frothing at the mouth as he turns to Luke

WADE
Dont touch me you crazy bastard
I never wanted you here in the
first place

He shoots Erin a death glance and turns back to his brother
Erin slowly gets to her feet the gravity of the scene
sinking in

Dustin starts laughing

TRAVIS
Something funny to you Dustin

DUSTIN
Yeah it is This is such a
metaphor of your life Travis One
frickin car wreck to another

WADE
Shut your mouth Dustin

DUSTIN
I dont feel sorry for your
brother Wade No one here can
feel sorry for anyone Not me not
you and especially not Travis
Wed all turn on each other for an
extra dollar and you know it

Travis shoves Dustin to the ground

TRAVIS

I take it the crash got you
thinking funny Whatever redeeming
qualities we pissed away in our
lives there is one that has to
remain Loyalty Because without
that were just some kind of
animal

(beat moves closer)
Right now I am grasping for every
bit of it like a desperate man

Dustin brushes off the dirt and stands

( )

DUSTIN
Im not interested in being your
salvation Travis

LUKE (0C)
Here comes John Wayne

They turn to Luke on top of the over turned car he points
down the road Kens SQUAD CAR followed by Harris truck

quickly approahes

TRAVIS
Everyone load up
(re Erin)
Grab her

Luke moves to the others as Kayla yanks up Erin

ERIN
Who are you

KAYLA
Just your friendly neighborhood
bank robbers

Kens car and the truck pull up to a skidding halt They
jump from their vehicles weapons drawn They are joined by
CRAIG STONE young and probably never really sure why he took
this job His uniform unbuttoned sloppy STANLEY VAUGHN is
the new one of the bunch ready for the next step And hes
about to get it

STANLEY
Geezthere they are There they
are The ones that killed Sirom

Harris cocks his shot gun
HARRIS
Stan keep your head Ken you see
anything
Ken is tucked behind his car
KEN
More than four They might have a
female hostage
CRAIG

Damn What the hell we do These
are real bank robbers

( )

Harris takes a breath his men looking to him He moves to
his CAR MOUNTED BULLHORN

HARRIS
This is Sheriff Harris Zeff Throw
out your weapons and release the
hostage Lets keep from shedding
any more blood

Behind the over turned SUV The crew wait huddled for
orders from Travis Their attention drawn to the new threat
Dustin spots a WAD OF CASH and grabs it He then takes a
beat and moves quietly to the mountain edgeand
disappears

KAYLA
Theres only four of them

LUKE
Thats a nice truck too Toyota
with an eight inch lift

TRAVIS

Guess we could use the ride

(beat touches ear phone)
Hey CharlieHow much is it
Okay buy two thousand shares then
Listen got to go

(looks at the cops)
Okay lets try not to hit anything
but the cops

And then they begin to unload

Bullets bounce off of the hood of the car and truck as the
local law hits the ground

STANLEY
Theyre shooting Theyre
shooting

Craig drops behind his truck
CRAIG
Stan you got a damn knack for
stating the obvious
Ken returns fire The chain reaction begins and bullets are

flying everywhere Harris begins to fire with his shot gun
which takes pieces off of the SUV

( )

Behind the SUV Wade takes a quick look around notes the
missing Dustin

WADE
Travis Dustins gone

Travis looks the area over frowns
As the cops continue to fire Harris throws his hands up

HARRIS
Seize fire

Ken watches or more appropriately listens carefully
Harris gets back on his bullhorn clears his throat

HARRIS (CONTD)
Listen up We dont want any more
getting killed What do you say we
talk

No response

CRAIG
What are they waiting for Should
we keep shooting

KEN
Sheriff

Harris takes a breath then looks into the cab of his truck
and sees A DUSTY KOREAN WAR MEDAL hanging from the visor
Next to that a photo somewhere in the 1950s of Harris and
his WIFE A past long gone

He takes a breath and moves forward into the street his gun
held high

CRAIG

Sheriff What are you doing
HARRIS

Cover me
KEN

SheriffwaitDamn

Ken quickly takes up another position covering as Harris
moves across the road vulnerable in the open

( )

Harris tries to maintain his breathing tapping into an
ancient instinct He looks to the other car into the
windshield No reflections

He pops around the overturned car and seesnothing
Theyre gone He quickly moves to the edge of the road and
looks down

The open range dwarfs the small group of robbers as they
vanish into the dense trees below Harris catches his
breath

HARRIS
Theyre in the timber

The men move over to him quickly looking over the small
perimeter Craig is pumped

CRAIG
Wow Wow We got ourselves some
real damn bad guys

STANLEY
Should I get Gary on the horn and
get back up

HARRIS
Tell him we need everyone Make
sure that Eli closes up the
Hardware store and brings all his
rifles out here

Stanley moves off

footsteps out doing each other with noise He finally

tall trees above him He smiles Free at last

eyes scan the green wall around him Nothing He moves a
further

EXT FOREST 1 - DAY

trees It is obvious that none of this is indigenous to any
of them They are in new territory Kayla maintains close
contact with Erin then turns to Wade

KAYLA

loser

Eli moves through the trees he looks to the ground spotting
the tracks conspicuously in the mud A cocky grin crosses
his face as he ties a YELLOW MARKER to the tree
ELI
You dumb fools Walking yourselves

right into the mouth of Satan

SNAP

( )

Something in the forest Eli spins his reflexes still good
He presses up against a tree watching the foliage for any
movement His NOSTRILS FLARE smelling something that
doesnt sit right with him

After a moment of silence Eli stands and then makes his way
after the robbers but his senses now on Def Con 2

Eli ties another MARKER to the tree and continues on when
once againhe stops

The trees around him giving no sign of what may have caught
his attention He looks as confused as we have seen this old
coot

Then a SOUNDnot a branch not the windbut something
like a deep deep strained BREATHING Eli cocks his gun
moves ahead

As he raises his head over some bushes his eyes begin to
widen like nothing we have ever seen before Something
amazing going on in front of him making him shake like a
little boy

Then the SOUNDA SMALL ANIMAL CRYING

ELI (CONTD)
My godThis cant be

We see the walky clutched in his startled hand and then
something moves BEHIND HIM

EXT RIVER BANK - DAY

Travis looks to the ground noting A LARGE HOLE leading down
to the water below He motions to it

TRAVIS
Wade cover this

EXT RIVER BANK —- DAY

Dustin disheveled and tired moves to the water where he
bends down and begins to slowly rub his hands in the water
watching the dirt and grime flow from his finger tips He
pulls them out and begins to caress it over his face
cleansing what filth he can from himself

He lets his eyes settle on the river bed as the ripples flow
away and his face begins to take shape in the reflection He
stares a moment at himself shakes his head

DUSTIN
Well never be clean enough

Then Dustin takes a whiffsomething irritating his
nostrils

( )

As he takes a sigh his gaze still on his reflection the

water instantly fills with a new configurationone that
passes Dustin menacingly

Dustin turns his gun out Nothing there He then moves on
through the river

EXT RIVER BANK —- DAY

Harris Ken and Craig show up at the area where the bridge
was Harris leans against the tree taking in some much
needed breather Craig holds up the walky

Craig takes a couple steps and what follows is simultaneous
Craigs foot steps right into the covering over the hole and
begins to go injust As Ken grabs his arm preventing the
inevitable fall

Craig looks down swallows Ken then lets him go as he
regains his footing and turns to Harris who is leaning a
against a tree Ken moves to him and Harris stops him

against a tree Luke spins out of Wades grip and takes him
down

Kayla smiles enjoying the show as the sound of combat echoes
in the valley

As the group enjoy their moment of relief Erin moves back
slowly in the bushesand bolts

EXT FOREST 2 - DAY

Erin moves through the trees as fast as her legs will carry
her Twigs snap below her feet branches slap against her
face Her muscles pound into the dirt like an Olympic
sprinter and then

A BROWN MASS Crosses in front of her

She stumbles hits the ground Erin rolls over her eyes
darting around where the intruder just was Nothing Her
heart beats through her chest

Footsteps She turns Luke catches up to her his gun in
hand

INT GAS STATION - NIGHT

Raquel moves back and forth between the dining room and the
kitchen Some great dinner made by hand

( )

She is setting two places In the background the screen
door between her and the great outdoors

As she passes it maybe a third time what was once not there

now is A large figure silhouetted by the moonlight

something huge in its hand Raquel jumps She then
relaxes

RAQUEL
Dadwhat are you doing out there
Suppers ready

The figure opens the door and a shaft of light catches
Chases face On closer look we see a strong face
handsome His lips smile but something in his eyes is not so
happy

Raquel pours some wine

RAQUEL (CONTD)
Make sure and close that screen
door the mosquitos are terrible
right now

Chase nears the table smiles

CHASE
Smells good As always

RAQUEL
Well I learned a few things right
from Mom and this is one of them
Where you been anyway

Chase takes a seat grabs a fork

CHASE
Was up on the mountain

Raquel stops looks to his father and then to the dark shape
laying on the porch

RAQUEL
Why were you out there again daddy

She moves slowly towards the screen door staring at the
large object

CHASE

Just checkin for traps Poachers
still wandering around there

( )

RAQUEL
Daddywhat is that

She gets to the door and notes the BODY OF A LARGE BUCK
laying outside

CHASE
Deer
RAQUEL

broke

Raquel moves back to the table

RAQUEL
Whyd you bring it back here
CHASE

Raquel sighs

RAQUEL
Look him over
(shakes her head)
Just taking a scientific curiosity

Chase gets a bit worked up

CHASE

some bunch of kids thats all

She smiles touches his hand

RAQUEL
Dad there are a lot of mysterious
to life Some you can explain
some you cant Moms death you
are just going to have to explain
because the longer you keep it a
mystery to yourself youll never
stop looking

( )

Chase bites his lip she has hit a nerve He delicately
touches her back but holds the other force deep inside

INT JACKSON HOUSE - NIGHT

Chase moves through the living room stopping by a window
Next to him is a bookshelf a CB RADIO CACKLES on the shelf
Chase looks over his shoulder and realizing hes alone he
reaches behind a ROW OF BOOKS and pulls out a small book and
begins flipping through it Then the radio grabs his
attention

RADIO
ee eee This is Deputy Stanley
VaughnWe just saw the first
flarestill out in the woods

PeakWe need those choppers by
morning

As Chase listens Raquel steps in from behind startling him

RAQUEL
Sorry daddy

CHASE
Its okay You can startle your
crazy old man anytime

RAQUEL
I dont think your crazy daddy I
never did I just didnt like
leaving the door open in our lives
for other people to think that way
Whatever you saw that day whatever
was on that tape doesnt matter to
me You put us on the map Youre
a good man and its not right
having everyone we pass in the
street lookin at you like you

promise I wont drag you into
anything like that again

She smiles nods

RAQUEL
Okay well night daddy

( )

CHASE
Night sweetheart

She steps back into the hallway and Chase looks out the
window his mind racing He drops the book on the window
sill and quickly moves off

We finally get a good look at the book and see SASQUATCH
FICTION OR FACT The ominous image on the front grabbing our
attention

EXT FOREST 2 - DAY

The group pushes through the trees Erin and Kayla walk side
by side Kayla smirks

KAYLA

tough girl attitude down to a
whisper

LUKE
Pee break

Travis stops

( )

TRAVIS
Alright lets take a minute

Luke moves off Erin watches him go as he turns back to her
and winks Then something grabs her attention

A PEBBLE lands near her arm She looks around trying to

figure out where it came from Then it happens again This
time she turns her head behind the trees and sees

Ken His finger pressed to his lips He beckons her to move
away

She takes a beat and slowly casually starts to move from the
camp

Luke stands over the bushes looks down and stops in his
tracks

Below him qun aimed straight up is Harris

LUKE
Aw hell

TRAVIS (0C)
Hurry it up Luke we need to get a

move on

HARRIS

LUKE

Travis looks up suddenly very alert at Lukes response He
looks to Kayla

TRAVIS
Grab the girl

Kayla moves quickly towards Erin Erin sees this and moves
towards her backpack grabbing it just as Kayla nears her

Thats when the first shots ring out at Kaylas feet
She suddenly dives for Erin both of them hitting the ground

Craig rises up shooting towards Wade as the crook dives for
his gun Travis opens fire

Luke drops into a back roll out of Harriss immediate sight

HARRIS
Hey

Harris is on his feet now shooting

Kayla yanks Erin further back into the forest

Travis grabs the bag of cash

Wade pulls back as the area is torn up around him

Luke goes for his gun over by the treeJust as Kens boot
comes down on it Luke sighs and relaxesthen explodes
upward taking Ken against a tree The gun falls from Kens

hand and the two men engage in a vicious street brawl
throwing each other around in a frenzy

At one point Ken as Luke pinned against a tree and a noise
almost sounds like a GROWL grabs both their attention

They pause a beat but Luke is the first to recover fighting
back once again

EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT

Harris moves through the woods his breathing heavy He
charges ahead focused

EXT FOREST 2 - NIGHT

Luke and Ken continue to fight when Craig appears his gun

LUKE

Craig holds the flare above his head cocky

CRAIG
Damn straight

As he twitches to set the flare off

WHAM The world explodes What can only be described as

The

some HUGE BROWN MASS plows through Luke sending him

literally flying into the trees His body hits the branches

tangled upside down

Craigs scream rips through the air as blood flies across
Lukes face Luke eyes flutter open catching a fleeting

inverted image that paralyzes him

A brown hairy mass seems to tear the cops body in two

Then the world turns black

EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT

Kayla moves on Erin and dives for her at a run The two go
down Erin does her best to take Kayla out but the robber
is an over match Kayla rains a couple punches down on her
and puts her into a choke slowly closing down on her wind
pipe

KAYLA
I always hated those well to do
snobs that think life is going to
always be there just for them
Well guess what No one owes you
nothing

Erin throws her head back knocking Kayla from her neck
Erin rubs her throat stares at the dazed Kayla her eyes
burning

ERIN
You dont even know me bitch

Click A new sound

TRAVIS (0S)
Okay okay Enough of this
hostility

They turn to see Travis and Wade guns in their hands now
standing behind Kayla

Before Erin can stand she is suddenly swept off her feet by
something Ken The cop tackles her into the bushes
Before the three can register what is going on

HARRIS (0C)
Drop the weapons

Travis and the others turn Harris stand off to the side his
rifle trained on the robbers The older officer is breathing
heavy
HARRIS (CONTD)

Enough is enough Lets just put

Travis clutches the money tightly not about to run yet

Ken pops up with his gun

( )

As the group of robbers face off across the field from their

would be captors astrange OUT OF FOCUS SHAPE begins to
materialize behind them

TRAVIS
You boys are out of your league

KEN
And you are out of your element

WADE
Youre all out of your head

Erin peers through the bushes and notes the new form moving
behind them Ken now has begun to take notice of the dark
figure and his eyes widen

KEN
Whatis that behind you
Travis smirks
TRAVIS

Are you kidding me
Then the LOUD BREATHINGit grabs the attention of Kayla

who turns slowly her eyes finally resting on what stands
behind them

The others turn and the darkness comes to life

THE GIANT SIMIAN FACE OF SASQUATCH ROARS ITS INTRODUCTION

Shrouded in the dark the eight foot tall creature is still
an ominous sight And then it charges

As the beast closes in on them Travis finally aims and fires
as the three of them move out into the field

Ken grabs Erin and turns to Harris

KEN
Move

The men move down the hill the trio of robbers not far
behind them

Harris turns and fires as the dark beast moves from the dense
trees There is a ROAR and then the monster is gone

EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT

The group move quickly down a hill barely stealing glances
behind them out of fear of what they might see They move
through the forest as fast as they can stealing quick
glances back occasionally as the sounds of trees snapping
continues behind them

Erin turns and sees

A WOOD CABIN old un-cared for

She quickly turns and heads towards it

ERIN
Come on

The group pushes quickly towards it
INT CABIN - DAY

The group blast through the front door seeking solace in
between its flimsy walls Wade slams the door shut

They all move to the windows

TRAVIS

KAYLA

A moment of pause and then their current situation comes back
into play Travis spins his weapon at the cops

TRAVIS
Okay drop em

Harris and Ken are quick with their own draw The Mexican
stand off

HARRIS
Dont do this Put ‘em down

( )

TRAVIS
No cowboyI asked first

WADE

HARRIS

(to Harris)
Now look this is going to get us

HARRIS

KAYLA

Travis Not now no way

KEN

TRAVIS
(agitated scared)

KAYLA
(feeling the strain)
What the hell was that

KEN
Look we can help with this

WADE
Oh yeah You going to go talk to
it for us

Erin still pressed against the wall looks out the window in
the kitchen

Something LARGE moves quickly through the bushes

( )

She walks towards the window crossing behind Harris in the
line of fire Everyone slowly turns to her almost reading
her thoughts

ERIN
Its out there

CRASH A ROCK barrels throw the window flying past Erins
head destroying a STACK OF SHELVES

Wade FIRES out the window Harris throws his hands up

HARRIS
Hold it Hold it

The shooting stops Everyone remains quiet waiting for what
is to follow

KAYLA
What is out there

Wade looks to Ken

WADE
Well Go on talk to it

Travis takes the moment and seizes his opportunity He spins
his sights on Erin

TRAVIS
Okay folks time to settle this
right now I dont shoot the nice
lady and we can all make it out of
here okay

Wade and Kayla do the same all three weapons trained on a
single target

Harris and Ken look to each other

EXT FOREST 2 - DAY

Luke hangs upside down from the tree branches Blood streams
down his face his eyes shut The CRACKLING OF TWIGS brings
him slowly back to his painful life His eyes look around
blurry as the MUZZLE OF A SHOTGUN pokes him in the face

Chase leans his head in

CHASE
Well you are still alive

( )

LUKE
Helphelp me

CHASE
Sure

Chase grabs his shirt and yanks him downhard
EXT FOREST 2 - MOMENTS LATER

Luke looks across at Chase who sits on a rock his shotgun
across his lap the barrel still pointed at Luke The blood
runs down Lukes hand

LUKE
Howd you find me

CHASE
Not too many gigolos out here
(beat)
What are you doing hanging around
in that tree

Luke becomes more alert as it all starts to come back to him

LUKE
Look whatever the hell that thing
was its still out here

Chase tightens

CHASE
Thing

LUKE
Yeah I dont know what it was A
weird gorilla

This grabs the older mans attention

CHASE
(looking for some
reaffirming)
Weird gorilla

LUKE
(mumbling)
Thought gorillas were only in
Russia or someplace

CHASE
You sure it wasnt a bear

( )

LUKE

I dont know bears that wellBut
it didnt look like one I mean
it hit me like a damn truck

(lifts his hand)
I think it bit me

(concern)
Im not going to turn into one of
them am I

Chases face grows alive as he looks the area over
CHASE
Thats a werewolf
(beat excited)
Where was it How big

Luke stands trying to get his bearings points

LUKE
Over there somewhere

Chase prods him

CHASE
Lets go

Luke moves forward staggering

CHASE (CONTD)
Hurry up

LUKE
HeyI just got my ass kicked
give me a break

Chase forcefully sticks his rifle into Lukes gut

CHASE
Your lucky I dont take you out
right now You killed a police
officer and Id have every right to
gun your miserable self down Had
himself a family

Luke looks as if this may effect himjust a bit

LUKE
I tried to knock him out

CHASE
Stop here

( )

Luke stops as Chase scans the area bends down to check the
tracks and the blood His face lights up

CHASE (CONTD)
(sotto)
I knew it I always knew it
(beat)
But what are you doing

LUKE
What did you say

Chase looks back to Luke

CHASE
You stumble on to this thing
feeding or something Threaten it

LUKE
Threaten it Let me tell you
something there is nothing that
could make me threaten that thing

Chase nods his face shows it all

CHASE
Tell me where your friends are
headed

INT CABIN —- NIGHT

WE MOVE with Ken ACROSS the quiet living room until we see
Erin and Harris seated on the couch gun-less He joins
them

Travis is seated at the fireplace the warm glow lighting the
room Kayla watches the windows

TRAVIS
SoCan one of you two fine
gentleman tell me what the hell is
out there

Everyone in the room is quiet Maybe unsuremaybe too
afraid to speculate

TRAVIS (CONTD)
Some help you all are Well its
nothing that cant be cured with
enough bullets

( )

WADE
Were going back out there

KAYLA
Were going to have to sometime
No pissed off bear is going to
stand between me and my money

HARRIS
Seems nothing stands between you
all and your money Some people
have strange loyalties

Travis notes this key word

TRAVIS
Meaning

HARRIS
Just what it is son Life is all
about loyalty Question will
always be where do you place
yours

Travis smiles at the older man

Travis is

TRAVIS
You are a pretty smart ol guy
arent you A lot going on
upstairs in that head of yours

HARRIS

Aint no more in here than in yours
partner Ive just been making the

right choices

locked into this guy now something between them

TRAVIS
Whose the one staring down the
barrel of the gun

HARRIS

Is that your criteria for the right

choice

Travis stands uncomfortable

TRAVIS

We are going to need you two to get

us safe and sound to the Canadian
border

( )

Now its Harris’ turn to laugh

WADE
Whats so funny

HARRIS
You lookin for Canada huh Well
I would say you were a hell of a
lot closer to it this morning But
somewhere a long the way you
started walkin back to our fine
little village

KAYLA
What A circle

TRAVIS
How much

KEN
Well take us about ninety minutes
at a slight jog to be back in town

BUMP Something upstairs Everyone shifts their focus
Travis motions to his two partners The group pulls back
from the stairwell their guns trained on it in grasped in
their shaky fingers

Harris Ken and Erin eyeball the stairwell

KEN (CONTD)
Give us a gun

TRAVIS
Shhh

Something moves down the stairsapproaching cautiously
Everyones eyes trained on it whenLUKE STEPS OUT

LUKE
Heythanks for leaving me back
there

TRAVIS
Damn boy

As they lower there guns slightlyChase appears pushes
Luke into the center of the room his qun popping back and
forth between the crooks

CHASE
Drop the guns

( )

WADE
Put it down now

CHASE
Drop ‘em

TRAVIS
We just went through this partner
and Im not about to again You
want to get out of here alive be
smart

Luke looks to Erin winks

LUKE
Hey

She shakes her head but is probably still glad to see him
CHASE
Im the only chance you have of

getting out of here alive

TRAVIS
How you figure that farmer Fred

This realization is almost hard for Chase to say after all
these years

CHASE
Because I think I know whats
out there
TRAVIS
Oh yeah Whats your guess
Yeti
LUKE

The Yeti is actually the Abominable
Snowman it lives in the Himalayas
In Tibet it means little man-like
animal

(everyone looks at him

Luke shrugs)
This guy is an encyclopedia on all
that stuff

Travis turns back to Chase all eyes now on him maybe buying
he does have the answers

( )

CHASE
What you have out there right now
is something very powerful very
smart and for some reason he seems
to want you all dead

TRAVIS
How do you figure

CHASE
Because hes been following you a
good four miles and it looks to be
a bit more than curiosity

Travis fidgets with this finding for once they must be up
against a wall

TRAVIS
So you trying to tell me you can
get us safely out of here

Chase laughs at the absurdity

CHASE
I just said Im the only chance you
got

WADE

Travis we cant shoot that son of
a bitch if we dont have guns

CHASE
And you cant shoot if you dont
have arms

WHAM A LOUD METALLIC BANG OUTSIDE

ERIN
Whats that noise

LUKE
At this point it could be a great
white shark

WHAM This sounds more deliberate And thenWHAM The
lights go out The GENERATOR HUM quickly dying out

Ken moves to the window and peers out

EXT CABIN - NIGHT

Ken presses his face close to the glass to see whats out
there

A HUGE FORM MOVES BY FRAME Ken falls back startled
INT CABIN - NIGHT

TRAVIS
Whats going on out there

Glares at him

ERIN
Well since there are no monsters
out there I guess nothing could
have taken out the generator

KAYLA
What It cant be that thing can
it I mean it doesnt have a
brain
(turns to Chase)
Does it

KEN
Got a better idea

SLAM Something heavy and hard hits the front porch
Everyone spins to the door Wham Again the noise Wade
grabs his face looking like hes losing it Wham

Luke jumps up and moves over to Travis taking his sidearm
from his belt Travis looks at him

TRAVIS
You want to check that out

LUKE
(sarcastic)
Im just dying to

They move towards the door togetherslowly Wade and
Kayla aim their guns as steady as they can Luke grabs for
the handle and stops whispers to Travis

LUKE (CONTD)

Let me ask you why are we even
opening this door

( )

Travis just gives him that glare and Luke shrugs turns the
handle The door creaks open everyone tenses

The air outside is cold and still and very very dark
Luke peers outside his gun ready Nothing All is quiet

He closes the door slowly

LUKE (CONTD)
Nothing

Then it happens Elis body flies through the open door
knocking Luke to the ground

Wade fires at them

WADE
Come on Kyle Lets take him
out

TRAVIS
Stop

Travis slams the door backs up Luke pulls out from under
the body and charges on Wade

LUKE
Wade you idiot

Wade sticks his gun on Luke

WADE
I didnt know what it was

Kayla tries not to come unwound

KAYLA
Who is that old man

Chase appears to be at a loss as everyone else

Erin looks to the corner of the room her back pack sitting
unguarded She moves to it quickly flips it open and pulls
out from a small zipper insideA GUN

She charges up to Travis in the commotion and sticks the gun
in his ear

ERIN
I start shooting in three
(cocks gun)
Two

( )

TRAVIS
Okay

He drops his Kayla stares at her a moment and then finally
drops hers Luke snatches Wades from his hands as well
Erin looks at Luke

ERIN
You too lover boy

A moment of stunned silence and he tosses his gun Harris
and Ken go for the guns when Erin

ERIN (CONTD)
Hold it

They stop trying to get this figured out

TRAVIS
Well looks like our damsel in
distress has a dark side

CHASE
You okay there little darling

Erin is shaking Rage nervesbut shaking

ERIN
Oh Im just fine Im real fine
now And why am I fine you ask
Trapped in a cabin with a bunch of
bank thieves with guns and some
angry rock throwing monster

She grabs hold of her quickly tensing fingers

TRAVIS
Easy darlin

Erin looks at Ken and Harris

ERIN
Thats easy Because if you spend
your life doing everything to
please someone else eating the way
they want living the way they
wanteven marrying the way they
want You can feel prettydead

She begins to flick the ring again on her finger dangerously
close to the trigger Luke moves slowly towards her

( )

ERIN (CONTD)

So I go from one man who my whole
life would never show he cared to
nearly marrying another who cared
too much And for once in my life
I just do something for myself and
just leave And look where I find
myself

(beat)
And the funny thing is thats what
makes me feel fine If things can
go from that bad to this worse
then by all means they got to be
able to get a whole fuckin lot
better

Erin looks the group over closely coming back to reality

ERIN (CONTD)
Soyou want to know what I think
If even one of you wants to try and
get out of here and start your damn
life over again rightThen quit
pointing these things at each other
and start backing each other up

Erin tosses Luke the gun
ERIN (CONTD)
Heres your chance lover boy Take
this thing and use it right For

once

Luke slowly almost apprehensively takes the gunHe turns
to everyone takes a breath

There is a tacit consensus in the room as every one reaches
for the guns and slowly pick them up No one points them at
each other this time they just go back to checking the
windows and doors

Erin sits by the fire place staring into the flames

EXT CABIN - NIGHT

The rear door to the cabin opens slowlyHarris sticks his
head out looks around SMALL FLASHLIGHT in his hand

HARRIS
Cant see nothing

( )

Travis and Chase step into the door frame cautiously looking
outside as well

TRAVIS
Cant see nothing Does that
comfort you

HARRIS
Son at my age Im comforted
knowing I am still standing here
talking to somebody

TRAVIS
So at your age can you still fix
that generator

Harris shoots him a glance offers out his hand

HARRIS
Age before beauty

Travis smirks and moves out Harris follows behind Chase
presses himself up against the door rifle ready

Harris and Travis move over to the SMALL GENERATOR along side
of the wall A CABLE has been broken off the dents and
scratches on the generator very apparent They rotate the
flashlight to the side where a LARGE ROCK sits

TRAVIS
How did it know

Harris looks back to Chase who has the same worried look on
his face The sheriff bends down for a closer look at the
damage

HARRIS
Looks pretty clean I think I can
reattach it

He fumbles around with the cable as both Chase and Harris
scan the area closely nervously Everything seems to move
The trees The bushes The night itself

TRAVIS
Hurry up pops its starting to
feel funny out here

Harris finally reattaches the cable reaches around to a
switch and it hits it WHOOMP The generator hums to life

INT CABIN —- NIGHT

Kayla and Luke look around the room as the lights come back
on

EXT CABIN - NIGHT
Travis smiles

TRAVIS
Nice work

And as he light from the cabin slowly illuminates the trees

behind Travis we see the blurry but distinct image of the
giant watching them

Chase sees it first his face in a momentary state of shock
and awe Then he is back on reflex

CHASE
Move it

He shoulders his rifle and fires tearing up the bushes as it
roars in anger Travis and Harris quickly stumble back to
the door as the thing charges

INT CABIN —- NIGHT

The three men move in the door as quick as they can as the
violently moving shape descends on them They slam the door
just in timebacking down the hall their guns trained on
the door

Nothing Quiet once again The pounding and roaring never
comes The three drop to the ground exhausted as the others
file in the shadows of the background silently watching

INT CABIN —- NIGHT

Ken and Wade stand near each other looking out into the
darkness Occasionally they steal glances at one another

WADE
So what are we going to do Just
mope around here like a bunch of
sitting ducks

KEN
Sitting ducks Thats like a
thirties gangster term isnt it

Wade casually waves the gun towards Ken

( )

WADE
Be careful Mr Mountie When the
shooting starts again you dont
want to get caught in front of a
stray bullet

Luke moves from the kitchen looks to Ken

LUKE
Hey

KEN
Hey what

LUKE

You scrap pretty good
(turns to Wade)
Guy hits pretty hard

WADE
Well not hard enough apparently

LUKE
Thanks Thats real nice

Luke moves off spots Erin by the fire

Ken looks to Wade and the two exchange a quick uncomfortable
glance

INT CABIN —- NIGHT

Erin plays with the videotape in her hands An OLD TV near
by Luke stands over Erin stands near her Kayla rolls her
eyes at him He catches this turns to Erin

LUKE
Sounds like youve had a pretty
crappy day

She doesnt answer

LUKE (CONTD)
Hey you made a move You said
screw what everyone else thinks
Im doing this for me Thats
good

She looks to him

( )

ERIN
Oh this coming from the womanizing
bank robber Well thanks for the
moral booster but somehow it lacks
a bit of credibility

This stings Luke but he hides it as well as he can

LUKE
What Like I cant have morals

ERIN
You just cant see it can you Go
look in the mirror Luke But look
real hard past the smile and green
eyes Look at the heartif you
can

Luke tries to find his posture-of-cool again while facing
this onslaught of truth

LUKE
Im past all this okay You dont
want my friendly pick me up thats
fine

He moves away drops into the couch looks to Kayla smiling

KAYLA
Shot down

Luke reaches for a PACK OF SOMETHING on the table Pulls out
a food substance and starts to chew it reacts and looks to
Chase in the corner

LUKE
What is this stuff

CHASE
Freeze dried jerky

LUKE
(takes another bite)
I really want to get out of here

Ken looks at him laughs
LUKE (CONTD)
You know sometimes life sneaks up

on you
(MORE)

( )
NTINUED 2

be a rock star and find that life
has just cornered you in some alley
and the only way out is to fight

Ken shakes his head

KEN
Do you just not realize what you do
hurts people

Chase grabs an ASH TRAY and throws it at Luke who
reflexively grabs it He looks stunned at Chase

CHASE

He knows when something is going to
hurt just like the rest of us He
knows what to do to stop it too
Just like the rest of you

(beat)
Priscilla back at the cafe covered

Luke looks to Erin feeling naked

LUKE
You know what mountain man I think

Luke gets to his feet Ken takes aim

LUKE (CONTD)
I dont owe you an explanation

Chase motions to Ken its okay

CHASE
Noyou dont owe anyone anything
do you But at least right
nowyou aint fooling no one
either

Luke looks once more to Erin his shield down

INT CABIN KITCHEN - NIGHT
Chase takes a seat at the kitchen table trying to peak out
into the night Harris joins him at the table There may be
some estrangement here
CHASE
Im sorry about your officer He
seemed like a good kid

HARRIS
He was

Harris fidgets a bit but remaining focused

HARRIS (CONTD)

I justwell I want to say

circumstances All these

one sheriff

HARRIS

Well okay I11 apologize for

department Its justjust I

Chase stands Its uncomfortable but he can also
understand

CHASE
No hard feelings Harris What are

over some guy speeding through
town he looks up at me and says
with a snicker Hey officer aint

and had a breakdown
Harris looks to him places a hand on his shoulder

HARRIS
I hate to say it but I wish I could
Say you were crazy at this point
(beat looks outside)
But your not

Then to both of their surprise the VOICE OF SARA laughing
begins to drift from out of the living room

SARA (0S)
Grumpy husbandthats what you
are Grumpy stubborn wants to do
things his way full of pride

Chase moves from the table as if in a dream towards the
living room

INT CABIN —- NIGHT

As Chase rounds the corner he notes the TV on the haunting
image of himself and his wife on the screen and the group in
the living room watching closely riveted The tape in the
VCR

SARA
But you know whatyou also
believe in the best in life like no
one I have ever known No matter
how bad times get no matter how
hard you want to resistyou always
find a way to come shining through

Chase stops her words returning to him once again for the
first time in who knows how many years

And then the large image crosses the screen and pulls
everyone at a new attention

Chase grabs a REMOTE on the table and hits the pause The
creatures misshapen form frozen on the screen He places
the remote back down looks to the others

LUKE
What is this thing Youre old
friends with it

Chase looks to the window shaking his head

( )

CHASE
Bigfoot Sasquatch The Mountain
Devil Got itself a lot of names
But kid outside of that
everything I thought I knewwas
wrong

The captive audience doesnt move an inch

KAYLA
Well I dont know about the rest
of you killjoys but I got a
bladder thats been yelling at me
for an hour now

(to Erin)

Come on GI Jane lets go powder
ourselves

Erin stands a bit unsure but follows her down the hall
Luke stands moves to the window

LUKE
I thought these Sasquatch guys ate
berries and crap

INT CABIN BATHROOM —- NIGHT

Erin leans against the bathroom door Kayla is pulling up her

pants the scars running up and down her beautiful legs
Kayla notes Erin is staring

KAYLA
Admiring my beautiful legs See I
dont keep photos of my ex
boyfriend all folded up in my
purse These are all the reminders
I get

She buttons them up and moves to the sink to wash her hands
looking at Erins reflection in the mirror

KAYLA (CONTD)
Thats right We all got our
scars Some of us just wear them
on the inside Cover them up
better with a nice car an
interesting life or a pair of big
tits

Kayla moves close to Erin looks at her a beat

( )

KAYLA (CONTD)
Some of us cant hide them Some
of us have to carry them around for
the whole world to see
Kayla moves out the door

INT CABIN HALLWAY —- NIGHT

Kayla and Erin move down the narrow hallway As they pass a
door

THUMP
Something on the other side The two women stop looking
towards it Erin readies her gun Nothing more Kayla

looks to Erin and reaches for the handle

ERIN
Easy

She turns it slowly and the door creaks open

POV

The two look into the room its darkness hardly inviting
INT CABIN - NIGHT

The others in the living room align themselves to see down

the hall Chase moves closer Wade stands near the front
door

CHASE
What is it
KAYLA
Dont know old timerprobably

nothing

As Chase moves closer those in the living room stand stark
still Wade stands by the front door smells the air

WADE
Theres that stink ag

BOOM The front door explodes forward and Hell follows with
it

The beast bursts into the living room ramming Wade against
the far wall Everyone jumps completely caught off guard
This thing is more vicious than any of us have even imagined

( )

Wade begins screaming in the creatures arms as it pounds him

against the lights

Chase Harris and Ken all try and get a sight on it but the
man in his arms makes it near impossible

TRAVIS
Shoot it

WADE
Help

HARRIS

Waitll he drops him
INT CABIN HALLWAY - NIGHT

As Erin bolts for the living room Kayla takes her chance and
flies through the room and out the window

INT CABIN - NIGHT
Harris tries to get a shot and then

HARRIS
Damn it to hell

He shoots the creature in the leg It roars and spins Wade
smack into Travis who flies across the room Its eyes on
fire it moves towards Travis

Harris sees this and rushes to Travis grabbing him dragging
him out the front door

HARRIS (CONTD)
Everyone out now

Luke spots the cash on the counter and moves for it Erin
pops in the room seeing him grab it He turns to her a

beat then

LUKE
Come on

She runs towards Luke as the rest of them move outside
quickly the beast swatting at them and then returning to the
kicking and screaming Wade

EXT CABIN - NIGHT

The group is outside turning back to the nightmare inside
the house Ken looks to Harris

( )

KEN
We cant let him

Harris is already moving back to the door

HARRIS
Stay there

As Harris moves to the door gun raised the SOUND OF
SCREAMING AND DESTRUCTION suddenly halt The silence is
deafening All look towards the dark house staring back at
them

Ken reaches over and grabs the cash bag from Lukes hand

Footsteps in the trees They all swing to look and see Kayla
moving as fast as she can through the dark

WHAM The creature charges the front door

All the guns open fire Tearing the front of the cabin up as
the beast roars back inside

CHASE
Hold it Hold it

The gun fire stops the SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS TEARING THROUGH
THE HOUSE A GLASS BREAKS Instinctively all look around
the side of the house

LUKE
Dude I think hes back outside

Snap A noise in the cabin again guns trained to the door
instantly And thenWade stumbles out A bloody mess He
collapses to the porch dead as they get

AWHOOQOQOQO0000000000000 A howl that chills everyones blood
off in the distance But not far enough

Harris turns to Travis tosses him a gun

HARRIS
Lets go

The group starts at a run the same direction Kayla vanished
in

EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT

The anxious group plows through the darkness the moonlight
their only guide Their hearts carrying their legs faster
and further than theyre used to

Harris breathes deeply his gasps painful
EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT

Kayla moves quickly through the trees not sure where she is
going and not caring Instincts on auto drive As she
pounds through the mud and earth the sound of crashing trees
grabs her attention

She stops waiting listening THE SOUND AGAIN Her
breathing speeds up the sound too close

Kayla turns to a tree and frantically begins to climb Her
arms grasping for any branch We grit our own teeth watching
her climb Then beneath her Sasquatch appears

EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT
The group stops KAYLAS SCREAMING off in the distance

ERIN
Which way

They all look around tense

EXT TREE - NIGHT

Kayla struggles up the tree The Sasquatch begins to ram
its massive body against the tree Kayla aims her gun un
steadily at the monster and fires off several shots to no
avail And then the gun finally clicks

EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT

As they stand by listening hopelessly Luke raises his shot
gun and fires off a blast in the air The others turn to
him getting the idea and also fire shots off into the air
EXT TREE - NIGHT

The Sasquatch turns for a moment the shots grabbing his
attention Kayla makes some distancebut not enough She
has hit the top of the tree She turns back to see the

Sasquatch now once again focused on her

Kaylas face grows defiant as she spits at the beast

( )

KAYLA
You dont get the pleasure you ass

And Kayla dives from the tree

EXT FOREST 3 - NIGHT

The group are now suddenly aware of the quiet The screaming
and growls no more

Harris his face in immediate pain clutches his chest as he
collapses to the ground Ken turns to him

KEN
Sheriff

The younger cop moves to him grabbing him

KEN (CONTD)
Sheriff Take a breath Come on

Travis watches closely shakes his head Something about
this sight he knows

TRAVIS
Breathing aint going to help him

Ken snaps

KEN
Shut up you ass What do you care

And then in an agonizing moment Harris goes limp his
breath passing his lips in a final wheeze Ken places his
head to the older mans chest He then begins to press hard
on his chest over and over

The others watch feeling the helplessness

Travis takes a deep breath and tosses his gun to Chase
moving towards Harris As he approaches Ken the young cop
grows defensive like a lioness over her dead cub

KEN (CONTD)
Back off

TRAVIS
Cool your heels Gomer Let me in
(beat firmer)
Come on

( )

Ken pulls back sensing that it may be the best thing as
Travis moves over the fallen sheriff Travis cracks his
fingers What takes place over the following dialogue is the
difficult and desperate CPR tactics for a heart attack Its
hard to tell if the tension in his voice is from his action
or his memory

TRAVIS (CONTD)
I was thirteen years old and my old
man could drink an Irish Man blind
Drag me to more beer buddy drinkin
contests than I can remember But
one night he pushed his limit I
new that bastard had let his ego
get the best of him We were
walkin down the docks Chesapeake
Bay I saw him take this big gulp
of air thinkin maybe he was trying
to get some fresh sea salt in his
lungs Then he fell flat on his
face I turned his big bloated
belly over and began beating on his
chest like a drumover and
overscreamin and cryin Trying
to get that rusted heart of his
going I said come on you old
heart Beat you son of a bitch

Then Harris eyes open His breath snapping back into his
lungs as he sits up Travis falls back exhausted from the
effort as Ken moves to Harris

KEN
Harris Thank God

All eyes turn back to Travis who slowly rises as if he never
once broke from his story lost in thought

TRAVIS
--But that old boys heart never
did start beating again
(beat)
Dumb bastard

Travis moves over to get his gun back from Chase who hands
it back gladly

EXT FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT

The group comes to an opening in the trees a stretch of open
field ahead of them

( )

CHASE
This clearing up ahead its
another half mile and were at the
edge of town

They continue to look behind them nervously

Erin looks back to see Luke writing something on AN ENVELOPE
and sticking it into his pocket She frowns knowing there
is cash inside of it from the bag She moves over to him

ERIN
Still have your mind on
priorities huh

LUKE
What are you talking about

Erin realizes as she speaks

ERIN
You know its really not hard to
change if you want to Its only
hard when you really dont give a
damn

She moves off leaving Luke alone once again

Ken is walking with Harris sticking close He turns to look
behind him seeing the dark length of forest they have
managed to clear But he seems to be looking further than
that

Harris moves ahead up to Travis The two men look to each
other nodding

HARRIS
Thank you

TRAVIS
Sure
(beat smiles)
Just dont tell any of my friends

Thats when it happens SASQUATCH vaults from the trees and

blasts into Travis his gun flying from his hand Chase is
knocked to the ground

Luke and Ken charge up firing their weapons into the
monsters back It flinches but is so far gone in its
primal rage they dont slow him down at all

( )

Click Click

Their guns empty The beast turns a menacing face to them
that would freeze the most hardened man It raises its arms
in what can only be taken as some sort of primitive warning

Travis groans at its feet crawls towards the nearby trees
where his gun lies He grabs it just as the thing turns to
him And thenWe hear the CELL PHONE RING Both Travis
and Sasquatch react

TRAVIS (CONTD)
Hello Charlie

The Sasquatch moves to Travis whose face now registers the
inevitable smiles

TRAVIS (CONTD)
Ah what the hell Charlie Sell it
all

Then the giant grabs Travis and slings him into a tree

Kens gun empty grabs for his knife and in a sudden
impulsive moment charges the beast jumping on its back

LUKE
Hey

The thing thrashes around trying to throw the human parasite
off of him

HARRIS
Ken

Luke goes for a log and then

CHASE
Forget it You two cut back
through the trees Keep running
and dont stop

Luke pauses a moment as Chase pulls Harris with him through
the trees back into the forest He fires off a shot at the
beast as it begins to pummel both Ken and Travis The beast
turns to Chase as Luke and Erin slip away in another
direction

IT TURNS TO THEM FANGS GLISTENING

Boom Chase fires another shot and Sasquatch turns back to
the older men moving towards them

( )

Luke and Erin slip further into the bush at a run

EXT ROAD - NIGHT

Erin and Luke tear through the woods their hearts racing as
fast as their feet They approach a dark clearing the trees
opening up

Bam Bam

The sound of gun fire stops them They both listen the loud
voices and growls in the distance

CHASE (0C)
Hah Come on

Bam
Then its quiet CRICKETS The wind
WHOOMP A TRUCK DRIVES by them Its huge carcass of metal

passing by at seventy miles per hour The two jump They
look to the ground and see the cement

They are on a road They turn to the truck yelling But it
continues down the road the light slowly dissolving into the
dark and then its gone

ERIN
Damn it

And then the two look to each other realizing the CRICKETS
are no longer chirping They turn to the woods the LOW
BREATHING suddenly audible The hot steam becoming clear in
the trees They step back slowly watching

Luke turns to look at Erin catches the look on her face We
see the change in his eyes

LUKE
(whispers)
It would have been nice

She turns to him

ERIN
What

LUKE
Just start running and dont stop

( )

She looks at him maybe sees the change in his face Luke
grabs A STICK on the ground snaps back to her

LUKE (CONTD)
(yelling)
Just go

She does her feet carrying her down the road Luke turns to
the dark form taking shape in the trees and charges

LUKE (CONTD)
Come on big boy

He charges into the darkness Erin turns and sees as the
arms reach out from the blackness and carry Luke up into the
air She stops

ERIN
Luke

Slam Like a car hitting you at 50 mph hour the SOUND of
Lukes breath leaves his body in an explosion The SOUND OF
FLESH HITTING BARK over and over It is hard to tell where
the crunching noise is coming from

Erin is unable to leave him behind

ERIN (CONTD)
Hey Stop Im here

Lukes limp body sails out of the trees onto the cement

Erin begins to move to him whenthe giant steps forward
onto the road He moves over to Luke reaches down and
touches him Luke groans but offers no resistance

Then the Sasquatch turns to Erin and begins moving slowly
towards her

CHASE (0C)
Erin

She turns surprised to see Chase and Harris limp their way
from the trees Chases gun now trained on the simian They
move to her as it closes in on them agonizingly slow

Chases rifle remains focused on him

CHASE (CONTD)
Well come on then

( )

But then something begins to happenthe creature begins to
slow moving at an exhausted walk His head begins to drop
his once vicious snarl slowly replaced by a softening face

That is when we notice the trail of blood he is leaving
behind His wounds from the battle leaving their mark on the
cold cement

As the three step back the giant then turns slowly toward
the tree-line and drops to his knees still trying to move
forward He no longer seems to want to get them he just

wants to movesomewhere

It crumples to the ground a sigh of breath escaping from
its collapsing lungs Its long arm reaching for the trees
as if to touch them one more time

The three watch as the giant loses its battle to life Erin
moves over to Luke cradling him

And then with one final groanthe Sasquatch dies

The two men move towards it cautiously
Luke looks up to Erin blood coming from his mouth

LUKE
Thatthatwas intense

She nods stroking his hair lightly

Thenanother NOISE catches all their attentionin the
forest Chase raises his rifle as the trees part

ANOTHER SASQUATCH

Harris Chase and Erin freeze

This one a female lighter in color The face of the new
comer turns to them it’s expression a calm that we have not
yet seen on one of these animals

After a beat she pulls her gaze from the smaller invaders
and moves over to the fallen one She smells him twice and
then lets out a noise that could only be a sigh of pain

She knows her mate is dead

She then grabs the fallen body and slowly begins to drag her
mate back to their green world

At the trees it stops one final moment the dead creature
cradled in its arms and turns to Chase Chase returns the

look to this new one and we now feel that we may have been
somewhere like this once before a long time ago

And thats when we notice the BABY SASQUATCH on her shoulder

Its small newborn arms wrapped around her neck grasping her
fur tightly Its matted hair still wet from its recent
birth

Chase lowers his rifle Harris lowers his head and Erin holds
back what may be a tear as they all come to realize who have
been the real invaders here

With one final breath mother and child step back with the
fallen father and disappear into the darkness of the timber

Lukes eyes return to Erin

LUKE (CONTD)
Reachreach in mypocket

She reaches in careful as he flinches from the pain She
pulls out the large bill fold of cash in the envelope

LUKE (CONTD)
I made a lot of promisesFor
once I wanted one to be more than
just a promise
Erin nods knowing what he means

ERIN
I guess even a guy like you has
something good going on in that
heart of yours

He smiles faintly

LUKE
Even a broken watchis right
twice a day

She smiles then turns sees Chase and Harris watching them
Harris sighs looking up as if he didnt see a thing

Erin looks back to Luke who is now obviouslygone

Harris reaches for his walky places it to his mouth

( )

HARRIS
Stanley You there Over

A beatand then a very excited Stanley pops on the walky

STANLEY (0S)
Holy Moley Sheriff Is that you

HARRIS
Yeah its me

STANLEY (0S)
Uhsorry for the language but its
good to hear from you sir Where
are you Over

HARRIS
Not sure son but its a heck of a
lot better than where I was before
EXT ROADSIDE - DAY
Stanleys truck and Chases tow truck sit off the side of the
road Harris Erin and Stanley carefully place Lukes coat
covered body into the back

Off to the side Chase with his arm wrapped over Raquels
shoulder stares out into the forest

STANLEY
(re Luke)
That one of the bad guys

Harris looks to the body and then turns back to his deputy
hands him the bag of money

HARRIS
No Thats one of the good guys

Raquel looks to her father

RAQUEL
What happened out there

Chase takes a beat thinks He hugs her tighter
CHASE
I got a lot of making up to do with

you

He pulls her across the street as they move towards the
others Stanley turns

( )

STANLEY
Whatwell what happened
Waswas it a bear or something

Harris looks to Chase who watches amused for once on the
other side of the fence

HARRIS
Yeaha bear or something

STANLEY
Damn

The younger cop moves off as Harris shoots a final look to
Chase

CHASE
Join the club Sheriff

Chase and his daughter move off towards their truck

Harris turns back to see Erin who stands at the far end of
the street

Erin looks down to see the envelope in her hand A smile
touches her lips as she reaches down and pulls the ring from
her finger

ERIN
Someday Someday when I want to

And then she hauls the ring off into the distant sky Witha
sigh she looks to the beautiful horizon ahead of her

EXT DINER - DAY

The sun bathes the mountain side with fresh new warmth

In front of the diner from the opening scene is Priscilla
sweeping the porch the routine she has done most of her
life

A RENTAL CAR pulls up into the lot stopping shy of the
front WE FOLLOW THE FEMALE LEGS as they move towards the

hard working waitress Priscilla turns to see Erin approach

ERIN
Hi

( )

PRISCILLA
Hi there

ERIN
Are you Priscilla

PRISCILLA
Thats me

Erin reaches into her purse and pulls out the envelope

ERIN
I have something for you

PRISCILLA
For me What is it

Erin hands it to her

ERIN
A whole lot of hope
(beat)
Dont ever let it go

Erin moves back to the car as Priscilla looks to the envelope
and reads the note from Luke on it

ENJOY THE RIDE TO YOUR FUTURE - LUKE

She opens the envelope and sees the huge wad of cash Her
jaw drops as she sits on the porch stunned

She looks up to see Erins rental car pulling away down the
dirt road The dust swallows the car in a cloud and we hear
a strange sound that may be THE DISTANT SCREECH of
tiresor maybe something else

THE END
