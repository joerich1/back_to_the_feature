towards the car The zombie begins banging on the window

bottles and begins banging on the window with it It cracks
and shatters and Barbra screams

and chunks it at the zombie’s face It explodes yolk
covering the zombie’s face She grabs another one and
smashes it on the zombie’s head and smears the yolk around
his cheeks

the time to wipe it on her blouse and she resumes screaming
at the zombie Finally she gets the dead bird that had

and “ouch” He looks up and sees a yellow warning sign that
says “SMALL PLANTS”

and they rip off the zombie’s pants leaving him in his
boxers

boxers and leaving him butt naked The zombie continues to
grunt out the words “oh no” and “ouch”

Brenda holding the stuffed animal with the knives above her
head

INT BRENDA’S HOUSEKITCHEN — DAY

Brenda walks towards the island in her kitchen Above it
are sharp cooking knives including steak knives and shish
kabob spears There are metal poles at the corners of the
island counter that rise up to the hooks where the cooking
knives are connected to

She grabs a bag of chips and is too lazy to walk around the
island to get the popcorn so she leans over the island to
reach for it Her boobs get in the way and the island
begins to shake a little making the poles wiggle and
loosen the cooking knives

INT BRENDA’S HOUSELIVING ROOM - DAY

hanging above Brenda’s head Cindy stares at it longer and

Cindy pulls into the parking lot and gets out She walks
next to the school and looks at her watch Sighing she
walks over to a nearby bench and sits down setting her
purse beside her

She reaches inside her purse and pulls out her makeup
accidentally knocking her purse to the ground Her camera
falls out and the flash goes off

CINDY
Oops

She picks up the camera and quickly turns it off She
continues to put make up on her face

Behind her is a jungle gym A few crows begin to land on
the jungle gym and soon the whole gym is covered with
crows

The power lines above Cindy begin to get occupied by the
birds and soon hundreds of crows surround her Cindy looks
at her compact mirror and sees the crows behind her on the
jungle gym

She closes her compact and lowers it looking at all the
birds around her One crow squawks at her and walks up next
to her

CINDY
Hi there little bird

She puts her hand out to it and the crow bites her finger
She screams and brings her band back Another bird bites
her leg and Cindy gasps The birds close in on her and
Cindy tries backing away

Suddenly a large white glop falls next to her She looks
up at all the birds in front of her As if planned all the
birds let out their droppings They rain down on Cindy
covering her in the white feces She screams as the white
feces splatters on her

The school bell rings and all the birds flutter away
leaving black feathers caught in Cindy’s blonde hair

Kids come running out of the school doors and CODY much
older about 12 or 13 walks out solemnly Cindy walks up
to him and kneels down

CINDY

with her car and the man flips over the top and lands a
few feet behind her

CINDY
Oh my God I just hit that
hobo
(Unbuckles and opens door)
Stay here Cody

She gets out of the car and Cody watches eagerly
EXT CAR — DAY

Cindy walks over to the back of her car and sees the man
lying motionless on the road She inches near him and bends
down examining his body

She gasps and backs away a little A siren fades in and she
looks up noticing a large fire truck coming down the road
its lights flashing
The man now a zombie suddenly sits up his eyes a milky
gray and his clothes tattered Cindy begins jumping up and
down waving her arms trying to get the driver’s attention

The zombie is about to grab Cindy’s legs to bite but he
looks up and is hypnotized by Cindy’s bouncing breasts as
she jumps up and down

The zombie sits there drool soon leaking out of his mouth
cascading like a waterfall The fire truck passes her car
She watches it drive away and walks back to her car the
zombie still staring at her

INT CAR — DAY
Cindy gets in the car and sees Cody looking at her camera
CINDY
Cody why are you looking at

my camera

She takes the camera from him and looks at the picture he
was on It’s the picture of her when she dropped her camera
and it flashed when she was on the bench The wires
connected to the telephone poles run through her head

Cindy stares at the picture a little longer and finally
she turns it off and drives off

INT OFFICE ROOM —- DAY

Martin is sitting in the front row of dozens of other

loud commotion and the Mayor finally pounds his gavel on
the counter and everyone quiets down

MAYOR VAUGHN
Officer Martin Grody will
step up and give us what you
got

Martin looks at his fellow citizens and walks up behind the
Mayor He stalls for a moment and shuffles with a desk
flag

MARTIN
Well it appears we have a
shark swimming in our waters
and I just wanted everyone to
know that this shark is
dangerous and has already
killed one person

The group of people whisper to each other
MARTIN (CONT’D)

I just wanted to tell you our
plan so far

MAN (0OS)
What about the beaches
Chief
MARTIN

We’re going to put on the
extra summer deputies as soon
as possible And then we’re
going to put shark spotters
on the beaches
COUNCILWOMAN

(Impatient)
Are you going to close the
beaches
MARTIN

Will you let me finish I’m
getting to that

He pauses for a long moment

MARTIN
We have to close the beaches
to do this

The group of people begin to argue A man sitting next to
the Mayor stands up

OLD MAN
For only 24 hours

MARTIN
(Surprised)
I didn’t agree to that you
old hag

MAYOR VAUGHN
We’1ll keep the beaches closed
for only 24 hours and we’ll
open them back up even if
the shark isn’t caught

MARTIN
What the hell I didn’t say
that

OLD WOMAN (0OS)
24 hours That’s like 3
weeks

There is a loud screeching sound and everyone looks behind
them SQUINT an old chubby man with matted gray hair and
stained clothes brings his nails down on the chalkboard
over a drawing of a shark eating a person the person’s
head is detached from the body
Squint continues to bring his nails down the chalkboard
but soon his fingernails start to come off and Squint
screams

He holds his hands tightly and someone hands him a white
cloth and he holds it tightly around his fingers Blood
begins to soak into the cloth

SQUINT
I’1l1 catch this bird for you
but it ain’t gonna be easy
Its not like going down to
pond chasin blue gills or
tommy cots or Mayor Vaughn’s
drunk wife This shark won’t
suck but swallow you whole
But it’s not going to be
pleasant—like Mayor Vaughn’s
wife when she’s drunk—but I
value my neck a lot more than
three thousand bucks Chief
I’1ll find him for three but

himfor ten

MARTIN
Ten thousand Squint we
can’t afford that kind of
money

SQUINT
No ten dollars and I’m

myself Yes I know I’ma
selfish bastard but for ten
dollars you’ll get the head

Cody snatches it front her He growls and snarls at her and
quickly runs away

CINDY
Time for his pill again

She walks over to the pantry and pulls out a monstrous
bottle of Ritalin She twists the top off and pulls out a
large pill about the size of a person’s thumb and breaks
it in half

She walks into the living room and grabs her plate with
cake crumbs on it Cindy walks to the sink and begins
washing it when the reflection in her window is engulfed
by a black entity
She gasps and turns around catching anything that could
have caused the black entity She turns back around and
then entity disappears quickly

She looks over her shoulder again and the entity appears
again Quickly turning around it disappears She looks
over her shoulder a few more times and each time the
entity appears and each time she looks back it
disappears

Finally she shrugs it off and fills up a glass coffee cup
with water She sets it on the counter and walks to the
fridge As she looks at the contents in the fridge the
glass coffee cup cracks and water begins to leak out

The water drips off the counter and onto an electrical
socket with a blender cord sticking halfway out of it

Cindy walks back to the blender with various fruits in her
hand She begins throwing in grapes pieces of apple and
peaches She is about to peel a banana when she stops and
looks around

CINDY
Wait there’s something
missing

As she looks around she glides her hand up and down the
banana and the movement gets quicker as she gets more
impatient

CINDY
Ah Strawberries

She sets the banana down and opens the fridge pulling out
a container full of plump strawberries She throws a few in
and unpeels the banana snapping it in half and dropping
the two banana ends into the blender

The doorbell rings

CINDY
Cody can you get that

She sets the top on the blender and flips the switch but
the blender doesn’t start She flips it on and off and
looks at the plug
Oblivious to the water dripping on the plug she pushes it
in and the blender kick starts sparks shooting from the
plug

Cindy’s hair immediately stands straight up and she begins
screaming Her body shakes and vibrates and more sparks
shoot out of the socket

Her body is blown back from the socket and she flies across
the kitchen and into the living room

INT LIVING ROOM — NIGHT
Cody walks in and sees Cindy flying towards him

CODY
Cindy someone’s here to—

Cindy crashes into Cody breaking her fall Cody flies back
and hits the wall Above him a shelf breaks and books
begin to fall on him hitting him on the head

When he thinks it’s over he looks up and a huge thick
Webster’s Dictionary falls over and slides down the broken
shelf landing on Cody’s face

Cindy gets up rubbing her head In front of her stands
ALEX FROWNING with short dirty blonde hair spiked up at
the front He is wearing a black leather jacket over a
brown collared shirt with khaki pants

CINDY
Oh hi Alex

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

They walk into the kitchen Cody is about to take the other
half of his broken pill and Cindy pulls out her cake

ALEX
Hey Cody happy birthday

Cody smiles Cindy cuts Alex a piece and hands it to him on
a paper plate He smells it and his face scrunches up due
to the horrible smell
CINDY
I think something is
happening to me and my friend
Brenda

Alex is about to take a bite of her cake but takes it
away afraid to touch it

CINDY (CONT’D)
I mean I’ve been getting
this feeling ever since we
left the theme park that
something bad was going to
happen to us I’m scared
Alex

Cody swallows his pill with the rest of the water left in
the cracked glass cup and begins choking on it Alex sees
Cody in distress and sets his plate of cake on the counter

ALEX
Uh oh Cody’s choking Let me
help him

He runs over to Cody and begins doing the Heimlich maneuver
on him

CINDY (CONT’D)
I mean first her house burns
down and then I almost get
electrocuted to death I just
don’t know what is going on

The second half of the pill shoots out of Cody’s mouth He
breathes heavily and Alex pats him on the back

ALEX
(To Cody)
Cody can you go to your
room

Cody runs to his room and slams his door

ALEX
So how are you and Cody
doing
CINDY
Cody and I haven’t really
bonded much and I try and
spend time with him I mean
ever since his mom died and
all he’s been secluded in
his own little world

ALEX
Whatever happened to Tom

CINDY
I don’t know The last time I
heard him he said he was

working in someunderground
lab where they study viral
weaponry

ALEX

Oh really Well I hope he’s
doing fine

There’s a brief pause and the both shuffle around

ALEX
Well I better get going I
don’t want to stay too late

CINDY
Oh no No no no stay

ALEX
Are you sure

CINDY
Wellthe truth is I’ve
been busy with a lot of
stuff I mean I can barely
hear my own thoughts Cody is
still peeing up and I
haven’t even gotten Tivo yet
(Beat)
I just need someone to be
with right now

ALEX
(Smiling)
Okay I guess I could stay a
little while longer

They embrace Alex caresses her hair and his facial
expression turns from love to “weirded out” when he
accidentally pulls out a clump of Cindy’s hair He quickly
throws it off to the side

INT CINDY’S ROOM — NIGHT

Cindy and Alex sit in bed separated by hundreds of photos
Alex looks past Cindy and at her window A man stands
there watching them Alex gives him a thumbs up and the
man returns with two thumbs up Alex turns to Cindy

CINDY
I think what is happening to
me and Brenda has to do with
the pictures we took at the
theme park

ALEX
What do you mean

CINDY
Well take a look at this one

She shows Alex the picture Brenda holding the stuffed
animal with the sharp objects above her head and the bright
lights surrounding her

CINDY
Look above her head I was at
her house some knives almost
fell in her head but they
missed her

ALEX
Well it’s probably just a
coincidence

CINDY

No it couldn’t be Her head
almost got chopped off by a
fan blade also

ALEX
No Cindy that happens to
everyone It happened to my
mom last week

CINDY
Oh oh I’m sorry

ALEX
No she had it coming anyway

CINDY
Oh

(Beat)
But also in this picture the
bright lights they symbolize
something also like fire or
something She almost got
electrocuted and her house
caught on fire

ALEX
Look it’s probably all a
coincidence like I said

CINDY
I want you to look at another
picture

She pulls out the picture that she got of herself when
sitting in front of the jungle gym She shows it to Alex
and points out the telephone pole wires

CINDY

(Beat)

(Normal talk)

thumbs up to his friend His friend gives him a thumbs up
but he is a zombie His mouth is open and he has a bite
mark on his neck

EXT HARBOR - NIGHT

It’s dark and foggy with boats in the harbor and the dock
is covered with dew Martin drives up in his police vehicle
and steps out

Getting out of the passenger side is MATT HOOPER with a
large brown bushy beard and small glasses They walk down
the dock

MATT
A shark was caught earlier
today

MARTIN
Is it the shark that killed
the girl the other day

MATT
Well that is why we’re here
I don’t think we have the
right shark

They walk up to a large Tiger Shark hanging by the tail on
a rope Matt pulls out a large knife and begins cutting the
shark open

MATT
(Struggling)
We start in the elementary
canal and open the
digestive tract Just like
I thought

He guts it open and milk pours out

MATT
Milk

He throws out a few tiny milk cartons He pulls out a fish
head and throws in front of Martin He then pulls out a tin
can It bounces down the dock

MATT
Tiger sharks are like garbage
cans They’1ll eat anything

He throws out a toilet lid then a broken sink a whole
suit of armor and then a bowling ball He throws the
bowling ball away from him and it hits Martin in the
stomach

Martin grunts and grabs the bowling ball flying into the
water Matt falls back and begins breathing heavily

MATT
Just as I suspected
MARTIN
(Climbing out of water)
What

MATT
(Holding a license plate)
A license plate He came up
the gulf streamfrom
southern waters

MARTIN
He ate a car

MATT
Yeah look closely in the
stomach The car is in there

Martin looks in the stomach of the shark A small car
about four feet long sits in the middle of the stomach

MARTIN
That’s a car

MATT
Yeah you know one of those
little clown cars that can
fit about seven clowns Look
you can even see one of the
clowns still in there

Martin looks inside the car but there is no clown in
there

MARTIN
There’s no clown in there—

He turns around and sees the clown eating the brains of
Matt Martin gasps and stares at the zombie clown The
zombie clown stops eating Matt’s brains and pulls out salt
and pepper shakers

He puts a dab of salt on Matt’s brains and pours all of the
pepper into Matt’s head He continues eating the brains
Martin slowly backs away from the zombie clown towards his
car and the zombie clown sees him
The zombie clown pounces on Martin and attempts to take a
bite at his neck Martin screams and keeps the zombie
clown’s head back He squeezes the zombie clown’s red nose
on accident and it makes a bike horn sound

Martin stops screaming and the zombie stops attacking
Martin squeezes the zombie’s nose again and it makes the
bike horn sound again Martin begins to laugh and soon
the zombie clown laughs also

The zombie clown gets up and begins squeezing its nose
laughing and doing a little dance Martin stops laughing
and slowly walks away to his car

He gets to his car and the zombie continues to squeeze his
nose until Martin suddenly runs into him with his police
car The zombie flies into the water and Martin speeds off

The zombie slowly rises out of the water his facial
expression turns to anger He growls and begins walking out
of the water More zombies begin to walk out of the water
until there are hundreds—-even thousands

take off his shirt In the corner of his bathroom near the
ceiling the little girl from the game watches him

Her eyes get wide and she quietly “oohs” and “ahhs”
pulling out a pair of binoculars and watching him take his
shirt off

The little girl snaps out of it and pulls a blow drier out
of nowhere and jumps down of the ceiling startling Cody
He screams

Cindy and Alex rush in hitting the little girl and sending
her flying into the shower Steam begins to fill the

ALEX
I don’t want to break the
law

Dozens of cars barrel down the street in front of them
swerving into each other and some of zombies clinging onto
them

ALEX

See we could have been
crushed by all those cars I

around her

END VISION

EXT MALL ROOF — DAY

ALEX
Cindy are you okay

CINDY
Yeah I just had another
vision

ALEX

What was it this time

CINDY
We were on a boat I think it
started sinking or something
and I was underwater again

ALEX
I think I know what is
happening Cindy Where’s a
computer

INT RADIO SHACK —- DAY

Cindy and Alex sit in front of a computer They open up the
Internet and they go to a search engine

ALEX
I remember a few years ago
there was a roller coaster
crash involving a group of
students getting off before
it actually crashed

Alex types in “ROLLER COASTER CRASHES” and links pop up He
clicks on the first one

ALEX (CONT’D)
The weird thing is that one
of them had a premonition of
it crashing About a week
after the people who got off
began to die and the girl
who had the premonition
claimed to have pictures that
told the victims’ deaths

Pictures pop up of the people who got off the roller
coaster A picture of a woman modeling for a swimsuit
magazine pops up and Alex’s eyes become wide He right
clicks and bookmarks the picture

ALEX
I’1l save this for
laterbut anyways you said
you had a vision of it
crashing right

CINDY
Yeah

ALEX
Explain it to me in full
detail

CINDY

Well we were on that ride
where you sit in the giant
teacups and spin around in
them right Well that is
when things started to get a
little weird

FLASHBACK

INT TEACUPS RIDE - DAY
Cindy and Brenda wait in line for the teacup ride Brenda
turns around and faces Cindy

BRENDA
Oh Cindy this is so fun I’m
having so much fun

CINDY
Well with Cody at his camp
I decided to spend a little
time out of the house

Cindy and Brenda begin getting on the ride A little kid

runs over to a measuring board where a teacup caricature

holds its arm at a certain height Cindy watches the kid

measure himself Above the teacup is a speech bubble and
the teacup is saying

“You must be this high to die”

Cindy shakes her head and smiles getting on the ride
Cindy sits in a teacup with Brenda On the other side of
the ride Jeff and Laura get in a teacup Next to them
Stacey and Michael get on one

Cody gets in a teacup with his friends but Cindy is
unaware that he is there Alex gets on the ride and Cindy
spots him

CINDY
Alex Alex over here

BRENDA
This is going to be great

Alex waves and he sits down in the same teacup as them A
woman walks up to Cindy and taps her on her shoulder

WOMAN
Excuse me ma’am you dropped
this

CINDY

Oh thanks
The woman hands her a piece of paper and walks away Cindy
opens the paper Written in thick bold letters it says
“You’re gonna die”

ALEX
How are you Cindy

CINDY
Huh Oh I’m fine

The ride begins rotating and everyone begins spinning their
teacups around Brenda controls their teacup and begins
spinning it really fast Cindy and Alex try hanging onto
the sides

Stacey begins to do seducing moves while rotating the
teacup to Martin Martin sits back watching her “work” the
teacup

Cody and his friends begin spinning their teacup to fast
and hard that the rotating handle pops off and their teacup
begins spinning out of control It randomly explodes

Brenda begins going crazy and spinning their teacup too
fast also

CINDY
Brenda Brenda Stop

Alex tries holding on but can’t He flies out of the
teacup landing on the ride operator breaking the control
panel The ride begins breaking apart Cody also flies out
of his teacup flying onto the ground

He gets up but is immediately crushed by an obese man who
had tripped over himself

The passengers scream as everyone begins flying out of
their teacups Cindy and Brenda try stopping theirs but
it’s spinning too fast

The wind blows off Stacey’s shirt and the sight of her in
her bra makes Martin have a heart attack Laura flies out
of his teacup but grabs onto Jeff’s hair He screams and
hangs on for dear life as Laura pulls his hair out

She screams and flies out of the park flying towards the
water Before she splashes in the water Jaws jumps out and
snatches her in the air “Blood” begins floating towards
the surface but then a Tomato Soup can floats up along
with a plastic bowl and fork

Underwater two scuba divers are having a picnic on the
ocean floor

Jeff’s teacup flies off the ride with him in it She falls
on the ground and the teacup lands on him his head popping
off like a Barbie doll’s A girl the same girl who caught
the severed hand at the beach walks past the ride when
Jeff’s head falls in her stroller She picks up and jumps
for joy hugging the head

Stacey sits on the rotating handle screaming Suddenly
the handle pops off a bouncing spring She flies through
the covering of the ride and falls back towards the ground

Two ninjas fighting randomly in the middle of crowd look up
and see Stacey falling towards them One of them is holding
a sword and he screams as Stacey falls on him his sword
piercing one of her breasts deflating it

Cindy and Brenda cling onto each other as they’re the last
ones left on the ride Their teacup tips over and they fall
out sprawled across the floor A metal pole falls out of
nowhere and spears Cindy in the stomach She screams and
looks over at Brenda who is being crushed by another
teacup

CINDY
Brenda I think you’re going
to die before me

BRENDA
I know Hurry up

Cindy dies and Brenda gets crushed so hard her eyes pop out
to worm-like things Her eyes lift up and she looks around
then behind her

BRENDA
Hey I can actually see better
this wayIs my butt really
that big
Brenda dies and Cindy wakes up sitting in the teacup with
Brenda Everything is normal like it never happened

BRENDA
This is going to be great

The woman walks up to her handing her the paper

WOMAN
Excuse me ma’am you dropped
this

Cindy opens it up and it says the same “You’re gonna die”
She begins hyperventilating

CINDY
We have to get off of here
This ride is going to crash
Everyone’s going to die

ALEX
Cindy What are you talking
about

CINDY

The ride’s going to go out of
control everyone’s going to
be killed Let me out

BRENDA
Cindy what are you smoking
because I want some of it

CINDY
Get me off

She jumps out of her teacup pushing a girl out of her way
The girl falls down throwing her stuffed animal in the
air Cindy pushes a woman out of her way the woman
spilling her food all over herself

Before Cindy reaches the exit she pushes a scientist out
of the way the scientist splashing acid on his face He
covers his face screaming in agony
Stacey Martin Laura Jeff and Cody get off with Cindy
Brenda and Alex Cody runs up to Cindy

CINDY
Cody what are you doing
here

CODY

This is where our camp was
going this year

ALEX
Cindy what happened

CINDY
I saw the ride crash
Everyone died We have to
stop them before it’s too
late

But it is too late The ride begins and Cindy watches in
horror Suddenly everyone begins flying out of the ride
and the ride catches on fire

Cindy watches the ride get destroyed Behind her people
run around screaming some on fire some with missing
limbs Other rides catch on fire also and the whole place
turns into chaos

END FLASHBACK
INT RADIO SHACK — DAY
Cindy stares off into space and then looks at Alex

CINDY
And that’s what happened

Alex is sitting in his chair reading a book He looks up
at Cindy and takes his feet off the counter and sets the
book down

ALEX
Oh is the flashback over
(Beat)
Wait so what you are saying
is that when we got off that
ride we’ve been dying in the
order we were supposed to

CINDY
I think it’s going backwards
I saved Brenda from dying
then Cody blocked my path
when I was about to fly into
the wall

(Beat)
And I saw how we were going
to die in the pictures I took
at the amusement park

She pulls out her camera and hooks it up to the computer
The pictures pop up on the computer and Cindy starts going
through them one by one

CINDY
(Looking at Brenda’s picture)
Well we already saw Brenda’s
picture But why would I die
when she was supposed to

ALEX
Maybe death skipped her
moving to the next person who
was supposed to bite the
dust

CINDY
And Cody stopped me from
dying so that means it had
to skip me too

ALEX
Well who’s next

They flip through the pictures and come to a picture of
Brenda hugging Bugs Bunny Behind her Stacey is clearly
seen surrounded by fire screaming They continue looking
at it

CINDY
This is impossible I can’t
tell what is going to happen
to her
ALEX
Do you thinknah

CINDY
What What is it

ALEX
I was going to say Bugs Bunny
might eat her but we all
know he isn’t real

CINDY
»Or is he

They look at each other terrified
EXT MALL ROOF — DAY

Stacey walks onto the roof brushing off her clothes and
straightening her hair She walks up to Laura

STACEY
Hey Laura you want to come

tanning salon on the first

LAURA
Oh well thanks for inviting

STACEY

LAURA

She gives Jeff the phone number and he looks at it
carefully He smiles and puts it in his pocket and watches

Stacey walk away She turns around and mouths

“call me”

She turns back around but runs into the closed metal door
leading to the second floor of the mall Brushing herself

off she opens it and walks away

LAURA
Dad what would you be doing
right now if Mom wasn’t
killed slowly and painfully
by those cannibalistic
zombies that won’t die unless
you shoot them in the head
because they’re dead

JEFF
Wellprobably be spending
more time with her and
ignoring you completely even
if you were dying

(Beat)

Now if you excuse me I have
a number to call

Jeff gets up and walks away and Laura pouts

She looks up

and sees Troy sitting in a lawn chair staring at her

stares back and smiles looking away

She looks back and he is still staring at her smiling

walks over to him and sits down on his lap As she sits

down she farts and he becomes disgusted

LAURA
Sorry I had Mexican food

TROY
Ugh why is it warm

Troy shifts uncomfortably but looks back at her

TROY
So how have you been

LAURA

She grabs a handful of gravel from the rooftop and
layfully throws it at him lightly He laughs and grabs
ome gravel and throws it at her

nd

n

he returns the love by throwing more at him harder
hough He begins to take it seriously and grabs to
andfuls chunking them at her

Dc

She falls to the ground and he gets up kicking more gravel
at her She covers her face as the gravel hits her and she
tries talking but rocks fly in her mouth

EXT TANNING SALON - DAY

Stacey walks towards the tanning salon She stops in front
of it and checks her arms

STACEY
Fifteen minutes should do

She walks inside and turns on the lights

INT TANNING SALON —- DAY

She walks towards the tanning beds grabbing a bottle of
liquor She walks over to a CD case and pulls out a CD and

looks at the cover It says “Tanning Bed Death Watch
out”
She puts it in a CD player and takes off her shirt and
pants leaving her in a tight swimming suit She climbs in
the bed and closes the top She begins listening to a song
and moving to the beat

INT RADIO SHACK —- DAY

Cindy and Alex flip through more pictures one picture pops
up of a list At the top of the list it says “Death List”
with the names of those who got off the teacup ride Cindy
passes through it without second though

The light above them begins to flicker and they become
worried

INT TANNING SALON - DAY

Stacey takes a chug from her liquor and continues moving to
the song Outside of her tanning bed the voltage setting
is at 115 But it begins rising all the way up to 200

Stacey begins breathing hard sweating She wipes the sweat
off her forehead and begins rubbing her glistening body in
slow motion

She decides to get out and begins pushing the top up But
it won’t open She begins banging on the top trying to get
it open

She continues to try to open the wrong side of the tanning
bed To the left of her on the top of the tanning bed it
says “Push this side to open”

She screams and her skin begins to darken and burn She
looks at her arms and legs and screams even louder

STACEY
I didn’t want this dark of a
tan

She grabs her liquor bottle and begins banging on the top
of the tanning bed trying to bust it open The bottle
crackles and it finally breaks liquor pouring over her hot
body She slowly wipes it off and starts kicking around in
the bed
INT RADIO SHACK —- DAY

Cindy and Alex continue looking at each other The light
above them shatters sparks falling on them Alex looks at
the picture of Stacey burning in the fire

ALEX
Oh my God

CINDY
What

ALEX
A sign

She looks at what he is pointing at Alex is pointing at a
billboard in the amusement park advertising for something

CINDY
I think Stacey is going to
die by fire or something

INT TANNING SALON - DAY

Stacey continues to scream as she burns up in the bed
Suddenly her belly begins to swell

STACEY
Oh God I shouldn’t have
eaten those Peeps for lunch

Her whole body begins to inflate like an inflatable raft
her skin squeezing through the small spaces of the tanning
bed

EXT TANNING SALON — DAY

Cindy and Alex run to the tanning salon Everyone from the
roof run up with them hearing Stacey scream

BRENDA
Oh my God I think she’s in

raining down on them

INT FOOD COURT - NIGHT

Everyone sits at a table while Cindy stands in front of
them her arms folded across her chest

CINDY
Okay everyone something
really serious is happening

kiddie ride we had destroyed
Death’s plan Now we are
dying one by one in the order
we were supposed to

LAURA
Oh my God

CINDY
I know it’s pretty bad

LAURA
What Oh no my friend just
texted me saying her
boyfriend broke up with her

CINDY
The only way we can save each
other is by intervening
somehow But when we do that
it skips them and moves to
the next person on the list

JEFF
Well what are we going to do

ALEX
(Eating Peeps)
Well we don’t know for sure
but there has to be a way

Suddenly the lights go out and everyone screams and gets
up Cody turns on a flashlight and they begin to calm down

HERALD
There are generators in the
parking garage We can go
turn them on

BRENDA
(Under her breath)
Hm I’d like you to turn me

on
ALEX
(To Cindy)
I’1l be back soon You stay
here
CINDY

Okay be careful

Jeff Herald Alex and Martin run off towards the parking
garage

CINDY
(Looking around)
Where’s Cody

INT FURNITURE STORE - NIGHT

Cody walks past beds neatly made and chairs set perfectly
to make a tiny room that couples would kill to have in
their tiny homes

He walks over to a miniature room including a bed a
closet a dresser a few toys and a toy box along with a
desk with a large mirror in front of it

He jumps on the bed and lays down on it getting
comfortable He climbs under the covers and sighs in
relief having the bed to himself
Suddenly something moves in the mirror to his side He
looks over and sees nothing in the mirror A squeaking door
turns his attention to the closet in front of the bed
Inside the closet are clothes hanging on their hangers a
few on the floor

A dark figure moves about in the closet causing Cody to
cover himself with his covers He slowly reaches his hand
out onto the desk next to the bed and begins searching for
something

A hand comes out off screen with a flashlight and gives it
to Cody He pulls it back under the covers and turns it on
Seconds after he turns it on it begins to flicker and
shuts off

Cody begins breathing hard and he slides the covers off of
him He sits up and stares at the closet A growl is heard
within the closet and he looks deeper into the darkness

Suddenly he is sucked under his covers and is pulled out
of the bed and dragged into the closet the door slamming
shut

Just as the door shuts Cindy walks into the miniature
bedroom oblivious to what just happened

CINDY
Cody Cody are you in here

The closet door opens and she walks over to it She looks
inside but sees nothing but darkness and clothes She walks
in and pushes the clothes out of the way Soon Pine Tree
branches begin to come in her way

She pushes them out of the way but some slip and smack her
in the face She runs through the Pine Trees more and more
branches smacking her face She begins screaming and
finally she jumps forward landing in soft white powder
snow

INT NARNIA — DAY
She looks up the snow falling down on her Pine Trees

covered in snow seem to have a towering effect She gets up
and brushes the snow off of her
FAUN (0OS)
Why hello there

Cindy steps back terrified

A FAUN walks up to her a scarf wrapped around his neck and
he is carrying a bag of objects over his back

FAUN (CONT’ D)
I was just about to go home
for tea Would you care to
join me I love having tea
with friends Then we can
dance and sign and run around
in the snow

Cindy still terrified looks around her and finds a fallen
tree branch She sings the branch like a batter and hits
the faun

The faun flies back and hits a tree landing in a pile of
snow He looks up his eyes turning to hatred

FAUN
You bitch

The faun gets up landing in some ninja position Cindy
does the same lifting up her arms

They jump up onto the Pine Trees and begin fighting on the
branches Cindy pulls out a sword and gets ready to
compete The faun pulls out a frying pan looks at it and
throws it away from him He pulls out a tiny dagger and
growls

On the forest floor Cody kicks snow in the air searching
for Cindy He keeps calling her name when the frying pan
hits him in the face knocking him into the snow

Cindy and the Faun begin jumping over each other doing
almost impossible moves The faun stops and sticks his
dagger into his belt and pulls out a horn

He blows it the noise echoing through Narnia Cindy
watches and waits Suddenly birds come out of nowhere and
begin attacking her pecking at her face
The faun jumps towards her his dagger in his mouth ready
to strike She jumps out of the way just in time and the
faun catches himself on one of the tree branches

Cindy accidentally drops her sword and it falls to the
ground She looks around for something to fight with and
sees a bird feeder hanging from one of the branches She
grabs a handful of birdfeed and throws it in the faun’s
face

He freaks out and falls off just as Cody climbs to the top
of the tree The faun falls on the ground Still alive he
looks up and the dagger falls into his chest

Cody sticks out his tongue and catches snow on it

CODY
Cindy look It’s snowing

One of the birds flying above him poops the white
substance splattering on Cody’s face getting in his mouth
He falls off the tree towards the faun

The faun screams but comes to an abrupt stop as Cody lands
on the knife the knife handle going up his butt Cody

tries letting out a scream but is in too much pain to make
a sound

Cindy jumps from the tree and lightly lands on the ground
She walks up to Cody

CINDY
Come on Cody let’s get out
of here
CODY
(In pain)

I don’t think I can

Cindy pulls Cody up He falls on her and they fall back
into the closet

INT FURNITURE STORE — NIGHT
Laura walks towards the miniature bedroom She hears

banging on the closet door and walks over to it She opens
the door and Cindy and Cody fall out gasping for air
LAURA
Oh my God what happened to
you two

CINDY
(Close to crying)
I don’t know

Laura pulls out a handful of pictures and shows them to
Cindy The one of Jeff is on top

LAURA
You left these at Radio
Shack

CINDY
Thanks

The picture is of Jeff and Laura together Jeff smiling and
looking off somewhere else and Laura having a handful of
food and drinks she looks like she can’t hold it all

A metallic object is in front of Jeff separating his top
half from his bottom half

CINDY
Hold on

She pulls out the picture of Death’s list

CINDY
okay so first was Brenda
then me and Stacey after
Death is working backwards
meaning thatuh oh

LAURA

CINDY
Jeff’s next

INT PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Alex and Jeff walk behind Herald and Martin holding
flashlights
HERALD
Okay the generators are on
the first floor

JEFF
This is stupid Some of those
things could be in here We
could get killed

ALEX
Don’t worry We have guns we
can take care of them

MARTIN
Actually we only have one
shotgun shell left

ALEX
We’1l survive

They spot blood on the wall of the parking garage and gasp
A trail of blood leads to a hobo struggling to stay alive
while crawling on the ground He looks over at the group

HERALD
Phew Don’t worry guys it’s
just a hobo

They continue walking They come to the first floor of the
parking garage and stop at a car Herald pulls out a map of
the mall and lays it out on the hood of the car

HERALD
Okay I have this all planned
out Alex you go into the
air conditioning and make it
all the way to the other side
of the parking garage That
is when you meet up with
Jeff where he makes sure the
wires of the generator are
tightly secured After that
Martin is going to go out of
the mall putting is life on
the line with those zombies
out there and makes sure all

the doors are locked just in
case He is then going to
make a daring escape by
getting on a motorcycle
jumping a ramp through a
burning hoop and makes a
suspenseful and slow-motioned
landing on the roof of the
mall where he meets up with
me Us two are going to go
down a chute that leads to
the generators in the middle
of the parking garage where
we flip the switch to turn
the lights back on

The three stare at him and then at each other They look up
past the car and see the generators right in front of them

HERALD
Okay let’s get started
JEFF
Um Herald we already did
it
HERALD
Did what
MARTIN

We did what we were supposed
to in your plan while you
were explaining it All we
have to do is get to the
generators and flip the
switch

HERALD
You mean you didn’t jump
through the chute to get to
them

MARTIN
Well it is kind of pointless
to do that isn’t it

Herald punches Martin
HERALD
You were supposed to follow
by the plan Jesus Christ
let’s just get this over
with

As they walk to the generators the gas tank in the car
cracks and gas begins to pour out slithering towards the
generators

They walk into the generator area when suddenly a zombie
pops up behind them The zombie jumps on Herald tackling
him to the ground More zombies walk down the parking
garage moaning and grumbling

Alex kicks the zombie off of Herald and they run into the
generator area They shut the gates and lock them The

zombie jump onto the chain-linked fence and begin tearing
it down

Martin grabs a gas nozzle from a gas tank and begins
splashing gas onto the zombies The gas from the tank
combines with the gas from the car

Herald grabs Martin’s shotgun and shoots one of the zombies
in the head The zombie pulls the fence down

ALEX
Herald Matches

Herald pulls out a cigarette lighter and flips it open He
creates a flame and throws it onto the gas igniting it
The fire engulfs the zombies and they get off the fence and
run away

The fire spreads across the parking garage and catches the
car on fire Jeff jumps out of the generator area and turns
around

JEFF
Come on before it’s too late

The car explodes sending a piece of metal flying towards
him The piece of car slices him in half His top half
falls to the ground revealing a tiny alien like being
using levers and controls that move Jeff’s legs
HERALD
Oh my God He was pregnant
the entire time

The alien being screeches and pulls out a ray gun Alex
gasps and grabs a tiny rock from the ground He chunks it
at the alien and hits it in the head killing it

INT APPLIANCE STORE — NIGHT
Brenda alone walks around an appliance store looking at

refrigerators and ovens She walks over to a bowl of fruit
and pulls out an apple taking a bite out of it

EXT MALL — NIGHT

A Buddhist zombie walks over towards a door that leads to
the inside of the mall He pulls the door open slowly and
shuffles inside

INT APPLIANCE STORE - NIGHT

Brenda throws the apple up and down catching it in her
head as she chews on the piece of apple

INT STAIRCASE - NIGHT

The Buddhist zombie walks up the stairs his golden chains
and necklaces jingling

INT APPLIANCE STORE - NIGHT

Brenda still chewing on the same piece of apple grabs a
banana and begins to slowly peel it The door behind her
opens and she turns around It’s the Buddhist zombie

The zombie looks up at her and moans Brenda gasps the
piece of chew up apple falling out of her mouth

She sees the golden chains and decorations on the Buddhist
and gasps again

BRENDA
Ooh boy where did you get
that bling-bling
The Buddhist zombie pounces on her She screams and pushes
the zombie off of her and she gets up and runs down the
hallway

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT

She trips over nothing sliding across the floor She looks
back down the never-ending hallway and sees the Buddhist
zombie coming after her She screams and gets up She looks
at her banana and peels the rest of it stuffing the banana
into her face

She swallows it and looks at the banana peel wondering
what to do about it She throws it in front of her and
looks at the zombie

BRENDA
Ha ha Try and get me now
bitch

She runs down the hallway accidentally slipping on the
banana peel

Troy runs into the hallway and sees Brenda on the ground
and the Buddhist zombie slowly shuffling towards her He
pulls out a pistol and begins shooting at the zombie
missing every shot

He accidentally hits a gas pipe and gas begins to shoot
out filling up the hallway Troy realizes what he hits

TROY
Get down

BRENDA
I’m already down

TROY
Well thenstay down

Troy shoots one of the light fixtures obliterating it The
sparks ignite the gas and a giant fireball rolls down the
hallway charring the zombie

Troy dives down onto the floor as the fireball rolls over
him The fire engulfs them burning off their clothes
Supplies such as blankets pillows and tables fly over
them

Troy pulls out a cigarette and puts it up to the fire
lighting it The fireball dissipates and Brenda and Troy
lie in the middle of the hallway with no clothes but a
blanket covering them and pillows beneath their heads

Troy blows out smoke and Brenda giggles

BRENDA
Now that was good

INT FOOD COURT - NIGHT

The rest of the survivors sit at tables while Jeff’s body
lies on the ground covered with a blanket Laura is quietly
sobbing behind everyone else

ALEX
We have to start thinking of
a plan for when we have to
get out of here One of those
things has already broken in
and we don’t want any others
getting in also

CINDY
And we have to watch over for
each other also Two people
have already died since we
got off the teacup ride

CODY
How do we know who’s next

CINDY
Oh I have the list right

Just as she pulls it out of her pocket it spontaneously
combusts into flames She screams and throws it in front of
her where it is reduced to ashes

CINDY
She passes the

It’s been a few weeks since they’ve been in the mall and
thousands of zombies have gathered up outside

Everyone is reinforcing the buses putting up barbed wire
on the tops shielding the windows and taking seats out of
the buses

Alex throws Herald a few tools including hammers nails
screw drivers and wrenches Herald begins having trouble
catching them and Alex begins throwing larger items He
gets to propane tanks and he chunks one at Herald throwing
him to the ground

Laura spray paints graffiti on the buses as Troy and Cindy
help put netting on the windows

Once they are finish they group together and look at what
they’ve finished

ALEX
We just need a few more
boards on top and we’ll be
finished

INT BATHROOM - DAY

There is loud farting and a lot of splattering sounds They
slowly stop and the door opens revealing Martin He looks
down and pouts

MARTIN
Damn it I missed again

He closes his eyes and tries to relieve his stress by
breathing in and out deeply He walks out accidentally
slipping on his crap but catching himself by grabbing onto
the stall door

He hears a noise in another stall and slowly walks towards
it He swings the door open and his eyes get wide

In the toilet lies an Alien egg Martin observes it and
begins walking towards it

MARTIN
Man I wonder what that person
was eating

He walks up to it and stares down at it The top four
flaps suddenly opens each flap folding back He looks
inside and a snake-like creature moves around in it

He takes a closer look when a FACEHUGGER jumps out
latching onto his face He flies back out of the stall and
begins thrashing around trying to get it off

He falls forward landing in his crap in the stall he was
in

INT HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Cindy Alex Laura and Troy walk through the aisles of the
hardware store looking for the right equipment for the
buses

TROY
Okay so let me get this
straight Death is coming for
us because we “ruined” his
plans when getting off the
ride So basically we
cheated death and heor
sheis playing a fair game
killing us off one by one by
the rules

LAURA
Like a game How

TROY

Well I guess Death is
looking at this like a game
to where we are the players
We control our lives and
Death controls his own Sort
of like Death invented the
game he invented the rules
and wants us to follow them
making sure that we die in
the order we were supposed to
and if we cheated death he
is going to work his way

around to still get us
killed

CINDY
By knocking the person who
cheated to the bottom of the
list

TROY
Exactly But what would
happen if the person who had
the premonition or just
someone out of the ordinary
on Death’s list died when
they weren’t supposed to I
mean that would screw up
anybody’s plan right

ALEX
You could be on to something
here

TROY

I know So any takers

As the other three talk a tiny breeze rolls over Cindy
She looks back and sees wind chimes slowly swaying side to
side as if some wind blew it but there is no cause of the
wind

Above them wooden stakes sit dangerously far out over the
shelf to where they are about to fall Right under them
stands Laura

Cindy and Alex walk off and Troy and Laura stand in the
same aisle real close to each other They begin to kiss
passionately when the wooden stakes above them shake

Cindy pushes a cart full of supplies they need as Alex
walks besides her

CINDY
So is he saying that one of
needs to die to stop this

ALEX
It’s possible I mean new
life does beat death

CINDY
You mean like having a baby

ALEX
Sure I guess you could say
that

Cindy pops up next to Troy and Laura out of nowhere and
pushes them closer together

CINDY
Hurry it up you guys

She disappears
She returns behind the basket as Alex is looking around him

wondering where she went He jumps when he sees her and
gasps

CINDY
Okay so Plan A is making the
baby

ALEX

What’s Plan B

CINDY
I’m not sure have to—

Cindy stops and looks at a picture of Cindy standing in
front of a game booth Behind her Laura stands smiling at
Jeff while getting ready to play the game

Above Laura’s head there is a sign that says “Yes this is
a sign” and next to it it says with dozens of arrows
pointing down at Laura “She’s next” The arrows look like
the wooden stakes above her and Troy

ALEX
What’s wrong

CINDY
I think Laura’s next
Troy pushes Laura into the shelf gently shaking the shelf
and causing the wooden stakes to slip out inches further
Cindy and Alex run around and Cindy looks up and sees the
wooden stakes

CINDY
There Those

The wooden stakes fall down in slow motion and Laura and
Troy look up in slow motion

ALEX
Don’t worry I was the best
football player in high
school I know what to do
And good thing those wooden
stakes are falling in slow
motion or I wouldn’t have had
time to inform everyone I was
a football player in high
school

Troy backs out of the way and Alex in a running football
player’s position rams into Laura shooting her across the
hardware store before the wooden stakes impaled her

Laura flies into one of the doors opening it up to the
outside world where thousands of zombies wait to get
inside

Laura gets up and brushes the dust off of her She turns
around and screams as the zombies burst through the doors
She runs back to the other three where they run out of the
hardware store

INT HALLWAY — DAY

It’s a different hallway then when Troy and Brenda were
almost charred to death They run down the hallway as the
zombies quickly follow

LAURA
They’ re too fast We need a
distraction

They stop and Alex opens up a door that leads to a freezer
He begins pulling out large chunks of meet and throws them
on the floor Each piece gets bigger until he throws a man
out

The man slides across the floor and the zombies surround
him The four run away as the zombies gather around the
terrified man

ZOMBIE 1 pulls out a large knife and looks at the others
He looks at ZOMBIE 2 holding up the knife

ZOMBIE 1
(Subtitled as he moans and
grumbles)
Do you want the top half or
the bottom half

ZOMBIE 2
(Subtitled as he moans and
grumbles)
I don’t know

ZOMBIE 1
(Subtitled as he moans and
grumbles)
Just choose one

INT MALL — DAY

out of the bathroom rubbing his head He has brown stains

on his shirt

MARTIN

Martin runs through the mall with them They reach the food
court where everyone is sitting relaxed

They all stand up quickly as the five run through the
court knocking down tables

ALEX
Come on They broke in
They run towards the elevators as the zombies slowly walk
through the food court walking around the knocked down
tables

Herald grabs a propane tank and sticks a stick of dynamite
between the handles The stick of dynamite has an extra
long wick and he lights it It sparks and begins moving
towards the dynamite

They get to the elevators and Herald begins punching the up
button He continues to press it as the rest look back

LAURA

The elevator doors open and everyone piles inside at once
but get stuck as they try and get through

ALEX
Hey guys GUYS
(They all become quiet)
We can’t get through here
unless we all work together

They get out and walk in single filed Once they are all
in they begin to panic again Herald punching the second
floor button

The zombies walk around the corner and head towards the
elevator The doors close and everyone begins to calm down

LAURA
That was closer than last

They open the door and jump out
INT BUS 2 — DAY

Everyone is knocked out Martin is the first to wake up He
sits up hot and sweaty and unbuttons his coat Suddenly
he tenses up as something in his chest begins moving
around

He grunts and tries to make the pain stop but it keeps
coming His white undershirt turns red and suddenly a
CHESTBURSTER pops out of his chest blood spraying on Troy

TROY
(Sort of unconscious)
MmmI like it when you
spray that on me

The chestburster screeches as it pops out and it plops on
the ground growling It slithers over to Laura who lies in
the back of the bus

It slithers into her mouth and she begins to sort of suck
on it She opens her eyes and pulls out the chestburster
slowly and looks at it

CHESTBURSTER
(Deep voice)
Baby you and I go together
like a 5-year-old on sugar
Laura’s eyes become wide and she screams
EXT MARINA — DAY

The other four hear Laura scream and they run over to the
back of Bus 2 They open the door and the chestburster
jumps out It jumps into Cindy’s shirt and begins
slithering around

Cindy freaks out and jumps up and down as Laura climbs out
followed by Troy

Cindy continues to freak out as Alex tries and gets the
chestburster out He sticks his hands down her pants in the
front area and begins searching around

ALEX
(Smiling)
Got it

BRENDA
(Holding chestburster)
Um no you don’t I do

Alex looks down at where his hand is and quickly snatches
it out

ALEX
Kill it

BRENDA
No
(Putting it in pocket)
I’m saving it for later

The zombies come into view and begin walking towards the

the dock and getting closer to the boat

INT BOAT - DAY
It’s light out the sun rising over the mall They pull out
of the docks and begin driving away the zombies falling
into the water but most staying on the docks

Suddenly the mall explodes into flames the fireball
rising into the sky blocking out the sun

Cindy walks to the end of the boat squinting her eyes She
gasps and turns around

CINDY
Alex this is exactly what
happened in my vision I
think I know what to do to
save us I have to die

Cindy walks to the end of the boat about to jump off when
Alex stops her

ALEX
Cindy wait
(Cindy looks back)
I just wanted to sayI love
you

Cindy smiles and looks at everyone on the boat Alex
Laura Troy and Cody

The mall explodes in a bigger explosion that sends a
shockwave away from it The shockwave knocks Cindy into the
water and a few zombies fly into the water

EXT BOAT — DAY

Cindy sinks to the bottom of the ocean She opens her eyes
and sees zombies falling in and struggling to get back up
A shadow glides behind her She twists around and sees
nothing

She pulls out a harpoon gun and gets ready to shoot
whatever comes close to her Suddenly a hand touches her
She spins around and shoots the harpoon gun at an innocent
DIVER The diver gags and sinks to the bottom

DIVER
(Mumbled by water)
Oh shit

Cindy drops the harpoon gun and sinks deeper to the ocean

she becomes stuck

She begins to loose oxygen and begins flailing around

her vision

boat The others help her and Alex in as Jaws’s dorsal fin
pops out of the surface slicing through the water

Oh my God shark

to the side a little

Alex bends over Cindy and begins performing CPR Everyone
surrounds Alex and Cindy waiting eagerly for her to wake

ALEX
No she’s going to make it

TROY

ALEX

They begin arguing when Brenda shuts them up

BRENDA
That’s enough All of you
You’ve seen how bad things
could get and how quick they
can get that way Well they
can get a whole lot worse

Cindy coughs up water alive

BRENDA (CONT’D)
So we’re not going to fight
anymore We’re going to pull
together and find a way to
get out of here First we’re
going to make it to that
island in front of us

Suddenly Jaws jumps out of the water and snatches Brenda
bringing his body down onto the boat He lands on a board
of the boat that Cody is standing on Cody shoots up into
the air and disappears into the sky

Brenda gets swallowed alive and whole Everyone tries to
back away but Jaws’s weight keeps them from staying in one
place as the boat begins to go underwater

Suddenly Jaws transforms into a figure dressed in a dark
robe The figure pulls out a scythe and it cleans itself
off It’s DEATH

ALEX
Who the hell are you

DEATH
Who do I look like

Everyone stares stupidly

Everyone still

Everyone still

DEATH
I’m Death

stares stupidly

DEATH
I kill people

stares stupidly

DEATH

(Sighs)
I’m the one who’s been
chasing you around killing
you all one by one this whole
time

They all get it and laugh a little

DEATH
Yeah yeah uh listen you
all won at my game You were
able to cheat death by
getting off the ride and you
were able to beat me at my
own game I guess me sending
you the zombies and creating
chain reactions that killed
some of you didn’t work the
way I planned

CINDY
(Perfectly dry)
Wait you were the one who
raised the dead

DEATH
Yeah all the other techniques
got old so I decided “Why
not do something new”

ALEX
Why did you disguise yourself
as a shark then

DEATH
Well I was killed by a shark
in my early life and
following the rules I had to
be what I was killed by most
of the time

LAURA
One more question Why did
you kill Brenda when first
of all we already beat you
and second of all she
wasn’t next on the list

DEATH
Oh her Well she was just an
annoying mother fu—

Brenda breaks through Death’s bones and clothing His bones
disintegrate along with his black cloak and scythe Brenda
brushes herself off and fixes her hair

BRENDA
I’m alright guys I’m fine

TROY
Brendayou killed Death

BRENDA
(Looking down around her)
Well I did didn’t I

Cody falls out of the sky and onto the boat rocking it a
little He stands up holding his head He walks over to

He lifts up the cooler lid and sure enough a zombie head is
in it They scream and Alex picks it up throwing it over
the boat The head explodes into a million pieces
CUT TO
Troy zooming in on the island with the video camera
CUT TO
They pull up to the island shutting off the boat and
getting off They get on the dock and walk closer to the
woods that lay before them

Suddenly shadows begin moving behind the trees and Troy
backs away with the camera a little bit

CINDY
What is it

Birds come flying out of the woods and begin attacking the
survivors Cindy screams for Cody and Troy focuses in on

from the birds
