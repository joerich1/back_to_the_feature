the surf Racing toward the beach where large bonfires
burn TITLES AND TITLE SONG

THE SANTA CARLA BOARDWALK 2
This is the place where its all happening on warm summer
nights MUSIC and NOISE Arcades Thrill rides A
brightly-lit Ferris wheel turning against a jet black sky
INT CAROUSEL 3
Spinning merrily Loud CALLIOPE MUSIC Young kids and

teenagers occupy the horses and benches A tough group
of SURF NAZIS also ride My Beach My Wave on their
T-shirts

The LOST BOYS enter the carousel house Cool kids in dis-
tinctive dress Compelling not threatening They are
DAVID MARKO PAUL DWAYNE David the obvious leader

GREG the head Surf Nazi sits in one of the carousels

benches with his arm around his girl SHELLY He thinks
hes King of the Boardwalk And doesnt like it one bit
when Shelly casts an appreciative glance toward David

David smiles back at her Not flirting just being chi-
valrous Greg scowls and takes his anger out on Paul by
tripping him as he goes by An insult a shove David
joins Paul Surf Nazis join Greg The Lost Boys close
ranks A major melee seems ready to erupt when the ugly
end of a nightstick is shoved against his Adams apple

A three hundred pound security GUARD is at the other end
The ride suddenly ends CALLIOPE MUSIC STOPS

GUARD
I told you to stay off the
boardwalk

For an endless moment Davids and the Guards eyes lock
in mortal combat Neither one willing to give ground
Then David smiles

DAVID
Come on lets pull

The Lost Boys begin to leave as the Guard turns to Greg
and the Surf Nazis
GUARD
You too off the boardwalk And
dont come back

Greg and the Surf Nazis grumble and leave There is

bad blood between them and the Lost Boys but both groups
hate the Security Guard more

EXT BEACH IN FRONT OF THE BOARDWALK- NIGHT 21

Michael and Sam walk across the beach around the burning
bonfires The beach is crowded Greg and the Surf Nazis
hang out It is all very strange and exciting to Sam and
Michael who make their way towards the lively boardwalk
Sam fusses with his mussed hair and trendy clothes

MICHAEL
Youre beautiful

SAM
Wanna change my hair my clothes
my face

They go up the stairs near the bandstand A LOUD ROCK
GROUP performs The crows and action are exciting
Michael and Sam make their way through the young people

Michael suddenly sees
STAR

A heart-stopping young beauty Different from anyone in
the crowd listening to the music and even though shes
with LADDIE 14 a sweet-faced but sad boy she seems
alone As the MUSIC BUILDS she suddenly feels Michaels
gaze and their eyes meet She is a person looking for a
friend Michael smiles Star wants to smile back but
she cant and reaching for Laddie disappears through
the crowd Michael grabs Sam and follows

EXT SANTA CARLA PIER - NIGHT 22

In view of the boardwalk but quite a distance away

Lucy in a soft summer skirt and blouse walks on the busy
pier restaurants souvenir stores boat rentals etc

A brain dead ex-hippie is preaching ranting and raving
Lucy falls in step for a moment with a TOURIST COUPLE

who are smiling over the ex-hippie

LUCY
I think I dated that guy

The couple chuckle and disappears in the crowd as Lucy
comes across a kiosk with dozens of local ads for apart-
ments for rent fishing boats seminars and many flyers
with missing children Being added to this is a xeroxed
flyer with a picture of the heavyset Security Guard we
saw killed MISSING in large black type over his photo
This is being placed there by his WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN

Lucy passes the sad woman and their eyes meet for a
second Lucy notices a HELP WANTED SIGN in a restau-
rant window As she goes to inspect it however she
suddenly becomes aware of a YOUNG BOY looking very lost
in the middle of the summer crowd

POV OF LUCY 23
tending to the child

This is through a store window looking out onto the pier
with the boardwalk in the distance A BUZZER SOUNDS

AND POV MOVES THROUGH THE DOORWAY OF A VIDEO STORE

as the LOST BOYS enter aggressively

These POVs belong to MAX the tall good-looking friendly
owner of VIDEOMAX a trendy videosouvenier store with
banks of TV MONITORS filled with rock and cartoon images
Max is not happy with the appearance of the LOST BOYS

in his store who seem only interested in causing trouble
and cruising the attractive YOUNG BLACK CASHIER Max is
just about to deal with them when the BUZZER SOUNDS
again and Lucy enters with the child
LUCY
This boy seems to be lost

David and the Lost Boys watch Lucy and the child Max
is delighted to see Lucy in his store

LUCY
I thought maybe his parents
might be in here

Max is just about to help Lucy when a frantic YOUNG
MOTHER comes dashing into the store

MOTHER
Terry Oh thank God I was
so worried

She grabs the child effusively thanking Max and Lucy
Max gallantly hands a lollipop to Terry as the mother
thanks them some more and leaves Max hands Lucy a
lollipop next

LUCY
No thanks

She smiles as the Lost Boys shuffle past heading for the
door Max speaks to David

MAX
I told you not to come in here anymore

David smiles his smile and leaves with his guys Max
sees Lucy watching him

Wild kids

Outside David and the guys get on their bitchin bikes
and peel out

LUCY
Oh theyre just young We were
that age too once Only they
dress better

MAX
Youve got a generous nature I
like that in a person My name is Max

LUCY

EXT BOARDWALK - NIGHT

Michael walks briskly past the rides through the crowds
Sam has trouble keeping up as they turn down an alley

SAM
Where are we going

MICHAEL
Nowhere

SAM
Then whats the rush Youre
chasing that girl why dont you
just admit it Im at the mercy
of your sex glands

MICHAEL
Dont you have something better
to do than follow me around all

Then Sam realizes that hes standing directly in front
of a GREAT SECOND-HAND COMIC BOOK STORE

SAM
As a matter of fact I do

With that Sam walks away from Michael And Michael
continues his search alone

INT COMIC BOOK STORE

Weirdness hangs in the air Sam enters It seems empty
Sam begins to examine the treasure trove of comics when
he suddenly becomes aware of TWO TEENAGERS EDGAR and
ALAN -- tough little dudes in fatigues with cold eyes --
victims of too many Chuck Norris movies They are busy
stacking old comics on the racks from cardboard boxes
They are the FROG BROTHERS

SAM
You cant put the Superman DC
3400 series with the 500s
its a different artist

The Frogs just look death at him but Alan notices
something

ALAN
(to Edgar)
Hes right

They begin to correct their mistake as Sam speaks again

SAM
And these Archies should be over
here with the Richie Richs

EDGAR
Where the hell are you from

ALAN

Alan looks to Edgar as Edgar pulls a comic from the shelf
EDGAR
If youre gonna live around here

be without

He hands Sam a comic entitled Vampires Everywhere

SAM
I dont like horror comics

ALAN
This one could save your life

EXT THE BOARDWALK

with her walking a safe distance behind She becomes
aware of him She looks over her shoulder -- then
suddenly stops

EXT ANOTHER PART OF THE BOARDWALK 28
Michael rounds the turn and stops short

Star and Laddie are surrounded by the Lost Boys Michael
feels upstaged The Lost Boys look his way -- but there
is nothing threatening in their expressions

engines Star climbs on behind David putting her arms
around him

walk spraying sand into the air and REVVING their
ENGINES

People on the beach turn to look as the motorcycles ROAR
by heading for a more deserted section of sand

EXT THE SHORELINE 42
The motorcycles speed through the surf

ANOTHER ANGLE 43
They head for the pier at full speed The thick wooden
pilings present a hazardous obstacle course Michael

SKIDS and slows down

The Lost Boys do just the opposite They increase their
speed as they approach the pilings

EXT BENEATH THE PIER 44
David and the others thread their way between the pilings
at breakneck speed -- executing turns and avoiding col-
lisions in a way that doesnt seem possible

MICHAEL 45
travels through the pilings trying to keep up

EXT DUNE-FILLED BEACH 46
An area of gently rolling sand dunes A bonfire burns

beside one of these dunes We HEAR the THUNDEROUS RUMBLE
of approaching motorcycles and one-by-one the Lost Boys

sail off the edge of the dune -- fly through the flames
of the bonfire -- and land upright on the beach below
MICHAEL

is the last one to try this Hes determined not to
chicken out He speeds up the dune -- flies through the
flames -- and hits the beach He almost falls -- but
immediately rights himself

him a smile The Lost Boys also favor him with approving
looks

David smiles -- and speeds ahead Michael takes off
after him

EXT HUDSONS BLUFF - NIGHT 49

Davids Triumph streaks across the flat surface of the
bluff Michael is not far behind

MICHAELS POV

The bluff terminates in a shear five hundred-foot drop
into the CRASHING SURF below And its coming up fast

DAVID

ROARS toward the abyss seemingly heedless of the peril
that lies before him

MICHAEL

begins to show fear Its as is hes going to shoot off
the edge of the world He brakes and spins out nearly
losing control of his bike sliding toward the edge
DAVID

BRAKES The tires lock and the TRIUMPH SKIDS to a stop

CLOSE ON TRIUMPHS FRONT TIRE

retaliation but David surprises everyone by smiling his

irresistible smile at Michael

DAVID
How far you willing to go Michael

EXT BLUFF FROM THE OCEANS POV 51

A beautiful magic spot David Michael Star and the
others climb down old condemned wooden stairs passing

huge signs on old rusted pilings reading CONDEMNED
UNSAFE UNLAWFUL TO GO PAST THIS POINT The group
presses on toward a LARGE OPENING IN THE ROCKS

INT CAVE 52
The group enters and Michael cant believe his eyes
A VICTORIAN HOTEL LOBBY

has seemingly dropped through a crack in the earth It
is tilted and broken but nearly intact Front desk
lobby mural wrought-iron elevator and more

Shafts of moonlight shoot down from cracks in the ceiling

DAVID

This was the hottest resort in Santa
Carla back about eighty years ago
Too bad they built it right on top
of the San Adreas fault

(beat)
In 1906 when the big one hit San
Francisco the ground opened up and
this place took a header into the
crack

PAUL
Man you wouldnt believe the cool
stuff weve found in here

Michael glances at Star

STAR
Cmon Michael I want to go

Ten oclock Lights out

Lucy opens the closet and throws a few items inside then
walks away

SAM
Mom

She closes the closet door

LUCY

I cant sleep with the closet
door open either Not even a
crack

(pause)
Your father doesnt mind though
It could be wide open for all he
cared I think one of the reasons
I divorced him was because he
never believed in the horror
of the closet monster

GRANDPA (0S)
Closet monster

Taken by surprise Lucy and Sam yelp like a pair of
scared puppies

LUCY
Dad Dont sneak up on people
like that

GRANDPA

Walkin without makin a sound

Grandpa is holding something behind his back

GRANDPA
Brought you a little somethin to
dress up your room with Sam

Grandpa reveals whats behind his back A grotesque
stuffed woodchuck Raised up on its hind legs Teeth
exposed Very ugly indeed

Lucy and Sam hide their revulsion as Grandpa proudly
places the monstrosity on the dresser

SAM
Thanks Grandpa

GRANDPA
Lots more where he came from

LUCY
Lights out Sam

SAM
Soon as I finish this comic Okay

Lucy nods and exits the room Grandpa follows her out
Sam is left alone to finish the comic But he cant
concentrate The woodchuck seems to be staring at him
Finally Sam leaps out of bed grabs the woodchuck and
puts him in the closet SLAMMING the door tightly

Michael is intrigued -- and David sees it He steps
closer to him

Marko suddenly arrives bearing cartons of take-out food

MARKO
Chow time

David takes the cartons from his hand

DAVID
Chinese Good choice

He pops the lid on one of the cartons and approaches
Michael with it

DAVID
Guests first

Michael hesitates

DAVID
Its only rice Dont you like
rice 300 million Chinese people

Michael takes the carton warily and David immediately
turns his back on him passing out food to the others

Michael takes a mouthful of rice using the plastic spoon
provided The others begin to eat as well

DAVID
So how do you like those maggots
Michael

MICHAEL

DAVID

Youre eating maggots How do
they taste

Michael looks at his food
CLOSE ON THE CARTON

A thousand wiggling maggots squirming and sliding over
each other

spits out his mouthful in horror and revulsion and throws
the carton to the ground

But as the carton spills out we see that it is just rice
after all

The boys LAUGH UPROARIOUSLY Michael looks mortified
Star gets to her feet

STAR
Leave him alone

DAVID
Sorry Michael No hard feelings

David tilts back his head and pours the contents of the
carton into his mouth The slimy bundle of worms slides
slowly across his lips

Michael looks on with a sick expression He grabs
Davids arm

MICHAEL
Dont Stop

DAVID
Why
(beat)
Theyre only noodles

David shows Michael the carton again And sure enough
they are only noodles Michael is baffled The boys
have a good long laugh at his expense

STAR
Thats enough

The laughter dies down as a NEW SONG comes on the radio
Its apparently a favorite of the Lost Boys because the
MUSIC is immediately TURNED UP LOUD and all thoughts of
Michael seem to be forgotten

Everyone begins to move to the music Star encourages
Michael to dance with her Hes feeling the effects of
the joint he smoked and his balance is a little off His
head is spinning

During all this David has located a bottle of wine He
pours some into a paper cup and offers it to Michael
Michael is about to drink when Star holds his arm

STAR
(softly)
Dont Michael You dont have
to Its blood

Michael examines the contents of the cup and smiles know-
ingly Hes not falling for any more tricks

MICHAEL
Good joke blood

Michael brings the cup to his lips and drinks The Lost
Boys watch him carefully Wine drips from the corner of
his mouth But it looks more like blood than anything
else

Michael lowers the cup The room is spinning around him
Suddenly SLOW-MOTION DREAMY MUSIC

THE CAMERA TAKES OFF

whirling up into the air so that our VIEW of the lobby is
now from HIGH ABOVE

Michael summons his courage and climbs down David
follows him

ANGLE BENEATH THE TRESTLE 71

All five boys hanging on The fog billowing up beneath
them Michael starts to look down Then a RUMBLING is
heard in the distance Michael notices the look of
excitement in the eyes of the other boys

A PASSENGER TRAIN is approaching Its WHISTLE BLOWS
The trestle begins to shake A look of terror comes into

Michaels expression

DAVID
Hang on

The train THUNDERS across the trestle overhead only a
foot or two above them

The ROAR and the NOISE are tremendous The heat The
smoke The dust

The boys grimace and hold on for dear life Then
Michael reacts in horror as
PAUL

releases his grip and falls disappearing into the fog
below

Then Marko falls Followed by Dwayne Only David and
Michael remain David shouts over the DIN of the passing
train

DAVID
Let go Michael Let go

Michael cant believe what hes hearing Hes scared out
of his wits

DAVID
Do it

David lets go with one hand clings on with the other

DAVID
Do it Michael

David lets go He drops from sight vanishing into the
fog below

MICHAEL

Sweat streaming down his face The final car of the
train passes overhead and the noise begins to fade
Then Michael hears laughter from the fog below

LOST BOYS
Drop Michael Let go Its
safe Come on Dont be such a
baby

They WHISTLE and CAT CALL and do everything they can to
goad him on All the while invisible in the darkness

below

Michael lets go He drops into the fog

His eyes widen with fright -- but -- for a moment he is
buoyant -- suspended in mid-air -- floating
And then he drops With a WHOOSH Like dead weight

The wind RUSHING around his ears He loses consciousness

Completely weightless Gravity-free The white surface
is the ceiling

Michael heads into the house Lucy tugs on her own ear-
lobe to indicate Michaels earring

LUCY

Michael walks into the house without saying another word
Lucy looks frustrated and concerned

INT THE KITCHEN 130
Sam is at the table eating breakfast and reading a
vampire comic Grandpa is pouring a cup of coffee The
two brothers exchange a look but say nothing
GRANDPA
Looks like I wasnt the only one

Sam is reading

INSERT - VAMPIRE COMIC BOOK

A very bloody drawing of a vampire being staked through
the heart
MICHAEL

131 EXT IMPRESSIVE HOUSE SANTA CARLA - MORNING 131
Lucy and Sam pull up in the Land Rover

SAM
That it

Lucy checks the address she has written down

LUCY
Yeah Not bad huh

Lucy reaches for a wine bottle with a note attached as
she gets out of the Rover

LUCY
An apology for running out on
Max last night Actually you
should be making this apology

132 ANOTHER ANGLE 132
She tries the main gate but finds it locked
LUCY
I better leave this on the front
porch or someones just going to
take it

She climbs over a low portion of the fence

Lucy approaches the house She sees Thorn sleeping on

the porch
LUCY

Hi Thorn
Suddenly unexpectedly
THORN ATTACKS
Leaping to his feet -- charging from the porch -- GROWL -
ING viciously -- ribbons of saliva trailing from his
mouth
LUCY

turns and charges back toward the fence

SAM
jumps from the car

SAM
Mom

LUCY

drops the wine It smashes on the sidewalk She just
makes it safely over the fence as

THORN
CRASHES into it -- bending the bars to conform to the
contours of his head Thorn reels back stunned -- but

finds his footing and begins to BARK at Sam and Lucy
SAM
comes to his mothers side

SAM
You okay Mom

Lucy has skinned her knees landing on the sidewalk But
she is more shaken than hurt -- and she feels very
foolish

LUCY
Im okay Sam Im okay

133 EXT BOARDWALK - DAY (LATER) 133
Sam and the Frogs walk toward the beach with their comics

EDGAR
Weve been aware of some very
serious vampire activity in
this town for a long time

ALAN
Santa Carla has become a haven
for the undead

EDGAR
As a matter of fact were almost
certain that ghouls and werewolves
occupy high positions at City Hall

They sit on the boardwalk steps

SAM
I have something to tell you guys
(pause)
Not only is my own brother showing
systems of being a vampire but
now Im convinced my mothers
dating one
EDGAR
That is very probable Whats
your reasoning

SAM

Well he only shows up at the
store after dark And today
his dog attacked my mom

(whips a comic from

his back pocket)
Listen to this From Vampires
Everywhere

(he reads)
Vampires require a daytime
protector -- a Guardian -- to
watch over them as they sleep
For it is during the day that
the vampire is most vulnerable

Since they hold sway over animals
fierce dogs -- the hounds of Hell

-- are often employed for this
purpose

The Frogs are completely convinced

EDGAR
I told you that comic would save
your life

Suddenly Greg and the Surf Nazis appear and grab their

comics

the pieces over their heads onto the sand
Sam are enraged as the Surf Nazis walk off laughing to
themselves

EDGAR
I wish they were vampires so I
could nuke them in their hearts

SAM
How do you know theyre not

ALAN
They wouldnt be out in the
daytime

SAM
Exactly how many vampires have
you actually destroyed

EDGAR
All together

ALAN
Zero

In a flash they tear them to shreds and sprinkle

The Frogs and

Sam looks at them like theyve been putting him on

seen combat

zles her neck She turns her face to his Max is about
to kiss her when

Sam indicates Maxs large plate of spaghetti
SAM
How about a little Parmesan

Max takes the container and sprinkles some of the grated
cheese onto his spaghetti Sam and the Frogs exchange a
conspiratorial look

Max takes a mouthful of spaghetti and nearly spits it out

LUCY
Max Whats wrong

MAX
Its garlic I like garlic but
He sputters
SAM
Quick -- drink some water

Sam intentionally spills a glass of water onto Maxs lap

MAX
Hey Easy

He jumps from his seat tries to mop up the spill with
his napkin

SAM
Does it burn

MAX
Burn Are you kidding Its
freezing

LUCY
Max Im so sorry

Then very casually Edgar leans back in his chair and
flips off the lights The room goes dark

LUCY
Oh no Now what

SAM
Must be a circuit breaker

We hear SCUFFLING of FEET CHAIRS MOVING
into each other in the dark

EDGAR
(in a whisper)

(whispering)
Hit the lights again

And when the lights come back Sam is holding a mirror

to Maxs face

Startled at being confronted unexpectedly with his own
reflection Max YELLS Sam and the Frogs all look into

the mirror -- annoyed to see that Max is producing a
reflection
LUCY

Boys instead David has his back to him Michael comes
up behind him and spins David forcefully around

MICHAEL
Where is she

DAVID
Hey take it easy

MICHAEL
Wheres Star David

DAVID
If you ever want to see Star

David gets on his bike Michael is forced to follow
144 EXT WOODS - NIGHT 144
The motorbikes pull up and park Everyone climbs off and

begins to climb the high trees David waits to be last
He gestures for Michael to climb

MICHAEL
What is this David

DAVID
Youre one of us now -- arent
you
Michael hesitates
DAVID

Youll never see Star again if
youre not

Michael looks at David for a beat then begins to climb
the tree David follows him up

CAMERA RISES OVER THE TREE TOPS 145

to reveal Greg and the Surf Nazis camping in the
distance They have a fire going Theyre drinking beer
and smoking dope and laughing with their girlfriends

THE LOST BOYS
watch them from their vantage point high up in the tree

What happens next happens fast Its confusing and dis-
orienting Much is suggested but little is shown

ANOTHER ANGLE 146

The Lost Boys swoop out of the trees and attach the Surf
Nazis Mostly we just HEAR the NOISE and see shadows

THE SURF NAZIS

react in horror and confusion CAMERA FINDS Greg running
into the water David attacks viciously

DAVID
Hey dude My beach my wave

MICHAEL 147

stay behind in the tree He witnesses the attack but
doesnt join in From the expression on his face we
know that it is a horrible spectacle to behold

He turns his face away He looks like he wants to puke
Sweat beads up on his forehead and the color drains from
his face His breathing becomes heavy and his heart
begins to POUND POWERFULLY in his chest The vampire in
him takes over and as the Lost Boys shout his name he
feels compelled to join them but he resists with all his
strength

Dazed and frightened he tries to escape down the tree
All the while the SOUND of the VAMPIRE MASSACRE continues
in the distance He slides gasping and sweating onto the
forest floor

For a moment he just lies there looking bewildered
Then SILENCE The attack is over

Approaching FOOTSTEPS CRUSH leaves and SNAP twigs
Michael waits unable to move And

THE LOST BOYS

emerge from the shadows wearing eerie satiated expres-
sions their eyes glowing dimly They approach Michael

DAVID
No you know who we are Michael
and who you are too

Davids expression is calm and reassuring

DAVID
Youll never grow old and youll
never die
(pause)
But you must feed

Michael glances in horror toward the direction of the
Surf Nazi attack David Paul Dwayne and Marko walk
off

eyes belong to one of Grandpas mounted owls

MICHAEL

Sam swallows hard -- overwhelmed by the possibility of
such a responsibility

INT THE LOBBYCAVE - DAY 154

Edgar and Alan step into the lobby and look around with
wide-eyed wonderment A moment later Michael and Sam
come up behind them Sam is also amazed by what he sees

EDGAR
Theres got to be a sleeping
chamber around here someplace

As they search for the entrance to the sleep chamber
Michael goes to the spot where he knows Star will be in
the far corner of the lobby

Michael bends down to her She looks like a sleeping
angel He shakes her gently

MICHAEL
Star Youre coming with me

She opens her eyes -- is surprised to see him but hardly
has the strength to show it

STAR
Michael

He looks around sees a long hooded cape draped on the
bed

MICHAEL
Youve got to put this on

STAR
Take laddie

MICHAEL
Huh

STAR

Save Laddie first

Michael glances over to where Laddie is sleeping Stars
eyes beseech him Michael gives in to her wishes He
begins to wrap Laddie (who doesnt awaken) in a blanket

the air Sam coughs

EXT CAVE - DAY 158

Michael arrives at the Chevy with Laddie in his arms He
opens the back door and places Laddie on the seat lLaddie

the cave It is obvious that he is becoming extremely
exhausted and rapidly losing strength

INT CAVE TUNNEL 159

Edgar Alan and Sam are frozen in place with mouths
hanging open We dont know why until the CAMERA PANS

Everyone is relieved to have him back safely

Then

DWAYNE

EXPLODES from out of the fireplace Everyone SCREAMS
Dwayne flies across the room kicking Michael in the face
Michael goes down as Dwayne grabs Sam and lifts him into
the air

Star grabs Laddie and rushes him up the stairs to safety
Alan and Edgar swat baseball bats at Dwayne --

Dwayne mid-air above them still has Sam by the arm

But Sam uses his free hand to draw his water gun and

spray Dwayne in the face

Dwayne falls and CRASHES into the stereo turning it on
LOUD ROCK MUSIC begins to BLAST

INT SAMS BEDROOM 195
Star hides Laddie under the bed She notices that the
bedroom window is not closed She moves to close it when
it EXPLODES in her face and

PAUL

flies into the bedroom Star SCREAMS

INT LIVING ROOM 196
The boys hear Stars scream The Frogs rush up the
stairs Dwayne BELLOWS in protest -- and a beam of light
shoots out from his mouth Sam continues to squirt him

in the face The water burns his eyes blinding him

Enraged Dwayne becomes a disgusting and hideous sight
with flashing fangs and purple face

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 197
The Frogs and Star collide in the hallway

Edgar takes Michaels bedroom himself
INT MICHAELS BEDROOM 198
Edgar cautiously enters the room -- water gun drawn
The bathroom door opens behind him and Paul quietly steps
out He looks as horrible and nasty as Dwayne His
face evil and rotting His fingernails long and sharp
Paul bares his fangs They are yellow and bloodstained
He is about to sink them into Edgars neck when Edgar
senses his presence and spins around
EDGAR
(startled)
Ahh
Paul lunges but Edgar SQUIRTS him in the face with holy
water Paul YELLS and SCREAMS and flails his arms but
Edgar continues to SQUIRT and SQUIRT driving Paul back
into the bathroom

LIVING ROOM 199

Dwayne grabs Sam and is just about to gouge out his eyes
when

MICHAEL
Duck Sam

Michael recovered releases an arrow It WHOOSHES
through the air and sinks into Dwaynes throat

Dwayne ROARS in horror and pain So loud is his cry that
windows SHATTER and light bulbs POP

Then as if illuminated from within Dwaynes body begins
to glow It CRACKLES with electrical energy HISSES and
FIZZES Then vanishes from sight

INT BATHROOM 200

Edgar shooting holy water as Paul backs into bathroom

EDGAR
Alan Alan Im almost out of
ammo

Sam and Michaels bedrooms are connected by the bath-
room Alan hears Edgars cry and enters the bathroom from
Sams side coming up behind Paul

Alan sees the bathtub filled with holy water and has an
idea He gets down on his hands and knees behind Paul

Edgar catches on and head-butts Paul knocking him back-
wards Paul trips over Alan and falls into the tub with

a SPLASH

The water burns Paul SCREAM and kicks The water turns
to a frothy pink and yellow foam -- boiling up spitting
and shooting into the air like a geyser Alan and Edgar
jump back And in a moment Paul is gone

EXT ROOF 201
Shoots through the roof

LIVING ROOM 202
Michael and Sam are about to run upstairs when

MARKO

CRASHES up through the window in front of them blocking
their path Michael and Sam leap back

Then Michael looks up -- just as
DAVID

crashes through another window Hovering in the air
directly overhead his back pressed against the ceiling

Sam and Michael react as David SWOOPS down on them --
fangs exposed claws extended The boys leap away but
Davids claws rake across Michaels back tearing his
shirt and drawing blood

Marko SMASHES the living room lamps and the room goes
dark Marko and David -- glowing dimly -- soar around
the room like bats

Marko and David enjoy the superiority of the air but
Michael has had enough Sensing his own ability to
fly he leaps into the air and speeds toward David

Sam looks astonished and Marko catches him off-guard
He scoops him up and flies him into the kitchen

Michaels flying is not pretty He tumbles awkwardly
through the air But his aim is good He COLLIDES with
David in mid-air Michael ricochets across the room and
David is propelled in a new direction as well

The two of them careen from wall to wall like racquet
balls

INT MICHAELS BEDROOM 203

Edgar and Alan still flushed with their victory over
Paul sit on the bed re-loading their guns with holy
water

ALAN
Did you see that sucker burn

EDGAR
Man we totally annihilated his
night-stalkin ass

ALAN
Two down and two to go

EDGAR

EDGAR

The girl and the kid I dont
trust em I say we terminate em
while we can

ALAN
You know what Youre absolutely
right
LADDIE

still hiding under the bed is listening to every word
the Frogs utter

He begins to transform upon hearing the Frogs plan
His human eyes roll back into his head until his

vampire eyes -- glowing red slits -- take their place

Laddie opens his mouth and a beam of light shoots out
His fangs begin to descend POPPING his braces off

Edgars and Alans ankles dangle temptingly before him

RETURN TO SCENE
EDGAR
Death to all vampires

ALAN
Maximum body-count

EDGAR
We are awesome monster-bashers

ALAN
The meanest

EDGAR
The baddest

The Frogs are about to exchange another self-congratu-
latory high-five when the mattress begins to erupt
between them It bulges and heaves and

LADDIE

RIPS through it Bedcovers are shredded and mattress
stuffing and springs explode into the air lLaddie has
transformed into the ugliest meanest little vampire
imaginable

Alan and Edgar SCREAM at the top of their lungs and

leap away from the bed in terror Laddie virtually pulls
the mattress apart climbs away and advances on the Frogs
who cower in the corner like the scared children they
are

Star rushes in sees whats happening and steps between
Laddie and the Frogs

STAR
Laddie NO

The Frogs are amazed to see Star fearlessly put her arms
around Laddie like a comforting mother and calm him down
And Laddie returns to normal before our astonished eyes

204 INT THE KITCHEN 204

Marko advances toward Sam Nanook GROWLS Sam throws
anything he can get his hands on Plates toaster cups
silverware etc They bounce harmlessly off of Markos
head and chest

Marko continues to advance Sam grabs the kitchen fire
extinguisher and SPRAYS FOAM into Markos face But it
doesnt stop him Markos long serpents tongue slips
out of his mouth and cleans the foam from his face

Marko just keeps coming He opens his mouth revealing
a blinding beam of light and long jagged fangs He
rushes toward Sam who grabs a round wooden napkin ring

and JAMS it into Markos mouth

The ring props Markos mouth open and offers a convenient
opening through which Sam begins to stuff entire garlic
cloves Markos eyes blaze

INT THE LIVING ROOM 205
David and Michael continue their aerial dog-fight

Michael looks like hes getting the worst of it

David gets the edge on him He comes up under Michael
grabs him by the waist and continues to fly upward until
Michaels head BANGS against the ceiling knocking him
unconscious

Michael drops to the floor

INT THE KITCHEN 206
As Marko struggles to remove the napkin ring from his

mouth and Nanook bites his ankles -- Sam continues to
stuff garlic down Markos throat

Suddenly Marko starts to swell up like a balloon Get-
ting bigger and bigger until his face nearly disappears
into a puffy purple ball

SAM
Nanook Hes going to burst

Sam and Nanook turn away as MARKO EXPLODES OS and gooey
green slime is splattered over the kitchen

Sam barely has time to savor the thrill of victory before
something grabs him by the back of the neck and yanks him
into the air

Its David He flies out of the kitchen with Sam

INTO THE LIVING ROOM 207
UP THE STAIRS

DOWN THE HALLWAY

INTO MICHAELS BEDROOM 208

Where he hurls Sam across the room Star Laddie Edgar
and Alan are there as well

David points his index finger and a ribbon of flame
shoots out -- like a welders torch Everyone fearfully
steps back

David draws a wreath of flame around the windows and

the door sealing everyone inside But he exits
INT THE LIVING ROOM 209

Michael regains consciousness in time to see David
approaching him

DAVID
Just you and me now Michael
One on one Fight to the finish

Michael gets slowly to his feet never taking his eyes
off David

DAVID
Its over Michael Youre the
only one left Theyre all dead
Sam and Star too All dead

Michael doesnt believe him -- but he looks worried
Then David attacks He leaps at Michael and the
fight is on

Michael grabs a wooden hat rack and swings it like a

bat It connects with Davids head but David is
unphased Michael swings again and David catches the hat
rack yanks it from Michaels grasp and SNAPS it in two
as if it were a twig Michael charges

They tumble through the air fighting fiercely CRASHING
from one room to the next

THROUGH THE DINING ROOM 210
THROUGH THE KITCHEN 211
INTO THE BACK PORCH 212
INT UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 213

Where everyone is trapped Sam and Edgar have their
ears pressed to the floor listening to the fight below

INT BACK PORCH 214

Michael and David SLAM each other into walls Finally
David picks up Michaels chest and propels him back-
wards two feet off the ground back --

THROUGH THE KITCHEN 215
THROUGH THE DINING ROOM 216
INTO THE LIVING ROOM 217

Where David traps Michael against the wall the barbell
pressed against his neck
DAVID
Give up Michael Youre one of

Youre one of us

Michael doesnt listen He struggles but cant free
himself

DAVID
Dont make me kill you

218 INT UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 218

SAM
We have to help him

EDGAR
How We cant get out

STAR
(after a moment)
I can

Everyone looks at her Star turns toward the burning
door contemplates going through it

CLOSE ON STAR

We realize that for her to go through the door she must
allow a bit of the vampire in herself to surface A
subtle change comes over her and she opens the burning
door and walks through it without harm

Sam Edgar and Alan exchange a look then put their ears
to the floor again

219 INT THE LIVING ROOM 219
David presses hard against the barbells The weights
sink into the wall and the bar itself begins to crush

Michaels throat

STAR (0S)
Leave him alone

David turns to see Star standing behind him She holds
the pointed broken hat rack in her hands

David releases his grip on the barbells They fall to
the floor So does Michael -- holding his throat and

gasping for air

DAVID
You cant kill me Star

STAR

(trembling)
I will David

DAVID
No Star Put it down Put it
down

Stars resolve begins to crumble We realize that she
is incapable of killing David He begins to approach
her

MICHAEL
David

David spins in Michaels direction Somehow Michael has
summoned up a hidden reserve of strength He holds the
barbells in his hands

MICHAEL
Catch

He pushes the barbells through the air toward David who
catches them instinctively But their weight carries
him backwards -- directly into the pointed end of the
broken hat rack that Star holds

DAVID
Ahhhhhh

The hat rack enters his back pierces his heart and
exits through his chest

David SCREAMS and BELLOWS and pulls out the stake
Light pours from the hole in his body like a brilliant
searchlight

Then David flies up and HITS the ceiling -- still HOWLING
and YELLING and SPARKING like a Roman candle

Then -- like a balloon losing its air -- he begins to
deflate and ROCKET around the room on a wild spinning
flight

Star and Michael duck to avoid being hit

David is heading toward the ceiling

INT UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 220
Sam Edgar and Alan have their ears presses to the floor
when suddenly David EXPLODES through the floor only
inches away -- and keeps traveling upward EXPLODING
through the bedroom ceiling as well

EXT GRANDPAS HOUSE - NIGHT 221

David CRASHES through the roof of the house and disin-

tegrates high in the night sky -- like a shooting star
EXT UPSTAIRS BEDROOM 222

Sam and the Frogs looks at the hole in the floor then
look at the hole in the ceiling then see the wreath
of flames around the door and windows blow out and die

They rush for the door
INT THE LIVING ROOM 223

Sam Laddie and the Frogs come down the stairs to see
Michael holding Star in his arms

All is silent And slowly they realize that they have
triumphed

EDGAR
(to Michael)
You destroyed David His hold on
you has been released

Sam notices that Michael Star and Laddie dont look
pleased

SAM
Whats the matter

MICHAEL
I I dont feel any differently
(to Star)
Do you

Star shakes her head no They look at Laddie He also
shakes his head no

EDGAR
That means we still havent
destroyed their leader

EXT SANTA CARLA STREET - NIGHT 224
Grandpas pickup rumbles down the street
INT THE LIVING ROOM 225
Headlights sweep across the front window

SAM
Someones here

Everyone looks toward the door -- and Max and Lucy enter
They stop dead in their tracks

LUCY
Ohmygod
SAM

Mom

LUCY
What happened Is everybody

Michael and Sam dont know what to say or where to
begin Then we notice that Max wears and expression of
pure anguish

MAX
Where are my boys

Everyone looks confused
MAX

Wheres David Where are the
others

Sam Michael the Frogs Laddie and Star know what Max is
talking about and they react in horror But Lucy is
still in the dark

LUCY

MAX

Lucy One big happy family My
boys and yours

EDGAR
I knew it You are a vampire

LUCY
(softly)

SAM

MAX
Michael invited me in Never

It renders you powerless

SAM

(to Edgar)
Did you know that

EDGAR
Sure The invitation protects them

Sam glares at Edgar As if to say Thanks for nothing

LUCY
Will somebody please tell me what
this is all about

MAX
Its you I was after all along
Lucy To be our day time guardian
I knew if we could bring Sam and
Michael into the faimly thered
be no way you could say no

Max peels back his lips revealing his fangs
MAX
I still want you Lucy I havent
changed my mind about that
Max advances toward Lucy He is the meanest
foulest oldest vampire of them all And all
and depravity that dwells within his soulless
manifests itself in his ghastly appearence

Everyone SCREAMS

He moves toward Lucy Yellow eyes flashing

Lucy jumps

nastiest
the evil
being now

Fangs

descending below his jaw Skin rancid Breath foul

Michael steps between Max and his mother

MICHAEL
I didnt invite you in this time

LUCY
Michael

MICHAEL
Get out Mom Run

Max ROARS and everyone is knocked to the ground and held
there by the sound Everyone but Michael that is

He alone is left standing to face Max
OUTSIDE HOUSE
Grandpa arrives home
INSIDE HOUSE
Max scoffs at Michael
MAX
Come on boy Come and save

your mother

Michael and Max do battle Michael is brave

but fool-

ish He doesnt have a chance

Holding Michael by the ankle Max spins him over his
head Michael hits against the walls and the bannister
SNAPPING off the rails one by one

Then Max releases him and Michael sails across the room
and lands in a heap Exhausted and defeated

WINDOW - GRANDPA WATCHES 228
BACK TO SCENE 229

Max smiles to himself reaches down and pulls Lucy to
her feet Prepares to sink his fangs into her neck She
struggles to get away

MAX
Dont fight Its so much better
if you dont fight

He lowers his head to her neck Lucy looks over his
shoulder sees something through the front window With
all her strength she pushes away from Max and

GRANDPAS TRUCK 230

SMASHES into the front of the house in reverse The
truck stops but the fencing material in the trucks
bed does not

Several large fence posts CRASH through the picture
window slicing through Maxs body like knives through
butter

Max ROARS in protest and in pain The force of the
impaling propels him backwards into the fireplace where
his body becomes a VORTEX drawing into it all that
surrounds it

It sounds like the RUSHING OF THE WIND as furniture
drapes carpets etc are sucked into the space that was
once occupied by Maxs body

Lucy Sam Star Laddie and the Frogs hold on to one
another for dear life lest they get sucked in as well
Michael too weak to save himself goes by -- but Star
and the Frogs are able to grab hold of him

Nanook also finds himself being sucked in But Sam grabs
him by the tail and holds him back

Everything else that isnt nailed down (and some things
that are like floorboards) disappear into the swirling

vortex

EXT THE HOUSE 231

Grandpa from his truck looks up at the chimney and sees
the VAPORIZED CONTENTS of his house being spewed high
into the night air

INT THE LIVING ROOM 232

Maxs own head and limbs are consumed in the vacuum and
the vortex beings to subside Silence

LUCY
Everybody okay

Everyone is able to get to their feet now Sam sees
Maxs driving cap on the floor He picks it up and
tosses it into the now dying vortex

Michael and Star trade joyful expressions

MICHAEL
Its gone I feel it

STAR
So do I
They look at Laddie
LADDIE
Me too
Michael hugs Star
MICHAEL

Everyone accounted for

Grandpa enters from the front yard He surveys the
scene then stepping over the debris heads into

THE KITCHEN 233

and goes directly to the refrigerator He pays no
attention to the mess or the gooey green slime that coats
the walls He just opens the door and takes a diet

Root Beer from the second shelf

He POPS the top takes a long swallow and lowers the can

GRANDPA
(to himself)
The one thing about livin in
Santa Carla I never could stomach
(beat)
All the damn vampires

EXT THE LOBBYCAVE - NIGHT 234

The place is deserted CAMERA PROWLS Then one by
one KIDS begin to arrive At first we dont recognize
them But then we realize they are The Runaways who
Lucy gave food to Maria from the Video Store

A couple of Surf Naxis (and perhaps others) They
are here to take up where the Lost Boys left off

CAMERA PUSHES PAST THEM toward the old mural painted
on the lobby wall The mural depicts a typical day on
the boardwalk in the year 1900

CAMERA MOVES CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE MURAL

And HOLDS TIGHT on one painted figure in particular

A man in a straw hat Hes grinning broadly and hes
most definitely Max
