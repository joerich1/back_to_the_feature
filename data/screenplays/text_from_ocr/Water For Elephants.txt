being loaded with animals

EXT PARKING LOT - CIRCUS GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

AN ELDERLY MAN JACOB JANKOWSKI - 93 year old - stands
alone with a walker in the middle of the empty parking lot
His shirt is stained with sweat - as if it took great effort
for him to get there As he watches the Circus disappear
Jacob looks lost bewildered and fragile

CHARLIE 50s circus manager and RUSS a tattooed teen with
rings through his eyebrows approach him with a wheelchair

INT JANKOWSKI HOUSE - JACOBS BATHROOM - 1931 - MORNING

of JACOB JANKOWSKI - 23 years old handsome full of energy

It was a big day My final exams

INT JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

Jacob bounds down the stairs and into the kitchen
JACOBS MOTHER AND FATHER are finishing up breakfast The
Father tunes a Philco Radio while smoking a pipeThe

pours coffee wearing a cardigan sweater and pearls

Late for class Jacob grabs a piece of bread and bacon and
downs a coffee as his mother sweetly scolds him in POLISH
His father says something supportive in POLISH as well

thanks him in POLISH He kisses his mother and exits

EXT JANKOWSKI HOUSE - ITHACA NY - 1931 - MORNING

JACOB (VO)

After six years of dissections
castrations foalings and shoving
my arm up a cows ass more times
than I cared to remember I was
finally going to graduate Cornell
in Veterinary Science I was summa
cum laudehaha and the oldest
male virgin on campus

INT CORNELL UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL 1931 - ITHACA NY -

Jacob sits beside a beautiful Blonde who distracts him with

her legs She notices him staring crosses her legs and

smooths her skirt

VETERINARY SCIENCES FINAL EXAMS is written on the board of a

Lecture Hall The Proctor announces from his desk

THE PROCTOR

You may begin

Jacob the Blonde and fifty other students open their exam

booklets and begin under The PROCTORs supervision

JACOB (VO)

I had my whole life planned I knew

exactly where it was taking me

And then with the opening of a

door it all vanished

The Lecture Hall door opens and DEAN WILKINS enters The
Dean

walks to the Proctor and they confer privately Then

THE PROCTOR
Mr Jankowski May we have a word
Fifty pairs of eyes turn to look at Jacob who looks up

EXT LECTURE HALL - CONTINUOUS - DAY

with a sheet-covered body A CORONER stands between them

INT EDMUND HYDE LAW OFFICES - DAY
Jacob in a black suit Mr Hyde is seated opposite him

HYDE
I know this is difficult for you
but theres been no mistake The
house and all their assets
including your fathers practise
are now property of the bank in
default of the mortgage

JACOB
But Im telling you my father put
away every penny he ever earned
They owned that house outright Why
would he have a mortgage
HYDE
My guess is because he let people
pay him in beans and eggs or whatever
they had instead of money

JACOB
And so hes penalized for not
turning away people who couldnt
afford his help He was a doctor

HYDE

Yes I know he was a very good man
but in banking terms in the
reality of what makes this world
actually function he was an
irresponsible man Im sorry but
you oughta to know the truth This
Depression is going to last fora
long while

(MORE )

HYDE (CONTD)
And the only ones who will be
standing at the end of it are the
ones who fight to take what they
need to survive Everyone else is
going to disappear Dont make the
same mistakes as your father
Jacob is disturbed by this description of his father

EXT RESIDENTIAL STREET - OUTSIDE ITHACA NY - DAY
Jacob in his black suit walking homelooks up ahead to see
EXT JANKOWSKI HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

All the family possessions are on the lawn being scoured
over

by strangers fathers Philco radio mothers jewelryA

foreclosure sign hangs beside his fathers business sign
JACOB (VO)

Things happened so fast my head

was spinning And that mortgageI

just couldnt figure it out

A DELIVERY TRUCK pulls up at the curb It is met by A BANK
REPRESENTATIVE who receives a package and carries it to
Jacob meeting him halfway

BANK REPRESENTATIVE
This just came for you Jacob
Whatever it is Im going to have to
include in the banks report of
assets Sorry You OK

(JACOB NODS)

I also have documents to sign

The Bank Representative continues MOS as Jacob opens the
package

JACOB (VO)

I didnt believe the lawyer or the

bank My mother worked They had

savings We were never broke So

why would they need a mortgage

And then it hit me

Jacob opens the package revealing a BRAND NEW SIGN reading

E JANKOWSKI AND SON

DOCTORS OF VETERINARY MEDICINE

JACOB (VO)

They did it to pay for my Ivy

League education

For a moment Jacob cant move This thought stuns him With
his house being picked apart and the Bank Representative
speaking about papers Jacob cant take it any longer He
drops the sign and walks away The Bank Rep calls after him

BANK REPRESENTATIVE
Jacob Jacob they need these signed
by the end of the business day
longer

and

FLICKERING

Jacob walks away from the Bank Rep pulling off his tie and
tossing it He is crying - the reality finally hitting him

JACOB (VO)

I walked and I kept on walking
Its a strange feeling becoming an
orphan the same time youre
becoming a manTo have this
freedom to be anything you want at
the same time everything you were
is taken away So I just walked
Then all of a sudden I stopped

EXT A CLEARING NEAR A STREAM - OUTSKIRTS OF ITHACA - NIGHT
Jacob stands with his feet in a clear stream He is no
crying There are dense woods pitch black all around him

JACOB (VO)

Like Id been sleepwalking and I

woke up I had no idea where I was

Jacob can hear the buzz of insects the glow of fireflies

the cries of distant animals in the woods It unnerves him
Far off beyond the dense woods Jacob sees A MOVING

LIGHT - like a distant silent star moving past the trees
The Light is moving around the woods until it curves towards
Jacobs direction He hears a distant CLANK-CLANK
Curious Jacob puts his shoes on and walks back to a gravel
path that leads to TRAIN TRACKS just as

THE MASSIVE TRAIN ENGINE EXPLODES INTO VIEW PASSING HIM
Jacob is so close he is hit by a wall of wind that nearly
knocks him down It is dark and the train is moving fast

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)

What is it inside of us makes us
decide to grab onto life again and
again no matter how many times it
abandons us without a second
up

but

HUGE

blocked

lamp

as

thoughtWhat is it makes us

hungry for more of the same

Somebody smart should figure that

one out

Jacob makes his decision He runs parallel to the
trainstumbling over gravel pitching forward and losing
his balance recovering then running faster scanning for
something to grab hold of to hoist himself up He sees

AN OPEN STOCK CAR IS THREE CARS BEHIND HIMAs it catches

to him he lunges forward reaching for the iron grab hold
and flings himself upward He clings on with his left leg
elbow and chin His right hand clings to the grab hold With
his left hand he claws the floorboards of the stock car

the aged wood scraps off under his fingers His right leg is
dangling beneath the train itself dangerously close to the
tracks Jacob is slippingslipping

With everything hes got Jacob makes one final life or
death effort managing to get his left knee up over the
edge Using foot knee chin elbow and fingernails he
scrapes his way inside the stock car and lies panting

INT STOCK CAR - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

A dim light barely illuminates the interior Jacob breaths a
brief sigh of relief and accomplishment when suddenly A

HAND CONNECTED TO A EVEN LARGER ARM COMES OUT OF THE

DARKNESS GRABBING JACOB BY HIS COLLAR HOISTING HIM UP
Jacob swings at this Brute with his free arm but its

easily as the Brute moves him to the open car door

OLD TIMER (0OS)

Oh dont go messin with Blackie

Throwing people off of trains is

one of the perks of his job

Jacob can now see THREE MEN playing cards by a kerosene

ONE MAN HAS A RIFLE aimed at Jacob Another A SHRUNKEN
STUBBLE FACED OLD TIMER drinks out of a jug
Blackie holds Jacob out on the edge of the open stock car

trees slam against the train almost cutting Jacobs face

BLACKIE
We dont need no bums on this train

and keep running

Old Timer rises with a lantern and hobbles on one bad leg
inspects Jacob and his nice suit with the lantern

OLD TIMER
Now everybody calm down here Grady

inside of the train
Jacob struggles as Blackie pins one

OLD TIMER (CONTD)

EXT CIRCUS TRAINCIRCUS GROUNDS - DEPOSIT NY - DAWN

The Train has stopped adjacent to a huge grassy lot Beyond
it the scattered buildings of Deposit NY backlit by dawn

Jacob jumps out of the stock car in awe of what he sees
Hundreds of dirty unshaven men pouring out of the train
like ants on candy The wagons of the train are painted
scarlet red with gold trim and sunburst wheels Emblazoned

each wagon BENZINI BROTHERS MOST SPECTACULAR SHOW ON EARTH
Jacob wanders as the Circus is being created Canvas tents

standing over seams lacing pieces togetherEight man
sledge teams pound stakes into the ground at breakneck

speedTeams of men are raising enormous poles with their
combined weight chanting Pull it Shake it Break it

INT MENAGERIE TENT - CONTINUOUS - MORNING

Jacob enters A stillness takes the place of the chaos
outside The translucent tent is as tall as the sky It has
barely been set up - just the tent and

THE ANIMALS

Jacob is in awe Camels llamas zebras and horses stand
behind low ropes slung between iron stakes some with their
heads in mounds of hay Two giraffes stand within a

link fencelions tigers panthers jaguars bears

and an Orangutan
The animals stop moving as if to give Jacob an
and

acknowledgement Jacob responds with a nod or a smile
The Orangutan is stretching its arm outside its den for
something out of reach Jacob tries to understand

JACOB
What is it What do you want
The Orangutan strains its arm Blinking at him Pointing
Jacob looks around and sees A HALF SQUASHED ORANGE on the
ground in front of the cage He picks it up
Jacob opens the den and hands the Orangutan the orange She
takes it and sets it on the floor of her den She returns

reaches out for Jacob again

Jacob hesitates not knowing what she wants But deciding to
trust her Jacob extends his hand to hers

The Orangutan wraps her long fingers around Jacobs hand and
holds it for a beat looking to his face Jacob returns the
gaze realizing she is thanking him He is touched

JACOB (CONTD)
Youre welcome maam
The Orangutan lets go and returns to the orange in her den

hiding her routine boredom

Jacob is paralyzed by the sight of a naked woman

Grady frantically motions for Jacob to snap out of it and

the pipe at the heads sneaking under the tent to peek in

his job banging the heads thru the flaps

Jacob looks up to see

August is on the roof of the train his face moonlit his
hair blowing wildly in the windHe points downward
Jacob none too pleased advances to the edge of the

He can see the edge of a thin iron ladder He wipes his

on his thighs Focuses Then leaps

Jacobs right hand meets the ladder His left grasps wildly
until it ensnares the other side His feet jam into the
rungs Jacob climbs to the roof

across the moving trainJacob grows increasingly confident
and euphoric following Augusts exultant lead

The other side there is a makeshift door

INT RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - LIBERTY NY - MORNING

Jacob Marlena and August arrive at the stall to see Silver
Star is laying down He is breathing heavily his rib cage
rising and falling Jacob immediately senses the worst

AUGUST
Jesus Marlena he wasnt this bad
in the show
Jacob moves to examine the horse but he flinches in pain
Marlena takes over by sitting besides Silver Stars head
and stroking his head while singing a soft lullaby
Jacob registers Marlenas soothing effect causes Silver Star
to relaxhis breathing grows calmer So Jacob begins to
examine him as Marlena watches protectively
Jacob runs his right hand down the leg to the fetlock He
lays his hand on the hoof then place his thumb and

on the back of the fetlock He looks at the sole of the

which is bulging and dark with a red line around the edge
Jacobs expression tells us this is a bad sign

AUGUST (CONTD)
Is that the problem

(JACOB NODS)
Do you need any hoof testers
Diamond Joe has them

JACOB
Not yet

AUGUST
Well how are you going to fix it
Marlena looks at him coolly expecting an explanation Jacob
doesnt want to tell her the truth
Jacob looks to August and rises leaving Marlena with the

anything I could do I would but

Were all out of goats

EXT CAT CAR - MOMENTS LATER - LIBERTY NY - TWILIGHT

Go ahead They get a bucket each
Apprehensive Jacob hops up August hands him the buckets

INT CAT CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

The cat dens have two compartments to the left is a pair of
lions To the right a tiger and a panther All are massive
As soon as Jacob appears they lift their heads ominously
August has unlocked the dens but left the padlock hanging on

What do I do just open the door
and toss it in

AUGUST
Unless you think a formal sit-down
is appropriate
Jacob approaches the tiger first The six hundred pound cat
rises then roars his massive head hitting the cage and
rattling the lose padlock Jacob freezes

AUGUST (CONTD)
Why dont you start with Rex
thats him on the left
August is pointing to one of the lions - with a ratty mane
and visible rib cage Smaller than the tiger Jacob has a

more nerve He reaches for a bucketAugust suddenly
unnerving Jacob even more

AUGUST (CONTD)
WAIT

(JACOB JUMPS)
Not that one that one

He points to a difference bucket Jacob can see no

between them but no matter He lifts the bucket and
approaches the lions cage Rex the lion lunges at the den
door Jacob freezes

AUGUST (CONTD)
Whats the matter Didnt they
cover this in school
August is having a grand time Jacob smirks Rex is rubbing
his mangy coat against the cage bars
Jacob fumbles removing the padlock and laying it at his
feet He lifts the bucket and waits When Rex turns away

the cage door Jacob swings it open But before he can spill
out the contents of the bucket

Rex turns and chomps his huge jaw down on Jacobs arm JACOB
SCREAMS The bucket drops spilling the entrails inside
cause Rex to release Jacobs arm and attack the food

Jacob slams the cage shut and checks to see if he has an
arm

He does but it is dripping with saliva and as red as if hed

dipped it in boiling water But no skin is broken

August is hysterically laughing Furious Jacob storms off

JACOB
What the hell is wrong with you
You think thats funny

AUGUST

(LAUGHING)
Yes I do Aw Jacob wait Dont be
sore I was having a little fun

JACOB
FUN I could have lost my arm

AUGUST

(LAUGHS)
Rex hasnt got any teeth
Jacob feels more foolish and walks away when just as
quickly Augusts tone of voice turns darker

AUGUST (0S) (CONTD)

Jacob

Jacob stops and turns August isnt laughing any more He
has

that snipers stare of Augusts darker sideAugust moves

towards Jacob almost menacingly as he speaks

AUGUST (CONTD)
people want their money back when
the Star Act on the poster isnt in
the ring A Star Attraction keeps a
circus alive Without it animals
eat that and men eat nothing It
takes time to find and train
another horse so without Silver
Star I have no Star Act

JACOB
I dont know how hes been
performing August but you dont
have a Star Act now That horse
cant walk and if he does youll
lose him Hes in a lot of pain

AUGUST
Like this
August squeezes Jacobs sore arm from Rexs attack Jacob
cries out in pain as August holds his grip yet speaks
calmly

AUGUST (CONTD)
We always have choices Jacob - a
choice between our pain and someone
elses That horse was performing
before you came and he will
continue to perform until he drops
dead Im telling you to keep it
alive and thats what youll do or
youll be red lit like anyone else
who doesnt obey the law here
Every nation has its own laws
under God Jacob You left America
the second you jumped my train I
like you Believe me I do Im
only thinking of your future
August lets go of his arm and walks away Jacob is angry

INT RING STOCK CAR - CONTINUOUS - TWILIGHT

Angry Jacob inspects his arm - swollen and red from Rexs

mouth He hears OS murmuring coming from Silver Stars

stall He approaches to find Marlena sitting at Silver
Stars

head stroking his nose and humming the lullaby

Marlena strokes Silver Star as Jacob appears And Marlena

speaks to him for the first time

MARLENA
Tell me the truth Whats wrong
with him
Jacob hesitates before answering then

JACOB
The connective tissues between the
hoof and the coffin bone are
compromised and the coffin bone
rotates toward the sole of the
hoof If he keeps walking itll
puncture throughHes in a lot of
pain

MARLENA
And if he rests

JACOB
Youll lose him anyway Im sorry
Marlena breaths in this bad news and braces herself
welling up in her eyes

MARLENA
Then you have to put him down
Jacob is impressed by herand a little surprised

JACOB
Its the right thing to do

MARLENA
But August wont let you

JACOB
(Beat Then)
If Im the shows vet then its my
decision isnt it

MARLENA
But August wont like it

Then itll be my last decision

CAMEL
It cant be that bad
They laugh but Jacob insists boldly

JACOB
I need a gun Or a rifle Now
Grady leans inside the open car door and gets him a rifle
Jacob takes it and marches back They watch him curiously
Jacob passes Blackie on the way and boldly ignores his
intimidating stancePerformers and workmen sense a drama

rifle slides to his side He looks to Marlena This is their

The yaks are motionless Flies buzz around their head and
ears Jacob swats them awayThe Polar Bear is on his
stomach breathing heavily Jacob smooths his coatJacob
leans down and hoists a bucket of ice scattering the ice
near the polar bear who rolls closer to it

Jacob sees Rex lying on his side in his cage panting with
thirst He brings a bucket of water to Rexs cage and opens
it Rex gets to his feet but this time Jacob doesnt flinch
He isnt frightened He gives Rex the bucket of water Rex
drinks as Jacob strokes his mane which Rex allows

JACOB
Friends now
August calmly enters the menagerie with the rifle He walks
to the center and stops staring at Jacob
Jacob goes about caring for the animals - moving from one to
the next - trying not to be unnerved by Augusts presence
Then August does a surprising thing He sits in the center

the menagerie crossed legged with the rifle beside him

AUGUST
Youve got a gift for them Like
Marlena with horses Its God-
given I can always spot it
Jacob takes Bobo out of his den Bobo hugs him tightly He
continues on as he replies

JACOB
My father used to say that to me

AUGUST
He must have been a wise man

This stops Jacob Beat He turns to August

JACOB
How is Marlena
August tilts his head curiously with a smile

AUGUST
Youre a genuine curiosity Jacob
Jankowski What am I to do with
you I threaten to throw you
off a moving train feed you to my
lions and you go ahead and shoot my
star horse anyway So I think -
Jacobs an educated man For Jacob
to disobey me and shoot that horse
that horse must have been in pretty
bad shape Perhaps bad enough to
injure my Marlena during the show
And so I think Jacob Jankowski
might be a valuable person to have
around

JACOB
Tell Diamond Joe the animals need
more water when the humiditys this
bad if I dont see him before I go

AUGUST
Youre not going anywhere You
belong here These animalstheyve
been waiting for you

Jacob doesnt know whether to believe him or not

AUGUST (CONTD)
But dont ever disobey me like that
again Ill give you this one Ill
call it respect)Next one I call
betrayal Understood

(JACOB NODS)
I do thank you though You and
Silver Star solved a much bigger

Then
problem for me
August pulls a pack of Camels from his pocket

JACOB
What problem
August lights inhales blows smoke then

AUGUST
The cats You see meat eaters are
always more valuable to a circus
than hay burners And you saw what
we had to feed them

JACOB
What does Silver Star have to do
with the cats

AUGUST
We should have just enough food for
them to get us to the next show
thanks to you Of course Marlena
wont speak to me for a day or two
but shell come aroundSo I was
right You are a valuable man
As he walks away rifle over his arm Jacob is unnerved

with an additional room cordoned off by a velvet curtain
The main room is paneled in walnut and outfitted with damask
furniture a dinette and a Pullman kitchen

radiant in a rose silk off the shoulder evening dress

MARLENA

Unfortunately we had to let some

Jacob listens to how August will explain this

AUGUST (CONTD)

-I dont like doing it not one

bit But to keep hard working men

working I had to get rid of lay-

abouts and thieves who are dead

weight If I had the funds to pay

them all I would but times being

Jacob believes him August turns to him with cheer

AUGUST (CONTD)
So tomorrow my faithful bull man

Tonight we all deserve champagne
August whisks the velvet curtain aside

AUGUST (CONTD)
Ta-dah
A tuxedo for Jacob who smiles impressed

MONTAGE A PERIOD SONG COVERS THE IMAGES TAKING US OVER THE

COURSE OF THE EVENING ALONG WITH JACOBS NARRATION
- Three white-gloved waiters remove the domes off of silver
platters revealing oyster bisque prime rib boiled

asparagus in cream

- Marlenas dress barely covers her shoulders exposing her
porcelain skin and the curves of her breasts Jacob can
barely keep his eyes off of her during dinner

- Jacob is wiping his plate clean as August proudly offers
more Marlena laughs at Jacobs embarrassment when he
realizes his plate is clean

- Wine is poured over and overas the evening continues
- August is at the center of conversation entertaining
Marlena and Jacob They are drunk from the wine

AUGUST (CONTD)
Jacob I want to apologize to you
in front of my darling Marlena so
she can witness how truly sorry I
am for any bit of nastiness between
usRunning this show the many
pressuresIt can get the best of
me sometimes Im afraid

MARLENA

People dont realize how much
August does holding everything
together How difficult it is in
these times The whole company is
like a family to him

AUGUST
Thank you my love
He kisses her hand then turns to Jacob

fq

AUGUST (CONTD)

From now on I shall trust your

judgement in all things

veterinarian Please say you accept

my apology

Jacob is enamoured with August again especially seeing
Marlena smiling in agreement

JACOB
Of course I do August Youve been
nothing but swell to me

AUGUST
Good man

(SINCERE)
I could truly use a friend I can
trust

Jacob once again beams at the compliment as August pours
more

wine But Jacob feels a twinge of guilt He stands to make a

dramatic statement August and Marlena look up to him

JACOB
I have to tell you something You
may not trust me after you hear it
August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention

JACOB (CONTD)
I never took my final exams at
Cornell Im not a real vet
Beat Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the
dire
earnestness with which Jacob made his statement

JACOB (CONTD)
But its true I never got my
degree Im not a licensed vet
They laugh even harder

AUGUST
BAH A worthless piece of paper
from the ivy bush league Of course
youre a vet You have the gift
Youre idealism is just sosweet
When are you going to learn that
the rules written of by and for
these united states of suckers do
not apply to us

JACOB
Not about this August

AUGUST
All right let me ask you - do you
honestly think this is the most
spectacular show on earth

JACOB
(Beat Then laughs)

AUGUST

No Its nowhere near Lucinda our
Fat Lady isnt 800 pounds Four at

Tattooed Man got tattooed by

AUGUST (CONTD)
(Jacob and Marlena laugh)
The world is run on tricks - in
here and out there So trust me

dead God awful towns we play
Talent and illusion bringing life

Jacob believes hes right Marlena smiles in agreement
August rises to toast Jacob and Marlena follow

AUGUST (CONTD)
To talent and illusion

JACOB
To Rosie

MARLENA

And Silver Star
August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena

AUGUST
To all we love
He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in
front of a guest Jacob downs his wine closing his eyes
Suddenly August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up

dance throwing his arm around them both as we hear Louis
Armstrongs DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME

August starts singing along imitating Satchmos voice
encouraging Jacob to join inAugust is a great performer
filling up the space with his impersonation Jacob can only
laugh along
them

They

AUGUST (CONTD)
Come on Jacob Its customary to
sing for your supper
Jacob joins in to perform with August Marlena applauds

August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings

begin to slow dance very intimately
Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered
chair drinking more champagne Jacob watches them dance

JACOB (VO)

He looked like a different man when

he looked at her I said to myself

maybe love does that to a man I

didnt know much about it

Suddenly August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively

MARLENA
Darling Darling please

(GIGGLES )
Gently We have a guest
August stares at her His expression darkens - locking his

eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining
her Marlena smiles and strokes his face August doesnt
respond He remains intense

MARLENA (CONTD)
Darling what is it
August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete
control as if searching for proof of something he cant
trust His grip tightens hurting her
Alerted Jacob sits up prepared to interveneBut Marlena
shows no sign of fear She knows exactly what to do

MARLENA (CONTD)
August dear
She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it

MARLENA (CONTD)
You dont know your own strength
my love

And then just as quickly Augusts expression softens
relaxes almost into sadnessas if hes about to
cryMarlena senses it immediately She whispers lovingly

MARLENA (CONTD)
Auggie
August stops and eyes the bed beyond them He leaves Marlena
and throws himself face first on the bed

MARLENA (CONTD)
Excuse me Jacob
Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August lifting his legs
onto the bed taking off his shoes August begins snoring

Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the
curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room

JACOB
Is everything all right
Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there as she
returns to her Victrola and selects another record She
cranks it on and plays it low A RUTH ETTING SONG

MARLENA
Oh yes Hes just had too much to
drink thats all I hope you had a
good time tonight I wanted so much
to make things up to you

JACOB
Tonight was your idea

MARLENA

Oh Auggie wanted it too he felt
horrible about what happened He
really does like you Jacob But
its hard for him Hes under a lot
of pressure He does more than
people realize holding things
together

JACOB
You said that

MARLENA
Well its true
(Opens her arms to him)
One dance before you go
Jacob cautiously approaches Marlena takes his hands but

when

Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand
against

her bare back he almost swoons They slow dance Both
tipsy

MARLENA (CONTD)
Jankowski is Polish isnt it

JACOB

(NODS)

MARLENA

(LAUGHS)
Yes of course sorryI just

MARLENA (CONTD)

was really an Appaloosa fillyand
that I was just dreaming I was a
girl and one day Id wake upand

(LAUGHS)
Anyway I was a lot safer inside

Marlena stops not wanting to continue Jacob finds a new
route for her conversation

JACOB
What happened at 17

MARLENA
There was a parade for the circus
At the head there were six black
Fresians 17 hands high wearing red
tassles So proud So beautiful
And August was leading them The

looked at me I knew Id never live
with strangers again And the way
he talked Told me Id find a home

JACOB

MARLENA

August is sitting atop Rosie smiling waving his top hat

head in respect for Lucinda Manhattan is in the distance

JACOB (VO)

A parade like you never saw a

funeral and a celebration saying

goodbye to one star introducing a

new oneplaying those rubes dying

to get a peek like he was rolling a

coin over his finger tips

Rosie leads a small parade of clowns including Walter anda
perky healthy Queenie down the main street Marlena sits
atop a Percheron in full costume Jacob walks astride
Lucindas Wagon carrying the dead Lucinda follows

JACOB (VO) (CONTD)

It wasnt really Lucinda in there

It was Barbara in a fat suit and

wig inside the hippo den We buried

the real Lucinda by the railroad

tracks between towns Cemeteries

family she knew

People line up to cheer and offer their silent
respectsand

satisfy a ghoulish fascination at the dead fat lady

August sure was right about Rosie

She pulled the people right in

Rosie played that crowd like a pro

The rubes love the exotic Rosiekids run up to pet her

EXT BIG TOP - SPEC LINE UP - WEEHAWKEN NJ - DAY

WE HEAR The Band playing from inside the Big Top as the
performers and ring stock are lined up for the Grand Spec

JACOB
But as soon as the Spec started we
all knew it was too soon for
Rosies debut
Rosie heads the line Marlena sits atop her in her sequins
and headdress grabbing onto Rosies leather halter

August stands beside with the bull hook His face is cold

still His fingers clutch and release the bull hook

The SPEC MUSIC begins and everyone makes last minute
adjustmentsKinko and Queenie includedAugust shouts
into Rosies ear

AUGUST

MOVE MOVE
Rosie hesitates so August strikes her right shoulder with

bull hook The pain sends Rosie flying through the Big Top
flap causing Marlena to adeptly flatten her back atop Rosie
so as not to hit her head on the pole that runs across the
Big Top flap

Others gasp at the near accident August is already furious
Jacob senses danger ahead He follows in curling the edge

the sidewall so as not to impede the Spec performers
INT BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN NJ - CONTINUOUS - DAY
Jacob watches as Rosie makes it twenty feet down the

hippodrome track then stops
Without missing a beat Marlena yanks herself upright beams
performer

cheers

of

a smile and thrusts her hands in the air her back arched
her toes pointed - as if it were all a part of the act

The crowd goes wild - clapping throwing peanuts whistling
Rosie only moves in fits and starts causing the rest of the
Spec to pass them by at times She trots ahead of August and
then when August reaches her she stops making August halt
awkwardly August feels humiliated until

The crowd laughs thinking its the act They applaud
August realizes the crowd loves it So August the

starts to play the infuriated fool to the audience acting
comically angry and frustrated with Rosie

But when he turns back to Rosie he is red-faced with real
anger poking under her shoulders with the bull hook
After three stops and starts August plunges the bull hook
sharply into her shoulder bladeand Rosie takes off at a
faster speed curling her trunk in the air The crowd

Marlena grasps Rosies halter as they fast approach the
dangerous pole above the entrance If Marlena doesnt bail
shell be knocked off by the pole

Jacob August the Spec and the audience watch enthralled as
Rosie charges toward the entrancewhen suddenly

Marlena lets go of the halter and leans hard to the left
Just as Rosie bolts out of the Big Top Marlena grabs hold

the pole above the entrance and is left hanging there as
Rosie exits the Big Top

For a moment the audience doesnt know if this is part of
the act Jacob wants to run to help her

But Marlena quickly decides what to do She lets go of the
pole with her left hand and quickly swings around so she is
facing the audience still hanging from the pole

Her face lights up and she points to her toes The Band
Leader takes this as a signal and conducts the band into a
drum roll The crowd relaxes and applauds

Marlena begins swinging gaining momentum as the band roll
mounts Soon in one final burst of performance inspiration
she releases herself from the pole sails through the air
tucking her body into a ball rolling twice uncurling for
one sideways rotation and lands firmly in the sawdust in her
feet She straightens up and thrusts her arms in the air
The crowd goes wild The Band plays victory music Coins are
thrown from the bleachers Even the Spec performers cheer
August acknowledges the audiences response by bowing as if
it were all his creation

But after a moment Jacob can see Marlena is in pain as she
turns and subtly limps out of the Big Top He follows her

EXT BIG TOP - WEEHAWKEN NJ - DAY

Jacob rushes to her Marlena in pain collapses in his
arms

MARLENA

Oh Jacob
August rushes out and is stopped cold by the sight of
Marlena in Jacobs arms He immediately tenses up

keeps rhythm by banging her hands on the table

However she is acting distant to August

August is happy she is having a good time When he slides
next to her and puts his arm around her Marlena stiffens

INT MARLENAS DRESSING TENT - SALEM NJ - NIGHT
Rosie is staked into the grass inside Marlenas tent

occupied with a pile of watermelons

Marlena wears a silk beaded dress with the diamond necklace
There is a serving table with silver domed platters and wine
bottles Marlena is trying to open a champagne bottle when
Jacob enters

MARLENA

Oh hell be here any second

Jacob takes the champagne bottle and manipulates the cork
Rosies trunk is curious inspecting the bottle in Jacobs
hand Jacob laughs Marlena sees and laughs as well

laugh even harder when the cork pops

concern Jacob watches carefully Has it passed

mouth - Rosie reacts and Jacob moves to help her - as August
grabs Marlena shoving her so hard she falls against the
table knocking it and her to the ground He attacks her
trying to rip off her diamond necklace
faces

her leg chain

The FIGHT SPILLS OUT OF THE TENT INTO THE CIRCUS GROUNDS

into the crowd

in a choke hold Jacob is losing consciousness

Because of Marlenas screams - Earl and his men run to the
tent Within seconds they are pulling August off of Jacob
August gets to his feet His cool expression is even more
frightening as he re-enters Marlenas tent

JACOB

Jacob climbs down over the side ladder Beyond him we see

THE TRAIN IS TRAVERSING OVER A TRESTLE FORTY YARDS ABOVE

BOULDERS OF A RIVERBANK ILLUMINATED BY MOONLIGHT

Jacob jumps to the platform He can see the rocky waters far
below the trestle He catches his breath and waits as the
train straightens out onto land again

Marlena is looking up at him tears in her eyes She subtly
shakes her head NOShe doesnt want him to do this
Jacobs hands are shaking now The knife gripped in his

He wants to rescue her hes so close We hold the moment
Marlenas expression convinces Jacob not to do itnot to
cross that line and kill August

Marlena sees Jacob and makes a run for him but August
quickly grabs her arm and flings her to the ground She
out of view from Jacob
Jacob runs to them dodging the fleeing animals when
suddenly A BULL HOOK FLIES FROM OUT OF THE AIR ACROSS THE
ANIMALS AND PIERCES JACOBS SHOULDER He cries out
Rosie cries out She begins to stamp her feet Marlena lies

with her face in the dirt crawling beneath the ropes to get
under Rosie for safety

August pulls Jacob with a new bull hook tossing him the
ground August glares at him his eyes full of rage
head

AUGUST

YOU YOU DID THIS

He attacks but Jacob dodges the next blow grabbing onto the
bull hook and twisting it with such strength it topples
August who refuses to let it go

JACOB AND AUGUST FIGHT SAVAGELY AMIDST THE STAMPEDE Like
madmen fighting with the intention to kill

Jacob unleashes a rage and a strength we have yet to see in
him as he beats August without mercy

But August manages to overpower Jacob unleashing his own
maniacal fury By taking advantage of the bull hook wound
August gets Jacob into a death grip around his neck

Marlena screams out unable to help as animals stampede
around the two men locked in combat

Only Rosie who towers above them knows what to do

Jacob choking under Augusts grip looks up at Rosie She
raises her trunk to smile at him Jacob looks down and sees
that ROSIES STAKE HAS BEEN PULLED OUT OF THE GROUND

Jacob fights August to breathe as Rosie reveals she is
holding the stake loosely resting its end on the dirt The
chain still attached to her foot

Jacob flips himself which forces August to turn his back on
Rosie in order to keep his grip on Jacob

Marlena covers her head in her arms not wanting to see
Jacob can not breatheAugust is squeezing the life from him

AS
Rosie lifts the stake as if it weighs nothing and brings it
down onto August splitting his head in one clean move She
continues to hold the stake until August topples forward
dead his skull opened like a hardboiled egg
Released of August Jacob rolls himself under the ropes just

BEFORE

A HERD OF ZEBRAS RUN PAST CRUSHING AUGUST BENEATH THEM

Rosie then slides the stake back to the ground Marlena

hidden under her arms sees nothing The menagerie is clear
of the stampeding animals

Jacob He rises bloodied and beaten but alive

INT MENAGERIE TENT - PRESENT DAY - NIGHT
Old Jacob uses his walker to enter the menagerie He moves

each animal meeting his eyes with theirs Each animal gives
him a look of acknowledgment

He comes to an ORANGUTANyounger than the one from his
Benzini days Jacob stops He steadies himself

Jacob lets go of the walker and reaches his arm out to the
Orangutans cage

The Orangutan studies him for a moment Judging

Jacob keeps his arm extended which isnt easy for him
The Orangutan then extends his hand through the bars to
Jacobs hand

Jacobs fingers entwine around the Orangutans hand They
hold for a moment Jacob smiles

JACOB
