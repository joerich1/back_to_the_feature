A WHITEOUT BLIZZARD The snow FLURRIES The wind BLOWS It’s
beautiful but deadly

Slowly a FIGURE comes into view wearing an oversized men’s
RED PARKA with the hood up SNOW GOGGLES cover the top part
of her face a BLACK SCARF the bottom half This is EDITH
EDEE” HOLZER Her right hand grips a rope above her head the left holds
twigs for kindling The rope is tethered between two unseen
points She pulls herself forward working hard as her legs
stumble again and again in the knee deep snow

Finally an old LOG CABIN covered in white comes into view
The guiding rope above her connects to a beam over the front
door

She battles to the cabin’s threshold and sees ice has formed
right up to and under the door She tries to push the door
open It CREAKS but is stuck to the ice wedged shut She
drops the twigs

She takes a deep breath looks up at the icicles above her
after a bit of effort she snaps one off sucks on it badly
in need of water Any form of energy She is spent and
gaunt

She gathers her strength leans backwards as she YANKS the
door hard repeatedly It comes loose she tries to catch her
balance as skidding on the ice her feet give way under her
She twists to try and hold on to the door knob wrong
decision as her hands are not free CAREENING BACKWARDS
through the doorway -- losing her balance altogether and --

with one arm reaching down for their baby in the other

load up closer to the supply house They each disembark and
Edee stares silently at her new home for a long beat until
Colt finally states the obvious

Alawa is sitting in a chair at the table where she is
labelling a few bottles of liquid Edee is asleep on the
other side of the room she still has an IV in her arm
Miguel is unloading GROCERIES stacking cans on shelves
soundlessly careful not to wake her up

Edee twitches awake as if coming out of a disturbing dream

Alawa gets out of her chair takes two bottles with straws
as Edee tries to move her head We see Miguel sit in a chair
in the corner

Alawa crouches down lifts Edee’s head for her offers her a
straw Edee closes her mouth around it and drinks it

Alawa holds her gaze Then removes the straw for her

EDEE
(her voice cracking)
Thank you

Alawa nods “yes” puts the cap back on the bottle

EDEE (CONTD)
What is wrong with me

ALAWA
You have a bad fever from an
infection caused by the burn on
your hand You were dehydrated and
starving But you’re rehydrating
well now

EDEE
Are you a doctor

ALAWA
Nurse

Alawa guides the second bottle’s straw to Edee’s mouth

ALAWA (CONT’D)
We should take you to a hospital to
see a doctor

Edee tries to rise up on her elbows lets the straw fall from
her mouth

EDEE
No
LAND 42

ALAWA
We’re not out of the woods yet We
need to run tests make sure-

EDEE
No don’t move me please I
can’t I can’t leave here

Alawa looks at the stubborn sick woman with sternness anda
little curiosity Edee looks back unflinchingly Alawa looks
at MIGUEL then back at Edee

ALAWA
You could have organ failure

There is no reaction from Edee she closes her eyes again
lies back down This time it seems less out of fatigue more
out of wanting to block Alawa out But she seems to be
falling asleep again Just too weak

Alawa puts the bottles on the table
ALAWA (CONTD)
We should take her anyway She
can’t fight back
Miguel shakes his head - No

MIGUEL
We should honor her wishes

Alawa crosses her arms on her chest disapproving

ALAWA
I need to go back Can you-

MIGUEL
(already nodding “yes”)
Ill take care of her

ALAWA
You know what to do How to handle
the IV’S

Miguel nods
ALAWA (CONTD)
She’1ll need help every day for

at least a week

Alawa says it as if expecting a sigh of exasperation It
doesn’t come

LAND 43

ALAWA (CONTD)
I’1l check in with you everyday
And we need to take blood samples
if we can’t move her

Alawa takes her purse opens the door The storm has cleared
it’s gorgeous out Alawa turns back-

ALAWA (CONT’D)
You’re a good heart Miguel

Miguel picks up the chair soundlessly moves it outside with
him as Alawa leaves The SOUND wakes Edee momentarily she
fights to open her eyes one more time

EDEE POV

Sideways of Miguel’s legs as he sits in the chair as the
SOUND of the TRUCK PULLING OUT FADES

The SCREEN goes black an instant as we blink then we are
back on his legs

He stands up and walks towards us to crouch down but it is
Adam who puts his hand on our forehead

The IMAGE slowly becoming BLACK top of frame to bottom as
Edee closes her eyes

Miguel is hovered over the stove Edee twitches awake

There’s more color in her cheeks She actually is able to
lift up onto her elbows

MIGUEL
Are you hungry

Edee thinks for a minute then nods He nods back pouring a
bowl of the broth putting it down on the table then goes to
her to lift her She is very unsteady and has to lean her
body weight on him to get to the table He sits her down

Edee reaches for the bowl but her hands are shaky He takes
the spoon and feeds her a couple of mouth’s full It is hard
for her to digest

The silence fills the space but it’s not awkward or
uncomfortable It just exists

It is still hard for her to talk

LAND 44

EDEE
I think I’11 lie down now

He helps her as soon as he lowers her to the mattress she
lies down on her side

MIGUEL
Mind if I take the chair outside

EDEE
No

He takes the chair outside Faces it toward the mountains and
vista sits She watches him for a minute then closes her
eyes

thought of the SOUND being heard She finishes collects

herself and opens the door but Miguel is asleep in his
chair in the cold

INT CABIN - MORNING - WINTER YR 1 (D21) 156

Edee walks to Miguel at the stove on her own She is more
awake no longer super out of it but still weak

Miguel turns nods awkwardly-- Edee thinks for a minute--

EDEE (CONT’D)
What’s that

MIGUEL
Broth

EDEE
I smelled bacon

MIGUEL
That’s for me I’m not supposed to
give you anything like that for a

She walks on unsteady legs back to the table sits

EDEE

Miguel smiles--

MIGUEL
When Alawa says it’s okay I will
make it for you
(beat)
It’s good you have an appetite

Miguel sits down next to Edee with a bowl of broth They both
look very uncomfortable

MIGUEL (CONTD)
If you can sit up aa little

Edee slowly sits up She reaches for the bowl but her hands
are still shaky

MIGUEL (CONTD)
Ill help you

Another awkward silence MIGUEL brings a spoonful of soup to
Edee’s mouth She slowly opens it and swallows the liquid

Neither looks at the other until--

EDEE
How did you find me

MIGUEL
I was on a hunt I noticed on my
way by here there was chimney
smoke like any cabin would have
this time of year On the way back
there was no smoke

Edee nods She studies him

(motions to IV meds etc)
Why are you helping me

ALAWA
Id feel more comfortable if you

Edee does not react

ALAWA (CONTD)
Youve been very lucky You

Miguel If he hadn’t found you -

She caps the second vial
ALAWA (CONTD)
Miguel will bring you the results

as I assume you won’t be coming
into town to get them

She puts a band-aid over the needle puncture on her arm
ALAWA (CONT’D)
You should be okay on your own now
You have enough food Take it slow

Miguel pulls out a cell phone

MIGUEL
It’s charged If you need help

Edee shakes her head no and waves the phone away Alawa eyes
Edee suspiciously

ALAWA
Weve been polite enough not to ask
you all the questions one might
want to ask if they found someone
like you living somewhere like this
with no phone no vehicle no
nothing One might wonder how she
came to be in this place Might
wonder if people are looking for
her Might wonder if she’s hiding
from someone

The women gaze at each other

not running from anyone I’m not

All right Edee you’re right
about that but I feel I have to
say this (kindly) only a person
who has never been hungry would
think starving is a way to die

There are better ways to die

“There are better ways to die

Yes there are better and
there are worse ways to

- what in your estimation would
be the worst way to die

This is the first thing that she has said that stops him
completely He does not break her stare She crosses her arms
on her chest And in this moment he absolutely knows she
knows something about dying

It’s worse to be wounded and to
have to crawl off to suffer and
die

found her just upstream the

INT MIGUEL’S HOUSE - NIGHT - SPRING YR 3 (N54) 293

We find Miguel lying on a hospital bed Very thin now Very
pale His breathing is labored But he is conscious

Edee enters

MIGUEL CHUCKLES His eyes show he’s still there His laughter
soon subsides There is silence

The two old friends behold one another Finally--

MIGUEL
(in a raspy voice) )

damn mountain to see me
(smile)
I bet Alawa 100 that you would

LAND 88

MIGUEL (CONTD)

wouldnt

Miguel chuckles again Sickly and wheezy
Edee’s tearing up but smiles

EDEE
You didn’t have to be so dramatic
about it

She walks up to Miguel and takes a seat next to the bed She
can barely look at him

MIGUEL
Cancer Throat

Edee’s having trouble keeping it together She gently grasps
his hand Now frail and thin

MIGUEL (CONTD)
Didn’t catch it in time You have
to catch it in time

In the hallway outside of the room Kayla stands with two
GIRLS KAYA and ELKI EDEE
You could’ve told me The last
time You could’ve-

MIGUEL
Nothing from the outside world you
said I took you at your word

She nods “yes”

MIGUEL (CONTD)
The aliens did land by the way
(she smiles)
but I pay them no mind
(motions to himself the
room)
This is my world

ELKI in the hallway begins to cry softly For awhile all we
hear is his crying

Edee gets on her knees and puts her hand on Miguel’s head
She strokes it softly Beholding his face

MIGUEL (CONTD)
Glad you made it though so I
could thank you
LAND 89

EDEE
Me
MIGUEL
Yes You gave me all I wanted
Her face expresses “what”

MIGUEL (CONTD)
You offered me a way to die ina
state of grace

She looks at him in awe Of course he felt that way

EDEE
Miguel truth is I would’ve
died long ago if you hadn’t brought
me back to life For a long time I
wished you hadn’t I wanted death
and you took it from me But
then it became tolerable You
made it tolerable

Edee wipes her eyes with her sleeve He motions to the desk
in his room

MIGUEL
I’m giving you something

She goes to the desk There is a cell phone

MIGUEL (CONTD)

The phone is just for music Got
my music on it I think you should
have it

EDEE
Your music You got an iTunes
account so I can download Some
good music

MIGUEL
Ahhhh Sass at my death bed

He laughs She kneels back down next to him as he says
MIGUEL (CONTD)

Miguel takes a labored wheezy breath She takes her last
look a deep deep look into his eyes

His laugh calms to the most beatific smile

MIGUEL
