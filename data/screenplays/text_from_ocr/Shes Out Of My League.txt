INT CONFERENCE ROOM

A dozen or so shadowy people are seated in the darkened room
A slide projector dimly lights MR FULLER a crew-cutted
Robert Stack type in a suit as he addresses the group The
current slide is a still from a security video of a blurry
figure - it could be any of about a billion people

FULLER
-So lets keep a steely eye out
for this bastard (THEN) Before we
dismiss this is your monthly
reminder of why were here

Fuller advances to a slide of the American flag Close on
one of the group - a heavyset bald man in his mid-thirties
He politely pays close attention to the presentation

FULLER (CONTD)
The American people want to travel
(Slide Family in front of a fake
dinosaur) They want to attend
baseball contests (Slide Fat guys
spilling beers as they go for a
foul ball) and popular music
concerts (Slide John Tesh)

Close on another face in the group A doughy man with three-
day scruff and a trendily long haircut He looks bored
rolling his eyes at the speech

FULLER (CONTD)
They want to be happy (Slide People
line dancing) But Security comes
first (Slide Army soldier with a
massive machine gun guards a play-
ground) Without security there can be
no happy You are Americas front
line in the global war on terror
Lets hit the trenches and lets be
careful out there (Slide TSA logo)

The lights come up and as the group files out we get a better
look at their uniforms The TSA agents move out into the

INT AIRPORT - SECURITY CHECK POINT - DAY

The agents take their places manning the screening
equipment We push in on the bald man as he takes up his
post next to the walk-through metal detector This is KIRK
KETTNER He is not a looker His uniform only serves to
highlight his least attractive features but his eyes and
demeanor are pleasant and kind

The scruffy agent is STAINER He stands at the x-ray
monitor As the bags begin to move through he does not pay
any attention rather he hands Kirk a flyer

STAINER
Kirk bro Tonight

INSERT The flyer reads Wheel in the Sky - a Tribute to
Journey at Club Vertigo - Every Tuesday Night Stainer is
pictured wearing a massive afro in the band photo

KIRK
I dont know Stainer

STAINER
Dude you never come see us
anymore Its been like four
months Time to forget about
Marnie and get back on the whores

Stainer does a sex dance that makes everyone uncomfortable
Fuller shoots a stern look from his office

KIRK
Its not that Its my Grandma
Ill probably be at the hospital
for the next few nights

STAINER
Oh shit I spaced that Hows
she doing

KIRK
Shes hanging in there but it
doesnt look good

STAINER
Dude Im sorry Shes a great
lady That sucks

A Middle-Eastern man in a cowboy hat is next in line Mr
Fuller appears behind Kirk taps his shoulder and subtly
motions to the Arab Kirk smiles at the potential terrorist

KIRK
Hey there Habib

HABIB
(perfect English with a
southern accent)
Howdy Kirk Lemme guess I been
flagged for a random search
KIRK

Delaware

Kirk opens Habibs bag

HABIB (CONTD)

Kirk gestures to his boss as he zips the bag back up

KIRK (CONTD)
Okay Habib youre all set buddy

HABIB

Fuller again appears behind Kirk

HABIB (CONTD)
(to fuller - now ina
thick Arab accent)
Praise be to Allah

FULLER
You think thats funny You wanna
sit in first class or you wanna sit
on my gloved and jellied finger

EXT AIRPORT CURB - DAY

Follow a pair of perfect female legs as the womans heels
click along the sidewalk suitcase rolling behind Although
we cant see the woman riding on these legs we can see
several men stare as she passes by on her way into

INT AIRPORT TICKETING
More stares from more men and even a few women as we follow

the legs to the check-in line The legs glide to the front
and stop to wait for the next available ticket agent
From the slightly upward angle we see two young male ticket
agents (One on each side of the legs) One is black and one
white each are dealing with customers They simultaneously
notice our woman They suspiciously eye one another and the
race is on Each agent begins typing furiously to expedite
their current customer in the hope of waiting on her next

Angle on the WHITE AGENT as he waits on a yuppie couple

WHITE AGENT
(rushed)
Okay how many bags are you
checking Any bags

YUPPIE MAN
Is this one too big to carry on

WHITE AGENT
No Carry it on Good call

YUPPIE WOMAN
Grant you dont want to lug that
thing all over the airport

The agent leans back and issues a bothered sigh He looks to
his right to check the progress of the BLACK AGENT who is
waiting on an old Asian woman

BLACK AGENT
(rushed)
Did you pack your bags yourself

The Asian woman obviously did not understand a word of the
question but she smiles and nods along

ASIAN WOMAN
Yes

BLACK AGENT

Has anyone unknown to you asked you
to carry anything onto your flight

More smiles and blank nods

ASIAN WOMAN
Yes

BLACK AGENT
I think you mean NO

WHITE AGENT
You cant do that
BLACK AGENT
She doesnt know what the hell Im
talking about

YUPPIE MAN
Where exactly is gate F5

WHITE AGENT
Just past F4 Have a day now
folks Lets hustle it up

ASIAN WOMAN
Sank you

BLACK AGENT
No sweat Keep it moving

The Asian woman is not going anywhere The black agent leans
into her face and barks once like a dog Her smile turns to
fear as she backs away ending the race in a dead tie

BOTH AGENTS
Next

Reverse to show the woman they were competing for She is a
classy sophisticated blonde around thirty Drop dead
beautiful She is startled by the sudden call from both men
She laughs off her little scare and then randomly chooses the
black agent He shoots a smug victory grin over to his co-
worker who is being an overtly sore loser

MOLLY
Hi Im booked on flight 94 to
Burbank Molly McCall

BLACK AGENT
(trying way too hard)
California Fantastic So do you
travel quite a bit

The white agent moves to loiter around the black agents
station just to get a better look at MOLLY

WHITE AGENT
Hey Derek You got the numbers on
the (making it up as he goes) new
um procedures for the um airport
thing regarding the ah planes
(to Molly) Whassup

INT AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY

Kirk is at his post
Stainer works the next x-ray belt where a young rocker type
is running a guitar case through Stainer stops the belt and
moves it back to get a better look

STAINER
Les Paul Classic re-issue

ROCKER
(smug )
No its a sixty-five Mint

STAINER
Fuck you No way

The rocker boy looks at his watch as Stainer rolls the case
through and pops it open

ROCKER
Dude Im late for my flight

STAINER
Sorry I have to search this case
for you know explosives and such
This thing is sweet

Stainer takes the guitar out and starts riffing on it as the
bins and bags pile up before him

At Kirks station Molly (the blonde bombshell) is crossing
through Every guy who can see her has been struck dumb but
Kirk banters with her like he would anyone else No flirting
or stammering - just friendly and relaxed

KIRK
Morning

MOLLY
Oh hello again

KIRK
Second trip in two days

Molly is putting her laptop back in her bag

MOLLY
Uggh Yeah Its just a short hop
to LA but theyve got me going
back and forth three days in a row
This client is killing me

KIRK
Well hang in there kiddo and I
guess Ill see you tomorrow
MOLLY
Its a date

Mollys long legs carry her toward the gates as every man
except Kirk watches Fuller saunters up and nudges Kirk

FULLER
Didja see that Boy would I ever
like toyou knowput my penis
in her vagina (wink)

Back at Stainers station As he puts the guitar back in its
case he scratches it on the corner of the x-ray machine
Stainer and rocker boy lock in shocked gazes

ROCKER
What the hell

He grabs his guitar and inspects a wicked scratch

STAINER
Dude I am so sorry

ROCKER
Sorry my ass This thing is worth
more than you make in a year you
clumsy motherfucker

STAINER
Yeah I bet it was but

Stainer points to a white sign mounted in an acrylic stand
STAINER (CONTD)
TSA is not responsible for items
lost or damaged in the security
screening process

Stainer flips the sign around to reveal a few more words hand-
written on the back He reads them aloud

STAINER (CONTD)
so fuck you

INT HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Kirk enters to find his MOTHER an attractive old woman
sitting with a short plain woman about Kirks age

KIRK

INT HOSPITAL - GRAMMYS ROOM
In a dimly lit hospital room a very old woman lies in a bed

in and forces a smile Grammys voice is weak and shaky

GRAMMY
There you are Big Slick Did you

KIRK

Grammy you really shouldnt

GRAMMY

Kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes

GRAMMY (CONTD)
Oh for Christs sake Filters

Grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag Kirk tears
up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life

KIRK
I love you Grammy

GRAMMY

INT AIRPORT SECURITY CHECKPOINT - DAY

Molly is coming through Kirks lane again Mr Fuller steps
in and stops her before she crosses through

FULLER
Maam could you please remove your
jacket and shoes

MOLLY
Oh sure

She does Fuller is leering at her stellar body Shes
about to go through when he stops her again

FULLER
Why dont we go ahead and strip off
that belt too while were at it

Molly takes an exasperated breath as she removes her belt
She starts to move through but again Fuller stops her with a
raised palm He then motions to her breasts and crotch

FULLER (CONTD)
Any piercings youd like me to know
about

KIRK
Why dont you just come on through
maam and well see if anything
sets off the machine

Molly steps through The machine does not go off She
gathers her things and mouths a silent Thank You to Kirk
as she walks on Fuller glares at Kirk but before he can say
anything RANDY a young agent calls out from the office

RANDY
Kirk buddy Phone call

Kirk walks over to take the call
FULLER
You best hope the terrorists are
taking personal calls on the job

Kirk takes the phone from Randy

KIRK
This is Kirk Kettner

Kirks expression tells us that some sad news is coming in
INT AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Kirk sits at a table with a cup of coffee He opens his
wallet and flips to a photo of a much younger Grammy and an
eight-year-old Kirk in a casino Grammy is smoking a
cigarette and dealing blackjack while Kirk sits at the table
Kirk tears up and puts his face in his hands
Molly is passing She sees Kirk and stops
MOLLY
Oh Geeze Please tell me I didnt
get you in trouble back there
KIRK
No no Its not that I ahI

Molly sits down and puts her hand on his hand

MOLLY
Oh my God Im so sorry I

few months ago and I

Kirk tears up again and so does Molly

MOLLY (CONTD)
Your grandmother too And you were
close Oh you poor thing

Kirk tries to keep it together Molly looks at the photo

KIRK
She used to be a blackjack dealer
at the Horseshoe When I was
little she taught me and my
friends how to play poker Turned
us into a bunch of eight-year-old
degenerate gamblers

They share a sad laugh

KIRK (CONTD)
So your grandmother too huh

Molly removes a small clear-plastic booklet of photos from
her bag and shows a picture of her grandmother

MOLLY
My Grammy Keenan was ninety four
but independent right to the end
She was always trying to cook for
everyone You couldnt stop her

KIRK
Oh God I know Grammy used to
change her own oil Right up until
a few months ago She was Do
you change your own oil

MOLLY
(laughs)
No I wouldnt know where to begin

KIRK
I know me neither She could
barley walk and Id come over and

all covered in grease

They share a laugh and Kirk is cheering up a bit An
announcement comes over the PA

GATE AGENT

Molly stands and offers her hand to Kirk

Molly squeezes Kirks hand grabs her bags and trots off
toward her gate A businessman near Kirks table reaches
over and gives him a playful chuck on the shoulder

BUSINESSMAN

INT AIRPORT GATE
Molly arrives at the gate just in time to make her flight
INT AIRPORT COFFEE SHOP

Kirk gathers his things and notices that Molly left her
pictures on the table He looks through them In the last
pouch are some business cards that read Molly McCall -
Event Planner Her cell number is on the card

INT AIRPLANE 737

Molly is sitting in a window seat The flight is mostly
empty The two other seats in her row are unoccupied until a
CREEPY BUSINESSMAN moves from the row behind her to the seat
next to Molly He casually smiles as though there is nothing
odd about taking the center seat while the aisle seat (and
many full rows) are open Molly looks at the vacant seats
and then at him as if to say Youve got to be kidding

CREEPY BUSINESSMAN
How you doin

Mollys phone rings and she fumbles to answer it A FEMALE
PASSENGER sitting two rows back looks annoyed

cheering The puck smacks the glass before them and another
player skates up for it As he mucks it from the edge he
looks up and sees Molly Hes distracted just long enough to
get brutally checked face first into the glass A penalty is
called on the player who hit him That player skates into
the penalty box near Molly The name on his jersey reads

Stainer is immediately on his feet climbing the glass and
trying to pummel the huge player Security is on him ina
flash and dragging him kicking and swearing out of the arena

Reese wakes up and skates out of the box but its too late
The Sharks score and the crowd revolts A red-haired redneck
woman sitting two rows back calls out to Molly and company

INT BOWLING ALLEY - NIGHT

The SOUND of a bowling

The place is crowded and classic rock is cranking Its an
old alley with overhead-projection score sheets Kirk
Stainer and Devon sit and talk while Jack throws a strike

DEVON
Atta boy Jackers

STAINER

It doesnt add up Kirk If

KIRK

She was hoping to set Patty up with

STAINER
Oh great

KIRK

STAINER

So youre saying the hottest babe

STAINER (CONTD)
What did Molly have to say about
all this

KIRK
I dont know Stainer somebody got
thrown out of the game and I had to
drive him home remember

DEVON
Pretty impressive catch Kirky

STAINER
Theres no way Dont get him all
worked up Her friend was fuckin
with him Molly said herself that
Patty loves to mess with people

DEVON
Kirk you deserve a gal like her
And Stainer why dont you try to
be a little more supportive

STAINER
Why dont you try a little shut the
fuck up Devon This week were
not taking dating tips from the guy
who met his wife in eighth grade

JACK
Are we still bowling

Stainer picks up a crappy beat up ball from the ball return

STAINER
All Im saying is - shes just too
hot No judgement on Kirky the
guys just outgunned here

KIRK
I cant argue with him

Stainer goes to the line The BOWLER (a pro-type with a
custom ball and glove) on the next lane is already standing
about to roll Stainer starts to step up

BOWLER
Yo house ball I was up first
STAINER
Oh for fucks What is it with you
people
BOWLER

Just wait your turn

STAINER
All this noise and bullshit in this
place and Im such a distraction
over here in your god damned
peripheral vision

KIRK
Okay Stains take it easy

The bowler stands glaring back

STAINER
Well Fuckin roll then

The bowler takes another minute to set Stainer lets out a
long sigh The bowler steps to the line and Stainer rushes
into his own delivery Both men throw gutters The bowler
comes at Stainer but their friends separate them

BOWLER
Youre lucky motherfucker

STAINER
Oh yeah Bring it Brunswick

DEVON
Stainer Cool your jets buster

The bowlers friends drag him away Stainer takes a deep
breath before he shifts right back into conversation mode

STAINER
Okay Anyway I love Kirky but
lets face it the guys a three

DEVON
Stainer thats just dirty pool
Hes at least a four

STAINER
Youre outta your fuckin mind -
four You go ahead and pump
rainbows up his ass Im just
being honest

Stainer moves the score sheet and then writes a three on the
glass It projects onto the overhead scoreboard

KIRK
I can live with three
STAINER
Hes a nice guy and hes funny
Those are a half a point each

Stainer continues the equation on the projector

STAINER (CONTD)
But he drives a shit box so we
gotta deduct a point for that

DEVON
Kirk said she likes his Taurus

STAINER
Thats so fucked I wont even
dignify it with a response So
were back to three Meanwhile
this Molly is a hard ten

DEVON
A hard ten

STAINER
Generally if a broad is that hot
you can deduct a few points for dumb
or shallow but she went to law
school and her sisters blind
Thats a hard ten friends and that
is rare A seven point disparity -
thats a chasm The most you can
jump is two points I cant even
get a ten

JACK
Oh not even you huh

STAINER
Im a five okay

JACK
Bullshit Then what am I

STAINER
Youre a seven and a half

JACK
Fine youre a five then

STAINER
Okay so I get a two point bump for
being in a band That puts me at
seven On a good day most I can
bag is a niner

KIRK
What about your shitty car

STAINER

have a shitty car

JACK
Is there an artist exemption for
being a jag-off

STAINER
Fuckin A there is

KIRK
Stainers right Patty was
probably just messing around Its
not a big deal Lets just bowl

DEVON
What about Rick Ocasek Billy
Joel Donald Trump

STAINER
Yeah dumbass Those are the wild-
cards Money and fame

JACK
So if he were a millionaire

STAINER
A mil aint what it once was
Jackie Devons practically a
millionaire for Christ sake A mil
might get you an eight but to bring
down a ten now days - two million
minimum

Stainer finishes the equation by writing Kirk Fucked
Kirks phone rings He checks the ID and his eyes go wide

KIRK
(into the phone)
Hey Molly Um yeah sure
No that sounds good Yeah I know
where that is Um okay yeah
see you then

Kirk hangs up and gapes at his friends who wait in suspense
KIRK (CONTD)

Holy crap (dazed pause) She just
asked me out for tomorrow night

Kirk exchanges fives fists tips and hugs with Devon and
Jack Stainer shakes his head still not buying it

INT BOWLING ALLEY MENS ROOM

Kirk runs into the otherwise empty restroom He stares into

the mirror and his smile fades into panic He splashes water
on his face He reaches for a paper towel but the dispenser

Stainer is now next to Kirk who glares back at him as they
walk across the food court

A short plain girl behind the Orange Julius counter gives
them an apprehensive wave

STAINER (CONTD)

their path away from her Kirk waves

Kirk still in his TSA uniform walks past a large laundromat

to a small storefront next door The chipped and faded
lettering on the glass reads Maury Hammerstein Attorney At

Kirk reaches for the door he notices a small hand-written
sign I dont make change He goes inside

INT LAW OFFICE

Wood paneling buzzing fluorescent lights and furniture the
Salvation Army would sell only as firewood

Eric and Debbie sit with Kirks parents There are two
elderly women and another middle aged man in the room as
well Maury whos about a hundred years old - cute and
meek fusses with an ancient VCR while smoking a cigarette

Kirk sits down next to Eric Kirk notices a free bank
calender on Maurys desk - dated 1991

ERIC

The picture goes to snow and then stutters into a shot of
Grammy sitting in her kitchen She has just clicked the
video camera on with a remote control

MAURY (CONTD)
Oh good There she is

GRAMMY
Testing One two three four
Oh this God damned thing

She gets up and fusses with the camera

ringing is coming from the TV Grammy answers the phone

GRAMMY (CONTD)
Hello Im kind of busy right now
Eric Oh for Gods sake boy

She hangs up puts on her glasses and lights up a smoke

GRAMMY (CONTD)
Anyway I love all of you despite
some of the shit you pulled but I
spent my life a gambler and I always
put my money on the best bet The
odds of any of you fish doing
anything worthwhile with my stack

Everyone looks at Kirk who is stunned
GRAMMY (CONTD)
Im proud of you Kirk Dont let
your old Grammy down Do something

She blows a kiss lifts the remote and aims it at the camera

Oh for Christ sakes

She throws the remote at the lens The picture goes to snow

Maury digs into his desk and pulls out a mess of papers He
dons a pair of glasses that make his eyes look gigantic

MAURY
Lets see here Looks like she
had herself six Gs in savings
(MORE)

MAURY (CONTD)
Um another three grand in bonds
give or take Her life insurance
will pay pert-near seventy grand

He adds this up on an old adding machine (the kind with the
hand crank) and writes 77800 on a chalk board which is
mounted on the wall behind him

ERIC
She left him eighty grand

MAURY
Most of Stellas retirement home
expenses were covered by her reverse
mortgage But figure in thirty
thousand still due to Arborwood
Village She racked up forty-seven
thousand in medical bills And my
fee of course which now stands at
two thousand and change - which is
real reasonable folks

He writes Liabilities 79000 Total -1200

card Max then starts to wash up - so does Kirk

KIRK
Oh Hi

KIRK
My portfolio I dont really

Max takes the last paper towel - forcing Kirk to drip dry

MAX
Its okay if youd rather not say I

isnt that what a man of your means
requires in his financial planner

KIRK
My means

MAX
Judging by the company youre
keeping Id say that youre making
a handsome living I can help you
do even better

INT FRENCH RESTAURANT RESTROOM HALL

Kirk exits reading Maxs card - somewhat bewildered The
Maitre d stops Kirk and speaks in a French accent

quietly - now without the French accent

MAITRE D

EXT KIRKS APARTMENT

Its Friday night and several college parties are raging in
the complex Kirk leads Molly up the stairs and down the
balcony hall toward his door They pass a few college
students on the way a couple making out a guy vomiting in a
bush Two apartment windows are covered with tapestries of
Bob Marley and a giant pot leaf

INT KIRKS APARTMENT

Kirk and Molly enter The apartment is neat clean and
fairly sparse

KIRK
Its not much I know

MOLLY
No I like it

Molly walks around and examines certain items Kirk quietly
hides a framed picture of Marnie Molly passes his computer
desk where she coos at a screensaver of baby polar bears
Just as she passes it she bumps the mouse and the computer
comes to life revealing a Hot Back-Door Asians website
Molly didnt see it and Kirk scrambles to turn off the
monitor She turns to see what hes doing He smiles She
moves on to a rack of DVDs

MOLLY (CONTD)
Wow we have a lot of the same
DVDs Life of Brian Cool Hand
Luke Family Guy Beaches Kirk

KIRK
What Its a good movie

MOLLY
I love that movie

She spots a crate full of vinyl records

MOLLY (CONTD)
Wow records No Way Look at all

KIRK
You like Cheap Trick

MOLLY
Are you kidding Heaven Tonight is
the first album I ever owned A
hand-me-down from my big sister
She was the coolest person in the

She notices an upright piano in the corner

MOLLY (CONTD)
You play the piano

KIRK
A little My grandma taught me
It was kind of our thing She was
a great player Ragtime show

She plops down on the couch
MOLLY

KIRK
No I cant really play in front of
people

MOLLY

What the stage fright thing Come
on its just me Please

KIRK
No I really cant Trust me

Kirk decides to join her on the couch but then he balks into
a little dance of almost sitting He finally commits to sit

MOLLY
So youve never played in front of
anyone

KIRK
Nope Almost did once A talent
show in high school I just sat up
there drenched in sweat I really
thought I could do it but then I
made my big mistake

MOLLY
Let me guess You looked at the
audience

KIRK

Yep All these eyes on me Im
shaking my head is spinning Im
trying to remember if I even play
the piano and then I puked

MOLLY
Right there on the stage

KIRK
INTO the piano actually

MOLLY
Shut up Youre lying Why would
you do that

KIRK
It was a reflex I was trying not
to barf on the floor Turns out
its a lot easier to clean puke off
a stage than out of a baby grand

MOLLY
Yeah that has to be a real bitch
Oh I shouldnt be laughing You
poor thing

Molly brushes his hair back with her hand Kirk is frozen
with fear Molly leans in Kirk also leans in but not too
far Molly smiles realizing that its up to her to make
this official She takes him by the collar reels him in and
kisses him They make out for a moment Kirk is near panic
but he does his best to keep it together

KIRK
Sorry Ima little cotton-mouthed
Im going to get a glass of water
How bout for you Water A nice
glass of you knowwater

MOLLY
Yeah That sounds good

Kirk steps away from her and disappears into
INT KIRKS APARTMENT KITCHEN

He pours a glass of water Hes about to return when he sees
his reflection in the window The boner under his khakis is
not subtle He looks down and starts to panic

KIRK
Um You want anything to eat

MOLLY (0S)
No thanks

Kirk opens the fridge and thrusts his pelvis in He takes a
few deep calming breaths He closes the fridge - still at
full alert Kirk searches the kitchen his panic building
He grabs a Time Magazine He flips through frantically He
turns to a bikini model in an ad then a naked aboriginal
women then bare breasts in a breast cancer article

KIRK
Oh come on

He is sweating like crazy

MOLLY (0S)
Can I give you a hand

KIRK
No I got it

Kirk finally flips to a picture of Barbara Bush He stares
at it hard His boner begins to retreat

INT KIRKS APARTMENT

MOLLY
Listen Kirk I want you to know
that I would really like to you
know to be with you tonight

KIRK (0S)

INT KIRKS APARTMENT KITCHEN

The boner pops back up Kirk silently mouths MOTHERFUCKER
at his mischievous little man

Kirks reply is rushed with enthusiastic relief

KIRK
Sure Sure Yeah No problem
Great Thatsthats great
Ice You want some ice

MOLLY (0S)

Kirk opens the freezer He puts a few cubes in her water and
then grabs a fistful and shoves his hand in his pants

INT KIRKS APARTMENT
Molly gets cozy on the couch and looks even sexier

MOLLY
I mean dont get me wrong I want
to Believe me - getting naked and
crazy sounds fantastic right now

KIRK (0S)
Shit

MOLLY
Are you okay

KIRK (0S)
Yeah fine

INT KIRKS APARTMENT KITCHEN

Kirk runs the water while he digs under the sink He finds
duct tape He pulls some tape off the roll It makes a loud
noise that causes Molly to pause and Kirk to tense up Kirk
opens his pants and begins taping down the trouble-spot He
coughs hard to cover each subsequent tug of the tape roll

MOLLY (0S)
I just think we should get to know
each other first Im no prude

I mean Im pretty generous in bed
Once I trust a person I like to
experiment and get pretty wild

KIRK
Oh dear God

MOLLY (0S)
But I just need to feel safe
first

Kirk finishes taping up zips his pants and checks his
profile in the reflection from the window

INT KIRKS APARTMENT
Kirk returns with two glasses of water and no visible boner

KIRK
Hey Im totally fine with that

MOLLY
Youre the best

Kirk gives an aw-shucks head tilt Molly stands

MOLLY (CONTD)
Okay well Id better go then

They walk to the door Molly leans in and they kiss a few

moments more Kirk winces as the tape is getting a little

snug She drops her keys and then goes down on one knee to
retrieve them Suddenly she starts coughing She puts her
fist over her mouth

Kirks POV As her head and fist bob in front of his crotch
Kirk winces again She hears the tape start to give way
She looks up slightly confused Kirk looks around as though
hes looking for the source of the sound Molly stands
MOLLY (CONTD)
I had a really nice time Ill

call you tomorrow

KIRK
Great

Kirk opens the door for Molly

EXT KIRKS APARTMENT

As Molly exits she gives him one last kiss Two studly male
college students are playing foosball on their patio They
stop when one points out the hottie whos kissing Kirk

Molly trots off

COLLEGE STUDENT 1
Damn man That chick is fine

Kirk returns a cool whassup nod to the guys

COLLEGE STUDENT 2
All right Mr Kettner

COLLEGE STUDENT 1
You wanna play some foos

KIRK
No thanks fellas

Kirk beams from the attention as he goes back inside
INT KIRKS APARTMENT

He drifts over to his piano and sits down The joy of what
has just happened is plastered on his face He launches into
a furiously happy Jerry Lee Lewis style romp Soon a
neighbor is pounding on the wall Kirk stops playing

KIRK
Sorry Mrs Neusbaum

Kirk continues his celebration dancing around the apartment
He picks up the picture of Marnie and speaks to it

KIRK (CONTD)
Ron seems like a swell guy I love
Pizza Hut What Whos this
Why this is my girlfriend Molly
Oh dont be that way Oh there
there now Heres a tissue

He drops the picture and continues the dance
INT KIRKS APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kirk lies in bed staring at the ceiling fan The smile
continues as he drifts off to sleep Time lapses as Kirk
sleeps and the sun comes up Still smiling his eyes open
like a shot and he reaches for his phone - No Missed Calls

MONTAGE OVER MUSIC

1) Kirk gets up and goes into the bathroom He checks his
gut and hairline in the mirror

2) From under his bed he pulls out a Total Gym still in the
box It is dusty unopened and has a ribbon still attached
along with a card that reads Happy Graduation - Love Mom
and Dad He sits in the living room bewildered as he reads
the directions The parts are spread out all over the floor
He works out on the machine but it soon violently collapses
underneath him He checks his phone No Missed Calls

3) He throws away unhealthy snacks and treats from the
cupboards

He opens an untouched box of Healthy Bran and fills a bowl
He watches cartoons as he heaps sugar on the healthy cereal
and then checks his phone No Missed Calls

3) He surfs the web He reads info on the Hair Club For Men
site He moves to Hotor Notcom The first woman is very
pretty He rates her a seven the next is also pretty and
gets another seven the next girl is very unattractive Her
score is three Kirk feels bad for her and rates her a ten
He checks his phone He moves on to BackDoorAsianscom

4) Kirk watches a Connery James Bond movie on TV The lower
third reads AMCs 24 Hours of Bond No Missed Calls The
sun is setting and Bond is now Roger Moore - No Missed Calls
Kirk digs a box of Ding Dongs out of the trash and eats them
as he watches Its dark outside and Kirk is in bed watching
Timothy Dalton - No Missed Calls The morning light is
creeping in as Pierce Brosnan does the driving and Kirk is
still awake looking devastated - No Missed Calls

5) Kirk is at a convenience store buying milk He is a mess -
tired unshaven wearing a frumpy sweatsuit He passes the
magazine rack and something catches his eye Its a gorgeous
picture of Molly on the cover of Phoenix Entrepreneur
Magazine Kirk holds up the magazine and then catches his

own reflection in a mirror on a sunglasses rack

6) Kirk is walking home Every street sign billboard and T-
shirt he sees reads NO MISSED CALLS

the next room He jumps out grabs a small towel and starts
to dry off as he runs into the bedroom He reaches the
charger base but the phone is not there He stands and
listens hard to the ringing He runs into the living room
Angle on the phone Its hiding under a pillow on the couch
In the background Kirk rushes around the room flipping up
papers and magazines The phone keeps ringing and Kirks
panic increases until he finally spots the phone Kirk dives
for it losing his towel in the process

KIRK
Hello Hello

STAINER (VO)
Took you long enough What were

Kirk notices a woman on the landing outside behind him She
can see his ass through the window He covers up

KIRK
Sorry Mrs Nuesbaum

EXT DOWNTOWN SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY

Kirk and Stainer come out of a record store and walk past the
shops and restaurants Kirk holds a stack of flyers for
Stainers band As they walk Kirk hands flyers to Stainer
who posts them on walls and kiosks with a staple hammer

STAINER
Kirk its a simple rule of life
Look around People are pretty
evenly matched

Kirk and Stainer look at the couples that stand at the bus
stop sit in the outdoor cafes and walk down the sidewalk
Each couple is fairly closely matched - pretty with pretty
ugly with ugly heavy with heavy fit with fit

KIRK
Yeah but Stainer she was the one
who asked me out So why

STAINER
That first night were you
intimidated by her

KIRK
No I didnt think I had a chance

STAINER
Exactly So you were relaxed and
funny You were on

Stainer posts several Wheel in the Sky flyers on a kiosk

KIRK
So I gotta get back to that

STAINER
Thats just it Kirky Now that
shes opened the door you cant
get back to that

KIRK
So Ill have to fake it

STAINER
Forget it You cant fake that
far A broad like her - shell
smell that horseshit a mile away

Kirk and Stainer enter a
EXT CAFE FRONT PATIO
-and take a table on the crowded patio

STAINER
Can we get a couple of menus
(then to Kirk) You eating

KIRK
Maybe just a salad

STAINER
Dude one salad aint going make up
for thirty years of chili dogs

KIRK
I know But I got dinner with my
folks later

STAINER
Fun Be sure and stab your brother
in the eye with a fork for me

KIRK
Sorry Erics not coming tonight

Kirk motions toward a mismatched couple (nerdy guy with
knockout girl) who pass Kirk and Stainers table on their way
to the valet stand Stainer rolls his eyes

KIRK (CONTD)
You know what - this is ridiculous
Im just going to call her

STAINER
Fuck you are Put that thing away
You do not call her Dont you get
it Talon is back in town

KIRK
No she broke up with him

STAINER
So youre telling me you were
sitting there a sweating
quivering stutter-bucket and when
you came back from the can Mollys
hugging a guy whos so good looking
youd probably fuck him What do
you think shes doing this weekend

KIRK
So what am I supposed to do

STAINER
What can you do She hasnt called
- shes not going to

KIRK
Youre probably right

STAINER
Just count yourself lucky You got
to kiss a goddess and you got out
before she recalibrated your
hardware A chick like that can
raise the bar too high and then
once she dumps you nobody else
measures up

KIRK
No youre right You know what -
its good Its better Im
actually relieved You should have
seen this Talon guy Man All
Ive been thinking about is having
to be naked in front of her I
dont need that kind of pressure

The valet pulls a red Ferrari up to the mismatched couple and
the nerdy guy opens the door for her Stainer shakes his
head as if to say Was there even a doubt

Kirks phone is sitting on the table - it rings Kirk and
Stainer can see Mollys name on the caller ID

STAINER
Dont do it

The phone rings again Kirk glances down at the phone
Stainer keeps a stern eye on Kirk RING Close on Kirks
eyes turning weak RING Close on Stainers threatening
eyes RING Kirk gives up and looks away Stainers eyes
calm Kirk snatches the phone but Stainer grabs Kirks
wrist pinning it to the table RING

KIRK
Cut it out

STAINER
Let it go

RING Kirk reaches for the phone with his other hand but
Stainers free hand intercepts it and these arms flail around
like battling snakes Kirk presses the button to answer the
call and instead moves his head down to the phone

KIRK
Hello Oh no problem Yeah I
was super busy yesterday anyway

STAINER
Would you look at yourself

Stainer lets go and Kirk sits up and backs away

KIRK
Well I have dinner with my folks

subject you to them Okay If
you want to I can pick you up

Kirk gives a confident smile and an I told you shed call
nod Stainer crosses his arms and shakes his head

KIRK (CONTD)
Oh sure Well then let me call

Yeah Buh-bye

STAINER
Well I guess you just solved that
An hour with your family and shell
file for a restraining order

KIRK
No Erics not going to be there
Its going to be good You might
be wrong about Molly She might

Stainer spots a round little boy posting a Lost Puppy flyer
over one of the ten he just posted on the kiosk

STAINER
(to the boy)
Whoa I dont think so Spanky A
little lower
The boy instead posts it over a Walk For a Cure poster

him with a hand on his back This move isnt lost on Marnie

MOLLY
Your family I can deal with

And for me For what I said

MOLLY
Do you really think Im that

it or not I dont have gobs of
experience with beautiful women

MOLLY
Is that all I am to you

KIRK
No but I dont have much
experience with brilliant
successful wonderful women either

This melts Molly a bit

MOLLY
Kirk this cant work if you put me
up on some kind of pedestal

KIRK
Its not that I Okay look
When I was a kid we played a lot
of baseball in my neighborhood
The worst part was picking teams
because I was always picked last
Every time Like they couldnt
start a friggin game without first
establishing how much I sucked
So now you come along and make me
feel like the first pick But
what if I cant hit

Molly softens and smiles

Kirk nods

MOLLY
You already got to first base
Just keep your eye on the ball

and smiles back Molly steals a quick kiss
MOLLY (CONTD)
Let me tie up a couple things and

Ill show you around the grounds

Molly goes into a tent to speak to Patty Kirk watches her
with a calm relieved smile

VOICE (0S)
Boy she sure is something huh

Kirk turns toward the imposing Blue Angel pilot standing
behind him The pilot removes his shades - its Talon

TALON

Talon puts his arm around Kirk and walks him away from the
booth

TALON (CONTD)
Anyway listen Kirk is it fair to

TALON
Well I understand that fellas like

candid relationships with the women
they befriend Am I right

KIRK
Fellas like myself

TALON

problem with your lifestyle What
grown men do in the privacy of
their homes is none of my concern

KIRK
Talon Im not

TALON
Hey Im in the Navy I dont ask

Talon looks over his shoulder to confirm they are alone

TALON (CONTD)
Now I dont know what Mollys told
you about me but anything bad - I

one of Gods own angels and Ive
regretted it every minute since

KIRK
No She speaks very highly

Talon finishes the long hug He and the other Blue Angels
walk off in formation Stainer rejoins Kirk

KIRK
That was Talon

STAINER
Who The Blue Angel guy (cracking
up) Duuuuude

Molly joins them

MONTAGE OVER LOUD CATCHY TUNE

1) Kirk and Molly walk arm in arm through the air show crowd
Kirks POV as every guy that passes checks her out Close on
Kirks proud expression The Blue Angels take flight Close
on the planes as they weave in and out of an intricate
formation A wider shot reveals that their jet trails spell
out MOLLY inside a heart Reverse to pan across Molly
(worried about Kirks reaction) Kirk (trying not betray his
insecurity) and Stainer (trying to hold back his laughter)

2) Kirk and Molly in a crowded movie theatre She squeezes
his hand and he smiles back at her Molly turns back to the
screen and Kirks smile quickly degrades into a dirty look
The shot widens to reveal who Kirk is glaring at - another
man (also with a date) sits on Mollys opposite side and
stares down at her cleavage The man looks up to meet Kirks
gaze and smiles back He offers Kirk a fist-tap behind
Mollys head Annoyed Kirk doesnt tap back Molly is
oblivious to this exchange

3) As Molly walks down a city sidewalk at night Kirk has
stopped to tie his shoe When he trots after her to catch up
he is tackled by two cops

COP
Nice try pervert

Molly spins around horrified

COP (CONTD)

Its okay maam This fat tub of
shit was following you but we got
him

Molly angrily grabs Kirk by the arm and frees him from the
cops grasp

4) Kirk in his TSA uniform addresses a group of patients at
the Childrens Cancer Center He demonstrates a metal
detector wand Molly sits with the kids who look bored out
of their minds Suddenly the kids light up and Kirk feels
hes making an impression until he realizes that Talon has
come up behind him Talon is dressed in his flight suit and
carrying an arm-load of toy jets The kids excitedly jump up
and gather round Talon some even hug him

FADE MUSIC
INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Dressed up and wearing party hats Kirk Stainer Devon Jack
and about thirty others stand in a small classy restaurant

The place is decorated with balloons and streamers A huge
banner reads HAPPY BIRTHDAY KATIE

STAINER

Patty runs in

PATTY

Stainer brushes off the comment Molly waves Kirk over

MOLLY

KATIE

KIRK
Oh thank you Molly raves about

Katie reaches out to feel Kirks face Shes a bit perplexed
by the result Two blind teenaged boys approach

BLIND TEEN
Mrs McCall

KATIE

JERRY
Yes maam Happy Birthday

KATIE
Its so nice you came (to Molly)
These are two of my star pupils
Robert and Jerry Boys this is my

JERRY

They each feel Mollys face and then start elbowing one
another like a couple of horny construction workers

A cake is brought in as everyone sings an unrecognizable but
uncopyrighted birthday song Katie blows out her candles

MOLLY
Whats your wish Katie

KATIE
I wish Kirk would play the piano
for me

Kirks face drops Molly kisses her sister on the forehead
as she has obviously coached the response Immediately Patty
is behind Kirk pushing him Kirk tries to politely decline
but now Katie has him by the hand and is leading him to the
piano bench Everyone applauds and cheers for him to play

KIRK
Really I can barely play

KATIE
Come on Kirk For my birthday

Kirk is sweating He reaches for the keys but he is now
white as a ghost Molly watches in suspense rethinking
what shes done Kirks hands shake He moves them around
hunting for a place to begin The party-goers stare and the
room gets quiet Kirk puts his hand over his mouth as though
he might vomit

Molly presses play on a CD player behind the bar Suddenly
a Cheap Trick song kicks in over the restaurants sound
system Katie jumps up to dance with her friends

Kirk gets up from the piano and tries to laugh it off Talon
appears behind him and puts a hand on his shoulder

TALON

KIRK
Oh hey Talon Thanks

TALON
Im glad youre here I feel
terrible about our little
misunderstanding I dont know
what had me thinking you were a gay
fella Molly tells me you two have
been seeing each other

Patty passes between them and gives Talon a dirty look

TALON (CONTD)

you Poncho Youre the better man
Now Ill step aside and truly wish
you the best of luck I wouldnt
wish losing that girl on my worst
foe But make no mistake you blow
it and Ill be waiting in wings
Love and war right chief

Talon gives Kirk a respectful military salute Kirk holds
his forced confidence until Talon departs Once alone
Kirks poise deflates and he plops down into a chair

The party goes on and Katie opens a small present

KIRK

PATTY

black dress She looks perfect in every way Kirk crosses
the room and walks out to the

DEVON

of telling you that Molly is a man

STAINER
Hey if that chick has a dick Ill

decides to sit

slippers She looks perfect She crosses to the bed and
sits down next to Kirk They kiss but Molly stops

argument which Kirk and Stainer mostly ignore like

Kirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the
plane From two rows back Eric reaches over some other
passengers to tap Kirk on the shoulder

ERIC

Eric hangs up a high five and Kirk leaves it hanging Kirk
takes a seat on the aisle next to Marnie He gives Marnie a
forced smile She puts her head on his shoulder Pan over to
the window seat where Ron sits watching them wearing his new
travel pillow

Suddenly there is a commotion at the front of the plane

FLIGHT ATTENDANT

Stainer barges past the flight attendant holding up his TSA
badge

STAINER
Its okay folks TSA This guys

and about two rows down the aisle before Kirk overpowers him
and stops

Stainer What are you nuts

STAINER

KIRK
Stainer No Believe it or not

STAINER
Kirky In junior high I peed my
pants in class and Eric started
calling me Stainer remember

KIRK
Okay yeah

STAINER
Pretty soon everyone else started
calling me Stainer because they
knew it would make me cry Then
you told me to own that name to
call myself Stainer so nobody could
hurt me with it anymore

KIRK
Whats your point

STAINER
My point is um Oh shit I
was just in the crapper and I had
this thing all worked out Damn it

The pilot is now behind Stainer and towering over him

PILOT
Sir Im going to have to ask you
to exit the aircraft immediately

Stainer turns into his face

STAINER
Im going to have to ask you to
fuck off immediately before I feed
you your own fuckin teeth

The pilot backs up and goes for help

and without pausing Stainer zaps Eric with a stun gun Eric
sails back into his seat as Stainer continues

STAINER (CONTD)

KIRK
Stainer I appreciate that you

STAINER
Kirk Marnies a fuckin bitch

Fuller and two other security people enter the plane The
pilot briefs them on whats happening

STAINER
Kirk You said Marnie makes you feel
secure but security is bullshit
Look at our jobs Its all for show
For all we know theres a bomb on
this plane right now

The other passengers gasp and most of them look at Habib who
sits a few seats behind Kirk

HABIB

Fuller grabs Stainer by the collar
STAINER
You want to see what I think of

security

Stainer turns and punches Fuller in the face knocking him
backwards onto the other agents

Kirk just stares back Fuller and the agents grab Stainer
but he clutches a seat and stays put
