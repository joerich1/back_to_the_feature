CATES
Hey the bastards got my gun I

HADEN
Jack come on there is an
official department policy about
cop killings Cop killers
represent a special priority
because any man crazy enough to
kill a cop is a greater threat to
an unarmed civilian In other
words we cant seen like were in
the revenge business I know we
all know the truths a little
different

Cates almost smiles at Haden

CATES
Yeah

HADEN
Anthing botherin you besides
losin your gun

CATES
Yeah It bothers me when cops get
hurt while Im makin a play I
dont like it

HADEN
You might be more of a team player
and a little less of a hot dog on
this one Jack

CATES

well for me so far Besides I

HADEN
Okay Youre not a team player
You gotta do things your own way

ELAINE
What makes you think they were
lesbians or as you so quaintly
put it dykes

CATES
Come on they were a little old
for a slumber party

ELAINE
It might pay to reexamine a few of
your more primitive notions I

was in bed with a girlfriend
watching TV last week Jack and
one thing we know about me is I
happen not to be a lesbian

Now if this Indians girlfriend
got upset when you came looking
for him it could just be shes
still vulnerable to him

CATES
So what

ELAINE
When a guy hurts you then comes
back bleeding on his hands and
knees who knows he might just be
irrestible
