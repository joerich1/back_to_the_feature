EXT CEMETERY - DAY
Silence except for the whisper of the wind

A WHITE SCREEN resolves into a wide view of a 19th century
cemetery its dark contours softened by several inches of
fresh snow Big wet flakes float down from a leaden sky

Wealthy MOURNERS stand under black umbrellas at an open
grave as pallbearers slide a gleaming ebony coffin from a
horse-drawn hearse

A legend FADES ON
BOSTON 1886

CAMERA DESCENDS to find a solemn bespectacled child EDITH
CUSHING age 10 in a black coat and hat Her delicate
features are half-hidden behind a mourning veil

Frightened the child clings to the gloved hand of her tall
bearded father (CARTER CUSHING 48)

EDITH (VO)
The first time I saw a ghost I was ten
It was my Mothers-

The coffin passes before the childs pale face

EDITH (VO)
At that age I barely understood what had
happened She had died of Cholera-
(beat)
And on account of her disease Father
ordered that the casket remain closed

As the coffin is lowered unto the earth-

INT YOUNG EDITHS BEDROOM - NIGHT

A coffin-like grandfather clock is TICKING in an enormous
gas-lit bedroom Shadows seem to swallow up the girls
collection of dolls and books

Snowflakes drift past the tall windows little Edith lies in

bed staring at the wall Her EYEGLASSES are on the bedside
table

( )

EDITH (VO)
-So there was really no last glimpse
No goodbye

(pause)
That is until she came back

The clock stops ticking the gas lamps go dark and the
floorboards CREAK Theres a rustle of silk as-

- a translucent tracery of cobweb ectoplasm crosses the
room its desiccated feet not touching the ground

The bed curtains move and the bedsprings sink down Edith
freezes her eyes wide her head turned away She hears a
low asthmatic sigh

A shimmering hand caresses the childs hair Finger bones
are visible In the dark a glimpse of a tormented face

EDITH (VO)
---and I heard her voice A throatless
whisper low and grave and full of earth
Her words seared my memory as if with
fire

MOTHER’S GHOST
Edith beware of Crimson Peak

Crying out the child sits up and looks around Without her
glasses the world is a blur

A HAZY FIGURE is floating away Edith puts on her glasses

No one is there The gas lamps come back on the clock
resumes its ticking

EDITH (VO)

Then she was gone
(pause)

It would be years before I again heard a
voice like that - or saw a dead thing
come to life But see it I did and the
horror hidden in her whispered warning
would change my life forever

EXT BOSTON STREETS - DAY

A perfect spring day in Boston The gorgeous blue sky is
dotted with puffy white clouds

( )

and below it a city is growing
SUPERIMPOSURE

A new century has arrived and the teeming streets are alive
with motorcars bicycles and horse-drawn carriages

CAMERA FOLLOWS a veiled YOUNG WOMAN as she passes workmen
paving streets and erecting power poles Steam erupts from a
pile driver smoke roils from vats of hot tar

The young woman reaches the front door of a tea room Its
EDITH now a pale but striking 22 year-old She still wears
glasses

INT SOCIETY TEA ROOM - DAY

Sitting alone among the elegant PATRONS Edith leafs through
a thick handwritten MANUSCRIPT making last-minute
corrections

At the next table the dowager MRS WALKER and her chubby
daughter EUNICE are gossiping with a group of vivacious
women

MRS WALKER
We met him at the British Museum Last
fall He took one look at Eunice and said
she was as beautiful as anything by- by-

EUNICE
Burne-Something- a painter- I think-
(beat)
Oh mother he is so handsome

MRS WALKER
He never took his eyes off you did he

EUNICE
(barely able to get a word in)
Well-
MRS WALKER
(overlapping)
-Then we all went to tea It seems hes a
Baronet-

SOCIETY GIRL 1
Whats a Baronet

( )

Edith closes her book and looks at Society Girl 1

EDITH
A Baronet is a minor aristocrat An
opportunist A man who lives off land
that others work for him

SOCIETY GIRL 1
Is that so Edith

EDITH
That is so

SOCIETY GIRL 2

Well from what I hear this minor
aristocrat is perfectly charming and is a
great dancer

MRS WALKER
whos crossed the ocean with his
sister Im sure its because of Eunice
Hes been writing us every week

EUNICE
Mother hes here on business

SOCIETY GIRL 1
Im hearing wedding bells But that
wouldnt concern you would it Edith

EDITH
No it wouldnt

Edith takes off her glasses and gets up to leave Her dress
and scarf are a sombre black and navy blue silk

MRS WALKER
I think its a shame Edith I really do
A man will never notice you if your nose
is buried in books

SOCIETY GIRL 2
Wearing black and writing all day long -
our very own Jane Austen

EDITH
(walking away)
Thank you Sally But I would prefer Mary
Shelley And Eunice You dont look at
all like a Burne-Jones Not languid
enough
INT PUBLISHING HOUSE - DAY

An enormous LOBBY bustling with activity Carrying her
Manuscript Edith approaches a reception desk where a GUARD
directs her to an elevator CAMERA LINGERS on a STATUE of a

man pensive and reading surrounded by a pile of books
This is a likeness of MR OGILVIE

INT MR OGILVIES OFFICE - DAY

In the same exact position as the statue SAMUEL OGILVIE
grunts with displeasure as he leafs through Ediths work

Edith discreetly uses her glasses to see what page hes on

OGILVIE
Hrumpf-

Ogilvie pointedly turns his chair around and reads some
more

Finally he puts the manuscript down He nods slowly
replacing it in the pouch

OGILVIE (CONTD)
So Miss Cushing How is your father

Now Edith knows what he thinks of her manuscript

CUSHING (VO)
I take it he said no

CUT TO

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A beautiful dining room with damask wallpaper and art
nouveau sconces Edith sits across from her FATHER CARTER
CUSHING (almost 60 now) His beard is streaked with gray

EDITH
After skimming a single chapter Father

CUSHING
Ogilvies old-fashioned He probably
looks down on ghost stories

EDITH
Its not a ghost story

( )

CUSHING
But it has a ghost in it-
EDITH
Father Its a conduit-

(off her fathers look)
-a pretext to talk about spirituality
The ghost acts as a metaphor-

CUSHING
Ah A metaphor That may be too
sophisticated for me then-

EDITH
Ogilvie said it needed a love story Can
you believe that

CUSHING
Well does it

EDITH
What

CUSHING

Need a love story

EDITH
No- Why Why must a woman always write
about love Stories of girls in search of
the ideal husband - or the man who eludes
them Is there nothing else

Her father stares at her blankly

CUSHING
I agree

Obviously he does not
At that moment a WHISTLE from a passing train anda
trains lights move on the sheer curtains Obeying an old
habit Cushing checks his POCKET WATCH - and smiles
CUSHING (CONTD)
Ill have a word with Ogilvie- Monday at
the club

She pulls the manuscript from the envelope

EDITH
You will not

( )

CUSHING
Why Why wont you let me help you
EDITH
No-
(beat)
I have to do it myself With my words on
the page Since Im not beautiful - or
graceful - or charming
CUSHING
But you are
EDITH

The words have to do it All I have are
words and they will find their way
into print Youll see In the meantime
you just have to hear me complain

He smiles and pats his daughters cheek

CUSHING
With pleasure always
EXT RATLYARD - DAY

A high wide view of a RAILYARD with steam locomotives
chuffing from a roundhouse

CAMERA PANS to a five-storey brick OFFICE BUILDING

INT OUTER OFFICE - DAY

In the large busy outer office a scowling Edith is sitting
at someones desk fingers pecking on a newfangled Underwood
typewriter

JANE a gray-haired secretary is showing her how to use it
JANE

See The carriage return is almost
automatic Just push this lever here-

EDITH
Automatic Such a horrid word isnt it
Everything is automatic now But -

(looking at the page)
-it does look stronger than longhand

( )

JANE
Its a diabolical contraption but if
youre writing to publishers youll get
their attention And youll save time I
warrant

EDITH
Im not sure I want to save time at all
What would I do with it

THOMAS SHARPE 38 enters Hes a well-dressed handsome
Englishman and carries a WALKING STICK and a MAHOGANY BOX
Edith is too engrossed in her letter to notice him

SHARPE
(to Edith)
Good morning Miss

Wham - Edith bangs over the carriage return and looks up
Sharpe blushes and removes his hat

SHARPE (CONTD)
Sorry to interrupt but I have an
appointment with Mr Carter Everett
Cushing Esquire

EDITH
Goodness With the great man himself
SHARPE
Im afraid so
JANE

Im sorry but Im the-
Edith signals her to be quiet Shell handle this

EDITH
Youre not late are you He hates that

SHARPE
In fact Ima bit early

EDITH
Oh - Im afraid he hates that too

Sharpe leans a bit closer
SHARPE
Pardon me for asking but - is he really

as terrible as they say

Edith glances at Jane and smiles

( )

EDITH
A monster

SHARPE
I dont believe it Why would a pair of
charming ladies work for such a person

EDITH
He pays me nothing

JANE
(chuckles )
True enough-

SHARPE
Impossible Where is this fiend I shall
make it my business to protest to rebuke
him-

EDITH
Hes just behind you sir

Sharpe turns to find Carter Cushing approaching hand
extended

CUSHING
Sir Thomas Sharpe Welcome to Boston

He holds the young mans hand an extra moment-

He regards Sharpes long wavy hair his walking stick and
velvet-collared suit

CUSHING (CONTD)
(gestures toward Edith)
May I introduce Edith my daughter-

Sharpe is speechless

EDITH
Weve just met father
(to Sharpe)
It was a pleasure to make your
acquaintance Sir Thomas I hope the
great man treats you well

She smiles sweetly at Sharpe who looks abashed but pleased

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The conference room overlooks the railyard A dozen BANKERS
and INVESTORS sit at Cushings table Amongst them an
elderly attorney - WILLIAM FERGUSON

Sharpes mahogany box rests near a stack of topographical
maps and production charts Alongside a small alcohol lamp
heats a miniature nickel-plated boiler

SHARPE
In the last few years we scraped
together just enough capital to reopen
the mines and find what we believe are
very encouraging samples

He shows the men a rough hunk of iron ore As they pass it
from hand to hand

CUSHING
We you say Who might that be

SHARPE
Mining engineers Geologists I have
their statements here-

CUSHING
So- youve never done any digging
yourself

(beat)

In that mountain of yours

SHARPE
Im afraid not

Cushing looks at the others Thought so

CUSHING
Go on

SHARPE
As investors in mining youll want more
than speculation and projections So
here gentlemen-

He opens the box to reveal a SCALE MODEL of a mining drill

SHARPE (CONTD)
-a steam drill - my own design - that
matches the output of a ten-man crew
With mechanized digging abandoned mines
can be reworked and made profitable
again

( )

He connects the little boiler With a HISS of steam the
brass levers and gears start moving the drill spins

The men admire its ingenuity - all except Cushing

CUSHING
Turn that off please

Sudden silence as Sharpe complies

CUSHING (CONTD)
So you come to us having failed to raise
capital in London

The Boston businessmen glance at Cushing whose cold smile
reflects open skepticism

SHARPE
London Edinburgh Leipzig -

CUSHING
Where your family name seems to have
counted for very little

The door to the conference room is ajar Edith stands there
half-hidden peeking in like a child

SHARPE
Im not discussing my name This is a new
century As a railroad man youll need
steel-

CUSHING
We have no shortage of iron ore in this
country Your holdings came to you
through inheritance did they not

SHARPE
All right yes My great grandfather was
Lord Middleton Sharpe first Baronet of
Allerdale But the Sharpe Mines are more
than a name sir More than nostalgia
They are my birthright

CUSHING
And now Thomas Sharpe the Baronet -
youve come to America where you hope to
raise money to honor that birthright

SHARPE
In part yes

( )

CUSHING
In this country we dont have such
traditions The men at this table - all
of us - we came up through honest hard
work Well- almost all of us - Mr
Ferguson here is an attorney but he
cant help that-

Laughter amongst the men

CUSHING (CONTD)
But- his father shined and repaired
shoes As for me I started out laying
those very tracks - there in the yards
below - decades ago You see And my
hands-—

He raises two thick calloused hands

CUSHING (CONTD)
-reflect who I am Just as yours do
Softest handshake Ive felt in years
(beat)
We bank on effort not privilege

Sharpe surveys at the faces of the other men now stern and
uncomfortable

SHARPE
(touching the model drill)
I believe that inventions like this are
equal to any mans hard work I make no
apology for my dreams

A TRAIN puffs by in the railyard Cushing checks his pocket
watch

CUSHING
(without looking up)
Take your toy young man and dream
somewhere else

SHARPE
Mr Cushing I have tried to be as frank
as possible but youve not given me a
fair hearing

CUSHING
No Well you may attribute it toa
Yanks lack of breeding

Sharpe is devastated but silent

( )

EDITH (VO)
I knew just how he felt this fellow
dreamer when I saw him facing defeat

Sharpe turns and meets Ediths eyes She darts out of sight

CUT TO

INT EDITHS ROOM - NIGHT
Edith sits at her desk writing in her diary

Behind her a framed CHILDS DRAWING of a ruddy mountain
thrusting up into a blue-black sky The schoolgirl lettering
beneath it reads C-R-I-M-S-O-N P-E-A-K

The room is a bohemian hodgepodge of books paintings rugs
and tapestries

EDITH (VO)
Over the next few days Sir Thomas Sharpe
walked the muddy torn-up streets of
Boston in search of an investor I
meanwhile had found inspiration

CUT TO

EXT MAIN STREET BOSTON —- DAY

Edith stealthily follows Thomas Sharpe through a series of
rejections

AT THE BANK she observes through an open door
AT A GENTLEMANS CLUB she peers through a window
AT A MEETING HALL he is again sent away
EDITH (VO)
I would rethink my book I would try my
hand at romance after all For the first

time the genre appealed to me

Sharpe finally reaches a deserted alley Exhausted and
furious he throws down his papers and the mahogany box

Once hes gone Edith steps out from hiding and looks at the
smashed MINIATURE and the multitude of gears spilled on the
ground

INT CUSHING MANSION PARLOR —- DUSK

At the mirror in his front hall Carter Cushing checks his
white tie and tails As a SERVANT brings him his hat and
coat Edith enters wearing a simple house dress

CUSHING
I do wish youd change your mind and come
along Its not just another party Not
that theres anything wrong with a simple
party mind you

EDITH
You know I cant bear such things

CUSHING
Theres a performance of some kind a
womans playing Chopin Or is it Ravel
I cant keep em straight

(pause)
And little Lord Fauntleroy will be there

EDITH
You mean Thomas Sharpe

CUSHING
None other I saw you spying on us
child

EDITH

I found him interesting its true Like
a character in a play

CUSHING
A bad actor you mean Nothing to swoon
about

EDITH

Nobodys swooning But tell me were his
ideas so outrageous as to merit such a
quick dismissal

CUSHING
It wasnt his ideas my love I felt a
lack of focus Is he the inventor of a
steam drill Or a mine owner seeking to
exploit his holdings Theres something
ill-defined about him you cant do
business with men like that

The DOORBELL rings

( )

CUSHING (CONT’D)
Thatll be young Dr McMichael Hes
brought his new motorcar Thats a good
fellow- Hes-

EDITH
(rolls her eyes)
I know Father- hes got such a firm
handshake

The servant opens the door and shows in DR ALAN McMICHAEL
31 a serious bearded internist He too is in formal

wear

Cushing dons

DR MCMICHAEL
Good evening Mr Cushing Hello
Edith

EDITH
Good evening Alan My dont we look
smart

DR MCMICHAEL
(blushing)
Not really No more than your average
penguin

CUSHING
Its Edith who should be the belle of the
ball dont you agree Doctor

DR MCMICHAEL
(gazing at her)
Change your mind Edith With you I
could actually dance

EDITH
You lads will have much more fun without
me
(to Dr McMichael)
Dont let him drink too much
(to her father)
And no pontificating brawling or
flirting either No matter how fetching
the ladies

his hat and coat

CUSHING
Ill be a saint

The old man chortles - Ediths the love of his life

DISSOLVE TO

INT EDITHS ROOM - LATER

Edith sprawls on her bed engrossed in a thick book replete
with maps of England

EDITH (VO)
I was busy reading about iron mining in
the North of England

Outside RAINDROPS spatter the windows Sharpes half-
assembled MINIATURE DRILL stands on the desk

Edith turns a page and stumbles upon an old engraving of a
mining operation in Cumberland

EDITH (VO)
And I found the Sharpe mines in a barren
landscape at the base of a mountain

Outside a distant RUMBLE of thunder And behind her - the
miniature steam drill tumbles off the desk and crashes to
the floor

Edith leaps to her feet The mirrored door to an ARMOIRE
opens and something recedes into a darkness Only the hem of
a dress is visible Edith recognizes it

EDITH
(whisper)
Mother-

She approaches the corner and descries the rippling shape of
a WOMAN - shadow upon shadow

A cadaverous FACE seems to emerge from the darkness with
enormous eyes wet with tears

As Edith suppresses a scream - a TAP on the door and a MAID
SERVANT leans in

MAID
Excuse me miss —

Edith spins around then glances back seeing nothing now-
just a dark dress hanging in the armoir

( )

MAID (CONTD)
Are you all right miss Whatever is the

matter

EDITH
Nothing You - you startled me thats
all

MAID

Theres a Thomas Sharpe at the door hes
dripping wet and most insistent on coming
in

EDITH
Thomas Sharpe At this hour Its out of
the question Annie

MAID
I told him miss He wont go away

Edith dons a dressing gown and goes to the window
overlooking the rainy courtyard Thomas Sharpe stands at the
front door holding an umbrella Hes wearing white tie and
tails

She removes her glasses and opens the window

EDITH
Good evening Mr Sharpe Fathers not
home Im sorry to say

SHARPE
Of course hes not Hes gone - maybe by
gondola - to the reception at the Walker
house Which is my destination too

EDITH
But thats in Roxbury This is Back Bay
Youre very much off course

SHARPE
Not at all my dear Miss Cushing Ive
found you havent I I dont think I can
brave the best of Boston society without
you as my guide

EDITH

Miss Eunice Walker I believe will be
waiting for you With open arms

( )

SHARPE
The devil take Miss Eunice Walker
Please am I to make a wretch of myself
Am I to beg-

Sharpe kneels among the puddles

SHARPE (CONTD)
Im lost in a strange city A child- a
mere child And I desperately need your
help

EDITH
(smiling now)
Help with what

SHARPE
Well the language for one As you see
I dont speak a word of American

Edith laughs She glances back into the room where Sharpes
model drill lies in pieces on the floor

EDITH
I dont know Mr Sharpe Tonights
already been somewhat strange For

whatever reason Im seeing things

SHARPE
Wonderful Come with me and well see
them together

CUT TO

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

All of Boston society is seated in a ballroom where a piano
recital is underway In the audience Eunice Walker her
mother and Society Girls 1 and 2

At the keyboard is a striking blonde WOMAN with chiseled
features and an intense air of concentration This is
LUCILLE SHARPE 40 Thomas sister She concludes a
brilliant Chopin Polonaise and stands to acknowledge the
APPLAUSE

Eunice brings her an armful of roses they exchange warm
kisses to renewed applause and approving murmurs

Taking a final bow Lucilles expression darkens her

brother has entered the room accompanied by a transformed
Edith

( )

A new BUZZ from the guests as they take notice Edith is a
vision of understated elegance in pale blue satin Seeing
her on Sharpes arm Eunice Walker and her mother are
crestfallen

Cushing leaves his seat and hurries over to his daughter As
he acknowledges Sharpe

CUSHING
I congratulate you sir Only remarkable
persistence could bring my daughter
out of her cave

SHARPE
Glad to be of service Mr Cushing Like
her father she was not easily moved

CUSHING
None of us are Mr Sharpe What did he
promise you Edith

EDITH
Nothing father Im just more pliable
than you

Dr McMichael approaches dazzled by her appearance

EDITH (CONTD)
Hello Alan May I introduce Sir Thomas
Sharpe
(to Sharpe)
This is Dr McMichael The man to see in
Boston if youre feeling poorly

DR MCMICHAEL
Thats quite a glowing presentation

Edith-

EDITH
Hes brilliant If you have aches and
pains-

Dr McMichael lowers his head even more disappointed at
this

SHARPE
But Ive never felt better Miss Cushing
thanks to you
(shaking the Doctors hand)
A pleasure to meet you sir under any
circumstances

( )

Outside - a brief flicker of LIGHTNING and more THUNDER
rolls over the city An exclamation from the crowd as the
room GOES DARK

SERVANTS scurry to light candelabras which give the room a
romantic and mysterious glow

The befuddled hostess MRS WALKER brings the beautiful
blonde pianist over to them But as she moves through the
room a Shadow seems to follow

and within it Edith sees a pair of pinprick eyes
glittering in a sallow face She recoils again recognizing
the ghost of her mother

But the stout and imposing Mrs Walker blocks her view

MRS WALKER
Good evening Sir Thomas you honor us
Welcome to our fair city

SHARPE
Im sorry were late

He kisses Mrs Walkers hand

MRS WALKER
Oh a kiss How very rare that is today
Eunice cant wait to say hello
(turning to Edith)
Edith What a surprise Seeing you
sparkle

As the ghostly image of her mother blurs and rises toward
the ceiling a flustered Edith tries to collect herself
Lucille is watching her closely

MRS WALKER (CONTD)
Our magnificent pianist is Lucille
Sharpe whos come with her brother all
the way from Cumberland in England- or
is it Scotland

LUCILLE
Ah That thorny question dates back to
before the Norman conquest

EDITH

Its in Northern England Mrs Walker
made famous by Mr Wordsworth

( )

LUCILLE
Exactly Miss Cushing Although Dove
Cottage is a long long way from where we
live

Mrs Walker takes Sharpe by the arm and leads him away

MRS WALKER
Eunice is here Mr Sharpe waiting in
the dark with her friends They insist on
hearing your wonderful accent
(beat)
Of course weve heard English accents
before but yours is so- so- very

Thomas is quickly surrounded by a cloud of excited young
women Eunice shoulders her way to the front of the pack

LUCILLE
(to Edith)
All that adoration He positively basks
in it

Ediths eyes dart over the room ready for another
apparition

EDITH
Word travels quickly in Boston Among the
young females anyway

LUCILLE
Do you not count yourself among them

Edith hears the womans delicate sarcasm and finally turns
to face her

EDITH
It is your brother Miss Sharpe who
sought me out Left to my own devices I
avoid parties like this and the waspish
women who flourish here

A small string ORCHESTRA starts playing a stately
passacaglia the servants clear the chairs from the dance
floor

Thomas frees himself from the girls and bows to Edith Mrs
Walker and Eunice look on losing all hope

SHARPE

Miss Cushing You came this far - will
you venture a few steps further

( )

EDITH
Im not much of a dancer Mr Sharpe

SHARPE
Could I be the judge of that

He escorts her onto the dance floor

DANCING

--where two concentric circles of GUESTS move rhythmically
clockwise and counterclockwise The steps are formal and
controlled each GUEST holds a LIT CANDLE

Sharpe grabs two candles — for Edith and one for himself
They join the outermost circle

All the while Edith keeps a wary distracted eye on the
darkest corners Sharpe is amused

SHARPE
Miss Cushing Whatever are you searching
for Here I am

Embarrassed Edith gazes into his eyes

EDITH
I - Im sorry I told you I was seeing
things tonight

The guests keep moving while the music lasts each one
guarding his or her flame jealously Its a game not unlike
musical chairs

Suddenly the MUSIC stops JOYOUS CHAOS Everybody covers his
own candle while trying to blow out others The last person
holding a lit candle will win

The two circles shrink accordingly The dancing resumes

EDITH (CONT’D)
Look at all those long faces Eunice my
father and your sister

SHARPE

Lucille She just likes to worry Any
girl who crosses my path - she stands
guard

The music stops again and the circles shrink some more Now
only four couples remain- amongst them SHARPE and EDITH

( )

EDITH
Maybe it was a mistake letting you drag
me out here Mrs Walker looks furious-

SHARPE
Just close your eyes then

EDITH
And if I close them what They wont see
me

SHARPE

Precisely Wont you try it

Edith closes her eyes and lets Sharpe guide her round and
round until the music stops More candles go out

Now only ONE couple remains Sharpe and Edith They start
dancing again staring into each others eyes

The music ceases for the last time and -after a collective
gasp- the room falls silent Two flames left WHAT WILL
HAPPEN

Sharpe blows his own flame out and bows to Edith She in
turn blows out her candle and the room explodes in
applause

Everybody is delighted
Everybody except MR CUSHING

FADE OUT

FADE IN

INT EDITHS ROOM - DAY

A SERVANT places a breakfast tray on a table in Ediths
bedroom Edith in a dressing gown is scribbling away with
a growing stack of manuscript pages at her elbow

EDITH (VO)
So a new book took shape All about a
young mans quest to fulfill the legacy
of a once-great family Id never thought
much about the travails of the well-born
Fortunately Sir Thomas delayed his
departure again and again

( )

Edith puts down her pen opens the heavy drapes she lets
the sunlight flood her room

EXT RIVER BANK — DAY

Edith and Sharpe are picnicking on the banks of the Charles
River As Sharpe reads a few pages of Ediths manuscript

SHARPE
This fellow Cavendish - your hero -
has he no fears No doubts

EDITH
Of course he does Hes haunted by his
ancestors Youll see

SHARPE
Haunted Literally

EDITH
No ghosts this time Ive banished them
from my fiction But they have visited
me they really have

He takes a snapshot of Edith with a KODAK BROWNIE BOX
CAMERA CLICK

INT ART GALLERY - DAY

At an exhibition of French Symbolist paintings Edith and
Sharpe stop to admire a strange dreamlike work by Odilon
Redon

EDITH
Why should it be so hard to believe If
one goes by experience and testimonies
more people have seen Ghosts than
kangaroos And yet we firnly believe in
Kangaroos

Sharpe laughs and brings up his Kodak CLICK

EXT BOSTON COMMON - DAY

In the park a BRASS BAND is playing a Sunday concert
Dozens of well-dressed Bostonians are seated on lawn chairs
enjoying some John Philip Sousa

Edith and Sharpe stand off to one side in the shade of an
elm tree As he takes another SNAPSHOT

( )

FH

EDITH
To my mind certain dismal places -
houses castles battlefields - they can
store and preserve the pain of their
deceased inhabitants Like a wax cylinder
and its recorded voices

SHARPE
And wed need Mr Edison to play them
back -

EDITH

Stop laughing at me That is the whole
point some people can play back those
images and sounds- some others dont
have the sensibility-

Sharpe notices a couple of familiar faces in the crowd

SHARPE
Oh no - its the Walker women They
havent seen us-—

But Mrs Walker and her daughter Eunice are waving at them

EDITH
They have And hope springs eternal
Come well join them- Eunice can teach
me how to charm-

Sharpe takes her by the arm leading her to the exit
SHARPE
You Miss Cushing need no help in that
department Let us away while theres
still time
INT OUTER OFFICE - NIGHT

A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE is trundling through the freight yard
below its bell CLANGING in the darkness

Edith is alone at Janes desk typing up the latest chapter
of her manuscript Ready to go home her father emerges from
his office and sits down regarding her as she works When
she pauses

CUSHING
Going well I see Your love story

She nods and resumes typing

( )

HF HH

CUSHING (CONT’D)
Has someone swept you off your feet by
any chance

Edith stops typing and looks him in the eye

EDITH
Let me assure you father Thomas Sharpe
is a literary godsend Nothing more

CUSHING
Nevertheless youve invited him to the
house for tea

EDITH
What of it I owe him a debt of
gratitude

CUSHING

Youve made a conquest my dear whether
you know it or not Proceed with caution
thats all I ask

Edith has resumed her typing a pencil clenched between her
teeth Cushing studies her aware of her happiness

INT GREENHOUSE - DAY

The greenhouse is an elegant edifice of glass and steel
lush with flowers Edith smiles as TWO SERVANTS set out an
afternoon tea on a table near the entrance

EDITH
Its all beautiful Where is Mr Sharpe

SERVANT
I saw him in the orchid rows maam with
his sister

Edith nods and moves away She slows down as she hears
VOICES

LUCILLE (0S)
This is not what we agreed upon It is
not-—

SHARPE (0S)
What difference does it make to you
None It is my task- My duty- Is it so
wrong for me to decide how to go about
1t

( )

When Edith comes into view the discussion ends but Lucille
is visibly upset She storms out

SHARPE (CONTD)
(to Edith)
My sister- she is yet to grow accustomed
to your country Edith And shes tired
of my frustrations too I daresay she
has reached her limit

He sees a MANUSCRIPT in Ediths hands His expression
changes

SHARPE (CONTD)
No Dont tell me Youve finished
Chapter Three

She bursts out laughing as he playfully pulls it from her
fingers

Dawn breaks over the quiet city A few carriages move
through deserted streets

INT GENTLEMANS CLUB - POOL - CONTINUOUS

A swimming pool inside a domed space done up in Oriental
tiles and arches

Alone in the pool swimming laps is Cushing Even in late

middle age his steady strokes are witness to enormous
energy He climbs out

( )

CUSHING
Mr Holly I like the club first thing in
the morning I have it all to myself

A Negro SERVANT hands him a towel and robe

HOLLY
A great way to start the day sir-

CUSHING
Isnt it And perhaps a good time to end
certain things too

INT LOCKER ROOMS - DAY
Cushing towels away the water

CUSHING
I didnt expect to see you again so soon
Holly What am I to make of it Good news
or bad

HOLLY
I dont make such judgments Mr Cushing
I just gather the facts and leave the
rest to the client

Cushing opens the envelope and scans the contents which
include letters telegrams and yellowing civil transcripts

HOLLY (CONTD)
The English peerage and family tree was
easy enough to locate - as were the
property records all the way back to the
sixteen hundreds For the banking
information I relied on a colleague in
Manchester

One particular piece of paper catches Cushings attention
HOLLY (CONTD)
But that - that document The Civil
Registry - thats the real find

CUSHING examines a document emblazoned with the CUMBERLAND
SEAL - an EAGLE AND A MOUNTAIN

CUSHING
Youll have your money tomorrow Holly

SHARPE
May I thank you for this invitation Mr
Cushing Its most welcome - I know Ive

worried that it might not sit well with
you

CUSHING
It did not Ive been most displeased

CUSHING
Well perhaps you already know what your
little brother is about to learn The
truth will out

S LIBRARY - DAY

Cushing guides Sharpe and Lucille away from the other guests

and into his

private library He closes the door

CUSHING
Now Sir Thomas The first time we met
at my office-

SHARPE

CUSHING

I imagine it wasnt hard for you to
realize I didnt like you

( )

LUCILLE
You made that plain enough to him sir

SHARPE
Lucille- please

CUSHING
My daughter later on asked me why

SHARPE
Sir I am aware that in the business
world I have no advantage no position to
offer But-

CUSHING
But you love her is that what you mean
to say

SHARPE

Yes sir it is

CUSHING
Well as I said my daughter asked me why
I didnt like you Honestly at the time
I had no good answer But-

He pulls out the envelope from Mr Holly

CUSHING (CONTD)
Now I do

Lucille opens the envelope and a single glimpse of the seal
is enough Her face grows pale and rigid She turns to
Sharpe- who doesnt even look

SHARPE
Does she know

CUSHING
No But I will tell her if thats what it
takes to send you on your way

SHARPE

I am sure you wouldnt believe me but-
CUSHING

You love her I know Youre repeating

yourself

He hands him a check Sharpe and Lucille are both taken
aback by the amount

( )

CUSHING (CONTD)
Its more than generous I know and
theres a reason With that money you can
dig iron ore to your hearts content
Build that contraption of yours Whatever
- but it will keep you far from her

HH

Then he gives them two STEAMSHIP TICKETS

CUSHING (CONTD)
The Majestic is sailing for Southampton
on Friday If you want to keep the
money

(beat)

Youd better be on it Otherwise that
check wont clear and one way or
another Ill have the law on you both
Whatever continent youre on

Now-

(beat)
As for my daughter Without further ado-
You dear sir

(beat)
--are going to break her heart

INT DINING ROOM - DAY

At the long table Sharpe and his sister are the guests of
honor

CUSHING
(raising his glass)
May I propose a toast of farewell A bon
voyage to Bostons questing baronet and
his musical sister A safe journey to you
both

Edith stares in shock at her father - then at Sharpe Shes
devastated

Sharpe gets to his feet

( )

SHARPE
Thank you sir When I came to America
my heart was brimming with a sense of
adventure Here the future actually means
something

(beat)
And although I found no financial success
in Boston -

He looks straight at Edith his gaze sad and steady
SHARPE (CONTD)

- I have found warmth and friendship
among you all And for that I am

grateful

(beat)
So for now farewell May we meet again
soon

INT PARLOR - LATER

Chattering happily the guests mingle in the sumptuous
parlor Sharpe approaches Edith

EDITH
So - you are leaving us now You might
have told me

SHARPE
I didnt know how Youre aware of my
situation Nothing holds me in America
any longer

EDITH
Nothing I see

He hands over her manuscript

SHARPE
Heres your chapter three
EDITH
And
SHARPE
(a shrug)

Your description of the garden the maze
behind the mill- its poetic
evocative

EDITH
Thank you

( )

SHARPE
And quite unnecessary

Sharpe eyes Cushing who observes from a distance Sharpe
feels pressured

EDITH
Pray elaborate

SHARPE
All of it The last ten pages The whole
chapter I would cut it all Wouldnt
miss a thing

EDITH
But we want to know if shes going to
find his letter-

SHARPE
Do we really I dont think so- no-
(beat)
For the life of me I cannot understand
why you consider yourself a writer- The
plot is banal to put it plainly

EDITH
Its not the tale Mr Sharpe but how you
tell it-

SHARPE

Precisely my point Weve all read this
tale- and many others like it A romance
gone wrong

(he shakes his head)
I advise you to return to your ghost

stories
EDITH
(aghast)
I thank you then for your frankness
sir

Sharpe goes on struggling with himself but unable to stop

SHARPE
--but you dont have anything to say-
about the natural or the supernatural do
you

EDITH
Stop- let me be-

( )

SHARPE
Writing about life the aches that you
describe with such earnestness the
pain- the loss the love You have not
lived at all In fact you seem to know
only what other writers tell you How can
you even presume to feel-

EDITH
Enough Youve made yourself more than
plain

SHARPE

-how it hurts to be alone and desperate
All from your comfortable nest in-

She slaps him silencing him The party guests gasp and
stare as she flees the room Sharpe is devastated - but
Cushing smiles

CUT TO

INT EDITHS ROOM - NIGHT
Its late and dark Edith lies in bed wiping at her tears

The floorboards creak softly The curtains move and the
bedsprings go down Edith freezes her eyes wide her head
turned away

Her fathers hand caresses her hair

CUSHING
I am not blind Edith - Im not I know
you had feelings for him But give it
time You shouldnt be afraid of being
alone-

(beat)
You still have me Perhaps you and I-
we could go to the West coast A season
in San Francisco You could write and I-

Good night Father I love you - but good
night-

The old man leaves her

ATTENDANT
Just the way you like it Mr Cushing
sir-
CUSHING

Very well then Be kind enough to order
me some ham and eggs Ill start with
coffee if its hot -

ATTENDANT
Right away sir

As he leaves Cushing kneels to test the water

A FIGURE comes up behind him When Cushing turns he smiles
in surprise Then its too late

WHACK The figure has clubbed him with a BUTCHERS HAMMER
Cushing staggers then goes down The FIGURE stands over
him grabs his head and smashes it again and again against
the TILED CORNER of the POOL

The body rolls into the water with a soft SPLASH The
assailant withdraws

Cushings body rocks gently back and forth his fractured
skull oozing a plume of blood into the pristine water

The attendant walks back in sees the body and drops his
tray of coffee

INT LIBRARY — DAY

Edith walks through the stacks of the Boston Public Library
checking some Dewey decimal numbers scrawled on the last
page of her chapter three

Finally she locates the numbered volume a copy of Jane
Eyre Opening it up she finds a letter from Sharpe

( )

SHARPE (VO)
Dear Edith By the time you read this I
will be gone So these words are my only
chance to tell you how much you mean to
me Your father asked me to break your
heart and leave you

Edith blinks and reads on as a SHADOW gathers behind her

SHARPE (VO)
By this time surely I have accomplished
both But know this I leave only because
of my present station in life I shall
change it Even if it takes years I
shall change it - and when I can prove to
your father that all I ask of him is his
consent - nothing more - then and only
then will I come back for you Forever
Thomas Sharpe

Edith turns headed for the stairs But a dead woman is
there Its her mother - raising an arm as if to block her
way

This time Edith sees a once-beautiful face which is now a
decomposing horror Edith drops the book and flees

EXT DOCKS - DAY

Edith runs down a busy dock pushing her way through a crowd
of STEVEDORES and waving FAMILIES

But its too late By the time she arrives at the gangplank
the Majestic has set sail

She stands there panting defeated watching the UNION JACK
on its stern receding

But little by little she becomes aware of another presence
standing close by Its Sharpe

Disturbed flustered Edith backs away He follows closely
SHARPE
It seems I missed my ship On purpose
Edith My sister - shes on board - but I
couldnt go - not yet

EDITH
When then When do you leave

( )

SHARPE
I dont know - I truly dont-
EDITH
What do you mean If you dont know who
does
SHARPE

You Edith Only you know

He pulls her close and kisses her Edith is thrilled She
pulls away

EDITH
And what about my book Is it so awful

SHARPE
I loved every word You must finish it

idling A chauffeured black MOTOR CAR pulls up behind it

Edith and Sharpe are in the taxi locked in a passionate
embrace A sudden KNOCK on the window Ferguson the
LAWYER- opens the door

Edith takes one look at him and knows something terrible has
happened

INT HOSPITAL —- DAY

A CORONER leads Edith Sharpe and Ferguson down a hospital
corridor

Dr McMichael appears behind them hurrying to catch up

DR MCMICHAEL
(looking stricken)
Edith Im so sorry - its
incomprehensible - I cant believe it
how could such a thing happen- He was a
dear friend you know that-

( )

He falters Edith is in shock holding back her tears The
coroner opens the door to the morgue Before she can enter

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Edith Wait
(to the coroner)
Ill give you a positive identification
No need for Miss Cushing to see him I
was his physician

FERGUSON
And I am his lawyer Dr McMichael I am
sorry- its a legal formality
Obligatory Im afraid

CORONER
(regards Edith closely)
You must concentrate on the features that
remain intact Miss Dont fix upon
broken things things out of place-

INT MORGUE - MOMENTS LATER

They have gathered around a draped cadaver on a steel table
The coroner pulls back the sheet hiding the corpse from
CAMERA but revealing it to Edith

She fights back her tears as Sharpe comes alongside
steadying her The coroner addresses them

CORONER
As the sole surviving relative you could
request an autopsy but in this case I
dont think its necessary An accident -
the floor was wet -

FERGUSON
Ah Of course He slipped

Dr McMichael gazes intently at the corpse frowning at what
he sees

DR MCMICHAEL
(to the coroner)
May I sir

As he inspects the dead mans skull
EDITH
Get away from him- This is my father- my-

father- my father
(MORE )

( )

EDITH (CONTD)
He - he- is turning sixty next week - and
he is- he is afraid of it showing-
(breaks )
Afraid of looking his age you see

She struggles to go on

EDITH (CONT’D)
Thats why he- he dresses so well- Thats
why he swims every day- thats why- He
loves taking long walks with me- He loves
it- He loves me-
(beat)
And now I am alone

And as she says this she finally crumbles

DISSOLVE TO

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

Once again Edith is in black and surrounded by mourners at
the Cushing burial plot A fresh grave lies open next to her
mothers granite tombstone

As the REVEREND reads a passage from the Bible (MOS) Edith
leans on Sharpes arm A large DIAMOND RING sparkles on her
finger

A bereft-looking Dr McMichael is standing in the crowd
staring fixedly at Sharpe Its a duel- but then with a
gentlemanly tip of Dr McMichaels hat its over

Before the diggers close up the grave Edith steps forward
and drops Cushings pocket watch onto the coffin

EDITH (VO)
Within a few short weeks the very same
guests who mourned my fathers passing
attended my wedding at Trinity Church

felt

INT STATEROOM - NIGHT
The first-class stateroom is filled with FLOWERS

EDITH (VO)
--that by his side I could face any
horror in the world And I would - in
time - face all of them

Edith emerges from the bathroom her body backlit through a
sheer negligée As she slips into bed Sharpe places a
wooden case by her side

EDITH
What pray tell is that

SHARPE
A surprise Open it -

EDITH
What -

Sharpe proceeds to unlock the case

SHARPE
I wracked my brains for a suitable
wedding present As usual Lucille came
to the rescue Her idea -
(he gestures to the case)
- I daresay will prove useful

Its a TYPEWRITER

EDITH
(bursts out laughing)
Oh how perfect
(kissing him)
Thank you Thomas I love it Shall I try
it out Right now -

SHARPE
It can wait until morning I think
Youll have more to write about

He kisses her As their embrace becomes passionate he lifts
off the nightgown and they begin to make love

INT CUSHINGS LIBRARY - DAY

MOVING MEN are carting off the contents of Cushings home
and loading a horse-drawn dray outside

Dr McMichael is seated at Cushings desk transferring the
contents of the drawers into a carton

One packet of papers attracts his attention The TOP of a
page pokes out of an envelope It is emblazoned with the
Cumberland eagle and a mountain This is the file from

As the young Doctor unfolds it he finds that the rest of
the page has been torn off

EXT CUMBERLAND HILLS - DAY

A Rochet-Schneider HORSELESS CARRIAGE putters over the
barren snow-covered hills of rural Cumberland No one else
is on the road a few woolly sheep browse the icy slopes

Sharpe is at the wheel with Edith sitting beside him
wrapped in furs and a lap blanket

At a lonely crossroads they make a turn following a line
of power poles A weathered signpost reads SHARPETON 5 mi

EXT ABANDONED VILLAGE - DAY

Sharpeton is nothing but a cluster of abandoned stone
cottages

SHARPE
Once the mine closed everyone left
except us The family motto is Semper
Pertinax-

EDITH
Always Stubborn

SHARPE
To a fault

Edith can see a grand house brooding up in the hills its
many chimneys silhouetted against the gray sky

( )

A FLOCK OF SHEEP crosses in front of the car

followed by a

sheepdog Then an arthritic SHEPHERD in tattered clothing

runs up saluting Sharpe with his crook

SHARPE (CONTD)

Hello Finlay How have you been keeping

Finlays leathery whiskered face is earnest and attentive

but his blue eyes are cloudy with cataracts

FINLAY

Never better Sir Thomas I knew it was

you a mile off

SHARPE
(as if talking to a child)

Finlay this is my wife Edith We were
married in Boston Massachusetts - thats
on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean

FINLAY

I know I know milord You are married

(to Edith)

Welcome back Lady Sharpe Mein Name ist

William wie sind Sie heute
(he nods satisfied)
There I learned it

He hurries into one of the stone hovels near the road

EDITH
What on earth Was he speaking German
SHARPE
Of a kind Im sorry
(embarrassed)

Hes been here forever - he worked for my
parents The soul of generosity We help

him when we can

Finlay emerges with a beautifully carved WOODEN LAMB He

hands it to Edith

FINLAY

Here this is for you mum Another one

SHARPE
(uneasy)

Why thank you Finlay Very fine work

as always

( )

EDITH
But - its beautiful Did you make it
yourself
FINLAY
(nodding)

Thats little Scrub She answers to
Scrub shes the baby of the family Put
her with the rest of the flock theyll
treat her right

He touches his cap and Sharpe drives on As Finlay recedes
from view

EDITH
Was he always like that

SHARPE
More or less The whiskey didnt help

THE SHARPE MANSION

The car proceeds under an arch with wrought-iron letters
CLOUD TOP As they motor up a long steep driveway Edith
leans forward peering through the windshield at the
imposing house

EDITH
But its enormous

SHARPE
It does swallow one up But we love it
anyway - and you will too youll see

A cute little DOG frisks around the car as they stop at the
front steps Edith gets out and picks up the dog

EDITH
And who is this You never told me about
him
(laughing)

Or is he a she

Sharpes chuckle is awkward almost confused SOMETHINGs
WRONG he hadnt expected this

SHARPE
I - Ill just let you guess -

He TOOTS the car horn and glances at the house but theres
no other sign of life

INT FOYER - DUSK

Sharpe unlocks the massive oaken front door and Edith peeks
uncertainly into the foyer She shrieks as Sharpe playfully
grabs her around the waist and lifts her through the portal

The dog barks in excitement as he carries her inside
Setting her down

SHARPE
Welcome home my Lady

The gloomy FOYER is paneled in dark wood Just beyond it a
staircase climbs through three open floors and jutting
balconies At its center a caged elevator
Edith wanders uncertainly like Jonah inside the whale
SHARPE (CONTD)
(calling out)
Lucille

He tries a wall switch no lights

SHARPE (CONTD)
Lucille

He exits the foyer
SHARPE (CONTD)
The electric service is new - wait here

Ill only be a moment

Edith becomes aware that the dog has grown quiet its tail
curls between its legs

Shivering Edith pulls her coat tight around her Behind
her the door blows shut with a soft BOOM Even darker now

Somewhere a FLY is buzzing

A motionless silhouetted WOMAN in black is in an adjoining
passageway She stands straight with preternatural dignity

EDITH
Lucille

The womans pince-nez glasses gleam a diamond RING flashes
on her finger The dog GROWLS

Just then the wall sconces blaze up in a warm and cheerful
light Sharpe reappears wiping his hands on a rag

( )

SHARPE
I have no idea what Im doing with fuses
and the like Electricity is the work of
the devil -

(beat)
We keep a box of candles in every room
and now you know why -

Edith seizes his arm spinning him around to face the woman -
gone now

SHARPE (CONTD)
What is it

EDITH
I saw somebody -

SHARPE
Somebody Dont be silly Were alone
here - theres not a living soul for
miles Unless you count Finlay and his
flock

EDITH
Wh- wheres your sister

Sharpe presses a brass CALL BUTTON Somewhere below
machinery WHIRS CABLES move

SHARPE
Shell be upstairs Come - heres the
lift

The CAGED LIFT rises into view

SHARPE (CONTD)
It goes to all the floors and down two
levels to the old mine offices
(beat)
Dont ever go below this floor all
right No place for you

UPSTAIRS

At the far end of a cavernous grand stairwell Sharpe and
Edith exit the elevator and proceed down the murky hall

SHARPE
Lucille

THEIR BEDROOM

Heavy furniture and floral wallpaper A fireplace in the
corner Sharpe deposits the cases on the four-poster bed

SHARPE
Ill get a fire going Once its lit
this room stays toasty warm -

Edith places Finlays hand-carved lamb on a shelf then

draws back a curtain revealing barren dark hills

overlooking a valley hundreds of feet below A few

snowflakes are drifting down
SHARPE (CONTD)

Lucille may be in the coal shed Or the

garage Ill just go see

He leaves Pleased with the room Edith removes her hat and
gloves then goes to the mirror where she takes a moment to
gaze at her reflection
With a coquettish smile she takes off her eyeglasses
EDITH
Lady Sharpe do you take milk or lemon
Wont you try a nice warm scone

She becomes aware of a few drowsy HOUSEFLIES vibrating -
agonizing - on the windowsill

She opens the window and shoos them outside catching sight
of Sharpe headed for a garage at the side of the house

With a grin she opens her mouth to call out to him But-

VOICE
Edith Get out

Edith whirls around - shes alone

CORRIDOR

Coming out into the hall without her glasses Edith
squints

A faint CLUNK and the WHINE of machinery Down the hall the
elevator cables are moving

A moment later the cab comes up a WOMAN is on board

( )

EDITH
(relieved)
Lucille Weve been-

The elevator door opens revealing

a walking horror with wild grey hair tumbled over naked
shrunken breasts The womans tongue lips and throat are
stained black her eyes are pits of darkness

WOMAN
Leave us- Now

Edith covers her face as the skeletal figure reaches for
her RIP - A three-inch tear appears on Ediths blouse

Stifling a cry Edith runs in the other direction colliding
with Sharpe whos coming up the stairs

EDITH
Who was that - Oh my God Thomas - Who
in Gods name is that woman Who else
is in this house

SHARPE
Shhh Edith- Lucilles nowhere to be -
EDITH
Not Lucille Someone else just now And -
(pointing)

- she came up on that - you saw it coming
up the elevator

Sharpe puts his hands on her shoulders and smiles

SHARPE
Edith please- calm down- I have no idea
what—

EDITH

Look - it tore my blouse I felt it

SHARPE
What have you done Good lord Here let
me show you something Come -

He leads her into the elevator cab Points at a mirror on
the back wall inside the cab

SHARPE (CONTD)
A rusty silver mirror - rotting away
thats all - and you my darling without
your glasses

Edith looks at her reflection
EDITH

No - thats not it Thomas I - Im

scared-
SHARPE

Shh- Shh- Come

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

On board the lift Sharpe closes the glass doors and moves
the brass lever downward As they slowly descend

SHARPE
Now This thing has a mind of its own In
fact I prefer the stairs In our
mothers day it was operated by half a
dozen servants in the basement hauling
on ropes Lucille had it motorized and
its been quite a comedy ever since

Through the glass panels Edith can see the foyer coming up
under her feet

EDITH
I want to leave please This - this is
one of those places I can feel it- a
container full of souls in pain hateful
creatures
SHARPE
Ah- your love affair with ghosts Here
in the very house where I grew up I
should be offended-

He centers the lever and the elevator gently stops He opens
the door revealing the dark shape of another WOMAN

Edith leaps back -

INT FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Its Lucille Sharpe in gloves and heavy woolens mustering
a chilly smile

LUCILLE
There you are The two weary travelers
So Edith welcome to Cloud Top Hullo

Lucille throws off her cape and shakes off some snowflakes

LUCILLE

Edith covers

LUCILLE

THOMAS
She saw something - a shadow a
reflection -
LUCILLE
(to Edith)

And it tore your dress

THOMAS

As you see Its a presence am I right
darling Ghosts shades or whatnot whose
souls are imprinted within the walls
Stored there if I understand correctly

her face with her hand feeling a fool
EDITH
(bracing up)
Piffle Ive gone mad It never happened
LUCILLE
Youre overtired - after such a long

journey

EDITH
Not a bit

condolences on his passing - so tragic

EDITH

I need a proper welcome thats all

She embraces her sister-in-law

EDITH (CONTD)

From this day forward this house will
contain nothing but warmth friendship

Over Ediths shoulder Sharpe locks eyes with Lucille

LUCILLE

Hear hear And congratulations Edith

What a beautiful bride you are

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT

In a raised bay in the Sharpe library Lucille is seated at
a GRAND PIANO playing with her usual concentration

Sipping a BRANDY Edith strolls around the magnificent
double-height room which is crowded with books and glass
cabinets Oil portraits stare down from the walls stuffed
animals mingle with other souvenirs of a well-traveled

family

A stained-glass window bears a family coat-of-arms Semper

Pertinax

SHARPE
Do you like it

EDITH
I do its almost a church

SHARPE
I spent my childhood in here

The dog trots into the room going directly to Edith

( )

ee HF

EDITH
Lucille what is the dogs name I seem
to have a new and faithful companion-

Lucilles eyes are closed as she plays the Chopin

LUCILLE
The dog has no name Its a stray we
have no plans to keep it

The dog leads Edith to a stack of GERMAN BOOKS on the floor
She picks one up and looks at the flyleaf

EDITH
And these books are in German-

Lucille stops her piano playing

LUCILLE
Those books belonged to a house guest Do
you read German Edith

EDITH
A few words thats all

LUCILLE
(to Sharpe)
Ive been wanting to donate them to the
local library havent I Thomas- No
reason to keep them here

INSERT
The bookplate reads Von der Sammlung von Eleanora Schott

Below the womans signature in an elegant Continental
hand And the year 1897

BACK TO SCENE
Edith sniffs the book noting the scent of perfume
EDITH
And the piano Lucille is this where you
learned to play
LUCILLE
Not really I was sent away We both

were in actual fact Separated

Edith is puzzled she looks at her husband

EDITH

But why Such a cruel thing - whose idea

quality portrait of

an imposing woman in pearls silk an ivory cane and pince-

nez glasses

his rumpled hair and sleepy grin he looks like an impish
boy

SHARPE

Edith its far too early for any of your

EDITH
Wait for what my love

Sharpe draws back the down quilt inviting her to return to
bed

SHARPE
For further inspiration Come

EXT VILLAGE STREET - DAY

Horse-drawn FARM WAGONS and local PEDESTRIANS crowd the town
center on a cold wet afternoon

Sharpe steers his car to a stop outside a FREIGHT OFFICE in
the high street

As a SHIPPING AGENT appears to usher him inside Edith and
Lucille exit the car Lucille disappears into an adjacent
DRY GOODS STORE Edith heads for the POST OFFICE across the
street

INT POST OFFICE - DAY

At the counter the POSTAL CLERK affixes a stamp onto
Ediths reply to Ferguson As Edith counts out some coins
the clerk notes her name on the return address

POSTAL CLERK
Youre Lady Sharpe then Forgive me
mum but theres a letter come in for you
just this morning

He disappears for a moment then returns with an envelope
Handing it to her

POSTAL CLERK (CONT’D)
All the way from Germany

Edith frowns looking at the address written in an elegant
cursive hand
Lady E Sharpe
Poste Restante Strathney

POSTAL CLERK (CONT’D)
Is there anything the matter mum

Edith is examining the postmark Leipzig

EDITH
No nothing at all Thank you so much

She tucks the letter into her handbag then sees a happy
Sharpe waving to her from the barn-like freight depot across
the street

INT DEPOT - DAY

At a loading dock Sharpe proudly shows Edith the contents

of several OPEN CRATES

Packed in sisal gleaming GEA

As the body dies- as its organs shut
down a weight change occurs It loses
exactly 21 grams

CUT TO

INT BOSTON MEDICAL SCHOOL OPERATING THEATRE - DAY

DR MCMICHAEL
People of faith claim this is the weight
of the soul leaving the body but I urge
you as men of science to dismiss such a
notion

The Doctor lectures in an operating theatre where a body
lies before him flayed open In the gallery dozens of
students take notes and make sketches

DR MCMICHAEL (CONTD)
Physical humours evaporate secretions
leave the body through open pores- that
and the air leaving the lungs This is
what you must look for gentleman Not
faith not magic just science

CAMERA singles out a man seated among the students the
lawyer Mr Ferguson As Dr McMichael sees him

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)
We must question every detail before

INT GENTLEMANS CLUB TEA ROOM - DAY
Tea is being served to Dr McMichael and Ferguson

FERGUSON
It all seems to have ended well enough
Edith seems to have found happiness
dont you agree

DR MCMICHAEL
I havent had a word

FERGUSON
Damn thats a shame
(pause)
Well I have
(MORE )

( )

FERGUSON (CONTD)
Nothing personal of course Per her
instructions Im liquidating all the
family assets

DR MCMICHAEL
Are you really

FERGUSON
Quite unusual She may be investing every
penny Those iron mines of his-
(speaking quietly)
If I might confide-

Dr McMichael puts down his tea leaning close

FERGUSON (CONT’D)
Before Cushing died he hired a New York
man a Mr Holly- very hard to track
down He digs up unsavory facts haunts
places not suitable for a gentleman The
very fact that Holly was involved gives
me pause

DR MCMICHAEL
Im not sure I follow-

FERGUSON
Cushing was no fool And he liked you
Doctor- he did He always mentioned you
as someone worthy of his trust- and his
daughter

Ferguson writes something on the back of a card

FERGUSON (CONT’D (CONT’D)
Now its clear that Cushing had his
doubts about Sharpe I myself would love
to visit Edith- wish her the best Seeing
as I have her address

He passes the Doctor the card

FERGUSON (CONT’D)
But I am old and tired A trip like that
requires some stamina
(beat)
If you are the man Cushing believed you
to be you should be the one making
that house call

EXT HOUSE - DAY

A steady SNOWFALL is transforming the vast landscape A
couple inches have already covered the house and its many
gables

INT BATHROOM —- DAY

Steam billows in the vast tile bathroom as Edith waits for
the tub to fill with hot water She opens the envelope from
Leipzig and finds a letter written in German

EDITH
(reading)
Mein liebe Eleanor

Puzzled she sets it aside drops her robe and gets into the
bath Gazing at the wedding ring on her finger she grows
dreamy until

she sees a FLY crawling on the window pane

A sudden RASP at the door makes her jump - but its only the
dog scratching It enters and sits then turns its head
as the fly zooms past

SNAP The little dogs jaws click shut on the insect GULP -
down it goes The dogs pink tongue appears licking its
chops

Edith laughs

INT KITCHEN - DAY

In the cavernous skylighted kitchen Lucille is at the
stove which is as large as a hay wagon

Edith enters the dog in her arms

EDITH
Good morning Lucille

LUCILLE
Good morning Ive made porridge if
youll eat it

EDITH
But thats awful Lucille - I mean you
making my breakfast Here let me do

something

( )

She puts down the dog and heads for the stove
LUCILLE
No And I prefer the dog be kept out of
the kitchen

Edith scoots the dog into the hall closes the door and
smiles politely

EDITH
There Gone Where is Thomas

Lucilles eyes look tired and distant

LUCILLE
In the garage assembling that thing of
his

EDITH

Lucille dont tell me youre a skeptic

LUCILLE
Its a pipe dream an utter waste of
money I long ago accustomed myself to
the reality of our situation - Thomas
never has Do you prefer coffee or tea

EDITH
Lucille Ill not have you cook my meals
and do for me in any other way Believe
it or not I know my way around a
kitchen

Pause Then Lucille nods in understanding brushing back a
lock of hair

LUCILLE
Forgive me Im a sour old thing in the
morning Let me warn you however
theres more than enough work here for
everyone- no servants- we cant afford
them

EDITH
Soon we will Fathers assets are being
transferred here With a house this
grand that money will be put to good
practical use- I think hed be pleased

Edith checks the fire under one of the cast-iron platters
She picks up the coal scuttle

( )

FH

EDITH (CONT’D)
So Wheres the coal kept

No answer from Lucille whose face has again grown stony
LUCILLE
Edith Did you tell my brother about this
bank transfer
EDITH
(nodding)
It was in Mr Fergusons letter Thomas
hasnt mentioned it
LUCILLE
(dry)
No Not a word

INT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Edith comes down a gloomy frigid corridor behind the
kitchen A dark SHAPE darts out at her feet the dog again

It follows Edith to a small door the entrance to the coal
shed

INT GARAGE - SAME

In the cavernous garage Thomas is crouched beside a steam
boiler fitting a hose to a pressure gauge The senile
shepherd Finlay is there too sitting among the crates
singing to himself as he polishes a flywheel

Lucille enters wrapped up in a shawl

Sharpe looks up surprised

SHARPE
Where is she

LUCILLE
You and I must talk We keep nothing from
each other is that not so

INT COAL SHED - DAY

Coal is piled up against the rough wooden walls of the semi-
detached storage shed Frost covers the single small window

( )

Edith shivers she can see her breath
There are COBWEBS everywhere all of them dotted with dead
flies With a shovel Edith fills the coal scuttle then

turns to go No dog now

EDITH
Where are you Come doggie

A SIGH shakes the spider webs dead flies drop to the floor

In a matter of seconds it grows dark Edith looks out the
window - at a night sky with scudding moonlit clouds

Disbelieving Edith turns around a cloud of white VAPOR
hangs in the air
Still here

Edith backpedals as another sinuous strand of vapor gathers
before her

VOICE (CONTD)
Stupid creature

Edith grabs a handful of COAL DUST and flings it The black
particles settle on a YOUNG WOMANS FACE hovering in midair

The mouth is moving even as the glittering eyelids stay
shut

FACE
--leave ussss-

A CLANG as Edith drops the coal scuttle and trips on a
board She falls heavily - and looks up as

coal dust swirls and rains down upon her

INT GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER
Thomas and Lucilles conversation is interrupted by BARKING

The dog charges into the garage followed by Edith whose
hands and dress are filthy black

She hurtles past brother and sister to the Rochet-Schneider

motorcar Sharpe manages to stop her but she tears free
intent on getting behind the wheel

( )

SHARPE
Edith - Edith what is it

He forcibly turns her around her eyes finally focus on him
Then she looks around the garage becoming aware of where
she is

Guten tag guten tag alles

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Edith has taken refuge on the bed hiding like a child under
the quilt Sharpe is seated alongside her holding her hand

SHARPE
Your hands like ice Are you running a
fever - Look at me
(seeing her face)
What in Gods name-

She sits up and hugs him

EDITH
Thomas I saw a face - a woman she was
alive not a shadow not trick of the
light -

SHARPE
Whose face
(concerned)
Edith - shh Im here Did you recognize
her Was it someone you know

EDITH
No no - it was- a different woman this
time Young Blind In moonlight-

A TAP at the door and Lucille enters carrying a breakfast
tray Edith clings to Sharpe trying to regain control of
herself

SHARPE
(aghast)
Blind you say
EDITH
(nodding)
I know this much

Lucille sets the tray down on the bed

( )

EDITH (CONT’D)
(shuddering)
It wants me out of here

Hands shaking Edith takes a sip of tea

LUCILLE
Nonsense my dear Your arrival has
brought us hope

EDITH
What about me If I cant tell whats
real how can I stay here

She puts on a painful smile her hands are shaking

EDITH (CONTD)
Send the hysteric to Vienna Shes ready
for Dr Freud

LUCILLE
Never ever Cloud Top is your home now
And as dull as it sounds to the Austrian
alienists ours is a material world That
much is indisputable

From the hallway downstairs theres a BOOMING KNOCK on the
front door A TEAMSTER calls out

TEAMSTER (0S)
Hello the house

EXT DRIVEWAY - DAY

A horse-drawn DELIVERY VAN has pulled up out front Two
WORKMEN stomp through the snow unloading a shipment of
CRATES and TRUNKS

The elderly teamster doffs his cap when he spots Sharpe
throwing open the upstairs window

Finlay walks

TEAMSTER
‘Morning Sir Thomas Sorry were late -
the roads that bad over a foot here and
there

up with his sheepdog
FINLAY
With more snow coming

(to the teamster)
Hello Malcolm Anything for me

TEAMSTER
Could be Finlay could be Well take a
look

As Sharpe and the men converse (MOS)

EDITH (VO)

They said the arrival of my things from
home - my goods and chattels Thomas
called them - would calm me down I
didnt believe them but I decided I must
try

DISSOLVE TO

EXT VERANDAH - LATER

Wrapped in a heavy coat Edith stands on the front porch
surrounded by open crates sorting through her things as the
workmen carry lamps and vases inside

The teamster pauses to give Finlay a bottle of whiskey

TEAMSTER
Make it last now Might not see you for
weeks if the roads closed

FINLAY
Youre a godsend Malcolm

In a box full of books Edith comes upon her framed
childhood drawing of Crimson Peak

CRACK The glass in the frame SHATTERS Edith gasps
The teamster looks over her shoulder

TEAMSTER
Thats a shame mum Theres a shop in
Strathney can order you a new glass -
(noticing the caption)
Crimson Peak

EDITH
(recovering)
As a child I - I had an active
imagination This mountain had to be red
red red-

Fascinated Finlay seizes Edith by the arm and eagerly pulls
her along the verandah

( )

FINLAY
Crimson Peak Come see

CAMERA DOLLIES with them to reveal the hill behind the
house which is now snow-covered and glowing like an immense
ruby in the morning sun

TEAMSTER

Thank you Finlay
(explaining to Edith)

Color crimson on account of the ore
leaching up from below In summertime
its more of an orange-like but by
Winter the snow turns blood red

(beat)
Crimson Peak all the same Thats what us
locals call it-

Sharpe comes up holding a couple of Ediths books
SHARPE
Look darling we have the very same
edition of The Tales of Hoffmann -

He falls silent when he sees the expression on her face

TEAMSTER
Just a bit of broken glass sir

He indicates Ediths drawing behind the cracked glass

TEAMSTER (CONTD)
Quite a coincidence aint it

They all compare Ediths artwork to the real thing an
uncanny match Ediths mind is racing back to memories of
her mothers warning

TEAMSTER (CONTD)
Was Lady Sharpe here as a child sir Is
that it

Sharpe is looking with concern at Edith

EDITH

Its a coincidence - nothing more -
SHARPE

A blessing then A blessing Not a

coincidence

He embraces her But his face is troubled

Crimson Peak is a dull ruddy shape half hidden behind a
new heavy SNOWFALL

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to find Sharpe helping Lucille into the
motorcar in front of the house Edith is there to see them
off

(worried to Edith)
Will you not come with us Promise me you
wont summon forth new beings from the
netherworld-

EDITH
Shh Stop Im going to work like a
scholar Its high time I got back to the
book

SHARPE
Then write do you hear me You have a
whole day to yourself Make the most of
it

As they drive off Edith waves from the bottom of the snow-
covered front steps

She picks up the little dog and regards the front door open
and gaping as if ready to gobble her up

A gust of wind and the house moans Edith shivers then goes
inside and shuts the door
INT COAL SHED - DAY

Edith stands in the middle of the coal shed studying the
gloomy corners Silence

She loads the coal scuttle takes a defiant last look
around then leaves Outside the snow is piling up

The sound of TYPING

INT LIBRARY — DAY

The coal fire is glowing The faithful dog lies at Ediths
feet as she types translating the letter from Leipzig with
the aid of a GERMAN DICTIONARY

EDITH (VO)
Why dear cousin will you not answer
my letters Your little Lotte must be
walking and talking by now and still
no word of any kind What are your
English relatives doing to you

Edith lifts her eyes The oil portrait of the late Lady
Sharpe gazes down on her
AMONG THE BOOKS

Edith sits atop a rolling ladder just below the portrait
She moistens a handkerchief and rubs it on the canvas -

- exposing on the womans finger a diamond RING She
compares it to the ring shes wearing the same

The dogs BARK reaches her ears

INT FOYER - DAY

Edith walks through the foyer glancing up More barking
from upstairs

She finds herself at the lift

On impulse she gets in and moves the brass handle to up
CLUNK - the unseen electric motor whines and the cab raises
her out of view

INT UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR

From the doorway of a wood-paneled STUDY Edith surveys a
workbench strewn with metal parts and blueprints - all

relating to Sharpes miniature steam drill

Edith smiles at the chaos

A BEDROOM

Edith enters Lucilles austere sparsely-furnished bedroom
A framed PHOTO of brother and sister - younger posing arm
in arm on Brighton Pier - stands on the bedside table

At the desk she inspects a pile of ACCOUNT BOOKS LEGAL
PAPERS and a KEY RING Some of the documents are in German
including a letter from a bank in Leipzig

Edith comes upon an envelope with her name on it Edith
Cushing Boston 1900

In the envelope SNAPSHOTS of herself back in Boston - the
Kodak pictures taken by Sharpe

NURSERY

Using Lucilles key ring Edith unlocks a dusty room that
once served as a nursery The wallpaper features a parade of
merry animals A CRADLE and TOY CHEST occupy the corner near
the window

On a shelf near a dented silver rattle and christening cup
she finds a BLACK RUBBER BALL

THE CORRIDOR

In the corridor Edith hears the dog WHINING on the other
side of a heavy pair of double doors She tries the brass

knobs locked

Using another of Lucilles keys she opens the doors onto a
long-forgotten passageway

PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS

A few SNOWFLAKES drift in from a half-open skylight No sign
of the animal

As Edith latches the skylight shut a sudden YELP and the
dog is sitting at her feet

EDITH
There you are All right little girl
fetch

Edith throws the rubber ball With a BARK the dog takes off
after it disappearing into the gloom

( )

Then nothing

EDITH (CONTD)
Come on silly Come on

THUMP the ball comes bouncing back

Edith moves deeper into the frigid passageway moving in and
out of shafts of light from other skylights

EDITH (CONTD)
Here girl Here

She passes a stack of BRICKS large GLASS BOTTLES filled
with roofing nails an old wicker WHEELCHAIR and finally
reaches a rusty iron door only three feet high

Hearing SCRATCHING on the other side she kneels down and
tries the handle it wont move

EDITH (CONTD)
How did you get in there

The SCRATCHING becomes intense frenzied Edith looks down
and realizes the dog is sitting alongside her -

Flesh crawling she gathers up the dog and runs

INT CORRIDOR - DAY
Reaching the double doors she glances back

Something small and skeletal is coming scuttling over the
floor in and out of the light

Its a bony HAND The jar of nails EXPLODES The pile of
bricks tumbles over

Edith slams the doors and throws the lock She backs away
but like a spider the fingers wriggle out from under the
door

ELEVATOR DOWN

Edith charges into the lift and yanks the lever - and
nothing happens

EDITH
Down dammit Down

Finally the cab jerks sways and starts moving -

( )

- but the hand - covered in rotten flesh - is pressed
against the outside of the glass riding along

The dog thrashes in her arms strangling in her grip

The ground floor is in sight But the cab drops right past
it

EDITH (CONT’D)
No

Desperate Edith pulls on the control handle - to no avail

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

A filthy BASEMENT comes into view shelving canned goods
an ancient washer and mangle

And the elevator keeps going

INT LEVELS - CONTINUOUS

-passing dark abandoned tunnels once active with iron
miners

INT MINE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Finally a gentle BUMP as the elevator stops The HAND drops
off the glass and withdraws

Edith puts down the dog and tries the lever but the
elevator wont budge
INT MINE LANDING

Ediths groping fingers encounter a light switch She twists
the knob and a few brownish bulbs come on

Inky tunnels are everywhere like an enlarged termite nest
No movement no sound except for the distant DRIP of water

Edith starts down steep rickety steps which creak in
protest
INT MINE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

The dog trots ahead On the rough-hewn walls hang mining
tools chains and lanterns

( )

Edith moves carefully keeping an eye out for the terrible
hand - or anything else
ALCOVE

In an alcove she discovers a pile of womens shoes The dog
sniffs at them unleashing a stampede of COCKROACHES

Edith lifts the lid of a STEAMER TRUNK and finds

a STRAW HAT A WHITE CANE A womans SPECTACLES with
BLACK LENSES And an adorable flock of Finlays HAND-CARVED
SHEEP She examines a lace HANDKERCHIEF with an embroidered
monogram ES She smells it - recognizing the perfume
Below it she finds three ALBUMS of Kodak snapshots

The handwritten labels on each album

Pamela Upton - London - 1887

Margaret McDermott - Edinburgh - 1893

Eleanora Schott - Leipzig - 1896

She remembers that day at her fathers office-

FLASHBACK ENDS
ALCOVE

Edith opens the albums

( )

They all feature Thomas and several beautiful well-dressed
YOUNG WOMEN They are young and healthy in carriages or in
formal wear

The youngest of them is blind and carries a white cane

The German woman is holding the cute little dog that has
befriended Edith

EDITH
Oh my God-

A thin malevolent WHISPER from the darkness

VOICE
Edith Verstorben Verstorben

Edith snatches up an IRON BAR and strides out into the empty
tunnel

EDITH
Who is it Show yourself

No answer Edith frowns FLIES are buzzing The dog starts
to trot forward into the dark

EDITH (CONT’D)
(to the dog)
No Stay -

The dog obeys Looks up at her

AT THE ELEVATOR

Brushing away hordes of flies Edith climbs the stairs and
throws open the doors of the elevator -

Waiting inside a decomposing YOUNG WOMAN with a DEAD BABY
caught in her long hair

The weeping thing holds out the infants remains

YOUNG WOMAN
Er ist gestorben - Wahrend Sie wird

Edith screams and lashes out with the iron bar The figure
swirls like oily smoke and reconfigures its eyes bulging
in supplication

Retreating Edith tumbles down the stairs She hits the
bottom landing hard - something SNAPS

( )

She screams her face contorted in pain Somewhere an
infant is wailing a mother is shrieking

Mercifully Edith loses consciousness

FADE OUT
FADE IN

EXT HOUSE - DUSK

The windows glow in the swirling snow Sharpes motorcar is

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

A stolid bearded young man gazes down on Edith Its Dr
Alan McMichael Seeing that her eyes are open

DR MCMICHAEL
Hello Edith Dont try to move just yet

Edith looks around and recognizes the master bedroom A fire
crackles in the grate

EDITH
Alan - Wh- what are you doing here Is
it-

DR MCMICHAEL
Easy easy Youre going to be fine We
need just a bit longer for the plaster to
dry
(another smile)
Quite a shock seeing me I warrant
Forgive me

Sharpe and Lucille are watching anxiously from the doorway

SHARPE
Edith we met Dr McMichael in
Blencathra on his way to us Heaven-
sent as it turns out

DR MCMICHAEL
I arrived in Southampton three days ago
I should have sent a wire
(smiles at them all)
But I thought youd enjoy the surprise

( )

LUCILLE
Wed have been at a loss Edith
Helpless especially in this weather
Its a miracle you were bleeding - a
compound fracture -

Dr McMichael is wiping his hands which are covered in
white plaster Ediths left leg is encased in a hip-to-ankle
cast

Groggy Edith looks at them then blurts out

EDITH
The dog ran away I couldnt find it-

DR MCMICHAEL
Shh- not now-

EDITH
She spoke to me -

LUCILLE
Who spoke to you

EDITH
She knew my name -

DR MCMICHAEL
Its shock Shell be quite woolly-headed-
(he stops looks at Edith)
What is it Edith Are you in pain

Tears are rolling down Ediths cheeks Her lips are
trembling as she remembers Dr McMichael brings a cup of
hot TEA to her mouth

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)
Here Drink

As she drinks he places a small BROWN BOTTLE on the night
stand

DR MCMICHAEL (CONTD)
Its an opium derivative no more than
two drops with hot liquids Once a day
(to Sharpe and Lucille)
No more than two drops understood

EDITH
(lying back)
She looked at me - the ghost - and in her
arms-— oh God she was holding something
awful A dead b-

Thomas freezes but Lucille cuts in -

LUCILLE
Edith You were mad to go down there
The mine is ill-lit and crawling with
vermin and you used my keys And the
lift
(to Sharpe)
You see It should be disabled or locked-

SHARPE
But I told her - you remember I warned
you didnt I Edith

LUCILLE
Clearly she didnt understand or didnt
care-

DR MCMICHAEL
Excuse me
(the others fall silent)
May I ask would you take your
conversation downstairs I think shes
heard enough for now

SHARPE
I beg your pardon

DR MCMICHAEL
Let me finish here We must all do our
best to see that she gets some rest

Lucille pulls Sharpe by the sleeve

LUCILLE
Well leave you then Dr McMichael
With your patient

They leave Edith brushes away her tears and tries to sit
up

EDITH
(falling back)
Im dizzy - everythings upside down

DR MCMICHAEL
Its the narcotic You may feel some
nausea Have you ever broken a limb
before

Edith shakes her head

( )

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)
It was a habit of mine as a boy My
aviation experiments I fell off the roof
twice I spent my youth in plaster casts

(pause)
Now whats all this about a ghost

Edith smiles weakly

EDITH
They dont exist I know Until one day
they do Given enough time in this house
Alan I swear even you-

He stops her with a gentle smile

DR MCMICHAEL
No no A methodical drudge - a pill
pusher - is just not cut out for such
things

She takes his hand

EDITH
I cant believe youre actually here Is
everything all right

DR MCMICHAEL
I hope so yes Im making certain
inquiries Well discuss them tomorrow
when youre ready

EDITH
What are you talking about Tell me now
I cant just lie here -

DR MCMICHAEL
(after a moment)
I went to your fathers club Early At
that hour there are no other swimmers
The floor is perfectly dry How could he
slip And his injuries yes injuries
I saw multiple fractures

Edith is looking at him in horror

EDITH
Oh God Alan

DR MCMICHAEL

Lie back You must get some rest
Im here to confirm a few facts -

( )

EDITH
What sort of facts
(no answer)
I love him hes more than I ever wished
for hes my life now-

DR MCMICHAEL
I know I wanted to be happy for you
Even as I worried Ive thought of little
else

He puts a pillow under her head and touches her cheek

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)

and well go over everything

INT FOYER - NIGHT

Lucille and Sharpe are waiting as the Doctor comes

As they walk to the door

SHARPE

especially ferocious passage

INT ALCOVE - NIGHT

Far underground Sharpe enters the darkened alcove Hearing
a WHISPER he holds his lantern high

An ambiguous SHADOW undulates over the wall then onto the
ceiling - Startled Sharpe presses himself into a corner
but after a moment he frowns seeing that one of the trunks
is open As are the photo albums within

He flicks through snapshots of himself embracing the
beautiful GERMAN WOMAN with a pudgy BABY in her arms More
PHOTOS the two kissing on a forest path pushing a baby
carriage through the main plaza in Leipzig

Sharpe drags the steamer trunk down a tunnel to the edge of
an open pit He kicks away a GUARD RAIL then tips the trunk

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

Edith opens her eyes as Sharpe enters pushing the wicker
WHEELCHAIR Lucille follows carrying a BREAKFAST TRAY

( )

SHARPE
Good morning my love Look what we
found It was grandfathers

He sits down in the wheelchair and rolls himself over to
her Lucille parks the tray on a bedside table

SHARPE (CONTD)
I used to play with it He must have been
over six foot tall - far too big for you

LUCILLE
So Did you sleep well

EDITH
I never moved

LUCILLE
Good Now try to eat something Dr
McMichaels orders

She pours a cup of tea and adds FOUR DROPS from the brown
bottle Sharpe counts them with her TOO MANY Their eyes
meet -

LUCILLE (CONT’D)
Ive made porridge as usual And a fresh
pot of tea Here

Lucille places the tray in front of Edith who begins to eat
the cereal

EDITH
Tell me Were there other children living
here Within the last few years

SHARPE
No there were no-

LUCILLE
(swiftly)
Yes Yes one of the housekeepers had a
baby It died They both died actually
After leaving the country more than ten
years ago -

EDITH
Was her name Eleanora Schott

LUCILLE
Precisely She was a German woman highly
educated Of course you remember her
Thomas How Finlay adored her

( )

Their eyes are riveted on the cup of tea They watch as

Edith brings

it to her lips - pretending to drink

SHARPE
I do remember yes

EDITH
Her things are here in the house I saw a
book - but the date was 1897 just
three years ago

SHARPE
She left everything when she returned to
Leipzig But you must have misread the
date

Edith replaces the cup on the saucer the tea is untouched
Having another spoonful of porridge

Again Edith
brother

EDITH
And Pamela Upton Margaret McDermott Who
are they

LUCILLE
My piano students For a moment I thought
I might be cut out for teaching It was a
disaster Im sorry to say

SHARPE
This house is full of memories So many
of them unhappy We shouldnt talk
about them

pretends to sip some tea Lucille glares at her

LUCILLE
(to Sharpe)
Then lets get out of this room and let
your darling invalid enjoy her breakfast
in peace Come

As she propels her brother toward the door Edith pours the
cup of tea into a flower vase next to the bed

Not a moment

too soon - Sharpe stops and lingers in the

doorway As he turns back

EDITH
Thomas I - I feel such a fool Snooping
in the basement dredging up sorry
things I will not ruin everything I
promise

( )

SHARPE
No its not you This place never
recovered When father died - in the
library - he - died alone and distraught
He killed himself Edith And this house
died with him

EDITH
My God- Im so sorry What happened

Sharpe returns to her and sits on the edge of the bed

SHARPE
After mothers death He went to pieces

Edith reaches for him He embraces her visibly moved

Edith shakes

SHARPE (CONTD)
Edith Was it a mistake Bringing you
here - to this cold and lonely place

her head He kisses her gently

SHARPE (CONTD)
It was If youre seeing ghosts its
because of me Im sorry

EDITH
(studying his face)
No no Once I would have given anything
to live among spirits To commune with
them to be brave and not run away

SHARPE
And now

EDITH
Now I have you Send them on their
way Thomas if you can It is I who
belong here not them

SHARPE
You you are different So different

EDITH
Different from whom

SHARPE
Everyone

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Sharpe places the breakfast things next to the sink Lucille
checks the teapot

SHARPE
She drank it - look

He holds up the empty cup

LUCILLE
Maybe she did maybe not It doesnt
matter I put half the opium in the
porridge

CUT TO

INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE - DAY

A MANAGING EDITOR leads Dr McMichael through a busy
newspaper office A noisy printing press is at work

MANAGING EDITOR
We dont make our back issues available
to just anybody But seeing as youre a
medical man

The rear of the office is jammed with wooden filing
cabinets Several EMPLOYEES are leafing through bound back
issues

MANAGING EDITOR (CONT’D)
Anything ever written about that family
would be in here Weve found a few
things

Dr McMichael examines a photo that has been set aside a
very young but recognizable THOMAS sitting on a pony
Standing alongside holding the reins is a blonde
ADOLESCENT GIRL

DR MCMICHAEL
(reading the caption)
Lucille Sharpe introduces brave little
brother Thomas to the joys of the horse
ring

MANAGING EDITOR
Doctor if you dont mind at night I
have the strangest numbness in my lower
back -

( )

DR MCMICHAEL
At night you say Tell me all about it

MANAGING EDITOR
Its a tingling sensation right down to
my toes

Something else catches Dr McMichaels attention Its a
newspaper column entitled RECENT WEDDINGS

DR MCMICHAEL
One moment please

In the text a PHOTO of twenty-something Thomas marrying
Pamela Upton a fair-haired young society girl from London
who wears dark glasses and carries a long white cane

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)
The Baronet Sir Thomas - hes had how
Many wives

MANAGING EDITOR
Havent the foggiest Ive never met the
man

On another page another photo more recent of Thomas
marrying Eleanora Schott a wealthy heiress from Germany

MANAGING EDITOR (CONTD)
But I daresay you should go back August
1872 Thats the real shocker

The man leafs through another bound volume this one older

MANAGING EDITOR (CONTD)
Ive never heard anyone speak about it
As if everyone in the district were
ashamed or paid to keep mum I suppose
the Sharpes were powerful enough back
then but even so - it made the front

page

DR MCMICHAEL
Dear God

MANAGING EDITOR
Dreadful business isnt it No
photographs then - but here -
(he turns to another page)
the engravings are clear enough

( )

Dr McMichael is speechless as looks at an unseen page of
illustrations

DISSOLVE TO

INT MINE TUNNELS
The elevator descends and stops Edith is on board

She glides ghost-like down inky tunnels deep underground
Her eyes are closed her hair billows as if underwater

Gaping HOLES and CRACKS pass below her bare feet - but she
floats over them her nightgown swirling

Magically Edith is in a

PENTAGONAL ROOM

where flies are buzzing Four of the five walls feature
newly-laid bricked-in CRYPTS

The fifth crypt is still open waiting for her Suddenly
Lucille Sharpe steps out from the darkness Although her
mouth never moves her low VOICE is audible
LUCILLE (VO)

None of you will ever leave Youll dwell

here in torment at my pleasure
Ediths eyes fly open as a shining blade pierces her neck
A strangled wet SHRIEK erupts from her lips -
INT BEDROOM - DAY

Edith wakes up Weak sunlight filters in from behind the
heavy drapes which have been drawn tight

CUT TO

INT BATHROOM - DAY
Edith is bent over the toilet vomiting

She straightens up and tries to clear her head pausing at
the sink to take a few swallows of water

She stops as she catches sight of her reflection in the
mirror

( )

Shock her face is gaunt her eyes sunken She brings a claw-

like hand to her throat which is stained black Her tongue
is black too -

EDITH
No - no

She brushes against a naked WRAITH - the walking corpse of a
young woman whose face is half-hidden behind a curtain of
black hair The awful thing reaches for Edith but -
- both her arms are chopped off at the elbow
WRAITH

Soon I say Ssssoon -
INT BEDROOM - DAY
Again Edith wakes up This time for real She looks around
alone in her room Trembling she flings off the bed covers

and gets to her feet

Shes clumsy teetering on her plaster cast dizzy from the
ingested drug

EDITH
Thomas
INT CORRIDOR - DAY

A muttering hideous SHAPE is rolling through the shadows of
the upstairs corridor

Its Edith in the wheelchair Weak and disoriented she
stops her head lolls a MOAN breaks the silence

Another MOAN Down the hall sitting outside Lucilles
room is the dog

IN LUCILLES ROOM

Edith reaches the threshold and pushes the door aside She
stands in front of a mirror A man behind her kisses the
nape of her neck and embraces her suggestively She MOANS
but

-sees Edith

The man turns around- Is Thomas

CORRIDOR

Gasping Edith blindly rolls herself toward the stairs

The dog runs ahead barking like a mad thing Suddenly the
wheelchair jerks to a stop Sharpe is there holding her in

place

She flails at him he fends her off his face a picture of
calm

Then Lucille looms up stirring a glass of water and
bringing it to Ediths lips

Edith hurls herself out of the wheelchair She hits the
floor with a thump only to be rolled onto her back

Sharpe puts a knee on her chest and pins her arms He
glances at Lucille and nods

Lucille again comes close with the drinking glass She SLAPS
Edith hard then swiftly grabs her nose and forces the
solution down her throat

Gagging Edith spits the liquid at the womans face

EDITH
Who are you Who are you really

LUCILLE
Who do you think

EDITH
Youre not his sister

Lucille slaps her again and forces more liquid down

LUCILLE
I am

Edith struggles reaching for the chair She tries to crawl
but Sharpe kneels next to her holding her down

FADE OUT

BLACK SCREEN

Silence Then the boom of the DOOR KNOCKER

FADE IN

EXT THE SHARPE MANSION - DAY
The snow has stopped Drifts are everywhere

Lucille opens up to find Dr McMichael on the doorstep
carrying his black bag and a large book - one of the bound
volumes from the local paper

His horse and sleigh are in the driveway

DR MCMICHAEL
Good afternoon Miss Sharpe Hows Edith

LUCILLE
Shes asleep right now Doctor

DR MCMICHAEL
Thats fine Fine And your brother

LUCILLE
Hes gone to the post office Hell be

DR MCMICHAEL

LUCILLE
Dr McMichael last night didnt go

crying out We were all of us up til
dawn

DR MCMICHAEL
If shes in pain I should see her-

LUCILLE
No no Shes finally getting her rest I
wonder do you have more opium In the
dark we broke the bottle

DR MCMICHAEL
Of course

(pats his bag)
Right in here

LUCILLE
But come inside Theres no reason for
you to freeze to death

INT DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Still in his overcoat Dr McMichael is seated on the sofa
decanting some liquid opium into another small bottle

Lucille tends to the fire and sits opposite him eyeing the
drug

DR MCMICHAEL
Well Back home everyones clamoring for
some news Tell me Miss Sharpe hows
her book been going

LUCILLE
Oh she talks of nothing else Quite the
imagination that one

DR MCMICHAEL
A writers talent is one Ive always
envied

LUCILLE
You have a taste for fiction Doctor

DR MCMICHAEL
I do Although in my experience actual
events can go far beyond ones wildest
imaginings

INT BEDROOM - SAME

The bedroom is dark Lying under the covers barely moving
Edith hears the distant voices as if in a dream

EDITH
(raising herself up)
Alan -
Across the room the dog is alert tail thumping
Edith looks at the open door then reaches for the rubber
ball on the night stand With supreme effort she rolls it
into the hallway

It almost reaches the stairs when the dog scampers and -
brings it back

EDITH (CONTD)
No - no

Fighting off nausea she again picks up the ball Throws
it

( )

The dog instantly goes after it But in the hall the
animal recoils as one of the hissing spectres - Pamela
Upton the blind girl - springs forth from the shadows

A dry bony hand guides the rolling ball to the steps

INT LIBRARY - SAME

Dr McMichael is about to give Lucille the bottle of opium
but almost teasing he pulls it away

DR MCMICHAEL
You know Miss Sharpe I really should
examine the patient before doling this
out

LUCILLE

(thin smile)
And her doctors orders what of them As
I recall he was quite insistent on rest
and sedation

A moment of silence as they size each other up

Suddenly the RUBBER BALL bounces down the stairs and into
the room The dog follows barking happily

DR MCMICHAEL
Ah Someones awake

He pockets the opium vial and exits

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Dr McMichael strides into the bedroom and draws back the
curtain revealing Crimson Peak He sits at Ediths bedside

DR MCMICHAEL
There Now - if youll just look at me

Edith gazes into Dr McMichaels eyes he checks her pupils
then takes her pulse

EDITH
Help- help me- take me away

Dr McMichael picks up the brown bottle checks the liquid

DR MCMICHAEL
Yes But not now Youre in no shape-

( )

EDITH
Now You must - You dont understand- I
can walk

DR MCMICHAEL
You cant

EDITH
The wheelchair then-

Lucille appears in the doorway Dr McMichael changes his
demeanor

DR MCMICHAEL

(to Lucille)
Shes showing signs of anemia and
exhaustion Im going to take her to a
hospital -

LUCILLE
That wont be necessary

DR MCMICHAEL
Miss Sharpe under the circumstances -

LUCILLE
Doctor we appreciate everything you
coming here so fortuitously doing what
you can But we have decided to seek the
assistance of a bone specialist

DR MCMICHAEL
You didnt mention anything before -

LUCILLE
I didnt want to trouble you - or appear
unkind An osteopath is coming from
London Tonight

DR MCMICHAEL
Is he now

LUCILLE
In fact my brother has gone to fetch him
at the station

DR MCMICHAEL
Then you wont mind if I stay and make
his acquaintance

A NOISE from outside signals the arrival of a motorcar
Lucille hurries away

( )

Dr McMichael immediately takes Edith by the arm

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)
All right Show me you can stand up

INT FOYER - DAY

Lucille opens the front door Sharpe is already out of his
car alarmed at the sight of Dr McMichaels sleigh

SHARPE
(seeing Lucille)
How long has he been here

LUCILLE
Half an hour He wont leave

SHARPE
Ill deal with him

Sharpe hands a large postal ENVELOPE to Lucille as he heads
for the grand staircase

SHARPE (CONTD)
Here From her solicitor And the Boston
bank

Lucille pulls a thick wad of papers and contracts out from
the envelope

INT BEDROOM - SAME

Sharpe enters the bedroom and finds Edith seated in the
wheelchair Dr McMichael stands behind her

DR MCMICHAEL
Good afternoon Sir Thomas We were just
going

SHARPE
Leave her be

Lucille comes alongside her brother Shes holding something
in the folds of her skirt

DR MCMICHAEL
Do you know the Brathwaite Daily Ledger
The newspaper of record for northern
Cumberland Ive borrowed some back
issues

( )

He kneels next to the wheelchair so Edith can see He opens
the book of old newspapers

DR MCMICHAEL (CONTD)

(to Edith)
Edith It seems that your mother-in-law
Lady Edwina Sharpe was murdered here in
this house

Edith stares at him in puzzlement Then she looks at the
open book

Headline AXE MURDER AT SHARPETON CAMERA lingers on a
detailed STEEL ENGRAVING depicting a butchered woman in the
library downstairs

DR MCMICHAEL (CONT’D)
No suspect was ever arrested

SHARPE
Did you understand what I said Leave

DR MCMICHAEL
(turning)

You Sir Thomas were only thirteen at
the time After questioning by the
police you were sent off to boarding
school in Surrey

(to Lucille)
Your story Lucille is less clear A
convent education in Switzerland it
said

LUCILLE
(to Sharpe)
What are you waiting for

DR MCMICHAEL
An entire paragraph describes the
condition of the body as it was found A
grisly thing a hatchet or something
similar Thirty blows -

LUCILLE
Enough-

BAMM She darts forward and stabs Dr McMichael in the
NECK with a boning knife

Edith screams

The Doctor arches back the knife jutting from under his
ear He staggers out the door struggling to remove it

( )

Edith is on her feet reeling trying to catch up SOCK
Lucille smacks her back into the wheelchair

EXT THE SHARPE MANSION - DAY

Bleeding profusely the Doctor gropes his way down the ice-
covered front stairway He finally pulls out the knife then
slips and falls

The knife bounces off the stone steps

Rolling over he sees Lucille coming- calmly picking up the
knife Then Sharpe is there followed by the excited DOG

The Doctor scrambles backwards clutching his wound He
points at Lucille

DR MCMICHAEL
Who is she Sharpe Where did you find
her -

Lucille hands the knife to Sharpe
LUCILLE
(to Sharpe)
You do this Get your hands dirty for a
change

DR MCMICHAEL
Edith will not die here Not her

Numb Sharpe stares at the knife in his hand
LUCILLE
(to Sharpe)
Ill deal with him you said - Youve
never done anything for us - look at you

DR MCMICHAEL
Shes stronger than both of you

Lucille pushes Sharpe forward

LUCILLE
Do it

Sharpe closes in on the wounded man and stabs him in the
gut

SHARPE
Im sorry Im sorry

( )

He twists the KNIFE digging deeper

The Doctor twitches groans and goes still The dog tail
wagging licks at the fresh blood on the snow Repulsed
Sharpe turns away

INT THE SHARPE MANSION - DAY

Lucille and Thomas drag Dr McMichael into the elevator
Lucille goes through the mans pockets and retrieves the
opium

Then she steps out and Thomas takes the elevator down under
the house Once hes gone Lucille brings out the knife and
turns toward the dog

LUCILLE

(sweetly)
Come here doggie Come along see what I
have

INT CRYPT - DAY

CAMERA follows a BLOODY SMEAR along the floor of the mine
tunnel to the brick crypt where Sharpe is stuffing Dr
McMichael into a dark corner

He tosses the Doctors black bag and the bound book of
newspapers onto the body and leaves

For several seconds all is still Then very slowly the
Doctors eyes open He coughs and a surge of blood rolls
over his chin

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Lucille appears at the bedroom door in her bloody hands a
COIL OF ROPE She tosses the rubber ball at the back of the
wheelchair

LUCILLE
There I just put a poor creature out of
its misery It was missing its mistress
a certain German woman

She jerks the wheelchair around empty She checks the
bathroom - Edith is gone

Lucille throws open one of the windows and looks out front
No horse and sleigh

( )

LUCILLE (CONT’D)
Thomas

CUT TO

EXT VILLAGE STREET - DAY

A WHIP cracks the horse-drawn sleigh yaws into view
skidding down the abandoned main street of Sharpeton

Edith hauls on the reins stopping at Finlays hovel

EDITH
Mr Finlay

She gets down from the drivers bench barely able to stand
Gripping a tumble-down fence for support -

EDITH (CONTD)
Mr Finlay -

Finlays sheepdog appears in the doorway

INT HUT - CONTINUOUS

Edith hobbles inside and looks around The huts a mess a
meagre coal fire is smoking on the grate Her foot knocks a
whisky bottle across the floor

EDITH
Wake up Come on -

She shakes a lump in the bed its a pile of old clothes

Suddenly Finlay is standing in the doorway and cradling one
of the lambs

FINLAY
That sleigh out there it came up from
town

EDITH

Yes Thats right Take me to town Mr
Finlay Can you do that

FINLAY
Straightaway I can As you say my Lady -
jawohl und schnell

Edith is near to fainting Finlay grabs her before she
blacks out

( )

FINLAY (CONTD)
Wheres Sir Thomas then You need help

EXT HILLS - DAY

Ediths eyes open shes back on the sleigh with Finlay
driving now The horse trots along smoothly theyre
making good time

She glances behind - no ones following them

EDITH
Mr Finlay - Im not Eleanora Schott
Fraulein Eleanora do you understand
that Shes dead three years ago

FINLAY
(nodding)
I saved a lamb for the baby She was
named Mary after all

EDITH
You saw this baby They showed you

FINLAY

EDITH
(confused)

FINLAY
Home my Lady Whoa -
(he hauls on the reins)
Da kommen sie Youll be all right now
Sure enough - a CAR HORN from up ahead

Its Sharpe and Lucille in their motorcar Coming down from
the road to the house closing in on them

CUT TO

EXT THE SHARPE MANSION - DAY

The motorcar is parked in the driveway Finlay is gone

( )

Sharpe and Lucille drag Edith up the front steps at the
top she manages to tear free

EDITH
(to Lucille)
You - you - youre his wife arent you-

LUCILLE
Why do you say that Because of what you
saw Two monsters naked on the bed
Tell her Thomas Tell her -

Sharpe calmly walks toward her

SHARPE
Edith Im afraid she is my sister

Flailing at him Edith loses her balance and slides all the
way down the steps She winds up on her back her broken leg
splayed out

She SCREAMS with fresh pain

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Edith is tied to the bedposts Like an animal she tugs
repeatedly at the ropes finally freeing one arm Her wrist
is rubbed raw

She lifts the sheet and looks at her broken leg a RED STAIN
is seeping into the white plaster cast As she begins to
untie her other arm Lucille enters and reacts

LUCILLE
Still the clever one I see Thats fine
Here take this

She hands Edith a gold-nibbed FOUNTAIN PEN and plops a heap
of PAPERS before her

Edith recognizes the documents from Boston that will
transfer her fortune to the local bank

LUCILLE (CONTD)
No need to read them Just sign

Seeing Ediths hesitation -

LUCILLE (CONTD)

What are you waiting for You have
nothing to live for He never loved you
Any of you He loves only me

( )

EDITH
Thats not true

LUCILLE
Its indisputably true my dear The
women we found - in London Edinburgh
Leipzig -

EDITH
- Boston

LUCILLE
Yes Boston - all had what was necessary
money foolish dreams and no living
relatives Mercy killings - all of them
Very well there was love - one-sided
always - we specialized in provoking it

EDITH
And your mother You killed your own
mother

LUCILLE

(mild)

She caught us one day We were a bit
young I suppose but it had started and
we couldnt stop I did kill her To put
an end to her screaming

Lucille collects Ediths unfinished MANUSCRIPT from the foot
of the bed

LUCILLE (CONTD)
I was sent away To an institution -

She moves to the fireplace and starts throwing the pages
into the fire The burning papers fly up the chimney

LUCILLE (CONTD)
I was only seventeen years old The world
is inhabited by monsters uncomprehending
and unworthy of pity

Ediths not listening shes looking at the FOUNTAIN PEN
which she holds in her free hand

LUCILLE (CONTD)

(losing patience)
Sign your name - Sign your name Will
you sign your bloody name

Lucille kneels down on hard on Ediths broken leg

( )

LUCILLE (CONT’D)
No one hurts me No one -

Edith writhes holding back a scream
EDITH
Stop Stop I - I cant bear it Very

well Im ready

LUCILLE

Edith starts signing the papers
LUCILLE (CONTD)
(inspecting the signatures)

Good Its almost over now

CUT TO

INT CRYPTS - DAY

Dr McMichael is sprawled on the floor surrounded by the
contents of his medical bag His neck is bound up in bloody
cotton with clumsy fingers he tears strips from his shirt
and wraps them around his middle

Hearing something he pauses A low MOAN rises up from
somewhere - and the house breathes its mournful sigh

Caught in a sourceless breeze Doctor looks wildly around
terrified at what might come next

INT KITCHEN - DAY

As Sharpe fills the tea kettle a SHADOW slides across the
wall Startled Sharpe knocks over the coal scuttle -
spilling BLOOD across the floor He leaps away -

- but the blood vanishes Just scattered lumps of coal

INT BEDROOM - DAY
Edith is signing her name on page after page
LUCILLE
There Now I want you stay on that bed -

it will be just like falling asleep
Theres no pain far from it

( )

Edith gazes at the fountain pen clenched in her fist Her
hand is steady

EDITH
What about my father

LUCILLE
Ah of course - you have a right to know

Lucille cant hold back a small smile of triumph
LUCILLE (CONTD)
Such a coarse condescending man You
should have seen his face when I hit him

STAB Edith plunges the pen into Lucilles chest

Lucille lurches then - WHAM - cuffs Edith hard She tears
open her dress

Blood pours down her breast and ribs
She sees a frantic Edith untying her other hand trying to

get to the wheelchair Snarling Lucille kicks it away then
exits slamming and locking the door

INT KITCHEN - DAY

In the kitchen a POT OF TEA is steaming As Sharpe dumps in
the entire bottle of opium his skin begins to crawl

He slowly lifts his eyes The armless DEAD WOMAN is outside
only inches from the window frame

Crying out he grabs a chair and hurls it shattering the
glass

Lucille bursts in holding a piece of cloth to her wound

SHARPE
What happened What did she-

LUCILLE
(pushing him aside)
I- Im perfectly well Its you Im
worried about

She inspects the broken window glass leans outside to have
a quick look around

LUCILLE (CONT’D)
Shell take that tea from you not me

( )

SHARPE
I saw her - I saw Margaret - Margaret
McDermott-
(pointing)
- just there
LUCILLE

Youll say anything now just to keep
from going up there and doing what must
be done

She slams the signed documents on the kitchen table A drop
of her blood hits the top page near Ediths signature

LUCILLE (CONTD)
There Its done

SHARPE
What we are - what we have become We
must stop

LUCILLE
Why Why now

SHARPE
Because because shes innocent

LUCILLE
They were all innocent

Ominous silence
LUCILLE (CONTD)

Have you fallen in love baby brother
Is that it Have you

SHARPE
No - I dont love her
LUCILLE
What
SHARPE
I dont love her
LUCILLE
Again-
SHARPE

I dont love her Lucille

LUCILLE

( )

SHARPE

I love - only you I love-
LUCILLE

Only me
SHARPE

Only you Lucille

She kisses him and then hands him the tea

LUCILLE
Then kill her

INT BEDROOM - DAY

Edith has dragged herself to the window Grabbing the

curtain she hauls herself upright Then she pulls up on the

sash with all her might

It moves an inch Edith pauses staring out at -

- Crimson Peak Redder than ever

She tries again The window moves some more

CLACK- The doorknob turns Sharpe enters bearing a
with the teapot cup and saucer

Edith turns to face him

EDITH
Youll tell me now was it the money
Only that

Sharpe busies himself with pouring the tea

SHARPE
All of those women were alone They had
no one no prospects One was blind They
were sad really ignorant without
talent Killing them was almost an act
of mercy-

He passes her the teacup

EDITH
And the child Your child

SHARPE
The child was unwell Its death was like
that of the others An act of mercy

( )

tray

EDITH
No Not mercy Greed You killed for
money One after the other you met and
married them and then my turn came
Is that it Thomas

No answer She throws the poisoned tea in his face
EDITH (CONT’D)
Why Why must we all die For your land

your property - For your name

He turns away wiping at his eyes -

SHARPE

No - theres no time I - I cant-
EDITH

Tell me For her

Again Sharpe cant answer

EDITH (CONT’D)
You were only a boy how old - Were
you so alone

SHARPE
Night is never lonelier never darker
than when youre a child-

EDITH
Why her-

SHARPE
There is no answer Thats the madness of
it - the power of it Even now Lucille
is me- and I am her That dark thing -
she lives inside me All our lives we
felt it - something stronger than love or
hate She is my fate - she made me and
she will destroy me

EDITH
But not me

She puts on her glasses and takes a few faltering steps He
catches hold of her arm but she tears free

EDITH (CONT’D)
I can walk -

She throws a coat over her shoulders

( )

EDITH (CONT’D)

For all your words the truth is plain
enough Youre free of her and shes
helpless without you

(pause)
Now Youre going to help me Down those
stairs out the front door - then into
town

They look at each other for a long moment Edith has no idea
what hell do Finally

SHARPE
We only need to reach the motorcar Stay
close to me no matter what

He cracks open the bedroom door Looks around all quiet
As they start forward-

SHARPE (CONTD)

Wait You signed the papers -
EDITH
Theres no time-
SHARPE
No I know her You must get them back-

Stay here

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Sharpe walks into the deserted kitchen The bank papers are
still on the table

But Lucille steps out from behind a cupboard holding the
boning knife Her face is contorted with grief

LUCILLE
I thought so I could see it in your
eyes

SHARPE
She will live

LUCILLE

What have you told her - What did you
promise her A country bungalow A
rose garden Sweet children

SHARPE
Youre not to touch her or even get near
her

(MORE )

( )

SHARPE (CONTD)
(Lucille eyes him)
Is that clear Answer me

LUCILLE
And me What happens to me in your happy
dreams What happens to this house To
Crimson Peak and the mine Or the bodies
down there Our blood- my fingers my
lips and flesh Will you forget all
that

She lowers the knife blinking back tears Sharpe picks up
the papers and reaches out for the knife

SHARPE
We knew this day had to come And now
its happened Its over Lucy She will
live

But then with a MOAN the house breathes again and
Lucille -

- stabs Sharpe in the chest He tries to grab the knife from
her but she slashes at his hands and arms

As they struggle-

INT UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY
Edith leans out into the corridor

She hobbles to the railing and looks down past the grand
staircase into the foyer below

The distant CRASH of glassware A GROAN

AT THE ELEVATOR
Edith goes to the elevator and stares at the call button

She reaches for it but - CLUNK - The motor starts
the cab comes up

Edith can see a figure through the elevators glass panels
EDITH
(backing away)

Thomas -

The lift stops the doors open and Sharpe is there

( )

His shirt is soaked in blood More blood is pooling at his
feet She grabs him before he collapses

EDITH (CONTD)
Thomas-—

He hands her the bank papers

SHARPE
Lets go- now- Edith-

A NOISE from below Lucille is marching up the stairs
holding the knife

Edith squeezes into the elevator next to Sharpe She quietly
closes the door and puts her hands on the bloodied control
handle

Then she waits and waits

until Lucille reaches the upstairs landing Their eyes
meet -and Edith jerks the handle to the down position

A long maddening PAUSE - and with a lurch the elevator
goes down

SCREAMING Lucille rushes forward Too late

INT FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Fearing the worst Edith watches the ground floor getting

closer and closer She reaches past Sharpe and centers the
control lever

The lift comes to a perfect stop She turns to Sharpe but
hes slumped over now When she pushes open the doors he

tumbles out onto his back dead

Edith limps through the gloomy foyer to the -

FRONT DOOR
- which is LOCKED

LUCILLE (0S)
Where do you think youre going

LUCILLE

In no hurry the knife at her side Lucille stops and looks
at the iron rack near the hearth Among the fireplace tools
the SHOVEL is missing

LUCILLE
(calling out)

Edith - You wish to hurt me is that it

Very well -
Very carefully she enters the foyer

LUCILLE (CONTD)

- but I warn you in this sort of

business Im far more-
THUNK - the shovel swings out from the darkness and
smacks Lucille in the face slamming her against the front
door
ELEVATOR
Hobbling Edith makes it back to the elevator Lucille is
right behind her Edith gets in and jams the lever to

down

Descending she catches a glimpse of Lucilles flayed-open
face contorted in hatred

INT STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

Lucille runs downstairs as fast as she can trying to keep
up with the elevator

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The lift stops one floor below Edith sees Lucille coming
She pushes the lever again DOWN

BAMMM The elevator doors shudder as Lucille pounds them

Edith watches in horror as the woman cracks open the doors
and pins Ediths face against the mirrored back wall

The flailing knife cuts Ediths blouse and arms but in a
second shes descending again Theres just enough time for
Lucille to snatch off Ediths GLASSES

Slashed trapped Edith goes down down

INT CELLAR - CONTINUOUS

Lucille crushes the eyeglasses under her shoe Then she
hurries on

INT MINE LANDING

As if possessed the elevator STOPS at the first mine level
Edith furiously works the DOWN lever just as Lucille again

reaches the doors and tries to pry them open

This time Edith jabs with the shovel to break the grip of
the clawing hands

Suddenly the elevator drops like a stone

INT ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Edith SHRIEKS as the cab hurtles past dim rocky walls
and jerks to a hard stop four feet short of the bottom
SMASH Ediths head cracks one of the glass panels As blood
streams down her face she tries the control handle to no
effect

Acting quickly she forces open the doors drops the shovel
and squeezes out the small opening

INT MINE TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

Edith gropes her way down the stairs and turns on the
ceiling lights

Behind her the empty cab goes back up

INT PENTAGONAL ROOM

Once again Edith enters the pentagonal room Looks at the
crypts her eyes beseeching

EDITH
(whisper)
Help me I understand now I know who you
are
Her voice echoes off the walls she hears only the distant

elevator cables humming

( )

Theres fresh BLOOD on one of the ledges And on the floor
an open medical bag But no other sign of Dr McMichael
ELEVATOR

Bleeding heavily Lucille steps from the arriving lift The
knife glints as she comes down the wooden steps

Up ahead a womans skirts disappear around a corner
LUCILLE
Theres nowhere to run Edith
MINE TUNNELS

Under the pulsating lights Lucille confidently stalks her
prey through a maze of passageways

LUCILLE
(weird smile)
Yes thats the way Do you see it yet
She rounds another corner her victim is closer now
LUCILLE (CONTD)
The end of our labors a bottomless place
where this family came to nothing
Suddenly the figure ahead stops short unable to proceed
LUCILLE (CONTD)
Good Youve found it

PIT

The rough-edged PIT yawns before them Lucille closes in on
her victim who stands at the brink with nowhere to go

LUCILLE
You killed him Edith And he loved you

Down comes the knife - only to slice into diaphanous
boneless flesh Smoke wafts from the wounds The figure
turns- a dead baby caught in its hair

Its the ghost of the German woman smiling from ear to ear
Lucille SCREAMS suddenly seeing the other dead women

arrayed before her their spectral bodies rigid their
mouths agape

( )

Lucille instinctively lashes out with the knife -

LUCILLE (CONTD)
Youre dead youre dead -

- slashing at nothing

Wheezing exhausted Lucille realizes that Edith stands
among them calm and unafraid

LUCILLE (CONT’D)
Let me pass

EDITH
Youve made them suffer enough
LUCILLE
They are nothing Nothing Let me pass I

say
Edith comes forward eye to eye with Lucille
EDITH
With you gone they will be free all of
them

Hissing Lucille raises the knife-

Suddenly Ediths father is there a plume of blood rising
from his head into the air like smoke

Then the shovel clangs against LUCILLEs head Wielded by-
-Edith

The blow sends Lucille stumbling backwards Her feet fly up
as she disappears over the edge of the pit

A final WAIL as shes swallowed up in the darkness

The flickering ghost of Carter Cushing turns toward his
daughter His sad smile is full of love

EDITH (CONT’D)
Father -

FATHERS GHOST
Leave live

Ediths face is suddenly lit by shimmering warm light

( )

EDITH
(half-blinded)
Wait - Father wait

But its too late hes gone Gradually the light fades and
the diaphanous women recede into the walls Edith looks
down shes holding the shovel

Edith realizes that Dr McMichael is leaned up against the
rock wall wrapped in bloody bandages his face is rigid in
shock at what he has witnessed As their eyes meet

She rushes to him and catches him before he collapses

DISSOLVE TO

INT MINE TUNNEL - LATER

Edith limps down a mine tunnel supporting the barely
conscious Doctor A gust of cold air brushes her cheek

The tunnel slopes upward toward a glow of daylight

EXT HILLSIDE - DAY
The Sharpe mansion is a half mile away

Old sheds and rusted mining equipment poke up from the snow
drifts In the middle of the debris a tumbled-down MINE
ENTRANCE

Edith comes out and approaches CAMERA Her face is smudged
bloodied but set in determination She clings to the
Doctor urging him on

EDITH (VO)
As I left the nightmare behind me I knew
that peace had come to the loving souls
who sought only to help me And damnation
would be the fate of the real monsters of
Crimson Peak

She raises her eyes to the mountain glowing red under
lowering skies

EDITH (VO)
It was here that I found myself empty yet
content with the universe It was here-
in the cold indifference of winter on
the edge of death that I decided to live
once and for all

( )

SNOW begins to fall in big wet flakes as they make their
way toward the road

and CAMERA PULLS away higher and higher

DISSOLVE TO WHITE
