A MAN and WOMAN (early sixties) lay asleep in bed They are
extremely still

The PHONE rings The Man and Woman do not stir After a few
rings the ANSWERING MACHINE takes it (Next to the answering
machine is a photo of a family the man and woman standing
happily with their two teenaged daughters)

INT KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Dani stands in the kitchen mid-phone conversation
FRAUGHT She paces when she’s not speaking

the nerve to say something

Dani has opened a cabinet to pull out a pill bottle
SALMON Revisions 4

DANI GIRLFRIEND (VO)

riddance Right

DANI

Dani begins hastily composing an EMAIL to her sister Terri

DANI GIRLFRIEND (VO)
But what if I need him too

Because it shouldnt ever be
a chore Would it be a chore
if he leaned on you

Dani breaks from writing to respond

DANI

INT PIZZA PARLOR - NEW YORK NY - NIGHT

A grubby pizza parlor Outside the window looms a purple NYU
sign

CHRISTIAN very handsome and fit sits at a booth Beside him
are his friends MARK (26 droll shaggy hair) JOSH (27 a
skinny sometimes snobbish academic) and PELLE a nice-
looking Swedish exchange student Pelle doodles on his napkin
(drawing the flowers on the table)

Mark is currently lecturing a despondent Christian who
begins with his face in his arms (on the table)

MARK
Dude you need to stop sitting on
the fence with this

CHRISTIAN
But what if I end up regretting it
and then I can’t get her back

MARK CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
You don’t want her back I might

MARK
So then you can bitch to us for that
day abou how much you regret it
and well remind you AGAIN that
youve been wanting out of this
stupid relationship for the last
year and then you can find some new
chick who actually likes sex and who
doesn’t drag you through a million
hoops a day

Christian is thinking about this Extremely conflicted Josh
takes a break from reading his dog-eared copy of Primitive
Mentality (by Lucien Lévy-Bruhl) to ask

JOSH
Do you think a masochistic part of
you might be playing out this drama
to distract rom the work you
actually need to be doing

CHRISTIAN
repared to be offended)
And what work do I actually need to
do Josh

JOSH
(quietly almost to

himself)
Your prospectus maybe Your PhD

Christian clearly doesn’t want to be told his priorities by
Josh Before he can snap back an attractive WAITRESS (early
20s) brings over the check

WAITRESS
Whenever you guys are ready
PELLE
(with Swedish accent)

Thank you

She SMILES -- at Christian
SALMON Revisions 6

WAITRESS
Thank you

She HOLDS the smile with Christian and walks bashfully off
Mark definitely caught that

MARK
Dude You could be getting that
girl pregnant right now

PELLE MARK (CONTD)

And don’t forget all the

Swedish women you can

impregnate in June Yeah dude - don’t forget all
the Swedish milkmaids

Christian’s PHONE rings He checks It’s DANI He deflates

MARK (CONT’D
Who is that

Christian doesn’t respond

MARK (CONT’D
That’s not her again Seriously

Christian lets the call go

MARK (CONT’D
That’s ridiculous dude She needs
a therapist

CHRISTIAN
She has one
MARK
So she should call him That’s

insane dude She’s using you

The phone starts ringing again Christian checks it “Dani
again”

MARK (CONTD)
Oh my God

Christian answers He rises from the booth to get some
privacy

CHRISTIAN
Hello

On the other end an extended agonized MOAN

CHRISTIAN (CONT’D)
Dani

DANI (VO)
(distantly)
-no no no no no no no

CHRISTIAN
Sweetheart What’s going on

But now there’s only heavy frightening CRYING onthe other
end It’s a deep horrible cry One of pure animal grief

SALMON Revisions 7

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
(now scared)
What’s happening baby Please talk
to me

The crying has curdled into a sustained WAIL OF ANGUISH
INT GARAGE - MINNESOTA - NIGHT 7
The house from the beginning (scene 2)

Two CARS are parked Their engines hum quietly A FIREFIGHTER
opens one car’s door and turns OFF the ignition

We now reveal that the end of a GARDENING HOSE has been
taped to one car’s EXHAUST PIPE A second hose has been
taped to the other car’s exhaust pipe Both hoses TRAIL out
of the garage and INTO the house

EXT STREET - BROOKLYN NY - NIGHT 11
Dreamy snowfall in Brooklyn

Christian bundled up in layers RUNS down the street He’s
approaching DANI’S BUILDING buteven as he rushes he’s not
oing as fast as he possibly could There’s an ambivalence in

is stride

He enters the front door of Dani’s building

INT DANI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT 12
Wide on the LIVING ROOM We’re centered on the COUCH where
Christian sits Dani has crumbled there her head shaking

violently against Christian’s lap as she WEEPS Behind them
a WINDOW showcases snowfall against the dark night

Dani’s sobs are possessed of a profound despair It’s so
intense that it looks painful - dangerous even

We are pushing in on this toward them Christian’s eyes are
wide with worry A worry that goes beyond Dani’s well-being
He stares into space imagining a future that he’s being
chained to He looks TRAPPED

SALMON Revisions 8

We continue pushing toward them until we have pushed PAST
them The window behind them FILLS our frame

Through the window - HEAVY SNOW raging in a black vacuum We
hold on this as our OPENING CREDITS ROLL accompanied by
intense groaning score

After the credits we SLAM CUT TO

DAYLIGHT We are still looking out the window but it’s now
late afternoon LATE SPRING

INT DANI’S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - 6 MONTHS LATER 13

plans

CHRISTIAN

Christian nods for a little too long then “smiles” and
leaves the room Dani rises Stands for a moment Heavy

casual “all is well” expression

whole trip I’m doing Germany and
England after this

DANT
(to Christian)
Thats similar to what you’re thinking
of doing - right For your thesis

CHRISTIAN
(tensely)
Well I don’t know quite what I’m

Josh doesn’t Stubborn

PELLE
Can you feel the energy come up
from the earth
(then noticing)

swelling and deflating with psychedelic life They LOOM
IMPOSINGLY over Dani They GROAN in the wind their branches
leaning (almost reaching) down

how to stay in harmony Everything
mechanically doing its part

MARK

You guys are my family
The word “family” HITS Dani
MARK (CONTD)
I really mean that You’re like my
real actual Family
Dani RISES to her knees suddenly overwhelmed Christian
looks to her She looks to him He SMILES but there’s
something false about it
Dani looks SCARED now This scares Christian

CHRISTIAN
Dani Don’t look like that

Dani STANDS panic mounting Her eyes look crazed

DANI
I’m sorry I’m gonna walk
CHRISTIAN DANI (CONTD)
I can walk too No no Sorry I’m gonna

Dani starts to walk off a terrible feeling rising in her

JOSH MARK
Is she mad at us I don’t like how she did
that

Dani continues to walk She’s starting to think very bad
thoughts

DANI
(to herself)
No that’s not good No No

She then stumbles onto a group of mirthful YOUTHS - all
wearing flower garlands They sit ina circle as a YQUNG

WOMAN (20s) plays guitar and sings Saand Lunka Vi Sand Smaningom

in a silly voice (to the laughter of the others) They a
suddenly see Dani the guitarist stops playing and
thenthey all BURST OUT LAUGHING

Dani turns stiffly away tears welling

DANI (CONT’D)
No no no no

Dani tensely speed-walks away looking down at the ground
Her surroundings are THROBBING visibly (and more intensely
than before)

INGEMAR calls out to Dani

INGEMAR
Hey Dani

SALMON Revisions 25

Dani freezes Terrified she looks up in his direction He
waves her over He’s standing with a few youths at a picnic
table Behind them Connie is tending to Simon who looks
ill

Dani warily approaches

INGEMAR (CONTD)
How are you feeling Everyone this
is Pelle’s friend Dani

Everyone says hi

DANI
They were laughing at me over
there

INGEMAR

What No I’m sure they weren’t
They probably just wanted you to
laugh with them

But Ingemar’s face was MUTATING as he said that

DANI
(terrified forcing a
smile)
Okay Sorry Never mind Thank you

Dani turns around and walks stiffly off

DANI (CONTD)
(trying to turn it around)
It’s okay It’s not that You’re
okay It’s drugs

She continues toward a sturdy wooden OUTHOUSE She hastily
enters and SHUTS the door

INT OUTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The interior of the outhouse is pitch- -dark We hear Dani
fumbling for a box of MATCHES After rummaging she STRIKES
one match and for the moment of the SPARK we vaguely see
TERRI (Dani s sister duct tape over her mouth) in the dark
behind Dani When the light settles that image disappears

The outhouse now illuminated by candle-light is very clean
and cramped Dani stands here for a moment

DANI
This is a coffin
(immediately reprimanding
herself)
Hey No it’s not

Dani sees a MIRROR on the wall She looks at it Hard

DANI (CONT’D)
Fuck you Stop it

Suddenly her skin seems to take on a translucent quality Her
veins become faintly visible Beneath her cheeks it looks
like organic gears are turning

DANI SQUEEZES HER EYES SHUT She takes a moment trying to
will that vision away

SALMON Revisions 26

DANI (CONTD)
Don’t look in the mirror It’s not
your face
(saying that again under
scrutiny)
“It’s not your face”

After a long moment Dani OPENS her eyes again When they

open TEN ADDITIONAL EYES open simultaneously - all over her
face Like spider eyes

Dani SCREAMS and FLEES the outhouse

EXT OUTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 27
Dani runs frantically across the field desperately wiping

off her face (as if to wipe off the extra eyes) We CHASE

AFTER HER before CUTTING TO

EXT FIELD - SAME TIME 28

Christian Josh Mark and Pelle are still lying in the same
spot They’ve hit the peak of their trip Twilight is coming

In the bg a group has finished setting up LARGE SPEAKERS

CHRISTIAN MARK (CONTD)

Droning techno begins to THROB from the speakers in the bg
With every bass punch the surrounding environment THUMPS
visibly

CHRISTIAN
Dani’s our friend And she’s sad

MARK
But that makes me sad
(suddenly angry )
And she’s NOT our friend She’s
barely YOUR friend

EXT WOODS - SAME TIME

Dani paces in the woods Muffled techno drones in the
distance

DANI

Hello HELLO

(redirecting her thoughts)
It’s almost your birthday Fuck
What time is it

(then PAUSES)
You were almost born You’re a
baby

This gets to Dani She now looks around the woods fearfully

Like a lost child

DANI (CONTD)
MOMMY DADDY
(silently to herself)
Mommy daddy mommy daddy
(absolutely panicked now)

CHRISTIAN
No answer

DANI (CONT’D)
Nono You’re alone

SALMON Revisions 28

Then it HITS Dani Her eyes well intensely with tears This
idea is now horribly significant

DANI (CONTD)
(a revelation)
You’re alone

Dani sees a DEAD RABBIT Its innards are splayed

the FEAR rises in her She gets close enough to finally see
The rabbit is being devoured by ANTS

Dani looks mortified but her eyes are glued She LEANS IN to
look closer but then -- she sees ANTS on her arm (Whether
theyre there or not is unclear )

Dani SCREAMS She gag start SLAPS at her arm She then swipes
at her other arm and starts slapping at her NECK and FACE
as if she were engulfed in ants (She’s not)

Dani looks down The earth seems to now be a PULSATING CARPET
OF ANTS

Dani SCREAMS and RUNS for her life As she sprints

CHRISTIAN (0S)
Dani

Dani FREEZES eyes crazed

DANI CHRISTIAN (0S) (CONTD)

Dani searches desperately for his voice She FINDS him
standing at a CLEARING he runs for him crying

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
Where the hell did you go

They EMBRACE She hugs him SQUEEZES him

DANI CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
I got lost Let’s go back to the group

DANI
(still squeezing)
Christian Nothing means anything

CHRISTIAN

ANT

(looking at him)
Nothing means anything We’re just
alone

(tearing up)
And I felt this presence - like God
but not God - and it was showing me
this and it was laughing at me

CHRISTIAN DANI (CONTD)

You heard laughing I felt it laughing I figured
it out that nothing means
anything and we’re all alone
and it was getting pleasure
from that

Dani warily approaches Magnetized but repulsed As she nears

SALMON Revisions 29

Christian is getting SCARED

CHRISTIAN
Okay just - calm down--

DANI
Oh my God what the fuck is that

Dani is now pointing to a BIG TREE in the BG SEVERAL BOAR
CARCASSES HANG FROM ITS BRANCHES Christian sees it but
instantly turns away - denying it

CHRISTIAN
(firmly)
No

He takes Dani’s ARM -

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
Fuck Stop it That wasn’t real We’re
going back to the friends Fuck

- and starts leading her away

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
Youre having a bad trip and you’re
thinking you’re alone because you
went off and you made yourself
alone You just got scared

He’s now PULLING Dani aggressively

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
(not even looking at her)
You have me Everything’s connected
We’re all one Those are the good
things you’ re supposed to think
about We’re all unified Fuck

Christian has been leading her out of the woods They emerge
onto the FIELD where the droning techno is now very present
(and making the visible surroundings THROB to its beat)

We track alongside Dani and Christian as they walk uneasily
through the grass - past groups of happy tripping strangers

Christian’s eyes are glued tensely to the ground combating
dark thoughts Dani looks less frightened now than
disconnected

They arrive at Josh Mark and Pelle who are now accompanied
res ZonNIE SIMON INGEMAR and the BLONDE SWEDISH GUITARIST
Os) who is still holding her guitar

BLONDE SWEDISH GUITARIST

29A EXT LARGE GRASSY MEADOW - WOODS - HOURS LATER
CLOSE-UP OF DANI’S SLEEPING FACE

In the distance a faint barely discernible melody It
sounds like a flute

A HAND reaches into frame to nudge Dani She stirs awake

CHRISTIAN (0OC)
It’s time to get up

DANI
-how long was I asleep

Dani sits up It’s still BRIGHT outside The visual
surroundings are no longer morphing Mark and Pelle and Josh
are standing Christian is crouched beside her

DANI (CONTD)

For a couple hours Not completely

Then something occurs to Dani

SINKS with quiet disappointment He forgot her birthday )

Everyone from the meadow CRUNCHES through the woods Our
group is at the end of the queue (carrying their bags) As

hypnotic tune

The group’s footing is unsteady Dani especially keeps
stumbling over her own feet She grips Christian’s wrist

paranoid steps)

summer a record number of people
got tick-borne encephalitis
MARK JOSH
What the fuck Are you (teasing)
serious Both my grandparents died
from ticks Hit the floor
screaming

Dani notices a few disparate FLOWERS sprouting up from the
ground As she walks the flowers continue to accumulate
Soon she’s walking down a controlled narrow TRAIL of wild
yellow flowers - all leading toward a CLEARING

MARK (0S)

Okay well I actually have an
uncle with Lyme and believe me
it’s not worth the pleasant picnic
in the countryside

The group finally arrives at the clearing It opens to
another FIELD beyond which is a SMALL VILLAGE

EXT HARGA FARMSTEAD - CONTINUOUS

It is a vast Halsingegard (a farm) About a HUNDRED PEOPLE
stand on the grass waiting They are dressed like farmers
from a Swedish fairy tale They appear to be a WELCOMING
COMMITTEE The melody we now see is being played by three
floutists A bundle of SPEAKERS (aimed upwards) amplifies
this

At the center of the farm is one particularly LARGE building
in the shape of a barn this is the MAIN HOUSE Surrounding
this are several houses a horse stable a temple and
different gardens The windows and doorways are all adorned
in ST JOHNS WORT (flowers with bright yellow petals and
golden stamens) Beyond the farmstead are fields of CROPS

Most of the arriving crowd is embraced ecstatically by the
welcoming committee They hug and kiss and squeal with
excitement It appears to be something of a REUNION Pelle
in particular is bombarded with affection (Many of the
arriving youths have ornamented robescostumes thrown over
them by the older people)

on sticks Others step up to take their bags Josh
meanwhile is manically taking photos with his smartphone

You know all these people

PELLE
These are my family

MARK (0S)
You know dude if you’d warned me
that this place was lousy with
ticks I could’ve at least brought
tweezers and like a spray

In the distance is a towering MAYPOLE Immense in height and
width it is entangled in lush green shrubbery and marked by
a wealth of symbols At the top of the pole is a TRIANGLE
beneath which hang two RINGS

While some of the welcoming committee take bags from our
group Pelle brings a beautiful young woman over This is
DAGNY She wears a white dress with intricate embroidery
(featuring distinct Pagan runes)

They all say thanks and Odd walks happily away

MARK
Nice guy

The music suddenly gets LOUDER Percussion is introduced and
the music swells to become a regal melody

Everyone’s attention moves to TEN GIRLS and BOYS (different
ages - from 7 to 13) all dressed in identical white dresses
and suits They hold FLORAL GARLAND CROWNS (made of mugwort
and vervain) and sprigs of LARKSPUR They are walking single-
file towards a PLATFORM

Sitting on the platform are TEN OLD MEN AND WOMEN (60s to
early 70s) These are the ELDERS They wear severe or neutral
expressions and are dressed in finely embroidered linen

The girls and boys march onto the platform They each stop to
the left of one of the seated elders Upon a cue they
simultaneously lay the crowns onto the elders’ heads (Two of
the elders receive slightly larger crowns) They then hand
the elders the larkspur sprigs After this the girls return
bashfully to the crowd

One of the elders - a sturdy older woman (60s) - rises to
address the crowd The music drops out She is beautiful
composed elegant This is SIV the spokeswoman

SIV
Glad midsommar allihopa

As she speaks several TEENS - all wearing outfits to
distinguish them as waiters - pass out shot glasses of
AQUAVIT

SIV (CONTD)
Valkomna till bords Vi har den
varsta varmeb6ljan i mannaminne

at the back of the crowd They receive shot glasses

SIV (CONTD)
Forgive me - I’m excluding the ones
who aren’t of Swedish tongue
Welcome to Harga and happy

Siv smiles

The crowd drinks Everyone CHEERS Including our group The
MUSIC begins again

On one side of the platform A young GIRL also wearing an

embroidered white dress walks up with a

JUNIPER BOUGH in

each hand She is accompanied by a TEENAGE BOY who holds two
FLAMING TORCHES Meanwhile two of the ELDERS have risen

from their seats These are YLVA and DAN They are the elders
with the larger crowns They move off the stage

Siv now speaks in English presumably for our group’s benefit
t

(As she does this t

e young girl an

men a juniper bough and flaming stick)

SIV
And now in keeping with tradition
Ylva and Dan will make three trips
If they return with the flame
intact our vintage will be abundant
this year Alternately if it burns
out - that will be an omen of bad
luck and we will know to prepare

Josh turns to Pelle

Siv yells

JOSH
What does “bad luck” mean
PELLE
Usually that the cattle will get

sick

PELLE
Told any lingering spirits to go
back to the dead

The two large-crowned elders now BLINDFOLDED begin to run
around the Main House holding up their flaming

sticks (Everyone watches rapt) phey pick up the pace to
finish their first cycle around the house They then begins
circling it again

JOSH
(to Pelle)
Can I take photos

PELLE
(winks )
Discretely

The elders finish their second cycle around the house and
immediately begin a third The community seems to be holding
its collective breath The elders FINISH the third run-around
to reveal that Ylva’s fire is still burning butDan’s
flame has been EXTINGUISHED

A man in the audience ISAK (50s) lets out a GASP when he
sees this Everyone else sinks audibly with disappointment

The elders having finished remove their blindfold The
elder with the extinguished torch DEFLATES Siv gestures
sadly to the crowd “There we have it”

Isak looks absolutely devastated Christian’s eyes are on
him

CHRISTIAN
(to Pelle)
He okay

PELLE
Haha The cattle are his
responsibility

Isak’s eyes stare off unblinking Heartbroken He looks to
the CATTLE HOUSE eyes filling with tears

MARK
(to Pelle and Christian)
How do you think he’d react if I
just put my finger in his butt
right now

Continuing the ritual Siv takes the torches from the elders
and walks to a healthy FIRE in a pit (this fire is always
burning never to be allowed to extinguish)

PELLE
(to Josh and Christian)
That fire hasn’t burned out since
before I was born It’s all of our
jobs to keep it going

It’s to keep the fire from

growing out of control

Josh WRITES this down in his notebook Christian WATCHES

Siv now accepts a BOWL OF BEER from one of the children She
drinks a healthy gulp and then throws the rest into the
fire Everyone now APPLAUDS clapping silently This seems to
be the end of the ritual

EXT HARGA FARMSTEAD - MINUTES LATER 31A

A group of TEENAGERS (all dressed in bright formal garb)
emerge from a kitchen They carry PLATES OF FOOD (lamb and
blood pudding) and BEER They begin by serving the elders

Dani sees that one of the teens is carrying an ornate platter
featuring a LAMB’S SKULL (brain exposed’ and a LAMB’S HEART
The platter is bordered by a dense spiral of INTESTINES This
is laid onto the center of a table that has been
painstakingly decorated with local flowers

PELLE
That’s a tradition They just
killed that lamb today

One server dumps a generous plate of food into the fire

Other servers now move to our group who are settling onto
the grass They are handed plates and beers

lovingly TOUCH him - as if in reverence

have joined hands to form a train of people They run and
dance in a long chain (the long dance”) The MAYPOLE stands
at the center of their circle

Maja timidly watches the dance smiling Her eyes trail off

Dani surprised opens the paper It’s a drawing of her FACE
(donned with an extremely lush floral crown) The style is
simple but her likeness is captured beautifully

DANT
Oh - my gosh Pelle

PELLE DANI (CONTD)
It’s just something I do for
birthdays Maybe it’s not
appropriate Oh my God not at all It’s
wonderful Thank you Pelle
I’m so touched

PELLE
Anyway Just between us

DANI
Yeah well - don’t worry Christian

Pelle PAUSES surprised He doesn’t know what to say
DANI (CONTD)
(immediately regretting)

Or - I forgot to remind him It

doesn’t matter Thank you so much

for this Pelle It’s beautiful
She folds the drawing back up
EXT HARGA FIELD - MINUTES LATER 34

The dance is over although separate groups are still dancing
and playing in the BG

Pelle is now leading our group on a TOUR (Ingemar Connie
and Simon have joined along) We track alongside

JOSH
How do you guys support this place
PELLE INGEMAR
Lumbering linen
homeopathics Water power plant

They pass a CIRCLE OF CHILDREN accompanied by a teacher (Dan)
They’re carving RUNIC SYMBOLS into smooth BONES

PELLE
Schooltime over here

CHRISTIAN
Carving runes

Dan takes a break from teaching to look up and smile
confirmation

PELLE
(to Dani)
Then they put it under their pillow
and dream about its power

Dani makes an “ooh” face Josh makes a NOTE of this

Christian sees that they’re now passing an old RUNESTONE (on
their other side) It stands erect in an untended field

SALMON Revisions 41

CHRISTIAN JOSH
Oh man - there’s a serious
one Oh shit

CHRISTIAN
Which alphabet is that from

JOSH
(quick to answer)
Looks like the younger Futhark
(to Pelle)
Right Or is that medieval

INGEMAR
That’s actually the Elder Futhark

Josh nods “Ah right” - visibly pained to be wrong

CONNIE
(to Christian and Dani)
So how long’ve you two been
together

DANI
Oh jeezalmost four years now

CHRISTIAN
(gently correcting)
Three and a half

DANI
(serious pause)
Youre joking 1 be three in
fifteen days

Christian thinks about that and grudgingly concedes

CHRISTIAN
Okay no that is true
(off Dani’s look)
It is You’re absolutely right

He makes a “Sowwy” face kisses her incredulous cheek and
changes the subject by asking Simon Connie and Ingemar

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
How did you guys all meet

They look at each other “Who answers”

INGEMAR
Wellwe were all working on the same
farm and funny enough I was dating
Connie when Simon and me first became
pals

Simon’s eyes narrow Connie looks very confused

CONNIE
(correcting)
Well - we‘d been on a date Which I
wasn’ ‘t even actually aware that it was a
ate

SALMON Revisions 42

INGEMAR
(backtracking jovially)
Right no I meant that Connie and
me had just become friends - we
decided to be friends - and that was
just before Connie and Simon started
dating And now theyre engaged

DANI INGEMAR (CONTD)
Oh wow Congratulations Which is amazing Yes
Congratulations

Simon and Connie look uncomfortable They smile “thank you”

SIMON
(to Pani)
Weve actually asked Ingemar to
officiate the wedding

DANI
(excited)
You did
SIMON
Nope

Everybody LAUGHS - including Ingemar

Christian points out a GIANT TRIANGULAR HOUSE which stands
isolated in a large field It has been painted a vivid
yellow (Two teen boys hang out beside it)

CHRISTIAN
What about that house

PELLE
Ah that’s like a sacred temple No
one’s allowed in there

CHRISTIAN
Looks like it was just built

MARK
(mock sinister tune)
Ooooweeeyooooh

Changing the subject Pelle motions toward the MAIN HOUSE

PELLE
Let me show you where we sleep

He leads them toward it Meanwhile Ingemar leads Simon and
Connie in another direction

INGEMAR
Here come see the Rotvdlta

Our group walks off into the BG and as they go Ingemar and
his crew walk profile in the MG We follow alongside them On
their way they pass a CAGED BEAR (which our group is also
passing with curiosity in the BG)

SIMON
So we’re just gonna ignore the
bear then

SALMON Revisions 43

INGEMAR
(acknowledging deadpan)
That’s a bear

Connie sees a LONG CARPET that has been hung up
(horizontally) on a clothesline in the FG She approaches to
check it out Simon follows

CONNIE
This is fucking cool

Continuing the lateral track we move slowly along it (having
now become Connie’s POV) In a series of seven panels the
carpet dramatizes the following

1) A love-stricken girl in a server outfit (profile) stares
longingly with hearts for eyes at a boy sitting frontal
2) The girl in a large field walking backwards as she
gathers flowers 3) A dual-panel first depicting The girl
laying flowers under her pillow And then the girl asleep
dreaming about the boy A dream bubble hovers over her head
Inside of it the girl and the boy (with spiraling eyes) are
kissing at their wedding 4) The girl in the kitchen She
crouches over a coffee cup and drips menstrual blood into the
cup 5) A triple panel first depicting The girl snips off
her pubic hairs then a close-up of the pubic hair being
snipped and then the girl mixing the disparate hairs into
pancake batter 6) The girl handing the boy the pancake as he
drinks the coffee 7) The boy’s face spirals for eyes 8)
The boy kisses the girl who is now pregnant in a wedding
dress They both have hearts for eyes

SIMON (0S)
Wait Is she dripping period blood
into the drink

CONNIE (0S)
How do you think I nailed you down

We have passed the carpet to see our group arriving at the
Main House in the BG

INT THE MAIN HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 35

Josh leads our group through the two-storied interior of the
huge barn-shaped house There is a large square HOLE in the
floor of the second story (so both stories are visible to
each other) On both floors the walls are lined with BEDS
The center of the bottom story is bare like a dance floor

MARK
Holy shit
(pointing out paintings)
Dick painting Dick painting Dick
with a pussy in the middle A pussy
shitting out a dick

Mark throws his bag onto one of them
The group marvels at the walls which are covered in

INTRICATE MURALS Runic letters abound The CEILING is
especially impressive

SALMON Revisions 44

CHRISTIAN
Who all sleeps in here

PELLE
All the younger ones Until we turn
thirty-six Then we move to the
laborer’s house

JOSH
Why thirty-six

Josh has pulled out his NOTEPAD ready to write down Pelle’s
answer Christian (almost in response) pulls out his phone
ready to type Pelle PAUSES at this He then explains
gesturing to a MURAL that dramatizes the following

PELLE
We think of life like the seasons
You are a child until 18 and
that’s the Spring At some point
we all do our Pilgrimage and
that’s between 18 and 36 That is
Summer Then from 36 to 54
youre of working age which is
Fall And finally from 54 to 72
you become a mentor

Josh and Christian have written all this down - their eyes
intermittently piercing each other (Josh finishes with “53-
72 -- Mentor -- WINTER” )

DANI
What happens when you turn 72
then

Pelle makes a comical THROAT SLASH gesture Dani laughs and
begins to walk off

CHRISTIAN MARK
Not a lot of privacy What do
you do when you need to jerk
off Or give yourself an enema

Now that Dani is away Pelle crosses quietly to Christian He
covertly ushers him aside

Dani has found a wall of many FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS They all
feature a different young woman dressed in ceremonial garb
In each photo the woman is richly adorned in summer flowers
and wears an impressive FLORAL CROWN These photos have been
taken annually for the last dozen years

Dani looks over to notice Pelle still talking to Christian
who now has one hand behind his back He looks extremely
GUILTY She interrupts by bluntly asking

DANI
Are these the May Queens

PELLE
Oh - that’s right You’ll actually
be here for that

CHRISTIAN
Who are the “May Queens”

SALMON Revisions 45

PELLE
Every midsummer we have a dance
competition and the winner gets
crowned

A PRETTY BRUNETTE steps up to the door

PRETTY BRUNETTE
(announcing)
Barnen tittar pa Austin Powers om

She looks to Mark SMILES bashfully and waves She then
leaves

MARK
Wait a minute Did you just see
that

Christian hand behind his back now sneaks over to Dani

CHRISTIAN
Hey Can I just pull you

Christian ushers her gently out of the front door They
move to the Front Steps Beyond them four women (all
different ages) are gathered closely as they SING SOFTLY
(heydihrudi) to a crying baby Struck by this Dani
watches this for a second As she does so Christian
produces a SOCKERKAKA (sponge cake) from behind his back A
candle protrudes

DANI
(confused)
What
CHRISTIAN

Happy birthday

He struggles to light the candle with a bad lighter He
finally succeeds

DANI
Where did that come from

CHRISTIAN
I’ve been trying to find a time to
surprise you all day

Dani just looks at him with utter suspicion

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
What You thought I forgot

Christian finally RELENTS with a guilty smile
CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m really sorry I
didn’t know it was tomorrow
already With the sun

He kisses her She doesn’t kiss back He keeps kissing

She forces a tight smile and BLOWS OUT the candle

EXT VILLAGE - “NIGHT” 38

A high angle wide of the village Almost everyone save for
some stragglers are inside The sun is low looking like
evening (but we are past midnight)

INT THE MAIN HOUSE - SAME TIME 38A

The windows have been boarded up for the night Soft sunlight
peeks from the edges

People are climbing into their beds The baby is still
CRYING now in his CRIB which is stationed near the beds
of women in their twenties The crib is made of severe-
looking iron and metal One woman lays a PAIR OF SCISSORS
under the baby’s mattress

Dani noticing this looks inquiringly to Pelle

PELLE
The iron keeps away the “invisibles”
So the babies don’t get “changed”

Pelle smiles sardonically knowing how it sounds

DANT
How real is that stuff for you guys

PELLE
(deflecting)
Ah who knows

Dani smiles She looks over to Christian whose eyes are GLUED
TENSELY to Joshs notepad as he scrawls “tron Babies changed
‘Invisibles’” Christian looks threatened

Pelle has already climbed into bed

Bemused Josh looks dead-eyed at Pelle Waiting for more

Pelle PAUSES then takes Josh’s notepad He writes
“Attestupan” and hands it back

Josh happens to know that word His eyes WIDEN “Are you
serious” Pelle smiles mischievously

CHRISTIAN
What’s that What’s Attestupan

Pelle gestures for Christian to keep his voice down
Christian pulls out his phone and types “Atestupan” into a
search engine But there’s no internet connection

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
Fuck
(to Josh and Pelle)
What’s Attestupan

Josh smugly climbs into bed This has made Dani nervous

DANI
(to Josh)
Is it scary

Josh teasingly raises his eyebrows “You’ll see”

MARK (0S)
Christian do you wanna check my
scalp for ticks and then I can check
your scalp

INT THE MAIN HOUSE - “NIGHT” 39
Everyone is asleep Silence save for the baby’s CRYING

Dani lies AWAKE Beside her Christian sleeping soundly To
her other side Mark SNORING

Dani shifts her weight She looks over at the wall mural and
notices an ILLUSTRATION of a HAPPY MAN OPENING HIS WRIST WITH A
SPECIAL KNIFE He is surrounded by smiling friends and above
him a smiling SUN Dani looks unnerved but her attention is
suddenly DRAWN AWAY by the SOUND of

A teenaged BOY and GIRL (clearly new lovers) sneak quietly
out of their beds Giggling They tip-toe out of the house
careful to make no noise

Dani stares at this Heavy

EXT FIELD - MORNING 42

In an open field a group of WOMEN collect the morning DEW
(in small vials) from the leaves and grass They throw a
SHEET over the wet grass It absorbs the dew and they WRING
it out into a pail

We TRACK ACROSS this finally panning away to findseveral
men are setting up DINING TABLES in the BG the fire temple
just beyond them They are laying the tables out to forma
runic pattern

SALMON Revisions 48

We continue panning past this to find a large GROUP that has
assembled for what appears to be some sort of DANCE CLASS (we
see them in a medium wide gently pulling back) They stand
in rows of ten At the head of the class is YLVA one of the
elders who carried the torch around the house In
demonstration she lifts her arm and waves it fluidly
rhythmically EMOTIONALLY back and forth (This is
accompanied by a Hargan OSKAR who sings a wordless emotion-
based song - not dissimilar to speaking in tongues The dance
is inspired by this song) The class IMITATES the dancer
They strive to perfectly match her movements and emotions
(Josh watches raptly in the BG)

Finally we’ve pulled back far enough to reveal Dani’s
shoulder in the FG She’s watching the dance class having
just woken up She then turns to look around marvelling at
the structure of the community around her She SITS DOWN
cross-legged being mindful to soak it in

EXT FARMSTEAD - ONE HOUR LATER

The dining tables have been set up to form a RUNE
(representing the “cultivation of art soul and craft”)

Half of the community is already standing at the tables The
other half is arriving now Plates of food have already been
placed No one sits

OUR GROUP (minus Dani) arrives at one of the tables They
gaze around trying to understand the etiquette They notice
that a few lingering GIRLS walk backwards through a
neighboring field picking FLOWERS

MARK
Someone should tell those girls
that they’re walking stupid

DANI now appears with a bouquet of HANDPICKED FLOWERS She
happily presents Christian with the bouquet

CHRISTIAN
What For me

DANI
Ja

CHRISTIAN

(accepting them with strained
appreciation)
-Tack sa mycket

He kisses her cheek

Now that everyone is stationed at the tables a BOY runs off
to officially summon the guests of honor by ringing a BELL at
the end of a table

After a moment TWO ELDERS both wearing ornate golden
dresses enter the scene (We will recognize them as Dan and
Ylva the elders who ran around the Main House with the
flaming torches) They stand with alert posture maintaining
an awareness of their bodies as they walk They arrive at TWO
LARGE WOODEN CHAIRS situated at the head of a beautifully
decorated table with fine silverware and golden plates
(Every other table seats at least five people but this table
has been reserved solely for these two)

SALMON Revisions 49
43 43

Josh mouths to Pelle “Are those the ones” Pelle smiles
The two elders SIT This prompts everyone else to sit

Mark picks up his fork only to notice that no one else has
begun eating Everyone waits patiently Total SILENCE save
for the baby who is still crying

Finally the two men pick up their silverware and begin to
eat Now everyone starts eating

Josh is scrutinizing every detail Christian scrutinizes
Josh

43A EXT FARMSTEAD - MID-MEAL 43A

MAJA feverishly carvesa small RUNE STONE in her lap She is
hunched over to conceal her progress from curious eyes

The two elders are receiving lots of attention

Next to Dani a blonde woman KARIN (20s) cradles the CRYING
BABY She rests her forehead’ against the baby’ s forehead and
moans empathically She notices Dani watching this and she
turns and SMILES

DANI KARIN
(catching herself)
Oh God I’m sorry I was No no
gawking
DANI
Is your baby okay
KARIN
Oh she will be She has the em
- rickets Where the bones are
bad She is not “mine” though
DANI BLONDE WOMAN
Oh I’m sorry to presume No no - her birth mother is

on pilgrimage It helps them
to detach The babies are
raised here by everyone

Dani smiles at this idea Josh and Christian are also taken
by this Josh SEES Christian’s excitement and quietly
HARDENS

KARIN
to Dani)
How is your family like

DANI
Mine Oh no mine are

Dani makes a comic throat-slashing gesture recalling
Pelle’s she then instantly feels guilty about it Christian
suddenly looks nervous about this exchange

KARIN
Oh no I’m so sorry All of them

Karin already has TEARS welling in her eyes She looks
sincerely affected by this

Am I making you sad to ask

DANI
No not at all I just shouldn’t have
mentioned it

BLONDE WOMAN DANI (CONTD)
Please know we can talk if
you like Please I am happy
to talk

(uncomfortable)
Okay thank you Sorry I
feel silly Thank you
(to Christian)

Sorry
Christian shrugs “Don’t apologize to me”
SIV a table over has been avidly watching this exchange
43B EXT FARMSTEAD - MID MEAL - MINUTES LATER 43B

Everyone has finished eating Another HUSH falls awkwardly over
the procession Silence save for the wailing baby

Mark half-asleep confusedly looks around He sees the
Pretty Brunette (from earlier) SMILING athim Caught off
guard he BLUSHES and smiles back (a little too eagerly)

One of the two elders STANDS This is YLVA She clears her
throat Closes her eyes After a moment Ylva begins to SING
a wordless choral song

Everyone watches rapt and emotional

At the appropriate time the other man (DAN) begins to sing
along softly and awkwardly at first Soon he rises singing
with greater projection

MARK
(whispering to Josh)
How do you think he’d react if I
just put my finger in his butt
right now

When the song comes to a finish SIV stands to RAISE her
glass This prompts everyone else to stand They all raise
their aquavit

A long silence Everyone is very calm And present Dani is
MOVED She holds up her glass feeling energy from the group

Siv Finally DRINKS So does everyone else The MUSICIANS

begin to P ay their handmade instruments and EIGHT MIDDLE-
AGED MEN break into two groups They walk to either of the
elder’s chairs HOIST them up and start CARRYING THEM OFF

carried up a hill Our group JOINS them confused Mark lags

Mark heads back toward the Main House Dani Christian Josh
and Pelle proceed to follow the community

EXT HILL - MINUTES LATER 44

Everyone happily follows the elders of honor (still carried
on hoisted thrones) They follow a narrow TRAIL OF FLOWERS up
a hill

There is a FORK in the trail leading either to the left and
downward or continuing straight ahead and upward

Ylva and Dan are carried straight ahead continuing to ascend
the rising hill The following procession BRANCHES OFF to
veer left They continue down a slope that leads to the
valley of a cliff

Our group squinting with curiosity begins following the
procession toward the valley But Pelle slows down

PELLE
Okay - actually

He holds them back

PELLE (CONTD)
I need to warn you before we go
down
(to Dani now)
-because you could not want to

DANI
Is this the thing you mentioned
last night

JOSH
(smirking)
Attestupan

PELLE
Were about to perform a centuries-—
old ritual that is very important to
us and very beautiful but also -
very far from anything you have in
America

DANT
(suddenly nervous)
-Do I not want to do this

PELLE

Well - that’s what I’m saying
Youre invited to I just

(pauses)
You remember I explained the winter
stage of a man’s life 54 to 72
Well this is what happens when 72
gets reached

DANI
Okay And what is “this”

Pelle pauses considering his words Dani grows more nervous

SALMON Revisions 52

DANI (CONTD)
What is Attestupan

Josh can’t suppress a smile - anticipating Pelle’s answer
EXT VALLEY - MINUTES LATER

The community has gathered on the rocky valley Tall CLIFFS
loom imposingly The baby cries in the BG

Our group stands to the side along with Simon Connie and
Ingemar Christian turns to DANI who looks extremely uneasy

CHRISTIAN
Are you sure you can handle this

Dani doesn’t know the answer to this

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
Maybe you should go back to the
main house It’s not too late

Dani starts to wrestle with this but then

DANI
No I need to try

A HORN sounds All eyes go to

SIV holds a WOOD-BOUND BOOK whose cover is marked by runic
letters She opens it and reads in silence for a moment Its
scripture is written in runes and unknown hieroglyphs (the
AFFECT language)

JOSH
(to Pelle whispering)
What’s that book

Christian leans in to hear the whispered answer

PELLE
Rubi Radr Our scripture

JOSH
Can I read that

PELLE
You would not be able

CU of Rubi Radrs pages as held open by Siv They are indeed
indecipherable to common eyes

Siv eyes on the page surprises our group by beginning to
SING a wordless hymn It’s beautiful yet feels improvised
as if inspired (on the spot) by emotions provoked by the
text

EXT CLIFF - SAME TIME

The two elders have been carried to the top of a CLIFF
overlooking the beach Their chairs are SET DOWN near the
precipice They are placed beside freshly carved (and
impressively sized) RUNE STONES

The elders rise from their seats and then stoically put out
their hands Specially ordained men then draw CEREMONIAL
BLADES across their palms DRAWING BLOOD

SALMON Revisions 53

Ylva and Dan rub their palms together making their hands
nice and bloody They press their palms onto their rune
stones both leaving TWO BLOODY HAND-PRINTS

45A EXT BEACH - SAME TIME 45A

Everyone looks up at the cliff’s peak Dani is SWEATING BEADS
now her breathing erratic

Finally YLVA appear at the edge
Rapt silence
Ylva stands there for a long time

Mesmerized Josh steps slowly to the side (away from Dani and
Christian) to get a better look His eyes are glued to the
cliff-top

Ylva having now summoned total confidence assumes a GRAND
POSE twisting her arms and legs into a standing fetal
position and extending her neckhead into a glorious reach
for the heavens This pose represents a final statement

Dani BRACES herself Her TEETH begin to chatter She GRABS
Christian’s arm and then --

Ylva LEAPS OFF THE PRECIPICE Connie and Simon SCREAM The
woman plummets 200 feet to LAND FATALLY on the jagged rocks
below Upon impact a FLOCK OF BIRDS ALIGHTS from a tree
Connie SCREAMS

Our group is shocked into horrified silence Dani looks like
she’s been knocked out of her bod The birds fly over Dani’s
head and a sudden rush courses t rough her

Disassociated Dani turns to look at Connie and Simon who
are freaking out

Then Christian points upward redirecting Dani’s dazed
attention to the cliff-top Dani’s EYES scan back up to
see

DAN - the elder whose torch burnt out before circling the
house three times - is now stepping up to the precipice He
also strikes a POSE also reaching for the awesome but his
is slightly clumsier He wobbles but he holds the pose
While holding it he turns to look downat Dani

SIMON
(panicking)
What’s happening Is he gonna jump
too No--

Dan LAUNCHES HIMSELF OFF THE CLIFF jumping vertically
Connie GASPS Dan plummets straight down but his left foot
lands on the large rock that killed Ylva This obliterates
his leg and sends him falling brutally to his side Dan
unfortunately not dead WAILS in horrible pain

The community grumbles with concern Everyone turns to
THREE MEN - each the oldest of their respective generations
(the youths the laborers and the mentors) They
understand what they must do

SIMON (CONTD)
Why did that just happen We need
to call an ambulance

INGEMAR SIMON (CONTD)
It’s okay What’s okay CALL AN
AMBULANCE Everybody’s just
watching

Sten approaches the three men with a CUDGEL This is along-
handled club with a pointed block of wood at the end The
cudgel is handed over to the MENTOR

Dani watches overwhelmed as the three men (now armed with
the cudgel) stalk over to Dan The dying man moans
pathetically in too much pain to scream

From DANIS POV The men have arrived at Dan’s feet The
mentor RAISES the cudgel and brutally swings it down onto
Dan’s HEAD This isn’t a fatal blow The man raises the
cudgel again and this time he STRIKES Dan with enough
force to silence him

The mentor hands the cudgel to the LABORER He raises the
cudgel and brings it down onto the old man’s crown The
elder’s leg goes into pathetic SPASMS Blood gurgling The
jaborer BLUDGEONS him once more Dan goes limp probably
ea

The YOUTH is now handed the cudgel He delivers two brutal
swings to Dan’s head The mentor gently takes the cudgel away
from the youth and they all return to the community The
mentor hands Sten the cudgel and everyone stands in
respectful contemplative silence

Dani is GRIPPING Christian’s arm She is completely shell-
shocked Christian turns to Josh they exchange “holy shit”
looks More EXCITED than troubled

Siv bounds over to Connie and Simon who are in a panic Dani
trembles powder-white Traumatized

SIV INGEMAR
Ingemar Did you not warn I’m sorry grandmother Siv I
them kind of warned them
SIMON

Nobody did anything Everyone just
watched that

SIV SIMON (CONTD)
Oh my poor things-- You’re all just standing
calmly around

SIV
Oh mercy - please--

Siv tries to lay an empathic hand on Simon and Connie’s
shoulder but Simon RECOILS

SIV (CONTD) SIMON
You should have been warned
better What you just saw is
a long long long observed
custom Those two men have Custom
just reached the end of their
life-cycle
45A

SALMON Revisions 55

Siv now looks into DANIS eyes but Dani is in a daze She
seems to have been knocked into a dissociative state Siv
speaks quickly to avoid being interrupted

SIV

You must understand it as a great
joy for them And when it is my
turn it will be great joy for me

back to Simon and Connie)
We view life like a circle Yes A re-
cycle One thing falls and another
raises The first lady who jumped her
name was Ylva Yes

Siv points to a PREGNANT WOMAN

SIV (CONTD)
That baby who is not yet born
will inherit this name and also be
Ylva And if it’s a boy he will
take the name of Dan

Dani gazes atSiv who has taken on a strange ETHEREAL GLOW
(like an angel)

SIV (CONTD)
But instead of getting old and dying
with shame and pain and fear we
give our life As a gesture Out of
gratefulness Before it can spoil

Siv releases Simon and Connie who are no less fraught Siv
now addresses the whole group

SIV (CONTD)
It does no good to die lashing
back at the inevitable It
corrupts the spirit

INGEMAR
(to Simon and Connie)
I’m sorry I did not warn you
better

How would I know that Oh my God Christian of
Did you even know that before course you did

I just told you

JOSH (CONTD)
You think I don’t know what you’re
doing It’s actually kind of
outrageously unsubtle The fact that
you re being this bald about it I’m
onestly impressed

CHRISTIAN
What the fuck

JOSH

Oh yeah - “What the fuck”

(seething)
This is what I’ve been working
towards and youknow it That’s why
you look so guilty right now
Because you know - you know - that
what you’re 2oing is unethical and
leechy and lazy and frankly kind of

Sad--
CHRISTIAN JOSH (CONTD)
Okay wow fuck you-- No dude not fuck me Find

your own subject - or your
own passion Because I’m
actually invested in this
It’s not some glorified hobby
that I’m casually dipping my
feet into

CHRISTIAN
Oh my God In case you forgot Your
Highness we’re both earning the
same degree--

JOSH
But we’re not doing it in the same
way Christian Okay I have to hold
your little hand through everything
You didn’t even know how to use J-Stor
before I taught you and you’re a
fucking grad student I mean why are
you even in academia You don’t care

This cuts Christian like a knife His eyes are flaring with
RAGE But he stifles it Determined to remain collected he

Josh sits motionless

EXT FARMSTEAD - CONTINUOUS

Christian emerges from the Main House extremely tense Near
the door a very pale SIMON smokes a cigarette with Connie
Mark stands with them stunned

MARK
Wait though for real The two old
ones With the singing

SIMON CONNIE
I can’t stay here four more
days I’m sorry That’s fine I can’t either

Mark turns to Christian

MARK
Christian dude of all the things
to let me sleep through

Simon sees Christian’s demeanor

SIMON
We feel the same way mate

Fuming Christian just acknowledges Simon with a tight-lipped
smile Looking out he then notices in the FIELD several men
and women are decorating a TREE that has been pulled from the
earth and is now elevated on its side Among the decorators
he sees MAJA working with her friend ULLA They laugh
as they work

Christian gestures “excuse me” to Simon and approaches Maja
As he walks toward her he passes several other people
working in the BG

CHRISTIAN
Excuse me Hi Sorry to bother
you

Maja looks up - not understanding She looks almost panicked

MAJA
(not sure of the word)
Hello

YOUNG WOMAN
Hello I am Ulla She is Maja

CHRISTIAN
Hi Ulla Maja I uh -- What are you
guys doing

ULLA
Decorating the tree

Christian tries to ignore that Maja is staring at him with
wide eyes Some of the working men also stare

CHRISTIAN
I was wondering uh if I could
ask -
(pulls out pen and paper)
- how many of those Attestupans you
guys have seen performed

ULLA
Every time one reaches age

CHRISTIAN ULLA (CONTD)
Okay So lots

CHRISTIAN
Right Okay And what would be like
a typical mourning period For
grieving

ULLA
We grieve and celebrate

Maja is still staring at Christian love-stricken He is
aware of it but tries to ignore

ULLA (CONT’D)
We must go now and keep work going

CHRISTIAN
Okay « No problem Thank you I
might find you to ask more later

Ulla smiles “okay” and walks off with Maja They wave
goodbye

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
Goodbye

‘Bye Maja

Maja smiles timidly and waves goodbye again

JOSH is standing near the stage talking to PELLE

JOSH
And I told Christian this already
and now I think he’s trying to
pretend that it was his idea so if
he comes to you--

PELLE
Well no hey wait a minute I
seriously doubt the elders will
approve of anything being written
They’re extremely protective

JOSH
So I can just use aliases for
everything Solved

PELLE
Then what would be the point You
couldn’t even get it peer reviewed
(before Josh can argue)
Christian did already ask me this
by the way I told him the exact
thing I’m telling you

JOSH
-I thought you just said he
hadn’t talked to you

PELLE
(annoyed)
Fuck look I’ll ask the elders
But if it is approved you either
both do it together or you fight it
out between yourselfs

Pelle puts his hands up to signify “That’s it” He walks off

Are you just not at all disturbed
by what happened

CHRISTIAN
I mean of course it was shocking
But I’m also trying to keep an open
mind

Dani just stares at him

CHRISTIAN (CONTD)
It’s - cultural We abandon our
elderly to nursing homes I’m sure
they find that disturbing

Dani EYES him disturbed by his nonchalance She then sees

In the bg a congregation of MEN and WOMEN (all holding
lanterns) are migrating off together At the front of the
queue are men carrying the BEJEWELLED TREE (which we saw the
men decorating earlier)

DAGNY whom we met earlier splits from the group to RUN over

GLOW in the distance

DANI

Someone better not be launching off

Christian sees MARK behind them and slows down to join him

CHRISTIAN

speaks like zero English

Mark is talking about the PRETTY BRUNETTE from earlier She
walks behind them (a few bodies away) Christian turns to

IRMA stands at the center of the shore She SINGS a brief
wordless song and then announces to the lake

IRMA

Music is played as the men HOIST up the lavishly decorated
tree run it towards the lake and HURL it into the water
The lake gulps the tree down

A HORN bellows

A thin man SVEN (40s) steps out to announce quite
theatrically

Horns are played as Bror steps forward to stand before the
men who tossed the tree They reluctantly strap WEIGHTS to
the boy’s ankles and arms They then lift the boy up and
carry him to the lake

Dani starts to PANIC
DANI
(to Siv)
No What’s happening
Siv SMILES
The boy is taken to the edge of the lake and the men begin
to SWING him back and forth They are preparing to launch him
into the water

DANI (CONTD)
NO

This mingles with other protestations from the crowd

HARGAN 1
Nej sluta

The crowd erupts into a CACOPHONY OF STAGED PROTEST (”No
Release him”) The men stop swinging the boy After
sufficient heckling the men RELEASE the boy He then runs to
SIV bashfully burying his face into her dress She pats his
head with pride

Okay look I know it’s weird

level of tradition And
nobody knows about it

nobody’ s written on it — and
they’ve invited us to be part
of it Can’t you see what a
privilege that is

Because Pelle did
But why have they invited us
Because he trusts us

And why did Pelle

DANI
And why would he trust you of all
people You’re opportunistic
anthropology students

CHRISTIAN DANI (CONTD)

Maybe because were

anthropologists Maybe they

want someone to document Oh my God are you blind

rituals People are jumping
off cliffs They depend on
nobody knowing about this

Not necessarily

Dani HESITATES seeing that she’s getting nowhere

Then you can leave I invited you
to come and I don’t regret that

Beat Christian’s eyes are ice cold

DANI

At lunch I grabbed those on a

whim
CHRISTIAN DANI (CONTD)
Oh yeah Yes
You have no ulterior motives What motives would I have

Beneath each animal a narrow CHANNEL has been pre-carved

converge thus forming THREE MASSIVE RUNIC SYMBOLS The blood
pours from each animal to run down the separate canals Soon
the blood has co-mingled to fill the carefully-engineered
runic sculpture It’s horrible and beautiful

That’s not what I’m talking about

SALMON Revisions PELLE
I know and that’s fine but
please My birth-parents both died
when I was a little boy They burned
up in a fire and I became -
technically - an orphan So believe
me when I say I know what that is
because I do Yet my difference is
I didn’t get a chance to feel lost
Because I had a family - here -
where everyone embraced me and swept
me up and I was raised by a
community that doesn’t bicker over
what is theirs and what is not
theirs That’s what you were
sacrificed to But I —have always
feltheld By a family A real
family Which everyone deserves And
you deserve

Sacrifice is essential in any
relationship Let’s put it in your

terms-—

SIMON
What are my terms You don’t know
my terms-——

STEN

Say you’re entangled with a lover
who can’t put your needs before
her own

CONNIE
What does that mean

STEN

(to Connie now)
Say your partner can’t part with
even a fraction of his own comfort
to give you what you need And show
that youre appreciated

(to both of them now)
Wouldn’t you resent them Wouldn’t
you start to neglect them yourself
Maybe yourd even want to punish them

glances over at Christian smiling at him He SMILES back She
coyly sits a few people over The electricity between them is
pable

The music STOPS abruptly again All the dancers turn around
switching hands As the music starts again one woman TOPPLES
to her side bringing down two of her neighbors She and one
other laugh the third woman is furious

EXT FIELD - MAYPOLE - LATER 95A

Many of the women have now been disqualified Dani is still
in the running She seems determined to stay alert and
compete There are TEN remaining women five run in one
direction and the other five run in the opposite direction
weaving around each other

Christian sits among the onlookers He is chilled by his
last encounter with Dani Suddenly he notices ULLA
(whom he metearlier) walking toward him She arrives at
his feet holding out the CUP of the flower-spiked

water

ULLA

Spring water with special

Breaks down your defenses and opens
you for the influence

Christian looks back to Maja She’s now looking directly at
him Her eyes are languid confident She doesn’t break the
gaze

Christian turns to Ulla and accepts the water He sips it
Sips it again KNOCKS it back

Settling into the idea that he’s now going to hallucinate
Christian looks back to the MAYPOLE The women are still
dancing in a circle

Karin’s and she is tired and stumbling

Dani severely disoriented is led aside by several women
One woman wraps her in a sort of gown (composed only of
greenery and flora) and then she is directed to stand before
a gorgeous view of the field Her distracted attention is
pointed to a MAN holding a large old FILM CAMERA He takes

But Christian doesn’t understand it himself He shakes his
head to say “I don’t know”

DANI (CONTD)
(pleadingly to the
surrounding women)
What does this mean What do I have
to do

The women answer with hugs warm smiles and kisses on the
cheek Their faces sotke subtly (a product of the
psychedelics) Amon e people who kiss her are her MOTHER
and FATHER and SISTER (Terri) She looks back for them but
they have disappeared A figment of her imagination

Caught in the hallucination Dani falls into a traumatized
daze PELLE breaks the spell by giving Dani an enthusiastic
hug

PELLE
Holy cow you won May Queen

He gives her a blunt passionate KISS on the lips Before she
can react Pelle is replaced by two new women also kissing
and hugging her

Dani is then led to a ROUND WOODEN PLANK (painted gold and
shaped like a cartoon SUN) with six long protruding handles
She is directed to STAND on it

KARIN
Careful

The handles are gripped bye six men and Dani is swiftly
HOISTED UP She almost falls but doesn’t She is elevated
five feet above the ground as the crowd erupts into mirthful
SONG

The song persists as Dani still on her pedestal is carried
across the field All eyes are on her Everyone follows her

DANI
(searching)
Christian

But Christian has lagged to the back of the crowd He looks
extremely conflicted His eyes move to Maja whose eyes are
TRAINED on him She smiles widely but her eyes are faded

Christian slows to a stop as the procession continues

Meanwhile Dani’s confusion and fear is beginning to subside
She looks down at the procession to see that these people are
indeed celebrating her A few women even persist in throwing
rose petals up at her

Dani now calm looks down to see that her FEET and LEGS have
assumed the GOLD color of the plank (like a chameleon)

EXT FIELD - DINING AREA - LATER

The crowd arrives at today’s DINING AREA In a LUSH
FIELD the tabletops are made of MIRRORS and they are
all queued up to form a long straight jine At the
head of the table is a HUGE CHAIR (more like a throne)
adorned in lush greenery and bright flora

Dani’s pedestal is set down Members of the crowd step aside
to create a PATH for Dani’s trajectory (toward the throne)

Dani takes a moment before stepping decisively onto the
GRASS

When Dani’s FOOT touches the grass small SUMMER FLOWERS
magically SPROUT UP around her foot Her next step is the same
Flowers emerge impossibly from the soil She continues to walk
forward having now assumed a more self-possessed posture
Confidence is rising in her and with every step more flowers
sprout up She’s leaving a beautiful trail of wild flowers in

er wake

Dani STOPS at the throne Everyone now finds their way to their
seats but no one sits They look to her She looks momentarily
confused but then understands She SITS Now everyone may sit

Dani admires her green throne The greeneryflora subtly
SWELLS and DEFLATES (as we saw before with the mushroom
trip)

SERVERS appear with plates Dani is the first person to
receive food and drink Her tableware is much finer than the
rest

Looking down at her food Dani suddenly catches her
reflection in the tabletop mirror Her face looks wrong She
quickly LOOKS AWAY

Before long everyone has food in front of them They sit
with their hands on their laps present They WAIT for Dani

Dani picks up her FORK She looks back to the rest of the
table They all look back at her with patience She then
looks down and PIERCES her food with the fork (The sound of
the piercing is heightened) Dani takes a BITE Now everyone
may begin eating

Dani looks down the length of the extended table She alights
on CHRISTIAN who isn’t eating He looks very disturbed
clearly suffering a bad trip He looks in Dani’s direction
They LOCK EYES but communicate nothing to each other They
are both lost in confusion but they don’t share in this If
anything they look SCARED of each other

This moment is broken by a SERVER arriving at Dani’s side He
presents her with a SALT HERRING The community sees this and
aughs knowing what’s in store

DANI

STEN
You must eat it whole but the tail

Laughter all around

Sivgestures in the direction of a CARRIAGE just beyond the
tables Its back sports TWO UNLIT TORCHES Several girls (six
to pull the carriage and six to accompany it) surround it

One GIRL scatters flowers to create a PATH between Dani and
the carriage Dani RISES Everyone else stands up too

DANI
Can Christian come with me

SIV
No The Queen must ride alone

Dani pauses to accept this She steps onto the floral path and
approaches the carriage On the way Hanna offers her a LONG

unlit torches

Dani walks to the carriage extends the stick’s flame toward
the torches and sets them each AFIRE

Hanna takes the stick back from Dani and gestures for her to
enter the carriage A TRADITIONALLY DRESSED MAN stands beside
the carriage door He hands Dani a VIAL OF HOLY SPRING WATER
and offers Dani his hand (for support) as she contemplates
entering

Dani accepts his supportive hand as she climbs into the
carriage

Outside several YOUNG WOMEN (including HANNA) have gathered
in front of the carriage They each take hold of RODS
prepared to pull the carriage

A few other women have gathered to the sides of the carriage

torches They IGNITE their torches by the fire of the

which Christian can disrobe)

The women pulling the carriage have slowed to a STOP Dani
is directed by Hanna to step out Hanna holds the flamin
torch over a small HOLE in the ground Dani is instructe
to hold the torch by its handle (just above where Hanna
grips it) Hanna now affects perfect posture Dani
instinctively mimics this

Three women - each holding a sack of GRAIN a raw STEAK and
an EGG - approach the hole One pours grain into the hole
the other drops the steak over the grain and the last woman
cracks the egg into it The hole is then COVERED UP with

soi

begin to cloud over He EXHALES heavily (coughing the last
bit out) He’s already feeling the effects His breathing
becomes shallow and his legs start to wobble

The Man Whose Hair Envelops His Face now OPENS THE DOORS to
the temple Quiet humming is heard from inside

INT TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS 103
It is dark save for several burning candles

In the center of the room lying on a lush bed of freshly cut
birch twigs and WILD FLOWERS is MAJA She is NUDE lying on
her back legs together

Several OLDER WOMEN mostly in their 30s and 40s (some in
their 50s and 60s) stand at the back of the room They are
also NUDE The humming comes from them

Christian is too stoned to react He regards the room as he
would a dreamscape

The humming starts to build as the women SING in the Hargas’
wordless groaning microtonal tradition

Maja tilts her head and her eyes move toward the front
doorat Christian

One Woman now steps up to draw Christian’s gown OFF of his
shoulders He is fluidly DISROBED Now standing naked he is
directed towards Maja who waits nervously

Christian seems to LEVITATE six inches off the ground and
then FLOATS gently across the room (clearly a product of the
escalating hallucination) As he a proaches Maja the
singing intensifies Maja’s LEGS timidly PART Christian
approaching swiftly looks down at her Her eyes are closed
ag she waits to be taken The singing rises to an operatic
pitch

legs preparing himself He looks extremely intoxicated

Maja’s eyes are Squeezed shut as she anticipates what’s coming
Christian awkwardly leans down to gently KISS her lips Without
opening her eyes She kisses back - slowly sensually The
singing rises and falls (out of harmony) with trembling
impatience

Christian gently presses himself into Maja Her mouth opens
in anticipation He ENTERS her Overwhelmed Maja digs her
nails into his back Her eyes well with tears Christian
looks unsettled but he continues

Christianis now MAKING LOVE to Maja very slowly - almost
robotically She lies motionless mouth agape e doesn’t
move a muscle nor does she make a sound but her expression
is one of total paralyzed ECSTASY The singing has now
HARMONIZED

The Older Women watch this with rapt attention They are clearly
aroused The lovemaking is dreamily slow The singing rises
steadily Delayed percussion accompanies each heavy lagging
THRUST

Maja looks back at one of the women It is ULRIKA She smiles
tenderly at her This would be touching if it weren’t so
weird Maja offers Ulrika her HAND and Ulrika supportively
takes it into her hands Ulrika lovingly presses her CHEEK
against Maja’s open palm CARESSING her face

Maja MOANS The women all MOAN in sympathy (They have taken
to rubbing their breasts)

seems DRAWN to it

Dani attractedworried by the singingmoaning takes a few
steps toward the Temple The young women look very
concerned Hanna steps up to STAND IN DANI’S WAY

PUSHES ahead The women remain where they are very worried

Dani enters the foyer of the temple Beyond the closed doors
the singingmoaning has reached an operatic intensity

Dani takes a moment to gather herself and then she bends
down to peer through the door’s KEYHOLE

Through the keyhole Dani sees Christian’s BACK as he “makes
love” to Maja The surrounding women have fallen deeper into
their trance They are all HOLDING THEIR BREASTS With every
one of Christian’s thrusts the women PUMP THEIR BREASTS WITH
THEIR HANDS - moaning in tandem with Maya Dani’s eyes go
WIDE with horror

Stunned Dani backs away from the keyhole She suddenly
doubles over and RETCHES She rushes out of the temple

state of shock Her breathing is shallow and she looks
anxiously around as if confused as to her whereabouts

panicking

all hurriedly guide her in that direction

gathering intimately around her Dani struggles increasingly
to breathe

Hanna HOLDS Dani’s FACE in her hands She locks eyes with
Dani and affects DEEP BREATHING Dani’s eyes unwilling to
settle at first gradually become FIXED to Hanna’s Hanna
continues to affect deep measured breathing Dani struggles
to follow her Her breathing trembles to meet Hanna’s
example

Finally Dani BREAKS DOWN into tears Everything she’s
bottled up all the emotions that she’s labored to stifle -
it all comes BURSTING out She falls into deep anguished
SOBS

Still locked onto Dani’s gaze Hanna also breaks down She
SOBS DEEPLY along with Dani They are sympathetically
connected It’s remarkable and very unsettling

The surrounding women have also started CRYING althou he not
as intensely as Hanna who has absolutely fixed hersel

Dani The crying is infectious and the deeper they go the
greater the outpour

It has become a circle of hysterical weeping women They
moan and scream and cry It’s positively TRIBAL

The ceremony has nearly reached its apogee The singing has
eaked and Christian is thrusting faster and harder than
efore Maja eyes still closed is in a state of absolute

EUPHORIA She moans in ecstasy and the room has filled with

a cacophony of sympathetic moans

Christian suddenly looks ill He begins to slow down

MAJA
(in Swedish)
No Don’t stop

Christian looks like he’s going to be sick

One of the OLD WOMEN (60s) crouches behind Christian She
PUSHES on his buttocks urging him to thrust faster She keeps
pushing and pushing until Christian’s thrusts have gained in
orce

Christian continues to push until he finally CLIMAXES The
Old Woman releases him and backs away

and sits on the ground He looks ge fer k traumatized Maja
looks as euphoric as ever She hugs her knees to her chest
and gently rocks herself back and forth

buttocks She smiles toothlessly at him He’s definitely going
to be sick He STANDS suddenly taking in the room with
growing repulsion He turns to amble dizzily out of the
temple

EXT TEMPLE - BOOK BINDING - CHICKEN COOP - CONTINUOUS 111

Christian exits the temple He looks around increasingly
disoriented He looks down to see the fresh puddle of Dani’s
VOMIT This triggers him to retch He moves desperately away
from the vomit

Standing at a distance several isolated Hargans watch
Christian stumbling about Christian tries to ignore them He
walks toward the MAIN HOUSE but as he approaches he hears
the CHORUS OF CRYING (coming from Dani and the young women)
and he immediately changes his trajectory

Christian is now walking toward the BOOK BINDING HOUSE

As he nears the house he sees that the TRUCK (which was
supposedly stolen) is now parked beside it Christian’s eyes
buzz with suspicion

He then looks downwardat a GARDEN in front of the book
binding house It is in the shape of a CIRCLE And at the
heart of that circlea FOOT its sole facing skyward
protrudes from the soil A symbol has been painted onto the
sole (It is Josh’s foot)
SALMON Revisions 109

Christians eyes are wild with terror He rigidly turns
around his heart pounding panic taking hold

(to himself in denial)
That’s not that That wasn’t

He walks off hurriedly toward a SMALL HOUSE He opens the
door to reveal that it’s a CHICKEN COOP

INT CHICKEN COOP - CONTINUOUS

Christian enters He shuts the door behind him Chickens flap
stupidly about

Christian tries to regain his composure But as he tries to
steady his breath he SEES

Across the room SIMON - naked - is suspended midair His
arms are outstretched his body faced downwards and it
looks like he’s flying (In fact he’s being held up by
flora-decorated ropes ) Ais BACK HAS BEEN OPENED UP his
RIBS SEPARATED FROM HIS SPINE (reaching outward 1iké claws )
and his LUNGS HAVE BEEN PULLED UP TO LOOK LIKE OUTSPREAD
WINGS It appears that his bloody “wings” have also been
covered in bird feed In fact one chicken is currently
standing on his back pecking’ at a rib

Frozen in horror Christian stares unblinkingly

h CHRISTIAN
Josh

Christian’s eyes fill intensely with TEARS He starts toward
Simon whose lung-wings are subtly SWELLING and DEFLATING
He’s still breathing

Driven by morbid compulsion Christian crouches under Simon
to make sure that it’s Simon’s face and he confirms that it
is BUT

His EYES HAVE BEEN REMOVED and the sockets have been stuffed
with BRILLIANTLY COLORED FLOWERS

Terrified Christian turns - as if to run from this nightmare
but he SLAMS into

ODD who is wearing a garland crown Odd blows a handful of
BROWN POWDER in Christian’s face Christian can’t help but
BREATHE IT IN He coughs out a lungful of the mysterious

dust

Stunned for a moment Christian stumbles back He tries to
move his legs but they are suddenly FROZEN Now immobile
Christian drunkenly COLLAPSES He writhes into panic unable
to move His eyes are LOCKED OPEN

He sees a gathering of Hargans outside the door among them
is PELLE Christian looks pleadingly at Pelle Pelle looks
away with shame

Odd leans down With his fingers he CLOSES one of
Christian’s EYELIDS He then CLOSES the other As this lid
shuts we GO TO BLACK

grossly distended pile of blossoming flowers Her GIANT
FLORAL GARLAND CROWN is comprised of the nine special flowers

upright (Also RUBEN has a special seat whose platform is
covered in COTTON resembling CLOUDS)

stand upright and their bottom halves (legs hips) have been
replaced by TREE STUMPS and their arms have been replaced by
dense TREE BRANCHES Their branch-arms are positioned to
strike symbolic poses The female’s head is tilted back as
GNARLED TWIGS jut violently from her mouth (as if they grew

pong balls) with a different RUNIC NAME carved into each

The Man rotates the ball cage which then dispenses a single
BALL The man holds up the ball and reads the name aloud

at the sight of Dani

Dani’s EYES settle fixedly on CHRISTIAN A wave of intense
EMOTION eee animates Dani’s face Sadness anger love
heartbreak ese feelings are finally wrestled down and
her expression npecomes BLANK again Her EYES still trained
on Christian have HARDENED They narrow pointedly to suggest
that she’s made her decision Sten understands

sacred offering

Christian’s muffled screams now become hysterical He has
turned blue in the face Dani’s gaze remains steely and
absent

EXT FIELD - EVENING 114

CU of a WHEEL rolling across the grass Tracking alongside
this we tilt up to reveal that it belongs to a WHEELBARROW
Lying in the wheelbarrow is CONNIE’S CORPSE Itis soaking wet
and its flesh is grossly distended (from being left
underwater) She is wearing the same outfit (of greenery and
jewels) that was used earlier for the sacrificia tree (which
was fed to the lake)

Continuing to track alongside the wheelbarrow (which is

pushed by a young male Hargan) we pull back to EXPAND OUR

VIEW We reveal that the Hargan is carting Connie’s corpse

toward the yellow-painted TRIANGULAR TEMPLE which was

previousty off-limits It stands in the center of an open
ield Its door is now OPEN

We settle on a static wide of this until a NEW CART is pushed
into frame We now follow this cart keeping it centered in
frame This cart holds MARK’S “CORPSE In fact it is just
his hollowed out SKIN - stuffed with straw and hay Atop his
head is a jester’s hat

Peripherally other bodies are being carted toward the house

We continue to track ahead following Mark’s cart INTO the
SACRED HOUSE

INT SACRED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 115

The interior is completely adorned in greenery An impossibly
lush mausoleum In the center is a PLATFORM made of hay

Connie’s corpse is rested against one wall
Mark’s is seated against the opposite wall

Beyond them to either side are the TWO ELDER TREE-CORPSES
that were standing upright in the crowd The male body is
surrounded by his most precious belongings (jewelry books
etc) The dead female elder is also surrounded by her most
prized possessions

Beyond them at the far end of the temple is

JOSHS BODY which is covered in dirt and soil His eyes and
nostrils are clogged with earth His face is locked into a
gagged scream his mouth utterly stuffed with paper (from the
Rubi Radr) Stacks of books rest on his lap (and atop those
his smartphone stands on its side facing outward) And
beside Josh

SIMON’S CORPSE He is now in the same dress as the rest of
the corpses but the eyes are still replaced by bright
flowers

EXT BOOKBINDING HOUSE - SAME TIME 116

We are PUSHING TOWARD the bookbinding house whose doors are
open To the side of it Ulf and Ingemar are being embraced
passionately by several members of the community

INT BOOK-BINDING ROOM - SAME TIME 117

A room that is typically used for book-binding Its walls are
lined with collector’s editions of books

A DEAD BEAR (seen earlier alive and caged) lies on the island
table A deep INCISION has been drawn from the animal’s neck to
its groin Two Hargan Labourers pull out the bear’s INNARDS
After scooping out the majority of its guts they pile the
waste into a bucket

Then with the assistance of two well-built Hargan men the
Labourers endeavor to lift CHRISTIAN’s paralyzed body

Christian is fitted into the bear’s hollowed out carcass
They start by inserting his limp legs into the bear’s legs

INT SACRED HOUSE - MINUTES LATER 118
Humming and music has started very quietly outside

Christian has been secured into the giant bear carcass The
incision (from its groin to its neck) has been SEWN UP The
bear’s JAW has been removed creating a gaping HOLE (down to
its upper chest) through which Christian’s FACE is visible

Five Hargan labourers plant the bear carcass in the CENTER of
the hay platform Its back rests against a hay pile Christian
is still unable to move or speak His muffled screams persist

A man dressed as “Vidorr” (god of vengeance) stands before
Christian He holds the Rubi Radr in his hands

VIDORR
(in Swedish)
Mighty and dreadful beast With
you we purge our most unholy
Affekts We banish you now to the
deepest recesses where you may
reflect on your wickedness

Ingemar and Ulf are now seated on haystacks They are also
surrounded by their most prized belongings Mats stands
before Ingemar who smiles widely He pours a thick sappy
LIQUID into Ingemar’s mouth

MATS
(in Swedish)
Drink from the yew tree Feel no
fear

Mats moves to Ulf He pours the liquid into his mouth as
well

Mats leaves the house Now THREE HARGAN MEN enter with
FLAMING TORCHES The music begins to rise outside including
the wordless microtonal SINGING we’ve come to recognize

The men approach Christian whose “screaming” has become
horribly frenzied

The men move to different sides of the hay platform They

form a TRIANGLE Simultaneously they touch their torches to

the hay - igniting a FIRE

EXT FIELD - SAME TIME 119

The torch-men exit the house Inside the fire has begun to
spread along the platform

The music rises as the fire picks up The SINGING which
wavers in trembling anticipation has not yet found harmony

Dani watches this with dissociated eyes She stands tensely

in the field eyes locked on the fire Behind her all of

Harga is enraptured

INT SACRED HOUSE - SAME TIME 120

The fire has grown considerabl Inside the bear Christian
is now being steam-boiled in t é animal’s fluids

The bear’s FUR begins to catch fire Before long the whole
animal is swallowed in the blaze Christian’s wretched face
becomes invisible behind the flames

Ulf and Ingemar (still smiling) watch this with detached
fascination

The fire has now spread to other piles of hay It has begun
to crawl up the walls of the house

Ulf is suddenly consumed by flames He SCREAMS

EXT FIELD - SAME TIME 121

Ulf’s screams are heard from the Sacred House Suddenly every
member of the Hargan community (who is not singing) begins to
SCREAM as well Feeling Ulf’s pain they emit a horrible chorus
of wails When Ul1f’s screams die down so do theirs

Meanwhile Ruben has been given paper to PAINT on Two elders
encourage him

DANI watching the burning house with fraught eyes is
suddenly met with a wave of conflicting emotions Her
expression curdles into one of sheer HORROR and DISGUST Then
it becomes one of deep SORROW and SHAME Her eyes well with
tears The singing has now HARMONIZED and has risen to an
insane operatic pitch

We cut to an immense WIDE Dani’s back is in the fg and the
burning house is in the bg Overcome Dani buries her face in
her hands Breaking into gentle sobs she begins to walk
aimlessly to the side We TRACK alongside her keeping her
centered She is circling the house pulling at her hair and
face in increasing anguish She is WEEPING now and the house
ever present in the bg) has become ENGULFED in the raging
ames

Dani begins MOANING and SCREAMING Her howls almost harmonize
with the singing in the bg The fire ROARS and CRACKLES in
the distance It’s apocalyptic

SALMON Revisions 115

Soon it’s uncertain whether Dani is crying or LAUGHING Her
legs become weak and she collapses to her knees Four Hargans
(one of them being Pelle) run into the scene carrying a
LARGE CHAIR - Dani’s throne

The Hargans lift Dani by the arms and SEAT her in the throne
They then HOIST the chair into the air

On the upward LIFT we cut to a tight CLOSE-UP of Danis
face She is being carried forward Her expression which
begins as one of great distress slowly starts to TURN Her
agony subsides into sudden CONFUSION What’s happening
ere am I I’m on this chair being carried Her expression

goes from FEAR to EXCITEMENT to CONFUSION again She

suddenly lets out an abrupt LAUGH (which we can’t hear over
the music and the now-deafening FIRE) Dani is now being
taken over by an invading sense of pride and contentment
This soon evolves into a manic exhilaration Dani BEAMS She
has been embraced by a new family She is Queen She is not
alone

A SMILE Finally breaks onto Dani’s face (For some this smile
might recall the photo of Dani in her parent’s bedroom at the
only bye of the film) She has surrendered to a joy known
only by the insane She has lost herself completely and she
inally free It is horrible and it is beautifu
