and its a story that might bore you but
you dont have to listen because I always
knew it was going to be like that and it
was I think in that last year or
actually weekend really a Friday in
September at Camden and this was years
ago when I was a different person and I
was so drunk that I ended up losing my
virginity

A WIDE SHOT of Windham House dorm filled shoulder-to-
shoulder with PARTY-GOERS from ALL WALKS OF COLLEGE LIFE
There is a DRONING WAH-WAH of PEOPLE TALKING and drinking
beer Breaking through it is a SYNTHESIZED TOMANDANDY POP
SONG On a makeshift dancefloor a guy named STUART has taken
off his shirt and is performing a wild solo dance

SUPERIMPOSE THE TITLE
THE END OF THE WORLD PARTY
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM

LAUREN is trying to be inconspicuous despite how shitfaced
drunk she is -- using the walls gravitational pull to keep
her from swaying and revealing her inebriated state She
lifts a big red plastic cup (the kind you buy by the hundreds
at Price Club) to her lips and takes another sip of beer

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
---I lost it to some guy who I thought
was a Ceramics major but was actually
either an NYU film student just up to
Camden for the End of the World

Across the room the GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT is
talking with expressionistic hand gestures to A TOWNIE
LOOKING GUY wearing a Hawaiian style shirt with an odd donkey
pattern on it

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
-or a townie
(pause)
I actually had my eye on someone else
that night

SWISH PAN and TRACK IN ON VICTOR a Senior with a good body

and is so beautiful he might be gay Hes talking with some
OTHER POPULAR GUY

(CONTTNUED )

The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 3

VICTOR

I’m telling you with European girls it’s
just a numbers game If you stand ona
street corner of any major European city
and consecutively ask every girl you see
if she’1ll fuck you one out of twenty
will say yes -- right then and there

(as if to illustrate)
Do you wanna fuck Do you wanna fuck
Do you wanna fuck--

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing over Victor’s
illustration)
Victor A Junior a Drama major just
back from Europe only a little gay with
jet black hair a great body and these
amazing gray eyes

VICTOR

(continuing)
--Do you wanna fuck Do you wanna fuck
Do you wanna fuck Do you wanna fuck
Do you wanna fuck One out of
twentybam You’re fucking It’s a
confirmed statistic That’s the
difference between American and European
girls

Victor lift his eyes with a smile to nod to someone across
the room

SWISH PAN and TRACK IN ON A BEAUTIFUL FRENCH GIRL across the
room catches his whats-up nod and she smiles back in that
seductive way that can only mean they fuck on a regular
basis

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
---but Victor was seeing this beautiful
French girl who he had met earlier in the
year while backpacking through Paris

HARD CUT TO
EXT PARIS STREET - DAY
Victor is walking down a Paris street with a large backpack
on and eating a pathetic emporter Camembert cheese sandwich

He stops the beautiful French girl and asks her directions
from a little Plan du Paris

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
She had given him mono just after she
gave him directions

CUT BACK TO

INT WINDHAM HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON The guy who might be a Ceramics major but
probably is an NYU film student is sitting on a ratty old
couch covered with a pale blue sheet talking to her about
movies but really trying to jump into her pants

GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT
So you know the movie Im talking about
It was unfairly labeled a Tarantino film
even though he’s only listed as an
Executive Producer Remember the sex
scene with Nosferatu on the TV in the
background Mindfuck if ever there was
one

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
So this guy from NYU or wherever who
wasn’t even a good Victor facsimile

QUICK PANTRACK IN ON Lauren trying to keep focus and
nodding as if she knows (but doesnt) what he’s talking
about is sitting opposite from him on the couch

LAUREN
(nodding)
Yeah Yeah

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
---and I were talking on this ratty old
couch underneath and I remember this--

QUICK TILT TO REVEAL A poster of a giant smiling Ronald
Reagan that someone has drawn a Hitler moustache on is hung
on the wall directly above and between them

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
--a big poster of Ronald Reagan that
someone had drawn a Hitler moustache on
-- maybe it was a Charlie Chaplin
moustache JI dunno

The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 5

WIDE ON Lauren and the possible Ceramics major but probable
NYU Film major Hes CHATTING HER UP and shes kind of
nodding in agreement and sipping her beer -- occasionally
BLURTING OUT SOME INANE COMMENT

LAUREN (VO)

(continuing)
---and I kept agreeing with his likes and
dislikes all the time thinking that while
he might not be Victor he was cute
enough and I was sure that I was
Mmispronouncing all these filmmakers’
names remembering all the wrong actors
naming the wrong cinematographers but I
wanted him

His eyeline wanders and focuses on someone else across the
room

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
---and I could see that his gaze was
drifting toward Kristin Notneff

SWISH PAN AND TRACK IN ON The Louise Brooks-looking KRISTIN
NOTNEFF who turns her eyes from WHATEVER CONVERSATION SHES
IN to meet the eyes of the guy who may be an NYU student
Smile

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
---and she was looking back at him with
confidence because she knew that
underneath her clothes she was wearing a
black bra and black panties -- complete
with garter belt -- which I wasnt

CLOSE ON Lauren knowing that if she wants this guy who
might be an NYU Film major shes going to have to make a
move or else the garter belt girl is going to steal him
away

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
But I had the next best thing
Lauren leans in and WHISPERS into the guys ear
LAUREN
(whispering)
Ive got a joint in my room

QUICK CUT TO
The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 6

INT WINDHAM HOUSE - LORNA SLAVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT
SLAM The guy who may be from NYU shuts the door and smiles

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
Except it wasnt my room It was Lorna
Slavins room who was off campus at her
boyfriends houseprobably swallowing
his DNA

Lauren sits down on the bed totally fucked up but seductive
despite her condition

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
And I didnt have a joint either -- and
if I did I didnt know where it was
because it would have been Lorna Slavins
joint He didnt really even care when I
told him I didnt have one

The guy who might be from NYU sits down on the bed next to
her and makes his move He leans in and starts kissing her
Almost immediately her eyes roll into the back of her head
and she passes out

CUT TO BLACK

LAUREN (0S)
(continuing)
I must have passed out around then

FADE IN
INT WINDHAM HOUSE - LORNA SLAVIN’S ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE ON Lauren looking kind of wasted Shes
laying on her stomach and her face is buried into a pillow

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
When I came to I tried to take off my
bra but was still too drunkand he was
already fucking me

She looks back kind of annoyed and sure enough shes being
fucked from behind GRUNT GRUNT GRUNT -- with every
exhalation comes a thrust She starts MOANING with every
plunge into her

(CONTTNUED )
The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 7

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)

But he didnt know I was a virgin and
that it hurt -- not that badly only a
little bit of sharp pain but not as bad
as I had been taught to expect but not
exactly pleasant either -- and thats
when I heard another voice in the room

She lifts her head and tries to look back behind her to
determine the source of the VOICE

GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT (0S)
Do her how Ron Jeremy would

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
---and I remember the weight on the bed
shifting and realizing that this person
behind me wasnt the NYU film student
guy but someone else--

TRACK UP FROM Lauren to a TOWNIE is grasping her ass and
fucking her from behind with porn movie thrusts He has a
blue Viagra pill on his tongue and is holding a plastic beer
cup in one hand He swallows the pill with a swig of beer

TOWNIE
Leave that up to Vitamin “V”

LAUREN (VO)
(continuing)
Ohmygod it was some townie I had
actually lost my virginity to a townie

TRACK BACK DOWN TO Lauren as she lays her drunken head back
onto the pillow and shuts her eyes trying to block out the
thrusting

LONG SLOW ZOOM IN ON her closed eyes

LAUREN (VO)

(continuing)
This wouldnt have happened with Victor
He would have taken me gently in his big
strong Drama major arms and undressed me
quietly expertly taken the bra off with
grace and ease kissed me deeply
tenderly and it probably wouldnt have
hurt I should have given myself to
Victor last term when I had the chance--

The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 8

Suddenly the door opens up and light floods the room --
Laurens eyes open up

SOME GUYS ROLLING A KEG whore bathed in a silhouette push
the keg into the room

GUY ROLLING A KEG
Dude we have to put the keg somewhere

It rolls forward and SLAMS into the bed shaking her

The door closes again and the room is again shrouded in
darkness

GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT (0S)
Im next

Suddenly mid-thrust the townie heaves up a mouthful of
barf spraying it onto Laurens back with a satisfying
SPLASH

The disruption causes all three people Lauren included to
slip and fall off the bed pulling the sheets with them and
CRASHING into a desk or something

GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT
Gross dude Leave me with sloppy
seconds why don’t you

The townie lurches forward and grabs a cheap wicker waste
basket the kind you buy at Target and lets round two come
gushing out into it Of course it splashes out and
splatters onto Lauren and the guy who might be an NYU film
student

For a moment she focuses on the townies shirt its a short
sleeved button-down with a cartoony donkey pattern printed on
it

Lauren shuts her eyes

FREEZE FRAME Lauren sits there locked in time a wretched
moment thats almost humble in its horrible nature

THEN WE READ THE TITLE
LAUREN

She has just won the Gold Medal for the most pathetic loss of
virginity of all time

(CONTTNUED )
The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 9

LAUREN (VO)
(sardonic)
I always knew it would be like this

Suddenly

Lauren the possible NYU Film major and the townie all start
to MOVE IN

REVERSE

They are winding BACKWARDS as if time itself were flowing in
the opposite direction

GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT
(talking backwards)
uoy t’nod yhw sdnoces yppols htiw em
evaeL edud ssorG

The barf seems to get sucked out of the basket and back into
the townies mouth They all tumble and slip BACKWARDS up and
onto the bed He sucks the vomit off of her back through the
air and into his mouth until shes clean again

TRACK SLOWLY AWAY AND OUT OF THE ROOM as Lauren finds herself
back on her face and knees getting it from behind but with
strange REVERSE thrusts

GUY WHO MIGHT BE AN NYU FILM STUDENT
(his voice running backwards)
---txen mI
Around now we notice that the SOUND IS FLOWING BACKWARDS as
well The tomandandy song can be heard MUFFLED THROUGH THE
FLOOR -- yik-yakking as it is WOUND BACKWARDS
The townies GRUNTS HAVE REVERSED into a SUCKING SOUND
The door flings open and floods the trio in light suddenly
the keg rolls backwards back through the door and into the
hands of the guys who rolled it in
GUY ROLLING A KEG
(his voice running backwards)
-erehwemos gek eht tup to evah ew eduD
TRACK BACKWARDS (IN REVERSE) and OUT THE DOOR INTO
THE HALLWAY (REVERSE)
The dorm room door is swung closed even though it is really

being opened

(CONTTNUED )

The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 10

The guys rolling the keg are WALKING BACKWARDS down the hall
because they of course are REVERSING through time They
kind of pull the keg BACKWARDS with what seem like gentle
braking of the rolling keg with their fingertips

Theyre laughing and the MUSIC which we can now hear clearly
is still WINDING BACKWARDS

They come to some stairs and with an erratic BACKWARDS
MOVEMENT the keg jumps up into the air and into the hands of
the guys who carry it BACKWARDS down the stairs

INT WINDHAM HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (REVERSE) - NIGHT

The guys with the keg come walking down the stairs -- all
other motion is still in reverse and so is the music

TRACK BACKWARDS (IN REVERSE MOTION) through the room
following them with the keg as they roll it BACKWARDS across
the small dance floor where COLLEGE STUDENTS are dancing (in
REVERSE of course)

The keg rolls up to a bucket of watery melted ice The guys
rolling it hoist it up and out of a bucket of ice The tap
pops on and the last dribbles of foamy spray suck back into
the spoutall REVERSE MOTION

THE WATERY ICE (REVERSE)

in the bucket suddenly begins to form and crystallize into
hundreds and hundreds of cubes The water literally vanishes
as it REFORMS INTO BAG ICE at its coldest

INT WINDHAM HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - (REVERSE) - EARLIER

CLOSE ON The beer flows out of cups and into the spout
The keg must be full

TRACK BACKWARDS past a GUY WITH A LARGE BEER BONG He lifts
it up and it’s as if the beer comes flowing out of his mouth --
filling up the long tube

TRACK BACKWARDS past a GUY WATCHING THE BEER BONGER with a
bag of chips he’s pulling them out of his mouth and putting
them into the bag

TRACK BACKWARDS past a beat up Sean Bateman (who I’1l1
describe later) Some ripped apart purple envelopes and
their accompanying letters come lifting up and out of a
beercup-filled trashcan and into his hand He REVERSE RIPS
them back together and walks backwards out of the front door
and out of the room

(CONTTNUED )

The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 11

TRACK BACKWARDS past Stuart his insane solo dance even more
insane in REVERSE

CONTINUE TRACKING past Lauren who drunkenly gets up with the
guy who might be an NYU film major and wobbly leads him
upstairsand I’ll bet you a hundred dollars that she takes
him to Lorna Slavin’s room -- except it happens in REVERSE
so she comes down from the stairs instead of up them

PULL BACK TO REVEAL The entire room We can see Victor
who’s smiling as he watches the beautiful French girl walk
backwards as she REVERSE APPROACHES him We can also see
Kristin Notneff scoping around for someone other than the guy
who might be an NYU student

TRACK in-between a GROUP OF GUYS near a fireplace with a TV
in it instead of wood On the TV is a video of an actual
fireplace PAUL DENTON one of the guys is talking He’s
definitely one of the beautiful people At 20 he has the
brooding good looks of a supermodel but is clearly too sharp
to settle for that He’s voracious in his hunger to stay
hungryyet Descartian enough to question what it means to
hunger

SHOT of Paul and his friends DONALD RAYMOND HARRY and A
COUPLE OF OTHERS

PAUL

forward momentum You know Like things

looks away and starts talking to the girl

Whoa I think its kicking in

Paul looks inward for a moment wondering if his perception
has changed

PAUL (VO)
I couldnt detect whether the E had
altered my perception yet I did feel
kind of horny But was that the drug or
me Then I got to wondering what is
me Is a person just a collection of
their likes and dislikes Will I always
be the quintessential faggot Will I
always only pant after the blond-tan-good-
body-stupid-goons Will I always blow it
with the smart caring sensitive type
I want to stop but

Paul gets up and lays down on the bed next to the handsome
dunce

PAUL
I’m feeling it now too
PAUL (VO)
(continuing)

He leans in and kisses the handsome dunce full and wet on
the lips

The handsome dunce responds by violently pushing Paul off the
bed Paul falls to the floor with a THUMP The dunce then

UP with them as they fly up into the hands of

SEAN BATEMAN young and good looking with crystal blue eyes
unkempt hair and an ice-cold demeanor that suggests he has
long since lost his innocence Hes one of those guys who
has washboard abs without ever having to do crunches (I hate
people like that) But for all of his physical attributes
and material wealth he seems strangely empty vacant and
distant He has a clean shiner on his left eye and his lip
is slightly swollen as if he had just been in a fight

He REVERSE rips the purple letter fragments together
reuniting them into a small handful of purple letters And
then--

SWITCH THE DIRECTION OF TIME 18

Sean re-rips up the letters and throws them into the trash
can He picks up a bottle of Jack Daniels to his lips and
finishes the last of it

From Sean’s POV we see Lauren walking upstairs with the guy

walking off with the handsome dunce Sean takes another long
pull from the bottle of Jack Daniels After swallowing the
harsh gulp he diverts his eyes and scans the room

SEAN (VO)

(narrating)
A great numb feeling washes over me as I
let go of the past and look forward to
the future I pretend to be a vampire --
and I don’t really need to pretend
because it’s who I am An emotional
vampire I’ve just come to expect it
That vampires are real That I was born
this way That I feed off of other
people’s real emotions I search for

(continuing)
She had no panties on and had the body
of a much younger girl Her breasts were
small but full yet the nipples weren’t
hard not even after he touched them
then kissed and licked them She smelled
like sweet fruit Her snatch was small
too -- the pubic hair light and sparse
Yet when he fingered her he didn’t feel
anything She wasn’t getting wet even
though she was making soft little moans

FADE IN
EXT CAMDEN - COMMONS - MONTAGE - VARIOUS

Camden is a small Liberal Arts college somewhere in New
England It is Winter and there is snow blanketing the
ground STUDENTS are mulling about making their way to and
from classexcept something is odd--

IN A SERIES OF SHOTS we discover what’s odd about the
scene

All of the STUDENTS are walking BACKWARDS We are once
again again MOVING IN REVERSE

Instead of leaving tracks behind in the snow the STUDENTS’
tracks seem to vanish under their feet

The STUDENTS exhale tiny clouds of condensation into their
mouths

Masses of students flow in rapid backwards streams across the
campus

The snow begins to rise in little flakes up from the ground
FALLING UPWARDS IN REVERSE into the sky

The clouds suck away backwards and the sun and moon begin to
rapidly travel backwards across the sky setting where they
rise and rising where they set Sunset gives into sunrise
over and over again until

The ground is left bare and covered with golden leaves which
eventually jump up off of the ground and onto the ends of
tree branches

More days pass -- weeks -- monthsall in REWIND

The dry auburn leaves gradually ripen and turn green The
trees slowly become full and thick with leaves

The activity on the campus’ lawns bristles to life with
PEOPLE RIDING BICYCLES BACKWARDS and STUDENTS THROWING
FRISBEES BACKWARDS It’s a buzzing of activity throughout
the school year forever REWINDING until we reach

The beginning of the year

FADE TO BLACK

The FOOD SERVICE GIRL who served him who is probably a
financial aid student gives him a polite and all-too-fresh
smile She might be cute but we wouldn’t know because she’s
dressed in full food service regalia white hat apron
plastic gloves -- which kind of sucks any potential
attraction out of you

Sean regards her with the same lack of enthusiasm he has for
his breakfast Then after popping a mocking cynically
polite and all-too-fresh smile back at her he extinguishes
his cigarette into the eggs and walks the tray directly to a
garbage can and dumps it He then makes a bee-line for the
coffee

INT DINING HALL - MORNING

The dining hall is moderately full of STUDENTS collected
into table sized cliques eating or not eating breakfast
The NEXT THREE SCENES ARE ALL SHOT SIMULTANEOUSLY and woven
together editorially

places the fork down No eggs will be eaten this morning
Paul glances across the dining hall at another table where a

LAUREN

walks up to a table from the soda dispensers having just
filled a large Styrofoam cup with Diet Coke From the
background we see Sean and Paul taking seats at their
respective tables

LAUREN
Where’s Sari

Sitting at the table are a PACK OF GIRLS LARA is an extreme
version of Lauren Lara smokes more poses more talks more
and wears more black CLAUDIA comes from money and it
shows TORI is thin with long hair -- a young Morticia

LARA
Sari’s pregnant

LAUREN
(pulling up a chair)
No shit You’re kidding Tell me about
it

LARA
What’s to tell Claudia’s been talking
to her all morning

CLAUDIA
I gave her some Darvon and a Prozac
Told her to go to psychological
Counseling

LAUREN
No way What’s she doing about it I
mean -- when

CLAUDIA
She’s having it done next week
Wednesday

LARA
Then she’s dropping out and going to
Europe I guess

LAUREN
Maybe I should go to Europe Find
Victor Finally lose my virginity

CLAUDIA
Wait I’m totally confused Didn’t you
lose it to Victor last term

Lauren pauses mulling it over

LAUREN
Notexactly I mean you’re still a
virgin if you only do blowjobs and anal
right

They all nod “yes” in unison Lauren smiles relieved

LAUREN
Whew Then I’m still a virgin
(explaining further)
I wasn’t sure about Victor at the time --
but now I’m positive that he’s the one
So I’m going to save myself until he gets

back
TORI
(applying lipstick)
Pffff
LAUREN
What
TORI

That’s what you said about Paul And
then look what happened

LAUREN
How was I supposed to know he would go
gay on me

CLAUDIA
Tori has a point Lauren You do have a
track record of dating boys who go the

gay way

LAUREN
So what are you saying

CLAUDIA
Nothing But maybe it’s a defense
mechanism you’ve developed

LAUREN
Defense against what

LARA
(being frank)
Losing it Leaving childhood behind
(to the others)
She actually looks through a book of
genital diseases every Friday night to
deter herself from having sex

(CONTTNUED )
The Rules of Attraction wwwavarycom 37

38 LAUREN
Excuse me but you can hardly quantify
the situation that way I have carnal
knowledge with boys all the time Just
because it’s not vaginal--

LARA
Don’t take it the wrong way We’re your
friends--

CLAUDIA

Yeah We’re trying to help you

LARA
It’s just that what boys want is pussy
They just love it They spent nine
months getting out and the rest of their
lives trying to get back in If they
want a blowjob or backdoor they dont need
to come to us

TORI
Everyone knows that a guy knows how to
suck dick and take it up the ass better
than a girl

CLAUDIA
(adding to the thought)
Just like how girls know how to treat
pussy better than boys

LARA
It’s a simple equation If you want to
keep a guy you have to make him feel like
he’s getting something he can’t get from
another guy

LAUREN
(realization)
Fuuuuhhhhhck What have I been doing

LARA
(to the others)
She gets it

LAUREN
So what do I do

LARA
Look we’re not telling you to lose it to
the next Brady that comes along But you
need to gain some experience before
Victor gets back

a grup teacher to our room

LAUREN

He can come by anytime

LARA
Let go of my arm Lauren he’s married

LAUREN

CLAUDIA
He’1ll never leave his wife for you It
would screw up his tenure review The
most he wants is a blowjob

consider him Kill two birds with one
stone Lose your virginity and raise
your GPA

DISSOLVE TO
INT CAMDEN - COMMONS - POST OFFICE - DAY 39

SEAN enters the Post Office A FEW OTHER STUDENTS mill about
writing letters while standing buying stamps CHATTING
Sean heads towards the student mailboxes

Sean opens his box and pulls several letters out Mostly
junk and fliers to clubs Nothing personal except A fancy
purple envelope with a simple hand-drawn heart around the
hand-typed name “Sean Bateman” All the other mail gets
thrown into a large trashcan

Sean looks around the room to see if anyone is watching him
Anybody could have dropped this note in his box There’s a
COUPLE KISSING near the window Lauren is walking down the
hall past the post office Paul and the dumb blond kid from
LA are playing Frisbee golf nearby But no one is looking
at him

Sean lifts the purple letter to his nose almost as if by
compulsion and smells it -- it’s scented He shuts his
eyes

He then eagerly opens it and as he pulls the lavender letter
out from inside glitter falls from the letter and onto his
sweater Instead of being upset Sean is pleasantly
surprised and delighted

SEAN
(with admiration)
You sneaky bitch

He brushes as much of the glitter from his sweater as
possible and then reads the letter

how you feel I want to moan and writhe
with you and I want to go up to you and
kiss your mouth and pull you to me and
say ‘love you love you love you love you’
while stripping -- while sex commences
I want you so bad it stings I want to
kill the ugly girls that you’re always
with Do you really like those boring
naive coy calculating girls or is it
just for sex The seeds of love have
taken hold and if we won’t burn together
I’1l burn alone”

lines of coke have been scraped and drawn from a rock of
cocaine the size of a coffee mug

Sean walks in through the front door

Sean walks over to the stereo and turns down the volume

Rupert jumps up pumped from doing push-ups and walks
quickly into Sean’s space He smiles an evil smile

The white trash girl doesn’t even notice (in fact she
doesn’t notice anything throughout the entire scenejust
watches MTV)

positive pressure to rip your carpals
free from your metacarpals and you’1l be

I’m not your enemyRupertand I don’t
have a weapon--

Rupert releases his hand and lets him fall to the ground

RUPERT
That’s why you get a little time homes

He walks over to the mirror and wipes it with his finger and
then rubs his gums He then turns and sits in a large ratty
Easyboy recliner

RUPERT
You want some coke

He waves to the rock of cocaine the size of the coffee mug on

kind of walk that when you see it coming toward you you
cross the street to avoid it His hand gestures are no less
extreme and horrific

shitload of fuckin’ cash that’s what I
fuckin’ think you rich motherfuckin’

that the veins on his forehead might just explode Then he
sharply bends over and picks up the gun from the table

in the air and freezes

HARD CUT TO
INT BOOTH HOUSE - JUNKIE NAMED MARC’S ROOM - DAY 44

The curtains are drawn in the dorm room of a JUNKIE NAMED
MARC which cast the entire space in a shady chiaroscuro
Marc the junkie is excitedly wrapping his arm and preparing
to shoot up

JUNKIE NAMED MARC
Time isn’t a constantthat’s for damn

toadjust the flow oftimeto suit

Now I should interject at this point this kid doesn’t look
like a junkie -- he actually looks pretty healthy He’s lean
and athletic looking -- like a sprinter But the fact of the
matter is that he’s gone over the deep end with usage and his
brain is fried

Sean is sitting there watching this blubbering mess of a
person fumble distractedly with his gear

JUNKIE NAMED MARC
(licking his lips and
continuing)
So you seedon’t be a slaveto time--

He removes the needle from his arm and feels the rush of
cocaine enter his system

were cool I guess Lots of Van Goghs and the Vermeers were
intense Wandered around bought a lot of pastries ate some
intense waffles The Dutch all know English so I didnt have
to speak any Dutch which was a relief Wanted to rent a car
but couldnt The people I was staying with had bikes
though so I went biking one day and I saw a lot of cows and
geese and canals I pulled off to the side of the road got
stoned and fell asleep woke up wrote a little took some
acid made a few drawings and then went to the red light
district in Den Haag because I heard the whores are cleaner
and better looking than the whores in Amsterdam -- which they
were I fucked one so hard that I skinned my knees Ate
lunch at a Burger King which was better and no more
expensive than the States Stayed in the Amsterdam Youth
Hostel where there were some cool German guys who spoke
better English than I do We bought some coke and I cruised
the red light district until I found a brunette with big tits
that reminds me of KJ I gave her a hundred Guilders She
worked me up mounted me put on a good show and in the end
she pulled me out and I came between her tits -- even though
I’m wearing a rubber Afterward we made small talk about
AIDS her Moroccan pimp and herself I wake to the sound of
a wino singing It is eight AM and hot as blazes Had a
beer and then headed South to Paris Climbed the Eifel Tower
with this Canadian guy named Tim for only seven Francs
because the ticket machine was broke Got the hang of the

going to Camden I think she gave me mono Went to Pamplona

almost got trampled by the crowd Dropped acid at the Museo
Gala-Dali which was a trip Went to the lamest circus ever
a goat and two guys on unicycles Went to Nice and ate
Mexican food at a place called Calexico -- or Mexicali Then
went to Switzerland where I ironically couldn’t find anyone
who had the time Took the Glacier Express to Zermatt the
Matterhorn and found out that I could ski it which when
you’re there you have to do -- but I didn’t have gloves so I
used socks instead and froze my hands It was slushy but

with sour milk Eurail Pass’d into Italy and accidently
slept through Florence Ended up in Rome which was big and
hot and dirty It was just like LA but with ruins I
went to the Vatican but couldn’t get in because I was wearing
shorts I could get into the Sistine Chapel which now that
it’s been cleaned looked fake At the train station I met

make out She calls me Mr LA I come close to fucking her
but she says she can’t because she’s engaged which is
bullshit I leave the next morning before they get up and
take the ferry back to Italy On the train I meet some Dutch
guys We started drinking heavily The Dutch guys seem like
fags to me I got so drunk I couldn’t see and exchanged my
shirt with one of them In Venice I try to fart and instead
shit my pants Back in my hotel I masturbate and have a pain
in my groin That night I dream about a beautiful girl half
in water stretching her lean body She asks me if I like it
and I tell her she could clean fish with it I wake well
rested masturbate in shower and check out I make my way
back to London and hang out in Piccadilly Circus at a comic
book shop I meet a cute girl from Amsterdam at a Whimpys
while eating a Spicy Bean Burger She’s an Oreo with a
