A BEAUTIFUL AERIAL SHOT OF RIO DE JANEIRO — ESTABLISHING 1

The “Marvelous City” looks like something out of a dream
Ipanema Copacabana Sugarloaf Mountain Fey places
on Earth are as beautiful

SUPER Rio de Janeiro Brazil

Now PUSH IN past the postcard view of paradise down into
the dark underbelly of Rio where we FIND a CAR arriving in
the city CLOSER it’s a ‘72 NISSAN SKYLINE The vehicle is
beaten to shit Clearly run hard and on its last legs

SERIES OF SHORT IMPRESSIONISTIC SHOTS -— OVER CREDITS 2

- INT SKYLINE BRIAN is riving MIA dozes next to him
head against the window They look nothing like we remember
them Their clothes are dirty Torn Their faces tired

Worn with worry Exhausted Life on the run has been hard

Brian checks the rearview with concern Sees a POLICE CAR
coming up behind them Tenses Mia rouses notices too
Nexrvously they both hold their breath
sand only when the cop car continues on past do they relax
- The shots continue Brian and Mia’s car passing through
some of the darkest roughest neighborhoods in all of South
America Young gangs roam the streets Watch the Skyline
driving by
The threat is palpable
Eventually they arrive at the base of a favela (shantytown)
The roads are too narrow for a vehicle so fey have to leave
the Skyline and continue on foot up the hillside
BRIAN

Looks like we’re walking
- Brian and Mia walk up through the favela‘s winding maze
like paths The poverty here is incredible No running
water No electricity Homes made from scavenged materials

MIA

Brian just keeps walking

closer

Vince turns as a FAMILIAR CAR pulls up before him Though
it’s no longer the glossy black demon we remember -- its
distinctive supercharger GONE and the black paint now PRIMER

Dodge CHARGER

Sunlight streams into the freight car revealing Brian and

REVERSE ANGLE - Brian and Mia stare at the muscled figures
standing on the gate in silhouette smoking torches still in

Dom gives the signal and off his cue Capa and Berto punch
the nitro winch and in the blink of an eye -- SCHUUNKK —-

ROLLS BACKWARDS OFF THE RAMP

There’s a minor explosion of smoke an dirt as the tires hit
the ground ripping past at 100 miles an hour below them The
car struggles a bitbut Vince gets it under control and
takes off heading WEST

Just then Zizi throws a silent signal to Capa who nods and
immediately makes his way toward the GT40 bom catches the
exchange Something strange Concerned he scopes a little

closer - and notices a glimpse of STEEL in the back of

Dom signals Capa and Mia’s car is YANKED off the train and
onto the Tow Truck which raises its ramp and rolls the 40
off backwards to the ground

180 degrees and heads EAST Instantly Zizi knows

“Dom streaks on a collision course with the police armada and

just as he’s about to hit them head-on --

Dom jags left and right dodging through their defensive

The vault BASHES everything out of its way Cop cars go
SPINNING away like a top BARREL-ROLLING into pieces BLASTED
ASIDE as easily as soda cans struck by a bowling ball

REYES can’t believe it watching his superior force decimated
until it’s just Reyes’ two SUV’s left -- and Dom’s car
shrieking straight at them

gun car and smash it off the bridge

But just as Reyes thinks he got away lucky --

The force of the tumbling vault YANKS Dom’s car and WHIPS it
by its cable with unbelievable force

Dom leaps out as his car slingshots away at --

see Dom dazed and bloody still sprawled on the road
struggling to rise on a leg that may be broken

Zizi marches up to Dom a roar of rage growing with every

helpless Doms face

And just as he pulls the trigger --

SFX something scrabbling through broken glass

Dom and Brian both turn to see Reyes his fine clothes
covered in blood eyes crazed with pain crawling out of the
smoking wreck

And in the distance behind him Hobbs’ Gurkha driving up to
the scene As it draws near the Gurkha stops and Hobbs and
Elena get out

Looking like a legendary gunslinger of yore he walks up the
road littered with bodies and battered cars As he nears
Reyes reaches up to him --

REYES

But as he passes Hobbs’ quick-draws his gun and double-taps

Hobbs and Elena watch as Dom and Brian walk to Brian’s car
As Brian hops in and guns the engine Dom turns back one
final timeand meets Elena’s eyes The world stops as the
two share one final’ lookThere’s a deep connection between
these two A meeting of souls

-broken only when Dom finally gets in and Brian burns them
out of there disappearing into the horizon

When theyre gone Hobbs looks at the devastation theyve
left in their wake Then at the vault

And NOTICES something STRANGE

Where the asphalt has ground away the black paint we can see

glimpses of a BLUE POWDER COATING underneath

Hobbs moves around to the vault door which is CRACKED OPEN
Looks inside to see that the vault is EMPTY Realizes this
is a duplicate

As Dom and Brian come screaming around the corner they sling

locks it in place as LEO closes the truck’s back gate to
conceal it within its belly

Without stopping Dom and Brian drive toward the DUPLICATE
VAULT Like an aircraft carrier’s winch line the hooks on
the end of their cables drag on the ground and CATCH onto the
fake vault’s straps locking on and dragging the fake vault
behind them

It all happens in the blink of an eye and when the police
come raging around the corner in pursuit they continue on
after the decoy never catching a whiff of the magic done
right before their eyes
