INT CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE

Sweat beads the forehead of a thin tired-looking recent
immigrant ENRIQUE as he delivers platters of chile rellenos
to a booth MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the bg We
HOLD on the booth where HOLLIS POGUE in his 60s entertains
two GOOD OLD BOYS--

HOLLIS
So Buddy walks up to the porch and
theres old Fishbait McHenry cleanin
the dirt out his toenails with a
pocketknife--he was the most hygienic
of all the McHenrys--

The breakfast companions are laughing already--

HOLLIS
Fishbait says Buddy in that quiet
way of his What you know about
them tires that went missing from
markets Fishbait thinks for a
minute then he lifts up a loose
board from the porch floor and calls
down into it Cmon out Pooter
they caught us

FENTON
(Laughing)
Buddy Deeds He had a way

HOLLIS
He known who it was onnacouna the
tire tracks in the dirt from the
back of the garage to where they
loaded up Old Fishbait he says
never lifted a thing in this world
if there was a way he could roll
it

More laughter--

FENTON
Wont be another like him That boy
of his doesnt come near it You ask
me hes all hat and no cattle

SAM (0S)
Fellas--

We WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth No telling how
long hes been listening Fenton is embarrassed

HOLLIS
Sam I was just telling a few about
your old man

FENTON
He was a unique individual

SAM
Yeah he was that

We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father--

HOLLIS
Big day coming up--I wish wed have
thought of it while he was still
living But he went so unexpected
FENTON
Better late than never Korean War
hero Sheriff for near thirty years--
Buddy Deeds Memorial P--

SAM
I heard there was a bit of a fuss

HOLLIS
Oh you know the usual troublemakers
Danny Padilla from the Sentinel
that crowd

FENTON
Every other damn thing in the country
is called after Martin Luther King
they cant let our side have one
measly park

HOLLIS
King wasnt Mexican Fenton--

FENTON
Bad enough all the street names are
in Spanish--

SAM
They were here first

FENTON
Then name it after Big Chief
Shitinabucket Whoever that Tonkawa
fella was He had the Mexes beat by
centuries

HOLLIS

There was a faction pulling for that
boy who was killed in the Gulf War--
Ruben--

--Santiago

HOLLIS
Right But nobody here ever noticed
him till they read his name on the
national news--

FENTON
They just wanted it to be one of
theirs--

HOLLIS
Thats not the whole story The
Mexicans that know that remember
understand what Buddy was for their
people Hell it was Mercedes over
there who swung the deciding vote
for him

Sam looks to the register where Pilars mother MERCEDES
CRUZ whacks rolls of change apart on the counter She seems
to be avoiding looking toward him

SAM
That so

HOLLIS
She put it even at three to three
so as the Mayor I get to cast the
tiebreaker The older generation
wont have any problem with it They
remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff
that it was all cause he took their
part

FENTON
Tell that one Hollis--

HOLLIS
Hell everybody heard that story a
million times

SAM
Id like to hear it Your version of
it

Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard

FENTON
Go ahead Hollis

CU HOLLIS
Hollis is hooked into it now--

HOLLIS
The two of us were the only deputies
back then me and Buddy--its what--
58--

FENTON (0S)
57 1 believe--

HOLLIS
And the Sheriff at the time was Big
Charley Wade Charley was one of
your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets
kind of Sheriffs he took a healthy
bite out of whatever moved through
this county

He looks down at the table--
HOLLIS
It was in here one night back when
Jimmy Herrera run the place Started
right here in this booth

We PAN down to the table The food has changed The tortillas
are in a straw basket instead of plastic The jukebox changes
to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly A hand with a
big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--
underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills The hand lifts
them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE
a big mean redneck with shrewd eyes It is 1957--

WADE
(Grins)
This beaner fare doesnt agree with
me but the price sure is right

WIDER

Wade sits across from his young deputies YOUNG HOLLIS (30s)
and BUDDY DEEDS (20s) A chicken-fried steak sits untouched
in front of Buddy Hollis has the anxious look of an errand
boy while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for
his age

BUDDY
Whats that for

WADE
Jimmy got a kitchen full of wetbacks
most of ‘em relatives People breed
like chickens

BUDDY
So

WADE
I roust some muchacho on the street

WADE
You got to keep the wheels greased

First of the month just like the
rent Get the car Hollis

Wade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand

BUDDY

Hollis stops a few feet away shocked Wade just stares down
at Buddy

WADE
Come again

Buddy looks Wade in the eye seemingly unafraid

BUDDY
Its your deal You sweated it out

WADE
Theres gonna be some left over for

BUDDY

WADE

You feeling bad for Jimmy Have him

run a place on the other side Those
old boys in Ciudad Leon--

BUDDY
Im not picking it up

WADE
You do whatever I say you do or else
you put it on the trail son

The CUSTOMERS are all watching now nervous Buddy thinks
for a moment not taking his eyes off Wade

BUDDY
How ‘bout this--how bout you put
that shield on this table and vanish
before you end up dead or in jail

Wade rests his hand on his pistol It is dead silent but
for the MUSIC on the box

BUDDY
You ever shoot anybody was looking
you in the eye

WADE
Who said anything about shootin
anybody

Buddy has his gun out under the table He slowly brings it
up and lays it flat on the table not taking his hand off it
or his eyes off Wade
BUDDY
Whole different story isnt it

WADE
Youre fired Youre outta the
department

BUDDY

Theres not a soul in this county
isnt sick to death of your bullshit
Charley You made yourself scarce
you could make a lot of people happy

WADE
You little pissant--

BUDDY
Now or later Charley You wont
have any trouble finding me

Wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction He
leans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper

WADE
Youre a dead man

He turns and nearly bumps into Hollis He gives the Deputy a
shove

WADE
Get the goddamn car Were going to
Rodericks

CU BUDDY

He watches till the screen door shuts behind them then
holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing
had happened He calls softly--

BUDDY
Muchacho--mas cerveza por favor

He looks up at somebody and we PAN till we see Sam still
standing over the booth listening We are back in 1995--

HOLLIS (0S)
Mas cerveza por favor

FENTON (0S)
That Buddy was a cool breeze

We PULL BACK to see Hollis and his buddies at the table
eating their lunches as they listen

FENTON
Charley Wade were known to have put
a good number of people in the ground
and your daddy gets eyeball to eyeball
with him

HOLLIS
We made our collection at Rodericks
place and that was the last anybody
seen hide nor hair of him He went
missing the next day along with ten
thousand dollars in county funds
from the safe at the jail

SAM
Never heard from him again

HOLLIS
Not a peep Buddy run the man out of
town

FENTON

Buddy Deeds said a thing he damn
well backed it up Wont be another
like him

SAM
So he arrested all of Jimmy Herreras
people and sent em back to the other
side

Hollis sees what Sam is getting at grins--

HOLLIS
Oh--he come to an accommodation
Money doesnt always need to change
hands to keep the wheels turning

SAM
Right

HOLLIS

ANGLO MOTHER
(Points at Pilar)
Well the way shes teachin it has
got everything switched around I
was on the textbook committee and
her version is not--

PRINCIPAL
We think of the textbook as kind of

teaching our children--

CHICANO MOTHER
Theyre our children too

Hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his
face

WIDER

Hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a
dock at the lake going through his box of lures Sam appears
on the dock and steps down

SAM
I always wondered what you Mayors do

SAM
(Smiles)
You recall if Charley Wade was a
Mason
HOLLIS

SAM
People have worked this whole big
thing up around my father If its

HOLLIS
And I understand why you might want
to think he could

This is a low blow but accurate enough to shake Sam
SAM
Thanks for your time Hollis

Hollis holds up a double handful of lures--dozens of rubber
and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners--—

HOLLIS
Look at all this would you My
tackle the boat all to catch a

Wade who sits with his legs stretched out at a table

Young Hollis sits by him smiling uncomfortably Sax-wailing
RandB blasts from the jukebox YOUNG OTIS a slick confident
character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on in his
early 20s stops to talk with a MAN on his way to bring a
tray with a couple beers and glasses over

MINNIE (VO)

PRETTY WOMAN sitting at the bar who is eyeing him back He
lays the beers and glasses on the table starts away

WADE

WADE
Why you think that was

Otis feels people watching He doesnt want to lose face--

YOUNG OTIS
Some crop needed pickin and the man
was shorthanded

A very insolent answer for the time and place--

WADE
As I remember it was because he had
a sassy mouth on him Must run in
the family--You wouldnt be runnin
numbers out of this club now would

YOUNG OTIS
Runnin numbers illegal

splashes on the table and drips into Holliss lap--

WADE
Aw--look what you done now Better

Half the people in the room are watching now the other half
moving away to relative safety Otis tries to keep a lid on

his temper looks around the room--

YOUNG OTIS
You spilt it you wipe it up

Wade stands steely-eyed and looks at Otis nose to nose--
WADE
I told you to do something Are you
gonna hop to it or are we gonna
have a problem

Otis is starting to shake but holds his ground--

WADE
Dont want to turn tail in front of

your people

I understand

He starts to turn away then WHAP brings the butt of his
pistol up under Otiss chin knocking him to the floor A
woman SCREAMS and Otis enraged grabs the chair he has fallen

over starts to get
his face--

up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at

RODERICK is out on the floor now
of peace

WADE
Come on Houston give it a try

as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar

petrified--

RODERICK
Dont mind him Sheriff Boys just

nothin by it--

WADE

RODERICK
Otis apologize to the Sheriff--

Otis eases the chair down but doesnt say anything--

RODERICK
You got him too scared to peep

RODERICK

Wade looks around widens his eyes in mock surprise--

WADE

violation of state law--

RODERICK
This is a club Sheriff--you been in

WADE
And people better clear out of here
Now

hands held out in a gesture
A few people start for the exit Wade swivels and BLAM sends
a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind
the bar People run for the door Wade squats down to look
Otis in the face--

CU WADE

WADE
You learn how to act your place
son This idnt Houston

He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar--

OTIS (V0O)

The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands
Otis PRESENT DAY reminiscing We are back in 95--

OTIS
I didnt understand the spot I was
putting Roderick in

We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--

OTIS
Oh--I think he came in one more time
with Hollis and--naw your Daddy
wasnt with them Made their monthly
pickup Roderick wasnt in so I just
kept my mouth good and shut and handed
over that envelope

SAM
That was the night he disappeared

OTIS
(Shakes his head)
Could of been That was white peoples
business

SAM
And when my father was Sheriff

OTIS
What about it

SAM
What was your deal with him

Otis smiles chooses his words carefully--
OTIS

Buddy was more a part of the big
picture--county political machine
chamber of commerce zoning board if
I kept those people happy he was
pretty much on my side

(Smiles)
Whenever somebody thought--they start
up another bar for the black folks
theyd be--how should I put this
Theyd be officially discouraged

SAM
He ever accept cash for a favor

Otis smiles looks away to ponder his response--

OTIS

I dont recall a prisoner ever died
in your fathers custody I dont
recall a man in this town--Black
White Mexican--whod hesitate a
minute before theyd call on Buddy
Deeds to solve a problem More than
that I wouldnt like to say

MERCEDES

She freezes smiling till the still photographers have gotten
their shots then snips the cord to a pulley system that
lets the cloth drop--

STATUE

The cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a
block of smooth limestone A decent likeness of Buddy in
uniform his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking
boy who stands beside him eyes raised worshipfully

APPLAUSE from the gathering--

SAM

Watching a bit removed as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge

feathers stuck in his headband

Spanish in Florida called him Juan
Caballo John Horse

CHET

OTIS
(Steps in)
Both

Otis crosses to the poker table begins to clean up--

run off from the slaveholders hooked
up with them married up had
children When the Spanish give up
Florida the USArmy come down to
move all them Indian peoples off to
Oklahoma--

died but them other two escaped and
put together a fighting band and
held out another ten fifteen years
Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops

OTIS
They got tired of fighting went to
the Indian Territories for a while
But the slave-raiders were on ‘em
even there and one night they packed
up and nearly the whole band rode
down to Mexico Crossed at Eagle
Pass

They move on to some photos of very African-looking people
dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing--

OTIS

Fort Duncan and the men joined up
what was called the Seminole Negro
Indian Scouts Best trackers either

Private Johnson are you unhappy in
the Army

ATHENA
No sir--

DEL

Then how would you explain the fact
that out of one hundred twenty people
we tested youre the only one who
came up positive for drugs

ATHENA
Im sorry sir

DEL
When you were given the opportunity
to enlist a kind of contract was
agreed upon I think the Army has
honored its part of that agreement

ATHENA
Yes sir--

DEL
Do you believe in what were doing
here Private Johnson

ATHENA
I-I can do the job sir

DEL
You dont sound too enthusiastic

ATHENA
I am sir

DEL
What exactly do you think your job
is Private

ATHENA
Follow orders Do whatever they say
DEL
Whos they

ATHENA
The--the officers

DEL
And thats the job Nothing about
serving your country

Athena is confused hesitates to speak--

DEL
These arent trick questions Private
Youll be given an Article 15 and be
going into the ADCAP Program one way
or the other What happens after
that is up to you Im just trying
to understand how somebody like you

thinks
Silence--

sergeant or your fellow soldiers

ATHENA
No sir They all been real straight

Del stands thinking trying not to bullshit her--

DEL

It works like this Private--every
soldier in a war doesnt have to
believe in what hes fighting for
Most of them fight just to back up
the soldiers in their squad--you try
not to get them killed try not to
get them extra duty try not to
embarrass yourself in front of them

He is right in her face now--

DEL
Why dont you start with that
ATHENA
Yes sir
