FADE IN
EXT BUCHANAN UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - DAY 1

A place of beauty Hallowed halls of brick and stone Birds
chirp Bells toll stately and serene

Statues of long-dead rich white men look out over perfectly
manicured lawns

PULL BACK THROUGH ornate gothic windows into the

INT LECTURE HALL - DAY 2

Where students sit at attention laptops open Eager
undergrads who would consider themselves woke

PROFESSOR CLARKE (0S)
If youve done the reading which
you should have--

We move across the sea of mostly WHITE faces toward the
front of the room

PROFESSOR CLARKE (0S) (CONTD)
--you probably noticed the big ol
trigger warning on the syllabus

In the middle of the pack we find KUNLE (21 Black)
listening intently to the lecture

But looking closer we see Kunles doodling in the margin of
his notes Hes sketching a cute GIRL whos biting her pen
deep in thought Hes actually pretty good

At the front of the room PROFESSOR CLARKE (50s White
British) stands behind her lectern

PROFESSOR CLARKE (0S) (CONTD)
I know were inches away from
Spring Break but Id like us all
to stay focused and respectful
today Sound good So weve talked
about the power of language

Kunle looks over at a cute girl biting her pen Well come
to know this girl as BIANCA (21 White)

As the professor goes on Kunle feels a tap on his shoulder
He turns reluctantly to see

SEAN (21 Black) his best friend leaning in
conspiratorially Hes incapable of being totally
inconspicuous
Blue 2

SEAN
(whispering)
Yo I got us into Blackout

KUNLE
For real

Sean does a quick quiet dance of celebration before
slouching back down in his seat eyes glued to the phone
screen hidden in his lap He resumes texting
Kunle turns back to the lecture where
PROFESSOR CLARKE

-were talking about hate speech

You are free to step outside if you

need to

Suddenly Kunle looks down Sean is sneakily handing him a
bottle of pink sports drink Kunle shakes his head Not now

Sean clocks Kunles drawing Takes a big swig
Kunle embarrassed turns the page hiding his sketch

A beat Kunles phone buzzes in his pocket He takes it out
Its a series of texts from Sean

you so thirsty
you drawing your own hentai cry-laugh emoji

Kunle looks over to see Sean is in fact stifling a laugh
He replies

brown middle finger
emoji
i gotchu fam
tonight im your wingman
well find you a nice horny drunk chick
string of nonsense emojis including many eggplants
Kunle rolls his eyes turns his attention back to class
PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONTD)
Before we go any further I just
want to re-state the trigger

warning Good Good So Lets talk
about the infamous N word
Blue 3

The word NIGGER is projected large on the screen overhead

PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONTD)
The word nigger has a long and
terrible history

Sean and Kunle exchange glances Did she just say it

PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONTD)
It occupies a unique space in
modern American vernacular as it
is so taboo that some of you are
likely feeling uncomfortable right
now even when the term is used in
an isolated academic context My
question for you is what makes
this word so powerful

The class is quiet Then a WHITE STUDENT raises her hand

WHITE STUDENT
I mean because its racist

PROFESSOR CLARKE
There are other racist offensive
words Why is nigger different

It catches the room off-guard again

PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONTD)
The word originates in the Spanish
negro and at first it was a
neutral term

As she continues Sean leans toward Kunle

SEAN
(sotto)
YoIs this allowed

KUNLE
I mean Its on the syllabus
There was a trigger warning

PROFESSOR CLARKE SEAN
--whereas the word nigga She keeps saying it
with an a at the end
occupies a different space
somehow lesser than its hard
r counterpart-—

Kunle notices students glancing over at him uncomfortable
Blue 4

KUNLE
Shes British Maybe she doesnt
know

SEAN

If she dont know whys she
teaching a class on it

A beat as they both realize the professor has gone quiet
And she is looking right at them

PROFESSOR CLARKE
I dont mean to put you two on the
spot but it sounds like you have
something to say Please
Sean doesnt seem to want to say anything
PROFESSOR CLARKE (CONTD)
(sincere)
This is a safe place What do you
think keeps this word so powerful

We pull out to see the rest of the students waiting eagerly
for Sean and Kunle to weigh in

KUNLE
I I think part of it is because
as a society--
The lecture hall doors burst open revealing a horde of DRUNK
GUYS (19ish White) wearing suits of armor made of Budweiser
boxes holding long swords made of duct-taped beer cans

DRUNK GUY
SPRING BREAK YEAAAAAH

Kunle watches stunned as the drunk guys charge all the way
across the room and out the opposite doors

A beat Everyone is staring at him once more

PROFESSOR CLARKE
Sorry about that You were saying

SMASH TO TITLE
Music BLARES like a POLICE SIREN One word fills the screen
EMERGENCY

SMASH BACK TO

EXT LECTURE HALL - CAMPUS - DUSK 3

Students flood out of the lecture hall Sean and Kunle among
them Sean shakes his head at Kunle They walk and talk

KUNLE

discussion Sean you couldve

Sean cringes but she seems to find it charming

BIANCA

BIANCA

She waves walks off Kunle watches her go

SEAN

They walk and talk back toward the doors

KUNLE

SEAN
Nice to your dick

EXT CAMPUS COURTYARD - DUSK

They continue out into the courtyard

SEAN
Whats the problem She likes you
Im telling you she craving that
BBC Or small-BC I aint seen it

KUNLE
I dont know Were graduating in
two months I dont want to start
something just to break up

SEAN
Or like you could just smash
(beat)
Were gonna be living like a half
hour away from here next year The
citys not that far

Beat Kunle changes the subject

KUNLE
So should we like say something
About Professor Clarke That was
fucked up right Isnt it like our
moral imperative to do something

SEAN
Were still talking about this
KUNLE SEAN (CONTD)
She didnt have to say it to Okay guess so

make her point
Blue 9

KUNLE (CONTD)
But on the other hand its a class
about blasphemy and taboos Its
literally called Blasphemy and
Taboos So if we got her fired
would that be like censorship
Im against censorship

SEAN
I mean we could start a moral
crusade Or we could just not

KUNLE
I guess she wasnt throwing the
word around like willy-nilly

SEAN
No that was some willy-nilly-ass
shit She didnt have to say it
She wanted us to react

Kunle gives him a thoughtful look Sean can see whats
coming Kunles entered into intellectual discussion mode
Once hes started he cannot be stopped

KUNLE
But that was kind of the point
right To analyze why we have that
reaction Why is it so bad Like
if a white man says the n-word
alone in the woods with no one
around to hear it is it bad

SEAN
This white dude walks into the
middle of the forest just to say
the n-word

KUNLE
Hes never said it before never
says it again He doesnt hate us
He just wants to whisper it quietly
to himself Like
(whispering)
Nigger

SEAN
Thats fucked up

KUNLE
Why though

SEAN
Youre such a fuckin Oreo man
Blue 10

That stings a bit but Kunle pushes forth

KUNLE
From a deontological perspective
maybe a word can be inherently bad
But from a consequentialist
perspective-

SEAN

Its not that complicated Most of
the rules are made by wypipo We
made like one rule that we ask
white people to respect One Thou
shalt not use that one word But
they dont like us telling them
what to do so they be looking for
loopholes So when your white man
whispers nigger in a forest he
breaketh the covenant It aint
like pure evil its disrespect

Kunle takes this in thoughtful

SEAN (CONTD)
Anyone ever called you nigger

Kunle
KUNLE
You
SEAN
No nigga not like that
KUNLE SEAN (CONTD)
I mean online-- No To your face For real

KUNLE (CONTD)
-No

Sean shrugs Then they dont need to keep talking BUZZ He
gets a text

KUNLE (CONTD)
I think this was a productive
discussion

SEAN
We all really learned something
(re the text)
FUCK Victor gave away our
Underground passes Fuck Victor
Man where we gonna find
Underground passes this late

kitchen He quietly sets the box on the counter opens it

Inside a cake in Princeton colors orange and black It says
PRINCETON on it The inside of the box lid says
Congratulations Kunle We are so proud of you He closes
it

He looks for somewhere to hide the cake box out of sight As
he hides the cake we pull back to see in the foreground

A pair of WOMAN’S LEGS with bloody knees sticking out from
behind the sofa in the living room A lamp and some books
have been knocked down onto the floor

SEAN (0S) (CONTD)
Is anything missing in there

KUNLE

An UNCONSCIOUS YOUNG WOMAN laying face-down on the floor

She’s young maybe 18 and WHITE She wears a short dress
made of PINK DUCT TAPE and lays there barefoot

shoulders SHAKES her gently

Her eyes flutter open for a moment and then close again She
GROANS rolls back onto her side Shes clearly out of it

SEAN (CONTD)

Kunle notices her scraped up knees Her skirt is pushed up a
little too much for comfort

anywhere but here

his gaming computer earbuds in extremely focused on his
game of Civilization

(Maddy doesnt appear to be anywhere in sight)

Maddy goes in for another hit but Sean grabs the stick from
Maddys hands mid-whack causing her to SCREAM in horror

calculates the best response to not seem racist

And then another

As he reaches for a third shot Asa tries to slow him down

SEAN

CARLOS (0OS)
Group hug

Out of nowhere Carlos re-forms their hug making it a group
hug The three of them embrace Beat It becomes a little too
much and they all let go

INT BIO LAB - MINUTES LATER 128
Kunle puts a slide under a microscope

He looks A suspenseful beat

KUNLE

They all breathe a sigh of relief

KUNLE (CONTD)

SEAN

CARLOS

Carlos hands Sean a granola bar from his fanny pack Sean
eats it grateful

Kunle locks the cabinet properly this time with the key The
three of them leave together

EXT CAMPUS - DAWN 129

The sun rises over campus once more
White 110

Carlos Sean and Kunle walk down the sidewalk passing some
Drunk Frat Boys on their walks of shame

They wander toward home together tired yet content
INT THE APARTMENT - A NEW DAY 130

Sean Kunle and Carlos are gathered together on the couch
playing a particularly intense game of JENGA

Kunles PRINCETON CAKE lays out Kunle cuts it distributes
pieces to some guests

Rafael is here as are Bianca and a few others

Sean clocks Bianca flirting with Kunle Gives him a look
across the table

Someone knocks at the door Kunle jumps up to get it
INT THE APARTMENT - ENTRYWAY - DAY 131

The door swings open To Kunles surprise its Maddy and
Emma Awake alert and put together Emma holds a large GIFT
BASKET

MADDY

A beat Carlos appears at his shoulder Oh

MADDY
Emma this is Kunle and Carlos
They saved your life We dont want
to intrude We just had something
to say

GOLDILOCKS
Thank you so much for everything
for getting me to the hospital
(MORE )
White 111

GOLDILOCKS (CONTD)
And sorry for apparently breaking
into your house and throwing up
everywhere So embarrassing

MADDY
I live literally two houses down
from you guys so she must have
thought this was my place

GOLDILOCKS
Thats what we think I thought
because honestly I dont remember
anything

Emma laughs Kunle and Carlos laugh along with her a tinge
of anger simmering under the surface of their smiles

MADDY
We can pay for any rugs that need
to be cleaned--

KUNLE MADDY (CONTD)
Its cool Hardwood floors Or the car

KUNLE (CONTD)
Its all good Were just glad
youre better

A beat Maddy wants to say something but cant get it out
Its starting to get awkward She cant stall any longer

MADDY
Emma why dont you go ahead I
need to talk to them for a minute

EMMA
Thanks so much again

Emma hands Carlos the gift basket and leaves the three of
them alone

MADDY
I had something I wanted to say

She awkwardly takes out a prepared statement

MADDY (CONTD)
Kunle Carlos I want to extend my
deepest apologies for what
transpired the other night I am
working on myself and what I put
out into the world Im sorry you
ended up bearing the burden of my
responsibility to look after Emma

(MORE )
White 112

MADDY (CONTD)
Im sorry I yelled at you when you
were trying to help Im sorry I
tried to pepper spray you
Alright this is weird

Maddy puts the letter away She struggles to find the words

MADDY (CONTD)

I know this isnt enough Im
just I really am sorry

(long beat)
I never got a chance to thank you
for saving Emmas life that night
She doesnt realize how close she
was to actually fucking dying So
thank you I know it wont fix
things but if theres ever
anything I can do like if you
want to get into pretty much any
party I can do that Anytime

KUNLE
Its fine Were cool

MADDY
Well offer stands You know where
to find me Two houses down

Maddy gives the guys one last apologetic look She leaves
Kunle shuts the door

CARLOS
Were cool Are we though

SEAN
I mean in a way youre lucky she
was there

Reveal Seans been watching from the doorway

SEAN (CONTD)
In another timeline were at your
funeral right now If she hadnt
been there yelling at the cops it
wouldve gone worse They wouldve
just killed you

KUNLE
You dont know that

SEAN
Neither do you
White 113

Kunle turns this over in his mind Carlos claps them both on
the backs Sean and Carlos head back toward the party

A beat Kunle follows them into

THE APARTMENT - THE LIVING ROOM —- DAY 132
Where everyone else is happily gathered around the Jenga
tower laughing drinking At ease Kunle settles onto the

couch between Sean and Carlos

BIANCA
Its your turn Kunle

He leans forward reaches for his Jenga piece The tower is
tall and full of holes Its already wobbling

When he touches his block a siren sounds outside somewhere
in the distance Kunles smile falters at the sound He cant
relax as the siren grows louder

A beat Kunle reaches out rests his block at the very top of
the tower He looks into camera as the tower teeters
dangerously

CUT TO BLACK

THE END

MID-CREDITS CODA

INT BLACK STUDENT UNION - HALL OF FIRSTS - DAY 133

We see Kunle and Sean sneak into the Hall of Firsts at night
with a step ladder They hang a plaque high high up on the
wall where nobody will notice

They leave quick as they came
A slow zoom in on the counterfeit plaque a cute photo of

Kunle and Sean (with Carlos photobomb) that says FIRST MEN TO
SNEAK THEMSELVES INTO THE HALL OF FIRSTS
