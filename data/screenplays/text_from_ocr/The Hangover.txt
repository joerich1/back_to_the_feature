A simple classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in
this sun-drenched bridal suite Sitting at the makeup table
surrounded by her bridesmaids is the beautiful bride TRACY

Just then Tracys rich stern FATHER 50s blows in

MR TURNER
Any word from Doug
The way he spits out Doug tells us all we need to know
about how Mr Turner feels about his future son-in-law

Sitting shotgun is the groom DOUG BILLINGS late 20s
handsome barefoot crunchy -- an all around great guy
Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH late 20s an anal tax
attorney from Connecticut his Izod shirt tucked into his
khakis Hes currently applying sun screen to his forehead

already four Can you believe it

DOUG
(smiling at photos)
How cute Good for you man

years When they first met Alan

Becky had a functioning hymen

VICK (CONTD)
Asking Alan if hes still with

still rises in the east
The guys try not to laugh Alan scowls

DOUG
She still pressuring you to get
married

ALAN

Enh weve moved past the pressure

stageits more like aggravated

assault stage now Like at the last

THE CASINO FLOOR
The guys power through the crowded casino towards the exit
Stu tries to keep up genuinely concerned

Quickly and from a great distance
Alans hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS

STU

Vick however recognizes the implications of the ring and
starts back towards Alan

VICK
Oh my God Oh my God

STU

(finally realizing)
Oh OH OH

Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE and shakily
takes off the massive unicorn ring

STU (CONTD)
Maybe its not a wedding ring

ALAN
(reading inscription)
To My Noble Husband Alan
The guys eyes bulge oh shit

STU
This is worse than my underwear
Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription

VICK

Alan looks off lost sick Vick stops the car short

Alan opens his mouth to respond but nothing comes out

nods

VICK
Alan Honey Have you considered

things we do when were drunk are
what we secretly want to do

ALAN
(dripping with sarcasm)
Yeah no youre absolutely right
Vick Ive always secretly wanted
to marry a bottle blonde with big
fake melon tits named Chastity

STU

have the balls to leave Becky and
this is your way of getting her to
leave you

ALAN
I was going to propose to her this
weekend you jackass

VICK
All the more reason to freak out

VICK (CONTD)

leaping over the patrons
Then the Guamians blow through the curtain panting very
upset They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the
end of the runway clear the hell out of the way

CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB

Upsetting cocktails hopping onto stages and then off again
leaping over chairs spinning around stripper poles and
finally sprinting out the front door

The massive Guamians give chase leaving a wide trail of
destruction behind them like two elephants trampling

a forest Just as theyre blowing out of the door however

THEYRE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS
being swung into their chests SMASH They both stumble
