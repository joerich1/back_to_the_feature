REVISED FIRST DRAFT

May 28 1991

FADE IN
EXT A QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

CAMERA PANS STREET TO - A two story house charming spacious
and lovely This is the ROBERTS HOUSE From an upstairs window
we see the flicker of tv screen light

INT ROBERTS BEDROOM - NIGHT

AS THE CAMERA PANS THE ROOM WE HEAR David Letterman on the tv
He’s doing the top ten list WE SEE a wedding picture of a happy
young couple on the beautiful pine dresser this is the bedroom
of a successful young couple

PULL BACK TO - KAREN ROBERTS

She’s in bed trying to sleep She is the bride in the wedding
picture Karen is one of those naturally beautiful women who
never believe it when you tell them they’re beautiful Well
maybe they do

Karen reaches across the bed But the only one there is TINY
a very large cat asleep on the pillow beside her She doesn’t

- seem all that surprised

INT MICHAEL’S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

MICHAEL ROBERTS the groom in the wedding picture paces tensely
as he talks on the phone His face is the face of a man who is
confident and secure in himself A man who knows who he is or
thinks he does

MICHAEL
(into the phone)
Give me credit for some
intelligence will you
pleaseYou think I’d have agreed
to a thirty day feasibility period
if I thought he was bluffing

Michael pours himself a drink from the bottle of Chivas on his
desk

MICHAEL (CONT)
Yeah well just don’t sound so
fucking surprised when I tell you
that twenty-five thousand is a
big number for me right now I
was hoping to leave myself with
something of a cushion

INT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Karen walks toward Michael’s office carrying the cat She can
hear Michael on the phone as she approaches
5-28-91 2

MICHAEL (0S)
I went over that shit with you
nine-hundred timesHow could
you have underestimated

Michael is surprised as the door opens and Karen walks in He
immediately softens his tone so as not to convey the impression
that anything is amiss If Karen suspects otherwise she doesn’t
let on Michael holds up a finger to indicate that he’ll be off
in a second

As Karen looks around Michael’s office she seems vaguely
amused It’s a workaholic’s delight It’s got a top of the line
personal computer a fax machine and a well stocked liquor
cabinet

MICHAEL
Okay Roger I hear you That
sounds good Right Look I
gotta go Right eleven o’clock
Fax it to me okay
(hangs up)
What are you doing up

KAREN
The television woke me

MICHAEL
(kisses her)
Go back to bed I’1l be right
there

As Michael walks over to the computer and looks at the screen
Karen places the cat down on the small couch

KAREN
What did good old Roger have to
say

Michael smiles reassuringly as he says- °

MICHAEL
We were just going some last
minute details You know with
a little bit of luck this thing
could close tomorrow

KAREN
Really

Michael starts punching some keys

MICHAEL
Roger said he’s never a seen a
deal go this smoothly Go on back
to bed
5-28-91 3
Karen smiles as she says seductively-

KAREN
Why don’t you come with me

Karen starts to kiss Michael Then her hands are all over him
Michael gives up the idea of doing anymore work tonight He
starts to lead Karen toward the door but she smiles as she
closes the door and says-

KAREN
Let’s do it here in your little
room Your secret little room

Karen pulls Michael down on the couch but Tiny the cat is
curled up there He hisses at Michael and runs out of the room

KAREN
Maybe if you paid more attention
to him he’d like you better

MICHAEL
I don’t want him to like me I
hate that cat

KAREN
(smiling)
You don’t like Tiny and I don’t
like Roger So we’re even

MICHAEL
(laughs)
Wives never like their husband’s
old college roommates

Karen takes off her nightgown She’s really a beautiful woman
Michael reaches for her but they are suddenly interrupted by
A LOUD SOUND from downstairs

KAREN
What was that

But all that Michael’s concerned with right now is making love
to his wife

MICHAEL
Probably just your cat

He kisses Karen again who smiles now as she wraps herself
around Michael But then ANOTHER SOUND from downstairs Karen
is really alarmed now and Michael knows that no sex will be
had around here until he investigates

MICHAEL
(getting up)
I’1l be right back

5-28-91 4

KAREN
Maybe we should call the police

MICHAEL
(laughs)
How about the National Guard Lock
the door behind me and don’t do
anything stupid while I’m gone

Like what

MICHAEL
Like putting your nightgown back
on

Michael smiles and walks out of the room
INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Michael starts for the stairs but then he stops He opens up
a hall closet reaches in for something A golf club Better
to be safe than sorry

INT LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Michael hits the lights The living room and it’s contents are
illuminated The Nantucket sofa the pine coffee table the
wicker rockerMichael moves slowly through them golf club
in hand toward the front door He tries the door It’s locked
He checks the windows All bolted No sign of forced entry
anywhere in this room He opens the closet It’s one of those
huge walk-in affairs and it’s cluttered with clothes and
unpacked cartons Tough to see in here Michael pokes around
with his golf club Nothing jumps out at him He’s breathing
easier but he’s still holding onto that golf club as he heads
for the kitchen

CUT TO
KAREN IN THE OFFICE
-She’s got her nightgown back on and she’s starting to look
nervous What’s taking Michael so long Then Karen is suddenly
startled by A LOUD NOISE right behind her She wheels around
to see-
THE FAX MACHINE
-sending a transmission from Roger Karen takes a deep breath
INT THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

Michael comes in He hits the light switch The light bulb
flickers once and goes out The bulb’s burned out

5-28-91 5

MICHAEL
Shit

Michael tightens his grip around the golf club as he makes his
way slowly through the darkened kitchen toward the door that
opens onto the backyard He tries the door It’s locked
securely

Michael is now sure that this has been a false alarm He leans
his golf club against the table opens up the refrigerator door’
- and pulls out a bottle of mineral water But as he tilts his
head back to take a drink he sees something above him in the
pale light cast by the refrigerator bulb-

THE SKYLIGHT HAS BEEN FORCED OPEN

Michael is immediately seized by the terrifying realization that
an intruder is inside of his home The water bottle falls out
of his hana and smashes to the floor as he makes a hurried grab
for the golf club

“BACK TO KAREN

eas she reacts to the sound of glass breaking down below She
rushes out of the office

BACK TO MICHAEL IN THE KITCHEN

“as he charges toward the door he steps on a shard of glass
from the broken water bottle and cuts his foot It doesn’t slow
him down as he charges into-

THE LIVING ROOM
-where he is alarmed to find Karen

MICHAEL
Get back upstairs and-

KAREN
(sees his foot)
What happened

MICHAEL
Just listen to me
goddamnitLock the door and call
the police Tell then-

The door to the walk-in closet is suddenly flung open It
smashes into Michael’s back The golf club goes flying and
Michael is sent sprawling Karen screams as THE BURGLAR comes
rushing out of the closet This guy is big young and scared

- the worst possible combination

Michael scrambles up and rushes the burglar who is heading
toward the front door Karen screams-

»

5-28-91 6

KAREN
MichaelNo

Michael tackles the burglar and down they go

MICHAEL
(to Karen)
Call the police

The burglar sees Karen heading for the phone and this really
gets his adrenalin going He gets out from under Michael and
punches him hard in the face nearly knocking him out Then he
charges the terrified Karen He tears the phone out of her hand
and grabs her roughly from behind He’s got his arm pressed hard
across Karen’s breasts as he starts backing her up toward the
kitchen

KAREN
Michael

Michael struggles to his feet and starts toward them
INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

As the burglar keeps moving toward the back door with Karen
he grabs up a huge carving knife from a rack oh the wall He
places it against the terrified Karen’s throat as he shouts at
the advancing Michael-

BURGLAR
Don’t be a hero man or I will
fuck your old lady up

Michael immediately does what he’s told stopping in his tracks
as the burglar gets the back door open and disappears through
it with Karen Michael just stands there his head is spinning
from fear and confusion Then from somewhere outside he hears
KAREN SCREAM Michael takes off running toward the back door
shouting-

MICHAEL
Karen

EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT

Michael rushes outside It’s pitch black out here He can’t see
one damned thing Then-

KAREN (0S)
(hoarsely)
Michael

Michael sees Karen huddled against the side of the house She’s
shivering with absolute terror Michael is flooded with relief
as he takes her into his arms and just holds her as she cries

5-28-91 7

EXT ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT
WE SEE THE WORDS - TO PROTECT AND SERVE

- They are printed on the door of the patrol car that is parked
in the driveway Two uniformed police officers stand at the
door They ring the bell

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Karen opens the door to the two officers The red light on their
patrol car’s turret casts a glow that to Karen at this moment
is comforting

KAREN
Please come in I’m Karen
Roberts

The two cops step inside the house Officer PETE LANE with his
all- American good looks would be perfect for an LAPD
recruiting poster His partner Officer Roy Cole is slightly
older quieter and more intense Roy hangs back and lets Pete
do the talking

PETE
I’m Officer Lane This is my
partner Officer Cole

KAREN
Hello

Roy just nods Pete spots the blood on the floor

PETE
Was somebody hurt

KAREN
My husband stepped on some glass
It isn’t serious He should be
out in a minute

Karen glances nervously down the hall for Michael

PETE
Why don’t you tell us what
happened

Roy pulls out his pad and takes notes as Karen talks

KAREN
We were upstairs in my husband’s
office We heard a noise Michael
went downstairs and after awhile
I heard another noise so

Karen is frightened and she’s having trouble continuing
5-28-91 8

po PETE
vo (gently)
Take your time

KAREN
This manhe came charging out
of the closet He and Michael
fought

Now Michael enters the room He’s walking with a Slight limp
and there is a trace of embarrassment in his voice as he says-

MICHAEL
It wasn’t all that much of a
fight I’m sorry to say Then he
grabbed Karen and took off through
the back

PETE
(to Karen)
Are you all right

KAREN
Yesthank you

Tiny the cat rubs up against Pete’s leg and Karen smiles for
the first time as she says-

‘a

KAREN
Tiny likes you
Pete pets the cat as he says-

PETE
Hey Tinynot a very good
watchcat are you

MICHAEL
Cat’s useless

PETE
(to Michael)
Can you show us how this guy got
into the house

MICHAEL
Yeah he came in through the
kitchen

- As Pete and Roy follow Michael and Karen toward the kitchen
they pass a lamp whose light silhouette Karen’s shapely body
beneath her silky nightgown Roy nudges Pete and gives hima
salacious smile indicating that he thinks Karen Roberts looks

pretty good But Pete shakes his head disgustedly at Roy like
he can’t believe what a jerk his partner is being right at this
moment
(fT

5-28-91 9

‘INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Pete trains his flashlight on the broken skylight Roy makes
notes

ROY
We’1l be sending somebody over
tomorrow to dust for prints Would
you prefer morning or afternoon

MICHAEL
Tomorrow’s so busyWhy don’t
we say morning

They walk back out into the living room
INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

PETE
Weve had several of these
break-ins in this area lately
We’re pretty sure they were all
done by the same guy

KAREN
(alarmed)
You don’t thinkthat he could
come back

ROY
(shrugs)
Anything’s possible

MICHAEL
Why would the same guy come back

ROY
Because he left empty-handed

Karen is becoming increasingly tense and there’s an edge in her
voice as she says to Michael-

KAREN
You told me the Realtor did a
whole speech about how safe this
neighborhood is

Before Michael can reply Roy speaks up-

ROY
Your Realtor lied

Karen and Michael react to Roy’s bluntness So does Pete He
shoots Roy a look Roy gets the message
5-28-91 10

ROY
I’m going to take a look around
outside Maybe somebody saw
something

Roy goes out the door Pete says sincerely-

PETE
Look all things considered this
is a safe neighborhood and
Believe me the chances of this
guy coming back here are really
slim to none

MICHAEL
Yeah well I’m sure that’s true
but I’m not going through another
night like this one I’m getting
a gun

Karen is almost shouting as she says-

KAREN
No No guns in this house
Michael is exasperated He appeals to Pete-

MICHAEL
Maybe she’ll listen to you

PETE
(shakes his head)
Don’t do it The worst calls we
get are from people who’ve
accidentally shot some relative
in the middle of the night

Karen smiles at Pete This wasn’t the answer she was expecting
from a cop But Michael is annoyed

MICHAEL
I’m not going to shoot some
relative

PETE
(smiling)
Anyway you look at it guns make
a mess A much bigger mess than
that

Pete points to the small pool of blood on the floor
EXT ROBERTS HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

Michael and Karen have got the door open Pete is standing
outside

5-28-91 11

PETE
I meant what I-said about that
burglar alarm Otherwise you’re

just inviting trouble right into
your home Goodnight

Goodnight

Pete heads toward the car where Roy is waiting Karen seems
despondent as she watches Pete get into the car It’s like she
felt safe as long as the police were around but now

KAREN
He was a nice guy

MICHAEL
I suppose so For a cop

INT ROBERTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
As Michael closes the door Karen suddenly rushes toward the
cabinet in the hall She flings it open

MICHAEL
What are you doing

Karen pulls the Yellow Pages out of the cabinet

KAREN
I’m not spending the night here
with that skylight wide open

Karen begins to frantically turn through the book
MICHAEL
Were not going to get anybody
to fix that thing tonight

But Karen isn’t about to listen to reason She has to do this
she has to do something to keep the terror at bay

KAREN
Just tell me what to look under

MICHAEL
And besidesKaren the police
are dusting for fingerprints
tomorrow We’re not supposed to
touch anything

Karen starts crying as the terror of the evening comes crashing
down on her

5-28-91 12

KAREN
He touched me Michael He put
his hands all over meHe said
things to me

MICHAEL
(angrily)
That goddamned sonavabitch

KAREN
I thought for a minute that he
was going toI thought he

Michael’s getting angrier by the second but he has to keeps
his temper in check so he can comfort his wife

MICHAEL
Honey it’s over now Tomorrow
well get the skylight repaired
and I‘’11 call somebody about a
burglar alarm It’s going to be
okay

But Karen doesn’t look like she believes hin
EXT ROBERTS HOUSE - DAY

A UNIFORMED POLICEWOMAN is up on the ledge outside the broken
skylight She’s dusting for fingerprints around the area of
forced entry

Waiting below are Karen Michael and ROGER a nervous looking
guy about Michael’s age Roger’s three piece suit is
immaculately tailored he is obviously a man who knows how to
match his checks and stripes

ROGER
If somebody broke into my house
while I was in it I’d have had
a heart attack

MICHAEL
(smiling)
You are such a chickenshit

ROGER
(smiling)
Better than being a dead hero
(checks watch)
You know it’s after ten

MICHAEL
(to Karen)
Honey

Karen can’t conceal the edge in her voice as she says-
5-28-91 4B

KAREN
Go on Michael I know how
important this meeting is

MICHAEL
I‘11 call you later

Michael gives Karen a quick kiss then he and Roger hurry off
to Roger’s white Saab Roger is a bit nervous as he says-

ROGER
Jerome Richter’s a very tough
customer Are you sure you’re
up to this today

MICHAEL
(smiling)
Just drive

Karen watches them drive off Then-

POLICEWOMAN (0S)
Mrs Roberts ’

Karen turns to the policewoman who is shaking her head to
indicate no fingerprints were found Karen just stands there
filling with dread

EXT AN OLD BUS STATION - DAY

This station which is no longer in use is right on the edge
of the downtown area just a short walk away from the sleek
new office buildings which seem to be almost marching toward
this run down neighborhood Though the station has become as
beaten up as the rest of this area you can see the exquisite
art deco detailing in its design and easily imagine that at one
time this place must have really been something A WINO sleeps
in the door Two cars are parked out front Roger’s Saab and

a top of the line Mercedes

INT BUS STATION - DAY

One good sized section of the station has been cordoned off by a
cleaning crew of about thirty men who are diligently working to
restore it to its former glory Gorgeous marble tiled floor is
beginning to show through the grime Men up on scaffolds are
painting walls and shining up the beautiful crystal chandeliers

Michael Roger and JEROME RICHTER look at one of the many
architectural renderings that are pasted up around the walls
‘Richter in his early fifties is obviously a powerful man
Richter seems to be studying Michael as he says-
Ce

5-28-91

RICHTER
Restaurants are a tricky
proposition On any coast If
this one doesn’t fly that’s the
end of your franchise

Roger is nervous but Michael looks Richter confidentially
the eye as he says-

MI
Itll fly

RICHTER
What makes you so sure

MICHAEL

In the first place we’ve got a
great location This whole area
is obviously ripe for
refurbishment Look out
thereThe people who work there
have to eat someplace

Michael points out the window toward-
THE SLEEK DOWNTOWN OFFICE BUILDINGS

MICHAEL
We’re also going to have great
food and first class management
I am this close to closing a deal
with a world class chef for a
hundred and a quarter plus five
percent of the gross

RICHTER
And management

MICHAEL
(smiling)
Mr Richter I’m not just another
out of work east coast stockbroker
with too much time on his hands
I am going to run this place

RICHTER
Oh

MICHAEL
My uncle owned a restaurant I
know the business inside out I
plan to be personally responsible
for everything both before and
after this place opens up

in
5-28-91 15

MICHAEL (Cont’d)
That means that I hire all
personnel-from the dishwaters to
the accountants I get the
permits I -

Richter listens poker faced he’s a good businessman so it’s
tough to tell what he’s thinking But Michael’s confidence and
enthusiasm are infectious and Roger can’t help but smile as
he watches Michael in action

INT ROBERTS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

Michael is trying to make love to his wife but Karen is tense
She struggles to relax as she closes her eyes and holds her
husband close but finally-

KAREN
MichaelI’m sorry

Michael leans over and strokes Karen’s hair

MICHAEL
You know it’s been almost a week
since the break in

KAREN
What do you want to know When
I’1l be calm enough to make love
to you again

Michael smiles He’s trying to keep things light

MICHAEL
You don’t have to give me an exact
date

Karen doesn’t find Michael amusing She sits up on the side of
the bed with her back toward Michael

MICHAEL
I just hate to see you so jumpy
all the time

KAREN
Not one word from the police They
aren’t going to get him

MICHAEL
They will

KAREN
He could come back Do you realize
that That cop said that-

5-28-91 16

MICHAEL
He’s not going to come back And
besides the alarm people are
coming on Saturday

KAREN
I want to sell this house I don’t
want to live here anymore

Michael’s not taking this seriously He says-

MICHAEL
Karenyou love this house

KAREN
No Michael you love this house
I didn’t need all this I didn’t
even want to come out here and
now we’re in way over our heads

Though Michael laughs like Karen’s being ridiculous it’s clear
she’s hit a nerve

MICHAEL
What are you talking about

KAREN
( Oh come on If this restaurant
deal doesn’t come through we’re
broke arent we

MICHAEL
You think I’d leave us without
a cushion There’s still plenty
of money left over and besides
it went great with Richter

KAREN
He didn’t say yes

MICHAEL
He will He’s coming to the party
isn’t he Believe me he-

KAREN
I can’t keep doing this I cant
keep living on the edge

Michael’s temper is starting to rise

MICHAEL
Hey Karendon’t worry about
it okay The deal is going to
close Unlike your father I
fo happen to know what I’m doing

A

5-28-91 17

Michael softens his tone determined not to let his wife be
overwhelmed by her dark mood He puts his arms around her as
he says-

MICHAEL

I’ve never let you down have I
You’re going to have all the
things you deserve That’s why
we’re out here That’s what the
restaurant’s for So that I can
give you those things Give our
kid those things

Michael starts to kiss Karen’s neck

MICHAEL
There is nothing to be afraid of

But Karen’s too tense too frightened She moves away from
Michael as she kisses his cheek and says-

KAREN
Goodnight Michael I’m sorry
As Karen lies back down Michael sits there on the bed If there
was something he could say he’d say it But for once he
doesn’t know what that might be Then off in the distance he
hears THE DISTANT WAIL OF A SIREN A police car Now it is
Michael who tenses up and he reaches below the bed where he’s
got a baseball bat handy As Michael wraps his hand around it
he locks eyes with Tiny the cat who’d been curled up on the
floor Tiny seems to be looking at him with a look that says
you’re not fooling anybody pal You’re just as scared as Karen

INT FIRING RANGE - DAY

Officer Pete Lane is blasting away with deadly accuracy From
the look of intensity on his face you’d think he was ina life
and death situation instead of on a firing range

Watching Pete shoot are his partner Roy and DAN a younger cop
The look on Roy’s face indicates that he doesn’t quite
understand why Pete is trying so hard Dan on the other hand
is thoroughly impressed by Pete ‘

When he’s finished Pete pulls in the target and smiles at Roy
ROY
So you can out shoot me Big
fucking dealWhat do you want
a medal
Pete winks at Dan as he says to Roy-

PETE
I got a medal

5-28-91 18

INT POLICE STATION DAY

uniformed cops have their desks Cops are shooting the shit

Pete pours two cups from the nearby coffee station

PETE
Would it be helpful for Mrs
Roberts to know that we might have
a lead

MICHAEL
Are you kidding
(beat)
Have you got a lead

PETE
Too soon to talk about it but
I am optimistic

Michael sips his coffee Looks Pete over Seems like a decent
guy He gets an idea

MICHAEL
Would it be asking too much for
you to drop by our house when
you’re passing by and telling that
G to my wife

PETE
Well I-

Michael springs into action He wants this to happen

MICHAEL
Look if I’m out of line just

Wellyeah

EXT POLICE STATION - DAY

5-28-91

Michael is pleased and proud Praise like this from a cop is

good for his ego

MICHAEL
Thanks Pete but manwhat I
wouldnt give for one more shot
at that sonavabitch

PETE
You seem like a guy who can handle-
himself What happened

Michael becomes more animated now For reasons he’d be hard put

to explain he wants to impress Pete

MICHAEL
In the first place I was limping”
around with a fucking chunk of
glass in my foot and then the
cocksucker caught me off guard
I never really had a chance

Pete studies Michael for a moment Then-

PETE
Suppose you did have another shot
at himWhat would you do to him

MICHAEL
(laughs)
Are you kidding What do you
think

PETE
I don’t know That’s why I’m
asking

MICHAEL

PETE
(smiling)
I already know what I’d do I was
just wondering about a nice
civilized guy like you

MICHAEL
Let me tell you somethingAfter

PETE
Michael you’re a scary guy See

Then Pete gets in his car

MICHAEL
Yeah See you And thanks again

Michael’s feeling good His conversation with Pete has gotten
him pumped up He waves as Pete drives off

EXT ROBERTS HOUSE - DAY

An alarm is clanging noisily from inside There’s a truck in
the driveway The sign says - WAGNER SECURITY SYSTEMS

INT ROBERTS HOUSE - DAY

The house is swarming with a security crew who are putting the
finishing touches on an elaborate alarm installation that even
includes some tv monitors The alarm itself is deafening

Michael and Karen look on as WAGNER a humorless man who looks
like a former Green Beret shows off the new system’s central
control panel The keypunch is a confusing configuration of
buttons switches and lights

WAGNER
It’s a passive infrared space
detector When your perimeter
is armed your interior is
virtually impenetrable Best
damned system that money can buy

MICHAEL
I was thinking of something a
little simpler Like a moat with
a nice drawbridge

The alarm suddenly stops clanging Wagner is staring at Michael
It’s clear that he hasn’t found Michael’s little joke amusing
WAGNER

Mr Robertswhat you went

through was a cakewalk compared

to what might have happened What

still might happen if you don’t

have adequate security

5-28-91 22

MICHAEL
I was only-

Wagner now turns to Karen

WAGNER
Do you know how many rapes are
committed by burglars How many
homicides

Karen is shaken but before she can respond-

PETE (0S)
What is all this shit

PETE LANE

- has just come in through the open front door In his black
leather jacket and jeans you’d never pin Pete Lane for a cop
Michael is very glad to see hin

MICHAEL
Hey Pete

Pete nods to Michael and Karen as he heads right for Wagner
who clearly doesn’t like this interruption

PETE
They don’t need tv
monitorsThis is a house not
a damned jewelry store

Wagner is really angry He gets right into Pete’s face

WAGNER
Who the hell do you think you are

Pete pulls out his wallet Flashes his badge Wagner becomes
very uncomfortable He tries to smile

WAGNER
I was just trying to-

PETE
You were trying to scare the shit
out of then —

Michael and Karen can’t see the look in Pete’s eye but Wagner
can It is thoroughly intimidating

PETE
Now just put in the alarm and cut
out the crap

As Wagner nods meekly and goes off Pete turns back toward
Michael and Karen He’s smiling again

5-28-91 23

PETE

I hope you didn’t have your hearts
set on laser beams

Michael heads off toward the kitchen He’s going to let Pete
handle this

MICHAEL
Can I get you a beer

PETE
Sure Thanks
(to Karen) ”
I wanted to tell you personally
that we may have a lead on your
burglar

KAREN
(elated)
What How

PETE
All I can say right now is that
I think we are very close In the
meantime you have a beautiful
and very safe home not to mention
a nice brave husband and a killer
cat Why not relax and enjoy them

KAREN
(smiling)
Poor Michael I guess I have been
a littletense

Pete smiles Then as he glances at Wagner and his security crew
who are starting to remove the tv monitors and the rest of
the more elaborate paraphernalia

PETE
I’m off today Maybe I oughtta

on their toes That okay with you

Karen just smiles This offer is too good to be true and she’s
feeling safer and more secure by the minute

‘a PETE
The switches around those magnetic
contacts are recessed so you can’t
even see them They really did
a good job
KAREN
All I want to know iswill it
keep out burglars

This is the big question for Karen Finally Pete smiles as he

says-
PETE
Karendust couldn’t settle in
this house without tripping that
alarm

Karen lights up Michael smiles at Pete who gives him a private
little wink
PETE
Well I oughtta get going

KAREN
How about staying for dinner

C Pete seems totally surprised and caught off guard Michael seems
a little bit surprised himself

PETE
I’d like to but

MICHAEL
Come on Pete it’s the least we
can do after-

PETE
You’re asking me to cross the line
here

MICHAEL

What do you mean

Michael and Karen are both looking at Pete What does he mean
Then Pete laughs and says-

PETE
You know cops on one side

better police-community relations ©

INT DINING ROOM - LATER

Dinner’s over Karen is cleaning off the table as Michael sits
across the table from Pete who seems just a little bit out of
place in this setting

MICHAEL
You like to go out in style every
now and then don’t you

PETE
Sure

MICHAEL
But you’re probably fed up with
having to spend fifteen bucks for
a glass of mediocre Chardonnay
and twenty-five bucks for a
microscopic piece of swordfish
At one of my restaurants you can
have a great meal and an elegant
evening for less money than you
would spend at a concert
Affordable elegance That’s all
I’m talking about

PETE
Getting something like that going
must take a lot of money I guess
you’re doing pretty well

Michael gives Karen a sly smile as he says-

MICHAEL
Hear that honey We’re doing
pretty well
(to Pete)

Municipals treasury bonds sone
real estateI was leveraged
And smart enough to get out of
the market before it went south

Karen smiles as she throws her arms around her husband and says
to Pete-

KAREN
(teasing)
He got lucky

MICHAEL
(laughing)
Hey

Karen kisses Michael then she heads into the kitchen As they
watch Karen leave Pete says with a slight smile-

5-28-91 26

PETE
You’re a lucky man in general
aren’t you

MICHAEL
Yeah I guess I am She’swhat
can I sayI think she’s Karen
again Thank you

PETE
It was my pleasure

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Michael sits in his luxuriously overstuffed club chair and Karen
sits on the floor by his feet Neither one touches their coffee
as they pay rapt attention to Pete who’s in the middle of a
story Charlie Parker blows from the very expensive stereo -
the nervous bee-bop is a fitting accompaniment

PETE
There’s not a backup unit in
sight and there I am trying to
keep my partner from bleeding to
death while this whacked out kid
is taking pot shots at me

Karen and Michael are spellbound hanging on Pete’s every word
But then Pete stops smiles and shakes his head as he says- ‘

PETE
The exciting life of a cop
That’s the only thing cops know
how to talk about That’s why we
stick together Nobody else can
stand us

MICHAEL
Are you kidding Go on Finish
the story
KAREN
Please What happened

PETE
Let’s just say that I came out
of it okay

KAREN

And how about your partner
PETE

You met him with me the night of

the break-in

Michael and Karen smile with surprise Then-

5-28-91 27

‘KAREN
Have you ever been married

MICHAEL
(laughing)
Look out Now she’s going to try
to fix you up with some secretary
from school How about another
beer

Michael gets up and head out of the room Pete smiles sadly as
he says to Karen-

PETE
Marriage and cops are a toug
combination You see after eight
straight hours of flying around
on black coffee and
adrenalineight straight hours
of dealing with crap decent human
beings can’t even imagineIt’s
kind of tough to come home and
have somebody ask you how did
your day go dear

KAREN
I suppose

PETE

(smiles)
And me jerk that I amI‘’d
always make the same mistake and
tell her

(beat)
I’da give anything if I didn’t have
to see the shit I seebut it
wouldn’t matter I’d still know
it was out there

Karen is touched by Pete’s sincerity Then-

PETE
(laughing)
Hey I’m sorry

MICHAEL
For what

PETE
For running off at the mouth You
probably wouldn’t believe me if
I told you that when I was a kid
I hardly ever talked at all In
school I never talked I was
famous for it

5-28-91 28

Pete’s expression changes It’s as though he was embarrassed
at having revealed this secret about himself to these strangers
He forces a smile as he says-

PETE
My teachers probably thought there
was something wrong with me

Karen picks up on what Pete is feeling She smiles as she says-

KAREN
Take it from another teacher we
love having quiet little boys in
our class And it’s a funny thing
about those little boysthey’re
usually the ones we end up
remembering

Pete is no longer embarrassed He smiles at Karen Michael comes
in with two more beers

EXT ROBERTS’ HOUSE NIGHT

Pete is outside talking to Michael and Karen who stand in the
door

PETE
Starting tonight until this
jerk’s off the street I’m going
make sure there’s a patrol car
in this neighborhood all night
long

Michael and Karen smile Pete is too good to be true Karen
takes Pete’s hand as she says sincerely-

KAREN
Thank you Pete For everything

Pete seems a little uncomfortable and he quickly withdraws his
hand But he smiles as he says-

PETE
Goodnight

Pete is about to head toward his car when Michael says-

MICHAEL
I’1l1 walk you to you car
(to Karen)
I’1l be right back

Karen seems just a little surprised as she watches Michael and

Pete walk toward Pete’s car which is right in front of the
house Then she closes the door

5-28-91 ‘ 29

Michael and Pete walk toward Pete’s car It’s an old Plymouth
Pete pats it’s hood as he says-

PETE

He’s looking over a form that officially releases the police
department from all responsibility in the event that something
should happen to him while he’s out on patrol with the LAPD

5-28-91 32

MICHAEL
(nodding)
Anything else

PETE
(smiling)

Michael smiles as he does what he’s told and as Pete pulls out
into the street he says with a mysterious smile-

PETE
I’ve got a feeling you’re really
going to enjoy yourself tonight

EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

A YOUNG COUPLE are about to step off the curb and cross against
the light just as Pete’s car turns the corner

INSIDE THE CAR
PETE
(into mike)
Get back on the curb and wait for
the light

The young couple are startled by the sudden appearance of the
cop car and by the amplification of Pete’s voice They jump back
on the curb

Michael can’t help but identify with the couple and there’s just
a trace of sarcasm in his voice as he says-

MICHAEL
You guys sure like telling people
what to do

If Pete detects Michael’s sarcasm he lets it go by

PETE
It’s a confusing world People
like having somebody to tell them
what to do

The dispatcher’s voice crackles on the radio Pete grabs up the
mike and takes the call All Michael can make is out something
about a 211 at Industrial Place

PETE
Possible break-in Ready to roll

Pete’s looking a Michael with a smile that is just a little bit
challenging Michael is suddenly nervous

MICHAEL
Lets do it

5-28-91 33

Pete turns on the lights and siren Michael’s head snaps back
as the car goes screaming off down the center lane

EXT A WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

On the fringes of downtown All warehouses factories and auto
graveyards Except for an unseen barking junkyard dog there are
no signs of life Except for Michael and Pete

Pete who’s leading the way doesn’t seem the least bit worried
Matter of fact he’s whistling Michael however is moving
slowly and very tentatively

PETE
You okay Michael You can wait
in the car

MICHAEL
I’m okay butshouldn’t you at
least have your gun drawn or
something

PETE
I told you I don’t like guns
and besides if my number’s up
so be it

Michael really doesn’t understand how Pete can be taking this
so lightly

MICHAEL
What about my number

Pete laughs They get to the door of the warehouse Pete knocks
He knocks again Finally from within- —

JESS (0S)
Who is it

PETE
Open up Jess It’s Pete

The door is opened by JESS an old man ina security guard
uniform Very excited to see Pete

JESS
Sonavabitch tried to get in
through the window Did you see

PETE
No You must have scared the prick
away Jess

5-28-91 34

JESS
(big smile)
Yeahguess I didWell come

and-

PETE
I can’t tonight

The old man is disappointed Pete whispers conspiratorially as
he nods in Michael’s direction

PETE
Brass He’d be all over my ass
for goldbricking

JESS
(nodding)
Next time

EXT WAREHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
Pete and Michael head back toward the car

MICHAEL
(disbelief)
Youre telling me that this guy
calls in a false alarm two or
three times a week

PETE

People get lonely in the middle
of the night Some go down to the
Seven-Eleven for some nachos that
they don’t really want

MICHAEL
(he gets it)
And some call the police to report
a prowler that they don’t really
see

EXT TACO STAND - NIGHT

Somewhere up La Brea Very sleazy Mexican music is blasting
This eatery is strictly for those who aren’t concerned about
living long lives The people who come here for lunch you
wouldn’t want to have over for dinner

As Michael and Pete stand by the counter waiting for their
food it quickly becomes obvious to Michael that Officer Pete
Lane is like a celebrity around here All of these characters
seem to know Pete and he knows them Some call his name some
wave or just smile in his direction Michael is impressed

5-28-91

PETE
You’re gonna love it here
Michael If the crackhead behind
you doesn’t get you the burritos
definitely will

MICHAEL
Maybe I should have worn a tie

PETE
(laughs)
Hey how about opening a chain
of these places Some of that
affordable elegance you were
talking about

Michael smiles but he’s clearly a little bit nervous Pete or
no Pete this place is scary A large BLACK GUY named LEON gets

in line He smiles at Pete as he says-

LEON
Hey Officer Petemy man

Pete and Leon shake hands It’s one of those elaborate soul
handshakes and Pete’s got it down cold As he shakes hands he

continues his conversation with Michael

PETE
You know if I was to make any
one of these animals turn their
pockets inside out we’d be up
to our asses in PCP crack and
Uzis This place is like one giant
supermarket of shit

LEON

Shit Officer Pete you know
meI don’t do none of that shit
no more I ain’t into nothing

PETE
(smiling)
It’s your life Leon

Now Pete notices a burly guy named MELVIN who’s
with needle marks and tattoos-

PETE
Hey Melvinwhat did I tell you
about ruining my appetite Hit
it

eating a
hamburger at one of the nearby benches His arms are covered

Pete’s fans laugh but Melvin doesn’t think Pete’s funny

5-28-91 36

bo MELVIN
Hey fuck you man I’m allowed
to fucking eat here

Pete’s tone is dead serious as he says-

PETE
Melvin we can be friends or I
can fuck you up Which is it

Melvin is mad He leaps up from the bench and stares at Pete
Pete gives it back to him His stare is cold and hard he’s
daring this guy to fuck with him Michael is wondering what’s
going to happen next and so is everybody else Then Melvin backs
down He grabs up his hamburger and walks out of the place
muttering obscenities

Michael breathes an audible sigh of relief It’s hard not to
be impressed by Pete at this moment Pete points to a bench
where a PRETTY LATIN GIRL is having her lunch Pete smiles
somewhat mischievously as he says

PETE
Why don’t you go grab that bench

Michael does as he’s told He barely notices the Latin girl
sitting there because he’s too spooked by this place to take
his eyes off of Pete But then he is startled by something He
turns around to the Latin girl sitting beside him Her hand is
on Michael’s crotch

GIRL
You like a captain or something
MICHAEL
What
GIRL

You don’t got no uniforn

MICHAEL
No

Michael grabs her hand He tries to remove it from his crotch
but she’s got a firm grip

Pete arrives now with a tray of food He’s laughing like he knew
all along this would happen when he sent Michael over to this
bench He says to the girl in Spanish-

PETE

Come on Rosa beat itMy

partner’s a married man
The girl laughs as she moves off

5-28-91 37

MICHAEL
(laughing)
Who was that

PETE
She thought you were a cop
Certain types of women really like
cops They think we’re movie
stars

Pete isn’t bragging Actually he seems a little bit disgusted

MICHAEL
I see

PETE
When I first joined the forceI
don’t think I ever arrested one
of these pricks without fucking
either his old lady or his
girlfriend

Michael’s not sure if Pete is kidding or not He laughs
uneasily

MICHAEL
What

PETE
I even banged one guy’s mother

Now Michael is really blown All he can say is-

MICHAEL
And Karen thinks you’re lonely

They begin to eat

EXT PETE’S CAR - NIGHT

The car creeps slowly down Hollywood Blvd The part that
assaults your senses with everything it’s got- the hookers and
the crackheads and the gang bangers and oh yeahthe tourists
INSIDE THE CAR

“Michael looks out of the window Taking it all in People are
looking at him they think he’s a cop Some smile Most don’t

PETE
See that guy over there

POV - A MAN WALKING DOWN THE STREET

-he doesn’t look like a weirdo He just seems happy
C

5-28-91 38

PETE
Why do you think he’s smiling like
that

Michael considers this to be an odd question He laughs

MICHAEL
How should I know

Pete’s tone is just a bit sharp as he says-

PETE

Come on Michael here’s this very
normal average kind of guynot
unlike you and he’s walking down
Hollywood Blvd with a big fucking
smile plastered across his
faceWhy might that be

MICHAEL
I don’t-

PETE

(more sharply now)
You wanted to come out here and
play cop tonight so how about
trying to think like a cop

Michael hasn’t seen Pete angry before He tries to just let it
go

MICHAEL
OkayHe’s smiling because he
beat his buddy in racquetball for
the first time this morning

PETE
Yeah or maybe he’s thinking about
the terrific head that he got last
night

MICHAEL
Maybe

PETE
There was this one guyHe used
to walk around smiling too Rich
bastard Lived over in Pasadena
What made him smile was young
illegal Mexican boys He’d pick
‘em up around here or buy ’em down
in Baja then he’d drive them up
to his place and fuck them in the
ass until he got tired of then

5-28-91 39

( PETE (Cont’d)

Then he’d slit their throats and
dump ‘em somewhere The desert
probably

(almost smiling)
And see we knew he was doing it
but we could never nail the
sonavabitch He was smart You
see Michael out here a cop can’t
take nothing for granted Not once
you know about the shit that makes
these animals smile

Michael is horrified by this repellent tale and he can’t even
look at Pete as he says-

MICHAEL
Yeah well I’m sure glad I don’t
have to go though life looking
at the world like that

Pete doesn’t look at Michael but it’s clear from his expression
that he’s taken what Michael’s just said as an insult

EXT PETE’S CAR - NIGHT

i It’s parked behind a red corvette that Pete’s pulled over A
CA trashy blonde named TERRY is behind the wheel Pete waves to
her as she drives off WE SEE the personalized license plate

that says - LUV-ZIT

Michael laughs as Pete gets in the car beside him

MICHAEL
I never talked one of you cops
out of a ticket in my entire life

PETE
All you have to do is look like
that
(holds up a paper)
Phone’ number

MICHAEL
You’re a lucky man

There is bitterness in Pete’s voice as he says-

PETE
Oh yeahthat’s me

As Pete pulls back out into traffic Michael checks his watch
MICHAEL

a It’s almost ten I should be
getting home
5-28-91 40

PETE
I’11 get you home But first weve
got to make a stop

EXT A BUNGALOW - NIGHT

This place is in need of repair So is this whole neighborhood

PETE’S CAR

-is parked across the street Michael is alone inside He’s
fidgety He checks his watch It’s after eleven Then he is
startled by a rap on the window

BOY
What’d he do

Michael rolls down the window to talk to this badly dressed
little kid

MICHAEL
Huh What’d who do

BOY
(points to bungalow)
Mr Pike What are you busting
him for

4 MICHAEL
don’tI don’t know

Then both Michael and the boy are startled as-
THE DOOR TO THE BUNGALOW IS THROWN OPEN
Pete shoves a man roughly out the door He calls out-

PETE
Hey Michael

As Pete shoves the man toward the car Michael gets out He’s
confused What’s going on here Who is this guy

Now Pete shouts at the kid-

PETE
Get the hell out of here

As the kid takes off running down the street Michael starts
toward Pete who is flying on adrenaline

PETE

I want you to meet an old friend
of yoursSay hello to Richie
Pike

(A

5-28-91 41

Michael is stunned by the realization that he is looking into

the eyes of the man who broke into his home

MICHAEL
You

Pete smiles as he says to the terrified Pike-

PETE
Hear that fuck faceYou’ve just
been made

Pete grabs Pike and shoves him against the side of the police
car

PETE (CONT)

We picked up one of his pals for
something unrelated He gave up
Pike here

(happily)
Now you know why I wanted you with
me tonight

(to Pike)
You broke into my friend’s home
You scared him and his pretty
wife

Now it’s Pike who is scared to death He says to Michael-

PIKE
I’m sorry man

Pete smacks Pike hard across the face as he says-

PETE

Shut the fuck upHe doesn’t want
to hear about you being sorry

He wants to kick your fucking ass
And guess what scumbagI’m
gonna let him do it

Now Pete grabs Pike and shoves him toward Michael as he shouts
excitedly-

PETE
Go on Michael Enjoy yourself

And before Michael even realizes what’s happening Pike the
man who terrified his wife comes hurtling toward him Michael’s
eyes are ablaze with anger as he says-

MICHAEL
You sonavabitch

Michael unloads a hard right and it lands on Pike’s jaw It
feels really good to hit this lowlife prick

5-28-91 42

Now Michael’s adrenalin is really pumping and he throws another
punch Then another Michael is too jacked up to notice that
Pike’s not really fighting back He’s afraid Afraid of Pete
Pete shouts to Pike

PETE
Don’t just stand there Pike I’m
not gonna shoot you

Pike takes Pete at his word and now the tide of this fight
turns Pike is one rough sonavabitch and soon he’s landing
punches that Michael doesn’t even see coming The punches are
coming faster and harder and all Michael can do is cover his
face with his arms But then suddenly the punches stop And
when Michael clears his head he sees the reason why Pete has
stepped into this fight and he’s beating the crap out of Pike
Michael is so jacked up on his own adrenalin that he doesn’t
care about the fact that this fight has become two against one
All Michael cares about is hurting the man who broke into his
home and put his filthy hands on Karen He charges Pike who
is now being held for him by Pete He belts him in the face
The he does it again Pete shouts gleefully-
PETE
Come on Michaelbreak his
fucking face

Maybe it’s Pete’s voice that brings Michael back to the shameful
reality that this isn’t a fair fight He’s thrown his last
punch

MICHAEL
That’s it Pete he’s had enough
Pete’s laugh is loud and frightening as he says-

PETE
Like hell he hasMichaelmy
friendyou said you wanted to
hurt this guy remember

MICHAEL
Yeah but-

PETE
You said that you wanted to bust
his fucking head

Pete knocks Pike’s legs out from under him He falls onto the
floor Pike is scared and so is Michael Pete seems out of
control

PIKE
i (terrified)
Please no moreno more

5-28-91 43

i PETE
© more No more you
motherfucking low-life piece of
shit

And now Pete really goes to work on Pike kicking the living
shit out of him Michael is horrified he tries to grab hold
of Pete but Pete is too frenzied to be stopped He shoves

Michael aside as he continues to destroy the screaming Pike

MICHAEL
Pete stop

PETE
(shouting)
These motherfuckers have got to
be destroyed or they keep on
comingit’s a game it’s just
a fucking game

Finally Michael can only shout-

MICHAEL
Damn it Pete Enough

Michael’s sharp tone of voice isn’t lost on Pete and now as

Pete stops kicking Pike he’s staring at Michael with that same

bone chilling intensity we’ve seen earlier Michael actually
shudders Then Pete’s stare gives way to a smile that is
actually more like a mocking smirk

wh PETE
atever you say Michael You’re
the man

Pete pulls the badly beaten Pike to his feet as Michael breathes

a sigh of relief
EXT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Michael is heading quickly for his car He’s about to get in

Booking this prick won’t take too
long Let’s grab a beer

MICHAEL -

Michael starts to get into his car Pete grabs his arm Then
he smiles broadly as he says-

PETE

MICHAEL
Yeah

Pete laughs as he points to the bloody knuckles on Michael’s
right hand

PETE
You sure did go to town on
himIt felt good too didn’t

Michael shoves his hand into his pocket as he pulls away from
Pete

MICHAEL
Goodbye Pete

Then Michael slams the car door and pulls out
INT ROBERTS’ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Karen is by the window nervously watching for Michael The

phone rings Karen’s nervousness now turns to fear as she grabs

up the phone and says hopefully-

Michael
PETE AT THE POLICE STATION - INTERCUT
Pete’s at his desk Seems very relaxed

PETE
It’s Pete Karen calm down
Michael’s fine

KAREN
Then why are you calling

PETE

I’m going to beat him to it
Karen we caught the creep who
broke into your house

KAREN

PETE
And just in case he’s too modest
to go into details let me just
tell you that your husband was
a real hero

EXT ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Michael is still rattled as he pulls into the driveway and gets
out of the car

INT ROBERTS HOUSE - NIGHT

As Karen is hanging up the phone Michael walks in Karen’s too
excited to notice that her husband looks like hell

MICHAEL
Who were you talking to

KAREN
(smiling)
Oh just Officer Pete Lane

Michael is genuinely stunned
MICHAEL

He called you What did he tell
you

“Karen throws her arms around Michael He’s trying desperately

to keep it together It isn’t easy

KAREN
Just that you were braver than
any cop he’d ever seen and that
he couldn’t have done it without
you MichaelI am so proud of
you

Michael is confused He sits down on the sofa and says more to
himself than to Karen-

MICHAEL
Why would he do that Why would
he call you up

KAREN
(she laughs)
He was afraid you’d be too modest
to tell me what a hero you were
Little does he know

Karen sits down beside Michael

5-28-91 46

KAREN
So now you’re going to tell me
all about it and don’t leave out
one single detail

Karen thinks he’s kidding but Michael’s dead serious as he
says-

MICHAEL

I don’t want to talk about it
manee
(laughing)
Oh come on Michaelof course
you do

Michael looks into Karen’s eyes It’s good to see her so happy
He’s not going to spoil it by telling her about the complicated
and shameful events of this evening He wouldn’t know how

MICHAEL
Karenall you have to know is
that the guy’s behind bars Okay
There’s nothing to be afraid of
now

Only Know does Karen realize that Michael is upset

KAREN
I’m sorry honeyI guess it was
pretty intense huh

Michael suddenly covers his bruised hand with his other hand
as he says-

MICHAEL
Yeah

The to Karen’s surprise Michael gets up and heads for the
stairs
I MICHAEL
I’ve got work to do

Michael rushes upstairs leaving the disappointed Karen alone

had been working on has been absolutely transformed into an art
deco jewel

A five piece orchestra is on a makeshift podium and the place
is filled with people eating drinking and dancing

Michael is in great spirits as he holds court among a small
cluster of guests

ANGLE - KAREN AND PENNY

They’re standing across the room with drinks in their hands
Penny a very pretty school friend of Karen’s is enjoying
herself obviously very impressed by this party But Karen
though she looks sensational in her elegant black gown seems
a little sad as she watches her husband play host She’s also
a little bit tipsy

KAREN
Michael wanted to show the place
off before it opened Get a little
buzz going as he puts it

Penny’s watching the flashbulbs go off as the paparazzi
photograph somebody famous who’s just made an’ entrance Roger

is on hand to escort them into the room and to pretend that he’s

shielding them from the press

PENNY
I’ve never seen anybody famous
up close Does Michael actually
know them

KAREN
No way They’re all Roger’s
Clients I think Michael’s giving
them one percent of the place just
to be seen here Michael’s very
smart about these things

Suddenly Penny’s eyes light up as she says-

PENNY
Oh Karenwho is that

He’s just walked in the door Pete’s suit may not be-Armani
but he looks great He smiles when he spots Karen who is
happily waving him over

KAREN
That’s Pete Our cop

Penny is definitely interested in this man

PENNY
Oh really

Pete approaches Karen says happily-

KAREN
I’m so glad you came

PETE
Thanks for inviting me That’s
really a beautiful dress

KAREN
Thank you

Penny is waiting to introduced but if she’s got to wait for
Karen to do it maybe it won’t ever happen so she gives Pete
her biggest smile as she says-

PENNY
Hi

Karen remembers her manners now

KAREN
Oh Pete this is Penny She works
at my school

PETE
Hi Penny

PENNY
Karen tells me that you’re a-

But Pete doesn’t even seem to know that Penny exists right at
this moment His attention is exclusively on Karen

PETE
I love this old music You want
to dance

Karen smiles as she takes Pete’s hand They start toward the
gance floor but Karen remembers the drink she’s got in her
hand She hands it off to her friend Penny who smiles
sardonically as she says to Karen-

fo PENNY
He’s your cop all right

Karen just laughs pretending not to know what her friend is
talking about Then she goes out onto the dance floor with Pete

ANGLE - MICHAEL AND ROGER

They’re watching Jerome Richter who is clearly enjoying
himself as he holds court and eats hours d’oeuvres

MICHAEL

I want to get a few more drinks
into him before I move in for the
kill

Roger laughs Then-
ROGER

Who’s that great looking stud

dancing with your sexy wife

Michael’s feature’s darken as he sees-
PETE AND KAREN

They look good together on the dance floor Pete is a great
dancer

Wordlessly Michael heads toward Pete and Karen He doesn’t get
far however before Jerome Richter grabs his arm and pulls him
into his circle cutting off Michael’s view of Pete and Karen
RICHTER

Michael I was just telling these

people that being from Boston

damned Celtics fans

Michael is sweating he wants to get away from these people but
he has to be polite He smiles as he says-

MICHAEL
Come on Gentlemenwho’s LA

and MacHale And the Chief is
still hanging in there
(they laugh)
Enjoy yourselves

Michael moves off from the group Michael looks around Can’t
find Pete and Karen Where did they go Finally he sees them
Talking alone in the corner As Karen spots Michael hurrying
over she says to him joyfully-
5-28-91

KAREN
Sweetheart look who’s here

Pete gives Michael a wink and a smile

PETE

MICHAEL

KAREN

PETE

Karen is referring to a couple of guests who are waving her
over As she heads off she says-

KAREN

THE BAR - SHORT TIME LATER

Michael and Pete are at the bar The bartender serves them each
a scotch Pete picks up his glass

PETE
Good luck

The two men raise their glasses and drink Then-

PETE

MICHAEL
How did you know I was up late

PETE
(laughs)
How do you think I saw the lights

MICHAEL
Listennow that Pike’s behind

MICHAEL
What do you mean

PETE
Mikeyyou’re not a virgin
anymore You saw for yourself
how much evil shit there is out
there What kind of a friend would
I be if I didn’t do what I could
to protect you from it

tone is a bit brusque but he wants to make his point-

MICHAEL
You don’t understand me What I’m
saying to you is that your
protecting us from anythingis
no longer necessary

tone isn’t lost on Pete Who lowers his drink to the

PETE

MICHAEL
Why should I be-

PETE
(chuckles)
Oh come on you did a lot of big
talking about what a tough guy

in Pike would have kicked your
ass

MICHAEL

(disbelief)
Is that what you think this is
about

PETE

a hero you were

(big smile)
She probably fucked your brains
out when you got home

MICHAEL
Listen to me-

PETE

Michael loses it now He’s raising his voice as he says-

MICHAEL
We aren’t friends

individual Are you hearing me

PETE
Lower your voice

MICHAEL
Fuck you And don’t tell me to-

5-28-91 53

Your pigeon is watching

Michael goes white as he realizes that Richter is looking at
him curiously from across the room

PETE
I hope he doesn’t fly away on
you

Michael starts off but Pete grabs his arm He smiles
malevolently as he says-

PETE

I know how lucky you are and all

butmaybe you’re not quite so

lucky as you think
Michael pulls away from Pete and heads toward Richter
EXT RESTAURANT - NIGHT
Pete waits outside as a valet opens the door to a BMW for a well
dressed couple They drive off Now up comes Pete’s shitty
Plymouth Reliant The valet seems annoyed as he gets out of the
car and holds out his hand

VALET

- Five dollars please

Pete pays the guy He’s about to get into his car when he peers
through the restaurant window He scowls as he sees-

POV - RICHTER MICHAEL KAREN AND ROGER

TERRY
(blown away)
Wow

But now Pete smiles mischievously as he says-

ee
5-28-91 55

PETE
I decided then that I’d dedicate
my life to crime fighting

Terry gets the definite feeling that Pete is putting her on
She laughs as she says-

TERRY
Yeah rightyou and Batman

PETE
You wouldn’t believe how many
women have sat right there where
you’re sitting and actually
believed that stupid story

Terry laughs but she wants to get something straight

TERRY
So your parents are alive

PETE
No

Now Terry is thoroughly confused

TERRY
I don’t-

Terry starts to play with his hair as she says sexily-

TERRY

Becauseyou are the best
PETE

The best cop you’ve fucked all

Terry’s not easily insulted She starts to kiss Pete
TERRY

Pete shakes his finger at her He means this

Pete slams the car door shut He fires up the engine and backs
out of the alley Terry is too frightened to even move

DISSOLVE INTO
PETE IN HIS DRESS BLUES

PETE
Being a cop is not about shooting

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - CLASSROOM FULL OF KIDS

Pete is sitting in a little chair eye level with the

nine-year-old kids who are absolutely enthralled Karen stands

by smiling
5-28-91 57

PETE (CONT)
«forget about what you see on
tv or in the moviesShooting
somebody is probably the worst
thing in the world I didn’t
become a cop to shoot people I
became a cop to protect then

Karen sees Pete smile at her as he speaks She returns it Pete
certainly is impressive and he’s got a real facility with these
kids who clearly adore him

EXT SCHOOL - DAY

We can see now that this is one of those upscale private
elementary schools Lots of Mercedes in the parking lot Some
kids are being picked up by chauffeurs

Karen and Pete walk toward the parking lot

KAREN
This was great I don’t know how
to thank you

PETE
How about buying me a cup of
coffee

Karen wasn’t prepared for this

KAREN

afternoon

KAREN
(laughing)

A noisy downtown watering hole for cops This is where they come

to talk shop get drunk and hit on the ample assortment of women
who come here because they’ve got a thing for cops
5-28-91 58

Though these guys are all out of uniform you could pin any of
them for cops

Pete and Karen sit at a table having coffee As Karen glances
around it is clear that this place is fun for her

KAREN
Are all of these people cops

Pete smiles and nods He figured that Karen would find this
place exotic

PETE
Welcome to Mickey’s The safest
bar in the world

Dan the young cop from the firing range comes over to the
table He’s glad to see Pete but like everybody else in this
place he’s had one too many He’s looking at Karen as he says-

DAN
How come this guy always gets the
greatest looking babes

Pete’s annoyed and slightly embarrassed

PETE
Mrs Roberts is not a babe

DAN
(confused)
OhI thought she was Sorry

Karen laughs as Dan staggers off

PETE
Maybe I shouldn’t have brought
you here It was kind of force
of habit

bn KAREN

of day

PETE
Still kind of jumpy huh

5-28-91

KAREN
(smiling)
I guess I’m jumpy in general
Michael gets annoyed with me
sometimes

There’s just a trace of resentment in Pete’s voice as he says-

PETE
For some peoplelife comes easy

KAREN
I was that way once

PETE
What happened

KAREN
oh My fatherhe just
(she laughs)
You don’t want to hear about this

PETE
Sure I do

Karen can see that Pete is attracted to her
that makes her feel

KAREN
It’s so good to have somebody to
talk to Since we moved here I’ve
felt kind of isolated you know

PETE
Tell me about your father

KAREN
He drank a lot and he died when
I was pretty young

PETE
I’m sorry

KAREN
He had everything and got bored
with it so he gambled it all
away He left my mother with a
pile of debts and life got pretty
scary I meanwe almost went
under

PETE
That’s tough

She likes the way

5-28-91 60

KAREN
See when I met Michaelhe was
like the exact opposite of my
father That’s why I married him

PETE
But you’re jumpy

KAREN
Well-

PETE

How come you don’t have any kids

Karen is surprised and slightly embarrassed by this sudden
change of subject

KAREN
When Michael decided to move us
out here and start up this
restaurant that little matter
got put on hold

PETE
(firmly)
You should have a family The way
you are with kids

A trace of resentment can now be detected in Karen’s voice

KAREN
The plan was fo6r me to stop
working after we were married for
a year That was three years ago
and now I’m beginning to worry
that

Pete is staring at her Karen realizes she is saying some very

intimate things to this man she doesn’t know that well She’s
embarrassed now

KAREN
You know we’re supposed to be
talking about you

But Pete doesn’t respond He’s just looking at Karen with a
funny expression on his face Finally she just laughs and says-

KAREN
What

Pete leans in across the table Looks into her eyes

PETE
All the things that come so easy
to Michaelwere you one of them

5-28-91 61

I don’t-

KAREN

PETE
Because there’s no man I’ve ever
met who deserved that much good
fortune

Pete’s looking into her eyes Karen smiles Then-

KAREN

Michael’s in a great mood as he drives through a residential
neighborhood singing along with a King Pleasure CD The song

James Moody sax solo But his good mood evaporates as he glances
in his rear view mirror and sees-

A POLICE CAR
It’s lights are flashing

MICHAEL
Shit

Michael glances at his speedometer He’s only doing 40 Why is
this fucking cop pulling him over

Michael pulls over and waits Soon the cop is beside him

PETE
Hi Michael

Michael only now realizes that he’s been stopped by Pete He’s
relieved and annoyed at the same time

MICHAEL

MICHAEL
Well thenwhat is it that you

MICHAEL

to ticket you

MICHAEL
You’re kidding me right

He starts to get out of the car until Pete says in a voice that
makes it clear he’s not kidding-

PETE
Keep you hands where I can see
them and turn off your engine

Michael does what he’s told but he is absolutely livid

PETE
Now hand me your license and
registration please

Michael is practically snarling as he hands them over
EXT PETE’S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER

Pete smiles as he watches Michael’s car pull out Then he gets
into his patrol car and sits beside partner Roy whos clearly
been enjoying this

ROY
Boythat little friendship sure
went south fast

It’s clear that Pete’s enjoying himself as he says-

PETE
You saw him He was driving five
miles over the speed limit

ROY
(smiling)
Uh-huhAnd what would the speed
limit have been for his wife

Roy laughs Pete doesn’t say anything and as he watches
Michael’s car disappear WE HEAR-

MICHAEL (V0)
I don’t deny that I was going a
few miles over the speed limit
Your Honor

INT TRAFFIC COURT - DAY

The place is absolutely packed It’s like everybody » in LA has
shown up today to fight their ticket

Pete sits totally expressionless as he watches Michael present
his case to the JUDGE who looks bored annoyed and impatient

Michael is calm and reasonable in his presentation Totally in-
control A regular Perry Mason

MICHAEL
-but those streets are
practically empty in the late
afternoon and so-

The judge apparently has heard enough

JUDGE
That’s enough Mr Roberts
(to Pete)
Officer Lane

Pete stands up Ramrod straight

JUDGE
(trace of sarcasm)
I know you were just doing your
job officer but come on
(holding up ticket)
Five miles over the speed limit

The many traffic violators who are waiting to have their cases
called love seeing the judge nail this cop Many of them
chuckle Toudly They want Pete to hear them

Pete doesn’t like being laughed at but there’s not much he can
do about it

PETE
You see Your Honor he-

JUDGE

like this again This is Los
Angeles for godsakes

Dismissed
MICHAEL
Thank you Your Honor
5-28-91 64

There is a smattering of applause and Michael can scarcely
contain his glee He turns from the bench and as he heads out

of the courtroom he catches Pete’s eye

Michael smiles triumphantly at Pete A real shit-eating fuck
you grin

Pete remains expressionless and the judge calls the next case

EXT HOLLYWOOD TACO STAND - DAY

It’s after traffic court and Pete is in a real bad fucking mood
as he and Roy have lunch

ROY
Come on Pete so what if he beat
it It was a bullshit ticket

anyway

Pete doesn’t respond Roy tries to keep things light but
there’s a note of concern in his voice as he says-

ROY
Dan said he saw you having a arink
with Roberts’ wife

PETE
So

ROY
Soyou pounding her

Pete regards his partner contemptuously Then he smiles cruelly
as he says-

PETE
Unlike you I do not have to pound
every woman I have a drink with
Which is why Janey left you in
case you didn’t know

i ROY
I knew

The sad look on Roy’s face clearly indicates that Pete has hit
him below the belt but Pete isn’t finished

PETE
She was a good woman but you had
to fuck it up Typical stupid
big dick cop

Roy can’t take anymore of this He says angrily-

The entire city of Los Angeles is on display from up here

INT MICHAEL’S CAR - NIGHT

Michael drives along with a look of grave determination on his
face Then he sees-

PETE’S PATROL CAR

-It’s parked on the side of the road by a cliff Pete is sitting
on the hood looking down at the city below Michael pulls up
next to Pete’s car Then he steels himself and gets out of the
car’

‘ MICHAEL

I have something for you

Pete just sits there not even looking at Michael who reaches
into his pocket and produces a check

MICHAEL
It’s for five thousand dollars
It’s all I’ve-

PETE
Sssh Listen

Michael doesn’t know what Pete’s talking about Then after a
moment he hears the distant howl of a coyote then another

Now Pete jumps down from his car He walks over to Michael

PETE

I’ve got a buddy works Beverly
Hills He told me about this lady
who was out walking her very
expensive poodle when

(laughs)
«a fucking coyote comes charging
out of the brush up North of
Sunset He snatches that poodle
right up into it’s jaws and takes
eff running All they ever found
of that rich little doggie was
a leash and a collar

This story gives Michael the creeps He holds out the check
and when Pete takes it Michael breathes a sigh of relief

MICHAEL
All that I’m askingis for you
to stay out of my business That’s
it That’s all you have to do

5-28-91 70

Pete tears up the check never taking his eyes off Michael who
is beginning to show fear

PETE
This isn’t about money I’m sure
you’re a tough guy on the golf
course but a woman needs to feel
like her man can protect her from
those coyotes coming down from
the hills

Michael gets it now Maybe he knew it all along

MICHAEL
Stay away from Karen I’m warning
you
PETE
We’ve been spending a lot of time
together

(Michael reacts)
Michael she’s scared did you
know that Scared of you losing
the business and her home-

Michael explodes He grabs hold of Pete and throws the hardest
punch he’s ever thrown in his life Unfortunately it doesn’t
connect Pete hits Michael in the stomach hard and fast
Michael sinks to his knees as Pete stands over hin

PETE
Assaulting a police officerI
gave you credit for more brains

As Michael looks up at Pete glowering down at him the possible
consequences of what he’s just done come crashing down on him

MICHAEL
What are you going to do
nowarrest me

Pete laughs out loud

PETE
Arrest you

Pete removes the gun from his holster as Michael’s eyes grow
wide with horror

PETE
A lot of cops get killed every
yearnot in the line of duty
but just cause they’re cops Makes
us kind of tense

5-28-91 7i

PETE (Cont ’d)
Makes us sometimes shoot first
and ask questions later
» (laughs)
I meanhere I wasjust minding
my own businesswhen you came
along and-

MICHAEL
(terrified)
Listen Pete-

PETE
(cruel smile)
Arrest you Michael
(beat)
I could kill you

Now Pete presses his gun against Michael’s forehead

Michael closes his eyes He’s sure this is the end of his life

He waits for the inevitable sound of the gunshot

officer A ten year vet who could-

MICHAEL
I don’t care how many decorations

a corroborating witnessyou

5-28-91 76

STEVENS (Cont’d)

mine The only people cops
believe are other cops

And Michael is out the door

GUNSHOTS

Now Pete draws his gun and starts back toward the building The

mugger rushes out Pete is waiting for him

a plain clothes detective He is in conference with some other
cops and he doesn’t even turn around as Michael starts toward
him shouting-

MICHAEL
Heywhat the hell is-

Now Miller comes up from behind Michael He grabs him and
roughly puts the cuffs on him They’re too tight Michael winces
with the pain the shock He shouts-

MICHAEL

roughly to an unmarked cop car that’s just squealed up to the
curb Michael is shoved roughly inside

Karen is hanging onto Pete If she didn’t she might pass out

Then the loud sound of GLASS SHATTERING A beautiful mirror has
been swept off the mantle and now the cop who did it OFFICER

ROSS is about to smash an expensive-looking crystal sculpture

in the shape of a pyramid Karen cries out anguished-

KAREN
Please don’t That was a wedding
presentPlease

But this cop could give a shit He’s about to smash it when Pete
grabs his arm and says-

PETE
What the hell is wrong with you
You think there’s dope inside that

INT KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Karen places the crystal pyramid on a counter top out of harm’s
way Pete hands her a glass of water She drinks it down

Karen It’ll really save a lot
of wear and tear on your house

KAREN
(anguished)
Michael doesn’t have any drugs

PETE

I know you believe that
butsuppose he did want to hide
something from youwhere might

“(she hesitates)
Karen wed be helping Michael
out

INT MICHAEL’S OFFICE - NIGHT

The cops havent tossed this room yet so the cop who stands by
the door seems hesitant to let Karen in Pete says-

PETE
It’s all right

The cop lets them pass
KAREN

This is where Michael keeps all

of his business recordsthings

like that
Karen opens the desk drawers while Pete opens a closet He
pretends to look though it but he’s watching Karen out of the
corner of his eye Waiting for her to look in-
THE SMALL FILE CABINET
-the bottom drawer to be exact

Nervously Karen pulls out the contents of each desk drawer
A bunch of documents etc No drugs

5-28-91 90

Karen breathes a sigh of relief Then she heads for the file
cabinet Pete watches as she opens one drawer Then another
Then she pulls out a small package Pete smiles to himself as
she unwraps it He waits for the inevitable-

KAREN

(gasping)
Oh

The sentry cop comes rushing over He pulls the bag which we
can now recognize as either COCAINE OR HEROIN away from Karen
who is in state of disbelief and shock

SENTRY COP
I’ll take that

PETE

(gently)
I’m sorry

Karen says nothing She can’t She just charges out of the room

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

Karen is in the waiting area It’s hot and crowded Lots of
people in trouble tonight Lots of cigarette smoke

Finally Pete comes in Karen jumps up from the bench

PETE
He isn’t here

KAREN
What Why-

PETE
On a busy night they’ll often
send prisoners downtown for
processing Look bail will be
set he’1ll post a bond and they’1l
send him home There’s nothing
you can do for him tonight

INT PETE’S CAR - NIGHT

As Karen sits beside Pete she seems dazed detached Pete must
be talking about somebody else’s husband Karen takes it all
in She is strangely fascinated

PETE
He took some heavy losses in the
market and ran into a major cash
flow problen

5-28-91 91

PETE (Cont’d)

Then when his credit went all to

hell he had to either raise some
money or lose the restaurant It

wasn’t the first time either

Michael’s not a drug dealer

PETE
Karen I’ve got some friends in
the DEA It seems that every yup
in Boston who wanted to score
good blow knew that Michael
Roberts was the man to see

KAREN
(desperately)
I know my husband

PETE

I ran a make on him I know him
better than you do

(Karen reacts)
Where do you think he got the
money to put up for the restaurant
in the first place Not to mention
the down payment for your house
The stock market Real estate

(shakes his head)
Fairy tales Karen

Karen is reeling It’s hard to take this in She’s glad that
they’re approaching her house She says weakly-

Were there

Pete pulls over in front of the house Karen reaches for the
door handle Pete grabs her hand
PETE
Getting this restaurant off the
ground meant everything to

Michael Everything But then
I guess you ew that
i
Oh my God
Karen is helpless now The shock and the pain and the

frighthave made her totally vulnerable This isn’t lost on
Pete He leans in Looks into her eyes

5-28-91 52

PETE
If I could somehow change
thingsoh KarenI swear to
God I would But all I can
dois try to protect you All
I can do is

Karen looks deep into Pete’s eyes Right now what she needs more
than anything else in the world is the protection he is
offering Protection from reality And so she lets Pete kiss
her

Their kiss is long and slow Karen is in no hurry to come back
to reality and PetePete has probably never kissed a woman
before with such intensity Soon Pete’s hands are on Karen
Finally and not without great effort Karen stops him

KAREN
Pete II’m sorryI shouldn’t
have let that happen

Pete just smiles Then he moves in again But again Karen stops
hin

KAREN
I should go in

PETE
It’s okayI know what you’re
afraid of

KAREN
(confused)
What do you mean

PETE
I want you to know something
Karenand believe me about this
now
(beat)
I don’t have to be a cop anymore-

Pete seems so intense that Karen is starting to become
frightened And just what exactly is he talking about

KAREN
tT don’t understand What-

PETE

I can do something different
something clean with my life You
don’t have to worry about me
tracking all the shit of a cop’s
life into our home every night

Fuck Michael He’s a low-life
scumbag and he’s going to get

Karen now realizes how totally she’d been taken in by Pete How
fucking crazy he is

KAREN
Everything that’s happened to

PETE
I don’t want to talk about

Karen is so angry that she forgets for the moment that Pete is
unhinged and capable of anything

KAREN
You sonavabitch You’re crazy

fucking crazy

PETE
Listen-
KAREN
No listen I love my husband

Get th at through your head and
leave us the hell alone

Karen is out of the door practically running to the house as
Pete shouts to her through the open window-

PETE
He’s never going to have you
That’s the truth Karen He is
never going to have you

But Karen’s not looking back as she rushes into her house and
slams the door shut As she leans against it her heart is
pounding It’s dawning on her now that she’s just been in the
arms of a madman and she’s afraid to even look outside Finally
she does-

5-28-91 94

PETE’S CAR

-is just sitting there The radio chatter emanating from inside

LookI‘’m sorry I haven’t gotten
back to you but-

MICHAEL
My option’s up on the building
tomorrow If I don’t have
Richter’s check deposited by then
you know what’s going to happen

ROGER
Richter’s pulling out
(Michael reacts)
Don’t act so surprised And don’t
blame me You’ve got nobody to
blame but yourself

MICHAEL
What

ROGER

You can’t possibly expect a man
like Richter to invest a
substantial amount of money with
a man who’s just been arrested
for drug dealing

MICHAEL

(amazed)
He doesn’t think I’m guilty Roger
didn’t you tell him that-

ROGER
(nervously)
All that matters is that you made
a serious error in judgementwe
both did 111 be lucky if
Richter doesn’t fire me for-

Roger doesn’t get to finish his sentence Michael grabs hin

roughly and shoves him against the wall

MICHAEL
And to think I ever thought you
were a chickenshit
Michael releases Roger Then he walks off

wife-
MICHAEL
Hang on

5-28-91 98

Michael turns the wheel hard to the right
EXT FREEWAY - NIGHT

Michael’s car suddenly swerves widely across three lanes of
freeway heading toward the rapidly approaching off ramp

Some cars come to screeching halts others have to swerve widely
to avoid smashing into the Volvo

Amazingly Michael’s car makes it across the freeway He’s
almost at the off ramp

INT MICHAEL’S CAR

Karen is holding onto the door handle for dear life and Michael
is sweating as he zooms down the off ramp But a glance in his
rear view mirror only makes his heart beat faster

PETE’S CAR

It’s somehow still right behind Michael And now-

PETE’S CAR RAMS MICHAEL’S FROM BEHIND

Michael’s car is sent hurtling down the off ramp at break neck
speed veering erratically from side to side

INSIDE MICHAEL’S CAR

Karen screams as Michael fights the wheel trying to regain
control It’s not going to happen

EXT THE STREET - NIGHT

It’s an industrial neighborhood somewhere near downtown
Deserted this time of night Michael’s car come shooting across
the intersection and goes into a skid

PETE’S CAR

-sitting in the middle of the off ramp with its lights out Now
it starts to roll slowly down the ramp Toward Michael and
Karen

A PICK UP TRUCK

-rounds the corner It stops at the crash site and THREE MEXICAN
WORKERS jump out and start to help Michael tend to Karen
Michael can’t understand a word that they’re saying but he sure
is glad to see then

MICHAEL
I think she banged her head

Michael freezes now as he sees-
PETE’S CAR

-Rolling slowly toward them But it doesn’t stop Pete just
glowers at Michael as he drives slowly past

Karen who is being helped into the truck is fighting to stay
conscious and the sound of THE POLICE RADIO CHATTER emanating
from Pete’s car is the last thing she hears before giving
herself up to the darkness

DISSOLVE INTO
INT ROBERTS BEDROOM - DAY

Karen’s got a bandage on her forehead and the right side of her
face is bruised She stirs in her sleep Reaches over for
Michael He’s not there Just Tiny the cat She opens her eyes

Seems a bit disoriented

Then she hears something Tough to make it out at first But
soon it becomes unmistakable and Karen is seized by a wave of
dread and nausea -

It is the squawking sound of a POLICE RADIO coming from
somewhere inside the house

INT HALLWAY - DAY

Karen makes her way slowly down the stairs Over the crackling
sounds of radio static she can hear the police dispatcher’s
voice giving out codes and addresses to cops taking
calls211’s 460’s 261’s And cops calling in code 7’s code
30’s etc

The radio noise is coming from inside the kitchen Karen moves
toward the door as though she were being pulled inexorably
toward her fate

INT KITCHEN DAY

KAREN
Pete

But it isn’t Pete It’s Michael He’s listening intently to A
POLICE RADIO that’s sitting atop the kitchen table Michael’s
scribbling notes as he listens He refers to a book of police
codes

The radio squawks over this entire scene

KAREN
Michaelwhat-

MICHAEL

(concerned)
What are you doing up The doctor
wants you off your feet

Karen sits down She’s obviously weak and probably wondering
if she’s dreaming

KAREN
I’m okay

MICHAEL
Karen you should-

KAREN
What are you doing Where did you
get that

MICHAEL
You can get anything in Los
Angeles

KAREN
But why

MICHAEL
(excited)
Did you hear that The cop just
went code 7that means he’s
going out of his car for a meal
(points to code book)

KAREN
(shudders)
I thought it was

l MICHAEL
(smiling)
Our friend’s on the other end of
town on a felony hit and run

5-28-91 101

MICHAEL (Contd)
(taps the radio)
This thing’s not exactly state
of the artbut if I listen hard
enoughI can make out just
‘ enough to suit my purposes

KAREN
You bought this thing so that you
can keep tabs on Pete

MICHAEL
He almost got us killed You
realize that
KAREN

What has that got to do with-

But Michael’s said all he wants to on this subject and now he
gets up and takes Karen’s hand as he helps her up from her chair
and starts walking her toward the door

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
The room is still a bit disheveled from the police search

MICHAEL
Karen you really should be in
bed How about if I bring you
up something to eat

KAREN
(wearily)
Maybe later

Karen starts back up the stairs Michael watches her go The
he returns to the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Michael picks up the police radio and goes out the door
EXT HOLLYWOOD TACO STAND - NIGHT

This is the place Pete took Michael to the night they caught
the burglar There’s Rosa the girl who mistook Michael for a
cop She’s sharing a plate of fries with a large scuzzball of
a guy who looks like he’s in a shitty mood twenty-four hours
a day

ANGLE - MICHAEL IN HIS CAR

He’s parked across the street Watching He’s more than nervous
he’s scared to death but if he’s going to pull this off he’s
going to have to keep it together Finally he gets out of the
car He heads across the street He sits down next to Rosa

(

5-28-91 102

MICHAEL
Remember me

The girl looks him over She shakes her head

ROSA
No

This is going to be tougher than Michael thought He forces a
laugh as he says-

MICHAEL
What do you mean you-

The large scuzzball whose name is CASEY is snarling at Michael
as he says-

CASEY
What the fuck do you want Huh

What Michael wants is to get the hell out of here alive Then
Rosa laughs as she says-

ROSA
Oh yeahyou’re that cop
Casey’s attitude changes instantly

CASEY
Oh shitListen officer-

Michael knows he’s got the advantage He’s got to press it

MICHAEL
Shut the fuck up You got a
problem with cops

CASEY
No

ROSA
(enjoying this)
You blew it big time Casey

MICHAEL
(to Rosa)
Beat it

The girl laughs as she goes off and Michael turns back to
Casey who Michael knows will probably bite his head off if he
screws this up He steels himself and gives Casey a Pete Lane
line-

«

5-28-91 103

MICHAEL
Listen to me Caseywe can be
friends or I can fuck you up
Which is it

CASEY
(shaking his head)
You copsyou guys kill meWhat

Casey looks Michael over Michael’s sweating His heart is
pounding through his chest

EXT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

This is the warehouse with the old security guard who calls in
false alarms so he can hang out with Pete when he’s lonely

Michael’s car drives slowly up the street marked INDUSTRIAL
PLACE toward the warehouse Then about fifty yards before the
warehouse Michael cuts his lights and turns off the road He
parks behind the rusted-out hulk of an old truck where he’s
hidden from view

INT MICHAEL’S CAR - NIGHT

Michael turns on the police radio that sits in the seat beside
him The police dispatcher’s voice crackles through Then he
reaches into his pocket and pulls out-

A SMALL CALIBER GUN

Michael places it on top of the radio Then as he gazes toward
the warehouse he mutters-

MICHAEL

MICHAEL
I gotta get some sleep Karen
Please
KAREN

Our whole lives are falling apart
and you’re acting crazy I know
that you don’t like doing it but
you are going to have to talk to
me

Michael looks at Karen He smiles sadly because he knows that
she’s right

MICHAEL

I found out what Pete was like
the night we caught the
burglarI should have told you
right then

KAREN
Why didn’t you

MICHAEL
Because to do thatI’d have to
have told you what I was like
(hard for him)
I let Pete hold that guy for me
while Ihit him

Michael-

MICHAEL
But it was too important for me
that you felt safethat you felt
I could protect youSo I let
you believe Pete’s lie about what
a hero I was

Michael-

Michael takes his wife in his arms now as he says with great
passion and intensity-
5-28-91

MICHAEL
But I can protect you Karen I
ean

Karen is really frightened She’s almost afraid to ask the
question she already knows the answer to-

KAREN
What are you planning to do

MICHAEL

KAREN

can move back to Boston

MICHAEL
I’m not allowed to leave the

Because he’s got it in his head
that he wants you Karenand

INT MICHAEL’S CAR - NIGHT

Once again Michael’s parked behind the truck He’s straining
to hear the dispatcher’s voice over the static Then he hears
the call that he’d been waiting for - a possible two-eleven at
113 Industrial Place

Michael’s trying to remain calm It isn’t easy He shuts off
the radio Grabs the gun from out of the glove compartment Gets
out of the car and heads toward the wall of rusted barrels near
the warehouse

INT THE WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Jess has got the coffee going as he sets up a chess board

EXT WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Michael’s eyes are riveted on the road Finally he hears a car
in the distance Soon he can see-

THE POLICE CAR ROLLING UP
It stops near the warehouse The door opens
MICHAEL

In this darkness it is impossible for him to see Pete’s face
He wishes he could as he aims his gun

PETE

-is walking up the road He’s whistling His gun isn’t drawn
He knows there’s no burglar here He approaches the door

Michael is behind Pete now He drives his gun down on top of
his head Down he goes Michael stands over him shouting-

f y

5-28-91 108

MICHAEL
Turn around

The cop turns around Michael is stunned as he realizes that it

isn’t Pete after all It’s-
YOUNG DAN
- who is dazed and scared to death

DAN
Don’t kill me please

Michael’s anger outweighs his fear as he shouts-

MICHAEL
Where’s Pete Lane 1

DAN
(terrified)
I dropped him off at your place

Michael’s blood runs cold He grabs Dan’s gun and throws it
into the bushes Then he heads down the road toward his car
He gets in and goes roaring off

Dan gets to his feet He’s dazed but okay He heads off to look

for his gun

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Karen is setting a bowl of food down for Tiny Then she suddenly
becomes uneasy here alone in the dark kitchen She’s remembering
that this is where the burglar broke in She wants to look up

at the skylight but she’s afraid of what she might see Finally
she does

THE SKYLIGHT
-it’s closed securely and all in one piece
Karen’s feeling a little bit better as she leaves and then as
she’s about to walk through the door she seems something that
she is totally unprepared for-
A VASE FILLED WITH ROSES
-sitting atop the kitchen table

KAREN

(happily)

MichaelMichael where are you

Karen rushes over and smells the roses Then-

Michael

No answer Karen begins to get the feeling that something could
be wrong here Then she hears music playing faintly Charlie
Parker on the sax It’s coming from the living room Karen
starts to head toward the door that opens to the living room

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
Karen steps inside The room is dark The stereo is playing
KAREN
Michaelwhat are you doing in
here

Karen hits the lights She nearly jumps out of her skin as she
sees-

PETE SITTING IN MICHAEL’S CLUB CHAIR

He seems very comfortable Like he’s trying on the chair the
musicthis whole room - trying them on for size He likes the
way they fit

PETE
Aren’t you going to ask me how
my day went

5-28-91 120

KAREN
How did you get in here

Pete laughs He gets out of the chair as he says-

PETE
You’re kidding me right

Karen turns and runs Pete catches up with her in the hall
Grabs her arm She screams-

KAREN
Let me go

PETE
Were going to wait here for
Michael and then-

Karen manages to squirm away from Pete She’s off and running
Heading for the stairs Pete goes after her

PETE
Karen Karen

Karen rushes up the stairs and into the bedroom about two steps
ahead of Pete She slams the door shut

INT BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Karen is petrified She doesn’t know what to do and she doesn’t
have too much time to think about it because suddenly the door
is kicked right down There stands Pete He walks in slowly
Corners Karen against the wall Looks into her eyes as he says
quite gently-

PETE

He’s not going to have you Karen
I told you that

KAREN
Leave me aione Pete Please

Before Pete can reply he and Karen hear THE SOUNDS OF A CAR
SCREECHING UP AND THE DOOR BEING SLAMMED

INT LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Michael bursts in through the front door He’s got his gun
drawn Nobody there Then on the stairs he sees-

PETE AND KAREN

Pete’s got Karen in front of him shielding him from Michael

Pete’s got his arm across the terrified Karen’s breasts- holding

her just like Pike the burglar
o

—

5-28-91 111

PETE
(to Karen)
Hey honey look who’s here
MICHAEL
Let her go

Pete and Karen come down the stairs into the living room

PETE
Hey MikeyI’m unarmed
MICHAEL
(calmly)
Let her go

Now from behind Karen’s back Pete produces the gun that had
been hidden from Michael’s view Michael sees it just fine now
but it’s too late to do anything about it

Pete smiles as he fires Hits Michael in the shoulder

Michael’s gun drops Karen screams She breaks free from Pete
and rushes over to Michael

Pete picks up Michael’s gun Puts it in his pocket Really
enjoying himself

PETE
You fucked up Mikey A trained
professional would have put a
bullet through my head

Karen is crying now afraid that Pete is going to kill Michael

KAREN
Leave him alone I’11 do anything
you want please

MICHAEL
(sharply)
Karen-

PETE
I am going to tell you what I
want
(points)
I want that chair

Karen and Michael are astonished What
PETE

want my chairmoved right over
ere

wH

5-28-91 112

PETE (Cont’d)
(to Michael)
Will you move it for me Mikey
And don’t get any blood on it
please

Michael is snarling but Karen clearly wants him to comply
Michael is in terrible pain from his shoulder wound and lifting
a chair is not exactly what the doctor ordered but he does what
he’s told Then-

PETE
That’s what I want Michael me Te

That’s what I want from you
At that moment everybody is startled as-
DAN RUSHES IN WITH HIS GUN DRAWN

DAN
(to Michael)
Okay fucker put your hands on
your head

Though he’s here to arrest Michael it looks to Dan like Pete
has got the situation well under control He smiles

DAN
I should have known you could
handle his sorry ass

Nobody is prepared for what happens next

Pete turns his gun from Michael as he sneers disgustedly-
- PETE

Fucking copswhy aren’t you out
arresting criminals or
something

Pete shoots Dan right in the chest and down he goes

Michael and Karen can’t believe their eyes and now once again
Pete points the gun at Michael

PETE
I have decidedthat I don’t want
to be a cop anymore I want to
-work in an officeSome kind of
an office where I will be treated
with respect Not because I wear
a badgebut because I’m a
goddamned human being

Pete points now to the cop on the floor He shakes his head
and what he says now he says with profound sadness

oo Bare

5-28-91 113

PETE
Look at himit almost looks like
human blood

(to Michael)
I can understand why you wanted
to kill him

MICHAEL
(confused)
What are you

PETE
But you know what happens to cop
killers

Pete aims at Michael He fires Karen screams-

KAREN
No

The bullet flies right past Michael’s ear Pete missed him
intentionally but not by much

As Karen looks on in horror Michael begins to back up out of
the living room into the kitchen

INT KITCHEN CONTINUOUS
Pete advances slowly as he talks

PETE
You knew that Karen and I had been
seeing each other So did
everybody in my precinct

MICHAEL
You can’t-

PETE
There we were spending a quiet
evening together when you came
charging in You managed to get
my gun away just as poor Danny
showed up and you drilled hin
I jumped you We fought for the
gun and some shots were fired

Pete fires at Michael again Just missing

KAREN
Stop it pleaseplease

PETE
You put up a hell of a fight
MikeyYoure

oN

5-28-91 114

PETE (Cont’d)
a pretty strong guy
(smiles)
Or maybe it was the drugs

Pete aims at the ceiling Shoots the newly repaired skylight
Glass rains down on Michael

PETE
Finally you had just one bullet
leftand that’s when I got the
gun back

Michael is dazed and bloody His hatred for Pete far overwhelms
his fear

MICHAEL
You can’t get away with
thisKaren’s here She’ll tell
the police-

PETE
(laughs)
What That I killed Dan

Pete turns to Karen now who is shuddering in the corner of the
kitchen

PETE
They won’t believe you So you’re
going to have to make a decision
Karen You’re either with me or
against me

Karen seems frozen with terror Pete smiles at her as he holds
out his hand and says-

PETE
Come here to me now

Now as WE HEAR the WAIL OF POLICE SIRENS in the distance Karen
begins to walk slowly toward the smiling Pete

MICHAEL
(shouting)
Don’t-

But Karen keeps coming Pete takes her hand

PETE
I need you to kiss me KarenI
need for Michael to see you kiss
me Like you did that night in
my car

This startles Michael Pete sees it
58-91 115

PETE
Relax MichaelI never fucked
your wife
(looks at Karen)
But I’m going to
(then)
Goodbye Michael

Pete is about to pull the trigger when Karen who we realize
now has just been waiting for her chance suddenly reaches out
and grabs-

THE CRYSTAL PYRAMID

- that she’d left sitting on the counter top the night the cops
searched the house And before Pete knows what’s happening
Karen plunges the pointed end of the sculpture into his
shoulder Pete screams

Michael doesn’t waste a moment Weakened though he is his body
is shot through with adrenalin He feels no pain feels no fear
as he springs at Pete and drives his knee right into Pete’s
groin Pete drops the gun and goes down

Michael is all over Pete pummeling him mercilessly turning
his face into a battered bloody mess until finally Karen
screams-

KAREN
Michael stop

But Michael can’t even hear her He stands over Pete now Shoves

the gun into Pete’s ear

MICHAEL
One bullet left Isn’t that right
officer Lane

As Michael cocks the gun the CLICK of its hammer makes Karen
turn away

A gun is fired But it isn’t the one in Michael’s hand
ANGLE - DAN THE COP

- Standing in the doorway He’s definitely in bad shape as he
tries to stop his bleeding with one hand while holding his gun
in the other His warning shot went into the ceiling But now
his gun is trained on Pete

DAN
(to Michael)
Move away from him please

The shot has brought Michael back to reality He lets Pete
And moves away from him to Karen
5-28-91 ‘ 116

Now Dan says to Pete in a voice that is weak from both shock
and sadness-

DAN
Officer Laneyou’re under
arrest

The sirens that we heard in the distance are now right outside
the door

EXT THE HOUSE - NIGHT
OVER THE FOLLOWING SCENE WE HEAR-
DAN’S VOICE as he continues the Miranda Law recitation

DAN (V0)
You have the right to remain
silent You have the right to
an attorney If you cannot afford
an attorney etc

Three police cars are on the scene and the neighbors are out
in force Dan is being helped into an ambulance by cops and
paramedics

The handcuffed Pete is being he’s led toward one of the patrol
cars There’s nothing the cops hate worse than a cop gone so
bad he’d actually shoot another cop a fact which probably
accounts for their less than gentle treatment of Pete as they
take him away

ANGLE - MICHAEL AND KAREN
Standing off to the side watching Pete being taken away Just
before Pete is shoved into the car he looks at Michael and
Karen The three of them lock eyes Then Pete disappears inside
the patrol car
A nearby cop gets a glimpse of Michael’s shoulder wound

CoP

Maybe you should go with the

ambulance

MICHAEL
My wife will drive me

Michael puts his good arm around Karen Then they start slowly
toward their car

FADE OUT
THE END
