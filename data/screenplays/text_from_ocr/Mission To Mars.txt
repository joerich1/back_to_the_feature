pit barbecue where other ASTRONAUTS are gathered Cote
paused here too distributing the last of her beers
KIROV a Russian cosmonaut is watching some kids
they play a game of wiffle ball He turns grinning
at the chef
KIROV

Hey Woody our Mars One crew wont

be heading back to Earth till ten

days after you guys land at our base

WOODY
What are you suggesting Sergei

KIROV
Maybe you should bring a baseball
bat Yes American baseball Our two
crews could have ourselves a little
Solar System Series

WOODY
Please Half you guys are foreigners
Wed crush you

KIROV
No no we have equal crews Three
men one woman Same handicap

He grins teasingly at Cote who makes a face at him
WOODY
Easy now youre talking about my

And Terri just happens to be one
helluva shortstop

DR TERRI FISHER early 30s passes by with a platter
corn-on-the-cob Short sturdy body a face made

by its alert questing intelligence She pauses to kiss
Woodys cheek theres a wonderful sexy spark between

Then she glances at Kirov all business now
TERRI

want any peace at all on Mars Two
Im gonna be saying a lot of Yes

The others laugh

ANGLE FOLLOWS TERRI as she dodges a PACK OF KIDS --
by her shrieking happily - before she finally reaches
picnic table where ASTRONAUTS WIVES are opening

of baked beans coleslaw and potato salad

1ST WIFE
jJust not sure how I feel about
NASA allowing couples to go on this
type of mission together

One of the other women raises a warning eyebrow and
Wife turns sees Terri setting down her platter

1ST WIFE
(embarrassed)
Nothing personal Terri Its just
that well its kind of a funny
feeling for those of us staying
behind

restless intellect of a scientist Hes unaware of her

approach until she touches his shoulder He looks at
her

with an apologetic smile

DEBRA
Hes not coming Luke

LUKE
Jim deserves this too All his

In the back corner of the yard where its quieter he
Willis whos sitting on a blanket murmuring soulfully
PRETTY GIRL 2
WILLIS

Deep space is so lonesome So cold

on a tripod He looks lonely
Luke climbs up sits down on the wooden deck next to

Then every night wherever I am
Ill read a little bit more of it
And Ill know that you and Mommy

still reading it together Cause I
dont know about you but Im pretty
anxious to find out how ol Ben Gunn
got marooned on that island What
dyou say

Bobby manages a smile He nods feeling a little
Luke is proud of his sons courage

LUKE
Good deal Can I have a hug

Bobbys arms go around his fathers neck He hugs Luke
fiercely and Luke hugs him back His eyes over the

young shoulders are brimming with love and impending
Then from the distance the sound of an APPROACHING
They both turn

An open Jeep is coming down the street Its DRIVER is

Lukes expression changes Recognition then happiness
EXT LUKES STREET LATE AFTERNOON

The Jeep stops its electric engine WHIRRING down The

JIM MCCONNELL early 40s manages a smile in return He

dark circles under his eyes and his clothes look slept

Yet we sense even through his sadness a kind of quiet
competence in this man an unforced authority hes a

leader
Debra hurries forward into his arms and he hugs her
separate looking at each other Her eyes are shining

DEBRA
We were afraid you wouldnt come

MCCONNELL
I caught a whiff of your barbecue
After that I was helpless

DEBRA
All the way out in Galveston

MCCONNELL
Something like that

DEBRA

Over her shoulder he sees Luke approaching his arm
Bobby The two men look at each other the bond between

behind him arms around his waist is PRETTY GIRL 3
zoom away through the darkened neighborhood
EXT BACK YARD NIGHT
The yard is nearly deserted The Bon Voyage banner
torn loose at one end and flutters limply Here and
napkin blows across the ground
In the distance THREE FIGURES sit on the ground by
waning fire of the barbecue pit sipping beers
CLOSER ON THIS TRIO
As Woody shoves another piece of wood into the flames
moment he McConnell and Luke are silent staring at
sparks as they rise towards the stars -- red and gold
mingling with the silver ones
WOODY
(abruptly)

I wish we were all going Together
The intensity in his voice surprises the others and
Woody himself Luke glances at McConnell An awkward

LUKE

Then youve got a short memory Think

back to how we were by the second

week of lunar training

WOODY
Oh youre not gonna bring that up
again --

LUKE
(laughing)
Im trying to remember lets see
which one of us scored the lowest
ranking up there

WOODY
You just cant let that go --

LUKE
Oh man three commanders on the
same ship If they sent us off to
Mars together there wouldnt be
enough fuel to lift all those egos

WOODY
(laughs)
Bullshit we wouldve made a great
crew

MCCONNELL
That was never gonna happen I was
always teamed with Maggie and we
were mostly chalkboard jockies You
know Systems Payloads

LUKE
Listen to him Mr Cover-of-Time
Magazine

WOODY
Yeah who landed the crippled Block
II Shuttle

LUKE
Yeah and who scored highest on the
lunar rankings

WOODY
Let it go Luke

MCCONNELL

(smiles)
Sure I made a little noise But
putting the first footprints on Mars
Nah Thats for guys who

(looks at Luke)

wrote their PhD thesis on how

to colonize the place And guys who

McConnell

them

Corvette

(looks at Woody)
read too much science fiction as
a kid and still wear little Flash
Gordon rocketships around their necks
He grabs playfully at Woodys neck Woody smacks his
away laughing
WOODY
You read the same damn science fiction
books that I did Youre just not
man enough to wear jewelry
He pulls from his shirt a little Flash Gordon
emblem hanging on a chain and waggles this tauntingly
McConnell as Luke and McConnell laugh
WOODY
You want Flash You know you want
him Well youll have to come through
me

Luke grabs Woodys arm to give McConnell a better shot

the emblem but Woody cuffs his hands away laughing
McConnell watching their horseplay shakes his head

MCCONNELL

God she wouldve loved to see you

two clowns Just one more time
He tries to smile but his face reddens Then all at
his chest is heaving as he struggles to control his
Woody sees this reaches out a reassuring hand but
shakes him off rises abruptly He turns his back on
walking away a few steps
Woody and Luke exchange a worried glance
EXT LUKES STREET LATER THAT NIGHT

McConnell and Luke watch as Woody starts up his

McConnell has regained his composure
into

silence

We

this

still

LUKE
Hey Woodrow isnt it about time
you donated this thing to a museum

Woody revs the engine which ROARS lustily He grins

WOODY
Internal combustion boys Accept no
substitutes

Luke laughs Woody looks at McConnell

WOODY
Jim if theres ever if theres
anything Terri and I can do --

MCCONNELL
Im okay Really Thanks

Woody reaches out to shake Lukes hand

WOODY
See you when I get to Mars Luke
Dont solve all the mysteries of the
universe okay Leave a little
something for the next guys

LUKE
Ill see what I can do Just make
sure you bring some fresh beer

WOODY
You got it

With a final glance at McConnell Woody slips the car

gear McConnell and Luke watch as he drives away A

Luke glances at his old friend growing more serious

sense hes been waiting all night for a chance to say

McConnell

LUKE
Shouldve been your mission Jim
Yours and Maggies

looking after Woodys car becomes very

LUKE
None of us ever wanted Mars the way
you two did Not even Woody Twelve
years of hoping for this assignment
training for it --

MCCONNELL
Thats all over now

LUKE
If Maggie hadnt gotten sick -- if
you hadnt pulled yourself out of
the rotation to take care of her --

McConnell turns to him his eyes flashing danger He
will
not tolerate pity Luke sees this but presses on

LUKE

No Im gonna say this I have to
say it

(pause)
I wanted Mars One Hell I battled
you for it every step of the way
Never wanted to beat anybody so bad
in my life But not like this
Jim Id give this all up in a second
if it would bring Maggie back to us

McConnell is deeply moved and for a moment doesnt
trust
his own voice

MCCONNELL
I know that Luke You dont have to
say it Mars is yours now Go get
it

LUKE
(pause)
Take care of yourself

MCCONNELL
Yeah You too

Luke nods They grab hands for a second then let go
Luke
walks back towards his house McConnell watches him for

moment then turns walks over to his Jeep He opens
his
door then pauses He turns Looks up at --

EXT NIGHT SKY
A tiny reddish dot hovers there glowing steadily Mars

itself a tantalizing prize But for him now more
distant

than ever For him perhaps never to be attained

CLOSE ON MCCONNELLS FACE

As we see these thoughts going through him After a
moment
he looks down at

HIS SHOES
And the sandy verge of the front yard

MCCONNELLS EYES

Are a map of complex emotions regret injured pride
infinite

yearning Gently a bit self-consciously HE LIFTS ONE

EXT MARS TIU VALLIS DAY

A one-man ATV ROVER waits in the background in a dry
streambed as Luke in an EVA spacesuit swings a

rock hammer against a multi-layered sedimentary rock
Reddish dust coats his bulky white suit Despite that
he moves easily in the light Martian gravity (13

A hunk of rock breaks off and Luke examines it more

holding it up to his clear faceplate Hes very happy
absorbed in this work when his RADIO CRACKLES

INT MARS ONE HAB DAY

The crew of Mars One - Kirov Willis and Cote -- have
Luke gathered around some display monitors Theyre in

jumpsuits the Hab has artificial atmosphere enhanced
gravity and heat All are captivated by what they see

VIDEO SCREEN
We see a low-angle image of an elongated rubble and
covered MOUNTAIN Hard to tell scale but it looks

Whats most striking however is a WHITE PEAK barely
protruding through the rubble two-thirds of the way

the mountains ridgeline Its whiteness is in clear

to the typical rust-orange of the surrounding rubble
more this strange little peak also displays an oddly-
multi-planed symmetry

LUKE
What the hell is that

COTE
No idea boss

LUKE
Where is it

Cote glances at the others Theyre all smirking as
share some secret joke Lukes not yet in on

WILLIS
You dont wanna know

LUKE
Cmon whats so funny Gimme the

He leans over to read a digital gauge but Cote covers

with her hand enjoying the tease

COTE
Latitude 41 degrees north longitude
9 degrees west

LUKE
The Plains of Cydonia So
(pause)
Oh no Youre not telling me --

They all laugh as the other shoe drops Lukes
incredulous exasperated

COTE
Oui Exactement Its Kirovs fault
he picked todays sector

KIROV
Hey cmon Weve got a scientific
duty to check that thing out

Luke sits taking over the Ares remote control from
They all watch as he fine tunes the image trying
success to coax more resolution
LUKE
Great Thats great The first anomaly

we hit and its gotta be in the one
place guaranteed to make NASA look

ridiculous You know how many books
have been written about that damned
mountain

COTE

The Egyptians put it there
KIROV
No the Amazons

WILLIS
No it was little green men

LUKE
And all because a couple of lousy
impact craters happen to look like
eye sockets If this gets out well
have every UFO kook on Earth spouting
off on the six oclock news Cmon
people gimme a read here Is that a
cinder cone

KIROV
Nah too smooth Too angular Volcanic
upwelling

COTE

No fissures No caldera
LUKE
Its an upwelling for sure But

maybe not volcanic

The others look at him puzzled Luke leans in closer

with
growing excitement He points to the screen
LUKE
Look at the color And see how shiny
it is I could swear thats ice
COTE
This far south
WILLIS
Impossible You cant have ice at
this latitude Not unless
They look at each other Lukes excitement now leaping
from
one to another of them Theyre almost trembling

Ah no This is as close as he gets

ON THE SCREEN
Luke and his crew have finished eating and are
away their dishes and leftovers

LUKE
anyway thats about it Well
send another packet when we get back

Cote clears her throat gives Luke a look The others
barely conceal their grins

LUKE
Oh right One more thing Today is
a very special day for a good friend
of ours and I know hes there right
now

McConnell looks at the screen worried Whats Luke up

LUKE
Now he hates it when any fuss is
made so I wont mention his name

A look of relief comes over McConnell

because the last thing in the
world Id ever want to do is embarrass
someone like Jim McConnell

McConnell winces -- Dear God no -- as on the screen
appears from OFF CAMERA holding a cupcake with a
candle stuck in it and the Mars One crew starts
Happy Birthday to him Loudly And very off-key

LUKE
Cmon you Micker weasels sing

Soon most everyone in MMCR is singing along -- even
the jolly ambassadors -- with the noticeable exception
Beck who stiffens unhappily McConnell is mortified
LUKE
(sings a line then
to CAMERA )
Hey Ray Take a look at him Is he
all red with one of those fake Im-
a-good-sport grins
Beck looks over at McConnell who indeed is red in the
with a fake Im-a-good-sport grin
LUKE
And hey you guys check out Ray
Does he have on one of his This-
wasnt-in-my-mission-plan faces

Indeed Becks smile is thin sour disapproving

LUKE
Nothing you can do about it Ray
Were a hundred million miles away
Luke and the crew finish singing the song Luke raises

cupcake in a toast

LUKE
Happy Birthday Jimbo Make a wish

He and his crew lean in blow out the candle They
applaud then wave goodbye

LUKE
Catch you again soon Take care

LUKE
Well Whats under there

Je ne sais pas I I think theres
something wrong with the equipment

What

COTE
I mean it cant be right It says
it says theres metal under there

Luke doesnt understand He walks up to look at the

Theres ten twelve meters of rubble
and sand and then solid metal

LUKE
That doesnt make any sense Youre
reading a vein of ore

Flips a switch on the radar gun then swivels its
slowly across the near slope of the mountain We hear

feel the radar signal The immediate result is that the
pulsing tone weve been hearing suddenly stops

LUKE
Looks up from the display screen A puzzled expression

LUKE
Why did that stop

A split-second later he gets his answer We hear a

a mighty rushing of wind as

A GIGANTIC TRANSLUCENT CYLINDER

Starts to swirl and rise straight up from the top or
mountain at its center As it swirls the cylinder
debris -- pebbles sand -- from the sediment-encrusted
of the slopes

THE FOUR ASTRONAUTS

Stare up at this spectacle awed A cyclone Some kind
energy wave They have no idea At the moment theyre
fascinated to even be scared

TILTING UP - FROM THEIR POV

We see the whirling cylinder rise higher and higher
perfectly straight until in just moments its as tall

skyscraper As it rises it gains speed and power

at its top into a conical vortex Its sucking up so
dirt so many rocks -- even small boulders now -- that
accumulating debris begins to darken its swirling
outer skin

THE ASTRONAUTS
Exchange amazed glances Cant believe their eyes

McConnell still hovers by the microphone

MCCONNELL

Honestly Luke if you guys dont
have anything better to do with your

Luke and Willis turn running as hard as they can

Snatched up by the wind then swept past him ina
blur arms and legs flailing mouth open in a silent
as he vanishes

THE GROUND AT LUKES FEET

Abruptly opens and he slides into a fissure
frantically with his gloved hands he manages to
arrest his fall gripping the edge of the fault line
his helmet and one elbow thrust over its lip The air
almost solidly choked with debris deadly boulders
over him and torrents of cascading sand are burying
alive

CLOSE ON LUKE

Barely conscious as he watches for a horrifying final
instant as

rubble is a structure resembling a vast humanoid Face

The surface is gleaming white apparently metallic The

features are suggested by intricately interlocking

slopes ramps The eyes -- hatches of some kind --
are

closed and the overall expression is eerily calm but

terrible in its power like some ancient tribal mask

by huddling in tense conferring knots or muttering
feverishly into microphones

On the center screen a giant image of Mars A frantic
of green numbers crawls above and below this and the
of the Mars One Base Camp is marked in blinking red
WOODY AND HIS CREW

Are staring up at this screen appalled McConnell and
stand nearby briefing them

BECK
Then at 1417 the X-band continuous
data stream from Mars went silent
All data -- med environmental
everything -- suddenly stopped While
we were trying to figure out what
the hell went wrong we got a signal
from the folks at the Large Array at
Soccoro

MCCONNELL
At the same moment we lost the data
stream they picked up an intense
burst of energy from Mars

WOODY
What do you mean intense
MCCONNELL
(hesitates)
Catastrophic

Looks are exchanged among the Mars Two crew

TERRI
What about the crew

BECK
The level of energy in the pulse
didnt seem survivable

WOODY
What about the REMO It went into
Mars orbit last week Maybe that
could give us some clue

MCCONNELL
Good thinking Woody Thats just
what we tried next
He leans over punches buttons on a keyboard

Mars

leaving a glowing electronic trail This dot gets

In an otherwise empty lounge the astronauts clutch
coffee cups Beck stands nearby Through a large
behind them stars glitter against the inky blackness

BECK
If this was a earthquake as were
now assuming theres usually an
auditory component

WOODY
But that energy pulse they picked up
in New Mexico
PHIL
Electromagnetic emission Not uncommon
with large-scale geophysical
phenomena

WOODY

(incredulous)
Causing this kind of damage I dont
buy it Were missing something here

McConnell and Woody exchange a glance Woodys right

TERRI
Luke must be in pretty bad shape if
he hasnt blasted out of there in
the Earth Return Vehicle That things
designed so even one crew member
could fly it back to Earth

MCCONNELL
Even if Luke was in great shape he
couldnt get home That energy pulse
wouldve fried the ERVS computers

WOODY
Other than the computers how do we
think the ERV fared

BECK
Well so far our modelling says it
should be in pretty good shape

WOODY
Which means its gonna be up to us
to get new motherboards drives and
software to Mars As fast as we can

McConnell looks at him nods Theyre on the same
wavelength
But Beck is more cautious

BECK
Whoa slow down Its gonna take us
weeks just to analyze this data

MCCONNELL
Right but meanwhile weve gotta be
working up a mission plan

WOODY
Luke needs us now
BECK
Luke may already be dead And even
if hes not its doubtful hes going
to be able to transmit again So we
wouldnt know whether its safe to
land until you were almost there

PHIL
What about SIMA

Terri looks at Phil -- SIMA

PHIL
The Saturn Imaging Probe Its going
to slingshot around Mars on its way
through the solar system It could
be retasked to take pictures read
radiation levels at Mars One Base
Camp

WOODY
Good idea Phil If SIMA tells us
Luke hasnt survived and its not
safe to land we swing around Mars
and come right back home

MCCONNELL
Yes We can design the mission to
have a free return capability Its
a long trip but if you dont land
its the best option

BECK
Were getting ahead of ourselves
Youre forgetting the bigger problem
(they look at him)
The orbits are all wrong Our first
decent launch window is almost eight
months from now

MCCONNELL
But we can go earlier and get there
faster if we reconfigure the payload
for extra fuel Weve modelled that
Ray Ive modelled it

BECK
On paper yeah But those stresses
have never been tested in space

MCCONNELL
The ship can take it

BECK
I wasnt thinking of just the ship

A tense beat Again we sense the test of wills between
these

two tough-minded men once good friends

MCCONNELL
I know the protocols for a Mars
Recovery Mission better than anybody
because I helped design them And
Im saying these guys can do it

WOODY
Hes right Ray Weve got a real
shot

A pause with beck weighing the odds He looks at Woody
BECK
Give me an updated mission plan by
0800 tomorrow Then Ill put it in

the works

Bjornstrom is a geologist Hes good
but not for this My people just
lost eight months of training This

different objective

I havent been given authorization
for a mission yet

But when you are it ought to be
given the best chance for success I
want McConnell to fly right seat

Becks expression hardens

BECK
Hes no longer on mission status

WOODY
Yeah Because you washed him out

BECK
He washed himself out He only had
to pass a few more psych evaluations
but he refused to take them

WOODY
Ray hes the best pilot I ever saw
and youve got him benched at a desk

BECK
Everybody has to pass the psych
prelims No exceptions Jim knew
that

WOODY
Maggie was his wife He didnt want
to lie on a couch and share her with
strangers

BECK
That was his call But I had to make
one too It was tough as hell but
Id do it again

WOODY
His wife wasted away in front of his
eyes What was he supposed to do
Suck it up Get with the program
What was his crime That he was upset
That he cried

BECK
I couldnt trust him

Beck and Woody stare at each other A long tense beat

BECK
(his voice softer)
Not in a crisis Im sorry Woody

but Jim lost his edge Are you gonna
stand there and tell me Jim McConnell
is the same man he was two years

ago You want me to bet four more
lives on that

This stops Woody just for a beat Then makes him press
on
harder with even greater intensity

WOODY
When Maggie died yeah it knocked
the shit out of him It knocked the
hell out of all of us But you know
and I know that hes still the best
weve got He and Maggie wrote the
book on Mars Hes got more hours in
the sims than the rest of us put
together Ray we can do this Give

will bring Luke home And thats a

Ill aim to overshoot then brake

and they also know its their only chance Woody flips

switch on the gun and pulls on the hook Off it comes

Negative on the transmission

WOODY
No I heard you Negative on the

McConnell and Terri share a quick anguished look

TERRI
Woody thats not possible Youre
not going that fast

Overhead a bellows stitched together from pieces of
tarp slowly inhales and exhales pumping air into a
the upper deck of the Hab Its power comes from a crude
wheel a buckets-and-strut assemblage tidily sutured
duct tape like some giant Erector set
As McConnell turns away from this still marvelling a
figure leaps through the foliage It smashes into him
a HARSH SCREECH knocking him to the ground
McConnell on his back straddled by his attacker
back as best he can A blur of flailing arms and fists
he tries to push the creature away Staring up he
glimpse of the almost unrecognizable
LUKE GRAHAM
Whose frightened eyes glare back at him through a
curtain of dreadlocks His skin is creased weathered
a scraggly beard His clothes are tattered patched
In one fist he grips a rock hammer which he swings
overhead about to drive the claw through McConnells
McConnell grabs his arm desperately trying to fend him

with recognition but before he can move he is seized
behind and flung backwards to the ground the hammer
from his grasp as Terri and Phil pinion his arms

scrambles to his feet

MCCONNELL
Dont hurt him

McConnell kneels beside Luke signalling to Terri and
that its okay to let him go They stand back pulling
their helmets Everyone is panting out of breath

Luke sits up slowly studying their features one after
another as if still not quite certain whether they

vanish His voice is hoarse rusty from disuse

Why Had to be for a reason Then
all of a sudden I knew why I was
spared
His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper
LUKE
So somebody would be left to figure
out the secret
He taps his forehead significantly then nods once or
twice

The others exchange an uneasy glance

MCCONNELL
Luke we still dont understand
LUKE
Come Comecomecome

He rises quickly and scuttles off waving an impatient

hand
without waiting to see if theyll follow McConnell
Terri
and Phil stare after him for a long moment Phil breaks
the
silence
PHIL
Is it just me Or is he about two
mealpacks short of a picnic
TERRI
Long term exposure to low gravity
can have an adverse impact on the
brain He could be suffering froma
form of asphyxia
MCCONNELL
Or maybe his whole crew died and
hes been marooned alone on Mars
Lets give him time to adjust
McConnell and Terri follow in the direction Luke went

EXT MARS ONE BASE CAMP DAY
Luke now in a patched-up pressure suit and grubby-
looking
helmet stands peering down unhappily at the improvised
sledge with its meager supplies McConnell Terri and
Phil
walk up behind him wearing their helmets again They
hear

Luke over his RADIO

LUKE
So let me be sure I understand
this Your ship blew up with all
its supplies Then you emptied the
cargo out of the REMO and it was
totalled on landing Youve got no
food no water no spare oxygen
nothing but what I see here

McConnell and the others are silent embarrassed Then
McConnell nods Luke looks at him a cracked grin

LUKE
What kinda rescue mission is this

MCCONNELL
That kind

He points to the computer repair case as Phil lifts it

off
a sledge Luke turns looks at the case then Phil
PHIL
Check it out New nav boards for the
ERV I got four round-trip tickets
baby right in here
LUKE

In some mysterious way this reminder of Woodys death
seems
to bring him fully back into himself He takes Terri by
the
shoulders deeply saddened She meets his gaze
LUKE
Terri Im so sorry He was a good
man
TERRI
Thanks Luke
LUKE
When theres time well talk
She nods grateful A beat He looks at the others
LUKE

He starts off across the sand and they follow
EXT GRAVE SITE DAY
They stand looking down at the three long mounds of
dirt as

Luke completes his account of the disaster

work up the nerve to go back out
there and look for their

He has to pause collect himself
LUKE
Renee was the only one I could find
But it didnt seem right somehow

to dig just one grave

There is an emotional silence Luke turns takes a few

steps
He stares into the distance observing the swirling
dust
around them McConnell hesitates notices Lukes gaze
MCCONNELL
Has it been blowing like this fora

We saw a big storm from space But
Micker said it was turning south
Luke looks off into the distance studies something
only he
seems to see

McConnell pulls his gaze away from the horizon looks
at

area of the Hab then stop in their tracks Their

are off Its very cold in here their breath is

THEIR POV --

The Lab is crammed with rock and sand samples from many
locations all tagged and labelled There are drawings

diagrams covering the walls Martian landscapes
maps and over and over obsessively repeated drawings
the vortex that destroyed the Mars One crew
LUKE

See where they made their mistake

was they mustve planned for it to

be visible from Earth

space heater at his computer As the coils glow red he

dirt rubble is the shiny-white profile of a gigantic
The white is smooth impenetrable It has the scale of

mountain but the planes and angles are clearly

MCCONNELL PHIL AND TERRI (INT MARS ONE HAB)

They are stunned Can hardly believe their eyes

PHIL

TERRI
What is that

LUKE
I dont know But whatever it is
somebody built it And not us

A few moments of silence while they try to absorb this

MCCONNELL
What about the sound That signal
you heard before the explosion
LUKE
Good Jim good Thats the key

A click of the mouse and they all HEAR over speakers
the
DEEP PULSING BASS TONE

LUKE
Hear the pauses Thats what made me
realize its a pattern -- a repeating
pattern

MCCONNELL
Mathematical

Luke is trembling with excitement His words tumble out
very
quickly Hes been waiting so long to share this

LUKE

Thats what I thought There are
distinct blocks in the pattern and
within each block the tones come in
groups of three Threethreethree
For months I struggled to analyze
it trying different constructs
Then I thought about dimensions

MCCONNELL
X-Y-Z coordinates

LUKE
Right Three groups equals three
dimensions So I tried assigning
different graphic values to each
block group and tone And finally I
got this

He types another command They all look at the monitor
the
glow reflecting on their faces They are amazed again

CLOSE ON THE MONITOR

Where we see the beautiful interlocking chain the
universally

familiar double helix of a DNA molecule -- the elegant

blueprint of life

My God Is that what I think it

is
TERRI

DNA thats a model of DNA
LUKE

You see it too Thank God I was
afraid I was just suffering froma
form of asphyxia

She glances at him surprised that he overheard her
earlier
diagnosis But he smiles not offended

PHIL
So okay so -- somebody left this
thing here somebody -- other than
human But what the hell is it

LUKE
My guess is its a signature A
self-portrait of whatever species
created the Face

MCCONNELL
But that DNA looks human

TERRI
No way Its missing the last pair
of chromosomes See

MCCONNELL
Yeah but its close Damn close

TERRI
The difference between a man and an
ape is less than three percent of
genetic material But that three
percent gives you Mozart Einstein

MCCONNELL

(hesitates)
I dont know But weve got to find
out

(to Luke pointing)
Can you work this the other way
Figure out which tones would be
equivalent to the missing chromosomes
Then dub them into your recording of
the signal

LUKE
I think so yes

MCCONNELL
What about the radar gun Will it
accept that input Can we transmit a
completed signal back to the Face

Luke stares at him startled by what hes implying

youre wrong Whoever goes out

chances

The entire sky has darkened from its customary salmon
into

the
circle of colored rings These shade from yellow on
the
outer rim to a deeper yellow then orange then

blue about a meter across Small points of light
glitter
here like stars against a midnight sky

particular Now she beckons for him to move inside the
circle
of colored rings to stand on the indigo core

MCCONNELL

at the ship around

them)
You were right Terri This is an
invitation To follow them To follow
them home

He looks into their faces Terri is trying to grasp

this
idea still incredulous Luke has the beginning of a
half
smile
MCCONNELL
I have to go This is the mission
now To find out who we are Isnt
that why we came here Like Maggie
said To stand on a new world and
look beyond it to the next one
Luke nods at the memory of Maggies words Terri
remembers
too McConnells passionate conviction is affecting
them

both

MCCONNELL
You know when you think about it --
I wasnt even supposed to be here --
all the accidents everything that
got us to this point its just
its just I just know its right

Terri looks at Luke Luke is smiling He understands

MCCONNELL
Im okay I know what Im doing But
youre running out of time Youve
gotta get back to the ERV and get
off this planet Now please go

Luke steps closer looking at his old friend

LUKE
I once felt like I was taking your
turn But now I think maybe youre
taking mine Guess Ima little
jealous

They clasp hands for a moment But in this moment is a
lifetime of camaraderie an eternity of farewell

LUKE
Thanks for saving my life

MCCONNELL
My pleasure

Luke nods deeply moved He turns away picking up his

helmet
as Terri comes closer looking at McConnell a long
unspoken
beat Her eyes are glistening
TERRI
I wish Woody were here to see this
He wouldve wanted to go too Jim
Terri smiles She is starting on the road to recovery
Shes
going to be okay
MCCONNELL
Hes here Terri We wouldnt have
made it without him
Terri nods She digs into one of her suits pockets
pulls
something out She hands it to McConnell and his fist
closes

around it

Begins to rise around him swiftly and smoothly coming
from the circumference of the indigo circle

Then a second identical cylinder -- the top half --
down from somewhere overhead The two sections meet and

LOOKING DOWN INTO THE CYLINDER we see that the cobalt-
fluid has risen to McConnells upper chest Now its at

shoulders It pours into his suit through his neck

He strains on tiptoes craning his head back trying to

He sucks in deep desperate gulps of air his head

from side to side Then suddenly the fluid is over his
