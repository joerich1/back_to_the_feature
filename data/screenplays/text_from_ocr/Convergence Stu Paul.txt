CONVERGENCE

Written by

Stuart C Paul
FADE IN
EXT NORTH ATLANTIC - NIGHT

A BLACK-BAGGED PRISONER shivers as ROBERT DAIN pilots a
ZODIAC through drifts of ice Here is a man who has spent
his life walking on the edge of a knife

A philosopher A killer His is the path of war

On his wrist Dain wears a strange device somewhere between
a hi-tech diving watch and a parasite This is the RDM

Dain hits a trigger on the RDM The FRAME BRIEFLY RUMBLES
and the device begins a TEN MINUTE COUNTDOWN

An icon appears on the display P

EXT BLACK SITE - NIGHT

The craft comes ashore on an ISLAND of jagged rocks Dain
drags his Prisoner through the surf towards a CONCRETE BUNKER

INT SALLY PORT BLACK SITE - NIGHT

A CORPORAL and two Marine GUARDS receive Dains Prisoner
Guard 1 rips the bag off the prisoners head and Guard 2
shines a light in his face revealing NAZARI CORPORAL
Mohammed Nazari you are dead Your
family has forgotten you Your
government is not looking for you
Allah does not love you
(beat )
Welcome to Nowhere

BLAM BLOOD SPRAYS as Dain puts a BULLET through the
Corporals skull The Guards barely have time to register
their shock before Dain SHOOTS THEM BOTH IN THE HEAD

Nazari smiles as Dain pulls the keys off the Corporals body
NAZARI
(in Arabic subtitled)
Who are you
DAIN
(in Arabic subtitled)

Not here for you

Dain points his gun in Nazaris face and pulls the trigger
INT CELLBLOCK BLACK SITE - NIGHT

Dain steps into a cellblock full of NON-EXTRADITION PRISONERS
Extending two PISTOLS to the sides he begins FIRING INTO
THE CELLS KILLING EVERY PRISONER AS HE MARCHES PAST

Two LUCKY INMATES cringe as Dain pulls the triggers
Click Out of ammo

Dain draws a pair of KNIVES and flings them through the bars
straight into the Lucky Inmates not-so-lucky throats

NINE MARINES come charging into the corridor UNARMED Dain
waits for the Marines to come to him

As Marine 1 swings his riot baton Dain sidesteps and with
one cobra-fast strike breaks Marine 1s nose while
simultaneously blinding him with his index and pinky fingers

Dain counters Marine 2s attack with a wrist break as he
obliterates Marine 3s knee with a low snap-kick

The remaining Marines FIRE Dain ROLLS scooping up two of
the fallen Marines batons as gunfire chews up the floor

Back up on his feet Dain wields the batons like a pair of
samurai short swords engulfing Marines 4 and 5 in a tornado
of broken ribs shattered knuckles and burst kidneys

Dain swings one baton up into Marine 6s tricep while
bringing the other down on his forearm SNAPPING his arm

Marine 6s gun drops and Dain KICKS it into Marine 7s
face The gun MASHES 7s nose in and goes off blowing a
hole through Marine 8s cheek

Dain drives one baton through the gunshot hole in 8s cheek
and pounds his fist down on the other end snapping his jaw
and levering the baton into his brain

One final spin and Dain plunges the other baton into Marine
9s eye socket Marine 9s body slides to the floor
INT SOLITARY CELL - MOMENTS LATER

A malnourished Caucasian SOLITARY INMATE looks up as the
door UNLOCKS revealing Dain looming like an angel of death

DAIN
Ready to check out

REINFORCEMENTS flood down the hall and open fire

Dain SLAMS the door shut Bullets RICOCHET off the cell
door as Dains RDM counts down 0502 0501 0500

The RDM emits FIVE SHORT BEEPS The FRAME begins to RUMBLE
Dain grabs the Solitary Inmate their bodies VIBRATING

DAIN (CONTD)
Abra

Dain and the Solitary Inmate both VANISH
CUT TO

EXT ZODIAC - NORTH ATLANTIC - NIGHT
THE RUMBLING FRAME carries over to the empty ocean Suddenly
Dain and the Solitary Inmate APPEAR OUT OF THIN AIR as the
Zodiac raft MATERIALIZES into the middle of the sea

DAIN (CONTD)

Cadabra

INT CELLBLOCK BLACK SITE - NIGHT

The Marines whip open the door The cell is EMPTY save
for a lone GRENADE wobbling back and forth As it EXPLODES--

CUT TO
EXT BEACH - DAY
Waves CRASH as a STORM churns the sea into a fervor

SUPER CIA TRAINING CAMP - CAMP PEARY VA

INT TENT — DAY

Oblivious to the gale-force winds strafing the sides of the
tent HENRY SHAW moves a white pawn on a chess board
In the real world hes just a guy Here hes God

His OPPONENT considers his move as an audience of AGENTS IN
TRAINING gather A chalkboard has the names of each candidate
matched to a particular chess piece

HENRY
Control it Dont play the man
play the board But not this board

Henry and his OPPONENT go back and forth vying for position
HENRY (CONTD)
Youre playing what the boards gonna
look like five moves from now You
have to see the future Not just
one future every future Then one
by one you take them away And
thats when strategy becomes battle

The Opponent moves his Queen to take Henrys knight Only
this isnt normal chess Both pieces remain on the square

HENRY (CONTD)
White Knight and Black Queen

Two Trainees WHITE KNIGHT and BLACK QUEEN step up

WHITE KNIGHT BLACK QUEEN
Sir yes sir Sir yes sir

EXT BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

The Trainees gather in a circle around White Knight and Black
Queen as they face off on the storming beach

HENRY
Gentlemen play chess

White Knight and Black Queen go at it like rabid dogs

HENRY (CONTD)
There is no situation you cannot
control To control your opponent
you have to control his mind Control
his mind and you control his world

White Knight tackles his opponent to the mud They wrestle
for control as White Knight puts Black Queen in a HEADLOCK

HENRY (CONTD)
Dont like the forecast Change the
weather If your opponent likes
sunshine make it snow If he likes
to ice skate take him for a swim

Just as it looks like hes down for the count Black Queen
rolls into the CRASHING SURF -- slips free -- and PINS White
Knight facedown in the tide White Knight TAPS OUT

INT TENT - MOMENTS LATER

Back to the chess board The Black Queen takes the contested
square Henrys knight is taken off the board
BLACK TEAM MEMBER
Hes got you on the run now Chief

HENRY
A good strategist makes his opponent
move where he wants him to move
And a great strategist makes him
think it was his idea Did you take
my knight Or knowing there was no
way LaVoie was gonna beat Russo did
I sacrifice my knight to draw out
your queen

Henry castles his king and rook switching their positions
and bringing his rook in line with the Opponents king

HENRY (CONTD)
Checkmate

INT LOCKER ROOM CAMP PEARY - DAY

Henry opens his locker revealing a PHOTO of him his wife
and ten-year-old son on a camping trip He gets changed
when two other instructors TRAEGER and MCCALL come in

TRAEGER
Nothing like a run in forty mile-per-
hour winds to remind these hot shots
theyre not as slick as they think

MCCALL
Henry tell him what we used to call
tropical storms back in the SEALs

HENRY
Hurricanes for pussies

Traeger and McCall bust up laughing Henry grabs his
cellphone and freezes He has 7 MISSED CALLS
INT COMA UNIT HOSPITAL - DAY

Soaked Henry marches past the staff and walks straight into
one of the rooms only to find the bed empty

VALERIE stares out the window A woman of warmth shes
lost from months of living in a constant limbo

VALERIE
They just moved him to the ICU
INT ICU HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

A NURSE pulls back a curtain revealing Henrys son MICHAEL lying comatose The boy must weigh 70 pounds A net

of electrodes cover three months of hair growth An IV feeds
his veins Henry places his hand on his sons chest feeling
it rise and fall to the rhythm of an ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATOR

EXT WASHINGTON DC -— DAY

Runoff pours down the streets as if the storm were attempting
to wash away the citys patina of bullshit

INT MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Dain sits at a desk covered in electronics and tools An
envelope has been torn open revealing THREE PASSPORTS and
an assortment of INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY on the bed

The TV is on in the bg the news showing footage of bridges
washed out homes destroyed people being rescued from floods

WEATHER REPORTER (VO)
Tropical Storm Aria continues its
march of destruction across the
eastern United States leading many
to question why experts failed to
predict the storms emergence In
Financial News another rollercoaster
week in the stock market

The RDM sits on the desk giving us a glimpse of raw
irritated skin on Dains arm where it was attached He
solders a wire into place when his hand begins to SHAKE

His VISION DOUBLES and the MUSIC WARPS

Tensing his fist Dain controls his breathing as he focuses
willing away the double vision as we reveal what he has been
building -- A SUITCASE BOMB

INT DR ZADEHS OFFICE HOSPITAL - DAY

Henry paces while Valerie sits and waits Nervous energy
fills the room

VALERIE
Did you notice his hair It changed
color Its--

HENRY

Paler
They look
DR ZADEH

up expectantly as the door opens as the neurologist enters

DR ZADEH
Im sorry for the wait I wanted to
get Michaels latest CT scan before
we spoke Please take a seat

Henry forces himself to sit

Henry and

DR ZADEH (CONTD)
This is the situation Earlier this
morning your son suffered a seizure
His lungs stopped functioning

Valerie listen too horrified to speak

DR ZADEH (CONTD)
Our nursing staff reacted quickly
and restored his breathing via
respirator Hes been stabilized

VALERIE
So hes-- hes okay

DR ZADEH
Understand we have very little
control over what happens in the
mind of a coma patient We hoped
that by reducing the swelling in his
brain it would give the coma room
to allow Michaels body to repair
itself Unfortunately his EEGs
have shown a steady decline in brain
activity over the past three months
Since this incident that decline
has increased At this rate he
will meet all the criteria of brain
death within the week

Henry balks at the doctors academic wording

HENRY
Meet all the criteria

DR ZADEH
Im sorry but its time for you to
consider Michaels quality of life

HENRY
Youre sorry When I left last night
he was fine What did you do

Valerie puts a hand on his shoulder restraining him
VALERIE
Please There must be some other
option Well do anything

Dr Zadeh leans back reluctant to give them false hope

DR ZADEH
There is a surgical alternative that
has had some success restoring brain
activity in coma patients but its
still in the experimental stages A
series of wires are implanted directly
into the brain tissue The patient
is taken off life support and an
electrical shock applied to the
neurons The idea is to force his
brain to take back control

HENRY
Whats the success rate

Dr Zadeh hesitates unable to meet their eyes

DR ZADEH
About ten percent

Henry and Valerie reel at the staggeringly low figure
DR ZADEH (CONTD)
If you do want to pursue the surgery
you need to let me know as soon as

possible In a week the treatment
will no longer be an option

INT HENRY AND VALERIES CAR - FOREST HIGHWAY - DUSK
Bullets of rain strafe the windshield as Henry drives and
Valerie numbly stares out the window each of them lost in
their own private Hell Suddenly Henry pulls off the road
EXT FOREST - DUSK

Henry gets out of the car and marches into the woods
searching for something Confused Valerie follows

VALERIE
Henry Where are you going

She finds him stopped in the middle of a clearing

HENRY
You remember this place
VALERIE
We camped right over there You and
Michael must have spent an hour trying
to start the fire by rubbing two
sticks together You absolutely
refused to use matches

HENRY
We got it eventually

Henry circles a nearby tree There is a slight ring of scar
tissue on one of the branches

HENRY (CONTD)
This is the tree he was climbing
when he broke his arm You can barely
see where the branch snapped Its
like it never happened

Giving in to a sudden bout of fury Henry pulls out a
pocketknife and begins hacking at the trees limb -- harder
faster -- until he spills to the ground and breaks down

Valerie kneels beside him and they hold each other helpless
to stop the life theyve built together from slipping away

EXT CIA ANNEX WASHINGTON DC - NIGHT

INT INTERROGATION ROOM CIA ANNEX - NIGHT

The two Operatives stand watch as Dain sits his legs
plasticuffed to his metal chair Agent Cassidy enters

AGENT CASSIDY
Welcome home Mister Dain

DAIN
Your hospitality isnt what I recall

AGENT CASSIDY
There was a security breach at our
Black Site in the North Sea The
odd part is we detected a divergence
from your RDM unit at the same time
the facility came under attack

DAIN
Theres nothing odd about it The
compound came under attack I used
the RDM to escape

AGENT CASSIDY
Why didnt you report in We thought
you were killed with the others

DAIN
That was the idea

Agent Cassidy looks up to meet Dains stone cold gaze

metal back SNAPPING his legs out of the plasticuffs as
Operative 1 goes sprawling THROUGH THE ONE-WAY MIRROR

His arms still attached to the chair behind his back Dain
springs to his feet Operative 2 opens fire but Dain spins
using the metal chairback to deflect the gunfire

Dain lunges off the wall slides and backwards across the
table on his knees The chair slams into Operative 2 and
falls to the seated position pinning him to the ground

Dain reaches down SNAPS Operative 2s neck swipes his
Operatives gun and FIRES a bullet through his plasticuffs

Agent Cassidy scrambles out the shattered window and scoops
the gun out of Operative 1s holster when Dain FIRES
Operative 2s gun putting a bullet BETWEEN CASSIDYS EYES
INT TECH ROOM CIA ANNEX

Dain marches in and cracks the RDM Tech over the head with

A quiet home in the suburbs The house is dark save for a
light accompanying the SOUND OF TOOLS coming from the garage
INT GARAGE HENRYS HOUSE - NIGHT
The floor is strewn with sawdust paint and dried resin from

hundreds of projects over the years Henry uses a sanding
belt to smooth down the surface of a wooden CHESS PIECE

INT GARAGE HENRYS HOUSE - DAY (FLASHBACK)
Michael--awake healthy full of joy--rests his chin on the

edge of the workbench watching as Henry hand carves one of
the pieces

Henry pulls his son onto his lap hands Michael the knife
and puts his hand over his sons small fingers carefully
guiding him as they carve the piece together

BACK TO PRESENT

Henry blows the dust off the chess piece and places it with
the rest of the CHESS SET lined up on a shelf

However this isnt normal chess set Each piece is designed
to look like a different baseball player The white pieces
are the Orioles the Yankees the black pieces

VALERIE (0S)

Henry sees Valerie standing in the doorway He turns off
the sanding belt She holds up the phone Henry frowns
glancing at the clock Its 4 AM He takes the phone

INT SECURITY CHECK CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Looking uncomfortable in a collared shirt Henry hands his
ID to AGENCY SECURITY The Officer scans his badge sees a
note on the computer AGENT REEVES Ivy League silver
spooner without the attitude approaches

AGENT REEVES

HENRY
We have the same first name Imagine
that

AGENT REEVES
Hope you didnt get lost

HENRY
Its been a while since I was last
here but I remembered where to park

INT CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Henry and Agent Reeves pass through Analysts swarm around
monitors showing the bombed-out CIA Annex

AGENT REEVES

Earlier this morning a bomb went

off at one of our monitoring stations
(MORE )
AGENT REEVES (CONTD)
Were telling the media it was a
faulty gas main but the Directors
circling the wagons

HENRY
Im just a ranch hand at the Farm
I dont see what help I can be

AGENT REEVES
The Deputy Director will tell you
all about it

INT FAULKNERS OFFICE CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

FAULKNER a pit bull in a starched shirt and a tie
paces while talking on the phone

FAULKNER
No sir Nothing indicates this is
the start of anything larger Just
some jihadist trying to get his bowl
of cherries Ill keep you posted

Faulkner hangs up as Agent Reeves and Henry enter

FAULKNER (CONTD)
Is this the guy

AGENT REEVES
This is the guy

FAULKNER
(to Henry)
Are you the guy

HENRY
Everyone else seems to think so

FAULKNER

Deputy Director Jack Faulkner We
have a situation Reeves believes
youre the man for the job Im
skeptical See I was always told
those who can do Those who did
but lost their balls teach

(beat )
Your file says youre the Agent
Training Programs Chief of Strategic
Thinking What is that You teach
the rookies to read Sun Tzu while
theyre yanking on each others dicks

HENRY
No sir Just their own dicks

Faulkner hides a flicker of a grin He likes this guy

HENRY (CONTD)
Strategic Thinking is just what it
sounds like An Agents most powerful
weapon isnt his pistol Its this

Henry taps the side of his skull

FAULKNER
Interesting Five years ago another
man sat in that same chair and gave
me the exact same answer

Henry looks up uttering one word his reverence manifest

HENRY
Dain

FAULKNER
Dain Tell me about him

HENRY
Everything I know thats worth a
damn I learned from him

FAULKNER
What kind of man is he

HENRY
Cicero Attila the Hun George S
Patton Robert Dain

FAULKNER
When was the last time you saw him

HENRY
Not since I left his SEAL team so
ten years

FAULKNER
Whyd you leave

HENRY
My girlfriend got pregnant

FAULKNER
Howd he take it

HENRY
Dain doesnt like other people making
decisions he hasnt made for them

FAULKNER
And hows he mentally

HENRY
Those men I mentioned a minute ago
arent famous for flunking the SAT

FAULKNER
Let me rephrase Is he sane

HENRY
(beat )
What exactly is this about

FAULKNER
Dains the Big Bad Wolf He huffed
and he puffed and he blew up my
goddamn house

INT HALLWAY CIA HEADQUARTERS —- DAY
Henry Faulkner and Agent Reeves head down the hall

HENRY
You cant seriously believe Robert
Dain set off a bomb on American soil

FAULKNER
A lots changed After you left
active duty I recruited Dain into
the CIAs Obsidian Operations His
assignments involved the kidnapping
and elimination of targets through
the creation of divergent realities

Henry stops walking

HENRY
Did you say realities

INT BRIEFING ROOM CIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY
Henry and Faulkner sit as Reeves controls a wall screen

AGENT REEVES
Dains last assignment was Mohammed
Nazari a Sunni terrorist responsible
for at least eighteen bombings
While delivering Nazari to our black
site for interrogation Dain
eliminated all inmates and personnel

Agent Reeves pulls up photos of the black sites slaughter

FAULKNER
I believe apeshit is the scientific
term The next day he walked into
the programs command center

AGENT REEVES
This is reconstructed footage from
his debriefing

Damaged security footage shows Agent Cassidy questioning
Dain when the bomb EXPLODES

AGENT REEVES (CONTD)
Five minutes later one of our
secondary cameras caught this image

Footage switches to an EXTERIOR SHOT of the bombed-out
building when it zooms in on a LONE FIGURE emerging from the
rubble Reeves freezes the image and zooms in on Dain

HENRY
Thats impossible Nobody could
have survived that explosion

FAULKNER
He didnt

Agent Reeves pulls up a photo of Dains charred corpse

FAULKNER (CONTD)
Dains flash-fried corpse is still
at the bomb site along with every
other member of program operations

Henry leans forward trying to make sense of it He squints
noticing the RDM on Dains arm in the video still

HENRY
Whats that on his arm

FAULKNER
The ghost in the machine

Agent Reeves pulls up a SCHEMATIC of the RDM

AGENT REEVES
We call it the Reality Divergence
Mechanism It was developed by Doctor
Kacem Rennaud a French physicist
and former member of CERN Rennaud
was exploring an old idea of
Einsteins called Unified Field
Theory It was his attempt to unite
gravity and the electromagnetic force

FAULKNER
Only it never worked Old Crazy Hair
retracted the theory before his death

AGENT REEVES
When CERN found out Rennaud was using
grant money to investigate what
physicists roundly declared Einsteins
greatest blunder they cut his
funding Rennaud was blacklisted

FAULKNER
The man couldnt get a job teaching
high school physics to goats In an
uncharacteristic display of foresight
the CIA took over funding Rennauds
research in exchange for rights to
any technology that came from it

Agent Reeves plays a video A title card pops up RDM PROJECT -
TUTORIAL 1 RENNAUD a Frenchman who can talk particle
physics as easily as fine wines appears on-screen

RENNAUD

Welcome This series will introduce
you to the laws possibilities and
limitations of the Reality Divergence
Mechanism The universe is built on
probabilities For every event
there is an infinity of possible
outcomes Yet only one can become
real The outcome of the highest
probability is the one we experience
We call this the Prime Reality All
other possible worlds exist only as
an array of mathematical what-ifs

(beat )
The RDM changes that It allows for
the creation of a second parallel or
Divergent Reality

Rennaud steps over to a clear plastic box containing a vial
of chemical and a hammer connected to a Geiger counter

RENNAUD (CONTD)
Now the infamous thought experiment
of Schroedingers Cat remains mere
thought no longer Here we have a
vial of euthanasia gas a hammer and

a Geiger counter Into this box I
will place two items--a piece of
uranium and a cat

CAMERA PANS to reveal a lump of uranium and cat carrier
Rennaud attaches the RDM to the cats collar HENRY looks
to Agent Reeves with an unspoken What the fuck

RENNAUD (CONTD)
Let me assure my viewers that our
intrepid test subject suffers from
feline leukemia and was scheduled
to be put down within the week We
have used special irradiation
techniques to ensure a fifty percent
chance the uranium will decay in the
next thirty seconds If this happens
the Geiger counter will swing the
hammer releasing the poison Thus
the riddle when I open the box
will the cat be alive or dead

Rennaud places the cat and uranium both inside the box

RENNAUD (CONTD)
I am now initiating divergence

Rennaud triggers a DIVERGENCE FRAME RUMBLES and subsides
The RDM reads P and begins a TEN MINUTE COUNTDOWN

RENNAUD (CONTD)
You have just witnessed reality split

The hammer SHATTERS the vial releasing the gas The cat
lies down and is PUT TO SLEEP

RENNAUD (CONTD)
As you can see here in the Prime
Reality the uranium decay has
triggered the poisons release
However we can rest assured that in
the divergent reality our furry
friend remains quite healthy But
perhaps you dont believe me

The RDM BEEPS The FRAME RUMBLES as a duplicate LIVE CAT
appears inside the box with the dead cat The live cat reacts
pretty much like youd expect ie it freaks the fuck out

RENNAUD (CONTD)
Thus the riddles answer--the cat is
neither alive nor dead but both

Rennaud opens the box The cat shrieks claws him and runs
away TOPPLING THE CAMERA OFF THE SOUNDS of scrambling
the video JUMP CUTS Rennaud now has a bandage on his hand

RENNAUD (CONTD)
Cheating death Just one example of
the impossible made possible thanks
to the Reality Divergence Mechanism
Until next time I am Doctor Kacem
Rennaud bidding you adieu

The video holds for an awkward beat and then ends Henry
tries to wrap his mind around what he just saw

HENRY
I hope you dont let anyone from
PETA see that

FAULKNER
Robert Dain has stolen fire from the
gods I want you to get it back

HENRY
I havent been in the field in ten
years There must be other operatives
in the program whod be better suited--

AGENT REEVES
We tried our other operatives Dain
got to them first

Reeves pulls up photos of THREE OPERATIVES all ASSASSINATED

FAULKNER
We need you Shaw Dain trained
you The two of you ran over two
hundred successful covert ops Youre
the only one who knows how he thinks

HENRY
Sir my son is dying I cant get
involved in something like this

FAULKNER
I dont think you fully appreciate
the potential of this device Ina
Divergent Reality you can conduct
recon expose the enemys position
or turn the odds of a dangerous and
experimental surgery in your favor

Henry looks up disbelief mingling with hope

HENRY
What are you saying

FAULKNER
Your son is going to die If you
dont like that reality pick another

Henry looks at the RDM schematic and all the possibilities
it holds

INT KITCHEN HENRYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Henry comes in The house has the silent feel of a crypt
Dirty dishes are piled in the sink The kitchen table is
strewn with bank statements insurance forms and a calculator

Henry picks up a notepad covered in financial figures He
flips through the pages tosses the notepad aside and pauses
as he notices a pamphlet poking out from under some papers

He picks it up Its a MORTUARY PAMPHLET

INT MASTER BEDROOM HENRYS HOUSE - NIGHT

Henry finds Valerie curled up on the bed He sits down and
begins to rub her feet

VALERIE
I talked to the insurance company
Theyre refusing to cover the surgery
I ran the numbers If we empty the
savings take out a second mortgage
we should be able to make it Ill
need you to go with me to the bank
tomorrow to sign the papers

Henry stops rubbing her feet She senses his hesitation

HENRY
I have to go away for a few days

Valerie pulls her feet away as she sits up

VALERIE
You cant be serious Go where

HENRY
Its classified

VALERIE
Jesus Youre going back into the
field

Valerie stands to leave the bedroom but Henry grabs her

HENRY
Val wait You dont understand

VALERIE
Dont understand what Being scared
Being angry I know what youre
feeling but running isnt the answer

HENRY
Im not running Val I saw something
today Im not even sure what it
was but if even half of it is true
we can save him

VALERIE
What are you talking about
HENRY
Im so sick of being useless Sitting

by his bed not even sure if he can
hear my voice My son this piece
of me--of us--is dying and Ill do
anything--anything to save him I
swear to you I can bring him back
All I have to do is this one thing

Valerie stares at Henry seeing the belief in his face
VALERIE
Then do it but do it fast Because
in a week itll be too late

INT MICHAELS ROOM ICU - NIGHT

Henry arranges the chess set beside his sons bed but the
LAST PIECE is only partially carved

HENRY
Hey Mike I have to go away for a
while Ill be back as soon as I
can I brought you something

(beat )
Well finish it when I get back

EXT BOMBED-OUT CIA ANNEX - DAY

A government sedan pulls up to the bombing site which is
surrounded by FBI Agents police and news crews Henry
Faulkner and Agent Reeves climb out and head inside

HENRY
Dains first move will have been to
get out of the country

AGENT REEVES
We have Dains description out to
border patrol toll booths and TSA
at every airport on the East Coast

FAULKNER
Which is about as effective as putting
up flyers for a lost dog after
Lassies been run over by a minivan

INT BOMBED-OUT CIA ANNEX - DAY

Henry Faulkner and Agent Reeves wade through the facilitys
ruins Wires and fried circuitboards dangle like vines

HENRY
Maybe theres another way Can we
detect when Dain uses the RDM

FAULKNER
Youre standing in it When Dain
destroyed our command center he

Its a way to have your cake and
waterboard it too

HENRY
Is there anything in Dains behavior
recently that might suggest motive

FAULKNER
His motives the same as every other
agent whos gone rogue since time
began money

HENRY
The Dain I knew didnt care about
money

FAULKNER
The Dain you knew didnt blow up
American citizens either Time
changes people Add the mental strain
of repeated exposure to diverging
realities and you have a recipe
for what did they call it

Thatd be a nice Fuck you Billy
for the National Spelling Bee

AGENT REEVES
During subject trials repeated use
of the RDM was found to lead to
insomnia depression and psychosis

Welcome to my corner of the universe
Here at Prescient Labs we conduct

from Claytronics and Spaceflight
Propulsion to Quantum Computing
Were even preparing to launch a

EHLY
As you can see using his countrys
resources to sell technology to
foreigners has been very lucrative

RENNAUD
I am French I am not using my
countrys resources--Im using yours
Besides a Swiss working for the CIA
is in no position to throw stones

HENRY
You need to send these people home

RENNAUD
But we have projects to deliver

standing in a static-free test chamber a la THX-1138

RENNAUD
Arthur C Clarke once said that any
sufficiently advanced technology is
indistinguishable from magic To
catch Dain you must become a magician

HENRY
How does it work

RENNAUD

The RDM manipulates perpendicular
electromagnetic fields emanating
from the Divergent Field Generators
probability engine which causes
collisions between photons and
gravitons creating a cascade of
supersymmetric antiparticles which
carry a holographic image of our
universe through the Planck length

hand on a tactile pad with a compartment for each finger

HENRY
Do I need to worry about uh megalo

HENRY
Yeah that
RENNAUD

No no The mental and physical
symptoms of RDM psychosis only
manifest after repeated exposure

Rennaud hits a switch Five needles suddenly jab out of the
tactile pad into Henrys fingertips He snaps his hand back

RENNAUD (CONTD)
Just a small graviton injection to
integrate the RDM into your biology
It allows you to bring anything youre
directly touching from one reality

tracery of nerves going from the RDM to Henrys fingertips

Rennaud and Henry continue up towards the roof

RENNAUD
As long as the countdown is going
you can still trigger convergence

Not really The Law of Quantum Symmetry
states that the coexistence of two
atomically identical objects in one
reality is impossible The very idea
gives the universe a headache

correct but at the moment of death
the quantum symmetry was broken
making them two different objects

The true mark of a master is his skill
at transporting objects from Point A
in one reality to Point B in the other
via Geographic Transposition

Rennaud hands Henry his coffee while he picks up a rubber
band off the reception desk and pulls the two ends apart

RENNAUD (CONTD)

Creating a divergence is like

stretching a rubber band One end

is the Prime Reality the other the

Divergent When you trigger a

convergence the RDM that initiates

it becomes the anchor The other

device including anything it is

touching will be pulled to the Point

I was giving those men back what I
stole The one thing all men have a
right to The gift of death

HENRY
You call that honorable

DAIN
I call it necessary Im walking down
a road and its name is war Mark me

HENRY
Why are you doing this

DAIN
If you could un-invent the atomic
bomb by killing one person would
you do it What about ten people
A hundred A thousand

ANGLE ON INTERSTICE
Ehly steps in from the next train car and pauses

DAIN (0S) (CONTD)
Supposedly morality has no threshold
Actually its simple math You take
the number of people killed by nuclear
weapons since their creation

ANGLE ON LAVATORY

DAIN (CONTD)

You add to that the number of people
you estimate will be killed by them
in the future Then you subtract
one Thats the threshold Anything
above is unjust Anything below and
killing not only becomes acceptable
collateral damage it becomes a moral
imperative But it all comes down
to that one person And Im sorry
tell you this but its not you

About twenty minutes ago

The nurses push Michaels bed out of his room taking him
down the hall Dr Zadeh moves to intercept Valerie

What will happen to the bodies

HENRY
The Agency will make up some story

RENNAUD
Have you read Frankenstein

It takes Henry a moment to register the change of subject

HENRY
No I watched the old black and
white movie with my son one Halloween

RENNAUD
I always found the convention of the
mad scientist absurd This comical
object of derision driven past the
limits of his own sanity by his lust
for knowledge I never believed it
existed Until today

HENRY
I need you to build me another RDM

RENNAUD
And how do you propose I do that
Dain destroyed the hard drives
They contained over a decade of
experimental data proofs schematics

HENRY
You already built two of them How
difficult can it be to build a third

RENNAUD
Consider the Great Pyramid When
the pyramid falls you cant simply
go back to the top because you built
it once before All Ive spent a
lifetime building is gone

I was lying on the floor dead

Rennaud sits nearby using the hospitals medical supplies
to bandage his leg

RENNAUD
Its called a convergent cerebral
hemorrhage Its not unlike

Rennaud hisses breaking into a flurry of French curses as
he disinfects the wound

So you jumped after him

And it saved my life Dain and I
were touching when he converged

Henry Ehly and Rennaud talk with Faulkner on the sat-phone

HENRY
Dain got the drop on us but now we
have the advantage

FAULKNER
Is it Opposite Day and nobody told
me
HENRY
Years ago when I was on his SEAL
Team Dain led a mission into North
Korea Our objective was to wipe
out their chemical weapons program
Dains plan had Four Phases Phase
One was to blind them by taking out
their surveillance Second was human
intel Chemists designers engineers--
anyone who knew how the technology
worked who could rebuild it in the
future Third was data--every scrap
of knowledge related to the project

FAULKNER
And Phase Four

HENRY
The death blow We set off a bomb
to destroy their launch facility
(beat )
A Total Wipe

FAULKNER
Are you telling me Dains waging a
war on the RDM program

HENRY
No Wars have survivors What Dains
doing is more on par with
technological genocide

EHLY
We think Dain robbed the bank to
fund his attack on his final target

Faulkner and Agent Reeves exchange a glance

FAULKNER
The Divergent Field Generator

AGENT REEVES
Its the only possible target left

HENRY
What is it

Faulkner gives Rennaud his tacit approval to go ahead

RENNAUD
The individual RDM units are simply
tools that cause localized
manipulations of the earths
probability field It is the
generator however that makes those
manipulations possible

AGENT REEVES
The generators buried a mile under
the Alps on the Swiss-German Border

EHLY
If Dain destroys it what kind of
fallout are we looking at

RENNAUD

The generator runs at approximately
one hundred twenty Teraelectron volts

(to Henry)
A two followed by thirteen zeroes
Of course it would depend on the
payload but I would say a
conservative estimate would be
the destruction of all southwest
Germany and parts of Switzerland

EHLY
You think Dain would go that far

HENRY

Dain believes in what hes doing
And when youve seen entire worlds
created and destroyed at the press
of a button the death of one two
or two million is nothing

something

GERHARDT --a dignified German with an air of culture and
menace--spritzes a bottle of perfume on a rag and sniffs it

GERHARDT
A touch more rosemary I should think
Something to give the sensation of
the wind carrying the scent of fresh
baked goose from the frauleins
cottage just down the road

The Bodyguards draw numbers on the Bald Mens heads each
number matching one of the racehorses

A BELL RINGS and theyre off

The Bald Men watch the horses sprint around the track vying
for the lead The horses come down the home stretch

And its 13 by a nose

They step into her kitchen which boasts a variety of coffee
beans in sealed canisters and an espresso machine that looks
like it will soon give birth to Skynet

INT EHLYS APARTMENT - LATER

Henry looks through the apartment while Ehly makes coffee
The walls are covered in black and white photographs of empty
street scenes Theres something haunting about them

HENRY
Say you just stole a few million
dollars from a Swiss bank

EHLY
Did you see the size of that bag
Id put it closer to fifty million
Sixty if he opted for Euros

HENRY
I dont care if Dain stole a hundred
million pesos I want to know where

he shops

Ehly enters with a couple lattes
EHLY
Depends what kind of bomb he wants

HENRY
Considering the size of his target
hes going to need military-grade
ordinance You

Henry takes a sip of coffee then looks up in surprise

HENRY (CONTD)
Damn that is good
(beat )
You still have friends in Interpol

EHLY
One or two

HENRY
Think you can have them send over a
list of arms dealers in western Europe
with access to high-yield explosives

EHLY
Why not just ask the CIA

HENRY
If you want to find a good Chinese
restaurant you ask a Chinese person--
not the American tourist on the corner

EHLY
Ill make some calls

HENRY
And I1l go back to the safe house
check Dains mission summaries again
See if theres anything I missed

His hand trembling slightly Henry sets his coffee down
winces at a headache pinches the bridge of his nose

EHLY
Perhaps you should get some sleep

HENRY
Im so jetlagged my body doesnt
know what planet its on Whats
your excuse

EHLY
Try sleeping after youve just seen
yourself lying in the morgue

Good point Henry notices a chessboard on a book shelf
HENRY
You play
EHLY
It was my fathers He was intent

that I should become a world-class
musician or a world-class chess
player He failed on both counts

HENRY
Ive been teaching my son to play
Hed rather be watching baseball

Henry pulls out his half-carved chess piece He draws
pocketknife and continues carving it

HENRY (CONTD)

Weve been carving this set together
His favorite team is the Orioles

Our nemesis is the Yankees ever since
the season they beat us fifteen games
to three So whites Baltimore
blacks New York I figured it would
be a fun way to teach him chess

EHLY
Did it work

HENRY
We never finished Three months
ago he collapsed and went into a
coma The doctors said he contracted
some rare form of viral encephalitis
He may as well have been struck by
lightning

EHLY
And you think the RDM can save him

HENRY
After what Ive seen I know it can

EHLY
You should know there are some things
even the RDM cant change

HENRY
What Like Fate

EHLY
Fate is nothing but humanitys attempt
to ascribe motive to the randomness
which determines our lives

HENRY
I determine my own life

EHLY
When I was on that bridge with Dain
I knew that if I did not jump after
him the entire reality myself
included would cease to be I chose
to jump because I had no other choice

HENRY
So we have no control over our lives

EHLY
Oh we have control in a superfluous
way We can choose our college major
left or right paper or plastic
But the truth is in life as in chess
the game is largely decided not by
the end but by the opening moves

INT GERHARDTS PENTHOUSE CASINO - NIGHT

collection His hand begins to shake but the RDM is
concealed by his jacket Gerhardt enters from the next room

GERHARDT

Thirty million to me the remaining
funds to the Russians on delivery

DAIN
I see youre still making Europe
smell pretty

GERHARDT
Perfumery is an unappreciated art
Few realize it offers medicinal as
well as cosmetic benefits

Gerhardt pulls down one of the bottles Dain sniffs it

DAIN
Absinthe

GERHARDT
I call it Luau Number Five It also
contains cannabinoid extract and
kava from the Hawaiian Isles I
thought it might help with the pain

DAIN
Pain

Gerhardt spritzes some of the perfume onto a handkerchief

GERHARDT
Come now Robert I know a man with
a monkey on his back when I see one

He offers Dain the handkerchief Dain hesitates

GERHARDT (CONTD)
After all these years you still
dont trust me Very wise

Gerhardt inhales deeply then offers Dain the handkerchief
Dain follows suit As the absinthe hits his brain cells
Dain stares off allowing himself a moment of unguarded truth

DAIN
Hey Gerhardt you believe in Hell

GERHARDT
Of course not but I fear it You

DAIN
A few years back I was sent to a
village in Bangladesh Things got
messy The military had to bomb the
village Women kids

GERHARDT
They do get in the way dont they

DAIN
As I was leaving the wind blew over
this tattered pamphlet the local
missionaries were handing out On
the back it had a place to write
what you want to be when you grow
up Some kid had written in farmer
He didnt say astronaut or President
or basketball player This child
had no illusions He knew his Fate
I didnt just take his life I stole
his destiny

you to fulfill yours

HENRY
I was thinking about what you said
last night about the end of a chess
match being determined by the opening
Weve been looking at the board as
it stands now when we should be
looking at Dains first moves

EHLY
His attack on the prison

HENRY
Every single prisoner was accounted
for except one

Henry pulls up one of Dains mission profiles on his phone
Target PHILIP ISHERWOOD Objective KK Its the same
man Dain rescued from the Black Site Prison in the opening

HENRY (CONTD)
Philip Isherwood He was a
mathematician specializing in pattern
analysis Faulkner had him targeted
for a K-and-K The next day
Isherwood was found dead in his home

EHLY
Let me guess Cerebral hemorrhage
HENRY
Dain delivered Isherwoods double to
a CIA prison Two weeks later he
went back and rescued him

EHLY
Something must have changed his mind

HENRY
Heres the catch Within twenty-
four hours Dain went from breaking
Isherwood out of prison to setting
off the bomb in Washington

EHLY
He had to have help--someone to take
Isherwood off his hands

HENRY
Someone like Werner Gerhardt

Henry holds up Gerhardts Interpol dossier

for this kind of thing

Rennaud inserts the RDM into the HOLLOWED-OUT HEEL of a shoe

HENRY
Whats with the shoe
RENNAUD
It would not take long for security
to notice you playing with your watch
every time we win so Ive outfitted
this shoe with a trigger under the
big toe to control the RDM

HENRY
What about the actual cheating

RENNAUD
The odds of the ball landing in any
one slot are one-in-thirty-three
However if you know the position of
the wheel and ball the odds are
closer to one-in-eight Better
Not great Thats where the Divergent
Field Generator comes in manipulating
the wheels probability wave function

HENRY
In human speak

RENNAUD
The Prime Reality is set but we can
pick which of the possible divergent
outcomes we want to come true

HENRY
When we converge wont the other
players see the ball change places

RENNAUD
Not if we time it right As long as
you converge while the object is
still in motion persistence of vision
will ensure the other players see
only what we want them to

But Dain broke him out of prison and
had Gerhardt send him into hiding

Isherwood noticed abnormalities in
certain areas of pattern distribution
He believed something was interfering
with the basic laws of physics

created it makes an incremental
alteration in the natural selection
of reality Over time those changes
build introducing unlikely and
chaotic phenomena into the world

of the RDMs impact on the world
Dain was sent to silence me When
he heard what I had to say it
affected him most profoundly

This is what turned Dain against the

ISHERWOOD
How does a man who spent his life in
moral anathema rediscover his
conscience Not by emotion or
sentiment but by proof Dain believed
he was damning his soul for the good
of mankind but he was deceived
The RDM is a cancer to the very Laws
of Existence We have discovered
how to make God bleed

HENRY
And this is his solution Killing
millions of people

Logically his plan is sound Morally
it leaves something to be desired

Why dont you stop him There is
enough evidence here to shut down
the RDM Program for good

ISHERWOOD
No Only for a time Man forgets
but knowledge never dies Total
destruction is the only way to be
certain

HENRY
Nothings certain

ISHERWOOD

Maybe not but Dain rescued me from
purgatory For the good of all
mankind he has chosen to make himself
the devil the rest of us cannot choose
to be but he is a merciful devil

It is a warning Only one question
remains will you heed it

EHLY
The Generator is still running Why
havent you shut it down

FAULKNER

That would ruin the experiment
EHLY

Experiment
RENNAUD

Originally divergent realities only
lasted microseconds before collapse
but the longer the generator runs
the more energy and thus the longer
the divergence it can produce

FAULKNER
This ones been running five years

HENRY
Whats the endgame

FAULKNER
Sustainable divergent realities
Parallel universes that last as long
as we want them to We can play out
every possible path to its conclusion
before committing to one

Now I know what youre thinking
Two words playing and God

EHLY

I had two different words but perhaps
we best go with yours

I say Gods the one whos playing
Shit happens isnt just a bumper

Almighty Just ask your son

Are you telling me you can do better
