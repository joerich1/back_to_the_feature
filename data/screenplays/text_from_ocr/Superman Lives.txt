past ALARM sounding People screaming and --

PULL BACK TO SHOW

KRYPTONIAN CORRIDOR Packed with fleeing CITIZENS Their
garb and architecture bespeak a highly advanced culture -- an
enlightened civilization at the moment reduced to pure terror
as FAMILIES LOVERS and CHILDREN run down the hall and --

ANGLE ON

JOR-EL Regal Handsome Tunic bearing the distinctive s
of his clan He rushes down the corridor with the CROWD

sees a young GIRL get knocked down JOR-EL pauses to lift the
GIRL to her feet glances up at the reflective eye-like
DEVICE coldly staring down at the panicked mass of humanity
hurries on as --

An unGodly terrifying SQUEALING sound suddenly fills the
corridor The CROWD shrieks Lights flicker The SQUEALING
sound is getting louder and louder Something’s approaching
from behind PEOPLE start stampeding forward JOR-EL joins
the mad dash to get away from it as a commotion is suddenly
heard up ahead and --

JOR-EL’S POV

A BARRICADE begins to close across the corridor barring their
escape JOR-EL follows the surge of PEOPLE pushing toward the
rapidly narrowing gap - SQUEALING sound getting louder and
louder behind him -- the sharp metal edges of the BARRICADE
about to close up ahead and - JOR-EL dives through -- slides
across the floor as the heavy barricade doors seal shut behind
him Muffled SCREAMS are heard on the other side as some
unseen BEAST crashes with massive strength into the closed
doors -- leaves its horrific outline in the solid steel and --

JOR-EL’S LABORATORY Complex controls and instruments abound
ALARM heard OVER JOR-EL bursts in --

JOR-EL
Lara
LARA appears from the shadows holding their infant SON
Tremors rock the room He takes her hand --

LARA
We must get to the transports

JOR-EL
(moving across the lab)
Theyve been destroyed

The lab suddenly goes dark Dim emergency lights activate
A shaft of light slices through the gloom to --

REVEAL

A CHILLING SIGHT -- a large humanoid HEAD seems to hover in
the darkness -- prominent cranium greenish metallic skin
stretched over sparking relays soul-less eyes -- the rest of
its body hidden in deep shadow --

JOR-EL
Brainiac
(stunned)
How --

BRAINIAC
Your mistake was you started me
but didn’t finish me

BRAINIAC’S head moves spectre-like through the darkness JOR-
EL and LARA holding the CHILD instinctively back away

BRAINIAC

If only you’d assisted my growth
instead of crudely trying to end
my existence

(focused on the INFANT)
You chose to spend time on that
drooling useless thing when you
could have been refining me

JOR-EL
Your program is flawed you must
know that

BRAINIAC

I have evolved far beyond your
comprehension Jor-El -- the
creation has become the creator

A large COMPUTERLIKE DEVICE begins to glow in a corner of
the room -- its powerful pulsating green aura illuminating a
myriad of cables and connections running into the floor --
BRAINIAC
All of Krypton’s thermionic systems
are now under my control For
crimes against technology your
world will die at technology’s hand

Powerful tremors rock the room - structural debris rains from
the ceiling -- JOR-EL edges away - trying to buy time --

JOR-EL
You say you’ve evolved Then
display your higher instincts
and show mercy

BRAINIAC
Nothing of this planet shall
endure -- except Brainiac

JOR-EL
You can destroy Krypton but not
its people Our line will
continue I’ve made sure of that

BRAINIAC
Enough stalling Jor-El
(moving toward the INFANT)
Let the death of your child be
the last thing you see

JOR-EL dives for a wall carved with niches -- grabs an
advanced Kryptonian lab tool -- fires the powerful implement
at BRAINIAC -- explosion of LIGHT and --

cuT TO

LAB LAUNCH AREA A silo-like space dominated by a stealth-
shaped SPACE CRAFT JOR-EL rushes in with LARA and the
INFANT locks the door behind JOR-EL takes their SON and --

INFANT’S POV

HANDS hurriedly place us inside the space craft’s wonderous
interior wrap us in a familiar blue and red fabric A
mysterious Rubik’s cube-like OBJECT is placed by our side
and then two anguished faces appear -- JOR-EL and LARA
looking in through the hatch -

LARA
Where will you send him

JOR-EL
The planet Earth Its yellow sun
will give him tremendous physical
advantages He will be safe there
JOR-EL reaches in takes the child’s hand --

JOR-EL
God speed my son --

LARA
(tears rolling down)

A commotion behind -- LARA screams as she’s suddenly pulled
from the hatch -- JOR-EL struggles with something in the BG --
the hatch seals shut and --

BRAINIAC suddenly appears at the portal -- looks in -- sees
the INFANT -- a mechanical appendage suddenly bangs on the
window clutching a bloody S -- the loud sound of ROCKETS
being fired are heard -- the craft vibrates as it accelerates
upward - the view through the portal changes as the ship
races from Krypton and enters the infinite blackness of SPACE
-- the CHILD’S cries fill the craft’s lonely interior as a
booming VOICE seems to fill the heavens --

BRAINIAC (OVER)
IF IT TAKES ALL ETERNITY I WILL
FIND YOU KAL-EL

That’s it -- room’s full

unmussed LOIS LANE through to the front --

moves his hand watches as LOIS goes to the front of the room
stands against the wall MORRIS appears on-stage walks to a
podium bearing the LEXCORP logo and the slogan --

LEXCORP -- TOMORROW’S TECHNOLOGY TODAY

MORRIS
Good morning It’s my great honor
and pleasure to introduce a man
whose vision and brilliance is
matched only by his -- his -

MORRIS forgets his lines searches his jacket for his notes --

ANGLE ON

LEX in the wings angrily mouths “charity and kindness --
MORRIS
(finding his cue card reading)
- Charity and kindness Without
further ado I give you a titan of
industry civic leader and patron
of the arts -- Mr Lex Luthor

MORRIS backs away clapping as LEX takes the stage goes to
the podium smiles as he looks around the room -—

LEX
Well I understand we have press
representatives here today from over
20 countries I guarantee you’1ll
be glad you came Before getting
to the momentous news behind this
gathering however I’d like to
take a moment to fill our overseas
journalists in on some of the
pertinent facts about our company

LEX straightens proudly --

LEX
Lexcorp is the world’s leader in
satellite communications and space
launch systems with 34 flawless
lift-offs this year alone

LOIS looks around sees FOREIGN REPORTERS dutifully scribbling
what LEX says --

LEX
This includes our most recent
launch of a re-usable space
vehicle that will allow Lexcorp
to ferry nuclear waste to the
moon dump it and return with
valuable minerals and ore A good
deal for Lexcorp and mankind

LoIs
(unable to take any more calling out)
Then why is it the Atomic Energy
Commission recently categorized
your plan as grossly ill-conceived

LEX
(tight smile)
»-We haven’t reached the query
portion of the press conference
Miss Lane

LOIS
It’s a fact not a question As
far back as your early days in the
garbage industry Lexcorp’s had a
dismal safety record Why should
we believe this will be different

LEX

I could arrange for you to accompany
the first flight Miss Lane

(to himself)
And leave you there

(continuing to the room)
Now then Lexcorp is also launching
satellites to make way for more tv
channels and varied viewing pleasure

LOIs
(raising her hand)
Would this programming be anything
like the mature entertainment
you used to sell on the internet

The FOREIGN JOURNALISTS jot down LOIS’S words LEX’S eye
‘starts to twitch as he quickly moves to regain control --

LEX
Ladies gentlemen -- and Miss Lane
I was going to give a run-down of
Lexcorp highlights before getting
to the meat of this meeting but
as Miss Lane is itching to get to
the bottom line I’11 make the
announcement now The Lexcorp
re-usable space vehicle has an
advanced imaging capability to
scan the lunar surface for ore and
minerals To test the vehicle’s
sensors we first aimed it at our
planet Ladies and gentlemen
that ship has identified evidence
of an extraterrestrial craft’s
arrival on Earth

The room erupts in questions and as it does we begin a slow
CAMERA PULL toward the back of the crowded room --

REPORTER 1
UF0 When did it land

LEX
From what we can tell approximately
30 years ago

REPORTER 2
Has it been unearthered

LEX
A team is digging as we speak

CLARK

was this evidence found

LEX
Smallville not far from here

CLARK absorbs the news mind racing pen frozen over pad -

CLARK
Is it possible your satellite mis-
read the data Maybe it’s a sink
hole or some geological anomaly --

CLARK’S droning is drowned out by more shouting He sinks to
his seat HOLD on him through the following --

REPORTER (OVER)
Jed Riviera The Star -- is there
any evidence this is the craft that
brought Elvis to our planet

LEX (OVER)
I’d bet something hitched a ride
but get up to Smallville and see
for yourselves And when you’re
reporting the science find of the
millenium -- don’t forget it was
brought to you by Lexcorp

The room quickly begins to empty REPORTERS rushing out LEX
moves triumphantly off-stage passes LOIS stops --

LEX
I admire yourspunk Lois There
might be an opening for you in my
organization Shorter hours than
reporting better pay and less

CLARK nears the edge of the pit stands beside LOIS looks
down watches the SCIENTISTS digging away --

LoIs
It’s probably just some buried
tractor or car or something --

LOIS freezes as the SCIENTISTS suddenly unearth a large
FRAGMENT of what appears to be a sharp angled space craft
Hieroglyphs and symbols cover the outside Though buried for
years the fragment’s unique metal shines like new

Eureka

The SCIENTISTS practically fall to their knees in wonder --

SCIENTIST 2

Would you care to be alone
LOIS
No -- I mean stay please I’ve

been hoping to see you

LOIS approaches in the moonlight SUPERMAN in near darkness
his face the only thing seen --

LoIs
You always come and go so quickly
There’s something I’ve been meaning
to tell you something I’ve wanted
to say for a long time

I love a guy in tights

And LOIS plants one on SUPERMAN -- long and passionate She

Sounds good but I’ve got an idea
Instead of another take-out atop

through the rain forest how about
just a quiet night at my place

SUPERMAN

I could do that every night Lois

See each other every night

I’m saying I’d like to see you
more often

SUPERMAN

Right It’s just given what I

important it is Including you

thought a lot about you

We’ve been seeing each other for
over a year and I realized that
while I know your heart I know
your spirit I don’t really know
any more about you now than I did
when we first met I don’t know
where you come from where you go
I don’t even know where you live

SUPERMAN
There’s reasons Lois Someday
you’1ll understand

LoIs
I understand there’s two of you
and I love you too much to watch
you lock half of yourself away
You can lift mountains -- why
can’t you talk to me

’ SUPERMAN
--I wish I could say

A gust blows over the roof It suddenly feels cold --

LorIs
I’ve got a lot to think about
Maybe we should do this another
night

SUPERMAN silent LOIS kisses him continues past She opens

the future includes a myriad of
revolutionary Lexcorp technolgies

TELEVISION STUDIO SAME TIME The TV CAMERA pulls back to
show LEXIAC sitting beside the show’s HOST --

HOST

Mister Luthor Let’s be frank
Many people see your company as

a mere front for a far-reaching
criminal enterprise Opponents
insist it’s only a matter of time
before you and your confederates
try to capitalize on Superman’s
death Your reaction

MORRIS stands watching in the wings winces at the question --

LEXIAC
--I’m here to discuss the future
(looking directly at the camera)
A future where flawed heros are
replaced by marvels of science and
technology

The CAMERA pulls back to reveal a round reflective eye-like
DEVICE set on a stand -- vi we saw --

LEXIAC
This is a thermionic transfer port
a device which will allow a user to
telepathically send and receive data
via the insertion of a small cranial
implant Thought communication will
be possible anywhere on the globe

HOST
very intriguing Mister Luthor
Let’s see what our second guest
Daily Planet reporter Lois Lane
has to say about it Miss Lane --

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to show LOIS seated beside LEXIAC --

LOIs
I think Mr Luthor’s in need of a
cranial implant My God we can’t
even trust him to take out the
trash much less tap into our
thoughts

LEXIAC
The technology is at hand Miss
Lane And I will administer it

LOIs
Where did it come from What
are the risks My readers want
answers Mr Luthor and you’re
not going to administer anything
until we get then

LEXIAC glares at LOIS A spark suddenly arcs between his chin
and the small microphone in his lapel --

HOST
(reaching for LEXIAC’S mike)
I’m sorry Mr Luthor It must be
some sort of short-circuit --

LEXTIAC
(swatting his hand away to LOIS)
This device is a gift Your
insolence aside the vast majority
of people will embrace it My
advances will allow everyone to
find the super-being within

LoIs
Supermans strength came from his

heart not from the kind of high-
tech gadgets your peddling

Yes well his heart’s not giving
him much strength now is it

reveal the badly damaged machine -- countdown stopped at 15
seconds --

CLOSE ON

LEXIAC His skin starts to ripple Joints expand His
entire form contorting wildly as -- BRAINIAC suddenly emerges
from LEXIAC’S body and --

BRAINIAC is suddenly seen exposed fully for the first time --
no cape - just a head on an horrific mechanical body -- it
rises up thrashing -- connects with SUPERMAN -- slams him back
-- sends him sprawling to the floor --

BRAINIAC
(standing over him)
Seen mom and dad lately

SUPERMAN
As a matter of fact I have and
I’ve got a message from them --
(leaping up grabbing him)

SUPERMAN starts bending and twisting the creature’s very
armature as BRAINIAC emits mechanical sounding squeals --
SUPERMAN hurls him to the floor -- again and again -- BRAINIAC
struggling -- bent and broken SUPERMAN hurls him over the
balcony -- down to the floor below and --

ANGLE ON

BRAINIAC’S frame smashes into a hundred pieces The head is
separated from the body Lying there Unmoving Beat His
eyes suddenly open Sick smile The head rolls quickly
across the floor to the damaged DEVICE - connects itself to
the machine and -- the countdown clock suddenly resumes -- 14
seconds - 13 -- 12 seconds left until the NUCLEAR MISSLES on
the screens are launched and --

SUPERMAN dives down -- grasps BRAINIAC’S head -- tries to pull
it from the DEVICE -- clock down to 10 seconds -- 9 -- 8 --
the wall of SCREENS showing dozens of MISSILES preparing for
lift-off -- SUPERMAN uses a final burst of strength -- rips
BRAINIAC’S HEAD from the device with only 2 seconds left --
the clock stops -- the DEVICE powers do -

SUPERMAN is about to punch the head into oblivion when
BRAINIAC shoots out an intense final burst of energy that
beams directly into SUPERMAN’S eyes -- SUPERMAN stumbles back
clutching his eyes suddenly convulses and --

CLOSE ON

SUPERMAN’S skin begins to ripple his features contorting as
if possessed -- BRAINIAC’S entered his body -- SUPERMAN fights
the force with all his will -- his joints twisting horribly --
BRAINIAC trying to kill him from within --

LoIs
He can’t beat you Superman

SUPERMAN looks at her ravaged with pain --

LoIs
You have too much to live for
(eyes locked with his)
You’re going to be a father --

SUPERMAN closes his eyes -- everything focused within -- his
body pulsating from the battle of wills as he uses every bit
of mental emotional and spiritual energy he has to shoot the
beam back into BRAINIAC’S head -- nearly collapses from the
effort --

BRAINIAC’S HEAD
(eyes blinking open staring at SUPERMAN)
You alwaysruineverything --

SUPERMAN picks up the head -- punches it into the wall --
shatters it into a thousand pieces -- BRAINAIC’S dead --

ANGLE ON

LEX comes to on the balcony He stands -- the same American
flag thong that was seen when he was consumed is his only
covering -- no memory of what’s happened happened since --

LEX
--I was about to have a massage --

LoIs
(leoking skyward)
