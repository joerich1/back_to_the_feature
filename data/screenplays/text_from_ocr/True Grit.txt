TRUE GRIT

Adaptation by

Joel and Ethan Coen

Based on the Novel by Charles Portis

June 12 2009
White letters on a black screen
The wicked flee when none pursueth
The quotation fades
A womans voice

Voice-Over
People do not give it credence that a young girl
could leave
home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her
fathers
blood but it did happen

The street of a western town night The street is deserted
Snow falls

We track slowly forward

I was just fourteen years of age when a coward by
the name

of Tom Chaney shot my father down in Fort Smith

Arkansas and robbed him of his life and his
horse and two

California gold pieces that he carried in his
trouser band

A shape lies in the street below the busted-out porch railing of
a two-story building A
sign identifies the building as the Monarch Boarding House

Papa was a Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason
Hed
hired Chaney--for paid wages not on shares--when
Chaney

was down on his luck If Papa had a failing it
was his

kindly disposition I did not get my mean streak
from him

The crumpled shape is a body We hear the thunder of approaching
hooves

He had taken Chaney up to Fort Smith to help lead
back a

string of mustang ponies hed just bought from a
stock trader

named Stonehill In town Chaney had fallen to
drink and

cards and lost all his money He got it into his
head hed

been cheated and went back to the boarding house
for his

Henry rifle Papa remonstrated and Chaney shot
him in the

breast

A galloping horse enters frame and recedes whipped on by a
bareback rider A long-
barreled rifle is tied across the riders back with a sash cord

He disappears into the falling snow
Chaney fled He could have taken the time to
saddle the
horse--or hitched up three spans of mules to a
Concord

stagecoach and smoked a pipe as it seems that no
one in that

city was inclined to give chase Chaney had
mistaken its

citizens for men

DAY
We are looking into the window of a moving train

Looking out past us is a fourteen-year-old girl Mattie Ross
Next to her is Yarnell a

middle-aged black man Reading backward in the mirror of the
window we see a station

sign easing in as the train slows FORT SMITH
The voice-over continues

Voice-Over
You might say what business was it of my fathers

to

meddle My answer is this he was trying to do
that short

devil a good turn He was his brothers keeper
Does that

answer your question

DEAD MANS FACE
Candlelight flickers over the mans waxy features
Voice
(Irish-accented)

Is that the man

The body wrapped in a shroud lies in a pine coffin Mattie and

Yarnell stand looking

down at it An undertaker grizzled and severely dressed holds

the candle

Yarnell
Lord lord

Mattie
That is my father

Undertaker
If you would loik to kiss him it would be all roight

Yarnell
He has gone home Praise the lord

Mattie
Put the lid on Why is it so much

Undertaker

The quality of the casket and of the embalming The loifloik
appearance requires time and art And the chemicals come
dear The particulars are in your bill If you would loik to
kiss him it would be all roight

Mattie
No Thank you The spirit has flown Your wire said fifty
dollars
Undertaker
You did not specify he was to be shipped

Mattie
Well sixty dollars is every cent we have It leaves nothing
for our board Yarnell you can see to the bodys transport to
the train station and accompany it home and I will have to
sleep here tonight

Yarnell
I dont think your mamad want you to stay in this town by
yourself
Mattie

It cant be helped I still have to collect fathers things and
see to some other business

Yarnell
But Is your chap-a-rone Your mama didnt say for you to
see to no business here

Mattie
It is business Mama doesnt know about Its all right
Yarnell I dismiss you

Yarnell
Well Im not sure I--
Mattie
Tell mama not to sign anything until I return home
and see
that Papa is buried in his masons apron
To the undertaker
-Your terms are agreeable if I may pass the
night here
Undertaker
Here Among these people
Mattie looks around the empty room
Mattie
These people
Undertaker
I am expecting three more souls Sullivan Smith
and His

Tongue In The Rain
Mattie
How is it that you know in advance

GALLOWS

Three men stand upon a rough-hewn three-banger gallows The
condemned are two white

men and an Indian They wear new jeans and flannel shirts
buttoned to the neck Each has

a noose around his neck One of the white men is addressing the
crowd

Man

Ladies and gentlemen beware and train up your
children in

the way that they should go You see what has
become of

me because of drink I killed a man in a trifling
quarrel over

a pocketknife

Mattie is pushing her way through the spectators thronging the
town square

Up on the gallows the condemned speaker starts to weep

Man

If I had received good instruction as a child I
would be with

my wife and children today away out on the
Cimarron

River I dont know what is to become of them I
hope and

pray that you will not slight them and compel them
to go into

low company

His blubbering will not let him go on He steps back A man
standing by slips a black
hood over his head which continues to bob with sobbing

Mattie hisses to a woman nearby

Mattie
Can you point out the sheriff

The woman indicates a figure among the officiators on the
scaffold

Woman
Him with the mustaches

The second condemned man is speaking

Man
Well I killed the wrong man is the which-of-why
Im here
Had I killed the man I meant to I dont believe I
would a

been convicted I see men out there in that crowd
is worse
than me
A thinking pause He nods shrugging
Okay
He steps back and is hooded

The third man steps forward

Indian
I would like to say--

He is hooded speech cut short The hangman hand to his elbow
helps him step back

The executioner pulls a lever on the scaffold Three trapdoors
swing open and three men
drop They hit the end of their ropes with a crack

Crowd
on
Two of the men have their heads snapped to an angle and are limp
and twist slowly One
though writhes and kicks jackknifing his legs
Man
Oh Sullivan muster lost weight in prison His
neck aint
broke

Sullivan continues to writhe and kick

Voice
Hot tamales

Mattie looks down at a boy selling hot tamales out of a bucket

Ten cents
LATER

Mattie is talking to the sheriff whom we saw officiating on the
scaffold The square is

emptying and

in the background all three men twist slowly the

last man having finally
given up the ghost The Mexican boy still hawks tamales to

stragglers

him he lit out

in with

Chaney is the

staffed and
a long list of

Sheriff
No we aint arrested him Aint caught up to

for the Territory I would think he has throwed

Lucky Ned Pepper whose gang robbed a mail hack
yesterday on the Poteau River

Mattie
Why are you not looking for him

Sheriff
I have no authority in the Indian Nation Tom

business of the US marshals now

Mattie
When will they arrest him

Sheriff
Not soon I am afraid The marshals are not well

I will tell you frankly Chaney is at the end of

fugitives and malefactors

Mattie
Could I hire a marshal to pursue Tom Chaney

The sheriff looks at the girl and chuckles

here to

Sheriff
You have a lot of experience with bounty hunters

Mattie
My answer is this That is a silly question I am

Sheriff
All alone

Mattie
I am the person for it Mama was never any good

and she can hardly spell cat I intend to see
hanged

Sheriff
I see Well Nothing prevents you from offering a

or from so informing a marshal It would have to
money though to be persuasive Chaney is across
in the Choctaw Nation--lawless country It will
daisy-picking expedition Upwards of three-score
marshals have been slaughtered in the Territory

Mattie
I will see to the money Whos the best marshal

Sheriff
I would have to weigh that proposition I reckon

Waters is the best tracker He is half Comanche
something to see him cut for sign The meanest
Rooster Cogburn He is a pitiless man double
fear dont enter into his thinking He loves to
The best is probably LT Quinn he brings his
alive He may let one get by now and again but he
even the worst of men is entitled to a fair

good peace officer and a lay preacher to boot He
plant evidence or abuse a prisoner He is as

string Yes I will say Quinn is about the best
Mattie
Where can I find this Rooster

MATTIES HAND
Rapping at a door of rough plank
After a beat a voice--rasping and slurred

Voice
The jakes is occupied

Wider We see that Mattie stands before an outhouse

Mattie
I know it is occupied Mr Cogburn As I said I
have
business with you
Beat
Voice
I have prior business
Mattie
You have been at it for quite some time Mr
Cogburn

Voice
(roaring drunk)
There is no clock on my business To hell with
you To hell
with you How did you stalk me here

Mattie
The sheriff told me to look in the saloon In the
saloon they
referred me here We must talk

Voice
(outraged)
Women aint allowed in the saloon

Mattie
I was not there as a customer I am fourteen

years old

No response Mattie reaches up and raps again vigorously
Beat

Voice
(sullen)
The jakes is occupied And will be for some time

PLANK FLOOR

A coffin is dropped heavily into frame and we see chalked onto
the freshly milled wood of
its top

Ross
Yell County
Hold at station

After a resting beat during which the coffins handlers
presumably adjust their grip the

coffin is shoved away over the straw-littered planking of a rail
freight car Once it has

been pushed fully in the upright planking of the boxcar door
blurs through frame in the

extreme foreground til the door slams to rest

We hear the steam engine start to chug and the foreground door
moves Slowly off with the
grinding motion of the train

SHOP DOOR
Swinging open It is the barnlike door to the morticians
workroom the Irish undertaker

holds it open for Mattie She carries a bedroll

Undertaker
You can sleep in a coffin if you loik

Three bodies lay under shrouds on a high work table The arm of
the nearest sticks out
rope burns on its wrist Three coffins are in various stages of
assembly
Mattie unwinds the bedroll onto the floor
Mattie
Not yet

STREET

Mattie strides along looking at facades She stops looking at
the signage on a barnlike

building

Col G Stonehill Licensed Auctioneer Cotton
Factor
INSIDE

Mattie steps to the doorway of an office set in a corner of the
stable

Mattie
How much are you paying for cotton

Stonehill looks up from his desk He eyes the girl up and down

Stonehill
Nine and a half for low middling and ten for
ordinary
Mattie
We got most of ours out early and sold it to
Woodson
Brothers in Little Rock for eleven cents
Stonehill
Then I suggest you take the balance of it to the
Woodson
Brothers
Mattie
We took the balance to Woodson We got ten anda
half

Stonehill
Why did you come here to tell me this

Mattie
I thought we might shop around up here next year
but I guess
we are doing all right in Little Rock I am
Mattie Ross
daughter of Frank Ross

Stonehill sets his pen down and leans back

Stonehill
A tragic thing May I say your father impressed

me with his

acted

father

manly qualities He was a close trader but he
the
gentleman

Mattie
I propose to sell those ponies back to you that my
bought

Stonehill
That I fear is out of the question I will see

that they are

those

it I

horse

stole

care

that I am not

shipped to you at my earliest convenience

Mattie
We dont want the ponies now We dont need them

Stonehill
Well that hardly concerns me Your father bought
five
ponies and paid for them and there is an end of
have the
bill of sale
Beat
Mattie
And I want three hundred dollars for Papas saddle
that
was stolen from your stable
Stonehill
You will have to take that up with the man who
the
horse
Mattie
Tom Chaney stole the horse while it was in your
You

are responsible
Stonehill chuckles

Stonehill
admire your sand but I believe you will find

liable for such claims

Mattie
You were custodian If you were a bank and were
robbed

you could not simply tell the depositors to go
hang

Stonehill
I do not entertain hypotheticals the world as it
is is vexing
enough Secondly your valuation of the horse is
high by
about two hundred dollars How old are you

Mattie

If anything my price is low Judy is a fine
racing mare She

has won purses of twenty-five dollars I have
seen her jump

an eight-rail fence with a heavy rider I am
fourteen

Stonehill

Hmm Well thats all very interesting The
ponies are

yours take them Your fathers horse was stolen
by a

murderous criminal I had provided reasonable
protection

for the creature as per our implicit agreement
My watchman

had his teeth knocked out and can take only soup

We must
each bear his own misfortunes
Mattie
I will take it to law
Stonehill
You have no case
Mattie
Lawyer J Noble Daggett of Dardanelle Arkansas
may think
otherwise--as might a jury petitioned by a widow
and three

small children

Stonehill
Where is your mother

Mattie
sister

You ar

you ma

agreem

estate

absolv

She is at home in Yell County looking after my

Victoria and my brother Little Frank
Stonehill
I cannot make an agreement with a minor child
e not
accountable
Mattie
Lawyer Dagget will back up any decision I make
y
rest easy on that score You can confirm any
ent by

telegraph
Stonehill stares

Stonehill
I will pay two hundred dollars to your fathers
when I
have in my hand a letter from your lawyer
ing me of

all liability from the beginning of the world to date The
offer is more than liberal and I make it only to avoid the
possibility of troublesome litigation

Mattie
will take two hundred dollars for Judy plus one hundred
for the ponies and twenty-five dollars for the gray horse that
Tom Chaney left He is easily worth forty That is three
hundred twenty-five dollars total

Stonehill
The ponies have no part of this I will not buy them
Mattie
Then the price for Judy is three hundred twenty-five dollars
Stonehill
would not pay three hundred and twenty-five dollars for
winged Pegasus As for the gray horse it does not belong to
you And you are a snip

Mattie
The gray was lent to Tom Chaney by my father Chaney
only had the use of him Your other points are beneath
comment

Stonehill
I will pay two hundred and twenty-five dollars and keep the
gray horse I dont want the ponies

Mattie
I cannot accept that (she stands) There can be no
settlement after I leave this office It will go to law

Stonehill
This is my last offer Two hundred and fifty dollars For
that I get the release previously discussed and I keep your
fathers saddle I am also writing off a feed and stabling
charge The gray horse is not yours to sell You are an
unnatural child

Mattie
The saddle is not for sale I will keep it Lawyer Dagget can
prove ownership of the gray horse He will come after you
with a writ of replevin

Stonehill

A what All right now listen very carefully as I
will not

bargain further I will take the ponies back and
keep the gray

horse which is mine and settle for three hundred
dollars

Now you must take that or leave it and I do not
much care

which it is

Mattie
Lawyer Daggett would not wish me to consider
anything
under three hundred twenty-five dollars But I
will settle for
three hundred and twenty if I am given the twenty

in
advance And here is what I have to say about the
saddle--
STREET
We are tracking down the street we toward the Monarch Boarding
House

Mattie is humping a saddle up the street She stops before the
boarding house She looks
at its sign She looks at its busted-out porch railing

A blanket is unrolled to reveal a watch a cheap knife and a
long-barreled Colts dragoon
revolver Voice off

Mrs Floyd

This was in the poor mans room This is
everything there

something for

flour sack for

DARK ROOM

We hear wind whistling through cracks in the floorboards and
walls

We hear snoring

There is one bed not large with two shapes in it

We cut in closer to find Mattie lying on her back staring She
shivers shoulders hunched

The thin blanket barely covers her

She pulls the blanket gently slowly so that it covers her
exposed side

A beat of snoring a snorfle and then as we hold on Mattie
the crackle of mattress ticking

under a shifting body--and the blanket is pulled away toward the
unseen snorer

COURT HALLWAY

Voices echo from inside the courtroom Mattie cracks a heavy oak
door and slips in
COURTROOM

The gallery is crowded Mattie is at the back of a press of
standees

Her point-of-view semi-obstructed on the witness stand is
Rooster Cogburn a rough-
hewn man going to middle-aged fat He has a patch over one eye

Cogburn

The woman was out in the yard dead with blowflies
on her

face and the old man was inside with his breast
blowed open

by a scatter-gun and his feet burned He was
still alive but

just was He said them two Wharton boys had done

it rode
up drunk--
Mr Goudy
Objection Hearsay
Mr Barlow
Dying declaration your honor
Judge
Overruled Procede Mr Cogburn
Cogburn
Them two Wharton boys--thatd be Odus and CC--
throwed down on him asked him where his money
was

when he wouldnt talk lit pine knots and held em
to his feet

He told em in a fruit jar under a gray rock at
one corner of

the smokehouse

Mr Barlow
And then

Cogburn
Well he died on us Passed away in considerable pain

Mr Barlow
What did you do then

Cogburn
Me and Marshal Potter went out to the smokehouse and that

rock had been moved and that jar was gone

Mr Goudy
Objection Speculative

Judge
Sustained

Mr Barlow
You found a flat gray rock at the corner of the smokehouse
with a hollowed-out space under it

Mr Goudy
If the prosecutor is going to give evidence I suggest that he
be sworn

Mr Barlow
Marshal Cogburn what did you find if anything at the
corner of the smokehouse

Cogburn
We found a flat gray rock with a hollowed-out space under
it Nothin there

Mr Barlow
And what did--

Cogburn
No jar or nothin

Mr Barlow
What did you do then

Cogburn
Well we rode up to the Whartons near where the North
Fork strikes the Canadian branch of the Canadian

Mr Barlow
And what did you find

Cogburn
I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old
daddy Aaron Wharton down there on the creek bank with
some hogs Theyd killed a shoat and was butchering it
Theyd built a fire under a wash pot for scalding water

Mr Barlow
What did you do

Cogburn
Crept down I announced that we was US marshals and
hollered to Aaron that we needed to talk to his boys He
picked up a axe and commenced to cussing us and
blackguarding this court

Mr Barlow
What did you do then

Cogburn
Backed away trying to talk some sense into him But CC
edges over by the wash pot and picks up a shotgun Potter
seen him but it was too late CC Wharton pulled down on
Potter with one barrel and then turned to do the same for me
with the other I shot him and when the old man swung the
axe I shot him Odus lit out and I shot him Aaron Wharton
and CC Wharton was dead when they hit the ground but
Odus was just winged

Mr Barlow
Did you find the jar with the hundred and twenty dollars in

it

Mr Goudy
Leading

Judge
Sustained

Mr Barlow
What happened then

Cogburn
I found the jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it

Mr Barlow
And what happened to Marshal Potter

Cogburn
Died Leaves a wife and six babies

Mr Goudy
Objection

Judge
Strike the comment

Mr Barlow
And what became of Odus Wharton

Cogburn
There he sets

Mr Barlow

Okay You may ask Mr Goudy

Mr Goudy
Thank you Mr Barlow In your four years as US marshal
Mr Cogburn how many men have you shot

Mr Barlow
Objection

Mr Goudy
There is more to this shooting than meets the eye Judge
Parker I will establish the bias of this witness

Judge
Objection is overruled
Mr Goudy
How many Mr Cogburn

Cogburn
I never shot nobody I didnt have to
Mr Goudy
That was not the question How many
Cogburn
Shot or killed
Mr Goudy
Let us restrict it to killed so that we may have a
manageable figure
Cogburn
Around twelve or fifteen Stopping men in flight
defending

myself et cetera

Mr Goudy
Around twelve or fifteen So many that you cannot keep a
precise count Remember you are under oath I have
examined the records and can supply the accurate figure

Beat

Cogburn
I believe them two Whartons make twenty-three

Mr Goudy
Twenty-three dead men in four years

Cogburn

It is a dangerous business

Mr Goudy
How many members of this one family the Wharton family
have you killed

Cogburn
Immediate or--

Mr Barlow
Your honor perhaps counsel should be advised that the
marshal is not the defendant in this action

Mr Barlow
The history is relevant your honor Goes to Cogburns
methods and animosities

Judge
Okay

Mr Barlow
Did you also shoot Dub Wharton brother and Clete
Wharton half-brother

Cogburn
Clete was selling ardent spirits to the Cherokee He come at
me with a king bolt

Mr Goudy
You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing but
a king bolt From a wagon tongue

Cogburn
Ive seen men badly tore up with things no bigger than a
king bolt I defended myself

Mr Goudy
And returning to the encounter with Aaron and his two
remaining sons you sprang from cover with your revolver in
hand

Cogburn
I did
Mr Goudy
Loaded and cocked
Cogburn

If it aint loaded and cocked it dont shoot

Mr Goudy

And like his son Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed
man

Cogburn
He was armed He had that axe raised

Mr Goudy
Yes I believe you testified that you backed away from
Aaron Wharton

Cogburn
That is right

Mr Goudy
Which direction were you going

Cogburn
I always go backwards when Im backing up

Mr Goudy
Very amusing I suppose--for all of us except Aaron
Wharton Now he advanced upon you much in the manner
of Clete Wharton menacing you with that king bolt or rolled-
up newspaper or whatever it was

Cogburn
Yes sir He commenced to cussing and laying about with
threats

Mr Goudy
And you were backing away How many steps before the
shooting started

Cogburn
Seven eight steps

Mr Goudy
Aaron Wharton keeping pace advancing away from the fire
seven eight steps--what would that be fifteen twenty feet

Cogburn
I suppose

Mr Goudy
Will you explain to the jury Mr Cogburn why Mr Wharton
was found immediately by the wash pot with one arm in the
fire his sleeve and hand smoldering

Cogburn
Well

Mr Goudy
Did you move the body after you shot him

Cogburn
Why would I do that

Mr Goudy
You did not drag his body over to the fire Fling
his arm in

Cogburn
No sir

Mr Goudy
Two witnesses who arrived on the scene will
testify to the
location of the body You do not remember moving
the
body So it was a bushwack as he tended his
campfire

Mr Barlow
Objection

Cogburn
I if that was where the body was I might have
moved him I
do not remember

Mr Goudy
Why would you move the body Mr Cogburn

Cogburn
Them hogs rooting around might have moved him I
do not
remember

EVENING--BOARDING HOUSE PORCH

Mattie climbs the few steps from the street Her attention is
drawn by

A man sitting on a chair to one side enjoying the quiet of the
evening He is dressed for

riding with perhaps a bit too much panache It is almost dark
and he is hard to see but it

seems he is watching Mattie amused

He raises a pipe to his mouth and pulls at it The glow from the
excited bowl kicks on his
eyes which are indeed tracking her

Mattie discomfited by his look turns hastily forward and
pushes open the door A
jingling sound prompts one more glance to the side

The mans face is now hidden by his hat Just before Matties
point of view now a lateral

track starts to lose him behind the door jamb he raises a
spurred boot to push against the

porch rail and tip his chair back He raises his other foot
spur jingling and drapes it over

the first

INSIDE
We are pushing in on the landlady

Landlady
Isnt your mother expecting you home dear I
did not think
to see you this evening

Mattie
My business is not yet finished Mrs Floyd
have any rooms
opened up Grandma Turner the bed is quite
narrow

Landlady
The second-floor back did open up but the
gentleman on the

porch has just taken it But dont worry
yourself dear--you

are not disturbing Grandma Turner

DARK BEDROOM

As before unseen Grandma Turner snores loudly as wind whistles
and Mattie shivers

Fade to black
Very quiet

In the quiet a faint crickle-crackle of flame It is followed
by a lip-pop and a deep inhale

Mattie opens her eyes She is beaded with sweat She looks
blearily up

The room is dim A man sits facing her in a straghtback chair
faintly backlit by the

daylight leaking through the curtained window behind him He
exhales pipesmoke

Cowboy
You are sleeping the day away

Mattie
I am not well

The man rises and spurs jingling crosses to the window and
throws open the curtain

Mattie squints at him against the daylight

The man has a cowlick and barndoor ears and is once again well-
accoutered for riding He
steps away from the window and reseats himself

Cowboy
You do not look well My name is LeBoeuf I have
just
come from Yell County

Mattie
We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County
LeBoeuf

A saucy line will not get you far with me I saw
your mother

yesterday morning She says for you to come right
on home

Mattie
Hm What was your business there

LeBoeuf takes a small photograph from his coat

LeBoeuf
This is a man I think you know

Mattie looks at the picture through red-rimmed eyes
You called him Tom Chaney I believe

Mattie declines to contradict LeBoeuf continues

though in the months I have been tracking

him he has

place
Mattie
Why did you not catch him in Monroe Louisiana or
Pine
Bluff Arkansas

LeBoeuf
He is a crafty one
Mattie

I thought him slow-witted myself

LeBoeuf
That was his act

Mattie
It was a good one Are you some kind of law

LeBoeuf tips back in his chair and draws back his coat to
display a star A smug look

LeBoeuf
Thats right I am a Texas Ranger
Mattie

That may make you a big noise in that state in

Arkansas you

should mind that your Texas trappi
do not make

you an object of fun Why have you

LeBoeufs smile stays in place with effort

LeBoeuf

He shot and killed a state senator

Waco Texas The Bibbs family have

Mattie rolls away onto her side

wet your

Mattie
One would be as unpleasant as the other If you

comb it might tame that cowlick

Her eyelids droop
Spurs jingle and fade away

Distant voices from the street Clanging church bell Very
close the clink of bottle
against cup

Mattie looks blearily over The room is now filled with long
shadows

The landlady has materialized at the side of the bed She is
pouring something from a
bottle into a ceramic cup

Landlady
Try some Dr Underwoods You may feel giddy but
do not
be alarmed as that is only the medicine working

Mattie obediently rises to an elbow drinks then drops back
onto the pillow A clunk

The landlady has set the bottle down on the nightstand
Mattie squints at the bottle

Dr Underwoods Bile Activator
Approved by Physicians and Clergymen

The rooms shadows grow longer still and crawl up the bottle
The voice of the unseen landlady echoes and trails away
Landlady
I will charge you ten cents It probably means a
loss for me
but it is hard to figure the exact proportion of
the bottle
From outside the sound of a horse approaching at a gallop

We cut outside It is snowing and night again

Frank Rosss body is once again in the street before the
boarding house

The bareback horseman enters frame and recedes rifle tied to
his back

A saddled horse stands in the middle of the street pointed at
the receding Tom Chaney
Chaney disappears down the dark street into the falling snow

Small hands reach up and wrap the saddlehorn on the waiting
horse

Matties face appears over the saddle as she tries to pull
herself up

Close on her feet rising from the ground then pedaling seeking
purchase There are no

stirrups

Close on Mattie again Sweating she succeeds in chinning and
elbowing herself onto the

horses back The sound of the fleeing horseman has receded
almost to nothing

She gets herself arranged in the saddle She looks down for the
reins

The reins hang down from the bit
She lies forward onto the horses neck a fistful of mane in one
hand reaching with the
other reaching down her fingers curl around the reins
she pulls
The horse tosses its head and rears

Matties legs squeeze the horses flanks

Her fingers tighten on the horses mane but she is slipping
falling

In the boarding house bedroom Matties hands clutch at pillow

It is dark

A phlegm-hawking sound

A woman in a nightgown face obscured by sleeping bonnet
approaches the bed and

disappears around its far side

The sound of the old woman climbing into bed and settling

After a beat the covers are yanked from Mattie

After another beat--snoring
POST OFFICE

The door bangs open at the cut and Mattie emerges with an
envelope

It is day

STREET

Mattie walks down the street holding the ripped-open envelope in
one hand and some

unfolded papers in the other the topmost of which she reads as
she walks

We hear the letters contents in a gruff male voice-over

Letter

Mattie I wish you would leave these matters
entirely to me

or at the very least do me the courtesy of
consulting me

before entering such agreements I am not
scolding you but

I am saying your headstrong ways will lead you
into a tight

corner one day I trust the enclosed document
will let you

conclude your business and return to Dardanelle
Your

mother is in a panic and begging me to fetch you
back home

Yours J Noble Dagget

PAPERS
Thrust onto a desk

Wider shows that we are once again in the office of Stonehill
the stock trader He

examines the release through bleary eyes displaying none of his
former vinegar

Mattie
I was as bad yesterday as you look today I was
forced to
share a bed with Grandma Turner

The traders eyes are still on the paper
Stonehill

I am not acquainted with Grandma Turner If she
isa

resident of this city it does not surprise me
that she carries

disease I was told this malarial place was to be
the Chicago

of the Southwest Well my little friend it is
not the Chicago

of the Southwest I cannot rightly say what it
is but it has

ruined my health as it has my finances

He drops the paper

I owe you money

He works a key in a drawer and takes out money and counts during
the following

Mattie
You have not traded poorly

Stonehill
Certainly not I am paying you for a horse I do
not possess
and have bought back a string of useless ponies I
cannot sell
again

Mattie
You are forgetting the gray horse

Stonehill
Crowbait

Mattie
You are looking at the thing in the wrong light

Stonehill
I am looking at it in the light of Gods eternal
truth
He hands the money across and Mattie counts to confirm
Mattie
Your illness is putting you down in the dumps
You will

soon find a buyer for the ponies
from the

horseflesh

through

for one of

we
each for
for ten

refrain from doing

astute deal I

STABLE

Stonehill
I have a tentative offer of ten dollars per head

Pfitzer Soap Works of Little Rock
Mattie

It would be a shame to destroy such spirited

Stonehill
So it would I am confident the deal will fall

Mattie
Look here I need a pony I will pay ten dollars
them

Stonehill

No That was lot price No no Wait a minute Are
trading again I just handed you twenty dollars
those ponies and you now propose to buy one back
Little girl I will give you ten dollars to
any more business here It would be the most

have struck in Arkansas

We are tracking along a line of stalls toward a small corral
holding a black mustang
among other ponies

Mattie is approaching the horse A black stablehand has been
trailing her humping her
fathers saddle

Mattie
This one is beautiful

She rubs the muzzle of the black horse

She takes the saddle from the stablehand and tries to throw it
over the horse She is not tall
or strong enough
The stableboy helps then helps her up
The horse does not move for a long beat
The stableboy is laughing
Stableboy
He dont know theys a person up there You too

light

She kicks lightly and the horse abruptly pitches once or twice
and then starts prancing

The stableboy still laughing stands in the middle of a circle
defined by the prancing horse

Stableboy
He thinks he got a horsefly on him

Mattie leans forward to calm the horse rubbing the muzzle and
shushing him

She straightens

Mattie
He is very spirited I will call him Little
Blackie
Stableboy
Das a good name
Mattie

What does he like for a treat

Stableboy
Maam he is a horse so he likes apples

She reins the horse around and heads for the door calling back

Mattie
Thank Mr Stonehill for me

The receding stableboy is uncomfortable
Stableboy
No maam I aint sposed to utter your name
CANVAS FLAP

Whipped up at the cut
Peering in is Mattie holding the makeshift curtain open is an
elderly Chinese

Behind them we can see the shelves of a modest grocery store and
in the deep background
its bright street-facing window

Chinese
See Sleep

Reverse a squalid living area crowded with effects It is dim
There is snoring Rooster

Cogburn is in a Chinese rope bed his weight bowing it almost to
the ground

Mattie steps in

Mattie
That is fine I will wake him

Chinese
Wont like

Mattie ignores him poking at Rooster as the grocer withdraws
letting the canvas drop

behind him

Mattie
Mr Cogburn it is I Mattie Ross your employer

Rooster
Whuh

Mattie
How long til you are ready to go

Rooster opens his eyes blinks

Rooster
Go whar

Mattie
Into the Indian Territory In pursuit of Tom
Chaney

Rooster
Whah
He focuses on Mattie swings his legs out rumbles and spits on
the floor

Oh

He reaches over a pouch of tobacco and begins fumbling with
cigarette makings

Chaney You are the bereaved girl with
stories of El

Dorado Mr Lee Why are you admitting callers
A voice from the front of the store

Grocer
Toad her no good

Mattie takes out some cash

Mattie
I said fifty dollars to retrieve Chaney You did
not believe
me

Rooster is sobered by the sight of the currency

Rooster
Well I did not know You are a hard one to
figure

Mattie
How long for you to make ready to depart

Mattie takes the cigarette fixings at which Rooster is fumbling
and works on a cigarette

Rooster

Well now wait now sis I remember your offer
but do not

remember agreeing to it If Im going up
against Ned

Pepper I will need a hundred dollars I can
tell you that

much Hundred dollars I am not pursuing his
gang through

Arkansas where there is law and the criminal
is out of his

element They are in the Territory in their
element where

there is no law and the marshal stands alone
He spits again

Hundred dollars is the right amount I
will take those
fifty dollars in advance There will be
expenses

Mattie
You are trying to take advantage of me

Rooster

I am giving you the childrens rate I am not
a sharper I am

an old man sleeping in a rope bed in a room
behind a

Chinese grocery I should burn this damn
thing It is no

good for my back sister I have nothing

She hands him the finished cigarette

Mattie
You want to be kept in whiskey

Rooster is patting at his chest
Rooster
I dont have to buy that I confiscate it I
am an officer of the

court

She lights his cigarette

Thank you Hundred dollars That is the
rate
Mattie
I shall not niggle Can we depart this afternoon
Rooster
We
The word detonates a fit of coughing
You are not going That is no part of it
Mattie
You misjudge me if you think I am silly enough to
give you

fifty dollars and simply watch you ride off
thing done

warm beds

Rooster
I am a bonded US marshal

Mattie
That weighs but little with me I will see the
Rooster
You never said anything about this I cannot go up
Ned Pepper and a band of hard men and look after a
the same time

Mattie
I am not a baby

Rooster
I will not be stopping at boarding houses with

and plates of hot grub on the table It will be
and eating light What little sleeping is done
on the ground

Mattie
I have slept out at night Papa took me and Little

hunting last summer on the Petit Jean We were in
woods all night We sat around a big fire and
ghost stories We had a good time

Rooster
Coon hunting This aint no coon hunt it dont

forty miles of being a coon hunt

Mattie
It is the same idea as a coon hunt You are just

make your work sound harder than it is Here is
I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I

somebody who is game All I have heard out of you
talk I know you can drink whiskey and snore and

spit and

wallow in filth and bemoan your station The rest
has been

braggadocio They told me you had grit and that
is why I

came to you I am not paying for talk I can get
all the talk I
need and more at the Monarch Boarding House

Rooster stares nonplussed

He drops back into the rope bed which sets it swaying As he
stares up at the ceiling

Rooster
Leave the money Meet me here tomorrow morning at
seven
oclock and we will begin our coon hunt

GRANDMA TURNERS ROOM

Mattie makes early-morning preparations to leave as Grandma
Turner snores She unrolls

her fathers traps and takes out a big-brimmed fishermans hat
and puts it on too big She

lines it with newspaper experimenting with the amount until it
fits She puts on his coat

gives the sleeves a big cuff She examines the Colts dragoon
She drops apples into a

sack

She finishes by folding a letter she has written and putting it
into an envelope
Throughout we have been hearing its contents in voice-over

Mattie

Dearest Mother I am about to embark on a great
adventure
Or dare I call it a mission for shall any of us
rest easy ere
Papas death is avenged My investigations in
Fort Smith
lead me to believe that Tom Chaney can be found
and

brought to justice and I have made arrangements
to that end

will return to you once I have seen them
properly carried
through
EXTERIOR BOARDING HOUSE

Mattie is cinching her gear onto Little Blackie She mounts and
rides off as the letter ends

Mattie

But do not worry on my account Though I walk
through the

valley of the shadow of death I shall fear no
evil The

author of all things watches over me And I have
a fine

horse Kiss Little Frankie for me and pinch
Violets cheek

I am off for the Choctaw Nation

INTERIOR GROCERY

Tracking toward Roosters rope bed A hat is pulled down over
the face of the figure
reclining in it Smoke sifts up from somewhere

Mattie draws up to the figure with mounting concern She pulls
the hat off It is the
elderly Chinese grocer

Mattie
Where is Marshal Cogburn

The grocer reaches a pipe and pulls on it His manner is dreamy

Grocer
Went away

Mattie
Away Where

The grocer pulls an envelope from underneath his robe and hands
it to Mattie He closes
his eyes and drifts away

Mattie pulls a scrap of paper from the envelope and reads

Mattie
Here inside is a train ticket for your return
home Use it By
the time you read this I will be across the river
in the Indian
nation Pursuit would be futile I will return

with your man

Chaney Leave me to my work Reuben Cogburn

Matties jaw tightens She abruptly crumples the paper

RIVER

Mattie gallops down an embankment to a river of some width At

the near-side ferry

station a raft enclosed by railing waits
across the river A pilot

idles on the near shore

its guide rope strung

On the far shore two small figures mounted ascend the opposite

bank Mattie draws up in

front of the ferryman at the edge of the river

Mattie
Is that Marshal Cogburn
Ferryman
That is the man
Mattie
Whos he with
Ferryman
I do not know
Mattie
Take me across
He reaches for the reins of her horse
Ferryman
So youre the runaway Marshal told me youd show
up
Im to present you to the sheriff
Mattie

That is a story Let go my
across the
river

The ferryman is leading Little Blackie bac
the town Mattie cranes

around to look at the two small figures ac
have twisted in their saddles

horse I have business

k up the hill toward

ross the river They
to look back

Look Slim if you dont turn around and
take me across
you may find yourself in court where you dont
want to be I
have a good lawyer

Ferryman
Name aint Slim

She looks at the dull mans unresponsive back She twists to
look across the river

The two mounted figures are breaking their look back and
resuming their climb up the

bank

Mattie draws an apple from the bag slung round the saddlehorn
and pegs it hard as she
can at the ferryman

It hits him square in the back of the head He reacts reaching
to his head and dropping the
reins

Mattie has already leaned forward for the reins and sweeps them
back She saws Little
Blackie around and sends him galloping for the river

Mattie
Run Little Blackie

Ferryman
Hey

She urges the horse at the gallop into the river

The splashing and shouts have again drawn the attention of the
two men across the river

As the horse goes further into the river its up-and-down gait
slows the water offering
resistance

The ferryman has run down to the bank He stoops for a rock and
throws it It misses by a

mile

Little Blackie leaves riverbottom and starts swimming
The two men across the river having twisted to look now rein
their horses round to face

the action But they do not advance They rest forearms on
pommels and watch

Little Blackie is being carried downstream as he swims against a
swift current

Mattie
Good Little Blackie

Little Blackies head dips as he finds his feet again He slogs
laboriously to what is now

the nearer shore

The two men up the bank impassively watch

The horse and Mattie emerge fully from the river dripping

Mattie taps heels against Little Blackies flanks and walks him
slowly up the bank She

stops many yards short of the two men--Rooster and LeBoeuf

A silent standoff as Little Blackie breathes heavily The two
expressionless men still have
not stirred

At length

Rooster
Thats quite a horse

A long pause
I will give you ten dollars for him

Mattie
From the money you stole from me

Rooster
That was not stolen Im out for your man

Mattie
I was to accompany you If I do not there is no
agreement
and my money was stolen

Rooster licks his lips thinking
LeBoeuf
Marshal put this child back on the ferry We
have a long
road and time is a-wasting

Mattie
If I go back it is to the office of the US
marshals to report
the theft of my money And futile Marshal
Cogburn--
Pursuit would be futile--is not spelt f-u-d-
e-l

A heavy silence as Cogburn stares at her

LeBoeuf looks between the two waiting for Rooster to take
action Gathering that he will
not LeBoeuf slides off his horse

Mattie watches as he walks to Little Blackie holding up a
gentling hand for the horse to
sniff at and nuzzle

He abruptly swipes the reins with one hand and with the other
grabs Matties ankle He

pushes momentarily to unstirrup the foot and then pulls hard
tumbling Mattie to the

ground
LeBoeuf
Little sister it is time for your spanking
He begins to spank her
Mattie
Help me Marshal
Rooster sits impassively on his horse
LeBoeuf
(still spanking)
Now you do as the grown-ups say Or I will get
myself a

birch switch and stripe your leg
Mattie is struggling and in spite of herself starts to weep
LeBoeuf drags her through the
dirt to a mesquite bush and snaps off a switch

LeBoeuf
Now we will see what tune you sing

Mattie wet and filthy tries vainly to swat back Rooster still
watches without expression
as LeBoeuf whips the girl

Mattie
Are you going to let him do this Marshal

Finally quietly

Rooster
No I dont believe I will Put your switch away
LeBoeuf
She has got the best of us

LeBoeuf looks back for a moment too surprised to speak He then
regains his resolve

LeBoeuf
She has not got the best of me

He returns to the beating

Rooster
(evenly)
Did you not hear me That will do I said

LeBoeuf
I aim to finish what I started

Rooster
That will be the biggest mistake you ever made
you Texas
brush-popper

The sound of a gun being cocked

LeBoeuf leaves off the beating to stare at Rooster--whose gun is
drawn cocked and
pointed at him

LeBoeuf flings the switch aside and stalks to his horse He
mutters but loud enough to be
heard

LeBoeuf
Hoorawed by a little girl
CAMPFIRE

Mattie sits looking into the fire hands clasped around her
knees

LeBoeuf sits feet to the fire smoking a pipe that with his
boyish face makes him look as

if he is playing at professor He gazes into the fire musing as
he pulls at the pipe

LeBoeuf
I am not accustomed to so large a fire In Texas
we will
make do with a fire of little more than twigs or
buffalo chips
to heat the nights ration of beans

Rooster enters the circle of light with an armload of wood

And it is Ranger policy never to make your
camp in the
same place as your cookfire Very imprudent to
make your
presence known in unsettled country

Rooster gazes at LeBoeuf for a beat then dumps the wood onto
the fire

He leaves the circle of light

LeBoeuf addresses the darkness that Rooster has disappeared
into

How do you know that Bagby will have
intelligence

Rooster
He has a store

He reenters with a length of rope and a robe which he unrolls
onto the ground

LeBoeuf
A store That makes him an authority on movements
in the
Territory

Rooster plays out one end of the rope to just touch the ground
then starts playing out the
rest as he paces
Rooster
We have entered a wild place Anyone coming in
wanting
any kind of supply cannot pick and choose his
portal

He has finished making a loop around his sleeping robe Seeing
this LeBoeuf laughs

LeBoeuf
That is a piece of foolishness All the snakes
are asleep this
time of year

As he leaves the circle of light

Rooster
They have been known to wake up

Mattie
Let me have a rope too

Rooster
A snake would not bother you

He reenters with a bottle and settles down on his robe
You are too little and bony Before you

sleep you should
fetch water for the morning and put it by the

fire The
creek1ll ice over tonight
Mattie
I am not going down there again If you want any
more
water you can fetch it yourself

Rooster
Everyone in my party must do his job

LeBoeuf

You are lucky to be traveling in a place where a
spring is so

handy In my country you can ride for days and
see no

ground water I have lapped filthy water from a
hoofprint

and was glad to have it
he never

shake his hand

it Maybe it is

Ranger policy

Cogburn

wont hear

you

Rooster
If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies that says

drank water from a horse track I think I will
and give him a Daniel Webster cigar

LeBoeuf
You dont believe it

Rooster
I believed it the first twenty-five times I heard

true Maybe lapping water off the ground is
LeBoeuf
You are getting ready to show your ignorance now
I dont mind a little personal chaffing but I
anything against the Ranger troop from a man like
Rooster

How long have you boys been mounted on sheep down
there

LeBoeuf leaps angrily to his feet

American

another

show for this

tongue

girls eyes

Silence

LeBoeuf
My shaggy horse will be galloping when that big

stud of yours is winded and collapsed Now make

joke about it You are only trying to put on a

girl Mattie with what you must think is a keen
Rooster

This is like women talking

LeBoeuf
Yes that is the way Make me out foolish in this

Rooster
I think she has got you pretty well figured

Crackling fire
Mattie

Would you two like to hear the story of The
Midnight

Caller One of you will have to be The
Caller I will tell

you what to say I will do all the other parts
myself

LeBoeuf continues to glare at Rooster breathing heavily

Rooster with a loud flap whips the robe over himself

DAWN

We are close on Matties upturned face Snowflakes are drifting
down onto it and

melting Matties eyes blink open

Rooster is already at his horse packing it LeBoeuf is not in
evidence

Mattie rises

Mattie
Good morning Marshal
Rooster
(eyes on his work)
Morning
Mattie
Where is Mr LeBoeuf
A toss of his head
Rooster

Down the hill Performing his necessaries

Mattie
Marshal Cogburn I welcome the chance for a
private parley

I gather that you and Mr LeBoeuf have come to
some sort of

agreement As your employer I believe I have a
right to

know the particulars

Rooster
The particulars is that we bring Chaney in to the
magistrate

in San Saba Texas where they have a considerable
reward on

offer Which we split

Mattie
I did not want him brought to Texas to have
Texas
punishment administered for a Texas crime That
was not
our agreement
Rooster gives a vicious tug on the cinchrope
Rooster
What you want is to have him caught and punished
Mattie
I want him to know he is being punished for
killing my
father
Rooster turns to her
Rooster
You can let him know that You can tell him to
his face
You can spit on him and make him eat sand out of
the road

I will hold him down If you want I will flay the
flesh off the

soles of his feet and find you an Indian pepper
to rub into the

wound Isnt that a hundred dollars value

Mattie
It is not When I have bought and paid for
something I will
have my way Why do you think I am paying you if
not to
have my way

Rooster
It is time for you to learn you cannot have your
way in every
little particular Other people have their
interests

We hear spurs jingling
I ama free agent If you find I fail to

satisfy your terms I

expedition

marshals

will return your money at the end of this

Mattie
Little Blackie and I are riding back to the US

office This is fraud

LeBoeuf has appeared

are still

Marshal

He rode

Bill

Rooster
God damn it
LeBoeuf
Whats going on
Rooster
(testy)

This is a business conversation

LeBoeuf
Is that what you call it It sounds to me like you

being hoorawed by a little girl

Rooster
Did you say hooraw
LeBoeuf
That was the word
Rooster
I will show you hooraw
Mattie

There is no hoorawing in it My agreement with the
antedates yours It has the force of law

LeBoeuf

(amused)
The force of law This man is a notorious thumper
by the light of the moon with Quantrill and Bloody

Anderson

Rooster
Those men was patriots Texas trash

LeBoeuf

They murdered women and children in Lawrence

Kansas
Rooster

I have heard that too It is a damned lie What
army was

you in mister

LeBoeuf
I was at Shreveport first with Kirby-Smith--

Rooster
What side was you on

LeBoeuf
I was in the army of Northern Virginia Cogburn
and I dont
have to hang my head when I say it

Rooster
If you had served with Captain Quantrill--

LeBoeuf
Captain Quantrill indeed

Rooster
You had best let this go LeBoeuf

LeBoeuf
Captain of what

Rooster

Good then There are not sufficient dollars in
the state of

Texas to make it worth my while to listen to your
opinions

day and night Our agreement is nullified--its
each man for

himself

LeBoeuf is already mounting his shaggy horse

LeBoeuf
That suits me

He saws the horse around
Congratulations Cogburn You have
graduated from
marauder to wetnurse Adios

LeBoeuf gallops off with the thunder of hoofs and the jingle of
spurs and Rooster

seething turns back to his work

As the hoofbeats recede Mattie sounds a note of regret

Mattie
We dont need him do we Marshal
Rooster
(muttering)
Well miss his Sharps carbine Its apt to get
lively out

here

EXTERIOR BAGBYS STORE

A mule is pulling back on a cotton rope round his neck that is
tied off to the porch of the

ramshackle store The beast is strangling as the rope is too
tight and he is being poked

with sticks by two motley-dressed Indian boys up on the porch

Rooster enters and cuts the rope The mule brays and canters
off shaking its head rope
dangling

Indian Youth
Hey

Rooster is already mounting the steps to the porch

Rooster
Call that sport do ya

He kicks the first youth hard in the ass sending him sprawling
off the porch into the dirt

The second backs against the railing and Rooster shoves him in
the chest so that he flips

backward to also land in the dirt

Rooster
Stay here sister I will see Bagby

Mattie astride Little Blackie holds the reins of Cogburns
horse As he disappears inside
the two youths climb back onto the porch They sit at the lip
feet dangling and stare
sullenly at Mattie She stares back

MINUTES LATER

The youths have not moved The door bangs open and Rooster
emerges

Mattie
Has Chaney been here

Rooster
No

Crossing back he kicks one of the boys off the porch into the
dirt again The other youth
scampers out of footreach Rooster starts down the stairs

Rooster
But Coke Hayes was two days ago Coke runs with
Lucky
Ned He bought supplies with this

With a ching he flips a coin to Mattie She inspects it gold
square with a -shaped cut-
out in the middle

Mattie

Rooster
Potter and I served with him at Elkhorn Tavern

latterly our activities was by and large martial
though one time run across a Yankee paymaster
him of four thousand dollars in gold coin

was his own money Well since hostilities was
ended it was technically criminal so Potter rode
Arkansas and I went to Cairo Illinois with my
calling myself Burroughs and opened an eating

The Green Frog I married a grass widow but my
picked up and my wife did not like the company of
friends She decided to go back to her first

in a hardware store She said Goodbye Reuben
decency does not abide in you I told her

I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make
this time She took my boy with her too He

me anyhow I guess I did speak awful rough to him
not mean nothing by it You would not want to see

clumsier child than Horace I bet he broke forty

He frowns and draws up looking at something Mattie follows his

look

A man is hanging in a tree--very high perhaps thirty feet off
the ground The body slowly
twists The head seems unnaturally large

Rooster
Hey

At Roosters shout something separates from the head we have
been looking at not just the

corpses silhouette but that of a large carrion-eating bird as
well perched on the corpses

shoulder and feeding at the corpses face The bird flaps
clumsily off

Rooster gazes at the strung-up body

Rooster
Is it Chaney

Mattie
I would not recognize the soles of his feet

Rooster gets off his horse pulls a knife from his gear and
ambles to the tree Mattie
follows

When she arrives Rooster has started sawing at the rope that
ties the body off wrapped
around a chest-high branch stump Mattie looks up

She is looking mostly at soles of feet as the foreshortened body
twists slowly high above

Rooster
Step back now

She does Rooster steps back as well as the almost-cut-through
rope starts to unravel by

itself crazily twisting under the pressure and gently spinning
the body above

The rope snaps It yanks violently upward slapping branches

The body drops--perhaps four feet--and jerks to a stop
jacknifing and dancing

Rooster
God damn it

They both gaze up at the body
Rooster
Snagged Well you are going to have to clamber on
up with
this knife I am too old and too fat

UP IN THE TREE
Mattie is well up

We hear Roosters voice from below

Rooster
t had one billiard table served ladies and men
both but
mostly men I tried to run it myself a while but
I couldnt

keep good help and I never did learn how to buy
meat I was
like a man fighting bees Finally I give up and
solt it and
went out to see the country

Mattie pauses looking down

We are over her Rooster is foreshortened a long way down
looking up smoking a
cigarette He reacts to her look down

Rooster
You are doing well

She looks up down again and then proceeds Rooster continues
as well

That was when I went out to the staked
plains of Texas
and shot buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe anda
Flathead Indian
called Olly

Mattie stretches onto tiptoes reaches just gets fingers around
a branch She secures it

enough with the one hand to dare to reach with the other She
hauls herself up

The Mormons had run Shaftoe out of Great

Salt Lake

City but dont ask me what it was for Call ita
misunder-

standing and let it go at that There is no use
in you asking

me questions about it for I will not answer
them
Mattie looks out at waist-height to the corpse which twists
maybe eight feet away over
the void Rooster notes her look
Is it our man

The face is half-eaten and eyeless

Mattie
I believe not

She moves to start back down but Rooster calls

Rooster
No Cut him down

Mattie
Why

Rooster

I might know him

She climbs one more branch to arrive at the hanging branch She
shimmies out onto it and
pulls the knife from Roosters belt now around her waist

You see Olly and me both taken a solemn
oath to keep
silent Well sir the big shaggies is about all
gone It isa
damned shame

Mattie looks down over the shoulder of the close-by
foreshortened corpse to the far
foreshortened Rooster

I would give three dollars right now for a
pickled buffalo
tongue

She calls out as she starts sawing

Mattie
Why did they hang him so high

Rooster
I dont know Possibly in the belief it would
make him more
dead

The sawing continues
Rooster takes one step back
The rope snaps At once
The body drops
The branch unburdened bucks with Mattie atop it

She gasps hugging at the branch getting swung halfway around
it but then righting

herself

The body hits the ground with a smack

Mattie looks

The body is spread out on the ground below many bones now
broken its posture absurd

Rooster steps forward He toes the upper body to get a view of
the face Barely audible

Rooster
I do not know this man

He reacts to something looking up the road in the direction of
their heading

Mattie looks out Partly obscured by intervening foliage an
oncoming rider His pace is
unhurried

Down on the ground Rooster turns to face the rider--an Indian
with a long-bore rifle

balanced sideways across the pommel of his saddle He wears a
tattered Union Army

jacket crossed bandoliers of rifle shells and a black homburg
hat with a feather in its brim

Rooster drops his hand to his gun as the rider approaches

Mattie looks down at the foreshortened rider pulling up under
the tree She hears a
greeting and a mostly inaudible exchange

After some back-and-forth the Indian dismounts The men stoop at
either end of the
corpse Rooster grabs wrists the Indian ankles They lift
Mattie frowns She starts to move

A MINUTE LATER

Mattie finishes climbing down

Rooster is just returning from the road to their two horses by
the tree The Indian with the

corpse slung over the rump of his horse is resuming his trip in
the direction from which

Rooster and Mattie came

Mattie
He knew the hanged man

Rooster mounts
Rooster
He did not But it is a dead body possibly worth
something

in trade

He looks up at the sky as snowflakes start to sift down

RIDING

It is snowing lightly Rooster and Mattie are clomping through a
stream

Rooster
She had taken a notion she wanted me to be a
lawyer
Bought a heavy book called Daniels on Negotiable
Instruments and set me to reading it Never could
get a grip

on it and I was happy enough to set it aside and
leave Texas

There aint but about six trees between there and
Canada

and nothing else grows but has stickers on it I
went to--

A distant gunshot
Rooster stops He twists to look behind

A listening beat At length
Rooster
I knew it

Mattie
Knew what

Rooster
Were being followed I asked the Indian to
signal with a
shot if there was someone on our trail

Mattie
Should we be concerned Marshal

Rooster
No Its Mr LeBoeuf using us as bird dogs in
hopes of
cutting in once weve flushed the prey Our Texas
friend has
got just enough sense to recognize he cant
outtrack me

Mattie thinks
Mattie
Perhaps we could double back over our tracks
and confuse
the trail in a clever way
Rooster
No we will wait right here and offer our
friend a warm
hello and ask him where he is going
MINUTES LATER
Rooster waits sitting casually astride his horse in the middle
of the road Snow continues
to fall

A jingling noise up the road

Movement an advancing rider seen through the foliage that masks
a bend in the road

Rooster straightens

The oncoming rider rounds the bend
He

approaches a white man with big whiskers his horse leading

a packhorse loaded with

clinking and jangling sundries Draped on his own

is the hanged mans
body

The stranger wears a fierce bear head as hat The rest of the

bearskin
as

He

trails down his body

advances unhurriedly towards Rooster At a few yards

he draws up content
sit his horse and solemnly return Roosters stare

length

Rooster
You are not LeBoeuf

Bear Man

My name is Forster I practice dentistry in the

Nation Also

veterinary arts And medicine on those humans

that will sit

bottle of

Rooster straightens as if to rein his horse around but stops

still for it

Rooster
(indicating corpse)

You have your work cut out for you there

Bear Man

Traded for him with an Indian who said he came
honestly I gave up two dental mirrors anda

expectorant (beat) Do either of you need medical

attention

Rooster
No

with a thought

It is fixing to get cold Do you know of

any place to take

Original

shelter

Bear Man

I have my bearskin You might want to head to the

horses rump
Greaser Bobs He notched a dugout into a hollow
along the

Carrillon River If you ride the river you wont
fail to see it

Greaser Bob--Original Greaser Bob--is hunting
north of the

picket wire and would not begrudge its use

A pause
The Bear Man tilts his head to indicate the corpse behind him

Bear Man
I have taken his teeth I will entertain an offer
for the rest of
him

NIGHT

A point-of-view looking down on a thrown-together cabin dug into
the flanks of a ravine

Its roof meets hillside at the rear Smoke is coming out of a
rough chimney

Rooster and Mattie have paused at the crest of the rise above
the dugout to look Rooster
shrugs out of his coat

Rooster
Take my jacket Creep onto the roof If they are
not friendly
I will give you a sign to damp the chimney

As Mattie descends to where hillside meets structure Rooster
takes his rifle and walks

around to the front door--crude planking hung on leather-strap
hinges His footsteps

crunch in the snow

The door is yanked open inches and a backlit face appears over
a hand holding a revolver
Rooster halts

Man
Who is out there

Rooster
We are looking for shelter
Man
No room for you here Ride on

The door slams

After a moment the light inside goes out

Mattie arriving on the roof looks steeply down on Rooster He
glances up thinking He

does not sign He looks back at the door

Rooster
Who all is in there

Voice
Ride on

Rooster looks up at Mattie He nods

She balls the jacket and stuffs it into the chimney

Rooster takes ten paces to one side of the door and then kneels
in the snow raising his

rifle

Long beat

Muffled coughs from inside the house--more than one person

Activity inside--yelling--the hiss of fire being doused
Suddenly

The door flies open and--BANG BANG--two shotgun blasts

Slightest beat as Mattie peers into the yard and then--BANG--
shot rips through the

roof just at her feet

A rifle blast--from Rooster A yelp of pain from inside

Rooster
I am a Federal officer Who is in there Speak

up and be

quick about it

New Voice
A Methodist and a son-of-a-bitch

Rooster cocks his head

Rooster
Is that Emmett Quincy

New Voice
I dont know any Emmett Quincy

Rooster

Quincy

Rooster
Drag him out Light that lamp

Thinking beat

Quincy
Tell them other officers to be careful with
their guns We

The door opens again From the smoky black a shotgun and two
revolvers are tossed out

Then orange light a lamp is lit Two men emerge one limping
and holding onto the

other who holds high the lamp
Rooster
Down in the snow Lie still while I cuff you
We is only
two but my man on the roof will shoot you if
you get feisty

INSIDE

Rooster has coaxed the fire back to life He peers into the
large pot hanging over it

The cuffed men sit side-by-side on a plank bench behind a plank
table staring at Mattie
Moons leg is bound with a large blue handkerchief

Quincy sounds resentful

Quincy
You said it was a man on the roof I thought it
was Potter

Rooster
You was always dumb Quincy and remain true to
form

He stirs the pot with a wooden spoon
-This heres an awful lot of sofky Was you
boys looking
for company
Quincy
That is our supper and breakfast both I like a
big breakfast

Moon nods agreement but has a different thought

Moon
Sofky always cooks up bigger than you think

Rooster continuing to nose around pushes the canvas cover off
a crate of bottles

Rooster
And a good store of whiskey as well What are you
boys up
to outside of cooking banquets You are way too
jumpy

Quincy

Quincy

starts eating

Ned He is

There is a new boy that might be running with

Rooster

Rooster shrugs at Moon

Quincy

Moon
I would say if I knew

Quincy
We are weary trappers
He reacts to Mattie staring at him
Who worked you over with the ugly stick
Matties look shifts to Moon
Mattie
The man Chaney with the marked face killed my
father He

was a whiskey drinker like you and it led to
killing in the

end If you answer the marshals questions he
will help you

I have a good lawyer at home and he will help you

Moon

Quincy

Mattie
(to Quincy)
I dont like you I hope you go to jail My
lawyer will not

Moon
My leg is giving me fits
Rooster
Yes a young fellow like you dont want to loose
his leg
You are too young to be getting about on a willow
peg You

Quincy
Easy now He is trying to get at you

Rooster
I am getting at you with the truth

Moon
We seen Ned and Haze two days ago Wes supposed-

Quincy
Dont act the fool If you blow I will kill you
Moon
I am played out I must have a doctor Wes
supposed--

Quincy jerks up one knee banging the bottom of the table and
sloshing Roosters sofky as

he grabs something from his boot a knife

He slams it down on Moons cuffed hand chopping off four
fingers They fly like chips

from a log

As Moon screams Rooster mutters

Rooster
God damn it

Quincy flips the knife lightly in the air and regrabs it with
blade pointing opposite-wise

He twists and rears with cuffed hands to plunge the knife into
Moons chest

Rooster has his gun out now and fires

Quincy jerks back hit in the face Blood spatters Mattie
Quincy still seated slides

awkwardly down the wall

Moon has fallen to the floor knife in chest

Moon
Oh lord I am dying

Rooster and Mattie stand over him
Do something Help me

Rooster

I am bleeding buckets I am gone Send the
brother George Garrett He is a Methodist
South Texas You can write care of the district
Austin

Rooster
Should I tell him you was outlawed up

Moon
It dont matter he knows I am on the scout I

later walking the streets of Glory

Rooster
Dont be looking for Quincy

Matties point-of-view the dark shoulders of the wooded hills

funneling down to the

ravine It is all very still except for falling snow
Mattie stands outside the cabin door hugging herself keeping
watch

The door opens and Rooster emerges

Rooster
Hobble our mounts in the corral out back We
dont know
when theys coming

From the threshold he surveys the inside of the cabin

Mattie
Is he dead

Rooster
He is I stowed the bodies under the blanket
there Just
needs to look right enough to get em in the
door

Something he sees inside prompts Rooster to quickly reenter the
cabin He reemerges fist
closed on something

Well climb that ridge there fort up
somewhere gives us
a clear shot

He flings and whatever he was holding lands faintly pit-a-pat
in the woods

Mattie
What was that

Rooster
Fingers

RIDGE
Rooster finishes hunkering down

He takes out his revolver and put a cartridge into the one empty
chamber under the

hammer He places the revolver on a log and puts the sack of
cartridges next to the

revolver He leans his rifle against the log He looks out
His point-of-view of the cabin below peaceful smoke drifting

from the chimney

Mattie
What do we do now

Rooster takes out a sack of corn dodgers and starts to eat

them all in

then we will

serious Then I
alive If they
hopeful that

starch out of

Chewing beat

New Mexico

around and
them boys firing
guess they

Rooster
We wait They ride up what we want is to get

the dugout I will kill the last one to go in and
have them in a barrel

Mattie
You will shoot him in the back

Rooster
It will give them to know our intentions is

will call down and see if they will be taken
wont I will shoot them as they come out I am
three of their party being dead will take the

them

Mattie
You display great poise

Rooster
It is just a turkey shoot There was one time in

when Bo was a strong colt and I myself had less
was being pursued by seven men I turned Bo
taken the reins in my teeth and rode right at
them two navy sixes I carry on my saddle Well I
was all married men who loved their families as
scattered and run for home

Mattie
That is hard to believe

Rooster
What is
Mattie
One man riding at seven
Rooster
It is true enough You go for a man hard enough
and fast
enough and he dont have time to think about how
many is

with him--he thinks about himself and how he may
get clear
of the wrath that is about to set down on him

Mattie
Why were they pursuing you

Rooster
They was in the nature of a posse

Mattie
You were particeps criminis in something other
than the case
of the Yankee paymaster

Rooster
I robbed a high-interest bank You cant roba
thief can
you I never robbed a citizen Never took a
mans watch

Mattie
It is all stealing
Rooster
That is the position they took in New Mexico
He is suddenly alert and raises a hand for quiet
There is the sound of a rider approaching slowly
Rooster is puzzled
One man I didnt figure them to send a
scout

Their high point-of-view a mounted figure has entered the
ravine
He travels its length and stops his horse before the cabin and
dismounts We hear the
jingle of spurs
Damn It is LeBoeuf

Distant calling toward the cabin

LeBoeuf
Hello

LeBoeuf unholsters a gun He walks to the cabin opens the door
and peers in

Rooster starts to rise about to call out as LeBoeuf enters and
closes the door

We hear hoofbeats Many horses

Mattie
We have to warn him Marshal

Rooster is looking to the mouth of the ravine

Rooster
Too late

Mattie follows his look
Their high point-of-view four riders just entering the ravine
They look back to the cabin

From inside faintly

LeBoeuf
Oh

The door opens and LeBoeuf stumbles out wide-eyed
He sees the approaching riders They see him
They slow approaching with caution

LeBoeuf looks at them glances back over his shoulder looks
forward again

Mattie
What do we do Marshal
Rooster
We sit What does he do

The riders stop several paces from LeBoeuf They spread ina
line facing him Words are
exchanged we cannot make them out

LeBoeuf unholsters a gun and points it at the four men

Rooster
He is a fine one for not drawing attention to
himself

The four men slouched astride their horses are not impressed
by LeBoeufs gun There is
more talking

Rooster
Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned

He refers to the mounted man who does most of the talking Lucky
Ned now speaks to the

men on either side and the two corners advance closing a circle
around LeBoeuf

LeBoeuf looks warily from side side swinging his gun to cover
the group None of the
riders bothers to unholster a gun

The man to LeBoeufs right lifts a rope off his saddle and
casually twirls it

The man to his left says something LeBoeuf looks left and the
man to his right drops the

rope around LeBoeuf and pulls it tight LeBoeuf is jerked off
his feet gun dropping The

mounted man backs his horse taking the play from the rope He
dallies the free end round

his saddlehorn

Two of the men slide off their horses
One of them heads for the cabin door

Rooster
Well thats that

BANG--the rifleshot just at Matties ear is deafening
looks

below

reins

The man heading to the cabin drops shot in the back

The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill panicked
The horse towing LeBoeuf also skitters spooked as its rider
wildly about and starts

shooting

Lucky Ned looks toward our vantage point and also begins firing
Rooster is methodically aiming and firing but in the commotion

his first couple of
shots dont tell His third drops Lucky Neds horse

The other unmounted man is frantically trying to snatch up the
of one of the loose
horses

The man towing LeBoeuf spurs his horse toward one of the free

horses trying to grab it

basin

LeBoeuf is dragged past plunging horses hooves

A cacaphony of screaming horses crackling gunfire from the
and the boom of

Roosters rifle

The unmounted man has managed to grab a halter He climbs with

difficulty aboard the

skittish horse

The rider towing LeBoeuf cuts loose the towline He gallops

toward Ned Pepper with an

arm outstretched to help him aboard
Rooster is tracking him with his rifle

Lucky Ned grabs the extended arm As he begins to swing up there

is the BOOM of

Roosters rifle The rider pitches off the horse but Lucky Ned

manages to stay on and

swipes up the reins He gallops off

The one other surviving horseman follows him

There is one dead horse in the basin a live unmounted horse

racing crazy circles and three

still bodies One is LeBoeufs

Rooster rises
Rooster
Well that didnt pan out
IN THE BASIN
LeBoeuf is moaning

Rooster walks toward him trailed by Mattie glancing along the
way at the two dead men

Rooster
You managed to put a kink in my rope pardner

LeBoeuf
I am theverely injured

Something is wrong with LeBoeufs speech Bloody saliva bubbles
copiously from his

mouth
Rooster
Yes you got drug some
LeBoeuf
Altho shshot By a rifle
Rooster stoops to examine
Rooster

That is quite possible The scheme did not
develop as I had

planned You have been shot in the shoulder but
the ball

passed through It will pain you in the years
to come What

happened to your mouth

LeBoeuf
I believe I beh mythelf

Rooster slaps lightly down at LeBoeufs chin signaling that he
should open up

LeBoeuf does and Rooster digs in with two dirty fingers
dipping his head to peer in as he

pokes this way and that

Rooster
almost
should I just
off being

make

Bloody saliva

wound The

Couple of teeth missing and yes the tongue is bit
through Do you want to see if it will knit or
yank it free I know a teamster who bit his tongue
thrown from a horse After a time he learned to
himself more or less understood

LeBoeuf
Hngnickh

bubbles out with the word Rooster withdraws his

Rooster
Whats that now

LeBoeuf
Knit

Rooster

Very well It is impossible to bind a tongue

shoulder we will kit out

Mattie goes to inspect the two outlaws corpses as Rooster pokes
back LeBoeufs shirt to
look at the wound

sorts but I do

Hayes
his
Mountains

is waiting

Its too bad We just ran across a doctor of
not know where he was headed

LeBoeuf
I thaw him too Ith how I came to be here

Mattie
Neither of these men are Chaney Marshal

Rooster
I know it I know them both The ugly one is Coke

Him uglier still is Clement Parmalee Parmalee and
brothers have a silver claim in the Winding Stair
and I will bet you thats where Lucky Neds gang

Well sleep here follow in the morning
Mattie
We promised to bury the poor soul inside

Rooster
Ground is too hard If these men wanted a decent

burial they
should have got themselves kilt in summer

SNOW

Falling straight down a windless night

We hear a murmuring male voice from inside the cabin
Mattie is finishing rubbing down her horse

Mattie
Sleep well Little Blackie

She puts up the brush and pulls an apple from her apple bag

I have a notion that tomorrow we will reach

our object
We are hot on the trail

The horse chomps up the apple and she rubs its muzzle as it
chews

It seems that we will overtake Tom Chaney

in the
Winding Stair Mountains I would not want to be

in his
shoes

The horse huffs and blows

FRONT OF THE CABIN

We are raking the four dead men who have been carelessly propped
against the outside

wall to sit in an irregular row Mattie passes them with a
brief look and opens the door

and the murmuring voice from inside fans up louder

INSIDE
As Mattie enters We see LeBoeuf musing before the fire as he
cleans his Sharps carbine

--an awkward operation given the injury to his shoulder now
bandaged

All we see of Rooster seated further from the fire is a pair
of boots and legs stretching
into darkness

Mattie goes to the pot of food on the fire
LeBoeuf

Azh I understand it Chaney--or Chelmzhford azh
he called

himshelf in Texas--shot the shenatorzh dog When
the

shenator remonshtrated Chelmzhford shot him azh
well

You could argue that the shooting of the dog wazh
merely an

inshtansh of malum prohibitum but the shooting
ofa

shenator izh indubitably an inshtansh of malum in
shay

Rooster is a voice in the darkness

Rooster
Malla-men what

Mattie
Malum in se The distinction is between an act
that is wrong
in itself and an act that is wrong only
according to our laws
and mores It is Latin

We hear the pthoonk of a bottle yielding its cork followed by
the pthwa of the corks
being spit out

Rooster
I am struck that LeBoeuf is shot trampled and
nearly severs
his tongue and not only does not cease to talk
but spills the
banks of English

We hear liquid slosh as the bottle is tipped back
once

LeBoeuf
(placidly)
I wuzh within three hundred yardzh of Chelmzhford

The closhesht I have been With the Sharpsh

carbine that

izh within range But I wuzh mounted and had the

choish of

firing off-hand or dishmounting to shoot from

resht--which

would allow Chelmzhford to augment the dishtansh

I fired

mounted--and fired wide

We hear the smack of lips releasing bottleneck and a wet

breath

yards

Rooster
You could not hit a man at three hundred
if the gun
was resting on Gibraltar

LeBoeuf
The Sharpsh carbine izh an inshtrument of

uncanny power

front

and precizhun

Rooster
I have no doubt that the gun is sound

Silence

LeBoeuf shrugs

MORNING

Wide three riders leave the cabin single-file

Jump in pushing Mattie who rides last in line LeBoeuf is in
of her Rooster leads

head tipping momentarily back to swig from a bottle

He then half-hums half-scats a tune

Mattie twists to look behind

Her point-of-view pulling away from the cabin against the wall

of which the four dead
men are now semi-drifted over with snow Roosters humming has
stopped and we hear
his voice

Rooster

That was Johnny in the Low Ground There are
very few

fiddle tunes I have not heard Once heard they
are locked in

my mind forever It is a sadness to me that I
have sausage

fingers that cannot crowd onto a fretboard--
little fat girls at

a cotillion Soldiers Joy

He launches into another song interrupted by the slosh of
liquid as he takes a drink

Mattie looks forward again and LeBoeuf turns to look back at
her He keeps his voice low

LeBoeuf
I dont believe he shlept

Still without looking back Rooster projects

Rooster
Fort Smith is a healthy distance LeBoeuf but I
would

encourage the creature you ride to try to make it
in a day Out here a

one-armed man looks like easy prey

LeBoeuf
And a one-eyed man--who cant shshoodt Why dont
you
tshurn back Khoghburn

Rooster
I will do fine

He twists around to gaily hector LeBoeuf

I know where the Parmalees claim is I am
uninjured I
am provisioned--and we agreed to separate

LeBoeuf
In conscschiensh you cannot shite our agreement
You are
the pershon who shshot me
Mattie
Mr LeBoeuf has a point Marshal It is an unfair

leg-up in
any competition to shoot your opposite number
Rooster
God damn it I dont accept it as a given that I
did shoot

LeBoeuf There was plenty of guns going off

LeBoeuf
I heard a rifle and felt the ball You mishshed
your shshodt
Khoghburn admit it You are more handicapped
without the
eye than I without the arm

Rooster
Missed my shot I can hit a gnats eye at ninety
yards
He reins his horse up hastily tips the bottle to his mouth to
make sure it is empty and then
hurls it high
He pulls out a navy six-gun and fires

The bottle reaches the height of its arc untouched and drops

Rooster cocks his head at the landed bottle several paces
distant He shoots again and

misses

He shoots a third time and the bottle shatters
Rooster
The chinaman is running them cheap shells on me
again
LeBoeuf
I tdhought you were going to shay the shun was in
your

eyezh That izh to shay your eye

Rooster starts to dismount finishing in a semi-controlled fall
He dusts one knee and

reaches into his saddlebag He pulls out a corn dodger and
heaves it up

He fires The corn dodger is obliterated
He reaches two corn dodgers from the saddlebag

Rooster
Two at one time

He hurls them and quickly fires twice Nothing happens he
quickly fires three times at the
falling corn dodgers missing

Scowling he throws a single corn dodger and is just raising his
gun when another gun goes
off making him jump

LeBoeuf has fired with a gun in his left hand missing

Rooster
I will chunk one high Hold fire

He reaches into the saddlebag and hurls it high Both he and
Leboeuf fire It explodes

LeBoeuf
There

Rooster
There My bullet

LeBoeuf

Your bullet If you hit what you aim at
eckshplain my
shoulder

Mattie
Gentlemen shooting cornbread out here on the
prairie is
getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang

Rooster
One more this will prove it Hold fire

He tosses a corn dodger and fires It holds to its are and
falls LeBoeuf is smug

LeBoeuf
Azh I shed Khoghburn

Rooster roars

Rooster
Did you not see the piece fly off

RIDING

Some time later

Rooster sways in the saddle holding a bottle humming

He tips his head up and tilts the bottle all the way back
confirming that this one too is now

empty

Riding forward he leans out of the saddle stretching low to
one side his hand extended

with the bottle Wavering he places it upon a large rock as he
passes

His arm waves for balance as he straightens but he keeps his
place on the horse He half-

turns propping himself with one hand on his saddle-back to
address Mattie and LeBoeuf

Rooster
Find our way back
SKY

Framed by a mine entrance

Rooster steps into the square wood-beam frame of the entrance
looking in

A beat and he pulls out his six-gun and fires in
Echoing ricochets

Wide outside Rooster before the entrance Mattie and LeBoeuf
standing close by Very

still

The little camp is deserted
Rooster turns to pan the hills
At length

Rooster
Lucky Ned
Very faint echo
Faintly from our distant perspective

LeBoeuf
Very good Khoghburn Now what

CRACKLING CAMPFIRE
It is raining

The campfire is roughly canopied by a hide draped at a cant over
a pair of tree branches

Mattie pours hot water from a kettle into a large tin cup
holding a corn dodger She takes a
fork and starts mashing the dodger into mush

LeBoeuf sits before the fire coat over his head one hand on
his jaw which is swollen

LeBoeuf
Cogburn does not want me eating out of his
store

Mattie
That is silly You have not eaten the whole
day and it is my
store not his

Rooster
Let him starve

Rooster bellicose stumbles to the fire with a few thin
branches As he leans in toward the

fire the water draining off the low edge of the canopy drums
onto his neck He waves a

hand back at it like a man swatting flies

Rooster
He does not track He does not shoot--except at
foodstuffs--
LeBoeuf
That wazh your idea
Rooster

--He does not contribute He is a millstone with
opinions
He is a man who walks in front of bullets

Rooster sits heavily a stretching leg kicking away an empty
bottle Rain patters on his hat

like a band of

swollen and

rise to his

anther the

He is a drag-brake for horses
Mattie
Mr LeBoeuf drew single-handed upon the Lucky Ned
Pepper Gang while we fired safely from cover

sly Injuns

Rooster
We

Mattie
It is unfair to indict a man when his jaw is

tongue mangled and who is therefore unable to
own defense

LeBoeuf
I can thpeak for mythelf I am hardly obliged to

He rises and starts gathering his things

Gentlemen we cannot fall out in this fashion so

between here and Fort Smith he is gone Long
Thanks to Mr LeBoeuf we missed our shot We
barked and the birds have flown Gone gone gone
Ned and his cohort gone Your fifty dollars

take him in and honor his gibberings by making
You sister may go where you like I return

He whips his robe over himself

MINUTES LATER

Wide on Mattie
down to bring Little

staggering toward us carrying a saddle We boom

Blackie into the foreground as Mattie takes the last few
stumbling steps forward almost at
a run so as to let her inertia help her heave the saddle up onto

the horses back

LeBoeuf

Mattie
I am going with you

cinching a saddle onto his woolly horse looks around

LeBoeuf
Oh that izh not poshible

Chelmshford izh
There izh

Mattie
Have I held you back I have a Colts dragoon

which I know how to use and I would be no more

burden to you than I was to the marshal

LeBoeuf
That izh not my worry You have earned your

izh clear enough--you have been a regular old
trail But Cogburn izh right even if I would not
shatishfaction of consheding it The trail izh
conshiderably diminished

Mattie
How can you give up now after the many months

dedicated to finding Chaney You have shown great

determination I misjudged you I picked the
LeBoeuf

I would go on in your company if there were clear

But we would be shtriking out blindly

gone--we have chaished him right off the map

nothing for it I am bound for Texash and it izh

to go home too

He swings himself up onto the horse

back

alive

The marshal when he shoberzh izh your way

Mattie
I will not go back Not without Chaney dead or

LeBoeuf
I misjudged you as well I eckshtend my hand
He does dropping a hand gloved in rough suede She refuses to
take it

Mattie
Mr LeBoeuf Please

He remains with hand extended She hesitates sees there is no
give and reaches for up for

the hand They shake

LeBoeuf
Adiosh

He saws the horse around and sets it to a prancing walk his
spurs jingling

The sound recedes leaving behind Roosters snoring from the
campfire

CAMPFIRE

Roosters snores bump up at the cut

Mattie enters gazes down for a thinking beat at the passed-out
lawman then lies down on

her robe

She lies still gazing up

After a long beat she abruptly rises

She recedes toward the horses As she reaches them we hear
Little Blackie snort and blow

Mattie returns with a length of coiled rope She plays it out in
a loop around her robe She

lies down again She closes her eyes

Fade out

EARY MORNING

We are high and close on Rooster asleep Face mottled red he
looks like hell He emits a

symphony of respiratory noises as breath fights through layers
of phlegm

Reverse on Mattie looking down at him
Wider on the forlorn campsite--Mattie standing

Rooster

awkwardly sprawled sleeping
LeBoeuf gone

Close on a bucket Matties hand enters to grab it

EMBANKMENT

We hear rushing water

Mattie descends

carefully stiff-legged down a steep slope

thick with trees and brush

She emerges

onto the bank of a fast-flowing stream shallow at

this point and loud

Mattie takes
behind her
four horses

Soft

Mattie stoops to fill the bucket

she sees the four

Surprised s

The horses h
wear tack--but the

a couple of steps into the water to dip the bucket
we see
watering at the opposite bank just downstream
Turning as she straightens
horses

he drops the bucket and stares

uff and blow in the water
re is no

They are not wild--they

rider in sight until

A man straightens and emerges from behind one of the horses The
first thing we notice

about him is the silhouette of the rifle projecting over one
shoulder slung to the mans

back with a piece of sash cord

He looks at something floating by in the stream Matties
bucket He looks up We jump

closer

The man has a black mark on his forehead

Seeing Mattie who still gapes at him he hastily swings his
rifle round and trains it on her

He takes cautious splashing steps forward

Chaney
Well now I know you Your name is Mattie You are

little

Mattie the bookkeeper Isnt this something
He grins relaxing He slings the rifle back over his shoulder

Mattie
Yes and I know you Tom Chaney

Chaney
What are you doing here

Mattie
I came to fetch water

Mattie pulls the flour sack from her coat pocket and works
carefully at the cord that
cinches it shut Chaney watches

Chaney
I mean what are you doing here in these
mountains

Mattie
I have not been formally deputized but I am
acting as an
agent for Marshal Reuben Cogburn and Judge
Parkers court

Mattie has the cinch loose She reaches the Colts Dragoon out
of the sack and points it at
Chaney

I have come to take you back to Fort Smith
Chaney looks at the gun He grins and puts hands on hips

Chaney
Well I will not go How do you like that

Mattie
There is a posse of officers up on the hill who
will force you
to go

Chaney
That is interesting news How many is up there

Mattie
Right around fifty They are all well armed and
they mean
business What I want you to do now is come on
across the
creek and walk in front of me up the hill

Chaney
I think I will oblige the officers to come after
me

Mattie
If you refuse to go I will have to shoot you

Chaney
Oh Then you had better cock your piece

Mattie gives a dismayed look at the gun and tries to pull the
hammer back It has a heavy

pull she struggles using two thumbs

Chaney watches smiling

All the way back til it locks

Mattie
I know how to do it

She pulls the hammer back further and we hear it notch She
looks up

You will not go with me

Chaney
I think not It is just the other way around You
are going

with me I will--

Mattie fires

Chaney shocked takes a staggering step back

Mattie stumbles and falls back under the recoil into the stream
but careful to hold the gun

high and dry She awkwardly reclaims her footing and retrains
the gun Chaney is looking

down at his bleeding side

Chaney
I did not think you would do it

Mattie
What do you think now

Chaney
One of my short ribs is broken It hurts jiggers
every breath
I take

Mattie
You killed my father when he was trying to help
you I have
one of the gold pieces you took from him Now
give me the
other

She is struck by a worrying thought She hastily recocks the
gun

Chaney
I regret that shooting Mr Ross was decent to
me but he
ought not to have meddled in my business

Crashing from the brush up the hill and a voice

Rooster
Mattie

Mattie
I am down here Chaney is taken into custody

Chaney
I was drinking and I was mad through and
through Nothing
has gone right for me

There is yelling from the other bank now too

Mattie
No you are just a piece of trash that is all
Chaney
Everything is against me Now I am shot by a
child

He sloshes suddenly forward water kicking up before him

Mattie
Stop

She squeezes the trigger but the gun dry fires

Chaney grabs the gun and flings it away then holds on to Mattie
and slaps her
Mattie
Help me Down here Hurry up

Two men burst through the brush from Chaneys side of the river
One is in woolly chaps

--Lucky Ned Pepper The other is taller and dressed almost
formally in a linen suit and

string tie and a bear coat Both men bear Winchester repeating
rifles

Chaney is dragging Mattie to their bank slapping at her along
the way

Rooster emerges from his side of the riverbank carrying a side
arm

The men exchange fire

Lucky Ned
(to Chaney)
Take them horses you got and move

He grabs Mattie from Chaney and keeps her between himself and
the far bank as he fires
again

One hand to his bleeding side Chaney lunges for the horses
leads

Rooster has retreated back to the tree cover as has the well
dressed man on our side

Intermittent gunshots and the panicked neighing of horses Lucky
Ned falls back into the

trees with Mattie and starts pulling her up the steep hill

Chaney follows pulling the string of horses He is breathing
hard and blood stains the front
of his shirt

Lucky Ned
(to Chaney)
Get on up that hill Dont you stop

He twists Mattie around to face him and we see him clearly for
the first time Part of his
upper lip and three of his front teeth are missing

Who all is down there

Mattie
Marshal Cogburn and fifty more officers
Lucky Ned throws Mattie to the ground He puts a muddy boot on

her neck

Mattie manages

Silence

girl You know

Arkansas

me but a

A short beat t
Then Roosters voice
again

double fast

northwest I will

He breaks open

Lucky Ned
Tell me another lie and I will stove your head
to choke out

Mattie
Just the marshal

Lucky Ned
Cogburn Do you hear me

You answer me Rooster I will kill this
I will do it
Roosters Voice
The girl is nothing to me She is a runaway from
Lucky Ned

That is very well Do you advise me to kill her

Roosters Voice
Do what you think is best Ned She is nothing to

lost child

hrough which we hear only the rush of riverwater

Think it over first
Lucky Ned
I have already thought it over You get mounted
If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the
spare the girl You have five minutes
his rifle and starts to reload

Rooster
I will need more than five minutes
Lucky Ned
I will not give you more time

Rooster
There will be a party of marshals in here soon
Ned Let me
have Chaney and the girl and I will mislead them
for six
hours

Lucky Ned
Too thin Rooster Too thin Your five minutes is
running
No more talk

He pulls Mattie to her feet Roosters voice trails away

Roosters Voice
I am leaving but you must give me time

Lucky Ned gives Mattie a rough push

Lucky Ned
Up that hill

Mattie advances Lucky Ned giving periodic shoves from behind

A stout young man with a shotgun leaps out from behind a slab of
limestone in front of

them He has a round face and idiot eyes

He makes loud turkey-gobbling noises at Mattie

Though Mattie is startled Lucky Ned does not immediately react
but he does finally tire of
the turkey noises

Lucky Ned
Quiet there

The idiot makes a pig-squealing sound in acknowledgment and then
falls quiet loping

alongside Mattie and Lucky Ned

Mattie
You will not shoot me

Lucky Ned is grim

Lucky Ned
I will do what I have to do

They are ascending out of the trees onto a bare rock ledge not
quite at the crest of the

mountain The rock floor is uneven and broken by fissures and
holes A cave-like setback

at the far end of the rock shelf is half-curtained with a hide
A rough camp

A cookfire burns on the open rock Two coffeepots warm leaning
against the inside of the
fires piled-stone perimeter A skillet holds bacon

A man squats at the fire holding a piece of bacon turned to
watch Lucky Ned and Matties

approach He wears a filthy Union army uniform with officers
boards His mouth is an 0

of surprise

Mattie
Can I have some of that bacon

Lucky Ned
Help yourself Have some of the coffee

Mattie
I do not drink coffee I am fourteen

Lucky Ned
We do not have buttermilk And we do not have
bread We
are poorly supplied What are you doing here

Tom Chaney has reached the rock ledge and he charges Mattie with
a yell

Chaney
I will wring your scrawny neck

Lucky Ned knocks him aside

Lucky Ned
Let that go Farrell see to his wound What
happened
What are you doing here

Mattie
I will tell you what and you will see that I am in
the right
Smith and
Her name

Most girls

blowing and

Tom Chaney there shot my father to death in Fort
robbed him of two gold pieces and stole his mare
is Judy but I did not see her down at the river I
informed Rooster Cogburn had grit and I hired him
find the murderer A few minutes ago I came upon
watering the horses He would not be taken in

shot him If I had killed him I would not be now
My revolver misfired

Lucky Ned
They will do it It will embarrass you every time

like to play pretties but you like guns do you

Mattie
I do not care a thing in the world about guns If

have one that worked

Chaney
I was shot from ambush Ned The horses was

making noise It was that officer that got me

Mattie
How can you sit there and tell such a big story

Chaney squatting with his shirt pulled up for the ex-soldier to

work on his wound
rises

you into it

that

way He

now

Chaney
That pit is a hundred feet deep and I will throw

and leave you to scream and rot How do you like
Mattie
No you wont This man will not let you have your

is your boss and you must do as he tells you

Chaney turns to Lucky Ned who has a spyglass to his eye
scanning a ridge across the

river
Chaney
Five minutes is well up

Lucky Ned speaks quietly without lowering the glass

Lucky Ned
I will give him a little more time

From somewhere in the woods below we hear the idiots gobbling
noises

Chaney
How much more

Lucky Ned
Til I think he has had enough

The voice of the well dressed man floats up from the woods

Well Dressed Man

He is gone Ned I can see nothing We had best
make a

move

Lucky Ned
Hold fast a while there Doctor

Mattie looks at Chaney moaning in pain as the ex-soldier works
on his side

Mattie
Why doesnt the Doctor do that

Lucky Ned replies absently still gazing out
Lucky Ned
He is not a medical doctor Was that Rooster
waylaid us

night before last

Mattie
It was Marshal Cogburn and myself

Lucky Ned
Yourself eh You and Cogburn quite the posse

He sees something and hastily raises the glass
A horseman is ascending the treeless ridge across the river with
a riderless horse--Little

Blackie--in tow At the top he pauses and turns and draws a
revolver from his saddle and

points it skyward We see the gun kick and breathe gunsmoke A
second later we hear the

shot

Lucky Ned lowers the glass and takes a gun and shoots skyward
He raises the glass

again

The horseman turns away and proceeds on over the crest He is
gone

Lucky Ned turns to Mattie He comes and squats at the fire

Lucky Ned
Your friend is gone You are alone

The well dressed man and the idiot trudge up from the woods onto
the rock ledge

The man in the dirty uniform continues to perform crude field
surgery on Chaney digging

into his side with a knife to extract the bullet As Chaney
moans the idiot makes calf-

bawling noises in imitation

Well Dressed Man
We must move Ned

Lucky Ned
You are too nervous Doctor It will be hours
before he is
back with help

Lucky Ned turns back to Mattie
What happened to Quincy and The Kid

Mattie
They are both dead I was in the very middle of
it It was a
terrible thing to see Do you need a good lawyer

Lucky Ned
I need a good judge What about Coke Hayes--the
old
fellow shot off his horse
Mattie
Dead as well His depredations have come to an

end
Lucky Ned

Poor Coke He rode back for me Coke Hayes had
spine

and could keep his wits in a tight spot Dead now
but he

should have been dead ten times afore now Your
friend

Rooster does not collect many prisoners

Mattie
He is not my friend He has abandoned me to a
congress of
louts

Lucky Ned
You do not varnish your opinions

Well Dressed Man
Are we staying here for chat

The idiot is still bawling Chaney grabs a stone and flings it
at him and the idiot scampers

back making goat noises Chaney grabs moaning at the wound
aggravated by this fresh

exertion

The man in officers boards laughs

Soldier
Do an owl Harold
Idiot
Hoo Hoo Hoo
Chaney

Let us cut up the winnings from the Katie Flyer

Lucky Ned straightens from the fire and begins to collect his
meager belongings The
other men follow suit

Lucky Ned
There will be time for that at The Old Place

Chaney
I will saddle the grey
comes toa

Lucky Ned
I have other plans for you

Chaney
Must I double-mount with the Doctor

Well Dressed Man

Lucky Ned
No it will be too chancy with two men up if it

race You will wait here with the girl When we

reach Mas house I will

dark and we will wait for you at The Old Place

Chaney

Lucky Ned
No We are short a horse It cant be helped

Chaney
Marshals will come swarming

Lucky Ned
Hours if they come here at all They will guess

gone

Mattie
I am not staying here by myself with Tom Chaney

Lucky Ned
That is the way I will have it

Mattie
He will kill me You have heard him say it He has

my father and now you will let him kill me

Lucky Ned
He will do no such thing Tom you know the

Cypress Forks near the log meetinghouse When you

Chaney stares

understand that Tom If any harm comes to this

Chaney
Harold let me ride up with you

Idiot

Chaney

Soldier

The men clanking with gear cross the rock ledge and descend

into the woods

In the quiet

bandit chief

Chaney is disconsolate

Chaney
Everything is against me

Mattie
You have no reason to whine If you act as the

instructed and no harm comes to me you will

winnings at The Old Place

We faintly hear the rest of his party mount up and gallop off
Chaney drops heavily before
the fire to sit staring

Lucky Ned has

leave on

Chaney
They will not wait for me at The Old Place

left me knowing I am sure to be caught when I
foot

Mattie
He is sending a mount
Chaney
That was a story Keep still now I must think
over my
position and how I may improve it

A silent beat

Mattie
Where is the second California gold piece

Chaney continues to stare silently into the fire

Mattie
What have you done with Papas mare

Chaney
Keep still you little busybody

More brooding silence
Mattie
Are you thinking about The Old Place If you will
let me

go I will swear to it in an affidavit and once
you are brought
to justice it may go easier on you

Chaney rises glaring at her

Chaney
I tell you I can do better than that I do not
intend to be
caught I need no affidavit

He is striding toward her She backs toward the ledge

All I need is your silence And I will have
it
Without breaking stride he plows into her good hand raised to

catch her by the throat

She tumbles backward Chaney on top of her sweating and
snarling

Your father was a busybody like you There
are always
people who will tell you whats right
On her back Mattie struggles but Chaney straddling her has
her pinned His good hand is
still on her throat She claws at it

He swats her with his free hand Her clawing stops

Chaney is wincing from the swing of his own arm As he leans
over her his opened wound
dribbles blood onto Mattie along with his sweat

In honesty I do not regret shooting him
He thought
Tom Chaney was small Lucky Ned thinks the same
And
you would give me an affidavit

He reaches back awkwardly toward his calf with his bad hand
groaning with the stretch

We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a
knife taken from a leg sheath

You are all against me Everything is
against me

He pushes against the underside of Matties chin stretching her
neck

Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips
the knife and lowers it to
her throat his knuckles whitening with tension

But here at least I have matters in hand
and once I have
done for you--

Whack--a rifle stock swings into frame connecting with Chaneys
head His head snaps

to one side and then lolls back as he slowly straightens ropey
drool and blood pouring

from his mouth He sways briefly and then collapses onto Mattie

A hand enters to pull him off Mattie blearily props herself on
her elbows

LeBoeuf is panting and sweating from his climb He gazes down at
Chaney Once he has
breath

LeBoeuf
Sho that ish Chelmthford Shtrange to be sho
closhe at lasht

Mattie
How is it you are here

LeBoeufs look breaks from Chaney He pulls his pipe from his
pocket and lights it

LeBoeuf
I heard the shotsh and went down to the river

He crosses the rock ledge

Cogburn outlined a plan Hizh part I fear
izh rash
(reacts to hole) But that izh a pit there Mind
your footing

He skirts the large hole and reaches the shelfs far lip and
gazes out Before him is a steep

drop-off We see the very crowns of near pines and then four
hundred yards away the

land flattening to an open meadow

Mattie also gazing out comes up beside LeBoeuf

Mattie
A plan

LeBoeuf points with his pipe

LeBoeuf
He returnzh for Lucky Ned

Lucky Ned the Parmalees and the Doctor are just entering the
low meadow riding away

As they do so Rooster enters at the far side facing He draws
one of his navy sixes as he

advances

Mattie
One against four It is ill advised

Leboeuf shrugs

LeBoeuf
He would not be dishuaded
He and Mattie both watch as below the parties advance on each
other at a walk Eighty
yards separating them they halt

THE MEADOW
Rooster and Lucky Ned eye each other After a beat

Lucky Ned
Well Rooster will you give us the road

Idiot
Moo Moo

Rooster
Hello Ned How many men are with the girl

Lucky Ned
Just Chaney Our agreement is in force she was
in excellent
health when last I saw her

Rooster nods
A beat

Rooster
Farrel I want you and your brother to stand
clear You as
well Doctor I have no interest in you today

Lucky Ned
What is your intention Rooster Do you think
one on four is
a dogfall

Rooster
I mean to kill you in one minute Ned Or see
you hanged in

Fort Smith at Judge Parkers convenience Which
will you

have

Ned Pepper laughs

Lucky Ned
I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man

Idiot
Koo koo roo Blawk

Rooster
Fill your hand you son of a bitch

He puts the reins in his teeth grabs his other revolver with
the hand now free and spurs his

horse

ROCK LEDGE

Mattie watches him charge

The facing four charge to meet him

Mattie
Shoot them Mr LeBoeuf

LeBoeuf
Too far moving too fasht

Over the distant laughter of the idiot the crackle of gunfire
commences

THE MEADOW

Rooster turns his head to either side as he fires bringing his
good eye into play

The idiot is gaily waving a revolver over his head not firing
squawking like a chicken as
he charges

A shot from Rooster kills him and swipes him neatly off his
horse

Farrel Parmalee has a shotgun It roars
Shot peppers Rooster He returns fire

Farrel Parmalees horse is hit It stumbles and Farrel is
dashed forward snapping his
neck

The Doctor Indian-rides past sliding down and hooking an ankle
on his saddle so that he

may ride in the cover of his horses body He makes for the
treeline on the far side of the
meadow
Rooster and Lucky Ned are charging each other both firing

They pass each other--both still mounted--but Roosters horse
has been hit and it falls

pinning Roosters leg His guns are gone lost in the fall

Rooster bleeding from sprayed shot in neck face and shoulder
struggles and unpins his
leg

ROCK LEDGE

LeBoeuf sits cross-legged and brings the butt of his Sharps
carbine to rest against his

injured shoulder He nudges the gunstock back and forth looking
for the anchor that will

cause him the least pain He cocks his head to sight puffing
pipesmoke

MEADOW
Lucky Ned is reining his horse around with his left hand His
right arm dangles He walks
his horse toward Rooster who is getting to his feet
Lucky Ned
Well Rooster I am shot to pieces It seems
neither of us is to

see Judge Parker

He drops the reins to reach out a gun with his one working arm

ROCK LEDGE
LeBoeuf sighting

LeBoeuf
Oh lord

He squeezes the trigger

He screams as the gun roars and bucks back into his shoulder

THE MEADOW
Rooster is facing Lucky Ned

Lucky Ned raises his gun at Rooster and--is shot in the chest

As we hear the weakly distant guncrack Ned flops backward
slides halfway down one side

of the saddle and dangles briefly foot tangled in a stirrup

horse standing unperturbed

Then he drops

ROCK LEDGE
Mattie whoops as LeBoeuf groans

Mattie
Some bully shot Four hundred yards at least

LeBoeuf sets the rifle down and gropes at his shoulder

LeBoeuf
I am afraid I have--

A rock is brought down on his head by Tom Chaney
Mattie screams

LeBoeuf has collapsed and is motionless Chaney drops the rock
and stoops for the rifle

Mattie is already dragging it away She grabs it up

Mattie
Stand up Tom Chaney

Chaney stands nearly straight--as much as his injuries will
allow and--

Boom--the blast catches Chaney in the chest and he is blown
back off the ledge looking

surprised He falls to oblivion

But the carbine recoil pushes Mattie stumbling back and this
with the bad footing at the lip

of the pit behind her sends her falling

PIT
Mattie is tumbling She bounces down a very steep slope
disturbed earth tumbling with

her protruding roots and slender upgrowing foliage slapping at
her on her descent

As she descends more or less feet-first something snags an ankle
and her inertia sends her

upper body on down past the pinned leg She jerks to a halt
head-downmost on the steep

slope

The patter of falling dirt subsides Silence Heavy breathing

Mattie lying face-up does a painful half sit-up to look
around

Above her her left foot is snarled through some roots Well
beyond very high weak light
defines the mouth of the pit

Using her elbows she pivots scooting her upper body uphill so
that she is no longer below

her foot She reaches the cuff of her pants on the trapped leg
and pulls it up to expose the

shin

A splinter of broken bone has punctured the skin

She pulls the cuff back down

She stretches to slip fingers between her boot and the roots in
which it is fouled She just

manages to work in two fingers in wrenching around the root
has cinched tight She tugs

feebly at the root which shows no signs of give

She looks back up

The small hole of weak daylight dust drifting up toward it

Mattie
Mr LeBoeuf Are you alive

No answer
Mr LeBoeuf

Arms tiring she lays back again against earth She looks
around

Partway round the pit just at her level something difficult to
discern in the semi-dark two
mirroring shapes close to each other is it the soles of a pair
of boots

Mattie squints She props herself partway up

Higher view they are boots--worn by a corpse--stretching away
from us foreshortened

The mans skull has been partly shattered by the protruding rock
against which it rests

Mattie surveys the body Her attention is caught by something

The skeletal remains are still clothed and there seems to be
something held by a bandolier

strapped across the chest over the bodys decomposing blue
shirt but beneath a tattered

vest A sheath is just visible high on the strap near the
corpses shoulder The butt-end of

a knife juts out

Mattie stretches reaching

She can just get to a boot

She pulls

The mans remains seem to be fairly light They drag across
earth raising dust tending to

slide away with the grade of the pit

Mattie reels the body in careful not to let go and lose it down
the hill She pulls shoe

pants cuff pants knee belt The bandolier is close

Her fingers curl around shirt and pull

The shirts buttons softly pop and fiber dust drifts up as the
fabric falls to pieces Rib cage

is exposed beneath

Mattie hastily reaches and curls fingers around ribs She pulls
She is about to get the

knife when--

A glistening something inside the rib cage--guts--starts to
slowly move But it cant be

guts it is gliding coiling under its own power

A faint rattle
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens One snake
starts to slowly emerge
and she bats the body away

She pushes and kicks with her free leg as much as her pinned
attitude will allow The

body coming to pieces slides dustily down into the dark It
disappears Fiber and bone

dust float up toward us We hear rattles

Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic
pulls looking back

toward the body The root holds fast

A snake is sluggishly and sinuously weaving up the earth toward
her She muscles her
body upward so that once again her pinned leg is bottom-most

Mattie
Mr LeBoeuf

Another snake is behind the first several more behind that

As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie
freezes The first snake

continues climbing weaving up the slope alongside Matties
body She watches it come

on its blunted head with its flicking tongue inches from her
face The head passes the

body goes coiling by

Another snake undulates onto her pinned leg

Roosters Voice
Are you there

Careful to keep still eyes on the advancing snakes

Mattie
I am here

More snakes climb onto her

Roosters Voice
Can you clamber out

Mattie
I cannot

A large snake is winding onto her shoulder She gingerly places
a hand for it to coil onto
it does she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off
There are snakes

Rooster
Awake

Mattie
Yes

Rooster appears in the mouth of the pit He has a rope wrapped
round his waist and he

starts to descend half walking half hopping against the pit
wall

Mattie winces and looks down at one hand

A small snake wrapped round her wrist has its fangs in the meat
of the hand

Mattie
Ahh
Rooster
What is that
She flaps her hand and the snake plops off
Mattie

I am bit

BAM--a burst of orange as Rooster descended to the level of
the lead snakes starts firing

his revolver

BAM BAM More orange lightning flashes

Lively rattling

The pit fills with roiling gunsmoke

Rooster starts to stomp as well as fire He kicks the more
sluggish specimens toward the

bottom of the pit

He reaches Mattie and takes out a knife

Mattie
Does Mr LeBoeuf survive

Rooster
He does--even a blow to the head could silence
him for only
a few short minutes Where are you bit

She shows her hand and he makes two slices in the flesh and
squeezes out blood As he
does so

He is in mild distress having swallowed a
good piece of
his pipestem Can you move

Mattie
My foot is pinned and leg broken

Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted
foot He wraps one arm
around Matties waist and tips his head back and bellows

Rooster
I have her Up with us

The rope tautens and starts pulling Rooster helping with his
feet

THE LEDGE

Little Blackie led by a wobbly LeBoeuf finishes pulling
Rooster and Mattie from the pit

Rooster is already unwrapping the rope from his waist and
talking to LeBoeuf as he and
Mattie emerge

Rooster
I will send help for you as soon as I can Dont
wander off

Mattie
We are not leaving him

Rooster heaves her up onto the back of Little Blackie LeBoeuf
helping though blood still
flows down one side of his face

Rooster
I must get you to a doctor sis or you are not
going to make
it (to LeBoeuf) The girl is snakebit We are

off
He swings up behind her and nods down to LeBoeuf
I am in your debt for that shot pard
LeBoeuf
Never doubt the Texash Ranger
Rooster reins the horse around and spurs it LeBouef shouts
after

Ever shtalwart

The horse takes to the steep slope reluctantly with stiff legs
Rooster kicking it on Tree

branches slap at him and take his hat His face already
peppered with shot gets new

scratches

THE MEADOW

Mattie is woozy As Little Blackie crosses the field at full
gallop Mattie looks blearily at

the littering bodies of horses and men

Next to Lucky Neds body his horse saddled and riderless
swings its head to watch as

Rooster and Mattie pass

Matties eyes are closing

LATE DAY

Matties eyes half-open

Little Blackie plunges on through a rough road in woods but
slower now his mouth

foaming

Rooster
Come on you

Mattie
We must stop Little Blackie is played out
Horrible noises are indeed coming from the horse but Rooster is
grim

Rooster
We have miles yet

He leaves off whipping the horse and takes out his knife He
leans back and slashes at the
horses whithers Little Blackie surges

Mattie screams

Mattie
No

A locked-down shot as horse and riders enter at a gallop and
recede

NIGHT

It has started to snow

Mattie is flushed and soaked with sweat

The horse is laboring for breath

Rooster gives inarticulate curses as he kicks it on

Mattie looks ahead

Barely visible in the moonlight a man mounted bareback rides on
ahead A sash cord

holds a rifle to his back

He recedes outpacing us disappearing into the darkness and the
falling snow

Mattie
He is getting away

Rooster
Who is getting away

Mattie
Chaney

Rooster

Hold on sis
Mattie is falling It is unclear why

Her legs squeeze the horses flanks

Her hand tightens on the horses mane
Roosters arm reaches around to hold her

Little Blackie is giving out going to his knees and then all
the way down

Rooster hangs on to Mattie as the horse sinks He pulls her
clear lays her on the ground
and then steps away from her taking out a gun

The horrible noises coming from the horse end with a gunshot
Rooster reenters to pick up

Mattie but she screams at him and claws at his face opening
fresh gashes

He ducks his head as best he can to avoid the claws but that is
the extent of his reaction

Rooster
Put your arms around my neck I will carry

He presents his back and she relents clasping her arms He
rises with a pained wheeze and
he starts jogging with Mattie piggie-back

Bouncing at his shoulder she twists to look back

In the dark the darker shape of the dead horse growing
smaller

Mattie turns forward again eyes drooping

LATER

Rooster is loudly wheezing as he carries Mattie before him now
his jog slowed to an
unsteady walk Her eyes are opening again

They are now on a proper dirt road Rooster staggers around a
turn and does a barely

controlled stumble to his knees and then sits heavily back
Mattie in his lap

Up ahead is the front porch of Bagbys store the building dark
Rooster sits gasping
Matties voice is thick

Mattie
Where are we

Rooster takes out his gun weakly raises his arm and fires into
the air He sits panting

Rooster
I have grown old

The door of the distant store opens and someone emerges holding
a lamp peering out into
the dark

FADE OUT

TRAIN

We are looking into the window of a moving train Looking out
past us is a thin forty-

year-old woman

Reflected in the window is a sizable railyard and then as the
train slows a station

Reading backward in the mirror of the window is the station
stop MEMPHIS

We hear the voice familiar from the opening of the movie of
the grown Mattie Ross

Voice-Over
A quarter of a century is a long time

TRAIN DOOR

As the train eases to a stop the woman Mattie steps down One
sleeve of her dress is
pinned up

Voice-Over
I had written a letter of thanks to Marshal
Cogburn with an
invitation to visit along with the fifty dollars
I owed him
In his reply he promised he would try to call
next time he

came to Fort Smith with prisoners Brief though
his note

was it was rife with misspellings

Mattie goes along the platform holding a small bag in one hand
and crushed against its
handle a flier

The marshal did not visit nor did he

communicate

further I had not been conscious during his
leavetaking by

the time Bagby rode us to Fort Smith my hand had
turned

black I was not awake when I lost the arm I
later learned

that Mr LeBoeuf recovered fully When the
marshals found

him he was searching the pines below the rock
ledge for

Tom Chaneys body He found it and took it back
to San

Saba for the reward It was well earned

In the scene Mattie calls peremptorily to a young boy on the
platform

Mattie

The boy looks up and points

Mattie crosses the platform and further along descends to the
railyard
The cars of the Wild West Show are parked along a siding They
display gaudily painted

scenes of men on rearing horses firing six-guns of conestoga
wagons war-bonneted

Indians bandana-wearing bad men Three featured performers have
their own vignetted

scenes each depicted as a youngish man engaged in Wild West
hell-raising each with his

name painted beneath Cole Younger Frank James and
(unrecognizable but for the

eyepatch) Rooster Cogburn Below Roosters name is the sublegend
He rode with

Quantrill He rode for Parker

Around the rail cars cowboys--and some Indians--mill more
wobegone than their painted
representations

Mattie asks someone along the way for directions and is pointed
toward the rear of the
train

Voice-Over

Little Frank had sent me the flier He had
chaffed me

through the years over the fact that I had not

liked jokes

and they are all right in their place I have
never held it

against either one of them for leaving me at home
to look

Mattie speaks to two men who sit on the rear platform of the
rear car They are old men

drinking Coca-Colas One doffs his hat and rises when Mattie
addresses the pair the other

stays seated slurping from his bottle
