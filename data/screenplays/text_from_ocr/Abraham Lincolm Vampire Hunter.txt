A LARGE CROWD

has gathered on the North Lawn of the White House CHANTING
below a second-floor balcony -- demanding a glimpse of their
President

CROWD
Lincoln Lincoln

We PULL BACK TO REVEAL that weve been looking though a
window FURTHER BACK - all the details of the Presidents
office coming into view

BACK until we see the Lconic ABRAHAM LINCOLN sitting at
his desk writing in a small leather-bound journal by
candlelight

Finished he puts down his pen stands and straightens his
coat -- leaving the journal open on his desk

CLOSER to the open page as he walks away closer to the words
in tight loops of black ink as we hear their AUTHORS VOICE

ABE (V0O)
History prefers legends to men

CUT TO
INT A LOUISVILLE PUB - 1829 NIGHT
TITLE LOUISVILLE KENTUCKY -- 36 YEARS EARLIER

Filled with HAPPY DRUNKS at this late hour -- some playing
cards some SINGING A LONE CUSTOMER sits at the bar -- the
only man not taking part in the merriment Two items in front
of him a glass of whisky and a small leather-bound journal
-- the same one we just saw but less-worn

ABE (V0O)
It prefers nobility to brutality
soaring speeches to quiet deeds
We see his broad back -- his large hand as it grabs the glass
for one last shot

ABE (VO) (CONT’D)

History remembers the battleand
forgets the blood

He opens the journal to its first page to a slightly faded
inscription

We merely pass to dust

but our words and deeds live forever

CUSTOMER (0S
(finishes his drink then)
Happy birthday Mama
CLOSER to those words as we --

SMASH TO

EXT THE JRB SHIPPING COMPANY - NIGHT

The dark waters of the Ohio River LAP the wood piers of this
moonlit waterfront Mist snakes up through the floorboards

ABE (V0O)

Whatever history remembers of me if

it remembers anything at all it shall

be only a fraction of the truth
A MAN IN SHADOW
tall and cloaked his eyes firmly fixed on --
JACK BARTS
An almost comically-short portly man (40s) who scans the
night as he steps out of his office fumbling with a set of

KEYS in an attempt to lock his office door

This 1s especially difficult because hes missing his right
arm just below the elbow -- his sleeve neatly pinned

ABE (V0O) (CONT’D)
For whatever else I am a husband a
lawyer a President

He groans in effort until -- CLICK -- it locks

ANOTHER CLICK But this one Barts cant account for
He SPINS -- abnormally fast -- and takes in his shadowy
onlooker Sizing him up bracing himself

ABE (V0O) (CONT’D)
I shall always think of myself first
and foremost as an assassin

The figures arm WHIPS UP and a PISTOL FIRES sharply -- dark
mist electrified in muzzle flash as we watch --

THE SLOW MOTION BULLET

escape the flaming barrels end The bullet spins through the
air until it sticks in Bartss left eye -- the back of a
builet where his pupil used to be

As he blinks feeling his new metal eyeball --

BARTS
MY EYE YOUVE TAKEN MY EYE

Reloading hurriedly the assailants quaking fingers betray
some fear at Bartss fury Why isnt he dead

BARTS (CONT’ D)
Youyoure Thomas Lincolns boy
(fangs out)
Ill tear out your heart

And Barts LEAPS -- far beyond what an ordinary man should be
able TIME SLOWS as his flight halts on the end of a --

RELOADED PISTOL We see the SLO-MO distress in Bartss good
eye as the barrel enters his howling mouth mid-flight and --

FIRES -- a gaping exit wound SPLATTERS out of the back of his
head and Barts falls like a heap of broken sticks Blood
fountaining from his twin head wounds

Trembling the murderer steps from the shadows revealing --

ABRAHAM LINCOLN

No characteristic beard in these early years in fact
his face is almost boyish save for the deep horror splashed
across it - Ive just killed a man

Abe looks down at the gun in his hand tosses it down the
pier It CLATTERS into the water as he turns - stepping into
the night until --
A SHUFFLING behind him Abe freezes slowly turns

Jack Barts is rising to his feet

BARTS (CONTD)
You dare attack me

Only Jack Barts is gone Hes been replaced by something
else A demon -- a one-eyed one-armed demon

ON ABE Confused and terrified by what he sees until he

remembers - Shit The gun Abe makes his move toward the
pier --
But Barts cuts him off -- his clawed fingers gripping the

back of Abes head and BASHING it into the planks

Ribbons of blood pour from Abes face Barts snarls and drags
a finger through themtastes the blood

BARTS (CONT’D)
Your heart must be racing
(beat)
Weil put an end to that
Barts plunges Abes head below the water
FROM ABES POV

THRASHING as he drownsuntil a strange calm washes over
him

He watches the trails of his blood dance through the
waterwatches the boney white fingers as they grip him in
vicious glee Itll all be over soon But --

BARTS VANISHES in a blurry instant Abes head remains
beneath the surface too weak to move until a hand (the hand
of God) pulls him up and TOSSES HIM on the pier

ABES SIDEWAYS POV

as an epic fight plays out in the shadowy mist
The waterfront SHAKES WOOD SPLINTERS in the dark

Abe watches Barts LEAP -- incredibly -- onto a distant
rooftop Still GASPING for breath he sees his opportunity to
escape and takes it struggling to his feet and running

Losing consciousness with every step

Abe begins to pass out -- THE WORLD TILTING ON ITS AXIS as he
falls forward and --

EXT WOODS - DUSK
TITLE 9 YEARS EARLIER
A FLASHBACK BEGINS as Abe --
-- SMACKS -- headlong inte dead leaves ABRAHAM LINCOLN picks himself up and keeps on running

ABE (V0)
Indiana was the wild frontier in those
days Some settlers called it the
dark country

Young Abe and his friends -- WILL (African-American) SAMUEL
and JACOB -- run as the last daylight fades to darkness The
trees around them seem strangely sinister painting-like

ABE (VO) (CONTD)
Like all frontier children I’d grown
up hearing the strange noises that
seemed to greet each sunset
(beat)
Id grown up afraid

They reach the edge of an especially dense dark bit of woods
peppered with faded stone markers -- a burial ground The
other boys continue but Abe stops dead

YOUNG ABRAHAM
(scared)
Maybe we should take the long way
around

As if in answer a DISTANT SHRIEK echoes through the trees
Fuck it As he continues briskly into the graves
WILL
Cmon

As Abe hits his stride he sees something emerge from the
darkness ahead ——

THE SHAPE OF A MAN

running in the opposite direction no more than twenty yards
to their right Running in fear Running for his life

ABE (V0O)
At first I thought it was only my
imaginationa deer made to look
human by a trick of the light
Abes eyes are drawn skyward by the shape of --

ANOTHER MAN

jumping across the treetops above Soaring fifty yards at a
time - chasing the terrified adult Impossible

ABE (VO) (CONTD)
But this was no trick

His eyes locked on the treetops Abe doesn’t see a gnarled
thicket of Briar Bush in his path He YELPS as he --

Crashes into it His panicked CRIES growing the more he
struggles -- thorns tearing his clothes binding him tighter

YOUNG ABRAHAM
HELP HELP ME

Samuel and Jacob race ahead but --
WILL

stops turns back Pulling a small knife he races to Abe’s
side and HACKS at the briars freeing his friend

But once hes freed Abe just stands there -- dumbfounded -
watching that shape leap from branch-to-branch until Will
yanks him by his shirtcollar

WILL
RUN stupid
And thats exactiy what they do

EXT THE LINCOLN CABIN — LATER
Nancy hurries to Abe as he finally emerges from the trees

NANCY
Abraham Lincoln
(grabs his face)
You know full well you’ re to be home
before dark

YOUNG ABRAHAM
I’m sorry mama I --

NANCY
Don’t you scare me like that again

She drags him away SCOLDING him as a GUST moves through the
trees RATTLING their bare branches like skeletal fingers

Abe looks back over his shoulder toward the woods as a
distant sound -- almost a SCREAM -- rings out

ABE (VO)
I dare not tell her what Id seen
dest she worry even more than she
already did

EXT THE BARTS FARM — DAY

RAIN beats down on the main house barn and other
outbuildings Nancy is dry under the houses covered porch
sweeping water down its steps Her son and husband however
arent as lucky

Abe stands at the foot of a ladder a coat held over his head
in a futile attempt to stay dry as Thomas HAMMERS away at
the barns leaky roof above

YOUNG ABRAHAM
Father

THOMAS
(eyes on his work)
Hmmm
YOUNG ABRAHAM
You think theres such a thing
asvampires

Thomas pauses then resumes HAMMERING
YOUNG ABRAHAM (CONTD)
Jacob Grigsby says there is He said

they’ve got teeth like knives

THOMAS
That’s enough Abraham

YOUNG ABRAHAM
He says his pa saw one up clo --

THOMAS
IT said ENOUGH

Thomas looks down from his perch
THOMAS (CONT’D)
I don’t want to hear another word on

YOUNG ABRAHAM
Yessir

THOMAS
Now fetch me the saw

Abe does as hes told -- carrying the saw up the ladder and
exchanging it for the hammer But as he climbs down --

FARMHAND (0S)
(distant)
Clumsy sonofabitch

The voice draws Abes eyes to a commotion on the porch of the
main house -- some 40 yards from where he stands

WILL

hurriedly cleans off a WHITE FARMHANDS shirt after bumping
into him with a basket of eggs -- yolk everywhere

FARMHAND (CONT’D)
Look what you did

WILL
I didn’t mean --
The farmnand grabs Will shoves him against the side of the
house takes off his belt and WHIPS him across the back

His SCREAM makes Abe wince and Thomas stop his work

Wills face contorts in agony as the belt tears through his
shirt a second time -- into the flesh of his back

YOUNG ABRAHAM
(begins to yell Will
Wr --

THOMAS
QUIET

Thomas glares down sternly
THOMAS (CONTD)
Look away Abraham Its not our place
to interfere

As if reinforcing this Abe sees --

OTHER WORKERS

some black others white do the same They look away -- eyes

on their work as Will is beaten Its not our place

For a moment Abe does what hes told He looks away as --

Will collapses and crawls across the porch down the stairs --

but the farmhand doesn’t let up
WILL
(through tears)
PLEEEASE

Abe looks down at the hammer in his hand fist clenched

Fuck it He takes off running toward the main house

ABE (VO)
I hadnt the slightest idea what I was
doing

THOMAS
ABRAHAM

Abe cuts through the downpour -- raises his left hand

ABE (VO)
I only knew that I could not stand
idly while my friend suffered
ABES HAMMER

sails through the droplets --spinning end over end

and HITS the farmhand in the mouth He brings a hand to
his bloody lip -- too stunned to see Abe slide up beside --

YOUNG ABRAHAM
Give me your hand Will

Wills in too much pain to move Abe is suddenly picked up by
the collar --

FARMHAND
You little sack of sh --

-- and PUNCHED in the gut Everything goes SLOW again

Abe clutches his stomach doubles over He falls to his
knees then onto his side -- coming face-to-face with --

WILL

lying in the mud Raindrops mixing with the blood running
down his back the tears on his cheeks

WHACK Now the belt HITS Abes back as the farmhand unleashes
his rage Hes raising the belt for a second hit when --
CLOCK -- he leaves his feet as Thomas lays him out with a
right hook

BARTS (0S)
What the hell is this

Only RAIN now Its the voice no one wants to hear
JACK BARTS
stands on the porch master of all he beholds Finally
BARTS (CONTD)
(Thomas)

Did you strike this man

THOMAS
He was beating my so --

BARTS
DID YOU STRIKE THIS MAN Lincoln

THOMAS
You cant treat us like slaves Were
free men

The farmhand gets to his feet seething He gives Barts a
look -- asking his permission Barts shakes his head -- no

BARTS

Very well Mr Lincoln If its
freedom you wantconsider yourself
free from the burden of my employ

As Thomas reacts --

BARTS (CONTD)
And the debt youve been working off --
Id like it paid in full with
interest Now please

THOMAS
(losing his temper)
‘ve paid you back three times over

BARTS
Then youll pay me a fourth and be
happy to do it

THOMAS
f you get one more penny from me Mr
Barts
(steps forward)
tll come with a fist wrapped around
it

ABE (VO)
Id never been more proud of my father
than I was that daynor would I ever
forget the image of a poor man
standing up to his powerful
oppressor

THE OTHER WORKERS

cant help but hide their smiles Thomas is saying what
theyve dreamed of but dared not say

BARTS
Very well Mr Lincoln

Barts looks past him where --
NANCY
kneels over Abe in the rain wiping the blood from his brow
BARTS (CONTD)
There are other ways of collecting a
debt
EXT THE LINCOLN CABIN -— DAY

A lonely little outpost surrounded by dark woods on all
sides Thomas SPLITS logs in front SINGING happily while --

INT THE LINCOLN CABIN - SAME

Nancy dries her hands on her apron and checks on Abe -- whos

YOUNG ABRAHAM

NANCY

Well like your father says when put

But between you and me Sometimes its

OK to sock somebody in the nose

She smiles He smiles back Nancy flutters over to a high

it then unwraps a leather journal (the one hes dreamt of)

She leans in and kisses his forehead Abe examines the
journal for a moment then --

YOUNG ABRAHAM

Thomas enters carrying an armful of wood -- HUMMING
oblivious to their conversation

NANCY

And he means it As they share a hug

ABE (VO)
Our roof leaked in the spring the
bugs ate us alive in summer and we
froze half to death in winter

INT THE LINCOLN CABIN - NIGHT

The Lincolns are fast asleep Thomas and Nancy in their bed
Abe in his loft -- the last of a candle FLICKERING beside him
as he writes in his new journal

ABE (VO)
But we were together They were the
happiest days I would ever know
(beat)
And they were about to end

The candle suddenly CRACKLES and -- WHOOSH -- blows out on
its own as if by a spirit Abe hears the CREAKING of the
cabin door The FOOTSTEPS of someone entering

He pulls the covers over his head -- his breath quickened by
a sense of danger shuts his eyes and remains still Its
dark out there —- and theres something in that darkness
From the imagined safety of his covers he hears the
FOOTSTEPS recede as quickly as they camethe door CREAKS
shut He waits a long BEAT as his heart races then

Peeks his head cut Dark Quiet The candle suddenly FLICKERS
back to life on its own startling him as --

NANCY (PRE-LAP)
The DEVIL

SMASH TO
EXT THE LINCOLN CABIN - DAY
Horrible muffled SHRIEKS from inside
INT THE LINCOLN CABIN —- SAME

Nancy sweating and wild-eyed writhes on the bed restrained
by SEVERAL MEN -- SCREAMING delusional

NANCY
I see the eyes of the DEVIL

Abe cowers in the doorframe and watches as a DOCTOR places
his hand on Thomas’s shoulder and pulls him aside

We don’t hear their conversation but Thomas’s face tells us
all we need to know -- he begins to weep

ABE (VO)
The doctor had never seen anything
like it There was no diagnosis no
remedy no hope

Nancys arm FLAILS OUT where Thomas used to stand and Abe
runs to it He grabs her hand GASPS IN HORROR

THOMAS
Abraham get away

CLOSE ON MARYS ARM

Her veins are jet black and raised -- an ebony spiderweb
darkly throbbing -- almost breaking the skin

Abe watches as a branch of the spiderweb BURSTS in Marys
wrist She HOWLS as the blackness seeps within her flesh

ABE (VO)
There was only waiting

TIME CUT

Night has fallen and Nancy has drifted into a coma The
doctor is gone Thomas and Will have dozed off

Abe kneels at his mother’s bedside -- holding vigil as the
fire CRACKLES behind him He presses a compress to one of
the many hard black weits that now cover her body

She stirs He dips her compress in a bowl of water WRINGS it
out and puts it back on her forehead

A hand grabs his wrist

NANCY (0S)
(weak)
My baby
Nancy is suddenly completely lucid -- her face smiling and

warm her eyes on him She places a hand on Abe’s cheek

NANCY (CONT’ D)
My baby boy

Abes eyes come alive Its a miracle

YOUNG ABRAHAM
Mama

NANCY
We merely pass to dust Abraham

YOUNG ABRAHAM
(tears on his face)
Mama I thought you were -

NANCY
Our - our words

Her hand slips away eyes close muscles relax

NANCY (CONT’D)

Our deeds live

YOUNG ABRAHAM
Mama

As he shakes her crying and SHOUTING

PRIEST (PRE-LAP)
Speed her to thy Kingdom Lord

CUT TO

EXT A HILLSIDE OVERLOOKING THE CREEK -— DAY

Thomas stands over a mound of dirt and a small wooden grave
marker A PRIEST recites a prayer

YOUNG ABRAHAM
stands apart stone-faced and silent

ABE (VO0)
Mama once told me that I hadn’t cried
when I was bornthat I’d simply
opened my eyes looked at her smiling
face and smiled back
(beat)
My light was gone

The Priest blesses the grave then walks toward a distant
carriage Thomas and Abe remain The WIND whips

THOMAS
IT cant do it

A tear cuts through the dirt on Thomass face

THOMAS (CONT’D)
IT cant stand here and pretend
(beat)
I dont know how he did itbut God
help me I know he did

YOUNG ABRAHAM
Father

THOMAS
You and I both know it wasnt any
sickness that killed your mother

And something dies behind Abes eyes

THOMAS (CONT’D)
It was himit was Jack Barts
Most boys his age would scream cry Instead we see the
first glimpse of Abraham Lincolns quiet rage devotion on
his face He means it with every ounce of his little body
when he says --

YOUNG ABRAHAM
Then Iil kill him

THOMAS
Theres nothing we can do

YOUNG ABRAHAM
(growing angrier)
We can fight back

THOMAS
Noweve lost enough already
(turns to him)
Promise mepromise we you wont go
and do anything foolish

YOUNG ABRAHAM
You want me to look away

THOMAS
IT want you to LIVE

His voice has left a heavy silence in its wake As they stand
there -- their best clothes FLAPPING in the wind

CUT TO

A MONTAGE

Of Abe over the next eight years -- CIRCLING around him as he
grows bigger stronger

-- CIRCLING Young Abe as he sits beside his mothers grave --
writing in his journal

ABE (V0O)
I tried

CIRCLING as he CHOPS wood with an ax that weighs nearly as

much as he does -- his arms shaking as he raises it above his
head
ABE (VO) (CONTD)
For eight long years I tried to do as
Father told me tried to forget
-- CIRCLING around a TEENAGED ABE -- taller more muscular

CHOPPING wood on the same stump

A commotion draws his eyes to a neighboring cabin where two
WHITE CHILDREN look on helpless as a pair of WELL-DRESSED
MEN beat their FATHER for some unknown offense

ABE (VO) (CONTD)
Tried to look away

Abe looks down at the ax in his hands
ABE (VO) (CONTD)
But I couldnt stomach living as a
slave to fear
-- CIRCLING until at last we find ABRAHAM LINCOLN sitting at his mothers grave -- writing in his journal a

pistol beside him He stops -- looks at her grave marker

ABE (CONTD)
Happy birthday Mama

UP and a PISTOL FIRES sharply as we --

The FLASHBACK ENDS as we --

SMASH TO

INT HENRYS HOUSE (BEDROOM) - 1829 - DAY

Twenty-year-old Abe darts awake in bed and shields himself
from an attacker -- but hes alone drenched in sweat
Wearing pants and nothing else -- revealing the cuts and
bruises from his failed attack on Barts He takes ina
breath then the room

Red black and gold Minimal functional and beautiful
Daylight sneaking in though drawn curtains his --

LEATHER JOURNAL
waiting on a small bedside table

But none of that matters at the momentbecause a woman is
SCREAMING somewhere in this house

INT HENRYS HOUSE (HALLWAY) - MOMENTS LATER

Abe walks cautiously toward the source of the distress -- the
walls lined with mounted Katana swords guns and other
weaponry Abe grabs a sword from its perch as he goes

its Bartsit has to be

Scattered among the weapons various oil paintings -- most of
the same blonde woman Their styles evolving the skill of
their painter changing

And whisky bottles Lots and lots of empty whisky bottles
Tip-toeing -- ready to confront Barts with his Katana He
reaches a door at the end of the hall The screams are

clearly coming from behind it

Readying himselfone twoNOW He BARGES in and comes
face-to-face with --

A NAKED WOMAN

in a copper tub -- straddling a raven-haired fair-skinned
gentleman named Henry Sturges

Shit Those were screams of pleasure
ABE

(flummoxed)
Im Im sorr -- I thought --

Abe just stands there -- half embarrassed half enticed The
woman makes no attempt to cover up

HENRY
Might I suggest we begin by closing
the door

The door -- of course Abe does exactly that A BEAT in the
hall Shirtless Holding a sword

ABE
Im sorry I -- I didnt see anything
OK I saw everything but Im sorry

The door OPENS and the woman (holding a bundle of clothes to
shield her nakedness) emerges She studies Abe for a BEAT
CLOSES the door behind her and starts down the hall

HENRY (OS)
(through the door)
Who are you Where am I What
happened Shall we dive right in or
is she too distracting

A BEAT

Indeed Abe is watching the womans naked backside saunter
away Cdumbstruck

ABE
(snaps out)
Wha uh --
HENRY (0S)
Well I can hardly blame you for that
(beat)

Who I am is Henry Sturges where you
are is my home and what happened is
that you were very nearly done in by a
vampire

Wait -- did he just say
HENRY (OS) (CONT’D)
Fortunately for you Mr Lincoln --

hunting them is something of a hobby

ABE
A wha -- how do you know my name

Abe hears DRIPPING through the door -- the sounds of a man
getting out of the tub

HENRY (0S)
An eleven-year-old boy attacks the
employee of a wealthy vampire who in
turn kills the boys mother Yet
when the boy learns this -- he doesnt
seek revenge

The SOUNDS of a wardrobe opening

HENRY (OS) (CONT’D)
He controls his rage Channels it
Improves his body and mind through
labor through books And I like this
I think Heres someone I can teach
heres a recruit -- a fellow vampire
hunter But then I watch the boy
carry out his first hunt and I
realize -- hes an idiot Totally
unprepared Why I doubt he even knew
his target was a vampire

ABE
Jack Barts is avampire

HENRY (0S)

Yes well the living dont generally
beat you senseless after youve put
two bullets in their skull

(beat)
I wouldve intervened sooner but for
someone who had no idea what he was
fighting you were fighting
surprisingly well

ABE
(feels his ribswinces)
Next timefeel free to intervene

sooner

The door OPENS and Henry emerges fully dressed Suit
sunglasses and all

HENRY
Tell me Mr Lincoln - if you had a
choice between doing something truly
extraordinary -- changing the world
or seeing Jack Barts suffer at the end
of a bladewhich would it be

ABE
(thinks then)
I dont care about changing the
world Seeing Barts suffer would be
extraordinary enough

HENRY
Then I bid you good day

With that he continues down the hall

ABE
Wait where are you going

HENRY
Since you so rudely interrupted one of
my vices I plan on indulging the
other Its nearly nine oclock The
bars will be opening

EXT A BUSTLING ST LOUIS STREET - MOMENTS LATER

Henry emerges from his two-story brick house with its wide
double verandah Abe eagerly follows behind him

ABE
Wait You cant just say all that and
walk away

HENRY
And yet Im doing precisely that

Abe (who draws disapproving looks as he walks along
shirtless) is suddenly struck by a thought --

ABE
You could help me kill him Kill
Barts I could pay you

HENRY
The word youre looking for is
destroy Its quite a feat to kill
that which is already dead And my
services arent for sale

ABE
Then teach me Teach me to fight as
you do

HENRY
Mr Lincoln Im looking for soldiers
Men to devote themselves to a cause
men to fight a warnot boys with
scores to settle

Abe stops as Henry keeps walking

ABE
You dont understand My mother was
MURDERED

Henry stops turns back

HENRY
And if I teach you how to murder her
murderer So what How will it honor
her memory How will it benefit the
next boy whose mother is taken

An interesting point

HENRY (CONTD)

Did you think you were alone in your
suffering There is darkness
everywhere Mr Lincoln Right now on
this very street I can teach you how
to see it destroy it But I shall not
waste my time teaching you how to kill
one vampire Tf vengeance is all you

seek - seek it elsewhere
ABE
No I -- I want to learn Please Ill

do anything you say

HENRY
Then surrender

Not the reply Abe was expecting

HENRY (CONTD)
Rule number one what we do we do not

for ourselves -- not for one man but
for the good of all mankind
(beat)

To live by that rule you must
surrender all expectations of an
ordinary life Mr Lincoln Surrender
all notions of revenge Think youre
capable of that
24

As we HOLD on Abe considering his reply

ABE (V0O)
I told him what he wanted to hear and
hoped to God he believed me

CUT TO
EXT HENRYS HOUSE (HALLWAY) - LATER
Back in the hallway -- wall-mounted weapons of every kind
running its length
HENRY
Choose the weapon that speaks to you
Id suggest avoiding guns since that
didnt work out very well
Abe walks along -- passing throwing stars a Katana sword
Along the way he cant help but notice --
ABE
Who is she
Henry traces Abes eye-line to a painting -- the mysterious

blonde who occupies so much wall space
HENRY
Rule number two there are things one
must keep to ones self Choose

Abe continues past weapon after weapon with no luck He
reaches the window at the end of the hall and sees an --

AX

buried in a stump outside beside a pile of firewood Henry
steps behind him Looking out the window

ABE
Father says a man isnt a man till he
can handle an ax

HENRY
Then let us see you handle it

CUT TO

EXT A DENSE FOREST — DAY

The trees here soaring thick Henry motions to the
particularly thick tree beside him

HENRY
Before we can begin you must cut this
down with a single swing

Abe studies the trunk

ABE
That tree Impossible It has to be
four feet across

HENRY
Oh but it isnt a tree Its what you
hate most in the world
(beat)
So tell me Mr Lincoln - what do you
hate

ABE
(thinks then)
I hateJack Barts

HENRY
Very well
(the tree)
Then strike him down

Henry steps aside Abe (who thinks this whole thing is
stupid) raises his ax and STRIKES -- barely chipping bark

HENRY (CONTD)
Clearly you dont hate him that much
(a beat)
Tell me what you hate

ABE
(sighs then)
I hatevampires

Henry motions to the tree Abe SWINGS The blade lodges in
the trunk but doesnt go very far through it

HENRY
Pathetic Tell me what you hate

ABE
(thinks deeper)
I hateI hate that my mother was
taken away

Henrys getting under his skin breaking him down We see him
raw Slowly it begins to roll

ABE (CONTD)
I hate that we were afraid That

Mother Father -- that everyone we
knew lived in fear
(beat)

I hateI hate that I was
He suddenly begins to break down -- tears in his eyes
HENRY
Too small Too weak That you failed

to protect her

ABE
Yes

HENRY
That you let her DIE

Abe SCREAMS and STRIKES the tree -- SHATTERING its trunk
debris everywhere as the rest CRASHES to the earth

Spiinters FALLING like raindrops A long BEAT
ABE
(realizing)
I hateme
Henrys look clearly says -- thats what I was waiting for
HENRY
(re the other trees)
Now cut them all down
CUT TO
EXT RIVERBANK - NIGHT

Henry and a thoroughly exhausted Abe stand atop a pile of
downed trees just above the flowing waters below

HENRY
Wellif vampire hunting doesnt work
out youll be a helluva woodsman

ABE
(out of breath)
Mymy arms feel like theyre going
to fall off

HENRY
Then lets give your legs a try

Henry KICKS out the tree trunk that Abe stands upon --
sending it floating out into the river

ABE
What are you doing

HENRY
Rule number three expect the
unexpected

Abe struggles to keep his balance as his log floats into the
viver -- kicking his legs as it spins

Henry KICKS tree after tree Abe leaps from trunk to trunk
He careens back and forth losing it until

Re SPLASHES into the river -- a tree trunk KNOCKS hard into
his head sending him under the water

CUT TO
A MONTAGE

Of Abe improving learning as the seasons change -- coming
into his own as a vampire hunter

-- Abe and Henry face off like gladiators in the center of
the clearing all kinds of training equipment surround them

ABE (V0)
Over the next six months Henry
imparted six lifetimes worth of
vampire secretstheir abilities

HENRY
New vampires are prisoners of the
night But after a century of gradual
exposure they can tolerate the sun in
limited amounts

-- Henry poses in a display of Asian-influenced battle
stances Abe does his best to mimic his form and control

ABE (V0)
Their methods

HENRY
Vampires often lure their prey in with
merriment and drink -- for the happier

the victim at the moment of death the
more enriching empowering his
blood

-- Abe and Henry sit in meditation poses eyes closed -- the
whole of St Louis and the river below them

ABE (VO)
And their weaknesses

HENRY
(peacefully)
When Judas betrayed Jesus what was
his reward

ABE
You know this would be much easier if
you didnt talk

-- A RAGING fire We WIDEN TO REVEAL Henry wearing an apron
and heavy leather gloves tending the small caldron in the
flames Abe is beside him holding his ax

HENRY
The answer of course is thirty
pieces of silver

ABE
I knew that

Henry pulls the cauldron out of the flames -- a gallon of
molten silver inside As he pours some of it into a small
iron mold

HENRY
At that moment those pieces became a
symbol of betraying God Of evil At
that moment - silver became a curse
upon the cursed You will never see a
vampire with silver on his person --
nor see them reflected in mirrors

ABE
(astonished)
Because mirrors are made of

HENRY
Silver Abraham

Henry PLUNGES the mold into a bucket of water Steam HISSES
for a moment then stops He opens the mold and hands Abe --

A SILVER BULLET
perfectly formed gleaming and unique

HENRY (CONTD)
The one thing God has placed beyond
the vampires reach The one thing he
can never possess and the only thing
that renders him powerless

As Abe studies his bullet Henry takes Abes ax and dips the
head into the molten silver coating it

-- Henry continues Abes teaching as they battle each other --
Abes Kung Fu better than ever

HENRY (CONTD)
Some will keep their victims on the
brink of death for days -- even weeks
on end draining them slowly It is a
means of causing needless suffering
Better vampires frown upon it

ABE
Better As in good vampires

CUT TO
EXT HENRYS HOUSE (PARLOR) — NIGHT

Henry has an ancient Medieval book open -- its every detail
hand-drawn centuries ago Spanning two pages an ornate --

ILLUSTRATION

depicts two groups of vampires On one side human-looking
creatures huddie in the darkness -- sharing the blood of a
grown man On the other a group of demonic vampires has
overrun a village -- pulling families from their homes
children from their beds

HENRY
There are those vampires who follow
the code -- who drink only what they

need who dont prey upon children
Henry points to the other darker side of the picture

HENRY (CONT’D)
But there are others -- those who kill
for pleasure who see themselves as
gods as wolves in a world of sheep

Henry points to the illustrated demon hovering above the
others -- clearly their leader

HENRY (CONT’D)
(a dark beat)
The figlio del diavolo

ABE
The what

HENRY

The oldest most powerful of his kind
Its said he believes vampires to be
the chosen inheritors of the earth
that hes on a righteous quest to free
them from the shadows

(beat)

They call him Adam He from who all
others were born

On Adams frightful illustrated face we --
INT HENRYS HOUSE (ABES ROOM) - NIGHT

Abe writes in his journal by candlelight covered by a sheet
in bed He hears Henry DESCENDING the stairs

ABE (VO)
Night after night Henry went
huntingnever permitting me to join
him ordering me to stay in my room
till morning I liked my roombut
Ive never been worth a damn at
following orders

When he hears the door SHUT Abe throws off the sheet --
fully dressed beneath it

CUT TO

EXT A CITY ALLEY — NIGHT
A prostitute (the one we met in Henrys tub) stumbles into
the alley laughing with her MALE COMPANION She pushes him
against the wall as --
A DARK FIGURE
creeps along the rooftop above
PROSTITUTE
Not too rough now -- IT have a devil

of a toothache

She kneels out of sight For a moment the man is transported
by pleasure -- his eyes closed When they open theres --

A DEMON
hanging upside-down in front of his face

He disappears before he can scream Blood rains down and a
limp body falls back into the alley with a sickening THUD

HENRY

in his vampire form -- jumps down into the alley reaches
into his coat and hands the girl a few bills

She kisses his cheek and hurries off Henry sinks his fangs
into the mans neck drinkingquieting the hunger at last
until --

ABE (0S
So

Henry drops his prey and spins around ready to fight -- but
stops when he sees --

ABE
standing at the mouth of the alley holding his ax

ABE (CONTD)
This is why you always eat alone

Henry wipes his chin his vampire face fading away as Abe
tries to hide his horror at what he sees

ABE (CONT’D)
you lied to me Henry

HENRY
You werent ready to know

ABE
Ready to know what -- that youre a
vampire

HENRY

Who feeds only on the wicked

ABE
(the corpse)
And what wickedness was he guilty of --
having the misfortune of walking into
your trap

HENRY
If I told you the things that man hed
done the crimes hed committed --
youd have killed him yourself

ABE
So youre his self-appointed judge
His executioner

HENRY
Im on the right side Abraham

Abe eyes Henry with disgust -- the last six months flashing
before him Ali of it a wasteall of it a lie

ABE

Im here to hunt vampires Henry --
not partner with them

Abe turns and walks away until --
HENRY
Youre not the only one who lost
everything to vampires
Abe keeps walking
HENRY (CONTD)
You asked me about the woman in the

paintings

Now he stops Simple curiosity at first

HENRY (CONTD)
Shes my reason The one whose memory
I honor

FLASH TO
EXT A WOODED ROAD -— 1680 - (FLASHBACK) - DUSK

Even though its over 150 years ago Henry looks exactly the
same -- only more vibrant more alive He walks hand-in-hand
with his very-pregnant WIFE

HENRY (VO)
Id heard the stories the myths like
everyone else And like everyone else
I paid them no mind

-- They come upon a carriage with a broken wheel -- a lone
MAN struggling to repair it his back turned

HENRY (V0O) (CONTD)
And so when I saw a stranger in need
I did what any Christian would have

-- When Henry offers to help the man spins around and bears
his fangs (though we still dont see the rest of his face)

-- Running for their lives through the woods chased by a
demon -- its face blurred by the horror of the memory

-- Henry pulling his wife along but shes too slow As
theyre overtaken -- SMASHED against the tree trunks

HENRY (CONTD)
He took everything I had

-- Henry reaches out to his wife as they both lie bloodied on
the ground -- her BREATHING shallow labored

-- The vampire cuts his own wrist with a clawed finger and
forces Henry to drink the blood that gushes forth

HENRY (VO) (CONTD)
And cursed me to live with my grief
for ali eternity

-- Henry lies on the cold earth SCREAMING -- his body
undergoing the vampire transformation

BACK TO

Abes been softened by the horror of Henrys story

HENRY (CONTD)
Ive spent my death hunting those who
kill without conscience Through the
centuries Ive searched for others to
help me Trained them to hunt as I do

ABE
There are others like me

HENRY
A handful -- enough to keep the
balance between the living world and
the dead to keep vampires in the
darkness By day were bankers
politicians farmers By nightwere
the silent guardians of Man

Abe reacts Its a lot to take in
HENRY (CONTD)
I deserve hell as all vampires do
But Id like to do some good before I
go -- and Id like you to help me
Abe considers A pregnant BEAT
ABE
I hope you wont take it personally if
I start locking my door at night

CUT TO
EXT ON THE RIVER - LATER

Abe and Henry walk home along the river -- the moon reflected
in its undisturbed surface

HENRY
Absurd What reason would I have to
kill you

ABE

Lets seeyoure a vampire

HENRY
And so the rest is written Have I not
the mind of a man The same needs To
be clothed and fed and entertained

mAh

ADL
Its the fed part Im concerned
with

HENRY

Well you neednt worry Abraham Some
men are just too interesting to
kill

Henry stops cold He hears something we cant hear Senses
something He grabs Abe and holds him down

They huddle in silence A series of SPLASHES up ahead as --
THREE RUNAWAY SLAVES

leap neadlong into the water and swim hurriedly across --
toward the far bank

HENRY (CONTD)
(whispered instructive)
There Do you see it

ABE
See what

HENRY
What they run from

But Abe scans the dark shorelinenothing Then he looks up
into the trees and sees the outline of --

A STALKING VAMPIRE

crouching on an overhanging branch like a vulture Abe looks
to the slaves whove reached the far shore

The VAMPIRE LEAPS -- launching himself from the trees and
over the river It flies through the air and LANDS squarely
on one of its prey Abe lifts his axe and starts toward the

water -- but Henry grabs him pins him roughly
ABE
(struggling)
We have to help them
HENRY
Were assassins Abraham -- not

saviors Rule number four leave no
witnesses to your work living or
dead

The SCREAMS of slaves pierce the night Fuck it

ABE
My father told me to look away
(beat)
I didnt listen to him either

Abe STRIKES Henry with the blunt side of his ax freeing
himself He hurries toward the waters edge but Henry is
guick to recover and tackle him

Teacher and student fight -- Abe SHATTERING trees with his
ax Henry KICKING with enough force to kill five lesser men

All of Abes skills are evident his quickness his strength
his balance Together with his silver ax hes a force to be
reckoned with

So much so that he turns the tables -- pinning Henry raising
his ax and -—-

HENRY
(uncle)
ENOUGH

They stop A long BEAT -- the SCREAMS of the slaves no longer
heard Despite everything Henry lookspleased

He sits up

HENRY (CONTD)

I can see a mans purpose Abraham I
can see it as clearly as I see you
before me now Yours is and has
always been to fight tyranny From
this moment on mine shall be to see
that you succeed Ive given you the
whole of my knowledge on hunting and
destroying vampires

Abe rounds a corner on horseback taking care not to collide
with a CARRIAGE as it passes

ABE (VO)

life that would complement my secret
one Something interesting -- a
lawyer perhaps

A BOOK

Protrudes from his saddlebag On the Laws of England As Abe
navigates his horse through the market we PULL BACK TO
REVEAL the street in all its bustling glory

ABE (VO) (CONTD)

SPEED (CONT’D)

Speed punches the poor sap in the back of the head as he

ABE

Abe SNATCHES the list from Speed

ABE
Good day

SPEED

Abe stops
SPEED (CONT’D)

There’s a room upstairs It isn’t

It’s clearly an offer he can’t refuse
INT THE ROOM ABOVE SPEEDS STORE - NIGHT
Abe sits at a small desk writing a letter by candlelight

until a POST RIDER enters thumbing through a handful of mail

POST RIDER

As Abe reaches into his pocket for a coin to pay him with he
reads the return addressH Sturges

Hiding the envelope from the others Abe opens it hurriedly

HENRY (V0)

Abe pulls out the ax that had been concealed beneath his
coat He swings his targets neck but Barts is able to duck
beneath the blade

He vamps out and counterattacks -- grabbing Abes coat and
SMASHING him into the opposite wail

Abe slinks to the floor stunned

BARTS (CONTD)
And what of the things you took from

Barts takes off his eye patch and drops it on the floor
revealing the unforgettable bullet eye beneath Emphasizing
each word with a brutal kick to Abes midsection

Abe sweeps Bartss feet from under him reaches into his coat
and drives a stake through his heart

Barts clutches it confusion on his face as dark blood begins
to pour from his mouth and nostrils His lips opening and
closing -- a fish trying to draw breath

His good eye fearful -- looking at Abe who rises to his
full intimidating height

He raises his ax -- considers beheading him Instead he
lowers the blade and just stares at what hes done

ABE (VO)

even a measure of peace But I felt
nothing Only the wish that hed
suffered more Only the need to
destroy another

DOUGLAS (CONTD)
Well I say ENOUGH I say the need for
peace outweighs the needs of the
Negro I say if the people of Illinois

Democrats ROAR their approval Abe stands as --

ABE
Gentlemen when I hear men like Mr
Douglas arguing for slavery I feel a
strong impulse to see it tried on them

personally -- though at his height Im
not sure hed make much of a field

Fellow Whigs LAUGH and CLAP their approval

ABE (CONTD)

As a nation we began by declaring
all men are created equal We now
practically read it ali men are
created equal except Negroes And
where does it end Shall we say the
same of foreigners Catholics

(beat)
Gentlemen we vainly imagine that this
country was built by superior wisdom
and virtue But it was built with
their labor Their blood

DOUGLAS
Mr Lincoln -- are you saying you
would rather defend the rights of
blacks and vagrants than see an end to
this violence

A HUSH falls over the room
ABE
Mr Douglas Im saying that until
every man is free were all slaves

He motions to the side of the platform where --

WILL

ABE (VO)
The theater of it alimen women
children -- inspected and prodded as

As the auctioneer pries his mouth open showing off his
teeth Will spots Abe in the crowd His eyes go wide but --

-- Abe is quick to gesture Shhhhh

of orange sky glittering off their shackled bare feet

SLAVES
(singing)
Who those children dressed in Red
God’s gonna trouble the water Must be
the ones that Moses led God’s gonna
trouble the water

The grey-whiskered master rides point on horseback while an
OVERSEER brings up the rear -- a rifle across his saddle

EXT A GRAND PLANTATION HOUSE — DUSK

The slaves are led toward the plantations grand main house
dread on their faces But as we GROW CLOSER

Lamp light and MUSIC pour from its every window There seems
to be a party going on inside

A GRAND BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Filled with festivity scores of FELLOW SLAVES clad in fine
silk dancing with WHITE MEN AND WOMEN in equally-fine
attire Marble crystal and gold -- ruled by a breathtaking
staircase that would be at home in the Paris Opera House
SLAVE MUSICIANS

in tuxedos play an up-tempo WALTZ in the corner

The new arrivals are marched past a long elegantly-set table
covered in food sweets and spirits

Have we died and gone to some kind of slave Heaven
The newly-arrived slaves are taken in hand by white dance

partners and led to the center of the ballroom floor As they
begin to dance

OUTSIDE - SAME

Abe and Speed lurk near a horse corral the occasional WHINNY
or SNORT as they watch through the ballrooms tall windows --
completely baffled by what they see

BUTLER (0S)
Mr Lincoln

Startled Abe and Speed turn and find themselves a few feet
from --

AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN BUTLER

decked out in a tuxedo and white gloves Behind him -- TEN
MEAN-LOOKING WHITE MEN

ABE
Howd you know my -

BUTLER
Would you be kind nuff to join us
inside sir

Abe and Speed share a look -- quizzical
SPEED
(terrified)
You uh -- you go ahead Im good
right here

IN THE BALLROOM -— MOMENTS LATER

Abe is led into the ballroom as the slaves (including Will)
dance Hes confused but cautious hyper-aware

The Butler motions for Abe to sit at the elegantly-decorated
table Abe does as hes told

A BEAT as Abe watches the slaves glide around him with their
dance partners Easily the strangest thing hes ever seen

As if on cue down the staircase comes the most resplendent
figure of all an older dashing man of timeless elegance

The very picture of the Southern Gentleman -- flanked by a

personal guard of VAMPIRES We could easily call him Rhett
Butler

but well call him ADAM instead

ADAM
(walkingAbe)
Im so pleased you accepted my
invitation My apologies for the
theatrics but I needed something that
would convince you to come all this --

ABE
What do you want

Adam takes a seat directly across from Abe A BEAT then --

ADAM
To give you a choice Mr Lincoln --
something Henry never has

Abe tries to hide his surprise at hearing Henrys name

ADAM (CONTD)
Ill give him this -- he has an eye
for talent Youve proven quite
effective at destroying our kind
(beat)
Tell me has he ever lied to you

Abe tries to hide this reaction too

ADAM (CONTD)
Have you ever wondered why he sends
you after the vampires he does Ever
wondered if its Henry whos hungry
for power Or are you Mr Lincoln
merely a slave with a vampire for his
master

ABE
more forceful)
What do you WANT

ADAM
To see you liberate yourself use your
gifts for something greaterto see
you destroy your oppressor

(beat)
Or shall I destroy your friend
instead
Abe glances at Will then runs his fingers over the --

AX

hidden beneath his coat preparing to strike

ADAM (CONTD)
A simple yes or no will suffice

Now or never Abe tries to lunge at Adam but hes restrained
from behind by two vampires As he struggles --

ADAM (CONTD)
Ill take that as a no

Adam raises a gloved hand in the air fingers spread as the
slaves dance with their partners -- the world twirling
beautifully by

ABE
(struggling)
You cant do this

Adam closes his fist Around the room -- eyes go black
glassy hollow fangs descend

A slave woman’s eyes bulge as fangs CRUNCH through the skin
of her neck sending a shower of blood to the rafters

An OLDER MALE has his head twisted around chin-to-spine --
his body convulsing as a vampire tears into his Adam’s apple

Will SCREAMS as the vampire squeezes his throat trying to
bite

ABE (CONTD)
NOOOOO 1

In one swift motion Abe kicks his chair backward and flips
over the vampires behind him —-

Flipping in SLOW MOTION over their heads -- reaching into his
coat and grabbing his ax at the same time

Three of the chairs legs land on the marble floor -- the
forth goes through the heart of a vampire who was unlucky
enough to be standing directly behind him

Abe rises to his full height and lets his ax fly

ONBOARD THE AX HEAD

as it sails gracefully end over end We’re passengers on the
Ferris wheel of a rotating blade -- the world spinning before
our eyes floor ceiling floor ceiling until --

The vampire behind Will suddenly -- WHOOSH THUMP -- falls
backward with an ax where his face used to be as Will drops
to the floor unconscious

THE SLAVE MUSTCTANS

stop playing This wasnt part of the plan But one CELLIST
eeps going -- his SOLO providing the SCORE for the fight

Abe is the conductor in a Waltz of Death -- gracefully
cutting down a ballroom full of vampiresbeheading them to
the BEAT of the music

Heads and limbs twirling though the air in beautiful SLOW
OTION

When the other musicians see that Abe is winning -- they join
in playing with gusto The waltz builds in intensity along
with Abes fight reaching its CRESCENDO as --

Abe destroys anotherand anotherand another -- until
only one remains

ADAM
stands alone in the center of the ballroom APPLAUDING

ADAM
Bravo Mr Lincoln Youre even better
than Id heard

ABE
(breathing hardintense)
You havent heard the half of it

Abe lunges at him with his ax as the slaves music grows
even more intense

Abe kicks and spins and swings his blade Theres clearly a
difference in Adams skill and power compared to the others
He may look older but hes on another level -- fighting with
a superheros strength and a Kung Fu masters quickness

SPEED

peeks through the window scared half to death but
absolutely riveted by the action

Abe and Adam beating each other senseless -- Rocky and Apollo
in the tenth round The superhuman pounding (face

kidneys) starts to take its toll on Abe until Adam kicks
his ax away and corners him by the long table

ADAM
(not even sweating)
Sure you dont want to reconsider
Abe throws another look to --

WILL

whos starting to come around struggling to lift himself off
the floor

Abe looks down at the table below and sees --
SILVERWARE

neatly laid out Silver He reaches for the knife but Adam
kicks it away

Abe grabs the fork and stabs Adam with it -- burning his
flesh as it punctures his skin

With Adam momentarily stunned Abe launches into a full-on
fork attack Stabbing his enemy again and again

With the pain too much to bear Adam decides to fight another
day He runs toward -

OUTSIDE - SAME
Speed watches Adam BURST through the double doors and leap
impossibly through the air -- into the horse corral and onto

a horses back

ADAM
YA

He gallops through the corral fence -- SHATTERING it and
releasing a herd of spooked horses

Speeds attention turns from Adam to --
ABE

running out the front door with an unconscious Will in his
arms Abe sees Adam racing off on horseback He turns back to
Speed and --

ABE
Take him Speed Take him and get
outve here

SPEED
(in awe of Lincoln)
Who the hell are you

No time to explain Abe hops the fence into the corral
mounts a horse and --

SMASH TO
EXT THE OPEN PLAINS - MOMENTS LATER

We’re racing along a stampede flying over Adams horse as he
kicks its side again and again -- faster

Adam digs his heels in but it’s no use -- Abes halfway to
him now riding reckless

Riding along a cliff face now (the horses are too spooked to
care that theyre dangerously close to plunging to their
deaths)

Abe pulls his horse alongside stands --

And jumps He hooks Adam around the neck -- the two wrestling
on horseback as the earth speeds by beneath them Abe drags
Adam from his saddle sending them both tumbling onto the
ground

Horses GALLOPING past them on all sides -- both Abe and Adam
dodging left and right as if theyre standing in the middle
of a ten-lane freeway while cars race past them

Adam starts to run with the horses -- using his vampire speed
to his advantage Like a Parkour master he jumps off the
side of one horse onto another springing himself onto a
third horses back

Abe grabs a passing horse by the neck and flips himself onto
its back The chase is on -- but Abe has fallen behind
Theres only one way to catch up

Abe jumps from moving horse to moving horse Leapfrogging
using his highly-tuned balance to close the gap between he
and Adam But theres a --
TL

WIDE RAVINE

coming up fast -- a drop to certain death Adam digs his heel
into the horses flank headed for the edge What the hell is
he doing

Adam rides his horse right over the side As the horse falls
into the ravine Adam springs off of its back -- jumping the
rest of the way across the ravine and landing -- BOOM --
safely on the other side

Abe rides even harder -- determined to follow Adam across --
but Abes horse knows better

As it approaches the edge the horse rears back -- its hooves
SKIDDING to a stop and throwing Abe over its head

Abe hits the ground -- THUD -- and rolls toward the drop --
clawing at the dirt to slow himself

falling over the side

and hanging on for dear life by one hand His feet
dangling over certain death

With the last of his strength Abe pulls himself up gets to
his feet

A BEAT
He and Adam share a distant stare across the ravine

I thought they were just stories

Our mission is maintaining balance
I told you -- were assassins not
saviors

ABE
And for every errand you send me on
every vampire I destroy -- twenty
spring up in their place Why not salt
their fields Ensure that their evil
never takes root in America again

Calmly Henry takes Abes full dinner plate and throws it --
SMASH -- into the fireplace

ABE (CONTD)
What the hell was that for

HENRY
What if I told you that was the last
meal you would ever have What if I
used all my powers to keep you there
in your seat as hunger slowly ate at
you How long until you decided to
strike at me Behead me

Abe stands up and begins to walk away

HENRY (CONT’D)

(as Abe leaves)
A good man will do terrible things if
you starve him long enough Imagine
what a vampire would do

If you threaten their way of life if
you provoke themyoull be provoking

consequences with it both for you and
thousands -- perhaps millions of
others

ABE
They provoked it Henry They provoked
it by coming here in the first place

Henry throws up his arms in frustration

Abe tries to cradle her as she weeps She POUNDS him with her
fists -- fights him off But he persists until she collapses
into his grasp her body shaking through the tears

Henry steps behind Abe puts a hand on his shoulder

HENRY

ABE (CONTD)
The fact is youre the only one I can
trust anymore Mary This isnt just

Fine but silver

ABE
Why not Its the one thing they cant
defend against Well make silver

SPEED

silver

ABE

Let me worry about that

A MONTAGE
Of silver being collected and processed

-- SCLDIERS leaving upscale houses with canvas bags of
confiscated items ANGRY RESIDENTS following them onto the
street shouting their displeasure

massive chimney belching smoke

-- Abe meeting privately with Mary in the residence
explaining his plan When hes finished

MARY
You want me to do what

-- Mary meeting with an astonished BLACK WOMAN in her modest

home She has a distinct look -- a face well remember As
Mary sits with her - pitching her an idea

deep orange glow of molten silver Jewelry teapots even
forks and knives being melted down and poured into molds

WILL
Evacuate Washington

GENERAL

disaster I dont think the army will

EXT RATL DEPOT - NIGHT

Abe stands with Will and Speed before the giant steel door of
a long building UNION SOLDIERS stand ready for his command

From inside -- beyond the doors -- we hear a massive HISS OF
SMOKE and a heavy powerful mechanical GRUMBLING

ABE
Well menif this doesnt work Ill
see you in Paris

Abe signals the Soldiers who release a series of pulleys —-
slowly opening the gigantic door and revealing --

A GLEAMING STEAM TRAIN

Being loaded with cargo -- STEAM hissing from its brakes as
it lies dormant

ABE (CONT D)
Weve only collected a fraction of the
siiver Id hoped but itll have to
do

As Will and Speed marvel at it --
ABE (CONT’ D)
Gettysburg friendsGettysburg shall
decide whether this world belongs to

the Living or the dead

The magnificent train BELLOWS powerfully behind Abe as he
casts a distant glance down the track -- to the final battle

INT WHITE HOUSE (EXECUTIVE OFFICE) - EVENING
Abe stands in front of the FIREPLACE winding an old clock
that sits on the mantle He checks his silver pocket watch

for reference until --

HENRY (0S)
Youve doomed us

Abe looks in the watchs mirror and sees --
HENRYS CLOTHES

seated by themselves in a dark corner a whisky bottle
floating in mid-air

HENRY (CONT’D)
You and your ideologyyour
Emancipation

Abe turns around and finds the real Henry -- shit-faced in a
way we havent seen before

HENRY (CONT’D)
And now your train Youve upset the
balance Ive worked centuries to
preserve and you dont even trust me
enough to summon me wnen enacting your
secret plan

ABE
Youre one to speak of balance Look
at you -- a drunken mess

HENRY

(suddenly enraged)
You insult me After all Ive given
you You may be my best student
Abraham -- but youre still my
student

An odd statement coming from someone who at this point
looks young enough to be the 52-year-old Presidents son

ABE
The whole of my lifes been spent on
your errands Your enemies And to
what end To what happiness of my own

HENRY
You speak as if youve lived the years
Ive lived Seen the things Ive seen
Youre an infant I lost a life to
vampires A chance at salvation

ABE
And I lost a son Henry A mother But
T endure I fight What do you do Cry
into a bottle Cradle whores with one
arm while painting your beloved wife
with the other

Henry vamps out and clutches Abe by the throat SLAMMING him
against the mantle

HENRY
YOU DARE SPEAK OF HER

Henry grabs him and presses his fangs to his neck -- hard
enough to draw blood

But Henry releases him -- just as Speed and Will rush in
drawn by the commotion Confronted by the sight of Abe in
Henrys clutches both draw their weapons

WILL
Get away from him

HENRY
(a beat to Abe)
Ive tried to keep it from this But
youve ruined it

Abe is suddenly struck by a chilling thought

ABE
Youve been there for all of itthe
secret meetingsthe generals

Abe is struck by the full weight of the realizationhis
whole world collapsing

ABE (CONT’ D)
You Youre the reason they know what
were going to do at every turn
Youre the one whos telling them

HENRY
(sinister)
You have no idea Abraham

Abe turns and grabs the ax mounted over his mantle but when
he turns back -- Henry is gone Speed and Will stare back at
him blankly

ABE
(a beat then)
If he knows about our plan then they
do We have to get on that train and
protect it

Adam is surround by a group of VAMPIRES as he looks out at

the seemingly endless Union Camp in the distance It looks
like hundreds of tiny campfires covering the earth in stars

ADAM
This war ends tonight Come friends --
we have a train to catch

QUICK CUTS
Of Abe Speed and Will chasing the train on horseback

INTERCUT with Adam and his companions doing the same -- the
tension building as we wonder who will reach it first

CUT TO
EXT HIGH ABOVE A TRAIN - NIGHT
As it CHUGS along a moonlit wooded mountainside
UNTON GUARDS are posted up and down its length -- some

stationed in the boxcars others in the spaces between them
Everything about this rolling fortress says stay away

IN A BOXCAR - SAME

MOVING THROUGH the cargo -- tightly-packed crates and boxes
(we can safely assume theyre full of silver weapons and
ammo)

Two GUARDS share a smoke in this car rifles slung

GUARD 1
First they keep us waiting in a train
yard for two weeks then they issue us
silver bulletsChrist its no
wonder were losing this war

GUARD 2
Can you keep a secret

I melted all mine down sold tem Lead
shoots just as straight as silver

Their conversation is interrupted by a THUD that SHAKES the
entire car side to side

GUARD 2 (CONTD)
What the --

Another THUD They grab their rifles as --

HIGH ABOVE THE TRAIN - SAME

As if theyve been waiting for us DOZENS OF VAMPIRES descend
from the treetops high above -- some falling hundreds of feet
onto the roofs below Each —- THUD -- SHAKING the cars

IN THE STEAM ENGINE - SAME

The trains ENGINEER is joined by a UNION COLONEL in the glow
of the furnace When a THUD rattles the train behind them --

ENGINEER
Holy SHIT

He reaches for the brake but the colonel grabs his hand

COLONEL
I have my orders We stop for nothing

Theyre both too distracted to notice --

THE VAMPIRE

snaking silently over the coal car behind them
ABOVE THE TRAIN - SAME

Vampires creep spider-like along the tops of cars silently
killing guards as they move forward

IN A BOXCAR - SAME

FLYING ALONG THE TRAIN - SAME

Their GUNSHOTS alert the others GUARDS go on high alert up
and down the train -- readying their weapons

IN THE LOCOMOTIVE - MOMENTS LATER

The Engineer and Colonel are extremely dead the cab soaked
with their blood The Vampire grabs the brakethrottle lever
and SNAPS it off

BEHIND THE TRAIN -- SAME

From out of the night come three HORSEMEN -- an all-out
gallop as they ride onto the tracks At first we think its
Abe Speed and Will

But CLOSER we see Adam -- joined by two VAMPIRE RIDERS

AS they race toward the back of the train closing in --

THE CABOOSES REAR DOOR

suddenly FLINGS open and streaking MACHINE GUN FIRE comes
shooting out of it

ABE

aims a Gatling Gun mounted to the rear while Will cranks the
handie that turns its barrel

One of Adams escorts is hit -- the bullet entering then
searing his flesh as he falls off his horse and onto the
tracks Adam and the other rider peel off into the night --
gone for now

ON TOP OF THE TRAIN -- MOMENTS LATER

Abe Speed and Will scale a ladder and begin to fight their
way forward -- the smoke from the locomotive making it
difficult to see at times

-- Wills cigar never moves as he wields dual revolvers with
athletic grace -- firing silver bullets into the foreheads of
the damned then watching them die excruciating deaths as
their brains melt in their heads

-- Abe uses every tool in his arsenal fighting off two and
three vampires at a time blinding them with flares using
Kung Fu in close-quarters both ends of his ax

-- The Union soldiers who havent been torn to shreds either
jump off the train in fear or get thrown off by vampires

-- The dozen who first attacked are whittled down to --

ONE LAST VAMPIRE
who grabs Abe and puts him in a headlock -- fangs out

Its about to bite when -- BANG -- its neck snaps backward
and it falls off the train Dead Abe looks up at --

WILL
a few feet away smoking pistol in hand
ABE
(feeling his throat)

You saved my life

WILL
Once more and were even

As Abe and Will share a smile --
A GUNSHOT rings out
Wills expression changes ever so slightly

ABE
Will

Will looks down at his belly as blood begins to pool on his
shirt -- drops to his knees Abe turns and finds himself
staring down the barrel of --

SPEEDS PISTOL

trembling heid by his old friend -- whos clearly torn about
what hes doing

ABE (CONTD)
Speed

Will (on his knees shaking) looks down at his revolver --
all six chambers are empty

ABE (CONTD)
Speed what are you doing

SPEED
Im sorry Lincoln I never wanted it
to come to this

As it all begins to come together

ABE
How did they get you to betray your
closest friends Huh What was your
price

SPEED
They offered me a chance at a life
after you lose this war
(beat)
That and half the silver aboard

Abe almost smiles at the obvious

ABE
And into the hands of Judas were
placed thirty coins of silver

SPEED
Lincoln II never wanted them to
hurt your boy
(breaking)
Im sorry

THE WORLD SLOWS as Will leaps to his feet and Speed pulls the
trigger -- the gun pointed at Abe

THE BULLET

leaves Speeds barrel flying toward the President as Will
dives in front of Abe The bullet strikes Will in the chest
as he flies through the air and falls off the side of the
train

Gone

ABE
WIIIILLL

Before Speed can fire again Abe flips his ax around and
SHOOTS him the force sending Speed off his feet and onto the
tracks

And just like that his two oldest closest friends in the
world are gone

ON THE TRACKS - SAME
The bodies of Speed and Will have come to rest near each

other on the tracks -- looking at each other with their
lifeless open eyes
94

ON TOP OF THE TRAIN (MOVING) - SAME
Theres no time for Abes shock -- not yet He senses a
strange light growling behind him He turns facing front as

the train rounds a corner and sees --

A BURNING RAIL BRIDGE

in the distance -- a bridge that spans a huge drop to the
rushing waters of a river below Suddenly it all comes
together Abe runs forward -- intent on stopping the train

before it plummets to its doom
CUT TO
IN THE STEAM ENGINE - MOMENTS LATER

Abe reaches the engine with every intent of stopping the
train but finds --

ADAM

instead -- beheld in all his dark glory dashing relaxed and
sitting at the controls as the train races toward the end

ADAM
Its true what they sayif you want
something done right

Adam leaps at him -- an impossible leap that knocks Abe onto
the pile of coal behind the locomotive

Abe springs to his feet and fights back with the ax -- the
worlds most-powerful vampire against the worlds most
powerful vampire hunter

But Abe is older slower than when they last met -- and Adam
is quite frankly kicking his ass down the length of the
train Abe can barely stand his ground

Before the fight has really even begun Abe finds himself on
his back -- Adam holding his ax with one hand and holding
Abe over the side of a boxcar with the other -- pressing his
head closer to the tracks racing by below

Adam squeezes his throat As Abe GASPS for air -- his face
about to be ripped off --

ADAM (CONTT’ D)
Its a shame Mr Lincolnyou
couldve led a peaceful life if youd
simply done as I asked If youd
simply been my errand boy instead of
his Ill just have to wait for
another gifted human to come along and
destroy him for me

Abes cheek is almost scraping the ground

ABE
(struggling)
I thought youbelieved in doing
thingsyourself

Adam LAUGHS then --

ADAM
My God didnt Henry ever tell you
(beat)
Vampires cant kill vampires

HENRY (OS)
No
HENRY STURGES
stands in the boxcar above -- heroic

HENRY (CONTD)
But they can beat the shit out of
them

Henry vamps out and yanks Adam backward -- taking Abe along
for the ride Abe is tossed aside as the vampires begin a
physics-defying Battle Royale

HENRY (CONTD)
(fighting)
Go Abraham Stop the train

Abe snaps to it -- picking up his ax and racing forward as
Henry and Adam fight -- two super beings who cant kill each
other

Henry sends Adam CRASHING through the trains roof and into a
boxcar

HENRY (CONT’D)
You took her from meyou took
everything from me Youyou made me
this You made me a monster
As Adam pushes Henry off --
INTERCUT WITH
IN THE LOCOMOTIVE -— MOMENTS LATER

Abe reaches the engine but finds the brakethrottle lever
snapped off -- the bridge racing towards him in a hurry

Meanwhile Henry and Adam battle it out inside the boxcar --
their ferocity and power SHREDDING it around them

ADAM
(fighting)
IT made you a god

HENRY
300 years Ive suffered

ADAM
Ive waited millennia to bring our
kind into the light

Adams superior power is taking its toll on Henry despite
his rage

Back in the locomotive Abe sticks his ax into the broken
brakethrottle -- trying desperately to control the train

But when he sees the burning bridge give way and the track
fall into the river below Abe realizes its too late

He has no choice but to jump off the side of the train as the
engine plummets over the edge

Adam hangs on as the entire boxcar tilts to one side and --
A CRATE OF BAYONETS

shoots open -- launching its contents through the air with
lethal speed and pinning him to the wall

Adam SCREAMS - crucified by a dozen gleaming blades

But Henry is still trapped with him in a plummeting train --
the wreckage closing in around him
97

ABE

lifts his head out of the dirt just in time to watch the last
of the train disappear over the side

Abe stands disheartened as the wreckage tumbles into the
depths taking the rest of the bridge with it

He looks down as the last of the train sinks into the depths
far below his feet -- gone forever

If theres ever been a BEAT of silent despairthis is it

Abes attention turns to something small flying toward him
from the wreckage -- leaping up from the fiery depths in a
single bound and THUMPING down on two feet in front of him

ADAM

his body is riddled with already-healing wounds A single
gleaming bayonet still sticking out of his belly

and Abes ax in his grasp
As he pulls the bayonet out - black blood dripping off

ADAM (CONT’D)
Youve lost Mr Lincoln Your silver
will never reach Gettysburg

No more time to chat -- Adam raises Abes ax and brings it
down on his head As he does Abe falls onto his back --
catching the handle and stopping the silver blade just above
his face

ABE
(pushing back
Ask yourselfif that bayonet is
silver why arent you dead

As puzzlement spreads over Adams face Abe pulls the
handles hidden trigger and -- BOOM -- blows his head clean
off

The headless body falls to its knees A BEAT as Abe gets to
his feet taking in the sight

HENRY (0S)
He was right

Abe turns and finds --

to see their destruction hurtling toward them
