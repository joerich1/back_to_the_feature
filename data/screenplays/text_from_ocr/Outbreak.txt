FADE IN

EXT JUNGLE

HIGH-PITCHED WHINES LOUDER AND LOUDER MORTARS race
through the air and EXPLODE in the distant jungle Sol-
diers -- black white Oriental -- curse and mutter in
French German Australian and American as they reload

COMPUTER KEYS POUND -- the letters leap across the screen

THE MOTABA RIVER VALLEY BELGIAN CONGO (ZAIRE) 1960
THE CAMP OF FORCES LOYAL TO MOISES TSHOMBE - DAY

BLACK MALE NURSE

carrying a bucket of water from the Motaba River rushes
past the Mercenary Army to --

CAMP INFIRMARY

Where he replaces the towel on the forehead of a fever-
ish delirious AUSTRALIAN MERCENARY with a cold new one

AUSTRALIAN MERCENARY
Gimme somethin for the bleedin
pain Cmon mate help me

The Mercenary tries to lift himself out of his stretcher
Cant Hes too weak His skin is yellow and covered
with blisters that look like chicken pox

NURSE
(checking the
soldiers temp)
Hes still over a hundred and
six Why cant we bring it down

The black African army physician DR RASWANI looks on
helpless Suddenly the Australian emits a sharp cry
His eyes roll back and he begins convulsing Before
Raswani can even reach into his bag for medecine the
Mercenary is dead

Raswani and his Nurse stare with horror

The DRONE of a CHOPPER grows LOUDER as a Bell 2180 ap-
pears over the edge of the forest and kicks up a storm of
dust as it lands Raswani and the Nurse run to meet it
In their eyes hope

( )

Two space-suited figures emerge from the chopper their
faces hidden by thick green plexiglass shields The US
flag is emblazoned on the side of their helmets which
also display their ranks The much taller man is a
lieutenant whom well know as McCLINTOCK Through his
visor we can just make out his pock-marked angular
face The shorter pear-shaped man is a CAPTAIN We
cant see his features only the reflection of horn-
rimmed glasses

RASWANI
Have you brought the medicines
CAPTAIN
Soon
RASWANI
Why the hell didnt you bring
them

CUT TO

INFIRMARY

The two space-suited figures follow Dr Raswani past
soldier after soldier infected with the same disease

RASWANI
Thirty deaths yesterday eighteen
the day before the disease is
killing our men faster than enemy
bullets

The Captain stops at a young AMERICAN MERCENARYS cot
Hes shaking with fever His skin is mottled and looks
like the pulp of an orange His voice is a whisper

AMERICAN MERCENARY
Take me home Captain Get me
outta this shithole Please I
wanna see my girl

The American Mercenary reaches out with his arms to the
Captain who shrinks back not wanting to be
contaminated

CAPTAIN
Well get you home soldier
First I need a tissue sample

He pulls from his black bag a long metal syringe and
plunges the biopsy needle deep into the mans liver He
places the needle in an aluminum test tube and seals it

( )

AMERICAN MERCENARY
Promise me youll get me home
Promise me Goddamit

A long uneasy beat

CAPTAIN
Well get you home

CUT TO

TWO SPACE-SUITED US ARMY FIGURES

RASWANI
Not just supplies but doctors

The plane tonight will bring
everything

CUT TO

INSIDE CHOPPER
ascending above the camp

Lt McClintock and the Captain look out the window at the
campsite

McCLINTOCK
Its viral Theres no way to
stop it It could spread all
over the world

We cant see the Captains face but feel his remorse
So can McClintock

McCLINTOCK
If youll excuse my bluntness
sir you cant go halfway on this

CAPTAIN
Dont ever -- ever -- tell me

CUT TO
TSHOMBE CAMPSITE - DUSK

Dr Raswani gives a shot to the American Mercenary who
looks terminal

DR RASWANI

CUT TO

RASWANI

ThE Male Nurse and dozens of soldiers rush across the
forest to the makeshift runway beside the camp In the
distance a camouflaged DC-3 is rapidly approaching

INT DC
The PILOT no more than 21 sees the soldiers celebrating
their arrival down on the runway His hand is on the

green bomb release lever

PILOT
I cant

McClintock is in the copilots seat

McCLINTOCK
Its either them or us

He puts his hand on the green release lever Hesitates
PILOT
You cant either
ON GROUND
Dr Raswani and the soldiers stare at the plane coming
in too high for a landing
INSIDE PLANE
McClintock squeezes the green lever

( )

The bomb cannisters under the wing open up releasing a
thick cloud of yellow cyanide gas

ON GROUND

Screams of agony rip out as Raswani and the soldiers
convulse and die

The plane shoots over the treetops spraying the ground
below like a crop duster

Then the plane arcs and approaches again

OVER RUNWAY

littered with the dead the plane releases a waxy grey
cloud One second Two seconds An eerie stillness

The CLOUD EXPLODES in a huge inferno

The plane releases more and more napalm burning the
jungle for miles

The CRIES of ANIMALS caught in the fire pierce the night
Flames shoot up trees a hundred feet high

PULL BACK to show the whole forest ablaze A long beat
then at the very LEFT CORNER OF the FRAME a MONKEY with
a black and white coat (a Colobos monkey) emerges from
the fire looks back at its mate threatened by the
flames The Colobos jumps up and down baring its teeth
SCREAMING The fire moves relentlessly forward The
monkeys dart to safety

CUT TO

MOTABA RIVER VALLEY - NEXT MORNING

A metal syringe burned to a molten shard lies beside a
mortar launcher twisted and deformed like some bizarre
modern sculpture PULL BACK to reveal acre after acre
mile after mile of nothing but ashes and carcasses of
burnt-out trees Not a single living thing remains

SHOCK CUT TO

ABOVE RAINFOREST

Brilliant streams of orange and purple the last rays of
the setting sun dance across the sky and penetrate the
vapor cloud above the rain forest Unworldly silence
Shattered by

Giant TREES CRASHING to the ground TRACTORS ROAR
CHAINSAWS REV with a penetrating whine Huge trees
living undisturbed for hundreds of years topple to earth
their roots ripped from the soil

REVEAL the army of construction workers clearing a path
for the new road linking Kinshasa with Bangui White
foremen bellow orders in French at their black workers
including

MORAZU a seven-foot tall Goliath with mischievous eyes
He PUNCHES on his CHAIN SAW and RIPS into another tree
A cloud of wood dust envelops him

OVERHEAD - ZAIREAN ARMY HELICOPTERS

ROAR by overhead their machine gunners searching for
guerilla activity

INTERCUT - TWO COLOBOS MONKEYS

a mother and her daughter whom well know as Betsy
Betsy plays with a fat round jackfruit kicking it and
rolling it every which way Her mother watches the
construction workers warily

Morazu hums as he pulls a huge tree limb off the road and
into a thick patch of brush where he comes face to face
with Betsy Morazu smiles He takes a long piece of
sweetened bread from his pocket and lays it down right in
front of the young monkey

Betsy eyes it warily
MORAZU
(softly)
Take it

( )

A long beat Betsy takes the bread examines it careful-
ly finally takes a bite

Morazu grabs her BETSY struggles thrashing and SCREAM-
ING Morazu pins her hands behind her back She spins
around and sinks her teeth into his finger

He lets go with a shriek and swears at Betsy who disap-
pears with the bread

STAY WITH Morazu as he returns to his work He sucks the
blood out of the small wound

CUT TO

EXT MOTABA RIVA VALLEY (AUGUST 15)

Morazu gets off a bus by a small muddy river and walks
slowly toward his village of about fifty mud-thatched
huts Pain in his back makes him wince We see him UP
CLOSE his eyes are red and his skin is pale Hes
sweating

He stops at the village well and takes a drink Other
villagers come up to say hello and Morazu greets them
wearily dipping his cup back in the water for another
drink The villagers drink too

DISCOVER in the background the tribal medicine man the
jJu-ju man Streaks and circles of paint cover his
skin He watches the excitement surrounding Morazus
return

RAIN FOREST - LATER THAT NIGHT

A small group of Colobos monkeys including Betsy and her
mother run swiftly through the forest Suddenly BETSY
CRIES OUT Her foot is snagged in a trap Before her
mother can respond shes pulled high into the air into a
bamboo cage The DOOR SNAPS SHUT BETSY SCREAMS in fear
and pain hanging upside down --

He fishes through it shoving aside old medical books
and equipment He finds an old wood stethoscope with
thick rubber tubing He shoves in into his pocket

organized since you left Robby

Beat Shes surprised at his admission And un-
comfortable Sos he He continues searching through
the box and pulls out

A photo taken during their honeymoon cruise theyre
both smiling radiantly as they hold between them a
trophy of a dancing couple

GILLESPIE
Yknow this is the only evidence
on Earth that I was ever graceful

He checks her reaction There is a hint of a smile

ROBBY
Take it
GILLESPIE
Nah people might see it get

the wrong impression

He drops the photo back in the box and moves toward
the door

completely Without breaking stride he leaps the
four feet onto the plane and slides to a stop right

GILLESPIE
I want to know just one thing

SALT
Im not sure how to assess the
question --

IZZY

-- Just say ‘yes sir Captain
Whatever the Colonel asks you

infection in a human being

SALT

GILLESPIE
Its about as pretty as goin
naked up the middle against the
Dallas Cowboys

( )

SALT
I grew up on the South Side of
Chicago sir Whatever it is
I can handle it

GILLESPIE
I hope so because if you cant
youll make a mistake Youll
be holding a needle and itll
slip Or your glove will have
a crack in it and you wont notice
You work with filoviruses its
like working with plutonium A
single drop of blood can hold
six billion Thats more
filoviruses than there are people
in the world You get a single
one of those inside you youre
infected Say youre lucky and
its one of the few filoviruses
we have antiserum for Then we
can treat you and youll probably
live But say youre unlucky
And you get one of those
filoviruses we dont have an
antiserum for which is most of
them Theres no medicine no
cure nothing we can do to help
you Your body gets so hot your
liver your kidney all your
vital organs melt and your skin
turns into tapioca pudding

flying low over the rain forest The first carries
Gillespie and his crew the second is a gunship flying
escort They pass over the wide Motaba River that
snakes for miles

Izzy flips the switch on Fords respirator which sucks
air out of the atmosphere filters it and pumps it
into the suit Ford starts to swell up like the
Pillsbury doughboy

FORD
And I thought it was a hassle
wearin a tie all day

INT FRONT OF CHOPPER - A LITTLE LATER

Gillespie now suited up in full biosafety gear but
holding his helmet in his hands sits beside the
CHOPPER PILOT In the distance we see a village in

ready to get out as soon as the chopper puts down
Gillespie has to shout at Salt over the sound of the
WHIRLING CHOPPER BLADES

GILLESPIE
Captain Salt if you fail to
observe strict decontamination
protocol three things can happen
First you can be court-martialed
Second you can die from this
horrible disease Third and
worst of all you can incur my
displeasure You got it

SALT
Yes sir

GILLESPIE
If one of us gets sick we all get
sick

(turns to Ford)
And I didnt come here to die

BURNING HUTS - WIDE ANGLE SHOT

juxtaposed against the US Army choppers disgorging
the US Army Infectious Disease Team -- blue space-
suited figures with the US flag emblazoned on their
arms and helmets

The ju-ju man remains high on the cliff above the
village chanting and wailing burning an offering to
the gods

The US Army Team approaches the village through the
smoky haze and we see --

Two different worlds juxtaposed -- men in spacesuits
and a man in a loincloth

Gillespie followed by Berman Salt and Ford moves
across the village which now looks devastated and
deserted except for a few remaining huts and a small
cinder block building with an old Volkswagen van
marked with a red cross parked out front

( )

Ford walks slower taking everything in appalled at
what he sees

The US Army team enters the cinder block hut

INT CINDER BLOCK HUT

A short slender bespectacled black man in his late
forties -- DR IWABI -- head of the Zaire Infectious
Disease Heath Agency -- and his NURSE protected only
by a smock a surgical mask and gloves gives comfort
to a young woman whos dying

GILLESPIE
Doctor Iwabi I brought blood
plasma --

DR IWABI
-- Youre too late

GILLESPIE
I came as soon as I could

DR IWABI
It wouldnt have mattered when you
came This one is different --
worse than Lassa worse even than
Ebola It strikes and kills so
fast The young the healthy
everybody

GILLESPIE
Who was the index case

DR IWABI
A road construction worker

IZZY
How did he get it

DR IWABI
We dont know He died three days
ago
Salt moves ahead to the next bed and pulls aside the
thin mosquito curtain to inspect the patient Ford
is right behind him

SALT
God

( )

The corpses eyes are yellow and his flesh speckled
with hemmorrhages looks like pulp Blood oozes from
his nose and his nipples Ford turns away in horror

SALT
(retches )
Im gonna be sick

He starts to rip off his mask Gillespie grabs his
arms

GILLESPIE
Keep you helmet on Goddamit

SALT
I cant breath

Salt vomits in his helmet Rips it off He rushes

out Izzy moves after him
GILLESPIE
Put him in quarantine Now
DR IWABI
You dont need to
GILLESPIE
Why
DR IWABI

Its not spread in the air

GILLESPIE
How do you know

DR IWABI
(pulls down his mask)
Theres no cough Or wed all be
dead For days weve been working
with only these masks They cant
keep out a particle as small as a
virus

GILLESPIE
Could any infected person have
gotten out of this village and
spread it

DR IWABI
The incubation period is only one
or two days The mortality is one
hundred percent

(MORE )

( )

DR IWABI (CONTD)
If anyone got out they are dead
or will be soon And if they have
spread the disease we will know
rather quickly

GILLESPIE
Finding the host is the only way
to control the spread Our only
hope is that this is like most
viruses and that it has to live in
a host an animal to which its
adapted over thousands of years
And that animal host has developed
antibodies to protect itself
against the virus If we can
identify that animal host and
harvest its antibodies we can use
them to fight the disease in
humans

DR IWABI

There are a hundred thousand
species of animals and insects in
this rain forest The
construction worker could have
been in contact with any one of
them Where do I start

GILLEPSIE
General tell him that our
government will help with money
personnel supplies whatever it
takes

Ford hesitates
FORD
Of course well do whatever we

can

Plumes of black smoke which waft up from the blackened

funeral pyre like a mirage

GILLESPIE
Whats he saying

DR IWABI
Hes asking for forgiveness from
the Gods of the forest Theyre
angry because theyve been awoken
from their sleep by the men
building the road These deaths
are their punishment

look-out for this disease What
the hell is this

GILLESPIE
A safeguard sir

FORD
Are you nuts Within a week well
know if this thing burned itself
out in that village just like
Iwabi said --

GILLESPIE
-- And if Iwabis wrong American
doctors should be warned so cases
can be quarantined Sir this one
is different --

FORD
-- Youre a smart guy Gillespie
but you cant write a memo to the
CDC which says the sky is falling

GILLESPIE
(sharply)
We should do nothing
FORD
Did I say that Colonel

We will monitor the situation in
Africa and if this virus
reappears we will act with all
our resources not just to protect
the American people but the people
of the world You will destroy

out of the desert

Waiting anxiously for the plane to disembark
Wally Mike and Robby in a wheelchair They move
forward to greet the small African man who emerges from

the plane Dr Iwabi smiles and quickens his pace

The cargo hold doors open to reveal cage after cage of
Colobos monkeys

SHOCK CUT TO

BLACK SCREEN
COMPUTER KEYS POUND the letters leap ACROSS the SCREEN

November 21 -- the CDC announced that no evidence of
aquatic spread of the Motaba Virus had ever been obtained
and that its intensive monitoring of the Columbia River

strain Mass production of the antibodies began four
weeks later at the CDC and at the Military Disease
Institute

ROLL CREDITS and --

SHOCK CUT TO

EXT DUGWAY (UTAH) - DUSK

A gila monster hunts for prey its eye darting back and
forth its tongue twitching hungrily It moves past

The barbed-wire fence emblazoned with the sign warning
US MILITARY PROPERTY TRESPASSING STRICTLY
PROHIBITED

Behind the fence the duplexes are dark and abandoned

The gila monster catches a fly and disappears into the
night

FADE OUT

THE END
