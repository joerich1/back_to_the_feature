Flashes in blurs of EVERGREEN trees whipping by--
INTERCUT WITH
The opening CREDITS and old CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
pS Two pale teenage DEAD BODIES maimed tay face down at
e lake’s edge Their wounds savage animal-like tears in

the flesh

CAUTION TAPE on sticks cordon off the area A CAMCORDER is
planted in the mud not five feet from the bloody scene

Sprinting FOOTSTEPS crack dead limbs-- heavy feminine
GRUNTS as she slices through heavy brush she cries her
face cut bleeding--

TO

EXT FOREST - DAY - CONTINUOUS

aracking her from above a mere blip in the blurs a BROWN
MASS gives chase at an inhuman speed-- just ahead his prey
TRIPS falling to her knees

TO

EXT FOREST - DAY - CONTINUOUS

LUPITA DE ROSA a fiery Latina dirty sweating-- with
Amigos Del Squatche stenciled across her TEE rises to her
feet

The tripping culprit a TENT ripped apart FOOD BAGS
scattered she’s discovered her ravaged CAMP SITE She
clutches a small CAMERA

LUPITA
NINAAAA

She rises noticing the large FOOTPRINTS and DRAG MARKS in
the area leading to a TREE She inches closer flies buzz in
the surrounding BUSHES Fumbling to operate her camera it
blinks on-- LOW BATTERY

Pushing the camera between branches eyeing her view finder--
she stumbles back keeling over to retch ry heaving

Only to notice the pile of CLOTHES she’s landed in they’r
hers-- and Nina’s AMIGOS DEL SQUATCHE SHIRT all covere in
BLOOD she breaks down muttering
LUPITA (CONTD)
Padre nuestro que estas en los
cielos-- please get me out of
here

-from behind a loud THUD plunks in a BUSH next to her She
stumbles back trying to stop her crying when plop a
red DRIP lands on her leg Then another Another She id0ks
up to--

--dangling human INTESTINES As it gives way to gravity the
body free falling--

Lupita SCREAMS and the BEAST HOWLS wild a victory cry

EXT CAMPGROUNDS - MAIN GATE - DAY 2

Removing the CAMP CLOSED SIGN hung on the OPEN gate the big
plotting EYES of Park Ranger ANITA BISHOP perk at the
SCREAMS

Her dark hair ina tight bun no makeup-- she’s tanned and
toned the result of life in her surroundings Her eyes lift
above into the treeline as she loads her tool belt into her
TRUCK “did I hear something”

REMINGTON RIFLE strapped on her back her hand moves to the
9MM on her hip-- she turns down the CLASSICAL MUSIC playing
from the dash and listens-- nothing but nature

She loads up to go with a smile she stares up to the newly
restored sign

ANITA
»-much better than Mother’s old
one
Crooked branches make up its jagged letters--
WELCOME TO MERRYMAKER CAMPGROUND
TO

From it’s vantage point high in the trees the BEAST watches
Anita pull through the GATE jumping out to lock up

It shifts limbs to follow her as she drives on-- passing
the quaint CABINS and a MAIN HALL giving way to a large
FIELD a LAKE in the distance

Her TRUCK disappears under the foliage into the spider web
of PATHS cut out of the wild to make up the Merrymaker
Campgrounds

As the sun fades a CLAW grips a branch bits of FLESH and
BLOOD cover it-- the monster growls us to

INT ROLAND’S HOUSE - OFFICE - DUSK 3

The SMALL SPACE is seclusive cozy--

A POSTER hangs above the anonymous MAN seated at his desk
typing by the window-- THE MERRYMAKER MURDERER BOOK COVER an
ominous CABIN 13 in thick woods blood sprayed all over the
outside-- across its bottom

and a huge RED BANNER to crown it all-- 10 MILLION COPIES
SOLD

Big blue EYES stare at a COMPUTER SCREEN moving along as
fingers type his WEDDING RING clacking against keys His
lips mutter the words as they’re written

ROLAND (0S
She’d caught him in her trap
the smug bastard All the son of a
bitch could muster in his defense
was a lyric from better gays P past
As her gun muzzle nestled between
his lips he quivered saying--

ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN the last line-- “No one knows what
its like to feel these feelings like I do And I blame

He leans back-- his eyes on the verge of tears

Drying off stepping in front of his reflection is ROLAND
BAUMGARNER He combs his hair back leaning in to loathe
the gray in his beard He eyes cologne next to his removed

He spritzes puts on the ring then sizes his options on the
bed new JEANS with tags but he chooses the second option

WEREWOLF MASK

time

CHRISTINE
(noticing)

CHRISTINE
--I didn’t buy them for you

ROLAND
I am still capable of doing a few
things myself

CHRISTINE
You’re all grown up

She squeezes his cheeks in her hand hard then

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
Get all your writing done

ROLAND
Yeah I’m almost there-- I had a
breakthrough but I don’t think I

CHRISTINE

A dim COI

KARA (25
of the Cl
done u

)

LLEGE LECTURE HALL

a cute blonde finishes giving her report in front

LASS She wears a PHANTOM OF THE OPERA MASK makeup
on it Blown up behind her a PHOTO of Kara and her

TEST SUBJECT a more hideous version her makeup Joker-like

The rest of the class-- 15 STUDENTS

KARA
-my test patient’s charade of
misconstrued feelings will lead to
misguided intentions Therefore no
matter how she chooses to doll up
now this will manifest one day in
her actions The makeup is merely
her mask covering the scars none of
us COREE
ipping a page
but ape ing 2 eet t with her

feelings or even her way of
thinking What choice did she have
She’s labeled a “freak” triggering
years of op Ee ae ing her true
eelings-- loneliness inadequacy--
the inability to live “u up to the
standard” A standard set by whom
Daddy didn’t give affection Mommy
didn’t care So who’s left

all wear masks-- alien

funny scary a catcher’s mask homemade all kinds

KARA (CONTD)

Each and everyone of us here

(then)
If we don’t begin to recognize and
help these types of people before
it reaches a point where maniacal
thoughts become actions you might
never know when your wors
nightmare could be sitting right
next to you

(then)
Thank you

The lights come ati the class claps Roland sits anonymous
is

amongst them

wolf mask As the kids remove masks

ROLAND

Kinda exhilarating isn’t it That
feeling you get behind the mask
a strange freedom right An
anonymity-- with the power to do
almost anything you want

(he stands)
Powerful imagery Kara Very
creative

(she smiles)

(MORE)
ROLAND (CONTD)
My one criticism if you can even
call it that-- what to do about the
people who love their masks Those
who refuse to take it off ever
Are they worth the time money and
resources

As he makes his way through the row mask still on

The problem is our foundation
built on ‘We the People’ was
trampled over by the “Time Money
and Resources People” who
conveniently are never available
when--

ROLAND
--wa-wah-wa-wah-- liberal alert

KARA
Is it democratic or republican to
let our society devolve into a self-
centered existence

ROLAND
Can we get some poll numbers on
that

KARA

--or hell who knows maybe my test
patient ig an evil genius plotting
to murder me during our follow up
session and Chaos Theory wins
again

The class bursts laughter-- Roland too-- Kara’s eyes linger
on Roland as he approaches the podium He pulls off his
mask whispering something to her it makes her smile

He moves her aside reaching down to a small CAULDRON below
Holding it up

ROLAND
Provocative Inspiring But is it A
Plus Material

He holds up a neutral thumb the class wavers then all raise
thumbs up

ROLAND (CONTD)
THE TRIBE HAS SPOKEN CHOOSE YOUR
TREAT SALTY OR SWEET

She reaches up her eyes on him as she pulls a RED LOLLIPOP

KARA
--my favorite color
ROLAND
to the class)
Due for Tuesday Lab-- minimum 1000
words on your mostvivid memory of
when your “maniacal thoughts didn’t
become conscious actions” and what
ositive effect you believe it’s
ad in your young lives
(waving)
Make good choices this weekend my
pet brains

The class murmurs shuffling out-- Roland begins to gather
his things-- after a moment

KARA (0S)
You really think I was inspiring

Stepping up close behind him

ROLAND
My neurons are still buzzing

KARA
I was thinking of basing a book on
my test patient from my thesis A
story based on her fucked up
story

She pops her sucker out biting her lip--
KARA (CONTD

-would that be something that you
could help me with

ROLAND

Id be more than happy to offer my--
KARA

--perfect when can we start
ROLAND

Um well have you already

cleared the idea with Dean Winters

KARA
Ew he’s such a creeper Every time
I see him he always tries to touch
me-—-
(Ro laughs quickly)

--but yeah I totally ran it by
him yesterday and he said it was a
great idea He actually thought you
were the perfect person for me

ROLAND
euh huh
(a charged beat then)
Okay look I think there are some
things to consider before we jump
into this

(MORE)
ROLAND (CONTD)
We all have voices in our heads
but sometimes it gets hard to hear
which one is speaking the loudest
and if its message is most
important you understand

(she nods)

Let’s talk more next week

KARA
You’re gonna make me wait a whole
week Are you trying to drive me
crazy
(then)
Are you having office hours this
weekend

ROLAND
um no

KARA
--okay never mind It’s fine
As she starts to go

ROLAND
Christine told me she explained our
reasons with the whole nanny
situation right I hope she wasn’t
too--

KARA
--firm but fair Tell her again for
me I’m really really sorry I
didn’t think I’m an idiot I just--

ROLAND
--hey it’s “water under the
bridge” now No skin off our
backs No harm no foul

KARA
“No harm no foul” I like that
(then)
That reminds me-- check your e-mail
before you get home

She allows him he grabs her breasts a little too eager

CHRISTINE

curious

Roland takes it reading

ROLAND

My name is Marilyn M Bishop you

-they have endured so much over
the past fifteen years they simply
deserve only the beauty that
Merrymaker holds

He looks up clearly blown away
ROLAND (CONTD)

Why would you ever think of
throwing this away
CHRISTINE
It’s a really sweet kind of
obsessive fan letter in respect to
a book you wrote 7 years ago

ROLAND
(offended)
Calling an invitation to a Re-
Opening of the place I made famous
isn’t just a fan letter It was her
last dying wish for Chrissake

sporadically entangling vines and branches a maze of
foliage

Roland practices Lamaze breathing stepping slowly but
looses his balance when he steps on something

Ro looks down into the grass and immediately jumps
horrified retching

Anita scurries over to find LUPITA’S CAMERA and her bloody
severed HAND and HUMOROUS BONE still attached Anita grips
her RIFLE cocked and ready--

screams firing a SHOT into the air

again ripping at him HOWLING BLOODY MURDER as its nails
slice Ro’s face

Ro tries desperately to kick it off but it tears Ro’s SHIRT
in half cutting into his chest with quick slashes it cuts
Roland springing off of him

Anita stumbles to her feet grabbing her discarded SHOTGUN as
it sprints diving into the ravine

The BEAST bobs between trees sliding quickly descending--
Anita fires a shot but shatters only tree bark She
steadies catches it in her shaking SrTE-SCOPE pulls a quick
trigger-—

cradle you in her bosom forever

(she hits him

No All that’s left to do is break
them down and start over

MARILYN (CONTD)
§pbe stops hitting)
Our divine mother provides us all
obstacles to supply us the
nutrients of opportunity we need
for our growth as a species You
are my challenge

She hits him again violent swings till she breaks down--
falling to her knees grabbing his face in her hands

MARILYN (CONTD)
You are the fruits of a mother’s
labor laid out to rot in the

sun I gave you sanctuary but
you pit your Mommys nipple and now
it blee

(she strikes him again)
YOU WILL RISE OUT OF THESE ASHES
AND YOUR SCARS WILL BE YOUR PROOF
YOU CAN NOT BE TAKEN DOWN BY MERE
MORTAL MEN

She swings the branch back ready to strike again-- but is
stopped-- his shaking arms rise holding out a bloodied WHITE
BLOUSE in front of her-- giving up

As she lowers the branch hurrying FOOTSTEPS stop at the door-
a more youthful Burl stands in the doorway his eyes fix on
the two BODIES of the TEENAGE CAMPERS laying lifeless side

by side on the bed-- clothes draped covering their privates

Marilyn surveys the carnage

BURL y
What in God’s name Marilyn

Marilyn stands in the corner-- something COWERED behind her
in the shadows--

MARILYN
The parents are out on a search
now We don’t have much time
I need you right now baby If I’m
to save this place I need you
right now to be strong for me

BURL
What the hell

MARILYN
This is our secret from now on

Burl nods trying to rationalize

MARILYN (CONTD)
Where are Anita and Poppy

BURL
Anita’s cabin

MARILYN
-good I’1ll go make sure they
don’t move but I need you totake
that bear you shot that’s still in

(he’ s perplexed)
--you’ll have to be quick

EXT CAMPGROUNDS - LAKE - NIGHT 91

Burl kneels at the end of the dock-- a BEAR CLAW turned into
a weapon its nails razor sharp He bends to the water his
reflection rippling he fights the emotion as he pyunges
the bloody CLAW-- rinsing the crimson and flesh off

ands

Staring across the lake-- the TWO BODIES lay just off the
the WATER’S EDGE blood seeping into the dirt looking as if
an animal shreddéd them

Burl stands tears in his eyes he pulls the CLAW across his
chest cutting into his clothes and skin

get you out here but when you

Anita steps up pointing her RIFLE into his crotch

ANITA (CONTD)
Now how much are the lives of that
cutie pie wife and that 1il’ bun in
her oven worth to you What about
your little girl Isabella

Roland lunges violently at her screaming behind his taped
mouth but she skips back Roland blinks-- helpless-- when
his attention shifts to Burl backing in the door holding
his TRANQ RIFLE out for Poppy shaking a blouse in his hand--

BURL
Take that Pop-- then get back

Anita grips her RIFLE

POPPY
You can’t bring that thing in

Anita holds her RIFLE aimed at the door ready Burl holds
the end of a rope the blouse in hand Burl steps in pulling
the ROPE CHAIN-- hooked to the other end in the straight
jacket is the beast WAYNE BISHOP Anitas face sterns-- Poppy’s drops

POPPY
that’s not a bigfoot

Wayne’s DARK EYES rise darting scouring the room-- he’s
timid but on high alert

His hair is horribly DREAD-LOCKED matted with leaf bits and
DIRT His face is dirty and tanned-- his beard long and
mangy his feet are big and bare covered with dirt and
grime from a life spent in the woods

Under the ROPES--

He wears as a cover the SKINNED HIDE of a BLACK BEAR-- it
covers his entire body arms and legs adding girth to his
already TALL FRAME-- the skins SEWN together with leather
STRAPS interweaving up the STOMACH were the cut was made

BURL
That’s your brother

He jumps back piercing the small space with a scream Burl
steps over moving Poppy back--

Burl holds up the faded blouse-- smelling it

snaps the blouse away growling retreating to a corner

abandoned space It’s dark dank and lonely-- his hair
starting to grow long his beard too

BURL
Who’s innocent The boys

ANITA
He’s not a boy he’s a fully grown

to blame than he is so shut it

Wayne moves back in the corner scratching dirt from the
BLOUSE

POPPY
He doesn’t understand Annie--

BURL
And he’s never hurt you has he
Let him alone--

Anita steps close to Burl’s ear

ANITA
--you want to be even This wipes
the slate clean
(then)
He can’t be here anymore You do
it or I will

Burl looks to the bloody Roland He straightens--

ANITA (CONTD)
You want that cigar You have your
orders

A slow burn-- as Burl straightens his fatigues-- stoic Burl
moves opening his arms coaxing Wayne-- he moves from the
corner Burl reaches up to untie the BEAR SKIN SUIT

He unravels the first few intersections finally the HIDE
falls to the floor crumpling lifeless Under LAYERS of old
clothes stained LONG- JOHNS dirty and hole filled as hell--
Burl shows him to Roland proudly

BURL
He is what will always be great
about humanity No matter how deep
the shit gets the spirit is
undying
(back to Wayne
Goddamn National monument

He grips Wayne’s face gently pulling him level-- eye to eye

BURL (CONT’D)
I swore to your Momma to protect
you till your dying breath--

Suddenly Wwayns s EYES BULGE-- re-flexing he SCREECHES--
grabbing Burl by the throat choking him

BURL (CONTD)
They ain’t hauling ou off in
chains Don’t fight bear

Wayne looks down Burl’s CARVING KNIFE plunged in his gut--
the blood oozing Wayne’s grip loosens as he collapses to
the floor Wayne breathes heavily-- forehead to forehead

BURL (CONT’D)
No more hurting

Rushing him Poppy swings the butt of her RIFLE into Burl’s
BACK

POPPY
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING

ANITA

POPPY
HE NEEDS HELP ASSHOLE

Burl fights off the attack she swings hitting him wildly
kicking him Anita tries to wrestle the gun away as Burl’s
pummeled by Pop’s onslaught he swings back grabs PILLOWS
SHEETS anything he can trying to block her

POPPY (CONTD)
WERE NOT FUCKING ANIMALS

Finally he turns cold-cocking POPDY in the face-- she
stumbles back her nose bloodied ying into Roland sending
them both flailing

BURL
YALL AINT EVEN MY FUCKIN’ KIDS
BLAAAAAM
Burl is blasted off his feet by a RIFLE BLAST

The loud thunderous strike echoes silencing the room Burl
stumbles back the momentum from the shot tangling him in the
sheets-- he collapses

POPPY turns to Anita-- and her SMOKING GUN BLOOD splattered
er face As Burl’s eyes flutter closed Anita steps
over pulling out his CIGAR shoving into his lips taking
his ZIPPO from his pocket lighting it for him

ANITA
Enjoy

Poppy bursts into tears collapsing to the floor

POPPY
Jesus Fuck Annie

Anita wipes the blood splatter off her face re-rolling her
hair tight into a bun

ANITA
Burl and I had unfinished business
that I just finished

POPPY
(from her knees )
FUCK YOU ANITA I’m finished I’m
done with this shit You and youre

Anita steps in front of her her RIFLE aimed at Poppy’s
chest

ANITA
Try andhold it together Penelope--

professor’s tape so we can get
down to business and get Wayne
outta here-- he stinks

A stand off Anita’s aim doesn’t flinch till finally Poppy
marches over and rips the DUCT TAPE off Ro Roland breathes
heavily-- spitting at Poppy

ROLAND

Anita moves the tip of the rifle between his lips

ANITA
--Shhhhhh I know exactly who you

ROLAND

Please just be quiet and listen to
what you’re gonna need to do in
order to leave here with most of

Pop rises going to work as Anita tosses a SHEET crudely
over Burl She pulls up a chair next to him

ANITA (CONTD)
I’ve always wanted to ask you
something Roland Face to face

You never camped here-- so our

Roland steps in the ROPES tied round him-- piles of DIRTY
CLOTHES scattered with leaves and twigs are all over the
floor

guess for the the number of days

around when you return home and
admit to your wife you’re a coward
a liar-- and you fucked my sister

Poppy looks under the BED pulling out of a BLACK DUFFEL She
hands the bag to Anita-- who pulls a STACK of 4x6 PHOTOS and
a STUFFED BLACK BEAR-- Roland eyes it

ANITA (CONTD)
There are a couple numbers of yours
I havent quite gotten yet--
(holding up the bear)
I thought this was so cute

Roland stares realizing the connection the same as
Isabellas-- Anita plops the STACK of PHOTOS onto his lap

ANITA (CONTD)
Now I realize there has to be
incentive for both sides in every
eal

Roland looks down-- multiple PICTURES of Isabella asleep in
her bed with her STUFFED BEAR-- Anita places one on top--

Hidden within the trees staring back at him-- long SCARS
runs up the back of the fleshy thigh a SHOTGUN by her side
Anita’s BIG EYES peer through the cheap WOLF MASK a wicked
smirk on her face--
