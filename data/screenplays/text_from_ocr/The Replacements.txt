THE REPLACEMENTS

by

Vince McKewin

SECOND DRAFT

February 19

FADE IN
EXT MARINA DEL REY - DAY

Its raining lightly in the harbor and the
water around the moored boats looks dirty and
cold

We PICK UP a sad excuse for a boat sitting in
an end slip

Its a sea-gull-shitcovered thirtyfoot cabin
cruiser that hasnt cruised in a long long
time A ratty looking unpainted plywood
addition has been nailed to the top of the
cabin Its partially covered with a blue
plastic tarp

SUPERIMPOSE MARINA DEL REY CALIFORNIA -
FALL

The tarp moves and SHANE FALCOs half-naked
torso emerges from under it Shane is late

twenties golden boy handsome but quickly

going to seed He looks hung over

Shane glances up at the sky and rain He
pulls on the top part of an old patched wet

suit and zips it up He shivers

EXT MARINA DEL REY HARBOR - DAY

Were BUZZING around the harbor with Shane in
an old Zodiac inflatable DINGHY
Shane has pulled up the attached rubber hood
to his wet suit so that only the white pasty
oblong of his face is visible

Its still raining as he steers the little
boat around the sailboats and yachts

He pulls up to a fiftyfoot sailboat and CUTS
the ENGINE

With practiced moves he ties the dinghy to
the rear rail of the sailboat and clips a
bill for services rendered on the sailboats
stern line

He slips on a weight belt puts on a pair of
old gaffer taped goggles jams the end of a
air-hose in his mouth and falls backward out
of the dinghy and into the water

EXT UNDERWATER - DAY

Its dark dirty and murky Suddenly Shane
floats INTO FRAME and comes AT us with a long
spatula

ANOTHER ANGLE

He attacks the underside of the sailboat
which is covered with green algae muck that
hangs a foot off the bottom of the boat
The spatula scrapes away the green mess
revealing the pure white underside of the
boat

CLOSE ON SHANE

As he scrapes Muck from the boat floats
past him This doesnt look like fun

As he works he happens to look down and
notices something on the bottom

SHANES POV

Amidst the beer cans and other trash
something golden is sitting on the bottom
BACK TO SCENE

Shane takes a deep pull on his hose lets it
go and drifts down

A shaft of sunlight penetrates the murky
water and reveals a broken trophy half-buried
in the mud Shane kneels over it and picks

it up

The trophy is almost a full-size football
rendered in bronze attached to a broken base

Shane turns the ball over in his hands He
grips the seams like hes done this before

Then he holds the football out in front of
him

Suddenly he starts barking garbled signals
to an imaginary offense He turns to his
running back as he yells something like Blue
31 It comes out in bubbles

He cocks his left leg and his wide receiver
goes in motion

Then on the snap he turns and starts a five
step drop

He moves in slow motion because hey hes
underwater He executes a perfect play
action fake on the third step of his drop
and looks down field for his receivers

But theres a blitz He steps up in the
pocket but a linebackers arm almost takes
his head off He dodges he bobs he weaves
in a kind of delicate ballet

He rolls left and keeps looking for the open
man

Suddenly he points down field pulls up and
cocks his arm

The ball comes behind his ear and snaps
forward in a perfect release

The trophy spins OUT OF FRAME but we HOLD ON
DC)

Shane as he watches his pass Suddenly he
throws both arms up in a touchdown signal

We STAY ON him as he freezes in this pose of
victory fifteen feet underwater on the
trash-covered muddy bottom of Marina Del
Rey

EXT EDWARD FRANCIS ONEIL STADIUM (WASHINGTON

DAY

Bam A Miami Dolphin linebacker crushes a
Washington Redskin running back and lands on
his throat elbow first

Its a beautiful fall day in November and
Miami is beating the Skins in front of
seventy-six thousand crazed Washington fans
The Redskins are at their home stadium better
known as The Big 0

INT CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

JOHN MADDEN and PAT SUMMERALL are calling the
game in shirtsleeves

SUMMERALL
That play my friends
sums up the Redskins
running game all day
long Now Washington
calls their last time
out

Madden leans over to do his diagram that
shows up on your TV screen We STAY ON him
as he draws and explains

MADDEN
Hey the Dolphins do
this as good as
anybody See ina
four three two two
you got the guards
boom Plugging up
the middle then the
corners boom and
boom Are free to

box leaving the
middle linebacker to
cut off the trap
here boom
SUMMERALL

Third and twenty-two
but forget the first
down with eight seconds
showing and the Skins
down by a touchdown

MADDEN
Could be the last play

SUMMERALL
Could be the last play
of the season if the
players go out

EXT SIDELINES - DAY

Redskin quarterback EDDIE MARTEL is
conferring with Redskin head coach BUD TILDON
near the bench Madden and Summerall

continue OVER

MADDEN (VO)
Take it all in people
This could be it for
2000

We MOVE TO veteran Redskin center REESE
EVANS 38 standing on the sidelines uniform
totally clean

He looks near tears

SUMMERALL
(V0)
Once again if you
havent heard it was
announced during
halftime that the
NFL Players
Association will hold a
press conference
immediately following
this game -- that would
make it about five
oclock Eastern time --
and it is expected that

the players union will
announce a strike
effective immediately

ON REDSKINETTES

Twelve striking-looking women dressed in
burgundy and gold are doing some inane
chatter to a section of fans that ignore
them

The girls are led by pretty ANNABELLE
FARRELL a bundle of manic energy inside a
body from heaven

MADDEN (VO)
Its all about money
folks More money of
course and aint it
always The shame of
it is the big losers
are you out there the
fans

ON MARTEL
The Redskin quarterback moves to the huddle

SUMMERALL
(V0)
Here we go Third
down eight seconds to
play ball on the
Dolphins thirty-three
yard line Skins down
by a touchdown

The huddle breaks and Martel sets up over the
center

MARTEL
Green 48 Green 48
Hut Hut

The ball is snapped and Martel drops back
He looks for a receiver and doesnt see
anybody

He steps up in the pocket sees an opening
and takes off running down field

MADDEN (VO)
There goes Martel

Martel is a pretty good broken field runner
for a big guy Plus with the defense
covering every possible receiver hes got a
lot of daylight

Nobody has touched him as he crosses the
fifteen Suddenly a safety smaller than
Martel looms in front of him at the ten

Martel goes down in one of those wimpy
quarterback slides before the safety can even
hit him

BANG The GUN sounds and the game is over

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
They look at each other in disbelief

SUMMERALL
Well Martel goes
down ten yards short of
a score

MADDEN
On maybe the last play
of the season

SUMMERALL
I think he might have
slipped

MADDEN
Yeah theres a lot of
that going around

ON THREE REDSKIN FANS

Well see these guys throughout Theyre
typical low level Washington bureaucrats
named TODD ROD and BOB who live for the Hogs
-- the traditional name for the Redskin
offensive linemen

Todd is shirtless and his entire upper body
is painted Redskin red

At that moment they are livid with their
quarterback and Bob is speaking for them all

BOB
Were coming to your
house tonight and
were gonna fucking
kill you And if you
gota dog were gonna
kill your fucking dog

too

ON ANNABELLE

Behind her the rest of the cheerleaders are
already walking away Annabelle looks at
Quarterback Martel with pure disgust as he
walks off the field

INT LARGE BEDROOM - DAY

The rooms blinds are pulled tightly against
the bright sunlight Only the blue light of
a TV illuminates anything

Suddenly we hear an old man in the bed give
out with a loud piercing wail

The door to the room bangs open and an

English male nurse named AUGUSTINE RIPLEY

dressed in white comes running in Hes

carrying a syringe in each hand poised at

the ready

He runs to the bed of the still wailing

EDWARD FRANCIS ONEIL ONeil is hooked

up to an oxygen tank watching the just

completed Redskin game with the sound off
AUGUSTINE

Did they win or lose
ONeil continues to wail

AUGUSTINE
That has the distinct
tonal quality of a
loss

He puts one needle down and jabs ONeil with
the other one

He murmurs to the old man as he injects him

AUGUSTINE
Nice medicine for a
loss Keeps us calm
Makes us not so sad
Keeps us on an even
keel Gives us some
perspective doesnt
it And well save the
winning medicine for
next Sunday wont we

He finishes

ONEIL

ONEIL
Bullshit he slipped

TILDON
Mister ONeil lets

nobody wants to get
hurt on the last play
before a strike that
could go on for the
rest of the season

ONEIL
You god damn wimp

ONeil throws the phone down Augustine

LINDELL (VO) (CONTD)
Therefore I am
recommending that all
NFL players walk out
and not play until our
demands are met I
want the players to
walk out tall to walk
out righteous to walk
out in the knowledge
that we do this as a
team We shall
overcome the fat cats

his two main coaches give him a presentation
They are offensive coordinator LEO
PILACHOWSKI and defensive coordinator
CHRISTOPHER BANES

PILACHOWSKI
Six phone lines
with internet access on
two One for defense
and one for offense

BANES
We thought we would
skip special teams for
the moment

PILACHOWSKI
Except for a kicker
We definitely need a
kicker A place kicker
over a punter

BANES
The thinking being that
if we lose the toss we
have to be able to at
least kick off

Both coaches laugh nervously McGinty
doesnt say anything

PILACHOWSKI
Okay Heres the list
of every player cut
this past season What
we would like to do
is

McGINTY
(interrupting)

Those people
(pointing to

list)

Most of them were cut

because they were

shitty

McGinty takes out a piece of paper of his own
with a bunch of names on it

McGINTY
Were going to go
another way here Ive
done some scouting
since I retired On an
ad hoc basis of
course And what I
have here is a list of
people Ive kept an eye
on Theyve all played
football somewhere but
only a few in the pros
And theyve all got
something unique to
bring to the game
Were gonna take these
people and try to put
together a winning
team And if nothing
else they should be
fun to watch

McGinty looks up when he senses someone
standing in the doorway Its REESE EVANS
the veteran Redskin we saw standing on the
sidelines with the clean uniform

EVANS
You wont need a

The other biker shakes his head no

The one who asked the question walks over to
the door and listens for a beat Nothing

He turns to go back and suddenly the door
disintegrates in front of a charging man
wearing a police windbreaker

This is DANIEL BATEMAN a big young
psychotic cop who immediately runs over the
poor Biker who was listening at the door

He looks across the field at a big good-
looking kid named BRIAN MURRAY who is in the
middle of a pass rushing drill

Murray looks really fast especially for his
size

McGINTY

with losers

(pause)
Oh shit Im sorry
I didnt mean

SHANE

(interrupting)
Hey its okay Ive
been called worse

ANNABELLE
Like after that Sugar
Bowl game I guess you

could go to India and
some little guy would
run up to me and say
Boy did you suck in

the 92 Sugar Bowl
Annabelle laughs

SHANE
So how come youre
such a fan

ANNABELLE
My dad Hes a huge
Redskin fan For

asks for an autograph on a program The

Lou Pacifico smokes and stares

Bateman is leaning against a wall fully

Murray and signs to him to have a good game
Murray signs back Thanks Coach

Cochran spots McGinty and puts down his
Bible

to lead the team in the
pregame prayer

McGINTY
No No praying
Thats the problem with
professional sports
today too much god
damn praying Five
hundred dollar fine to
the first man I hear
praying

McGinty turns and bums an egg from Mickey and
walks to the middle of the locker room

He eats the egg as he turns slowly and takes
in his players

McGINTY
A lot of people are
waiting for you to fall
on your asses today
And guess what Youre
going to But I dont
give a shit if you look
funny out there Or if
you miss a block or
drop a pass or trip
over your own dick
This is professional
And the difference
between professional
and amateur between
playing for the
Washington Redskins and
Michigan State is
simply money You
are being paid to win
Not just to play Not
just to learn how to be
good sports Not for
the alumni You are
being paid to win I
dont care how the fuck
you do it But Im
demanding it Because
those guys whose place
youre taking have
forgotten that simple
fact So go win it

Redskin management on
the other hand is
going with a bunch of
unknowns Their public
relations people dont
even have bios yet on
most of their players
although well see one
or two familiar faces
out there today

SUMMERALL
Like Shane Falco the
enormously talented
college quarterback
from Ohio State who
never fulfilled his
potential in the pros
(to Madden)
Wow remember that

Sugar Bowl Falco
quarterbacked when
Florida State creamed
them

MADDEN
Oh yeah they were
absolutely decimated

SUMMERALL
Dusted And if Im not
mistaken Falco set a
record in that game for
Bowl interceptions
Anyway for some of
these players this is
another shot a last
shot probably for a
guy like Falco

He spots his receiver he cocks his arm and
wham Morris decks him And of course
lands on him Oooof

MORRIS

In order to get up Morris puts one huge hand
on Shanes helmet and pushes himself up
Shane moans as his face guard digs a four-
inch hole in the turf

ON McGINTY
Hes talking into his mike

McGINTY
You want a time-out
That looks like it
hurt

Shane gets up Hes got a huge piece of turf
stuck in his face guard so that for a beat
we cant even see him

Morris giving him a clear shot at Shane

Morris comes hard and fast

Shane looks downfield winds up turns and
fires the ball at Morriss head

The ball goes like a bullet for five feet and
then sticks like a dart in Morriss face
guard

For a moment Morris is blinded

And Shane is dumbfounded

Then Morris starts to wrestle the ball out of
his mask

SHANE
Get him
Andre and Jamal grab onto Morris who starts
stumbling down field with the ball still

stuck in his helmet

MADDEN (VO)
Morris intercepts
Wait The ball is
stuck in his face

But Morris wont go down Hes still trying
to pry the ball loose as he throws off Jamal

Then he shakes off Andre

ON BRIAN MURRAY

Hes in SLOW MOTION in midair diving towards
Morris

MURRAYS POV

Its absolutely QUIET (hes deaf remember)
as he soars towards Morriss head helmet and
ball

Wham Murrays full body weight hits Morris
in the helmet which flies off and rolls
across the field with the ball still stuck in
it

OUT OF THE SILENCE we suddenly hear the hit
and the crowd roar

Morris goes down like a building with Murray
buried in his throat

ON BALL AND HELMET
Its in the very chubby hands of Mickey Lee
who is rumbling downfield with the
fumblehelmet recovery
New York players have been slow to pick this
up because they too have been admiring the

lick that Murray put on Morris

Suddenly the whole team is chasing Lee

They catch him pretty easily at the twenty
but Lee represents a lot of weight

Lee staggers across the ten shaking players
off left and right

One defensive halfback sacrifices himself and
throws himself at Lees feet

Lee trips over the guy gains his footing
again walks on the guy (who screams in

agony) and falls into the end zone carrying
three players with him

ON MADDEN AND SUMMERALL
John is beside himself

MADDEN
Lee scores Lee

love to see a fat guy

He gets up in jubilation spikes the
ballhelmet combination and runs through the
back of the end zone
But he doesnt stop Hes aiming for a low
wall that separates the first row of fans
from the field

ON FOUR FANS

They see Mickey rumbling at them and they all
get the picture at the same time They
scream
