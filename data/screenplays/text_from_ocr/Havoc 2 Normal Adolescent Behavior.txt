Normal Adolescent Behavior

Directors Note

Teenagers have sex This is a movie about teenagers who have sex
but that doesnt mean theres sex in the movie Some of the best
teen films have been about sex and love and nobody ever got naked
This film will look beautiful and everyone will look sexy but
theres absolutely no reason anyone has to get naked

EXT HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

CREDITS ROLL OVER ‘GIRL ON THE STREET’ INTERVIEWS done on
a cheap video camera in various locations around Chagrin

Falls Ohio (population 6500 an hour south of
Cleveland)

A TEEN GIRL 1 speaks into the camera playing with her
hair as she tries not to giggle

TEEN GIRL 1
Mostly girls just hook up with guys at
parties but usually it’s with someone
they know like a friend I mean it’s
not like I hear people saying I’m saving
myself for marriage or anything

She giggles and we cut to a TEEN GIRL 2 this one
scrunching her face into her turtleneck to hide her
identity Her friends mill in the background

TEEN GIRL 2
The point of being young is to experience
a bunch of people so you know what you
want In a few more years Ill be able
to tell a good one from a bad one

CROWD GIRL 1
(yelling out)
And the big ones from the little ones

Another teen laughs revealing her face and we cut to a
TEEN GIRL 3 who has her hair cropped close She speaks
directly at the camera dangerously close to the lens

TEEN GIRL 3
They’re nasty sluts And slutty girls
become slutty women and then they marry
nasty guys who drive gross cars and
smell like cheap beer
A TEEN GIRL 4 pushes the Teen Girl 3 aside and screams
TEEN GIRL 4
Is this like those Girls Gone Wild Are
you from MTV
SHE RAISES HER SHIRT AND FLASHES HER BREASTS SCREAMING

TEEN GIRL 4 (CONT’D)
WHOOOO

The screen freezes The title

Normal Adolescent Behavior

Appears over her breasts

EXT CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL QUAD - DAY

MUSIC Gary Glitter sings his raunchy “Do You Wanna Touch
Me”

Late Summer in Chagrin Falls Ohio about forty minutes
south of Cleveland WENDY BERGMAN (senior 17 beautiful
but not ready to accept it) walks through the “Coop”
private school grounds she leads us under banners that
say “WELCOME NEW CLASS” and “DON’T DIS THE ORIENTATION --
HAVE FUN AND WELCOME” It all feels like it could be the
Summer of Love except for the girls are wearing Seven
jeans and the guys are wearing vintage and everyone’s
hair is done even the ‘alternative’ kids

Wendy passes by as a group of fifty students does a ‘lap
sit’ -- they stand in a circle and then sit down at the
same time Eventually they fall amid general hysterical
laughter If Wendy wasn’t rolling her eyes before she
certainly is now

ACROSS THE QUAD we meet BILLIE (17 short blond hair and
vintage clothes hottest girl in school according to
current web polls) She is walking towards Wendy she is
blond to Wendy’s brunette intelligent enthusiasm to
Wendy’s brilliant sarcasm They are a perfect match for
each other

A car pulls up quickly between them as they near the
parking lot It squeals to a stop and SEAN MAYER (17
tall with good looks that skew slightly pretty) gets out
of the car The car squeals away If it looks like the
opening of the Breakfast Club well all the better He
skulks towards the orientation festivities but he also
steals a glance at Wendy

Billie yells out to Wendy

BILLIE
Woman

Wendy jogs the last few feet to her best friend and then
they join the rest of the group Besides Billie there is
ANN Chinese with a defiant red streak in her hair JONAH
a stoner reading a Miles Davis biography

blue eyes and wants desperately to fit in Which is why
he pulls out and places on his head a TRUCKER’S CAP

The GROUP GROANS

PRICE

BILLIE
You should burn that hat

ANN
It’s plastic Toxic fumes

BILLIE
He could burn a little of it
Symbolically

She jumps up fishing a lighter from her bag She hands
the hat and the lighter to Price

BILLIE (CONT’D)
Do it Show us you’re better than the
hat

The group looks at Wendy asking for permission

WENDY
Burn a little It’1ll be good for you

Price burns a little of the hat sheepishly and the
group all cheer Price leans over to hug the girls and
it quickly turns into a wrestlingplay fight Wendy looks
up and sees a FRESHMEN GIRL and guy whispering and
looking at the group’s antics Wendy stands up brushing
herself off

WENDY (CONT’D)
Sorry

JONAH
(to the Freshmen)
Can we help you

The rest of the group get up as well looking slightly
sheepish except for Billie The Freshmen stand there
waiting

WENDY
Frigging right

All six hug with real warmth Somebody yells out to
them from a passing car

STUDENT IN CAR

become cooler than blowing a rock star

BILLIE
You’ve never blown a rock star

WENDY
Neither have you

They laugh The other four are a little ways away but
Billie hangs on to Wendy for a second

BILLIE
What if you could blow a rock star

WENDY
And ruin what we have

Billie slaps Wendy’s ass

BILLIE
That’s my girl

Wendy waves at Billie as she joins the others and walks
off Wendy is all alone outside the school She wanders
around kicking a few pebbles she picks a leaf froma
tree and starts humming the theme to “The A-Team”

Wendy goes back inside the school

INT CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL HANGAR - DAY

The school is empty a little eerie Still humming
Wendy heads towards the classrooms which are all ina
large hangar type building -- each classroom is divided
with partitions into a “bay” In the center is a library
and at the far corner a SCIENCE classroom

INT CHAGRIN COOP SCHOOL LAB —- DAY

Inside the science area Wendy opens a door removing
ETHANOL Pouring the ethanol into a wide-mouthed beaker
she places the leaf in the ethanol lights a Bunsen
burner and lets the leaf start to boil in the solution
Sean watches unseen by Wendy

SEAN
Blowing up the school

Wendy tries to act cool

WENDY

Sean hums the “A-Team” theme back Wendy is caught for a
second then comes right back at him

WENDY
The “lay of the land”

SEAN
I’m new I figured I could I dunno
memorize where everything was

WENDY
There’s not much to memorize

She turns him around and points out the “landmarks” of
school

WENDY (CONT’D)
These are the classrooms No walls so
you have to have respect for everyone
That’s a big word around here -- respect
Make sure you use it inappropriately

SEAN
Like irony

WENDY
That would be “incorrectly”

Wendy points out some more places in the school

WENDY (CONT’D)
That’s the library We gather in the
lounge for announcements every Thursday
for Community Meeting better known as
“Where people bitch about the lack of
respect in the public bathrooms”

SEAN
You’re not blowing anything up are you

Wendy turns back to her leaf

WENDY
Get the lights

She gestures to the other side of the room Sean runs to
the switch hits it The sun has started to set so the
room is relatively dark

Wendy turns the Bunsen burner off The leaf GLOWS BRIGHT
RED

WENDY (CONT’D)
I just read about it and I wanted to try
it The electrons in the leaf are

‘excited’ They have these names that
are so Human Excited Lazy
Aggressive Did you know they can be
“impure”

SEAN

You couldn’t try it during school

WENDY
I hate chemistry

SEAN
But

She puts her finger to her lips

WENDY
Shhh

SEAN
(smiles)
Your secret’s safe I swear

WENDY
Who would you tell

He’s stung but hides it

SEAN
My mom’s a chemist I would never make
fun of you for liking this stuff

WENDY
(indignant he’s hit close to
home )
If you did I’d kick your ass

SEAN
If I did it would be ironic

WENDY
That’s incorrect

SEAN
Kicking my ass would be inappropriate

WENDY
No but it would be disrespectful

Nathan grabs a cookie off the tray and hands it to Sean

towards Sean and his hand ENDS UP ON SEAN’S CROTCH

There is a moment where Nathan doesn’t know what to do
His hand actually stays there he’s so confused

INT HOUSE PARTY LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT 27

LOOKING AROUND THE ROOM we see that everyone is treated
to television sets running non-stop porn Everyone
drinks Bong hits in the corner In the background
girls disappear with guys into a variety of rooms
Basically an average teen party

Sean stands with Allyson RYAN (a girl also a senior)
is sitting on a kitchen counter nearby but out of
earshot with her boyfriend AARON who is strumming a
guitar Alex another senior hands out beers to Sean
and Allyson

ALLYSON
I mean I understand why the guys do it
but the girls It is total depravity

THE DOOR THAT SEAN IS LEANING ON OPENS and a sexy girl
comes out of the bedroom wiping her mouth Sean lets
her pass and she looks at him smiling seductively A
moment later a guy comes out buttoning his pants

ALLYSON (CONT’D)

(pointing)
You should ask Ryan and Aaron They got
out
SEAN
(laughing)

Got out What it’s a cult

ALLYSON
(serious )

SEAN
And they all have sex with each other

ALLYSON
It’s pathetic I know

Sean looks around at all the sex and drinking going on at
this party

SEAN
So why is what you’re doing different
than what they’re doing

ALLYSON
(defensive)
It just is See we invite them every
week and they never show Obviously they
think they’re better than us

Allyson notices something across the room

ALLYSON (CONT’D)
Oh my god They put in a pole That is
so cool

Allyson goes towards the stripper pole someone has
installed in the rec room

ALLYSON (CONT’D)
I wanna turn

Sean moves through the party heading for the kitchen
where he last saw Ryan Two guys play Playstation in one
room while a girl gives another guy a lap dance a blank
stare on her face Sean walks by TWO TANK-TOP GIRLS
going to the bathroom wearing almost identical tank-tops

TANK-TOP GIRL 1

SEAN (CONTD)
So you know Wendy

RYAN

SEAN
I just want to-- she’s my next door
neighbor you know

RYAN
Yeah

There’s a pause as Ryan and Sean watch a bunch of girls
playing spin the bottle for a group of very rowdy guys

RYAN (CONTD)
Look we just had an arrangement the
eight of us And when Aaron and I didn’t
want to be with them anymore we stopped
It’s not like I had to be de-programmed
Everyone wants it to be this big deal

bedroom As they enter Tank-Top Girls look on

INT ROBERT’S HOUSE LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT 29

In contrast to the party Robert’s house is quiet and

pulls out WENDY’S BOX from Robert’s house She drops it
on the ground in front of Wendy

BILLIE
I think your queer ass boyfriend would
really dig this huh I was thinking of
putting it in his locker A little after-
track-practice surprise

Wendy goes for it but Billie is faster and she holds onto
the box

WENDY

(calmly as possible)
You know what Go ahead It doesn’t
work like that with us Even better why
don’t you give it to him in class
Because even if you posted it on the
internet and took out billboards he
wouldn’t care

BILLIE
I think he’s gonna like the pictures from
this summer especially

Billie opens her mouth very wide and does a pretty good
oral sex simulation Wendy remains calm

She walks up to the camera and shoves her hand in the
lens so we catch a distorted glimpse of exactly what a
mall job will buy at Zales

The House Party with the porn the drinking the girls
making out with other girls Ann is giving a guy a pole
dance with a blank look on her face

We track through the same party and the Tank-Top Girl 1
from the first party pulls Price into a bedroom

INT BILLIE’S HOUSE ROOM —- NIGHT 102

Billie has the box open in front of her but we don’t see
her face as she sits on the floor of her room Laid out
on the floor encircling her are various mementos She
lays each one out carefully in some order we are not
privy to She smooths a few pictures she carefully
places a lighter next to an old license plate As we
circle the items we catch a passing glimpse of Billie
who might be crying

INT BERGMAN HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT 103

Wendy sits on the kitchen counter watching Nathan cook
She is holding a wooden spoon and Nathan hands her a
mixing bowl so Wendy mixes She kicks her legs absently
against the wooden cabinet and then kicks her shoes off

The camera pulls back leaving the room so we see Wendy
framed in the doorway Nathan walks out and it is just
Wendy alone and happy a dopey half smile on her face as
the credits start to roll
