FADE IN

A drift of sand whirls up around a miniature figurine of

ELVIS PRESLEY

clad in a Hawaiian print shirt and brandishing a sequined
ukulele A phosphorescent blue glow flickers in the

background and a rainbow swirl of glitter shimmers around the
captive King

Eerily as though someone were pulling strings the miniature
Starts to gyrate its hips Fasterfasterfasteruntil
it all gels into a scintillating blur

But its just a toy -- one of those throwaway snow-globes in
the convex shape of a glass ball A puppet in the hands of

ALTON BEGGET

a good ole boy and henchman of the Memphis Mafia Bored he

tosses the toy aside steps to a rain-splattered window and
peers out into the night

OUTSIDE

the sodium-yellow headlights of an approaching vehicle scream
through the stormy darkness The nearing light seeps through
the blinds and races down the hall into

An ancient re-run of Hee-haw blares on the TV with Buck Owens

and Roy Clark astrummin and ahollerin Alton picks up the

you

He hangs up straightens his tie and makes a smooth exit past
some of the Kings Court seated at a coffee table theyre
eating from large buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken -- the
Last Supper They are captivated by the “Heee-e-e Haww-w-w
hyuck hyuck hyuck that emanates from the TV

Crumpled papers and clothes

A HAND

EXT JOAD HOUSE -— MORNING

A small split-level place left over from Leave’It To Beaver
now crumbles from disrepair -- chipped paint bent aluminum

siding a rickety porch unhinged shutters an untended and
overgrown yard

A freckle-faced PAPER BOY speeds by on a Schwinn Roadster and
launches a paper at the front door It hits with a THUD and
lands in a pile of unopened junk mail

BURN IN SEATTLE THE PRESENT

The door creaks opens and a pair of 199 foam-rubber thongs

appear hairy toes sprouting from beneath The toes belong
to

ROGER DRUBB

a 40ish man of the high-school hero” ilk -- he tries to hide
his now frowsy appearance under an over-sized terri-cloth
robe with thinning elbows He looks over his flattened nose
and quickly scans the neighborhood then heads inside with

the newspaper whistling an atonal rendition of Jailhouse
Rock

INSIDE

Roger trudges through the strangely sparse interior the
place seems to be in a state of perpetual tag sale -- an
ancient RCA TV some haphazardly placed chairs a coffee

table piles of newspapers Interior design is decidedly
temporary

Roger stops at an end table picks up a throwing dart and
launches it across the room scoring a direct—hit on a veivet

Pleased with his aim Roger Flips the poster the finger and

a LUMP sleeping beneath heavy blankets in a seemingly well-
appointed space

Roger mangles the aria using ridiculous hand motions to
counter-point the dramatic rises and falls as he angrily
assembles a meager meal of cottage cheese and cling peaches --
the 1960s version of the diet plate

He covers the food with a metal dome slides it onto a home-
made dumb waiter and slams the hatch shut He presses the
down button and turns to a wall calendar covered in black

Xs Thursday has been highlighted and marked with dollar
signs

ROGER

INT THE BASEMENT CONTINUOUS

Cold and antiseptic -- its about as cozy as a drug rehab
center Institutional metal furnishings no decorative
intrusions two barred portholes in the wall A shiny
aluminum commode neighbors an equally generic sinkmirror
combo -- they stand nakedly in all their prison-cell glory

A few books -- Homers Odyssey Dantes Purgatorio Joyces
Ulysses Shakespeares Henry V and the Bible rest on a lone
bookshelf A second-hand stringless guitar is chain-linked
to the wall beside a wooden karate practice dummy

A BUZZER sounds noisily as the dumb waiter comes to a halt
The LUMP begins to rustle thrashing about in frustration

Finally it kicks off the blankets and stands in a huff Lo
and behold its

ELVIS PRESLEY

The long-deposed King of Rock and Roll sporting bikini
underpants Now a spirited 62 hes a veritable incarnation
of Jack La Lane -- taut muscles ripped absa shadow of his

former self This Elvis is very much aliveand hes

ELVIS

He hurls the metal cover into the adjacent wall

ELVIS (Contd)

Some day Lois Some day you dang

Elvis desperately tears at his dog collar as he throws a side-
long wary glance at the sophisticated maze of LASER BEAMS
ominously guarding the rickety stairwell

ELVIS (Contd)
Im gonna see you rot in the jailhouse

With that he bum-rushes the stairs his dog collar surges
across the lasers sending an ELECTRIC JOLT through his body

crippling him He crumples and tumbles down the stairs back-
asswards

Slowly he pulls himself from the cold floor

Elvis gawks at the themed-neighborhood that has emerged to
supply the unending demand for Elvis anything --— the
souvenir store tour groups the Lisa Marie Jet

He wipes the smear of drying blood off his face and makes a

half-assed attempt at piling his hair into a pompador then

crosses the street and pauses at the grafitti-covered stone

wall surrounding his property He touches the wall tracing
his finger over the loving words

After a moment he straightens his battered frame and proudly
walks through the famous gate making his ascent up the

driveway - a triumphant Arnold Palmer heading toward the
18th green

He heads through the throngs of tourists and wanderers

holding vigils on his lawn - like Odysseus returning from
sea to find the suitors

He strides up the front walk climbs onto the porch and

stares misty-eyed at his house taking a moment to focus on
