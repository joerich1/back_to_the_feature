FACES IN THE CROWD

by
Julien Magnat

6th of February 2008
FADE IN

As MAIN CREDITS ROLL we glimpse fragments of a woman’s
face A flared nostril a drowsy eyelid a blonde curl
brushing the corner of a mouth The shots are so close we
are unable to get a coherent impression of the face

An alarm clock rings The eyelids flutter and the young
woman wakes

Her hand gropes for the clock on the bedside table weaving
through an empty bottle of mineral water and a framed photo
of a couple on a skiing trip She fumbles with the clock
and finally turns it off

We PULL BACK to reveal

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

-ANNA lazily stirring beneath her quilt clasped in two
male arms BRYCE clean-cut mid-thirties plants a kiss on
her lips

ANNA
(slurrily)
Hi

BRYCE
Hi yourself Havent we met
somewhere before

ANNA
stretching sleepily)
Mmm I don’t know

BRYCE
glancing at alarm
clock)

Late
he suddenly bolts up)
Very late Anna you put the
alarm back again

laughing exasperated)
Damn it

He hurries to the bathroom
BRYCE (0S)
Come on youre gonna be late for
school
Anna glances at the alarm through a mop of dishevelled
hair its 710 She throws herself out of bed
INT BATHROOM - MORNING

Bryce is under the shower his outline blurred by the
frosted glass Anna stands before the mirror
Another series of CLOSE-UPS breaks down her face her
eyelid as she applies a little eye shadow her lips as
she dabs on some gloss

BRYCE (0S)
Stautenmeyer is calling in at the
office this morning I’m gonna
talk to him about my promotion

Anna steps back to take a close look at her reflection
We finally see her in her entirety Thirty or so
Shoulder-length blonde hair Under the make-up she is
pretty in an unassuming way

She notices Bryces watch on the edge of the sink

ANNA
Damn it Im late

BRYCE (0S)
You’ve gotta work on that
Anna

Anna casts a mischievous glance at Bryces outline in the
shower She turns the hot tap full on A second later
Bryce howls

BRYCE (0S)
Hey Not funny

Anna cackles and turns the tap off Bryce steps out the
shower and wraps himself in a towel

BRYCE
Okay slightly funny

Anna grins at him in the mirror as she applies the
finishing touches to her make-up Bryce nudges her aside
and takes her place shaking a can of shaving foam

Anna punches him in the arm playfully Ignoring her Bryce
starts to shave with a cutthroat razor

INT ANNA and BRYCES APARTMENT - MORNING
A spacious apartment more Conran Shop than Ikea

INSERT on the TV tuned to a 24-hour news channel We’re so
close to the set the NEWSREADERs face is a mass of pixels

NEWSREADER
now known as Tearjerk Jack
continues to spread terror across
the East Side

Click Anna squatting in front of the TV skips from
channel to channel from a weather report to a tacky
shopping channel to scenes of a devastating earthquake
before finally stopping on the title sequence of ‘Love
Chains’ a hokey soap opera Much more like it

Anna glances back to check Bryce is still in the bathroom
She grabs the TiVo remote and presses ‘record’

INT CALIFORNIAN MESA - DAY TV SCREEN

The blonde EDEN turns to BRENDAN a dark chiselled hunk
with immovably blow-dried hair who looks at her in a daze

BRENDAN
Eden what are you saying That
you dont love me anymore

EDEN
I’m not sure I thought I did but
everything’s changed

When she hears the water stop running Anna flicks the TV
off and tosses away the remote

A clean-shaven Bryce walks out of the bathroom busy making
a ham-fisted attempt at tying his tie neatly

BRYCE
(wise to her)
Were they the wistful strains of
‘Love Chains’ I just heard

ANNA
(innocence and light)
Not in this apartment--

Anna crosses to Bryce and fixes his tie with the sleight-of-
hand of David Blaine Bryce steps back and strikes a pose

BRYCE
What do you think

ANNA

(kissing his smooth

cheek)
Hmmm I prefer it when it’s a
little rough

(with an amused pout)
But hey maybe Mr Stautenmeyer
and I dont share the same taste

Bryce tuts at Anna’s comment and plucks his coat from the
sofa His eyes flash at the TiVo display box In one swift
move he grabs the remote and cancels the recording

BRYCE
(mock-ominous )
I know what you’re up to

INT SUBWAY TRAIN - MORNING

Anna sits amongst the other bleary-eyed commuters studying
her reflection in the window Beyond this the skyline of a
bustling American city flits past

CLOSE-UP on Annas bag On it is an Anime-style cartoon
next to the logo ‘Manga Girl’

Anna takes out a gossip magazine and idly leafs through it
Next to her a woman reads a newspaper with the headline
‘TEARJERK JACK SLAYS FIFTH’

Anna stops at the horoscope page

ANNA (VO)
Taurus a chance encounter with
a mysterious stranger could be a
bridge to new exciting
opportunities

She looks up at the other passengers eying the men
suspiciously then dives back to her magazine

INT KINDERGARTEN SCHOOL CLASS - MORNING

A lively colorful classroom its windows covered with
bright childrens drawings

Like a conductor before an orchestra Anna surveys her
class painting their self-portraits with riotous glee They
are all dressed in identical navy blue smocks

In the second row a boy dips his dirty brush in the clean
water of a girl who’s the class nuisance She starts
thwacking the little boy

ANNA
Cut that out Veronica Apologize
right now and give Max a kiss

A few rows back a girl with a solemn face finishes a
Surrealist self-portrait

As she pulls back to admire her work she knocks a jar of
water over it She looks up at Anna in dismay eyes filling
with tears

ANNA
(warmly )
It doesnt matter Nora its
nothing to cry about Come on go
fetch the big yellow sponge

Reassured the little girl runs off Annas gaze lingers
over the soaked portrait

EXTREME CLOSE-UP on the portrait the features slowly melt
and disperse into the puddle of water There is something
ominous and unsettling about this like a bad omen
EXT SCHOOL YARD - AFTERNOON

As parents arrive to collect their excitable offspring we
find Anna kneeling in the middle of the yard tying a
LITTLE BOYs shoelaces We notice she wears a bracelet of
painted pasta shells around her wrist When she finishes
the boy pats her on the shoulder and runs off

LITTLE BOY 1
Tag
(to the other kids)
Miss Marchant’s it

All the kids scatter shrieking with excitement Anna
chases after them playing along merrily

A MOTHER walks up to Anna

MOTHER
Hello Im here for--

ANNA
(beating her to it)
-- Robert I think hes playing
in the sand pit

MOTHER
(impressed)
Youre good I dont know how
you tell them apart

The mother heads over to the sand pit The frenzied
ringtone of Anna’s cell phone (Womanizer” by Britney
Spears) suddenly starts ringing in her pocket Anna
discreetly takes the call but before she can speak a
jaded cigarette-charred voice beats her to it

FRANCINE - FILTERED
Hey Supernanny Any hunklicious
divorcees to report Or you too
busy toilet-training their
produce

ANNA

(stifling a chuckle)

Zip it Francine - I’m still on
the clock You coming tonight

FRANCINE - FILTERED
It’s Tuesday right Bet your ass
I am

INT PINSNNEEDLES CLUB - NIGHT

A chilled-out lounge bar Hyper-Modernist cream-leather
booths circle the dance-floor

Anna is sitting at a table between NINA and FRANCINE
Nina is over 40 as slinky as a femme fatale with long
dark wavy hair and a sultry Chilean accent
Francine is single stressed mid-30’s Much to her
despair She wears glasses with thin frames and sports a
stylish if severe bob

The three of them are peering over the heads of the crowded
dance floor ogling something off screen

NINA
Hmmm Six and a half

ANNA
Yeah not bad I’d say a seven

FRANCINE
Look Left of the bar Quick

Adopting their POV we find they are gazing at a pert male
rear in a tight pair of jeans

NINA

Check that out Ten out of ten
ANNA

Not too shabby I must admit
FRANCINE

Hmm -- I wouldnt kick him out of

bed for eating crackers
Or anything else --

Anna turns to Nina
ANNA

So how’d it go with Justin
Timberlake last week

NINA
Had a few drinks Went back to
his need I elaborate

(brushing the memory
away with her hand)
I’ve had more fun with a broken

vibrator
FRANCINE
(jealous)
Does it ever get tiring being a
slut
NINA
I tell you one thing I never get
tired of
(a beat)

That moment you wake up and for a
second you have no idea where you
are or who the hell the guy next
to you is That I love

ANNA

I guess you dont get into a rut
that way Sometimes with Bryce
T--

FRANCINE
Oh dont start on Bryce again
If you done with him hand him
over

Anna bursts out laughing Francine lights her thirtieth
cigarette Nina raises her glass and a mischievous eyebrow

NINA
Well-- Here’s to only 3 more
months til we break out the
thongs on Laguna beach again

Anna rises her glass then ducks her hand her expression
clouding over slightly

ANNA
By the way I have to tell you --
(taking the plunge)
I can’t make it this summer

NINA FRANCINE
What But this is a ritual It’s sacred

ANNA
(smiling tentatively)
Bryce wants us to do Vegas
You know For our first year

together
NINA
(sarcastic)
Classy
FRANCINE
Oh my God-- He’s so gonna pop the
question
ANNA
Hold up -- We’ve just moved in
together
FRANCINE

What are you waiting for To get
dumped for some skanky-ass
cheerleader If he pulls out a
ring you snatch it girl
(slumping in her chair
lost in a reverie)
And when you’ve squeezed out a
couple rug-rats youll fix up
some old rat trap and slide
contentedly into senility

NINA
(archly)
Francine-- for a moment there I
forgot why you’re still single

Anna suddenly sees something off screen and averts her
eyes blushing
ANNA
Oh my god Mister ten out of
ten is totally checking me out

Nina double takes from Anna staring into her drink to the
man off screen and shakes her head in dismay

NINA
Oh well No sense in letting
him go to waste

Nina has already got up from her seat Anna and Francine

astounded see her slink sinuously over to the man and ask
him provocatively for a light The guy invites her to sit

down Nina gives her friends a sly wink and complies

FRANCINE
Hmm Not that hot after all
(downing her drink)
Not my type at all

ANNA
(looking at her watch)
Shit Its late

She stands to leave but Francine grabs hold of her arm

FRANCINE
You can’t leave me stranded in
meat market hell Just one more
come on

EXT STREET BEHIND THE PINSNNEEDLES - NIGHT

Much later Francine very drunk staggers over to a taxi
Anna helps her along holding her arm The street is
deserted

FRANCINE
-You think they’re the problem
don’t you
(pointing at her breasts
accusingly)
You think I should get them done

ANNA
(playfully)
Nah They’re way down the list
Id start with your nose

Anna opens the taxi door and Francine sprawls out on the
back seat

FRANCINE
To Wilcox and third And floor
it
(to Anna)

Come on get in Ill drop you
off
ANNA
Ill be okay Its only a ten-
minute walk

But Francine has already stopped listening

FRANCINE
(to the driver)
Be honest-- Between my nose and
my rack what should I get done

first

Anna swings the door shut stifling a grin The cab sets
off a snatch of Francines red skirt hanging out of the
door

EXT STREETS — DOWNTOWN - NIGHT

Walking alone down a dimly-lit street Anna is just turning
at the corner of a block when the SOUND of WHEELS and
SHOUTS makes her freeze

ANNA
(with a sigh)
Great

From her POV we see a swarm of roller-bladers flitting
down the street Anna has to cross to get home

Deciding not to attempt crossing the incessant flow Anna
turns back toward a steel pedestrian bridge stretching over
the city’s river

EXT BRIDGE ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Part of the bridge is under repair scaffolding conceals
the central section which is wreathed in shadows

Anna hesitates for a second before deciding to cross As
she steps onto the bridge we look down to reveal a
discarded sign lying on the ground DANGER NO ENTRY

EXT BRIDGE UNDER REPAIR - NIGHT

Halfway across the bridge Anna is jarred by some
SUSPICIOUS SOUNDS Anna stops in her tracks hyper-alert
and peers into the darkness

Annas POV we glimpse behind a steel girder a COUPLE
making out His back turned to us the man kisses the
woman’s breasts She giggles drunkenly Neither of them
seems to have heard Anna The man caresses the womans hair
in a sensual manner wrapping it around his hand

Anna looks away embarrassed and continues across the
bridge without making a sound so as not to disturb them

when a SHARP METALLIC SOUND makes her jerk to a halt
The womans giggles come to an abrupt stop Anna turns her
head very very slowly to look back over her shoulder

--and sees the womans body drop onto the metal floor of
the bridge where it lands with a heavy CLANG Her throat
has been slit

A look of utter nauseous terror spreads over Annas face
She stifles a cry by clapping a hand over her mouth

The killer his face in the shadows still hasnt seen
Anna He bends down over the corpse and rips her skirt off
before unzipping his fly

Anna backs away unable to tear her eyes off what happens
next the man squats on top of the dead woman and begins
to thrust faster and faster He climaxes and slumps down
over his victim We then hear the unexpected sound of

SOBBING

Anna takes another step back vanishing into a shadowy
recess that conceals her from the killers eyes when

-’Womanizer’ her cell phone ringtone blasts out
merrily With a terrified start Anna tries to grab the
phone in her bag Too late

Abandoning the corpse the killer gets to his feet his
face is partly in shadow but a shaft of moonlight catches
the tears glistening on his cheek He pauses for a moment —
then bursts into full speed run heading straight for Anna

With a strangled cry Anna starts running as fast as she
can to reach the other end of the bridge

SERIES OF SHOTS - THE PURSUIT Annas clumsy footsteps
hampered by her high heels The mans feet pounding the
metal of the bridge

As she flees in panic Anna rummages in her bag for her
cell which continues to ring loudly She finally grabs it
INSERT on the display ‘BRYCE (CELL)’ Anna takes the call
and opens her mouth to speak

-when one of her heels jams in the grillwork She trips
and falls sprawling on the bridge

INSERT on her phone and her ‘Manga Girl’ bag flying through
the air in SLOW MOTION and scattering across the bridge

ANNA
No
EXT OTHER END OF THE BRIDGE - NIGHT
Annas cries are drowned out by the din of the roller-

bladers who continue to flit past as a police officer
looks on If he’d only turn round

EXT BRIDGE - NIGHT
The killer grabs Anna by the hair
TIGHT on the razor arcing through the air

TIGHT on Anna covering her face with her hand The blade
slices into her palm

Fuelled by fear and pain Anna jerks back with all her
strength The man grabs her blouse but it tears causing
Anna to topple over the side of the bridge

SERIES OF SHOTS - THE FALL Everything spins the bridge
the lights of the city and then BANG Annas head
strikes the iron base of the scaffolding

Everything seems to be in SLOW MOTION now As in a dream
with her hair floating in the air around her Anna sees

the silhouette of her attacker watching her fall
leaning over the bridge But from Annas POV his face
starts to weirdly blur becoming hazy and indistinct
almost hallucinatory (RETURN TO NORMAL MOTION)

REVERSE ANGLE Anna hits the dark surface of the river with
a loud splash and goes under Not a bubble ripples up
Nothing

INSERT on Annas cell phone lying on the ground near her
‘Manga Girl’ bag The killers hand gently picks it up
along with the bag

EXT UNDERWATER - RIVER - NIGHT

With the sound muffled surreal images from the previous
sequences intermingle the childs painting dissolving in
the water the roller-bladers wheels spinning

All the images eventually melt away and we are left looking
up at the tattooed face of a WINO bending over Anna and
pulling her out of the water He says something but his
voice is unintelligible distorted The image whites out

FADE IN
Silence Then against the blinding light we discern a
vague silhouette

INT HOSPITAL ROOM (ONE WEEK LATER) - DAY

The silhouette becomes defined It’s a NURSE who stands
beside Anna fluffing up a bouquet on the bedside table

NURSE
Look at these honey - asphodels
Believe me a gorked-out woman
draws ‘em like flies

A nearby machine starts beeping Anna stirs and gives a
faint moan

Annas POV through the blinding light we see the nurses
outline as she leans over Anna then shuffles out of the
room unconcerned

NURSE (0S)
(seen it all before)
Doctor Myrick Youve got a
customer

INT ANNAS ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY

Bryce Nina and Francine are sitting around Annas bed
their backs turned to us (We do not see their faces yet)

FRANCINE
I cant stand hospitals Birth
death peeing into flasks
yechh
(stressed out)
Nina you got a cigarette

NINA
Sure

BRYCE
(swiping the cigarette
from
Francine’s hand)
Hey

NINA
(sheepishly)
So they’re sure shell be okay

BRYCE
So they tell me They ran all the
tests again this morning

TIGHT on Anna Her eyelids flicker Then open

Annas POV the light is blinding and the image hazy We
nonetheless distinguish the three figures bending over her
Ninas curly hair Francines glasses and Bryces tie

NINA
(her face hazy)
Shes waking up

The image focuses except for the three faces staring at
Anna Their features stretch and twist like the killers
face on the bridge

BRYCE
(his face hazy)
Anna Can you hear me

The image focuses at last and from Annas POV we discover
that the people around her are not Bryce Nina and
Francine They wear the same clothes have the same hairdo
and more or less the same physical appearance but these
people arent them (They are played by different actors
Only their voices remain the same)

ANNA
(freaked out)
Who are you

The new BRYCE - BRYCE 2 - looks at her bewildered

BRYCE 2
Anna -- Its me Bryce

A DOCTOR in a white coat hurries into the room Anna sits
up totally disoriented

ANNA
(grimacing)
My head hurts

BRYCE 2
Everythings fine Nothings
broken You’re a blue-eyed
miracle kid --

Bryce 2 holds his hand out to Annas face but she backs
away in terror

ANNA
Dont touch me
(looking at them)
What do you want from me

The jarringly unknown faces of Nina 2 and Francine 2 lean
over her acting with disturbing familiarity

NINA 2
Its us chica

FRANCINE 2
Dont you recognize us

Her face registering nothing but shock Anna grabs the
doctor’s arm

ANNA
Please You have to call Bryce

The doctor shoots Bryce 2 a concerned look before turning
to Anna with a glibly reassuring smile

DOCTOR
Youve been unconscious for over
a week Your thoughts just need
time to fall back into place

Anna listens to him dazed and sees him pick up a syringe
She panics and swings her legs out of the bed The doctor
tries to hold her down

ANNA
(freaking out)
DONT TOUCH ME

Anna shoves him away with almost maniacal strength before
rushing toward the half-open door Her legs give way Anna
grips the chest of drawers knocking over the asphodels
The vase shatters on the floor

BRYCE 2
Anna Wait

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Dressed only in a hospital gown Anna finds herself in a
long corridor Everything spins around her Holding herself
up against the lacquered wall she staggers along

Two NURSES in white coats walk towards her pushing a metal
trolley whose wheels SQUEAK horribly

From Anna’s POV we linger on them long enough to take ina
strange detail both nurses have the same face like
twins They look at Anna

Anna turns round and sees Bryce 2 and the doctor moving
stealthily along the corridor towards her The doctor holds
Bryce 2 back by his arm

DOCTOR
Easy She’s confused

Feeling trapped Anna dashes through the first door

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

and finds herself in the room of a bedridden OLD MAN who
stares at her in surprise Without thinking Anna darts
into the bathroom seconds before the doctor and Bryce 2
burst into the room

INT BATHROOM - HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Anna bolts the door and backs away out of breath her gaze

locked on the door handle that someone is yanking on
frantically

BRYCE (0S)
Anna Please open the door

DOCTOR (0OS)
(to a nurse)
Where’s the goddamn passkey

Anna takes another step away from the bathroom door She
backs into the washbasin and spins round with a jolt
catching her reflection in a mirror

It isnt her face in the mirror but that of a stranger
(the face of another actress same age same hairstyle)

A harrowing scream erupts from Anna’s mouth and that of the
stranger Anna faints as the door opens to reveal the
nurses The image turns hazy and we

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
INT OFFICE - NEUROLOGY DEPARTMENT - HOSPITAL - DAY

INSERT - a hand slides the photo of a man with an
unremarkable face across a table toward us

NEUROLOGIST (0S)
Take a close look at this
please

Anna slumped on a chair is in her usual clothes again
She stares at the photo with red tired eyes Bryce 2 is
at her side A NEUROLOGIST in thick glasses slips the photo
in a file before showing her a second one

NEUROLOGIST
And this one

Annas POV its the photo of a different man

NEUROLOGIST (0S)
This face have you ever seen it
before

Anna shakes her head The doctor looks meaningfully at
Bryce 2 who seems dazed

NEUROLOGIST
Both photos are of the same man

Anna looks at him blankly unable to comprehend what he’s
saying The neurologist stands to attach a CAT scan X-ray
to a lightboard

NEUROLOGIST
What you’re experiencing are the
symptoms of prosopagnosia

BRYCE 2
Propaso what

NEUROLOGIST
Prosopagnosia Or face blindness
An impairment of face perception
caused by a lesion of the
temporal lobe

(pointing to an area on
the scan)

(MORE )

NEUROLOGIST (contd)
It’s this part of the brain that
in a nanosecond allows us to
compare someone’s face with all
the other faces stored in our
memory

BRYCE 2
(on the edge of his
seat)
Can you dumb it down a little
Doc

NEUROLOGIST

It’s like dyslexia but with faces
instead of letters

(a beat then)
Every time you look at someone’s
face if’s like you’ve never seen
them before Even someone close
Even your own reflection

Anna stares at him as if all this were an absurd dream

BRYCE 2
(turning pale)
How long will it take her to get
over it A week A month

NEUROLOGIST
Confirmed cases of prosopagnosia
are extremely rare We’re talking
2 of the population

(shrugging dismissively)
Anna is probably suffering from
slight cerebral shock The
effects generally vanish in two
weeks

(searching in a drawer)
However if they persist youll
need to see another specialist
for a second opinion

Over this the neurologist hands out a card to Anna but
BRYCE snatches it first

BRYCE 2s POV ‘Dr H Langenkamp — Neuropsychiatrist’

A dazed Anna stares at Bryce 2 as he frowns at the card
with distaste and shoves it as deep as he can into his
raincoat pocket

INT ANNA and BRYCES APARTMENT - EVENING

The apartment is wreathed in the shadows of dusk
The front door opens to reveal Bryce 2 and Anna
Anna uneasy is keeping a certain distance with Bryce 2

BRYCE 2
Twenty-dollar words for stuff
they know nothing about -- thats
psychiatrists for ya

Bryce 2 flicks on the lights but the place still seems
strangely gloomy

BRYCE 2
Had the place cleaned for when
you came back

He turns to Anna stares at her for a long moment and then

BRYCE 2
I really thought I was gonna lose
you you know c’mere --

Bryce 2 puts his arm around Annas waist and kisses her on
the mouth Anna lets him her eyes open trying to get used
to his new face

BRYCE 2
a little nervous)
Getting used to my new looks Are
they an improvement at least

ANNA
uncomfortable)
Yes You look less more
gentle
BRYCE 2

See it’s not all bad

hugging her)

Itll pass youll see
Everything will be like it used
to be

Anna gives him the best smile she can manage and neatens
the messy knot of Bryce 2s tie

ANNA
At least some things never
change

The phone rings startling them both

BRYCE 2
Thatll be your dad He’s been
calling non-stop from some
crackly line in Ecuador
(leaving the room)
Godamnit I told him you need
some time

Bryce 2 marches into the living room loosening the tie
done up by Anna and picks up the phone

BRYCE 2
Hello
(in a more formal tone)
Oh No -- Ive just brought her

home

Anna still in the hallway watches him as he speaks Then
she steps slowly past a partition running the tips of her
fingers over the walls We continue to hear Bryces voice

BRYCE 2 (0S)
I understand but --

Anna reaches a second door that gives onto the living room
and freezes

A MAN with an unfamiliar face is now standing where Bryce
2 was just a second before (Anew actor now plays the
character)

Anna seeks refuge behind the partition gasping for air
she only took her eyes off him for a second

BRYCE 3
Yes If you want No no
Ill bring her in All right

The new Bryce (Bryce 3) hangs up and comes to join Anna
behind the partition

BRYCE 3
Hey everything okay

Anna stunned struggles for composure and nods weakly
Bryce 3 leans forward to kiss her She nervously pulls
away

ANNA
Who was that

BRYCE 3
The police Theres this guy
some Detective He called
before He wants to take your
statement Now

Anna freezes as if she had just recalled the attack She
stares at Bryce 3 with a look of dread

Bryce 3 his eyes suddenly vacant clasps his fingers
through hers He notices her bandaged palm and strokes it
with his thumb

BRYCE 3
(recalling distantly)
You put up a pretty good fight
didn’t you

Anna jerks her hand away an obscene shadow of doubt
flitting across her mind

ANNA
How do you know that

Bryce 3 stares into her eyes lost in unreadable thoughts

BRYCE 3
I called your cell remember
On the bridge I heard things
(defensively sensing
her uneasiness)
I’m the one who called the
police

For a moment Anna seems lost in dark contemplation Then
she brightens and forces a reassuring smile

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT - DOWNTOWN - DAY

A floor where repairs are being done following water
damage Heavy drops fall into buckets that are spread out
around the place Anna and Bryce 3 enter and approach a
FEMALE POLICE OFFICER behind a desk

ANNA
Hello Im Anna Marchant

The officer looks up suddenly awake

FEMALE POLICE OFFICER
This way Miss Marchant

She escorts them down a corridor

When a door is furiously flung open by DETECTIVE SAM
KERREST - mid-40’s rugged sporting a goatee and dark
rings under his eyes that betray too many sleepless nights
He’s gesturing impatiently at two CAPTAINS

KERREST
-Any more internal memos end up
in the Tribune and I’1l
personally tear that son of a
bitch a new --

Kerrest spots Anna and stops in his tracks

KERREST
Miss Marchant correct
(before she can answer)
How’s the head
(zeroing on Bryce)
And youre the boyfriend
I’m Kerrest

Bryce offers his hand but Kerrest is already striding into
a corridor his mind racing ahead

KERREST
This way--

A trickle of water falls from the ceiling and catches
Kerrest full in the eye

KERREST
Goddamit
(gesturing to two
buckets )
Watch your step

Anna and Bryce are about to follow him when LYDIA
Kerrest’s right-hand woman blocks their path She has
piercing eyes and rigidly permed hair in contrast with a
babydoll voice She waves a pile of reports in Kerrest’s
face

LYDIA
(take-no-prisoners )
Uh-uh Youre going nowhere ‘til
you sign this
(turning a page)
-this and this

Kerrest impatiently scribbles his signature on the papers

when his cell rings He has a police siren for a ringtone
Kerrest whips the phone out and slightly self-conscious

angrily hands it to Lydia along with the reports

KERREST
Lydia -- please change that tone

LYDIA
(teasing)
Why don’t you figure it out
yourself detective

She whirls round with a flourish and click-clacks away down
the corridor

INT KERRESTS OFFICE - DAY - LATER

INSERT Kerrests hand pushes a plastic pouch containing
broken pieces of painted pasta shells across the desk

KERREST (0S)
This is all we found on the
bridge

Anna sitting on the other side of the desk with Bryce 3
picks up the pouch and looks at the remains of her
bracelet Opposite her Kerrest shuffles through papers
whips out Anna’s statement and quickly scans it

KERREST
No bag No phone You sure they
didn’t fall with you

Anna nods emphatically a lump in her throat

KERREST
I’m gonna ask you not to cancel
your cell phone contract
(scribbling something in
his notebook)
(MORE )

KERREST (contd)
The asshole’s probably not dumb
enough to use your number but you
never know

ANNA
So-- you’re sure it was him

KERREST
(matter-of-factly)
He killed raped and wept over
the corpse You must know how
he works He’s been front page
news for six months now Theyve
even found a snappy name for him--

ANNA
(tonelessly)
Tearjerk Jack

Anna’s hand fumbles for Bryce 3’s hand

BRYCE 3
(clearing his throat)
Anna saw him Shes in danger
isnt she Aren’t you guys gonna
protect her

Kerrest grabs a thick wad of papers from a drawer and slams
it on the desk

KERREST

This is what we have to wade
through to request police
protection And 20 of these get
dumped on the Chief’s desk every
morning

(a beat then)
Best I can do is get two of my
guys to watch over you --

(frustrated)
Till payroll busts us anyhow

ANNA
(stammering in fear)
He has my papers My address
KERREST

And he’s not stupid He wouldn’t
go anywhere near the one person
who could recognize him Right

Anna shivers That’s exactly the problem
She opens her mouth to say something anything but Kerrest
beats her to it

KERREST
Listen Im sorry you had to meet
this years whackjob You wanna
feel safe Help me catch the evil
sonofabitch

Kerrest returns to her statement kicking back into gear

KERREST
Ok What youve told me here --
35-40 dark hair slim
I ain’t letting you walk outta
here ‘til you give me more than
that

ANNA
(the memory flashing
back)
The homeless guy The homeless
guy who fished me out-- He must
have seen him too

KERREST
(dismissive)
More vodka than blood in him
Couldn’t give us a damn thing
(leans in)
It all boils down to this Did
you or did you not see his face

Anna looks away intimidated by Kerrests intense gaze

ANNA
Yes but --

KERREST
Okay Good You did see him

Kerrest whips open a thick file in front of Anna Inside
are a series of black and white mug-shots

KERREST
Look at them all carefully And
take your time

Anna looks at Bryce 3 then at the photos as awkward as
at the hospital Everyone holds their breath as the room
falls silent

INT CORRIDOR UNDER REPAIR — POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

A couple of UNIFORMED COPS at the coffee machine look up as
Bryce 3 hurries out into the corridor escorting Anna
towards the exit Kerrest is right behind them extremely
annoyed

KERREST
This is bullshit You haven’t
even looked at half of these

ANNA
I keep telling you I cant
remember his face Ever since the
accident I

Bryce 3 shoots her a look saying Dont say anything

BRYCE 3
Anna’s just got out of hospital
She needs rest

KERREST

(exploding to Bryce)
Rest Go tell that to the six
girls whose throats he opened
from ear to ear

(to Anna angry)
So please forgive me for rattling
you but I’d rather the next time
we meet you weren’t lying on a
slab

ANNA
(exploding in turn)
Look I CANT RECOGNIZE FACES
ANYMORE OKAY

Silence The whole floor turns to look at Anna Bryce 3
looks away visibly pained

KERREST
(dumbstruck)
You what

ANNA
(touching her head)
Since the accident I

Anna notices something that distracts her for a second the
group of uniformed cops staring at her from the coffee
machine -like the nurses earlier- all have the same face

ANNA
The guy could be right here in
front of me and I wouldnt
recognize him You understand
(more sure of herself)
So dont waste your time trying
to scare me Believe me I

already am

Anna turns her back on him Kerrest is about to start after
her but Bryce steps in

BRYCE 3
Call the hospital Theyll
explain

Kerrest fumes Two plain clothes officers walk past him
One fat one skinny CARPENTER the skinny one is eating a
burger

KERREST
(barking at them)
You two Where are you going

CARPENTER
(through a mouthful)
We’re on lunch

Kerrest snatches the thin guy’s sandwich and takes a big
chunk then

KERREST
Not anymore You’re on
surveillance
(chin-indicating Anna)
Don’t let her out of your sight

The two cops roll their eyes at one another Terrific

INT CAFETERIA — POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

A spacious room with no windows lit by neon lights The
atmosphere is muted and subterranean

CLOSE-UP on the hand of a child drawing something with a
felt pen on a large sheet of paper The artist - a LITTLE
BOY with a solemn face - looks up

Sitting opposite him is LANYON - a pleasant-looking man
about the same age and build as Kerrest He looks at the
boy blankly — then pulls a crazy face to make the kid
laugh

But the boy keeps staring at him gravely In the bg the
door opens to reveal Kerrest still in a foul mood

KERREST
Hey Lanyon Ive been trying to
reach you for the last two hours

Over this Kerrest pumps a dollar in a soda machine and
proceeds to slam it when no can is forthcoming

LANYON
Wednesday Nicholas No cell

Kerrest nods at the kid The kid just stares back at him

KERREST
Guess who woke up and just walked
in Anna Marchant

As he bangs the machine one last time it finally spits out
a soda

KERREST
(sulky)
I wanted diet coke
Kerrest crosses over to sit at their table

LANYON
So what’s the story Any leads

KERREST
Its a bit complicated
(signalling to him to
step to one side)
Can we talk

Lanyon turns to Nicolas with an affectionate smile

LANYON
Why don’t you go grab a soda
Nicky

INT CAFETERIA — POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER

Standing before the soft-drinks machine Nicholas sips from
a can of soda through a straw

A short distance away at the table Kerrest and Lanyon
speak in low voices so as not to put the child on edge

LANYON
(processing it all)
So this face blindness Is it
temporary or permanent

KERREST
(frustrated)
They’ve got no freakin’ idea

Lanyon thinks it over and then gives a little chuckle

KERREST
(stonily)
And you think its funny

LANYON
Well --She’s the only one whos
seen him and she cant recognize
anybody You gotta admit it’s
pretty far out

Kerrest gives a weary sigh and looks down absently at the
child’s drawing on the table It shows a man with a
disturbing grimace and tears rolling down his face

KERREST
How’s the kid doing

LANYON
(concerned)
Still hasn’t uttered a word

Kerrest looks at his colleague with respect then sits back
and kneads his brow

KERREST
No ID No leads Jorgensen in
forensics even pushed a trace on
the tear sample through the FBI’s
DNA database And nada The guy’s
a frickin’ ghost

(imploringly )
(MORE )

KERREST (contd)
You’re the mind reader with the
fancy diploma --

LANYON
(ruminating)
You know what I think

KERREST
(half-convinced)
The melancholy killer theory

LANYON
A guy who has to kill women to be
able to touch them that’s sad --

(coldly stating)

He weeps because his sexual
compulsions disgust him He only
kills so that they won’t see him
as he truly is

KERREST
But Anna Marchant saw him

LANYON
And she survived
(he thinks for a second)
I think he’s gonna be really
interested in her

KERREST

(visibly worried)
Well we’ve got her insulated for
now

(bolts up itching for

action)
I’m gonna head down to the
mission have another crack at
the hobo

LANYON
Good luck We got nothing outta
him but sea shanties

KERREST
Maybe he’s dried out Beats
pacing around the office getting
dripped on

EXT SUBWAY EXIT - MORNING

A misty morning We see the steps of a subway station with
the stations name above ‘LAGUNA BEACH’

Annas head appears climbing the steps in slow motion
dressed in a billowing wedding dress

From her POV the passers-by flit past at top speed like
ghosts their faces erased and indiscernible

Anna looks down gallons and gallons of water are pouring
from the bottom of her dress It cascades down the steps

Anna tries to cry out but water pours from her mouth

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Anna wakes up with a start Bryce is sleeping on his side
his face in shadow Anna slips out of bed

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Anna splashes water over her face then lifts her head to
gaze at her reflection

-but its her own face she sees in the mirror Surprised
she stares at her reflection for a second She takes a deep
breath and holds her hand out to touch it

when a leather-gloved hand holding a gleaming razor
shoots into frame and slits her throat

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

Anne awakes sitting bolt-upright on the bed for real
this time She touches her throat with a trembling hand
before falling back against her pillow gasping for breath

BRYCE (0S)
Hi there Havent we met
somewhere before

The lips of a total stranger enter the frame to kiss her
Unsettled Anna flinches and pulls away before realizing
this is just another Bryce

BRYCE 4
You OK

ANNA
(struggling for
composure)

Yeah-- Just a bad dream

She sits on the edge of the bed Bryce 4 gently runs his
hand through her hair

BRYCE 4
They need me at the office this
morning but if you want I--

ANNA
(hurriedly)
No no go to work Everythings
fine

Bryce 4 leans over to kiss her Anna turns her head so
that the kiss lands on her cheek

EXT OUTSIDE ANNA’S BUILDING - MORNING

From a distance we see Bryce pacing out of the building
busy texting something on a small cell

We PULL BACK to reveal we’re inside a car Craven and
Carpenter are watching the entrance

CRAVEN
There goes the boyfriend

CARPENTER
Stuck-up asshole

INT LIVING ROOM - DAY

Anna is waxing her legs in her bathrobe talking on a
cordless phone pressed between her ear and shoulder
Filtering through the loudspeaker we hear the deep hoarse
tobacco-strapped voice of her father

ANNA
Yeah I do miss the children
I spoke to Mr Barker earlier
Im going back on Wednesday
So is it sunny in Argentina

ANNAS FATHER (VO)
Perfect weather for a gaucho
Isnt Wednesday a bit soon

ANNA
Everythings fine Dad Theres
nothing --
(she hesitates for a
second then goes on)
-- nothing wrong with me

Over this Anna parts the blinds with two fingers

From her POV we see the surveillance car below Two plain
clothes cops are sitting in the front From their
distinctive physiques we recognize them as CRAVEN 2 and
CARPENTER 2 The latter nods at Anna

Anna is about to wave back but a truck rolls across and
after it’s passed Carpenter’s face looks different
(Carpenter 3) Somehow more sinister

REVERSE ON Anna anxiety clouding her face She recoils
from the blinds the phone between her ear and shoulder

ANNA
- Nothing wrong except I’1l go
nuts if I spend another day stuck
in here

ANNAS FATHER (VO)
I’1l be in town for a convention
on Thursday How ‘bout dinner
with the old man

ANNA
Sounds great Why don’t you come

Anna grimaces as she tears a wax strip from her leg

ANNAS FATHER (VO)
Okay Any delays Ill call you

ANNA
Hold on my old cell is either
sleeping with the fishes or ina

madman’s pocket I’m using
Bryce’s old cell You got his

Over this Anna glances at Bryces chunky Blackberry lying
on the tiled floor

ANNAS FATHER (VO)
I have it We’ve got a lot to
catch up on Take care

snowflake

ANNA
You too Dad See you Wednesday
Love you

She hangs up her eyes fixed on Bryce’s cell She picks it
up and presses the directory button

INSERT on the cell phone display The first name to appear
on the alphabetical list is ‘ANNA - CELL’

Anna hesitates for a beat and punches in the call
button

The phone at the other end starts ringing

Anna cannot breathe A second ring Anna knows she
should hang up but driven by morbid curiosity she waits
feverishly A third ring The tension’s at its peak
when

-RIIING Anna jolts out of her skin and switches off the
phone Someone’s just rung the doorbell

Anna hesitates She darts over to the blinds and looks down
at the car below her

Anna’s POV The two cops are not inside
As Anna scans the screen anxiously we spot them at a
hotdog stand slathering mustard on two foot-long

ANNA
Shit

INT HALLWAY —- APARTMENT —- DAY

Anna walks warily over to the front door The bell rings
again Anna takes a deep breath and peers through the
spyhole in the door

Annas POV the grotesquely distorted face of an UNFAMILIAR
WOMAN stares at her through the spyhole

ANNA (0S)
Who is it

The face of a SECOND WOMAN then suddenly appears in front
of the first

SECOND WOMAN
(with a Latino accent)
Its us chica Open up

We immediately recognize Ninas voice So the other woman
must be Francine Anna opens the door relieved The two

strangers stroll casually into the apartment like they’ve
done hundreds of times before

NINA 3
Hi sleeping beauty
(pulling a funny face)
Know who we are this time

ANNA
(lying awkward)
Of course I’m fine now I was
just a bit -- zoned out

FRANCINE 3
(shaking a newspaper)
Look - you made the front page
Youre famous hon

Anna grabs the newspaper and scans the story

ANNA

The girl that got away A key
witness in the Tearjerk Jack
investigation has been questioned
by police upon being released
from hospital

(turning pale)
Are they out of their minds

Anna whizzes through the article looking concerned
Francine 3 realizes she’s goofed Nina 3 nudges her
Francine 3 rummages through her handbag

FRANCINE 3
(thrusting a DVD case in
Annas face)
Ta-da Love Chains I downloaded
every show you missed while you
were playing dead

Anna looks up from the newspaper For the first time since
the accident a smile brightens her face

INT LIVING ROOM and KITCHEN CORNER - DAY

FRANCINE 3 slips the hand-labelled disc into the DVD
player while Nina 3 on the couch pops a lit cigarette
between Annas lips as if it were a thermometer

ANNA
I dont smoke

NINA 3
(silkily)
Its high time you started

Anna hesitantly takes a drag

FRANCINE 3
(excitable)
Here we go

The soap operas theme tune blasts out
The three friends snuggle up together on the couch their
eyes glued to the screen The sequence is intercut with

INT CALIFORNIAN MESA - DAY

On the TV screen Eden has her back to the camera MASON a
silver-maned man in his fifties enters

MASON
Eden Where were you I was
looking for you all night

FRANCINE (0S)
T’t That conniving skank has
been off screwing Jack again

ANNA and NINA (0S)
Shh

On the TV screen Eden turns languorously to the camera
She is no longer played by the same actress

EDEN 2
I went to see the church youve
chosen for our wedding
Annas smile fades

ANNA
Theyve recast Eden

Francine 3 and Nina 3 look at each other bemused

FRANCINE 3
Yeah like 10 seasons ago Duh

Anna unsettled turns back to the TV screen In the
meantime another actor has replaced Mason

MASON 2
I wanted it to be a surprise
baby

Reverse angle on Eden Her face has changed again (the
actors change with each reverse angle shot)

EDEN 3
Its beautiful oh Mason I
love you so much

Anna tense picks up the remote and rewinds the disc on
the screen the actors return at top speed to their initial
positions

Anna presses ‘pause’ just as Eden turns round then with
the ‘rewind’ key makes her turn round once twice three
times Each time Edens face changes becoming colder and
almost malevolent

Nina 3 and Francine 3 exchange a confused look

NINA 3
Anna what are you doing

Anna feeling breathless leaps to her feet and hurries
out

ANNA
B-be right back

INT HALLWAY - APARTMENT —- DAY

Her eyes closed Anna tries to calm herself down When she
opens her eyes she finds herself gazing at Bryces coat

She hurriedly checks the pocket and retrieves the card the
doctor gave them ‘Dr H Langenkamp - Neuropsychiatrist’

INT WAITING ROOM - DAY

Anna is sitting on the edge of her chair biting her nails
Her eyes fall on a poster tacked to the wall ‘When the
brains unwell life aint swell’

The bland ringtone of Bryces cell phone makes her start

ANNA
(hurriedly answering)
Hello Bryce No Im uh --
(thinking up an alibi)
-- at the bank

We hear voices coming from the doctors office

ANNA
I have to go now Ill call you
later Bye

The door opens to reveal the previous appointments
patients a YOUNG GIRL WITH DOWNS SYNDROME gripping her
MOTHERs arm The girl stares at Anna with a dazed
expression

Anna suddenly feels stifled She grabs her coat and heads
for the door when

DR LANGENKAMP (0S)
Miss Marchant

EXT CARDBOARD CITY UNDER THE BRIDGE - DAY
The wino who fished out Anna is sprawled on the ground
wrapped in newspapers swigging from a bottle wrapped in a

filthy bag and wailing a drunken shanty

From his lopsided POV we see a pair of smartly shod feet
stepping into view

The wino’s tattooed face looks up half interested It’s
Kerrest (same actor since Anna isnt present)

KERREST
You gave me quite a ride old
boy Why aren’t you at the
mission

WINO
(picking at a scab)
It’s dirty there

The wino sits up and takes another swig Kerrest throws a
quick glance around the place Just a few crumpled old men
strewn around No one paying attention

KERREST
It might not be the Savoy but
it’s safe Anything could happen
to you down here

WINO
What do you care

The wino spits a glob of yellow phlegm at Kerrest’s feet
and goes to take another swig
Kerrest swiftly blocks the bottle top with one finger

KERREST
(direct)
I’ve got some questions and this
time I really need the answers

INT DR LANGENKAMPS OFFICE - DAY

A warm organic atmosphere Anna sitting in an armchair
lets her gaze drift skeptically over all kinds of Hindu and
African artefacts on the shelves

Behind her desk DR LANGENKAMP - her wiry silver hair
barely contained in a bun- holds out the x- rays of Annas
brain to examine them The ethnic jewelry around her neck
makes her look more like a healer than a doctor

The doctors eyes meet Annas through the negative scan

ANNA
Do you see anything

DR LANGENKAMP
(checking the negative)
No It just reminds me of ‘Europe
After the Rain’ by Max Ernst
(looking at Anna)
What was I supposed to see

exactly

ANNA
Well if I really have proso
propaso

DR LANGENKAMP
Prosopagnosia You tell me
(puts the negative down)
Can you see peoples faces or
not

ANNA
Of course I can see their faces
It’s just that --
(grudgingly)
-- they just keep changing all
the time

DR LANGENKAMP
So you have the answer to your
question
(holds a box out to her)
Cinnamon candy

ANNA
(trying not to lose it)
But It can be treated right

There’s gotta be some medication--

DR LANGENKAMP
Face blindness isnt something
you just catch Miss Marchant
Rather its something you lose

ANNA
(her world crumbling)
Wait-- Are you saying I’m stuck
like this forever

DR LANGENKAMP

(with great patience)
Miss Marchant -- Out of one
hundred faces you will maybe
recognize one or two at best

(with an apologetic

smile)
But Im afraid youd better get
used to people’s faces changing
as soon as you lose sight of
them

Anna seems shocked as much by this information as by the
doctors apparent nonchalance She bolts up from her seat

ANNA
You don’t understand-- I just
want my old life back

DR LANGENKAMP
(sympathetic)
I can’t give you that but I can
help you cope with your
impairment But you’1ll have to
relearn everything from scratch
Like a rebirth of sorts

ANNA
(forcing a nervous
laugh)
Right I think I’ve had enough
New Age bullshit for one day

Anna strides to the door The doctor simply watches her go
motionless Anna slams the door behind her

INT LANDING and ELEVATOR - DAY

Anna has already closed the gate of the elevator when Dr
Langenkamp peers down from the landing getting smaller as
the lift heads down

DR LANGENKAMP (0S)
Faces are the barcode of the
human race Ever since mankind
went tribal we’re constantly
checking other people’s faces to
try and decide if they’re
friends foes or lovers --

(ominously)
Don’t underestimate the
seriousness of your condition
Miss Marchant

Anna listens to the doctor’s words the shadows of the
elevators wrought iron bars passing over her face

EXT CARDBOARD CITY UNDER THE BRIDGE - DAY

The wino is belting out doggerel at the top of his lungs
Kerrest rolls his eyes skyward

WINO
In heaven there’s no beerLet’s
drink it all right heeeere

KERREST
OK You feel like remembering and
there’s a bottle of Jack Daniels
in it for you

Kerrest tucks a 20 and his business card in the wino’s top
pocket gives him a friendly pat on the arm and walks off

The wino reaches into his pocket and with haughty disdain
tosses Kerrest’s card away He then slumps back on his
side

A beat then from his lopsided POV we see smart shoes -
that may or may not belong to Kerrest - step into view

WINO
(slurrily)
What do you want now y--

Steel flashes A jet of viscous blood sprays over Kerrest’s
card

INT BEDROOM - MORNING

arms of a snoring stranger (Bryce 5)

The alarm clock goes off Anna turns it off Her gaze falls
for a second on a framed photo near the clock

the skiing holiday photo

Bryce 5 stretches behind her and kisses her Anna forces
herself to accept the kiss but gets out of bed straight
after

Bryce 5 watches her slip into the bathroom

BRYCE 5
Want me to come with you

Theres no reply Bryce 5 gets out of bed rubbing his
head his back to us

BRYCE 5
(from behind)
By the way what were you doing

The only reply is the sound of the shower in the

us) looks for Anna’s handbag Hesitates Grabs it and
rummages inside

INSERT on his hand as he pulls out Dr Langenkamps card
with ‘Saturday 330 scribbled on it

in the mirror With a shaking hand she applies mascara to

Over this the avian dim of EXCITED CHILDREN fades in

INT KINDERGARTEN CLASSROOM - MORNING

Anna standing at her desk takes a thick marker and some
colorful stickers out of her drawer

Annas POV sitting at their desks in their identical
smocks the children all seem to have the same face (CGI
effect) It is almost impossible to tell them apart

act as if everything were normal

want you to come up to my desk
one by one
(opening her register)
Caroline Beasley

A little girl runs up to her Anna writes ‘CAROLINE’ on the

random)

We SWISH PAN over to the face of an identical child

Oh yes Sandra Sandra

No better off Anna looks around at her class of identical
children As her eyes move around the room her gaze is
drawn to a window

Across the yard half-concealed by the trees a MAN is
staring at Anna He’s wearing a very vivid orange shirt

In the third row an IMP with a buzz-cut tosses the
contents of his neighbors pencil case in the air with a
scream

Anna turns to the child with a start before glancing over
at the window again The man in the orange shirt has
vanished

Anna unsettled turns back to her class A smiling FATHER
peers around the door Anna opens her mouth to say
something when a boy races over and leaps into the mans
arms much to her relief

Sandras mother turns to Anna again

rush Wheres my daughter

He sighs and absently rubs his face with his hand When he
lowers his hand again his face has changed (MR BARKER 2)

Anna clenches her fists but decides not to defend herself

Annas eyes run up a black and white collar to the face of
a kind-looking middle-aged PRIEST

face of Chanel celebrities with unfamiliar faces
Anna stops at the horoscope page

Where are you exactly

window)
Line 4 Heading for Harlin

KERREST

Whatever you do stay on the
train With people around you
Im gonna--

(click)

Hello

ANNA

Hello

Anna glances at her cell display she’s lost the
connection She slowly turns round to study the other
passengers Behind any seemingly bland face could lurk the
sick abhorrent mind of the killer

Her eyes once again meet those of the PRIEST 2 (now played
by another actor) who nods at her politely

Behind Anna we suddenly see the man with the orange shirt
standing in the adjacent compartment (we cannot see his
face) He knocks on the glass of the door separating them
as if to catch her full attention

Anna turns round and seeing him immediately looks away
just as the train enters a station

Terrified Anna doesn’t know what to do

The door opens with a hydraulic hiss Anna hesitates
Then steps off the train

INT CRAVEN and CARPENTER’S CAR OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL - DAY

Craven is on the radio with Kerrest Carpenter slams a red
siren on the roof and peels out They both look like
whipped dogs

KERREST - FILTERED
Harlin Harlin Get your asses
down there now if you wanna keep
your pension

INT PLATFORM and CORRIDORS - SUBWAY - DAY

Anna finds herself on the platform in the swarm of
onrushing commuters She sets off with them down a
connecting passage

The man in the orange shirt has also left the train and
sets after her quickening his pace

Anna nervously speeds up too Behind her the man in the
orange shirt starts running

Losing her cool Anna sprints along the corridor shoving
past people as she goes She takes another passage
hesitates then clambers up the escalator

INT SECOND SUBWAY PLATFORM and COMPARTMENT - DAY

She finds herself on another platform The train is at a

stop with its doors open Anna hops on board She hears

the beep indicating the doors are closing The beep seems
to get louder and louder

ANNA
(through her teeth)
Come on close damn you

Just as the doors slowly close the outline of the man in
the orange shirt rushes onto the platform and leaps
into the next compartment at the last second

Anna trapped hurries to the next compartment toward the
front of the train

SERIES OF JERKY STEADICAM SHOTS - THE CHASE

Anna runs through the compartments shoving past
passengers

Through the windows the lights of the tunnel strobe on the
outline of the man in the orange shirt gaining on her

Anna passes through another compartment stumbling as the
train rocks

INT FRONT COMPARTMENT - DAY
Anna reaches the empty front compartment - a dead end

Gasping for breath she whirls round to see the man in the
orange shirt enter this compartment the light behind
him rendering him in silhouette just as the train enters
a station

In desperation Anna smashes the glass case of the
emergency brake with her bandaged hand All the lights go
out and the train jolts to a halt with a teeth-rattling
SCREECH

INSERT in another compartment all the passengers are sent
sprawling

Anna is thrown to the floor The man in the orange shirt 6
barely grabs onto the metal pole

ANNA
(in terror)
Keep the hell away from me

The man opens his mouth to speak when

CARPENTER (0S)
Freeze

The doors of the compartment swish open on two gun-wielding
cops one thin one fat - CRAVEN 4 and CARPENTER 4 -

They pounce on the man in the orange shirt 6 and slam him
to the ground

The man looks at Anna in panic We see him clearly for the
first time he is just a frightened man in his fifties

MAN IN THE ORANGE SHIRT 6
Anna Its me

Anna freezes on hearing the sound of this familiar husky
tobacco-strapped voice Craven 4 and Carpenter 4 taken
aback stare at him then at Anna

MAN IN THE ORANGE SHIRT 6

You told me to meet you for
dinner after school I saw you
race into the subway I thought
something was wrong

(struggling with the two

officers)
For God’s sake Snowflake are
you scared of me now

Anna pushes the two cops aside and throws her arms around
the mans neck
ANNA
I’m so sorry Dad
INT BATHROOM —- DAY
The door opens to reveal a weary-looking Anna She sets her
‘Manga Girl’ bag down on the sink then frantically starts
rummaging through a drawer
INSERT her hand takes out a colored plastic button
Anna picks up her ‘Manga Girl’ bag and opens it

INSERT there is a button missing from the inside pocket

Annas trembling fingers check to see if the button matches
the one opposite It’s beyond doubt This is her bag

Anna overwhelmed looks at her reflection in the mirror

JUMP-CUT the light has changed Anna is still in front of
the mirror a glazed vacant look on her face

Absently picking up a wipe she starts removing the make-up
from the tired-looking stranger in the mirror Her hand
trembles and leaves a long smear of lipstick Bitter tears
well up in the strangers eyes Tears Anna’s held back all
day

She suddenly starts smearing make-up over this unbearable
face kneading it with both hands twisting it as if to
erase it in vain Anna enraged strikes the mirror with
her fist once twice It shatters

Anna looks down at the shards of glass and sees 100
different faces staring back at her They all start
screaming in unison

MONTAGE A SERIES OF SHOTS AROUND THE APARTMENT

Anna striding furiously around the apartment shatters all
the other mirrors with a pan as glass rains down around
her then all the framed photos the photo of her and
Bryce on their skiing holiday on the bedside table

CLOSE-UP on the pages of a photo album as Annas hands
angrily leaf through it young unknown blondes have taken
her place in her past Anna frenziedly tears them up

-then drops the pieces in the sink splashes them with
vodka and drops a lit match on them

As black flames rise up from the sink Anna sweeps a row of
videotapes marked ‘LAGUNA BEACH’ from a shelf Then
picking up one of them she rips out yards and yards of
tape In the end she collapses on the floor utterly
burned out

The front door opens Anna turns round and sees Bryce 6
walk into the apartment briefcase in hand Dumbstruck he
gapes at the flames in the sink then at Anna huddled on
the floor her face smeared with make-up

BRYCE 6
Anna

ANNA
(her voice cracked)
I cant do this I cant

Bryce 6 drops his briefcase and runs into the living room
kneeling down to take Anna in his arms

We PULL BACK to frame the two of them lost in the middle
of the battleground that their living room has become

FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
INT LANDING and DOCTORS OFFICE - DAY

Anna rings the doorbell A lengthy silence The door then
opens to reveal an elderly woman

ANNA
Hello is Dr Langenkamp

Anna doesnt finish the question she has just recognized
the new DR LANGENKAMP 2 from the necklaces that she wears

DR LANGENKAMP 2
(smiling)
Hello Miss Marchant

ANNA
Forgive me its silly I

Anna gives a short impulsive laugh then she looks at the
doctor solemnly the laughter gone

ANNA
Everything you said last time
you were right

INT DR LANGENKAMPS OFFICE - DAY

Anna sits in an armchair in the middle of the room

Dr Langenkamp 2 walks over to the windows and draws the
curtains one by one creating a warm and reassuring
atmosphere

DR LANGENKAMP 2
When I was 16 I had two passions
in life horse-riding and opera
I dreamt of being the new
Callas until a horse threw me
head-first into a brick wall
(MORE)
DR LANGENKAMP 2 (contd)
(she looks at Anna)
The accident left me deaf and I
had to rule out an operatic
career

ANNA
(blinking at her)
Youre deaf

DR LANGENKAMP 2
As a post I have to read your
lips to know what youre saying --

Anna cant believe this she hadnt noticed anything

DR LANGENKAMP 2

-- But I can still hear Wagner
playing I just have to close
my eyes and listen

(with an enigmatic

smile)
You too must learn how to find
your inner music

ANNA
(disappointed)
Sorry but I dont understand

Dr Langenkamp 2 perches on the edge of her desk

DR LANGENKAMP 2

People are always going on about
sight hearing and smell
But theres another sense a
hidden one that coordinates all
the others The Japanese call
it Muga Its the sense that
allows you to walk without
thinking about putting one foot
in front of the other

(turning to Anna)
Lose it and you’1l lose your
soul you’ll end up like some of
my patients socially paralyzed
withdrawing from the world into
the safety of isolation It’s a
tempting option-

ANNA
(shaking a definite no)
N-no I want to live normally

Dr Langenkamps face becomes stern foreboding

DR LANGENKAMP 2
Every day people will resent you
for failing to recognize them --
They’11l call you rude forgetful
retarded or a liar --

(sizing her up)

Are you ready to fight back with
all your might

ANNA
(weakly)
Yes

DR LANGENKAMP 2
-- Ready to try and try again
Without losing heart or giving an
inch

ANNA
(more determined)
Yes

The doctors grim expression turns into a satisfied smile

DR LANGENKAMP 2
Good Then lets get to work

Dr Langenkamp 2 dips her hand into a bowl of gemstones on
her desk She picks out a couple at random that she shows
to Anna holding one in each hand between her thumb and
forefinger

DR LANGENKAMP 2
Allow me to introduce ‘Mike’ and
‘Maggy’ Not easy to tell them
apart at first sight is it

INSERT the two stones look identical

DR LANGENKAMP 2
However Mike and Maggy are very
different Take a closer look

Tighter CLOSE UP on the stones ‘Maggy’ is a paler green
than ‘Mike’ with a faint mark on one side

DR LANGENKAMP 2
Maggy is a little paler dont
you think And she has a little
scar here too on her forehead

Anna nods bemused Dr Langenkamp 2 returns Mike and Maggy
to the bowl with the other stones

DR LANGENKAMP 2
It gets more complicated when you
have to find Mike and Maggy at a
party among all the other
guests
(a beat then)
You’re going to learn to focus on
distinctive features in people
Things like hair gait voice
clothes perfume Anything
that’s not face-related and that
you’re naturally sensitive to
(leaning towards Anna)
Whats the first thing you look
at in aman after his face

ANNA
(repressing a smirk)
With my friends we note their
butts

DR LANGENKAMP 2
(with a salacious
twinkle)
What else would you look at

With a flourish Dr Langenkamp 2 spreads the bowl of green
gemstones over the table

DR LANGENKAMP 2
Lets see

Hovering above the table Dr Langenkamps hand hesitates at
first between several light-colored stones

DR LANGENKAMP 2
This one has a pale complexion
And a faint scar on her forehead
(with a victorious cry)
It must be Maggy

- then picks ‘Maggy’ Tosses it to Anna who catches it
and takes a closer look A faint smile appears on her lips

Dr Langenkamps soothing voice continues over the following
montage

INT PINSNNEEDLES BAR - EVENING

In the bg we can hear hypnotic lounge music pulsing away
The door opens to reveal Anna looking a little nervous

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
First of all you need allies
Start with the people you trust
the most

Anna glances around the bar looking for Nina and Francine

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Arrange to meet in a familiar
setting but one with a crowd

The bar is packed No sign of Nina or Francine Anna takes
a deep breath and starts scrutinizing the bars customers

DR LANGENKAMP
Unfortunately you’1ll discover
that everyone is trying to look
like everyone else these days

The camera lingers over the clubbers who are all dressed
in a similar manner they all have the same face

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
The uniforms-- the blind sheep --
the suits -- Theyll all have the
same face for you

(snorting)
And frankly they’re all boring
as hell--

From Annas POV we dart from one face to another through
the colorful crowd Its a playful moment because we are
using the doctors advice to try to guess where Nina and
Francine might be

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Look for distinguishing markers
Moles scars tattoos gappy
teeth facial hair Anything
that stands out will make the
face easier to identify

Annas gaze lingers over a brunette with curly hair Nina
with a new face

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Of course there are no rules
youll just have to find the
thing that works best for
yourself

The brunette turns and stares at us as if to say Whats
your problem We then move over to a nearby table where a
woman is sitting From behind she could be a ‘Francine’

Anna hesitates and steps slowly closer At that point a
second woman who could well be a ‘Nina’ joins the first
Anna hesitates a while longer looks at them and starts

smiling She walks towards them with renewed confidence

The two strangers turn to her with big smiles

FRANCINE 4
About time

NINA 4
(Chilean accent)
You okay chica

Anna sits down with a look of relief
FRANCINE 4
(dying to hear the news)

So whats this earth-shattering

thing you have to tell us
Anna intimidated takes a deep breath and makes the
plunge
INT ANNA’S APARTMENT - DAY

Like every morning Anna straightens the knot of Bryce 7s
tie before they part for the day

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Were going to reorganize your
daily life with the help of tiny
practical ploys that will help
you get through the day

BRYCE 7
It starts at seven
Want me to come and get you

ANNA
(her gaze focused on his
tie)
Nah Ill meet you there

Bryce7 is a little taken aback by her newfound confidence

BRYCE 7
Okay
(quickly kissing her)
Ill see you later then

He hurries off clearly late As soon as he’s out of sigh
Anna whips out a small diary from her bag Using crayons
she starts drawing something on one of the pages

INT BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Anna steps into the bathroom and looks defiantly at the
stranger in the mirror

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
As soon as someones appearance
changes however slightly you’1ll
find their face changing too

Anna starts doing her hair trying different kinds of make-
up With each change (JUMP CUTS) a new unfamiliar face
appears in the mirror

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
So try to look on the bright
side

Anna now plays along changing her face like someone trying
on a new dress

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
-If you look like Ugly Betty
today you could be Cameron Diaz
tomorrow

Anna satisfied with the face that she has just obtained by
doing up her hair pokes her tongue out at her reflection
before leaving the room dressed in a sexy cocktail dress

INT LOBBY - START-UP - EVENING

A chic reception organized by the start-up where Bryce
works

Anna strides into the lobby looking dazzling in her black
cocktail dress She looks around

The place is crammed with men in suits and ties some with
their girlfriends or wives Once again they all seem to
have the same face

Anna discreetly takes out her small diary and speedily
leafs through it

INSERT on each page Anna has drawn the tie that Bryce
wears each day in crayon Todays tie is an elegant wine-
red one with grey stripes and a pattern

Annas POV we rove through the crowd of executives without
seeing their faces comparing their ties Unfortunately
the tie of the day must be very ‘in’ because several men
have a similar one

A little confused Anna then starts looking at their butts
She focuses on a rather convincing one then looks up to
decipher his bland generic face Is it Bryce

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Your brain can no longer
recognize people but you’re not
just a brain are you

(a beat)
Try to listen to the feeling you
get from someone-- Strong
emotions like hate fear or
love They hardly ever lie

Anna is about to go over to the stranger when a familiar
sound causes her to freeze in terror a cell playing
‘Womanizer’

Anna hyper-alert looks around frantically No one pays
attention to the phone ring Finally a woman takes a cell
out of her bag and answers it Anna sags with relief

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Of course none of this is
foolproof You will make
mistakes --

Anna plucks up her courage walks over to the stranger and
determinedly claps her hands over his eyes
The man spins round The uncertainty lingers Then

BRYCE 8
(surprised)
Anna

ANNA
with a smirk)
Remind me to buy you a funkier
tie

BRYCE 8
in disbelief)
You found me out of all these--
How did you do that

ANNA
pulls out her diary
excitedly)
I’ve been seeing this amazing
doctor and--

BRYCE 8
(elated)
-- You recognize me
(with a hysterical cry
of glee)
Does that mean I can cancel the
straitjacket now

As he plants a sloppy kiss on her cheek we see in Anna’s
eyes the damage his words have caused

BRYCE 8
Thank God I couldn’t take
another wacko freak-out every
time I tried to kiss you
(prodding his face
manically)
So this doesn’t change anymore
right You really recognize me

TIGHT on Anna frozen by the dilemma Lie or disappoint
him There is no choice She discreetly slips her diary
back in her bag

ANNA
Yes I do I do recognize you
(forcing a deceitful
radiant smile)
Kiss me

INT PINSNNEEDLES BAR - NIGHT

From the far end of the bar we see Anna explaining
something to Francine 4 and Nina 4

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Of course in relation to your
illness some people will react
better than others

Annas POV Francine 4 is staring at us looking terribly
offended

FRANCINE 4
What You mean you dont
recognize me Your best friend

NINA 4
(elbows Francine 4)
What about Bryce Hows he taking
this

ANNA

He thinks I’m adjusting

He thinks I recognize him now--
(averting their eyes)

He doesnt know I still see him

with a different face each time
(intensely)

And I want you to promise me you

wont tell him

FRANCINE 4
Youre lying to him

ANNA
(anxious)
I dont want to lose him
Hes all I have left damn it

INT LOBBY - START-UP - EVENING

Anna is sitting on the edge of a stool her eyes darting
through the party-goers desperately trying to keep track
of Bryce 8 as he chats to some colleagues

- But as people wipe frame we briefly lose sight of
Bryce 8 and the next beat he has the same face as his
group of colleagues(CGI EFFECT)

Anna gives a weary sigh just as A STRANGER sits down on the
stool next to hers then shoots her an uncomfortably
penetrating gaze

STRANGER
Hiya --
ANNA
(trying to decipher him)
Hey How’s it going
STRANGER

(eyeing her intently)
Didn’t expect to see you here

tonight --
ANNA
(with a set smile)
Yes -- Er It’s good to see
you Um What was your name

again

The man’s eyes narrow He looks around checking the coast
is clear then leans in to whisper in a conspiratorial
voice

STRANGER
That’s odd I usually leave a
strong impression on women

Anna panic rising looks him up and down She grabs her
handbag about to make a hasty exit

ANNA
Excuse me I must really get g--

- but the stranger flicks his leg out blocking her path

STRANGER
What’s the rush This is just
getting interesting
(his eyes gleaming)
Come on make an effort You
know who I am --

Anna stares into his eyes with mounting dread She’s about
to scream

-»- when another man grabs her arm and yanks her toward
him He has a bordeaux striped tie with a pattern

BRYCE 9
(to the stranger)
Hey Mike

The stranger recoils suddenly sheepish

MIKE THE STRANGER
Bryce hey

BRYCE 9

(pulling Anna away)

Sorry I need to borrow her for a
second

(aside to Anna amused)
Thought I’d better rescue you
That was slimy Mike from HR you
were talking to

ANNA
That creep who came onto me at
the Christmas party right before
tossing his cookies on my bag
(relieved)
Is that who it was

Anna looks back at the now pathetic stranger just as Bryce
9 whisks her into the crowd

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

Annas cocktail dress and Bryces suit lie crumpled at the
foot of the bed

Bryce 9 and Anna make love in the half-light While Bryce
9 writhes on top of her Anna closes her eyes for a
fleeting moment then opens them again

From her POV a different uglier man is making love to
her (BRYCE 10) Anna looks away and bears it stoically

NINA (VO)
Hold it right there

INT PINSNNEEDLES BAR - NIGHT

The implications of what Anna has just told Nina 4 are
starting to sink in

NINA 4
You mean you get to bang a new
guy every night without ever
cheating on your boyfriend
(cracking up)
That’d be a dream come true

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

We return to BRYCE 10 and Anna making love Thinking of
Ninas words Anna closes her eyes again longer this
time Then she opens them

Annas POV a distinct improvement BRYCE 11 looks like a
movie star Johnny Depp maybe very sexy

TIGHTER on Anna genuinely aroused by this

EXT DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING

A bustling busy street Anna standing to one side looks
apprehensively at the crowd Anyone of the random blurry
faces could be the killer

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
And most importantly you must
stop being afraid because fear
won’t make the danger go away

Anna turns back to the surveillance car parked across the
street Concerned the two cops -CRAVEN 5 and CARPENTER 5-
fling open their doors but Anna stops them with a shake of
her head and signs ‘give me 5 minutes’ with her hand

She then takes one step forward then another and
overcoming her fear ends up moving deeper into the crowd

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Mingle with others Immerse
yourself in their gestures their
Mannerisms Watch them until
their bodies become a melody for
you

From Annas POV we begin to focus on trivial details
folds in fabric unconscious spasms the abstract
crisscrossing of bodies

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Hum it until you can sing it at
the top of your voice Use all
your resilience Anna but whatever
happens dont let the music stop

and the shapeless mass of passers-by turns into a
magnificently choreographed ballet before our eyes

With a serene expression that we havent seen on her face
for a long time Anna blends in with the crowd of
strangers

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
But above all dont forget your
weekly appointment because you’re
an intriguing case study and in
all honesty I just really like
you

The smile on Annas face becomes more serene She is
passing a newsstand when a HURRYING PEDESTRIAN crashes into
her almost knocking her over He turns to her briefly

HURRYING PEDESTRIAN
Sorry

-before hurrying off again and vanishing into the crowd
Anna is about to set off too when her gaze is drawn to a
newsstand

INSERT on a newspaper headline ‘TEARJERK JACK SLASHES
SEVENTH — New Victim Puts Pressure On Police’ The article
is accompanied by the photo of a smiling girl barely
twenty years old

This hits Anna like a punch to the gut She stands rooted
to the spot for a second then determined buys a copy of
the newspaper and heads off

INT POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Anna waits in front of Lydia 2s desk We recognize the
latter by her permed hair and babydoll voice

LYDIA 2

(shouting above the

noise of the building

work)
Detective Kerrest

(to Anna

conspiratorially)
Please tell him that the whole
goatee thing -- It just doesn’t
work on him He might listen to
you

Kerrest peers around the door His face brightens for an
instant then resumes its formal mask of weariness

KERREST
(to Anna sarcastically)
Seen any more killers on public
transport

Anna gapes at him in amazement for the first time since
the accident this characters face doesnt change (Kerrest
is still played by the same actor)

KERREST
(blinking)
What What did I say

INT DETECTIVE KERRESTS OFFICE - DAY

Anna drags Kerrest into the office by his arm
Through the glass door of the office we see Lydia crane
her neck to listen in

KERREST
(off-guard)
What are you doing

Anna pushes him onto a chair She wants to get things
straight in her mind

ANNA
Sorry but could you just stay
still for a second Id just

like to check something
KERREST
(bemused)
What

Anna stands directly in front of him and closes her eyes
Two seconds go by Anna opens her eyes again feverish with
anticipation

Annas POV Kerrest still has the same face

ANNA
Its you
(squealing with
laughter)
Its still you

A tear rolls down her cheek She immediately brushes it
away

KERREST
(taken aback)
Hey you okay

ANNA
Yes It’s the first time I
recognize someone since the
incident

KERREST
Who Me You recognize me

Anna nods a yeah Kerrest shifts uncomfortably

KERREST
Do you think that means
anything
(a brief cough)
Well I mean me rather than
some other guy

ANNA
I don’t know
(remembering)
My therapist said it might happen-
- Something to do with strong
emotions like hate or fear or --

An awkward silence falls between them For the first time
Anna glimpses the man instead of the badge

ANNA
(defusing the moment)
I mean-- That’s just what my
shrink said

The door opens and in walks a stranger wiping his hands
blood spattered all over his white shirt Trailing behind
him is a solemn-faced little boy sipping a can of soda
We realize it must be LANYON 2 and Nicholas

LANYON 2
Any word from the DA
(noticing Anna he
stops surprised)
Oh Am I interrupting
something

Kerrest straightens up

KERREST
Miss Marchant allow me to
introduce Eric Lanyon our star
pitcher ace profiler and all-
round swell guy

Anna stares quizzically at Lanyon 2’s shirt

LANYON 2
(half-smiling)
They say it takes a warped mind
to get into a psychopath’s
head

He wipes the blood from his fingers and extends his hand

LANYON
But I’m okay
(indicating Nicholas)
Nicky had another nosebleed

TIGHT on Nicky dabbing his nose with a bloodied kleenex
his solemn eyes set on Anna Reassured Anna shakes
Lanyon’s hand her gaze still transfixed on the strange
little boy

ANNA
Good to meet you

LANYON 2
Youre just the way I imagined
you What brings you here

ANNA
(holding up the
newspaper )
I saw the papers I want to know
what there is to know about this
man

KERREST
You have the number one guy right
in front of you Lanyon has quite
a theory about our friendly
neighborhood whackjob

Lanyon 2 bends down to Nicolas

LANYON 2
I betcha cant pinch a pen from
Lydia’s desk

The little boy listlessly exits
Lanyon 2 closes the door after him and turns to Anna

LANYON 2
I dont know if he really tried
to kill you

ANNA
(showing him the scar on
the palm of her hand)
No He has an odd way of asking
for a movie and a meal then

Lanyon is about to retort but Kerrest butts in

KERREST
What hes saying is that maybe
the asshole simply reacted in
self-defence

LANYON 2
Forgive me Miss Marchant but if
he really wanted to kill you once
you left hospital we wouldnt be
standing here talking about it

Anna looks at him confused by his calm intelligence She
glances at Kerrest who nods wearily A long silence then

ANNA
I want to help catch this guy

Kerrest reaches for the mug-shot file but Anna stops him

ANNA
No If I recognize him it wont
be because of his face
I have to see them in the flesh

Kerrest and Lanyon 2 look doubtfully at each other

LANYON 2
Guess it’s worth a shot
(checks his watch)
Id better run if I’m gonna catch
the DA
(on his way to the door)
Good to meet you Miss Marchant

Lanyon 2 leaves the office Anna turns to Kerrest

ANNA
Whats your colleagues theory

KERREST
Lanyon thinks you made one hell
of an impression on the freak
‘cause you saw him do his thing
and walked away

ANNA
What makes you think he’s right

Kerrest sits on the edge of the desk

KERREST

A year ago when Homicide turned
up the first victim Lanyon
insisted the murder had all the
hallmarks of a sociopath’s
handiwork

(recalling bitterly)
We didn’t listen Figured it was
a crime of passion A one-off --

Glancing at the door to make sure Lanyon isnt there
Kerrest leans over to Anna

KERREST

6 months later another dead woman
turned up She had an eight-year-
old son He woke up to find his
mother lying with her throat cut

(gulping)
Lanyon took it so hard he
practically adopted the kid

Kerrest sits wearily back at his desk
KERREST
Since then Ive learnt to keep
my mouth shut and trust Lanyon

Anna digesting all this turns toward the glass door

Through it she sees Nicholas 2 sitting on a couch His
eyes meet Annas and signals to her to remain silent before
sipping from his can of soda again

INT CORRIDOR and CUSTODY ROOM - DAY

LANYON (the original actor) escorts 10 SUSPECTS through the
door A mirror forms the back wall of the room

LANYON
Come on You can drop the
frickin’ Snow White act You’ve
all been here before

A suspect with a dazed expression stops in front of Lanyon
and holds up a cigarillo

DAZED SUSPECT
Got a light Officer

Lanyon snatches the cigarillo and jabs a thumb at a NO
SMOKING sign on the wall

INT BEHIND THE TWO-WAY MIRROR CUSTODY ROOM - DAY

In a dark narrow room Anna watches the scene through the
two-way mirror

Annas POV LANYON 3 (a new actor) twirling the cigarillo
in his hand escorts the suspects into the custody room

LANYON 3
Stand in a line and look straight
ahead Come on step it up

The ten men shuffle into place Lanyon leaves the room
closing the door behind him

On the other side of the mirror the door behind Anna opens
to reveal Kerrest out of breath like he’s rushed to get
here (He has the same face as before) He joins Anna at
the mirror

KERREST
OK you ready

Anna nods nervously her eyes riveted to the suspects

KERREST
Theyre all known offenders
We’re waiting for authorization
to run DNA tests on ‘em
(looking at her
intently)
Theyre all yours

Annas POV her gaze glides from one suspect to the next
Some of the faces are grizzled some bland all of them
ultimately unreadable

Annas gaze runs back along the line from the last to the
first their faces have all changed (ten new actors)

Behind Anna and Kerrest the door opens and LANYON 4 joins
them at the mirror He lights the cigarillo he swiped

LANYON 4
How we doing here

Anna murmurs something in Kerrest’s ear He bends down to
an intercom

KERREST
(to the ten suspects)
Ok turn around I don’t care
about your ugly mugs Now walk
up and down Come on move your
asses Anyone who slacks off gets
a night in the cells

On the other side of the mirror the men obey thinking
its a joke Kerrest perplexed looks at Anna

ANNA
I need to see their gestures and
movements It sounds stupid
but

KERREST
Hey you want to start up a dance
class you got it

Anna pays no attention staring intently at the suspects

Annas POV as when she was walking in the crowd we slowly
focus on specific details the crease in one suspects
jeans the pock-marks on another’s face the hunched
shoulders of a third man

The shots then mingle with FLASHBACK INSERTS of the killer
on the bridge his back to the camera as he kisses the
woman he is about to murder

CLOSE-UP on Anna tense with concentration She ends up
turning to Kerrest and Lanyon 4

ANNA
(sure of herself)
Hes not any of them

Kerrest can’t conceal his disappointment

KERREST
You sure

Anna just as disappointed nods silently

KERREST
Well It was worth a shot

There is nothing else to be said Anna turns to leave
Kerrest racks his brains trying to think of something
anything to detain her

KERREST
Anna

He’s never used her first name before She turns to him A
long drawn-out silence then

ANNA
Good luck with your
investigation

She holds out a hesitant hand then walks out closing the
door behind her

INT CORRIDORS - POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATER- DAY

A grim-faced Kerrest is walking along a corridor when
Lanyon (the original actor since Anna is no longer present)
catches up with him

LANYON

Sam

(walking alongside him)
Bad news Mulgrew cancelled the
protection After the subway blow-
out and the line-up on top of
it They just don’t think she’s
a hundred per cent compis mentis

KERREST

red-alert Defcon 3)
This is bullshit She’s our only
witness for God’s sake

(stubbornly)
We’ve gotta step our game up --
Get another line-up together
Manana

LANYON

(realistic)
Come on We cant bring in every
punk in the city hoping shell
recognize the inside leg of his
trousers

(matter-of-factly)
Though I guess that would give
you an excuse to see her again

LANYON
Though I guess that would give
you an excuse to see her again

Kerrest stops dead in his tracks caught off-guard
He pulls Lanyon aside glancing around to make sure no
one’s within earshot

KERREST

(at machine-gun speed)
One she’s got a boyfriend
Two there’s nothing between us
Three even if there was and
I’ll kick your ass if you ever
mention this to anyone it would
be completely unethical and
possibly illegal for a cop to
fraternize with a key witness
Four-—

LANYON
Whoa It’s that bad

Kerrest sags against the wall with a weary sigh dropping
the gruff fagade for a beat

KERREST
Ah screw it
(ruefully realistic)
Can you picture us arm in arm
at the police ball

LANYON
(supportive)
Why not I always thought you
looked rather fetching in
uniform

A beat Kerrest shakes his head and chuckles

INT PINSNNEEDLES CLUB - NIGHT

TIGHT ON A GLEAMING SILVER BLADE cutting into something
soft and pink We PULL BACK to REVEAL it’s

a birthday cake

Anna looking radiant is sitting at a table with Bryce
12 who kisses her tenderly on the cheek and Francine 5
wearing a dress with a flashy red bow on the shoulder
Opposite her Nina 5 is cutting the cake She hands Anna a
slice

NINA 5
Happy birthday Chica
(whispering to Anna
referring to Bryce)
So what’s on the menu tonight
Quasimodo or Johnny Depp

ANNA
(with a faint smile)
Hmm Tonight I’1l be sampling
Johnny Depp

Francine 5 is fidgeting on her chair pointing to
something off screen

FRANCINE 5
Quick Look A 12 out of 10
(giving a start)
Did you see that He checked me
out Me

Everyone turns to take a peek at the elusive man OS while
Francine 5 pulls out her compact and checks her make-up

INSERT in the mirror we see Francine as she sees herself
in other words with her original face

BRYCE 12
(caustically)
So thats what you do on your
girls nights out

At this point some pounding electronica kicks in From this
point every one has to shout to be heard - Its difficult
to distinguish one voice from another

Nina 5 leaps to her feet already carried off by the beat

NINA 5
Come on Everyones dancing
tonight Even you Bryce

She drags them all over to the packed dance-floor

Annas POV we make our way through a crowd of unfamiliar
faces some friendly others that stare at us strangely

REVERSE ANGLE on Anna a little intimidated She grips
Bryces hand tightly so as not to lose him in the crowd

Nina 5 threads her way through to the middle of the dance-
floor and starts to dance provocatively

Anna inhibited at first ends up throwing herself into it
a great release for all the tension Acting the femme
fatale she slinkily draws Bryce 12 to her by his tie and
dances enticingly against him

Nina nudges Francine with her butt Francine is dancing
halfheartedly eyes clamped on Mr 12-out-of-10 off screen

FRANCINE 5
Oh my God Did you see that He
checked me out AGAIN

NINA 5
Which one

FRANCINE 5
(stepping in front of
her)
Hey back off I saw him first

Anna and Nina burst out laughing Bryce 12 stops dancing
not really in his element on the dance-floor

BRYCE 12
(leaning over to Anna)
Im gonna get a drink White
wine

Anna nods a ‘yeah’ Bryce 12 makes his way to the bar He
vanishes behind someone for a second

---and reappears with his original face (since we are no
longer seeing him from Annas POV) He waves a twenty
trying to attract the barmans attention

Back on the dance-floor Anna and Nina 5 are dancing
sultrily beneath a red spotlight

An ecstatic FRANCINE 6 enters the frame out of breath (we
recognize her showy red bow)

FRANCINE 6
Thats it
(faster and faster)
I spoke to him he wants to buy
me a drink what do I say what
do I do

ANNA
Just go for itand act natural

Francine looks at her strangely A radiant smile spreads
over her usually stressed features

FRANCINE 6
OKAY

Downing her glass in one Francine 6 heads off again
jerking without any rhythm a ridiculous but endearing
figure

Meanwhile living up to her reputation Nina 5 is dancing
over to a GOOD-LOOKING GUY with three-day stubble

Anna sees him smile as he takes Nina 5 in his arms and
dances close against her He makes a strange gesture
sensually caressing her hair and wrapping his hand around
it

FLASHBACK On the bridge the killer made a similar
gesture caressing his victims hair

Anna stands petrified in the middle of the dance-floor
Nina gives her a little wave Anna returns her smile her
unease fading slightly

Anna still unsettled looks around for Bryce He still
hasnt come back with their drinks She pushes her way over
to the bar looks around in vain

Anna then takes out her diary and leafs through it As she
does so she doesnt see the outline of a man watching her
in the bg (he remains a hazy figure because we are
focused on Anna)

INSERT Drawn in the diary is today’s tie violet with
stripes

Anna looks along the bar and focuses on a man leaning on it
with two glasses in his hands His face is unfamiliar -
thats perfectly normal Annas gaze moves down to his tie
violet with stripes

Anna walks over to him and lays her hand on his shoulder
The new Bryce turns round and looks at her

ANNA
Youve been forever
(referring to the
drinks)
Which one’s mine

Bryce 13 hesitates for a second as if he’d forgotten what
was in them He gives her the one in his right hand Anna
thanks him with a quick kiss and takes a sip

ANNA
(with a grimace)
You know I don’t like champagne

A frenzied new tune kicks in Bryce 13 smiles at her
charm on full blast and sweeps her onto the dance-floor
He pulls her close to him moving his hands down to her
rear

ANNA
Hey what did they put in your
drink
BRYCE 13 leans in and kisses her on the mouth Anna
returns the kiss But then over his shoulder sees a
stranger standing at the bar glaring furiously at her

Annas gaze descends to his hands he holds two glasses and
has a violet tie with stripes

Anna’s expression falters as she realizes her mistake

The real Bryce - Bryce 14 - stares daggers at her He sets
the glasses down and stomps off

Anna turns to her partner

FALSE BRYCE (BRYCE 13)
Oops

Anna slaps his face hard before setting off across the
dance-floor after ‘her’ Bryce

ANNA
Bryce wait

Bryce 14 stops and turns to her flushed with rage

BRYCE 14
Let me see your notebook Let me
see it

Anna caught red-handed hands the diary over Bryce whips
through it past the sketches of his various ties his face
turning more and more crimson

BRYCE 14
You lied to me-- I’m just as much
a stranger as everyone else

ANNA
(distraught)
Bryce I
BRYCE 14

Was it me you were seeing when we
made love

(crying out hurt)
Answer me Was it me you were
seeing

Anna looks at him without answering Bryce 14 looks at her
in disgust

BRYCE 14
It’s over Anna This-- face-blind
shit I can’t deal with it
anymore --
(with inarguable
finality)

Find yourself another jerk to
wear a tie

At this he turns and walks off into the crowd yanking his
tie open angrily

We study Annas distraught face as she stands there
stunned beyond all reality Time seems to stand still

The vibration of her cell phone snaps her out of her daze
She hurriedly answers

ANNA
Bryce listen--

MAN (VO)
(singing unnervingly)
Happy birthday dear Anna

The voice is creepy disguised

(unsettled)
Who is this

Anna frowning glances at the phone A shudder of horror
runs through her body

A man jostles Anna She leaps back in terror

KILLER (VO)
No that wasnt me But maybe Im
that guy there to your right
(Anna spins to the left)
No your right Anna Listen to

cell

Annas face collapses She rushes across the dance-floor
pushing people out of the way like a madwoman

ANNA
NINA FRANCINE

Annas POV we see a GIRL with the same hairstyle as
Francine from behind kissing someone Anna grabs her arm
and roughly yanks her back

GIRL
Whats your problem

Anna increasingly panicked pushes further into the crowd
Hundreds of inquisitive faces look at her spinning
dizzyingly around her Someone grips her shoulder Anna
wheels round with a scream

NINA 6

Anna whats happening
ANNA

Nina -- wheres Francine
NINA 6

(looking around

clueless)
She was dancing with Mr 12 out of
10 a moment ago

ANNA
Nina hes here He just called
me from my cell
Nina 6 stares at her wide-eyed

NINA 6
Im calling the cops

But Anna stops her crushing her hand her eyes glued in
horror at something straight ahead

Annas POV between the dancers we intermittently glimpse
a couple embracing in the shadows of one of the alcoves
From behind we see the mans back thrusting against the
woman He shudders then drops the limp body of Francine
7 (whom we recognize from her red bow)

Anna screams Nina 6 too
The killer vanishes into the crowd

Acting on instinct Nina 6 hits the fire alarm A
DEAFENING SIREN wails through the club and in less than a
second a wave of panic sweeps the crowd All the clubbers
rush for the emergency exits

Anna jostled from all sides sees ahead of her

an UNFAMILIAR MAN with a sinister face slipping through
the panicking crowd toward her

Beneath the STROBE LIGHTS his face changes with each
flash in an almost supernatural manner He is crying and
his tears trickle down a multitude of different faces that
follow one after another The rest of his body is in
shadow

Anna remains rooted to the spot hypnotized He is right
before her his bloody razor glinting under the strobe
light--

-- when NINA 7 grabs her hand and drags her into the human
tide rushing for the exit

ANNA
(crying out)
Did you see him

NINA 7
Who
EXT PINSNNEEDLES CLUB - NIGHT

The crowd is still pouring out when two police cars screech
to a halt Uniformed officers leap out guns drawn

Anna carried along in the crowd with Nina 7 whirls
around in terror expecting to see the killer appear any
second Someone crashes into her and she loses Ninas hand

ANNA
Nina Nina

We spin around Anna in a concentric circle lost in this
sea of strangers When suddenly

MAN (0S)
Anna

The familiar face of Kerrest - in plain clothes - appears
in the crowd before her

Anna rushes towards the only person she recognizes and
throws her arms around him clinging to him like a
lifeline He clumsily holds her up

INT PINSNNEEDLES CLUB - NIGHT

Upturned stools broken glassesthe calm after the

Kerrest kneels beside Francines corpse (the original
actress) Her eyes are staring upwards a look of shock
frozen on her face almost as if surprised to be dead

Kerrest grabs his walkie-talkie

KERREST
(barking with
frustration)
Set up a perimeter and comb the
whole area -- Suitcase every damn

pill-popping jerk-off you see
I’1l deal with the paperwork

Behind him the restroom door opens with a faint creak
Kerrest signals to two of his men who move stealthily over
to the restroom

An outline appears fleetingly against the light in the
doorway One of the policemen kicks the door open while the
other aims point blank at

face)
Okay you got me I confess

(holding out the inside

of his wrist to them)
Come on you’re one scratch away
from a perfect DNA match

The cops trading sloppy grins holster their guns
Kerrest is in no mood to laugh

and is floating in the crapper

With a showman’s elan Lanyon pulls from behind his back a
soaked and bloodstained tie in a plastic evidence bag

INT PINSNNEEDLES CLUB - NIGHT

As the crime scene teams flashguns go off in the
background two PARAMEDICS amble past with a black bodybag

In a far corner Kerrest takes a statement from Nina 8
who is slumped on a chair a blanket round her shoulders
sobbing against Anna

NINA 8

(staring at the bodybag)
She wanted to get married to
anyone She didn’t want to grow
old alone She wanted kids --
-- the whole fucking family
portrait

(through her tears)
Why didnt he pick me

KERREST
(gently)
Miss Ezquerra I need to know
exactly what happened The man
dancing with her did you see

him

NINA 8
(vague)

Yes no only from behind
KERREST

Can you describe him to me
NINA 8

No no Basta Estoy harta

Nina leaps to her feet her nerves frazzled

KERREST
(sighs )
Ill have someone drive you home

Nina turns to Anna and hugs her with all her might

ANNA
Oh Nina

NINA 8
(stifling a sob)

Lets talk tomorrow okay
(searching in her
pocket)

Here Para traerte suerte

INSERT Nina 8 slips a can of mace into Annas bag

NINA
Take care of yourself chica

She goes out sobbing just as LYDIA 3 opens the door

LYDIA 3
(to Kerrest)
I heard what happened so I came
to see if you needed me

KERREST
(surprised and touched)
Lydia you’re a star Check in on
Lanyon see he’s got everything
he needs

Lydia 3 looks compassionately at Anna and turns to go

LYDIA 3
(to Kerrest)
Its lucky you werent far away
Detective

Anna looks up at Kerrest in surprise

KERREST
Uh yeah Im a regular ata
bar a couple blocks from here

Anna continues to stare at Kerrest

KERREST
(getting out of his
depth)
And since I was-- you know
having a brew I though it’d be
a good idea to be nearby just
in case

Silence falls between them Doubts fill the air

ANNA
(coldly)
Have you managed to reach Bryce
KERREST
No he’s still not answering his

cell

(thinking it over)
When exactly did he pull his
vanishing act

ANNA
Just before that son of a bitch
called me

KERREST
(inscrutable)
Really
(rereading the
statement )
You said you argued What about

ANNA
He found out

KERREST
Found out what

With a weary sigh Anna holds her diary out to him

ANNA
(bitterly)
That I’d been faking it all
along

Kerrest surprised leafs through the diary His hand stops
at the tie of the day whose color matches that of the one
found by Lanyon in the toilet

KERREST
(bolting up)
Im gonna take you home Just
give me a minute

Kerrest goes over to his men showing them Anna’s diary

INT ANNAS APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is dark The door opens to reveal Anna and
Kerrest He remains in the doorway on the alert

(calling out)

Silence Anna crosses the hallway to the door of the
bedroom and turns the light on

Kerrest discreetly opens his jacket to make his gun easier
to reach

INT BEDROOM - NIGHT

The wardrobe door is open Half of the contents have been
taken in a hurry Items of clothing lie strewn across the
floor

Anna stands motionless staring at the mess Bryce has
left She turns and sees Kerrest watching her from the
doorway

Kerrest awkward takes a step back Anna looks at the
floor embarrassed

ANNA
Youre treading on Bryces
jacket

Anna reaches down to pick the jacket up Kerrest likewise
They freeze each with a hand on it and something falls
from a pocket its Annas cell the one she lost on the
bridge

Anna and Kerrest look at each other in disbelief

KERREST
Is this the jacket he was wearing
this evening

Anna nods unable to utter a word Kerrest pulls out a
handkerchief and gently picks up the phone He checks the
last calls Anna looks at him then at the phone stunned

ANNA
It cant be Bryce -- I know him
(thinking it through)
-- Besides he called me that
night on the bridge

Kerrest listening distractedly dials a number on his own
cell

KERREST
Well that’s a trick we’1ll have
to ask him about
(into his phone)
Lanyon Kerrest No he isnt
here but guess what Ive just
found --

The scene is now INTERCUT WITH

INT LANYONS OFFICE - POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Lanyon his body tired but his eyes still lively finishes
his twentieth coffee of the night as he listens to Kerrest

LANYON
(ironic)
Not a bad haul for one night

KERREST
What d’you mean

LANYON
He strings us along for one year
and then we get all this evidence
in one go Dont you think thats
a bit too easy

Kerrest paces up and down in Annas bedroom

KERREST
Ill chew on that once we have a
DNA sample of this Bryce guy
Ive put out a warrant for his
arrest

On hearing the word warrant Anna glances aghast at the
Detective

LANYON
So where’s Anna right now

KERREST
Here with me
(glancing at Anna)
And until we get him I ain’t
letting her out of my sight
I want her totally insulated

LANYON
I’ll talk to the DA
(flipping through
papers)
But I won’t know anything before
Monday You know the drill

KERREST
(frustrated)
Monday Fuck I dont believe
it
(mind racing)
Ill bring her back Monday

He hangs up and turns determinedly to Anna

KERREST
Do you trust me

Anna looks at him oddly for a second her eyes searching
his Finally she gives a tentative nod

KERREST
Then pack a few things Were
leaving town

FADE IN
EXT COASTAL ROAD - MORNING

A car heads along the coast highway on a blazingly sunny
morning in stark contrast with the urban setting we’ve
been confined to

INT KERRESTS CAR - MORNING
Kerrest is at the wheel In the rearview mirror he studies
Anna asleep on the back seat breathing softly

EXT FERRY DECK - MORNING

A ferry heads out into the ocean as the coastline shrinks
on the horizon

On deck Anna shivers as she looks at the dark rolling
waves buffeted by the strong sea wind Kerrest is watching
her from the deck above leaning over the railing

Anna sets off up the narrow stairs on the side of the ship
The sea is choppy and she has trouble getting up the
stairs She has almost reached Kerrest

---when a wave suddenly lifts the ship Anna loses her
balance and almost topples over the side Kerrest grabs her
around the waist just in time

KERREST
Careful

Anna and Kerrests eyes meet for a second And from Annas
Pov for a flash it’s not Kerrest but the killer looking
down at her just as he did from the bridge (FLASHBACK)

Anna looks at him shivering and bemused

ANNA
(stammering)
I slipped

KERREST
(removing his sweater)
Youre cold Put this on

ANNA
What about you

KERREST
(sniffing the sea air
and acting tough)
Its okay They breed them tough
on the island

Anna smiles weakly and puts the sweater on

KERREST
(examining the horizon)
There she is

Brushing back her wind-lashed hair Anna sees a tiny island
slowly emerge from the spray Its lighthouse and olde-world
white houses are barely visible above the horizon and the
waves seem to be about to engulf them any minute

KERREST
Youll see its another world

INT VILLAGE STREET - ISLAND - DAY

Anna follows Kerrest through the narrow lanes of the
village The worn colonial facades lend a sad and timeless
beauty to the place

An OLD WOMAN with a shopping basket and then a POSTMAN on
his bicycle greet Kerrest

ANNA
(surprised)
Everyone knows you

KERREST

Everyone knows everyone here

theres only one doctor for the

whole island
(pointing to a yellow
mailbox)

One mailbox one cash-point
(pointing to a sailor
passing on a bicycle)

No-one drives apart from the

firefighters

Anna drinks it all in wide-eyed

KERREST
I told you It really is another
world
(pointing to a building
ahead)
And that’s the only school

Anna turns to a deserted schoolyard where half a dozen
children are playing

ANNA
Where are the other children

KERREST
Looks like theyre all here

ANNA
Wow That’s a small class

KERREST
That’s the whole school There’s
only one teacher on the island
All the years are taught
together

A TEACHER comes out into the yard clapping her hands to
announce the end of break She looks like an older version
of Anna Meeting their gaze she gives them a warm smile
before going back in with the children

A tiny smile the first in hours lights up Anna’s face

EXT BACKYARD - KERRESTS HOUSE - EVENING

A tall narrow house in need of a little care

In the backyard that overlooks the beach the remnants of a
grilled fish supper lie on the table The embers still
glow

Kerrest standing watches Anna on the beach below as he
makes a phone call We cannot hear what he says

EXT BEACH — ISLAND - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP on Anna wrapped in a sweater that is too big for
her looking out to sea Kerrest comes up behind her

KERREST
Theyve arrested him He denies
everything He says someone must
have slipped the phone into his
pocket

Anna looks down shaking her head

ANNA
Im never going to believe it was
him

KERREST
Well soon know They’re
checking his DNA against the tear
sample

(concerned by her lack
of reaction)
How are you holding up

In reply Anna takes a few steps towards the waves hugging
herself to keep warm gazing into the open sea

ANNA
I don’t know It’s not just other
people’s faces that have
changed

Over this she steps into the water and gazes down at her
constantly shifting reflection

ANNA
(considering the
distance travelled)
It’s like I had to wait ‘til I
couldn’t recognize myself to know
who I really am

Kerrest looks at her intensely

KERREST
Could you close your eyes For
a second

ANNA
My eyes

Kerrest nods Anna closes her eyes

KERREST
You were like that when I first
saw you at the hospital
(Anna is about to open
her eyes again)
No not yet --

Kerrest reaches out hesitantly to her face but stops a
hair from touching her

KERREST
I got a call when they brought
you in You were out cold I
looked down at you like I look
down at Jane Does every day and--
(trouble forming words)
--it was like I knew you
(snorting at himself)
I know it sounds wacko--

ANNA
-- As wacko as not recognizing
faces huh

Anna opens her eyes and gazes at Kerrest She really looks
at him for a long moment

ANNA
I can do wacko

She steps towards him still hesitant and decides to kiss
him Kerrest throws aside all professional restraint and
hungrily returns her kiss

INT BEDROOM - KERRESTS HOUSE - NIGHT

Series of close ups reminiscent of the opening titles
lips planting gentle kisses on a neck a curl of blonde
hair brushing an eyelid Annas fingers digging into
Kerrests back We are so close we’re unable to
coherently view the bodies that form abstract carnal
shapes

EXT KERRESTS HOUSE - ISLAND - EARLY MORNING

The sun rises over the island

INT BATHROOM and BEDROOM - KERRESTS HOUSE - MORNING

Kerrest shirtless at the washbasin stares oddly at his
own reflection in the mirror then at that of Anna
sleeping in his bedroom behind

The Detectives hand reaches into the bathroom drawer
looking for something a cutthroat razor like the
killers

CLOSE-UP on Anna sleeping fitfully Her features quiver

EXT BRIDGE UNDER RENOVATION - NIGHT (DREAM)

In SLOW MOTION Anna relives the moment when the killer
grabs her by her blouse just before she falls over the
edge

From Annas POV the killer’s face twists like an
Expressionist painting his mouth uttering her name in a
horribly distorted voice

KILLER
AAAAANNNNNNNNAAAAAAA

In succession his face becomes Bryces then Kerrests
then Bryces again then that of a STRANGER
The bridge and the night suddenly vanish behind him and

INT BEDROOM - KERRESTS HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Anna wakes with a scream the stranger isnt a dream He
is straddling her shaking her by the shoulders

STRANGER
Anna Anna

On instinct Anna grabs the bedside lamp and smashes it
over his head The stranger rolls off her with a groan
Anna leaps out of bed and runs out of the room

STRANGER (0S)
Anna its me

Halfway down the stairs Anna glances back at the stranger
who gets to his feet rubbing his head with a dazed look
She notice some traces of shaving foam on his neck

STRANGER
Dont you recognize me anymore

Anna concentrates on his voice and looks at him astounded
This is indeed a new Kerrest - KERREST 2 (played by a new
actor)

ANNA
(floored)
You youve shaved

KERREST 2
I wanted to surprise you --
Lydia and her dumb ideas

Kerrest 2 walks towards her as if nothing had changed
Anna backs away uneasy

ANNA

(recalling Dr

Langenkamps words)
‘Anything that stands out will
make the face easier to
identify’

(with bitter

realization)
I’m such a fool --

Kerrest 2 tries to kiss her but Anna pushes him away

ANNA
Dont you understand Theres
nothing special between us
just a goatee

Kerrest 2 ignores her and presses her against the
staircase wall kissing her forcefully Anna furious
struggles in vain Kerrest 2 keeps on kissing her Annas
rage ebbs away and is replaced by overwhelming emotion
She closes her eyes and returns the kiss

ANNA
(mystified)
Its still you
(opening her eyes)
Even without your face
Its still you

The police siren tone of his cell phone interrupts them
Kerrest 2 rushes over to the bedside table and answers it

KERREST 2
Hey Lanyon Well

over)

Anna doesnt need to hear their conversation to understand
what its about

KERREST 2
Ill call you later

Kerrest 2 hangs up and looks at Anna clearly uneasy

KERREST 2
The DNA was negative Bryce is
not the killer

The implications hang unspoken in the air The pair seem
suddenly distant Anna sits on the top step and buttons
herself up Kerrest 2 deflated flops on the bed and
absently rubs his head He grimaces when his fingers touch
the spot Anna hit him with the lamp

I’1l leave you to it

Anna freezes as she remembers something

Anna agitated is talking to a new Dr Langenkamp (DR

DR LANGENKAMP 3
Hypnosis is like a carnival
mirror It distorts the truth as
much as it reflects it

ANNA
But it could work

Or have disastrous consequences
on your psyche

Ill take that risk

Dr Langenkamp 3 glances at Kerrest 2 before giving in
with a sigh

echo infinitely

TIGHT on Anna’s face lying on a couch her eyes wide open
looking tense

From her POV the concerned faces of Dr Langenkamp 3 and

On the count of three youre
going to close your eyes and
travel back in your memories as

The looming faces of Dr Langenkamp and Kerrest have

reverted to their original incarnations since they’re no

The FOOTAGE starts unfolding in REVERSE at top speed as if
we were REWINDING the whole film

EXT BRIDGE - ANNAS MEMORIES FADED COLOURS - NIGHT

Anna re-experiences her fall in reverse bursting out of
the water and soaring through the air The droplets of

Anna hits the scaffolding Then she performs a reverse flip
onto the bridge landing face to face with the killer

DR LANGENKAMP (VO)
Can you tell me who is there with
you

distorted face

Concentrate on the distinguishing
markers Like with Mike and

Maggy

Now from Anna’s POV the face starts to come into focus
But the lips stretch back into an impossibly wide
hideously cruel grin They keep stretching Back
Back

- Until we see beneath a crudely-drawn face crying
cartoon tears exactly like the face Nicky drew

From Anna’s POV her fingers reach into screen and tear
through the crudely drawn face The more she tries to grab
it the more it rips until finally the pieces fall away
revealing the distorted blur it was before

ANNA
(exhausted)
I’m sorry I can’t-- I

In the consulting room Dr Langenkamp shakes her head
ruefully Kerrest stands there at a loss out of his depth

DR LANGENKAMP
Her impairment is creating a
barrier its impossible to get
through even with hypnosis

KERREST

Damn it she knows She knows
who he is

Dr Langenkamp looks down at Anna’s pain-wracked face

DR LANGENKAMP

I’m going to use suggestion to
try to forge a bypass

seen from behind its impossible to tell if it is really
Bryce or someone else

Lanyon sits on a stool near the bar and watches them
discreetly

Back at the table from Annas POV Bryce 15 takes an
envelope from his pocket and clumsily holds it out to her

Anna takes the envelope and tears a corner of it She
sees

From her POV we see a STRANGER in a white shirt a holster
under his arm running towards her from the left

ANOTHER MAN with the same shirt and holster runs towards
her from the right

time as if each is aiming at a reflection

Both men are shouting and we are unable to tell their
voices apart over the din of the roller-bladers

SWISH PAN to Kerrest (the original actor) also rushing into
the seething mass He barely dodges a roller-blader by
jumping out of his way

SWISH PAN to Lanyon (the original actor) also lost in the
mass dodging the roller-bladers with the agility of a
cat

Anna advances blindly as if in a huge swarm of bees
She thinks she catches a sudden glimpse of

the glinting blade of the killers razor that flashes
intermittently between two roller-bladers

Kerrest gun in hand catches sight of Anna straight
ahead

A ROLLER-BLADER crashes right into him Kerrest is thrown
forward and rolls over the ground His gun skitters into

it up and finally emerges from the swarm finding
herself

EXT PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE UNDER REPAIR - NIGHT

back where it all began The bridge stretches out ahead
of her like a sinister invitation

Gun in hand Anna sets off across it
EXT PEDESTRIAN PATH - BRIDGE UNDER REPAIR - NIGHT

We slip through the scaffolding and wind-lashed plastic
sheeting that divides the pedestrian route from the bridge
proper Despite the bridge’s narrowness this transforms it
into a cramped claustrophobic labyrinth

The silhouette of a man appears behind one of the plastic
sheets

MAN (0S)
(whispering his voice
impossible to identify)
Anna Its me are you there
Anna

Beneath the sheeting Anna is huddled against the edge of
the bridge The shadow vanishes Anna slowly stands and
risks a peep through a hole in the sheeting

--just as the man passes in front of the hole

Anna turns away just in time On the other side we see the
mans face clearly through the hole Its Kerrest Unable
to see Anna he continues on his way

Chest heaving unable to tell which man is there Anna
looks over the edge of the bridge at the dark waters of the
river 20 feet below She has an idea

At another spot on the bridge Lanyon slips between the
scaffolding his gun in one hand and the razor in the
other

LANYON
(as if he were Kerrest)
How did it come to this Eric
Anna Stay right where you are

Lanyon stealthily moves over to a piece of plastic sheeting
that hides a corner of the bridge

LANYON
Nice and safe

With one swift movement Lanyon whisks back the edge of the
sheeting with his razor Anna isnt behind it

Lanyon hears the police sirens approaching in the distance

Lost in the maze of sheeting and scaffolding Kerrest also
hears the sirens

KERREST
(shouting)
Anna Stay hidden Back up will
be here any m--

A bullet careens off the scaffolding just above his ear
Kerrest ducks If only he had his gun

Lanyon his gun smoking looks around animal-like trying
to pinpoint Kerrest in the maze of rustling shadowy
plastic

Meanwhile Anna has taken off her shoes and tucked the gun
under her belt She climbs over the edge of the bridge and
hidden by a length of plastic sheeting moves perilously
along the outside

LANYON (0S)

First theres the fucking kid
(distraught)

who sees me off his mother
(shouting)

You think hed tell someone huh

But oh no Not a word Not a

single peep In a year The

Kerrest listens squatting down sickened

LANYON (0S)

Then theres you Anna who saw
me crying when thats NOT
ALLOWED

(laughing nervously)

It was so magical youve
lost all the other faces because
of it

q

Anna continues to edge gingerly along the bridge

when with a sound of RIPPED PLASTIC the face of a
STRANGER (Lanyon 6) bursts through the sheeting razor in
hand a few inches from her face

Anna terrified screams and lets go She grabs hold of the
scaffolding with one hand her legs thrashing in the air

LANYON 6
Oh no Youre not doing your big
diving act again

Gripping the scaffolding with one hand Anna aims the gun
at his face with the other

ANNA
Eat this you bas--

The trigger clicks Nothing happens

LANYON 6
(annoyed)
Goddamn it Anna the safety
catch This is getting fucking
ridiculous

He pulls his head back from the hole and vanishes
Anna hoists herself over the edge and up onto the

pedestrian walkway of the bridge again Her hands shaking
she examines the gun and finds the safety catch Click

Back to Kerrest a mere 15 feet behind but still lost in
the maze of plastic sheets and scaffolding As he edges
forward he slips on something and grabs a pipe to steady
himself He looks down to see a streak of spilled oil An
idea forms in his mind

A short distance away Anna holding the gun with both
hands wheels round on the spot in terror She takes a step
back and finds herself face to face with a STRANGER in
the middle of the bridge His hands are empty

STRANGER
Shhhh

Anna stares at him long and hard unable to tell who he is
He takes a step towards her BLAM A bullet slams into the
metal by his toe

ANNA
(gun hand shaking)
Stay where you are I mean it

The stranger stops and looks over his shoulder

STRANGER
(whispering)
Its me Anna And if we stay
here we make one hell of a
target
(he steps forward again
holding his hand out to
her)
Please Anna give me back my
gun

Anna backs away clutching the gun tight She desperately
tries to discern who the voice belongs to but the blast of
the wind through the scaffolding makes it impossible

ANNA
Stop

STRANGER
(thinking fast)
Anna On the island theres a
school with a half dozen
pupils

Anna freezes wracked by doubt

STRANGER
Recognize me now

INSERT in his sleeve he holds the unfolded razor

We return to Kerrest with one finger he is frantically
smearing the oil on his chin and upper lip

Meanwhile the fake Kerrest is just a few steps from Anna
She lowers her gun but then changes her mind
ANNA
What did you promise me earlier
just before you left

STRANGERLANYON 7
Very good I could have told
Lanyon about the weekend but
thats something only I can know
right

Pretending to run his hand over his face Lanyon 7 pulls
out the razor without Anna noticing

when another man bursts out from behind the scaffolding
surprising them both Anna with a start trains the gun on
him

And from Annas POV we recognize Kerrest with his
original face again He has daubed a goatee on his face in
oil so Anna will recognize him

KERREST
Anna LOOK OUT

Lanyon 7 pounces on Anna a truly deranged gleam in his
eye The razor slashes down in a bright arc

when Anna fires at point-blank range

fingers are blasted away They fall spinning into the
depths

LANYON 7
(to Anna)
I knew you were the one
whod end all this shit

A shivering wild-eyed LANYON turns from Anna breathless
to Kerrest who is standing behind him a mixture of pity
and revulsion in his eyes In the bg we hear sirens
approaching

KERREST
(gesturing to Lanyon’s
holster)
Just give me the gun Eric Don’t
make this any uglier

Lanyon bursts into excruciating tears of self-hatred pulls
out his gun and holds it out limply toward Kerrest

Relieved Kerrest trudges over and clasps a hand on
Lanyon’s gun

But before he can pull it free Lanyon launches
forward and with a howl of frustration tackles Kerrest

The momentum of this violent move throws them off balance
and the two men crash through a plastic sheet of the
scaffolding Scrabbling furiously to cling onto anything
they topple over the bridge
ANNA
No

Powerless Anna runs frenziedly toward the bridge’s edge

EXT OVER THE BRIDGE SCAFFOLDING RIVER - NIGHT

A half-built section of scaffolding stretching from the
river level to the bridge Struts and columns jut out at
odd angles

Half way down Kerrest and Lanyon are both hanging by one
hand onto a steel pipe fighting over the gun with the
other hand

Right above them Anna leans over the bridge and points her
gun trying to draw a bead on Lanyon but he and Kerrest are
too tightly entangled

Below Lanyon viciously kicks Kerrest in the stomach with
one foot and manages to wrench the gun from his grasp

Kerrest clambers hand over fist to the end of the pipe
Lanyon shoots with his injured hand barely missing him

Kerrest wrapping his legs around the girder frenziedly
unscrews the large circular bolt holding the pipe

Lanyon raises the gun again now aiming it straight at
Kerrest

When the section of the pipe he was hanging from
detaches itself from the rest of the scaffolding

Lanyon drops gracefully an incredulous bewildered look on
his face

impaling himself ten feet below on a loose vertical
pipe jutting from the water It rips through his chest in a
shower of gore Lanyon’s body sags his face frozen in mute
shock

Above Anna helps Kerrest climb back over the bridge’s
railing Utterly exhausted Kerrest stands there smiling
at her Anna smiles back tears of relief welling in her
eyes

INSERT BELOW on Lanyon’s mutilated hand raising his gun
aiming at Anna and Kerrest above BAM

A shot echoes in the night On the bridge both Anna and
Kerrest are jolted with surprise They look at each other
to make sure they’re okay

- when horribly a flower of blood blossoms across
Kerrest’s shirt

ANNA
NO

Hyperventilating Kerrest spins round unsteadily seeing
Lanyon below the gun still smoldering

TIGHT ON LANYON’s face his last tear a tear of blood
trickling from one eye

LANYON
(with his last breath)
Guess youll heh never take

her to the police ball

He slumps finally dead the waves washing the blood oozing
from his body

Above on the bridge Anna rushes over to a staggering
Kerrest Slipping from Anna’s grip he collapses against
the railing Anna kneels over him in great distress

KERREST
(lying)
Ill be okay Ill be okay

ANNA
Dont move Dont say anything

Anna helpless watches the blood blossom darkly over
Kerrests white shirt

ANNA
Dont leave me You have no right
to leave me
(a beat then)
I love you

KERREST
(with a faint smile)
No you dont Im just
(choking but still
smiling)
-Im just a face in the crowd

Anna kisses him in desperation When she pulls back
Kerrest stares at her with shining eyes

KERREST
You’1l -- find someone else
Youll see You--

He’s dead Anna stares at him holding back her tears A
drop of water lands on the Detectives face Then two Then
ten Torrential rain starts falling over the city

Anna watches blandly as the oil from Kerrest’s chin then
his features are slowly washed away by the rain becoming
those of a total STRANGER

With the torrential rain drowning her tears Anna struggles
to her feet and turns her back on him She walks across to
the opposite bank a tiny figure lost in the dark sheets of
rain The sirens draw closer in the distance

FADE TO BLACK
FADE IN
EXT BEACH - MISTY MORNING

The pale shores of the island Anna is alone on the beach
comfortable in Kerrest’s sweater Her hair has grown
There’s a newfound air of wisdom in the way she gazes
knowingly into the rolling waves

ANNA (VO)
I live here now The education
department accepted my transfer
request

INT SCHOOL — ISLAND - DAY

Through the window of a quaint classroom we catch a
glimpse of Anna teaching SEVEN PUPILS four girls aged 8 a
boy aged 4 and two young women aged 13

ANNA (VO)
I recognize each of my pupils
perfectly

EXT STREET - VILLAGE — ISLAND - DAY

A charmingly rustic street on which a farmer’s market has
been set up Anna ambles lazily down it carrying a bag of
groceries As bright sunshine spills into her face she
brushes a loose strand of hair behind her ear

ANNA (VO)
As well as the handful of people
who live here in the off
season

Anna greets the odd passer-by who returns her greeting
There’s something slightly distant about her smile
EXT BEACH - DAY

The ocean ROARS and the waves crash on the beach In the
distance Anna walks with a new incarnation of Nina ANNA (VO)
Nina comes to see me from time to
time She’s still single
Me I’m just taking one step at a
time

INT BUSY MALL - DAY

A crowded shopping mall on a sunny Saturday afternoon

ANNA (VO)
Sometimes I go to the mainland
to a mall where I dont know
anyone and where no one cares if
I don’t recognize them

Tight on Anna pushing a trolley gazing absently at the
crowded aisles

Annas POV strangers as far as the eye can see We hold on
a bearded man

ANNA (VO)
Sometimes I see a face in the
crowd And for a fraction of a

second it’s like I see him again-

Annas POV someone passes in front of the bearded man
When he reappears we think we see Kerrest but the
illusion doesnt last long and the man disappears from
view

ANNA (VO)
That’s the only way I can keep
his face in my memory

Suddenly a bright excitable voice squeals with glee
behind Anna She swishes round to find

ANNA’S DAUGHTER
(delighted)
Mommy Look

- An angelic 4 year old little girl with bright awestruck
eyes She’s holding out a stuffed bird as carefully as if
it were a live one offering it to her mom with a delighted
smile

ANNA (VO)
Except when I look into her eyes

Anna sweeps her daughter off her feet and plants a
lingering peck on her forehead then on the stuffed bird

ANNA (VO)
Just when I thought I’d lost
everything I found a face
One face in which I can always
read love

Hand in hand mother and daughter rush off into the crowd
like playful kids Their gleeful faces vanish into the
crowd of hurrying shoppers

THE END
Prosopagnosia’ or ‘Face blindness’ was coined by German
neurologist Joachim Bodamer in 1947 This impairment
affects 2 of the population The symptoms depicted in this
screenplay are real

Few successful therapies have so far been developed for
those affected although individuals often learn to use
‘feature by feature recognition strategies
