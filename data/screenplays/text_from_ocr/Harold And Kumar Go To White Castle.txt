Harold does not appear happy hes doing this

INT HALLWAY
HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors
walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway

HAROLD
If we get caught youre taking the
blame This wasnt my idea

KUMAR
Were not gonna get caught Were gonna
get toasted and then were gonna eat
delicious White Castle-- just like we
planned
All of a sudden a hand grabs Kumar from behind

out they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled
feely)
MALE NURSE
Dr Patel thank God I found you I need
your help immediately
The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room

INT EMERGENCY ROOM

The scene is very fast paced with several YOUNG
TECHNICIANS rushing around Harold is confused and

concerned
as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a
patient
HAROLD
(whispering to Kumar)
What the hells going on here
KUMAR
He must think Im Saikat Dont worry
Leave the talking up to me
On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS
CHEST
He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003

MALE NURSE
The patient was brought in by EMS five
minutes ago He has three gunshot wounds
with entry in the anterior abdomen No
exit wounds
HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENTS chest

HAROLD
Oh shit This guys gonna die

THE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD

MALE NURSE
Its a good thing I found you two All
the other surgeons are working on other
patients
The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument

HAROLD
Wait Hold on You see you got this all
wrong Were not doc
KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth

KUMAR
What Dr Lee is trying to say is that we
need to sedate the patient first or else
he could go into cardiac arrest

HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous

MALE NURSE
Alright Ill get the anesthesiologist
The NURSE is about to rush away but Kumar stops him

KUMAR
Hold on What we should probably use is
marijuana Thatll sufficiently sedate
the patient for surgery

MALE NURSE
(confused)
Marijuana But why

KUMAR
We dont have time for questions We
need marijuana now Get as much of it as
possible Like a big bag of it
KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands

DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003

MALE NURSE
But doctor we dont have marijuana in
this hospital
HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look

KUMAR
(to himself)
Shit
Suddenly more blood squirts from the Patients chest
Harold shouts in disgust making the Patient more nervous

MALE NURSE
Were losing him You gotta do something

KUMAR
(disappointed)
Very well I guess well have to do this
the old fashioned way
KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patients face
Harold gives Kumar a look-- What the fuck are you doing

KUMAR (CONTD)
First we need to clear his C-spine I

want stat x-rays of the chest and

abdomen Give me two large bore IVs and

start a ringers lactate push Nurse we

need 2 units of O neg on board
Using the surgical equipment Kumar actually begins removing
bullets from the bleeding patient Harold cant believe
whats going on
Suddenly the Patient begins having trouble breathing Hes
gasping for air The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate
begins speeding up to an insane pace

MALE NURSE
Doctor The patient is desatting
Kumar quickly examines the patients chest

KUMAR
Ah I see The Patients got a collapsed
lung Get me a 14-gage Angiocath stat
After a couple seconds go by

KUMAR
Whats taking so long

DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003

The NURSE hands KUMAR what is essentially a LARGE
NEEDLE

Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the
Patients

chest Its a tense moment The Patient is scared So
is

Harold The Nurse looks hopeful Kumar looks
determined

With a quick thrust Kumar jabs the needle into the
Patients

chest causing a rush of air The Patient breathes

easier
His heart rate drops back to normal
MALE NURSE
Great catch doctor His sat is up to 94
Kumar is cool and collected He turns to the YOUNG
MEDICAL

TECHNICIANS who have been aiding the surgery
his

nitrous

stores

KUMAR
(casual)
Will one of you guys put the chest tube
in and wrap this up
A chorus of yes doctors

KUMAR
(taking off his gloves)
Well it looks like my work here is done
Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patients face up to

face and takes a deep breath getting a big hit of

He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT who is just
barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits

looks nervously at FREAK SHOW who doesnt seem to have

heard
a thing Harold seems relieved
FREAK SHOW

back then-- you know because of all the
hideous boils on his face and neck But

he had the most amazing voice -- like a
baby canary
Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- are we

talking about the same Freakshow

LIANE

Well one day after Easter service I

told him how much I enjoyed his solo and

he just mustered up some courage and

asked me out The rest is history And

Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds without
saying a word as they watch the car slowly disappear in the
distance Eventually Harold breaks the silence

HAROLD

KUMAR

HAROLD

throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashiers face

walks with him keeping his distance They reach the street
On the other side he sees AN ORANGE DONT WALK SIGN LIT

KUMAR
So after you talk to the cops were still
going to White Castle right

HAROLD

Harold waits for the DONT WALK sign to change It
doesnt HE STARTS PRESSING THE WALK BUTTON REPEATEDLY

KUMAR
You know pressing the button a bunch of
times doesnt make the sign change any
faster The computer responds to the
first press Every press after that is
extraneous

HAROLD
Thank you Mr Wizard
HAROLD waits for a few seconds but when the light doesnt
change he begins pressing the button again

HAROLD
Jesus Christ When are they gonna
fucking develop button technology thatll
understand urgency
The DONT WALK sign still wont change Kumar looks to the
left and then to the right The street is completely empty
and there is no place for a police car to hide

KUMAR

Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk where we
see HIPPIE ASSHOLES BIG BAG OF WEED along with Harolds
WALLET and LAPTOP He then starts filing a report on
Harold
Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars

HAROLD
Can I at least give you my cars licence

Harold turns around and examines his cell Inside with him
is a black man (TARIK) sitting down reading a book Harold
sits down across from Tarik
While Harold isnt looking we see Officer Palumbo take the
cash out of Harolds wallet and pocket it

HAROLD
So what are you in here for

TARIK
For being black

HAROLD
Come on Seriously
TARIK sits up He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who with his
Walkman on is oblivious to their conversation

DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003

TARIK
I am serious You wanna know what
happened
Harold nods

TARIK
I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble
and a cop stops me Evidently a black
man robbed a store in Newark Therefore
since Im black it was probably me
right
Harold shrugs his shoulders

TARIK
Well that was the logic the cop used I
told him I havent even been to Newark in
months Then he pointed a gun at me and
told me to stop resisting arrest I
said Hey Im not resisting anything
So he starts beating me with his gun
screaming at me telling me to stop
resisting

HAROLD
Holy shit What did you do

TARIK
I kept saying I understand that Im
under arrest Please stop beating me
But that didnt work Then another cop
showed up Then another When it was
all said and done it took nine cops to
bring me in here

HAROLD
That fucking blows
Tarik nods and continues reading his book Harold sees
that
Tarik is remarkably relaxed
HAROLD
I dont understand how youre able to be
so calm about all this

TARIK
Son Im fat Im black I cant dance
And I have two gay fathers Ive had
people messing with me my whole life

I learned a long time ago theres no
point in getting all riled up every time
a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time
Because in the end the universe tends to
unfold as it should

KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
the EARLY MORNING HORIZON The sun is still rising The
scene is very picturesque

KUMAR
Our parents came to this country
escaping persecution poverty and
hunger Hunger Harold They were very
very hungry And they wanted to live in

a land that treated them as equals A
land where their kids could study and get
into good colleges A land filled with
hamburger stands And not just one type
of hamburger Hundreds of types-- with
different sizes toppings and
condiments That land was America

THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER

(turning to Rold)
You think this is just about the burgers
No This is about achieving what our
parents set out for This is about the
pursuit of happiness This is about the
American dream

KUMAR

And so weve reached this point The

point which all men eventually have to

face The point of no return

We can stay here get arrested and end

our hopes of ever going to White Castle
