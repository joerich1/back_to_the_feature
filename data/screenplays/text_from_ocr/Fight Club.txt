holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACKS MOUTH
Tyler is sitting in Jacks lap

They are both sweating and disheveled both around 30 Tyler

ground zero Maybe you should say a
few words to mark the occasion

With a gun barrel between your teeth
you only speak in vowels

Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth

JACK

With my tongue I can feel the
rifling in the barrel For a second
I totally forgot about Tylers whole
controlled demolition thing and I
wondered how clean this gun is

Tyler checks his watch

TYLER

Six months ago Bobs testicles were
removed Then hormone therapy He
developed bitch tits because his
testosterone was too high and his
body upped the estrogen That was
where my head fit -- into his huge

docile We accept our fate

Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures

Jack laughs

TYLER
Emergency water landing 600 miles
per hour Blank faces -- calm as
Hindu cows

JACK

What do you do Tyler

TYLER
What do you want me to do

JACK
I mean -- for a living

TYLER
Why So you can say Oh thats
what you do -- And be a smug little
shit about it

and lifts a BRIEFCASE

You have a kind of sick desperation
in your laugh

Jack points to his own briefcase

JACK
We have the same briefcase

Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack

TYLER
Open it

lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP

TYLER
Soap -- the yardstick of civilization
(reaches in his pocket)
I make and sell soap

Tyler hands Jack his card THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY

TYLER
If you were to add nitric acid to the
soap-making process one would get
nitroglycerin With enough soap one
could blow up the world if one were
so inclined

Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut Jack stares

JACK
Tyler you are by far the most
interesting single-serving friend
Ive ever met

Tyler stares back Jack enjoying his own chance to be
witty leans closer to Tyler

JACK
You see when you travel everything
is small self-contained--

Along a residential street Jack looks ahead sees a tall
grey bland BUILDING on the corner

JACK (VO)
Home was a condo on the fifteenth
floor of a filing cabinet for widows
and young professionals The walls
were solid concrete A foot of
concrete is important when your next-
door neighbor lets her hearing aid go
and has to watch game shows at full
volume

The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the
building A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-
OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor FIRETRUCKS POLICE CARS
and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area

-- Or when a volcanic blast of debris
that used to be your furniture and
personal effects blows out your floor-
to-ceiling windows and sails flaming
into the night

INT PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

Jack in the foreground FACES CAMERA In the BACKGROUND
Tyler sits at a bench looking at individual FRAMES cut from
movies Near him a PROJECTOR rolls film

JACK
Tyler was a night person He
sometimes worked as a projectionist
A movie doesnt come in one big reel
its on a few In old theaters two
projectors are used so someone has
to change projectors at the exact
second when one reel ends and
another reel begins Sometimes you
can see two dots on screen in the
upper right hand corner

Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS
briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN

TYLER
Theyre called cigarette burns

JACK
Its called a changeover The
movie goes on and nobody in the
audience has any idea

TYLER
Why would anyone want this shitty job

JACK
It affords him other interesting
opportunities

TYLER
-- Like splicing single frames from
adult movies into family films

JACK
In reel three right after the
courageous dog and the snooty cag --
who have celebrity voices -- eat out
of a garbage can theres the flash
of Tylers contribution

In the AUDIENCE CHILDREN suddenly start squirming
confused looking at each other

A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw feeling
vaguely terrible Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans
back in his seat

Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window

TYLER

Marla begins a slow exotic dance moving very close to
Jack She lifts her dress dangerously high dancing close
to Jacks body almost touhcing

MARLA

(seductive)
Its a bridesmaids dress Someone
loved it intensely for one day then
tossed it Like a Christmas tree --

abandoned on the side of the road
tinsel still clinging to it

Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on presses
against the counter Marla pulls her hemline further up

MARLA
Like sex crime victims underwear

tape

JACK
(coldly)
It suits you

She leans in very close to Jacks ear whispers hoarsely

MARLA

Jack watches her through the kitchen window

TYLER (0S)
Nice work

Jack turns Tylers right behind him Through the window
Marla can be seen walking away Tyler picks up the remnant
of SOAP Jacks been using holds it up to Jack

TYLER
To make soap first we have to render

DUMPSTER one of DOZENS A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD
moves along the perimeter flashlight first He walks away

eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster

TYLER
The best fat for making soap --
because the salt balance is just

right -- comes form human bodies
Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS
JACK

What is this place

TYLER
A liposuction clinic

From the dumpster Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized
thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO

TYLER
Paydirt From societys richest
asses and thighs

BAGS of fat One of Jacks bags RIPS spilling the goo down

TYLER
As the fat renders the tallow floats
to the surface Remember the crap
they taught you in Boy Scouts
JACK
Hard to imagine you in Boy Scouts

TYLER
This clear layer in glycerin Well
mix it back in when we make the soap

Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot lifts up a scoop of the
glycerin layer Then he crabs a can opens it

TYLER

Lye -- the crucial ingredient

(adding lye to mix)
Ancient peoples found their clothes
got cleaner if they washed them at a
certain spot in the river Why
Because human sacrifices were once
made on the hills above this river
Year after year bodies burnt Rain
feel Water seeped through the wood
ashes to become lye The lye
combined with the melted fat of the
bodies till a thick white soapy
discharge crept into the river

Tyler licks his lips until theyre gleaming wet He takes
Jacks hands and KISSES the back of it

TYLER
The first soap was made from the
ashes of heroes Like the first
monkeys shot into space

The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss Tyler pours a
bit of the flaked lye onto Jacks hand

TYLER
Without sacrifice without death we
would have nothing

Jacks whole body JERKS Tyler holds tight to Jacks hand
and arm Tears well in Jacks eyes his face tightens

TYLER
This is a chemical burn It will
hurt more than youve ever been
burned and you will have a scar

Tylers kiss Jacks face spasms

Come back to the pain Dont shut
this out

Jack snapping back tries to jerk his hand away Tyler
keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table

JACK (VO)
I tried not to think of the words
searing or flesh I imagined my
pain as a ball of healing white light

Listen to me You have to consider
the possibility that God doesnt like
you he never wanted you In all
probability He hates you This is
not the worst thing that can happen

special place and no special
attention and so be it

Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes Jack does his best
to stifle his spasms of pain his body a quivering coiled
knot He bolts toward the sink but Tyler holds on

TYLER
You can go to the sink and run water
over your hand Look at me Or you
can use vinegar to neutralize the
burn but first you have to give up
First you have to know that someday
you are going to die Until you know
that you will be useless

Jack spasms with a shiver of pain

JACK
You you dont know what this
feels like Tyler

Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand
Tears begin to drip from Jacks eyes Tyler grabs a bottle

of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jacks wound
