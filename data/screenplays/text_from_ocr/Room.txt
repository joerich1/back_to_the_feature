INT ROOM - NIGHT 1

Darkness The faint background hum of a refrigerator A light
clicks on briefly then snaps off again

Then on again for a little longer

We wake groggily with JACK (five) blinking up at MA Shes standing in a worn t-shirt and underwear beside a lamp
switching it on and off at apparently random intervals She
cranes up at the recessed skylight Rooms only window

The irregular flashes of lamp-light reveal glimpses of this
little world lined with cork ten foot a side seven foot
high gabled ceiling rising to ten foot

Clusters of Jacks and Mas vivid drawings are pinned all
over the walls quivering in the draft from the vents Done
with five crayons (red yellow blue orange green) and
pencil on toilet tissue lined pages or cardboard they show
dogs trees aliens rocket ships figures labelled Jack or
Ma Delicate mobiles (uncooked spaghetti threads
plastics foil down from pillows cloth scraps) dangle

A wardrobe with slatted louver doors On top toys crafted
from garbage a Labyrinth from toilet-roll insides

A dresser with a TV A homemade pack of cards papier maché
checkers and chess A Fort constructed from vitamin and other
bottles and cans A single meagre African violet in a pot on
the TV

A round dining table two fold-up chairs side by side
A bath with a single small towel over the side

A toilet with a flotilla of homemade toy boats floating in
the tank which is oddly missing a lid

A sink with a single worn toothbrush toothpaste dish soap
a broken comb folded rags for washcloths A small square of
mirror tile hung up over it

A small kitchen cabinet A dish rack two each of big and
small white plates bowls tumblers knives forks spoons
(one with a melted handle) a scissors can opener serrated
knife wooden spoon spatula

A basic stove (with more folded rags on its handle for pot
holders) one frying pan and one saucepan

A small refrigerator (more toys on top) a tiny trash

( )
1
A rocker Above a shelf Ten books stacked Homemade toys
A reddish Persian-style rug on the floor

A grey steel door no handle On the wall a ten-digit
keypad with a red light like a watching eye

Ma looks over at Jack and sees that hes awake She mouths
Sh at him soothing him back to sleep Keeps signalling

Darkness again as Jacks eyelids fall

TITLE ROOM

INT ROOM - DAY 2

Faint light Jack and Ma sleep face to face in a double bed
under a thin quilt Pale skin long hair wearing t-shirts

JACK (VO)

You cried all day and left TV on
till you were a zombie But then I
zoomed down from heaven through
Skylight into Room -

(makes noise of descent

inside boom boom and then I shot
out onto Rug with my eyes wide
open and you cutted the cord and
said “Hello Jack”

Jack wakes

Ma cant hide her revulsion at Dylan the Digger again

MA
Come on you can read Dylan

JACK

Ma recites animatedly Jack turns the board pages not

She checks her watch nervously getting close to nine

MA
Jack it’s late Come on

Jack jumps in and snuggles down Pictures of Dora and her
monkey Boots are glued on the back wall this is a tiny room
within Room Ma covers him up for the night

She begins to sing ‘The Big Rock Candy Mountain’

INT ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT 12
A little later Dim light comes through the slats Jack lies
stroking the dangling clothes the pictures glued to the
wardrobe He freezes at the sound of the beeps that mean the
outside door is about to open

He lies absolutely still listening for Old Nicks entrance
He savors the scent of fresh air but shivers winter

Boom now the doors shut again

OLD NICK (0S)
Hey

12

MA (0S)
Hey

Jack goes up on his elbow to squint through the slats but
only sees a bit of the mans down jacket as he takes it off

OLD NICK (0S)
Heres the jeans

MA (0OS)
Thanks

OLD NICK (0S)
The grapes were way too much so I
got canned pears

Jack can see Ma as she puts groceries away

MA
OK

Now OLD NICK moves into view too Forties solidly built
blue-collar a ordinary monster

OLD NICK
Whats that A birthday cake

He cuts himself a piece and eats it in a few bites
Ma starts getting undressed
OLD NICK (CONTD)
Shoulda told me Id have brought
him a present
Jack twitches at this thrilling possibility

Old Nick starts undressing too like some dull marriage

OLD NICK (CONTD)
Whats he now four

Jack in the wardrobe is all agog for Ma to correct him
JACK
(too low to be heard)
Five

Sounds of the adults getting into bed The lamp clicking off

Then the familiar creaks of the bed Jack doesnt know what
they mean but is troubled He counts them under his breath

JACK (CONTD)
One two three four

JACK (VO)
Theres Room then Outer Space
then Heaven Plant is real but not
trees Spiders are real and one
time the mosquito that was sucking
my blood But squirrels and dogs
are just TV except Lucky my dog
that might be some day Mountains
are too big to be real and the sea

In the dark of the wardrobe Jack is still counting

JACK
One twenty-eight one twenty-
nine

JACK (VO)

TV persons are flat and made of
colors with red mouths and clothes
instead of skin but me and you are
real Old Nick I dont know if
hes real maybe half Green beans
are real and chocolate but not ice
cream

The bedsprings are speeding up

JACK
Three hundred six seven eight -

A primal grunt from Old Nick The creaking is done Jack is

asleep at the bottom of the wardrobe

Old Nick goes over to the TV and switches on sports

MA
Shh

He turns down the volume The sound of the sports broadcast
overlaps with the thud of the door closing The wardrobe door
opens admitting the faint light of the LED on the keypad

We cut to a shot of Ma putting a sleeping Jack into the bed
As she starts to climb in beside we pull back and crane up

INT ROOM - DAY

Next morning Jack watches a nature programme on TV time-

lapse photography of one glorious tree

13

Ma is using a needle and thread to take in Jack’s new much-
too-big jeans Jack finds a trodden cigarette butt under the
corner of the rug Old Nick must have brought it in on his
shoe Jack studies it

TV NARRATOR (VO)
Fallen leaves decompose and return
nutrients to the soil

MA
(to herself referring to
the jeans)
Cheap piece of

Jack looks at the sad African violet on the bedside table

JACK
Why Plant doesnt make flowers
anymore

MA

Maybe shes tired

INT ROOM - DAY 14

Jack on the bed he squirms twists bounces with intense
boyish energy

Beside the bed now he runs on the spot at maximum speed In
the background we see Ma cooking

OMITTED 15

INT ROOM - DAY 16
Later the same day Ma is napping Jack is playing on the
floor Counting things Tracing the patterns of rug with his
finger

What was that He stares at the floor by the stove glimpses
something

Jack tiptoes over but the moving thing is gone He looks
furtively at Ma then takes out the cake He crumbles some and
sets the plate on the floor He squats and waits

A mouse puts its nose out sniffs and takes a crumb
Something smashes into the stove one of Ma’s heavy books

Jack cries out in shock and distress

JACK
You made him gone

Ma starts to sweep up the crumbs

JACK (CONTD)
He was an alive thing he was real

MA
Theyd steal our food

She crawls under the counter finds the hole Tears aluminum
foil from the roll Scrunches it

JACK
Mouse can have my food Im not
hungry

MA
Theyd bring in germs bite us in
the night

JACK
Mouse is my friend and you splatted
him dead

MA

No I didnt hes hunky-dory
She stops blocking up the hole to hug Jack

JACK
Are you just tricking me

MA
I swear hes safe at home with his
Ma in the backyard

JACK
What backyard

Ma realizing her slip tidies up instead of answering

JACK (CONTD)
Mouse lives in a yard in TV

Ma holds up the aluminum foil to distract him

MA
Hey lets make a UFO with this

Jack brings out the other grudge hes been nursing
JACK
Why you didnt tell Old Nick it was
my birthday

MA
Because hes not our friend

JACK
He said hed brung me a present

MA
You shouldnt hear what he - Youre
meant to be asleep

JACK
I never had a present

MA
He didnt mean it

JACK
It might be Lucky my dog 16

MA
Jack We cant have a dog We
dont have room -—
(sees him misunderstand)
- space enough space - cooped up
in here with the barking the
scratching

JACK
Lucky wont scratch he promises

MA
There is no Lucky

JACK
Yeah there is

MA
Hes just made-up in your head
hes not real

Devastated Jack bursts into tears

Ma sits down beside him and strokes him

INT ROOM - NIGHT 17

That evening Jack sits in Mas lap watching a TALK-SHOW
hostess interview a one-armed war veteran Ma is threading
eggshells onto a string hundreds of shells long Jack gently
supports the unraveled part

Ma lets out a big yawn and discreetly rubs her aching jaw

HOSTESS
-most poignant aspect I can
speak for all our viewers so so
deeply moved by what you endured

JACK
Ma Where are we when were asleep

MA
Right here in Room

JACK
But dreams Do we go into TV for
dreaming

MA

JACK

They put down Eggsnake and Ma turns to him so he can
breastfeed

17A INT ROOM - NIGHT 17A

Ma lies on the bed Jack is nowhere to be seen Eventually
his voice comes from the wardrobe

JACK
Ma I think Old Nick lives in TV
like Mouse Thats where he goes
when hes not here in Room

MA
Jack Go to sleep

INT ROOM - DAY 18

The third morning Jack wakes up in the bed where Ma always
carries him once Old Nick has gone

Ma is up already sitting at the table staring at a shiny
red truck and remote in a hard pack The snake is in Eden

Jack can hardly believe what’s in front of him He looks at
it for a while

MA
You can open it

We watch as Jack opens the box Ma tries to help him when he
finds the packaging difficult

JACK
(pulling it away from her)
I can do it

Later Jack is playing with his new toy Ma watches him
uneasily We hear a faint echo of screaming

CHAPTER TITLE UNLYING The screaming get’s louder

Later Ma is standing on a chair screaming and howling at the
Skylight Jack stands in the bath screaming into the small
air vent above the shelf He holds his truck up to the vent
so it can join in

Then they hush and listen

JACK (CONTD)
Why the aliens never scream back

MA
I guess they still cant hear us

JACK
Tomorrow well do even louderer

Later Ma preoccupied trims mold off cheese she slices very
thin and lays on brown bread Puts it in the toaster oven

Jack zigzags his truck around chair and table legs Ma checks
to see if the frozen peas are boiling yet Jack drives the
truck at the door clang

MA
Jack

18

JACK
What smells bad

Ma belatedly realizes the grilled cheese is smoking

She burns her hand slightly on the oven wrenching it open
19 INT ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT 19

That evening Jack in the wardrobe is meant to be asleep
but he’s still playing with his truck

The door beeps he kneels up for a glimpse as it booms shut

OLD NICK (0S)
Hey Whats the smell

He puts down groceries unzips his jacket

MA (0OS)
Sorry I burned some cheese

OLD NICK (0S)
You need to take more care

MA (0S)

OLD NICK
Yeah well thinkings not your

MA (0OS)

Ma is unpacking the groceries

OLD NICK
So did he like his truck

He laughs at her speechless discomfort

OLD NICK (CONTD)
I know boys I was one once

Ma looks at the empty bag

MA
The vitamins

OLD NICK
Waste of money

MA
If we had a better diet maybe

OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING)
Here we go again You know instead
of complaining maybe you should
thank your lucky stars you’ve got a
place like this Cosy safe
specially with the kid - no drunk
drivers drug-pushers perverts

MA
I’m sorry

OLD NICK
Like pulling teeth sometimes

Ma waits for him to calm down

OLD NICK (CONTD)
Your problem is you have no idea
about the world of today

MA
No

OLD NICK
Who pays the power bills Who pays
for everything

She gives the required answer

MA
You

OLD NICK
And where do you think the moneys
going to keep coming from

MA
What do you mean

OLD NICK
Nothing

MA
No but -

OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING)
Six months Ive been laid off have
you had to worry your little head

Pause as Ma takes in the implications of this She proceeds
cautiously 19

MA
What are you going to do

He doesnt answer

MA (CONTD)
Are you looking for another job

OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING)
What job There are no damn jobs
Jesus Christ

Jack frightened shrinks back in the wardrobe knocking into
the back panel Old Nick turns his attention to the wardrobe

OLD NICK (CONTD)
Hey in there

MA
Hes asleep

OLD NICK
Dont think so You keep him in the
closet all day as well as all
night Poor little freak has two
heads or something

He roots in his jacket pockets and produces an already opened
tube of hard candy

OLD NICK (CONTD)
Hey Jack You like candy Wanna
come out and have some candy
Jack tempted reaches for the door

Desperate to distract Old Nick Ma touches his arm

MA
Lets go to bed

Old Nick chuckles at this unaccustomed seductiveness

MA (CONTD)

Now
OLD NICK
Didnt your Momma ever teach you
manners
MA
Please 19
Pocketing the candy he wraps himself round her
They edge backwards out of view

The lamp snaps off

INT ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT 20
A little later everything is quiet Moonlight

Jack asleep in a crooked position wakes with a jump He
sits up and rubs his neck Finds his truck He opens the door
and peeks out Wheres the candy

INT ROOM - NIGHT 21
Stepping out holding his truck for moral support Jack

stumbles into something and gasps He picks it up a thick
leather belt like a cobra

21
He takes another few steps and stubs his toe on a huge boot
Jack stares at Old Nick asleep in the middle of the bed

Ma is sleeping too clinging to the far side

Now hes come this far Jack forgets the candy fascinated by
Old Nick whom hes seeing up close for the first time

Jack puts his finger out almost touching Old Nicks face
Old Nicks eyes open startled Then he grins

OLD NICK
Hey sonny

Ma leaps up screaming and flailing at Old Nick

MA
Get away from him Get away

Jack drops his truck and races to the wardrobe

He jumps in and pulls the door banging his head

INT ROOM - WARDROBE - NIGHT 22

Jack clutches his head curled up in the corner of the
wardrobe because it hurts and to shut out Mas screeching

OLD NICK (0S)
Stop that noise

Ma is suddenly muted The thump of Old Nick throwing her down
on the bed The lamp snaps on Jack flinches and turns his
face away from the light

OLD NICK (0S) (CONTD)
Of all the crazy

Sound of him pulling his clothes on kicking the truck away
MA (0S)
(hoarsely)
Just leave him alone
The door makes the three beeps
OLD NICK (0S)

Just dont forget where you got
him

22

Sound of the door opening then shutting with a boom Jack
waits to hear what Ma will do or say to him

The lamp clicks off again darkness Jack dives out of the
wardrobe
INT ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 23

JACK
Sorry I - sorry - sorry -

He sobs and hyperventilates by the side of the bed

JACK (CONTD)
Sorry I came out of Wardrobe

Ma takes him into bed with her

MA
Its OK
She soothes him
INT ROOM - DAY 24

Shot of ice-crystals on the skylight Silence no
refrigerator hum

Jack wakes first shivering though he doesnt know why He
is astonished by purple bruises around Mas throat As if she
feels his gaze Ma wakes and musters a smile Jack notices
the white clouds of their breath in the air

JACK
Ma were dragons

Ma sits up Registers the chill Getting out of bed she
turns on the lamp no light Jack is crushed to finds his
Jeep one wheel snapped off

Ma opens the refrigerator dark inside Shes appalled

MA
Hes cut the power

She glances at the keypad its little red light is out
With a wild illogical hope she hurls herself at the door

and claws at its edges - but its still locked Jack watches
bewildered hes never seen her try to open it

INT ROOM - DAY

Jack is at the table reading to his injured truck from ALICE
Both are dressed in all their clothes in an effort to keep

warm

JACK
For you see so many out-of-the-
way things had happened lat-ely -

MA
Lately

JACK
- lately that Alice had begun to
think that very few things indeed
were really impossible

Ma comes to the table and doles out half-thawed green beans

MA
Lunch

JACK
No thanks

MA

We have to use them up before they
rot Once we eat well feel warmer

Jack makes himself chew a limp bean Ma nibbles a few with a
show of enthusiasm Jack looks at his three-wheeled truck

JACK
Whens Old Nick going to put the
power back

MA
Soon

JACK
Whens soon

25 25

MA
Once hes not mad with me anymore

Jack watches the bruises on her throat move

JACK
I hope he never comes back not
ever

MA

Jack Think about it
He does with difficulty

JACK
No Sunday Treat

MA
No anything
Jack tries the bean again - then spits it out quietly Ma
watches him kisses him forces herself to begin telling him
the truth

MA (CONTD)
Hey Jack Remember the mouse

JACK
My friend Mouse

MA
You know where he is right now

Jack looks all around Room

MA (CONTD)
On the other side of this wall

Jack stares hard at the wall

JACK
What other side
MA
Oh Jack everything has two sides
JACK
Not an octagon
MA
No thats -

25 25

JACK (OVERLAPPING)
An octagon has eight

Ma holds up her hand flat

MA
But a walls like this And were
on the inside in Room and Mouse

JACK
In Outer Space

MA
No in the world Its much closer
than Outer Space

She shows him the distance with her hands

JACK (OVERLAPPING)
I dont see any outside side

MA
But if we were outside in the
world we would wed be looking at
the other side of this wall and
Mouse lying in the grass with his
Ma Wed see trees and cars and -

JACK (OVERLAPPING)
Grass is just TV

MA
Is it though You know when Door
opens and the air comes in the air
that smells fresher - thats grass

Jack tries to laugh

JACK
You cant smell TV

MA
But its not TV Its the real
world we smell Youre so smart I
know youve started wondering

25 25
Jack shakes his head

MA (CONTD)
Where do you think Old Nick gets
our food

JACK
From TV by magic

MA
Theres no magic Everything we see
on TV - its pictures of real stuff
and real people in the world

JACK
Doras real for real

MA
No sorry not Dora shes just a
picture but the other ones with
faces like ours - and theres real
streets and oceans dogs cats -

JACK (OVERLAPPING)
No way Where would they all fit

MA
Just out there in the world

Jack tired of this changes the subject

JACK
Can I have a sandwich

Controlling her exasperation Ma gets out a half slice of

bread and adds a rationed scraping of peanut butter She sets
down his food and he comes to the table to eat it 25

Ma stands with her hands in her armpits to warm them She
stares around as if for proof Cranes up at the skylight

MA
Look A leaf

JACK
Where

MA

On skylight

She climbs up on a chair and lifts Jack onto her shoulders so
he can see His head is close to the recessed skylight He
looks at a brown sodden half-rotted leaf

JACK
Dumbo Ma That’s not a leaf Leaves
are green

MA
On the trees they are but when they
fall they rot like salad in the
fridge they -

JACK
(interrupting)
Wheres all the stuff you said
Trees and dogs and -

MA (OVERLAPPING)
Well we cant see them from here
because the skylight looks upwards
instead of sideways

Jack suddenly struggles to get down nearly toppling them

JACK (OVERLAPPING)
Youre just tricking me

MA
No Im not

JACK
Liar liar pants on fire

MA
Jack I couldnt explain before
you were too small to understand
so I had to make up a story
(MORE) 25
MA (CONTD)
But now - its the opposite of
lying Im unlying because now
youre five I think you can
understand about the world you
have to understand

Jack shakes his head not in bewilderment but in resistance

MA (CONT’D)
Jack -

JACK
I want to be four again

They face each other standing with the table between them
Ma musters the energy to try again telling him her own story
this time She picks up Jack’s copy of ALICE IN WONDERLAND

MA
You know how Alice wasnt always in
Wonderland

JACK
She fell down down down the hole

MA
Well Im like Alice I wasnt
always in Room

A heavy silence as Jack absorbs this

MA (CONTD)
I used to be a little girl called
Joy I lived-

JACK (OVERLAPPING)
Nah

MA
I lived in a house out in the world
(taps on the wall)
- with my mom and dad Youd call
them Grandma and Grandpa

JACK
What house

MA
The house where we lived with a
hammock in the back yard We used
to swing in the hammock and eat ice
cream

No answer 25

JACK
A TV house

MA

Another long miserable pause Jack angry and upset watches
her for a while then sits down on the floor and takes out his
toys from under the TV He plays quietly

Ma looks up at the skylight As she watches a gust of wind
blow the leaf away

LATER - dusk

Ma and Jack are in bed under the duvet in their clothes
shuddering with cold Jack tries the lamp Nothing He fixes
the dents in the shade then lies back down A terrible

flatness in the air Ma is turned away from Jack She has
been crying

26 OMITTED 26

INT ROOM - DAY
Next morning a sunny day Jack wakes up beside Ma

JACK
Its warm again

But she pulls the pillow over her head

He knows its one of her rare catatonic Gone days

27
Later Jack eats cereal and watches DORA (sound on very low)
DORA AND BOOTS
Where do we go next River Bridge
Highest Hill Will you check my
backpack for something to help us

Later TV off Jack creeps up to Ma and studies what he can
see of her bruises which are more purple-black today

He tries to read Mas watch but the angle makes it hard
He plays at switching Ma on with the remote

Later Jack plays chess (with their homemade papier maché
set) against his truck

Later Kicks a shrivelled red balloon to keep it in the air

Later Its turned cloudy Jack nibbles a bagel at the table

Later He makes a tour of his domain his friends

JACK (VO)

Eggsnakes our longest friend and
fanciest Meltedy Spoons the best
to eat with because hes more
blobbier Labyrinth is the
twistiest and she hides things so I
dont know where Toilets the best
at disappearing poo Lamps the
brightest except when the powercut

(glances at Ma)
Youre the best at reading and
songs and lots except if youre
having a Gone Day Im the best at
drawing and jumping and growing and
nearly everything

He examines the trucks broken axle Yanks on another wheel
until it snaps off Then the last two He twists the doors
off Stuffs the truck its parts and remote in the trash

Later light fading Jack lies beside Ma longing to
breastfeed Lifts the edge of her t-shirt but doesnt dare

He sits up rests his hand on the bump of Mas foot

INT ROOM - DAY 28

Next day Ma (apparently normal again) and Jack finish their
cereal

28

Apple
He takes a big bite and hands it back to her

Ma bites in winces She reaches into her mouth and pulls out
a tooth

MA (CONTD)
About time

JACK
Bad Tooth Can I have it

MA
Sure if you want it

INT ROOM - DAY 29

A little later Jack is watching wildlife while Ma cleans up
from breakfast baby turtles emerging from shells and heading
down the beach

Tying up the trash bag she finds the truck and realizes
that Jack has destroyed it because it came from Old Nick

JACK
Are turtles real

Mas head shoots up this is the first sign that hes
starting to believe her about the world

MA
Totally real I had a pet turtle

DAVID ATTENBOROUGH
Crocodiles sharks and hungry fish
are all waiting in the shallows

JACK
Crocodiles and sharks -

MA
Theyre all real

29 29

Curious Jack switches channels a 1970 BBC mini-series THE
SIX WIVES OF HENRY VIII

ANNE
Oh my lord

HENRY
(eyeing the child)
Not while he plays here
ANNE
(smiling)
Ill send him away -

JACK (OVERLAPPING)

MA
Ah theyre real people playing
dress-up pretending to be people
from hundreds of years ago
Jack is puzzled by that
He switches channels TOM AND JERRY

JACK
Just TV

MA
Youre getting it

He watches the slapstick violence with relish
JACK
When Old Nick comes back Im going
to kick him in the butt

This suddenly punctures her mood

MA
Jack

Ma marches over and turns off the TV startling him
MA (CONT’D)
One night I stood behind the door
with the lid of the toilet tank -

Jack looks towards it confused what lid

His eyes s

MA (CONTD)
- it used to have a lid it was the
heaviest thing in Room When he
came in I tried to smash it down on
his head But I messed up Jack
He shoved the door shut and grabbed
me by the wrist - that’s why it’s
sore now

JACK
We could wait till hes asleep and
kill him dead

MA
Yes we could but then wed have no
more food - and we wouldn’t know
the code on the door to get out

JACK
The Grandma and the Grandpa could
come

MA
They dont know where we are Jack
Rooms not on any map

lide to the blank screen

29 29

JACK
Can I have more TV
MA
Jack I want you to listen to me

Jack
He looks at her

MA (CONTD)
You’re old enough now and we can’t
wait any longer Jack you are
going to help me trick Old Nick
like Jack in the stories is always
tricking the giant

30 INT ROOM - DAY 30

A little later Water boils in a pot on the stove Jack lies
on the bed

MA
Im going to make your face so
scorching hot that Old Nick will
take you to the hospital in his
truck and the minute you get there
youll tell the doctors Help
Police

JACK
You can tell it

30

MA

Ill write you a note to give them
JACK

Jack jumps up rigid with panic

JACK
No No

MA
Itll be OK

JACK

MA

He wont take us both Youll go
first just to the hospital so you
can tell the police and then
Her conviction falters at this point but she fakes it

MA (CONTD)
Then youll come rescue me

He shakes his head

30 30

MA (CONTD)

Well be free Go on hikes see
birds Ride in cars and trains and
planes Ill teach you to swim
Well have friends And a dog -

Jack thinks

JACK
Maybe next year when Im six

Mas face falls Then hardens

MA
Tonight

Jack starts shaking his head frantically

MA (CONTD)
It has to be tonight

Jack flees to the wardrobe to shut himself in

MA (CONTD)
Listen to me 30

She stops him before he can slam the louver doors

MA (CONTD)

Im going to tell him the powercut
made you so cold you got a fever
We might not get another chance
It’s a miracle he didn’t come last
night

JACK
Tomorrow

MA
Im your Ma Sometimes I have to
pick for both of us

Slowly she pulls till his small hands release the doors

INT ROOM - NIGHT 31

Later Jack is back on the bed his face red Ma holds a
cloth wrung out with hot water over his forehead

JACK
Ow

MA
You need to feel hot when he
touches you

Jack starts crying at the prospect Ma strokes him as she
presses the bag to his forehead

MA (CONTD)
Cryings good it makes you look
sicker
Then she moves the bag to each cheek in turn
MA (CONTD)

And stay floppy remember Youre
too weak to move or say a word

31
She shoves her fingers down her throat to make her retch

JACK
What are you doing

Ma manges to vomit a little
She rubs it on the pillow beside Jack which horrifies him

MA
Makes you smell sick

Ma checks her watch and presses the cloth to his face
MA (CONTD)
Remember when you get to the
hospital you give them the note
Show me how you hold it out

Jack fumbles in his pocket for the edge of the note
Something falls out with it

MA (CONT’D)
What’s that

She picks it up Her bad tooth She gives it back to him
MA (CONTD)
See thats a bit of me you have

with you all the time

JACK
Im scared

Ma strokes his face

I know 31
The door beeps startling them both

Ma shoves the wet rag and the pot of hot water under the bed
Jack hides his red face in the pillow goes limp

The door opens and Old Nick steps in with a grocery bag

MA (CONTD)
There you are

He scowls at her and shoulders the door shut
OLD NICK
You know the drill not a peep out
of you till the doors shut

MA
Sorry just - Jacks really bad

Old Nick puts the groceries down grimacing at the smell

MA (CONTD)
It was so cold

OLD NICK
You brought that on yourself

MA
I couldnt keep him warm and now
hes burning

OLD NICK
Give him one of those painkillers

MA
Ive tried he pukes them back up

Old Nick comes up close to Jack

MA (CONTD)
Dont -

He elbows her out of the way lays his hand across Jack’s
forehead

Jack lets out a whimper of fear that passes for pain

OLD NICK
Ill get him something stronger 31

MA
Hes only five Dehydrated
temperature this high he could go
into convulsions any minute

OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING)
Shut up and let me think

MA
He needs antibiotics

OLD NICK
Ill bring something tomorrow
night

MA
Tomorrow night You have to take
him to the ER right now

OLD NICK
Enough with the hysterics

MA
Im begging you Please

Old Nick taps the code into the keypad hiding his hand Ma
clings to him

MA (CONT’D)
If youre even halfway human -

As the door opens he thrusts her away and she stumbles

When the door booms shut Jack lifts his head Their trick
didnt work and hes relieved Ma is crumpled against the
wall where she fell

INT ROOM - NIGHT 32

Jack sleeps sweetly and peacefully in Mas arms in bed

She stares into the dark
INT ROOM - DAY 33

Next morning Jack is eating his cereal cheerfully Ma
hollow-eyed hasnt touched hers

33

MA
So Edmond pulls his friends body
out of the bag and hides it and he
climbs into the bag and lies super
still until the guards come

Jack nods enjoying the familiar story

MA (CONT’D)
And thats what youre going to do

He stops eating

MA (CONTD)
See Its even tricksier than
pretending to be sick this time
youre going to be dead

Jack looks over at the folded paper grocery bags

JACK
(with relief)
Our bags are too small for being
dead in

Ma shoves the table and chairs away to one side

JACK (CONTD)
Is it time for Track

Ma starts hauling up the rug testing how it bends

MA
Rugs going to be the bag see

JACK
I dont want to be dead

MA
Pretending to be dead thats all
Wrapped up so Old Nick cant see
that youre alive But not floppy
this time All stiff like a robot
And not a sound And Ill be in
your head talking to you all the
time

(she taps Jacks head)
(MORE)

MA (CONTD)
Hes going to carry you outside

MA (0S) (CONT’D)

Jack holds himself rigid as Ma lifts him up

MA (0S) (CONTD)

MA (0S) (CONT’D)
The second you hear the engine -

She makes engine noises and shakes him

Jack clenches his teeth and starts to writhe and roll side to
side

He rolls over face down and gets his butt slightly in the
air bending the cylinder of the rug

He rolls the other way sits up the rug opens He claws his
way out his face red and smeared Ma is looking almost as
distraught as him but she grins

MA (CONTD)

JACK

MA

for hours Ma crouches beside him drilling him in the plan

JACK
Truck wriggle out Jump Run -

JACK (CONTD)

JACK (CONTD)
Sing

Ma kneels back up into position

MA
One evening as the sun went down
and the jungle fire was burning
down the track came a hobo hikin
and he said Boys Im not turning
Im headed for a land thats far
away beside the crystal fountains
So come with me well go and see
the Big -

The door beeps and Ma rolls Jack up very fast Were in the
dark with him the rug pressing close

Sound of Old Nick stepping in Proud of himself

OLD NICK (0S)
Antibiotics

The door shuts with a boom
OLD NICK (0S) (CONTD)
Are you nuts wrapping a sick kid
up in that

Mas voice is very close because shes bent over the rug

MA (0S)
He got worse in the night

She waits giving Old Nick time to figure it out
In the rug Jack lies frozen except for his flickering eyes

MA (0S) (CONT’D)
He wouldnt wake up

34 34

OLD NICK (0S)
Are you sure

She lets seven years of rage pour out

MA (0S)
Am I sure

In the rug Jack blinks in fright

OLD NICK (0S)
Ah gee Thats - Poor girl

His self-justification kicks in right away
OLD NICK (0S) (CONTD)
Guess it must have been serious

pills wouldnt have worked anyway

MA (0S)
You killed my baby

OLD NICK (0S)

Jacks eyes squeeze tightly shut total darkness

MA (OVERLAPPING) (0S)
Keep your hands off him

OLD NICK (0S)

Jack opens his eyes again inside the rug

OLD NICK (0S)(CONT’D)
He cant stay here you know

MA

MA (0S)

OLD NICK (0S)

MA
(screams at him)
Now I can’t bear it

OLD NICK
OK OK

Jack feels himself being scooped up by Old Nick

MA (0OS)
Gently

OLD NICK (0S)
Get back and turn around

Jack is tilted head down as Old Nick taps the code Ma starts
to moan quietly A swaying motion as he carries Jack outside

Mas voice is cut off by the boom of the door

35 EXT OLD NICKS HOUSE - BACK YARD - DUSK 35

Were with Jack glimpses of twilight sky shrubs hedge
through the end of the carpet

A terrible pause as Old Nick contemplates the back yard Then
walks on Jack is heaved face-down into the flatbed of an old
pick-up

A pause - Jack senses a light going on nearby Then the clang
of a shovel being dropped onto the bed of truck beside the
rug

Old Nicks footsteps heading for the drivers seat Sound of
the truck rumbling to life
36 EXT STREET NEAR OLD NICKS - DUSK 36
Sound and shaking the truck roars along too fast

Were with Jack stunned face-down in the darkness

36
At last he remembers that hes meant to be wriggling out
He writhes but the rug has tightened in transit

With an effort Jack manages to roll over No better

The engine quietens as the truck slows Jack is not sure if
thats his signal and anyway hes still trapped in the rug

The truck doesnt stop at the stop sign only slows

Jack remembers his arm He forces it above his head wincing
as the rug scrapes the skin off his elbow Jack puts all his
misery into movement thrashing about kicking jack-knifing
like a dying fish

The trucks engine lulls as it makes a rolling stop

Jack feels the rug slide a little across the flatbed which
gives him just enough momentum that he bends with a deep

grunt and the rug starts to roll open

He bursts out on hands and knees like a birth Elbow and
lip bloody face covered in hair snot and tears

The world hits Jack street lamps wind in his face shocking
colors of the sunset Trees and houses looming and then
receding like a rollercoaster

His glance falls on the shovel meant for his grave

Jacks eyes focus on the cab of the truck and what he
realizes must be the back of Old Nicks head driving

Old Nick slows at the third stop and swings right Jack is
flung headlong banging his leg on the left of the flatbed

The truck screeches to a stop because Old Nick heard the
noise and glimpsed Jack in his rearview mirror

He flings the drivers door open

Jack scrabbles over to the opposite side

Old Nick jumps down and strides around the truck

Jack leaps down to the tarmac bloodying his left knee His
jaw smashes into his right knee He picks a direction at

random and tears away from the truck stumbles keeps going

A large dog on a long leash emerges from a yard

DOUG(a big man in his forties) and his 2-year-old daughter

CARRIE both in winter outdoor clothes follow

Jack runs into the man finds himself on the ground with the

dog snarling at him

DOUG
Boomer

He pulls the dog away by the collar

Old Nick catches up and scoops Jack up with one arm

Pinned in the air Jack lashes out in soundless terror

Nick strides back towards the truck with him

DOUG (CONTD)
Excuse me Hey

Old Nick puts Jack down but holds his shoulders
Jack cringes eyes on the ground
DOUG (CONT’D)
Im so sorry Is your little girl

OK

OLD NICK
Its under control

Doug stares at Jacks bloody knee elbow lip
DOUG
She been in some kind of accident

You want me to call someone

OLD NICK
I’1ll take care of it

old

Jack cant speak but pulls out the note Old Nick snatches

it out of his hand scrunching it

DOUG
What’s that you got there honey

OLD NICK (OVERLAPPING)
Why dont you mind your own
business and I’1l mind mine

DOUG
OK I dont like this

36 36 36

He pulls out his cellphone and dials Old Nick picks up Jack
again and hurries to his truck

Doug waits impatiently for the emergency operator
DOUG
(shouts after Old Nick)
Ive got your plates mister K93 -

Old Nick drops Jack in the street and breaks into a run

DOUG (CONTD)
Hey Hey

Jack lying in a heap hears the drivers door slam

Then the engine starts Jack looks around the truck is
barrelling towards him Confused and dizzy he crawls towards
the sidewalk The truck roars past a getaway not attempted
murder

Jack watches the truck zoom through the next stop

He collapses and blinks up at the vast evening sky After a
beat Doug leaning in interrupts the view The dog is

there too

DOUG (CONTD)
It’s OK Honey

Jack curls himself up in a ball

INT STREET NEAR OLD NICKS - DUSK 37
A patrol car pulls up at the scene Doug leaves the still
curled up Jack and hurries to the car to talk to the emerging
OFFICER GRABOWSKI

Jack shuddering with cold notices Carrie staring at him

He feels his lip touches the blood looks at it tastes
Then sees an oval on the ground He picks it up a leaf

OFFICER PARKER a female officer hunkers down beside him
OFFICER PARKER

himself to talk to one of these alien beings - but barely
whispering and he cant look her in the eye

He remembers Bad Tooth and takes it out of his mouth

OFFICER PARKER

JACK
A bit of Ma

Both officers peer at Bad Tooth and exchange a dark look

She closes her eyes and fixes the geometry of Jack’s journey
in her mind

OFFICER PARKER (CONT’D)
(on her walkie-talkie)
Control Listen carefully South on
Maple three stop signs from the

garden shed with a skylight

Officer Grabowski impressed swings the car around

INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT 39

Minutes later Outside an unlit house with a Police van and
a back-up unmarked car parked facing the other way A plain
clothes OFFICER is knocking on the front door of the house
Jack watches through the car window as Officer Parker
consults with an OLDER WHITE MALE OFFICER also plain
clothes Parker and the older officer start to poke around
the side of the house disappearing for a moment before
running back Officer Parker takes what looks like a crowbar
from the trunk of the car She draws her weapon Grabowski
moves to leave the car

OFFICER PARKER
Stay with the boy

She disappears around the back of the house Jack
hyperventilates thinking about Old Nick and Ma

OFFICER GRABOWSKI
(eyes Jack in mirror)
You OK kid

We hear shouting a crack of splitting wood Jack starts
clawing at the car door cant find the handle

OFFICER GRABOWSKI (CONT’D)
Hey hey take it easy

A figure hurtles towards the car Ma She cant get the door
open either because of the lock

Faces pressed to the glass she and Jack almost touch Then
at last the door is open and Jack is in her arms

INT POLICE CAR - NIGHT 40

A little later Jack and Ma in blankets hold each other as
the police cruiser moves through the night

Jack does a huge yawn utterly exhausted now the adrenalin is
gone

JACK

INT HOSPITAL - MA AND JACKS SUITE - DAY 45

Next morning A bright hospital room Jack and Ma share the
fancy hospital bed A cot bed unused has been set up to one
side Jack is awake but content to lie close to Ma for a
while - studying the dials and switches on the wall above his
head He looks at Ma asleep bruises fading to yellow-green
He sits up and pulls back the sheet Hes wearing only a pair
of underpants from Room which look particularly wretched in
this new antiseptic environment He touches the part of the
mattress he’s being lying on It’s damp He examines a
bandage on his knee He gets up On a side table he sees a
plate with the remains of some toast on it and a half drunk
cup of tea He sniffs at the food There are two surgical
masks there also He walks slowly to the opposite wall his
little figure silhouetted against the translucent blinds He
stops in front of the one window which has its blind drawn
The hospital suite is high up and the view is spectacular

45 45

From the back we study Jacks small figure and beyond it the
vast world below 45

Coming around on Jacks face we see that he is trying to make
sense of what he’s seeing It takes him a moment to realize
what he’s looking at and how high above ground he is His
breathing quickens and he turns and scurries back to bed

He shakes his mom

JACK
Ma Ma

She begins to wake

MA
Good morning sleepy head I was
waiting so long for you to wake I
fell back asleep

JACK
Is this another planet

MA
Same one just a different bit
Its a room -
(hears the word)
A bedroom in a hospital

Jack thinks about this

Beat

JACK
Are we sick for real or pretend
MA
Were not sick Were the opposite
of sick
JACK

How long are we staying

MA
Not long Grandma saw us last night
and she’1ll take us when they say

JACK

45A 45

MA
Thats OK

The bedside phone bursts to life frightening Jack Ma picks
it up

MA (CONT’D (CONTD)
Yes just now OK if that’s OK
thank you

Ma hangs up as Jack starts tugging the sheets off the bed
She stops him

MA (CONTD)
Don’t worry about that Someone
will wash it Come on we have to
get ready

Ma steps out of bed Shes wearing a robe It says ‘Tyler
Forest Hospital’

JACK
Whats that

MA
Do you like it There’s one for
you too
She picks up a robe from beside the bed puts him in it -

it’s way too big then she begins to take off his damp
underpants

INT HOSPITAL - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 45A

Ma and Jack come into the bathroom Ma throws Jack’s
underpants in the trash

JACK
Thats waste

MA
Well get new ones

JACK
For Sunday Treat

MA
There are going to be so many
treats not just on Sundays

Jack looks around

45A 45A

JACK
Where’s the bath

MA
Its a shower instead Splashier

Ma notices a large mirror This is the first time she’s seen

herself properly in 7 years She studies herself - bares her
teeth She points out their reflections to Jack

45A 45A

MA (CONTD)
Jack look It’s us

This is the first time Jack has ever properly seen himself

JACK
Ma will he find us

MA
No he will never ever come again

INT HOSPITAL - MA AND JACKS SUITE - BATHROOM - DAY 46

Ma and Jack are in the shower Jack is pressed to the door
as far away as possible from the powerful jet of water

JACK
Bath before Bed

She cant hear him over the noise of the water

MA
What

JACK
Bath before Bed thats the rule

MA
There arent any rules now Jack
We can do what we like

Jack is unnerved by all this

Ma groans with pleasure as she lets the water hit the back of
her neck

JACK
Are you hurting

Ma laughs Jack edges into the water and she washes him with
a hand towel

INT HOSPITAL —- MA AND JACK’S SUITE - MORNING 47
Both in robes with wet hair While Ma looks out the window
Jack noses around the room taking in the strange experience

of an unknown space He opens a drawer then another Empty

A very light tap at the door which only Jack hears

47

JACK
The doors ticking

The door opens a little Ma jumps Jack hides behind his
mother as a mans head - wearing a surgical mask - appears
around the door

DR MITTAL
Hello there I hear we’re all woken

up

MA
That’s right

Jacks buries his head in

MA (CONTD)
It’s OK Jack

DR MITTAL (thirtiesforties) come further into the room A
nurse pushes in a breakfast trolly then leaves

DR MITTAL
Hi there Jack I’m Dr Mittal You
were asleep when I cam in this
morning

Jack won’t make eye contact

DR MITTAL (CONT’D)
You must be hungry

No answer Dr Mittal moves the breakfast trolley in front of
Ma and Jack Ma removes the plastic domed lids and foil Jack
stares at the strange food He runs his finger around the
BLUE RIM OF HIS PLATE and looks at it to see if the color has
come off Ma eats

DR MITTAL (CONTD)
So I have some things for you
both

He hands 2 pairs of sunglasses to Ma

DR MITTAL (CONTD)
You may find it more comfortable to
wear these if you go outside Some
sunscreen

Holding up a surgical mask

DR MITTAL (CONT’D)
For Jack

47 47

MA
Is that really necessary

DR MITTAL

Lots of germs in the air to get
used to

(taking out some pills)
My colleague has prescribed these
for the pain in your wrist until we
can schedule a surgery

(handing over a last

bottle)
And something to help you sleep

47 47

MA
OK Thanks
(to Jack who is still
playing with his food)
Try it it’s delicioso

Jack’s not convinced

DR MITTAL
Have you thought any more about
what we discussed this morning

MA
Thanks for the offer but we’re
going to go home

DR MITTAL
You know my view After what you’ve
experienced and to assess Jack
properly And just to soften the
transition -

MA
(interrupting)
Nothing happened to Jack

DR MITTAL
I understand but even ata
cognitive-sensory level - depth
perception auditory processing

MA
But he’s OK right

DR MITTAL
The most important thing you did
was to get him out while he’s still
plastic

47 47

JACK
(whispers to Ma)
I’m not plastic

DR MITTAL
What’s that Jack

MA
He says he’s real not plastic

Mittal laughs
DR MITTAL

I can’t argue with that Jack Real
and very brave

47 47

We hear voices arguing outside the door One voice cuts
through

VOICE (0C)
Oh for Gods sake

DR MITTAL
We can talk about this again later
It sounds like you have more
important things to do right now

The door opens and Nancy enters (we met her briefly in the
emergency room) carrying an overnight bag She is followed by
aman in his sixties rumpled from travel This is ROBERT
Ma’s father

MA
Dad

ROBERT
My darling

They hug the masks are quickly discarded Dr Mittal watches
from the back of the room

NANCY
We couldn’t wait any longer 47

Jack forgotten is frightened by what he sees He curls up
Eventually Ma notices him

MA
Jack Jack it’s OK This is your
Grandma and Grandpa

NANCY
Hello Jack

Jack hides his face

NANCY (CONTD)
That’s OK Thanks for saving my
little girl Jack

Robert tries to smile but he is very uneasy around Jack
Nancy lifts the small bag she brought

NANCY (CONTD)
I hope I didn’t forget anything
I’m sure I did

EXT HOSPITAL - UPPER STOREY TERRACE - DAY 48

Hospital roof garden Jack sticks close to Ma She is dressed
in track-suit bottoms and her old warm winter coat Jack has
pajamas under his robe and a warm coat which doesn’t quite
fit Ma has a pair of her old boots on Jack has trainers
They wear tinted glasses against the brightness of the day
Jack is a strange sight the part of his face not covered by
his mask (the others are unmasked) or woollen hat is smeared
in heavy sun screen They sit with Robert and Nancy Nancy
smokes a slim cigarette Jack watches her cigarette for a
while then his attention is snagged by a nurse pushing an
old woman in a wheelchair He is also fascinated by the sky
reflected in the mirrored glass of the building

Ma runs her hand along her coat
NANCY
(off Ma’s clothes)
I kept everything

Jack is finding his shoes - the first hes ever worn -
irritating He starts to take them off

Pause

MA
Leave them Jack you’ll get used
to them 48

ROBERT
You’re here

They hug again Letting go at last they smile at each other
for a long moment We feel a history of great closeness
between them Ma wipes away her tears

MA
So what’s in Michigan

Robert and Nancy exchange glances

MA (CONTD)
(sensing something)

OK
She waits
ROBERT
I’m working out of the Grand Rapids
office

ROBERT (CONTD)

NANCY
Oh Sweetie There have been a
lot of changes in our lives since
youve been gone Your dad and I
losing you was very hard on us
And he and I

ROBERT
We had to go our different ways It
was what we had to do

Jack doesnt understand any of this but hates the tension
MA
Whoa This is not what I thought
was happening
NANCY
Your father felt we had to accept
that you were
She stops herself Robert suppresses his anger
ROBERT

People deal with things in their
own way

They sit

NANCY
I knew you’d come home one day

Wow

48 48

NANCY
Im so sorry I didnt know how to
tell you They said we should talk
to you together

Nancy is upset

ROBERT
The Doctor mentioned this other
place where they could help you
because it’s hard you know to
suddenly -

MA
(interrupting)
He has no idea what we’ve been
through Nothing could compare to
that

Robert and Nancy sit with this
MA (CONTD)
I told him we’re going home
(to Nancy)
Unless youd prefer us

NANCY
Of course not 48
Again a look passes between Robert and Nancy

MA

Nancy tries to calm her

NANCY

MA

Ma pulls Jack to his feet Jack risks a look at his
grandparents Robert looks down cant look Jack in the eye
Ma notices Jack has taken his shoes off She starts to fuss
with them then gives up and lifts Jack into her arms to
bring him inside

Ma Jack (masked with sunglasses on) Nancy and Robert move
towards the doors of the hospital where the Resident FBI
agent waits for them Robert is carrying the small bag that

contains all of Ma and Jack’s possessions

EXT CLINIC - DRIVEWAY - DAY 54

POLICE and HOSPITAL SECURITY are outside along with FBI

As Jack again takes in the scale of the outside world the
adults get caught in the logistics of who goes in which car
who will take Ma’s bag what will happen at the other end of
the journey Jack observes the little clusters of people with
their overlapping voices raised in clarification
reassurance

Ma and Jack are led to one of the waiting cars Jack bumps
his head getting in

We watch the convoy pulling away from the hospital and out
into the world

INT FBI CAR - DAY 55

A little later Driving through a better neater
neighborhood than Old Nicks

Jack grips Mas hand watches the world pass

JACK (VO)
Ive been in the world nineteen
hours Ive seen pancakes and
stairs and a cat and windows and
hundreds of cars and birds and
police and doctors and Grandma and
Grandpa and persons with different
faces and bigness and smells

worlds like all TV planets on at
the same time so I dont know which
what to look and listen Doors and
doors and behind all the door

outside and things happen-happen-
happening it never stops
Plus the worlds always changing
brightness and hotness and theres
invisible germs floating
everywhere When I was small I only
knew small things but now Im five
I know everything

She takes his mask off over his head

INT FBI CAR - LATER 56

They turn onto a residential street of low houses and well-
groomed lawns

Its all familiar to Ma yet utterly strange a crowd of media
(national and international) is set up across the road from
her house behind temporary barricades There are neighbors
and well-wishers carrying helium balloons flowers toys and
signs POLICE keep order

MA
(under her breath)
Jesus
Ma tidies her hair
Nancy Robert and a LAWYER emerge from the first car Nancy
Manages an apologetic smile and half-wave to the neighbors
who are watching from their own yards

RESIDENT AGENT leans in the drivers window to address Ma

Ma adjusts her shades and undoes her belt and Jacks

MA
(to Jack)

on the sofa Jack looks at cards and flowers arranged on a

MA
They’re from people saying they’re
happy that we’re safe and back
home

JACK

MA

Ma like Jack speaks quietly It’s as if they were ina
doctor’s waiting room or a stranger’s house trying to make a
good impression All so unreal

Ma gets up and looks out the window into the back yard Jack
follows

JACK
Wheres ice cream in the hammock

MA
(calling out)
Mom what have you done with the
hammock

NANCY
(from the kitchen)
I guess it must be in the basement

Just in case

The hospital said to avoid pets

and theres so much to take in

LEO
I told him he was a health hazard
Gotta sling your hook buddy He

Silence No one has any idea what to do next We hear the
front door open and close Robert appears he looks shaken
having taken questions from reporters He looks for a seat
chooses one far from Jack

NANCY

He rubs his face nods

ROBERT
Lawyer says they are expecting a
plea but can’t rule out a trial He

Ma and Jack move towards the stairs Ma carries a small bag
with their belongings Nancy follows At the foot of the
stairs Jack stops He’s never had to climb stairs before Ma
shows him how to grip the rail and he starts up

INT NANCY AND LEOS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Reaching the top of the stairs they walk the quiet carpeted
hallway Jack takes it all in

INT NANCY AND LEO’S HOUSE - MAS OLD ROOM - DAY 59

Ma and Jack enter Mas room They absorb the decor of Mas
adolescence - preserved by her mother

NANCY
This is your Moms room Jack

Jack looks around He pulls a strand of his long hair out of
his eyes

NANCY (CONTD)
Hey maybe tomorrow we can cut that
hair What do you say Jack

Jack shakes his head Whispers to Ma

MA
Jack says that’s where his ‘strong’
is

NANCY
Ah ha

59

Jack walks over to the bed and sits down We are with him as
he takes in the band posters track trophies pictures -
including pictures of his Mom as a young happy girl In the
background Nancy and Ma watch him

NANCY (CONTD)
Ill let you rest Well be
downstairs

Before she leaves Nancy talks quietly insistently to Ma we
only catch fragments of what shes saying 59

Conventional things promising she is there that theres
nothing Ma cant say to her how much she loves her Ma is
quiet a little shell-shocked Nancy leaves

Struck by the sight of her music keyboard Ma tries it dead
She kneels down finds the plug and puts it in the outlet

MA
You didnt know I could play piano
Guess this tune

But after a few notes of Home on the Range’Big Rock Candy
Mountain’ she stumbles Tries again and messes it up
Stretches her stiff hand Then she sits on the bed suddenly
limp Checks her watch It’s gone an old habit Both Ma and
Jack are subdued

JACK
How long do we have to stay here

She takes out her bag of meds

MA
(getting the tablets she
needs )
We live here now

She swallows her antibiotics and painkillers without water
She lies down We stay on Jacks face as he continues to take
in his surroundings and digest what Ma has said After a
little while he lies beside her and lifts her shirt so he can
snuggle up and breastfeed

We repeat a sequence of shots from life before their escape
ending in a mother and child portrait In the little bedroom
they could be in Room

INT NANCY AND LEO’S HOUSE - KITCHEN DINING ROOM - NIGHT 60

Ma with Jack pressed close to her sits at the dining table
with Nancy Robert and Leo Desert Jack is eating his first
bowl of ice-cream He takes a big mouthful and holds his hand
to his head He tugs at Ma and she leans down so he can
whisper to her

JACK
(whispering to Ma)
Ice cream hurts

LEO
You got a brain freeze there Jack

60

MA
Eat it slower

Small talk as food is passed around Ma puts her fork down
she is beginning to get upset Nancy watches her puts a hand
on hers After a little while Ma calms

They eat quietly the adults aware of the complexity and
strangeness of the situation Jack oblivious chomps away at
his ice-cream Robert watches him

ROBERT
Im going to turn in

Beat
MA
Is there something wrong
ROBERT
No
MA

Why are you in such a hurry

ROBERT
It’s been a long day

MA
You havent said one word to Jack

Unlike Ma Nancy hasn’t put two and two together about

Robert’s awkward bearing around Jack

NANCY
Joy

Robert looks haunted torn
ROBERT

We don’t have to talk about this
now

From the carefulness and awkwardness of Robert’s reply Nancy

begins to understand

NANCY
My God
MA
(to Robert)

Yes we do Look at him
Robert can’t Ma’s anger deserts her

MA (CONTD)

I’m so sorry I shouldn’t be here

INT MA’S OLD BEDROOM - LATE AT NIGHT 61
Jack lies awake beside his sleeping mom

He hears footsteps The door cracks open and a convoluted
shadow appears rimmed in light The door opens wider and the
shadow resolves into Robert watching his daughter and
grandson sleep Jack burrows into his pillow pretending to
sleep The door closes and soon he sleeps

62A

INT NANCY AND LEO’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM —- MORNING 62

Through a chink in net curtains of a car pulling up outside

Nancy and Leo’s house The Lawyer gets out We see that the

MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC with nothing better to do a UNIFORMED
POLICE OFFICER and a POLICE CAR

NANCY (0OC)

We are in the lounge Jack turns away from the window as
Nancy goes to greet the Lawyer keeping herself hidden as she
opens the door

NANCY (CONT’D)

INT DINING ROOM - LATER

The LAWYER and Nancy watch Ma filling out some forms She is
subdued Jack has some blank paper in front of him He is
staring at a large open box of Crayola pencils every shade
of every color He carefully selects 5 pencils - the 5 colors
he’s used to from Room - and begins to draw

Jack occasionally glances at Leo drawn by his

warmth

LAWYER
The other thing we need to talk
about is coming up with some kind
of media strategy I know youre
not thinking about that right now
But there’s a lot to decide about
in that category

NANCY
I don’t think we’re ready for
talking yet Not like that

natural

LAWYER
There are certain to be expenses
going forward and a prime time

interview means a lot of money
Donations are coming - and I’ll
need some account details better
in yours than mine right - but it
wouldn’t amount to enough for you

Beat

LAWYER (CONTD)
There’s huge interest

Ma notices that Jack is using only the same small set of
colors for his drawing that he had in Room

MA
Jack you have all those colors

slayer with every color

Jack keeps drawing

LIASON OFFICER He shows them to the door

LEO
Thank you again

65

He lets them out closes the door behind them then peeps
through the closed curtains As he turns away he spots Jack
gives him a salute and then busies himself in ways calculated
to raise the interest of a 5-year-old Tidying up he picks
up a ball from the floor spins it on his finger bounces it
Wanders off out of view whistling muttering about how
particularly bouncy this ball is etc

Jack starts down the stairs He goes down on his backside not
yet confident enough to do it standing
INT LIVING ROOMKITCHEN - MORNING 66
Jack wanders cautiously into the brightness of the living
room finding Leo who smiles at him then gets back to
whatever he’s pretending to be doing
Jack is silent
LEO
(to himself)
Gee am I hungry

He pads into the kitchen

LEO (CONT’D)
Let’s see what we have here

stocked cupboard he opens the fridge for milk Jack takes in
all the produce it contains

is a new cosmos He wanders tentatively into the open space
Jack kneels to investigate the dirt and grass He smells
deeply

was pregnant with Jack it just
seemed like a terrible joke You

place it just seemed so wrong I
was in a very scary frame of mind

Did it ever occur to you to ask

your captor to take Jack away

Away 101
