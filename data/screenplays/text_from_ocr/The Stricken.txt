EXT DESERT LANDSCAPE - DAY

THE SUN Massive Relentless So intense it buzzes It hangs
in the sky burning blinding constant And then a faint
SCREECH Animal Human It echoes from far away

Off towering mesas heat radiating off the rock
Through shallow canyons casting black shadows

The echoes die on the stillness of the bleached almost
martian landscape In the sand reaching towards the
horizon there is dark metal TRAIN TRACKS

EXT TRAIN STATION - DAY

TITLE CARD 1887

Dusty and wooden A blonde GIRL 6 stands beside her MOTHER
holding a doll She looks down the tracks eager

And distant where the tracks nearly vanish a black dot
The girl gasps Waiting TRAVELERS pick up their bags

A black train chugs closer Getting louder It’s coming fast
The MANAGER checks his pocket watch Murmurs of confusion

And the train roars by blowing wind across the platform The
girl flinches at the noise and looks up

THE TRAIN Windows are smashed cracked with bullet holes

The girl looks at her mother confused The train passes and
becomes a dot again The girl leans to watch it

Angry eyes fall on the station manager Complaints

The train chugs on wheels screeching white sun flashing off
its black windows again and again

significant little town Cody

CODY

ETHAN

‘em all the hell up to be more
romantic But they don’t matter

Cody takes that in his steps slowing down
CODY
Well all right but they could
still matter some right

Ethan stops his horse and looks down at a squinting Cody
CODY (CONTD)
On account of folks not havin’
much Stories I mean

Ethan catches an ELDERLY MAN eyeing him as he passes by with
his DAUGHTER The man pulls his daughter back making sure he
stands between Ethan and her They move past in a hurry

ETHAN
Lazar’s an old-timer You’re asking
the wrong man

CODY
Who should I ask then

CODY (CONTD)
“named for his vicious
preference for beating his victims
to death with his cast iron fist”
Now there-- there you see Sheriff
That hand didn’t look like no cast
iron to me Looked like brass

The slightest smile curves under Banks’ mustache

Behind Cody Ethan stares out the window He shakes his head
SHERIFF BANKS
Better go out there then-- keepin’
your distance of course and see if
that sharp eye of yours can get to
the bottom of it

CODY
Honest Sheriff

SHERIFF BANKS
Leave nothin’ to speculation As

Grace keeps the chores in stride moving back to the table
but pausing before her husband looking him in the eye

GRACE (CONT’D)
We want a family someday How can
we reject the family we have now

Ethan shakes his head as she moves away

GRACE (CONT’D)
C’mon Ethan I’ve heard the
campfire stories So what

ETHAN
Those stories are why we have to
live like goddamn lepers

He collapses in a rocking chair and sighs

Grace turns facing her husband Stalemate The table lantern
flickers She wrings her towel voice quieter

GRACE
We could pull up stakes Maybe

ETHAN
I ain’t lettin’ these stupid hicks
chase us outta here

Graces eyes fall shut She turns away disappointed
ETHAN (CONT’D)

We’re just so goddamn far from

Knocking at the door Frantic Ethan and Grace both startle

Jaw firm Ethan looks back at the map And is stumped

EXT DESERT TRAIN TRACK - DAY

THE TRAIN Black Silent Still The sun beats down on it
Banks Ethan Silva and the bounty hunters take the train
in a cautious distance from the tracks A hawk’s screech
echoes Ethan looks

There’s nothing in the windows Only dark

ETHAN
Could have all abandoned maybe

Banks is locked on the train Uneasy His horse jitters

TIP TOP
Hello in there

BLAM Jennings fires into the air They all startle Banks
throws a hard look at Tip Top as the shot echoes

Smirking Tip Top shrugs Worth a try

They dismount and head to different parts of the train Ethan
heads to the back trading a look with Banks

SHERIFF BANKS
Got it

Not very convincingly Ethan nods Banks goes with Silva
Ethan looks up at the back car BULLET HOLES are shot through
a window Ethan takes out his revolver and moves forward
INT TRAIN REFRESHMENT CAR - CONTINUOUS

GLASSES Still filled with booze Beyond them Ethan comes to
the ajar door casting a shadow in the harsh sunlight He

pauses wincing a stench hitting him in the face He looks

There’s no one in the car The counter the tables the
seats Everything a mess left vacant in a hurry

Pressing a handkerchief to his face Ethan takes a creaking
step forward DING He startles looking down

He’s kicked a SERVICE BELL knocked to the floor It seems to
resonate forever

Chest heaving Ethan scans again Plates overturned Windows
shattered An open book’s pages flap with the wind

The bell dies and Ethan backs out of there not seeing
one GLASS with a cloud of BLOOD suspended in the alcohol

EXT TRAIN CONNECTING PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS

Ethan backs out and turns to the car behind him The door is
shut its window covered in dust

Eyes narrowing Ethan gets closer
He leans in trying to spy inside the car

ETHAN POV Through some of the dust you can see seats and
PEOPLE still in them What the hell

Breathing faster he wipes the window with his handkerchief
ETHAN POV The dust is wiped away revealing a HORRIBLE
FACE just on the other side of the glass Yellow skin hollow

sockets mouth gaping

Ethan cries out jumping back catching himself on the
platform railing

WINDOW The person is dead a woman her face petrified and
pressed against the door face decayed and eaten away

Ethan catches his breath eyes fixed on the face

INT TRAIN LAST PASSENGER CAR - CONTINUOUS

From the outside Ethan pushes against the door and the body
pressed against it falls away Wiping more he peers in

All the PASSENGERS are rotting skeletons Melted eye sockets
Bloody spindles for hands Thrown over one another clawing
to escape Corroded faces frozen in silent screams

Ethan can’t believe it He does a double take

He sees Banks entering the opposite end of the car
handkerchief to his face shocked and revolted

Movement Lying in the aisle is the TICKET MASTER’s body
and it begins to LIFT ITSELF UP on shaking knobby arms

Its eyes swivel up at Banks its grotesque mouth opening
ARRRRRRRRRGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

The ticket master is up His intestines spill with his first
step swinging out in front of him Banks backs up

ETHAN
Get out Get outta there Langston

Ethan pushes the door but it’s blocked by fallen bodies

The ticket master’s lipless jaw falls open roar gurgling
arms stretched towards Banks The sheriff’s gun comes out

Bang Bang The shots pass through the ticket master rocking
his gait but he still staggers towards Banks cornering him

Ethan gets through the door revolver drawn BANG

The back of the ticket master’s skull explodes The corpse
falls forward his husk of a hand SCRATCHING BANKS’ FOREARM
Banks jumps back The corpse lays still leaking foulness

Banks and Ethan share a surprised look Banks’ face tenses

He looks at his scratched arm

EXT DESERT TRAIN TRACK - DAY

Amid Banks’ screams Ethan and Silva pull the sheriff out of
the train and lie him down The bounty hunters approach

TIP TOP
The fuck’s going on

Ethan watches as Banks’ arm ROTS BEFORE HIS EYES Revealing
muscle and bone SIZZLING

TIP TOP (CONTD)
Holy Christ look at that

ETHAN
Get back It’s catchin’

Ethan looks and spots a hunting knife on Tip Top’s boot He
reaches and yanks it free

ETHAN (CONTD)
Hold him down Help me hold him

Dumbstruck they all do Ethan puts the large blade to the
crook of Banks’ elbow And grits his teeth

Ethan leans forward to say something Words fail him
She storms out stepping hard Ethan sits back at a loss
SHERIFF BANKS
They-- they’1ll remember the rotten
deeds but need good ones

Ethan leans in urgent Banks’ points with his only hand

Ethan makes a confused sound Houston removes the depressor

HOUSTON (CONTD)
Back east it has inspired many a
missionary to take pity on orphaned
savages of the “Wild West” Even
put a few of them through school

Eyes on the floor Ethan nods getting it

ETHAN
I reckon you have to tell that tale
a lot

HOUSTON

Only to dispel others Deep breath

FADE TO BLACK

EXT GRAND CANYON - NIGHT

With no sun its majesty becomes heavy gloom The stillness
is cut with the distant sound of COUGHING Weak it echoes
off towering walls through the gaping abyss

SPRAK A match is struck and lights a lantern revealing the
grizzled face of MCGREEVES 40s Short black beard Red
handkerchief around his neck Head tilted he tries to hear

MCGREEVES
HARPER

His call echoes Lantern over his head McGreeves steers his
horse on the craggy shore of the slow murmuring river

MCGREEVES (CONTD)
Harper Where are ya Ya getting’
on all right HARPER

The coughing stops McGreeves pauses his horse A voice
sounds Hoarse Hissing Slithering from all directions

MAD CROW HARPER (0S)
Just famously

The horse startles Still not locating the echo’s source
McGreeves urges the animal forward

MCGREEVES
Boys are camped out just a stone’s
throw Thought I’d check in on ya--

MAD CROW HARPER (0S)
No no no No one rests They

McGreeves scoffs

MCGREEVES
Tonight Why What are we doing

MAD CROW HARPER (0S)
Gambling

McGreeves looks up the light not quite reaching tall pillars
of rock hunching down at him like gargoyles

WHOOSH A BLACK HORSE Harper’s horse explodes from the
dark almost crashing into McGreeves It dashes away and
snuffs McGreeves lantern He curses and feels his pockets

MCGREEVES
Well I don’t know now Boys are
pretty spooked Those goddamn cars--

The coughing explodes again closer McGreeves looks up but
it’s just too goddamn dark He fumbles for his matches

McGreeves and his horse descend from some rocks into rustling
brush the coughing even louder It’s wet and resonant

MCGREEVES (CONT’D)
Hey-- Harper Where are you C’mon

And there’s gagging By the water McGreeves hears splashes

He hops off his growling horse and heads to the river He
tries another match SCRATCH SCRATCH

MCGREEVES (CONTD)
‘Cause you ain’t soundin’ so good--

SPRAK McGreeves lifts the lantern and startles

There’s a man catching his breath hands and knees in the
river SURROUNDED BY BUZZARDS DOZENS OF THEM Huge black
they squawk and flap in the light THEY WAIT

The man turns to McGreeves Under the dripping tendrils of
his hair there are no eyes but circles of opaque goggles
This is ADRIAN “MAD CROW” HARPER 30s And his veins are
starting to show JUST LIKE THE CHILD Still he smiles

MAD CROW HARPER
Never better

McGreeves can only stare His horse rears and wails

Ethan looks over to the bounty hunters They drink and smoke

TIP TOP
Hmm Uh no not exactly Harper’s

much Other outlaws though that’s
always been uh what’s the word
“Tempra-dental”

Ethan starts to correct him but thinks better of it

Glaring back she bites her cigarette holder and lights up

CODY

off under that stately cape of his
You know so he can draw with no

Molly looks away and exhales a stream of smoke

Ethan goes for her shoulder pack He pulls out a pad and
pencil and offers them to Molly She looks up at him

ETHAN
Let’s have a look at him

She stares up at him stung

Ethan waits

Molly grinds her cigarette out and storms away from camp

ETHAN (CONT’D)

IN THE BRUSH Ethan catches up with her and spins her around
Her eyes shimmer

Houston keeps looking up fear in his face

THE RIDGE The Navajo watch Placid against the sky

Houston looks down Ethan offers the telescope The doctor
opens his mouth but words fail him He doesn’t touch it

Ethan’s confused A noise The child coughs and whimpers

The company slows to a stop Ethan and Cody wait while
Houston and Molly exit the wagon They look worried

HOUSTON
The boy’s fever is worsening

ETHAN
Aint that a damn shock

HOUSTON
If we’re near the Colorado we
should take the opportunity to
replenish our water rations

ETHAN
You know where we are The river

exactly common in the desert

draped over half his body walks head down arms limp
through ankle-deep water Harper There’s sway in his gait
CHARVEL

a bit of an odd stick since AandP

McGreeves trots over and snatches a large BLACK SACK from
Charvel The contents sparkle THE TRAIN LOOT

MCGREEVES

Charvel doesn’t hear it staring with others at the river

INTERCUT WITH EXT COLORADO RIVER RIDGE - CONTINUOUS

sand and stone where THE RIVER begins to cleave the desert

Pausing Ethan and the bounty hunters look down

ETHAN (CONT’D)

But they bump into one another More shots

A horse is hit in the rump It rears up yanking the reins
tipping back the wagon Molly wraps the reins around her arm

Houston falls out the back and hits the sand hard
IN THE WAGON The child gasps rocked around inside

The horses go wild and break their holdings They push the
wheels closer to THE EDGE of the ridge

ETHAN (CONT’D)

Molly strains at the reins One horse snaps its tugs bucking
and thrashing away from the wagon

The wheels tilt CLOSER
BANG Blood sprays as the other horse is hit in the head
It falls off the lip of the ridge PULLING THE WAGON WITH IT

Ethan and the bounty hunters pull their horses out of the way
as momentum takes the wagon OVER THE EDGE

Distant the wagon rolls toward them kicking up dust
Harper watches and hums curious

ETHAN (CONT’D)
Hold on

the bounty hunters follow

THE WAGON Molly tumbles inside and reaches for the terrified
boy but they’re jostled around too hard They cry out

In the wake of dust Ethan and the bounty hunters are in
white-knuckled pursuit horses sprinting down the incline

Below more smoke plumes Bullets zip by them as they nearly
plummet The lead tears wood and canvas away from the wagon

Tip Top and the Amigo fire back They aim through the wagon

ETHAN (CONTD)
What are you doing

Tip Top veers his horse right against Ethans
TIP TOP
Sorry Sheriff There’s money in
bringin’ in criminal bastards
but not their sons

fall and slide to the sand and rock out of the chase

Tip Top laughs Jennings whoops

A wagon wheel breaks up Molly and the boy are thrown about

IN THE WAGON WATER ROARS and slams into Molly and the child

Harper tilts on his horse and looks for anyone in the
wreckage Gun shots Charvel’s horse goes wild

The bounty hunters charge in guns blazing The posse swarms
and it’s a melee Hooves pound smoke billows

McGreeves throws one end of his lasso to Sampson TWANG The
Amigo and Jennings get clothes-lined They hit the ground

Tip Top rides low keyed up aiming for the black cape
Mad Crow trots calmly along He combs his hair uninvolved
Tip Top sweats steadying his aim But a SHADOW falls on him

It’s Sledge Turner A giant swing of his HAMMER crushes into
Tip Top’s horse The force brings the animal up and down

The bounty hunter falls and scrambles but McGreeves’ lasso
catches his neck He’s yanked choking Caught

The chaos ends the posse trots to a stop Seething Tip Top
looks On his horse Mad Crow looks down at him

MAD CROW HARPER
Mr Tip Top I presume I wondered
what happened to Mr Hastings

One hand on the lasso Tip Top can’t speak

MAD CROW HARPER (CONT’D)
Who’s gonna wonder what happened to
you

BANG Sampson winces as a rip flutters his long coat He
cries out the posse becoming alert and look out More shots

Up the slope Ethan ducks behind a rock revolver smoking
The posse fires back Harper shades his goggles to look
Ethan peeks out safe The high ground

Harper whistles The posse takes off the bounty hunters
dragged along with them Shots echo And they’re gone

Ethan walks down to the bank dusty and pissed Only a few
dead bandits and a stray horse left He looks to the river

Molly and the child wade away from the wagon wreckage She
locks eyes with her brother stunned

The child takes her hand Surprised she holds it

Ethan looks along the river bank a cloud of dust the only

More laughing as two barely clothed PROSTITUTES appear A
brunette lies beside him finger grazing his chest and a
redhead straddles his stomach They’re all smiles

REDHEAD PROSTITUTE (CONT’D)
It’s high time we girls got paid

Irregular eyes narrow at her beneath the jagged metal His
hand comes up and grabs the redhead’s hair She gasps

ETHAN
Shut up Don’t move Ladies

The women put their hands up Rope in hand Houston moves
towards them

Leadface scoffs and sits in a rocking chair

Ethan goes in to search the jacket hanging on the back of
Leadface’s chair Cody is awe-struck Leadface notices

LEADFACE

Ethan looks back at Cody who doesn’t have his gun raised

ETHAN

Leadface reaches for his jacket and produces a pistol Ethan
spins and connects the butt of his gun to the mask just in
time Metal meets metal

BONG Leadface crumples to the floor The brunette gasps
They all breathe heavy Leadface is out cold Close call
Ethan turns to the shocked Cody and pins him to the wall

ETHAN

She rushes to the window and looks across the Goldstove
stretch to the saloon More noise Gunfire

INT GOLDSTOVE SALOON - NIGHT

Prostitutes’ shrill screams are drowned by gunshots as the
saloon fills with smoke blood and cries Pure mayhem

Ethan pushes the poker table on its side for cover
Leadface charges and fires into the table

Harper tips back in his chair and shoots Leadface down and
casts an interested eye on Ethan

Saxon Lazar claws at himself and rips off his own blistering
face infected After a wounded howl from his bloody mouth
he thrashes taking out two bandits Wild rabid

Houston pulls Cody down to the floor and searches

The BLACK SACK Spilled to the floor Twenty feet off
Houston crawls towards it leaving Cody plugging his ears
Fuming the Hun yanks the darts from the dartboard above his

head and lunges at Harper plunging the fist full of metal
into Harper’s shoulder Harper is bent over

McGreeves aims pulls and blows a hole in the Hun’s throat

Wincing Harper pulls the darts from his shoulder the tips
DRIPPING WITH BLOOD And his wince arcs into a smile

Crouched not far from Harper’s feet Ethan sees this

ETHAN
No

Ethan lunges but is intercepted by someone else and driven
hard into THE BAR Ethan looks to see the snarling eye-
patched face of Sampson He gets his hands on Ethan’s throat
SAMPSON
Let me guess You’re the one who
shot me aren’t ya

Ethan writhes and gasps for air Sampson grips tighter

SAMPSON (CONT’D)
I got an eye for these things

Ethan crashes a bottle in Sampson’s face sending the bandit
backwards soaked Ethan gets back on his feet

IN THE CROWD Harper throws sticking men with the darts

The third lands in the jugular of one gun-toter He winces
holds his neck and opens bleeding animal eyes RAAAA

More stricken begin to thrash and scream as the germ spreads
in the crowd Blood splashes smoke billows

Houston crawls and grabs the black sack just as WHAM a
SLEDGEHAMMER caves in the floor where it rested

Houston looks up to see Sledge Turner leaning into his
hammer teeth gritted With a growl he backhands the doctor
sending him flying and pries the hammer from the floor

THE BAR Reeling back Sampson draws as Ethan does Both
fire frantic In twin plumes of smoke they both miss

Sampson fires more Ethan dodges and dives behind the bar
All smiles Sampson slides a LONG BAYONET from his belt

Sledge looms over him and brings his hammer high BANG A
chair breaks over his back He doesn’t flinch but turns

A sheepish Cody stands splintered chair in his hands Sledge
steps once and prods Cody down with the hammer’s handle

Sledge turns back to Houston just in time to see the doctor
dive through a window black sack in hand Glass crashes

criminal flies backwards face squirting blood

Sampson falls into a cluster of stricken bandits Ethan
watches as they claw and bite tearing Sampson apart Sampson
screams BLOOD ERUPTS from his body AAAHHHHH

On the bar Ethan tears off the mask and gasps for air He
grabs a lantern at the end of the bar and hurls it

It shatters on Sampson’s liquor-soaked body He and the
infected bandits go up in FLAMES

The fire spreads body to body Ethan watches the whole saloon
in horror A flaming stricken bandit crashes to his feet

It reaches for Ethan and shrieks “help” Its jaw falls off
Blam Ethan shoots it back He scans panicked

Harper climbs over a railing toward a broken window He
throws his cape and looks back pistol out

Saxon Lazar turns to Harper his face skeletal eyes melting
His rotting larynx vibrates with a hateful bellow BLAM
Harper fires and blows Lazar in half

Satisfied Harper waves away the smoke from his barrel and
escapes

Ethan leaps after him table to table dodging thrashing
hands and kicking over more lanterns Fire roars

The chaos wanes and the saloon goes up in smoke and flame

framework a maze of fresh pale lumber Houston and Molly

smashes a support Houston throws the sack to Molly

Molly catches the bad and sidesteps ready for Sledge’s
approach

Behind Sledge Molly throws her hip and pulls a seam of
buttons down the length of her riding skirt revealing her
stockinged leg all the way up her BARE HIP

Sledge pauses to ogle her

Even Houston cocks an eyebrow

Her hand shoots up from her stocking A flash of moonlight
catches metal in MID AIR

Thunk A KNIFE plunges into Sledge’s neck Blood squirts

Yelling Sledge steps forward and grips Molly’s throat He
lifts her into the air a sneer on his face Her feet kick

Molly’s eyes bulge She gasps for air face darkening

Houston bounds up and grabs the hammer He takes out a
vertical support Crash Toppling wood descends on them all

Sledge looks up just in time to see a wooden beam drive into
his face bending him backwards He’s pinned him to the
ground CRUNCH

Ethan kicks open the old door lantern up gun pointed

It’s pitch black As he shifts the lantern light gleams back
on dozens of different surfaces The sunken shack is storage
for racks and racks of BOTTLES all forming narrow aisles

Ethan searches It’s dead silent

ETHAN
I know you’re here you spineless
son of a bitch Show yourself

Ethan takes the rickety steps down the floor He moves slow
and keeps the light up

his way to it Silent steps

throwing light on the aisle

Harper’s not there either

A small zipping sound Ethan perks up What is that

MAD CROW HARPER (0S)
Tell me something what exactly
does a sheriff even do around here
Have you seen the sights lately
This look like a nation of laws to

He lowers the lantern to a trail of BLOOD in the dirt

just solved a riddle for me

MAD CROW HARPER (0S)
Point is Mr Sheriff there ain’t
no law here Folks can’t stomach

wheezing and coughing Breathless he’s still amused

sister Ima kill you you bastard

Angry faces stretched and horrible They reach for Ethan
pull at his horse He tries his gun in the air Empty

ETHAN
No get back

His horse rears back Harper’s body FALLS TO THE SAND

Ethan pulls away from gnashing faces but there are too many
He looks back to Molly and Houston They’re trapped

In the distance McGreeves smirks

Ethan yanks at a pitchfork and prods a woman back A rock
hits him in the face He spits blood pulls his horse back

ETHAN (CONT’D)
Get back you goddamn animals

A broom breaks over his back SNAP Ethan arcs in pain

MOLLY

The boy starts to cry Ethan makes a desperate swing with the
butt of his gun his horse going wild Blood in his face

ETHAN
Animals--

Smash A bottle hits Ethan’s face He crashes to the ground
Feet stomp all around him Triumphant yells The boy cries
Molly calls out

Face bleeding Ethan manages to turn over

Red roaring FACES fire in their EYES Hands twisted in
rage all reaching for Ethan He can’t fight them off He’s
struck in the face Sound echoes away

CUT TO BLACK

FADE IN

INT RANCH HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Ethan gasps eyes bolting open His face is marred with
bruises and cuts but he’s cleaned up tended to He winces
and looks around Gentle sun pours in through a window

He’s in a bedroom Simple handsomely furnished There’s a
framed etching of a train on the wall At a desk there are
train diagrams maps a magnifying glass

Ethan’s hat gun star and fresh clothes rest neat on a
cushioned bench He swallows Where the hell is he

Suddenly there are screams A child’s Agony Ethan leaps up
and grabs his gun He limps to the door and kicks it open
INT RANCH HOUSE DEN - CONTINUOUS

SLAM Ethan points his gun

In an open den an old man is on all fours on a bearskin rug
surgical mask and gloves on tickling the child They stop
and turn to Ethan

The old man pulls down the mask revealing his earthy face
with deep lines blue eyes wide This is THOMAS LITTLE 60s
Ethan and Molly’s father man of vile myth and legend

THOMAS
Son You’re up

Ethan’s mouth hangs open and he lowers his gun

MONTAGE OF RANCH PROPERTY

IN THE SKY clouds begin to move in above the rolling ranch
grounds The distant rumble of thunder

ON THE PORCH the child sits quiet in corner mask on
Content gentle breeze blowing he draws until the sun
goes in He looks up

TELESCOPE POV Still at a great distance the Navajo remain
still on a hillside watching Thunder echoes Wind growls

IN A FIELD Houston pulls down THE TELESCOPE out of breath
He’s stunned shaking Unable to help himself he points the
telescope and looks at the Navajo again More wind

THE OIL RIG The walking beam rises and dips Workers yell

THOMAS (VO)
Guess they all did it up in
Pennsylvania to some great acclaim
Big money Big stories

EXT RANCH HOUSE PORCH - DAY

Wrapped in a blanket mug of coffee in hand Ethan watches
the rig half a mile off beneath a gray overcast sky

Behind him Thomas Little sits in a rocking chair with a mug
of his own He eyes his son hesitant

THOMAS
You and ya misses been gettin’ my
letters at all Gracie was it

ETHAN
She gets them I don’t read them

THOMAS
Well y’all are welcome to hole
up here while you--

ETHAN
We ain’t stayin’ long

THOMAS
Are you sure You got worked over
to all hell--

Ethan tosses his coffee out onto the lawn and plunks his mug
down hard on the porch railing

Thomas chooses his words

THOMAS (CONTD)

I understand You bein’ on a
important mission an’ all
(beat)

Ya sister told me about y’all
riggin’ that game a’ five card
Jesus you got some balls on you
Ya shoulda mentioned my name they
probably would have let you deal

ETHAN
I mention your name and I wake up
looking like this

Ethan finally turns to his father steely eyes cutting
through the cuts and bruises

Thomas stays unruffled He nods sips his coffee
Ethan nods all of this familiar He starts to leave
THOMAS

Your sister I think she’s fixin’
to stay a while bless her heart

ETHAN
Then she can stay behind

THOMAS
She and that injun doc ya got with
ya say it might not be safe to move
that scoundrel y’all apprehended

That stops Ethan at the threshold and grips the door frame

INT QUARANTINE WAGON - DAY

Houston’s gloved hands press gray skin checking a pulse The
torso heaves wheezing It’s HARPER laid out unconscious

HOUSTON
He’s very ill Carrying it like
the boy but worse

Masked and gloved Molly sits with the lantern stunned eyes
on the body Rain patters on the canvas over her

HOUSTON (CONTD)
I don’t know if it’s because he’s
older or what But he’s
deteriorating much faster

MOLLY
He’s dying

Houston looks at her hearing the quiver in her soft voice
She keeps her eyes on Harper numb Lightning CRACK
HOUSTON
He’s stable now But I’m not even

sure if he’ll become conscious aga--

Overwhelmed Molly exits the wagon

EXT RANCH GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

Houston follows but Molly has already stopped looking out
Beyond a fire where the child stands the dark figure of
Ethan storms toward them The child looks up from something

he’s holding and watches Ethan pass by

Not breaking his stride Ethan snatches a GOLD POCKET WATCH
from the boy’s hands

And tosses it into the fire where the BLACK SACK burns

MOLLY
Ethan

He charges past them and opens the flap on the back of the
wagon He looks in Harper still lies inside Ethan freezes

MOLLY (CONTD)

I was able to grab my rifle back
after you were coldcocked We got
him back--

Ethan reaches into the wagon and grabs Harper’s ankles He
pulls the body out Lifeless it slaps down into the mud

MOLLY HOUSTON
What are you doing Sheriff

ETHAN
What we set out to do

Ethan backs away and draws his revolver
HOUSTON
Sheriff the man’s unarmed He’s
not even conscious
Ethan ignores him and prepares to load the weapon
MOLLY
You said you were going to hang

him In front of the town

ETHAN
The town Like Goldstove

Ethan scoffs and looks up at her eyes cold Thunder rolls

ETHAN (CONTD)
What the hell’s the difference

CLACK Reloaded Ethan spins the cylinder Ready to aim
Ethan looks up Houston stands in the way

HOUSTON
This man is sick with the germ

ETHAN
Then he belongs on the fire With
the rest of the filth

HOUSTON
We don’t know anything about it

ETHAN
You don’t know nothin’ about it
You ain’t helped it Ain’t cured
it When are you gonna get off your
ass After the boy’s already in the
ground

HOUSTON
I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO

Ethan and Molly are taken aback by the outburst

Not comprehending the boy looks back and forth between the
adults Arm up he shields himself from the rain

HOUSTON (CONTD)
In a proper facility I could treat
it I could consult Give a
prognosis But we’re in this
godforsaken desert

Houston catches his breath at a loss Rain soaks them all
HOUSTON (CONT’D)
Out here I don’t know what
anyone could do
ETHAN
(aiming)

All the more reason--

HOUSTON
No

Houston rushes Ethan and the men grapple Houston slips in
the mud and Ethan lands a pistol whip The Doctor falls

Molly charges her brother

MOLLY
You can’t--

Ethan grabs her face and pushes her to the mud

He aims at Harper Rain pelts the gun metal Hand steady

Harper lies rain hitting him He groans Stirs

Ethan cocks the hammer and spots the child

The boy using Ethan’s big hat to block the rain watches
They lock eyes But Ethan tears away and aims again
Harper moans It sounds like “Haaaaa”

Ethan curses and storms off leaving all of them stunned and
mud-splattered Thunder crashes again loud

DISSOLVE TO

INT QUARANTINE WAGON - NIGHT

Dark Coughing Harper sits hunched over in the dark
spitting struggling to breathe There is a light Someone
comes to the blanket draped over the back of the wagon
It’s Molly Lantern Gloves Mask And scared eyes

He looks at her His ragged voice gains breath again

MAD CROW HARPER
Where are we

She considers and climbs in sitting across from him

MOLLY
Nevada Here Hold still

She unscrews a canteen for him With her help he manages to
get some water down He looks up at her the goggles on

Molly gently takes the goggles off him The light reveals
eyes full of bright red burst capillaries She gasps

He waves it away hands tied with rope She becomes stern

MOLLY (CONT’D)
Tell me what happened

MAD CROW HARPER
What are you the law now

MOLLY

His head falls forward his sigh nearly a wheeze

MAD CROW HARPER
It was a train

dressed PASSENGERS jump In the center aisle is the mangy
FORTUNATE DAN Irish 30s Gun in the air
FORTUNATE DAN

All righty right ladies and gents

No real mystery here is it Let’s

do this and get on with our lives

shall we

THE BLACK SACK is passed around Frantic hands dump in
jewelry and cash

It reaches a YOUNG MOTHER who turns to her boy in the seat
next to her THE CHILD He keeps the POCKET WATCH

FORTUNATE DAN (CONT’D)
Are we hard of hearin’ then

Dan sticks the gun in the mother’s face But a gloved hand
brings the gun down Dan looks

It’s HARPER Healthy Dashing even

He kneels down to the mother’s seat eye level with the boy
Harper holds out his hand

The child looks at the watch and gives it to Harper
Harper smiles stands and musses the boy’s hair
The sack is passed on Dan watches it go

At the back of the car Harper throws a canvas off a stack of
crates One is chained marked with the MEDICAL INSIGNIA

FORTUNATE DAN (CONT’D)
Whatcha got back there Harper

Harper tests the chain and cocks his head at it

MAD CROW HARPER
Just more presents to unwrap

He swings his cape off and points his sawed-off BOOM

The bird shot shreds into the wood and the blow back is WET
a white mist is sent into the air People wave it away

Condensation on his goggle lenses Harper spits It’s
everywhere Behind him the boy rubs his eyes blinking

Gags Coughs Screams Passengers jump up and hold their
faces backs arching

Dan pulls a woman down She reveals a MELTING FACE and wails

CHAOS breaks out More and more passengers writhe spasm and
rise from their seats Retching Bleeding Clawing

Harper fires misses and hits Dan The Irishman spits blood
and falls

The boy leaps down under the seat and covers his ears
terrified He looks up

His own mother shrieks and claws at him He crawls away

More and more horrible faces scream and hiss Bodies frantic
lunging over each other

Cornered Harper pulls both guns FLASH FLASH FLASH FLASH

RETURN TO QUARANTINE WAGON - NIGHT
Harper shrugs

MAD CROW HARPER
Just a train

She shakes her head and looks away trying to fathom
Harper’s wheezes are the only noise

MOLLY
Back in Texas you left me Like
I was nothing to you--

MAD CROW HARPER
Wasn’t like that-—-

MOLLY
Then what was it

He swallows eyes on the floor
MAD CROW HARPER
You know that I’ve always had to do
the one thing
MOLLY
Kill that man Blackie Smith For

killin’ your ma and pa I remember

Eyes still down Harper shakes his head

MAD CROW HARPER
I had always heard it was Smith
But stories can get crooked And
that night in Texas I finally
heard it straight
(beat)
And knew wed have to be apart

MOLLY
What do you mean

He can’t look at her

MOLLY (CONTD)
Adrian what does it have to do
with me

His eyes find her shoulder pack He reaches for her sketch
pad and as he pulls it out ENVELOPES fall to the floor
Harper bends and picks one up

THE ENVELOPE On the back is a pencil portrait of Harper
Molly scoffs embarrassed

MOLLY (CONT’D)
I used to test myself See if I
could still remember what you
looked like It’s foolish

He tries to laugh but coughs more

MAD CROW HARPER
Good to know that somewhere I’11
always look this good

Molly smiles her anger melting Her eyes well up

MOLLY
It’s not fair

She rubs his back as he evens out and brings him closer

MOLLY (CONTD)
When you left I wanted to just lay
down and die Now I get you back
just in time to lose you again

He looks up eyes human in the lantern light

MAD CROW HARPER
Everyone will remember me as one
thing Only you’1ll know different
You ain’t losin’ anything

Molly loses it and sobs She hesitates to touch him but
puts a gloved hand to his face and pulls him close

Their foreheads touch and come apart Frightened eyes stare
at each other Her hand comes up and slides down her mask

Molly shivers Faces get closer lips coming closer
Parted mouths yielding about to touch CLICK
Ethan has his head through the blanket pistol pointed
ETHAN
You’re gonna wanna back the hell
away from my sister Right now

blankets And laughs

front of the house They’re prepping to leave

Thomas with coffee watches over from the porch At his
feet the child sits on the step examining a toy train

THOMAS (CONTD)
You wanna at least get some coffee

Stone-faced Ethan doesn’t turn to the porch

THOMAS (CONTD)
-Well all right You rascals

She goes up to her father They smile and hug

Thomas stands up straighter

THOMAS
Is that any way to treat yer kin
Yer sister has a heart to forgive

ETHAN
Well she’s been known to keep
mixed company

Molly’s eyes narrow

THOMAS
You look at me boy You look at me
and tell me what you see that
confounds you so A warm bed when
you needed it Bandages Food

MOLLY
Daddy was the one who sat with you
all night Ethan--

Ethan steps to Thomas eyes ablaze

ETHAN
What I see I see a pathetic old
man tucked away on a pile of dirty
money while everyone far and wide
still trembles at the mention of

his name
THOMAS
Half of them stories with my name
in ‘em they ain’t even true
ETHAN

And half of them are
With no retort Thomas shakes his head

Sullen the child puts the train aside Familiar Ethan
storms over and picks him up

THOMAS
Every time every time I dropped
in on yer ma you always begged me--
“can I come wit’ ya pa Can I come
wit’ ya” And now--

ETHAN
And now I can’t take a goddamn step
without haulin’ you with me

Thomas is shaken

ETHAN (CONT’D)
The only reason I’m hangin’ this
bastard is so when I have my own
son he won’t ever have no reason
to be ashamed of his pa He’ll know
his father did the right thing

He puts the boy on the horse with Houston and places his hat
on the boy’s tiny head patting down the brim

THOMAS
I-I want you to see that people can
change that a man can That-- that
you can ask me one more time

Ethan finally turns to Thomas surprised by the tremble in
his father’s voice

Thomas takes a step forward

Ethan spins around eyes shimmering

ETHAN

Dejected Thomas shares another hug with Molly

Ethan looks into the quarantine wagon
HARPER IS GONE Severed ropes where he used to lie
Ethan spins around He looks at Molly

Molly reads him She touches her skirt Two buttons along her
thigh are undone Her look says it all Her KNIFE is gone

Ethan scans the dark horizon In the moonlight he can just
make out the oil rig and its WORKERS’ BARRACKS beside it

keyed up Once again he searches for Harper in the dark

Beyond a makeshift forum through a screen door three dozen
RIG WORKERS lie in rows of cots asleep Undisturbed

Ethan breathes easier relieved

He puts down the lantern and moves closer to make sure
Ethan pushes open the screen door and peers in getting a
closer look Behind him the wooden door slowly silently

closes behind him

Ethan turns around It’s too late Black fabric flaps
Darkness rushes over him

Houston stands and locks eyes unafraid

Molly almost laughs Tension is suddenly thick until

Molly and Houston share a panicked look

INTERCUT WITH EXT RIG WORKERS’ BARRACKS RANCH GROUNDS

The barracks’ door is jammed shut with a long shovel handle
Growls and screams Something presses against it hard
Again The handle cracks SLAM The door swings open

Molly Thomas and Houston rush to the window and look out
bathed in cold blue moonlight

In the distance on a gentle slope above the house they
watch tiny dark figures spill out of the barracks Fast

Stricken rig workers sprint towards the Little house
Spitting Hissing Teeth bared Backs arched back Desperate
ferocious AGONY RRRWWAAHHH It echoes

At the window they flinch

She reaches and pulls out a CIGARETTE It sits handsomely in
her ornate HOLDER Carved wood and ivory

Houston moans and pushes with all his might An arm reaches
grasping for his face The hand burns to its bones right
before the doctor’s eyes RAAAAAAAWWWWRRRRRR

Molly pulls the cigarette from the holder

A workers head pushes through It bites and thrashes
Another one A door hinge is pried from the wall

Hand trembling Molly reaches down to the boy’s bloody mess
of a throat and pushes the cigarette holder in Nothing

MOLLY
Cmon

Gnarled bloody faces snarl for Houston Multiple hands grab
hold of him pull at him He’s done for

The boy suddenly arches He rattles inhales and EXHALES

SPLAT Blood dots Molly’s mask She staggers away from him
and rips the mask off

Houston screams the door falling away
Molly rolls to the rifle

BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM Houston dives away from the spray of
blood and shrapnel as Molly fires into the bottleneck

The workers shriek and fall finally dead Quiet

She and the fallen doctor trade a look both out of breath
The boy’s eyes gently blink open still pale but steady
wheezing coming from the tube in his throat Inhale Exhale
INT RANCH HOUSE CELLAR - NIGHT

THE SHOT GLASS rests in front of Ethan Across from him
Harper’s hand shakes as he points the gun at Thomas

MAD CROW HARPER
C’mon Little junior Either you
buy it or you both do So down the
hatch for Daddy

ETHAN
Don’t hardly know the man Don’t
care to So you can go ahead--
CLICK Harper hammers down the firing pin of his pistol
Ethan jumps terrified
MAD CROW HARPER
Good thing you wore that mask That
poker face needs some work

With his free hand Harper motions to the drink

Ethan takes a deep breath and his eyes fall on the shot
glass He looks over to his father

But Thomas doesn’t look back His old sunken eyes are fixed
on Harper burning a hateful hole through his goggled face

Breathing hard Ethan brings his hands back up to the table
Harper smirks and perks up

Ethan looks at the glass face tight Throat choked he
shakes his head and grabs the glass

MAD CROW HARPER (CONT’D)
Uh huh

Harper watches riveted
Thomas watches Harper

Ethan’s throat contracts eyes on the glass He looks over to
Thomas one last time shoulders heaving

Thomas finally looks at his son face steady Sure

Ethan squeezes his eyes shut red-faced and brings the glass
closer to his lips His breaths are sharp fast

Beside the table Thomas brings up a knee

Muffling his own scream Ethan shoots the shot of blood to
his mouth

Thomas kicks Harper’s chair and breaks it Harper falls his
pistol swinging towards Ethan and going off BLAM

The gun explodes by Ethan’s face and the shot spills
harmlessly to his shirt He falls backwards

Thomas is up and over Harper and yanks the gun from his hand

Harper rolls under the table and springs up driving the
tabletop into Thomas BOOM

The old man is pushed into the stone wall and crumples

Before Ethan can recover his hair is grabbed by Harper The

criminal produces a second pistol and presses it against

Ethan’s cheek Presses very hard

Fallen in the corner Thomas has a pistol fixed on Harper
MAD CROW HARPER (CONT’D)

Uh uh Thomas Drop it Or baby boy

gets it

Thomas pulls down the hammer

MAD CROW HARPER (CONT’D)
Perhaps your hearing’s going

THOMAS
Heard ya clear as day you son of a
bitch It’d be worth the chore of
guttin’ you alive fifty times over
just for the goddamn satisfaction

MAD CROW HARPER
Ah ha Now there’s the Thomas
Little I remember Almost had me
fooled here in your cozy little
house Your locomotive pictures
Your welcome mat

Ethan squirms and reaches back It’s no use Harper has him

ETHAN
(whisper )
T-Thomas

MAD CROW HARPER
Yeah sorry Thomas but I already
know the story that ends with you
just shooting me Put that down so
Little junior here can go back to
shooing big scary characters away
from the rest of his boring life

THOMAS
You think I give a shit don’t ya

They don’t make outlaws like they
used to Ill tell ya Go on ahead
Shoot him

Ethan pauses stunned at the new tone in Thomas’ voice
Harper opens his mouth but nothing comes out

THOMAS (CONTD)
Spawn of a rotten two bit whore
Left him where she squatted him out
thirty years ago and never looked
back And you think I give a shit
now You poor sumbitch Go on

ETHAN
(whisper tears)
Please

Harper can’t believe it He almost stammers

THOMAS
Fuckin’ hell Guess no one ever
schooled ya in bein’ a fuckin’ man

Harper tilts his head Ethan squeezes his eyes shut Both
feel the sting on that one

THOMAS (CONTD)
Guess I hafta do it my goddamn
self

ETHAN
Pa

Thomas adjusts his aim and BLAM fires
SHOOTING ETHAN

The bullet sends Ethan spinning to the ground Harper jumps
back horrified

Thomas fires on Harper BLAM BLAM BLAM
Harper stumbles and races away He disappears up the stairs

Face down in the dirt Ethan he rolls over and blood flows
out of his shoulder He holds the wound as he comes to

Thomas yanks himself to his feet an old fire in his eyes
THOMAS
Hit that damn bastard Hit ‘em
Still got it Hot fuckin’ damn

Ethan looks up at his father Absolutely astonished

INT RANCH HOUSE DEN - NIGHT
Harper exits the hallway and collapses by the table
Not in pain In shock He covers his mouth

He collects himself and goes to the door

EXT RANCH HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Harper stops in the porch doorway Just beyond the house by
a horse Houston freezes child in his arms eyes on Harper

CLICK Harper turns Molly has the rifle on him Her eyes are
piercing Aim steady

Harper needs the doorway for support He wheezes
In the dark her jaw trembles He waits

MAD CROW HARPER
That ain’t ever suited you Mol

She stares into his face and stifles tears

He keeps his eyes on her meaning it

And her aim wavers falls

He turns away and leaves

The barrel dips to the floor Molly leans on the rifle and
catches her breath bitterness on her face

EXT RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT

Harper lumbers up the hill He bleeds his steps erratic

Ethan emerges from the house and spots Harper up on a hill
He hobbles after him his calls echo

ETHAN
Harper

Rifle in hand he can only aim his one healthy arm He swings
up the gun and fires angry BANG

Even when earth tears up beside him by a rifle shot Harper
doesn’t turn back He makes a crooked path towards

EXT THE OIL RIG - CONTINUOUS

It reaches up at the stars tall and stark Menacing

Harper collapses at the platform ladder and spits out of
breath He goes to move past the rig but stops

Beyond the rig MORE STRICKEN lumber out of the barracks
dazed and growling Stragglers They spot Harper

Harper swings back around and grabs the platform ladder
Ethan limps and swings the rifle up again BLAM

ETHAN
Harper

Drooling Harper climbs the rig First the ladder to the rig
floor and then the rig tower itself

Reaching the ladder Ethan looks up

ETHAN (CONT’D)
It’s over Harper

Harper ignores and slowly climbs His movements languid but
relentless A sick animal

With his one good arm Ethan tosses the rifle on his back and
pulls himself up He climbs after Harper clearing the rig
floor and hoisting himself up on the tower beams

ETHAN (CONTD)
Hold it there

Breeze in his greasy hair Harper hooks his arm around a beam
and clings

Ethan sees this and keeps climbing But halts
Harper shudders but not with sickness with laughter
Brow taut Ethan hears something below him and looks down

Nearly a dozen stricken are CLIMBING UP AFTER HIM Gnashing
hissing biting Yellowed eyes gleaming in the moonlight

Three stories up ETHAN IS TRAPPED
MAD CROW HARPER
Who has the high ground now Mr
Sheriff

The stricken already graze Ethan’s boots He tries to kick
one away but loses his footing

He slips down a rung and catches himself Another stricken
roars RIGHT IN HIS FACE Ethan pushes its throat and it
tumbles down the beams bouncing off the rungs THWAK-THWAK

The others grab at his feet Yank his clothes Bear their
teeth There are too many all desperate to rip Ethan apart

Doom washing over him Ethan looks down at the mass of
them his eye catching something

Harper watches curious

Ethan kicks off another worker and tests his balance on his
rung sharp breaths in and out AND HE LEAPS

Harper pivots to see Ethan plummet off the tower towards

The WALKING BEAM the weighted see-saw arm that drives the
drill Ethan reaches and grabs the outside end crying out

The arm squeals and dips with the weight of his fall Legs
swinging wild Ethan loses his grip

He falls to the ground abd loses his rifle He turns over
eyes squeezed shut wind knocked out of him

The arm peaks and comes down pushing the drill into the
ground One giant thrust The whole mechanism GROANS

The ground rumbles

Up high Harper feels it He looks down
Ethan looks

The well is silent Then

ROOOOAAARRRR A GEYSER OF OIL erupts up from the earth It
rockets up the rig tower and blows the peak apart BOOM

Wood splinters the force blowing Harper and most of the
stricken off the rig

Ethan shields himself from the black rain drenched He gets
to his feet and backs away from the rig Behind him Molly
rushes up the hill rifle in hand

MOANING Oil hammering him Harper stirs He pulls his face
up from the ground Alive He slips but gets upright

Around him more fallen stricken stir stunned and hobbled

Harper spits black disoriented His finds Ethan Molly not
too far in the distance Thomas even further behind her

Molly stops at a careful distance breathless rifle in her
hands She blinks the black drops away from her eyes

Harper raises his arms and arches his head back He takes a
shaky step towards Ethan wrists out

MAD CROW HARPER (CONT’D)
All right All right Mr Sheriff
You can show ‘em now Show
everyone
Harper gestures with his wrists A surrender
Both men look as Thomas arrives stomping his eyes wild
By his side a GIANT HUNTING KNIFE Just like the stories

Blood splattered he shakes with rage A man possessed

Calm Ethan shakes his head He realizes

ETHAN
Ain’t nothing to show nobody

Thomas pushes a concerned Molly away fixed on Harper
completely unreachable

Harper watches His hands fall to his side

MAD CROW HARPER
Right right My-- my mistake

No one moves They get drenched Harper coughs It bends him
over getting violent He’s at the end

Harper looks at Molly and unable to catch his breath WAVES
HER AWAY Again and again

She starts to lower her rifle

MOLLY
Adrian

AND HARPER REACHES UNDER HIS CAPE
Every muscle clenches Molly brings the rifle to eye level

MOLLY (CONT’D)
No Don’t

Harper’s rocked by more coughs He staggers and side-steps
But his hand stays under his cape

Ethan hasn’t moved His eyes shift
HIS RIFLE lies in the grass not ten feet away

MOLLY (CONTD)
Stay away from him

Brow low Thomas watches mouthing words to himself
Harper continues circle Ethan wracked with sickness

MOLLY (CONTD)
Damn you Adrian Don’t do this

He shakes his head waving again with his free hand
Ethan looks holds his look on Harper His hand flexes
Harper looks to Ethan second hand going under the cape

MOLLY (CONTD)
No

Molly fires Once Twice

Harper’s body twitches as the shots rip into him

Ethan slides on the black grass and grabs the fallen rifle
He SWINGS IT AROUND HIS HEAD steadying his aim on the crook
of his neck Fluid quick

BLAM

Harper’s head jerks Black mist Between the eyes He tips
Harper falls limp and splashes to the grass He lies still

Molly collapses all fours unable to hold in a scream

Keyed up Ethan looks at Harper’s fallen body making sure it
stays down this time Satisfied Ethan gets to his feet

Harper lies twisted Pale DEAD

Over Harper Ethan stares at the body stone-faced He
reaches down and rips the cape off him

A tiny FLAME dances in Harper’s hidden hand THE MATCHES

ETHAN
Get back

A deep inhale of oxygen Ethan scrambles away from the body
as it BURSTS INTO FLAMES

The fire light on his face stirs Thomas He snaps out of it
Molly looks up and sees She grabs her father’s shirt

MOLLY
Ethan

A blue lip of flame glides over the ground
Over the bodies

Over growling hobbled stricken

And closer to the rig the surging oil

The Littles sprint away from the scene Ethan straggles
behind The flames chase them

ETHAN
Go go go go go

Fire licks at Ethan’s heels He can feel the heat

More of it slithers and snakes through the rig

ETHAN (CONTD)
GO

It EXPLODES BOOM Wood debris flames fly

The Littles are knocked flat by the force but hit dry
ground They brace themselves as splinters fall around them

The rig is completely blown away Ablaze the geyser ROARS a
SIX STORY STREAM OF FIRE But under the roar

The last stricken crawl and shriek consumed in the fire

The Littles recover and watch hearing it Affected

The blistering faces The shaking limbs The howls of agony

THOMAS
Jesus Mary and Joseph

Tearful Molly stares at a flaming heap Harper’s body
Ethan finds it too His face becomes pained He storms away

Thomas reaches for him

THOMAS (CONTD)
Son I didn’t--

Ethan pulls away And walks

They watch him go Ethan never looks back the fire a massive
red lantern behind him

DISSOLVE TO

INT WAYWARD SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY

Along the row of PLAQUES of past sheriffs Banks Ethan And
the last one “Cody Jameson Valiant Deputy in the
Apprehension of Adrian Harper and his Posse of Outlaws” On
mounted hooks someone places a revolver It’s handsome

It’s Ethan Wounds almost healed over arm in a sling Alone
examines the names He takes a deep breath and leaves

Left behind on the desk is the SHERIFF’S STAR

INT WAYWARD TOWN STRETCH - DAY

TOWNS PEOPLE women men children The all look up at the
sound of a horse passing Some quickly look away Some glare
Some whisper to each other There are no smiles

Ethan passes them on horseback He doesn’t look to them He
rides on brim down They’re not even there

EXT LITTLE HOMESTEAD - DAY
The small house in the big desert A wagon out front

ETHAN (0S)
We didn’t finish it It could still
be out there

Not too far from the house Ethan stands by a woodpile Leg
up Hat on Straw in his mouth Looking over the landscape

Houston holds the reins of a horse The child sits in the
saddle squinting in the sun bandage around his neck

HOUSTON
It’s true There could be survivors
we missed We’1ll never really know
unless it rears its head again

Ethan doesn’t look away from the horizon Houston notices

HOUSTON (CONTD)
But we did a good job

He means it but Ethan doesn’t respond He shuts his eyes

ETHAN
I noticed you haven’t packed
What’s a big city doc stayin’
‘round these parts for

Houston looks to the ground and nods

HOUSTON
I’ve telegraphed some colleagues
and they’re coming out to examine
the boy
(beat)
But in the meantime there’s
someone else I’d like to consult

Ethan looks at the doctor confused and spots Houston’s
glance Ethan turns to catch the doctor’s line of sight

Waiting in the distance are THE NAVAJO Majestic on a hill

ETHAN
You think they’1ll do any good
Houston looks out at the Indians
HOUSTON
I believe we can’t stop trying

Even out here

Ethan catches a sight over Houston’s shoulder In front of
the house Molly and Ethan’s wife Grace load up a wagon

Ethan stands up straight offers his hand

ETHAN
Doctor

Houston looks to Ethan’s face They shake hands

HOUSTON
Sheriff

Ethan reaches up and slaps his big hat on the child’s head
The boy smiles and LAUGHS Finally

FRONT OF THE HOUSE Ethan approaches the wagon packed with
all of the Littles’ things Grace and Molly hug It’s long
and sad Molly turns to see her brother

MOLLY
Well you’re all set to scamper

Ethan takes in the wagon hands on his hips He nods
MOLLY (CONTD)
You better get fixin’ to read once
you get East I’m gonna write you
every day Twice

ETHAN
That don’t mean I have to does it

Molly rushes her brother and ferociously hugs him almost
knocking him back He holds her tight

In the wagon Grace is touched

MOLLY
I gave you such a rough time

ETHAN
I don’t reckon that’1l change now

Buried in his shoulder she laughs and sniffles She looks up
at him face streaked with tears

MOLLY
You’re always the one who knows
better What am I gonna do without
you around

ETHAN
Hey You were always the tougher
one
(beat)
Better never counted for much
‘round these parts anyway
A sob wells up in her again She pauses to get the words out

MOLLY
Ethan It counted

Eyes red-rimmed Ethan smiles They hug again
Up on the wagon Grace has the reins all their possessions
tied up behind her Ethan boards taking the horses and

meeting his wife’s warm eyes They kiss Relief

Ethan looks back at Molly Houston leads the child on the
horse only few steps behind her

Ethan looks at them but can’t help but focus on

THE WASTELAND behind them Stretching out forever distorted
by incessant heat A distant SHRIEK He looks up

Against the blinding massive SUN a lone BLACK BIRD circles
above them A buzzard A crow Ethan can’t tell

He doesn’t care He slaps the reins Off they go

Molly Houston and the boy watch them as they become
smaller and smaller

Until they’re a black dot on the horizon

FADE OUT

THE END
