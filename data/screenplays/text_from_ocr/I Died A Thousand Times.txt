INT SEEDY HOTEL ROOM - THE CITY - DAY

A lifestyle for the truly foul and mundane Holes in walls
Single light bulb dangles from wire Pimps prostitutes and

Seconds tick Then

MAN arches up wildly into the air jolted as if by electric
shock then collapses back onto the squeaky mattress

Moments later MAN blinks his eyes with LIFE He whispers

MAN

MAN rises disoriented trembling as he clumsily enters
BATHROOM

and retches puking poison into toilet He rises moves to
CRACKED MIRROR

Through split reflection we see not the MAN’S face weve
been seeing but a disheveled-looking death-pale JUNKIE 30s

(READER’S NOTE Viewer will see character of MAN as the
actor portraying him However the other characters in this
script will see MAN as the Junkie body in which he inhabits)

He scrutinizes every inch of his emaciated slightly muscular
body as if inspecting for poor tailoring on a new suit He
splashes steamy water onto face Something CRASHES to the
floor He looks down at a bloody SYRINGE beside his feet

MAN
Damn junkies

MAN grabs for a towel and a wallet falls out of hiding
landing in sink He searches through it Empty -- except
for a driver’s license belonging to a CURTIS RANOWSKI

He holds license up to mirror sees that Ranowski’s photo
matches the Junky’s reflection His face The mask he wears

Host almost got me killed again

DOGHEAD
Thought I could get you in and out
of there before the Cops arrived
and things got nasty My mistake

Doghead shrugs not caring Lorredo turns and looks at
Ranowski’s reflection in two-way mirror feels his new face

LORREDO
Who was this Ranowski

DOGHEAD
A junkie who killed a squeeze and
chose to drown his sorrow on an
overdose of heroin and self-pity

Lorredo’s deadpan face and uncaring unfeeling eyes reflect
not a spark of emotion or hope as he stares down at Doghead

LORREDO
Let’s have it

Doghead takes final drag on cigarette held between twig-like
burned fing-s speaks through stained canine-like teeth

be taken Contract to be signed

LORREDO
Profile on Hamby

Doghead slides a manila file with numerous ringed coffee
stains on the cover through small opening in the wire
Lorredo opens it to find a photo of Hamby and a data sheet

DOGHEAD
Hamby was to be executed in the
gas chamber Instead he was
paroled on a legal technicality

Lorredo closes file slides it back through opening
DOGHEAD
Hamby’s so-called talents have
become a burden to The Company

LORREDO
Any other instructions
Doghead slides out a pair of black LEATHER GLOVES and
SUNGLASSES Lorredo puts on gloves Rubs his hands

DOGHEAD
None Better not fuck this one
up Lorredo -- you haven’t been

utilized for awhile And that host
body doesn’t make you immortal

A ghost of a grin crosses over Lorredo’s face

LORREDO
(sarcastic)
I’m touched at your concern
Doghead I’ve missed you too

Lorredo proceeds out Light spilling off monitors
illuminates the demonic orange-amber glow in Lorredo’s eyes

DOGHEAD
Save your poor attempts at humor
for others of your kind Sifter
And address me by my proper title
Lorredo opens door turning back Cold winter light of day
bleaches him out into a menacing silhouette Except his face

LORREDO
(putting on
sunglasses)
Sorry Latin’s not my strongpoint
Doghead And try not to fall
asleep smoking in bed again

Lorredo exits swallowed up by the over-abundance of light
EXT CITY STREET - NIGHT

Dark Old industrial part of city in final stages of decay
Only residents here are the homeless dregs living out of
cardboard shelters and huddling around flaming garbage cans

Lorredo approaches a shadow moving through the night
passing a high cyclone barbed-wire fence of a wrecking yard

LORREDO (VO)
In The Company as in any large
organization -- things go wrong
TWO GERMAN SHEPHERDS

appear suddenly behind fence BARKING ferociously at Lorredo
He stops locks eyes with dogs They cower off whimpering

LORREDO (VO)

Lorredo crosses to storefronts all closed for the night He
stops at a BUTCHER SHOP A sign reads HAMBY MEATS

LORREDO (VO)
Accounts left unsettled

EXT HAMBY MEATS - NIGHT

Lorredo a man on a mission proceeds around to rear of
building into garbage-strewn alleyway He stops in front of
a steel fortified door with Service Entrance printed on it

LORREDO (VO)
When my Employers decide direct
intervention is required --

Lorredo’s gloved hand knocks on door with a resounding thud

LORREDO (VO)
I get a new lease on life in the
bodies of the recently expired

A tall slightly obese man opens door dressed in a soiled
white t-shirt and dungarees gnawing furiously on a messy
barbecue rib getting every morsel Meet JOHN HAMBY 43

LORREDO

Hamby chews off the remaining tidbit from rib tosses it
outside wipes his greasy hands and mouth on his t-shirt

HAMBY
At this hour

Lorredo notes rib lying at his feet then enters past Hamby
INT HAMBY’S PLACE
Hamby closes door turns deadbolts locking them inside A

wall divides morbid living space from butcher shop in front
Numerous black lights bathe area in a deep blue hue
Red orange and white painted cockroaches dart across floor
in glowing streaks Hamby painted them for his amusement

LORREDO
Mind if I have a look around

HAMBY
Go right ahead Feel free I’m
going to finish eating my dinner

Hamby sits back down at table and consumes giant plate of
ribs as he watches a contestant spin Wheel of Fortune on tv

INT KITCHEN AREA

Lorredo enters past strings of tiny bones that hang in
doorway like beads He finds the large sink cluttered with
dirty pots and pans Something’s cooking in a big pot

HAMBY (0S)
(eating w mouthful)
Second time this month you
assholes knocked on my door --
don’t you people have lives

INT LIVING AREA

Lorredo exits kitchen

LORREDO
When it comes to quality control
Mr Hamby we never sleep

Dominating place are numerous taxidermic animals dogs cats
birds mostly with a few wall-hanging game heads Creepy
thing about them are their eyes -- they have human eyes As
if their original eyes had been substituted for human ones

LORREDO
I see you’ve been staying busy

HAMBY
Taxidermy’s a hobby of mine I’ve
always liked to work with my hands

Hamby displays his large hand -- twice the normal human size
Lorredo knocks on padlocked door of ADJOINING ROOM to kitchen

LORREDO
What’s in here
Hamby eyes Lorredo suspiciously

HAMBY
M-my trophy roon

Lorredo approaches giant walk-in freezer across room the
only element of the butcher shop kept in this divided area

HAMBY
Grade A beef See for yourself

Lorredo opens freezer door Only one florescent light burns
and it flickers Meat hangs on hooks A cloud of vapor
conceals most of the freezer Nothing out of ordinary

LORREDO
How’s business these days

Lorredo closes freezer door and takes a seat at table across
from Hamby now picking his teeth with a wooden toothpick

HAMBY
Ain’t complainin’ Any surplus
meat I give to charity Never
know how doin’ a good deed in this
life might help you in the next

Hamby smiles -- exposing upper and lower rows of ghastly
yellowed razor-sharp teeth Filed to a point Shark teeth
LORREDO
Given your talents Hamby -- I’m

afraid you’re wasting your time
Hamby belches points at Lorredo with his toothpick

HAMBY
There’s something odd about you

LORREDO
How do you mean

HAMBY
Most Inspectors who come here --
first words out of their mouth are
‘who’s my supplier’ But not you

LORREDO
Maybe I already know Maybe I
don’t care to know Maybe --

o HAMBY
Maybe you’re not an inspector
Maybe you’re an undercover cop

Hamby studies Lorredo with the eyes of a predator

LORREDO
I’m no cop that I can assure you
HAMBY
If you ain’t a health inspector
and you ain’t no cop -- then what

the fuck you doin’ here man

LORREDO
You’ve exceeded your quota Time
for you to close shop Permanently

Lorredo tosses an old contract down in front of Hamby
LORREDO

less edges worn silk-smooth from years of use

LORREDO
I told you I’m an emissary sent

Hamby signs contract He looks up at Lorredo and begins to
laugh -- displaying those frightful razor teeth of his
Lorredo also laughs Hamby laughs harder A tense moment

HAMBY‘S HAND

slides cleaver out of sheath Both of them suddenly stop
laughing All is quiet Hamby’s hand freezes on cleaver
With a trembling hand he releases handle and we see why

LORREDO

has the barrel of his gun pressed against Hamby’s forehead
Lorredo shows no emotion not a twitch of remorse -- only a
face of cold stone He cocks trigger back Grins spitefully

LORREDO
Burn well Johnny boy

Before Lorredo can fire Hamby jumps up in a fit of rage
flipping table over -- the corner of which hits Lorredo’s
arm catapulting his gun out of his hand and across room

Hamby explodes into violence picking Lorredo off his feet
tossing him through air sending him CRASHING through a
wall and into TROPHY ROOM Lorredo breaks his fall on

INT TROPHY ROOM -- A ROW OF SHELVES

containing several glass jars of human body parts hearts
livers kidneys intestines all preserved in formaldehyde

Numerous human trophy heads adorn walls with various frozen
expressions on faces ranging from happy to sheer terror

Several disemboweled human bodies hang from ceiling on meat
hooks exposing Hamby for what he truly is -- A CANNIBAL

HAMBY
charges at Lorredo with meat cleaver

Lorredo attempts to get to his feet to grab his gun -- but
his feet slip on spilled organs and he falls back down

Hamby swings cleaver at Lorredo who dodges kicking Hamby
between the legs causing Hamby to topple down onto Lorredo
as his cleaver instead cleaves into side casing of freezer

They struggle Hamby bites into Lorredo’s shoulder Blood
spurts Lorredo cries out hammering Hamby’s face with his
fist until Hamby releases his shark teeth coated with blood

Hamby pulls cleaver free as Lorredo SMASHES Hamby’s head
with a jar of formaldehyde causing Hamby to stumble back

Hamby gathers his senses his shirt soaked with formaldehyde

LORREDO (VO)
There’s only one rule in my
profession Above everything At
all costs stay alive

Hanging corpses swing on hooks bumping into each other

LORREDO (VO)
Dying on the job isn’t allowed

Lorredo is trapped His gun hopelessly out of his reach

LORREDO
Expire before the job is completed
and you’ll burn The Company
doesn’t give second chances

Hamby lets out a guttural growl like that of a rabid animal
and charges Lorredo with cleaver raised

Lorredo flicks flame on his BUTANE and tosses it at Hamby
igniting his shirt drenched in formaldehyde Flames consume
his body Hamby stops spins around screaming for a moment

Lorredo dives for his gun grabbing it as Hamby charges him
again lLorredo rolls onto his back takes aim at the human
torch running toward him yelling swinging cleaver Insane

BLAM -- Lorredo fires ONCE TWICE THREE times But
Hamby keeps coming -- bullets only feeding his raging fury

Lorredo empties the chamber and clicks empty Hamby reaches
trapped Lorredo and stops cleaver raised high with both
hands now ready to swing down and Slay Lorredo But

Hamby falls straight over dead Lorredo dives out of his
way aS Hamby hits floor and engulfs nearby sofa into flames

Lorredo gets to his feet approaches Hamby now a cooking
heap of flesh Lorredo sighs with relief He reholsters
gun wipes blood from side of his neck where Hamby bit him

Contingent upon you taking this
case of course Choice is yours

life that made it worth living

DOGHEAD
But with a new life also comes a
second chance to be with Helen

DOGHEAD
Rest assured -- that since you
alone pulled the trigger on
Helen -- that you alone took her
life -- she didn’t share your fate

Doghead places a BLACK ENVELOPE containing Lorredo’s PARDON

coward thinks suicide is painless

The words stab deeply into Lorredo Doghead grins spitefully

Instead of boarding Bus Nichols steps in path of Fire Engine

He doesn’t flinch as Fire Engine mows him down dragging his
body underneath before hitting brakes skidding on icy street

Lorredo calmly watches as horrified PEDESTRIANS dash to Fire
Engine underneath which lies Nichols very much dead Lorredo
proceeds down sidewalk unaffected

Nichols is the kind of guy who
took a dive through a greenhouse
roof Landing dead in front of a

Dark dreary Two eight story buildings built side-by-side
with a courtyard of dead trees running the length in between

LORREDO (VO)
What Nichols had mentioned about
there being a heaven-sent
operative a Joy Boy --

Lorredo enters looking up at the eight stories and separate
tiered lofts that loom above him on both sides like levels
of a penitentiary Decaying cement walls have been partially
dismantled giving the place a mausoleum-like appearance

LORREDO (VO)
Given that name because they were
said to always die with smiles on
their faces -- had to be false

Lorredo steps past an old chipped fountain centerpiece of St
Sebastian with only its upper torso and a few iron arrows
still intact Also missing are Sebastian’s outstretched hands

LORREDO (VO)
Joys existed as nothing more than
superstition Fairy-tale angels
created by Sifters hoping for a
happy ending but never got one

Lorredo knocks on door with sign that reads LANDLORD

did Had an eye for restoring
lost things from the past stuff

paintings and canvases that crowd every inch of floor of wall

need for my line of work anymore

LORREDO

fascinating

Landlord leads Lorredo over to where high metal scaffolding
is positioned in front of two ominous twelve-foot paintings

LANDLORD
Ancient languages is my specialty
Managing this place pays the bills
Lorredo is at once intrigued and captivated by the work
LANDLORD
I believe she was restoring these
paintings the day she disappeared

Lorredo puts Franklin in Landlord’s palm He refuses it

LANDLORD
Just find her She was a good kid

Lorredo nods re-pockets money proceeds to Emily’s SLEEPING

NEUMEYER
What can I do for you
(reading card)
Mr Lorredo

LORREDO
I’m investigating the
disappearance of one of your
patients named Emily Wharton

NEUMEYER
I don’t recall treating anyone by
that name here at this clinic

Lorredo pulls out the bottle of codeine pills that he took
from Emily’s loft pointing to the typed-written label

LORREDO
That’s your name isn’t it

Neumeyer looks at it nods

NEUMEYER
I’m sure you’re aware that it’s
illegal for me to give out any
information about my patients

LORREDO
I just want to find the woman
Your cooperation on the matter
will be greatly appreciated

Lorredo takes a seat on the leather sofa allowing his coat
to fall open exposing his gun in holster for Neumeyer to
see Neumeyer eyes it nervously clears his throat

NEUMEYER
Of course Anything to help

Receptionist enters hands a manila file to Neumeyer then
exits On file is the name Emily Wharton Neumeyer sets
file on desk and begins looking through it

NEUMEYER
Emily came to me almost three
months ago complaining about pain
in the lower abdominal region I
ran some tests on her and
diagnosed her to have
choriocarcinoma -- a rapidly
developing cancer in the uterus
that results from unremoved fetal
tissue from having an abortion

LORREDO
Bad enough to cause her death

Neumeyer anxious for unknown reasons begins to sweat
NEUMEYER
Yes yes most definitely By
the time I diagnosed her with
having cancer it had already
Spread throughout most of her
body into her brain -- lungs even

LORREDO
May I

Neumeyer hands Lorredo Emily’s file He reads

LORREDO
Says here the last time you
treated her was on the third of
December That was two weeks
before her disappearance

NEUMEYER
Yes that’s when I prescribed the
codeine to her for the pain

LORREDO
There’s no other entry on this
chart after that date Did you
stop treating her at that point

NEUMEYER
She never came back Guess she
felt there was nothing else I
could’ve done -- nothing else
anyone could’ve done for her

LORREDO
How long did she have left

NEUMEYER
Hard to say exactly -- four maybe
five weeks at the most More than
likely Ms Wharton’s already dead

Neumeyer gets up from desk

NEUMEYER
Now you must excuse me Mr
Lorredo I have patients waiting

They closed this section of subway
up at the turn of the century --
back when they built the new line
Nobody’s been in there for the
past 75 years Here -- this is it

They reach area where a 6’x4’ hole has been chiseled through

the jeebs
Phaelon’s voice echoes miles off through the blackness

FANCY
Never know what could be down here

They proceed a short distance stop as their beams locate a
series of elaborate drawings on tunnel wall

PHAELON
What the fuck you think this is

ON TUNNEL WALL
We recognize this symbol as KERN SYMBOL branded on Disciple’s

arms Accompanied by more macabre drawings Demonic-type
creatures Stuff that nightmares are made of

Fancy nods heads off in other direction Their flashbeams
allowing them to see only small oval areas at a time Eerie

Fancy falls over something in the dark He rolls onto his
Side shining his beam over to see what it was -- his face
fills with terror and he stumbles back getting to his feet

We see only Phaelon’s flashbeam zigzagging in all directions
as Phaelon runs the hundred yard dash in just under six
seconds over to where Fancy was standing moments ago

PHAELON

Phaelon searches with beam until he locates Fancy sitting on
ground several feet away staring mortified over in corner

Fancy is too shook up to utter a reply -- all he can do is
point Phaelon follows his trajectory with his beam over to

down checking to see if he’s concealing weapons

THUDDING down on car’s hood then roll-tumbles down to
ground Flaming Disciple Driver jumps from car and collapses

into pile of snow several feet away extinguishing himself

A beat Chevvy and dumpster burn We hear movement

Lorredo squeezes through dumpster’s crushed opening removes
smouldering trash clinging to him He reaches for his gun

and burns his hand on hot metal then uses coat to grab it up
He then looks back up with alarm as

BURN-CHARRED DISCIPLE

passenger of Chevvy topples over onto hin

Lorredo dodges it looking down at person burned beyond all
recognition Eyes darting up at him from charred sockets

LORREDO
Who are you -- why were you
following me -- answer me

Charred Disciple opens mouth to speak emitting only smoke
Lorredo sees movement out of the corner of his eye and turns
to see Disciple Driver stumbling to his feet and racing away

Lorredo chases him back out into street and stops searching
around Disciple’s gone Then Lorredo spots Disciple racing
down stairs leading to subway Lorredo proceeds after him
INT SUBWAY BOARDING PLATFORM

Lorredo draws his gun as he descends stairs but keeps it
concealed from view as he searches crowded area for Disciple
FURTHER DOWN BOARDING AREA -- DISCIPLE

blanketed by shadows and hides in doorway with gun ready

LORREDO

gun poised reaches same shadowy section of tunnel He passes
by Disciple concealed in darkness As he does Lorredo kicks
an emtpy beer bottle that clamors off in the darkness

A PAIR OF EYES

belonging to same miserable SANTA CLAUS who was after Lorredo
earlier -- snap awake alerted by bottle He sits up on his
mattress still wearing his soiled red suit and tangled beard

LORREDO
stops turns sensing danger then continues forward
DISCIPLE

steps out of the doorway and takes precise aim on
unsuspecting Lorredo from behind Just as

SANTA CLAUS

half-drugged lunges out of darkness behind Lorredo with a
switchblade -- stepping directly into Disciple’s line of fire

SANTA CLAUS
Time to pay the piper Ranowski

BLAM -- Santa’s chest explodes as he’s hit from behind by
Disciple’s bullet meant for Lorredo Santa falls dead

Lorredo turns and fires on Disciple hitting him in right-

himself out directly into the path of speeding train

INT PRECINCT HOUSE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Lorredo sits at table smoking cig staring into the large
two-way mirror at RANOWSKI’S JUNKIE FACE that now has a few
bruises and a bandage that covers a cut above his right eye

Fancy sits beside Lorredo Phaelon paces with determination

LORREDO
Do I look like a killer to you

PHAELON
Put it this way your face meets
all the necessary requirements

FANCY
Stand in front of mirror lately

PHAELON
Frankly Lorredo you look like
one of them vampires on a day pass

LORREDO
If you’re trying to pin a murder
rap on me for that train jumper --
Phaelon gives Lorredo a pat on shoulder to reassure him
PHAELON
Relax We saw the guy powder his
own nose Didn’t we Fancy
Fancy tediously spins Lorredo’s forty-five that lies on table

FANCY
Yeah saw the whole show

Phaelon holds up Lorredo’s ID
PHAELON

Says here Lorredo you’re employed
by the Pinkerton Detective Agency

LORREDO
That’s right

PHAELON
Didn’t think there were any of you
Pukes-- I mean Pinks still

workin’ the mean streets

Phaelon tosses Lorredo back his wallet He puts it away

LORREDO
We like to keep a low profile
unlike most of you Two-plys

Phaelon and Lorredo lock eyes

PHAELON
Pinks were nothin’ but vigilantes
Thinkin’ they’re above the law
when they weren’t

FANCY
So what’s a Two-ply

Lorredo stares at Phaelon as he says this

LORREDO
It’s what we used to call cops
who’s idea of fighting crime was
sitting around wipin’ their asses

Phaelon restrains himself from hitting Lorredo

LORREDO
Well if I’m not a murder
suspect -- I got better things to
do then keep flies off doughnuts

Lorredo starts to get up Phaelon pushes Lorredo back down

PHAELON
Sit down We’re not through yet

Phaelon brings out book that Lorredo took from Disciple and
tosses it down on table It has the KERN SYMBOL on cover

PHAELON
We got one question for you
Where did you get this book

LORREDO
Bought it in a used book store

Phaelon punches Lorredo knocking cigarette out of his mouth

PHAELON
(displaying his fist)
Sorry Just does that on its own
whenever it detects a wrong answer
Bile

Lorredo retrieves cig from floor now bent in half putting
it back in mouth rubbing jaw eyeing Phaelon angrily

LORREDO
Look it would make it a lot
easier for me to cooperate if
you’d tell me what this is about

FANCY
Don’t you read the papers

LORREDO
Not lately Why

PHAELON
Maybe this’1l refresh your memory

Phaelon tosses down the front page of the City Times
newspaper Headline reads Killer Cult Discovered
accompanied by photo of subway where bodies where found

FANCY
This look familiar d
Fancy tosses down several 8x10 bw photos taken of mummified
victims One photo shows Kern Symbol on tunnel wall
Lorredo studies each one closely concealing his surprise

LORREDO
There’s more to this than you
think It’s bigger than you know

FANCY
Somethin’ big huh What exactly
do you know about it

LORREDO
Probably just as much as you I’m
still putting together the pieces

Phaelon grabs Lorredo’s arm pulls up sleeve to expose small
needle tracks -- remnants of Ranowski’s past drug addictions

PHAELON
And I s’pose this is the map to
the buried treasure -- and the x
marks the spot Real big alright
Lorredo pulls back his arm lowering his sleeve

LORREDO
Didn’t your mother tell you to
never judge a book by its cover

PHAELON
Yeah But you being a junkie
makes it a whole different story

LORREDO
Look we’re after the same people
who did this -- and right now you
need all the help you can get

PHAELON
I don’t partner up with vigilantes

LORREDO
That fine I work alone

Phaelon kicks chair out from under Lorredo sending him

CRASHING to floor Phaelon grabs Lorredo goes to punch hin
but Lorredo counters -- throwing Phaelon up against the wall

FANCY (0S)
Hold it

Lorredo turns to see Fancy
Phaelon wipes blood from mouth

PHAELON
Put it away Fancy Now

Fancy does Phaelon grimaces grabbing his stomach like the

whole incident has given him indigestion

PHAELON
Damn Know what Trichinosis is

Lorredo shakes his head Phaelon pours some liquid medicine

into his coffee stirs it

Fi PHAELON
A godamn tapeworm Take my wife
over to Haiti for a second
honeymoon This is my souvenir

Phaelon drinks it down with a sour face It tastes bad

PHAELON
How do you like them penguins --
a goddamn worm imbeddin’ itself in
my diaphragm A fuckin’ worm

Phaelon touches the middle of his chest
LORREDO
Wanna keep at it or do you want
to find out who killed these
people
Lorredo holds up the newspaper pointing to the photo
Phaelon rub his sore jaw letting his meanness subside

PHAELON
What kinda deal you talkin’

Fancy nervously straightens his tie as he watches then

LORREDO

No deal Just let me walk
PHAELON

You better not be holding out on

me -- or so help me --
LORREDO

I’m not Believe me You want to
bring these people to justice you

Phaelon scrutinizes Lorredo not sure about hin

FANCY
Don’t trust him Phil

PHAELON
Let me handle this Fance

Phaelon thinks it over another few seconds then he decides
z PHAELON

Flake and there won’t be a place
in hell where you can hide from me

Lorredo smirks out of the corner of his mouth as he grabs his
forty-five off table shoves it back in his shoulder holster

Lorredo nods opens door starts out

Lorredo turns back the subdued light in the outer office

INT EMILY’S LOFT - NIGHT -- A GIANT HUMAN EYE

belonging to Landlord looks through a round magnifier
studying Disciple’s open book that Lorredo retrieved

LANDLORD
It’s written in ancient Akkadian
A substrate language -- a
combination of dialects that’s
been extinct since 2500 Bc

Landlord adjusts magnifier bringing ancient wedge-shaped
letters or cuneiform characters into focus

LANDLORD
If I had to venture a guess I’d
say this book is at least a couple
hundred years old Maybe more

Landlord then switches to looking at book under a microscope

LANDLORD
And it’s a copy -- a duplicate

Landlord raises up from microscope and turns to Lorredo

LANDLORD
Now I have a question for you r
Where on earth did you find this

LORREDO
Let’s just say I found it lying
around Can you translate it

LANDLORD
Heavens no This is way out of my
league I’m afraid But a good
friend of mine probably could

Landlord gets up from his desk and places the book open and
face down on a computer scanner Light quickly scans it He
goes to desk and types in a few commands on laptop computer

LANDLORD
From what little of it I can
understand -- it says something

about an Eighth Seal Gethsemane

Computer screen comes to life and begins translating ancient
Displaying Akkadian letters beside corresponding Latin text

LORREDO
My Bible skills are a little rusty

Landlord goes to bookshelf containing hundreds of books and
selects a large reference book sets it on his desk and
thumbs through it until he finds the page he was looking for

LANDLORD
What we’re talking about is
something that predates the Bible
by nearly two-thousand years

PAGE IN BOOK

Illustration of four nightmarish figures riding horses First
Horseman on white horse holds a bow Second on red horse
brandishes sword Third riding black horse holds a pair of
balances Forth rides a pale horse and holds a sickle

LANDLORD
The Book of Revelations in the
Bible mentions Four Horsemen
Death Disease Famine War

LORREDO
Opening of Seven Seals that begin
Judgement Day That sort of thing

Landlord nods in agreement watching more translated data
from book scroll down his laptop computer screen in Latin

LANDLORD
(reading screen text)
Well this Book also includes a
Fifth Horseman -- a Dark Messiah
Who will open an Eighth Seal and
herald in some kind of Dark
Resurrection called the Awakening

LORREDO
You mean like the end of the world

Landlord is silent as he reads through more of the text

LANDLORD
No Not an apocalypse but a
great transformation A time when
humanity will fall into darkness

LORREDO
What exactly is this Seal of
Gethsemane
63s

Landlord prints out an enlargement taken from Page of book

LANDLORD
See for yourself

Lorredo takes paper studies it closely
ON PAPER -- THE SEAL OF GETHSEMANE

Not really much to see The size of a fifty-cent-piece It’s
Oval Muddy- brown in color But there’s a mystical quality
about it Pressed into the middle of Seal -- by the very hand
of God -- is same KERN SYMBOL branded on every Disciple’s arm

LORREDO
This was branded on the arm of the
person who was carrying this book

Lorredo stares at Seal something else about it troubles hin

LORREDO
And I’ve seen this same symbol
someplace else before that But
I can’t remember where exactly

LANDLORD
Where

LORREDO
I don’t recall exactly -- but I
have I’m positive about that

He folds up paper and puts it into his pocket

LORREDO
You think any of this is
authentic -- any truth to it

LANDLORD
That’s like asking a person if he
believes in God From a purely
empirical point of view -- I have
my doubts But there’s one thing
I believe without any uncertainty

LORREDO
What’s that

LANDLORD
(handing back book)
What you have here is a lost
chapter missing from the Bible
Why it was removed is a mystery

Dawn A decaying building nestled between a tattoo parlor and
a beauty supply store Painted in black is GUIDING LIGHT

LORREDO
stands across street holding up Guiding Light brochure
INT GUIDING LIGHT

Lorredo enters dark windowless hallway with soiled
Carpeting Stark light filters in through the front door

Off to his immediate right
A THRIFT STORE
HOMELESS PEOPLE dig through boxes of used clothing The same
CABBIE with the voice box who gave Lorredo a ride earlier
greets Lorredo Lorredo recognizes him
CABBIE
(via voice box)
End of hall First door on left
Lorredo eyes him suspiciously then exits down dark hallway
A HOMELESS MAN

stops digging in box turns to reveal himself to be the same
Disheveled Bum who asked Lorredo for Spare change It’s --

MR HAPPY
his ever-smiling but menacing face watches Lorredo exit
IN DARK HALLWAY -- LORREDO

advances He stops at doorway that looks in on a cafeteria
where a handful of HOMELESS sit at tables eating food

FIRST DOOR ON LEFT

Lorredo opens door to a dark roon In the middle of the
darkness stands A FIGURE beneath a ray of light like a
shrouded apparition Lorredo draws his gun and enters

As Lorredo approaches gun poised coming closer he sees
that this seemingly brightly glowing figure is in fact --

EMILY WHARTON
facing him with outstretched arms palms up in supplication

Lorredo stops in front of her staring at her in disbelief
his gun still aimed at her Emily stands firn making no
effort to run -- as if she were expecting him to arrive A
glimmer of fear shows in her eyes as she sees gun

EMILY
You going to shoot Then shoot

Lorredo is suddenly aware that he’s pointing his gun at her

EMILY
Finish the job

Lorredo starts to pull trigger -- to carry out his
assignment -- to kill He grimaces Gun trembles in his
hand as he fights against himself It takes every ounce of
his will but Lorredo finds the strength to lower gun

LORREDO
I’ve already killed you once
I’1ll be damned if I do it again

EMILY
I’ve missed you

Emily steps forward to embrace Lorredo but he steps back
into the shadows not allowing her to touch hin

EMILY
What’s wrong

Emily advances toward him And again he steps back raising
his gloved hand to force a distence be kept between then

LORREDO
Nothing Nothing is wrong Just
the man you once knew is dead

EMILY
I don’t believe you He May think
that he is But somewhere deep
inside him that man still lives

Lorredo steps half-way out of shadows

LORREDO
Why did you come back Helen

(READERS NOTE For purposes of clarity from this point
Onward in the script Emily will now be referred to as Helen )

EMILY HELEN
For you

Lights come on flooding room with brightness Lorredo
turns aiming gun at

ESSER GRAHAM
standing inside doorway with Cabbie Both unarmed

GRAHAM
We mean you no harm Mr Lorredo

MR HAPPY steps out of shadows where he’s been watching
Lorredo all along aiming gun at the back of Lorredo’s head

MR HAPPY
You’re not thinkin’ ya founda
Helen on your own are ya We led
you right to her All ya had to
do was follow a few bread crumbs

Lorredo spins around aims gun at Mr Happy A standoff

LORREDO
Who are you

GRAHAM
I believe people in your
profession refer to us as Joy Boys

Lorredo sizes them up
LORREDO

Didn’t think Joys were violent --
that they attacked or hurt people

CABBIE
(via voice box)
We don’t

LORREDO
No Then why did you attack
Nichols on the subway train

GRAHAM
Your friend Nichols was getting
too close to discovering our
whereabouts We had to intercede

HELEN
Both of you put down your guns

They don’t Lorredo turns to Helen in surprise

LORREDO
Are you with these people

HELEN
Yes

Lorredo reluctantly reholsters his gun Mr Happy does the
same still keeping a watchful eye on Lorredo’s every move

LORREDO
Why did you bring me here

Mr Happy shakes his head in disgust at Lorredo

MR HAPPY
You poor dumb bastard -- you
really have no idea what you’re up
against do you

HELEN
Come Ill explain everything

Helen and Lorredo start out Mr Happy steps in front of
them stopping them

MR HAPPY
We don’t even know yet if we can
trust this Sifter -- until we find
out if he’s with us or against us

HELEN
We don’t have much time He has to
be told now It’s our only chance

A beat Mr Happy nods steps aside allowing them to exit
INT ANOTHER ROOM

Helen leads Lorredo into smaller room Graham and Mr Happy
follow them as they approach two ancient paintings Dark
Macabre Forbidding The nightmarish work of a madman

HELEN
Man named Giotto painted them just
before the renaissance period

FIRST PAINTING

depicts the earth between heaven and hell and shows the
Prince of Darkness exchanging places on throne with God
Hideous demon-like creatures symbolic of the Damned arise

HELEN
He conceived them over a fifty
year period during which he was
driven insane by what he called
waking dreams of revelation

SECOND PAINTING
Aftermath Countless armies of DARK CRUSADERS wearing black
suits of armor some riding black horses charge out into the
world brandishing weapons like a scourge of black death
HELEN

According to Giotto’s prophecy

hell will send a Dark Messiah to

herald in the new Awakening
Helen hands Lorredo a photograph of ROBERT SKINNER

HELEN
This messiah is ROBERT SKINNER

Lorredo studies photo then looks back up at paintings

LORREDO
This Awakening has happened before

Graham steps forward

GRAHAM
Every one thousand years an
attempt is made to start the
Awakening But each time that
attempt was defeated

LORREDO
So how does this involve me

Graham Mr Happy and Cabbie refer that question to Helen

HELEN
We need your help to stop Skinner
from starting the Awakening

LORREDO
There’s nothing I can do to help

GRAHAM
Unless Skinner is expired before
midnight tomorrow -- all of
humanity will suffer an age of
darkness for the next millenniun

LORREDO
(to Helen)
Why did you wait until now to tell
me about this

GRAHAM
We are forbidden to interfere
You must find your own way

MR HAPPY
That’s right Sifters have rules
to obey -- and Joys have theirs

GRAHAM
We can only provide guidance
Nothing more The choice
ultimately has to be made by you

LORREDO
If Skinner is doing what you say
then my Employers will send
someone to deal with him

GRAHAM
Your Employers want Skinner to
succeed That’s been their plan
all along -- and you’re their pawn

HELEN
It’s true Why else do you think
they sent you to kill me-- because
they knew I was a threat to them

Graham places old wooden box on table opens it to expose
THREE RELIGIOUS DAGGERS
SARDIS DAGGERS Ancient Graham removes one displays its
long twisted blade polished iron handle He offers it to
Lorredo
GRAHAM

You’re the only person who can get

close to Skinner He won’t suspect

an attack from one of their own

Lorredo turns away declining to accept Dagger

LORREDO
rT can’t
MR HAPPY
Told you didn’t I -- that a man

who took his own life would never
have the guts to help anybody

Lorredo turns back to Mr Happy locks eyes with him a beat
then turns and exits down dark hallway becoming a silhouette

MR HAPPY

Should’ve read the sign out front
before you came in here Sifter --
It said No Cowards Allowed

burns in front A tireless tiny flame burning through the
ages Engraved on stone is SALVATORE LORREDO 1894-1926
Died In The Line of Duty May He Rest In Peace Forever

HELEN
You were supposed to forget me

LORREDO
I could never forget you Helen
Even if I died a thousand times

Lorredo removes glove and holds hand over eternal flame

LORREDO
That’s why my Employers offered me
the pardon -- they were using my
own past against me to get to you

Flame begins to burn Lorredo’s hand He doesn’t care

HELEN
Sal there’s something else that
you need to know about us We
were chosen to be here right
now -- from the moment we met

Lorredo continues to hold his hand over flame It hurts him

LORREDO
But when you first got Sick
made the promise to take your
life -- to end your pain -- I
alone pulled that trigger Helen

Unable to tolerate pain -- Lorredo retracts hand Makes fist
ULPRS

HELEN
How could we have known back then
that the choices we made -- the

promises we kept were all just
Part of the plan for us to be here
right now It’s our second chance

Lorredo gets slowly to his feet carrying the weight of
eternity on his shoulders He replaces glove on burned hand

LORREDO
There are no second chances My
Employers made me an offer I
couldn’t refuse They gave me a
pardon to expire you But that
doesn’t matter now Because I’m
not going to finish my assignment

Lorredo’s beeper SOUNDS He looks at it with doom

LORREDO
I’ve got something I need to take
care of We better be getting back

Lorredo hangs up He turns to Helen standing beside him

HELEN
What will you do now

LORREDO
Tell them I failed to locate you
That’1l give you time to escape

HELEN
I‘m not leaving

LORREDO
You don’t have a choice This is
how it will happen They’1l senda
a Sifter to expire me first Then
that same Sifter will come for you

Fear passes over Helen’s face But she stays determined
USs

HELEN
Why don’t you help us stop Skinner

Lorredo hits the wall with his fist

LORREDO
Damnit Helen This is a lost
cause A fools parade You have
no idea of the kind of people
you’re dealing with Weve
already lost And there’s nothing
we could ever do to change that

HELEN
Yes there is Sal -- you have a
choice You just need to make it

LORREDO
It’s already been made for me

HELEN
No The man I knew before would
not go so easily into that dark
night without putting up a fight

LORREDO
Leave the city -- Godamn it
Helen -- I’m begging you
Helen shakes her head No She locks eyes with him

HELEN
We both have our obligations

LORREDO
So I guess this is good-bye then

Helen looks away fighting back tears

HELEN
I wish you’d change your mind

LORREDO
I’m sorry Helen But I can’t
No matter what you say there’s no
choice for me Not now Not ever

Lorredo turns and walks off down hallway Helen follows

INT FRONT ENTRANCE
Lorredo stops at door Helen reaches him
LORREDO
If I had it to do over again
Helen -- if I could change the way
things turned out for us --
Helen puts her hand to Lorredo’s mouth Silencing him

You’d keep your promise again

Helen lowers her hand from Lorredo’s mouth He turns and
exits into the cold wind He looks back to her one last time

LORREDO
Here’s the status I want off this
assignment -- get somebody else
DOGHEAD

You know the rules Lorredo Once
you choose to accept an

assignment there’s no going back
Either you finish it or you burn

Lorredo grabs side of chicken wire shaking it furiously

LORREDO
You knew the real reason why The
Company offered me that pardon to
do this assignment Didn’t you

Doghead smirks

DOGHEAD
And what reason might that be
LORREDO
Don’t play stupid with me you
dumb sonuva-bitch -- you knew
DOGHEAD
We must all be held accountable
for our actions -- you alone must

understand that better than most

Lorredo flies into a rage -- knocking over everything

Doghead laughs at Lorredo’s pathetic display of emotion

Lorredo stops approaches cage and stares in at Doghead

DOGHEAD
The strength of your convictions
has always been your downfall
Lorredo Why should this life be
any different for you Accept it

Lorredo starts out

LORREDO
If I can’t get out of doing the

Lorredo exits

INT LORREDO’S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Dark Drapes closed Bed unmade Lorredo looks like shit
He sits in a chair in the middle of the room Cool Calm
He smokes a cigarette Drinks from his flask He waits

FOOTSTEPS approach outside Lorredo hears them and remains
seated Resigned to his fate A key fits into the lock The
door slowly opens a SHADOWY FIGURE stands in entry

SHADOWY FIGURE cautiously steps into room We’ll call him a
SIFTER because that’s what he is -- death carrying his weapon
of choice -- a sawed-off twin barrel 12- gauge shotgun that
he now brings out from his black over coat We never see
Sifter’s face His identity only his menacining presence

SIFTER
I’ve been sent by The Company

Lorredo nods expectantly not looking up He smokes cigarette

LORREDO
I’ve been expecting you

Sifter turns head -- sees Lorredo’s gun is inside holster
resting over back of a chair safely out of Lorredo’s reach

Sifter enters stops before Lorredo hunched forward resting
elbows on his knees staring at floor resigned to his fate

SIFTER
You should’ve completed your
assignment After this they may
never allow you to come back

Lorredo smokes cigarette Drinks from flask A condemned
man fulfilling his last request before his own execution

LORREDO
Just get it over with

SIFTER
After I’m finished here I’1l be
paying your lady friend a visit
Lorredo keeps silent staring down at floor into darkness

SIFTER
Any last requests
UES

Lorredo sips from flask Takes a last drag on cigarette
drops it to floor extinguishes it with shoe And that’s
when Lorredo suddenly becomes aware again of that faint

RAINBOW BEAM OF LIGHT

penetrating through the darkness He looks over at that
seemingly far-away object glowing on Opposite wall He
squints at it and remembers -- it’s that fucking NIGHTLIGHT

ON NIGHTLIGHT
blazing out in this dark moment like a lighthouse beacon
Sifter raises shotgun taking point-blank aim at Lorredo

SIFTER
Guess that’s it then your mind’s
made up Pity

Lorredo focuses on rainbow beam of light as if feeding on
it That tiny spark of humanity of compassion deep inside
Lorredo now begins to swell inside him Tears fill his eyes

SIFTER
Such a terrible waste of talent

Lorredo looks over at his gun hopelessly out of reach And
in that last second before Sifter pulls trigger Lorredo does
something he never thought possible e i ind

BOOM Sifter FIRES -- just as Lorredo takes flight hurling
himself through the air to grab for his gun -- the Sifter’s
shotgun blast instead blows Lorredo’s wooden chair to bits

All the skills All the training That have made Lorredo
into the ultimate killing machine All these things Lorredo
now summons for the near-impossible task of reaching his gun

Sifter now realizes Lorredo’s intention and corrects his ain

Lorredo grabs his forty-five out of holster and mustering
every bit of his ability and reflex -- turns his body in mid-
flight with amazing agility to fire off one shot at Sifter

LORREDO’S BULLET blows out Sifter’s left kneecap Blood

Spurts Sifter falls to his knees as he FIRES another blast
from his shotgun that misses Lorredo and blows a hole in the
mirrored ceiling sending down a shower of reflecting glass

Lorredo touches down rolls onto his side and FIRES a
second dead-aimed shot -- that hits Sifter square in chest
folding him over backwards his knees still bent under hin
Then it’s over No more gunfire All is silent A thin
layer of gun and cigarette smoke hangs in the air Lorredo
walks over to Sifter lying on his back in a puddle of blood

Sifter’s face remains in shadow except for the rainbow beam
that reveals his eyes that now register one big question mark

SIFTER
Why

LORREDO
I changed my mind

Blood gurgles in Sifter’s throat as he strains to speak

SIFTER
You’re going to burn for this

Lorredo stares deadpan down at Sifter A long beat

LORREDO
Probably so

BLAM -- Lorredo shoots Sifter dead Blackness
INT GUIDING LIGHT CAFETERIA - DAY

Homeless people sit at tables eating food Others stand in
the serving line receiving a bowl of soup from Mr Happy

Without warning Three Disciples burst through side emergency
exit door and open fire with assault rifles Chaos erupts as
Homeless scatter in all directions A few are hit by bullets
Mr Happy ducks out of kitchen anda runs down hallway

MORE DISCIPLES

crash down through skylights Glass pours Disciples land
on carpet and chase after Mr Happy down hallway

Helen and Graham help Mr Happy barricade door with table

MR HAPPY
Skinner has found us

Disciple continue to pound slowly pushing door open

MR HAPPY
There’s too many of them -- we’ll
have to evacuate

Graham grabs up the box containing the three Sardis Daggers

HELEN
They’ve probably got all exits
surrounded we’ll have to get out
through the basement

Helen Graham and Mr Happy start toward rear hallway door
that leads to stairwell As they do Disciples break through
barricaded door and rush into room behind then

MR HAPPY
Go -- I’1l hold them off

Helen and Graham proceed down stairwell Mr Happy closes
door and wraps an electrical cord around handle tying if off

INT BASEMENT LEVEL

Helen exits door only to encounter more Disciples Graham
and Helen are forced to separate in order to make an escape

INT BASEMENT LEVEL HALLWAY

Dark Helen proceeds alone She freezes in her tracks as
she sees somebody approaching her in the darkness

HELEN
Graham

AS person nears we see that it’s not Graham but a Disciple
And he’s holding a gun on her Helen backs away Skinner
steps into view behind her accompanied by two more Disciples

The moment Helen sees Skinner she grabs for the closest
Disciple’s rifle wrestling away from him Before she can
point it at Skinner she finds two rifles pointed at her head

SKINNER
Not a chance You’d be dead
before you could pull the trigger
And that would defeat your purpose

Helen surrenders rifle Skinner steps up to her smiles with
indignation Helen stares wrathfully at him Her eyes burn

SKINNER
It’s over for you Youve lost

Helen is trapped No way out She stands solid determined
strong to the last Facing death with tough-minded courage

HELEN
You’ll get yours Skinner

Disciple squeezes back on trigger BLAM Disciple falls
dead Skinner looks on in puzzlement as we see

LORREDO
appearing out of darkness running toward him at top speed

SKINNER
Kill him

Second Disciple and Lorredo Open fire on each other at the
Same time Disciple takes two hits in chest and drops dead
Lorredo reaches Helen and stops Helen smiles at hin

HELEN
I knew you’d come back

Third Disciple shoves rifle muzzle against Lorredo’s head

DISCIPLE
You’re finished

Disciple takes away Lorredo’s gun Skinner steps up to
Lorredo Both of them lock eyes with each other

SKINNER
I’m disappointed in you Lorredo

Lorredo looks at Skinner with surprise

LORREDO
How did you --

SKINNER
I read your profile

Skinner examines Lorredo’s forty-five

SKINNER
And if I’m not mistaken I believe
this is the gun you used to take
the life your your loving wife

Skinner gently touches Helen’s face She pulls back
Lorredo moves toward Skinner but Disciple restrains him

SKINNER
But I’m a fair man 111 give you
a choice Who wants to die first

Skinner hands Lorredo’s forty-five to Disciple He cocks Sa
Then aims gun first at Helen then at Lorredo Back and forth

LORREDO
Kill me first

HELEN
Don’t do it Sal -- please

Three more Disciples approach them down hallway

SKINNER
You heard the man

Lorredo doesn’t even flinch as Disciple squeezes back on
trigger CLICK Empty Disciple’s jaw drops in puzzlement

LORREDO
Never keep a round in the chamber

Lorredo grabs back his gun -- shoots Disciple dead
LORREDO
Because once you pull the trigger
it’s too late to change your mind

Approaching three Disciples raise their rifles As Lorredo
pushes Helen out of line of fire and spins to shoot Skinner --

Skinner grabs one of the approaching Disciples and uses him
as a shield -- just as Lorredo fires -- BLAM Disciple takes
hit in chest Skinner drops him and disappears around corner

Lorredo fires on two advancing Disciple taking them out

LORREDO
Is there a back door to this place
Helen nods They proceed off down hallway

Lorredo against a solid object and grabbing Helen away

LORREDO

shakes stars from his brain regains his senses looking up
at solid object that he hit to see that it’s in fact

A CARVED ICE STATUE OF ANGELS

One of them is MICHAEL brandishing a long ICE SWORD

Three Disciples attack Lorredo as he stumbles to his feet
trying to get his head together to continue the fight His
attention locked on one single object -- getting that sword
Disciples converge on Lorredo punching and kicking the shit
out of him Lorredo summons all his strength to pull on ice
sword It won’t budge Disciples continue punching him
Until

ICE SWORD

crumbles and breaks free from ice statue Michael’s hand
LORREDO

thrusts blade under his left arm -- impaling Disciple
standing directly behind him He retracts sword and spins

around with his new weapon Ready willing and able to fight
them It may be only ice but the blade is still razor sharp

LORREDO
Start prayin’

Lorredo uses both hands as he swings slippery ice sword at
remaining Disciple who lunges at Lorredo with a knife
THWACK -- Disciple falls dead with his chest spurting blood
HELEN
fighting and punching holding her own against Disciples

ICE SWORD

comes down hard on back of one Disciple’s head -- he bites
cold steel between his teeth as he collapses over dead

LORREDO

kills another Disciple But there’s just too many Lorredo
grabs Helen and they run off with Disciples in hot pursuit

DISCIPLES
converge on them from all sides Pandemonium People are
everywhere getting in their way interfering with Lorredo
and Helen’s escape There’s no way to outrun Disciples
ELYSIAN CAB
skids to a stop in front of Lorredo and Helen

Lorredo double-takes smirks upon recognizing Cabbie

LORREDO
Nice to see a friendly face

Lorredo and Helen jump into cab Cab speeds off making an
escape just as Disciples converge on the area

CABBIE

INT ELMO’S VIDEOS - NIGHT
Skinner pounds on counter in rage

SKINNER
You assured me Lorredo would not
interfere

Doghead calmly sits back in wheelchair

DOGHEAD
We took every precaution -- even
offered him a pardon Evidently
Lorredo must’ve changed his mind

SKINNER
The wheels of this operation have
been turning longer than you could
possibly imagine -- and I will not
fail now because some Sifter had
a change of heart Is that clear

DOGHEAD
You have my sympathies We’1l send
somebody to rectify the problem

SKINNER
No You’ve already failed to stop
him I’11 deal with him myself

Okay

Frank unlatches chain opens door They enter

LORREDO
We need a place to hold up

Frank wears bathrobe and slippers He lets out a raspy COUGH

FRANK
Mi casa tu casa

He stares curiously at Helen strangely captivated by her
FRANK
Have we met I can’t place the
face -- but the eyes look familiar
Frank looks to Lorredo for the answer

LORREDO
A long time ago Frank

Frank exits kitchen carrying serving tray with two cups and
a decanter He sets it on table and begins pouring coffee

LORREDO
I need you to help me find
something in the archive

FRANK
What in particular

Lorredo takes out folded up copy of Kern Symbol that Landlord
gave to him and holds it up Frank squints to see taking it

LORREDO
Ever see this before

Frank continues to study symbol His face becomes serious

FRANK
Some things are best forgotten

Lorredo proceeds down hall opens far door and switches on
light to illuminate

THE ARCHIVE ROOM

Helen enters Photos and other memorabilia Several stacks
of old newspapers Piles of old documents A time capsule

HELEN
What is this place

Lorredo runs his hand along the smooth hard surface of
IRON SALLY

a relic from prohibition days This steel reinforced rig
resembles an armored car with V-shaped battering ram

LORREDO
Good ole’ Iron Sally A real ball-
breaker Wonder if she still runs
Helen inspects wall-mounted display of period-piece guns used
during early part of century Mannequin wears old-fashioned
BULLET-PROOF VEST with a ammo belt of old-fashioned GRENADES

LORREDO
Where I spend my off-time

Helen moves to glass display case Inside she finds

FIVE TARNISHED PINKERTON BADGES

with old photo showing Lorredo with four other Pinkerton Men
mugging for the camera Having the time of their lives One
of the men is a much younger version of Frank Angeline

HELEN
You can’t forget the past can you

Lorredo mournfully shakes his head No

LORREDO
It’s the only thing I have left

INT BATHROOM

Lorredo flicks on light removes coat and shirt exposing his
badly bruised chest caused by being kicked by Disciples

Helen enters to find him trying to wrap bandage around chest

HELEN
Here let me help you

LORREDO
I can do it

Pain causes Lorredo to drop bandage roll Helen retrieves it
and begins bandaging up Lorredo

HELEN
You might need a doctor to look at
this

LORREDO

Doctors can’t heal what I’ve got
Helen ties off bandage like a trained professional

HELEN
There That ought to hold

LORREDO
Once a nurse Always a nurse

Lorredo slowly puts on shirt wincing from pain Helen
touches his chest He pulls away suddenly uncomfortable

LORREDO
Don’t

HELEN
What’s wrong

Lorredo rubs his ever-tired eyes sighing heavily trying to
relieve the aching burning feeling building inside of hin

LORREDO
Nothing’s wrong Just don’t

HELEN
You’re not attracted to me

Lorredo locks eyes with Helen

LORREDO
Of course I’m attracted to you

Helen steps closer to Lorredo Lorredo takes a step back

HELEN
Then touch me

He hesitantly reaches out to Helen his fingers touch her
skin -- he instantly pulls back like he’d burned his hand

LORREDO
I c-can’t

Lorredo puts on his leather gloves and then looks down
mournfully a man beaten Lost

HELEN
You must be able to feel something

She reaches out touching his face He doesn’t react Just
sits there expressionless a mannequin in a store window

LORREDO
Nothing Not anymore

HELEN
Close your eyes

He does Helen disrobes letting her dress fall to ground
She steps out of it takes Lorredo’s hand and removes his
glove and then delicately places his hand on her chest

HELEN
What do you feel now

Lorredo trembles as if having withdrawals Something hurts

deep inside him Something he hasn’t felt for a long time

They move closer Both craving Their lips slowly touch
igniting the eternal fire burning between then

Jukebox plays vintage tune In front of three half-eaten
plates of food sits Lorredo dragging on cigarette He
exhales recycling smoke back through nose He picks up
CUP OF COFFEE

closes his eyes as he breathes in aroma He sips it
Sloshing it around like mouthwash swallows it -- Mmm good

LORREDO
Damn good cuppa joe

Lorredo sips his joe again Closes his eyes Smiles with joy

LORREDO
Best I’ve ever had

Helen sits across table watching Lorredo smiling as she
views the transformation taking place inside Lorredo
Lorredo looks up aware of Helen watching him

HELEN
First time I’ve seen you smile

He sips more coffee In heaven He takes another drag on
cigarette examining it curiously perhaps to locate the
source of the miraculous pleasure that it’s providing him

LORREDO
Come with me

Lorredo reaches out gently touches Helen’s face feeling the
smoothness of her skin like a tailor feeling the finest silk

HELEN
To where

LORREDO
A special place

HELEN
Now It’s freezing outside

LORREDO
Now’s the best time

Helen takes Lorredo’s hand from her face kisses it
LORREDO
No matter how things turn out we
have this short time together
Let’s use every second of it
Helen strokes his cheek lovingly

HELEN
I’1ll get my coat

Helen exits up back stairs to Frank’s apartment Lorredo
drags on cigarette Graham slides into booth with him

GRAHAM
I’1l guarantee you without a
doubt -- you will never find

better Life Insurance than I am
heretofore about to offer thee

LORREDO
That’s the last thing I need now

Graham fastens rubber band around thumb and forefinger
making a makeshift gun He squints as he aims carefully at

A HOUSEFLY
perched atop half-eaten bagel cleaning its wings
Graham fires rubber band gun -- hitting housefly dead-on

GRAHAM
Let the punishment fit the crime

Lorredo watches curiously as Graham picks up fly inspects it
like a trophy inserts it into a matchbox with a dozen others

LORREDO
Make it quick We’re leaving

Graham opens cluttered briefcase takes out documents

GRAHAM
Now then sir Are you what they
call one of them habitual smokers

Lorredo blows smoke in Graham’s face He coughs

GRAHAM
That to me indicates a yes Any
history of excessive drinking

Lorredo takes a big swig from his flask sighs with ecstasy

GRAHAM
(checking box)
That to me indicates a yes

LORREDO
Tell me something Graham If
Skinner succeeds in starting the
Awakening what happens to Helen
ot

GRAHAM
You and Helen share the same fate

Lorredo freezes as he extinguishes his cigarette in ashtray
Evidently this is the last thing Lorredo expected to hear

LORREDO
Helen can’t return to Heaven

GRAHAM
None of us can If Skinner wins
there’s no hope for any of us
Lorredo tries to swallow the huge lump in his throat
LORREDO

Did Helen know about this -- I
mean was she told before she came

GRAHAM
Yes She was told But she chose
to come anyway To be with you
Lorredo is speechless Graham holds out contract and a pen

- GRAHAM
Now sign here If you please

Lorredo takes pen hesitating as he suspiciously eyes the
insurance document He then looks back at Graham

LORREDO
Life Insurance huh

GRAHAM
What else

Lorredo signs Helen approaching down the stairs

LORREDO
Helen and I want to be alone now

GRAHAM
Consider me gone my brother
Life is precious don’t waste it
Graham tears off copy hands a copy to Lorredo

GRAHAM
Take care Lorredo

Graham extends his hand to Lorredo Lorredo shakes it

LORREDO

Oh I’ve still got some unfinished
business I need to take care of
Graham taps the Life Insurance policy in Lorredo’s hand

EXT WATERFRONT - NIGHT

Alone in the darkness Lorredo and Helen huddle together
keeping each other warm staring out at the sparkling
reflection of skyscraper lights dancing on the water

ON WATER

a thousand pieces of light Brilliant and radiant
Shimmering off the pitch-black impenetrable depths

HELEN
It’s beautiful Like diamonds

They stand in silence mesmerized Lorredo turns to Helen

LORREDO
Regardless of the outcome of all
this -- whatever happens to us
Helen I’ve got no regrets

HELEN
Neither do I

A dark figure approaches behind them on instinct Lorredo
reaches for his forty-five But it’s Mr Happy who appears

MR HAPPY
Serenade for a dollar

Lorredo relaxes holds out a dollar to Mr Happy Mr Happy
takes it and begins snapping his fingers singing a slow tune

Lorredo and Helen embrace and begin to dance And for that
dollar they buy themselves a moment of happiness together

HELEN
What we’ve got can’t be taken away

As they turn we see that they are both holding back tears
their expressions reflecting the fear of losing each other

LORREDO
Maybe in another life a different
place we’ll find each other again

Helen nods embraces him tighter not wanting to let him go

LORREDO
They can’t take it away

They hold each other tighter now as if some invisible force
were trying to pull them apart

LORREDO
I won’t let them Helen

They look at each other Trembling in each other’s arms

LORREDO
I’1l never let them

This kiss passionately as if this were the last kiss they
would ever share Mr Happy sings on in the cold night

INT ARCHIVE ROOM - DAY

Lorredo Helen Frank look through numerous piles of old
yellowed and tattered newspapers from the 1920’s and 30’s

LORREDO
Must be here someplace

FRANK
Over here think I found it

Across the room Frank holds up a stack of old yellowed
tattered newspapers Lorredo and Helen approach Lorredo
takes them and places each one side-by-side on a table

LORREDO
In 1922 there were a series
murders committed in this city
All the victims were killed the
same peculiar ritualistic way

The succession of front page headlines detail several
mysterious murders accompanied by not-so-pretty black and
white photographs of the grisly murdered victims

LORREDO
It was determined during the
investigation that these slayings
were actually ritualistic
sacrifices Devil worshiper stuff

Lorredo plops down the last newspaper that has a close-up
photo showing the branded kern symbol on one of the victims
He matches it with copy of symbol given to him by Landlord

LORREDO
Each victim had this same symbol
branded on them Recognize it

Helen looks at it and nods in shock Frank also looks at it

FRANK
I remember After looking into
it --- we discovered that these

same type of homicides had been
occurring all over the entire
world for the past several
centuries

Frank goes to closet across the room and searches through it
pulling out an old 16mm reel-in-case He approaches with it

FRANK
I think you need to see this

INT ARCHIVE ROOM -- 10 MINUTES LATER

Lorredo Helen and Frank view an old bw 16mm film projected
onto a tiny screen at the front of the archive room

IMAGE ON SCREEN

we see the Pinkerton Detectives wearing their trademark
suits as they The camera is hand-held and therefore jerky
They are storm-trooping a large commune in the country
outside the city Pinkertons break down the doors to the
main facility and rush inside to round up all the inhabitants

FRANK
They were called the Devil’s
Brigade -- they made the Manson
family look like the Waltons

IMAGE ON SCREEN

Different footage taken at a later date showing Pinkertons
and several uniformed policemen gathering up more Disciples

FRANK
Evidently this Brigade had
secretly existed for nearly a
thousand years spread out over
different parts of Europe And
they’d all migrated to the states
at the beginning of the 1900’s

LORREDO
I recall they planned to release
nerve gas into the subway

FRANK
They almost succeeded too -- if
we hadn’t located the plant where
they were manufacturing the gas

IMAGE ON SCREEN

More Pinkertons with rifles poised and baseball bats burst
into manufacturing warehouse and discharge tear gas canisters
into crowd of Disciples who scatter in every direction

Lorredo pays special attention to particular warehouse where
Disciples are placed inside police transport vehicles outside

FRANK
Ten years later we finally
apprehended the leader of the
Devil’s Brigade Right here --

Frank hands Lorredo newspaper A photo shows a menacing man
being led away in cuffs by Pinkertons Frank is with them

FRANK 2

His name was Robert Skinner
HELEN

My God
FRANK

He was convicted of murder for the
human sacrifices and sentenced to
death He got the gas in ’38

Lorredo is unable to take his eyes off of Skinner’s photo --
a face that seems to be staring straight out at him Film
ends Frank switches off projector Room goes dark

HELEN
What became of the Devil’s Brigade

FRANK
They disappeared Rumor has it
that they were in the old subway
tunnels But we never found then
We just presumed they disbanded

Frank switches on light
FRANK
I guess we were wrong They’ve
been hiding their victims in the
subway tunnels all these years
LORREDO
And it looks like Skinner came
back to finish the job he started
Lorredo picks up another newspaper that has a follow-up story

on the front page about the Pinkerton’s raid on the
warehouse Headline reads Devil’s Nerve Gas Plant Raided

LORREDO
This warehouse still exist

FRANK
Yes I believe it does -- on old
Pier 58 But the facility itself
was dismantled You don’t think --

LORREDO
I don’t know It’s just a hunch

Lorredo stares back at newspaper front page photo Thinking
ANGLE ON BW PHOTO OF WAREHOUSE

as actual warehouse slowly superimposes over photo

Even more dreary looking and dirty than it looked in the old
photo Abandoned Dark Gloomy Soot coats the windows

Graham approaches cautiously and enters through a side door

INT WAREHOUSE

Graham draws out one of the SACRED DAGGERS and proceeds down
the dark hallway All is quiet Nothing stirs Graham’s
footsteps echo-off into the blackness as he advances deeper

Suddenly lights come on -- blinding Graham who shields his
eyes Before him Skinner approaches out of the brightness
and stops twenty feet in front of him He crosses his arms

SKINNER
They say never shoot the messenger
who delivers you bad news But in
your case I’1l make an exception

Several dark silhouettes close in around Graham surrounding
him You can’t readily see who they are but you know
they’re Disciples Graham knows he’s outnumbered He raises
dagger and charges Skinner yelling at the top of his lungs

Less than ten feet before Graham reaches Skinner -- Skinner
raises a gun into view and shoots Graham repeatedly Dead

Skinner kneels beside Graham’s lifeless body and retrieves
the Sacred Dagger prying it loose from Graham’s iron grip

SKINNER
Only two daggers left

crime scene Phaelon pours through a stack of homicide
files Fancy enters carrying a computer printout

FANCY
Got back the info on Lorredo’s
ID search you wanted-- you’re
not going to believe this

Phaelon tosses down a file in frustration rubs his tired
eyes

PHAELON
Right now I’m ready to believe my
own grandma did these killings

FANCY
Apparently there was a Sal Lorredo
working at the Pinkerton Detective
Agency

Phaelon gets up and empties the last of the pot of coffee
into his mug

PHAELON
Okay -- so

Phaelon dumps a ton of sugar into his stale coffee sips it

FANCY
So the guy’s been dead since 1926

Phaelon pours the coffee down the front of himself

PHAELON
What are you talkin’ about

Phaelon grabs data sheet reads it over look at Lorredo’s
black and white photo taken of him back in 1926 wearing his
Pinkerton Badge and uniform Phaelon looks up confused

PHAELON

INT FRANK’S HOUSE

Helen converses with Mr Happy We don’t hear them but
judging by their sorrowful faces it must be bad news After
a beat Mr Happy turns as exits back through front door
Lorredo approaches Helen

LORREDO
What’s wrong

HELEN
Graham’s dead

LORREDO
Skinner still alive

HELEN
Yes

Helen sighs mournfully nearly fainting Lorredo grabs her

LORREDO
When was the last time you rested

HELEN
I can’t rest until this is over

Helen nearly faints again Lorredo picks her up in his arms
and carries her down hallway toward one of the back bedrooms

Lorredo strokes Helen’s hair She sleeps peacefully Like
an angel He traces his index finger around her lips making
the shape of a ghost smile Still sound asleep she smiles
INT FRANK’S KITCHEN
Now fully clothed wearing his trademark black overcoat
Lorredo pauses to peer in on Frank who looks ancient frail
extinct as he sleeps in chair beside percolating coffee pot

LORREDO
Look after her Frank

Lorredo switches off the light putting shadows into the
kitchen then exits out the front door into the cold night

EXT OLD PIER NEAR SKINNER‘S WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Ships are at their moorings A foghorn SOUNDS in harbor

INT OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

Lorredo enters with caution Candles burn Lorredo makes
his way through the darkness Something moves out of the
corner of his eye --

A DISCIPLE

charges out of darkness candlelight briefly illuminates his
insane expression as he lunges at Lorredo with large knife

Lorredo turns and FIRES -- killing Disciple
ANOTHER DISCIPLE

comes at Lorredo from the other side and tackles Lorredo
They struggle Lorredo grabs him and snaps his neck

Lights come on and flood warehouse with brightness The
place is empty Cleaned out Only item here is a table on
which sits a laptop computer Screen flickers to life

ON COMPUTER SCREEN

Skinner’s face appears transmitted via remote video link

SKINNER
We meet again Mr Lorredo Nice
of you stop in for a visit

Lorredo approaches table

SKINNER
But you’re too late my
Disciples have already vacated

LORREDO
I’m going to hunt you down
Skinner You can’t hide from me

SKINNER
They say there’s a moment in every
person’s life that defines who
they are and the life they’ve
lived Do you know when that is

LORREDO
I never cared to think about it

SKINNER
Ironically it’s the point just
before death They say our own
lives flash before our eyes

LORREDO
Too bad

SKINNER
Why is that bad

LORREDO
Not for everybody -- but for some
For the ones who have nothing good
to show for the life they’ve lived

Lorredo lights up a cigarette - Skinner sniffs at it in jest
as if he could actually smell smoke over the monitor

SKINNER
The smell of smoke always brings
with it such unpleasant memories

LORREDO
Why don’t you enlighten ne
Skinner Why start the Awakening

Lorredo looks at opposite wall where the name LUCIFER has
been painted The c has been turned into an sn —— and a
T has been inserted in middle spelling the word SIFTER

SKINNER
People tend to forget their
surroundings -- tune things out

Because they’re used to them
Bored with them It’s human
nature Until they’re deprived

LORREDO
Deprived

SKINNER
Yes And after that they gain
appreciation Look at it this
way -- without death life would
be meaningless

LORREDO
(sarcastic)
How profound And I Suppose the
Awakening is their wake-up call

SKINNER
Indeed it is Too bad you won’t
be around to see it happen Sifter

Skinner holds up what appears to be a miniature car alarm
Clicker He clicks it once It SQUAWKS causing

ALUMINUM SLATTED SECURITY SHUTTERS
to clamor down Closing off exits Lorredo is trapped

Skinner clicks clicker a second time It SQUAWKS twice A
winch engine comes to life lowering something down

SKINNER
You were a valuable resource to
The Company Lorredo -- it’s too
bad you chose to work against us

GRAHAM’S DEAD BODY

lowers into view hanging upside-down and then stops ten
feet about the table Strapped to Graham’s body are semtex
plastic explosives and a detonator with a digital readout

Skinner clicks clicker a third time It SQUAWKS three times
A DIGITAL READOUT
on Graham begins counting down 100 0059 00358

SKINNER
Give my regards to your Employers

Lorredo tries to raise shutters but they won’t budge He
POUNDS fists on them furiously then turns back to Skinner

LORREDO
I’1ll see you in hell

Skinner laughs

SKINNER
Have a nice trip

Lorredo fires his gun at computer screen -- blows it to bits
Lorredo throws off laptop slides table underneath Grahams
hanging body and climbs onto table to attempt to reach

Lorredo falls unconsciousness Sound FADES
INT HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Dark Lorredo lies unconscious in bed with various life-
Support tubes sticking out of his body His face is bruised
and battered A heart monitor BEEPS continuously nearby

A heavy-set dark figure stands at the foot of Lorredo’s bea
in profile Smoking a cigar Working a crossword puzzle

Lorredo opens his eyes and takes focus on this man in his
50’s wearing a tweed suit and tie Meet Lorredo’s EMPLOYER

CLOSE ON A CROSSWORD PUZZLE
being worked with a pencil Nearly complete

EMPLOYER
(to himself)
A double-bind situation in which
one factor invalidates or makes
impossible other factors One word

Employer pencils in the word CATCH 22 He then looks up
to see Lorredo very groggy but awake watching him

There’s something menacing about this Employer He seems to
look right through you A man of infinite patients -- like
he’s got an eternity to wait And doesn’t mind doing so

EMPLOYER
Allow me to introduce myself
Mister Lorredo I am your Employer

Lorredo says nothing He’s too weak Heart monitor BEEPS
EMPLOYER
You think there’s nothing worse we
could do to you -- that not even
a stay in one of our finer plague
resorts could’ve kept you from
defecting to the other side

Employer chuckles

EMPLOYER
I’m here to tell you that nothing
could be further from the truth
People still think in black and
white But the world has gotten
much more complicated than that

Employer puffs slowly enjoying his fine Cuban cigar

EMPLOYER
Archaic words like good and evil
no longer apply They’ve lost
their significance in a sea of
grays Personally I prefer ‘to
the term Checks and Balances

Employer leans close to Lorredo holding a cup with straw out
to Lorredo for him to drink Lorredo declines with a stern
shake of his head Employer shrugs setting down cup

EMPLOYER
Here’s a little bed-time story
You get no pardon No freedon
Basically you’re finished And
since you failed to Carry out your
assignment I will take from you
the only thing left that matters

Employer leans closer and whispers into Lorredo’s ear in the
coldest most menacing tone of voice you’ve ever heard

EMPLOYER
Your memory of ever loving Helen

A genuine look of fear crosses over Lorredo’s face

EMPLOYER
Imagine going through eternity
without that life preserver called
love keeping you from sinking in
the flames of damnation

Employer puts out cigar It singes

EMPLOYER
So aS you can see there are
far worse things that can happen
to you than simply having to wear
an albatross around your neck

Employer calmly folds up crossword puzzle and inserts it into
the breast pocket of Lorredo’s hospital pajamas Pats it

EMPLOYER
Enjoy the last few precious
minutes of freedom Mister Lorredo

Employer exits With a trembling hand Lorredo reaches over
and yanks out the wires and tubes hooked into him But
that’s about all he can manage before he falls unconscious

A menacing-looking NURSE enters with a tray of medication
She sets tray on bedside table and looks at Lorredo lying
unconscious She removes from tray a syringe And that’s
when we see that she has a KERN SYMBOL branded on her arn

As she goes to inject Lorredo Lorredo grabs her arn They
struggle Lorredo still very weak slowly forces needle
into Nurse injecting the poison into her She collapses to
the floor convulses for a few seconds then lies dead

EXT CITY SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Lorredo far past the point of exhaustion stumbles along
through driving snow Streets are empty The dark figures
of Two DISCIPLES appear like Shadowy ghosts behind hin
Lorredo turns shoots one Disciple but can’t get off another
shot before other Disciple punches hin knocking his gun out
of his hand Lorredo grabs Disciple ina strangle hold

A SNOWPLOW APPROACHES

its headlights cut through darkness like eyes of demons
LORREDO AND DISCIPLE

continue struggling Disciple punches him in side repeatedly

Lorredo grimaces but hangs on tight A moment later
Disciple stops fighting and lies still Lorredo releases

SNOWPLOW
comes straight at Lorredo through blinding snow

Lorredo clumsily gets to his feet fighting to stay
conscious Before he can move out of the path of Snowplow --

FIRST DISCIPLE

barely alive grabs Lorredo’s leg preventing him from
moving Lorredo stretches out to reach his gun lying only
inches out of his reach in the snow -- his fingers touch the
cold steel -- but he just can’t quite grab it with his hand
SNOWPLOW

head straight at them -- less than ten feet away from them
Certain death Lorredo is out of strength He’s going to die

MR HAPPY

pushes Lorredo out of -harm’s way just in nick of time
Snowplow hits Happy instead catapulting him away

SNOWPLOW

loses control collides into side of parked car -- EXPLODES
into fiery flying metal throwing Lorredo back down to ground

Lorredo crawls to Mr Happy lying in blood-soaked snow

MR HAPPY
You must hurry

With a trembling hand Mr Happy extends to Lorredo
THIRD SARDIS DAGGER
Lorredo takes it

MR HAPPY
It’s the only way to destroy him

Mr Happy dies
INT FRANK’S PLACE - NIGHT

Scrambled Bleeding from a cut in his forehead The Place
has been turned upside-down A battle has been waged here

IN ARCHIVE ROOM

Three Disciples lay dead Presumably shot down by Frank
CABBIE

lays dead with SECOND DAGGER protruding out of his chest

Frank moans nearby Lorredo locates Frank under fallen
cabinet lifts it away Frank’s badly wounded and dying

LORREDO

(shaking him)
Frank where’s Helen

Frank looks up trying to focus on Lorredo He coughs
FRANK
Tried to stop them Sal --
(coughs )

T-tried real hard
Frank lapses coughing clinging to his last moments of life

LORREDO
You did good Frank -- real good
Tell me What happened to Helen

FRANK
They took her

Frank opens his clenched hand where he holds an old map of
the subway tunnels He holds it up to Lorredo

FRANK
I found ’em Sal -- they’re in the
tunnels I knew it all along

Lorredo takes map from Frank and looks at it Frank’s eyes
take focus on Lorredo one last time as the light behind them
slowly dims He smiles

FRANK
Had good times didn’t we Sal

LORREDO
God knows we did Frank Plenty

Frank lets out a final sigh then dies His body goes
lifeless Lorredo closes his eyes laying him to rest

LORREDO
You get some rest now Frank

Lorredo stands And we see a transformation take place
within him -- a fire like none other igniting in his eyes

SERIES OF SHOTS

Lorredo straps on gear puts on bullet-proof vest then long
belts holding ammo and grenades He removes special issue 12
gauge SHOTGUN a gun made to stop tanks and attaches to it
a reloading canister He cocks it -- Ka-Chunk

Lorredo douses place with gasoline then takes out his butane
lighter flicks the flame ignites fuel -- KA-WHOOSH

Finally the shooting stops as Lorredo’s rifle clicks empty
Pitch-blackness Unseen wounded and dying Disciples moan

Lorredo stands traumatized shell-shocked He looks down at
himself to see that his entire left arm is soaked in blood
from where a bullet passed through his shoulder

Dead Disciples are strewn across floor Others moan
LORREDO

approaches Skinner a silhouetted figure kneeling in front of
a dead Disciple closing his eyes laying him to rest

LORREDO
You better pray she’s unharmed

Skinner stands to confront Lorredo He steps away from
burning Iron Sally wreckage into view approaching Lorredo

SKINNER
Back from the dead I see

LORREDO
That’s far enough Skinner

Skinner halts remaining calm defiant He shrugs crossing
his hands patiently behind his back Waiting

SKINNER
Ever notice how a wasp after you
smother it to death in a killing
jar -- just keeps on buzzing for
hours hours Sal Know why

Lorredo scornfully shakes his head eyes filling with rage

SKINNER
Because that stupid bug doesn’t
have sense enough to know when to
call it quits That’s you Sal

LORREDO
You and this insane crusade of
yours is finished Skinner over

Skinner looks around at his dead and dying Disciples sighs
then stares back at the fire losing himself in the flames

SKINNER
We all need to make sacrifices

Skinner strolls closer to burning Iron Sally wreckage
carefully stepping over his dead Disciples lying everywhere

LORREDO
Either you tell me where she is
or I’1l kill you where you stand
LTS s

A thick black cloud of smoke sweeps over Skinner
transforming him into a shadowy ghost

SKINNER
Like I said before without
death life would be meaningless

As smoke lifts Lorredo discovers that Skinner is missing
Lorredo steps forward aiming rifle as he hunts for him

SKINNER (0S)
Of course by the time we come to
that realization -- it’s too late

Lorredo inches up alongside burning Iron Sally -- Skinner
voice stronger and closer now He’s close Very close

LORREDO
And I suppose they offered you a
pardon for your role in all this
Skinner laughs heartily still hidden in surrounding smoke

SKINNER
More than that -- much much more

Skinner steps out into view aiming rifle at Lorredo’s back
SKINNER
Pity only one of us will be
collecting our little prizes

LORREDO
Ain’t that the truth

Without turning Lorredo covertly pulls pin on grenade and
tosses it over his shoulder at Skinner then dives for cover

GRENADE

lands at Skinner’s feet He freezes with fear as he looks
down at it Moments tick nothing happens No explosion

Skinner’s terrified expression becomes a laugh of amusement
He stoops retrieves grenade inspects it Then shrugs

SKINNER
Don’t make ‘em like they used to

Lorredo steps out into the open aiming at Skinner

LORREDO
Told you I’d hunt you down
There’s a bounty on your head
Skinner I’m here to collect it

Two wounded Disciples surprise Lorredo from behind with
rifles aimed at his head He surrenders raising his hands

SKINNER
Words to live by or rather die
by Am I right about that Sal

Skinner approaches Lorredo taking away his forty-five
looking at it then aiming it directly at Lorredo cocking it

SKINNER
So predictable Your Employers
dangled hope in front of you like
a carrot in front of a horse

Lorredo grimaces with hate as he locks eyes with Skinner

LORREDO
What are you waiting for
asshole send me to hell

SKINNER
What for You’ll send yourself
there soon enough Bring hin

Skinner proceeds off down a small corridor leading to another
area Disciples follow Skinner keeping Lorredo at gunpoint

CEREMONIAL ROOM

A menacing spacious room dominated by a large alter table in
the center the contents of which can not yet be seen This

part of the old subway tunnel as undergone a transformation

Gothic fixtures Industrial steel walls A place of worship

SKINNER
The moment of truth has arrived

Several spotlights switch on from high above -- their bright
beams crisscrossing down through blackness to illuminate

HELEN

with her arms and legs tied to alter table Her eyes dart
around in fear as she looks at both Skinner and Lorredo
Lv
Skinner strokes her hair puts his face close to hers sniffs
with glee as if smelling the sweet aroma of her perfume

SKINNER
She’s mine now

Lorredo filled with rage steps toward Skinner only to have
one of the Disciples rifle-butt hin sending him to his knees

LORREDO ON KNEES

eyes his forty-five that Skinner holds in his hand He
concentrates thinks hard he’s got to get that gun

SKINNER
Almost midnight An end of a
millennium and the beginning of
a new Awakening
SIX DISCIPLES

wearing ceremonial gowns approach Helen out of the
surrounding shadows drawing out their sacrificial KNIVES

LORREDO
Not quite

From a kneeling position Lorredo sprints toward Skinner
SKINNER

sees Lorredo coming and calmly almost as if toying with
him aims at him and pulls trigger CLICK Empty chamber

Shock fills Skinner’s face That precious second is all
Lorredo needed to reach Skinner and grab back his gun

LORREDO
Never keep a round in the chamber

Lorredo smacks Skinner in face with gun
LORREDO
Because once you pull the trigger
it’s too late to change your mind
Lorredo aims to kill Skinner Skinner grins defiantly

SKINNER
You’re too late to save her

Helen cries out Lorredo looks over at her to see the SIx
DISCIPLES converging on her raising the sacrificial knives

SKINNER
Five bullets left and six
Disciples what will you do
LORREDO

hesitates then takes dead-aim on Helen with his forty-five
Tears well in his eyes

LORREDO
I’d rather she die by my hand
then by yours
Lorredo and Helen locks eyes
LORREDO
(to Helen)
Forgive me for what I must now do
LORREDO’S FINGERS

squeeze back on trigger BLAM Blast echoes like thunder
And the deed is done

Lorredo holds the six Disciples at gunpoint as he goes to
Helen freeing her arms legs embracing her lifeless body

LORREDO
I had no other choice

Lorredo buries his head beside her A man lost Again
HELEN

opens her eyes a look of understanding on her face as she
touches Lorredo’s face then whispers her last dying breath

HELEN
Forget about me

Helen goes lifeless She dies Lorredo holds her tight
trembling now as tears begin to well inside his burning eyes

Silence is broken when Skinner starts to LAUGH applauding
SKINNER

You must realize now Sal -- that
the irony here staggers the mind

The realization hits Lorredo Without looking up from Helen
Lorredo speaks out with his tired nearly inaudible voice

LORREDO
So where does that leave us

SKINNER

There’s one item of business that

still needs to happen before The

Awakening can actually begin
Lorredo lays Helen down strokes her hair one last time
Then with an expression of overwhelming grief and grim
determination puts forty-five to his head cocks trigger
Skinner opens a metal case and removes the
SEAL OF GETHSEMANE
Skinner grasps Seal with both hands twists -- severing it

SKINNER
The Awakening now begins

Lorredo turns his forty-five aiming instead at Skinner

LORREDO
Not quite

Lorredo’s eyes narrow as he pulls back on trigger -- BLAM
Skinner takes bullet stumbles backward locking eyes with
Lorredo one last time then falls over dead onto his back
His deep eyes reflecting the surrounding growing flames

LORREDO
Now it is time

THE FLAMES

climb walls spreading across ceiling consuming everything
Giant fiery pieces of this burning house of cards rain down

Lorredo outlines Helen’s lips with his fingers

LORREDO
It wasn’t supposed to end this way

Lorredo picks up Helen and Carries her away in his arms
Flames cut off all exits Lorredo and Helen approach

BURNING WALL OF FLAMES
BOTH OF THEM
becoming silhouettes as they approach

Lorredo halts before the fiery furnace a moment before
entering -- radiating heat outlines their bodies nimbus-like

LORREDO
Only death awaits us now

Lorredo starts into flames but then halts as the deafening
SOUND of grinding metal is heard Lorredo turns to see

PART OF CATWALK

CRASH down forming a sideways V-shape -- the front part
touching ground at a 45-degree angle with rest of structure
that extends over the flames like a drawbridge to safety

Lorredo climbs onto catwalk carrying Helen inching across
it using the twisted railing to balance himself The
structure grinds shifting down a few feet under his weight

AT OTHER END OF CATWALK

Skinner steps into view He stands in the thick clouds of
rising smoke unhurt as if his wound had miraculously healed

SKINNER
(calling out)
You’1l never make it out alive

Lorredo halts looking ahead at Skinner He frowns
perplexed by the fact that he’s still somehow alive

LORREDO
Neither will you

Lorredo climbs back down catwalk lowers Helen to ground
retrieves two assault rifles from two dead Disciples lying
nearby He checks the action on both slinging them on his
shoulder as he climbs back onto catwalk to confront Skinner
AT OTHER END OF CATWALK

Skinner stands ready for attack

LORREDO
I’m sending you back to hell
Ls

LORREDO

yells out in rage as Charges toward Skinner
SKINNER

screams out as he sprints toward Lorredo
BOTH LORREDO AND SKINNER

open fire simultaneously moving at top speed toward each
other -- exploding into blaze of gunfire and flying bullets

HAIL OF BULLETS
fly in both directions -- ricocheting off catwalk and walls
SKINNER

gets hit first -- bullet penetrates his right shoulder Blood
spurts He keeps running

LORREDO

gets turned sideways as bullet passes through left arm But
he keeps coming -- his rage and fury giving him strength

Just before they collide in a frenzy of gunfire
CATWALK

gives way -- splitting in-half as front part pulls free of
wall supports and clamors down in ROAR of grinding metal

LORREDO

is thrown backward sliding down steep catwalk He grabs
desperately onto railing with his left arm his gun-shot arn
stopping his fall as he cries out from intense pain

SKINNER

steps to edge of connected part of catwalk looking down the
steep runway at Lorredo clinging helplessly to railing
trying to raise his one remaining rifle to shoot Skinner

SKINNER
Do yourself a favor Give it up
End this misery call it quits
Zi25

Lorredo pulls himself up catwalk toward Skinner hand-over-
hand inching himself along holding onto railing for support

LORREDO
Don’t know the meaning of the word

BLAM -- Skinner shoots Lorredo through top of left hand

Lorredo lets go of railing sliding back down grabbing
railing with his right hand struggling now without the use
of his left hand to pull himself up toward Skinner by railing

SKINNER
What can you possibly hope to
achieve War’s over you’ve lost

BLAM -- Skinner shoots Lorredo through right hand

Lorredo tumbles down jamming his right leg between the
bars halting his slide

SKINNER
The only way to stop the Awakening
now is to expire me And you‘re
in no position to do that are you

Lorredo grimaces refusing to acknowledge pain as he
awkwardly starts up catwalk without the use of hands
pulling himself by his forearms and legs

SKINNER
Which part of you should we
dispose of next A leg perhaps

BLAM -- Skinner shoots Lorredo in right thigh Blood spurts
This time Lorredo can’t help but CRY OUT in agony and pain

SKINNER
So Sifter does feel pain afterall

LORREDO’S FINGERS

without the strength of hand muscles behind them grab into
the metal grating stopping his descent -- sharp edges
cutting deeply into his hands and fingers drawing more blood

SKINNER
You can’t kill me Immortality
was my reward from The Company
£23

BLAM -- Skinner shoots Lorredo in left thigh He cries out
again as he continues pulling himself up toward Skinner He
grits teeth Fighting pain Fighting death to reach Skinner
Not much further to Skinner Almost there Got to get there

SKINNER
Nothing can kill me Nothing

Blood fills Lorredo’s eyes blinding him trickling down his
arms from his numerous wounds threatening his grip on the
grating Almost to Skinner He’1l live long enough to do it

SKINNER
Any last words

Skinner smiles as he points rifle directly at Lorredo’s face
Lorredo reaches edge of platform where Skinner is kneeling
less than an arms reach in front of him He looks up at
Skinner squinting up at him through blood-filled eyes

LORREDO
I believe this belongs to you

With a burst of strength Lorredo thrusts up at Skinner with
THE THIRD DAGGER

THE BLADE penetrates deeply into Skinner’s stomach He lets
out a hellish-sounding howl as if an eternity of growing
untold misery had suddenly been released from within hin
SKINNER

falls to his knees face contorted into a sinister anguished
grin He laughs with both pleasure and pain

SKINNER
I’ll save you a place in hell

Still holding tightly onto handle of Dagger Lorredo crawls
up onto the leveled catwalk collapsing on his back He
smiles through clenched teeth his rage now realized

LORREDO
You do that

Lorredo pushes Dagger deeper into Skinner twisting blade
using both broken hands then pushing Skinner over railing

SKINNER

plummets several feet the menacing smile still visible on
his face as he bursts into flame laughing as he falls like
a burning meteor -- then EXPLODING just before he hits floor
ON CATWALK -- LORREDO

with last dying strength carries Helen rest of the way up
the precarious catwalk pulling himself along by the railing

OTHER SIDE OF CATWALK

As Lorredo climbs down the ladder the remaining part of
the catwalk COLLAPSES in a mass burning heap of twisted metal

DOGHEAD

Lorredo carefully inserts pardon into pocket and starts out

DOGHEAD
Nobody quits The Company

- LORREDO
I just did

DOGHEAD
Actually you didn’t You didn’t
read the fine print The pardon
only means that you’re on hiatus

Lorredo considers this a beat Then he points at Doghead
LORREDO
If I ever see that ugly mug of
yours again it’1ll be too soon

Just as Lorredo reaches door CLICK Door locks Lorredo
tries it but it won’t open He turns back to Doghead

LORREDO
