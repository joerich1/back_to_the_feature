WE RECOGNIZE Carruthers and Messner as the two Agents from
the PadicheSerna surveillance They are sitting with FB1I
Deputy Director STANLEY LOCKE A debrief is in progress

SUPER WASHINGTON DC
A Mafia Family Tree has been erected behind them with a
of Primo Sparazza at the top

LOCKE
Sparazza is rumored to have performed
in excess of one-hundred and thirty
contract murders including one of
the bureaus most celebrated agents
Freeman Heller You heard of The
Turnpike Murders that was Sparazza

MESSNER
I thought Heller was a double op

joining the Bureau in its heyday
He was the first operative assigned
with infiltrating the mob

Heller outdistancing the rest of his recruiting class ina
training run nearly a mile ahead of the next man

LOCKE (VO CONTD) (CONTD)
Full immersion and assimilation

everything that is now standard
operating procedure Heller
implemented way back when

CcuT TO
SCENE

Heller oversees every aspect of his transformation
radically

altering his appearance adding different mannerisms an

accent etcbefuddled FBI brass can only look on in awe

LOCKE (CONTD)
And as a result his undercover work
was wildly successful He eventually
reached the rank of Capo inside the
Carlotta crime familybut through
some internal slip-up his cover was
compromised and Primo Sparazza was
given the contract to kill him

HELLER faux mafioso full-time federal agent

LOCKE (VO)
There wasnt enough evidence to bring
formal charges so the case never
went to trial

Heller collapses the gunman looms over levels a 45
FIRES

LOCKE (CONTD)
Sparazza is a bit of a specter
Over the years the serious crimes
with which he was thought to be
involved including Hellers murder
could never be traced back to him

The gunman slinks back to his car as we--

that followed drew the interest of
nearly every major investigative
body operating under the canopy of
the federal government

That alone warrants total immunity
from prosecution and and a vanishing
act with Witness Protection

MESSNER
So the wiretaps we conducted on Serna

in rapid decline and before his date
with destiny it seems he wants one
last thingThe heart of his sworn
enemy A recently opened cash rich
escrow account has been traced back

Our window is now

DEEKS
Who posted his bail

DUPREE
His law firm same one that hired
me Israel walked out after he made
bail and nobodys seen him since

ELMORE
Jack if the rumors hold and Israel
is really the great white whale of
snitches then the mob is looking to
put all kinds of bullets into his
ass and pour some serious psychotics
into the mix to do just that So
what real incentive is there to track
him on something as small-time as a
skip trace when its putting you
and yours in the path of severe pain
and suffering and an almost certain
prelude to doom

searching for his cigs

The boys have retired to the bar for a round of dollar

A beat Dupree blows smoke flicks ash

DUPREE
So I guess youre not going

ELMORE
Shit if youre on a crazy jag why
stop there why not take Fort Knox
with a fucking slingshot or go into
Hell after HitlerI like your
chances a lot more

Dupree stubbing his cigarette

DUPREE
I know his location weve got the

passed out cold in a tangle of crotchless panties and

heels lying amongst smashed vodka bottles and ashtrays
coke-covered tabletops and tipped room service trays -

Israel sober nowcontemptuous of it all He starts

around them the way you would casualties on a battlefield
His bathrobe brushes over terrycloth catching one of the

hookers wigs tugging it free Israel looks down zooming
in on her scalp sees dandruff and scars gags disgust and
disdain He steps the wigs pulls He stops and slips the

bathrobe off letting it fall rather than pull her wig the
rest of the way off and ruin what illusion remains

He shuffles begins dropping Aces on their bodies like dead
enemy soldiers One of his bodyguards enters a bulging
slow-witted ex-bodybuilder by the name of HUGO CROOP

ISRAEL

because he sounded real concerned

ISRAEL

perceived to have failed Hoover
