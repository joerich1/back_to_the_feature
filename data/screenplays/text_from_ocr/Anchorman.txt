SCREEN MOVING TOWARDS US

Dozens of news shows flash on the screen ABC NBC CNN
FOX MSNBC CBS The Weather Channel ESPN etc etc All
fronted by dozens of anchors Jennings Brokaw Aaron Brown
Rather Chung etc etc

NARRATOR (VO)

(powerful and assured)
Television news There are hundreds
of 24 hours channels local and
network news shows bombarding us
every waking second And with each
show an endless list of news anchors
trying to convince you that they
and only they speak the truth And
what do these voices of the truth
tell us Be afraid Be very afraid

The shows multiply across the screen forming a cacophony of
anchors

NARRATOR (CONTD)
But there was a time in our not too
distant past when the world as we
know it was a much simpler place

We dissolve to WISPY CLOUDS and a BLUE SKY

NARRATOR (CONTD)
This was a less cynical time A time
when people believed everything they
heard on TV a time before cable
Three channels were all there was
and viewers were happy You heard me
right three channels

MUSIC a sparkling gliss

We emerge from the clouds to find ourselves over Center City
Portland 1973

MUSIC the initial pulsing bass lines of Cherry Cherry by
Neil Diamond

NARRATOR (CONTD)
It was 1973 and in a city like
Portland the news was clear and
if it wasnt you turned on the TV
and the man told you what it was
(MORE)

NARRATOR (CONTD)
Yes in this strange time men were
men and real men were anchormenand
in Portland one anchorman was the
balls Ron Burgundy And brother let
me tell you he knew how to wear a
friggin suit

MUSIC KICKS IN HARD Smash cut to RON BURGUNDY 38 walking

perfectly parted hair Hes a cross between Chuck Woolery
and Chucks brother Sean Woolery As he strolls down the

your hopes and dreams

same dream I too want to become a
network anchor

RON
Ha ha and after that you can be
King of Australia Seriously-—

ALICIA CORNINGSTONE
Im very serious Mr Burgundy Ive
wanted to be an anchor since I was a
little girl

As Alicia tells the story it is depicted in a series of
lightening-quick photo images

ALICIA CORNINGSTONE (CONTD)
Ive always been cursed with a talent
for pursuits usually dominated by
men As a little girl instead of
playing house I would play “drill
sergeant” or butcher Then in high
school I learned how to dunk and
could hit the three from ABA range
but the coach wouldnt let me play
with the boys So I tried to get a
job as a lumber jack But they
laughed at me Then one day I read
the PA announcements at school and
was hooked I knew I would be a news
anchor And yes its been
lonelyand difficultand lonely

There is a tear streaming down Alicias face

RON
Are you crying

ALICIA CORNINGSTONE
I dont think so Um we should
probably get going I swore I would
never get involved with a co-worker

Alicia starts to leave but Ron grabs her by the arm

RON
Wait What if just for tonight we
werent co-workers What if we were

just co-people

ALICIA CORNINGSTONE
I dont-

RON

reminiscent of his opening triumphant walk A business man
from a window yells at him

and clutching a stuffed Pink Panther doll

The phone rings and we pan to the living room and see a giant

over-sized answering machine We hear it pick up

RON (CONTD)
I happen to believe that back in
1876 when George Washington came
over on the Mayflower he had a dream
And we all take part in that dream
not by doing what we want but through
the process of voting As an anchor
Im not allowed to vote or to be

vote But I do know that freedom is
free

Quick flash to different viewers riveted to the TV
