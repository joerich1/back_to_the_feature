EXT TAGGART FARM DUSK

A cornfield in an evening breeze A lone wooden cross against
the dusky sky

WHOMP A SCARECROW suddenly thrown against it Sloppy
looking Overalls Pillow sack head Hat stitched on

Fourteen year old BILLY TAGGART stands on wooden steps at the
foot of the post so he can reach this high

Takes a length of bailing wire and reaches around the straw
man Finds himself nose to nose with its sewn on face

TAGGART
You get number three up and
don’t come in to eat till
you do

The boy looks over JACK TAGGART is a weathered looking
forty Working the post puncher across the field

He slides a long wooden post with a pointed tip into the
loader and then jumps back onto the seat of the fencing
machinery

PRAMP The wooden post is fired deep into the earth -by the
small cannon of the puncher pointing directly into the
ground

TAGGART
And check the other two
Make sure they’re wired up
good I don’t want ‘em
blowing down again if
there’s a big wind

Billy stares across the field at TWO MORE SCARECROWS Already
on their crosses A CROW LANDS ON THE MOST DISTANT IT CAWS
MAWKISHLY

BILLY
Lot of good they’re doing

PRAMP The boy turns to dad to protest But dad is hopping off the post

puncher now It has misfired
TAGGART
You been messing with this

post puncher

TAGGART
I told you what’d happen if
you screwed around with this
thing

Billy struggling to secure the first scarecrow

BILLY
I said I didn’t

Taggart throws a rag at the post puncher Moves toward their
small farmhouse

TAGGART
Jacky

Billy’s older brother JACK JR Seventeen Sticks his head out
the kitchen door

TAGGART
You messin’ around with that
Goddamned post puncher
again

JACK JR
No

Taggart throws a look out to Billy

JACK JR
Billy you little asshole
Why don’t you fink on
yourself for a change

TAGGART
Don’t use that kinda mouth
on your brother what did I
tell you

Jack Taggart disappears inside the barn Jack Jr glares at
little brother Turns to go back in the kitchen

Halted by BUTCH their BLACK LABRADOR RETRIEVER GROWLING IN
THE DIRECTION OF THE CORNFIELD

JACK JR
Go get him Go bite him in
the ass Butchy-boy

Jack Jr disappears back inside the kitchen BUTCH BARKS NOW
Excitedly Staring out into the corn where

Billy grumbles to himself on his way to Scarecrow Number Two

BILLY
“Don’t want ‘em blowing down
again”Big wind my ass”

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

HE CAN HEAR HIS DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE

BILLY
You’re the only big wind out
here

Billy arrives at the next scarecrow Walks behind it Checks
the bailing wire that holds it in place

RAKING ANGLE ON BILLY AND THE FAR SCARECROW The last
scarecrow some yards away turns and looks at the boy
scattering the crows on its head and shoulders

Billy turns to look

RACK FOCUS TO--the scarecrow It looks away at the same
instant

Billy wondering what he saw

The dog still at the outskirts of the corn rows YELPING NOW
A CLEAR WARNING TO THE BOY

DOG POV Billy moves toward that last scarecrow

THE DOG’S BARKS BUILD IN INTENSITY Wants to go after his
master Won’t Too afraid

BILLY
Will you shut-up

Billy glaring out at his dog Realizes something Turns
toward that last scarecrow -just a yard or so away

Are his eyes are playing tricks on him

This scarecrow is not one of the sloppy ones he made himself
This one wears a strange hat and a thick long coat

THE DOG BARKING INSANELY AGAIN
This doesn’t look like a scarecrow at all

BILLY TURNS STARTS TO RUN DOESN’T KNOW WHY SPRINTING
THROUGH CORN IT SLAPS AT HIM HE IS MOVING SO FAST

THE SCARECROW BLASTS OFF THE POST TOWARD HIM---

Not running --but flying after him A big dark shape
rocketing over the stalks

Before he can even think what kind of nightmare it must be--
KER-RANCCHHH IT TAKES THE KID DOWN WITH A FLYING TACKLE

THE CORN SHAKES VIOLENTLY WHERE THEY HIT THE GROUND THE DOG
BARKING INSANELY

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Dad bursting from the barn with a double barrel shoutgun
Jack Jr scrambling out the kitchen door in his bare feet

The corn still shakes violently Taggart running into the
field toward it

TAGGART
BILLY

SOMETHING IS MOVING THROUGH THE CORN AWAY FROM TAGGART WITH
INCREDIBLE SPEED

Taggart filling with fear as he runs faster The dog follows
with Jack Jr

AGGART

They’re gaining on it --something big is dragging something
not so big deeper into the field

BILLY’S POV ANGLE LOOKING UP AT THE RAGMAN DRAGGING HIM

Both men and the dog in the trail of broken stalks now
Running over one of Billy’s tennis shoes

TAGGART
SOMETHING BIG BREAKS OUT OF THE CORN AHEAD STARTLING THE
TAGGARTS ROCKETING OUT OF THE STALKS INTO THE NIGHT

It wears a scarecrow’s ragged coat and from it great wings
that rise and fall -blasting it skyward--

AHORRID SHAPE THAT CLUTCHES ANOTHER ITS PREY DANGLING FROM
ITS TALONS

There can be no mistaking the lifeless body of young Billy
Taggart being raced into the cloudy night sky

Dad stares completely transfixed Shot gun leveled but unable
to shoot Might hit Billy

THE DOG BARKS WILDLY up at the horrible thing that is now a
distant shape streaking past the cloudy moon

AS IT DISAPPEARS THERE COMES A SOUND SO EERIE AND FORLORN IT
COULD ALMOST BE THE VOICE OF JACK TAGGART’S HORROR AND
SORROW

A HOWLING SOUND THE DOG IT HOWLS UP AT THE MOON

Taggart and Jack Jr stare up nullified at the moon that
looks down on them

In the long drag trail of broken stalks the teen shotgun
tucked under his arm pushes husks around with the toe of his

something hidden under the trampled leaves

Jack Jr moves forward Offering his discovery in his open
palm Taggart doesn’t move

JACK JR
Look pop

But dad doesn’t Doesn’t even blink That stare so dead

JACK JR
It was out in the corn

Taggart finally looks to his son’s open palm Stares for a
moment at the object Looks up to his boy as he slowly takes
it in his own fingers

A smooth star shaped piece of metal Strikingly similar to
the thing we have just seen pulled out of the bus tire

Beyond that Jack Jr in safety Boge les - Works in a shower of

Inside someone works diligently in another fountain of
sparks

piece of metal With a ferociously pointed tip A spear A

He stares ahead with that same look of the dead tainted only
by the small welling in his eyes A look full of purpose

Barnes unsure at first what he is looking at

Then a slow horrible dawning washes over him His face pales
and his eyes grow wide with horror

ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD Coach Barnes stumbles back from the

Palms out Startles everyone

open and he falls up the steps reaching out for Hanna

COACH HANNA
What the Hell’s the matter

Barnes points to the Ice Cream Truck Is about to say Then
sees all the faces of the kids watching him

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Leans in and whispers to Hanna What Hanna hears gives him a
look of utter disbelief Barnes doesn’t care if he believes
or not

Behind his back Jake gives Braddock the finger as he steps
down the aisle

Jake another flashlight A flare too

Betty and Jake step onto the shoulder Barnes pops his head
back in the bus

COACH BARNES

switches until the ICE CREAM TUNE STOPS

Releases the emergency brake Betty and Coach Barnes at the
back of the truck preparing to push it forward

fast she helps him up Practically throws him back on the bus
and dives for the handle to the bus doors

Catches her breath and turns to look down the shadowy bus
The whole team staring back at her in shock

She moves quickly into the driver’s seat and turns the engine
over

BUS DRIVER BETTY
It had wings Big fucking
wings

Minxie hears it first Rises slowly out of her seat Eyes
fixed above her

side of the bus- big enough to blot out the moonlight in each
window as it speeds by

SOME KIND OF WAILING SOUND AS IT PASSED

People out of their seats trying to follow its trajectory
Watching out the back window No sign of it This thing was
big and it was fast

Frightened looks Unspoken fear everywhere They close their
windows Slide them up and shut Locking them

WOOOSSHHHHH It rips down the left side of the bus in the
other direction now swooping up to avoid all but the tiniest
throw of light from the high beams

Something utterly unreal is buzzing the school bus

Grinds the gears

You got other options

KEE-RACCKK The javelin snaps in two Braddock turns him

BRADDOCK
Well one of em’s not to sit

poke it with sticks

Izzy slides first half out of its case Tests its weight

Minxie turns away from the discussion and looks back at the

tears

RHONDA
We don’t know its coming
back
IZZY
We need a plan either way
BRADDOCK

What else you wanna do Make
slingshots outta jockstraps

Minxie whirls around and waves her arms to silence everyone
Her pale look panics Izzy and Braddock --as she motions ever
so quietly behind her

The boys move cautiously forward

ANGLE CREEPING AROUND THE PARTITION The doors come into
view A dark cloaked figure is staring in

The brim of a ragged hat shadows its face What it wears
could be rags from a scarecrow

Nullified faces staring back at it Braddock waving madly for
everyone to “get down and lay low

Everyone ducks down below window level Seats visible from
the bus doors empty quickly and quietly

Its bowed head raises up Nose almost touching the panes of

the doors There can be no mistake --it is trying to sniff
through the glass

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Izzy steps back bumping into Braddock He stumbles and by
the time they right themselves

--the figure is no longer at the doors

A silent panic filters down the bus Faces huddled below the
windows in every seat

Jake braves a peek above window level The Creeper’s face
raising up with his

Only its eyes are closed In the middle of a deep inhale

Jake ducks down quickly again his flashlight clutched to him

The Creeper’s eyes open Strain to look down at him He is
practically under his seat now and staring across the aisle
to Rhonda and others caught by its

strange grayish skin Claw-like tentacles around its face
Dark strangely human eyes harbored in that clearly inhuman
head

It presses its face closer to the glass as it inhales again
Seems to savor the surrounding air

Tracing in it a path that leads down to Jake again About to
move Rhonda shakes her head ‘no’ --stops him

Jake looks more like a frightened boy than one of the biggest
boys on the Varsity team Looks at Rhonda helplessly

The Creeper surprises everyone when it backs away from the
window now and starts walking down the length of the bus

EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME
MOVING BEHIND THE CREEPER The Creeper taking his stroll

The kids move with him Track him along the windows Crowding
the aisle and vacating seats that are too close to its path

Jake looking back at the rear door The one he tied shut with
a gym towel

THONG The door opens as much as the towel will allow
Everyone flailing back Izzy brandishing the javelin as a
weapon Dante levels the flare gun Jake blasts the rear door
with the flashlight

No Creeper can be seen UNTIL A SUDDEN AND STACCATO SNIFFING

DRAWS EVERYONE’S ATTENTION LOWER To the small opening where
the door won’t close all the way

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602 46

The Creeper’s nose is just inside

Its sniffing is so intense --its nostrils flutter at an
inhuman rapidity

DOUBLE D
What the fuck is this thing
doing

KIMBALL
What’s it look like its
doing

The Creeper rises up in the door window now Eyes peering in
Somehow singling Dante out of the mass of cowering kids

Dante immobilized by the wicked smile the rows of teeth
Almost flinches when it winks at him

DANTE
(barely a whisper)
What the fuck

RHONDA

We’re dreaming

(even softer)
Right Minx’ This is your
dream and we’re all in it
“cause that thing couldn’t
be there Not if this was
real

The Creeper’s grayish hand moves inside the door now Grips
it It drops its head back and takes an even deeper inhale

Like a gourmet chef enjoying the bouquet of a savory dish

This time it stops mid-sniff Turns slowly into the window
This time pressing its nose to the glass

Eyes leveling at the terrified kids staring back at it

The Creeper’s grey and leathery hand curls those hideous
fingers and points directly at them

Braddock points to himself You mean me

The Creeper lowers his brow Eyes burning out Keeps pointing
Braddock turns slowly to see who is standing behind him Who is
he pointing at

BETO
Jesus Christ

Beto points to himself Me Beto tries getting out of the
line of vision

More kids part leaving only who could be the subject
It is Double D

It smiles at him with that horrible grin Rows of razor sharp
teeth More frightened whispers

KIMBALL
That is fucked up man I
think he likes you most of
all scarecrow

DOUBLE D
Shut the fuck up

KER-CHUNK The Creeper grapples the rear door with both
hands now It wants to come in

Dante a terrified step forward leveling the flare gun at it

IZZY
Don’t fire that thing in
here

He flashes a look to Izzy

DOUBLE D
He’s right it’1l fill this
place up like a smoke bomb

The terrycloth rope is ripping now as the Creeper puts
pressure on the door

BRADDOCK
Bucky get on those front
doors and get ready to open
“em

KER-LUNK The door opens wider as the towel rope frays down
to its last threads

BRADDOCK
Do it

Behind the Creeper a light is growing

DANTE
(gun still leveled)
I don’t care man it comes
inside -I’m gonna cream this
thing

EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

ROLLING UP ON THE CREEPER The Creeper turns slowly from the
back of the bus -to stare down the two Lane at

Headlights approaching from the distance
INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME
The kids stare Hearts racing Panicked looks exchanged
IZZY
I don’t believe this That’s

The Creeper is staring down the two-lane Starting to be
backlit Obscured by the door now

Jake blasts the flashlight beam down there again The Creeper
is gone

The kids exchange looks Can they hope for this much

IZZY
That’s fucking help

He smiles Forces his enthusiasm Kids crowd the windows on
both sides Looking for signs of the Creeper

The headlights near They are high and far apart Like a truck

BRADDOCK
Bucky you on those doors

They look at him like he’s crazy

DOUBLE D
You still wanna run

Headlights closer now

BUCKY
Jonny can’t run his foot is

JAKE
Not the ice cream truck and
that is the only thing that
matters
(looks back at them
all)

It’s not is it
EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

It is in fact a pick-up truck And it slows as it sees the
big bus angled across the two-lane at its haphazard angle

INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

The kids actually jump up and down and hoot Elated that a
rescue is about to take place

DOUBLE D
What do we do We tell ‘em
what happened right

IZZY
We don’t tell ‘em anything
“til we are out of here and
a long ways away

BRADDOCK
It’s a small pick-up
(turns back to
everyone)
We’re all not gonna fit in it

This sobering notion is absorbed by the group as Rhonda steps
forward slowly

RHONDA
Oh my God

It dawns on her the same time it dawns on Minxie and Chelsea

RHONDA
They’re gonna stop
(off horrified looks)
They’ re gonna stop and
they’re gonna get out

Out the back window the truck does creep forward slowing
just a few short yards away

RHONDA
They’re gonna get out of
that truck

Double D shaking his head an impossible “no” Jake ripping
at the last of the towel that ties the rear door shut

HONK HONK What are they doing making so much noise

The driverside door opens A WOMAN IN HER LATE THIRTIES gets
out in an overcoat Peers ahead

She can hear muffled voices rising in panic inside the bus
This makes her take a step forward when--

The back door of the school bus flies open and anxious faces
and voices come out in a panicked cacophony

DOUBLE D
Get back in the car

The woman is startled Stops Stares ahead

DOUBLE D BRADDOCK
Lady get back in the car Get back inside Get back

full of people all yelling at her

BRADDOCK
Get back in the fucking car--

The woman takes one more step forward-

WOMAN

She stares at them They at her Realizing some horrible
threat is posed to her she takes one small step back--

SHEE-WRANNKKK SOMETHING LARGE AND WINGED STREAKS ACROSS
THE TWO-LANE JUST OVER HER HEAD

Moving so fast that it’s inky black blur vanishes before the
kids even register that this lady is gone

COINS FROM A COAT POCKET ROLL AROUND NOISILY ON THE ASPHALT
Remnants All that remains where she stood

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

A busload of kids stare out the back of the bus in utter
shock

A long horrible silence of just staring Staring at the
idling truck minus its driver in the middle of the dark two
ane

Then something is clearly screaming toward them out the
dark

The Creeper has banked around --rocketing toward the bus --
his prey tightly in hand

INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Braddock and others clamber to slam the ill-fitting back door
shut before the flying horror is upon them

Like some surreal nightmare -THIS SCREAMING WOMAN HELD OUT
BY THE CREEPER IS FLOWN PAST THE WINDOWS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF
THE BUS--

The Creature turns and looks at them as it passes showing its

rows of razor teeth Then takes her higher Up into the night

EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Kids stare after her in shock Faces lining the windows of
the bus Watching in horror and awe

The moon reflected against the glass -and the terrible winged
thing black against the moonlit clouds

INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Jake slams the emergency door shut Holds the door closed
again Breathless Rhonda grabs onto Braddock He holds her

Minxie staring out the windshield with others Her eyes roll
up into her head and she faints dead away Bucky and Izzy
catch her drag her to a seat

FRAME WASHES OUT AS

Bucky and others look down at her with great concern
EXT DREAM CORNSCAPE DAY
Minxie rises slowly into frame staring ahead at

The Taggart farm’s cornfield Someone moving toward her
through the corn

Afraid at first she realizes as the figure nears this is a

boy her age Shirtless Trance-like A rose tatoo around his
navel

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

DARRY JENNER STEPS OUT OF THE CORN He is naked And has a
dark dazed look about him as he stares at Minxie Then
raises a hand

She won’t take it so he gently reaches down and takes hers
Pulls her gently into the corn

Minxie is confused Can see he is leading her toward a
distant scarecrow on its post

SHE CAN HEAR DISTANT AND GUTTURAL SOUNDS GARBLED WORDS FROM
A DEEP ANIMAL LIKE THROAT

As Darry pulls her nearer to it she can see its tattered
rags flapping in a soft breeze

THE VOICE GROWS LOUDER AND MORE CONFUSING SOME CHANT OF
WORDS THAT SHE CANNOT MAKE OUT A SCRAMBLED STRING OF WORDS
THAT STOPS ABRUPTLY AS THEY ARRIVE BEFORE THE SCARECROW

She has to look up at it The sun glints behind it as Minxie
takes a tentative step past Darry staring up

MINXIE
What

The answer comes from Darry

DARRY
Every 23rd Spring for 23
days it gets to eat

MINXIE
To eat what

She turns as she ask the question -Darry is now a horrific
mess His face is cut and his eyes sockets are empty Looking
exactly like he did the last time we saw him

DARRY
Eat us

BEHIND MINXIE THE SCARECROW’S RAGS ERUPT AS A MASSIVE PAIR OF
WINGS EXPLODE FROM ITS BACK THE SOUND IS SO WICKED IT
STARTLES HER--

Startling Izzy Bucky and everyone else looking down at her --

Minxie lurches out of her faint with a full votume gasp

with the last of a nylon rope and a piece of broken javelin

We send out a runner

Braddock gets everyone’s attention He leaves Rhonda
Crouches in the middle of the aisle like a Captain about to

call a play

BRADDOCK
One guy Someone fast We
give him the flare gun or
something

Give him anything we can to
help defend himself -but he
takes off into the field

Stunned looks everywhere Did he just say that

BRADDOCK
Whatever the Hell it is it
can’t come after everyone
What’s it gonna do if we all
run in different directions
Its gonna have to pick out one-

TAGGART

Who is this

A RUSH OF STATIC OVER THE RADIO AND TAGGART’S VOICE Faces
of disbelief Did they just hear that

BUCKY
This is Andy Buck

TAGGART
Where are you

The boys and girls make sounds Tentative happy sounds
Contact made Dante feverishly shushes everyone as Bucky
continues

TAGGART
(filtered)
Anything else you can tell
me

ANGLE TOWARD THE BACK OF THE BUS Huddled around the radio
the kids don’t see the familiar black shape running onto the
two-lane behind them and leaping up -impossibly high

BUCKY
(almost teary with relief)
If I tell you anymore you’11
think I was outta my fucking
mind Just tell me you’re on
your way out here please

KEE-RANNKK THE CREEPER LANDS AND PUNCHES THROUGH THE ROOF
RIGHT OVER BUCKY

BOYS AND GIRLS RECOILING THE CREEPER HAS GOTTEN BUCKY BY THE
HEAD AND STARTS TO PULL HIM UP--

Braver boys leap forward Grab onto him

RHONDA
Look out

SHE CHARGES THROUGH THE FRAY WITH THE JAVELIN AS BUCKY
SCREAMS AND GOES HIGHER TOWARD THE HOLE

Rhonda thrusts the spear upward Right through the roof of
the bus and--

EXT BUS ROOFTOP NIGHT SAME TIME

KEE-OOOCHHHH THRU THE CREEPER’S SHOULDER IT COMES OUT
THE OTHER SIDE AS THE THING WAILS LIKE A DEMON FROM HELL

INT BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Rhonda holding onto the spear She yanks it down with all her
might--
Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

EXT BUS ROOFTOP NIGHT SAME TIME

-savagely pulling the spear out of the Creeper’s shoulder
IT WAILS AGAIN

INT BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

The Creeper’s hand pulls Bucky up harder now He hits the
ceiling

Rhonda leaps forward with the spear again THRUSTS IT UP EVEN
HARDER

A TREMENDOUS WAIL FROM ABOVE AND Bucky falls back down hard
EXT BUS ROOFTOP NIGHT SAME TIME

The Creeper on his knees staggers as he tries to stand We
then see that THE JAVELIN HAS GONE OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD
ONE OF ITS EYEBALLS SKEWERED AT THE TIP

INT BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Everyone watches as part of the javelin still sticking down
through the hole Starts to get longer

EXT BUS ROOFTOP NIGHT SAME TIME

The Creeper has grabbed the pole and is S pulling it back down
through his head -the eyeball with it-

THIS BECOMES EXCRUCIATING THE CREEPER THRASHES AROUND STILL
GRIPPING THE POLE --WHICH IS STARTING TO RIP THROUGH THE
STRANGE DUSTY CONSISTENCY OF THE UPPER PART OF HIS HEAD

INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Inside they can only hear it wail See the javelin as it
falls past the windshield onto the road

The kids watching breathless Double D shipping into a
forward seat to try and peer up through the hole in the roof

POV THRU HOLE The Creeper stands in horrible pain His
mouth roars open-- in profile he looks intact -but when he
whirls his head toward the hole -HIS RIGHT EYE AND
SURROUNDING FOREHEAD ARE MISSING

Double D watches in a daze Whispers to the rest
DOUBLE D

Half his fucking head’s
gone

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

EXT BUS ROOFTOP NIGHT SAME TIME

THE CREEPER RAGES AGAIN LAUNCHING STRAIGHT UP INTO THE NIGHT
SKY --TILL BOTH HE AND HIS HORRIBLE WAIL ARE SWALLOWED UP BY
DISTANCE AND NIGHT

Double D peering up through the hole in the roof

DOUBLE D
Fuck

INT BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Boys and girls crowd the hole and the windows to look up
Exchanging looks -afraid to think that maybe the tables have
turned Some try to laugh finally -a nervous laugh halted by-

A WHISTLING SOUND GROWS FROM HIGH ABOVE GETTING LOUDER
FASTER SOMETHING CUTTING THROUGH THE NIGHT

Like a bomb dropping
EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

KA-BLAMMM SOMETHING LARGE AND DARK PLUMMETS OUT OF THE
NIGHT ONTO THE ROOF OF THE BUS

The glass on all the side windows blow out raining over the
two-lane

INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

THE BUS JOLTS MASSIVELY AS PEOPLE ARE THROWN FROM THEIR
SEATS SOME HITTING THE FLOOR WITH THE IMPACT

In the next instant the whole thing rocks to stillness And
silence

Kids staring in disbelief At the center of the bus -the roof
has buckled severely

Izzy shaking his head no Can’t be what he thinks it is
Can’t be

He and others rushing to the driver seat attempting to see
up through the hole

Laying across a seat with his swollen ankle Jonny Young can
already see something dangling down in front of his window

JONNY
You gotta be motherfucking
kidding

-it is the tip of the Creeper’s wing

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME
ANGLE BOOMING UP ABOVE THE BUS

We rise up from the boys straining to see out their window
to show that the Creeper has indeed smashed directly into the
roof of the bus

One wing hangs down past the blown out windows
INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

At the belly of the bend two sections of sheet metal have
split revealing part of the Creeper’s body

Jake leads with his flashlight as he and others examine it

Whatever part it is -a breeze from the missing windows
starts to blow it awayin tiny drifts of dust

JAKE
Man this thing is cooked

Braddock stares at it a moment longer and nods to Bucky

BRADDOCK
Get that door open
(to everyone)
We go Now

CHELSEA
It’s dead right

BRADDOCK
Don’t know don’t care
Bucky

Bucky is really pulling that handle but it won’t give

BUCKY
Something got screwed up

Others come to help Double D slams against the doors while
others grapple the handle with Izzy

BRADDOCK
(moves to Jake)
Get that shit off the exit
and get it open

Jake looks at him like easy for you to say He motions to
the severely sealed up rear door

Braddock starts pulling at the ropes The bus rocks as Double
D slams into the doors at the front of the bus

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602 76

Frantic activity ALL STOPPED BY THE GROWING SOUND OF GROANING
METAL

Loud and louder now Kids turning toward the center of the
bus Some recoiling into their seats

KEE-RANNKK THE SPLIT IN THE ROOF GIVES WAY AND A GIANT
WING CRASHES INTO THE CENTER OF THE BUS

Kids flee in both directions -until the gray dust settles and
reveals the massive wing is not moving

it is however dividing the bus into two sections fore and
aft

Most stand silent in a kind of awe of the wing’s incredible
physiognomy Translucent from one side in the flashlight
beam

BUCKY
What in the Hell are we
looking at

Braddock storms back to Jake again

BRADDOCK
Come on

I made it so it wouldn’t
open man Someone give me a
knife or something

They pull at the knots in the ropes again

KIMBALL
(nods to the others in the
front half of the bus)
Come on D’ Everybody This
side

The thought of having to traverse the wing is not a happy
one No one wants to be the first

DOUBLE D
I am not gonna touch that
thing

KIMBALL

This is the way out man you
just gonna sit back there
and wait for the Red Cross
Get your ass over here

Double D approaches the wing warily Studies it closely
Starts to climb around it Over seats to avoid contact

eee

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

KIMBALL
(bows his head in mock shame)
Oh man show like you got a
pair

DOUBLE D
Fuck you

Double D comes down behind the wing -on the back half of the
bus Chelsea is closest But she shakes her head ‘no’

Izzy pushes his way through Steps to the wing Stares at it

Doesn’t climb over the seats Is feeling braver He squeezes
around it

Has to push against it to clear his path and realizes its
folding capabilities

IZZY
This thing’s like a fucking
shower curtain man Look

He folds the wing up a bit A nervous laugh Does it again
This time really high Walks under it to the other side
Turns and lets Chelsea and Rhonda step under it as he holds
it up high

IZZY
Come on

Dante is next and not be out done --grabs the wing and folds
it up even more

DANTE
Shower curtain
(holds it up even higher)
This is a fucking piece of
toilet paper---

SHEEWOCCKKK THE GREAT WING UNFURLS AT LIGHTNING SPEED AND
WRAPS AROUND DANTE --COCOONING HIM IN ITS LEATHERY FABRIC

Both sides of the bus population rear back -piling up at
entrances and exits that cannot open

THEY WATCH DANTE’S BODY STRUGGLE INSIDE THE POWERFUL WING AS
IF HE WERE TRAPPED INSIDE A GIANT ANACONDA

Kids banging on both exits Screaming at the horror of
The wing wrapping even tighter and starting to lift him up
through the split ceiling Like a hideous curtain veiling
with its thin membrane Dante’s entire body

Kids can see Dante’s face trying to breathe as it goes up out
of sight

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Izzy and Double D charge forward Almost falling onto it
Try wrapping their arms around Dante’s wing-wrapped body

It quakes violently as they grapple with it Trying to pull
him down yanking harder and harder--

--until he slips out of the wing as it disappears back up
onto the roof and a crimson splatter spraying the ceiling
overhead

Izzy and the others crash to their Knees with rescued Dante
Until they realize something is horribly wrong

They back away leaving Dante Kneeling on the bus floor -
without his head Arms still moving as he falls forward

EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

The Creeper kneeling on top of the bus In the deep
indentation of the roof Rips at his shirt

CU ANGLE TILTING UP THE CREEPER

The tearing cloth reveals his reptilian stomach -and
something enormously Large sliding down its gullet Dante’s
eyes nose and chin outlined in the grayish skin as it moves
down the throat

eee UP FROM THIS TO REVEAL The Creeper’s horribly mangled
ead

The Lower half barely able to harbor the gaping mouth that
smacks its lips having just ingested this human head

The Creeper stands now Its tentacles opening---
INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Jake tearing at the cloth ropes on the back exit as others
help him

While boys on the other end of the bus slam against the doors
with all their might Double D scrambling for Dante’s flare
gun Fishing for the flares in the headless body’s pockets
EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

360 AROUND THE CREEPER

The Creeper stands Its tattered clothes fall to its feet
His wings unfurled As he grapples his badly damaged head
with both hands and tears it off its shoulders with A
HORRIBLE WAIL

The Creeper’s head is only attached to the tentacle plate by
some gummy strings of goo -they finally snap off

eK

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602 79

Leaving an empty shell where only its tentacles remain
INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

The Creeper’s head hits the asphalt as kids inside watch this
-still frantically pounding away

EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Tentacles that reach down inside the half skull and pull up
the Creeper’s new head

Dante’s

His own pinkish skin cradled in place by the tentacles --as
jt assimilates into the grayish tone of the Creeper’s
wrinkled flesh

INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Chelsea and others trying to peek up through the split roof
to see -when GLOOP A slimy glob of something falls onto
the girl’s face

She freaks

Other stare up -just catching a glimpse of the Creeper
launching into the air from the top of the bus

Just as THONG Jake gets the last of the lashings off the
rear exit and it swings open -revealing the idling pick-up
truck

All kids staring out at it Wondering if in this silence they
should--

Braddock blasts towards the back exit and lurches onto the
asphalt

EXT BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Before he can take two steps toward the truck Double D
Kimball and others follow

A mass exodus of the bus begins Attention on the sky the
kids storm the old pick-up Jake overtakes Braddock and they
struggle at the driver’s door

Jake leapsup into the driver seat but is dragged out by
Braddock Braddock lurches up to the seat but is pulled down
by Jake

Jake leaps up into the driverseat but Braddock drags him out-

as Kimball and Double D rush up Kimball slides behind the
wheel

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Braddock won’t have this Drags Kimball out of the driver
seat

Double D lunges at Braddock for this --both rolling on the
asphalt as Kimball tears Braddock off his buddy

In the meantime Bucky jumps behind the wheel while others
have already crammed into the passenger side

Way too many people Some fight being yanked out Others
still pressing

Kids hang out the doors and off the sides as Bucky lurches it
forward Some can’t hold on hit the asphalt hard

Bucky guns the engine as Braddock grabs him through the
window Will not Let him steer

Bucky just picks up speed The truck sways erratically toward
the back of the bus Braddock has to let go because--

KA-BASHHH THE TRUCK RAMS THE BUS’ REAR AND HARD
INT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

CLONG Chelsea helping Jonny down the aisle The impact
send all the kids rolling

EXT BUS NIGHT SAME TIME

Bucky throws the truck in reverse The back door of the bus
clangs noisily to the asphalt

Bucky swerves around the bus --across the yellow line boys
running from nowhere directly in his way

Including Kimball who circled around the bus --WHAM Bucky
hits him hard -Kimball goes right up onto the windshield

Bucky swerves across the two-lane as Kimball’s body falls to
the ground

Double D races to Kimball Kneels to him Screams as
Braddock and many others race after the truck Chelsea almost
falling down the bus steps to join them

One boy grabbing the tailgate and letting the truck drag him
as it races away

AREAL VIEWCREEPER POV The pick-up racing away from the
pandemonium Not so much noise up ere The quiet of an
evening wind until A HORRIBLE WAIL CUTS THROUGH THE NIGHT

Everyone running after the truck stop and look skyward

Double D looks up slowly from Kimball’s lifeless body

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

The Creeper is in front of the moon In full glory Wings
rising and falling silently as it looks down at him

And then dives

ANGLE SWOOPING DOWN TOWARD EARTH As the kids flee off the
road and across the field we are dive bombing them

IZZY

The Creeper sweeping in from above like a crop duster
lowering to snatching level

Boys and girls running Some dive and crawl under the bus
Others dash into the field but there is no where to hide The
field is so big there is no place to hide

on toward Double D

Double D running like his heart will burst out of his chest

IZZY
HE’S RIGHT BEHIND YOU D
POV OF SWOOPING CREEPER

Swooping after Double D The kid reaches down struggles for
the flare gun -the barrel stuck deep in his pants pocket

THE CREEPER ALMOST UPON HIM CAN HEAR THE WINGS FLAPPING THEY
ARE SO CLOSE---

The Creeper’s mouth opens and A HORRIBLE WAIL COMES OUT

Double D whipping out the flare gun just as he missteps
Falls Goes down hard and quick

SHH-WOONK The Creeper flies right over him talons
reaching out but missing him

Double D still rolling in the grass

The demon swings up into the air still sailing forward but
looking back at Double D and wailing again -this time out of
frustration

ANGLE FLYING AWAY FROM DOUBLE D

Double D looking up and over- at the Creeper’s other
intended Jake still sprinting toward the horizon

The Creeper sets his sites and dives again

DOLLEY SHOT WITH BOYS AND APPROACHING CREEPER

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

It looks like the 100 Yard Dash -only for life and death--
Jake in the lead with Braddock just behind

Braddock racing like there will be no tomorrow --and there
might not-- the Creeper rockets over his head

Looking back as if a quick scent of something has him
reassessing Braddock

Then he is soaring on toward the only target left Jake still
out in front as he sprints for his life

IZZY
JAKE

THE CREEPER SWOOPS IN RIGHT ON TARGET AND THE BIG STRONG KID
IS LIFTED RIGHT OFF HIS FEET -SCREAMING AS THE CREEPER’S
TALONS SINK INTO HIM----

DOLLEY SHOT WCREEPERJAKE CONTINUES Jake still running as
he screams --lifted off the ground and launched into the air
in the clutches of the Creeper

RHONDA
JAKE

Observers everywhere stop Breathless

JAKE POV AS HE IS LIFTED INTO THE AIR Jake streaking away
from the ground Izzy leaps on him but can’t hold on Drops
off as Jake Leaves behind the astonished and the horrified
Staring up as they get smaller and smaller

ON JAKE Jake looking up in great pain at his captor Wings
flapping throwing shadow on and off the horrible visage of
the Creeper

Though in the rising and falling shadow the Creeper’s
silhouette does in fact look like

JAKE
(horrified)
Dante

It looks down at him with Dante’s face surrounded by those
tentacles -THEY FLY OPEN AND IT WAILS AT HIM

In pain and horror Jake screams back at it

A SCREAM HEARD ACROSS THE NIGHT AS THE TWO STREAK PAST THE
PALE FACE OF THE MOON AND UPWARD

EXT COUNTRY ROAD NIGHT SAME TIME

BUTCH THE DOG HOWLS SUDDENLY and the Taggart pick-up truck
brakes to a halt

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Both Taggart and son know this sound all to well They look
at the animal baying up at the sky and Taggart hops out with
his shotgun

Dad moves to the side of the truck and pets the dogs head
while scanning the moonlit clouds

JACK JR
Daddy

The boy is staring ahead where someone darts across the two-
lane in the distance

Taggart watches as the figure runs back to the center of the
road and stares down at the headlights

This is a kid And sprinting now toward the truck

BUTCH STOPS HOWLING AND STARTS BARKING LIKE CRAZY AT THE
APPROACHING RUNNER

Taggart steps onto the running board of the truck and Jack
Jr Rolls toward them Meeting them half way down the lane

Minxie breathless

She stares at Jack Taggart and his son like they are
salvation No words Just staring

THEN BUTCH BARKS WILDLY and Minxie crams into the truck cab
while Taggart and son look at each other

EXT NEW FIELD NIGHT

Izzy slowly peering over the tall grass His quiet whisper

IZZY
Farmland farmland and
fucking farmland

DOUBLE D
And no fucking farm

Both turn now and crawl back through the grass beneath the
single massive oak that shadows them in this large field

Part of a group huddled together Izzy Rhonda Chelsea and
Braddock - cuts and swollen eyes from the fist fight at the
truck

RHONDA
We’ve gotta run into people
somewhere

DOUBLE D
Maybe some of the others had
better Luck

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

BRADDOCK
Or worse

Chelsea staring out Pale and shaken

CHELSEA
I left him
(off Izzy’s look)
qonny I left him stuck on
the bus

BRADDOCK
That’s real good man

Chelsea looks devastated The others glare at Braddock

RHONDA
Shut up Scotty

CHELSEA
No he’s right Jesus what
kind of person would get
scared enough to fucking do
that

IZZY
Well Scotty for one

Braddock glares a killer glare at Izzy for this

IZZY
In fact it sounds like every
fucking one of us did so
don’t go pointing the

finger
BRADDOCK

Hey faggot put a dick in it
IZZY

I am through with you you
brainless asshole-

Izzy snaps Only Double D stops Izzy from attacking

DOUBLE D
Come on Izzy just forget

IZZY

(at Braddock)
You ever had a faggot beat

DOUBLE D
He’s a piece of fucking
history man -just leave it

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers

Double D

DOUBLE D
(softly to Braddock)
You think you’re the man of
the hour Pulled Big K
outta that fucking truck and
now he’s dead

BRADDOCK
Hey Bucky is the one with
Kimball’s toe tag in his
pocket --don’t try and put
that on me-

RHONDA
Everyone just shut up

BRADDOCK
Let’s not waste anymore time
being polite okay We know
who this thing wants

It had its pick of twenty of
us running around back there
and it only went for three

One was Jake and he got him

Dante was another and it
chewed his fucking head off
so no offense Double D but
the other one was you

IZZY
Woa-woa-woa hold on-

BRADDOCK

(above a whisper)
We all saw the way he
sniffed you out back on
that bus Just like he did
Beto Dante and Jake

(off his look)
It comes back here it’s
coming back for one reason

stares at him

BRADDOCK
Sorry to be so blunt but we
just dropped a notch on the
ucking food chain man

RHONDA
Scotty stop shouting

BRADDOCK

(a cutting whisper to her)

This is about living and
dying now and he is marking
us as food for this thing

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II

She glares at him Shakes her head like she doesn’t Know him

BRADDOCK
I’m only saying what
everybody else standing here
right now is thinking

DOUBLE D
Chelsea that true

Chelsea stares at him -polarized by his question Comes back

with barely a whisper

CHELSEA
What if he’s right
(still shaken)
I mean let’s think about it

IZZY
What’s there to think
about

CHELSEA

What if this thing really is
only after the ones he
picked out on the bus

IZZ
We don’t know who he picked
out on that bus Christ he
looked at all of us

DOUBLE D
Look you don’t wanna be
around me get your ass
outta here

CHELSEA
I’m sorry I am but I don’t
wanna end up like Dante back
there I mean Jesus did you
see what it did to him

21602

Her frozen tears terrify Double D A horrible truth is dawning

CHELSEA
There’s Lots of room out
here Lots of directions to

go

DOUBLE D

Okay I’1l split then
(glares at Braddock)
I’1l split off from the rest
of you Maybe I’11l draw some

heat

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

IZZY
I’m going with you

DOUBLE D
(closer to Braddock)
I’m gonna head east Why
don’t you keep going west
(Cicily)
That’s away from me “bro’”
(a whispered
confidence)
But lets get one thing
straight He looked at you
too Back on the bus -I saw
him and so did you

Braddock looking out at everyone else

DOUBLE D

It looked right at you and
when it flew past you back
there It did it again That
means it looked at you
twice

(looks him in the eye)
So you keep your little
blacklist just know that
I’m the one getting the Hell
away from you

“Cause when he takes you out
-and I hope he does wanna
be as far away from your
sorry ass as can

Double D starts walking

BRADDOCK
This is about staying alive
man
(off Double D glare)
Look I’m sorry Double D

IZZY
You are so right about that

Izzy moves after Double D

RHONDA
You’re really gonna let them
go

BRADDOCK

Why you wanna go with them

Rhonda stares sad and shocked at him

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

RHONDA
We coulda’ protected him
maybe We coulda’ protected
all of us If we stuck
together
Rhonda starts moving off too

RHONDA
You know like a team

She joins the twosome that moves away as Braddock looks on
EXT SCHOOL BUS NIGHT

Backlit now by approaching headlights the school bus sits
even more distressed across the glass sprinkled two-lane

Jack Jr stops Surveys the scene from behind the wheel as he
blasts a spotlight forward

BUTCH STARTS TO HOWL AGAIN A TERRIBLE ERIE SOUND THAT MAKES
TAGGART LOOK AT HIS SON

Taggart gets out Stopped by Minxie’s soft words
MINXIE
You won’t be able to kill
it
Taggart looks at her THE DOG HOWLS AGAIN
MINXIE
Doesn’t matter what you do
to it it’1ll still come
back
ANOTHER HOWL MAKES THIS EVEN MORE CHILLING
Taggart’s expression reveals nothing He might take her for
crazy Impossible to tell as he hops up in the back of the
pick-up Moves into the freshly welded pulpit
THE DOG WHINES A LITTLE
Taggart scans the night sky and slowly reaches down

Lifts a leather strap Throws it over his shoulder Straps
himself to the pulpit with it

Looks at Jack Jr and nods him forward The Taggart pick-up
rolls toward the bus

On the pulpit Taggart has a searchlight of his own It finds
the concaved roof of the bus and its smashed rear

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Jack Jr slams on the brakes quickly Works his spotlight to
reveal Kimball’s body in the middle of the road Face down
Hair blowing in the night breeze

Minxie lowers her eyes Won’t look

Taggart motions for Jack Jr to go around

RAKING ANGLE TOWARD SIDE OF THE BUS AS TRUCK GOES BEHIND IT

The pick-up rolls onto the shoulder as the searchlight blasts
through its broken windows

A figure appears suddenly in one

caggart swin 5 around swiftly in the pulpit MAKING A RUSTY
PING SOU

Jonny Young stares back into the glare of the spotlights
Battered but alive Stares with wide eyes at the vicious
homemade harpoon pointing up at him

From the small cannon attached to the pulpit A cannon
fashioned out of the post puncher mechanism from the Taggart
arm

Taggart stares down at the frightened boy from the sites of
this crudely fashioned weapon

TAGGART
(lowering his sites)
You alright

MINXIE
His name is Jonny

TAGGART
Jonny you alright

Jonny nods his head Taggart calls down to Minxie

TAGGART
Which way did the rest head
off

MINXIE
Everywhere The truck went
that away

Taggart stares down the dark two-lane
EXT CEMENT FACTORY NIGHT SAME TIME
Rhonda Izzy and Double D stop at a long much weathered

cyclone fence But it is what they see past it that gets
their attention

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Two dark silos stretch high into the night sky Flanking
smaller flatter buildings in this gloomy abandoned compound
Faded legends on them

Kissel Rock and Gravel

DOUBLE D
I don’t believe it we found
some place

RHONDA
Yeah no place

IZZY
Maybe we should hold out for
some place scarier You
know more dead looking I’m
sure we could find it if we
really put our minds to it

Double D spots something now

DOUBLE D
Fuck

Stares ahead through the mesh of the fence at the pick-up
parked in the distant shadows between the two silos

This is the truck that raced away from the bus Once filled
beyond capacity with escapees and now empty

DOUBLE D
Is that the truck I think it
is

RHONDA
Oh my God

Double D jumps on the fence and starts to scale it Izzy
joins him

EXT CEMENT FACTORY SILO AREA NIGHT SAME TIME
ANGLE FROM BEHIND THE TOP OF ONE SILO

The two boys scale the fence and Rhonda follows At this
distance their voices slap echo off the concrete city ahead
of them

DOUBLE D
If that’s them they didn’t
get very far

The three hop down on the other side of the fence Make their
cautious way across the overgrown field

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

IZZY
What the fuck are they doing
here They were s’possed to

go get help

RHONDA
Maybe they had to go for
cover

Slowing now Can see it is empty and badly damaged

DOUBLE D
If they did I have a feeling
they never made it

What remains of the driver’s window is shattered and the door
has a vicious deep scrape across it The hood is buckled and
a hideous hole has been ripped right over the driver seat

DOUBLE D
(peers in the window)
Keys are in it

Looks back at Izzy just as his hand reaches out and pulls at
Double D’s shirt Can barely get out a whisper
IZZY
Sweet Jesus God Howdy-do
Rhonda and Double D turn to see

The Ice Cream truck parked back in the deep shadows beyond
the pick-up

RHONDA
What in the fuck

A MURDER OF CROWS VAULTS OFF THE DOME OF THE CLOSEST SILO AND
FLUTTER INTO THE NIGHT

Double D has drawn his flare gun Startled they stare up
--watching the birds disperse against the moonlit clouds

RHONDA
We gotta get the Hell outta
here

Suddenly they are in shadow A great vast shadow that climbs
the silo almost swallowing it and vanishes again

They all whirl around Up at the distant moon Has something
just crossed it

IZZY
No we gotta get the Hell

Double D is already on his way to the nearest silo door

He tries it as quietly as possible Then leans against it
with all his weight Can hear rotting wood start to give way

KEEE-RAAAAA More rotting wood crumbling The door is
bending in now

The giant shadow wings across the yard in the other direction
now

The other two inspired by this to help push against the
door Eyes skyward

INT CEMENT FACTORY SILO NIGHT SAME TIME

THUNK The door flies open Moonlight floods into total
darkness

Double D’s silhouette fills the doorway then Izzy and Rhonda
as they crowd in and close the door behind them

Silence for a long moment Waiting to hear Tiny whispers

RHONDA
What is that smell

IZZY
Jesus look up

The top of the dome has a gaping hole You can see through it
into the night sky Moonlight raking in

Minxie remember A big
cement tunnel

(off their looks)
She saw it in her dream and
she said it was-

Izzy checks himself He remembers what she said now

RHONDA
Oh Christ A big cement
tunnel where it stored all
jts-

A sudden flutter of great wings and it perches on the dome
high above them Staring in the gaping hole

The four kids back against the wall Holding their breath
Trickles of dust and dirt fall from high above

Rhonda grabs Izzy’s hand Holds it tight Izzy might almost
grab Double D’s but curls it into a fist instead

To his surprise Double D grabs his fist Holds it

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

THE LARGE WINGS FLAP AGAIN AS THE CREEPER LEAPS BACK INTO THE
SKY -BUT NOT BEFORE DROPPING SOMETHING

Something large Plummeting the length of the silo Coming
straight at them

The kids flail back to get away from it as-

WHAM It slams brutally onto the silo floor Rolls right up
to their feet It has an arm Double D kicks it away in a
horrible frenzy

DOUBLE D
What the fuck was that

RHONDA
I don’t wanna know

IZZY
Oh Jesus

They all peer ahead into the darkness
IZZY

Can’t see anything my eyes
haven’t adjusted

DOUBLE D
Whatever it is it’s moving
IZZY

Moving right fucking at us--

Izzy screams Something has his pant leg And in a sliver of
moonlight -all can see that is a pale and bloodied Braddock
Clutching Izzy’s leg Shirt gone pants ragged

RHONDA
(can barely get the words out)
Scotty

She falls to her knees staring into his eyes Braddock’s
mouth opens but no words come out

Double D Caught in a horrible stare with Scott Not even
seeing what Izzy is seeing as his eyes adjust even more

IZZY
Oh Jesus

The silo floor is littered with bodies Some wrapped roped
and stacked others not like the more recent acquisitions of
Coach Hanna and Bus Driver Betty

IZZY
Rhonda

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

She isn’t listening

SLOW PUSH IN ON Double D locked into Braddock’s pathetic
death-like stare

IZZY
(in his own daze)
D’ D’ are you seeing this

But Double D is transfixed on Braddock And the open hole at
the small of his back -where something has been removed

IZZY
Come on

But Rhonda doesn’t move Braddock either Caught staring at
Braddock’s chalky face as it stares up

Izzy noticing now that even the silo walls are lined with
hanging bodies Watches as one of them Coach Barnes is hit
by another trickle of dust from far above

Izzy wants to look up Does so slowly he hopes it won’t be
noticed At the top of the dome --the Creeper slowly edges
up to the hole and peers down

IZZY

Izzy and races out of the silo as Rhonda and Double D Look
up
The hole in the top of the dome is filled with movement as

they see the Creeper leaping down the length of the silo
toward them -its wings opening up to soften his landing

The Creature hits the floor just as Rhonda and Double D race
out the door

EXT CEMENT FACTORY NIGHT SAME TIME

The three kids sprint toward the Pick-up truck Izzy is the
first inside Turning the key madly as Rhonda and Double D
squeeze into the cab next to him

IZZY
You see him

DOUBLE D
Just get the fuck outta
here

The silo door bursts open and the Creeper leaps out -his
massive wing span expanding the instant he is out the door

RHONDA
GO00

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Izzy gets the engine started just as the Creeper crouches and
leaps from the ground directly at the truck

The old truck blasts away just as the Creeper comes down It
leaps again -this time directly into the back of the truck

Double D Takes his flare gun out and hangs out the passenger
window trying to get a shot at him

CLICK the gun doesn’t fire Double D Panics and aims
again as the Creature advances toward him--

SKEE--EEOOOSSSHHHH SOMETHING ROCKETS INTO THE CREEPER SO
FAST AND SO HARD -IT SENDS IT FLYING OUT OF THE TRUCK INTO
THE AIR IN A WHIRLING MASS OF WINGS AND LIMBS

Double D cannot believe his eyes Looks down at the flare
gun --he didn’t even fire it

The Creeper somersaults higher and higher until THWONK The
cable that is now attached to it runs out of slack abruptly
halting it

THE CREEPER WAILS Looking down with wide eyes at ONE OF
TAGGART’S HOMEMADE HARPOONS THAT HAS SKEWERED HIM THROUGH THE
STOMACH

A long cable attached to the spear leads back to

The Taggart truck blasting across the field from the two-
lane Taggart in the truck bed strapped to his post puncher
Taking up the slack on the cable by turning a large hand
crank at its spool

The truck smashes through the plant’s cyclone fence and into
the yard Braking to a halt with a determined Jack Jrbehind
the wheel Minxie Jonny and the dog crammed in there with
him

The Creeper doesn’t know what to make of it Soars to a
higher altitude still tethered

Izzy Rhonda and Double D screech to a halt at the far end
of the lot Staring at the impossibility of a crazy man in a
pick-up truck who has just harpooned this Creature

The Creature grabs the metal spear and yanks on it Glares
down the cable at the distant truck and takes off higher into
the sky

The hand crank spins as cable flies off the spool again
Until it runs out Knotted at the end to stay there

The Creeper’s ascension is again abruptly stopped

IT WAILS DOWN AT THEM -TALONS CLUTCHING THE HARPOON TAKES
OFF AGAIN TO FLY HIGHER

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

BRANK The pick-up is yanked forward -the chassis starting
to lift off its wheels

TAGGART
Hold on

BRANK The truck rocks viciously as the Creeper tries again
to ascend

Jack Jr standing on the brake but the vehicle is still
dragged in small juts across the earth

Minxie and Jonny clutching the dash Taggart rocking in his
harness

Watching the Creeper soar horizontally now Back and forth
It looks like some demonic kite tethered by the cable as it
streaks across the moonlit sky

Taggart trying to reel him in again The handle won’t turn
easily Then not at all

The Creeper WAILS wings Flapping as it hovers -a tiny distant
speck at the end of the cable

Rhonda Double D and Izy in the other truck -watching the
sky through the hole in the roof

ANOTHER WAIL and the distant cable slackens Taggart can see it

dropping down -and knows in a heartbeat what is coming
TAGGART
GET QUT JACKY GET OUTTA
THERE
The homemade harpoon rockets back at them
Minxie leaps out of the cab as Jack Jr drags the dog out
nis side Taggart struggling to unhook himself from the
arness

Jonny struggling to move himself Jack Jr pulls hard on him
drags him out the driverside just as--

--KEE-RASSHHHHH THE SPEAR PIERCES THE WINDSHIELD AND
STABS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BACK SEAT

Jonny and Jack Jr hit the ground hard Taggart stumbles back
to his feet Stares up at the winged beast and sees it drop

Jack Jr on the ground with Jonny

JACK JR

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

Taggart works fast In a panic hits a lever with his foot
that ejects the first spool of cable --and slams another
spool into the pulpit

TAGGART
Get back all of you

THE BEAST WAILS -A HORRIBLE SOUND THAT TEARS ACROSS THE
NIGHT Taggart stares skyward as

The Creeper is diving right for them
Taggart scrambling for another harpoon

The Creeper’s wings narrowed at his sides It is like a
missile

138 art slides the spear into the cannon It will only go in
way Stuck

The Creeper spearheading toward the old pick-up

Taggart panicking Drags the harpoon out Grabs another one
The Creeper’s arms bend Talons ready for Taggart

Taggart slides the new spear into the cannon

The Creeper’s face opens WAILING its attack

CLANK Taggart clips the cable from the new spool to the
spear

Can see those horrible eyes taking a bead on him--

faggart swings the cannon up and KEE-OOOSHHHH The harpoon
ires

THA-WACKKK THE CREEPER TAKES THIS ONE HEAD ON AND IT HURLS
HIM BACKWARDS AT A TERRIFYING VELOCITY

The cable unspools wildly from the pulpit The Creeper a
tumbling tangle of limbs and wings until-

KA-BLAM THE CREATURE SLAMS AGAINST THE SILO WALL HIGH ABOVE
THE GROUND

Pieces of concrete crumbling and falling it hits so hard

It hangs there stunned as it looks down --this harpoon has
gone right through its chest Pinning him to the stone wall
of the silo

Double D Izzy and Rhonda staring up at the winged demon

Minx’

But Minxie only has a concerned look for her
TAGGART
Get those kids the Hell
outta here

Jack Jr lifts Jonny Minxie helps drag him toward Izzy and
the pick up

Izzy turns the old truck around and heads for them Double D
hops out to help lay Jonny in the back of Izzy’s pick up

High above them the Creeper turns its head and glares down

DIRECTLY AT DOUBLE D WAILS SUDDENLY YANKING ON THAT SPEAR
WITH NEW MOTIVATION

DOUBLE D
(to Izzy)
Come on man
IZZY
Minxie get your ass in

here

But Minxie doesn’t move SHH-THWOCK A powerful yank on the
harpoon in the Creeper’s chest --it starts to come out

TAGGART
Can’t let him get that out

Taggart hits the foot lever that tosses that spool out of the
truck Loads in another

TAGGART
Jack Jr Move this thing

Jack Jr can’t believe his dad wants him back in the truck

TAGGART
NOW TAKE ME RIGHT AT IT

Jack Jr sprints back to the truck and into the cab Breaking
the shattered windshield glass that obscures his view

Taggart scrambles for another harpoon
SHH-THWOCK The Creeper yanks the spear out another foot

SHH-THWOCK THE SPEAR IS YANKED AGAIN AS IT WAILS IN AGONY
It is almost out of it’s chest

Like A Bat Out of Hell Jeepers Creepers II 21602

IZZY
MINXIE COME ON

Jack Jr rolls the Taggart truck toward the silo as his dad
shoves another spear into the post puncher

Taggart takes a bead The WAILING Creeper just pulling the
last agonizing foot of harpoon out of its flesh

KEE-OOOSHHHH The harpoon sails out of the canon Rocks
the pick-up as it launches toward the silo

The Creeper pulls the spear free of his chest WAILS LOUDLY
JUST AS--

KA-RACKKK THE SECOND ONE GETS HIM DEAD CENTER AGAIN SENDS
HIM BLASTING THROUGH THE WALL OF THE SILO AND PLUMMETING
INSIDE

The cable falling with it The crank of the spool spins
wildly and then stops abruptly with A LARGE THUD FROM INSIDE

The Creeper has hit bottom and hard

Jack Jr brakes again Leaps out of the cab Dad is slumped
over the pulpit Is he hurt or sobbing He unsnaps his
harness and slides to the bottom of the truck bed

Izzy revs the engine of the battered pick-up Double D In
the truck bed tending to Jonny

DOUBLE D
Minxie

But Minxie’s expression is blank She is staring at the hole
in the silo and the cable that runs into it

That cable is moving ever so slightly

MINXIE
(calls across to jaggart)
I told you it doesn’
matter what you do to it

Taggart looks over at her

MINXIE

Twenty-three years from now
And then twenty-three years
from then

Taggart looks at her

MINXIE
You can’t stop it

The cable snaps to the top of the hole in the silo wall -and
keeps going Slicing through the old stone on its way toward
the dome

DOUBLE D
GO IZZY

(shouting)

It doesn’t matter
The cable cutting upward through the stone until--
BASSSHHH THE CREEPER ERUPTS FROM THE TOP OF THE SILO -

Izzy’s not waiting anymore -he gases the engine and they
lurch toward the two-lane

The cable flying off the spool as the Creeper rockets over and
past him -after the fleeing pick-up

TAGGART
JACKY GET BACK

The Creeper closes it eyes stretches its arms out and-

KARR-RANNGGG THE CABLE RUNS OUT AND THE TAGGART TRUCK IS
RIPPED BY A JOLT SO POWERFUL IT FLIPS OVER AND ROLLS

KA-RANG KA-RANG Jack Jr and Minxie watch in horror Jonny
and Double D in the pick-up bed see it still rolling as
they blast onto the two-lane

CREEPER CLANGS NOISILY ONTO THE ASPHALT--

Come on man We’re sitting
ducks back here

IZZY
(hollers back)
I have the pedal to the
metal

Jonny grabs Double D’s pant leg Whirls him around The dark
road behind them Looks empty at first

Then something flies in and out of a pool of light of a
passing billboard

The Creeper is swooping down the two-lane at car level -in
hot pursuit of them
