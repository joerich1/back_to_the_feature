TANNER DRIFTWOOD 30s band-aid over his bruised and half-
broken nose is behind the wheel Tanner is driving way
too fast and doesn’t have time for introductions right now
He’s focused on the road and all in all he’s not doing
that great

JAMIE DEMONE female 20s sporting a black eye short hair
and tattoos rides shotgun She screams the directions while
gripping the handle for support Jamie has a tendency to make
the wrong choices And is a magnet for trouble A big magnet

And the van screeches to a halt tires smoking The van backs
up and skids to a halt at the curb
INT VAN

Tanner turns off the engine and cleans the dash stuffs a few
things in the glove box and tries to close it

It doesn’t work Again nothing Again nope
JAMIE

express service Deal with your OCD

They get out of the van

EXT VAN

Tanner and Jamie open the trunk and unload the equipment On
the side of the van “247 Xpress Cleaning” painted graffiti
style

They hurry to the door dropping and picking up equipment as
they approach

EXT TOWNHOUSE

Jamie rings the bell Tanner turns and eyes the van
TANNER
I’1ll be right back Need to check
if I locked the van

JAMIE
You locked the van

TANNER
I need to check

JAMIE
Nobody is gonna steal the shitty
shitty bang van

Tanner sprints to the van

JAMIE
CHECK THE WINDOW I think you left
it open you idiot

Jamie blows a bubble It pops as the door opens to reveal
LITTLE JOE (30s) He was born in Albania but his accent is
almost gone Whoever nicknamed him Little Joe was being
ironic

His 250 pounds of fat block the door He stares at Jamie and
her black eye

JAMIE
Are you gonna stare at me all day
long or you want me to do the job

He moves away and she invites herself in

INT TOWNHOUSE - FOYER - DAY

Jamie takes in the luminous classic Georgian style Little
Joe closes the door

JAMIE

Just leave it open My partner
forgot something in the van

EXT STREET - DAY
Tanner checks the van it’s locked
In the driveway in a flash-like effect he subconsciously

reads the license plates of every vehicle He stops on a
black SUV Just the car he’d like to have
Tanner reads the tacky plaque that hangs from the mirror It
says “Li’l Joe” Then

THE LICENSE PLATE 34G FL8

The alarm of the SUV goes off Tanner flees as if he had been
caught red-handed

INT HALLWAY

Jamie and Little Joe walk as the alarm blares in the bg

LITTLE JOE
I gotta fix that alarm

But he makes no move to do so Instead he opens the door --

INT TOWNHOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

And ushers Jamie in There’s a table over a rug two black
briefcases sit on top of it He approaches and points at the
floor Jamie blows another bubble

LITTLE JOE
It’s right here

Jamies eyes pop open Her gum snaps She turns her head to
look at Little Joe Then she looks back at the floor

A DEAD BODY Surrounded by a pool of blood Jamie looks at
the body at Little Joe Body Little Joe Little Joe body

JAMIE
Where are the -- cops
LITTLE JOE

The cops They’re not coming
That’s the point

JAMIE
There’s a dead body there

LITTLE JOE
No shit that’s why I called you
Look the ad says
(picks up phone reads)
“We clean what nobody wants to
clean and express” Express
spelled with just an X
JAMIE
I know how the fuck it’s spelled
But that doesn’t include a stiff
We’re a domestic cleaning service

She takes a breath trying to calm down Doesn’t really work

JAMIE
Look we don’t want to be
accomplices in this This

Tanner walks in A piece of furniture blocks the body

TANNER
I followed the voices
(offers hand)
Tanner-—

Little Joe notices his nose Then looks at Jamie’s eye

LITTLE JOE
Joe What the fuck happened to you
two

Tanner steps forward and sees the body The alarm in the bg
stops

Complete silence Tanner starts to hyperventilate as his eyes
slide to Jamie puzzled

TANNER
Wha-wha -- what are we doing here
Did you tell him we’d do this

JAMIE
Of course not Are you out of your
mind

Little Joe observes the conversation looking right left
right just like a ping-pong game

TANNER
You just got out of jail For all I
know you could be his accomplice
Or the perpetrator

JAMIE
Are you some sort of retard

TANNER
Excuse me but I don’t want to be
involved in a fucking murder And
last time you said you weren’t
involved you ended up in jail
Little Joe silently walks backwards eyeing the two suitcases
by the door

JAMIE
Neither do I

She whispers hoping Little Joe can’t hear them

JAMIE
All we have to do is call the cops
Were obviously not involved in
anything

Little Joe’s POV - the conversation fades as he grabs the
suitcases

Jamie sneezes Her DNA is now all over the scene Tanner
realizes this as well

JAMIE
Shit There’s a dog in here

A POMERANIAN walks in It yaps and steps into the blood Yaps
again And again Tanner and Jamie stare at the dog which is
now licking his owner’s blood and face

Tanner looks disgusted at the dog and realizes he’s also
stepped in the blood Lifts his shoe out of it He blinks
trying to stand still as his body sways back and forth

The alarm goes off again and Little Joe sprints out as fast
as a big fat turtle With the two suitcases

Jamie looks at him “running” away and he gets stuck in the
door with the two suitcases

Jamie can’t believe that the guy is trying to lose them But
he finally makes it through the door Jamie runs after him
but right then

Tanner faints hits his half-broken nose (now fully broken)
against the table and falls next to the body Jamie stops
and turns around

JAMIE
You gotta be fucking kidding me

Tanner’s blood is pooling into the other dead body’s blood
Yap yap

ACT THREE

INT SUSAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Susan Tanner and Jamie at the table Jamie opens a bottle
wine

SUSAN
What are we celebrating that I’m
leaving

JAMIE

(grinning)
I got a job

SUSAN
Oh my god I can’t believe those
words I’m so proud of you

JAMIE
Yep The new J is here You’re
gonna be my 1i’l sister now I’11l
take care of you
Tanner feels small Stung A light jealousy attack

TANNER
We Will Both

SUSAN
I never thought I would hear that

Susan raises her glass for a toast

JAMIE
To --

SUSAN
The grown ups Finally Stay out of
trouble while I’m away please
It’s just five days

The glasses clink

EXT WOMEN’S CLOTHING STORE - DAY

Through the glass Jamie attends to MRS GARRICK She’s an
attractive woman in her 40s Just a tiny bit old fashioned

INT WOMENS CLOTHING STORE

It’s a high-end and tastefully decorated place Mrs Garrick
spins in front of the mirror checking her new dress Jamie
attends with until now unknown excellent manners

JAMIE
I think it looks great It fits
like a glove

MRS GARRICK
I don’t know I can’t think
straight

Mrs Garrick sighs She’s angry and hurt She looks straight
into Jamie’s eyes

MRS GARRICK
I think my husband is having an
affair

JAMIE
Ouch I’m sorry

MRS GARRICK
She’s his partner’s girlfriend A
young hottie

JAMIE
Oh That’s a ticking bomb
(beat)
Can I ask you something

MRS GARRICK
Sure

JAMIE
Is he rich

MRS TREMAINE
Id say he’s wealthy yes

JAMIE

And -- are you in love with him
What I mean is do you want to
fight for your marriage or --

(long beat)
Do you do want to crush him and
take his money And his house and
his car of course

MRS GARRICK
-- I have no idea I haven’t
thought about that Why

JAMIE
Well men can’t be fully trusted
But they can be controlled Now if
you want to crush him Id wear
something like this

Jamie walks to an outfit and shows it to her It does show
more skin Mrs Garrick is used to

JAMIE
This shows a woman with self-
confidence Now if you’re in love
and want him back this could be
too much Nobody likes easy things
And routine could lead him to
mistake confidence for desperation

Mrs Garrick looks at the outfit then at Jamie

MRS GARRICK
And we don’t want that right

JAMIE
Never Now for a man who doesn’t
know you this will attract his
eye but he still has to test the
waters You follow me

Jamie grabs another outfit Mrs Garrick listens as if she
were listening to Buddha himself

JAMIE
Remember short enough to let them
dream but long enough to keep them
dreaming

Mrs Garrick takes the outfit and drapes it over what she’s
wearing looking at her new self in the mirror

MRS GARRICK
I think I’m going with the crush
plan

JAMIE
Excellent choice

Mrs Garrick’s reflection smiling She likes her new self

Garrick

MRS GARRICK

He opens a drawer with a stack of cards Jamie takes one
crosses the previous name and writes JAMIE on top of it

JAMIE
There you go

She looks at Mr Sullivan and corrects herself

JAMIE
I mean have a wonderful evening

MRS GARRICK

As Mrs Garrick walks out Beatrix walks in Mr Sullivan can
already smell trouble And the smoke of her cigarette Jamie
walks to her as fast as she can without being too obvious

JAMIE
Hi good afternoon I’m sorry you
can’t smoke in here

Beatrix blows the smoke in Jamie’s face Jamie’s real self
surfaces but she hides it with a wide smile

JAMIE
(hushing)
What the fuck are you doing here

Mr Sullivan comes and offers an ashtray

MR SULLIVAN

Beatrix puts her cigarette out

BEATRIX

Jamie turns and walks back to the store Beatrix grabs her by
the arm spins her around and punches Jamie in her black eye
Beatrix produces a butterfly knife

Puts it on Jamie’s neck The knife sticks to her neck

BEATRIX
We want our money Two weeks Are

JAMIE

The butterfly knife knicks the skin and a trickle of blood
runs down Jamie’s neck

BEATRIX
Yes or no A single syllable You

JAMIE
Yes

BEATRIX
Fifteen days I’ll give you an
extra one ‘Cause we’re pals

Mr Sullivan hangs the “Help Wanted” sign as Beatrix rides
out of the frame

I never thought I’d say this --

TANNER
We’re not working together

Jamie grabs her cell phone

JAMIE

JAMIE
You didn’t take the money

Tanner shakes his head
JAMIE
Oh my god You’re useless That’s

Jamie clenches her fist but closes her eyes and breathes in
trying to remember whatever she’s learned about Zen culture

JAMIE
I promised my sister I’d stay out
of trouble So just open the van

Tanner taps his pockets Can’t find the keys

JAMIE

Can you open the damn van

breathes out and keeps cool for a bit longer

Walks to Tanner’s window

JAMIE
I’m taking the business side

TANNER
Youre not taking anything you’re
a psychopath

She punches him in the nose Ouch

That breaks the van’s window

INT HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

BUCK RILEY late 40s If you dressed up like a gangster for
Halloween youd be Buck His back leans against the door as
he adjusts his tie real tight And I mean real tight

A closer looks reveals that the tie is actually not Buck’s
It comes through the door’s frame

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

Because it belongs to a MAN whose face is smashed against
the door as his tie strangles him The tie disappears through
the door’s frame --

BACK AT THE OTHER SIDE

As Buck continues to tighten it while checking his watch
impatiently

BUCK
Where the fuck is Billy

Muffled words come from the other side of the door
BUCK
Can’t understand a word you’re
saying Just shut up

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

The Man tries to produce words But his face is too white to
have much blood left

BACK AT BUCK

Keeps checking the watch Finally lets the tie go

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

The tie comes loose so the Man gets free falls to the
ground gasping for air The door opens revealing Buck

BUCK
Must be your lucky day My partner
should’ve been here an hour ago
And I don’t like my shoes to get
dirty unless it’s strictly
necessary You know what I mean

Man shakes his head

BUCK
I mean that since he’s not here to
clean your brains when I splatter
them on the wall you get to live
one more week

MAN
THANKS

BUCK
The money plus ten per cent in
seven days Six I never miss a
game Don’t do anything stupid
Again

The Man nods Bucks tweaks his hair and tie and walks out

INT TOWNHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

From Tanner and Jamie’s perspective now as Little Joe
silently walks backwards eyeing the two suitcases next to the
door

TANNER
For what I know you could be his
accomplice Or the perpetrator

JAMIE
Are you some sort of retard

TANNER
Excuse me but I don’t want to be
involved in a fucking murder And
last time you said you weren’t
involved you ended up in jail

JAMIE
Of course I was involved

TANNER
Ha I knew it

Jamie sneezes over the body Her DNA all over the scene

JAMIE
Shit There’s a dog in here

A POMERANIAN walks in It yaps and steps into the blood

Tanner looks disgusted at the dog and realizes he’s also
stepped in the blood Lifts his shoe out of it

The alarm goes off and Little Joe sprints out with the two
suitcases gets stuck in the door He makes it through and
Jamie runs after him but right then

Tanner faints hits his half-broken nose (now fully broken)
against the table and falls next to the body Jamie stops
and turns around

TANNER
DEAL

Buck laughs It’s a deal He dials and talks into his phone
BUCK
Hey I need you to run me a plate
I need the address

EXT LITTLE JOE’S HOUSE - DAY

Little Joe’s black SUV parked on the street The plaque
hanging from the rearview mirror

The license plate 34G FL8

INT LITTLE JOE’S OFFICE - DAY

Little Joe stands staring at the two briefcases on a table
Also his gun is next to them Right behind him a couch

Little Joe opens one of the suitcases whose content we can’t
see His eyes pop open with a smile
INT CAR

Buck drives by Little Joe’s SUV Checks the rearview mirror
Jamie and Tanner drive their van

Buck parks his black sedan next to it and the alarm goes off

INT LITTLE JOE’S OFFICE
Little Joe curses in Gheg (Spoken by Albanians)
LITTLE JOE

(English sub)
Fucking alarm

He opens the other briefcase His eyes go anime wide

The briefcases covers his face but we see him when he goes
from one to the other Again And again

LITTLE JOE
(English sub)
Ha I’m rich

BUCK (0S)
(walking in)
The fuck did you say

Buck’s gun pointing at Little Joe who eyes his gun

BUCK
I wouldn’t do that
(to Tanner and Jamie)
Is this stuffed croissant the one

Tanner and Jamie nod mute

BUCK
Where’s the dough Slowly

Little Joe spins one of the briefcases It’s full of cash
With the gun Buck motions at the other briefcase

BUCK
Is that the smack
(off Joe nods)
Lemme see it

Little Joe spins the briefcase The heroin is there

BUCK
Good Now sit your ass

EXT LITTLE JOE’S HOUSE

TWO KIDS walk by Little Joe’s SUV The alarm goes off

INT LITTLE JOE’S HOUSE

Distracting Buck for a second Little Joe steps back taking
his gun as he plunges into the couch with a bang He shoots
at Buck through one of the open briefcases piercing its
cover

The bullet skims Buck who shoots at Little Joe through the
other open suitcase piercing it before the bullet finally
impacts Little Joe’s forehead

THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE SUITCASE

A perfect hole in Little Joe’s head His brains on the wall

EXT LITTLE JOE’S HOUSE
The kids look at the car confused

KID
That’s a fucking loud ass alarm

They laugh and walk away

INT LITTLE JOE’S HOUSE
Tanner spins to avoid looking at the blood
BUCK
Don’t look at me like that He shot
first
Buck weighs the situation for a bit Then speaks to Jamie
BUCK
Take another five grand and clean

that mess

TANNER
We don’t clean bodies for the mob

BUCK
Of course you do Or do you want to
be accomplices in a murder

Buck’s phone rings Jamie’s brain switching gears now

BUCK
Excuse me

He walks away for privacy Jamie and Tanner whisper

JAMIE
It can actually be an opportunity

TANNER
An opportunity He’s a criminal A
fucking hitman

JAMIE
Exactly We better do what he says
TANNER
No fucking way

JAMIE
You could pay Susan’s loan

This hits Tanner who thinks about it
after all

TANNER
Fuck But Just this one

JAMIE

Maybe there’s a way

Sure just this one What’s next

What do I do

TANNER

You mean you don’t know How did

you clean the other scene

JAMIE
Bleach I think

TANNER

Bleach Which one Please tell me
you used the big plain bottle

(off Jamie shaking no)

Oh my god we’re so fucked We’re

so FUCKED

JAMIE

Maybe if you hadn’t taken a nap

BUCK

SHUT UP Is it always like that

with you two
(into phone)
Yes sir Right away

They look at each other It’s kind of a yes Buck hangs up

and checks Little Joe’s wallet

BUCK

Fuck This guy’s Albanian We

better get rid of the body

JAMIE
Then we need another five

BUCK

I think I’m falling in love with

this girl

Buck walks to the suitcase takes the money counts it

TANNER
Have you lost your mind

JAMIE
I’m not going back to prison

TANNER
This is clearly the best way to
avoid that

Buck leaves a wad on the table with a thud They go instantly
mute staring at the money

BUCK
Your cut I need to leave I’m
sorry I can’t help you Billy was
the janitor I’m just the
messenger But you guys will be
fine Right

Moves away his jacket so his gun can be seen A reminder

TANNER
Sure
(to Jamie)
Do you want to dissolve him or --
to dismember him

Jamies face suggests that she just realized what she got
into No money can be worthy this

JAMIE
Dissolve him Is this fucking
Breaking Bad

TANNER
Breaking Bad Are you kidding me
Hydrofluoric acid can’t dissolve
anything It could soften up the
tissue but if we really want to
dissolve him we need an Enzyme
solvent in a sodium hydroxide
solution at 50 And a 55-gallon--

JAMIE
How the fuck do you know that

TANNER
I told you I remember things

BUCK
Didnt I tell you little man was a
genius

JAMIE
Okay we’re not fucking dissolving
anyone What about dismembering
him

TANNER
Wed need a hatchet with a three
inch blade and we’d have to be good
at hitting the joints with a force
of 125 pounds at least And we
most likely aren’t precise So it’s
better to saw off the limbs

Jamie is now the one about to pass out
BUCK
I really need to get going By the
way do you have a card
TANNER
No we don’t because as I told

you we don’t --

JAMIE
I do actually

Tanner throws her a dagger look Jamie hands Buck the card
BUCK
Great We’ll be in touch
(looks at Little Joe)
Damn that guy is huge I should’ve
paid you double

He laughs at his joke again and walks out Jamie faces the
body Tanner stares at her avoiding looking at the blood

JAMIE
At least things can’t get worse
right Let’s do this

EXT STREET

Buck gets to his car Opens the door and looks at the
horizon Thinks for a beat then reads the card

INSERT - CARD
