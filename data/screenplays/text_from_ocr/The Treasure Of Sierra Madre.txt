taken about all the gold this here

How much do you figure weve made to

HOWARD

much

We got upwards of thirty-five thousand
apiece-and we ought to be plenty
thankful

DOBBS
Sure-lets call it quits and pack up
and leave

HOWARD
Its going to be a lot harder trip going
back than it was coming The burros
loads are heavier and accidents will be
more likely to happen on the trail
Theres always the danger of bandits
of course but added to that theres
another hazard that wasnt there
before--the Federales If we were to
meet up with them they might get kind

EXT THE TRAIL DAY

The pack train on the move Dobbs in the lead Curtin walks
like a man in a trance stumbling every so often out of
exhaustion brought on by the sleepless night

Now his eyes are actually closed He is holding on to one of
the burros packs letting the animal guide his steps
Observing this Dobbs halts and stands aside on the trail
letting the train pass Some instinct causes Curtin to open
his eyes just before coming abreast of Dobbs

CURTIN
(reaching for his
gun)
Get up there ahead of the train

Grinning Dobbs obeys
DISSOLVE TO
CAMPFIRE OFF THE TRAIL

As on the night before the two men sit a few feet apart
facing each other Curtins eyes finally begin to blink He
gets up walks back and forth Dobbs never stops looking at
him Presently Curtin sits down again It is not long
before his head drops forward Dobbs starts to crawl over to
him Curtin jerks awake and draws his gun Dobbs laughs

DOBBS
A born night watchman I have to hand
it to you You should try for a job at
a bank

Dobbs stretches out full length lies on his side looking at
Curtin Curtins eyes start blinking again Each time he
opens them it is a greater effort It is as thought heavy
weights are attached to each lid Finally they remain
closed Not that Curtin is asleep--it is simply that his
eyes need a few seconds’ rest He is determined not to go to
sleep--determined Both fists are clenched with the effort
Even after his head has dropped forward on his chest the
knuckles show white

When Curtins breathing is deep and regular Dobbs gets up
goes over to him and relieves him of his gun Then he kicks
Curtin in the ribs

DOBBS
The cards are dealt once more--another
way and this is the last time No
more shuffling
