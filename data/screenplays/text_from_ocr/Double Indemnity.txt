Office memorandum Walter Neff to
Barton Keyes Claims Manager Los
Angeles July 16th 1938 Dear Keyes
I suppose youll call this a
confession when you hear it I dont
like the word confession I just
want to set you right about one thing
you couldnt see because it was
smack up against your nose You think
youre such a hot potato as a claims
manager such a wolf on a phoney
claim Well maybe you are Keyes
but lets take a look at this
Dietrichson claim Accident and Double
Indemnity You were pretty good in
there for a while all right You
said it wasnt an accident Check
You said it wasnt suicide Check
You said it was murder Check and
double check You thought you had it
cold all wrapped up in tissue paper
with pink ribbons around it It was
perfect except that it wasnt
because you made a mistake just one
tiny little mistake When it came to
picking the killer you picked the
wrong guy if you know what I mean
Want to know who killed Dietrichson
Hold tight to that cheap cigar of
yours Keyes I killed Dietrichson

NEFF
(His voice is now
quiet and contained)

It began last May About the end of
May it was I had to run out to
Glendale to deliver a policy on some
dairy trucks On the way back I
remembered this auto renewal on Los

Feliz So I decided to run over there

It was one of those Calif Spanish
houses everyone was nuts about 10 or
15 years ago This one must have
cost somebody about 30000 bucks --
that is if he ever finished paying
for it

A-25 LIVING ROOM

Neff comes into the room and throws his briefcase on
plush davenport and tosses his hat on top of it He
around the room then moves over to a baby grand piano
a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling down one side and two
photographs standing in a staggered position on top
glances them over Mr Dietrichson age about fifty-
big blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look about
Lola Dietrichson age nineteen wearing a filmy party
and a yearning look in her pretty eyes Neff walks away
the piano and takes a few steps back and forth across

rug His eyes fall on a wrinkled corner He carefully
straightens it out with his foot His back is to the

as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase He

were closed and the sunshine coming

in through the Venetian blinds showed
up the dust in the air The furniture
was kind of corny and old-fashioned
but it had a comfortable look as if
people really sat in it On the piano
in couple of fancy frames were Mr
Dietrichson and Lola his daughter

by his first wife They had a bowl of
those little red goldfish on the
table behind the davenport but to
tell you the truth Keyes I wasnt

a whole lot interested in goldfish
right then nor in auto renewals

nor in Mr Dietrichson and his
daughter Lola I was thinking about
that dame upstairs and the way she
had looked at me and I wanted to

see her again close without that
silly staircase between us

A-26 STAIRCASE (FROM NEFFS POINT OF VIEW)

Phyllis Dietrichson is coming downstairs First we see
feet with pom-pom slippers and the gold anklet on her
ankle CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY as she descends until

his

briefcase She turns away from the mirror and sits ina
big

chair with her legs drawn up sideways the anklet now
clearly

visible

NEFF
Weve been handling this insurance
for three years for Mr Dietrichson

the anklet)

Phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her
dress

NEFF

KEYES
The little man in here

KEYES
Every time one of those phonies comes
along he ties knots in my stomach
And yours was one of them Gorlopis
Thats how I knew your claim was
crooked So what did I do I sent a
tow car out to your garage this
afternoon and they jacked up that
burned-out truck of yours And what
did they find Gorlopis They found
what was left of a pile of shavings

GORLOPIS
What shavings

KEYES
The ones you soaked with kerosene
and dropped a match on

Gorlopis cringes under the impact

He puts a

GORLOPIS

Thank you Mr Keyes
He goes out closing the door after him Keyes takes
his
cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the
flame

of a lighted match He turns to Neff

KEYES
What kind of an outfit is this anyway
Are we an insurance company or a
bunch of dimwitted amateurs writing
a policy on a mugg like that

NEFF
Wait a minute Keyes I dont rate
this beef I clipped a note to that
Gorlopis application to have him
thoroughly investigated before we
accepted the risk

KEYES
I know you did Walter Im not
beefing at you Its the company
The way they do things The way they
dont do things The way theyll
write anything just to get it down
on the sales sheet And Im the guy
that has to sit here up to my neck
in phony claims so they wont throw
more money out of the window than
they take in at the door

NEFF
(Grinning)
Okay turn the record over and lets
hear the other side

KEYES
I get darn sick of picking up after
a gang of fast-talking salesmen dumb
enough to sell life insurance to a
guy that sleeps in the same bed with
four rattlesnakes Ive had twenty-
six years of that Walter and I --

NEFF
And you loved every minute of it
Keyes You love it only you worry
about it too much you and your little
man Youre so darn conscientious
youre driving yourself crazy You
wouldnt even say today is Tuesday
without you looked at the calendar
and then you would check if it was
this years or last years calendar
and then you would find out what
company printed the calendar then
find out if their calendar checks
with the World Almanacs calendar

KEYES
Thats enough from you Walter Get
out of here before I throw my desk
at you

NEFF
I love you too

so convenient

NEFF
Thats okay I was working on my
stamp collection
She leads him toward living room
A-39 DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM
Phyllis and Neff come through archway She heads toward
low tea table which stands in front of the davenport
tall glasses ice cubes lemon a pot of tea etc
PHYLLIS

I was just fixing some iced tea
Would you like a glass
NEFF
Unless you have a bottle of beer

PHYLLIS
There might be some I never know
whats in the ice box
(Calls)
Nettie

She pours herself a glass of tea

PHYLLIS
About those renewals Mr Neff I
talked to my husband about it

NEFF
You did

PHYLLIS
Yes Hell renew with you he told
me In fact I thought hed be here
this afternoon

NEFF
But hes not

PHYLLIS
No

NEFF
Thats terrible

PHYLLIS
(Calls again
impatiently)
Nettie Nettie Oh I forgot
its the maids day off

NEFF
Dont bother Mrs Dietrichson Id
like some iced tea very much

PHYLLIS
Lemon Sugar

NEFF
Fix it your way

She fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking
around He
slowly sits down

NEFF
Seeing its the maids day off maybe
theres something I can do for you

She hands him the tea

NEFF
Like running the vacuum cleaner

PHYLLIS
Fresh

NEFF
I used to peddle vacuum cleaners
Not much money but you learn a lot
about life

PHYLLIS
I didnt think youd learned it from
a correspondence course

NEFF
Where did you pick up this tea
drinking Youre not English are
you

PHYLLIS
No Californian Born right here in
Los Angeles

NEFF
They say native Californians all
come from Iowa

PHYLLIS
I wanted to ask you something Mr
Neff

NEFF

Make it Walter

PHYLLIS
Walter

NEFF
Right

PHYLLIS

Tell me Walter on this insurance --
how much commission do you make
NEFF
wenty percent Why

fq

PHYLLIS
more business your way

NEFF
can always use it

PHYLLIS
was thinking about my husband I
worry a lot about him down in those
oil fields Its very dangerous

NEFF
Not for an executive is it

PHYLLIS
He doesnt just sit behind a desk
Hes right down there with the
drilling crews Its got me worried
sick

NEFF
You mean a crown block might fall on
him some rainy night

PHYLLIS
Please dont talk like that

NEFF
But thats the idea

PHYLLIS
The other day a casing line snapped
and caught the foreman Hes in the
hospital with a broken back

NEFF
Bad

PHYLLIS
Its got me jittery just thinking
about it Suppose something like
that happened to my husband

NEFF
It could

PHYLLIS

thought maybe I could throw a little
Dont you think he ought to have
accident insurance

NEFF
Uh huh

PHYLLIS
What kind of insurance could he have

NEFF
Enough to cover doctors and hospital
bills Say a hundred and twenty-five
a week cash benefit And hed rate
around fifty thousand capital sum

PHYLLIS
Capital sum Whats that

NEFF
Thats if he got killed Maybe I
shouldnt have said that

PHYLLIS
I suppose you have to think of
everything in your business

NEFF
Mr Dietrichson would understand
Im sure I could sell him on the
idea of some accident protection
Why dont I talk to him about it

PHYLLIS
You could try But hes pretty tough
going

NEFF

Theyre all tough at first

PHYLLIS
Hes got a lot on his mind He doesnt
want to listen to anything except
maybe a baseball game on the radio
Sometimes we sit all evening without
saying a word to each other

NEFF
Sounds pretty dull

Phyllis shrugs

PHYLLIS
So I just sit and knit

NEFF
Is that what you married him for

PHYLLIS
Maybe I like the way his thumbs hold
up the wool

NEFF
Anytime his thumbs get tired --

PHYLLIS
I want to ask you something Mr
Neff Could I get an accident policy
for him -- without bothering him at
all

NEFF
Hows that again

PHYLLIS
That would make it easier for you
too You wouldnt even have to talk
to him I have a little allowance of
my own I could pay for it and he
neednt know anything about it

NEFF
Wait a minute Why shouldnt he know

PHYLLIS
Because I know he doesnt want
accident insurance Hes superstitious
about it

NEFF
A lot of people are Funny isnt
it

PHYLLIS
If there was a way to get it like
that all the worry would be over
You see what I mean Walter

NEFF
Sure Ive got good eyesight You
want him to have the policy without
him knowing it And that means without
the insurance company knowing that
he doesnt know Thats the set-up
isnt it
PHYLLIS
Is there anything wrong with it

NEFF
I think its lovely And then some
dark wet night if that crown block
fell on him --

PHYLLIS
What crown block

NEFF
Only sometimes they have to have a
little help They cant quite make
it on their own

PHYLLIS
I dont know what youre talking
about

NEFF

Of course it doesnt have to be a
crown block It can be a car backing
over him or he can fall out of an
upstairs window Any little thing
like that as long as its a morgue
job

PHYLLIS
Are you crazy

NEFF
Not that crazy Goodbye Mrs
Dietrichson

He picks up his hat

PHYLLIS
Whats the matter

NEFF
Look baby you cant get away with
it

PHYLLIS

Get away with what

NEFF
You want to knock him off dont
you baby
PHYLLIS
Thats a horrible thing to say

NEFF

Whod you think I was anyway A guy
that walks into a good-looking dames
front parlor and says Good afternoon
I sell accident insurance on husbands
You got one thats been around too
long Somebody youd like to turn

into a little hard cash Just give

me a smile and Ill help you collect
Boy what a dope I must look to you

PHYLLIS
I think youre rotten

NEFF
I think youre swell So long as Im
not your husband

PHYLLIS

NEFF

of here baby But quick

He goes out She looks after him

So I let her have it straight between
the eyes She didnt fool me for a
minute not this time I knew I had
hold of a redhot poker and the time
to drop it was before it burned my
hand off I stopped at a drive-in
for a bottle of beer the one I had
wanted all along only I wanted it
worse now to get rid of the sour
taste of her iced tea and everything
that went with it I didnt want to

Shooting past Neff sitting behind the wheel of his car

car hop hangs a tray on the door and serves him a

beer

A-42 INT BOWLING ALLEY

Neff bowling He rolls the ball with an effort at
concentration but his mind is not really on the game

A-43 EXT APARTMENT HOUSE - (DUSK)

It is late afternoon The apartment house is called the
OLIVOS APARTMENTS It is a six-story building in the
Wilshire district with a basement garage THE CAMERA
UP the front of the building to the top floor windows

little rain starts to fall

NEFFS VOICE
(Continuing)
I didnt feel like eating dinner
when I left and I didnt feel like
a show so I drove home put the car
away and went up to my apartment

A-44 INT NEFFS APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - (DUSK)

It is a double apartment of conventional design with
dinette and bathroom squarecut overstuffed borax

furniture

Gas logs are lit in the imitation fireplace Neff
stands by

the window with his coat off and his tie loose
Raindrops

strike against the glass He turns away impatiently
paces

up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it
pulls

one out at random makes a couple of short swings
throws

the club on the couch paces again

NEFFS VOICE

(Continuing)
It had begun to rain outside and I
watched it get dark and didnt even
turn on the light That didnt help
me either I was all twisted up
inside and I was still holding on
to that red-hot poker And right
then it came over me that I hadnt
walked out on anything at all that
the hook was too strong that this
wasnt the end between her and me
It was only the beginning

The doorbell rings

NEFFS VOICE
(Continuing)
So at eight oclock the bell would
ring and I would know who it was
without even having to think as if
it was the most natural thing in the
world

Neff goes to the door and opens it

PHYLLIS
Hello

Neff just looks at her

PHYLLIS
You forgot your hat this afternoon

She has nothing in her hands but her bag

NEFF

PHYLLIS

Phyllis has moved over to the window She stares out
through
the wet window-pane

NEFF
Whats the matter now

PHYLLIS

PHYLLIS
Bourbon is fine Walter

He lets her go and moves toward the dinette
A-45 THE DINETTE AND KITCHEN
It contains a small table and some chairs A low glass-

china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen
leaving a space like a doorway The kitchen is the

apartment house kitchen with stove ice-box sink
is quite small
Neff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after
NEFF
Soda

PHYLLIS
Plain water please

NEFF
Get a couple of glasses will you

He points at the china closet He has taken a tray of
cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the
water faucet

NEFF
You know about six months ago a guy
slipped on the soap in his bathtub
and knocked himself cold and drowned
Only he had accident insurance So
they had an autopsy and she didnt
get away with it

Phyllis has the glasses now She hands them to him He
some ice cubes into the glasses

PHYLLIS
Who didnt
NEFF
His wife

He reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china
closet

NEFF
And there was another case where a
guy was found shot and his wife said
he was cleaning a gun and his stomach
got in the way All she collected
was a three-to-ten stretch in
Tehachapi

PHYLLIS
Perhaps it was worth it to her

Neff hands her a glass

NEFF
See if you can carry this as far as
the living room

They move back toward the living room
A-46 LIVING ROOM

Phyllis and Neff go toward the davenport She is
sipping her
drink and looking around

PHYLLIS
Its nice here Walter Who takes
care of it for you

NEFF
A colored woman comes in twice a
week

PHYLLIS

You get your own breakfast

NEFF
Once in a while I squeeze a
grapefruit The rest I get at the
corner drugstore

They sit on the davenport fairly close together

PHYLLIS
It sounds wonderful Just strangers
beside you You dont know them You
dont hate them You dont have to
sit across the table and smile at
him and that daughter of his every
morning of your life

NEFF
What daughter Oh that little girl
on the piano

PHYLLIS
Yes Lola She lives with us He
thinks a lot more of her than he
does of me

NEFF
Ever think of a divorce

PHYLLIS
He wouldnt give me a divorce

NEFF
I suppose because it would cost him
money

PHYLLIS
He hasnt got any money Not since
he went into the oil business

NEFF
But he had when you married him

PHYLLIS
Yes he had And I wanted a home
Why not But that wasnt the only
reason I was his wifes nurse She
was sick for a long time When she
died he was all broken up I pitied
him so

NEFF
And now you hate him

PHYLLIS

Yes Walter Hes so mean to me
Every-time I buy a dress or a pair
of shoes he yells his head off He
wont let me go anywhere He keeps
me shut up Hes always been mean to
me Even his life insurance all goes
to that daughter of his That Lola

NEFF
She takes

Nothing for you at all huh

PHYLLIS
No And nothing is just what Im
worth to him

NEFF
So you lie awake in the dark and
listen to him snore and get ideas

PHYLLIS
Walter I dont want to kill him I
never did Not even when he gets
drunk and slaps my face

NEFF
Only sometimes you wish he was dead

PHYLLIS
Perhaps I do

NEFF
And you wish it was an accident and
you had that policy For fifty
thousand dollars Is that it

PHYLLIS
Perhaps that too

a long drink

PHYLLIS

The other night we drove home from a
party He was drunk again When we
got into the garage he just sat there
with his head on the steering wheel
and the motor still running And I
thought what it would be like if I
didnt switch it off just closed

the garage door and left him there

NEFF
Ill tell you what it would be like
if you had that accident policy and
tried to pull a monoxide job We
have a guy in our office named Keyes
For him a set-up like that would be
just like a slice of rare roast beef
In three minutes hed know it wasnt
an accident In ten minutes youd be
sitting under the hot lights In
half an hour youd be signing your
name to a confession

PHYLLIS
But Walter I didnt do it Im not
going to do it

NEFF

Not if theres an insurance company
in the picture baby So long as
youre honest theyll pay you with a
smile but you just try to pull
something like that and youll find
out They know more tricks than a
carload of monkeys And if theres a
death mixed up in it you havent
got a prayer Theyll hang you as
sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar

baby
She begins to cry He puts his arms around her and
kisses
her
NEFF
Just stop thinking about it will
you
He holds her tight Their heads touch side by side

Neff sits in the swivel chair talking into the

dictaphone

He has hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit
more

comfortably As he talks a little cough shakes him now
and

then

NEFF

So we just sat there and she kept
on crying softly like the rain on
the window and we didnt say
anything Maybe she had stopped
thinking about it but I hadnt I
couldnt Because it all tied up
with something I had been thinking
DISSOLVE TO

sits
smoking
been

Crosses

about for years since long before I
ever ran into Phyllis Dietrichson
Because in this business you cant
sleep for trying to figure out the
tricks they could pull on you Youre
like the guy behind the roulette
wheel watching the customers to

make sure they dont crook the house
And then one night you get to
thinking how you could crook the
house yourself And do it smart
Because youve got that wheel right
under your hands And you know every
notch in it by heart And you figure
all you need is a plant out in front
a shill to put down the bet And
suddenly the doorbell rings and the
whole set-up is right there in the
room with you Look Keyes Im

not trying to whitewash myself I
fought it only maybe I didnt fight
it hard enough The stakes were fifty
thousand dollars but they were the
life of a man too a man whod never
done me any dirt Except he was
married to a woman he didnt care
anything about and I did

A-48 INT NEFFS APARTMENT LIVING ROOM

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY towards the davenport again Neff
in one corner with his feet on the low table He is
his cigarette and staring at the ceiling Phyllis has
sitting fairly close to him She gets up slowly and
to her rain coat lying over a chair

PHYLLIS
Ive got to go now Walter

Neff does not answer He keeps on staring at the
She starts to put the rain coat on

PHYLLIS
Will you call me Walter
Neff still does not answer

PHYLLIS
Walter

He looks at her slowly almost absently

PHYLLIS
I hate him I loathe going back to
him You believe me dont you
Walter

NEFF
Sure I believe you

PHYLLIS
I cant stand it anymore What if
they did hang me

NEFF
Youre not going to hang baby

PHYLLIS

He kisses her

NEFF
You go now

He leads her towards the door
NEFF
Call me tomorrow But not from your
house From a booth And watch your
step Every single minute Its got
to be perfect understand Straight
down the line
They have now reached the door Neff opens it Phyllis

in the doorway her lips white

PHYLLIS
Straight down the line

She goes quietly He watches her down the corridor
he closes the door and goes back into the room He
across the window and opens it wide He stands there
down into the dark street From below comes the sound
car starting and driving off The rain drifts in
face He just stands there motionless His mind is

B-1 INT NEFFS OFFICE - (NIGHT)
Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone
desk next to him stands a used record The cylinder on
dictaphone is not turning He is smoking a cigarette
kills it then lifts the needle and slides off the
which is on the machine and stands it on end on the
beside the other used record He reaches down painfully
take another record from the rack beneath the
looks at it against the light to make sure it has not
used then slides it into place on the machine and

the needle He lifts the horn and resumes his

NEFF
The first thing we had to do was fix
him up with that accident policy I
new he wouldnt buy but all I wanted
was his signature on an application
So I had to make him sign without
his knowing what he was signing And
I wanted a witness other than Phyllis
to hear me give him a sales talk I
was trying to think with your brains
eyes I wanted all the answers ready
for all the questions you were going
to spring as soon as Dietrichson was
dead

fq

Neff takes a last drag on his cigarette and kills it by
running it under the ledge of the dictaphone stand He

the stub on the floor and resumes

NEFF
A couple of nights later I went to
the house Everything looked fine
except I didnt like the witness
Phyllis had brought in It was

and

his
holds

the

Dietrichsons daughter Lola and it
made me feel a little queer in the
belly to have her right there in the
room playing Chinese checkers as
if nothing was going to happen

B-2 A BOARD OF CHINESE CHECKERS CAMERA WITHDRAWS AND
GRADUALLY REVEALS THE DIETRICHSON LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis
Lola Mr Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair His
tie are over the back of the chair and the evening
lying tumbled on the floor beside him He is smoking a

with the band on it He has a drink in front of him and
several more inside him In another chair sits Neff

briefcase on the floor leaning against his chair He
his rate book partly open with a finger in it fora
He is going full swing

NEFF
I suppose you realize Mr
Dietrichson that not being an
employee you are not covered by the
State Compensation Insurance Act
The only way you can protect yourself
is by having a personal policy of
your own

DIETRICHSON
I know all about that The next thing
youll tell me I need earthquake
insurance and lightning insurance
and hail insurance

Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on
dialogue Lola listens without much interest
PHYLLIS
(To Dietrichson)

If we bought all the insurance they
can think up wed stay broke paying
for it wouldnt we honey

DIETRICHSON
What keeps us broke is you going out
and buying five hats at a crack Who
needs a hat in California

NEFF
I always say insurance is a lot like
a hot water bottle It looks kind of
useless and silly hanging on the
hook but when you get that stomach
ache in the middle of the night it
comes in mighty handy

DIETRICHSON
Now you want to sell me a hot water
bottle

NEFF

Dollar for dollar accident insurance
is the cheapest coverage you can
buy Mr Dietrichson

DIETRICHSON
Maybe some other time Mr Neff I
had a tough day

NEFF
Just as you say Mr Dietrichson

DIETRICHSON
Suppose we just settle that automobile
insurance tonight

NEFF
Sure All we need on that is for you
to sign an application for renewal

Phyllis throws a quick glance at Neff As she looks
back she
sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch

LOLA
Phyllis do you mind if we dont
finish this game It bores me stiff

PHYLLIS
Got some thing better to do

LOLA
Yes I have
She gets up

LOLA
(To Dietrichson)

She goes out through the archway

DIETRICHSON
A great little fighter for her weight

Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink

Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase He
puts

the briefcase on Mr Dietrichsons lap and lays the
forms on

top Phyllis is watching closely

NEFF
This is where you sign Mr
Dietrichson

DIETRICHSON

NEFF
The applications for your auto
renewals So youll be protected
until the new policies are issued

DIETRICHSON

NEFF

DIETRICHSON
Just so Im covered when I drive up
North

Neff takes out his fountain pen

NEFF

DIETRICHSON

PHYLLIS
He was a Stanford man Mr Neff And
he still goes to his class reunion

DIETRICHSON

NEFF
Great football school Stanford Did

DIETRICHSON
Left guard Almost made the varsity

Neff has unscrewed his fountain pen He hands it to Mr
Dietrichson Dietrichson puts on his glasses

NEFF
On that bottom line Mr Dietrichson

Dietrichson signs Neffs and Phyllis eyes meet for a
split
second

NEFF
Both copies please

He withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the
signature line on the supposed duplicate

DIETRICHSON
Sign twice huh

NEFF
One is the agents copy I need it
for my files

DIETRICHSON
(In a mutter)
Files Duplicates Triplicates

Dietrichson grunts and signs again Again Neff and
Phyllis
exchange a quick glance

NEFF
No hurry about the check Mr
Dietrichson I can pick it up at
your office some morning

Casually Neff lifts the briefcase and signed
applications
off Dietrichsons lap

DIETRICHSON
How much you taking me for

NEFF
One forty-seven fifty Mr
Dietrichson

Dietrichson stands up He is about Neffs height but a

little
heavier
PHYLLIS
I guess thats enough insurance for
one evening Mr Neff
DIETRICHSON
Plenty
Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass
He
tries the siphon but it is empty He gathers up his
coat and
tie and picks up his glass
DIETRICHSON
Good night Mr Neff
Neff is zipping up his briefcase
NEFF
Good night Mr Dietrichson Good
night Mrs Dietrichson
DIETRICHSON
Bring me some soda when you come up
Phyllis
Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway
PHYLLIS
(To Neff)
I think you left your hat in the
hall
Phyllis leads the way and Neff goes after her his
briefcase

under his arm

B-3 HALLWAY DIETRICHSON RESIDENCE - (NIGHT)
Phyllis enters through the living room archway with

Neff
behind her She leads him towards the door On the way
he
picks up his hat In the BACKGROUND Dietrichson begins
to
ascend the stairs carrying his coat and glass Phyllis
and
Neff move close to the door They speak in very low
voices
PHYLLIS
All right Walter
NEFF
Fine
PHYLLIS
He signed it didnt he
NEFF
Sure he signed it You saw him
Phyllis opens the door a crack Both look at the
stairs
where Dietrichson is going up Phyllis takes her hand
off
the doorknob and holds on to Neffs arm
NEFF
(Looking up)
Watch it will you
Phyllis slowly drops her hand from his arm Both look
up as

Dietrichson goes across the balcony and out of sight

NEFF
Listen That trip to Palo Alto When
does he go

PHYLLIS
End of the month

NEFF
He drives huh

PHYLLIS
He always drives

NEFF
Not this time Youre going to make
him take the train

PHYLLIS
Why

NEFF
Because its all worked out for a
train

For a second they stand listening and looking up as if
they
had heard a sound

PHYLLIS
Its all right Go on Walter

NEFF
Look baby Theres a clause in every
accident policy a little something
called double indemnity The insurance
companies put it in as a sort of
come-on for the customers It means
they pay double on certain accidents
The kind that almost never happen
Like for instance if a guy got killed
on a train theyd pay a hundred
thousand instead of fifty

PHYLLIS
I see
(Her eyes widen with
excitement)

NEFF
Were hitting it for the limit baby
Thats why its got to be a train

PHYLLIS
Its going to be a train Walter
Just the way you say Straight down
the line

She was a nice kid and maybe he was
a little better than he sounded I
kind of hoped so for her sake but

head and her fathers application in
it Besides I had other problems to
work out There were plans to make
and Phyllis had to be in on them

quickly

B-16 NEFFS OFFICE - (DAY)

He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on
standing behind his desk opening some mail
papers out of his briefcase

book making a quick telephone call But nothing of

Then it was the fifteenth of June

You may remember that date Keyes I
do too only for a very different
reason You came into my office around
three in the afternoon

Keyes enters with some papers in his hand

NEFF
Hello Keyes

KEYES
I just came from Nortons office
The semi-annual sales records are
out Youre high man Walter Thats
twice in a row Congratulations

NEFF
Thanks How would you like a cheap
drink

KEYES

How would you like a fifty dollar
cut in salary

NEFF
How would I -- Do I laugh now or
wait until it gets funny

KEYES
Im serious Walter Ive been talking
to Norton Theres too much stuff
piling up on my desk Too much
pressure on my nerves I spend half
the night walking up and down in my
bed Ive got to have an assistant
I thought that you --

NEFF
Me Why pick on me

KEYES
Because Ive got a crazy idea you
might be good at the job

NEFF
Thats crazy all right Ima
salesman

KEYES

Yeah A peddler a glad-hander a
back-slapper Youre too good to be
a salesman

NEFF
Nobodys too good to be a salesman

KEYES
Phooey All you guys do is ring door-
bells and dish out a smooth line of
monkey talk Whats bothering you is
that fifty buck cut isnt it

NEFF
Thatd bother anybody

KEYES

Look Walter The job Im talking
about takes brains and integrity It
takes more guts than there is in
fifty salesman Its the hottest job
in the business

NEFF
Its still a desk job I dont want
a desk job

KEYES

A desk job Is that all you can see
in it Just a hard chair to park
your pants on from nine to five
Just a pile of papers to shuffle
around and five sharp pencils and a
scratch pad to make figures on with
maybe a little doodling on the side
Thats not the way I see it Walter
To me a claims man is a surgeon and
that desk is an operating table and
those pencils are scalpels and bone
chisels And those papers are not
just forms and statistics and claims
for compensation Theyre alive
theyre packed with drama with
twisted hopes and crooked dreams A
claims man Walter is a doctor and
a blood-hound and a cop and a judge
and a jury and a father confessor
all in one

The telephone rings on Neffs desk Automatically Keyes
grabs
the phone and answers
KEYES
Who Okay hold the line

He puts the phone down on the desk and continues to
Neff

KEYES

interested You dont want to work

Keyes turns

NEFF
Why dont you for instance

KEYES

Neff gets up from his desk

NEFF

call on

Keyes drives right ahead

KEYES
We even had the church all picked
out the dame and I She had a white
satin dress with flounces on it And
I was on my way to the jewelry store
to buy the ring Then suddenly that
little man in here started working
on me

He punches his stomach with his fist

NEFF
So you went back and started
investigating her That it

Keyes nods slowly a little sad and a little ashamed

He picks up some papers impatiently

KEYES
All right Im going What am I to
say to Norton How about that job I
want you for

NEFF
I dont think I want it Thanks
Keyes just the same

KEYES

Fair enough Just get this I picked

you for the job not because I think

youre so darn smart but because I

thought maybe you were a shade less

dumb than the rest of the outfit I

guess I was all wet Youre not

smarter Walter Youre just a little

taller
He goes out Neff is alone He watches the door close
turns and goes slowly to the water cooler He fills a
cup and stands holding it His thoughts are somewhere

After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water

the receptacle under the cooler He goes back to the

He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts
the desk He buttons the top button of his shirt and
his tie right He leaves the office with his briefcase
his arm

NEFFS VOICE

That was it Keyes and there was no
use kidding myself any more Those
fates I was talking about had only
been stalling me off Now they had
thrown the switch The gears had
meshed The machinery had started to
move and nothing could stop it The
time for thinking had all run out
From here on it was a question of
following the time table move by
move just as we had it rehearsed I
wanted my time all accounted for for
the rest of the afternoon and up to
the last possible moment in the
evening So I arranged to call ona
prospect in Pasadena about a public
liability bond When I left the office

that into his pants pocket

NEFFS VOICE

I stuffed a hand towel and a big
roll of adhesive tape into my pockets
so I could fake something that looked
like a cast on a broken leg Next
I fixed the telephone and the
doorbell so that the cards would
fall down if the bells rang That
way I would know there had been a
phone call or visitor while I was
away I left the apartment house by

Very interesting about the cigar
case

He walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard

NORTON
Anything else

KEYES
Not much Dietrichsons secretary
says she didnt know anything about
the policy There is a daughter but
all she remembers is Neff talking to
her father about accident insurance
at their house one night

NEFF
I couldnt sell him at first Mrs
Dietrichson opposed it He told me
hed think it over Later on I went
down to the oil fields and closed
him He signed the application and
gave me his check

NORTON
(Dripping with sarcasm)
A fine piece of salesmanship that
was Mr Neff

KEYES
Theres no sense in pushing Neff
around Hes got the best sales record
in the office Are your salesmen
supposed to know that the customer
is going to fall off a train
NORTON
Fall off a train Are we sure
Dietrichson fell off the train

There is a charged pause

KEYES
I dont get it

NORTON
You dont Mr Keyes Then what do
you think of this case This policy
might cost us a great deal of money
As you know it contains a double
indemnity clause Just what is your
opinion

KEYES
No opinion at all

NORTON
Not even a hunch One of those
interesting little hunches of yours

KEYES
Nope Not even a hunch

NORTON
Im surprised Mr Keyes Ive formed
a very definite opinion I think I
know -- in fact I know I know what
happened to Dietrichson

KEYES
You know you know what

NORTON
I know it was not an accident

He looks from Keyes to Neff and back to Keyes

NORTON
What do you say to that

KEYES
Me Youve got the ball Lets see
you run with it

NORTON
Theres a widespread feeling that
just because a man has a large office --
Neff

depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear

NORTON
(Into dictograph)
Yes Have her come in please

He replaces the earpiece He turns back to Keyes and

NORTON
-- that just because a man has a
large office he must be an idiot
Im having a visitor if you dont
mind

Keyes and Neff start to get up

NORTON
No no I want you to stay and watch
me handle this

The secretary has opened the door

Neff stands staring at the door He relaxes with an
effort of will Phyllis comes in She wears a gray
suit small black hat with a veil black gloves and
a black bag The secretary closes the door behind her
Norton goes to meet her
NORTON

Thank you very much for coming Mrs

Dietrichson I assure you I appreciate

it
He turns a little towards Keyes

NORTON
This is Mr Keyes

KEYES
How do you do

PHYLLIS
How do you do

NORTON
And Mr Neff

PHYLLIS
Ive met Mr Neff How do you do

Norton has placed a chair Phyllis sits Norton goes
behind
his desk

NORTON
Mrs Dietrichson I assure you of
our sympathy in your bereavement I
hesitated before asking you to come
here so soon after your loss

Phyllis nods silently

NORTON
But now that youre here I hope you
wont mind if I plunge straight into
business You know why we asked you
to come dont you

PHYLLIS
No All I know is that your secretary
made it sound very urgent

Keyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed
He

has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in
the

armholes of his vest He looks a little bored Neff
behind

him stands leaning against the false mantel
completely

dead-pan

NORTON
Your husband had an accident policy
with this company Evidently you
dont know that Mrs Dietrichson

PHYLLIS
No I remember some talk at the house --

She looks towards Neff

PHYLLIS
-- but he didnt seem to want it
NEFF
He took it out a few days later
Mrs Dietrichson

PHYLLIS
I see

NORTON
Youll probably find the policy among
his personal effects

PHYLLIS

His safe deposit box hasnt been
opened yet It seems a tax examiner
has to be present

NORTON

Please Mrs Dietrichson I dont
want you to think you are being
subjected to any questioning But
there are a few things we should
like to know

PHYLLIS
What sort of things

NORTON
We have the report of the coroners
inquest Accidental death We are
not entirely satisfied In fact we
are not satisfied at all
Phyllis looks at him coolly
Keyes looks vaguely interested
Neff is staring straight at Phyllis
NORTON
Frankly Mrs Dietrichson we suspect

suicide

Phyllis doesnt bat an eyelash

NORTON
Im sorry Would you like a glass of
water

PHYLLIS

Please
NORTON
Mr Neff

He indicates a thermos on a stand near Neff Neff pours

glass of water and carries it over to Phyllis She has
lifted
her veil a little She takes the glass from his hand

PHYLLIS
Thank you

Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second

NORTON
Had your husband been moody or
depressed lately Mrs Dietrichson
Did he seem to have financial worries
for instance

PHYLLIS
He was perfectly all right and I
dont know of any financial worries

NORTON
There must have been something Mrs
Dietrichson Let us examine this so-
called accident First your husband
takes out this policy in absolute
secrecy Why Because he doesnt
want his family to suspect what he
intends to do

PHYLLIS
Do what

NORTON
Commit suicide Next he goes on
this trip entirely alone He has to
be alone He hobbles all the way out
to the observation platform very
unlikely with his leg in a cast
unless he has a very strong reason
Once there he finds he is not alone
There is a man there What was his
name Keyes

Norton flips his fingers impatiently at Keyes who
doesnt

even bother to look up

KEYES
His name was Jackson Probably still
is

NORTON

Jackson So your husband gets rid of
this Jackson with some flimsy excuse
about cigars And then he is alone
And then he does it He jumps
Suicide In which case the company
is not liable

(Pause)
You know that of course We could
go to court --

PHYLLIS
I dont know anything In fact I
dont know why I came here

She makes as if to rise indignantly

NORTON
Just a moment please I said we
could go to court I didnt say we
want to Not only is it against our
practice but it would involve a
great deal of expense a lot of
lawyers a lot of time perhaps years

Phyllis rises coldly

NORTON
So what I want to suggest is a
compromise on both sides A settlement
for a certain sum a part of the
policy value --

PHYLLIS
Dont bother Mr Norton When I
came in here I had no idea you owed
me any money You told me you did
Then you told me you didnt Now you
tell me you want to pay me a part of
it whatever it is You want to
bargain with me at a time like this
I dont like your insinuations about
my husband Mr Norton and I dont
like your methods In fact I dont
like you Mr Norton Goodbye
gentlemen

She turns and walks out The door closes after her
There is
a pregnant pause Keyes straightens up in his chair

KEYES
Nice going Mr Norton You sure
carried that ball

Norton pours himself a glass of water and stands
holding it

KEYES
Only you fumbled on the goal line
Then you heaved an illegal forward
pass and got thrown for a forty-yard
loss Now you cant pick yourself up
because you havent got a leg to
stand on

NORTON
I havent eh Let her claim Let her
sue We can prove it was suicide

Keyes stands up

KEYES
Can we Mr Norton the first thing
that hit me was that suicide angle
Only I dropped it in the wastepaper
basket just three seconds later You
ought to take a look at the statistics
on suicide sometime You might learn
a little something about the insurance
business

NORTON
I was raised in the insurance
business Mr Keyes

KEYES
Yeah In the front office Come on
you never read an actuarial table in
your life Ive got ten volumes on
suicide alone Suicide by race by
color by occupation by sex by
seasons of the year by time of day
Suicide how committed by poisons
by fire-arms by drowning by leaps
Suicide by poison subdivided by
types of poison such as corrosive
irritant systemic gaseous narcotic
alkaloid protein and so forth
Suicide by leaps subdivided by leaps
from high places under wheels of

horn

trains under wheels of trucks under
the feet of horses from steamboats
But Mr Norton of all the cases on
record theres not one single case

of suicide by leap from the rear end
of a moving train And do you know
how fast that train was going at the
point where the body was found
Fifteen miles an hour Now how could
anybody jump off a slow moving train
like that with any kind of expectation
that he would kill himself No soap
Mr Norton Were sunk and were
going to pay through the nose and
you know it May I have this

Keyes throat is dry after the long speech He grabs
glass of water out of Nortons hand and drains it in
gulp

Norton is watching him almost stupefied Neff stands
the shadow of a smile on his face Keyes puts the glass
noisily on Nortons desk

KEYES
Come on Walter

Norton doesnt move or speak Keyes puts his hat on and
crosses towards the door Neff after him With the

in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance

Maybe he just didnt have time

KEYES
Oh maybe he just didnt know he was
insured

He has stopped in front of Neff They look at each
other for
a tense moment Neff hardly breathes

Keyes shakes his head suddenly

KEYES
No That couldnt be it You delivered
the policy to him personally didnt
you Walter And you got his check

NEFF
(Stiff-lipped but
his voice is as well
under control as he
can manage)

Sure I did
Keyes prods his stomach again

KEYES
Got any bicarbonate of soda

NEFF
No I havent

Keyes resumes his pacing

KEYES
Listen Walter Ive been living
with this little man for twenty-six
years Hes never failed me yet
Theres got to be something wrong

NEFF
Maybe Norton was right Maybe it was
suicide Keyes

KEYES
No Not suicide
(Pause)
But not accident either

NEFF
What else

There is another longer pause agonizing for Neff
Finally
Keyes continues

KEYES
Look A man takes out an accident
policy that is worth a hundred
thousand dollars if he is killed on
a train Then two weeks later he
is killed on a train And not ina
train accident mind you but falling
off some silly observation car Do
you know what the mathematical
probability of that is Walter One
out of I dont know how many billions
And add to that the broken leg It
just cant be the way it looks
Walter Something has been worked on
us

NEFF
Such as what
Keyes doesnt answer He goes on pacing up and down
Finally
Neff cant stand the silence any longer

NEFF
Murder

KEYES
(Prods stomach again)
Dont you have any peppermint or
anything

NEFF
Im sorry
(Pause)
Who do you suspect

KEYES
Maybe I like to make things easy for
myself But I always tend to suspect
the beneficiary

NEFF
The wife

KEYES
Yeah That wide-eyed dame that didnt
know anything about anything

NEFF
Youre crazy Keyes She wasnt even
on the train

KEYES
I know she wasnt Walter I dont
claim to know how it was worked or
who worked it but I know that it
was worked

He crosses to the corridor door
KEYES
Ive got to get to a drug store It
feels like a hunk of concrete inside
me
He puts his hand on the knob to open the door

C-11 CORRIDOR - APARTMENT HOUSE - NIGHT - LIGHTS ON

The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been
standing
close to the door of Neffs apartment listening The

door
has just started to open Phyllis moves away quickly
and
flattens herself against the wall behind the opening
door
Keyes is coming out
KEYES
Good night Walter
Neff behind him looks anxiously down the hallway for
Phyllis Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her
through
the crack of the partly opened door He pushes the door
wide
so as to hide her from Keyes
NEFF
Good night Keyes
KEYES
See you at the office in the morning
He has reached the elevator He pushes the call button
and

turns

KEYES
But Id like to move in on her right
now tonight if it wasnt for Norton
and his stripe-pants ideas about
company policy Id have the cops
after her so quick her head would
spin Theyd put her through the
wringer and brother what they
would squeeze out

NEFF
Only you havent got a single thing
to go on Keyes

The elevator has come up and stopped

NEFF
Wont you sit down

At the sound of the closing door she turns and speaks
catch in her voice

LOLA
Mr Neff I cant help it but I
have such a strange feeling that
there is something queer about my
fathers death

NEFF
Queer Queer in what way

LOLA
I dont know why I should be bothering
you with my troubles except that
you knew my father and knew about
the insurance he took out And you
were so nice to me that evening in
your car

NEFF
Sure We got along fine didnt we
He sits down His face is grim and watchful

LOLA
Look at me Mr Neff Im not crazy
Im not hysterical Im not even
crying But I have the awful feeling
that something is wrong and I had
the same feeling once before -- when
my mother died

NEFF
When your mother died

LOLA

We were up at Lake Arrowhead That
was six years ago We had a cabin
there It was winter and very cold
and my mother was very sick with
pneumonia She had a nurse with her
There were just the three of us in
the cabin One night I got up and
went into my mothers room She was
delirious with fever All the bed
covers were on the floor and the
windows were wide open The nurse
wasnt in the room I ran and covered
my mother up as quickly as I could
Just then I heard a door open behind
me The nurse stood there She didnt
say a word but there was a look in
her eyes Ill never forget Two days
later my mother was dead

(Pause)
Do you know who that nurse was

Neff stares at her tensely He knows only too well who
the
nurse was

NEFF
No Who

LOLA

Phyllis I tried to tell my father
but I was just a kid then and he
wouldnt listen to me Six months
later she married him and I kind of
talked myself out of the idea that
she could have done anything like
that But now its all back again
is

now that something has happened to
my father too

NEFF
Youre not making sense Miss
Dietrichson Your father fell off a
train

LOLA
Yes and two days before he fell off
that train what was Phyllis doing
She was in her room in front of a
mirror with a black hat on and she
was pinning a black veil to it as
if she couldnt wait to see how she
would look in mourning

NEFF
Look Youve had a pretty bad shock
Arent you just imagining all this

LOLA
I caught her eyes in the mirror and
they had that look in them they had
before my mother died That same
look

NEFF
You dont like your step-mother do
you Isnt it just because she is
your step-mother

LOLA
I loathe her Because she did it
She did it for the money Only youre
not going to pay her are you Mr
Neff Shes not going to get away
with it this time Im going to speak
up Im going to tell everything I

know

NEFF
Youd better be careful saying things
like that

LOLA

Im not afraid Youll see
She turns again to the window so he wont see that she

crying Neff gets up and goes to her
LOLA
Im sorry I didnt mean to act like
this

NEFF
All this that youve been telling me --
who else have you told

LOLA
No one

NEFF
How about your step-mother

LOLA
Of course not Im not living in the
house any more I moved out

of yours Zachetti

story
and now and then she laughs but there is no sound
CAMERA MOVES PAST HER TO A CLOSE SHOT OF NEFF behind
the
steering wheel He is only half listening to Lola His
mind
is full of other thoughts
NEFFS VOICE
Next day was Sunday and we went for
a ride down to the beach She had
loosened up a bit and she was even
laughing I had to make sure she
wouldnt tell that stuff about Phyllis
to anybody else It was dynamite
whether it was true or not And I
had no chance to talk to Phyllis
You were watching her like a hawk
Keyes I couldnt even phone her for
fear you had the wires tapped
D-6 INSURANCE OFFICE - 12TH FLOOR - DAY
Neff with his hat on and no briefcase is walking
toward
Keyes office As he comes up close to the door he
stops
with a startled expression on his face On a chair
beside
the door sits a familiar figure He is Jackson the man
from

the observation platform of the train He is wearing
his
Stetson hat and smoking a cigar He is studying
something in

the file folder Neff recognizes him immediately but

Jackson
does not look up Neff controls his expression and goes
on
to open the door to Keyes office
NEFFS VOICE
Monday morning there was a note on
my desk that you wanted to see me
Keyes For a minute I wondered if it
could be about Lola It was worse
Outside your door was the last guy
in the world I wanted to see
D-7 INT KEYES OFFICE
Neff is just closing the door from the inside Keyes
his
coat off is lying on his office couch chewing on a
cigar

as usual

KEYES
Come in Come in Walter I want to
ask you something After all the
years weve known each other do you
mind if I make a rather blunt
statement

NEFF
About what

KEYES
About me Walter Ima very great
man This Dietrichson business Its
murder and murders dont come any
neater As fancy a piece of homicide
as anybody ever ran into Smart and
tricky and almost perfect but --

Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball

KEYES
but I think Papa has it all figured
out figured out and wrapped up in
tissue paper with pink ribbons on
it

NEFF
Im listening
Keyes levels a finger at him

KEYES
You know what That guy Dietrichson
was never on the train

NEFF
He wasnt

KEYES
No he wasnt Walter Look you
cant be sure of killing a man by
throwing him off a train thats going
fifteen miles an hour The only way
you can be sure is to kill him first
and then throw his body on the tracks
That would mean either killing him
on the train or -- and this is where
it really gets fancy -- you kill him
somewhere else and put him on the
tracks Two possibilities and I
personally buy the second

NEFF
Youre way ahead of me Keyes

KEYES
Look it was like this They killed
the guy -- the wife and somebody
else -- and then the somebody else
took the crutches and went on the
train as Dietrichson and then the
somebody else jumped off and then
they put the body on the tracks where
the train had passed An
impersonation see And a cinch to
work Because it was night very few
people were about they had the
crutches to stare at and they never
really looked at the man at all

NEFF
Its fancy all right Keyes Maybe
its a little too fancy

KEYES
Is it I tell you it fits together
like a watch And now lets see what
we have in the way of proof The
only guy that really got a good look
at this supposed Dietrichson is
sitting right outside my office I

took the trouble to bring him down

here from Oregon Lets see what he
has to say

Keyes goes to the door and opens it

KEYES
Come in Mr Jackson

Jackson enters with the file folder

JACKSON
Yes sir Mr Keyes These are fine
cigars you smoke

He indicates the cigar he himself is smoking

KEYES
Two for a quarter

JACKSON
Thats what I said

KEYES
Never mind the cigar Jackson Did
you study those photographs What do
you say

JACKSON
Yes indeed I studied them
thoroughly Very thoroughly

KEYES
Well Did you make up your mind

JACKSON
Mr Keyes Im a Medford man Medford
Oregon Up in Medford we take our
time making up our minds --

KEYES
Well youre not in Medford now Im
in a hurry Lets have it

Jackson indicates the file folder he is holding
JACKSON
Are these photographs of the late

Mr Dietrichson

KEYES
Yes

JACKSON
Then my answer is no

KEYES
What do you mean no

JACKSON
I mean this is not the man that was
on the train

KEYES
Will you swear to that

JACKSON
Im a Medford man Medford Oregon
And if I say it I mean it and if I
mean it of course Ill swear it

KEYES
Thank you
Keyes turns to Neff
KEYES
There you are Walter Theres your

proof
Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson
KEYES

Oh Mr Jackson this is Mr Neff
one of our salesmen

JACKSON
Please to meet you Mr Neff Pleased
indeed

NEFF

How do you do

JACKSON
Very fine thank you Never was
better

KEYES

Mr Jackson how would you describe
the man you saw on that observation
platform

JACKSON
into it

low

he

Well Im pretty sure he was a younger
man about ten or fifteen years

younger than the man in these

photographs

KEYES
Dietrichson was about fifty
he Walter

NEFF

wasnt

Fifty-one according to the policy

JACKSON

The man I saw was nothing like fifty-
one years old Of course it was
pretty dark on that platform and
come to think of it he tried to

keep his back towards me But Im

positive just the same

KEYES

Thats fine Jackson Now you

understand this matter is strictly
confidential We may need you again
down here in Los Angeles if the

case comes to court

JACKSON

Any time you need me Im at your
entire disposal gentlemen Expenses

paid of course

Keyes picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks

KEYES

Get me Lubin in the cashiers office

Meanwhile Jackson crosses over to Neff and during the

ensuing dialogue between him and Neff

we hear Keyes

voice on the phone in background We do not hear what

says

JACKSON
(To Neff)

Ever been in Medford Mr Neff

NEFF
Never
JACKSON
Wait a minute Do you go trout
fishing Maybe I saw you up Klamath
Falls way

NEFF
Nope Never fish

JACKSON

KEYES

me better Theres a very good
osteopath down here I want to see

opened the door for Jackson
KEYES

Okay Mr Jackson Just dont put
her on the expense account

Jackson doesnt get it

JACKSON
Goodbye gentlemen A pleasure

He goes out

KEYES
There it is Walter Its beginning
to come apart at the seams already
A murders never perfect It always
comes apart sooner or later And
when two people are involved its
usually sooner We know the
Dietrichson dame is in it and
somebody else Pretty soon were
going to know who that somebody else
is Hell show Hes got to show
Sometime somewhere theyve got to
meet Their emotions are all kicked
up Whether its love or hate doesnt
matter They cant keep away from
each other They think its twice as
safe because there are two of them
But its not twice as safe Its ten
times twice as dangerous Theyve
committed a murder and thats not
like taking a trolley ride together
where each one can get off ata
different stop Theyre stuck with
each other Theyve got to ride all
the way to the end of the line And
its a one-way trip and the last
stop is the cemetery

He puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his

pockets
for matches
KEYES
(Continued)
She put in her claim and Im going
to throw it right back at her
(Pats his pockets
again)
Have you got one of those
Neff strikes a match for him Keyes takes the match out
of

his hand and lights his cigar

KEYES
Let her sue us if she dares Ill be
ready for her -- and that somebody
else Theyll be digging their own

where the cemetery was And I got to
thinking what cemeteries are for
Theyre to put dead people in I
guess that was the first time I ever
thought about Phyllis that way Dead
I mean and how things would be if
she was dead Because the way it was
now she had me by the throat She
could hang me higher than a kite any
day she felt like it And there was
nothing I could do except hold my
breath and watch that day come closer
and closer and maybe pray a little
if I still knew how to pray I saw

searches the papers on it He tries the desk drawers
and
finds them locked His eye falls on the dictaphone on
the
stand beside the desk A record is on it the needle is
about
two-thirds of the way towards the end He lifts the
needle
and sets it back to the beginning of the record sets
the
switch to playback position He lifts the arm off the
bracket
and starts the machine Keyes voice is heard coming
from
the horn
KEYES VOICE
(From Dictaphone)
Memo to Mr Norton Confidential
Dietrichson File With regard to
your proposal to put Walter Neff
under surveillance I disagree
absolutely I have investigated his
movements on the night of the crime
and he is definitely placed in his
apartment from 715 PM on In
addition to this I have known Neff
intimately for eleven years and I
personally vouch for him without
reservation
Neff stops the machine He sits down slowly still
holding

the horn He is deeply moved After a moment he
presses the
switch again
KEYES VOICE

(From Dictaphone)
Furthermore no connection
whatsoever has been established
between Walter Neff and Mrs Phyllis
Dietrichson whereas I am now able
to report that such a connection has
been established between her and
another man This man has been
observed to visit the Dietrichson
home on the night of July 9th 10th
1ith 12th and 13th We have succeeded
in identifying him as one Nino
Zachetti former medical student
aged twenty-eight residing at Lilac
Court Apartments 1228 N La Brea
Avenue We have checked Zachettis
movements on the night of the crime
and have found that they cannot be
accounted for I am preparing a more
detailed report for your consideration
and it is my belief that we already
have sufficient evidence against
Zachetti and Mrs Dietrichson to
justify police action I strongly
urge that this whole matter be turned
over to the office of the District
Attorney Respectfully Barton Keyes

Neff sits staring blankly at the wall The cylinder

goes on

revolving but no more voice comes -- only the whir of
the

needle on the empty record At last he remembers to
replace

the horn He hangs it back on its hook The machine
stops

Neff gets up from the chair walks slowly to the door
and

goes out

then stops rigidly as his face lights up with

a sudden idea He turns quickly and walks on to his own
and enters

D-18 NEFFS OFFICE (DAY)

Neff walks across to his desk lifts the telephone and
a number (During the ensuing telephone conversation
what he says is heard The pauses indicate speeches at
other end of the line)

NEFF

Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim
expression on his face takes a handkerchief out and

perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his
The gesture has a symbolic quality as if he were

wipe away the murder Over his face comes the

She wears white lounging pajamas and she is carrying
something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her

hand She reaches the front door opens it slightly
the catch so that the door can be opened from outside
switches off the porch light and the hall light She
towards the living room where there is still light on
NEFFS VOICE

She was all set and waiting for me

It could have been something in my

voice when I called her up that tipped

her off And it could have been that

she had the idea already And an

idea wasnt the only thing she had

waiting for me
D-20 LIVING ROOM
On the long table behind the davenport one of the
lit The only other light in the room is a standing

beside the desk A window toward the back is open and

it comes the SOUNDS OF MUSIC probably a neighboring

Phyllis enters and crosses to the table She puts out
lamp then moves over to the desk and puts out the lamp
The room is filled with bright moonlight coming in at
windows

Phyllis crosses to the chair by the fireplace (the one

sat in the first time Neff came to the house) She

loose cushion and puts what was in the scarf behind it

she withdraws the scarf there is a brief glint of

She turns to the low table in front of the davenport
takes a cigarette from the box She takes a match and
about to strike it when just then she hears a car

up the hill She listens motionless The car stops A
door is slammed

Calmly Phyllis strikes the match and lights her

She drops the match casually into a tray goes back to

chair sits down and waits quietly smoking There are
footsteps outside the house

Over the chair in which Phyllis is sitting the hallway
visible through the arch The front door opens Neff
in he is silhouetted against the moonlight as he
there He closes the door again
PHYLLIS
(In foreground)

In here Walter

Neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards

NEFF
Hello baby Anybody else in the
house

PHYLLIS

Nobody Why

NEFF
Whats that music

PHYLLIS
A radio up the street
Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport close to
her

NEFF
Just like the first time I was here
We were talking about automobile
insurance Only you were thinking
about murder And I was thinking
about that anklet

PHYLLIS
And what are you thinking about now

NEFF
Im all through thinking This is
goodbye

PHYLLIS

Goodbye Where are you going

NEFF
Its you thats going baby Not me
Im getting off the trolley car right
at this corner

PHYLLIS
Suppose you stop being fancy Lets
have it whatever it is

NEFF
I have a friend whos got a funny
theory He says when two people commit
a murder theyre kind of on a trolley
car and one cant get off without
the other Theyre stuck with each
other They have to go on riding
clear to the end of the line And
the last stop is the cemetery

PHYLLIS
Maybe hes got something there

NEFF
You bet he has Two people are going
to ride to the end of the line all
right Only Im not going to be one
of them Ive got another guy to
finish my ride for me

PHYLLIS
So youve got it all arranged Walter
NEFF
You arranged it for me I didnt
have to do a thing

PHYLLIS
Just who are you talking about

NEFF
An acquaintance of yours A Mr
Zachetti Come on baby I just got
into this because I knew a little
something about insurance didnt I
I was just a sucker Id have been
brushed-off as soon as you got your
hands on the money

PHYLLIS
What are you talking about

NEFF
Save it Im telling this Its been
you and that Zachetti guy all along
hasnt it

PHYLLIS
Thats not true

NEFF
It doesnt make any difference whether
its true or not The point is Keyes
believes Zachetti is the guy hes
been looking for Hell have him in
that gas chamber before he knows
what happened to him

PHYLLIS
And whats happening to me all this
time

NEFF
Dont be silly What do you expect
to happen to you You helped him do
the murder didnt you Thats what
Keyes thinks And whats good enough
for Keyes is good enough for me

PHYLLIS
Maybe its not good enough for me
Walter Maybe I dont go for the
idea Maybe Id rather talk

NEFF
Sometimes people are where they cant
talk Under six feet of dirt for
instance And if it was you theyd
just charge it up to Zachetti
wouldnt they One more item on his
account Sure they would Thats

just what theyre going to do
Especially since hes coming here
tonight Oh in about fifteen
minutes from now baby With the

cops right behind him Its all taken
care of

PHYLLIS
And thatd make everything lovely
for you wouldnt it

NEFF
Right And its got to be done before
that suit of yours comes to trial
and Lola gets a chance to sound off
and they trip you up on the stand
and you start to fold up and drag me
down with you

PHYLLIS
Listen Walter Maybe I had Zachetti
here so they wont get a chance to
trip me up So we can get that money
and be together

NEFF
Thats cute Say it again

PHYLLIS
He came here the first time just to
ask where Lola was I made him come
back I was working on him Hes
crazy sort of guy quick-tempered I
kept hammering into him that she was
with another man so hed get into
one of his jealous rages and then
Id tell him where she was And you
know what hed have done to her
dont you Walter

NEFF
Yeah and for once I believe you
Because its just rotten enough

PHYLLIS
Were both rotten Walter
NEFF
Only youre just a little more rotten
Youre rotten clear through You got
me to take care of your husband and
then you got Zachetti to take care
of Lola and maybe take care of me
too and then somebody else would
have come along to take care of
Zachetti for you Thats the way you
operate isnt it baby

PHYLLIS
Suppose it is Walter Is what youve
cooked up for tonight any better

Neff gets up from the davenport He listens to the
music for
a moment

NEFF
I dont like this music anymore
Its too close Do you mind if I
shut the window

Phyllis just stares at him He goes quietly over to the

window
and shuts it and draws the curtain Phyllis speaks to
his
back
PHYLLIS
(Her voice low and
urgent)
Walter
Neff turns something changes in his face There is the
report
of a gun He stands motionless for a moment then very
slowly

starts towards her CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER HIS
SHOULDER at

Phyllis as she stands with the gun in her hand Neff
stops

after he has taken a few steps

NEFF
Whats the matter Why dont you
shoot again Maybe if I came a little
closer
again

Quietly he

and
there

moment

quivers

limp

Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops

NEFF
Hows that Do you think you can do
it now

Phyllis is silent She doesnt shoot Her expression is
tortured Neff goes on until he is close to her

takes the gun out of her unresisting hand

NEFF
Why didnt you shoot baby

Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender

NEFF
Dont tell me its because youve
been in love with me all this time

PHYLLIS

No I never loved you Walter Not

you or anybody else Im rotten to
the heart I used you just as you

said Thats all you ever meant to

me -- until a minute ago I didnt

think anything like that could ever
happen to me

NEFF
Im sorry baby Im not buying

PHYLLIS
Im not asking you to buy Just hold
me close
Neff draws her close to him She reaches up to his face
kisses him on the lips As she comes out of the kiss
is realization in her eyes that this is the final
NEFF
Goodbye baby

Out of the shot the gun explodes once twice Phyllis

in his arms Her eyes fill with tears Her head falls
against his shoulder Slowly he lifts her and carries

her to

the davenport He lays her down on it carefully almost

tenderly The moonlight coming in at the French doors
shines

on the anklet He looks at it for the last time and
slowly

turns away As he does so he puts his hand inside his
coat

and it comes out with blood on it Only then is it
apparent

that Phyllis shot actually did hit him He looks at
the

blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and
quickly

goes out of the room the way he came

D-21 EXT DIETRICHSON HOME - (NIGHT)

Neff comes out of the house He closes the front door
with

his right hand His left arm hangs limp He takes a few
steps

down the walk then suddenly hears somebody
approaching He
moves behind the palm tree near the walk

A man comes up the steps towards the front door --

Zachetti
Just as he reaches the door Neff calls to him
NEFF
Hey you Come here a minute I said
come here Zachetti
Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly
NEFF
The name is Neff
ZACHETTI
Yeah And I still dont like it
What do you want
NEFF
Look kid I want to give you a
present
He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds
out a

coin
NEFF
Heres a nice new nickel

ZACHETTI
Whats the gag

NEFF
Suppose you go back down the hill to
a drug store and make a phone call

Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachettis
handkerchief
pocket Zachetti knocks his hand away

ZACHETTI
Keep your nickel and buy yourself an
ice cream cone

NEFF
The number is Granite 0386 Ask for
Miss Dietrichson The first name is
Lola

ZACHETTI
Lola She isnt worth a nickel And
if I ever talk to her its not going
to be over any telephone

NEFF
Tough arent you Take the nickel
Take it and call her She wants you
to

ZACHETTI
Yeah She doesnt want any part of
me

NEFF
I know who told you that and its
not true Shes in love with you
Always has been Dont ask me why I
couldnt even guess

Zachetti just stares at him Neff moves again to put
the

nickel into Zachettis pocket This time Zachetti
allows him

to do it

NEFF

He motions toward the street below

NEFF
That way

Zachetti goes slowly past him Neff grabs him and
almost violently down the walk Zachetti goes out of
The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after
Then far off in the distance the SIREN OF A POLICE
heard

Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of

house where he parked his car

D-22 NEFFS OFFICE - (NIGHT)

The desk lamp is still lighted Outside the windows
dawn is slowly breaking

Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone
are eight or nine used cylinders on the desk beside
widening stain of blood shows on the left shoulder of
gray jacket He is very weak by now and his voice
note of utter exhaustion

NEFF
Its almost four-thirty now Keyes
Its cold I wonder if shes still
lying there alone in that house or
whether theyve found her by now I
wonder a lot of things but they
dont matter any more except I want
to ask you to do me a favor I want
you to be the one to tell Lola kind
of gently before it breaks wide
open Yes and Id like you to
look after her and that guy Zachetti
so he doesnt get pushed around too
much Because

Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive
feeling
that he is not alone in the room

As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly
The

office door is wide open Keyes is standing a few steps
inside

it Behind him on the balcony outside stands the
night

watchman and the colored janitor peering curiously
into the

room over Keyes shoulder

Slowly and without taking his eyes off Neffs face
Keyes
reaches back and pushes the door shut

Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn He looks at Keyes
witha
faint tired grin and speaks very slowly

NEFF
Hello Keyes

Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without
answering

NEFF
Up pretty early arent you I always
wondered what time you got down to
work

Keyes staring at him still does not answer

NEFF
Or did your little man pull you out
of bed

KEYES
The janitor did Seems you leaked a
little blood on the way in here

NEFF
Wouldnt be surprised

Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders
standing
on the desk
NEFF
I wanted to straighten out that
Dietrichson story for you

KEYES
So I gather

NEFF
How long have you been standing there

KEYES
Long enough

NEFF
Kind of a crazy story with a crazy
twist to it One you didnt quite
figure out

KEYES
You cant figure them all Walter

NEFF
Thats right You cant can you
And now I suppose I get the big
speech the one with all the two-
dollar words in it Lets have it
Keyes

KEYES
Youre all washed up Walter

NEFF
Thanks Keyes That was short anyway

They stare at each other for a long moment then with
intense

effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there
swaying a

little His face is covered with sweat His shoulder is

bleeding He is on the verge of collapse

KEYES
Walter Im going to call a doctor

NEFF
(Bitterly)
What for So they can patch me up
So they can nurse me along till Im
back on my feet So I can walk under
my own power into that gas chamber
up in San Quentin Is that it Keyes
KEYES
Something like that Walter

NEFF
Well Ive got a different idea
Look here Suppose you went back to
bed and didnt find these cylinders
till tomorrow morning when the office
opens From then on you can play it
any way you like Would you do that
much for me Keyes

KEYES
Give me one good reason

NEFF
I need four hours to get where Im
going

KEYES

Youre not going anywhere Walter

NEFF
You bet I am Im going across the
border

KEYES

You havent got a chance

NEFF
Good enough to try for

KEYES
Youll never make the border

NEFF
Thats what you think Watch me

Neff starts to move towards the door staggering a

little
holding himself upright with great effort
KEYES
(In a voice of stony
calm)
Youll never even make the elevator
Neff has reached the door He twists the knob and drags
the
door open He turns in it to look back at Keyes
implacable

face
NEFF
So long Keyes

Neff goes out leaving the door wide open THE CAMERA

FOLLOWS
his staggering walk along the BALCONY TOWARDS THE
ELEVATOR
LOBBY The sound of his breathing is so harsh and loud
that
for a moment it dominates the scene Finally he reaches
the
swing doors leading into the lobby and starts to push
them
open At this moment he collapses He clutches the edge
of
the door and as it swings around with him he falls to
the
floor He tries to struggle up but cannot rise
In background comes the sound of a telephone being
dialed
KEYES VOICE
Hello Send an ambulance to the
Pacific Building on Olive Street
Yeah Its a police job
There is the sound of the phone being replaced in its
cradle
Then there are footsteps growing louder along the
balcony
and Keyes walks slowly into the shot He kneels down
beside

Neff

KEYES
How you doing Walter

Neff manages a faint smile

NEFF
Im fine Only somebody moved the
elevator a couple of miles away

KEYES
Theyre on the way

difficulty)

Neff fumbles for the handkerchief in Keyes pocket
out and clumsily wipes his face with it The
drops from his hand He gets a loose cigarette out of

pocket and puts it between his lips Then with great
difficulty he gets out a match tries to strike it but

too weak Keyes takes the match out of his hand
for him and lights his cigarette
