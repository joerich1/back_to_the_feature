of Light searching the sky from big search-
Lights placed around the theater We see a

street sign saying Hollywood Boulevard

wnich is alternately lit up and dark as the
Dean hits it We see the front of the Deyptian
Theater and enormous crowds along the boulevard
and fron the clothes of the people we see that
we are in the late 20ts

The marquee reads Fremiere Tonight
Biggest Picture of 19274

A couple of kids have climbed a paln tree and

The police are holding pack surging crotds
which are pressing against ropes forming an
aisle from the street to the entrance to the

stars and the heading Loclevcod and Lanont -
