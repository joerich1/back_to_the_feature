FADE IN

A ROCK SURFACE A SHORT TIME LATER

A chameleon blends in with its terrain Its eyes shift It
walks away PAN DOWN the rock to reveal a shadow then a
dark crevice

DARKNESS

Two little eyes dart erratically across FRAME As bg
becomes lighter we realize that the eyes belong to a FIELD
MOUSE

EXT SHADE TREE AREA - CONTINUOUS

As the field mouse scampers a huge lion paw THUDS into

frame and traps the mouse in its jaillike claws PULL BACK
TO REVEAL

SCAR a thin angular lion with an attitude problem He

gingerly lifts the mouse by its tail and dangles it over his
gaping mouth Rather than eat the mouse Scar rolis it
through his paw the way a gambier -rolis a coin

SCAR

Life‘s not fair ‘es -- You see I

- shall never be king And you shall
never see another day Adieu

a
As Scar is about to eat the mouse he HEARS

ZAZU §(0S)
Didn‘’t your mother ever tell you not
to play with your food

SCAR
Oh Zazu «What do-you want

REVEAL Zazu the hornbill we met in the opening scene Zazu
blends regal with ironic edge He reveres his boss (King
Mufasa) and disdains anyone he perceives to be a low-life
cretin - which is pretty much everybody byt the King
ZAZU
I’m here to announce that King
Mufasa’s on his way And youd
better have a good excuse for
missing the ceremony this morning

fhe little mouse escapes to freedon

SCAR
(mock sad)
Now look Zazu You’ve made me lose
my lunch

ZAZU
You‘ll lose more than that when the
king gets through with you He’s as
mad as a hippo with a hernia

Scar licking his chops advances on Zazu - who backs away

SCAR
Ocooo I quiver with fear

ZAZU
Now Scar -- Don’t look at nme that

ways fb oes

Scar continues stalking

ZAZU (CONT’D) —
Help Joi
Scar catches Zazu in his mouth And CHOMPS his teeth shut
Mufasa enters having witnessed what Scar just did

Scar

Scar surprised and with a bird bulge in his mouth

SCAR
Hmm

With that Zazu’s beak ‘pokesout from Scar’s lips It looks
like the mouth-within-a-mouth in “Alien

ZAZU‘S BEAK
Impeccabie timing Your Majesty

MUFASA
(to a disobedient
puppy)
Drop hin

SCAR
releasing Zazu)
Plegh

Zazu tumbles toe the ground and shakes off

SCAR
(to Mufasa)
Why if it isn’t my big brother
descending from on high to mingle
among the commoners

MUFASA
Sarabi and I didn’t see you at the
i a presentation of Simba
(genuine)
Is anything wrong

SCAR
(insincere)
That was today Oh I feel simply
awful Must have slipped my mind

ZAZU
Yes well as slippery as your mind
is -- as the king’s brother you
should have been first in line

Scar nips at Zazu -- who evades hin

SCAR
I was first in line until the little
hairball was born

MUFASA
That hairball is my son and your
future king ¢

SCAR cf
I shall practice my’ “ourtsy

Scar abruptly turns to walk away Mufasa calls after hin

MUFASA
Don’t turn your back on me Scar

Scar reels back around
SCAR
Oh no Mufasa Perhaps you
shouldn’t turn your back on me

MUFASA
Is that a challenge

Zazu ducks behind a rock

SCAR
(pointed)
Temper-temper
(butter wouldnt
melt)
A challenge Oh I wouldnt dream
of it

Zazu hops forward

ZazU
Pity
(a beat)
Why not
SCAR

Well as far as brains go I got the
lion’s share But when it comes to
brute strength I’m afraid I’a in
the shallow end of the gene pool

Scar slinks away JZazu and Mufasa watch him leave

a ZAZU

eo There’s one in every family Sire

Sat Two in mine actually And they
always manage to ruin special
occasions

As they walk off

MUFASA
What am I going to do with hin

ZAZU
Hed make a very handsome throw rug
(good idea)
Zazu

ZAZU
And just think Whenever he gets
cirty you can take hin out and beat
hin

in Zazu’s eye Zazu grabs for gomething to blow his nose
in unaware he’s tugged an elephant’s ear

NO

ZAZ we)
THUS FAR A RATHER UNINS ING THING
The elephant uses his trunk like a golf club and knocks Zazu
out of frame He bounces across a stream -- like a skipping
stone A reflection of flamingoes shatters and the birds
burst into flight

Simba and Nala race in

“SIMBA
OH I JUST CANT WAIT TO BE KING

Zazu wades through holding up his feathers like and old
aunt holding up her skirt at the beach
ZAZU
(talking)
You’ve rather a long way to go
young master if you think I’m going
to stand by while you run around
like a snot-nosed

Simba and Nala trade off making faces behind Zazu’s back --

when Zazu turns to look at one the other is making the rude
face He finally catches them in the act They run circles
around the old bird and leave hin behind in a puddle

SIMBA (singing) ZAZU (speaking)
NO-ONE SAYING DO THIS - When I said that I -
NO-ONE SAYING BE THERE- What I meant was that the -
NO-ONE SAYING STOP THAT - What you don‘t realise is
that sometimes -
NO-ONE SAYING SEE HERE - Now see here
FREE TO RUN AROUND ALL DAY - That’s definitely out -

FREE TO DO IT ALL MY WAY

Simba and Nala are saluted by two lines of Zebras Zazu
comes flapping after them and the Zebras and trap hin

Simba and Nala zip in and out of animals’ legs Zazu tries
to catch them Their heads pop in and out from behind legs

Simba stands on a giraffe’s head He orders the animals
They obey Zazu gets caught underfoot

EVERYBODY LOOK LEFT - Aaaaaaaeek

Giraffes stand in a semi-circle Simba steps from head to

Now it’s a cacophony of animal movement ali building
African Bushy Berkley style - until Zazu gets caught
between two animals’ rear ends
