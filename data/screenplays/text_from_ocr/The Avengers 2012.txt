Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation
section

of the facility Hundreds of technicians and other staff run

around taking only the essentials

AGENT PHIL COULSON
Dr Selvig read an energy surge from
the Tesseract four hours ago

NICK FURY
NASA didnt authorize Selvig to test

AGENT PHIL COULSON
He wasnt testing it he wasnt even in

CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

AGENT MARIA HILL
Sir evacuation may be futile

NICK FURY
We should tell them to go back to

AGENT MARIA HILL
If we cant control the Tesseracts
energy there may not be a minimum safe
distance

NICK FURY
I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
prototypes are shipped out

AGENT MARIA HILL

INT NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY VACUUM CHAMBER
CONTINUOUS

Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being

held
by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER
NICK FURY
Talk to me doctor
DR ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine
concerned

The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
shoot out at random

SELVIG
Director

NICK FURY
s there anything we know for certain

SELVIG
Tesseract is misbehaving

fq

NICK FURY
s that supposed to be funny

SELVIG

No its not funny at all The
Tesseract is not only active
shesmisbehaving

NICK FURY
How soon until you pull the plug
SELVIG
Shes an energy source If we turn off
the power she turns it back on If she
reaches peak level

NICK FURY
Weve prepared for this doctor
Harnessing energy from space

SELVIG
We dont have the harness Our
calculations are far from complete Now
shes throwing off interference
radiation Nothing harmful low levels
of gamma radiation

NICK FURY
That can be harmful Wheres Barton

SELVIG
The Hawk Up in his nest as usual
We see CLINT BARTON dressed in black tactical gear is up

the railings watching them below Fury calls Barton on his
earpiece

NICK FURY
Agent Barton report
BARTON rappels down from the catwalk Walks up to Fury They
both walk around the facility in a discreet manner

NICK FURY
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things

CLINT BARTON
Well I see better from a distance

NICK FURY
Are you seeing anything that might set
this thing off

NASA SCIENTIST

(TO SELVIG)

NICK FURY
At this end

CLINT BARTON
Yeah the cube is a doorway to the
other end of space right The doors
open from both sides
DR SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
monitoring his worst nightmares Suddenly- the Tesseract
THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility Big enough where

Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and theyre at different

of the facility
The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter

louder like a boiling pot of water The Tesseracts energy
builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge which

at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device
great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy The beam
forms a VORTEX which then opens up a PORTAL
A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED From the portal the blackness of

SPACE beautiful and mysterious strewn with a billion stars

appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room

everyone
The Tesseracts energy forms into a cloud that reaches to

top the facilitys vacuum chamber ceiling Its abnormally
quiet Then HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform
SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach weapons in hands A figure is
kneeling on the platform smoke coming off it Its LOKI
Smiling in his mischievous manner he raises his head The

dies down He looks deep into the eyes of Fury Barton and
Selvig He stands up holing the scepter

NICK FURY
Sir please put down the spear
Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where

and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING

TOWARDS THEM BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
Lokis fired shot

ALL HELL BREAKS Machine gun fire is shot at Loki but the
bullets bounce off him like a boss Loki jumps high from the
platform and ATTACKS those firing at him

his

waits to

almost

Barton

mind

In the blink of an eye Loki takes down several guards with
KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter He stops and
see who will attack him next Honestly the whole lab has

gone to shit
Barton tries to stand up Loki quickly walks towards him

raises his gun but Loki grabs Bartons hand

LOKI
You have heart
Loki points the head of his spear at Bartons head Bartons
eyes suddenly glow BLACK The ability to control Bartons

is now in Lokis hand Barton puts his piece away and stands
straight

As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
several SHIELD personnel Fury takes the Tesseract
placing it back into its case and tries to leave the

labThen

LOKI
Please dont I still need that

NICK FURY

(TURNING)
This doesnt have to get any messier

LOKI
Of course it does Ive come too far
for anything else I am Loki of Asgard
and I am burdened with glorious
purpose

SELVIG
Loki Brother of Thor

NICK FURY
We have no quarrel with your people

LOKI
An ant has no quarrel with a boot

NICK FURY
You planning to step on us

LOKI
I come with glad tidings of a world
made free

FURY

in

NICK FURY
Free from what

LOKI
Freedom Freedom is lifes great lie
Once you accept that in your heart
Like a gunslinger Loki turns to face Selvig whos
standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvigs

Selvigs eyes glow BLACK

LOKI
You will know peace

NICK FURY
Yeah you say peace I kind of think
you mean the other thing
From the vacuum chamber ceiling Tesseracts energy cloud
RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion

CLINT BARTON
Sir Director Fury is stalling This
place is about to blow Drop a hundred
feet of rock on us He means to bury
us

NICK FURY
Like The Pharaohs of Odin

SELVIG
Hes right The portal is collapsing in
on itself You got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical

LOKI

Well then
Loki looking at Barton who doesnt even hesitate SHOOTS

WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND Barton grabs the case containing

Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki Selvig and the other
SHIELD personnel Loki is controlling

NICK FURY (CONTD)

You talk about peace and you kill

whats his play

THOR

(COMING TOO)
He has an army called the Chitauri

They all
Theyre not of Asgard or any world
known He means to lead them against
your people They will win him the
earth In return I suspect for the
Tesseract

STEVE

(SERIOUSLY)
An army From outer space

BANNER
So hes building another portal Thats
what he needs Erik Selvig for

THOR
Selvig

BANNER
Hes an astrophysicist

THOR
Hes a friend

NATASHA
Loki has him under some kind of spell
along with one of ours

STEVE
wanna know why Loki let us take him
Hes not leading an army from here

BANNER
dont think we should be focusing on
Loki That guys brain is a bag full of
cats you could smell crazy on him

THOR

Have care how you speak Loki is beyond
reason but he is of Asgard and hes
my brother

NATASHA
He killed eighty people in two days

THOR
Hes adopted

BANNER
Iridium what did they need the Iridium
for
TONY
Its a stabilizing agent
(walks in with Coulson to

COULSON)
Ill fly you there Keep the love
alive Means the portal wont collapse
on itself like it did at SHIELD

TONY (CONTD)

(TO THOR)
No hard feelings Point Break Youve
got a mean swing
(referring to the Iridium)
Also it means the portal can open as
wide and stay open as long as Loki
wants

(TO CREW)
Uh raise the mid-mast ship the top
sails That man is playing GALAGA
Thought we wouldnt notice But we did
(covering his eye looks

AROUND)
How does Fury do this

AGENT MARIA HILL

He turns

Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE
HACKING

IMPLANT under Furys desk without anyone noticing

TONY
Well that sounds exhausting The rest
of the raw materials Agent Barton can
get his hands on pretty easily Only
major component he still needs is a
power source A high energy density
something to kick start the cube

AGENT MARIA HILL
When did you become an expert in
thermonuclear astrophysics

TONY
Last night The packet Selvigs notes
the Extraction Theory papers Am I the
only one who did the reading

STEVE
as

Does Loki need any particular kind of
power source

BANNER
Hes got to heat the cube to a
hundredand twenty million Kelvin just
to break through the Coulomb barrier

TONY
Unless Selvig has figured out how to
stabilize the quantum tunneling effect

BANNER
Well if he could do that he could
achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
on the planet

TONY
Finally someone who speaks English

STEVE
Is that what just happened
Tony and Banner shake hands A glimmer in their eyes shines

the mutual respect for each other shows

TONY
Its good to meet you Dr Banner
Youre work on anti-electron collisions
is unparalleled And Im a huge fan of
the way you lose control and turn into
an enormous green rage monster

BANNER

(LOOKS DOWN)
Thanks

NICK FURY

(WALKING IN)
Dr Banner is only here to track the
cube I was hoping you might join him

STEVE

Lets start with that stick of his It
may be magical but it works an awful
lot like a HYDRA weapon

NICK FURY
dont know about that but it is
powered by the cube And Id like to

to

on

know how Loki used it to turn two of
the sharpest men I know into his
personal flying monkeys

THOR
Monkeys I do not understand

STEVE
I do I understood that reference

process

TONY
Nothing

STEVE

(TO BANNER)
Hey Are you nuts

TONY
You really have got a lid on it
havent you Whats your secret Mellow
jazz Bongo drums Huge bag of weed

STEVE
Is everything a joke to you

TONY
Funny things are

STEVE
Threatening the safety of everyone on
this ship isnt funny No offense
doctor

BANNER
No its alright I wouldnt have come
aboard if I couldnt handle pointy

things

TONY
Youre tiptoeing big man You need to
strut

STEVE

And you need to focus on the problem
Mr Stark
TONY
You think Im not Why did Fury call us
and why now Why not before What isnt
he telling us I cant do the equation
unless I have all the variables

STEVE
You think Furys hiding something

TONY
Hes a spy Captain hes the spy His
secrets have secrets
(points to Banner)
Its bugging him too isnt it

BANNER
(bobbling the words)
UhI just wanna finish my work here
and

STEVE
Doctor
A beat

BANNER
A warm light for all mankind Lokis
jab at Fury about the cube

STEVE
I heard it

BANNER
(pointing at Tony)
Well I think that was meant for you
Even if Barton didnt post that all
over the news

STEVE
The Stark Tower That big ugly
(Tony gives him a look)
-building in New York

BANNER
Its powered by Stark Reactors self-
sustaining energy source That building
will run itself for what a year

TONY
Thats just the prototype Im kind of
the only name in clean energy right
now
BANNER
(referring to Tony)
So why didnt SHIELD bring him in on
the Tesseract project I mean what are
they doing in the energy business in
the first place

TONY
I should probably look into that once
my decryption programmer finishes
breaking into all of SHIELDs secure
files

STEVE
(taken by that)
Im sorry did you say

TONY
Jarvis has been running it since I hit
the bridge In a few hours well know
every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
tried to hide
(holds out a bag of blueberries)
Blueberry

STEVE
Yet youre confused about why they
didnt want you around

TONY
An intelligence organization that fears
intelligence Historically not
possible

STEVE
I think Lokis trying to wind us up
This is a man who means to start a war
and if dont stay focused hell
succeed We have orders we should
follow them

TONY
Following is not really my style

STEVE

(SMILING)
And youre all about style arent you

TONY
(a nerve hit)
Of the people in this room which one
is A wearing a spangly outfit and B
not of use

BANNER
Steve tell me none of this smells a
little funky to you
Steve takes in the possibility but as an obedient soldier
shakes it off

STEVE
Just find the cube
Steve walks out of the lab Still torn apart by the
possibility
he walks away towards the HULL of the ship

BACK IN THE LAB

TONY
Thats the guy my dad never shut up
about Wondering if they shouldnt have
kept him on ice

BANNER

The guys not wrong about Loki He does
have the jump on us

TONY
What hes got is an ACME dynamite kit

TONY (CONTD)
Its gonna blow up in his face and Im
gonna be there when it does

BANNER
And Ill read all about it

TONY
Uh-huh Or youll be suiting up like
the rest of us

BANNER
Ah see I dont get a suit of armor
Im exposed like a nerve Its a
nightmare

TONY
You know Ive got a cluster of
shrapnel trying every second to crawl
its way into my heart
(points at the MINI-ARC
REACTOR in his chest)
This stops it This little circle of
light Its part of me now not just
armor Its a terrible privilege

BANNER
But you can control it

TONY
Because I learned how

BANNER
Its different
Banner tries to read the computer screen but Tony slides
the
data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face

TONY
Hey Ive read all about your accident
That much gamma exposure should have
killed you

BANNER
So youre saying that the Hulk the
other guy saved my life

BANNER (CONTD)
Thats nice Its a nice sentiment
Saved it for what

A lot of guys think that until the
pain stops
