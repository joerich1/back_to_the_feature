struggling figures pile in front of her desk Two huge
GUARDS are dragging a fighting frenzied MAN to his final
destination The man is tied up in a straight-jacket and
has his face covered in a bizarre combination of mask and
muzzle Spit flies from the masks airhole as the man
SCREAMS

Guard 1 SLAMS some papers down on the nurses desk

The man suddenly goes berserk and sends a hard kick to
Guard 1s groin The man starts to run off

Guard 2 clotheslines the man and bounces his head off the
desk Guard 1 recovers and slides the papers back towards
the nurse The nurse takes a long look at the man whos
etill stunned

NURSE

Take him to number nine
She leans over her desk and watches as the guards drag the
man off down a long corridor

ON THE CORRIDOR

Each side is lined with cell doors Each door features a
small barred window The guards drag the man to the last
cell at the end of the corridor The man starts to cone
around as Guard 1 produces a huge RATTLING keychain and
unlocks the cell door

ON THE CENTER WINDOW

as the mans face comes SMASHING UP against the bars We

blue eyes

The entire cell is covered in crudely sketched crosses
There are crosses on the walls the floor the ceiling
everywhere The bed the chair even the bed frame Hunched
in one corner putting the last cross in the last bit of
space with the last piece of whittled crayon is John
Trent Hes free from the straight-jacket

handkerchief down on the crayon covered chair and sits
down

crosses all over him as well head to toe

FLASHBACK
INT ATLANTIC INSURANCE OFFICE DAY
CLOSE ON A NERVOUS OVERWEIGHT MIDDLE-AGED MAN

His fingers tremble as he tries to light a cigarette We
can tell his breath stinks just by looking at him sweat
drips down at least two chins before finally coming to rest
on his tie which passed loud two decades ago

A pair of rock-steady hands REACH IN and light the
cigarette for hin

TRENT (0S)
Nervous Mr Paul

We REVEAL John Trent leaning against the desk that Mr
Paul is sitting in front of Another man ROBINSON sits
behind it Trent is Clean attractive sonfident Light
years away from the man we know from cell number nine Hes
doing what he likes doing best catching people in a lie

MR PAUL

(heavy Queens

accent)
What the fuck I got to be
nervous about You told me
“come down and sign some
papers I come down to sign
the papers I sign the papers
I get the check

(scared)
Right
Trent just stares at Mr Paul who begins to grow more and
more uncomfortable After what seems like an eternity
Trent responds

TRENT
Usually yes thats the way y
it goes Its just that I have
a few final questions to ask
you about the fire

cay

MR PAUL
More questions I answered
all your goddamn questions

TRENT

Of course you have and youve
been damn cooperative
Atlantic Insurance appreciates
it My friend Robby here
appreciates it

(to Robinson)
Dont you Robby

ROBINSON
(sarcastic) -
Immensely

TRENT
(back to Mr
Paul)
All we need you to do is clear
up a little argument Robby and
I seem to be having You see
Robby here claims that you
burned down your warehouse on
Northern Boulevard °
MR PAUL
(enraged)
What Thats horseshit My
whole stock was in that
warehouse My whole life

Calm down Mr Paul because

thats just what I told ny

friend Robby when he made such

an outrageous accusation

Mr Paul calms down
TRENT (CONT )

Thing is though Robby and 1
have been friends for a really
long time So I couldnt let
something like this come
between us Could I

(beat) I
Could I

MR PAUL
(unsure)
No

TRENT
Im glad you understand I
thought you would thats why
I knew you wouldnt mind if I
checked your story out with
your wife

MR PAUL
(sees it coming)
My wife

TRENT
Yes you see we had these
nagging pictures of your wife
tooling around town wearing
articles which you claimed
perished in the fire

Trent throws a package of photos into Mr Pauls lap

TRENT (CONT)
And you know what else When I
went to speak with her she
was more than eager to tell us
what really went down
Especially after I showed her
the pictures of Miss Rosa who
seems to be wearing even pore
of the articles which you
claimed perished in the fire

MR PAUL
(dazed)
Miss Rosa

Trent throws another pile of photos into Mr Pauls lap
then leans in quite close

TRENT
Two words of advice my friend
If youre going to pull a
scan dont make your wife
your partner And if you do
Gont fuck around behind her
back

Trent sniles

INT MIDTOWN COFFEE SHOP - pay
CLOSE ON A PLATE GLASS WINDOW

overlooking the busy street outside Inside we HEAR the
BUZZ of the heavy lunch crowd

ROBINSON That was beautiful Johnny-boy
you have the best nose for
shit in the business

Out on the street we see a city bus HISS to a stop in
front of the coffee shop window We can see its side
advertisement a COMING SOON ad for IN THE MOUTH OF
MADNESS bearing both Sutter Cane’s name and the name of
his publisher “ARCANE PUBLISHING After a beat or two
the bus PULLS oUT
TRENT (0S)

You were lucky this time the

guys wife liked ny eyes

We PULL BACK to REVEAL Trent and Robinson sharing a booth
and some coffee -

TRENT (CCNT)
You should train your agents
not to sell policies to
kindergarten con-men

ROBINSON
Agents You mean
These greedy pricks would sell
auto insurance to blind
drivers if they thought it
could get them a commission

ACROSS THE STREET through the window we can glimpse a
frantic MAN emerge from the office building facing the
coffee shop Pudgy balding and short the man is
disturbing primarily due to the large fire-axe hes
gripping in both hands Trent and Robinson havent noticed
TRENT
Relax Robby thats why you’
pay me The human race is
always looking to play an
angle God bless their crooked
hearts Ill always be here to
clean up the mess

While they talk the axe maniac is making progress He is

cutting a reckless path across the street
blindly H

swinging

es heading straight for the shop Trent and

Robinson remain oblivious After all this is New York

ROBINSON
Thats good to hear because I
have a serious mess with
Arcane

TRENT
Who

ROBINSON
(troubled)

- Theyre a publishing
house and theyre our biggest
account They just‘ filed a
claim Could mean millions 1
need you on is as soon as
possible ---

TRENT
(brings his cup

to his lips)

Whats the claim

ROBINSON
(as if telling a
secret)
Sutter Cane is missing

Trent has about half a second to react before the axe
maniac comes CRASHING through the plate glass window He

lands squarely on top of Trents table
coffee all over himself as he and Robins

time to cringe in their seats

For an insane instant all is QUIET
scrambling for the exit
the distance

about before locking eyes on John Trent

Trent splashes
on barely have to

2 gave for a few people
We HEAR an APPROACHING SIREN in
The man with the axe glares frantically

Trent makes the mistake of returning the stare He freezes

in place

ON THE MAN

Its his eyes Theyre off Too big too oily human yet
inhuman Slightly out of proportion The man leans down
towards Trent
MAN

(routine

surprisingly

calm)

Do you read Sutter Cane

ON TRENT
snapping out of it

TRENT
what

The man suddenly REARS UP and SCREAMS as he raises the axe
high above his head Just before he cuts Trent in halt
SHOTS RING OUT and the nan crumples to the surface of the
formica table The axe CLANGS to the floor Trent turns
and sees two city cops outside the shop one still pojnting
the smoking barrel of the gun hes just fired

Trent stares back at the dead mans face The eyes are back
to normal Trent glances over at Robinson whos still
shrunk back into his seat in shock

INT ARCANE PUBLISHING - DAY
CLOSE ON AN ILLUSTRATION

Hyper-real A circle of children in a cemetery at night
All caught in the midst of transforming into something not
human Something wet something weird something with
tentacles A huge shape rises out of the circle huge
beyond belief suggesting something too terrible to be
rendered in more detail The illustration is all the more
disturbing because it looks like a photograph
Underneath we see its title THE LESSON by Sutter Cane

RECEPTIONIST (0S)
Mr Trent

PULL BACK

to REVEAL Trent staring at the illustration He turns
towards the RECEPTIONIST an icy beauty and we see there
are several illustratiiociis aountea along the wall All are
from the works of Sutter Cane A HOBBS END HORROR
standee faces the reception desk

RECEPTIONIST
Mr Harglow will see you now

TRENT
Thanks

Trent heads for the inner office door He pauses and turns
back towards the receptionist

TRENT
(nods towards
standee)
Doesnt that give you the
willies

As the receptionist looks up Trent sees that she was
reading a copy of THE HOBBS END HORROR at her desk She
looks at Trent like hes a retarded child Trent looks at
the book in her hands

TRENT
Guess not

She turns away from him as he enters He just misses the
small trickle of blood which suddenly rolls out one of the
receptionist’s nostrils She self-consciously dabs at it
with a bloody tissue and buries herself back in the book

CcuT TO
INT HARGLOWS OFFICE DAY

A serious stately man in his late sixties HARGLOW motions
for Trent to be seated

HARGLOW
Are you familiar with Arcane
Mr Trent

TRENT
Youre insured by the company

sorry os

STYLES (0S)
(playfully
sarcastic)
Read much we mobhien
Trent turns and sees LINDA STYLES énter the room In her
late twenties she projects a consicerabite combination of
beauty brains and impatience Shes wearing the latest
designer glasses which sit on a face topped off by a head
of flaming red hair Trents immediately attracted to her

TRENT
(shooting back)
I read a book Once

Styles smiles Trents eyes follow her as she takes a seat

HARGLOW
Allow me to introduce Linda
Styles one of our best
editors Lindas been handling
one author of ours
for the past two years
Perhaps youve heard of
hinSutter Cane

TRENT
(playing it dumb)
That horror crap right

STYLES
(a bit offended)
Sutter Cane happens to be this
centurys most widely read
author You can forget Stephen
King Cane outsells them all

HARGLOW
With Sutter Cane weve found
that humanity seems to be
consistently drawn to the
twisted and freakish

TRENT
I know I live in New York
HARGLOW
(smiles)
Well Ive asked Linda here
because she has particular
relevance to this situation

TRENT v
Which is what exactly -

HARGLOW
It is exactly that Sutter cane
vanished without a trace
approximately two months ago
The police have turned up
nothing

TRENT
Who was the last person to
hear from him

STYLES
His agent Cane supposedly
sent him a portion of the new
book not more than two weeks
ago Plain brown wrapper no
return address

TRENT
Whatd the agent have to say
Harglow and Styles exchange looks Trent gets impatient

what TRENT (CONT)
at

HARGLOW
You heard what he had to say
Apparently you were there when
the poor fellow went a
bitdaft in midtown I
believe you saw him shot

TRENT
(lets the
coincidence sink
in)
You mean that lunatic with
axethat was Canes agent

STYLES
Hard to believe isnt it

TO ane

TRENT
Yeah youd think a guy who
outsells Stephen King could “
find better representation

Trent waits for them to laugh Nobody does

STYLES
This is no joke Mr Trent
Canes books have been rumored
to drive less stable readers
off the deep end agents
included - i

TRENT
Howre you holding up

STYLES
(slight grin)
Just fine

HARGLOW
Lindas one of the few editors
brave enough to takeon Canes
work

TRENT
Whats happened to some of the
others

STYLES
(matter of fact)
Severe nausea nigraines
nosebleeds

TRENT

(not buying it)
Nice and you think Canes
agent took one look at Canes
datest masterpiece and went
axe-happy in broad daylight

(suspicious)
Itd be a helluva promotion
for the new bookgreat
publicity

HARGLOW
This isnt a hoax Mr Trent
Surely you believe your own
eyes you were there Besides
we have no desire to publicize
Canes connection to
thisincident we simply
want the man and the book
back Sutter canes franchise

represents eighty-percent of

our income

STYLES
Weve already delayed the new
book by one month Canes fans
are getting a bit restless

HARGLOW
We need to know if Sutter Cane
is alive or dead Obviously
theres a great deal of money
at stake Were already in the
middle of a multi-million
dollar campaign

TRENT
Ill need to see his papers
contracts

HARGLOW
Impossible Canes agent
handled all the legal affairs
a total buffer we dont even
know where Cane lived

STYLES
All we do know is that for a
period before the
disappearance Canes work
became erratic bent More
bizarre than usual He became
convinced his stories were
real not fiction Then the
work stopped coming

HARGLOW
Read his work Mr Trent It
will help you get to know
hin

STYLES
(smiles)
Tt might do more than that

Trent smirks

same thing

TRENT
That our world used to be
inhabited by another race of
beings

STYLES

(nods yes)
Beings who eventually lost
their foothold here and were
expelled Canes books
chronicle these creatures
efforts to get back in
Aside from that theres not
much else to lock for

TRENT
Unless you look like a
detective I did and I think
Cane told us hed pull this
He leaves clues about his
vanishing act in every book
including the last one

Trent pulls out a notebook

TRENT (CONT)

notes)

The main guy in the first book
is a painter talks about
taking a long journey The guy
in the second books a writer
talks about isappearing on
the eve of his biggest
success The narrator in the
last book even talks about
actually moving into HOBBS
END the town where all the
stories take place

This is what your tingling
tells you That Cane went

someplace fictional

TRENT

What my tingling tells me is
that I may be onto another
phony claim Author
disappears into own fantasy
world

(leans in)
You and I both know what a
half decent publicist could do
with a story like that So why
dont we cut this short tell
me where Harglow sent Cane to
lay low and Ill make sure no
one knows you tipped me

STYLES

We told you before Mr Trent
this is no hoax We dont need

Trent is sitting on his couch writing notes into a
notepad There are a few Cane paperbacks littered about
Trent appears to have been up all night Dark circles sit
below his tired eyes He throws his pen down and leans
back rubbing his face with his hands

When his hands come away we see that hes left two black
streaks across his face His pens sprung a leak He
notices the ink on his hands ‘

TRENT
(disgusted)
Beautiful

Too tired to clean himself up he takes out a cigarette and
starts to light Up At the last second he notices that hes
about to light the filter Hes got the cigarette in
backwards he frowns and turns it the right way

TRENT
(exhaling)
Where the fuck did you go
Trent stares at the Cane paperbacks Hes staring at two in

particular Theyre laying side by side on his coffee
table

ON THE BOOKS
“THE THING IN THE BASEMENT and THE BREATHING TUNNEL

Their coversthey seem to fit together like two pieces
of a puzzle

ON TRENT

as he stares at them He rubs his eyes leaving more black
ink around his face He looks like a raccoon He suddenly

breaks from his trance and WIPES everything off the table
with a sweep of his arn

Everything except the two books

He grabs his shopping bag and dumps the other Cane
paperbacks out onto the table He starts shifting then
around turning then over all with great speed and

concentration Hes totally at the mercy of the inspiration
thats seized him

As suddenly as he started he stops Sweating frowning he
stares at his handiwork Disbelief gives way to a thin
snile of admiration

What scares me about Canes
work is what might happen if

How can reality share a

ON THE PAINTINGS

Theyre different- in a subtle disturbing way The cows
grazing in the first painting now appear sickly vith
runny infected eyes The grass seens more brown than
green One cow seems to have sprouted larger teeth

The boy playing with his dog in the second painting appears
less joyful more frightened of his pet The dog itself is
larger

The two lovers strolling by the creek appear unchanged
until you notice that their eyes seem a bit more recessed
into their faces There also seems to be something rising
out of the water behind then All the paintings seen to be
acquiring that hyper-real quality of Canes book covers
