FADE

Screenplay by
Adam Prince

Based on the novel by Robert Cormier

© 2009 Darko Entertainment
From BLACK we fade into a slate green shiny surface
POLAROID FILM

An image burns into the instamatic film surface -- a family
snapshot taken against a shed on a beach in the early ‘70s

Two sets of young PARENTS proudly display their infant boys
and two little girls In the back row between the young
dads stands their brother ADELARD (18 mischievous smile)

His image fades out like a tooth abandoning a perfect smile

Suddenly the type-ball head of an old IBM selectric
typewriter THWACKS against a white page

THE DREAM
Takes us into dark disturbing images of birth
Freaks Oddities of nature

The sky turns angry as a storm fast approaches
The heavens turn blood red Clouds turn into roiling fire

A CHURCH STEEPLE

Glows and ignites As the fire spreads downwards a heart
beats The beats become THWACKS of the typewriter as --

We enter the burning church

INT BURNING CHURCH

We float down the aisle to the altar SMASH CUT TO

AN ELECTRIC TYPEWRITER CARRIAGE

Sliding back to its first position right at us ---- THUD
INT PAUL’S BEDROOM NYC - NIGHT

PAUL MOREAUX’s (mid 30s) eyes snap open as he wakes His
heart-rate SLOWS dangerously His skin grows goose-pimple
cold His breath condenses -- as if the room suddenly got
cold But it didnt the cold is coming from inside him

He bolts out of bed and sits on the floor folding his legs
into a lotus position Presses his palms against the floor
extends his arms lifting himself off the ground maintaining
his crossed legs This brings his heart rate back up

As he hovers we glimpse out his bedroom window ten stories

below barges and tugboats lazily traverse the Hudson River
a slow stream of lights marking Manhattan from the world
Paul drops to the floor exhausted and shivering But
whatever he was afraid of he seems to have fought off

He grasps a St Jude pendant on his night stand whispering

PAUL
Dont do this to me

EXT CENTRAL PARK WEST - NYC - AFTERNOON

Returning from the Central Park Paul jogs through his Upper
West side neighborhood on his way home

EXT PAUL’S BUILDING - AFTERNOON

As Paul finishes his run he notices a LIMOUSINE parked in
front of his building As he walks toward it a beautiful
though frustrated MEREDITH MARTIN emerges in a black
dress -- taken aback by the sight of Paul in his sweats

MEREDITH
You forgot

PAUL
Youre early I’11l get ready fast

MEREDITH
Paul you cant be late
And neither can I

PAUL
Just go Ill take a cab

MEREDITH
Ill wait Its my ass if youre
not there on time

PAUL
Did you tell them no pictures

MEREDITH
I got the photographer’s e-mail
address and contacted him directly

Satisfied Paul goes inside Merediths pissed
INT LIMOUSINE - AFTERNOON

Wearing a suit now Paul gets in and sits across from her as
far as two people can get back here The limo takes off

MEREDITH
You clean up pretty good
PAUL
Thanks

MEREDITH
But I think you missed a spot

She points to his poorly-shaved chin

PAUL
Merry I know this must be awkward
for you I guess we’re both
obliged to go to this thing

MEREDITH
At least I know you got my calls

PAUL
Sorry I haven’t gotten back to you
I’m sure you’re angry

MEREDITH
At first I was justconfused I
thought things were good with us
then I wake up one morning and
you’re gone No note -- just an
empty bed When I didn’t hear back
from you I admit I got angry But
nowI just want to understand
what happened Why did you leave

PAUL
(under his breath)
I didnt
MEREDITH

No I searched every inch of your
place You took off on me and I
havent heard from you since
Paul what did I do

PAUL
You didnt do anything

MEREDITH
Then what happened

PAUL
Is this really the time

MEREDITH
It’ll have to do
(off his SILENCE)
It’s been a month Paul Dont I
deserve some kind of explanation
PAUL
Absolutely butI just dont know
what to say

MEREDITH
Anythings better than nothing

PAUL
Im sorry Merry Trust me --
youre better off without me

MEREDITH
Jesus Paul Every guy in the
world uses that line Of all
people I’d expect more originality

PAUL
If you want to assign another
editor to me Id understand

MEREDITH
Youre going to take that away from
me too

PAUL

No Im just saying it might be
easier for you

MEREDITH
How is any of this easier for me

PAUL

I dont want to hurt you
MEREDITH

Too late
PAUL

Thats not what I meant
Another silence as she tries to understand what he did mean

Paul looks outside at the city going past their window She
realizes shes not getting any more out of him right now

Over this we hear Paul READING his book in a large room
PAUL VO
Stumbling out of the mine shaft
elevator he burst into the world
of air and light

This carries us over to --
A PAINTED PORTRAIT

Of Paul when he was about 15 Bright colors balanced by
thick black lines create a psychologically haunting image
especially in his eyes like he knows some horrible secret

PAUL VO
-the Autumn breeze benevolent
after the heat of Purgatory

This is on a poster for BIG APPLE LITERACY FOUNDATION
fund-raiser Paul Moreaux reads from his National Book
Award-winning Bruises in Paradise

Our view widens to
INT BALL ROOM MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Paul stands at a podium under a spotlight reading to 200
well-heeled New Yorkers who sit in rapt attention Meredith
sits off to the side of Paul beaming with pride

PAUL (READING)

He saw his soot-covered face
recognizing only the eyes staring
back He wondered if his father
had been young like him And he
wondered if he too would someday
become like the mine -- blemished
battered in danger of collapse

Paul closes the book The room breaks into applause
Embarrassed Paul looks to Meredith who claps the loudest

Meredith’s boss -- the SENIOR EDITOR -- gives her a silent
nod of approval then steps up with a microphone

SENIOR EDITOR
How about we take a few questions

Paul didn’t expect this but he rolls with it

PAUL
Let’s do it

Several hands rise He points to nearby LITERARY PROFESSOR

LITERARY PROFESSOR
In your works thus far your
protagonists are men on the

outside looking in
(MORE)
LITERARY PROFESSOR (CONTD)
Haunted by their past capable of
great self destruction if not
destruction of others To what do
you attribute these common threads

FLASH A photographer snaps a picture with a high-end
digital camera Paul turns on Meredith furious The
audience picks up on his consternation FLASH

Paul abandons the podium and walks straight to the
photographer -- FLASH Paul grabs him --

PHOTOGRAPHER
Get your hands off me

Paul pushes him into the swinging door behind him taking
them both out of the ballroom The audience is shocked
though some may wonder if it’s part of an act

The Senior Editor knows it’s not He finds Meredith

SENIOR EDITOR
Get your writer in line

INT LOBBY - NYC BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS
Meredith rushes into the lobby and finds Paul wrenching the
camera away from the photographer He rams a shoulder into

the guy’s chest and knocks him off

MEREDITH
Paul Stop it

Paul pushes buttons on the camera trying to figure out

PAUL
How do you erase on this thing

Suddenly he feels his heart-rate drop He doubles over
The photographer pulls his camera from Pauls grasp

PHOTOGRAPHER
The fucks the matter with you

All sounds start to fade away for Paul as he forces himself
to hyperventilate in order to get his heart rate up

Meredith takes the photographer around the corner

MEREDITH
Are you hurt

PHOTOGRAPHER
No
His camera seems to be checking out too

MEREDITH
I did ask you not to take his
picture

PHOTOGRAPHER

I thought you meant just during the
reading so he wouldnt get
distracted by the flash

MEREDITH
Thats not what I said

PHOTOGRAPHER
Whats the big deal

MEREDITH
To be honest I dont know Hes
not the first of our authors with
an odd request but Mr Moreaux is
important to our publishing company
so we accommodate

INT LOBBY - MOMENT LATER
Meredith comes around the corner holding his MEMORY CARD

MEREDITH
I took care of it Paul

But he is nowhere to be seen She notices one of the doors
to the outside closing Meredith follows and goes out onto

EXT STREET MID-TOWN - NIGHT

Meredith bursts out to the street but sees no sign of Paul
in any direction Frustrated and angry she retreats inside

INT LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
Meredith puts the memory card in her purse

SENIOR EDITOR
Whered he go

Meredith looks up to see her pissed off boss in the Lobby

MEREDITH
Disappeared Again
INT PAUL’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

An elevator opens revealing Paul who walks to his apartment
He sees a manila envelope sitting in front of his door From
Chief Jules Moreaux Monument Police Dept Monument MA

INT PAUL’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Paul shuts the door behind him and opens the envelope
He takes out a small-town newspaper THE MONUMENT TIMES

The stationary attached to it obscures the front page The
note reads Thought youd find this of interest - Jules

Paul opens his closet to reveal a file box were he keeps a
stack of these papers all with a similar note attached

Paul tosses the latest edition onto the stack Hes about to
put the lid back on but something inexplicable stops him

He pulls off Jules note to reveal FIRE RAVAGES ST JUDE’S
The photo of a burning church is what Paul saw in his dream

PAUL
»-Oh god

INT PAUL’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT
A quick series of shots show Pauls urgent departure

Hes online and buys a bus ticket from New York City to
Monument MA He hastily stuffs clothes into a duffel bag

He stuffs a few of his novels into a paper bag Paul grabs
his St Jude pendant off his night-stand and puts it on

He picks up his duffel bag and LEAVES too distracted to turn
off the light Seconds later his home phone rings CUT TO

INT LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

I-phone to her ear Meredith sits in the back of the limo
(alone this time) Paul’s phone rings and rings until she
hears Paul’s voice mail pick up “You’ve reached --” then
there’s a two-second vacuum of silence instead of a message

MEREDITH
Nice message Of course youre not
answering Do you know how much
you embarrassed me and yourself
Youre lucky the photographer
doesn’t want to press charges on

you or sue the foundation
(MORE )
MEREDITH (CONTD)

And for the record I got him to

cough up the memory card so we can

delete the pictures of you

ourselves

(sighs)

I just don’t understand what’s

gotten into you
EXT MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
A PETER PAN bus turns onto the Mass Pike
INT BUS - SAME

Paul sits with an old Polaroid snapshot in hand -- the one
from his dream His young parents and his aunt and uncle each
with their babies and two little girls circa 1970

As in the dream Adelard is missing from the back row

In front the pretty dark-haired girl vamps for the camera

YOUNG YVETTE’S VOICE (0S)
You could tell even then

We’re still looking at the photo but now we’re in --

INT KITCHEN WHERE PAUL GREW UP - EVENING (20 YEARS AGO)
Young Paul (15 now) looks up from the picture to his sister
Yvette as she points at the little girl Her hair and
clothes clue us in to the fact that it’s the mid-1980s

YOUNG PAUL
Tell

YOUNG YVETTE
What a slut she’d turn out to be

Offended Young Paul shuts the photo album with a thud
He takes the Polaroid with him into his tiny bedroom

INT YOUNG PAUL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Paul lays the Polaroid on his cramped desk He sits
and takes out his notebook He starts composing a poem

My love for you is

His pencil pauses unsure what should come next THUD-THUD
Young Paul hears a broomstick tap the ceiling below his feet

Paul understands the signal and goes immediately to the
window He opens it up letting in a draft of chilly air

Paul sticks his hand outside and reaches for the cut-out Coke
can which is attached to the homemade rope and pulley system
between this second floor of the tenement and the first

Paul retrieves the message stuffed by Jules inside the can
Uncle Adelards coming home Paul is shocked and thrilled

He scribbles a response on the back of the note When
EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN (PRESENT)

Adult Paul’s BUS drives through wooded Berkshire county in
western Massachusetts passing a sign Entering Monument

INT BUS - DAWN

Paul looks out the window as they drive by a defunct factory
The Monument Plastics sign is rusty and faded

The gate is chained and locked The parking lot empty
The big brick factory building looks ghostly and abandoned

EXT TOWN SQUARE - MONUMENT MA - MORNING
The bus pulls to a stop in Monuments town square well

before the open of business Paul steps onto the quiet
street and surveys the once familiar territory

Time shifting demographics and economic depression have
altered the face of the town he remembers A few of the
storefronts look vacant boarded up

Paul notices the tires on the nearest car have been slashed
And the glass on the parking meter has been broken In fact
as far as Paul can see they all have

Several of the storefront windows are cracked Other shops
have plywood over windows they cant afford to replace

The best maintained shop sits across the square from Paul
ROSANNA’S BEAUTY The exterior looks recently repainted

Two WORKMEN replace one of the salon’s busted windows
Inside the shop is dark closed at this hour like the others

Duffel bag over his shoulder Paul walks down a side street
We follow him into his old neighborhood of Frenchtown

A block away he sees CHARRED REMAINS of St Judes church

A SCHOOL BUS stops at the smoke-stained St Judes Parochial
a middle school adjacent to the destroyed cathedral

Kids in parochial school uniforms which have seen better days
approach on foot from all directions

CLOSER - CHURCH RUINS

Most of the children stay across the street as they pass the
church as if it were too painful to walk past or haunted

Paul stands before the charred ruins eyes glazed with guilt

PAUL
Shouldve gotten here sooner

As if in response to his muttered confession he hears

FATHER GASTINEAU
God damned shame

Paul turns to see Father Gastineau who doesnt recognize
him The Father fingers his priest collar smiling wanly

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
I shouldnt take the Lords name in
vain but in this case exceptions
are warranted
(puts out his hand)
Father John Gastineau

PAUL
Father its me Paul Moreaux

The priests face lights up

FATHER GASTINEAU
My boy good to see you finally
Ive heard youve made quite a name
for yourself

PAUL
Ive been lucky

FATHER GASTINEAU
(glancing at the ruins)
Perhaps you can share some of it
with our rebuilding committee

PAUL
Ill do what I can

Father Gastineau beckons him past the yellow CAUTION tape

PAUL (CONTD)
You sure we should go in there

FATHER GASTINEAU
Ive been doing it every day since
the fire Visiting the dead

Paul follows him down what was the center aisle past the
blackened remains of the pews Sunlight streams through the
decimated roof rays stabbing through the dusty air

Father Gastineau points to the floor beneath their feet

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
I baptized you right here

A wind whistles through the town and the blackened ruins
Paul feels the skin on his neck grow cold

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
I tell you my boy it was truly a
horrific ordeal

He lights up a cigarette Takes a deep drag

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
Horrific

Our POV switches to someone watching them from amid the
ruins Paul looks over at us but doesnt see anybody

Father Gastineau exhales his smoke and launches into his
retelling of the event this is far from his first time

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
I was teaching my 7th Graders
including your nephews the Nicene
Creed when I started to smell
smoke Not incense mind you
(holding up his cigarette)
And not one of these Wood

Paul walks past a rack of glass votive candles blackened by
the fire The priest points down to the center aisle

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
So I lined the children up here

Mindful of the holes in the blackened floors Paul walks
through the ruins looking for whoever might be watching

He sees the side of the MIDDLE SCHOOL -- each window has a
child looking out of it peering at them

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
I kept them calm and we went
straight to the front exit

The priest walks toward what was once the front door

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
The door wouldnt budge

He sees Paul seems to be focused elsewhere

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
We were trapped

Paul looks over

PAUL
Why was the door locked

Father Gastineau shakes his head

FATHER GASTINEAU
Wasnt Something was wedged
underneath So I figure “go out
the back” But the rear of the
church was already consumed by
flames Now the children panic
Ill be forever haunted by the fear

on their faces I thought This
is it time to meet your lord and
savior Then the strangest thing

happened The front door opened

PAUL
Was someone on the other side

Father Gastineau shakes his head no
FATHER GASTINEAU

As soon as I got the last child out
I looked to see who had saved us

PAUL
The article didnt mention this

FATHER GASTINEAU
Theyre not going to credit divine
intervention

PAUL
Do you

The priest looks around to make sure they’re alone

FATHER GASTINEAU
It was a windy day

He consults his watch time for school Takes one last drag

PAUL
Do you have any idea who set the
fire

FATHER GASTINEAU
I don’t know anyone capable of
thisdestruction

PAUL
Thats not true

The priest looks at him oddly

PAUL (CONTD)
We all have the capacity to do good
and evil We make the choice every
day You taught us that

Father Gastineau nods and drops his cigarette on the charred
floor Extinguishes it with his foot

PAUL (CONTD)
Were all the kids in attendance

FATHER GASTINEAU
Your cousin asked the same thing
I told Jules not to waste his time

PAUL
Were my nephews absent that day

FATHER GASTINEAU
No they were with me Im
surprised you dont know this

PAUL
Im hoping to see my sister and the
kids tonight

FATHER GASTINEAU
Good See if you can get Bernard
to rejoin the team Hes my best
forward

PAUL
So who wasnt there that day

FATHER GASTINEAU
A sickly boy a poor wretch who
wouldnt hurt a fly I assure you

PAUL
Then who do you think did it

FATHER GASTINEAU
Ask your cousin If anyone should
have a clue its him

He picks up the dead cigarette to dispose of it

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
In the meantime the diocese has me
living with the nuns

PAUL
The convent up Mountain Road

The Father cringes as he nods

FATHER GASTINEAU
Dont get me wrong its a nice
place to visit on a bright day
And they have a well-stocked
pantry But I just want to go
back to the way things were

Suddenly they hear a CLINK-CLINK-CLINK

They look over at the rack of blackened votive candles which
shakes as if someone just bumped into it

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
Whos there
(off the SILENCE)
Youre not supposed to be in here
Its a safety hazard

He looks around but sees no one

PAUL
Kids

He ducks under the CAUTION tape back on the sidewalk

FATHER GASTINEAU
Insurance wont cover the entire
cost of rebuilding Stonework is
too expensive these days

PAUL
Like I said Im happy to give

They hear the school bell ring

FATHER GASTINEAU
Thats me
(then)
Bless you son And welcome back

Paul walks away passing more students heading the other way
Paul peers over his shoulder He sees nothing but cant
help but feel that he might not be alone With this
awareness he walks through his old Frenchtown neighborhood
Its more ethnically mixed than he remembers but in many
ways its unchanged Clotheslines loop from house to house
hung with shirts and pants like flags of many colors

Paul enters the FRENCHTOWN INN a small BandB

INT ROOM FRENCHTOWN INN - DAY

Paul enters throws his duffel bag down on the bed Takes
out his cell phone and scrolls to the name Yvette The
ringing phone carries us over to --

EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - SAME

We hear the phone ring inside the second floor of the
double-decker tenement house where Paul grew up

INT YVETTE’S APARTMENT - SAME

Paul’s sister Yvette (now 40) is busy getting ready for work
She sees its Paul on caller ID but she lets it go to the
machine She hears his hesitant voice

PAUL’S VOICE (ON MACHINE)
‘vette it’s your brother Believe
it or not I’m in town Kind of
spur of the moment Anyway I was--

Yvette picks up Much tension and distance between them

YVETTE
Why now Paul

PAUL (ON PHONE)
Hey Yvette I had some business
in the area and well its time

The older sister lets out a caustic laugh

YVETTE
It was time when I got married
Paul It was time when I had
Laura Or the boys

PAUL
Were the boys in the fire

YVETTE
Theyre in 7th grade arent they

PAUL
How are they doing

YVETTE
Back to school Listen Paul I
dont have time to play catch-up
with you Ive gotta go to work

PAUL
Can we get together tonight

YVETTE
Kinda short notice

PAUL
I know but Im here Please

Yvette sighs

YVETTE
Still remember where we lived

PAUL
Come on Vette

YVETTE
Be here at five

PAUL
For dinner

YVETTE
Nothing fancy

She hangs up As she glances towards the front door we go
back in time in Paul’s memory to --

THE SAME APARTMENT - 20 YEARS AGO

Their father LOU MOREAUX (40s) enters the apartment that same
chilly evening carrying a picket sign HIGHER WAGES NOW

Young Yvette and Paul watch him pull off his gloves and hat
face beet red from standing in front of the factory all day

YOUNG YVETTE
Well Is Management coming back
to the table or what

Lou shakes his head Tosses down his gloves in frustration

YOUNG YVETTE (CONTD)
Pop its been over a hundred days

LOU
They dont wanna talk They’re in
bed with Rudolphe Toubert Rumor
has it the bastard’s trucking in
scabs from New Hampshire

YOUNG YVETTE
But they can’t justtake your
jobs can they

LOU
Not if we don’t let them

YOUNG YVETTE
What does that mean

Lou doesn’t say but the implication of violence is clear

YOUNG PAUL
Jules says Uncle Adelards back

LOU
Supposedly

YOUNG YVETTE
When

LOU
Tonight Your Uncle Victors
meeting him at the bus stop

YOUNG YVETTE
Dont sound so excited Pop
Its only been what

YOUNG PAUL

LOU

Young Paul hands his father the Polaroid

YOUNG PAUL
He was supposed to be in this
picture wasnt he Right between
you and Uncle Victor

LOU
How many times you gonna ask me
Paulie

YOUNG PAUL
Well you never tell where he went

Lou is holding something back as he gives Paul the picture

LOU
Adelard was good at disappearing

INT ROOM FRENCHTOWN INN - DAY (PRESENT)

We’re CLOSE on the Picture as Adult Paul sets it down on the
night stand We hear him turn on the shower in the bathroom

INT BATHROOM FRENCHTOWN INN - DAY

Adult Paul takes a hot shower Steam thickens the air

BACK IN THE BEDROOM

The doorknob turns slowly

INSIDE THE SHOWER

Despite the hot water Paul suddenly feels a shiver run
through him He turns it off grabs a towel and puts his
ear to the door Hearing nothing he opens the door a crack
Peers into the bedroom but sees nothing

Except the Polaroid is on the floor

Paul opens the door all the way and slowly makes his way into
the next room He looks around -- to the eye its empty

IN THE HALLWAY - JUST OUTSIDE PAUL’S ROOM
On the other side of Paul’s door The floorboard creaks

Paul yanks the door open and looks out into the hallway as
the inn PROPRIETOR descends the stairs with fresh towels

EXT MONUMENT SQUARE - DAY

Paul walks through town square alive with the everyday
goings on of the town on a weekday

This time he approaches Rosannas Beauty Standing before
the front window he peers into the salon

At 45 Rosanna looks like a movie star hiding out in town

Paul remembers --

EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Paul stands outside the first floor of his tenement
building looking into Rosannas bedroom window

He looks past her shade glimpsing inside at his gorgeous 20
year-old cousin as she brushes her hair in her bathrobe

Paul peels away from the window then looks at the opening
line of his poem in progress My love for you is

With confidence its the right word he adds pure
INT YOUNG ROSANNA’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Young Rosanna notices the top of Paul’s head outside her
window She opens it and sees her embarrassed cousin

YOUNG ROSANNA
Thought I saw someone

YOUNG PAUL
I uh was just about to come in
Through the front I mean

Rosanna waves him in through her window He hesitates

YOUNG ROSANNA
Well Come on in

Young Paul climbs into her window As he does Rosanna gets
her hands on the paper hes carrying and unfolds it

YOUNG ROSANNA (CONTD)
What’s this A love poem

He tries to get it back but she holds it away from him

YOUNG ROSANNA (CONTD)
Who’s it for
(off his SHRUG)
Is she pretty

YOUNG PAUL
Beautiful

She reads his gaze and knows he’s talking about her She
sits on the bed and pats it for Paul to join her Unnerved
by the power of her nubile beauty he sits next to her

YOUNG ROSANNA
My love for you is a whisper in the
night Thats beautiful Paul

She sees his eyes lower to her cleavage She grasps his
hand and to his utter surprise places it on her breast

Young Paul is speechless but Young Rosanna knows how he
feels when she sees hes erect She reaches for his --

-- Suddenly Young Jules opens the door

YOUNG JULES
Uncle Adelard1ll be here any min--

-- Paul quickly retracts his hand from Rosanna’s breast
She moves her hand away more casually Jules is shocked

YOUNG ROSANNA
Forget how to knock Julie

Jules cant look her in the eye pretending he didnt just
see that He turns around and retreats into his room

YOUNG PAUL
Jules

He glances back at Rosanna thrown by her Cheshire cat grin
EXT ROSANNA’S BEAUTY - DAY (PRESENT)

Adult Paul walks away from the salon window before Rosanna
turns and looks toward the street We follow behind Paul as
if we’re the unseen presence that may or may not be watching

We stop as he walks into the Monument Police Station

INT MONUMENT POLICE STATION JULES’ OFFICE - DAY

We start close on a dark oil painting of Frenchtown on the
wall Our view widens to reveal Jules’ office which looks
much like youd expect for a small town Police Chief but for
this and the other expressionistic paintings of the town

Jules (now mid-30s in his Chiefs uniform) is on the phone

JULES
Yeah I got the fax Can the lab
narrow down the possibilities

KNOCK-KNOCK Jules looks up to see a familiar face
Jules brightens and beckons Paul into his office

JULES (CONTD)
(into phone)
Tommy Ill call you back
(hangs up)
I must be seeing things

He comes around his desk The cousins embrace -- despite the
time and distance theres still a deep connection

JULES (CONTD)
Good to see you Paula

PAUL
Ditto Julie

JULES
So what brings you back to our
not-so-fair hamlet

Paul pulls out the article Jules breaks out into a grin

JULES (CONTD)
I’ve been hoping to lure you back
Only took what twenty or so years

PAUL
I had to see it with my own eyes

Jules looks at his cousin with a discerning eye

JULES
That church was a prison to you

PAUL
When we were kids

JULES
Dont tell me youre a church-goer

PAUL
Hardly but that place was a big
part of my childhood

JULES
Every major event of my life took
place there including my wedding
which was beautiful by the way

PAUL
Sorry I missed it Jules Really

Jules decides not to pursue it further

PAUL (CONTD)
So youre sure this fire was set

JULES
We found traces of accelerant
Some kind of paint thinner Were
trying to get more information

PAUL
Anyone could buy that

JULES
Most accelerants can be bought over
the counter

PAUL
Is it related to all the vandalism

JULES
You noticed huh

PAUL
Hard to miss

JULES
I’ve been looking into it

He shows Paul some photographs of broken store windows
(including Rosanna’s Beauty) street lamps parking meters

JULES (CONTD)
Started about a month ago Weve
been looking for the culprit but
our only eye witness account comes
from a vagrant who says the windows
started smashing by themselves

PAUL
By themselves

Jules motions that the guy was drinking

PAUL (CONTD)
Any suspects

Starting to feel encroached upon Jules pulls the file away
JULES
Look -- Ill let you know when we
catch the son of a bitch

PAUL
What about the kid who was absent

JULES
How do you know about him

PAUL
I talked to Father Gastineau

JULES
Poor kids story checked out

PAUL
What do you mean poor kid

JULES
My guy says the kid looked beat up
The dad said he was jumped at
school not the first time Father
Gastineau corroborated but still
we suspect abuse at home Nothing
we can do about it at this point

PAUL
Is it possible the arsonist
couldve been inside the church
Maybe even one of the other kids

JULES
Why dont you leave this to me

PAUL
Maybe I can help

JULES
Paul writing mysteries isnt the
same as solving them
(changes the subject)
So you passing through or what

PAUL
Well Im staying the night

JULES
With your sister

PAUL
Im having dinner there but I got
a room at that little BandB

JULES
A hotel Come on Susie can make
up the couch --

PAUL
-- Thanks Julie But I already
checked in

Jules nods disappointed Paul didnt accept the invitation

PAUL (CONTD)
Anyway I kind of need my own space
these days

JULES
These days
PAUL
Let me ask you one thing about the
fire Who opened the door

JULES
Father Gastineau

PAUL
Is that what he told you

Jules gets up ending this line of questioning

JULES
So when am I gonna see you next

EXT MONUMENT POLICE STATION - DAY
Jules walks Paul to the street

JULES
Send my best to your sister
tonight It cant be easy

PAUL
What cant be easy

JULES
Dealing with three kids by herself

PAUL
What about Don

JULES
You dont know

(off Pauls confused silence)
They separated a few months ago
No surprise really Guy looked
miserable at Christmas

Jules sees that it pains Paul to be so out of the loop

JULES (CONTD)
Im sure shell tell you about it
tonight

PAUL
Speaking of matches made in hell
hows your sister

Pauls hit a sore spot with Jules who shrugs

PAUL (CONTD)
You see her much

JULES
Its a small town I see her all
the time But talk
(shakes his head “no”
Not while shes still married to
that piece of shit

PAUL
Is Toubert still lending money

JULES
And running a sports book and god
knows what else Right under my
fucking nose Hes greased the
assholes of the mayor city
council and the church

PAUL
You cant touch him

JULES
Especially since he started
developing real estate playing
‘pillar of the community Son of
a bitch bought the old factory can
you believe it Gonna gut it and
attract a big box store to move in

PAUL
At least itll make jobs

JULES
Minimum wage part time no
benefits Before you know it
whatevers left of Monuments small
business will be dead n buried
and half the population will join
the ranks of the working welfare
Thanks to my dear brother-in-law

PAUL
I cant believe she’s still with
him

Jules rubs his fingers together as if to say money

PAUL (CONTD)
You think thats all

JULES
Well it aint for the kids ‘cause
they dont have any I swear
thats been my only consolation

PAUL
You and Suzie still trying

Jules nods but doesnt look hopeful He diverts

JULES
Were you planning to see my sister
while youre up here

PAUL
I wasnt planning anything

Jules looks unsure if he believes his cousin
INT YOUNG JULES’ BEDROOM - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Jules enters his bedroom disturbed by what he just saw
between his sister and cousin He sits at his desk picks up
a pencil and refines his drawing in his notebook of Captain
America punching out a steroid-pumped Soviet villain

Young Paul comes in picking up a Fantastic Four comic

YOUNG PAUL
If you could choose which super
power would you want

Jules looks at him and in an unspoken moment knows that Paul
wants to avoid talking about what just happened

YOUNG JULES
Writings so lame in comics

They hear the front door open and Pauls uncle Victor call

UNCLE VICTOR
Jules Rosy

They hear Young Rosannas shouted response from the bathroom

YOUNG ROSANNA
Im washing my hair

INT LIVING ROOM - UNCLE VICTOR’S APARTMENT (20 YRS AGO)

The boys rush into the Living Room where Young Paul’s uncle
Victor ENTERS with Paul’s dad Lou who carries a heavy box

The boys look outside with anticipation as their mysterious
UNCLE ADELARD enters with his duffel bag slung over his
shoulder His broad-brimmed hat is slung low obscuring him

UNCLE VICTOR
Meet your uncle Adelard

Adelard set his duffel down with a THUD takes off his hat
revealing a weathered face seemingly older than his 33 years

Both boys stare at this mythical figure they’ve heard about
for so long but who looks nothing like either imagined

With sunken haunted eyes Adelard glances at Young Paul and
Jules trying to discern something but failing to do so

ADELARD
Hello boys

He holds out his hand The boys stand frozen for a moment
until Lou nudges Young Paul who reaches out and shakes

LOU
That’s Paul That’s Jules

Young Jules shakes Adelard’s hand also silently

Adelard fills the void with a forced smile an unspoken
acknowledgement of the awkwardness of this reunion

ADELARD
I have something for you both

He opens his duffel bag and roots through items not of a
casual traveler but of a man who lives on the road (such as
toilet paper a small gas stove a tattered wool blanket)

As this goes on Young Jules whispers to Young Paul

YOUNG JULES
Thought he was younger

Off to the side a disapproving Lou whispers to Victor

LOU
Lookit him Strung out

UNCLE VICTOR
On what

Adelard takes out a PAINT SET and turns to Young Jules

ADELARD
I hear you’re quite the artist

He hands it to Young Jules whose eyes widen like saucers
As the boy examines his gift Adelard turns to the box

ADELARD (CONTD)
And for you Paul

Young Paul takes the POLAROID out of his shirt pocket and
thrusts it into his uncles hands

YOUNG PAUL
Uncle Adelard -- where did you go

Lou and Victor exchanges a glance and listen for the answer
but Adelard just smiles mysteriously He hands the picture
back to Paul and rips the packing tape off the heavy box

VICTOR
(aside to Lou)
I hope he didnt steal this shit

Adelard takes out an IBM selectric typewriter

LOU
You hauled that from Canada

ADELARD
A writer needs his tools
like any craftsman

Paul can’t believe his eyes as he examines the typewriter
ADELARD (CONTD)
Can you imagine -- going to the
library and finding books written
by our own Paul Moreaux
Lou laughs Adelard sees the pain in Young Pauls eyes

INT JULES’ OFFICE - DAY (PRESENT)

We’re tight on the COMPUTER SCREEN in Jules’ office as he
plays the surveillance video from St Judes -- an angled
view looking down on the front entrance of the church

Its broad daylight The front door opens as if by itself
A moment later panicked 7th GRADERS stream through the door

Jules replays the video but just before he pauses it he
notices a flash of something in the upper corner

Jules slows down the video In the corner of the image the
blur of a HUMAN FORM suddenly appears -- walking away then
turning a corner of the building and going out of view

INT LOBBY PAUL’S BUILDING NYC - DAY

Meredith enters Pauls building raring to confront him about
last night She puts on a smile for the DOORMAN

MEREDITH
Hey Eddie Is he around

DOORMAN
Havent seen him go nowhere And I
been here since six this morning

INT PAUL’S BUILDING HIS FLOOR - DAY

Meredith gets off the elevator and approaches Pauls
apartment Rings the bell but hears no movement inside

She knocks on the door Still nothing But sees light
emanating from the other side She pounds on the door

MEREDITH
Paul

Still no answer She digs into her bag and takes out keys

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Tired of this

INT PAUL’S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Meredith lets herself in calling inside

MEREDITH
Paul

She hears nothing then turns on the lights She hears a

hum

It draws her toward Pauls desk

The clunky IBM selectric typewriter is sitting on the top of
his credenza and its humming because it was left on

Meredith clicks the typewriters power to off

She notices his phone message pad The carbon copy shows the
last thing Paul scribbled Frenchtown B and B 555-3455

She wal
find

lks toward Pauls bedroom door afraid of what she might
She opens the door sees the bed is empty and unmade

Meredith remembers --

A MONTH AGO - HERE MORNING

Meredith wakes up in Paul’s bed looking over to his side and
finding it empty She looks around for signs of him

MEREDITH
Paul

No answer She gets out of bed We FOLLOW as she looks
around the apartmentconfused as she finds no one home

BACK TO THE PRESENT

Meredith turns on the lights of Pauls bedroom Her eyes
fall to the framed photo on his night stand

It’s of her asleep in his bed The other side of the bed is
empty as Paul captures this beautiful intimate moment

Shes so confused Her I-phone beeps with an incoming text
from Paul Had to go to Monument Sorry

MEREDITH
Hes home Who died

INT ROSANNA’S BEAUTY - DAY (PRESENT)
Rosanna unfurls the barbers apron over her new customer

ROSANNA
So What do you like

PAUL
Every now and then a little
poetry How about you

This wouldn’t be the first male customer to flirt with her

ROSANNA
Who doesnt but I meant your hair

PAUL
(reciting his poem)
My love for you is pure
As candle flame As bright as
sunshine As sweet as --

ROSANNA
-- babys breath

She says recognizing both the poem and its writer

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Paulie

She throws her arms around him and whispers in his ear

ROSANNA (CONTD)
I thought you forgot about me

PAUL
Impossible
ROSANNA

Where the hell have you been

PAUL

New York You look great

ROSANNA
Im on my feet all day
havent you visited me

PAUL

Paul why

Ive been inside my head too long
Hazard of my trade I guess

Rosanna lightly tugs at his shaggy hair

ROSANNA
You do need a trim

She picks up a spray bottle and wets down his hair

ROSANNA (CONTD)
I love in Bruises in Paradise when
you say Hell would not be anger

but indifference

PAUL
You read my book

ROSANNA

You kidding All of them

Paul is taken with her just as he was years ago She runs

her fingers through his wet hair

Theres a sensuality about

this that Paul is attuned to which makes us uncomfortable

ROSANNA (CONTD)
To be honest -- I was afraid you
were like the rest of the family

PAUL
What do you mean

ROSANNA

Judging me for my marriage

PAUL

Rudolphe Toubert doesnt exactly
have good history with us

ROSANNA

Rudys mellowed Hes not the

tough guy you remember
(MORE )

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Does a lot for the community
especially St Judes And takes
good care of me

PAUL
Youve got security what else
(off her SILENCE)
Why didnt you two have kids

ROSANNA
A little personal dont you think

PAUL
Im family

ROSANNA
It wasnt in Gods plan

PAUL
I never thought you of all people
would become churchy

Rosanna smiles knowing what he means Her bad girl past

ROSANNA
I like going Being connected to
something outside my little world

The shop phone rings Rosanna answers

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Rosanna’s Beauty Yes Rudy
No of course not --Rudy how
many times do you need to hear it

Paul tenses listening to this

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Im sorry its just
(looks away from Paul)
Im with uh a customer
No no I didnt mean--
-Of course youre my priority

The grip Toubert has on Rosanna makes Paul sick She hears
the ding of her door as it opens and closes Paul is gone

EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)
Coming from the reunion with his uncle Young Paul lugs his
typewriter up the STAIRS on the side of the building At the

top he waits for his dad to come up and open the door

Down below as Lou approaches a hulking man named OMER
LaBATT (30s) steps into the light cutting him off

OMER LABATT
Hey there Lou

LOU
Omer How ya been

OMER LABATT
Tryin’ to get by Listen Mister
Toubert’s gettin’ impatient

LOU
You collecting for him now

Omer nods not proud of this fact

OMER LABATT
Not too many other opportunities
since the factory laid me off

LOU
I’m still hangin’ in what with the
strike and all

OMER LABATT
Don’t hold your breath Look
gimme half now I’11 talk to him

LOU
I don’t have any money coming in

OMER LABATT
Then I’m sorry Lou Real sorry

He PUNCHES Lou in the gut Lou doubles over breathless

LOU
--Ten years we worked together

OMER LABATT
I know but orders is orders
I got two other mouths to feed

Omer knees Lou in the face Lou goes down nose bleeding
Omer hates to do this but he KICKS Lou in the back

A potted plant flies down at Omer He ducks it but a second
pot is thrown right at his head

Omer deflects it --SMASH-- the pot explodes on his arm
Pottery and soil go flying and Omer shouts in pain

Grabbing his arm a pissed off Omer turns his sights on Young
Paul standing frozen at the top of the stairs Young Paul
tries to get back in the apartment but the door is LOCKED

As Omer stomps up the stairs a desperate Young Paul slips
through the banister and jumps down to the ground -----------

THUD Young Paul lands hard hurting his knee

He hears Omer clomping back down the stairs but Young Paul
is physically unable to run away

Terrified he scrambles under the stairs Then it happens
His racing breath and thumping heart slow to a STOP All

sound fades out His body seizes up he cries out in pain
His breath condenses as if it suddenly got frigid out here

INSIDE - SAME

Adelard stands with a beer in his hand looking over Young
Jules’ shoulder as he examines the paint set

ADELARD
Careful with the paint thinner
its flammable --

-- He suddenly feels his heart slow precipitously like a car
slamming on the breaks He drops the beer

Hearing a THUD Young Jules turns around but Adelard is GONE
BACK OUTSIDE - SAME

Omer reaches the bottom of the stairs and comes around to the
other side He looks underneath the stairs into the
shadows Gets a good look but no ones there

Like his Uncle Adelard Young Paul seems to have disappeared
EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Standing under those very stairs Adult Paul feels the cold
wind on his neck as leaves and debris whip up around him

He feels as if he’s being watched Paul looks around

He slowly peers around the back of the building

WOOF WOOF WOOF A pit-bull mix flings itself toward Paul
jaws snapping Paul jumps back falling

The dog reaches the end of the chain around his neck--THUNK
On the ground but safe by inches Paul looks up to the second

floor of the tenement house -- up to the window which was
once his -- where a boys shadowy figure looks down on him

MOMENTS LATER

The paper bag packed with Pauls books He snatches it up
from under the stairs and takes them up to the SECOND FLOOR

He stands before the front door that was his knowing that on
some level he has become Uncle Adelard Paul knocks

Yvette opens up Looking past the doorway Paul takes it in
The apartment of his youth looks different yet the same

YVETTE
Youre letting the cold in

INT YVETTE’S APARTMENT (PAUL’S CHILDHOOD HOME) - CONTINUOUS
Paul steps inside They seem to be the only ones here

PAUL
Where are the kids

YVETTE
Where else

She heads off toward their rooms

PAUL
Vette wait a sec I saw Jules
today He told me about Don
Hethought I already knew

Yvette laughs to herself -- Like youd know anything

PAUL (CONTD)
Are you okay

YVETTE

Its best for both of us
PAUL

Hows Don
YVETTE

Relieved I think Hes renting a
place in Pittsfield He always
hated the commute from here anyway

Paul turns the conversation
PAUL

So the boys have been through a
lot lately
YVETTE
Laura too Its hard enough being
a teenaged girl

PAUL
But the fire
YVETTE
Theyre tough like Pop
PAUL
Hows their health
YVETTE
Whatd Jules tell you
PAUL
Nothing
YVETTE

Then why do you ask

PAUL
Theyre the only ones carrying our
familys genes into the future

YVETTE
Ha Bernards taken the separation
pretty hard Been having trouble
in school He should be at the gym
right now playing basketball but
he quit the team And Armand
well get things under control

PAUL
Whats wrong
YVETTE
Doctors think he has Wilsons

Syndrome
(off his SILENCE)
Chronic low body temperature

This strikes a chord with Paul

YVETTE (CONTD)
He gets cold sometimes and just
slows down The doctor’s putting
Armand on a course of hormones

PAUL
Which ones

YVETTE
What are you an endocrinologist

PAUL
Just an uncle

YVETTE
Now you decide

EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Paul comes out from under the stairs and sees Uncle
Adelard sitting on the stairs legs crossed waiting for him

ADELARD
You just did it didnt you

Now when he looks at the boy Paul’s got an AURA around him

YOUNG PAUL
Did what

Adelard smiles He points to Paul’s front shirt pocket

ADELARD
That picture You could say its
the reason why Im here

Paul takes the Polaroid out again sets it on a railing

YOUNG PAUL
So where were you when Grampa
snapped it

ADELARD
Playing a prank

YOUNG PAUL
Oh

The boy looks away somewhat disappointed

YOUNG PAUL (CONTD)
I always thought you

He cant bring himself to say it aloud for fear of sounding
childish He hears Adelard finish his thought

ADELARD (0S)
Disappeared

Young Paul turns back to his uncle but Adelard is not there

YOUNG PAUL
Uncle Adelard W-Where did you go

Suddenly he sees the Polaroid lift off the railing and fade
away within seconds until it’s completely disappeared too

Young Paul’s eyes widen with amazement As he blinks and his
lids re-open they reveal Adelards reflection in his corneas

Paul finds his uncle sitting in front of him exactly as he
was a moment ago with the Polaroid in his hands Adelard
stares back with the saddest eyes Paul has ever seen

YOUNG PAUL (CONTD)
-H-How

ADELARD
How did you do it

YOUNG PAUL
I-I didnt

ADELARD

You didnt feel your heart stop
Pain didnt shoot through every
nerve in your body Every inch of
your skin didnt feel prickly

(off Paul’s NOD)
Felt was like you stepped into a
meat locker right And it felt
that way until you came out of it
Thatll never change And if
youre anything like me youll
never get used to it

YOUNG PAUL
(realizing)
That’s why Omer didn’t see me

ADELARD

Its called The Fade like color
gone from old cloth

(then)
My father’s cousin Theo had it
And before that Theo’s Uncle And
so on It comes to a male in
every generation in our family
some time during adolescence

YOUNG PAUL
Why
ADELARD

My best guess -- weve got a
recessive gene makes a pheromone
that covers our body and somehow it
affects the pathway of light But
like I said Just my theory

(then)
I do know that your clothes and
whatever’s on your body will fade
with you And if you’re in the
fade and pick something up

YOUNG PAUL
It disappears

ADELARD
As you saw yes But not
instantly so be careful

YOUNG PAUL
I couldnt see you but
I could feel you

ADELARD
That’s the trick of it You can
move about the world unseen but
people will sense you Be careful

YOUNG PAUL
Uncle Adelard why’d you choose me
ADELARD
I didnt
(then)
See I was having these dreams I

didnt understand them at first
but then I realized It was time

YOUNG PAUL
For what

ADELARD

The new fader It was either you
or Jules I didnt know right
away In fact you hadnt come
into it -- until just now

(then)
Now you have the Glow just like me
when Theo told me it was my time

He looks around -- no one can see them

ADELARD (CONTD)
Do it

YOUNG PAUL
It justhappened

ADELARD
Close your eyes Clear your mind
of all distractions Then lean
into a wall that isnt there
Paul closes his eyes and --
-- A frightened Young Yvette comes outside interrupting

YOUNG YVETTE
The scabs Theyre coming

INT YVETTE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (PRESENT)

We’re CLOSE again on the Polaroid -- TIGHT on a young Lou and
Victor and the space between them once occupied by Adelard

YVETTE (0S)
Your uncle

Paul looks up as Yvette comes in with her daughter LAURA
(13 bookish) Paul offers his hand

PAUL
Im Paul

LAURA
I know

She bypasses his hand and to his surprise hugs him

LAURA (CONTD)
Its nice to meet you

Paul sees behind her -- one of his 11 year-old nephews

PAUL
Bernard

Armand seems half a beat behind

ARMAND
--He’s in there Im Armand

YVETTE
Armands like you Paul Spends
most of his time holed away in his
room scribbling away
PAUL
So youre a writer
(off Armand’s SHRUG)
What do you write

ARMAND
Comics

YVETTE
I always tell him Paul I thought
that’s what you’d end up writing
And Jules would draw the pictures
But it didn’t turn out that way

PAUL
Armand you like superheroes

ARMAND
And bad guys

PAUL
Sometimes it’s hard to tell the
difference
(off Armand’s SILENCE)
The best ones have secrets

ARMAND
I guess

PAUL
So your mom tells me sometimes you
get cold suddenly What happens

ARMAND
I dont get cold Im always cold

PAUL
What about your heart
Does it everslow down

Armand shrugs

YVETTE
Its always a little slow but the
doctor’s gonna fix that

(calls toward the bedroom)
Bernard

(to Armand)
Get your brother

Armand gets up from the table So does Paul

PAUL
Ill go with him

INT BOYS’ BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Armand brings Paul back into the room that was once his

No one’s here apparently But Armand opens the closet
revealing his brother BERNARD (also 11) playing a 1st person

shooter video game on his PSP

Bernards got an eerie fixation on the game shooting people
with precision as he moves through a high school corridor

Paul waves his hand across Bernards face He looks up

PAUL
Hey Im --

-- Bernard gets up abruptly and walks past him out the room
INT YVETTE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bernard now sits at the dining room table with Paul Armand
his sister Laura and his mom Paul says to the kids

PAUL
I wanted to give you something

From his paper bag he pulls out his novels -- Bruises in
Paradise Come Home Come Home Dialogue at Midnight

LAURA
You really wrote these

PAUL
Well thats what I do

Lauras impressed But Armand and Bernard leave the books on
the table -- utterly disinterested

BERNARD
Can I be excused

ARMAND
Me too

Yvette nods and the boys go back to their activities Laura
breaks out into giggles Yvette sees Paul is mortified

YVETTE
Theyre eleven year-old boys
What did you expect

LAURA
Don’t worry Ill read them

PAUL
Thanks

Seeing his disappointment Laura goes over to her brothers
LAURA
Why dont you play hide-n-seek with
Uncle Paul

Armand shrugs “sure” but Bernard pays no attention

LAURA (CONTD)
Come on Bernard he hasnt been
here in a long time so he doesnt
remember the good spots

Paul remembers --
INT THE APARTMENT DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Were in Young Pauls Fade POV as he moves UNSEEN into the
living room where Uncle Adelard talks to his older brothers
Lou and Victor Lou has an ice pack on his face

ADELARD
Manufacturing is moving overseas
Today its Mexico and Central
America tomorrow --

Adelard senses Young Pauls presence and looks right at “us”

ADELARD (CONTD)
Tomorrow it’1l be someone else

LOU
So were supposed to roll over

VICTOR
Let Toubert break our union

As the men continue to argue Pauls Fade POV moves
through the living room down the HALLWAY into

INT YOUNG JULES’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Young Jules is trying out his new paints for the first time
The largest tube (white) starts to move then disappears

Young Jules looks over and cant find the white paint
He spins around but sees no one else in the room

Young Jules feels the presence of something he cant explain
but it does feel a little colder in here

He tries to find that missing tube of white As he looks on
the floor the tube appears right next to Jules palette

Jules sits up and sees the white tube right in front of him
As Jules tries to understand Pauls POV backs out into

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Paul’s fade POV rests at the BATHROOM door We hear the
SHOWER running The door handle turns as if by a ghost

The door opens slowly until we see Young Rosanna (obscured by
a translucent curtain) shaving her legs under hot water

INSIDE THE BATHROOM
In the shower -- the COLD WATER faucet turns “by itself”

Young Rosanna shrieks She re-adjusts the faucets As she
resumes shaving her legs the hot water faucet turns off
entirely leaving the shower trickling

Rosanna feels our presence but she cannot see us Hands
shaking with fear she slowly brushes the curtain aside

YOUNG YVETTE (0S)
(from the hallway)
PAUL

Rosanna grabs a towel yanks the bathroom door open and bolts
into the hallway Yvette looks at her dripping wet

YOUNG YVETTE (CONTD)
Im guessing you havent seen him

Rosanna gives her a dirty look A cold breeze blows through
Yvette opens the bathroom door and sees the window is open

YOUNG YVETTE (CONTD)
Close the window it’s freezing

Rosanna is frigid standing there in the draft Yvette gives
her pretty cousin a disdainful look then walks away

YOUNG YVETTE (CONTD)
PAUL

EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Yvette comes around the side of the house The
bathroom window’s still open She sees no signs of Paul

YOUNG YVETTE
Where the hell did you go

Young Paul emerges from the shadows under the stairs
EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Adult Paul is in the same spot -- counting -- with his eyes
shut as the boys scamper in all directions Hide-n-seek

INT YVETTE’S APARTMENT - SAME

Adult Yvette and her daughter watch from the second floor
window Despite the built-up hostility toward Paul Yvette
enjoys watching him play with her boys OUTSIDE

EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - SAME

Paul first looks under the stairs and sees condensed breath
He reaches into the dark but no one’s there

Did he really see that WIND flows through the neighborhood
rusty fences The clothes on the lines flap violently

Paul turns up his collar Is it just the wind hes feeling
AROUND THE BACK

The chained up pit-bull mix looks confused sitting there as
he tracks an unseen presence across the ratty back yard

The dog whines confused and unsettled Paul comes around
the corner The dog turns on Paul and starts growling

ARMAND
(loud whisper)
Toby no

Paul looks up to the FIRE ESCAPE above him He cannot see
his nephew clearly because hes glowing

Then again hes standing under the broken light fixture with
a bare bulb Paul climbs up to the fire escape bringing
himself face-to-face with his nephew

He reaches out and turns the hot light-bulb until it’s off

ARMAND (CONTD)
Whatre you doing

Paul sees he does not have The Glow He restores the light

PAUL
Nothing

He sees the pulley from his communication system with Jules
The rope and can are long gone but the pulley is still
intact (albeit rusty) Paul spins the wheel with his finger
He glances toward the opened window

PAUL (CONTD)
Did your brother go inside

Armand nods mischievously Paul climbs inside his old room
INT BOYS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Its empty Paul opens the closet This time empty

INT YVETTE’S APARTMENT

Paul looks through the rest of the apartment -- Lauras room
Yvettes room the bathroom the kitchen where the girls sit

PAUL
Where did he go

YVETTE
Bernard We’ve been sitting here
the whole time

LAURA
We haven’t seen him

PAUL
But you heard him

They both nod Paul walks into the hallway looks up at the
hatch in the ceiling

INT ATTIC - TENEMENT HOUSE (PRESENT)
Paul climbs up and sees Bernard playing his PSP
INT KITCHEN YVETTE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Paul sprays whipped cream into the ice cream-filled bowls of
Yvette’s kids then sprays some into his own mouth

ARMAND
Me me me

BERNARD
Me too

As Paul obliges he sees a smiling Yvette ENTER with a camera
to capture this candid moment She raises it to her face --
PAUL
Wait

Alarmed Yvette stops Paul takes the camera from her

PAUL (CONTD)
I want one of you four

YVETTE
Okay

Yvette crowds in with her kids Paul snaps a picture

PAUL
Beautiful

A close look on the viewer shows all of them clearly

PAUL (CONTD)
‘vette will you send this to me

YVETTE
Of course Pauly

The boys leave the room with their Sundaes

PAUL
You have great kids

YVETTE
Hopefully someday you will too

PAUL
Why hasn’t Jules

YVETTE
Theyve tried a long time now
Shes young but something isnt

PAUL

YVETTE

Paul knows his sisters just holding a grudge

PAUL
Why didnt she have kids

LAURA

YVETTE
Laura

LAURA

PAUL

But her beauty parlors right in
the Square isn’t it

YVETTE
I get my hair done in Pittsfield

She gets up and ushers young Laura out

YVETTE (CONTD)
Get your brothers to bed

Alone with Paul now Yvette says how she really feels

YVETTE (CONTD)
God doesnt want Rosanna to have

kids
PAUL

Funny thats what she said
YVETTE

You saw her
PAUL

Is that a crime
YVETTE

After what happened to our father
PAUL

(stands )

Ive gotta go
Afraid she pushed him away Yvette says

YVETTE
Paul Seeing you with the kids
it was really nice

PAUL
Like it shouldve been always

Yvette is surprised to hear him say this

PAUL (CONTD)
Im sorry I havent been around

YVETTE
Will you be back Or are you just
like Uncle Adelard
EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - NIGHT (20 YEARS LATER)
Young Paul sees fear in Yvette’s eyes as she approaches
YOUNG YVETTE
Pop’s going to the factory
There’s gonna be a fight

Suddenly Pauls father emerges from his brothers apartment
on the first floor followed by Adelard

ADELARD
Lou you cant beat history

Disgusted by his brothers attitude Lou turns to his boy

LOU
Stay with your sister

Paul nods Lou turns to join his older brother Victor

ADELARD
Be careful

Lou responds with a look of disapproval before he heads off
with Victor to the factory and the fight that awaits them

Yvette starts up the stairs looking down at Paul

YOUNG YVETTE
You coming in or what

YOUNG PAUL
In a minute

She goes up the stairs and into their second floor apartment
Left alone with Adelard Paul follows him to the FRONT PORCH

YOUNG PAUL (CONTD)
You have to help them

Adelard picks up his duffel bag

YOUNG PAUL (CONTD)
Where are you going

ADELARD
I cant get caught up in this

YOUNG PAUL
You could be a hero

Adelard quickly envisions --

EXT FACTORY - DAY (ADELARD’S VISION)

The scabs approaches the factory armed with pipes and chains
FAST CUTS as an unseen blade slashes their necks mowing them
down amid confusion and gore -- until Adelard is partially
visible because hes covered in so much blood

BACK TO SCENE - OUTSIDE TENEMENT

Adelard walks onto the sidewalk and turns away from the
factory -- like an alcoholic walking away from a bar

Young Paul catches up to him

ADELARD
Only bad things come of the Fade
You cant save people with it
Youll be lucky if you can save
yourself

PAUL
But itsincredible A gift

Adelard stops in his tracks and makes this very clear

ADELARD
I never called it that

Paul looks sobered by his uncles response
INT HALLWAY ST JUDE’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT (PRESENT)

The priest sees a basketball rolling slowly across the court
Father Gastineau looks around but doesnt see anyone He

Mr Moreaux
(catching his breath)
Fancymeeting you here

PAUL
Sorry father Im working on
getting your star forward back

FATHER GASTINEAU
Good on you my boy We need him

Paul picks up the basketball and shoots it
The ball bounces off the rim Father Gastineau tsks

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
Power comes from your legs

Paul passes it back to him The priest shoots -- swish
Paul retrieves the ball and passes it back to him

PAUL
Father who was the boy absent the
day of the fire

FATHER GASTINEAU
--Why

PAUL
Its for my new book About a boy
born different than the rest
An outsider Others see this as
weakness Some prey on him Does
that sound familiar

INT LIBRARY ST JUDE’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT

From darkness --CLICK-- Father Gastineau turns on a light in
the school library Now were in Father Gastineaus office

The rest of the school is dark and dead quiet
He locates the St Judes Parochial YEARBOOK

FATHER GASTINEAU
This is from last year

He opens the book and shows Paul but we do not get to see
it Paul looks disturbed by what he sees
FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
His name is Oscar Slater The kids
call him Ozzie but I dont think
he likes it

PAUL
What happened to his nose

FATHER GASTINEAU
Poor wretch Victim of the system

PAUL
The school

FATHER GASTINEAU
Christ no man Foster care

A light-bulb goes off for Paul

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
He bounced around home to home
One abuser or dysfunction to the
next until he landed with the
Slaters Margaret was a lovely
church-going woman enrolled Oscar
here She was already sick but
didnt know it until it was too
late I believe Oscar filled a
void left by her husband and his
affair with the bottle I cant
imagine how hes coping raising
the boy by himself -- especially
now since he was laid off

PAUL
So who are his biological parents

The priest looks away and closes up the yearbook

FATHER GASTINEAU
How should I know

PAUL
Where did he come from

FATHER GASTINEAU
Sisters of Mercy He was given up
as a baby

PAUL
By whom

FATHER GASTINEAU
Ive only been living there a week
Youd have to ask someone who was
around then like Sister Anunciata--

-- The lights go out

FATHER GASTINEAU (CONTD)
Must be on a timer

EXT HALLWAY ST JUDE’S MIDDLE SCHOOL - NIGHT

Paul finds his way out of the dark library He looks down
the long hallway and sees the silhouette of a lanky
ADOLESCENT BOY in street clothes Paul walks toward him

PAUL
Oscar

He walks faster The kid looks up suddenly scared

BOY
Youre not Father Gastineau

Its dark Paul cant make out his face

PAUL
Are you Ozzie

The boy winces in response shaking his head “no”

BOY
Hey what happened to the lights

EXT SLATER HOUSE - NIGHT

Paul walks up to the front of a small ramshackle house in
Monument The name Slater on the mailbox next to the door

Paul knocks He hears something behind him Paul looks
around sees no one The skin on the back of his next grows
cold as if the wind were whipping up but the air is still

Suddenly behind him the front door gets ripped open
A huge man fills the doorway This is BILL SLATER 40s

SLATER
What do you want

Paul can smell the booze on his breath from here
Slater leans against the door jamb to keep steady

PAUL
Im here to talk to your son

SLATER

PAUL
Nothing bad But I understand hes
been missing school lately

SLATER

Slater steps back to close the door

PAUL

INT SLATER HOUSE 2ND FLOOR - SAME

Oscar’s POV looks out the window down at Paul as he walks
away from the house We hear Slater’s heavy boots

SLATER
Goddamnit boy Im sick and tired
of answering questions about you

Oscar’s POV pans over to catch him coming up the stairs
taking off his thick leather belt and folding it over as a
weapon Slater reaches the top but doesn’t see Oscar

SLATER (CONTD)
Where the helld you go

Ozzie’s POV moves past him down the stairs and OUT the door
EXT FRENCHTOWN STREET - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Adelard (duffel bag slung over his shoulder) and Young Paul
walk toward Monument Square mid-conversation

ADELARD
For years I worried what would
happen if the next fader were
someone whod Well use it for
terrible purposes

YOUNG PAUL
Not me Youve got my word

ADELARD
Dont make any vows

They reach the Bus Stop at one corner of the Square
Adelard sets his bag down They sit on the bench

YOUNG PAUL
Is it really just some random gene
There has to be more to it I
mean why would God do that

ADELARD
God
(shrugs unsure)
I’ve asked myself for a long time
if theres a higher purpose to
this But I havent found it

YOUNG PAUL
Of all the families why us

ADELARD
Moreauxs have always been simple
people We were peasants in
France farmers in Canada factory
workers here Then theres me a
drifter But you -- youre
different Paul Youre going to
be educated A new beginning

Young Paul feels burdened by the expectation but accepts

Paul nods

ADELARD (CONTD)
I know its tempting Paul but you
cannot tell a soul Do you
understand me No one

Adelard checks his watch looks for the bus

ADELARD (CONTD)
There are a couple more things you
should know First avoid having
your picture taken When youre in
the Fade there wont be an image
But even when youre not in the
Fade film won’t capture you right
not anymore But most of all Paul
-- use the Fade only when
absolutely necessary

Paul holds out the Polaroid challenging

it

YOUNG PAUL
Like this

ADELARD
That was stupid of me Reckless

YOUNG PAUL
I dont see what the big deal is

ADELARD

Its tempting to Fade all the time
To move among the world like a
ghost The power it’s incredible
but it comes at a price

(off Paul’s look)
When you’re in the Fade you get
these urges They can take you
over It has a life of its own

YOUNG PAUL
How often do you Fade

Adelard doesn’t answer but his eyes tell him too much

ADELARD
I pray your experience is different
than mine but be very careful

Young Paul nods nervous

ADELARD (CONTD)
Paul if there is a mission in all
this it’s to find the next fader

YOUNG PAUL
What if I cant

ADELARD
I felt the same way when Theo said
this to me He told me Id know
what the signs mean when they came
to me and he was right

Young Paul nods again trusting him despite his fears
They hear the rumble of a BUS as it approaches the Square

ADELARD (CONTD)
Find the next fader Paul
Find him and warn him

The PETER PAN bus pulls up

FF

ADELARD (CONTD)
Don’t forget your responsibility
After you the cycle will go on
The bus door opens with a THUNK Adelard climbs aboard

Paul lays in bed staring at the Polaroid -- at the 5 year-
old Rosanna vamping for the camera as he remembers --

EXT MONUMENT SQUARE - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

The door to Adelard’s bus closes As it rumbles out of the
square Young Paul watches his uncle leave town for good

The roar of the bus becomes distant returning the Square to
silence Then he hears the heel-clicks of a woman walking on
the other side of the Square Paul sees its Young Rosanna

Despite the late hour shes made up for a date
She walks the deserted streets with purpose

Feeling as if someone’s following her she looks over her
shoulder but sees no one CUT TO

YOUNG PAUL’S FADE POV

Following her using the Fade despite Adelards warnings
EVENTUALLY

Rosanna walks down 4th Street to the nicest house in town

Paul’s POV stops as Rosanna walks past the Mercedes in the
driveway The sign on the garage reads TOUBERT ENTERPRISES

A young RUDOLPHE TOUBERT (30s small-town gangster with
big-town style) opens the door and kisses her hungrily

Toubert looks out like he knows hes being watched but upon
seeing nothing he steps back inside shutting the door

Young Paul materializes out of the Fade utterly devastated
EXT SLATER HOUSE - LATE NIGHT (PRESENT)

Were watching the Slaters house from a distance slowly
PUSHING IN throughout this scene We see into a window --
the curtains drawn but we can only make out the shadowy
figures Slater looming over Oscar as we track closer

SLATER (IN SILHOUETTE)
Teach you to run out on me

We see a violent movement and hear SMACK of the leather belt
against skin We hear Oscar cry out in pain then sob

SLATER (CONTD)
Stop your crying

WHACK
OSCAR (IN SILHOUETTE)
--I cantif you dont stop
hitting me
WHACK Suddenly the silhouette that was Oscar DISAPPEARS

SLATER (IN SILHOUETTE)
How did you do that

Now weve reached the window looking in past the break in
the curtains A bewildered Slater appears to be alone

But suddenly -- out of nowhere WHAM -- Slaters struck
by an unseen force that sends him to the floor

Blood pours out of his head Half-lidded eyes hold no life

about to knock on it -- to explain himself to her -- but he
thinks the better of it and walks back down the steps

EXT MONUMENT DINER - MORNING

This diner on Monument Square could be from an Edward Hopper
painting except for the plywood in place of a broken window

Meredith sits across from Jules

MEREDITH
I dont want you to think Im some
crazed ex-girlfriend

JULES
Why would I think that

MEREDITH
Its not exactly around the corner
to New York

JULES
When I visited Paul you guys

MEREDITH
We were just friends then and
colleagues Things changed just
in the last few months

JULES
Even then I thought you two had
potential

MEREDITH
Youre not the only one

She grins darkly Jules sees what Paul would see in her

MEREDITH (CONTD)
I can handle Paul breaking up with
me But Im worried about him
Something is definitely off

JULES
“Off”

MEREDITH
He’s beenerratic The other
night he shoved a photographer and
grabbed his camera

JULES
Why

MEREDITH
Paul asked that his picture not be
taken but the guy did it anyway

Jules doesnt get it

JULES
Some people are camera shy but

MEREDITH
Paul is a freak about that Thats
why we use that creepy painting of
yours instead of a publicity still

JULES
Im flattered So why do you think
hes been ducking you

MEREDITH
(shrugs then)
Im guessing its related to why
hes here

JULES
Hes here because of the fire

MEREDITH
What fire

JULES
Someone torched the church where we
went as kids

He points out the window Meredith can see part of the burned
down church a block away Suddenly she hears Paul --

PAUL (0S)
You two look awful cozy

She turns to him Paul looks pissed seeing them together

JULES
I don’t need it I told you

PAUL

He unhooks the receiver from his shoulder and speaks into it

JULES

The color drains from Paul’s face as the responsibility for
this comes crashing down on him Jules notes his response

PAUL
Sounds personal

Meredith ventures forward We FOLLOW her as she looks
through the window -- glimpsing the large splayed out body
Bill Slater on his floor She turns away in horror

PAUL (CONTD)

JULES
A kid couldnt take down a man the
size of Slater

PAUL
If he doesnt see him coming

Paul

He points for her to make a right turn She does

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Are you going to tell me where

PAUL
To find out more about him

MEREDITH

Rebuffed Meredith shakes her head and drives in silence

INT SISTERS OF MERCY CONVENT - DAY

SISTER ANUNCIATA exits her office marked “PRIORESS”
where she’s met by a YOUNGER NUN

SISTER ANUNCIATA
Be sure to change Father
Gastineaus bedding every day
plus leave him a fresh towel

YOUNGER NUN
And a mint on the pillow

The prioress cracks a smile

SISTER ANUNCIATA
He’s been through a lot recently

They hear FOOTSTEPS on the stone floor but when Sister
Anunciata looks to see who it is no one is there She
continues walking with her younger charge

SISTER ANUNCIATA (CONTD)
As far as meals go we should cut
down on his salt

As they walk away we see the door to her office open and
close for the second time but no one seems to be there

YOUNGER NUN
Oh Sister theres someone here to
speak with you

Sister Anunciata comes over to Paul

SISTER ANUNCIATA
Can I help you

PAUL
May we speak in private

INT SISTER ANUNCIATA’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

A pair of hands rifles through Sister Anunciata’s files
They stop finding one of interest labeled Oscar Slater

Suddenly the doorknob squeaks as it turns
The manila folder falls to the ground

The door to the Sisters single bathroom opens and shuts --
just as Sister Anunciata enters with Paul from the hallway

SISTER ANUNCIATA
Father Gastineau never fails to
mention he baptized a famous
author

She turns on the lights and they enter Paul feels the skin
on his neck grow cold He rubs his neck looking around

Sister Anunciata points to the pendant around Pauls neck

SISTER ANUNCIATA (CONTD)
Thats lovely

PAUL
Father Gastineau gave it to me at
confirmation

SISTER ANUNCIATA
People erroneously say Jude is the
saint of lost causes

PAUL
Isnt he

SISTER ANUNCIATA
Desperate not lost
(shuts the office DOOR)
So -- you have your privacy

PAUL
I came to ask about Oscar Slater

SISTER ANUNCIATA
(stiffens defensive)
What about him

PAUL
I understand he was brought here as
an infant

SISTER ANUNCIATA
(nods then)
But let me be clear -- Sisters of
Mercy is not an orphanage We were
responding to an extraordinary
situation within the community

PAUL
And what was that

SISTER ANUNCIATA
I cant get into details with you
but when someone leaves a child on
your doorstep literally or
figuratively its incumbent upon
me to place him in a home After
that its in Gods hands

PAUL
Or some lousy foster parent

SISTER ANUNCIATA
We did our best

PAUL
Who were his real parents

The sister looks at him sternly

SISTER ANUNCIATA
You know I cant tell you that

Paul notices the dropped manila folder on the floor under
her desk lying open and empty Are his eyes deceiving him
Hes sees that it is in fact labeled Oscar Slater

SISTER ANUNCIATA (CONTD)
The rules of the state not to
mention the seal of the cloth
prevent me

Paul looks over at her bathroom at the slit of space between
the stone floor and the bottom of the door

PAUL
Yes of course sister

SISTER ANUNCIATA
May I ask what is your interest in
the boy

PAUL
Excuse me may I use your restroom

SISTER ANUNCIATA
The toilets on the blink

PAUL
I only need to wash my hands

SISTER ANUNCIATA
Very well

Paul goes over to the door and opens it -- no one seems to be
there but Paul feels an overwhelming sensation

Suddenly hes shoved aside -- thudding against the door jamb
A second later the door to the HALLWAY gets thrown open

SISTER ANUNCIATA (CONTD)

Paul brushes past the confused nun and rushes out --

WHAM A gash appears across his cheek as hes struck down
Oscar remains unseen but he’s right there

I’ve regretted ever since It
turned me into a monster I
promised myself -- never again

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)
You don’t know what you’re talking
about You’re goddamn liar

He trips Paul who falls on his back holds his hands up

PAUL
Your skin tingles all over as your
heart slows down and the whole
world seems to juststop Pain
shoots through your body and you
get cold down to your bones

Silence which Paul takes as Oscar listening

PAUL (CONTD)
Then there’s the urges They can
make you do things you wouldnt
otherwise do like set fires

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)

this life

Paul holds his arms up to protect his face --

Toubert comes to the window of the garage door and looks
outside as the second flatbed passes also honking

Outside Young Paul slips away from Touberts property and
runs off toward the factory A third truck rumbles past him

Rosanna appears over Toubert’s shoulder awed and frightened
by the small army he amassed to descend on the factory

Knowing these men will go up against her father her uncle
their people Rosanna lowers her head in shame

What is that

Paul opens it up It’s a TRANSFER OF GUARDIANSHIP
His eyes widen seeing the names Rudolphe and Rosanna Toubert

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Where did you get this

PAUL

He must’ve stolen it
MEREDITH

You mean you stole it
PAUL

No

She looks concerned -- things may be worse than she imagined

MEREDITH

Lets get you back to the hotel and
get some ice on that okay

We FOLLOW her as she walks around the corner of the convent
as a concerned Sister Anunciata comes out

MEREDITH (CONTD)
I-I’ve got it under control

SISTER ANUNCIATA
Whats wrong with him

MEREDITH
Hes not himself at the moment
but Ill take care of it

She takes out her I-phone Looks up Jules number but when
she tries to call she gets NO SERVICE here atop the mountain

Paul comes around the corner Sees Meredith and Sister
Anunciata whos shocked by the gash across his cheek

PAUL
Thank you for your time Sister

INT MEREDITHS SAAB DRIVING - DAY

A thick silence as Meredith drives Paul down the mountain

PAUL
Our last night together I want
you to know -- I didnt leave
MEREDITH

So you said
FLASH TO INT PAUL’S BEDROOM NYC - ONE MONTH AGO

Meredith wakes up in Paul’s otherwise empty bed but this
time we see this from Pauls Fade POV watching her

MEREDITH
Paul

Getting no answer she peers into his bathroom but doesn’t
find him Paul’s Fade POV follows her as she searches in
vain for him She’s not alarmed just confused

Suddenly she turns around and stares at “us” feeling Paul’s
presence but not understanding what’s really going on

BACK TO SCENE MEREDITH’S CAR (PRESENT)

MEREDITH
At first I thought maybe you went
for a run I waited for --

PAUL
-- For three hours You made
yourself coffee complained I
didn’t have decaf Then you called
your mother discussed her physical
therapy but then she got a call
from your sister so you let her go
Then you read an article about
Parisian fashion in the --

MEREDITH
-- How do you know all this

PAUL
Merry I told you I was there

MEREDITH
Where were you hiding And why

Paul hesitates This is big He decides to forge ahead
PAUL
I have a uh a condition

MEREDITH
Condition Likea disease

PAUL
Sort of But when I first got it
I thought it was a gift

MEREDITH
Is it physical or psychological

PAUL
--Both Its called the Fade

MEREDITH
Ive never heard of it
PAUL
Its rare
MEREDITH
How rare
PAUL
It only runs in my family
MEREDITH
-Only your family
PAUL
As far as I know
MEREDITH
Is it curable
PAUL
No
MEREDITH

The doctors said that

PAUL
It’s not that kind of thing

MEREDITH
I-I don’t understand

PAUL
It’s hard to explain

MEREDITH
Try

PAUL
You’re going to think

MEREDITH
What
(off his SILENCE)
Paul Just say it What is it

Paul doesn’t know how

MEREDITH (CONTD)
This”Fade” lets you to be ina
room with me only I can’t see you

PAUL
Yes

MEREDITH
Like a ghost

PAUL
Not exactly If you touched me
youd feel me

MEREDITH

This this is insane
PAUL

It sounds that way but it’s not
MEREDITH

Paul -- you’re telling me you can

become invisible

PAUL
I know
MEREDITH
It’s not possible
PAUL
It is
MEREDITH
How
PAUL
I don’t know I justcan
MEREDITH
So -- do it
PAUL

Meredith laughs darkly

MEREDITH
Come on Paul You can’t just tell
me you’ve got this power and not
show me I want to see it

PAUL
I don’t do it anymore

MEREDITH
You just said you did a month ago

PAUL
Not by choice

MEREDITH
You’re not making any sense

PAUL
I need you to listen to me
Meredith Listen and don’t judge

MEREDITH
Youre not making it easy

PAUL
I know how this sounds That’s why
I’ve never told anyone I haven’t
faded by choice since I was a kid
Since I first came into it

MEREDITH
Why Hell if I could I’d do it
all the time --

PAUL
-- There’s a cost
MEREDITH
A cost
PAUL

At St Judes they taught us every
day we choose to do good or evil
Create or destroy A or B Those
choices define us make us human

Meredith nods unsure where hes going with this

PAUL (CONTD)
What if you could no longer choose
(off her puzzled look)
Somethingcompels me

MEREDITH
To do what

PAUL
B

Meredith grows even more concerned by his cryptic revelation

PAUL (CONTD)
Ive fought it for years Put it
in a box locked away Almost let
myself forget about it Then one
day the lid opened

MEREDITH
This one day was

PAUL
A month ago

Meredith realizes this is why Paul disappeared on her

PAUL (CONTD)
Id been having these weird dark
dreams for weeks but I didnt
understand them Or didn’t want
to But that night was different
I woke up and went into the Fade
for the first time in twenty years
I was terrified you’d wake up next
to me and know

MEREDITH

But why then After all that time
PAUL

Its when Oscar came into the Fade
MEREDITH

Oscar
PAUL

The next fader Hes just like me

MEREDITH
You didnt kill anybody

Paul feels terrible but chooses not to correct her

MEREDITH (CONTD)
What does Jules think of all this

PAUL
He doesn’t know
MEREDITH
I thought it runs in your family

PAUL
One person in each generation
Only the faders know When it was
my time my uncle came back to find
me That’s why I’m here to warn
Oscar But I put it off and got
here too late

MEREDITH
Its not like it’s your fault
PAUL
Everything hes done is my fault
(then)
He needs my help
MEREDITH
You need help
PAUL
Merry --
MEREDITH

-- Not the kind I can give you I
just don’t know what to do for you

PAUL
You can choose to believe me Even
if you don’t understand you can
believe that I wouldn’t be saying
this if it weren’t true That’s
all I’m asking of you

MEREDITH
Youre asking a lot

PAUL
I get that it sounds implausible
that it rests on me doing something
I claim I can do but wont

MEREDITH
You can solve that pretty quickly

PAUL
I don’t want to risk it

MEREDITH
What’s the worst that can happen

He doesn’t want to say She shakes her head in

disbelief

PAUL
How else can you explain how I knew
exactly what you were doing in my
apartment when waiting for me

MEREDITH
You saw the newspaper open to that
article You know I like regular
coffee and you never have it You
know I talk to my mom all the time
Paul you know me better than
anyone I thought I could say the
same about you

He knows its hopeless Stopped at a red light Meredith
sees shes got a signal on her I-phone She calls someone

PAUL
Who are you calling

MEREDITH
Jules Maybe hell know what to --

PAUL
-- You cant tell him Meredith
You cant tell anybody

She hits SEND on her phone but Paul rips it out of her hands

PAUL (CONTD)
This was a mistake

MEREDITH
What

PAUL
Trusting you

Paul gets out of the Saab

MEREDITH
Shit Paul

He tosses the phone back in the car and slams the door shut

MEREDITH (CONTD)
PAUL

He walks behind her car Another car HONKS at her to get
going She looks in her rear view and sees Paul turn down an
alley and go out of sight She slams the wheel frustrated

EXT MONUMENT STREET - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Paul runs to Monument Plastics catching up with Young
Jules both terrified for their dads and the impending fight

YOUNG JULES

You asked me before whose power

Id want The Torch Id burn

those fucking scabs to the ground
Paul says nothing of his new power They turn a corner see
OUTSIDE THE FACTORY
Violence has already broken out Illuminated by the trucks
headlights FACTORY WORKERS and SCABS battle Shadows shift
in the dusty shafts of light Fists Clubs Fear

A grotesque ballet of amateur combatants punctuated by
grunts and groans that punctuate the otherwise eerie quiet

Young Jules scans the mess trying to spot their fathers
Young Paul looks at the battle murder in his eyes

He sees a FACTORY WORKER fall nearby Paul eyes the short
lead pipe in his hand which he used for a weapon

Young Jules spots his uncle Lou Looks back for his cousin

YOUNG JULES
Paul Over here

But Paul is gone

We CUT TO the fallen factory worker An unseen force pulls
his short lead pipe out of his hands It DISAPPEARS

Young Pauls Fade POV moves through the melee

We hear his breath as he STRIKES DOWN scabs left and right
breaking ribs with unseen blows No one sees him coming

He single-handedly turns the tide of the battle
Pauls POV spots his father in the melee Without thinking

YOUNG PAUL (0S)
Dad

Lou looks over distracted by his son’s disembodied voice
Hes struck in the back of the head by a sawed off bat

Everything seems to slow down suddenly as Lou lies on the
ground a pool of blood growing around his head

Young Pauls Fade POV pulls away as he stumbles away
while others start to cluster around his father

UNCLE VICTOR
Call an ambulance

ANOTHER FACTORY WORKER
Too late lookit him

Pauls Fade POV recedes past Jules whos looking for him

YOUNG JULES
Paul Where are you

INT ROSANNA’S BEAUTY - DAY (PRESENT)

Rosanna is blow-drying an OLD LADY’s hair as Paul enters
clearly agitated and intense Seeing the gash on his face
Rosanna turns off the blow-dryer

ROSANNA
What’s wrong Paul and what
happened to your face

Paul ignores her question as he locks the front door

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Whatre you doing

Intent on securing the salon he strides past her heading for
the back door Rosanna turns to her client

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Mrs Rosario would you mind if I
finish you up over there

She points to the old-school dryer The old lady sits
underneath it and Rosanna turns it on The dryer is loud --
the old lady cant hear their conversation

Rosanna goes over to him as he locks the back door

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Why are you locking my doors

PAUL
You didn’t tell me the truth

ROSANNA
What do you mean
PAUL
You had a child

ROSANNA

Rosanna sinks into one of her chairs trembling

ROSANNA
No It’s not possible

PAUL
Anything’s possible

They lied to you

Rosanna shakes her head “no”

ROSANNA
Why
PAUL
“Rudy” never wanted kids did he
ROSANNA
So
PAUL

Didn’t want the inconvenience The
loss of your undivided attentions

ROSANNA
You don’t know him

PAUL
Made a hefty donation to the church
in exchange for a sham burial

ROSANNA
Thats my husband youre talking
about whether you like it or not

PAUL
I don’t

ROSANNA
I don’t care How dare you Get
out Get the fuck out of my salon

PAUL
Take a look at this first

He takes out the document and tries to hand it over but she
whacks his hand away and it falls to the ground

PAUL (CONTD)
What’re you afraid of The truth

After a moment Rosanna picks it up and unfolds it She goes
numb as she reads the Transfer of Guardianship

ROSANNA
Oh Jesus

PAUL

Is that really your signature
ROSANNA

No
PAUL

Figures The lines look unsteady
Your husband must’ve forged it

ROSANNA
-He’s really alive

Paul nods A shaken Rosanna turns towards Paul

ROSANNA (CONTD)
What’s what’s his name

PAUL
Oscar He has your eyes

Tears well up in Rosanna’s face Paul holds her in his arms

ROSANNA

keys and head for the door but finds it locked

ROSANNA
Why is this locked
PAUL
For your protection
ROSANNA
Rudy’s gonna need protection from

PAUL

I’m not talking about him

ROSANNA

PAUL

She’s stunned Paul gently puts his hands on her

PAUL (CONTD)
Let me protect you

ROSANNA
I need to speak with my husband

She unlocks the door and walks outside As Paul watches her
get into her Mercedes he takes out his cell phone and dials
Jules As she drives off Paul gets Jules’ voice mail

PAUL
Jules call me immediately We
need to talk about your sister

INT BATHROOM TOUBERT HOUSE - DAY

Toubert (now late 50s still dangerous) goes through the semi-
daily agony of take a piss Sweat pours down his reddened
face A vein pops out of his forehead As he clutches one

of his kidneys we see a GRISLY SCAR scar from long ago

Finally we hear the release stream into the bowl but it does
little to alleviate Touberts pain

Out the window he sees Rosannas car pull up fast

TOUBERT
Fuckin’ finally

INT TOUBERT’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Toubert wipes the sweat from his forehead as he comes out of
the bathroom Rosanna ascends the stairs to this floor

TOUBERT
Rosy wheres my lunch already

ROSANNA
What happened to our son

Taken aback by her question Toubert finally asks

TOUBERT
What medically I dont remember
exactly it was so fast Something
to do with his heart not being
right Why are you even asking

ROSANNA
I just had an interesting
conversation with my cousin

TOUBERT
Your cousin who
ROSANNA
Paul
(off his BLANK LOOK)
Paul Moreaux the writer

TOUBERT
Since when do you talk to him

ROSANNA
He just showed up in town

TOUBERT
He’s not staying here

ROSANNA
Hes at the Frenchtown Inn but
thanks Hes just my family

TOUBERT
Since when has your family said or
done anything good for us

ROSANNA
He says our boy is still alive

TOUBERT
Exactly what Im talking about A
bunch of lies trying to poison us

Rosanna pulls out the document and unfolds it for him
Toubert cant quite hide the surprise on his face

ROSANNA
That is definitely your signature
and definitely not mine

Toubert stands up tall flashing a charming smile

TOUBERT
Rosy

ROSANNA
Dont No more lies Rudy

TOUBERT
You were just opening the shop and
I knew how much that meant to you
to make good even with me staking
it How could youve pulled it off
with a baby on your hip

ROSANNA
So its true then My sons alive

TOUBERT
He was when I left him in Father
Gastineaus hands

Rosanna takes this all in its overwhelming

ROSANNA
How could you do this to me

TOUBERT
I was looking out for you and your
dreams -- which youve been living
for the last twenty or so years
Havent I given you a good life

She nods He holds up the Transfer of Guardianship

TOUBERT (CONTD)
This was so long ago
(he CRUSHES it)
It changes nothing

Rosanna shakes her head in disagreement turns to the door

TOUBERT (CONTD)
Rosanna where you going

ROSANNA
Leaving

TOUBERT
What about lunch

ROSANNA
Fuck you and your lunch Rudy
If you cant see that THAT --
(points to document)
-- changes EVERYTHING then I
I cant be with you anymore

She tries to open the door but Touberts arm comes into view
shutting the door He leans in front of the door

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Get out of my way

TOUBERT
You dont wanna do this

ROSANNA
Why are you going to send Javier
to work me over or would you have
the balls to do it yourself

Toubert smacks her hard She looks at him with disgust

TOUBERT
You know what I do for a living I
am not a gentle man But in all
these years this is the first time
Ive laid hands on you But you
can push a man just so far

ROSANNA
Move

TOUBERT
Fine go Just know Im shutting
down your credit cards The cars
in your name so I cant report it
as stolen but youve got a week
before the next lease payment

ROSANNA
None of that means shit to me now

Toubert opens the door for her

TOUBERT
It will

Rosanna walks out Toubert watches her get into her car

TOUBERT (CONTD)
Youll be back by dinner

INT FRENCHTOWN INN - DAY

Meredith climbs the stairs passing Paul’s room She sees an
envelope by his door A child’s scrawl reads UNCLE PAUL
Curiosity gets the better of her and she picks it up

The envelope is unsealed She opens it and pulls out a
photograph of a smiling Yvette and her three kids

Something clicks in her mind
INT MEREDITH’S ROOM FRENCHTOWN INN - MOMENTS LATER

Meredith’s in-room coffee maker percolates as she extracts
the MEMORY CARD she confiscated from the photographer

MOMENTS LATER

Click click click Meredith moves from one picture to
another on her laptop until she stops at an image of --

A BLURRY FIGURE standing at the podium Everything around
him including the podium is crisp The next picture

Paul moves towards camera but once again hes blurry while
everything thats just as far from the lens is crystal clear

The third picture Pauls blurry figure looks monstrous as he
reaches toward “us” confronting the photographer

Merediths mouth hangs slightly agape as she processes the
possibility that Paul may have been telling the truth

Outside the windows winds blow through the trees

A draft flows through the inn and sucks Merediths door shut
startling her She takes a deep breath -- she’s jumpy

Suddenly she hears the sound of the dead-bolt sliding shut

Meredith turns around and sees no movement But a closer
look shows that the dead-bolt in her door is fully engaged

She looks around the room feeling somehow no longer alone

MEREDITH
Paul

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)
Guess again

MEREDITH
Oh God it is true Oscar

She reaches out for him groping around the room like a blind
person -- only she can see everything but him

Oscar’s POV ducks and bobs just out of her grasp He laughs
amused by her fear and inadequate attempts to cope

MEREDITH (CONTD)
W-What do you want from me

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)
Can he or cant he
MEREDITH
Can he what Fade I don’t know
Suddenly a lamp flies off the table -- SMASH She screams
OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)

Liar

Meredith lunges for the door and unbolts it but the unseen

force of Oscar hooks her neck and throws her

Her back slams against the wall She’s cornered

MEREDITH
H-He says he can

His unseen foot slams into her sternum doubling her over

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)
“Says” He’s a liar too

Meredith gasps for air

OSCAR (0S) (CONTD)
You know what I do to liars

Meredith’s reaches for the coffee pot grasps it and swings

wildly -- SMASH -- the glass shatters on Oscar’s face

He screams For a second the hot coffee reveals contours of

his pained face until the liquid goes into the Fade

Meredith charges past him unbolts the door and runs out

EXT SLATER HOUSE - DAY

Paul arrives at the crime scene but this time theres only

one cruiser Paul slips past the tape and peers inside

He

sees the blood stain and chalked out figure on the floor

He hears the clomping of footsteps coming up from the

basement Officer McAllister carries up cans of a flat tin
squeeze container of Lacquer Thinner Hes on the radio

OFFICER MCALLISTER (INTO RADIO)

Guys got tons of this stuff Must
put in floors for a living Could
be our accelerant Okay I’1l
send it to lab for comparison

McAllister hangs up He sees Paul in the living room

PAUL
Im looking for my cousin

OFFICER MCALLISTER
Chiefs back at the station

Pauls mobile rings Seeing that its Meredith he picks up

MEREDITH (0S - ON PHONE)
(shaken)
Paul He was here

EXT FRENCHTOWN INN

As Paul approaches the Inn with urgency Rudolphe Toubert
waits for him at the front porch

TOUBERT
You Paul Moreaux

PAUL
Yeah why

A BLUR behind Paul as someone jumps out and hits him between
the shoulder blades with a blackjack He falls to his knees

Paul looks up at Touberts right-hand man JAVIER (late 20s)
as he kicks Paul in the chest sending Paul flying into the
building Toubert now appears and looms over Paul

TOUBERT
Who the fuck are you to come here
talkin’ shit to my wife

PAUL
She could’ve been a mother
You robbed her --

-- Toubert explodes with a downward punch to the bridge of
Pauls nose -- CRACK Paul cries out holding his face

Oscars Fade POV watching the confrontation from the street

Meredith comes out of the safety of her locked car and rushes
over -- but Javier grabs her She struggles

TOUBERT
I dont care if shes your cousin
Stay clear of Rosanna or well see
what else gets broken
(turns to Meredith)
Your boy better get the fuck outta
Frenchtown

He shoots one last look at Paul then starts toward his
Mercedes Javier backs away then catches up with his boss

Meredith kneels next to Paul She feels terrible

MEREDITH
I’m sorry I doubted you
Paul sits against the foundation holding his bleeding nose
He watches Toubert and Javier get in his car and drive off

EXT TOUBERT’S HOUSE - NIGHT (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Paul’s Fade POV watches Young Rosanna emerges from the
garage with the younger gangster in his terry cloth bathrobe

They kiss goodbye Young Toubert pats Rosanna on the ass
before she walks off He goes back into the garage

INSIDE TOUBERT’S GARAGE HOME OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Toubert feels someone elses presence but sees no one but
himself His phone rings He picks up on speaker phone

YOUNG TOUBERT
Yeah what’s going on

FLUNKIE (0S - ON SPEAKER PHONE)
We got a problem One of the
factory workers got whacked in the
head real bad It don’t look good

YOUNG TOUBERT
You gotta crack a few eggs to make
an omelette

We hear Pauls breathing as he cannot contain his anger
Young Pauls Fade POV looks at Touberts knife

Toubert hangs up As he takes a swig of Mylanta he sees his
knife inexplicably float up from the counter then DISAPPEAR

Toubert thinks hes seeing things

YOUNG TOUBERT (CONTD)
Gotta get some sleep

He hears the blade fold out of its body and CLICK into place

Toubert backs away from the presence He hears Young Paul’s
stifled laugh With shaking hands a confused and frightened
Toubert opens a drawer and pulls out a 38 REVOLVER

Young Pauls POV as he steps toward Toubert violently
We hear the blade pierce the flesh of Touberts body

The GUN clatters to the concrete floor as Toubert seizes up
from the initial blow then falls backwards

His robe opens revealing the wound above his kidney As his
body hits the floor a knife appears (no longer in Pauls
hands) in that wound sticking out of Touberts body
We hear Young Paul’s terrified labored breathing Suddenly
the side door to the garage office OPENS its Omer LaBatt

OMER LABATT
Boss I heard --

He freezes seeing his employer lying on the floor bleeding

The gun lifts from the floor disappearing Omer can’t
believe his eyes Then suddenly -- BAM A GUNSHOT rings
out seemingly from nowhere hitting him in the chest

Omer falls back then crumples to the floor A crimson
floret appears on his chest as he bleeds profusely

Young Paul comes out of the Fade hyperventilating and
shaking violently as he surveys the carnage he created

Omer writhes on the floor screaming in agony Young Paul
stands over him looking for some way to help

Omer suddenly grabs Young Paul by the shirt and pulls The
boy slips on the blood now spilled on the floor and falls on
top of Omer He rolls off covered in the man’s blood

YOUNG PAUL
I’m s-sorry S-so sorry

But Omer looks up at him with lifeless eyes

Snot runs down Young Paul nose crying and trembling as he
works through his sheer PANIC to cover his tracks

Using a paper towel to avoid leaving prints he puts the gun
in Touberts hand and the knife into Omers setting up a
different impression of what went on here We FOLLOW him

OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

As he heads down the driveway we look through the garage
window -- back inside to see that Toubert stirs still alive

EXT MONUMENT PLASTICS FACTORY - DAY (PRESENT)

Touberts Mercedes pulls up to the front gate Javier jumps
out opens the lock unwraps the chain and opens the gate

INT FACTORY - MOMENTS LATER

Toubert and Javier ENTER the one-time heart of this town
The factory floor is dark but for the dusty shafts of light
screaming through the yellowed windows landing on dormant
cob-webbed machines for products never to be made again
TOUBERT
A retailers gotta walk in and
imagine all their shit everywhere
so clear this place out

Javier points at the injection molding machinery

JAVIER
Sell it all

TOUBERT
Too dated These machines are
worth more as scrap Bring ina
flatbed and haul it to the junkie

They hear a sound a chain clinking and clanking

TOUBERT (CONTD)
Somebody here

JAVIER
I didnt see nobody when we pulled
up but maybe someone took up here
Times is bad yknow

TOUBERT
Yeah well I didnt just buy a
fuckin hotel Take a look around
and if you find anyone you dont
have to be nice Just get ‘em out

Javier nods Toubert grimaces with pain

TOUBERT (CONTD)
Wheres the john

JAVIER
Saw one on the way in

Toubert shuffles off Javier hears a door open somewhere
He investigates the sound He hears a voice whisper --

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)
Over here

Javier looks around a large molding machine but sees no one

JAVIER
Yo you best get outta here

He looks but still can’t see the trespasser

OSCAR (0OS CONTD)
Here
Javier spins around Suddenly an unseen object SLAMS into
his face -- SHATTERING his front teeth

Toubert hears the sickly THUD and Javier hit the floor

TOUBERT
Javi

He looks back toward the factory floor and sees Javier
writhing on the cement clutching his face in agony

Toubert flicks the blade of his knife open Listens for the
attacker’s whereabouts But its quiet until he hears a tool
clatter to the floor on the other side of the factory

Toubert carefully moves to the exit and pushes on the bars
to open the double door but someone has taken the CHAIN from
the front gate and wrapped it around the outside of the door

Trapped Toubert looks for another way out Using machines
as cover he makes his way to the other side of the factory

Chains hanging from the ceiling start to sway all over the
factory clanking into each other in an unnerving cacophony

OSCAR (0OS - IN THE FADE)
You’re next

Toubert backs up his knife held at the ready

TOUBERT
Who are you

Suddenly a wrench materializes out of nowhere flying right
at his face Toubert ducks and it just nicks his shoulder

Confused and frightened he tries to go in another direction
but once again another tool materializes out of nowhere and
comes flying just in front of him cutting him off

He looks at the swirling dust in the shafts of light He can
hear breathing Toubert spins slashing with the knife

BAM Something unseen has struck his right hand The knife
drops to the ground An unseen foot kicks it away

BAM Something strikes the side of his knee blowing it
out Toubert screams clutching his leg as he crumples

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)
You throw away garbage Forget
about it like it never existed
Suddenly Oscar materializes out of thin air -- a big wrench
in full swing -- WHAM -- hitting Toubert in the cheek

OSCAR (CONTD)
But I do I do exist

From the floor we see his legs and the wrench firmly gripped
in his young strong hand (NOTE we never see Oscars face
throughout this scene though Toubert does)

TOUBERT
S-son
(breaks down)
I-Im sorry Pleaseforgive me

Oscar slams the wrench into the side of Touberts skull
killing him instantly As his body rolls over Oscar strikes
Touberts face (off-screen) again and again and again

We hear Oscar crying as he mashes his biological father into
non-existence Finally he stops out of exhaustion

We see his hands rubbing his prints off the handle and toss
the bloodied wrench to the ground next to Touberts body

Seeing that Toubert pissed himself in death Oscar giggles

OSCAR
Our Father who art in Hell right
about now God-damned be your name
you fraud of a human being

He picks up Toubert’s knife and pockets it as he leaves We
hear the rear exit door open as Oscar leaves the factory

JAVIER

INT FACTORY FLOOR MONUMENT PLASTICS - AFTERNOON

Paul stands over Toubert’s corpse For a split second we see
the gangsters face is pulverized There are no features
left Nothing but coagulated blood and bits of bone

Meredith sits to the side unable to take in the sight

MEREDITH
What a horrible way to go

PAUL
He broke the union grew fat off
its blood He got what he
deserved It was long overdue

INT SISTERS OF MERCY - LATE AFTERNOON (PRESENT)
Rosanna approaches the Young Nun

ROSANNA
Excuse me I was told Father
Gastineau is staying here

YOUNG NUN
Is he expecting you

ROSANNA
No Sister But Im a parishioner
He knows me and my husband well

She and the Young Nun walk past the dark convent KITCHEN
INSIDE THE CONVENT KITCHEN

We hear movement and see the pantry door seemingly close by
itself Click The light turned on inside

INSIDE THE PANTRY

Oscars hands use Toubert’s knife to slice a hunk of cheese
We never see his face but he’s on the floor eating greedily

INT CHAPEL SISTERS OF MERCY - LATE AFTERNOON

Rosanna ENTERS finding Father Gastineau in prayer He looks
up and sees the familiar face and lights up with a big smile

FATHER GASTINEAU

FATHER GASTINEAU
How could I forget Such a
devastating loss

ROSANNA
Did you bless my boy

FATHER GASTINEAU
Of course I anointed him too
He went straight to heaven

ROSANNA
What contribution did my husband
make to the parish that year

FATHER GASTINEAU
Generous I would imagine My
dear what seems to be the problem

Rosanna glances toward a wood carving of crucified Christ
ROSANNA
Would you swear before our savior
that my child went into the ground
FATHER GASTINEAU
--I-I dont take the Lords name
in vain
Rosanna sees the lie on his face
INT KITCHEN SISTERS OF MERCY CONVENT - LATE AFTERNOON
Sister Anunciata enters the dark kitchen and sees the faint
outline of light around the pantry door Going to turn off
the light she opens the pantry

It’s seemingly empty but she notices Toubert’s knife lying
open on the floor amid some cheese and a mess of crackers

Confused she picks up the knife and set it on the counter

She finds a dustpan and broom and returns to the pantry to
sweep up the mess She notices the knife is no longer there

INT CONVENT COURTYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Rosanna exits the CHAPEL Father Gastineau on her heels
FATHER GASTINEAU
Rosanna wait

She nearly bowls over Sister Anunciata

SISTER ANUNCIATA
Excuse me

Rosanna doesnt stop Father Gastineau catches up

SISTER ANUNCIATA (CONTD)
Where’s the fire

FATHER GASTINEAU

Sister this is between me and
Mrs Toubert

SISTER ANUNCIATA
I suggest you attend to it quietly

ROSANNA
Thats okay Were finished

EXT CONVENT - EARLY EVENING

As Rosanna strides out to the parking lot of the convent we
see its dark and foggy on this high-altitude site

She gets into her Mercedes tries to get the key in but her
hands are shaking so much She starts sobbing

INT MEREDITH’S SAAB DRIVING - EARLY EVENING
Merediths Saab drives up Mountain Road

MEREDITH
It does seem like an incredible
gift Just think what good you
could do with it My god

PAUL
I cant save anyone with the Fade
Ill be lucky if I can save myself

MEREDITH
But cant you control it

Paul shakes his head “no”

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Have you tried
PAUL
I only brought on the Fade one
night when I was a kid I thought
I was doing the right thing but

MEREDITH
What happened

His silence tells her whatever happened was tragic

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Can’t you try again

PAUL
The urges were like a rip-tide I
dont want to be pulled out to sea

EXT TENEMENT HOUSE - EARLY MORNING (20 YEARS AGO)

Young Paul arrives at his familys double-decker Young
Jules bolts out the front door of the bottom unit

YOUNG JULES
Were you at the hospital

Young Paul shakes his head no only then noticing hes got
blood on his hands He shoves his hands in his pockets

YOUNG JULES (CONTD)
My pop just called from there
They operated on your dad

YOUNG PAUL
-He’s alive

YOUNG JULES
Doctor says he’s gonna make it

Conflicting emotions wash over Young Paul -- his fathers
alive eliminating his reason for having just killed

INT ROSANNA’S MERCEDES PARKED AT CONVENT - SAME

Rosanna pulls herself together and turns the car on She
tries to back out but the cars stuck She gets out closes
the door and walks around to the other side of the car

OUTSIDE HER CAR

She sees beneath her passenger-side rear tire -- a ROCK
wedged under it She wiggles it out of her tires path

When she goes back around the car Rosanna doesn’t notice
that one of her driver-side doors isnt closed all the way
BACK INSIDE HER CAR

Her mind is elsewhere as she gets back behind the wheel and
closes the door with a meaty THUD She backs out of the

Sisters of Mercy parking lot then heads down the tree-lined
steeply graded Mountain Ave The road is slick fog thick

Were TIGHT on Rosanna’s ear Oscar’s POV close to her

OSCAR (0OS)
Fraud

Startled Rosanna misses the bend in the road As her tires
slide into a ditch she hits the breaks but --

Bags deploy Her harness holds her in but feels the THUD of
an invisible Oscar slamming into the back of her seat

Dazed she glances back and sees Oscar in the rear-view
mirror coming out of the Fade She screams

Before she can get out Oscar wraps his arm around her neck
in a perfect choke hold He holds his face tight to hers

OSCAR (CONTD)
Fraud of a mother

ROSANNA
It’s you

She tries to get a look at him but can’t see his face

ROSANNA (CONTD)
My boy

OSCAR
The son you threw away

ROSANNA
No

Years of pain and rejection in his voice as he says

OSCAR
Why Why didnt you want me

ROSANNA
I wanted you so bad

OSCAR
Liar
He tightens his grip choking her She can barely speak

ROSANNA
Let me explain

Oscar loosens his grip enabling her to speak We notice a
can of LACQUER THINNER bulges from inside his coat pocket

ROSANNA (CONTD)
My husband Told me you died

OSCAR
I saw your signature

ROSANNA
He forged the papers I swear
I never wouldve given you up

OSCAR
You didn’t know I was in Monument
all this time -- so close to you
ROSANNA
I didn’t
OSCAR

Mothers know
He holds the blade of Toubert’s knife against her cheek

OSCAR (CONTD)
Tell me For once in my life -- I
want the truth

Tears run down Rosanna’s face As if in a twisted
confessional she finally gets to unburden herself

ROSANNA
I felt like a piece of me was
missing But I-I couldn’t imagine

OSCAR
So you knew You knew something

Rosanna despises herself for this but she nods “yes”

OSCAR (CONTD)
And did nothing

ROSANNA
I was afraid

OSCAR
Of what
ROSANNA
The truth Jesus God
OSCAR
He’s not here
ROSANNA
He’s everywhere
OSCAR
No Here it’s just you and me
ROSANNA
We can start over
OSCAR
It’s too late
ROSANNA
No Please Oscar
OSCAR
Don’t You don’t know me
ROSANNA
I love you
OSCAR

Don’t lie to me

ROSANNA
I’m not You’re part of me

OSCAR
I’m part of nothing Just a freak
YOU made me YOU did this to me

ROSANNA
Forgive me

OSCAR
I can’t

ROSANNA
I love you

OSCAR
I hate you

Suddenly he stabs at her She flinches the blade gets
caught in the airbag She opens her door and bursts outside
EXT ROSANNA’S MERCEDES MOUNTAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Oscars door starts opening but a terrified Rosanna kicks
the door shut -- jamming him back into the car

Frightened she looks up the hill but cant see far in the
fog But she knows the convent is nearby We FOLLOW her as
she takes off running heading uphill

She hears Oscar’s feet on leaves and snapping branches behind
her but when she looks over her shoulder she cant see him

Oscars Fade POV follows her through the trees and fog
INT MEREDITH’S SAAB DRIVING - EARLY EVENING

Merediths car climbs Mountain Road

MEREDITH

Paul please let me help you
PAUL

You can’t
MEREDITH

Don’t cut me out

PAUL
I havent told you everything

MEREDITH
Then tell me

PAUL
I dont want you to know You’d
feel different about me

MEREDITH
How

PAUL
Afraid

MEREDITH

I dont believe that

PAUL
Merry Im just trying to live my
life and not hurt anyone else
(then)
Especially someone I love

MEREDITH
Paul I --
-- She stops noticing UP AHEAD the crashed Mercedes

MEREDITH (CONTD)
Oh my god

She quickly slows and pulls off the road

EXT MOUNTAIN ROAD - CONTINUOUS

Paul and Meredith get out and look for survivors No ones
here and they cannot see far in the fog Paul takes out his

phone but gets NO SERVICE up here

PAUL
Go back down and call for help

She hates to separate from him but theres no other choice
She gets back in her car turns around and drives off

As he runs up the steep hillside Paul yells

PAUL (CONTD)
Rosanna

EXT SISTERS OF MERCY - EARLY EVENING

Rosanna reaches the top of the hill and sees Sisters of Mercy
through the fog She heads for the nearest structure

The CHAPEL next to the convent
INT CHAPEL SISTERS OF MERCY - SAME
Rosanna makes it inside and shuts the door hyperventilating

ROSANNA
---h-help Help

But no one responds She finds the light switch and turns it
on -- the chapel is empty She hears the door start to open
She pushes it closed and slides the bolt locking it

Catching her breath she kneels before the Virgin Mary

ROSANNA (CONTD)
Imso sorry

Rosanna sees that can of lacquer thinner BURST THROUGH a
stained glass window a flaming rag in its mouth The
Molotov cocktail spreads accelerant across the chapel floor

EXT WOODS TOP OF THE HILL - SAME

Paul emerges from the woods He can see Sisters of Mercy
convent and the CHAPEL from here He sees smoke coming out
its one broken stained glass window We FOLLOW him to

FRONT OF CHAPEL
Paul finds the door locked Hears the crunching of leaves

Out of the corner of his eye he sees the fog swirl
Instinctively Paul raises his arms to defend himself --

SLICE -- a gash opens up on the sleeve of his coat

PAUL
Oscar STOP

Silence Just breathing

PAUL (CONTD)
This has to end

OSCAR (O0S - IN THE FADE)
That’s what I’m doing

PAUL
Not that way Rosanna’s husband
was a bad man but she doesn’t
deserve the same end

OSCAR (0S - IN THE FADE)
You’re all liars and frauds

Paul hears Oscar’s footsteps recede as he runs around the
side of the chapel Cursing under his breath Paul follows

INT CHAPEL SISTERS OF MERCY - SAME

On FIRE Rosanna unbolts the door but cant open it --
Oscars got something wedged under the door

CRASH Rosanna turns to see one of the windows burst open
but from what She hears footsteps running towards her

Suddenly she’s bowled over feeling Oscar’s hands around her
throat as he materializes out of the Fade She gets her

first good look at her boy who would be handsome if not for
the grotesquely crooked nose -- an artifact of many beatings

OSCAR
I wouldve been a good son
On her back now she tries to pry his hands off but he’s got
the strength of youth raging with testosterone and anguish

OSCAR (CONTD)
I wouldve loved you so much

Her face turns red from lack of oxygen She passes out
OSCAR (CONTD)

Hell is here Mother and youre
gonna burn for what you did to me

Suddenly PAUL drives his shoulder into Oscar -- sending him
flying against the wall -- Oscar goes back into the Fade
PAUL
Shit

Paul can’t see Oscar but he sees the thick smoke swirl as he
runs toward the broken window at the back of the chapel

Paul turns his attention to Rosanna As he shakes her she
slowly comes to oxygen once again reaching her brain She
coughs from the smoke Paul pulls her to her feet

PAUL (CONTD)
Let’s get you out of here

Tears stream down Rosanna’s face

ROSANNA
--All my fault

PAUL
No Its bigger than you and me

He starts toward the rear of the chapel to the broken
window but a flaming BEAM falls and cuts them off

Paul turns toward the front door He kicks it The door
inches open despite the wedge He keeps kicking

INT MEREDITH’S SAAB DRIVING

Meredith pulls up to Sisters of Mercy She stops her car
gets out and runs toward the burning chapel She sees
ROSANNA squeeze through the barely opened front door
CLOSER - THE CHAPEL

Suddenly Rosannas yanked from Paul’s grasp by an unseen
Oscar Meredith witnesses the impossible
Bit by bit Rosanna starts to disappear from sight within
seconds like any other object in the hands of a fader

Paul squeezes through the door but now that he’s outside he
can’t see Rosanna He makes eye contact with Meredith

PAUL
Where did she go

MEREDITH
She faded

Desperate Paul makes a difficult decision He closes his
eyes and screams Meredith sees him go into the Fade

PAULS Fade POV he can see the faded Oscar and Rosanna as
if they were sketches Their backs are to Paul as Oscar
clutches his mother keeping her in the fade with him

We cut back and forth from Pauls and Oscars Fade POV -- and
Merediths perspective seeing nothing but hearing it all

PAUL (IN THE FADE)
Let her go Oscar

Paul’s Fade POV -- Oscar releases Rosanna As she falls to
the ground Paul sees that her throat is already CUT

PAUL (CONTD)
No

Meredith sees Rosanna come out of the Fade bleeding

MEREDITH
Oh my god

Oscar’s Fade POV -- he sees that Paul too is in the Fade

OSCAR (IN THE FADE)
You are like me

Meredith goes over to Rosanna putting her hand over the
wound trying to staunch the bleeding

PAUL (IN THE FADE)
What have you done

Realizing that he’s not alone in this world Oscar’s demeanor
changes He looks up at Paul now realizing his mistake

OSCAR (IN THE FADE)
I’m sorry I --
He sees Paul’s fist come flying at his face -- WHAM
The lanky boy sails off his feet onto the ground

MEREDITH
Paul Where are you PAUL

Consumed by rage Paul stands over Oscar

PAUL (IN THE FADE)
I wanted to help you

OSCAR (IN THE FADE)
Wanted

PAUL (IN THE FADE)
But thisthis cycle has to end

Oscar sees Paul eyeing the knife on the ground between them

OSCAR (IN THE FADE)
There’s no hope for me

PAUL (IN THE FADE)
For either of us

Meredith hears this but can’t see them

MEREDITH
Paul don’t say that

Oscar materializes out of the fade looking at her sadly

OSCAR
We’re damned

MEREDITH
He isn’t

OSCAR

You have no idea
Oscar speaks to Paul whom he now cannot see

OSCAR (CONTD)
Go ahead Paul End it

MEREDITH
No Paul whatever you’re feeling
now resist it You can do it

Paul’s POV standing over a vulnerable Oscar Wavering

Oscar slowly picks up the knife holding it out for him
OSCAR
You know what to do

Paul’s POV backs away fighting the temptation

OSCAR (CONTD)
Do it

A police siren wails announcing Jules’ cruiser as it speeds
up Mountain Road and pulls into the convent parking lot

Oscar seizes the opportunity and lunges toward Meredith with
the knife poised to strike

As the blade descends toward Meredith’s back Oscars body is
knocked off its trajectory As he hits on the ground --

Paul comes out of the Fade The cluster of male bodies rolls
over once then twice As Paul extricates himself Meredith
gasps -- seeing Paul’s chest covered in blood

But Paul rises to his knees seemingly unhurt He looks down
at Oscar lying on his side unmoving Paul carefully rolls
the limp boy over to reveal first his lifeless eyes Then he

sees why -- Toubert’s knife plunged deep into Oscar’s chest
PAUL
No Please God no

He feels in vain for a pulse Paul covers his own face
twisted with horror and regret hands leaving bloody smears

A stunned Meredith looks over at Paul only now able to
fathom the war raging inside of him all this time

Jules emerges from his cruiser its light-bar pulsating the
fog red and blue He sees his sister on the ground Meredith’s
hands wrapped around her bleeding neck He approaches

JULES
Rosy ROSY

The sky RUMBLES A heavy RAIN starts coming down on them

Paul looks down at the boy he failed to save For once
Oscar looks innocent having found peace in his death

Paul looks up at the sky for an answer that does not come
but slowly the rain washes the smears of blood from his face

EXT MONUMENT CEMETERY - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

We TILT DOWN from a raining sky to the face of YOUNG PAUL

He struggles to push his DAD’s wheelchair (Lou’s head is
bandaged) through uneven terrain of the Monument Cemetery
accompanied by Young Yvette They look dressed for church

They approach a cluster of MOURNERS standing around a freshly
dug grave The Young Father Gastineau presides

YOUNG FATHER GASTINEAU
We are gathered here to say
farewell to Omer LaBatt and commit
him into the hands of God

The Moreauxs are still out of earshot when Yvette says

YOUNG YVETTE
I don’t understand why we’re here

LOU
I knew him a long time
He was a good man

YOUNG YVETTE
After what he did to you
how can you say that

LOU
Who knows what I would do if I
couldn’t feed the two of you

As they reach the grave Young Paul sees Omer’s traumatized
WIDOW and their 15 year-old SON whose tears mix with rain

YOUNG FATHER GASTINEAU
In the name of the Father the Son
and the Holy Spirit

For a moment OMER’S BOY looks right at Young Paul’s guilt-
stricken face as if somehow he knew even if he doesn’t

THWACK-THWACK-THWACK We hear the IBM selectric OVER --
THE TYPE BALL

Of Pauls electric typewriter banging out the words

At that moment I vowed -- never to fade again

INT PAUL’S APARTMENT MANHATTAN - NIGHT (PRESENT)

Paul pulls the paper out of the old typewriter and looks at

the final line He includes it with the rest of his
Manuscript of his childhood events he’s entitled “FADE”

Next to his typewriter we see that photograph of his sister
Yvette and her three kids And next to that another
picture Jules with his sister Rosanna her neck bandaged
On the cover page Paul scribbles For you and you only
Paul takes the manuscript with him and leaves the room

INT PAUL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He enters his bedroom where Meredith sleeps He lays the
Manuscript on the night stand where that photo of her sat

Paul gets into bed next to her and turns out the light
CREDITS start Then we CUT BACK TO

THAT PHOTO OF YVETTE AND HER KIDS

Paul’s niece Laura glows then fades out of the picture
PAUL’S EYES

Bolt open as he WAKES from his portentous dream Lying next
to Meredith he feels the Fade take over his body -- but this
time he doesn’t fight it As he disappears from sight we

FADE OUT

END
