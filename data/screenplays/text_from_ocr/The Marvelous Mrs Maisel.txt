Revised Writers Draft
October 1 2015
THE SCREEN IS BLACK

The sound of a large room of people rustling in their seats
A little clinking of forks on china

MIDGE (0S)
Who gives a toast at her own
wedding

FADE IN

INT PLAZA HOTEL BALLROOM
We come up on the beaming face of MIRIAM “MIDGE” MAISEL
20s adorable her eyes sparkle with satisfaction Framed
by a cloud of tulle her face is full of perk spunk and
complete ignorance that bad things could ever happen
Because today she has triumphed Today is her wedding day

MIDGE
I mean who does that Who stands
in the middle of a ballroom after
drinking three glasses of champagne
on a completely empty stomach and
I mean completely empty because
fitting into this dress required no
solid food for three straight
weeks Who does that I do

WE CUT WIDE

The room breaks into applause The packed ballroom is
stuffed with guests dressed to the nines Flowers candles
and glittery snowflakes suspended from the ceiling like it’s
a magical fairyland Midge stands in the middle of this
fairyland holding a microphone wearing a perfect satin dress
with cap sleeves and crinolines crinolines crinolines

MIDGE (CONTD)

This day is perfect It’s like a
dream Or a nightmare if you’re my
father

(in an annoyed Jewish

father voice)

How much for flowers Who eats
mushroom caps How much if we cook
the meat ourselves Does the
caterer have any idea what the Jews
just went through a few years ago

ANGLE ON THE WEDDING TABLE

ABE WEISSMAN fifties tall lanky with long elegant pianist
fingers and a vague look of disappointment constantly on his
face sits next to his wife ROSE WEISSMAN forties petite

ANGLE ON MIDGE

MIDGE
But this day has been long in the
planning Anyone who knows me
knows - I plan I think long-game
At six I decided Russian
literature would be my major At
twelve I found my signature
haircut At 13 I announced I was
going to Bryn Mawr University

was a charmed one

FLASHBACK
INT BRYN MAWR DINING ROOM
Girls pour in nervously looking for their place cards at the
tables FRESHMAN MIDGE walks in and takes in the room

MIDGE (VO)
First of all my roommate Petra
was friendly and fat which was
perfect I’1ll have someone to eat
with but she won’t steal my
boyfriend

A CHUBBY SWEET FACED GIRL joins Miriam’s side

PETRA
Smells so good

The two girls make their way over to a table and search for
their name cards They sit and Petra grabs the bread basket

MIDGE (VO)
The campus was old and elegant
With ivy covered buildings stained
glass windows and

Midge glances down at the table and sees a butter pat ona
tiny butter china dish with the initials “BM” carved
elaborately in the center
MIRIAM
(in awe)
Monogrammed butter pats

PETRA
What
(sees)
Ooh

Petra stabs the butter pat and smears it on her roll

BACK TO WEDDING

MIDGE
And we got them every single day
At every single meal This was a
magical place A place where
butter was beautiful and I would
learn everything Where I would
solve the mysteries of the universe
and meet brilliant women kindred
spirits who would explore these
brave new worlds with me

MIDGE AT THE WEDDING

MIDGE
I have been very lucky I have
wonderful parents I have lived a
comfortable life And though I
knew that love would be great I
had no idea it would be anything
that could justify what I paid for
this dress

ANGLE ON THE WEDDING TABLE

ABE
What I paid for that dress

ANGLE ON MIDGE

MIDGE
And because it’s better than
anything I could’ve imagined I
thought I should get up here and
tell all of you that I love this
man and yes there is shrimp in
the eggrolls

A loud roar of laughter and outrage fill the room

ROSE
(exasperated)
Miriam
(running off calling)
Rabbi Wait Don’t leave

The room is chaos Abe is arguing with the ancient man

ABE
(to irate old man)
You show me in the Bible where God
says you can’t have shrimp
IRATE OLD MAN

INT MIDGE’S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Midge stands in the middle of the room wearing a black
leotard and black tights measuring her ankles with a tape-
measure Her friend IMOGENE is sprawled out on the couch a
pitcher of daiquiri’s and a couple of glasses sit on the
coffee table The television is on Imogene is a round-
faced slightly dizzy lady mid-twenties who is probably
never going to lose that last bit of baby weight She has a
pen and a thick black leather binder on her lap

IMOGENE
So she’s going on and on about
this miracle treatment she had done
in Mexico It involved goat’s milk
and avocados

MIDGE
Right ankle 6 Left ankle 6

IMOGENE

They smear it on your face wrap a
hot towel around your head and put

IMOGENE
(writes in binder)

there for four hours Then

God you’re so tiny How long have
you been measuring yourself like

MIDGE
Everyday for ten years

IMOGENE
Even when you were pregnant
(flipping through)
God there’s not enough daiquiri’s
in the world

The door opens Joel rushes in

at the television

MIDGE
You’re not going to believe this
Bob Newhart is doing your act

JOEL
What

MIDGE
Bob Newhart He’s on Ed Sullivan
doing your act He must’ve come to
the club one night and seen you
perform

Joel goes to a cupboard and starts looking for something

MIDGE (CONTD)

And now he’s on television doing it
just like you do Well it’s a
little different because he does it
faster which is better actually
but that’s beside the point

Joel pulls out a bowl and dumps a container of rice into it

MIDGE (CONT’D)
I’m mad Aren’t you mad
JOEL
(starts opening all the
take out containers)
Midge relax

MIDGE
You’re not mad

JOEL
(finds a platter)
It’s fine everybody does it

MIDGE
Everybody steals his act

JOEL
(puts the food on platter)
Yes No Not steals Borrows
It’s no big deal

Beat

MIDGE
It’s not When I found out June
Friedman used my meatloaf recipe I
almost stabbed her in the eye with
a fork

JOEL

Everybody in comedy steals --
MIDGE

Borrows --
JOEL

Borrows everybody else’s jokes
Especially at the beginning Bob
Newhart probably used Henny
Youngman’s stuff when he started
That’s how it’s done

MIDGE

Oh Well if that’s how it’s done
JOEL

It is
MIDGE

I thought you’d written it That
act I feel a little silly now

JOEL
Well I did put my spin on it

MIDGE
Yes You slowed it down

JOEL
And my inflection is different

MIDGE
Right Well I’m new to this
SO

JOEL
You’1ll learn

MIDGE
Yeah I guess so

Joel gathers up the food and forks and knives

JOEL
You want a drink

He heads out

MIDGE

watching me bomb

MIDGE
It was one stupid night

JOEL
And I’m up there dying and I’m
thinking about last week We’re in
Temple and the Rabbi tells that
stupid Sodom and Gomorrah joke and
suddenly the whole synagogue goes
nuts

MIDGE
So

JOEL
He got more laughs in five minutes

Polish restaurant that has
“Kielbasa” nights

JOEL
I can’t believe this

MIDGE
I never knew you were serious about
it

JOEL
Of course I was serious Miriam
What the hell ever made you think I
wasn’t serious

MIDGE
Well for starters you were doing
someone else’s act

MIDGE
If you really wanted to be a
comedian you shouldve written a
joke

JOEL

I tried with the “Ted” thing
MIDGE

JOEL

And it bombed
MIDGE

Because you killed it

The waitress pulls herself off the stool and begrudgingly
ambles off Midge sits exhausted The young fragile sad
poet finishes and the room applauds half-heartedly Midge
takes the last swig from her bottle It’s empty She sighs
and puts it on the bar The MC takes the stage again

MC

fixed on the stage slowly gets up and steps up on it almost
as if in a trance She walks around taking it in She
stops facing away from the audience

MIDGE
(talking to herself)

partially blinded

MIDGE
Me either sister Me either

ANGLE ON BAR

Susie ambles in from the back She freezes stunned to see
Midge onstage

ANGLE ON MIDGE

MIDGE (CONTD)

So many questions spinning in my
head Why did he leave Why
wasn’t I enough Why didn’t they
put the stage over there on that
wall instead of here by the
bathroom so you wouldn’t have to
listen to every giant bowel
movement that takes place in there

(to horrified audience)
Oh yeah Clear as a bell

ANGLE ON SUSIE
She’s fascinated now
ANGLE ON MIDGE
MIDGE (CONTD)
I’m sorry I’m a little drunk and
my brain is spinning Everything I
had counted on is gone
A guy comes out of the bathroom
MIDGE (CONTD)
(to the guy)

You feeling better now

BATHROOM GUY
(confused)
The audience laughs They think it’s a performance now

MIDGE
(continues pacing)
So my life completely fell apart
today Did I mention that my
husband left me
(same guy “whoos”)
Okay fine But did I tell you he
left me for his secretary She’s
21 and dumb as a bag of salt And
I’m not naive I know men like
stupid girls
(suddenly to guy with the
blonde in the front row)
Right

GUY WITH BLONDE
(caught)
Uhhh

MIDGE

(continues on)

But I thought Joel wanted more
than stupid I thought he wanted
spontaneity And wit I thought
he wanted to be challenged

(to the Blonde)

You know what I mean

WOMAN
Uhhh

MIDGE
(indicating Blonde and the
guy with her)

You two will be together forever
And Ill tell you this much I was
a great wife I was fun

(a little more heightened)
I planned theme nights I dressed
in costumes I gave him kids A
boy and a girl and yes our little
girl is looking more and more like
Winston Churchill every day you
know with that big old Yalta-head
But that’s not a reason to leave
right

A guy crosses the stage and heads to the bathroom
MIDGE (CONTD)
(to the guy)
Really After what I just said
about the bathroom

The audience laughs The guy turns and sits back down

MIDGE (CONTD)
(back to her monologue)
I loved him

The women in the audience are with her

MIDGE (CONTD)
And I showed him I loved him

The men of the audience are with her

MIDGE (CONTD)
All that shit they say about Jewish
girls in the bedroom Not true
There’s French whores standing
around the Marais district saying
“did you hear what Midge did to
Joel’s balls the other night”

More HOOTS More LAUGHS

MIDGE (CONTD)

I can’t do accents Sorry Joel
did accents Joel did great
accents Oh God

(tearing up)
