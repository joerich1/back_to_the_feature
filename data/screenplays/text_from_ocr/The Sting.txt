THE STING
FADE IN

A white on black TITLE appears in the lower left hand corner
of the screen

AUGUST 1936

FADE OUT
FADE IN
EXT A SLUM AREA OF JOLIET - DAY

Its a bleak windy morning the kind that clears the
streets of all but the winos (who carry their own heaters)
and the point-men for juvenile gangs We pick up a solitary
figure Joe Mottola coming down the street and entering
what appears to be an abandoned tenement He pauses a
second to dust his white-winged alligator shoes on the back
of his pants leg Sharply dressed and surrounded by the
aura of one who is making money for the first time and
broadcasting it on all bands he seems an incongruity in
this part of town

We follow him up a flight of rickety stairs to a second
floor flat He knocks on the door is admitted by a cautious
doorman

INT NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

Suddenly we are plunged into a room of chattering clamoring
people This is a spot for the numbers racket a place
immune from legal interference where any sucker can bet on
a number between 1 and 1000 in the hope of getting the 600

to 1 payoff that goes to those few who guess right The
bettors are queued up in several lines before a long table
where they place their bets and are given receipts in return
Others wait at a cashiers window to pick up previous
earnings or to ask for credit

Mottola moves through the crowd to a back room where betting
slips are being sorted and money counted under the watchful
and somewhat impatient gaze of a Supervisor an older man
named Mr Granger The Yankee-White Sox game is heard on
the radio in the background

Mottola noticing that his entrance has aroused little
interest saunters over to the Phone Girl and gives her a
little pinch on the cheek The girl slaps his hand away
obviously having been through this before

PHONE GIRL
Beat it Mottola

Granger glances up and exchanges a token nod with Mottola
who plops down in a folding chair next to the radio The
phone rings

PHONE GIRL
8720Yes hold on a second
(calling over to the Supervisor)
Mr Granger Chicago on the line

Granger is a little apprehensive about talking to Chicago
but takes the phone anyway
GRANGER
Yeh

CUT TO
INT A WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - CHICAGO - DAY

A flabby bald man named Combs is on the other end of the
line Visible beyond the door and interior window of his
office is a large room cluttered with tables typewriters
clerks and adding machines This room is the clearinghouse
for all the transaction of the numbers game All the
betting slips and income from the spots are brought in here
and processed

COMBS
Granger this is Combs Why
havent we heard from ya Everybody
else is in

GRANGER
We had a few problems with the Law
this morning The Mayor promised
the Jaycees to get tough on the
rackets again so he shut everybody
down for a couple hours to make it
look good Nothing serious it
just put us a little behind for the
day

COMBS
You been making your payoffs

GRANGER
Hell yes He does this every year
Theres nothing to worry about

COMBS

COMBS

GRANGER

Chicago south side How do ya

of paper on his desk)

Granger

INT NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

Granger burns inside One of the girls whos been sorting
and counting hands him a slip of paper

GRANGER

COMBS

Combs hangs up smiling to himself proud of the way he gave
the needle to Granger

INT NUMBERS SPOT - DAY

Granger storming over to a safe and jerking open the door

GRANGER
(snapping)
Mottola

Mottola hustles out of his chair

GRANGER

(handing him a bundle

of bills)
Take this up to the city on the
415 Theyll be waitin for it at
the clearing house And dont stop
for no drinks You can get a cab
down the street

Mottola takes the money and slips it into his inside coat
pocket with all the dramatic flair of the true flunky No
one would ever guess that he was just an overdressed
messenger boy

EXT OF THE TENEMENT AGAIN

Mottola emerges from a side entrance into a narrow alley

He walks briskly down to the end and turns left into a large
alleyway this one connecting two streets The alley is
deserted save for one scruffy slovenly dressed young
stranger coming toward him from the opposite direction The
man carries a battered suitcase and seems to be in a hurry

Suddenly Mottola hears shouting coming from somewhere
behind him He turns around to see a small weathered
looking thief come racing around the corner and down the
alley toward him frantically pursued by a gray-haired black
man Limping noticeably the black man manages a few cries
for help and then stumbles and falls The stranger yells at
Mottola to cover his side of the alley and then readies
himself for the arrival of the thief Mottola just stands
there not the least interested in the exercise of justice
Just as the thief is about to run on by the stranger throws
his suitcase at the little mans legs sending him sprawling
and separating him from the wallet hes been carrying in his
left hand

The stranger makes a dash for the wallet and kicks it back
to where Mottola is standing Almost by reflex Mottola
picks it up The thief scrambles to his feet and starts
back toward his new-found enemy brandishing a knife Both
the stranger and Mottola brace themselves for an attack
The thief realizing that there are two people to fight
begins to think better of it He is not a young man nor
particularly strong

THIEF
(shaking his fist at
the stranger)
You fuckin nigger-lover Ill get
you for this someday sucker egg

Mottola and the stranger exchange glances of relief as the
thief flees out onto the street and disappears

The black man meanwhile has struggled to his feet and is
staggering toward them He collapses against the alley wall
after a few steps The stranger rushes over to him followed
somewhat absently by Mottola

BLACK MAN
The wallet You gotta go after him
Hes got all the money

STRANGER
Dont worry we got the wallet
What happened He get ya with the
knife

The stranger opens the Black Mans coat to reveal a bloody
wound at the top of his leg

BLACK MAN
(trying to move)
Give it to me Please I gotta

know its all there

STRANGER
You just sit tight old man Were
gonna have to get you to a doctor
(starting to leave)
Ill call a cop

BLACK MAN
No no cops

Mottola has given him his wallet which the black man now
opens disclosing a fat bundle of bills tied by a rubber
band Mottola and the stranger are amazed by the amount of
money

STRANGER
(a little uneasy)
You wanted by the law or somethin

BLACK MAN
Naw its okay

STRANGER
Youre crazy carryin that kinda
money in this neighborhood No
wonder you got hit

BLACK MAN
(trying to get to his feet)
Thanks Im obliged to ya but I

under him)

STRANGER
You aint goin nowhere on that leg

BLACK MAN

MOTTOLA
(taking the bundle of
bills from the black
man plus the 100 bill)
All right Ill make your drop for

Mottola puts the bills in his inside coat pocket
to the numbers money The stranger who has now finished
bandaging watches him do it

STRANGER
If that punk and his pals decide to
search ya youll never fool em
carryin it there

BLACK MAN
(suddenly afraid again)
What do we do

STRANGER
You got a bag or somethin

BLACK MAN

STRANGER
How bout a handkerchief

BLACK MAN

The stranger goes into the right coat pocket and pulls out a
wrinkled handkerchief

STRANGER
Let me have the money

Mottola takes out the Black Mans five grand and hands it to

the Stranger

He puts it in the handkerchief

STRANGER
You better stick that other in here
too if you wanta keep it

BLACK MAN
(pleading)
Just hurry will ya

Mottola pulls out the numbers money and puts it in the
handkerchief too The stranger ties it all up

STRANGER
(demonstrating by
slipping the bundle
down into crotch)
All right Carry it down in your
pants here
(pulling it back out
and tucking it in
Mottolas pants)
Aint no hard guy in the world
gonna frisk ya there

MOTTOLA
Thanks
(to the black man)
So long partner Dont worry
everythings gonna be all right

The Black Man nods gratefully but theres still a trace of
worry on his face Mottola trots off down the alley and out
onto the street glancing around cautiously for signs of
trouble He walks hurriedly down the sidewalk toward the
cab stand in the distance Suddenly the little man with the
knife appears out of a doorway about 15 yards behind him
Mottola notices him and quickens his pace finally breaking
into a dead run

We follow him as he dashes headlong down the street opening
a big lead on the guy with the knife He reaches the taxi
zone He hops in a cab and slams the door

INT TAXI - DAY

He jumps in closes the door and breathes a sigh of relief

CABBIE
Where to

MOTTOLA
Which way is Mason

CABBIE
About 20 blocks south

MOTTOLA
Okay go north The Joliet

Station -- Fast

Mottola settles back in his seat and starts to laugh

CABBIE
Whats so funny

MOTTOLA
I just made the worlds easiest
five grand

He takes the bundle out from inside his pants in order to
gaze upon his new-found fortune He unties the handkerchief
Its full of toilet paper Mottola looks like hes just
been shot

CUT TO
EXT ALLEY - DAY - THE STRANGER AND BLACK MAN

hightailing it down the street two newly solvent con
artists on the lam Its hard to run theyre laughing so
hard The stranger chucks his suitcase in a trash can and
pulls the real handkerchief out of his pants

BLACK MAN
Jesus what a bundle Did you know
he was that loaded

STRANGER
Hell no I just cut into him I
woulda settled for pawning one of
them shoes
As they split off music begins and we go into a

TITLES SEQUENCE

Done to a driving Chicago blues the sequence is designed to
establish somewhat the milieu of the stranger known to
friends and enemies alike as Hooker We see the following
EXT PAWNSHOP - LOOKING INSIDE - DAY

Hooker is getting a radio and well-worn suit out of hook
Its like seeing old friends again All pantomime

INT HOOKERS ROOM - DAY

A shabby little place he rents above a cigar store We pick
him up in a jerry-built outdoor shower which hes rigged up
on the fire escape The rinse water drips down through the
landing into the grimy alley below

HOOKER
(singing)
‘With plenty of money and you-oo-
00
Oh baby what I wouldnt do-oo-
oo

ON THE STREET AGAIN

jauntily carrying a magnum of champagne and some flowers
obviously on his way to see someone special

IN A BURLESQUE HOUSE

Hooker stands in the wings holding the flowers and champagne
watching his date for the evening a 63 stripper named
Crystal do her routine

Crystal finishes up and comes off the stage

CRYSTAL
(tired)
Hi Hooker you gettin married or
somethin

HOOKER
Come into a little dough You
wanna get outa here tonight

CRYSTAL
Cant I got a 10 oclock show I
need the five bucks

HOOKER
Ill spend fifty on ya

Crystal looks at him a second and starts to giggle Were
pretty sure shes gonna get outa here tonight

COMING INTO A POOR MANS GAMBLING JOINT

Little more than a reconverted brick basement the place
contains three shoddy homemade roulette tables Hooker
accompanied now by Crystal nods a greeting to the doorman
and proceeds to a table where there are already several
other people laying their bets for the next spin Hooker
knows the wheel man an old-timer named Jimmy
JIMMY
(glad to see him)
Hooker

HOOKER
How ya doin Jimmy

JIMMY
(collecting bets and
paying off the winners)
Aint seen you in months boy
Thought maybe you took a fall

HOOKER
Naw just a little hard times
thats all Its all over now
JIMMY

You gonna have a go here

(pointing to the

betting board)
How bout a ten spot on the line
here The 4-9 been lookin good
today Lotsa action on 28th Street
down there too Pay ya 10-1

As Jimmy finishes his spiel he starts the wheel spinning
and drops in the ball Betting is allowed to continue until
the ball drops from the outer ring into the center

HOOKER
(taking out his wallet)
Three grand on the black

Jimmy is stunned The others at the table used to dollar
bets look at Hooker like hes some kind of foreign dignitary

JIMMY
(worried)
You sure you wanna start off that
big Bet like that could put a
real dent in us

HOOKER
I feel lucky tonight

JIMMY
Aw come on Hooker why dont you
just
HOOKER
Three grand on the black Jimmy

Jimmy wants to argue some more but the ball is getting
ready to drop into the center We see Jimmy quickly press a
hidden lever under the table with his foot The ball falls
and settles into red 27 with a motion that is not quite
right The others at the table fail to notice but Hooker
is not fooled He stares venomously at Jimmy who knows
that Hooker is on to him

JIMMY

Sorry Hooker

(making an attempt at
levity in order to explain)
Good thing that ball came up red
Guy could get in trouble around
here losin a bet that big

Jimmy reaches for Hookers money Hooker stops him by
putting his hand on it

HOOKER
Spin it again

Jimmy doesnt know what the hell to do He gives Hooker a
little head motion to indicate a small window high up in one
of the walls Behind it we see a pair of eyes Suddenly
Hooker understands why Jimmy had to cheat him but it
doesnt change his demand

HOOKER
Spin it anyway Jimmy

Jimmy is beside himself If he doesnt spin again Hooker
may expose him If he does spin and loses his management
will fire him He pleads to Hooker with his eyes but its
no use Jimmy spins the wheel and reluctantly drops in the
ball This time there is no foot on the lever and it
settles into black 15 Hooker stares at the ball a second
and then looks up at his terrified friend

HOOKER
Dont worry pal I knew it was my
night

Hooker pushes the money over to Jimmy and walks out of the
room Hes lost 3000 but hes still working on a lucky
night

cut To
EXT GAMBLING JOINT
Hooker and Crystal out on the street

CRYSTAL
(irritated)
Thanks for the evening Hooker I
can still make the 10 oclock If
you wanna spend 50 bucks on me
again mail it

She walks off down the street

HOOKER
(going into his
pocket for more money)
Hey wait a minute
(he comes up with 30)
Aw the hell with ya

CUT TO
EXT THE WATERFRONT PROCESSING PLANT - LATE AFTERNOON

A late model Ford roars up and screeches to a stop in front
of the plant Out bursts a carefully-groomed tight-lipped
young man named Greer who hustles into the plant We
follow him through a maze of machinery to the service
elevator and up to the third floor where we find ourselves
in the clearinghouse room we saw earlier

INT PLANT - AFTERNOON - LATE

The working day is over now and everyone has gone except
for Combs who sits somberly in his office

GREER
They found Mottola He was drunk
in a dive in Joliet Never got on
the train
COMBS
(aggravated)

I dont wanta hear about his day
Greer What happened to the money

GREER
He lost it to a coupla con artists
on his way outa the spot

COMBS
How much
GREER
Twelve thousand

Combs sits in quiet thought for a second Finally

COMBS
All right Better get on the phone
to New York See what the big mick
wants to do about it
(pause)
I gotta pretty good idea though

CUT TO
INT AN EXCLUSIVE NEW YORK GAMBLING CLUB - LATE AFTERNOON

An agitated young man Floyd weaves his way through the
craps and roulette tables and hustles up a staircase to a
second floor room with a drawing of a snarling tiger on the
door Below the tiger the word FARO appears There is a
large man of thuggish demeanor guarding the door but
Floyd gives him a small hand signal and walks right by him

CUT TO
INSIDE THE FARO ROOM

In the center is a beautifully-carved wooden table on which
sit a faro board and a dealing box tended by a stone-faced
Dealer who calls the progress of the game in a continuous
abacus-like device that keeps track of the cards which have
already been played On the opposite side of the table
completely absorbed in the rhythmic appearance of the cards
from the dealing box sits Doyle Lonnegan Although is
clothes and accessories are those of a wealthy man there is
a coarseness to both his movement and speech which bespeak
lower class origins for which he now has nothing but
contempt

Floyd enters the room and approaches him cautiously trying
hard to make as little noise as possible

FLOYD
Doyle can I see you a minute

LONNEGAN
(not looking up from
the table)

Im busy Floyd

FLOYD
Its important We had a little
trouble in Chicago today One of
our runners got hit for 12 grand

LONNEGAN
(calmly)
Which one
FLOYD
Mottola
LONNEGAN

You sure he didnt just pocket it

FLOYD
No we checked his story with a
tipster He was cleaned by two
grifters on 47th

LONNEGAN
They workin for anybody

FLOYD
I dont know Could be Were
runnin that down now

LONNEGAN

All right mark Mottola up a little
and put him ona bus Nothin

fancy just enough to keep him from
coming back Get some local people
to take care of the other two

(impassively)
We gotta discourage this kinda thing

CUT TO
INT AN OLD BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Hooker still in his suit but looking a little worse for
wear knocks on the door of one of the apartments A young
black woman Louise answers the door holding a baby

HOOKER
Howdy Louise

LOUISE
(admiring Hooker in
his suit)
Goddamn Johnny Hooker youre a
sharp hunky in them linens If you
wasnt so pale Ida sworn you had
class

Hooker steps inside and walks right into a big hug from an
older black woman Alva Alva has a hat on obviously just
about to go out Beyond her we see the Eirie kid and the
Black Man (known from here on as Luther Coleman) playing a
game of mah jong on the dining table with a man whose back
is to us An 11-year-old boy is listening to the radio

COLEMAN
Turn that down Leroy

ALVA
Oh Johnny Luther said you was
somethin to see today

HOOKER
Ill never be as good as that mark
Alva

ALVA

Well we gonna hear all about it

Leroy goes to get his jacket Louise is finished putting
the baby to bed

HOOKER
You goin to church now

ALVA
They been havin late bingo down
there Im gonna call on the Lord
for a little cash while hes still
payin off Luther you look in on
that child from time to time will
ya

Luther nods that he will Alva Leroy and Louise leave for

church as Hooker strolls over and tosses two packets on the

table Luther doesnt pick his up but the other man does

We now see that he is the thief in the opening sequence He
is called the Eirie kid and he is delighted at his share

EIRIE KID
Hey Luther told me he was carrying

a wad but I didnt figure this much

HOOKER
Which way did he do Eirie

EIRIE KID
Straight north He was gonna take
it all and run

HOOKER
(laughs)
The bastard He can blow his nose
all the way

They laugh again but Luther doesnt share their enthusiasm
He watches Hooker who becomes uncomfortable under his gaze

COLEMAN
Youre late Where you been

HOOKER
(flopping into a chair)
I had some appointments

COLEMAN
(not fooled)
How much did ya lose

HOOKER
(after a pause)
All of it

COLEMAN

HOOKER

HOOKER

EXT A DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

Its late at night now Hooker and Eirie wander along the
street together not really ready to go home but with no
other ideas either Hooker obviously preoccupied idly
strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it
burn out He does this several times

HOOKER
How do you like that Coleman huh
After three years

EIRIE KID
Aw come on it was the only thing
to do He knew he was holdin ya
back

HOOKER
We were partners If it werent

HOOKER
You aint gonna have nothin if you

HOOKER

EIRIE KID

EIRIE KID
You could buy yourself some things
Clothes or a nice car

HOOKER
I dont look any good in clothes
and I dont know how to drive
What else ya got to sell Eirie

EIRIE KID
Forget it

They walk on a few more feet when suddenly a police car
pulls up alongside them and two men jump out The first a
uniformed policeman grabs Eirie around the neck

Hooker makes a break for it but the second Figure a burly
detective named Snyder tackles him in the middle of the
street drags him back into the alley and plasters him up
against a brick wall The two have met before

HOOKER
Hi there Snyder Things a little
slow down at the Bunco Department
tonight eh Somebody lose the
dominoes

SNYDER
You scored blood money today
Hooker You need a friend

HOOKER
(knocking Snyders
hand away)
Aw find yourself a shoplifter to
roll

Snyder gives Hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it
with an elbow across the head Hooker flies into a row of
boxes and garbage cans

HOOKER
(getting up slowly)
You got the wrong guy pal I been
home with the flu all day
(rising to a fuller height)
You can stake out my toilet if you
want

Bang Snyder infuriated by Hookers irreverence slams him
to the ground again The policeman is no longer holding
Eirie but is almost daring him to make a move Eirie wants
to go to Hookers aid but he knows the policeman will beat
him to a pulp

SNYDER

(pulling Hooker out

of the heap and

smashing him against

the wall again)
Tll tell ya what you did smart
boy You tied into a loaded mark
on 47th across from Maxies You
and Coleman played the switch for
him and blew him off to a cab on
49th If he hadnt been a numbers
runner for Doyle Lonnegan it
woulda been perfect

HOOKER
(startled by the information)
Youre crazy Im not stupid
enough to play for rackets money

SNYDER
Not intentionally maybe but that
dont make no difference to Lonnegan
Hell swat you like any fly

HOOKER
Ill square it with the fixer

SNYDER
Nobody can buy you a prayer if I
put the finger on ya

Snyder lets go Hooker sinks back against the wall He
says nothing hes waiting for the price

SNYDER
I figure your end of the score was
at least 3 gees I want 2 no

HOOKER
(lying)
My end was only one

SNYDER
(not taking the fake)
Then youll have to come up with
another grand somewhere

Hooker is beat and he knows it

HOOKER
All right

He reaches into his coat pulls out a stack of bills and
counts out 2000 to Snyder Eirie looks on in amazement he
didnt think Hooker had it

SNYDER
(pocketing the money
and motioning his
partner to put his
gun away)
Youre a smart egg Hooker No use
dyin for 2 grand

Snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start
down the street Hooker and Eirie walk nonchalantly in the
other direction

EIRIE KID
I thought you blew all your money

HOOKER
I did That stuff I gave him was
counterfeit Theyll pinch him the
first place he tries to spend it

Snyder and his partner disappear around a corner Hooker
suddenly takes off like a shot

INT DRUGSTORE - NIGHT

He runs into a drugstore and goes to the phone booth
Theres already a woman in it Hooker rips open the door
and throws her out Hurriedly he begins to dial

EIRIE KID
(standing outside the booth)
What the hell you gonna do when
Snyder rushes his finger right to
Lonnegan Youre committin
suicide kid

HOOKER
(waiting for the ring)
Aw Christ it doesnt make no
difference now If Snyder knows
about it so does everybody else
He never gets anything firstDamn

EIRIE KID
Listen to me Hooker What ever

He bursts into Luthers room the door of which is already
open The room shows signs of a struggle a turned-over
chair a broken lamp but there is no Coleman Hooker goes
slowly to the window He looks down into the courtyard and
then suddenly sprints back out the door As we hear him
scrambling down the stairs the camera dollies to the window
and looks out

EXT COURTYARD - NIGHT

There on the concrete below face down is the body of
Luther Coleman Hooker races out to it and kneels down

HOOKER
(shaking the body)
Cmon Luther get up You gotta

windows and some people are starting to gather in the
courtyard

HOOKER (CONTD)

FADE OUT
FADE IN
INT THE TRAIN STATION - DAY

We open on Hooker sleeping in some remote corner of the
station covered with newspapers for warmth and barely
distinguishable from the clutter of junk surrounding him A
station security officer on his morning sweep wanders by
and delivers a terrific blow to the soles of Hookers feet
with a nightstick Hooker jolts awake with a cry of pain
as the officer diffidently moves on toward another sleeping
victim

Tired and sore from his night in the station Hooker
struggles to his feet and attempts to take stock of the
situation He tries to smooth the wrinkles out of his suit
but its futile A quick check of his wallet finds it as
empty as hed remembered it

CUT TO
THE STATION - GIFT SHOP - DAY

Hooker walks in and goes to the toy section He looks
through several small novelties till he finds what hes
looking for -- a little tin replica of a policemans badge
He looks around for station detectives and seeing none
slips the badge into his pocket

CUT TO
THE STATION - WASHROOM - DAY
Hooker rinses out his mouth towels off his face and slicks
his hair back with water Its a drop in the bucket but it
seems to revitalize him a little

CUT TO

STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

We see Hooker removing a sign from a door but the angle
prohibits us from reading it
INT STATION - DAY

He drops the sign in a waste can and walks out into the

crowded passenger lobby

After scanning the area carefully

for a minute he goes up to a conservative young business
man whos busy reading the schedule board

HOOKER

(flashing open his

wallet to reveal the

little tin badge and

then closing it again quickly)

Excuse me

and returning the wallet)

MAN

HOOKER
(with a little wave)

The man goes off down the hall more than grateful to be
given a break like this Hooker heads for the back We
follow the Man down the hall to the unmarked door He
strides on through to find himself face to face with a wall
of busily flushing urinals
CUT TO
EXT STATION - DAY - HOOKER
Boarding the 810 for Chicago

CUT TO
INT STATION - DAY

The Man wandering up and down the hall wondering how he
could have missed that room

EXT CHICAGO STREET - DAY

The street runs along side an elevated train track We pick
up Hooker coming down the street eating a hot dog he bought
with the money he just earned in the train station

He appears to be looking for an address referring every now
and then to the piece of paper Luther gave him the night
before Finally he stops in front of an old three-story
building which contains a carousel on the bottom 2 floors
and what appear to be apartments on the third floor He
peers inside the big sliding glass doors and seeing no sign
of life goes around to the side to look for a way in

A 35 year-old woman Billie appears in her bathrobe on the
second floor landing and descends the stairs to get the
morning paper Shes eating an apple Although she has
just gotten up and looks it she has the presence of one who
is probably quite striking at other hours The sight of
Hooker fazes her not at all

HOOKER
Excuse me Im looking for a guy
named Henry Gondorff You know him

BILLIE
(starting back up the stairs)
No

HOOKER
Luther Coleman sent me

Billie stops and comes back down the stairs Its the first
time shes stopped chewing

BILLIE
(checking him out)
You Hooker
HOOKER
Yeh

BILLIE
Why didnt you say so I thought
maybe you was a copper or somethin

She goes to a side door and unlocks it

BILLIE
Its the room in the back He
wasnt expecting you so soon though

Hookers not quite sure what that means but theres
something about Billie that makes him know that you dont ask

INT CAROUSEL - DAY

Hooker walks past the now motionless carousel to the room in
the back and knocks on the door No answer He gives the
door a little push and it swings open

INT GONDORFFS ROOM - DAY

The room inside if small and cluttered consisting of a bed
a sink and a bathroom all covered by a layer of books
dirty clothes and beer bottles Draped over a chair fully
dressed but completely passed out is the one and only Henry
Gondorff

HOOKER
(to himself)
The great Henry Gondorff

CUT TO
INT A SHOWER - DAY

Water blasting out of the fixture We see Gondorff still
fully clothed sitting in the bottom of the shower the
spray streaming off his face An imposing figure with deep
set eyes and full beard he just sits there stoically
looking like a soggy lumberjack Hooker sitting on the
floor between the toilet and the sink watches listlessly
Finally --

GONDORFF
Turn the goddamn thing off will ya

HOOKER
You sober
GONDORFF
I can talk cant I

Hooker makes no move to get up Gondorff struggles to his
knees turns off the water and slumps back against the wall
The two men just look past each other a second Down in the
bottom

GONDORFF
Glad to meet ya kid Youre a
real horses ass

HOOKER
Yeh Luther said you could teach me
something I already know how to
drink

Gondorff wipes his face with his hand His mood softens a
little

GONDORFF
(quietly)
Im sorry about Luther He was the
best street worker I ever saw

HOOKER
He had you down as a big-timer
What happened

GONDORFF
Aw I conned a Senator from Florida
on a stocks deal A real lop-ear
He thought he was gonna take over
General Electric Some Chantoozie
woke him up though and he put the
feds on me

HOOKER
You mean you blew it

GONDORFF
(pause)
Luther didnt tell me you had a big
mouth
HOOKER

He didnt tell me you was a fuck-
up either

(Gondorff looks at

him coldly)
You played the Big Con since then
GONDORFF
No I lammed it around for a while
while things cooled off Philly
Denver Baltimore nuthin towns

Hookers disappointment is obvious

GONDORFF
But dont kid yourself friend I
still know how

Hooker nods unconvinced

GONDORFF
(getting up from the
floor and emptying
the water out of his pockets)
You gonna stay for breakfast or do
you already know how to eat

HOOKER
(tired)
I picked something up on the way

GONDORFF
(sensing something)
Lonnegan after you too

HOOKER
I dont know Havent seen anybody

GONDORFF
You never do kid

We go to Hooker He hadnt thought of that

exchanges a friendly smile with McCoy and belts the ball
down the fairway
CUT TO
INT THE CAROUSEL AGAIN - DAY

Gondorff dried off now and in a new set of clothes is
pulling up the shades of the large facing windows of the
carousel building The morning light pours in illuminating
fully for the first time the ornate merry-go-round and its
massive oaken horses Hooker watches him go about his
business Billie calls down from the mezzanine which
surrounds the carousel

BILLIE
You feeling all right this morning
Henry

GONDORFF
Fine Billie

BILLIE

You mind opening the round a little
early today We got some business

Gondorff waves okay

GONDORFF
(to Hooker)
Great little countess that Billie
Runs a good house up there too
One of the few left that Luciano

Gondorff walks around on the carousel checking straps
bearing and poles Hooker follows him

HOOKER
(getting impatient)
Gondorff you gonna teach me the
Big Con or not

GONDORFF
(on his back checking
underneath one of the horses)
You didnt act much like you wanted
to learn it

HOOKER
I wanna play for Lonnegan
GONDORFF
(getting up)
You know anything about him

HOOKER
(exploding)
Yeh he croaked Luther What else
do I gotta know

Gondorff just sits tight and waits for him to cool off

HOOKER
(waving Gondorff off
embarrassed at his
own outburst)
Aw right he runs the numbers outta
the south side

GONDORFF

(going over to start

the machinery)
And a packing company a chain of
Savings and Loans and half the
politicians in Chicago and New York
There aint a fix in the world

HOOKER
Ill take him anyway

GONDORFF
(whirling on him)
Why

HOOKER
(like steel)
Cause I dont know enough about
killin to kill him

Its the right answer Gondorff didnt know it himself until
now

GONDORFF
You cant do it alone ya know It
takes a mob of guys like you and
enough money to make em look good

HOOKER
Well get by without em

GONDORFF
This isnt like playin winos on
the street You gotta do more than

HOOKER
(incensed)

GONDORFF
(going right on
ignoring Hookers remark)
You gotta keep Lonnegans con even
after you spent his money And no

HOOKER
Youre sacred of em arent ya

GONDORFF
Right down to my socks turkey If
Ida been half as scared a that

death

HOOKER
Then youll do it

GONDORFF
If I can find a mob thatll risk it
But no matter what happens I dont
want you comin back to me halfway
through and sayin its not enough
cause its all you got

Hooker nods Gondorff switches on the carousel and steps
back to admire his handiwork The carousel makes a grinding
sound does a few lurches and stops cold

CUT TO
Music begins and we are into a short
MONTAGE SEQUENCE
Detailing the arrival of the others three members of
Gondorffs mob Throughout Gondorff wears the fedora hat

which is his trademark We begin with --

A tall good-looking man Kid Twist making his way through
the railway station Impeccably dressed and carrying a
small suitcase he combs the terrain carefully with his eyes
Finally he catches a glimpse of the thing hes been looking
for Its Gondorff standing by a newsstand Gondorff
makes a quick snubbing motion on his nose as if flicking off
a gnat This is known among con men as the office Twist
returns the sign with a barely discernible smile as he walks
on by Con men rarely acknowledge each other openly in
public but its obvious that these two are glad to see each
other

sitting on a lounge reading the paper

CUT TO

Hooker being shown into a small apartment room by an old
woman It consists of a bed a table and a sink Hooker

between the door and the jamb about an inch off the floor

INT A BIG METROPOLITAN BANK - DAY

We hold on a slight bespectacled teller Eddie Niles in
the process of counting a large deposit Niles is all
business if hes ever smiled no one knows about it He
glances up for a second and sees Gondorff officing him
from across the bank Without a word he shoves the money
hes been counting back into the hands of a startled
customer abruptly closes up his window flips his
identification tag on the managers desk and walks out of
the bank

CUT TO
INT AN UPSTAIRS ROOM OF THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - NIGHT

This room has obviously been relegated to the status of the
storage room It contains the water heater mops and
brooms old bed springs etc In the middle of the room a
space has been cleared for a table around which are seated
Hooker Gondorff Niles Singleton and Twist Gondorff is
in his T-shirt but still wears his hat Kid Twist is ina
suit as usual The room is illuminated by a single bare
bulb hanging from the ceiling

TWIST
(showing Hooker
photographs of three men)
These are Combs favorite torpedoes
Riley and Cole

We recognize Riley and Cole as the two guys who got into
Mottolas cab

TWIST
They do most of the small jobs but
Lonnegan might not wanna use em on
you cause theyre kinda messy No
class

We go to Hooker Hes real grateful Billie wearing an
evening dress enters the room and begins gathering up the
empty beer mugs on the table

TWIST
We got reason to believe Riley was
the guy who hit Luther But if you
see either one of these two find
yourself a crowd or take em
someplace you know you can handle
em
GONDORFF
But most of all let us know If
they got a hit on you we gotta
fold up the con Youre too
exposed You got that

Hooker nods but we know he hasnt really got that

HOOKER
You sure itll be one of these two

TWIST
No Theyre just the only ones we
know of

Billie has finished gathering the mugs and leaves the room
with them We follow her down the hall and into the

RECEIVING ROOM OF HER BROTHEL

Carousel music filters up from the arcade below The room
has a bar along one wall and the rest of the space is taken
up by tables and couches Its a comfortable place but not
opulent Some of the girls sit patiently on the couches
others play canasta at the tables Most of the men are at
the bar fortifying themselves for the task at hand Billie
comes over to the bar

BILLIE
(to the bartender)
Set me up five more beers will ya
Danny

As Danny goes to fill the mugs Billies eyes fix on a man
at the end of the bar

We move to reveal Snyder intently scanning the room as if
hed lost a dancing partner in the crush Not finding what
he wants he comes down the bar to Billie

SNYDER

the others talk His eyes flick momentarily to Hooker

SINGLETON

Gondorff smiles broadly then casually to them all

GONDORFF

INT ANOTHER ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Inside is another room this one much better lit than the
outer one There are only three tables in here around
which are seated the elite of the Con World Twist is
enthusiastically greeted by Duke Boudreau a large rotund
man whose stylish dress and authoritative manner mark him as
a powerful figure in this group

BOUDREAU
Twist When did you get back in

The two men sit down together apart from the others

CUT TO
THE OUTER PART OF THE BAR AGAIN

A silhouetted figure appears in the entrance doorway The
word chill races from table to table and the place falls
still The bartender pushes a button behind the bar anda
buzzer goes off in the back room Boudreau gets up from his
table and opens a small viewing port in the door

The silhouetted figure is now walking slowly past the silent
tables Its Snyder and hes checking out every face in the
place

BOUDREAU
Twist you know this guy

TWIST
(taking a look
through the viewing port)
No Never saw him before Hes a
dick though

Snyder walks all the way to the back and then retraces his
route About halfway back he stops at one of the tables
recognizing a grifter he knows Its the Eirie Kid

EIRIE KID
Hello Snyder What are you doin
up here

SNYDER
Im on vacation You seen your
friend lately

EIRIE KID
Yeh he packed it in and enrolled
in detective school

Snyder in no mood for jokes grabs Eirie by the hair and
slams his face into the table Eirie just stays there he
knows it doesnt pay to assault a detective Twist is
watching all this intently from the viewing port

SNYDER
You see him you tell him to pay
his debts before I get him
Eirie raises his head slowly but says nothing There is a
slight trickle of blood from his nose Snyder turns and
walks slowly out of the bar When he is a safe distance
down the street the chatter and drinking resume

CUT TO
THE INSIDE ROOM AGAIN

Twist gives an all clear signal and returns to the table
where he and Boudreau were talking Boudreau reads from a
list of names Twist listens with a certain preoccupation
Hes still thinking about the little confrontation he just
witnessed

BOUDREAU
Paltrow Sterling Furey and the
Big Alabama are in from New Orleans
Fiskin and the Boone Kid from
Denver and Phillips Barnett and
Limehouse Chappie from New York

passenger A hand reaches to pick it up It is Lonnegans
wallet and it is Hooker who picks it up

Hooker waits a moment then stands and goes in the direction
Lonnegan has taken He passes by the open door to the card

exchanged inside before the door is shut Then he continues

tosses the empty wallet back to Hooker and resumes his
shuffling and dealing Hooker sits back silently and
watches him

HOOKER

GONDORFF

Let him wait

As he deals on the second pass he attempts to cut from the

wallet Suddenly the stare goes soft He tries a few more

Theres a knock at the door Floyd goes and opens it Its

Floyd motions him in without a word

LONNEGAN
Your boss is quite a card player
Carver How does he do it

HOOKER

(very matter-of-factly)

Lonnegan says nothing He doesnt like smart asses He
looks Hooker over a second as if considering whether to
have him wasted or not

LONNEGAN
(reaching into his
coat pocket)
Hell have to take a check

I couldnt find my wallet

HOOKER
Yeh he knows that

LONNEGAN
(startled)

Lonnegans wallet and
tossing it to him)
He hired a dame to take it from ya

Lonnegan just holds the wallet He cant believe it

HOOKER
You were set up Lonnegan Shaws

months He was just waiting for
you to cheat him so he could clip ya

LONNEGAN

train for this errand boy

HOOKER
(cool as hell)
So could Shaw

LONNEGAN
Then why the rat

HOOKER
Cause Im tired of bein his nigger
(pause)
I want you to help me break him

Lonnegan looks at Hooker long and hard as if the intensity
of his gaze could separate truth from fiction Lonnegan
hadnt expected this but now that its here it better be
on the level The silence is suddenly broken by the noise
of the train braking into the station

LONNEGAN
(to Hooker)
Cmon Ill give ya a lift home

Hooker hesitates not sure whether to accept or not

LONNEGAN
Whats the matter You gotta get
back to Shaw

HOOKER

Hooker nods and walks up the steps to his apartment building
Lonnegans car speeds away from the curb and on out of sight
Hooker breathes a sigh of relief Hes passed his first
test or has he We follow him up the stairs to his room

INT HOOKERS APARTMENT

Hes just about to unlock the door when he notices the
little piece of paper he left in the door is on the floor
Without the slightest hesitation Hooker leaps over the
bannister and races back down the stairs Two gunmen Riley
and Cole burst out of his room and fire at him over the
railing but hes already too far down Riley and Cole give
chase

CUT TO
THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING

Riley and Cole barrel out of the building and onto the
sidewalk There is an empty bus stopped at a light but
they find no sign of Hooker As the light changes we cut
to the other side of the bus where we see Hooker crouched
on the rear wheel housing hanging on to a vent Hes a
little shaken but most of all hes still alive We hold
on him as the bus moves off

Gondorff has his doubts but lets them ride
CUT TO

OTHER PARTS OF THE STORE

We concentrate on some of the fine details ie Garfield
explaining how the ticker will read out to Singleton and
Billie Curly Jackson showing a younger con man how to mark
the odds board properly

GONDORFF (VO)
How bout Lonnegan

HOOKER (VO)
I gave him the breakdown just like
ya told me to

GONDORFF (VO)
And

HOOKER (VO)
He threatened to kill me

GONDORFF (VO)
Hell they dont do that and you
know youre not gettin through to
em

We concentrate on Niles whos making up the boodles or
fake bankrollls He puts a real 100 bill on the bottom
then two inches of cut green paper on top and then another
100 bill on top of that so that it looks like he has a
whole stack of 100 bills The bundle is then bound with a
sealed label like those used in banks that says 10000
We see that he has already made several of these bundles

HOOKER (VO)
Then he drove me home He tried to
put himself away as legit so I
went right into the pitch

GONDORFF (VO)
Did he hold you up on anything

HOOKER (VO)

WE OPEN ON A WIDE SHOT OF THE ALLEY OUTSIDE THE STORE

At first it appears to be deserted but we move to reveal a
figure in an upper window of the apartment building which
forms one side of the alley Its Kid Twist His eyes roam
the street for what we do not yet know

CUT TO
INT AN OLD DRUGSTORE ACROSS FROM THE ALLEY - DAY

Probably prosperous at one time it has since declined its
large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and
Hooker who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone
Dressed in a tuxedo he nurses a cup of coffee and anxiously
alternates his glances between the clock and the empty

street outside Its 1252

CUT TO
INT THE STORE - DAY

The place is full of people although we avoid long shot so
as not to give away the room as a whole yet Instead we
concentrate on the tense waiting faces of some of the more
familiar people

Gondorff and Niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashiers area
Gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth Niles just
stares out into space cracking his knuckles

GONDORFF
Eddie cut that out will ya

The boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of
his odds board checking every letter and number He stops
to cross a T on one of the horses names It was already
crossed but he does it again anyway
Billie and Singleton in an area hidden from the rest of the
room watching the print-out on the ticker machine The
clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store

Curly Jackson in front of a mirror pasting a fake Van Dyke
on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle

A couple of Billies girls adjusting their waitress outfits
and primping their hair Each has a tray full of drinks
beside her

The Eirie Kid silently retracing his route to make sure he
has it down

Despite the crowd there is no talking and little movement
save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars
and cigarettes The group is like a theatre company waiting
to go on opening night

CUT TO
THE DRUGSTORE AGAIN

Its 1256 and Hooker is worried He looks up to see two
large men obviously racket goons come in the front door
and take a seat facing him in the next booth They stare at
him impassively waving the waitress away when she comes to
take their order Hooker knows theyre Lonnegans men but
is somewhat unsettled by the fact that Lonnegan is not with
them Suddenly a voice

VOICE
Carver

Hooker turns around to find that Lonnegan is seated in the
booth directly behind him His bodyguard is in the one
behind that

LONNEGAN
You should always look to the back
too kid

HOOKER

(sliding out of his

booth and into Lonnegans)
I was afraid you werent gonna come
We havent got much time

LONNEGAN
(curtly)
Get on with it then
HOOKER

(pointing to telephone)
Sometime after 100 a guys gonna
call here and give you the name of

(pulling out a wad of bills)
All you do is take this two grand
across the street to Shaws place
and bet it on that pony Theres
nothin to it but dont take too
much time We only have 3 or 4
minutes after you get the call

LONNEGAN
Youre not gonna break him with a
2000 bet

HOOKER

This is just a test The big one
comes later Be careful with that
though its all I got

LONNEGAN
And you were gonna pay me back

HOOKER
I am after this race

Lonnegan says nothing Hes not sure he likes a man whos
stupid enough to bet his last dollar on a horse race

HOOKER
I gotta get back before Shaw misses
me Good luck

Hooker hustles out across the street and into the alley
INT DRUGSTORE

Lonnegan watches him through the window and then settles

and we hear

TWIST

The receiver clicks down at the other end Lonnegan hangs
up and goes out the door followed by his entourage

EXT STREET

We follow him across the street and into the alley where he
signals one of the bodyguards to check the place out Kid
Twist pushes a button on his window sill and a buzzer goes
off inside the store The previously inert figures there
spring to life

Lonnegans bodyguard descends the stairwell and knocks at
the door where he is greeted by Hooker in the capacity of
host He looks the place over and motions an okay to
Lonnegan

INT THE STORE

As Lonnegan enters we see the room for the first time in
its entirety Overnight it has been transformed into a
swank private club with bar cigarette girls upholstered
furniture and chandeliers
SINGLETON
Look at that Hes got four apes
with him

GONDORFF
Thats what I like about these

protection against things wed

taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people

Cloud

We reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch
which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a
partition

The boardmaker wearing headphones suspended from a sliding
wire hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard
From the loudspeakers we hear the words last flash The
odds on Bluenote settle down to 8 to l

Lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting
line His bodyguards fan out to various positions in the
room The betting crowd itself (known as the boost)
consists of close to twenty people none of whom of course
are what theyre pretending to be There are brokers with
pasty faces sportsmen tanned and casual and financiers
with goatees and highly tailored clothes Large amounts of
money are changing hands at the betting window Boodles are
in sight everywhere

Lonnegan slips into the betting line feeling somewhat
estranged from the general merriment around him There are
two men in line ahead of him The first Curly Jackson

slaps down several bundles of cash in front of Niles whos
the cashier and places a 20000 bet on War Eagle Gondorff
appears at the cashiers window and catches sight of Lonnegan

GONDORFF
Never get enough huh pal Id

The man in front of Lonnegan puts 5000 on Dancing Cloud

comes on the loudspeaker

CALLER

at one of the tables It happens to be the one the Eirie

Kid is at Gondorff and Niles watch it from the cashiers
cage

GONDORFF

The heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused
on the race Several of the patrons begin to yell for their
horses Lonnegan remains seated He seems bored with it

Into the backstretch its War Eagle

Lonnegan perks up just a little Bluenote at least has
moved up The rest of the people in the place are really
rooting now Few of them remain seated

Hooker arrives at the bar with the glasses he cleared from
Lonnegans table Eirie is already there fortifying
himself with a scotch

HOOKER
Youre doin great Eirie He
loves ya

Eirie nods somewhat unconvinced and heads bak to the table

CALLER
Into the far turn its Dancing
Cloud now by half a length War
Eagle is second by two Bluenote is
third by a half and moving fast on
the outside Lucky Lady is fourth

won the night before) Gondorff looks somewhat perturbed
Lonnegan picks up the money and tauntingly waves it at him

GONDORFF

(getting his name

right this time)
Dont bother to come back with a
pikers bet like that again
Lonnegan We got a 5000 minimum
here

(to Hooker)
Show this bum out

Hooker hesitates a second

GONDORFF
Go on ya goddamn ninny

Gondorff gives Hooker a hard shove in the back with his
foot sending him into a table and sprawling to the floor

GONDORFF
(indicating Lonnegans
bodyguards)
And tell him not to bring his
garbage men in here no more This
is a class joint

Hooker pretending to be humiliated gets to his feet and
escorts Lonnegan to the door Lonnegan stops gives Gondorff
a derisive smile and walks out Once hes gone the

general clatter and hubbub in the room cease like it had
been turned off by a faucet Most of the boost sit down and
relax Curly Jackson rips off his Van Dyke Its been
itching him
GONDORFF
Hes gaffed kid He should start
coming to you now

INT COMBS OFFICE AT THE CLEARINGHOUSE - DAY

Combs sits passively on the edge of his desk glancing across
the room every now and then at Riley who is slumped uneasily
in a folding chair looking like a defendant at the
Inquisition Both remain silent like two men in a waiting
room Suddenly what theyve been waiting for arrives
Lonnegan comes into the office flanked by his bodyguards
Skipping the usual pleasantries he walks right over to Riley

LONNEGAN
All right Riley What the hell
happened

RILEY

(not looking at him)
We missed him

LONNEGAN
You werent hired to miss him

RILEY
There wasnt any way he coulda
known we was in there We made a

clean pick on the lock and didnt
leave no footprints in the hall
Somebody musta wised him up

LONNEGAN
Yeh and what does Cole say about
that

RILEY

I dont know He took it hard

LONNEGAN
All right get outa here Youre

Riley gets up and drags himself out the door like a whipped
dog

LONNEGAN

holes in it

Combs gives up The second times the charm

LONNEGAN
And tell Cole I wanta see him when

COMBS

bounced off a job anyway

LONNEGAN
He had his chance and all he did
was shoot up a rooming house Made
a lotte noise and woke up a few
cops but didnt hit nothin’

Combs keeps his mouth shut Theres no way to talk to
Lonnegan when hes like this

LONNEGAN

(cooling a little)
This is Salinos job now Vince
If Cole wants to muscle in on it
thats his business But hes
breakin the rules and when Salino
finds out about it I cant feel
sorry for whats gonna happen to him

CUT TO
INT LONNEGANS HOTEL - DAY

The finest the period had to offer We pick up Hooker
coming down the hall to Lonnegans suite He is admitted by
the Bodyguard Lonnegan wearing a smoking jacket is
seated at a table counting a pile of money There are two

other assistants standing behind him

They dont look

friendly

HOOKER
Well what did I tell ya

LONNEGAN
Youre a lucky man all right

HOOKER
Lucky hell I could do it every
day

LONNEGAN

HOOKER

LONNEGAN
You got a system Carver

HOOKER

HOOKER

(drawing up a chair

barely able to

contain his enthusiasm)
Its foolproof We got a partner
downtown runs the central office of
the Western Union Race results
from all over the country come in
there and go right across his desk
on their way to the bookies All
he does in hold them up a couple
minutes until he can call us and
get a bet down on the winner Then
he releases the results to the
bookies and we clean up on a race
thats already been run It cant
miss unless the Western Union
Dicks get onto it

Lonnegan is amazed He sits back a second then comes
forward again and pushes a pile of bills over to Hooker
Hooker smiles and begins to count the money

LONNEGAN
You got the 400 grand yet

HOOKER
Not yet but
(stopping suddenly)
Hey theres only a grand here

LONNEGAN
(more like a command)
I think we oughta place another bet
tomorrow

HOOKER
(getting angry)
What is this Thats my money
You tryin to muscle me

LONNEGAN
(controlled)
If your systems as foolproof as
you say youll get even more

Hookers in a jam and he knows it

HOOKER
(after a pause)
I gotta talk to me partner first
We cant afford to expose our game
too much

LONNEGAN
Let me talk to him

HOOKER
(flatly)
No

LONNEGAN
You want your money back Try and
get it in a court of law
(softening a bit)
Cmon dont be a sorehead Ill

Hooker says nothing for a minute and then reluctantly nods
his head

HOOKER
Four oclock tomorrow Pick me up
at Dewey Lyles

CUT TO
EXT LONNEGANS HOTEL - DAY

We pick up Hooker coming out of the hotel and going off down
the street As he does so we pull back all the way across
the street and through the interior of a parked car to
reveal the silhouette of a man seated at the wheel We move
to his right hand which rests on the steering column Its
covered by a black glove and the middle finger is missing
His trigger finger however taps lightly on the wheel

CUT TO
INT AN INDOOR TELEPHONE BOOTH - DAY
One of the old wooden kind -- accordian doors with glass
panes in the upper half Hooker dials rapidly
HOOKER
Twist I told him the tale He
wants to see ya
TWIST
All right when
HOOKER
Tomorrow after 400 Stay inside

Ill come in and get ya And be
hard on him for a while hes
talking money

TWIST
Okay Tootsie

Hooker blows a mock kiss through the phone and hangs up He
turns to leave the booth when suddenly he sees something
that stops him cold There looking through the glass is the
smirking face of Detective Synder Hooker is immobilized
Snyder puts his hand inside his coat and slowly draws out
his gun He points it right at Hookers face and then
violently smashes all the glass in the upper half of the
door with the barrel Fragments of glass spray into the
booth a couple of which imbed themselves in Hookers cheek

Hooker quickly whips open the door trapping Snyders hand
in the accordian and jarring loose his gun Hooker sprints
out of the booth as Snyder scrambles for his pistol and
gives pursuit

EXT ALLEYS AND SIDESTREETS - NIGHT - THE TWO MEN

We follow the two men up alleys and sidestreets as they race
through the dregs of the city two panting shadows moving
through places that only get light at night The wind blows
drops of blood off Hookers cheek as he runs Snyder still
has his gun but would rather inflict pain than death

CONDEMNED BUILDING

Hooker makes for a condemned building and scrambles up the
stairs steps giving way under him as he goes

INT BUILDING

On the fourth floor he ducks into a room and quickly locks
the door

We pan the room to reveal that the whole back side of the
building is gone Hooker runs toward the ledge and leaps
through the air landing on the fire escape of an adjacent
building some 15 feet away He kicks in a window and goes
off down the hall We cut back to

Snyder furiously kicking in the locked door He finally
crashes through only to find an empty room and a beautiful
panorama of the city and its nearest Hooverville

LONG SHOT - HOOKER

Winding his way through the slum area of town dashing along
backstreets over fences and through vacant lots making
good his escape From our angle he looks like a rat ina
maze

GONDORFF (VO)

before
HOOKER (VO)
I thought Id lost him

CUT TO
INT GONDORFFS ROOM AT THE CAROUSEL BUILDING - DAY

Hooker sits sullenly at the table Billie stands over him

INT A SLEEPY DINER - LATE AFTERNOON

Located across the street from Hookers apartment building
Hooker sits down alone in a booth with a plate of ham and
eggs hes hardly touched

The two cuts on his face have pretty much stopped bleeding
A big fan above the counter area drones away lethargically
its air stream insufficient to either cool the place or
drive out the smell of onions and grease

A waitress Loretta emerges from the kitchen and ambles
slowly over to Hookers table Slim and raven-haired she
manifests an indifference bred from years spent delivering
things to people who are rarely grateful for what she brings
Only a light scar on her left cheek hints at another side

LORETTA
You done

HOOKER
Yeh I guess I shoulda had the meat
loaf
LORETTA

HOOKER

TWIST

Harmon is resigned Twist and Singleton pick up their gear
and march into the office Once inside we notice that the
office has an exit door which opens to an outside alley
Twist immediately removes his overalls revealing the suit
and tie hes wearing underneath He takes out a picture of
himself a woman and three small children and puts it on
Harmons desk replacing a similiar picture of Harmons
family Singleton meanwhile has spread a few tarps and
begins to paint the walls

Hooker sits at the counter finishing a plate of meat loaf
Loretta is down at the cash register leaning on the counter
looking idly out into space Hooker glances over at her
every once in a while to see if she might be interested in
striking up a little conversation Shes not He finishes
his meal and comes down to the register to pay his bill

HOOKER

Across the street in a doorway is the silhouette of a man
Its Cole Hes pretending not to look at the diner but
Hooker isnt fooled

INT DINER
He goes back to Loretta at the register

HOOKER
You got a back door to this place

LORETTA

HOOKER
(evenly)
Hed like to kill me

Loretta just looks at him a second Realizing that this is
no joke she turns and walks slowly but steadily to the
bathroom Hooker waits until shes out of sight

EXT STREET

Hooker goes to the front door and steps outside Cole looks
up at the sound of the door Hooker makes a big show of
spotting him and runs back into the diner Cole his cover
blown draws his gun and races across the street in pursuit
Arriving just in time to see --

INT DINER

Hooker go into the bathroom he charges in after him only
to find the place empty He goes quickly from stall to
stall on the chance that Hooker might be hiding in one of
them

He comes to one thats closed and seeing a pair of womans
legs under the door rejects that and moves on to the next
one

We cut inside the stall to reveal Loretta sitting on the
toilet with her skirt hiked up Right behind her crouched
on the back of the seat is Hooker

Cole has finished his rapid inspection now and having found
nothing looks around for Hookers probable escape route

He sees the open window and climbs out to find himself ina
small air shaft from which he knows Hooker could not escape
Hooker seizing the time bursts out of the stall and runs
back out through the diner Cole sees him but too late to
get off a shot He climbs back in the window and gives chase

EXT STREET

We pick up Hooker barreling down the street with Cole a
hundred yards or so behind Hooker makes a sharp cut into
an alley and we see immediately that its a hopeless dead
end Inexplicably he makes no attempt to run back out

Cole draws up and cuts into the alley anticipating the kill
which should be easy now He prepares to sight down his
victim when suddenly he realizes there is no victim in
sight Hooker miraculously has vanished Cole scans the
alley frantically for some trace of him There are no
windows or doors at the street level Not even a drain pipe
Just brick wall Its impossible Hooker has disappeared
into thin air
Cole slams his gun into his shoulder holster with a curse
and starts back out of the alley when all of a sudden he
stops in utter terror His mouth drops open and he chokes
out the words

COLE
Salino hey look I didnt mean to
move in on

Before anything else can come out two bullets rip into his
chest He falls to the concrete coming to rest ona
manhole cover which we notice is slightly ajar We

CUT TO
THE SEWER PIPES

Beneath the manhole We see Hooker making his way through
the slop having gained another reprieve but unaware that
with two down there is still one to go

INT HOOKERS APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

Hooker comes in the front entrance and goes to the elevator
one of the old-fashioned kind with the iron grid on the
inside Hes still a little rattled and waiting for the
elevator is making him restless It finally arrives and he
steps inside closing the grid behind him As he starts to
push the button for his floor he realizes for the first
time that hes not alone He looks to the corner to find
Snyder holding a gun on him This time theres not much
doubt that hell use it if necessary

INT GONDORFFS ROOM - NIGHT

Gondorff and Hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking
Gondorff makes little comments as he plays but Hooker is
quiet and withdrawn The carousel is not in operation and a
heavy silence hangs over the place

GONDORFF
Whats the matter kid Youre not
sayin much

HOOKER
Just a little nervous thats all

GONDORFF
Luther always told me to bite my
toenails when I get nervous You
see yourself doin that and you
realize it aint worth it

Hooker smiles feebly
Billie appears at the door

BILLIE
Things are a little slow tonight
Henry I wanna open the round for
the girls

Gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her
She leaves to go start the merry-go-round Gondorff settles
back into the game

GONDORFF
Take it easy you wont lose him
now We had him 10 years ago when
he decided to be somebody Believe
me Ive seen enough to know

HOOKER
(softly)
How many guys you conned in your
life Henry

GONDORFF

Two or three hundred I guess
Sometimes played two a day when I
was in Sheas mob We had it down
to a business

(pause)
Course Chicago was a right town
then The fix was in The dicks
took their end without a beef All
the Wall Street boys wanted to make
investments for us Even had marks
looking us up thinkin they could
beat the game

(pause)
Yeh kid it really stunk No
sense in bein a grifter if its
the same as bein a citizen

Gondorff chucks his cards on the table Hes through for
the night

GONDORFF
I better do some packin Im
gonna be a hot number again after
tomorrow

HOOKER

Then why you doin it

GONDORFF
Seems worthwhile doesnt it
Maybe its just for the cave-in on
Lonnegans face when we put in the
sting

Thats good enough Hooker gets up to leave

HOOKER
Henry
HOOKER
Yeh
HOOKER
(apologetically)

neck out I wouldnt have asked ya

GONDORFF
Aint nothin gonna make up for
Luther kid

(pause)
Revenge is for suckers I been
griftin 30 years and never got any

Hooker just nods and walks out the door
INT CAROUSEL

We follow him past the Carousel which is now full of giggling
prostitutes in various stages of undress Their childish
frolicking is charming from a group usually so jaded but
its lost on Hooker tonight

CUT TO
EXT A CITY STREET - NIGHT

Its late now and the street is deserted save for an
occasional derelict or streetwalker on her way home from a
nights work We pick up Hooker coming down the street
toward his apartment building He walks slowly almost
reluctantly as if he didnt care whether he ever got there
or not

As he nears his building he notices Loretta coming out of
the diner across the street He stops and watches as she
looks up and disappears into an adjacent building that
advertises rooms for rent After a few seconds we see a
light come on in one of its second story windows

Hooker just stands there a second debating with himself
trying to figure out a reason for doing what hes going to
do anyway We follow him across the street to Lorettas
building and

INT LORRETAS

He goes up the stairs to the room where the light came on
He passes a couple of derelicts on the way He knocks twice
and Loretta answers in her bathrobe She is more than a
little startled to see him

LORETTA
Looks like he missed ya

HOOKER
Yeh this time anyway

Loretta notices an old busybody peeping out at them from her
room across the hall
LORETTA
Good night Mrs Hillard

Mrs Hillard quickly closes her door

HOOKER
(shuffling a little)
I ahthought you might wanna
come out for a while Maybe have a
drink or somethin’

LORETTA
You move right along dont ya

HOOKER
(with more innocence
than confidence)
I dont mean nothin by it I just
dont know many regular girls
thats all

LORETTA
And you expect me to come over
just like that

HOOKER
If I expected somethin I wouldnt
be still standin out here in the
hall

Loretta looks at him carefully She knows its not a line

LORETTA
(with less resistance now)
I dont even know you

HOOKER
(slowly)
You know me Im just like you
Its two in the morning and I dont
know nobody

The two just stand there in silence a second Theres
nothing more to say She stands back and lets him in

CUT TO

A record spinning lazily on an old phonograph We hear
Robert Johnsons Come On In My Kitchen Gondorff is
sitting up in bed with his hat on lost in thought Billie
is curled up asleep next to him Theres a packed suitcase
next to the bed Billie wakes up and turns over a second

BILLIE

Gondorff nods his agreement like a zombie and goes right on
thinking

LORRETAS ROOM

Hooker and Loretta are asleep against each other their
bodies illuminated every few seconds by the light from a

neon sign across the street We dolly to the window and
move in on another window in the building next door Theres
no light on in it but we can discern the basic outline of a
face behind the curtains which are slightly parted to
afford a view of Hookers room by a black-gloved hand

IT said come on in my kitchen
Cause its gonna be rainin outdoors

Music ends

FADE OUT

We open on Hooker in bed the morning sun streaming in on
his face He awakens slowly looks at the ceiling for a
second and remembering last night turns to the side to
find that Loretta is no longer there Still drowsy he gets
out of bed and looks around the room for a note or some
evidence of her continued presence He opens an empty
closet then opens empty drawers Finding nothing he
suddenly hits on another possibility and looks in his
wallet The money is still there Almost disappointed he
slumps down in a chair as the harsh reality of what will
happen this day floods back in on him Music begins and we

EXT HOOKERS APARTMENT

We pick him up emerging from the building and follow him
around the corner to a secluded alley which he generally
takes on his way to the store As he walks along he

notices Loretta coming toward him from the other end Shes

comes closer we move to reveal the gunman appearing suddenly
in the alley behind and to the right of Hooker

EXT ALLEYWAY

The gunman quickly takes out his revolver braces it in the
crook of his hand and takes careful aim Loretta sees him

Lonnegan hangs up with the look of the financial killer
Eight to one odds is more than even he could have hoped for

EXT STREET

We follow Lonnegan across the street and into the store
The bodyguards remain outside

INT THE STORE

The store is buzzing with activity Money and booze are
everywhere The sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly
keep up with the action Lonnegan walks quickly to the
betting line and finds to his relief that theres only one
man ahead of him The man puts 25000 on Kings Image

Lonnegan steps to the window swings up the brief case and
opens it for Niles to see

LONNEGAN
(straight-faced)
Five hundred grand on Syphon

Niles is struck dumb Hes never seen that much money before

NILES
(playing the flustered
clerk)
Hold on Ill have to get the
manager

Niles goes and returns with Gondorff

GONDORFF
Whats the problem

NILES
(pointing to the
brief case)
He wants to put a half million on
Syphon

Gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at
Lonnegan like hes gotta be crazy

GONDORFF
(uneasily)
I cant lay that off in time We
lose a bet that big it could break
us

LONNEGAN
(challenging)
If ya win it could make ya too

GONDORFF
(to Niles)
What are the odds on Syphon

NILES
Eight to one

Gondorff looks at Lonnegan long and hard

GONDORFF
A half mill on an eight to one shot
Youre dumber than I thought
Lonnegan

LONNEGAN
Youre more gutless than I thought

The words Last Flash are heard on the speaker Gondorff
looks at Lonnegan with utter contempt He turns to Niles

GONDORFF
(chopped)
Take it

Niles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500000 dollars
Lonnegan allowing himself a sly smile picks it up and
retires to a nearby table He flashes a little okay sign to
Hooker who acknowledges it with a nod

CALLER
Ladies and gentlemen this is
Arnold Rowe your caller for the
San Antonio Handicap at Pimlico in
Baltimore -- A mile and 116 for
three-year-olds And theyre off

Lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair
the larceny boiling in his veins Hooker looks to Gondorff
Gondorff gives him the office Hooker has to smile

CALLER
And around the first turn its
Kings Image by a neck Syphon is
second by one Key to the Vault
third by one half followed by Mr
Moonlight Red Ridge Moneyman and
No Charge

Unexpectedly Kid Twist bursts in through the entrance
Barely able to control his enthusiasm he hurries over to
Lonnegans table and sits down next to him

TWIST
Sorry but I just couldnt wait
Did everything go all right

LONNEGAN
(motioning for him to
keep his voice down)
Take it easy Everythings all
right I put it on Syphon on the
nose

TWIST
(in utter horror)
On the nose I said place Place
it on Syphon That horse is going
to run second

Lonnegan looks like hes just been stabbed He vaults over
the table to the tellers window and grabs Niles

LONNEGAN
You give me my goddamn money back
You hear me Theres been a mistake

NILES
Im sorry sir The bettings
closed

Lonnegan begins to shake him violently
LONNEGAN
You give me my money back Theres

been a mistake do you hear me

Gondorff leaps to Niles aid when suddenly there is a crash
at the entrance door and Polk Snyder and eight federal
agents burst into the room guns drawn The place falls
silent except for the loudspeaker the members of the boost
afraid to move Gondorff and Niles look at each other
wondering how this could have possibly happened

POLK
(motioning to Hooker)
All right Hooker you can go

Hookers eyes go to Gondorff who looks back at him in utter
disbelief the betrayal raging in his features Hooker
unable to meet his gaze lowers his head and starts to walk
out Almost unnoticed theres a flash of movement at
Gondorffs belt A small gun A shot Hooker clutches his
back and falls dead on the floor the blood spurting from
his mouth Polk reacting instantly pours four shots into
Gondorff who goes down in a heap Pandemonium breaks loose
The members of the boost race for the door Lonnegan is
totally stunned First he lost his money and now hes
involved in a murder Snyder rushes over to him

SNYDER
Cmon We gotta get you outa here

EXT STREET

Snyder drags him through the crowd and out onto the street
where an FBI car is waiting His bodyguards have long
since fled at the sight of the FBI men

LONNEGAN
My moneys back there

SNYDER
Well worry about that later

Snyder gets in beside Lonnegan and the car speeds away
CUT TO
INSIDE THE STORE AGAIN

The pandemonium has now ceased Those who could escape
have the rest are lined up against the wall in frisking
position Gondorff and Hooker lie on the floor dead The
loudspeaker drones on Singleton is still calling the race
from his booth apparently oblivious to whats happened

CALLER
And the winner is Kings Image by
four lengths Syphon is second by
two Moneyman third by two and one
half Time for 1 and 116 miles
121 and 210 seconds

Polk walks slowly over to Hookers body and bends down

POLK
Hes gone

Hooker opens his eyes and slowly drags himself up off the
floor spitting out a little rubber bladder filled with
blood that hes had in his mouth Gondorff does likewise
Niles Twist Singleton and the rest of the boost begin to
laugh and shake hands as do the Federal Agents

GONDORFF
(to Polk)
Nice con Hickey I thought you
were Feds myself when you first
came in

HICKEY
No problem Henry Snyder went for
it all the way
(laughing)
You shoulda seen the rag he lit
under Lonnegan

Gondorff turns to the others

GONDORFF

Gondorff walks over to Hooker whos wiping the blood off
his face and hands

GONDORFF
You beat him kid

HOOKER
(softly)
You were right Henry Its not
enough But its close
GONDORFF

You wanta wait for your share

HOOKER
Naw Id just blow it
Gondorff nods and walks slowly to behind the bar He comes
out with his suitcase in one hand and Hookers paper bag in
another He throws the paper bag to Hooker who stops by
the door Eirie Kid is standing there Hooker gives the
office to Eirie who beams and gives it back

EXT ALLEY AND STREET

Then Hooker and Gondorff leave We hold on them two
ragtail grifters again as they walk off down the street and
disappear around the corner

FADE OUT
