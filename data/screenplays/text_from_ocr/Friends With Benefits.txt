the love of my life And I was too
stupid to see it I lost her because
of something so dumb I cant even

remember

DYLAN
You never mentioned her before the
other day

MR HARPER

Because I have you and Annie I have
absolutely no regrets But I dont
know if I ever really got over Dede
That might be part of the reason
your mother left

DYLAN
What

MR HARPER
My friends used to say the way Dede
and I looked at each other was
electric And I just let her go I
was too proud to let her know how I
really felt

Dylan takes this in

MR HARPER
Thats one thing this is teaching me --
