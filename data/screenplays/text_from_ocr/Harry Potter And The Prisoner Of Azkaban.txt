The blankets bloom once again when down the hall a

He peers inside eyes flashing suspiciously then
withdraws

The tent rises

The DOORBELL CHIMES and a shrill VOICE THUNDERS

AUNT PETUNIA (0S)
Harry Harry

Harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall
where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly
Petunia flicks a bit of fluff from Dudleys sweater
glowers crossly at Harry and jerks her head toward the
door

AUNT PETUNIA
Well go on Open it

Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM -- it BURSTS
OPEN revealing a LARGE WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and
a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER) Uncle Vernon lurches

forward out of the teeming RAIN an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in
hand and drops it on Harry

AUNT PETUNIA
Marge Welcome How was the
train

AUNT MARGE
Wretched Ripper got sick

AUNT PETUNIA
Ah How unfortunate

AUNT MARGE
I wouldve left him with the
others but he pines so when Im
away Dont you darling

Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down
the hallway Harry follows with Uncle Vernon

( )

HARRY
Uncle Vernon I need you to sign
this form

UNCLE VERNON
What is it

HARRY
Nothing Something for school

Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in Harrys hand
suspiciously

UNCLE VERNON
Later perhaps If you behave

HARRY
I will if she does

AUNT MARGE
(turning eyeing Harry)
So Still here are you

HARRY
Yes

AUNT MARGE
Don’t say ‘yes in that ungrateful
tone Damn good of my brother to
keep you if you ask me

(to Vernon Petunia)

Itd have been straight to an
orphanage if hed been dumped on
my doorstep

Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV --
emits a HOLLOW BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE

AUNT MARGE
Is that my Dudders Hm Is that
my neffy poo Come and say hello
to your Auntie Marge

Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES Dudley blinks
waddles forward and extends his plump palm obediently
Harry looks on then sees Ripper snuffling about his
ankle

INT FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DINING ROOM - DUSK

As Harry clears the dishes Uncle Vernon brings out a
bottle of brandy

( )

UNCLE VERNON
Can I tempt you Marge

AUNT MARGE
Just a small one A bit more a
bit more Thats the boy
(taking a
sloppy sip)

Aah Excellent nosh Petunia
Its normally just a fry-up for
me what with twelve dogs

She smacks her lips lowers her brandy and lets Ripper
take a slobbery lap out of the glass then catches
Harry looking

AUNT MARGE
What are you smirking at Where
is it that you send him Vernon

UNCLE VERNON
St Brutuss Its a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases

Hearing this Harry frowns glances at Uncle Vernon who
glares darkly at him

AUNT MARGE
I see And do they use the cane
at St Brutuss boy

HARRY
(sarcastically)
Oh yes Ive been beaten loads
of times
AUNT MARGE

Excellent I wont have this
namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense
about not hitting people who
deserve it

(another sip)
Still Mustnt blame yourself for
how this ones turned out Vernon
It all comes down to blood Bad

boys father did Petunia

AUNT PETUNIA

(agitated)
Nothing That is he didnt

AUNT MARGE

HARRY

Aunt Marge pauses on her wine eyes narrowing on Harry

AUNT MARGE
What did you say

HARRY
My dad wasnt a drunk

POP The GLASS in Aunt Marges hand EXPLODES

AUNT PETUNIA
Oh my goodness Marge

AUNT MARGE
Not to worry Petunia I have a
very firm grip

Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise

UNCLE VERNON
You go to bed Now

AUNT MARGE
Quiet Vernon It doesnt matter
about the father In the end it
comes down to the mother You see
it all the time with dogs If
theres something wrong with the
bitch therell be something wrong

HARRY
Shut up Shut up

Aunt Marge starts to reply when -- ZING -- a BUTTON on
her dress sails into the air SEAMS GROAN THREAD
SNAPS Aunt Marges eyes WIDEN Her cheeks BILLOW Her
whole body BILLOWS And she begins to INFLATE like a
MONSTROUS BALLOON

about An empty PLAYGROUND SWINGS CREAKING gently on
rusted chains A tiny CAROUSEL kissed gently by the
wind turning slowly

Harry drops the trunk Sits Deep in the night an
ALARM SHRIEKS goes SILENT Harry still as a statue
Listening In the trees above LEAVES TREMBLE The WIND
gathers

Harry turns studies the swaying swings the carousel

Then he stiffens Turns back Sensing something in
the shadows across the street he rises Slowly draws
his wand

Then he sees it Something BIG Darker than the

shadows which conceal it Something with WIDE GLEAMING
EYES

Harry steps back Afraid to look Afraid not to Wand
outstretched he TRIPS tumbles over the forgotten
trunk The tip of his wand BLAZES

BANG TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night

Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to
Tom who works a grimy thumb into his gum frees a walnut
sliver

HARRY
No thank you Minister I dont
understand I broke the law
Underage wizards arent allowed to
use magic at home --

CORNELIUS FUDGE

The Dementors will be stationed at
the entrances to the grounds While
they are under strict orders not to
enter the castle itself you will on
occasion see them as you go about
your daily activities Under no
circumstances are you to approach
them It is not in the nature of
a Dementor to be forgiving

HARRY
Listen you stupid prat --

Eyes WIDENING in fear Malfoy steps back points

DRACO
Potter theres a Dementor behind

Harry JUMPS wheels in fear finds nothing Instantly
the SLYTHERINS make an eerie OOH and OOH sound then

break up laughing Harry reddens embarrassed then

A STRANGE BEAST (BUCKBEAK) emerges from the trees It
has the torso hind legs and tail of a horse but the
front legs wings and head of a giant eagle The
students step back in fear then Hagrid appears shooing
the beast on

HAGRID
Gee up there
(grinning)
Beauiful isn he

( ) 44

There seems no consensus on this but the students stare
in wary wonder nonetheless As Hagrid coaxes the beast
to the center of the paddock Ron stares uneasily

RON

hindquarters

HAGRID

As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD Harry slides scarily back
giant WINGS unfold huge and powerful and -- WHOOSH --
they SOAR into the air Rising higher And higher

And higher

Gradually Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeaks neck
Losing himself in the joy of flying Smiling at the
sight of his and Buckbeaks SHADOW racing across the
grass below Circling over the Whomping Willow past
Hogwarts castle and then SWOOPING with heart-stopping
speed over the Black Lake Buckbeaks talons tickling
the smooth glass of the water summoning the GIANT SQUID
to the surface briefly Hagrid WHISTLES then and
Buckbeak wheels beating his way back to the paddock
galloping to a halt As Harry slides off the class
CHEERS -- all except Draco who narrows his eyes
maliciously

HAGRID
Good work Harry
(under his breath)
Howm I doin me firs day

HARRY

They both grin when Draco pushes past them roughly
strides toward Buckbeak

Buckbeak WHIPS AROUND raises its talons and -- seeing
Harry -- lowers them Ducks its beak Harry
realizing what hes done breathes

Thats a Boggart that is

(muttering softly)
Its this class thats ridiculous

Good So much for the easy part
You see the incantation alone
is not enough What really

to assume a shape you find truly
amusing Neville come up here

Professor can I ask you
something

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Youd like to know why I stopped
you from facing the Boggart
(off Harrys surprise)
I should think itd be obvious I
assumed the Boggart would take the
shape of Lord Voldemort

Harry frowns Lupin studies him curiously

PROFESSOR LUPIN
But clearly I was wrong

HARRY
I did think of Voldemort first
But then I remembered that night
on the train and the
Dementors

Well well Im impressed That
suggests that what you fear most

of all is fear Very wise

Before I fainted I heard

something A woman Screaming

worst memories of our lives Our
pain becomes their power

night she was murdered

The first time I saw you Harry I
recognized you immediately Not
by your scar By your eyes
Theyre your mother Lilys

(nodding)

Yes I knew her She was there
for me at a time when no one else
was We used to talk for hours
She was not only a singularly
gifted witch but an uncommonly
kind woman She had a way of
seeing the beauty in whoever she
met even -- and perhaps most
especially -- when that person
couldnt see it in themselves

Lupins eyes glaze in memory then he blinks smiles

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Which perhaps explains her
affection for your father James
had shall we say a certain
talent for trouble A gift rumor
has it he passed on to you

Lupin turns eyes Harry affectionately Harry smiles
vaguely

PROFESSOR LUPIN

I could tell you stories -- and
there are many about your parents

remembered

When did she come in Did you see
her come in

SNAPE
Now Which of you can tell me the
difference between an Animagus and
a werewolf

As the class stares mutely at a SLIDE of an ATTACKING
WEREWOLF Hermione waiting desperately for someone to
respond to Snapes question the moth flutters by Harry

( ) 65

SWAT He pins it to his desk A tiny cloud of moth dust
mushrooms into the air and Harry lifts his palm
Malfoys PARCHMENT has reappeared

SNAPE
No one How disappointing

HERMIONE
Please sir an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn
into an animal A werewolf has no choice in the matter
Furthermore the werewolf actively hunts humans and
responds only to the call of its own kind --
Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL

SNAPE
Quiet Malfoy Though one must
admit to feeling your pain That
is the second time you have spoken
out of turn Miss Granger Tell
me Are you incapable of
restraining yourself Or do you
take pride in being an
insufferable know-it-all

RON
(to Harry)
Hes got a point you know

Harry stares at the parchment Malfoy has drawn a crude
caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING over and over

SNAPE

Five points from Gryffindor

(to the class)
As a antidote to your ignorance I
prescribe two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf by Monday morning
with particular emphasis placed on
recognizing it

(suddenly )
Passing notes Potter

Snape SNATCHES the drawing from under Harrys nose Eyes
it

SNAPE
Not exactly Picasso are you I
hope you demonstrate more talent
on the Quidditch pitch this
weekend then you do as an artist
(MORE )

SNAPE (CONTD)

If not I fear youll perish

given the weather forecast Until

that time however youll forgive

me if I dont let you off

assure you you need not hand it

As Snape turns away Malfoy sniggers with Crabbe Coyle
and PIKE Harry glances down at the drawing once more
and we hear a true RUMBLE of THUNDER and --

EXT QUIDDITCH PITCH - A STITCH OF LIGHTNING - DAY 68

as it strikes one of the GOLDEN QUIDDITCH RINGS and the
clouds bloom with ICY BLUE light Far below in the
stands RAIN lashes the SEA OF UMBRELLAS As one flies
free soaring end over end into the sky the

-- CROWD EXPLODES and two Quidditch squads -- Gryffindor
in SCARLET Hufflepuff in CANARY-YELLOW -- shoot into the
air Twin BLUDGERS FIRE skyward and the match is on

We CUT INTO Harry rising like a rocket through the mist
his robes SNAPPING VIOLENTLY in the wind

INTERCUT HARRYS POV

-- as he flies RAIN falling like NEEDLES before him
every dark cloud concealing potential danger Beaters
crisscross his path A BLUDGER WHIZZES past then a
second ROCKETS DIRECTLY AT HIM

SWOOP -- Harry ducks watches the BLUDGER SHATTER the
BROOM of a HUFFLEPUFF BEATER The Beater goes into a
wild spiral vanishes in the mist

IN THE STANDS

Ron squints upward the players little more than
STREAKING BLURS from his vantage KA-SSSST A STITCH OF
LIGHTNING strikes the TAIL of ANGELINA JOHNSONS broom
As it BURSTS into FLAMES she PLUMMETS to the pitch Ron
looks down at his own HAND In the HIGHLY-CHARGED AIR
the HAIR above his knuckles RISES

In the sky Harry flies fearlessly searching for the
Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and
CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF VIEW far below Suddenly in
the stands opposite a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand
of a RAVENCLAW GIRL For a moment it sails wondrously
through the heavy air a Magritte dream then -- WHOOP
WHOOP WHOOP -- abruptly picks up speed ROTATING LIKE
A HATCHET Harry DUCKS turns and watches it disappear
into a bank of clouds Then

something GLIMMERS the Snitch Instantly Harry
jets off closing fast on the tiny glimmering ball

chasing it through one cloud then another and
another until
he BREAKS into a clear patch of sky only to find

the Snitch is gone Angrily Harry whips the Nimbus back
around searching the horizon frantically when he spies
something

In the stadiums HIGHEST TOWER something ENORMOUS
flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE then is obscured by a
veil of mist

Harry turns In the distance the stray umbrella spins
INTO VIEW harpoons a player Harrys eyes shift The
SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of

a cloud Harry begins to go when the veil of mist
shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief
moment -- a GREAT DOG is revealed As this mist closes

Harry frowns jets away

As Harry pelts after the Snitch the crowd RISES TO THEIR
FEET ROARING Ron GRINS over the binoculars watching
Harry shred the mist as he urges his broom on

HARRY
Come on Faster

The trace of a smile forms on Harrys lips as he closes
on the Snitch only yards away reaching out
when

( ) 68

- a THIN GLAZE of ICE clouds his GLASSES He wipes at
them then flinches BLOOD trickles down his cheek The
rain is turning to needles Needles of ice Harry
glances at the HANDLE of his BROOMSTICK The water
sluicing through the grain is FREEZING VAPOR streams
from his mouth and nose

SWOOSH A dark SILHOUETTE passes on his right He
turns SWOOSH -- a twin SILHOUETTE passes on his left
Harry sees neither Looks down The layers of mist are
parting below LIGHTNING STRIKES Reveals an ARMY OF
SILHOUETTES drifting onto the pitch A vast legion of
them

DEMENTORS

A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND rises in pitch
not a whistle at all but a SCREAM A WOMANS SCREAM
Harrys eyes flutter and wisps of SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
float from his mouth His glasses glaze over completely
His fingers rigid can no longer grip the broom and

He FALLS

HERMIONE
No

Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions

The Nimbus soars end over end tossed by the currents
then drops right into the Whomping Willow

FLOOMPH Harry in freefall drops through one cloud
then another Plummeting through the circling Dementors

Then a TALL FIGURE rises from the crowd Raises an
OPEN HAND to the heavens Eyes angry but clear
Dumbledore

An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the
air

A FLASH -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky
And then

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK
Not a sound For the longest time Then VOICES

FRED
Peaky What dyou expect him to
look like He fell fifty feet

GEORGE
Yeah cmon Ron Well walk you

Harry opens his eyes and Ron Fred George and Hermione
SLOWLY COME INTO FOCUS standing at the foot of his bed

INT HOSPITAL WING - DAY 69

Silence Uncomfortable glances

HERMIONE
No one blames you Harry The

furious After he saved you he
sent them straight off

Harry nods grimly stares at the RAIN LASHING the window

RON
Theres something else you should
know Harry Your Nimbus -- when
it blew away -- it sort of landed

in the Whomping Willow And well

He tips a BAG of SPLINTERED WOOD and TWISTED TWIGS onto
the bed As Harry stares we hear a gentle WIND then

PROFESSOR LUPIN (VO)

Theres no chance of fixing it

EXT BLACK LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON

Harry shakes his head in response to Lupins question
then -- WHOOSH -- sets Hedwig free of her traces As
she soars into the sky Harry and Lupin watch from the
lakes edge

HARRY
Why do they affect me so
Professor I mean more than
everyone else

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors are among the foulest
creatures that walk this earth
They feed on every good feeling
every happy memory until a person
is left with nothing but his worst
experiences Youre not weak
Harry The Dementors affect you
most because there are true
horrors in your past Horrors
your classmates can scarcely
imagine You have nothing to be
ashamed of

HARRY
Im scared Professor

Id consider you a fool if you
werent

I need to learn how to fight them
You could teach me Professor
You made that Dementor on the

PROFESSOR LUPIN
There was only one that night

HARRY
But you made it go away

PROFESSOR LUPIN
(a beat)
I dont pretend to be an expert
Harry But yes I can teach you
Perhaps after the holiday For
now though I need to rest Im
feeling tired

Harry turns studies Lupins haggard face A weary smile
appears as Hedwigs reflection glides over Lupins

MADAM ROSMERTA
Lets hear it

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Years ago when Harry Potters
parents were marked for death
they went into hiding Few knew
where they were One who did was
black And he told

MADAM ROSMERTA
You-Know-Who Ive heard this
rot It was all over The Daily
Prophet back in the day And Ill
say now what I said then Of all
the boys I ran out of here
Blacks the last who wouldve gone
over to the dark side Hearsay
Thats all the Ministry had
Hearsay

CORNELIUS FUDGE
Ha Tell that to Peter Pettigrew

MADAM ROSMERTA
Peter Pettigrew

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Little lump of a boy Always
tagging after Black and

MADAM ROSMERTA
I remember him Whats he got to
do with it

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
After the Potters were killed
Pettigrew went looking for Black
And unfortunately found him

CORNELIUS FUDGE
Black was vicious He didnt kill
Pettigrew He destroyed him A
finger Thats all that was left
A finger -- theres your hearsay

Rosmerta looks to McGonagall She nods grimly

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sirius Black may not have put his
hands to the Potters but hes the
reason theyre dead And now he
wants to finish what he started

MADAM ROSMERTA
Harry

( ) 82
McGonagall nods then looks pained

CORNELIUS FUDGE
But thats not the worst of it

MADAM ROSMERTA
What could be worse

PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

-- drawing the cloak from Harry He stares into the

Harrys face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposite
Lupin ANCIENT CHARTS drape the walls while gleaming
SPHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently Lupin
paces before a LARGE TRUNK

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Youre sure about this Harry
This is very advanced magic Well
beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level

HARRY
If Black can fight the Dementors
I need to know how too

Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well The spell Im going to
teach you is called the Patronus
Charm Ever hear of it

Harry shakes his head

PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Patronus is a kind of positive
force For the wizard who can
conjure one the Patronus works
something like a shield The
Dementor feeds on it instead of
him

Just then the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY As Harrys eyes

wander Lupin SNAPS his fingers brings his attention
back

PROFESSOR LUPIN
But in order for it to work you
must think of a memory And not
just any This memory needs to be
a very happy one And powerful

Harry thinks a bit Then nods

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Got something Good Let it fill
you up Lose yourself in it
Then speak the incantation
Expecto Patronum Without your
wand

HARRY
Expecto Patronum

Harry nods raises his wand Lupin watching closely
reaches over grips the lid of the TRUNK

horrific

Harry studies the frog Takes a bite Begins to
recover

choose

Thats not good enough Harry
Not nearly

Harry glances toward the window at the bloody sun

HARRY
Theres another Its not happy

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Harry looks up into Lupins eyes Emotional Nods

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Then lets try it

Harry takes a breath Tosses the frog aside Poises
himself

PROFESSOR LUPIN

Lupin blinks at Harrys quiet fierceness Opens the
packing case Instantly the Dementor appears again A
chill fills the air The hair skates off Harrys scar
He sets his jaw

HARRY
Expecto Patronum

Harrys hand TREMBLES His whole BODY TREMBLES But he

holds his ground when -- WHOOSH -- a huge SILVER SHADOW
BURSTS from the end of his wand hovering between him and

PROFESSOR LUPIN
So you know Harry Youd have
given your father a run for his

Harry ponders this Then speaks deep inside himself

EXT BLACK LAKE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 97

Hagrid wearing a GIGANTIC HAIRY BROWN SUIT and perhaps
the worlds ugliest YELLOW AND ORANGE TIE stands knee-
deep in the shallows of the Black Lake skimming rocks as
big as flagstones across the waters shiny gloss As he
turns the trio catches a brief sight of his eyes red
with tears then he looks away

HERMIONE
Howd it go Hagrid
HAGRID
Buckbeak liked London
HERMIONE
I meant the hearing
HAGRID
Oh That Well I got up an

Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an

no teacher in their righ mind
would expose their students to

HERMIONE

And

Hagrid slings another rock into water

HERMIONE
You mustnt blame yourself
Hagrid

RON

HAGRID

Dark Ominous Dementors drift in the distance
Restless

INT TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT

Silent A room of shadows While those around him
slumber Harry lies awake unable to sleep Finally he
turns to his cupboard takes the Marauders Map
WHISPERS

HARRY
I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good

The crooked corridors and serpentine passageways of
Hogwarts radiate across the parchment then a TINY DOT
catches Harrys eye He frowns It reads Peter
Pettigrew

INT CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 100
Harry moves down a DARK corridor map in hand WAND
AGLOW In the PAINTINGS he passes the subjects SNORE
SOFTLY
INSERT - MARAUDERS MAP
Harry Potter and Peter Pettigrew draw closer and
closer
BACK TO SCENE
Harry squints toward the end of the corridor Down at
the map Pettigrew moves quickly down the adjoining

corridor Twenty yards away Ten Only seconds away

Wand trembling in his hand Harry glances from the map to

the dark corridor ahead again and again Then as the
two DOTS are about to collide he looks slowly up
turns the corner heart in his chest and meets
HIMSELF

reflected in a MIRROR He BLINKS startled then
glances back down at the map Pettigrew has moved past
him Confused Harry wheels casts his wand along the
walls

VOICE (0S)
Watch it there boy

Harry JUMPS But its only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING
scowling in the glare of Harrys wand light On the map
Pettigrew continues to move away Harry makes to
follow then stops HEARS FOOTSTEPS The WANDS SPOT
dances across the parchment finds another DOT
Approaching FAST “Severus Snape

HARRY
Mischief managed

Harry stashes the map extinguishes his wand and
turns into the harsh glare of Snapes wand

SNAPE
Potter Whatre you doing
wandering the corridors at night

HARRY
I was I was sleepwalking

A sneer curdles the corners of Snapes lips

( )

100

SNAPE
How extraordinarily like your
father you are Potter He too
was exceedingly arrogant
Strutting about the castle --

HARRY
My dad didn’t strut Nor do I
Now if you dont mind Id
appreciate you lowering your wand

Snape eyes Harry coldly Containing himself Lowers his
wand

SNAPE
Turn out your pockets

Harry doesnt move eyes still boring into Snape

SNAPE
Turn out your pockets

Finally Harry obliges Seeing the map Snapes eyes
glitter

SNAPE
And this What might it be

HARRY
Spare bit of parchment

SNAPE
Really
(poising his wand)
Reveal your secret

To Harrys horror words begin to appear Snape studies
him a sadistic half-smile on his lips Turns the map
his way

SNAPE
Read it

HARRY
Messrs Moony Wormtail Padfoot
and Prongs offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and’

SNAPE
Go on

( )

100 HARRY
and request that he keep his
abnormally large nose out of other
peoples business

SNAPE
(smile drooping)
Why you insolent little --

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Professor

Snape turns Sees Lupin standing in the shadows

SNAPE
Well well Lupin Out for a little
walk in the moonlight are we

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry You all right

SNAPE
That remains to be seen Ive
just now confiscated a rather
curious artifact from Mr Potter
Take a look Lupin This is
supposed to be your area of
expertise

Lupin takes the parchment which now displays a rather

unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions

SNAPE
Clearly its full of Dark Magic

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I seriously doubt that Severus
It looks to me as if it merely
insults anyone who tries to read
it I suspect its a Zonko
product Nevertheless I shall
pursue any hidden qualities it may
possess As you say its my area
of expertise Come Harry

101 INT CORRIDORLUPINS OFFICE - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER)

Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin who grips the map
fiercely

( )

PROFESSOR LUPIN
I dont know how this map came to
be in your possession Harry but
Im astounded that you didnt turn
it in Did you ever stop to think
that this -- in the hands of
Sirius Black -- is a map to you

Harry walks silently Lupin can barely contain his anger

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father didnt set much store
by rules either But he and your
mother did give their lives to
save yours Gambling their
sacrifice by walking about the
castle unprotected with a killer
on the loose strikes me as a poor
way to repay them I wont cover
up for you again Harry

Lupin enters his office tosses the map on his desk and

begins to

sort through some papers Harry lingers

briefly in the doorway absently eyes the WAXING MOON
that glimmers beyond the window then starts to turn
away Stops

HARRY
Professor Just so you know I
dont think the map always works
Earlier it showed someone in the
castle Someone I know to be dead

PROFESSOR LUPIN
(only half-listening)
And who was that Harry

HARRY
Peter Pettigrew

Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly then returns to his

papers

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well Id like you to return
to your dormitory now Oh and
Harry Dont take any detours

As Harry looks back Lupin taps the map

PROFESSOR LUPIN
If you do I1l1 know

INT DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING 102

The students gaze into CRYSTAL BALLS faces reflecting
the mist within so that their very skin seems to be made
of smoke

Conspicuously Harry Ron and Hermione sit apart

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Crystal-gazing requires that you
clear the Inner Eye Only then
will you See Oh my what do
we have here

As Trelawney eyes Harrys crystal Hermione rolls her
eyes

HERMIONE
Here we go again Its the Grim
Its the Grim

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
(eyes narrowing)

My dear from the moment you first
arrived in my class I sensed that
you did not possess the proper
spirit for the noble art of
Divination You may be young in
years but the heart that beats
beneath your bosom is as shriveled
as an old maids your soul as dry
as the pages of the books to which
you so desperately cleave

Stung Hermione starts to reply but -- remarkably --
seems incapable of a single word Rising gracelessly
she exits knocking her crystal ball to the floor Harry
watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the
doorway

will leave us forever You knew

watches him go along with the others then spies
Hermiones crystal ball lying on the landing
INT DIVINATION CLASSROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 102B
Harry sets Hermiones crystal back on its stand starts
to go when the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly
DARKENS Leaning close Harry watches the shape that
appears It is unmistakable Sirius Black Just then
a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and
- a HAND SNATCHES Harrys shoulder He wheels
finds
HARRY
Professor Trelawney --
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
He will return tonight
Harry stiffens Trelawneys voice is eerily HOLLOW
HARRY
S-sorry
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Tonight when the clock strikes
twelve the servant shall break
free He and his Master shall be
reunited It cannot be prevented
Trelawney smiles savagely then her head falls forward

When it rises she blinks eyes the hand that lies upon
Harrys shoulder Her hand

PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
So sorry dear boy Did you say
something

Her voice is normal once more Harry shakes his head

HARRY
No Nothing

Malfoy stumbles back against a tree cross-eyed with fear
as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose
when

RON
Hermione No

She turns surprised Rons spoken to her He looks away

RON
Hes not worth it

Hermione nods then -- SMACK -- quick as lightning
lands a looping right to Malfoys jaw putting him flat
on his back Stunned he leaps to his feet and runs
Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind

DING

The trio stops fighting their tears A QUARTET OF BLEAK
SHADOWS files from the hut One of the SHADOWS --
Dumbledore -- raises his hand and points directing the
attention of the others away from Buckbeak Dumbledore
speaks briefly -- unintelligible from this distance
then -- CAW CAW -- The crows SHRIEK excitedly and the
Executioner separates from the others disappears behind
a LOW STAND OF TREES

DING

All goes very still The wind loses its voice

DING

Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees
INTO VIEW

DING

The ax hangs seemingly forever etched against the sky
then drops from sight A SICKENING CHOP fouls the
breeze and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb

disbelief Hermione face turned away trembles

The SUN sets dropping behind the mountains in the

crows stain the bloody sky their PRIMAL SHRIEKING rising
like a curse
Slowly Hermiones hand falls onto Rons shoulder and
CAMERA FALLS WITH her CONTINUING DOWN the length of
Rons arm to his hand where a DROP OF BLOOD hangs from
his finger drops like a tear

Ron stares at his hand At the blood running down his
finger

shields himself when the dog LEAPS CLEAR OVER HIM
RON
Aaaahhh
The dogs TEETH flash and -- SNAP -- close on Rons

foot dragging him TOWARDS THE TRUNK like a rag doll
Instantly Harry dashes forward leaps out and grabs
Rons hands but he and Ron just keep skudding along
the ground

Hermione pitches herself onto Harrys feet and the
three of them go scudding along

RON

Harry raises his chin The dog vanishes into the GAP at
the base of the tree begins to pull Ron through

HARRY
Hold on Ron

But its no use The dog is too powerful Harry glances
around desperately then finds himself looking directly
in Rons eyes He can read his mind

HARRY
No Ron

One by one Ron releases his fingers from Harrys
forearm Sacrificing himself

HARRY
Nooooo

But Ron closes his eyes releases his hands fully and

Harry into the air and -- FLOOMPH -- drops them on their
backsides

Swaying beautifully against the dusky sky swishing
softly

BACK TO SCENE

As one they rise Run back toward the gap in the tree
A branch swoops down

Hermione ducks Harry doesnt WHOOSH -- he is flung
one way his GLASSES the other

Hermione HOPS over another branch -- looks briefly
pleased with herself -- only to find herself SWEPT HIGH
IN THE AIR by a second branch She looks down sees
Harry searching the ground for his glasses

HERMIONE

Harry squints up sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST of a branch
screaming straight down for his head He rolls away just
as -- WHOMP -- the branch PULVERIZES the ground

Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME still clinging on for dear
life and Harry rises FLUMPH -- hes promptly knocked
to the ground again Hermione goes CRASHING through the
high branches Harry spies his glasses and grabs them
Rising he fits them to his face and

turns CRYSTAL CLEAR just in time to see Hermione
FLYING MADLY TOWARD HIM

Then abruptly the tunnel ends Confused Harry and
Hermione glance about then -- as one -- peer up A

Harry looks down follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to

the MAN standing in the shadows Filthy matted hair
hangs to his shoulders His skin like a corpse

He studies Harrys face keenly Harry draws his wand

HERMIONE
If you want to kill Harry youll

SIRIUS BLACK
No Only one will die tonight

HARRY
Then itll be you

the madness within

SIRIUS BLACK
Youd know all about the madness
within wouldnt you Remus

The two regard each other the moment taut with tension
then Lupin steps forward and EMBRACES Black like a
brother

HERMIONE
No I trusted you I covered up
for you And all this time youve
been his friend
(pointing)
Hes a werewolf Thats why hes
been missing classes

Harry and Ron stare dumbfounded at Lupin Black HOWLS
then bitterly amused Lupin eyes him then turns back

PROFESSOR LUPIN
How long have you known

Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and with a flick
of his own disarms him Furious Harry eyes Black
murderously

HARRY
You betrayed my parents You sold
them to Voldemort

SIRIUS BLACK
Its a lie I never wouldve
betrayed James and Lily

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry Youve got to listen --

HARRY
Did he listen When my mother was
dying Did he hear her screaming

SIRIUS BLACK
No I wasnt there And Ill

Harrys eyes flash to Blacks glittering with pain

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Someone else betrayed your
parents Harry Someone in this
room right now Someone who
until quite recently I believed
to be dead

SIRIUS BLACK
Hes as good as dead

HARRY
Whatre you talking about
Theres nobody here

Oh yes there is

Black turns then to Ron and CROONS in a cruel sing
song

SIRIUS BLACK
Come out come out Peter
Come out come out and play

Ron draws back from Blacks demented gaze

RON
Youre mad

Harrys eyes shift from Rons FACE to his HANDS where
Scabbers TWISTS violently As a curious expression
befalls Harry Lupin and Black as one raise their
wands when

Snape standing in the doorway smiling smugly

Do I detect a flicker of fear
One can only imagine what it must
be like to endure the Dementors
Kiss Its said to be unbearable
to witness But Ill do my best

Snapes eyes harden He gestures to the door

SNAPE

As the others start to go Harry glances at the table
where Lupin has left Harrys wand In a flash its in
his hand

HARRY

Snape soars into the air hits the wall with a THUD and
slides down Ron and Hermione stare in shock

Harry stares into Blacks sunken eyes Wanting to
believe Desperate to believe Glances at Ron his
agonized face Scabbers SQUIRMS VIOLENTLY

HARRY
Show me

Lupin and Black turn to Ron He holds Scabbers
protectively

RON
What are you going to do to him

Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance

SIRIUS BLACK
Together

With that Lupin takes out his wand and as one he and
Black cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT Scabbers twists
madly in midair then -- FLASH -- transforms into a
very short man with thinning hair and grubby hands

Neither speaks Pettigrews small watery eyes dart
toward the windows and door Suddenly he makes a
break for it but Sirius merely shoves him back
Pettigrews nose twitches his gaze finding Harry His
hands flutter nervously reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER

PETTIGREW

directly into Pettigrews face He shrinks back
trembling closing his eyes in fear when

A HOWL PIERCES THE AIR and Harry wheels With a shrug
Lupin tosses Black into the air then turns He is no

to edge back

HERMIONE
Professor

The WEREWOLFS eyes blaze Long teeth glitter Then
a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat Harry and
Hermione spin begin to flee and run flat into Snape
As they collapse in a great clumsy pile Snapes eyes
flutter open the spell broken Seeing Hermione atop
him he sweeps her aside

SNAPE
Out of the way

and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce Leaping
to his feet Snape draws his wand and steps forward
shielding Hermione Harry and Ron

The WEREWOLF HOWLS SPRINTS forward when -- SWOOSH -- a
GIANT DOG (Black) intercepts it in MIDAIR They hit the
ground in a FIERCE TANGLE of FLASHING TEETH a single
horrible flailing beast Again and again the dog pushes
the werewolf back but the werewolf is too strong

HARRY
Sirius

The DOG YELPS ROARS in pain and the werewolf flings it
into the tall grass As it charges after Harry pushes
past Snape dashes into the night Hermione makes to
follow but Snape holds her back

razor-sharp claws suspended over its neck

Desperately Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground
and hurls it with all his might Bulls-eye The
werewolf freezes Turns Begins to move toward
Harry

Harry draws his wand terrified but tormented as well
knowing Lupin dwells somewhere within the beast

HARRY
Please Professor Stop Its

Suddenly a HOWL pierces the night

The werewolf falters cocking its head toward the forest
Harry waits petrified The WEREWOLFs eyes shift back
to him It SNARLS moves closer ready to kill Harry
covers his face with his arm when

a SECOND HOWL ECHOES high above the forest Slowly
Harry drops his arm Looks The werewolf bounds toward
the forest vanishes Harrys eyes shift In the
darkness the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass
Falls Rises Falls again Each time becoming more

his hair CHILL-BUMPS pebble his SKIN A FRINGE of ICE
appears at the lakes edge Then they appear oozing

like smoke through the TREES across the lake Dementors

HARRY
No No

Expecto Patronum

A thin silvery wisp weeps from Harrys wand hovering
like a VEIL but the Dementors continue to come Harry
places his hand on Blacks HEAVING HEART poises his wand
once more

HARRY
Expecto Patronum

Harrys Patronus blooms briefly and dies Harrys
eyes flutter the DEMENTORS twisting madly in his vision
drawing closer Black GASPS SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT
tumble from his lips as if his very soul were leaving
him

Then a LIGHT splinters the trees Harry squints sees
a FIERY STAG appear its body luminous slashing
through the trees sowing light in the darkness The
Dementors wilt in its wake but more replace them
sweeping down in waves Still the stag charges on The
LIGHT EXPANDS The forest blazing with it The remaining
Dementors flee drifting across the moon like ash

The light ebbs The stags luminous body flickers
There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns a single
THREAD of LIGHT all that remains spinning down to the

size of a PEARL in the palm of MAN standing deep in
the trees Harry studies the strangely familiar
SILHOUETTE then it is gone

DUMBLEDORE

to say the word of three thirteen-
year-old wizards will convince few

honest and true is meaningless to
those who have forgotten how to
listen

As Dumbledore turns to the window a SHOOTING STAR
plummets silently through the sky

DUMBLEDORE
Ah a shooting star If ever
one was to make a wish now would
be the time But time Im

On cue the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME DING

You know the laws Miss Granger
You must not be seen And you

well the consequences are really
too ghastly to discuss Three

Dumbledore hands Harry and Hermione each a stick of

RON
What in bloody hell was all that
about

But Hermione doesn’t reply instead looping the pendants

Just then on the ground beside her Hermione notices

a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE Instantly she grabs it

Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin
pile where only seconds before they were hiding As
Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before
Hermione ponders the back of her own head

stirs the branches then peeks out and sees herself
staring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY Next

Lupin smiles wanly lifts his sorry suitcase Then
stops

PROFESSOR LUPIN
There are stories about him and your mother you know
Some are even true But I think its safe to say in the
end youll know them best by getting to know yourself
Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand

trailed by the others exits with the Firebolt As he
strides off others join the assembly -- Hagrid Malfoy
Crabbe and Goyle among them -- curious to see what the
commotion is all about

EXT COURTYARD - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 151
As Harry stops an expectant HUSH hangs over the moment

SEAMUS
Go on Harry

NEVILLE

Harry mounts the broom Licks his finger and jabs it in
the air A few others do the same Hagrid does the
same Crabbe and Goyle start to do the same when Malfoy
SLAPS their hands down Finally Harry places his hand
on the broom Sets his grip Takes a breath And

Frowns

FREDGEORGE

HARRY

A collective GROAN Dejected many of the kids begin to
drift toward the castle Harry calls after

HARRY
Oh come on now Its just a
broom

HAGRID

Just a broom

Harrys eye shifts to Ron and Hermione A wink

HARRY
The fastest broom in the world

As everyone turns -- WHOOSH -- Harry JETS OFF and we --

A tiny DOT GROWING LARGER AND LARGER races upward

Its Harry shooting straight into the blue on the

Firebolt A SCREAM GROWS LOUDER as he approaches A

scream of release of utter abandon Its Harry

screaming But something else is clear as he JETS PAST
and

The SCREEN GOES BLACK

Its a SCREAM of joy

FADE OUT
