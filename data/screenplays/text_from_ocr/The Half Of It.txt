BLACK

ANIMATION SEQUENCE (NOTE STILL TRYING STUFF ) 1

Love is simply the name for the desire and pursuit of
the whole - Plato The Symposium

A BLANK SHEET OF PARCHMENT

ELLIE (VO)
The Ancient Greeks believed humans
once had four arms four legs and
a single head made of two faces

GRAVEL emerges from the center of the page and “crushes” into
BLACK POWDER which forms the base for CHARCOAL STROKES
Animated STROKES illustrate a TWIN-BEING

ELLIE (VO)
We were happy Complete

A CHARCOAL HEART encircles the twin-being Both faces smile

ELLIE (V0O)
So complete that the gods - fearing
our wholeness would quell our need
for worship - cleaved us in two

The page TEARS in half the Twin-Being is SPLIT
ELLIE (VO)

-leaving our split-selves to

wander the earth in misery forever

longing
ZOOM IN on one of the halves as it wanders the earth CRYING
The strokes of its body morph into a lonely CAVE PAINTING
FIGURE also crying

ELLIE (VO)
longing

Morph into the “Mona Lisa”crying “The Scream” crying

ELLIE (VO)
longing

Morph into a classic black and white movie with a closeup of
an actress you guessed it crying

THE HALF OF IT - SHOOTING SCRIPT ELLIE (VO)
--for the other half of our soul

From cave paintings to Ingrid Bergman So many tears
ELLIE (V0O)
It is said that when one half finds
its other
Pull out to reveal the reverse shot to that classic movie
Lover’s eyes meet Each reverts back to their split-being

ELLIE (V0O)
there is an unspoken
understanding a unity - and each
would know no greater joy than

this
A classic KISS Music SWELLS as the charcoal halves converge

into a BIG ANIMATED CHARCOAL HEART
MATCH DISSOLVE TO

INT SQUAHAMISH HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKERS - MORNING

A CRAPPY GRAFFITI HEART on a high school wall

linger on a PHOTO OF HER MOTHER young laughing striking

ELLIE (VO)

More evidence of Camus’ theory that

life is irrational and meaningless
- A PRINTER spits out a page on which is written
“Camus’ theory that life is irrational and meaningless”
A HAND grabs the page signing “Trig Carson AP English”
CUT to ANOTHER PAPER On its last page
“We don’t need the gods to mess things up for us”
The hand signs - in new penmanship - “Todd Ball English”

Papers are tossed onto a stack

ASTER
Forgive me father for I have
sinned It’s been 48 days since my
last confession I had feelings for
someone who wasn’t my boyfriend I
didn’t tell you Or God Or my
boyfriend I kept it for myself I
was selfish And maybe love is
selfish It’s having this secret
stashed in you until one day it
feels like someone else has that
same secret and suddenly this thing
you didn’t even know you held feels
full and amazing and real But it
turns out to be a lie And you’re
left lonelier than ever So I’11 do
whatever Hail Mary’s you deem fit
But whatever punishment you give
me it can’t be worse than this
feeling Because even now he’s
the only one I want to talk to And
it’s like he doesn’t even exist
