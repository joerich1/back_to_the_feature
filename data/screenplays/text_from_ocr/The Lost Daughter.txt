INTEXT LEDA’S CAR RED FLAG ROAD - NIGHT 1

An elegant woman LEDA 40s drives on a two lane sea-side
road Sand dunes and the sea are lit by the moon and the
car’s headlights She sweats Her breathing is short and
sharp We hear the sounds of her breath over the motor

Suddenly the headlights begin to dim the sound shifts and
LEDA LIFTS SOFTLY OUT OF HER SEAT as if there were no longer
any gravity She has to tuck her head at a funny angle to see

out the windshield She keeps a hold of the steering wheel
to keep from floating away but otherwise seems unperturbed

EXT LEDA’S CAR RED FLAG ROAD - NIGHT 2

The car has careened into the guardrail off the small road A
minor crash

Leda emerges from the car She looks around dazed and makes
her way toward the water

CONTINUOUS

EXT RED FLAG BEACH - NIGHT 3
Leda continues toward the water in the moonlight A RED
LIFEGUARD FLAG flaps in the dark but the sea is totally flat
and calm

Leda studies the warning flag then walks cautiously toward
the water

She dips her foot in with her sandal on The leather soaks in
the salty water

She puts her other foot into the water

Then SHE COLLAPSES ON THE BEACH

INTEXT LEDA’S CAR ISLAND ROAD - DAY 4

Leda looking healthy and vibrant drives sunglasses on the
windows open Her car packed with suitcases and books She
lets her hair whip in the wind
INTEXT LEDA’S CARSEASIDE APARTMENT - EVENING 5

Leda pulls into a small seaside town Cottages are packed
together along the coastline She checks the address and
parks

Lyle (late 60s) thin and strong with thick white hair is
waiting for her He speaks to her through her window as she
pulls up

LYLE
Ms Caruso

LEDA
Yes Leda

LYLE

Hi yeah welcome Was the drive

backed up on The National Road
after Corinth That can be a tough
one

LEDA
No no it was fine Have you been
waiting long

LYLE
It’s alright

LEDA
I got a late start

He moves to the trunk and starts to take her suitcases and
books out She moves to help him

LYLE
No no let me

He says it with a kind of desperation and she lets him She
stops to look around smell the sea air
EXT SEASIDE APARTMENT STAIRS - DUSK 6

Lyle lugs Leda’s heavy suitcases up four flights She
follows

LEDA
Sorry Those are half filled with
books
LYLE
(winded)
Yeah

LEDA
Is this your place

LYLE
No I take care of it For 30 years
now

LEDA
Oh wow

LYLE

And a few other places in the
dunes The real big ones

She walks behind him as he struggles up the stairs

INT SEASIDE APARTMENT HALLWAY BEDROOM - NIGHT 7

Lyle unlocks the door and puts down two big suitcases
panting and sweating a little

LYLE
Please make yourself at home I’11l
be back with the rest

Leda moves around the small apartment A bedroom A small
windowless kitchen that opens directly into the bathroom A
living room with a picture window that opens onto a terrace

A big tray of peaches plums grapes pears figs has been
left on the table It shines like a still life

Suddenly there is THE SOUND OF SMALL CHILDREN coming from
another room Leda follows it through the dark apartment to a
bedroom

MEMORY

Bianca 5 and Martha 3 sit curled in a corner by the bedside
table They are barely visible in the dark Martha has gotten

gum in her hair she cries

BIANCA

Martha wails
BIANCA (CONT’D)
I’m sorry but you do You shouldn’t
give her gum mama even in the
car

MARTHA
(crying desperately
unhappy )
No no no no mama no no

BIANCA
Yes mama she does have to cut it
now or the whole head will get
sticky

A big FLASH OF LIGHT illuminates the room And we

CUT BACK TO

INT SEASIDE APARTMENT BEDROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT 8

Leda moves to the bedroom window to investigate the flash
It’s from A LIGHTHOUSE IN THE DISTANCE

LYLE
(from the other room)
Ok that about does it

Lyle brings another heavy suitcase into the apartment He is
really sweating now He tries to catch his breath as he
talks

He moves around the apartment turning on lights He turns on
a ceiling fan still struggling to catch his breath

LYLE (CONT’D)
There’s a remote for this
somewhere And I’1l1 turn the air
on in the bedroom

LEDA
No no that’s fine

LYLE

It’s no problem And you’re gonna
want to see how it works It’s got
a mind of its own

He moves into the bedroom

LEDA
No I prefer the fresh air

He turns it on anyway as if he hasn’t heard her Then he
moves back out of the bedroom He checks that the fridge is
on and working

LYLE
Your breakfast is covered at the
bar downstairs

LEDA
Breakfast in a bar

They stand awkwardly for a moment The lighthouse flashes its
light

LYLE
The lighthouse It’s not all the
time Are youyou write books
Orare you a teacher

LEDA
I’m a professor Let me get you a
tip
She goes for her purse
LYLE
No please
(He seems almost
offended)
Welcome to Kyopeli
INT SEASIDE APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT 9

Leda turns off the AC pushes back the curtains and opens the
window She takes a breath of fresh sea air

She turns off the lights and lays on the bed in her clothes
THE BEAM OF THE LIGHTHOUSE EXPLODES OUT OF THE DARKNESS
Filling the room with light

INT SEASIDE APARTMENT BEDROOM - MORNING 10
Leda wakes slowly She has covered her head with two pillows
to avoid the beam from the lighthouse

EXT PINEWOOD PATH - DAY 11
Leda in an elegant hat and simple sundress walks down a beach

path She holds a big beach bag filled with many books a
towel etc

Pine trees line the path and she has to walk carefully in her
sandals to avoid tripping over their slippery roots

EXT BEACH - DAY 12

The forest path opens out onto the beach There’s a slatted
wooden walkway that ends in an OLD FASHIONED PUBLIC BEACH
HOUSE with a worn cafe and umbrellas and lounge chairs lining
the shore

The beach is almost empty

There’s A YOUNG BEACH ATTENDANT who looks up from a big
textbook as Leda emerges from the woods

EXT BEACH - MORNING 13

Leda luxuriates in the calm clear water

EXT BEACH - AFTERNOON 14

Leda holds a pencil as she reads in her lounge chair
notebooks and books spread out around her She is deeply
concentrated

The young beach attendant WILL approaches her He is
lean and darkly handsome very boyish

WILL
Do you need some help Ma’am

Leda surprised by the interruption just looks at him for a
moment

WILL (CONT’D)
Youre in the sun I could help you
move your chair

LEDA
Oh yes I am in the sun

WILL
Can I move your chair under the
umbrella I work at the beach
house

It’s an odd offer She studies him

LEDA
Sure

She gets up and watches him as he shifts her lounge chair
under the umbrella and into shade

LEDA (CONT’D)
Thank you

WILL
So just let me know if you need
anything else I’m Will There’s a
Nespressoand ice pops

LEDA
Ok great Will Thanks

He turns to go She watches him for a beat

LEDA (CONTD)
(calling after him)
What kind of ice pops

EXT BEACH - DAY 15

Leda licks her cornetto ice cream cone in the sun it drips
down its shiny paper wrapper

Suddenly A HUGE FAMILY GROUP arrives at the beach A man in
his 60s with a big belly wears his shirt open over his
swimming trunks and carries a cooler on his shoulder A group
of young kids hit and grab at each other screaming as they
move in and out of the water A woman CALLIE around 40
with a big pregnant belly spilling out of her bright bikini
in all directions busies herself setting up beach blankets
and walking back and forth from the beach shack with ice-
creams and bottles of water for the many kids There is a
pack of teenage ROUGH BOYS rowdy dangerous There are
grandparents

They are loud calling out to each other across the beach
arguing joking Top 40 music comes from somewhere

WILL the beach attendant immediately jumps to attention and
bustles around setting up chairs and opening umbrellas
People call to him from all directions

After a moment Leda catches Will’s eye She smiles and gives
him a wave

EXT BEACH - AFTERNOON 16

The sun is going down The beach is still crowded with the
big extended family

Leda is deep in her work Finally she stretches and looks up
from her books to see

A young woman NINA and her daughter ELENA walking
hand in hand out of the water TALKING TO EACH OTHER
PEACEFULLY AS IF ONLY THEY EXISTED ELENA holds A WET PLASTIC
DOLL tightly to her chest They settle on their blanket

The woman is slim and elegant in a tasteful bathing suit
The little girl quiet and a little sad They are a part of
the big noisy family but they seem like another species

CALLIE
(calling from across the
beach)
NINA NINA SHE’S GOT A COLD PUT
SOMETHING AROUND HER IF YOU’RE
GONNA LET HER SWIM THIS LATE

Callie breasts bouncing comes running over with a hot pink
terrycloth robe and wraps it around the little girl NINA
lets her

Leda takes out her pen and writes “NINA” in small letters in
the margin of her book

INT SEASIDE APARTMENT HALLWAY KITCHEN - NIGHT 17

Leda in a towel wet from the shower wanders into her
kitchen She opens the refrigerator It’s empty

She takes a plum from the beautiful fruit bowl As she
brings it to her lips she sees that the underside is bruised
and rotten

She picks up a pear its underside is also moldy and rotten
She picks up a bunch of grapes by their stem and exposes A
MESS OF ROT AND MOLD under the pristine surface All of the
fruit is half rotten

She dumps the fruit basket into the garbage

EXT BEACH - DAY 18

Leda in a different bathing suit settles at the same beach
chair from the day before She lays down her bag of books
and looks for Nina the young mother and Elena her daughter

She finds them sitting under an umbrella Nina rubs suntan
lotion on Elena’s body with notable tenderness Massaging the
cream into the little girl’s skin Playfully squeezing the
tips of each finger

Nina and Elena move to THE DOLL who lies next to them on
their blanket They talk to her as they lovingly cover her
with lotion

ELENA
Squeeze Neni’s fingers too She
likes it

Nina massages the tips of THE DOLL’S fingers

ELENA (CONT’D)
I’m hungry

Elena suddenly gets up and runs to the beach house cafe

EXT BEACH CAFE - MIDDAY 19

Leda finishes a coffee at the cafe She watches Nina and
Elena as they play in the sand by the cafe undressing THE
DOLL and carefully bathing her in a green plastic bucket

Two YOUNG MEN (20s) approach Nina and start to talk her up
She’s quiet and enjoys the attention

A few of the ROUGH BOYS from the family group (late
teens20s) immediately intervene rudely

After a few words the Rough Boys shove the YOUNG MEN almost
starting a fistfight until the young men move off down the
beach

Leda notices Will watching too

EXT BEACH - AFTERNOON 20

Nina and Elena have dragged their lounge chairs closer to the
water Nina lies on her stomach in the sun And in the other
chair lies THE DOLL also on her stomach same position as
Nina

Elena is at the water’s edge filling a plastic watering can
to the brim She holds it with both hands and totters under
its weight as she returns to the lounge chairs to sprinkle
her mother’s feet with water When she finishes she moves on
to the Doll’s feet

ELENA
Is that enough Mama Want more

NINA
Yes please I want a lot more

ELENA
Want more Neni
NINA
(in a high pitched tone
voicing the doll)
Oh yes please Elena It’s so very
very hot today
Elena moves up her mother’s body with the water dousing her
legs her hips back Then she moves to the Doll’s legs then
hips then back

Leda watches rapt

Suddenly Leda gets up and moves quickly to the cafe

EXT BEACH CAFE -— AFTERNOON 21

Leda steadies herself on the bar

LEDA
Will I’d love a glass of water

EXT DIFFERENT BEACHMEMORY — DAY 22

MEMORY

A YOUNG VERSION OF LEDA sits with her daughters Martha and Bianca all in bikinis She peels an orange all
in one long piece

YOUNG LEDA
Smell

The girls smell it delighted

BIANCA AND MARTHA
(talking over each other)
Peel it like a snake Don’t let it
break

Young Leda laughs and continues to peel the orange in one
long piece without letting the peel break

YOUNG LEDA
You know why they call it a navel
orange Do you know another word
for navel

They don’t

YOUNG LEDA (CONT’D)
Belly button See doesn’t it look
like a belly button

The girls look at the orange’s “navel” Then all three of
them look at their own belly buttons

CUT BACK TO

EXT BEACH CAFE -— AFTERNOON 23
Will brings Leda a glass of water

She dips her fingers in it and wets her forehead she puts
the cool glass to her cheek

INT SEASIDE APARTMENT LIVING ROOM TERRACE - AFTERNOON 24

Leda bursts through the door her cell phone ringing Her
hands are full beach bag towel keys and her feet are
sandy She drops everything as she searches for her ringing
phone

LEDA
Martha Hello baby I was just
thinking about calling you I just
got back from the beach--

Leda wipes off her sandy feet as she listens to her daughter
We can faintly hear Martha through the phone she is clearly
upset

LEDA (CONTD)
Ruined what baby

She listens taking off her shoes wiping sand from her feet

LEDA (CONTD)
Why did you go to someone you
didn’t knowYour hair isn’t
awful It just gets very dry when
you dye it so much

While Martha is talking Leda pulls a chair out onto the and
sits

LEDA (CONTD)
Sometimes I’ve put a tablespoon of
olive oil--Ok Maybe your Dad
knows someone you can--

Leda listens to her daughter but closes her eyes

INT YOUNG LEDAS APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 25
MEMORY

Martha is in the bath crying her hair is covered in shampoo
and she’s gotten some in her eyes

Young Leda is frustrated she can’t find a towel She pulls
her shirt off and dips it into the water she uses it to try
to get the soap out of Martha’s eyes
YOUNG LEDA
(her hands on Martha’s
little face)
Ok blink blink blink

Martha does She looks in her mother’s eyes she stops
crying

CUT BACK TO

EXT SEASIDE APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 26

Leda opens her eyes Still on the phone with Martha

LEDA
I love you too baby I’m on
vacation--oh ok I love you too

Leda hangs up and looks out over her

EXT BEACH - DAY 27

Leda is swimming She hears a loud honking She raises her
head out of the water to find a large MOTOR BOAT moving
quickly towards her She startles and swims out of its way

The boat honking playing music continues over a line of
red buoys startling an old man swimming laps

From the water Leda sees Callie on the shore running towards
Nina

CALLIE
(off screen)
NINA NINA NINA

Nina picks up Elena and points at the boat with exaggerated
cheerfulness

The boat then passes a line of white buoys where small
children are swimming A mother rushes in to move them out of
the way

On the shore the big family group shout and wave their hands
at the boat in greeting

Finally the boat stops almost at the shore and a big group
of heavy men ostentatiously rich women obese children pile
out and onto the beach to greet the big family

Leda turns to see a heavy thickset man shaved head early
40s standing at the helm of the boat He wears a black tee
shirt that stretches over his belly and swim trunks This is
NINA’S HUSBAND TONI (40s)

In no hurry Toni steps out of the boat to meet Nina who
waits at the shore He is followed by an entourage of other
large jovial men carrying coolers backpacks and some
wrapped presents

Toni takes Elena from Nina The little girl hugs him and
gives his cheek small anxious kisses

He seizes Nina by the neck almost forcing her to bend over
and abruptly touches her lips to his It’s a little violent
and also sexy

The big family group erupts into a kind of party Opening
presents Nina tries on a BIG STRAW HAT

Nina’s hat is carried off by the wind Her husband grabs it
in one decisive motion like an animal Elena still in his
arms

Leda watches from the water

EXT BEACH - LATER 28

Leda struggles to read surrounded by the large family crowd
Their music is blaring they are calling loudly to one
another laughing drinking

She looks up from her work to find that a family with 3 small
children sitting near her are packing up their gear towels
shovels beach bags hats and moving down the beach

Callie is talking animatedly to another couple who also pick
up their things irritated and move down the beach to
another umbrella Members of the big family take over their
chairs and umbrellas as they go

The Pregnant Lady has enlisted Will to help They start to
move in Leda’s direction

CALLIE
This lady also has to move
(rushing over to Leda’s
chair)

WILL
I’m sorry to bother you--

CALLIE
Right You don’t mind moving

A pause Leda closes her book

LEDA
No I’m fine here

CALLIE
It’s just about switching
umbrellas So my family can be
together

Leda takes off her sunglasses looks Callie in the eye

LEDA
I understand but I have no desire
to move

An old man VASILI and a few of the rough boys from the
family come over

CALLIE
Really This is--

VASILI
(smiling)
Oh what’s it to you right You do

LEDA

Leda goes back to her book

the beach a few feet--
NINA’S HUSBAND

AN UNNERVING CALM)

Leda continues to read but she is flushed and angry

EXT PINEWOOD PATH -— EVENING 30

Leda walks down the beach path toward the parking lot Pine
trees on both sides

There’s a creaking behind her A footstep
She stops and turns Silence

Leda keeps walking Suddenly she is hit by a VIOLENT BLOW to
the back She calls out in pain and surprise

She turns again breathless There’s no one behind her Only
a PINECONE rolling into the undergrowth

She picks it up She looks up to the tops of the pine trees
blowing in the wind for the source of the blow

INT SEASIDE APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 31
Leda takes off her shirt and examines her back in the mirror
There is a BIG SWOLLEN RED WELT between her shoulder
blades She tries to reach it with her fingers

EXT SEASIDE TOWN BOARDWALK - NIGHT 32
Leda is cleaned up and beautifully dressed for dinner She
walks along the boardwalk checking out the cafes It’s quiet

ghostly

Suddenly she stops and puts her hands on her knees like
she’s dizzy or she might throw up

She stands still like that in the empty street

INT SEASIDE BARCAFE

bites

Suddenly she gets up and walks to Lyle and his friends She
leans over him looking at his cards her breasts almost
brushing his neck

He turns to look at her shocked almost grateful for the
attention She looks loose and a little wild

LEDA (CONT’D)

INT SEASIDE APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT 34

Leda tosses and turns in bed There is a muted flash of light
from the lighthouse through the closed curtains

There is a faint clicking sound

Leda turns over and her hand touches something on the pillow
next to her She startles

She turns on the bedside light and finds a CICADA 4 inches
long sitting on the pillow It is hurt with a yellow ooze
coming out of its abdomen

Leda touches it with the sleeve of her nightgown It moves a
little and immediately stops its clicking

Leda gets out of bed picks up the pillow and tosses the
insect out the window

There is a yellow stain left on the pillow case

EXT BEACH - MIDDAY 35
Leda wearing dark glasses looks for Nina and Elena

She finds NINA AND HER HUSBAND ARGUING BY THE SHORE

Her husband has a hairy chest and wears a cross with a gold
chain He has a deep scar dissecting his protruding belly

that runs from the top of his bathing suit to his ribs

Nina gestures angrily at the family group on the beach Her
husband laughs

She takes his hat from the towel at their feet and throws it
towards the shore violently It falls like a feather
lightly into the water He walks calmly and picks it up
LEDA LOOKS AROUND FOR ELENA

She finds the child under a nearby umbrella in the sand
playing with her doll She wears her mother’s new straw hat

LEDA GETS UP AND MOVES HER BEACH CHAIR A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE
LITTLE GIRL Closer than she’s ever been

Up close THE DOLL is mangy half bald She has ballpoint pen
marks all over her body Leda notices that Elena’s nose is
red and runny
ELENA

Nannella
Elena kisses the doll hard on the face

FANTASY The doll’s head begins to inflate like a balloon
from the force of each kiss

Elena kisses the doll’s bare breast her back her stomach
with her mouth open almost like she wants to eat her

Leda watches

The child catches Leda looking She smiles and presses the
doll between her knees

LEDA DISCONCERTED GETS UP TO GO FOR A SWIM

On her way to the water she sees Nina walk off down the
beach Up close she notices that Nina has an ugly tramp
stamp tattoo on the small of her back and one on her ankle
Her bikini wax is coming in sweat beads on her forehead
Leda’s husband wades into the water to stand with a group of
men talking drinking beer out of plastic cups

EXT BEACH - AFTERNOON 36

Leda wakes from a nap sweating in the bright sun The welt
on her back is sore

The first thing she sees is Nina SOMETHING IS HAPPENING TO

head to one side to the other mechanically Then she runs
to her husband
Her husband jumps to his feet looks around
Soon the whole family is looking around

she didn’t share it That she
hadin creating meshe had
separated herself from melike
pushing a plate away from you when
the food is repulsive I’m drunk

She pushes away her wine glass

LEDA (CONT’D)

mean aS soon as you’re born it’s

separation And anyway what’s most
interesting are the secret
resemblances What makes Bianca
seductive and Martha not or vice
versa Well they blame me

Leda waits for Will to respond but he doesn’t say anything

Likewhen I was young I had large
breasts After I gave birth no
Bianca has large breasts And
Martha has almost none like a boy
She doesn’t know how beautiful she
is She wears a padded bra and it
humiliates her She thinks I gave
the best of myself to Bianca She
feels deprived I understand And
actually I even thought only half
seriously about implants at one
point Butthey come from
nowhereso what are they worth
And Bianca Bianca is so different
She doesn’t let herself feel
deprived She wants to suck
everything out of me all my secret
skills She’s the one
whorevealed to me that I’m
finicky about peeling fruit I like
it when the peel doesn’t break

Leda stops walking and looks around her The sun has started
to come out and people are returning to the beach

She turns back the way she came stretching her ankles
She’s walked a long way

Up ahead she sees a group of kids Nina’s family from the
beach DISTRIBUTING FLYERS TO THE BATHERS They each hold a
sizable packet of them They’re making a feverish game out of
handing them out

As Leda approaches all the children rush to her offering
flyers One of the children recognizes her

CHILD
(to his friend)
Don’t give her one

CHILD 2
Why

But the children offer their flyers anyway She takes one
The children bound off down the beach

At the center of THE FLYER is an ugly photograph of Elena
with her doll In big bold letters is a cell phone number

And a few lines offering a reward and saying the child is
“grieved by her loss”

Leda carefully folds the flyer and puts it into her purse
next to the doll’s new dress

EXT SEASIDE APARTMENT STAIRS - DAY 80

She starts to get frantic
Then she opens another top cabinet THE DOLL IS INSIDE

Leda sits on the terrace with THE DOLL She uses a cloth
and a bottle of rubbing alcohol to clean the pen marks off

She covers her mouth Shocked at hearing her voice talk to
the doll

Suddenly the sound of a door BUZZER is deafening Leda

fish
He laughs

He sees Young Leda she waves but he doesn’t acknowledge
her

Suddenly the room quiets as PROFESSOR HARDY (late 40s) walks
onto the stage A few people applaud

He begins A skilled speaker using the written text as a
guide then improvising

PROFESSOR HARDY
(low into the mic)
Bourdieus mistake was that he
often forgot the first part of his
own name

The room erupts in laughter

PROFESSOR HARDY (CONTD)
Sorry Walter I couldn’t help
myselfBut what I really want to
consider and I promise I’1l bring
this back to Auden is that which
is not only ineffable but unthought
in our paradigm

Young Leda watches him The sound shifts and his voice goes
into deep background Young Leda studies the faces in the
room laughing rapt

PROFESSOR HARDY (CONT’D)
I’ve been really turned on by
Ricoeur’s recent work on linguistic
hospitality and hawhat about
his name Ricoeur Let’s really
lean into that second syllable
because he is coming from the
heart

Then she focuses again on Professor Hardy Studies his face

“Translation sets us not only
intellectual work theoretical or
practical but also an ethical

He pulls her skirt up her coat still on and
hand inside her underwear

PROFESSOR HARDY (CONT’D)
In her astonishing piece on Auden’s
The Crisis Leda Caruso seems to me
to have anticipated Ricoeur in this
recent thinking on linguistic

“hospitality” comes in holding
one’s attention even in crisis As
Simone Weil says “attention is the
rarest and purest form of
generosity”

Nina looks scared

LEDA
I was just playing

NINA
But what playingWe were all
messed up You saw us

LEDA
I’m an unnatural mother

Leda starts to cry

NINA
Oh fuck

LEDA
I’m sorry

NINA

This isfucked

Nina grabs the doll

She starts to go leaving the keys and her hat and hatpin on
the table

LEDA
Oh take the keys Nina I’m leaving
tonight The apartment will be
empty till the end of the month

NINA
I don’t want anything from you

LEDA
OkI’m sorry You’re so
youngNo It doesn’t pass None
of it passes

NINA
(suddenly hissing
furious)
You are a fucking sick cunt You
better watch your back bitch
Leda gasps

She looks down to see THE END OF THE HAT PIN STICKING OUT OF
HER SKIN above her stomach just under her ribs

NINA (CONT’D)
You are one crazy ass bitch

Nina pulls the pin out throws it on the floor She leaves
her hat and the keys and runs out the door with her doll

Leda stands her arm against the window watching a tiny drop
of blood form on her skin
INT SEASIDE APARTMENT LIVING ROOM HALLWAY - DUSK 134

LATER

Leda sits lost in thought on the sofa it’s almost dark
now

She gets up slowly and turns on a lamp She walks gingerly
over to a closet and pulls out her suitcases
EXT SEASIDE APARTMENT STAIRS - NIGHT 135

Leda elegantly dressed hair brushed stands on the landing
in the hallway

Moving very slowly she pushes one of her suitcases down the
stairs then leans against the wall watching as it bumps
against each step on its way down

There is A SMALL BLOOD STAIN ON THE SILK OF HER BLOUSE

INTEXT LEDA’S CAR RED FLAG ROAD - NIGHT 136
Leda’s car speeds down the two-lane seaside road The sea is
on one side dunes on the other lit by a bright moon

EXT RED FLAG ROAD - NIGHT 137
WE ARE BACK WHERE WE STARTED

Leda’s car has careened into the guardrail off the small
beach road

Leda emerges from the car She looks around dazed

Leda continues toward the water in the moonlight
We watch from the road as she collapses on the beach

DISSOLVE TO

EXT RED FLAG BEACH - DAWN 138

We are very close on Leda as she lies passed out by the
shore

Suddenly the sun crests the horizon Its light hits Leda’s
face It is extremely bright

Leda slowly opens her eyes squinting against the intensity
of the sunlight

A big wave hits Leda’s body the cold water shocking her
She takes in a sudden deep surprised breath

CUT TO

EXT RED FLAG BEACH - NIGHT 139

Leda sits in the sand still a little wet She is deep in
thought

HER PHONE RINGS

She jumps as if she forgot she had it with her She finds
the phone in her pocket She looks at the screen answers

LEDA
Bianca It’s mama

There is a blast of sound from the other end of the phone We
hear her daughters’ excited voices but muted

BIANCA MARTHA
I know mom I called YOU Mama You haven’t called us
in so long

LEDA
Oh you’re both there Martha
Little thing

MARTHA AND BIANCA
(still speaking over each
other playfully almost
shouting)
Mama Mom Where have you been Oh
my god mom We literally thought
you were dead

LEDA
(deeply moved)
Dead
(she considers this)
No I’m alive actually

On Leda as her daughters talk on the other end of the phone
Bubbling laughing needing things explaining things

As she listens Leda puts her fingers to her wound She
looks at the blood it leaves on her fingers

She opens her hand and AN ORANGE magically appears in her
palm

With bloody fingers listening to her daughters talk she
sits in the sand and peels the orange In one long piece
like a snake

THE END
