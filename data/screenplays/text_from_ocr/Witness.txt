God Fred
RACHEL

At home youd never hear a woman
scream at a man that way

ELAINE
No Why not

RACHEL
You just wouldnt Its not the Amish

But I think it would have done me
good if I could have screamed at

son of a bitch push you around okay

Rachel smiles

Book gives her a look

BOOK
Oh Anything else

RACHEL

Oh yes She thinks you like policing
