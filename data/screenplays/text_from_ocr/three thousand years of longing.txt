THREE THOUSAND YEARS

OF

LONGING

Screenplay
by

George Miller and Augusta Gore
BLACK SCREEN

THE NARRATOR (VO)
My name is Alithea My story ts true

Yow’re more likely to believe me however

if tell it as a fairy tale

HIGH IN THE CLOUDS

Acommon PASSENGER JET advances into frame - close above us its nose belly
and wings overwhelm

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
SoOnce upon a time when humans

hurtled across the sky on metal wings

INSIDE THE PLANE

As we creep along the aisle an oceanographic documentary screens on the in-flight
entertainment

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
When they wore webbed ‘feet

and walked on the bottom of the Sed

Further along a passenger - wearing earbuds - is scrolling through a playlist on his
smart phone

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
When they held in their hands glass tiles

that could coax love songs from the air

We settle on ALITHEA BINNIE

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
There was a woman adequately happy and alone

She has the concave posture of a constant reader

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
Alone by choice

A book is reflected in the lenses of her glasses Her EYES dart briskly utterly
focused

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
Happy because she was independent

living off the exercise of her scholarly mind

She is reading with startling rapidity running her thumb down the margins of each
page for little more than a second before flicking to the next Her leg jiggling all the
while
THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
Her business was Story

She was a narratologist
who sought to find the truths common to

all the stories of humankind

Oblivious to the GLANCES of the PASSENGERS around her she finishes the book
There are two more waiting to be read

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
To this end once or twice a year

she ventured to strange lands - to China the South Seas
and the timeless cities of the Levant
Through the clouds the MINARETS OF ISTANBUL glisten below
The aircrafts UNDERCARRIAGE opens

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
Where her kind gathered to tell stories about stories

The WHEELS approach the TARMAC and

SLAM

CUT TO the WOBBLY SQUEALING WHEEL of a BAGGAGE CART
ALITHEA BINNIE pushes it making her way through the crowd at
ISTANBUL AIRPORT

A HEAVY HAND brushes hers aside rudely grabbing the handle of the cart

She looks up to see an UNSETTLING MAN small and bald in a voluminous
sheepskin jacket

He FORCES HER CART in an unwanted direction

UNSETTLING MAN
This way

ALITHEA
Excuse me

UNSETTLING MAN
This way lady

She tries to steer it back

ALITHEA
What are you doing Can you let go please

He looks AT HER DIRECTLY with pale cold eyes
UNSETTLING MAN
(insistent)
The mysteries of Istanbul

For a moment his skin seems to be VAPOROUS and a few FLECKS of FINE ASH
float around him

Then
GUNHAN RIFAT
(off screen)
ALITHEA ALITHEA

She and the Unsettling Man look across the crowd to

The IMPOSING FIGURE of Professor GUNHAN RIFAT (40’s exuberant) making his
way towards them

When she turns back THE MAN has SLUNK into the CROWD
OTHER WORLDLY he shimmers - like A MIRAGE Then HE IS GONE
GUNHAN RIFAT

Welcome Welcome at last
My dear friend

ALITHEA
Gtnhan

GUNHAN embraces her generously

As she is introduced to the GREETING PARTY ALITHEA REMAINS DISTRACTED
while listening to the small-talk

‘This is Amina’ from the British Council’

The DRIVER steps forward to take the baggage but

Alithea Binnie INSISTS on pushing her own cart towards the carpark
LATER TRAVELLING IN THE CAR

ALITHEA watches the street life of Istanbul from the front seat but she is
preoccupied

ALITHEA
That fellow at the airport manhandling my luggage
Did you see him

GUNHAN
What fellow

ALITHEA
He scuttled off when you arrived
Small Sheepskin Jacket Pink Collar

The OTHERS shake their heads
GUNHAN
Interesting

ALITHEA
He was hot to touch
Musky
GUNHAN

(casually)
Perhaps he was a Djinn

SEMIH THE DRIVER
An illegal taxi driver more likely

BRITISH COUNCIL LADY
Wearing too much cologne

They are enjoying themselves

ALITHEA continues her line of inquiry

ALITHEA
So Professor you’re saying you believe in Djinn

GUNHAN
believe there are those who need to believe in them

ALITHEA
Including me

GUNHAN
Djinn ghosts Aliens
Whatever helps

Everyone chuckles except
ALITHEA who remains UNSETTLED
A bird’s-eye view of
THE GRAND PERA PALAS HOTEL
Distinctly Belle Epoque
A Bell Boy and the GREETING PARTY guide ALITHEA to her room
The hotel has arranged a lovely surprise for you’
THE DOOR TO ROOM 333 IS OPENED
GUNHAN
Its the Agatha Christie Room

In this room she wrote ‘Murder on the Orient Express’

ALITHEA is ushered in It is charmingly appointed and lined with books
A PORTER
Lifts her suitcases onto the rack The bag tags are ripped off
ALITHEA latches the door shut CLACK

Finally a moment of solitude and reflectionto let go of the strange presence that
unsettled her at the airport

THE CHAPEL OF HAGIA IRENE TOPKAPI PALACE
This is where the symposium is being held
It is packed with Narratologists from all over the globe

They LAUGH in response to Professor GUNHAN’s joviality as he continues with his
address

GUNHAN
Sohow would you explain the power of a thunderstorm
if you don’t have the means
to measure and model meteorological data

ALITHEA is seated on a swivel chair on one side of the stage
On the other side GUNHAN is controlling the PowerPoint

GUNHAN
How can you explain the seasons -
Autumn through Winter to Spring and Summer

GUNHAN clicks the remote On one of the large screens behind him we see an
ANIMATION of the EARTH’S PATH around the SUN - its light favouring one
hemisphere over the other

GUNHAN
if you don’t know that the earth orbits the sun
while tilted on an axis

The CONSEQUENCES of this are seen in IMAGES of the seasons

GUNHAN
Everything was mystery

The Seasons Tsunamis Microbial disease
What else could we do but resort to stories
(gesturing to Alithea)

As Dr Binnie has encouraged us to understand
stories were once the only way
to make our bewildering existence coherent

ALITHEA
Thats exactly right

ALITHEA turns to address the AUDIENCE
ALITHEA
We gave name to the unknown forces behind
all wonders and catastrophe
by telling each other

As she speaks the CAMERA GLIDES across the back of her headfrom one side to
the otherand we reveal

A PALE PRESENCE on the BALCONY above the crowd

ALITHEA
By telling each other stories

Does anyone else notice the eerie elongated FIGURE

She closes her eyes When she opens them
It is GONE
NO IT’S NOT

Its on the OTHER SIDE of the auditorium SITTING several rows back in the
CROWD

We hold ALITHEAS face while in the background GUNHAN continues

GUNHAN
Let me show you

With this he clicks the screen

The PLANETARY ANIMATION is replaced by GODDESSES of the SEASONS and
HARVEST

GUNHAN
We told tales of specific powerful relatable Gods
Ever-present in all cultures in all mythologies

We see the Greek PERSEPHONE The Norse FREYA and their kind

GUNHAN

From the Greeks to the Romans
to the Norse and so on

ALITHEA cannot look away from the PALE PRESENCE
She chances a look at GUNHAN to see if he can see it too When she looks back
It is sitting in the ROW directly INFRONT OF HER

Everyone else is looking at the SCREENS where images of the MANY GODS are
arranged into complex FAMILY TREES

GUNHAN
The familiar descendants of Zeus
Poseidon Athena Thor the whole gang -
find expression even today

The GENEALOGIES of the Greek and Norse Gods EVOLVE into
The present-day MARVEL and DC SUPERHEROES

GUNHAN
These are their vestiges

Fascinated by the PALE PRESENCE ALITHEA speaks as if directly to it

ALITHEA
The question remains - what is their purpose

Unnoticed by anyone else the PRESENCE gets slowly to its feet
ALITHEA mirrors its action Standing Meeting its gaze

ALITHEA
What do we require of them now

Its as if she is waiting for an answer
Puzzled by ALITHEAS odd behaviour GUNHAN tries to prompt her

GUNHAN
There is Mythos and there is Science

She remains distracted
ALITHEA
Mythology is what we knew back then

Science is what we know so far
Sooner or later our creation stories are replaced
by the narratives of science Painstaking science

And all Gods and Monsters
outlive their original purpose -
and are reduced to metaphor

LOUD UNSETTLING VOICE
RUBBISH

ALITHEA looks to the AUDIENCE

No one else - including GUNHAN - seems to have heard it

Yet out of the MASS of FACES

The PALE PRESENCE RUSHES FORWARD with a SILENT ROAR
Its CAVERNOUS TOOTHLESS MAW emitting a dark vapour

Squid-inking the SCREEN to

BLACK
For a long moment there is no sound

Then the murmur of the crowd
VARIOUS VOICES
(spoken in Turkish subtitled in English)
She fainted
Why
don’t knowShe just fell
And - as if emerging from underwater - the voice of GUnhan calling her name

CLOSE on ALITHEAS FACE from a bizarre angle Her eyes roll into place and find
focus Now she realises

She is flat on her back on the floor
Nearby her chair lies fallen

Despite GUnhan’s protests she gets to her feet

GUNHAN
Are you okay

As he ushers her off stage she gives a ‘thumbs up’ - indicating she’s okay
The AUDIENCE begins a relieved APPLAUSE
CUT TO

The CLAP-CLAP-CLAP of a WOODEN RATTLE twirled by a street vendor in

THE AVENUE OUTSIDE TOPKAPI PALACE
Where ALITHEA is walking briskly - as if away from something
GUNHAN hurries to catch up

GUNHAN
Shouldn’t you see a doctor

ALITHEA
Why When feel so well

GUNHAN
Forgive me Alithea are you sure

ALITHEA
Apart from the usual aches and pains
there is nothing untoward Nothing to make a fuss
She marches forward

GUNHAN
So what happened back there

She stops owing him a proper answer
ALITHEA

Lately my imagination’s been getting the better of me
Ambushing me
GUNHAN needs more

ALITHEA
think it’s a warning

GUNHAN
About what

ALITHEA
Not to be complacent To keep on my toes
It manifests rudely from time to time
try not to fight it off It takes charge for a moment
then it steps back

GUNHAN
What steps back

ALITHEA
Oh Ginhan it’s irrational
Pay it no mind

She strides on

Again GUNHAN hurries after her - concerned

GUNHAN
You are behaving like a child
you know that

ALITHEA
You know am actually a child

LATER THE VASTNESS OF THE GRAND BAZAAR

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
of there is fate can we escape it Who can say
But 1 tell you this
In the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul
there are 62 streets and 4000 shops

Tracking shots of an endless variety of shop fronts
Each of them overabundant with wares

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
And in one of those shops there are three rooms

In the smallest of those rooms there was a pile
of things unsorted old and new

We find our way there

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
From the bottom of that pile J chose a memento
It is a SMALL GLASS BOTTLE

She holds it in her hand wipes away the dust Half of it is a whirl of blue-white stripes
and the other half malformed as if melted

She finds the YOUNG SHOPKEEPER at the counter

ALITHEA
Do you know what this is

He takes THE BOTTLE from her and tries to improve its appearance He gives the
GLASS STOPPER an experimental twist but it does not budge

YOUNG SHOPKEEPER
I’m not sure But it could be Cesm-i Bulbul - a ‘Nightingale’s Eye’
Around 1845 there were these glassmakers in Incirkoy
they were famous for this spiral blue white pattern
GUNHAN steps in
GUNHAN
Please it’s a gift from me
Choose something less forlorn
ALITHEA
And if this is Cesm-i Bulbul
is there a way of authenticating it
The Young Shopkeeper holds the bottle up to the light
YOUNG SHOPKEEPER
They say - if it’s genuine - sometimes you can see
specks of blood from the lungs of the glassblowers
He hands it back to Alithea

YOUNG SHOPKEEPER
But this is more likely a recent imitation

GUNHAN is offering more expensive gifts

GUNHAN

Its been damaged by fire
Pick something else
ALITHEA
No thank you Gunhan like it
Whatever it is I’m sure it has an interesting story

She places it on the counter for the Young Shopkeeper to wrap
FADE TO BLACK
The bird’s-eye view of

THE GRAND PERA PALAS HOTEL

TIME LAPSE from pre-dawn to early morning
IN HER BATHROOM
ALITHEA’S GLASSES sit - fogged - on the vanity

She picks them up loops the lanyard over her head swathes her wet hair in a towel
and pootles into the

BEDROOM
Where she answers the phone
ALITHEA
Hello Good morning
(confirming her order)
YesRunny pleaseyes but no crusts
No Just one Thank you

As she speaks ALITHEA gazes at the small PACKAGE containing the CESM-
BULBUL BOTTLE

She picks it up and unwraps it as she heads back into the
BATHROOM

She sets the tissue paper aside and runs THE BOTTLE under the tap She rubs away
at the grimy surface revealing more of its cobalt blue and white pattern

With her thumbs and fingers she massages the clay-encrusted stopper But it won’t
come loose

Now she goes at it with her ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH

The VIBRATIONS intensify andfrom within

FFOOOOSSHHK

THE CESM-I BULBUL LEAPS FROM HER HAND like a frog

The stopper falls tinkling but unbroken into the basin

THENfrom its mouth

A thermal blast which ignites the tissue paper in which it was wrapped

This is followed by a WISPan EMANATIONa prodigious FLOW from the BOTTLE
It billows CRIMSON BLUE GREY and BLACK as it surges into the BEDROOM

ALITHEA is taken aback
Her glasses fall off her face and hang from the lanyard around her neck

The bathroom is cast in shadow as an ENORMOUS FOOT (out of focus) blocks the
doorway

She is puzzled Apprehensive Trying to process whats before her

FIVE GREAT TOES a throbbing vein inside an ANKLE of EBONY SHEENED SKIN
Unstable vaporous
After a moment she steps forward and reaches out to touch the FOOT But it
SWELLS and RETRACTS with a sucking sound into the bedroom from where is
heard a THRUMMING MURMUR Deep Musical An incantation of gratitude or
expletive perhaps
ALITHEA follows the foot into
THE BEDROOM
Where she sees the rest of THE DJINN
A hulking inevitable presence BLUE-BLACK like a moonlit night
ALITHEA
I’m going to close my eyes and count to three
After which would be grateful if you were gone

She closes her EYES

ALITHEA
OneTwo Three

When she opens them
She is clearly unsatisfied
So she closes them again Willing him away

ALITHEA
Four Five SixSeven Eight Nine Ten

When her EYES OPEN once more

HE IS STILL THERE

SILHOUETTED and OUT OF FOCUS his DARK FIGURE is CRAMMED into the
room curled around himself like a snake His huge head and shoulders pushing

against the ceiling

ALITHEA puts on her glasses to examine the SKIN OF HIS BACK Polychromatic
Like satin

She cannot see his face He is TURNED AWAY from her - murmuring in an unknown
language (this is Djinnbish)

ALITHEA
don’t suppose you speak English

No response

ALITHEA
Deutsch Espanol Ellenika

THE DJINN turns one of his long elegantly shaped ears to listen
THE DJINN

(Spoken in Ancient Greek subtitled in English)
You speak the Greek of Homer
His voice does not conform to the expected acoustics of the room It is at once
a whisper and a bellow

What else can ALITHEA do but respond

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
took some classes at university

THE DJINN’s form seems to be fluctuating - coming more into proportion

(Parts of him are covered in finely woven pearlescent scales melded with intricate bird-
of-paradise feathers)

THE DJINN
(in Ancient Greek)
Please - do not fear me nor treat me casually
am beholden to you for this release
On that account must grant you three wishes

She is SCEPTICAL Uneasy
CURIOUS about this world

THE DJINN begins to run his hand across the bookshelves - his fingers seem to be
drawing scintillations from the books s this how he learns

THE DJINN
(in Ancient Greek)
There are laws which cannot be broken
Three is three a number of power
thus you may not wish for endless wishes

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
Yes I’m familiar with the concept

Now he is BRUSHING his hand over the desk The Bible The Quran in English
Glossy magazines Even Alithea’s LAPTOP

THE DJINN
(in Ancient Greek)
Nor may you wish for eternal life
It is your nature to be mortal
Mine to be immortal

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
Naturally

THE DJINN
(in Ancient Greek)
Nor can absolve sin or end all suffering
am only a Djinn

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
That’s reasonable
THE DJINN
(in Ancient Greek)
These are the limits

At this point he places a FINGER on top of the TV causing it to SWITCH ON
Its as if THE DJINN is absorbing its content

AMAN is giving a PRESENTATION - in English - on an adventurous technological
advance

The Man is ALBERT EINSTEIN

THE DJINN
(in Ancient Greek)
What is this small human

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
He is a Wizard
Guiding us through time Einstein

THE DJINN
(in Ancient Greek)
‘Einstein’
Are you a witch
who has him in a box

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
No It is science
(English)
‘Television’

He echoes her

THE DJINN
‘Television’

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
Waves of light and sound ‘transmitters’

THE DJINN
‘Transmitters’

ALITHEA
(in Ancient Greek)
I’m not sure how it works
am a literary scholar We don’t know much

THE DJINN
(in English)
am a Djinn of modest power but
begin to understand these ‘transmissions’

ALITHEA
Oh You have learnt to speak my language
THE DJINN
This English is straightforward
Its rules quickly learn find
Now he prods the image on the TV screen
There is a sound High-pitched Its volume increasing

AGRID of PIXELS emerges in the form of a TINY ALBERT EINSTEIN

He stands dazed in THE DJINN’S PALM while the image on the screen is frozen mid-
presentation

THE DJINN
Would you like this Little Albert for yourself

ALITHEA
No no That can’t be good for him
Put him back
THE DJINN
could expand him
We could speak with him

TINY ALBERT EINSTEIN

how is this possible
ALITHEA
No
Put him back
TINY ALBERT EINSTEIN stumbles about his bewilderment intensifying
The high-pitched sound builds to an alarming crescendo

THE DJINN
Is that your wish

He peers at her from OVER HIS SHOULDER Revealing one of his LARGE EYES

ALITHEA
No It’s your obligation

With a gentle puff THE DJINN blows Einstein’s image back into the TV
In that instant the high-pitched sound stops
ALBERT EINSTEIN recovers and continues his speech
On ALITHEA as THE DJINN shifts to address her
THE DJINN
So what will you wish for

What is your heart’s desire

ALITHEA
Now let’s not get ahead of ourselves

She TURNS AWAY FROM HIM
ALITHEA
need to take this slow

She removes her glasses

THE DJINN
(casuall
have all the time in the world
Tell me about yourself

ALITHEA
(hurriedly)
My name is Alithea Binnie
am in Turkey for a conference
and return to my homeland in a day’s time

THE DJINN
Also

ALITHEA
Also have a confession to make

He nods encouragement
ALITHEA
Something I’ve never told anybody

THE DJINN
Excellent

ALITHEA
When was young there was a boy

THE DJINN
Your first lover

ALITHEA
No he was not of flesh and blood

THE DJINN
A Djinn

ALITHEA
No At that time found myself in a school for girls
Gaggles of girls
waswell am a
solitary creature by nature

Now we see

A CROWDED DORMITORY - 1983

Among the students - vigorous in their evening activities - ONE SITS STILL at a desk
HER BACK TO US She is reading leg jiggling as she flicks from one page to the
next with startling rapidity TWELVE-YEAR-OLD ALITHEA

ALITHEA (VO)
And this boy Enzo he came to me

She sits on one half of the chair as if sharing it with an invisible friend
ALITHEA (VO)
He came out of an emptiness
a need to imagine

The image MORPHS briefly into a NOTEBOOK DRAWING of ENZO SITTING NEXT
TO HER
ALITHEA (VO)
He told me stories
in a language only we two spoke

The back of YOUNG ALITHEA’S THORAX - her shoulders hunch and her neck
muscles strain She is struggling to breathe Her face is masked by a nebulizer

She is alone in the SCHOOL INFIRMARY
ALITHEA (VO)
He would disappear when had a headache
but was always there when couldn’t move for asthma

A delicate almost translucent HAND SETTLES ON HER SHOULDER Comforting
her As her breathing eases the hand fades away

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
On ALITHEA

THE DJINN

He was like this Little Albert you would not let me give you
An emanation
ALITHEA
Only the emanation of an absence
feared he would leave so wrote him down

WE SEE

Her youthful hand WRITING in a SCRAPBOOK thick with pressed flowers collages
of magazine clippings drawings notes and letters

ALITHEA (VO)

filled this journal bulging with facts

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
ALITHEA
But the more realism tried to insert
the more began to doubt
The whole thing felt silly felt silly

IMAGES
Of several burning scrapbooks CINDERED PAPER floating on the air

ALITHEA (VO)
After a time burnt it all in the school furnace

Her DRAWING of ENZO’S smiling face - distorted by the intensifying flames
IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA
And he disappeared altogether

THE DJINN
Places a hand on her shoulder

THE DJINN
And yet am here

ALITHEA studies HIS FACE (and for the first time so do we)
Completely hairless Huge eyelids hood lovely dark eyes flecked with malachite
High cheekbones An imperious hooked nose A wide simmering mouth sculpted like
an Egyptian pharaoh’s
ALITHEA
(warily)
Contrary to reasonyes
He takes her by both shoulders and gently wobbles her
THE DJINN
am here
And we have work to do
THEN
A polite TAP TAP at the door
This interrupts ALITHEA’S focus
TAP TAP TAP

ALITHEA
Can you come back later please

MALE VOICE
Its Room Service
Dr Binnie have your breakfast
THE DJINN indicates it’s okay for her to go
She looks at him as if to say ‘Are you sure’

He nods

ALITHEA
Just a minute

ALITHEA puts on her glasses and - as she walks hesitantly to the door - the ambient
light lifts She looks back into the room to see

THE DJINN is gone

We may notice that the soundscape has become more naturalistic -
The humming of an air conditioner distant traffic below and an aircraft overhead

She unhitches the latch and OPENS THE DOOR to find the TURKISH WAITER with
breakfast

ALITHEA
Ill take it Thank you

TURKISH WAITER
Please allow me

She grabs the tray
TURKISH WAITER
Jolly good Dr Binnie
hope you’re well rested

ALITHEA
believe so

She places the tray on a side table
TURKISH WAITER

What do you plan to do on this fine day
Visit the sights of Istanbul

She signs the docket and politely ushers the WAITER out

ALITHEA
I’m not sure I’m improvising

TURKISH WAITER
Jolly good Enjoy

AT THE DOOR

ALITHEA watches as he walks off down the corridor She pauses looking this way
and that

The world outside her room seems normal

She hangs the ‘Do Not Disturb’ sign

Latches the door shut CLACK

All is quiet

As she moves back into the empty room

THE DJINN EMERGES from the BATHROOM

He is now the height of a VERY LARGE BASKETBALL PLAYER

ALITHEA
Amore convenient size see

Although it’s a snug fit he too is wearing a bathrobe - matching Alithea’s

DJINN
do what can to fit in

He is carrying a TRAY adorned by a single flower in the neck of the Melted Bottle and
LADEN with DELICACIES

THE DJINN
(offering them)
Please

ALITHEA checks out the sherberts the figs and the pomegranates

ALITHEA
needn’t have ordered breakfast

Cautiously she selects a SMALL SHORTBREAD
THE DJINN
It is Nan-e nokhodchi
Chickpeas cloves and pistachio
It will melt in your mouth
THE DJINN watches as
Struggling with her disbelief ALITHEA takes a bite Savouring it
It is a wonder and it WEAKENS her scepticism
THE DJINN lays out the tray on a small table

He POURS ROSE TEA for them both before EASING his large frame onto the floor
She sits in the CHAIR OPPOSITE

ALITHEA
May ask you something

THE DJINN
Anything

ALITHEA
How come you found your way into my bottle

THE DJINN
Its quite a story
That was my third incarceration

ALITHEA
Youve been trapped in a bottle three times

THE DJINN
may be a Djinn but am also a fool
with too great a fondness for the conversation of women

He leans forward
THE DJINN
need to be more careful in the future

ALITHEA
How were you caught in the first place

THE DJINN
By desire how else

ALITHEA
Who was she

THE DJINN
Sheba

ALITHEA
The Queen of Sheba

THE DJINN
She was my kin

ALITHEA
She was a Djinn

THE DJINN
Her mother was a Djinn

ALITHEA
Is that possible

THE DJINN
There are laws that allow the union of Djinn and mortals
but they cannot produce an immortal scion
As a donkey and a horse can only produce a seedless mule

ALITHEA
What did she look like

THE DJINN
Other than a thick glade of black hair on her legs
she looked like any other human
except of course she wasSheba
He says it with longing

ALITHEA
By all accounts she was very beautiful

THE DJINN
She was not beautiful She was Beauty itself

He looks out the window

The LIGHT plays on HIS PROFILE

THE DJINN
was in every way free
would come in and out of her sleeping-chamber

We EASE FORWARD on THE DJINN

As he leans in

TO KISS THE NAPE of SHEBA’S NECK

And thus we are BACK IN TIME - 3000 YEARS

THE DJINN (VO)
And knew as well as any of her female slaves
the touches that made her shiver with bliss

When his LIPS make contact they form a VAPOUR which as it cascades down her
naked back becomes a thousand miniature BUTTERFLIESnow morphing into
schools of TINY FISH that tickle pour and gush around the contours of her buttocks

THE DJINN (VO)
Never have wanted a creature so

ALITHEA (VO)
And she desired you in return

BACK IN THE PRESENT - IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN
was her plaything her confidant
might have become more but for Solomon

ALITHEA
King Solomon (I take it)

THE DJINN
Blessed be his memory
He came from across the deserts to woo her

ALITHEA
Didnt she go to him

THE DJINN

(indignant)
No Never

ALITHEA
But it’s in all the holy books The stories
The paintings Handel wrote music about it
THE DJINN
Madam was there
Solomon came to her
A PANORAMIC VIEW OF

An APPROACHING PARADE of envoys artisans beasts of burden festooned with
gifts and a vast army snaking back across the DESERT to the horizon

All of this is being watched by

THE QUEEN OF SHEBA from a WINDOW HIGH in her FORTRESS

Standing close behind this MAGNIFICENT YOUNG WOMAN THE DJINN whispers in
her ear

THE DJINN
(Spoken in Early Aramaic)
You are Queen free as a mighty bird
seeing all things with an even eye
How can you submit to the chains
that bind you to a man
QUEEN OF SHEBA
(in Early Aramaic)
Sweet cousin Djinn
there is no man who could so beguile me
KING SOLOMON PRESENTS HIMSELF TO THE QUEEN OF SHEBA
It is a phantasmagorical tableau
SHE is sitting high on her THRONE surrounded by her courtiers and

A MENAGERIE consisting not only of cheetahs panthers lions and monkeys
but also - in all shapes and sizes - Ifrits Daemons and Djinn Including ours

His eyes are on SHEBA as she gazes down at SOLOMON masterfully playing his
LUTE

THE DJINN (VO)
He began with music

Then

A STRING on his instrument SNAPS His finger is bleeding

SOLOMON looks up at SHEBA searching her face for empathy He finds none
By way of magic he repairs the string and forges on

As the music builds we see that Solomon’s instrument is enchanted Its carvings
animated by wood spirits - dryads - vocalising and playing accompaniment

It is exquisite and heart-stopping

Slowly drawing in the MENAGERIE of courtiers

We creep in on SHEBA’S noble INSCRUTABLE face

The COURTIERS turn discreetly towards herlooking for the slightest response
On her LARYNX a little gulp

IN THE SLEEPING CHAMBER

While a handmaiden massages SHEBA’S HAIRLESS LEG Sheba herself pours
melted wax on her other thigh covered still in a patterned glade of thick hair

THE DJINN (VO)
did all that could to dissuade her
But when she used the scented wax of the Jabassa Bee
to remove the hair from her legs -
knew that was lost

SHEBA listens intently as THE DJINN whispers in her ear

THE DJINN (VO)
But I like a fool went on telling her
that her body was rich and lovely
but her mind was richer and lovelier and more durable
And she agreed with all said and dropped a hot tear

THE DJINN gently licks away THE TEAR hovering on her cheek
IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA is holding her cup of rose tea but she is not drinking

THE DJINN
She began to set him tasks which seemed impossible
To find a particular thread of red silk
in the palace of a thousand rooms
To guess the secret name of her mother Djinn
To tell her what women most desire

ALITHEA
That does seem impossible

He shrugs ruefully
THE DJINN
Not for him He could speak to the beasts of the earth
and to the Djinn made of Subtle Fire
CLOSE ON AN ANT
Dragging a RED SILK THREAD over ancient stone

THE DUJINN (VO)
He found ants to discover the thread of silk

A CREATURE WITH METAL FEATHERS
Speaks FURTIVELY in SOLOMON’s ear

THE DJINN (VO)
and an Ifrit to whisper the mother’s name

IN THE SLEEPING CHAMBER
ON SHEBA’S FACEas SOLOMON draws her near

THE DUJINN (VO)

Then he looked into her eyes
and told her what women most desire
She was astonished
and said that he was right

Perched unseen
HIGH ON A TALL COLUMN
THE DJINN watches SOLOMON and SHEBA far below - their bodies entwined

THE DUJINN (VO)
And so she granted him what he most desired
which was to wed her and be taken to her bed

SHEBA

Is astride SOLOMON They roll into CLOSE UP and underneath him now
She CRIES OUT in ECSTASY

In unison with her

THE DJINN

HOWLS in ANGUISH as he turns away from the heart-tearing sight
Disclosing himself to

SOLOMON

Who - barely looking up from his prize - lifts a slender finger and begins to draw THE
DJINN down towards them

The poor creature does all he can to resist but the VORTEX is SO POWERFUL he
seems to LIQUEFY VAPORIZE and thus is SUCKED ENTIRELY INTO

A SMALL BRASS BOTTLE within reach of THE LOVERS (It is the same bottle from
which Sheba poured the bees wax onto her thigh)

THE DJINN (VO)
He was a great magician
and imprisoned me with a word of power in a brass bottle
THE STOPPER of the bottle seals itself with the red silk thread

With one swift flourish SOLOMON HURLS THE BOTTLE out the open window behind
him

Before it drops to the ground a GREAT RAVEN swoops takes it in his beak and
flies off across the vast expanse of DESERT

CLOSE ON
The UNFORGETTABLE FACE of SHEBA glowing with sweat and pleasure

THE DJINN (VO)
She made no plea for me was nothing to her
A breath in a bottle

THE BRASS BOTTLE

Is carried in the CLAWS of the RAVEN who soars over the masts of the EGYPTIAN
FISHING DHOWS

The RAVEN releases his grip on the bottle
Then
THE BOTTLE breaks the surface of the water and sinks into the darkness

THE DJINN (VO)
And so was cast into the Red Sea
and languished for two and a half thousand years

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA waits for his painful memories to subside Not sure what to say she offers
him the tray of delicacies

He declines
She resumes her seat

ALITHEA
Apart from sleep what does one do in a bottle
for two and a half thousand years

THE DJINN
Djinn don’t sleep

Now he’s on his feet - pacing

ALITHEA
Then how do you manage

THE DJINN
For the first one hundred years
rage against my fate
pray to Boschkolo for release
When that does not work
pray to any God know
and then to any God may not know
And when still find no answers
spend my time in waking-dreams
revisiting all the stories of my life
When have exhausted this many many times
return to my rage and my prayer
and finally play a trick on myself

She leans in

THE DJINN
pray to remain in the bottle
beseech Boschkolo to keep me always in the bottle

ALITHEA
Does it work
He plonks himself down on the bed

THE DJINN
To yearn for nothing
To pretend to want nothing more
than to be contained in a bottle
For a Djinn it is the closest we ever come to death

This gives her pause Then

ALITHEA
Do you know the answer to her question

THE DJINN
What women most desire

ALITHEA
Yes

This is where he wants her to go

THE DJINN
Don’t you know If you do not know already
cannot tell you

ALITHEA
Well surely we don’t all want the same thing

THE DJINN
Madam your yearnings are not at all clear to me

He nibbles a biscuit from the tray

ALITHEA
I’m at a point in my life where have all need
dare say am content and gratefully so

THE DJINN
(probing)
Tell me this thenare you a wife
A mother A widow perhaps

ALITHEA
have no children no siblings no parents
did once have a husband

THE DJINN
Aah And what was the complexion of this husband

ALITHEA
His complexion
In the beginning it wasglowing

THE DJINN
And in the ending

ALITHEA
Its not much of a story

THE DJINN
But it is your story
And it is always wise to understand those
who have a hold on you Please

ALITHEA
(shrugs)
Well we’d known each other from our youth
We married early
ALITHEA’S PHOTO ALBUM - 2006
A Kodak print of ALITHEA and her HUSBAND in academic gowns is being inserted
between others of their LIFE TOGETHER In each one he has an arm around her
while she stands awkwardly Some have hand-written annotations ‘Faculty dinner
March 3 1996 Jack ate fish had chicken He liked my orange dress’
ALITHEA (VO)

In the beginning we took pleasure in each other’s minds
And bodies We passed the years comfortably

Then
A PREGNANCY TEST STICK - showing POSITIVE - is taped to the album Then
A SONOGRAM image of a foetus in its first trimester It is annotated
‘The first and last image of little Enzo’
The next page is blank
She closes the ALBUM and places it in a box - marked STORAGE
BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
ALITHEA
But as it happens it all evaporated

and we becameless

THE DJINN
Where is he

ALITHEA
He’s in Hackney with Emmeline Porter

IN A LONDON TAXI
ALITHEA is speed reading The taxi brakes for traffic causing her to look up

There on the CROWDED FOOTPATH she sees HER HUSBAND and ANOTHER
WOMAN - they can’t keep their hands off each other She seems enthralled by him

ALITHEA is momentarily surprised
ALITHEA (VO)
He told me was incapable of reading feelings -
of reading his feelings

She studies them from the back window of the taxi as they cross the road laughing
ALITHEA (VO)
The way my brain is wired is both
the source of my powerand my solitude

We hold on HER FACE as she composes herselfthen resumes her reading
BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA
suspect that’s why like stories
find feelings through stories

THE DJINN
(enthusiastically)
Perhaps you could wish for him back

ALITHEA
No No thought might grieve over loss and betrayal but the fact is -
was free felt like a prisoner coming blinking out of a dungeon
felt myself expand into the space of my own life

ALITHEA sips tea

ALITHEA
could not wish for more

This is not what a Djinn offering wishes wants to hear

THE DJINN
You are a wise and cautious woman Alithea
But we all have desires -
even if they remain hidden from us

ALITHEA
That’s as maybe But am also a Narratologist
- and that’s going to be a problem
Avery big problem

His look is a query

ALITHEA
know all the stories of trickster Djinn
and how they manipulate wishing to their own ends

It is an unambiguous warning
It throws THE DJINN

THE DJINN
(urgently)
am not one of them
am God-fearing and honourable
am here only to grant your heart’s desire

ALITHEA
Even if that’s true
can we rely on those called on to wish

THE DJINN
Huh

ALITHEA
How do you know you can rely on me

THE DJINN
(worried)
hope so With you certainly hope so

ALITHEA gets to her feet

ALITHEA
There’s a silly little tale mean you probably know it
(matter-of-factly)
Three friends are lost at sea in a tiny boat
They pull up a magic fish who grants them each one wish
The first one ‘I wish was at home with my wife’
He vanishes
The second one ‘I wish was playing in the fields with my children’
ff he goes
And the third one ‘I miss my friends’

THE DJINN
‘ wish they were here’

She SLAPS her hands together as if to say - ‘Just like that’
Looking at THE DJINN firmly

ALITHEA
You’ve got it
There is no story about wishing that is not a cautionary tale
None end happily Not even the ones that are supposed to be jokes

THE DJINN
You and are the authors of this story
we can avoid all the traps

She looks at him clinically

ALITHEA
Well what if made no wish at all

THE DJINN
Pardon

ALITHEA
What if made no wish

This triggers a deep ANXIETY in him

THE DJINN
Umm(That would be)unusual
(That would be)catastrophic

He jumps to his feet ENLARGING banging his head on the CEILING LIGHT
which swings violently as he stabilises to his more comfortable size (This is a
Djinn glitch)

THE DJINN
(agitated)
need to tell you about my next incarceration
ALITHEA
I’m all ears

He HURRIES in the telling

THE DJINN
will never know how my bottle came
from the bottom of the Red Sea

The IMAGES that follow match the URGENCY in his VOICE
WE SEE (AT SPEED)
A FISHING NET dropped onto a shore
The net flops open to reveal small fish and an OCTOPUS entwined in what appears to
be a TEAR-SHAPED STONE It is the BRASS BOTTLE now THICKLY ENCRUSTED
after 2500 years
Rough hands pull the octopus off the stone - which is tossed aside
THE DJINN (VO)

to a palace in Constantinople
But fancy somehow that it involved

A SOLDIER - face down - is TURNED OVER

Revealing the skeleton of aROTTING CORPSE Maggots and worms slither around a
tear-shaped stone which is yanked from the EYE SOCKET

THE DJINN (VO)
the killing of an Ottoman warrior

Next

A WOMAN’S HAND

Uses the STONE as a pestle - grinding brightly coloured spices in a mortar
Then

Alabourer slots THE STONE carefully into a fortress wall banging it tight with a
mallet

THE DJINN (VO)
The Fall of an empire

Later
The wall vibrates from the percussive forces of many cannon

Loosening THE STONE

THE DJINN (VO)
And a girl in love

GULTEN (18 slave girl) climbs THE WALL using the TEAR-SHAPED STONE as
her foothold She peeks over the top to catch a glimpse of

The splendid PRINCE MUSTAFA expertly riding his horse
He turns and LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HER

She DUCKS - knocking loose THE STONE

She falls to the ground

The STONE lands beside her Cracked open - it reveals the BRASS BOTTLE inside

GULTEN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
And who are you

THE DJINN (VO)
Gilten lived as a slave
in the Courtyard of the Concubines in the Seraglio
IN THE SECRET BATHROOM OF THE HAREM
GULTEN has chipped away most of the stone from the BOTTLE
Now she unpicks the hardened gunk from around the STOPPER
Which BURSTS OPENand drops to the floor spinning ERUPTING FORTH
GULTEN COWERS on the floor
When the THRUMMING stops and the room is silent she shakily gets to her feet

GULTEN looks up at what must be THE DJINN’S TOWERING FIGURE casting her in
shadow

Her big eyes spasm She topples backwards

THE DJINN (VO)
When appeared to her she fainted

His HUGE HAND reaches in and cradles her head before it smashes into the marble
at the bottom of the stairs

THE DJINN (VO)
and had great trouble rousing her

IT IS DAY

GULTEN lies on her back in the bath her eyes closed THE DJINN supports her in the
warm water He murmurs in calming tones

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN is less panicked now

THE DJINN
made it clear that meant her no harm
He looks at ALITHEA

THE DJINN
For was condemned to the bottle -

ALITHEA
(impatiently)
Until you got your three wishes

THE DJINN
Until she got hers

IN THE SECRET BATHROOM
GULTEN opens her eyes and tearfully speaks her first wish

THE DJINN (VO)
The poor girl told me she was distractedly in love
with a beautiful man and she wished immediately
to find favour in his eyes

THE IMPERIAL HALL
On a desk laden with a silversmith’s tools a GIFT is unwrapped
A finely crafted pair of RIDING SPURS - dangerous as they are elegant
THE DJINN (VO)
As it happened the one she most desired
was the splendid Mustafa Prince Mustafa
PRINCE MUSTAFA admires the spurs He is delighted
Pull back to include his father - THE SULTAN SULEIMAN - glowing with approval
THE DJINN (VO)
eldest son of Suleiman the Magnificent
and likely heir to his mighty throne
They walk off SULEIMAN’S arm around his prince
THE DJINN (VO)
Had known what was to come
would have risked the Furies of Iblis
and dissuaded her vehemently from her wish
IN THE SECRET BATHROOM

THE DJINN delicately rubs his thumb and forefinger together and a thin stream of oil
trickles into the BRASS BOTTLE It’s as if he is concocting lotion out of air

THE DJINN (VO)

But without thinking took my bottle
and conjured oils to prepare her
Oils of enchantment

Once used only by Sheba

GULTEN THE SLAVE has covered herself in a fine sheen of oil THE DJINN pours a
bit more into her hand for the finishing touches
THE DJINN (VO)
cautioned her to hide the bottle
lest its powers fall into other hands

He lifts the BULLNOSE - the WEIGHTY MARBLE SLAB at the top of the stairs
GULTEN takes the BRASS BOTTLE from him and HIDES IT in the space underneath

HE REPLACES THE SLAB
MUSTAFA’S BED
PRINCE MUSTAFA is asleep THE DJINN floats in close to his ear
THE DJINN (VO)
went to Mustafa whispered her name
He sent for her

ON PRINCE MUSTAFA’S SPURS

As he approaches two JANISSARIES guarding his CHAMBERS They swing open the
door to reveal

GULTEN WAITING FOR HIM She is veiled more for allure than modesty

THE DJINN (VO)
It was So easy

IN THE IMPERIAL HALL
THE ASSEMBLED COURT - a shock to the eye - in its splendid and gaudy regalia

THE DJINN (VO)
As a Djinn am endlessly curious
about the ways of humans
So in my spare time took to wandering the palace
in search of its intrigues

From a height we move down through this EXTRAVAGANZA

THE DUJINN (VO)
And there among the Eunuchs
the Consorts and the Concubines
first saw Hurrem - The Laughing One

She has HER BACK TO US as she charms the fawning group around her
THE DJINN (VO)
She too was a slave
who had risen through the centre of them all
to become the Sultan’s favourite

Closing in on her

The crowd hushes and looks up to a BALCONY SULEIMAN has ARRIVED HURREM
turns and we see her fully for the first timeHer open face is high-spirited and
seemingly guileless

THE DJINN (VO)

Suleiman the Wise
saw none but her

The crowd parts as a LONG SILKEN LOOP is dropped from above HURREM winds
herself in the loop and is slowly - gracefully - lifted up to join the Sultan

THE DJINN (VO)

And she sought to protect his throne
in favour of her own sons over his beloved Mustafa

All eyes are on HURREM
Everyone is LAUGHING at this playfulness including
PRINCE MUSTAFA
THE DJINN (VO)
And to this end
she had the Prince watched by many probing eyes

Behind MUSTAFA we see Hurrem’s CONSPIRATORS

Among them is THE WATCHER - a Princess of the court - glaring at him Resenting
his presence

ON THE BALCONY
SULEIMAN receives HURREM joyfully
As they head arms entwined to their private quarters

The CAMERA finds THE DJINN observing all this from his perch in the DOME
ABOVE

THE DJINN (VO)
When saw how Hirrem made
a masterpiece of her manipulations
worried that my Gulten might be
caught in this web

LATER

GULTEN emerges from Mustafa’s CHAMBERS and enters the SHADOWY
PASSAGE THE DJINN has been waiting for her

THE DJINN (VO)
tried to warn her To be careful
But she had already decided on her second wish

No longer timid she looks him in the eyes
GULTEN

(in Ottoman Turkish)
wish to be pregnant
THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
With Mustafa Please no
Please wait

GULTEN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Djinn this is my heart’s desire
Grant me my wish Now
He sags defeated

THE DJINN (VO)
Such a mistake
Because at this moment Suleiman
- blessed be his name -
is being undermined
His warriors believe he is going soft
More interested in his poetry
than ruling with a strong hand

IN THE BATHING POOLS OF THE IMPERIAL HAREM

THE DJINN (VO)
Gulten in the meantime saw no reason
why she should remain unseen

Concubines Princesses their attendants eunuchs and female slaves - going about
their daily routine

GULTEN is pouring POMEGRANATE JUICE

She is IGNORED by those whom she serves - among them
THE WATCHER

Who is suddenly startled by an EXPLOSIVE LAUGH

Its GULTEN Calling attention to herself

Fully-clothed and holding the SPOUTED POT

She jumps into the BATHING POOL

THE DJINN (VO)
Given she was carrying the son of the next Sultan

ALL EYES are now on her as she emerges
PROUDLY caressing her now evident PREGNANCY
THE DJINN (VO)
Despite my warnings

she parades her newly swollen breasts and belly

Defiantly she hurls the POT into the pool and struts off

THE DJINN (VO)
and the whispers soon reached the seraglio
The terrible plottings move all too quickly
SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT
A master of calligraphy - is crafting a love poem
HURREM wraps her arm around him and draws him to

A FILIGREED SCREEN

Through which they spy on PRINCE MUSTAFA - surrounded by his JANNISSARIES -
in the Throne Room below

THE DJINN (VO)
Hurrem fuels the rumours
that the military want to take his throne
and replace him with Mustafa
The Prince has become a pawn
in the ceaseless game of power

One bows to KISS the Prince’s SLEEVE
AN INK WELL

Has SPILLED across the CALLIGRAPHY A puddle of BLACK INK blots out
SULEIMAN’S poem

IN THE BED CHAMBERS
HURREM holds SULEIMAN’S head to her chest and soothes his brow

NOW THE SULTAN stands tall and grave as HURREM unwinds a LONG GOLD SILK
CORD binding his fine robes

THE DJINN (VO)
Suleiman the Magnificent
Suleiman the Conquerer

Patron and Protector of Empires

Suleiman the Father was left with a choice
that he knows will break his heart

A BOW STRING

Is unhitched from the Sultan’s bow

IT IS NIGHT

A HORSE AND RIDER pull up in front of a
PALATIAL WAR TENT

PRINCE MUSTAFA dismounts As the Stable Master corrals his horse he hands his
sword to one of the JANISSARIES and strides eagerly into the tent

THE DJINN (VO)

Prince Mustafa comes innocently
into the presence of his father
To reassure him of his loyalty

MUSTAFA
(in Ottoman Turkish)
My Sultan

SULEIMAN does not turn in response to this greeting As PRINCE MUSTAFA bends to
kiss the sleeve of his father’s robe SULEIMAN yanks it away

MUSTAFA
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Father

THE DJINN (VO)
And The Mutes are waiting for him

Out of the shadows behind him THE ASSASSINS emerge and MUSTAFA realises
something is DREADFULLY WRONG

In a swift highly-practiced ‘dance’ two tongueless MUTES wrap Suleiman’s BOW
STRING around MUSTAFA’S NECK

This GARROTE is hitched to the tent poles by the SILK CORD

As they drag him back another two ASSASSINS grab MUSTAFA’S LEGS and
PLOUGH his SPURS deep into the carpet - ANCHORING HIM

THE DJINN (VO)
He cried out to his Janissaries who loved him

OUTSIDE THE TENT
THE JANISSARIES bow their heads - numb to the sounds of his dying

THE DJINN (VO)
but his voice was crushed
and his breath was stopped
by the string of his father’s bow
FROM ABOVE
We watch MUSTAFA taking his FINAL BREATHS

Only when the SON falls silent does his FATHER turn to look

CLOSE ON SULEIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT

His face DISTRAUGHT

IN THE SECRET BATHROOM

GULTEN is ENTIRELY HAPPY A brazier warms her With a PEACOCK FEATHER
she playfully wafts incense around her belly and murmurs a pretty song to her unborn
baby
THE DJINN bursts in FRANTIC

THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Gulten Gulten They are coming for you
Make a wish

GULTEN leaps to her feet knocking over the BRAZIER

THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Just one more wish

She is struggling to understand

GULTEN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Why

THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Gulten They are coming to kill you

GULTEN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
The Prince will protect me

THE DJINN advances towards her

THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
There is nothing he can do
Make a wish

His desperation scares her She thrusts out the FEATHER to ward him off But
because of the fallen brazier it is now aflameand it burns her hand

GULTEN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
He loves me
THE DJINN

(in Ottoman Turkish)
Guilten He is dead He’s dead

Her knees buckle She is struck silent
THE DJINN eases off - afraid she will collapse
She BACKS AWAY through an open DOOR which she BOLTS SHUT
THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)

All who cherish him are dead
Hurrem is coming for you

THE DJINN pleads with her from HIS SIDE of the door

WE ARE IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
He is on his feet - his back to ALITHEA - calling out as if to Gilten
THE DJINN
MAKE A WISH
Save yourself Gulten
He takes a furtive glance at ALITHEA
Is the story having an effect

Yes She is RIVETED

BACK - FIVE CENTURIES EARLIER

IN THE SECRET BATHROOM
THE DJINN listens
But there is only SILENCE
THE DJINN (VO)
A few words and she could have been free
to bear her child in safety
and I to spirit away - at last -
to the Realm of Djinn

He twists the handle effortlessly breaking the heavy bolt
The DOOR SWINGS OPEN
He glimpses GULTEN at the far end of a long dank tunnel
She is RUNNING AWAY
THE DJINN charges after her

NOW

AT A SUDDEN TURN IN THE CORRIDOR
THE DJINN has caught up to GULTEN and is about to grab her when
She CRASHES into a PACK of LEATHER-CLAD ASSASSINS
THE DJINN (VO)
But she ran into the hands of The Assassins
was about to take them by force

They throw a SACK over her

One of the ASSASSIN’S moves directly into THE DJINN’S path and by the intensity
of his glare forces him to stop

THE DJINN (VO)
when was blocked by a Follower of Iblis

In a manner that is beyond reasonthis ‘ASSASSIN’ TILTS 180 degrees so that he is
now hanging from the ceiling UPSIDE-DOWN like a BAT

IN THE NEXT INSTANTHe is no longer human but a SMALL SHRIVELLED
CREATURE with the MANY EYES of a spider and mottled reptilian skin

The DAEMON IFRIT drops to the ground Standing smaller than a house cat its limbs
articulate like an insect’s Its tentacles - writhing gelatinous self-sodomizing

THE DJINN cowers - TERRIFIED to his core
JUST BEYOND

He can see the EXECUTIONERS bundle a STRUGGLING GULTEN into a SACK and
carry her off

The IFRIT speaks in a series of clicking sounds tongue inflections and claps - like a
demented cricket

THE IFRIT
(Subtitled in English)

You are not wanted here Djinn
You cannot change her story
If she does not wish
you are doomed

CLOSE ON ALITHEA
As if she is witnessing this Then
AVERY FAST - JOLTING - PULL BACK from the Agatha Christie room

Into DARKNESS

THE PALACE WALLS

The EXECUTIONERS carry THE SACK containing GULTEN to the BASTION of the
fortress - the night sky above the moonlit sea below

They HURL HER over the high wall and into the Bosphorus

THE DJINN

ls hunched frozen in pain

The IFRIT - FOLLOWER OF IBLIS - snarls contemptuously
After a long moment when all is silent and still

This phantasmagorical creature BURSTS - like the swollen egg sac of a mother
Spider

Disgorging THOUSANDS of SPIDERLINGS who scramble in a thousand directions
into the darkness of the tunnel

This releases THE DJINN who

RUSHES down the warren of tunnels to

THE CLIFF EDGE

THE DJINN
GULTEN

He LEAPS OFF the FORTRESS WALL His black cloak slips off his back and billows
awayas he torpedoes into the sea

CAMERA LINGERS on the MIST drifting across the WATER

CUT TO
THE EMPTY SACK gliding past CAMERA

As THE DJINN hauls GULTEN back to the surface

ON THE ROCKS BELOW THE FORTRESS WALL
THE DJINN cradles the DEAD GULTEN in his arms

THE DJINN (VO)

She made no wish to save herself
No wish was made - to save us both

It takes time but we notice
THE DJINN is FADING AWAY
His image TENUOUSa NEGATIVE SPACE in the mist Soon
HE IS INVISIBLE

Leaving the sodden arched CORPSE of GULTEN - ALONE ON THE ROCKS

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
Over ALITHEAS shoulder on THE DJINN as he turns to her

THE DJINN
So there was - or there was not you might say
Almost emancipated Tethered to this world
by a third wish unperformed

ALITHEA remains still Processing what she’s heard

Then
ALITHEA
You realise don’t you -
that youve just told me a story of a woman
who was doomed as a consequence of the wishes she made

THE DJINN
Yes But her failure to complete the wishes
also doomed me

ALITHEA
Could nobody else complete the wish

He sits on the bed
THE DJINN
(calmly)
That was my hope

ALITHEA
And that would finally liberate you

THE DJINN
It was my only hope

ALITHEA
But you were rendered invisible

THE DJINN
Like a ghost wandering unseen

IN THE SECRET BATHROOM

ALITHEA (VO)
And your bottle lay hidden under the loosened stone
known only to the dead Gilten

We linger on the BULLNOSE TILE Impenetrable

THE DJINN (VO)
Yes It was a predicament

IN A LABYRINTH OF CORRIDORS
THE CAMERA IS THE UNSEEN DJINN’S POINT-OF-VIEW
It LOOMS TALL as it FOLLOWS various inhabitants of the Seraglio
THE DJINN (VO)
tried to attract the attention of someone
anyone who might help me
CAMERA approaches
A KITCHEN HAND carrying a slab of meat

As the DJINN’S POV gets closer it is repelled - like a magnet bouncing off another of
the same polarity

The CAMERA is thrown backwards through the CORRIDOR WALL and then

THROUGH the BODY and ARMOUR of a JANISSARY standing guard outside
44

The JANISSARY is ENTIRELY UNAWARE of the DJINN’S PRESENCE

THE DJINN (VO)
My stars how tried

NEXT
‘He’ RUSHES towards a CONCUBINE bathing in the IMPERIAL HAREM

Again he passes frictionless THROUGH the BODY and INTO the WATER without
making a splash

THE DJINN (VO)
follow their scent their every step
Willing Pleading Screaming
Anything to draw them to me

NOW

The DJINN’S POV is frenetic It hones in on a Zaouli-style DANCER To the rapid-fire
beat of his DRUMMERS - his legs pound a tray of coloured dust at his feet

We SURGE directly into the Dancer’s MASKED FACE
Which seems to morph - briefly melting around us - ELUDING us
We have passed RIGHT THROUGH HIM and turn to look at the back of his head

Like all the others he is oblivious as he dances away from us OUT OF the PLANE of
FOCUS

ABIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF THE SERAGLIO
THE DJINN (VO)

And do this piteously for one hundred years
With every failure my will begins to fade

THE DJINN’S POINT-OF-VIEW

IS BLURRY NOW and the SOUNDS MUFFLED as we approach and pass by the
various INCUMBENTS of the COURT

And there - in all the blur - we glimpse a SHARPNESS in the image
It is a CHILD - SCAMPERING in and out of the crowd

THE DUJINN (VO)
Then in 1620 hope comes in the form
of a boy with a sword

THE DJINN’S POINT-OF-VIEW follows
THE BOY - MURAD seven years old - through the IMPERIAL BATHS and
INTO A CORRIDOR

Suddenly MURAD stops and

Turns to LOOK AT CAMERA

WE SURGE through him The boy’s face MELTS around us

We come out the other side and unlike the futile attempts of the past -
He SENSES the PRESENCE of THE DJINN

He turns towards us waving his sword like a blind man with a white cane
As THE DJINN’S POINT-OF-VIEW backs awaydown the corridor
THE BOY FOLLOWS leaving behind his playmates - their image blurred
With increasing urgency CAMERA LEADS THE BOY through

THE LABYRINTH OF CORRIDORS

Now

HE IS RUNNING TOWARDS US - trying to keep pace

THE DJINN (VO)
By some means this boy senses me
and am able to draw him to the stone

THE DJINN’S POINT-OF-VIEW ascends a narrow stairwell and passes backwards
through A DOOR as it melts momentarily around us

And WE WAIT - on the other side - near the BULLNOSE TILE

THE SECRET BATHROOM

IS NOW IN FOCUS AND THE CAMERA IS NO LONGER SUBJECTIVE

The LATCH turns The door opens blowing away dead leaves

MURAD enters the room which has been undisturbed for one hundred years
Agitated by a gnawing sense of purpose he drags his sword across the marble
When it crosses the BULLNOSE it makes a different sound

MURAD stops

He stares at the slab

Without knowing why he has a compulsion to expose what’s underneath

Wrapping his small fingers under the bullnose he tries to lift it - but it’s too heavy -
even for a strong seven-year-old

He wedges his sword in the back end of THE MARBLE SLAB and attempts to lever it
open

As he struggles he yells for someone

MURAD
IBRAHIM

THE SLAB will not budge He runs off leaving the sword jammed upright
Moments pass
MURAD returns dragging his hefty younger brother IBRAHIM (five years old)

Together they push against the sword DISLODGING THE SLAB THE TINIEST
DEGREE

That’s when we hear the voice of a woman

WOMAN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Murad Ibrahim

THE DJINN (VO)
And just as I’m about to be delivered into their hands
their mother finds them

KOSEM
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Come away from here

THE DJINN (VO)
She is Késem widow of the Sultan Ahmed the First
And the boys are next in line for the throne
IBRAHIM runs to his mother while MURAD defiantly retrieves his sword
KOSEM tries to grab him but MURAD struggles free of his long robe and runs off -
REVEALING the patterned glade of THICK HAIR on his LEGS
THE DJINN (VO)
When see the hair on his legs know that somewhere

in Murad’s bloodline pulses the power of a Djinn
follow him everywhere determined to draw him back to the stone

TOPKAPI PALACE

MURAD - older again - swaggers into the THRONE ROOM Both the SULTAN’S
CROWN and his SWORD are far too big for him

THE DJINN (VO)
But at the age of eleven
he ascends the throne as Sultan Murad IV
And caught up by the usual intrigues
he is even more lost to me

ON THE BATTLEFIELD

MURAD a man now A GENERAL - hardened and fearsome

THE DJINN (VO)
At twenty he leads his armies to war

He MANIACALLY LEAPS from HORSE TO HORSE as he swings his wide-blade
SWORD with BRUTAL EFFECT

THE DJINN (VO)
He battles alongside his men
in the Caucasus and Mesopotamia
Stories are told of his recklessness - even with his own life -
despair of ever seeing him again

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
THE DJINN searches ALITHEA’S face for any sign of empathy

THE DJINN
Hope is a monster Alithea
And am its plaything

ALITHEA
So he died

THE DJINN
Not in battle

ALITHEA is intrigued

THE DJINN
Back in Istanbul K6sem
has to protect the throne
She has to protect Ibrahim

ALITHEA
The little brother

THE DJINN
Yes

KOSEM WATCHES

IBRAHIM (now 18 years old) naked and hesitant - being led into a PLEASURE
DOME

THE DJINN (VO)

He is last of the Ottoman Line
He has to produce male children
So Késem locks him in a cage
lined entirely with sable

Two slender CONCUBINES drape IBRAHIM in an VOLUMINOUS SABLE CLOAK

It causes him to grin blissfully

ALITHEA (VO)
Quite the prison

THE DJINN (VO)
One he would never want to leave

KOSEM bolts the door

THE DJINN (VO)
It debauches him Royally

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN (VO)
He believes the greater the expanse of flesh
the more intense the pleasure

IN THE GOLDEN CAGE

IBRAHIM inspects a LINE of CORPULENT FEMALES as if they were livestock
Sniffing them prodding their flesh with a stick to measure the wobble

THE DJINN (VO)
So Késem seeks out beauties

- voluptuous and immense -
and brings them to his couch

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN
My fate turns - specifically - on this fetish

ALITHEA
How’s that

SOMEWHERE IN A CONQUERED LAND

THE DJINN (VO)
Youll see

MURAD inspects a LINE of A THOUSAND CAPTIVES All of them bound on their
knees with their necks exposed to A THOUSAND EXECUTIONERS who raise their
SWORDS and wait

NOW at the head of the line

MURAD’S terrible blade is poised above his chosen victim a thick-necked Persian
General

THEN Without mercy
MURAD IV brings down HIS SWORD

SWWOOOOSSHH

THE DOORS of the THRONE ROOM FLING OPEN

As COURTIERS of all kinds STAMPEDE to safety

When they are gone WE ENTER through the OPEN DOOR to be met with the sight of
a PASHA and an elderly VIZIER - LYING DEAD - at the foot of the throne

THE DJINN (VO)
Murad is back Though he returns a conqueror -
he cannot shed his robes of blood
War indeed has rotted his soul

MURAD panting from exertion sits on his throne Not bothering to wipe the blood
from his sword

KOSEM is the only one who hasn’t run She stands tall and very still watching her
son

THEN

She makes a subtle gesture of obeisance and backs out of the room quietly closing
the door behind her

IN THE EMPTY LABYRINTH OF CORRIDORS
WE RESUME THE DJINN’S OUT OF FOCUS POV
We hear the slow advance of a HORSE

CLIP CLOP CLIP CLOP

THE HOOVES leave bloodstains on the stone floor CAMERA rises to find MURAD
in the saddle HE alone is INFOCUS

THE DJINN (VO)

wait until he is alone
am determined to draw him back to the stone

MURAD glances back at the camera
Sensing the WILL of the INVISIBLE Djinn - just as he did as a boy

ALITHEA (VO)
don’t want to interrupt but do have a question

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
THE DJINN pauses

ALITHEA
Did it matter to you
what kind of wish such a man might make
One so insatiable

THE DJINN
No

ALITHEA
Not even if it was profoundly evil

THE DJINN
Not if it meant my freedom

THE DJINN sees that this bothers her

THE DJINN
The truth is - he has other things on his mind
He believes he’s invincible
And to rule indefinitely
he must be rid of all rivals

MURAD

TURNS AWAY and CONTINUES on his horse down the corridor

THE DOOR TO THE GOLDEN CAGE

His SWORD at the ready MURAD yanks the massive BOLT and is about to open the
door when someone STAYS HIS HAND

Its KOSEM

KOSEM
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Why waste your sword my Lion

She slides open a PEEPHOLE in the centre of the door and invites MURAD to look
inside

He observes IBRAHIM luxuriating in a Bacchanalia of OILED FLESH food and smelly
fur

KOSEM
Ibrahim

He comes to them docile and flatulent
IBRAHIM
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Big Brother
IBRAHIM reaches his filthy hand through the peephole to caress MURAD’S FACE
MURAD steps back in disgust
KOSEM
(in Ottoman Turkish)

He’s a baby
How could he ever rule

IBRAHIM grabs his mother’s breast
MURAD storms off
KOSEM watches him

She locks the peephole and bolts the door

THE DJINN (VO)
Kdésem needs to stop him
Somehow she has to distract him from his bloodlust
with other gratifications

IN THE THRONE ROOM

MURAD drains WINE from a GOBLET He tosses it into the air swings at it with his
sword and MISSES It smashes to the floor - already littered with BROKEN GLASS

THE DJINN (VO)
First she arranges for him to be perpetually drunk

Immediately ANOTHER tumbler - full to the brim - is thrust into his hand

THE DJINN (VO)
And then she tries something very shrewd

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN
Something you might enjoy

ALITHEA leans in
THE DJINN
She sends to find from all corners of the empire
the best storytellers

She acknowledges this with a faint smile

SEVEN STORYTELLERS
From different lands have assembled around the THRONE

ONE OF THEM is presenting his jocular tale Murad’s Warriors and the other
Storytellers - can’t stop laughing

But not MURAD He is glaring agitatedchipping at the floor with the point of his
sword

THE DJINN (VO)
Those who are not persuasive

IN A TINY BOAT
Another HAPLESS STORYTELLER is rowing frantically across the Bosphorus

THE DJINN (VO)
flee in fear or fall to his impatience

TWO ARROWS have landed - one on the floor of the boat and the other in his lower
leg

FROM HIGH ON THE FORTRESS WALLS

MURAD FIRES his TURKISH BOW once more The arrow arcs across the sky and we
watch as it finds its target The STORYTELLER is DEAD

NOW

THE THRONE ROOM IS EMPTY BUT FOR
MURAD and the LAST REMAINING STORYTELER - an OLD MAN

THE DJINN (VO)
There is only one who has the ability to enchant him
To soothe with stories
To hold him hostage to their unfolding

For the first time we see MURAD without a sword in his hand He is reclining on his
THRONE with eyes closed

The OLD STORYTELLER builds to the climax of this night’s ‘episode’ And
MURAD bursts into LAUGHTER

The OLD STORYTELLER smiles back at him

OUTSIDE THE DOORS TO THE THRONE ROOM

The Warriors the Courtiers the Grand Vizier and KOSEM are waiting Closed-out
Listening to the laughter

INSIDE THE THRONE ROOM

Propped up against a column

We find MURAD’S SWORD

It is heavily rusted and being COBWEBBED by a small spider

THE DJINN (VO)
This is his only friend
And that friendship turns to love

MURAD is on the floor at the OLD STORYTELLER’S feet looking up at him
Spellbound Drunk
THE DJINN (VO)
Since there is nothing else for me to do

listen gratefully
For I too love being lost in his stories

AN OLDER MURAD

Dissipated shrunken and jaundiced yellow - he looks decades older than his twenty-
seven years

THE DJINN (VO)
When the old man dies
all in the palace flee to the streets
For they fear Murad’s grief will incur fresh murder
But he just sits and howls and drinks
He is keening over the CORPSE of the OLD STORYTELLER

THE DJINN (VO)
until he is empty

THE DJINN’S SUBJECTIVE POINT-OF-VIEW
THE DJINN (VO)
And my patience is rewarded
For in this state
am finally able to draw him back
to the secret bathroom

The wildly swaying silhouette of MURAD approaches His ATAXIC GAIT is so severe
he can barely hold himself upright

Nevertheless he follows the CAMERA urgently down the corridor which leads to
THE SECRET BATHROOM

As before we PASS BACKWARDS through the DOOR as it melts momentarily around
US

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA
know where this is going

THE DJINN looks at her

ALITHEA
He is too weak to lift the stone

THE DJINN
Too weak even to turn the latch

INSIDE THE SECRET BATHROOM
For a few moments THE DOOR LATCH jiggles feebly
Then stops

THE DJINN (VO)
So he leavesand drinks himself
to permanent sleep

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

This is not what she expected
ALITHEA
Oh

THE DJINN
And there am left to my own oblivion
With no one to hear my voice
No one to know me Nor feel me Nor sense me

He lets it sink in

THE DJINN
You can’t imagine

He eases closer to herslowlyimperceptibly

ALITHEA
Actually can

THE DJINN
Can you imagine the loneliness
How it might overwhelm

ALITHEA
(quietly)
I can

THE DJINN
We exist only if we are real to others
(Fixing his gaze on her)
Do you agree

ALITHEA is mesmerized

ALITHEA
do

THE DJINN
This then is our fate
if you make no wish at all
will be caught between worlds
Invisible and alone for all of time

He leans in
THE DJINN
(softly)
Make a wish Alithea
Make it your heart’s desire
She is utterly still Spellbound
THE DJINN is alive with anticipation

ALITHEA
Id be more careful if were you

On his look

ALITHEA
Obviously you managed to find your way out

This takes the wind out of his sails

THE DJINN
More or less

ALITHEA
I’m inclined to think I’m in the presence of a trickster

He shies back
THE DJINN
That would be so much better
My work would be so much easier
But the truth is am just an idiot
who has been extravagantly unlucky

ALITHEA
Ill have to take your word for that

They glare at each other It’s a stand-off

ALITHEA
So Ibrahim suppose becomes Sultan

He shrugs

IBRAHIM IS HAULED WHIMPERING
From the FETID DARKNESS of the GOLDEN CAGE

THE DJINN (VO)
Ibrahim has to be dragged to the throne

This sorry mess is overseen by KOSEM

She is now the EFFECTIVE RULER of the OTTOMAN EMPIRE

VALIDE SULTAN KOSEM WATCHES THROUGH A GILDED SCREEN AS

IBRHIM in full Sultanic regalia - sits on THE THRONE - cushioned by his PLUMPEST
CONCUBINES

He looks UTTERLY BEFUDDLED

THE DJINN (VO)
He appoints one of his concubines
Governor of Damascus

THE LARGEST and FLESHIEST OF HIS CONCUBINES

Makes her way down the labyrinth of corridors

THE DJINN (VO)
Her name is ‘Sugar Lump’
By every measure his favourite
And had she not been free to roam

IN THE SECRET BATHROOM

THE DJINN (VO)
She would not have found the secret bathroom

SEKERPARE - ‘SUGAR LUMP’ soaks in the bath
THE DJINN (VO)
And had she not decided to take a bath
it would not have overfilled
WATER spills out of the bathing pool onto the marble
THE DJINN (VO)
And had she not been careless
as she made her way across the floor

She heaves her frame out of the bathing pool and takes a few LUMBERING STEPS
towards us

THE DJINN (VO)
She would not have slipped

Her LEGS SLIDE from underneath her

THE DJINN (VO)
Smashed the stone

As she lands the SHOCKWAVES FRACTURE the BULLNOSE TILE

THE DJINN (VO)
and found my bottle

ON ALITHEA

ALITHEA
Aah

BACK IN THE SECRET BATHROOM

SUGAR LUMP extracts the BRASS BOTTLE from her rump Baffled she scrutinises
this unexpected object Then

In a reversal of the moment we last saw him (fading into invisibility upon Guilten’s
death)

THE DJINN EMERGES IN THE BATHROOM STEAM BEHIND HER

First as a negative shapethen FULLY PRESENT

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN
To tell the truth should have been more dignified
But began to beg shamelessly

IN THE SECRET BATHROOM
SUGAR LUMP gets to her feet GAPING UP AT HIM

THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Please fine lady -
my situation is grave It’s desperate
You must help me

SUGAR LUMP
(in Ottoman Turkish)
You smell

THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Wish Wish for anything
Wish for everything

SUGAR LUMP
(in Ottoman Turkish)
want nothing to do with devious Djinn

This is more than petulance It is a deep loathing

THE DJINN
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Anything you hanker for There must be
Wish it Speak it Tell me
NOW

SUGAR LUMP
(in Ottoman Turkish)
WISH YOU WERE BACK IN YOUR BOTTLE
AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BOSPHORUS

DEEP UNDER WATER

FISH SCATTER to reveal THE BOTTLE stranded on the SEA FLOOR

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
He looks at ALITHEA

THE DJINN
“ wish you were backin your bottle
at the bottom of the Bosphorus”
(deferentially)
So here am - fallen into your careful hands
ALITHEA
(irritated)
Seems we cannot escape each other

THE DJINN
You have me at your mercy

ALITHEA
This wishing is a hazardous art
‘ wish’ brings infinite unravellings

THE DJINN
Not necessarily

She stands up

ALITHEA
It’s there in all your own stories

THE DJINN
know but -

She’s pacing now

ALITHEA
You say you’re not a trickster
You say you and are the authors of this story
but I’m unable to write myself out of it

THE DJINN
Correct

Alithea has lost patience with him If he is a CREATURE of EMOTION she is a
CREATURE of REASON

ALITHEA
Why don’t you just hop back into your bottle
and Ill give it to someone more gullible
someone more desperate more greedy

THE DJINN
I’m not getting back in the bottle

ALITHEA
Why not

THE DJINN
I’m not getting back in the bottle

ALITHEA
Well am not making three wishes

THE DJINN
Then you’re sending me to my oblivion

ALITHEA
You’re impossible

THE DJINN
And you are giving me a headache

ALITHEA
Alright Here’s what Ill do

She takes a deep breath

ALITHEA
will make three wishes

THE DJINN
(sceptical)
Before you die

ALITHEA
Right now One after the other
Ready Number one -
wish your headache were gone

She scans his face for a sign of relief
He stares at her Blankly
She reaches for her tea cup

ALITHEA
Number two wish for a sip of this tea

She sips the tea

ALITHEA
And finally wish for another one of those

She takes a CHICKPEA BISCUIT from the bowl and pops it in her mouth
THE DJINN is seething

THE DJINN
You mock me

ALITHEA
(what’s the problem)
Three wishes Perfectly simple
And theoreticallysafe

THE DJINN
was imprisoned by Solomon
precisely because cried out my heart’s desire
Only by granting you yours can earn my release

ALITHEA
appreciate the symmetry
But cannot - for the life of me -
summon up one eligible wish
And you are demanding three

He’s had enough
THE DJINN
Is there any life in you
Are you even alive

He stands looming over her

ALITHEA
(unfazed)
You know in some cultures
absence of desire means enlightenment

THE DJINN
Then you are a pious fool

She glares at him

ALITHEA
If Im content why tempt fate

THE DJINN
And you’re a coward

ALITHEA
Don’t goad me

THE DJINN
(infuriated)
There is no Human no Angel nor Djinn
who wouldn’t grasp the chance
to fulfil their deepest longings
and am saddled with the one
who claims to want nothing at all
Alithea Binnie you are a liar

ALITHEA
You know I’m beginning to wish we’d never met

He FLINCHES
THE DJINN
No No Non NYET
Don’t say that

With each word his body distorts This time the Djinn-glitch is so SEVERE
The TV and lights flicker and Cesm-i bulbul bottle in Alithea’s hand EXPLODES
We may notice a SMALL CUT on her cheek - in the shape of an Arabic numeral ‘3’
ALITHEA is surprised by level of his PANIC
His breathing slows
ALITHEA
So that’s happened to you before

And it was bad

He looks at her

THE DJINN
It was bad It was bitter
It was the cruellest wish of all

ALITHEA

You were undone by silliness
Yet again

THE DJINN
I’m here

He points to the shards of the CESM-I BULBUL BOTTLE on the floor

THE DJINN
because of a genius

ALITHEA
Who was it this time

THE DJINN
She was Zefir

He begins to gather SHARDS of the broken bottle in his hand
THE DJINN
Rarely among humankind
has there been such a wonder

ALITHEA
But you’re here as a result of her folly

THE DJINN
ended up in this as a consequence of Zefir

ALITHEA

And this is the story you’ve been avoiding telling me all along

THE DJINN
This is the story I’ve avoided telling even myself

A CARD APPEARS
“THE CONSEQUENCE OF ZEFIR”
BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA holds up a finger gesturing ‘Wait’

She grabs the bowl of CHICKPEA BISCUITS from the tray and sits on the bed

About to eat them - like popcorn

She is ready

IT IS THE 1850’s - TURKEY
RIDING IN A HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE

We find a passenger a WOMAN in a NIQAB covering everything but her HAUNTED
EYES

ZEFIR looking at the world passing outside

THE DJINN (VO)
Zefir was a foundling
Married at twelve to a wealthy merchant

Pull back to reveal THE MERCHANT next to her - an old man in an expensively
tailored suit

THE DJINN (VO)
He was much older than she and kind enough
if you think keeping someone like a bird in a cage is kind
In the seat opposite are two more WIVES shrouded in niqab staring at ZEFIR

THE DUJINN (VO)
There were two older wives who didn’t like her
and didn’t talk to her at all

A SPECTACULAR WOODEN MANSION ON THE BOSPHORUS STRAIT

White and ornate

The CARRIAGE pulls up at the entrance

The OLD MERCHANT is helped out followed by the THREE WIVES who hurry along
3 CANOPIED WALKWAY which hides them from public gaze until they enter the front

IN THE OPULENT ENTRANCE HALL

ZEFIR grabs a tray of food from the hands of a waiting SERVANT and storms up the
stairs

She is watched by the HOUSE STAFF and the OTHER WIVES

THE DJINN (VO)
Everyone including the servants seemed to be mocking her
She had neither etiquette nor learning
She grew to no great beauty

ZEFIR is now at the TOP FLOOR and opens the door to
HER LOFT

She enters BOLTS the internal locks and VIOLENTLY DISROBES tossing aside her
nigab in a rage

THE DJINN (VO)
And she was angry without knowing why

HOLD ON HER FACE as she comes up for air - trying to calm her breath

LIGHT streams in from one high dormer window - the only window into her UNIQUE
‘CAGE’ from which she cannot see out or be seen

THE DJINN (VO)
As the fates would have it

A LARGE FISH IS CUT OPEN

The DJINN’S BRASS BOTTLE spills out GLEAMING - cleaned by the acids of the
gut

THE COOK holds it up surprised

The OLD MERCHANT nearby fastidiously inspecting his KITCHEN - approaches for a
closer look

IN ZEFIR’S LOFT - EVENING
THE DJINN (VO)
My bottle came to her as a love-token
from her husband
The OLD MERCHANT undresses as he watches his YOUNG WIFE unwrap her gift
THE DJINN’S BRASS BOTTLE

ZEFIR nods cursorily and goes to her COLLECTION of at least one hundred FLASKS
and JARS - most of them GLASS

She places THE BRASS BOTTLE among them

THE DJINN (VO)
When she had finished satisfying him and was finally alone

LATER THAT NIGHT

She takes a CARVING CHISEL from her toolbox picks up the BOTTLE and chips
away at the seal

THE DJINN (VO)
she managed to prise it open

As The MAKINGS of THE DJINN blasts from the bottle CAMERA pulls back to
illustrate the process Each stage is

ANIMATED AS IF FROM A JOURNAL IN SEPIA INK
First an arrow indicates the mouth of the bottle and the following description

Stage 1
Electromagnetic waves

Then

Stage 2
Vapour

Stage 3
Organic particles

Stage 4
The formation of organs

Now we see

THE EXTERIOR OF THE MERCHANT’S MANSION

We favour the CORNER TURRET on the TOP FLOOR

ZEFIR’S LOFT ABOVE THE WATER

Our view is largely obscured by SHUTTERED WINDOWS but - by the play of light

and the sound of THRUMMING - we sense THE DJINN EMERGING FULLY from the
BOTTLE

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
ALITHEA leans forward taking this in
THE DJINN
It was as if she was waiting for me
saw at once that she was sharp
She saw that was desperate
for freedom and conversation
told her my story as have told you
THE DJINN’S eyes are on ALITHEA
THE DJINN
And she revealed herself to me
by the things she had made
BACK IN ZEFIR’S LOFT - MORNING
It is full of intriguing clutter Her room is a haphazard museum of a lonely life
We are looking at INTRICATE EMBROIDERIES

They depict a SHAH and his quest for flight - by means of FOUR HUNGRY EAGLES
tethered above his THRONE Lumps of MEAT dangling above them

As THE DJINN admires the brilliance of her craft ZEFIR invites him to look into an
INGENIOUS ANIMATION DEVICE she has invented

It is a 19th Century version of a GIF

She turns a geared handle and the embroidered EAGLES LIFT THE SHAH into the
AIR Over and over

THE DJINN laughs with DELIGHT
And ZEFIR delights in his pleasure
NOW

She UNDRAPES a small-scale model of an experimental FLYING MACHINE -
an AIRSCREW made of cloth and wood

THE DJINN (VO)
She could have been remembered like the genius da Vinci
whose theories of flight were the talk of Sultans and Kings
She was a great artist but no one saw her art

She turns a spindle and THE BLADES ROTATE creating enough energy to LAUNCH
IT high into the vaulted loft

When it descends THE DJINN ‘hovers’ the AIRSCREW above his palm - gently
returning it to ZEFIR

WIDE SHOT
THE DJINN listens to ZEFIR as she paces agitated like a caged animal

THE DJINN (VO)
She told me she was eaten up with unused power
She thought she might be a witch -
except she said if she were a man
her intellect would have been ordinarily accepted

As she voices her frustration she rhythmically whacks her hand with the Airscrew -
then tosses it aside

THE DUJINN (VO)
She was a woman ardent for learning
and knew what her first wish would be

ZEFIR her eyes glistening with hope
ZEFIR
(in Ottoman Turkish)
want knowledge

wish to acquire all knowledge
that is useful beautiful and true

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN
And it delighted me to fulfill this wish

The insinuation is not lost on ALITHEA

AN ARABIC MANUSCRIPT - NIGHT

ZEFIR’S FINGERS glide across THE PAGE After little more than a second she flips
to the next

HER EYES DART Her leg jiggles with nervous energy as she READS with
STARTLING RAPIDITY - like Alithea did at the beginning of this story

THE DJINN (VO)
So taught her histories philosophies
languages and poetry

A COMPLEX GEOMETRICAL DIAGRAM - DAY

ZEFIR is studying Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion Using a compass and stylus
she is drawing the Earth’s elliptical orbit around the sun

THE DJINN (VO)
taught her astronomy and mathematics
which was bliss to her

While ZEFIR focuses intensely on her work THE DJINN serves her a tray laden with
DELICACIES He is happy

NOW

THE DJINN (VO)
brought her books and writings
Which we hid in her collection of bottles

He places a RED GLASS BOTTLE on a silver tray and invites her to TAP IT LIGHTLY
THE BOTTLE seems to ‘melt’ into countless tiny beads spreading thin across the tray
like mercury

ZEFIR carefully places a well-loved BOOK in the centre of the tray The tiny beads
REGROUP rapidly and ENVELOP the book in glass

She whispers a single mysterious word (Sheeba) and - just like that - the RED
BOTTLE is reformed sealed with the book trapped inside

ZEFIR SMILES
CAMERA RISES ABOVE ZEFIR AND THE DJINN

THE DJINN (VO)
She could always call on Aristotle from the red glass jar
or Euclid from the green
Pythagoras or Spinoza
without needing me to re-embody them

They are in vibrant conversation surrounded by these COUNTLESS BOTTLES of
auspicious content

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
The memory surges through him
THE DJINN
We had the whole world in her room
And lost my heart to her
Hold ALITHEAHer larynxA little gulp

THE DJINN
It was my bliss to make her happy
To see her flourish

Then

ANOTHER BOTTLE

is placed in the COLLECTION An offering from her HUSBAND

It is the UNMELTED pristine CESM-I BULBUL- The Nightingale’s Eye
CLOSE on ZEFIR’S SULLEN FACE

THE DJINN (VO)
And she flourished in every way
Totalmente

The OLD MERCHANT in his night shirt stands directly behind her He bends her over
the bed face-down

He unbuttons a MODESTY FLAP at the back of her night dress exposing her bottom

THE DJINN (VO)
She began to rebel even against

the gestures of submission

that her husband required
To give him height he steps onto a FOOT STOOL
HIS FEET are disfigured with GOUT and his TOENAILS GNARLED and deathly
THE OLD MERCHANT mounts her like a sad donkey
HOLD ON THE OLD MAN’S FACE pained with effort

THE DJINN (VO)
For she acquired a mastery of love-craft

Suddenly he GASPS Something she’s doing gives him an INTENSE SENSATION
A thrill

THE DJINN (VO)
out of reach of any human
who had not made love with a Djinn
He finds himself being PUSHED BACK onto a CHAIR stacked with books
ZEFIR straddles him

As his HANDS splay out reaching for HER FACE we see the GREY HAIR on his
forearms standing on end electrified

His HEAD JOLTS BACK and his ARMS SPREAD Christ-like Ecstatic He cries out
OVERWHELMED WITH PLEASURE

NOW

They are at THE DOOR

OLD MERCHANT
(in Ottoman Turkish)
Are you happy

ZEFIR shoves him out Then
Grabs his cane hands it to him - and in exchange - takes his PINCE-NEZ
She shuts the door bolting the locks

CLANK CLACK

IN THE HALL OUTSIDE
THE OLD MAN is left STUPEFIED - a whimpering zombie in a nightshirt

He looks down at his groin then turns backCLAWING at HER DOOR Wanting
more

THE DJINN (VO)
His craving for her became
an obsession

SPECTACULAR CUMULUS CLOUDS

THE DJINN (VO)
And when he would come to her
would leave her room and journey the sky

VIEWED THROUGH ZEFIR’S OPEN WINDOW

THE DJINN (VO)
saw the oceans and the mountains
and the beasts of the forest where no man treads

PULL BACK to find

THE DJINN CRADLING ZEFIR IN HIS ARMS He is caressing her FACE languid and
pale

THE DJINN (VO)
And when would return
she would be waiting for me
would tell her of my day and she would faint

with joy and disappointment
BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA
Why didn’t she make a wish to break free

THE DJINN
There was something more important to her
She had devised a ‘Mathematica’
a language to explain the forces which bring space and time
and matter into being

BACK IN ZEFIR’S ROOM NIGHT
STREWN with PAPERS on which she has written endless ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS
We find her at the table muttering SCRIBBLING feverishly
THE DJINN (VO)
She was Promethean Brave
But she could not solve this puzzle
HER INK-SPLATTERED PAGE
Crammed with wild ALGEBRAIC SEQUENCES - flowing from her pen She STOPS
ABRUPTLY and CROSSES OUT her most recent calculation She has come to a
DEAD END She sinks to the floor foetal-like
When THE DJINN puts a consoling hand on her shoulder she shrugs him off
THE DJINN (VO)
She needed a key A key to open
the doors of her perception
BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
The afternoon light plays on HIS WISTFUL FACE
THE DJINN
So she used her second wish
taught her to dream as Djinn do Awake
NOW
THE INK SPLATTERED PAGE fades away but the CALCULATIONS REMAIN
suspendedFLOATING IN SPACE It’s hard to tell whether we are at the level of
electrons or vast galaxies
Yet what we are seeing is what unifies them - MATHEMATICS
THE DJINN (VO)
And in this way the solutions came to her
She was able to explain powers invisible
We are moving through PLANES of Geometry Calculus and Abstract Algebra -
variations of the CELEBRATED EQUATIONS of Newton Maxwell and Einstein
AGAININ THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM
On ALITHEA caught up in THE DJINN’S recollections

THE DJINN
electromagnetic fields and forces
The very stuff of which the Djinn are made

To demonstrate this he wriggles his fingers and a VAPOUR - BLACK RED
and SHIMMERING - emanates from their tips
ALITHEA
You are electromagnetic

THE DJINN
As you are dust
am Subtle Fire
And when she was to bear a child
was plagued with happiness
For knew it would strengthen us

ALITHEA
She was carrying your child

THE DJINN
Acchild of fire and dust

ALITHEA
So where did it go wrong

THE DJINN
Alithea loved her
loved the fervour of her mind
loved her anger
loved my power to turn her frowns into smiles
loved her more than Sheba

ALITHEA
More than your freedom
THE DJINN
Yes
This is quite a confession
He goes further
THE DJINN

It became my greatest desire to keep her
To remain her prisoner
The thought of being set loose sickened my heart

ABRUPTLY
THE DJINN (VO)
caught myself stopping her

THE DJINN puts his fingers to ZEFIR’S LIPS

THE DJINN (VO)
lest she make her third wish

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

ALITHEA is taken aback
ALITHEA
Oh gosh

THE DJINN
made a mess of it
She began to accuse me of trapping her
like her husband

IN ZEFIR’S LOFT

THE DJINN ‘melts’ the CESM-I BULBUL and places HIS HAND in the ‘mercury’ of tiny
beads As he is ENVELOPED he VAPORISES and scintillates like a heat haze

As the BOTTLE REASSEMBLES he is SWEPT INTO IT

THE DJINN (VO)
tried to make amends To atone
would put myself in the bottle To be sealed
That way she could have power over me

BACK IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

He holds back tears

THE DJINN
To be nothing in a bottle
could do that for her

ALITHEA’s eyes moisten in response
THE DJINN
And every time it would appease her

Every time except the last when
like a sudden squall all thunder and lightning

ZEFIR’S RAGE BUILDS
She TURNS HER BACK on the CESM- BULBUL BOTTLE

THE DJINN (VO)
She began to weep and rail and said

ZEFIR
(in Turkish)
wish I could forget ever met you

IN THE AGATHA CHRISTIE ROOM

THE DJINN

And she did - on the instant
She was out was in and she had forgotten me

THE DJINN turns awayin despair
ALITHEA feels for him keenly

THE DJINN
Alithea How can it be a mistake
to love someone entirely

His gaze drifts away

He is heartbroken Human

Then
ALITHEA
have a wish
THE DJINN lifts his head
ALITHEA

However I’m afraid it may be too much to ask

THE DJINN
Is it within my power

ALITHEA
hope so Oh do hope so

He looks at her Her hand is shaking

THE DJINN
Is it your heart’s desire

ALITHEA
am certain of it

He waits motionless

ALITHEA
am here to love you

Alithea inhales
ALITHEA
And wish for you to love me in return

THE DJINN is processing this Uncertain

THE DJINN
You want us to make love-craft

ALITHEA
Yeah that too All of it

THE DJINN
And you would abandon yourself to this

ALITHEA
Yes Yes want our solitudes to be together
want that love professed in ageless tales

She is no longer just a creature of reason

ALITHEA
want that longing you felt for the Queen of Sheba
and that love you gave to your genius Zefir
want it

THE DJINN’S response is a long and hesitant pause

THE DJINN
You give and you bind
(Djinnbish)
Me

ALITHEA
You

THE DJINN
You

ALITHEA
Me
Is it too much
Is it all too much to ask

ALITHEA’S EYES are alive with courage as he LIFTS her to meet his upturned face
They ‘melt’ into each other

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
What are we to do with longing awoken

How can 1 persuade you that J once found love with a Djinn
‘In any case few would believe me

CAMERA pivots away from them and begins to PAN slowly around THE ROOM

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
Love ts not something we come to by reason

It’s more like a vapour

A dream perhaps
To lure us into the enchantment of our own stortes
of that’s so how are we to know if it’s ever real

Js it a truth or simply a madness

The play of light on the WALLS suggests that time is ACCELERATING

As we reach the WINDOWS the clouds become stars The day becomes night
Then it is day again

Now THE ROOM seems to PULSE with a delicate SHIMMERING TREMOR

The CAMERA CONTINUES its pan and - distorted in the MIRROR opposite the bed -
we glimpse slivers of their intimacy Writhing shapes and colours incandescent

When CAMERA finally comes to rest on The Lovers again ALITHEA is FACING US
CRADLED by THE DJINN The lower half of his body seems to be COILED through
her legs and around her like a great python Glistening blue-black

As we push in ALITHEA is given to intermittent tremblings - aftershocks

She looks DIRECTLY AT CAMERA Her EYES are blood-red orbs with irises the
colour of malachite Then

As she mellowswith each breaththey become NORMAL

FADE TO BLACK

ALITHEA’S SLEEPING FACE

We are CLOSE ENOUGH to see the RAPID EYE MOVEMENTS behind her LIDS
EASE BACK as she slowly emerges from a deep hibernation

She is AWASH with SUNLIGHT and the SOUNDS of ISTANBUL - traffic the voices of
the street and the bustle of boats and ferries

We see that - for the first time - the BALCONY DOORS are WIDE OPEN
(The sounds and the light are now naturalistic INFERRING we are back in REALITY)
She sits up tangled in the sheets and

We notice that she is ALONE in the bed

THE BATHROOM
The bath is filling

ALITHEA is brushing her teeth

AT THE BATHROOM MIRROR
ALITHEA stops brushing her teeth
ALITHEA

leave for London today
Will you come home with me

We can barely differentiate THE DJINN’S ANSWER from the sound of the RUNNING
WATER and the ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH

She smiles

ALITHEA
Its not such an easy place nowadays
but it will be better if you’re there

She resumes brushing her teeth

(Is THE DJINN REAL or just a COMFORTING FANTASY)

AIRPORT DEPARTURE SECURITY QUEUE

ALITHEA places her shoes carry-on and laptop into trays and sends them towards
the X-RAY MACHINE

She steps through the FULL BODY SCANNER The screen reveals unknown objects
in each of her jacket pockets

A female SECURITY OFFICER beckons her
SECURITY OFFICER
Please step out
What is in your pockets

Out of one pocket ALITHEA carefully reveals a CRYSTAL BOTTLE and from the
second pocket the SCREW CAP

ALITHEA
Its an empty bottle and a top

SECURITY OFFICER
Please put through X-ray

ALITHEA
Its very delicate and don’t want it to get damaged

SECURITY OFFICER
It will not be damaged Please put it through X-ray

ALITHEA
(insistent)
prefer that it didn’t go in there
A SURLY SUPERVISOR approaches

SURLY SUPERVISOR
Passport Boarding Pass

ALITHEA hands the documents to him He checks them Then opens his hand for the
BOTTLE

ALITHEA
It’s quite fragile

He silences her Takes the BOTTLE sniffs it and holds it up to the light
Turning it this way and that

ALITHEA
It’s a salt shaker

She watches as he tips THE BOTTLE upside-down takes a PENCIL inserts it rudely
SWIZZLES it around and SHAKES it VIGOROUSLY Then

The SUPERVISOR screws the CAP back on the bottle
He is about to give it back when ALITHEA reaching out too eagerly

Causes him to withdraw it Teasing her

ALITHEA
No No X-Ray Please

ALITHEA makes one last attempt to stop the bottle going through the x-ray machine
but the SUPERVISOR blocks her way and the female GUARD puts a restraining hand
on her

The SUPERVISOR places the BOTTLE in a plastic tub and sends it THROUGH the X-
RAY MACHINE

ALITHEA gasps

The SUPERVISOR and his team scrutinize her as

The BOTTLE comes out the other side

The technician behind the x-ray screen shrugs - ‘nothing there’

ALITHEA removes the CAP from the BOTTLE glaring at the SUPERVISOR

Mindful of the large impatient QUEUE with a somewhat contemptuous wave of his
hand he sends her on her way

IN FLIGHT FROM ISTANBUL TO LONDON

We find ALITHEA sitting UTTERLY STILL in the aisle seat - her eyes fixed on the
OPEN BOTTLE cupped in her hands

A MODEST WHITE TOWNHOUSE - NUMBER 333 PRIMROSE HILL LONDON

The street is empty but for the Homeless and a Mother in a burga with a Child There
is angst-ridden graffiti on the walls

This is the Modern World in a state of unease
A taxi moves off ALITHEA stands outside her home
INSIDE

She places the OPEN MINI-BAR BOTTLE on a shelf amid her diverse COLLECTION
of GLASS OBJECTS She steps back and waits

Nothing happens
She gives the BOTTLE a little shakethen puts it back

Still nothing
ALITHEA
In your own time

The bottle it seems is just a bottle

She backs away

THE BEDROOM

She hangs her jacket in the wardrobe and we PAN her back to the SUITCASE on the
bed

As CAMERA encroaches on her BACK we become aware of a DISTINCTIVE
THRUMMING downstairs - from the room below

ALITHEA goes to the LANDING of the DOUBLE-HEIGHT ATRIUM and looks down to
catch a brief view of

HER DJINN

The sight of him fills her with pleasure
ALITHEA comes down the stairs and into the
THE IVY-WALLED COURTYARD

Where she finds him standing VERY STILL in the centre of the small garden He is
looking up into the London sky

She quietly enters his meditative space

THE DJINN
The air is thick here
Full of insistent voices and rushing faces

ALITHEA
Oh Like Tiny Einstein
Television and phone towers and such

THE DJINN
Yes all your ingenious devices
All murmuring at once
Bend your head

In profile he bows lowering his forehead close to the crown of her head

At first the sounds are faint but they BUILD RAPIDLY to a CACOPHONY Among the
news alerts police radio chatter airline pilots negotiating landing slots ringtones the
gabble of Apps the pinging of car-key remotes - we hear conversations on phones
talk-back TV and online - a rancorous multitude of politicians comedians pop stars
opinionators and the like

Until after a few short seconds it’s ALL TOO MUCH FOR ALITHEA

She pulls away
ALITHEA
You hear all that

He nodshis eyes are in a state of SHIMMERING TREMOR His skin is VAPOROUS
SCINTILLATING as if MUTED IMAGES are ROILING inside of him

THE DJINN
also see it and feel it
(making light of it)
am a ‘Transmitter’
He recovers regaining focus
ALITHEA
Isnt it all too much

THE DJINN
am a Djinn can adapt
Ill soon get used to it
THEN

From over the NEXT-DOOR FENCE another VOICE The accent is posh

OLDER WOMAN
(off screen)
She’s back believe she’s back

A refined 70-year-old elegantly dressed woman - CLEMENTINE - pokes her head
over the garden wall and peers nosily into Alithea’s yard

CLEMENTINE’S twin - FANNY - appears on their BALCONY

CLEMENTINE
Is she with someone

FANNY
(to Clementine)
think she’s talking to herself again

ALITHEA
Hello Clementine Fanny
Are you well

CLEMENTINE
Did you have any trouble

ALITHEA
Trouble What kind of trouble

FANNY
With your foreign friends

CLEMENTINE
Because we often ask ourselves
‘Why would Dr Binnie waste her time and intelligence
studying the ways of others - instead of upholding our own’

FANNY
Embarrassed by our British culture are we

ALITHEA
Nono
lam rather more likely to be embarrassed by
anybody reflexly frightened of anybody different

CLEMENTINE
What exactly are you saying

FANNY
She’s calling us bigots

ALITHEA
Your word not mine

CLEMENTINE
You misunderstand It’s not how they look dear
Its how they live What they believe

FANNY
What they eat

ALITHEA
What are you on about

CLEMENTINE
Everywhere on goes ethnics
We are being overwhelmed
and we’re inviting our doom

FANNY
It’s not natural

CLEMENTINE
Birds belong in the air And fish in the sea

FANNY
And that is how the Good Lord meant us to be

ALITHEA
Youre just spouting rubbish
from start to finish

ALITHEA glances at THE DJINNbut HE IS NOT THERE
She looks around He is gone

CLEMENTINE
It’s science
It’s a scientific fact

ALITHEA
Its a false analogy
Animals do have a natural habitat
That is true
But human beings are capable of living in
any environment they bloody-well choose

FANNY
That’s not a fact

A PLANE ROARS overhead drowning out parts of their argument

ALITHEA
What are you saying

FANNY
Its an opinion

CLEMENTINE
And you’re wrong

ALITHEA
I’m not putting up with any more of this

FANNY

Come away Clem Let the crazy lady be
We’re never going to get any sense out of her

As they huff off

ALITHEA
You know I’ve never said this to you before
But youre bothPITIFUL

CLEMENTINE
Shut your CAKE-HOLE

ALITHEA
PEA-BRAINED AND PITIFUL

CLEMENTINE
YOU FUCK-FACE Stop your IVY growing
on OUR SIDE OF THE WALL
When they have gone ALITHEA storms back
INTO THE HOUSE
And slides the glass doors SHUT

She is seething Unable to let it go

ALITHEA
Why do let them get to me
should feel sorry for them

She opens a draw grabs an ASTHMA INHALER and takes a puff

ALITHEA
This is my home It’s my sanctuary

She yells at the wall shared in common with Clementine and Fanny

THE DJINN has been observing her

ALITHEA
could wish them(she speaks Djinnbish)
That’s not a wish by the way

THE DJINN
know

As she struggles to calm herself he eases forward The closer he gets the louder the
cacophony His ‘transmitter’ as it were is turning up the volume

This time we see the EFFORT on his FACE and in his BODY as he begins to BEND
the unbearably strident SOUNDS and VOICES (including echoes of the quarrel with
Clem and Fanny) until they become more mellifluous MUSICAL Thrumming and
harmonious it recalls the music that we first heard when King Solomon serenaded the
Queen of Sheba And as they touch foreheads

We see ALITHEAS angst begin to melt away

This is the Song of Transference Not quite a lullaby nor an anthem - it is ancient
soaring and full of longing

FADE TO BLACK

THE DJINN’S MUSIC

Fills the space and continues in support of THE BRIEF VIGNETTES that follow
Through a FROSTED GLASS WALL we see UNIVERSITY types going about their
business CAMERA PULLS BACK to find ALITHEA typing at a desk in a SMALL
ROOM full of books and academic papers

Now she is in the CAFETERIA nibbling lunch and RUMINATING as she watches
the RAIN OUTSIDE

Later she is on The TUBE making her way home

It is EVENING ALITHEA is leaving the LOCAL SUPERMARKET with the day’s
shopping

She WALKS HOME in the rain-washed streets

THE MUSIC crescendos and STOPS as

ALITHEA taps the code on the KEYPAD which unlocks
THE FRONT DOOR OF HER TOWNHOUSE

ALITHEA finds THE DJINN in the dining room sitting at the table his BACK TO
CAMERA (As in the hotel room and in the time of Giilten he has found clothes appropriate
to the circumstance)

On the table sit the familiar pot of rose tea and the tray of delicacies
She embraces him from behind

ALITHEA
My Djinn

THE DJINN
How was your day

ALITHEA
Every listening ear was yours
Every voice Every scent and touch
You were everywhere
As this is spoken

We CUT TO their faces He reaches out and takes a NAN-E NOKHODCHI from the
brass bowl He nibbles it

ALITHEA’S face lights up - an inspiration
She grabs the BOWL

ALITHEA
Back in a minute

He turns to watch her as she makes for the front door

STREET EXTERIOR - PRIMROSE HILL LONDON

ALITHEA walks resolutely from her house to the NEIGHBOURS - Clementine and
Fanny

She taps the door-knocker
A RAKING SHOT
As she waits

In the background we see the PORTICO of her front door from which THE DJINN
emerges casually lifting his hoodie over his ears

At this point we hear the muffled presence of CLEM and FANNY from inside
Who is it 1 believe it’s her What does she want
CLEMENTINE opens the door FANNY is at her side

ALITHEA
Clem Fanny

She offers them the NAN-E NOKHODCHI

ALITHEA
Chickpea cloves pistachio

CLEM and FANNY look at the biscuits doubtfully
To reassure them ALITHEA picks one

ALITHEA
They will melt in your mouth

She tastes it eagerly

In response CLEM reaches out and carefully - lest it crumble in her fingers - chooses
one hands it to FANNY then takes another for herself

CLOSE on ALITHEA nodding encouragement as we see someone OUT-OF-FOCUS
approaching

CLEM is about to pop the biscuit in her mouth when
THE DJINN appears DIRECTLY BEHIND ALITHEA
Nothing on the faces of CLEM and FANNY indicates that they see him

ALITHEA however takes a momentary glance back and then addresses Clem and
Fanny

ALITHEA
This is my friend
Hell be staying for a while
CLEM and FANNY’S FACES remain inscrutable
THE DJINN utters a single word

THE DJINN
Hello

HOLD CLEM and FANNY Time is suspended
Until finally they say

CLEMENTINE and FANNY
Hello

THE DJINN is real to others

CUT TO BLACK

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
My Djinn told me when they come together

in the Realm of Djinn - they tell each other stories
Stories are like breath to them

TI hey make meaning

Out of the black we see
DRONE IMAGES OF SPRAWLING TECHNOLOGY

RADIO TV and CELL PHONE TOWERS - TRANSMITTERS pointing in all directions
Buildings covered with white SATELLITE DISHES like rampant mushrooms

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
Yes’ 1 said ‘That’s ust how it is with us’
Fach story we tellis a fragment
in an endless shape-shi ing mosaic
And this small “pebble like all stories must end
of it’s about wishing -it’sa cautionary tale
So how will it g° wrong Perhaps it already has

AS ALITHEA ADDRESSES A CROWD
In an over-packed LECTURE THEATRE

THE DJINN stands at the back in his LONDON THREADS - the long coat the beanie
and leather gloves

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
In the days that followed

the Djinn would accompany the Narratologist to her work
And when he wasn’t with her

he would ge in eager exploration of the world
IN A NEUROSURGICAL SUITE

Unseen in the shadows THE DJINN observes a TEAM of MEDICOS perform
advanced Cerebral Angiography They are lit only by the glow of multiple screens
as they guide their catheters

THE DJINN (VO)
Today had such a marvellous day
saw many things

watched a human look into the living brain of another
and arrest a fatal bleeding
THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER - GENEVA
THE DJINN is in awe of this prodigious technological apparatus

THE DJINN (VO)
visited the ‘collider’ - a vast gizmo -
which probed the essence of matter

A GIANT RADIO TELESCOPE - JODRELL BANK
THE DJINN (VO)
And then saw a dish A great dish
that listens to the whispers of stars long dead

IN ALITHEA’S LIVING ROOM
They lounge by the fireplace

THE DJINN
Humankind is a wonder Alithea
ALITHEA
I’m happy you think so

THE DJINN
All this since was trapped in Zefir’s bottle
All these astonishments in less than 200 years

ALITHEA
Yes but that’s just engineering Technology
Despite all the whiz-bang we remain bewildered

THE DJINN
Oh

ALITHEA
When we can’t contain the chaos
we are filled with dread and panic
and we turn on each other

He sits up to look at her directly

THE DJINN
Well of course You’re human
That is your nature

ALITHEA
And so the story never changes
Hate prevails It metastasizes and outlives love
just want to talk about love

THE DJINN
Such a mess of contradictions
All of you

ALITHEA
Thank you very much

THE DJINN
Humankind What a conundrum
You fumble around in the dark and yet
you herd your intelligence to great effect
It is quite a story
can’t wait to see where it goes

ALITHEA regards him solemnly

ALITHEA
Or how it might end

THE DJINN
That tooA mortal will never know
But a Djinn might A Djinn has all the time in the world

ALITHEA
Arent you the lucky one

THE DJINN
Maybe But you creatures of dust
have managed to eclipse the power and purpose of Djinn and Angels
You have no use for us perhaps we will wither and

ALITHEA
And fade away

THE DJINN
Yes

ALITHEA
That used to be the subject

of all my lectures and papers

THE DJINN
know

ALITHEA
And yethere you are

(quietly)
My impossible

THE DJINN
Yes

Their smiles are faint The mood is pensive

THE TOWNHOUSE - PRIMROSE HILL LONDON

We follow ALITHEA as she HURRIES to her front door

SHE ENTERS

ALITHEA
Hello I’m home

CAMERA stays in the LIVING ROOM - and waits - as she checks out the garden and

upstairs

She comes downstairs
And standsin the silence
At that moment

She notices a few FINE FLECKS of ASH drifting around her

ALITHEA
Djinn

They are coming from a door - slightly ajar

She goes to investigate and we follow her into

THE CELLAR

And there in the dark and the rising damp she finds

THE DJINN

He is propped up - back to us - against the stone wall Hunched over Foetal-like

ALITHEA
My love

He doesn’t move

She reaches out As she strokes his coat he begins to CRUMBLE under her touch
ALITHEA GASPS

She turns on the light and moves to see his face

The sheen of his dark satin skin is DULL and GREY

He is frosted in a FINE ASH

His EYES are open - OPAQUE - lifeless

ALITHEA
DjinnWhat’s this

The faint breeze from upstairs is eroding his features - FLECKS of him FLOAT up into
the shafts of light

ALITHEA doesn’t dare touch him again
She incants his name in a hoarse frantic whisper

ALITHEA
Can you hear me

Panicked Desperate

ALITHEA
Djinn Speak to me
Nothing
ALITHEA
Try to speak to me
Then

ALITHEA
wish you to speak to me

And it works Because it is a SECOND WISH
But as he opens his mouth to speak part of HIS FACE threatens to fall away
ALITHEA reaches out to stop it And ON HER TOUCH

His powdery skin QUIVERS and healthy vibrant COLOURS RADIATE from under her
fingers

The ash becomes vapour

And he is STARTLED back into the world
(He tries to articulate the word ‘Alithea’ but it’s lost in Djinnbish)

THE DJINN
wasss-sssleeping

ALITHEA
Djinn don’t sleep

His eyes regain focus
He lumbers to his feet and pulls his coat back over his shoulders
He clambers UP THE STAIRS and out of the cellar Gathering himself
THE DJINN
Let’s go for a walk
A long bracing walk
have prepared something for us

She notices the HEM of his FULL-LENGTH CASHMERE COAT DRAGGING on the
floor And the SLEEVES are TOO LONG for his arms

He tries to shake it off Djinn-glitching again

He manages to shape-shift ENLARGING back to his USUAL SIZE

THE DJINN
(manic)
have it all planned
A most wonderful night for us
It will be amazing
The best time of your life

He puts on his beanie and is about to open THE FRONT DOOR

ALITHEA
No No Stop

This stops him He turns to look at her
THE DJINN
These electromagnetic fields

can push them from my head
Push them away

Avoiding her he slips back into the LIVING ROOM

He picks up a tray of food a tennis racquet and a ukulele
THE DJINN
(floundering)

Well go for a picnic
Well play the ukulele

She stops him And calmly begins to take the objects from him

THE DJINN
Alitheathere is a place for me here

ALITHEA
These forces they will never go away
Not from this world

THE DJINN
will overcome them can do that for you
You are My Alithea And love you

ALITHEA
Thank you Thank you for trying

THE DJINN
You don’t think that love you

ALITHEA
Love is a gift
A gift of oneselfgiven freely
It’s not something one can ever ask for

As he grasps the idea

ALITHEA
tricked us both
The moment spoke that wish
took away your power to grant it

She lets this sink in

ALITHEA
I more than anybody should have known that
I’m not going to screw this up again

A deep breath

ALITHEA
My Djinn if this world is not for you

He is utterly still His breath suspended
ALITHEA
wish that you return to where you belong

(whispers)
Wherever that may be

CRAACKKK
They turn to see

The BOTTLE DISINTEGRATE and LIQUIFY into tiny marbles of glass As they
cascade onto the floor they fragment and trickle away tonothing

She smiles eyes moist in celebration of his release

He is OVERCOME with gratitude

There is something he wants her to know
He tries to speakBut he can’t

FADE TO BLACK

IN THE QUIETUS OF NIGHT

Like a drowsy infant ALITHEA lifts her heavy eyelids to check if he’s still there
He is

Looking at her tenderly

She smiles and drifts back into sleep
FADE TO BLACK

WE MAY REMEMBER

The image of ALITHEA packing the photo album of her marriage into a box marked
STORAGENow she does the same with the Djinn’s clothes - neatly folded

She stores the BOX in THE BASEMENT
FADE TO BLACK
A CAPTION
THREE YEARS LATER
ALITHEA SITS ON A BENCH IN A BUSY PARK
She has a fountain pen and - in sepia ink - is sketching in a leather-bound journal
She puts the finishing touches to a DIAGRAM explaining the stages of the DJINN’S
EMERGENCE from the BOTTLE - invisible gaseous vaporous particulate organic

(We may remember seeing the animated version of this drawing during the Zefir
sequence)

She is interrupted by LAUGHTER

Beyond her OUT OF FOCUS a COUPLE of YOUNG LOVERS are trying out roller-
blades for the first time They flop down on a park bench and canoodle

ALITHEA goes back to her journal riffling to the last pages - where we see that she
has written the narration we heard earlier

in the Realm of Djinn - they tell each other stories
Stories are like breath to them

TI hey make meaning

Now also OUT OF FOCUS someone APPROACHES her from BEHIND

It is a SMALL CHILD - perhaps two years old

THE CHILD
(softly)
MummyMummy
As ALITHEA turns to look

We see the BLURRED IMAGE of a FATHER pick up the child and move out of frame

FATHER
Mummy’s not here Sweet

Now ALITHEA flicks to the opening page of her journal where we see the title
THREE THOUSAND YEARS OF LONGING and the narration that began this story

My name is Alithea My story ts true
Yow’re more likely to believe me however

if tell it as a fairy tale

As she did years before with Enzo the imaginary school boy and later her ex-
husband she has made a JOURNAL of The Djinn

She snaps it shut sheathes the fountain pen and sets off walking through the park
NOWCAMERA CONVERGES ON HER FROM SEVERAL DISRUPTIVE ANGLES
From ABOVE From the LEFT From the RIGHT

And from BEHIND

She stops

Sensing a presence

She turns and there approaching from across the park is

THE DJINN (He is wearing a long coat and hoodie)

SHE GAZES at him - her face betraying no emotion

She CLOSES HER EYES and begins a count to ‘three’

Before she finishes his SHADOW falls on her

When she opens her eyes

He is there Right in front of her

They embrace

We watch as they walk off - arm in arm

A young man kicks a SOCCER BALL Hard

It bounces off a lamp post and hits THE DJINN on the shoulder

He recovers the ball and skillfully kicks it back
It ricochets off the post and bounces straight into the arms of the Soccer Player

who acknowledges him with an apologetic wave and a laugh
ALITHEA and THE DJINN continue on their way

To the casual observer they are just another couple in love

THE NARRATOR ALITHEA
He would visit from time to time

and they would grasp each vivid moment
Despite the ‘pain of the raucous skies
he always stayed longer than he should
long after she begged him to leave
He promised to return in her lifetime
And “for her that was more than enough

FADE TO BLACK
