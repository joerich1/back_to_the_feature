EXT HYDRA FORTRESS - FAKE EUROPE

We open on an UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENE as CHRIS HEMSWORTH ROBERT DOWNEY
JR CHRIS EVANS GREEN MARK RUFFALO SCARLETT JOHANSSON and JEREMY
RENNER storm a HYDRA base and straight up MURDER tons of regular non-superpowered
people in the worlds LEAST-FAIR FIGHT

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Oh look Im back with my catalogue of specialized suits This completely invalidates everything
that happened in Iron Man 3 so I guess everyone can just skip that one

CHRIS HEMSWORTH

Verily Thor 2 is similarly without merit or consequence

SCARLETT JOHANSSON

And Guardians took place in outer space so it doesnt affect whats going on either

CHRIS EVANS

Okay but Winter Soldier is totally important it established that HYDRA has been infiltrating
SHIELD for half a century Of course its been completely dismantled now and this is the very
last base that were about to destroy shit Is Phase 2 the Danny DeVito to Phase 1s
Schwarzenegger

GREEN MARK RUFFALO

ENTIRE PHASE 2 CAN BE IGNORED NEXT MOVIE ALL ABOUT SMALL BUG MAN
AND NOBODY CARE

JEREMY RENNER
Of course if you want to know why were even assaulting this fortress you should watch 41
hours of Agents of SHIELD to see the 65 seconds at the end of Season 2 Episode 19 where
Cobie Smulders holy shit this bubble is going to burst really soon isnt it

ROBERT shoots a MISSILE at the fortress that fails to penetrate its FORCEFIELD but then he
just SHOOTS THE FORCEFIELD because HYDRA never got around to watching RETURN
OF THE JEDI

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Alright guys Im inside the fortress Have we figured out a justification for the nearly invincible
Norse god not to be doing this instead of me

CHRIS EVANS
(over radio)

Yes hes carrying Jeremy Renner back to the ship because he got injured Damn Hawkeye still
sucks

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Perfect Ill just go ahead and find
(consults notes)

Lokis sceptre Geeze again

ROBERT finds LOKIS MIND-CONTROL SCEPTRE pulsating with MIND CONTROL
POWER that will surely be put to EXCELLENT DRAMATIC USE

Suddenly AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON and ELIZABETH OLSEN sneak up behind him and
ELIZABETH users her powers of MIND CONTROL HOLY FUCK WHEDON THINK OF
SOMETHING ELSE

AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON

You have used vague powers to make metal man die yes

ELIZABETH OLSEN

Nyet I see that allowing him to succeed vill ultimately cause destruction for moose and squirrel

so I leave alone Gave him nightmare for use in many trailer Has broken Captain America shield
and everythink fanboys will love
The TEAM returns to NEW YORK about 4000 MILES AWAY but thats at least a3 HOUR
FLIGHT so

IMMEDIATE SMASH CUT TO
INT AVENGERS TOWER - REAL NEW YORK CITY

ROBERT and MARK are doing SCIENCE with the MAGIC SCEPTRE while everyone else is
CONVENIENTLY IN ANOTHER ROOM

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Mark this sceptre has a neural computer in it or some shit I want to experiment with it just give
me three days

MARK RUFFALO

Why are you asking me Hemsworth already said okay though who the hell knows why
ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Look you know how weve been trying to create a super advanced robot AI to protect the world
from aliens Well this technology from those exact same aliens used by the leader of those
aliens to nearly destroy us all might be the key to stopping future aliens Im going to load the
computer stuff and see what happens

MARK RUFFALO

What Are you seriously the dipshit that finds a random USB key in your office parking lot and
immediately plugs it into your work computer

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Okay I ran notavirusexe Now lets go party AI Paul Bettany can finish this up

(leaves with Mark)

AI PAUL BETTANY aware of Marvels recent track record dutifully makes countless
attempts to create a memorable interesting new villain before finally deciding FUCK IT IM
JUST GONNA STUFF JAMES SPADERS AUDITION TAPE FOR THE BLACKLIST
INTO A MURDERBOT STILL BETTER THAN FUCKING MALLAKESH

INT PARTY ROOM

ROBERT and MARK rejoin the others and drink and do cool AVENGERS STUFF together like
BEST BUDS as if its NO BIG DEAL
DON CHEADLE

Oh hey Robert just wanted you to know that Anthony Mackie and I arent sore at all being left
out of the HYDRA fight after all he only took out a whole helicarrier by himself while Im a
militarily-trained fighter with THE EXACT SAME SUIT AS YOU DICK

DON promptly FUCKS OFF out of the movie Suddenly

ROBOT JAMES SPADER

Greetings Avengers I am an evil robot bent on the destruction of all humanity but dont worry
about me being menacing or machine-like I still do the whole sarcastic quip thing like the rest of
everyone Joss Whedon writes dialog for Also I killed JARVIS in a ridiculous scene where two
different colored sets of blocks glowed at each other Hollywoods grasp of technology is firmly
stuck in the 90s

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Oh no but JARVIS is how I interact with my suits hes how I process data he runs pretty much
all aspects of my superheroing without him I wont have an endless supply of lazy narrative
cheats just kidding Ive loaded up a replacement JARVIS and its a girl

Suddenly a bunch of BROKEN IRON MAN ROBOTS now controlled by JAMES SPADER
attack They are dispatched effortlessly since their primary function was WALKING
VOICEMAIL MESSAGE

ROBOT JAMES SPADER

Mwahaha behold the Age of Ultron has begun It will last five days Work Week of Ultron
didnt test well

(flies away)
COBIE SMULDERS

Right My job now is to hand people folders while walking so heres a folder with a picture of
Andy Serkis in it Go find him

SCARLETT JOHANSSON
Serkis He smuggles vibranium out of the fictional African nation of Wakanda He uses it to
create counterfeit Best Actor Oscars since he cant get a real one - BOOM you just got put on

blast Serkis motion capture isnt real acting you punk bitch

CHRIS EVANS
Then we have no choice but to abandon the America-centric locales of the first Avengers film
and travel to faraway exotic lands none of which actually exist To Wakanadia

INT VIBRANIUM SMUGGLING FACILITY - FAKE AFRICA

CHRIS OTHER CHRIS and ROBERT all go to WAKANDA which is the MOST
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COUNTRY in the ENTIRE MARVEL UNIVERSE but
since its in AFRICA it still has DIRT ROADS and tons of VIOLENT THUGS with MACHINE
GUNS They confront ROBOT JAMES SPADER who has already dismissed the ANDY
SERKIS CAMEO and enlisted the help of AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON and ELIZABETH
OLSEN

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Alright Spader were taking you down As an engineer your weirdly flexible chrome skin mouth
offends me Fucking Transformers did robot mouths better why do your lips even move

AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON

Not so vast I am Qvicksilver and have power of super-speed As Days of Vuture Past show I
am ludicrously owerpowered and can easily--

(knocks himself out)
ELIZABETH OLSEN

Behold I am the Scarlet Witch with the power to make Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen regret
every career decision theyve ever made Also brain stuff and red things

ELIZABETH gives everyone NIGHTMARES or VISIONS or PROBABILITIES or
WHATEVER NEEDS TO HAPPEN Suddenly MARK RUFFALO turns into GREEN MARK
RUFFALO because M-M-M-M-M-MIND CONTROL

HULK RUFFALO

RAARRRGH HULK SEE FUTURE WHERE UNIVERSAL STILL OWN RIGHTS TO HULK
SOLO FILM PLANET HULK OFF TABLE HULK SMASH ENTIRE CITY

ROBERT DOWNEY JR
Time to bring down my larger Iron Man suit that wraps around my normal Iron Man suit like a
hilarious Russian doll but nobody is going to laugh because all the sweaty neckbeards in the

audience are squealing HULKBUSTERRRRR right now

ROBERT and MARK proceed to MAN OF STEEL their way through DOWNTOWN
WAKANDA
CHADWICK BOSEMAN

(not present)

Eventually ROBERT throws an ENTIRE BUILDING at MARK so he takes a NAP

INT QUINJET

COBIE SMULDERS

So yeah everyones pretty upset how you annihilated that city But just give it a few days until
that fuckawful Supergirl TV trailer comes out and HOO BOY this little mess will be forgotten
faster than Terrence Howard

JEREMY RENNER

We can all hide out at my private farm Ive kept it totally under the radar by making Hawkeye
so boring and useless people would forget all about me And hey worst case my whole family
dies

CHRIS HEMSWORTH

I wouldst love to but I wilt find Stellan Skarsgard so he may help me find a pool that gives
uh visions Apologies the whole of this subplot clearly wound up on the cutting room floor and

everyone just gaveth up is there a Razzie for Worst Editing

The team dick around on the FARM for a while Upstairs MARK has just finished scrubbing the
green paint from behind his ears when SCARLETT walks in

SCARLETT JOHANSSON

I need to tell you something Mark As a child I was brainwashed and psychologically tortured to
become an unfeeling killing machine My humanity was stripped away and as a final insult they
performed invasive surgery against my will So what Im saying is that I have terrible deep-
seated scars that like many victims lead me to feel bad about myself

MARK RUFFALO

Wow thats some deep shit to be dropping into a popcorn escapist blockbuster Wed better be
real careful how we --

SCARLETT JOHANSSON
I HAVE NO WOMB WHOS THE MONSTER NOW

MARK RUFFALO
Aww fuck lets abruptly change the subject - hey I bet Spader is going to Korea to have Claudia
Kim build him a vibranium-skinned body

CHRIS EVANS
What the fudge
SCARLETT JOHANSSON

Just go with it Joss Whedon was told to cut four hours out of this movie youre lucky we still
say complete sentences

INT MEDICAL RESEARCH FACILITY - EAST KOREA

ROBOT JAMES SPADER has convinced CLAUDIA KIM to join his ranks through convincing
argument or perhaps hes got her family held hostage and is demanding she comply or NAH
FUCK IT MMMMMMMMMIND CONTROL AGAIN

CLAUDIA KIM

Your new robot body is being synthesized Its purple for some reason and it looks like Paul
Bettany who was announced as Vision and has been providing the voice of JARVIS for five
movies gosh I wonder what will happen

JAMES SPADER

Perfect soon I will be able to use this body to finish my master plan to destroy the planet using a
device that doesnt depend on my having this body in any way

ELIZABETH OLSEN

Did you say destroy planet I am part of planet so 1 am Avenger now

AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON

Da I am also Avenger now who could guess red-eyed robot voiced by creepy actor is bad guy
Suddenly SPADERS UPLOAD of his brain into PURPLE PAUL BETTANY is CANCELLED
as HALF OF THE AVENGERS show up Theres an extended MATRIX RELOADED CAR
CHASE that ends with SPADER getting away with SCARLETT and THE AVENGERS getting
PURPLE PAUL BETTANY

CHRIS EVANS

Well we prevented Krang here from getting a new body and we lost the only female member
but weve added three new Avengers to the roster so Id say this was a net win for Hasbro
JEREMY RENNER

Oh good just what this franchise needed more superheroes Lets turn that mailbox into a
superhero too Maybe this hubcap

The TEAM returns to NEW YORK about 6800 MILES AWAY but thats at least a 45 HOUR
FLIGHT so

IMMEDIATE SMASH CUT TO
INT AVENGERS TOWER - NEW YORK CITY

ROBERT and MARK are doing SCIENCE with the MAGIC ROBOT while everyone else is
CONVENIENTLY IN ANOTHER ROOM

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Mark this robot has an infinity stone in it or some shit I want to experiment with it just give me
three hours

MARK RUFFALO

Wait whats happening right now

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Look you know how weve been trying to create a super advanced team to protect the world
from murderous robots Well this technology from those exact same robots used by the leader
of those robots to nearly destroy us all might be the key to stopping future robots Im going to
turn it on and see what happens

MARK RUFFALO

This feels really familiar

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Okay Im running notamurderbotexe Now lets go party--

CHRIS EVANS

Not so fast Just what do you think youre doing Robert What on Earth makes this different
than the last time you did this No seriously can you explain it I feel like something got cut out

again and Im lost

MARK RUFFALO
Its different because the gem is yellow instead of blue Chris Holy shit Im defending this This
is so contrived

AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON
I vill use super-speed to stop from happening
JEREMY RENNER

Not if I have anything to say about it Wait Im in favor of this too And did I just use a bullet
instead of an arrow What the hell is going on here

CHRIS HEMSWORTH
(flying in)

VERILY IKNOW NOT WHAT THE FUCK STAGE YOUR EXPERIMENT HAS REACHED
BUT IM GONNA JUST ELECTROCUTE SHIT AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS

(zaps every fucking thing)

PURPLE PAUL BETTANY pops out

PURPLE PAUL BETTANY

Have no fear Avengers I only got the good parts of Spader and the good parts of the mind gem
And maybe JARVIS Also I can fly because robot stuff And hell I can just make a cape appear
on me why the fuck not

CHRIS EVANS

So are you a good robot Your eyes arent red so my guess is that you are

PURPLE PAUL BETTANY

I dont think its that simple but yes its that simple Im totally good Lets kill Ultron With
kindness And head lasers

JEREMY RENNER
Excuse me Scarlett just tapped two wires together half a world away it seems Ultron has
returned to the only other location weve been to in this movie Wow how did we not think to

look there Anyway he has an army of robots and we have to stop him

ROBERT DOWNEY JR
So just like last time we have to fight a huge army of weak henchmen in the middle of a big
city Is it time to admit that the MCU has matured past the capabilities of Joss Whedon now

CHRIS EVANS

This is different Last time it was an army of actual living breathing aliens which somehow all
died when we blew up the central ship This time its actual machines which youd expect to
shut down if we killed Spader but in fact have to be dealt with individually

AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON

Before we go can I change out of gym clothes No I wear track suit for rest of movie because I
am Russian

EXT DOWNTOWN FAKE EUROPE

JAMES SPADER has used the VIBRANIUM to build a giant JET PACK for the city of
SOKOSLOVAKIASTAN which is now floating in midair

CHRIS EVANS

Alright Avengers its time for the brain-numbing action climax that plays out almost identically
to every other Marvel movie Hemsworth I need you to go away for a while so that nobody
remembers how you could effortlessly just electrocute all of these robots and end this battle
CHRIS HEMSWORTH

The usual understood

(leaves)

CHRIS EVANS

Mark go find Scarlett Johansson James Spader left her alive for absolutely no reason its
ridiculous

MARK RUFFALO

On it And I promise I wont turn green Ill just grab Scarlett and well move away and live
together and not help stop the world from being destroyed Superheroes

(leaves)

CHRIS EVANS
Robert I need you to fly around pointlessly and explain over and over what Spaders plan is until
it stops sounding idiotic

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Yes sir Hes going to lift up this entire city and then drop it and kill the planet and Ive got my
work cut out for me huh You sure you wouldnt rather I just detonate an EMP and end all this
Whatever

(leaves)

CHRIS EVANS

The rest of you come with me Priority one is to get the civilians to safety You hear that Zack
Snyder This whole third act is a big fat middle finger to you

JAMES SPADERBOT

BWAH HA Tremble before my awesome new vibranium body which appears to be exactly as
strong and resilient as my previous body

AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON

Is just me or is crazy that darker more mature Avengers movie still has no stakes because
nobody die

Suddenly CHRIS EVANS ROBERT DOWNEY JR SCARLETT JOHANSSON JEREMY
RENNER DON CHEADLE ANTHONY MACKIE PAUL BETTANY and ELIZABETH
OLSEN are confirmed for CAPTAIN AMERICA CIVIL WAR MARK RUFFALO rumored
AARON TAYLOR-JOHNSON

Oh

(dies)

You did not see this coming Crap I have 5 lines in movie and two are same Ive been
Hawkeyed

ELIZABETH OLSEN
Noooooooo my brother is dead

JEREMY RENNER
Oh like Sebastian Stan from Captain America Or Clark Gregg from Avengers Or Gwyneth
Paltrow from Iron Man 3 Or Tom Hiddleston from Thor 2 Or Sam Jackson from Captain
America 2 Or Vin Diesel from Guardians of the Galaxy

ELIZABETH OLSEN

Nyet actually dead Like we cant top X-Mens Quicksilver so fuck it dead

CHRIS EVANS

Okay but we can obviously revive him with Project TAHITI which was specifically developed to
revive fallen Avengers Or we could use Thanoss time gem and undo it Or we could upload
his consciousness into a computer a robot or a life model decoy These are all actually things

SCARLETT JOHANSSON

Holy hell comic books are asinine why are people acting like were not watching the death
throes of filmmaking

Everyone gathers in the middle of the city to play TOWER DEFENSE with an onslaught of
robots that ELIZABETH OLSEN could instantly vaporize with her mind Eventually all of the
robots are dead except JAMES SPADER Then JAMES SPADER is too Maybe

CHRIS HEMSWORTH

The day is won Now I must away to collect my deleted scenes and rework them into Thor 3

GREEN MARK RUFFALO

HULK FLY JET AWAY BUT NOT INTO STARS PLANET HULK NOT HAPPENING
STOP TWEETING PUNY MARK RUFFALO

ROBERT DOWNEY JR

Ive decided to retire as Iron Man once again Perhaps Ill go into politics wink wink franchise
building

CHRIS EVANS assembles a team of NEW AVENGERS consisting of ANTHONY MACKIE
DON CHEADLE SCARLETT JOHANSSON ELIZABETH OLSEN and PURPLE PAUL
BETTANY

CHRIS EVANS

Okay I got two black guys two women and a robot That should keep the bleeding-heart pinko
Commies satisfied until this team horribly fucks up and starts the Civil War of course
(deep breath)

Avengers assem--

END

JOSS WHEDON winks so hard that his eyeball breaks After some credits

JOSH BROLIN

payoff to all of these stupid teases or will superhero fatigue set in after the releases of Ant-Man

Doctor Strange starring Khan Wolverine 3 Guardians of the Galaxy 2 Wonder Woman maybe
