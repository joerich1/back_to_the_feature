ON THE WATERFRONT
by

Budd Schulberg

Shooting Script 1954
FADE IN
EXT—ESTABLISHING SHOT—WATERFRONT—NIGHT

Shooting toward a small building (Hoboken Yacht Club) set
upon a wharf floating about twenty-five yards off shore A
long narrow gangplank leads from the wharf to the shore
and on either side of the wharf are large ocean liners which
are being unloaded by arc light In the BG is the
glittering New York skyline A great liner blazing with
light is headed down river A ferry chugs across to
Manhattan There is a counterpoint of ships whistles some
shrill others hauntingly muted

CLOSER SHOT—SMALL BUILDING—ON WHARF—NIGHT

It is the office of the longshoremens local for this section
of waterfront Coming along the gangplank toward the shore

is an isolated figure He is TERRY MALLOY a wiry jaunty
waterfront hanger-on in his late twenties He wears a
turtleneck sweater a windbreaker and a cap

He whistles a familiar Irish song
SERIES OF WALKING SHOTS—TERRY MALLOY—WATERFRONT—NIGHT

Reaching the shore and turning away from the union office
Passing the burned-out piers

Turning up a waterfront tenement street lit by a dim street
lamp that throws an eerie beam He is holding something inside
his jacket but we cannot see what it is

NOTE MAIN TITLES TO BE SUPERIMPOSED OVER THIS SERIES OF
SHOTS

EXT—WATERFRONT STREET—NIGHT

Terry walks along until he reaches an ancient tenement where
he stops hesitates looks up toward the top of the building
and putting his fingers to his mouth lets out a shrill
effective whistle that echoes up the quiet street Then he
cups his hands to his mouth and shouts

TERRY
Hey Joey Joey Doyle
MEDIUM SHOT—TENEMENT WINDOW—NIGHT

THE WINDOW OF A THIRD-STORY ROOM FROM TERRYS POV JOEY
DOYLE A

youthful rather sensitive and clean-cut Irish boy pokes
his head out the window

JOEY
Terry
(then a little
suspiciously)
What do you want

REVERSE ANGLE—WATERFRONT STREET—NIGHT

TERRY
Hey look-

He reaches into his windbreaker in a gesture associated with
drawing a gun from a shoulder holster But instead he draws
out a live racing pigeon As he does so the bird makes an
effort to escape and flaps its wings but Terry subdues it
expertly and holds it up for Joey to see

TERRY
(somewhat uneasily)
-—one of yours I recognized the band

CLOSE—ON JOEY AT WINDOW—NIGHT
There is a fire escape in front of it

JOEY
Yeah Must be Danny-boy I lost him
in the last race

TERRY
He followed my birds into their coop
Here you want him

JOEY
(cautiously)
Well I got to watch myself these
days Know what I mean

TERRY
Ill bring him up to your loft

JOEY

(some what reassured)
Ill see you on the roof

( )

Joey closes the window and turns away
EXT—MEDIUM CLOSE—TENEMENT—ON TERRY —NIGHT

Tensely as if going through something he wishes he could
avoid Terry looks in the direction of the tenement stoop
and nods Now for the first time we see two men standing
there under the doorway so that Joey was unable to see them
from his window When Terry nods they enter the tenement
hallway he takes a few steps forward so as to be out of
sight from Joeys widow Then Terry raises the pigeon into
the air and inexplicably releases it As it wings out of
sight he turns and starts up the street in the direction
from which he came walking crabwise as if trying to see the
effect of what he has just done A soddenly drunk one-armed
longshoreman MUTT MURPHY staggers toward him singing ina
hoarse voice

MUTT
(as if it were a dirge)
Tippi-tippi-tim tippi-tim Tippi-
tippi-tan tippi-tan
(He stumbles into
Terry)
Gotta dime for a crippled-up docker

TERRY
Go on beat it

MUTT
A dime Terry a dime for a cup of
coffee

TERRY
Dont give me that coffee you rummy
Now blow

MUTT

Thanks for nothing you bum

With a certain battered dignity Mutt moves off picking up

his song Tippi-tippi-tan tippi-tan Terry takes an
anxious glance back toward the tenement

EXT—TENEMENT ROOFTOP—NIGHT

In the BG on the far shore is the New York skyline In the
MG a ship is being unloaded on this side of the river In
the FG is a coop of racing pigeons Joey comes out on the
roof and looks around The door f rom the tenement stairway
creaks open and Joey turns

( )

JOEY
Terry

There is no answer Joey is surprised

JOEY
That you Terry

Two men step out upon the roof their faces hidden in shadows

Joey looks startled and retreats a few steps

JOEY
Wheres Terry

The two men (BARNEY and SPECS) advance silently

JOEY
He said hed meet me up here

CLOSE SHOT—JOEY—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

Now he realizes the intentions of the two men He looks around

for some means of escape

MEDIUM CLOSE—BARNEY AND SPECS—ROOFTOP—NIGHT
From Joeys angle Moving in

MEDIUM CLOSE—JOEY—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

He makes a wild dash for the fire escape which leads him to
the roof

But when he reaches it another goon SLIM appears cutting
off this escape

LONG SHOT—ROOFTOP—NIGHT

Joey turns and runs along the edge of the roof the
illuminated skyline in the BG He disappears from view as
if he has jumped o ff the roof

MEDIUM SHOT—LOWER ROOFTOP LEVEL—NIGHT

This rooftop is one floor lower than the rooftops on either
side of it forming a trough between the two and providing
no further avenue of escape for Joey As Joey looks around
desperately Barney appears on upper level and another goon
SONNY appears on the other Now Joey is trapped between
them As they move forward he retreats backward toward the
edge of the roof

JOEY
(defiantly)
You want me to jump so it looks like
an accident

The assailants close in silently Joey gestures them on

JOEY
Come on Ill take one of you with
me

The goons edge in still closer poker-faced knowing they
have him

EXT—FRIENDLY BAR—NIGHT 15

An old-fashioned corner saloon with swinging doors Standing
on the corner fl anked by a goon aptly named the TRUCK is
CHARLEY THE GENT Terrys older brother rather handsome if
a little too smooth in his late thirties a snappy dresser
in his camel hair coat and snap brim hat He is quick-witted
and affable more politician than mobster

Terry enters to him

CHARLEY
(gently)
How goes
TERRY
(tightly)
Hes on the roof
CHARLEY
The pigeon
TERRY
(resentfully)

Like you said It worked

TRUCK
(to Terry tapping
his own temple)
That brother of yours is thinkin’
alla time

TERRY
(tense)
All the time

There is a short shrill almost human cry of a boat whistle
It changes slightly in pitch and we are hearing an actual
cry

CLOSE SHOT—BODY OF JOEY 16
Hurtling off roof with a bloodcurdling shriek

INT—CLOSE SHOT—WOMAN AT WINDOW (MRS COLLINS) 17
She screams

EXT—FRIENDLY BAR—FAVORING TERRY—NIGHT 18
Worried as he begins to wonder what happened

TRUCK
Im afraid somebody fell off a roof

Terry stares at him Longshoremen come running out of the

bar toward the sound of the scream Terry has to struggle

not to be carried along with them He works his way toward
Charley standing on the curb with Truck calmly watching

the Friendly Bar customers excitedly running past him (Calls
and commotion in the distance 0OS)

TRUCK
He thought he was gonna sing for the
Crime Commission He wont

Truck winks at Charley significantly Terry catches the
meaning and is horrified

TERRY
(accusingly)
You said they was only going to talk
to him
CHARLEY

That was the idea

TERRY
I thought theyd talk to him Try to
get him to dummy up

CHARLEY
Maybe he gave them an argument

TERRY
I figured the worst theyd do is
work him over a little

CHARLEY
He probably gave ‘em an argument

( )

TRUCK
(almost primly)
Hes been giving our boss a lot of

trouble

TERRY
He wasnt a bad little fella that
Joey

CHARLEY
No he wasnt

TRUCK
Except for his mouth

CHARLEY
Talkative

TERRY

(muttering to himself)
Wasnt a bad little fella

TRUCK
(chuckling)
Maybe he could sing but he couldnt
fly

Terry looks at Truck stricken

CHARLEY
(sympathetically
nodding toward bar)
Come on kid Ill buy you a drink

TERRY
(bewildered)
In a minute

Charley looks at him slightly concerned and goes in with
Truck Terry watches the longshoremen hurrying past him in
the direction of—

DISSOLVE
INT—FRIENDLY BAR—NIGHT 25

The atmosphere is the sharpest possible contrast to the scene
above It is a rough waterfront bar full of half-gassed
longshoremen and pistol boys They are all watching a fight
on TV above the bar and there is much hoarse laughter and
ad lib jokes at the fight The only one not watching is Terry
who sits at a table by himself staring at a half-finished
glass of beer Mutt is wandering around in the BG

VOICE (0S)

Hey Terry Rileys makin a bum

INT—BACK ROOM OF BAR—NIGHT 27

A partition separates this room from the main bar anda
small corner of the bar extends through the partition On
the wall are old fight posters and some pictures of fighters
ball players and horses At a table flanked by Charley and
a tall muscular bodyguard SONNY is JOHNNY FRIENDLY He is
not tough in a conventional way but with a sinister intent
a humorless sense of domination that is really dangerous

The boxing match can be seen on a smaller TV set

JOHNNY FRIENDLY

Turn it off Them clowns cant fight
Theres nobody tough anymore

( )

JOCKO the bartender pokes his head through the archway

behind the bar

JOCKO
Hey boss Packy wants another one

JOHNNY
(with a generous wave
of his hand)
Give it to him

As Johnny finishes off a bottle of beer BIG MAC the

bullnecked hiring boss comes up to the table with
roll of bills

BIG MAC

Heres the cut from the shape-up

(puts on glasses

incongruous on his

beefy face)

casually MORGAN a big-eared large-nosed little weasel of
aman pokes his head in the door as if he were waiting just
outside

MORGAN

(mockingly — Morgan

voice)

tries to count)

TERRY
(hot-tempered starting
to attack Big Mac)

Now listen Mac—

ghs and pulls Terry back

JOHNNY
(amused)

JOHNNY

(taking the money

from Sonny Skins

and JP and dealing

out some bills to

each of them as if

while Charley goes

on counting)
Listen kid Im a soft tough too

But my old lady raised us ten kids
on a stinkin watchmans pension

(sorry to have aroused

frightening force
when stung)

tough fellas were in the way
They left me this—
(suddenly holds up
chin to show a long
ugly scar on neck)
—to remember them by

CHARLEY

When he got up and chased them they
thought it was a dead man coming
after them

JOHNNY
(to Terry)

We may be seeing you again
TERRY

Chick laughs and punches Terrys arm with rough affection

TERRY
(responding to the
praise)
One more word n I wouldve belted

The beefy longshoreman actually makes a grab for one of the

and pushed The beefy longshoreman slightly behind Mac
suddenly knocks the box of tabs out of his hand

FREE-FOR-ALL FAVORING POP and TERRY 54
Pop is battling near the edge of the free-for- all in view

of Edie and Father Barry He sees a tab on the ground and is
about to pick it up when another man only slightly younger

( )

54

and bigger punches him in the nose He retaliates with a
looping punch that knocks his adversary back but he is unable
to scoop up the tab because meanwhile a crony of Terrys has
called over

JACKIE
Hey Terry Grab me on

Terry reaches for it with one hand while blocking Pop off
with his leg

He calls over to a crony

TERRY
Here you go Jackie boy

As he hands it over to his chum Pop comes charging in at
Terry

POP
Hey give me that

He swings wild punches at Terry Just then Luke the burly
Negro longshoreman sees a tab behind Pop hurls himself
toward it carrying Pop with him and back into the battle
royal

CLOSE SHOT—EDIE 55

She has seen the above action and makes a beeline for Terry
She is furious

EDIE
Give me that It belongs to Pop He
saw it first

Terry is enjoying himself Unconsciously Edie is pressing
herself against him to get the tab and her rage is a kind of
passion that pleases him

TERRY
Oh I thought you was gonna go to
work— with all them muscles
(winks at Jackie who
laughs )

EDIE
Give it to me— my Pops job—

TERRY
What makes him so special

him the tab)

him)

EDIE

He runs his hand over his face and then with a sudden
impulse

TERRY
You dont want to lug bananas in the
rain anyway do you Jackie

He reaches over and takes the tab back from Jackie

JACKIE

Aah give it to ‘im

Terry hands the slip to Edie and adds for the benefit of
his pals

TERRY
Here you go muscles Nice wrastlin
with you

He flexes his forearm and throws two quick jabs at an
imaginary opponent a characteristic gesture He sets his
cap at a jaunty angle and winks at his chums but we feel his
manner is forced barely hiding his guilt

Edie looks after him with smoldering anger

( ) 55

She turns as Father Barry comes into view leading Pop Pops
nose is bleeding and he is pretty thoroughly battered Nolan
joins him

FATHER BARRY
Pop you all right

POP
(brusquely)
Sure just the beak—

(taps his nose)
Its been busted before

Edie hands him the tab

EDIE
Here-I got it for you

Pop takes it but he is humiliated and bitter that she should
see him in this moment of weakness

POP

Okay I can use it—

(glares at her)
Now go back to the Sisters where you
belong

(His anger mounting

with his need to

regain his self-

respect he turns on

Father Barry)
Im surprised with you Father if
you dont mind my sayin so Lettin
her see things aint fit for the
eyes of a decent girl

Just then Big Mac shouts from the pier opening

BIG MAC

Pop jumps and hurries

MEDIUM CLOSE—EDIE AND FATHER BARRY 56

Watching him go Around them are at least one hundred rejected
men who linger in resentful silence Some of them are rubbing
hands bruised in the melee A truck hurrying into the pier
sounds its horn loudly The men barely avoid being run down

BIG MAC
(angrily to the
rejected group)

Outa the way Come back tomorra

Father Barry looks at all this in amazement

FATHER BARRY
(to one rejected man)
What do you do now

The man shrugs too beaten down to answer Father Barry asks
Luke

FATHER BARRY
What are you gonna do

LUKE
(bitterly)
Like he says Come back tomorra

Luke goes along with Father Barry who approaches Moose and
Tommy who have also been rejected

FATHER BARRY

This is an overflow chapel for the church above There are
stained-glass windows an altar pews and the figures of
saints but all is utter simplicity it has not lost its
basement feeling and the unadorned walls and low lighting
may suggest the catacombs

The above is seen from the POV of Terry as he approaches
Inside Father

Barry faces a small group of longshoremen still in their
work clothes

including Nolan Moose Tommy and Luke Edie sits behind
them A thin-faced rather ascetic-looking priest FATHER
VINCENT sits disapprovingly in the rear As Terry stands in
the rear not anxious to enter Father Barry is saying

FATHER BARRY

(rapidly with a

cigarette in his

mouth )
I thought thered be more of you
here but— the Romans found out what
a handful could do if its the right
handful And the same goes for you
and the mob thats got their foot on
your neck Im just a potato-eater
but isnt it simple as one - two
three One— The working conditions
are bad Two— Theyre bad because
the mob does the hiring Three— The
only way to break the mob is to stop
letting them get away with murder

them Everybody is

silent waiting)

question wed have a start

fist into the palm of his right hand Tommy runs his hand
over his face embarrassed Luke stares straight ahead of
him Terry sets his jaw stubbornly Edie looks at all of
them with a hopeful pleading intensity Father Barry waits
and then asks again—

FATHER BARRY
Not one of you has a line on—
who killed Joey Doyle

Silence
FATHER BARRY
Ive got a hunch every one of you
could tell us something about it
Silence

FATHER BARRY
Then answer this one— How can we
call ourselves Christians and protect
these murderers with our silence

Silence The Father looks from one to the other hoping for
some break in the ranks Terry starts down the aisle just
as Edie turns on Tommy

EDIE
Tommy Collins you were Joeys best
friend How can you just sit there
and not be saying anything

TOMMY
(miserably)
Ill always think of him as my best
friend but—

He falls silent and shakes his head Next to him Nolan
notices Terry

NOLAN

(mimics )
Who is he Edie youre so softhearted
and soft-headed you wouldnt recognize
the devil if he had you by the throat
You know who this Terry Malloy is
The kid brother of Charlie the Gent
Johnny Friendlys right hand a
butcher in a camel hair coat

EDIE
Are you trying to tell me Terry is
too
POP
(shouting)

Im not trying to tell you hes Little
Lord Fauntleroy

EDIE
He tries to act tough but theres a
look in his eyes that

POP
A look in his eyes Hold your hats
brother here we go again You think
hes one of those cases youre always
draggin in and feelin sorry for
Like the litter of kittens you had—the
only one she wants to keep has six
toes and its cockeyed to boot Look
at him The bum And the crush you
had on that little Abyssinian

EDIE
He wasnt Abyssinian Pop Assyrian

POP
Six-toed cats Assyrians Abyssinians
Its the same difference Well dont
think this Terry Malloy is any six-
toed cockeyed Assyrian Hes a bum
Charley and Johnny Friendly owned
him when he was a fighter and when
they ring the bell he still goes
into action

EDIE

(musing)
He wanted to see me again

( )

78 POP
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown
just to have you go walkin with a
corner saloon hoodlum like Terry
Malloy Now get back to Tarrytown
before I put a strap to you

EDIE
(flaring)
And learn about charity and justice
and all the other things people would
rather talk about than practice

Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms his right one
closer to Edie he trembles with emotion

POP

See this arm Its two inches longer
n the other one Thats years of
workin and sweatin liftin and
swingin a hook And every time I
heisted a box or a coffee bag I says
to myself—this is for Edie so she
can be a teacher or somethin decent
I promised your mother You better
not let her down

Suddenly touched Edie goes up to Pop and kisses him

EDIE

Pop dont think Im not feeling
grateful for all youve done to get
me an education and shelter me from
this

(becoming aroused)
But now my eyes are open I see things
I know are so wrong how can I go
back and keep my mind on things that
are only in books and that people
arent living Im staying Pop
And Im going to keep on trying to
find out whos guilty for Joey Id
walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys
if I thought they could help me I
tell you Im staying Pop

Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers

POP
You are like—

EDIE
(with regret and
affection)
Pop

She turns and runs out Pop with his belt in one hand takes
a few steps after her and then stops and stares at the unused
bus ticket

POP
(shaking his head as
he mutters)
Jesus Mary and Joseph keep an eye
on her

EXT—TENEMENT ROOFTOP—EVENING 719

Autumn on the roof It is not particularly romantic—there
are clotheslines wooden boxes etc But to the people of
this neighborhood it is a luxurious terrace Terrys birds
are aloft flying in a great circle nicely silhouetted
against the sun-drenched evening sky Jimmy Conners is with
him

Terry has a long pole with which he keeps the birds circling
Moose is leaning against the wall playing an Irish melody
on his harmonica His wife a heavyset woman sits beside
him

MOOSES WIFE
(Moving her feet)

My feet feels like dancin’ But the

rest of me just feels like settin

MEDIUM SHOT—TERRY 80
As he swings his pole he looks off and sees—
LONG SHOT—EDIE—ROOFTOP—EVENING 81
Hurrying toward him across the rooftops

MEDIUM CLOSE—TERRY—ROOFTOP—EVENING 82

Catching sight of her and stopping to admire her as she
comes toward him

TERRY
(to Jimmy )
Okay— I guess they got enough
exercise Let em come in

( )

He puts down the pole and the birds start flying down toward

the coop
He sees Edie approach

JIMMY
I wonder how long shes goin to
hang around huh Terry

TERRY
(indicating the pigeons)
Be sure they got enough water

And he turns to await Edie
SHOT—BRINGING EDIE TO TERRY
EDIE
I changed my mind I feel real mean
tonight
TERRY

(pleased)
Good So do I

As Jimmy goes off to fetch some water Edie reads the fancy

lettering on the back of his jacket

EDIE
The Golden Warriors

TERRY
I started them Golden Warriors I
was their first Supreme Commander

Now Jimmy starts back toward them

TERRY

My shadow He follows me around like
I was Mickey Mantle Thinks Ima
big man because I boxed pro for a
while

(throws a few quick

jabs)
Several pigeons swoop down and enter
the coop He nods towards her

TERRY

Here they come The champion flock
of the neighborhood

( )

EDIE
You dont mind yourself at all do
you
(turns to the birds)
Joey used to race pigeons

TERRY
(darkening)
He had a few birds
(pauses nods toward
Joeys coop across
the roof)
I got up and fed ‘em this morning

EDIE
That was nice of you

TERRY
(disconcerted needing
to talk)
I like pigeons You send a bird five
hundred miles away he wont stop for
food or water until hes back in his
own coop

EDIE
I wouldnt have thought youd be so
interested —in pigeons

TERRY
I go for this stuff You know this
citys full of hawks There must be
twenty thousand of ‘em

They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the
pigeons in the park

EDIE
(slightly horrified)
The things that go on

TERRY
(proudly indicating a
large pigeon in the
coop)
How do you like that one

EDIE
Oh shes a beauty

JIMMY

(critically)
Shes a he His name is Swifty

( )

They look 83
TERRY
My lead bird Hes always on that
top perch
EDIE

He looks awful proud of himself

JIMMY
Why shouldnt he Hes the boss

TERRY
If another fella tries to take that
perch away from him he lets him
have it

EDIE
Even pigeons arent peaceful

TERRY
One thing about them though theyre
faithful They get married just like
people

JIMMY
Better

TERRY
Yeah once theyre mated they stay
together all their lives until one

TERRY
(imploring)

special entrance for ladies
DISSOLVE
84 INT—SALOON—LADIES SIDE-—NIGHT 84
Perhaps a sign can emphasize Ladies Entrance As Terry leads

Edie in a tipsy Irish biddy is noisily protesting her
enforced departure

WOMAN
—Im only after havin one more wee
bit—

BARTENDER

You and your one-mores Now beat it

As Terry and Edie reach the bar the radio blares a baseball
game A roar goes up from the speaker Bartender nods to
Terry In the corner a small well-oiled longshoreman sings
Ill Take You Home Again Kathleen in a plaintive cracking
voice

BARTENDER
Well what do you know—Jackie just
stole home

TERRY
(glancing at Edie
with a mischievous
wink at the bartender)
I wouldnt mind doing that myself

The bartender grins Terry guides Edie to a small table
BARTENDER
(to Edie)

Whatre you drinking

Edie hesitates obviously not knowing what to ask for A
customer at the bar says loudly—

SINGER OF KATHLEEN

(BG)
Give me a Glockenheimer

84 84

EDIE
(it could be root
beer for all she
knows )
Ill try a— Glockenheimer

TERRY
(to bartender)
Likewise And draw two for chasers
(to Edie)
Now youre beginning to live

EDIE
(as the drinks are
poured)
I am

Edie picks up her glass sniffs the contents with some
distaste and then sips it tentatively Terry watches with
amusement

TERRY
(still swaggering)
Not that way— like this
(holds glass up)
Down the hatch
(gulps it down)
Wham

Edie takes her drink and does likewise She gasps and her
eyes pop

EDIE
(with soft amazement )
Wham

TERRY
(grinning at her)
How do you like it

EDIE
Its quite—
(gulps)
—nice

TERRY
How about another one

EDIE
(already feeling this
one )
No thanks

He stops
invisible 84

TERRY
(to bartender)
Hit me again Mac

BARTENDER
(as he pours drink)
See the fight last night That
Riley—both hands Little bit on

TERRY
Hope he has better luck

EDIE
Were you really a prize fighter

TERRY
(nods )
I went pretty good for a while didnt
I Al But— I didnt stay in shape—
and—
(a little ashamed)
—I had to take a few dives

EDIE
A dive You mean into the water

TERRY
(laughs harshly)
Naw in the ring a dive is-

shakes his head and with his finger draws an
square in the air

EDIE
(mystified)
Now what are you doing
TERRY
Describing you A square from out
there I mean youre nowhere

(draws it again)
Miss Four Corners

EDIE
(smiles but persistent)
What made you want to be a fighter

TERRY
I had to scrap all my life Figured
I might as well get paid for it

TERRY (CONTD)

When I was a kid my old man got
killed—never mind how Charley and I
was put in a place—they called it a
Childrens Home Some home I run
away and peddled papers fought in
club smokers and—

(catches himself)
But what am I runnin off at the
mouth for What do you care

EDIE
Shouldnt we care about everybody

TERRY
What a fruitcake you are

EDIE
Isnt everybody part of everybody
else
TERRY
Gee thoughts Alla time thoughts
(then )

You really believe that drool

EDIE
(deeply shocked)
Terry

TERRY
Want to hear my philosophy Do it to
him before he does it to you

EDIE
(aroused)
Our Lord said just the opposite

TERRY
Im not lookin to get crucified
Im lookin to stay in one piece

EDIE
(flaring up) I never met such a
person Not a spark of romance or
sentiment or— or human kindness in
your whole body

TERRY

What do they do for you except get
in your way

( ) 84

EDIE
And when things get in your way— or
people —you just knock them aside—
get rid of Them— is that your idea

TERRY
(defensive— stung)
Listen— get this straight— dont
look at me when you say them things
It wasnt my fault what happened to
your brother Fixing Joey wasnt my
idea

EDIE
(gently)
Why Terry who said it was

TERRY
(lamely)
Well nobody I guess But that Father
Barry I didnt like the way he kept
lookin at me

EDIE
He was looking at everybody the same
way Asking the same question

TERRY
(troubled not
convinced)
Yeah yeah
(suddenly)
This Father Barry whats his racket

EDIE
(shocked)
His— racket

TERRY
(trying to regain his
bravado)
Youve been off in daisyland honey
Everybodys got a racket

EDIE
But a priest

With his finger he again describes a square in the air and
then points through it to Edie This time it angers her

EDIE

You dont believe in anything do
you

( ) 84

TERRY
Edie down here its every man for
himself Its keepin alive Its
standin’ in with the right people so
you can keep a little loose change
jinglin in your pocket

EDIE
And if you dont

TERRY
If you dont
(points downward with
a descending whistle)
Keep your neck in and your nose clean
and Youll never have no trouble
down here

EDIE
But thats living like an animal—

Terry seems almost to illustrate this by the way he drains
off his beer and wipes his mouth with his sleeve

TERRY
Id rather live like an animal than
end up like—

He hesitates

EDIE
Like Joey Are you afraid to mention
his name

TERRY

(challenged—defensive)
Why keep harpin on it

(looks at her

unfinished beer)
Come on drink up You got to get a
little fun out of life Whats the
matter with you

(nods toward juke box)
Ill play you some music

He starts toward the juke box She turns with him Suddenly
something cries out in her almost as if she didnt know she
was going to say it—

EDIE
Help me if you can— for Gods sakes
help me

85 CLOSE—ON TERRY 85

For the first time the edge is knocked off his swagger He
feels the purity of her grief Hed like to help—thats his
immediate reaction

But theres his brother Charley and his steady work and his
loyalties to the mob and its code All this runs through his
mind confusing him tearing him

86 CLOSE—ON TERRY AND EDIE 86
Terry turns back to her with a helpless gesture

TERRY
I— Id like to Edie but—
(shakes his head)
—theres nothin I can do

Edie feels subdued ashamed at breaking down She rises and
in a low voice says—

EDIE
All right all right I shouldnt
‘ve asked you

TERRY
You havent finished your beer

EDIE
I dont want it But why dont you
stay and finish your drink

TERRY
(swinging off the
stool)
I got my whole life to drink
As if magnetized by her he follows her out
87 EXT—LADIES BAR—NIGHT 87

As Terry comes up alongside her

TERRY
Youre not sore at me

EDIE
(with complete
innocence)
What for

( )

87

TERRY
For— not being any help

She looks at him with disturbing simplicity

EDIE
Why no— I think you would if you
could
CLOSE UP—TERRY 88

Struck Her faith in him and in human nature becomes the
most painful kind of accusation

TWO-SHOT—EDIE AND TERRY—STREET—NIGHT 89
Softly silently she begins to cry

TERRY
(gently)
What are you crying for

EDIE
(shaking her head)
thought I felt mean tonight But Im
not— Im just— all mixed up

Ahead of them down the block is an outdoor neighborhood party
The rhythm of a small band reaches out to them Edie hangs
back and Terry takes her hand

TERRY
Come on Ill walk you through Its
the shortest way home

He takes her hand and she walks along with him passively
The street is illuminated with colored lights and bright
paper streamers There are several gaily decorated counters
serving drinks and sandwiches There are balloons and colored
paper hats Neighbors are dancing in the street Children
look on a few mimicking their elders f rom the sidelines
Above the street is a homemade banner inscribed JUST
MARRIED— JOHNNY AND MARY ODAY We catch a glimpse of the
happy young bridal couple as Terry and Edie reach the edge
of the celebrants Her eyes light up She has passed into a
dreamlike forgetfulness

TERRY
You like music

Edie nods dreamily

( )

89

TERRY
—and dancing

Edie nods again

TERRY
(pulling her to him
before she realizes
what has happened)
Were on

At first Edie dances somewhat clumsily and stiffly but
gradually begins to dance with zest and surprising skill as
if a whole suppressed side of her nature were suddenly being
released Terry is light on his feet and they do some
intricate steps together

TERRY
Hey were good
(grins at her)
The Sisters should see you now huh

She laughs out of her youth and embarrassment and unexpected
enjoyment of a stolen moment

Now Terry draws her to him and they dance a more conventional
half-time foxtrot to the music

TERRY
(awkwardly)
I— I never knew a girl like you
Edie I always knew the kind you
just grab em And— I never knew a
girl like you Edie

EDIE
Its fun dancing with your eyes
closed Im floating Im floating

They have danced off to a darker less populated section of
the street away from the bar and the bandstand Behind them
people are dancing and laughing Terrys lips brush her cheek
as they dance and move on to her mouth

TERRY
(breathlessly)
Edie

Carried away she allows him to kiss her and even responds
Then Terry feels someone tapping him on the shoulder He
wheels around to see—

CLOSE SHOT—BARNEY—STREET—NIGHT
Barney wears a colored paper hat
BARNEY

I been looking for you Terry
boss wants you

The

THREE-SHOT—TERRY EDIE AND BARNEY— STREET—NIGHT

While the music and dancing continue around them

TERRY
Right now

BARNEY

He just got a call from Mr

Upstairs Somethings gone wrong

TERRY
Im gonna take her home first

BARNEY

Id get over there Terry Ill take

the little lady home
TERRY
(for Edies benefit)
Ill come over when Im ready

BARNEY

You know Johnny when he gets mad

As suddenly as Barney arrived he ducks off

CLOSE—ON TERRY AND EDIE—STREET—NIGHT
Edie senses Terrys distraction
EDIE

(puzzled)
Who was that

She is about to move away Terry puts his hand on her arm

TERRY
(impulsively)

Edie listen stay out of this mess
Quit tryin to ask things about Joey

It aint safe for you

( )

92

EDIE
Why worry about me Youre the one
who says only look out for yourself

TERRY
(pent up with his
guilt and his
frustrated feeling
for her)
Okay get in hot water But dont
come hollerin to me when you get

burned
EDIE
Why should I come hollering to you
at all
TERRY
Because because

(apologetically as

if this were a sign

of weakness )
Listen Edie dont get sore now—
but I think were getting in love
with each other

EDIE
(really fighting
against it)
I cant let myself fall in love with
you

TERRY
(fervently)
That goes double for me

As they stare at each other in entangled hostility and love
a man turns from the food counter behind them just finishing
a hot dog and steps into Terrys path It is Mr Glover the
Commission investigator

In the BG is Gillette
GLOVER
Mr Malloy I was hoping I might

find you here

Terry turns as if to dart off Glover puts a restraining
hand on his arm

GLOVER

Youre being served with a subpoena
Mr Malloy

( ) 92

TERRY
What

GLOVER
(reaching quickly
into his briefcase)
Be at the State House Courtroom
Nine at ten oclock tomorrow

TERRY
I told you I dont know nothin and
I aint saying nothin’

GLOVER
You can bring a lawyer if you wish
And youre privileged under the
Constitution to protect yourself
against questions that might implicate
you in any crimes

TERRY
(more in pain than
anger now)
You know what youre askin Youre

askin—
GILLETTE
(stepping in from
BG) (sternly)

Mr Malloy all were asking you to
do is tell the truth

GLOVER
(more gently)
Goodnight kid

Terry looks at the subpoena in tortured confusion

EDIE
(softly)
What are you going to do
TERRY
(viciously reverting
to type)
I wont eat cheese for no cops thats
for sure
EDIE

(with sudden intuition)
It was Johnny Friendly who killed
Joey wasnt it

( )

Terry looks off and then looks down unable to speak

EDIE
He had him killed or had something
to do with it Didnt he He and
your brother Charley

Terry drops his eyes again he can say nothing

You cant tell me can you Because youre a part of it
Youre as bad as the worst of them arent you Terry Arent
you Tell me the truth

TERRY
Edie your old mans right go back
to that school out in daisyland
Youre driving yourself nuts— youre
driving me nuts— stop worrying about
the truth— worry about yourself

EDIE

Look out for number one Always number
one

(her voice rising in

anger )
I shouldve known you wouldnt tell
me Pop said Johnny Friendly used
to own you I think he still owns
you

(then gently and

hating to have to

say it)
No wonder everybody calls you a bum

TERRY
(as if struck)
Dont say that Edie dont

Edie is crying softly without sobs
EDIE
(with a half-sob)
Its true
TERRY
Im tryin to keep you from being

hurt— What more do you want

EDIE
Much more Terry Much much more

She runs off Terry looks after her pained the subpoena
weighs in his hand He stares at it in agony while the party

( ) 92

swirls around him Then the blare of an auto horn cuts through
the music

VOICE OF JOHNNY (0S)
Hey genius

Terry looks up
MEDIUM LONG SHOT 93

Johnny Friendlys black Cadillac parked across the street A
driver Sonny Truck Big Mac and Charley are in it Terry
hurries up to them

TERRY
(lamely)
I— I was just on my way up Johnny

JOHNNY
By way of Chicago

Sonny starts to laugh but Johnny cuts him short
How many times you been knocked out Terry

TERRY
(surprised)
Only two times why Johnny

Throughout the following tirade Charley would like to
intervene in Terrys behalf but Johnny roughly nudges him
into silence

JOHNNY
It must have been once too often I
think your brains come apart What
you got up there Chinese bells

TERRY
Aw Johnny

JOHNNY
I thought you were gonna keep an eye
on that church meeting

TERRY
Nothing happened Johnny

JOHNNY
Nothing happened he says Some
operator you got yourself there
Charley One more like him and well
all be wearing striped pajamas

( )

TERRY
(turning to Charley
for help)
It was a big nothing The Father did
all the talking

JOHNNY
Oh he did Half an hour later a
certain Timothy J Nolan went into
secret session with the Commission
and he did all the talking

TERRY
You mean Kayo Nolan the old timer
He doesnt know much

JOHNNY

He dont huh

(produces a bound

folder of testimony

from his pocket and

slams it on the fender)
Well he knows thirty-nine pages
worth of our operation

TERRY
Howd you get that

JOHNNY
(thumbing upstairs)
I got it Hot off the press

CHARLEY
The complete works of Timothy J
Nolan

TERRY

Nolan I knew he had guts but—

JOHNNY

Guts A crummy pigeon whos looking
to get his neck wrung

(to Charley)
You should have-

(to Charley)
You should have known better than to
trust this punched out brother of
yours He was all right hanging
around for laughs But this is
business I dont like goofoffs
messing in our business

( ) 93

TERRY
Now just a minute I-

CHARLEY

(suddenly)
What the hell are you doing with his
sister

(then turning to Johnny)
Its that girl Johnny the little
Doyle broad has him out on his feet
An unhealthy relationship

SONNY
Definitely

JOHNNY

Dont see her no more Unless youre
both tired of living Barney you
got her address

(then to others

businesslike)
Now listen if we dont muzzle Nolan
were into the biggest stink this
town ever seen We got the best
muscle on the waterfront The time
to use it is now— pronto— if not
sooner

(to Terry as he climbs

in the car)
And you know where youre going
Back in the hold— no more cushy job
in the loft Its down the hold with
the sweat gang till you learn your
lesson

Johnny twists Terrys cheek but not in fun this time as he
has often done before Now it is hard enough to draw blood
Then he turns to the driver

JOHNNY
Lets go

The car drives off fast almost running Terry down He stands
there looking after it alone in the street feeling his
wounded cheek and then scowling as he looks down at the
subpoena in his hand

DISSOLVE
EXT—FREIGHTER—DAY 94

The ship is being unloaded An empty pallet is swung from
the pier and lowered into the open hatch by the up-and-down-

( )

fall tackle Our CAMERA rides the pallet down into the hatch
to the second level where Terry is working A little removed
from him are Pop Moose and Nolan They are unloading Irish
whiskey

NOLAN
(lifting a case onto
the pallet joyously)
An Ir-rish ship loaded to the gunnels
with foine Ir-rish whiskey

He does a little jig and kisses the case as he sets it on
the pallet

Pop and Moose laugh But Terry looks over at Nolan tensely
Then he looks up out of the hatch

EXT—DOCK—DAY 95

Johnny Friendly comes up to the edge of the dock with Sonny
and Truck

Johnny mumbles something under his hand to Sonny and Sonny
nods and jumps down onto the deck of the ship

MEDIUM CLOSE—ON DECK—NEAR HATCH—DAY 96

Sonny motions to Specs Donahue glimpsed as Joeys killer at
the opening Specs nods and goes over to the winchman guiding
the tackle over the hatch He nods to him and takes his
place Then he catches the eye of—

MEDIUM CLOSE—BIG MAC 97

Standing on the deck just above the open hatch A wordless
message passes between him and Specs Then he looks down
into the hatch

INT—HATCH—DAY 98

Terry works grimly glancing up anxiously at Nolan Pop and
Moose whose mood in contrast is a whiskey-inspired euphoria

POP
You see Kayo the good Lord watches
over us after all

NOLAN
(in an undertone
gaily)
When we knock off lets have a bit
of a party
(MORE )

( )

NOLAN (CONTD)
Well drink to God and Ireland its
whiskey and its women to Joey and
Edie— and death to tyrants
everywhere

As he finishes this he reveals surreptitiously the neck of a
whiskey bottle concealed in his deep-pocketed jacket

POP
(with mock concern)
You think one bottles enough for
all them toasts

NOLAN
(grins)
Patrick me lad Im ahead of you

With a wink he reaches into his other pocket and draws up
the neck of another bottle

NOLAN

I was afraid one bottle might get
lonely by itself

(reaching into still

another pocket and

revealing still more

bottles)
Now you see the advantage of a little
man in a big coat

POP
(laughing)
Definitely Nolan my boy youre a
walkin distillery

NOLAN
I wonder how many Hail Marys the
Fatherll make me say at confession
(reflects)
Itll be worth it

The pallet is loaded now Terry turns and approaches Nolan
TERRY

(with a nervous glance
upward)

99 LISTEN— NOLAN—

NOLAN
(backing away
suspiciously)
What are you down here for— to see
we dont make off with any of Mister
Friendlys precious cargo

TERRY
(miserably)
Nolan

100 MEDIUM CLOSE—BIG MAC

Looking down into the hatch Above him we can see Specs at
the winch controls

BIG MAC
Come on Kayo get it up

101 INT—HATCH—DAY

Nolan and Pop look up at him and then back to their work
with mischievous resentment

BIG MAC
(continuing to bellow)
And dont be walking off with any of
that

You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage
102 INT—HATCH—DAY

NOLAN
(pretending to clean
out his ears)
Talk louder I cant hear you

BIG MAC
If you kept your ears wide open
instead of your mouth—

NOLAN
(shouting back)
If I talk too loud its the fault of
the nuns

BIG MAC

And what in blazes have the nuns got
to do with it

( )

102

NOLAN

(lowers his voice and

confides in the hatch

gang)
When I was a mere spit of a lad on
Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used
to say to me Nolan dont be
swallowin ye words like fishballs
When you got something to say—
(Now he shouts up at Big Mac)
—Talk with your mouth wide open so
if Im loud dont blame me— its the
fault of the nuns

Pop laughs at Big Macs expense The laughter is infectious
and sweeps the hatch Moose lets go with his loud haw haw
Everyone laughs except Terry who watches in a cold sweat

BIG MAC
(furiously from above)
Come on knock it off

The men laugh even louder

MOOSE
Haw haw— thats a good one Kayo

BIG MAC
(able to shout above
their laughter)

Knock it off Stand clear
(to Specs the
winchman above the
hatch)

All right take it away

Big Mac looks at Specs touches his cap in a signaling gesture
and nods

CLOSE—ON SPECS AT WINCH ABOVE HATCH 103

He catches the signal From below the laughter of the men
can be heard OS

CLOSE—ON CARGO SLING 104
Full of whiskey cases from angle of Kayo Nolan Pop Terry

and others watching it rise out of the hatch The general
laughter continues Terry is stiff with fear

CLOSE SHOT—SPECS 105

Suddenly he appears to lose control of the winch guiding
the up-and-down fall

CLOSE—ON NOLAN 106

Standing in the middle of the hatch looking up as the cargo
net begins to plunge downward The general laughter stops
From farther back in the hold Terry cries

TERRY
(horrified)
Nolan

And tries to pull him back out of danger Too late The
overloaded cargo net crashes down on Nolan Wood
splinters—glass shatters—and whiskey sprays Kayo Nolan is
pinned under the broken pile of cases

TOMMY
(shouting up)
Get a doctor

POP
(hard flat tone)

INT—HATCH—DAY 107
CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY 108

He stands over the body of Kayo Nolan which lies on the
pallet and has been covered by a tarpaulin

GROUP SHOT—HATCH 109

Pop Moose Luke and the others stand near him On the deck
around the hold some seventy-five longshoremen have gathered
including Big Mac

Others look down from the dock and the loft Terry is in the
same position we left him

FATHER BARRY
(aroused)
I came down here to keep a promise
I gave Kayo my word that if he stood
up to the mob Id stand up with him
all the way Now Kayo Nolan is dead
(MORE )

FATHER BARRY (CONTD)
He was one of those fellows who had
the gift of getting up But this
Time they fixed him good— unless it
was an accident like Big Mac says

Pop Moose and some of the others glare at Big Mac who
chews his tobacco sullenly Some of the others snicker
accident

FATHER BARRY
Some people think the Crucifixion
only took place on Calvary They
better wise up Taking Joey Doyles
life to stop him from testifying is
a crucifixion— Dropping a sling on
Kayo Nolan because he was ready to
spill his guts tomorrow— thats a
crucifixion Every time the mob puts
the crusher on a good man— tries to
stop him from doing his duty as a
citizen— its a crucifixion

CLOSE—ON TERRY 110
Voice of Father Barry continues

FATHER BARRY
And anybody who sits around and lets
it happen keeps silent about
something he knows has happened—
shares the guilt of it just as much
as the Roman soldier who pierced the
flesh of Our Lord to see if He was
dead

SHOT OF EDIE—ON DOCK 111

Listening moved Terry has come up behind her and stands
nearby She notices him but barely reacts He listens intently
to the Fathers words

(NOTE I am not indicating in detail the other necessary
reactions— those of Pop Moose the Negro Luke the watchful
hostility of Sonny and Truck the murderous arrogance of
Johnny Friendly and the sophisticated cynicism of Charley
Malloy But most important of all is the impression being
made on Terry)

CLOSE—ON TRUCK 112

TRUCK
Go back to your church Father

INT—HATCH—DAY 113

FATHER BARRY

(looking up at Truck

and pointing to the

ship)

CLOSE—ON SONNY 114

SONNY
Get off the dock Father

Sonny reaches for a box of rotten bananas on the dock and
flings one down into the hatch

CLOSE—ON FATHER BARRY 115
The banana splatters him but he ignores it
BACK TO SONNY—ON DOCK 116

Terry turns to him Edie notices this and watches with
approval

TERRY
Do that again and Ill flatten you
SONNY
Whatre you doing Joining them—
TERRY

SONNY

Terry
TERRY

Let him finish
Edie looks at him amazed Terry catches her eye and then
looks down embarrassed at his good deed They both turn to
watch Father Barry
CLOSE SHOT—CHARLEY 117

Near Johnny watching Terry and then looking at Johnny
apprehensively

118 INT—HATCH—DAY 118

FATHER BARRY
Every morning when the hiring boss
blows his whistle Jesus stands
alongside you in the shape-up

More missiles fly some hitting the Father but he continues

FATHER BARRY
He sees why some of you get picked
and some of you get passed over He
sees the family men worrying about
getting their rent and getting food
in the house for the wife and kids
He sees them selling their souls to
the mob for a days pay

119 CLOSE—ON JOHNNY FRIENDLY 119

Nodding to Barney Barney picks up an empty beer can and
hurls it down into the hatch

120 INT—HATCH—DAY 120

It strikes Father Barry and blood etches his forehead Pop
jumps forward and shakes his fist

POP
By Christ the next bum who throws
something deals with me I dont
care if hes twice my size

Some of the other longshoremen grumble approval

FATHER BARRY
What does Christ think of the easy-
money boys who do none of the work
and take all of the gravy What
does He think of these fellows wearing
hundred-and-fifty-dollar suits and
diamond rings— on your union dues
and your kickback money How does
He feel about bloodsuckers picking
up a longshoremans work tab and
grabbing twenty percent interest at
the end of a week

121 CLOSE-—ON JP 121

JP
Never mind about that
122 CLOSE—OF SONNY—ON DOCK

Scowling Terry nearby is increasingly moved by the

Fathers challenge

FATHER BARRY
How does He who spoke up without
fear against evil feel about your
silence

SONNY
Shut up about that

He reaches for another rotten banana and is poised to throw
it Almost simultaneously Terry throws a short hard right
that flattens Sonny neatly Edie is watching a deeply felt

gratitude in her eyes
123 CLOSE—ON JOHNNY FRIENDLY AND TRUCK
A little way off

TRUCK
You see that

Johnny presses his lips together but makes no sign
124 CLOSE—ON TERRY AND EDIE

She moves closer to him He barely glances at her
continues listening to Father Barry

125 INT—HATCH—DAY

FATHER BARRY
You want to know whats wrong with
our waterfront Its love of a lousy
buck Its making love of a buck—
the cushy job— more important than
the love of man Its forgetting
that every fellow down here is your
brother in Christ

126 CLOSE—ON POP—MOOSE—LUKE—TERRY AND EDIE
As Father Barrys voice rises to a climax—

FATHER BARRY
But remember fellows Christ is
always with you— Christ is in the
shape-up Hes in the hatch— Hes in
the union hall— Hes kneeling here

FATHER BARRY

Joey what they did to Nolan theyre
doing to you And you And YOU And
only you with Gods help have the
power to knock ‘em off for good

(turns to Nolans

corpse)
Okay Kayo

(then looks up and

says harshly)
Amen

He makes the sign of the cross Pop Moose Tommy Luke and
the others do likewise Big Mac and Specs seeing the others
reluctantly follow suit Then disgruntled Big Mac climbs

up out of the hatch and bellows

BIG MAC
All right fellows— break it up
Lets go

Strongly moved the longshoremen glare at Big Mac and then
silently start back to their places on the deck in the
hatches on the dock etc

MOVING SHOT 128

The pallet rises out of the hatch with the body on it Pop
sits casually on the edge with Father Barry who in pantomime
is cadging a cigarette

CLOSE—ON EDIE AND TERRY 129

Edie crosses herself Then she looks at Terry They look at
each other and the feeling in both of them is some terrible
hunger beyond their control For a moment it seems as if
Terry must go to her but instead he turns away slowly as
if this were the most diffi cult thing he was ever asked to
do Edie looks after him and we feel that she will yield to
impulse and call out to him But she looks down instead
finally and closes her eyes imperceptibly trembling against
desire Luke comes up to her but she is lost in her own
most private thoughts and does not see him He carries Joeys
jacket the one Nolan has been wearing

LUKE
Edie
(nudges her)
Edie—

EDIE
(startled)
Oh— Luke

LUKE
(quietly)
Joeys jacket I thought maybe Kayod
like you to have it back

Edie looks at him and takes it silently She hugs it to
her whispers Thank you and in a kind of sleepwalking
starts toward the entrance of the pier Luke watches her
anxiously

LUKE
Sure youre okay

She nods and continues on alone
QUICK DISSOLVE
130 EXT—ROOFTOP—NIGHT 130

At the pigeon coop near Terrys rooftop window Under the
window is the mattress he uses as outdoor sleeping quarters
on hot summer nights

Terry is staring in at the pigeons full of his own troubled
bestirring thoughts Edie comes up behind him almost silently
carrying the jacket

TERRY
(turning)
Edie

EDIE

(holding the coat out

to him)
I— I brought this for you Terry
It was Joeys

(her conscious self

trying to conceal

3t4the real meaning)
Yours is coming out at the elbows

( )

130 130

TERRY
(close to her— and
not really caring
what he is saying)
I dont rate it

EDIE
Go ahead wear it

From the pigeon coop comes the soft sound of pigeons cooing
as if upset

EDIE
(under her breath)
Pigeons
TERRY
Theres a hawk around Theyre scared
tonight

She looks up and huddles a little closer to him Now he
reaches out for her—groping with an unfamiliar inexorable
emotion

TERRY
Edie— I— I— never said this toa
girl before I never knew a girl
worth trying to say it for but you—
youre

EDIE
(whispering and
suddenly wiser than
he)
I know I know

He kisses her at last with pent-up violence and hunger The
sound of a deep-throated ships whistle rolls across the
river but they do not hear it There is a tremendous sense
of release and relief as their mouths and bodies press
together
FADE OUT

Father Barry looks at him

To Terrys amazement the shutter closes abruptly

FATHER BARRY
(trying to move on)
I dont want to hear it in there

I can use it where itll do the most
good

TERRY
But youve got to listen to me

( )

132

FATHER BARRY
Ill find you a priest

Father Barry starts off again Terry follows him desperately
under a terrible compulsion to bare himself to Father Barry
He grabs the Father by the arm fiercely half spinning him
around

TERRY
(with relief as he
gets it out)
Listen it was me who set Joey Doyle
up for the muggers

Father Barry stops and stares at him realizing Terry is
ready at last

FATHER BARRY
Come take a walk with me kid and
give it to me straight Theres
nothing I havent heard

They turn toward the exit of the church

—It started as a favor— for my

Who am I kiddin They call ita

TERRY

EDIE

TERRY
(plunging in)
Edie— its—

What he starts to say is drowned out by an immense prolonged
blast of the whistle from the departing ocean liner Terry
shouts his story out to Edie compulsively but we cannot hear
it over the rasping sound of the whistle Edie is horrified
as she catches enough words to realize what Terry is trying
to say The whistle pauses a moment giving us just enough

to hear Terry shout—

TERRY
Didnt know—

Then the blast of the boat whistle drowns him out again
When it finally stops Terry is finishing—

TERRY
—but dont you see Edie I never
thought theyd—

Wilson— yeah— yeah— I fought Wilson

GLOVER

unlocks him)
You want to know something— I would
have taken Wilson—

TERRY
If I licked him I would have had the
title shot instead of him— boy I

violent short breath-

releases )

VOICE OF TERRY

( )

152
EDIE
Leave me alone I want you to leave
me alone
ANGLE ON DOOR 153

The pounding grows louder Suddenly there is the sound of
the door being broken open Edie draws back against the head
of her bed pulling the covers around her Terry runs in
wild-eyed

TERRY

How can you be with Charley and Johnny
Friendly and still be with me Either

EDIE

your conscience tell you what to do

TERRY
(pounding his fist on
the bed)
That—
(pound pound )
-—word again Why do you keep saying
conscience conscience

EDIE
I never mentioned the word before

In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table

TERRY
I keep hearing it and I dont know
what to doI dont know what to
do

Without realizing what he is doing he squeezes the glass in
his powerful fist until it breaks The glass cuts his hand
He draws back in pain

TERRY
My hand

EDIE
Its just a scratch You wont die

She turns away from him

TERRY
Edie

EDIE
Get away from me

TERRY
Edie I need you to love me Tell me

EDIE

TERRY
(groping for her)

His arms move around her Her reaction is convulsive Her
hands move over him in anger and love

( ) 153

EDIE
Stay away from me
(her face close to
his)
Stay away from me—
(closer)
Stay—

They kiss lying across the bed and the fever seizes them
again

EDIE
—away from me

Then after some moments they are distracted by—
VOICE FROM THE STREET
Hey Terry come on down I got
something to show you Terry

Startled they cling to each other The voice calls again—

VOICE FROM THE STREET
Hey Terry your brothers down here

TERRY

(more curious)
Charley

EDIE
(calling after him)
Terry

She rises and calls toward the door—

EDIE
Terry

Then she runs to the window

EXT—EDIE AT WINDOW—NIGHT 154

EDIE
(calling)
Terry

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
You hear what I heard

Edie looks up and to one side
CLOSE—ON MRS COLLINS 155
Looking out another window of the tenement

MRS COLLINS
Thats the same way they called Andy
out the night I lost him

CLOSE—ON EDIE—AT WINDOW 156
Horrified Looking for Terry She runs from the window
CLOSE—ON FIRE ESCAPE—NIGHT 157

As Edie runs out onto it She looks down wildly searching
for Terry A ships whistle makes a mournful sound A great
luxury liner is heading out to the harbor Fog is drifting
in over the roof She peers down but can see nothing She
hears a wild shriek from the street and runs to the railing
again It is only a teenager whooping it up below Then she
hears shots—Bang—Bang—Bang—and the sound of a police siren
She raises her hands to her head and cries

EDIE
Terry

Then she hears the follow-up of the police siren It is only
a TV set near the open window of the floor below

TV ANNOUNCER
And now for your weekly dramatic
thrill straight from the files of
the Citys Finest— Police Patrol
(Dragnet-type music)

Edie turns away in exasperation She calls down the fire
escape into the fog

EDIE
Terry

( )

157

There is no answer Mrs Collins appears on the fire escape
in her kimono

MRS COLLINS
Dont go down

Mrs Collins tries to restrain her but Edie wrenches away—

EDIE
Terry

She starts to run hysterically down the fire escape
EXT—LANDING UNDER FIRE ESCAPE—NIGHT 158

As Edie is coming down the outside metal steps Mutt is
wandering along singing mournfully—

MUTT
Tippi-tippi-tin tippi-Tin

A window opens and an angry voice cries

LOUD VOICE
Drop dead

An old shoe is hurled at Mutt just as Edie turns toward
him

MUTT
(to the angrywindow)
Spit on me curse me and stone me
but I suffer for your sins

LOUD VOICE
Go suffer somewhere else you bum

The window bangs shut Mutt sees Edie and turns his attention
to her

MUTT
I seen it I seen them put him to
death I heard him cry out

EDIE
(impatiently— almost
hysterically)

Who Who did you see

MUTT
His executioners They was stabbing
him in his side And his soft eyes
was looking down at them

( )

158

EDIE
(desperately)
Tell me who

MUTT
(lifting his head
from his hands)
Our Lord Jesus When He died to save
us

He gropes toward her as if to paw her
EDIE
(with loathing)
Oh get away— get away
She runs on Mutt goes staggering off in the opposite
direction singing his song Edie runs on until she sees

Terry in the mist

EDIE
Terry

She runs into his arms

EDIE
Terry Im frightened More and more
frightened

TERRY

Im looking for Charley I heard

Charley was waiting for me
(calls)

Charley

There is no answer Terry frowns Edie points through the
darkness

SAME VOICE IN FOG
Wanna see Charley Hes over here

TERRY
(as they hurry forward)
Hey Charley
EXT—MEDIUM CLOSE—WHITE WALL—NIGHT 159

The headlights of a car suddenly illuminate Charley against
the wall

Charley is leaning against the lamp post in a very casual

attitude looking as dapper as usual Terry and Edie run to
him The car drives off

( )

159 159

TERRY
Looking for me Charley

Charley seems to study them silently Terry nudges him

TERRY
Hey Charley

Charley slides down the wall and crumples to the ground
Dead Edie screams Terry drops beside the body

TERRY
Hes dead Hes dead Those scummy
good-for-nuthin butchers

The lights of an approaching car catch them in its beam
Terry reacts quickly cowering against the wall and pulling
Edie down behind him protectively

TERRY
Behind me Behind me It may be them
coming back

They huddle in fear as the car comes closer then it turns
and the lights are no longer on them Terry lets out a soft
whistle of relief as the car drives off Edie is completely
panicked now

EDIE
(in a horrified whisper)
Terry lets go away

Terry takes Charleys arm which is twisted behind him and
straightens it tenderly

TERRY
Charley
EDIE
(hysterically)

I mean it lets get away from
here first Joey then Nolan now
Charley— and any minute

(stares at him almost

saying you)
-Llm frightened— Im frightened

Terry seems not to hear There are tears in his eyes but
fury in his voice as he mutters to himself

TERRY
Ill take it out of their skulls

( ) 159

EDIE
I dont want to see you killed I
want to live with you Live with
you Any place its safe to walk the
streets without

TERRY
(in a terrible mutter
to himself)
Ill take it out of their skulls

He rises in a dangerous animal rage

EDIE
Terry no no

TERRY
Dont hang on to me And dont follow
me Dont follow me
(turns )
Call the Father Ask him to take
care of Charley for me My brother
Theres something I got to do

He looks around takes note of and strides toward—
MEDIUM SHOT—PAWN SHOP—NIGHT 160

A little way down the block An iron grille protects the
windows Terry goes up to the grille and looks in Edie
follows him anxiously

CLOSE SHOT—PAWN SHOP WINDOW—THROUGH GRILLE—NIGHT 161

There are watches rings fishing rods guitars cameras
musical instruments suits furs bowler hats and—about two
feet back from the window—a 45 revolver in a holster and a
belt of cartridges

TERRY
(muttering)
They put a hole in Charley Ill put
holes in them

Edie sees what Terry is after and tries to restrain him

EDIE
Terry go home Theres nothing you
can do now Its locked up

Terry looks at her unseeingly then drives the toe of his
shoe through the diamond shaped opening in the grille and
through the glass behind it

INT—PAWN SHOP WINDOW—NIGHT 162

Shooting toward Terry the coveted revolver in the FG
Terrys fingers cannot quite reach it He has to press his
shoulder painfully against the jagged glass in order to inch
closer to it He contorts his face in pain as the glass cuts
through his jacket into his flesh Blood begins to dampen
his shoulder but with a final effort he gets his fingers
around the gun

EXT—PAWN SHOP—NIGHT 163

As Terry draws the gun from the window and slips it into his
pocket Edie sees the blood dripping from the rip in his
jacket

EDIE
Terry youre bleeding

TERRY
(in a flat tone)
Do what I told you Take care of
Charley

EDIE
Terry for Gods sake

TERRY
Get out of my way

EDIE
No I cant let you I cant youre—

She clings to him sobbing

TERRY
(violently)
I dont want to hurt you but out
of my way

He flings her from him and goes on loading the gun as she
sobbingly watches him go off

INT—FRIENDLY BAR—NIGHT 164

As Terry enters The usual crowd are present Barney Specs
Sonny Truck JP etc There is a comedian on TV and
everyone is laughing but the laughter dies at the sight of
Terry He goes up to the bar tensely Everyone watches in
silence There is a suggestion of men feeling for their guns
but nobody moves

( )

164 164
TERRY

(to bartender)
Is Johnny in

JOCKO
No
TERRY
(suspiciously)
No

To see for himself Terry strides through to the back room
and throws open the door The back room is empty Then he
takes a seat at the bar so he can watch the room and the
entrance The customers eye him carefully

TERRY
(to Jocko)
Give me a double

JOCKO
Take it easy now Terry

TERRY
Keep the advice Give me the whiskey

Jocko sets the drink up He notices the jagged tear in Terrys
jacket and the spreading stain of blood from the shoulder

JOCKO
Whats wrong with your shoulder

TERRY
(draining his glass)
Hit me again

JOCKO
(in an undertone)
Listen kid why dont you go home
before Johnny

Terry pushes his empty pony glass forward for another one

TERRY
(sharply)
No advice Just whiskey

JOCKO
(pouring it)
Easy Easy boy

ANOTHER ANGLE—TOWARD ENTRANCE 165

Footsteps are heard outside the swinging doors Terry turns
to face the entrance his hand going to the gun in his pocket
Sonny Truck Barney and others all watch him ready for

the draw Jocko automatically crosses himself and turns off
the TV which is now only an irritant The swinging doors
open but its not Johnny Just a couple of happy waterf

ront barfl ies But the moment they enter their grins vanish
as they are made to feel the tension They look at Terry

then they look at the goons watching Terry

JOCKO
(to the newcomers )
Whatll you have

NEWCOMER
Thanks just the same

The two men bolt out the doorway In the silence we hear the
creaking of the ancient swinging doors The silence is
oppressive Terry works his hand over his bleeding shoulder

JOCKO
You ought to go home and take care
of that—
TERRY
(watching the doorway
growls)

First things first
Once more steps are heard on the sidewalk outside the bar
Once more everyone is on edge for the showdown between Terry
and Johnny All eyes are on the swinging doors

MEDIUM CLOSE—SWINGING DOORS—NIGHT 166

Father Barry enters followed by Moose Tommy Luke CAMERA
goes with Father Barry as he walks right up to Terry

FATHER BARRY
I want to see you Terry

TERRY
You got eyes Im right in front of

FATHER BARRY

TERRY
What do you want from me Father

( )

166

FATHER BARRY
(putting out his hand)

TERRY
Mind your own business Father

FATHER BARRY
This is my business

TERRY
Why dont you go and chase yourself

FATHER BARRY
(slowly) Give me that gun

TERRY
You go to hell

FATHER BARRY
(advancing)
What did you say

TERRY
(just a trifle
disconcerted)

You go to—

Father Barry throws a good right hand punch that catches
Terry by surprise and knocks him down Terry rises feeling
his shoulder which is oozing blood now and weakening him
He charges Father Barry like a tormented animal

TERRY
Why you

Moose and Luke grab him although Father Barry waits calmly

TOMMY
(to Terry)
Get wise to yourself you bum

The word hits him Terry drops his hands slowly weaving as
if weak from loss of blood

TERRY
(chastened)
Take your hands off me What you
call me

( ) 166

FATHER BARRY

(to Terry)
A bum Look what youre doing You
want to be brave Firing lead into
another mans flesh isnt brave Any
bum who picks up a 45 in a pawn
shop can be that brave You want to
hurt Johnny Friendly You want to
fix him for what he did to Charley—
and a dozen men who were better than
Charley Dont fight him like a
hoodlum down here in the jungle
Thats just what he wants Hell hit
you in the head and plead self-
defense Fight him tomorrow in the
courtroom— with the truth as you
know it— Truth is the gun— Drop
that thing and tell the truth—a
more dangerous weapon than this little-

(reaches into Terrys

pocket and removes

the gun as he talks)
—cap pistol

The two men look at each other Father Barrys words cut
him

FATHER BARRY
That is if youve got the guts If
you havent you better hang on to
this

Father Barry offers the gun back to Terry contemptuously
Terry takes the gun and holds it self-consciously

FATHER BARRY
You want a beer
(to Jocko)
Two beers

Jocko sets them up and Father Barry and Terry drink them
off looking at each other The drink seems to refresh Terry
He turns around to Jocko and slams the gun down on the bar

Behind the bar is a large picture in the place of honor
showing Johnny Friendly arm-in-arm with Mr Upstairs
beaming with self-confidence

TERRY

Father there is one thing Id like
to do

( ) 166

So saying he takes his revolver and hurls it into the face
of the picture

TERRY
(feeling better)
Tell Johnny I was here

Terry looks around defiantly at the tense gunmen—and starts
out with Father Barry and the group

MEDIUM CLOSE—JOCKO—BEHIND BAR 167

Watching Terry leave Breathing a sigh of relief as he picks
up the gun

Then he catches the dark looks of Sonny Truck Barney etc
and busies himself at the bar

beside a rich leather chair and a strong manicured hand
wearing an expensive ring picks up the glass

VOICE OF BUTLER

voice)

bodyguards who lead him toward the chamber behind the court-

( )

room As he steps into the aisle Johnny Friendly leaps up
from a long bench facing the aisle

They lead

roughly separated by court room guards

Terry enters Edies voice follows him as she trails behind
him He sits on the bed and looks at the cargo hook hung on
a peg on the wall

EDIE
Doesnt that make sense

Terry doesnt answer He takes the cargo hook from the wall
and jabs it viciously into the floor

EDIE
I dont think youre even listening
to me

He pulls the cargo hook out and jabs it into the floor again

EDIE
are you

He looks up at her frowns and then studies the cargo hook
tapping it into his hand with pent-up feeling The feeling
is a strong and infectious one Edie senses it and accuses
him—

EDIE
Youre going down there

He looks up at her again for a moment and then works his
hand over the handle of the hook

EDIE
(her voice rising)
Just because Johnny warned you not
to youre going down there arent
you

He doesnt say anything but the determination in him seems
to be constantly mounting

EDIE
You think youve got to prove
something to them dont you
(MORE )

( )

183

EDIE (CONTD)
That you are not afraid of them and—
you wont be satisfied until you
walk right into their trap will
you

His silence maddens her She seems on the verge of striking
him out of frustration and impotent rage Her voice is
hysterical—

EDIE
Then go ahead— go ahead Go down to
the shape-up and get yourself killed
you stupid pigheaded son of a—
(struggles to control
herself)
What are you trying to prove

With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it
through his belt Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joeys
windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging He
puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way and grins at
her as he does so then he walks to the door with a sense of
dignity he has never had before

TERRY

(quietly)
You always said I was a bum Well—

(points to himself)

as if relieved)
Your guts is all in your wallet and
your trigger finger

to beat Johnny to the deck Both of their faces are bloody
and hideously swollen

But they still hang back intimidated by Johnny Friendly and
his muscle

Surrounded by longshoremen ignoring
Stevedores command tries to drive
them on

JOHNNY

shoving him forward)
Come on you

From force of habit Pop begins to comply Then he catches
himself and turns on Johnny

POP
(sounding more sad
than angry)
All my life you pushed me around

Suddenly he shoves Johnny off the ramp into the water scummy
with oil slick and riverbank debris

EDIE
(to Father Barry)
Theyre waiting for him to walk in

FATHER BARRY

JOHNNY
(in BG shouts)

Friendlys voice acts as a prod on Terry

TERRY
(dazed)
Get me on my feet

They make an effort to pick him up He can barely stand He
looks around unseeingly

TERRY
Am I on my feet

EDIE
Terry

FATHER BARRY

Blood oozing from his wounds Terry sways uncomprehendingly

FATHER BARRY

lips)

EDIE
(screams at Father
Barry)
What are you trying to do

ANGLE—ON RAMP
As the groggy Terry starts up the
ramp Edie reaches out to him Father
Barry holds her back

FATHER BARRY
Leave him alone Take your hands off
him— Leave him alone

Staggering moving painfully forward Terry starts up the
ramp Edies instinct is to help him but Father Barry knowing
the stakes of this symbolic act holds her back Terry
stumbles but steadies himself and moves forward as if driven
on by Father Barrys will

TERRY APPROACHING PIER ENTRANCE 202

As he staggers forward as if blinded the longshoremen form
a line on either side of him awed by his courage waiting
to see if hell make it Terry keeps going

REVERSE ANGLE—BOSS STEVEDORE—TERRYS POV 203

Waiting at pier entrance as Terry approaches Shot out of
focus as Terry would see him through bloody haze

TERRY 204

As the men who have formed a path for him watch intently
Terry staggers up until he is face to face with the Stevedore
He gathers himself as if to say Im ready Lets go

STEVEDORE
(calls officially)
All right— lets go to work

As Terry goes past him into the pier the men with a sense
of inevitability fall in behind him

JOHNNY FRIENDLY
Hurrying forward in a last desperate
effort to stop the men from following
Terry in

JOHNNY
(screams )
Where you guys goin Wait a minute

As they stream past him

JOHNNY
Ill be back I1l be back And I1l
remember every last one of ya

He points at them accusingly But they keep following Terry
into the pier

WIDER ANGLE—PIER ENTRANCE 205

As Father Barry and Edie look on Stevedore blows his whistle
for work to begin Longshoremen by the hundreds march into

the pier behind Terry like a conquering army In the bG A
frenzied Johnny Friendly is still screaming Ill be back
Ill be back The threat real as it is is lost in the
forward progress of Terry and the ragtail army of dock workers
he now leads

FADE OUT

THE END
