FADE IN

EXT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY - SOMEWHERE IN OREGON - DUSK

The western horizon is bruised and purple punctuated by
distant lightning Rain is coming The last hint of sun fades
into darkness as cars swish by the tall pines and thick brush
along the interstate

The rain starts Sixteen-wheelers zoom by Cars turn on their
headlights one by one

INTEXT A VOLVO WAGON - LATER
The rains coming harder now And its gotten dark

Headlights blind the driver CHRISTINE BECK (30s) long
brunette hair freckles a pretty face lined with fatigue and
worry Wipers work overtime

ELIJAH (0S)
Doing okay mom

ELIJAH BECK is awake beside her She glances at him and
smiles tiredly

ELIJAH
Want me to take over

Christine laughs softly

CHRISTINE
Nice try

ELIJAH
Im gonna get my permit in a few months
you know

CHRISTINE
(looking in the rearview)
Uh-huh

Three kids fast asleep in the back in her carseat redheaded
JOURNIE (18 mos) and beside her SIERRA tousled blond
hair matted with sleep and DYLAN his sweet face rosy
with sleep as he clutches a red remote control car

ELIJAH (0S)
Mom Look out

Brakes squeal as Christine swerves On the shoulder an
ACCIDENT SCENE flashing lights ambulances a fire-engine
ELIJAH
(craning his neck)
Whoa

Christine allows her eyes to flicker to the horrible wreck
Mangled cars and two bodies lie under a sheet in the road

Blurred by the rain the pale face of a LITTLE BOY as he
peers out the back window of one of the cars They pass as he
tracks them in SLO-MO He lifts a hand Then hes gone

EXT SEATTLE - GREEN LAKE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

The sun shines down on beautiful gardens and lovingly-
restored old houses Its early morning The streets are
deserted and damp after a late-night rain

The Volvo comes down the street and pulls into the gravel
driveway of a two-storey white clapboard in need of a paint
job Wide porch brick pathway A SOLD sign in the lawn

The Beck family wearily gets out of the car Rumpled and
groggy the kids stretch and grouse

An exhausted Christine brightens as she looks at her new home
just as a truck - DELANCEY STREET MOVING BERKELEY - noisily
pulls up to the house Two DRIVERS hop out

DRIVER 1
(to Christine)
Get here okay

CHRISTINE
Perfect

With a noisy clatter the movers slide open the back of the
truck and start shifting furniture and boxes to the house
Christine walks toward the porch

A BLACK CAT hops out of the Volvo Sierra gives chase

SIERRA
Mr Baggins

Dylan has wandered unnoticed to the house next door A large
picture window is just his height He shades his eyes gets
on his toes

ELIJAH (0S)
Im claiming my room first

SIERRA (0S)
No way
Dylans face reflects on the glass and all he can see is
himself Closer Closer

Suddenly - ANOTHER FACE is superimposed on his--that of a
pale boy about his age Dylan gasps and stumbles back He
runs toward his family He looks back The window is empty

INT CHRISTINES HOUSE - NIGHT

The family sits on boxes and eats greasy pizza Exhausted and
dirty

SIERRA

nutritious

ELIJAH

(under his breath)

SIERRA

She wipes her mouth with a napkin

CHRISTINE
Oh geez Wheres Dylan

She rises glances up the stairs

SIERRA

Christine turns sharply Shes so exhausted

CHRISTINE

Sierra mimics her under her breath But Christines already
looking for her youngest son

CHRISTINE (CONTD)

Elijah elbows her She rubs her side
SIERRA

Christine heads up the stairs She reaches the -
LANDING

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
Hey Dyl

A small red REMOTE-CONTROLLED CAR zips out of one of the
rooms and as if seeing her stops turns speeds back in

Christine looks into a room
BEDROOM

Standing by the window is DYLAN a radio-control box in his
hands He seems so small in the empty room

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
Hey buddy Why arent you downstairs

DYLAN

Thundering silence Christine gets down on her haunches

CHRISTINE
(softly)
We all miss daddy honey

DYLAN
Then why did we gotta move

CHRISTINE
Baby Mommy needs some help right now
Things without daddy are kind of tough
Aunt Susan lives here and shes gonna be

DYLAN
Why didnt we stay at the old house and
wait for Daddy

He tears up Christine holds him tight
CHRISTINE
Shhhhhhh We gotta stick together Dyl

Christine gently wipes away his tears The phone rings
downstairs
DOWNSTAIRS - MINUTES LATER

Elijah and Sierra bicker over the last pizza slices
Christine is on the phone

Christine grabs a knife and opens the box She lifts out a
blue ceramic pie pan

PEGGY

Christine smiles Reaches in the box again A framed photo
She gazes at it
PEGGY

Dylans behind them his remote-control car in his hand He
glances at the neighbors house nervously

SIERRA
You know we could just show up and
theyd still have to teach us

Christine Journie on her hip steps out and locks the door

CHRISTINE
Sierra I have to fill out all those

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
Sierra Enough Okay

Christine hands Journie to Sierra

SIERRA

Sierra secures Journie in her car seat Elijah fiddles with
his iPod

Forms in hand Christine peers in to see if all are buckled
INSIDE THE CAR

ELIJAH
(to Dylan)

But his eyes dart back to the house
OUTSIDE THE CAR

Christine grabs her coffee off the hood
SIERRA (0S)

CHRISTINE
(exasperated)

She turns and GASPS -

A grizzled weatherbeaten MAN (60s) in ragged clothes a
John Deere cap right behind her

JENKINS

He grins It takes her a beat to calm down

CHRISTINE
Can I help you
JENKINS

Christine takes a step back Sour whiskey breath

CHRISTINE

JOAN (0OS)
Jack Jack why dont you leave her

JOAN HARTFORD (30s) crisp blond waspish to a fault comes
down the steps of the house next door a NY Times tucked
under one arm a coffee in hand

Jack takes a deferential step back as Joan approaches
JOAN (CONT ’D)
(gently but firmly)
Thats enough Jack Okay

Jack stares at Joan suspiciously

JOAN (CONT ’D)
Jack

Reluctantly he gets on a rusty bike and rides off pulling a
cart of gardening tools Christine watches him pedal away
Joans friendly gaze stays on Christine

One of the forms slips from Christines hand flutters away
Joan quickly fetches it
JOAN
Ah yes The dreaded school medical form

She hands it over

Joan touches Christines hand

JOAN (CONTD)

Christine smiles

CHRISTINE

ELIJAH
Mom Mom lets go

All eyes are on Christine Sierra wrenches out of her grasp
and runs toward the car In the horrible silence Christine
gathers up Journie takes Dylans hand and tries to walk away
with a shred of dignity

A WOMAN dark glasses coiffed blond hair sits on a bench
beyond the fence Motionless Watching A FATHER steps in

She sighs Picks up a large framed photograph Its the Beck

red-faced with effort But shes keeping pace She checks her
watch Rounds a corner waves to a passing CYCLIST Swerves
around a barking beagle

On almost every telephone pole bright flyers announce the
upcoming BLOCK PARTY in cute lettering with home-grown
graphics of balloons and pumpkins

Christine rips one off to hang on to as she heads home when
she notices just out of her periphery a car pacing her
Christine quickens her pace The car speeds up too

Then the car HONKS Startled Christine turns - A Jeep Grand
Cherokee has pulled up in front of her house Its Josh

INTEXT VOLVO - LATER

A steady light rain starts to fall as afternoon gives way to
evening Christine listens to music on the radio Switches on
the wipers In the backseat rosy-cheeked Journie is fast
asleep in the grip of her low-fever

A long line of traffic ahead brake-lights and just over the
crest of a hill the telltale blue and red lights of police
activity

Christine sips a coffee and sighs

CHRISTINE

Grudgingly Christine lets him take Journie He takes a
couple of steps back while Christine steps forward The
detective nods to a paramedic Slowly he unzips the bag
Christine looks then staggers back doubles over and
wretches

The battered bloody face of Stephanie slowly disappears as
the body bag is zipped up again

EXT JOANS HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS

Christine tries Joans front door Locked Heads around the
side for the back door Locked

The sound of SHATTERING GLASS

INT JOANS KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Christine steps cautiously in

CHRISTINE

(tentatively)
Dylan

She goes to the
FOYER
Looks up the stairs The house is gloomy in the fading
evening light A clock ticks in one of the rooms She goes
back to the
KITCHEN
And finds the door to the basement Presses her ear against

it Tries the doorknob It opens And creaks And she winces
at the noise

INT BASEMENT STAIRS - EVENING

Christine reaches in finds a light switch Click Looks down
into the basement Cautiously heads down the narrow stairs
all shadows and skewed perspective

CHRISTINE
Dylan

A stench repels Christine She covers her mouth and nose with
her arm and continues down

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
Dyl

She steps into the windowless room She feels for a light
switch Click

INT BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

A dim bulb hangs naked from a ceiling fixture Rusted metal
shelves hold old paint cans boxes of nails household tools
Cardboard boxes are stacked here and there

An old broken rocking-horse in one corner A babys wheeled
stroller covered in an elaborate spiderweb a large brown
spider in its center

An old couch brown stains on its cover On it a blanket
covers what could be someone sleeping

Christine approaches the sofa Its obvious someone small - a
child perhaps - is asleep there

CHRISTINE
Hey - you okay You awake

She goes to touch his shoulder The blanket slides off the
body shifts and rolls to face her -

Eyeless his mouth open in a silent scream its the
DECOMPOSING BODY OF A LITTLE BOY Remnants of clothes cling
to what remains of his skin His light-up sneakers start
flashing

Christine staggers backward regains her balance puts her
fist to her mouth

She hears a faint noise from a room above Footsteps A
thump Her body heaves with panicked breaths

THE KITCHEN

The basement door opens quietly slowly Christine peers
into the dim kitchen Beyond the windows she can see the
lights of her house She takes a deep breath and slowly edges
her way around the corner into the

DINING ROOM
Full of shadows as night approaches The clock ticks

Dylans voice - words blurred - whine and tumble down the
stairs reach his mothers ears

JOAN (VO)
(muffled)
Dylan I dont want to do this either
but Ryan has to get better
Dylan replies - but its just scared crying sounds

Christines eyes widen She heads for the stairway She
starts to edge her way up the unlighted stairs

The sound of Dylan crying
JOAN (VO) (CONTD)
Of course it wont hurt Now hurry up
Ryan cant wait much longer
Christine reaches the

LANDING

Dead quiet She looks down the hallway The only door thats
shut is to Ryans room

She stretches her hand to reach the doorknob turns it
gently pushes it open

DYLAN (VO)

JOAN (VO)
Stop it Just -

Silence Christine looks up at the ceiling
CHRISTINE

(whispers )
Oh no -

INT ATTIC STAIRS - EVENING

The door opens slicing into the darkness Christine starts
up the stairs fast and quiet as she can Shes shaking her
breathing is ragged

INT THE ATTIC - SECONDS LATER

The door swings open slowly A typical attic from this
angle Clothes boxes stacks of photograph albums a single
bare bulb very dusty Its a store-house of antiques junk
and discarded furniture

Two cracked full-length mirrors lean up against the wall The
mirrors catch and reflect disjointed images of the attic And
Dylan Sprawled Unconscious

Christine cries out -

CHRISTINE
Dylan

- when suddenly her words are choked by a ROPE ACROSS HER
THROAT pulled tight She chokes grasps at it eyes bulging

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
(gasping to speak)
Whatwhat did you -

JOAN
Dont be rude Billy Say hello to Mrs
Beck

A frightened little BOY same age as Dylan appears in
Christines line of view Hes a bit rumpled and pale around
the gills

BILLY WINBROOK
(softly)
Hello

Christines eyes bulge in recognition

CHRISTINE
(panting gasping)
Billy - Winbrook

JOAN
I told him his mommy said he could stay
with me for a while Kid couldnt get
enough ice-cream And its amazing how
much he slept

BILLY WINBROOK
(softly)
Can I Please can I go now

Christine claws and scrapes to get free

JOAN
Sure Go ahead You cant help Ryan
Billy But its okay Im not
disappointed are you Ryan

Reflected in both mirrors disjointed Ryan stands ina
corner his dark eyes wide He shakes his head

JOAN (CONTD)
But Dylan here
(beat)
Now hesthe perfect donor

Billy takes an awkward step then another Hes weak
terrified Then he races toward the door to the attic -

BILLY WINBROOK
Mommy MOM

KISH - shattering the mirrors on his way out He THUNDERS
down the stairs and it is then - just then - that Christine
gathers her strength and ELBOWS Joan in the stomach OOF

Joan stumbles back Christine scuttles to the broken mirror
grabs a shard and holds it out in front of her Edges toward
Dylan Reaches out for him

CHRISTINE
What did you do to him Joan

JOAN
Jenkins I have no patience for people
who get out of line I took care of him

Christine doesnt have time to take that in for more than a
nanosecond -

CHRISTINE
Dylan What did you do to Dylan

Eyes still on Joan Christine feels Dylans forehead Joan
touches her ribs that hurt

JOAN
Oh Christine dont overreact He wont
feel a thing

CHRISTINE
Cmon baby Wake up Wake UP

Joan smiles and moves closer to Christine The shard of
mirror doesnt seem so effective suddenly

CHRISTINE
Joanwere friends right

JOAN
You know how much I like you Christine
And your whole family

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
So - what are you planning to do Joan

JOAN
What am I planning to

Joan stares at this utterly stupid human being before her

JOAN (CONTD)
I told you We moved up on the donor
list That means Ryan is number one

A look of horrified realization sweeps over Christines face
Joan keeps moving toward her slowly

JOAN (CONTD)
Billy had the wrong blood type But he
made a nice little playmate for Ryan

CHRISTINE
How do you know Dylan has the right one

JOAN
(smiles )
I saw his school medical form when you
dropped it O-negative Exactly the same

CHRISTINE
Joan you cant be serious about this

JOAN
Do you know what a special hell those
waiting lists are God You do
everything You beg your doctor you
offer money but no no no Rules
Doesnt matter who you are

Dylan is breathing shallowly Christine thinks Thinks
Thinks And fast - because Joan is moving toward her
inexorably And shes picked up a crowbar

CHRISTINE
Oh Joan I cant imagine
JOAN
Stupid fucking doctors
CHRISTINE
Yes -
JOAN
They dont care Hes just a number to
them
CHRISTINE

But he was your baby

JOAN
Yes
(beat)
He was my baby My son

CHRISTINE
Not a number

JOAN
No And my doctor says I can never have
another Did you know that Christine
Did I tell you that Not that you can
replace a child

CHRISTINE
No Joan You cant

Christine takes a step forward to get between Dylan and Joan
The crowbar is raised now Joan looks down

JOAN
I know sweetie Mommys trying

Christine looks Nothing there But Joan looks down at Ryan
clinging to her leg

CHRISTINE
Joan I - I know how you feel When Steve
died I felt like I was buried under an
avalanche Like the world just went
white Like the world stopped Like I
stopped

JOAN
Yes
CHRISTINE
I understand that kind of pain Its the
worst thing in the world But you have to
believe me It gets better

JOAN
Bullshit

CHRISTINE
No - it does I mean its not easy The
kids and I we

Christine eyes the crowbar

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
fight a lot And I dont always know
what to say but you know were better
today than we were a few months ago It
takes time

JOAN
Oh Christine Youre right

Joan puts down the crowbar slowly Next to Dylan Because

thats how close she is Christines eyes widen her

breathing is fast and shallow

Almost sensuously Joan moves into Christines arms

We cant

CHRISTINE
(panicked)
Yes Time And - and I can help you

Joan

JOAN
Oh Christine Youre so right

CHRISTINE
(relieved)
Its okay Joan Its okay now

see Joans face

JOAN
(limply)
Yes

CHRISTINE
You can get through this I know you can
Just like I did Like I am

JOAN
You really think I can

Behind Christines back Joan looks down at the glass in
Christines hand

CHRISTINE
I know you can And I know what its
like To walk around with everyone
looking at you Pitying you And you
start to be that person

Joan moves a hand toward the glass shard

CHRISTINE
That people pity But you dont have to
Joan Screw them You can be happy -

Christine stiffens in Joans arms

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
Oh God -

Joan lets Christine slide to the floor The mirror shard
sticks out of her back Her blouse darkens with blood

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
(in pain)
No -

Joan looks down at her with contempt

JOAN
Spare me your psych-class bullshit

She turns

JOAN (CONT ’D)
Its time Ryan We have to hurry to the
hospital so the doctors can get right to
work

Joan stoops and picks up Dylan in her arms Christine
watches not able to move -

Joan turns and heads for the attic door Ryan in one hand
clutching Dylan with the other when - she stumbles and cries
out Joan looks down

A sharp shard of mirror protrudes from her calf Christine
lies at her feet breathing shallowly the glass still stuck
in her own back

CHRISTINE
(with difficulty)
Give me my son you bitch

Joan tries to manoeuver Dylan so she can limp out the attic
door but

JOAN
Oh my God

-another shard is planted in her leg Christines strength
is waning fast

Joan staggers and Dylan slips from her arms with a WHUMP

CHRISTINE
(in pain)
Dylan

Dylan moans starts to come to slightly Joan bends over and
WRENCHES the glass out of her calf with a wet sound She
stands over Christine holds the glass like a dagger

JOAN
I will not lose my child Christine You
of all people should understand that

CHRISTINE
Joan -

Shes dizzy - losing bloodJoan kneels down next to
Christine the glass at her throat

JOAN
What sweetie Come on

Christine can barely form words

CHRISTINE
Ryan

Joan presses the glass to Christines throat A thin line of
blood forms

CHRISTINE (CONTD)
Hes dead Joan Hes dead

Joan stares at Christine with venom A long moment
JOAN
Dont you ever say that Dont you ever

say that

Ryan looks up at his mommy imploringly but his image
flickers weakens

CHRISTINE (0S)
(suddenly)
You arent listening to me Joan Your
son is dead

CRACK the crowbar SMASHES across Joans face Sends her
staggering blood flying from her mouth Christines on her
feet and in no mood for any more bullshit

JOAN (CONTD)
You -

And she stumblestrips over Dylan anddisappears from
sight Just like that The sickening disjointed sound of a
body crashing down the stairs

Weakly Christine drops to her knees nears her son Checks
his pulse Hes gonna be bruised but he seems okay

Holding the door frame Christine stands reaches - yanks the
glass out of her back Stoops over Dylan - God the pain -
puts a limp arm over her shoulder and weakly shuffles toward
the attic door

Outside the sound of sirens Christine looks down the
stairs Joan is sprawled out at the bottom like a rag doll

Christine picks her way down the stairs with Dylan Pounding
on the front door

POLICE (V0O)
Open up Police

Christine fights to keep her balance perilously as she
tries to step over Joan Just as she does - Joan grabs her
wrist Christine gasps and stumbles

With an amazingly strong grasp Joan pulls Christine down to
her And closer Until her lips are in Christines ear The
skin on Christines neck rises and falls

JOAN
(a whisper)
Im looking for my son Have youseen
him

Christine lays Dylan down gently and sinks down beside Joan
She puts Joans head in her lap Blood comes out of Joans
nose ears

CHRISTINE
Oh Joan

Joan shifts and moans slightly Downstairs more pounding
The sound of wood breaking

JOAN
--Ryan

CHRISTINE
Shhhhh Ryans with you now Joan

JOAN
Oh hi baby

Joan smiles ever so slightly Its a beautiful smile
And her last breath escapes her An avalanche of silence

POLICEMAN (0S)
Maam Maam we dont have a pulse here

Christines eyes go wide with shock Because they cant be
talking about Joan She looks up The cop has Dylan in his
arms

CHRISTINE
Dylan -

As the cop rushes the boys body down the stairs Christine
tries to follow leaving a bloody smear on the wall
INT JOANS LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

CHRISTINE
Dylan

PARAMEDIC
Maam Maam I need you to sit down
right over there

And she passes out - into his arms
