INT GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 1

A mediocre-looking teenage boy GREG is staring in frozen
horror at a computer monitor the only source of illumination
in the room

He is lost in thought and his thoughts are hell

GREG (VO)
I have no idea how to tell this
story

He types His typing is labored

GREG (VO)
I don’t even know how to start it
Like I guess I could use one of
those classic story-beginning
sentences

He examines the screen There’s one line written “It was the
best of times it was the worst of times”

GREG (VO)
(becoming agitated)
But what would that even mean I
mean obviously somewhere in the
world it’s the best of times for
someone

CUT TO

INT SOME GUY’S LIVING ROOM - DAY 2

Some EXTREMELY FORTUNATE GUY is benefitting from all these
things that Greg is describing

GREG (VO)
Like he’s eating all of this insane
Vietnamese food that he just got
for free and the woman who
delivered the food looks exactly
like the hot girl from Pussy Riot
and now she’s situated in the
corner playing unspeakably
beautiful melodies on the harp
While he’s just going to town on
that food So yeah That’s the best
of times Meanwhile

CUT TO

INT NORTH KOREAN DUNGEON - NIGHT - ALTHOUGH WHO REALLY KNOWS
WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS IN THIS HORRIBLE GODDAMNED DUNGEON

A COMPARABLY UNFORTUNATE GUY is the recipient of Greg’s
imagined parade of horrors

GREG (VO)

-some other guy is being tortured
by the North Korean government
specifically by being suspended
over a crocodile-infested pool of
acid and because it’s acid these
crocodiles are just pissed and
they’re also piping in that gross
smell you get when they spill a
bunch of milk in the school parking
lot and this beefy torturer dude
is just punching the hell out of
him Worst of times Check

BACK TO

INT GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 4

GREG stares screenward He has typed the words “I have no
idea what I am doing”

He erases them and begins typing again
GREG (VO)

All right Look I’1l just start
This is the story of my senior year
of high school and how it
destroyed my life and how I made a
film so bad it literally killed
someone

Greg finishes typing The screen says

“I made a film so bad it literally killed someone”

Greg is staring blankly at the screen again

SUPER The part where I begin senior year

CUT TO

IE SCHENLEY HIGH SCHOOL - BEFORE CLASS 6pt
Schenley High School is a stately formidable city block of
barred windows and desert-colored brick It’s a bit like they
made a penitentiary out of a dismantled Gaza pyramid

As GREG walks through the school - down hallways in and out
of the band room etc - we trail him

IN THE FOYER 6pt
Greg approaches a lone JOCK
GREG (VO)
I used to think about it this way
Like a continent Schenley High
School is divided into nations

Greg and the jock exchange what’s-up head nods

GREG (VO)
Jock Nation

IN A VAST GRITTY HALLWAY 6pt

Greg bumps fists with TWO STONERS smoothly declining their
offer to look at a YOUTUBE VIDEO

GREG (VO)
Kingdom of Stoners

FURTHER DOWN THE HALLWAY 6pt

JUSTIN HOWELL THE THEATER KID is laughing uproariously and
flirtatiously at a thing Greg has said

GREG (VO)
The People’s Republic of Theater
Dorks
IN THE STAIRWELL 6pt

Greg observes unnoticed as two STONERS pelt a JOCK with
ketchup packets and then book it out of there

GREG (VO)
In the typical high school life

you belong to one nation which can
never guarantee you total security

IN THE HALLWAY 6pt

Blue 4

A group of GANGBANGERS smoking cigarettes exchanges sullen
what’s-up nods with Greg

GREG (VO)
But I thought I found a way out
Get citizenship in EVERY nation
Get passports to EVERYWHERE

IN THE BAND ROOM 6pt

Greg briefly plays the bass drum in an impromptu jam session
with FOUR OR FIVE BAND KIDS

GREG (VO)

Just be on low-key good terms with
everyone Casually interact with
them once in a while in a way that
is invisible to everyone else

IN ANOTHER HALL 7

Three MEDIOCRE-LOOKING GIRLS are in GREG’S path One is
quietly but utterly miserable

FRIEND OF MISERABLE GIRL
The test was today

The miserable girl nods wordless her friends hug her
fiercely protectively

GREG (VO)

Never commit to an interaction that
wont be casual or mellow That’s
like sending troops to Afghanistan

GREG
(cheerily hastily)
Ugh Tests I’ve been there

He speeds away--
IN THE AUDITORIUM 8

GREG is watching with polite interest as two GOTHY DORKS
including SCOTT MAYHEW play Magic cards

GREG (VO)

Maintain relationships even with
citizens of the most dicked-upon
nations For example Scott Mayhew
the Gothy dork I’m sitting next to
here It took years of cultivation
to win his trust

Scott plays a card entitled “Common Highland Berserker”

GREG
(murmuring respectfully)
Scott nice berserker

Icy and sinister Scott turns his gaze to Greg

SCOTT MAYHEW
Thank you--

PARKING LOT STEPS 9

GREG is patiently listening to the violent freestyle rapping
of ILL PHIL a runty neck-tattooed ne’er-do-well

GREG (VO)
Or the universally ostracized I1l
Phil Truly a nation of one

ILL PHIL
They call me I11 Phil
Ill bend you to my will
my will is ill
and my name is Phil
for real

GREG
Yeah that’s good

ILL PHIL
(interrupting him)
take you out back behind the mill
force you to eat a pill
now you like “what’s the deal”
“IT just got killed”

GREG
Some great rhymes in there
FREEZE FRAME

GREG (VO)
This all may appear simple

REWIND to the FRONT STEPS of school where this scene begaipt

GREG (VO)
In fact it requires thousands of
social calculations per second

REPLAY the interactions with the JOCK and the STONERS again
in slo-mo but this time from GREG’S POV - ROBOGREG sequence

In his field of vision are SCI-FI VISUALS bars and charts
It’s the data with which a high-functioning autistic person
might negotiate the terrifying social world of high school

INT CAFETERIA -— LUNCHTIME 10

GREG holding a bagged lunch is standing inconspicuously at
the entrance of the cafeteria He is peering at A PLACE OF
TOTAL CHAOS crowded dirty and lawless

GREG (VO)
And there were some places I simply
couldn’t go Like the cafeteria
Every last square inch of it was
disputed territory It was Crimea
Kashmir and the Gaza strip all
rolled into one Also the part of
the Indian Ocean with pirates

INT MCCARTHY’S OFFICE 11

GREG is eating his lunch in a teacher’s office next toa
DIMINUTIVE BLACK KID Above them stands MR MCCARTHY a young
teacher with a shaved head and arms sheathed in tattoos He
is notable for his paradoxically mellow intensity and for
his LOVE OF FACTS

He is to Greg the only reasonable teacher in all of
Schenley

GREG (VO)
Instead I always ate lunch in my
history teachers office
Blue 7

MR MCCARTHY
FACT I will be in 309 for the next
20 minutes Respect the research

McCarthy leaves Greg hits space bar on McCarthy’s DESKTOP to
unpause a YOUTUBE CLIP (from BURDEN OF DREAMS THE MAKING OF
FITZCARRALDO) The boys watch and eat wordlessly

GREG (VO)
with Earl whose role in my life
I’m not even going to try to
explain to you right now

MADISON probably the hottest girl in school and yet somehow
also a fundamentally decent person opens a door

MADISON
Oh hey guys

GREG
Hi Madison

MADISON
Greg how was your summer

She smiles and touches Greg’s arm He suppresses a freak-out

GREG (VO)
One last thing Hot girls destroy
your life That’s just a fact It
doesn’t matter if the hot girl is
also a good person She’s a moose
youre a chipmunk she’s just
wandering through the forest
oblivious and she doesn’t even
know that she stomped your head

GREGS MOM
(entering)
Honey Can we come in

GREG’S PARENTS are in the room now

GREGS MOM is a forceful Jewish mom She believes her son is
the most wonderful person in the world and also that she
must take frequent intrusive measures to redirect his life
She is holding a shrinkwrapped COLLEGE DIRECTORY

Because this is a movie she is probably sort of hot but not
egregiously so

GREG’S DAD holding the family cat is a muumuu-wearing
classics professor a man of profound spacey weirdness He is
often making a face of thoughtful concentration This is to
conceal the unfathomable strangeness within

Why is he thrusting the cat out at Greg What is the cat’s
role in this impromptu family meeting Unclear

GREG
What do you want

GREGS MOM
(tearing shrinkwrap)
First I was going through your
stuff and I saw you haven’t even
opened your college directory So

Princeton Princeton

GREG’S MOM
Well not with that attitude

apartheid and history will not
judge them kindly for it

GREG

Mom She doesn’t want to see me

They size each other up

GREG’S MOM
I’m sorry to be the one to
tell you this Gregory but
you do not have a choice in
this particular matter
because you have been given
the opportunity to make a
very real difference in
someone’s life and if what
youre choosing to do instead
is just lie around the house
all day like a dead slug then
I am required to step in and
inform you that that is one
hundred percent unacceptable
and if you think that any of
these excuses you’re giving
me is more important than the
happiness of a girl with
cancer a friend with cancer
then you have got another
think coming buddy because
you are going to pick up that
phone you are going to call
Rachel you are going to

This pillow is a dude obviously
But he reminds me of a pillow we
used to have Francesca Similar

end we had to give her away That
whole situation was just a
problem

(poker face from Rachel)
But there was also a chemistry
between us that no one could deny

(still nothing ALT

The world thought it was wrong But
maybe the world was wrong Wrong
about what could be between a
pillow and a boy who became a
man

YOUNG GREG AND YOUNG EARL are trying to recreate a scene from
Rashomon Young Greg has a camera and a boom mike Young
Earl dressed like a samurai is sort of spazzing out

be able to get a boner

EARL
Did I say shit about boners No

Now what kinda cancer even is acute

myelogenous leukemia

GREG
You know Cancer of the thing

EXTINT MCCARTHY’S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY

The bell has just rung on the history class of MR MCCARTHY

Mr

Okay Class Tomorrow you must
come armed with an epic fact Just

Respect the research

McCarthy punches his own biceps

MR MCCARTHY
FACTS

Greg approaches him as his classmates file out of the room

GREG
Mr McCarthy Do you know any facts
about uh leukemia

MR MCCARTHY
(kindly)
Yes Leukemia is cancer of the
blood andor bone marrow

GREG
So it’s pretty spread out in the
body

Blue 24

MR MCCARTHY
Own the fact Yes

GREG
How soon do people die from it

MR MCCARTHY
Well it’s often very treatable
bud Why do you ask

GREG
You know Rachel Kushner has
leukemia right

This silences MR MCCARTHY
Also OTHER NEARBY CLASSMATES (including MADISON)
In retrospect Greg has said this way too loud

MADISON
Rachel has what

INT RACHEL’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING 27

GREG is back in RACHEL’S pillow-infested room She is not
happy He has his head in his hands

GREG
I’m like innovatively stupid

RACHEL
Everyone was going to find out
sooner or later I just hate having
to share everything about myself

Greg is trying to think of a way to help

GREG
I’m the exact same way Check it
out One thing you can do when you
don’t want to deal with people is
just enter a subhuman state

Rachel looks at him expressionlessly

GREG (CONT’D)
Here pretend you’re someone
annoying

RACHEL
(impersonating an annoying
classmate)
Hi Rachel I’m really sorry you
have cancer
Blue 25

GREG
(cross-eyed sort of
zombie-like)
urrrrjj jjjunhjh uuhjjghjnj
gnngnngh

Rachel does not know what to think of this It’s definitely
cute It’s also deeply stupid

RACHEL
Does that ever work

GREG
It works all the time It’s passive
resistance That’s what Gandhi was
all about

RACHEL
I’m pretty sure Gandhi never did
the subhuman thing

GREG
How do you think India achieved
statehood Try it uurrrnng
mnnurrrrjjrjjjj-

RACHEL
(smiling)
Nope

GREG
Come on It’s easy Or another
thing you can do is just flat-out
pretend to be dead Check it out
Say something annoying to me

RACHEL
(impersonating another
annoying classmate)
Hi Rachel I just wanted you to
remember that your cancer is all
part of God’s plan

Greg is being flamboyantly dead Rachel is enjoying this But
behind her head a cut-out of HUGH JACKMAN glares at Greg

HUGH JACKMAN
Yo Asshole Just so we’re straight
on this You’re advising a girl
with cancer to pretend to be dead

GREG
(nervously trying to
ignore Hugh Jackman)
urrngh
Blue 26

HUGH JACKMAN
No seriously Think about what
youre doing here dickhead Jesus

Greg is now lying there with a horrified look on his face

HUGH JACKMAN (CONTD)
I’ve been doing my broody Wolverine
face on this girl’s wall for five
and a quarter years and at this
point I’m probably only still here
because she’d feel weirdly guilty
or disloyal taking me down but I’m
goddamned if I’m letting a little
punk like you waltz in here
stupiding up the place--

RACHEL
Greg what’s wrong
GREG
Uh
(foolishly)

Sorry I shouldn’t have told you to
pretend to be dead It was really
insensitive

RACHEL
I mean I’m sick I’m not dying

GREG
(panicking)
No yeah obviously but now I’m being
all weird about it and I can’t get
un-weird because I’m just an idiot
and despite what you just said I’m
clearly still sitting here thinking
“death death death death death”--

Suddenly Rachel enters a subhuman state

RACHEL
huuurnnrnnnrnnh hurrnrnnrngghjh

Greg processes this
For the first time in his life a girl has understood him
GREG

THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I AM TALKING
ABOUT
Blue GREG (VO)
So if this was a touching romantic
story this is probably where a new
feeling would wash over me and our
eyes would meet and suddenly we
would be furiously making out with
the fire of a thousand suns

26A
Green 27

Rachel stops the subhuman state Their eyes meet There is no
makeout session

GREG RACHEL
Anyway Yup
GREG (VO)
But this isn’t a touching romantic
story

But we did still become friends

Super The part where Rachel and I become actual friends
aka THE POINT OF NO RETURN

You’re too good of a listener When
we hang out I do an insane amount
of talking

27A
Blue 28

RACHEL
(giggling)
You just have a lot more to say
than I do

GREG
It’s quantity versus quality The
stuff I have to say is idiotic
Have you not picked up on that I
guess actually you’re a terrible
listener Anyway you talk now

RACHEL
“T talk now”

GREG
Like about stuff that you’re
like going through these days

RACHEL
Oh You mean talk about cancer

GREG
Only if you want to

He really wants to be a good friend and listener He just has
no idea how Rachel takes pity on him

RACHEL
I can give you 5 minutes of cancer

END MONTAGE

31lptl EXT STREETS OF RACHEL’S NEIGHBORHOOD - A FEW MINUTES LADRR1

RACHEL

The hardest part is watching my mom
try to deal with it And sometimes
I mean I do think if it ends up
that she’s alone in that house
She has no one She and my dad hate
each other she has no siblings
I don’t know what she’d do

Rachel is somber but dry-eyed

GREG
Uh Don’t cry

RACHEL
I’m not crying
Blue 29

GREG
Right
(beat)
You can cry if you need to

RACHEL
I thought you just said don’t cry

GREG
Uhhh

RACHEL
(rescuing Greg)
My dad and I used to walk around
the block and count squirrels

GREG
(genuinely confused)
Did he work for like the squirrel
census

RACHEL
No It was just the thing we did
when it was time for us to spend
time together We didn’t even talk
while we were doing it The only
words we said were like

“squirrel Seven two squirrels
Nine”
GREG
You need to apply for a dad refund

RACHEL and GREG’s conversation continues in the aisles of a
cluttered venerable old comicsrecordsmovies store--

RACHEL
So what group am I in
Blue GREG

RACHEL
Yesterday you were saying you’ve
mapped out the entire high school
by group So what’s my group

GREG
Seriously

Boring Jewish Senior Girls Subgroup

RACHEL
(disgusted)
Ugh

GREG
Please appreciate how honest that
was just now

RACHEL
You’re an asshole What group are
you in

GREG
I’m not I wouldn’t belong in any
group that doesn’t suck I’m
terminally awkward and I have a
face like a groundhog

RACHEL
You can’t really think that

GREG
I don’t think that I know that
For a kid like me best-case for
high school is just survive
That’s all you can hope for
Survive without creating a mortal
enemy or hideously embarrassing
yourself forever

RACHEL
Just survive until college huh

GREG
College College is going to be
even worse

RACHEL
What

Blue 31

GREG
At least high school is over at
three And it’s kids I know by now
College is nonstop strangers Some
of them live in your room You can
literally never relax I see myself
dying of a panic attack two weeks
in I might just not apply

RACHEL
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever
heard you say

GREG

It’s probably not even top five
Look High school college we’re
forced to spend these years of our
lives in giant herds of randomly
selected people we have nothing in
common with It’s a nightmare
Anyone who says otherwise is lying

Rachel gazes at this weird kid with the self-esteem deficit

RACHEL

(decisively)
Congratulations Greg Tomorrow
youre eating lunch with Boring
Jewish Senior Girls Subgroup 2a

GREG
Maybe you’re not such a good
listener

INT CAFETERIA - THE NEXT DAY 32

Now RACHEL and GREG are wading through the HORRIFYING CHAOS
that is the Schenley cafeteria

RACHEL
So where do you usually sit

ROBO-GREG’S POV Greg’s system is going haywire His field of
vision is disastrously cluttered with LABELS and DATA

The giant red words “SYSTEM FAILURE” are flashing over
everything and making that BURMP BURMP BURMP sound that means
that a computer is about to explode

BACK TO THE THIRD-PERSON
GREG

It’s literally like we’re trying to
have lunch in Kandahar
Blue 31A

They sit at a table with ANNA and NAOMI two of Rachel’s
NONDESCRIPT-LOOKING FRIENDS

ANNA
Rachel we just found out the theme
of this year’s prom It’s “A Knight
To Remember”
Blue 32

NAOMI
Knight with a “K”

ANNA
Medieval prom-m-m-m

GREG
Isn’t prom like six months away

They turn their gaze to Greg Who is this schmuck who’s gonna
talk trash on medieval prom

RACHEL
Hi guys Greg’s sitting with us
today Anyone need ketchup No

Rachel goes to get ketchup leaving Greg to fend for himself

GREG
Hello

NAOMI
(fake-nice)
So Greg why are you sitting with
us today

GREG
Uh you know Lunch Gotta sit
somewhere You can’t stand and eat

NAOMI
You and Rachel seem very
friendly all of a sudden

Naomi is patiently cleverly devising some sort of rhetorical
trap Anna does not share this patience or cleverness

ANNA
Yeah You’re only hanging out with
Rachel because she has cancer

GREG
What

NAOMI
Greg you’ve never hung out with
Rachel once You’re befriending her
to feel good about yourself It’s
okay You can admit it

GREG
No I’m not Who even does that

Enter MADISON HARTNER She touches Greg’s arm

A MOOSE STOMPS A CHIPMUNK
Blue 33

MADISON
Hi guys Can I sit with you

Anna and Naomi gaze at her with coolness if not hostility

But RACHEL has re-arrived with her ketchup so they can’t be
mean to her outright

RACHEL
Of course

Greg is relieved that someone else has shown up who is more
of an irritating do-gooder than him

Madison puts a PILLOW on the table

MADISON
Sorry I have to carry this pillow
around and pretend it’s a baby For
health class This is a safe place
to put it right

RACHEL
(playfully)
A pillow Greg what do you think

GREG
(trying to play along)
Yeah you better not put it too
close to me because I might uh
just masturbate all over it

No one understands this inside joke except Greg and Rachel
A horrified silence settles over the table

ANNA
GREG THAT’S WEIRD AND GROSS

Greg panics He needs to change the subject He sees SCOTT
MAYHEW loping clumsily around his TRENCH COAT flapping

GREG
Um Everyone Check out Scott
Mayhew’s tyrannosaurus walk Great
way to get from point A to point B
I think we should all try it

Success Rachel giggles Emboldened Greg continues
GREG (CONT’D)
Also love the trench coat indoors

Climate change You never know

Scattered giggling This is actually working Greg goes in
for the kill

Blue 34

GREG (CONT’D)
And will someone please tell me
what is up with this guy’s hair It
looks like an orc’s pubes

No one laughs Oh Jesus

MADISON
Greg that’s really mean

RACHEL
I think he heard you

He did He is staring at Greg coldly Their gazes meet

Greg grabs his stuff and flees

This is clearly a question about Rachel Greg does not know
how to fight the implication that he and Rachel have a thing

GREG
Holding up Good But not great
But I mean stuff in general ups
and downs take it as it comes
Life has many facets So amen

MR MCCARTHY
Amen You owe me multiple essays
And that is a fact Gentlemen

assault a fake baby Then I became
mortal enemies with Scott Mayhew
Both of those are Rachel’s fault
I’m sorry They just are

GREG (CONTD)
(rebelliously)
But somehow I’m the dick for
complaining about it
Earl doubles down on his disgusted stare
GREG (CONTD)

I mean I am a dick for complaining
about it I didn’t actually mean
any of that

Better play with them titties

GREG
Does this taste strange to you

CUT TO

INT MATH CLASS - LATER THAT DAY 34

GREG is sitting in class Something is wrong with him He is
staring dully forward a look of muted horror on his face

Slow agonizing ZOOM on his face scored to the eerie
melancholy descending chords of movement XIII “Crucifixus”
of the Mass in B Minor by JS Bach

SPLICE with Greg’s POV of the TEACHER droning distantly and
unintelligibly as if underwater

GREG’S CLASSMATES all seem to be staring at him
A cartoon badger image flickers over his field of vision

The BUZZ OF HIS VIBRATING PHONE frightens the LIVING SHIT OUT
OF HIM

Greg looks at his phone Earl has texted him a message that
soup had drugs Greg looks up at the teacher in horror

SUPER The part where I accidentally am on drugs

The bell rings Greg jumps to his feet Then immediately he
falls down

Blue 37
INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 35

Greg is in a crowded hallway attempting to make his way out
of school His eyes are wild and his movements clumsy

SPLICE with his ROBO-GREG POV which is distorted and
malfunctioning The badger image continues to blip over his
field of vision Sometimes the badger has tentacles

INT CITY BUS ON THE WAY HOME - TEN MINUTES LATER 37

GREG is still wild-eyed glancing around suspiciously and
trying to be less conspicuous by slouching in his seat This
behavior is extremely conspicuous

EARL tries to distract him--

EARL
In class do McCarthy act all stoned
and shit

GREG
Uh I guess he uh Not all the
time but like sometimes or not
sometimes but You know how he
is he’s uh Huh

EARL
Goddamn son You can’t even put a
goddamn sentence together

GREG
It’s insane that Mr McCarthy eats
soup with drugs in it

EARL
Keep your damn voice down

Indeed Sitting behind them is SCOTT MAYHEW

He has heard everything
Blue 38 EXT RACHEL’S DOORSTEP
Greg and Earl are standing on the doorstep
GREG

We can’t tell anyone we’re on

EARL
Why the hell not

Beat

GREG
Because then they’1ll know

Denise opens the door swaying a little -

It’s my humble little mouse And

who is his little mouse friend

Neither Greg nor Earl says anything Then they both say
something at the same time

DENISE (CONTD)
Sorry

confrontational)
Earl Jackson

GREG
Earl’s just uh you know he’s my
coworker and he’s a great guy and
we were just hanging out uhhh
and not really doing anything and
Rachel’s about to lose all her
hair so we just wanted to say hey
you know what’s up Goodbye hair
Good riddance Because she is gonna
look great without hair That’s a
fact So we just wanted to say
what’s up

But Denise isn’t sober enough to realize they’re being weird

Hello Earl

EARL
Hi Rachel I like your room
RACHEL
Thank you Greg thinks it’s too

GREG

No This room is great What are

EARL
Course it’s girly It’s a girl’s

But if it did that’d be weird
Blue 41

An uneasy silence

EARL
So Rachel We came to check up on
you

RACHEL
Thanks

GREG
Yeah chemotherapy That really
sucks

EARL

(shoving Greg)
Dude Don’t say it sucks

RACHEL
It does kind of suck

EARL
Yeah but you gotta do it so

RACHEL
I guess

By this point Rachel and Earl are both staring at the ground
Clearly Greg has to say something

GREG
Uhhhhh

Earl and Rachel look at him expectantly Greg literally
cannot think of a thing to say He opens his mouth and hopes
words will come out

GREG (CONTD)
Buhhhhhh

RACHEL
(beginning to sound
tearful)
You guys can go if you want

Greg panics

GREG
We’re on drugs

EARL
(face in hands again)
Goddamn
RACHEL

Why are you on drugs
Blue 42

GREG
Were accidentally on drugs

RACHEL
Accidentally

EARL
McCarthy gave us some of his soup--

GREG

(hastily)
Mr McCarthy gave us some of his
totally normal soup But it was
uh the last of the soup So we had
to go get more From a restaurant
On the fifth floor of an office
building And in the same building
there was a Jamaican embassy

No one knows where this is going

GREG (CONT’D)
We got trapped in an elevator with
a Rastafarian He just hotboxed the
whole elevator We were in there
for 25 minutes We had to breathe
the weird marijuana air Earl Am I
right

Earl is utterly disgusted But he has to go along with it

EARL
Yeah That’s what happened

But thank God Rachel thinks that these confused lying boys
are being kind of sweet

RACHEL

You guys had quite an adventure
GREG

Being on drugs sucks and then

being around someone on drugs
sucks this whole situation sucks
super bad and it’s all my fault--

I’m in the mood for some damn ice
cream You like ice cream
Blue 43
EXTINT TABLE OUTSIDE ICE-CREAM PLACE 40

EARL and RACHEL are chatting GREG is utterly absorbed in his
ice cream holding it several inches in front of his face

Super The part where it turns out Earl holds nothing sacred

RACHEL
So you know Greg from class

EARL
I known Greg ever since we was
little You know I was in y’all’s
kindergarten right

RACHEL
Really

EARL

Yeah I remember you You were the
girl who called Justin Jones
perverted for showing girls the
birthmark on his butt

Said “Justin Only perverts show
their butts” I was right there

RACHEL

EARL
You was a hero Shut his perverted
ass right down Never forget it

RACHEL
So you and Greg are coworkers

EARL

EARL
Man I don’t even know Might be
his folks Dude’s mom always tellin

EARL (CONTD)
So he think he can’t trust nobody
who’s close to him Dude’s weird-
ass dad don’t socialize with nobody
cept the cat So that’s a role
model ain’t got no friends

Bottom line dude’s terrified to
call anybody his friend Because
they might say hold up bro I
ain’t your friend And then he’d
have to kill himself

RACHEL
Wow
(beat)
But how are you “coworkers”

Earl regards her and silently comes to a decision

EARL

Well we uh we make films
RACHEL

Movies
EARL

We made like 42 films in total

RACHEL
Greg you never told me

GREGS POV

Rachel’s voice is indistinct underwater He cannot hear much
over the “MURMF ORMF RUMF” sound of his own rapturous eating

Also the beautiful harp music is playing
BACK TO THIRD-PERSON
Greg nods briskly goes “mm-hmm” and goes back to eating
EARL
We ain’t told nobody about em They

RACHEL
There’s no way they suck

Again Earl appraises Rachel before speaking

(knowing that this is a
big deal)
Are you sure

Blue They sit there in silence Earl serene Greg fuming GREG’S
DAD appears behind them and mutely hands each of them a pig’s

foot to eat

GREG (VO)
So we’re pretty far into this
stupid story now and you’re
probably saying to yourself “Hey
I like this girl Rachel and I’m
gonna be pissed if she dies at the
end” So I’m just telling you
Don’t freak out She survives When
I said someone dies I meant
someone else

So hopefully that reassures you

Although actually why would it

INT MCCARTHY’S CLASSROOM - A FEW DAYS LATER
MR MCCARTHY sips from his thermos

MR MCCARTHY
Guys I’m asking for one fact This
is probably the easiest thing you
have been asked all day Anyone No
one has a fact Great I’1l just
call on you at random Scott

Scott Mayhew is not psyched about being called on
Fortunately he has a focal point for his irritation

SCOTT MAYHEW
Fact Greg was telling everyone
that your soup has marijuana in it

The class now is stunnedgiggly

GREG
I didn’t tell anyone

SCOTT MAYHEW
Greg you are a liar and a coward
I heard you bellowing about it on
public transit

MR MCCARTHY
Greg Is that factual

GREG
(defensively)
Look I’m sorry But yesterday
Earl and I got stoned somehow And
it was after we both ate your soup
(MORE )

Blue 47
GREG (CONTD)
And we didn’t smoke any marijuana
which I never have done So your
soup must have had drugs in it
Because that was the only thing we
both ate other than the cookies
that Earl got from Ill Phil the
uh drug dealer Aha

44 EXT IN FRONT OF THE SCHOOL - THAT AFTERNOON 44

GREG and EARL are exiting the school together

GREG
How did you not realize it was the
cookies

EARL

It was your stupid ass yellin shit
on the bus

But behind them the PRINCIPAL and a SECURITY GUARD burst
through the door escorting an angry struggling ILL PHIL off
the premises

ILL PHIL
Greg Did you snitch on me

GREG
What No of course not

SCOTT MAYHEW has positioned himself nearby

SCOTT MAYHEW
(to Ill Phil)
He did snitch on you I was there

GREG
Scott what the hell

Scott draws close to Greg He is a lot taller than Greg

SCOTT MAYHEW
I heard you ridiculing me in front
of your loathsome harem
(whispering intensely)
Greg I trusted you You betrayed
my trust You trampled my dignity

GREG
It was like one time

SCOTT MAYHEW
You have made a mortal enemy I
will never stop hounding you

Blue 48

ILL PHIL
You got two mortal enemies
(whispering into Greg’s
other ear)
I stabbed a dude

GREG
Jesus

ILL PHIL
(breaking determinedly
into a flow)

Kill you twenty different ways
Stab you with blades
Shoot you with death rays
Abandon you in a maze
Choke you on mayonnaise

The security guard drags him away
Greg and Earl turn to Scott Mayhew

SCOTT MAYHEW
He too will never stop hounding
you

Scott Mayhew spits on the ground near them and strides away

EXTINT RACHEL’S HOUSEBEDROOM - AFTER FIRST ROUND OF CHEMO

GREG is visiting RACHEL and trying not to freak out about
how bad she looks She is wearing a fuzzy pink hat Her eyes

Super The part where I hit on a girl who just had chemo

GREG
-so it’s been a month and they
haven’t really done anything but

later yknow gonna get hounded

RACHEL

She looks at him Then she erupts miserably--

RACHEL

Look I was never very beautiful
And that was fine because that’s
not important to me But I thought
itd be easier--to look like this
and it’s just not Everyone comes
in here and sees me--and they’re so
clearly repulsed--and it’s so much
harder than I thought it would be--

GREG
No Come on You look good

RACHEL
I look ugly I’m so ugly Greg
(gathering herself)
I just feel very naked I feel like
my body’s on display like some
terrible exhibit Girl With Cancer
(thoughtfully)
It’s your worst nightmare actually
being exposed like this--

Something shuts her up She stares at Greg
He is nervously fondling her boob

She closes her eyes and for a moment he thinks it is because
she is enjoying it

But she is not

RACHEL (CONT’D)
Greg no

GREG
I’m not doing this because it might
be your last chance to be with a
man I’m doing this because I can’t
control myself

Greg decides that now is the time for excessive modesty

GREG
I’m not that good of a friend

MADISON
No really Greg You’re being a

INT HOSPITAL LOUNGE - SECOND ROUND OF TREATMENT - EARLY 52
DECEMBER — DAY

GREG holding the ENORMOUS COLLEGE DIRECTORY under one arm
finds RACHEL in the hospital’s cheery modern lounge She is
watching one of his movies on her laptop

She pauses it as she approaches

RACHEL

(happily)
“Droogle”

GREG
Google for droogs It’s stupid

Greg is in a foul mood

RACHEL
(indicating directory)
What’s that

GREG
Oh nothing Just the bane of my
existence Which my mom is forcing
me to carry around Until I apply
to some colleges She says it’s
like a menu for my future Sure A
menu that only has food that will
humiliate you for four years So
it’s kind of a Mexican standoff in
which I carry this thing around
forever until my mom has irritated
me to death Which will happen in
tops two days

Beat

RACHEL
You have to be less of an idiot
about college Listen Even if you
don’t think your classmates will
like you which is literally an
insane thing to think you’re way
less exposed to them in college
High school is 40 hours of class a
week College is 15-20
And if you don’t want to live with
other kids go to school around
here Go to Pittsburgh State Live
at home Don’t get me wrong I
think living at home would be
unnecessary and stupid But it’s
better than sitting college out
just because you irrationally hate
yourself
Blue 58-59

GREG
(cowed)
Not “irrationally” though--

RACHEL
Just apply to Pitt State right now
Apply early
(she nods at her computer)
Do it right now in front of me
Let’s get this out of the way

GREG
What if I say no
RACHEL
Ive got stage four cancer

So that would be pretty dick

GREG
UGGH FINE

They sit down He melodramatically takes her computer and
begins typing

GREG (CONT’D)
“Why I want to go to college”
(defiantly to Rachel)
By Werner Herzog

Rachel shrugs bring it on

GREG (CONT’D)

(Werner Herzog voice)
The highly selective admissions
process of college weeds out the
cruel and the stupid And so a
college is quite different from the
senseless chaos and sickening
enormity of high school High
school is the mouth of a great
demon biting and chewing and
smushing people in the face It is
simply overwhelming

(dropping the Herzog

voice)
In seriousness I am looking
forward to college because I never
fit in in high school Because of
my weird rodent face -

RACHEL
Nope -
Beat

Blue GREG
And habit of saying the dumbest
possible shit -

RACHEL
No

GREG
The sheer pastiness of my
complexion overwhelms all who
behold it with existential nausea -

RACHEL

(overriding him)
“In high school I never truly got
comfortable in my own skin In
fact I’ve always been someone who
doesn’t like himself very much But
I think that just means I have some
growing up to do And college is
the place where I’m going to do
it”

GREG
(deeply uncomfortable)
That’s way too personal

RACHEL
It’s a personal essay

GREG

Fine But only because cancer

(briskly typing)
And you have to do this too now
Okay Here Page through this huge
horrible book It’s yours now Find
some colleges Mmmmmmmmmm It’s
like a menu for your future

protect her from that I have

reflecting some tiny part of the crushing horror of it

So did she have a favorite toy

Promise me one thing You’re gonna
grow up become an adult Promise
me you won’t have a baby unless
youre ready to love that baby’s

Earl advances down the steps of his porch on an increasingly
trembly weepy Greg

GREG

don’t know if I can work with with
you again--

Earl socks Greg in the stomach Greg immediately keels over

DERRICK

Blue 78

But Earl does not jack that little dude up He storms back
inside his house furious

Wheezing and choking back sobs Greg gets to his feet He
looks at the house Derrick gazes coolly back at him

DERRICK (CONT’D)

INT MCCARTHY’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY 72

GREG is sullenly eating alone MR MCCARTHY walks in to
refill his thermos

MR MCCARTHY
Beast Where’s the other beast

GREG
Earl I don’t know He’s not here

Mr McCarthy gamely tries again

MR MCCARTHY
What’s the status with the twenty-
pager on Nixon

GREG
I need another extension

MR MCCARTHY
It’s the end of the quarter bud

GREG
Well I’ve been busy

Mr McCarthy observes Greg

MR MCCARTHY
(more quietly)
I heard the latest about Rachel
(beat)
How are you holding up

GREG
You know not great

MR MCCARTHY
I was fifteen when my Dad died
Couple years younger than you

Greg is startled by this
Blue MR MCCARTHY (CONTD)
You know what I remember about it
My whole childhood I just thought
of him as this big quiet kind of
asshole guy Didn’t laugh much
Liked his sons to wear ties

And then at the wake all his old
buddies are there telling me about
him and it’s like they’re talking
about a complete other guy Like
he knew every European pop song
from the 70s from when he was
stationed in Germany He’d just sit
around memorizing songs to sing at
German girls in bars His go-to was
this Dutch song called Ding-A-Dong
That’s a real song And he sang it
at German girls in bars

GREG
So what does that mean

MR MCCARTHY
It just means that even if someone
dies you’re still gonna keep
learning about them You know
Their life keeps unfolding to you
if you keep paying attention to it

GREG
(sullenly)
What if you’re like a historian
Are you seriously trying to make
this into some stupid sappy lesson

Mr McCarthy smiles at Greg and gets to his feet

MR MCCARTHY
You’re a good kid Greg

GREG
I’m not

MR MCCARTHY
You’re a good goddamn kid

GREG
(gathering his stuff)
Look I’m going home I’m cutting
school right in front of you I’m
not a good kid

Mr McCarthy says nothing

GREG (CONT’D)
(leaving)
I’m not

INT CITY BUS - A FEW MINUTES LATER A73

GREG is slumped in a seat staring without seeing out of the
window as the bus rumbles home

INT GREG’S KITCHEN - A HALF-HOUR LATER 73
On his way in GREG passes his DAD munching sausage

GREG’S DAD
Earl came by earlier to drop
something off but he turned down
this superb Andouille rabbit
sausage which is quite unlike him -
is everything all right

Greg does not respond

INT GREG’S BEDROOM 74

GREG finds a DVD on his desk On it is scrawled in Sharpie
“IM OUT”

He plays the DVD It’s of EARL talking to the camera in
Greg’s room

EARL
Hi Rachel We tried a bunch of
different ways of making a film for
you and all of em turned out
goofy and irrelevant and not like
we wanted So now I’m just gonna
talk to you directly

(collects himself)
I’ma be honest here Sometimes
white girls are a particular kind
of stupid I mean errbody stupid
but you know White girls think
they smarter than errbody Self-
centered and pretendin like they
ain’t - well obviously you ain’t
been like that
(collects himself again)

It’s just crazy how patient you
been That’s all I wanted to say
If it was me at had cancer I’d be
angry as hell and and hurtful
and just tryna beat errybody’s ass
half the time

(MORE )
Blue EARL (CONTD)

So I’m just amazed at how patient
you been And you’ve made me feel
uh blessed

(now pissed off also a

little husky-voiced)

Greg I ain’t workin on this no
more Do whatever the hell you
want I’m out

80A

Blue 81

Earl switches off the camera and the clip ends leaving Greg
alone in his room

Greg holds his head in his hands

Then he flips on the camera And tries to do a testimonial of
his own

GREG
Hi Rachel Uh Earl’s right All
the ways we tried to make a film
for you turned out completely
horrible So yeah It got me
thinking about the reason I wanted
to do this film

He pauses The fact is he never wanted to do this film

GREG (CONT’D)
And that reason is when you come
right down to it and just say it
simply without screwing around

He has to say something

GREG (CONT’D)
Uh I believe in you

He is quoting the first video testimonial from that stupid
kid He’s not even saying his own meaningless clichéd thing
It’s something else’s

He can’t bring himself to look at the camera He’s looking
down at his hands

GREG (CONTD)
(finally sadly)
You can do it

He is silent Then he shuts off the camera

INT MCCARTHY’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY 75

GREG opens the door to Mr McCarthy’s office EARL is in
there eating one of his all-candy lunches On a screen
behind him plays MY BEST FIEND KLAUS KINSKI

GREG
Oh Are you eating lunch in here
still

EARL

Not if you are

Blue 82

GREG
Well I’m not eating in here if you
are
EARL
Well good Cuz I like it in here
GREG

could go
EARL

Nope I like the air-conditioning
and I like the comfortable chairs

GREG
Yeah I like those too

EARL
Well that’s your damn problem
INT CAFETERIA - SHORTLY AFTERWARDS 76

GREG trudges sadly through his personal hell the cafeteria
One flying bit of food hits his face then another

He finds a place to sit alone Over his head a banner reads
SCHENLEY SENIOR PROM “2013” A “KNIGHT” TO “REMEMBER” 1
INT CAFETERIA - DAYS PASS 77

He eats alone in the same seat day after day forlorn and
withdrawn

He is checking his email on his phone despondently -

(we can’t read the body but it’s from Pittsburgh State
University)

- when someone sits down in front of him
It is MADISON
Arm touchMOOSE SMUSHES CHIPMUNK WITH HOOVES
MADISON
Greg I need to talk to you about

the movie

GREG
It’s not done yet
Blue MADISON
Greg You’ve been working on this
movie for like four months

GREG
Yeah we tried a bunch of things
They just aren’t very good

82A

Blue MADISON
UGH Greg Now is not the time for
your whole I’m-Greg I-suck
nothing-I-do-is-any-good thing I’m
sure what you have is awesome and
Greg I really think it can make a
difference if you just put it
together and give it to her

GREG
(bitterly)
Madison she’s stopped treatment
She gave up She quit

Madison gazes at him Her eyes glisten

MADISON
(icily)
So maybe that’s a good reason to
finish the stupid movie And give
it to her
(more so)
But you know what Whatever

She stalks away

INT GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

GREG is watching his testimonial to Rachel He watches

himself mumble “I believe in you” Pathetic He rewinds it

and plays it again “You can do it” Excruciating

His MOM enters the room

GREGS MOM
Honey

GREG
What

He looks up His mother looks stricken

GREGS MOM
Honey Rachel’s back in the
hospital

GREG

Wait--is she starting treatment
again
Blue GREGS MOM
It’s not for treatment honey

GREG
Oh

His mom waits for him to say something

GREG (CONT’D)
Mom what

GREG’S MOM
I just thought we could go--

GREG
You just figured this was your last
chance to force me to hang out with
her

GREGS MOM
Greg come on--

GREG
Don’t worry mom I’m sure you can
find some other girl with cancer
after Rachel dies Which by the
way she’s decided to do Shes
decided to die So maybe I can
decide not to visit her

GREGS MOM
I promise you will regret it if you
don’t visit her You will regret it
for the rest of your life

GREG

(exploding)
Yeah That’s probably true But you
know what I have a shitload of
things to regret I regret not
having a date for tomorrow’s stupid
prom I regret being too weird to
make friends I definitely regret
making those shitty films with
Earl And I assume you saw the
email I got today from Pitt State
when you were going through my
stuff - no You didn’t Oh Have a
look

He opens an email on his phone and tosses it to his mom
GREG (CONT’D)

I’m probably gonna regret doing
literally no schoolwork this year

Blue GREGS MOM
(in shock)
Oh my God Greg--

GREG
I know Admission rescinded Due to
“significant change in my academic
record” Oh well No college I
guess I’ll just be home next year
I know it sucks It’1ll be way
harder for you to go through my
stuff

His mom horrified says nothing

GREG (CONTD)
But for right now do me a favor
And just leave me alone I just
want to sit here and regret stuff
I’m gonna think of everything I’ve
ever done and everything I haven’t
done and just regret the living
shit out of it

EXTINT GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

GREG is watching his animation and his sock puppets and
listening to HIS PARENTS argue through the walls

GREG’S MOM (0S)
(tearfully)
The deadlines have passed Victor
What’s he going to do next year Is
he just going to waste his year

GREG’S DAD (0S)
He is grieving honey You have to
let him grieve

GREG’S MOM (0S)
How can you tell me to just do
nothing while he ruins his life

GREGS DAD (0S)
That’s not what I’m saying

The conversation continues as Greg watches his video
SOCK PUPPET RACHEL

I BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF CANCER
BECAUSE I DON’T GIVE A SHIT

Blue 85A
EXT SCHENLEYINT CAFETERIA - THE NEXT DAY 80

Once again GREG is eating alone under the prom banner which

more gratuitous quotation marks
Blue And again Madison comes to sit with him
Super The part where I get in my second fight ever

MADISON
(hesitantly)
Greg Can I ask you something

Greg gathers his things and gets up

GREG
Nope

MADISON
It’s not what you think--
ALT It’s not what you think It’s
about prom--

Madison touches his arm but he shrugs it off angrily--

GREG
(interrupting)
Let me ask you something--what is
this What is up with the arm-
touching

Greg is backing away from her now She is following

GREG (CONT’D)
Are you just being friendly Or is
it like this calculated tactic
To get me to do whatever you want
Because you have to understand what
it does when a beautiful sexy
otherwise thoughtful girl touches
the arm of a scrawny pasty guy with
a groundhog face It’s an act of
cruelty

MADISON
Are you done

GREG
Yeah I’m done with you And Im
done with the stupid film
He backs into ILL PHIL

ILL PHIL
But you ain’t done with me

GREG
Oh come on
Blue ILL PHIL
Youll never escape me Nobody rats
me out and lives to tell about it

(MORE )

86A
Blue 87
ILL PHIL (CONTD)
I’m back for my revenge
Stab you in the dick pardon my
French
Shove your body under a bench

GREG
(frantic)
Are you honestly gonna stab me
Fine Go for it You’re gonna go to
jail for your entire life but
it’s probably worth it Stab away

Ill Phil is not prepared for this He was hoping Greg’s
reaction would be more along the lines of running away

ILL PHIL
You lucky I ain’t got my knives
Stead you gotta fight me punk

GREG
Sure Ill fight you Just no
rapping

They square up Onlookers excitedly gather including a
grimly snickering SCOTT MAYHEW

Neither Greg nor Phil makes a move for a long time

They actually have no idea how to fight

ILL PHIL GREG (CONTD)
(muttering rap)
Break your eyeball with a Stop
fist I got clenched
Take your teeth out with a Seriously stop
wrench
Hit you with a stone from I can’t do this if you’re
Stonehenge gonna rap the whole time

Finally Ill Phil swings and Greg grabs his arm But then Greg
doesn’t know what to do with it

ILL PHIL (CONT’D)
(thrashing a little)
Leggo my arm

GREG
Okay Jesus

SCOTT MAYHEW
Phil Remember how he has trampled
our dignity

More circling The onlookers are becoming restless Finally
Greg rushes Ill Phil and grabs him around the waist I1l1 Phil
panics and grabs Greg around his waist

Blue 88

They stay like that for a while

And then suddenly EARL flies in and starts whooping ILL
PHIL’S ass

The CROWD goes berserk

Almost immediately the PRINCIPAL separates the fight

PRINCIPAL
BREAK IT UP

INT SCHENLEY HALLWAY 81

The PRINCIPAL and a SECURITY GUARD are leadingdragging EARL

GREG

Even Earl does not know what to say here

MADISON (CONTD)
Look You were right This whole
movie situation has been really
difficult for you and I feel like
it’s my fault I want a chance to
make things up to you a little bit

ILL PHIL
Yo you can make things up to me

You want my number

EARL
(to Ill Phil)
Ain’t nobody want your beat-ass

GREG
So this is a pity date

MADISON

She smiles
MADISON (CONTD)
I think we’d have fun
INT GREG’S BEDROOM - THAT EVENING 83

GREG is putting on his tuxedo He is having some trouble with
the arms

His MOM is standing by the door

GREGS MOM

I told you you would get a date
GREG

Yup
GREGS MOM

So you’re welcome For the tuxedo
and everything

GREG
Thanks Mom

Green 90

GREGS MOM
I am very unhappy about this
college thing But your father and
I can wait until you’re ready to
talk about it

GREG
I appreciate that

GREGS MOM
Let me help with your corsage

She does
Greg examines himself in the mirror
GREG’S MOM (CONT’D)
My handsome boy going to prom
Take lots of pictures okay
Greg does not answer He’s busy looking into the mirror An
anxious boy in a tuxedo stares back out at him

EXT IN FRONT OF GREG’S HOUSE - EVENING 84

GREG holding corsage walks stiffly into a limousine

INT LIMOUSINE 85

GREG is alone in the back of a cavernous limousine He has to
shout to reach his cheerful DRIVER

GREG
302 Halket Street

LIMO DRIVER
You got it boss

They drive

LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
You love this girl

GREG
Uh I dunno if I would go that far

LIMO DRIVER
Are you kids gonna get busy on my
brand-new Tuscan leather

GREG
I think the odds are against that

Green 91

LIMO DRIVER
Ha I’m just playing with you man
I hope you do get some

GREG
Thanks It’s really gonna depend on
what she wants to do

LIMO DRIVER
Well If you really love her you
got a shot Because she’1l know

Greg does not respond to this

LIMO DRIVER (CONT’D)
She is fine though

GREG
I wouldn’t say that

EXT SIDEWALK - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER 86
GREG exits the limo holding his corsage

He is not in front of Madison’s house He is front of the
HOSPITAL

He takes a deep breath

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - MAY - EVENING 87
RACHEL is suffering from pneumonia a complication of end-
stage AML She is extremely pale and having difficulty
focussing But she smiles when GREG walks in

SUPER Day 209 of Doomed Friendship

DENISE sitting next to her smiles with wet eyes gets up
and hugs Greg for a very long time Then she leaves the room

GREG
Hey

RACHEL
Hey

Her voice is weak and whispery
GREG
I know I look amazing Here let

me put flowers on you

RACHEL
Thanks

Blue 92

He puts the corsage on her wrist It is not romantic It is
something else

He extracts his phone and a little projector from his pocket
and starts setting them up -

GREG
Before we watch this uh I’m
really sorry it took so long to
make But the reason for that is
we couldn’t figure out how to not
get it to suck And we never did
figure it out It still sucks and
it’s not actually what I wanted to
say to you But let’s just watch it
first Okay

She nods

He turns on the projector It projects onto the curtain He
sits next to her and they watch for a while

The film does as advertised suck

First there are the TESTIMONIALS students sitting in a
classroom saying clichéd things or unhelpful things So
those suck

DENISE’S INTERVIEW has been jarringly edited so as not to be
depressing but of course this makes it even more depressing
It goes without saying that this sucks

And spliced among all of these sections is a mysterious
ANIMATION that is never explained and never gets enough time
to develop It’s confusing How could that not suck

As they watch Rachel begins to cough weakly Greg ignores
this for a few coughs

Then he realizes that it isn’t going away

GREG (CONT’D)
Should I get a nurse

Rachel nods coughing in pain

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY 88
SLIGHTLY SLOWED DOWN SOUND MUFFLED
GREG emerges from the room DENISE is asleep in a chair

outside He jogs her arm She wakes up reads his face and
rushes into the room stricken

Blue 93

GREG (VO)
That was the last time I saw
Rachel She went into a coma
shortly after that and died about
ten hours later

Greg flags down a passing NURSE and says something to her
Irritably she walks into Rachel’s room shutting the door
behind her

GREG (VO)
Yeah I know I told you she didn’t
die But I mean this is a story
about a girl with cancer

Greg is left alone in a hospital hallway

GREG (VO)
What did you think was going to
happen
INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - THE NEXT DAY 89

GREG EARL and MR MCCARTHY are sitting all in a row near
the back The forceful inner-city PRINCIPAL is speaking

PRINCIPAL

It is indeed a difficult time
for the Schenley High School
family We are mourning a family
member But we have an unexpected
and touching opportunity to turn
our thoughts to her in a unique
way

(with God’s own voice)
EARL JACKSON GREGORY GAINES
Please come to the stage

Gregs heart skips a beat His eyes widen with terror

INT HOSPITAL HALLWAY - FLASHBACK LAST NIGHT 90

From the hall through the half-open door DENISE watches the
film projected on Rachel’s curtain

PRINCIPAL (VO)
These boys made a film that they
delivered to Rachel last night

Blue 94
INT HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM 91
BACK TO THE PRESENT

Earl has his head deep in his hands

INT TEACHER’S CONFERENCE ROOM - FLASHBACK EARLIER THAT DAW

TEACHERS and the PRINCIPAL watch the film on a computer They
are very moved They are watching a sock puppet part

PRINCIPAL (VO)

And her mother has given us
permission to show you this film
now

BACK TO THE PRESENT 93

Greg and Earl are up on stage Cataclysm It is literally
the stuff of nightmares

PRINCIPAL
Before we show the film Is there
anything you would like to say
to the Schenley High School family

Earl walks to the lectern The mic is nowhere near his head

The PRINCIPAL noting this removes the microphone and holds
it to Earl’s mouth

EARL
Naw

PRINCIPAL
You will let this audacious film
speak for you Very good Gregory

Greg staggers to his feet He takes the mic He gazes out at
his classmates

He has nothing to say to them But he can’t just say nothing
Suddenly he begins speaking

GREG
This film sucks And after you
watch it you’re gonna think I’m
this pathetic untalented loser But
here’s the thing I don’t care what
you think about me I’ve spent the
last four years obsessing over how
everyone sees me and I just
realized I don’t care anymore

(MORE )
Blue 95
GREG (CONTD)
The only person whose opinion I
care about is dead So whatever

He puts the mic down then decides to pick it back up

GREG (CONT’D)
I’ve always wanted never to be
noticed by anyone But the best way
not to be noticed is to be dead
And I don’t want to be dead

He puts the mic back The principal frowning walks over to
reclaim the mic

Then Greg abruptly grabs it a third time

GREG (CONTD)
Wait Here’s why our film sucks
It’s not the film we should have
Made Okay Because I wasn’t even
friends with Rachel before she got
sick And then she got sick and we
spent all this time together but
it wasn’t enough It just wasn’t

To make the film we should have
made we should have gotten her to
tell us every single thought she
has ever had Because it’s all just
lost now We should have had a
camera on her constantly since
the day she was born Because her
whole life now it’s just lost We
should have had a camera inside her
head because all of her specific
thoughts and ideas and hopes and
phobias and all of her impressions
of the whole stupid world they’re
all about to be lost and the film
we should have made would keep her
from being lost

And I know that happens to
everyone It’ll happen to everyone
in this room And it’1l happen to
me But I don’t care All that I
can think about is that it happened
to her And it happened last night
And I can’t deal with it I’1l
never be able to deal with it and
this film has nothing to do with
that Nothing

(forcing back tears--semi-

incoherent )

It sucks Nothing sucks more than
this It sucks

Blue 96
He puts down the mic and walks then runs offstage and out
of the auditorium The students are baffled Some of them are
giggling but from nervousness

Earl has his head in his hands

The lights go down

OMITTED 94

INT RACHEL’S LIVING ROOM - AFTERWARD 95
MOURNERS wander around Denise’s house sitting shiva

GREG spots MADISON and SCOTT MAYHEW together holding hands
talking to DENISE Surprised and sickened he avoids them

He gazes from afar at the URN on the mantel that contains
Rachel’s ashes He cannot stop looking at it It is absurd to
him in a way

Suddenly he has been cornered by an OLD PERSON -
ELDERLY MOURNER
I heard you made a very nice little

movie about Rachel’s life

GREG
Oh Uh yeah

ELDERLY MOURNER
When will it be in theaters
Blue 97

Greg does not have the heart to set this doddering old person
straight

GREG
Soon Really soon I’m sure Denise
will let you know Can you excuse
me for a moment

Greg sneaks into the kitchen He looks around for a place
where he can escape all human contact

He gazes out the window to the backyard and sees someone

EXT RACHEL’S BACKYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER 96
EARL has spent most of the shiva outside smoking irritably

GREG approaches him

EARL
Look who it is

GREG
Sorry I haven’t been out of my
room for a few days

EARL
Yeah I know You smell terrible

GREG
I can’t really smell myself

EARL
(matter-of-factly)
You smell like a homeless dude And
I heard even Pitt State ain’t takin
you no more

GREG
Yeah well Whatever

The backyard door opens DENISE

Squeak Squeak

Denise enters the house Greg holds the college directory
doing nothing

A couple of envelopes fall out He opens one

RACHEL (VO)
Dear Greg I heard what happened
with your classwork and with Pitt
State So I wrote them a letter
trying to convince them to let you
back in There’s a copy in here if
you want to read it Hopefully it
works because that would mean I
have powers from beyond the grave
But you should probably send them
something too

Goodbye Greg You’re a good
friend Although if you don’t go to
college you’re also an idiot But
you already knew that Love
Rachel

At “goodbye” Greg’s eyes blink and go wet
He unfolds the second letter--

so kind and sweet and giving that

He closes it He can’t read another word He closes his eyes
Earl clears his throat

already gut-wrenching enough out here

of misery)

middle of the living room scratching himself

Silence
Earl notices GREG’S MOM watching them through the window

She hesitates But she can’t help herself She gestures to
“smoking” to Earl then gestures “death” then gives hima
look of reproach

Earl shrugs baffled
She sticks her head out of the window -

GREG’S MOM
(whispering)
Earl it’s a little inappropriate
to be smoking a cigarette outside
of shiva Of someone who had
cancer

Oh Earl philosophically stubs out his cigarette

EARL
Sorry Mrs Gaines

She closes the window -

aint shit without me But that’s
what friends do They gotta watch
Even when they hate that shit

Yeah I called you my friend I’m

Greg is beginning to cry again Earl eyes him doubtfully

EARL (CONTD)
And you quit I’ma beat the hell
out of you All right

GREG

EARL

It’s easy as hell Because you
don’t know how to fight

GREG
All right

EARL
Goddammit stop cryin

GREG
I’m not c-crying

EARL
Cryin like a bitch

Earl after a resentful pause puts his arm around Greg He
pats Greg on the shoulder a few times

EARL (CONTD)
(irritably)
Feel like we’re having a goddamn
breakup right now C’mon Let’s go
inside

Earl goes into the house Greg just watches him quickly
become engulfed by the adults in there

He looks over at the FIRE ESCAPE leading to Rachel’s bedroom
window
INT RACHEL’S BEDROOM 97

GREG steps through the window and into Rachel’s room the
book under his arm the letters in his hand

He sits on her bed Surrounded by pillows
Blue 101A
He takes another look at the letter to him
RACHEL
PS I’d also like for you to take
some of my pillows They’1ll want a
good home where they’1ll be loved
Greg picks up Francesca
RACHEL (VO)
PPS Not in the way you’re
thinking That’s disgusting

He gazes at the walls Daniel Craig Hugh Jackman
A98

Blue 102
He looks down at his directory He opens it -

The inside has been CARVED OUT intricately into a little
landscape

He is motionless gazing at it It is beautiful and strange
There are three small figures in it Somehow we know they are
Rachel Greg and Earl Rachel’s has pink hair

He runs a finger over the lip of this little fantastical
place that her hands made

He gazes at her bookshelf He pulls out a book - no carving
in there - another one - again no carving - another -

This one is carved out too A different landscape Two
figures - Rachel (the same color but her old brown hair) and
one who is probably her mom

He finds more and more A world of landscapes Different
styles from different times in her life Sometimes he knows
who the figures are and sometimes he doesn’t The figure
that is her is always recognizable

There is no broad narrative connecting them They are just
scenes Not necessarily from her life - perhaps something
tangent to it

At some point we are no longer seeing the book carvings - we
are just watching his face as he SEES in a way that he never
has before

EXT MURRAY HILL SIDEWALK - AFTERNOON A98
Greg walks home slowly eyes fixed on something unseeable
somehow released Rachel’s house behind him

INT GREG’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 98

Were back to where we started GREG staring at a computer
monitor breathing loudly through his nose
Blue GREG (VO)
I know I might seem to you like I
hate myself and everything I do
But really I just hate everyone
I’ve ever been The person I am
right now is okay

Rachel’s ashes were scattered in a
park behind her house Apparently
she ran away from home once and
tried to live there

It was this story her aunt told at
the funeral She was trying to
become a squirrel She thought she
could turn into one by just being
in the forest and wanting it really
bad

I guess maybe that’s what Mr
McCarthy meant about someone’s
life continuing to unfold

It was weird to be learning
something new about Rachel after
she died But somehow it was
reassuring as well

The printer has just stopped printing the story we have just
been told On the back we see the words “Somehow it was

reassuring as well FIN”

He puts it in an envelope addressed to Pittsburgh State

University - Department of Admissions

And then he puts a DVD in a jewel case And then he sticks a
Post-It on top of the case and writes “WARNING THE LAST
PERSON WHO SAW THIS IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO A COMA AND DIED”

And he puts that in the envelope as well
He seals the envelope
He stares directly at us We look into his eyes

He crosses them briefly

BLACKOUT

NOW YOU ARE DEAD
