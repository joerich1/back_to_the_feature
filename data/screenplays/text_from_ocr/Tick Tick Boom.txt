INT THEATER - NIGHT - 1992 - VIDEO

Grainy VHS footage of a darkened stage against a bare brick
wall JON emerges from the wings striding confidently to
a microphone stand at the lip of the stage met by a smattering
of APPLAUSE

JON
Hi I’m Jon I am a musical theater
writer one of the last of my species

Some LAUGHTER from the Audience Jon frowns

JON (CONTD)
Lately I’ve been hearing this
sound Everywhere I go Like a
tick Tick Tick

We begin to hear it with him TICK TICK TICK

JON (CONT’D)
Like a time bomb in some cheesy B-
movie or Saturday morning cartoon The
fuse has been lit

The TICKING grows louder

JON (CONTD)
The clock counts down the seconds as
the flame gets closer and closer and
closer until all at once --

SMASH TO
INT MOONDANCE DINER - DAY - 1990 - VHS
More grainy footage from a shaky handheld camcorder Jon
appears behind the counter of the diner carrying a tray with
an elaborate breakfast spread a flower in his mouth
trumpeting his arrival -- making a complete idiot of himself
for the amusement of SUSAN seated at the counter
laughing deeply in love

Over the home video we begin to hear her VOICE

SUSAN (VO)
This is Jonathan Larson’s story

She pulls the flower from his mouth and kisses him

As we continue to hear her voice a series of QUICK CUTS to
archival footage --
- A CROWD wrapped around the block outside New York Theatre
Workshop in 1996

SUSAN (VO)
Before the Tony Awards

- CLOSE ON a flyer affixed to the door of the theater “All
performances of Rent through the March 31 extension are SOLD
OUT”

SUSAN (VO)
Before the Pulitzer Prize Before

The CUTS come faster --

- Another larger CROWD wrapped around the block outside of the
Nederlander Theatre in 1996 Rent emblazoned on the marquee

- Adam Pascal and Daphne Rubin-Vega on the cover of Newsweek

- On the stage of the Nederlander Theatre ANTHONY RAPP
costumed as Mark Cohen addresses the audience

ANTHONY RAPP
We dedicate this opening night and
every performance to our friend
Jonathan Larson

- JULIE and AL LARSON stand and applaud overcome by emotion
at the Tony Awards

SUSAN (V0)
we lost him

INT MOONDANCE DINER - DAY - 1990 - VHS
Back to the diner where Jon pops open a bottle of champagne
SUSAN (VO)

Everything you’re about to see is

true Except for the parts Jonathan

made up
INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon grabs the microphone crosses to a grand piano He sits at
the piano bench A small BAND and two vocalists KARESSA and
ROGER (both early 30s) are arrayed behind him

JON
The date is January 26th 1990
NOTE Throughout the film we move back and forth between Jon
in 1992 performing the show and the events he is narrating as

they occur in 1990

INT JON’S BEDROOM - DAY
Jon at the keyboard begins to find and play a CHORD
PROGRESSION out-of-time at first slowly beginning to take
shape the CHORDS of 3090
JON (VO)

The setting the barren unfashionable

no-man’s land between SoHo and

Greenwich Village
EXT DOWNTOWN STREET - MORNING
Jon bikes down the sidewalk outside of the Moondance Diner
INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon plays the same CHORD PROGRESSION on the grand piano

JON (VO)
I have two keyboards

INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
FLASH TO a boxy computer on a surprisingly well-organized desk

JON (VO)
-a Macintosh computer

FLASH TO Finster perched on the sofa

JON (VO)
a cat

FLASH TO his copious music library

JON (VO)
an impressive collection of
compact discs cassettes and records
of other people’s music

FLASH TO his precariously overstuffed bookshelves
JON (VO)
bookshelves sagging under the
weight of plays and novels I didnt
write

FLASH TO a type-written manuscript of Superbia
JON (VO)
I have an original dystopian rock
musical that I have spent the last
eight years of my life writing

INT JON’S BEDROOM - DAY
Jon sits on his bed keyboard on his lap completely
unbearably stuck

JON (VO)
and rewriting
(a beat)
And rewriting
INT THEATER - NIGHT
Back to Jon at the piano

JON (VO)
I have rejection letters from every
major -- and minor -- producer

theater company record label and film
studio in existence And in just over
a week I will be thirty years old
As the CHORD PROGRESSION begins to pick up speed --
INT LIVING ROOM - DAY
FLASH TO the cover of the West Side Story cast recording LP
JON (VO)
Older than Stephen Sondheim when he
had his first Broadway show
FLASH TO the cassette cover of The Beatles’ Let It Be
JON (VO)
Older than Paul McCartney when he
wrote his last song with John Lennon
FLASH TO an old home movie of little JON and JULIE
JON (VO)
By the time my parents were thirty
they already had two kids They had
careers with steady paychecks A
mortgage

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Back to Jon at the keyboard
JON
In eight days my youth will be over
forever And what exactly do I have to
show for myself

He STOPS playing He takes a breath in the silence

JON (CONTD)
Happy Birthday

He SLAMS his fingers back on the keys -- resuming the chord
progression as he begins to sing

JON (CONTD)
STOP THE CLOCK -- TAKE TIME OUT
TIME TO REGROUP BEFORE YOU LOSE THE
BOUT

The Band comes in behind him as the song picks up energy

JON (CONT’D)
FREEZE THE FRAME -- BACK IT UP
TIME TO REFOCUS BEFORE THEY WRAP IT UP
YEARS ARE GETTING SHORTER
LINES ON YOUR FACE ARE GETTING LONGER
FEEL LIKE YOURE TREADING WATER
BUT THE RIPTIDES GETTING STRONGER
DONT PANIC DONT JUMP SHIP
CANT FIGHT IT LIKE TAXES
AT LEAST IT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN YOUR
LIFE

THEYRE SINGING HAPPY BIRTHDAY

YOU JUST WANNA LAY DOWN AND CRY

NOT JUST ANOTHER BIRTHDAY ITS 3090
WHY CANT YOU STAY 29

HELL YOU STILL FEEL LIKE YOURE 22
TURN THIRTY 1990

BANG YOURE DEAD

WHAT CAN YOU DO

WHAT CAN YOU DO

WHAT CAN YOU DO

As the Band continues to UNDERSCORE --
INT MOONDANCE DINER - DAY
Lunch at the diner bustling with patrons Jon behind the
counter MICHAEL hurries through the door

MICHAEL
I made ten copies
He hands Jon a thick stack of photocopies as Jon hands him a
cup of coffee and a bag of take-out in exchange Jon glances
through the stack sheet music and scripts for Superbia

JON
You are an angel on earth

MICHAEL
This is the last time Seriously

Michael reaches for his wallet Jon shuts it down fast

JON

No thank you No no no I got you
MICHAEL

I’m going to pay
JON

You’re not going to pay I don’t want

you to pay

CAROLYN comes by carrying a tray full of dirty dishes
wrinkling her nose at the smell

CAROLYN
Somebody needs to take out this trash

FREDDY comes over to Michael carrying his own tray of
dirty dishes as Jon goes to handle the trash

FREDDY
I heard youre moving out of Jon’s
place End of an era
(sotto)
We hear him sobbing in the fridge most
mornings It’s very sad

JON
(to Carolyn)
Youre coming next Friday right

CAROLYN
(feigning ignorance)
What’s next Friday

Before Jon can answer --

MICHAEL AND FREDDY
The Superbia workshop

MICHAEL
I’m surprised he hasn’t mentioned it
FREDDY
It sounds vaguely familiar

JON
(defensive)
This is the biggest break I’ve ever
had This is that moment It’s the
first time people are going to see the
show that aren’t just us

FREDDY
Well it’s good that you’re not
putting too much pressure on it or
anything

Carolyn and Michael laugh

JON
No but it’s true though You get to
a certain age and you stop being a
writer that waits tables and you
become a waiter with a hobby

MICHAEL
Boo Boo You need to ask yourself in
this moment are you letting yourself
be led by fear or by love

As Jon considers the question he hefts the trash bag out of
its bin The bottom rips sending some kind of unidentifiable
liquid all over his shoes

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Roger launches into the next verse of the song

ROGER
CLEAR THE RUNWAY -- MAKE ANOTHER PASS
TRY ONE MORE APPROACH BEFORE YOURE
OUT OF GAS

JON
FRIENDS ARE GETTING FATTER
HAIRS ON YOUR HEAD ARE GETTING THINNER
FEEL LIKE A CLEAN UP BATTER
ON A TEAM THAT AINT A WINNER

ROGER
DONT FREAK OUT DONT STRIKE OUT
CANT FIGHT IT LIKE CITY HALL

JON
AT LEAST YOURE NOT ALONE
YOUR FRIENDS ARE THERE TOO
INT JON’S APARTMENT - DAY

together as Jon helps stack boxes with Michael

As the Band continues to UNDERSCORE --
INT STRAND BOOK STORE - DAY
Jon walks beside Susan through the dusty stacks Susan staring
at him in disbelief

SUSAN

You just quit
JON

I didn’t quit quit I gave my notice
SUSAN

That’s exactly -- it’s the same thing
JON

No I still have two weeks left

Jon spies a beautiful book of expensive music manuscript paper
He picks it up
JON (CONTD)
I’m allowing myself to be led by love

SUSAN
(perplexed)
What

JON
Rosa has another client -- remember
Craig Carnelia

SUSAN
This is Rosa your agent who hasn’t
returned your calls in a year

JON

That’s the one She invited the entire
theater industry to a workshop of
Craig’s musical last year By
intermission some producer had
already written him a check for ten
thousand dollars

SUSAN
I wish you didn’t have to think like
that

JON

It’s expensive to make art

SUSAN
No it’s expensive to make art here

JON
But worth every penny

Susan nods to the book of manuscript paper

SUSAN
How are you going to pay for that

Susan gently takes the book out of his hands As Jon follows
her down the aisle the PATRONS around them join in singing

JON SUSAN AND PATRONS

Friday night

INT LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Streamers and balloons fill the apartment as Michael stands by
the answering machine scrolling through messages suitcase at
his feet After a BEEP --

DEBORAH (VO)
Hi Jonathan it’s Deborah Susan just
dropped off your music for tonight’s
dance recital --

Michael fast-forwards through the message his impatience
betraying some anxiety Deborah’s voice returns
DEBORAH (VO)
-- but I can’t get the speakers to
work --

Jon enters grocery bags in hand Michael stops the message

JON
How was Philly

MICHAEL
I went from the airport to a
conference room and then back to the
airport three hours later

JON
That sounds amazing

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon speaks at the microphone at the front of the stage

JON
Michael was an amazing actor He was
the lead in every play in high school
college Then we moved to New York

EXT ROOF - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Michael frustrated vents to Jon as they stand together
passing a joint

MICHAEL

I am sick of waking up at five to get
in line outside the Equity building
and wait all day -- praying that the
director actually agrees to even see
anyone that’s non-union And then when
I finally do get in the room I sing
six measures if I’m lucky before they
cut me off and call me the wrong name -
- Juan Pedro Carlos lo que sea

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon back at the microphone

JON
A week later he got a job at a fancy
advertising company making high-five
figures Health care Dental He never
looked back

INT LIVING ROOM - EVENING
Back to the apartment Jon pulls some top-shelf liquor from the
bags sets it on the table beside a vase of bodega flowers

MICHAEL
You know for someone who’s broke you
could probably spend a little bit less
on party planning

JON
What’s the point of having money if
you can’t spend it on the people you
love

MICHAEL
(laughing)
Yeah except you don’t have any money

JON
Oh right

Michael sees a Con Edison bill on the table picks it up

MICHAEL

This has been sitting here for a week
JON

I’m on it
MICHAEL

Yes you seem very on it
Michael grabs his suitcase takes it to his room to unpack

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
Pretty soon you won’t have me around
to remind you to pay bills on time

JON
(facetious)
How will I ever survive

MICHAEL
That’s actually a very real question
Have you found a new roommate yet

JON
I’ve been a little busy My workshop
is next week

MICHAEL
What workshop
Jon is about to be offended when he realizes

JON
That was funny

Jon reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out his small
spiral-ring notebook and a pencil He scribbles on a blank
page “Fear or love” He underlines the words Michael calls
from the bedroom

MICHAEL
What time’s the show tonight

JON
Curtain’s at eight

MICHAEL
I’ve heard the dancing is amazing but
the music sucks

As we PRE-LAP a propulsive dance score --

INT DANCE THEATER - NIGHT
Jon sits in the audience beside Michael watching the show an

athletic piece for eight female DANCERS moving to the score
that Jon wrote Jon’s eyes are riveted on Susan

JON (V0)
Susan grew up in a small town in the
Midwest went to college to study
biology She thought she’d become a
doctor -- maybe teach But then she
fell in love with modern dance instead
-- every parents’ dream right She
moved to New York without knowing a
soul Four years later she’s already
danced with every major choreographer
in the city -- Paul Trisha Merce

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon stands with the microphone

JON
1990 This was the year she was
finally going to join a company Not
just go from job to job -- actually
have a home an artistic family And
she was ready This was her year She
knew it Then she fractured her ankle
during a dress rehearsal Six months
of rehab later she’s dancing again
It’s just

(MORE)

JON (CONTD)

whatever that moment was when she
knew all of a sudden she doesn’t
know anymore

(a beat)
Susan is a real artist She doesn’t
care about seeing her name in the New
York Times It doesn’t matter to her
if she’s dancing in front of five
people or five thousand

INT DANCE THEATER - NIGHT
Seated in the audience Jon hears the sudden sound of TICKING
underneath the SCORE

JON (VO)
And then there’s the matter of us

As the Dancers hit a final pose and the stage lights fade out
Jon joins the rest of the Audience in applauding -- the
CLAPPING and CHEERS drowning out the TICKING altogether

INT JON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT
A raucous cast party underway the tiny living room jam-packed
with FRIENDS Wine and beer flow Susan stands with Michael

SUSAN
You know he can’t afford any of this
right

MICHAEL

Well you know how much he loves
making a fuss Especially about you

Susan smiles something nagging at her
INT JON’S APARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
Jon huddles with Freddy and Carolyn
FREDDY
After everything we’ve done for him
he walks away
JON
I’m leaving you my mix tapes You can

play them in remembrance of me

Michael comes by carrying two glasses of wine one of which he
hands to Carolyn

MICHAEL
Jonathan Larson’s famous Moondance
Diner mix tapes Who doesn’t love show
tunes with their French Toast

JON
Actually it’s not just show tunes
It’s a very eclectic mix

CAROLYN
Someone’s very touchy about the mix
tapes

MICHAEL

FREDDY

want to be overly optimistic

FREDDY

Stand clear of the closing doors or

God I’m talking to you in the back

IRA (PRE-LAP)
You still don’t have the song

INT MOONDANCE DINER - MINUTES LATER
Jon sits at a table across from IRA WEITZMAN cups of coffee
and a script of Superbia between them

JON
This has never happened to me before
I usually write a song in a day Last
week I wrote a song about sugar in
three hours

IRA
(puzzled)
A song about sugar

Jon sings a bit of SUGAR a cappella

JON
SUGAR SHE’S REFINED
FOR A SMALL PRICE
SHE BLOWS MY MIND

IRA

Why would you do that
JON

It was an exercise
IRA

In what
JON

I like to see if I can write a song
about anything

IRA
Why don’t you try to see if you can
write a song for your musical that’s
being presented to an audience in six
days instead

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Back to Jon on stage

JON
Ira Weitzman Head of Musical Theater
at Playwrights Horizons The first
and so far only actual theater
person to offer to put on a workshop
of Superbia

INT MOONDANCE DINER - DAY
Back to Jon and Ira at the Diner
JON
I’m starting to think that maybe I

don’t need it

IRA
You do

JON
You know you’re the only person who’s
ever said that Just so you know
IRA
Youre telling me in the five years
youve been writing this musical --
INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon stands at the lip of the stage

JON
Eight years actually

INT LIFE CAFE - DAY
The scene RESUMES where it stopped Ira in mid-sentence
IRA
-- no one else has told you that
youre missing a song for Elizabeth in
the second act
JON
JON (VO)
Okay I’m lying
INT THEATER - NIGHT
Back to Jon with the mic at the front of the stage

JON

One person did say that

(then)
For years I was part of this musical
theater writing workshop

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - NIGHT
A dozen aspiring musical WRITERS sit in rows of folding chairs
as Jon sits at a piano and sings a section of LCD READOUT

JON
LIQUID CRYSTAL DIGITAL READOUT
FLOATING ON A SEA OF GRAY
HELP ME FALL ASLEEP
IM TIRED
ITS NEARLY THE BREAK OF DAY

JON (VO)
Once a week we would gather -- the
few surviving members of our dwindling
tribe -- to watch one of us present
what we were working on to a panel of
well real writers

JON
LIQUID CRYSTAL DIGITAL READOUT
DIVIDING THE DAY AWAY

JON (VO)
The theater legends who’d created the
Broadway shows we’d grown up dragging
our parents into the city to see

JON
COUNTING SLOWLY MEASURING MOMENTS
IF YOU COULD TALK WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

Seated on the other

side of the room we PAN slowly over WALTER

BLOOM (50s) a successful musical theater writer stone-faced
watching Jon perform

JON (V0)

The panel would change every week The

night I
buzz as
door --

PANNING past Bloom

Stephen

presented people began to
soon as we walked through the
“Is it really him” It was

we LAND on STEPHEN SONDHEIM JON (VO)
Sondheim

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - LATER
Four folding chairs are now arranged at the front of the room
Jon sits on display listening to Bloom critique his work

WALTER BLOOM
Okay I’ll start I’m lost I don’t
know what the show is Is it social
commentary Is it science fiction And

the music it’s the same thing Is
it rock Is it Broadway Is it both
Neither

(turns to Sondheim)
Steve What do you think

SONDHEIM
I have to say I disagree pretty
strongly Walter I think this is a
musical that knows exactly what it is

WALTER BLOOM
Yes Of course Yes Absolutely

SONDHEIM

(to Jon)
The world you’ve created is really
original It’s fascinating The
problem is that it’s not terribly easy
to follow the emotional thread The
details distract us from connecting
with the characters Does that make
sense

Walter nods as though this is what he said too

WALTER BLOOM
Yes we’re on the same page here
That’s exactly how I felt We’re
saying the same thing Just
differently But the music I’m
sorry the music just wasn’t there

SONDHEIM
I actually thought the songs were
swell

WALTER BLOOM
As did I The individual songs

SONDHEIM
I particularly liked the one the young
man sings at the end of the first act
First-rate lyric And tune
The aspiring composers in the room share stupefied glances

JON (VO)
“First-rate lyric And tune”

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon beams at the audience

JON
Those five words were enough to keep
me going for the next two years

SONDHEIM (PRE-LAP)
You’re missing a song

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - LATER - NIGHT
At the end of class the other writers finish clearing out
Jon packs up his things Sondheim approaches

SONDHEIM
(forgetting the name)
For the young woman

JON
Elizabeth

SONDHEIM
Elizabeth It’s the turning point of
the show Your protagonist is either
going in this direction or that
direction Somebody needs to wake him
up shake some sense into him

WALTER BLOOM
You know it’s funny

We WIDEN to find Walter seated listening in on the
conversation

WALTER
I was going to say the exact same
thing

JON (PRE-LAP)
Can we talk about musicians

INT MOONDANCE DINER - DAY
Back to the Diner as Ira frowns not sure what he means

as

JON
Because if it’s only four I need to
figure out how to divide the bass

parts --

IRA
Jon This is a reading You’ll have a
piano

JON

I wrote a rock score At the very
least I need drums a synth guitar --

IRA
A great song should sound great
without any instruments

JON
Youre right Let’s do it a cappella
Or you know what Let’s just skip the
songs We can get the audience in and
out in half an hour
Ira sighs -- things always escalate the same way with Jon

IRA
I will look at the budget and try to
dig up money for another musician
JON
Two more and piano is the absolute
bare minimum for this

IRA
Have you spoken to Rosa

As Jon takes in the question --
FLASH TO
INT JON’S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK
Jon paces on the phone
JON

Hey Rosa This is Jonathan Larson

your client I’ve left multiple

messages with your secretary --

Rosa Stevens is still your agent

JON

Oh yeah no we talk constantly

IRA
Has she sent out invites for the
presentation yet We haven’t gotten a
lot of RSVPs

Jons stomach sinks

IRA (CONTD)

been outlawed This will be the first
musical for the MTV generation this

half a million dollars

IRA

So far we’re up to twelve RSVPs Jon
You don’t need a band with an audience
of twelve people -- you’1l outnumber
them

If you want more musicians you’re
going to have to find the money for it
somewhere else I’m sorry

JON
Thank you for everything

to stop his racing thoughts

As we PRE-LAP the sound of a drum ROLL
INT THEATER - NIGHT
Karessa and Jon pull their stools to the lip of the stage
JON

And now ladies and gentlemen we

present you with scenes from a modern

romance As told in song
The CRASH of a cymbal as the MUSIC for THERAPY creeps in the

zippy playful tone in stark contrast to Jon and Susan’s
argument

We INTERCUT throughout between the THEATER and the APARTMENT

the two in jagged juxtaposition

- BACK TO APARTMENT

SUSAN

simply vanished And then Susan realizes with horror --

JON AND KARESSA
SO LET’S JUST GET SOME REST

The song BUTTONS and the Audience APPLAUDS wildly a good time
had by all

INT OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
A table in a sleek corporate conference room Already assembled
there dressed in impeccable business attire and wearing name-
tags are PEGGY (20s) TODD (40s) and KIM (50s) At the front
of the room JUDY (30s) standing beside a large easel pad
checks the time

JUDY
We’re just waiting on one more
person

Looking the worse for wear after a night without sleep and
dressed in a hastily assembled outfit of jeans and a t-shirt
Jon appears at the door

JON
Hi I’m Jonathan --

JUDY
Yes Mr Larson You’re Michael’s
friend

JON

How are you

JUDY
Youre late

JON
Okay sorry about that

She holds open the door gesturing for him to take a seat Jon
nods to the others and sits Kim smiles at him

KIM
Welcome

As Judy stands in front of the table beside a large easel pad
Jon leans over to Peggy whispering

JON
Did she say anything about when we get
paid

She ignores him doesn’t want to be associated with the late
guy

JUDY
So Now that we’re all here why
don’t we begin with a quick
brainstorming session Just to get
those creative juices flowing

JON (VO)
Two hours of this

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon stands at the front of the stage at the mic

JON
For one extra musician

INT OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
JUDY
So why don’t we just start by throwing
out some ideas that come to mind when
I say the word “America”

PEGGY
George Washington

JUDY
Excellent

Judy writes the ideas on the pad as they are called out

TODD
Abraham Lincoln

JON (VO)
(in his head)
Empire racism genocide Vietnam
(out loud)
Grover Cleveland

A slight pause Judy nods writes this on the pad

KIM
The Constitution

JUDY
Yes

JON
Magna Carta

Another slight pause Judy nods writes down the suggestion
Jon suddenly realizes that he’s losing

PEGGY
The Bill of Rights

TODD
The right thing to do

KIM
The right stuff

JON
An open road at sunset The wind in
your hair Nothing in your way but the
horizon

Judy turns to look at him A beat Unclear what she’s thinking
Finally --

JUDY
That is beautiful Mr Larson

Jon can’t help but swell with the compliment
INT CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER
A series of QUICK SHOTS of people at the table one by one as
they give rapid-fire answers

PEGGY
The sun

TODD
Sunrise

JON
The dawn of a new day

JUDY
That is incredible

PEGGY
A window looking out on a field

KIM
Aww I think of cute little bunnies
and cute little squirrelys

JON
The beating heart of the nation

JUDY
(savoring this)
Mmm Absolutely

Jon watches as Judy picks up her clipboard circles his name

JON (VO)
I could get used to this

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon begins to daydream at the microphone

JON
I could get paid for this I could get
health care a 401K a BMW a luxury
apartment on Central Park West -- no
no no -- East I could actually be
rewarded for my creativity instead of
rejected and ignored

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER
Jon smiles to himself as Judy tears off the current sheet on
the easel pad a new blank sheet underneath

JON (VO)
This could be the rest of my life

JUDY
Now that we have all of those fabulous
ideas of yours in our heads we are
going to turn to our real task

(MORE )
JUDY (CONTD)
We are here to develop the name for a
revolutionary consumer product that is
just about to hit your shelves

KIM
Oh wow

JUDY

This is where we’re going to need that
incredible imagination of yours Mr
Larson

(then)
The product we are looking at is a
tasteless odorless chemical compound
that will be used as a fat substitute
in cooking It’s been tested
successfully on a number of mammals

Jon begins to get a queasy feeling about this

JUDY (CONT’D)
Now there are some side effects
associated with the product that I’ve
been instructed to tell you about

Jon realizes with a shudder

JON (VO)
This could be the rest of my life

Judy finishes reading the long list of side effects

JUDY
- and finally in a small number of
users there were reports of toxic
shock syndrome resulting in brief
hospitalization

She plasters the wide smile back on

JUDY (CONT’D)
There are no bad ideas

Jon suddenly notices the large wall clock above her for the

first time -- TICK TICK TICK His breathing gets shallower

PEGGY
Free Oil

JUDY
Love it

KIM
Oil Free

JON
That’s the same thing she just said

KIM
(defensive)
I switched the words around though

JUDY
(a look to Jon)
That’s perfectly fine Kim thank you

Jon stares at the clock as the ideas come furiously from
everyone else He seems to be able to feel brain cells dying

PEGGY
The American Dream

KIM
Dreams of Freedom

TODD
Nutra Oil

JUDY

That’s not bad Todd
Finally Jon interjects loudly enthusiastically
JON
I’ve got it I have it I know exactly
what it should be

Everyone looks to him expectantly He emphasizes each syllable

JON (CONTD)
“Chubstitute”

EXT MIDTOWN STREET - NIGHT
Michael and Jon walk down a busy sidewalk toward the subway
the street teeming with rush hour traffic Michael furious

MICHAEL
“Chubstitute”

JON
It was a joke

MICHAEL
It’s not funny

JON
Maybe not to you
MICHAEL
I recommended you Jon I put my name
on the line for you

JON
Tell them I had a stroke

MICHAEL
(exploding)
It isn’t funny

Jon goes silent surprised by his response as Michael stops
there on the sidewalk turns to him

MICHAEL (CONT’D)
This is my life

JON
It’s not your life It’s advertising
It’s figuring out how to trick people
into buying shit they don’t want

MICHAEL
Actually it’s a lot more complicated
than that

JON

I don’t understand how you can take
any of this seriously

MICHAEL
Because they pay me to

JON
Money isn’t everything

MICHAEL
Well it doesn’t hurt

JON
Are you sure about that

MICHAEL
What are you doing with your life
that’s so noble

JON
Making art

MICHAEL
Oh that’s what the world needs More
art
JON
Actually yes and at least I’m not
helping perpetuate a system that is
destroying --

MICHAEL
Oh spare me the self-righteousness
Jon Youre writing musicals in your
living room not saving the rain
forest

JON
Wow I wish I could be more like you
and spend my life caring about driving
the right car and wearing the right
suits and living in a doorman
building

MICHAEL
Why shouldn’t I care about those
things Not everyone has the options
you do Jon All the things you take
for granted

JON
Like what

MICHAEL

Like a life with a person you love
Do you know what I would give to have
that And you turn your nose up at it

JON
If that’s what you want what’s
stopping you

MICHAEL

What’s stopping me How about Jesse
Helms and the Moral Majority How
about the people that run this
country I can’t get married I can’t
have kids Half of our friends are
dying and the other half are scared
to death they’re next So yes I’m
sorry for buying a nice car Jon I’m
sorry for living in an apartment with
central heating I’m sorry for
enjoying my life while I still have
time

(stops himself)
I have to go

He heads off in the opposite direction

JON
Youre not taking the subway

MICHAEL
Id rather walk

JON
Michael Michael

But Michael just keeps going As Jon watches him disappear down
the sidewalk there it is again -- TICK TICK TICK

emerges from the water every few seconds to breathe the Woman

beside the pool seems to transform into Susan then back to the

Woman

As he hits forty laps he stops drained empty He lets go
allowing his body to sink As he reaches the bottom he begins
to notice the lines on the tiles start to shift blurring
unraveling slowly rearranging themselves into a musical staff

it He goes to sit in it

JON
That’s for someone else actually

NAN
(a look to Al)
Do you like that

Jon gestures to the empty room

JON
You can literally sit in any other
seat

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - LATER
Half the seats are now taken and the room is alive with
CHATTER and anticipation as Michael approaches Jon some
trepidation between them after the way they last left things

MICHAEL
Good turnout

JON
Yeah It’s mostly friends

MICHAEL
(sarcastic)
What a nightmare

JON
(smiles a beat)
Thank you For coming

MICHAEL
Wild horses Jon You know that

As Michael takes a seat Jon glances at the Reserved seat
still empty He checks his watch

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - LATER
The room is now nearly full Rosa Stevens enters She looks
around Jon watches her approach a random man

ROSA
Jonathan How are you

As the man turns around confused Jon races to save him

JON
Rosa Jon Larson

ROSA
(plays it off)
There he is Just the man I’m looking
for Are you nervous Don’t be
nervous

JON
I’m a little nervous

ROSA
Of course you’re nervous The first
presentation of your musical is like
having a colonoscopy in the middle of
Times Square Only with a
colonoscopy the worst thing that
could happen is you find out you have
cancer With a musical you find out
youre already dead

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - LATER
The room is now packed Jon stands on the side of the room
glancing anxiously from the door to the still-empty seat with
the Reserved sign Ira approaches him

IRA
We can’t keep waiting It’s quarter
past

Jon finally nods Ira puts a hand on his shoulder

IRA (CONT’D)
Break a leg

Ira takes the Reserved sign off the seat and sits Jon finally
accepts that Susan isn’t coming He looks around the packed
room steeling himself to say something

JON
Hi Good morning Thank you Welcome
I’m Jonathan Larson

Michael leads the applause The rest of the room slowly joins

JON (CONT’D)
That’s you really don’t have to do
that That’s very kind Thank you
Okay Thank you all so much for being
here this morning --

The door OPENS and Jon turns expecting to see Susan there
Instead in walks Stephen Sondheim He ducks into a seat in the
back row Jon takes a moment to recover from his shock

JON (CONT’D)
Right Like I was saying thank you
This is my musical Superbia I’ve
been working on it for a little
while now I really hope you like it

APPLAUSE as Jon finds a seat in the front row
INT THEATER - NIGHT

unreadable

Then Karessa steps forward to sing the
new song not even twelve hours old

INT THEATER - NIGHT
Jon sits at the piano as Karessa approaches the microphone at
the lip of the stage

JON
I close my eyes I brace myself I
don’t dare take a breath

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY
From behind we see the figure of Karessa set her music stand

at a microphone downstage mirroring her movements from the
concert in 1992

JON (VO)
But when I open my eyes I don’t see
Karessa there

Jon opens his eyes REVERSE to find --
EXT ROOF - NIGHT
Susan stands on the roof Jon sits in a folding chair watching
as she sings COME TO YOUR SENSES

SUSAN
YOURE ON THE AIR

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY
Karessa sings

KARESSA

between the Studio and the Roof

KARESSA AND SUSAN

BABY COME BACK ALIVE

INT REHEARSAL STUDIO - DAY
An explosion of APPLAUSE rings out and Jon looks to the front
of the room where Karessa now bows Jon smiles at the raucous
response to the song but he cannot help but feel a pang of
something else -- something like regret

INT JON’S APARTMENT - LATER
Jon paces staring at the phone waiting for it to RING
Finally it does He answers immediately

JON (ON PHONE)
Hello

INT ROSA STEVENS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
Rosa sits at her desk on the call

ROSA (ON PHONE)
Hi honey it’s Rosa

INTERCUT throughout between them Jon sighs in relief

JON (ON PHONE)
Thank you so much for calling

ROSA (ON PHONE)
Well youve already left six
messages
JON (ON PHONE)
Have you heard anything yet

ROSA (ON PHONE)
Honey I have heard nothing but raves
I’m getting call after call after
call

JON (ON PHONE)
Wow Okay That’s great news

ROSA (ON PHONE)
Everybody is telling me the same
thing “That Jonathan Larson -- I
can’t wait to see what he does next”

JON (ON PHONE)
What do you mean what I do next What
about Superbia

Rosa acts like they have discussed this already like she
didn’t predict a bidding war fifteen hours ago

ROSA (ON PHONE)

I always told you this was a tough
sell It’s too arty for Broadway --
tourists aren’t going to shell out
fifty dollars to see a show about
spaceships and robots

JON (ON PHONE)
Well that’s not what it’s about

ROSA (ON PHONE)

Well of course I know that Jonathan
But these producers they care about
one thing and one thing only

JON (ON PHONE)
What about Off-Broadway

ROSA (ON PHONE)
It’s too expensive for Off You’ve got
a cast of thousands special
effects

She puts her hand over the phone calls to her Assistant

ROSA (ON PHONE) (CONTD)
Tell him I’1l be on in a second
(to Jon)
Listen sweetie I’ve got to run
Congratulations on a terrific
presentation

JON (ON PHONE)
But what am I supposed to do now

Rosa frowns confused by the question -- isn’t it obvious

ROSA (ON PHONE)
You start writing the next one And
after you finish that one you start
the next And on and on That’s what
it is to be a writer honey You just
keep throwing them against the wall
and hoping against hope that
eventually something sticks

(then)

Listen A little advice from someone
that’s been in this business a long
long time On the next one maybe
try writing about what you know

Jon looks around at his tiny dingy apartment the world he
knows

INT MICHAEL’S OFFICE - DAY
Michael stands by his desk in a small-ish office on the phone

MICHAEL (ON PHONE)
I think let’s give it a minute and see
what happens next week

Jon enters

JON
I need a job I’1l1 apologize to the
focus group lady I’1ll never say
anything bad about marketing research
ever again I swear to God

MICHAEL (ON PHONE)
I’m going to call you right back

He hangs up the phone

JON
I want to do what you do I want to
have what you have I want the BMW I
want the doorman I want all of it

MICHAEL
What is going on

JON
I spent eight years killing myself on
a musical that is never going to
happen

MICHAEL
I find that very hard to believe It
was incredible this morning

JON

Well not incredible enough

(then)
I can’t do it again Mike I can’t
stomach five more years of waiting
tables five more years of writing
things that no one will ever see while
Broadway just churns out mega-musicals
without a hint of anything original or
interesting or God forbid something
to actually say about the world

Michael allows him to go on patiently When he’s finished he
calmly responds

MICHAEL
Are you done

JON
No actually --

MICHAEL
(cutting him off)
The presentation was Jon it was
amazing It would be a tragedy to give
up what you have

JON
You did it
MICHAEL
Please I was a mediocre actor -- do

you know how many mediocre actors
there are in New York City Do you
know how many Jonathan Larsons there
are One

JON
I can’t keep wasting my time Mike I
turn thirty in two days

MICHAEL
And
JON
Stephen Sondheim was twenty-seven when
he had his first musical on Broadway

MICHAEL
Well guess what You’re not Stephen
Sondheim You’re going to have to wait
a little bit longer

Jon begins to spiral

JON
I can’t keep waiting This is my life

MICHAEL
I understand

JON
You don’t understand I’m running out
of time

MICHAEL
(scoffs)
You are not running out of time

JON
You don’t know anything about it

MICHAEL
(quietly)
I’m HIV positive

A long terrible silence

JON
What
(Michael says nothing)
How long have you

MICHAEL

A few days

(then)
Who knows I might get lucky People
do They live a year longer even

(a stoic smile)
Anyway I think I might know a thing
or two about running out of time

Jon stands there reeling as the TICKING returns

JON
Why didn’t you tell me sooner

Michael gives him a look Jon realizes with a sickened
feeling

JON (CONTD)

He holds the phone away from his ear struggling to process the
news he has just heard He sings REAL LIFE

heartbeat is pounding in my IS THIS REAL
throat The wind is shrieking IS THIS REAL
through the trees The sky is IS THIS REAL

darkening I want it to stop I
want it all to stop

Jon suddenly sees something out of the corner of his eye He
stops The singing stops

Dozens of SEAGULLS perch on a nearby hill seemingly watching
him He stands there looking at them

The birds take to the air en masse flying away Jon follows
the birds with his eyes -- to the Delacorte an exquisite
outdoor theater a hundred yards away

EXT CENTRAL PARK - MINUTES LATER - NIGHT
Jon stands outside the theater the TICKING unabated He peers
in through the chain-link fence and sees a rehearsal piano
covered by a tarp He begins to climb the fence

EXT DELACORTE THEATER - MOMENTS LATER
Jon looks around sees that he is alone He delicately pulls
the tarp from the piano He sits at the bench and puts his
hands over the keys All at once the TICKING stops The only
thing he can hear is the sound of his own breathing He begins
to play WHY tentatively at first passion and intensity
building with the song

RINGS The outgoing MESSAGE sounds

JON (VO)
Speak

SONDHEIM (VO)
Jon Steve Sondheim here Rosa gave me
this number I hope it’s okay to call

(Jon freezes stunned)
I didn’t get a chance to speak with
you after your reading but I just
wanted to say it was really good
Congratulations I’d love to get
together and talk to you about it if
you have any interest No pressure

Jon laughs -- as if he might not have interest in that

SONDHEIM (V0O)
The main thing though is that it’s
first-rate work and it has a future
And so do you I’1l call you later
with some thoughts if that’s okay
Meanwhile be proud

As Jon turns to go we see that the papers on the floor are a
dozen pages torn out from his small spiral notebook -- filled
with questions “Fear or love” “Why do we follow leaders that
don’t lead” Etc

INT MOONDANCE DINER - NIGHT
A CLOSED sign hangs on the door of the Moondance filled with a
dozen or so FRIENDS of Jon’s Jon huddles with Carolyn

CAROLYN
There was a small very very small
part of me that was the teensiest

bit happy to hear you’re not leaving
JON
Well I would have been sad not to see
you every Sunday morning

CAROLYN

agent

JON

wanted to buy at the Strand days earlier She smiles

SUSAN (CONTD)
For the next one Do you have any
ideas

JON
(shakes his head)

SUSAN
That seems like a really good place to
start
(then)
Goodbye Jonathan

Susan turns and goes Jon stands there looking after her As
he does we hear her VOICE

SUSAN (V0)
The next one was tick tickboom
After that he went back to a project
he’d started and put away called
Rent It ran on Broadway for twelve
years It changed the definition of
what a musical could be What it could
sound like The kinds of stories that
it could tell Jonathan never got to
see it The night of the show’s final
dress rehearsal he died from a sudden
aortic aneurysm He was thirty-five
years old

EXT NEW YORK THEATER WORKSHOP - NIGHT
Before the show Some last-minute STRAGGLERS make their way
into the theater
