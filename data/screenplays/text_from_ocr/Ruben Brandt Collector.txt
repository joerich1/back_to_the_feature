0010 INT - NIGHTMARE - RAILCAR - EVENINGNIGHT

RUBEN BRANDT is alone in the railcar sitting by the
window reading a book The monotonous clatter of the train
is lulling him to sleep He gets up and heads to the toilet
through the empty hallway The train goes into a tunnel The
hallway is dark He goes in to the bathroom He washes his
hands while whistling

Suddenly a little boy appears in the background The boy
wears breeches and a shirt stands in the bathtub and stares
Ruben in the face

Ruben wakes up in the railcar Another boy (FRANK DUVENECK’S
WHISTLING BOY 8) holding a snail is sitting in front of
him stares straight into his eyes while whistling

A window abruptly falls open and a strong gust of wind slaps
Ruben in the face Ruben is horrified a little girl
(VELAZQUEZ’S INFANTA MARGARITA 7) is hanging outside the
railcar

RUBEN BRANDT
Hey

Her fingers can barely grasp the metal frame of the open
window She screams for help

INFANTA MARGARITA
(shouts )
Help me Help me

The moment Ruben leaps over and catches the girl by her thin
wrist she bites hard on Rubens bare hand

Ruben screams with pain trying to pull his hand out of the
girls mouth but the girl is much stronger and she slowly
pulls him out of the train

Ruben is struggling to no avail He desperately turns his
head towards the boy seeking help The boy watches
indifferently and keeps whistling his tune

Only Rubens feet remain in the railcar but to his horror
he notices the approaching lights of a locomotive on the
opposite track Ruben screams

The next minute he dreams of climbing the steps of a huge
temple At the entrance two stone Atlases hold an even
bigger stone globe with the constellations drawn on them
Ruben is smaller than the their smallest toe and needs time
to pass by their huge feet and enter a marble hall The
stands are full and Ruben is surprised that several hundred
thousand people sit there in complete silence all watching
him

Suddenly far away he notices a raven-haired young man in a
red shirt The young man stands with his feet apart with
hands down looking straight at Ruben as he approaches Ruben
is confused he doesn’t understand what’s going on He can
make out a cowboy belt on the young man (Andy Warhol’s Elvis
I and II ) with a holstered gun Ruben stops

DOUBLE ELVIS
Oh you are just in time Ruben

Like thunder striking through the opening in the marble roof
the chanting of a hundred thousand people echoes

SPECTATORS

Ruben is confused his eyesight goes blurry and it seems to
him as if the young man has just doubled

DOUBLE ELVIS
What are you waiting for Draw

RUBEN BRANDT

DOUBLE ELVIS
(smiling)
Oh but you do And not only one

Ruben Brandt looks down and sees that hes carrying a belt
with two holsters gun handles sticking out of them

RUBEN BRANDT
But

Again a sound like thunder strikes through the marble roof

SPECTATORS
(shouting)

Gun fight Gun fight Gun fight

The entire hall spins around Rubens head Now he sees the
double figured man as three figures in a red shirt A moment
later eight identical young men stand in front of Ruben
then eleven He draws the right-hand gun but can feel
bullets from eleven guns slamming into his flash

RUBEN BRANDT

and puts the watch back to his pocket

has to shout to overcome the horrible noise of the wind

his own shoulder and moves towards the door

VAN GOGH’S POSTMAN

Kowalski and Barutanski start to fight for their lives They
accidentally push down the projector from the desk which
starts flashing Barutanski picks up his trident-knife and
throws it towards Kowalski The knife barely misses Kowalski
and gets stuck into the wall Barutanski using his secret
weapon a wire from a collar tries to strangle Kowalski

Kowalski using his last ounce of strength pushes Barutanski
back to the wall straight into the trident-knife Barutanski
slips down to the floor dead The projector stops flashing

Mike is breathing heavily and is trying to get his strength
back He collects the film rolls puts them back into their
metallic suitcase and closes the lid

But what he finds behind leaves him speechless the photo he
sees on the shelf is the same one that he has in his

Mimi opens the crane grab and the Tatra flies over it
landing hardly on the other side of highway The truck with
Mimi on board is still pulling behind the crashed crane Bye-
Bye Joe throws down a rope from the helicopter for Mimi

BYE-BYE JOE

TRUCK CRANE DRIVER
Oh That won’t be easy baby

The truck crane driver suddenly takes a sharp turn trying to
prevent Mimi from catching the rope Mimi falls off the
crane but in the last moment she manages to catch the rope

Because of the too sharp turn the heavy crane grab hits the
tank truck Both trucks lose control

into the tunnel in front of the Tatra It cuts off the
Tatra’s roof which slips in to the tunnel

The truck crane has no time to stop and it crashes straight
into the tank truck Both explode

Mimi and Bye-Bye Joe are in the helicopter on the other side
of the tunnel and are waiting for the Tatra to come out
