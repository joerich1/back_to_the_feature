MIKE (CONTD)
But People Stans a bully Why
It would be way too easy to say
Stan preys on the weak because hes
simply a dick No Stans more
complex than that According to
leading psychiatrists Stan is a
bully for 1 of 3 reasons 1 under
all that male bravado theres an
insecure little girl banging on the
closet door trying to get out 2
like a caveman Stans brain is
underdeveloped Therefore Stan is
unable to use self-control so he
acts out aggressively And the
third reason-

Mike holds up his pinky then spins the ball on it
MIKE (CONTD)
Id argue that Stan suffers from
all 3

The entire cafeteria LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY

Mike feigns whipping it back at Stan who recoils then
gently rolls the ball back to Stan
