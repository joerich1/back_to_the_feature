FADE IN

Standing in a nonexistent set is ANDY KAUFMAN looking a bit
nervous Wide-eyed tentative he stares at us with a
needy unsettling cuteness His hair is slicked-down and
he wears the FRIENDLY WORLD costume from the Andy Kaufman
special

Finally Andy speaks -- in a peculiar FOREIGN ACCENT

ANDY (AS FOREIGN MAN)

Andy puts a needle on a phonograph and swelling CLOSING
CREDITS MUSIC starts to play FINAL CREDITS roll

Andy stands frozen awkwardly looking at the audience
Every time the music ends he picks up the needle and
restarts the music He does that as many times as the
credits require

Finally CREDITS END And then--a sly smile He leans in
DROPS HIS ACCENT and WHISPERS

ANDY (AS REGULAR VOICE)
Okay Just my friends are left I
wanted to get rid of those other

people they would have laughed in
the wrong places

covers his mouth)

Andy turns to a primitive 16mm PROJECTOR and turns it on
WHIR He smiles at the flickering light

ANDY
Oh yes I remember it well

whiter whiter

In my younger and more vulnerable

people in this world havent had the
advantages youve had

Theres a little NERVOUS LAUGHTER Is he really gonna read

in a reserved way and I understood
that he meant a great deal more than
that

looks at the student He smiles

of moral attention forever I wanted
no more riotous excursions with
privileged glimpses into the human
heart

People start BOOING Andy looks up

ANDY (BRITISH) (contd)

Please lets keep it down We have

a long way to go

INT HARRAHS SHOWROOM - NIGHT

The showroom is packed It hums with curiosity WAITERS
clean off the dinner tables George rushes in and is seated
in a far booth with some STRANGERS He overhears a heated
conversation between a PUSHY MAN and his WIFE

PUSHY MAN
Youre not listenin Its a VERY
simple concept

WIFE OF PUSHY MAN

Youre making no sense How can
they be the same person --
PUSHY MAN

Trust me Youll never see them on
stage at the same time

The onstage ORCHESTRA hits a fanfare LIGHTS DIM Sharp
SPOTLIGHTS meet at the foot of the stage Suddenly -- Tony
swaggers out hands over his head in a gesture of triumph

Thunderous APPLAUSE Tony beams The music stops

George leans in curious as to how Andy will wiggle out of
this

Tony bows theatrically turns back to face the orchestra
and waits The NOISE LEVEL slowly drops -- but not
entirely Tony waits and waits and waits until
suddenly he turns towards the audience and SCREAMS
FURIOUSLY

TONY CLIFTON

Everybody looks up alarmed The general murmur almost
dies Tony stands there eyes flashing with anger at all

the unruly people As they quiet down Tony turns back to
the orchestra and raises his arms The MUSICIANS lift their
instruments Silence is total -- except for the clank of
china

Waiters are serving coffee

Tony spins back around livid
TONY CLIFTON (contd)
THAT APPLIES TO YOU TOO
PENGUINS

People signal shh The waiters realize Tonys addressing
them and they stare back in disbelief This is their job

TONY CLIFTON (contd)
Yeah Yeah YOU Im talkin to
YOU And you better freeze or
Ill get your asses fired

Tonys outburst is so commanding that they all freeze The
waiters stand there like statues staring in terror

Satisfied Tony burns back to the orchestra and raises his

arms Again the musicians lift their instruments In
anticipation of loud music the waiters start moving about
Audience members start whispering Tony hears this -- and

drops his arms and head in despair

The musicians lower their instruments Tony waits for
absolute silence Only then does he signal the musicians to
get ready again They do And then at that precise moment
-- somebody DROPS a spoon

Tony jolts as if hit by a current He drops his hands
again turns and gives the perpetrator a murderous look
Then he turns again lowers his head and waits And waits
And waits

The man at Georges table WHISPERS to his wife

PUSHY MAN
Hes never gonna start Kaufman
thinks this is funny

(beat)
Weve paid forty bucks for a show
thats never gonna start

George grins stupidly The silence is now deafening
Slowly very slowly Tony raises his arms Slowly the
musicians get their instruments ready Tony stands there
and stands and stands waiting for something anything
to disturb the silence In vain Somebody COUGHS The
whole scene repeats itself

Finally -- finally -- Tony is surrounded by total silence
Then (only a moment before the length of this scene would
become unbearable) he begins to move Tony pivots around
looks at the audience
And the entire room looks like Tussauds Wax Museum Tony
starts LAUGHING hysterically The audiences reaction is
mixed

Some people LAUGH Some BOO Some ask perplexed questions
Some SCREAM OBSCENITIES Some even APPLAUD

Tony is very happy He turns to the orchestra raises his
baton -- and commences the downbeat The MUSIC BEGINS

A SPOTLIGHT hits the wings and then ANDY STRIDES OUT
Georges jaw drops

WIFE OF PUSHY MAN
You see I told you Theyre not
the same person

The whole audience BURSTS INTO APPLAUSE Life is back to
normal Andy bows shyly and takes his place in front of a
prepared row of congas He starts to play

Tony Clifton grabs the microphone

TONY CLIFTON
Thank you Thank you I wrote this
tune for my friend Frank Sinatra
He had a nice little success with
it but forgot to thank me on the
album

He starts to BELT I Gotta Be Me
George squints his eyes trying to figure out who this is

TONY CLIFTON (contd)

Whether Im right

Or whether Im wrong

Whether I find a place in this
world

Or never belong

I gotta be me I gotta be me

What else can I be but what I am

Tonys singing is awful Andy happily accompanies on
congas The audience doesnt know what to think

Tonys SINGING reaches the end aggressive and off-key
TONY CLIFTON (contd)

Lets bring it on home --

screeching CLIMAX)

Now I get to be Tony I get to dump
the glass of water on someone elses
head

GEORGE

But whats the POINT How will any
of this make you the biggest star in
the world

Andy contemplates this

ANDY
George Im at a stage where the
audience expects me to constantly
shock them But short of faking my
death or setting the theater on
fire I dont know what else to do
(thoughtful)
Cause Ive always got to be one
step ahead of them

But I feel youre extending this
philosophy to real life Its
obsessive Nothings ever on the

And uh -- I just dont feel they
have that

The audience MURMURS uncomfortably Andy laughs and
backpedals

table are George and Lynne

Tony attacks the chorus

TONY CLIFTON (contd)
Oh no not I
I WILL SURVIVE
As long as I know how to love
I know Ill simply stay alive

In the crowd we pass face after face -- smiling
frowning intrigued confused until we settle ona
man in the very last row

Bob Zmuda
Enjoying the show more than anyone

TONY CLIFTON (contd)
Ive got all my life to live
Ive got all my life to give
I will survive

(he hits his big

finish)
I -- WILL -- SURVIVE

The music CRESCENDOS and the song ENDS
Zmuda grins and APPLAUDS proudly

FADE OUT
THE END
