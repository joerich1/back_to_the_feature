Pouring rain A middle-aged couple scuttle out of a
reasonably large Edwardian semi-detached suburban house
loading gardening equipment into the back of a large Volvo
estate car They drive off

An allotment It has stopped raining The couple are TOM
and GERRI He has a beard straggly hair and spectacles
She has long hair Both are informal and alternative in
demeanour and attire

TOM is turning over soil with a spade He stops and joins
GERRI who is planting

GERRI
Dont do your back in

TOM
I know It doesnt get any
easier Job for a younger man
this

GERRI
Joe used to love it here

TOM
Did you speak to my son and heir

GERRI
I left him a message on his
answer-phone (She plants a
plant)

TOM
Its going to rain again

More heavy rain TOM and GERRI are sitting in their nearby
shelter on the allotment sipping mugs of tea They share a
joke They look happy and contented

Clear bright weather A train passes a Land-Rover which
drives across a barren piece of wasteland by the River
Thames A motor barge on the water the cityscape in the
distance The car circles a drilling rig and stops

TOM gets out of the passenger seat wearing a hard hat a
suit and tie and a yellow safety jacket He and a young
male colleague who has been driving walk over to the rig
Two men are laying out a long metal tube on a bench

TOM (CONTD)
Alright then

WORKER
Alright boss

TOMS COLLEAGUE

WORKER

TOM
Probably

(The other WORKER joins them)

TOMS COLLEAGUE
Alright Mick

MICK

TOM

(MICK helps the first WORKER who unscrews a small section
at one end of the tube)

TOM (CONT’D)
How long will it take us to get
back
TOMS COLLEAGUE
Twenty-five with traffic Are

TOM

TOMS COLLEAGUE

FIRST WORKER

(He has removed the section He holds it out to TOM who
scrapes off a small sample of muddy clay with his fingers
He inspects it for a second)

TOM
(cheerfully) Yes London clay

TOMS COLLEAGUE
Thanks Andy - See you

ANDY
Cheers

TOM
Ta ta

(TOM and his colleague get into the car and drive off as
ANDY and MICK get on with the job)

A large industrial shed Long tables Technicians
inspecting and logging sample of clay etc TOM’S COLLEAGUE
unwraps such a sample He examines a small piece of clay
with a megnifier TOM looks on

TOMS COLLEAGUE
Dusting of mica

TOM

(TOMS COLLEAGUE passes him the sample and the magnifier)

TOMS COLLEAGUE

(TOM inspects it and laughs Warm enthusiastic)

TOM

(His COLLEAGUE is breaking off another chunk of earth TOM
points to it)

TOM (CONTD)

TOMS COLLEAGUE

The Medical Centre Another small unsympathetic room

GERRI is counselling JANET the insomniac from the first
scene

GERRI
What would you say was the
happiest moment of your life

JANET
What dyou mean

GERRI
Your nicest memory Have a think

(JANET sits in silence Miserable and expressionless GERRI
waits for a while)

GERRI (CONT’D)
When your children were born
Your wedding day

JANET
I dont know

GERRI
Take your time

JANET
I cant remember

GERRI
Cant or wont

JANET
Mm

GERRI

Cant or wont remember

JANET
Dont know what Im doing here -
I dont want to come Dont want
to talk about my family - why
should I None of your business
(MORE)
JANET (CONTD)
All I need is a good nights
sleep and nobodys helping me

GERRI
Janet I want to help you -
thats why were here I know
its not easy to talk about
personal things Suppose the boot
was on the other foot and
someone came to you - say your
daughter and said “I havent
been sleeping for months” What
would you say to them

JANET
Go to the doctor

GERRI
What else would you say

JANET
I dont know

GERRI
What would you ask her

JANET
Is she eating alright or
something like that

(GERRI looks at her for a few moments)

GERRI
Good Anything else

JANET
That all she needed was a couple
of months of proper sleep and
then that would sort it out

GERRI
Sort what out

JANET
The sleeping

GERRI
Okay (She reflects for a
moment) On a scale of one to
ten how happy would you say you
are Janet

JANET
One

GERRI
One (Slight smile) I think
theres room for improvement
there dont you What is the one
thing that would improve your
life apart from sleep

JANET
A different life

GERRI
A different life Change is
frightening isnt it

JANET
Nothing changes

(Pause )

A little later GERRI sees JANET out of the room

GERRI
I hope to see you next week
Janet Same time Ill be here
but its up to you No pressure
Bye

(JANET walks out of the room without saying anything GERRI
sighs closes the door and moves back into the room)

Later still Outside GERRI’s room She comes out with a
CLIENT who puts on his cap

GERRI (CONTD)
Bye bye Sam

SAM
Bye

(GERRI shuts her door and crosses the waiting-room )

GERRI
Look at you You look like youre
fit to burst

(She is addressing TANYA the pregnant doctor we met
earlier They walk along together GERRI gently touching
TANYAs tummy)

TANYA
I am fit to burst Big Boys
wrestling his way down

GERRI
Well if he pops out give me a
shout

TANYA
Sweetheart Ill do more than
shout

(GERRI laughs and goes into an office An attractive
middle-aged woman with her hair pinned up and wearing a low-
cut dress is sitting at a computer surrounded by piles of
files She is wearing reading glasses)

WOMAN
Hi Gerri

GERRI
Hello Mary

MARY

GERRI

(She is carrying some documents )

MARY

GERRI

MARY

spectacles) And Ive got a
headache

GERRI

(GERRI goes MARY reflects for a moment then resumes
work )

In a busy bar GERRI and MARY are seated at a table
sharing a bottle of white wine

MARY (CONTD)
D’you know Gerri Ive never
been with a man who could cook

GERRI

MARY
No Well I can a bit but its
not really my thing

GERRI
No its not

MARY

(She giggles again GERRI smiles)

GERRI
You could put an ad in the paper
“Chef wanted”

MARY
Yeah “Chef-stroke-boyfriend
required for gorgeous girl” - no
“mature woman with cat”
(Laughs) No - “matur-ish” We
dont want to put ‘em off do we

(MARY now observes a handsome middle-aged MAN in a suit
He is standing at the bar alone drinking a glass of
wine )

MARY (CONTD)
Oh its really lovely the way

GERRI

MARY (CONTD)

bottle and aims for GERRIs
glass) Can I top you up

GERRI
No Im going now Mary

MARY
Oh arent you going to help me

GERRI
No really

MARY
Oh alright Well I think Im

(She pours herself the rest of the wine and glances at the
MAN at the bar)

MARY (CONTD)
Hows Joe Have you heard from

GERRI
No But Im sure hes fine

MARY

GERRI

GERRI

MARY
Oh

Saturday

MARY

Oh lovely Thank you Gerri
Give my love to that lovely Tom

GERRI
I will You take care

MARY
Yeah

(GERRI goes MARY prepares to flirt with the MAN at the
bar who for a moment glances in her direction But almost
immediately MARYs seductive expression melts to horror
as an attractive YOUNG WOMAN with long blonde hair and a
broad smile arrives and embraces the man They kiss on the
lips and MARY looks crestfallen )

GERRI is enjoying her ample beautiful back garden She
tends to a bush takes a relaxing breath and goes into her
conservatory where she sprays a plant or two Then she
picks a leaf which she sniffs as she enters her expansive
attractive kitchen She crosses to the stove where TOM is
stirring He is wearing an apron She puts her arms round
him from behind and snuggles up

GERRI
Whats for supper

TOM
Arrabiata Are you hungry

GERRI
Im starving

(TOM stops stirring and turns to face her)

TOM
Hello

(He kisses her on the lips)

TOM (CONT’D)
Have a taste

(He holds out the wooden spoon)

GERRI
I hope its not too hot

TOM
You can never tell with chillies

(They taste the sauce in turn GERRI first)

GERRI
No

TOM

No
GERRI

Oh - its comin’ out me ears
TOM

Good Glass of wine
(GERRI is getting some plates)
GERRI
No Ive had a couple Oh go on -

TOM
Thats the spirit

(He pours some red wine GERRI sets the plates on the
table )

A few minutes later They are sitting at the table eating

GERRI
How was your day

TOM
Good I was out and about
getting my hands dirty How about

you

GERRI
Disappointing Pass me the
parsley

(He does so)

TOM
No breakthroughs

GERRI
I had my alcoholic teacher in
again

TOM
Yeah

GERRI

He was pissed as a fart

TOM
(Amused) Really

GERRI
(Smiling) It was very upsetting
actually

TOM

How did you handle it

GERRI
I bought him a double scotch
No I had to challenge him I
told him it was up to him

TOM
How did he take that

GERRI
Well I dont know Well have to
see

TOM
Well at least he came

GERRI
Hmm Have we heard from Joe

TOM
No But I havent checked my
emails

GERRI
Ill ring him later Id love to
see him

TOM

Hes alright

(GERRI reflects maternally)

An airy room on a busy main street Traffic noise outside
Twenty or so chairs arranged in a square A few people are
waiting This is a community law centre

JOE enters a young man of around thirty He is carrying a
wrapped sandwich and a can of Coke He addresses an elderly
MAN who is with a young WOMAN

JOE
Mr Gupta

(MR GUPTA and the WOMAN get up JOE shakes MR GUPTAs
hand)

JOE (CONT’D)
Joe Hepple Nice to meet you

WOMAN
I just came with him

JOE
Ah - good Just follow me this
way please

(He leads them out of the room)

JOE (CONTD)
This way

An upstairs corridor They follow him into his tiny
cluttered office

JOE (CONT’D)
Excuse the mess You sit there
Mr Gupta (He moves a chair)
And (to the WOMAN) Ill
pop you there

(He closes the door)

A little later JOE is sitting at his desk He has a letter
in his hand

JOE (CONTD)
Okay now weve opened all these
letters and Ive seen all I need
to see for the time being
Obviously its a sizeable
correspondence and
understandably Mr Gupta hasnt
exactly been in a position to
open them seeing as hes been in
hospital for the past ten weeks
But youre looking fit and
raring to go Mr Gupta

(MR GUPTA has not understood any of this and turns to his
friend)

MR GUPTA
Tieh

(The WOMAN shakes her head meaning to say not to bother
JOE picks up another document)

WOMAN
Excuse me

JOE
Mm

WOMAN

Er how long will this take

JOE
Oh not too long

WOMAN
Er it’s just I have to get
back to work

JOE
What d’you do

WOMAN
Er restaurant family
business

JOE
Oh - tasty

(She isnt amused)

JOE (CONTD)
Okay Erm its important for Mr
Gupta to understand that at this
point he is in no danger of being
evicted

(Speaking in Hindustani the WOMAN explains the situation
to a confused MR GUPTA)

JOE (CONTD)
Okay Im just going to take you
briefly through what’s going to
happen in Court Erm Ill be
representing Mr Gupta on the day
Well put the case to the judge
and (a phone rings) he will
agree to adjourn which will then
give us time to sort things out
okay So Ill just excuse me
(He answers the phone) Hello

Early on a Saturday evening MARY puffs on a cigarette
puts it out on the pavement a scuttles across a busy main
road

Inside TOM and GERRI’s front hall MARY arrives and
knocks As GERRI come to the door

GERRI
Ill get it

TOM
(elsewhere) Alright

(GERRI opens the door MARY is carrying a potted plant)

GERRI
Hello Mary

MARY

MARY

(She pulls a bottle of wine out of her bag and gives it to
TOM )

minute

(She hurries upstairs GERRI repeats MARYs shooting-
herself-in-the-head gesture Amused TOM and GERRI go into
the kitchen)

A bit later in the kitchen TOM is chopping vegetables at
the table GERRI is preparing salad MARY has a glass of
white wine

MARY (CONTD)

TOM

MARY

MARY

(TOM looks at her)

MARY (CONTD)
No I wasnt sure what to wear I

(TOM moves to the sink next to MARY)
TOM
I think you’ve got it just about

MARY
Oh thank you Gerri (She yawns)
Oh sorry

GERRI

MARY

GERRI
We stayed in

MARY

GERRI
We listened to some music

MARY
Oh

TOM

(A slightly chilly reaction to this from MARY)

MARY
I thought Joe might be coming

TOM
I dont think so

(TOM collects the chopping board from the table)

GERRI
Hes coming tomorrow

MARY
Oh thats a shame I wont see

TOM
Yes

MARY
What d’you think

TOM

MARY

GERRI

Well have to fatten you up

MARY
Oh its lovely having your

anyway

TOM
Youre looking well

MARY
Oh thank you Tom

GERRI
Youre nice and slim

MARY
Am I Well Ive always been
slim havent I

GERRI
Unlike me Middle-aged spread
(She pinches her “spare tyre”)

TOM
Shut up Youre perfect -
gorgeous in every way (He kisses
her on the cheek) And you know
it

(Pause TOM makes salad dressing GERRI smiles at MARY who
is looking a little bleak She manages a half-smile and
finishes her wine)

GERRI
Sit yourself down Mary Help
yourself to another drink

(MARY sits at the table GERRI squeezes TOMs arm)

GERRI (CONTD)
How’s that dressing coming along

TOM
As well as can be expected

(TOM gets on with it GERRI stirs a pot on the stove MARY
pours herself another drink and continues to look bleak)

Later in the living room Dark outside GERRI and MARY are
sitting side by side on the sofa TOM is sitting ion a
armchair facing them All have glasses of wine on the go
but only MARY is fairly drunk

MARY
I hear youre going to the
Emerald Isle again Tom

TOM
Thats correct Rent a cottage
take the car

GERRI
Put the tent in the back

TOM
And the sleeping-bags If the
weathers nice we might do a bit
of camping

MARY
Oh no I wouldnt fancy sleeping
in a tent thank you very much

TOM
No I never had you down as one
of natures Girl Guides Mary

MARY
No Tom But I am always
prepared (Laughs)

GERRI
Yes but what for

MARY
For anything Gerri You know me
(Laughs)

GERRI

(Chuckling) Yes I do

MARY
Im not going to get a holiday
this year But then I never do
do I Gerri Because I havent
got anyone to go with Its
alright for you two - youve got
each other

GERRI
Were going to the Ring of Kerry
MARY
The what

TOM
The Ring of Kerry Its an area

GERRI
Tralee Dingle Bay

MARY
Oh lovely - youve been there
before havent you

GERRI
That was Donegal

MARY
Oh

TOM
The geologist stands on the beach
with his back to the sea and
looks at the cliffs

GERRI
Whilst the geologists wife
stands on the beach with her back
to the cliffs looking at the
sea

(MARY ponders this hazily then - )

MARY
You see I cant afford to buy my
car and have a holiday But if I
had more money then I could do
both

TOM
But when youve got your car
Mary youll be able to go
wherever you want very
reasonably

MARY
Exactly Tom Thats exactly why
Im getting it You see I like
just taking off and escaping
dont I Gerri

GERRI
Mm

MARY
I feel like Im being somebody
else

TOM
Really Whos that then

GERRI
Tom

(TOM grins GERRI cant conceal a smile)

MARY
I like to get on the train But
you see the car is cheaper than
the train isnt it

GERRI
Not environmentally

MARY
Oh what You mean (she stamps
her feet) Those are my carbon
footprints Gerri (Giggles )

GERRI
Yes I know

(MARY laughs uproariously)

TOM
Financially cars are cheaper
Thats why theres no incentive
to go by train

GERRI
What about the airlines

TOM
No government wants to increase
the duty on aviation fuel

MARY
(vaguely) No

TOM
And this government wont invest
in the railways so anything we
do is a piss in the ocean

MARY
Absolutely

GERRI
And then theres the big
corporations who keep their
lights on all night in empty
office blocks
TOM
And were all expected to do our
bit with eco-bulbs

MARY
I know Should I stop recycling
then Gerri

GERRI
No
TOM
Youve got to set an example
MARY
Yeah
GERRI

Plant a few tomatoes

TOM
Or courgettes

(GERRI laughs quietly)

MARY
I am very environmentally
friendly actually

TOM
Are you

MARY
Yeah I dont fly I dont live
in a house thats more than I
need I dont cook

TOM
Other people cook for you
though

MARY
Who

TOM
You get take-aways dont you

MARY
That doesnt count Everybody
gets take-aways Youve built
whole motorways Tom How
environmentally friendly is that

TOM
Exactly

MARY
Yes Cars more cars more
cars At least Im buying an

old car

GERRI
Recycled

MARY
Yeah

TOM

Yet were constantly told that
the measure of a thriving economy
is the sale of new cars

MARY
Yes but Tom If I buy a new
car thats another car
TOM
Youre absolutely right Mary
And would you like some coffee
(MARY blinks vaguely Then - )

MARY
No thank you

GERRI
Id like my usual

In the kitchen TOM stirs the coffee in the cafetiere and
waits for it to brew

Meanwhile in the living-room MARY strokes GERRI’s arm

MARY
Are you alright Gerri

GERRI
Yes Mary Im fine How are you

(MARY reflects exuding drink and sadness Then - )

MARY
Im happy

GERRI
Good

MARY
I just wanted to say that if you
ever need to share anything Im
here for you Im a very good
listener

GERRI

(Pause Then MARY throws her arms tightly around GERRI
who is a little taken aback though she doesnt show it to
MARY )

GERRI

(Staying in the clinch MARY turns her head so that she
and GERRI are now cheek-to-cheek )

MARY
Oh Gerri Everybody needs

(MARY breaks the embrace)

MARY

Upstairs on the landing GERRI comes out of the bathroom
holding a towel and a new toothbrush

GERRI
Ive found you a toothbrush

(MARY is sitting on the stairs)
MARY
I sometimes wonder what hes

doing if he thinks about me - I
bet he does

GERRI
How old was he

MARY
Hell be sixty-four now

(TOM is at the top of the stairs)

TOM
Sixty-four Blimey hes older

GERRI

TOM

MARY
Oh no Tom he was lovely

(MARY leans unsteadily on the bannister rail She lowers
her voice)

MARY
Oh no but he was very very
sexy Gerri - dyou know what I
mean

TOM

Too much information

(This amuses GERRI)

MARY
I bet he regrets it deep down I
hope he does (She leans in a
doorway) He was my big love But

he was married
(MORE )

MARY (CONTD)

Well what can you do Tom You
cant walk around with a label
saying “Dont fall in love with
me Im married” can you

(She has now staggered to TOM at the bathroom door)

TOM
Some people wear a ring (He
displays his)

MARY
He didnt But he wasnt a bad
person He loved me

TOM
Sounds to me like he was a
duplicitous shit

GERRI
Tom

(TOM and GERRI exchange a look)

MARY
D’you think it was my fault Tom

TOM
No I dont Mary Honest

GERRI
It takes two to tango

(MARY staggers back to GERRI and holds her hands TOM
raises his eyebrows and closes the bathroom door behind
him)

MARY
Oh so you think it was my fault
Gerri

GERRI

I didnt say that

MARY
No I know you didnt really

(Now she leans on the doorway of JOEs bedroom )

MARY (CONTD)
I blame my big heart

GERRI
Well we all have to make
choices dont we

MARY
Why do I always get it wrong
Gerri I mean look what happened
when I got divorced from that
shit I let him palm me off with
five thousand nothing pounds And
what am I left with now Sod all
Im living in a poky rented flat
when I should have my own home at
my age Its not fair

(She is fraught She turns around staggers into the room
and collapses onto the bed face down)

MARY (CONTD)
Bastard

(GERRI proceeds to put her to bed)

A little later TOM and GERRI are sitting up in bed
reading books Pause GERRI closes her book and takes off

her spectacles

GERRI
My goodness

TOM
Mm

GERRI

TOM

(GERRI puts away her book and spectacles and turns off her
bedside light)

GERRI

(GERRI lies down next to TOM He puts his arm around her)

GERRI
No Youre right
TOM

History at school

TOM (CONT’D)

the more relevant it seems (He
puts his book and spectacles
away) To state the bleedin’
obvious

(GERRI laughs )

FADE TO BLACK

Title ‘SUMMER’

A bright sunny day In a train An overweight slightly
dishevelled middle-aged man staggers down the carriage
carrying two cans of lager an a bag of potato crisps His
attention is caught briefly by a young woman who passes
him going the other way Arriving at his window seat he is
obliged to disturb a grumpy middle-aged woman

He is KEN

KEN
Sorry love Excuse me

(The woman gets up for him and he sits down Debris from
previous food and beer is on the table He opens a beer
and takes a swig Then he starts on the crisps)

TOM and GERRI’s front door from the inside KEN’s figure
appears through the frosted glass He knocks vigorously
TOM sprints out of the kitchen followed by GERRI

In her bedroom GERRI looks in the mirror and combs her

sways gently on JOE’s old swing while KEN who has sobered
up a bit sits near him smoking a cigarette

TOM (CONTD)
What’re we going to do with you

(Pause )

The next morning A bright Summer’s day Blue sky Static
clouds An electric pylon on the distant horizon

GERRI strolls contentedly through the allotments She
carries a large basket She arrives at her plot and stops
She closes her eyes enjoying the sun and the gentle breeze
on her face

Meanwhile four men pull their caddies across a golf course
- JOE TOM’s friend JACK (a genial middle-aged fellow)
TOM and KEN Tall residential tower blocks in the distance

JACK
So is it every man for himself
or are we having teams

JOE
Teams

TOM

suggest that the best plays with
the worst Jack

JOE
Good idea

TOM
In other words youre with Ken

JACK
Thanks Its me and you Ken Is

Bottle of wine

JACK

Now under an expansive sky they have parked their caddies
at the first tee They prepare to play Jack holds up a
coin
JACK (CONTD)

JACK

JOE

JACK
Theres wine on it

TOM

(He prepares to tee off He has a practice swing They all
watch him Suddenly just as he is about to hit the ball
KEN does a very loud mock sneeze putting his handkerchief
to his nose He roars with laughter and runs off TOM drops
his club and runs after him mock-hitting him as he goes)

TOM (CONTD)
I knew it I knew you were going
to do that All my life Ive had
to put up with this nonsense from
you and Im not going to have it
any longer

(They disappear over the horizon JACK takes a shot
instead )

A bit later KEN is urinating behind a bush

JOE
Dont scare the wildlife Ken
TOM
How many times a night do you go
KEN
(emerging) I lose count
JACK
Youve got to get it sorted out
Ken
TOM

(KEN joins the others who are playing at the base of an
enormous electricity pylon JACK tees off)

JACK
Oh What a beauty
TOM

JACK
(To KEN) Good shot partner
KEN
Oh yeah - sorry Good shot
Jack
JACK
Thank you

(TOM puts his arm round KEN)

TOM

KEN

(JOE prepares his ball)

Later Three long shadows on the putting green - JOE’s
TOM’s and JACK’s We only see their feet

JACK
You want it out Joe

JOE
Yep

(JACK takes the flag out of the hole)

TOM
Good luck partner

JOE
Its all down to this

(He putts the ball It proceeds directly towards the
hole)

JOE (CONT’D)
Looks good

(The ball drops into the hole They all roar with delight
We see the shadow of TOM shaking JOEs hand)

Now a small old red car drives erratically down TOM and
GERRI’s street MARY is at the wheel She parks clumsily
half on the kerb She gets out with her bag and a bottle
of wine She runs to TOM and GERRI’s front door She
knocks but gets no reply She is agitated She adjusts her
hair and her knickers Then she suddenly realises
something and rushes through the side entrance and into
the back garden

MARY
Gerri Tom

TOM
Ha Here she is

GERRI
Hello Mary

(Grouped round a garden table near a barbecue are TOM
GERRI KEN JACK and TANYA GERRI is holding TANYAs baby

bottle)

MARY
Oh here comes Ken

quickly)

(KEN ambles towards TANYA )

MARY
He could be quite good looking if

(KEN and TANYA chat We see all this from a distance ie
from GERRIs and MARYs point of view)

MARY (CONTD)
He should lose a couple of stone

GERRI
He was a good looking man when he
was young

MARY

(They watch him Then GERRI turns to MARY)

GERRI (CONTD)
Lifes not always kind is it

MARY
No it isnt Gerri

(She reflects on this for a few moments KEN and TANYA
chat)

MARY (CONTD)
I dont mind the grey hair I
think that can look quite
distinguished on a man of his
age but (she shudders)
you know

(GERRI looks at MARY for a moment then looks away MARY is
unsure as to GERRIs thoughts She reflects again)

In front of the house JACK leaves TOM stands on his
doorstep his hands in his pockets He is still wearing his

apron

(He goes

TOM

TOM glances up and down the street then goes

inside closing the door A dog barks in the distance)

on the steps of a wooden cabin at the far end She still
has her wine glass

cabin )

MARY (CONTD)

barn door)

MARY (CONTD)

MARY
Oh but Yeah you wanna be

careful Joe because

twenties and granted he was the
wrong man but I was too young -
I couldnt handle it

(MORE

MARY (CONTD)
But when I was in my thirties I
met the right man and I was
mature I was ready for it
(Pause) I mean he left me
but what can you do

JOE
Its never too late Mary

MARY
Oh no I know it isnt Joe
and you know me - Im very much a
glass-half-full kind of girl But
its tricky because I meet
these older men who want somebody
younger and thats great
because I fit the bill But
when they find out that you
know Im not as young as they
thought they dont want to know
My looks work against me How old
do you think I look Joe

JOE
Sixty Seventy

(A brief moment of horror then she realises)

MARY
Oh stop it

(They laugh But the laughter fades away Pause)

MARY (CONTD)
Oh its alright - you dont have
to answer that So when are we
going to have this drink then

JOE
Oh I dont know - Ill have to
check my diary

MARY
Yeah you do that Give me a
call
JOE
I will
MARY
Promise
JOE

I promise

(Pause JOE looks away In these few moment we see in
MARYs face a multitude of painful thoughts and emotions)

KEN is standing in the kitchen by the hall door He is
holding a glass of red wine and the bottle TOM comes in

Everyone who lives and believes
in me will never die I am
convinced that neither death nor

creation will be able to separate
us from the love of God in Christ
Jesus Our Lord”

To Him be glory forever Amen
