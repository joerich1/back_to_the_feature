tension with a joke

CAMPAIGN SPEECH to a crowd of stone faced UNION BOYS

HARVEY MILK

I know I know Im not what you

were expecting but I left my high
heels at home

Harvey gets a LAUGH from the AUDIENCE

5 INT HARVEYS KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
RETURN TO Harvey speaking into his tape recorder

HARVEY MILK

I fully realize that a person who
stands for what I stand for - an
activist a gay activist - becomes
the target or potential target for
a person who is insecure
terrified afraid or very disturbed
themselves

6 INT CITY HALL OFFICES - MONTAGE - DAY

POLICE OFFICERS AND PRESS RACE THROUGH THE HALLS of City

Hall their walkie-talkies squawking Something terrible has

11 INT HARVEYS KITCHEN - RECORDED WILL - NIGHT
RETURN TO Harvey speaking into his tape recorder

HARVEY MILK

Knowing that I could be assassinated
at any moment I feel its important
that some people should understand
my thoughts I think that--

(pauses not sure what to say)

I wish I had time to explain
everything I did Almost everything
that was done was done with an eye
on the gay movement

institution I was very discreet
But someone spotted me at the
opera sitting in a box next to my
lover And I was fired Thats

when I decided to do something So
I bought The Advocate And I use

my money and my influence in quiet
ways to do what I can

HARVEY MILK
Endorsing straight candidates is
what you think is best to help us

DAVID GOODSTEIN
Yes if theyre friendly to our
cause

RICK STOKES

(DEFENSIVE)

Politics is complicated in San
Francisco and Supervisor is a
citywide office Political alliances
need to be built You cant simply
move here from across the country
and run for office

HARVEY MILK
But I am running for office Im on
the ballot I have the union rank
and file the seniors and I could
use your magazines endorsement

DAVID GOODSTEIN

Harvey were like the Catholic
church We welcome converts but we
dont make them Pope the same day

HARVEY MILK
And why havent you run

DAVID GOODSTEIN

Its too early for a gay candidate

for Supervisor Especially one

from the Castro Its bad for the

communitys image

Scott climbs out of the pool and sits at the table naked
and

sopping wet

SCOTT SMITH
Whats wrong with the Castro

DAVID GOODSTEIN

Nobody works there Its all sex
and drugs and more sex and no one
taking responsibility for their own
problems

HARVEY MILK

The cops come into our neighborhood
and beat us They turn a blind eye
if one of us is murdered

RICK STOKES

Then we file a lawsuit against the
city We go to our political allies
in City Hall

HARVEY MILK
There are no real gay allies Yes
our friends may sense our struggle
but they cant feel it Its not
life or death for them We need our
own in office

RICK STOKES
You cant demand acceptance overnight

HARVEY MILK

Why not How can we ask them to
respect us if we dont show
ourselves some self respect David

DAVID GOODSTEIN

The more A€eouta€lL) you make us the
more you incite them Step back and
quiet down

HARVEY MILK

Go back into the closet Is that
what youre saying Because I know
the closet I lived in it for more
years than I care to remember
(rising to go)

I dont need your endorsement Im
not asking anyone for acceptance
I dont have time to ask

DAVID GOODSTEIN

For you politics is a game a
lark Like putting on a rock
festival or staging a love-in
Youre too old to be a hippie
Harvey Milk

Harvey turns around ready for a fight

HARVEY MILK

Im not a candidate Im part of a
movement The movement is the
candidate Theres a difference You
dont see the difference But I do

SCOTT SMITH

Thanks for the swim Im sorry I
pissed in your pool

ART AGNOS

Art smiles Chuckles flutter through the audience

HARVEY MILK

Youre right Art And many are
your closest friends You see I
dont think State Assembly seats
should be awarded on the basis of
service to the Democrat Machine
Machines operate on oil and grease
Theyre dirty dehumanizing and
too often unresponsive to any needs
but those of the operator

ART AGNOS

Mr Milk Ive worked for years as
a social worker in this city I

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT - (ON TV) 115

Harvey sits with John Briggs at a table facing forward

hear the cheers and jeers of the packed audience

HARVEY MILK

Senator as a Christian its
interesting that you dont seem to
understand what Christ was about
He was about accepting people and
giving love not carrying a Bible
in one hand and hatred in the
other

(cheers from the audience)

-Now all the gay myths have been
shattered all the fears all the--

JOHN BRIGGS
Not in my mind they havent--

HARVEY MILK
Thats it In your mind they
havent and Im wondering why--

JOHN BRIGGS

Mr Milk we dont allow people who
believe in practicing bestiality to
teach our children and the reason
we dont is because it is illegal
But its not illegal to be a
homosexual in California

HARVEY MILK

And your law goes even further Any
school employee who even supports a
gay person will be fired--

JOHN BRIGGS

True But gay people dont have
children of their own If they
dont recruit our children theyd
all die away Thats why they want
to be teachers to encourage our
children to join them

HARVEY MILK (ON TV)

How do you teach homosexuality
Like French I was born of
heterosexual parents I was taught
by heterosexual teachers ina

We
fiercely heterosexual society So
then why am I homosexual And no
offense meant but if it were true
that children mimicked their

Continuing on with his recorded will

HARVEY MILK

We were really genuinely frightened
by Proposition Six and with the
backlash gaining strength we were
very pessimistic We didnt think

organize to the point that when we
did lose there would be a
revolt That all hell would break

BRIGGSS SUPPORTERS jeer Harvey as he rips into their State
Senator Their vehemence frightens Dick in the audience
Harvey lifts a Briggs flier

HARVEY MILK

If in your statements here you say
that child molestation is not an
issue why do you put out literature
that hammers it home why do you play
on that myth and fear

JOHN BRIGGS

Same thing with VD Harvey we put
out publications about VD so you
can avoid it

HARVEY MILK

(with a grin)

But youve even admitted that
theres more molestation in the
heterosexual group So why not get
rid of the heterosexual teachers
Boos from the conservative audience

JOHN BRIGGS

We are not talking about homos
child molestation the fact is at
least 95 percent of the people are
heterosexual If we took
heterosexuals out AND homosexuals
out you know what--

JOHN BRIGGS (CONTD) HARVEY MILK
--wed have no teachers Wed have no teachers--

HARVEY MILK
--No child molestation So youre
saying the percentage of population
is equal to the percentage of child
molestation

JOHN BRIGGS

(getting more lost)
No no Im not saying that at all--

and

HARVEY MILK
Thats what you just said

JOHN BRIGGS

No Im saying that we cannot

prevent child molestation so lets

cut our odds down and take out the

homosexual group and keep in the

heterosexual group--

Harvey laughs in disbelief at the asinine argument Briggs
looks down to his notes lost Harvey takes the opportunity
to rip into the State Senator

HARVEY MILK

(directly to Briggs)

--Sir in your own drive for

personal power how many careers

are you willing to see destroyed

How many lives will you destroy in

your lust for power and when will

you stop
