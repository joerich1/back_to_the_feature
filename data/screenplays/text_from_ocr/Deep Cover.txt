kids
CARVER

Youre separated from your wife

your kids every other weekend

Stevens takes a breath this is awkward to explain

STEVENS
(almost a confession)
All my life Ive stayed away from
that stuff Ive never touched drugs

CARVER
(tolerant)
Come on a little grass
STEVENS

Not grass Not nothing I never even
had a drink

(his motto)
Never have never will You dont
understand I made a choice in my
life

CARVER

Whats to understand You saw your
father killed when you were ten and
you decided you wouldnt be like
that

(off Stevens surprise

Carver grins)
Im God I know everything You wanted
to be a good boy so you became a
cop Hiding out in uniform Thats
why you got the hard-on for Taft

STEVENS
Its not that simple

CARVER
(opening Joes file
as if reluctantly)
Tll tell the truth Joe Youre
never going to be a Taft

STEVENS

You ever take a look at your
psychological profile You score

CARVER
Exaggerated moral standards but
with no underlying value system
Look at the anger the repressed
violence its almost off the scale

STEVENS
Let me see that

Carver hands him the scores which are of course just

clusters of numbers Stevens is upset though oddly

unsurprised as if this only confirmed his secret
fears

CARVER
Whyd you join the force

STEVENS
(awkward but felt)
I wanted to be of use

CARVER
Well now you can be You wont be
Taft but maybe youll be something
more interesting

(sits back)
Theres a man named Ramon Gallegos
who supplies 60 of the cocaine to
the West Coast Hes smart smooth
and sufficiently elusive that we
dont even have an adult photograph
of him However his uncle is Hector
Guzman an important Latin American
political figure Gallegos uses
Uncles connections to get product
into the country and everyone weve
sent after him has ended up like
that

Indicates dead body on TV

STEVENS
Why would I be different

CARVER

You already are thats the point

(indicates file test

scores)
Youve got the ability and the
personality to go underground and
blend in completely Thats what the
others couldnt Some part of them
showed Thats why theyre dead
See theres only one rule in this
game

Stevens raises his eyebrows what

CARVER

of that moment of perfect chemistry) but she avoids his

test
scores
HULL
So hows this place work
Betty doesnt answer so Elias covers the awkwardness
ELIAS
Betty wires the money to a store in
Aruba in payment for things they
never sent her They deposit the
money in a bank there that turns
around and loans her money she never
has to repay That way it doesnt
turn up as income for the IRS Welcome
to the laundromat

MCCUTCHEON
(offering him the
straw)
Come on Eddie 2 youre up
refusal
first

a

more
violence

the

attractive

seems

hates

She and

HULL
No thanks

NOTE Betty is acutely attuned to Hull and in his

she senses -- albeit unconsciously -- two things

that he doesnt trust himself on drugs therefore hes
dangerous guy and therefore exciting and second
important the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the
and danger and thus a longing for goodness Despite
seeming contradiction she finds this even more

But because she feels herself to be bad his goodness
only a judgment against her and so she thinks she

him

MCCUTCHEON
Who is he my mother

HULL
(smiles)
Never have never will

Betty ignores him does her lines

MCCUTCHEON
(taunting Hull)
Oooh Cocaine I love it and I
hate it and I love it The disease
is the cure

She cant help looking at Hull whos looking at her
Elias are stoned hes not

(continuing)
Or we lose all authority with the
other dealers And one of them11

Hull looks up startled

ELIAS
(continuing)

Hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods

ELIAS
(continuing)
And if we kill Ivy we control this
whole territory

HULL

ELIAS
No If we use Chino its Barbosa

GRAINY 16MM FILM - A LABORATORY MAZE
A lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its
head
is running a maze at high speed A VOICE explaining
things
VOICE
(young nasal too
smart)
The maze leads in two directions At
one end the rat can obtain a food
pellet At the other
(pointer indicates
each end)
it receives electrical stimulus
to a very specific area of the
cerebellum
The rat reaches this second destination pushes a bar
is
stimulated A lab worker (white coat gloves) picks up
the
animal replaces it at the start It runs the same
route
VOICE
(continuing)
This rat like 86 of the others in
the experiment chose the electrical
stimulus repeatedly and exclusively
It continued to do so until it died
of malnutrition
ANOTHER SHOT -- the rat dead
INT A LABORATORY - DAY OR NIGHT
A 21-year-old RENEGADE from the Cal Tech chemistry
department
(red hair freckles glasses held together with
electrical

tape) a brilliant nerd He picks up
A MOLECULAR MODEL
Colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels

CAL TECH
This is an addictive amphetamine
with time-space distortion delusions
of grandeur -- or maybe theyre real --
tending to be impulsive sometimes
violent behavior Psychotropic
adaptation for late monopoly
capitalism Its illegal and you
can buy it on any street corner

He tears off some of the balls sticks on new ones

CAL TECH

(continuing)
This increases energy attention
cognitive powers yet with a smooth
almost opiate-like emotional surface
Ideal for the post-political post-
rationalist global marketplace and
24 hour lifestyles Its completely
legal and can only get it here in
my lab

ELIAS
(to Hull proudly)
Randys a genius His professor told
him he could win the Nobel prize

CAL TECH
Nobel prizes are for wussies

What does this shit do to you

CAL TECH
Im on it now Its like cocaine
only better

HULL
I dont take drugs

CAL TECH
(unoffended)
Your mistake This is designed for
the top end of the market For people
Ivys
board

lost in

his

who want to master reality not avoid
it Because its synthetic you dont

grow it refine it or -- best of
all -- import it
ELIAS

What would it take to manufacture
this stuff in quantity

CAL TECH

With a million dollars I could
produce enough for a limited market
at about two bucks a pop

(makes a face fair)
But then with five million or better
yet ten the cost would drop to thirty
cents and wed have enough for the
whole world

ELIAS

Im going to put two hundred fifty
thousand into your corporate account
You cheat me Randy Ill use your
bladder for a bagpipe

(to Hull with a

vengeance)
Were going to put Barbosa out of
business
