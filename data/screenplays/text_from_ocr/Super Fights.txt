TIGHT ON HAND

It PULLS away from the CAMERA

INT WAREHOUSE — DAY

An old Chinese man GRANDFATHER going through a beautiful Tai Zhi
Quan form It is very peaceful and graceful The form ends with a
palm strike towards camera blacking out the frame (for possible
INTERCUT use)

INT SUPERFIGHT ARENA — NIGHT

Spotlights cut through the murky darkness while rock music PULSES
The sound of the crowd barely visible in the darkness is a
RUMBLE in the dark not unlike the sound of an enraged animal

They are yelling for blood

QUICK CUTS of other fighters in the ring including Punks Sumo
wrestlers Kickboxers Shootfighters and others Its a
spectacle and we see bits and snippets of it all — the knockout
blows the colorful fighters the incredible techniques the
bloodshed the brutality DARKCLOUD and NIGHT STALKER face off in
the ring (ONE FIGHT)

Darkcloud is slamming Night Stalker in the head over and over
With the second blow the mans mouthpiece goes flying into the
crowd Soon the blood starts to spray but the man doesnt stop
hitting

In the front row right next to the ring is JACK CODY an 18 year
old dreamer Drinking it all in he is yelling his lungs out for
the fighters

A WOMAN standing next to Jack cringes at the brutality and covers
her eyes

WOMAN
How can you watch this

JACK
Its great isnt it I love it

The woman looks at Jack uncomprehendingly then shakes her head
and steps over him to get out then walks up the stairs to the
exit

Though the woman is very beautiful Jack doesnt even watch her
go He is too intent on the action in the ring

Now one of the women fighters ANGEL dressed in a sexy outfit
that shows off her body but also displays her finely defined
muscles is fighting another SuperFighter She is brutalizing the
other fighter yet both are covered in blood
The towel has now been thrown in but Angel STILL doesnt stop
Angel has her opponent by the throat and is motioning to the
crowd thumbs up or thumbs down

NO MERCY cries the crowd and Jack is yelling louder than
anyone

JACK
Take it to her Angel Yeah

Angel spins and hook kicks her opponent in the head then spins
the other way and side kicks her into the ropes The other fighter
FLIES off the ropes and lands face down in the center of the ring

Its brutal and barbaric
And Jack loves every minute of it

A spotlight lights up the stage and two bizarre FIGHTERS stand in
the middle facing each other

ANNOUNCER
In the red corner Budokai

BUDOKAI is dressed in a gold lame uniform his belt black His
face is painted like a kabuki actor a mixture of black and white
and gold and his outfit emphasizes his massive muscles

ANNOUNCER (0S)
And in the blue corner the Enforcer

THE ENFORCER dressed like a street punk with chains and leather
spikes and chrome comes into the ring He is the bad guy here
and everyone knows it He raises his muscled arms over his head
and smiles at the crowd then brings them down into a fighting
stance

ANNOUNCER (0S)
SuperFight

The two fighters face off in fighting positions The rock music
increases its BEAT and the fighters rush each other the ring

echoing with the fury of their techniques Budokai is a martial
artist while the Enforcer is a thug But a well trained thug

nonetheless

Using a mixture of professional wrestling boxing and street
fighting the Enforcer HAMMERS Budokai in a beautifully
choreographed fight

Budokai beaten the Enforcer stands before the crowd seemingly
asking them for a decision

The crowd ROARS

ANNOUNCER
Whatll it be Mercy

The crowd YELLS out NO MERCY Everyone except Jack that is who
likes Budokai after all
The Enforcer listens to what they want then smiles and launches a
huge roundhouse right Budokai goes sailing out of the ring

Jack sees this and runs to where Budokai is going to land
thinking to break his fall

He does sort of but Budokai still lands HARD They stand up
together both a little stunned The Enforcer is now out of the
ring and coming towards Budokai and Jack is caught in the middle

Jack in the heat of the moment turns to face off with the
Enforcer He throws a couple of kicks and punches which have no
effect — except to further enrage the Enforcer

The Enforcer goes crazy and attacks Jack Budokai grabs Jack and
throws him up into the sky and then knocks the Enforcer out and
Jack lands on top of the Enforcer (like a pin in wrestling)
counting him out

The ref comes out of the ring and holds up Budokais hand and
Budokai reaches down and pulls Jack up to a standing position
holding his hand up

BUDOKAI
NO MERCY EVER

Budokai looks at Jack who is beaming with pride as the crowd
goes crazy Budokai winks at Jack

BUDOKAI
Thanks man Couldnt have done it without
you

Jack is in heaven

EXT LOADING DOCK — DAWN

A loading dock is closed up shut down tight The streets around
it are almost empty A JOGGER runs by in front getting a workout
in before a busy day starts

INT LOADING DOCK — SAME DAY

In the loading dock we MOVE THROUGH the assembled goods boxes
and various things In the bg can be heard the sound of labored
breathing and solid THUNKS and THWOCKS

We MOVE through a door that is ajar into an area of the warehouse
separate from the storage area On the walls are posters from
SuperFights martial arts training posters pictures of Bruce
Lee Chuck Norris Jean Claude Van Damme (from No Retreat No
Surrender) movie posters professional wrestlers etc

Pictures of a fighter named MIKE ROCCO are featured prominently
Rocco in the pictures is wearing a special necklace (Open
Hand) There is a magazine with his picture on it and the legend
reads Rocco Where is he now There is also a picture of Rocco
with his arm around a young fighter — a younger Jack
We see a SHADOW of what looks like two people fighting over the
picture of Rocco

The sounds of violent training are closer more immediate

A counter is piled high with training books and a TVVCR
combination sits next to them a pile of martial arts training
videos sitting on top A tape is in the machine and it is paused
on one particular instructor Mike Rocco demonstrating a
technique

Standing next to the counter are mannequins in various positions
all dressed in sporting goods equipment — at first they look like
real fighters We see Jack moving among them doing flips (with
the aid of an unseen trampoline)

Some of the mannequins are wearing protective equipment others
swimsuits still others in martial arts uniforms

Smoothly we TURN AROUND to see Jack in a muscle shirt and
workout pants working on a mannequin and we realize that they
are just mannequins not real people He is very athletic and has
obviously been training for some time He is not a master but he
is strong and effective with a great

deal of raw talent When he hits and kicks the heavy bag hanging
in the middle of the room it SHAKES the entire room

Jack is wearing the special necklace that Rocco had on in the
pictures

After one particularly grueling combination Jack stops drinks
from a sport bottle nearby He then grabs the TV remote and pushes
a button

ANGLE ON TV

The tape continues the instructor (Mike Rocco) moving on to
another combination

Jack watches it carefully then rewinds it and plays it again He
then presses pause and puts the remote back He starts hitting
the heavy bag again mimicking the combination the instructor
showed on the tape

As he is working this combination an alarm on his watch goes off
and Jack stops He gathers himself for a moment then bows to the
mannequin

JACK
Time for the SuperFight

He moves to the area of the room where the mannequins are set up
He moves into the middle of them then raises his arms like
Budokai did last night

He goes into action throwing kicks and punches at the mannequins
breaking them into pieces throwing them into all the corners of
the room
When he is done he stands panting in the center of the mess then
raises his arms again One mannequin is still standing

JACK
No mercy

He jumps off the trampoline (we see it now) and drives a spinning
wheel kick at the lone mannequin and hits it but sends himself
sprawling at the same time

The fantasy is disrupted by reality Jack smiles and puts his head
in his hands resting

FRANKIE
Cody That you

Jack doesnt answer right away

FRANKIE (0S)
Yo Jean Claude Van Dunce You there

JACK
Yeah Frankie Just finishing up

FRANKIE comes into view

FRANKIE
Man are you wasting your time with this
stuff again Hey dont leave a mess
again OK Hurry up we gotta get these
orders out

JACK
(cheerfully)
OK Ill be right down

Jack gets off the ground and starts to clean up the pieces of
mannequin around the room He assembles the mannequins again for
his next workout then pauses at the SuperFights and Mike
Rocco posters

JACK
Someday

The CAMERA PULLS OUT past the tapes books and posters

EXT JACK HOUSE — EVENING

Establishing shot of a run down tract house in a poor white
trash suburb of the city The house is much cleaner than the
others in the area Obviously some care has been taken with the
house

Jacks battered Jeep pulls up to the house and he gets out He
pauses for a moment in the front yard then shakes his head picks
up some trash from the neighbors yard and moves inside
INT JACK HOUSE — SAME NIGHT

Jack walks into the house weary from a long day of work and
hangs up his jacket

JACK
Mom Im home

MOTHER
What No UltraFights tonight

JACK
(smiling wearily)
Its SuperFights and they were last
night

MOTHER
What time did you get home

JACK

what difference does it make Mom

Jacks MOTHER comes around the corner and confronts Jack This
a road theyve been over many times but that wont stop his
Mother from trying to make a point

MOTHER
What about you I think its hurting you

JACK
Im not in the ring yet When Im one
of the fighters then you can worry OK

MOTHER
You wont be one of them Jack not while

JACK

MOTHER

JACK

MOTHER

JACK

MOTHER

Jack doesnt stop walking as he grabs his jacket and then goes
out the door He can be seen walking to his Jeep through the
ripped and patched screen door

MOTHER
You come right back here John Jacob Cody
This minute

Jack is gone and his Mother stands there for a moment waiting
The Jeep STARTS UP OS and we see the headlights FLARE on
Jacks Mothers face

MOTHER
(to herself)
Over my dead body

FADE OUT

EXT CITY BANK — SAME NIGHT

A deserted parking lot of a city bank A young very attractive
Chinese woman SALLY WONG walks to the Cash machine outside the
bank on her way home from work

She looks around to make sure no one else is there then proceeds
to the machine She puts in her card presses several buttons and
completes her transaction Her cash is counted out into a money
drawer and she reaches in and pulls it out

Just as she turns to go a voice behind her calls out menacingly

LEADER
Well take that sister

Sally whirls around to see three GANG MEMBERS moving towards her
They have taken away her escape route She makes a fist with one
hand as if she is trying to decide whether its worth a fight

Just then a Jeep pulls into the parking lot of the bank making a
cut through to another street Its Jacks Jeep and he pauses for
a moment taking in the scene The LEADER turns to look at Jack

LEADER
Keep moving asshole

Jack looks for a moment longer then pulls out

Sally starts to raise her hands to fight and the Leader senses
what she is doing and pulls out a wicked looking knife to dissuade
her

LEADER
Its not worth it

LEADER
Remember its only money and you didnt
have it long enough to get attached to it
Sally looks at the knife then up at the Leader She takes a quick
glance around noting the surveillance camera up in one corner of
the building

LEADER
No time sugar Well be long gone and
youll be all cut up
(beat)
NOW

The Jeep pulls into the parking lot again and this time it stops
right in the middle of the lot its lights pointed straight at the
group The High Beams of the Jeep flick on momentarily blinding
everyone and the horn BLOWS

The Leader one hand over his eyes motions to one of his boys to
get rid of whoever it is

LEADER
Take care of that guy

The Gang Member goes up to the Jeep and is surprised to find it
EMPTY Running lights on but empty

GANG MEMBER
Aint nobody here

The Leader who was moving in on Sally turns to the Gang Member

LEADER
What

Just then from behind one of the bank pillars STORMS Jack
taking the Leader and the other gang members completely by
surprise Using a variety of kicks punches strikes and wrestling
moves he takes them out with little resistance He wades through
them like they were the mannequins he trains on at work

JACK
Oh yeah This is just what I needed

When hes done Jack turns to Sally and smiles then motions for
her to join him

Sally gets in Jacks Jeep and he pulls quickly out of the lot
The gang members are still on the ground some of them starting to
moan and move around a little bit

INT JACKS JEEP — SAME NIGHT

Jack is driving along and Sally is sitting very primly in Jacks
Jeep Jack steals looks at her and she looks at him sideways

Jack is intrigued by this beautiful Chinese girl

SALLY

The Jeep comes to a stop Sally opens the door and starts to get
out

disappears

They go inside

INT SALLY HOUSE — SAME NIGHT

A meat cleaver THWACKS down into a wooden cutting board and sticks
straight up

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Sallys Grandfather who was cooking dinner
when they came in He is at least 75 years old and is wearing a
dark blue Chinese silk jacket

GRANDFATHER

GRANDFATHER

JACK

GRANDFATHER

Jack holds out his hands and Grandfather holds them looking at
them and squeezing them Jack squeezes back but it has no effect
on Grandfather

GRANDFATHER
You have never trained

JACK
I can handle myself

SALLY
Grandfather what are you doing I invited
Jack in to thank him

GRANDFATHER
Maybe he set the attack up himself so he
would look good

JACK
Ive had about enough

Jack tries to pull his hands away but he cannot Jack continues
to try to pull away but Grandfather has his hands in a vice grip
GRANDFATHER
Not yet

Grandfather takes Jacks hands and forces them into the flour on
the counter top

JACK
What the hell

GRANDFATHER
OK fighter lets see how good you really
are All you have to do is touch me and I
will give you the credit you think you
deserve OK

JACK
This is ridiculous Does he do this to
every guy you bring home

SALLY

GRANDFATHER

Cmon just one touch

Jack thinking he is going to catch Grandfather unaware lunges
for him but hes no longer there Jack moves again trying to
touch him but Grandfather is a ghost No matter how he tries and
with what techniques he cant lay a finger on him

Finally Jack is so frustrated he gives up He grabs a towel and
starts to wipe the flour off his hands

JACK
I gotta get outta here Sally I1l call
you

He walks past Grandfather who is smiling in success Before he
completely passes him however Jack tries one more time to touch
him Grandfather with eyes in the back of his head moves subtly
out of the way and all Jack touches is air

SALLY
Jack dont go

Jack is already at the door and opening it He tosses the towel
back into the room Sally runs after him giving Grandfather a
very dirty look He just smiles an innocent smile that says Just
protecting you my dear

EXT SALLY HOUSE — SAME NIGHT

Jack stands in the middle of the chamber and suddenly the poles
on each side of the chamber come flying out Jack tries to avoid
the poles but still gets hit a few times while doing it

We see the computer screen measuring the result of the training

INT ROBERT OFFICE — DAY

Robert is in his office kissing with Lonnie his receptionist
when the door flies open and OATES comes in flanked by two
BODYGUARDS

They have knives drawn and they PULL Robert and Lonnie apart
Oates holding Lonnie the Bodyguards holding Robert knives at
both their throats

Robert looks at him and smiles

ROBERT

Oates moves the knife closer to Lonnies throat and she tries
pull away terrified

to
Lonnie looks at Robert stunned at what he is saying That he
would sacrifice her

Robert is still smiling until he moves and when he moves he is
incredibly quick and brutal He strikes the two bodyguards and
they go down immediately

When they are down he turns to Oates who still has the knife at
Lonnies throat

ROBERT

ROBERT

Thats only part of what I want
Robert attacks Oates and he is brutal and ruthless
He hits him with a strike to the stomach which doubles him over

ROBERT
That hurt Straighten up

With difficulty Oates straightens up and tries to hit Robert As
soon as he comes all the way back up Robert blocks his strike and
hits him again with a different technique this time Oates goes
farther down and seems to hurt much more

ROBERT
That hurt more I could tell
Interesting

OATES
(between gasps)
Cmon I said Id stop
He grabs Oates by the hair and stands him up Oates tries to swing
on Robert but he blocks it easily and drives a strike into the
arm breaking it

ROBERT
I never knew that was so effective

Oates arm hangs limply by his side and his face is a mask of
agony Robert hits him a couple more times analyzing the
reaction

ROBERT
Hmmm Lonnie you should leave now

Robert drives a knife hand into Oates collar bone breaking it
with an audible CRACK Oates screams again and now both of his
arms hang useless at his sides

ROBERT
How bad is the pain Can you describe it

No answer from Oates who is in incredible pain
He pulls back and gets himself set then drives forward with a
special technique striking Oates in the chest right where the

heart is

Oates eyes go wide and his mouth opens in a silent scream then
he drops over dead

Robert stands over Oates and studies his hand
ROBERT

We get the impression of a HUGE HULKING BEAST who appears in the
steam behind Jack who is totally unaware

The Beast comes closer big hands and arms reaching for Jack when
a muffled order is BARKED

Jack sits up straight in the whirlpool looking around for
someone something

In fact Rasputin looks really angry The Mercenary hits him with
a roundhouse right and there is NO reaction Nothing

The Mercenary stops fighting and stares at Rasputin unbelieving

THE MERCENARY

The other SuperFighters including Night Stalker and Darkcloud
are debating whether to go inside to get Rasputin They are about

completely out of him and he is just about out

He looks through the ropes trying to find Angel but instead he
spots Sally who is sitting near the side of the ring

She motions for him to get up and surprisingly he starts to get
off the canvas

Jack stands completely up and turns to The Enforcer who is urging
on the crowd in the center of the ring his back to Jack not even
looking at him

Jack goes over and taps on The Enforcers shoulder The Enforcer
turns face curious only to get BLASTED with a right cross

He stumbles back and Jack starts a series of beautiful movements
(ones that Angel taught him) The Enforcer is defenseless and he
gets rocked over and over again

Finally The Enforcer is out on his feet and Jack sizes him up
He launches and connects with a flying spinning hook kick
knocking The Enforcer out

Jacks mother relieved gets up and walks out She is not happy
but she is glad that Jack is safe

Jack lands on his feet after the kick and the crowd goes crazy
Jack raises his hands in the air and quickly goes to the side of
the ring where he saw Sally looking for her in the crowd

She is on her way to the ring

Jack goes to punch the can but Grandfather moves it so that Jack
is punching at air

can He closes his eyes and concentrates an amber glow surrounds
his hand (SFX) and then the can MOVES ABOUT SIX INCHES

All by itself

JACK
What the hell
(beat)

GRANDFATHER

Jack puts the can up on the table and put his hand out mimicking
Grandfather looking stupid He concentrates but the can refuses
to move

He then flexes his palm on Jacks shoulder and Jack goes flying
across the room SLAMMING against the wall and sliding down

Jack nods then pronounces the word correctly

What do you mean

GRANDFATHER
Attack me

Grandfather closes his eyes and Jack throws a punch at him It
looks like it is going to hit him but at the last minute
Grandfather avoids the punch redirects the force then comes back
at Jack throwing him back about 3 feet

GRANDFATHER
I am talking about spontaneous reaction
Your body has a field around it and when
an attack comes you feel it

Jack looks at Grandfather and he knows Jack doesnt understand

is trapped in a corner of the cage Budokai mounts a furious

Robert sees that Jack is not completely focused and that makes
him very angry

ROBERT
Goddamn it Fight me

JACK
How can I You gotta let them go

ROBERT
I dont think so

Robert is hitting Jack almost at will Nothing Jack does works
and he is getting slaughtered

Jack has to do something to save his mother and Sally so he
manuevers Robert into one corner and manages to hit him hard
enough to send him pitching back against a pile of junk When
Roberts back hits the boxes wire and boxes come falling down on
top of him

Jack takes this opportunity and SPRINTS to where his mother and
Sally are being held He attacks both Darkcloud and Night Stalker
and taking them by surprise quickly defeats them

Meanwhile Robert is struggling to get free

He starts to free his mother and Sally and Angel tries to help
him Jack turns to look at her and she stops

ANGLE ON ANGEL CONFLICTED

Just then Robert gets free and launches himself at Jack Jack
doesnt see him but Angel does

She jumps at Robert to put herself in between them to save Jack
Robert strikes Angel just as she lands an incredible kick on
Robert while at the same time he hits Sally and Mother away from
Angel Robert staggers a little but not before he hits Angel
several more times

Critically
Angel falls back to one side while Robert falls to the other
Angel is hurt very badly and Jack goes to her

She is dying

ANGEL
I always wanted to do the right thing
Jack

JACK

I know Angel Youre a hero
Shes gone and Jack holds her for a moment longer

Robert is struggling to clear his head and Jack stands up to face
him one last time

ROBERT
I made you a star now Im going to
destroy you

Robert SWEEPS him to the ground then stands over him

ROBERT
I told you no one disobeys me twice

He is preparing for the killing blow

ANGLE ON SALLY AND MOTHER

Sally dazed shakes her head to clear it then runs to the
junction box flipping it on and off blinking the lights like
during Jacks meditation practice

SALLY
Concentrate Jack

Unbelievably Jack CLOSES HIS EYES
Robert shocked stops for a moment watching Jack

He then smiles sensing an easy target He rears back ready to
let go with the killing blow

He launches the deadly strike and Jack BLOCKS IT
Without even opening up his eyes

Jack holds Roberts arm in front of his face then SNAPS his eyes
open

We know Robert is in trouble now
JACK
Im gonna kick your ass

Jack then accepts Roberts force and SLAMS Robert with a technique
that ROCKS him back to the other side of the ring Jack then
attacks hitting him with everything he has strikes kicks
punches knees elbows

Robert is out on his feet ready to be put away

Jack glances down at Angels unmoving form on the canvas then
turns back to Robert

He spins and leaps into the air connecting with a beautiful jump
spinning hook kick that sends Robert flying

Sally and his Mother come to Jack Sally hugs him and his Mother
puts an arm around him

Suddenly the SOUND of police sirens can be heard 0OS Grandfather
and a heavily bandaged Budokai appear there with a whole squad of
police officers

Budokai stands at the door and raises his arm in a fist salute to
Jack while Grandfather runs down to where Jack is

Jack returns the salute with Sally and his mother draped on him
They start walking away from the cage As they walk by a pile of
resin at cageside Jack puts his hand in it He then smiles and

hits Grandfather in the middle of the back

Jacks handprint stands out in stark relief on Grandfathers black
silk jacket

Grandfather smiles thinking Jack is congratulating him
Freeze Frame on huge white hand print
CREDITS ROLL

FADE OUT

THE END
