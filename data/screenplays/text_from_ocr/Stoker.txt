CLOSE ON a spider
Eyes Fangs Round hairy back pulsing with life

Cleaning itself at the center of its web its small body is a
blur of hideous industry

The image is grotesque hypnotic awesome

Nature at its deadliest and most efficient

WE WIDEN OUT revealing our little friend is someplace dark
and tight an ideal spot for going about your business

undisturbed

Until the web begins to shake Violently The spider is
startled (So are we)

Music

Someone’s playing the piano a piece and la Gnossienne No 4 by
Erik Satie

Its haunting even when played with more precision than
passion (as it is now

Each note sends vibrations shimmering down the web

The spider sets off to investigate moving rapidly over a
series of ridges and planes It comes to a smooth lacguered
surface starts to descend

As we watch it wind its way down one of the pianos front
legs we realize weve been lurking beneath the instrument
the entire time

The music continues as the spider quietly touches down on the

hardwocd flcor begins crawling stealthily toward the
pedals

CLOSE ON a shoe

The black anda white saddle kind the kind a young girl might
wear moving up and down on the gleaming brass pedals

The spider comes closer Closer

the shoe moving up and down up and down

And just as were sure this repulsive creature is about to
skitter up that shoe and sink its teeth into tender skin the

shee casually pivots toward the spider crushes it underfoot

End of spider

WE PAN UP from the shoe

Meet INDIA STOKER eighteen years old

And with no more than a glance at the thing on the floor that
used to be alive this unusually cool customer goes back to
her recital

CLOSE ON India
Not an easy face to describe

Not that it’s without beauty (it isn’t) not that it’s
without character (it isn’t) but it’s a face that gives
nothing away

You can’t talk about the view with the shade pulled down
WE WIDEN CUT taking in the scene

Dressed in a sweater set and skirt (black) hair pulled back
in a ribbon (also black) India sits at a black baby grand in
the room her mother refers to as “the parlor”

Chippendale chairs Georgian tables Louis XVI commodes A
long way from Pottery Barn

Back straight fingering correct India’s pale hands float
easily over the keys as April sunshine filters through the
big picture window behind her Outside graygreen woods and
fields stretch to the horizon and beyond

Everything before us - girl piano parlor - feels welli-
tended and appointed Tasteful And timeless

Could be 2009 or 1959 Could be color could be black and
white Could go either way

One thing we do know the music is gorgeous Too bad Indias
on auto-pilot She‘’s a human player-piano deaf to its
undercurrents of longing and loss Might as well be “Frére
Jacques”

As the piece crawls to a close a woman appears stopping just
short in the doorway

This is EVELYN “EVIE” STOKER on the other side of forty but
still full of juice still ripe for the picking (if only
someone would)

Not a hair’s out of place but her step is a little wobbly so
she discreetly (she hopes) puts a hand on the wall to steady
herself

Like her daughter Evie is dressed head-to-toe in black
(French expensive) Unlike her daughter she is garnished
with diamonds

She sweeps India with her eyes Sighs Smiles

EVIE
Darling The shoes Just this once
Bo you think

India stares at her mother with all the interest of a court
stenographer

A moment slides by We hear the tick-tock of the clock (also
French also expensive) on the carved mantelpiece

Evies smile begins to twitch

EVIE (CONTD)
Dent do this to me India Not
today Not Today

She walks away retrieving a tumbler of booze from a small
table set just outside the parlor door just out of (her
daughters) sight

EVIE (CONTD)
Get in the car

CUT TO

EXT TOWN OF MIDDLE BEND - CEMETERY -— DAY - LATER

Hillis Trees Blue sky and green grass A nice place to be
buried

WIDE ON a respectable turnout assembled for just such an
occasion Several dozen mourners gather before an open grave
the steel casket poised and waiting above the void

THE REVEREND (60s about what youd expect) intones the
traditional platitudes As the sound of his voice rises and
falls we hear only snippets

REVEREND
-Richard Stoker was first and
foremost a family man A devoted
husband to his wife Evelyn a
loving father to his daughter
India

Evie and India are seated by themselves at the front
Even in repose Evie is a standout a lily among the reeds
biack sunglasses shielding her eyes from the suns bright
glare

India sits next to her hands in her lap black and white
saddle shoes crossed demurely at the ankle

Neither of them is in tears

REVEREND (CONTD)

-A pillar of our small community
Richard was a model to the town of
Middle Bend

At the back stand townsfolk from the aforementioned town
Acquaintances mostly People who had business with Richard
Stoker or knew him socially People who game to show their
respects or to satisfy curiosity People who had nothing
better to do

REVEREND (CONT‘D)
-What it means to be a man to
walk through this world with
openness honesty integrity

A breese ruffles India’s hair She turns her face to the sun
cicses her eyes When she opens them she sees something she
didnt expect a man alone on the hiliside above the funeral
party He’s standing quite still hands shoved deep in his
pockets

REVEREND (CONTD)
«Richard Stoker was taken from us
by a cruel twist of fate for
reasons unknown and unknowable

India squints into the sun trying to get a better look But
from this distance the man’s features are a blur indistinct

Someone coughs behind her loudly India turns to look
When she turns back the man is gone

REVEREND (CONT’D)
-Let us bow our heads

India bows her head with the rest but her eves remain fixed
on the empty hiliside

CUT TO

Caught out the women fall silent turning sheepishly to face

agifferent calibre the Stoker’s housekeeper is more than a
Match for a couple of local yokels

I mean it won’t happen again Mrs
McGarrick

HIRED WOMAN NUMBER TWO
Wo it wont happen again

MRS MCGARRICK
Good Alright Go on And try to
remember where you are

The women exit the kitchen quickly platters in hand

Mrs MeGarrick watches them go sighs turns back toward the
island and we reveal India sitting all the way down at the
other end

Whether or not she’s been listening is (to Mrs McGarrick at
least) unclear

Perched on a tall wooden stool India is carefully arranging
deviled eggs on a large serving tray set in front of her
Moving from one egg to the next her work is slow
methodical with attention paid to detail

Mrs McGarrick comes to stand over India’s shoulder
surveying the eggs critically

MRS MCGARRICK (CONTD)
Now I’m worrying I might’ve kept
them in the fridge too long What
do you think Miss India

No response Mrs McGarrick tries again

MRS MCGARRICK (CONTD)
You don’t think I was too stingy
with the paprika do you

No response Still Mrs MeGarrick’s attitude remains kindly
maternal It’s clear she cares about the girl It’s also
clear she’s used to her peculiarities

MRS MCGARRICK (CONT‘D)
Alright I guess they’1ll do But
watch you don’t get any on yourself
though Or your mother’1il skin us
both

Again no response Hint taken Mrs McGarrick finally
shuffles off leaving India alone at the island

We suddenly hear a spike in the noise level beyond the
kitchen It sounds almost merry

India turns her head frowning slightly She wipes her hands
on a dishtowel rises

Approaching the swing door to the dining room she pauses
listening to the voices on the other side the sound of her
mother’s (inappropriate) laughter

India puts a hand on the door and after a moment pushes it
open

INT STOKER RESIDENCE DINING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

The swing door opens and ALL SOUND DROPS AWAY

There he is The man from the hillside

Hes standing at the center of a small crowd of mourners

Evie stands next to him one hand clutching a drink and the
other his arm as if afraid shell fall over if she lets go
(Ox that he‘ll get away Maybe both)

But India‘s attention is not on her mother

He is tall wide-shouldered with a handsome unlined face
Almost boyish Hair shiny and clean cut short and parted on
the side Not dressed for a funeral really but still
presentable in a corduroy jacket (tailored) blue oxford
shirt khaki pants (flat-front) and loafers

He looks like a natty schoolteacher from the 50’s Or a
missionary maybe

Whatever he is he’s in her dining room
India watches her mother try (unsuccessfully) to stifle
another laugh (He must be very amusing) Then seeing India
in the doorway Evie opens her mouth to speak
THE SOUND RETURNS IN A RUSH
EVIE
India India darling come and say
hello to your Uncle Charlie

The man turns his head in India’s direction Meet UNCLE
CHARLIE younger brother of the recently deceased

India icoks into his eyes and freezes
EVIE (CONTD)

backward toward the safety of the kitchen Her eyes remain
locked on Uncle Charlies her breath quickening

And then he winks at her

EVIE (CONT’D)
India Come here at oncel

(to Uncle Charlie)
Honestly she can be so stand-
offish sometimes But I guess we
know who she gets that from

Evie shakes her head annoyed Then seeming to change her
mind she smiles at her daughter takes another sip from her
glass turns back to Uncle Charlie

BVIEB (CONTD)

I swear this is some kind of
miracle Charlie Richard used to
say you were lost forever

India forgotten backs quietly into the kitchen allowing
the door to swing shut on its own The last thing she sees is
Unele Charlie smiling warmly giving her mother his full
attention

INT STOKER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
India turns around light-headed and finds Mre McGarrick
standing in front of her looking concerned The two hired
women hover behind their eyes large and curious
MRS MCGARRICK
Why India sweetheart youre

INT STIGKER RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
Blackness A door opens at the top of the stairs

Its India silhouetted against the light from the kitchen
behind her

She steps down carefully The stairs are old rickety

When she gets to the bottom she sets one of the tubs down
reaches wp into the darkness finds a chain pulls it A bulb
flickers on dangling from a long cord overhead It doesnt
do much

With a practiced motion India sets the bulb swinging its
arc illuminating first one side of the space then the other

India picks up the ice cream keeps walking But the basement
is a warren of unfinished rooms and soon shes standing in
the dark again

Endia puts the tub dewn a second time reaches up finds a
second chain pulls it Another bulb flickers on It teo is
set swinging

SHE HEARS A NOISE BEHIND HER

India whirls around

She doesn’t appear frightened but she’s not exactly calm
either

As the bulb swings overhead we see her disappear and
reappear disappear and reappear

India scans the basement senses alert It’s damp down here
cold and creepy boxes and furniture stacked all around
Plenty of places to hide if one were so inclined

Finally satisfied she’s alone India turns around and keeps
walking approaching what looks like a giant metal coffin
Its the deep freezer humming quietly to itself along the
far wall

Shes about to lift the lid WHEN SHE HEARS SOMETHING AGAIN
India looks over her shoulder breath catching

She holds perfectly still eyes scanning the darkness
listening

She can hear the creak of the light swinging back and forth
back and forth

We see her disappear and reappear disappear and reappear
India waits another beat

Nothing

Keeping her eyes on the room behind her India opens the
freezer and quickly dumps the ice cream inside Mission

accomplished she gets out of there as fast as she can
letting the lid fall shut on its own

And in those final seconds before it closes with a thud
briefly illuminated by the swinging of the bulbs WE SEE MRS
MCGARRICK INSIDE THE FREEZER TUCKED IN AMONG THE FROZEN
FOODS BYES STARING MOUTH OPEN KINDLY FACE BRUSHED WITH
FROST

looks around

The door opens wider She pokes her head farther out

HER FIRST POV to the left the manager‘s office The
windows are now dark

HER SECOND POV to the right a payphone across the
parking lot from her room

Auntie Gin looks around again Coast clear Then she sets off
toward the managers office She reaches the door tries the
knob Locked

Frustrated she turns around looks back toward her room The
door is still open a crack She can see the light from the TV
flickering inside

Auntie Gin looks toward the payphone all the way across the
lot Thinks for a moment In for a penny in for a pound

She starts walking toward the payphone nothing to light the
way except the street Lamp and its dull fluorescent glow

She picks up speed as she goes turning her head to look left
and right her old lady slippers making small smacking sounds
on the concrete

She reaches the payphone at last out of breath
Auntie Gin lifts the receiver begins to dial
AND A LONG SHADOW FALLS ACROSS THE KEYPAD

She tuzns around slowly face sagging Her mouth drops open
A low moan escapes

WE STAY ON Auntie Gin as a man’s hand reaches into frame
gingerly takes the receiver from her trembling fingers

SOUNDS OF A DIAL TONE OVER A SERIES OF SHOTS
The motel

The street lamp

The parking lot

The pool

EXT MIDDLE BEND HIGH - THE NEXT DAY — AFTERNOON

SLOW FADE IN

Birds tweeting sun shining The ringing of bells as students
burst through the main exit Children laughing and calling to
each other heading home

India is not among them

We see Uncle Charlie waiting at the curb with the car but
India never shows

EXT MIDDLE BEND HIGH - SIDE DOOR » SAME

Down the street from the schools main exit a door opens

India peeks out looks around The door opens wider She
pokes her head farther out sees Uncle Charlie waiting with
the car up the street not looking her way

India quickly slips out the side door head lowered walking
in the opposite direction Rounding a corner shea makes her
way down the narrow service alley behind the school

Then she stops There’s something up ahead something she
doesnt like the look of

But she can’t go back the other way not with Uncle Charlie
there waiting

So taking a deep breath India decides to keep going
She heads down the service alley pressing forward As she

does WE SWIVEL AROUND HER to reveal Pitts and his crew
lounging on the steps of the school’s service entrance

India is going to walk right by them

She clutches her books tighter forcing herself to look
straight ahead forcing herself not to run

And she passes them
And just when we think she’s going to make it out of there -

PITTS
Hey Stoker

India throws a look over her shoulder but doesn’t stop When

she locks back one of the jocks is standing right in front
of her

India tries to move around him but he moves jeft when she
moves left moves right when she moves right

PITTS (CONT’D)

Hey Stoker I’m talking to you Or
ago you go by “Stroker” now ‘Cause
tT hear that’s what your mom’s been
doing to your uncle

The boys snort with laughter

PITTS (CONTD)
Tell me something Stroker - you
gettin’ in on that

And then to their surprise and delight India turns around
In twelve years of shared schooling she’s never said a word
to any of them

Thats about to change

INDIA
What did you say

The boys start hooting thrilled they finally got a rise out
of her This is getting good

PITTS
(mocking)
What did you say”
(winking suggestively)
I think you heard me Stroker

More laughter

India waiks up the steps so shes standing eye-to-eye with
Pitts fijust like someone taught her)

She can see the vein throbbing below his right eye She can
smell the Doritos on his breath

Glieeful shouts from the peanut gallery This just gets better

Surprised publicly called out Pitts steps into her nice and
close Time to tip the scales

PITTS
I think you‘’d better watch your
step Stroker You know what
happens to little girls who fuck
with me
(beat)
They get fucked

Pitts grins makes like he’s going to walk away then turns

back AND THROWS A PUNCH stopping his fist half an inch from
her face

India doesn’t flinch Not even a little

And that’s when Pitts sees something shift behind her eyes

flicker that makes him take the smallest step back

WHIP Alright Pitts Enough

It’s Whip appearing out of nowhere He strolls up the steps
nonchalant coming to stand beside them

PITTS
Fuck off Whip

Whip isn’t bigger than Pitts but the alpha card is still his
to play

WHIP

Follow the bouncing ball jackass -
she’s not interested

Pissed secretly relieved he’s been given an exit strategy
Pitts spits out a bitter laugh starts walking away

PITTS
Yeah - like I enjoy wasting my time
on this bitch

He retreats quickly giving India a look that’s hateful (and
maybe a little bit fearful too) His buddies follow

Whip watches them go turns back to India

INT STOKER RESIDENCE PARLOR - AFTERNOON - LATER
India is at the piano hands frozen on the keys

She is utterly alone No Evie no Ungle Charlie no Mre
MeGarrick No one Not a sound from the rest of the house

CLOSE ON India’s normally placid face now rippling with the
tiniest of tremors

After a moment she begins to play It‘s the same song from
the beginning the one she played before her fathers
funeral

But this time her playing is hesitant unsure She fumbles
the notes one after the other

India stops starts over Again her fingers betray her Its
not coming this time

She stops swallowing hard like there’s something caught in
her throat (Tears A scream)

India closes her eyes

When she opens them Uncle Charlie is standing next to the
pianc

Without a word he sits down beside her
And he starts to play Beautifully

Its the same piece India was playing a moment before

But this time it’s different This time it’s resonant with
passion and feeling Emotion

India sits there entranced listening to the piece like
she’s never heard it before

She glances up looking from Uncle Charlies fingertips to
his face He seemg lost in the music completely engrossed

He hasnt looked at her once

Then India looks down sets her fingers on the keys and
Starts to play

Shes tentative at first cautious improvising a quiet
harmony to his melody

But she gains confidence quickly their strange collaboration
evolving rapidly into something effortless and organic A
minor piece for two hands becoming a major one for four

The music starts to crescendo The tempo to quicken

India can feel her temperature begin to rise She steals
another glance at Uncle Charlie

Hes pounding away at the keys busy weaving chords so
intertwined so intimate she cant tell where their lines
end and begin

India looks back down forgetting him now entirely and their
hands skate across the keyboard Faster and faster

Caressing and coaxing stabbing and demanding

It’s romantic and roiling relentless - something Philip
Glass might cook up during a lightening storm

And then theyre crashing into and through the final
climactic chords Their combined sustain reverberating
throughout the house

And then its over

India removes her hands from the keys gently as if they
might break

They sit in silence for a moment until he turns to her
waits for her to look at him

UNCLE CHARLIE
Thank you

And he’s gone

India is left alone Sweating Shaken

India wakes with a start on the chintz-covered sofa in the
parlor Her eyes are dazed her forehead damp It’s dark She
jooks at her watch 8 oclock

Then India tilts her head toward the doorway listening We
hear music

Someone singing

India walks into the foyer the music getting louder It
sounds like it’s coming from the back of the house Jo
Stafford crooning No Other Love” Old-timey Cheesy (And
beautiful)

tndia walks into the dining room sees light shining beneath
the swing door to the kitchen She tip-toes to the door
hears music coming from the other side

She pushes it open a crack and sees her mother ang Uncle
Charlie slow dancing in the kitchen

India watches as they make their way around the island lost
ain their own world a small transistor radio playing on the
counter

Evie has her head on Uncle Charlie’s shoulder Her eyes are
closed her expression peaceful

Uncle Charlie’s arms are strong around Evie’s waist holding
her close He seems dreamy far away

UNTIL HE LOOKS RIGHT AT HER

india gasps letting the door swing shut She backs away
turning and running fleeing into the darkness beyond

India and Whip walk along a densely wooded path the “Goldy’s

them They take their time winding their way toward a
playground in the middle of the park

A breeze blows Stars shine Night sounds all around them

INDIA
Yes I know what you mean

WHIP
Oh yeah Hows that

Theyve reached the playground now walking over to a little
metal roundabout painted red India sits down on it Using
one foot she sets herself and the roundabout in motion

When she finally speaks her words are hesitant halting
While far from unsophisticated it would seem self-
examination is not a favorite past-time

Unlike her peers India is clearly not in the habit of taking
her emotional temperature every five minutes let alone
sharing the results with strange boys in the park

Yet here she ig In the park With a strange boy

INDIA
Has someone ever shown you a
photograph of yourself and it was
taken when you didn’t know you were
being photographed And its you
but it’s you from an angie youve
never seen before An angle you
dont get to see when youre
looking in the mirror

The roundabout continues its humble rotation taking India
for a spin

INDIA (CONT ’D)
It’s you but you don’t look like
you And you think “That‘s me
That‘s also me” Do you Do
you know what I’m talking about

She looks at him questioningly as if wondering whether they
could possibly speak the same language

Whip stumbles backward up against a tree
India closes in kissing him deeply Again

theyve moved away from the little playground now into the
woods Where its dark Private

India pushes into him feeling his mouth on her mouth his
hands around her waist

She’s alert to everything - the earth beneath their feet the
bark behind Whips back the heat of their bodies the warmth

of their breath the cool of the night air against their
skin

Its sensory overload Too much and not enough all at the
same time

Whip groans softly totally floored by this girl

And then India bites down on his Jip Hard Brawing blood

WHIP

Whip jerks his head away puts fingers to his wounded mouth

He stares at her incredulous India stares back with an
almost identical expression

INDIA REARS BACK AND STRIKES HIM BRUTALLY ACROSS THE FACE
knocking his head back against the tree

She breaks loose gasping turning to run for the
playground

BUT WHIP GRABS HER FROM BEHIND throws her down on the grass
flips hex over on her back

India lets loose with a blood-curdling scream

Not of terror but of fury

mouth)

India opens her eyes wondering why he’s stopped why he’s
not moving why shes been spared

Then suffocating under the weight of him she pushes Whip
off of her

She sits up slowly confused India looks over at Whip lying
motionless in the grass Then she looks down at her hands

THEYRE COVERED IN BLOOD It’s everywhere

India looks at Whip again THIS TIME SHE SEES THE SIDE OF HIS
HEAD HAS BEEN BASHED IN

HES DEAD

She looks up There’s someone standing over her silhovetted
against the stars

dark and wet with Whip’s blood

Its a shocking suspended moment They stare at each other
gauging assessing

jeans today Until now its always been dresses and skirts

fhis seems iike a small but definite shift

She pauses at the threshold We get the sense this is not a
room shes visited often

The setting is masculine - dark leather a fieldstone
fireplace wood paneling painted that British racing green

India takes a step inside looking around walks over to what
was clearly her father’s desk

SHOTS of India standing over the desktop examining the items
she finds there Mont Blanc pens black-framed reading
glasses assorted paperweights etc

India picks up a silver-framed photo of herself and her
father taken long ago She’s sitting in her father’s lap
both of them looking toward camera both clearly
uncomfortable both clearly pretending not to be

India does not trace her father’s face with her finger
Nothing of the kind She merely studies him for a moment
Then she pute the picture down careful to return it to its
eriginal position

SHOTS of India opening various desk drawers not touching
whats inside Files mostly This is a respectful
investigation The word “rifling” does not apply

She tries the bottom desk drawer Locked She goes through
the pencil drawer again finds a small key tries it on the
locked drawer It opens

Inside is a handgun a large bundle of letters tied with
String and a small cardboard box

India leaves the gun where it is takes the box out opens
it

Inside are black and white photos

toddler on his lap The third boy sits a few steps down from
the other two He’s small for his age with an eerily
expressionless face

All three wear short-sleeve shirts khaki shorts and tennis
shoes —- summer uniforms of the privileged from days gone by

India turns the photo over On the back written in a
beautiful cursive in faded ink

“Richard 17) Charles and Jonathan Summer fun”
india flips to the next photo

The same teenager (Richard) now wearing a sweater and long
pants sits under a lavish Christmas tree face dark and
solemn The little boy (Charles) sits next to him laughing
looking up at his older brother adoringly

whe baby is nowhere to be seen

India turns the picture over In the same writing as before
R and C Xmas” And that‘s it No Jonathan

India puts the photos back in the box turns back to the desk
drawer removes the large packet of letters She freezes when
she sees the letter on top is addressed to her

India tears off the string There must be hundreds of them
All addressed to her

Stunned she sinks down to the rug sets the letters in front
of her in a pile opens one at random

-All my love Charlie

It is now dusk

Staring into space India carefully puts the last letter back
in its envelope Picking up her precious stack holding her
letters close to her chest she gets up and walks out of the
room

INT STOKER RESIDENCE FOYER « DUSK » CONTINUOUS

India starts up the stairs gaining speed as she goes When
she gets to the second floor landing she turns the corner
heading toward the room at the end of the hall She is almost
running as she reaches it -

INT STOKER RESIDENCE -— UNCLE CHARLIE‘’S ROOM - DUSK - CONT

The door flies open -

INDIA
Uncle Charlie

But no one’s there

India looks around disappointed As she turns to go she
drops one of the letters It lands on the floor backside up

Seeing something odd she bends over picks it up Brow
furrowed India walks over to the window holding the letter
in the fading light so she can see better

The return address is a rubber stamp

This is what it says
WRENFIELD INST BOX 6292 WRENFIELD PA 19086

Not Shanghai Not Monte Carlo

India chocses another letter flips it over Same stamp

She flips through one letter after the other dropping them
on the floor as she goes Theyre all stamped with the same
address

WRENFIELD INST BOX 6292 WRENFIELD PA 19086

Different stationery same return address

India lets the last one fall from her hands Then her eyes
dart to Uncle Charlies suitcase sitting in its usual place

by the closet door

Without a moment’s hesitation she goes to the suitcase
kneels dewn opens it

India tears through what she finds there - neatly pressed
shirts a couple of ties clean handkerchiefs Totally
unremarkable everyday items

And then everything comes to a halt

Theres one thing left in the suitcase Hands shaking India
reaches down to the bottom pulls out a man’s leather wallet

It’s worn and smooth with an “R“ and an “S” embossed in
Faded gold

Byes round she flips it open to a small laminated copy of
the photo we just saw in the study downstairs The photo of
India and her father

It‘s her father’s wallet

CLOSE ON India’s face as the world starts to shift and slide
around her

INT STOKER RESIDENCE - FOYER EVENING - LATER

Uncle Charlie walks through the front door half-carrying
Evie who is very much out of it but in otherwise excellent
spirits Uncle Charlie pauses looks around

hand please

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
India

They stumble to the foot of the stairs laughing Then he
sweeps Evie off her feet begins carrying her up to her
bedroom a perverse echo of a bride and her groom on their
wedding night

Nearing the top they see India waiting on the second floor
landing Evie gives her daughter a friendly wave

EVIE
Hello darling

They reach the landing walk over to India Uncle Charlie
still carrying Evie in his arms

UNCLE CHARLIE

(amused)
t found her down in the woods past
the tennis court Can‘t figure

how she got that far I was looking
for her for hours

India just stares at him her face a careful blank

Evie looks dazedly from one to the other smiling blissfully
unaware of the silent conversation taking place just over her
head

UNCLE CHARLIE (CONTD)
(finally)
Well I guess we both found what
we were looking for

then he turns away and starts down the hall toward Evie’s
bedroom Evie waves to India as she goes

CUT TO

INT STOKER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NICHT - LATER
The swing door opens and Uncle Charlie walks in
India is at the sink her back to him

Her father’s wallet sits on the island between them It is
the only thing on the countertop

After a long moment India turns around and we see that she
is dry-eyed calm bizarrely collected considering the
circumstances One more indication that we are dealing with
someone far from ordinary

EXT WRENFIELD - FLASHBACK - DAY

An empty road somewhere deep in the mountains Dark skies
Pouring rain

A Jeep Grand Woody drives by SPLASHING CAMERA

INTEXT CAR - FLASHBACK - DAY - CONTINUOUS
Sounds of windshield wipers sloshing back and forth

BR hand reaches down to the heater turns it up a notch WE
PAN UP from the heater to the man we just saw posing with
India in the silverframed photograph

Meet Richard Stoker Uncle Charlies older brother

He’s late 40s tall heavy-set Kind of tweedy (At the
moment a very damp kind of tweedy)

Hard to imagine this person with Evie Then again looking
more carefully you can see he might have been handsome once
Maybe even impressive Someone with breeding and potential

But a life spent in the shadow of horror hag clearly taken
its toll

Richards got his eyes on the road but his mind is someplace
else

He flies past a sign “Wrenfield - A Great Place to Visit An
Even Better Place to Live”

GRAINY FLASH A LONG WOODEN STAIRCASE STRETCHING FROM A
CLIFF’S EDGE DOWN TO A BEACH FAR BELOW THE OCEAN BEFORE

Back to Richard listening to the windshield wipers going
back and forth back and forth He blinks takes a breath and
exhales trying to shake it off

GRAINY FLASH WE’RE DOWN ON THE SAND NOW WE LOOK TO OUR
RIGHT SEE A GLAMOROUS-LOOKING WOMAN IN HER 40S SHES
WEARING A BATHING SULT SITTING UNDER A STRIPED UMBRELLA AND
READING A BOOK

SHE TURNS TO US LISTENING FOR A MOMENT THEN SAYS SOMETHING
WE CANT UNDERSTAND SHAKING HER HEAD NO

WE LOOK TO OUR LEFT ALL THE WAY DOWN THE BEACH TO A SMALL
OUTCROPPING OF ROCKS WE SEE SOMETHING SMALL AND DARK
MOVING QUICKLY OUT OF SIGHT WE START HEADING IN THAT
DIRECTION WALKING AT FIRST

AND THEN WE START TO RUN

Back to Richard moisture on his brow He unbuttons another
button around the collar of his oxford shirt

WITH AN ODD LOOK ON HIS FACE

HE LOOKS HAPPIER NOW SITTING IN THE SAND IN HIS LITTLE SWIM
TRUNKS BUSY MAKING CASTLES WITH A PLASTIC SHOVEL AND PAIL

Back to Richard breathing in through his nose and out
through his mouth trying to calm his rattled nerves

His car slows down in front of tall iron gates turns in We
see a discreet sign posted on one side of the entry
WRENFIELD INSTITUTE A Home Away From Home Founded 1875

GRAINY FLASH WE‘RE NOW STANDING OVER THE LITTLE BOY HE
DOESNT LOOK UP JUST GOES ABOUT HIS BUSINESS CAREFULLY
PATTING THE SAME LITTLE SPOT OF SAND WITH HIS SHOVEL AGAIN

A catacomb-Llike corridor poorly lit and eerily quiet

A patient (elderly vacant stare) shuffles silently PAST
CAMERA accompanied by an orderly in white We reveal Richard
sitting behind them in the shadows all alone on a long
wooden bench

He’s calmer now but still simmering under the surface
agitated and apprehensive his eyes ringed with darkness

A thick metal door opens down the hali from the bench A
woman walks out of an office turns to him This is THE
DOCTOR (60s no-nonsense white consultation coat) When she
speaks she speaks with a French agcent

THE DOCTOR
Mr Stoker

Richard looks at her stands bracing for what comes next

wails painted public school gray The doctor walks a pace or

Your parents saw to that thirty
years ago when he first came
here As you are no doubt aware

Richar reaches for a degree of composure Sadly his reach
is a little short today

RICHARD
I don’t I don’t quite understand
what I’m supposed to do now What
am I What are the things I need

to know

The doctor stops in front of a closed metal door turns to
face him tired but not unsympathetic

RICHARD (CONTD)
(almost stammering)
Please Doctor I’m just trying
to to understand my options
here

He locks like he’s about ten seconds from bolting

THE DOCTOR
Mr Stoker you must try to accept
that the present is the present and
the past the past If we enter into
a situation believing the worst

will occur we have already gone a
long way toward guaranteeing it

Richard looks far from convinced

THE DOCTOR (CONTD)
Im afraid theres nothing more T
can do for you Mr Stoker Im
sorry You have my number And I
will have you in my thoughts And
my prayers

She turns to the door unlocks and opens it

WE REVEAL UNCLE CHARLIE sitting in what is surprisingly a
cheery little room Whatever we might have been expecting
this isnt it

We see an oriental rug on the floor a lamp and a comfortable
reading chair by the (barred) window The walls are painted a
warm yellow lined floor-to-ceiling with books There’s a
neatly-made bed in one corner and an upright piano in the
other the latter looking polished and well-cared for

Its clear that someone has worked hard to make this room
comfortable and inviting a stark contrast to the rest of the
facility

When we next see India she’s standing in the same spot near
the sink

But Uncle Charlie stands much closer

He’s now exactly where he stood the night they washed dishes
together after dinner looking at India with an expression
beyond expectant aware of fault lines shifting aware that
everything - everything - hinges on what happens next

Finally India breaks the silence And when she speaks her
tone is almost matter-of-fact Something that would chill
anyone other than the man standing next to her

INDIA
(eyes down)
Why now

UNCLE CHARLIE
What do you mean

INDIA
I mean why now Why come back now
Why wait so long

Uncle Charlie slides down the counter a little closing the
distance between them

EVIE Brava

India looks up surprised sees her mother in the parlor
doorway

Evie is almost unrecognizable to us Slouched and disheveled
clearly unwashed she’s an unsettling shadow of the woman we
first met in that very same doorway the day of her husbands
funeral

run
India trails off

So helpful Or should I say handy
She gives India a look

EVIE (CONTD)
Or maybe you have your own word for
it

Evie chuckles darkly then falls silent again India keeps
her eyes cn the table on the swing door on the sideboard
Anywhere but on the woman sitting next to her

EVIE (CONT’D)
Im hungry Starving in fact

INDIA
He should be back soon

Evie takes a big gulp of wine polishing it off Plunks the
glass down on the glossy tabletop

EVIE
Id like another please

India rises goes to the sideboard retrieving the open
bottle of wine She fills her mother’s glass keeping a
discreet distance between them Then she sits back down puts
the bottle on the table between them

EVIE (CONTD)
Why dont you pour one for
yourself Youre old enough now

India looks at her mother wondering where this is going
Evie stares back until India drops her eyes

India does as she’s told She gets up again goes to the
sideboard gets another glass sits back down She reaches
for the bottle fills it

India takes a small sip of wine looking at her mother over
the rim of the glass wary

Then she takes a larger sip

Then Evie lifts her own glass and drains it in one gulp Sets
it back down on the table

Beat

EVIE (CONT‘D)

You know I’ve often wondered why
it is that people have children in
the first place And the
conclusion I’ve come to is that
at gome point in our lives we
realize that things are fucked up
beyond repair 80 we decide to
start again Wipe the slate clean
Start fresh And we have
children Little carbon copies we
can turn to and say “You will do
what £ could not You will
succeed where I have failed”
Because we want someone to get it
right this time for chrissake

(beat)
But not me Not me my darling

Bvie leans in close to her daughter making sure she has her
undivided attention

EVIE (CONTD)

Personally speaking I cannot wait
to watch life tear you apart

Then Evie sits back in her chair And then she starts to cry

big shuddering sobs ratcheting up from her small shattered
center

India doesnt move a muscle nor does she look away this
time as her mother unravels right there at the table

EVIE (CONTD)

Oh India Oh India I’m so
frightened I’m so frightened for
you
