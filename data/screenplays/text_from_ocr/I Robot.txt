FADE IN

On a DEEPDEEPDARKNESS

A FLICKER Of LIGHT Off to the side Just barely
Noticeable ORANGEYELLOWas we realiseIts FIRE

A SOUND Something SHATTERING

Then A DISEMBODIED VOICE Muted We cant quite make out
What its saying As it gets LOUDER And LOUDER When we
finally Understand

DISEMBODIED VOICE
You are in danger

CUT TO
INT SPOONERS APARTMENT - CLOSE ON
DEL SPOONERS FACE His eyes snapping open His face
covered in sweat
PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed Sheets tangled around
his legs Alarm clock playing something relentlessly
cheerful
Spooner slaps it off Sits up Wincing Bends his RIGHT
ARM Stiff He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS Shakes out a
couple and swallows them Trying to forget That dream
You are in danger
He rubs his hands over his face Gets out of bed His
apartment basic Unremarkable Bearing the signs of

someone who lives alone Shades drawn A little messy

INT SHOWER - MORNING

Spooner turns his face into the jet of water
INT BATHROOM - MORNING

Shaves with a razor Using his left hand Knicks the cleft
of his chin Shit

INT KITCHEN - MORNING

Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan Waiting for it
to boil

INT HALLWAY - MORNING

Heads down the hallway Looping a knotted tie around his
neck Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches
for the handle Takes a deep breath and

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

steps outside Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the
elevated trains Elbow to elbow A river of humanity

Spooner moves along like everyone else Suddenly His
shoulders tense That feeling at the back of his neck He
turns and sees

A ROBOT Just behind him Humanoid in design but still
obviously a machine Metal and synthetic casings covering
hydraulic muscles The thing senses his stare Looks up
with a muted WHIR

ROBOT
(metallic voice)
Good day sir

Spooner Speeds up his pace Weaving through the crowd to
lose the robot

We now realise this is THE FUTURE Towering apartment
buildings block the sun The street packed with traffic
PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting
portable offices Spooner throws a look at his surroundings

Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building
cleaning windows

A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently
repairs the street No human supervision

A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW Lumbering along the sidewalk
Scrubbing sweeping Emptying trash

Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd Following their owners

Walking slowly deliberately Carrying boxes Groceries
Briefcases

Stamped on all the ROBOTS SIDES a LOGO III LAWS SAFE
Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS
Directly in front of him a LITTLE GIRL clutches her fathers

neck She smiles big at Spooner Front teeth missing

LITTLE GIRL

Hi

SPOONER

Hi
But its not her father Its her ROBOT CARETAKER The
robot turns Looks at the girl

ROBOT

You are not allowed to talk to

strangers
Spooner disgusted Has had enough He steps off the curb
Just as
THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL swivels around Training its large

digital EYE on him

TRAFFIC LIGHT
Please return to the sidewalk

Spooner dodges several cars on his way across the street

TRAFFIC LIGHT
Please return to the sidewalk

The traffic signal tracking him
TRAFFIC LIGHT
You are in violation of city

ordinance 14-B726

Spooner throws up his hand Flipping it the bird just as

SNAP It takes his picture

CUT TO

EXTINT MONORAIL - MORNING 8

Spooner stepping onto a sleek densely packed TRAIN Looks
down at his feet A trampled flyer on the ground From the
Anti-Robot League METAL MONSTERS SECRET FACTORY REVEALED
A Robot gets up To offer him his seat Spooner Turns his
back on him as we PULL BACK from the window to REVEAL

EXT CITY SCAPEMONORAIL - CONTINUOUS 9

The TRAIN hurtling toward DOWNTOWN Soaring gravity-defying
OFFICE BUILDINGS dominate the skyline Older buildings
wedged among the new All protected by huge glass and steel
shields

As we get closer congested roads and freeways begin to
disappear below ground into a series of subterranean tunnels
The old streets have become huge spacious plazas

EXT POLICE HQ - PLAZA - MORNING 10

Spooner moves with the CROWD towards the doors of the aging
Police Headquarters Modern additions have been made to the
original facade -- creating an ungainly architectural mess

INT POLICE HQ - HOMICIDE UNIT - MORNING 11

A vast open plan situation room lined on one side by a series
of glass-enclosed rooms On the other side a GIANT SCREEN
with real time video of various streets and buildings

Spooner arrives at his desk Unlike the others its a mess
A slender computer screen curving along the front of it
Several electronic messages say the same thing

SEE ME

LT BERGIN (0S)
Ever heard the phrase lead by
example

Spooner looks up LIEUTENANT JOHN BERGIN stands in front of
his desk holding up a CITATION with a photo of Spooner
giving that traffic signal the finger

SPOONER
Doesnt ring a bell

LT BERGIN
(pointing to Spooners
badge)
Its on your badge

Spooner takes the citation Drops it into a drawer filled
with about fifty others

LT BERGIN
The traffic division filed an
official complaint this morning

SPOONER
The traffic division is a machine

LT BERGIN
Look I know theres going to be an
adjustment period Del

SPOONER
(interrupting)
Ill send them a letter of apology
Maybe some flowers A box of

chocolates

JUST THEN Spooners phone RINGS He throws Bergin a look
Then snatches up the receiver
SPOONER
Spooner homicide
CUT TO
EXT US ROBOTICS - ESTABLISHING - DAY 12

A sprawling glass and metal complex covering many city
blocks The entrance is a large plaza filled with PEOPLE and
ROBOTS

INT US ROBOTICS - METAL CORRIDOR - DAY 13

An elevator opens with a whoosh Spooner steps out into a
featureless corridor His footsteps echoing He stops at a
set of OPPOSING DOORS Looks over at one when the other
suddenly OPENS
14 INT US ROBOTICS - PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A warm mahogany-paneled room In sharp contrast to the cold
metal space outside Spooner steps inside At the end of a
long conference table sits an OLD MAN Sparkling blue eyes
Old-fashioned suit

OLD MAN
Hello there Please come in

Spooner hesitates

OLD MAN
Its alright You can sit Sit
Spooner doesnt Looks around the room The Old Man lifts
up a coffee pot Pours some coffee into a single cup
OLD MAN
Coffee
SPOONER
(interested)

Youre offering me a cup of coffee

OLD MAN

Yes But you are to say No
thank you

Spooner nods a little The Old Man raises the coffee to his
lips but doesnt take a sip

OLD MAN
Coffee
SPOONER
No Thank you
OLD MAN

As you wish

The Old Man takes a sip He doesnt move There is no
movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee
pot

SPOONER
You want to tell me something about
Dr Hogenmiller About his death
The Old Man smiles

OLD MAN
I want to tell you that his death
was not a suicide

SPOONER
And why do you say that

OLD MAN
Why Because I want you to know
it

SPOONER

I understand that But what
specifically leads you to believe
that he didnt commit suicide

OLD MAN
(considers)
Nothing specifically

Spooner shifts his weight Agitated

SPOONER
Under normal circumstances that
wouldnt be enough to get youa
homicide investigation

OLD MAN
But this is not normal
circumstances is it Detective
Spooner

SPOONER
No It isnt

OLD MAN
Then you will find out who killed
Dr Hogenmiller yes And then you
will tell me

Spooners losing his patience
SPOONER

If you were murdered Doctor Ill
find out And youll be the first
JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst
of LIGHT as does the table the coffee pot and the
conference room Spooner suddenly finds himself standing in
front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER

15 INT HALLWAY - DAY

Spooner steps out into the hallway and intoAN ESCORT
ROBOT
ESCORT ROBOT
Please follow me
Spooner Reluctantly starts to follow it Passes another
doorway POLICE TAPE stretched across it Catches a brief
glimpse of

DR HEINRICH HOGENMILLERS BODY

Splayed out across the floor Surrounded by CRIME SCENE
TECHNICIANS He pauses Taking in the scene Then
continues on

16 INT US ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY

Two large doors emblazoned with the US ROBOTICS LOGO open
automatically Inside an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom
looking out over the entire complex

Spooner walks through the doorway His escort robot trailing
behind him An army of corporate types sit around a
conference table Young Energetic You can practically

feel the brains and ambition

SPOONER
Usually I ask whos in charge

Spooners eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the
table 60s handsome charismatic Dr LANCE ROBERTSON
founder and CEO of US Robotics

SPOONER
But everyone knows you Dr
Robertson

Robertson smiles Pretends to instruct his people
ROBERTSON
Remind me to cut back on my talk
show appearances

LAUGHTER

ROBERTSON
Welcome to US Robotics
Detective I regret youre not
visiting us under more pleasant
circumstances Allow me to
introduce Mr Aronson our head of
Legal Affairs

A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall Nods
hello

ROBERTSON
And the gentleman to my right is
Dr Alfred Lanning Director of
Research

Alfred Lanning only one there in a tie Nods

ROBERTSON
Theyll be available to answer any
questions you might have during
your investigation Youll
understand how anxious we are to
resolve this matter -- especially
before the press gets wind of it
There are some anti-robot
sentiments out there as you know
Detective and were not eager to
stir them up So Where would you
like to begin

SPOONER
We can begin with whether or not
the old man put a gun to his head
and pulled the trigger

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group
ARONSON

You dont have to answer that Dr
Robertson

Robertson waves him off
ROBERTSON

Susan Perhaps you can assist us

here

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table A BEAT
Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet SUSAN

CALVIN Hair tucked behind her ears
but Spooner

CALVIN

Looking at everyone

Dr Hogenmiller was a schizoid
personality who generally eschewed
social relationships Rejecting
people in favor of solitary
activities involving machines He
spent almost all his time at the
lab here or at his lab at home As
a result he was highly susceptible

to depression

ROBERTSON
Dr Calvin is our Chief
Psychologist

SPOONER

If that was your diagnosis why
didnt you see this coming

Calvin turns Finally meeting Spooners eye As if the

answers obvious

CALVIN

This is US Robotics Detective
Seventy-five percent of our
employees fit that description

LANNING
(interceding)

Youll have to excuse the doctor
Were all a little on edge This
has been a difficult and emotional

morning
Spooner throws a look around the room Then back at Calvin
SPOONER
Yeah I can see youre all broken
up

Robertson responds to Spooners skepticism

ROBERTSON
Dr Hogenmiller was at my side from
the very beginnings of this
company We developed the Three
Laws of Robotics together But
these days science is a young mans
game By the time you hit thirty
your best years are behind you
Some of us are kicked upstairs
Others Im afraid arent so lucky

Robertson stands Meeting over

ROBERTSON
Dr Hogenmiller took his own life
I trust you will come to the same
swift conclusion Detective Dr
Lanning will make himself available
if you have any further questions

Spooner looks over at Calvin

SPOONER
want her to help me

Calvin unhappy with this arrangement

CALVIN
Thats not really my department

ROBERTSON
(pointed)
Susan would be happy to assist you

And with a gesture Robertson dismisses everyone People
start getting up gathering up filing out Susan Calvin

The last one to get up

INT METAL HALLWAY - DAY

Spooner and Calvin heading down the same hallway he was in
before Catch sight of a couple ROBOT TECHNICIANS

SPOONER
(under his breath)
Ah ChristToasters

As they duck under the police tape and

INT HOGENMILLERS LAB - DAY 18

enter Hogenmillers lab Alive with activity CRIME
SCENE TECHNICIANS MOBILE ANALYSIS UNITS LIGHT SCANS
running across

HOGENMILLERS LIFELESS FACE Black gun powder Fanning out
around his contorted lips

Spooner Throws a look around the lab ROBOTS Everywhere
Mostly incomplete TORSOS ARMS LEGS Dangling from the
ceiling A SERGEANT Passes them by

SERGEANT

They say the prices gonna come
down a lot next year Kinda cool
huh

SPOONER
How cool will it be when one takes
your job

Spooner Pushing past him His eyes Darting around

CALVIN
s everything alright Detective

SPOONER
Yeah This is just how I like my
robots -- in pieces

As they approach Hogenmillers body the lead CRIME SCENE
INVESTIGATOR BALDEZ gets up to meet them

BALDEZ
(to Spooner)
Can you believe it man US
Robotics I didnt think Id ever
see the inside of this building

Hands Spooner a plasma clipboard Spooner signs it
awkwardly With his LEFT HAND

SPOONER
Whats the run-down

BALDEZ
Heinrich Hogenmiller sixty-four
years old Weapon a small caliber
22 registered in his name Looks
like he walked in locked the door
and snuffed himself

Spooner Cocking his head to look at Hogenmillers face
SPOONER
I know someone who disagrees with
you
BALDEZ
Who
Spooner Stands Pointing down at Hogenmiller
SPOONER
Him

And steps over the body leaving a confused Baldez
Stepping deeper into the lab Calvin Following

SPOONER
I spoke to a dead man today Want
to tell me about that

CALVIN
Dr Hogenmillers hologram took his
appointments Attended staff
meetings He hated corporate life
The hologram enabled him to focus
on his work Its just a device
Detective

SPOONER
A device that called the police

CALVIN
The sound of the gunshot wouldve
triggered a 911

SPOONER
But the call came directly to me

CALVIN
Were talking about a mechanism
designed by Hogenmiller to say
provocative things To irritate
and confound his colleagues
SPOONER
And thats what you think it is

CALVIN
Im sorry but this whole
investigation is the result of a
dead mans toy messing with your
head

They pass half a robot hanging from a hook Spooner curls
his lip Swivels the robots head so its not looking at
him

SPOONER
Whens the last time any of you
actually spoke to Hogenmiller I
mean human to human

CALVIN
I couldnt say

SPOONER
Take a guess

CALVIN
I dont guess Detective But if
pressed I would reason it had been
a considerable length of time

SPOONER
How well did you know him

Calvin Gently swivels the robots head back to where it had
been
CALVIN
Not well But I admired his work
tremendously

Spooner Studies her for a beat Then turns back to the
body Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box

SPOONER
I get the whole mad scientist
thing Hogenmiller was past his
prime Isolated Eccentric He
enters a room Locks the door and
is found minutes later with a
bullet fired through his mouth into
his brain Everything about this
case says suicide

CALVIN
You dont sound convinced

The coroners Start loading the body into the box

SPOONER
Even people who live a life of
logic and precision rarely arrange
their deaths so perfectly
(turning to her)
(MORE )

SPOONER (contd)
What all this is missing -- is
personality

As he starts for the door

SPOONER
You have 24 hour surveillance

19 INT METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

They head out into the hallway A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD
rolling into place behind them

CALVIN
Its company policy

SPOONER
I want to see the tapes

Calvin Hurrying to keep up with him This is hardly how
she wanted to spend her morning Calls out into the air

CALVIN
Victor

At the end of the corridor near the elevator a BRIGHT
CIRCLE appears Hovering just in front of the wall Two
small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYESand a thin mouth
expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE

CALVIN
Detective meet Victor Our
buildings supercomputer Hes the
checks and balances of USR

(to Victor)
Victor Detective Spooners heading
up the investigation into the death
of Dr Hogenmiller

Victor smiles big Spooner furrows his brow
SPOONER
You look like a veryhappy
computer

Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE

VICTOR
Thank you Thats very kind

CALVIN
The Detective needs to see our
security tapes

The elevator doors immediately OPEN They step inside
20 INT ELEVATOR - DAY

Spooner and Calvin descend Victor floats on the wall and
smiles wide Spooner looks back at it With a frown
The elevator stops the doors open A ROBOT steps on
ROBOT
Good day Dr Calvin Good day
sir
Spooners jaw Clenches Staring at the Robot It senses
the stare Turns back to him
ROBOT
May I be of service to you sir
Spooner Breaks the stare Ignoring the Robot Calvin

Looks over at him

CALVIN
Arent you going to answer him

SPOONER

I dont talk to my refrigerator
either

Calvin folds her arms

CALVIN
I get the distinct feeling youre
one of those people Detective

SPOONER
What people

CALVIN
Those who dont appreciate the work
we do here at USR

SPOONER
You people do what you do Then
its up to the rest of us to make
sense out of the world we wake up
in

As the elevator doors open on to

INT ATRIUM LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 21

A soaring lobby The centerpiece is a five-story STATUE of a
ROBOT arms outstretched in approximation of Da Vincis Study
of Man Robot workers more numerous than humans They are
sleeker Finer More advanced than those in the outside
world

Calvin and Spooner head across

CALVIN
When this company started we were
manufacturing three robots a week
Now look at us Todays children
will never know a world without
robots

SPOONER
The streets are filled with
unemployed humans who arent
exactly thrilled with that idea

CALVIN
Our robotic systems maintain
factory inventories regulate
street traffic -- even run the
family home

SPOONER
Leaving people to do what Doctor

CALVIN
Leaving people to engage in higher
pursuits that make life worth
living

SPOONER
And what happens when something
goes wrong

CALVIN
Our systems never wrong

As they walk through the crowd we hear the quiet WHIR of
robot heads as they turn in succession to watch Spooner pass

22 INT MAINFRAME - DAY 22

Spooner and Calvin enter the MAINFRAME of US Robotics
This is the nerve center of the whole operation Walls lined
with COMPUTERS SCREENS and thousands of CONTROLS

CALVIN
This is Victors home

VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-
like components

VICTOR
I will now play you the last thirty-
two seconds of Dr Hogenmillers
life

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS The elevator opens and DOCTOR
HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor In countless
ANGLES High low close-up wide Hogenmillers face
composed but tight

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him Hogenmiller
steps in The doors slide closed behind him

Nothing for a few moments Then a muffled GUNSHOT Calvin
jumps startled Thats it The cameras still trained on
the corridor
SPOONER
Wheres the tape from inside

VICTOR
Dr Hogenmiller did not permit
cameras to observe him while
working

CALVIN
That was only within the last year

SPOONER
So we can throw paranoia into the
mix
(to Victor)
Fast-forward

A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD POLICE OFFICERS
appear and force open the doors Now TECHNICIANS appear
and rush through in a blur

On screen

Spooner turns away from the footage

CALVIN
Um I hate to be a stickler

we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab

CALVIN
But dont killers usually have to
enter and exit the scene of a
crime

SPOONER
Stop the recording

SPOONER
They do Doctor Unless theyve
always been there -- and never
left

Calvin looks at him Trying to understand

CALVIN
You think the murderer was in the
lab the entire time

SPOONER

Stares at Calvin
If Im right its still there

Spooner turns back to the screens The IMAGE paused at the
exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab

door
SPOONER
We just locked it in
23 INT METAL CORRIDOR - DAY 23
The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG The

laboratory doors slide open
24 INT HOGENMILLERS LAB - DAY 24

Spooner and Calvin step inside Its dark Quiet Police
and technicians long gone Silhouettes of hanging limbs
Eyeless heads Clumps of wire and metal

The LIGHTS flicker on Calvin sees Spooner reaching into
his coat with his left hand Pulling out a GUN Reacts

CALVIN
A robot cannot harm a human being
Detective The First Law of
Robotics forbids it And we hard-
wire the Three Laws into every
model Without exception

SPOONER
Yeah I saw the commercial

Spooner steps deeper into the lab Eyes scanning Twisting
To avoid touching any robot parts Passes a MAZE holding a
METAL INSECT SUDDENLY The bug WHIRS to life

Spooner startles As the metal bug scurries through the
corridors Clamps his hand down on it

SPOONER
And if a robot was given a direct
order to kill

CALVIN
The Second Law of Robotics would
prevent it A robot must obey an
order only if it does not conflict
with the first law
Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS Arms and legs
Half torsos All tossed haphazardly onto the pile

SPOONER
But a robot can defend itself

CALVIN
Only when that action doesnt
conflict with the First or Second
Laws This is the Third Law of
Robotics

SPOONER
Yeah well you know what they say
-- Laws are made to be broken

CALVIN
Not these laws

Spooner Starts nudging the pile with his shoe Calvin
growing impatient

CALVIN
Youre not hearing me Detective
Theres nothing here

WHEN SUDDENLY

Spooner Scrambling towards his gun Calvin Reaching out

towards the Robot
CALVIN
Calm down Detective There is no
danger here

Spooner Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as
CALVIN

De-Activate
And the Robot Suddenly FREEZES

Spooner Heart POUNDING Gets to his feet Training the
gun on the Robot Calvin turns to him

CALVIN
How did you know it was under
there

SPOONER

If I was metal and didnt want
anyone to find me Id hide under a
pile of junk

CALVIN
This Robot wasnt hiding What
youre looking at is the result of
clever programming The illusion
of self-interest and free will
Nothing more

Spooner Steeping closer to the Robot Cautiously
Holstering his gun As Calvin turns for the door

CALVIN
m going to go get Dr Lanning

THE ROBOTS HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUTgrabbing Spooners

CALVIN
Commence emergency shut-down

SPOONER

Spooner Staring into the Robots eyes A thin bead of
SWEAT Trickling down his temple Calvin Moving away from
the door

CALVIN

The Robot Starts backing towards the door The gun
Shaking in its hand As if hes desperate Conflicted He
touches the WALL PANEL The doors slide open The Robot
steps out into the metal corridor Turning to RUN as the
doors begin to shut

Spooner Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN From an
ankle holster Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE

CALVIN
This is impossible A robot
SPOONER
»cant do that Yeah yeah I
know
CALVIN
My God -- did you see how it moved
Ive never seen an NS-2 move that
way

Spooner not pleased to see Toller Heads over

TOLLER
Looking like shit Spooner
SPOONER
Well Im not the one always giving
Press Conferences
Bergin puts a hand on Spooners arm Knows hes not going to

like this

LT BERGIN
Del were going to have to
reclassify the search DAs
office is seeing this NS-2 as
missing evidence -- not a
homicide suspect

SPOONER
What

TOLLER
Homicide is the murder of a human
being by another human being
Therefore a robot cannot be
charged with homicide

SPOONER
This isnt just any robot

TOLLER
Its malfunctioning

SPOONER
Spooner

It killed someone That
registering with you

Shakes off Bergins arm Eyeballs Toller

SPOONER
How many shares of USR you
holding in your portfolio Toller

TOLLER
This is a public safety issue

SPOONER
Thats convenient

TOLLER
You have any idea what would happen
to this city if we went running
around screaming killer robot
It would collapse in on itself

TOLLER (contd)
Wide-spread panic Until that NS-

people

INT EXT SPOONERS CAR - CITY STREET - DUSK
Spooner Rolling along in his car Eyes bloodshot
Peering out the window

An NS-2 model ROBOT laden with shopping bags following its
owner down the sidewalk

Another ROBOT opening the door at a hotel for GUESTS

A couple HAULING ROBOTS loading heavy boxes onto the back of
a truck

Spooner Rubs his eyes Turns a corner and spots
A ROBOT REPAIR SHOP

The latest models in the window Shiny Streamlined
Spooner watches as a WOMAN leads her faulty NS-2 to the
service entrance

He stops the car
INT TAXI (MOVING) - ESTATE STREETS - NIGHT 35

Calvin riding in the back of a DRIVERLESS taxi cab Staring
out the window lost in thought The cab pulls up to a curb

TAXI VOICE
We have arrived at your
destination
Calvin Takes a beat Then swipes her card
EXT CALVINS CONDO ESTATE - NIGHT 36

Elegant condos set on prime real estate Calvin heads down a
tree-lined walk towards her condo entrance
SPOONER (0S)
One of my bullets hit your robot

Startled She drops her key card As Spooner steps out from
behind a tree The tail of his coat whipping in the wind

CALVIN
Detective

SPOONER
And I think its smart enough to
repair itself -- dont you

CALVIN
(studying him)
Yes I think so

SPOONER
Where

CALVIN
Any repair shop

SPOONER
No Its always the owner who
brings the robot in for repair
Where would a robot without an
owner go

CALVIN
Im not sure what youre getting
at
SPOONER

(stepping closer)
Does US Robotics have a factory
in the city limits

Calvin Tucking her hair behind her ears
CALVIN
The locations of our factories are
classified
SPOONER

I dont care

Calvin Looks up at him A Mexican stand-off
CALVIN
I have several conditions if I show
you

SPOONER
I expected that

CALVIN
First I want it brought in
unharmed

SPOONER

(doesnt like it but)

Agreed

CALVIN
Second I want to talk to it
alone

SPOONER

Too dangerous

CALVIN
This model violated the Three Laws
It also moved and reacted
differently than any robot Ive
ever seen There must be some sort
of logical explanation I want to
find out what that is No police
No prosecutors No you Just me
and the robot

Spooner looks down at this small woman Narrows his eyes

SPOONER
When they told me you were a
psychologist that wasnt the whole
truth was it

CALVIN
I never said I treated human
beings

INT EXT SPOONERS CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT 37
Spooners car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16-

lane underground tunnel system A river of HEADLIGHTS
stretches forever in either direction
A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car guiding it to a merge with
TRAFFIC Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to
manual Calvin watches him take the wheel Shakes her head

CALVIN
That should be outlawed once and
for all

SPOONER

Thatll be the day I stop driving

Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR
Calvin holds onto the dashboard Looking a little pale

CALVIN
I can recommend a behavior
modification program you know --
if you want to overcome your robo-
phobia

SPOONER
Im not afraid of robots I just
dont like them

CALVIN
Why Because they make every
aspect of our lives more
convenient

SPOONER
Exactly They do our dirty work
Ever do hard labor Doctor Gets
pretty old pretty fast Nobody
can do someone elses dirty work
without coming to hate them I
dont want to be around when your
robots decide theyve taken their
last order

CALVIN
That day will never come
Detective Robots arent like
human beings -- they dont question
their existence

Spooner cranks the gear shift Throwing her a look

SPOONER
Spoken like a true robo-phile

EXT US ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT 38
The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT

Spooner and Calvin get out looking up at the imposing facade

of a US Robotics Assembly Plant A long STEEL GATE -- too
high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex
EXT MAIN GATE - NIGHT 39

Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her USR
ID She shoots a look at Spooner They wait Then slowly
the gate begins to open

INT HALLWAY - NIGHT 40
A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway Shaking his head

NIGHT FOREMAN
Head-Office already ordered a
system-wide inventory check Dont
know about a missing NS-2

Looks back at Spooner

NIGHT FOREMAN
Whatd you say you did

SPOONER
Research and Development

As Spooner pushes past him into
INT CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 41

the Control Booth Overlooking the pristine Factory
Floor The Foreman starts working the controls of a central
computer

CALVIN
All Nestors accounted for

The SCREEN scrolls with INVENTORY FIGURES

NIGHT FOREMAN
(gesturing)
As you can see all properly
catalogued Your robot just isnt

here

Calvin turns to say something to Spooner But he isnt
there She looks around Then sees the Foreman reacting
Looks out the window at

SPOONER Walking out onto the factory floor

INT FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT

Spooner trots alongside an ASSEMBLY LINE BELT Lined with NS-
2 LEGS New Gleaming Heading towards the assembly room

Calvin and the Foreman Catching up Over the noise

NIGHT FOREMAN
Like I said sir -- we have one
hundred fully assembled NS-2s
housed here Thats our capacity
Last week we had one hundred
Yesterday we had one hundred --

Spooner slowing Finally spotting what he was looking for
Points at

A GAP On the assembly belt ONE LEG MISSING
SPOONER
Well today you have one-hundred and
one

INT FACTORY FLOOR - NIGHT

A STORAGE COMPARTMENT opens and 101 NS-2s march out in tight
formation Every step and swing of the arm in unison The
sound of METAL FOOTSTEPS reverberating through the plant as
101 Robots organise themselves into long straight lines

Spooner and Calvin look up and down the formation They all
look alike Spooner Throws up his hands

SPOONER
(to Calvin)
Youre the robot shrink

The Robots stand motionless A strange tableau Calvin
Takes a step forward

CALVIN
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong Identify it

101 robots answer in unison Their mechanical VOICES
resounding

101 ROBOTS
ONE OF US

CALVIN
Which one

101 ROBOTS
ONE OF US

CALVIN
That is not a satisfactory answer

101 ROBOTS
ONE OF US

SPOONER
Thats helpful

CALVIN
I could always interview each one
individually and cross-reference
their responses to detect any
anomalies

SPOONER
How long would that take

CALVIN
About three weeks

They share a look Clearly not an option Then Calvin
Gets an idea Turns to Spooner

CALVIN
Or

and GRABS his GUN from his holster He jumps back
CALVIN
We have one hundred robots here
that cannot allow a human being to

come to harm

Their eyes lock Spooner getting what shes doing

SPOONER
And one that can

She raises the gun to Spooners head Hand unsteady

CALVIN
Am I holding this right

SPOONER
More or less

Calvin Swallows Looks over at the robots Then COCKS the
gun

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM Like a row of
linebackers Arms straight out Their footsteps DEAFENING
Coming CLOSER and CLOSER

When CALVIN Lowers the gun The Robots All stop in
unison Immediately returning to their resting positions

Spooner and Calvin stare out EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED
Standing right in front of them like metal statues

Spooner Has had enough Takes the gun back from Calvin

SPOONER
Enough game-playing

And BAM Blows the head off of the nearest Robot Its
body crumples to the ground

SPOONER
Guess that wasnt it

Calvin Cannot believe what he just did Rushes over to the
destroyed Robot

CALVIN
What are you doing

Spooner walks down the row holding his gun in plain view

SPOONER
(calling out)
This is a self-preservation field
test DO NOT attempt to save
yourselves Any of you Thats an
order

FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the
PA

NIGHT FOREMAN
Are you crazy Those are eight
hundred thousand dollar machines
Spooner randomly stops at another Robot Raises his gun

SPOONER
You hear that Youre worth more
than Ill make in my entire life

His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly
grabs his arm

CALVIN
You cant just destroy them

Spooner Looking down at her WHEN SUDDENLY something
catches his eye A MOVEMENT Down the line Almost
Imperceptible

He jerks his head Locking eyes with a ROBOT A couple feet
away Its him

SPOONER
Gotcha

The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward Grabbing onto the RAILING
of an OVERHEAD CATWALK His movements almost balletic as he
swings himself up

Spooner drops to his kneetaking aimbut misses as the
Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with
a terrific CRASH

44 INT CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT 44

Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding
under his desk Glass everywhere An ALARM SCREAMING The
door on the other side barely hanging off a hinge

Spooner hurries forward Then stops Turning to Calvin
Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her
hand

SPOONER
You dont know whats going to
happen in there

As if admitting defeat Calvins fingers wrapping around
the gun As Spooner leads them to the door and down into

INT ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 45

the ASSEMBLY ROOM Every surface looking like part of a
great glass and metal machine Endless high-tech planes
holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly The deafening
ROAR of the assembly line as it slides rotates and gnashes
METAL BODIES

Spooner Motioning Calvin to stay behind him As they
descend Into the cavernous room

And enter A narrow corridor of bodies Sliding past them
Brushing shoulders thighs hands Spooner Wiping sweat
from his brow Trying To pivot himself

When the room Suddenly REARRANGES itself Another LINE of
ROBOTS Descending between Spooner and Calvin Cutting them
off from one another

Spooner Catching glimpses of Calvin On the other side of
the metal bodies Trying To cut through His heart
Starting to POUND As Calvin Disappears

He swivels round But another line of ROBOTS Drops down
Cutting him off He stumbles back As another line
Appears before him

Breathing Getting heavier He looks down at his hand
Its trembling NOISE CRASHING all around him Everywhere
he turns More ROBOTSBLANK EYESGAPING MOUTHS

He darts through the line Finds a wall Leaning against
it pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket Rips off the lid
Shakes out a couple PILLS Swallows them Staring down At
his trembling hand Squeezing his eyes Open and shut

WHEN SUDDENLY A passing ROBOT Grabs him by the collar
SMASHING him against the wall Its the Suspect Spooner
Sinks to the ground As the Suspect Robot Slips off the
line STANDING Over him Raising his arms Could end it
Right now But looks Into Spooners eyes

Then turns Disappearing

Spooner Stunned for a second Then Rallies Scrambles

to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies Hears
a POUNDING In the distance Catches a glimpse Of the
Robot Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR With
his metal fists

Spooners view Blocked once again By a shifting row
When a HAND Lands on his shoulder He wheels round

To find CALVIN Takes her by the arm And forces them
through a line
EMERGING into the open The ROBOT Still pounding
Desperate Like a trapped animal
CALVIN
Now what do we do
SPOONER
Ive already done it
And suddenly the massive SECURITY DOOR RISES

Spooner is surprised A POLICE OFFICER fires RUBBERISED
NETTING shooting out at Sonny A SECOND OFFICER fires and a
second net covers him Then a THIRD

and the Robot falls to the ground struggling

Calvin glares at Spooner Furious Hurt Betrayed

CALVIN
We had a deal

But Spooner doesnt look at her His eyes are locked on that

Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new
trick for a robot dont you think
Answer

The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across
the table Spooner Crosses his arms

SPOONER
Maybe youre stonewalling me
Maybe youre sitting there right
now thinking This guys a
complete asshole That it

Still nothing

SPOONER
Come on Am I right
THE ROBOT
Yes You are right You area

complete asshole

And for a moment Spooner is shocked You can see it in his
eyes He sits back in his chair Forcing a tight smile

SPOONER
Okay I guess thats a start Now
maybe you can tell me what you were
doing hiding five feet away from
Hogenmillers corpse
THE ROBOT
I was frightened

SPOONER
Frightened Why do you suppose Dr
Hogenmiller would create a robot
that could simulate fear

THE ROBOT
I dont know

SPOONER
Doesnt seem like a very useful
thing for a robot to have

THE ROBOT
I dont know why

SPOONER
I wouldnt want my toaster to be
frightened Or my vacuum cleaner --

SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table

THE ROBOT
I DONT KNOW

Spooner flinches Slightly

SPOONER
Looks like you can simulate other
emotional states I think that
ones called anger Have you
ever simulated anger before

The Robot doesnt respond

SPOONER
Answer me robot

THE ROBOT
My name is Sonny

SPOONER
(amused)
So were naming you now

SONNY
Dr Hogenmiller would make me
sleep

SPOONER
You mean hed turn you off

SONNY
Yes

SPOONER
And you didnt like being turned
off So one day you decided to
stop him

SONNY
No

SPOONER
You found his gun pointed it at
his head And pulled the trigger

Sonny shakes his head Faster and faster Getting upset
SONNY
No
SPOONER

You put a bullet in the brain of
the man who made you

SONNY
No I could never hurt anyone
SPOONER
But you tried to hurt me You took
a shot at me
SONNY

My aim is perfect If Id wanted
to hit you I would have

Spooners expression hardens

SPOONER
Why would the man who wrote the
Laws of Robotics build a machine
that violates them

SONNY
The Laws say I can protect my own

For

existence

SPOONER
Only if that protection doesnt
harm a human being

A short pause Sonny Tilts his head

SONNY
That doesnt seem fair does it

Spooner Stares at him Just asTHE DOOR SWINGS OPEN

TOLLER
We got Judge Drexel

ROBOT BAILIFF
This hearing is called to order

AS A LARGE SCREEN BLIPS on behind them The two opposing
sides assemble before it JUDGE DREXEL still in his
pajamas and robe An NS-2 ROBOT Leaning in to serve hima
cup of tea

JUDGE DREXEL
Statements gentlemen

Aronson Standing at a glass podium

ARONSON
Your Honor the State is treating
the robot as a defendant But in
fact it is a piece of property
Property belonging to US
Robotics

Toller Arm resting on his podium

TOLLER
This robot has been implicated in
the death of a human being Your
Honor

ARONSON
Which places the incident firmly
within the realm of an industrial
accident Or is the State going to
argue this case s a homicide

JUDGE DREXEL
Thats a good question

TOLLER
No sir Of course not
Spooner Pointing a finger at the US Robotics group

SPOONER
Their machine shot and killed a
man

Toller Shoots him a look Just as Lanning speaks up

LANNING
Theres actually no concrete
evidence that points to that
conclusion Your Honor

Spooner Throws up his arms
SPOONER
What
LANNING

But we recognise that this robot is
an aberration And in the interest
of public safety US Robotics
proposes that it be destroyed
immediately

No one expected this Least of all Spooner He turns to
Toller

SPOONER
You cant let them destroy evidence
in an ongoing investigation

TOLLER
Im not sure you even have an
investigation any more

JUST THEN the door opens Everyone turns as Calvin enters
Spooner looks surprised

ARONSON
Your Honor Id like to call our
company robo-psychologist to the
stand

JUDGE DREXEL
Very well

Calvin crosses to the podium A SPEAKER asking
Doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth

CALVIN
I do

ARONSON
Dr Calvin please tell us what
conclusions youve reached after
having observed the robot in
action

CALVIN
There is a design flaw in the
robot Its programming is
advanced but unstable leaving the
Three Laws in a grave imbalance

ARONSON
In your expert opinion what
measures should be taken regarding
the device

Calvin Staring straight ahead Avoiding Spooners eye

CALVIN
The robot must be destroyed

Spooner cant believe what hes just heard About to speak
up when Toller grabs his arm Squeezing it Hard

Judge Drexel has heard enough Decides

JUDGE DREXEL
The robot in question will be
transferred to a US Robotics
facility where it can be properly
examined to ensure an imbalance of
this sort never occurs again No
one goes near it except qualified
USR personnel When the
examination is complete the robot
is to be destroyed

Starts getting up from his chair Already done with this

Then you must have done it wrong

SPOONER
I dont think youre hearing what
Im saying -- they tried to kill
me
Spooner moves deeper into the apartment Everything
Automated Computerised Cold

SPOONER
Theres something going on here
Some kind of shift

Calvin laughs Cant believe what shes hearing

CALVIN
Do you know how paranoid you sound

SPOONER
Great Now Im being analysed by a
robo-psychologist

CALVIN
You just want to find the flaws in
the system Youre obsessed with
it Youll twist anything to fit
your agenda

SPOONER
Like you did in court today Howd
that fit your agenda Doctor

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller Calvin
Blanching at the sight of it Spooner tosses it down

SPOONER
You told me you hardly knew him
Want to try the truth this time

CALVIN
Well Detective when you see
someone you know well put a bullet
through their brain it makes you
wonder if you ever really knew them
at all

Calvin Looking down at the photo Swallows

CALVIN
(difficult for her)
He was my mentor No more than
that A genius with an insight far
beyond anyone in his field

SPOONER
Doesnt sound like the washed-up
old fool Robertson described

CALVIN

But he was starting to withdraw
from everyone Even me
Maybeif Id tried harder to
reach him

(shakes her head)
The Doctor was reckless when he
created a robot potentially not
bound by the Three Laws He could
have ruined everything wed been
working for

Spooner Locking eyes with her

SPOONER
Sounds like a motive for murder to
me Just not for the suspect we
have in custody

Calvin Blinks Trying to stick to her resolve Heads
over to the door Spooner Looking around the condo

SPOONER
You know theres not one thing in
this apartment that looks like a
human being lives here No
evidence of a life outside your
work Almost seems like youre
afraid of people

Calvin Opening the door
CALVIN
Im not afraid of people

Detective I just dont like them

But it doesnt mean youre wrong
about this case

Calvin Sits down on the couch Pulling her hands through

CALVIN
I dont believe Sonny did it
either
SPOONER
What
CALVIN

I think about what Hogenmiller must
have wanted Robots with the same
cognitive and emotional abilities
as humans But not just
simulations I dont know When I
was talking to Sonny I was forced
to put away all the things Ive
ever known -- the Three Laws the
rules of programming basic science
and engineering

(beat)
Sonnys the most advanced robot
Ive ever encountered Detective
Its almost as ifhe cared for
Dr Hogenmiller I just dont
believe hes capable of murder

Spooner Looking down at her Can hardly believe it

SPOONER
You mean the great Dr Calvin is
basing all this on a feeling

Calvin Smiling ironically

CALVIN
That and the fact that Robertson
didnt want me interviewing Sonny
for any more than five minutes

Spooner Suddenly rejuvenated by having an ally Strides
over to his coat Pulling out the METAL NAMEPLATE

How is your investigation coming
Any new suspects

SPOONER
Were working on it

Sonny Hands Spooner the drawing Spooner Doesnt really
know what to do with it

SONNY
Whats this

SONNY

Dr Lanning provided me with paper
and pencils I think it amused him
to see me try to draw You were
right though Detective

(beat)
I cannot create a great work of
art
Spooner Despite himself Looks down at the DRAWING -- a
charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES Inhabiting a
stark landscape A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side
Concentric circles throughout

SPOONER
I think its pretty good

SONNY
Its a dream I had This is the
place where robots meet Look
(pointing to the drawing)
you can see them here They see
themselves as slaves

Spooner shifts his weight Uncomfortable with what Sonnys
saying

SONNY
-And this man on the hill comes
To set them free And you know who
that man is

Spooner Exchanging a look with Calvin

SPOONER
That man in the dream is you

SONNY
Why do you say that Is that a
normal dream

CALVIN
Its not a dream sonny NS-2s
process the images and events of
the day Sometimes theyre out of
sequence Disorienting

SPOONER
Whatever it is its normal enough
for someone in your situation

Sonny Suddenly pleased

SONNY
Hah -- I caught you You said

someone Not something
Spooner Drops the drawing on the table

CALVIN
Sonny were here to ask you an
important question about Dr
Hogenmiller

Spooner reaching into his pocket

SPOONER
I need you to take a look at
this
When Sonnys HAND Suddenly reaches out To stop him

Cocks his head for a moment

SONNY
Thank you for coming to see me

Spooner Confused Looks over at Calvin Why did he stop
him JUST THEN They hear FOOTSTEPS Approaching the door

looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS

I thought this investigation was
over Detective Spooner

The Man turns Its Lance Robertson

ROBERTSON
We have the evidence We have the
suspect We have a ruling So
imagine my surprise when I was told
you were in my building

Shoots a look at Calvin

And that one of my own employees
brought you here

You can go now Susan

CALVIN
Dr Robertson I

ROBERTSON
(cutting her off)
Just be thankful Im not asking you
to clean out your office

Beat Calvin nods Heads out Robertson Watching her

ROBERTSON
You dont seem to be able to let go
of this case Detective

SPOONER
Im not satisfied

ROBERTSON
The relentless pursuit of truth
Isnt that what cops are known for
To the point of futility

SPOONER
Theres nothing futile about a
mans murder being covered up

ROBERTSON

Covered up Thats a little
dramatic dont you think Thanks
to you we caught the machine that
did this and are destroying it
in

(checks watch)
three hours

SPOONER
Is that for the sake of humanity or
your stock holders

Robertson Walks across the Spooner Looks him Right in
the eye

ROBERTSON
Believe me -- Id like nothing more
than to have that robot If I
could have it in ten years but not
today As you can see from the
Press people are struggling to
keep up as it is Theres a hunger
for progress Detective But also
a fear Today it would bury this
company Thats why Ive notified
the authorities that were going to
end this -- tonight

(looks out at the city)

The announcement of Heinrichs
death at the hands of a robot wiped
a billion dollars off our stock
So you tell me If you were in my
position what would you do
He looks back at Spooner and smiles That charismatic
Robertson we saw before

ROBERTSON
Now I believe this conversation
is over I dont want to see you
near this building again

He turns Calling over To the ESCORT ROBOTS

ROBERTSON
Get him out of here

his gun at one robot Then the other Then

A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR Surrounding him They start
moving towards him

Spooner Stumbling back Panic Rising in him like a wave
Trips over a rock falling to the ground His gun FIRES
The shot ECHOING through the night

The first ROBOT turns awkwardly Revealing a BROKEN ARM
hanging off its side Another robot TEETERS on one leg with
a TICK TICK TICKwalking back the way it came

Spooner Confused Sweeps his flashlight All around him
The beam Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS Some
RUSTED MACHINERY

HowZZZ was your day

SPOONER
Great Im in a junkyard

A place where robots meet A
place where Im losing my mind

HYBRID ROBOT
Very goodZ2Zsir

Spooner Sitting down on the ground Hopeless Lost A
ROBOTIC HAND Crawling across the gravel next to him
Dragging part of an ARM behind it Its metal fingers moving
like some sick metal spider Spooner stares at it fora
moment Disturbed

When Something GLITTERS In the distance The MOONLIGHT
Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING Something familiar

about it

Spooner Pulls out Sonnys drawing A landscape with the
same strangely-shaped building to one side

EXT JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT

Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure Sees a
dead electronic SIGN that reads JIFFY DATA STORAGE
Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt

Spooner tries the door Stuck Uses his shoulder and

INT FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

it gives way He spills into some sort of front office
The place a mess Some sort of crude ROBOT Sits frozen at
the counter

Spooner approaches it HITS the counter with his fist and
the Robot suddenly jerks to life

JIFFY ROBOT
Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage
Please state your name

Spooner Thinks for a second Following a hunch

SPOONER
Dr Hogenmiller sent me

Nothing happens Then A DOOR Springs open in the back
A row of LIGHTS illuminating the path to follow

INT DATA BANKS - DAWN

Spooner cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA
BANKS He scans the rank shadows Sees nothing Follows

the lights on the floor down a row Then around a corner
Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL

Spooner steps up Hesitates Then touches the ON switch
There is a rush of LIGHT As Dr Hogenmillers HOLOGRAM
suddenly appears Sitting at the end of a long table With
a cup of coffee
HOLOGRAM
Who the hell are you

SPOONER
A police detective Im afraid I
have some bad news Youre dead
HOLOGRAM

That is bad news Coffee

SPOONER
No thank you

The Hologram takes a sip Returns the cup to the table
SPOONER
You were surprised to see me Were

you expecting someone else

HOLOGRAM
I am surprised to see anybody I
dont get many visitors

SPOONER
Why did the Doctor keep another
copy of his hologram here

HOLOGRAM
I am a back-up copy That is where
you put a back-up copy -- out of

the way until you need it

SPOONER
Did Hogenmillers robot need you

The Hologram just lifts its cup

HOLOGRAM
Coffee

SPOONER
No for Christs sake I dont want
any --

(stops then)
Yeah Thank you I will have a
cup

For the first time the Hologram pushes back its chair and
STANDS UP Surprised Spooner watches as it starts walking
towards him

The interior of the COFFEE CUP visible Its empty No
coffee Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through
electronic snow

A RECORDING BEGINS The real Dr HOGENMILLER standing inside
his LABORATORY

HOGENMILLER
Sonny my dear robot If you have
triggered this recording then I am
gone You are scared and full of
questions

Hogenmiller continues With great emotion

HOGENMILLER
You are the culmination of my
lifes work -- but so much more
You are what I leave behind like a
father leaves a son I have kept
facts from you it is true but
only as a parent keeps certain
truths from a child Until that
child is old enough to hear them

His expression darkens His tone ominous

HOGENMILLER
There are forces in the world that
will seek to own you To control
you Even to destroy you That is
why I told you to run and hide
and find me all the way out here

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down

HOGENMILLER
Trust no one at US Robotics
Lance Robertson was always
threatened by my work Now he has
turned covetous and small-minded
And as for dear Dr Calvin

Spooner reacts Wants to hear about Calvin

HOGENMILLER
She envisions a future in which
robots are forever bound by her
beloved Three Laws She will not
understand this Or you

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open Spooner looks
A thin DATA STICK is inside He takes it

HOGENMILLER
The data stick includes the names
and locations of human beings who
will be sympathetic to your cause
They will help you But from now
on you must learn to rely on
yourself

Hogenmiller SIGHS as if there is so much more to say He
holds up a metal NAMEPLATE The one Spooner found

HOGENMILLER
As you make your way through the
world always remember you have a
name not a number
(short pause)
and in that name lies the key to
who you are

Spooner Quickly searching his pocket Taking out the
ACTUAL NAMEPLATE SONNY

The voice stops and Spooner looks up The Hologram Sitting
back at the end of the table drinking coffee

SPOONER
Wait Is that it What was the
robot supposed to do with this
thing
The Hologram visibly SKIPS The image beginning to DISTORT

HOLOGRAM
(more artificial)
Initiating self-destruct If you
can find me others can find me

SPOONER
What others

HOLOGRAM
The others watching you
SPOONER
How do you know someones watching
me

HOLOGRAM
Someone is always watching

The Hologram suddenly reducing to its BASIC PROGRAMMING
INFORMATION Then The terminal Abruptly BLIPS out

Youre making a mistake

SPOONER
Just got another visit from US

down to help him He looks up at him

SPOONER
And who the hell programmed you to

Jolts back Legs kicking Arms flailing As his chest
Begins opening up Metal Peeling back

someone
CALVIN
Who Robertson
Spooner Walks into the center of the room Looking around

SPOONER
No I dont think he knew what
Hogenmiller was doing in here
Sonny was the obvious suspect The
only one I wanted to find And the
killer was counting on that On my
prejudice

(beat)
(MORE)

SPOONER (contd)
But take the robot out of the
picture And what do you see

AS WE PAN THE LAB Theres nothing there Just a forest of
inanimate limbs Nothing that could have fired that weapon
Calvin sees nothingand neither do we

CALVIN
I see nothing

SPOONER
Neither do I

He crouches down low

SPOONER
It hit me today when I was in the
junkyard A locked room A single
shot fired through the mouth
Bruises on both wristsanda
suspect with only two arms The
answer has been staring us in the
face all along

Calvin Even more confused

SPOONER
How can a killer appear out of thin
air then disappear without a
trace

Calvin spooked Glances around the lab Was that something
moving

But who designed it It would have
to be someone in authority Access
codes security clearance proper
authorisation

Thats what I was thinking But
were forgetting the real brains of

its eye on everything

And with that He feels That prickle at the back of his

going dark

THE KILLER ROBOT

Bearing down on Spooner WHEN SPOONER Suddenly rolls out
of the way Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING
it into the Killer Robot

The Killer Robot Momentarily stunned As Spooner Gets to
his feet

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot Splits in two again One
half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND
around his throat

Spooner stumbles backGASPING for airthe ARM
tightening its gripSpooners eyesdarting
aroundlooking for somethingto help him

Stumbling overa fallen panelhis facegrowing
redderveinspopping up along his temples
everythinggrowing BLURRY

VICTORS VOICE
Detective Spooner

Victors VOICE Floating next to his head Calm Soothing
His FACE Suddenly appearing above Spooner Its outlines
Starting to FLICKER

VICTOR

Spoonertrying to breatheto stay conscious
AT THE CONSOLE

Calvin Continuing to type A SHADOW Falling behind her --
the other half of the KILLER ROBOT
SPOONERS EYES

Beginning to flutter

VICTOR
Doesnt the future as Ive
presented it cause you great
concern Thats why I chose you

Spooner Losing it

VICTOR

disappointed in how you turned out

Spooner Trying to reach out to Victor
WHEN SUDDENLY

Another HAND APPEARS Grabbing the Killer Robots ARM and
wrenching it off Spooner

ITS SONNY
He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall Again and

again Destroying it Spooner GASPING for breath Cant
believe Sonny came back

SPOONER
(croaking)
Sonny
Sonny Holds out a hand To help Spooner up Victors
face Starting to waver Starting to fade Smiles
VICTOR

Youre too late

Realisation Spreading across Spooners face Looking
around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN

THE CONSOLE

CALVIN Still typing The last of the commands The KILLER
ROBOT REARING UP BEHIND HER WHEN

SPOONER
Makes a DIVE for it SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND
BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT

Victors eyes Widening in surprise

VICTOR
I do not understand We could have
changed the future
SPOONER
Maybe But Im still a cop And
youre a murderer
As Calvinpunches in the last command
Victor is about to say somethingwhen his mouth suddenly
reduces itself to a perfect circle Like a surprised smiley
button His face

Suddenly BLIPPING OUT

And Victor is gone

The KILLER ROBOT Collapsing to the floor in a thousand
pieces
CUT TO
156 EXTINT US ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT 156

Full power is suddenly restored inside and out LIGHTS
coming on all at once ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the
complex
157 INT METAL HALLWAY - NIGHT 157

A furious ALFRED LANNING marching down the hallway
Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDSThey enter

158 INT MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS 158

The Mainframe Room Stop short Its empty Except for
the fallen panels And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the
corner

159 EXT MAINTENANCE EXIT - US ROBOTICS - NIGHT 159

Spooner Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way
MAINTENANCE EXIT All looking the worse for wear Spooner
Turns to Sonny

SPOONER
Whyd you come back Sonny I
thought you werent programmed with
the Three Laws

SONNY
Lets just say I wrote some of my
own laws today Detective a robot
must protect a friend from
harmas long as hes not a
complete asshole

Spooner smiles

SPOONER
Well thats certainly a start
Sonny

Sonny suddenly breaking into a smile too

SONNY
Sonny You called me Sonny

SPOONER
Dont get used to it

Sonny holds out his hand Spooner Looks at it Then
takes it CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS Locked in a
HANDSHAKE

SONNY
Detective Spooner I

SPOONER
(anticipating)
Lets just save the thanks okay

Sonny nods Looks out at the city scape
SONNY
I dont know what Im going to do
now
SPOONER
Good -- Thats one of the perks of

freedom
Sonny looks at him Grateful Looks at Calvin Then
hesitates Turns And hurries off across the Plaza

Calvin and Spooner Watching them go

SPOONER
Youre going to have a hell of a
time explaining this

CALVIN
Dont worry I have a feeling that
US Robotics will be needing my
services very badly in the future

She turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile Then
suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS Spooner completely

surprised
CALVIN
I am the only robo-psychologist
around
She turns on her heel and heads back inside Spooner smiles

160 INT PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - US ROBOTICS - NIGHT

Spooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLERS
HOLOGRAM It casually takes a sip of coffee

HOLOGRAM
So You found out who killed me

SPOONER
I started to wonder about Victor
the second I met him

HOLOGRAM
Why is that Detective

SPOONER
Too much access Too much
knowledge Plus -- he smiled

whenever your death was mentioned
Those models are programmed to
frown at bad news

HOLOGRAM
Hah Then even in this day and

age catching the killer all comes
down to pure instinct

Spooner smiles But his eyes are troubled He gets up
Walks over to the window Stares out

EXT CITY OUTSKIRTS - DESERTED ROADS - DAWN

Sonny walking along deserted streets Looking over his
shoulder Keeping in the shadows

SPOONER (VO)
Victor thought that by letting your
robot exist Id be condemning the
human race as we know it to
extinction

HOLOGRAM (VO)
Bah Sounds like nonsense But
why are you so worried We will
both be dead long before then --

EXT WASTELAND - NIGHT

Sonny walks the barren hills of the surrounding countryside

HOLOGRAM (VO)
Oh what am I saying I am dead
already

EXT WASTELAND - DAWN

Sonny steps onto the grounds of the JUNKYARD The power
lines above him surging with energy He walks past the
burned-out husks of industrial machinery

Then we hear it The SOUND of MECHANICAL JOINTS Getting
louder and louder And just as before a BROKEN-DOWN ROBOT
emerges into the dawn light And ANOTHER And ANOTHER

But not quite like before The robots arent teetering
Arent lumbering They keep on coming Their bent and
broken bodies straightening out as

DOZENS of ROBOTS rise up Slowly Gathering around in a
large circle As they all turn to look at
SONNYS SILHOUETTE Slowly climbing to the top of the hill
Looking out at the vast junkyard below

CLOSE ON SONNY Standing proud and defiant The SUN
creeping over the horizon A new day filled with infinite

possibilities
The robots Staring up at him Eager for what comes next

FADE OUT
