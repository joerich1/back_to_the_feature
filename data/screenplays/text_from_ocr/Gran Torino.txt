Written by

Nick Schenk

FADE IN
INT CHURCH

Were at the funeral of Dorothy Kowalski In attendance
are mostly old folks their offspring and several bored
teenagers

WALT KOWALSKI stands towards the front of the church He
speaks to an older MAN in a bulky out-of-date suit

OLDER MAN
Im real sorry about Dorothy
Walt She was a real peach

WALT

Thanks for coming Al

Walt Kowalski looks young for his age He has slate blue
eyes physically fit and has had the same buzz cut
hairstyle since getting out of the military in 1953

Walt is also a perfectionist Nothing escapes his
hawklike eyes eyes that pierce and judge

Walt looks around at how the young people have dressed at
his wifes funeral His eyes narrow at his
GRANDDAUGHTERs belly button ring

WALT

Jesus Christ

Walts two sons MITCH and STEVE watch their father from
across the pews

MITCH

Look at the Old Man glaring at
Ashley He cant even tone it
down at Moms funeral

STEVE

What do you expect Dads still
living in the ‘50s He expects
his granddaughter to dress a
little more modestly
MITCH

Yeah well your kids wearing a
Timberwolves jersey Im sure Dad
appreciates that

STEVE

My point is that theres nothing
anyone can do that wont
disappoint the Old Man

(MORE)

PAGE 3

Its inevitable Thats why we
stopped doing Thanksgivings the
deal with the boat motor the
broken bird bath its always
something

MITCH

What are we going to do with him
Dont you think hell get in
trouble by himself over in the old
neighborhood

STEVE
Why dont you have him move in
with you

MITCH
Ha ha

INT CHURCH - LATER

The choir sings the Beatitudes

Walt looks around disgustedly at the people gathered as
one woman looks through her day planner an old guy dozes
and his Granddaughter Ashley applies nail polish

FATHER JANOVICH the very young parish priest steps up
to the altar and delivers the eulogy for Walts wife
Walt sits ramrod straight and listens to the thin weak
unconvincing words of Father Janovich

FATHER JANOVICH

Death is often a bittersweet

occasion to us Catholics Bitter

in the pain it causes the deceased
and their families Sweet to

those who know the salvation that
awaits them And some may ask
what is death Is it the end Or
is it the beginning And what is
life What is this thing we call
life

WALT

Jesus

Walt coughs He takes a handkerchief and wipes his lips
He looks down and notices a speck of BLOOD on the white
cloth

INT WALTS HOUSE - SAME TIME

The house is crammed with people following the service
Walt doesnt know what to do with himself He has to
keep busy Steve steps over to his father

STEVE
A lot of people showed up after
the service

WALT

Yeah well I spose they knew
thered be plenty of ham I think
Ill go downstairs and get some
more chairs

STEVE
Ill do it Dad

WALT
Naw we need them now not next
week

INT CELLAR - SAME TIME

Grandsons JOSH DANIEL and DAVID look through boxes in
the cellar A box of old Korea War photos are pawed
through

Josh holds up a black-and-white PHOTO -- a young WALT
looks utterly exhausted behind him six bodies are

sprawled dead on the ground

DAVID
Is that Dad

DANIEL
No its Grandpa Walt
Josh turns the photo over and reads it

JOSH
‘Third Platoon E company March
second 1952 Korea

DANIEL
Wheres Korea

JOSH
Hell if I know
David holds up a MEDAL

PAGE 5

DAVID

Cool I found a medal

They hear someone coming downstairs By the time Walt
descends the staircase the boys sit on the couch
pretending to be doing nothing

Walt gives them a hard look as he grabs some chairs

UPSTAIRS

People eat and chat Ashley marches over to her parents
KAREN and Mitch

ASHLEY (GRANDDAUGHTER)

How long do we have to stay this

ghetto is a dead zone for my cell

and Im bored

Walt stands behind them with an armful of folding chairs
he overheard his Granddaughter Mitch and Karen are
embarrassed

MITCH
Ashley honey Why dont you help
Grandpa Walt with the chairs

ASHLEY
Me

KAREN
Yes you
ASHLEY
Grandpa Walt can I help you with
the chairs

WALT

Ill take care of it you just

painted your nails

Walt opens the folding chairs and looks out the window
Its snowing Walt puts on his coat he almost looks
relieved to get out of the house

WALT

Id better salt the sidewalk

before someone falls and breaks a

hip

Walt taps the floor with his boot and DAISY his very
very very old DOG follows him outside

PAGE 6

EXT WALTS HOUSE - EVENING

Walt carefully shovels his sidewalk He deliberately
stops at the boundary of his property

The reason for this is that Walts neighbors are now
mostly Asians who moved into the house that once belonged
to Polish families

Next door to Walts house some sort of party is going on
Walt can see through the window that the living room is
jammed with at least forty people all Asians all Hmong
And this is a problem for Walt because Walt is a full-
blown unrepentant racist

Walt lights a cigarette and speaks to his dog Daisy

WALT

Jesus Christ how many swamp rats

can they cram into a living room

Walt spits in the snow and walks back to the garage
INT GARAGE - SAME TIME

Walt steps inside and catches Ashley sneaking a
cigarette She has pulled back the canvas tarp that
covers his pride and joy his beloved 1972 GRAN TORINO
The Gran Torino is in mint condition It has been babied
since the day it rolled off the line

Ashley tosses her cigarette when she sees Grandpa Walt

ASHLEY

Wow Grandpa whend you get the

vintage car

Walt looks at her for a second then steps on her still
burning cigarette before answering

WALT

ASHLEY
I never knew you had a cool old
car

WALT
Its only been in here since
before you were born

PAGE 7

ASHLEY

So what are you like going to do
with it like when you die

Walt lights up a smoke --

WALT
Jesus Joseph and Mary
Walt pulls the cover back over the Gran Torino

ASHLEY

Then what about that super cool
retro couch in the den Im going
to State next year and I dont
have like any furniture

Walt walks out without commenting
BACK IN WALTS HOUSE

The doorbell rings and Walt opens the door Standing
there is TAO a sixteen-year-old HMONG boy Walt scowls
TAO is slight he has long hair long lashes but is very
good-looking -- like an Asian Johnny Depp

WALT
Who the hell are you

TAO
(very quietly)
Im Tao I live next door

WALT

What Speak up boy get the
shit out of your mouth What do
you want

TAO
Do you have jumper cables My
uncles car is old and

WALT

No And have some goddamned

respect zipper head were

mourning over here

Walt slams the door in Taos face

Walt turns and is suddenly cornered by Father Janovich
Walt hates situations like this

PAGE 8

FATHER JANOVICH
How you holding up Walt

WALT
Mr Kowalski
FATHER JANOVICH
Huh

WALT
Its Mr Kowalski not Walt

FATHER JANOVICH

Right Mr Kowalski Your wife
and I became quite close these
last few months She asked that I
watch over you when she passed on
I told her I watch out for my
entire flock but she made me
promise Id keep an extra sharp
eye on you

WALT

I appreciate your kindness to my

wife and now that youve spoken

your piece why dont you move on

to the next sheep

Walt starts to step away but Father Janovich blocks him

FATHER JANOVICH

Dorothy mentioned specifically
that it was her wish for you to go
to confession She said she
couldnt remember the last time
you went

WALT
Is that so

FATHER JANOVICH
It is
Walt drains his lowball glass

WALT

Well I confess I never much liked
church and only went because of
the wife And I confess I have no
desire to confess to a boy who is
fresh out of the seminary

PAGE 9

EXT WALTS HOUSE - LATER

People are leaving Walts house A mass of shuffling
stiff-jointed old Pollacks

Right next door -- walking the opposite direction are
more Hmong going up the sidewalk They laugh and chatter
and carry big dishes of food and fruit They are a happy
bunch compared to the dour crowd exiting Walts home
The Hmong are going to a birth ceremony A three-day-old
baby is named and three souls are located for the
newborn

Cut TO

ANOTHER ANGLE

Walt leans over a car that contains two shivering old
ladies from the funeral He hooks up the jumper cables
to their dead battery

Mitch Karen Ashley and Josh pull up next to Walt ina
brand new Toyota Land Cruiser Mitch opens the window

MITCH

Id really like to help Dad but

we have to get the kids home

theyre getting restless

Walt just looks at the TOYOTA EMBLEM on the Land Cruiser
and then gives Mitch a disgusted glance

WALT
Fine Go

MITCH

Ill call in a few see how youre

doing

Walt nods and lights a cigarette as they drive off

WALT
Kill you to buy American

INT LAND CRUISER - SAME TIME

MITCH

Did you see him look at the truck
Its always Rice-Burner this or
Jap-Buggy that Even at Moms
funeral he cant let it go

PAGE 10

KAREN
At least he didnt say anything
this time

MITCH
He didnt have to

KAREN

Well what do you expect The man
worked at a Ford plant for twenty-
eight years

MITCH
And I suppose thats my goddamned
fault

BACK ON WALT

Walt gets his guests engine running

As they drive off Walt hears faint SINGING Walt looks
into his neighbors backyard and cant believe his eyes
The Hmong all sing and chant as three CHICKENS have their
heads sliced off right there in the yard

The chickens are held up and everyone chants louder

Its a sacrifice Walt spits in the snow and says to
Daisy

WALT
Barbarians Goddamned barbarians

INT HMONG HOUSE NEXT DOOR - SAME TIME

The house is a buzz of activity The older Hmong speak
their native language the younger generation speaks both
English and Hmong

(NOTE Hmong is subtitled when necessary)

Taos Grandmother (PHONG) complains to a MAN

PHONG

(SUBTITLED)

Theres no man in this house
thats why my daughter should
remarry Being a second wife is
better than having a woman be the
head of the household Its not

our way

PAGE 11
MAN
(SUBTITLED)

What about Tao
PHONG

(SUBTITLED)
What about him

MAN

(SUBTITLED)
Hes the man in the house

PHONG

(SUBTITLED)
Taos not a man

(GESTURES)

Look at him in the kitchen
washing dishes like a woman Even
his sister gives him orders and he
obeys

The CAMERA PANS TO the kitchen where TAO washes a pile of
dishes An older relative drops dishes in the sink
without acknowledging Taos presence Its clearly an
insult

In the LIVING ROOM the Hmong “Soul Calling” ceremony
starts its next phase An elder the family SHAMAN is
present and begins the ritual

As the entire Hmong family gathers to watch Tao slips

on his coat and goes out the back door

EXT TAOS HOUSE - SAME TIME

Tao wobbles as he pedals his bike through the snow

Tao passes Walts garage and is startled as Walt appears
from a shadow JUMPER CABLES in his hands They make eye
contact as Tao passes

Walt spits in the snow and looks down at Daisy

WALT

I thought these zips were supposed
to be such hard workers Christ

I had my own car when I was his
age

EXT CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT

Tao exits the store gets on his bike and rides off

PAGE 12

A few blocks away Tao rides past a snowbank when --
WHAM A HOCKEY STICK is thrown through the spokes of his

front wheel Tao flies over the handlebars into the
snow
A chorus of laughter is heard Three LATINOS stand
around the stunned prone Tao

HEAD LATINO

Whatta you gonna do gook You

gonna ‘Kung Fu us

Tao just lies there as Latino 2 picks up his bike

LATINO 2
Surprised it aint a girls bike
The Latinos laugh Tao remains on the ground

HEAD LATINO
You gonna get up or what
Tao doesnt move

HEAD LATINO

Tell you what Ill let you take
the first swing You drop me and
you can have your bike back

Tao smiles he cant help it

HEAD LATINO

What the fuck you smiling at

gook Something funny

He grabs Tao by the jacket and pulls him to his feet

HEAD LATINO

You better get the fuck outta

here bitch

He pushes Tao backwards Tao falls back into the snow
This time Tao crab-walks back away from the Latinos
The Latinos stroll away with Taos bike

EXT WALTS HOUSE - SUNNY SPRING MORNING

SUPERIMPOSE THREE MONTHS LATER
Walt is going about the chores of spring cleaning

PAGE 13

Walt looks around with disdain at his neighbors houses
Walts property is perfectly kept whereas his neighbors
houses are rundown

Walts eyes linger on every defect gutter hangs ripped
screen doors peeling paint One neighbor has installed
a chicken coop

Walt looks down at Daisy --

WALT

Damn chinks let their yards go to
hell Polarski would turn over in

his grave if he could see what

they did to his lawn

Tao walks past Walt watches him pass

WALT

I dont know why these goddamned
slopes had to move to my block
This used to be a nice
neighborhood

EXT TAOS HOUSE - SAME TIME

Tao nods to an older woman rocking in a broken rocking
chair PHONG nods back to Tao then turns her evil eye
back on Walt whom shes been seething at all morning

PHONG

(SUBTITLED)

Why doesnt that stupid hairy

white man move He must be too

dumb to realize hes not welcome

here All the Mee-Khah left in

the neighborhood should just move

away Look at him strut like a

rooster

She sees Walt glance at her and spit Phong glares back
and spits beetle juice which has turned her teeth black

INT WALTS HOUSE - DAY

Daisy snoozes next to the front door The doorbell
rings Daisy doesnt even move Walt walks to the front
door holding a roll of duct tape The doorbell rings
again

Walt looks down at Daisy --

PAGE 14

WALT

Jesus Christ dog have you gone

totally deaf

Walt opens the door Standing on his front step is
Father Janovich

FATHER JANOVICH

WALT

FATHER JANOVICH

WALT

The problem is I think youre an
overeducated 27-year-old virgin
who holds the hands of
superstitious old women and
promises them eternity

PAGE 15
Walt shuts the front door in Father Janovichs face

EXT STREET - DAY

Tao walks down the street his head in a book He
finally realizes theres a blue Chevy following slowly
behind him

The blue Chevy is now parallel with Tao and keeps pace
with his step Tao looks over to the occupants of the
Chevy

ts two LATINOS Tao quickens his pace but the Chevy
easily keeps up with Tao

LATINO DRIVER

Tao laughs but keeps walking

LATINO DRIVER

Down the street -- is a suped-up HONDA CIVIC with a big
SPOILER on the back Inside are five Hmong gangbangers

from Tao and the Latinos car

SMOKIE

LATINO DRIVER

Oh goody more Rice Niggers

The Latino Driver smiles and flashes a PISTOL

A Hmong kid in the back seat opens the door and displays
a sub-machine gun The Latinos are way out-gunned

LATINO 2

Fucking Viet Cong swamp rats Go

back to your fucking rice paddy

The Latinos screech their tires and are gone The Hmongs
in the car smile and congratulate themselves

Tao simply keeps walking down the street

SMOKIE

Where the fuck does he think hes

They swing a U-turn and pull up to Tao keeping pace with
him as he walks

SPIDER

Tao nods as he walks but doesnt answer

SPIDER

PAGE 17
Tao looks at the sub-machine gun cradled by the Hmong
gangbanger in the back seat

Smokie takes this all in He looks down the street and
sees that in a half block Tao will have to pass a group
of Latino gangbanger types

SMOKIE
You think about it and well see

‘Death is bittersweet Bitter in
the pain sweet in the salvation
Thats what you know of life and

bayonets we hacked seventeen-year-
old kids to death with shovels

beam of a flashlight in his garage

WALT

Son of a bitch

Walt pulls on his robe opens the closet and pulls out
the big 30-06 Ml Garand Rifle he took home from Korea
Walt slides a magazine into the top of the Ml and
chambers a round with a loud SNAP

INT GARAGE - SECONDS LATER

The light flips on and before he can blink Tao is face
to face with the barrel of Walts M1 RIFLE

Walt is silent he has one eye closed so he can better
aim at Taos forehead -- which is nine inches away Tao
drops the tool he was holding it bounces with a loud
metallic clang

Tao backs away his eyes wide with terror As Tao backs
up Walt advances step for step

Tao trips over a garden hose which causes Walt to trip
They both start to fall The lightbulb is bumped with
the rifle barrel and swings back and forth

As Walt hits the garage floor he accidentally FIRES THE
RIFLE The bullet goes through a big metal Hamms Beer
sign on the wall

Tao scrambles to his feet and jumps like a deer over
Walt Tao runs out of the garage and into the night

Walt lies on the floor for a second stunned Sweat runs
down his forehead He coughs up blood The lightbulb
still swings casting odd shadows in the garage

WALT
Shit

DISSOLVE TO

EXT WALTS DRIVEWAY - EVENING

Dusk is falling Walt finally gets up folds up his lawn
chair and walks stiffly back into the garage

Walt flips on the outdoor light highlighting the Gran
Torino still sitting at an angle in the driveway The

Mechanics

Walt goes in the back door and a moment later the kitchen
light comes on The Gran Torino remains in the driveway
Its a challenge an invitation Walt is daring the
thief to come back And Walts ready this time

EXT WALTS STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

A middle-aged Hmong Man from across the street comes into
the yard All the gangbangers overreact and pull their
pistols The middle-aged Hmong Man gets in Spiders face
and is cracked across the jaw with a pistol barrel

Tao back-pedals away from Spider and Smokie It becomes
a pushing rolling surging melee

Walts calm demeanor is unnerving to the gangbangers
The guns in their hands seem tiny compared to the big
military rifle Walt holds

SMOKIE
Are you fucking crazy Go back in
your house old man

WALT
Get off my lawn

SMOKIE
Im not fucking around Gramps
Walt spits out the side of his mouth He grins

WALT

Dont think for a second I wont

blow a big hole in your face and

it wont bother me a bit not any

more than if I shot a deer Now

get off my goddamned lawn

Two of the Hmong gangbangers take a step back Walt
senses their fear Only Smokie holds his ground

WALT

Believe me kid Ill blow your
damn head off go back to bed and
sleep like a baby I couldnt
care less

SMOKIE
Im not gonna warn you again
Walt laughs

WALT

Youre nothing to me In Korea
we stacked fucks like you five
feet high and used you as
sandbags

PAGE 30

Complete silence theres no sound anywhere in the
neighborhood All eyes are on Walt

Walt CLICKS OFF the safety on the Ml Garand Rifle
Smokie and the gangbangers give Walt fierce looks but
melt back towards their car

As they get into the car -- Smokie has to say something
SMOKIE

You better watch yourself old

man

The Honda screeches its tires and goes off down the
street

Walt looks at Tao Sue Mom and Grandma who stand in
stunned silence in his front yard

A PAUSE Finally Sue speaks up

SUE
Thank you
Walt lowers his rifle and spits on the ground

WALT
I said get off my lawn

INT WALTS HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

We hear a sound outside Walt grabs his rifle swings
open the front door and leads with the barrel

Cut TO

EXT WALTS FRONT PORCH - SAME TIME

Walt looks around and slowly lowers his rifle

His front porch is covered with FLOWERS and FRUIT and
GIFTS of food There must be a dozen different gifts
piled there
Daisy comes out and stretches on the porch before
putting her nose in a food basket

WALT
Bad dog Bad deaf dumb blind
dog

PAGE 31

EXT WALTS HOUSE - DAY

Walt carries three big bouquets of flowers to the trash
He dumps them on top of other gifts he received from the
Hmongs His garbage is overflowing

Coming down the alley is another Hmong couple they smile
carrying a basket filled with Asian vegetables

Walt holds up his hand like a traffic cop

WALT

No No more

The Hmong couple nod say something with a smile and turn
around

NEXT DOOR

Tao his mother and Sue argue in the yard They gesture
towards Walts house The women buzz around Tao all
speaking in his ear at the same time

Phong yells at them from the porch but they ignore her
Walt watches as the mother and Sue march Tao towards his
house Tao looks like a whipped dog

WALT

Why wont these people leave me

alone

Walt walks out to meet them at his property line and puts
up his hands indicating theyve come far enough

Sue holds up a plant

SUE
We brought you some shallots to
plant in your garden

WALT
I dont want them

SUE
Theyre perennials they come back
every year

WALT

No You keep them Why do you
people keep giving me all this
garbage

Sue is a little taken aback

PAGE 32

SUE
Because because you saved Tao

WALT
No I didnt All I did was get a
bunch of jabbering gooks off my

lawn

SUE

Well youre a hero to the
neighborhood

WALT

No Im not

SUE

Too bad they think you are and
thats why theyre bringing you
the gifts

WALT

Just take your plant and leave me

alone

Walt turns and starts to walk away

Taos mother speaks rapidly in Hmong to Sue They look
at Tao and then to Walt

SUE
Theres another thing

WALT

SUE

This is my mother Vu Im Sue and
this is my brother Tao We live

WALT
So

SUE

Sue shoots a hard look at Tao who shifts uncomfortably

TAO

WALT

PAGE 33

TAO

For trying to steal your car

Walts eyes go wide in recognition He turns white with

rage

WALT

Get this straight I see you on my

property again youre done

Walt turns on his heels and storms into his house

INT WALTS ENTRYWAY

The doorbell rings Walt opens it to find Father

Janovich standing on his front step

FATHER JANOVICH
Good afternoon Walt
Walts eyes narrow

FATHER JANOVICH
I mean Mr Kowalski

WALT
I already told you Im not going
to confession

FATHER JANOVICH
Why didnt you just call the
police

WALT
Pardon

FATHER JANOVICH

I do work with some of the Hmong
gangs and I heard there was some
trouble in the neighborhood Why
didnt you call the police

WALT
Oh I prayed for them to show up
but guess what No answer

FATHER JANOVICH

What were you thinking Someone
could have been killed Were
talking life and death here

PAGE 34

WALT

Not that its any of your
goddamned business but when
things happen quickly like that
you have to react In Korea we
never ‘called the police when a

swarm of screaming gooks came
pouring into our lines We
reacted

FATHER JANOVICH
Were not in Korea Mr Kowalski
Walt says nothing

FATHER JANOVICH

Ive been thinking about our
discussion on life and death
About what you said About how
you carry around the horrible
things you were forced to do
Horrible things that wont leave
you It seems that it would do
you good to unload some of that
burden Things done during war
are terrible being ordered to
ill killing to save others
illing to save yourself Youre
right those are things I dont
now anything about But I do
now about forgiveness And Ive
seen a lot of men who have
confessed their sins admitted
their guilt and left their burdens
behind them Stronger men than
you Men at war who were ordered
to do appalling things and are now
at peace

Walt nods Father Janovich threw a bulls-eye

WALT
Im impressed You came with your
guns loaded for once

FATHER JANOVICH
Thank you

WALT

You have balls Father And what
you said youre right Im sure
stronger men than me have found
their salvation Hallelujah But
theres one thing youre way wrong
about

Almost

PAGE 35

FATHER JANOVICH
Whats that Mr Kowalski

WALT
The thing that haunts a guy is the
stuff he wasnt ordered to do

INT OLD SCHOOL BARBERSHOP

The old balding BARBER finishes cutting Walts hair

BARBER

PAGE 36

EXT BARBERSHOP - SAME TIME

Walt gets in his old Ford pickup and drives off This is
a very bad rundown neighborhood

EXT SIDEWALK - SAME TIME

Sue walks with her ridiculous Wigger (urban white kid)
boyfriend TREY Trey wears big baggy pants a sports
jersey and an Oakland Raiders visor upside-down and
backwards

They walk past three BLACK GUYS leaning against a
building The TALL BLACK GUY spots Sue and smiles

TALL BLACK GUY

Hey girl you come over here and

talk to me Come on baby dont

be shy

Trey and Sue move as far over on the sidewalk as they can
to avoid the black guys They try to ignore them

TALL BLACK GUY

Come on sweetie dont be like
that You talk to me dont be
all stuck up and shit
ACROSS THE STREET

Walt waits at a stoplight He watches Sue and Trey and
the three black guys who block their path

One black guy flips Treys VISOR onto the ground The
Tall Guy makes “kissy faces” at Sue as he touches his
crotch

Walt sits there for a second he shouldnt help but Walt
solves every situation by being aggressive

Walt drives off then makes a U-turn

The Tall Black Guy now focuses on Trey

TALL BLACK GUY

What are you ‘sposed to be

Trey puts up his hand to “hi-five” The Tall Black Guy
just looks at him

TREY
Yo its cool dog

The Tall Black Guy grabs Sue by the arm Trey moves
slightly towards Sue and is pushed down into a pile of
garbage

TALL BLACK GUY
You think youre pretty funny

SUE

picture

The Tall Black Guy pushes Sue hard against the wall
TALL BLACK GUY

The old black pickup pulls up and stops next to them
Sue Trey and the black guys look over

Walt sits behind the wheel he looks right through the
Tall Black Guy

TALL BLACK GUY

WALT

You have to be pretty goddamned

someone who will push back

The black guys are a bit dumbfounded Walt stares them
down

WALT

But you might just be dumb enough

not to recognize that your luck

just ran out

All bravado drains away from the black guys Walt is a
rock

Walt grins slightly and spits on the ground

TALL BLACK GUY

Fuck this guy He aint worth it

The trio walks slowly across the street forcing a car to
miss a green light

Trey puts his hand out to shake Walts

TREY

Man thanks a lot mister

Walt doesnt extend a hand he lets Trey stand there like
an idiot Trey slowly lowers his arm

Walt looks at Treys outfit

WALT

Go home clown and pull up your
goddamned pants

Walt turns to Sue

WALT

EXT WALTS FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING

Walt drinks coffee and reads the newspaper He flips
from section to section Daisys at his feet

Next door Phong sits watching Walt He can see her
mumbling under her breath

WALT
Old hag giving me the evil eye
Walt opens the paper to the TV guide section and lingers
at the HOROSCOPES for a second

WALT
Aw what the hell
Walt reads aloud to himself

WALT

Your birthday today This year you
have to make a choice between two
life paths Second chances come
your way Extraordinary events
culminate in what might seem to be
an anti-climax Your lucky

numbers are 84 23 11 78 and

Walt drains his coffee and tosses the paper onto the
porch

WALT

What a load of crap

Walt lights up a cigarette and exhales

Walt watches as the only white woman on the block
struggles to unload her groceries from her car One of
her bags rips

PAGE 43

Three teenagers walk past and laugh at her spilled
groceries One of them makes a crude gesture behind her
back

WALT

Christ all Friday Whats wrong

Walt gets up to go help but before he can get to the
sidewalk another neighbor has gone over to help
Its TAO Tao bends down and carries her bags up to her
door

WALT

Mitch screeches the tires as they take off Walt waits
for them to clear out before coming out on the porch
with a can of Pabst

Daisy comes out and lies at his feet

Walt covers his mouth as he coughs A dime-sized circle
of dark red blood is left in the palm of his hand
Walt looks at the blood as he takes another sip of beer
EXT WALTS PORCH - EVENING

Walt continues to sit on his porch a long row of empty
Pabst beer cans are lined up on the railing

PHONG

(SUBTITLED)

A man like him brings nothing

Several relatives usher Phong away from Walt The
relatives are embarrassed at the outburst

WALT
She hates me

SUE
Yes she hates you

WALT

What did I do

A little Hmong girl walks past and Walt pats her on the
head Everyone in the room looks in horror at Walt

WALT

What What the hell are all you

fish heads looking at

Sue looks around and then pulls Walt out of the room

SUE
Maybe we should go in the other
room

INT DINING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Sue explains a few facts to Walt

PAGE 49

SUE

A lot of the people in this house
are very traditional Number one
never touch a Hmong person on the
head not even a child Hmong
people believe that the soul
resides in the head so dont do
that

WALT
Thats dumb but fine

SUE

Hmong people also consider looking
someone in the eye to be rude
Thats why everyone looks away
when you look at them

WALT
Swell Anything else

SUE

Yeah some Hmong smile or grin
when theyre yelled at or get into
a confrontation Its a cultural
thing It expresses embarrassment
or insecurity not that theyre
laughing at you

WALT
Good God you people are all nuts

INT LIVING ROOM

Walt opens another beer as Sue speaks Hmong to a
relative Walt notices an Old Hmong Man staring at him
Walt interrupts Sue

WALT
Hey Sue
SUE
What

WALT

You said you guys dont look you

in the eye but that guy keeps
staring at me

Sue laughs and gestures to the Old Hmong Man The Old
Hmong Man steps over and nods to Walt

PAGE 50

SUE
This is Kor Khue Hes the Lor
family shaman

WALT
Witch doctor
Sue smiles and nods

SUE

Something like that The Hmong
hold their clan Shaman in very
high regards

WALT

Boo-ga boo-ga

or Khue says something to Sue
translates to Walt

SUE

or Khue is interested in you
heard what you did He says he
would like to read you

WALT
Huh

SUE

He wants to read you Tell you
your soul Itd be rude not to
allow him this its a great

in Hmong

he

She turns and
honor

WALT

Tell Kor to be my guest fire

away

Sue speaks Hmong to the Shaman The Shaman responds and
sits down across from Walt He looks at Walt for a long
time

Walt stares straight back at him The Shaman mumbles to
himself

Finally the Shaman turns to Sue and speaks very rapidly
As Sue translates the Shaman watches Walts reaction

SUE

Kor Khue says that you think
youve been disrespected You do
not live your life Your food has
no flavor You are scared of your
past

(MORE)

PAGE 51

You stopped living years and years

ago Kor Khue says youre not at

peace

Walt looks like hes been hit by a truck The Shaman
watches Walt closely he knows he hit the nail on the
head

Walt looks pale Hes been spooked good He wipes sweat
from his forehead

WALT

Excuse me

Walt gets up and steps into the kitchen He takes
several deep breaths Hes pretty shook up

WALT

Je -- zuz -- Christ

Walt looks around at all the Hmongs eating and carrying
on

Walt sees a young man give up his seat to an Elder
Walt sees a young woman go to each of the older folks
offer tea and cookies from a tray

Walt sees a child help an old man out of the bathroom
Walt coughs hard He wipes blood from his lips Sue
comes in and looks at Walt

SUE
Are you okay
Walt brushes past her and goes into the bathroom

INT BATHROOM - SAME TIME

EPIPHANY

Walt washes his face in the sink and dries his hands
Hes still pale He looks long and hard in the mirror
Walt is stunned it all adds up Walt hasnt really
lived in 50 years he hasnt relaxed or exhaled or let
his guard down since he got back from Korea in 1953

WALT

(to himself)

Son of a bitch Ive got more in
common with these goddamned gooks
than my own spoiled-rotten family

SUE (CONTD)

PAGE 52
Walt looks at himself

WALT

Happy birthday

Walt opens the bathroom door Sue stands there with a
concerned look on her face

SUE
Are you okay

and
WALT
Me Im fine

SUE
You were bleeding
Walt smiles disarmingly

WALT

I just bit my tongue Im fine
Im great Lets get some of that
gook food Im starving

INT KITCHEN

Walt sits amongst several old Hmong Women who take great
delight in feeding him different Hmong dishes which hes
obviously never tasted before

Walt reacts with great enthusiasm to the food
occasionally making jokes like hes choking etc This
corny stuff goes over like gangbusters with the Hmong
ladies

Sue comes in and rolls her eyes at Walt

SUE
Come on you glutton lets go
downstairs

WALT
Why

SUE
To mingle

WALT

mingling

SUE

Come on you said ‘not to leave

PAGE 53

INT BASEMENT - SAME TIME

Walt and Sue descend the stairway Walt is really out of
his element down with all the Hmong teenagers

And the first person he sees across the room is Tao

WALT
Oh great

SUE
Well look whos over there

WALT
Whats-his-name who tried to steal
my Gran Torino

SUE
My brother Tao

WALT

Yeah Toad

Tao is in the corner he avoids Walts gaze Sue walks
over to a group of boys leaving Walt alone

Walt doesnt know what to do with himself He leans
against the DRYER The DRYER wobbles

Walt gets on his hands and knees He looks under the
dryer He adjusts the short leg to balance out the
machine

He just cant help it

All the Hmong kids watch Walt trying not to laugh at
this strange white man on his hands and knees fixing a
dryer during a party Walt looks up -- deer in the
headlights

WALT

It was wobbly but I fixed it

Its fine now shouldnt wobble

anymore

The Hmong kids look away covering their mouths with
their hands

Walt glares at Tao who immediately wipes the smile from
his face Sue walks over and hands Walt a drink

WALT
Whats this

PAGE 54

SUE
Rice liquor Try it

WALT

Alright

Sue walks off Walt sips his rice liquor and watches the
interaction between the boys and girls

One particularly gorgeous young willow-wisp of a GIRL
stares across the room at Tao Tao looks back at her
but then looks away

The Girl keeps looking at Tao smiling and twisting her
hair

Tao doesnt approach her but three other young men do
They do their best to charm her Shes polite but not
interested she keeps looking at Tao

Walt laughs at Taos ineptitude shakes his head at this
wasted opportunity Suddenly the Girl steps over to
Walt

She smiles --

WALT

Tao looks like he wants to run away

WALT

Hmong to Walt He has no idea what they are saying

WALT

EXT WALTS FRONT YARD - DAY

While Walt fills a bird feeder he notices Tao next door
Tao stands tiptoed on the top of a six-foot ladder
trying to cut a high branch with a pole saw

Walt shakes his head and walks over to Tao

WALT
Hey moron
Tao is startled and almost falls off the ladder

TAO
What

WALT

I appreciate youre doing
something on your own but youre
the only person I know dumb enough
to get himself killed trimming
tree branches

TAO
What now

WALT

You dont stand on the top step of

a ladder and if you cut through

that branch youre hacking away

at youll end up kaput

Tao looks and sure enough -- a thick black POWER LINE is
five feet below the branch hes almost severed

Go grab the extension ladder from
my garage and Ill show you how to
do it right zipper head

cigarette looks up in the tree and nods

WALT

Make sure you put the ladder back
when youre done raking up the
leaves

TAO

Walt walks back over to his porch grabs a Pabst from the
cooler and watches Tao rake

A white Honda turns the corner and drives slowly past
Tao

Smokie and Spider smile menacingly at Tao as they pass

WALT

This kid doesnt have a chance

The Honda now slowly passes Walts house Walt just
stands there sipping his beer

The Honda slows to a stop and the gangbangers glare at
Walt

The REAR WINDOW of the Honda opens

Walt holds out his RIGHT HAND like a GUN He closes one
eye to better “aim” his imaginary gun and moves his thumb
several times as if firing Bang -- bang -- bang

The Honda takes off Walt watches it drive off and
lights another cigarette

Walt doesnt notice but Tao witnessed this whole
interaction from his yard

INT WALTS ENTRYWAY - MORNING

The doorbell rings

Walt opens his door Tao stands there with his hands in
his pockets Hes a bit apprehensive

Tao flips the switch on the CEILING FAN the fan wobbles
and shakes it looks like its about to fly off

workbench Walt reinstalls the diverter valve Tao
looks at all of Walts tools

attract a decent set of tools

TAO

WALT

Look kid I think I know where

Walt rattles around his tool bench and slaps down THREE
items in quick succession
WALT

vise-grips Any man whos worth a
shit can do half his household
jobs with these three things In

screws that hold the fan blade to the motor hub

EXT WALTS PORCH - DAY

Walt and Sue sit eating Laab as they watch Tao who
washes and waxes the Gran Torino in Walts driveway
Sue laughs and shakes her head

SUE
Kind of ironic huh

WALT

SUE

What the hell do you think Im
referring to Toad washing the
car he tried to steal from you

WALT

It seems like justice to me And
if he misses a spot hes doing it
all over

SUE

Its nice of you to kind of look
after him like this He doesnt

have any real role models in his
life

WALT
I aint a role model

WALT
Hand me a beer Dragon Lady
Sue hands him a beer and Walt pops the top

WALT

So tell me the problem with Hmong
boys again Im not completely
clear

SUE

Hmong girls slip in and out of the
culture more easily Date who we
want stay close to our mothers
but are able to keep a foot on
each side of the fence The boys
fall through the cracks

WALT
Why

SUE
Its tough The boys float
around The fathers belong ina
totally different world and the
boys have no one to turn to Does
that make sense

WALT
Not sure No

SUE

The boys dont ask their fathers
for advice because over here
their fathers no longer have the
answers

(MORE)

PAGE 79

Hmong boys become almost
invisible they end up banding
together and it all goes to hell
from there

WALT
The girls go to college and the
boys go to jail

SUE

Its more common than not

Walt reflects on this for awhile then changes the
subject

clown

SUE

wit

Walt nods
