OPENING SEQUENCE

Blue Moon against a black sky
Blue house silhouette against a black sky
The house recede into the background getting smaller and smaller

EXT LARGE HOME NIGHT

Upper middle-class home with Christmas decorations Very noisy Sounds of
many people talking at once Wheres my suitcase

INT LARGE HOME NIGHT

A policeman with his back to the camera stands in the hallway He tries
to get someone two pay attention to him but everyone ignores him Two
small girls walk down the staircase A third girl walks up a fourth girl
walks down They all walk past the policeman as if he didnt exist He
stands alone with his hands on his hips expressing exasperation

Rejection of authority generates humor This allows the audience to
vicariously experience superiority over policemen and releases repressed
feelings of resentment that expresses itself in laughter The policeman is
a traffic cop that is being ignored a deviation from normal patterns of
behavior The policeman becomes frustrated The audience finds the
exasperation of an authority figure to be amusing

INT PARENTS BEDROOM NIGHT

Kevins mother is on the phone talking to a friend She packs clothes on
the bed while her husband is in the bathroom A small boy KEVIN walks
into the room

Mom Uncle Frank wont let me watch the movie But the big kids can Why
cant I

Kevin Im on the phone responds his mother
Its not even rated R Hes just being a jerk
Kevin if Uncle frank says no then it must be really bad

Common empathy structure of a young child being ignored by his parents or
guardians Elliott in ET and Dorothy in WIZARD OF OZ

Kevin jumps on the bed His mother tells him to get off but he ignores
her Kevin picks up a book that is a travel guide to France Hang up the
phone and make me why dont you

Resentment at being ignored

Kevins father wearing a blue shirt walks into the room he talks to his
wife

Hey by any chance did you pick up a voltage adapter thing

No I didnt have a chance

How am I supposed to shave in France

Grow a goatee

Dad nobody will let me do anything says Kevin
You want to do something you can pick up those micro-machines in the
hall Aunt Leslie stepped on one and almost broke her neck

He was in the garage again playing with the glue gun says the mother
Kevin makes a grim face and signals to his mother to stop talking by
cutting his throat with hand

Didnt we talk about that says his father

Kevin replies with an attitude Did I burn down the joint I dont think
so I was making ornaments out of fish-hooks

My new fish-hooks replies the father

I cant make ornaments out of the old ones with dry worm guts stuck on
them

Humor generated from the clash of two opposing points of view each
understandable or expressing a truth from their perspective Kevins
behavior is appropriate from his perspective but inappropriate from the
fathers perspective

Kevins dad picks him up and starts to carry him out of the room

Aunt Leslie enters and says Peter Kay do you guys have a voltage
adapter

Effective way of naming father and mother with a repetition of the
voltage adapter request Incompetence factor No one has thought of getting
the tool that they will need to use their appliances in France
Incompetence generates laughter

Heres a voltage adapter says Peter as he places Kevin in Aunt Leslies
arms
Oh youre getting heavy Go pack your suitcase
Pack my suitcase

Terror strikes Kevin He is incompetent helpless vulnerable He cant
take care of himself This generates empathy for him especially when his
sisters and brothers refuse to help him and instead ridicule him

INT DINING ROOM NIGHT

A girl walks by a young boy sitting at the dining room table

Do you know where the shampoo is Fuller

I dont live here replies Fuller

I dont believe that in a house with this many people there is no
shampoo

The policeman stops her
Pardon me are youre parents home
Yeah but they dont live here she says as she walks away

Humor generated by a literal response to a question which states a truth
but doesnt give the answer that the questioner desired This is a
deviation from expected patterns of communication The norm is that if a
person asks a question you should attempt to satisfy his information
request not make a true statement that is irrelevant to his needs An
instance of miscommunication

A girl wearing a Northwestern tee shirt comes down the staircase She
speaks with another girl Tracy did you order pizza
Roz did

Excuse me Miss Are your parents here asks the cop
My parents are in Paris Sorry

The policeman grabs a little girl by the shoulder Hi are your parents
home

Yeah

Do they live here

No

No Why should they All kids no parents Probably a fancy orphanage

Humorous because this is a unexpected yet plausible interpretation of
the situation

INT BEDROOM NIGHT

Kevin sits with one of his brothers who is packing a suitcase I dont
know how to pack a suitcase I have never done this once in my whole life
says Kevin

Tough

They walk out into the hallway

Thats what Marie said

What did I say

You told Kevin tough

The dope was whining about his suitcase What am I supposed to do Shake
his hand and say congratulations youre an idiot

Tm not an idiot says Kevin

Empathy is generated for Kevin because he is being ridiculed

Oh really Youre completely helpless Everyone has to do everything for
you

Shes right Kev

Excuse me puke breath Im a lot smaller than you I dont know how to
pack a suitcase

Another girl walks down the hallway Hey I hope you didnt just pack
crap Jeff

Shut up Linnie

You know what I should pack Kevin asks Jeff
I already told you cheese face Toilet paper and water

Listen Kevin what are you so worried about You know that Mom is going
to pack your stuff anyway You are what the French call Les Incompetent
says Linnie

What says Kevin

Characterization of Kevin as incompetent completely helpless

Jeff throws a packed bag down the staircase BOMBS AWAY The bag lands at
the feet of the policeman

The audience laughs because of the near-miss of a disaster The built up
tension is released through laughter This is an instance of a relief
theory of laughter

Linnie continues talking to Kevin PS You have to sleep on the
hide-a-bed with Fuller If he has something to drink hes going to wet the
bed

This is the most babyish of all actions and Kevin will have to sleep in
the wet bed Disgusting situations also generate laughter

Kevin stands alone on the balcony This house is so full of people it
makes me sick When I grow up and get married Im living alone DID YOU
HEAR ME IM LIVING ALONE Kevin shouts as he jumps up and down

Humor generated be the contradiction of being married and living
alone plus the exaggerated reactions of Kevin jumping up and down ina
tantrum J

The policeman in amazement and with mouth agape watches Kevin as he jumps
up and down

This characters reaction is how the director wants the audience to
respond J

INT BUZZS BEDROOM NIGHT

A young boy wearing glasses taps on a glass aquarium that contains a large
tarantula Whose going to feed your spider while youre gone

He just eat a load of mice-kettes says Buzz He should be good for a
couple of weeks Is it true that French babes dont shave their pits

Gross coarse characterization of Buzz Deviant character type
Some dont

A picture of a nude playgirl hangs on the wall near a rifle and a poster
of a baseball player

Standard images associated with an adolescent male

But they got nude beaches says Buzz
Not in winter

Kevin enters the room and timidly approaches Buzz Buzz
Dont you know how to knock phflemwad
Buzz is ferociously antagonistic

None of the other children either help or seem to like Kevin which
generates empathy for him because hes just a small child who needs help
to pack his suitcase

Can I sleep in your room I dont want to sleep in the hide-a-bed with
Fuller if he has something to drink hell wet the bed

IT wouldnt let you sleep in my room if you were growing on my ass
replies Buzz

Suddenly they hear rustling outside their window
Check it out old man Marey says Buzz
The three boys run to the window

Who is he asks the boy with glasses
Outside they see an old man drag a metal garbage can down a snow covered
walk He carries a metal shovel in his free hand

You ever hear of the South Bend Shovel Slayer asks Buzz

No responds the boy with glasses

Thats him says Buzz Back in58 he murdered his whole family and half
the people on the block with the snow shovel Been hiding out in this
neighborhood ever since

Well if hes the Shovel slayer how come the cops dont arrest him

Not enough evidence to convict They never found the bodies but everyone
around here knows he did it And it will just be a matter of time before he
does it again

The old man shovels snow off the path then uses the shovel to spread salt
on the walk Kevin is frightened

Whats he doing now asks the boy with glasses

He walks up and down the street every night salting the sidewalks
Maybe hes trying to be nice

No way See that garbage can filled with salt thats where he keeps his
victims The salt turns the bodies into mummys

Kevin becomes terrorized Mummies he says

The old man looks up from his work and sees the three boys watching him
They quickly pull the drapes across the window The old man continues to
stare up at the window

Buzz creates a story about that old man that causes him to become the
source of terror and an antagonist in the mind of Kevin This fear Kevin
must overcome before he confronts the real villains of the story This also
setups the audience because it misdirects their beliefs and expectations
They like Kevin believe that the old man is the real villain of the
story

EXT STREET NIGHT

A pizza delivery car is recklessly driven down the street It pulls into
the front of Kevins house then hits the metal lawn boy stature knocking
it to the ground A the side of the car is painted LI TTLE NERO DELIVERS
20 MINUTES OR YOU DONT PAY The pizza delivery boy runs out of the car
and picks up the metal lawn boy statue

INT KEVINS HOME NIGHT

Two little children stare up at the policeman who is trying to find out if
they are going on a trip but the little boy and little girl just stare up
at him without responding There is a knock on the front door The
policeman opens the door and lets in the pizza delivery boy

Okay thats 12250 he says to the cop
Not for me kid I dont live here
Oh youre just around for the holidays
I guess you could say that

Uncle Frank sees the pizza and takes the boxes from the delivery boy
Thats 12250

Ah its my brothers house Hell take care of it

Frank walks away with the boxes of pizza

Franks character is established as being cheap This will be confirmed
throughout the story but is established as soon as he is introduced

Kevins father Peter comes downstairs and shakes hands with the
policeman

Hi says Peter

Hi answers the policeman Mr McCalister

Owes 12250 says the delivery boy

Am I under arrest or something asks Peter

No no no Christmas time Always a lot of burglars around the holidays
Just checking around the neighborhood to see that everyones taking proper
precautions thats all

Oh well we have automatic timers for our lights Locks for our doors
That about all that anyone can do nowadays You get eggnog or something
Eggnog Listen will you be leaving

Kevin runs downstairs yelling Pizza pizza
INT KITCHEN NIGHT
As Kevin enters everyone is already eating

Frank you got some money Come on says his wife
Travelers checks answers Frank

Probably the kind you cant use in Paris says Peter
Forget it Frank We have cash says Kay

Did anyone order me a plain cheese asks Kevin
Buzz stuffs his mouth with pizza
Oh yeah we did But if you want any someone will have to barf it all up
because its gone
Fuller go easy on the Pepsi says Aunt Leslie
Fuller stares at Kevin and smiles Kevin becomes infuriated

The audience realizes that Fuller will wet the bed now and Kevin will
have to sleep in it

Buzz mocks Kevin by telling him to get a plate then fakes throwing up the
pizza Kevin charges into Buzzs stomach and accidentally knocks over cups
of milk which wet the plane tickets

Passports yells Peter as he puts down the plastic Pepsi bottle The
bottle tips over and spills soda onto the table Uncle Frank pushes his
chair back and smashes Fuller against the wall Peter tries to sop up the
milk with napkins He unwittingly throws one of the plane tickets into the
garbage pail

This is necessary so that later when they board the plane that airline
attendant wont ask the parents why they have one extra ticket before the
plane departs
Kay yells at Kevin What is the matter with you

He started it He ate my pizza on purpose He knows that I hate sausage
and olives and says Kevin

Uncle Frank wipes the wet Pepsi from his pants Look what you did you
little jerk

Everyone stares down at Kevin

Kevin get upstairs right now says his mother

Kevin youre such a disease says Jeff
Kevin upstairs says his father

This creates empathy for Kevin because he is unfairly treated

Say goodnight Kevin says Kay
Goodnight Kevin responds Kevin

Kay drags Kevin into the hallway

Why do I always get treated like scum

The pizza boy is still standing by the front door while the policeman
looks around the living room Kay pays the pizza boy

Having a reunion or something asks the policeman

No my husbands brother transferred to Paris last summer and both his
kids are going to school here I guess he misses the family

The policeman smiles at Kevin His gold tooth sparkles Kevin notices this
Hes given us this trip to Paris so that we can all be together

Youre taking a trip to Paris

Yes we hope to leave tomorrow morning

Excellent Excellent answers the policeman

Excuse me this ones out of sorts says Kay as she pulls Kevin upstairs
Dont worry about me I spoke with your husband already and dont worry
about your home Its in good hands

Kay leads Kevin upstairs There are fifteen people in this house Youre
the only one who has to make trouble

Im the only one getting dumped on replies Kevin

Youre the only one acting up Now get upstairs

IT am upstairs dummy

Kay opens the door to the attic

The third floor asks Kevin in horror

Gol

Its scary up there

Dont be silly Fuller will be up there in a little while

I dont want to sleep with Fuller You know about him He wets the bed
Hell pee all over me I know

Fine well put him somewhere else answers the mother

Im sorry says Kevin

Its too late Get upstairs

Everyone in this family hates me

Then maybe you should ask Santa for a new family

IT dont want a new family I dont want any family Families suck
Just stay up there I dont want t see you again for the rest of the
night

I dont want t see you again for the rest of my whole life And I dont
want to see anyone else either
IT hope that you dont mean that Youd feel pretty sad if you woke up
tomorrow morning and you didnt have a family

No I wouldnt answers Kevin

Then say it again Maybe it will happen

I hope that I never see any of you jerks again

Kevin walks up into the attic as his mother closes the door

Kevin lies in the attic bed His thoughts are heard I wish they would all
just disappear

This is Kevins dream his primary objective
EXT SKY NIGHT

A full moon Clouds cover the moon Wind blows through the trees in front
of Kevins house The wind blows a plastic Santa Claus down the sidewalk
It blows a red ribbon off a lamppost It moves shutters on the window and
swings a light in front of the door It shakes a Santa Claus wreath on the
door A tree branch breaks and falls on some power lines causing an
electrical blackout The lights go out in Kevins house The LED on a clock
radio states 437 before it goes out due to power failure

This is the inciting event that causes the world of the protagonist to
change

EXT KEVINS HOUSE DAY

A man is knocking on the front door Two airport express vans are parked in
front of the house One driver knocks on the front door as the second
driver picks up the metal lawn boy statue Across the street a power

Peter she shouts as they both jump out of bed

airport

Funny because of the speeded up perception of time
EXT KEVINS HOUSE DAY

A boy walks towards the van from across the street

Hi Im Mitch Murphy I live across the street he says as he talks to a
man packing luggage into one of the vans

You guys going out of town Were going to Orlando Florida Well
actually first were going to Missouri to pick up my grandma Do you know
that the McCalisters are going to France Do you know if its cold there
Do you know if these vans get good mileage

Gee kid I dont know Hit the road answers the driver
Humor generated by the deviation from normal patterns of behavior the
young boy who continuously asks questions without waiting for an answer
and who irritates an authority figure

INT KEVINS HOUSE DAY

Fast speed footage of the household in pandemonium

Deviation from normal patterns of movement is humorous

Heather do a head count make sure that everyone is in the vans orders
Kay Where are the passports and tickets

I put them in the microwave to dry them off answers Peter

Humorous because this is non-standard behavior which has plausibility
truth from a different perspective

EXT KEVINS HOUSE DAY

Mitch is sitting in a van next to a driver How fast does this thing go
Does it have automatic transmission Does it have four wheel drive

Look says the driver I told you before kid dont bother me Now beat
it

Children exit from the house and line up in front of the vans Mitch is
inside one of the vans He opens up one of the traveling cases takes out a
camera and takes a photo of the inside of the van

Wow says Mitch

Deviant and stupid behavior is funny

Heather takes a head count and includes Mitch whose back is to her Mitch
is about the same size as Kevin Buzz is being difficult and distracting
her He calls out random numbers as she is trying to count

Half in this van half in this van orders Heather
Mitch exits the van Have a good trip Bring me back something French he
says as he walks away

Aunt Leslie Kay Uncle Frank and Peter exit the house peter locks the
door

As Kay enters the van the power man approaches her Mame I just want you
to know that your power is fixed but your phone lines are a mess its
going to take Ma bell a couple of days to patch it up especially around
the holidays
Heather did you count heads

Eleven including me Five boys six girls four parents two drivers and
a partridge and a pear tree

They drive away from the house

The frantic activity justifies forgetting Kevin

The children run on board

eaves a message saying that he is still in Paris at his brothers house
