EXT KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL DAY
CARL HERRICK early 50s gets out of his piece of junk
rusted through the floorboards ten-year-old Chevy station
wagon He approaches the school entrance The dull
weathered letters on the building spell out John F Kennedy
High School A marquee on the grass in front of the building
says Home of the Hawkeyes and Good Luck Class of 94

There are a few cars in the parking lot fewer people hanging
around -- school is out The rope on the flagpole clangs
against the pole A lonely desolate sound

Herrick battered briefcase in one hand empty box in the
other trudges into the building

INT KENNEDY HIGH

Herrick walks down the hallway At the far end of the
corridor a janitor is sweeping All of the lockers hang
open and empty Herrick enters a classroom

INT MUSIC ROOM

Herrick stands in the doorway and takes in the classroom

The piano at one end -- circling high on the wall are pictures
of Stephen Foster George Gershwin Art Tatum Dizzy
Gillespie Hank Williams Chuck Berry Brian Wilson and the
Beach Boys one each of the four Beatles Stevie Wonder

Elton John The Ramones Chrissie Hynde Dylan Springsteen
and of course Bob Seger -- this is Michigan after all

Cluttering the classroom is the detritus of the years -- a
dusty stuffed Opus figure a 45 record player records
sheet music a clear plastic paperweight with a dandelion
suspended inside -- a stained glass clef note hanging in the
window -- a bust of Beethoven painted psychedelic

Herrick breaks himself out of his reverie and walks over to
the desk and drops the box and his briefcase Where to begin

He pulls open the desk drawers and starts sorting through
them Some things go into the wastebasket others into the
briefcase or the box There is no joy in his work

So absorbed is he in his grim sorting that he doesnt hear
the entrance of GLEN MEISTER the boys gym teacher Near
60 his head as bald as a babys butt a stomach like he was
smuggling a watermelon under his sweatshirt

MEISTER
Hi Carl I I heard they
cut the music program Damn
shame Damn shame Wont be
too long before the pennypinching
bastards start barking at my
heels

HERRICK
You dont have anything to worry
about Glen When they cancel
the sports program in an American
high school itll be a sign of
the apocalypse

MEISTER
Well its nice to see you got
a sense of humor about the whole
thing

HERRICK
Sense of humor Look at me
Glen Im fifty-five years
old with no job not much
of anything really Ive never
owned a new car My savings
couldnt buy a week at a Holiday
Inn Im too young to retire
and too old to rock and roll
Im going to clean out my desk
and walk out of here -- and in
a few weeks this room will be
the home for Advanced Algebra
and no one will remember I was
ever here

Meister doesnt know what to say

MEISTER

You need any help here
HERRICK

No Thanks
MEISTER

Well hell Youll be

missed around here You know

There is an uncomfortable silence as Meister looks around
the room

MEISTER

HERRICK
Yeah youll see me around

Meister pauses a moment then leaves Herrick finishes with
the desk drawers and goes over to the record player There
is a stack of 45 records on the table next to it

Sorting through the records brings a nostalgic smile One
record even prompts a laugh He puts it on the turntable
turns on the record player and lifts the needle into the
scratchy groove

THE TRASHMEN
Well everybodys heard about
the bird
Well the bird bird bird
bird is a word
Well the bird bird bird
bird is a word

The opening lines of the stupidest rock song ever written or
sort of sung -- Surfin Bird by The Trashmen

EXT KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL DAY
Herrick parks his 62 Corvair convertible in the teachers

lot His name has been newly painted on the curb He smiles
Other cars pull in -- teachers and students going into their
respective lots

Brand new briefcase in hand Herrick approaches the school
entrance School buses pull up in front and discharge
students

Above the entrance the name of the school is being changed
James A Garfield is now just a shadow on the unfaded brick
The maintenance man is on a ladder scrubbing away the dirt
with a wire brush On the grass below the new letters are
laid out -- John F Kennedy There is no marquee on the
grass yet

Herrick enters the school with the flood of students

INT KENNEDY HIGH DAY

Herrick gets a few curious looks from the students as he
walks down the hall PRINCIPAL WOLTERS exits a classroom
sees Herrick

WOLTERS
Mr Herrick Morning

HERRICK
Good morning Principal Wolters
WOLTERS
No need to be so formal you
can call me Mr Wolters Did I

see you pull up in a Corvair
A Corvair son Didnt you
read Ralph Naders book

HERRICK
Yes sadly After I bought the
car And unless Mr Nader wants
to buy me a new one Ill have
to keep it until the wheels
fall off

WOLTERS
Which might not be too long
from now Have a good first
day Mr Herrick

Wolters slaps Herrick on the back and walks away Herrick
checks the room numbers and enters one

INT MUSIC ROOM

The same piano the same bust of Beethoven -- still white
faux marble A scale of notes above the blackboard -- the
rest of the room undecorated

Students drift in Herrick sets his briefcase on the desk
transfers some papers from it to an empty drawer He checks
the other drawers -- empty except for a stray pencil stub or
paper clip

He takes a music textbook from his briefcase and plops it
down on the desk He stares at it with the same enthusiasm
the students probably will

Turning to the blackboard he prints his name The bell rings
while he is still printing He takes a breath and turns to
face a classroom of kids

HERRICK
Good morning My name is Mr
Herrick and that is what I prefer
to be called Mr Herrick It
is a title of courtesy I will
extend that same courtesy to
you

Now it is the kids turn to sigh -- its going to be a long
year

INT CAFETERIA DAY

The teachers all eat at the same table Herrick approaches
and puts his tray down A couple of the other teachers nod
or smile in greeting

Principal Wolters patrols the cafeteria corralling a group
of teenage girls gossiping and giggling in a corner

Glen Meister 30 years younger sets his tray across from
Herrick A full head of hair flat stomach sportcoat over
his sweatshirt He runs his fingers through his hair and
slaps his stomach for emphasis as he talks

MEISTER
Hi we havent met yet Im
Glen Meister Phys Ed

HERRICK
That would account for the
whistle Carl Herrick Music

They shake Meister looks down at the whistle puzzled he
isnt very quick on the uptake

MEISTER
Yeah right Welcome to Gar
Kennedy Let me give you a
piece of advice this being
your first day

HERRICK
I know never let the students
get the upper hand

Herrick sees Wolters making the girls kneel on the floor

MEISTER
Nah thats a given A word to
the wise -- keep your hands off

the girls gym teacher

HERRICK
Pardon

MEISTER
Your predecessor Mr Bunte
was caught giving Miss Esparza
a beef injection on the Home Ec
room sofa They fired her cute
little butt

HERRICK
And him too of course

MEISTER
No it wasnt his fault She
was a flirt Bunte gota
reprimand out his wife hit him
with their Buick Hes in
Arizona recuperating and the
wife is in Chicago auditioning
lawyers Id guess

Wolters is measuring each of the girls skirts Several of
the skirts dont touch the floor when the girls kneel
Wolters barks and the skirts are unrolled at the waist until
they hit linoleum The girls are released their faces red
Wolters dress code radar spots one of the boys

WOLTERS
Mr Postma is that a pair of
dungarees

Wolters takes the boy by the elbow and escorts him out of
the cafeteria Herrick shakes his head

HERRICK
So keep my hands off the girls
gym teacher right

MEISTER
Thats the word though its
easier this year Thats her
there Miss Jacobs

MISS JACOBS a woman in shorts and a Garfield High School T-
shirt carries a tray toward their table Squat muscular
the shape of a fire hydrant she looks like a bulldog with
breasts

HERRICK
Ill try to control my lust

Meister laughs and slaps his stomach

INT MUSIC ROOM DAY
Herrick writes on the blackboard -- Lydian Model

HERRICK
The Lydian mode is equivalent
to the white keys on the piano
from F to F From this we get
the Ambrosian and Gregorian
modes Who can tell me where
the term Gregorian comes from

Herrick looks at the class -- they are in a severe trance of
boredom So is Herrick

HERRICK
Okay Pope Gregory the First
was trying to add to the variety
of church composition Since
the 4th Century there had only
been allowed

Hes not making things any better

EXT HERRICK HOUSE DAY

Herrick parks the Corvair in the driveway of a small house
As he gets out of the car and enters the house his briefcase
seems to drag him down Its been a long day

INT HERRICK HOUSE

IRIS HERRICK 20s and pretty hair always mussed kneels
behind a tripod-mounted camera Low to the floor the focus
of the camera is a baby on a scrap of carpet

The living room of the house is a photography studio lights
set up a large paper backdrop hanging from one wall --
everything crowded among a huge record collection and a small
piano

The baby wails tears streaming down its red face The
mother waits in the doorway

MOTHER
I dont understand this at all
Hes usually such a happy baby

Iris and the mother try to amuse the baby but to no avail

Herrick enters takes a look at the bawling kid

HERRICK
Perfect
He drops his briefcase Iris gives him a peck on the cheek
The mother shakes a rattle at the baby -- the baby grabs it

and throws it in her face

IRIS
How was your first day

HERRICK
As expected

HERRICK (CONTD)
I dont know what their last
teacher was doing but he wasnt
teaching music Well actually
I do know what he was doing
but these kids dont know a
barcarole from a barber shop
quartet

He goes into the bathroom and walks over to the sink -- there
is a pan of developer in it There is another on the back

of the toilet The shower has a string of 8 X 10s drying
and the window has been blacked out Herrick exits

Iris and the mother are making faces at the baby He screams
like a banshee

IRIS
Carl I dont know what a
barcarole is So it wasnta
good day How were the kids

HERRICK
Dolts A barcarole is a Venetian
boating song

He goes into the kitchen and runs water in the sink An
enlarger occupies the kitchen table

IRIS
At least your kids dont pee on
you Of course its only your
first day

He washes his face the splash of cold water is a relief

HERRICK
Thanks a whole lot
Eyes closed he feels around for a towel -- the rack is empty
Iris and the mother wave toys at the baby -- he tries for
high C

Herrick feeling blindly for a towel a doily anything --
walks toward the living room trips over his briefcase and
takes a header into the sofa

The baby stops crying -- and bursts into laughter
FLASH Iris snaps a few pictures
IRIS

Thanks hon

INT HERRICK HOUSE NIGHT

Herrick sits at the piano composing His dinner halfeaten
lays on a TV tray next to him Totally absorbed in making
notations on the composing paper he doesnt hear Iris
wearing a rubber apron over her clothes come out of the red-
lit bathroom She slips up behind him and kisses his ear

HERRICK
Oooh what is that perfume
madame Eau de developer fluid
That always makes my blood race

IRIS
I made thirty-two dollars today
(beat )
Was it really so bad at school
HERRICK
Its a job Thats what it is
a job
IRIS

Well its only for two years
Then you can take a year off

and write your little old heart
out After that the New York
Philharmonic and the world debut
of Carl Herricks American

Opus Then a command
performance for the President
the Queen of England The Ed

Sullivan Show Then someday
after all those years of
struggle if youre really lucky
youll be able to hear your
music on an elevator or ina
dentists office

Shes teasing him -- she does it a lot He smiles and kisses
her

HERRICK
With motivation like that how
can I fail

IRIS
You need some motivation

HERRICK
Twelve more bars and Im your
fella

IRIS
Youre my fella no matter how
many bars you hang out in

She kisses him again and goes back to the bathroom He turns
back to the piano

INT MUSIC ROOM DAY
Herrick teaches his class

HERRICK
If you combine two or more
melodies within a composition
you are using what is called a
counterpoint There are a
variety of types of
counterpoint

He goes through the motions -- the students do even less

INT HERRICK HOUSE NIGHT

Iris works at the kitchen table hand tinting a black and
white baby picture

Herrick sits at the piano trying to work He stretches

goes over to his record collection and finds an album He
puts it on the stereo and plays some early Lester Young --
then a little Dave Brubeck -- tasty jazz He listens to

only a few bars then hurries back to the piano and plays

The few notes dont copy Young and Brubeck but take the
music to another level He makes notations totally absorbed

Iris watches him and smiles

INT REHEARSAL ROOM DAY

A kid does the scales on his trombone Herrick listens with
all the patience he can muster one eye on the clock

HERRICK
All right all right Perry
Nice tones but you need a little
work on the right hand Practice
the right hand so it flows
Youre jerking to each note --
flow

The kid packs up and leaves

Herrick slumps worn out

HERRICK

GERTRUDE

clarinet

HERRICK
Do you have a clarinet Miss
Van Lente

GERTRUDE

She opens a case and shows him her clarinet

HERRICK
This is a very beautiful
instrument Why did you pick
it The clarinet

GERTRUDE
I saw one on Lawrence Welk It
was pretty -- the sound I mean
HERRICK

Thats as good a reason as any

GERTRUDE
None I cant even read music
But Im determined

Herrick sighs

INT HERRICK HOUSE NIGHT

That gets a smile from him

INT GYMNASIUM DAY

There is a stage at one end of the gym a circle of aspiring
musicians in chairs on it and music stands

to conduct the auditions

Herrick tries

It is a music lovers hell

The notes are flat discordant downright ugly Then a
flutist plays sweetly enough to bring a smile to Herricks
face But right after that is a trumpet player who bleats

like an injured goat

And it goes on and on

Gertrude tries out and fails -- she has a long way to go
The accordion player beams as he lays into Lady of Spain
Herrick just watches frowning The kid stops puzzled
then launches into a polka grinning hugely Herrick grabs
the accordion to stop him

INT MUSIC ROOM DAY
Herrick passes out graded test papers
HERRICK

Im very disappointed in the
whole lot of you These papers

are dismal This is all
simple stuff basic music history
and theory

The kids look at their grades with the same disgust

HERRICK
Whats going on here Am I
talking to myself I might as
well be

Herrick sits behind his desk and looks at the kids A few
stare back in rebellion

HERRICK
Fine this works Why mess
around with all of that paperwork
for nothing Ill stare at you
and you stare at me and well
accomplish just about as much
as when I lecture Your grade
point might even improve

The silence goes on for a long uncomfortable moment They
are saved by the bell

HERRICK
Class dismissed You can go
but I expect things to be
different tomorrow Understand
me

It falls on deaf ears The room is vacated instantly and
Herrick packs up his briefcase and leaves

The hall is emptying quickly kids grabbing their jackets

slamming locker doors full of energy for leaving Hey
schools out

Herrick passes the rehearsal rooms two cramped sound-proof
rooms -- semi-sound-proof He hears the pained notes of a
clarinet Herrick opens the door and sees Gertrude

HERRICK
Give it up Miss Van Lente
schools out

Herrick startles her He smiles and closes the door The
clarinet scales continue as he walks away quickly Principal
Wolters stops him

WOLTERS
Mr Herrick just the man I was
looking for We are forming a
textbook committee for next
years curriculum and I was
hoping for your ideas

HERRICK
Is this voluntary or required

WOLTERS
Its totally voluntary but
most important Mr Herrick

HERRICK
Then I pass Mr Wolters I
have a rule -- unless I get

paid for it I dont do it

WOLTERS
Mr Herrick do you have another
job after school hours I know
a teachers salary isnt what
it should be but

HERRICK
No I dont have a second job
and I agree on the salary Can
I go now

WOLTERS
Ive been watching you Mr
Herrick Its my job to keep
an eye on my teachers Ive
never seen a teacher who ran
out of here after the last period
with the enthusiasm of one of
our students I wish I could
observe some of that enthusiasm
in your classroom work

HERRICK
Mr Wolters I write at night --
compose Im writing a symphony

Im here on time in the morning
and I do my job

WOLTERS
Teaching is a twenty-four hour
job Mr Herrick

HERRICK
Not unless you pay me for it
Mr Wolters Good night

Herrick starts to walk away

WOLTERS
Mr Herrick You havent been
excused yet

Herrick stops and looks at Wolters

HERRICK
Am I being made to stay after
school

WOLTERS
I was wrong about this being a
job -- teaching is more These
young people your students
are at a crossroads in their
lives Confused hormones going
berserk faced with monumental
decisions that will change their
lives forever And we try to
pump them full of dates and
formulas figures and data
that have little to do with

real life -- very little of it
takes

(beat )
But it all adds up toa

human being with wants needs
ideals and hopes You have
two jobs Pump them full of
data music data in your case
And give them a compass Point
them in the right direction so
it doesnt all go to waste
You manage to do that and they
will remember you for the rest
of their lives I dont know
how youre doing with the data
input but as a compass youre
useless

Well I dont hear the call

Wolters lets Herrick pass

INT HERRICK HOUSE NIGHT

Herrick makes meatloaf while Iris works with the enlarger
He massages the egg and bread crumbs into the hamburger with
more vigor than necessary

HERRICK
I hate that man and I hate his
school The work is boring and
the kids are ignorant and
determined to stay that way

IRIS
Let me do that Carl
HERRICK
No I cant write when I feel
like this I need to decompress
IRIS

Well its taking longer for
you to decompress every night
Its getting a little tired
hon You dont see me grousing
because I spend my days with
bawling babies and persnickety
mothers

HERRICK
Thats different you like it

IRIS
Yes because I go into it saying
Im going to have fun I look
at every baby as if its the
first one I ever saw -- as if
it were my own And I pretend

HERRICK
Theres more to music than the
notes on the paper

He lowers the needle and the unmistakable sounds of The
Kingsmen belting out Louie Louie fill the room

Gertrude looks at the turntable at Herrick dumbfounded

HERRICK
Listen These fellas have
absolutely no harmonic sense
They cant sing the lead singer
is yelling Theyre playing
the same boring three chords
over and over and over The
recording sucks The lyrics
are awful when you can understand
them if you can hear them
This song is about a decibel
away from being noise But we

love it I love it Do you
love it
Gertrude nods Herrick is on a roll
HERRICK

Why Ill tell you why Because
it has heart These guys are
playing with everything they

have and theyre having fun

They love it so we love it

HERRICK
Gertrude you go home and pick
up your clarinet and play from

INT MUSIC ROOM DAY
Herrick stands in front of the classroom of dull faces

HERRICK
Put your textbooks away Okay
how many of you like music

After a moment a couple of hesitant hands are raised

HERRICK
How many of you like the Beach
Boys

The kids look at each other and all the hands go up

HERRICK
How many of you like this Beach
Boys song

He puts a 45 on the record player and Surfin USA starts
to play The kids are roused from their trance

HERRICK
How many of you knew that
Surfing USA was a rip-off of
a song by Chuck Berry

He changes the record and Sweet Little sixteen plays
Some of the kids bounce to the music and all are paying
attention

HERRICK
How many of you like this song
from a new English pop group
called The Animals

He plays House of the Rising Sun

HERRICK
Did you know that this is a
copy of a version by Bob Dylan
that Dylan based on a folk song
by Josh White This song may
be over a hundred years old

American music has a very proud
history Very little music
stands alone Every once ina

most are influenced by their
forebears by every song they

youre not even aware of We
are going to explore that
history You may think this is
unique

He lays the needle on Surfin Bird by the Trashmen

HERRICK
but I can show you a direct
link from the jazz scat singers
of the 30s to the doo-wop sound
of the 50s and 60s to this

He lets the song play for a moment

HERRICK
This catchy but inane repetition
of bird bird bird bird is a
word disintegrates into boppa-
boppa-boppa-boppa-oo-mau-mau-
mau-boppa-oo-mau-mau-mau

He takes the needle off

HERRICK
Well maybe thats a bigger
leap of style than we should
attempt right now Lets go
back to the Beach Boys and Chuck
Berry Chuck Berry is one of
the founders of rock and roll
Rock and roll has its origins
in rhythm and blues They go
back to the blues So today we
will explore the blues

He puts on an old Muddy Waters song

HERRICK
One of the characteristics of
the blues is that it uses the
diatonic scale

He starts writing on the blackboard

minor scales but staying in

of the diatonic scale is the

this already -- does anyone
know what a chromatic scale is

He smiles -- this could be fun

In this class we will study the
history of music Not just
that classical long-hair stuff
but American music too Folk
blues rock jazz country and
pop Some of these forms are
uniquely American but our study
will be unbiased All music is
good music Some is formal
some is complicated some even
more complicated but remember
music is communication
Not necessarily communication
of information but of emotion
feeling mood And if any piece
of music any type of music
makes you feel something -- it
works Now how many of you
like this new British group
the Beatles

All the hands shoot up

HERRICK
Well before the Beatles wrote
Yesterday Help A Hard
Days Night or any of their
other great songs they covered --

remade -- songs by other people
How many of you have heard this
song

He puts the needle down on Roll over Beethoven and lets

play for a moment

HERRICK
This is their cover of a song
by Chuck Berry

He plays a minute of the Chuck Berry version

HERRICK
Chuck Berry is one of the fathers
of rock and roll He comes
from a background influenced by
country and blues Now the
blues twelvebar blues is a
form of music quite unique to
America One of the
characteristics of the blues is
the use of the diatonic scale

in rows at one end of the field The football team practices

in one row drums at the back etc but the rows wont come
out even and he gives up on that

He takes his position at the front of the band raises the
baton and gives the signal to march The kids start walking
some left foot first some right It looks like hell

He stops them and tries again -- a little better -- a little
better still -- until they finally march in unison
Herrick orders a left turn -- immediate chaos Kids hit

each other with their instruments trip over their own feet
and pretty soon the whole band is down

The football players laugh

Herrick gets them to set their instruments aside then back
in rows They start marching once more He orders a right
turn -- more chaos even without instruments

Ed youre a bright kid and

But these unexplained absences

Ed doesnt know how to respond He looks at the floor
Herrick waits him out also looking at the floor

Then he sees it -- Ed Claypools shoes Old ratty tennis
shoes with holes through the canvas rubber peeling In the
relative warmth of the trailer the snow on them has melted
and water squishes out of the holes

Ed sees Herrick staring at his shoes He panics embarrassed --
he looks like he might cry

Herrick looks away self-consciously -- and sees EDNA the
boys eight-year-old sister as she steps out of a small
closet

EDNA

She points toward the bathroom Herrick cant help looking
at her feet -- worn out tennis shoes

paraphrasing a popular rock
song So as not to offend the
more conservative members of
our audience I would like to
remind them that this song was
originally recorded by the folk
singer Pete Seeger If even
that offends you Id like to
point out that the words were
taken from the Book of
Ecclesiastes the Old Testament
To everything there is a
season turn turn turn And
a time for every purpose under
heaven
A time to gain a time to lose
A time to rend a time to sew
A time to love a time to hate
A time for peace I swear its

A banner is hung over the stage -- Concert for the Hearing

Impaired

The orchestra is setting up on the stage Microphones have
been placed in front of each section
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 109

The usual folding chairs have been moved back from the stage
leaving room for two rows of huge Marshall speakers On top
of each speaker is a plywood platform with a chair

Cole and other deaf children are shown to the chairs on the
speakers The rest of the audience take their places toward
the back

The orchestra is soon ready and Herrick steps to the podium
A sign language interpreter stands to one side of the stage

HERRICK
Thank you all for coming
Tonight is an experiment I

hope it works I had prepared
a big speech about the importance
of music in our world but it
went on for pages and pages
So I decided the best way to
explain music to the hearing
impaired is to give it to you
and let you make of it what you
will

(beat )
Our first selection this evening
is by George Gershwin Rhapsody
in Blue In this music Gershwin
was trying to give us his
impression of the city of New
York Here we go

He faces the orchestra and raises his baton And the music
begins From the instruments into the microphones through
the amplifiers and out of the Marshall speakers The chairs
on top of the speakers vibrate with the music

The gorgeous Gershwin sound fills the room

Cole holds onto his chair and his eyes widen He and the
other kids look at each other And each one begins to smile
They can feel the music It courses through their bodies

Herrick looks over his shoulder at Cole -- its working
The deaf children begin to sway to the music

HERRICK
And uh for the hearing impaired
in our audience this may be
the one time you are grateful
for your hearing difficulties --
I am going to sing To the
hearing portion of our audience
my profound apologies

A ripple of laughter runs through the audience Iris is
stunned
HERRICK
And on a personal note

Id like to dedicate this to my
son Cole

Herrick nods to the student conductor The music begins
Herrick begins to sing -- not a good voice but sincere

HERRICK

(singing)
Close your eyes Have no fear
The monsters gone Hes on
the run and your daddys here
Beautiful
Beautiful beautiful
Beautiful boy

As Herrick sings he signs the words He sings to Cole
whose eyes well with tears Iris is crying

Herrick stumbles here and there but he manages to sing and
sign the words of this touching tribute by John Lennon to
his son

While youre busy
Making other plans

persuaded to make their
professional debut right here
at Kennedy High Ladies and
gentlemen the Sex Dwarfs

And the curtain parts to show Schiff Goodrich and Groves
in their leather best Guitar bass and drums

They launch into Louie Louie -- particularly raucous and
obnoxious but faithful somehow to both Black Flag and the
Kingsmen

Principal Kiernan and Coach Meister both turn on Herrick
who beams proudly

INT HERRICK HOUSE DAY

Herrick is reading the Michigan Motor Vehicle Code newly
revised for 1981

Cole walks in and out humming something that sounds barely
like Gershwin out of key preoccupied

INT MUSIC ROOM 1994

Herrick takes the glass treble clef off the window deep in
thought He is jerked back to the present by the Corvair
pulling up outside

The Corvair has been restored beautifully perfectly A
twenty-eight year-old Cole gets out of it He sees Herrick
at the window

He bows and waves his hand at the Corvair -- Ta Dah

Herrick claps his hands so Cole can see He puts the treble
clef in the box and looks around the room

Iris is sitting in the back working on a needlepoint project

The gymnasium is full crammed to the rafters with students

There is a banner over the stage -- Good-bye Mr Herrick

Herrick is overwhelmed Meister takes his briefcase and
Principal Kiernan escorts him toward the stage

People reach out of the audience to shake his hand Soon we
recognize older versions of Schiff Goodrich Groves --
Lohman Ed Claypool Yntema then Tidd -- maybe a very womanly
Rowena near the back

Mrs Kiernan leads Herrick up the steps to the stage to the
podium in front of the band

A stunned Herrick looks for Iris She and Cole wink at him

The applause finally dies down and Mrs Kiernan addresses
the crowd

MRS KIERNAN
Ive only been here what
thirteen years already But

MRS KIERNAN (CONTD)

We were going to buy you
something Carl a watch or
whatever We asked your wife
Iris what you might want or
need she was no help at all

(beat )
The one thing she did mention
was your writing And I remember
all those school board meetings
faculty meetings and so on I
always saw you scribbling away
what I thought were pertinent
notes but I looked over your
shoulder once and discovered it
was quarter-notes and flats I
was so glad when you finished
the damned thing so you could
concentrate on your teaching
again

There is good-nature laughter from the audience

MRS KIERNAN
Seriously though I dont think
I have ever come across a more
dedicated selfless teacher
The only way we can ever pay
you back is to perform for the
first time The American Opus
by Carl Herrick

She hands him the baton He turns to the orchestra

The instruments are poised and ready

He looks down at the music stand

The sheet music is a copy of the original in his handwriting
The American Opus by Carl Herrick He touches the sheets
of music looks at Iris His Iris He loves this woman
She motions him to get on with it

Then raises the baton taps it once on the music stand and
the orchestra plays The opening strains of the music
fill the gym

Herricks face glows and his chest fills with pride

There is a quiet murmur in the audience behind him It gets
louder disrupting the music Herrick looks over his

shoulder

Two Highway Patrolmen can be seen in the back of the
gymnasium
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 119

The murmur in the audience increases A few words are
audible The Governor Its the Governor Here

Where I cant see Look over there
Herrick drops his baton and the music peters out

The two Highway Patrolmen walk down the aisle ahead of a
middle-aged woman in glasses She is followed by two more
Highway Patrolmen and a couple of staff members

She strides up the stage Principal Kiernan takes the podium
startled

MRS KIERNAN
Ladies and gentlemen may I
present our Governor and
former Kennedy High School
alumna the Most Honorable
Gertrude Van Lente

By God it is Gertrude She takes the microphone waits for
the applause to die down

GERTRUDE
Thank you Principal Kiernan
Im sorry I arrived late and
spoiled the music but well
get right back to it I came
here today to say my thanks to
Mr Carl Herrick I remember
him well He had a great
influence on my life Ona lot
of lives I know And I have
the feeling that Mr Herrick
considers a great part of his
life was misspent He wrote
this symphony of his to be
performed possibly to make him
famous or rich probably both
That is the American dream
that is how we measure success
by being rich and famous On
that scale Mr Herrick is a
failure -- but I think he has
achieved a success beyond riches
and fame Look around you Mr
Herrick There is not a life
in this room that you have not
touched And each one is a
better person for meeting you
or being your student This is
your symphony Mr Herrick
These people are the notes and
melodies of your opus And
this is the music of your life
Converted to PDF by wwwscreentalkorg 120

The audience gives Herrick a standing ovation He looks out
at the audience each face a memory a moment of his life

GERTRUDE
One last thing Mr Herrick
As long as I am Governor of
this State there will always be
a Music Program in the High
Schools Lets get back to the
music Mr Herrick

Herrick steadies himself and goes back to the orchestra He
raises the baton The music begins again

It is a great symphony with elements of jazz rock country
tin pan alley and classical Gertrude goes over to one of
the girls playing the clarinet and whispers in her ear

And she takes the clarinet takes the students seat and
plays

Then out of the audience one or two at a time other adults
approach the stage and -- one by one -- replace the students
in the orchestra

Eventually the orchestra is composed completely of adults

Herrick cries openly as he leads them

And in the audience resting in Iris lap is the needlepoint --
words encircled by twining ivy --

Life Is What Happens
While You Are Making
Other Plans

THE END
