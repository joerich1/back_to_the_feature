love with my mother and my mother
falling in love with me And if

INT DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER

One of Moms students JIM tells a story while the group
sits around the table eating

JIM
---SO anyway we figured out a way
to rig up our iPods to the external
speakers on the ASV So every time
we come rolling into town you knew
the 456 was there cause we were
bumping House of Pain It was like
Jump around Jump around And the
whole familys coming outside and
you got the kids and the mom and the
dad and theyre all bouncing up and
down Were throwing out candies
for the kids and soccer balls and
Beanie Babies and Frisbees Um
like smokes for the adults And
they loved they absolutely loved
Gatorade But for some reason you
know they hated the lemon-lime
flavor I dont know what it was
Yeah Couldnt give it away

The group laughs

MOM
How long were you over there
JIM
Uhh I did two tours in Iraq and
one in Bosnia
MOM
Wow
MASON

Did you enlist

JIM
Mm-hmm Yeah I was um Army
National Guard And uh you know
coming straight out of high school
Needed money for college Seemed
like a decent paying job And uh
did my tour And whenever I got
done I told them if theres you
know a world-changing event Ill
come back And uh 3 months later
911 happened And I was back 912
And Im proud to say the 456 the
whole time we were there we never
lost a guy Not one casualty

MOM
But is that odd Is that unusual

JIM
Yeah Almost impossible Like the
guys that came along after us and
replaced us they didnt listen to
any of our advice They you know
did basically the polar opposite of
what we did and they lost seven
guys in the first month

MOM
Wow What did you guys do
differently

JIM

Well Id like to think its just a
matter of mutual respect you know
I mean all the time we spent over
there building trust I mean these
guys basically destroyed it in three
days

PROFESSOR DOUGLAS
So what did the locals think about
why we were there

JIM
Oil Plain and simple

California paid twenty-two grand for

investment You know Soon as you

car on your hands and the values
only dropping from there

of it and I can do whatever I want
with it Alright Im sorry if you
had other ideas about it but when
you get older you can save up and
buy a car of your own And be cool

much of the solo stuff it kind of
becomes a drag you know But you
put ‘em next to each other alright

other and then you can hear it
Huh Its The Beatles You know

MASON
I dont know I think I always just
liked Paul the best

DAD
It doesnt matter you know youre
missing the point There is no
favorite Beatle Thats what Im
saying Its in the balance Thats
what made them the greatest fucking
rock band in the world Okay You
know and theres this decade of
music out there thats been scattered
Alright

arranged and ordered for you by

looking at things in a really unique
way Got a lot of natural talent

MASON
Thanks

TURLINGTON
Yeah but that and fifty cents will
just get you a cup of coffee in this
old world Ive met a lot of talented
people over the years How many of
them made it professionally without
discipline commitment and a really
good work ethic

Mason shrugs and shakes his head unsure

TURLINGTON (CONTD)
I can tell you I can count it on
two fingers Zero Its not gonna
happen for you Mason The world is
too competitive There are too many
talented people who are willing to
work hard And a butt-load of morons
who are untalented who are more
than willing to surpass you Asa
matter of fact a lot of them are
sitting in that classroom out there
right now Hm You know what theyre
doing Theyre doing their
assignments which is what youre
supposed to be doing but youre
not Youre in here Why is that

Mason exits
EXT HIGHWAY - DAY INT TRUCK

Suburban Wars plays Mason drives Sheena is in the
passenger seat

SHEENA
That sounds to me like just
another extreme Mason view of
everything

MASON
Not at all I finally figured it
out Its like when they realized
it was gonna be too expensive to
actually build cyborgs and robots
I mean the costs of that were
impossible They decided to just
let humans turn themselves into
robots Thats whats going on right
now

SHEENA
Oh right now

MASON
Yeah I mean why not There are
billions of us just laying around
not really doing anything We dont
cost anything I mean were even
pretty good at self-maintenance and
reproducing constantly And as it
turns out were already biologically
programmed for our little cyborg
upgrades

SHEENA
How

MASON
Seriously I read this thing other
day about how like when you hear
that ding on your inbox you get a
like a dopamine rush in your brain
Its like were being chemically
rewarded for allowing ourselves to
be brainwashed How evil is that
Were fucked

SHEENA
So you deleting your Facebook page
is gonna change all that Remember
when Trevor deleted his Facebook
page last year and everyone just
hated him You made more fun of him
than anyone

MASON
I still make fun of Trevor though

SHEENA
But it looked like he was so
pathetically desperate for attention
Or to be different or something

MASON
Thats just ‘cause they did that
lame story about it in the school
paper

SHEENA
And then he had to make a big
announcement about it when he came
back a month later

MASON
Thats the thing though Im not
doing it for attention I just want
to try and not live my life through
a screen I want like some kind
of actual interaction A real person
not just the profile they put up

Sheenas looking at her phone
SHEENA
Oh Im sorry Were you saying

something

She laughs

MASON
Yeah okay I know youre joking
but I mean its kinda true you
have been you know checking your
phone this whole time and so what
are you really doing You dont
care what your friends are up to on
Saturday afternoon but youre also
obviously not fully experiencing my
profound bitching so its like
everyones just stuck in like an
in-between state Not really
experiencing anything

SHEENA

information Look for example I
just got the address of the club
where were meeting them later so

Austin lost for an hour tonight

experience

SHEENA

transformative I just see it as
the next step

MASON

INT ANTONES - EVENING

Mason and Dad are wandering through the green room area while
the band is doing a sound check

DAD
---So it sucks I mean the guys a
college lacrosse player I mean
what are you gonna do

MASON
She didnt even like sports

An iced-down bucket of drinks beckons

DAD
You want a beer

MASON
No thats alright

DAD
You can have one

MASON
Its okay

They continue their conversation out of the green room to a
little area overlooking the stage

DAD
Yeah well for what its worth
weve all been through the exact
same thing at one point or another

MASON
Its not the same though I mean
you never got to know her

DAD
No I know I know Its not the
same

MASON

I just dont know what I did wrong

At this point Dad yells down to Jimmy his roommate from
years before briefly interrupting the sound check

DAD
Hey Jimmy Hey man Hey --

JIMMY
Hey Mason

DAD
Were up here raiding the green room
Hope thats okay

JIMMY
Thats totally cool

DAD
Alright

JIMMY
Wow Is that MJ

DAD
Uh-huh Right

JIMMY
Unbelievable

DAD
Well we just decided to come a little
early check you out

JIMMY
Thats cool man let me finish up
Ill be up in a minute

DAD
Alright alright

He and Mason slowly start to drift around the venue

DAD (CONTD)
(back to Mason)
I guarantee you you didnt do
anything wrong These high school
love things they never work out
Here come here
(MORE )

DAD (CONTD)
I mean everyones just changing so
much The odds of two young people
staying on the same wavelength are

MASON
Yeah but still --

DAD
Look and I also guarantee you that
every day of your life that you spend
crying over some silly girl is a
complete waste of time

MASON
She wasnt a silly girl though I
mean shes a serious person I
really thought we were --

DAD
What

MASON
I dont know

DAD
Heres the truth Women are never
satisfied Ok Theyre always
looking to potentially trade up and
thats Im sorry to say what I
think has happened to you my fine
feathered friend

MASON
What does that even mean

DAD
It means dont hand over the controls
to your self-esteem to Sheila

MASON
Sheena

DAD
Alright It means you are responsible
for you not your girlfriend not
your mom not me You And if you
truly take care of you you will be
amazed at how much girls like Sheena
start lining up at your front door

MASON
Great

DAD
Yeah you know you just gotta
separate yourself from the pack in
some way Excel at something you
know and then you have your pick of
the litter when them front-running
hussies start sniffing around

MASON
So what youre saying is I should
take up lacrosse

DAD
Exactly Or you could you know
start a band Worked for me a long
time ago I think its still working
for Jimmy Or you just keep taking

pictures

MASON
She hated the pictures I took of
her

DAD

Alright Im sick to death of her
okay I only met her a few times
and yes she was cute alright But
truth be told I always thought she
was a little bit you know a little
bit too square for you Yknow not
quite the same vibe

MASON
You really thought that

DAD
On some subtle lower level I mean
uh I wasnt surprised when it turned
out she was interested in some
knucklehead lacrosse player okay
I mean bottom line is its all
timing with these things Yknow
I mean uh take your mom and me
Yknow I think I probably turned
into the boring castrated guy she
wanted me to be fifteen or twenty
years ago yknow And man Im not
saying she was wrong to be pissed
Im not Im just saying that yknow
she could have been a little more
patient a little more forgiving

MASON
Wouldve saved me that parade of
drunken assholes

Dad gestures zipping his lip saying nothing

MASON (CONTD)
So whats the point

DAD
Of what

MASON
I dont know any of this
Everything

DAD

Everything Whats the point I
mean I sure as shit dont know I
mean but neither does anybody else
Okay were all just winging it you
know I mean the good news is youre
feeling stuff You know And you
got to hold onto that You do I
mean you get older and you dont

feel as much Youre skin gets
tougher The point is those pictures
you took Thousands of submissions
from all over the state and you won

MASON
Well I got silver And nine other
people did too

DAD
Im gonna kill you Im tryin to
tell you that I believe in you
Mason I think youre really special
and if some girl doesnt see that
then fuck her yknow

Jimmys at the mic

JIMMY (0S)
Hey this next one goes out to a
young man in the house --

EXT APARTMENT - MORNING
Mason now with a scruffy beard is wedging a duffel bag and

bin into the bed of his truck He walks back toward Moms
new apartment

INT APARTMENT - MORNING

Mason is packing a box in mid-conversation with Mom who is
seated in another room

MASON
-Isnt that kind of crazy though
that a computer knows who you are
from just twenty questions off a
form I guess there are really only
like eight types of people in the
world

Mom goes to the kitchen and pours coffee into a mug

MASON (CONTD)

I mean there are subsets like male
and female but apparently were not
as unique as we want to think we

are

MOM
Have you even talked to this guy
yet

MASON

No but weve been trading emails
He seems pretty cool Hes studying
literature and uh anthropology
and hes way into Bright Eyes so
thats not so bad But anyways he
was telling me about how the system
they use for assigning roommates is
kind of spooky Like the Freshmen
satisfaction rate for new roommates
used to be like 60 and now its
100 Just cause of the computer

MOM
Well Sounds like hell be a good
roommate then

MASON
Yeah But weve pretty much decided
that soon they wont even need a
questionnaire Because theyll just
let the NSA scan your digital ghost
and theyll tell you who your roommate
is based on everything youve ever
said written or clicked

Mason walks back into the living room carrying a box He
holds up a framed picture

MASON (CONTD)
Did you -- Did you put this in here
again

Mom laughs

MASON (CONTD)

MOM
