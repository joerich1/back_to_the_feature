INT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - NEW YORK - DAY

New immigrant families stand in ticket lines next to body

pierced teens Dozens of languages fly through the air none
of them English This is the Crossroads of the world for the
down and out hard luck and New York on 5 dollars a day crowd

Witness to it all is a greybearded BLACK HOMELESS VETERAN who
sits with his prosthetic leg parked beside him

VET

Dollar fo a homeless vet Help out
a homeless vet

(as a student with a

duffel bag hurries past)
Cmon lil man - I fought the war
with your Daddy Pnam Pen Yall

A young SWEDISH COUPLE with backpacks catch his eye

VET (CONTD)

Yo Swiss Miss - lets see that snile
How ‘bout you Fritz I know yall got
a wallet in that backpack
Freeloadin mother-

(stops midword as an

Asian family with many

bundles passes by)
Heyyy Jackie Chan Shanghai Noon
I take travelers checks Yeah
arrigato to you too

He pauses for a moment with a curious expression aS someone
else catches his eye

A BEAM OF HAZY SUNLIGHT shines down through one of the high
arched windows of the terminal building

onto a MAN Or an apparition

The VET squints closely

as the FIGURE seems to emerge from the sunlight Dark
Wraparound SUNGLASSES mark his Placid face “He wears corduroy
pants a faded denim shirt And though he carries no luggage
bis cheap canvas shoes look like theyve got some miles on
them

We will come to know this man as PROT For now he just
stands there taking everything in with the fascination of a
tourist as the crowd bustles around him

Suddenly - in front of the rest rooms -

TWO YOUNG THUGS bump into a Middle-aged RUSSIAN WOMAN One
wrenching her SUITCASE away - the other knocking her down

As she screams for help they run off -
shoving past PROT and into the crowd Prot watches them for
a moment as if unsure whether to register anger or
caution Then he turns to the woman

She is on the ground dazed and sobbing while everyone steps
quickly around her

Prot approaches her The vet keeping a careful eye on hin

Prot stops standing over the woman She looks up at his dark

glasses stocky shoulders fearfully But as he holds his
hand out and offers a Smile her fear is strangely allayed

PROT
Here let me help you

The CRACKLE of WALKIE-TALKIES interrupt as two TRANSIT COPS
hurry over

1ST OFFICER
Hold it right there

VET
Oh man - he aint done nothin
The OFFICERS nevertheless regard Prot with suspicion

1ST OFFICER
Step away from her

PROT

2ND OFFICER
Maam what happened

The woman struggles with limited English

WOMAN

2ND OFFICER

PROT

A wry understanding moves across both officers faces

IST OFFICER

2ND OFFICER

PROT
(polite in return)

As Prot is led away the VET straps on his leg and gets

himself up For some strange reason he feels an affinity with
Prot

EXT GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

As Prot is led outside His dark glasses take in the noisy
chaos of New York with amazement

The VET hobbles out the doors as PROT is placed in a POLICE

How the hell can you be unresponsive
to 300 milligrams of thorazine Its
impossible

Chakraborty looks over his bifocals at Powell

CHAKRABORTY
Thats why theyve sent him to you

Powell takes in Chakrabortys look for a moment Then with
a frown looks back down at the FILE

POWELL
Terrific No ID No Missing Persons
reports matching his description
Then baffled Powell lifts up from the file a sheet of
notebook paper handwritten in pencil of the most astounding
alien-looking HIEROGLYPHICS

canvas shoes as we saw him in before

He smiles from behind his dark glasses at Powell

Navarro a big bearish Puerto Rican reassures Powell with a
nod and a bandaged thumbs up

NAVARRO
This ones gentle as a pussycat Doc

Powell nevertheless keeps a careful eye on Prot who remains
standing as Navarro and Simms exit closing the door

Powell motions to one of two CHAIRS

POWELL
Wont you have a seat

PROT
Have a seat curious expression

As they both slowly sit Powell probes Prots sunglasses

POWELL

again)

(correcting him
pronouncing it like
goat)

Prot

POWELL
I see Well Prot Were here to
talk Im going to ask you some
questions If you feel like answering
them you may
(as genuinely as he can)
I want you to fee comfortable

Prot reaches for a bowl of FRUIT on the desk beside them

PROT
Thank you May I

Powell considers the request a little wary

POWELL
Please
Prot picks an APPLE admiring it
PROT

Red Delicious you call this variety
My favorite

Powell watches as Prot takes a bite with a rapturous sigh
POWELL
Id like to begin by asking if you
know why youre here

PROT
Of course You think Im crazy

Powell stares as Prot devours the apple core and all

Rev 11300 (Blue) 12

From behind
smile

POWELL
We prefer to use the term ill
(forcing a smile)

Do you think you are ili
PROT
A little homesick perhaps
POWELL
(careful)

Really And where is home

POWELL
(studying him)

PROT
Capital K- hyphen - capitals P-Ax
Roughly translated into your Roman

(starting in on another
apple)
K-PAX is a planet

Powell contemplates the conviction with which this was just

said When

Prot suddenly laughs

PROT (CONTD)
Dont worry Im not going to leap
out of your chest

POWELL
Oh Im not worried its just that
Im only familiar with nine Planets

PROT

(between bites)
Actually there are ten but that
doesnt matter - Im not from your
solar system K-PAX is about a
thousand of your light years from
here Near what you call your
Constellation LYRA

POWELL
(raising an eyebrow)
Quite a ways Im curious how did
you get to Earth

Rev 11300 (Blue) 13

PROT
Thats somewhat difficult to explain

POWELL
Try me

Prot pauses from eating trying to think of how to put it

PROT
Its a matter of harnessing the energy
of light
(sees Powell is not going
to get it)

I know that sounds - crazy to you
You beings are eons away from
discovering light travel

Powell watches as Prot raises a hand so that his fingers
touch the hazy SUNLIGHT filtering through the window blinds

POWELL
You travel at the speed of light

PROT
Oh no We can travel many times that
speed various multiples of c
(laughs)
Otherwise the trip here would have
taken me about a thousand years now
wouldnt it have

Powell tries to couch his puzzled amusement with seriousness

POWELL
What if I were to tell you - that
according to a man who lived on our
planet named Einstein nothing can
travel faster than the speed of light

Prot looks at Powell with an astute smile

PROT

I would say you misunderstand
Einstein Doctor Powell - may I call
you Mark

(getting chummy)
What your Einstein said Mark was
that nothing can accelerate to the
speed of light because its mass would
become infinite Einstein said
nothing about entities alread
traveling at the speed of light or
faster - at tachyon speeds

Powell stares back at him at a complete loss

POWELL
Tachyon

PROT
Entities traveling faster than the
Speed of light are called tachyons
You can look it up

POWELL
(getting a little peeved)
Thank you I will

Prot watches Powell jot down something with his Montblanc pen

PROT
I detect a note of skepticism Doctor
Powell

POWELL

Not at all Its just that - you
speak English so well Im amazed

PROT
Its not a very difficult language to
rearn You should try speaking wxljqz2-
pit

Powell puts his pen down even more amazed at the guttural
clicks and sounds that just came out of Prots mouth

POWELL
Ima little confused Maybe you
could explain to me how it is - asa
visitor from space - you look so much
like me - or any other Earth person

PROT
(patiently)
Why is a soap bubble round

POWELL
(perplexedly)
Why is a soap bubble round

PROT
For an educated person you repeat
things quite a bit Mark aA soap
bubble is round because that is the
most energyefficient configuration
Similarly°on this planet I look like
you on KPAX I look like a K-PAXian

Powell has had just about enough of this

Rev 120700 (Cherry) 15-15B

POWELL
One more question - Prot
(glancing at the clock)
Why did you want to come to Earth

PROT
(finishing apple 2)
Pure curiosity I had never been to

Look Im not Saying that medication
cant be a useful tool to help someone
like this but --

FLEEN
He might be a good subject for the

clinical trial here

POWELL
You want to experiment on him before
we have a diagnosis

FLEEN
You have some better idea

POWELL
Hes not a danger to anyone How
about getting to know him first

FLEEN
You know Mark I think on some level
it pisses you off that its become so
easy to actually help people

The clinical trial requires consent
which means locating the patients

AlS

POWELL
(feigning seriousness)
Is the pain associated with
intercourse itself with ejaculation
or with becoming aroused

PROT
It is associated with the entire
process I am aware these activities
result in pleasurable sensations for
you humans But for us the effect is
quite the opposite This applies for
both the males and females of our
species - and incidentally for most
other beings around the Galaxy

POWELL
Can you compare the effect to anything
I might be able to understand Like
a toothache or -

PROT
Its more like having your gonads
caught in a vice except we feel it
all over To make matters worse the
Sensation is associated with something
like your nausea accompanied by a
very bad smell The moment of climax
is like being kicked in the stomach
and falling into a pool of mot shit

Powell cant believe hes going along with this

Prot laughs

a pencil and a little RED NOTEBOOK

POWELL
Mot shit

PROT
A mot is a being much like your skunk
only far more potent

POWELL
If the experience is so terrible how
do you reproduce

Like your porcupines As carefully as

angstroms Ultra-violet

Powell looks at Chakraborty with some confusion He peers at
Chakraborty hoping for some kind of explanation from him
Chakraborty hesitates

CHAKRABORTY (CONTD)
Of course Prots explanation is
that due to his planets peculiar
quality of light caused by its two
suns KPAXians are used to light
conditions much like our twilight most
of the time

POWELL
What the hell are you saying Chak
I didnt think human beings could see
ultra-violet light

Powell utterly bewildered looks at Prots eye CHART in his

mushroom lights from boxes in hall

his other lamp does the same Then he closes his window

He exchanges a glance with Trexler leading Prot into his
office closing the door

She stands there a moment then fixes her sweater

INT POWELLS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Prot stands there surprised at first by the dark lighting in
the room Then with a wide pleasant sigh

As Powell observes him intently
Prot reaches up and slowly removes his GLASSES

PROT
This is much better A lot like home

Powell peers for the first time » at Prots EYES

They shine in the dim light very much human - yet - very much

like some nocturnal animal He plucks a papaya from the fruit

basket and takes a bite sitting down comfortably

As Powell remains staring Prot takes out his red notebook
PROT

I wonder if we might begin by my
asking you a question

POWELL
Please

PROT
Bess She does not speak Why is
that

Rev 010901 (Ivory) 32

Powell takes a moment interested by the question Interested
that Prot would ask it Prot tilts his head curiously as if
trying to understand Powell decides to stay with this
sensing he may be onto something

POWELL
You see on our planet sometimes
things happen to people and they just
shut down But enough about Bess

Prot sits there a moment He thinks about jotting something
down in his notebook But then just closes it tucks it away

Powell moves over to his window peeks out the blinds at the
snarl of traffic on Amsterdan Avenue people hustling here and
there He brings an eye back to Prot

POWELL
I wonder if you might tell me more
about your home

PROT
What would you like to know

POWELL
Well did you have a job on KPAX

PROT
(finding this funny)
No one has a job on KPAX Really
Mark is it that difficult to
understand On K-PAX if something
needs to be done you do it

POWELL
There must be jobs people dont want
to do Hard labor cleaning public
toilets I mean thats only human
nature

PROT
There are no humans on KPAX

be done that is really unpleasant

they are on Earth Mark We dont
have families as you know them
The idea of a family would be a non
sequitur on our planet - and most
others I might add

POWELL
(tries to see past the
smile)
Are you saying that as a child
you had no home to go to

PROT
Exactly now youve got it

POWELL
In other words you never knew your
parents

PROT
On KPAX children are not raised by
their biological parents but by
everyone They circulate among us
learning from one then another

POWELL
(pressing him)
What about brothers and sisters

PROT
No one on KPAX has more than one
child There is little reason to
since the average lifespan of a
K-PAXian is a thousand of your years

POWELL
Do you have a child

PROT
(quickly)
No

POWELL
Do you have a wife waiting for you
back on K-PAX

Prot releases a tedious breath as if not caring for the
direction of this conversation

Sensing Powell

PROT

listening We dont have Marriage on

KPAX - no husbands no wives no
families - get it To put it more
correctly the entire population is

structure then “Government

PROT
There is no need for one

POWELL
What about laws

PROT
No laws no lawyers

POWELL
Well then how does one know whats
right and wrong on K-PAX

PROT
(as if this were a stupid
question)
Every being knows whats right and
wrong

Rev 010901 (Ivory)

POWELL
But what if someone did do something
wrong Committed a murder Rape

PROT
Let me tell you something Marko
Most humans subscribe to the policy of
an eye for an eye a life for a
life Most of your religions are
famous for this formula known
throughout the Universe for its
stupidity Your Christ and your
Buddha had a different vision but
nobody paid any attention to them not
even the Christians and Buddhists
So no On K-PAX beings do not kill
other beings but if they did thered
be no punishment Apparantly this is
impossible for Earth beings to
understand but its the secret of
life believe me

POWELL
No crime brutality violence on K-PAX

PROT
You humans Sometimes its hard to
imagine how youve made it this far
Crime is less popular than sex even
Theres simply no need for it

Powell lost in thought watches over the grill As Rachel
comes up snaps her fingers in front of his face playfully
Then gives him a kiss

RACHEL
Where were you just now

Powell just gives her a frustrating smile and puts the corn
on a platter handing it to her

Powell knocks back his glass of wine leaves it by the grill
And follows her across the yard with a second platter heaped
with hot dogs and chicken -

almost tripping over SHASTA a golden retriever who is being
Chased under the back porch

Well I have a patient who seems to

know something about your field

marching across the grass toward them

POWELL
Excuse us for a moment Ernie

Ernie looks from Prot to Powell Then fearfully up at the
sky He scrambles backwards across the lawn up the veranda
steps and into the refuge of the hospital

While Powell views Prot with an aggravated breath

POWELL (CONTD)
Tts one thing to take an interest in
your fellow patients - its quite
another to make them think you can
cure then

Prot regards Powell baffled at his angry tone

familiarity

white-haired with a pipe - and two others DAVID PATEL and
STUART HESSLER They wear the intense eyes of men who have
spent their lives looking to the heavens

POWELL
Thank you gentlemen for doing this

INT HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - IN A FEW MINUTES

As Prot enters through the double doors with Navarro and
Chakraborty

We are in a HUGE DOMED ROOM Empty stadium seats all around
A formidable cameracomputer projector rises from the center
of the floor

Navarro amazed has never seen anything like this himself
He takes a seat by the doors with Chakraborty

Rev 11300 (Blue 46

Letting Prot walk slowly toward a semi-circular conference
table hooked up with two state-of-the-art FLAT-SCREEN MONT TORS
at which sit Steve Flynn Patel and Hessler

The men stare at Prot not really knowing what to expect

Powell quietly takes a seat by Chakraborty and Navarro He
catches Steves eye gives him a little nod

STEVE
Its a pleasure to meet you Prot
Wont you have a seat

Prot looks around takes the chair in the center of the room
by the projector facing them

STEVE (CONTD)
Im Doctor Becker This is
Dr Flynn Doctors Patel and Hessler

PROT
How many doctors are there are on this
planet

Steve laughs looks at his colleagues He likes this guy

Flynn motions to Steve who walks over to the Planetarium
console and presses a button The lights go dim And on the
DOME above them all is projected an astonishing SPLASH
OF STARS It fills our senses as if we are actually there

Chakraborty and Navarro lean back in their chairs Navarros
eyes now as wide as his mouth as he utters

NAVARRO
Shit

Powell looks from the stars to Prot

As Prot takes his glasses off gazing up - and around - at
the IMAGE with a wide breathless smile and a laugh
of both wonder and familiarity

STEVE
(smiles at Prot)
Feel at home

Flynn clears his throat trying as hard as he can to treat
Prot seriously

FLYNN
We have found your notes quite
interesting Prot

(MORE)

FLYNN (CONTD)
And wed like to ask you some
questions if thats all right

PROT
Be my guest

FLYNN
Good Then Il jump right in

PROT
Make sure you can swim

Flynn attempts an awkward little laugh looks at the others

By the doors Navarro amused repeats make sure you can
swim to Powell and Chakraborty in case they didnt get it

FLYNN
Yes well Lets start with this idea
of light travel shall we What can
you tell us about that

PROT
(smiles)
Nothing

The scientists give each other dubious glances

PROT (CONTD)
Tf I told you youd blow yourselves
up Or worse someone else Youd be
surprised how much energy there is in
a beam of light

They respond to this with tentative laughter Steve takes
over being friendly
STEVE
Well then I wonder if you could show
us how this light travel works

PROT
How about a demonstration

Powells expression becomes uncertain He catches a wary
Sidelong glance from Chakraborty

STEVE
(surprised)
That would be fine

PROT
Adios Aloha

He sits there with a wide grin

Rev 11800 (Pink) 48

Steve views him with uncertainty

STEVE
When are you going to

PROT
Im already back

The scientists cant help let out a couple of belly laughs
Steve regards Prot shrewdly

STEVE
Where I come from thats called the
fastest gun in the West routine

PROT
(imitates his Tennessee
drawl with equal candor)
Well I dont come from where you come
from Dr Becker

More laughter

Powell has to smile a bit sadly as he regards Prot seeing
what a farce this is becoming

When Flynn attempts to be serious again perusing Prots
notebook PAGES in front of him

FLYNN
Prot youve indicated in your -
notes that your planet K-PAX orbits
the twin stars Agape and Satori near
the constellation Lyra Frankly
were a bit mystified as to how you
gained knowledge of such a planetary
system around these stars

At the planetarium console Steve presses another button and
a huge INSERT OF A MAGNIFIED STAR SYSTEM APPEARS projected
against the dome of stars

FLYNN (CONTD)

This was taken from the Hubble We
computer enhanced it based on Doctor
Patels readings from telescopes in
Chile and Hawaii It is the clearest
picture we have of -

(checks himself regards

his colleagues)
where you come from What wed like
--- is if you could diagram on your
lightpad the orbital pattern your
planet takes around this system

Rev 11300 (Blue) 49

PROT
(delighted)
My pleasure

He gets up goes over to the lightpad picks up the stylus
there Unsure he looks back at the scientists They nod
Prot makes a mark on the lightpad over the projector He
looks up It appears as a scribble across the STAR SYSTEM
He shakes his head erases it then starts again animated
looking up to the stars with every mark he makes

The scientists lean back in their chairs with bafflingly
amused expressions

But as Prots scribbles take shape up ABOVE THEM their
expressions begin to change
For there projected over the STARS emerges a cogent

detailed DIAGRAM of what looks like a 4-PLANET SOLAR SYSTEM
around the two brightest stars Complete with a grid of
ANGLES and FORMULAS of relative distances

Prot looks up puts down the stylus satisfied

Flynn slowly takes the pipe out of his mouth

FLYNN
Steven could you input that

STEVE
Already on it

Steve has the Princeton Observatory database on line As
multiple STAR CHARTS and theoretical CHARTS appear on his

MONITOR he hurriedly inputs Prots information from the DOME

Powell looks from Prots diagram to the scientists confused

POWELL
What - whats going on

NAVARRO
(admiring Prots work)
Looks like the real thing to me

Flynn Patel and Hessler get up from their chairs to crowd
around Steves laptop

POWELL
Somebody want to tell me what the
hells going on

The scientists watch agog as the monitor displays an exact
replica of Prots solar system 38
Prot observes them with a knowing chuckle

PROT
I take it my calculations help explain
the perturbations youve been seeing
in the rotation pattern of your binary
star but have been previously unable
to explain

For a long beat the scientists just stare at Prot speechless

FLYNN
How how could you know this How
could you

PROT
Every K-PAXian knows this Doesnt
every school child on Earth know your
planet orbits your sun in an ellipse

Flynn and his colleagues look at each other stupidly

EXT HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - STREET - IN A SHORT WHILE 39
Prot sits waiting in the TAXI with Navarro and Chakraborty
Powell and Steve stand on the sidewalk

POWELL
What happened in there Steve I
mean - he could be a savant There
are savants who have painted flawless
copies of Rembrandts who couldnt even
remember their own names Steve you
dont believe this guy do you

Steve with a look toward the taxi confides to Powell

STEVE
I dont know what I believe Mark
But I know what I saw Tell you what
Im going to do Im going to
computer generate a star chart of the
night sky as seen from the position of
this planet K-PAX Ask your man to
draw one from memory Then send it to

Their faraway light fills his face He closes his eyes

Her eyes silent piercing

on the stone bench

POWELL

I had my weekly session with Sal
today He says youre taking him to
K-PAX

(lets Prot absorb this)
In fact Ive heard from most of the
patients on Ward Two They all tell
me theyre going to K-PAX I wonder
if thats a wise thing to be promising
patients in a psychiatric facility

Prot knits his brow with a problematic sigh

PROT
No no no I told them all very
Clearly I would only be able to take
one person with me when I return

Powell blinks not sure hes heard correctly

Trying to collect himself he helps himself to a strawberry

(to kids)
Watch this

Prot begins to talk to Shasta in remarkably accurate dog
whelps Even more remarkable Shasta starts howling back

PROT (CONTD)
She says she does not like it when you
hide her favorite shoe or sneak up on
her left side - because she can no
longer hear well in that ear
The kids stare at him in open-mouth disbelief

NATALIE
No way

Even Gabby the skeptic has to laugh in amazement

As Prot resumes talking to Shasta - Powell is puzzlingly
amused He catches Rachels eye she is not so sure

Dom watching Prot gives McAllister a look that says this
guy is the biggest wingnut Ive ever seen She cautions him
with a nudge

EXT BACKYARD DAY

The grill sizzles Everyone is seated around the PICNIC
TABLE As food is passed around Rachel places a giant FRUIT
SALAD on the table in front of Prot

RACHEL
Mark tells me you dont eat meat I
think thats very healthy

POWELL
Speak for yourself

RACHEL
So I made this fruit salad especially
for you

Prot just sits there admiring the beautiful fruit Then
looks at Rachel with such deep appreciation he does not know
what to say His reaction gets to her for a moment she
doesnt know why

RACHEL (CONTD)
Go on take as much as you like

Prot digs in taking spoonful after spoonful - after
spoonful Until there is a heaping mountain of it on his
plate

As EVERYONE stares The kids hold their hands over their
mouths to not laugh Prot glances up gives them all a smile

Everyone takes this as a cue to Start eating food is passed
around Dom putting ketchup on his burger pauses self-
consciously a moment as he watches Prot shovel in fruit salad

DOM
So what do they eat on KPAX
McAllister gives her husband a kick under the table

PROT
(mouth full)
Krees likras mainly But my
favorites are our grains drak thon
and adro - has a nutty flavor much
like your cashew

Rev 112000 (Buff)

DOM
(with an eye to
McAllister)
I see

Rachel gives Powell a poignant glance Shes never heard
anything so outlandish said so convincingly

EXT YARD AS THE MAGICAL SUMMER

Prot lemonade in hand walks across the yard a tail-wagging

Shasta at his side WE SEE things
now almost in moving snapshots

prickler from Gabbys bare foot

flower Dom giving McAllister

absorbs them all smiling at everyone as he wanders

through the open patio doors and

McAllister shoots Powell a look
then gives her a nod McAllister

INT POWELLS HOUSE - LATER

AND WE CUT TO

DAY MOVES ON

through his DARK GLASSES

» Abby pulling a

Mrs Trexler smelling a
a little smooch Prot
into the HOUSE
Powell considers a moment
follows Prot

Prot wanders into Powells den Finds FAMILY PHOTOGRAPHS

Prot smiles

RACHEL
No He doesnt live with us you

(beat)
Well the truth is he and Mark dont
talk to each other I dont know why
Im telling you this

PROT
Because Im a locked-up lunatic so
what could the harm be

RACHEL
(chuckling)
Maybe Maybe thats it

Ti

Then looks at the photo again and turns suddenly

reflective

PROT
Doctor Powell has been trying to teach
me this importance you humans place on
your biological connections

RACHEL
(ruefully)
Do you think he means it

PROT
You dont

RACHEL

Do you know what a family is You
worry They dont tell you that when
you decide to leave your single life
behindWhen theyre throwing the
rice and dancing the tarantellaThat
there is no biological connection
not the way you say it like its

something concrete like a rope or
a ligament Theres just this
desperate effort to hold on -- to hold

onto them And when you see someone
you love falling away -- falling --
and you cant hold on anymore

PROT
Then

Rev 112000 (Buff)

PROT
We dont have families on K-PAX
RACHEL
Then you dont know what youre
missing
PROT

What Or who
They exchange a look

RACHEL
Let me get you another lemonade

On Prot as he watches Rachel’ exit Then he notices a

TELESCOPE in the study Moves to it Considers it a moment

Then he bends down Lifts his sunglasses Squints through
the eyepiece As he does he lowers his scope Focusing on
something earthbound out the window

And we see that it is Powell at the far edge of the yard
that he has in his sights

CUT TO

EXT BACKYARD IN A MINUTE

As Prot walks over to Powell They stand there together under

the trees Powell takes a sip of beer Prot noisily slurps
his lemonade

POWELL
Fourth of July
(reminiscing)

I remember when Michael was a young
boy Id take him to the fairground
(another sip of beer as
the memory takes him

someplace)
Wed spend the evening eating
apple pie watching the fireworks

Prot turns his dark glasses to Powell

PROT
Thank you for inviting me here Mark

POWELL
Youre most welcome Prot

Just then Natalie runs up grabbing Prots hand

NATALIE
Push me on the swing

As she leads Prot off to the TREE SWING Powell watches
circumspectly as Prots fingers close so naturally and
tenderly around hers

Rachel comes out of the house also watching carefully

Prot picks Natalie up sits her down on the swing Making
sure her hands grip the ropes

PROT
Hold on tight now

He pushes her gently - playfully - a little higher now He
ducks under the swing - comes back up Making Natalie laugh
Her buoyant laughter bringing a big smile to his face

As Prot walks over to Powell They stand there together under
the trees Pow

64

ON POWELL as he watches struck by how familiar Prot is
with Natalie as if hes pushed a swing many times

Just then - Josh dashes out of the house in a bathing suit
and turns on the LAWN SPRINKLERS -

the water hissing up in jets around the swing -

The SOUND of it suddenly makes Prot stiffen He looks

around visibly shaken at the harmless spray of water The
hissing taking on an ominous quality

Powell regards Prot strangely noticing the change in him

Abby runs after Josh angrily grabbing his hand

ABBY
Why did you do that
Natalie slides off the swing gleefully

NATALTE
Lets run through the water

PROT
No wait

He grabs her arm

NATALIE
(frightened now)
Let go
RACHEL
NATALIE

Natalie breaks free runs for her mother

Around his DARK GLASSES Prots face fills with pain and dread
Watching Natalie run off

PROT
No dont go

He starts after her

RACHEL
MARK

POWELL
Prot

At the same time Powell runs for him Dom and Danny quickly
take their cues They rush Prot bringing him down But he
struggles like a wild animal His voice choked and
inarticulate as he keeps trying to reach for Natalie

74 64

Ddddddddd Nnnnnnnnnn
Gabby watches horrified as

Danny 180 pounds of varsity wrestler is flung off Leaving
Dom Powell and now Steve - straining to hold Prot down

DOM
God hes strong as an ox

POWELL
Betty quick

McAllister goes for her purse uncaps a syringe

Mrs Trexler helps Danny up viewing Prot with a mixture of
fear and pity - as the others try and keep him down

POWELL
Turn off the goddamn sprinklers

in the struggle Prots GLASSES get knocked off With a moan
he buries his face in his hands

Abby finally gets the sprinklers off Rachel clutches Natalie

Powell Dom and Steve stand up slowly carefully dripping
wet

Prot remains on his knees head to the ground His shoulders
shaking Shasta licks him whimpering

He gropes on the grass finding his glasses Puts them on
Then lifts his head a little disoriented He gets up

brushes himself off Bewildered by all the unnerved FACES
staring back at him Natalie now afraid hides behind Rachel

Prot just smiles sniffs the air -

PROT
is that apple pie I smell

He walks unsteadily towards the picnic table He sits
serves himself a slice of APPLE PIE Starts devouring it

Rachel comes up to Powell angrily
RACHEL
Happy I think you got through to
him dont you I think you made your
dent

She throws the towel at him she has just dried Natalie off
with and walks away

Rev 121100 (Grey) 75

Leaving Powell standing there He stares at Prot not
without excitement

INT VILLERS OFFICE - DAY
Powell paces in front of Villers at her desk

POWELL
-He was pushing my daughter on a
swing like hed done it a hundred
times before Not like some alien from
KPAX I saw him He was connecting
with something Some kind of normal
life

VILLERS
Thats not enough

POWELL
You cant transfer him to the fourth
floor Itll kill him Not now --
when Im actually making some progress
with him

VILLERS
This is a violent patient

POWELL
Hes not violent I think something
violent happened to him Prot wasnt
going after Natalie to harm her He
was trying to protect her

VILLERS
From the sprinklers
POWELL
I dont know from what
VILLERS
I need more to go on than a hunch
Otherwise--
POWELL

We need to regress him Take him back
into the past Find out what happened
and force him to confront it

VILLERS
Hypnotize him When did you last
conduct a hypnosis session Med
school Do you have any idea how
risky it is to regress a patient like
this one

Rev 121100 (Grey) 76

POWELL
Its his only chance

VILLERS
Push him too hard and he could wind up
switching to an alter or worse

POWELL
He has to be pushed Theres no
time He says hes going back to
K-PAX on July 27th Thats three
weeks away I think he could become
violent on that day - hurt himself or
someone else --— ‘

VILLERS
You know what the problem is Mark
Youre too close to this patient
Everyone can see it but you
(beat)
Im transferring him to the fourth
floor Thats final

Powell thinks a beat

POWELL

Then you help me do it
VILLERS

Me
POWELL

You were right What do I know
about hypnosis A six-hour course
when I was a resident You can do
this Youre the expert Theres
nobody better

VILLERS
Thats exactly why I wont do it
Ive seen what can happen

POWELL
Please Claudia
(beat)
Thats the whole point of seeing a
shrink isnt it -- that no matter

how crazy or screwed up your world is
at least youre not alone
(off her look)

I cant do it on my own -- Im too
close -- fine I admit it Doesnt he
deserve at least one person on his
side

Rev 121100 (Grey)

VILLERS
Mark why choose this one to save

He looks at her It takes him a moment to say this
POWELL
Because I feel like maybesomehow he
chose me
On Villers as she considers a beat

INT WARD 2 - MORNING

Powell stands in the doorway of PROTS EMPTY ROOM Navarro

and Simms stand there with hin

POWELL
What do you mean - hes gone

Navarro and Simms eye each other extremely embarrassed but

extremely stumped

NAVARRO
Hes just gone

Powell shakes his head unwilling to hear this He marches

over to a SECURITY MONITOR by the nurses station Navarro and

Simms following on his heels

A SECURITY GUARD is already rewinding the nights surveillance

video for them They all watch the MONITOR on it
appears walking down the hallway and into his room

NAVARRO
Thats around six-thirty after
dinner He goes in

Powell keeps his eyes glued to Prots door in the timestamped
video as it is fast-forwarded We SEE what Navarro relays

NAVARRO
He never comes out Seven oclock

POWELL
Wait wait what was that Go back

for the beams of several flashlights

broken Xerox machines and corroding file cabinets A young
SECURITY GUARD gives him a weary look

SECURITY GUARD
Weve checked every inch of this
hospital Doctor Powell Nobody ever
comes down here

A 2ND BEEFIER SECURITY GUARD down on his belly flashes his
beam into the last corner of the tunnel illuminating a brick
wall He looks back at Powell shaking his head

Powell looks at them both wipes a cobweb from his face

INT CONFERENCE ROOM EMERGENCY STAFF MEETING - LATE DAY

McAllister Chakraborty Fleen the rest of the gang seated
As Villers stares - incredulous at Powell who stands

VILLERS
Patients dont just escape from this
institution They dont just escape

POWELL

(knowing how bad it

sounds)
Theres no evidence of escape but
obviously Ive notified the police
social services Theyre taking it as
a low priority since he has no clear
record of being a public threat

VILLERS

(having heard enough)
Im going to have a great time
explaining this to the state board
We have psychotics up on Ward Four
packing their sneakers because they
think theyre all going to K-PAX
Find him Doctor Powell

Powell nods theres nothing hed like better

INT POWELLS OFFICE NIGHT
Bleary-eyed Powell sits at his desk on the phone

Rev 11300 (Blue)

POWELL

He hangs up looks through the doorway to his outer office -

where Mrs Trexler still sits

Curiously he gets up shirt rumpled tie loose He wal

windows of lists and information on her COMPUTER

Joyce its eleven oclock at night
and youre still here I know why Im
still here - but why are you still
here

She laughs as if this were a silly question eyeing her
CALENDAR which already says JULY 17

MRS TREXLER
Doctor Powell do you know how long it
takes to search a database like this

POWELL
That doesnt answer my question

DAY

She turns from his pointed gaze back to her computer Then

pauses to regard the PHOTO of her HUSBAND on her desk

MRS TREXLER

The other day when Prot came in
he asked me about Phil

(beat still hard for her)
IT said my husband was killed in
the line of duty ten years ago Prot
looked at me with that you know
alien curious look And asked me
why I still keep a picture of him

(a little quaver in her

voice)
I told him because it reminds me
of all the happiness we had together

fondly

MRS TREXLER (CONTD)
(beat smiles)
The next morning there were the most
beautiful carnations on my desk

She wipes a tear from her cheek looks up at Powell in
amazement

MRS TREXLER
Now how did Prot know those were my
favorite flowers

Powell looks at her not even knowing how to respond

INT POWELLS OFFICE - EARLY MORNING 70
Powell asleep his head on his desk A finger of SUNLIGHT
streams in across the desk kisses his face He squints
stirring wakes up Realizes hes been there all hight

He sits there a moment Then puts his hand into the beam of
sunlight a funny sensation coming over him

He gets up quickly follows the BEAM out his office - into
the HALLWAY To a window He peers out -

to the hospital grounds below Birds chirp in the early
morning sun dew is still on the grass And on the bench by
the fountain sits a solitary FIGURE

Powell can tell from the back that it is Prot

As Powell tie loose suit wrinkled hair disheveled races
across the grounds to Prot who hears him coming up behind

PROT
Doctor Powell I presume

POWELL

POWELL
Cut the crap Weve been searching
for you for three days
Prot regards Powell not a little put off by his attitude

Rev 012201 (2nd Pink)

PROT
I believe I mentioned my taking a trip
up north in one of our sessions Mark
You really should keep track

POWELL

Taking a trip

(looks around with a mad

laugh then back to Prot)
Youre a patient here You dont get
out of here without a discharge
Nobody does Nobody has nobody ever
will And dont dont give me that
beam of light shit Because I dont
buy it

POWELL
What would you say - if I were to tell
you that I dont believe you took any
trip to Iceland Greenland or any
place That I dont believe youre
from K-PAX That I believe you are as
human as I am

PROT
I would say you were in need of a
thorazine drip Doctor

Powell walked right into that one

POWELL
Then I appeal to your intelligence
Cant you at least admit the
possibility that I might be right

PROT
I will admit the possibility If you
will admit the possibility that I am
from K-PAX

POWELL
Well there is one way you could
convince me beyond any doubt Of
course Id need your consent

Powells eyes remain

Powell realizes at this moment just how much this “being
has gotten under his skin It is also at this moment
senses his opportunity

I do not see the point

ass every morning which may or may
not leave you with a stupid grin on
your face for the rest of your days
here on Earth Is that what youd

at the birds and the trees and the high brick wall

Powells voice becomes gentle earnest

You have Youve provided me with a
place to stay while I write my report
Youve fed me The fruit is

As the Sheriffs CAR comes up a dirt road to stop

at the RUINS of what was once an idyllic small farm Powell

climbs out of the car slowly Lets the Place seep into his
senses

The Sheriff comes around the car viewing the ruins solemnly

SHERIFF
Been empty Nobody comes anywhere
near here since all that happened
No living next of kin for the place to
go to anyway

He takes his hat off almost respectfully and walks up the
overgrown path Powell following him -

up stone steps into a HOUSE that is little more than pillars

in the open air

)

A loveseat taken over by weeds shards of dishes a mirror
clumps of what were once books toys is all that is left
to testify that a family once lived here

Powells eyes fall a moment on the broken hammers of what
was once a piano Sound board as the Sheriff begins

SHERIFF
Had detectives come from Albuquerque
try an piece this one together
Accordin to the official story
Porter was at work when this
drifter a Daryl Walker came by the
house Two-time Parolee lookin for
trouble Know what Im sayin’
Started out as a robbery “Wife and
daughter were out back 7

CLOSER ON POWELL he gazes out Past the hinges of what once
gas 2 back door He hears Prots VOICE Calling Becky
Sarah

AND HE FLASHES ON

PROTS FACE But it is now ROBERT PORTERS FACE A happy
tired humanity on it as he gets out of his truck overalls
Stained after a hard days work He waits for his daughter to
Tun out of the house and into his arms Waits

But he is met with an eerie silence Perplexed he heads up
the stone path - and into the HOUSE

SHERIFF (V0)
What we gather from forensics and
all was that this Walker - brought
both women back in the house at
gunpoint

FOLLOWING PORTER - his boots trudge up the Stairs face
growing worried at the Silence

PORTER
Becca Saree

His breathing becomes quicker panicked as he moves down the
narrow hallway sees a doll on the floor an overturned
watering can 1 he comes to the bedroom woe

AS WE COME BACK TO
POWELLS EYES wide shaken listening to the Sheriff

SHERIFF (V0)
Raped the wife Then shot them both

122 122

POWELL FLASHES ON

THE BEDROOM blood everywhere hands tied to bedposts
53° naked legs splayed bare feet dangling over the sides
of a bed

ON PORTER witnessing this eyes frozen He wears the look
of a man whose universe has in one instant shattered And
left him in the airless blackness of Space From deep within
him comes a choking sound

SHERIFF (V0)
Porter mustve come home found Walker
still here

Porter staggers back into the hallway - to see WALKER Who
scared takes out a gun Dazed but with an animal-like
reflex Porter knocks it out of his hand They struggle for
the gun like two grunting beasts until Porter with an
inhuman strength grabs Walkers wrists and pins him to the
wall Then raises his Other fist a Savage look coming
into his eyes A look built up over a lifetime of meekness

AND WE STAY ON PORTERS FACE - as with a final Savagery - he
sends the side of his fist into Walkers neck eee

SHERIFF (V0)
And then knocked the sonnbitch like
an Angus steer

BACK TO
POWELL as he closes his eyes
POWELL
God all mighty
SHERIFF
Snapped a grown mans neck like it was

a twig
(looks tightly at Powell)
Cant say I wouldn’tve done the same

The Sheriff puts his hat on walks out down the rubble of

back steps Powell follows him -

EXT PORTER HOUSE - OUT BACK - DAY 123
As the Sheriff continues on toward the trees Powell lingers

a Moment To view a withered vegetable garden He approaches

it astonished to see

the remains of a LAWN SPRINKLER somehow saved from fire It
sits there in the grip of weeds attached to a blackened hose

) 123 123

Along with the scorched handles of whats left of a childs
jump rope And as Powell stares at it wee

AN IMAGE FLASHES ACROSS HIS EYES

A beautiful young woman long black hair shining in the sun
and a little girl much like Natalie They jump rope
barefoot innocently happily in the Spray of water

THEN ANOTHER IMAGE

Dusk Robert Porter Staggering out of the house He kneels
down trying to wash the Blood off his hands in the sprinkler
sees the jumprope

As Powell blinks the images from his mind
A FINAL ONE COMES TO HIM

NIGHT Porter stands on the bank of a rushing RIVER He
Stares as if into nothing Overalls spattered with the dried
blood of both man and slaughtered cows With one hand he
rips off the straps lets the overalls fall off hin With the
other hand he tears the shirt off his chest Naked now
devoid of any human expression he drops into the water
letting it carry him away

) SHERIFF (V0)
We found his clothes here Probably
where he jumped in

124 EXT RIVER - DAY 124

Powell stares into the rushing white water He and the
Sheriff Standing carefully on the bank As the Sheriff
continues loudly above the sound of rapids

SHERIFF
This rivers Pretty treacherous even
in July Got a hell of a current

He looks downstream thoughtfully for a couple moments

SHERIFF

Still I spose it mightve been a
mistake officially to list it as a
drowning Since the body was never
found

(beat turns to Powell)
If that boy you got out there in New
York is really Robert Porter vee Id
just as soon not know about it You
know what I mean

INT ATRPLANE - EVENING 124A

The last glow of the western sun shines through a plane window
-- onto Powells scotch and peanuts

He sits there looking through a copy of the Sheriffs FILE
bearing the label Porter

There are grizzly photos of the crime scene drivers
license photo of Robert Porter mug shots of Walker
Glimpses of words from the report Forced entry 25 cm
gash thorax to abdomen blood semen the
deceased Sarah Porter Rebecca Porter

Beside Powell resting on his briefcase is also an old high
school YEARBOOK from Guadalupe High School 1985

Powell closes the file with sober reflection and looks out
his window at the first stars twinkling in the darkening

sky

EXT POWELL HOUSE « NIGHT A125

As a taxi stops in front And Powell steps out with nothing
but his briefcase The clothes on his back stick to him He
is bone-weary But the sight of his home fills him with
emotion

INT GIRLS BEDROOM - UPSTAIRS AB12

Powell stands there in the doorway Gazing upon his
DAUGHTERS Their angelic faces as they sleep

He also notices Prots star map the girls have tacked it
up on their wall It seems to fit right in with the twinkling
moon and star wallpaper

INT POWELLS HOME - IN A FEW MOMENTS B125
Powell steps quietly The house is in some disarray

HIGH SCHOOL YEARBOOK 1985 From Guadalupe County New
Mexico It sits on his desk He looks at it thinking hard

Then takes out a bottle of SCOTCH and two tumblers Places
them beside the yearbook He pours himself a tumbler Downs
it And just stands there preparing himself waiting

In a couple moments his door opens And Prot enters Powell
puts on a smile

POWELL

Prot eyes him carefully sitting

POWELL (CONTD)
All packed Ready to go

PROT
Quite ready I travel light
(beat smiles perplexedly)
Thats a joke You humans have no
sense of humor

Powell lets out a delayed I get it laugh Then pours both
glasses of Scotch Prot watches with uncertainty sensing
Powell has something up his sleeve

POWELL
I doubt Freud ever tried this But -
when someones going away we usually
like to send them off with a toast
Scotch okay Or would you care for
something more - fruity

Rev 012201 (2nd Pink)

PROT
(eyeing him)
I will try Scotch

Powell picks up both glasses leaving the yearbook there on
his desk He comes over hands Prot a glass Still unsure
Prot gets up takes it From him They stand there

POWELL
Well heres to a safe trip

Prot watches Powell drink Then after a moments hesitation

does the same Letting out a whistle

POWELL
To tell you the truth K-PAX does
sound like a beautiful Place

little more)
Id like to see it some day Think
theres a chance

You should see more of your world

Something you dont know yet

Powell waits eyes riveted on Prot
PROT
But we KPAXians have been around long
enough to have discovered

As Powells look turns unclearProt peers into his empty
Scotch glass with a solemn fatalism

PROT
The Universe will expand then
collapse back on itself —- then expand

again It will repeat this process
again and again forever What you
dont knowis thatwhen the
Universe expands again everything
will be as it was before Whatever
mistakes you make this time around

Prots expression grows more unsure as Powell opens the
envelope and takes out the Guadalupe High School Yearbook

He shows it to Prot

CLOSE ON PROT he stares at the Yearbook

Powell watches Prot intensely waiting for a reaction
We too are waiting for a reaction

An expression of immense sadness takes hold of Prot
followed by immediate calm

the police have come up empty its
as if she just disappeared

(looks cannily at Robert)
July twentyseventh You wouldnt
happen to want to tell me anything
about that would you Robert

Hes searching Porters expressionless EYES

POWELL
No

(with an earnest smile)
Well maybe itll come to you
Whenever youre ready Ill be
waiting

He gets up gives Porter a pat on the shoulders And takes
the handles of the wheelchair Pushing Porter on along the
path through the park

POWELL
Doctor patient Curious human
distinction

INT WARD 2 DAY

WE TAKE IN THE DAY ROOM As Maria gazes out a window And
Russell mumbles to himself Bible in hand And Sal and
Mrs Archer play a contentious game of fish

POWELL (VO)
By his own calculations he is due
again soon

WE MOVE ON into the ART ROOM Where Navarro setting a
new patient down at some watercolors pauses respectfully -
to look at PROTS GLASSES which rest on a pedestal like a
shrine facing the window

POWELL (CONTD VQ)
The patients in Ward Two have no
doubts whatsoever nor some of the
staff

AND WE LOOK OUT THROUGH THOSE DARK GLASSES into the
dancing sunlight

POWELL (V0O)
As for me well maybe Prot left
me Robert Porter

The SUNGLASS LENSES NOW FILLING THE SCREEN and the
pinpoints of sunlight playing like a thousand twinkling
stars

POWELL (V0)
And a couple of other tasks

(ALT) INT WARD 2 - ART ROOM — DAY

Powell walks slowly toward PROTS SUNGLASSES which rest
on a pedestal like a shrine with a Do Not Disturb Be Back
Soon” sign They face the window

Powell stares at them for a long beat

Then looking around seeing no one else is there he bends
down to LOOK THROUGH THEM

And as he does WE SEE THROUGH THEM into the dancing
sunlight the SUNGLASS LENSES NOW FILLING THE SCREEN
and the pinpoints of sunlight playing like a thousand
twinkling stars

INT GRAND STATION
AND WE ARE BACK with the OUT-OF-FOCUS CROWDS of Grand Central

Station the FIGURES resolve into PEOPLE rushing here and
there

And now CLOSE ON POWELL standing with his briefcase
searching for someone in the crowds

We hear Prot 0OS

PROT (V0)
Mark we KPAXians have been around
long enough to have discovered a
little something about the origins of
the Universe that you dont know yet
But Ill tell you

Powell moves his eyes over the nameless faces more intently
searching

PROT (VO CONTINUING)
The Universe will expand then
collapse back on itself -- then expand
again It will repeat this process
again and again forever What you
dont know is that when the
Universe expands again everything
will be as it was before Whatever
mistakes you make this time around
you will live through again Over and
over forever

A smile seizes Powell as hes found who hes searching for

PROT (VO CONTINUING)
So my advice to you is to get it
right this time around Because
this time is all you have

And WE SEE MICHAEL Coming out of a gate duffle bag over his
shoulder Pierced eyebrow He looks around unsurely Until
he spies his father He smiles tentative

They approach each other through the CROWDS Stand there
facing each other Powell initiates a hug halting at first
then warm gripping his son around the shoulders

And as the CAMERA PULLS BACK they walk off together
through a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT streaming down from one of the

high station windows and on to the Metro North
gates

OMITTED
FADE OUT
