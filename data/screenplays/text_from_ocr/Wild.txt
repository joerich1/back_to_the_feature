EXT PACIFIC CREST TRAIL - DAY

A breathtakingly beautiful and remote part of northern
California - luridly green forests forbidding mountains an
enormous sky No signs of civilization anywhere We can hear
the sound of human breathing though - her breath is ragged
maybe distressed

And now we see a hiking boot that clearly has something to do
with the breathing Its not on a foot - it’s perched on a
rock

The boot’s owner is CHERYL filthy possibly blonde hair her
face and legs covered in cuts and bruises On the ground
beside her is an enormous back-pack as big as she is
almost She’s trying to remove the other boot a process
that’s causing her immense pain

The boot comes off She throws it down beside the other one
Now all she needs to do is peel off the blood-stained sock
She tears the sock off in one fast agonizing movement She
winces and curses

Close on her exposed foot which is a raw pulpy mess One of
her toenails is loose She sings

CHERYL
Id rather be a hammer than a nail

takes a deep breath and suddenly rips the entire toenail
off

This causes a chain reaction She twists away in pain and
knocks the giant back-pack over The back-pack falls against
the boot and bounces it towards the edge of the path where
it topples down and deep into the woods below Cheryl stands
up and peers down in disbelief

CHERYL (CONT’D)
No

She sits back down and takes off her other boot This time
she gets the boot and the sock off in seconds She must feel
the pain but her anger and despair trump it

CHERYL (CONT’D)
FUCK YOU BITCH

She stands up and HURLS the one remaining boot down into the
woods towards its mate

As it falls a SUDDEN RUSH of disconnected images - a syringe
going into an ankle

EXT ROADSIDE - MOJAVE CALIFORNIA - DUSK

An old pickup pulls up outside a motel near Mojave The neon
sign - WHITES MOTEL - TELEVISION - VACANCY - is bright in
the twilight like a Hopper painting Cheryl gets out starts
to collect her stuff from the back of the pickup - her
enormous back-pack and two enormous plastic carrier bags
full of stuff She puts the bags down waves to the driver of
the pickup

INT MOTEL - DAY

Cheryl walks into the grubby lobby of the motel The TV up on
the wall behind the desk is showing the OJ trial The woman
behind the desk has her neck crooked uncomfortably so that
she can see it Cheryl comes in struggling with her bags

She dumps them on the lobby floor She’s excited The desk
clerk swivels round and glares at her

CHERYL
Hi I’d like a room for the night
please

DESK CLERK

Eighteen dollars

She looks over Cheryl’s shoulder out of the glass door
apparently checking something

DESK CLERK (CONT’D)
Unless you have a companion joining you
later If you have a companion it’s
more

CHERYL
I don’t have a companion

DESK CLERK
So it’s eighteen dollars For now

CHERYL
Its going to stay eighteen dollars

WILD Blue 3

DESK CLERK
Unless someone comes later

CHERYL
Someone wont

DESK CLERK
He might

Cheryl tries not to show impatience at the circularity of the
argument She pulls out a twenty and pushes it across the
desk The clerk takes the money and slides a form and a
ballpoint on a chain towards Cheryl

CHERYL
I’ve actually come here to hike the PCT
so I‘ll have to leave the license number
part blank No car

If Cheryl was hoping for some friendly and curious

engagement she’s getting nothing

CHERYL (CONTD)
And also I don’t have an address

DESK CLERK
So put down your folks’ address

Cheryl hesitates and then writes an address while the woman
goes back to watching the news report of the OJ trial

DESK CLERK (CONTD)
You think he did it I do That man is
guilty as sin

Cheryl picks up her bags and key in mouth heads towards her
xoom

INT MOTEL ROOM — NIGHT

Cheryl is lying on the bed in the motel room sipping cheap
wine from a plastic cup and watching TV with the sound down -
George Clooney is talking to a patient on ER Beside her bed
there is a bucket catching drips from some kind of plumbing
problem in the ceiling The plop of the drip seems ominous
She hasn’t unpacked her stuff which is still in carrier bags
on the floor She’s wearing a tank top and on her left
deltoid we see a tattoo of a blue horse It’s fresh and
ximmed with tiny scabs She begins to pick them off and one
starts to bleed slightly
WILD Blue 4

INT MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Cheryl parts the curtain of her room and looks out into the
dark Across the way there’s a man Cheryl’s age passably
attractive smoking a cigarette He sees her looking and she
allows her gaze to linger a little longer than she should
she drops the curtain She picks up the phone in the room
dials a number

CHERYL
(tenderly)
Hey

INT APARTMENT - NIGHT

PAUL Cheryls age handsome and likable is in his kitchen
cooking with a woman 20s both sipping wine We see Paul’s

(with equal feeling)
Oh Hey Hi

He tucks the phone under his chin and gestures to the girl
that hell be two minutes He wanders into his living room

PAUL (CONT’D)

CHERYL
Yeah I just gave your address as my
address on the motel registration form

Cheryl thinks about this for a moment

PAUL (CONT’D)
Happy trails

She hangs up The drip-catching bucket is filling up There’s
a little puddle of water around it She ignores it She
strips off to take a shower

( )
WILD Pink Ue

on the way to the bathroom she picks up the bucket and
realizes that it has a hole in it She snorts with bitter
amusement

CHERYL
Figures

INT BATHROOM - NIGHT

She dumps the water from the bucket into the bath and
catches sight of herself in a mirror She stares at herself
penetratingly Her reflection saddens her

Later She’s got wet hair and she’s wearing a T-shirt she
parts the curtains to see if the man’s still there Hes
gone She reaches for a small box ‘The Loudest Whistle In
The World’ it says on it She takes the whistle out and puts
it in her mouth It stays silent

INT MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Cheryl is standing in the middle of the motel room beside her
enormous backpack and looking around her helplessly

There is equipment on every available surface in the bedroom

She sighs takes her sleeping bag stuffs it into the
backpack Then her cooking pot then her tent then her
raincoat then her lantern and a towel toilet paper
notebooks

Later The backpack is a marvel to behold Everything has
been put away there are things dangling from every piece of
the framework and a complicated system of bungee cords This
efficiency has come at some personal cost though because
Cheryl is red-faced and sweaty

CHERYL
Oh shit

She has forgotten something She starts to delve in the bag

WILD Blue 8

INT MOTEL BATHROOM - MORNING 9

Cheryl is filling an apparently insatiable dromedary bag in
the bathroom sink The dromedary bag is basically a giant
water balloon heavy and hard to wrestle with when Cheryl
has filled it and sealed it she picks it up It’s clearly
heavy and slippery and it immediately squirms out of her
grasp and onto the floor She picks it up again and works out
a way to carry it as far as the bedroom

INT BEDROOM - MORNING 10

And now miraculously the dromedary bag is attached to the
backpack Cheryl is in an even worse state she’s sitting on
the floor next to the pack There are large damp patches
around her armpits She stands up looks to her handiwork
and then takes the backpack by the frame just to test how
heavy it feels The backpack doesn’t move She uses both
hands still nothing She can’t even lift it

CHERYL
Jesus Christ

She sits down in front of the pack puts her arms through the
shoulder straps She rocks backwards and forwards to gain
some momentum and then shoots herself forward If she was
hoping that the maneuver would end with her standing up
she’s disappointed now she’s on her hands and knees trying
to stop the pack from pushing her onto her belly

She crawls forward a couple of inches puts a hand on the
metal cooling unit in the room using this to give herself
some leverage

Slowly she manages to get to her feet her head rises her
knees straighten She’s basically in an Olympic weight
lifting stance and if the object of the exercise were to get
herself into a standing position wearing an enormous
backpack then she’s succeeded triumphantly

EXT GAS STATION - DAY vi

Cheryl is leaning against the wall beside a soda machine in a
gas station chugging a soda greedily Her backpack towers
above her head Shes already a hot and disheveled mess

Shes people-watching apparently trying to work out which of
the gas station’s customers she might approach for a lift
The mother with three squabbling children is easy to
discount so too the sinister-looking man with hooded eyes a
ponytail and a scar down one cheek

WILD Pink 9

She likes the look of a pair of men who may well be father
and son - the father is fiftyish the son is 16 - in a van
As the father is about to open the van door Cheryl
approaches him unsteadily

CHERYL
Hi You driving west
MAN
(reluctantly)
Yeah
CHERYL -

I’m going to Tehachapi Pass
The man shrugs

MAN
OK

Cheryl walks over to the car and then realizes that she has
no easy way of climbing into the back seat She opens the car
door sits on the edge of the seat with her legs on the

ground lies down and wriggles out of the backpack

INT VAN - DAY 12

Cheryl happy in the back seat of the van without her pack
on

MAN
So what’s going on at Tehachapi Pass

CHERYL
I’m hiking the PCT from there

is still you know quite a stretch for
me

MAN
So were going to be your last human
company for a while

CHERYL
I guess that’s right I should make the
most of the conversational opportunities

They almost immediately lapse into a silence broken by the
man who turns the car radio on and searches for music The
Shangri-Las’ “I Can Never Go Home Anymore” suddenly plays
The son seems annoyed by his father’s music selection Cheryl
looks out the window at the arid landscape and smiles

INT BOBBI‘S HOUSE DAY Al2

BOBBI Cheryls mother - thirtyish attractive bright-eyed
arty hippy energetic - is dancing to the Shangri-Las tune
with seven-year-old Cheryl Their house is comfortable
cheaply but imaginatively furnished full of colour Cheryl
and Bobbi have a whole choreographed routine to accompany the
Shangri-Las’ song which they perform with perfect seriousness
while doing the dishes The girls stop dancing when Cheryls
four-year-old brother LEIF turns the music off

INT VAN - DAY B12

The son just switched the radio off and goes back to his
reading His father looks at him

THE MAN
I love you too son

The father shakes his head visibly hurt No signs of
compassion from the son who keeps on reading

Cheryl goes back to her daydreaming
SOUNDLESS FLASHBACK cl2

Were back at Bobbi‘s house Bobbi holds her hands a couple
of inches apart Young Cheryl and Leif start to smile and
shake their heads no Bobbi moves her hands further apart
The kids shake their heads again Bobbi’s arms are stretched
as wide as they can go This is the children’s cue for a hug
They run into her arms

canes

WILD Blue 11

Even though we don’t really understand whats going on (we
will later) this demonstration of love and happiness would
put a smile on anyone’s face

but not on Cheryl’s as she keeps looking out the window
EXT ROADSIDE - DAY 13

The van pulls off the road and Cheryl gets out The man opens
the door and walks round to help her With enormous effort
Cheryl drags the backpack down the seat The man takes over
picks it up drops it down with an alarming thump He’s
clearly taken aback by the weight

MAN
Youre going to put that on your back
Because I couldn’t put it on mine

CHERYL
Oh you get used to it

The man stands there for a moment waiting for her to put it
on He wants to see that she can

Cheryl smiles at him not willing to do it in front of him
There’s a standoff for a moment

CHERYL (CONT’D)
Thanks for the ride

The man stares at her for a moment longer realizes that
she’s waiting until he’s gone and gives up

MAN
Be safe out there

CHERYL
I will

He gets back in the van and drives off Cheryl sits down in
the dirt and adopts the position she needs to get the pack on
her back

She looks around her Shes on the edge of the desert Dust
is blowing around her feet she’s surrounded by the mountains
of the Sierra Nevada It’s already hot She sees a fence-post
a few yards away and walks towards it

There‘s a small metal sign that says PACIFIC CREST TRAIL
underneath the sign is a small metal box She opens it and
takes out the notebook and pen inside This is the trail
register She writes in the book What she has written
appears on the screen in her handwriting

CARD ON SCREEN DAY 1
EXT PACIFIC CREST TRAIL - DAY 14

Close on Cheryls face She’s sweating and breathing hard
The confidence and excitement is fading out The breathing
forms only one part of a complicated rhythm track which
involves her footsteps the creaking of the pack and the
sloshing of the water container She grimaces with pain and
attempts to adjust her pack She’s trying not to collapse
under its weightas we see the fence-post with the trail
register maybe a hundred yards behind her

EXT TRAIL - DAY 15

Later The same sort of terrain - a rocky occasionally steep
trail scrubby dry bushes The fence-post is still visible
only a little further away Sweat is stinging her eyes and
blurring her vision The pack is agony

CHERYL (VO)
What the fuck have I done What the fuck

What we hear is Cheryl’s MIX-TAPE RADIO It’s the sound of
her head a jumble of oaths and songs and poems and adverts
and occasionally cogent thought and we have access to it
throughout the movie

CHERYL (V0)

This cri de coeur becomes another instrument to add to the
cacophony of her walking rhythm

EXT TRAIL — DAY 16

Cheryl stops walking out of breath and turns around We can
still see the fence-post - only just but it’s there she
shakes her head turns again and keeps walking

She makes an effort to take her backpack off but stops Too
painful She rests her pack against a large rock unbuckles
it and reaches over to a sage bush She picks a handful of
the leaves rubs them between her palms and puts her face in
them inhaling deeply She looks at the blue sky breathes

EXT TRAIL - DAY 18

Cheryl puts her backpack down and rests on all fours
exhausted and shaken She rummages around in her pack and
pulls out a chair her tent the stove and a couple of books -
her guide and her copy of Adrienne Rich’s Dream Of A Common
Language We watch as Cheryl struggles to erect or even
understand her tent even though it’s nowhere near sunset

Later Finally the tent is up her camping seat is
positioned at the entrance Cheryl is on her knees examining
the stove She sighs at the effort involved in lighting it

and pulls from her pack some tuna jerky and a small packet of
nuts She sits wearily down on the seat and looks at her pack
that stands against a Joshua tree It’s enormous She looks

around shakes her head and begins to write in a small book

CHERYL (V0)

energy remembering why I thought I could

read out loud by a lecturer - wild grey hair alternative an
old-school feminist

LECTURER

“thinking about” actually means writing
in essay form

Chuckles and groans from the students

Is where did this poem come from
Simple as that So all you need to do is
go away and find out about Adrienne
Rich’s life and the history of American
poetry and youre all set

More chuckles and groans

The usual walking rhythm - slosh creak thump There is
something else that’s making her uncomfortable however on
top of the pain in her shoulders and hips and feet she’s in
a cold sweat She stops takes off her pack rummages inside
and pulls out a small trowel and some toilet paper She walks
off the trail a few yards squats down and tries to dig in
the dirt with the trowel Nothing doing - she can’t penetrate
the dry rocky surface She’s getting desperate - she starts
trying to use the trowel as a pickaxe Still nothing She
hurls the trowel down on the ground in disgust fumbles with
her trousers takes them off kicks them well away and
squats Her face registers relief Afterwards she collects
stones and places them on and around her own excrement

Later Cheryl clears her throat and starts talking to
herself

CHERYL
“So CherylWhat do you do for fun
When youre not hiking” “Oh I like to
sit on a real toilet with a seat and a
flush And I like to cook Like food I
like to cook food and eat it I love

It’s even hotter if anything and Cheryl is scarcely
recognizable as the woman we saw talking to Paul in the hotel
room She’s a different colour from the sun and the dirt and
the blood and she’s already thinner She’s sitting on the
side of the trail boots off pulling all the available cold
food she has the nuts and the power bars and the jerky and
laying it out in a line There isn’t much of it she unwraps
a power bar swallows it in two bites chases it down with
some warm water She’s still starving She unwraps another
one It makes no difference

distance She sniffs the air in the truck and then sniffs
her clothes and her armpits - what she can smell is herself
She winds the window down When she knows Frank can’t see
she opens the glover compartment and finds a silver whiskey
flask she screws it open takes a sip She reaches under the
drivers seat and finds a black case Inside a gun

LATER - NIGHT A34
Frank gets into the truck
FRANK
Ive been thinking You can come home
with me Dinner and a shower
Cheryl is alarmed but is trying to stay calm

FRANK (CONTD)

CHERYL

She laughs trying to give the impression of being at ease

FRANK (CONTD)

He leans across Cheryl opens the glove compartment takes
out the flask and hands it to her

FRANK (CONTD)
Ladies first

Cheryl takes a sip from the flask

FRANK (CONTD)
Im going to call you Jane

He starts to drive

CHERYL
I’m not out here on my own actually My
husband Paul is a little further ahead on
the trail But were meeting up soon At
Kennedy Meadows probably

Frank takes the flask from her takes a long sip

FRANK
There’s something else I like to do when
I finish work

He looks at Cheryl He’s impossible to read As he’s driving
with one hand on the wheel Frank reaches beneath his seat
where the gun is Cheryl grips the door handle preparing to
open it and jump out Frank comes up with a clear bag pulls
out a thick lasso of red licorice holds it out to Cheryl

FRANK (CONTD)
You want some Miss Jane

Cheryl takes it gratefully and crams it into her mouth
FRANK (CONTD)

My wife hates it that I eat candy before
dinner

WILD Blue 23 A34

He peels off a chunk of licorice puts it in his mouth and
Cheryl settles back into her seat

LATER A35

Through the windshield we’re approaching a house in the
middle of nowhere Literally Nothing to reassure Cheryl

INT FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT 35

Frank and his wife live in a small spotlessly clean three-
room house The TV is blaring away - more news of the OJ
trial in front of two empty chairs that clearly belong to
heavy people Franks wife Annette a large woman appears
from the kitchen and places large quantities of food ribs
greens and corn on the table Cheryl cant take her eyes off
it She moves towards a chair so that she can dig in

ANNETTE
Hold on sweetheart No offence but

She picks up the newspaper from the table removes a couple
of pages puts them over Cheryl’s chair Cheryl looks
mortified

Later Frank and his wife have finished eating but Cheryl is
still going Her plate is full of rib bones

FRANK
You meet your husband at college

She remembers what she told him in the truck

CHERYL
Oh Paul Yeah

FRANK
He must be even crazier than you One
thing going on a hike like that when
youre aman Another thing letting your
wife do it

ANNETTE
Not everyone in the world thinks like
you Frank

FRANK
No and it’s why the world is all messed
up

CHERYL

Paul and I kind of do our own thing

INT SHOWER - NIGHT 36

Cheryl in the shower At her raw blistered bruised feet
the water is running almost black The hot water on her body
is as intense an experience as the food was until she
touches her tattoo

INT TATTOO PARLOUR - DAY 37

Close on the blue horse being created by a tattooist - except
as the camera pulls back it’s clear that the shoulder
providing the canvas belongs to a man - Paul Cheryl is
watching She’s revolving her shoulder gently The tattooist
is a woman tattoos everywhere neck arms hands Paul
winces

TATTOOIST
So what does this horse mean to you guys

PAUL
Well we both really dig horses

CHERYL

Were actually getting divorced This
afternoon So we wanted something that I
dont know Bound us together forever

She’s emotional although the tattooist doesn’t notice

TATTOOIST
It hasnt occurred to you that it might
be less painful to stay married Cheaper
too

Paul smiles and sees an opportunity to get the conversation
off their relationship

PAUL
Well at least we probably wont regret
it Couples don’t necessarily stay
married but they tend to stay divorced

The tattooist smiles
PAUL (CONT’D)

You get a lot of people asking about
removing tattoos

WILD Pink Ly

TATTOOIST

PAUL
It’s quite a big slate

CHERYL
I cheated on him many times and I don’t
know if I can stop And I hate hurting
him He deserves so much better

The tattooist carries on with the job in silence
437 INT PAUL AND CHERYL’S APARTMENT - DAY A37

Close on a hand made book on which it’s written The Day The
Daisies Bloomed Next to it a dictionary

That is Cheryl’s POV as she sits on the sofa reading
something that makes her smile and look at Paul who is
gathering all the legal papers spread on the table

PAUL
Anyone who gives their marriage vows a
title like that is by definition too
young to get married

Cheryl goes back to her reading and stops choked by an
emotion

Paul notices and looks at her with compassion

CHERYL
(avoiding Paul’s look)
I hope you can do that someday with
someone else

PAUL
I hope you can too

EXT CITY STREET - DAY 38

Paul and Cheryl are hurrying along the street arm-in-arm
They reach their destination a downtown office building and
Paul opens the door Cheryl stops him from going inside

CHERYL

Paul rolls his eyes affectionately

CHERYL (CONT’D)

INT OFFICE - DAY 39

The notary public VAL is very small mid-thirties with
cropped hair dyed bright blonde apart from a streak of pink
She has tattoos too She’s a punk notary She’s examining the
divorce papers while Paul and Cheryl watch We can see that
theyre holding hands

VAL
Is that right ‘stry-ed’

CHERYL
Its just Strayed’ Like a stray dog

She looks at Paul He smiles No comment

CHERYL (CONTD)
I needed a new name and I saw that word
in a book and you know all the
meanings I looked it up “To wander from
the proper path to be lost to be
without a mother and a father to become
wild”

Val isn’t interested

VAL
OK This all looks fine

CHERYL
I just want to say that this isn’t a
regular divorce

CHERYL (CONTD)
This is not for lack of love just so you
know I love him and he loves me

Val nods but she doesn’t want to know about this She may
have dyed blonde hair and tattoos but she’s a notary not a
therapist She presses her notary public stamp against some

pages
CHERYL (CONTD)
This was all me He didn’t do anything

I’m the one I broke my own heart

Paul lets go of Cheryl’s hand
Cheryls eyes fill with tears

PAUL
Cheryl please

She stops talking Val decides to study the papers one last
time as a way of avoiding eye-contact She puts them in an
envelope and thrusts them across the table towards Cheryl
VAL

You’re all set You have to mail them

yourselves Good luck
Cheryl won’t take them Paul does
EXT STREET DAY 40
Paul and Cheryl standing by a mailbox Paul is holding the
envelope that Val gave him Without saying anything he posts
the envelope through the slot It seems brutal given the
atmosphere of indecision and love

PAUL
What are we doing

CHERYL
Saying goodbye

Paul nods He knows

CHERYL (CONTD)
Will you come back for a drink

He kisses her on the cheek and walks away

Cheryl finishing her shower - just letting the water wash
over her still She finishes the shower and gets out She
starts to dry herself winces She looks at herself in the
bathroom mirror puts her arms out straight on either side of

FRANK

Cheryl laughs - at his frankness and his lack of
encouragement

FRANK (CONTD)
But don’t listen to me I’ve quit a bunch
of things Jobs A marriage I’d have
quit your hike pretty much on the first
day

CHERYL
And do you regret any of them

Frank thinks
FRANK
I never had the choice I just couldn’t
do them Wasn’t never a time when it felt
like there was a fork in the road
Cheryl thinks about this

CHERYL
Yeah that’s about the size of it

44 EXT TRAIL - DAY 44
Cheryl rejoins the trail It’s a rocky hot steep section
with mountains everywhere near and far Cheryl signs the
trail register Handwriting on the screen

46 EXT TRAIL - DAY 46
CARD ON SCREEN - DAY 11

The old familiar nightmarish rhythm the sloshing of the
bag the creak of the pack the pounding of the feet The
trail is steep at this point

Shes so focused on her rhythm that she fails to hear a new
instrument in the mix As well as the creak and the plod and
the slosh there’s a rattle She ignores it for a few seconds
then realizes what it is and stops dead At her feet there is
a huge rattlesnake

She scrambles backwards and stands stock-still staring at
it Shes petrified Her breathing is heavy and fast - she
tries to slow it and regain self-control

CHERYL
Listen I just want to scoot right by
you there

She makes a slithering gesture with her hand
CHERYL (CONTD)
OK Ill get onwith my day you get on
with yours

The snake stays put She gets ready to move then changes her
mind

Cut to later Cheryl and the rattlesnake are ee
positions

And later Cheryl is a little further back sipping water
from a bottle

And later Cheryl preparing to move again This time she
moves She takes as wide a berth as she can and then runs as
fast as she can given the weight of the pack with the
occasional glance back

Oh you know Weekend hikes a few
lectures I heard Ray Jardine speak a

Close on Cheryl’s face She’s trying to look as though she’s
done all this while at the same time keeping the panic out
of her face

The store sells all kinds of equipment for outdoor
activities Cheryl gets distracted by a display of books She
picks one up flicks through it and reads a page not paying
attention to Aimee

AIMEE

Youre doing it in front of me And if
youre pregnant were going to pay a
visit to your “idea” and we’re going to
make a plan

It’s their turn to pay Cheryl puts the book back in its
place THE PACIFIC CREST TRAIL VOLUME ONE with the
photograph of a spectacular landscape on its cover a lake
surrounded by rocky mountains and blue sky

INT LADIES’ TOILET - DRUG STORE A51

There are two stalls Only one is occupied By Cheryl But we
only see her boots and winter jacket on the floor as we hear
her pee It stops This is Aimee’s POV as she stands in the
toilet waiting for her friend to come out

INT ALLEY - DRUG STORE B51

Were on an alley full of drugs and medications It looks
endless Suddenly there is a little girl seen from behind
that walks in and away from us with a small bottle in her
hand That is Little Cheryl-7 She’s holding back tears

EXT PARKING LOT - DAY 52

Cheryl is shovelling the snow away from her car under the
surveillance of Aimee who looks at her with red and teary
eyes Aimee would like to take over but Cheryl refuses and
keeps on shovelling her mind spinning and we can hear it
It sounds like an engine blended with the repetitive noise of
wipers going up and down a windshield

Later Cheryl keeps on shovelling with the same
determination Aimee is now crying

Cheryl suddenly stops shovelling breathless There is
something different in her eye And we see what she sees

AS52

WILD Blue 36
Ps

That photograph of the lake again surrounded by giant
mountains and as we get closer and closer to it we see
little Cheryl-7 among the nature

Back on Cheryl who turns to look at Aimee It starts to snow

until her voice brings us back to reality

an abortion

INT CHERYL’S CAR - PARKING LOT - DAY AS2

about half the size of Cheryl’s And he has a trekking pole
which he uses with a kind of nerdy enthusiasm

GREG
Pretty big pack youve got there Ray

about that

Later A rockfall has slowed Cheryls progress She can’t go
round it there’s a sheer rock face on one side a steep drop
into scrub on the other She has to clamber over it She
chooses the easiest point and attempts to climb but the pack
makes it impossible for her She removes the pack and with
great effort manages to place it on the rocks in such a way
that she has a shot at retrieving it from the other side

She climbs over the rock and turns around to begin the task
of lifting the pack over to her side She climbs back over
the other side puts the pack back on and starts to wobble
back over the rock When shed done it she allows herself the
‘luxury’ of squatting on all fours There’s a little grin of
triumph

triumphant

Kennedy Meadows is a pleasant welcoming campsite with a
caferestaurant and a general store There’s a big banner
saying WELCOME TO KENNEDY MEADOWS hanging from one of the

Ed an older man stout and bearded beams at her amiably
Cheryl looks bewildered by the kindness of strangers

CLOSE-UP of four bottles of Snapple lined up on the table We
see Cheryl’s face distorted and coloured by the drink but
still clearly full of longing through the glass

CHERYL
Oh my God

She picks one of the bottles up and drains it while the men
cheer as if this were some kind of keg party In any other
context youd worry for her - a young blonde woman a group
of men drinking beer But it’s Snapple and it’s Kennedy
Meadows and these people are hikers and it’s all benign
Cheryl drains the second bottle too

Cheryl pokes her bare bloody bruised feet in the air

CHERYL
Do I look like someone who needs help

ED
OK so first of all your boots are too
small That’s why you’re losing toenails

was supposed to hurt that bad But I have
nothing else And no money

off mountains either If you’re worried
about cheating yourself make your hike

sound of that

CHERYL
Ive had a whole ton of different jobs

personal But I’ve noticed it’s often
personal trauma that forces people out of
their lives and into the hobo life

CHERYL
I’m still in my real life OK I’ve just
taken some time out There is no hobo

Jimmy Carter looks at her disbelievingly and then shrugs -
he’s not going to argue He reaches through the open window
of his car door and pulls out a camera

He doesn’t wait for permission We freeze momentarily on
Cheryl’s face and gesture - she looks like a hobo

Dearest Cheryl Welcome to Old Station I

more Six hundred miles Damn I hope you
didnt mind all the stuff I got into in
the last letter Once I’d put it in the
mail-box I wondered whether I’d done the
xight thing Maybe the truth is better to
speak than to hear Maybe you didn’t want
to know any of that But I was angry with
you

Cheryl puts the letter in her bag and starts to leave

MAN BEHIND COUNTER

A pause while Cheryl works out how much she wants to say to
this woman

CHERYL (CONTD)
My mom died of cancer four years ago and
my dads a bastard He hasn’t been in my
life since I was six which is probably
for the best because he was a violent
man Oh and I got divorced a few months
ago So my lifes kind of emptied out

Stacey nods

STACEY
Join the club

Cheryl smiles at her

CHERYL
I have a brother Leif I love him like
mad but we lost each other

(a beat)

How about you
Stacey hesitates to talk

STACEY
I can’t stay married I’ve been married
and divorced three times

Stacey shakes her head not proud of her accomplishment but
keeps her smile on her face

STACEY (CONTD)
I need to find something in me I don’t
know what yet but I needed to re-
gather I guess the trails a good place
for that For people whose lives have
emptied out I mean look

(gesturing to the sunset)
This has the power to fill you up again
if you let it Im slowly learning to

Cheryl laughs Stacey wonders why

CHERYL

me nuts “Every day theres a sunrise and
a sunset and you can choose to be there
for it You can put yourself in the way
of beauty”

Cheryl shrugs and stares at the poster behind him - a picture
of the universe with an arrow pointing at a tiny dot and the
words “YOU ARE HERE’ beside it

CHERYL
I see that poster all over the place I
hate it Who wants to teach kids that
they don’t matter

Vince turns around to look at it

Did you feel as though you mattered

This gets to her momentarily

Yes I know I did

Cheryl sees what she’s been looking for - a stagnant pond
the size of a tennis court The water is shallow and brown
and youd have to be desperate to think about drinking it

She pulls out her water purifier crouches down and begins to
pump the brown liquid into the bottle

CHERYL (V0)
Do not let the tube touch the bottom Do
not let the tube touch the bottom

The pumping is hard and even when she has filled a bottle
it doesn’t look anything less than poisonous She finds her

Fuck you iodine tablets

Clint takes a beer can and starts to leave TJ follows and
waves Cheryl goodbye with the other beer can in his hand She
waves back and watches them in a fake posture of readying
herself to leave as they disappear into the woods She stays
still and listens but her breathing prevents her from
hearing properly She holds her breath The sound of
footsteps slowly fades out She starts to breathe again

Ashland is completely bewildering for someone whos spent so
much time alone in the wild It’s bathed today at least in
dazzling sunlight and there are punks and hippies and
tattoos everywhere Cheryl doesn’t look out of place with
her tattoo and her caked-on dirt and her back-pack but she
feels out of place She sees Jerry Garcia’s face and name
everywhere - on home-made signs in shop windows on T-shirts
stuck onto the sides of vans She smiles and nods her head to
the rhythm of an acoustic guitarist playing the Grateful
Deads “Box of Rain” on the sidewalk accompanied by a male
singer

Cheryl stops next to a young girl pink hair and studs to
listen

There’s no box And before you ask no I
can’t advance you the money This is a

Cheryl starts to say something stops herself turns away
from the woman and starts to walk away reading her postcard

EXT MAIN STREET - DAY 144

Cheryl is looking wide-eyed at the abundance in the shop
windows Outside a food store there’s a bucket of peaches
Cheryl picks up a peach and puts it to her nose inhaling
deeply She puts it back She spots a drugstore with a
cosmetics ad in the window - a glamorous woman lipstick and
eye make-up Cheryl stares at her and goes in

INT DRUGSTORE - DAY 145
Cheryl is trying on lipstick She looks at herself in the
mirror The plum-coloured lipstick looks incongruous on her
garish A middle-aged immaculately turned out saleswoman
standing nearby spots her

SALESWOMAN
That shade looks nice on you

CHERYL
Really I don’t look weird Like a clown

SALESWOMAN
No

The saleswoman approaches her for a closer look and then
stops

SALESWOMAN (CONT’D)
Oh my

Cheryl looks at her puzzled

SALESWOMAN (CONTD)
Do you mind if I say something The
nicest lipstick in the world cant help a
girl if she doesn’t take care of her
personal hygiene

Cheryl laughs embarrassed

CHERYL
Oh I’m sorry I intend to take care of
that

SALESWOMAN
(whispers)

It really needs to be a priority

sweetie

EXT STREET - DAY 146

Cheryl comes out of the store holding a Snapple She looks at
it with longing and then starts to glug it down She stops
halfway through savoring it Her attention is taken by a
very cute guy slightly older than Cheryl across the street
He’s handing out flyers He spots Cheryl smiles at her
crosses the road This is JONATHAN

JONATHAN
Hey

Hes very handsome indeed and Cheryl is obviously attracted
to him

CHERYL
Hello

JONATHAN
I work at a music club down the street
and were honoring Jerry Garcia tonight
Why don’t you come along

He hands her the flyer Cheryl makes sure she stands at arms
length

JONATHAN (CONT’D)
Whats your name

CHERYL

WILD Blue 89
146

Every time Jonathan tries to get a bit nearer Cheryl
retreats a yard

JONATHAN
(Laughing)
I don’t bite

CHERYL
I don’t mind some biting

The moment she’s said it she regrets it

CHERYL (CONTD)
Oh my God Im so sorry I’ve been on my
own for a long time

She regrets this too

CHERYL (CONTD)

I don’t meanI’ve had a ton of
relationships so I’m not like some old
maid butAAARGH

Cheryl shoots herself in the head with her fingers

JONATHAN

Look I1l put you on the guest list And
maybe we can do something afterwards
What do you think

CHERYL

I’d like to But it depends on some
things beyond my control Really stupid
crap about money and soap andfresh
underwear

Jonathan puts his hands in the air a gesture intended to
convey that he doesn’t want to know any more

JONATHAN
I hope to see you later

Cheryl watches him go drains her Snapple and marches off
with a new determination

INT POST OFFICE - DAY 147
Cheryl is back at the counter in the post office and the

same crabby woman is serving her The clerk doesn’t appear to
have any recollection of their previous meeting

CHERYL
(the merest trace of
impatience)

S-T-R-A-Y-E-D
This rings some kind of bell with the crabby woman

WOMAN

that name on

She disappears to look Meanwhile Cheryl watches the kids in
the post office again One young couple in the next line are
kissing passionately Cheryl smiles involuntarily suddenly
the crabby old woman is back - this time with a large box

WOMAN (CONTD)
There you go Sign here please

She pushes a form across the counter Cheryl looks at her in
disbelief

CHERYL
Do you have any idea how important your
job is Seriously The lives of all the
people in this room are in your hands We
need you to be kind and we need you to
care

WOMAN
Happy to help Next please

INT MOTEL ROOM — DAY 148

Close on what could be a map a ridged pale puckered
otherworldly landscape It’s the skin on Cheryl’s hips where
the skin has been rubbed raw and healed itself ‘and rubbed
raw and healed itself until it resembles something that you
might find in an organic butcher’s shop Cheryl is wearing a
black bra and pants and she’s examining herself thoughtfully
in the motel-room mirror Shes a different woman from the
beginning of the movie tanned slender muscular sun-
bleached beaten up hairy She shaves her legs

Later She’s fully dressed and wearing a fresh T-shirt She
checks herself one more time

WILD Yellow 91
148

She shrugs - it’s the best she can do - and leaves the room
for her date CLOSE on the detritus on the bedside table
some change a half-eaten bag of potato chips a Snapple
bottle - and the condom that she’s been carrying in her
pocket for hundreds of miles

INT DRUGSTORE - EVENING 149
Cheryl is back at the beauty aisle in the Co-op she visited

earlier on in the day The same woman is still there still
waiting for customers

CHERYL
I had a shower
SALESWOMAN
Great
CHERYL

And I think I have a date But I don’t
have any money so I’m just going to help
myself to any free samples you have

SALESWOMAN
OK Lets see what weve got

INT CLUB - DUSK 150

Cheryl is wearing make-up She looks good but unfamiliar to
us The club is full Some of the people from the post office
and the plaza are among the crowd listening to an original
cover of “Ripple” by the Grateful Dead performed by a solo
guitar player-singer Cheryl loves the music - it’s nearly as
important to her as food and she’s wolfing it down

Perhaps theyre better left unsung
I dont know dont really care
Let there be songs to fill the air

Jonathan Cheryl’s new friend suddenly appears with two
glasses of red wine They listen to the music in silence
watching the crowd of “Dead Heads” accompanying the singer
some of them with their eyes filled with tears

Cheryl notices that Jonathan is connecting with the crowd
She waits for him to look at her and when he does she loves
what she sees

Ripple in still water

When there is no pebble tossed
Nor wind to blow

WILD Green 92

Jonathan takes Cheryl’s hand kisses it and looks away when
he starts to sing along with the crowd

Reach out your hand if your cup be empty
If your cup is full may it be again

Let it be known there is a fountain
That was not made by the hands of men

Cheryl is the only one that is not singing She doesn’t know
the lyrics obviously but it doesn’t stop her from really
enjoying the moment and her company

CHERYL
What time do you finish work

JONATHAN
In an hour

A look between them

WILD Green 93

INT DINER - DUSK 151

Cheryl is sitting on her own at a diner in town She’s eating
a big burger and a large fries (to be moved before 150)

INT CAR - NIGHT 152

Cheryl is in Jonathans car He’s driving down dark country
roads outside Ashland He’s talking a little nervously
Lucinda Williams is playing on his tape-deck

JONATHAN
I love where I live But I’m worried that
girls think I’m taking them somewhere to
chop their heads off with an axe

He turns down a bumpy track

CHERYL
It hadn‘’t occurred to me until you said
that just now

JONATHAN
So why do you trust me

He stops the car They have arrived at a farm in the middle
of nowhere

CHERYL
I guessI don’t know what the
statistics are but it has to be a
minority of axe-murderers who are Lucinda
Williams fans And you have kind eyes
and you live in a tent on an organic
farm If youre a psycho then I’ve
learned nothing about anything

Jonathan leans towards her and kisses her
CHERYL (CONTD)
Mmmm I should use that line on guys more
often

JONATHAN
Youre rad

WILD Blue 94
152

Cheryl tries not to wince at the word

CHERYL
Youre rad too

INT TENT - NIGHT

Darkness and then Jonathan turns on the light and we can
see his tent It’s enormous and lovely You can stand up in
it there’s electric lighting - lamps that look like candles
on cardboard dressers on either side of the double bed - and
a heater There are even books on a little shelf

Cheryl looks around admiringly

CHERYL
Wow This is fantastic

JONATHAN
I know I’m lucky

He looks at Cheryl

JONATHAN (CONT‘D)
Really lucky

He puts his arms around her and kisses her again They fall
onto the bed Jonathan pulls away so that he can speak

JONATHAN (CONTD)
Listen Im not presuming or anything
But if this goes any furtherdo you
have a condom

Cheryl laughs

CHERYL
I’ve been carrying a condom in my pocket
for weeks in case When I looked at
myself in the mirror I decided I wasn’t
taking my pants off for anyone So I left
it in the motel

JONATHAN
That‘s cool

CHERYL
No it’s not Because now I want to take
them off But I have to warn you there’s
some bad stuff under there

JONATHAN
Oh OK What kind of bad stuff

pa

WILD Blue 95

Cheryl laughs

CHERYL
It’s not like contagious bad stuff
Its just

She stands up unbuttons and steps out of her jeans and
pulls down her pants to show him the puckered discolored
skin over her hips

CHERYL (CONTD)
This hike hasn’t done much for my sexual
confidence

Jonathan pulls her towards him and very slowly kisses her
stomach and then moves towards the relevant area

EXT BY THE RIVER - DAWN 154

MONTAGE of Cheryl hiking through Oregon eating up the miles
We hear the old familiar walking rhythm track the creak
and the plod and the click of her ski-pole The landscape is
sometimes lush sometimes steep and rocky In her head she
is composing a letter

CARD ON SCREEN - DAY 71

CHERYL (VO)
Dear Paul Back in Ashland T had sex with

CHERYL (V0)

Here are some questions I’ve been asking
myself What if I forgive myself What if
I was sorry but if I could go back in

differently What if I’d wanted to fuck
every single one of these men What if
heroin taught me something

EXT TRAIL - DUSK 157

camp is set near the lake the stove is burning heating
water and Cheryl is writing the letter that she has been
composing

CHERYL (V0)
What if yes was the right answer instead
of no What if all those things I did
were the things that got me here What if
I was never redeemed What if I already
was I have only another two hundred
miles left to walk Im desperate for it
to be over but I’m terrified too I
have twenty bucks left in the world When
I’m done then Ill have to start living
and I’m nowhere near ready

She looks at what she’s written holds the sheet of paper
above the stove and watches it burn

EXT RANGERS STATION - DAY

Its raining hard the light is fading and Cheryl’s cold and
wet and hurting But she’s approaching a rest stop - theres
a ramshackle collection of dark wooden buildings and a few
picnic tables As Cheryl walks towards it a ranger emerges
from one of the buildings and locks the door

sighs and relents

The boys and Cheryl are all clutching packets and parcels as

distracted Next to the ranger’s station is a paddock
containing a horse The horse wanders down placidly to look
at them

a lead rope around its neck and is wearing a saddle He
sniffs in Cheryls direction makes a step forward and pauses
to assess whether he should continue Cheryl sits still and
watches the animal

CHERYL
Its okay Youre safe in this world

The llama walks closer and stops again Cheryl takes the lead
rope and then pats the animal tentatively at first and then
with more boldness and pleasure An older lady VERA and a

Cheryl stops and looks at the fire In it what’s left of THE
PACIFIC CREST TRAIL VOLUME 1

EXT TRAIL - DAWN 178

Cheryl asleep out in the open She wakes up with a start and
looks down her body hundreds of tiny little black frogs are
hopping all over her sleeping bag She shrieks soundlessly
laughs stands up

EXT TRAIL - DAY B178
CARD ON SCREEN - DAY 94
Cheryl back on the trail She stops to fill her hat full of
the large ripe berries that overhang the trail eating some
as she does so

CHERYL (VO)

It took me years to be the woman my
mother raised

WILD Pink ll

EXT TRAIL - DAY 179
Cheryl rounds a bend and sees something She stops Simon and
Garfunkel’s El Condor Pasa starts to play

CHERYL (V0)
It took me four years seven months and
three days to do it without her I
didnt know where I was going until I got
there

She starts to walk again towards something we can hardly see
through the trees a bridge

EXT TOLLBOOTH - DAY 180

The tollbooth agent waves Cheryl through A sign above the
tollbooth says ‘Bridge Of The Gods’ She starts her walk

across the bridge

CHERYL (V0)
I felt more alone than anyone in the
whole wide world that morning Maybe that
was okay

We follow her She stops next to the structure Her POV -
Beneath her on the road people walking They spot her smile
and wave They turn to look at her The sun is reflecting off
the beautiful blue water She can see fish swimming in the
river She looks up at the blue sky closes her eyes

CHERYL (V0)
I didn’t need to reach with my bare hands
anymore To know that seeing the fish
beneath the surface of the water was
enough That it was everything my
life like all lives mysterious
irrevocable and sacred So very close so
very present so very belonging to me

She opens her eyes and sees a fox sat in the middle of the
road on the other side of the bridge He looks at her for a
moment and leaves

CHERYL (V0)
How wild it was to let it be

Cheryl touches the bridge and smiles Her eyes fill with
tears

Simon and Garfunkel start to sing El Condor Pasa
