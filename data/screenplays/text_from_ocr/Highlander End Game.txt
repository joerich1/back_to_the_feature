WORLD WITHOUT END

OVER BLACK A VOICE
VOICE

IN THE DAYS BEFORE MEMORY THERE WERE THE IMMORTALS WE WERE WITH YOU
THEN AND WE ARE WITH YOU NOW

SWEEP LOW
through CLINGING HIGHLAND MISTS that shroud a land still

in its infancy Cathedral spires of granite Cradled lakes A solitary
vastness

VOICE (contd)

WE HAVE BEEN WORSHIPPED AS GODS MISTAKEN FOR DEMONS AND REVILEDAS
WITCHES WE ARE THE SEEDS OF A MILLION LEGENDS BUT OUR TRUE ORIGINS
ARE UNKNOWN WE SIMPLY ARE

ANCIENT CASTLES dot the landscape whisper of battles long forgotton

VOICE (contd)

WE ARE DRIVEN BY THE CEASELESS FIGHT TO ENDURE NO LIMIT IT IS A
BATTLE THAT KNOWS NO BOUNDRY OF TIME OR PLACE

TWO FIGURES clash with broadswords atop the tallest promontory
VOICE (contd)

TO THE WINNER COMES AN UNKNOWABLE PRIZE YET AN IMMORTAL CAN FIND NO
COMFORT IN VICTORY

MATCH MOVE to the top of an ULTRA-MODERN SKYSCRAPER Swordsmen
continue to battle
VOICE (contd)

BECAUSE IN THE END THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE

Loser falls to the others sword as the HEAVENS CLEAVE in a TITANIC
RUPTURE OF SIGHT AND SOUND

Like the birth of a brand new universe

MACLEOD and ELLENSTEIN ANTIQUES (FORMERLY RUSSELL NASH LTD)

A FACE reflects in the window glass Its RACHEL ELLENSTEIN early
60s now a graying maternal beauty

She moves to the front door reaches out to unlock it

It falls open at her touch Even though the hanging placard is still
flipped to WEâ€™RE CLOSED

Rachel hesitates Draws a shallow breath and steps
inside
INT - ANTIQUE STORE

All those sublime European antiquities now drip with menace Celtic
harp Scottish targe Brooding statuary

She moves deeper into the shadowed recesses flicks on a lamp

Her gaze settles on the one exception to the impeccable order of
things An open wooden case empty

Just the felt impression of a missing broadsword
RACHEL

(icy dread)
Connor

She crosses to the foot of the staircase Listens
A MUSIC BOX

spools a faint tinny madrigal

She climbs the stairs padding softly upward

The music grinds EVER LOUDER in its maddening repetitions Every so
often its punctuated by a CHILDS GIGGLE

AT THE SECOND FLOOR LANDING

Rachel edges around the corner Her breath catches in her throat
BEFORE HER stands a locked wooden cabinet Its been cleaved nearly in
half by the BROADSWORD that still juts hilt-first from the base of the
splintered front panel PHOTO ALBUMS and leather-bound DIARIES have
been shredded and scattered across the floor--

--except for several selected PHOTOGRAPHS skewered onto the sword tip
like a Medieval message spike Rachel struggles to breathe Like shes
taken that sword in her own gut

INSIDE THE CABINET A TELEVISION flickers with videotape of GRAINY HOME

CONNOR teaching RACHEL to ride a horse

CONNOR with RACHEL outside an English boarding school In a train
station At her college graduation

CONNOR and RACHEL in a laughing embrace that only hints at something
deeper

In each new clip Rachel has aged further Connor has not

Rachel steps up to the broadsword wraps both hands around the grip
and jerks it clean of the cabinet
THE SKEWERED PHOTOGRAPHS (flutterd to the floor like dead leaves)
THE VIDEOTAPE ENDS CLICKS OFF

and a NEW IMAGE burns itself onto the screen in perfect digital
clarity Rachel Staring back at herself terror-stricken

She hadnt even noticed it before now The tiny CAMCORDER on the shelf
above the TV with the glowing red light

MOVE IN ON THE TV as Rachel SLOWLY BACKS AWAY Keep moving in on the
TV until the PIXELS SWIM

THE PHONE RINGS shattering the stillness The old rotary phone on the
little Louis XIV stand Its not just beckoning her Its taunting
her

Gathering up the photos and hugging them to her breast Rachel slowly
approaches the phone Any second now youd expect it to stop
ringing nobody home But whoevers on the other end knows better It
keeps right on RINGING Insistant Trembling fingers reach out for
the receiver Slowly lift it off the hook

RACHEL

They crackle and twist in the fire that feeds off them It takes a
moment to realize theyre LIVESTOCK-- oxen pigs goats sheep-- piled

A CRUDE WOVEN-STRAW HUMAN EFFIGY stands astride the pile engulfed in
flame
BEYOND THE FIRE Connor MacLeod and his young wife HEATHER watch from
the steps of their simple isolated home Connor betrays no emotion
Heather looks on in horror

HEATHER

My God what are they

CONNOR

Farm animals Dead of the plague

HEATHER

Why do they torment us with their dead cattle

(no response)

Connor

CONNOR

They think Ive brought this upon them Its a warning

A deeper fear now grips Heather

HEATHER

A warning They drove you from your home They cut you off from your
own people What else could they want

Connor turns away from the flaming heap
CONNOR

Someone to blame

Heather looks off Shivers

HEATHER

Connor leans forward takes her face in his hands
CONNOR

I love you Heather More than anything in this world
She grips his hands Desperately

CONNOR (contd)

HEATHER

CAIOLIN MACLEOD ravaged by neglect and despair strokes her sons
face as if confirming his reality

CAIOLIN

I thought you might be the water horse come to take me on his back and
drown me in the loch

CONNOR

(smiles)

Maybe I am Mother

CAIOLIN

(touches his hair)

Then come let me grab hold of your golden mane and off we go

Connor lifts her from the tattered bed spins her around several giddy
times and sits her upright in a chair

CONNOR

Not before we put some meat on those bones

He rummages through her shelves looking for food Finds
painfully little

CONNOR (contd)

No one comes to look after you

CAIOLIN

Connor feels the tension in Kases voice

Surely as a friend you can look the other way just this once For

FATHER ALASDAIR RAINEY the local priest and inquisitor steps inside
bent over a silver cane Hes gross corpulent and perpetually short

appearance

VILLAGERS of varying stripe crowd nervously behind them

FATHER RAINEY

In the name of the Holy See and the rule of law you are hereby
charged Connor MacLeod with heresy and the practice of black magic

(turns to the villagers)
Take him

The townsmen jostle in place each trying to squeeze backward behind
the other

Heresy is not contagious
Two of the bolder men move forward gripping Connor by the elbows

Once its clear they havent sucked up any demons the others SWARM

INT - STONE CELL - NIGHT

Connor stirs awake in a centuries-old dungeon a dark hole crumbling
and damp

VOICES seem to drip through the porous mortar Taunting vengeful
expectant

He crosses to the barred window that affords him a narrow ground-
level view of THE TOWN COMMONS where a well-attended EXECUTION is now
underway

Connor squints craning to make out the identity of the condemned

TOWNSPEOPLE mingle and mill in front of him obstructing his line-of-
sight

Even as A FAMILIAR VOICE rises above the surrounding chatter

JACOB KASES VOICE

The curse that afflicts one generation will invariably pass its mark
onto the next The ties of blood cannot be severed by word or deed if
in fact your blood is that of your son

Several villagers STEP ASIDE to reveal

CONNORS MOTHER bound to an UPRIGHT STAKE atop a mound of shorn
timber CONNOR siezes with the impossible horror of recognition

CONNOR

No NO
JACOB KASE Makes the sign of the cross as he reads from a writ of
execution He stands atop a primeval CELTIC MONOLITH worn down to the
form of a pedestal Father Rainey wobbles behind him sniffing ammonia
to spell his chronic angina

KASE

Through the infinite compassion of our Lord God you are entitled one
final opportunity to renounce all that is unholy to declare Connor
MacLeod not of your loins and help put an end to the darkness that has
been cast upon this land How say you Caiolin MacLeod

Caiolin lifts her head pale and beatific

CAIOLIN

If your god should persecute me into the next world then I shall
simply have to find myself another

Shocked murmers of outrage shudder through the crowd

Kase steps up and RIPS AWAY Caiolins cherished silver CRUCIFIX with
its distinctive wooden Christ figure

KASE
(holding up Caiolins crucifix)
You wont need this where youre going

CONNOR grabs at the iron window-bars Shakes them until the mortar
chips from their moorings THE RUDDY-FACED EXECUTIONER solemnly
approaches Caiolin Unseen by the bloodlusting crowd he takes out a
small leather sack and drapes it around her neck by the drawstring He
tucks it under her coarse woolen robe and pats it flush against her
chest

EXECUTIONER

(softly)

Black powder It will make short work of your suffering

Caiolin nods He steps down off the pyre Reaches for a BURNING
TORCH CONNOR strains against the bars like a madman Mortar continues
crumbling until one bar actually RIPS AWAY COMPLETELY THE

hurling flaming timbers aside with his bare hands Initially stunned
the townsfolk shrink back watching Connor desperately scatter the

fire Caiolin buries her face in her shoulder biting back the agony
as

Sword in hand Connor stretches upward hacking away the ropes that
bind her oblivious to the fire now crawling in serpentine coils
around his own arms and legs Freed of the ropes Caiolin begins to
slump forward Connor grabs for her arm as THE BLACK POWDER EXPLODES
in a CONCUSSION of FIRE that renders any further hope of rescue
futile

Connor stands atop the burning pyre wicked tongues of flame leaping
off his back and shoulders like fiery wings He throws back his head
and HOWLS to the heavens Fire dances across Connors skin and
clothing as he raises his broadsword and steps down into the crowd

PANDEMONIUM breaks out This isnt just a common witch This is one of
Hells very own Those few foolish enough to attack are cut down
where they stand The rest scatter in mindless PANIC Father Rainey
blocks Connors path Lifts his cross

as hes CUT DOWN by the blind SLASH of Connors sword Connor
steps over Raineys body and keeps coming driving the mob fleeing
into their dwellings Kase crouches blustering over Rainey
KASE

Father Father please--
(tries to staunch the bleeding)
Father--

Raineys eyes open slightly
RAINEY

Who are you

KASE

Your son Its your son-- Jacob

Rainey stares back as if a veil has suddenly been lifted And what he
now sees terrifies him to death

RAINEY

Who are YOU

KASE

He stops Raineys eyes are frozen Dead

CONNOR returns to the flaming pyre refueling his rage with the
sight of his mothers blackened corpse KASE

scoops up a discarded sword leaps to his feet and CHARGES CONNOR
bellowing like a madman Connor whirls around with his sword making
Kase IMPALE HIMSELF on the blade Kase stares wide-eyed and gagging
at Connors smoldering visage-- the depthless black pools of hate that
shroud his eyes Its the last thing Jacob Kase will ever see Connor
opens his fingers and lets him DROP the sword hilt still jutting from
Kases chest Gathering up several chunks of flaming timber Connor
HEAVES them onto the straw-covered rooftops setting them instantly
ABLAZE In short order the village is transformed into a giant
swirling INFERNO Silhouetted against the crimson sky Connor lifts
Caiolins body and turns his back on Glenfinnan for the last time
DISSOLVE TO

EXT - ANCIENT STONE MONASTERY - NIGHT

Standing outside the massive door is a MONK clad in dark hooded
monastic garb Nothing in the panorama would suggest weve just jumped
four centuries into an uncertain future Until--

A PACK OF MOTORCYCLISTS chew their way up the rubbled slope Fishtail
to a stop THE LEADER a tall eclectically-dressed Jamaican dismounts
and approaches the hooded monk

JAMAICAN

You people are extremely hard to find

Monk unshoulders a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN

HOODED MONK

We like it that way

(pumps shotgun)

Now go

The other six INTRUDERS surround the monk His eyes flick from one to
the next-- a buffet of different nationalities all big

JAMATCAN

Take your pick Before you squeeze the trigger a second time youll
be dead

Easy choice Monk levels his gun and BLOWS the Jamaican right off his
feet And sure enough he GAGS before his next trigger-pull A very
nasty SERRATED BLADE retracts into a wooden hilt Monk drops in a heap
as his assailant a WIRY ASIAN turns for the door joined by the
others IN THE VERY NEXT INSTANT the heavy oak-and-iron door SWINGS
OPEN with a BARRAGE of AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE--

The intruders are CUT DOWN where they stand THREE MORE HOODED MONKS
appear in the doorway wielding ASSAULT RIFLES They grimly regard the
bodies

MONK 1

Take the heads Just in case
Saws and cleavers are pulled by the other two guards while Guard 1
keeps his gun trained on the corpses

VOICE

Dont bother Really

A FIGURE stands in shadow his face UNSEEN We catch

only a brief glimpse of a PRIESTâ€˜S COLLAR Guard 1 whips his rifle
toward the Stranger Stranger diverts it with the tip of his sword
Bullets go nowhere One slash and the guard is gone Two more slashes
and his comrades fall Stranger kicks the body of the dead Jamaican
as he steps through the open doorway

STRANGER

Dont be long

INT - MONASTERY - NIGHT

FOLLOW THE STRANGER through a maze of chambers and DOWN into
serpentine catacombs He KICKS THROUGH a DOOR into AN INNER ROOM
cavernous and dripping where even the air seems septic A few dim
candles illuminate A DOZEN MEN bound to complicated almost Giger-
esque chairs Arms legs and faces have been immobilized by crossing
flats of metal BOLTED into flesh and wood From the wild overgrowth of
hair and beard and the impossibly long curled fingernails its a
good guess none of them have moved a muscle in years

Except for a pale CUSTODIAN standing in a corner trembling silently
Stranger stands at the threshold his face obscured by flickering
shadows He scans the living corpses

STRANGER

So its true

He moves slowly among them

STRANGER (contd)

What sacrifices they made of you all Warehoused like rotting pieces
of meat

He pauses to lift up a downcast head Gazes into the shackled face
The eyes are covered by strips of rusted

iron the face by tangled beard
STRANGER (contd)

Tell me-- is this the better way Im sure youve had some time to
reflect on it

One by one THE RECENTLY-DEAD INTRUDERS filter into the room led by
the Jamaican Blood stipples their clothes streaks their faces But

they are in every other sense fully-restored

Stranger straightens swivels around to the terrified Custodian
Custodian backpeddles into the wall

STRANGER

Which one is Connor MacLeod

CUSTODIAN

I-- I dont know They never told me names
STRANGER

(low seething)

Dont Lie To Me

CUSTODIAN

I swear I dont know

Stranger grabs him under the chin lifts him to his toes
STRANGER

You need to understand one thing my gimpy friend I dont care about
the Game I dont care about the rules I dont even care about these
other pathetic souls you lock away as a barrier to the Prize

The Custodian stares back uncomprehending

STRANGER (contd)

(squeezes his throat)

I want Connor MacLeod Give me MacLeod and Ill leave And you can go
right on pretending that what you do here actually matters

The custodian lifts a shaking finger RACK FOCUS TO
THE PRISONER IN THE LAST CHAIR Even with an iron slat across his eyes
he is unmistakably Connor MacLeod Stranger lets go of the custodian
turns

STRANGER

Long time

Connor strains to lift his head His voice comes weak and drug-heavy
CONNOR

Who are you

STRANGER

Youll know soon enough

Just got up and left

way to be removed from the Game forever The price is unimaginably

step on a single insect to harm a blade of grass was a violation of
their creed They placed themselves into an extreme form of protective

Gapes up at--

that ECLIPSES the rising sun

SILHOUETTE

Duncan puts a hand to his chest touches the worst of his several
lethal wounds Utter confusion stitches his face

SILHOUETTE (contd)

firebombing nothing has been

spared Rachel and Connors richly-cultivated collection has been
reduced to a bitter moonscape One can only shudder at the degree of
overkill that went into this attack Duncan climbs the back stairs to
THE SECOND FLOOR LOFT which is even worse Ash and cinder are
virtually all that remain of Connors home

Pausing at the far wall Duncan yanks down an old charred tapestry
revealing

AN INNER DOOR

deliberately hidden from view He dips down retrieves a key from
under a loose floorboard and opens the heavily- reinforced door

ENTERING he finds himself in a LARGE CIRCULAR ROOM surrounded by a
staggering display of ARTIFACTS drawn from centuries of personal
history Were looking at the sum total of Connor MacLeods existance
stacked floor to ceiling

Duncan moves among the mementos smiles as he lifts them an old
Scottish coin pocket flask a faded PHOTO of himself in a World War

Duncans LUNGE misses Connor by a mile He stumbles upright in a grand

hall streaked by SUNLIGHT from floor- to-ceiling windows Duncan and
Connor face off with duelling swords sporting black waistcoak andd
knee breeches in the manner of the times Several other elegant
FENCING PAIRS spar in this most genteel version of the ancient
bloodsport a far cry from the corpse-littered battlefield seen
earlier A little mustachioed PUFFER darts between the duellists with
lint brush pail and towel as Connor and Duncan re- engage in a rapid
series of strikes and parries

CONNOR

Youve improved greatly
DUNCAN

You really think so

Connor executes a simple combination that sendsDuncans sword flying
one way his body the other

CONNOR
No Im just being gracious

Duncan recovers sets his feet Puffer skitters over brushes the dust
off Duncans coat dabs his sweat and puffs the back of his hair

Duncan swats him away They take en-garde position Connor points his
blade

CONNOR (contd)

Remember youre only immortal as long as your head remains attached
to those shoulders

Duncan lunges again Misses and hits the deck

CONNOR (contd)

Which in your case might not be long at all

He puts his blade to Duncans neck Humor evaporates

CONNOR (contd)

What we give up to our adversary in defeat Duncan is evervthingq
Duncan stares up at him uncomprehending

CONNOR (contd)
We call it The Quickening-- our strength our knowledge our life
essence-- it all flows into the victor feeds him makes him stronger
in ways you cant possibly comprehend Its what drives other
Immortals to kill us And what forces us to be better-- smarter-- than
the rest

He takes Duncan by the arm jerks him to his feet

CONNOR (contd)

Survival Learn it

Duncan goes on the attack What he lacks in technique he makes up for
in determination Almost Connor sidesteps Duncans next lunge swats
his blade flat across Duncans ass and sends him plowing face-first
into the floor Duncan re-engages Connor in fighting stance Puffer
races up behind Duncan again meticulously dusts his backside Reaches
around and plucks an unsightly piece of lint off his crotch with thumb
and forefinger

DUNCAN

(whirls around)

You mind

Connor clucks his tongue

CONNOR (contd)

Allow me

He squares Duncanâ€˜s shoulders and steps back Considers

CONNOR (contd)

Unh uh

He steps up and swivels Duncan around until heâ€˜s facing the opposite
way

CONNOR (contd)

If you should ever again find yourself backside to a blade just
keep this in mind

He proceeds to take Duncan through a move thats dazzling in its
inherent simplicity-- a move that winds up with Duncans blade
whisking perilously close across Connors throat
CONNOR (contd)

Its a coup de fin

He catches Duncans sword-fist in his own holds it immobile
CONNOR (contd)

Properly executed even you cannot prevent your blade from finding its
mark

DUNCAN

Properly executed well never have this talk again

Duncan and Connors eyes lock They break

TRANSITION BACK TO

Duncan suddenly SIEZES UP with a strange disquiet and ringing in the
ears known as THE BUZZ Its the sense of another Immortal

appears at the top of the stairs She saunters toward him glancing
around

She takes her time checking out the place before stepping up to

The ragged crop of her hair and the slashing trowel application of
makeup impart a kind of crazed anti- beauty Like a post-nuclear Barbi
doll

Duncan regards her intrigued and wary

DUNCAN

Who are you

YOUNG WOMAN

A friend
Those two words instantly recall the mystery voice on the
phone

YOUNG WOMAN (contd)

Or lover Or wife Take your pick

Memory jogs with a sudden lurch

DUNCAN

Kate

YOUNG WOMAN

Atta boy cept Im Faith now Part of the makeover Like it
She runs a playful finger across his chest

FAITH

Funny how the time slips by huh You wake up one day and ohmigod--
Airplanes

DUNCAN

Whyre you here

FAITH

Remember our wedding day Duncan I do

She takes him by the hands and leads him into an
impromptu dance

FAITH (contd)

We danced the Highland Fling

She spins under his arm circles back into his embrace
FAITH (contd)

I felt like we were flying

Her sinuous body moves in perfect sync with his
FAITH (contd)
And that wed never come down
She spins out of his arms again--

--and SPIN KICKS him across the FACE BLOOD spatters from his nose
mouth

FAITH (contd)
Of course we did come down Didnt we

(kicks him again)

Crashinq

Duncan staggers backward into a concrete stanchion Recovers
They stand facing each other across a gulf centuries wide
DUNCAN

(spitting blood)

Why are you here

FAITH

Isnt it obvious I wanted to see you again

Duncan tenses at--â€”

THE ROAR OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES

His eyes track the SOUND Its directly BELOW him

EXT - STREET OUTSIDE ANTIQUE STORE

THREE MOTORCYCLES hop the curb SLICE through the open door to the
antique store

INT - ANTIQUE STORE
and SPIRAL up the BACK STAIRS
INT - LOFT

Duncans eyes flick upward to a NEW SOUND directly above him as--

and
EXT - ROOF - DAY
A FOURTH BIKE
VAULTS the NARROW GAP between buildings and LANDS

Knobby tires SLAM onto the rooftop squirrelling wild across the
tarred surface before shuddering to a stop

A jackbooted heel digs in and grinds to a stop

Biker suddenly BACKWHEELS around BLASTS through the

ROOF ACCESS DOOR

and disappears inside

TWO MORE BIKERS

follow suit SLAMMING DOWN onto the roof like alien invaders
INT - LOFT

Duncan reacts But its not just the full-throttle howl of approaching
bikes

Its the BUZZ of approaching IMMORTALS
THE BIKERS

now crest the stairs and fan out into the loft-- Same group we saw
outside the monastery

Tricked out in everything from Keds to chainmail they drag a variety
of weapons in their trailing hands-- sword baseball bat mace dao
and chain-whip

The tips make a scraping noise across the floor thats deliberately
unsettling

They surround Duncan cutting off any avenue of escape Nobody moves
or speaks Just the low staccato growl of idling two-stroke engines

Duncan takes a step backward Looks to Faith
DUNCAN

Whore they
FAITH

More friends

PAN THE FACES CARLOS from Bed-Stuy BUG from Kyoto WINSTON from
Jamaica SARGE from Shreveport and CRACKER BOB from nowhere in
particular

And then theres CALVIN

A swaggering Immortal from the hes traded brute force in on a brand
new weapon of choice A DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA

CALVIN
Make it pretty now Its the bottom of the ninth

BIKERS DISMOUNT and CONVERGE on Duncan swinging their weapons to
limber up

Duncan backs away This is unheard of-- Immortals packing like
jackals

DUNCAN

What-- its a team sport now
CALVIN

(zooming in)

Whole new ballgame

THREE IMMORTALS ATTACK Theyre good Duncans better About three
times better

CALVIN
jockeys his camcorder-- GOES IN TIGHT on Duncan
CALVIN

Sup with the new blood huh Whos gonna lay him out Take his secret
sauce

WINSTON

the tall Jamaican stands off to one side watching the
lone holdout

CALVIN (contd)

Nope Too proud Old school

INTERCUT - VIDEO VIEWFINDER

Image lurches and jostles as Calvin mixes it up with the combatants

CALVIN (0S)

How bout you Carlos You good for it Carlos--
CARLOS HURTLES THROUGH FRAME Lands hard

CALVIN (0S)

Ill catch you later

SWISH PAN TO

SWORD

sparking off chainmail

HANDS AND FEET

pounding flesh

BODIES

slamming into walls

BLOOD MAYHEM PAIN

And Calvin catching it all up close and personal
CALVIN (contd)

Sarge is down Cracker Bobs down

But Carlos got some kick Still got some kick

Carlos crawls to his feet oozing blood and spite
CALVIN (contd)

Like the man says you gotta play with the small hurts
Carlos LUNGES--

Duncan lays him out flat again then swivels around to face--
BUG

who straightens up to his full five-foot frame

CALVIN (contd)

Say hello to my man BUG and his ugly- stick

Bug brandishes a simple metal ROD with a woven grip Nothing much to
speak of

Until he squeezes the grip--
--and SIX BLADES EJECT SIMULTANEOUSLY

The two on each end are SWORD BLADES one for piercing one for
slashing

Jutting perpendicular to the shaft like an insane Swiss Army knife
are twin sets of DAGGERS-- two for stabbing and two sawtoothed
SWORDBREAKERS

And then theres the shaft itself if youre in need of a

good old-fashioned battering ram

CALVIN (contd)

Like it Came from a Tamaric swordsmith

(grins)

Who smoked a lotta very wicked stuff

Bug opens up a multi-pronged BARRAGE on Duncan

Duncan adapts to the first assault-- only to find himself reacting to
an entirely new set of insane moves

CALVIN (contd)
Uhp--- Say welcome back to Carlos

Carlos cuts in yet again swinging for the stands He fans several
times before Duncan backfists him across the nose and dumps him back
onto the floor

Duncan spins back to Bug as the wiry Asian lifts his lethal metal rod
again and grins

But this time as he SQUEEZES the release mechanism--â€”
--Duncan KICKS IT shoving it flush against Bugs chest
SNICK SNICK

two PIVOTING DAGGERS slice into the dumbstruck Immortal He falls
backward WAILING like a stuck pig

A BOOMING VOICE freezes everyone in their tracks
VOICE

Thats enough

All eyes converge on

THE STRANGER

who stands at a distance cloaked in murky halflight
STRANGER

Im sorry Duncan When it comes to discipline the first hundred
years are the hardest

Duncan lowers his katana turns to the Stranger as--
CARLOS

painfully hauls himself upright and suddenly BULLDOZES Duncan clear
through one of the immense loft windows

Duncans launched AIRBORNE in a plume of shattered glass
still clutching his katana
Carlos hooks an arm around the empty window-frame and watches with

unvarnished satisfaction as the body SPIKES onto an upright iron ROD
jutting from the construction site below
STRANGER
What was that
CARLOS

(squinting)

Full gainer with a quarter twist

STRANGER

I thought I told you to stop

CARLOS
Yeah well I stopped
STRANGER (contd)

Are you challenging my authority

Degree of difficulty-- not very

Carlos does his best to ignore him

STRANGER (contd)

Because the only way to challenge my authority is to kill me

CARLOS

(turns away)
Hey hey take it easy man
STRANGER (contd)

Is that clear

In the split second it takes Carlos to turn back from the window
Stranger is right there in his face

CARLOS

Shit

STRANGER

IS THAT CLEAR

the
Stranger takes Carlos sword and yanks it uo to his own neck -
STRANGER (contd)

Heres your chance

Carlos stares wide-eyed Pride wont let him back down
Fear wont let him proceed

STRANGER (contd)

Take it You wont have another

We can FEEL the SUDDEN HAMMERING of Carlos HEART
CARLOS

Youre crazy man

STRANGER

Am I Then go ahead

(rubs his neck across the blade)

Stop the madness

CARLOS

Hey--

STRANGER

Or walk away in perpetual fear of your own shadow
(beat)

Tell me Carlos Can you live with that Can you live with the fear
Can you live with the weakness

THUMP-THUMP-THUMP-THUMP--â€”
STRANGER (contd)

Weakness Carlos Isnt that why youre here with me Isnt that why
youâ€˜re ALL here with me Face it youre nothing but

(savoring)
cattle
Blood POUNDS in Carlos eyes He YANKS back the sword
CRIES OUT and SLASHES for the Strangers neck
CLOSE ON STRANGERS HAND

as it catches his wrist and diverts the blade around to Carlos own
throat wedging it up tight under his chin

STRANGER (contd)

God loves you I dont

In one vicious UP-SLICE Stranger cuts through bone and
sinew stopping just short of a clean sever

Carlos gags and gurgles in liquid protest

STRANGER (contd)

(whispers)

They say the worst part Carlos is those last few seconds when you
find yourself staring at your own headless body

SNICK--
He sends Carlos head tumbling to the floor
STRANGER (contd)

Of course its pure speculation since nobody ever lives to tell about
it

HOLD ON CARLOS EYES

staring in pure unknowable horror at his own body
twitching several yards away

A tiny ARC of electrical ESSENCE crackles from the neck
THE OTHERS

bear mute witness to the GLOWING TENDRILS of ENERGY that stutter
across the walls and ceiling
EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW

Duncan lies IMPALED on a JUTTING SHAFT OF RE-BAR as an UNMARKED PANEL
VAN screeches INTO FRAME

His eyes stare sightless upward as
THE LOFT WINDOWS

EXPLODE with unearthly HOWLS of stretching metal and pulverizing
concrete

SHOCKWAVES strafe the walls blowing out mortar and brick
POWER LINES SNAP and LASH against the building spitting
fiery plumes of SPARKS

INT - LOFT

Seen from behind the Stranger absorbs the QUICKENING in a series of
wild electro-shock convulsions

EXT - CONSTRUCTION SITE BELOW

Several darkly-clad MEN jump from the panel van and race up to Duncan
With pit crew efficiency one takes a mondo set of BOLT CUTTERS to the
metal stake while the others grab Duncan by the arms and ankles A
fourth throws open the cargo door

Snap-lift they TOSS Duncan in the back of the van

INT - LOFT SAME

Arms outstretched and rigid head thrown back in silent rapture the
Stranger RISES slowly off the floor suspended Christ-like in the air

BLINDING HALOES of PURE RADIANT ESSENCE engulf him a lifeforce beyond
human understanding

THE OTHERS

watch transfixed Theyve seen it all before but it never ceases to
amaze and terrify them

CUT TO

DARKNESS
Which becomes a harsh blast of LIGHT

DUNCANS EYES

flutter open squint at the glare Hes strapped to the
same Giger-like chair immobilized Standing around him

are hooded members of that same monk-like order in what is
essentially a dungeon

One of them MATTHEW steps forward His steel-gray eyes are familiar
Hes the one who followed Duncan through customs

As he reaches to cinch closed one of the iron cuffs with a thick metal
dowel he reveals a distinctive TATTOO across his inner forearm One
that Duncan instantly recognizes

DUNCAN

Watchers

Matthew simply nods
DUNCAN

Watchers observe They dont interfere

MATTHEW

True And we were more than happy to perform our traditional function
Believe me its a whole lot easier charting the history of Immortals
than it is running a day care center for them Unfortunately our role
has changed somewhat

DUNCAN

Why

MATTHEW

Because the rules have been broken

DUNCAN

Not by me

MATTHEW
Youre not the one were worried about

Matthew moves to the other side of the chair Pegs the
arm cuff and ratchets down a redundant set of bindings
MATTHEW (contd)

One of your kind has gone renegade In doing so hes gained himself a
sizeable advantage One that will be impossible to overcome

DUNCAN

Nobodys unbeatable

MATTHEW

Hes surrounded himself with Immortals loyal only to him He uses holy
ground as a safe haven And every head taken in battle is reserved for
him alone each Quickening-- hundreds upon hundreds-- taken by just
one man Yes Duncan He is unbeatable

Matthew pours a Scotch Glenmorangie Holds it to

Duncans lips like the final offering to a condemned man

MATTHEW (contd)

Worse still far worse is that hes become a perversion to the Game
And if he prevails that perversion will resonate through everything

we know For eternity In ways we cant possibly comprehend

Duncan tugs at his bonds Knows whats in store for him

MATTHEW (contd)

There must always be two of your kind As long as there are two and
theyre kept from fighting the Prize is safe The Sanctuary must
continue

DUNCAN

Get yourself another volunteer

MATTHEW

We had a number of volunteers Sadly thats no longer the case
Another WATCHER steps up and forces an IRON FACE SHACKLE down over
Duncans head

MATTHEW (contd)

Youll be warehoused Hidden away So the Prize can remain safe
Duncan struggles frantically against his bonds

DUNCAN

Youre insane

MATTHEW

For the world Duncan We do this for the world

The Watcher takes two large BOLTS and begins to screw the mask
directly into Duncans skull

DUNCANS POV

BLACKNESS accompanied by BRIGHT SEARING FLASHES of
AGONY

MATTHEWS VOICE (contd)

Dont worry The drugs should kick in momentarily

All external SOUND is slowly DROWNED OUT by the POUNDING IN HIS OWN
BRAIN

A POUNDING interspersed with jarring synaptic flashes of

BATTLE Killing Dying Killing again Dying again
The recycling nightmare finally RECEDES back into
NOTHINGNESS

Then a NEW SOUND Distant Grind of metal on bone Bolts being
unscrewed

Iron plate lifts from his eyes flood of LIGHT

Once again Duncan SQUINTS up at a FACE This time the blurred
swimming features of a familiar Irish-American mug
DUNCAN
(WOOZY )
Dawson

JOE DAWSON familiar to many as Duncans one friend inside the
Watchers smiles back

DAWSON
You look like shit
DUNCAN

How long

DAWSON

Week maybe longer We cant talk here

(unstraps Duncan)

We gotta go

Dawson reacts to the sound of APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
DAWSON (contd)

(urgently)

Now Can you walk

DUNCAN

Think so

He takes one step and pitches forward onto his face
DUNCAN (contd)

Potent whiskey

He clambers to his feet and follows Dawson out of the chamber

EXT - ARMORY - NIGHT

Dawson and Duncan emerge from a nondescript cinderblock armory
overgrown Cold War relic recently co-opted by the Watchers

an
They duck some scurrying guards plow through thick underbrush to

A HIDDEN CAR

and climb inside

INT - CAR TRAVELLING - NIGHT

DUNCAN

You knew about The Sanctuary

DAWSON

Just because Im a Watcher doesnt mean Im always in the loop
DUNCAN

I dont buy that

Dawson averts his gaze Stares ahead

DAWSON

I really struggled with it yknow the idea of keeping guys on ice
like that But I couldnt argue with the logic Least not til they
went after you

(squeals hard onto the main drag)

Guess that put it a little too close to home

DUNCAN

I owe you

Dawson slides Duncans katana out from under the seat Hands it over
DAWSON

Do me a favor buddy Live to pay me back

DUNCAN

What happened to the bodies

Dawson winces slightly Keeps driving

DUNCAN (contd)
Cmon Joe

DAWSON

Listen-- I got you outta one jam Dont push your luck
DUNCAN

need to see them

DAWSON

Theyre dead Trust me

DUNCAN

Was one of them Connor MacLeod
DAWSON

Yes

DUNCAN

Let me see the bodies

DAWSON

The heads are gone You really dont wanna go there

DUNCAN

have to Joe I have to know

Dawson jerks the car to a sudden shuddering stop

DAWSON

Alright Alright-- If I tell you thats it Im outta here Youre
on your own I cant be a part of this OK

DUNCAN
OK
DAWSON

OK
Dawson stares at Duncan A beat then

DAWSON

Fuck Im a part of it

He throws the car back into gear and fishtails back onto the road
CUT TO

A VIEW THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

of a forlorn and forgotten CEMETERY Nothing marks its perimeter but a
toppled gate and some trampled barbed wire

DAWSON

It was a Christian burial Decent They said all the right words
DUNCAN

I cant begin to tell you how reassuring that is Pull over

WIDE

Dawson pulls over He and Duncan get out of the car

DAWSON

Needless to say with a dozen unexplainable corpses they had to go a
bit off the beaten track

EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET

From here it looks like just a barren hillside littered with broken
and crumbling marble

CLOSER

Duncan and Dawson tramp up the shallow incline

DAWSON (contd)

What do you think youre gonna find when you get up there
DUNCAN

I dont know
DAWSON

Im not digging Get that through your skull right now Not these
hands

CRESTING THE RIDGE

Twelve freshly-mounded graves come into view gouged into the rubbled
downslope like wounds each set off by a simple wooden cross

Duncan stops when he reaches the first grave Stiffens
DAWSON

What

Duncan remains frozen staring seemingly at nothing
DAWSON (contd)

My dog used to do that with locked closets I hate that
DUNCAN

Shh

Dawson listens Nothing but the soft moan of WIND
DUNCAN (contd)

Hes here

DAWSON

Tell me Im not here for a seance

Duncan squints Feels the BUZZ Slight but unmistakable

WHAT HE SEES

A row of stunted oaks thick and gnarled againt the setting sun
CLOSER

Standing against the trunk silhouette on silhouette is the ghostly
form of a MAN Barely discernible his features are hidden in shadow

Duncan slowly approaches the figure Dawson hangs back
nervous and slightly twitchy

CLOSER STILL

The figure steps up to greet Duncan Sunlight brightens the face of
CONNOR MACLEOD

who smiles as he embraces Duncan in the traditional bear- crush of
Scottish clansmen

DUNCAN

Sorry I missed your funeral

CONNOR

All told it was a bit underwhelming
DUNCAN

So it would seem

They break The brief joy suddenly drains from Connors face-- his
eyes speak of diffuse faraway suffering

CONNOR

Why are you here

DUNCAN

Ten years ago you skipped out on a bartab

Connors expression hardens

CONNOR

You need to know something

He steps up to Duncan locks eyes

CONNOR (contd)

Every life I touch ends Brutally And for no reason Its a curse
thats followed me for centuries I cant outrun it and I cant

outlive it

(beat)
Youre my last friend in this world Duncan I left for your own good
It was better that you didnt know where

DUNCAN

The Sanctuary

CONNOR

Yes The Sanctuary
DUNCAN

But you escaped
CONNOR

No I didnt escape

FLASH BACK TO THE SANCTUARY as the STRANGER moves toward a shackled
Connor MacLeod

CONNOR (VO)

I was freed

As before the immobilized Connor stirs in a drug-addled haze
CONNOR

Who are you

STRANGER

Youll know soon enough

CONNORS POV - THROUGH THE BOTTOM EDGE OF HIS FACEPLATE

All Connor can see is the Strangers HAND as it reaches down and PULLS
THE PIN from one of Connors arm shackles The cuff FALLS OPEN

Stranger turns away A beat later come the unmistakable SOUNDS of
SLAUGHTER that fill the room to a DEAFENING CRESCENDO

CONNOR (VO)
I couldnt see the slaughter I only heard it

BACK TO CEMETERY
We can still see the agony playing out in Connors eyes He turns
away sees

JOE DAWSON

still standing on the ridge swatting at the occasional deerfly
CONNOR

Whos he

DUNCAN

The reason I didnt become your replacement

Dawson casually removes one of his legs and vigorously shakes it
upside down

CONNOR

Whats he doing now

DUNCAN

Sand in the shoe would be my guess

Connor suddenly gazes beyond Dawson to

THE NEXT HILLSIDE

and the FAINT SOUND OF APPROACHING MOTORCYCLES He stiffens
CONNOR

You were followed

One by one a HALF-DOZEN MOTORCYCLISTS crest the surrounding hills and
come to a menacing stop

DUNCAN
Yeah I was meaning to tell you about those guys

Dawson fumbles to put his leg back on Hops a full 360 as he watches
the intruders surround them

TWO MORE

approach on foot following the same path Duncan and Dawson took
One is Faith The other The Stranger

Except hes no stranger to Connor MacLeod Far from it
Connor goes rigid Breathing stops

His nightmares finally taken human form

MOVE IN for our first clear look at

JACOB KASE

striding forward bigger than death

His is a face hewn by Godâ€˜s sharpest blade every angle cold
remorseless Puritannical

As before hes clad in basic black accented by the stark white of a
priests collar

CONNOR

(ice)

Jacob Kase

Connor edges back his coat Hand seeks out the grip of his sword
Duncan grabs his arm

DUNCAN

Not here

CONNOR

Walk away Duncan

Kase and Faith continue toward them Connors rage seems to ratchet up
with every step

DUNCAN
Youre on holy ground Remember the rules
Pure radiating hate seethes in Connors eyes

CONNOR
The rules be damned
Kase stops inches from Connors face Cooly regards the sword
KASE

Look at you Youd think after half a millenium youd learn to keep
that youd learn to keep that temper of yours in check

Gone is any trace of brogue Hes a fully-assimilated New Yorker now
Connors fingers tighten around the swordgrip

CONNOR

Just tell me where Kase
KASE

If all I wanted was to kill you youd have been dead a very long time
ago Connor

Something roils under Kases controlled exterior A rage every bit as
consuming as Connors

KASE (contd)

But your death alone could never appease the innocent souls you
slaughtered

FLASH TO SEVERAL OF GLENFINNANS VILLAGERS being MOWED DOWN by
Connors mindless fury

KASE (contd)
It couldnt even begin to appease mine

FLASH TO KASE as he drops to his knees gagging blood RUN THROUGH by
Connors blade

KASE (contd)
Worst of all you murdered a man of God Who raised me as his son

FLASH TO A FATHER RAINEY as Connor brings his sword CLEAVING DOWN on
him

KASE (contd)
and no punishment conceived by man can ever atone for that
AFTERMATH OF MASSACRE

Scattered wisps of smoke gambol across the demolished commons leading
up to the CORPSE of JACOB KASE

KASE (contd)

What you never could have expected was that youd leave behind this
one humble servant

Kases body lies there as cold as the Highland dawn
KASE (contd)

who would trade eternity itself to make you pay
HIS EYES

snap open

And were once again TRANSPORTED BACK TO

EXT - CEMETERY - DAY

Kase steps closer revelling in this moment

KASE

Look back over the endless travesties of your life and youll see me
Always there waiting in the shadows

(beat)
When friends and lovers are wiped from your sight Im there
KASE (contd)

When those you cherish die abruptly and for no reason Im there

kicks a clod of dirt onto a grave)

And when a handful of misguided and pathetic idiots just happen to
share your own private hell

(shrugs)

Guess who
He walks a full circle around Connor

All the while Kase addresses Connor Faith never takes her eyes off
Duncan

KASE (contd)

But if you think it ends here my ancient friend youre wrong
Very Very Wrong

Kase turns back to Faith Pulls his sword and without
warning SLICES it across her throat

Faith reflexively GASPS stumbles backward leaving--
A WOOD AND SILVER CRUCIFIX

dangling on Kases swordtip

FOLLOW THE CRUCIFIX

as he swings it around and offers it up to Connor

KASE

Thought you might be wanting this I kept it for you

FLASH TO CONNORS MOTHER bound to the stake as Kase rips the crucifix
from her neck

BACK TO SCENE

Connor stares down at the crucifix now in his open palm
KASE (contd)

For old times sake

ase puts an arm around Faith

KASE (contd)

Want to find me again Connor Just put your hands together

KASE (contd)

(winks)
And pray

He gives Faith a little shove and they both start downhill
THE SURROUNDING BIKERS

gun their engines and ride off on billowing plumes of dust

Connor makes no move to follow Strangely silent and impassive hes
like a warrior gutted by an invisible sword

Duncan puts a hand on his shoulder

DUNCAN

Whatever it is

Connor swipes away Duncans hand starts walking

DUNCAN (contd)

I can help you Connor

Connor stops swivels back Eyes dead

CONNOR

Nobody can help me

He walks off alone a ghost against a sea of gravestones
DUNCAN

CONNOR--

Duncan watches his friend depart helpless Turning back he sees
FAITH AND KASE

stopped halfway down the hill They seem to be arguing Kase turns
abruptly and strides off

CLOSE ON FAITH

She stands there a moment sullenly rubbing her throat Duncans VOICE
spins her back around

DUNCAN (0S)
Problem

FAITH

I get a bit fussy whenever somebody points a sword at me

(dry)

Goes a long way back

Their eyes fix on one another Air thickens Buzzes with electricity
DUNCAN

Just one question After all these years

(re Kase)

Why him

Faith glances down at Kase who stands waiting at the base of the
hill Considers

FAITH

Because Ive never known anyone who had such an amazing capacity for
hate

(beat)

Except me

On that she brushes past Duncan and rejoins Kase

TRANSITION TO

EXT - IRISH COUNTRYSIDE 17TH CENTURY - DAY

Duncan and Connor ride side by side on horseback They reach a
RIVERBANK

where a YOUNG WOMAN and her elderly CONSORT are detained at a crude
wooden TOLL GATE

Eight or nine disreputable-looking HIGHWAYMEN surround their carriage

Connor rides up to what would appear to be the LEADER He has the most
teeth
CONNOR

Whats going on
HIGHWAYMAN

The lady here refuses to pay her toll
CONNOR

Toll for what

HIGHWAYMAN

Passage over the bridge

Connor cranes his eyes upriver and down

CONNOR

I see no bridge

HIGHWAYMAN

What do you think pays for the bridge

Connor considers then turns back to the lady with a
shrug

CONNOR

The man has a point

Despite her sweeping auburn hair and natural beauty we now recognize
the young woman as FAITH from an earlier era

Her original name is CATHERINE MARY DEVANEY
CATHERINE

These men are liars and scoundrels Theyâ€˜ve preyed upon us three years
running

CONNOR
This true

HIGHWAYMAN
A good sturdy bridge is not an overnight accomplishment Sir
CONNOR

Exactly what may I ask have you accomplished so far
HIGHWAYMAN

(proudly)

The tollgate

Duncan trots around the tollgate and up alongside Connor He leans
over to the highwayman

DUNCAN

Excuse me but by whose authority do you act
HIGHWAYMAN

(holds up scroll)

By deed of the King

DUNCAN

Might I see that

Highwayman slowly unravels the parchment scroll The nearly-illegible
scrawl suggests random words copied by an illiterate

DUNCAN (contd)

Does the King always sign his name with an X
Highwaymans cronies reach for their swords
HIGHWAYMAN

He was in a hurry

All eyes hover on Duncans reaction Two of the highwaymen edge around
behind Catherine and her elderly consort ready to gut them both at a
moments notice

Duncan tracks them with his eyes

DUNCAN
(nods)

Busy man the King

(to Catherine)

I suggest you pay the gentlemen and be on your way
CATHERINE

His deed is a fake

DUNCAN

Thats a matter of opinion

CATHERINE

You Sir are no better than they

DUNCAN

Thats also a matter of opinion

(to Connor)

Shall we

Connor sizes up his young protege Gives a dubious nod
CONNOR

Lead on

CATHERINE

You cant just leave

DUNCAN

Youre right

He tosses a handful of gold coins to the Highwayman
DUNCAN (contd)

Good luck with the bridge

He kicks his horse into a brisk trot Connor reluctantly follows

suit
They cross the river through ankle-deep water
CONNOR
cant believe you gave those bastards your money

DUNCAN

t wasnt my money

Duncan pulls a cinched canvas BAG overstuffed with coins from his
overcoat

DUNCAN (contd)
It was theirs

RACK FOCUS TO the duped HIGHWAYMEN scrambling onto their horses and
riding hard in frantic pursuit

They hit the river at a gallop kicking up giant shimmering fantails
of water

DUNCAN (contd)

By the time they reach us the young lady and her escort should be
safely out of harmâ€˜s way

The pursuers close the gap in seconds

Connor grins approvingly Draws his sword and glances
over at Duncan

CONNOR

Shall we

Duncan FLICKS his own sword lets the hilt auto-rotate around his open
palm and snaps it vertical He nods back at Connor

DUNCAN
Lets
Together they whirl around to face the onrushing horde

THEY BATTLE
in the middle of the shallow river Nine maniacal thieves against two
sporting Immortals

The spray of water the slashing of swords and the pounding of hooves
all build to an operatic crescendo

Duncans improved since Ravenna He easily scatters three of his
adversaries before engaging the blood-crazed LEADER

This time its Connor who finds himself in trouble He tumbles from
his horse and goes down losing his sword in the river

DUNCAN

suddenly winds back and FLINGS his sword at his opponent like a
throwing dagger

BLADE

whistles past the dumbstruck highwaymans head Which was not the
intended target

-as we discover when we follow its end-over-end
flight
straight into CONNORS OUTSTRETCHED HAND

Connor parries his attackers drives them backward onto their asses
then swivels around and TOSSES the sword back to

DUNCAN

who catches it ducks the highwaymans next swing and swiftly sends
him packing

CONNOR

recovers his own sword which is enough to send the last of their
attackers into a full-on stumbling retreat

They both stand watching as
THE CARRIAGE
jostles safely across the river

CLOSE ON CATHERINE
as she looks back at Duncan She gives Duncan a knowing smile thats
as innocent as it is seductive

CONNOR
(watching Duncan)

You know that stirring in your gut Its not just simple lust my
friend

DUNCAN

I know

CONNOR

Ah but do you really
MATCH CUT TO

FAITH

as she and Kase drive away from the cemetery in a late model
convertible

EXT - CEMETERY - SUNSET

Joe Dawson walks up to Duncan

DAWSON

I feel like I stepped in on the wrong party

Duncan keeps watching the convertible until it disappears over the
next rise

DUNCAN

(quietly)

Lets go
CUT TO
EXT - BAR - NIGHT

We recognize this place Its where Connor and Duncan shared a last
drink together
Duncan and Joe Dawson now hunch over that same bar staring into their
drinks

DAWSON

I swear the mans a walking ghost
EXT - SIDEWALK - NIGHT

FEET pound pavement

DAWSON (VO) (CONTD)

Whatever it is hes carrying around inside him its like hes dead
already

Glare of streetlights rake across Connors face his eyes fixed
forward as if driven by a sense more powerful than sight

Connor bumps shoulders with a passing PEDESTRIAN
PEDESTRIAN

Eyy man-- watch it

He continues on oblivious

INT - BAR - NIGHT

Duncan turns to Dawson

DUNCAN

There are things you do in this life that damn you for eternity They
cant be changed And they cant be undone You carry these things to
the grave Joe in the hopes that maybe just maybe youll find some
peace there Some relief even if its oblivion

(hollow smile)

But Immortals dont die We just go on reliving our sins Over and
over again

EXT - ANOTHER STREET - LATER
Connor stops Lifts his eyes to the light

A SOLITARY STONE CHURCH
stands before him in a bed of crawling mist It seems eerily out of
place amid the urban blight around it

INT - BAR - NIGHT

Duncan downs the last of his drink shoves off from the bar
Dawson glances warily up at him

DAWSON

DUNCAN

There were two places I figured Connor was likely to go One of

DAWSON

He fishtails around the next corner Recovers
DAWSON (contd)

Ill tell ya this-- if hes going after Kase hes in for a rude
awakening The mans untouchable

DUNCAN

So they tell me

INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - NIGHT

Connor stops before the darkened altar senses BUZZING
THE SHADOWED CRUCIFIX

stirs Arms lift in the darkness

Jacob Kase steps down off the cross lingers in shadow
KASE

I would grant you absolution If I were a better man
He turns and disappears out the back

Connor follows
Right past
KASES POSSE OF IMMORTALS

scattered throughout the pews who simply track him with their eyes
but make no move to follow

WINSTON

the tall Jamaican leans over to Faith

WINSTON

You know were next dont you

Faith lowers the book shes reading-- the Holy Bible Looks up
FAITH

What

WINSTON

Our days are numbered You can see it in Kases eyes
FAITH

Do you believe in a hereafter Winston

WINSTON

All I know is I wont be hereafter Jacob Kase gets through with me
And thats all I care about right now

Faith leans back against the hardback pew closes her
eyes

FAITH

Yeah

CUT TO

EXT - REAR OF CHURCH - NIGHT

Kase strides just beyond the perimeter of the church grounds then
turns back to Connor
Connor draws his sword moves on Kase
KASE

The ancient samurai vowed never to draw blood in anger It defiled
their sense of purpose

(draws his own sword)
Of course theyre also somewhat extinct

He steps fearlessly up to Connor places his neck against Connors
swordblade

just like he did with a certain late Immortal named Carlos
CLOSE ON KASES SWORD

He opens his fingers and lets the sword DROP It clatters useless to
the ground

KASE

Would you slaughter an unarmed man of God again Connor Would that
finally put your soul to rest

low taunting)

Then go ahead Send me home

BLOOD POUNDS with the rage pulsing through Connors veins
KASE (contd)

Whats stopping you Guilt The nagging sense that maybe you more
than I deserve to die

Dawsons car pulls up in the background Duncan jumps
out

KASE (contd)

Or somewhere along the way did you just lose your nerve
Connors sword digs into Kases neck Breaks skin

DUNCAN
(approaching)

Dont do it Connor

CONNOR

(gritted)

Keep back

KASE

(to Duncan)

You heard him No Immortal can interfere with anothers duel
DUNCAN

Hes playing you Step back onto holy ground before its too late--
ase faces back to Connor

KASE

Go ahead-- what better chance than now Take your shot
DUNCAN

Dont listen to him

KASE

KASE (contd)

Tell me-- do they even begin to equal the devastation of an entire
village

BLADE TREMBLES in Connors hands Kase presses his neck even harder
against Connors blade BLOOD trickles down his neck

KASE (contd)
So close Soooo close
Duncan stands by helpless to intervene

KASE (contd)

Look at you Even now youre afraid youll lose Thats your true
fear isnt it

(whispers low seductive)

Oh its not the dying my friend I know that That would be a
blessing Its the thought of giving up your essence to me Making me
even stronger by it

One look in Connors eyes and you know hes right
KASE (contd)

Whats wrong

(almost a purr)

Dont you want to be inside me
Connor slowly LOWERS his sword
and FLICKS Kases discarded sword back up into his hands
ase simply smiles and takes position

Duncan can only look on helplessly as Kase takes the first offensive
driving Connor backward with dazzling -- almost casual-- swordplay

KASE

Ive taken more heads than you can possibly imagine

His sword whistles across Connors face opens a THREE

INCH GASH over his eye

KASE (contd)

Do you really want a taste of all those accumulated quickenings

Connor stumbles backward again blinded by his own dripping blood
nows beyond a shadow of a doubt hes doomed

Duncan knows it too And its killing him to watch
Still Connor wont go down easy

He manages a brief offensive walking Kase backward on his toes

ase puts one hand behind his back fencing-style and goes to work on
Connors torso crosshatching him in blood

Connor lunges wildly Kase parries effortlessly

Kase now opens up a BLINDING BARRAGE on Connor Its like duelling
against lightning so quick and unpredictable are Kases strikes

Constantly off balance Connor still manages to NICK Kase in the
cheek

KASE (contd)
(touches scratch)
Id almost forgotten what that felt like Thank you

He now turns it on full Drives Connor up against a wall and pins him
with his swordtip
His eyes go impossibly cold
KASE

I want you to think back to this moment in the endless nights ahead
And know that every time you close your eyes from now to eternity
Ill be there

(beat)

Ripping apart the ones you care about most

He removes his sword and steps back

KASE (contd)

Its not over Connor MacLeod It will never never be over

He turns and walks back toward the church

Duncan does not step aside to let him pass-- their shoulders bump
KASE (contd)

You on the other hand are on borrowed time

He continues on past the other Immortals who have gathered to watch
the unfolding spectacle

One-by-one they turn and file back into the church behind Kase

Connor stares into Duncans eyes as if wanting to say something
Cant

Instead he turns and starts limping out across the empty lot
Feeling the presence of another Immortal Duncan slowly looks over at
FAITH

who stands at a distance Watching him

As their eyes meet she too turns and melts back into the
surrounding blackness

TRANSITION TO

EXT - DUBLIN ROWHOUSE (17TH CENTURY) - DAY
A BEARDED BRAWLER
CRASHES DOWN onto a wooden table He takes the table cloth with him as
he TUMBLES head over heels onto the floor in a cascade of soda bread

and cabbage

Miraculously (unless youre an Irishman) he spills not one drop of
precious Guinness which he hoists in a cheery salute to

THE BRIDE AND GROOM
who sit laughing in the eye of an Irish hurricane DUNCAN MACLEOD and
CATHERINE MARY (KATE) DEVANEY-- aka Faith-- are a stunning couple

that inspire joyful madness

Things have progressed nicely since their chance encounter at the toll
crossing

BRAWLER
Lets have at it

They kiss to a CHORUS of BOOS So this time they REALLY KISS Crowd
goes wild

AROUND THEM
REVELERS DANCE and FIGHT with equal abandon making it almost

impossible to tell the difference But they stop like clockwork for
every new toast and testimonial
THE BEARDED BRAWLER

spears his mug into the air like a royal scepter

BRAWLER

Happy is the bride that sees the sun Sorry the corpse that sees the
rain

CLOSE ON BEER MUG
framed in a perfect BEAM of SUNLIGHT streaming through an open window
FOLLOW THE SUNBEAM TO

KATE who smiles back with her own inner radiance Bedecked in flowers
her brown hair sweets low over white lace shoulders and cream skin
She leans over RAUCOUS CHEERS and kisses Duncan provoking a new RIOT
of and UPRAISED GLASSES

THE PIPERS
resplendent in their Celtic kilts launch into the Highland Fling
Kate is instantly YANKED up onto her feet and into a ROUSING JIG

Before Duncan can protest hes HOISTED from his seat and FLUNG onto
the dance floor

Duncan and Kate link arms goaded on by a circle of shouting
stumbling CLAPPERS

With each new upshift in tempo they spin faster and faster until
theyre hanging on for dear life

SIGHT AND SOUND

gradually blur into a queasy sense of vertigo But for Duncan its
not just the headstrong mix of drink and passion

Its the BUZZ of another Immortal

He spins to a stop as his eyes come to rest on
CONNOR MACLEOD

who enters the room on a wave of silence

Duncan breaks away from Kate crosses over to Connor and wraps him in
a bear hug

DUNCAN
About time I was beginning to wonder
CONNOR

I was on a junk in the South China Sea when I got your notice 12
hours ago

DUNCAN
How

CONNOR
Dont ask

Kate spins by on the arm of a new partner
KATE

Youre next Connor MacLeod

CONNOR

That better be no idle threat

Duncan watches Kate with a rapturous smile
DUNCAN

Well I finally did it

CONNOR

So it would appear

DUNCAN

What do you think of her

CONNOR

You know thats not an easy answer

The edge in his voice is not lost on Duncan
CONNOR (contd)

Outside

EXT - PORCH - NIGHT

Connor stands with Duncan at the railing staring out into the
encroaching night

CONNOR
You know shes like us
DUNCAN

Yes I sensed it the day we met her
CONNOR

So you know that like us her immortality can only be triggered by
the shock of a violent death

Duncan looks off as if purging the thought from his head
CONNOR (contd)

Its what makes warriors of us all Duncan Good or bad there seems a
purpose to it

DUNCAN

Yes And without such a death shell simply grow old and die like any
other Is that what you dragged me out here to tell me

Connor removes a uniquely-braided GOLDEN ROPE from his vest pocket

It catches the candlelight with the glint of a thousand silken threads
as he runs it lightly over his fingertips

CONNOR

Many years after I was married I came home to find Heather sitting on
a stool in the kitchen with a knife in one hand and her hair in
the other

FLASH TO

HEATHER early-forties her hair shorn to the scalp She looks up at
Connor with red-rimmed eyes and a bitter smile

CONNOR (contd)

At first I was scared Scared that shed gone mad And then angry as
if shed somehow meant to hurt me by it

BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN

CONNOR (contd)

When I asked her why shed done such a thing to herself her answer
cut me to the quick She said it was the one part of her that would
not age It would forever remain the same as when I first fell in love

with her

FLASH TO
CONNOR burying Heather in a simple grave overlooking their home Tears
streak his face He sinks to his knees in unspeakable anguish

CONNOR (contd)

And thats how she wanted me to remember her

BACK TO CONNOR AND DUNCAN

Connor closes his fingers around the braid Squeezes
CONNOR (contd)

Its all I have now

DUNCAN

I love Kate Ill hold on to her as long as I can Thats all I can
do

Kate can be seen through the window behind them exchanging dance
partners with dizzying abandon

CONNOR
If thats your intent so be it

Duncan swings over the rail and hops off the porch Takes to the
ground in long angry strides

EXT - COBBLED STREET - NIGHT

Conner walks double time to catch up with him
DUNCAN

Why are you telling me this

CONNOR

Because I once loved a woman more than life itself And I watched her
die Unlike you I had no other choice

DUNCAN
And I have a choice What would you have me tell her

CONNOR
Id tell her nothing She wouldnt believe you They never do when it
involves themselves

DUNCAN
Then I can do nothing
CONNOR

Shes in the flower of her youth Enjoy the moment and let it pass If
you think you can

Duncan suddenly grabs Connors shoulder spins him around
DUNCAN

Youd have me kill her Is that it Is that what you came all this
way to tell me on my WEDDING NIGHT

CONNOR

Id have you do what your heart-- and our conscience-- demand
Duncan settles Searches his eyes

DUNCAN

And if it were you in my place

Connor ponders Then shakes his head

CONNOR

I thank God I never had the choice

He listens to the faint strains of music and laughter carried on the
rising WIND

CONNOR (contd)
Tell Catherine Im sorry I couldnt stay longer

He clasps Duncan by the forearm Then turns and continues n down the
cobbled lane leading from the wedding party

TRANSITION BACK TO

INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT
Duncan lies sleepless in a nouveau-stark hotel room somewhere in the
bowels of Manhattan

A half-empty bottle of Glenmorangie is there for company

The door CREAKS OPEN casting a single ribbon of light across the
room

It WIDENS to REVEAL THE SILHOUETTE OF A WOMAN
Duncan closes his eyes Feigns sleep

She pads silently inside Pulls the door closed
Duncan remains still breathing heavily

The woman steals slowly up to the bedside Pauses as if quietly
studying Duncan--

--then swings her leg up and straddles him

Even in the murky halflight he can still make out the familiar
painted eyes framed by a tangle of bleached hair

She says nothing her expression lost under a veil of darkness Only
her rapid breathing betrays her tension

nstead she suddenly leans forward and KISSES HIM
Passionately

Duncan responds in kind AS if powerless to do anything
else

LIGHTNING stitches the sky outside as--

fq

They embrace

Bodies entwine with an urgency that builds with the STORM
raging outside

ON THE NEXT THUNDERCRACK

TRANSITION TO

EXT - EMPTY FIELD (DUBLIN) - NIGHT
ANGRY SHEETS OF RAIN rake the countryside as Duncan slogs imlessly
through calf-deep mud Still in his wedding arb hes thoroughly
drenched as if hes been wandering this way for hours

INT - ROWHOUSE - NIGHT

The last of the guests have gone or passed out beneath toppled kegs of
ale

Only Kate remains upright her face etched with sober dread as
DUNCAN

appears in the doorway rivulets of water pouring off his
shoulders and brow

For a while they just stare at one another each lost to his own sense
of foreboding

Kate is the first to speak Despite her stoic veneer her voice comes
out small and terrified

KATE
If this is wrong Duncan tell me now

Saying nothing Duncan slowly crosses the floor and takes her hands in
his own

INT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

CANDLES flicker in the storm-fed drafts that whistle through closed
windows

Kate lays Duncans rainsoaked clothing across a nightstand then turns
regarding him naked for the very first time

Duncan reaches out to touch her She trembles

Gently as if unwrapping an object of unimaginable fragility Duncan
removes her clothing down to a simple floating chemise

Then guides her down onto a canopied bed encircled by a hundred fresh-
cut wildflowers

HANDS

clasp fingers dig into skin
Whatever refinements Kate displayed in public are now
abandoned

She arches up under Duncan puts her lips to his ear
KATE

Ill love you forever

On an OMINOUS THUNDERCLAP--

TRANSITION BACK TO

INT - SOHO HOTEL - NIGHT

Were back in the present Little has changed but the
sheets

And the fury of their lovemaking

happily

Each new THUNDERCRACK highlights a different aspect of their hunger--
their wet glistening bodies STROBING FASTER AND FASTER until the act
itself becomes abstracted from any sense of time or place

FLASH FRAMES
stutter inside the lightning

SILKEN HAIR

coursing over cream-colored breasts and a simple pewter cross

EYES

similar in shape and color that shift from painted to plain

FINGERNAILS
that toggle between neo-goth BLACK and natural pink

FAITH

throws back her head biting back the shudders of release

and sinks down into the bed with a drawn sigh

INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT
A SHADOW darkens Kate as she sleeps It lingers there deadly still
DUNCAN
stands over her gripped by indecision

The fateful choice tears at him even as he holds a DAGGER over her
gently-rising chest

His hand TREMBLES

DUNCAN

(softly)

Forgive me

KATES EYES

SNAP OPEN as the DAGGER PLUNGES INTO HER HEART

For an instant their eves meet And in that single shattering moment
Duncan knows he chose wrong

Its not just terror that passes through Kates eyes Its the
incomprehensible pain of betrayal

Kate gasps once jerks and settles Lies there dead blood pooling
across her nightgown

Duncan stares down at her body numb

DUNCAN

mM sorry

On that look we TRANSITION BACK TO

NT - HOTEL - NIGHT

The pain imprints on Duncan as if hes still clutching the knife

DUNCAN

m sorry

Whatever passion stirred Faith moments before is gone without a trace
Her eyes are as cold and empty as the dead Kate
FAITH

You had no right

DUNCAN

I was doing it for you For us

FLASH TO

INT - DUBLIN BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kate CONVULSES BACK TO LIFE eyes wild insane

Duncan reaches out to her which only sends her reeling further into
panic delirium She swats at him punching flailing

DUNCAN
Now youre an immortal Like me It was the only way
Words fall on deaf ears

She wrenches out of his grip Stumbles for the door drenched in her
own blood

Leaves Duncan standing mindblown in her wake
EXT - DUBLIN STREETS - NIGHT

Kate flees through wet empty streets-- barefoot nightgown ripped and
bloody face contorted like a madwoman Breath comes in ragged
whimpering gasps

She trips falls Comes up running
BACK TO PRESENT

Faith climbs off the bed throws on Duncans shirt whirls back tears
streaking her face like warpaint

FAITH
You wanted this I never asked for eternity You forced it on me
(screams)

IT WAS MY DECISION NOT YOURS
DUNCAN
Would you have really understood
FAITH

Understood Which part The part about never having children Or the
endless numbing sameness of it all

(bitter laugh)

Or maybe you mean the part where you wake up one day and realize
youre nothing but a whore racking up faceless affairs because whole
lifetimes tick by so fast they dont even count anymore

She wraps her arms around herself as if to stem the escaping demons
Duncan remains silent taking it all in

FAITH (contd)

Heres the kicker Duncan I came here for one reason and one reason
only To see if I could feel again Anything

She walks out leaving the door hanging wide in her wake

INT - HALLWAY

Faith reaches for the stairwell door as--

--DUNCANS ARM LANCES OUT holding it shut

DUNCAN

(leaning in)

Im watching my best friend driven insane by something that happened
four centuries ago And theres nothing I can do to stop it Because
those people are dead and nobody can bring them back

Faith struggles to open the door Duncan holds firm

DUNCAN (contd)

But Im lucky You know why

FAITH

Let go
DUNCAN

Im lucky because my crime can still be forgiven
FAITH

LET GO

DUNCAN

As long as youre still alive theres at least the chance It could
take years Centuries even It may never happen

Faith is now PUSHING FURIOUSLY on the door
DUNCAN (contd)

But at least I can still carry the hope inside me Thats one blessing
of immortality Theres always tomorrow

He lets go of the door and steps back

DUNCAN (contd)

Even for you

Faith shoves her way past him and disappears into the stairwell

slowly through an elaborate kata

The precision of his movement belies the chaos inside him

He windmills the katana over his head faster and faster until he
suddenly RELEASES IT--

THE SWORD
PINWHEELS through the night sky arcing out across the open space
between buildings

Duncan watches its long lofting trajectory

then takes off RUNNING He reaches the edge of the rooftop and
LEAPS

Legs cycling through empty air he traces a matching arc directly
under the far-flung sword

Like a long-jumper stretching for that last inch of sand Duncan
HYPER-EXTENDS for the next rooftop

Except me And that bugs the shit out of you doesnt it
KASE
Not really
AT THE NEXT TURN
its clear hell never make it hes going too fast Kase only smiles

Releasing the wheel he stands in his seat lifts his arms above his
head and SHOUTS in exultation as--

--the car EXPLODES into the wall

Its all over in a breath Accordioned metal drooling radiator and
Faith slumped over the dash

Kase lies sprawled and battered on the pavement thrown some distance
from the wreckage Hes clearly taken the worst of the impact

FAITH

stirs and slowly wrenches herself free of the smoking mangle of steel
and plastic

She reaches back and pulls Kases sword free of the wreckage

With single-minded determination she limps over to Kases body face-
up in his own pooling blood

A disbelieving PEDESTRIAN pauses in shock
Faith gives her a twisted smile
FAITH
Dont mind us

Pedestrian SCURRIES OFF as Faith lifts the sword over her head and
brings it WHISTLING DOWN across Kases neck

With inhuman reflexes Kase awakens and catches her wrist in the same
heartbeat

Eyes narrow

KASE

Does this mean its over
DISSOLVE TO

EXT - KASES CHURCH - DAY

ase steps up to the back entrance alone
THE DOOR hangs slightly ajar which clearly disturbs him
INT - CHURCH SANCTUARY - DAY

Kase enters the main room to find Calvin and Sarge asleep on their
pews He kicks the first pew awakens both with a start

KASE

Who left the back door open
CALVIN

Huh

Kase looks to Sarge

SARGE

I dunno

KASE

Wheres Cracker Bob He was supposed to be watching the back
Calvin and Sarge both shrug
KASE (contd)
(sotto)
Infants
He whirls stalks out
INT - SACRISTY
Kase enters his dark cluttered office SLAMMING the door behind him
FLICKS ON THE LIGHT
and stops cold
A SWORD
JUTS from a small wooden table
right through CRACKER BOB who lies skewered to the tabletop
WRAPPED AROUND THE SWORDHILT
is Caiolin MacLeodâ€˜s unique silver-and-wood CRUCIFIX
The message is not lost on Kase
BOBS EYES

suddenly flutter open First thing he sees is that sword hilt sticking
rudely out of his own chest

CRACKER BOB

Ah-- Ahhh-- AHHHHHHH

KASE

Shut up

He reaches forward and JERKS the sword out of Bob and with it
A SINGLE SCRAP OF PAPER

impaled on the blade
It bears just one word scrawled in Bobs plentiful blood
GLENFINNAN

Bob sits up on the table wild-eyed as Kase calmly opens his fingers
and lets the paper slide from his fingers

CUT TO
EXT - LITTLE ITALY ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

Glitter lights and milling tourists Row upon row of gimmicky Italian
restaurants

INT - ITALIAN RESTAURANT PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

Jacob Kase and his acolytes dine at a long table set against a gaudy
backdrop of faux Roman ruins babbling fountains and plastic holly

It all imparts a whiff of Last Supper pomp to the proceeding

Which is not lost on the other Immortals who glance around warily
while eating as suspicious of each other as they are of Kase

Nor does anyone miss the fact that there are no windows in this
particular room

CLOSE ON WINSTON
He stares into his pasta beading sweat
BENEATH THE TABLE

his fingers curl around the cold steel of a 38 SPECIAL wedged between
his knees He inches the gun upward toward the table rim as

ase suddenly stands up in the center

KASE

A toast

All heads turn

Gun freezes in Winstons lap just hidden from view
KASE (contd)

I see tonight as a celebration of the spirit
(raises his glass)
Heres to all of you who continue to
stand by me
(smiles at Winston)
even those who might waver at times
Winston stiffens fears that Kase is on to him
And when Calvin averts his gaze he knows
Still he raises his glass As do the others
KASE (contd)
You are my flock You nourish my soul
Its now or never for Winston His moment of truth
ases eyes slowly drift over to meet his
SLOW MOTION
ase tips back his glass and drinks eyes locked on Winston

Winston responds in kind gulping down his wine as he slips the gun
back into his pocket

He shoves off from the table
WINSTON

Excuse me

KASE

Where you going

WINSTON

Toilet

KASE

Sit sit Im not through with my toast yet
WINSTON

Cant wait

He angles for the door

KASE

Im almost finished Sit

Winston reaches for the doorknob Locked

He swivels back Sees death in Jacob Kases eyes His death

KASE (contd)

Itll all be over in a few more seconds

A cold spike of fear shoots through every single one of them
as Kase continues

KASE (contd)

Youâ€˜ve all been a part of a great quest A four hundred year quest for
justice

He lifts up an exquisitely-crafted sword
KASE (contd)

And here my friends is the instrument of that justice Its called
the Colichmarde Finest sword known to man

The blade WHISTLES upright
KASE (contd)

Blessed by Popes and baptized in blood I only break it out for
special occasions

He kisses the perfect cross formed by the juncture of blade and
quillons

KASE (contd)
It sings like an angel Just listen

Winston jerks for his gun
In a SUDDEN BLUR of STEEL and BLOOD Kase beheads Winston and
dispatches the next two of his stunned acolytes with blinding
efficiency

TONGUES OF LIQUID ENERGY coil up and around Kases body But he keeps
right on coming

The others scatter like roaches

ESSENCE PULSES off walls and ceiling SHATTERING STATUARY HURLING
FURNITURE

before MERGING with the WALKING INFERNO that is now Jacob Kase

His sword BLAZES through the remaining victims trailing STREAKS OF
BLUE FIRE

One after another they drop headless to the concrete
triggering

A FULL-ON MULTIPLE-QUICKENING

THE NEXT WAVE OF ESSENCE

SLAMS into Kase front on His knees BUCKLE

ANOTHER

Hits him BROADSIDE buffeting him one way as

YET ANOTHER

POUNDS him from the opposite- side rocking him back center and

IMMOBILIZING HIM inside an omni-directional CRUSH of LIGHT AND SOUND
that WHITES OUT THE FRAME

DISSOLVE TO
EXT - SCOTTISH HIGHLANDS - DAY

A THICK CLINGING FOG enshrouds the rocky highlands Somewhere along
the invisible coastline below a foghorn MOANS

The skeletal remains of an ancient Gaelic CASTLE loom spectral gray
above

JACOB KASE
who stands before an ANCIENT CELTIC MONOLITH (familiar from
Glenfinnans town square) revelling in the changeless land of his
birth

KASE

(calling out)

Where else could stir the blood of a Scotsman too long of this earth
and too far from home

Kase picks his way across the uneven ground unable to see beyond the
reach of his own arm

KASE (contd)
(filling his lungs)

I can nae get enough of it

He draws his sword extends it outward until the tip
disappears from sight

A LOW SCRAPING OF METAL ON STONE taunts him from
somewhere out there in the slow-drifting whiteness
Kases sword TWITCHES toward the SOUND

Just the FAINTEST OUTLINE of a FIGURE COALESCES BRIEFLY inside the
fog

KASE

Ah whats this Hamlets ghost

The FIGURE melts back into silent nothingness
KASE (contd)

Im afraid even the cloak of fog wont help you overcome a sizeable
disadvantage

A DIFFERENT SCRAPING SOUND
spins him around to see

ANOTHER GHOSTLY FIGURE
looming over him from a narrow stone outcropping

Kase masks a slight tinge of concern

KASE (contd)

Its always good to see two fellow clansmen banded together in a
common cause But I hope you havent sunk to the level of a
simultaneous ambush

Once again the figure steps backward into the enveloping

fog Disappears

Slightly unnerved Kase jerks around No sign of anyone Just that
infernal mist

A SOFT SCRAPING of SWORD against ROCK swivels him back around to his
original position

CLOSE ON KASE
His nerves are starting to shred

He turns several full rotations craning for a glimpse of his
tormentors

And then he sees it

AN APPARITION WIELDING A SWORD

Kase LUNGES for it And this time it doesnt retreat
Swords CLANG in thunderous overture as

TWO SPECTRES IN THE FOG

battle for position on tenuous footing

KASE drives his adversary backward into a BLUNTED STONE WALL leaving
him no avenue of escape

Their swords LOCK UP and Kase suddenly finds himself FACE TO FACE
WITH--

DUNCAN MACLEOD

You can sense Kases bitter disappointment
KASE

Not at all who Id hoped for

CLOSE ON DUNCANS EYES

as they flick to a point iust behind Kases head

CLOSE ON KASES EYES

as he realizes hes been had
He SWINGS FULLY AROUND TO FACE CONNOR--
--and sees that NOBODYS THERE

Too late-- he SWINGS BACK TO DUNCAN-- and IMPALES HIMSELF ON DUNCANS
SWORD

DUNCAN
(through clenched teeth)

Im afraid Connor couldnt be here But dont worry hes with us in
spirit

Still gripping his sword two-fisted Duncan seems to surge with
newfound strength

DUNCAN

He gave himself for this moment And I shant let him down

Duncan SHOVES OFF from Kase and goes to work on him with a VENGEANCE
WHAT KASE SEES

A frightening hallucinitory vision of a DUAL ADVERSARY-- one that
CHANGES back and forth in the flux of swirling mist

As Duncans blade BLURS PAST Kase sees CONNOR With the very next
SWING he sees Duncan again

Then Connor Then Duncan Connor Duncan
Kase rubs his eyes with the back of his hand Shakes it off Cant be

Duncan buffets Kase backward with several dazzling combinations then
goes inside tough and ugly
ase seems suddenly overwhelmed physically and mentally as hes
driven onto his back by sheer relentless overdrive

Duncan SLASHES DOWN for the killing blow which Kase BARELY DEFLECTS

He SLASHES AGAIN And AGAIN Each time Kase barely escapes with his
head intact

Duncan keeps up this relentless barrage hacking down in every
conceivable direction looking for an opening finding none

With each increasingly-leaden DOWNSTROKE Duncan is losing strength
and Kase is regaining his

Kase BATTLES BACK TO HIS FEET deftly siezes the advantage

KASE

(savage smile)

This is not a game won on points Im afraid

He drives Duncan back with an answering exchange that leaves no doubt
of his superior ability

In a single massive THRUST Kase STRIPS Duncans sword and sends him
flying

Duncan lands on his back weaponless

Kase steps up to the katana scoops his toe under it and FLICKS IT
BACK TO DUNCAN

Then waves him back to his feet A cat playing with his prey
Both combatants square off and RESUME

KASE

Thats the beauty of eternity The fun never stops
He THRUSTS-- spiking Duncan clear through the shoulder
Duncan hangs up on the blade unable to move Grimaces

in pain
Setting boot to chest Kase KICKS Duncan off his sword and sends him
spiralling backward

Duncan reaches out to break his fall--
--but theres no ground beneath him

He PLUMMETS OFF a SLANTED CLIFF Bounces at fifty feet then tumbles
clear to the bottom

ase steps up to the edge scowls

A FRESHLY-CUT QUARRY

has been hewn from the hilltop by the massive sword of modern
technology

EARTH MOVING EQUIPMENT several stories tall lines the inner basin
KASE
What have they done to my mountain

He gazes down at DUNCANS BODY sprawled at the base of the cliff Then
starts down after him

EXT - BOTTOM OF QUARRY - DAY
Duncan crawls over to his sword
as Kase picks his way down the steep incline
Duncan spikes his sword into the ground and uses it to climb upright

One look at his battered body and you know this fight is over He just
stands there hunched over his sword grimly waiting for Kase to reach
him and deliver the killing blow

It doesnt take long Kase stops regards him with
contempt

KASE

Dont make it easy I hate that

DUNCAN

Youâ€˜re breaking my heart
KASE

Pick up

Duncan shakes his blood-streaked head
KASE

PICK UP

DUNCAN

any different

and TURNS HIS BACK TO KASE
DUNCAN (contd)

Take your best shot

ase starts TREMBLING WITH RAGE
KASE

MACLEOD

Duncan ignores him keeps walking

ts always been too easy for you Kase

He plucks his sword out of the ground

No reason this time should be

He hobbles off sword hanging limp at his side

About now we should have a pretty good idea what Duncan has in mind

But Kase doesnt have a clue

DUNCANS POV

For a fleeting moment Connor stands before Duncan more

mist than flesh
He opens his arms wide
CONNORS APPARITION

Remember weil old friend
He DISSOLVES AWAY as Kase hoists sword over shoulder

KASE (contd)

MAC-LEOD

and CHARGES

Which is exactly what Duncan expected
USING THE SAME MOVE CONNOR TAUGHT HIM--

--Duncan PIVOTS WITH the THRUST catching Kase completely off guard
and off balance

This time no force of man or nature can keep Duncans sword from
hitting home

He SLICES UPWARD with a ROAR OF DEFIANCE
and FOLLOWS THROUGH
ON KASE

He stands there head miraculously still intact a look of bewildered
relief

Duncan simply POPS his sword butt into Kases face
The head comes easily away from the neck and falls

KASES POV spins END OVER END through the air bounces twice and comes
to a rest SIDEWAYS

And thats how we first see his HEADLESS BODY sprawled across the
ground

KASES SEVERED HEAD

blinks with sudden recognition And now he knows This is the worst
part of losing your head-- those last few seconds of cold lucidity

DUNCAN
opens his arms to
HEAVES UNDERFOOT

WIDE - THE QUARRY
the ULTIMATE OUICKENING as THE EARTH
WALLS
EXPLODE like a circle of VOLCANOES venting into the center

Duncan CLAWS UPWARD on a GROUNDSWELL OF RAW ENERGY as DIRT ROCK ASH
and SMOKE OBLITERATE THE BASIN

The SEISMIC CONVULSIONS GRADUALLY SUBSIDE
The dust settles

And the blighted landscape falls into an unearthly SILENCE blind to
its own buried secrets

HOLD on the trailing wisps of smoke as
THE GROUND SHUDDERS
and DUNCANS KATANA BREAKS THE SURFACE

It PLUNGES UPWARD ONE TWO THREE MORE TIMES pulverizing dirt and
stone

HANDS FOLLOW clawing their up way through the loosely- mounded earth
until DUNCANS HEAD AND SHOULDERS APPEAR

As if the earth itself is giving birth to a new generation of
Immortal

He rolls out onto the ground gasping triumphant Reborn
One inch at a time he slowly rises to his feet

As we KEEP ON RISING up into a FIERY HIGHLAND SUNSET

TILT BACK DOWN TO

EXT - HIGHLANDS ABOVE GLENFINNAN

Duncan stands over a freshly-dug grave Onto the simple stone hes
chisled

HEATHER MACLEOD
BELOVED WIFE OF CONNOR

And beneath it
CONNOR MACLEOD
BELOVED HUSBAND OF HEATHER

Duncans eyes glisten with an unspeakable loss And a comfort in
knowing that his friend has finally found the peace of eternity

DUNCAN

yours is the greater prize my friend Welcome home
LINGER ON DUNCAN as we DISSOLVE SLOWLY TO

EXT - MANHATTAN SKYLINE - DAWN

FAITH stands sentinel-like atop a bluff overlooking the Hudson River
and the insignificant island of Manhattan beyond

Her trademark slashes of facepaint and hair dye have been shed like
molted skin What remains is a serene beauty that defies fashion or
vanity

Her faraway eyes BLINK with a sudden frightening clarity
THE BUZZ sets her reflexes snapping as she SPINS AROUND--
--and CATCHES the COLICHMARDE handle first

DUNCAN

follows strolling toward her with hands loose at his
side

Faith runs her finger down the shimmering blade

FAITH

(considers)

So what am I supposed to do next -- kiss you or take your head
Duncan steps up to her smiling enigmatically

DUNCAN

The choice is yours

FADE OUT
THE END
