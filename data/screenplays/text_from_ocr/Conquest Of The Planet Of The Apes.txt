proprietor from 8S CAPE ) leading CAESAR a young but
full-grown chimpanzee on a leash Cneaar wearing a

There is nothing perfunctory about thiga each persons card

Armande and Caesar are the last in line Armando handa

disapprovingly at Caesar

OFFICER 2
Do you have authorization to dress
him like that

ARMANDO

Armando hands an official-looking document to Officer 2
who scans it glances indifferently at Caesar

OFFICER 2

And the only one ever to have deen
trained as and bareback rider in the
entire history of the circus

ARMANDO
Listen to mé Caesar There can
be only one talking chimpanzee on
earth the child of the two talking
apes Cornelius and Zira who came
to us years ago out of the future
and were brutally murdered for fear
that one very distant day Apes
might dominate the human race

CAESAR
But outside of you no one knows
I even exist

ARMANDO
And we must keep it that way for
the fear remains The mere fact
of your existence would be regarded
as a great threat to mankind When
you realize how apes are treated

He trails off troubled

CAESAR
What were you going to say
ARMANDO
(pause with

effort
The comradeship of the circus where
humans are kind to animalsis
very different from what you are
about to see

SHOPPING CENTER A-17

Thronged not only with HUMANS (Anglos Blacks Orientals)
pursuing their ordinary pleasures but with APES pursuing
their appointed tasks The humans clothes though
expensively cut are austere monochromatic The apes
costumes are variegated (gorillas in red chimpanzees in
green orangutans in tan) -- long-sleeved full-length
robes for the females trousers and chokered-collars

for the males This sex-distinction in dress applies
equally to the Apes children -- some of whom are seen
walking hand in hand with their parents learning to
serve Some Apes carry baskets of clothing others brooms
to sweep the pavement or a mistresss dress hung in
cellophane over one arm and fresh from the cleaners
Humans carry nothing There are no vehicles in the
streets And despite the apes apparent docility they
exude an air of disquiet some move slugglishly openly
sullen Others dart frightened glances at the many

truncheons and electric prodders

No they were immune And ao it
was discovered were simians even
the smallest ones Thatts how it

household pets to replace the ones
they had lost First it was just
the marmosets and tarsier monkeys

Kolp and Hoskyns

CHAIRMAN

(on the video- tape)
We believe that the male and female
Talking Apes Cornelius and Zira
have come to us out of the future
We believe their spoken testimony
that Some two thousand years hence
their descendants will have subjugated
and all but exterminated the human race
from the face of Earth We believe
that under Ape supremacy Earth itself
will finally be destroyed And we
know that the Female Ape is now pregnant
with child If it is possible to alter
the future (and some of our scientists
believe it is it is our duty to do so
The Commission therefore recommends
that the birth of the Female Apes
unborn child should be prevented and
that after its prenatal removal both
the male and the female should be
rendered incapable of begetting or

FOLLOW with

SERIES OF SHOTS ko

VERY QUICK VERY BIG CLOSEUPS of GORILLAS and ORANGUTANS
registering PEAR Their mouths move constantly quivering
salivating their eyes frightened dart this way and tha
and their faces - in their abject terror - grimace and
contort into obscene images

STRANGE METALLIC SOUNDS and SUDDEN INTERMITTENT FLASHES
of HARSH LIGHT rake their faces momentarily blinding them
and adding to their fear so that the incessant gibbering
and grunting increase in volume

We WHIP PAN from one to the other and back again with
hand-held Camera - GBLIQUE ANGLES occasional LENS
DISTORTION and MOOD LIGHTING heighten the nightmarish
quality of this sequence

ZOOMING OUT STILL FURTHER we find that the half-crazed
animals are behind bare cramped into what appeare
(spacewise) a totally inadequate wooden crate or cage -
and an exceedingly unatable cage at that

It WOBBLES and TILTS alarmingly so that ita occupants
losing their balance stumble and bump against one another
slip and fall - in their pathetic efforts to retain
balance their arms flail wildly and dangerously so that
without intended malice they hit one another with numeroui
vicious punches

Thies results in aeveral ugly brawls of short duration

‘but horrible bloodshed is not far away

Those who have fallen trodden upon and kicked aside
clutch and claw at those who are nearest in their efforts
to regain their feet

And as panic mounts SNARLING turns to BITING

SHOOTING THROUGH BARS As the CAGE SWAYS and LUNGES
DOWNWARD TILTING first this way then that - the GORILLAS
end ORANGUTANS are hazy fleeting blurs in the f as the
are tossed first to thig side and then to the other

Through the bars of the cage nothing can be seen except

Jet blackness (the night is truly moonless)

Wow - as the cage continues its plunge earthward - a SIGN

can be glimpsed 411-illuminated and hard to decipher

Then it disappears out of the top of our frame

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE CAGE he

SHOOTING UPWARDS as it descends Its destination is a
TRUCK dimly (and only partially) revealed in the darkness
what 16 apparent though is that the cage will only just
fit into the back of this vehicle

ANOTHER ANGLE 43

ZOOMING THROUGH THE BLACKNESS into a corner at the rear
of the truck - we discover crouched down low Caesar -

looking apprehensively up at
THE CAGE DESCENDING Ay

Its speed size and weight is highly alarming - especially
to Caesar

Just when it seems nothing can save Caesar from being
crushed to death - he decides to make a last-second dash
for it and leap out the back of the truck

But ne has left it too late

Halfway across the truck Caesar realizes he cannot reach

his objective - the bottom of the swiftly descending cege

s now but a few feet above him and Caesar does the only
thing left open to him

He hurls himself to the side pressing himself flat against
tne woodwork

Simultaneously the CAGE falls with a SICKENING THUMP -
its outer edge misses decapitating Caesar by inches

Tne hysterical occupants squeal and gibber and in this
confined space the ruckus is CHILLING

With no waste of time at all the tailgate of the truck is
hoisted into position

Again the CAGE trembles and shakes as the TRUCK atarte
upon its journey

Gradually the grunts squeals and gibbertngs subside -
s the occupants become aware of Caesar - and there is

Something about Caesar which diaturba them

Pressed up against the side of the truck and the cage

Caeser slips his hand through the bars pulle back a bolt
then another entera the cage and rebolts it

At this moment the TRUCK now obviously traveling at speed
(we never see outside and we follow its progresa by the
behavior of the cage) hits a large bump

This throws the “inmates off balance again -- all except
Caesar who of course has had the good sense to hang
onto and bar

Caesars face cannot help - albeit fleetingly - registering
modicum of contempt as he beholds his companions
sprawling grotesquely on the floor

While some Management PERSONNEL know the truth - that
the APES have gone berserk and are breaking out - an
equally large number of KEEPERS and HANDLERS advance

to unlock those cages that still hold captive APES and
they stream out to join thelr boisterous brethren

And while we know that two men can subdue an APE by
shackling andor injection - now the APES so outnumber
their CAPTORS that the fighting odds are at best one-
against-one and at worst one-against-several

FLAMES blaze in the cages the APES cast nightmarish
shadows as they riot - the air ie filled with HUMAN
SHOUTS and APE CRIES

The day of the writing in the
sky when your cities lie buried
under the radioactive rubble and
the sea has become a Dead Sea and
the Land a wasteland from which I
shall lead my people out of their
captivity And we shall build our
own cities where there will be no
place for humans except to serve
our own ends We shall found our
own armiesour own religion

REVERSE DOWN ANGLE 291

SHOOTING from between Caesar and MacDonald into the square
Below them the square explodes in cries of still unsurfeite1
vengeance as Brecks twitching vody finally falls limp

and motionless under the lash The screeching of the

angry Apes grows louder as they lay about them with clubs
and truncheons at the remaining humans in the square

ZOOM IN on the Apes dark demented faces in the glow of
firelight Their eyes gleam manically The sound of their
screaming intensifies growing louder and louder until

4t reaches a PEAKand ends in an ABRUPT BLACKOUT and
SILENCE
