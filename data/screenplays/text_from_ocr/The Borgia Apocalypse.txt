INTRODUCTION

I first wrote about the Borgias as an historical film It was the second historical subject I had
attempted — the first was Michael Collins the film I made for Warner Brothers about the Irish
guerrilla leader and the Irish War of Independence On Michael Collins I experienced the dilemma of
the historical screenplay — the mass of material that has to be encapsulated within a two-hour time
frame So when Dreamworks suggested that I develop a Borgia project as a cable series for
Showtime I saw it as a unique opportunity to write a 40-hour film about power religion and sex in
the Renaissance period It would be as lurid and dramatic as any Jacobean drama but over four
seasons long enough to do justice to the complexity of the times and the family

Halfway through the shooting of the third season I received word that the new regime at Showtime
might not want to continue with the fourth The series was expensive to produce since we always did
our utmost to do justice to the architecture design and costume of the period however free we
allowed ourselves to be with the actual events The ratings were steady if not spectacular but there
was a large network of avid fans who followed the machinations of the family their loves their
losses their tragedies with absolute devotion As a compromise I proposed a two-hour film which
would bring the story of the family to a satisfactory and apocalyptic conclusion For a variety of
reasons mainly cost Showtime decided not to proceed with the two-hour film

I am presenting this screenplay as an ebook to show those fans how the story they love so much would
have concluded Screenplays are not novels not really even plays they are like architectural sketches
for an unconstructed city But they do tell a story through dialogue and one of the great pleasures of
writing The Borgias was the realisation that cable viewers and fans actually care about dialogue ina
way that a cinema audience no longer does This was a totally unexpected blessing to me as a writer
since I could return to the basic pleasure of words and let the characters be defined and refined
through the words they spoke

So here we have the words We don’t have the pictures the costumes the actors but the fans at least
can read how I would have concluded the story And since the most avid fan of the series was myself
I should state that I am available to direct this should Showtime ever change their minds

INT ALPHONSO’S PALACE DAWN
A pair of white-slippered feet walk up the magnificent staircase
A servant girl comes down with a pile of bloodied blankets in her hands

She steps back and bows in confusion

SERVANT GIRL
Holiness

It is the Pope of Rome

INT LUCREZIA’S BEDROOM DAWN

The dead and bloodied body of Alphonso on the bed The Pope enters in the deep background
He looks at the scene shocked He takes Alphonso’s dead wrist in his hand

Then he falls to his knees begins the prayer of Last Rites

ALEXANDER
Requiscat in pacem

And we hear a voice OS

CESARE Back the cart into the stable gates We can’t leave a trace of-

And as he enters with Rufio the Pope raises his head

ALEXANDER
What is this

He gestures to the bed

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
This outrage This crime This unholy mess

CESARE
I can explain Father —
Alexander looks down at the body The blood everywhere The wound

ALEXANDER
No No-one can explain this

Cesare turns to Rufio

CESARE
Leave us —

Alexander stands

ALEXANDER
Are you to become your brother Who in the end could not be trusted with a public whipping

CESARE
Father he assaulted me —

And Alexander hits him open palmed across the face

ALEXANDER
And you what Did him to death Our son in law Under our protection In the palace we provided
for his safety

CESARE
I will clean up this mess father —

ALEXANDER
Oh yes you will Another body will be fished from the Tiber Another drunkard arraigned for some
night- time brawl You will wash this palace clean of blood And you will recall your manservant

CESARE
Micheletto

ALEXANDER
Who alone could be trusted with such matters

CESARE
He doesn’t speak to me Of late

ALEXANDER
Well then Get him to speak to me

INT THE BORGIA VILLA DAWN
Lucrezia in a bath She is being bathed by her mother Vanozza

LUCREZIA
Take me out of here mother

VANOZZA
You would leave me here alone

LUCREZIA
lam afraid of him now The one I love most in the world

VANOZZA
He would never harm a hair on your head

LUCREZIA
No But he would harm others Anyone I come close to is doomed

She begins to cry

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)
Have we become the family from hell mother

VANOZZA
Perhaps Since we were given the keys of Heaven

LUCREZIA
I need to hide Until I gather my thoughts again My spirits You must know a nunnery That can hide a
troubled soul

VANOZZA
There are many And there is only one way to get you safely there

INT SHABBY ROOM PAPAL BARRACKS DAY
The body of Alphonso laid out on a wooden trestle Rufio is there with two rough henchmen

Cesare enters

CESARE
He was a drunkard you understand

RUFIO
We do my Lord
Cesare pulls a knife

CESARE
And an incompetent brawler

He stabs the body of the dead Alphonso

CESARE (CONT’D)
Ina fight over a tavern whore —

He stabs the body many times

CESARE (CONT’D)
They stabbed him like a wine bag-

He stabs it one last time

CESARE (CONT’D)
Till he could bleed no more

He turns

CESARE (CONT’D)
Now dump him in the Tiber —

EXT TIBER NIGHT
Rufio slips in the body of Alphonso

INT BORGIA VILLA GARDENS NIGHT

Lucrezia there dressed in a nun’s costume

Vanozza enters through the back door and a familiar figure comes behind her
Micheletto

MICHELETTO
I would not have taken this summons from anyone but you

LUCREZIA
And this is true mother

VANOZZA
On your child’s life it is
The boy now is led into the gardens

MICHELETTO
May I

When Lucrezia nods he takes him in his arms

MICHELETTO (CONT’D)
And you will tell me where we are headed

VANOZZA
A nunnery south of here

Micheletto tweaks the child’s cheek

MICHELETTO
This boy Among nuns

VANOZZA
No Giovanni will stay with me

EXT NUNNERY DAY
A convent situated amongst rolling hills

Micheletto leads Lucrezia towards it

LUCREZIA
You will stay with us

MICHELETTO
It is a nunnery my lady I cannot

LUCREZIA
But I will be safe here

MICHELETTO
No word of where you are shall pass my lips

LUCREZIA
Even if my brother demands it

MICHELETTO
I have not seen your brother For months now
LUCREZIA
But my father has summoned you no And when the Pope summons even you must attend

INT CONFESSIONAL NIGHT
The Pope sitting alone in his confessional A figure slips in on the other side of the booth
Micheletto

MICHELETTO
I cannot beg for forgiveness Holiness —

ALEXANDER
Why not

MICHELETTO
Because my sins are numberless And you are asking me to resume this life of crime

ALEXANDER
I am asking you to serve as manservant to the Gonfaliere of the Pope of Rome

MICHELETTO
I killed one dear to me in your son’s service It left me with a wound that is hard to heal

ALEXANDER
Pray to God then to salve that wound And put yourself in His service once more

MICHELETTO
God does not speak to me of late If He has ever

ALEXANDER
He hears the pleas of all Micheletto Even one who must serve Him in the shadows like you

MICHELETTO
Ah So the knife and the garotte are part of God’s plan

ALEXANDER
We rule God’s kingdom for Him Micheletto His enemies wield those weapons And sometimes so
must we

MICHELETTO
I will not be serving God Holiness I will be serving your son Cesare Borgia

ALEXANDER
And he needs you He misses you
On Micheletto’s face He misses Cesare as well

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
He is weaker in your absence

INT VATICAN PALACE DAY

The French ambassador before the Pope in full ceremonial mode Cesare stands behind the Pope
as a kind of consigliere

FRENCH AMBASSADOR
King Louis of France is already on his way Your Holiness

ALEXANDER
More French armies This is all that Rome needs

FRENCH AMBASSADOR
He comes in peace as your Holiness well knows He would swear eternal loyalty to Rome to God
and his Pope And he would discuss with you the troubled issue of Naples

ALEXANDER
Are the French slow learners Did the last invasion of Naples teach them nothing

CESARE
Father —

ALEXANDER
Oh of course We have a grander design here We restructure Italy between us Is that the game

FRENCH AMBASSADOR
I am not party to the king’s deeper intent —

ALEXANDER
A pity We enjoy such games And have proven rather adept at them in the past —

FRENCH AMBASSADOR
In fact Your Holiness I must now say a goodbye of kinds I must relinquish my post

ALEXANDER
Your name again

FRENCH AMBASSADOR
Archbishop D’ Ambroise ambassador to the French King
ALEXANDER
Of course You are to join us here As cardinal From the frying pan into the fire And your successor

FRENCH AMBASSADOR
I have not been graced with his name Your Holiness —

INT CESARE’S QUARTERS DAY

Cesare in a bath being attended by some man or woman servant His father stands in the
background

ALEXANDER
So Another Neapolitan invasion This time with our compliance

CESARE
We must ride the dragon of events father

ALEXANDER
The dragon of events Does he breathe fire The Spanish will be breathing fire when they get wind of
it

A figure appears behind the Pope Micheletto Cesare doesn’t know he is there

The Pope holds a hand up to make sure Micheletto keeps quiet

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
Though if we offered to divide the kingdom

CESARE
Naples Ruled by Spain and France

ALEXANDER
Stranger alliances have happened And it would keep them off our backs Occupied so to speak in
the Neapolitan swamp

The Pope turns and puts a finger to his lips He tiptoes out leaving Micheletto there looking at
Cesare’s broad back

Cesare keeps the conversation going

CESARE
It would be a sweet revenge would it not Their king deposed Or can we hope for his hanging

MICHELETTO
We can hope
Cesare turns

MICHELETTO (CONT’D)
You see I know him of old

Micheletto gives a half smile

MICHELETTO (CONT’D)
As I know you

CESARE
You would surprise me my friend Naked like this

He stands out of the bath

CESARE (CONT’D)
Then you must embrace me

Micheletto walks forwards and embraces him

CESARE (CONT’D)
What brought you back

MICHELETTO
Your father The game

CESARE
You have been away too long

INT CHAPEL NUNNERY DAY
Lucrezia and Pia a young demure nun are scrubbing the floor in the chapel

PIA
Take care between the cracks sister —

She looks at Lucrezia

LUCREZIA
I told you have not yet taken vows

PIA
Yet everyone has a name A name they were born with one they adopt
LUCREZIA
I shall become sister Angela

PIA
Good I can call you that

LUCREZIA
The Reverend Mother examines between the tiles then

PIA
Yes With her fingernail And any dirt will be punished-

LUCREZIA
With a whipping

PIA
She does not whip but her words are worse than any lash

And Lucrezia scrubs fiercely

LUCREZIA
My crack then shall be cleaner than yours - ever was —

Pia smiles nervously And we do not know if she gets the pun

INT CASTEL ST ANGELO DAY

Catherina Sforza asleep on her plain bed She looks up in amazement at something out of shot
BY THE BARS OF HER PRISON —

A white-gloved hand stretches in with a ring inviting a kiss

CATHERINA
You will have to have my legs broken Holiness If you want to see me kneel

ALEXANDER
A kiss might suffice

CATHERINA
A kiss

ALEXANDER
Rather than a genuflection
We see Alexander now in the flickering torchlight

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
Your legendary beauty is fading in here It is starved of daylight It pains us to see such a wonder be
so reduced

CATHERINA
Send me home then

ALEXANDER
Without a formal surrender Without a pledge of eternal service to the Pope of Rome

CATHERINA
Without me kneeling

ALEXANDER
That is impossible I am afraid

CATHERINA
Not only must I be defeated I must be seen to be defeated

ALEXANDER
And the whole world must see it

CATHERINA
But the whole world knows Your Holiness My lands have been seized my castle ravished my
body

ALEXANDER
Your body ravished By whom

CATHERINA
Well your son had his way with it some time ago But then I also took my pleasures on his

ALEXANDER
So he confessed

CATHERINA
To you

She smiles

CATHERINA (CONT’D)
How intimate
ALEXANDER
We share most things

And she is beginning to see an opening

CATHERINA
So I have heard

She walks closer to the bars

CATHERINA (CONT’D)
Might I suggest Holiness

ALEXANDER
Yes

CATHERINA
You have tried brute force You have tried chains prison walls and none have made me kneel to you
What you have not yet tried is

She brings her lips close to the bars

CATHERINA (CONT’D)
Kindness

ALEXANDER
Kindness

CATHERINA
A soft word A gentle touch can often achieve what the whip and the rack cannot

ALEXANDER
Ah

He touches her lips with his hand

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
We could unlock that indomitable heart with just a word or two

CATHERINA
Perhaps

ALEXANDER
Well let us put it to the test Perhaps you could join us for supper some days hence
CATHERINA
Still in chains

ALEXANDER
And if words can melt you we will do our best to find them

EXT BALCONY VATICAN DAY
A balcony overlooking the gardens Micheletto and Cesare

CESARE
So my father’s pleas carry more weight than mine

MICHELETTO
It was time And he made me realise I am weaker without you As are you without me

CESARE
Did you explain your absence to him

MICHELETTO
You had me kill one I loved

CESARE
Thad you kill one that played with you And me

MICHELETTO
Stillit scared me

CESARE
Where

Micheletto takes Cesare’s hand and places it on his heart

MICHELETTO
Here

CESARE
So You have a heart

MICHELETTO
Not anymore

CESARE
Ah so you are fit for service once again
Micheletto glances down into the gardens where we can see Rufio waiting

MICHELETTO
Is there still room for me

CESARE
For one I trust such as you Of course

MICHELETTO
And you trust him

Cesare smiles

CESARE
So far

MICHELETTO
You shouldn’t

CESARE
Prove it to me then Why I shouldn’t And we will be as one once more

Cesare embraces him

CESARE (CONT’D)
Come Meet your other

MICHELETTO
Must I

CESARE
Yes Things have changed here Greatly

INT CELL IN NUNNERY NIGHT
Pia dressing for bed As she takes off her bonnet we see her hair is shorn
Lucrezia takes off her bonnet but keeps white wimple on underneath

PIA
You sleep with your wimple —

LUCREZIA
Yes As I did last night And the night before that —
PIA
Does the Reverend Mother know

LUCREZIA
Not unless you tell her

PIA
There are rules here that govern every minute of our day And we are sworn to keep them —

LUCREZIA
Well can you keep a secret then

Pia stares at her

PIA

Lucrezia comes close to her Almost lip to lip

LUCREZIA
Promise

PIA
I shouldn’t but I do

LUCREZIA
I obey no rules

She takes off her wimple and her beautiful hair spreads down around her shoulders
Pia gasps As if she has never seen such beauty

PIA
You are not a nun Not even a novitiate

Lucrezia smiles

LUCREZIA
I am serving penance

PIA
What penance

LUCREZIA
The penance of Sappho
PIA
Sappho

LUCREZIA
Yes She made the mistake of loving a woman

PIA
A woman

LUCREZIA
A long time ago On the island of Lesbos

Lucrezia lies down on her hard bed
LUCREZIA (CONT’D)
But when my penance is done my father has promised To take me back To barter me in marriage

like any other child bearing beast of burden

PIA
I would rather be a nun sister Angela

LUCREZIA
And some nights sister Pia so would I

CESARE
And you
Micheletto slowly shakes his head Rufio holds out his hand

RUFIO
You are a legend

MICHELETTO
Ah Where

RUFIO
Throughout the whole of Italy Wherever men fight

Micheletto shakes Rufio’s hand

MICHELETTO
You were Catherina Sforza’s man

RUFIO
Iwas

MICHELETTO
And you can change allegiance so easily From Florence to Rome

RUFIO
She is the past He is the future

Micheletto looks from Cesare to Rufio

MICHELETTO
And long may he remain so

INT CASTEL ST ANGELO DAY

CATHERINA
My confinement is improving

ADRIANA
Is it

CATHERINA
It must be if they allow you to wash my hair

She takes a dead louse from the water
CATHERINA (CONT’D)
But it will never end

ADRIANA
They cannot keep you here forever

CATHERINA
Oh yes they can And will Among rats and lice

She takes Adriana’s hand in hers
CATHERINA (CONT’D)
The Pope sent you did he not As a peace offering of kinds

ADRIANA
I was told to do whatever would make you comfortable

CATHERINA
And give His Holiness a message from me then will you

ADRIANA
He so rarely speaks to me

CATHERINA
But I am sure you can find a way

She brings the hand to her cheek

CATHERINA (CONT’D)
Tell him when he asks after my comforts that I would happily dine with him But only if I can make
myself presentable

ADRIANA
Presentable

CATHERINA
Hair washed and curled Face and lips with all of the necessary unguents I would be beautiful again
if only for one night For him

INT VATICAN GARDENS DAY

Adriana hurries past the Pope eyes downcast

ALEXANDER
You girl —
ADRIANA

How is our charge

When Adriana is afraid to answer he interjects

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
Catherina Sforza

ADRIANA
She is sad Your Holiness

ALEXANDER
Of course Wouldn’t you be In chains

ADRIANA
But she told me she would happily dine with you If she could make herself presentable

ALEXANDER
Indeed Could this tigress at last be in the process of being tamed

He considers

ADRIANA
She would be beautiful again if only for one night for you

ALEXANDER
Touching indeed

ADRIANA
Have I then your Holiness’ permission to supply her with all of the necessary comforts

ALEXANDER
You have indeed Whatever she needs

INT CELL IN NUNNERY NIGHT

Pia asleep in bed Then her innocent shorn head suddenly shivers as if from a nightmare She sits
bolt upwards

Lucrezia wakes
LUCREZIA
What is it

PIA
I cannot keep your secret

LUCREZIA
Why not

PIA
I dreamt of the fires of hell They burnt my clothes What is left of my hair I have sworn to hide no
detail of our lives from our Reverend Mother I cannot swear a lie

LUCREZIA
Can I let you in ona secret Pia

PIA
What

LUCREZIA
She already knows

PIA
She does

LUCREZIA
My father who would have me marry some fat merchant for some bagful of coins is a benefactor of
this place

Pia lays her head back down

PIA
And now I cannot sleep

LUCREZIA
You can smell the sulphur Of the fires of hell

PIA
And I miss my mother

LUCREZIA
Come here

PIA
Over to you

INT CASTEL ST ANGELO DAY
Catherina Sforza writes out the equivalent of a shopping list
CATHERINA
A bleach for the hair For the face a mixture of mercury and vermillion Though if my skin were any
paler it would probably fade away And for the lips a salve
that a former servant of mine knows of

She scribbles a note

CATHERINA (CONT’D)
But this note is for him alone For his eyes only

Adriana looks at the note

ADRIANA
Rufio

Who wrote this note

ADRIANA
The lady Catherina She dines with the Pope tomorrow She would look her best

RUFIO
One last time perhaps

He looks at her

RUFIO (CONT’D)
And who else knows of this request

ADRIANA
No-one my Lord

RUFIO
It is unusual to say the least

ADRIANA
She wanted a salve

RUFIO
A lip-balm

ADRIANA
And you have such a thing

RUFIO
And what may I ask is the occasion

ADRIANA
She dines with the Pope tomorrow

RUFIO
God bless her

As Adriana finishes with her face-paint she reaches for the bottle Rufio gave to her

CATHERINA (CONT’D)
No my dear Don’t touch Allow me

She takes the bottle and applies the salve carefully to her lips
Checks herself in whatever is there of the mirror Turns to Micheletto

CATHERINA (CONT’D)

She removes her arm from Micheletto’s and takes Cesare’s

CATHERINA
For old times sake

CESARE
Indeed Old times

As they walk upwards

CESARE (CONT’D)
Will my father be safe alone with you

CATHERINA
Were you safe

CESARE
Hardly

CATHERINA
Perhaps the hint of danger is what excites His Holiness

CESARE
lam sure of it

At the top of the staircase He pushes her into an alcove Brings his lips close to hers

CESARE (CONT’D)
No tricks Catherina
CATHERINA
Ihave no tricks left Alas

She looks into his eyes

CATHERINA (CONT’D)
Would you kiss me my Lord

CESARE

INT CASTEL ST ANGELO NIGHT

Though it is always night in here Micheletto walks through alone looks at Catherina’s empty

He rattles the doors alarmed

MICHELETTO
Guards Guards

INT DINING ROOM NIGHT

The Pope hands Catherina a glass of wine They stand overlooking the Roman evening

ALEXANDER
Rome can be beautiful on an autumn evening

CATHERINA
Your view is better than mine Holiness All I see of an evening are damp walls and cobwebs

ALEXANDER
Not quite the same

CATHERINA
But must I suffer that view indefinitely Your Holiness

ALEXANDER
Perhaps the answer is up to you Catherina Sforza

INT CASTEL ST ANGELO NIGHT
The guards come running Open the door for Micheletto

He runs inside the cell and rummages through the straw He finds a dying rat beside the vial of salve

MICHELETTO
Poison —
And he runs

CATHERINA
I have knelt only once Holiness Of my own free will

ALEXANDER
So If it is your will to kneel now perhaps your freedom can be assured

CATHERINA
And is that all I must do Holiness Kneel

ALEXANDER
Kneel Kiss this ring Swear eternal obedience to the Pope of Rome

She looks at him Holding the glass between two delicate fingers

CATHERINA
So You have won I finally declare myself

INT DINING ROOM NIGHT
Catherina rises brings her lips close to the pope’s

CATHERINA
They have tasted Borgia lips before But the son’s Not the father’s

ALEXANDER
Youth before age

CATHERINA
But if the son’s vigour is anything to go by the father should be —
And the doors crash open behind them Catherina looks round in confusion
Cesare is there

CESARE
Father - GET OUT — NOW —

INT CORRIDOR NIGHT

The anguished howl of Catherina Sforza echoes through the Vatican Micheletto listens
INT DINING ROOM NIGHT

Catherina Sforza is on the floor straddled by Cesare Borgia He is cutting off her lips

As he continues with his gruesome task

into his gullet

You are still my Lord
CESARE
A harsh future

They lead him off
INT CESARE’S QUARTERS DAY

CESARE
You can speak freely I guarantee you will come to no harm

The lady Sforza sent me to his rooms She gave me a note for him I know not what it said

CESARE
It doesn’t matter what it said What did he give you

ADRIANA
He told me to return in the morning He gave me a bottle of salve

CESARE
Salve

ADRIANA
I was told it was salve For her lips

MICHELETTO
You said a bottle Was it this bottle

He holds up the bottle Adriana nods nervously Cesare smiles at her

CESARE
You can leave us now

And she does Cesare looks from Micheletto to Rufio

RUFIO
Kill me now

CESARE
Not now

RUFIO
Oh The tedious business of the lash The strappado It just takes time my Lord Much simpler to kill
me now

CESARE
Why did you do it

RUFIO
I was sworn to you my Lord Never to your father And my mistress would have died the way she
lived I could not deny her that opportunity

CESARE
The pity is I had thought you were cleverer than that

RUFIO
We all have our weaknesses She was and always will be mine

CESARE
So You shall die in her presence then

RUFIO
How

MICHELETTO
Can I make a proposal my Lord

garb

INT VATICAN PALACE DAY
The French King with his retinue before the Pope of Rome with his his son Cesare amongst them

KING LOUIS
So your family’s ties with Naples have been severed

ALEXANDER
Sadly Our daughter’s husband turned out the worst of his Neapolitan kind A drunkard an ingratiate
a tavern brawler

KING LOUIS
And you your Holiness have no
more allegiance to that treacherous kingdom

Alexander looks to Cesare who replies for him

CESARE
Our hearts have long been set on the French alliance

KING LOUIS
So you will at last support our legitimate claims on Naples

ALEXANDER
You must tell us then what Naples is faced with

KING LOUIS
Surrender to us freely Or suffer a conquest The choice is theirs

ALEXANDER
Which is why we presume you brought an army with you

KING LOUIS
To bolster the forces we have already loaned your son Yes

ALEXANDER
Spain makes a similar claim to the
Kingdom of Naples

KING LOUIS
But Spain has no army in Rome That we are aware of
ALEXANDER
Who knows what armies are on their way here Your Highness One invading force disturbs the sleep
of Italy Two might give her nightmares

KING LOUIS
We are aware of Your Holiness’ ties to his ancestral homeland

ALEXANDER
So you will appreciate our concern here To maintain some balance

He holds out both hands like weighting scales

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
Between the conflicting claims on Naples

KING LOUIS
And we suspect His Holiness may in his infinite wisdom provide a solution

He bows graciously

ALEXANDER
Indeed One has already been mooted with your departing ambassador

KING LOUIS
Yes we have been so informed

ALEXANDER
French arms are free to invade
Naples if and only if —

KING LOUIS
They hold it in His Holiness’ name And they share the spoils of conquest with the Holy See and her
Catholic Majesties Ferdinand and Isabella

ALEXANDER
And

KING LOUIS
We respectfully agree In principle And we shall leave any issues of discord to be resolved by our
new ambassador to the Holy See

ALEXANDER
You have appointed a new ambassador Already

KING LOUIS
Forgive me Holiness Let me now introduce him
He claps his hands And a cowled figure from the French contingent steps forward

KING LOUIS (CONT’D)
The new French ambassador to the Holy See

The cowled figure steps forwards
The cowled figure kneels before the Pope And slips the cowl from his head

KING LOUIS (CONT’D)
Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere

The Pope stares at the unblinking eyes of Della Rovere And he finally manages to mutter

ALEXANDER
Cardinal

DELLA ROVERE
Holiness

And the Pope looks left at the sound of a sword being drawn

ALEXANDER
Cesare —

Cesare stops his sword-hand The French King smiles diplomatically

KING LOUIS
The ambassador will reside here under our protection under full diplomatic immunity

And the pope stretches forward his hand with the ring to be kissed
ALEXANDER
You may kiss the ring of St

Peter

DELLA ROVERE
Once more Gladly And humbly

INT VESTIBULE DAY

The vestier tries to remove the Pope’s clothes Cesare interrupts him
CESARE
Leave us —

And he begins to remove the Pope’s ceremonial garments

CESARE (CONT’D)
Do you think he knows Of your plan of succession

The Pope staring at himself in the mirror shakes his head

ALEXANDER
Not unless you have shared it —

CESARE
Never

ALEXANDER
No But he is clever as always He knows every Pope’s days are numbered Comes back to his old
haunt under full public view Has no scruples Knows he is untouchable With his coffers no doubt
funded to buy sufficient votes

The Pope smiles at his reflection

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
On reflection he would make an excellent Pope

CESARE
And how do we outplay him father

ALEXANDER
We do what we have always done my son We survive

EXT ST PETER’S DAY

As Della Rovere descends the steps surrounded by French soldiers he comes face to face with
Cesare and a band of his forces

CESARE
Cardinal

DELLA ROVERE
My Lord I would remind you I am under French protection

CESARE
These men are French So consider yourself under my protection too
DELLA ROVERE
Double the protection I am most re- assured

CESARE
May I walk with you

DELLA ROVERE
To my palace Indeed

CESARE
You have a palace already

DELLA ROVERE
Since my own has long been requisitioned yes I found myself in need of one

As they walk Cesare whispers

CESARE
I should have killed you a year ago
DELLA ROVERE
Yes You should have But your words were if I recall “I do not intend you to be dead For a very
long time”
CESARE

So we must breathe each other’s air now

DELLA ROVERE
Yes It will be most invigorating And if I am found poisoned garrotted stabbed beheaded there
will be consequences Of a geo-political nature

CESARE
So your health is secured then

DELLA ROVERE
I have always enjoyed good health thanks be to God

CESARE
And long may it continue

DELLA ROVERE
But as I told you then when you threatened me with a most painful future you should consider your
own
CESARE
My health

DELLA ROVERE
And your future Your father even with the blessing of the Most High cannot live forever

CESARE
I think my future is secure

DELLA ROVERE
With your armies They are the gift of France And of the church itself With your allies Allies can
bend with the prevailing wind As we both so well know

CESARE
So I should parlay with the one who would succeed my father

DELLA ROVERE
If your future is to be truly secure

CESARE
Tama warrior cardinal I live and breathe the air of battle I need it for a tonic an elixir I need it

dare I say it to keep alive And I have no doubt it will kill me some day

DELLA ROVERE
So you will enjoy the siege of Naples then

CESARE
If it doesn’t last forever

INT CASTEL ST ANGELO DAY
The cavernous central vault of the Castel St Angelo

Rufio sits in a cell with Catherina Sforza who looks like a death’s head now teeth exposed with
her lips missing

A jangle of chains and a series of doors open off

Rufio smiles at Catherina Sforza And we see he has a razor- blade clenched hidden between his
teeth

Micheletto enters the central vault stripped to the waist Cesare behind him a phalanx of soldiers
behind him

Every prisoner behind bars now stands to attention
MICHELETTO
Unchain him

Guards run to unchain Rufio And as he is unchained the prisoners begin baying for blood
Cesare raises his arms and finds silence

CESARE
The rules are simple

He looks around as silence descends

CESARE (CONT’D)
There are none

CESARE (CONT’D)
One blade each

Micheletto begins wrapping his left arm in a rag Cesare throws a blade at his feet
Another blade at the feet of Rufio

CESARE (CONT’D)
And one winner

The two blades stuck in the sand Rufio walks forwards and grips his
And as Micheletto bends for his Rufio rushes him The crowd bays for blood

Micheletto gripping his blade pivots on his left arm He kicks the feet from under Rufio sending
him spinning into the sand

Catherina gasps through her exposed teeth Rufio tumbles to the bars of an adjacent cage

And as he turns to right himself Micheletto is on him His blade headed straight for his jugular
Rufio feints catches the blade on his forearm He tumbles to release himself

But the first blood is Micheletto’s

And they now circle each other like cats Blood is streaming from Rufio’s forearm

One jab then another Neither hits home
Micheletto bends low as he approaches and surreptitiously sweeps a handful of dust from the
floor

He waits for Rufio to lunge and when he ducks to avoid his knife throws the dust in his eyes
Rufio tumbles to the floor momentarily blinded And Micheletto comes in for the kill

Rufio manages to swing sideways though and blindly stabs at Micheletto’s torso

His knife embeds itself to the hilt in Micheletto’s calf But he loses grip of the hilt

As he clears the dust from his eyes he raises his head to see appalled

Micheletto Standing One knife sticking from his calf The other in his sword-hand
Micheletto grimaces and pulls the knife from his calf with his left hand

He now has two knives

And Rufio is seemingly defenceless

MICHELETTO
Too simple

Blood is streaming from his calf but he hardly seems to notice

Micheletto circles Rufio both knives aloft He clucks at him like a chicken
The prisoners bay for him to finish it go in for the kill

But Micheletto plays him like a cat Draws stripes of blood across his chest

And finally goes for it Leaps upon him both knives aloft Rufio grips his descending wrists Stops
the knives But falls backwards towards the ground with the effort

And both knives are now bearing down towards his throat He twists his body beneath Micheletto
And the situation is now reversed Micheletto both knives pointing upwards as Rufio presses his
wrists downwards

Micheletto’s arms shake with the effort Every muscle bulges

And Rufio finally bears the blade hidden between his teeth
He slashes downwards with it at Micheletto’s neck

Micheletto gasps Blood spouts from the wound in his neck Into Rufio’s eyes
Who is momentarily once more blinded And Micheletto frees his wrists

Brings both knives slamming fatally into Rufio’s neck The crowd bays its approval

Rufio staggers to his feet Two knife-hilts jutting from his neck on either side

Micheletto staggers also to his feet His hand holds the wound on his neck staunching the blood

And Rufio falls to his knees Then backwards his face to the cavernous ceiling He dies with the
blade still clenched between his teeth

Micheletto bends down towards him He removes the blade from his teeth

MICHELETTO (CONT’D)
Clever

Cesare walks towards him

CESARE
So one legend dies

He wraps gauze around his neck wound

CESARE (CONT’D)
Another lives

INT CESARE’S QUARTERS NIGHT

Micheletto on some kind of trestle table Cesare attends his wounds cleaning them and binding
them

CESARE
I would attend your wounds myself my friend

MICHELETTO
Thank you

CESARE
And tell you I am sorry for the wound I caused you

MICHELETTO
It is forgotten

As Cesare cleans the wound on his neck
MICHELETTO (CONT’D)
Should we not be bound for Naples

CESARE
You know how slowly armies march I have sent our forces ahead of us We can join them for the
siege Take the shorter route

MICHELETTO
There will be a siege

CESARE
King Louis loves a siege

Cesare takes a knife

CESARE (CONT’D)
There is some grit in this wound It could fester

Micheletto grimaces

CESARE (CONT’D)
And there is the matter of my sister Her whereabouts

Cesare turns the knife Micheletto grimaces further

MICHELETTO
She swore me to secrecy my Lord

CESARE
So you know Where she is

MICHELETTO
Yes I could not lie to you I know where she is But I can never tell you No matter how you worry
that wound

Cesare extracts the blade There is a piece of metal on it

CESARE
There’s the culprit

He dips the blade in water

CESARE (CONT’D)
But you can swear to me that she is safe
MICHELETTO
She is safe my Lord I swear it

EXT COUNTRYSIDE MT VESUVIUS DAY

Cesare riding through a blasted landscape on the foothills of Vesuvius He is with Micheletto and
a platoon of soldiers He comes upon fields of dead cattle by a yellow brackish river

A peasant there tending the last living calf Cesare stops his horse

CESARE
Too highly perhaps

KING LOUIS
We can be patient We French are masters of the long siege Starve them into weakness Then attack

CESARE
When In winter
KING LOUIS
A depleted populace is always easier to conquer And it takes time

CESARE
What if I could deplete the populace in a week or less

KING LOUIS
And how would you achieve that

CESARE
Ihave my ways

KING LOUIS
Some necromancy Some alchemy

CESARE
Perhaps

KING LOUIS
So You are a wizard Cesare Borgia

CESARE
A warlock maybe

He looks at Micheletto

CESARE (CONT’D)
I have reason to hate Naples And everything inside it It humiliated my sister Her child

He stands
CESARE (CONT’D)
So if I could sap the will the lifeblood the life perhaps of that city ina week would you thank me

for it

KING LOUIS
We would be grateful But skeptical

CESARE

EXT COUNTRYSIDE MT VESUVIUS DAY

By the yellow river with the dead cows Cesare with the Wild Bunch Micheletto and a platoon of
troops

He has a map spread out on a convenient rock

CESARE
This water is poisoned

BAGLIONI
Poisoned with what

CESARE
I don’t care With some effluent from Vesuvius But if it can kill a bull it can kill a man The question

is how do we get the water from this river - to the city of Naples

Micheletto looks at the map

MICHELETTO
By any and every means

A MONTAGE —

Of barrel after barrel being filled from the yellow river

Of an improvised wooden aqueduct flowing with yellow water

Of the wooden aqueduct flowing with yellow water pouring into a pristine river

Of barrel after barrel being poured into pristine wells Of a fountain in Naples the mouth of a
Neptune statue pouring forth yellow water

Dead bodies everywhere It is like an Iraqi village after one of Saddam’s gas attacks Cesare
rides past them says to himself

CESARE

He stills his horse and waits for the French King to join him

KING LOUIS
But this is monstrous

CESARE
But war is monstrous
KING LOUIS
This is beyond all the rules of war All of the laws of God

CESARE

He leads his horse on

CESARE (CONT’D)
And Naples was and always will be a garden of weeds

EXT STREET NAPLES DAY

Cesare turns his horse into another street full of bodies The Wild Bunch stand there surveying
the horrible scene Baglioni is vomiting into the gutter

CESARE
You surprise me Baglioni I thought you had a stomach for warfare

BAGLIONI
Warfare I can deal with my lord

CESARE
But bodies in the street discomfit you And you are right

He looks at the ashen faces of his condiottore

CESARE (CONT’D)
Disease will follow as night follows day Have them cleared Burn them in a lime pit

PAULO ORSINI
Is there a lime pit big enough

CESARE
Then dig one

He turns his horse Micheletto follows him

Every problem has its solution

As he rides back with Micheletto he whispers to him

CESARE (CONT’D)

MICHELETTO
I saw fear

CESARE
And I saw betrayal Don’t let them out of your sight

INT VATICAN PALACE NIGHT
The Pope and Della Rovere

DELLA ROVERE
I have been asked by my Lord King Louis of France to convey his extreme abhorrence of your son’s
actions in Naples

ALEXANDER
But Naples has been conquered As King Louis desired

DELLA ROVERE
Ina manner against all laws of war And all laws of God

ALEXANDER
So the King’s war on Naples was a just war

DELLA ROVERE
It was given sanction by your Holiness himself

ALEXANDER
On the contrary He announced his intentions And made it clear that our reservations were of little
consequence

DELLA ROVERE
You supported him in spirit and your son —

ALEXANDER
Our son we believe afforded his entry to the city without the loss of one French life

DELLA ROVERE
He poisoned half the population

ALEXANDER
It is war ambassador Neither just nor godly A war King Louis chose A war you no doubt advised
him to choose

He eyes Della Rovere with contempt

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
So if Naples is to lie on anyone’s conscience cardinal let it lie on yours

EXT STREET NAPLES NIGHT
The bodies are being loaded onto wagons and dusted with lime
Baglioni the Orsini brothers and Vitelli are supervising

PAULO ORSINI
Is there any end to his ambition

VITELLI
No No end to his savagery either

BAGLIONI
Our estates will be next

VITELLI
So we are no longer his allies

BAGLIONI
Why should he stop here Umbria the Marches the whole of the Romagna

VITELLI
We were never his allies

BAGLIONI
We are and always have been his pawns

PAULO ORSINI
I have an aunt you know in a nunnery south of Rome Under Orsini patronage She told me of an
aristocratic charge that joined them

VITELLI
Who
PAULO ORSINI
Lucrezia Borgia

VITELLI
His sister a nun

PAULO ORSINI
She is in hiding She fears him too And she is the only thing he cares for In this world

BAGLIONI
And if we could —

PAULO ORSINI
I am ahead of you my friend I have a band of the Orsini waiting to be given the word To snatch her

She may be well be our only protection —

And as the soldiers grab another body to throw onto the wagons we see a lime-covered figure roll
to the base of the pile

It is Micheletto

He rolls into the shadow of a doorway and slips off

MICHELETTO
I have just one question sister When do they strike

SISTER BENVENUTA

When she says nothing he brings the knife close to her eyeball

MICHELETTO (CONT’D)

Finish your matins sisters We just want one among you who is no sister —

And the singing resumes then falters He bellows

GIAMBATTISTA ORSINI (CONT’D)
I said keep up the plain chant While we search out the Borgia amongst you —

As the camera cranes over the terrified singing nuns we find the back row is filled with men in
black habits Micheletto the band of soldiers

As the Orsini reach them they turn whip them off and the fun begins

It is no fair contest Almost a massacre as the terrified nuns keep up their singing

be your reward And I swear you shall have it

VITELLI

you will rule a vastly expanded principality Tyrants will fall one by one And one by one you shall
replace them We shall ride back to Rome Plan our last campaign And each of you shall return from

Lucrezia sits in the half empty church like a widow in mourning She looks up and sees Cesare
walking towards her
CESARE
Is the rumor true Sis That you considered taking Holy Orders

LUCREZIA
I even considered a name brother Sister Angela

CESARE
Sister Lucrezia is infinitely preferable

He stands above her

LUCREZIA
There is something to be said for the quiet of a nunnery Those sisters are at peace in their hearts

CESARE
And this sister is not

He places his hand against her cheek

LUCREZIA
No Not as yet

And she can’t resist it She touches his hand

CESARE
May I sit

LUCREZIA
You may

CESARE
I heard another rumor That my sister whom I love so much was hiding from me

LUCREZIA
Iam afraid brother To be in the same room as you

CESARE
You are afraid of me

LUCREZIA
You know what I’m afraid of Myself You’re here And I have that old illusion That God has
stepped in the room with us

CESARE
We are in St Peter’s God’s very room
LUCREZIA
Ah So that explains my beating heart

She lays her head on his shoulder

CESARE
And will you hide from me again

LUCREZIA
Yes I will leave again You will do your damndest To track me down again

CESARE
Ihave another solution sis You could marry

LUCREZIA
Ihave tried that Twice

CESARE
You could marry as I have done For convenience Then we would both be free to meet To love
Without scandal

LUCREZIA
Marry whom

CESARE
Some duke Some noble Some prince Whom such an arrangement suited Marriage should be nothing
to do with the heart Lucrezia I learned that in France Never confuse love with marriage

LUCREZIA
Yes The results can be lethal

CESARE
So have I your permission to begin the search

LUCREZIA
You The way our father did

He reaches for her She turns away

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)

Oh Cesare —

She takes his hand brings it to her cheek

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)
Oh my love I cannot wait To think a child of yours to play with Giovanni

And she turns away again

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)
You have won again haven’t you You knew the effect those words would have

CESARE
Can I be blamed for hoping

LUCREZIA
No

She plays with his hand over her lips

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)

BAGLIONI
Our survival

VITELLI
But does anyone yet know what happened At that bloody convent

Paulo Orsini looks from one to the other He knows something bad happened but he is not sharing
it

BAGLIONI
Come on Paulo —

ORSINI
My cousins came - but they had already left

BAGLIONI
They

ORSINI
Lucrezia Borgia And his — Micheletto

Vitelli takes a breath

VITELLI
So he knew Something was in the offing

ORSINI
How could he have known We still live

VITELLI
Can you call this living I can hardly sleep at night

ORSINI
Stay the course Bide your time He suspects perhaps but he doesn’t know And our moment will
come believe me —

And he raises his eyes Because a figure has come into view led towards him by a manservant

MANSERVANT
Signor Micheletto Corella

Micheletto bows

MICHELETTO
Gentlemen

They all nod their heads Disdainful or nervous it is hard to tell which

ORSINI
Micheletto

MICHELETTO
We all celebrate it seems the liberation of Naples

VITELLI
Yes We freed their souls all right

MICHELETTO
And there will be more it seems to celebrate

He looks around as the hush descends
MICHELETTO (CONT’D)
My Lord would meet with you tomorrow Fully armed your forces ready for the next campaign The
Pope Himself will bless you in your endeavours

The bunch look at each other Once more off the hook

VITELLI
Where are we headed

MICHELETTO
Only the Duke knows He keeps his counsel

And Micheletto bows and leaves
The bunch listen until the front door closes Then they raise their glasses

VITELLI
The Pope Himself will bless us —

INT VATICAN GARDENS NIGHT

A beautiful table set out on the lawns The Pope dines with Vanozza and Lucrezia and Pietro
Bembo

ALEXANDER
So tell us about your patron Pietro Bembo

BEMBO
Well the Duke D’Este is a man of impeccable taste

He glances at Lucrezia

BEMBO (CONT’D)
In all of the arts Painting sculpture

LUCREZIA
And poetry no doubt

ALEXANDER
He is a collector then But not of wives we hope

BEMBO
He was married once before He has long been a widower

VANOZZA
You can cut to the chase signor Bembo What he most wants in a woman is

BEMBO
An heir His first wife was barren He is of an age where men of his substance must think about
succession

VANOZZA
And beyond that

ALEXANDER
Vanozza —

VANOZZA
Hush Rodrigo Be so kind as to let me handle this one

BEMBO
Beyond that his future wife will be free to live as she sees fit

VANOZZA
With her own household With quarters of her own

BEMBO
With a palace of her own The Duke has his male companions

ALEXANDER
Ah He hunts He jousts

BEMBO
Far from it He enjoys the company of artists And their models

And here we can see the subtext however delicately expressed The Duke is gay

ALEXANDER
So his wife once an heir is produced shall be free of further marital responsibilities

BEMBO
She will be free as a bird

Lucrezia is staring at him He returns her gaze

LUCREZIA
I do like poetry Tasso Petrarch Dante

BEMBO
We shall have a lot to talk about then Should you ever reach Ferarra

Alexander and Vanozza exchange a glance

INT BALCONY VATICAN NIGHT

Cesare on a balcony outside the Pope’s chambers He is watching down below —
POV - VATICAN GARDENS —

Lucrezia Bembo and Vanozza laughing at the remains of the supper table

ON THE BALCONY —
The Pope comes to join Cesare

ALEXANDER
Bembo What do you know of him

CESARE
A poet I have been told In the court of Ferarra The Duke D’Este is known to enjoy his male
companions

ALEXANDER
Is that a bad thing in a husband

CESARE
It depends on what one wants of a husband

ALEXANDER
Your sister will want as little as possible And we will need allies in the North After tomorrow —

CESARE
Tell me

ALEXANDER
Sinigaglia has signaled its willingness to surrender its fortress We have summoned its Lord here to
hand the titles to us Send your condiotorre there to take possession And do what you will with them

INT VATICAN PALACE DAY
The Wild Bunch there in full armor Cesare still dressed casually as if he has just woken up

BAGLIONI
So what is our goal today my Lord

CESARE
Our goal Today as every other day

He smiles

CESARE (CONT’D)
Survival

He looks around at them and smiles

CESARE (CONT’D)
But you have a simple task ahead of you Sinigaglia
VITELLI
You intend another siege

CESARE
The Lord of Sinigaglia has told me his willingness to surrender In person to me In fact he rides
here as we speak

He smiles again

CESARE (CONT’D)
Our reputation for ferocity precedes us now Citizens will revolt Dukes will willingly fall rather
than face what happened at Naples

He stands
CESARE (CONT’D)

So I will receive the Lord here with his deeds of title while you take possession of his fortress You

will find the drawbridge down the gates open And this my friend is just the dawn of your
ascendancy

He opens the doors

CESARE (CONT’D)
Come Meet my father

INT CONCLAVE DAY
The Pope in full regalia in his ceremonial seat
Cesare stands to one side as Baglioni bends to kiss his ring

BAGLIONI
Holiness

Alexander blesses him

ALEXANDER
Heavenly father your warrior prepares for battle May he wear the breastplate of righteousness

Next in line we see the Orsini brothers and Vitelli waiting
Cesare catches his father’s eye The briefest of glances tells us everything

INT CESARE’S QUARTERS DAY
Cesare there with Machiavelli

MACHIAVELLI
I am writing a book my Lord

CESARE
You have forsaken diplomacy

MACHIAVELLI
It may have forsaken me

CESARE
Democracy doesn’t suit you

MACHIAVELLI
It hardly suits Florence But while the fashion for it holds I shall write my book

CESARE
A book on what

MACHIAVELLI
What I know best Power Princes

CESARE
Perhaps you can teach me something Of power and princes

MACHIAVELLI
Or perhaps it is the reverse my Lord Perhaps you are teaching me

CESARE
Then journey with me today To Sinigaglia

MACHIAVELLI
Why Sinigaglia

CESARE
Because there beginneth the lesson

EXT ROADSIDE DAY
Cesare Micheletto and Machiavelli riding along

MACHIAVELLI
What is the lesson called my Lord
CESARE
It is called revenge

INT BORGIA VILLA GARDENS EVENING
Lucrezia sits with Pietro Bembo in the evening light

LUCREZIA
Do you want to know the truth

BEMBO
Tell me

LUCREZIA
I would marry anyone that would ensure my freedom from this family

BEMBO
Oh my dear

LUCREZIA
I would even marry you

BEMBO
You could never marry me

LUCREZIA
But I may not have to

She looks straight into his eyes

BEMBO
So tell me about this family of yours

LUCREZIA
Will it hinder my marriage prospects The truth Between us

He shakes his head

LUCREZIA
Consider that they have lived through the age of Leonardo Raphael Donatello not to speak of the
greatest genius of them all - Michelangelo And what have they achieved

BEMBO
Power
LUCREZIA

Power to do what Italy is a wasteland Naples is a tomb Milan Even Leonardo has fled to France

What have they built What artists have they patronised

BEMBO
Pinturicchio

LUCREZIA
The little painter Is that all they leave to history

BEMBO
Their reputation

LUCREZIA
A reputation for mayhem Murder Bloodshed And an insatiable lust for power

She shivers

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)
And I am cold now Why am I cold

He reaches out a hand to touch her face

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)
No Do not touch me Yet

EXT SINIGAGLIA EVENING

The walls the moat

The condiotorre ride past ahead of their armies They come to the overpass or drawbridge

The citadel seems undefended
There is a gateman there fishing in the moat He hardly seems to notice their approach
Baglioni leads his horse across the bridge towards him

BAGLIONI
Where is the Lord

GATEMAN
Gone to Rome

BAGLIONI
And his army

GATEMAN
His army has gone fishing scattered to the hills

BAGLIONI
So we are expected

GATEMAN
Ina manner of speaking

He stands Bows gesturing them inside

GATEMAN (CONT’D)
Enter

One by one the condiotorre motion their horses through

And as their army makes to follow the gateman pulls a hidden lever

A portcullis crashes down

The horses rear panicked The army presses forwards in confusion but can do nothing
INT SINGALIA EVENING

Baglioni Paulo and Roberto Orsini and Vitelli find themselves in an empty square They look
back vainly at their armies pressed against the portcullis gates

VITELLI
What’s going on

Paulo Orsini looks the most worried

ORSINI
I think I know

BAGLIONI
What do you know Orsini

Suddenly pages blow in the wind across the empty square Niccolo Machiavelli runs out from
under an arch chasing his pages

MACHIAVELLI
Pardon me gentlemen
As he catches the pages

MACHIAVELLI (CONT’D)
My papers

As he catches page after page soldiers of the papal army step out from the shadows and take their
places along the walls

Orsini whips his horse into a gallop He rides through the square looking for an exit

Micheletto jumps from a balcony and drags him to the ground The three remaining condiotorre
stay rooted to the spot trying to still their nervous horses

And now Cesare Borgia walks into the square He picks one of Machiavelli’s pages from the
cobblestones

CESARE
Signor Machiavelli is writing a book

He hands Machiavelli the page He walks up to Baglioni Holds the reins of his horse

CESARE (CONT’D)
On power and princes

BAGLIONI
I did not know that my Lord

CESARE
But you knew all about my sister did you not The attempt on her life

Paulo Orsini reaches for his sword

CESARE (CONT’D)
Don’t Paulo If you want an easeful death

Machiavelli stares as armed men surround the plotters
MACHIAVELLI (VO)
And so began the beautiful deception of Sinigaglia which every prince should study for his
advancement

INT PALAZZO SINIGAGLIA NIGHT

Baglioni is dragged down a set of dank stairs He points at Paulo Orsini being dragged behind
him

BAGLIONI
It was him - he led us to it —

Cesare stands at the top of the stairs

CESARE
Well Then he shall die the same death as you

INT PALAZZO BASEMENT NIGHT
Vitelli with a garotte around his neck
The others sit watching appalled and bound

VITELLI
I beg the Pope to grant indulgence for my sins —

MICHELETTO
I shall convey your request my Lord

INT BANQUET ROOM SINIGAGLIA NIGHT
Cesare dining with Machiavelli As Cesare talks Machiavelli takes notes

MACHIAVELLI (VO)
Fortune is a woman To keep her under the Duke deemed it necessary to beat her and ill-use her

INT PALAZZO BASEMENT NIGHT

The Orsini brothers are bound together by the same garotte Micheletto is strangling them both
Baglioni stares from a chair in horror

MICHELETTO
Do not fret my Lord You will not have to share

INT BANQUET ROOM SINIGAGLIA NIGHT
Cesare and Machiavelli Cesare still talking

MACHIAVELLI (VO)
And being a woman she is a lover of young men

INT PALAZZO BASEMENT NIGHT
Three bodies lying bleeding from the neck Micheletto garrotes the last of them Baglioni

MACHIAVELLI (VO)
because they are less cautious more violent and can with more audacity command her

EXT ROAD TO ROME DAWN

Cesare Machiavelli and Micheletto thunder through on their way back to Rome
INT POPE’S QUARTERS DAY

Cesare the Pope and Machiavelli In a private hellish conclave

ALEXANDER
Write this down signor Machiavelli

As Machiavelli scribbles

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
Our enemies are either dead held prisoner or are fugitives Even if they stand their ground they
nonetheless consciously await their fates So the dragon devours lesser serpents

CESARE
There remains Della Rovere

MACHIAVELLI
And how will you deal with him my
Lord

ALEXANDER
We will invite him to dinner

INT BORGIA VILLA DAY
Lucrezia with Pietro Bembo in the dining room

BEMBO
You can be free of your family

LUCREZIA
Ican dream

BEMBO
We have agreed to their terms They want more of gold and plate and of oaths of allegiance than any
Ceasar But the Duke desires this match

LUCREZIA
Why

BEMBO
Because I have told him You are more beautiful than Helen

LUCREZIA
I thought he didn’t care for women

BEMBO
He cares for beauty You will bring him your child And bear him another He cares for that

LUCREZIA
When can I meet him

BEMBO
When you come to Ferarra But he is graciousness itself Believe me

LUCREZIA
I can create an academy perhaps Leave something for the future

BEMBO
And you will have a friend there Always In me

LUCREZIA
Just a friend

BEMBO
More than a friend If that’s what you want

He looks at her

BEMBO (CONT’D)
And kiss me Now

She looks at him She does so
And just at that point Cesare enters into view on the walkway visible through the window

CESARE
Sis —

They draw apart Cesare walks on But he has seen them
LUCREZIA
Go now

BEMBO
Why the hurry I have to give your brother the duke’s terms

LUCREZIA
I will give them And believe me he probably knows them already

BEMBO
Is he that alarming

LUCREZIA
Jealous is the word Of any happiness I might snatch Without him

She hurries him out the doorway

EXT BORGIA VILLA DAY

Lucrezia puts two fingers to his lips as she sends Bembo off
INT BORGIA VILLA DAY

Lucrezia comes back up the stairs to find Cesare at the top

CESARE
Sister

LUCREZIA
Cesare

CESARE
I had hoped to meet Bembo

LUCREZIA
Oh he gives his apologies He had forgotten a prior engagement

He looks at her closely

CESARE
Perhaps it’s just as well

LUCREZIA
You think
CESARE
Yes

He puts his arm around her

CESARE (CONT’D)
Ferrara is far weaker than I thought And Florence is not keen on that alliance

LUCREZIA
Ah We must not disappoint Florence

CESARE
We can happily but there are other possibilities In France for instance

LUCREZIA
France

CESARE
France is full of gouty dukes and princes in need of an heir

LUCREZIA
But all that will take time brother

CESARE
Perfect And we shall put it to perfect use

He kisses her on the cheek

CESARE (CONT’D)
And I have a favour to ask That only one with your grace could deliver to me

LUCREZIA
Ask then

CESARE
Cardinal Della Rovere We would invite him to dine with us

LUCREZIA
With us

CESARE
With me and our father To discuss our differences See if we can put them to rest

LUCREZIA
Why me

CESARE
Let me count the answers

He puts his arms around her

CESARE (CONT’D)
You are intelligent you are diplomatic you are beautiful and you are and always will be

He kisses her

CESARE (CONT’D)
MINE

EXT ROMAN STREETS DAY

Lucrezia walks through the streets a hood covering her head She turns into a magnificent
palazzo

INT DELLA ROVERE’S PALAZZO DAY
Lucrezia before cardinal Della Rovere

DELLA ROVERE
To what do I owe the pleasure donna Lucrezia

LUCREZIA
Iam merely a messenger cardinal

DELLA ROVERE
And the message

LUCREZIA
An invitation to dine with His Holiness the Pope and the Duke Valentino

Della Rovere smiles

DELLA ROVERE
And should I accept

LUCREZIA
If you value your health no
DELLA ROVERE
You surprise me lady

LUCREZIA
I know I surprise even myself

DELLA ROVERE
With your honesty Your bluntness

LUCREZIA
They will be rid of you If not on this occasion on another

DELLA ROVERE
My answer then will have to be no

She stays looking at him

LUCREZIA
The French King has gone You are less protected Their day will come

DELLA ROVERE
And why should that concern you

LUCREZIA
Perhaps we have an interest in common

DELLA ROVERE
And what could that possibly be

LUCREZIA
The future I have a child I wish him to have one

DELLA ROVERE
And

LUCREZIA
You belong to a church You wish it to have one

DELLA ROVERE
A future

LUCREZIA
You were a good man once You could be pope one day
DELLA ROVERE
I am intrigued

INT POPE’S QUARTERS DAY
The Pope and Cesare Lucrezia enters She says nothing to Cesare’s enquiring glance

CESARE
He said no

LUCREZIA
Not at all He said yes But insists that he will choose the venue

ALEXANDER
Clever

CESARE
Do we refuse

ALEXANDER
We can’t But we take the occasion to set him at his ease Sound him out There will be other dining
opportunities

CESARE
Will it be safe father For us

ALEXANDER
We have our tasters

CESARE
Another evening dining on cold scraps

Lucrezia interjects

LUCREZIA
Eat something small before you go brother A collation Then at least you can enjoy the wine

INT VATICAN DINING ROOM EVENING

Father and son walking round a small table filled with food Lucrezia sits by a window in the
background

ALEXANDER
We need an intermediary with him to lay a layer of trust An ambassador so to speak
He eats

CESARE
We have one

He turns to Lucrezia

ALEXANDER
Lucrezia

CESARE
He trusts her enough to accept our invitation

LUCREZIA
And that may be all the trust one gets in Rome

ALEXANDER
That may be all one needs This game will be long my son and many sided Each move will have its
implications

LUCREZIA
But I will soon be lost to you father In Ferarra I believe

ALEXANDER
We are re-considering Ferarra are we not

He looks to Cesare Lucrezia lowers her eyes

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
And eat something now so you can keep your wits about you-

Cesare eats something
EXT VILLA NIGHT

A banquet table entirely draped in muslin The loud noise of cicadas can be heard the unearthly
whine of mosquitos

As the camera creeps closer to the scene we see there are thousand of mosquitos dead against the
muslin And more are flying against it by the second

Inside the muslin at a magnificent banquet are Cardinal Della Rovere Cesare Borgia and his
father the pope

Both Cesare and Rodrigo have tasters on either side of them
DELLA ROVERE
Rome is particularly lethal this summer

ALEXANDER
Indeed By the lake With the heat The mosquitos

DELLA ROVERE
But one leaves it at one’s peril don’t you think

ALEXANDER
We would be safer in the hills But our enemies would prosper in the swamp we had left behind

4 MOSQUITO —

Now buzzing towards the Pope He swats it away with his wet handkerchief then refreshes it in the
lemon-scented water

DELLA ROVERE
So you might agree then We must find a solution to this perpetual rancour This division Or the
world will force it upon us

ALEXANDER
We have considered a solution that the world might not be ready for

DELLA ROVERE
Would you be so kind as to share it with me

Alexander glances towards Cesare and says nothing

CESARE
We would hear your solution first cardinal

DELLA ROVERE
My solution has the benefit of originality And it even has a precedent

ALEXANDER
We are all ears

DELLA ROVERE
If a Pope were to resign in the full of his health it would send out a sign to the whole of
Christendom

ALEXANDER
A sign of what cardinal
DELLA ROVERE
A sign that the occupant had forsaken self-interest And had no further interest in the advancement of
his family It would restore the name of Borgia to - dare I say it - respectability Even perhaps
sanctity

Cesare smiles

CESARE
Our father the saint

Alexander smiles bitterly

DELLA ROVERE
You must taste the quail Holiness

ALEXANDER
When it is tasted for us

The taster chews Seems to like it

DELLA ROVERE
And we have here Holiness a perfect metaphor for your papacy

ALEXANDER
How pray

DELLA ROVERE
The quail is delicious It is I can assure you uncontaminated But who enjoys it

The taster stares at the Pope his mouth full

DELLA ROVERE (CONT’D)
His Holiness is the last to partake By which time the dish is hardly warm The most succulent meats
have been already consumed The taster grow fat while His Holiness starves

ALEXANDER
Great office does come with its own privations

DELLA ROVERE
But if you were to step down Holiness in the fullness of your vigour and health The world would
have to recognise your probity Your lack of nepotism Your sanctity even

ALEXANDER
And who would succeed me
DELLA ROVERE
That would be for the conclave to decide

ALEXANDER
You

DELLA ROVERE

If the Holy Spirit wills it But I could guarantee in the event of my succession

He glances round at the tasters

DELLA ROVERE (CONT’D)
Could my words be for your ears alone Holiness And those of your son

Alexander takes the plate of quail

ALEXANDER
Leave us

DELLA ROVERE
And enjoy my repast

As the tasters leave

DELLA ROVERE (CONT’D)
-finally

EXT MUSLIN TABLE NIGHT

The muslin billows as the tasters depart

A MOSQUITO - flies to the muslin as if desperately trying to enter
INT TABLE NIGHT

As Alexander finally eats

ALEXANDER
It is delicious cardinal

DELLA ROVERE
And retains some heat we hope

ALEXANDER
So continue in the event of your succession

DELLA ROVERE
In the event of my succession I could guarantee your son’s position

CESARE
As

DELLA ROVERE
As prince of the territories he now holds Of a new principality in central Italy Whose capital is
Rome

CESARE
And the Pope

DELLA ROVERE
Would rule his spiritual kingdom while the Prince rules his temporal one

ALEXANDER
And we would retire To gardening perhaps Beekeeping

DELLA ROVERE
You would retire to whatever estate you chose To enjoy the fruits of your long labours With a
reputation unblemished Of probity humility and dare I say it sanctity

ALEXANDER
Sanctity

DELLA ROVERE
Were I alive as pope when the Almighty finally gathered you to His loving arms it is not beyond the
bounds of possibility

ALEXANDER
Saint Rodrigo

Cesare smiles

CESARE
Saint Alexander father

Della Rovere claps his hands

DELLA ROVERE
And now that we have broached this delicate matter your Holiness should recall your tasters while
another wine is poured
Alexander nods his head and the tasters return

EXT MUSLIN TABLE NIGHT

ANOTHER MOSQUITO - buzzing down from the Heavens This one seems to mean business
INT TABLE NIGHT

The tasters taste the wine They nod in nervous approval Alexander’s glass is filled Della Rovere
stands

DELLA ROVERE
I would propose a toast Your Holiness While our ambitions would seem at odds they need not be
So I would drink to harmony between those ambitions And to peace between us

Alexander nods

ALEXANDER
To Harmony

DELLA ROVERE
Harmony And peace

ALEXANDER
And peace

DELLA ROVERE
My Lord Borgia

Cesare raises his glass They drink Alexander raises his glass once more

ALEXANDER
And we would propose our own toast

As he raises his glass he suddenly collapses into Cesare’s arms

CESARE
Father —

ALEXANDER
We feel —

And he suddenly vomits blood and bile over Cesare and the table-cloth
He turns and stares at Della Rovere

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
How did you manage —

Della Rovere stares aghast

DELLA ROVERE
Manage what

CESARE
You are ill Father -

He calls
CESARE (CONT’D)
ALEXANDER
Poisoned —
And Cesare drags his father through the muslin as Della Rovere tries to help

CESARE
You will die for this —

And as the guards support his father Cesare turns and grips Della Rovere by the throat

CESARE (CONT’D)
-in agony-

And Cesare goes rigid as if gripped by a rictus He suddenly vomits blood over Della Rovere’s
costume

He falls back into the muslin cloth dragging the whole tent with him

And Della Rovere stares aghast at Cesare Borgia rolling in agony through the blood-stained tent
of muslin

Over the chaotic scene Machiavelli takes up the tale
MACHIAVELLI (VO)

If the Duke did not succeed in his plans it was not his fault but was instead the result of an
extraordinary and extreme instance of ill-fortune
INT THE VATICAN NIGHT

The pope and his son carried through the corridors which are swarming with Vatican guards and
terrified cardinals

MACHIAVELLI (VO)
For Alexander fell ill five years after he had drawn his sword

On Cesare’s sweating vomiting face staring at the ornate ceiling above him

MACHIAVELLI (VO)
and though he had prepared for everything that might happen he never dreamed that at the time of
his father’s illness he too would be at death’s door

INT PAPAL BEDROOM NIGHT

Alexander taking long and painful breaths while Lucrezia and Vanozza wipe his sweating
forehead

ALEXANDER
Did I take the wrong path Vanozza So long ago I cannot now remember

VANOZZA
I can remember The day and the hour
ALEXANDER
Forgive me then

VANOZZA
You don’t need my forgiveness You need the forgiveness of God Almighty

ALEXANDER
I must confess my sins

LUCREZIA
Hush father hush

ALEXANDER
With whatever breath I have left

Vanozza walks to the door
INT CORRIDOR NIGHT

The huddled semi-circle of cardinals
VANOZZA
He needs a confessor —

And every cardinal turns away Scurries down the corridor

VANOZZA (CONT’D)
Itis your duty - under God - to hear his last confession -

INT PAPAL BEDROOM NIGHT
The Pope Sweating on the bed He has long since stopped pleading for help

And now he wakes once more To see a figure cowled like a monk behind the curtains on the
balcony

ALEXANDER
Who is there

The curtains shift

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
Water please

MONK
Ihave no water

ALEXANDER
My lips are parched

MONK
As are mine

ALEXANDER
But you are a Franciscan You have come to hear my confession

The monk moves into the room

ALEXANDER (CONT’D)
Thanks be to the living God

MONK
You would have me hear your sins

ALEXANDER
I would I would cleanse my soul of every stain upon it
MONK
The whole world knows your sins Your soul is blacker than a moonless night

ALEXANDER
But there can be light again in
God’s forgiveness

MONK
For sins such as yours Fornication Adultery Murder Simony A greed for gold that had no
boundary

ALEXANDER
We know that God’s mercy is infinite

MONK
That is true

ALEXANDER
And that even the worst of sinners can beg forgiveness with his last breath of life

MONK
True again

ALEXANDER
So I Rodrigo Borgia beg forgiveness with my last words my last breath upon this earth

MONK
But forgiveness for you Rodrigo
Borgia is impossible

ALEXANDER
Why

MONK
Because you have taken your last breath

ALEXANDER
Ihave When

MONK
Does it matter when A second or an infinity You are dead You can confess your sins for ten

eternities and God will not hear them This is hell and you are in it

Smoke is now billowing from the monk’s cowl Alexander reaches out to grab it It bursts into
flame

ALEXANDER
No pope belongs in hell —

And the flames seem to speak

MONK
This one does

And the bed is burning underneath him now Alexander tries to rise

Behind him we see the frescoes have turned into images of hell from Heironymus Bosch
Alexander screams as the flames consume him

CUT TO -

A face leaning down towards him with a feather

Lucrezia

LUCREZIA
He has breathed his last

ON ALEXANDER’S DEAD FACE ALREADY TURNING BLACK

Vanozza prays beside him

And now like a group of red vampires the cardinals enter circling round dropping to their knees
INT CESARE’S QUARTERS DAY

Cesare like a barely-moving skeleton lying on his bed All of the shutters are closed against the
daylight Lucrezia enters

LUCREZIA
Our father is dead

Cesare can hardly speak Eventually he says —

CESARE
When

LUCREZIA
Two hours ago Nobody will touch the body But it seems that you might live brother —

CESARE
So who did it sis

LUCREZIA
Whoever stood to profit by it Is that not the Vatican way

CESARE
Della Rovere

LUCREZIA
So He will make a perfect candidate for Pope

CESARE
He was our last standing enemy —

LUCREZIA
You must cultivate his favour then Or do as I am doing Leave this charnel house

She stands

CESARE
Sis —

LUCREZIA
Yes brother

CESARE
You must help me to avenge this crime

LUCREZIA
I can think of no better vengeance than the throne of St Peters

She takes his head in her hands and kisses his lips She says softly

LUCREZIA (CONT’D)
Look what it did to us

EXT STREETS OF ROME DAY

Micheletto drives a carriage out of Rome Inside it we see the sweating feverish figure of Cesare
Borgia

MACHIAVELLI (VO)
A prince may be seen happy today and ruined tomorrow without having shown any change in his
character

INT LIBRARY DAY
Machiavelli scribbling with a feathered pen

MACHIAVELLI (VO)
For the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it changes

The camera tracks into the vellum page as he writes

The thundering hooves of horses over a dusty arid landscape

Cesare Borgia is riding sword drawn towards an oncoming group of horsemen He is flung from
his horse by a spear that pierces him through As he falls he calls out —

CESARE
Micheletto

Micheletto turns leaps from his horse runs back towards him As he runs arrow after arrow
pierces him twisting his body this way and that Then a shot from an arquebus shatters his
shoulder throwing him into the dust

As his hand reaches out for Cesare’s the camera tracks into Cesare’s dying face

IT DISSOLVES INTO —

The portrait of Cesare Borgia by Altobello Melone A legend reads

LEGEND
Cesare Borgia died fighting vainly to reclaim the lands and territories he had once conquered

EXT HILLTOP IN FERRARA DAY
A party on horse back A carriage behind them Lucrezia Vanozza Giovanni and Pietro Bembo

Lucrezia Borgia lived out her life as Duchess of Ferrara patroness of the arts and of the poet
Pietro Bembo
