“WIDEN TO REVEAL

INT ANDY’S ROOM - MORNING

It’s a video game on a TV screen The image looms above us like
an Imax movie but down at the very bottom we see the small
silhouette of BUZZ LIGHTYEAR sitting in front of the TV playing
the game Buzz holds a huge joystick

Buzz starts shooting back Two more silhouettes shaped like REX
and HAMM hurry in front of the TV

HAMM
Uh-oh that pesky Zurg character
Use your time warp cannon

REX
Really I would use my terillium
shield
BUZZ
(proudly)

I11 de-moleculize him with my
antimatter phaser

Hamm tries to grab the joystick

PAN OVER TO REVEAL

Woody stands on the shelf next to the TV On his doodle pad

Woody has drawn a makeshift calendar with a few days left to go
until the day marked CAMP OVER - ANDY BACK Woody crosses off
another day props the pad against a book so the room can see it

WOODY
Guys next time I’m stranded on an
alien planet there’s no one I’d
rather have lead the rescue party
than Buzz Lightyear

As Woody speaks he sees something through Andy’s window For a
split second Mrs Davis walks by carrying a few items including
what might have been a GARAGE SALE sign--she’s gone before
Woody can tell Woody mouths the words GARAGE SALE

There’s a HAMMERING NOISE outside Woody looks worried He
scopes out the room across the room is the window and a dresser
in front of it In bg we hear a CASIO WINNING FANFARE

REX (0S)
High score You did it Buzz

HAMM (0S)
Way to go Super Buzzio

WOODY

Woody hops down to the floor and starts heading for the window
Slinky approaches In bg other toys play rambunctiously

SLINKY

Slinky looks up nervously

SLINKY

WOODY
(laughs)

Woody walks away Slinky continues to look around nervously
Woody salutes as he approaches Sarge who leads the ALIENS as
they try to march in place The Aliens SQUEAK out of unison

SARGE
Hut hut hut Let’s move it

WOODY
Lookin’ good Sarge The few the
proud the Aliens
(he laughs at his own joke)
Hey Sarge where’s the regular
army

SARGE
Sir the men are on leave Sir

Sarge motions to SEE ’N SAY The GREEN ARMY MEN (in hawaiian
shirts) are gathered around using See ’N Say as a roulette wheel
and CHEERING

WOODY
Great Sarge Keep that morale up

Woody walks by Rex who’s holding MIKE’s mike reading from a
book to a group of LITTLE TYKES As Rex reads he gets more
carried away shouting more passionately with every word

REX
See Dick See Dick run Oh no
“Run Dick run I can’t go any
further The suspense is killing me
(sees Woody)
Woody Care to join us for a book
discussion group

WOODY
Later Rex I’ve got some business
to check on

Rex and Woody are distracted by a loud KISSING NOISE

WOODY
(smiles)
Uh oh turn your heads Little
Tykes They’re at it again

Woody looks toward a DOLL HOUSE MR and MRS POTATO HEAD stand
in the side yard smooching Like two lovebirds
ror

POTATO HEAD
(syrupy-sweet voice)
Aww who’s my widdle tater tot

MRS POTATO HEAD
Ooh you’re my itty bitty wuv spud

Woody gets a silly grin then continues on
‘HOLD ON DOLL HOUSE

Mr and Mrs Potato Head finish kissing His lips are stuck to
hers He pulls them off and reattaches them Hamm approaches

HAMM

He points to a can of Lincoln Logs Hamm shrugs exits As he
leaves

HAMM
(under breath)
Man that is one whipped potato

ANGLE ON THE TOP OF ANDY’S DRESSER

Woody climbs onto the top He starts to peer out the window but
BO PEEP pulls him back with her crook

WOODY
Bo Why’d you do that
BO PEEP
So I could do this

She leans Woody back out of frame to KISS him As Woody’s legs
rise up into frame we see a thread in his pants catch on a loose
screw on the dresser The thread RIPS but Woody’s too
distracted to notice

BO PEEP
That’s for doing such a good job
keeping the toys happy while Andy’s
been away

WOODY
(dazed)
Howuzzah ishkabibble

BO PEEP
If you need me Sheriff you know
what to do Just give me a ring

She suggestively removes a ring from the ring toss pole and
rolls it to Woody’s feet Woody stares stupidly at the ring
then snaps out his daze and turns around to look out the window

He sees Mrs Davis hammering a sign into the ground The sign
reads “GARAGE SALE

WOODY
(sighs)
Great This is the last thing
the toys need

REX (0S)
Hey Woody

Woody turns around sees Rex is coming Woody panics and yanks
Andy’s window shade down covering the window Woody stands
there straining to hold the shade down trying to look
nonchalant

REX
Could you hand me The Pokey Little
Puppy The Little Tykés are
demanding something more
sophisticated

Laying on the dresser is the book The Pokey Little Puppy
Woody stretches to reach the book with his hand while holding
the shade down by placing his feet on the shade’s pullring He
hands Rex the book smiling nervously
REX
Woody Are you hiding something
behind that shade

WwooDY
Me What Never Why who ever
heard of anything so

THWIPP-P-P The shade pulls up yanking Woody up with a FLAP
FLAP FLAP The other toys in the room stop playing and watch as
Woody lands in a heap on the bed He jumps up composes himself

WOODY
Not a problem I’m fine Keep on
playing
Rex examines the window
REX

Why Woody there’s nothing back
here to hide at all I don’t see
anything except for a sign that
says GARAGE SALE

HAMM
Garage sale

SLINKY
Garage sale

Panic breaks out The Little Tykes hop in the toy chest and SLAM
the lid The SHEEP hide under Bo Peep’s skirt Mrs Potato Head
runs into her doll house and shuts all the windows Woody hops
down to the floor

WOODY
Everyone calm down It’s just a
garage sale

POTATO HEAD
Garage sale That’s worse than
being given to the puppy

WOODY
Come on there’s no need to worry

REX -o
Strangers poking and prodding at my
soft underbelly--how humiliating

WOODY
Rex No one is going to get poked
HAMM
Sure sell the kid’s toys when he’s
away at camp He’1l be in therapy
for life

WOODY

Everyone quiet

(the toys settle down)
Relax None of us are going to the
garage sale Mom wouldn’t sell any
of us with Andy away at camp
Besides garage sales are only for
old toys

POTATO HEAD
Woody’s right We shouldn’t be
worried He should He’s the
oldest toy around here Woody’s
practically an antique

WOODY
Oh I am not an antique

As Woody gestures to make his point the ripped stitch POPS
on Woody looks down sees some stuffing is coming out of his pants

REX
Don’t worry Woody Just because
you’re falling apart that doesn’t
change how much we love you

WOODY
Hey I am not falling apart I’ve
just been heavily loved

Woody tries to act cool as he kicks the stuffing back in his
pants

HAMM
Hmm fiberurethane Now that’s

been banned since the seventies

windowsill his feet dangling out the open window over the garage
roof Woody stews as he shoves the stuffing back in

apart Just cause a fellah looses

the garage roof

boot but to no avail

To Al‘’s Toy Barn and beyond

Buzz leads the toys down the ivy trellis as we
DISSOLVE TO
An imposing high-rise apartment building in a large city The
“LZTYBRN” car parks in front of the high-rise Al steps out
carrying Woody He enters an outdoor elevator
INT AL‘’S APARTMENT - FRONT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
It’s a penthouse decorated with framed covers of business
magazines featuring Al’s picture a collection of Pez dispensers
and a wall of framed photos all of various toys
Al enters carrying Woody He WHISTLES and tries to act
nonchalant which only makes him appear suspicious As soon as
he closes the door behind him
AL
Yes Yes Yessss A genuine
first edition Woody

Al does a little victory dance around the apartment
lo

Al stops dancing and stares at Woody lovingly

AL
At last The mother lode

INT AL’S APARTMENT - WORK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Woody is carried across the room rimmed with floor-to-ceiling
shelves full of boxes The boxes have labels such as Captain
Platypus Dinky Doodle’s Playhouse and Rococco The Clown

Woody is carried toward a workbench Protruding from the bench
is a big clamp Al puts Woody on the workbench and clamps his
head into a fixed position

wooDy’S POV
Operating room style lights blare down from overhead

Al stares down into Woody’s eyes Al holds up a gq-tip then dips
it in a jar bearing a skull and crossbone and label DANGER
CORROSIVE

Al grins and slowly lowers the dripping Q-tip right into Woody’s
eyes The Q-tip SQUEAKS as grime is painstakingly rubbed off of
Woody’s eyes

Next Al holds up a WHIRRING buffing wheel Then he applies the
buffing wheel to Woody’s face -

Finally Al puts down the buffer and holds up a gleaming metal
dentist’s hook He dips the hook a test tube of liquid plastic
bubbling over a bunsen burner A drop of molten plastic dangles
from the instrument Al applies it menacingly to Woody’s
forehead

ANGLE ON WOODY

We see that Al is repairing the burned indentation in Woody’s
forehead Woody looks brand new shiny as a waxed apple

Al stands up admires Woody He goes to the shelf and pulls off
marked Woody’s Roundup Al carries Woody and the box into
em

INT AL‘S APARTMENT - DISPLAY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Al enters places three toys from the box--a HORSE and old
PROSPECTOR DOLL and a CACTUS--along with Woody on cushy display
pillows He exits WIDEN to reveal this is a spartan pristine
room full of polished glass displays Woody frantically looks
around for an exit

SRTA CACTUS
(whispers to Prospector)
It’s Woody Someone introduce me

PROSPECTOR

SRTA CACTUS
(similar accent)
Hey I am mint You’re the one

Woody runs for the door slipping around on the super-polished
floor Woody tries the door it’s shut tight

WOODY
Come on guys help me get outta

Woody runs to the window starts trying to open it It won’t
budge Then Woody looks out the window and is terrified by what
he sees a huge expanse of city twenty stories below Andy’s
house is nowhere in sight

wooDY

SRTA CACTUS

PROSPECTOR

thought of as Collectibles

WOODY
Uh huh And I prefer to think of
you as loonies

BULLSEYE
Fellahs I don’t think he knows
he’s a collector’s item
(r

SRTA CACTUS
(realizing)
Oh of course He’s been played
with--corrupted by a kid

They hop down from the display walk over to Woody

PROSPECTOR
Now see here Woody This escaping
fiddle faddle has got to stop now

SRTA CACTUS
Let’s get one thing clear You’re
not going to be played with any more

PROSPECTOR
You’re a collector’s item now
You’ve graduated to a whole new
plane of toy existence

WOODY
Right And you’ve graduated from
loony to “total nutcase

Woody starts to walk away The Prospector grabs Woody by the
shoulder turns Woody around

PROSPECTOR
Qld boy do you know how long we’ve
been waiting for you You’re the
centerpiece of the Woody’s
Roundup collection Look

WOODY’S POV - SCANNING THE DISPLAY

A lunchbox with Woody’s face on it An old lp with Woody’s face
on the sleeve A board game box with Woody and Bullseye on it
etc

Towering over the display is a massive antique poster advertising
a fifties TV kids show The poster depicts Woody riding on
Bullseye with the Prospector and Senorita Cactus standing
nearby The poster reads DuMont Network presents Woody’s
Roundup

SRTA CACTUS
Congratulations boy -You’re a
star

PROSPECTOR
You’re not a toy anymore You’re
one of us now

WOODY
(overwhelmed gurgle)
Harrrghumph

Woody faints falls on his face

SRTA CACTUS
He scuffed his sheen

PROSPECTOR
Get the buffer

CUT TO
MONTAGE TO FOLLOW - EN ROUTE TO AL’S TOY BARN

Buzz leads the toys on a trek to Al’s Toy Barn Through a series
of mishaps and bad decisions one by one the toys lose faith in
Buzz until at last Buzz loses faith in himself Buzz wonders
why he ever thought a mere toy could journey across town

CUT TO
INT AL’S APARTMENT - DISPLAY ROOM - DAY

Woody is lying on the floor his arm stretched under the door
He’s tied his belt and bandanna into a lasso He slips his arm
under the door and GRUNTS as he tries to lasso the doorknob
overhead With each failed attempt Woody gets more and more
downhearted Bullseye comes over starts nonchalantly tossing
his horseshoe

BULLSEYE
(covert code)
So I see we have similar
interests

Woody misses with the lasso again

WwooDY
Similar I’m not some
collectible who hates being a
toy I’m nothing like you

BULLSEYE
(looks around
the coast is clear)
You’re everything like me I liked
being a toy I was played with
too back in the fifties

wooDpYy
What You
(warms up)
Sorry Put er there pal

Woody uses his free hand to shake with Bullseye

BULLSEYE

Yep just like you I was The
birdman of Al’s apartment Fifty
four escape attempts at the window
hundred and twenty seven at the air
vent and

(proudly)
two hundred and eighty four attempts
to lasso the doorknob like you’re
doing I’ve been here a long time
Woody and if there’s one thing
I’ve learned it’s that

Woody tosses the lasso up to the doorknob CLICK Woody
brightens and pulls hard on the door It doesn’t open and WHAM
Woody yanks himself headfirst into the door

BULLSEYE
--that door’s deadbolted

WOODY
(deadpan)
Thanks

BULLSEYE

Woody don’t be a darn fool I
spent years wishing I could break
out and all I got was a broken heart

(perks up)
Besides life here ain’t that bad
Al treats us well Prospector and
Senorita Cactus they’ve got
their good points

WOODY
What good points

BULLSEYE

(thinking hard)
Er They’re very shiny The
cactus isn’t that prickly The
Prospector has good diction

(defensive)
Well it could be worse I could
still be stuck in that moldy box
———-—

Woody sits down despondent He’s staring up at something

BULLSEYE
Yep the more I tried to escape
the more I learned that you don’t
escape from Al’s

WOODY
Bullseye What do you know about
that skylight up there

BULLSEYE
I know that you’ve got some
learnin’ to do Good luck friend

Bullseye smiles at Woody walks away

across the street In the middle is Al’s Toy Barn

REX

Rex doesn’t look both ways he just excitedly starts running
across the road

Buzz watches Potato Head Hamm and Slinky dash madly across the
road Now Buzz is stranded on the side of the highway He grits
his teeth in frustration From the other side of the road he
hears

SLINKY
Come on over

POTATO HEAD
What are you waiting for

Buzz starts across the road Halfway there he looks up and sees
a Buick heading straight for hin

Buzz freezes not knowing what to do As the car WHOOSHES by
its curb feeler KNOCKS Buzz to the pavement

Buzz staggers up looks at his leg

BUZZ
Whuh -

Buzz is mortified to see the curb feeler’s scratched a scuff mark
deep into his leg He gets up to move but a line of cars whiz by
in both directions

celebrating After a beat he trudges toward Al’s Toy Barn a
defeated toy

INT AL’S APARTMENT - DISPLAY ROOM - LATER

Woody has stacked a bunch of Woody’s Roundup paraphernalia--
lunchboxes board games bookbags thermi books etc--into a
very rickety stack leading to the skylight Woody is climbing
carrying a book Woody’s Book of Phonics

Bullseye watches as Woody climbs higher and higher The
Prospector and Senorita Cactus are playing chess their backs to
Woody They don’t see the escape attempt

Woody reaches the top The skylight is right above his head
Woody places the book on top Now the stack reaches right up to
the skylight

WOODY
(sotto as he climbs)
Hah No one’s ever escaped Al’s

That was before Al messed with ne

Woody hops on top of the book pushes against the skylight It
wont budge

WOODY
(panicky)
No no This can’t be happening

Woody POUNDS on the skylight The stack starts to quake
Bullseye runs for cover as the bottom falls out The stack
topples over with a CRASH sending Woody flying

The Prospector and Senorita Cactus are startled They look up
from their game see Woody staggering out of the pile in a daze

PROSPECTOR
Not another escape attempt How
tedious

SRTA CACTUS
I‘1l say one thing for him he’s
got guts
(pause)
I hate guts

PROSPECTOR
Senorita we‘’ve got to find a way
to break him

SRTA CACTUS
Break him He’1ll be worth a lot
less if we do that

PROSPECTOR
I mean his spirit As long as he
pines for

But I oh prickly one have a
devilish idea

Lisa and Ming vases are antiques
People treasure them

WOODY
Andy treasured me

SRTA CACTUS
How quaint That’s what Bullseye
thought

PROSPECTOR
Bullseye why don’t you tell Woody
about when you were played with

away embarrassed

PROSPECTOR
I know why He’s too ashamed He
had a little boy just like your
Danny fellow

WOODY
Andy

PROSPECTOR

«and you know what he did He
threw our poor poor Bullseye away
One day in 1959 his dad brought
home a hula hoop The kid got
hooked and Bullseye

(melodramatic)
was never played with again

Bullseye hangs his head slinks away

SRTA CACTUS
Didn’t you say Danny or whatever
his name is had a video game

PROSPECTOR
Oh my friend it’s already over
Video games are the hula hoops of
the nineties Soon he’ll discover
comic books rock and roll and
finally

Senorita Cactus bats her eyelashes in a flirtatious way She
mimics a kiss

SRTA CACTUS
You’re already history man

WOODY
(despairing)
I don’t want to hear any more

The Prospector smiles puts his arm around Woody

PROSPECTOR
Yes Cactus enough of your
depressing drivel dravel Woody
needs some good news

The Prospector opens up a large book titled Collectible Toy Blue
Book He peers inside the book

PROSPECTOR
Here you go Woody you’re up
fourteen percent this month

wooDy
What are you talking about

SRTA CACTUS
Nothing that concerns a mere toy
like yourself We’re looking you
up in the price guide

WwooDY
What price guide

PROSPECTOR
The collectible toy price guide
But you wouldn’t want to see how
much you’re worth It’d be too
great a shock
aaeN

WOODY
(interest slightly piqued)
Let me see

PROSPECTOR
Well if you’re sure you can handle
it I guess so

He holds the book up to Woody’s face Woody peeks inside

WOODY
I’m worth that much

PROSPECTOR
Oh no my good man that’s without
your hat With your hat you’re
worth this much
(points)

wooDYy
Pull my string

Woody can’t speak His head reels his hat falls off The
Prospector and Senorita Cactus jump for the hat

PROSPECTOR
(snaps fingers)
Cactus fluff the man’s pillows

Senorita Cactus rushes over with Woody’s pillow fluffs it
Woody leans back on it stares at his price in the price guide
Woody shows a slightly bemused smile The Prospector and Cactus
grin devilishly at each other

Woody goes back to the merchandise on the floor blankly stares
at it looks at the skylight and SIGHS picks up the merchandise
and puts it back on the display

EXT AL’S TOY BARN - NIGHT

Rex Potato Head Hamm Slinky and finally Buzz arrive outside
the electric eye door‘to Al’s Toy Barn They run from the spot
that activates the door to the door itself but it closes on
them

They finally leave Slinky’s back end at the activation spot The
door opens the toys slip in and they yank Slinky quickly
through the closing door
INT AL‘S TOY BARN - CONTINUOUS

A giant toy supermarket The lights are dimming They hear
footsteps

REX
Where do we hide Where do we
hide

SLINKY

What do you mean “where do we
hide It’s a toy store

They fall limp as a SECURITY GUARD passes and exits the building

GUARD
(calls)
I’m locking up Good night Al

The guard turns the main lights off and exits The toys scope

the place there’s no one around Al’s huge Toy Barn is a world

unto itself The shelves are skyscraper size the lights above
are like stars It’s dark and creepy Everyone looks up
awestruck at the shelves of lifeless toys in boxes

SLINKY
This place is giving me the
willies

REX

You think Woody’s up there I hope
we don’t have to open all those boxes

SLINKY
Al sure has a big bedroom

HAMM
What are you talking about This
isn’t his bedroom That’s his
bedroom

Hamm points to an ajar office door that reads President’s
Office There’s a light coming from the office

REX
I bet he’s in there with Woody
playing cowboys and indians

Rex Potato Head Hamm and Slinky rush toward the office door
Buzz stays behind staring awestruck up at an aisle

AT AL‘’S OFFICE DOOR

Rex Potato Head Hamm and Slinky hide behind the door and peek
through the crack Inside Al is on the phone By the door sits
Al‘’s open duffel bag

AL
(into phone)
Of course it’s the authentic first
edition Woody I’11 see you at my
condo at five thirty Bring your
checkbook

SLINKY
(sotto)
He doesn’t live here Woody’s
miles away

Rex grabs a plastic dart gun and some suction cup darts off the
nearby shelf

REX
(sotto)
Let’s kidnap Al Give him a taste
of his own medicine

HAMM
(sotto)
We can’t use that Get rid of it

REX
(sotto)
But it’s so pretty

POTATO HEAD
(sotto)
Shh I’ve got it all figured out
We get into that bag and I bet
tubby brings us right home to
Woody Any problems with my plan
Buzz Buzz

POTATO HEAD
Now where’d that spaceman get to

Buzz isn’t with then

ANGLE ON BUZZ

Buzz is awestruck by an aisle full of Buzz Lightyears They
closely resemble Buzz except these are newer flashier models
labeled Ultra Buzz Lightyear 2000
“

Buzz looks up at hundreds of identical Ultra Buzz Lightyear
2000s He sees one on display out of his box This new Buzz is
shinier fancier and has even more buttons than our Buzz

Curious our Buzz climbs up onto the display and sizes up the new
Buzz He’s about to press one of the new Buzz’s buttons when

ULTRA BUZZ
Halt

Ultra Buzz grabs our Buzz’s index finger

BUZZ
(recoils)
HO-YAAAHH
ULTRA BUZZ

You’re in direct violation of code
zero section seven dash B stating
all space rangers are to be in
hypersleep until awakened by
authorized personnel

Ultra Buzz points to the aisle of Buzzes in their boxes

BUZZ
(realizes)
Oh no
ULTRA BUZZ

You’re breaking ranks Ranger You
could jeopardize the entire
mission

Our Buzz rolis his eyes He mouths along as Ultra Buzz proudly
speaks

ULTRA BUZZ
Right now poised at the edge of
the galaxy Emperor Zurg has been
secretly building a weapon with the
destructive capacity to annihilate
an entire planet I alone have
information that reveals this
weapon’s only weakness

Buzz stares at this Ultra Buzz seeing his own reflection in
Ultra Buzz’s helmet Ultra Buzz has the same deluded look in his
eyes that our Buzz had when he first landed on Andy’s bed

For a moment Buzz considers whether he should say anything

BUZZ
Friend let me share a little
secret with you Space Ranger
you’re not a Space Ranger You’re
a toy

ULTRA BUZZ
Akkhh yYou’ve been brainwashed by
agents of Zurg

BUZZ
(pops open his wings)
Our wings they’re plastic And
our lasers

Buzz hits his laser Ultra Buzz recoils doing a triple
handspring

ULTRA BUZZ
Has your mind been melded You
could have killed me Space
Ranger or should I say
traitor

Ultra Buzz puts his hand to his laser and points it menacingly at
Buzz

ULTRA BUZZ
(into wrist communicator)
Buzz Lightyear to Star Command
I’ve got an AWOL Space Ranger
Why don’t they answer

Buzz rolls his eyes starts to walk away Ultra Buzz is shocked
that Buzz walks away from a laser

ULTRA BUZZ
You’re coming with me for court
marshal

Ultra Buzz lunges at Buzz from the back They roll around on the
floor

They roll into the base of another display jostling it An
Emperor Zurg box falls off the display breaking open on the
floor An Emperor Zurg doll pulls itself out

EMPEROR ZURG
(cartoony villain voice)
Curses Crashed landed on a
hostile planet

Zurg turns and sees the Ultra Buzz His eyes light up
(literally)

EMPEROR ZURG
I’ve got you now Lightyear
Prepare to die
(cheesy evil laugh)

Zurg pulls an “ion ball blaster (actually an accessory filled
with tiny nerf balls) from his box attaches it to his back

ULTRA BUZZ
(to Buzz)
Take cover He’s got a Zurgotronic
Ion Blaster

Ultra Buzz pushes Buzz behind Zurg’s box Zurg begins shooting
the nerf balls at Ultra Buzz

As our Buzz watches the Ultra Buzz leaps into an acrobatic
frenzy avoiding the balls with backflips slides and high jumps
Buzz is impressed Ultra Buzz sees our Buzz stepping out to
help

ULTRA BUZZ
Stay covered You don’t believe
you’re a space ranger How can you
fight with that attitude

Ultra Buzz fires his grappling hook onto a low shelf and swings
over Zurg

ULTRA BUZZ
You’re powerless to stop me Zurg
A Space Ranger fears nothing

Buzz smiles He’s inspired by the deluded Space Ranger’s
confidence

BUZZ
Of course
(beat)
Step aside let a rea hero handle
this

Our Buzz confidently walks directly into Zurg’s stream of nerf
balls He LAUGHS as Zurg’s ion balls bounce harmlessly off his
chest

ULTRA BUZZ
What kind of superhuman are you

BUZZ
I’m not a human at all I’m a toy
A cool toy

Buzz walks cooly behind Zurg’s back and pulls out his batteries
Zurg’s ion blaster stops firing

EMPEROR ZURG
ITieeee My ion blaster’s rendered
useless

Zurg backs away cowardly Finally he throws the ion blaster gun
at Buzz then runs off Buzz smiles at the amazed Ultra Buzz

ULTRA BUZZ
You’ve smitten Zurg with nothing
but the sheer will to dominate
You are the Buzz Lightyear You
have a greater knowledge than I can
ever comprehend

Ultra Buzz and Buzz do the secret Space Ranger palm press It’s
a moment of macho male bonding

ULTRA BUZZ
I’m going to the Desert of Neptar
to meditate Perhaps someday I
will gain the confidence you
display Space Ranger

Ultra Buzz removes his accessory belt hands it to our Buzz

ULTRA BUZZ
I don’t know what you did with your
accessory belt but take mine
You’re more deserving of this Go
in peace

BUZZ
(to self)
Time to get Woody in the name
of the Universe Protection Unit

He bounds down the aisle finally his old self Behind him we
see Al walk by carrying his duffle bag

ON DUFFLE BAG
Rex Potato Head Hamm and Slinky are crammed inside They see

Buzz hasn’t noticed them Rex fires one of his suction cup darts
at a large ball on the shelf
)

ON BUZZ

The ball falls getting Buzz’s attention Buzz sees Al and then
Rex peeking out from Al’s bag

Buzz bounds toward the bag re-energized As Al walks through
the electronic door Buzz takes a flying leap catapults off the
ball and sails through the doors as they’re closing He lands
perfectly in the bag with a little THUMP Al looks around

AL
Gotta get those doors fixed

plaything

Woody pushes the retract button on Buz2’s grappling device and
Buzz goes shooting back up toward the skylight

wooDy
Have a nice trip spaceman

Just then we hear a SQUEAL OF GLEE from the front room Al runs
in holding a check He kisses it and pours himself a cocktail

ABOVE Buzz hears a SNAP from inside his grappling hook device
It’s broken Buzz panics as he falls straight for Al’s head
Buzz frantically BANGS on the broken grappling device He gives
up and tries to stop his fall by grabbing the rope Buzz rope-
burns his hands but manages to stop the fall--an inch above Al’s
head

BELOW Al holds his cocktail up gazes at Woody and raises a
toast

AL
A toast To the one who made it
all possible Me

Al tosses back his drink then picks up Bullseye The Prospector
and Senorita Cactus

INHALES as Al’s pudgy fingers barely miss him

Then Al grabs a packing box and packs Bullseye inside Emerson’s
voice comes from the living roon

the other one down

BUZZ

Woody runs away TRACK WITH WOODY as he suddenly jerks His
legs are spinning but he’s actually moving slowly backwards
Woody looks behind himself in horror

WIDEN TO REVEAL Buzz is holding the ring on the end of Woody’s

Woody is pulled backwards toward Buzz

Buzz removes Woody’s bandanna and gags Woody with it He drags
Woody to his waiting retractable string He climbs to the

roof Woody sees this his eyes go wide He flails about and
shouts

WOODY

loose and falls off the side of the building Buzz scrambles
back onto the roof He and Woody stand face to face on the roof

Buzz grabs Woody’s boot and shows him the name Andy

BUZZ
This is a badge of honor That
name on your boot means a kid loves
you That’s not something you can
erase

Woody looks at his boot with guilt “Andy” is faint but still
there

Just then the Prospector and Senorita Cactus emerge from the
skylight huffing and puffing up Buzz’s string

PROSPECTOR
See here you battery-operated
bourgeois bauble that’s ny

Woody incredulously mouths the word property

SRTA CACTUS

Buzz unties Woody Woody hesitates He doesn’t know what to do

PROSPECTOR

Woody starts to slink toward the skylight As Woody scratches
his head in confusion his hat falls off The wind picks it up
swirling it around in the air

SRTA CACTUS

(shrieks)
Your mint condition hand-laced hat
Catch it

Woody leaps for the hat but it flies over the side of the
building and lands precariously on the tip of a horizontal
flagpole The hat is dangling twenty stories above the street

WOODY
Oh great
(smiles at Buzz insincerely)
Buzz we both know I can’t risk
scuffing myself Be a chum and
fetch my hat

BUZZ
A Space Ranger doesn’t fetch If
being a museum piece is so
important ask one of your friends
to help you

Woody turns to the Prospector

PROSPECTOR
Surely you jest I’d ruin ny
finish Woody how could you be so
selfish

Woody considers then climbs out on the rickety flagpole He
inches his way toward the hat hanging high above the street
Just as Woody is about to grab it the hat blows off Woody

lunges for it but misses and loses his balance

PROSPECTOR
Noooo
(beat)
The hat

Woody grabs the end of the flagpole with one hand-and is left
hanging over the street He doesn’t have the hat

WOODY
Help

PROSPECTOR
Risk scuffing my sheen for a mere
‘Hatless Woody’ Well I never

SRTA CACTUS

worthless now Worthless

PROSPECTOR

Woody looks at them in shock His hand slips off the pole

WOODY

Woody falls Buzz springs into action jumping out onto the
flagpole and flipping like he did in Al’s Toy Barn He leaps out
to the end of the pole grabs Woody and brings him safely to the
roof

PROSPECTOR
Hmph Shouldn‘t have bothered

WOODY
Oh really

As Woody steps up to the roof we see the hat is caught on one of
his spurs Woody triumphantly puts the hat back on Woody
smiles

SLINKY

HAMM

The toys stack on top of each other Rex ends up on top but

Mr Potato Head removes his left arm and hands it up the stack to
Rex Now Rex has an arm extension Using Potato Head’s arm Rex
pushes all the buttons and the elevator starts rising

landing on their pillows The Prospector and Cactus grab onto
Woody’s boots trying to pull the group down

to bear The rope is slipping down

The knob to the display room door begins to turn

Thinking fast Woody reaches to Al’s cocktail cart and grabs a
plastic drink sword with a maraschino cherry on it He swings at
the Prospector The Prospector grabs a drink sword with an olive
stuck on it and the two duel

Buzz is losing his grip The toys are sliding back down Woody
furrows his brow lets go of the rope and falls on his pillow
