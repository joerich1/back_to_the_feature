Our clients here at Truman-Mann are
primarily Fortune 500 companies
Our job is to make frivolous
lawsuits disappear before they ever
make it to a courtroom

CLOSE ON GAYLE BUCKLEY 50 a partner at this prestigious law
firm someone Veronica might want to be in 20 years

GAYLE BUCKLEY
You were issued a private
investigator’s license on your
eighteenth birthday Is that
something California kids do

REVEAL VERONICA sitting across the conference table

VERONICA
My father is a PI I worked for
him It was more answering phones
and handling his travel than
anything else

As we cut back across the table we see that Buckley is
flanked by a pair of underling MALE LAWYERS

GAYLE BUCKLEY
Really Because your father directs
quite a bit of praise your way in
his book about the solving of the
Lilly Kane murder Before you
turned 20 your named popped up on
LexisNexis in

colleagues who has an open laptop in front of him

VERONICA
But that’s not me any more I
haven’t worked a case since I left
Neptune That’s been nine years

GAYLE BUCKLEY
And why’s that

Veronica takes a beat This ventures into personal territory

VERONICA
The price was too high It ruined
friendships and relationships It
cost me some opportunities along
the way But mostly it had to do
with my dad

GAYLE BUCKLEY
Your dad didn’t like you doing that
sort of work

VERONICA
He wasn’t crazy about it But
that’s not why I stopped My dad
was a great cop It was his
calling but because of how
consumed I became with a case
he’1l never get to be a cop again

LEONARD MARCH
(referencing screen)
This was when your father was

indicted

VERONICA
Yes After that I transferred to
Stanford

LEONARD MARCH
So your decision to transfer wasn’t
related to a certain video of you
and another Hearst student

VERONICA
The sex tape No need to be coy

Buckley shoots Leonard a quizzical look

GAYLE BUCKLEY
Leonard that’s hardly--

VERONICA

put in adversarial situations

Opposing council would seek to
exploit any perceived weakness
Leonard here is smartly determining
if this is one for me All I can
say is that the video was made and
distributed without my knowledge
It’s part of my past I would ask
you -- do I look ruffled

Buckley regards her male counterparts smiles wryly before
turning back to Veronica

GAYLE BUCKLEY
We have a backlog of work Once we
make our decision we’ll be looking
for someone who can dive right in

VERONICA
That won’t be a problem for me

A moment later VAPID TOOL clubs Weevil in the body with his
pimp cane The blow drops Weevil to his knees VAPID TOOL is
winding up for another blow when Piz flies in and tackles
him

A RING OF STUDENTS gathers around the fight just like in high
school fights It’s become a spectator event

Logan now free strikes a kung-fu pose and beckons his
opponents -- like Morpheus in The Matrix A furious ‘ROID
TALE charges Logan who uses ‘ROID TALE’s momentum to slam
him into the bar

09er 1 and 09er 2 converge on Logan get into his body and
begin delivering blows It becomes a traveling entanglement
of bodies

sighs takes a long pull on his flask and makes his way into

VERONICA
This is police photo of the boat
the morning Susan disappeared off
of it Notice anything

Logan and Dick stare at the photo Dick ventures a guess
DICK
The police photo is black and

white

Veronica shoots a withering look at Dick Then

LOGAN
The anchor

VERONICA
Exactly

DICK

I don’t see an anchor

VERONICA
Not in that one
(indicating computer)
Here’s where it normally goes

In the photo of Carrie and Susan the anchor is present

DICK
So

VERONICA

(frustrated intense)
So my first guess is that there’s
no anchor there because it was
used to make sure Susan Knight sunk
to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean
California has a death penalty
Dick so how about you act like you
give a damn about your friend and
tell me what happened that night

VERONICA
(stunned)
It’s Cobb She called Cobb for
help

LOGAN
Cats and dogs living together

Veronica shushes him Through the FM radio we hear Cobb and
Gia’s conversation as Veronica watches through her camera

I just got a call from an unknown
number and it was Carrie’s voice
saying these random things

VERONICA
No thank god

The radio gets a bit static-y for a moment

Veronica adjusts the dial on the radio

LOGAN
What’s going on

VERONICA
Dad had all the good listening
devices locked up I had to use the
old bugs that use FM radio signal
It’s a bandwidth at the end of the
dial no one uses -- 886

Veronica succeeds in locking in the frequency We hear what
sounds like Cobb “finishing”

VERONICA’S POV -- a white 8” tablet resting on a table

VERONICA (CONTD)
Was Carrie’s tablet one of the big
ones or a little one

LOGAN
A little white one

VERONICA
There’s one matching that
description on her table

LOGAN
She’d have to be stupid to keep--

VERONICA

behind me in Civics reading like

eye-fucking me and smelling like
old sponge He had quality drugs
though -- E blow acid He was our
go-to That night we went out on
the Carrie’s boat we tried to get
product from him but he insisted on
us taking him with We all got so
shit-faced it didn’t even matter
Then Susan as usual bottoms out
starts bawling about the baby she
gave up for adoption She
disappears below deck Carrie finds
her later barely breathing White
as a sheet Carrie begs us to sail
in to shore get Susan to a
hospital but Cobb said she’d sleep
it off that he’d seen it a hundred
times

VERONICA
And you believed him

GIA

We were out of our skulls and it
was just what we wanted to hear We
were picturing jail lost futures
lost fortunes We were dumb and
scared

(choking up)
Carrie went back to check on Susan
later and she was dead Full-on
dead There’s all this chaos and
drama It was Cobb’s idea to weigh
her down with the anchor We were
all sobbing trying pick her up and
lift her over the side of the boat--

VERONICA
Dick was sobbing

GIA
Dick passed out before any of this
happened He’s never known the
truth He sells the lie better than
