A Note on Period

The events occur in the latter 1790s The fashions could either be the attractive
traditional ones from the first part of the decade or the striking neo-classical
“Directoire” style which came in with the French Directory the transitional regime that
marked the ascension of the Napoleonic Era

Music and a local “Assembly” dancing sequence have not yet been indicated for this
draft The music of the period was especially brilliant and perhaps could be used
similarly to the classical score for “Barry Lyndon”

A Note on Tone

Rather than romantic Austen of the Sense and Sensibility sort this would be more
comic Austen somewhat akin to the Oscar Wilde adaptations — though still with lush
locations costumes and even some weddings The protagonist is Lady Susan Vernon
beautiful and charming the romantic puppet master who seeks (usually successfully) to
manipulate all around her Though not a conventional heroine played with the right
style and charm we hope she might be compelling as well as funny The period is closer
to that of Dangerous Liaisons than Austen’s later novels

Catherine Vernon describes Lady Susan

“She is really excessively pretty I have seldom seen so lovely a Woman as Lady
Susan She is delicately fair with fine grey eyes and dark eyelashes and from her
appearance one would not suppose her more than five and twenty I cannot help feeling
that she possesses an uncommon union of Symmetry Brilliancy and Grace Her address
to me was so gentle frank and even affectionate that if I had not known how much she
has always disliked me for marrying Mr Vernon I should have imagined her an
attached friend Her Countenance is absolutely sweet and her voice and manner
winningly mild I am sorry it is so for what is this but Deceit”

CATHERINE VERNON writes at her desk CHARLES VERNON her
husband approaches as the footman leaves

CHARLES (0S)
Catherine a letter--

Charles enters with a letter He is calm and bland he sits
CHARLES (CONTD)
--it seems Lady Susan will finally
visit

REGINALD DECOURCY Catherines brother enters in riding
clothes as if about to head out for a jaunt

CHARLES (CONTD)
In fact shes already on her way

CATHERINE
What

He gives her the letter which she starts to read

REGINALD
Lady Susan Vernon

Catherine nods

REGINALD (CONT’D)
Congratulations on being about to
receive the most accomplished flirt
in all England

CHARLES

You misjudge her Reginald
REGINALD

How so
CHARLES

Like many women of beauty and
distinction our sister-in-law has
been a victim of the spirit of
jealousy in our land

CATHERINE
It’s jealousy

CHARLES
Yes Like anyone Susan might be
capable of an action or remark open
to misconstruction but I cannot but
admire the fortitude with which she
has supported grave misfortunes

REGINALD
Excuse me -- I spoke out of turn

Catherine’s look is that he did not speak out of turn dogs
bark outside Charles leaves
CATHERINE
Why would Lady Susan who was so
well settled at Langford suddenly
want to visit us

REGINALD
What reason does she give

CATHERINE
(reading)
Her “anxiety to meet” me and to
“know the children These have
never concerned her before

Reginald finishes pulling on his riding gloves a reflective
look on his face as if anticipating the meeting

TITLE CARD ‘Edward Street London’

INT EDWARD STREET HOUSE -- DAY

ALICIA JOHNSON a pretty woman of fashion floats down the
hall as a doorbell sounds A servant opens the front door
revealing LADY SUSAN the beautiful young woman glimpsed
earlier Alicia hurries her inside

ALICIA
Susan Come - hurry

SUSAN
My dear such haste How curious
you are

ALICIA
Mr Johnsons carriage is about to
come into the street

SUSAN
(laughs )
Surely that must happen often

ALICIA
You didn’t receive my letter

SUSAN
Letter

ALICIA
Mr Johnson forbids my seeing you

SUSAN
Preposterous How can he “forbid”
ALICIA
By threatening the severest
punishment imaginable -- sending me

back to Connecticut

SUSAN
To be tarred-and-feathered

ALICIA
He now claims to have important
business at Hartford and threatens
to settle there if our connection
is not entirely severed

SUSAN
For what possible reason or
pretext

ALICIA

His former ward Lucy Manwaring
wrote to him

SUSAN
Did she

Alicia slips Lucy Manwaring’s letter from the desk drawer and
hands it to Susan as they both sit

SUSAN (CONTD)
A horrid woman

ALICIA
I know

SUSAN

Deranged If she were going to be
jealous she should not have married
such a charming man I recall
thinking as I approached Langford

(dramatically)
I like this Man pray Heaven no
harm come of it I was determined
to be discreet and I have been --
admitting no ones attentions but
Manwaring’s avoiding general
flirtation entirely Except for a
little notice bestowed on Sir James
Martin But if the world knew my
motive there it would honor me

ALICIA
Martin
SUSAN
Sir James Martin of Martindale
Vastly rich and rather simple

ALICIA
Ideal

SUSAN
Miss Maria Manwaring had set her
cap for him considering such an
income too large not to be shared
But with a little notice I detached
him and soon had him in love with
Frederica If my daughter were not
the greatest simpleton on earth
she’d be engaged to him now

ALICIA
What

SUSAN
She refused him A baronet with ten
thousand a year Its all so
provoking

ALICIA
But where will you live

SUSAN
Were there another place open to
me I would crawl there on my
knees the worst spot this side of
the ocean a Country Village
Churchill my brother-in-laws
seat Mrs Cross a gentlewoman in
straitened circumstances who will
come as my companion -- to pack
unpack that sort of thing As
there’s an element of friendship
involved I’m sure the paying of
wages would be offensive to us
both

EXT A COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

Lady Susan beautiful in travelling clothes rides a carriage
accompanied by her companion MRS CROSS

SUSAN
-My brother-in-law Charles
Vernon is very rich

(MORE)
SUSAN (CONTD)
Once a man gets his name on a
Banking House he rolls in money --
so it is not very rational for his
lady to begrudge the sums he has
advanced me

MRS CROSS
Decidedly irrational not rational
at all

SUSAN
I have no money -- and no husband --

-- but in one’s plight they say is
one’s opportunity Not that I would
ever want to think in opportunistic
terms

MRS CROSS
Certainly not Never

The COACHMAN turns to them and shouts

COACHMAN
Churchill coming into view your
Ladyship

Lady Susan looks to the distance An impressive ancient
castle appears from behind the greenery

SUSAN
Heavens What a bore

MRS CROSS
Yes decidedly boring

EXT CHURCHILL -- DAY

Crane shot as the carriage pulls into the drive before
“Churchill” as Charles and the young children descend the
steps to greet them Footmen help the ladies from the
carriage Lady Susan pays particular attention to little
Frederick

INT CHURCHILL MAIN HALL -- DAY

The butler WILSON exasperated leads a footman across the
hall

WILSON
Mrs Cross is a friend of Lady
Susan and should be in the
adjoining room
INT CHURCHILL SUSAN’S ROOMS -- DAY
Lady Susan enters as Mrs Cross unpacks her trunk

SUSAN
I have no reason to complain of Mr
Vernon’s reception but I’m not
entirely satisfied with his lady’s

MRS CROSS
No

SUSAN
Shes perfectly well-bred
surprisingly so but her manner
doesn’t persuade me that shes
disposed in my favour

A sympathetic look of agreement from Mrs Cross
SUSAN (CONT’D)

As you might have noticed I sought
to be as amiable as possible--

MRS CROSS
Exceptionally amiable In fact
entirely charming -- excuse me for
saying so--

SUSAN
Not at all -- its true I wanted
her to be delighted with me--

(disappointed)

--but I didn’t succeed

MRS CROSS
I cant understand it

Susan thoughtful recalls

SUSAN
It’s true I have always detested
her And that before her marriage
I went to great lengths to prevent
it Yet it shows an illiberal
spirit to resent for long a plan
which didn’t succeed

MRS CROSS
Decidedly illiberal Not liberal at
all
SUSAN
My opposing her marriage -- and
later preventing her and Charles
from buying Vernon Castle -- might

have given her an unfavorable
impression But I’ve found that
where there’s a disposition to
dislike a pretext will soon be

found
MRS CROSS

You mustn’t reproach yourself--
SUSAN

I shant -- the past is done My

project will be the children I
know a couple of their names
already and have decided to attach
myself to young Frederick in
particular taking him on my lap
and sighing over him for his dear
Uncles sake--

A knock on the door

SUSAN (CONTD)
Come in

Wilson enters

WILSON
Mrs Vernons compliments your
ladyship She asks if you and Mrs
Cross would join her for tea

SUSAN
With pleasure--

She exchanges a look with Mrs Cross
SUSAN (CONTD)
Mrs Cross would prefer her repose
but thank Mrs Vernon -- I will
join her directly

INT GOLD ROOM -- DAY

A footman crosses out while Catherine checks the tea setting
the sounds of children come from off-screen
SUSAN (0S)
Yes Frederick I see you have
quite an appetite you will grow
tall and handsome like your uncle --
and father

LITTLE CHARLOTTE VERNON (0OS)
Frederick be good

Catherine smiles and approaches them

LITTLE CHARLOTTE VERNON (0OS)
(CONTD)
Frederick don’t touch that

CATHERINE
Frederick be careful

The off-screen clatter of metal objects

CATHERINE (CONT’D)
I’m so sorry

From off Susan laughs then enters with a gash of red jam on
her dress

SUSAN
Not at all Such a family
resemblance -- it rather moves me

CATHERINE
You’1l want to change

Susan covers the mark with a napkin and smoothly sits

SUSAN
Oh no -- let’s have our tea while
it’s warm Mrs Cross is a genius
with fabrics

Catherine serves the tea Susan takes her cup

CATHERINE
Are you sure

SUSAN
Oh yes How much Frederick reminds
me of his dear uncle

CATHERINE
You think theres a resemblance

SUSAN
Yes remarkable -- the eyes
Catherine considers this

CATHERINE
Weren’t Frederick Vernons eyes
brown

SUSAN

(using her hand)
I refer to the shape and slope of
the brow

CATHERINE
Oh

SUSAN
I must thank you for this visit --
Im afraid the short notice must
have come as a surprise

CATHERINE
Only because I understood you to be
so happily settled at Langford

SUSAN

It’s true -- Lady Manwaring and her
husband made me feel welcome But
their sunny dispositions led them
often into society I might have
tolerated such a life at one time
but the loss of a husband such as
Mr Vernon is not borne easily To
stay with you here at your
charming retirement--—

(she looks around)
--became my fondest wish

CATHERINE
I was glad to have the chance to
meet

SUSAN

Might I confide something
Catherine nods

SUSAN (CONTD)
Langford was not ideal for my
daughter Her education has been
neglected for which I fault myself
-- Mr Vernons illness prevented
my paying her the attention both
duty and affection required

(MORE)

SUSAN (CONTD)
I have therefore placed her at the
excellent school Miss Summers
keeps

CATHERINE
I trust Frederica will visit soon

SUSAN
A visit as delightful as that
might be would represent so many
days and hours deducted from the
“Grand Affair of Education” And
I’m afraid Frederica can’t afford
such deductions

CATHERINE
But shell come for Christmas--

SUSAN
Alas no Miss Summers can only
give her the concentrated attention
she needs then

Susan puts down her cup and glances at the jam stain

CATHERINE
I’m so sorry--

SUSAN
Not at all If you’ll excuse me
Ill give it to Mrs Cross who
once rested craves activity

She gets up

SUSAN (CONTD)
Once she’s applied her genius to it
all trace of little Frederick’s
interesting design will disappear

Susan leaves Catherine is left looking pensive

INT LADY SUSAN’S ROOMS CHURCHILL -- DAY

While Mrs Cross works on the dress stain Lady Susan reads
correspondence

SUSAN
The fees at Frederica’s school are
far too high to even think of
paying So in a sense it’s an
economy

EXT CHURCHILL FORECOURT -- LATE AFTERNOON
Reginald arrives at a trot and dismounts his horse held by a

retainer Removing his gloves he bounds up the front steps

INT HALLWAY TO GOLD ROOM CHURCHILL -- LATE AFTERNOONEARLY
EVENING

Catherine with Reginald as he shakes off the cold servants
light candles

REGINALD
I confess to curiosity to know
this lady and see first-hand her
bewitching powers Is she as
beautiful as they say

CATHERINE
You worry me Reginald

REGINALD
Don’t I understand Lady Susan
possesses a degree of captivating
deceit which might be pleasing to
detect

CATHERINE
You truly worry me

SUSAN (0S)
Good evening

Lady Susan and Mrs Cross enter from the garden or hallway
weather dependent Reginald and Catherine are struck
momentarily silent

SUSAN (CONTD)
What charming expressions

Catherine recovers first

CATHERINE
Susan let me introduce my brother
Reginald DeCourcy Reginald may I
present Frederick Vernon’s widow
Lady Susan and her friend Mrs
Cross

After a polite nod to Mrs Cross Reginald addresses Susan

REGINALD
Delighted to make your
acquaintance Your renown precedes
you

SUSAN
(long pause coolly)
I’m afraid the allusion escapes me

REGINALD
Your reputation as an ornament to
our Society

Susan pauses a moment to collect her thoughts

SUSAN
What you say surprises me Since
the great sadness of my husband’s
death I have lived in nearly
perfect isolation To better know
his family and further remove
myself from Society I came to
Churchill -- not to make new
acquaintance of a frivolous sort
But of course I’m pleased to know
my sister’s relations

MONTAGE with period music -- First beautiful wide landscape
view Lady Susan and Reginald walk their horses after a ride
then another time they walk in the garden And are observed
doing so Mrs Cross pauses from attending to Susan’s
wardrobe to look down upon them in the garden

INT CHURCHILL SUSAN’S ROOMS -- DAY
Susan who returns in outdoor clothes pulling off her gloves
Mrs Cross -- still pleased to take care of Lady Susan’s
rooms and wardrobe -- warmly greets her

MRS CROSS

I take it you are finding Mr
DeCourcy’s society more agreeable

Susan doesn’t disagree -- thinking

SUSAN
To some degree At first his
conversation betrayed a sauciness
and familiarity which is my
aversion -- but since I’ve found a
quality of callow idealism which
rather interests me

(MORE)

SUSAN (CONTD)
When Ive inspired him with a
greater respect than his sisters
kind offices have allowed he might
in fact be an agreeable flirt

MRS CROSS
He’s handsome isn’t he

Susan considers

SUSAN
Yes In a calf-like way -- not like
Manwaring of course But there’s a
certain pleasure in making a
person pre-determined to dislike
instead acknowledge ones
superiority How delightful it will
be to humble the pride of these
pompous DeCourcys

INT PARKLANDS -- DAY

The distinguished Sir Reginald DeCourcy walks through the

LADY DECOURCY
A letter

SIR REGINALD
From Catherine

LADY DECOURCY
I hope shell arrive soon

Lady DeCourcy takes the letter from him she has the sniffles
from a cold

LADY DECOURCY (CONT’D)
The season’s cheerless without the
children

Having trouble reading the letter she puts it aside

LADY DECOURCY (CONT’D)
Im afraid this cold has affected
my eyes

SIR REGINALD
Save your eyes my dear - Ill read
for you

LADY DECOURCY
No thats all right--

SIR REGINALD
I insist

Sir Reginald starts to read a moment to himself then aloud

SIR REGINALD (CONTD)
Alright now let’s see--
(reading and paraphrasing)
Catherine hopes you are well
She asks most particularly that you
give me her love

He looks to her expectantly

LADY DECOURCY
Yes and

Sir Reginald continues reading mumbling a bit as he does

SIR REGINALD
Reginalds decided to stay at
Churchill to hunt with Charles He
cites the “fine open weather”

He looks out the window

SIR REGINALD (CONT’D)
What nonsense The weather’s not
open at all

LADY DECOURCY
Maybe it is there or was when she
wrote
(sweetly)
My dear could you just read

SIR REGINALD
Verbatim

LADY DECOURCY
Yes the words - some of
Catherine’s voice will be in them
SIR REGINALD
Ill read each word comma and dash
if thats what you wish Here I
grow deeply uneasy (comma) my
dearest Mother (comma) about
Reginald (comma) from witnessing
the very rapid increase of her
influence (semi-colon) --

LADY DECOURCY
Just the words please

SIR REGINALD
No punctuation at all All right
much easier He and Lady Susan are
now on terms of the most particular
friendship frequently engaged in
long conversations together Lady
Susan

LADY DECOURCY
Yes Lady Susan has been visiting
Churchill

SIR REGINALD
Lady Susan Vernon

LADY DECOURCY
Yes

SIR REGINALD
How could Reginald engage in
conversations with Lady Susan
Vernon Conversations which are
“long” What would they talk about

LADY DECOURCY
My eyes have definitely cleared --
I’1ll read it myself Dont trouble
yourself

SIR REGINALD

No no if my son and heir is
involved with such a lady I must
trouble myself

(reading)
“How sincerely do I grieve she ever
entered this house Her power over
him is boundless She has not only
entirely effaced his former ill-
opinion but persuaded him to
justify her conduct in the most
passionate of terms”

Sir Reginald puts down the letter

SIR REGINALD (CONT’D)
Well I must go--

LADY DECOURCY
No - Ill write--

SIR REGINALD
No no if this is happening
there’s no time
Sir Reginald heads off to prepare

REGINALD
Father

SIR REGINALD
Good afternoon

REGINALD
How extraordinary for you to be
here

Sir Reginald stands by the fire very reserved

REGINALD (CONTD)
You are in good health I trust
How is Mother

Sir Reginald continues silently by the fire

REGINALD (CONTD)
What brings you here

SIR REGINALD
I won’t dissemble and say I have
business in this district -- what
I’ve come about is more important

REGINALD
What’s of such importance
SIR REGINALD
I know young men dont admit
inquiry into affairs of the heart
But as the sole son of an ancient
family you must know that your
conduct is most important to us --
your happiness ours the credit of
our family name its very survival--

REGINALD
But Father--

SIR REGINALD
No no hear me out I know you
would not deliberately form an
engagement without informing us but
I cannot help fear that you’ll fall
into an obligation which everyone
near you must oppose

REGINALD
What do you mean Sir

SIR REGINALD
Lady Susan Vernons age alone--

REGINALD
Father you astonish me

SIR REGINALD
What surprises you

REGINALD
Imputing such ambitions to Lady
Susan She’d never think of such a
thing even her enemies grant her
excellent understanding My sole
interest has been to enjoy the
lively conversation of a superior
lady But Catherine’s prejudice is
so great-—-

SIR REGINALD
Prejudice Lady Susan’s neglect of
her late husband her extravagance
and dissipation her encouragement
of other men were so notorious-—-

REGINALD
These are vile calumnies -- I could
explain each but will not so
dignify them I know you spend
little time in Society--

None

SIR REGINALD

REGINALD

Should you have frequented it more

youd

know the astonishing degree

of vile hateful jealousy in our
country--

SIR REGINALD

Do not deprecate our country Sir

I can’

t prevent your inheriting the

family estate and my ability to
distress you during my life is not
the kind of revenge that I would
choose to take--

REGINALD

Father this is unnecessary--

SIR REGINALD

No no let me continue A
permanent connection between you
and Lady Susan Vernon would destroy

every
would
pride

comfort of our lives It
be the death of the honest
with which weve always

considered you-- we’d blush to see
you to hear of you to think of

you

REGINALD

Father with the utmost humility
let me say that what you imagine

is

impossible

SUSAN

Poor Mrs Cross was obliged to
accept a position in
Buckinghamshire

(MORE)

SUSAN (CONTD)
As there was an element of
friendship between us I realized
the paying of wages would be
offensive to us both

CHARLES

You value friendship highly
SUSAN

Yes I hope I was of some help to

her
Charles separating one letter from the others

CHARLES
Your friends dont neglect you

Some distance away Reginald pretends to be reading a book of
Cowper’s poems but his attention is all on Susan as she takes
the letter expectantly

SUSAN
Thank you Charles

Looking at the envelope

SUSAN (CONTD)
Oh its from Fredericas school

As Charles moves off she finds a letter opener slits open
the envelope and begins to read her face falls

SUSAN (CONTD)
No

Agitated she sits and continues to read - Reginald goes to
her

SUSAN (CONTD)
I cant believe it It defies

comprehension
REGINALD
What
SUSAN

Frederica has run away
Run away from school

REGINALD
Heavens -- where to

SUSAN
They dont know

REGINALD
Shes lost
SUSAN
No -- they detected her plan early

enough to intercept her But what
folly Where could she have thought
of going

REGINALD
Surely here

SUSAN
No this is the last place shed
come I mean rather--

REGINALD
But she must miss you terribly--

SUSAN
Certainly -- I just don’t think
Churchill would be her object

Susan continues reading the letter -- then reacts

SUSAN (CONTD)
This is outrageous Miss Summers
requires that Frederica be removed
from school No This will not
stand Perhaps Miss Summers is
under the impression that as a
widow without fortune I may be
bullied Shes evidently forgotten
Frederica is a Vernon

Lady Susan stands and looks out the window in agitated
thought

SUSAN (CONTD)
Charles must put this right
Confronted with his imposing worth
even the mistress of a school must
be persuaded to act rightly

EXT COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY

INTEXT STATELY ARCADE -- DAY

Lady Susan walks with Alicia Johnson in the elegant setting

SUSAN
I had no notion of Frederica being
so contrary -- she seemed all
Vernon milkiness -- but it confirms
the rightness of my plan Did Sir
James call

ALICIA
Several times

SUSAN
Excellent

ALICIA
I followed your instructions
scolding him roundly for making
love to Maria Manwaring -- he
protested that it had only been in
joke You are right hes
wonderfully silly

In view across the courtyard an ARISTOCRATIC MAN followed by
a footman has noticed the ladies and slowly approaches them
They continue walking Susan reflecting

SUSAN
But we can’t let Sir James forget
with whom he’s in love -- a man so

rich and foolish will not remain
single long

ALICIA
Sir James is so far from having
forgotten the Vernons I’m sure he
would marry either of you in an
instant

Susan smiles and nods a non-verbal “thank you”

SUSAN
I must go back to Churchill -- but
I might need your help finding
another school should Miss Summers
not take her back Under no
circumstance will I have her at
Churchill

ALICIA
Very wise

SUSAN
What do you mean

ALICIA
The nearness of their ages

Susan looks confused

ALICIA (CONTD)
Her and Reginald’s

As the implication dawns Susan is displeased

SUSAN
How unkind

ALICIA
Forgive me

SUSAN
(suddenly sunny)
Forgiven The Fallacy of Youth
Isn’t it rather clear we women of
decision who hold the trumps

ARISTOCRATIC MAN

Lady Susan turns slow-basting the man with a scathing look

SUSAN
How dare you address me Sir

The ARISTOCRATIC MAN looks stunned

ARISTOCRATIC MAN
But Lady Susan--

SUSAN
Be gone Sir Or I will have you
whipped

The man turns and slinks away shame-faced

ALICIA
Outrageous You had never seen him
before

SUSAN

Oh no I know him well I would
never speak to a stranger that way

Alicia considers this and nods

EXT CHURCHILL GARDENS -- DAY

SUSAN
I hope that you might soon know my
friend Alicia -- she’s an American

from the Connecticut branch of the
Delancey family Although even the
best-bred Americans don’t sound
particularly “fine” there’s a
freshness to her manners which I
find rather tonic Her family were
treated outrageously there in the
late war punished for their very
loyalty to the Crown Americans
have shown themselves to be a
nation of ingrates -- only having
children can one begin to
understand such a dynamic

REGINALD
Yes

INT CHURCHILL GROUND FLOOR ROOMS -- DAY

Catherine Vernon carrying an envelope searches the rooms
finally finding whom she seeks entering the Gold Room from
the garden direction

CATHERINE
Susan I’ve been looking for you --
the afternoon coach brought this
note Perhaps Charles has succeeded
with Miss Summers

Susan opens the note and reads a few lines

SUSAN
Oh its as I feared Miss Summers
refuses to keep Frederica -- she

says she must think of her schools
reputation--

REGINALD
Preposterous I never heard of her
school

The sound of arrivals come from the front of the house

INT CHURCHILL HALLWAY -- DAY

approaches

Welcome Frederica Weve longed
to know you My brother

REGINALD
Hullo Pleased to meet you

Frederica bows to all but finally is left facing her mother

Good afternoon Frederica

(voice breaking)
Good afternoon Mother

Looking at her mother Frederica bursts into tears and runs
from the room
SUSAN
Excuse me Its as I feared -- I

must go to my daughter

REGINALD

Poor mother of Frederica
CATHERINE

REGINALD

The daughter is I understand a
problem case

CATHERINE

lack of nourishment

EXT CHURCHILL GARDENS -- DAY

Susan and Reginald walk on a garden path he looks around

REGINALD

Where is Frederica
SUSAN

In our rooms practicing the

pianoforte
REGINALD

She practices quietly

They both listen for the notes -- Susan glances quickly back

SUSAN

Dont look -- Fredericas watching

us

REGINALD
Watching us

SUSAN
Yes at the window -- dont look

REGINALD
How odd To be spied upon

SUSAN

(laughs )
Thats the parents lot We bring
these delightful creatures into the
world -- eagerly happily -- but
before long they are spying upon
and judging us -- rarely favorably
Having children is our fondest wish
-- but in doing so we breed our
acutest critics A preposterous
situation -- but entirely of our
own making

She laughs

REGINALD
I marvel at your good humor

SUSAN

What alternative have we It’s the
way of the world We must accept it
with a smile

(she smiles)
Of course when the little ones are
very small theres a kind of
sweetness which partially
compensates for the dreadfulness
which comes after

REGINALD
You worry for Frederica’s future

SUSAN

I worry for her present

(laughs )
Fredericas neither pretty nor
accomplished with no conversation--
I say this with a mother’s love

(sincerely moved)
accepting that the responsibility
for securing her future rests with
me

She looks to Reginald with a sincere candid expression which
he returns

INT CHURCHILL DRAWING ROOM -- DAY

Catherine and Reginald are together

CATHERINE
She’s quite prettier than I ever
imagined

REGINALD

Pretty You think so

CATHERINE
Yes You don’t

REGINALD
No I’d not have said that In any
case beauty matters little it’s
vivacity and a lively intelligence
one looks for -- even from the
young

A commotion can be heard outside Catherine heads toward the
door but as she does a distraught Frederica bursts in

FREDERICA
Oh I’m sorry Excuse me--

Embarrassed to find Reginald there she stops

FREDERICA (CONTD)
I beg your pardon

CATHERINE
What is it my dear
FREDERICA
He’s here He’s come Sir James is
here
CATHERINE
Who
FREDERICA

Excuse me Im sorry--

Frederica leaves hurrying to her room a subdued Susan
enters with Sir James Martin

SIR JAMES
So sorry to come like this
(laughs )
I suppose you didnt expect me
(laughs )

Lady Susan is not amused she proceeds crisply

SUSAN
Catherine let me introduce Sir
James Martin Sir James my sister
in law Mrs Catherine Vernon and
her brother Mr Reginald DeCourcy

SIR JAMES
Hullo

THE OTHERS
How do you do

Sir James surprised by the question takes a moment to
consider it

SIR JAMES
Kind of you to ask Excellent
Truly very well thank you
Excuse my hurry in coming -- the
lack of notice beforehand et
cetera et cetera

(laughs )
Truth is I forgot to write -- then
it was too late Now Im here
(laughs )

Took the liberty of a relation
hoping soon to be one

He nods in the direction Frederica laughs the others are
silent Sir James turns to Lady Susan

SIR JAMES (CONTD)
I must say you looked surprised
(laughs )
You were astonished to see me No
Not Well thats how it looked

(laughs )
SUSAN
Yes I was astonished -- and still
am
SIR JAMES

(to Reginald)
An impressive establishment you
have here Sir My congratulations
Immaculate

SUSAN
Mr DeCourcy is Mrs Vernons
brother--

SIR JAMES
Very good

SUSAN
--its her husband Mr Vernon who
has Churchill

SIR JAMES
Churchill Thats how you say it
All-together that way
(very very quickly)

“Churchill”

(marvelling)
That explains a great deal I had
heard “church” and “hill” -- but

I couldnt find either All I saw
was a big house

(laughs )
Fine name “Churchill”
Marlborough right The general He
showed the French

(laughs to Catherine)
You must be very proud

REGINALD
No connection

SIR JAMES
But I believe I’ve heard it spoken
of
(to Susan)
I think you mentioned it --
“Churchill” -- yes I believe you
did but what I heard was “church”
and “hill” Couldn’t find them at
all Now I realize I was in mistake
but stand corrected Happens quite
a lot

Sir James lets loose a long and very silly laugh When it
ends Susan continues

SUSAN
Reginald would you be so kind as
to take Sir James to see Charles
Sir James youll find Charles well
versed in the advanced agricultural
methods in which you’ve taken such
an interest

Sir James thinks

SIR JAMES
Oh yes Advanced agricultural
methods -- very much so Collins

who supervises Martindale for me
speaks of them often The
landowner of the present day
must know all sorts of things --
that’s our role

(laughs )
Hullo Collins” -- I say -- “what
advanced methods have we today
Excellent

For a moment the others just regard Sir James with surprise

INT CHURCHILL SUSAN’S ROOMS -- LATE PM

Susan enters and tries to find her way in a darkened space
revealed to be a bedroom suite

SUSAN
--Oh there you are Were you
asleep

FREDERICA
No Mama

SUSAN

What then You were hiding from
me Please explain

FREDERICA
No

SUSAN
You’re a strange girl What were
you up to back there

FREDERICA
What

SUSAN
Rushing out before Sir James
entered the room

FREDERICA
I couldnt bear to see him

SUSAN
Couldnt bear What an ungenerous
manner of speech

Frederica doesn’t move or respond
SUSAN (CONTD)
Frederica dear Sir James Martin is
a kind-hearted young man whose only
offense seems to be
(with a sweet smile)
wanting to provide you a life of
comfort

She waits for a response but there is none

SUSAN (CONTD)
Have you nothing to say

Frederica shakes her head
SUSAN (CONTD)

Dear our present comfortable state
is of the most precarious sort We

dont live -- we visit We are
entirely at the mercy of our
friends and relations -- as we

discovered so painfully at
Langford Here you seem to have won
your aunts affection

(smiles again)
I think I served you well there
for I believe she would do anything
to spite me But such a dynamic
cannot continue forever

FREDERICA
But Mama--

SUSAN
“But Mama” I will not always be
here for you to contradict me If
the life of comfort Sir James
offers you is not to your taste
what will you do How will you

live
FREDERICA
I could teach
SUSAN

Teach Had you been more in school
you would not consider such a
thing Answer this When our Lord
wrote His Commandments which one
did he consider so important he put
it in the fourth position

FREDERICA
The fourth position
SUSAN
Yes the Fourth Commandment

FREDERICA
I know the Commandments -- but not
their order

SUSAN
That’s what comes of an irregular
education The Fourth
Commandment

FREDERICA
Thou shalt not

SUSAN
It’s not a “Shalt not” It’s a
“Shalt”

FREDERICA
“Thou shalt”

SUSAN
Had I not myself been present I
would wonder if you were actually
my daughter
(pause compassionate
look)
“Honor Thy Father And Mother”

FREDERICA
Im sorry Has anything I’ve done
dishonored you or Father

SUSAN
To “honor” means among other
things to listen with respect to a
parent’s sincere counsel

FREDERICA
But I do listen with respect Mama
It’s just that--

SUSAN
If you will not pay attention to me
perhaps you will to a larger
imperative the Law of the
Universe An offer as splendid as
Sir James’ is unlikely to come
again He has offered you the one
thing of value he has to give --
his income

(MORE)

SUSAN (CONTD)
I fear and reproach myself for
having shielded you for far too
long had I let you starve a little
bit more you would resist much
less

FREDERICA
But at school I was often hungry--

SUSAN
Evidently not hungry enough In any
case the starvation of the
schoolhouse is nothing like that of
the destitute Is that what you
want

FREDERICA
No I can see that Sir James is a
kind man and if it were not a
question of marriage I could like
him But marriage is for one’s
whole life--

SUSAN
Not in my experience Meanwhile I
must ask you not to speak to your
aunt or uncle about this matter --
or seek their interference in any
way I insist -- promise
Remember the Commandment

FREDERICA
Yes Mama

EXT GARDEN -- DAY
Susan and Catherine walk

SUSAN
Sir Jamess arrival and its
suddenness requires some
explanation You were not too
surprised I hope

CATHERINE
It was unexpected--

SUSAN
Yes certainly To me as much as
anyone Im afraid Sir James’ best
qualities are not immediately
apparent Certainly hes no
Solomon--

CATHERINE
Solomon

SUSAN
The wise king in the Bible who
had the idea of dividing the infant
disputed by two mothers in half or
in two I can’t recall the exact
wording

CATHERINE
Oh yes of course

SUSAN
So Sir James is no Solomon --
but how many suitors of great
wisdom is a young woman likely to
find today

CATHERINE
I dont know--

SUSAN
None And I must confess that at
times I wonder if such a quality is
even desirable in a husband

Catherine looks a bit surprised

INT CHURCHILL DINING ROOM -- NIGHT

VERY TIGHT ON very round very green peas -- a knife of fine
silver knocks them about a plate of fine china

SIR JAMES (0S)
How jolly

Sir James toys with them as Reginald Catherine Charles and
Frederica watch A pair of footmen stand against the wall

SIR JAMES (CONTD)
Tiny green balls

Sir James savors a forkful
SIR JAMES (CONT’D)
Mmm yes good tasting -- quite
sweet What are they called

REGINALD
Peas

SIR JAMES
Oh yes I knew that I recall now
I must get Collins to cultivate
them at Martindale Novelty
vegetable -- could make quite a
packet

INT HALLWAY OUTSIDE GOLD ROOM -- NIGHT (FILMED)

Charles Vernon catches Catherine for a word -- Sir James can
be seen circling Frederica in the Gold Room Reginald stands
by the fireplace pretending to read his Cowper volume

CHARLES
I’m enjoying Sir James’s visit His
conversation is lively he brings a
new angle to things What do you
think if I took him to see the
Fredericksville farm He’s
mentioned his interest in
agricultural methods

CATHERINE
Yes

EXT CHURCHILL THE BEAUTIFUL TOWER - DAY

INT CHURCHILL STAIRWAY -- DAY

The maid brings the Vernon children Charlotte and Frederick
down the stairs as Charlotte enjoins her little brother to be
good

LITTLE CHARLOTTE VERNON
Frederick you must try to be good
INT CHURCHILL FRONT HALL -- DAY (FILMED)
Overlapping with the children’s voices Frederica reads a
volume of Cowper’s poems by candlelight
EXT CHURCHILL THE GARDEN -- DAY (FILMED)
Reginald - vexed - joins Lady Susan walking in the garden

REGINALD (0S)
He’s utterly ridiculous
SUSAN
Certainly hes no Solomon but--

REGINALD
“Solomon”

SUSAN
The wise king from the bible I
know he’s not that But any man
navigating the cascades of romantic
courtship and occasionally falling
into those foaming waters is not
apt to appear at his best--

REGINALD
What

Susan walks away as if vexed then turns around

SUSAN
A simple word Reginald
“Comprehension” I admire your cast
of mind but you might not be
entirely sensible of the degree to
which you intimidate others --
particularly a young man over whom
youve every advantage of position
looks and character

REGINALD
Sir James Martin is a fool because
of me

SUSAN
Yes Around you he seems very
silly

REGINALD

He isnt silly around everyone
SUSAN

No
REGINALD

I believe hes given everyone the
same impression

SUSAN
They have only seen him around you

REGINALD
But you deny Sir Jamess
intentions toward you

SUSAN
Toward me

REGINALD
Hes clearly besotted with you

Susan laughs as if pleased and flattered

SUSAN
No its with Frederica hes
smitten

REGINALD

Thats not possible

SUSAN
He proposed to her

REGINALD
How could such a blockhead even be
allowed to court your daughter
It’s incomprehensible

SUSAN
This is the incomprehension of the
rich and easeful You can afford to
take the high ground and add
another layer to your pride If you
realized the full extent of
ridiculous manhood a young woman
without fortune must humor you
would be more generous to Sir
James

EXT HURST and WILFORD -- DAY

The hubbub of horses and attendants -- Alicia in travelling
clothes and Lady Susan walk between them

SUSAN
It’s so good of you to steal away

ALICIA
We can only meet through such
subterfuges -- Mr Johnson is
relentless I will not be sent back
to Connecticut

SUSAN
I don’t see he’d believe that
association with me would lower
your reputation

SUSAN (CONT’D)
But a question did Sir James
mention to you any plans to come to
Churchill

ALICIA
Heavens no What folly How did Mr
DeCourcy react

SUSAN
I had some gratification there At
first he observed Sir James with an
attention not untinged with
jealousy But it was impossible to
really torture him as I finally had
to reveal that Frederica was Sir
Jamess object Then he was all
astonishment Left to ourselves I
had no great difficulty convincing
him I was justified - I cant
remember the exact reasoning but it
was all comfortably arranged

ALICIA
So what’s your verdict on young
DeCourcy

SUSAN
Hes not stupid and has a good deal
to say but I cant help but look
with a certain contempt on the
fancies of a heart always doubting
the reasonableness of its emotions
I vastly prefer the generous spirit
of a Manwaring who deeply
convinced of one’s merit is
satisfied that whatever one does is
right

ALICIA
I know that no one really deserves
you but young DeCourcy might be
worth having

Susan ponders her dear friend’s advice

INT GOLD ROOM - DAY

Sir James seeking to charm Frederica interrupts her reading
as Charles Vernon and Reginald read nearby

SIR JAMES
Excuse me Frederica when I came
down this morning I couldn’t help
noticing that you were reading a
“book” Which “book” was that

FREDERICA
This volume of Cowper’s verse

Frederica shows the book which she had been trying to read

SIR JAMES
Cowper the poet He also writes
verse Most impressive

Reginald jumps in

REGINALD
Yes he’s versatile that way

SIR JAMES
So Frederica you read both poetry
and verse In this I believe you
take after your mother who knows
all sorts of things Just yesterday
she cited to me a story from the
Bible about a wise king This
reminded me of many such important
accounts one learns in childhood
Perhaps most significant in forming
one’s principles is that of the old
prophet who came down from the
mountain with tablets bearing the
Twelve Commandments which the Lord
taught us must be obeyed without
fail

REGINALD
The Twelve Commandments

CHARLES
(apologetically)
Excuse me I believe there were
only ten

SIR JAMES
Oh really Only have to obey ten
So which two to take off then I
would say the one about the Sabbath
-- I prefer to hunt

CHARLES
Well

SIR JAMES
After that it gets tricky Most of
the “shalt nots” -- don’t murder
don’t covet thy neighbor’s house
or wife --
(laughs )

-- one wouldn’t think of doing
anyway as they would be wrong
whether one is allowed to take them
off or not

Sir James glances to Frederica to see if his disquisition
might have impressed her

Card “Soon to be a relative Sir James Martin aids a
widow”

Oh hullo Good day

FREDERICA
Good day

REGINALD

Would you know where I might find
your mother

FREDERICA
I believe she’s gone out

REGINALD
Gone out

Frederica doesn’t reply

REGINALD (CONT’D)
Are you all right

Frederica her head plunged sharply down first nods -- then
freezes as if about to cry

REGINALD (CONTD)
What is it

Frederica cant reply

REGINALD (CONTD)
Tell me whats wrong

Frederica cant bring herself to speak

REGINALD (CONTD)
Please say
FREDERICA
Sir II do not know to whom I
can apply
REGINALD
What is it Please tell me
FREDERICA
I am sorry I shouldnt say
anything -- its that -- youre the

only one Mother might listen to

REGINALD
Why would you say that

FREDERICA
She pays no one such regard as she
does you except Lord Manwaring

REGINALD
What do you mean Manwaring
FREDERICA
(panics)
No -- I’m sorry -- it’s just that

of all people I thought Mother
would listen most to you

REGINALD
Let me understand this it’s that
you find Sir Jamess presence and
courtship of you unwelcome

Frederica nods

Frederica

Frederica
panics

REGINALD (CONTD)
If his presence here disturbs you
it is to Charles or my sister to
whom you should apply

in some torment does not immediately reply

FREDERICA
I - I promised Mother I would not

REGINALD
I don’t understand Why would you
promise that

realizing she has gone far is flustered and

FREDERICA
(in a tiny voice)
She required it

REGINALD
What did she require

Frederica freezes

REGINALD (CONTD)
What These silences are
vexing

FREDERICA
Mama forbade it

REGINALD
I dont understand

FREDERICA
I promised not to speak to my Aunt
and Uncle on this subject

REGINALD
For what possible reason

FREDERICA
It’s wrong of me to speak now If
I were not at my wits end I would

not have -- I cant marry Sir
James

REGINALD
To what do you object

FREDERICA
You must have noticed -- hes very
silly

REGINALD

But besides that

FREDERICA
Besides that

REGINALD
Yes I confess the first
impression I had of him was also
indifferent But don’t those
knowledgable of such matters
consider Sir James a good “catch”
or “match” or whatever it is they
say

REGINALD (CONTD)
A man of cheerful temperament
happy to devote a large income to a
wifes comfort

FREDERICA
Id rather work for my bread

But what could you do
FREDERICA
I could teach I could--
REGINALD
Teach
FREDERICA
Yes
REGINALD

You must have been very little in
school Tell me how did this
happen Your mother is a woman of
excellent understanding her
concern for you great -- though
wise and clear-eyed How could she
be so mistaken if you truly despise
Sir James

FREDERICA
I don’t despise Sir James I can
see his a kind man with good
qualities He is certainly
likeable and I would be free to
truly like him if he were a cousin
or a cousin’s cousin or a friend
or a friend’s friend or an in-law
or a step-something -- I just don’t
want to be married to him

Reginald stands

REGINALD
Come Tell me the particulars If
they are as you say I can’t for the
world imagine that your mother
would remain deaf to your wishes

INT CHURCHILL BLUE ROOM -- DAY

Catherine sorts through Christmas objects when Reginald
enters red-faced and agitated
REGINALD
Catherine Id like to thank you
for this visit

CATHERINE
Youre leaving

REGINALD
Yes I must

CATHERINE
Why

REGINALD

As you’ve said its important that
at this season one of us be with
our parents

CATHERINE
Youve just decided this now

REGINALD
Yes But before going I must ask
one thing I’d be grateful if you
could see justice is done
Frederica She’s a sweet girl who
deserves a better fate

CATHERINE
Im glad you now see her worth

REGINALD
Yes my eyes have opened to many
things

INT CHURCHILL PARLOR - DAY

FREDERICA
Aunt I did something very wrong--

CATHERINE
I’m sure not--

Catherine goes to her

FREDERICA

its my fault Mama will never
forgive me--

CATHERINE
Don’t worry If any of what you

intercede

INT CHURCHILL GOLD ROOM -- DAY
Lady Susan enters in a seemingly placid mood

SUSAN
Good afternoon Catherine That
cough of young Fredericks worries
me -- I have from London some of
Dr Preston’s excellent lozenges
Could you use some for the dear
boy

She hands Catherine the package

CATHERINE
Yes thank you

SUSAN
I’ve also a request Could you tell
me if it’s true that we will be
losing Mr DeCourcy today

CATHERINE
Yes it seems that we will

SUSAN
How remarkable When he and I
spoke barely an hour ago he
mentioned nothing of it

Susan looks into Catherine’s face to divine an answer
SUSAN (CONTD)
Perhaps he did not then know
himself

(a laugh)
Young men are so impetuous in their
resolutions--

CATHERINE
I wouldnt say Reginald is
impetuous--

SUSAN
Oh yes he is -- hes like other
young men that way Hasty in making
resolutions but just as quick to
unmake them Id be very surprised
if he were not to change his mind

and stay
CATHERINE
He seemed quite decided
SUSAN
(smiles)
We’ll see
(leaving)
Some strangeness also seems to be
affecting Frederica -- I believe

the girls actually fallen in love
with your brother the object

INT CHURCHILL CORRIDOR -- DAY
Wilson knocks at a door Reginald jacketless opens it

WILSON
Sir Lady Susan asks if she might
have a word with you She asked if
you would be so kind as to visit
her in her dressing room

INT CHURCHILL STAIRWAY -- DAY

Reginald dressed ascends the stairs a determined
expression on his face He knocks on the door

SUSAN (0S)
Come in

INT LADY SUSAN’S ROOMS CHURCHILL -- DAY

Reginald enters -- half sheepish half self-righteous For
long moment Susan says nothing

SUSAN
I beg your pardon for the liberty
of calling you here Sir but I’ve
just learned of your intention to
leave today Is that true

REGINALD
Yes it is

SUSAN
I entreat you not on my account
to shorten your visit by even an
hour

REGINALD
Well--

SUSAN
I am perfectly aware that after
what has passed between us it would
ill-suit either of us to remain in
the same house It’s I who should

go

REGINALD
No Why

Lady Susan raises her hand

SUSAN
My visit has already been
inconvenient for your family for
me to stay risks dividing a clan
affectionately attached to one
another Where I go is of little
consequence whereas your presence
is important to all

INT CHURCHILL UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY
A somber Reginald leaves Lady Susan’s rooms
SUSAN (0S)

It’s terrifying how close I came to
destruction

INT EDWARD ST HOUSE -- DAY
Susan has just arrived Alicia Johnson meets her in the hall

SUSAN
It all started with Frederica in
the grip of a madness of some kind
entreating Reginald to intercede on
her behalf -- as if I were some
unkind mother not wanting the best
for my child

They pass from the hall into the salon

SUSAN (CONTD)
Next Reginald appears at my rooms
with an expression of the utmost
solemnity to inform me of the
impropriety of allowing Sir James
Martin to court Frederica I tried
to joke him out of it but he
refused to be

ALICIA
Heavens is he really so pompous--

SUSAN
The pomposity I assume it’s his
disloyalty which outraged me If he
held me in true regard he would not
believe such insinuations in my
disfavour A worthy lover should
assume one has unanswerable motives
for all one does

ALICIA
Certainly--

Susan pauses continuing in a softer register

SUSAN
Scarcely an hour had gone by when I
learned Reginald was leaving
Churchill Something had to be
done condescension was necessary
though I abhor it I sent for
Reginald when he appeared he
seemed astonished at the summons
and looked as if half-wishing half-
fearing to be softened by what I
might say-- The outcome justifies
some portion of vanity my dear
for it was no less favorable than
immediate
A footman

ALICIA
You brilliant creature

SUSAN
So now I have many tasks I must
punish Frederica for her
application to Reginald punish him
for receiving it so favorably and
make myself serious amends for the
humiliations Ive been obliged to
undergo

ALICIA
Manwaring’s in town

SUSAN
Manwaring How is he the divine
man

ALICIA
Absolutely miserable about you and
jealous of DeCourcy -- to such a
degree I cant answer for his not
committing some great imprudence
such as following you to Churchill--

SUSAN
Heavens

ALICIA
I think I persuaded him from it
If you do follow my advice and
marry DeCourcy it will be
indispensable for you to get
Manwaring out of the way Only you
have the influence to send him
home

SUSAN
(thoughtful)
And by remaining in Town I’1l be
able to reward a long penance at
Churchill with a little welcome
dissipation

enters
FOOTMAN

Madam Lord Manwaring has arrived
and begs to be admitted

Alicia and Susan exchange a look Susan nods

ALICIA
Please ask him to wait

bent in meditation or prayer

CURATE (0S)
Miss Vernon It’s so good to see
you here

The affable young CURATE stands before her

CURATE (CONTD)
Might I help you

FREDERICA
Yes A friend was asking how in
accord with Christian teaching the
Fourth Commandment should be
honored

CURATE
The Fourth Commandment Yes --
“Remember the Sabbath day to keep
it holy”

FREDERICA
No I meant the Commandment “Honor
thy Father and Mother”

CURATE
Oh the Fifth Commandment -- my
favorite It’s the Church of Rome
that has it as the Fourth-- yes
the Fifth Commandment

(MORE)
CURATE (CONTD)
“Honour thy father and thy mother
that thy days may be long upon the
land which the Lord thy God giveth
thee” Beautiful profound -- I
believe one should apply this
sentiment of Gratitude and Loyalty
to every aspect of our lives We
are not born into a savage
wilderness but in a beautiful
mansion of the Lord that the Lord
and those who have gone before us
have constructed We must avoid
neglecting this mansion but rather
glorify and preserve it -- as we
should all of the Lord’s Creation
The superb Baumgarten has outlined
this aesthetic trinity as “Beauty”
“Truth” and “Good” “Truth” is the
perfect perceived by reason
“Beauty” by the senses and the
“Good” by moral will

Frederica looks greatly inspired by the Curate’s words

EXT CHURCHILL FORLORN PATH -- DAY

Frederica returning to Churchill encounters Reginald
returned from a ride He looks surprised

REGINALD
From where do you come

FREDERICA
Church

REGINALD

Why were you in church

FREDERICA
Well it is our religion

REGINALD
Yes but this time of day --
neither morning prayer nor vespers

Frederica dodging an explanation
FREDERICA
The sky had clouded over -- I was

sure there would be a downpour

REGINALD
There was

Reginald shakes some water from his clothes Frederica now
sees that he’s soaking wet water dripping from his clothes

FREDERICA
Oh you are quite drenched You must
get into some dry clothes

She moves forward protectively her hands touching him and
then withdraws them embarrassedly as if having touched a hot
surface

FREDERICA (CONTD)
Oh excuse me

INT MAIN HALL PARKLANDS -- NIGHT
Lady DeCourcy greets Catherine still in her travelling cloak

LADY DECOURCY
Dearest welcome

Oh mother

Embracing her and almost crying

LADY DECOURCY
What joy your letter gave us

CATHERINE
I wrote too hastily--

LADY DECOURCY
What

CATHERINE
I couldn’t imagine that every
expectation I had would be dashed
so quickly

LADY DECOURCY
You frighten me

CATHERINE
Poor girl -- her one chance to
break free Who knows what
punishment her mother will now
impose

LADY DECOURCY
But Reginald cant be blind to such
a lovely girl

CATHERINE
He’s become blind Reginald is more
securely Lady Susan’s than ever

LADY DECOURCY
Please dont tell your father - I
worry for his constitution

Sir Reginald appears from the hallway

SIR REGINALD
Tell me what

EXT EDWARD ST HOUSE -- DAY

Susan’s carriage arrives at Edward Street and she steps out
Alicia intercepts her from the front door

ALICIA
Susan Stop

Alicia runs down the stairs

ALICIA (CONTD)
Dreadful news - Mr Johnsons been
cured

SUSAN
How is that possible

ALICIA
No sooner had he heard you were in
London than he had a cure

SUSAN
Then could you do me the greatest
favor Could you go to Seymour
Street and receive Reginald there
I dare not risk his and Manwaring’s
meeting -- keep him with you all
evening if you can Make up
anything

EXT UPPER SEYMOUR STREET -- DAY
Reginald arrives in a carriage and steps out dodging a hole

in the pavement where workmen replace cobblestones He
approaches the stairs to Lady Susan’s building
INT UPPER SEYMOUR STREET SALON -- DAY
Reginald and Susan enter together

SUSAN
I’m sorry I wasn’t here to greet
you but didn’t I provide a charming
substitute

Reginald remains silent - evidently pouting

SUSAN (CONTD)
It’s strange You remain silent but
Mrs Johnson couldn’t stop singing
your praises

REGINALD
Excuse me

SUSAN
I fear Alicia has rather fallen in
love with you - it’s given me quite
a scare

REGINALD
Youre joking

SUSAN
But you did like her

REGINALD
Of course--

SUSAN
I so admire Alicia she has none of
the uncouthness one expects from
Americans but all of the candor
Her husband Mr Johnson is older
and rather disagreeable but a word
of complaint never drops from
Alicia’s lips Exemplary Only by
one’s friends can one truly be
known that Alicia is mine will I
hope help you think better of me

REGINALD
I already thought well of you

Susan thinks

SUSAN
You were not “plagued by doubt”

REGINALD
Some things disconcerted me That
you were not here that--

SUSAN
Please Reginald dont be severe --
I cant support reproaches

REGINALD
But--

SUSAN
No I entreat you I cant support
them My absence was to arrange a
matter so that we could be
together Im forbidden to say
more please don’t reproach me

REGINALD
Have you considered what I asked

SUSAN
I have and I believe our affairs
require a delicacy and caution
which in our candid enthusiasm we
have perhaps insufficiently heeded--

REGINALD
What do you mean

SUSAN
I fear our feelings have hurried us
to a degree which ill accords with
the views of the world

REGINALD
Im sure in time--

SUSAN
Perhaps with time but given the
poignancy of our feelings--

REGINALD
You no longer wish to marry

SUSAN
No no no All Im saying - or
hesitantly suggesting - is that we
postpone an open understanding
until the opinion of the world is
more in accord with our own
inclinations

REGINALD
When might that be

Susan considers the question

SUSAN
I would say we should let the
opinions of our friends be our
guide

REGINALD
That could mean never

SUSAN
No no Perhaps months I confess
that such delay is against all my
inclinations--

REGINALD
Then let’s--

SUSAN
No I can’t be responsible for
dividing your family

REGINALD
I thought we’d decided

SUSAN
I know such delays seem
insupportable especially when we
are both in London With
separations only those that are
also geographical can reasonably be
tolerated

REGINALD
What

SUSAN
Im sorry Reginald staying in
London would be the death of our
reputations We must not meet And
not to meet we must not be near
Cruel as this may seem the
necessity of it will be evident to
you

REGINALD
Where will you go
SUSAN
Of course it’s necessary that I
remain in London -- there are

arrangements I must make for us to
be together But on the contrary I
know your family craves your
company -- especially that elderly
gentleman to whom you owe so much
Id hate to be the cause of an
éloignement between you and your
father who - forgive me - might
not have long left

REGINALD
Theres no reason for worry that I
know of -- Father’s rather in his
prime

SUSAN

Oh thank Heavens So he’s not in
decline

REGINALD
He has the usual aches and pains
but is overall I believe in good
health In any case hed not want
any concern on that account - which
hed consider so much rubbish

SUSAN
Ah mortality Our mortality and
that of others -- but most
particularly our own -- is the
hardest and most implacable hand
life deals us I long to meet the
dear gentleman Of course its
natural that he would want to
ignore or minimize the cold sad
end that awaits us

REGINALD
Not at all Fathers a Christian
for whom the prospect of the end is
neither sad nor cold

SUSAN
Ah yes Well thank Heaven for our
religion -- so important in this

life and most especially in the
next

Reginald paces the room

REGINALD
Must we really wait I entreat you
to reconsider

INT EDWARD ST HOUSE -- DAY

A servant opens the door to Lady Manwaring crying and
“fretted thinner and uglier than ever” accompanied by two
servants including OWEN

ALICIA
Lady Manwaring

LADY MANWARING
(in tears)
Excuse me Im in such a state I
don’t know what to say Is Mr
Johnson at home
(close to sobbing)
I must speak with my guardian

ALICIA
Yes yes of course You poor dear
Ill let him know youre here

Alicia leads her into the salon and puts her head into the
library

ALICIA (CONTD)
Lucy Manwaring is here to see you

LADY MANWARING
(howling)
Mr Johnson

Lady Manwaring lunges into the library and disappears within

ALICIA
Yes please go in

LADY MANWARING (0S)
You must help You must help me
Manwaring’s left

Alicia closes the door but leans close to hear

MR JOHNSON (0S OR PARTIAL)
Dear Lucy please calm yourself
Here take a seat

LADY MANWARING (0S)
Hes gone -- with no intention of
returning
MR JOHNSON (0OS)
What exactly’s happened Please
tell me everything as best you
can

A footman enters the salon to announce a visitor

JOHNSON FOOTMAN
Madam Mr DeCourcy

Reginald enters

REGINALD
Oh good day

ALICIA
Mr DeCourcy

She is taken aback but approaches him

ALICIA (CONTD)
What a surprise to see you So kind
of you to call

REGINALD
I must thank you for last evening -
for setting matters right Lady
Susan has explained everything
Im ashamed to have spoken as I did
-- it was foolish of me--

ALICIA
No no not at all -- most
sympathetic

Alicia maneuvers to keep Reginald away from the library
which voices can still be heard

ALICIA (CONTD)
But you didnt have to come to
thank me -- courtesy did not
dictate it

REGINALD
In fact it’s not my sole motive --
Lady Susan has entrusted me with a
letter for you

Reginald hands her the letter

ALICIA
(reading)
“Strictly private” - how
intriguing

from

Lady Manwarings scarcely human high-pitched plaint is too

audible to ignore

REGINALD
Has an animal been injured

ALICIA
Amateur theatricals “Medea” --
They perform next week but prefer
not to be watched rehearsing

Alicia hurries Reginald toward the door

ALICIA (CONTD)
Thank you again for the charming
evening

Lady Manwaring bursts out of the library followed
Johnson -- Reginald too close to the door to see
unobstructed catches only glimpses of the drama

LADY MANWARING
She’s with him now This cant
continue It mustnt--

MR JOHNSON
Lucy please dont Stay here
rest recover your equanimity--

LADY MANWARING
Equanimity Theyre together now
(to Mr Johnson)
I implore you -- come with me
talk with Manwaring reason with
him As my Guardian wont you
help--

MR JOHNSON
Even if I found them what good
could be done

Alicia has returned partway to the room
ALICIA
Yes heed Mr Johnson in such
matters his counsel is excellent--
LADY MANWARING
What have you A letter in her
hand

Lady Manwaring snatches the envelope from Alicia

by Mr
them

ALICIA
Return that letter Madam It is
not for you

Lady Manwaring tears it open

MR JOHNSON
Lucy no

Reginald snatches the letter holding it away from her

REGINALD
Excuse me Madam I believe you
were on the verge of making a grave
error You are Lady Manwaring
Lady Manwaring of Langford Youve
recognized your friend Lady Susan
Vernon’s hand and assume the
letter’s for you--

LADY MANWARING
You think that Lady is my friend
She’s with my husband now as we
speak he visits her

REGINALD
Thats impossible Madam I’ve just
left her she’s entirely alone
even her servant sent off

LADY MANWARING
Owen

The Johnson footman leads Lord Manwaring’s servant OWEN
into the salon

LADY MANWARING (CONT’D)

Owen -- come here stand here
Tell this gentleman what youve
seen

OWEN

Your ladyship

LADY MANWARING
Repeat to him what you told me

Owen turns to Reginald

OWEN
Well Sir Lady Susan sent her

servant away then you left
(MORE)
OWEN (CONTD)
A few minutes later Lord Manwaring
arrived and was received by her
ladyship

REGINALD
Alone

OWEN
Yes sir I believe so No one else
came or went

Lady Manwaring snatches the letter and starts devouring

REGINALD
No - stop The letter’s for Mrs
Johnson only

LADY MANWARING
Here
(reading)
I send Reginald with this letter --
keep him there all evening if you
can Manwaring comes this very
hour”

REGINALD
That’s not possible

LADY MANWARING
I must stop this
(to Mr Johnson)
Please Sir come with me

MR JOHNSON

What could possibly be gained It
could even be dangerous this is a
matter for your solicitors

(turning to Alicia)
Mrs Johnson this goes beyond what
I could imagine -- you promised to
give up all contact with this
woman

ALICIA
Ive no idea what she writes She’s
gone mad

MR JOHNSON
I’m sorry to say my dear that I
hear the Atlantic passage is very
cold this time of year

Alicia is stunned Lucy Manwaring in hysterics
EXTINT CARRIAGE LONDON STRETS -- DAY

Tight on Alicia’s pensive face as she rides in

INT UPPER SEYMOUR STREET -- DAY
Alicia Johnson arrives taking off her cloak

ALICIA
Agonies my dear

SUSAN
What happened

ALICIA
The worst Disaster--

SUSAN
Disaster

ALICIA
Mr DeCourcy arrived just when he
should not have -- Lucy Manwaring
had just forced herself into Mr
Johnson’s study to sob her woes

SUSAN
Has she no pride no self-respect

ALICIA
What an impression she makes --
bursting from Mr Johnsons library
wailing like a struck child Seeing
the letter in your handwriting she
tore it from Reginald to read aloud-

SUSAN
No

ALICIA
Yes Manwaring comes this very
hour

SUSAN

And Reginald heard that

ALICIA
He read it himself

SUSAN
How ungentlemanly Shocking I
can’t believe it

a carriage

ALICIA
Yes very shocking

SUSAN
A gentleman entrusted with
correspondence marked private
reads it regardless -- and then
because of some confidential
remarks the obloquy is mine But
who has acted badly in this affair
Only you and I stand innocent of
reading other people’s
correspondence

ALICIA
Unluckily Lady Manwaring also
wormed out of her husbands servant
that Manwaring visited you in
private

SUSAN
Oh
(she contemplates this)
Facts are horrid things

Susan paces the room then recovers

SUSAN (CONTD)
Dont worry Ill make my story
good with Reginald Hell bea
little enraged at first but I vow
that by dinner tomorrow all will
be well

Alicia looks more doubtful

ALICIA
I’m not sure He was with Mr
Johnson when I left Forgive me for
saying it but I dread to imagine
what’s being said in your
disfavour

Susan stops pacing and regards Alicia with compassion

SUSAN
What a mistake you made marrying
Mr Johnson Too old to be
governable too young to die

Reginald climbs the steps and knocks on the door

INT UPPER SEYMOUR STREET -- DAY

The maid shows Reginald up the stairs -- he is very somber
He enters the salon and addresses Lady Susan

REGINALD
Good afternoon Madam

INT UPPER SEYMOUR STREET OUTSIDE SALON -- DAY

The maid has her ear to the door eavesdropping on the
conversation within We hear through the door

SUSAN
Of course it might seem outlandish
or shocking to others--

INT UPPER SEYMOUR STREET SALON -- DAY
Lady Susan in a dressing gown sits as Reginald stands

SUSAN
-- but we are not expecting others
to read our correspondence and
don’t put things for their benefit
Manwaring only visited me as his
wifes friend--

REGINALD

Friend She herself denies this
SUSAN

Of course -- I was her friend when

she was sane her great enemy

since Manwaring left Langford to
escape her deranged suspicions In
granting him an interview my sole
motive was to persuade him to

return to her and see what might be
done to ease the poor womans mind--
REGINALD
But why “alone” Why did you
arrange to see him alone

SUSAN
You cannot divine the motive there
Servants have ears with the
unfortunate tendency to repeat
whatever they imagine they have
hear I dreaded injuring the poor
lady’s reputation still further

REGINALD
You imagine I could accept such an
explanation

SUSAN
I can only tell you what I know to
be true

REGINALD
Did you succeed

SUSAN
What

REGINALD

Did you convince Manwaring to
return to his wife

SUSAN
Yes I did But it seems that her
judgment is too deteriorated to
allow it Her suspicious and
jealous condition is not one that
will accept reassurance

REGINALD
You forget I saw the letter with
my own eyes--

SUSAN
No I do not forget I greatly
resent it -- a fault you compounded

by misinterpreting what you should
never have seen Do you think I
would have confided a letter to a
third party if I thought its
contents in any way dangerous
Havent I already explained
everything which the ill-nature of
the world might interpret to my
discredit What could so stagger
your esteem for me now

(MORE)
SUSAN (CONTD)
After all weve discussed and meant
to one another that you could
doubt my intentions my actions my
word

Reginald is silent

SUSAN (CONTD)
Im sorry Reginald I’ve reflected
upon this deeply I cannot marry a
man with an untrusting disposition
I cannot have it

REGINALD
(softly stunned)
What

SUSAN
We cannot marry Whatever
commitment there was between us is
severed any connection impossible

REGINALD
What are you saying

SUSAN
Mistrust does not bode well for any
union I have a great regard for
you - yes a passionate one But I
must master it

Distraught Reginald bows and leaves

What is it Mother

LADY DECOURCY
Reginalds returned

CATHERINE
Hes here

LADY DECOURCY
Hes just gone to find your father

CATHERINE
Its not--

LADY DECOURCY
No the most happy news - our fears
were in vain

CATHERINE
What

LADY DECOURCY
The engagements off

CATHERINE
How

LADY DECOURCY
Lady Susan broke it off herself

CATHERINE
She did

Catherine looks apprehensive

LADY DECOURCY
Reginalds most cast down But I’m
sure hell soon recover and -- dare
we hope -- cast his look elsewhere

Catherine thinks further

CATHERINE
That woman’s a fiend

LADY DECOURCY
What do you mean

CATHERINE
Lady Susan She has an uncanny
understanding of mens natures

A look of worry and confusion crosses Lady DeCourcy’s face

LADY DECOURCY
Uncanny

CATHERINE
Reginald will start again to doubt
everything hes heard to her
detriment a guilty regret will
overwhelm him Slowly surely hell
convince himself he’s wronged her

LADY DECOURCY
You frighten me

CATHERINE
Yes if Frederick Vernon renowned
for good sense let Lady Susan ruin
him -- what chance has Reginald

LADY DECOURCY
You speak as if your brother were
not wise everyone comments on his
lively intelligence

CATHERINE
Youre the best of mothers but
Reginald has just the sort of
sincere nature most vulnerable to a
woman of her genius--

LADY DECOURCY
You think she’s a genius

CATHERINE
Diabolically so like the serpent
in Eden’s Garden

LADY DECOURCY
Does this woman always get her way

CATHERINE
From what I understand only clever
tradesmen are astute enough to see
through her stratagems several
banded together to send their
agents to intercept her on Seymour
Street obliging her to pawn the
last of her jewels

Paces can be heard down the hall Reginald and his father
enter Reginald cast down while the old man seems in high
spirits

SIR REGINALD
Slay the fatted calf my dear --
the prodigals returned

He looks to Reginald a wet blanket
SIR REGINALD (CONT’D)
Whats wrong my boy The joy of
seeing your aged parents eludes
you

Lady DeCourcy steps off screen
CATHERINE
Dont tease him Father

SIR REGINALD
It’s a father’s right

CATHERINE
Youll have him fleeing back to
London

REGINALD

No risk of that I assure you
London holds no charm for me

SIR REGINALD
Oh you’ve realized that Good
Never appealed to me at all
Dirty noisy -- noxious gases
soot I dont see the point of
towns Far better to live on one’s
own land Everyone should

CATHERINE
Im afraid this relates to my
sister-in-law

REGINALD
Yes sister -- congratulations on
your entire vindication

CATHERINE
On the contrary I dont see you
out of danger at all

REGINALD
I assuredly am

SIR REGINALD
What’s all this about Whats
happened I don’t understand

Lady DeCourcy re-enters with a sheaf of music and
Frederica

LADY DECOURCY
Reginald dear Fredericas prepared
a charming piece -- help me
persuade her to sing it for us

FREDERICA
Oh no -- youre too kind Lady
DeCourcy I’m not ready--

blushing
REGINALD
Excuse me Miss Vernon Mother As
much as Id like to Im afraid I’m
too tired to be a suitable audience-

Outside the sound of a carriage approaching

REGINALD (CONTD)
So if youll excuse me--

SIR REGINALD
No you must stay Frederica’s a
songbird -- never heard anything
like it
(to Frederica)

Dont deny us this pleasure my
dear Reginald we need you to
insist

REGINALD
Well as I said I--

FREDERICA
No Im sorry Excuse me

LADY DECOURCY
You must play it my dear Please--

SIR REGINALD

her Voices remarkable - even to
my hearing

REGINALD
She must have it from her mother’s
side Lady Susan’s voice is a
clear natural soprano Lovely
beautiful

Catherine looks out the window

SIR REGINALD
Oh it is is it

CATHERINE
Do you expect visitors Mother

LADY DECOURCY
No Who would visit us

Charles Vernon enters smiling
CHARLES
Look whos come from London --
what an agreeable surprise
Lady Susan enters

SUSAN
Excuse me for arriving this way--

Except for Charles the others remain absolutely still

SUSAN (CONTD)
What a delightful family pose

CHARLES
Yes it is the season for families
to unite -- so especially welcome

to have you here

SUSAN
Thank you Charles
(to Sir and Lady DeC)
I do hope that recognizing a
mothers anxiety to see her child
you might excuse my abruptness

CHARLES
Nothing to excuse Sir Reginald
Lady DeCourcy -- might I introduce
my sister-in-law Lady Susan
Vernon

SUSAN
Enchanté Please forgive this
intrusion but now that Im fixed in
town I cant rest with Frederica
away

CATHERINE
Isn’t such anxiety new

SUSAN
(ever cheerful)
Yes it is -- I entirely agree But
now I’m in London where the
instruction Frederica needs can so
readily be found Her voice has
some promise--

SIR REGINALD
“Some” She’s a veritable songbird -
The Kentish Nightingale I call
her

SUSAN
Do you Is this really Kent

She takes a glance in the direction of the window and the
moonlit night

SUSAN (CONTD)
How delightful (Flashes a smile)
You are right Sir -- Frederica has
the native talent a bird might But
those few notes can get repetitive

FREDERICA
But Mama couldn’t I stay
SUSAN

“But Mama couldnt I stay

Charming

Thank you dear sister for making
Frederica feel so welcome and at
home

I’ve secured you a lesson with
Signore Veltroni Where the Grand
Affair of Education is concerned
there’s no excuse for half-
measures

(to Sir Reginald loudly)
Isn’t it key to cultivate her
voice Sir A “nightingale” didn’t
you say

Sir Reginald is a little loud always

SIR REGINALD
Yes that’s right The “Kentish
Nightingale” I call her

SUSAN
A delightful appellation and
perhaps with a teacher such as
Signore Veltroni it could even
become true Frederica have you
your things

LADY DECOURCY
Leave for London now We’d so
looked forward to having Frederica
with us
SUSAN
How remarkable Only a few weeks
ago it was hard to find anywhere
for Frederica now the World fights
for her company Astonishing

CATHERINE
Astonishing that she was neglected
then or is fought over now

SUSAN
An excellent observation dear
sister -- but I will stop now

because I know my daughter hates to
be praised
(to Reginald)
How are you Sir I hope well
(to Frederica)
We should go

FREDERICA
Excuse me Mama I must collect my
things

SUSAN
Yes you must -- we can’t buy a new
wardrobe for each displacement

Frederica and Susan leave

LADY DECOURCY
The poor girl - did you see her
face

CATHERINE
I must talk to her and remind her
that shell always have a home with
us

LADY DECOURCY
(Looking to Sir Reginald)
Or us

CHARLES
If you are referring to the past I
doubt her mother will again risk
misinterpretation Henceforth we
can rest assured that Lady Susan
will make clear to Frederica the
consideration and affection which
guide her actions

I’ve not gone to the trouble of
retrieving Frederica from Parklands
to again be thwarted Maria
Manwaring may sob Frederica
whimper and the Vernons storm -
but Sir James will be Fredericas
husband before the winter’s out

ALICIA
You brilliant creature

SUSAN
Thank you my dear I’m done
submitting my will to the caprices
of others of resigning my own
judgment in deference to those to
whom I owe no duty and feel little
respect Too easily have I let my
resolve weaken Frederica shall
know the difference

ALICIA
You’re too indulgent with the girl -
- why let Frederica have him when
you could grab him yourself

SUSAN
Sir James

ALICIA
Yes I know your unselfish nature --
but can you afford to bestow Sir
James on Frederica while having no
Sir James of your own

A look of disagreeable surprise crosses Susan’s face
Meanwhile a footman approaches

JOHNSON FOOTMAN
(addressing Alicia)
Madam Mr Johnson sends word he
returns to dine

ALICIA
Thank you

SUSAN
(whispers )
Are you insulting me

ALICIA
Just the opposite I dont doubt
your ability to get DeCourcy
whenever you want him but is he
really worth having Isnt his
father just the sort of enraging
old man who will live forever How
would you survive On the allowance
that Frederica as Lady Martin
might grant you As guests at
Churchill Id rather be married to
my own husband than dependent on

INT PARKLANDS -- DAY

Catherine folds a letter she has just finished reading to
Lady DeCourcy the season has changed

CATHERINE
We must protect her -- not just
for her own but for her dear late

father’s

LADY DECOURCY
But what can we do

CATHERINE
We must find the argument that will
persuade her mother it’s in her own
interest which is of course her
only guide That will mean going to
London fortunately Charles must
have some business or other there
to justify such a trip

LADY DECOURCY
What a marvellous husband you have
Charles seems to live to oblige

CATHERINE
It’s true Ive been lucky --
Charles always seems to have some
pretext or other for doing just
whats wanted

Charles arrives from down the hall

CATHERINE (CONTD)
Dearest I believe you have
pressing business in London

Oh um yes

Youre so kind to visit Frederica
will be delighted How are the
children -- especially my dear
Frederick

CATHERINE
Very well thank you--

SUSAN
(calling up the stairs)
Frederica come see who’s here
(to the Vernons)
I cant express my gratitude for
the hospitality you’ve extended us

CHARLES
Not at all -- our great pleasure

Frederica comes down the stairs again in her former fearful
mode

CATHERINE
Hello Frederica

CHARLES
Good afternoon my dear I hope you
are well

FREDERICA
Thank you -- it’s so good to see
you

SUSAN

Frederica why don’t you go
upstairs and play a piece

SUSAN (CONTD)
Select something charming to show
your aunt and uncle what youve
studied

FREDERICA
With pleasure

Frederica leaves

Do mind your head

He ducks going through the door

SUSAN (CONTD)
You’1l see the strides shes been
making - Frederica plays all the
new music Haydn Himmel
BernardiniCherubini

They all sit

CHARLES
So youre happy with the progress
she’s making

SUSAN
(a thoughtful pause quite
long)
Yes Only in a city such as
London I believe could she have
had such instruction

Charles turns to Catherine

CHARLES
Well if Frederica is making such
good progress in London -- that

complicates matters

SUSAN
What complication would that be

CHARLES
Wed hoped Frederica might return
to Churchill

CATHERINE
Shes greatly missed by the little
ones especially--
SUSAN
What a moving sentiment of cousinly
regard My concern my obligation
is to see the defects in
Frederica’s education repaired

CHARLES
Could we invite one of her teachers
to Churchill to continue her
lessons there

SUSAN
What a kind thought But these are
Londons most sought-after masters
no invitation to a country retreat
even such a delightful one as
Churchill is likely to be in their
power to accept

CHARLES
Perhaps a private tutor then--

SUSAN
Might I confess something
Frederica and I have become such
great friends it would be hard for
me to part with her You might have
noticed that for a time there was
a strange tension between us That
has now happily disappeared -- you
can imagine how pleased I am

Catherine seems to sag

SUSAN (CONT’D)
Excuse me are you quite well

CATHERINE
Sorry -- wed so set our hearts on
Frederica’s return

SUSAN

I understand completely Shes
become an agreeable companion --
even her tendency to extreme quiet
I’ve grown to find rather soothing

(a brief glance off)
But there is one factor that
concern me does she look quite
well

CHARLES
Oh yes

SUSAN
That was your impression Londons
vaporous air is not I worry quite
healthy for her Does she not seem
pale

CATHERINE
She does The London air these
smoky gases cannot be salutary for
her Fresh country air is what the
young require

SUSAN
Yes how curious they are

For a moment an awkward silence descends broken by Charles

CHARLES
Does not the town’s dank air favor
the spread of influenza

SUSAN
The influenza In London

CHARLES
Several cases have been reported --
it after all is the season for
it

SUSAN
Of all the disorders in the world
the risk of an influenza contagion
is what I most dread for
Fredericas constitution

CATHERINE
Shouldn’t we consider then removing
her from this danger

SUSAN
What you say gives me pause But
itd be such a hardship to lose my
daughters companionship just as
I’ve come to rely on it -- and of
course her studies

EXT UPPER SEYMOUR STREET -- DAY

From her house Susan climbs into Mrs Johnson’s carriage her
spirit exultant

SUSAN
Congratulate me my dear --
Frederica’s aunt and uncle have
taken her back to Churchill

ALICIA
I thought you’d grown to enjoy
Frederica’s company so

SUSAN
Comparatively A bit But I’m not
so self-indulgent as to want to
wallow in the companionship of a
child

The carriage approaches the park

ALICIA
Alas I fear this is our last
meeting at least while Mr Johnson
is in life His business at
Hartford has become extensive If I
continue to see you he vows to
settle in Con-nect-i-cut forever

SUSAN
(shocked)
You could be scalped

SUSAN (CONTD)

(moved voice tremulous)
I always suspected that the great
word Respectable would one day
divide us Your husband I abhor but
we must yield to necessity Our
affection cannot be impaired by it
and in happier times when your
situation is as independent as
mine we will unite again -- for
this I shall impatiently wait

She gives Alicia’s hands a last squeeze

ALICIA
I also

SUSAN
May Mr Johnsons next gouty attack
end more favorably

The carriage pulls to a stop near the palatial archway
Susan steps down from it and looks through the archway to
where handsome romantic Manwaring waits

EXT CHURCHILL - DAY

A month or more later the season milder A long view of two
figures walking and talking animatedly in the garden --
Frederica and Reginald

INT CHURCHILL MAIN HALL - DAY
A footman hands Charles Vernon correspondence which he looks
through -- one letter attracts his particular attention
Catherine joins him

CHARLES

Do you know where Frederica is
Lady Susan’s written her

INT CHURCHILL GOLD ROOM -- DAY
Catherine looks for Frederica just returned form her walk

CATHERINE
Frederica Frederica

FREDERICA
Coming

CATHERINE
Frederica -- a letter from your
mother

Frederica arrives in walking clothes - followed by Reginald
FREDERICA
Thank you Aunt Catherine What

does she say

CATHERINE
Shes written to you herself

Frederica takes the closed envelope and opens it Charles
joins them

FREDERICA
My mother and Sir James Martin have
wed

REGINALD

What How could that happen How
could they possibly marry

CHARLES
To what do you refer Both were
free to do so he a bachelor Susan

a widow
REGINALD
Sir James Martin is a fool
CATHERINE
Well a bit of a “rattle” perhaps
REGINALD
A bit of a rattle He’s a complete
blockhead
CHARLES

Well there are three possible
explanations as I see it first
perhaps Sir James has more merit
than we’ve allowed--

REGINALD

CHARLES
Second perhaps in order to secure
your future Frederica your mother
thought it necessary to make a
prudent match herself

FREDERICA
That could be the case Mama has
always been concerned for my
future

REGINALD
And the third possible explanation

CHARLES
That she -- came to love him
There is a saying - the heart has
its strangeness or words to that
effect The heart is an instrument
we possess but do not truly know
Human love partakes of the divine
or at least has in my case

Charles looks to Catherine who responds with a sweet smile

CHARLES (CONTD)
I believe you will find it in
Rousseau’s writings -- Julie or
the New Heloise I think

(MORE)
CHARLES (CONTD)
I will confirm the citation if
youre interested

REGINALD
I just find it incomprehensible
that so brilliant a woman could
Marry such a pea brain or peas
brain

CHARLES
This happens all the time

Catherine smiles at him

REGINALD
It strains credulity

CHARLES

Certainly -- as you’ve said--

(nod to Catherine)
Sir James is no “Solomon” but if
he can give Lady Susan the
happiness and security which the
sad events of recent years deprived
her then hes someone I and all of
us should value

FREDERICA
I very much agree Uncle we all
should -- I wish them every

happiness in their life together

INT EDWARD ST MAIN PARLOR - DAY

Sir James Martin in very good spirits follows Alicia
Johnson into the room

ALICIA
I congratulate you Sir James on a
match I long favored there’s a
rightness to your being together --
not that any man could really
deserve Lady Susan

SIR JAMES
I agree most heartily And I’ve
the pleasure of adding that double
congratulations are in order

ALICIA
What

SIR JAMES
The most beautiful woman in England
- present company excepted - will
soon be the most beautiful mother
Yes I’m to be a father

ALICIA
Marvelous You certainly don’t
delay matters Congratulations

Sir

The footman brings in the elaborate tea service Alicia mixes
the tea

SIR JAMES
Yes The very morning after the
wedding Lady Susan hinted at the
happy news - which was shortly
confirmed

ALICIA
How truly marvelous

SIR JAMES
Im as proud as you can imagine

The sound of a wheezing sob off screen

SIR JAMES (CONTD)
Whats that

ALICIA
(whispers )
Such a burden When Lord and Lady
Manwaring separated Mr Johnson --
who was Lucy Manwaring’s guardian --
invited her to live with us

SIR JAMES
Really What upsets her
ALICIA
The separation still She keeps on
about it
SIR JAMES
What
ALICIA

All this carrying on about a
marriage that ended weeks ago If a
woman fails to please her husband --
why go on about it advertising
one’s failure

(MORE)

ALICIA (CONTD)
Why announce to the world that the
man who knows you best would rather
be with someone else

SIR JAMES

It seems as if Lady Manwaring has
failed to consider the difference
between the sexes For a husband
to wander is not the same as vice
versa If a husband strays he’s
merely responds to his biology -
that is how men are made

(smiling complacently)
But for a woman to act in a similar
way is ridiculous unimaginable
Just the idea is funny

(laughs )
Hew hew hew hew hew

ALICIA
Oh yes -- couldn’t agree more
quite funny ha ha ha

They sit From the silver samovar Alicia pours the water
over the tea

SIR JAMES
I rather blame Lady Manwaring’s
scene-making for driving her
husband away But her loss has been
our gain As a result of all the
trouble her solicitors caused
weve had him with us these past
weeks

ALICIA
That’s not inconvenient

SIR JAMES

Not at all Capital fellow
Couldn’t get on better -- loves to
hunt small and large game
Excellent to have a guest and the
talk which comes with it Of course
Lady Susans sharp but its easier
to talk with a fellow particularly
one who shares one’s interests
Before long well have another
guest

ALICIA
Frederica

SIR JAMES
(laughs )
No Of course the baby

The door bursts open - Lady Manwaring distraught and
disheveled enters

LADY MANWARING
Manwaring Manwaring Have you seen
my husband What have you been
saying Sir Tell me How is he

SIR JAMES
Well Madam very well I believe
Couldnt be better

Lady Manwaring leaves sobbing

ALICIA
Tea

SIR JAMES
Quite

EXT CHAPEL AT CHURCHILL -- DAY

As guests enter the chapel Sir James Martins carriage pulls
up Sir James Martin a very pregnant Lady Susan and
Manwaring alight from it Sir James stepping slightly ahead

SIR JAMES
(pleased then confused)
So here’s the Church But where’s
the hill Don’t see it
(looking around)
Doesn’t seem to be one -- strange
Odd

Sir James steps toward the portal as other guests enter the
church Manwaring looks handsome -- and content

INT CHAPEL AT CHURCHILL -- DAY

Immediately after the wedding guests crowd around the portal
holding the green garland arch The crowd cheers and throws
wheat as the newlyweds -- Frederica and Reginald -- pass
beneath LITTLE CHARLOTTE VERNON advancing with her parents
Catherine and Charles Vernon calls out to the couple

LITTLE CHARLOTTE VERNON
God bless you all

INT CHURCHILL MAIN HALL -- DAY

The joyous arrival of wedding guests to the hall of Churchill
for cake and further celebration within which there are
small groupings

--A footman places a beautiful light blue wedding cake on the
table

--Frederica with Charles Vernon and Sir Reginald and Lady
DeCourcy

CHARLES
Your mother must be very proud

FREDERICA
And I am enormously grateful to
her Without my mother’s efforts I
would never have found such
happiness Do excuse me

--The Young Curate speaks with Catherine Vernon

CURATE
Oh no That would be the Ninth

--Lady Susan Manwaring and Sir James Martin in another
grouping

SIR JAMES
You must be most proud of
Frederica

SUSAN
I would not say “proud” -- I am
glad that I was able to attend to
her Education My daughter has
shown herself to be cunning and

manipulative -- I couldn’t be more
pleased A Vernon will never go
hungry

Sir James raises a cheerful toast while Susan and Manwaring
exchange a passionate glance

--Sir Reginald and Lady DeCourcy with Charles Vernon

LADY DECOURCY
We must ask Frederica to sing

CHARLES
That would be delightful
(confiding)
The “Surrey Songbird” we call her

Sir Reginald seems irritated

SIR REGINALD
What No she’s the Kentish
Nightingale -- always call her
that “Surrey Songbird” --
nonsense rubbish ridiculous

Wilson the butler announces

WILSON
Ladies and gentlemen Mr Reginald
DeCourcy

--The crowd turns to Reginald standing with a beaming and
lovely Frederica

REGINALD

Over the past months I have
continued to be startled by
Frederica’s loveliness and good-
heart I had wanted to write some
verses as a memorial to these
discoveries -- but they are now so
extensive they would form a volume
so I will just read these few
lines

(reading from his notes)
Blest tho she is with evry human
grace
The mien mean” engaging and
bewitching face

Sir Reginald looks confused

SIR REGINALD
“Mien engaging”

CHARLES
Yes “mien” -- appearance or
countenance -- from the French

“mine” I believe I could find you
the reference

On the raised steps Reginald completes reciting the verse to
Frederica

REGINALD
Yet still an higher beauty is her
care
Virtue the charm that most adorns
the fair

The crowd cheers -- various reaction shots from the other
side of the room Sir James Martin particularly pleased
raises his glass in a toast Lady Susan and Manwaring
exchange a devoted look

--On the raised steps now Frederica alone and a happy
Reginald below continues

FREDERICA
As you may already know I take Lady
DeCourcy’s requests as commands and
therefore I will sing this piece

The crowd gathers to hear

FREDERICA (CONTD)
(sings )
Over the mountains
And over the waves
Under the fountains
And under the graves
Under floods that are deepest
Which Neptune obey
Over rocks that are the steepest
Love will find out the way

As Frederica sings her voice beautiful the reaction shots
from all concerned the very pregnant Lady Susan and others
ending with Sir Reginald and Lady DeCourcy’s affectionate
embrace

FREDERICA (CONTD)
You may esteem him
A child for his might
Or you may deem him
A coward from his flight
But if she whom Love doth honor
Be concealed from the day
Set a thousand guards upon her
Love will find out the way

As the music swells credits roll
