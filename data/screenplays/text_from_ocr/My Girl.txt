devastated when he learned of my latest
affliction

breast is developing at a significantly faster
rate than my right It can only mean one
thing Cancer Im dying

SUMMER WRITING CLASS FOCUS ON MR BIXLER

MR BIXLER
The great way is not difficult for those
with no preferences with the absence of both
love and hate everything becomes clear and
undisguised That was written by a Chinese
Philosopher in the year 600 Now why would I
choose to bring that up in a creative writing
class Because the absence of judgment helps
us to appreciate reality In other words I
want you to listen to your classmates writing
with a clear and open heart okay So whos
gonna go first

GUY
I got one

He gets up

I sang a song for you to hear I painted a
picture for you to see I picked a rose for
you to smell I planted grass for you to
touch But you did not hear my song You did
not see my picture You did not smell my rose
and YOU did not touch my grass

Woman
Maybe she was outta town
GUY2
Thats not funny his poem is about futility
we toil in unrewarded obscurity

MR BIXLER
Now I hear judgment lets not forget the
part about the open heart

The door at the back of the room opens and Vada enters
holding a writing pad and pen looking nervous

horse and all they do is ride and eat
marshmallows all day and everybodys best
friends with everybody else when you play
sports theres no teams so nobody gets
picked last

THOMAS J
But what if youre afraid to ride horses

VADA
It doesnt matter cause theyre not regular

if you fall you just land in cloud

THOMAS J

never find that streamer

As they leave Vada turns back and grabs the photo then
returns to Thomas J

VADA
Bed wetter

THOMAS J

I stopped that

AT THE CHURCH FOCUS ON THE BINGO ANNOUNCER WHO IS CALLING
OUT THE NUMBERS

HARRY
Dont worry theres a strategy to bingo For
instance on a given night anybody can win
but I play the odds when choosing bingo
cards I use a range of theories from the laws
of probability to avoiding duplicate number
systems This way you get much more activity

SHELLY
(hopeful)
Does it make it easier to win

HARRY
No Just more activity

Harry then pulls a seat out and sits down in it cutting
Shelly off who has to pull her own seat out and sit down

HARRY
(as he sits down to the
person next to him)
Hi Carl

OUTSIDE THE CHURCH NIGHT
Vada and Thomas J are walking up to the church

THOMAS J
Theyre not gonna let us in Vada were kids

VADA
Were not gonna bet were just gonna watch

THOMAS J
Watch bingo I dont even like to play bingo

VADA
Duck

Vada and Thomas J are ducking behind a counter on one side
of the church Harry and Shelly are quite clearly visible on
the other side of the room

SHELLY
(in the distance as a number
is announced)
Oh great

THOMAS J
Hey theres your Dad and Shelly

VADA
Ssshhhhh I dont want them to see me

SHELLY
(in the distance again as
another number is announced)
Aarrggh
CLOSE UP OF HARRY AND SHELLY

As Shelly looks around the bingo table she notices that
everyone around her is chronologically advantaged in a big
way

SHELLY

THOMAS J

after dark

CLOSE UP AGAIN

SHELLY
Oh Im just not lucky Harry

HARRY
Look its not always luck I mean depending
upon the placement of the numbers a guy with
10 cards could win just as easily as a guy
with 100

SHELLY
Kinda like men

HARRY
Oh how do you mean

SHELLY
You can be in a room with 100 men and not
like any of them or you can be in a room with
just one man and hes exactly the one you
want

Harry and Shelly are about to kiss each other Vada sees
this and doesnt look too happy about it

VADA
(in semi-deep fake voice)

VADAS BEDROOM NIGHT VADA IS LYING ON HER BED THINKING
As she hears Harrys car approaching she goes to her
window and looks out it through the venetian blinds

advice and let Shelly get out herself which she does

about how to maximize small spaces

HARRY
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems

SHELLY
You can look in the bathroom if you want

Harry moved toward the back of the camper and looks in the
bathroom and then flushes the toilet

HARRY

SHELLY

MR BIXLER
Before the class started Ronda and Justin
wanted to lead the class in a group
meditation

WOMAN
Ooooh thats really cool

JUSTIN
Okay what were gonna do is send our vibes

out into the group

Justin turns on some kind of tape deck which begins to play
weird music

RONDA
Everybody hold hands and close your eyes
Relax your muscles and take deep breaths

JUSTIN
Now try to feel what the other person is
feeling without speaking any words send out
your vibe and receive the vibes around you at
the same time Can you feel it

RONDA
Okay open your eyes What did everybody
feel

GUY

I felt Mrs Hunsakers strength

OTHER GUY
I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth
shes so cosmically in tune

RONDA
So right on thats exactly what I sent out
and I felt like you were full of inner peace
and harmony

MR BIXLER
Vada what did you feel

VADA
I felt Justins hangnail

JUSTIN
No Vada thats not what were looking for a
hangnail is insignificant Whats in my soul
feel my aura

VADA
I dont think Im allowed to

JUSTIN
I tell you what lets try it again hold
hands

VADAS THOUGHTS
Grammoo once had a hangnail on her big toe
It got infected and traveled to her vocal
chords it ruined her singing voice I dont
think Grammoo thought it was insignificant
VADAS ROOM VADA LYING ON BED THINKING

Vada gets out of bed and goes down corridor to see Grammoo
she seats herself cross legged next to Grammoo on her bed
and takes her hands in an attempt to do some spiritual
healing

SUPERMARKET DAY VADA AND HARRY ARE SHOPPING
HARRY

Lettuce watch out for the rust when you get
lettuce

Suddenly Shelly appears behind them and calls out

barbecue

SHELLY

HARRY

Vada who is pushing the shopping trolley behind Harry and
Shelly obviously does not like the idea of Harry and Shelly
and she rams her cart into Harry

HARRY

(picking up large can of
prunes)
Dad didnt you say you needed prunes REAL
bad
HARRY

Ahh Vada just put anything you want in the
cart anything at all

(to Shelly)
I dont know whats gotten into her today

Vada begins to throw cans of every description from the
shelf into the shopping trolley at regular intervals not
giving a stuff what they contain

VADAS THOUGHTS
I used to like to play with my Ken and Barbie
dolls Ken was my favorite Then one Christmas
I got them a camper and all they wanted to do
was hang out in it by themselves So I wasnt
too upset when they took that wrong turn and
went over a cliff

together she decides to make her move and pushes in between
Harry and Shelly

VADA

Shelly begins to brush Vadas hair with her fingers which
Vada does not like and she shakes her head to get Shelly off

VADA

Shelly again tries to fix up Vadas hair
(which there doesnt appear
to be anything wrong with)

And Vada shakes her off again

the thumbs up Vada looks VERY intent on brutally murdering
something now and she returns the thumbs up as she does
so music begins to play and the power is turned on the
song is Bad Moon Rising

HARRY

Vada rushes straight at Shelly and rams into her at top
speed so that Shellys car is spun around a little Shelly

escape Vada

The family has asked me to say a few words

one word that keeps ringing in my ear is
Why Why would God choose to take this
little boy from us I cant give you an answer
to that question but I can tell you that God
has chosen Thomas J for some very special
reason we must find solace in knowing that
Thomas J is now in Gods care In that face

Vada and Mr Bixler hug each other

VADA
I cant stay I just came to read my poem

MR BIXLER
Wed love to hear it

VADA
Weeping willow with your tears running down
Why do you always weep and frown Is it
because he left you one day Is it because he
could not stay On your branches he would
swing Do you long for the happiness that they
would bring He found shelter in your shade
He thought his laughter would never fade
Weeping willow stop your tears There is
something to calm your fears You think death
as if you forever part But I know hell
always be in your heart

There is a long pause as it sinks in everybody remains
silent then just before the scene changes the Temptations
song My Girl begins to play

OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL VADA COMES OUT THE DOOR AND DOWN THE
STEPS WHERE JUDY AWAITS HER
