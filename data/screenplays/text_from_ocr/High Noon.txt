SOME NOTES ABOUT THIS STORY

THE TIME is about 1870 or 1875

THE PLACE 1s HADLEYVILLE population around 400 located
in a Western territory still to be determined a town just old
enough to have become pleasantly aware of its existence and to
begin thinking of ts appearence

There is one street a rambling crooked affair that
begins at the railroad station meanders along through the town
ends a little way past the relatively new Commercial Hotel and
then becomes a narrow and disappearing path into the prairie Most
of the people in town particularly those in better circumstances
have built houses away from the street and some of them even have
small lawns and flower patches most of them rather pathetic

Between the station and the hotel are to be found the
majority of the settings for the action of the story the Marshals
office and the courtroom the Ramirez Bar the barber shop the
general store the livery stable Other establishments that should
be indicated but vill not be used (as of this writing) will be in
tune with the place and period e bank restaurants rooming houses
a millinery shop a hand laundry etc Almost all the build ings
along the street have some kind of structures behind them such as
outhouses or sheds or in some cases living quarters

Not so long ago Hadleyville like many other frontier
towns that were at the mercy of nearby feudal barons had been
terrorized by Gil Jordan and bis retainers From his ranch Gil
Jordan had ruled Hadleyville and ruled it ruthlessly and cruelly
There are still men -- and women too who beer the physical marks
of Jordans maniacal rages Five years ago however Marshal Will
Doane backed by a half a dozen hard-riding deputies had broken
the Jordan gang and arrested Jordan for murder At his trial he
had been sentenced to hang but Jordans influential friends in the
territorial capital hed had his sentence commuted to life imprison-
ment Now five years later Hadleyville is a safe place for women
and children Law end order have been so firmly established that
Doane now has only two deputies

THE PEOPLE are MARSHAL WILL DOANE HELEN RAMIREZ
AMY DOANE HARVEY PELL and others

WILL DOANE is in his middle thirties Adequately
educated he is a second-generation vwesterner in a land that is
still spreading out Like most of the other citizens of Hadleyville
he is not a native of the town He is direct practical not too

articulate His appreach to the job of peace officer is mattear-or-
fact umromantic but im the five years that he has been town
marshal he has alvays Liked it He has enjoyed the prestige it has
given bim and the knowledge that he s respected and Liked by the
townspeople Now that he is being married he is leaving the job
and the town with some regret but secure in the feeling that he is
doing the sensible thing in moving to another town where a general
store should do good business

He is certainly not an average man tut a very human
one Some two years ago he had a somewhat lengthy affair with

HELEN RAMIREZ She is two or three years older than
Deane « victim of an era and environment vith rigid social stand-
ards To begin with Helen is half Mexican and thus neither
acceptable to the “pure” American vomen of the region nor eligible
for « good marriage Consequently in addition to being intelli-
gent atirewi and strong-willed she is also hard and resentful
Physically she is handsome full-breasted passionate More she
has style personality

Some years ago Helen had carried Ramirez the local
salcon-keeper After his death she hed become Gil Jordans mistress
With Jordan in jail for Lite Helen hed herself selected Will Doane
as his successor and Helen still cannot forgive Doane for ending
the liason for this 1s a priviledge she reserves for herselr
Recently she has allowed herself to drift into an affair with
Harvey Pell Doanes friemi end deputy A good business women she
has long since disposed cf her interest in the Ramirez saloon ani
ds a silent pertner in the towns general store

AMY DOANE 1s without knowing it one of the new vomen
of the period women who are beginning to rebel against the limit
ations and restrictions of the Victorian epech Young attractive
intelligent strongewilled Amy 1s determined not to be a sheltered
toy-wife but a full partner in her marciage ami 1t is she who has
planned their future More Amy has strong emotional end intellectual
convictions against any form of violence because her father and
brothers were killed while taking pert in Vigilante action end
she has ince embraced the Quaker faith Marriage to Deane would
have been unthinkable had he remained a peace officer

RARVEY FELL is younger than Deane his deputy and friend
But beneath that friendship is a nagging sense of inferiority and an
envy of Deane ‘Thus although he has secretly taken Doanes place
as Helens lover he has a feeling that he has not really replaced
Deane In addition Harvey is ambitious amcious to prove his manhood
end importance He bas hoped to be appointed Mershal in Deanes
place and he has expected that Doane would secure the position for
him Since the promotion has not taken place he is resentful towards
Doane for this as well Yet with all this there is a remnant of
the old liking Doane however is unaware of the change in Harveys
feelings toward hin
42 High Noon

OTHERS ARE PERCY METTRICK Justice of the Peace
JONAS HENDERSON WILLIAM FULLER and MARTIN HOWE selectmen MILT
JORDAN PIERCE and COLSY remmants of the Jordan gang SAM Helens
elderly retainer TOBY Doanes other deputy and a surorising
mumber of other bits

METTRICK is urbane cultured cynical unmarried
niddle-aged

HENDERSON AND FULLER and their WIVES are in the same
age category and very solid citizens

MART HOWE is about sixty a bachelor He has been a
peace officer all his life but age and the arthritis that has
crippled his hands have caused his retirement some years before

MILT JORDAN Gils younger brother JAMES PIERCE and

JACK COLBY ere all that remain of the Jordan bunch Milt is handsome

wild with cruel eyes and a quick meaningless smile Colby is
dour remote indrawn Pierce the oldest and the leader is a
chronically sour-tempered man nervous and irritable

SAM 13 a thin leathery taciturn man about Martin Howes

age He looks as if he has known a considerable amount of violence

and hard-Living (and probably lawlessness) in his time from which

like Mart Howe -- he has retired but in his own way Helen Ramirez

is the only person in town amd perhaps the vorld for whom he has

any feeling You sense that he s intensely loyal and devoted that
he understands and admires her and that he 4s content to be her
watchdog

DR MARIN the minister is a sincere devout unvorldly
man who has his share of human weakness

TOBY Deanes other Deputy ts about Harvey Pells age
Lacking Harveys tense drive he is good-natured easy-going
dependable in a fight

Other characters will be described as we go along How-
ever while we are here we may es vell describe the settings for
some of the scenes to follow

These are the Commercial Hotel Helen Ramirez’
roous the courtroom the Marshals office the Ramirez
Bar the Berbershop the livery stable the Church the railroad station Martin Howes home (LL) Wilidam
Pullers home the general store and Mendosas place

The COMMERCTAL HOTEL would seem to be about six years
old It is a two-story building The desk 9 in the center hall
om one side of which is the small lobby and on the other cut off
from view by curtains or swinging doors the dining reom From the
hall a stairway leads up to the secomd floor vhere all rooms are
entered from the hall

HELEN RAMIREZ cecupies two connecting rooms on the
secomd floor of the hotel toward the front One is her bedroom
and the other has been furnished as a Kind of sitting room or what

was called a front room then The front room overlooks che street
Ber taste is fairly expensive feminine and good
FE WILL DOANES OFFICE vhich he shares with Judge
Bq Mettrick ig one-story building on the main street On one
Side of the office is the COURTROOM and on the other the jail ‘The
‘ courtroom is still a somewhat makeshift affair but the bench
witness stam jury box attorney tables and spectators’ section
can be recognized We will probably not see the jail The Doane-
Mettrick office should be large enough to contain two desks chairs
etc The Gun-Fighter” had a very gocd marshals office
) am The RAMIREZ BAR is a typical small saloon of the period
‘ bar and some tables but no dance floor no stage no glittering
fee gambling layouts
thes TRE CHURCH has a capacity of about 200 a small wooden
structure It has a small organ or whatever they vere called then
reed and behimd the pulpit there hengs a large painted replica of the
Ten Comandmenta

THE BARBER SHOP hes one chair and e round card table
The window bears the following lewemi BARBER SHOP AND DENTIST

UNDERTAKING H LeSIBUR PROP Behind the shop are Living quarters
axd space designed for Mr LeSieurs other activities but ve will

‘ p nome of these except the shed where coffins are built amd stored

MART HOWES HOME is small simple almost barren
reflecting his bachelorhood WILLTAM FULLERS HOME is larger more
affluently furnished in the taste of the period and fussy showing
the hand and taste of his wite Although we will use both exteriors
we will probably see culy the living-room of each house

THE LIVERY STALE fronts on the main street but the
stable part where the horses are stalled is at the rear and out
of sight and hearing froma the street

THE RAILROAD STATION for our purposes 1s one small
Dudlding Part of this is waiting reom and part has been parti-
tioned off to be the Station-Master’s Office The office windows
look cut to the track and to ea large bench outside It 1s presently
planned to play the material with Milt Jordan Pierce ami Colby
outside the station house

THE GENERAL STORE ia a typical store of the period If
possible it should be imiicated that the store is a prosperous one
Tt shouldnt be too large though

MENDOZAS PLACE is a stopping-off place some five or
ten miles from town comtaining mle accomodations for horses and
humans For cur purposes we will probably see only the corral
the exterior of the building ami the interior of the combined bar
and eating space -- in other words one large recom comtatning a bar
tables a large fireplace etc It is not a fancy place For a
goed picturization of this kind of establishment you should see

They are too far from the church to be recognized by any
of the people going in and when they pags the CAMERA as
they ride away from it they seem oblivious to it Although
they are only cantering they ride with porpose and it is
as if the church and the People do not even impinge then-

while he executed the members
of the legal government A
aimilar thing took place about
elght yeers ago in a town called
Indian Falls I escaped death
only through the intercession of
a lady of somewhat dubious reputa-
tion and at the cost of « handsome
ring that once belonged to oy
mother

Unfortunately I have no more rings

it in one of the saddlebags He turns to the picture
of Justice and takes it down
