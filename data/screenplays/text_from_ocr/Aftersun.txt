AFTERSUN

INT A RAVE 1

SOPHIE 31 stands motionless in a frenetic crowd Eyes
closed she is out of place and time a warm crew neck jumper
in contrast to the 90s rave attire and naked torsos that
surround her A strobe casts her in light then darkness
light then darkness

Cued by the strobe in her place now stands a girl SOPHIE
11 dressed identically As partygoers push past fragmentary
glimpses of 11-year-old Sophie and 31-year-old Sophie Adult
Sophie alternate with the light both fixed in position
eyes shut

As the beat escalates on the verge of falling into a groove
Adult Sophie opens her eyes

CUT TO BLACK
Over black the sound of a tape being inserted into a camera
the closing of a cassette door the pressing of a switch the
whirring of internal mechanisms
A momentary burst of audio static as a cable is plugged into
a speaker
INT AIRPORT - DAY 2
DVCAM FOOTAGE

An airport corridor A grainy image of a snaking queue ahead
of the security checkpoint

The accentuated sound of breaths off screen within the
recording

One last breath The footage cuts to video black

The tape rewinds slow at first then picking up pace As the
images blur past mostly too abstract to make out we catch
faces a hotel room sea and sky

Eventually a click The tape begins to play from its
beginning

INT PLANE - DAY 3

DVCAM FOOTAGE CONT’D

A still blank low-quality image with a bluish tint holds
over a loud low-frequency drone

The sound of fumbling of buttons from the recording crudely
amplified by an in-built microphone

A moving image now but completely abstract a pale shade of
yellow fills the screen It morphs into white back to blue
and so on Some shifts are gradual the soundtrack
continuous others sudden and accompanied by a skip in the
tone of the continuous rumble

Now a still image

- The wide open mouth of a child a huge gap between her
front two teeth uvula dangling in full view

Black More rustle from the recording clicking of buttons
A series of further still images

- The lower half of the same girl’s face in profile her
tongue sticking out

- Back to frontal her tongue fixed above her bottom lip
She laughs

SOPHIE (0S)
Does that not look like my top lip

- Ears pulled out cheeks puffed SOPHIE 11 a tomboy sits
next to the window of a plane mid-flight

She laughs again delighted

- CALUM 30 boyish until closely scrutinised holds up a
travel guidebook DK’S GUIDE TO TURKEY It covers his mouth
only his eyes peak out above it

- A close-up of the book

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
“Bazaars beaches mosques
history ruins

(beat)

And
(with exaggerated
enthusiasm)
Carpets Dad carpets

- A close up on Calum dark around the eyes serious aware
that the camera is on him

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
Is it actually possible for you to
smile

(MORE)
SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
(beat)
Properly

- A blurred image of Calum in motion attempting to avoid the
camera a goofy wide grin spread across his face

Playback pauses the in-camera sound stops replaced by the
distant hum of street traffic on the other side of a closed
window

We push in on the image on Calum’s goofy uncomfortable
grin A flicker of distortion

Then as if playing on an old record player in another room
we hear

PA SYSTEM
Ladies and gentlemen we will
shortly begin our descent In
preparation for landing please
make sure your seat backs and tray
tables are in their full upright
position

EXT AIRPORT LANDING STRIP - EARLY DUSK 4

PA SYSTEM CONT’D
Make sure your seat belt is
securely fastened and all carry-on
luggage is underneath the seat in
front of you or in the overhead
bins Please turn off all
electronic devices at this time

The sound of the PA announcement fades and the image of
Calum’s face gradually gives way to the purple blue of dusk

The crescendo of a descending aircraft
A plane passes in a flash overhead

MAIN TITLE AFTERSUN

INT TRANSFER BUS - LATE DUSK 5
TURKEY late ‘90s

A battery falls to the floor and rolls beneath seats past a
crisp packet between feet until a hand reaches down to pick
it up Row by row it’s passed back up the packed bus past
families rowdy groups of friends in their late teens and
20s and couples young and old

The battery reaches a man - late 20s his girlfriend asleep
on his shoulder He hands it to Calum on the aisle whose arm
is covered in a plaster cast from elbow to knuckles

CALUM
(taking it)
Cheers

BELINDA (0S)
Hiya everyone My name’s Belinda -
Ill be your tour rep for the next
week or two

Calum hands Sophie the battery

SOPHIE
They’re dead anyway

CALUM
Put it back in for now We’1l get
more tomorrow

BELINDA (0S)
I’ve only just transferred in from
Torre —

The sound system cuts out Sophie and Calum glance up

BELINDA - tanned early 20s - stands at the front of the bus
She taps the faulty microphone in her hand

BELINDA (CONTD)
(shouting)
From Torremolinos

“Torremolinos” peaks the tinny speakers which kick back in
mid-word Belinda laughs a distinct high-pitched laugh

BELINDA (CONTD)
Right well I hope I’1l be a good
help to you here in Turkey all the
same We’ve got seven stops
tonight so bear with us alright

Calum packs Sophie’s Walkman away He leans in
CALUM
Hiya - my name’s Belinda and I’ve

just come in from “Torremolinos”

Calum imitates Belinda’s speed-of-light pronunciation of
“Torremolinos” Sophie giggles
SOPHIE
Torreliminos

The overhead lights go dark

Calum takes out his own Walkman He holds out a headphone for
Sophie She takes it

Out of the airport complex now the coach passes through the
unfamiliar darkness mottled with lights from local homes set
into the hills

As the mostly indiscernible view rushes by the din of fellow
holiday-goers fades to sleepy quiet

INT TRANSFER BUS - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER 6

The bus turns into a brighter enclave

Sophie is nestled snugly against Calum’s shoulder eyes shut
His broken arm rests on top of her with effortless intimacy

BELINDA (0S)
Sunshine Villa Families Taylor
Walker and Addison

These respective families rise from their seats

YOUNG BOY
Mummy is there a McDonald’s here

FATHER
On you go mate

The boy’s father gently ushers him on

Calum takes the headphone that has fallen to Sophie’s
shoulder Not entirely asleep she reaches for it allowing
her hands to be intentionally clumsy smushing his face until
she has the headphone back in hand

Outside the window the driver hauls luggage out of the hold

EXT STREET - NIGHT - LATER 7

The driver deposits the last two suitcases onto the dusty
street

CALUM (0S)
Patterson It’s Calum and Sophie
Patterson
BELINDA (0S)
Last but not least eh

Sophie yawns tired She watches as a family of four and a
young couple cross to the Ocean Park Resort a sizeable hotel
complex with an entryway propped up by Greek columns

BELINDA (CONTD)
And is this your little sister
then

CALUM
My daughter actually

BELINDA
Away with you she’s not

Belinda laughs her unmistakable laugh

Calum turns to meet Sophie’s gaze A private joke — they’ve
heard this before

BELINDA (CONTD)
Right well that’s you across the
way

She gestures to a modest hotel on the other side of the
street - The Tiirk Hotel - nice enough were its facade not
masked by scaffolding

EXT STREET - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 8
The transfer bus pulls back up the street

BELINDA (POST-LAP)
Well see you tomorrow at the Ocean
Park 4 o’clock sharp Don’t miss
us won’t you

Calum and Sophie pick up their belongings
SOPHIE CALUM
My name’s Belinda and I’m Torremolinos

from Torremolinos

They laugh together as they approach their hotel eventually
disappearing from sight through its entrance

INT TURK HOTEL RECEPTION - NIGHT 9
Calum rings a bell on the unmanned reception desk Sophie is
slumped on a wicker-backed chair They’ve been waiting for a
few minutes already

A large dog enters from within the hotel - Sophie offers a
tentative hand The dog licks it

CALUM
Hang tight poppet

Sophie wipes her hand clean on the seat cover

Calum steps through a door No sooner than it closes behind
him he reenters

SOPHIE
I’m fine

Calum considers this for a moment then leaves a second time
The dog flops to Sophie’s feet as she inspects the books and
magazines scattered on the table Elle Magazine the German
edition of HELLO a local newspaper and a stack of erotic
paperback novels with worn broken spines Sophie leans down
and without lifting it off the table she begins to leaf
through one

The door reopens and immediately her gaze flits back up

Calum reenters

CALUM
Someone’s coming

Sophie yawns again

CALUM (CONTD)
Time for bed

Sophie shakes off her yawn

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 10

Sophie lies sprawled on the only bed asleep and fully
clothed

Calum perched on the side of the bed picks up the phone

CALUM
Hello

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER 11

At the foot of the bed now Calum leans down and from an
awkward angle fumbles the knots of Sophie’s laces his
fingers constricted by the plaster cast over his hand and
lower arm

CALUM (POST-LAP)

(beat)

Right yeah That’s us
(beat)

I had booked a room with two beds
but we’ve only got the one here

He slips off her trainers then her socks

CALUM (POST-LAP) (CONTD)

Well I paid for it It was
confirmed by the travel agency

(beat)
That’s all you can do

(beat)
It’1ll have to be then

(beat)
Okay Thanks

(beat)
Good night

He sighs

He tugs at the sheet to cover her with She groans doesn’t
want it He persuades her half-under then kisses her
forehead

Calum takes the Walkman from his rucksack and fishes for
something else but comes up short He rifles through a
jacket pocket then seemingly content rises to stand
Sophie manoeuvres herself properly under the covers Calum
freezes clenching the fist which holds whatever he has just
retrieved

After a moment certain that Sophie is sleeping he stands
and turns off the light

The sound of a sliding door pulled open

EXT HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - NIGHT 12

On a shallow balcony a few floors up two white plastic
chairs are set around a small table

Like the street-facing exterior the facade of the building
running along the length of the pool below is partly covered
by scaffolding

Leaning against the railing Calum struggles to light his
crumpled cigarette with a flimsy hotel matchbook Failing to
strike a match with his broken hand he swaps Eventually
the flame takes the cigarette held between his lips catches
light and he returns the matchbook to his pocket

Calum dials up the volume on his Walkman set down on the
table The sound spilling through the headphones is just
sufficient to be heard by him alone

He takes a long slow drag from the cigarette and moves with
the music his arms loose and free For a moment it’s as
though he’s somewhere else

EXT HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - NIGHT - A LITTLE LATER 13

Calum sits perched on the balcony railing in silence his
legs dangling precariously over a three-story fall

He watches as a HOTEL EMPLOYEE closes up sun beds and tidies
away empty bottles by the pool Each bottle clinks noisily as
it is tossed into a bag

From inside through a gap in the curtains we watch Calum
as if from a specific point of view as he takes the last
smoke of his cigarette and continues to sit unsupported on
the railing

EXT TURK HOTEL - EARLY MORNING 14

From the scaffold the sound of metal on metal — clang
clang clang then drilling

The same hotel employee from the night before opens up the
sun beds stationed around the pool

The hotel dog meanders nearby

INT HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 15

A hotel information booklet lies on the dresser pictures of
the property in better days

The building work continues outside

Sophie still clothed and Calum in boxer shorts lie in
identical positions on the bed — face down arms above their
heads

EXT TURK HOTEL POOLSIDE - DAY 16
DVCAM

More drilling Three men at work on the scaffolding The
camera zooms in and out again

Fragments of tile fall from the roof

The camera pans down to a beach towel under the shade of an
umbrella then to the pool entirely overexposed After a
second the exposure is auto-corrected

In the pool Sophie plays on a lilo determined to stand on
it as if it were a surfboard She topples into the water

CALUM (0S)
See if you let it rest on an
object for a wee while it gets the
lighting right That’s quite
clever

(beat)
Give us a wave poppet

SOPHIE
Wait wait wait

Sophie scrambles out of the pool stands on the edge and
jumps belly first onto the lilo which immediately rolls She
pulls herself back on top and offers a toothy grin as she
catches her breath

The image zooms into her face scrunched up in the sun

CALUM (0OS)
Come on then Top up time

Sophie takes a deep breath and with both hands gripping
either side of the lilo she flips it her body now fully
submerged

END OF DV CAM

EXT UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 17

Sophie holds her breath underwater eyes forced open as the
lilo floats empty above her

CALUM
(from above water)
Sophie Now

EXT TURK HOTEL POOLSIDE - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 18

Sophie sits on the edge of the sun bed fanning through the
pages of the camera manual Calum sits behind her applying a
viscous high-factor sun tan lotion to her back

SOPHIE
(reading performatively)
“Digital video entertainment”
CALUM
Don’t get that wet It was
expensive
Sophie mouths expensive as Calum says it
Another burst of drilling
CALUM (CONTD)
I’m sorry about the hotel Soph
Clive was just here and said he had
a great time

He squeezes a dollop of lotion into his hand

SOPHIE
Come on is that not it done

He applies a second coat

SOPHIE (CONTD)
No-one believes I’ve been anywhere

with you

(beat)
Mum says I come home whiter than I
left

CALUM

We should phone her this afternoon

(beat)
Let her know you got here safe and
sound

Sophie shrugs

CALUM (CONTD)
Everything okay at home

SOPHIE
What do you mean

CALUM
I mean how are you and your mum
getting along

SOPHIE
Fine I guess Yeah

CALUM
That’s good Im glad

SOPHIE
(defensive)
Why what did she say

CALUM
She didn’t say anything You told
me you weren’t getting along that
well the last time I saw you
Remember I can’t exactly ask you
when I phone you at home

SOPHIE
Oh right yeah No it’s been
better

On the other side of the pool another family sets up their
sun beds ANDREA - 10 in a purple floral dress - and MARCIA -
5 already in swim wear - with their parents early 40s

CALUM
Why don’t you go and introduce
yourself

SOPHIE
Dad They’re like kids

A pause

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Why don’t you go and introduce
yourself

The father inflates arm bands for Marcia the little one The
mother unpacks some belongings from a bag

CALUM
(mimicking)
Sophie They’re like old

They laugh together

SOPHIE
Swap

Calum squeezes the sun tan lotion into Sophie’s hand She
kneels behind him and plays a game of noughts and crosses
with the lotion on his back then superficially rubs it in

On the other side Calum watches as the father coaxes Marcia
into the pool

CALUM
Done

SOPHIE
Yep

Sophies sits back down Calum’s back is streaked with the
vague outline of a hand print

Eventually Marcia drops herself into the pool Andréa dive
bombs in after her causing her little sister to burst into
tears

A HOTEL BARTENDER approaches with two drinks and places them
on a small table wedged between their sun beds a beer and a
milkshake complete with a cocktail umbrella and translucent
palm-tree-shaped stirrer Sophie licks the milkshake off her
stirrer to get a better look

Calum nudges her She ignores him He nudges again

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Tesskuredrim (-- Thank you)

BARTENDER
Rica ederim (-- You’re welcome)

EXT STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 19

Sophie points in wonder to the cloud of paragliders drifting
above them as she and Calum traverse the five or six metre
wide path that separates their hotel from The Ocean Park
Resort

CALUM (POST-LAP)
It’s te-she-koor ederim

SOPHIE (POST-LAP)
Tesh-koor ederim

CALUM (POST-LAP)
Te-she-koor ederim

At the end of the road visible now under the sun the ocean
meets the sky on the horizon

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON - CONTINOUS 20

In the bustling foyer of the Ocean Park Resort a sign by the
staffed reception desk reads “GoTurkey Welcome Meeting —
Room 018”

TWO TEENS 13ish rush past soaking wet and Calum takes hold
of Sophie’s hand to lead her around the slippery patch left

on the marble floor in their wake She immediately drops his
hand and watches after the teens as they descend a staircase
and out through a set of doors

While Calum gets his bearings Sophie gazes up at a post with
multidirectional arrows pointing toward different facilities
within the resort including a “gaming area”

SOPHIE
Can I have some money

Sophie gestures up to the sign

CALUM
Come on poppet We’re up here

He indicates to the stairs

SOPHIE

Come on Dad don’t be shan
CALUM

Sophie
SOPHIE

You’1l get the brochure thingy then
we can decide what we want to do
later We don’t both need to be
there

(beat)
Please

He thinks about it

SOPHIE (CONTD)
It’s madness madness I tell you
For the love of god Dad don’t
make me do it

CALUM
What’s that from

Sophie stares in exaggerated disbelief He shrugs

CALUM (CONTD)
Never mind
(beat)
Okay here’s the deal I give you
some money to play one game

He holds up one finger
CALUM (CONTD)
One And tonight you read a chapter
of the book I brought for you

SOPHIE
Fine

Calum fishes out some cash Before it’s fully out of his
wallet Sophie grabs it and sprints off down the corridor

CALUM
Slow down

She doesn’t

SOPHIE
“Don’t miss us won’t you”

Sophie is out of sight

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT MEETING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 21
A hotel employee stacks chairs in an empty room

Calum looks down to his watch - 4pm then up at a wall clock -
5pm

CALUM
(harshly to himself)
Fuck sake Calum
(beat)
How did you manage that

He sits defeated and dials his watch forward to the correct
time

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT GAMINGBAR AREA -— LATE AFTERNOON 22

Sitting on a motorbike arcade machine knuckles white on the

handlebars in pole position Sophie dips into a tight turn
with intense focus

Behind her a group of teens play pool — OLLY 15 a buzzcut
blond de-facto group leader LAURA 15 with a fringe and
high ponytail and three others TOBY JANE SCOTT - all
around the same age

On screen Sophie’s bike skids off road and crashes into a
tire wall several bikes pass her She slams the handlebars
in frustration

LAURA
(laughing)
Ouch

Assuming that “ouch” had been directed at her Sophie turns
around She sees Laura mocking Toby who had scuffed the
white

Sophie’s attention shifts back to the screen as the game
times out 2-1-GAME OVER

Back over at the pool table Olly jumps Toby from behind and
grabs hold of his cue “romantically” instructing him how to
properly take a shot

TOBY
Get to fuck

Toby pushes him off

TOBY (CONTD)
(to Scott)
I’m going for a piss Don’t fucking
take my shot I’1ll have you

OLLY
I bet you will you fucking turd
tapper

The others laugh as Toby leaves giving Olly the finger as he
walks away Sophie takes it all in now watching Laura who
laughs along with them - short shorts a white blouse sporty
trainers

Behind the teens Sophie spots Calum entering the area
Hurriedly she adds more coins to the machine and hits start
to begin another game

He approaches from behind setting himself up to playfully
spook her

SOPHIE
That was a bit quick

CALUM
You don’t miss a thing do you

Sophie concentrates intently

EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT DINING AREA - NIGHT 23

The poolside dining area is bustling with holiday-goers
tanned arms and legs burnt backs and noses dressed smartly
for dinner in trousers shirts dresses

A stage is set up on the far side of the patio where Belinda
and the other tour reps wearing matching uniforms of shorts
and polo-shirts are getting ready to perform for the crowd

Sophie arrives at the table where Calum is already seated
with a tray filled with dessert

SOPHIE
You’ve not mentioned Alice

Calum scrunches his nose

CALUM
Remember she had a boyfriend when
we first met

SOPHIE
Mmm hmmm I was like “Who was that
on the phone” And you were all
smiling and like “Just this girl I
like but she’s already going out
with someone”

Calum smiles amused and a little embarrassed

CALUM
Well they got back together

SOPHIE
Oh
(beat)
I liked her

CALUM
Me too

SOPHIE
Does that mean you’re not going to
open the cafe

CALUM
The cafe
(beat)
Oh right Yeah no Not any more
But I’ve got something new going
with Keith

SOPHIE
What is it

CALUM

We’re still figuring it out
exactly but we’re thinking of
renting a house a bit outside of
London to work from

(beat)
You’d have your own room for when
you come down

Calum gauges Sophie’s reaction

SOPHIE
Can I paint it yellow

CALUM
Yellow Why yellow

SOPHIE
I don’t know Mum won’t let me
paint my room yellow I just like
the idea of a yellow room

CALUM
You trying to get me into trouble

Sophie looks up at him innocently

SOPHIE
Can I though

CALUM
Well see

He nods conspiratorially Sophie grins — she knows how to get
what she wants

The tour reps begin their show lip synching and dancing to a
song’s well-known choreography Some guests stand at their
tables and join in

Sophie spots Laura and Scott at dinner with their parents
They appear much younger in this context

SOPHIE
Dad

CALUM
Sophie

She hesitates for a moment

SOPHIE
What’s a turd tapper

Calum takes a sip of his beer unfazed

CALUM
Where did you hear that

SOPHIE
I don’t know Someone said it to
someone earlier I think it was
maybe a joke or something

CALUM
Well you know what gay means

SOPHIE
Obviously

Sophie blushes as she fastidiously shreds a napkin
CALUM
Well it’s a not very kind thing to
call a man who is gay
Sophie remains silent
A waiter approaches a nearby table
WAITER
(to the seated family)
Room number
Calum shoots Sophie a look as though they both just
remembered that this isn’t their hotel He leans in close and
whispers in her ear a look of glee and mischief on her face
He picks up two small bread rolls gives one to her
She looks to him for reassurance He nods

She lobs the roll toward the stage but it lands short

Calum throws his and without waiting to see where it lands
he pulls Sophie toward the exit

EXT STREET - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 24

Laughing hysterically hand in hand they sprint back across
the street Sophie trips but Calum catches her and scoops
her up He carries her back through the entrance to The Tiirk
Hotel

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT - LATER 25

Calum lies awake on a narrow fold-out spring bed Sophie is
sound asleep on the main bed one arm hanging off the
mattress a hefty adult-looking book on the floor

Calum holds the video camera close to his face and watches
playback on its pull-out screen The volume is at 100 he
turns it down

DV CAM (Late afternoon earlier the same day)

- A shaky camera approaches the bathroom door of their hotel
room it’s ajar The shower is running Sophie with camera
in hand is reflected faintly in the steamed bathroom mirror
while Calum’s broken right arm in its cast sticks out of
the shower curtain at a right angle

SOPHIE (0S)
Ladies and gentleman my father
the marvellous wondrous one-
armed Calum Aaron Patterson

Calum smiles

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
Preparing for the evening’s
entertainment getting ready for
the one the only

- The camera flips around onto Sophie’s face

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Torrelimonos

She laughs shrilly mimicking Belinda

CALUM (0S)
(from the shower)
Soph you okay

- She keeps the camera on her face an expression of mock
guilt then neutral She observes her own features for a
moment then opens her mouth and zooms in until the screen is
virtually black The recording stops

Calum rewinds

SOPHIE (0S)
Ladies and gentleman my father
the marvellous wondrous one-
armed Calum Aaron Patterson

Content he turns the camera off He closes his eyes and lies
still for a long moment

The sound of dogs fighting on the street below intrudes
through the balcony door standing slightly ajar to allow in
a breeze Calum’s eyes pop open

He stretches over resisting getting out of bed and tries
unsuccessfully to force the door shut

He stands closes the door properly and returns to sit on
the edge of the bed Now only the red light of the digital
clock remains It’s 307

He throws a t-shirt in the clock’s direction It covers it
for a moment but slowly then all at once the t-shirt slides
back onto the floor

The red light of the clock glows

INT RAVE 26

The strobe continues to cast the space in and out of
darkness offering up momentary glimpses of Adult Sophie as
she pushes through the messy crowd her eye line steady

We see others in the space and eventually on the other side
of the room at a distance her target It’s Calum — his age
and appearance as we know him in Turkey

Somebody crosses in front of her then him further
obstructing him from her view She strains to keep him in
sight

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING 27
Calum is in the bathtub Water beats down onto his chest from
the shower above debossing the area where the heavy stream

meets his skin

The water level rises

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - A LITTLE LATER 28

The tub is now full the shower off Calum’s broken arm hangs
over the edge A small wet cloth covers his face

As he inhales a concave dome forms over his mouth He
breathes slowly and steadily a makeshift meditation

A knock on the door

SOPHIE (0S)
Dad are you in there I need to
pee

Calum takes the cloth from his face He looks exhausted

CALUM
Yeah just give me a sec

He uses the cloth to fully clear his eyes then pulls the
plug The water drains noisily He slaps his cheeks not too
hard forcing himself to liven up

SOPHIE (0S)
Are you in the bath I hate baths
What are you taking a bath for in
the morning

The water level falls The drain continues to gurgle

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
I was thinking about the
activities Do you think we can do
the diving and the mud baths The
diving would mean taking your cast
off right Have you worked out how
to do that yet

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT FOYER - LATE MORNING 29

Sophie stands in a windowless corridor in front of the
elevator where three pay phones are lined against the wall

SOPHIE

Whoops Well it’s fine I’1l do it

Sophie looks over to Calum who practices a Tai Chi commencing
form move in front of the reflective elevator doors

SOPHIE (CONTD)

Oh my god he’s doing some weird
slow motion ninja thing Why’s he

(beat)
But yeah he’s good

(beat)
Okay Love you too

Sophie lowers the phone

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Mum wants to talk to you

Sophie hands the phone to Calum She makes a motorbike motion
- both hands gripping invisible handlebars twisting the
accelerator forward with her right Calum fishes out some
change from his pocket Sophie takes it and rushes off

CALUM
Checking up on me
INT OCEAN PARK RESORT GAMINGBAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER 30

Sophie sneaks up on Calum

CALUM (CONTD)
Alright love you

sight of Sophie directly behind him

He flips her over and grabs her heels dangling her upside
down as he walks

Sophie’s shoulders fall in disappointment

WAITER
That’s not correct

CALUM

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT GAMINGBAR AREA - AFTERNOON 33
Two boys MICHAEL and JOHN - around Sophie’s age perhaps a
little older - occupy the arcade motorbikes They both finish
in the middle of the pack

Sophie hovers behind them watching

As their game concludes John jumps off

JOHN
Right Are you coming to the
volleyball

MICHAEL

One more I’1l meet you there
Sophie takes a seat inserts her coins into the machine

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Have you played before It’s that
one to start

SOPHIE
I know

Sophie gets off to a slow start but works her way back up the
field As the bikes loop the track Michael groans at one
sloppy turn after another

Sophie concentrates in silence and rallies into first place
She doesn’t make the leaderboard and huffs in disappointment
Michael finishes fifth

MICHAEL

Calum passes with drinks

CALUM

SOPHIE
See you

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT GAMINGBAR AREA - AFTERNOON 34

A sign-up sheet for Friday’s pool tournament is pinned to a
cork board alongside the hotel’s game and entertainment
schedules Sophie’s name is scrawled at the top

Drawing her cue back and forth Sophie takes aim at a solid
resting against a cushion at the far end of the table She
adjusts the angle of her thumb which supports the cue

CALUM
You remember how to pot these

She doesn’t

CALUM (CONTD)

Here

(beat)
If the ball you’re aiming for is
touching the cushion you have to
hit not too hard - quite soft
actually - you have to hit the ball
and the cushion at the same time

(beat)
Basically you’re aiming for the
cushion

SOPHIE
Okay Yeah yeah

She steps away

CALUM
Wait Come back
(beat)
You see if the ball isn’t touching
the cushion if it’s a wee bit off
like this

He gives the ball an inch of space

SOPHIE
Hey
CALUM
It’s fine We’re just practising

(beat)
If the ball is here you have to
hit it first Hit it directly

Calum thinks on this for a moment then moves the ball back
to its original position

CALUM (CONTD)
Ready

Sophie lines up the shot Calum’s finger hovers over her
mark

In her peripheral vision she sees the teens she had observed
the day before enter the bar area - Olly Laura Scott Toby
and Jane

She returns her gaze to the white focusses and strikes The
solid runs down the remaining length of the cushion and drops
into the pocket

CALUM (CONTD)
Brilliant

Sophie quickly and confidently pots another ball Calum
watches repeatedly chalking his cue then rubbing it off his
finger coated in blue dust

Sophie lines up for the black rushing now

CALUM (CONTD)
You’re rushing now

She looks up at him He taps the middle pocket

CALUM (CONTD)
The white

Sophie strikes At exactly the same time the black knocks in
and the white rebounds forcefully into the middle pocket

Sophie groans resting both hands on top of her head
SOPHIE
I’m
(beat)
I’m going to the loo

CALUM
Another

She waves as she walks away indicating yes Calum places
coins in the machine and presses the tray The balls clatter
as they are released into the table

INT TOILET - MOMENTS LATER 35

Sophie sits on the toilet

SOPHE

(quietly to herself)
I’m going to the loo

(now imitating the teens

from the day before)
I’m going for a piss

(beat)
Yeah I’m going for a piss

Two teenage girls enter - MAXINE and LUCY both around 1314
They individually occupy the other stalls

Silence

MAXINE (0S)
So are you going to do anything

LUCY (0S)
What do you mean

MAXINE (0S)
With George He told Seb he wants
to With you I mean Not with Seb
Obviously

LUCY (0S)
Right

Sophie pulls out a piece of toilet paper blocking a hole in
the door where the barrel of the lock has been removed
Through the hole she sees Lucy exit her cubicle approaching
the sink to wash her hands

MAXINE
Last night on the way home I gave
Kenny

Maxine approaches the sink making a hand gesture Sophie can
only half make out

MAXINE (CONTD)
Literally in the bushes behind that
other pool

LUCY
Well what like happened

MAXINE
What do you mean

LUCY
Like did he come

MAXINE
Yeah

Maxine steps directly behind Lucy and wipes her wet hands
down the back of Lucy’s shirt

MAXINE (CONTD)
I mean obviously

LUCY
in response to the hands
Pp
Hey

Maxine pulls back Lucy’s hair
MAXINE
You should wear your hair back
sometimes You look really pretty
with your hair back

Lucy and Maxine contemplate their combined reflection

Sophie flushes exits her cubicle and approaches the sink to
wash her hands The girls make a quick exit

LUCY (0S)
(quietly as the door
closes)

Oh my god do you think she heard

MAXINE (0S)

Who cares she’s like nine She
has literally no idea what we’re
talking about

Sophie looks at herself in the mirror boxy oversized t-
shirt football shorts “No Fear” cap
INT OCEAN PARK RESORT GAMINGBAR AREA - MOMENTS LATER 36

Sophie returns to the pool table where Calum jerks the
triangle forward to lock the balls in formation

Olly and Toby approach Olly gestures to the table
OLLY

(to Calum)
Do you mind

CALUM
Yeah yeah no bother

Olly places a stack of four coins next to the chalk

CALUM (CONTD)
Right last one for now then
Sophie looks to the boys pints in hand

SOPHIE
Do you want a game of doubles

Calum looks to Sophie In turn Olly checks in with Calum who
offers a surprised shrug

OLLY
(to Toby)
Why not
TOBY

I don’t know mate you’ve a gota
built-in rest there

He points to the cast on Calum’s hand Calum laughs
CALUM
No danger I’m right handed And
I’m playing with a kid right Go

He winks to Sophie She glares

OLLY
(to Sophie)
Right Do you want to take the

break
Sophie cues up her expression serious
OLLY (CONTD)

(to Calum)
What’s your sister’s name

CALUM
It’s Sophie

An extended pause For a moment Calum is a peer

CALUM (CONTD)
I’m her dad though actually

OLLY
Shit right Sorry

They both laugh

CALUM
Youre fine

An awkward silence

CALUM (CONTD)
It’s a nice hotel eh

OLLY
I’m actually staying across the
street but it’s basically a
building site so
Calum smiles

TOBY
Olly

Toby nods to the table Sophie has potted three balls off the
break

OLLY
Fucking hell Sophieimpressive

TOBY
Mate don’t say

Toby mouths “fuck”
OLLY
(to Calum)
Sorry about that
Olly winks to Sophie who plays it cool but struggles to hide
her thrill at the feeling of being part of it
37 INT HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 37

A close-up of a tussle on first look a real struggle

Calum’s unbroken hand clasps Sophie’s wrist as she labours to
free it She pulls but to no avail

CALUM
You have to twistlike here

SOPHIE
Alright I get it

CALUM
Again

Perplexed by this lesson and not taking it particularly
seriously Sophie takes Calum’s wrist again

CALUM (CONTD)
So the thin part lines up against
where the fingers connect and then
you pull as hard as you can

He pulls a little too forcefully easily slipping out of her
hold

SOPHIE
Ow

Her smirk disappears

CALUM
This is serious Sophie It’s
important you get this

SOPHIE
Why

INT HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 38

Sophie sits cross-legged on the bed Calum dabs a bottle of
face cleanser onto a round of cotton wool dabbing it gently
on her closed eyelids

CALUM (POST-LAP)
So you can defend yourself So that
if anyone ever tries to attack you
you can break free and get away
You hear me

SOPHE (POST-LAP)
What if someone tries to attack me
some other way Without grabbing my
wrists

EXT TURK HOTEL POOLSIDE - UNDERWATER - MORNING 39

Calum takes a photograph of Sophie underwater

Holding her breath she beckons for the camera Calum poses
for her

Together they rise to the surface their legs treading water
in frame

EXT TURK HOTEL POOLSIDE - DAY - A LITTLE LATER 40

Calum and Sophie lie poolside in the same position on their
backs one arm draped over their stomachs their respective
left arms shielding their eyes from the sun

Paragliders decorate the sky

SOPHIE
Could we do that

CALUM
You’re too young poppet

They continue to watch as the gliders descend in waves

SOPHIE
I think it’s nice that we share the
sky

Calum turns to Sophie

CALUM
What do you mean

SOPHIE
Well sometimes at playtime I’11
look up to the sky and if the sun
is out I’11 think about the fact
that you can see the same sun So
that even if we aren’t in the same
place we kind of are you know
Were like under the same sky

Sophie continues to rattle through the tongue twister

Calum tugs at his t-shirt uncomfortably

CALUM
Soph how does my back look

He lifts up his shirt It’s red with a distinct outline of a
hand print

SOPHIE
Mmmm A wee bit red

Neck twisted Calum eyes his reflection in a car window

CALUM
A wee bit red

SOPHIE
It’s like a temporary tattoo

CALUM
It’s your grubby wee hand print
INT HAMAM STEAM ROOM - A LITTLE LATER 42

In an empty steam room Sophie sits opposite Calum who is
stretched out on his back asleep They’re both covered in a
film of sweat

SOPHIE
Are you asleep You’re not supposed
to fall asleep

CALUM
I’m just relaxing Trying to

TWO OLDER MEN enter both in speedos

One offers a nod the other sits right down occupying the
spot beside Sophie

Calum sits himself up

CALUM (CONTD)
Here Soph

Sophie moves beside Calum

The second man takes her place glances toward both Calum and
Sophie

Calum checks in with Sophie who uses her teeth to pull out
the thread of an evil eye bracelet hanging loosely from her
wrist

Visibly tense Calum continues to survey the men on the other
side of the room

One glances toward Sophie and Calum instantly rises
CALUM (CONTD)
Let’s go through
INT HAMAM SHOWER - A LITTLE LATER 43
Calum stands under the shower He takes a slow deep breath
Sophie watches him suspiciously

SOPHIE
Isn’t it supposed to be cold

CALUM
Mmm hmm But it’s nice You’1ll see

Sophie sticks a toe in the water stream She shrieks

SOPHIE
It’s freezing

Calum steps out and drapes a towel around his shoulders

CALUM
Ready

SOPHIE
No way

CALUM

half
Sophie leaps out

SOPHIE
That was five

CALUM
It was technically four-and-a-half

Sophie scowls through her shivers

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 44

Calum sits perched on the edge of the bathtub with his head
hanging low and his right arm dangling in a bucket filled
with water

A strip of plaster cast on his arm loosens He peels it as
far as he can and allows it to float in the murky liquid

The bathroom door stands open

SOPHIE (0S)
Did it hurt

CALUM
Did what hurt

SOPHIE (0S)
When you fell

INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 45

Sophie is on the bed flipping through a teen magazine The
book Calum gave her sits closed at her side

CALUM (0S)
When I broke my wrist

SOPHIE
Uh huh

CALUM (0S)
I guess I don’t really remember I
didn’t think it was broken I had
never broken anything before

SOPHIE
I have never broken anything

A long pause

SOPHIE (CONTD)
So how come you and Mum say “love
you”

CALUM (0S)
What

SOPHIE
Like on the phone Well like you
aren’t together sowhy do you
say it

CALUM (0OS)
Think of all the people you say it
to Nana grandad your uncles
aunties

SOPHIE
But they’re family

INT HOTEL BATHROOM —- CONTINUOUS 46
Calum tugs impatiently at the slowly unravelling plaster

CALUM
Well your mother is family

With his free hand he leans forward and grabs his toiletries
bag He balances it on his knee and fumbles a pair of
scissors from it

SOPHIE (0S)

I remember once when I was younger
I asked Mum if she’d phoned you I
don’t remember why And she said
you were engaged I thought it
meant you were getting married
Like that the two of you were
getting married

(beat)
I don’t really remember though if
it was just you or you both that I
thought that about

(beat)
Isn’t that funny

Calum draws up his hand from the water and makes his best
effort to cut the plaster from the top with an ineffectually
small pair of nail scissors

CALUM
That you thought we were engaged

SOPHIE (0S)
Uh huh

Calum continues to jab at the plaster with the tiny blades
He jerks back his hand

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
I mean yeah That I didn’t know
that it just meant that you were on
the phone to someone else I was
kind of excited

Blood begins to stream from beneath the cast Calum wipes
clean the tip of the scissors on the palm of his hand and
places them back on the counter

CALUM
About us getting married

His hand elevated now he watches as the blood trickles down
his arm reaching his elbow and finally dropping into the
bucket

Droplets of blood disperse in the water striking in contrast
to the mix of water and dissolving plaster

INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 47

SOPHIE
I guess yeah
(beat)
I was pretty young though like
maybe 7

Another pause

CALUM (0S)
How are you getting on with the
book You enjoying it

SOPHIE
I don’t know it’s kind of hard to
understand

CALUM (0S)
Stick with it I think you’ll
really like it

In a wide two-shot covering both bedroom and bathroom Sophie
reluctantly puts down her magazine and opens up the book

SOPHIE
What does municipal” mean

Calum stares down at the bucket
Drop

INT EXT DIVE BOAT DECK - MORNING 48

The wake froths and ripples outward as the gulet — a two-
masted schooner — cuts through the dark sea

Sophie and Calum sit side by side looking out onto the open
water

Calum’s left hand rests on top of two brand new boxed diving
masks held in a thin plastic bag whipping noisily in the
breeze

His other arm is stretched along the railing his fingers
tapping absentmindedly on the white paint as his eyelids
slowly fall shut Sophie taps too imitating his rhythm
Calum smiles tired

EXT DIVE BOATWATER - DAY 49

Sophie stands perched on the bow Calum treads water

CALUM
Ready

Sophie takes several long strides back until she’s out of
Calum’s sight She takes a deep breath

A teen cuts in front of her and dive bombs into the water

In a half-skip half-run Sophie covers the remaining
distance and dive bombs in herself

CALUM (CONTD)
A proper dive Soph

SOPHIE
Dad
CALUM
What
SOPHIE
I told you I can’t
CALUM
You were diving last year

(beat)
Here

He throws her mask and snorkel

SOPHIE
No I wasn’t

Sophie rubs the water from her eyes

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Here throw me my mask

CALUM
I did

SOPHIE
What

CALUM
Stop messing around Come on

SOPHIE
Dad I’m not Where is it

Calum submerges his face

The camera sinks slowly with Sophie’s mask From the mask’s
POV Calum grabs for it but it’s just out of reach

Still from the mask’s sinking POV Calum disappears back
above water then violently reenters a moment later his lips
latched onto the mouthpiece of his snorkel
He thrashes for it Getting closer his eyes strain through
the salt his body lengthens his fingers reach but it
remains a hair beyond his grasp
At the surface Sophie sits in a serene moment of quiet
Calum resurfaces completely out of breath
SOPHIE
Did you not get it
It’s clear he didn’t
SOPHIE (CONTD)
(to herself)
Why would you even make a mask that

doesn’t float

Calum continues to heave

EXT DIVE BOAT DECK - A LITTLE LATER 50

With only moderate effort Sophie slips into a dry wetsuit
On the other side of the deck Calum struggles into an
unforgiving wet one

SOPHIE
(mumbling quietly in song)
Feeling hot hot hot

As Sophie slides her legs then arms into the neoprene she
watches a MAN intimately applying sun tan lotion to his
GIRLFRIEND’S back and neck while she holds up her hair ina
bun They share a joke

A dive instructor approaches - ONUR 30

ONUR
This should fit

He places a magenta mask onto Sophie’s face tugs at the
straps

ONUR (CONTD)
Suits well

He pops it off again and hands it to her

ONUR (CONTD)
Now spit in the glass

SOPHIE
What

ONUR
Spit in the glass then wipe it
around Instructor’s orders It
stops it fogging up when you get
down there

Sophie gathers some spit inside her mouth She smears it
across the glass with a finger

Calum does a few little jumps in a frustrated attempt to coax
his own wetsuit on He pulls at the neoprene and it slaps
against his skin

Another slap of neoprene
A MAN pulls on a t-shirt and flip flops nearby
MAN
(gesturing to Calum’s
wetsuit)
Don’t worry mate I only had a
quick wee in that one

He stands and walks past as he enters the cabin

Sophie watches Calum from the other side of the chrome air
tank rack

SOPHIE
You know I didn’t see you throw it

CALUM
Throw what

SOPHIE
The mask I know it was expensive
A pause

CALUM
It’s okay darling It’s fine I’m
just a little tired today
(beat)
Will you run up and grab the
camera I left it in the bag

Sophie disappears

Onur sees Calum struggling From a box under the seating he
pulls out a handful of plastic bags

ONUR
Here put that on your foot then
try again

Calum unsure takes the bag slips it onto his foot then
pushes it through the wetsuit leg It slides right through

CALUM
Cheers

ONUR
Trick of the trade

CALUM
Not a bad trade

ONUR
No not at all

CALUM
This is what you do then All year
around

ONUR
You sound like my anneanne my
mother’s mother

CALUM
Your grandma

ONUR
Yes She’d prefer I had a proper
job

They share a laugh

ONUR (CONTD)
Before I travelled a lot one
season somewhere one season
somewhere else but now I’m here
Back home

CALUM
Do you miss it

ONUR
Travelling

Calum nods

ONUR (CONTD)
Not as much as I was missing
family And now I have a baby
coming

A few years ago I thought I’d be 40
at least before all that but

Onur shrugs happily and returns to work
CALUM

Cant see myself at 40 to be
honest Surprised I made it to 30
EXT WATER 51

Sophie Calum and Onur float on the surface

ONUR
Okay

Calum and Sophie both give an “okay” signal - index finger
and thumb touching other fingers fanned out

Onur holds out his hand palm toward them

CALUM SOPHIE
Stop Stop

CALUM (CONTD)
I said it first

ONUR
And this

He gives them a thumbs up

CALUM SOPHIE
Up Up

EXT WATER - MOMENTS LATER 52

They each place their regulators in their mouths and take a
few noisy breaths from their respective air tanks Then
holding the deflator hoses above their heads they expel the
air from their jackets and gradually descend underwater

EXT UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 53

Less than 10m below the surface Onur gestures “Okay” to
Calum and Sophie They each return the signal but as Sophie
does she drifts upward

Onur grabs the edge of her BCD and pulls her down He takes
her deflator hose and holds it above her head again He
presses the button and as the bubbles of air escape the
jacket she regains buoyancy

Onur leads them over to a coral reef and takes her hand He
bunches it into a fist and extends her index finger “Wait”
he gestures She looks to Calum who shrugs

Onur turns his back and reaches toward the coral

He returns with a seahorse in hand and gently wraps its tail
around Sophie’s outstretched finger Behind her mask and
regulator Sophie’s eyes bulge and her lips part with
excitement

She looks to Calum gesturing down to the seahorse Calum
gives her two big thumbs up He takes a photograph

Onur clarifies “Go up” Calum corrects himself with two
enthusiastic “okays”

Calum continues to watch Sophie who is in turn reflected in
his mask A moment of shared serene joy

Sophie opens the door to the tiny toilet

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)

She catches her reflection in the mirror and waves

She exits and ascends a short flight of stairs

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)

from emmmm how do I describe it
the most like amazing brilliant
experience I’ve ever had

There was a sea horse and its tail
was actually wrapped round my
finger And then there was an
octopus like a real live octopus
that the instructor put on my head

Anyway now I’m here and Dad I
mean -

style)
Mr Calum Aaron Patterson is on a
deep sea dive

Even though he doesn’t really have
a diving license He

She zooms all the way into her face

SOPHIE (CONTD)
Told a porky pie

She zooms back out

CUT TO

SOPHIE (CONTD)
But he’1ll be back soon He’1ll be
fine

The camera holds still for a moment A flicker of doubt gives
way to a contrived grin

The camera pans toward the sea zooming in until it’s too
abstract to make out

END OF DV CAM

EXT UNDERWATER 55

Calum fully kitted out in SCUBA gear alone descends in
open water

Deeper

Deeper until he is entirely enveloped by darkness

MUSIC from the rave fades in at first slowed warped by the
water’s weight then

INT RAVE 56

Adult Sophie continues to push on through the ever-tightening
crowd Each person requires more effort to overcome

Through the gaps she glimpses Calum dancing with abandon
but as we close in on him it doesn’t feel as free as it did
on first glance It feels desperate endless

EXT ROOFTOP CAFE - AFTERNOON 57

Sophie and Calum sit cross-legged on floor cushions behind a
low table on an outdoor deck

More paragliders descend from the sky above
Calum drinks a Turkish tea and Sophie a milkshake As at the

hotel the milkshake is adorned with fancy stirrers and
umbrellas

On the other side of the cafe a HOLIDAY COUPLE smokes
nargileh Sophie watches while she clumsily shuffles a deck
of cards

SOPHIE
What is that

CALUM
It’s just another kind of smoking
and —

SOPHIE
Smoking causes cancer and puts tar
in your lungs and causes your teeth
to go yellow and makes your
eyeballs fall out

Sophie grins a wide goofy grin

CALUM
Exactly
(beat)
We’1ll go somewhere else next time

SOPHIE
It’s not that bad When was the
last time you were up to visit
Nana

Sophie takes a slow imaginary drag of a cigarette and blows
it in Calum’s face

Calum has no riposte This hit a little close

Sophie hands him the cards He splits them into two stacks
and thumbs them simultaneously into a single pile

CALUM
Right trouble
(beat)
Watch again
Calum perfectly combines the split deck once more
Sophie takes the cards and tries to do the same
SOPHIE
Do you think we can go diving

again

A pause

SOPHIE (CONTD)
I mean some other time On another
holiday

CALUM
Oh definitely Somewhere even
better Hawaii

SOPHIE
Wow That would be amazing

They both consider the likelihood of this
At a table to their left TWO FEMALE FRIENDS inspect the
residual grounds in a coffee cup Speaking Turkish one woman

reads the other’s fortune

Sophie tries to combine the split stacks but loses a few
cards Calum picks them up

CALUM

When are you back at school

CALUM
What would you think about applying

CALUM (CONTD)

Sophie spills more cards onto the floor She reaches down to
pick them up

INT HOTEL BATHROOM —- CONTINUOUS 62

Two angled mirrors flank the large rectangular one set into
the wall creating an infinity effect whereby Calum’s image
is multiplied

Calum brushes his teeth and vainly tussles his hair

CALUM

What do you mean

SOPHIE (0S)
I don’t know Don’t you ever feel
just like I don’t know Like when
youve been on a real high like
something’s been amazing and then
you kind of crash And feel like
youre kind ofsinking or
something like that It’s weird I
don’t know

Calum listens He avoids his own gaze now spitting out foamy
toothpaste

CALUM
We’re here to have a good time

Abruptly he spits at his reflection in the mirror

CALUM (CONTD)
Are you ready yet

SOPHIE
I’m ready

Sophie stands at the door now which has been open the whole

Calum leaves the bathroom ushering Sophie out the door The
spit trickles down the mirror

INT HOTEL BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING 63

Light from the window creeps into the bathroom as the sun
rises the spit now dry on the mirror

The sound of drilling construction

EXT STREET - DAY 64

Calum and Sophie walk in the direction of the public beach
They pass some shops stalls cafes and small restaurants
The area isn’t overly developed

A YOUNG MAN distributes flyers advertising a nightclub “NOIZ
- DISCOUNT SHOTS ALL NITE”

CALUM
We should get something nice to
send you back to your mum with

SOPHIE
Can I get something too

CALUM
You can get something too poppet
What do you want

SOPHIE
A PlayStation

CALUM
I’1ll get you a PlayStation but do
you think me spending that much
money would be fair

SOPHIE
Come on Dad It was a joke Where
would we even get a PlayStation
round here

65 EXT POSTCARD STAND - CONTINUOUS 65

Calum and Sophie reach a postcard stand and each browse on
either side of it

SOPHIE
Did I tell you I was thinking about
getting my ears pierced when I get
home Before school starts So
this weekend I guess

CALUM
No chance

SOPHIE
(surprised)
What do you mean “no chance”

CALUM
Youre too young to be altering
your body like that

SOPHIE
Dad I’m not altering my body It’s
just my ears

CALUM
I think you’d regret it to be
honest with you Soph

SOPHIE
What are you talking about
Basically all of my friends have
their ears pierced already
Calum ignores this
SOPHIE (CONTD)
And Mum already said she’d think
about it
Calum stops
CALUM
Do you know what the first thing an
attacker would do
Sophie laughs
A pause

CALUM (CONTD)
Do you

SOPHIE
(no idea where this is
going)
Em grab my hands

She imitates the hand release Calum taught her on the second

night

CALUM
Rip your earrings straight from
your ear lobes

SOPHIE
Oh my god Dad

CALUM
If a man were to attack you that’s
the first thing he’d do He would
rip them straight out You’ve no
idea

SOPHIE
(quietly)
I don’t think that’s true

CALUM
It is

Sophie steps away to a hair braiding stall situated just
behind the postcard stand

After a beat Calum follows her

EXT HAIR BRAIDING STALL - CONTINUOUS

CALUM
Do you want one

SOPHIE
I guess

CALUM

You do or your don’t
SOPHIE
Yeah I do

Sophie hops onto a low wooden stool and chooses from a

selection of colours presented to her by the STALL OWNER

As Calum stands waiting A WOMAN - 40s approaches Calum

tries and fails to catch his eye

She

WOMAN
Would you mind taking a picture of
me here

The camera is thrust into Calum’s hand He takes the picture
and hands it immediately back

CALUM
(to Sophie)
Meet me next door when you’re done

The woman double takes Sophie not having realised she and
Calum were together The woman leaves Sophie remains alone
as the stall owner continues to weave the braid into her
hair

INT CARPET SHOP 67

Inside the shop the walls are adorned by huge exquisitely
crafted carpets hanging from ceiling to floor Calum crouches
in front of a particularly beautiful one resting on top of a
stack laid out in front of him by the SALESMAN

The salesman tells Calum about the provenance of this
particular rug

Calum’s hand glides tenderly along the wool then back
against the natural direction of the pile His eyes glisten
and patently emotional his upper body shudders as he tries
to reign himself in

Sophie enters from the staircase at the other end of the
room She joins him

CALUM
Don’t you think this one’s lovely

Sophie stares at it Calum has collected himself

SOPHIE
It is actually Yeah

CALUM
This man was telling me that each
of these carpets tells a story The
symbols motifs they represent
different things

The salesman steps away and returns with a cup of tea for
Sophie

SOPHIE
(mispronounced)
Tesekktir ederim

SALESMAN
“Tea sugar” ederim

SOPHIE
Sugar

SALESMAN

Tea sugar ederim
Tea sugar ederim

He smiles Sophie gets it

SOPHIE

CALUM

SALESMAN
This one It’s 45 million lira

Calum nods as he continues to admire it

Sophie’s eyes bulge

EXT TURK HOTEL POOLSIDE - AFTERNOON 68

The poolside is in a state of slumber — the post-lunch lull —
and the pool is empty save the reflection of an afternoon
paragliding session Guests either read or sleep on their sun
beds under the shade of umbrellas Even the construction has
momentarily ceased

Sophie and Calum enter with a bag filled with souvenir gifts
They approach the bar

SOPHIE
Who is their right mind would pay
almost £1000 for a carpet A
carpet

CALUM
It’s a rug and it’s the kind of
thing that would appreciate in
value A collectible And that’s
not really the price You haggle

SOPHIE
Are you actually thinking about it
Mum would kill you if I told her

Calum laughs

CALUM
That’s probably true Don’t tell
her

The teens — Olly Toby and Laura — pass behind the bar on
their way out presumably across to the Ocean Park Resort

SOPHIE
You going to play pool

CALUM
Come on Sophie Why don’t you
introduce yourself to those girls
over there

Andréa and Marcia sit side-by-side on a sun bed Andréa plays
a Gameboy Marcia watches Their parents sleep

OLLY
(to Calum)
She can come play for a bit if she
wants We’re only three so we can
double up

Laura looks to Olly questioning

OLLY (CONTD)
(to Laura)
She’s actually quite good

SOPHIE
(serious)
Dad
Calum agonises
CALUM

Right go on then An hour Then
come right back Do you hear me

Sophie tries not to appear over-excited as she follows the
teens out

A COUPLE in their mid-40s drink by the bar They smile at
Calum knowingly He awkwardly acknowledges them

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT GAMINGBAR AREA - A LITTLE LATER 69

Laura sits at the bar while Olly and Toby set up the table
She’s more tanned than when we first met her — freckles
wisps of hair at the top of her neck where her ponytail has
been scraped up The burntan lines of the straps of her
halter neck bikini stand out in contrast to the position of
her over-the-shoulder bra exposed just a little above the
low collar of her shirt She has stud earrings shaped like
tiny table tennis bats

Sophie stands

LAURA
Fanta lemon please

She flashes a luminous green wristband clasped around her
wrist to an OCEAN PARK BARTENDER

SOPHIE
What’s that

Sophie points to the wristband

OLLY
Taking your time girls

Olly approaches from behind and hands Laura the cue Laura
takes her drink and walks back to the table

LAURA
(as she walks away)
It’s an all-inclusive thing You
can order as much as you want of
anything

Sophie observes a strip of sweat left on the plastic bar
stool where Laura was seated

OCEAN PARK BARTENDER 1
Would you like something

SOPHIE
A Fanta lemon thanks

The sweat condensation dries up

OLLY
You’re up Sophie

Sophie grabs her drink and joins the others at the table to
take her shot

LAURA
(back toward the bar)
Well well well Who do we have
here

Scott and Jane hand in hand approach the bar from the
swimming pool

SCOTT
You alright

They order drinks keeping to themselves Jane leans in to
Scott and they begin to make out

Olly covers Sophie’s eyes and turns her around Toby flanks
her other side a double act

TOBY
(shouting toward Scott and
Jane)
Can’t be corrupting the youth
Sophie shakes free
Jane raises a middle finger as she kisses Scott The teens
continue to heckle them

INT HOTEL ROOM 70

Calum practices Tai Chi in the bedroom trying to maintain a
sense of calm Failing

He grabs his wallet Leaves

INT OCEAN PARK RESORT GAMINGBAR AREA - A LITTLE LATER 71
Sophie strikes a ball
Scott and Jane continue to make out by the bar

LAURA
Gross They’ve been snaking for a
fucking age

OLLY
(laughing)
Wait what Snaking What the fuck
is snaking

Sophie strikes another potting the white this time

LAURA
Snaking What do you call it

Seeing that the teens aren’t paying attention Sophie cheats
lifting the white back out of the pocket

OLLY
What they’re doing It’s pulling

Sophie hesitates In a brief crisis of confidence she
returns the white to the pocket

SOPHIE
It’s nipping

They turn to Sophie and all laugh together

OLLY
Nipping

Olly pinches Laura’s ass as he says it

LAURA
(embarrassed)
Oi
OLLY
Look

Scott and Jane return to the edge of the pool legs dangling
in the water ignoring the group’s whistles

OLLY (CONTD)
Come on

Olly slings his arm around Sophie’s shoulder whispering in
her ear

EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT POOLSIDE - CONTINUOUS 72

They group approaches the pool Sophie smiles She looks back
to Olly for reassurance He raises his eyebrows in
affirmation

Sophie sneaks up behind Scott then suddenly and with force
pushes him into the water

Olly follows through with Jane then engages in a momentary
play struggle with Laura Sophie watches as Laura squeals and
she and Olly tumble in together Toby dive bombs in after
them

Sophie is left standing on the edge of the pool — a second
too long has passed for her to join in the spontaneous fully
clothed fun Nonetheless she jumps with a tentative lack of
commitment
SOPHIE
Woooo

EXT UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS 73

Below the surface Sophie opens her eyes bubbles and a
tangled mess of two bodies pressed close together

As she rises she sees Laura and Olly in an embrace
Scott splashes them violently They separate long enough to
splash him back Laura’s white shirt is soaked through

revealing the outline of her bra underneath

Sophie her own white t-shirt now virtually translucent
looks down to her exposed flat chest

Scott and Toby are engaged in an underwater wrestle now Olly
and Laura back to whispering in one anothers ears
EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT POOLSIDE - CONTINUOUS 74

Sophie quietly slides out of the pool She leaves drenched

INT CARPET SHOP - CONTINUOUS 75

Calum’s gaze traverses across the intricate patterns of the
carpet he and Sophie had admired a little earlier

The salesman brings him a cup of tea They shake hands

INT HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON 76

Sophie takes off her wet t-shirt and shorts as she eyes a
checked red and white dress hanging untouched in the
wardrobe

She puts on her bikini top as if it were a bra then pulls
over the dress adjusting the bikini straps and dress straps
to overlap

Seemingly content with her reflection in the mirror Sophie
begins to tidy up the bedroom - folding up clothing belonging
to both her and Calum which lies strewn about the floor

She picks up a matchbook with three matches missing throws
it in the bin

Sophie reaches for the shorts she just took off and retrieves
a cocktail stirrer from their pocket She flops down onto the
bed and inspects it It’s fluorescent orange and the
silhouette of a naked big breasted woman

She pulls her rucksack onto the bed from the floor and opens
up an interior pouch She sandwiches the cocktail stirrer
between a puzzle and activity book and the erotic novel from
the reception area table that she eyed on the first night

INT HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING 77

The DV camera is hooked up to the television the bottom of
its screen partially obscured by a small stack of Calum’s
books a mix of computer programming and self-help pop
psychology On top of the pile is a guide to meditation

Behind the TV Sophie paces in and out of frame She’s back
in shorts and a t-shirt

For clarity’s sake this is a single stationary shot We
can see both the DV cam feed on the television but also
snippets of Calum and Sophie as they move around the room in
the space between the television unit and the edge of frame

DVCAM FEED
The camera captures the hotel room Calum is out of sight

Immediately self-conscious she lunges forward

SOPHIE (CONTD)

She gets her bearings with the camera again

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
Right

Father

She points the camera at Calum - the first and only time he’s
on DV cam screen He tries to dodge it with athletic jumps
side to side Then he starts hopping which gives way to a
sort of dance

Sophie laughs hysterically

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
What even is that

CALUM
These are my moves

SOPHIE (0S)
Oh my god you’re so embarrassing

At the edge of frame we see Calum sit down on the bed Only
his lower body hands clasped between his knees is visible

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
What did you do for your birthday
when you were 11 then

Calum reaches for something nearby

END OF DV CAM FEED

White noise replaces the DV footage on the television We
still see Calum’s legs at the edge of frame

SOPHIE (0S) (CONTD)
Daaaad Come on

Calum won’t budge

screams to be heard A pill in hand He leans down knocks it
back

For the first time Adult Sophie looks away

He is perfectly still

Above a waft of paragliders fall

INT TURK HOTEL DINING ROOM - MORNING 87

A teaspoon scrapes out honey from a honey comb then dollops
it onto a tray crammed full of different types of breakfast
foods from the buffet

Precariously Sophie carries her tray to the table where
Calum eyes heavy sits with just a cup of coffee He stirs
in a little cream murmurs something to himself

SOPHIE
Mum says talking to yourself is the
first sign of madness

CALUM
(eyes down)
Is that right

SOPHIE
The second is talking back Like
talking back to yourself you know

Calum doesn’t offer her much by way of a response Sophie
reaches for his hand with both of hers turns it over

SOPHIE (CONTD)
The third is hairy palms

She shrugs

SOPHIE (CONTD)
So I guess you’re not mad Not
completely anyway

She laughs almost nervously at Calum’s seeming emptiness She
pours an individual box of Coco Pops into her bowl

CALUM
Those are pure sugar Sophie Start
with something else

Sophie takes an intentionally heaped spoonful then laughs
again accidentally spewing milk across the table Her spoon
clatters noisily to the floor

CALUM (CONTD)
Sophie

Sophie’s grin flattens
SOPHIE
(under her breath)
What’s your problem this morning

She stands up and fetches another spoon from the cutlery
rack

Calum downs the rest of his coffee A waiter refills his cup
Calum’s palm lies open on the table

EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT POOLSIDE - DAY 88
It’s mid-morning and the huge pool area is unusually quiet
Sophie is reclined on a sun bed eyes at half mast A handful
of postcards are scattered by her side written and
addressed A pen slides out of her right hand and a postcard
containing only “Dear Nana” rests on her stomach She
flinches awake

Calum lies on the adjacent bed

They both have their headphones in and we alternate between
their individual tracks

Eventually Calum pulls out an ear bud

CALUM
Top up time

He opens the cap of the lotion

SOPHIE

She takes the bottle and squeezes some lotion into her hands
She tries to apply it to her back but can’t fully reach

EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT POOLSIDE - DAY 89

A competitive game of water polo is underway Calum and
Sophie both join in with other kids and adults all male

Sophie is laser focussed but struggles to get a look in on
any of the balls The ball is passed around and over her up
and down the pool Eventually it comes to an OVEREAGER MAN
30ish He slams it hard and it hits Sophie square in the
face

EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT POOLSIDE - MOMENTS LATER 90

Sophie is hunched over sobbing

A WOMAN 50s at a nearby sun bed who has been watching this
unfold steps in

She gives Sophie a tissue and sets her up to stem the
bleeding Calum’s face is ashen

SOPHIE
Come on it’s a laugh And I chose
one of your songs We’re on
holiday Remember We’re supposed
to be having fun Isn’t that what
you said

Sophie stands defiantly and approaches the stage fully
expecting Calum to join her

A small television screen reads “INTRO” Sophie takes the
microphone The intro to REM’s “Losing My Religion”

SOPHIE (CONTD)
“Oh life is bigger
Its bigger
Than you and you are not me”

She waves for Calum to join her He doesn’t

Sophie just about holds the tune but she’s not good and
what might be cute in a younger kid is less so now

She does her best to make the most of the moment but becomes
increasingly self-conscious over the course of the song

By the second verse she stares intently at the screen
displaying the lyrics It’s excruciating but she endures the
entire track

Finally she rejoins Calum solemnly on the verge of tears

CALUM
You know we could get you singing
lessons if you wanted to learn to
sing

SOPHIE
Are you saying I can’t sing

CALUM
Anyone can learn to sing if they
put in the work

SOPHIE
Stop doing that

Doing what

and scrunches her face in effort

An uproar from the boys at the centurion table

She pulls her hand back

free from her wrist

LAURA (CONTD)

all over me

He turns to Sophie

EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT - GROUNDS - NIGHT 96

Sophie walks alone through the hotel grounds The path is
lined by trees and shrubs and small ground lights positioned
at even intervals It is dark and she is lost

She reaches a fork in the path hesitates for a moment then
veers right

From behind a patter of two or three steps but before she
can turn a hand covers her mouth and another grasps her
wrist

Sophie struggles throws her head back swings wildly and
pulls hard with her arm a panicked attempt at the move Calum
taught her

But her wrist doesn’t slip out Instead the force thrusts
her perpetrator to the ground It is Michael flat on his
back stunned trying to laugh through it

SOPHIE
Fuck You fuckingfucking
dickheadfuck

A group of six other kids all 11-12 laugh from further back
up the path at the fork Michael leaps to his feet his back
to them

MICHAEL
I’m sorry

Sophie catches her breath She smiles making her best effort
to collect herself quickly playing it cool

SOPHIE
Idiot

She punches him hard
MICHAEL
I’m sorry I’m sorry
(beat)
Where you going
SOPHIE
Back to my hotel But I don’t
know I got lost I guess It all
looks the same at night

EXT STREET - NIGHT 97
Calum walks down the path leading to the shore

A woman drops a cigarette butt still alight Calum retrieves
it takes the remaining drag or two

He continues past a taxi stand where a DRIVER eats a late
night snack and smokes
EXT OCEAN PARK RESORT - COVERED POOL - NIGHT 98

Sophie and Michael sit alone side-by-side in a small covered
pool area

Shoes and socks set to the side their legs dangle in the
water a turquoise glow cast across their skin

SOPHIE
I didn’t know there was another
pool back here

Sophie glances away nervously up to the ceiling
MICHAEL
Yeah it’s quiet in the day I’m
not a great swimmer so it suits me
SOPHIE
I’m not that good either And I

still can’t dive

MICHAEL
We better not fall in then eh

Sophie continues to edgily survey her surroundings

MICHAEL (CONTD)
So uh I quite like you

Michael’s eyes are locked on Sophie She doesn’t meet his
gaze

MICHAEL (CONTD)
Do you like me

Sophie hesitates

SOPHIE
(unconvincing)
Yeah

Michael leans in blocking most of Sophie’s face Their heads
each lean to their respective rights and just one of Sophie’s
eyes unwaveringly open is visible to camera Her gaze rolls
toward the pool

To the sound of the sloppy lapping of tongues the camera
pans across the water until it reaches the reflection of a
skylight directly above Six silhouettes peer down through
the glass

In a wide of the entire exterior structure a few of the kids
begin to drum on the glass and whoop raucously

After a beat longer Sophie pulls away

MICHAEL
Have you done that before

SOPHIE
Yeah
(beat)
Once
(beat)
You

MICHAEL
With a couple of girls back home

In silence Sophie and Michael replace their socks and shoes
On their way out they cross paths with two other kids from
the group Their turn

EXT PUBLIC BEACH - NIGHT 99
Calum reaches the low wall separating the street from the
sand and leapfrogs it carelessly grazing his shoulder as he

tumbles to the other side

He strips off his t-shirt and kicks off his shoes and in just
his boxer shorts walks calmly across the sand

He enters the water wading through the foam then lunges
beyond it disappearing from sight

It’s almost pitch black save the moonlight reflecting off
the whitewater as it continues to roll noisily into shore

INT TURK HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER 100
Sophie stands outside the hotel room door knocking

There’s no response She knocks again Still nothing

INT TURK HOTEL RECEPTION - MOMENTS LATER 101
Sophie exits the stairs into the reception area it’s empty

SOPHIE
Hello

She waits another moment then exits

EXT TURK HOTEL GROUNDS - MOMENTS LATER 102

Sophie passes alongside the back of the hotel bar She
pauses

The door of a storage space built into the bar hut stands a
crack open Sophie holds her breath and peers through She

sees two men kissing slow passionate one’s hand clasped

behind the other’s head She leans in entranced It’s Toby
and the redhead Alex

EXT TURK HOTEL POOLSIDE - LATER 103

Sophie sleeps on the wicker-backed couch in the reception
area

RECEPTIONIST
(softly)
Miss
EXT TURK HOTEL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 104

The receptionist stands some distance behind Sophie as she
inserts the key card into the door retracting it quickly
The light flashes red then green She pushes down the handle

RECPETIONIST
Good night

SOPHIE
Good night
INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 105

Immediately Sophie sees Calum sprawled across the bed
naked

It’s dark and she steps forward swiftly draping the bed
sheet on top of him

She leans over him to grab her pyjamas from the bed then
drops onto the fold-out bed below

Calum takes heavy uneven breaths

INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 106
The camera pushes in on Calum then pans down to the floor

A transition on the movement

107 INT NEW YORK CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT 107
The camera lands on a carpet the same carpet Calum had been
staring at in the shop Sodium vapour infiltrates a gap ina
curtain off screen creating an orange slither on the
patterned wool

Two legs hang down from the end of the bed The toes grab at
the wool poking the pattern methodically outlining a shape
The figure leans down but only hands wrapped around shins
are visible
WOMAN (0S)
(half asleep)
You okay

ADULT SOPHIE (0S)
Yeah

WOMAN (0S)
Hey Happy birthday

A kiss on the cheek
The sound of an infant crying

ADULT SOPHIE
I’1l bring him through

Adult Sophie stands and leaves

The room begins to strobe in and out of darkness

108 INT RAVE 108
Adult Sophie nears Calum still dancing
More dancers crowd Calum now More obstacles

The sound of breathing heavy erratic dictates the
soundscape

The pace slows What was half speed is now quarter speed the
pitch falling warping

The breaths endure

Extreme close ups of Calum’s eyes straining wide open his
ashen skin sweat trickling down his sideburns down his
jawline finally dripping onto his already soaked shirt He
looks like death

INT HOTEL ROOM - EARLY DAWN (PRE-SUNRISE) 109
DVCAM
Calum operates the camera

Stomach down face scrunched to the side Sophie breathes
quietly and evenly Her eyelids twitch

The camera jitters Calum steadies his hand

The hotel room phone rings Calum reacts quickly to the too-
loud tone and drops the camera onto the bed

The recording continues but captures only wrinkled bed
sheets

CALUM (0OS)
Hello

RECPETIONIST (0S)
This is your wake up call Mr
Patterson Your lunch is ready at

A groan
CALUM (OS) (CONTD)
Time to get up Come on Let’s go
END OF DV CAM

INT BUS - DAWN 110

The sky’s hue fades from pink to yellow as the sun begins to
rise

Sophie and Calum sit on a coach identical to the airport
transfer bus Sophie’s cap covers her face

The bus trundles along the motorway - trees and rubble lining
the road Like Sophie almost every passenger fights for more
sleep

Calum’s head is tilted back and he stares up at the ceiling
eyes wide open then gradually closed

The tiny twist vent hisses air directly onto his face Wisps
of his hair flutter caught in its narrow stream

Sophie pulls the cap off her face She sees Calum ostensibly
asleep and retrives his sunglasses out of his top pocket

She fiddles with their sharply pointed legs then places them
on her face lifting them off and on off and on

CALUM

(deadpan without opening

his eyes fully)
Careful with those A man died not
paying attention to how he put them
on The end of the leg went
straight up his nose and punctured
his brain

SOPHIE
No it didn’t

CALUM
It did

Sophie slips them back into Calum’s chest pocket

SOPHIE
Happy birthday Dad

Calum opens his eyes now

CALUM
Thanks darling

SOPHE
Hey Dad

CALUM
Yeah

SOPHIE

Remember “Torremolinos”

She imitates Belinda then laughs quietly

CALUM
(with levity)
“Belinda from Torremolinos”
A pause

CALUM (CONTD)
What made you think of that

SOPHIE
I don’t know Just being on the bus
I guess

Calum shakes out his shoulders

EXT ROADSIDE STOP - MORNING 111
The bus has stopped

As some passengers shop for snacks at a roadside stop Sophie
and Calum stand together behind the bus practising

elementary Tai Chi

Sophie watches carefully and imitates Calum’s movements

EXT COLD SPRING - MORNING 112
A large group congregates around a small natural pool THREE
MEN (20s-40s) stand in the water grimacing to varying
degrees competing for who can stay in the longest

One man lunges for the side and clambers ungracefully out
The crowd erupts

Calum and Sophie stand on the sidelines

WOMAN
Two minutes

Two men remain

WOMAN (CONTD)
Two fifteen

Cheering

WOMAN (CONTD)
Two thirty

One of the remaining men is on the verge of cracking After a
moment he too hauls himself back onto dry land

The winner lets out a guttural scream The crowd counts down
from 10

Once they reach zero he moves to get out of the pool
Frozen he needs a hand up

The crowd moves noisily on down the path towels wrapped
tightly around the participants

Sophie lingers

SOPHIE
Here take my watch

CALUM
How come

SOPHIE
Press that one when I say

Calum understands smiles

CALUM
You sure

She hesitates for a moment on the edge of the pool

CALUM (CONTD)
You’1l1l just have to —

She jumps

CALUM (CONTD)
You okay

SOPHIE
Go Press it

Calum hits start on the stop watch
Sophie grins in the water

CALUM
That’s one minute

Calum takes a photo
Sophie stays calm breathing as evenly as she can

SOPHIE
How long

CALUM
145 You’ve got one more minute

SOPHIE
Give me until three
Calum laughs

The murmur of the crowd in the distance has silenced The
sounds of the natural environment envelop them

EXT COLD SPRING - A LITTLE LATER 113
Calum wraps Sophie in a towel She beams

CALUM (POST-LAP)
You’re so much stronger than I am

EXT MUD BATHS - DAY 114

Fenced in by logs in front of lush green foliage is a grey-
brown muddy pool crammed full of tourists of every shape and
size sporting modest and less-than-modest swimwear

A YOUNG BURNT SCOT - 21 - rushes past water dripping from
his lobster red torso

BURNT SCOTTISH MAN
(back to his friend)
That sulphur shit fucking reeks
man

SOPHIE
What’s that smell

CALUM
It’s where we go after this

Sophie is too far in to back out

CALUM (CONTD)
If it’s good enough for
Cleopatra

SOPHIE
That is pretty amazing if you think
about it That she was like
actually here Like right here

CALUM
Before she was

Calum snaps at her with this hand

CALUM (CONTD)
By a snake

SOPHIE
Well kind of It was suicide And
it’s not for certain that she used
a snake No one found a snake It
might have just been a needle

A pause

SOPHIE (CONTD)
We did Egypt last term

Somebody splashes nearby and a little mud lands in Calum’s
eye He makes an effort to smear it off with the small patch
of unmuddied but grazed skin on his shoulder

SOPHIE (CONTD)
What happened to your shoulder

Calum squints

CALUM
I don’t really know
(beat)
Sorry I passed out on your bed

SOPHIE
I don’t care
(beat)
I didn’t have a key though
Calum hadn’t thought of this

CALUM
How did you get in

Sophie hesitates

SOPHIE
The receptionist

Calum sits with this for a long moment

CALUM
I’m so sorry Soph Yesterday

SOPHIE
It’s fine Dad No big deal

CALUM
It is a big deal I’m sorry I’m
sorry

Sophie nods but Calum is having trouble letting himself of
the hook

CALUM (CONTD)
Come on let’s dry off
(beat)
Wait though

He takes a little mud on his palm and smears it on Sophie’s
face - her right cheek left cheek forehead chin and
finally a stripe down her nose

EXT RAFT —- A LITTLE LATER 115

Calum and Sophie sit on a small raft tethered to the wall of
the mud baths on the shoreline

CALUM
Did you have fun last night

Sophie wraps her arms self-consciously around her mid
section

SOPHIE
This guy Michael I met him
playing on that motorbike game
(beat)
He kissed me We kissed I guess
Yeah

CALUM
(urgently)
He’s your age though

SOPHIE
Yeah

Calum is relieved

CALUM
Well that’s okay right A peck on
the cheek

SOPHIE
Yeah I mean

Calum nods slowly

CALUM
You know I want you to know that

Whatever it is you do Whatever
parties you go to boys you meet

CALUM

Well that’s okay too But if you
do remember Okay

Sophie looks down at her feet nodding solemnly a little
confused

SOPHIE
Okay Dad

EXT AMPHITHEATRE AT KAUNOS - AFTERNOON 116

The tour group files into the amphitheatre descending the
large stone steps one by one

Sophie scuttles through the crowd stops at a WOMAN - late
30s taps her on the arm and whispers something quietly in
her ear A couple of more steps down she does the same again
to another member of the group

Eventually Sophie reaches the stage

She puts her fingers in her mouth generates a piercingly
loud whistle to steal everyone’s attention then raises her
arms as if a conductor

Sophie spots Calum much higher up and signals to the crowd
In unison they sing “For he’s a jolly good fellow” Calum

stands at the top of the structure his face obscured by the
shade The crowd cheers and claps

INT HOTEL ROOM - EVENING 117

CROWD (POST-LAP)

Hip hip hooray

The sheer white layer of curtain is pulled across the window

Calum sits naked on the bed his head in his hands his back
hunched to the camera

The sound of stifled crying Calum resists For a moment he
reins it in a few quivering breaths then he can’t Calum
sobs His upper body convulses and he gasps desperately for
breath where he can

Very very slowly the camera pulls back

EXT TURK HOTEL POOLSIDE - DUSK 118

“Girl Power” t-shirt

Steve strikes and pots one of Sophie’s last two balls in
error He glances momentarily up at Calum then Sophie

Sophie steps up to the table She cues up then stops She
approaches the ball she’s aiming for and double checks her
mark

She strikes The ball falls into the pocket and the white
lines up perfectly for the black

She moves swiftly without rushing She cues back strikes
hard but not too hard and pots the black

The crowd erupts into applause Sophie and Steve shake hands

STEVE
Very well played Sophie

Sophie looks to Calum with delight He beams with pride

A TOUR REP hands an envelope to both Steve and Sophie Calum

The photographer approaches their table He gestures to his
camera a Polaroid

top layer of the square image

122 EXT STREET - NIGHT 122

Moonlight reflects off the ocean in the distance as Calum and
Sophie walk back up the road toward their hotel

The sound of music A party

EXT TURK HOTEL - NIGHT 123

Where the dining area meets the pool a disco light casts the
space in colour the same colour we identify with the rave

People dance — more people than we’ve seen gathered at The
Turk hotel yet

Calum grabs Sophie’s hand and pulls her toward the makeshift
dance floor

CALUM
Come on then Last night Time for
a dance
SOPHIE
I don’t dance
CALUM
Sophie
SOPHIE

I never ever dance
She pulls away and ducks momentarily behind a wooden support
CALUM
I’m dancing with or without you I

told you I love to dance

Calum ventures in alone Sophie covers her eyes looks
between her fingers

SOPHIE

Dad no That’s so embarrassing
CALUM

Embarrassing

further into the crowd

Sophie loses sight of him for a moment
The disco light flares the lens

Adult Sophie pushes past one last reveller standing between
her and Calum He looks pallid moves frantically sweats
profusely

his movement is too forceful too erratic

ADULT SOPHIE
(screaming inaudibly)

Stop

His face is lit up playful delighted emphatically alive

violently tries to keep him grounded fighting against his

the camera There is an AIRLINE EMPLOYEE at her side

SOPHIE
Best holiday ever

A pause

CALUM (0OS)
Give my love to your mum

The camera zooms in to keep Sophie in view as she tracks down
the corridor

Sophie gestures to the airline employee
SOPHIE
I don’t need a babysitter you

know

Eventually she passes through a busy security area She
smiles coyly just as she disappears behind the wall

The camera holds

After a moment Sophie reappears at the turn point in the
queue where the wall opens up She sticks out her tongue

She disappears again

After another minute she reappears This time she feigns
sleep though still on her feet
She disappears again
She reappears one final time waves blows a kiss Just as
Sophie is about to step away — as we saw in the opening
sequence — the footage pauses as she maintains the camera’s

direct line of sight

The almost-distorted-by-proximity-to-the-microphone breaths
stop A quieter cleaner breathing pattern can now be heard

Our camera pans slowly to the right and it is evident for
the first time that the footage is playing back on a
television

The camera pans slowly in a circle

A small neat open plan New York City apartment

A record player A guitar A stack of children’s books

We reach the sofa Adult Sophie holds the camera attached
via a cord to the TV She hold’s her younger self’s gaze

The camera continues to pan Almost one hundred and eighty
degrees later transitioning on a wall it reaches

Calum stands holding the camera He’s dressed in clothing
familiar to us from the rave He smiles waving

He takes a deep breath then another

He turns to leave

At the other end of the corridor he opens a set of double
doors Inside is the rave dark crowded loud He enters
Just as the doors are about to close behind him the camera
continues its pan back around until it lands back on

INT APARTMENT 133
Sophie remains seated on the couch

The sound of an infant crying off screen

leaves and continues to pan once she’s gone

Just before it reaches the television we transition on the
