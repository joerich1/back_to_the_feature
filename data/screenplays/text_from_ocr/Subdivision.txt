FADE IN

EXT SUBURBAN STREET - LATE NIGHT

Moving slowly past rows of identical homes All equally
quiet inside until --

CRASH Someone just threw something at someone
FRANK (0S)
(inside the house)

Nice That was my mother’s

WIFE (0OS)
That was my mother’s you asshole

FRANK (0S)
I Do not Need This

FRANK drunk stumbles from his house Peels out ina
silver Lexus SUV UC BOULDER STICKER on the rear window

EXT ROUTE 114 - NIGHT

Frank’s SUV barrels down a hilly two-lane highway

INT FRANK’S LEXUS - CONTINUOUS
“You Got Another Thing Coming” by Judas Priest blares
FRANK
(adding to the lyrics)
That’s right bitch
A SUDDEN DOWNPOUR But the big loud drops don’t bead like
water They’re viscous translucent Frank panics he’s
doing 80 and his visibility just dropped to zero

Frank SKIDS It’s bad The SUV starts to SPIN He turns
into it After a full 360 the car comes to a stop Whew

As quickly as it appeared the RAIN IS GONE Frank sees how
close he was to going off the hillside LAUGHS with relief

FRANK (CONT’D)
Ha You got another thing comin’

Psyched to have beaten the Reaper he drives on

A MOMENT LATER -- Frank gets blinded by HEADLIGHTS from
behind Adjusts his mirror to see approaching fast --

Another SUV Looks exactly like his Lexus Silver

This guy is right up Frank’s ass He swerves The other car
swerves too Frank HONKS the horn Gets a HONK in return

The other Lexus moves to pass him As it pulls alongside
Frank is surprised to see --

It’s IDENTICAL to Frank’s even has the same UC BOULDER
STICKER on the rear window Huh

But the real shock in the driver’s seat of the other car is
ANOTHER FRANK The same guy Identical

Frank looks to the road ahead tries to blink away what he
just saw The OTHER FRANK does EXACTLY THE SAME THING

Frank turns back to his doppelganger With just a fraction
of a second delay the Other Frank turns to him

FRANK (CONTD)
Hey

OTHER FRANK
Hey

Frank turns back to the road in a panic runs his hand
through his hair Other Frank does the same

Frank redlines his SUV So does Other Frank It’s like
driving next to a mirror moving 100 miles an hour

The two speeding SUVs take up both lanes Neither driver
sees the PRIUS coming the other way until it’s too late --

BOTH SUVS turn sharply right tires SCREECHING Both
simultaneously FLIP IN PERFECT SYNC --

Roll down a hill into a MALL PARKING LOT and come to a stop
right next to each other Both SUVs catch fire

Frank crawls from the wreckage Bleeding dying

The Other Frank crawls towards him seems to be studying
Frank’s confusion

The Prius stops A WOMAN gets out turns from the fiery
carnage to call 911

WOMAN
Hello There’s an accident Two
cars The Fulton Mall parking lot

She turns to look at the accident scene But there’s only
ONE CAR on fire and only ONE DEAD FRANK

Off her bewildered reaction LIFT to the sky and down on --
EXT TURNER HIGH SCHOOL - SAME NIGHT
Modern clean Lots of inviting white walls

A BOY with a black hoodie baseball cap and a big backpack
skirts the dark edges of the well-lit empty parking lot

He reaches the school pauses to look for stray faculty and --
QUICKLY LIKE WE’RE GOING TO GET CAUGHT

- Unfolds elaborate ACETATE STENCIL PANELS

- Up a ladder secures stencils on a wall with Blu-Tack

- Stencil panels form a huge unseen 10’ x 10’ picture

- Black red and blue paint from small cans fill paint trays

- Roller hits the paint then the wall

SMASH TO

EXT TURNER HIGH SCHOOL - THE NEXT MORNING

Bright sunlight shines on the last day of school A crowd of
students is looking at

A MURAL It reveals the inside of the school as an assembly
line where students have their brains removed as they get
turned into football players and cheerleaders

Half the students love it half do not Faculty members are
clearly displeased

A school door opens and JASON HALTER is escorted out by
OFFICER CAMP who slams him on a locker to cuff him

JASON
You didn’t get the metaphor

Camp hauls him off past the crowd of onlookers including --

GILES ROPER Jason’s best friend Nerdy but someday
he’1ll get Lasik and a clue Giles is distressed but Jason’s
look says not to worry

Jason even manages a smile for MAGGIE BIZANSKI his
sweet-faced girlfriend with a rebellious eyebrow pierce and a
shoulder tattoo She’s not happy

As Jason is stuffed into a waiting squad car she mouths
“What the fuck” He shrugs apologetically and is gone
INT HOLDING CELL - POLICE STATION - THAT EVENING

Jason is let out and brought to --

INT LOBBY - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS
Officer Camp chews a toothpick at his desk

OFFICER CAMP
How was the cell Halter Come up
with a metaphor for a toilet with
no seat

Jason is about to offer up a smart-ass reply when he spots a
Marine in fatigues signing for him at the front desk His
brother DANNY strong confident pissed

DANNY
Well this is the best homecoming
present I could’ve hoped for
(quieter but angrier)
Great timing Mom had to meet me
at the airfield by herself

OFFICER CAMP
Hey Danny You sure are doing a
swell job with your little brother
Danny takes the insult grabs Jason’s arm As they exit --
DANNY
(loud enough to be heard)
I hate that guy

JASON
Him and his not-ironic moustache

Danny pushes Jason through the door with a slight grin Back
to being his big brother

EXT PARKING LOT - POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS

Jasons mom ETTA waits at a Subaru Outback An earnest
smart woman who’s been doing her best after a messy divorce

She gives her younger son a silent hug looks him in the eye
ETTA
Is this the first time or the last

time

Jason squirms She takes his face in her hands
ETTA (CONTD)
This was supposed to be a good day
And I know we’ve had a lot of bad
ones but --

JASON
It’s the last time I’m sorry

Etta assesses

ETTA
OK then I went to see Principal
Laird He’s not pressing charges
(off Jasons relief)
And I saw the mural A little
derivative but not bad

EXT LOCAL HIGHWAY - DUSK

Etta drives past a mid-sized mall Target El Torito
Sports Authority Oooh a Thai place

Jason sits in back stares out the window at the tedium as
his mother and brother debate his future

ETTA
(eyes Jason in mirror)
Will you finally fill out the RISD
application

DANNY
So he can learn to spray-paint
better for forty grand a year
Mr Mid-Life Crisis only pays child
support for six more months

ETTA
It’s worth trying

DANNY
(looks back at Jason)
You gonna buy into that Going
into debt that you’1ll never pay
off You work with me at CFS and
youll make real money doing a real
job Priorities Practicality

Jason considers both paths before him

JASON
Mom he’s right

Etta hates to see her son give up on a dream
ETTA
Fill out the application If you
get in we’ll figure it out

The stores thin out Gas stations Jack-in-the-Box Houses
appear on both sides of the street

EXT SUBDIVISION - DUSK
Aerial shot of the car entering THE SUBDIVISION

Row after row of identical houses People tend their yards
kids play in the street neighbors wave to one another

Idyllic Safe Quiet But from above the grid of houses
looks like a mouth full of teeth

EXT JASON’S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING
Garage door is open Danny works on an old JEEP WRANGLER

Jason with bed-head comes in taps the last few Honey Nut
Cheerios from a single-serving box into his mouth

DANNY
Hot date

JASON
(mouth full)
Can’t hear you I’m chewing

Jason hops on his bike and takes off

EXT SUBDIVISION - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

Jason pedals past the same houses for the millionth time A
suburban labyrinth with no escape This place sucks

EXT GILES’ HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Jason walks his bike toward METAL BULKHEAD doors

INT GILES’ BASEMENT - DAY
The teenage dream of the unfinished basement room achieved

Haunted by the Ghost of Broderick Past Computers on every
horizontal surface Desktop flanked by two mounted tablets

One poster of Tyrion Lannister captioned “You talkin’ to
me” and way too many of Japanese girl-group AKB48

Giles tinkers on some Kinect Sensors Blonde hair in a top-
knot he looks like Friday night bled into Saturday morning

GILES
Dude Jail

Jason plops down on a couch continues a video game he had on
pause He spends more time here than at home and it shows

JASON
Yeah I may have underestimated the
school’s reaction to that one

GILES
You think Last day of school or
not you hit an entire wall

JASON
I wanted a big finish

GILES
So that was really it your
retirement from the art world
What about New York with Maggie

JASON
Not unless you’re gonna loan me
three hundred dollars

GILES
She’s gonna loan you a break-up
That girl planned everything got
you a portfolio review

JASON

Which is an extra hundred bucks
Her and my mom they can’t wait for
me to be a starving artist

(videogame gets intense)
And Danny wants me to be a mindless
worker drone at a furniture supply
company

GILES
Well what do you want

Jason finishes a level puts down the controller
JASON
I don’t think that matters right

now I’m not exactly in control

GILES
I however am in complete control
Giles holds up his hands like a conductor and two RC
HELICOPTERS on his workbench suddenly come to life

GILES (CONTD)
I hooked up the Kinect sensors to
my helicopters

With a gesture he sends them criss-crossing around the room

GILES (CONTD)
I’m like Magneto but with very
small objects

Jason sees more than that He sees a way to be practical

JASON
Giles are you a people person

GILES
People fucking love me

JASON
I think I got something In my
brain Right now

GILES
Ring-worm

JASON
Best Buy just shut down right

GILES
Outdated business model

JASON
And the Apple Store makes you wait
like three hours just to hit your
restart button So Loserville’s
got demand for tech knowledge but
limited supply And you’re sitting
here at MIT West

Giles lands the helicopters with a graceful touch
GILES
I admit to having marketable

skills How does this involve you

JASON
Every Wozniak needs a Jobs

Giles raises an eyebrow
INTEXT VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS of Giles on a skateboard Jason on his bike
putting up fliers

- on trees in the subdivision
- at Safeway Whole Foods the local pizza joint
- on a notice board near an Apple Store TIGHT ON that one

CHEAP TECH HELP

INT KITCHEN - JASON’S HOUSE - DUSK
Jason and Giles enter as Etta futzes with mac ‘n’ cheese

GILES
Hi Ms Halter

ETTA
Hey Giles You staying for dinner
I got hot dogs

Danny barrels in grabs a beer from the fridge

DANNY
Ma don’t feed this nerd

GILES
(giving Danny a hug)
Hey welcome back man I am truly
happy you’re in one piece

DANNY
Ah it wasn’t so bad Thought I
told you to look out for my little
brother while I was gone You
couldn’t keep him out of jail

GILES
I’ve got my hands full with people
copying off my tests

ETTA
Don’t let ‘em do that sweetie

DANNY
Unless they’re really hot So
what’re you deadbeats up to this
summer Flippin’ burgers

Jason and Giles look at each other about to explain their
new business venture when Giles’ CELL RINGS First customer

JASON
Getting my priorities straight

He leaves a flier behind swipes a hot dog for the road As
the boys exit Danny assesses the flier with a furrowed brow

INT MR SANDERS’ LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Giles sits in front of a computer flanked by Jason and MR
SANDERS unnatural dye job discount necktie

MR SANDERS
I have no idea what could be wrong

GILES
Mr Sanders could you um go
check to see how many phone jacks
are in your bedroom

MR SANDERS
How will that help

GILES
It has to do with the capacity of
the house’s wiring to receive a
significant amount of data

MR SANDERS
(exiting)
Got it I’mon it

JASON
What kind of bullshit was that

GILES
This kind

A click reveals a browsing history of granny-trannies and
amateur interracial lesbian nurses

JASON
Holy hand lotion

GILES
Mr Sanders is a porn addict

JASON
So can you fix it

GILES
Porn addiction No The computer--
(a few more clicks)
-- has been cleansed of impurities

JASON
Don’t say what was wrong We’1ll1
have our first repeat customer

Mr Sanders returns

MR SANDERS
Will two jacks be enough

JASON
Probably not for you

EXT MR SANDERS’ HOUSE - EVENING

As they walk and grin Jason divides the 50 fee With one
look back at Sanders’ house they bust out LAUGHING

GILES
How’s it feel to be a tech pimp

JASON
Why didn’t we ever do this before

The boys fail to notice the APPROACHING CLOUD PATTERN in the
sky behind them charged with electricity and menace

INT LIVING ROOM - JASON’S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Jason enters finds Danny bathed in the glow of Jon Stewart
The cable gets fuzzy Danny WHACKS the cable box

DANNY
Goddammit I can finally watch TV
and the town goes Third World

JASON
Giles can fix it tomorrow

DANNY
That doesn’t help me now
(off Jason slinking away)
Hey This tech thing You better
not rip anybody off

JASON
(sotto heading upstairs)
Great to have you back

INT JASON’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Decorated with Jason’s own art - surreal collages all with a
sense of humor - and some by Banksy JR et al

Jason collapses on the bed Considers the design school
application his mother left on his night stand

Doesn’t fill it out puts on headphones grabs a sketch pad
But the blank page intimidates Artist block Life block

Bleary-eyed Jason looks out the window Clouds approach
Inspiration strikes He sketches in ink

A figure takes shape Danny in full military uniform with
his head exploding out into beautiful fireworks

As he continues to draw a SUDDEN DOWNPOUR hits the house
The strange viscous raindrops bead on the window panes

EXT SUBDIVISION - CONTINUOUS

The rain spreads quickly throughout the entire subdivision
HARD PATTER on the asphalt Seeping in everywhere The
liquid almost seems to have a mind of its own

Streetlights and houselights flicker A car alarm goes off

Finally the rain FILLS OUR VIEW and ALL GOES BLACK

INT JASON’S ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Jason sleeps headphones still on He wakes to his phone
ringing 12 missed calls All Giles

Jason reconsiders his late-night sketch tears it up and
tosses it in the trash as he answers the phone

JASON
Mmm-hmmHuhHow many

SMASH TO

AN AERIAL SHOT OF THE SUBDIVISION ZOOM DOWN INTO A HOUSE

GILES

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - AFTERNOON

Giles skateboards on the wet asphalt beside Jasons bike
Theyre beat Jason’s phone RINGS shows a pic of MAGGIE

GILES
What the hell happened last night

JASON
Relax It’s just Maggie

Jason hesitates taking the call

GILES
When in doubt avoid

JASON
Between her and Danny I’m ready to
go off the grid
(doesn’t take the call)
Let’s do one more job

They turn and look down BOAR’S CREEK ROAD The old blacktop
extends past the edge of the subdivision crossing the
highway No one takes this road unless they have to

It looks even more imposing with the lingering clouds

GILES
Out there Really

JASON
Cmon

Giles is tired but concedes and the boys head to --

EXT TED’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

A three-story ramshackle holdover from the 1940s totally out
of place in the characterless subdivisions of 2013

As the boys approach the porch a screen door kicks open and
out hobbles TED MCKENDRICK Prematurely bald paunch
scowl Crutches with ARM BRACES help him walk

TED
You little fuck-rats cops

JASON
Do we look like cops

TED
That’s what you say when you can’t
say “I’m not a cop”

JASON
I’m not a cop

TED
You askin’ or tellin’ me

GILES
We are not cops

TED
You the smart one

GILES
Unquestionably

TED
Well get the fuck in here

INT FAMILY ROOM - TED’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

It looks like a family of pack rats died here and Ted hasn’t
made time to clear out all their shit

JASON
I used to be scared to come here on
Halloween

TED
That Ex-Lax thing was never proven

GILES
I think he was more referring to
the Texas Chainsaw decor

TED
You wanna hear what I need or not

The boys shrug nod enthusiastically Ted turns to his TV

TED (CONTD)
Alright then My DirecTV dish got
knocked out last night

JASON
It was the storm nothing to worry
about Whole town has electronics
trouble

Ted scoops up a box of Crackerjack snacks away

TED
If you wanna believe that Now I’d
climb out and fix it myself but --
(referring to his braces)
my talents lie in other arenas

JASON
Right

TED
Don’t be a prick
(offers some of his snack)
Crackerjack

Jason sheepishly refuses Giles helps himself

GILES
Not to talk our way out of money
but the good people at DirecTV will
fix that for free

TED
Yeah but they don’t give away 500
channels through an illegal
receiver box for free

The guys get it Giles begins inspecting Ted’s setup

GILES
Wideopen 3M script running on both
the P4 and P5 streams

TED
What is this 2007

Ted reveals his RECEIVER Homemade but wow Giles knows
he’s in the presence of a next-level techie

TED (CONTD)
So you gonna help me or what

Giles and Jason look at each other Time to work

EXT TED’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

The SATELLITE DISH looms impossibly high three stories up
from where Jason and Giles stand staring It nearly
disappears into the low hanging clouds

JASON
(off Giles’ fear)
Hey I’d go but I’d have absolutely
no idea what to do up there

GILES
Id be happy to tell you everything
I know about satellite positioning
in the next five minutes

JASON
You need me to get a harness and
maybe I dunno Vagisil Is that
your preferred brand
Ted yells from the porch

TED
You guys bill by the hour

Giles begins the ascent up a rickety extension ladder

GILES
(back over his shoulder)
I can’t believe I succumbed to your
misogynistic goading

Jason puts his foot on the ladder to hold it in place
Behind him a CAR BRAKES TO A STOP and a CAR DOOR SLAMS

FEMALE VOICE (0S)
Jay

Uh-oh He’s finally busted

FEMALE VOICE (CONTD)
Goddammit Jay

Jason looks down Ted’s driveway sees Maggie marching at him

TED
(grinning to Jason)
Pissed off girlfriend
(off Jasons nod)
Awesome

Jason looks up sees Giles at the top of the ladder half
tinkering with the dish half watching the show

GILES
Do not let go of the ladder dude

Maggie approaches exasperated but a little heart-broken

MAGGIE
I gotta track you down

JASON
I’m sorry

MAGGIE
That’s one word for it You get
arrested then you duck my calls
I’m your girlfriend not homework
you forgot to turn in

JASON
I know I know

He backs off from Maggie And the ladder

JASON (CONTD)
Danny came home I got caught up in
this whole geek squad thing and --
(finally says it)
(MORE )

JASON (CONTD)
I’m not showing my portfolio I’m
not applying to art school

A beat as Maggie takes it in

MAGGIE
Well then let’s get you in for a
business school interview
(defeated)
I think I might be done

Ted is completely engrossed on the porch scarfs Crackerjack

TED
(sotto mouthful)
Who needs TV

No one notices THE LADDER START TO SLIDE

JASON
Maggie c’mon it’s just not
practical right now It’s not that
big a deal

MAGGIE
That’s why I’m done Because you
don’t think it’s a big deal
You’re an artist You need to go
make art

JASON
And put my mom into more debt For
a pipe dream

MAGGIE
Oh it’s a pipe dream Look I was
gonna wait till New York but I
guess I’1l tell you now I’m not
going back to Turner in the Fall

Even Ted didn’t see that coming
MAGGIE (CONTD)
NYU offered to let me come a year

early I’m taking my GED

JASON
Maggie let’s --

A LOUD CRASH interrupts as the LADDER FALLS

GILES
HELP

They look up to see Giles DANGLING from the rain gutter
beneath the satellite dish The fall could kill him

JASON
Oh shit

Jason hefts the ladder back into place Begins to climb
Ted hobbles off the porch Maggie holds the ladder steady
Above Giles hangs begging to live

GILES
Hurry up This is not good

The wood holding the gutter starts to CREAK and CRACK

JASON
Just hang on I’m coming

Jason scrambles up Maggie fights to keep the ladder stable
Just then the RAIN starts up again SPLATTERING HARD

Jason hops onto the roof almost slips as he steps to the
edge He lays out the plan to reassure them both

JASON (CONTD)
Ill get on my belly You grab my
arms and I’1l pull you up OK

GILES
Do it

Giles barely hangs on as Jason lies down reaches out
Giles hand slips The gutter is coming off
But Jason grabs Giles’ free hand pulls him back to the roof

Ted and Maggie are eager for a status update Maggie steps
away from the ladder to look up at them

JASON
He’s OK

Maggie is relieved

GILES
I fixed the satellite

Ted is relieved

TED
You guys rock

Before Maggie can go back to hold the ladder steady Jason
turns to descend and --
-- THE LADDER SLIDES ON THE WET GROUND AND FALLS BACKWARDS

MAGGIE
Jason

Time slows as Jason back-flips weightlessly through the rain
into what might be his last moment on Earth

A blast of panic and a kaleidoscope of vertigo as he falls
from fifty feet up

FADE TO GREY

INT HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Jason emerges abruptly from a deep sleep His face and arms
are scratched badly bandaged

HIS POV The room comes into ultra-sharp focus Bright
sunlight Window Bed Danny in a chair

DANNY
Morning sunshine

JASON
Huh

DANNY

Did you get dumber
Jason tries to sit up immediately winces in pain

JASON
What the hell happened

DANNY
Apparently I went to war to protect
your ass and you proceeded to
throw it off a roof

JASON
Did I break anything

DANNY
About a dozen tree branches You
landed in that crazy guy’s trash

JASON
Home computer repair is some
dangerous shit

(MORE )

JASON (CONTD)
(looks around)
Where is everyone

DANNY
I sent Mom home to get some rest
Giles was last seen with the
moderately hot night nurse

JASON
He likes the uniforms Maggie

Danny shakes his head Jason tries to shrug it off winces

JASON (CONT’D)
They better give me good drugs

DANNY
You’11 need ‘em to deal with Mom

INT JASON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Etta gives Jason a tight hug She just got one son out of
danger this must have been hard

Jason eyes the feast on the table A huge pan of lasagna
Garlic bread Salad Enough to feed three families

ETTA
(I was really worried)
I cooked
JASON

It looks great Mom Thanks
The family enjoys the meal in silence for a beat too long

ETTA
How’s your head feeling

JASON
It’s actually not too bad

ETTA
Do you feel nauseous

JASON
Just when I watch him eat

Danny scarfs lasagna shovels BRUSSEL SPROUTS into his mouth

JASON (CONTD)
Brussel sprouts

DANNY
They’re really good for you
(off Jason’s “huh”)
It’s called growing up

He steals a glance at the cell phone in his lap NO MESSAGES
No Maggie no more customers

JASON
Would you guys kill me if I went to
lie down

ETTA
Go ahead sweetie Lasagna’s even
better the next day

JASON
You always say that
(one last bite)

This is actually really good You
should use this sauce every time

ETTA
(smiles confused)
It’s the same stuff I always use
DANNY
They say your taste buds can change
when you hit your head

With a shrug Jason heads upstairs Etta and Danny trade a
look of mild concern

INT JASON’S ROOM - LATER

Jason lies on his bed but sleep won’t come He keeps
looking at his phone Finally dials Maggie Listens

A familiar CLICK of a connection but as he’s about to speak--
A SCRAMBLED VOICE like a skipping record playing backwards

He frowns at the weirdness hangs up looks out at the sky
Clouds are gone stars shine brightly

He tries again The phone RINGS but Maggie doesn’t pick up

Jason looks at the clock makes a quick decision He climbs
over the bed and OUT THE WINDOW

EXT SUBDIVISION - NIGHT

Jason walks several houses over The night is quiet calm
Not much traffic past eleven around here

EXT MAGGIE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Not surprisingly her house looks just like Jason’s But the
garage door is OPEN with no car inside

He sees the light on in Maggie’s second-floor room

He walks in through the garage hesitates before just barging
into the house Knocks

JASON
Maggie

Silence He gently turns the knob and the door opens

INT MAGGIE’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Empty Clean Dark
JASON
(softly)
Mags

He heads upstairs tiptoes past her parents’ room No one’s
inside just the TV glowing playing TCM with no sound

Jason steps into Maggie’s room no one there either The
room’s all teen angst a wall of books obscure band
stickers and a Gene Simmons version of Hello Kitty
CREAK Jason stiffens Someone is coming up the stairs
Maggie Her Dad with his baseball bat
FOOTSTEPS GET CLOSER Jason tenses even more
But the sound stops abruptly Huh
Jason checks the hall No one
He walks to the stairs The TV in the parents’ room is OFF
JASON (CONTD)
(risks it)
Maggie
No response At what point does he get scared

SUDDENLY A BRIGHT RED LIGHT shines through the window LIGHTS
UP THE ROOM like a police searchlight A LOUD ENGINE WHINES

As Jason hurries down the stairs toward the front door the
light veers off and the engine sound fades Where did it go
Motion in the corner of his eye Jason turns --

There’s Maggie Asleep on the living room couch

breathes relief

JASON (CONT’D)
Mags

She stirs groggy

JASON (CONTD)
Hey Where are your parents

MAGGIE
Vegas What are you doing here

JASON
Is anyone else in the house I
think I saw a police helicopter

MAGGIE
No one’s here Police helicopter

Maggie finally gets her bearings

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
Should you be out of the hospital

JASON
I’m fine You’d know that if you
came to see how I was

MAGGIE
I called Giles
(off his puppy dog eyes)
Hey I’m still upset Bumps on the
head get you no special treatment

JASON
Give me parameters I’1l work for
it What’1ll it take severed
finger Meningitis

She pushes his face away gets off the couch

MAGGIE
Did Giles tell you what happened
(off Jason’s shaking head)
When you fell I fainted He
called 911 for both of us We rode
in the same ambulance

JASON
Aww that’s sweet

Jason

He puts his arms around her She lets him

MAGGIE
We’re not back together
(back to the problem)
I know I was pushing you into the
trip but I’m not letting you quit

JASON
I’m not quitting I just -- since
my dad left -- it’s a money thing

Maggie holds his look “Really” Jason holds his ground
MAGGIE
OK Ill back off But you’re
coming in August to help me move
And youre bringing your portfolio

JASON
I‘ll do it I promise

He looks to see if she’s happy but she’s hard to read

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - NIGHT
Jason makes his way back home in better spirits

But the walk home seems to be taking longer Did he already
pass this house No way to tell they all look the same

No he’s definitely disoriented Jason stops to get his
bearings on a walk he’s made a thousand times

He rubs his head feeling for his injury
His cell phone RINGS breaks the silence No caller ID

Jason answers The EERIE SCRAMBLED VOICE again It turns
HIGH-PITCHED and he pulls the phone away from his ear

POP A streetlight suddenly blows out Nearly gives him a
heart attack He recovers laughs Just a power outage

Jason turns around and gets BLINDED by the SAME RED LIGHT
that was at Maggie’s house ENGINE NOISE is twice as loud

He looks at the sky and sees SOMETHING FLYING OVER HIM in the
distance All he can make out is a BRIGHT RED LIGHT

THE LIGHT starts to DESCEND Jason runs makes the corner
onto his own street when --

MRS WALTERS
AHHH

Jason runs into MRS WALTERS nearly as wide as she is tall
She was not there just a second ago

MRS WALTERS (CONTD)
Jason Halter You scared the
bejeezus out of me

The engine sound and the red light are GONE

JASON
(freaked babbling)
Mrs Walters I didn’t even see
you At all Did you see that
light In the sky

MRS WALTERS
You’re standing on Joby’s leash

He steps back and her cocker spaniel breathes again

JASON
Sorry But did you see the light

MRS WALTERS
Are you feeling alright Jason Do
you need me to call your mother

JASON
No ma’am

He suddenly feels NAUSEOUS knees weak Mrs Walters looks
at him sternly as he quickly heads home

As he walks away he looks back to see Mrs Walters her
expression gone cold staring up at the sky

EXT GRADY HOUSE - NEXT DAY
Giles adjusts a camera on a client’s home security system

JASON
That thing was following me I
swear Is that what a spy drone
looks like It was loud No way
Mrs Walters didn’t hear it And
she came out of nowhere How can a
woman that size sneak up on anyone

Giles power-drills a couple of screws pauses thoughtfully

GILES
I agree that Mrs Walters is not
thin

(MORE)

GILES (CONTD)
I have no idea what the rest of
that stuff means Here be useful
Take this over there

He hands Jason a camera and a WALKIE TALKIE heads the other
way Jason refuses to let it go calls Giles on the walkie

INTERCUT - ACROSS THE YARD Giles talks on his walkie as he
places another camera

JASON
You’re not curious about this

GILES
I’m curious about your head injury

JASON
Look I’m hearing weird shit on my
cell phone the whole neighborhood
has tech problems and I’m seeing
lights in the sky Something weird
is happening and I want to figure
out what it is

GILES

OK fine The cell phone Service
here sucks and you have a crappy
phone Neighborhood tech problems
Electrical storms Lights in the
sky We’re an hour from a military
base it could be anything But
probably not a spy drone you’re
just not that interesting So what
do you think it is

(incredulous)
A spaceship

Jason wont admit it but that’s exactly what he thought
GILES (CONT’D)
Dude Get real Nothing weird

ever happens here

The walkie talkie signal grows garbled Both boys hold
perfectly still as they HEAR THAT SCRAMBLED BACKWARDS VOICE

The sound goes HIGH-PITCHED and the boys drop their walkies
As they hit the ground the walkies SPARK and SHORT OUT

Jason runs to Giles who’s studying the remains of his walkie

JASON
And what was that

GILES
Pretty goddamn weird

JASON
You gonna help me figure this out

Giles tries to plug in a rational explanation Fails

GILES
Looks like we have a signal to
track

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - DAY

Jason and Giles PHONES in hand split up and cover the
subdivision Jason on his bike Giles on a skateboard

JASON rolls till the scrambled signal returns

JASON
You hear it

GILES (PHONE)
I’m marking it

GILES skates in a cul-de-sac marks a point on his iPad

GILES (CONT’D)
Got another

They blanket the neighborhood Giles drops pins on GOOGLE
MAPS every place they hear the transmission fade in and out

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - LATER
The boys reunite Jason stops his bike as Giles skates up

JASON
And

Giles rotates the iPad shows him the map The pins arranged
in a very obvious pattern an X across the subdivision

GILES
That is not random

JASON
What’s in the center Is there a
new cell phone tower

GILES
Trust me everything is exactly the
same as it was a couple days ago

Off Jason’s concern --

EXT MAGGIE’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

Jason and Giles have interrupted Maggie washing her car in
the driveway to show her the iPad map She’s not buying it

MAGGIE
This is how you get your head
together

JASON
This has nothing to do with that
(points to the X pattern)
Something’s going on

MAGGIE
Like what

JASON
We think it might be some kind of
spy drone or maybe even --
(won’t say alien)
Who the hell knows Our damn
walkie talkies exploded

MAGGIE

So what’s next Call all the spy
drone companies NASA Or I know
Maybe you could go back to the
hospital and get your concussion
checked out again

(to Giles)
And maybe you open a window next
time you paint those figurines

GILES
Statuettes

MAGGIE
Whatever SyFy Channel

Jason is frustrated Maggie’s not normally this dismissive

MAGGIE (CONTD)
Look Wiggins is having a party
tonight Laura wanted to have it
at my house since my parents are
gone but I convinced her Wiggins
should do it because he has a pool

Jason is only half-listening still focused on the mystery

GILES
I like pool parties Wiggins not
so much but I’1l fake it I’m in

MAGGIE
So we’ll go be regular teenagers
getting into trouble No more
freak occurrences

She tries to lighten the moment menaces Jason with the hose
Jason snaps out of it tries to act normal

As Jason and Giles walk away
JASON
Were not giving up
INTEXT JASON’S HOUSE - THAT EVENING
Jason comes downstairs heading out to the party notices --

DANNY standing in the back yard staring up at the sky Like
Mrs Walters was

JASON
What are you doing

Danny looks at him calmly Something is off

DANNY
Where you going

JASON
There’s a party at Wiggins’

Danny goes back to scanning the sky The moon looms large

JASON (CONTD)
Um I know I’m the one who hit my
head But maybe you should go to
bed early tonight

DANNY
(sudden snap)
What the hell does that mean

JASON
Nothing I’ve just never seen
youstar-gazing or whatever

DANNY
People can be unpredictable

JASON
Yes they can

He heads out leaves Danny looking at the stars

EXT WIGGINS’ HOUSE - NIGHT
Pool party in full swing Bass-heavy music Booze flowing

Jason Giles and Maggie arrive Jason is distracted clearly
doesn’t want to be there

They make their way through the crowd to WIGGINS mathlete enjoying his night of popularity

Giles approaches and they give each other the nerdiest bro-
hug in the history of the suburbs

GILES
You seem to be in your cups good
sir Might we partake

WIGGINS
May my meager selection of spirits
bring you satisfaction

He pulls three bottles out of a cooler

JASON
Every time it’s like an instant
Renaissance Faire with you guys

GILES
Comfort zone Fools the best

MAGGIE
Thank you Wiggins

WIGGINS
(off the high number of
hotties present)
No thank you m’lady for
suggesting that I host this
(to the crowd)
Party of the year people

The crowds too drunk to disagree Jason takes a pull off a
beer but he can’t relax Keeps looking up at the sky

EXT WIGGINS’ HOUSE - LATER

Now it’s a party People swimming BBQ glowing Lounge
chairs occupied by couples Is that weed I smell

Giles is telling the porn addict story to a small crowd

GILES
So in his web history is every porn
site known to man Or beast And
I’m not saying who it wasbecause
his daughter is here at this party

Everyone cracks up

ACROSS THE YARD -- Maggie and Jason are buzzed and making up
Looks like Jason has finally stopped obsessing for a minute
JASON
Hey Thanks for the second chance
MAGGIE
Humility I like this Swim
JASON
Nah
MAGGIE

You don’t want me to strip down to
a bikini and dive into that pool

JASON
Maybe Yes Yes I do

She locks eyes with Jason as she takes off her t-shirt and
shorts It’s like they’re the only people here

She breaks the spell dives in Jason follows smiling He
jumps in sinks to the bottom

JASONS POV Bubbles legs kicking dark sky above

He comes up for air finds Maggie smiling slicking back her
long hair blinking away the chlorine

Jason glides towards her Going after what he wants not
running from it Maggie plants a kiss on him A good one

MAGGIE
I don’t want to hear anything else
about cell phones OK

JASON
OK

Jason scans the party as he treads water
Cooking burgers Smiling teens

Maggie splashes him playfully but Jason suddenly stiffens

Near the house is the RED LIGHT moving quickly around a
corner Like the one he saw coming home from Maggie’s

Jason swims towards it but it’s gone

MAGGIE
What’s wrong

JASON
(deciding not to say)
Nothing I’m a little --

Maggie swims to him pushes him to the side and kisses him
again like she’s trying to keep his focus

HE SEES SOMETHING SWIMMING IN THE WATER
Just a glimpse but it looked like a large silver-grey snake

JASON (CONT’D)
Jesus

MAGGIE
What What

JASON
I saw something in the water

MAGGIE
What are you talking about

He sees it again swimming between Maggie’s kicking legs
JASON
(shouting grabbing her)
GET OUT GET OUT OF THE WATER

Maggie lets him push her out of the pool onto the concrete

Everyone else freaks swims for the sides In a minute the
pool is empty Everyone stares at Jason

JASON (CONTD)
It’s there look
(to Maggie)
I told you
Wiggins takes a look at the bottom of his pool DIVES IN

JASON (CONT’D)
No don’t

Wiggins takes way too long Not good

He finally comes up clutching a BEER BONG

RANDOM KID
Dude you totally saved us

Everyone laughs Except Jason who’s still scared and Maggie
who’s very embarrassed Giles steps in

GILES
Time to go home
(to the crowd)
And let this be a lesson to all of
you delinquents Just say no

Jason turns to Maggie She’s over it

JASON
I saw something And I saw that
light again It was here

GILES
Yup time to go

He guides Jason into a towel Jason reels for a second
Nauseous again

MAGGIE
Sleep it off Jay

He wants to argue but knows she won’t listen He walks away
with Giles But as they approach the house Jason looks up
at the sky again --

JASON
I’m gonna try to see where that
light went

GILES
Jay don’t --

But Jason’s getting desperate for answers He breaks away
from Giles and runs into Wiggins’ house

INT WIGGINS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

He heads upstairs The house is identical to Maggie’s so
Jason feels a little deja vu as he goes from room to room
looking out the windows for any sign of the Red Light

Nothing MUSIC drifts down the hall from Wiggins’ room the
last room to check He gets to the door knocks impatiently

JASON
Hey um I left a bag in there
Whoever’s macking on whoever
Whatever Coming in

He enters and sure enough a couple makes out on the bed
Jason surveys the room all clear --

THE BEDROOM IS SUDDENLY LIT UP WITH RED LIGHT FROM OUTSIDE
THE COUPLE doesn’t react but when Jason looks at them --

THEIR FACES ARE JOINED TOGETHER the flesh stretching like
melting plastic as they try to pull apart

Jason blinks his eyes looks again -- just a guy and a girl
The light at the window is gone the room is dark

GUY
Bro Go away Kinda busy

INT WIGGINS’ HOUSE - SECONDS LATER
Jason hurries downstairs Giles sees how pale he looks

JASON
Home Now

EXT SUBDIVISION - NIGHT
The boys walk Jason is still babbling --

JASON
I know what I saw This isn’t some
spy drone Spy drones don’t make
people’s faces melt

GILES
Should I be worried

JASON
About me or about what I’m seeing
Cmon don’t tell me you don’t
believe me Not like Maggie

GILES
I believe you But all I’ve seen
is a scrambled phone signal

JASON
It’s not just the goddamn cell
phones Aren’t you listening I’m
being followed by a UFO

Giles stops His buddy just crossed the crazy line

JASON (CONTD)
Don’t look at me like that

Jason walks on

INT GILES’ BASEMENT - NIGHT

Back in his safe house Jason’s wheels start to turn He
SKETCHES The thing in the pool The melting face-kissers

GILES
These are really disturbing

JASON
Has anyone else been seeing any of
this stuff Can we do a search

Giles starts web-surfing

GILES
What am I Googling “Melting
people” or “phantom helicopters”
I think those bands are actually
playing together

JASON
Just pull up the map again
There’s gotta be something

CLOSE on Giles’ iPad Jason points to houses each on the X

JASON (CONT’D)

Check out where all this happened
There’s Maggie’s where I saw it
the first time

(another pin)
And there’s where I was when I was
walking home --

(and another)
And there’s Wiggins’ place

GILES
So what does it mean

JASON
It means we know where to look
(off Giles’ hesitation)
Cmon help me out If we can
catch it on video it wouldn’t seem
so crazy right

Giles assesses Jason Should he enable him any further

Sure why not He pulls up a video window on his desktop a
living room to another house on the X

The camera looks across the room out a picture window A
great view of the skyline over the subdivision

JASON (CONTD)
Is that the Yuns’ place

GILES
Yup It’s their nanny-cam

JASON
You can remote-access the cameras
we installed

GILES
Yes I can

JASON
That’s not legal

GILES
I’m just running a system check for
a client But if it happens to
record any bizarre phenomena --

JASON
So you believe me

GILES
I believe there might be a flying
object to identify

Jason takes the victory

JASON
How many web-cams can we access
GILES
Maybe eight Plus security cameras
at the Salishes’ But most of

those won’t have a view of the sky

JASON
Could we add cameras

GILES
Sure we could put a few wireless
ones outside Tie them into the
networks We could see everything

JASON
Time to do some follow-up calls

SMASH TO
AERIAL SHOT OF THE SUBDIVISION ZOOM DOWN INTO EACH HOUSE

Jason and Giles are at a door

JASON (CONTD)
Hi we’re doing a follow-up check
of our work free of charge
ZOOM OUT ACROSS THE SUBDIVISION TO ANOTHER HOUSE

MR SALISH close-shaven beard hovers over Jason at the
keyboard doesn’t notice --

Giles out the window adding a new camera at a skyward angle

MR SALISH
Everything’s working perfectly

JASON
Great This’ll only take a moment

ZOOM OUT TO ANOTHER HOUSE

Jason is with MR SANDERS He winces as he spots a box of
tissues conveniently next to the computer

JASON (CONTD)
Diagnostic check’s almost done

Spots Giles outside giving a thumbs up

JASON (CONT’D)
All good

ZOOM OUT AND DOWN TO ONE LAST HOUSE
His house Jason adjusts a camera Aims it at the sky

ZOOM OUT AND BACK TO --

INT GILES’ BASEMENT - NIGHT

Jason and Giles stand in front of six monitors each with
four camera views The skyline over the X is covered

GILES
Now what

JASON
Wait for it

VARIOUS SHOTS
The thrill of the hunt gives way to --
Munchies and Monster drinks which evolves to --

Feverish CALL OF DUTY gameplay then --

Giles asleep Jason bleary-eyed fighting through the pain --

On auto-pilot he sketches the lights in the sky but stops
when his NAUSEA returns He stands to steady himself --

But then he notices something on the monitors --

JASON (CONTD)
Dude wake up

GILES
Huh
Giles snaps awake
JASON
There
GILES

In the sky I don’t see anything

JASON
Mr Salish does

Mr Salish stands in his yard staring at the night sky

JASON (CONTD)
That’s exactly what Danny was doing
last night before the party And
Mrs Walters You wanna tell me
what the hell they’re doing

The boys watch Mr Salish stand completely inhumanly still
for what must be minutes

JASON (CONTD)
Mass hypnosis

(Giles shakes his head)
Environmental contamination causing
hallucinations

(Giles shakes his head)

Alien mind control

Giles meets Jason’s eyes He might finally believe Tension
hangs in the air

BANG They nearly jump out of their skin as someone BANGS ON
THE BULKHEAD DOORS to Giles’ basement

They turn to find Maggie stepping down into nerd world

MAGGIE
You need windows in here it smells
like boys

(MORE)

MAGGIE (CONTD)
(notes their tension)
You guys all right

JASON
You gotta see something

He directs her to the video array

MAGGIE
Is this the entire subdivision

JASON
Just a few houses Check this out

He points to Mr Salish standing in the corner

MAGGIE
What am I looking at

JASON
You don’t find that strange

MAGGIE
A guy standing in his backyard

JASON
Look it’s not just Mr Salish
Danny’s been doing the same thing
and this house is on that X pattern
where we got those cell signals
and where I’m saw the lights and
I’m worried because your house is
on that X too

Maggie stares at her boyfriend for a beat

MAGGIE
Is that all Can I tell you how
crazy you sound now What do you
think this is

JASON
If we knew that we wouldn’t be
doing all this

Jason looks at her earnestly but Maggie coldly surveys the
video array the empty food boxes and cans

She sees Jason’s obsessive sketches

MAGGIE
I think you need to go back to the
hospital or you’re gonna end up
back in jail This is illegal

GILES
Not technically

JASON
Only if we get caught

MAGGIE
(shaking her head)
So disappointing
(to Giles)
And you need to stop encouraging
this crap Ugh unbelievable

She storms out of the basement

EXT GILES’ HOUSE - DAY
Jason is blinded by the daylight When did the sun come up

JASON
Maggie

She’s not stopping He has to grab her arm

JASON (CONTD)
Maggie

MAGGIE
Let go

JASON
Not until you tell me what’s wrong

MAGGIE
What’s wrong is you can’t see
what’s wrong You won’t get your
portfolio together but you spend
all night spying on people and
chasing lights

Jason looks at her like he’s having trouble recognizing her

JASON
Why don’t you believe me

MAGGIE
Because you’re risking your whole
future over nothing

She walks off Jason can only watch her go

Giles leans out of the basement doors

GILES
You gotta see this

INT GILES’ BASEMENT - DAY
Jason is still tense from Maggie until he sees

Five screens with more neighbors looking at the sky Two at
windows in their houses Three more in their backyards

GILES
What do you think

JASON
It’s spreading This is big

GILES
Let’s get a closer look at Salish

He and Giles EXIT quickly HOLD ON THE MONITORS

One figure suddenly turns from the sky looks right into a
camera It’s DANNY

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - DAY

Jason and Giles peer around a corner They can see Mr
Salish still standing in his yard eyes to the sky

JASON
Cmon

They move closer quietly so they don’t spook the guy

But as the boys reach the fence Salish snaps out of it
Heads back in the house

GILES
Whoa

JASON
No shit

TIRES SCREECH behind them startling them

DANNY
Hey dorks

They turn to find Danny in his fixed up JEEP

DANNY (CONT’D)
You didn’t come home last night
Mom called the hospitals when
neither one of you losers picked
up I’m taking you home
(off their hesitation)
Get in

GILES
(quiet to Jason)
Ask him about it

Not about to antagonize his brother Jason heads to the Jeep

GILES (CONTD)
Such a bad idea

But Giles climbs in behind Jason

INT JEEP —- DAY
Danny drives the boys are quiet

DANNY
You guys been up all night

JASON
Giles just got Black Ops 2

DANNY
War simulation

JASON
Feels like you’re there

DANNY
Does it

They drive on

DANNY (CONT’D)
Why were you at Salish’s place

JASON
No reason

DANNY
Looked like you were spying on him

GILES
We were checking on a customer

DANNY
How’s that going

JASON
We’re making a little money

DANNY
I saw some cameras at our place

Jason notices the speed of the Jeep increasing

JASON
Theyre just web-cams So we know
what works for the customers

GILES
(getting worried)
Everyone’s really into security
these days You know safety

DANNY
That’s probably not the best move
People might get the wrong idea

GILES
We are shutting down those web-cams
as soon as we get home

Danny nearly has the Jeep floored

DANNY
You know that one in eight vets has
PTSD

JASON

What are you talking about Danny
Slow down

Danny answers by red-lining the Jeep

DANNY
What Too fast for you

The Jeep whips through the subdivision takes a corner way
too fast The boys have to hold on tight or get ejected

JASON
Danny

DANNY
One in eight baby So what are
you watching for boys

He guns the Jeep right at the dead end of a cul-de-sac

JASON
Slow the fuck down

DANNY
What are my odds little brother
Let’s roll those dice

The house at the end of the street speeds toward them No
way they can turn without rolling the Jeep

At the last second Danny hits the e-brake The balance of
the Jeep is at the limit SCREECHES on two wheels --

Into a perfect slide stop at the end of the cul-de-sac

Jason and Giles are scared shitless Danny is back to his
normal self the craziness replaced with laughter

DANNY (CONT’D)
Oh Your faces You should see--

JASON
Asshole

Jason and Giles leap out of the Jeep safe on solid ground

DANNY

Hey That’s what it’s like to be
scared That’s how Mom felt last
night when you didn’t come home

(off them walking away)
C’mon don’t be pussies I was just
making a point JJ I’m not gonna
hurt you

Giles looks to Jason

GILES
Who’s controlling his mind
INT JASON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jason has dinner with his mom and Danny No one talks The
brothers keep watch on each other

ETTA
OK What is going on with you two

DANNY
Nothing

ETTA
Gimme a break guys Can we just
have one normal night around here

The boys keep at it Etta is frustrated

INT JASON’S ROOM - NIGHT

Jason watches through his cracked door as Danny goes into his
room across the hall

Jason shuts his door Wedges his desk chair under the knob
just to be safe

He writes a text to Maggie “U up” But he deletes it
Something about their last fight put him off

He pulls out the iPad stares at the map hopes it will tell
him he’s not crazy Something clicks He dials Giles

GILES (PHONE)
Can this wait ‘til morning

JASON

Get your mom’s keys and meet me
around the corner

EXT SIDEWALK - NIGHT

Jason paces Giles rolls up in his mom’s MINIVAN

INT MINIVAN - NIGHT

They roll to a stop near a hill of dirt just outside the
subdivision near some new construction

JASON
This is the furthest point of the
X See

He looks up from the iPad Nothing here

GILES
Dead end

Jason points to the layout of the subdivision

JASON
Here’s where we are right now

GILES
But it’s not on the X

JASON
I don’t think it’s an X

He draws ends on the X - it’s a FIGURE EIGHT

JASON (CONTD)
I think it’s a flight pattern All
the points are the places I saw the
hovering lights or where people
were looking at the sky

GILES
But there’s nothing here

JASON
Maybe not but we should check the
other end Go to the Crater

Giles gives Jason a look like this is a wild goose chase but
he’s been a friend too long

GILES
Sure Why waste stealing my mom’s
sweet ride for the night

He flips a wild U-turn

EXT DIRT ROAD NEAR SUBDIVISION - NIGHT

Small mountains loom in the distance as the van stops Jason
gets out Giles follows Nothing here but trees and dark

GILES
There’s probably gonna be a bunch
of burn-outs worshipping the devil
and giving themselves tattoos

But Jason is walking ahead of him into the trees

EXT THE CRATER - NIGHT

A clearing in the woods with a firepit MOONLIGHT reflects
off empty beer cans and junk food wrappers Graffiti on
rocks hundreds of initials carved into trees

Just a place to get stoned and make out with your girlfriend

GILES
Why do you like this place

JASON
Because my mom doesn’t know where
it is I used to come here right
after my dad left when I couldn’t
deal with being supportive

GILES
Have you heard from him

JASON
Yeah he calls He’s writing I
don’t know a novel A memoir
He’s full of shit he’s just
getting laid

GILES
Well that’s --
(off Jason’s glare)
-- totally unacceptable

JASON
Right answer

Suddenly THE LIGHTS appear in the sky

JASON (CONT’D)
There

Giles looks -- and he sees it too Jason’s not crazy It
seems to be darting through the woods towards them

GILES
What the hell is that

For the first time the shape is clear some kind of GLIDER
Sleek wings about a dozen protrusions forty-foot wingspan

Small black spheres hang from its undercarriage glowing with
menacing red lights Its engine SCREECHES definitely the
same thing Jason heard before

Scared Jason picks up the closest ROCK and THROWS IT He
HITS the glider knocks off one of the black spheres

GILES (CONTD)
Holy shit

Jason runs over picks it up but before he can study it --

A loud ROAR OVERHEAD Whatever the source it’s much bigger
than a glider and it’s DESCENDING down on top of them

For once the boys’ banter and sarcasm abandons them Theyre
kids and theyre scared

GILES (CONT’D)
We should go

JASON
Yeah

They backpedal stumbling for the van

The ROAR GETS LOUDER -- it’s right above them The MOON is
BLOCKED OUT by something HUGE

JASON (CONTD)
Hurry

LIGHT Pulsing blinding engulfing the woods

GILES stares up into the lights completely mesmerized like
Salish and Danny were in their yards Jason runs to him

JASON (CONT’D)
Come on

But Giles won’t move Jason follows his frozen gaze up into
the sky to see --

AN ENORMOUS SHIP hovers above the trees Covered with shiny
TILES VALVES METAL PANELS and LIGHTS

THE GLIDER DOCKS into its underside as EXHAUST pours out

Jason can’t wait hefts Giles in a fireman’s carry runs off
Almost trips a dozen times keeps going going

The SHIP FOLLOWS hovers right above lights tracking them

THERE’S THE MINIVAN

He deposits Giles inside Searches his pockets finds keys

EXT DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

The minivan fishtails down the dirt road As it speeds back
onto the highway the light rises off into the sky behind it

INT MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS

Jason checks his mirrors The SHIP doesn’t follow The
glowing lights recede in the distant sky

Giles finally snaps out of it shocked short of breath
Jason drives in silence

INT MINIVAN - LATER THAT NIGHT
Theyre parked outside a POLICE STATION
Silence How do they begin to talk about it

JASON
You OK
GILES
Uh-huh

JASON
You were staring up at it Like
Danny was Are youstill you

GILES
I think so

Jason studies the black sphere he knocked off the ship
Rolls it over and over in his hands

JASON
(re the sphere)
Alright tech guy What is it

GILES
I’m not touching that thing It’1l
open up like the Hellraiser cube or
an evil Transformer

JASON
Don’t be a pussy

GILES
You’re the pussy You know what
you saw you still can’t say it

JASON
If I say it I can’t unsay it
Then either it’s true and we’re
fucked or I’m crazy

GILES
If we’re gonna tell people about
it you gotta say it

JASON
Alright
(deep breath)
I saw an alien spacecraft

GILES
(beat)
Youre right it sounds ridiculous

JASON
Well what the hell are we gonna do
I mean if it’s even real

They both consider the Police Station

GILES
Look well either get option A - a
kindly old guy who takes a chance
on a crazy story or option B-a
smart-alecky jack-ass who wont
heed our warning

JASON

(nods resolved)
Can’t hurt Might help

INT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The boys enter Jason spots the only cop in sight and of
course it just had to be Officer Camp

OFFICER CAMP
Can I help you

Jason hesitates as Camp recognizes him

OFFICER CAMP (CONTD)
What do you want Halter

JASON
I need to report aa UFO

Officer Camp moves a toothpick back and forth in his mouth
OFFICER CAMP

So should I call the National Guard
--what do you think

EXT POLICE STATION - NIGHT
Jason marches for the car Giles is right behind him

GILES
Option B all the way

JASON
He’s a dick

GILES
No one is gonna believe a word

Jason thinks for a beat Holds up the black sphere

JASON
Someone might

EXT TED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

Jason and Giles stand on the porch next to a dysfunctional
bug zapper Maybe this isn’t the right call

There’s a TV on in the living room Ted’s awake They look
at each other Jason shrugs Knocks

The TV turns off

TED (0OS)
Who the hell’s out there It’s
after midnight and all the gun
laws work in my favor

JASON

Ted it’s Jason and Giles
TED

Who
JASON

The guys who fell off your roof

They hear him make his way to the door It opens Ted’s
dishevelled eyes dark-ringed like he hasn’t slept in days

TED
Do I really want to let you in

GILES
If you’re open-minded

JASON
(off Ted’s head-tilt)
That didn’t come out right

TED
Look I’m having a really weird
week I don’t think you guys want
to be a part of it

JASON
Lights in the sky

INT LIVING ROOM - TED’S HOUSE

Ted pours coffee from a french press for the guys Pours a
cup for himself adds a large shot of Ouzo

TED
You first

JASON
After I fell I started seeing
lights in the sky Like a
helicopter was following me but
there was no helicopter

Ted frowns

JASON (CONTD)
And then I saw some kind of creepy-
crawly thing in our friend’s pool
It was slick like an eel but the
size of a boa constrictor --

Ted frowns deeper
GILES
I’m not detecting any surprise or
disbelief

TED
I’m just waiting for you to talk
about something I haven’t seen

It’s Jason and Giles’ turn to frown

JASON
We saw a ship

Beat That’s new

TED
What kind of ship

For a moment Jason can’t say it He holds up a sketch that
he drew on the ride over

JASON
Spaceship

Ted sips his coffee chews on the word studies the image

JASON (CONTD)
So what the hell is happening

TED
Well shit It’s aliens
(shaking his head)
I can’t believe that was your
question

Clearly the boys were hoping he’d have a different theory

TED (CONTD)
The real question is what the hell
do we do

JASON
Wait I’m still trying to figure
out what they’re doing Why us

TED

I’m easy wounded antelope You
two Fuck if I know Maybe that’s
their invasion strategy - take out
all the annoying teenagers

(hitting him)
Fuckin’ Carl Sagan man He sent
out that stupid message like “Come
on over Earth’s awesome” I
always knew that was a bad idea

JASON
We went to the police

TED
(laughs)
Howd that go Oh wait you’re at
my kitchen table Get real guys
No one believes they’re coming if
we don’t get proof

Giles produces a plastic bag holding the BLACK SPHERE

GILES
Jason knocked this off it

TED
Way to bury the lead Gimme that

He takes the sphere turns it over in his hands

GILES
Maybe it’s some sort of anti-
gravity propulsion generator

TED
Maybe it’s a light saber Dumbass
It’s probably just a headlight

Cowed Giles leaves the master to his work

JASON
There’s more We think people are
being affected by it Like they
were responding to a signal or
something You see any of that

TED
UPS guy came by started asking
weird non-UPS-related questions
Like what kind of shampoo I use
how often I eat red meat

GILES
And

TED
I told him to get the hell off my
property before I pounded a shampoo
bottle up his ass So he left

Ted is still stumped by the Black Sphere in his hands

JASON
Any idea what that is

TED
No But give me a day and I will

He hobbles off to get to work Conversation’s over

EXT TED’S HOUSE - DAWN
The boys walk to the MINIVAN
GILES
It’s unsettling when the crazy guy
makes sense

Jason notes the sunrise

JASON
Did we just stay out all night

GILES
Apparently

Jason puts his hands on his temples This is all getting to
be too much They drive off

INT MINIVAN - MORNING

As they approach Giles’ house red and blue lights rotate in
the yard --

GILES
What the --

JASON
Pull over Now

Giles does pulls the van to a stop a ways down the block

Two COP CARS are parked in Giles’ driveway as computers are
taken from his basement and placed in their trunks

But what’s worse Maggie stands with the cops

JASON (CONTD)
They’re busting her

He starts to get out Giles stops him -- Maggie’s chatting
with the cops she’s clearly not under arrest

GILES
Dude I think she’s busting us

Jason can’t believe it

GILES (CONT’D)
Let’s go

JASON
Go where this is your house I’m
gonna find out what she told them

GILES
Don’t be an idiot they’ll arrest
you Again

But Jason is gone

EXT GILES’ HOUSE - MORNING
Jason sneaks along the hedges hides behind garbage cans

When the cops head back into the basement Jason attempts to
get Maggie’s attention She doesn’t notice him

Suddenly DANNY walks out of the basement talking with
OFFICER CAMP like they’re old buddies Maggie joins them

Jason is totally confused Sneaks closer to listen

OFFICER CAMP
Your brother (inaudible) knows how
(inaudible) put a stop to it

MAGGIE
I don’t think (inaudible)

DANNY
Ill take care of it

OTHER COP (0S)
Hands on the car

Jason turns sees ANOTHER COP right behind him He tries to
run for it But Officer Camp TACKLES him hard

OFFICER CAMP
(cuffing him)
That was so unnecessary

INT INTERVIEW ROOM - MORNING

Jason sits across from a DETECTIVE who looks very unhappy to
be working this early Digital recorder on the table

DETECTIVE
Which one of you geniuses came up
with this little enterprise

JASON
It was my idea

DETECTIVE
But it was your buddy’s equipment

JASON
We were just helping people with
their computers

DETECTIVE
Yeah well lots of people like to
get inside people’s houses for one
reason and then they come back for
another Like robbery Or spying

JASON
I wasn’t spying

DETECTIVE
Uh-huh Hidden web-cams that’s
not for spying

Jason doesn’t want to answer Detective reads a file

DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
You were just in here Talking
about UFOs

JASON
That’s what the extra cameras were
for Just to look at the sky

DETECTIVE
(sarcastic)
Catch anything ‘Cause that’s a
public safety concern right there

Jason’s not in the mood for games doesn’t answer The
Detective sizes him up quiet long enough to make it awkward

DETECTIVE (CONT’D)
You been feeling nauseous lately

JASON
Huh

DETECTIVE
You had a concussion Sometimes
people get nauseous

JASON
What are you a doctor You know
we weren’t spying on anyone so
what am I even here for Talk to
Officer Camp he’s the one acting
weird ask him some questions

The Detective isn’t biting He speaks to the recorder

DETECTIVE
End of interview with Jason Halter

The Detective collects the recorder goes to leave the room
Just as he’s about to exit he stops leans back in

DETECTIVE (CONTD)

You sure you’re not feeling
nauseous

INT POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

Jason sits alone in the same holding cell he was in a couple
of days ago Feels the eyes of all the cops on him

Nausea suddenly overwhelms him He VOMITS into the toilet
Looks up to see an OFFICER unlocking the cell

INT POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON
Jason exits holding Etta Maggie Giles wait for him

ETTA
Honey c’mere

He gives her a tentative hug Over her shoulder he catches
Giles’ eyes warning him to “act normal”

She looks

She goes

ETTA (CONTD)
You told me it was the last time
babe I’m trying really hard to
make this work so you gotta stop

JASON
I’m sorry

at him like she knows he’s not a bad kid

ETTA
I have a shift so just let your
brother drive you home I’m glad
youre safe but we’re going to
talk later About all of it

Jason turns to Maggie

JASON
Why did you tell them

MAGGIE
What What are you talking about

JASON
I saw you with my brother and that
cop No one else knew about us
using those cameras

MAGGIE
I can’t believe you It was Mrs
Yun She called in a complaint
when she figured out she had two
extra nanny cams She said you
were spying on her I was there to
meet you and the police showed up
and started asking questions All
I said was that it was part of your
tech business

JASON
What was Danny doing there

DANNY (0S)
Trying to keep you out of jail

Danny walks up with a cup of coffee Jason backs up

JASON
Stay the hell away from me

MAGGIE
Jason I called him when I couldn’t
get hold of you

DANNY
What’s goin’ on JJ

JASON

(angry)
I said stay away from me

MAGGIE
Jason

JASON
Something’s wrong with him

DANNY
Oh we’re back to that

JASON
Yeah we’re back to that Or do
you want to go hang with your new
buddy Officer Friendly Or maybe
you and Mr Salish can stare at the
sky some more

Danny stops hands up innocent

DANNY
Hey I just want to help little
brother But to be honest If I
didn’t know this was just the
concussion talking youd be
pissing me off

Jason looks from Danny to Maggie paranoia coming to a head

JASON
My head is fine Something’s
happening and you’re both a part
of it

GILES
Calm down dude

He looks at Giles like “You too”

GILES (CONTD)
Look it’s not that bad

JASON
Not that bad What are you talking
about What about the lights
What about what we saw

GILES
Jay
JASON
You were there You saw it
GILES
(sheepish)

We have no idea what that was
Jason is crumbling faster and faster

MAGGIE
We’re all just worried Go home
with Danny take a rest

DANNY

Cmon JJ lLet’s go home
JASON

No
GILES

Go with him

MAGGIE
Go home Jay

Jason looks at all of them his head swimming He was so
sure about everything he knew it was real

Before they can stop him he turns and pushes his way out of
the Police Station

EXT SUBDIVISION - MOMENTS LATER

Jason grabs his bike from the back of Dannys Jeep pedals
off hard through the subdivision

Neighbors seem to stare at him The streets disorienting

He heads for the one place where it might make sense again

EXT TED’S HOUSE - DUSK

Jason hops off his bike before it stops Knocks on the door
not even catching his breath

INT TED’S HOUSE - DUSK
Ted lets Jason in Sees the fire in his eyes

TED
Something else happen

JASON
Tell me what it is Tell me I’m
not crazy

Ted hobbles to his coffee table where the “alien tech” is
dissected open for study

TED
You’re not crazy

JASON
Just show me

Ted flips the sphere around so Jason can read the metal stamp
inside the device “International Patent Pending Germany
9187236701” and the SIEMANS corporate logo

JASON (CONT’D)
I don’t understand

TED
It’s a German surveillance camera
that uses thermal imaging

JASON
German

Not from outer space

TED
I know right

The bottom falls out of Jason’s theories He’s lost

TED (CONTD)
It’s like every step closer we get
they make us take two back But
now we’ve seen through it It’s
all part of their plan

JASON
Whose plan

TED
The aliens man what the hell do
you think we’re talking about All
my life I knew this was happening
I didn’t know but I knew And
fuck them for picking on a cripple
But now Now we know for sure

Jason looks at Ted’s unblinking eyes Glances around at the
piles of books newspapers junk The wreckage of a life

Realizes Ted is a madman And if Jason doesn’t get help
this is his future He backpedals to the door

TED (CONTD)
Where are you going

But Jason’s down the stairs On his bike

TED (CONTD)
Youll be back Wait’1ll they take
one of your friends

Jason disappears down the street

INT JASON’S HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

Jason sits at the kitchen table lining up Fritos and eating
them one by one

Danny brings him some water a pill

JASON
What’s that

DANNY
It’ll help Something we’d take in
the field to calm our nerves
(no easy way to say it)
You gotta go back to Doctor Fleming
tomorrow tell him everything
that’s been happening

Danny hands over Jason’s sketch pad
DANNY (CONT’D)

These are good You should draw
more often

Never in Jason’s life has Danny complimented his art

JASON
I need some sleep

He grabs his sketchbook heads upstairs
DANNY
Ill be here all night You know
if you need anything

Jason pauses Was that a threat He continues on to the
sanctuary of his room

INT JASON’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Once again Jason cannot sleep He tosses in his bed gets
up goes to the computer but his connection is down

Looks out the window at the sky Nothing

He sees his mom come home from work pull into the garage

INT BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT

Jason washes his face Looks in the mirror Is this how you
look when you’re going crazy

INT HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

Jason tiptoes back to his room looks at the staircase sees
the glow from TV in the living room

Danny’s still up sitting next to Etta on the couch They
stare straight ahead neither saying a word

INT JASON’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Jason channels his confusion and aggression into some
sketching QUICK CUTS

- The lights
- The glider
- The ship

Frustrated he throws his charcoal across the room Tries to
calm down Looks at his clock 147 AM

He hears something

The HUM Becoming a ROAR This can’t be happening

It draws him to the window

Getting LOUDER He sees the LIGHTS He opens the window
Behind him his DOOR OPENS Danny is there

DANNY
Jason What are you doing

JASON
Is that in my head

DANNY
Calm down

Jason looks at his brother Looks at the open window This
is it he’s either crazy or he’s not

The RED LIGHT outside fills his room Danny’s expression
turns angry as his MOTHER appears behind him

ETTA
Don’t you move Jason

Now or never Jason JUMPS OUT THE WINDOW onto the roof

EXT JASON’S BACKYARD - NIGHT
Jason lands hard on his feet That hurt

He gets his bearings The LIGHTS IN THE SKY aren’t far He
runs for the gate that leads to the front yard

EXT JASON’S HOUSE - NIGHT
He sees the LIGHTS HOVER AT THE END OF HIS STREET

Behind him the front door of his house opens Danny and
Etta run out after him

Jason speeds to the lights He needs to know is this real

DANNY
Stop Jason

ETTA
Jason

But he doesn’t stop He runs faster

More lights drop from the sky into THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET
They’re coming closer He’s blinded but keeps running
Suddenly the lights are lowered and he can finally see --
THREE FIGURES IN DARK SUITS

Humanoid but with leathery skin helmets red glowing eyes
Jason stops scared Starts to backpedal

The figures are fast close in surround him

One of the figures grabs him Jason fights gets free
Bolts back toward

DANNY and ETTA who are running towards him

DANNY
Jason

ETTA
Baby run

Jason screams as he’s grabbed again from behind

JASON
What the hell do you want

The figure rips off his HELMET

It’s DANNY

What

Jasons reality bends and swirls

This New Danny shouts above the ENGINE SOUND ABOVE THEM

NEW DANNY
Jason It’s OK We’re here

Up the street Danny and Etta take a step closer to him

ETTA
You get away from my son

Jason looks back and forth between the two versions of Danny
He shouts out to his brother

JASON
Danny Why does he look like you

DANNY
Just back away from them Jason

Jason looks at New Danny Looks like his brother Maybe a
little older Locks eyes with him

JASON
Is this how you take people

NEW DANNY
Youve already been taken

Jason is frozen by the words Seeing her chance Etta moves
to grab Jason

New Danny QUICKDRAWS a SIDEARM and SHOOTS ETTA ONCE IN THE
HEAD AND TWICE IN THE BODY

JASON
No

But his mother doesn’t bleed Instead SHE CRUMPLES AND
MELTS INTO DARK GREY VISCOUS LIQUID

The goo soaks into the ground All that’s left is a giant
writhing SILVER-GREY HAMMERHEAD EEL-CREATURE eight inches
thick four feet long

NEW DANNYREAL DANNY
We’re here to take you back

As Jason struggles to understand the two other figures
flanking Real Danny remove their helmets They’re human too

Jason realizes the glowing eyes were night vision goggles
The leathery skin some kind of advanced space suit

Their insignia AMERICAN FLAGS NASA PATCHES USMC LOGOS

These are MARINES a tactical unit on a rescue mission
Along with Danny name patches indicate one marine as “Lt
Collins” and the other as “Leonard”

Jason is dumbfounded His world is inside-out

Looks back at “Danny” standing completely still eyes full of
menace That’s not his brother

He notices other “neighbors” in the doorways and windows of
the other houses Faces staring Figures looming

MR SALISH stands in his window On the front lawn of a
house are the TWO 12-YEAR-OLD GIRLS in pajamas MRS WALTERS
and her dog out for another late-night walk

All of their faces look stern
Jason stands still Shell-shocked hyperventilating

REAL DANNY
JJ

The “neighbors” are approaching Forming a mob

LT COLLINS
Sorry to interrupt the family
reunion but we have to move

REAL DANNY
Dammit Jason it’s me

Jason finally stirs but he doesn’t cooperate He panics
Runs fast Away from everyone

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Jason ducks through yards over fences Pops out onto a
street and --

WHAM He gets CLIPPED by A POLICE CAR
Behind the wheel is OFFICER CAMP
Jason lies on the asphalt clearly in a lot of pain

JASONS POV Officer Camp and his Partner look down at him
shaking their heads in disapproval

Officer Camp grabs him by the scruff of his neck and SLAMS
him onto the police car hood

OFFICER CAMP
Are you confused Jason
Disoriented

JASON
Just tell me what’s happening
Please tell me

OFFICER CAMP
We need the information Jason
Well get it one way or another

He turns Jason around His face is cut He’s a mess As
the Partner pats him down

OFFICER CAMP (CONTD)
Your blood pressure Your rate of
neurotransmitter production How
your pupils dilate how you knit
your brow We want every detail

JASON
Who are you

Jason sees something behind the police His eyes widen as--

Officer Camp and his Partner are RIDDLED WITH BULLETS The
Partner dissolves just like Jason’s mom did and Jason sees
another ALIEN CREATURE slink off into the ground

REAL DANNY
(approaching gun raised)
Jason stay down

But Officer Camp drags Jason to the other side of the police
car Sheltered for a moment

JASON
Is this real

OFFICER CAMP
Youre bleeding aren’t you

Jason touches his face The blood is his it’s real

LT COLLINS (0S)
Come out from behind there Let
the kid go

OFFICER CAMP
You’re teaching us so much

With that Officer Camp DISSOLVES reveals another creature
It HISSES and SPREADS THE JAWS OF ITS HAMMERHEAD
horrifyingly close to Jasons face

BAM A gunshot splatters the alien showering Jason in
yellowish entrails

Jason frantically wipes the gore away as REAL DANNY and the
MARINES run up to him

Real Danny (from here on just “Danny”) offers up his canteen
and reveals taped to the side

Jason’s SKETCH of his brother in fatigues with fireworks
exploding out of his head Taped back together ink faded

DANNY
It’s me

Jason focuses on the sketch the one he did only days ago but
somehow looks much older

JASON
Where the hell am I

REAL DANNY
Youre on a space station Between
Earth and Mars

Jason’s face reflects the absurdity of the statement

JASON
That’s impossible There’s --
(tries to recall science)
Air And gravity Oh god is that
why I’ve been nauseous

Another Marine LEONARD fields the question

LEONARD
Probably The gravity’s from the
rotation of the station it’s like
youre on a big tilt-a-whirl

JASON
Why does it look like home

LEONARD
We don’t know We have ideas but
whoever took you never responded to
any communications All we could
tell from the telescope pictures
was that they replicated your
entire neighborhood

It all starts to make terrible sense

JASON
I’m in a rat maze

No more time The mob of neighbors is approaching

LT COLLINS
Let’s go Here comes Karzak and
Wiley with Bizanski

Jason looks up to see two Marines pulling Maggie through
someone’s backyard and towards them She looks as confused
and terrified as Jason

DANNY
(grabbing Jason’s arm)
Come on

Jason finally figures out how to move again He falls in
with Maggie and the Marines

MAGGIE
Jason What’s happening to us
What the hell is going on

JASON
Just stay with me Danny’s here
well be OK

He hugs her But his eyes say he still doesn’t trust her

The soldiers move with tactical precision forming a
protective perimeter around the kids

LT COLLINS
Just around this block and we’1l
be at Roper’s

Jasons eyes go wide Giles

WILEY
Contact

More “neighbors” appear in their yards move toward them
Another Marine cocks a rifle Name patch says ‘KARZAK’

KARZAK
Lieutenant these freaks are too
close Permission to engage

LIEUTENANT
Just move faster Almost there

Danny ushers Jason and Maggie along

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The group moves quickly down the street toward Giles’ house
The crowd of residents follows faster grows in size

There’s at least fifty of them At the front of the mob MR
SALISH and ALIEN DANNY

KARZAK
Lieutenant

LT COLLINS
Into the yard let’s move

Jason grabs Maggie’s hand and leads her into the yard the
others moving tightly around them

EXT GILES’ HOUSE - BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

The Marines file in ushering Jason and Maggie through the
gate and quickly barricade the gate with a patio table

It’s just in time - the mob hits the gate and starts to push
Jason spots the bulkhead that leads to Giles’ basement
JASON
(to Maggie)
Hold on
He runs over to the bulkhead and BANGS on it

JASON (CONTD)
Giles Get out here man

The bulkhead opens Giles pops out takes in the chaos

Leonard shines a flashlight in Giles’ stunned face

GILES
What the hell --
LEONARD
LT we have Roper Only one more
duck to go
JASON
Duck
LEONARD

Short for ‘abductee’

A CRASH sounds overhead as SOMEONE jumps through a SECOND-
FLOOR WINDOW lands on Jason with a shower of glass

GILES
Oh my god Wiggins

Leonard FIRES Wiggins starts to ooze GREY GOO from his eyes
and mouth But keeps coming

Karzak shoots WIGGINS Just like the others the grey goo
seeps into the ground leaving a DEAD ALIEN CREATURE

Giles helps Jason up

JASON
That wasn’t Wiggins

GILES
This is obviously way more fucked
up than you thought
No time to talk about it --

FLOODLIGHTS light up the yard -- a pool a large toolshed --
and a MOB OF NEIGHBORS at the fence They’re SURROUNDED

Jason and the other humans panic

The mob at the fence suddenly DISSOLVES Their outer forms
melt into grey goo and their inner forms SLITHER UNDER THE
FENCE --

SLITHERING FAST across the lawn THEY GROW into a DOZEN SEMI-
FORMED FACELESS HUMANOIDS - “GREY MEN”

LT COLLINS
Fire Fire Fire

The Marines let loose

Some aliens EXPLODE in bursts of GREY GOO Others keep
coming unaffected by the bullets

One of them rushes Wiley and ENGULFS HIM as they both fall
backwards into the pool

Danny defends Jason as the other Marines punch a hole through
the FENCE to escape but more NEIGHBORS pour in

Lt Collins shoves Mr Salish aside but Salish MELTS IN HIS
GRIP The GOO covers the soldier’s mouth and eyes

The other Marines watch horrified but powerless as their
commander suffocates where he stands

MAGGIE
In here

She holds open the bulkhead doors to Giles’ basement The
group retreats inside

INT GILES’ BASEMENT - NIGHT

Danny and Karzak shut and brace the doors locking them
inside from the horde outside

Jason Giles and Maggie stand by the couch as the Marines
take stock

KARZAK
Kill box Goddammit

MAGGIE
What does that mean

Danny looks to Maggie then to Jason

DANNY
They were herding us into a corner

They hear BANGING on the bulkhead door as the metal strains
But they all know the aliens could get in at any moment

JASON
Danny

Danny looks at him sees how freaked out his little brother
is Maggie and Giles too

JASON (CONT’D)
Who’s the other duck

against the wall Four years

MAGGIE
Where have we been

Karzak looks out a window

KARZAK
I don’t know why the hell they’re
not coming in here but we can’t
wait Dropship picks us up in
thirty

DANNY
Let’s patch up Jason and get out

He pulls out a med kit and starts dabbing Jason’s face gives
him a reassuring look All will be okay

Leonard raises an eyebrow at the Japanese girl-group posters

GILES
They’re hot Don’t judge
(more importantly)
How did you even get here

KARZAK
Piss fire and bubble gum courtesy
of Space X NASA and the United
States Marine Corps

GILES
What did everybody think When
they found out we weren’t alone

LEONARD
Most people were fine with that
It’s more the abduction part that
pissed everyone off

A window breaks upstairs Footsteps overhead The aliens
are in the house

KARZAK
We need to move

DANNY
We need a diversion

Jason looks around the room notices Giles’ modified Kinect
Sensors attached to the model helicopters

JASON
Giles still got your mom’s keys

GILES
To her van Does that even work
Do we need simulated keys to drive
a simulated van

JASON
Everything works We’ve been
living here for a week

Jason unclips a grenade off of Danny’s belt Grins

GILES
My fake mom is gonna kill me

EXT GILES’ HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

A line of neighbors surround the house A couple of familiar
faces among them the YUNS MR SANDERS

The FRONT DOOR BURSTS OPEN Jason steps out unprotected

Like he’s conducting a symphony he raises his hands Might
as well be “Flight of the Valkyries” because --

From either side of him tiny helicopters rise up

The NEIGHBORS start to converge on him but he doesn’t waste
time Sends one copter left and the other one right

Once they’re over the line of alien neighbors Jason clenches
his FISTSand both copters release GRENADES

They EXPLODE CARNAGE Grey Goo and alien corpses cover the
yard as the survivors stagger for safety

Through the chaos A MINIVAN SMASHES THROUGH THE GARAGE DOOR
Stops only long enough to scoop up Jason then speeds off --

EXT SUBDIVISION STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The MINIVAN barrels down the street

INT EXT MINIVAN -— CONTINUOUS
Jason looks out the window

The asphalt behind them comes ALIVE WITH A DOZEN SLITHERING
ALIEN CREATURES They take shape into a pack of GREY MEN
running after the van

JASON
Drive faster

DANNY
(behind the wheel)
This isn’t a Ferrari

THUMP THUMP Two of the Grey Men land on the roof of the
minivan Maggie and Giles huddle in the backseat

THUMP Another one grabs onto the back bumper

Danny nearly pushes the pedal through the floorboards The
only thing between our heroes and death is a Ford Aerostar

Finally Danny SLAMS ON THE BRAKES and the Grey Men fly off
the car as it spins out 360 degrees

ELECTRICAL STORMS cloud the sky as the Minivan speeds out of
the Subdivision and onto the highway For the moment the
Grey Men seem to have given up the chase

EXT TED’S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Minivan skids to a stop in front of the huge house
Jason jumps out runs for the front door

It opens as he reaches it

TED
I told you you’d be back
(notes the others)
Who the fuck are these guys

JASON
Marines

TED
Nice

Karzak and Leonard hurry up the steps

KARZAK
Theodore McKendrick

That’s me

LEONARD

You may not believe what we’re
about to tell you --

TED
I seriously doubt that

INT TED’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Ted’s hand shakes as he drinks from a canteen Some things
are weird enough to freak anybody out

TED

So they collect a few random
samples toss ‘em in their shoebox
diorama and watch Now these sons
of bitches’11 know exactly how
well react when they make a move

(admits the truth)
We weren’t special we were just
available

(off the canteen)
Got anything I can put in this

JASON

You OK Ted
TED

Yeah just -- grey goo
GILES

That’s what their human forms are
made out of It’s probably what
Jason saw the other night when

those kids’ faces stuck together

TED
Grey goo’s supposed to be how the
world ends When nanobots get out
of control and dissolve the whole
planet But it sounds like these
guys use it --

(knocking on the walls)

-- make it solid bend it to their
will I bet the whole place is
made out of that stuff

He starts looking at every detail of the room trying to find
a flaw Even the books have words on every page

Out of nowhere Ted grabs an M-26 Taser from Karzak’s utility
belt Karzak immediately sticks his gun in Ted’s face

TED (CONTD)
What I just need to borrow this

He releases an ELECTRIC CHARGE into the wall The wood
RIPPLES and gives way to a swirl of billions of nanobots

The wood turns solid again as the charge dissipates

TED (CONTD)
It’s definitely electrical But
there’s got to be some kind of
field keeping it all stable
(surveys the room)
Bad guys always get the best tech

LEONARD
Guys we need you to put these on

Leonard hands out CLEAN SUITS (scrubs and sterile shoes)
LEONARD (CONTD)
We don’t want anything from here
contaminating our ship
Giles drops trow right there happy to be leaving
Maggie seeks some privacy to change steps into --
THE DINING ROOM

Old magazines cover the table dust covers everything else

Maggie turns finds Jason followed her Her mascara has run
from the sweat and tears

MAGGIE
(trying to smile)
Can’t let me out of your sight

JASON
No way

MAGGIE
I guess I owe you an apology

JASON
Let’s just get home

Maggie demurely twirls her finger “Turn around”

He obeys starts to change his own clothes into the khaki
fatigues they were given

Jason removes his shirt watches Maggie in a dusty mirror

IN THE REFLECTION -- her BACK RIPPLES like the spinal column
is WRIGGLING

Jason turns quickly just as Maggie pulls on her shirt Did
he really see that Was it just the mirror

MAGGIE
What
JASON
(covering)
Nothing I’m just -- I don’t know

what’s real anymore
She walks up to him slowly

MAGGIE
I’m real And we’re going home

She gives him a kiss Jason accepts it but his eyes say
he’s scared of her

Maggie pulls away gives a reassuring look heads back to --

I don’t have neighbors Or sugar

Danny checks the windows Sure enough every last denizen of
the subdivision is surrounding the house

DANNY
Higher ground Let’s move

He shoots Jason a reassuring look but Jason just wants to
figure out when he can tell Danny about Maggie

INT STAIRS - TED’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Everyone moves up the stairs Ted’s crutches slow him down
Maggie and Jason help guide him up the steps

TED
You guys make up

MAGGIE
(attempts a smile)
I’m on the fence

Jason plays along He’s on the fence for other reasons

As they reach the THIRD FLOOR a loud ENGINE NOISE grows
overhead This time the sound is welcome to Jason

LEONARD
That’s our ride home

Ted motions to a pull down staircase

TED
Through there

Leonard grabs the rope pulls down the steps Karzak heads
up first to clear the room

Giles helps Maggie and Ted up first

Jason and Danny hold the staircase as the others climb When
it’s just the two of them --

JASON
(quietly)
Are you sure we’re all -- what we
say we are

DANNY
What
JASON
Maggie -- I saw something Her

back She could be --

DANNY
No way You’re all on the list
Maggie went missing same as you and
Giles And Captain Gonzo

JASON
But I saw -- in the mirror --

DANNY
In a mirror Jesus JJ this whole
place is a house of mirrors They
designed it to mess with your head
Don’t freak out let’s just get
through this and get home

Before Jason can argue there’s a CRASH below as the front
door is smashed open

INT ATTIC - NIGHT

Everyone makes their way across the attic toward an access
door to the roof

CLATTER of IMPOSSIBLE WEATHER outside ALIEN NEIGHBORS
below Just a little further

JASON
(to Ted)
I knew we weren’t crazy

TED
Always trust your gut kid Even
when it makes you shit your pants

EXT ROOF - CONTINUOUS

As they step through the access door the wind threatens to
whip them off the roof

GILES
(pointing up)
There

The stormy skies part as THE DROPSHIP EMERGES from a rift in
the outer barrier of the space station Beyond swirls of
stars and asteroids hover deep in the sky

The dropship approaches through the thunder clouds weaves
between lightning bolts Jason recognizes --

THIS IS THE “ALIEN SHIP” he saw in the sky only nights ago
The invasion he feared was actually the rescue mission

JASON
(to Danny)
That’s your ship Why didn’t you
pick us up before

DANNY
You threw rocks at our surveillance
drone and drove off in a van
Never make my life easy do you

The brothers share a grin They’re actually going home

Jason turns back to the access door Sees Leonard helping
Ted onto the roof Looks like they made it until suddenly --

-- a HOLE IN REALITY MELTS OPEN right beneath their feet
Like a frame of film burning against a projection bulb

Jason’s mind reels at his first look behind the curtain of
the fake subdivision

JASON
No

But he’s helpless The edges of the disruption drip with
grey sludge LEONARD FALLS disappearing into blackness

TED hangs onto the doorframe as his crutches drop into the
nothingness and his legs flail uselessly

Jason moves to help him but Danny holds him back struggling
to keep his brother from falling in

Ted shares a desperate look with Jason and a final plea --

TED
Just get home

From the blackness below several Grey Men rise up Their
arms become TENDRILS that wrap around Ted’s body and neck

He’s pulled down as the hole starts to repair itself

Jason breaks free of Danny’s grip They SHOUT over the sound
of the STORM that’s pounding down on them

JASON
We can’t leave him

DANNY
No way We have to go right now

Finally Jason relents turns away

The DROPSHIP hovers above them A CABLE ROPE LADDER lowers
Karzak crosses the roof to grab it

But of course this has all been too easy

BOOM A burst of LIGHTNING strikes the dropship It’s
joined by EVERY OTHER LIGHTNING BOLT IN THE SKY as they all
converge on the craft like it’s a lightning rod

The bright electricity ripples over the ship down the cable
AND THROUGH KARZAK frying him

Overhead the ship spirals out of control engines disabled
The group watches in terror as it loses altitude nearly
knocks them off the roof and --

CRASHES into TED’S YARD

Electricity arcing around the crashing ship causes a RIPPLE
of disruption across THE ENTIRE SUBDIVISION

Jason Danny Maggie and Giles are trapped on the roof storm
blowing all around them

Jason realizes That was their ride home

JASON
Oh god
MAGGIE
(to Danny)

What do we do

Danny is struck dumb He just lost his entire squad and the
dropship is down

Suddenly the neighbors are at the access door

Giles Maggie and Danny struggle to push the door shut and
keep the aliens inside the house

ALIEN DANNY forces the door open a crack

ALIEN DANNY
Sorry we couldn’t let your rescue
attempt go any further It was
extremely informative

Danny’s infuriated shoves the door even harder Gets his
wits back shouts back to Jason still in a daze

DANNY
There’s a second ship On the
other side of the space station

JASON
Second ship

Jason stares as his brother strains against his doppelganger
The door finally shuts but it locks from the inside They
can’t secure it Danny puts his back against it Giles and

Maggie help but they won’t last long

DANNY
We have to find a way to get to it

Jason snaps out of it surveys their situation wheels turn
furiously as he looks from one corner of the roof to another

He peers at the wreckage of the dropship The grey goo has
melted away around the sparking electrical fire

Jason sees what’s in there -- some kind of TUNNEL
Impossible to know where it leads But it’s an exit

JASON
I think I got a way in

At the edge of the roof he finds THE LADDER -- the one he
fell off of last week Repositions it

JASON (CONTD)
Let’s get off this roof

Giles and Maggie look scared but Danny urges them on

DANNY
Go

Danny lets go of the door unloads his sidearm at it surely
striking anything on the other side

Giles starts down the ladder Jason and Maggie follow
Danny is last

The neighbors are on the roof Alien Danny approaches the
ladder looks down at the humans climbing

Without hesitation he PUSHES THE LADDER OFF THE ROOF

The humans scream as the ladder falls back a hundred and
eighty degrees -- but catches on the downed dropship

The group hangs over the hole in the fake subdivision like
they’re hanging from monkey bars Below them is darkness

JASON
There’s a tunnel We have to let
go it’s not that far
(off their hesitation)
Let go now

One by one the drop into the hole below them

INT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

All four of them land in a heap on a hard dark metallic
floor They’re bruised and battered but they made it

JASON
I totally thought we were dead

Giles grins But suddenly --

The FLOOR COMES ALIVE with a mass of THE ALIEN CREATURES
They attack wrapping themselves around Danny’s neck Jasons
arms Giles’ and Maggie’s legs

In seconds the humans are overwhelmed

The world goes BLACK

INT HOLDING PEN
Darkness

GILES (0S)
Jason

Still dark

GILES (0S) (CONT’D)
Wake up man C’mon

Through the dark a MUFFLED SCREAM
Jason finally opens his eyes and we see the room --
Dim disorienting A ten-yard circle with smooth walls

Giles is with him Danny and Maggie are with FOUR SCARED
HUMANS strangers he’s never seen before

Two AFRICAN BOYS A CHINESE GIRL A SOLDIER GILES (CONTD)
Hey You awake

Jason nods weakly Looks over at Maggie She’s still with
them Maybe Jason was wrong about her

JASON
(off the new faces)
Who are they

GILES
They’re like us They took people
from all over the world

Danny kneels at the Soldier’s side He’s WOUNDED maybe
dying Danny gives him water from his canteen

DANNY
Wasi pull it together man you
gotta tell me where we are We can
still make it to the other ship

The Soldier coughs takes another swallow of water blinks
away tears and sweat

WOUNDED SOLDIER
It’s gone I’m sorry They took
it out when we were boarding the
group from Dome Three We’re not
leaving this station

DANNY
(losing it)
Goddammit don’t tell me that
Don’t tell me there’s no way out

He stands up beats the wall Everyone else is horrified
If the marine thinks they’re screwed it ain’t pretty

JASON
Danny

Danny catches his breath looks at his little brother and
these kids he just came ten million miles to save

JASON (CONTD)
Well figure it out man

Danny calms down but it’s too late Everyone in the room
takes in the new reality There’s no way home

DANNY
Sorry I know We’ll be --

He’s interrupted by the WALL SPLITTING OPEN and TWO FACELESS
GREY MEN moving in quickly

Before anyone knows what’s happening they grab the Wounded
Soldier and head out

Danny Jason and Giles try to stop them starting a futile
game of tug of war but quickly lose their grip

The wall seals shut behind the aliens SCREAMS echo out as
the Soldier is dragged off in the distance

The brothers slam against the wall to no avail Giles leans
his ear to it listening as the brothers sit in defeat

GILES
What are they doing to him

No one else wants to hypothesize The Chinese girl starts to
hyperventilate her fear taking over Maggie calms her

MAGGIE
(taking her hands)
It’s okay sweetie We’re okay
Hey what’s your name
(points to herself)
I’m Maggie Maggie

CHINESE GIRL
(getting a grip)
Mei-Zhen
MAGGIE
Mei-Zhen

(wipes her tears)
We’ll be OK Mei-Zhen

She flexes her arm and makes a brave face

MAGGIE (CONT’D)
Stay tough

The little girl smiles nods mimics the face

Jason tries to hold it together Looks to Danny

INT HOLDING PEN - LATER
The humans still sit exhausted scared

JASON
Helluva rescue

DANNY
What I get for wanting to see the
old neighborhood

JASON
(grim smile)
It’s gone downhill

For a moment they’re just two brothers again Danny passes
his canteen Jason studies his SKETCH taped to the side

DANNY
When we get back home You better
start drawing again Get your
priorities straight

Jason smiles for real this time

JASON
You got a way out of this

DANNY
Working on it

One of the AFRICAN TEENS says something in his native
language His brother translates

AFRICAN TEEN 1
He says even the Americans got
their asses kicked We’re screwed

DANNY
You tell him we’re getting out
And then we’re gonna take his
skinny African ass back to Earth
and make him famous

From outside the room FOOTSTEPS

GILES
(backing off the wall)
They’re coming back

Danny and Jason stand positioning themselves between the
wall and Maggie and the kids

DANNY
If they grab me you make a run for
it Find a way out

JASON
You’re the marine you go
DANNY
Whoever they don’t grab
(to Giles)
You stay with the kids no matter

who goes

Everyone backs away as the wall OPENS UP But just as the
brothers steel themselves they realize they’re in trouble

This time there are FOUR GREY MEN and they grab both of
them Jason and Danny struggle but no one’s getting away

MAGGIE
No

The Grey Men drag the brothers past Giles frozen in terror
and through the door --

INT TUNNEL

Jason struggles to see Danny as they’re taken in separate
directions Their voices echo along the tunnel

JASON
Danny

DANNY (0S)
Jason You leave him alone

Danny’s voice fades as Jason is ushered into --

INT EXAM ROOM

Jason is pushed into a smooth metal chair As soon as he
sits the metal molds to his body holds him in place

A faceless GREY MAN scans him with a blinding BLUE LIGHT

Jason looks away There in the next chair over is TED
Pale Eyes lifeless

The Grey Man exits leaving Jason alone with Ted
Jason reaches out with his foot taps Ted’s leg

Ted’s head droops Reveals a bloody hole His brain has
been removed

Before Jason can process the horror a stalactite of goo
takes shape in the ceiling over this head -

It forms into a spinning blade

Jason struggles but the chair holds him tight

The blade moves closer and closer

Jason spots something In Ted’s pocket THE TASER
He extends his leg Can’t quite reach it

The blade Lower He stretches his foot out desperately
come on almost almost almost --

The blade cuts him Blood Pain

With an almost involuntary spasm Jason KICKS THE TASER UP IN
THE AIR and IT LANDS IN HIS LAP

Gritting through the pain he aims it with his knees and
stretches his thumbs out to the TRIGGER --

And FIRES blasting the electricity INTO THE CHAIR

In an instant the chair is DISRUPTED (like the wall when Ted
fired at it) and JASON GETS FREE

His head is bleeding but he’s mobile Now -- how does he
get out of here

Takes a look around sees Ted’s seemingly encouraging gaze

The blade has stopped spinning Jason grabs it BREAKS IT
OFF It’s two feet long like a machete

INT TUNNEL - A MOMENT LATER

The blade slices through the wall The goo recedes enough
for Jason to step through

He’s armed and on the run Time to find his brother
An unearthly feature dominates the tunnel

FLOATING IN MID-AIR is a two-foot diameter circular RIVER OF
BLUE GLOWING LIQUID It extends off in either direction

Jason runs alongside it but ducks away when a SILVER-GREY
ALIEN rapidly swims by A transport system

Jason notices the blood trail he’s leaving hears the Grey
Men on the hunt behind him hurries on

INT STASIS ROOM

He stumbles into a chamber lined with vats full of CLEAR
LIQUID In one a HUMAN FORM is floating

Is it Danny He runs to the vat but inside --

It’s Giles Wearing the same “Chicks Dig Me” t-shirt he was
wearing when they were abducted

Jason knows - this is the REAL GILES In stasis

The color drains from Jason’s face

INT HOLDING ROOM

Maggie is distraught Giles or what we thought was Giles
kneels beside her Puts a tender hand on her shoulder

INT STASIS TUBE FACILITY

With the stolen BLADE Jason hacks into the vat holding the
real Giles VISCOUS LIQUID POURS OUT

Giles collapses on the floor COUGHING

A noise in the hall Jason grabs his friend pulls him
behind a stasis tube as --

A GREY MAN enters Inspects the room Sees the broken tube
that once held Giles tracks the liquid on the floor --

-- when Jason LEAPS FROM HIDING wielding the BLADE
The Grey Man bats it away grabs Jason’s neck with one hand
Giles stands up unsteadily behind the Grey Man --

-- and its body shifts Suddenly his face appears where the
back of his head was His free arm grabs Giles’ neck

Both humans are getting choked to death by this one alien

Jason spots the BLADE stuck into the wall He can barely
reach it but his hand closes around it

He drives it through the alien’s head The grey goo melts
away instantly revealing the silvery creature inside

Jason stomps it to mush as it hits the ground

GILES
Oh my God what the fuck

JASON
Weve been abducted by aliens
We’re on their space station

Giles’ head spins as he surveys the space station

GILES
You fell off the roof I blacked
out Did you say alien space
station In space With aliens
(realization hits)
That’s the coolest thing I’ve ever
heard in my life

INT CORRIDORS - MOMENTS LATER

Jason and Giles hurry down a corridor

GILES
So we have no way home we don’t
know where your brother is and
Maggie’s trapped with some kids and
an evil alien version of me

JASON
You put it that way it sounds
hopeless

GILES

planning mode)

Danny can handle himself We
should start with Maggie Do you
know the way

JASON
shaking his head)
I wish this place had a window

GILES
Let’s try to make one

Giles borrows the black blade CUTS INTO THE WALL Digs in
until the blade STOPS Dislodges a piece of the wall

There’s a some kind of clear barrier between the station and
outer space He SCRAPES AWAY until he reveals --

A VIEW OF THE ENTIRE SPACE STATION

They’re in a block on one end of a rectangular platform
floating in the void

In front of them is a line of THREE GIGANTIC DOMES each
housing a different testing ground

The furthest one out contains THE SUBDIVISION
The boys are awestruck

GILES (CONTD)
I’m in space

Jason spots something A SHIP HOVERING OVER THE LAST DOME

JASON
The second dropship
(realizing)
The other soldier was lying He
was one of them too

GILES
Translate

JASON
We’re going home

INT TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER
Jason now has his bearings and is moving with a purpose

Giles is fascinated by the FLOATING RIVER that seems to be
flowing everywhere

GILES
So we break out Maggie and the
others go through those domes and
catch our ride What about the
vicious shape-shifting aliens

JASON
I don’t know They’re weak without
that grey goo all around them

GILES
Tell me what Ted said about that

JASON
Something about them needing a
field to keep it stable Like how
the Kinnect works

GILES
Exactly Except the field
generator would have to be huge

Jason stops Considers Giles words --

JASON
Or all around us

Turns to the RIVER OF BLUE GLOWING LIQUID flowing down the
tunnel and throughout the space station

Giles gets it laughs They’ve found the power source

GILES
So what’s the plan

Jason grits his teeth with resolve --

JASON
I think we might have to kill you

GILES
(losing his smile)
Is it too late to vote for a
different plan

INT TUNNEL OUTSIDE HOLDING PEN

Jason and Giles hang back a dozen yards from the familiar
circular wall of the holding pen

They duck around a corner as TWO FACELESS GREY MEN walk by

INT HOLDING PEN

Alien Giles sits with Maggie and Mei-Zhen He’s attempting
to console them but we know he’s a monster

FOOTSTEPS approach

Maggie Mei-Zhen and the African Teens cower in a corner as
Alien Giles stands surprised to see --

ALIEN GILES

Jason
MAGGIE
(standing relieved)
Jason
JASON

C’mon we’re getting out of here
As he guides them out --

ALIEN GILES
How did you get free

JASON
(looks at Maggie)
I just had to realize what was
real

Just as Alien Giles exits -- he sees REAL GILES STANDING
THERE WITH THE TASER

ZAP INSTANTLY the goo melts off of him

Jason lunges with the BROKEN BLADE and CHOPS THE SLITHERING
INNER FORM in half

Maggie is in shock but furious that this thing had her
fooled She steps on its head SQUISH

MAGGIE
You have got to be kidding me
(looks at Real Giles)
So he’s --
Jason cuts her off with a KISS She kisses back

JASON
I’m sorry

GILES
(interrupting)
Uh excuse me Aliens

They hear a SCREAM from down the hall where Danny was taken

JASON
Danny

INT EXAM ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Jason cuts into the room which looks just like the one he
escaped from

DANNY is on a chair BLEEDING and UNCONSCIOUS Is he dead

Jason runs to him -- and his skull is intact Without
hesitation he SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE

JASON
Wake up

He shoots a Taser charge into the chair Danny is free

DANNY
(stirring)
Ow I’m much better at rescuing
than you
JASON

The second drop ship It’s still
out there Near the Subdivision

Danny lights up

INT TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER
The entire group is finally together and on the move

JASON
We saw the path All the domes are
connected If we can get out of
here and into the first one --

But they get to a corner hide in a NOOK and peek around

Ahead of them is

INT CENTER CHAMBER
A large room the biggest we’ve seen A hive of activity

FLOATING RIVERS from several tunnels flow into a large LIQUID
SPHERE in the center The Sphere hovers over an ABYSS

Beyond the Sphere on the opposite side of the room is THE
WALL OF THE FIRST DOME

But between our group and their goal HUNDREDS of GREY MEN
criss-cross the room blocking the way

INT TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Jason checks the Taser trades a look with Danny Only one
charge left

GILES
(whispering)
The sphere I bet it’s a power hub
for the field that keeps all that
goo stable We disrupt it --

JASON
All these bad guys collapse in a
big puddle

DANNY
What are you guys talking about

JASON
We’re gonna try to blow a fuse

He takes the machete from Danny Pulls the conductive cables
from the end of the Taser winds it around the metal blade

GILES
Nicely done sir

JASON
Been hanging around you too long

DANNY
How the hell are you gonna get
close to that thing

Maggie notices a cadre of GREY MEN approaching from the
tunnel behind them They’re about fifty yards away

MAGGIE
Can you guys figure it out
They’re coming
JASON
All I need to do is get close
enough to fire the charge
Danny knows his little brother is about to risk his life

DANNY
You sure

JASON
I’m doing it My choice
(re Maggie et al)
Just keep them safe

The Grey Men are close The leader notices them steps
forward It’s Alien Danny

Danny steps up to defend Maggie and the others But he’s
weaponless This might be a short fight

The Alien sends its arms out in WHIPPING TENDRILS Slashes
the air around Danny missing him by millimeters

Alien Danny moves in close SMASHES Danny against the wall
DANNY
(to Jason)
Alright go Now
Jason finishes rigging his CONDUCTING ROD
One charge left This better work

GILES
Don’t miss

Jason leaves the tunnel and enters

INT CENTER CHAMBER
Jason hides in the nooks in the architecture trying to pick

out the best route to the center The GREY MEN are all
around they’re going to notice him any second

INT TUNNEL

As Maggie and Giles cower behind him Danny’s getting beaten
badly He’s running out of options

INT CENTER CHAMBER
Jason sees a path MAKES A RUN FOR IT

He BOLTS THROUGH THE CROWD OF GREY MEN All he needs to do
is get close enough --

THE SPHERE looms close --

He cocks his arm Grips the Taser

He runs right up to the EDGE OF THE ABYSS

Squeezes the trigger to activate it --

Nothing happens

The blade should arc with electricity It doesn’t
The Taser is dead

He’s surrounded GREY MEN close in on him

INT TUNNEL

Alien Danny whips his tendrils at Danny PULLS HIS LEGS OUT
FROM UNDER HIM Danny is on the ground

His double moves in for the kill Danny scrambles backwards
backs himself up to a wall

He’s NOSE-TO-NOSE with his own face breathing hard
straining with every muscle he’s got TENDRILS wrap around
his throat start to CHOKE HIM OUT

With his last ounce of strength DANNY PUNCHES INTO ALIEN
DANNYS CHEST Grabs onto something PULLS

He RIPS OUT the INNER ALIEN like he was ripping out the
alien’s spinal column The shell of Alien Danny collapses
into grey goo

He CRUSHES THE ALIEN with his hands SPLAT
One African Teen cheers and his friend translates
AFRICAN TEEN 1
He takes back what he said about

Americans

They all run to end of the tunnel where they see --

INT CENTER CHAMBER -— CONTINUOUS
Jason about to be overwhelmed by the GREY MEN

Jason looks at the sphere pulsing with energy sending waves
back along the floating river

Considers the abyss below the sphere fading into black
Considers the aliens closing in on him
Considers his hands

He looks up sees Giles Giles knows what he’s thinking
Slowly regretfully nods “That’1l work”

Danny sees what his brother is thinking

DANNY
No

Jason turns AND DIVES TOWARD THE SPHERE Alien tendrils lash
at him just missing

MAGGIE
Jason

Lands inside the SPHERE

FLASH TO GREY

INT SPHERE
Jason fights to breathe as the goo consumes him

But his body has done what the Taser was supposed to -- it’s
like he’s stuck his finger in a light socket

There’s a HUGE ELECTRIC SHOCK --

-- AND THE SPHERE COLLAPSES with a huge SPLASH sending Jason
crashing to the feet of the other humans

THE FIELD HAS BEEN DISRUPTED

The FLOATING RIVER collapses like a LIT FUSE Everything
made of grey goo in its path DESTABILIZES

The HUNDREDS of GREY MEN in the chamber freeze in panic a
split second before their human forms MELT AWAY

The floor is suddenly covered with HUNDREDS OF FOUR-FOOT
CREATURES slithering for their lives

The entire SPACE STATION RUMBLES The walls start to SHAKE
and BUCKLE
Danny and Maggie are next to Jason who’s unconscious
GILES
I think we just took out the whole
power grid
(realizes what that means)

We need to go Now
Maggie gives Jason MOUTH TO MOUTH He COUGHS and wakes up
Danny pulls him to his feet

DANNY
Let’s get to that ship

Giles scoops up Mei-Zhen

They look at the room full of crawling squirming aliens that
they have to cross

MAGGIE
Oh boy

The group STOMPS ACROSS the now defenseless but still
disgusting aliens They crunch and ooze beneath their feet

All the way to the edge of the first DOME

INT DOME WALL - CONTINUOUS

They approach the gigantic curved wall

Jason steps forward Reaches out a hand --

-- and it pushes right through the Dome Wall

Another RUMBLE The FLOOR BEGINS TO SHAKE THE CARPET OF
ALIENS slither toward them as the chamber behind them begins
to COLLAPSE and DISSOLVE

JASON
Come on

They run into the FIRST DOME

EXT DOME ONE - CHINESE CITY - DAY

As though they were dropped in the middle of Shanxi Province
in Northern China

An intersection with a park where old men play Go street
vendors hawking warm pork buns cars rolling by

Completely real but our group knows it’s not

MEI-ZHEN
Stay tough

MAGGIE
Damn right

They hurry forward as fast as they can trying to stay close
to where they know the boundary is

GILES
This is unbelievable Just like
home

JASON

Sure until your family starts
trying to kill you

A few of the fake Chinese people notice them

Suddenly a STATIC CRACKLE overhead HOLES MELT AWAY in the
BLUE SKY revealing the BLACKNESS OF SPACE beyond

MAGGIE
Oh my god

The city begins to quake and destabilize around them

JASON
Faster

The locals chase them as the facades begin to melt away
The group is OUT-RUNNING A WAVE OF DESTRUCTION

Mei-Zhen points to the front window of an antique shop where
an EXIT HOLE has melted open

They run towards it and jump through back into --

INT FLOW TUNNEL BETWEEN DOMES - CONTINUOUS

They run along the corridor of the space station The
FLOATING RIVER IS HERE but it’s COLLAPSING QUICKLY

Aliens from the Chinese city continue to follow but as the
WAVE catches up with them they LOSE THEIR HUMAN FORM

The humans keep running adrenaline and survival pushing them
forward towards another MASSIVE WALL

This time there’s no hesitation They run right through to--

EXT DOME TWO - BOTSWANA VILLAGE - DAY

The bushland of Northern Africa Dust and red clay Small
brightly colored homes People head to market carrying
parcels on their heads

The villagers stop and focus on the intruders Our group
doubles their pace as the landscape ripples with instability

JASON
Which way

AFRICAN TEEN 1
We got out through there

The boy directs the group to an -
OPEN-AIR MARKET

Narrow aisles with rows of stalls fruits vegetables
spices raw meat clothes It all goes by in a blur

The WAVE OF DESTRUCTION is right behind them
Holes start to appear in the bright blue sky as the space
station continues its rapid destabilization Market vendors

MELT AWAY even DOGS ON THE STREET turn into the grey goo

AFRICAN TEEN 1 (CONT’D)
There

The kid heads for a stall selling rugs VANISHES into a HOLE
in a hanging tapestry The others follow

INT FLOW TUNNEL BETWEEN DOMES - CONTINUOUS

Back in the space station Running Another Wall --

EXT DOME THREE - THE SUBDIVISION - NIGHT

And they’re back in their familiar neighborhood But the
entire Subdivision is melting like a Dali clock

TELEPHONE POLES fall liquefy into grey sludge

Perfect LAWNS boil and churn Driveway basketball hoops
wilt Tricycles Mailboxes

HOUSES shudder and COLLAPSE as they run down the street The
ASPHALT beneath their feet flows away like grey lava

As they run towards a gaping hole in the sidewalk a “Welcome
to the City of Reunion” sign disintegrates
Right there in front of them is JASON’S HOUSE
JASON
That’s got to be it In the
backyard

The group bolts as fast as they can through the fence into
the area behind Jason’s house --

EXT JASON’S BACKYARDTHE EDGE

-- and see the DOME SKY ABOVE GO BLACK

Jasons house is melting away behind them

There it is -- at least 10000 feet in the air

THE DROPSHIP Just like the one that crashed

It must know they’re there -- it’s getting closer

But all around them THE SPACE STATION IS SELF-DESTRUCTING
The ship lowers 5000 feet 3000

In seconds there’s a ladder hanging down And a familiar
face leaning out --

Wasi the SOLDIER FROM THE HOLDING PEN But this time it’s
the real version He helps usher the humans aboard

Giles carries Mei-Zhen up first
The African teen boys go next

Now Maggie
Now Jason The Subdivision nearly gone from existence

Danny steps to the ladder But with a sickening WHOOSH of
AIR the artificial atmosphere inside the station is GONE

Danny is SWEPT OFF HIS FEET by the sudden loss of pressure
He’s SUCKED THROUGH THE AIR towards a HOLE in the fake sky

THE ROPE LADDER holding Jason and Maggie also FLIES UPWARDS
Maggie SCREAMS grips the ladder for dear life --

Jason holds the ladder with ONE HAND and REACHES OUT --

-- and CATCHES DANNY with the other

The three of them are being PULLED TOWARD THE VACUUM OF
SPACE their fingers slipping They can’t make it --

But at the last possible second Giles grabs tight to Maggie’s
hand and begins to pull them in

JASON GRIPS DANNY’S HAND - pulls with all his might

Finally they fall onto the floor of the ship WHOOSH The
AIRLOCK door closes They’re safe

EXT SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

The dropship pulls away from the evaporating space station

INT DROPSHIP - CONTINUOUS

Out a window everyone looks at the remains of the space
station Nothing but a cloud of mist in the depths of space

They made it

Danny Jason and the rest of the abductees start to float in
the zero-gravity

A PILOT calls back from the controls
PILOT
Get comfortable folks We gota
long ride back

Giles notices something out the opposite window points

GILES
Look

Far in the distance a tiny blue sphere shines like a star
It’s Earth

Danny pats Jason on the back Maggie pulls him close He
and Giles share a grin

Jasons eyes sparkle with renewed energy hope
He’s going home

FADE OUT
