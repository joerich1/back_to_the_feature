ONE SALIVA BUBBLE

FADE IN
INT HIGH-TECH TRACKING STATION - NIGHT

A top-secret experimental offensivedefensive military
installation hidden away in the countryside outside Philadelphia
Pennsylvania

CLOSE on a beautiful intricate state of the art computer panel as
it is lifted out of a large console A huge dimly lit display
board sporting a galaxy of small running lights looms above

The panels removal creates a large vulnerable opening inside of
which is a massive confluence of electronics

As a small group of refined well-groomed SCIENTISTS studiously
examine the removed panel their intense concentration is
periodically disrupted by the hysterical guffaws of a nearby group
of three uniformed SECURITY GUARDS who appear to be refugees from
the Neolithic period

The Guards totally oblivious to the Scientists are regaling each
other with pitiful and infantile jokes

GUARD 1
so she said to him poo-

poo on your pee-pee

The Guards explode like a pack of howling hyenas The Scientists
glance over at them with a look that seems to say How is it
possible for us to be sharing the same planet

GUARD 2
Did you just cut a big one or is
Suzie back in town

Guard 3 the biggest Neanderthal of the bunch stops laughing long
enough to contribute a rude tounge-flapping raspberry during the
course of which

CLOSE ON FLAPPING TONGUE

Unbeknownst to him Guard 3 jettisons a perfect saliva bubble out
into the air and we follow it through space across the room past
the unknowing refined well-groomed Scientists and down into the
microscopic copper wires creating a tiny seemingly insignificant
electrical short circuit which will soon prove to have monumental
consequences

Unnoticed by anyone in the room a small yellow light emitting
diode blinks on then blinks off

EXT EARTHS STATOSPHERE - NIGHT

A simple streamlined satellite which resembles nothing so much as
a large red onion surrounded by a hula-hoop suddenly stops then
spins on its axis As we MOVE IN CLOSE on the satellite we hear a
loud metallic CLICK and a small panel slides open revealing a
digital clock with a readout of 2400 Another CLICK and the

clock begins to count down

On the bubble rhythmically pulsating between the two copper wires
Bubble MUSIC begins and we roll CREDITS

their coffee gazing out at the lone COUPLE skating around the rink

twisted homicidal power His eyes are like black malignant
bumblebees His sport coat is a hundred decibels The doors fly

driveway of his modest house He stops the car cuts the engine and
cautiously peers out the window Silence He carefully opens the
car door trying to minimize all sounds gets out and tip-toes
towards the front door

Out of nowhere flies a tiny yapping Pekinese dog sporting a
yellow ribbon in its hair and baring its hideous little teeth

Wally breaks into a sprint and is about to reach the door when the
dog overtakes him and clamps its jaws onto one of his ankles Wally
wildly flails his leg around trying to dislodge the beast finally
succeeds and sends it soaring into the air over a hedge

Wally bolts into the house slamming the door behind him just as
the dog jets back on the attack making a hair net out of the screen

they speak he watches the fish in a small aquarium on his desk
Angela holds a thermos of coffee
ANGELA
So all I really need is your signature
here Dr Flord and we can release Newt
Newton for his annual visit home

She puts a form in front of him on the desk

DR FLORD
You know hes not even left us yet and
its as if I miss Newt already When Im with
him of course Im always with him in spirit
as I am with all our patients even now
against all evidence to the contrary I
sense some small spark of mental activity
behind those bulging eyes Perhaps this
is a projection on my part A projection
filled with a physicians unquenchable

hopefulness
ANGELA
Uh-huh
DR FLORD

Has it been a year already It seems it was
only last week when he was flying off to the
bosom of his family when in fact three hundred

and sixty five days give or take a few -- this
wasnt a leap year was it No of course not
Ah remembrances -- remembrances

Fighting off the wave of crippling boredom and mental exhaustion
induced by the Doctors monotone Angela quickly pours a large cup
of coffee stifling a yawn

ANGELA
I only need your signature --

DR FLORD
Was it March of last year when my Aunt was
fitted for her prosthesis I suppose it was
What a difference it made how it changed
her In ways one couldnt possibly imagine
First the new carpeting Inexplicable perhaps
at first glance But on closer scrutiny
however an underpinning of rationality
seemed to emerge

Angela takes a big gulp of coffee grabs an arm of a chair and
lowers herself into it struggling to keep her eyes open The fish
in the aquarium begin to slow perceptibly

ANGELA
Only your signature Please Doctor

DR FLORD
(looking at his hands)
We hear the SOUND of liquid pouring slowly onto the carpet

As if creation splintered into a hundred
million realities was actually nothing
less than the complicated interweavings
(locking his fingers together)
» of one grand design Well-hidden
mind you but upon deeper examination
open the doors
(he opens his hands and wiggles
his fingers)
and theres all the people
(a small vanilla chuckle)
And of course thats when I realized
Aunt Hildy had friends and had purchased
a pet Which brings me back to Newt Isnt it
odd how every Newton since Newts Grandad has
been struck by lightning Newts Grandad
was struck by lightning Hes a complete
idiot Newts father was struck by lightning
Hes no longer with us And of course Newt
was struck by lightning and by golly hes
a complete idiot And all of them were named

watching the Professor
The Texans and the Chinese Acrobats are on opposite sides of the

shape of a X appears One arm of the X connects Horton

Zinzermacher and Newt Newton

The glowing X vibrates wildly and spins sending off small pieces
of the emission in various directions
One piece hits the group of Texans bounces over and strikes the
Chinese Acrobats

Another shard hits Alice makes a sharp right and slams into Sammy
The Stomp Johnson

A third bolt hits Alices open make-up mirror bounces behind her
and nails Mel and Bert just as they open the door to the mens room
This piece of the emission then hits the mirror in the mens room
and shoots back out into the corridor striking the Cashier and Hank
the Barber at the newsstand

The bolt continues out an open door bounces off the three Heinz 57
Chefs the tap dancing 57 Sauce Bottle and the Trick Dog all
standing by the curb then smacks into the head of Bob McNabb
sitting behind the wheel of Company As limo

From there the beam spreads out towards all of Newtonville

The three Chefs the tap dancing Bottle and the Trick Dog are
suddenly compelled to leap into Bobs limo And Bob as if
possessed by the spirit of a mad hot rodder puts the pedal to the

literally change places Newt Newton in the Professors clothes

Newt the Professor Wally and Horton blink their eyes and shake
their heads feeling confused

For no reason they can understand the Texans are compelled to march
en mass to the other side of the carousel just as the Chinese
acrobats equally befuddled and compelled walk around to where they
Texans were standing

Alice and Sammy The Stomp Johnson are still standing side by side
However their positions have been reversed shes wearing his
sharkskin suit and aviator shades and hes wearing her Company A

emergency Dont let him get in

urgent

They pick him up by the elbows and hustle him back towards the green
building Theyre followed by the three Chefs and the Tap Dancing
Heinz 57 bottle

Heres yet another example time was going by
so slowly and suddenly the universe seems to
curve back in on itself
CUT TO
INT COMPANY AB - DAY

The Professor is carried into a large room by Bert and Mel swept
along with the Scientists and the rest of the group that was
outside A nervous CROWD is gathered around a huge green double-
headed pig bomb The countdown panel has slid open and the
countdown is counting down from 000027 Beside it is a large
chalkboard with a formula written on it

II x PIG2 x C (BOB)

The Scientists crowd around the Professor

SCIENTISTS
(variously accusing each other)
He pushed the button no you pushed
the button it was an accident

I didnt mean to do it

SCIENTIST 1
This could be a catastrophe of unprecedented
proportion

THE PROFESSOR
(sniffs the air them)

No no you got it all wrong

The countdown continues The Professor sidles over to the
blackboard and points to the formula

THE PROFESSOR (CONTD)
Let me explain something
(pointing to the formula)
Pi times permutations interacting
geometrically and it goes without
saying arbitrarily --

The countdown is at 000012 People are praying weeping
ducking and covering

THE PROFESSOR (CONTD)
-- times the speed of light which is
very fast I can tell you equals --
(points to the first b)
-- bomb

A huge groan from the crowd

THE PROFESSOR (CONTD)
-- however let me direct your attention
to this little 2 do you see This means
Pig squared and we can clearly discern
or Lucerne where my Grandmothers from that
this pig had two heads Which brings us back
to bob -- b - 0 - b -- bomb or barbecue

The crowd is totally bewildered The countdown reaches zero Both

mouths of the pig heads drop open we hear two loud oinks A

panel in the side of the pig slides open and a large mass of

sticky brownish-red substance glops out onto the floor The crowd

lets out a collective sigh of relief An incredibly delicious aroma

fills the air

THE PROFESSOR (CONTD)

So unless I miss my guess we are looking
at and smelling the best barbecue sauce
in the whole darned world

The three Chefs are the first to step forward filled with
trepidation and envy They cautiously dip their fingers in the
sauce and taste it The incredibly delicious sauce completely
overwhelms them
CHEF 1
(almost in tears)
Twenty years we at Heinz have been
searching for a sauce like this

CHEF2
Manna from heaven

The crowd presses forward to taste the sauce which quickly
degenerates into a spectacle not unlike a frenzied pack of piranha
feeding on a bloated zebra
