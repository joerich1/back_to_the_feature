Alright Then why are we here

TOM
Because youve got vision

He produces a pair of binoculars Offers them up and nods
to the east A freeway under construction a few miles down

TOM
What do you think two hundred
thousand buys at the planning
commission

They eye the hook piqued

TOM
An off-ramp

The men glance at each other We leave them to the details

TOM (V0)
I know an old lady who

inside her She swallowed the
spider to catch the fly

why she swallowed the fly

Takes a breath Phew

TOM
But I do know that Mother Goose
couldve made a fortune in
commercial real estate

People laugh But theyre not sure why

TOM
The single fly theory might
say If ya can just get that
one buyer to swallow with a
little luck youll have spiders
and birds knocking down your
door Or something like that
Fortunately it seems to have
been my door this year

Gestures with the small plaque in his hands

INT ATHLETIC CLUB - LATER

Half-a-dozen late night weight-lifters and stair-climbers
In the back Tom pounds the rubber treadmill at a good
clip Step after step Great shape

INT ATHLETIC CLUB - LATER

The inhabitants have dwindled to a rope jumper in the
corner and a muscle poser in front of the mirror And Tom

Still at it Sweat Resolve Legs burn lungs heave
But he refuses to submit ‘ gs heave

Instead jacks up the speed and angle

INT ATHLETIC CLUB - LATER

The place is empty Not a sound but the incessant hum of
the treadmill Past his threshold a manic force propels
him He cranks the elevation higher his knees crunching
with each stride

EXT TOMS HOUSE -NIGHT

Perched atop a rolling hill Its glassy austerity blends
into the still night sky
INT TOMS HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

The PATTER of slippers echo in the house The spartan
house Obvious he lives alone He appears showered in
his robe and kneels to collect letters from the mail slot
Shuffles through them and heads into

THE KITCHEN

Opens the fridge pours a glass of wheatgrass juice
Meanders to the cupboard pulls downa bottle of pills
Then another bottle Then another Angther Long ugly
pharmaceutical names side by side He uncaps each one and
pours out a dosage of a dozen capsules

Finishes the letter hes reading and pounds the pile of
pills like aspirin for a headache Utter nonchalance
Downs the juice and exits on to the next piece of junk
mail

EXT TOMS HOUSE - NIGHT

The bedroom light goes dark A day in the life

INT THE BAILEY COMPANY - DAY

INT ATHLETIC CLUB - NIGHT

Late Empty gym Tom running Even more intense An
overhead monitor blares details of the crash Footage of
firefighters wreckage burning hillside A REPORTER
broadcasting live As the resulting fires rage on NTSB
agents begin the arduous task of extracting bodies Again
no survivors All 123 passengers and crew dead

The whir of the treadmill slows Stops The Gym
Attendant looks up -- Tom Bailey never stops

Tom dismounts the belt Suddenly magnetized to the image
on the monitor Stares into the pixels Drawn in Not by
the twisted smoking metal Not by the blackened field of
scattered luggage Not by the anxious Reporter

But oddly by the lone SPARED TREE behind her It can‘t
be

CUT TO
A LITTLE BOY
Tom A PHOTOGRAPH of old Nestled in a long-dusty album

Toms in a closet full of boxes Momentarily paused
caught off guard by the memories Shuffles through the
photos searching Purposed

EXT DIRT ROAD - DAY

A valley outside of town Rows of cars and news vans
stretch a mile long Tom parks it on the grassy shoulder
and gets out Walks

Crosses the property line And there she is Reaching for
the sun His great oak Tire swing still intact

He places his hand upon her bark Breathes her in
Remembers

Across the way a farmhouse A victim of years of neglect
Grown over dilapidated boarded windows

This place died a long time ago

Finally moves up the hill into the throng of ONLOOKERS
Hundreds of people standing in absolute quiet Terrifying
silence

He crests the peak his eyes ingesting the horror Black
earth carved deep Pieces of fuselage strewn about like a
childs broken toy Uniformed OFFICIALS wading through the
graveyard bagging whats left of lives snatched away

An empty dog kennel giftwrapped birthday presents a set
of stray dentures

A sickness wells

His eyes dart to the countless people gathered here fe
wades amongst them A REPORTER A FAMILY of locals gawking
with a video camera A MOTHER clutching a doll her dry
eyes searching the wreckage --

MOTHER
(to self)
Have to find her The
recitals in two days She has
to practice

Shell repeat this a hundred times today She turns to

He gazes upon the opposite horizon -- lush thriving fruit
Then back at the crash site -- drygnarled vines Dead

KANSAS CITY
‘Cept here Looks like the

Ironic huh

Tom shifts his weight a self-conscious chill The kid
plucks a grape Stares into it

KANSAS CITY
Uh-huh

KANSAS CITY
Passion

His eyes peer into Tom And hoid

earth soil ripping apart A bulldozer greeting the day

EXT VINEYARD - DAWN

Tom wakes with the noise Slumped against the tree must
have fallen asleep Stands up caked in dirt Gathers
himself

Enough of this He starts out heads for the car But is
blinded suddenly -- A SPARKLE --

From the vineyard Hypnotizing

He curiously heads down the hill -- across the yellow
tape -- but sees nothing lost it Eyes playing tricks

He turns -- the farmhouse So familiar yet so foreign
His CHILDHOOD LAUGHS but whispers in the wind He steps
onto the porch - to the door -- but cant do it Quickly
heads back up the hill when again --

A GLIMMER OF LIGHT reflected from the sun He edges
eloser closerand

Therein the lifeless soila struggling seedling
pushing forth In all this death

He kneels to it Unmistakable The desperate beginnings
of a grapevine An array of colors in its leaves
Burgeoning with strength Astounding Toms awe surpassed
only by the SHIMMERING object tangled in its tiny limbs

GAGEMENT RING Gold Single diamond
His face goes white Mouth agape Heart pounding

tight - deep breaths - they duck down cover their eyes --
and they explode through the barrier -

Wood splinters dirt flies --
And the wild ride comes to an end The dust clears And

wouldnt ya know it the gas pedal innocently pops free
Like magic Heads cautiously poke up

TOM

You okay
AMY

All things considered You
TOM

Oh never better

Breaths of relief Eyes fall to their trembling hands
Still clutched Shared moment of silence Which
eventually gives way to hard belly laughs

AMY
For a minute there
(then)
Were alive

But Tom doesnt answer His eyes turning serious focusing
across the way Hypnotized he climbs out of the car She
watches in confusion as he walks zombie-like through a
8S

patch of trees Each step his face darkening Until he
stops stares dumbstruck At

Headstones Before him Small private cemetery A
family plot And theres fresh dirt piled high An empty
grave Staring back at him The end of the line

She arrives at his side He swallows hard shaken Trying
to form the words Then --

TOM
This is it Where we were
supposed to go

AMY
Tom come on

TOM
Its my grave

AMY
What are you talking about --
(re headstones)
its the -- Wilkins family --

TOM
Maybe not here not now But
its still mine They brought
me here
(off her look)
Jerry Banks Kevin All of
them Wanted me to see it

AMY
What No -- pedal got stuck
that’s all

TOM
Do you really believe that

No She doesnt answer The wind SHRIEKS through the

trees He kneels into the moist soil Feels the edge of
the pit The dirt the bugs the worm

TOM
This is how itll look Feel
Smell
He swallows and climbs down inside Crouches into the
darkness
AMY
Tom dont do this to yourself

But he’s already doing it What hes previously refused

‘

TOM
The older kids used to take me
to this gorge outside of town
Summertime go swimming There
was a ledge A big drop
thirty forty feet that they
used to jump off Kept tryin
to get me to do it with ‘em
But no way in hell I was gonna
One day they dragged me up
there goading me layin it on
thick And I thought this was
it Im gonna have to jump
Gonna have to But -- I
didnt I turned around and
ran got the hell outta there
And I didnt feel bad about it
And I didnt feel like a
coward I just feit
relieved Because I didnt
have to jump

He looks a lot like the kid on that ledge right now

TOM
But this time I cant turn
and run

He sinks into the earth Raw ugly fear Splitting him
apart He cries

What can she say Theres nothing

TOM
This is how it is On that
ledge -- every minute ‘till
its up

AMY
But maybethats better

He looks up at her Forgot she was there As she dares to
presume to have something to say --

AMY
No more road trips to Tahoe no
more skinny dipping with the
local girls You said it
yourself Poor kid

TOM
Wha-

AMY
Youre right Jerry Banks
time is up Kevin His time
is up But yours Isnt

He climbs to his feet unable to disguise the contempt --

on the clock

AMY
No Tom Tom thats not what I
Meant Its not

TOM

But he doesnt know that She senses This man This
mans life Feels for him

AMY

AMY (contd)

AMY
Liar

The look on her face He hears what shes not saying

TOM
Look around how can I deny
this

She says no more watching as he moves on down the Line
trimming at the wrapping like a kid on Christmas morning
Kick in his step whistling as he works

TOM
Its all comin back to me --
pruning at angles curling the
tendrils to support the
grapes all of it

How deny this indeed

Her turn To be taken with him

dancing as only a little girl can Up on her toes
spinning leaping Wont miss her childs recital after
all
MOTHER
My baby my baby

INT FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME

Toms eyes crack open The MUSIC filling him

INT WINERY - SAME

Amy stares as a button-down BUSINESSMAN juggles bottles
like an old carny pro A WOMAN works out an elaborate
scientific formula near the winery lab

PARMHOUSE - PORCH

fom edges outside inhaling these lulling notes these
people And To his sheer wonder something else

WINERY

Sunday Best has an admiring observer seated beside her on
the piano bench HER DAUGHTER Shrouded by a glowing

aura Heart brimming over And shes not the only one

Giggling with delight another light The tittle
BALLERINA A peaceful gaze watching her mother

Beyond JE Ss The eri uarterbac asia
d laugh as pops lets loose anoth a M

And all the rest Mothers fathers brothers sisters

PORCH

Toms eyes dance As only those witnessing heaven and
earth can Tom the wine cures Indeed

WINERY

A CONSERVATIVE WOMAN kicks off her heels to build castles
in the dirt singing a sandbox rhyme A TEENAGE GIRL
approaches Amy with nails in her mouth hammer in one hand
wine in the other --

TEENAGE
(gruff)
Your foundations a little
warped mind if I reinforce
your support beams

AMY
Uhno

The girl hands her the wine and moves on Amy stares into
the bottle Bites her lip dare she Not another
thought -- she swigs it down -- and --

SMASH TO
COWBOY BOOTS

stepping up the porch Heels clicking Arrive behind Tom
A bunch of grapes slide forth --

KANSAS CITY (0S)

hardly surprised Just glad to see him

laughter through the land

TOM

KANSAS CITY

TOM

KANSAS CITY
Minute by minute Tom

Kevin offers his hand ‘Tom takes it suddenly light on his
feet almost weightless as hes escorted down the steps
into the vines

KANSAS CITY
T wanna thank you for what
youve done

TOM
Nearly lost ‘em to the crows

KANSAS CITY
Not what I mean

Tom follows his gazeAmy -- emerging from the winery
bottle in hand She looks up to the porch And sees
Goes white Cant move Cold shock Forces her limbs
into action -- running -- straight for them - everything
in her --

fom looks at her then Kevin --

TOM
Shes been hoping for this

KANSAS CITY
Dont think so

Tom cocks his head -- just as she rushes for them -- and
right past not even seeing them -- to the porch --

To the body collapsed against the rail Toms body Dead
In the vines the Tom with Kevin - thunderstruck --

AMY
Tomi -- Tom

But there‘s no answer from the lifeless man Frantic she
sits him up --

AMY
No -- its ready sweetheart --
no --

She takes his head brings the bottle to his lips
desperate tears -

AMY
Its just like you said -- the

AMY (contd)
people came -- the wines
ready -- drink drink -
please -- its your cure too --
Tom reels His death Her pain

TOM
Oh god -- it’s not fair -

Kevin watches Feeling for these mortals
TOM
She doesnt deserve this She
cant go through this again

KANSAS CITY
She wont have to

Kevin glances at him Knowing smile
KANSAS CITY
Sgood wine You should try
some
He winks and
ANGLE - PORCH
The body jerks conscious cough of wine --

AMY
Tom

He shakes out the stars Swallows the wine

TOM
Strong character Deep
texture Rich aroma Not bad

His eyes sparkle and she clutches him tight teeming He
clutches her back everything in him

Beyond Kevin Looking on teeming himself

KANSAS CITY
Well I got a flight to catch

But no one hears him So without another word he heads
down the steps WE FOLLOW his Path through the
crowdpast the vinesand up the hillwhere he joins
them Brian Jacobs Jerry Banks Blue Collars wife
The little ballerina The pianist All of them

A last look Shining eyes Joyous smiles

Kevin pops a grape into his mouth and vanishes into the

erowd Only the SWEET MELODY from the winery left in his
place And --

Blue Collar emerging from the kitchen in an apron stirring
a bowl of cookie dough --

BLUE
Answer me this How am I
supposed to make snickerdoodles
without cinnamon

Tom and Amy chuckle She helps him up But he doesnt
need it -- never felt better

AMY
Are you

TOM
God I think so

They step into the vineyard hand in hand - but are nearly
knocked flat over -- a pair of Indian braves racing by --
Rusty and Barbara Jacobs spilling over with bliss cupping -
mouths dancing about Best of friends mother and son
again

TOM
Round up the wagons Agnes --
Apaches

Tom pulls out his imaginary six shooter and gallops after
unleashing an arsenal of sound effects But the Indians
overwhelm this cowboy -- he takes an arrow to the chest
And this time he does it right -- clutches his chest and
falls to the ground bleedin‘ his guts out

RUSTY
Now I get to scalp yal

ANGLE - DIRT ROAD

Car pulls up Two doors open Mrs Brooks and Richard
Aw ctruck eyes ingest the vines The people The
celeuration

And Tom On the ground clutching his chest --

MRS BROOKS
Mr Bailey --

RICHARD
Oh lord --

They race across the field -- clear past the crowd -- get
to him -- and hes dying Well of laughter
Sidesplitting pain from the boys attack of tickles He
finally gets clear notices the latecomers

TOM
Oh ya made it

Leaps to his feet a great big hug to Mrs Brooks a firm
handshake to Richard Both speechless

TOM
What‘s the matter You two
look like youve seen a ghost

He winks to Amy But they just stare Doesnt make an
ounce of sense

Tom and Amy lead them into the throng of revelers
Brimming with spirit In more ways than one WE RISE
AND

DISSOLVE 10
