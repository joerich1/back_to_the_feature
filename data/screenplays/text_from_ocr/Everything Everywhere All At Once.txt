EVERYTHING EVERYWHERE ALL AT ONCE

INT APARTMENT - DINING ROOMLIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A round mirror sitting on a cluttered vanity Disco lights
flash across the clutter We hear the opening bars of KARAOKE
MUSIC

BEGIN OPENING CREDITS

Through the hazy mirror we watch as a Chinese family of
three THE WANGs sing karaoke together

They cant agree on a song but they settle on Barbie Girl
by Aqua They are awkward and off pitch But its sweet A
brief snapshot of happiness Then like a flip of a switch-

INT APARTMENT - DINING ROOMLIVING ROOM - MORNING

SNAP EVELYN WANG bursts into the room a 55 year old Chinese
woman in an over sized t-shirt streaks of gray in her hair
and thin outdated designer glasses

The tiny dining room is overpopulated with workout equipment
self-help and inspirational business books an old TV playing
a Chinese soap opera a live security feed for the laundromat
downstairs a rice cooker spewing steam and a microwave with
one minute to go It is a still life of chaos

Evelyn sits and looks down at years of tax documents and old
receipts Picking up one of the receipts she decides which
pile to place it on She changes her mind and holds the
receipt in the air frozen by indecision

A hand enters frame and grabs hold of the receipt and
playfully throws it into a pile WAYMOND Evelyns husband in
transition lens glasses and an ill fitting polo shirt smiles
down at her

Note Chinese dialogue will be italicized The random pieces
of broken English will be bold for emphasis

EVELYN EVELYN

He nervously clutches some paperwork with colored tabs poking
out
EVELYN

Evelyn grabs the papers but he quickly snatches it back
WAYMOND WAYMOND

The rice cooker BEEP BEEP BEEPS Without really taking her
eyes off her work she opens the rice cooker stirs the
steaming rice before shutting it and getting back to work

EVELYN EVELYN

finish this before AE finish this before my father

(AH steam the table cloths cloths for tonight Then

We can hear the POT BOILING OVER AGAIN

INT LAUNDROMAT - THAT MOMENT

Waiting by a door JOY WANG - 20s sporting a worn down
hoodie and a stoic blank expression stares into a tumbling
laundry machine with unfocused eyes It’s hypnotic A hand
grabs her shoulder pulling her in for a big kiss snapping
Joy out of her daze Its BECKY SREGOR Joys girlfriend She
holds Joy close

BECKY
Thanks for doing this

Joy rolls down Becky’s sleeves to cover up her tattoos and
parts her hair to hide her side shave

JOY
(uncomfortable)
You look really pretty right now

BECKY
Oh you like this hot Mormon look

JOY
Im just telling you now in case
my mom says youre fat or whatever

Joy points at her nose to indicate Becky missed a spot
Becky inverts her septum piercing up into her nose

BECKY
You said when she says shit like
that it means she cares right

JOY
My mom is gonna be EXTRA caring now
that Gong Gong’s here He literally
hasn’t spoken to us in decades and
suddenly shows up-

Suddenly the door opens Evelyn looks from Joy to Becky with
a noticeable pause on Becky
JOY (CONTD) BECKY
Hey Mom Hi Evelyn

EVELYN
I only made enough food for three
people Ill have to cook more
Without waiting for a response she is already up the stairs
JOY
Nailed it
INT APARTMENT - DINING ROOMLIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

Evelyn comes running up the stairs Waymond is halfway
through setting the table

Before Evelyn can object Becky and Joy are in the doorway

BECKY

Evelyn hands Joy a stack of bowls and beckons her into the
kitchen She sloppily strains the noodles before haphazardly
dumping in soy sauce chopped scallion and sesame seeds

Evelyn takes the entire pot back into the dining room Joy
follows still holding empty bowls

JOY
I honestly think its weird but
Becky wants to help Mom She used
to volunteer at the nursing home
with her church or whatever

BECKY
I always learn something when I

EVELYN

WAYMOND WAYMOND

SB AIA PSR TT Does your father even know we

Evelyn thinks about this clearly uncomfortable

A BUZZER goes off Evelyn looks up at the security camera to
see a customer is waiting downstairs at the counter

EVELYN
Eat Fast

She is out the door Joy shakes her head frustrated

INT APARTMENT - STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

Evelyn rushes down the stairs with Joy following behind
JOY
Mom wait
EVELYN
Wait Wait Today no time for

They go through the door into the adjoining laundromat-—

INT LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

Evelyn weaves through laundry carts and customers We now see
Evelyn’s laundromat is as eclectic as she is an old arcade
cabinet a TV playing an old musical signs advertising wash
and fold alterations and even singing lessons

EVELYN
Joy any other day I beg that you
come and eat or call me or
anything But today very busy

Evelyn spots the water stain that Waymond attempted to paint
over It is clearly a different shade of white

JOY

JOY
Mom hes not going to die-

Joy follows Evelyn behind the front desk which is cramped
with sewing machines piles of laundry

A customer with a relatively big nose and a baby carriage is
impatiently waiting

EVELYN EVELYN

EF (HAST iRAEK Welcome how Wow what a big nose
Welcome how can I help you

DEBBIE THE DOG MOM
Um I wanted to see if my clothes
were ready I called three times
and-

EVELYN
Ticket please

The frustrated customer begins to rummage through her purse
Joy peeks into the carriage but is momentarily horrified to
find a fat snorting French Bulldog instead of a baby

DEBBIE THE DOG MOM
Here it is-

Evelyn snatches it out of her hand and heads to search
through piles of pick up laundry

JOY
Mom weve been together for three
years dont you think Gong Gong
would want to know-

EVELYN
Of course Just not now Let him
enjoy his party tonight

JOY
You think Becky is going to make it
through the entire party without
introducing herself to Gong Gong
Have you met Becky

EVELYN EVELYN

JOY

She got someone to cover for her

RICK

little too regularly

Without missing a beat Evelyn picks up a baseball bat and
uses the handle to THUMP a dented air vent in the ceiling

EVELYN
Waymond More customers need help

RICK
(inhaling deeply)
Evelyn You know my wife God rest
her soul used to wear the same
exact perfume

EVELYN

Rick playfully pulls out a party invitation from his pocket

Used to his come-ons by now Evelyn smiles in approval then
spots Waymond and Becky

EVELYN (CONTD) EVELYN (CONTD)

WAYMOND

Becky looks to Joy who gives a mock thumbs up

INT APARTMENT - DINING ROOMLIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Evelyn and Joy re-enter the apartment Hanging precariously
from a shelf by the Security Cam TV are some clothes wrapped
in plastic with two googly eyes and a sharpie drawn smile

WAYMOND (0S)
(shouting up the stairs)
See Theyre happier here

EVELYN EVELYN

Evelyn begins ripping the googly eyes off

EVELYN EVELYN

his brain works-» works-

JOY

EVELYN

Stop changing subject You know
with our auditor shes a terrible
person Targeting Chinese in the
community After two year of
meetings she puts a lien on our
laundromat and you know what your
father does He brings her cookies

45 (crazy person)

Meanwhile in the security camera feed we see Waymonds head
fall forward then lift up again He looks around the store
suddenly very alert He beelines it towards a supply closet
as if hes in a spy movie He begins stuffing random objects
into Evelyns purse and his fanny pack

EVELYN (CONTD)
Everyday here is a battle I fight
I fight I fight for all of us
Everything I do I try to make
things simpler easier

(BURG (but your father)

Waymond resumes his position by the coin machine and gives
Rick an awkward smile before his head knocks forward again
Then he wakes up a little disoriented but continues hitting
the coin machine What

EVELYN (CONTD) EVELYN (CONTD)
A RHER EAS Ue SE sometimes I wonder how he
j would have survived without
survive me

Evelyn watches Waymond in the security monitor as he
playfully mock-dances with the coin machine Ignored again
as usual Joy grits her teeth

INT LAUNDROMAT - CONTINUOUS

Evelyn enters as Waymond reaches behind the machine to unplug
it while laughing with Rick

Joy returns as well and storms over to Becky

WAYMOND
Evelyn you have to see Rick dance
Look he knows all of the moves

He gestures to the TV still playing an old musical As the
two lovers on the screen dance to the orchestral music Rick
follows in time Waymond claps

WAYMOND (CONTD) WAYMOND (CONTD)
Did you know Rick is in the Did you know Rick is in the
community theater He wants community theater He wants
to be an actor like you to be an actor like you did
did URtyay LL Aes NT Maybe you can audition too

Evelyn watches the screen as the lovers dance sing and
circle one another They move in for a kiss A flash of
longing comes across her face

She snaps out of it and hands Waymond the Dog Moms laundry

EVELYN EVELYN
HUE PAABT Give this to the customer
(to Rick) with the big nose
(to Rick)

How much you lose How much you lose

RICK
Twenty But I take tips

Meanwhile Becky is trying to calm Joy down

JOY

(whispered to Becky)
I don’t know how to be any fucking
clearer She can choose You come
to the party with me Gong Gong is
eternally ashamed until he forgets
it all happened at all then he
dies OR we don’t come Gong Gong
is proud of Mom until he forgets
it all then he still dies

Evelyn gasps and shoots Joy a horrified look Joy’s face
falls

JOY (CONTD)
I didn’t mean that It was a joke

WAYMOND
That’s not a very funny joke

BECKY
Hey guys

Becky is looking at something behind all of them Joy sees it
too Evelyn angrily rummages through her purse

JOY
Mom

Waymond sees it now and freezes Evelyn pulls out a 10 roll
of quarters and hands it to Rick

RICK

were very good at math-

WAYMOND

EVELYN

interest You will need it Actors

Evelyn is startled by her volume She finally turns

He is hunched over his cane wearing a white undershirt and
slippers This is GONG GONG He stands by the stairwell with
unfocused wet eyes

laundry and rushes out the door

Joy grabs Becky and heads for the exit

BECKY
Um okay it was nice to meet you

Waymond comes back with noodles to see Gong Gong standing
alone in the room Gong Gong spits on the ground
EXT LAUNDROMAT - THAT MOMENT

Debbie the Dog Mom loads her dog into the car and shuts the
door as Evelyn arrives and hands her the laundry

DEBBIE THE DOG MOM

Joy has one foot in the car Evelyn falters

JOY

Becky looks from Joy to Evelyn No response Joy shakes her
head and shuts the door

Evelyn turns and walks back into the laundromat

INT APARTMENT - STAIRCASE - LATER

Evelyn patiently stands with her father as he takes one small
step at a time up the stairs For the first time we get a
sense of how exhausted she is

INT APARTMENT - DINING ROOMLIVING ROOM - LATER

Back at her table Evelyn tries to finish her taxes while
Gong Gong loudly slurps on noodles beside her

Her eyes are drawn up to the wall in front of her Family
portraits report cards and childrens drawings She sees an
old childhood photo of Joy smiling back at her

She is surrounded by the chaos of her apartment Frozen
holding a receipt

shoot open wide A bright light spills between the crack in

two legs extend from either side as men in medical scrubs and

INT IRS 10TH FLOOR CUBICLE - MOMENTS LATER

The back of the crumpled instructions lay in Evelyns hands
under a desk

The first line reads 1 Switch shoes to the wrong feet

DEIRDRE (0S)
Mrs Wang are you with us right
now

Evelyn hides the instructions in her lap and looks up

DEIRDRE ATKINS a frumpy woman in a cheap suit is poking at
a calculator with one hand and squeezing a hand grip
strengthener in the other

EVELYN
Of course I am here Just
thinking

Clearly frustrated Deirdre takes a big bite from one of
Waymond’s cookies and chases it with a protein shake then
points at a receipt with a big red sticky note on it

DEIRDRE
I asked if you could explain this

EVELYN EVELYN
It is a receipt My receipt It is a receipt My receipt

going poorly

DEIRDRE
I was just hoping you could
enlighten me on how as a
laundromat owner a karaoke machine
would constitute a business
expense

EVELYN
I am a singer

DEIRDRE
What

WAYMOND
It’s true She has a beautiful
voice
(to Evelyn)
Sing a song for her

Deirdre scoffs and shuffles through a pile of forms

DEIRDRE
That won’t be necessary But I will
need a separate Schedule C for each
of these businesses because
based on what you’re trying to
deduct it looks like you’re also a
novelist a chef a-

EVELYN
But last time you told me-

continues to speak indiscernibly

Frustrated Evelyn fakes a smile towards Gong Gong nodding
along as she glances down to her shoes She slips them off
and switches them to the wrong feet

The next instruction reads 2 Close eyes imagine you are
in the janitor’s closet

Evelyn scoffs at the absurdity but she closes her eyes
We see an imagined POV of the closet door

The bluetooth devices in her ears VIBRATE and a GREEN light
blinks on Evelyn sits up straight

The final instruction 3 Hold that thought and press the
green button PS Don’t forget to breathe

Evelyn breathes in and presses the button-

Like the sudden sensation of falling Evelyn finds herself
shooting past cubicle after cubicle until she stops abruptly
inside the closet

SPLIT SCREEN INT JANITORS CLOSET CUBICLE - THAT MOMENT

In a split-screen we see half of Evelyn is in a cluttered
dimly lit closet The other half is still in the tax audit

She looks all around in both worlds What just happened

EVELYN
What is happening

Deirdre looks up clearly frustrated

around It’s Waymond

ALPHA WAYMOND
Shhhh Don’t talk Try to relax

INT CUBICLE Evelyn tries an innocent smile towards her
concerned husband Deirdre continues to ramble

INT JANITOR’S CLOSET split screen slides away

ALPHA WAYMOND (CONTD)
They do not know I’m talking to you
here yet so hopefully I’1ll have
some time to explain I am not your
husband At least not the one you
know I am another version of him
from another life path another
universe I’m here because we need
your help

EVELYN
Sorry very busy today No time to
help you-

Alpha Waymond covers Evelyns mouth

ALPHA WAYMOND
There is a great evil that has
taken root in my world and has
begun spreading its chaos
throughout the many verses I have
spent years searching for the one
who might be able to match this
great evil with an even greater
good and bring back balance All
those years of searching have
brought me here To this universe
To you

Evelyn takes a moment to digest this information

Mrs Wang Hello

16-1 INT CUBICLE Alpha Waymond’s voice fades away and the split-
screen focuses on the tax meeting as Evelyn takes control of
her body there

DEIRDRE (CONTD)

Mrs Wang I’m sure you have a lot
on your mind but I cannot imagine
anything mattering more than this
conversation we are having right
now concerning your tax liability
Need I remind you there is a lien
on your property Repossession is
well within our rights

EVELYN
I know I am paying attention

DEIRDRE
You think Im stupid

EVELYN EVELYN
RARE Maybe

Waymond puts his hand on her lap Deirdre is clearly
frustrated She gestures to a small shelf of trophies that
say “Auditor of the Month”
DEIRDRE
You see these You don’t get one of
these unless you’ve seen a lot of
shit Pardon my French You might
only see a pile of boring forms and
numbers but I can see a story
With nothing but a stack of
receipts I can trace the ups and
downs of your lives I can see
where this story’s going and it
doesn’t look good

WAYMOND
Sorry my wife confuses her hobbies
for businesses An honest mistake

Evelyn looks at her husband hurt He ignores her

DEIRDRE
With this many ‘honest mistakes’
even if you aren’t charged with
fraud well have to fine you for
gross negligence

EVELYN
Youre always trying to confuse us
with these words

DEIRDRE
Didn’t you say you’d bring your

Hey Are you paying attention

INT JANITORS CLOSET Evelyns attention is back in the
closet where Alpha Waymond is perturbed

EVELYN
I cannot talk now Unless you can
help my taxes What is “gross

Waymond grabs her by the shoulders and pulls her in

ALPHA WAYMOND
I know you have a lot of things on
your mind but nothing could
possibly matter more than this
conversation we are having right
now concerning the fate of every
single world of our infinite
multiverse

ALPHA WAYMOND (CONTD)
My dear Evelyn I know you With
every passing moment you fear that
you might have missed your chance
to make something of your life

Oh now you’re here You’re

The elevator door opens Its filled with security guards

DEIRDRE
Thats her The Chinese lady

EVELYN
(at Alpha Waymond)
No This is his fault

Everyone remain calm I need you
two to lie down on the ground with
your hands behind your heads

Evelyn obediently lies down but Alpha Waymond takes her
bluetooths and places them in his own ears

GUARD (CONTD)
Sir please comply

Alpha Waymond reaches into his pouch The security guards all
draw their weapons

He pulls out his chapstick
GUARD (CONTD)
Whatever you are thinking about

doing don’t do it

He pops open the cap twists it to FULL STICK and eats it
WHOLE

GUARD (CONTD)
Sir

He chews and chews The guards lower their guns confused

The devices VIBRATE and glow GREEN He presses the button
His head snaps back as if kicked back by a shotgun

He flashes a devious smile to Evelyn as a security guard
walks over and reaches to grab his arm

He unsnaps his fanny pack which dangles from his fingers

GUARD (CONTD)
Okay thats enough-

Alpha Waymond whips his fanny pack like a pair of nunchucks
right into the guard’s face He recoils in pain

He deftly knocks each of their guns to the ground whipping
them in the face for good measure

The guards pull out batons and circle him It’s a standoff

Alpha Waymond calmly lengthens the fanny pack to full length
prompting the nervous guards to cautiously take a step back

He reaches into a fish bowl on an adjacent office desk pulls
out a fist of little pebbles then drops them into the
unzipped fanny pack

They attack ZIP He starts beating the living hell out of
them with his heavy pack He is incredible

EVELYN
Holy shit

He snaps the packs around one of their necks then punches him
over and over again

He unsnaps then whips the buckle up inside one of their
nostrils He spins the pack then yanks sending the guard
spiraling into a printer

The last wimpy guard runs for the stairs leaving his
semiconscious coworkers groaning on the floor Alpha Waymond
turns to Evelyn

Emergency lighting is triggered Onlookers run for an exit

saving your life Now you can
either come with me and live up to

addresses confused hostages lined up along the cubicle walls

You are about to be graced by the
presence of our sovereign leader
Jobu Tupaki

Two small boots walk into frame stumbling forward like a
drunk person’s A gentle RUMBLE builds with each step

DEIRDRE (BAGEL) (CONTD)
Let me assure you of one thing
Just like every other moment in
your miserable lives this is
nothing more than a statistical
inevitability

A hand gently runs along the outer wall of a cubicle
Directly on the other side of wall push pins sporadically
change position post-it notes change colors and text a
family portrait subtly changes family members

DEIRDRE (BAGEL) (CONTD)
Jobu Tupaki has seen all and knows
all She knows what makes you tick
What fragile branches you rest your
self worth upon

Jobu points a finger at Deirdre Their face is hidden behind
an elaborate mask

JOBU
Shut up Deirdre no one likes you

Deirdre chokes on her words- then breaks down in tears With
her hands in her face she leaps off the balcony THUD

tickling her Evelyn is very ticklish

JOBU (CONTD)

death the brain would turn off the
reflex that makes you ticklish

But here you are blood pressure
rising muscles contracting
pushing out more and more of your
precious life source In a way
this is nice How often do people
literally die laughing

blood off their hands Jobu shakes their head disappointed

They pass small groups of frantic civilians running to

You underestimate how the smallest

significant differences over a
lifetime Every tiny decision
creates another branching universe

attention before

foam of existence Every
surrounding bubble has slight
variations But the further away
you get from your universe the

screaming and pulls Evelyn into a stairwell

catch a glimpse of police headed up towards them

They head back up the stairs

Evelyn is completely taken in by Alpha Waymond’s speech

ALPHA WAYMOND
This is the Alphaverse’s mission
To take us back to how its supposed
to be But that begins with finding
the one who can stand up to Jobu’s
perverse shroud of chaos One who
believes in truth and order

EVELYN

away The exit sign rips from the ceiling Just as Deirdre
drops him Alpha Waymond slips the sign between his spine and
her knee

The exit sign shatters It’s painful as hell for both of
them but at least Alpha Waymond’s spine is intact

As Alpha Waymond painfully begins to retreat Deirdre runs at
him and drop kicks him in the chest with both legs knocking
him back down a nearby stairwell

block it

will place you in a universe on the

you the momentum needed to reach

Alpha Waymond shows her the map of her mind There are three
new green circles for each universe she has jumped to

holding water Every jump opens
another crack causing things to
leak through With training you
will learn to reseal these cracks

Alpha Waymond hands her a plate of half eaten food He takes
a massive bite from a bagel with cream cheese His eyes close
in ecstasy

ALPHA WAYMOND (CONTD)
Cream cheese Ohhhhhh In my

off One of the many things we’ve
lost in our war against Jobu

Between her fingers a large white room with a dark swirling
mass like a churning black hole that resembles a bagel

dancing To no music It’s awkward

it in her eyes It STINGS GREEN LIGHT

this is something I have to do

Alpha Gong Gong wheels up to Evelyn and places the gun
directly to her head His eyes begin to water

ALPHA GONG GONG
Do not make me do this Evelyn

Evelyn pulls a wad of 20 dollar bills out and rips them all
in half GREEN She can barely stand

Evelyn opens her mouth and performs convincing BIRD CALLS

save my daughter

Are you kidding me Again If you

Evelyn looks over to see CHAD - a young handsome chef who
has a captive audience Chad winks at Evelyn who glares back
Evelyn hears a loud ominous DRUM BEAT

BACK IN THE IRS BUILDING Evelyn turns to see an Alpha IT
Guy drumming with two pipes so hard it’s denting and
splintering everything he hits He attacks with a furious
fast tempo Evelyn fights with her spatulas but they break
She throws a monitor at him then battles him with a
keyboard but he drums each item into bits

She manages to hit his earpiece right as he does the same to
her SMACK they both disconnect They’re powerless

Evelyn looks into an adjacent cubicle and spots an Auditor of
the Month trophy For the first time we realize how much it
looks like a butt plug

ZIP The IT Guy has undone his pants He pulls aside his
underwear and leaps for the trophy he’s going to use the
butt plug trophy as a jumping pad

face the Alpha Security Guard

He attacks with a furious series of Shaolin style moves She
battles him until she hears another scream She turns and
the IT Guy now has an even bigger trophy protruding from
his butt Auditor of the YEAR

They furiously attack She cannot keep up But she manages to
pull out their butt props and violently knocks them both
unconscious

the props to the floor Ew
