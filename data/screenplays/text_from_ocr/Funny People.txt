Hello Mr Simmons

GEORGE
Hi Doctor good to see you I
brought my friend Well my lover
my life partner my everything How
are you What’s going on How we
doing

DR LARS
Well your immune system is in the
middle of a very serious battle
The medicine is trying to combat
the disease but in the process it
destroys healthy tissue and
disrupts healthy functioning of
your organs and multiple lymphatic
systems So you are getting
attacked on two levels and we hope
the disease is vanquished before it
and the medicine does damage which
can not be contained

George takes a long beat Ira is pale never having sat in
on this type of moment before

GEORGE
Your accent is very thick Have
you ever noticed that your accent
makes things sound worse than they
actually are You could give good
news and I’d still be like “What
happened Am I still dying”

DR LARS
I’m just trying to help you

GEORGE
I know you sound like a regular Joe
where you come from but here I
keep thinking you’re going to be
torturing James Bond later 59

I’m sure your sense of humor will
serve you well in this situation

There he goes again All so
terrifying because it came out of
your mouth

Matrix

frighten a day

INT THEATER — LATER 109

Ira is performing on stage doing his set He’s doing really
well The crowd is very enthusiastic about being there and

gives him

the benefit of the doubt on most of his jokes

As he continues his set he gets more confident and for the
first time in the film we think he has the potential to be a
strong comic

IRA
I have a theory that Tom Cruise
David Beckham and Will Smith have
mushed the heads of their penises
together I don’t think it happened
in a gay way I think it was rich
dude boredom Just like “What have
we not done guys We’ve done
everything I’1ll tell you one thing
we haven’t done” And I bet when it
happened it was an epic
occurrence It was huge I think of
it all the time I think first
David and Tom touched dick heads
and it was easy just zooomp
because there was a magnetic field
to it And then Will Smith started
approaching with his dick and then
winds started blowing in his face
paper started flying everywhere
and he just couldn’t do it And
they were like “Come on Will get
it in there” “I can’t do it”
Beckham yells “Don’t cross the
stream it’s like Ghostbusters”
And then he does it and “Flash” by
Queen starts playing “Flash Ay-
Ah” And light shoots into the sky
That’s how stars are born I think
Anyway I’m Ira Wright have a good
night Thank you all very much

INT THEATER - INTERMISSION

Laura is s

itting in her seat by herself Ira makes his way

IRA
Okay look I’m not supposed to be

you Because George he doesn’t
want to jinx it It’s not 100 but

CLARKE
Hi sweetie

Hi What are you doing here

CLARKE
Just thought I’d surprise you The
man I was meant to have the meeting
with had a heart attack I was
waiting in reception for him it
was unbelievable--

LAURA
Wow

CLARKE
The next minute this Chinese George
Clooney guy comes running past with
the - what’s it called The
defibrillator - and started zapping
him

LAURA
Right

CLARKE
It was like an episode of ER but
with Chinamen I’ve missed you

George appears behind Laura sees Clarke Clarke points at
him smiling

CLARKE (CONTD)
I know you

GEORGE
Yes How you doing 126

LAURA
This is George Simmons He had a
big comedy concert last night And
so I asked him to pop by and come
visit

GEORGE
I hope that’s good

There is an awkward moment Clarke was unprepared for this
He politely smiles and gives George a compassionate look the
type of look you give a man you think is dying

CLARKE
I love the stand up comedy How’d
it go

GEORGE

They didn’t boo me off the stage
so that was a plus

CLARKE
They’re a bunch of bloody cheese
eaters up here

GEORGE
They were very nice yeah You have
a very nice family man And a
great home

night

IRA

You know they didn’t boo me off
or anything

GEORGE

LAURA
They just popped by I gave them a
tour of the house We were going to

since youll only be in town a few
days

CLARKE
No stay That’s a great idea The
more the merrier

GEORGE
Okay let’s do that then

IRA
(very nervous)
Thank you

Ira shoots George a concerned look then wanders off
uncomfortable leaving George and Laura

LAURA
You can’t tell him that you’re

LAURA
I’ve been married for twelve years
now and I have kids and I can’t

GEORGE
Of course sure I’1l do that

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT 127

Everyone is seated for dinner including the kids They are
eating pizza As Clarke drones on about business George and
Laura share a look

CLARKE
People never thought China would do
this much business with the US
but I never saw it as a big deal
You look at it like this they’ve
got a billion people we make all
kinds of cool shit they find out
about the cool shit on the Internet
and stuff and they’re going to
want the cool shit

GEORGE
Cool shit’s universal

CLARKE
China’s been good but I’m trying
to get into North Korea now That’s
the next frontier Those people
would blow you for a Wii Fit

Ira shifts uncomfortably nervous that they are at the table
with Clarke

127 127

IRA
This is really good pizza You
know they say New York has the
best pizza and I always thought
pizza in LA was only okay But
who’d have thought Marin County is
where they’re hiding the good
pizza pies Pisan

No one at the table laughs

LAURA
Clarke speaks fluent Chinese

IRA
Really You speak Cantonese or
Mandarin

CLARKE
Well played Ira Mandarin

GEORGE
Well gayed Ira

CLARKE
It’s a bloody hard language though
George

Clarke chuckles then yells something at the girls in
Chinese They yell something back in Chinese and it goes
back and forth

IRA
That was like a scene from Deer
Hunter

George pretends to shoot Ira in the head

GEORGE
Mao

CLARKE
Girls you can go watch TV Go on
Whatever you want to watch

The girls leave the room
CLARKE (CONTD)

So George How’s the fight going
mate

LAURA

Clarke This is not something that
he wants to talk about right now
He has to think about it every day
of his life and he’s taking a
break from it right now

(over-acting)
It’s such a shame that somebody who
has brought so much joy to so many
people has to go through this
Shit

George looks amused that Laura went for the big lie

GEORGE
Laura we don’t need to speak in
code I’m sick I think about it
all the time

CLARKE
Mate I don’t how you do it I
would be crying in my panties if I
was you I worship guys like you
That attitude Have you considered
Eastern medicine

GEORGE
Well I don’t know if this is
considered Eastern medicine but
I’ve been eating a lot of rhino
cock

Clarke is stunned for a second then bursts into laughter

IRA
For the last time stop calling me
rhino

CLARKE

INT THE IMPROV - MOMENTS LATER 177

On-stage Ira does his act He is much more comfortable than
we have ever seen him on stage before He is no longer
searching for his comic identity He has found a way to be
himself and tells jokes which are more personal than we have
seen before

IRA
My friends are very sexually
aggressive which is hard for me
We’‘1ll watch television and they’1l
just see a hot girl come on And
they’1l just be “Man I want the
fuck the shit out of that girl
man”

ANGLE ON GEORGE
He watches from the back of the room
IRA (CONTD)
And I can’t even say that Like I
can’t even pretend that I would do
that I see a hot girl on TV and
I’m like “Man I would friend the
shit out of her”
Mark Leo and Daisy are in the audience laughing
IRA (CONTD)
Friend her all night I’1l be her
girlfriend I would drive her to
the airport
ANGLE ON GEORGE
He’s watching but not showing any emotion
IRA (CONTD)

I would hold her purse while she
shopped All over her tits

good
GEORGE

So I thought a lot about what you
said in the car to me A few of
those things might have been
accurate You tried to help me and
I’m sorry I put you in the middle
of all that stuff I’m better in my
body My brain has a ways to go
though

Ira softens a little

IRA
How are you doing Are you doing
okay

GEORGE

I don’t know Ira I don’t know
George trails off

GEORGE (CONTD)
I caught your whole set the other
night Ira Nice You’re getting a
rhythm You’re starting to be the
Ira I like in real life on-stage

IRA
Thanks Yeah I’ve been getting up
a lot lately

GEORGE
You were funny and it was a fart-
free set I wrote some stuff down
that night Some jokes Do you want
to hear them

IRA
You what

GEORGE
I couldn’t stop thinking of jokes
for you last night It was bizarre
I’m not saying they’re good jokes
but I tried

George pulls out a wad of handwritten notes from his pocket
Ira watches this surprised

181 181

IRA
You actually wrote them down

GEORGE
Yeah my fucking memory’s horrible
The thing you did about the Wii Fit
thing What was that

IRA
Oh my video game told me I’m fat
The ultimate betrayal

GEORGE
Right Right You could maybe say
“That’s like my pot telling me I’m
lazy”

IRA
Oh that’s really funny

GEORGE
The Wii is similar to my
grandmother She used to tell me
I’m getting chubby and then bring
me chicken parmigiana “Why are you
so fat”

IRA
That’s really funny It’s true the
video game made me fat It is like
my grandmother “Why are you so
fat Here’s four gallons of
chocolate milk” She would always
do that

GEORGE
That’s good

IRA

I got one I’ve been afraid to tell
now about Viagra It’s like my
grandfather takes Viagra and he
thought he was titty-fucking my
grandmother but then he realized
that he was just titty-fucking his
own balls

Ira and George laugh at this
GEORGE

That’s funny You’ve got to do that
one 181

As the camera pulls back George continues to pitch Ira jokes
for his act the first selfless act we’ve seen him commit in
the entire film As their friendship rekindles we
