Opening credits over black Slowly we begin to hear the
sound of ocean waves in the distance calmly lapping against
the shore slowly building in volume

EXT - ROAD JUST OUTSIDE OF TOWN - DAY 1

A barren road on the outskirts of a town in the Palouse
region of northern Idaho

Then a bus appears coming down the road It pulls over at a
bus stop letting out a single passenger The camera stays
wide as the person heads toward town

CUT TO

VIRTUAL CLASSROOM - DAY 1A

We see fifteen or so squares in a virtual classroom The
STUDENTS are all college-aged most of them look distant and
bored A couple of them on mute are obviously having
conversations with people outside of the shot

The center square conspicuously has its video turned off The
name on the square reads “INSTRUCTOR”

CHARLIE (VO)

Like we discussed yesterday I
really want you all to focus on
topic sentences more Too many of
you are rushing into examples in
your body paragraphs It’d be good
for everyone to review the
paragraph structure PDF I sent you
a few weeks ago

A few students shake their heads clearly a bit overwhelmed

CHARLIE (VO)

I know these rules can feel
constraining But remember the
point of this course is to learn
how to write clearly and
persuasively That’s how you can
effectively communicate your ideas

A chat dialogue to the whole class comes up “why can’t he
get his camera fixed”
1B

1c

CHARLIE (VO)
(chuckles)
Chris I imagine that was supposed
to be a private chat that you sent
to the whole class well done

Everyone laughs vaguely The shot begins to pull in to the
instructor square

CHARLIE (VO)
And yes the camera on my laptop
still doesn’t work Believe me
youre not missing much Oh--and
for those of you who still haven’t
given me paper three I need it by
Wednesday no exceptions

The shot is now pulled all the way in to the instructor
square In the background we begin to hear the distant sound
of ocean waves lapping against a shore

CHARLIE (VO)
And remember the more you revise
these essays the better The more
you change chances are you’1l
express your thoughts and ideas
more clearly and persuasively
Alright

As he finishes talking the shot is now fully black The
sound of the waves increases

TITLE THE WHALE 1B
After a moment the title and the waves fade out

We begin to hear the faint sounds of two men grunting and
moaning in the middle of performative sex

TITLE MONDAY 1c

CUT TO

INT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 2

A desolate two-bedroom apartment in a cheaply constructed
building

CHARLIE a man in his late 40s weighing around 600 pounds is
on the couch masturbating to gay porn playing on a laptop on
a rolling desk

He struggles to reach his penis bending over awkwardly His
breathing becomes more shallow as he maneuvers his hand
around his stomach

Suddenly he has a sharp pain in his chest He doubles over

He starts to reach for his phone an old android with a
broken screen but he has another surge of pain He
accidentally knocks the phone to the floor it bounces
underneath the couch

He leans back struggling to calm himself down The gay porn
continues to play in the background

In his panic he reaches in between some couch cushions and
takes out a folder Inside the folder is a well-worn essay
with a “C- grade written on the cover page along with a few
notes The title of the essay is “Moby Dick” He looks at it

CHARLIE
(reading)
“In the amazing book Moby Dick by
the author Herman--”

Another wave of pain forces him to stop reading A knock at
the front door Charlie looks Just then he’s hit with a
wave of pain He clutches his chest groaning loudly

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Liz

Another knock
CHARLIE (CONTD)
Just use your key open the door
just--
Another wave of pain Charlie groans again Finally the
front door opens and THOMAS 19 appears He wears a shirt

and tie holds a few books

THOMAS
Oh my God

Charlie looks at him confused It’s obviously not who he was
expecting to see

CHARLIE
Who are--

Charlie leans forward in pain again Thomas comes further in
THOMAS
Oh gosh are you-- Should I call
an ambulance I should call an
ambulance--

Thomas notices the gay porn still playing Charlie reaches
forward and shuts the laptop Thomas takes out his phone
frantic Charlie extends the essay to him

CHARLIE
Read this to me

THOMAS
My phone is dead do you have--

CHARLIE
PLEASE JUST READ IT TO ME

Thomas grabs the essay from Charlie

THOMAS

Okay okay--

(reading quickly)
“In the amazing book Moby Dick by
the author Herman Melville the
author recounts his story of being
at sea In the first part of his
book the author calling himself
Ishmael is in a small seaside town
and he is sharing a bed with a man
named Queequeg--” What is this why
am I reading this I need to--

CHARLIE
Just read it any of it

THOMAS

(reads)
“And I felt saddest of all when I
read the boring chapters that were
only descriptions of whales
because I knew the author was just
trying to save us from his own sad
story just for a little while”

Charlie’s breathing begins to return to normal The pain
slowly subsides

THOMAS (CONTD)
(reading)
“This book made me think about my
own life and then it made me feel
glad for my”
(MORE)
THOMAS (CONTD)
(pause)
Did that--help

Charlie takes a few deep breaths lies back on the couch He
grabs a towel wipes the sweat off his face

CHARLIE
Yes Yes it--

Pause

THOMAS
My phone is dead do you have a
phone I need to call an ambulance
You need help--

CHARLIE
I don’t go to hospitals

THOMAS
Look I can’t help you I don’t--

CHARLIE
I don’t go to hospitals
(pause)
Sorry You can go I’m sorry Thank
you for reading that to me

Charlie reaches for the essay Thomas gives it to him Thomas
eyes the door then turns back to Charlie

THOMAS
Are you sure you’re okay

Charlie looks at him a dawning realization that there is a
stranger in his home

CHARLIE
I’m sorry who are

Awkward silence Finally
THOMAS
(tentative)
Are you acquainted with the gospel
of Jesus Christ

Pause

CHARLIE
What
THOMAS
I’m sharing Christ’s message of
love and Um

CHARLIE
Oh
(looking away)
Look I should call my friend
She’s a nurse she--takes care of
me

Thomas nods anxiously heading toward the front door

THOMAS
Yeah of course Ill

CHARLIE
Wait my phone fell under there
can you--

Charlie points under the couch Thomas goes to the couch
bending down He reaches under the couch hesitating a bit
He finds the phone gives it to Charlie then moves toward
the front door again Just then Charlie has another pain in
his chest Thomas hesitates looking at him

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Listen I don’t know what’s gonna
happen in the next few minutes if
you don’t mind could you

Pause Thomas considers

THOMAS
Yeah of course

CHARLIE
Thank you

Charlie makes a call on his phone Thomas closes the front
door Charlie’s call goes to voicemail

LIZ (VO)
It’s Liz I’m not around please--

Charlie ends the call He starts to compose a text Pause

THOMAS
What was-- That thing you had me
read to you

CHARLIE
It’s an essay It’s my job I teach
online college courses
THOMAS
But why did you have me read it to
you

CHARLIE

Because I thought I was dying And
I wanted to hear it one last time

INT - LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY LATER 3

Charlie sits on the couch as before One sleeve of his shirt
is rolled up and LIZ a nurse in her 40s is taking his
blood pressure with an oversized cuff Thomas sits on a chair
in a corner trying not to look at Charlie

LIZ
You should have called an
ambulance

CHARLIE
With no health insurance

LIZ
Being in debt is better than being
dead What’s wrong with you Why is
there a missionary here

CHARLIE
(eyeing Liz)
Someone left the door unlocked

LIZ
I left after you fell asleep
earlier I must’ve forgotten Good
thing too If I hadn’t you might
have--

CHARLIE
Liz I don’t like it when you--

LIZ
Okay okay I just hate the thought
of you being sealed up in this
place when I’m not here Now shut
up I’m trying to

Charlie takes a deep breath sweat pouring down his face He
grabs a towel wipes his forehead

Liz listens for his blood pressure She reads the high
number Her eyes widen Charlie looks at her
CHARLIE
What

LIZ
Sh

Liz reads the lower number She looks at Charlie then takes
off the cuff

LIZ (CONTD)
Tell me what you felt

CHARLIE
Pain in my chest It was hard to
breathe I couldn’t intake air

LIZ
How are you sleeping

CHARLIE

Liz takes out a stethoscope threading it down the back of
Charlie’s shirt Charlie bends forward as best as he can Liz
listens to his breathing

LIZ
You’re wheezing

CHARLIE
I always wheeze Liz

LIZ
Youre wheezing more Deep breath

Charlie takes a deep breath He winces

LIZ (CONTD)

onto the couch

Another pause Charlie tries to reach for his walker but is
unable

CHARLIE
Could you-- I haven’t been to the
bathroom all day I’m ready to
explode
Liz hands Charlie his walker She holds it to the floor
putting all her weight on it allowing Charlie to brace

himself on the walker and stand up Liz heads to the bathroom
to prepare it for Charlie

INT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 3A
Liz makes her way into the bathroom tidying things up for
Charlie She looks in the mirror and takes a deep breath

steeling herself

She goes back into the living room

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 3B

Charlie slowly starts making his way down the hallway toward
the bathroom as Liz passes by him

LIZ
You need help in there

Thomas gets up tentatively looking down the hallway

CHARLIE
No I’m fine just-- Sorry

LIZ
What are you sorry about

CHARLIE
Sorry I don’t know Just--sorry

Charlie makes his way into the bathroom

Liz goes to the couch takes the bedsheet off of it

Liz eyes Thomas suspiciously Thomas forces a smile Awkward
pause

THOMAS
I should go

LIZ
Thank you For helping him

Thomas starts gathering his things about to head toward the
front door

LIZ (CONTD)
You must be from New Life

Liz opens a closet throws the dirty bedsheet into a hamper
and grabs a clean one Inside the closet is an entire
universe of medical supplies lotions clean towels
deodorants over-the-counter medications ointments etc

Thomas nods smiles slightly at her
LIZ (CONTD)
You know Doug from the church
council
Liz spreads the clean bedsheet over the couch
THOMAS

Oh yeah I think so I mean I’m
sort of new so I don’t--

LIZ
He’s my dad

THOMAS
He’s--

LIZ

Doug and Cindy adopted me when I

THOMAS
(brightening)
Oh that’s--that’s great I’ve never
seen you there but I’m sort of new
to the area so--

LIZ

I fucking hate New Life
THOMAS

Oh
LIZ

My dad forced me to go when I was a

kid It was awful growing up with

all that end times bullshit
(MORE)

LIZ (CONTD)
You’re young why the hell would
you want to believe that the world
is about to end

Liz finishes with the bedsheet Thomas considers wording his
answer very carefully

THOMAS
I believe that when Christ returns
it’s going to be--beautiful

Liz goes to the kitchen retrieving a pack of cigarettes and
an ashtray from on top of the fridge She then goes to a
window opens it She pulls out a cigarette and lights one
blowing smoke out of the window

LIZ
Look you can go I know Charlie
appreciates the help But if you’re
here to convert him--

THOMAS
We don’t “convert” people our
message is a message of hope for
people--

LIZ
--people of all faiths” I know
youre sweet But believe me he
doesn’t want to hear about New

Life
THOMAS
Why
LIZ
Because it’s caused him a lot of
pain
THOMAS
How
LIZ

It killed his boyfriend
Pause Thomas looks at her The sound of a toilet flushing
Liz looks away from Thomas Liz puts out her cigarette and
puts the ashtray and the pack of cigarettes back to their
place on top of the fridge

THOMAS
Youre saying that the church--

LIZ
Killed Charlie’s boyfriend yes
And I should add that New Life has
caused me a lot of pain in my life
So we don’t need you coming over
here especially not now not this

THOMAS
Why

LIZ
Because he’s probably not going to
be here next week

THOMAS
Where is he going

Charlie emerges from the hallway with his walker

CHARLIE
I’m sorry you had to come over
Liz

Liz shuts the window

LIZ
It’s okay

CHARLIE
And I’m sorry I always think I’m
dying

Liz goes to Charlie speaking to him as he heads back to the
couch

LIZ

and the arm of the couch he collapses down into a seated
position

Silence

CHARLIE

LIZ

CHARLIE

Liz collapses onto the recliner exasperated Charlie looks
at her Thomas takes a step toward Charlie

THOMAS
Did you still want to hear about
Christ’s message of love and--

LIZ
NO HE DOES NOT

THOMAS
Okay okay I’1ll go I

Thomas backs away heading toward the front door He stops
turns to Charlie

THOMAS (CONTD)
I still don’t understand why you

CHARLIE
It’s a really good essay

Liz stands moving toward Thomas Thomas hurries outside Liz
shuts the door behind him Liz turns to Charlie Pause

LIZ
You have to go to the hospital

CHARLIE
And rack up tens of thousands of
dollars of hospital bills that

LIZ

LIZ
You say you’re sorry one more time

Charlie

Silence

happen
CHARLIE

LIZ

Haven’t I been telling you--

CHARLIE

She finds the television remote turns on the television She
sits next to Charlie putting her head on his shoulder She
flips through the channels absent-mindedly She lands on a
news channel playing coverage of the 2016 Idaho primaries

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Liz

Silence apart from the television

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Liz

More silence

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Please

Liz pauses again then relents She gets up goes to the
kitchen She opens up a shopping bag takes out a large
bucket of gas station fried chicken She brings the bucket to
Charlie and gives it to him without looking him in the eye

She sits back down starts to flip channels

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Thank you

She flips another channel lands on an familiar episode of a
sitcom Charlie starts to eat the chicken

LIZ
Oh I’ve seen this one it’s good

Charlie continues to eat the chicken Liz watches television

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATE THAT NIGHT 4

Charlie is asleep in front of the television which plays a
late-night program The chicken bucket is full of bones

Charlie wakes up with a start He looks at the television
then at the bucket of chicken He searches for a piece of

chicken but the bones are licked clean Charlie grabs the
remote turning off the television

He notices the Moby Dick essay from earlier on an arm of the
couch not in its proper folder He wipes his fingers off
with a rag then takes the essay and reaches for its folder
He regards the essay for a moment smiling then gently puts
it back into the folder

CHARLIE
(softly to himself)
In the first part of his book the
author calling himself Ishmael is
in a small sea-side town and he is
sharing a bed with a man named
Queequeg

He lifts his shirt up pulling it off of his body He folds
the shirt neatly while he speaks

CHARLIE (CONTD)
The author and Queequeg go to
church and later set out on a ship
captained by the pirate named Ahab
who is missing a leg and very much
wants to kill the whale which is
named Moby Dick and which is
white

Charlie reaches for his walker Charlie braces himself on the
walker and stands up

INT - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 5

Charlie shirtless moves down the hallway with his walker
breathing heavily

CHARLIE
In the course of the book the
pirate Ahab encounters many
hardships His entire life is set
around trying to kill a certain
whale I think this is sad because
the whale doesn’t have any
emotions and doesn’t know how bad
Ahab wants to kill him He’s just a
poor big animal

He opens his bedroom door

INT - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 6

A stained uncovered king-sized mattress rests on top of a
sheet of plywood laid over several cinder blocks in a room
that feels more like a converted office than a bedroom The
mattress is surrounded by empty food containers and empty and
half-full two liter soda bottles Charlie moves toward the
bed

CHARLIE
And I feel bad for Ahab as well
because he thinks that his life
will be better if he can kill this
whale but in reality it won’t help
him at all

Bracing himself on the walker Charlie manages to lower
himself down onto the mattress slowly His knees and chest
ache as he descends

He reaches for a bottle of soda on his nightstand He opens
it takes a long drink
6A

Finally he is able to lay flat on the mattress He stares up
to the ceiling wheezing taking a few deep breaths

Charlie puts the soda bottle on the floor He closes his
eyes listening to the sound of his heart beating struggling
to pump blood throughout his body

CHARLIE (CONTD)
This book made me think about my
own life This book made me think
about my own life This book made

me-—

INT - KITCHEN - LATE MORNING 8

Charlie is in the kitchen leaning up against the counter
His walker is within reach he is reading through some essays
on his laptop He is just finishing up a small bowl of plain
oatmeal He takes one last bite then puts the bowl and spoon
down onto the counter

Just then he catches a glimpse of an old stash of candy bars
hidden in the back of a half-open drawer He opens the
drawer takes out one of the candy bars He opens it up
looking at it

After a moment he quickly wraps the candy back up puts it
back into the drawer and closes it

He thinks for a moment then goes to his laptop

Charlie types “congestive heart failure” into a search
engine

He scans an article His heart rate begins to increase

He types in another search “congestive heart failure obesity
prognosis”

He scans a few more results His pulse is faster still

Finally he types “BP 238134”
8A

11A

He scans a few results They are even more dire than he
expected He glances at a few of them then slams the
computer shut breathing in and out

Charlie quickly opens up the candy drawer and grabs the candy
bar from moments before He eats the entire thing in three
large quick bites

He hastily grabs a handful of candy bars opening a few
eating them too quickly

After a few moments he hears a soft cooing coming from the
window He just barely gets a glimpse of a robin flying away
from the window

Charlie swallows what’s in his mouth taking a big breath He
sighs then puts the uneaten candy bars back on the counter

He thinks for a moment then makes a decision He pulls out
his phone He looks at it for a moment then makes a call He
puts the phone to his ear as he smooths out his hair
anxious

OMITTED 8A

INT - BATHROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER 9
Charlie is in the shower Water streams from the shower head
and Charlie uses a loofah to wash his body

INT - BATHROOM - A SHORT TIME LATER 10

Charlie leaning on the sink for support with one arm shaves
with a disposable razor

Charlie nicks himself slightly He winces He keeps going

OMITTED 11

INT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 11A

Well-dressed and refreshed Charlie is at the window where he
saw the bird before He opens it up There is a plate sitting
on the ledge Charlie opens his hand placing several small
pieces of apple onto the plate He shuts the window It’s
obvious this has become a ritual for him

Just then a knock at the door Charlie looks

INT - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 12

ELLIE 17 holding a backpack stands near the front door
looking at Charlie who is lowering himself onto the couch
from his walker

ELLIE
Does this mean I’m gonna get fat

Pause

CHARLIE
No it doesn’t I was always big
but I just--let it get out of
control

Ellie scans the room

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Was your mom okay with you coming
over here

ELLIE
I didn’t tell her

Charlie shifts a little on the couch uncomfortable He takes
a breath Ellie watches him

CHARLIE
It’s really good to see you you

ELLIE
You actually care

CHARLIE
Of course I care I pester your
mom for information as often as

So why aren’t Don’t you have
school

ELLIE
Got suspended this morning

CHARLIE
Oh Why

ELLIE
I posted something about my stupid
bitch lab partner that the vice-
principal said was “vaguely
threatening”

Ellie moves inside a little more eyeing the room She keeps
her distance from Charlie

CHARLIE
You don’t like school
ELLIE
Only idiots like high school
CHARLIE
But--you’re on track to graduate
right
ELLIE

Counselor says I might not I’m not
worried I’m a smart person I
never forget anything But high
school is just bullshit

CHARLIE
Ellie it’s important if you don’t
graduate--

ELLIE

Are you actually trying to parent
me right now

CHARLIE
No I I’m sorry I just

Charlie looks at Ellie mounting concern Ellie wanders into
the kitchen

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I thought we could spend some time
with each other

ELLIE
I’m not spending time with you
Youre disgusting

CHARLIE
I know I I’m a lot bigger since
the last time you saw me--

ELLIE
I’m not talking about what you look
like

(MORE )

ELLIE (CONTD)
Youd be disgusting even if you
weren’t this fat you’d still be
that piece of shit dad who walked
out on me when I was eight All
because he wanted to fuck one of
his students Can I have one of
these

Ellie points to a box of doughnuts in the kitchen Pause
Charlie nods

Ellie takes a doughnut She comes out of the kitchen
nibbling on the doughnut

Charlie looks at her thinking Pause
CHARLIE
Look it’s been a long time I just
thought maybe we could--get to know
each other

Ellie chortles

ELLIE
I don’t even know why I’m here

She moves toward the front door about to leave

CHARLIE
I can pay you

She stops turns and looks at him

ELLIE
You want to pay me to spend time
with you

CHARLIE
And I can help you with your work
It’s what I do for my job

Charlie grabs his laptop opens it up His web browser is
open to an online university message board for one of his
courses He shows it to Ellie

Ellie glances at the screen

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I can help you pass your classes

ELLIE
You teach online
CHARLIE
Yes

ELLIE
Your students know what you look
like

Charlie closes the laptop

CHARLIE
I--keep the camera shut off

ELLIE
That’s probably a good idea

Ellie considers for a moment then opens up her backpack

rummages through it looking for something

ELLIE (CONTD)
If I show a lot of improvement in
one subject my counselor says I
might be able to graduate You can
rewrite these essays for English
But they have to be really good

She

Ellie takes a couple of essays out of her backpack hands

them to Charlie Charlie takes them looks at them

CHARLIE
I don’t know if I should write them
for you I can work with you on--

ELLIE
How much can you pay me

Pause
CHARLIE
Everything I have all the money I

have in the bank

ELLIE
How much

Ellie stares at him Pause Charlie relents
CHARLIE
A hundred-and-twenty thousand
Something like that I’d have to
check

Pause Ellie looks doubtful
Pause

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I never go out all I pay for is
food internet rent And I work
all the time

ELLIE
And you’d give all that to me Not
to my mom to me

CHARLIE
Yes just-- Don’t tell your mom
okay
(pause)
And maybe you could do some
writing Just for me

ELLIE
Why

CHARLIE
You’re a smart person I bet you’re
a strong writer Plus Ima
teacher I wanna make sure you’re
getting something out of this

ELLIE
I don’t even understand you

Ellie heads for the front door opening it up She stops
thinking for a moment Very faintly we begin to hear the
sound of ocean waves in the background She turns facing

Charlie

ELLIE (CONTD)
Stand up and walk over to me

CHARLIE
What

ELLIE
Come over here Walk toward me

Charlie pauses then reaches for his walker

ELLIE (CONTD)
Without that thing Just stand up
and come over here

CHARLIE
Ellie I can’t really--

ELLIE
Shut up Come over here

Pause Charlie looks around trying to find something to
brace himself Finally he puts one hand on the arm of the
couch He struggles to roll forward so he can put his weight
onto his legs Ellie watches him silently

The effort of bending forward is painful but he doesn’t
stop He is almost able to get on his feet but a surge of
pain brings him back to the couch

He looks at Ellie She stares back at him motionless

He grabs the edge of an end table bracing himself He puts
all his effort into it and manages to rise a few inches off
the couch He keeps his eyes locked on Ellie

Just as it looks like he might be able to freely stand the
end table gives way two of the legs cracking in half It
takes a lamp with it along with a stack of papers

Charlie falls back onto the couch He rolls back dizzy with
pain and lack of oxygen

Charlie breathes for a moment managing to calm himself down

He opens his eyes then looks back at Ellie as she rushes out
the front door

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 13
Charlie stands with his walker by a bookcase near the dining
table one of Ellie’s essays in his hand He reaches up and
takes out a well-loved copy of Leaves of Grass

A knock at the door

DELIVERY BOY (0S)

DELIVERY BOY (0S)

CHARLIE
Yeah I’m fine

Charlie starts moving toward the front door He drops off
Ellie’s essay on the kitchen counter

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Thank you

Pause Charlie listens Finally we hear the sound of the
mailbox opening and shutting We see the silhouette of the
DELIVERY BOY passing by the kitchen windows Charlie waits
for a moment then moves toward the door with his walker

INT - FRONT DOORWAY - MOMENTS LATER 14

Charlie opens up the front door We now see that his
apartment is on the second floor of a cheaply constructed
building his front door opening to an exterior walkway and
staircase that lead down to the parking lot

There is a large pizza box sitting on a small outdoor table
next to the door We hear the sound of a car door shutting

Charlie looks down to the parking lot sees the delivery boy
driving away He watches the car leave the parking lot and
disappear down the street

INT - LIVING ROOM - THAT EVENING 15

Charlie sits on the couch Liz sits next to him holding a
small machine with some electrodes attached to it As Charlie
breathes in and out we see that the electrodes are attached
to Charlie’s palm

LIZ
Breathe slowly relax

Liz watches the number on the machine Silence She breathes
in and out Charlie does as well

LIZ (CONTD)
It measures perspiration it’s an
indicator of stress It’s about
establishing a relationship between
your brain and your body If you
know how to make yourself calm
then your blood pressure’ll
Here

Liz shows him the number on the machine which is going down
slowly

CHARLIE
I don’t need a little machine to
tell me how to take a few deep
breaths and stop sweating

LIZ
Well apparently you fucking do
Take another deep breath

Liz puts the machine in Charlie’s lap and goes to the
kitchen She starts to unpack the groceries she just brought
over

LIZ (CONTD)
Were just gonna try some different
methods or whatever if you refuse
to go to the hospital then you--

Liz sees Ellie’s essays sitting on the counter She picks one
up notices Ellie’s name at the top She takes the essay and
leaves the kitchen showing it to Charlie

LIZ (CONTD)
Where did this come from

Pause Charlie looks away

LIZ (CONTD)
Was she here

Charlie looks at Liz apologetic
LIZ (CONTD)
No I don’t like this This isn’t a

good idea

Pause Liz goes back to the kitchen She continues to stock
items

LIZ (CONTD)
You know you’re not supposed to be
around her Does her mom know about
this

CHARLIE
I just want to see her I’ve always
just wanted to see her Mary’s kept
her from me all this time--

LIZ
Why do you suddenly need to see her
so bad why now

CHARLIE
Liz

Charlie looks at her Pause Liz looks away
LIZ
Why the hell do you have her

homework anyway

Liz goes back to putting away groceries in the kitchen

CHARLIE
Look I wasn’t planning on this
but she just-- She needs some help

in school so I’m just going to
help her with some essays

LIZ
You haven’t seen this girl since
she was eight years old and you
wanna reconnect with her by doing
her homework for her

CHARLIE
It’s fine--

LIZ
It’s not fine She shouldn’t be
around you when you’re like this
What if something happens what if
you need help

Liz notices the number on the machine which is slowly going
back up

LIZ (CONTD)
Charlie calm down

Frustrated Charlie takes the electrodes off puts the
machine on the couch next to him

Liz glares at him then grabs the machine and puts it in her
bag

CHARLIE
I’m worried about her

LIZ
Why

Charlie opens up his laptop it’s open to Ellie’s Facebook
page

LIZ (CONTD)
Youre spying on her now

CHARLIE
It doesn’t even look like she has
friends I don’t think she’s

Liz joins him on the couch He scrolls through her profile
landing on one black and white shot of a barren suburban
street at night several streetlights trailing off into the
distance throwing pools of light onto the street It’s
strikingly beautiful if bleak He continues to scroll
landing on a selfie The photo has one comment “dyke”
Charlie stares at it

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I’m worried she’s forgotten what an
amazing person she is

Charlie and Liz look at the photo for a moment Liz looks at
Charlie then shuts the laptop

LIZ
She’s just a teenager everyone’s
insane when they’re a teenager
When I was that age when my dad
would really piss me off I’m just
lucky I didn’t get arrested I1l
say that much

Liz goes back into the kitchen putting the rest of the
groceries away

LIZ (CONTD)
Point is bringing her over here is
a bad idea

Liz grabs a meatball sub brings it to Charlie Charlie shuts
the laptop Liz looks straight into his eyes

LIZ (CONTD)
You’ve got enough to deal with
right now you hear me Do not
bring her over here again

Charlie looks at the meatball sub in Liz’s hand Liz
continues to stare at him

CHARLIE
Okay

Liz hands Charlie the meatball sub then heads back into the
kitchen Charlie unwraps the sub and begins eating it fairly
quickly

LIZ
It’s not like she’s alone you
know She has her mom

Charlie takes a big bite of the sub accidentally inhaling a
large chunk of meat His windpipe is blocked

Liz has her back turned to him She turns on the water
starts to wash dishes that have piled up in the sink She
sees the digital clock on the microwave

LIZ (CONTD)
Shit I have to go soon I hate
these night shifts Just a steady
parade of dumb drunk college kids

Charlie begins to panic He reaches into his mouth trying to
pull out the piece of meat It doesn’t work

LIZ (CONTD)
Did I tell you about this girl from
a few nights ago The puke was
bright purple I swear What does
that Why can’t these kids just
drink beer

No response Charlie continues to choke

LIZ (CONTD)
Charlie

Liz finally turns around sees Charlie She goes to him
LIZ (CONTD)
Are you choking Oh God are you

choking

Liz not knowing what to do pushes Charlie forward She hits
his back a couple of times it doesn’t work

LIZ (CONTD)
Okay okay--lean over the arm

Liz helps Charlie move so that the base of his stomach is
over the arm of the couch She circles the couch climbs on
top of him Putting all her weight into it she attempts to
give him the Heimlich Maneuver

The first few attempts don’t work but finally on the third
or fourth attempt Charlie spits out the chunk of meatball
onto the carpet

LIZ (CONTD)
Shit Oh shit Charlie

Charlie leans back on the couch in an immense amount of
pain He takes a few deep breaths

CHARLIE
I’m okay I’m okay

Silence Charlie breathes Liz stares at him The water
continues to run in the kitchen sink

LIZ
GODDAMMIT CHARLIE WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU Chew your food like a
normal human being You could have
just died right in front of me you-

-

CHARLIE
I’m sorry

Silence Liz looks away struggles to calm down

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I’m sorry Liz

Finally she goes to the kitchen grabs a wad of paper
towels She goes back to the couch cleaning up the piece of
meatball that Charlie coughed up

Liz throws away the paper towels then goes back to Charlie
She sees the partially eaten sub on the floor She considers
then picks it up looking at it

LIZ
It’s okay

Liz brushes it off a bit then extends it to Charlie Charlie
looks at it then her He takes the sub Liz looks away
going into the kitchen She turns off the water
15A

She pauses taking a breath gathering herself
Charlie looks at the meatball sub

CUT TO

TITLE WEDNESDAY 15A

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATE MORNING 16

Charlie on the couch is in front of his laptop with the
virtual classroom on the screen this time with a different
group of STUDENTS As before his camera is not on

CHARLIE

I read through some of the posts on
the course discussion forum this
morning In particular a post about
crafting a good thesis Quote
“just pick a sentence from the
reading and say it’s good or some
shit”

(pause sighing)
Listen at this point in the
course I’ve given you all I can in
terms of structure building a
thesis paragraph organization
But if all of that isn’t built on
your own original ideas and
truthful analysis it doesn’t mean
anything So just--as you write and
revise focus on that Focus on the
truth of your argument It may
sound silly but it’s--important I
promise it’s important

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER 17

Leaning on his walker Charlie is at a bookcase leafing
through several old notebooks on the shelf Most of them are
old and well-worn

Finally he spots what he was looking for a blank notebook
with a purple cover He grabs it taking it off the shelf

As he pulls it out he notices something on the shelf nearby
an old framed photo wedged between a couple of books He
pulls the photo out looking at it

The photo is roughly six or seven years old it’s a picture
of Charlie in his early 40s standing on a beach on the Oregon
Coast his arm around a slightly younger man They both look
young healthy and happy Charlie is big but not nearly as
large as he is now

Charlie stares at the photo smiling a bit

OMITTED 18

INT - HALLWAY - SHORTLY LATER 19

Charlie stands with his walker at the closed door to the
second bedroom There is an old dust-covered key laying flat
on top of the doorframe

Using his claw Charlie tries to grab the key He struggles
to get the right angle and lifting his arms this high proves
difficult Just as he’s about to get hold of the key it
slips from the claw’s grip and falls to the floor

Charlie tries to use the claw to grab the key He manages to

grip the key momentarily but as he’s lifting it he loses his
grip and the key falls back to the floor bouncing underneath
the washing machine in an adjacent closet

He sighs looking at the locked door

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER 20

Ellie sits in a corner typing on her phone Charlie is on
the couch reading an essay He steals a few glances at Ellie

CHARLIE
This is You say here that Walt
Whitman wrote “Song for Myself”

ELLIE
(not looking up)
Yeah

CHARLIE
It’s called “Song of Myself”

ELLIE
My title’s better

Pause
CHARLIE
Yeah well it Okay I’11 just
change it

Charlie makes a note in the essay

CHARLIE (CONTD)
(reading)
“The poem ‘Song of Myself’ is ina
book called ‘Leaves of Grass’ It
was written by Walt Whitman and was
published in 1855 He paid for the
first publication himself”

ELLIE
You don’t have to read it out loud
just re-write it

He looks at Ellie She continues to type on her phone

CHARLIE
But this You’re supposed to
analyze the poem this is just a
list of facts

ELLIE
Yup Thank you Wikipedia

CHARLIE
It’s actually an amazing poem
Whitman uses the metaphor of “I”
not to refer to himself but to
explode the entire definition of
self in favor of this all-
encompassing--

ELLIE
I really really don’t care

Pause Ellie continues to type not looking at Charlie

CHARLIE
You know I think you might like it
if you actually read it

Ellie finally looks up from her phone looks at Charlie

ELLIE
Youre just like my teachers you
think just because I’m not losing
my shit over the poem it’s because
I didn’t read it I did read it
(MORE)

ELLIE (CONTD)
It’s overwritten and dumb and
repetitive and even though he
thinks his “metaphor of I” is deep
it’s actually just bullshit and in
reality he’s just some worthless
19th century faggot

Pause Ellie stares at him for a moment

CHARLIE
That’s an interesting perspective
It would make for an interesting
essay

Ellie goes back to her phone

ELLIE
Just write that thing about
exploding the definition of self
my English teacher’1l love it

Charlie looks at the essay again reads a few more sentences
His eyes drift back to Ellie

Charlie puts his hand on the edge of the couch nervously
teasing a loose thread

CHARLIE
How’s your mom doing

ELLIE
Oh my God

Ellie grabs her backpack stands up

ELLIE (CONTD)
If you’re not gonna write these
essays for me--

CHARLIE
Ellie I don’t need you here to
write this for you If you want to
go you can go You can still have
the money

Pause
ELLIE
I thought you wanted to get to know
me
CHARLIE

I do but I don’t want to force you
to be here It’s up to you
Pause Ellie considers After a moment

down and sits

Pause

Pause Ellie gets up starts wandering around the room

ELLIE
She’s fine Mom I guess

CHARLIE
Is she--happy

ELLIE
When she drinks
CHARLIE
Oh
(pause)

You guys still live in that duplex
over on Orchard

ELLIE
You don’t even know where we live
(short pause)
You don’t stay in touch with mom

CHARLIE
I check in as much as she lets me
She really only tells me things
about you

ELLIE
Why

CHARLIE
Because that’s all I ask about

examining things

ELLIE
When I was eleven we moved to the
other side of town near the
Walmart

CHARLIE
Is your mother--with anyone right
now

ELLIE
No Why you interested

CHARLIE
Oh no I just

she puts her backpack

Ellie looks at a bookshelf spots the framed photo of Alan
and Charlie from before She turns it right side up
examining it

ELLIE
Why did you gain all that weight

Ellie takes the framed photo in her hands studying it

CHARLIE
Oh I don’t--

ELLIE
If you’re gonna interrogate me I’m
gonna do the same thing Why did
you gain all that weight

Pause
CHARLIE
Someone close to me passed away
and it-- It had an effect on me

Ellie turns to Charlie holds up the framed photo Charlie
looks at the photo nodding slightly

Charlie continues to play with the loose thread on the couch
his heartbeat rising a bit

Ellie looks at the photo again

ELLIE
Your boyfriend

CHARLIE
My partner

ELLIE
Your student

CHARLIE
He wasn’t that young it was a
night school course--

ELLIE
Oh I remember him You had him
over for dinner once when mom was
in Montana visiting grandma You
made steaks The good kind Better
meal than you ever made me or mom
I remember hearing the two of you
talking after I went to bed
Pause

Pause

Ellie
where
seat

CHARLIE
How do you remember all that

ELLIE
I told you I never forget
anything

Ellie stares at Charlie

ELLIE (CONTD)
How did he die

CHARLIE
You know I-- I’d really rather
not talk about this right now if
that’s alright

rolls her eyes puts the framed photo near the window
the bird had been facing out She goes back to her
takes out her phone again

Charlie reaches behind the couch takes out the purple
notebook

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I’1l write these essays for you
but I’d like you to do some
writing just for me

Charlie extends the notebook to Ellie She looks up from her
phone doesn’t take the notebook

ELLIE
I hate writing essays

CHARLIE
Just think about the poem for a
while and write something Be
honest tell me what you really

think

ELLIE
You want me to write what I really
think

Charlie keeps the notebook extended toward Ellie Ellie
stares at him for a second then grabs the notebook She

opens

it up grabs a pen starts writing

Charlie reaches for his walker

CHARLIE
I’1l be back in a minute Just
write whatever you want

Charlie manages to brace himself on the walker and stand up
He slowly heads down the hall toward the bathroom Ellie
continues to write in the notebook watching him from the
corner of her eye

Charlie continues down the hall into the bathroom

INT - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 21

Charlie makes his way into the bathroom He turns on the
water

Leaning on the sink he fights a wave of tears

The wave of tears comes back nearly overtaking him He
stifles it as best he can

ELLIE (0S)
Are you okay
(short pause)
Unless you’re dying there’s no way
I’m coming in there

CHARLIE
No it’s I’m fine

Charlie breathes in and out struggling to calm down

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 22

Ellie is standing halfway down the hall holding the
notebook She looks toward the bathroom silently

Suddenly we hear the sound of flapping wings near the window
Ellie looks and sees the bird from before

Ellie approaches the window sees the plate with pieces of
apple on it Only a few slightly brown pieces remain

A knock at the front door Ellie looks toward the front door
then toward the bathroom considering calling out for
Charlie

Another knock

Finally she goes to the front door unlocking the two bolts
and throwing it open Thomas stands in the doorway

THOMAS
Oh uh Hi
Ellie doesn’t respond staring at him silently

THOMAS (CONTD)
I was--looking for Charlie

ELLIE
He’s in the bathroom

THOMAS
Oh I can come back if--

Ellie beckons him inside

Thomas pauses then cautiously makes his way inside Ellie
shuts the door behind him takes a seat stares at him
Thomas awkwardly smiles at her

Pause

THOMAS (CONTD)
Are you his--friend

ELLIE
I’m his daughter

THOMAS
(taken aback)
Oh

ELLIE
Are you surprised

THOMAS
Well yeah I guess

ELLIE
What’s more surprising That a gay
guy has a daughter or that someone
found his penis
Pause Thomas makes a move toward the front door

ELLIE (CONTD)
I’m kidding Jesus

Thomas stops looks at her

An awkward silence

THOMAS
I uh Charlie was interested in
hearing more about my church I
brought some literature and I
thought that--

ELLIE
Are you like a Mormon

THOMAS
No I uh--I’m from New Life

ELLIE
Ohhh That end times cult thing

THOMAS
It’s not a cult--

ELLIE
I’1l tell you one thing I like
about religion

Thomas looks at her unsure of how to respond He gives her a
slight smile a slight shrug

ELLIE (CONTD)
What I like about religion is that
it assumes everyone is an idiot and
that they’re incapable of saving
themselves I think they got
something right with that

THOMAS
Well I don’t really--

ELLIE
But what I don’t like about
religion is that when people accept
Jesus or whatever they suddenly
think they’re better than everyone
else That by accepting the fact
that they’re stupid sinners they’ve
somehow become better and they
turn into assholes

Ellie stares at Thomas Pause
THOMAS
I--don’t really know what to say I

have some pamphlets--

Ellie takes out her phone snaps a picture of Thomas

THOMAS (CONTD)
Why did you just do that

ELLIE

Are you coming back tomorrow

THOMAS
I’m not sure

ELLIE

Come back tomorrow I’1ll be here

around the same time

THOMAS

I’m sorry what’s happening

Charlie appears in the hallway he sees Thomas

CHARLIE
Oh

THOMAS
Hi um I was just--

Ellie takes a picture of Charlie with her phone then grabs
her backpack starts gathering her things She leaves the

notebook behind

ELLIE
(to Charlie)

You’ll have that one done by

tomorrow

CHARLIE
Sure

ELLIE
Five page minimum

CHARLIE

It’ll be good I promise

Ellie turns to Thomas

ELLIE
I’m Ellie

Pause

THOMAS
Thomas

Pause Ellie studies him Thomas
Finally Ellie leaves

smiles at her awkwardly

Charlie notices the framed photo of himself and his partner
on the shelf looks at it briefly He reaches up and turns it
over putting it face down

THOMAS (CONTD)
So

Charlie turns to Thomas Thomas looks back at him smiling

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER 23

Charlie is on the couch looking through some Bible tracts
absent-mindedly Thomas holds a Bible

THOMAS
Christ’s return has been promised
for centuries But there are a lot
of clues in scripture that suggest
it’s imminent

Charlie turns a page in the tract There is an illustration
of hundreds of people floating up to heaven from out of a
hellish city landscape

Charlie flips a page the phrase “THE END IS COMING” appears
in bold letters

THOMAS (CONTD)
So that means that we don’t have
time to deny the gospel we don’t
have the luxury of--

CHARLIE
You really think the world is gonna
end soon

Pause Thomas looks at Charlie

THOMAS
I mean The Bible says that no
one shall know the day or the hour
but--yeah I think we’re probably
living in end times

CHARLIE
And that doesn’t Bother you

Charlie flips another page in the pamphlet There is an
illustration of a thoroughly Caucasian Jesus his arms open
wide

THOMAS
No it-- I think it’s amazing
it’s

Charlie turns to Thomas Thomas thinks looking at his hands

THOMAS (CONTD)
The idea that there’s a better
world coming to replace this one
That all the terrible things about
this country this planet will
just get wiped clean replaced with
something pure and holy and--

CHARLIE
Look I-- I’m sorry I don’t mean
to be rude but I know all this

THOMAS
What do you mean

CHARLIE
I’ve probably read just about
everything written by New Life
Church probably every pamphlet
they’ve ever published--

THOMAS
Oh--I mean that’s great and
everything but these tracts are
just the beginning there’s so much
in the Bible that--

CHARLIE
I’ve read the Bible

Pause Thomas looks at him smiling

THOMAS
Oh yeah

CHARLIE
Sure Couple times

THOMAS
Did you Like it

Pause

CHARLIE
I thought it was Devastating
God creates us expels us from
paradise then we wander around for
thousands of years killing each
other before he comes back to save
144000 of us meanwhile the other
seven and a half billion of us fall
into hell

Pause Thomas considers thumbs through his Bible a bit

THOMAS
Yeah that’s not really how I
interpret it but

Finally Thomas sighs puts down the Bible He sits next to
Charlie

THOMAS (CONTD)

Charlie you have to understand--
God hasn’t turned his back on you
If you accept him he’s going to
release you from this he’s going
to take your soul out of this body
and give you a new body one made
of pure light Don’t you want that

Charlie sighs looking away from him

CHARLIE
I’m not interested in being saved
I appreciate you helping me out the
other day but you can go this
doesn’t--

THOMAS

Okay look--I really think God sent
me here for a reason there’s a
reason I knocked on your door when
you needed someone the most

(short pause)
Isn’t there any way I can help
That’s why I became a missionary in
the first place right

Pause Charlie looks at him

CHARLIE
There is--something you can do

Charlie looks at Thomas Thomas suddenly grows uncomfortable
moving away from Charlie

CHARLIE (CONTD)
What

THOMAS
No I just I hope you know I
wasn’t talking about

CHARLIE
What
(finally realizing)
Oh my God

THOMAS
It’s just with the What you were
watching the first time I came in
here--

CHARLIE
I am not attracted to you Please
understand me when I say that I am
not attracted to you You’re a
fetus

Thomas looks away a little ashamed

THOMAS
Sorry I just

CHARLIE
Thomas tell me the truth Do you
find me disgusting

Pause Thomas looks Charlie straight in the eye

THOMAS
No
(pause)
I just want to help Please just
let me help

Charlie looks at him thinking

INT - HALLWAY - A SHORT TIME LATER 24

Charlie and Thomas are in the hallway Charlie is standing
with his walker Thomas is on his knees searching for the
key underneath the washing machine He finds it then stands
up He looks at the key for a moment then puts it in the
bedroom door unlocking it

Just as he’s about to open the door Charlie reaches out and
stops him leaving the door open only a few inches Thomas
looks at Charlie Charlie looks away

Charlie starts making his way back to the living room

CHARLIE
Thank you that was-- That was
helpful

THOMAS

What happened to your

Charlie stops looking at Thomas

THOMAS (CONTD)

Charlie makes his way down the hallway Thomas watches him

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 25
Charlie comes into the living room followed by Thomas

Liz is coming in through the front door pulling a folded up
wheelchair behind her

LIZ
Alright I got you this I did some
asking around and--

Liz sees Thomas

LIZ (CONTD)
What the fuck is he doing here

CHARLIE
He was just helping me with
something Liz Take it easy

Liz glares at Thomas then pulls the wheelchair the rest of
the way through the doorway

LIZ
Okay well You can go now

CHARLIE

LIZ
(to Thomas )
Go home

Thomas grabs his backpack moves toward the front door He
knocks over a floor lamp in his haste

THOMAS
Crap sorry--

LIZ

Thomas bends down grabs the lamp

LIZ (CONTD)
I said leave it

CHARLIE
Liz would you stop

Liz glares at Charlie Thomas awkwardly puts the lamp right
side up then goes to the front door He opens it about to
leave

Liz goes to Thomas blocking him She shuts the front door
glaring at him

LIZ
Actually stay We’ll have a chat

Liz locks the two bolts on the door then brings the
wheelchair to Charlie Thomas stands near the front door not
knowing what to do

CHARLIE
What is it

LIZ
What the fuck does it look like

Liz unfolds the wheelchair

LIZ (CONTD)
It’s a fat guy wheelchair

CHARLIE
Why do I need a wheelchair

LIZ
I was talking with one of the ER
doctors he said that moderate
activity would be a good idea
Sense of independence might help

you out

CHARLIE
How much did you pay for this
thing

LIZ

Nothing We ordered it for a
patient a few months ago it’s just
been sitting around

CHARLIE
What happened to the patient

Liz doesn’t respond

LIZ
Try it out

Liz braces the back of the wheelchair by putting all her
weight onto it

Charlie slowly backs toward the wheelchair
LIZ (CONTD)
(like a truck backing up)
Beep Beep Beep

Charlie looks back at her Liz smiles

Charlie keeps moving backward reaching the wheelchair He
collapses down into it Thomas watches silently

Liz unlocks the wheels of the wheelchair moves some trash
and other items out of his way

Charlie wheels himself forward a little bit using both his
arms and his legs to help himself move Charlie smiles a bit
unexpectedly pleased

LIZ (CONTD)

Good

CHARLIE
Yeah it--it’s actually really
nice

LIZ

Lemme clear some space for you

Liz starts moving some stuff around making room for the
wheelchair She goes to one end of the coffee table about to
lift it She pauses looking at Thomas

LIZ (CONTD)
Hello

Thomas quickly moves to the other side of the coffee table
He helps Liz move it to the side

Charlie wheels himself a few more feet He smiles wider

CHARLIE
Thank you Liz this is really
great

LIZ

See I told you

THOMAS
I should probably go

LIZ
Not before we have our little chat

THOMAS
Oh I--what

Liz grabs her cigarettes and ashtray from on top of the
fridge then indicates the front door

LIZ
Cmon
CHARLIE
Liz--
LIZ
(to Charlie)

Just gimme a minute with him

Liz unbolts both locks on the door opens it and gestures for
Thomas to meet her outside

Thomas unsure of what to do moves outside as Liz has
indicated Liz follows him giving Charlie a look as she does
so She shuts the apartment door

Charlie is left alone He slowly rolls himself toward the
kitchen looking through the shuttered windows

EXT - APARTMENT FRONT DOOR - MOMENTS LATER 26

Thomas awkwardly stands as Liz grabs a lawn chair and sits
She pulls out a cigarette and lights it Liz signals for
Thomas to sit on a nearby bench A silence as she looks him
over

LIZ
Where you from

THOMAS
What

LIZ

You said you’ve only been here for
a little while Where you from

THOMAS
Uh--Iowa Town called Waterloo

LIZ
You asking me

THOMAS
No I-- I’m from Waterloo

LIZ
Your whole family move out here for
New Life

Pause Thomas tenses up a bit

THOMAS
No I-- It’s just me I wanted to
do some missionary work before
school

LIZ
You’re from Iowa and you came to
Idaho to do missionary work Why
aren’t you in Africa or something

THOMAS
Idaho needs the word just as much
as anyone else

Liz takes a long drag of her cigarette

LIZ
Okay listen I know this is fun for
you You get to travel around act
superior than everyone else and
eventually you go home get some
boring job have too many kids
(MORE )

LIZ (CONTD)
It all sounds great it’s God’s
plan But there are other types of
people People like Charlie for
whom this amazing plan doesn’t fit
So just stay away from him He
doesn’t need this right now

THOMAS
I disagree

Liz looks at him She stubs out her half-smoked cigarette on
the sole of her shoe putting it back in the pack

LIZ
Excuse me

THOMAS
Sorry I just-- He’s refusing to
go to the hospital he’s dying
What he needs is spiritual
guidance

She moves toward Thomas

LIZ
And youre gonna give him that

THOMAS
No God will

LIZ
I see

Pause Liz stares at him

LIZ (CONTD)
My big brother did some missionary
work for New Life Went to South
America

THOMAS
Oh

LIZ
Yeah I was the black sheep I
refused to go to church ever since
I was twelve Dad knew I was a lost
cause But not my brother he loved
New Life

(pause)
(MORE )

LIZ (CONTD)
He wrote me a letter a few months
after he left told me he was tired
and lonely but he didn’t want to
come home because he didn’t want to
get married

THOMAS
He didn’t want to--

LIZ

Dad had set it all up pushed him
into getting married to this girl
from the church he barely knew But
when he came back--he met someone
else Fell in love started a whole
new life And dad kicked him out of
the church And--the family

Liz leans into Thomas growing angry Thomas grows more and
more nervous

LIZ (CONTD)

I thought he was gonna be able to
get over all that religious stuff
but it was like a cancer he
couldn’t shake it He just--caved
in on himself stopped sleeping
stopped eating Lost a ton of
weight One night Charlie came
home and he wasn’t here Couple
weeks later a guy was out jogging
on a bike path near the river in
Lewiston saw something washed up
on shore and

(pause)
That was Alan The love of
Charlie’s life and my brother

Pause Thomas finally realizes

THOMAS
Oh
LIZ
Yeah Oh
(pause)

To this day my dad won’t admit it
Told the whole congregation Alan’s
death was an “unfortunate

accident” Denying him to the end

Pause Thomas takes this in

THOMAS
I just I know you don’t trust
me and I haven’t known him for
very long But I really think God
has brought me here right when
Charlie needs it most I just want
him to be saved that’s all--

This triggers something in Liz She bears down on him

LIZ
You listen to me He doesn’t need
“saving” In a few days he’s
probably going to be dead so what
he needs is for you to leave him
alone I am the only one who can
help him you understand me

CHARLIE (0S)
Liz

Liz turns around Charlie is behind her in his wheelchair in
the open doorway staring at her

Thomas quickly leaves

turns on the television flips through a few channels

LIZ
You wanna watch some Maury That
sounds good right

Liz finds the right channel puts the remote down She
watches the television for a few moments still standing
Charlie remains motionless Liz doesn’t look at him

LIZ (CONTD)
Actually I got another night shift
tonight I better uh
(pause)
You good for the night

Pause Charlie nods slightly Liz still doesn’t look at him

After a moment Liz grabs her stuff and leaves locking both
of the locks behind her Charlie stares forward vacantly

INT - HALLWAY - THAT NIGHT 28

Charlie in his wheelchair is in front of the slightly
opened door to the second bedroom

Taking a breath he pushes the door completely open and looks
inside the darkened room He reaches up and flips the light
switch Nothing happens He flips it a few more times He
moves inside the room just slightly unable to go through the
door fully

INT - SECOND BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 29

Charlie looks around the room the room is only barely lit
from the light spilling from the hallway It’s obvious he
hasn’t been in here for quite some time

Charlie looks around the room He leans in taking a big
breath through his nose taking in the smell of the room He
closes his eyes He takes another big breath in smiling

Charlie opens his eyes looking around the room Near the
door there is a bookcase with a few different books on it
He spots a simple well-worn hard-bound NIV translation of
the Bible with the number “72” written in marker on the fore
edge His smile disappears

Charlie breathes in and out becoming upset Sweat starts to
stream down his face His pulse quickens

After a moment he quickly moves out of the room shutting
the door behind him

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 31

Charlie is in his wheelchair scanning through a book of
poetry reading to himself

A knock at the front door

DELIVERY BOY (0S)
Gambino’s

CHARLIE

DELIVERY BOY (0S)
Money in the mailbox leave it on
the bench

money and leave the pizza He doesn’t hear anything Another
moment passes

DELIVERY BOY (0S)

Pause

CHARLIE

DELIVERY BOY (0S)
Hey Charlie

We hear the sound of the mailbox opening and shutting

DELIVERY BOY (0S) (CONTD)
Have a good night okay

We hear the sound of the delivery boy going down the stairs
Charlie looks at the front door

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER 32

Charlie is in his wheelchair in front of the television
watching 2016 primary election coverage A pizza box sits on
the couch with one piece uneaten and a few crusts here and
there Charlie is finishing the next-to-last slice when he
notices Ellie’s notebook sitting on the other side of the
couch With his reaching claw he picks up Ellie’s notebook

He takes the remote turns off the television He opens the
notebook to the first page

Written in the notebook are three separate lines “This
apartment smells This notebook is retarded I hate
everyone”

Charlie looks at it for a moment then smiles broadly

CHARLIE
(reading softly to
himself )
“This apartment smells This
notebook is retarded I hate
everyone”

Charlie thinks for a moment He reads it again counting out
the syllables on his fingers

CHARLIE (CONTD)
(counting to five)
This apartment smells
(counting to seven)
This notebook is retarded
(counting to five)
I hate everyone

Charlie smiles wider He begins to laugh a little The
laughter grows and soon it causes a sudden pain in his chest
the most severe he’s had so far He grabs his chest speaking
softly to himself

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I felt saddest of all when I read
the boring chapters that were only
descriptions of whales because I
knew that the author was just
trying to save us from his own sad
story just for a little while
This apartment smells

The pain starts to subside He takes a few deep breaths
starts to smile again

CHARLIE (CONTD)
This apartment smells I hate
everyone The author was just
trying to save us from his own sad
story I hate everyone I hate
everyone

Charlie is at the door on his wheelchair He opens it up
Ellie stands outside holding her backpack Short pause

ELLIE
You have it

CHARLIE
It’s almost done You can wait
while I finish it up print it

Ellie looks at the door annoyed Finally she relents comes
inside and sits on the recliner She pulls out her phone

CHARLIE (CONTD)
While you’re here maybe you could
write a little more in your
notebook

Charlie pulls out Ellie’s notebook extends it to her

ELLIE
Oh my God

CHARLIE
Youve only written a couple
sentences so far can you write
more

ELLIE
I kind of hate you

CHARLIE
Yeah but you hate everyone

Charlie smiles broadly at her Ellie looks away

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Look just keep going forget the
poem just write whatever you want
whatever you’re thinking--

ELLIE
Be quiet just--

Ellie fumes then grabs the notebook out of Charlie’s hand
She finds a pen plops down into a chair and opens it up She
stares at the blank page Finally she starts to write a
little

Charlie looks at her lovingly Pause After a moment he
wheels himself a little closer to her speaking tentatively

CHARLIE
You know I I was in a strange
place in my life when I married
your mom--

ELLIE
Did I fucking ask

CHARLIE
Sorry I just I’m sorry
(pause)
I understand that you’re angry But
you don’t need to be angry at the
whole world just be angry at me--

ELLIE
You know what You can’t throw me
away like a piece of garbage and
then suddenly want to be my dad
eight years later You left me for
your boyfriend it’s really that
simple And if you’ve been telling
yourself anything different then
youve been lying to yourself

This stings Charlie is at a loss

ELLIE (CONTD)
But you know what I’m glad
because you taught me something
very important people are
assholes Most people learn that
way too late you taught me that
when I was eight Thank you for
that

Ellie takes the notebook starts writing again Silence

ELLIE (CONTD)
You know you couldve

CHARLIE
What

Pause

ELLIE
You could’ve been sending us money
If you have all that money and
wanted to be a part of my life so
bad you could have been sending
money to my mom

CHARLIE
I did

ELLIE
I mean more than just child
support

Pause Ellie continues to write in the notebook Charlie
moves toward her in the wheelchair He reaches out puts a
hand on the notebook Ellie stops writing

CHARLIE
I did
(pause)
When I left your mom She didn’t
want me around you I hoped she’d
eventually change her mind but
she

Pause Ellie stares down not looking at him
ELLIE
You could have just fucking called
me All this time You could have
been part of my life
Pause
CHARLIE
Ellie look at me Who would want
me to be a part of their life
Charlie looks at her Ellie stares back at him It’s the
closest they’ve been to one another yet Ellie is starting to
crack a bit

But just as quickly as the moment came Ellie ends it
looking away

Pause

ELLIE
I’m hungry

Pause

CHARLIE
There’s stuff for sandwiches in the
fridge

Ellie gets up goes to the kitchen without looking at
Charlie She opens up the fridge takes out cold cuts
mustard bread She looks back at Charlie

ELLIE
I’1l make you one but it’s going
to be small And I’m only using
turkey or chicken and no
mayonnaise

She opens a jar of mustard finds a breadknife Charlie looks
at her smiling Ellie looks at him stops clearly annoyed

ELLIE (CONTD)

What
CHARLIE
No it’s just--
(pause)

Youre an amazing person Ellie I
hope you know what an amazing
person you are I couldn’t ask for
a more incredible daughter

Silence Charlie smiles broadly at her Ellie stares back at
him

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I’1l print it out for you now

Charlie opens his laptop pulling up a document He hits
print and a printer in a corner comes to life Charlie
watches the printer thinking

We hear the sound of flapping wings Ellie looks at the
window in the living room sees the robin from before eating
freshly cut pieces of apple off the plate She stares at it

She looks down at the breadknife in her hand her knuckles
growing white She silently digs the knife into the kitchen
counter gouging the surface

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER 35
Charlie is asleep in the wheelchair with a mostly eaten
sandwich in his lap Ellie sits on the couch a plate with a

half-eaten sandwich sits on the coffee table in front of her

Ellie stares at Charlie who is snoring lightly

Ellie lifts her hands to her mouth She’s holding a small
marijuana pipe and a lighter She takes a hit blowing it in
Charlie’s direction She thinks for a moment looking around

INT - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 36

Ellie makes her way down the hallway still holding the pipe
and lighter She glances inside Charlie’s bedroom sees the
stained mattress She recoils

She looks at the closed door to the second bedroom She goes
to it opening it For the first time we get a good look at
the room The bedroom in stark contrast to the rest of the
apartment is perfectly organized and well-kept There is no
trash nothing is stained The bed is made framed pictures
of Charlie and Alan on the dresser are perfectly arranged
But everything looks like it’s been untouched for several
years giving everything a muted quality like the resin that
browns pigments on medieval paintings

She looks inside at the clean and orderly room curious and a
little shocked She sees the photos of Alan and Charlie on
the dresser She looks at the bed For a brief moment we see
a hint of compassion on her face

Just then--a knock at the front door Ellie freezes not
knowing what to do

Another knock Ellie returns to the living room

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 37

Ellie frantically puts the pot pipe and lighter into
Charlie’s hand He remains asleep

ELLIE
Yeah

THOMAS
(calling out)
I uh Hello

Ellie pauses recognizing the voice She grabs the pot pipe
and lighter

She moves to the door unlocking it and swinging it open
Thomas stands in the doorway

THOMAS (CONTD)
Oh hi

Thomas sees the pipe in Ellie’s hand

THOMAS (CONTD)
Are you--

ELLIE
Come inside

Thomas cautiously makes his way inside Ellie shuts the door
behind him without locking it Thomas sees Charlie

THOMAS
Is he--

Thomas goes to Charlie looking at him

THOMAS (CONTD)
Is he okay

ELLIE
I don’t know I ground up some
Ambien and put it in his sandwich

THOMAS
Wait what

ELLIE
I only gave him a couple he’s
fine I can take like three at a
time

Ellie moves to the couch sits down

THOMAS
You have-- Where did you get
Ambien

ELLIE

I had sex with a pharmacist
Thomas stares at her

ELLIE (CONTD)
Just kidding gross My mom pops
them like Tic Tacs

THOMAS
I don’t know if he should be
taking

Ellie takes a hit from the pipe Thomas watches her
ELLIE

(exhaling)
Does this make you nervous

Thomas looks away

ELLIE (CONTD)
It’s just pot It’s not like I’m
smoking meth or anything

THOMAS
I know-- I know what pot is

ELLIE
You only think you know what pot is
because your parents told you a
bunch of lies about it

THOMAS
Don’t-- I know what drugs are
I’ve smoked pot before

ELLIE
Oo I’m so impressed
THOMAS
I’m not trying to impress you--
ELLIE
You have not smoked pot
THOMAS
Yes I have it was Kind of a
problem
ELLIE

That is the stupidest fucking thing
I’ve ever heard in my entire life

THOMAS
I was smoking every day I had a
problem

ELLIE

You were a stoner You had a hobby

Ellie takes another hit blowing it at Thomas Thomas gets
up moving to the door

THOMAS
Okay look just tell him I was here
and I’11--

ELLIE

If you leave I’1l feed him the rest
of the pills I have in the bottle

Thomas stops turns to Ellie
THOMAS
What

Ellie grabs her backpack reaches inside pulls out a bottle

of prescription pills She examines the bottle

ELLIE
There’s like twenty or thirty more
I’‘1l crush them up and put them in
some water and pour it down his
throat

Thomas goes to Ellie

THOMAS
You wouldn’t actually do that
would you

ELLIE
Sit down

Thomas looks at her for a moment then sits down
his distance

Ellie looks at him Thomas looks away

ELLIE (CONTD)
Why do you keep coming back here

THOMAS
He needs help He needs God in his
life right now

ELLIE
That’s a stupid reason Do you
think he wants to have sex with
you That’s so gross oh my God

Ellie extends the pipe to Thomas

THOMAS
I don’t want--

ELLIE
If you don’t take a hit I’m gonna
call the police and tell them you
tried to rape me Take a hit

Thomas stares at her incredulous

THOMAS
I don’t understand you at all

maintaining

ELLIE
Oh my God

They stare at each other for a moment Finally Thomas
relents and takes the pipe

THOMAS
Is there a carb on this

ELLIE
Oo I’m so impressed

THOMAS
I wasn’t trying to--

ELLIE
There isn’t a carb

Thomas pauses then tentatively lights the pipe and takes a
hit Before he’s done inhaling Ellie takes out her phone and
takes a picture of him

Thomas coughs violently almost drops the pipe

ELLIE (CONTD)
Calm down

THOMAS
What are you gonna do with that
picture

ELLIE
I’m gonna masturbate to it Is that
what you want me to say You’re a
pervert take another hit

Thomas stares at her Pause Ellie sighs buries her face in
her hands

ELLIE (CONTD)
Look I’m just fucking with you

Pause
THOMAS
You’re not going to give him more
Ambien

Ellie shakes her head

THOMAS (CONTD)
Why do you keep coming back here

ELLIE
I don’t know

THOMAS
Seriously if you hate him so much--

ELLIE
I’m done answering questions now

Pause Thomas looks at the pipe in his hand for a moment

THOMAS
Can I take a hit

ELLIE
It goes against your religion and
that makes you a hypocrite Go
ahead

Thomas considers for a moment then takes another hit--a
larger one than before He exhales

Ellie takes another photo of him with her phone

THOMAS
I really wish you wouldn’t do that--

ELLIE
Yeah I heard you the first time Do
you find me attractive

Pause Thomas looks at her caught off guard

THOMAS
--

ELLIE
Because I’m not attracted to you at
all just to let you know I’m not
trying to be mean or anything I
just don’t think you’re good
looking Or interesting Or
intelligent

Pause Ellie looks at Thomas who is a little hurt She rolls
her eyes gets up goes into the kitchen looking for food

ELLIE (CONTD)
Oh my God grow up maybe someone
else finds you attractive Maybe my
dad finds you attractive

THOMAS
I really wish you wouldn’t--

ELLIE
It’s so easy to make you
uncomfortable it’s a little sad
You can cash that out

Pause Thomas takes another large hit He’s pretty high by
this point Ellie finds a bag of potato chips comes back
into the living room She eats the chips as she talks

Pause

THOMAS
If my parents knew that I was
getting high that I was getting
high while I was out witnessing for
the church--

ELLIE
You’re not from New Life

THOMAS
What

Pause Ellie continues to eat potato chips moves back to the
couch and sits next to Thomas

ELLIE
There’s a kid a grade below me who
goes there He said they stopped
doing door-to-door stuff last year
when a lady was out preaching or
whatever and a guy answered his
door with no clothes on

Pause Thomas stares at Ellie for a second then starts to

stand up

THOMAS
I need to go

Thomas gathers his things shaky on his feet He goes to the

door

ELLIE
Who are you really

Thomas heads to the door Ellie jumps up from the couch
getting between Thomas and the door

Thomas turns around dazed and panicked He looks around the
room looks at the window then heads down the hall Ellie
follows him

Thomas panicked and unsure of what to do goes into the
second bedroom and shuts the door on Ellie

Ellie tries the door Thomas has locked it

ELLIE (CONTD)
C’mon tell me

THOMAS (0OS)
Why do you care

ELLIE
Because I think we have a
blossoming friendship

Pause

INTERCUT - SECOND BEDROOMHALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 38

Thomas sits down on the ground leaning his back against the
door He pauses

THOMAS
You’re just messing with me

ELLIE
No I’m not

Pause Thomas exhales looks around the room regarding the
untouched bed the photos on the dresser

THOMAS
You won’t tell anyone

ELLIE
Who am I gonna tell

Pause Ellie sits down on the ground listening

THOMAS
I was on a mission With a group
from my church back in Waterloo
my hometown in Iowa When my dad
caught me smoking pot he thought a
mission would be a good idea Truth
is he was probably just embarrassed
by me and wanted me gone for a
while

(pause)
(MORE)

THOMAS (CONTD)
Anyway I just--left I couldn’t do
it anymore

ELLIE
Why

THOMAS
The mission leader this guy Jerry--
all he had us doing was standing on
corners handing out pamphlets At
the end of each day he’d be like
“look how many people we’re
helping” I tried to talk to him
about different ways to minister
different ways to actually help
people But you could tell he
wouldn’t’ve cared He didn’t need
to earn or prove his faith at all
So after a while I was like--wait
am I actually like helping
anybody

ELLIE
No You were not

THOMAS
I started to feel that way too

ELLIE
I don’t feel that way I know you
weren’t helping people It doesn’t
help people to tell them to believe
in God Why would that help people

THOMAS
I just--I want to believe it All
my family my friends they’re so--
happy I just want to be like that

ELLIE
But why did you leave then

Thomas stands up moving across the room He looks at the
photos on the dresser picking one up It leaves an imprint
of itself on the dresser exposing the accumulated dust

Pause

THOMAS
I was--worried that I might get
arrested

ELLIE

For smoking pot
Ellie thinks for a moment then pulls out her phone She

THOMAS
For stealing from the mission

opens up a voice memo app She presses record placing her
phone at the base of the door

Pause

THOMAS (CONTD)

One day I finally just--ditched
the pamphlets Went door to door
started actually engaging with
people Finally felt like I was
doing something Helping people
maybe

(pause)
That night at the mission meeting
I told everyone what I did that
day and Jerry was like “that’s
not what we do buddy” and I was
like “well why not” and we ended
up having this huge argument in
front of everyone and So that
night I decided to leave And when
everyone was asleep I--took the
petty cash

ELLIE
How much

THOMAS
Two-thousand four-hundred and
thirty-six dollars

ELLIE
Oh
THOMAS
Yeah Oh
(pause)

And I just--got on a bus Jerry and
my parents were calling me over and
over eventually I just tossed my
phone After a while I ended up
here

(pause)
I thought I could use this money
for my own mission see my faith
save just one person And now I’m
almost out of money I can’t go
home my parents probably wanna
disown me I don’t know what to do

Thomas sees the old Bible sitting on the bookshelf that
Charlie was staring at before He goes to it

ELLIE
You’re more interesting to me now

THOMAS
Thanks

Thomas takes the Bible opening it up There is a stamp on
the first page that reads “Property of New Life Church” and a
hand-written name in the corner “Alan Grant”

Thomas flips through the Bible which has obviously been
meticulously studied--nearly every page has highlights
notes or underlines He smiles slightly touching the pages
He lands on one particular page in Romans sees a couple of
verses that have been heavily highlighted underlined
circled--more than any other verse

INT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 39

Ellie stands at the door looking down at her phone which is
still recording

ELLIE
So that’s why you wanna save my
dad

The bedroom door unlocks Ellie quickly grabs her phone
shuts off the recording She puts it in her pocket

The door slowly opens Thomas stands looking at her holding
the Bible Silence

Ellie takes her phone out and takes a picture of Thomas She
smiles at him

Suddenly the sound of the front door opening

Ellie rushes into the living room followed by Thomas

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 40
Just as Ellie and Thomas come into the room the front door
opens and Liz enters followed by MARY a harried woman in
her 40s

Ellie sees Mary she goes to her

ELLIE
(to Mary)
Mom-—
MARY
Shut up

Liz looks at Thomas and Ellie Thomas quickly grabs his
things and hurries to the door the Bible still in his hand
Liz glares at him

Thomas quickly leaves Liz turns and sees Charlie still
asleep in his wheelchair

LIZ
Charlie Charlie

Liz goes to Charlie Mary turns and finally gets a look at
Charlie She freezes for a moment shocked

Liz shakes Charlie a bit trying to wake him up She checks
his breathing

Mary goes to Charlie as he wheezes loudly in his sleep She
looks at him closely

MARY
Charlie

Mary gets closer examining his body in disbelief She looks
him up and down as Ellie moves into the living room

Mary looks away upset Liz continues to shake Charlie

Pause Mary and Liz both look at Ellie Ellie stares back at
them defiant

INT - LIVING ROOM - SHORTLY LATER 41

Liz is hooking Charlie up to an oxygen tank threading a
plastic tube over his ears and under his nose Charlie is
noticeably weaker than before and he is wheezing more
heavily

Ellie sits at the dining table Mary sits with her nervously
fiddling in her coat pockets She takes out a pack of
cigarettes along with a lighter Liz notices

LIZ
Not with the oxygen tank

MARY
I’1l stand by the window

Liz stares daggers at Mary Annoyed Mary puts her cigarettes
and lighter away Charlie looks at Mary He smiles a little

CHARLIE
(to Mary)
Ellie told you that she was coming
over here

LIZ
No I did And just in time looks
like You having more pain

Charlie nods

LIZ (CONTD)
How easy is it to move

CHARLIE
Not very

LIZ
Any confusion Have you felt
disoriented forgotten where you
are or what you’re doing

Charlie shakes his head Liz finishes hooking him up to the
oxygen tank looks at him

CHARLIE
Am I--okay

LIZ
No you’re not okay But as far as
the sleeping pills you’re fine I
don’t think she gave you much

ELLIE
Yeah that’s what I told you

Liz goes to Ellie standing over her

LIZ
You know I was a very angry very
stupid little girl once too but if
you would have given him more pills
than that--

ELLIE
Yeah except I didn’t give him more
than that I gave him two pills

MARY
Ellie how much money did he offer
you

Charlie looks at Mary pleading

MARY (CONTD)
All of it

ELLIE
How do you know about--

MARY
(to Ellie)
You think I’m an idiot You think I
would believe that you were coming
over here out of the kindness of
your heart

LIZ
Charlie doesn’t have any money

Mary looks at Liz Liz goes back to Charlie attaching the
oxygen tank to the back of his wheelchair

MARY
(to Charlie)
She doesn’t know

CHARLIE
Mary--

MARY
(to Liz)
Where do you think all the money
from his teaching has been going
The account for Ellie by now it
has to be huge

(to Charlie)
Over a hundred thousand at least
right

Liz circles the wheelchair faces Charlie

LIZ
That’s not true is it

Charlie looks away from Liz Silence

LIZ (CONTD)

Charlie we could have gotten you
anything you needed Special beds
physical therapists fucking health
insurance

(pause)
Last winter when my pickup broke
down and I had to walk through the
snow to get your groceries-—-—

CHARLIE
I offered to get your truck fixed--

LIZ
Yeah and I refused because I
thought you had seven hundred
dollars in your bank account

Liz looks at him deeply hurt Charlie reaches out to her
trying to take her hand she backs away from him

CHARLIE
That money’s for Ellie It’s always
been for Ellie
(pause)
If there was ever any type of
emergency I would have given you
the money--

LIZ
Would you

Pause Liz stares at him for a moment then looks away She
fights the instinct to cry Finally she looks around the
room then grabs her bag and heads to the front door

CHARLIE
Wait--

Liz leaves slamming the door behind her Mary stares at
Charlie Silence

ELLIE
Mom you’re not getting any of my
money

MARY

Oh shut up Ellie
Mary stands up She looks at Ellie

MARY (CONTD)
Leave right now

Ellie glares at Mary then angrily grabs her bag and heads
toward the door

CHARLIE
Wait--

Charlie struggles to wheel himself toward Ellie

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Ellie I know you didn’t mean to
hurt me I know you--

ELLIE
Okay you know what Listen to me

Ellie goes to Charlie leans down to him looking him
straight in the eye

ELLIE (CONTD)

that through your fucking skull

Charlie looks at her pleading He reaches out toward her

CHARLIE

Ellie swats his hand away

ELLIE

MARY

Ellie stares at Charlie for a moment longer then goes to the
door opening it Just before she leaves

CHARLIE
Ellie your-- Your essay

Ellie stops Charlie moves to the printer taking the pages
out He puts the pages in a manila folder extends it to
Ellie Ellie doesn’t look at him

CHARLIE (CONTD)
It’s a really good essay

Ellie pauses for a moment then grabs the folder out of
Charlie’s hand without looking at him Ellie leaves Charlie
watches her go

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 41A

Mary looks at Charlie Silence apart from Charlie’s wheezing

Mary stands Very slowly she approaches him circles his
wheelchair looking at him from all sides

MARY
Jesus Charlie

She finally stops looks at him in the eyes Charlie looks
away ashamed

Mary turns away from him sighing rubbing her face with her
hands

MARY (CONTD)
Do you--have anything

Charlie looks at her unsure of what she means Mary
continues to look at him Charlie realizes

CHARLIE
Above the sink Kitchen counter on
the left

Mary goes into the kitchen opening a cabinet above the sink
She finds an aging half-empty bottle of vodka She takes the
bottle then opens other cabinets looking for a glass

MARY
Our deal was we wait until she was
out of the house to give her the
money

CHARLIE
What’s the difference

MARY
The difference is she’s seventeen
and in high school She’s gonna
spend it on ponies or face tattoos
or something

Mary finds a glass pours herself a drink
CHARLIE

I think she’s a little smarter than
that

Mary drinks taking a deep breath She relazes a bit

MARY
So how has it been Getting to
know her

CHARLIE
She’s Amazing

Mary chuckles

MARY
You still do that

CHARLIE
What

MARY
That positivity It’s so annoying

CHARLIE
Well you’re a complete cynic I was
just trying to balance us out

Mary smiles a bit

MARY
Well I guess I do miss that That
one thing

CHARLIE
Just that

MARY

That and the cooking Last month I
tried to make a stir-fry thing
almost set the entire apartment
building on fire

Charlie laughs a little which quickly results in a coughing
fit Mary looks at him She takes her drink and finds a place
to sit

MARY (CONTD)
I never knew you were doing this to
yourself

CHARLIE
Well you never asked how I was
doing

Mary looks at him annoyed

MARY
Well you never asked how I was
doing either Every month it’s
just “how much money do you
need” and “how’s Ellie”

CHARLIE
You didn’t tell me she was flunking
out of school

MARY
I guess I just didn’t need the
lecture about my involvement in her
education
CHARLIE
That’s not what I

Charlie exhales He looks at her Silence

CHARLIE (CONTD)
How’re you doing Mary

Pause Mary doesn’t look at him She drinks

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I know I’m not supposed to be
around her You could probably call
the police if you really wanted to--

MARY
Christ you really think Id do
that

CHARLIE

You fought me pretty hard for full
custody And I don’t blame you for
keeping her from me I--

MARY
Charlie need I remind you you
left us

CHARLIE
I know

MARY

And I was left raising our kid and
explaining to people that my
husband left me for a man

CHARLIE
But you didn’t have to cut me out
of her life like that--

MARY
Oh please you were more than happy
to forget about us for a while You
know that

This stings Charlie looks away Pause

CHARLIE
I’ve made--a lot of mistakes I
know that But I just wanted to see
her Mary I’ve always just wanted
to see her
MARY
It’s all about you even now huh
(pause)
Well now you know why I kept you
from her

Mary grabs her glass heads back into the kitchen and pours

another glass of vodka

CHARLIE
(confused)

Pause

MARY
She’s Awful Isn’t she

Charlie looks at her confused

MARY (CONTD)
She’s a terror And you think it’s
my fault

Pause

CHARLIE
Wait is that why you’ve been
keeping her from me all this time
Because you thought I’d think you
were a bad mother

MARY
At first But later when she was
fifteen sixteen I was worried
she would hurt you

CHARLIE
Hurt me That’s ridiculous--

MARY
I don’t take any pleasure in
admitting it I’m her mother for
Christ’s sake I spent way too much
time telling myself she’s just
rebellious she’s just difficult
Charlie she’s evil

CHARLIE
She is not evil

Mary looks at him for a moment then goes to the couch

opens Charlie’s laptop

She

CHARLIE (CONTD)
What’re you doing

Mary opens a web browser starts typing

MARY
You think it’s just me

Mary shows Charlie the laptop which is open to Ellie’s
Facebook page Displayed prominently is the photo of Charlie
that Ellie took before Charlie examines the photo

Charlie scrolls down a bit revealing the photo’s caption
CHARLIE
(reading)
“There’1l be a grease fire in hell
when he starts to burn”

Pause Mary shuts the laptop putting it back on the computer
desk

MARY
Don’t feel bad I’ve made quite a
few appearances on that thing
Mary sits down with her glass taking a long drink
Charlie is silent staring forward

Pause

CHARLIE
She’s a strong writer

Mary slams down the glass of vodka

MARY
That’s your response

CHARLIE
This isn’t evil this is honesty
Do you know how much bullshit I’ve
read in my life

MARY
My God I don’t understand you
Charlie

CHARLIE

Every time I would call and ask you
how she was doing you said she was
fine if she’s so evil then why--

MARY
What was I supposed to tell you
That she was off making her
classmates cry or slashing her
teachers’ tires You didn’t want to
hear about that stuff

CHARLIE
I could have helped her

MARY
She doesn’t want your help She
doesn’t want anyone

Mary a little drunk by this point starts wandering
aimlessly

MARY (CONTD)

You think I didn’t want her to have
a dad She adored you The only
reason you married me in the first
place was to have a kid I know
that

CHARLIE
Mary Please

Mary stops Silence

Finally she relents and goes into the kitchen She pours the
remainder of her drink into the sink

MARY
Well this brings back memories
doesn’t it

Mary comes back into the main room sits back down on the
couch near Charlie Charlie smiles at her

MARY (CONTD)
Listen I I never got to say
that I was sorry

CHARLIE
What would you have to be sorry
about

MARY

That’s not what I mean I mean
about Your friend

CHARLIE
Oh
(pause)
His name was Alan

MARY

I know his fucking name Charlie

(pause)
I saw him once in the Walmart
parking lot He wasn’t looking too
good I think it wasn’t long before
he Anyway I had all these things
I wanted to say to him hurl at him
like bricks but I Asked him if
he wanted some help He let me
carry a couple of bags to his car
for him he said thank you and I
left I never even told him who I
was

They look at one another Charlie struggles for breath his
wheezing particularly noticeable now that they are close

MARY (CONTD)
You’re wheezing

CHARLIE
Yeah it’s gotten worse

MARY

Should I call someone
CHARLIE

No I
MARY

Let me hear

Charlie looks at her Pause Then Charlie leans back in his
wheelchair putting one arm in the air

Mary gets up and goes to Charlie She bends down putting her
ear on his chest She listens for a moment

CHARLIE
How do I sound

Mary doesn’t respond she puts a hand on Charlie’s chest and
closes her eyes

CHARLIE (CONTD)
That was the first time weve all
been together in almost nine years
you realize that

Mary buries her face in Charlie’s chest struggling to
maintain herself Pause

CHARLIE (CONTD)
When Ellie was little when we did
that trip to the Oregon Coast
together We laid on the beach
Ellie played in the sand later I
went swimming in the ocean Last
time I ever went swimming
actually

Very slowly we begin to hear the sound of ocean waves in the
background

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I kept cutting my legs on the
rocks and the water was so cold
and you were so mad that my legs
bled and stained the seats in the
minivan

Charlie laughs a little Mary laughs as well Her laughs
quickly turn into heavy silent sobs She continues to bury
her face in his chest

CHARLIE (CONTD)
And you said for days after that I
smelled like seawater You remember
that

Charlie lowers his arm putting it on Mary’s back They hold
one another for a moment as the sound of waves subsides

MARY
You sound awful

CHARLIE
I’m dying Mary

Mary remains for a moment longer before pushing herself off
of him holding back tears

MARY
Fuck you

CHARLIE
I’m sorry

MARY

Fuck you

Mary backs away not looking at Charlie Pause

MARY (CONTD)
For sure

CHARLIE
Yeah For sure

Charlie wheels himself over to Mary

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Listen to me I need to make
certain that she’s going to be
okay We can’t give up on her

Pause Mary looks at Charlie her anger growing

MARY
You already gave up on her You
gave up on her when she was eight
years old

CHARLIE
I wish I would have been a part of
her life Mary both of your lives--

MARY
Go to the hospital You have money
go to the hospital

CHARLIE
We both know that money is for
Ellie But beyond that I have to
make sure that she’s going to be
alright that she’s going to have a
decent life where people care for
her and she cares for other
people She doesn’t have anyone
else Mary

MARY
I need to-- I have to go

Mary grabs her purse heading toward the front door

CHARLIE
(desperate)
I need to know I did one thing
right in my life

Mary stops at the door She waits for a moment not looking
at Charlie

MARY
We both did our parts I raised
her you’re giving her the money
It’s the best we could do

Mary stands at the door unmoving still not looking at
Charlie Charlie is at a loss

MARY (CONTD)
Do you need anything before I
leave
(pause)
Water or something

Charlie doesn’t respond Mary waits for a beat then leaves

Charlie is left alone wheezing He closes his eyes leaning
his head up

INT - LIVING ROOM - THAT NIGHT 42

Hours later Charlie is dozing in his wheelchair his phone
on his chest His wheezing is heavy he’s only partially able
to sleep Suddenly he wakes up with a start He looks
around momentarily confused Just then the phone resting on
his chest falls to the floor bouncing toward the window
where the bird had been

Charlie notices that the window is slightly open He slowly
wheels himself toward the window He looks outside sees that
the plate with the pieces of apple on it has been smashed to
bits

A knock at the door Charlie

DELIVERY BOY (0S)
Gambino’s

Pause Charlie stares for a moment longer then finally snaps
out of it

CHARLIE
Yeah

DELIVERY BOY (0S)
Charlie You okay

CHARLIE
Yeah
(pause)
Money’s in the uh
42A

DELIVERY BOY (0S)
Sure
The sound of a mail box opening and shutting

DELIVERY BOY (0S) (CONTD)
You sure you’re doing okay

Pause
CHARLIE
Yeah Dan
(pause)
Thanks

DELIVERY BOY (0S)
Have a good night okay

Charlie listens for a moment we hear the sound of the
delivery boy walking away

Charlie waits one more moment then starts wheeling himself
over to the front door the reaching claw in his lap
EXT - APARTMENT FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS 42A

Charlie maneuvers the claw toward the pizza boxes trying to
grab an edge of the box

As he’s struggling to get a grip on the pizza boxes he
glances up The delivery boy is standing in the stairwell
having only descended a step or two staring at Charlie
Charlie stops He slowly lifts his head up looking back at
him There is a very long silence as they look at one another
in silence

Finally

DELIVERY BOY
Jesus

The delivery boy averts his eyes staring at the floor
Charlie continues to stare at him as the delivery boy finally
descends the stairway

Charlie remains in the doorway for a moment motionless

OMITTED 43

OMITTED 44
OMITTED 45
OMITTED 46
INT - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 47

Charlie is ravenously eating the pizza chewing and
swallowing dangerously fast Sweat pours down his face

Still eating the pizza Charlie opens up his laptop He logs
on to his teaching software then begins to write a post to
all of his students in all of his classes

We see only bits and pieces of what he’s writing “fuck these
ridiculous essays” “fuck the readings” and most notably
“JUST WRITE SOMETHING FUCKING HONEST”

He slams his laptop shut

He searches around the kitchen finds a few more bits of
food some cereal bars potato chips various junk food

He has a pain in his chest he doubles over Just after the

pain hits he is overcome with a wave of nausea He reaches

under the sink grabbing a trash can He holds the can up to
his head vomiting into it

Finally he begins to calm down His breathing slowly returns
to normal He puts the trash can down on the floor

He looks around the apartment holding back tears
Just then a loud knock at the front door

CHARLIE
Liz

THOMAS (0S)
Can I come inside

Charlie grabs some paper towels off the counter cleaning off
his face a bit

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Charlie barely manages to wheel himself out of the kitchen
and into the living room moving toward the door A dog in a
nearby apartment starts barking

CHARLIE
It’s not locked

Thomas comes bounding inside full of evangelical fervor

THOMAS
Thank you hi--

Thomas makes his way inside shutting the door behind him
Charlie pivots facing Thomas

Pause

CHARLIE
What’s wrong

THOMAS
Listen I’m not-- I’m not exactly
who I said I was I’m not from New
Life

CHARLIE
I don’t--

THOMAS
I’ve been in a pretty bad place
recently I sort of stole some
money and ran away a few months
ago And your daughter she took
these pictures of me smoking pot
and she made a recording or
something and she found my church
back in Waterloo somehow and sent
it to them and they sent it to my
parents--

CHARLIE
Wait--

THOMAS
And you know what they said It’s
just money They forgive me They
love me and they want me to come
home
(pause)
How awful is that

Charlie looks at Thomas Pause

CHARLIE
Ellie she-- She did all that

THOMAS
And I can’t really tell if she was
trying to help me or hurt me do
you ever get that feeling with her

Charlie smiles a little looks up He lets out a little
laugh

CHARLIE
(smiling)
How did she even-- She found your
church tracked down your parents
She really did all that

THOMAS
Yeah I’m going home tomorrow But
Charlie before I leave

Charlie doesn’t listen to Thomas smiles wider letting out a
big laugh The laughter causes Charlie pain he grabs his
chest Thomas goes to him

THOMAS (CONTD)
What’s wrong

CHARLIE
Nothing it just-- It just hurts

THOMAS
Charlie I want to help you I know
I can help you

CHARLIE
I’m not going to the hospital--

THOMAS
I know I won’t make you go but I
can help you

Charlie looks at Thomas sees that he’s holding something He
squints slowly starting to realize that he’s holding Alans
Bible

Thomas opens the Bible flips a few pages

CHARLIE
What are you--

THOMAS

(reading)
“Therefore brothers and sisters
we have an obligation--but it is
not to the flesh to live according
to it For if you live according to
the flesh you will die but if by
the Spirit you put to death the
misdeeds of the body you will
live”

Thomas looks at Charlie He gives Charlie the Bible pointing
to the verse from before that has been especially
highlighted underlined circled

CHARLIE
I don’t Understand

THOMAS
When I read this I finally got it
I finally understood why God
brought me here to you So I could
help you understand what happened
to Alan so it won’t happen to you
too

Pause Charlie looks at the Bible then at Thomas

CHARLIE
How did you get this

THOMAS
Charlie--Alan tried to escape Gods
will He chose his life with you
over God But this is why he was
obsessed with this verse he knew
he was living in the flesh not in
the Spirit He never prayed for
salvation--but it’s not too late
for you Through the Spirit you
can put to death the misdeeds of
the body and you will live

Thomas grabs Charlie’s hand Charlie stares at him

CHARLIE
You think Alan died--because he
chose to be with me You think God
turned his back on him because he
and I were in love

Pause Thomas considers carefully Finally

THOMAS
Yes

They stare at one another in silence

CHARLIE
You know I wasn’t always this big

Pause

THOMAS
Yeah I know

CHARLIE
I mean I was never the best looking
guy in the room but Alan loved me
He thought I was beautiful

THOMAS
Okay--

Thomas lets go of Charlie’s hand moving away from him

CHARLIE
Halfway through the semester he
started meeting me during my office
hours We were both crazy about one
another but we waited until the
course was over before

THOMAS
This isn’t--

CHARLIE
It was just after classes had ended
for the year it was a perfect
temperature outside We went for a
walk in the arboretum and we
kissed--

THOMAS
Charlie stop

Thomas turns moves away from Charlie Charlie follows him in
his wheelchair

CHARLIE
We would spend entire nights lying
together naked We would make
love

Thomas looks away from him

CHARLIE (CONTD)
We would make love Do you find
that disgusting

THOMAS
Charlie God is ready to help you--

CHARLIE
I hope there isn’t a God

Charlie continues to build in volume growing to a shout

CHARLIE (CONTD)
I hope there isn’t a God because I
hate thinking that there’s an
afterlife that Alan can see what
I’ve done to myself

THOMAS
Charlie--

CHARLIE
That he can see my swollen feet
the sores on my skin the patches
of mold in between the flaps--

Thomas recoils turning away from Charlie

THOMAS
Okay stop

CHARLIE
--the infected ulcers on my ass
the sack of fat on my back that
turned brown last year--

THOMAS
Stop

CHARLIE
This is disgusting

THOMAS
Yes

CHARLIE

I’M DISGUSTING
Thomas turns to Charlie aggressively shouting at him

THOMAS
YES YOU’RE DISGUSTING YOU’RE--
48A

Thomas stops himself moving away in shame They are left
together in silence

Charlie looks at the Bible in his hands

CHARLIE
(not speaking to Thomas)
I’m sorry

THOMAS
What

Pause Charlie extends the Bible to Thomas

CHARLIE
Go home to your family

Thomas looks at Charlie for a moment He goes to Charlie
tentatively taking the Bible from him He slowly makes his
way to the front door and leaves

Charlie tries to calm himself down After a few moments he
begins to wheel himself down the hallway

CUT TO

TITLE FRIDAY 48A

INT - LIVING ROOM - DAWN 49

Charlie--exhausted and in constant pain--is in front of the
framed photo of himself and Alan on the Oregon Coast still
turned face down He reaches up to the photo and slowly turns
it right-side up He leans back

He stares at the photo unblinking Morning light barely
begins to creep in through the window

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING 50

Charlie tired and dazed sweat pouring down his face is
sitting on the couch in front of his laptop The virtual
classroom from before is visible The oxygen tank sits next
to him

CHARLIE
Well your complaints have been
heard

(MORE )

CHARLIE (CONTD)

I’ve been replaced by someone who
will no doubt have you rewrite and
rewrite and rewrite be more
objective less authentic less you
with every draft

(pause)

But

posted

Some of you saw what I
Asking you to write

something honest And the things
some of you wrote

Charlie smiles through the pain He pulls out a few printed
pieces of paper looking at them

CHARLIE (CONTD)

Kristy you wrote “My parents want
me to be a radiologist but I don’t
even know what that is”

(pulling up another)
Julian you wrote “I’m sick of
people telling me that I have
promise”

(pulling up another)
Adam you wrote “I think I need to
accept that my life isn’t going to
be very exciting”

Charlie leans back breathing He smiles wide

CHARLIE (CONTD)

You all wrote these Amazing
honest things I just
(pause)

I want to be honest with you now
Now you’ve been so honest with me

I just

Charlie pauses then tentatively moves the cursor toward the

button to turn on

his video He hesitates for a moment

taking a breath then turns on his camera

For the first time the “INSTRUCTOR” square reveals Charlie
He smiles at them giving a little wave His students all

look on silently

Charlie moves the
himself He tilts
After a moment he
smiles gently

stunned
laptop away from his body filming more of

the laptop down filming his entire body
tilts the camera back up to his face He

CHARLIE (CONTD)

These assignments--they don’t

matter

This course doesn’t matter

College doesn’t matter

(MORE)

CHARLIE (CONTD)
These amazing honest things you
wrote--they matter

Charlie pauses for a second then in one motion throws the
laptop across the room It crashes against the fridge

INT - LIVING ROOM - LATER 51

Liz stands in the front doorway staring at the broken
computer holding a bag Charlie is in the same position as
before Liz closes the door and comes further in She
retrieves the stethoscope from the medical cabinet then
approaches Charlie listening to his breathing

CHARLIE
I’m sorry

LIZ
Don’t

Liz listens for a moment longer then takes off the
stethoscope and moves away from Charlie Pause

LIZ (CONTD)

I really hate you for putting me
through this again you know that

(pause)
Those last few months before
Alan I’d come over here scream
at him shake him just trying to
get him to fucking eat something
God that was awful

CHARLIE
It was awful for me too

LIZ
Yeah well you weren’t the one who
had to identify his body All
bloated--

CHARLIE
They wouldn’t let me
(pause)
I wasn’t Family

Pause Liz stands for a moment then goes to her bag She
takes out a plastic bag filled with two sub sandwiches She
drops the sandwiches onto the couch looking at Charlie
defeated

LIZ
I got you two meatball subs Extra
cheese I don’t know what I’m
doing

Liz goes to Charlie bending down to him looking directly at
him Charlie’s breath begins to grow more shallow

CHARLIE
I’m not Going to the hospital

Liz looks at him

LIZ
I’m not asking you to
(pause)
I can’t do this anymore

Charlie’s breathing is increasingly shallow sweat pours down
his face

CHARLIE
I thought I could save him Liz
I
(pause)

I thought if I loved him enough he
wouldn’t need anything else I told
him he didn’t need God he didn’t
need anything but me

Liz goes to him looking him straight in the eye

LIZ

Charlie all I know is that you
gave Alan the best years of his
life If it weren’t for you he
would have jumped off that bridge
years earlier Nobody could’ve
saved him Believe me I spent
years trying

(pause)
I don’t think I believe anyone can
save anyone

Very softly we begin to the hear the sound of waves Charlie
smiles joy radiating from underneath immense pain his eyes
glazing over

CHARLIE
She saved him

Pause Liz looks at him confused

CHARLIE (CONTD)
She wasn’t trying to hurt him She
was trying to help him

LIZ
Who are you talking about

CHARLIE
He’s going home She did that

Liz goes to Charlie putting her hands on his head

LIZ
Charlie

CHARLIE
She didn’t do it to hurt him she
did it to send him home

LIZ
Do you feel light-headed Charlie
look at me

CHARLIE
She was trying to help him

LIZ

CHARLIE
Ellie She was trying to help him
she just wanted him to go home

Charlie looks at Liz lovingly He takes her hands smiling at
her

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Do you ever get the feeling That
people Are incapable Of not
caring People Are Amazing

Suddenly the front door opens and Ellie charges inside
holding the essay from before

ELLIE

(raging)
What the fuck did you--

She advances on Charlie but then stops when she sees the
state he’s in

ELLIE (CONTD)
What’s wrong with him

Finally Liz smiles at him nodding

Pause

Liz wraps her arms around Charlie giving him a kiss on the
forehead She slowly stands back up

LIZ (CONTD)

She heads to the front door about to open it She gives
Charlie one last look

LIZ (CONTD)

INT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 53
Ellie stares at Charlie struggling to maintain herself

ELLIE
Why did you do that

CHARLIE

Ellie holds up the essay from before

ELLIE
I failed

CHARLIE
It’s A really good essay

The waves continue to increase in volume

Ellie advances on Charlie yelling at him desperately trying
to keep herself together

ELLIE

reads the opening

She recognizes it immediately

ELLIE

I knew you would

Ellie looks at him

Pause

ELLIE
I wrote this

CHARLIE
You never Forget anything

ELLIE
I wrote this in eighth grade for
English why do you--

CHARLIE
And I felt saddest of all When I

read the boring chapters That were

only descriptions of whales

Because I knew That the author was

just trying to save us From his
own sad story Just for a little
while

ELLIE
Why do you have this

CHARLIE
Your mother She sent it to me
Four years ago I wanted to know

essay I’ve ever read

Ellie is struggling to hold on to her anger
from Charlie

ELLIE
Why are you fucking with me like

CHARLIE

Ellie is frantic doesn’t know what to do She moves a little
closer to him

ELLIE
What’s the matter

CHARLIE
Ellie

ELLIE

Ellie stops unable to bring herself to leave

ELLIE

Ellie turns back to the door

ELLIE
Fuck you

CHARLIE
Please

ELLIE

Fuck you

CHARLIE
Ellie

Just as Ellie swings the front door open she can no longer
hold her emotions back She nearly collapses into tears

ELLIE
Dad please

Ellie looks at Charlie pleading Ellie and Charlie are in
the same position as they were at the end of their first
scene together The sound of waves continues to grow louder

and louder
Ellie looks at the essay She begins to read

ELLIE (CONTD)

(reading)
“In the amazing book Moby Dick by
the author Herman Melville the
author recounts his story of being
at sea In the first part of his
book the author calling himself
Ishmael is in a small sea-side
town and he is sharing a bed with a
man named Queequeg”

Charlie looks at Ellie with joy listening to her read He
reaches up and takes the oxygen tube out of his nose Ellie
continues to read

ELLIE (CONTD)
“The author and Queequeg go to
church and later set out on a ship
captained by the pirate named Ahab
who is missing a leg and very much
wants to kill the whale which is
named Moby Dick and which is
white”

Charlie braces himself on the couch

ELLIE (CONTD)
“In the course of the book the
pirate Ahab encounters many
hardships His entire life is set
around trying to kill a certain
whale”

Wheezing heavily and with a huge amount of effort and pain
Charlie attempts to stand up
ELLIE (CONTD)
“IT think this is sad because this
whale doesn’t have any emotions
and doesn’t know how bad Ahab wants
to kill him”

Charlie continues to rise For the first time he is
standing fully erect on his own The waves increase in

volume Charlie beams

ELLIE (CONTD)
“Hes just a poor big animal And I
feel bad for Ahab as well because
he thinks that his life will be
better if he can kill this whale
but in reality it won’t help him at
all”

Charlie takes a step toward Ellie his eyes on hers the

entire time

ELLIE (CONTD)
“I was very saddened by this book
and I felt many emotions for the
characters”

Charlie takes another step

ELLIE (CONTD)
“And I felt saddest of all when I
read the boring chapters that were
only descriptions of whales
because I knew that the author was
just trying to save us from his own
sad story just for a little
while”

Charlie takes one last step The waves reach their loudest

level
For the first time Ellie smiles at Charlie
ELLIE (CONTD)

“This book made me think about my
own life and then it made me feel
glad for my--”

Charlie looks up The waves cut off

A sharp intake of breath The shot cuts out

Then
