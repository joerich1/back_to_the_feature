face to hers Lips to lips John doesnt resist but after
a few moments she realizes hes not going to engage

JOHN
Good night Eve

A kiss on her forehead He takes his pillow a blanket and
sets up a make-shift bed on THE FLOOR

Eve doesnt move at first Then using her left hand (wedding
ring prominently featured) she reaches to the bedside table
on Johns side (where we see HIS ring) Turns off the light

JOHN

named Icarus If you try to land
youll pass out crash the plane
and kill every living soul aboard

This doesnt go over well RUMORS blow up and down the aisle

CAPTAIN THORNHILL
What are we dealing with here
Laymans

JOHN
Our bodies rely on a delicate balance
of atmospheric pressure to protect
vital organs The Icarus Virus short
circuits the balance essentially
we can go up but we cant go back
down Itll start with headaches
Bloody noses An overwhelming sense
of panic The last thing we ever
feel is the agony of massive internal
hemorrhaging

CAPTAIN THORNHILL
How did this--

JOHN
--An infected man entered DIA this
morning And then we all sat there
coughing and sneezing for two hours
during a snow delay

JOHN
Thats fine You dont have to change
a thing but airplane cabins are
pressurized right How much

CAPTAIN THORNHILL
Cabin Altitudes set to 8000 feet
during cruise

JOHN
So thats what were experiencing
right now 8000 feet

CAPTAIN THORNHILL
Yes

JOHN
Is it at all possible to land with a
Cabin Altitude pressure of 8000
feet Is there a setting for that

A manual setting

CAPTAIN THORNHILL
Technically we can set it to any
altitude we want but when theres
negative cabin pressure the negative
pressure relief valve automatically
equalizes the system and the fuselage
isnt really made for--

JOHN
Can you override it

CAPTAIN THORNHILL
I guess we could pull the fuse

JOHN
Land follow orders but dont let
us experience the descent Please

CAPTAIN THORNHILL
I just had Delta run a background
check on you Doctor so Im going
to give you a very short leash As
long as the airplane and my passengers
remain safe you have until were
