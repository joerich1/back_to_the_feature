In an effort to better ourselves we

who tried to help us figure out why
we were the way we were

At this point the pan has reached the COUNSELOR an earnest
bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his
arms folded over its back

He is addressing one of the Cons

The huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting
his brow in consternation

of the bunk
BACK TO HI

his eyes

EXT TRAILER

Hi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer Ed sits on
his lap his arms around her Both are wearing sunglasses
looking at the setting sun The scene is suffused with a
warm yellow light

VOICE OVER
These were the happy days the salad
days as they say

As the sun sets the light is turning from yellow to amber
Hi and Ed watch their heads following its slow downward
arc

VOICE OVER
and Ed felt that having a critter
was the next logical step It was
all she thought about

The amber is turning to a more neutral dusky light as the
sun has set Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where
it disappeared

VOICE OVER
Her point was that there was too
much love and beauty for just the
two of us

The dusk is slipping away into darkness

VOICE OVER
»and every day we kept a child out
of the world was a day he might later
regret having missed

We are by now holding on pitch black Crickets chirp From
the darkness

ED
That was beautiful

A CALENDAR

Ed is crossing off the last day on the calendar before a day
circled in red

VOICE OVER
So we worked at it on the days we
calculated most likely to be
fruitful
INT TRAILER

Hi is wearily entering after a long day at work clutching
his lunchpail

VOICE OVER
»and we worked at it most other
days just to be sure

Ed flies into frame and leaps into his arms covering him
with kisses

TRAILER BEDROOM
In each others arms Hi and Ed roll over on the bed

VOICE OVER
Seemed like nothing could stand in
our way now

We pan with them rolling and continue off them to the night
table on which sits a framed pair of photographs of Hi
probably taken by Ed One shows him full face the other in
profile

EXT TRAILER TWILIGHT

Ed sits in a lawn chair knitting a booty Hi stands in Bermuda
shorts and an unbuttoned Hawaiian shirt hosing down the
minuscule patch of front lawn

VOICE OVER
My lawless years were behind me
our child rearin years lay ahead

DUSTY ROAD LEADING UP TO TRAILER DAY

A squad car its siren wailing kicks up dust as it roars
into the foreground

ADOPTION OFFICE

Hi and Ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agents
desk Hi wears a sport coat over his Hawaiian shirt Ed is
in her dress blues

HI
Its true Ive had a checkered past
but Ed here is an officer of the law
twice decorated
THE AGENT
Looking with a dead pan from the file to Hi

HI
»So we figure it kind of evens
out

His face still deadly neutral the agent looks back down at
the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet revealing it
to be a couple feet long

VOICE OVER
But biology and the prejudices of
others conspired to keep us childless

INT SQUAD CAR
On Ed as she stares vacantly out the passenger window

VOICE OVER
Our love for each other was stronger
than ever

ON HI
Driving He looks from Ed out to the road

VOICE OVER
but I preminisced no return of
the salad days

TRAILER BATHROOM

Over His shoulder as he stares listlessly at himself in the
mirror a razor held forgotten in one hand his face half
lathered and half shaved

VOICE OVER
The pizazz had gone out of our lives

TRAILER BEDROOM

The bedroom is somewhat messy Ed sits on the edge of the
bed also staring listlessly Her police uniform is on but
not yet buttoned Her hands lie palm-up in her lap like two
dead fish

VOICE OVER
Ed lost all interest in both criminal
justice and housekeeping Soon after
she tendered her badge

MACHINE SHOP

Once again Hi works as his sweaty gum-chewing colleague stands
idly by

VOICE OVER
Even my job seemed as dry and bitter
as a hot prairie wind

other

Alone in his Chevy He looks to the side

VOICE OVER
I even caught myself drivin by
convenience stores

HIS MOVING POV
7-Eleven

VOICE OVER
that werent on the way home

TRAILER LIVING ROOM
Hi and Ed sit listlessly watching TV

VOICE OVER
Then one day the biggest news hit
the state since they built the Hoover
Dam

Ed perks up reacting to something on TV Hi notices her
reaction and also sloughs off his stupor to watch

VOICE OVER
The Arizona quints was born

THE TV

A newscaster silently reading copy Behind him news footage
of five nurses holding infants mortices in

VOICE OVER
By Arizona quints I mean they was
born to a woman named Florence
Arizona

BACK TO HI AND ED

Watching intently Eyes still locked on the set Ed reaches
her hand out to Hi Eyes still locked on the set Hi takes
her hand in his

VOICE OVER
As you probably guessed Florence
Arizona is the wife of Nathan Arizona
And Nathan Arizona - well hell you
know who he is
THE TV A LATE-NIGHT LOCAL COMMERCIAL

NATHAN ARIZONA a stocky middle-aged man in a white polyester
suit is gesturing expansively with his white cowboy hat
toward a one-story warehouse store with a football stadium
parking lot chroma-keyed in behind him

NATHAN ARIZONA
(mixing up on the TV)
So come on down to Unpainted Arizona
for the finest selection in fixtures
and appointments for your bathroom
bedroom beaudoir

VOICE OVER
-The owner of the largest chain of
unpainted furniture and bathroom
fixture outlets throughout the
Southwest

NATHAN ARIZONA

BACK TO HI AND ED
As they slowly look from the TV set toward each other

LINE OF NEWSPAPER VENDING MACHINES

Hi lounges near one of the vending machines as a businessman
puts in a quarter

VOICE OVER
Yep Florence had been taking
fertility pills and she and Nathan
had hit the jackpot

The businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine
door as he turns to leave

Hi snags the door before it closes and takes his own five-
finger discount copy

He flips the paper over to look at the headline
FRONT PAGE OF NEWSPAPER

The banner headline of the Tempe Intelligencer is
ARIZONA QUINTS GO HOME

The subhead More Than We Can Handle Laughs Dad Next to
it is a picture of Nathan
VOICE OVER
Now yall whore without sin can
cast the first stone

A pull back from the paper shows Hi and Ed reading it together
at home They look from the paper to each other

Hi opens to an inside page and we pan a row of pictures -
the five tots with their names underneath HARRY BARRY
LARRY GARRY and NATHAN JR

VOICE OVER
but we thought it was unfair that
some should have so many while others
should have so few

BILLBOARD

In the middle of the desert It reads WELCOME TO TEMPE
POPULATION 13948 PLUS FIVE

EXT TRAILER TWILIGHT

We are floating in toward Ed who is seated waiting in the
drivers seat of His Chevy Hi enters frame and cinches
down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car Pieces of
red flag flutter at either end of the ladder where it sticks
out beyond the car

VOICE OVER
With the benefit of hindsight maybe
it wasnt such a hot idea

Hi gets in the car

FROM BEHIND THE CHEVY

It starts down the long winding road leading away from the
trailer kicking up dust

VOICE OVER

-but at the time Eds little plan
seemed like the solution to all our
problems and the answer to all our
prayers

The title of the film burns in RAISING ARIZONA A building
chord snaps off in a shock cut to

SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM EVENING
Tableau of a couple at home Nathan Arizona is on the
telephone his stocking feet up on an ottoman Florence sits

reading Dr Spocks Baby and Child Care

The living room is dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan
and Florence gazing out from the wall over the mantelpiece
NATHAN
(into the phone)
Eight hundred leaf tables and no
chairs You cant sell leaf tables
and no chairs Chairs you got a
dinette set No chairs you got dick
I ask my wife she got more sense

TITLE IS SUPERED
THE ARIZONA HOUSEHOLD

From somewhere upstairs we hear an infant start to cry
Florence stops reading and looks up at the ceiling Nathan
is oblivious

NATHAN
-Miles all I know is Im away
from the office to have me some kids
and everything goes straight to heck
I aint gonna stand for it

Another title is supered below the first SEPTEMBER 17
1985 The baby stops crying and Florences attention returns
to her book

VOICE OVER

Yeah and if a frog had wings he
wouldnt bump his ass a-hoppin Im
sick of your excuses Miles It is
now

As he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title
is supered beneath the first two 845 pm

VOICE OVER
845 in the pm Im gonna be
down to the store in exactly twelve
hours to kick me some butt

He starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an
afterthought

VOICE OVER
»Or my name aint Nathan Arizona

As he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear
Another baby starts crying Florence looks up at the ceiling

NATHAN
That sounds like Larry

Close on the crying baby as Hi bounces it gently but
desperately

HI
Shhhh Shh Nice baby

He starts to lower it back into the crib The crib is
unpainted with the name of each baby burned Bonanza-style

into the headboard Harry Barry Larry Garry and Nathan

Jr Instead of quieting as he is lowered into the crib the
squalling baby only sets off one of his brothers Hi hurriedly
lifts him back out

He looks desperately around the room
The room is wallpapered with nursery rhyme characters

There are toys strewn around There is one adult-sized easy
chair in the corner

Hi carries the baby over to the chair stepping on and
reacting to the squeal of a squeeze-me toy on the way He
sits the baby deep in - the chair and then returns to the
crib to deal with the second crying baby

He lifts the baby out of the crib and gently bounces it
This baby stops crying

Another one in the crib starts bawling

Hi sets the second baby down on the floor and gives it a
rattle to keep it pacified He reaches for the third baby in
the crib Sweat stands out on Hi s brow He is desperately

chucking the third baby under the chin when we hear a muffled
PTHUMP

He whirls to look across the darkened room

The first baby has dropped off the easy chair and is
energetically crawling away toward a shadowy corner

LIVING ROOM

Nathan and Florence are sitting stock-still staring at the
ceiling After a moment another baby starts crying

NATHAN
Whatre they playing telephone

They stare at the ceiling

NURSERY

Loose babies are crawling everywhere Hi is skittering across
the room in a half-crouch a baby tucked under one arm
reaching out with the other as he pursues a crawling baby

across the room

He hefts the other baby with his free arm and brings the air
back to the crib
He turns to look frantically around the room
The other three babies have disappeared
There is perfect quiet

Hi goes over to the closet door which is ajar and swings
it open

He reaches under a moving pile of clothes on the floor and
pulls out a baby

He returns it to the crib and freezes listening
The sound of a rattle

He drops to the floor to look under the crib
WIDE ANGLE UNDER CRIB

A baby holding a rattle leers into the camera in the
foreground Behind him Hi on his stomach is reaching in to
grab at his leg

Hi is pulling the baby out away from the camera when with
a plop a baby drops onto Hi s back from the crib above

Hi twists one arm back to grope for the baby crawling on top
of him

He is straightening up a baby in each arm when he reacts
in horror to something he sees across the room

HIS POV

The hindquarters of a diapered baby are just disappearing
around the corner of the nursery door into the hallway

LIVING ROOM

Florence and Nathan are staring at the ceiling After a beat
we hear a muffled plop on the ceiling A beat later the
bleat of the squeeze-me toy

NATHAN
Whynt you go up and check on
em

They sound restless

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

The floor-level wide-angle shot shows a baby crawling toward
the camera in the foreground Behind him in the background

just rounding the open door from the nursery yet another
baby is making a mad dash for freedom
Hi emerges from the nursery and stepping around the
background baby trots toward the baby in the foreground By
the time he reaches it the low-angle cropping shows us only
his feet and calves

CLOSE ON HI

Perspiring as he tiptoes the last two steps to the baby
HIS POV

The baby and beyond it the stairway down to the main floor
We hear footsteps approaching

BACK TO HI

He scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the
nursery

LOW-ANGLE REVERSE
The baby at the nursery door in the foreground the staircase
in the background As Hi reaches the baby we hear footsteps

climbing the stairs

His free arm comes down into frame to scoop the baby up and
out of frame just as

Florences head appears bobbing up as she climbs the stairs

She approaches the nursery still clutching the Dr Spock
book

NURSERY
As Florence enters from the hallway door

We track back into the room on her as she approaches the
crib Halfway there she freezes staring in shock

HER POV

All of the babies have been replaced in the crib but not
lying down They are seated in a row staring back at her
lined up against the far crib railing like a small but
distinguished panel on Meet the Press

looks from one to the other deadpan They seem to be waiting
for him to contribute to the conversation
Silence
Suddenly Hi slaps his knee

HI

here
Ed is getting up

HI
-Hes a scandal honey Hes a
little outlaw

As she picks up the baby

ED
Hes a good boy

HI
He aint too good You can tell by
that twinkle in his eye

ED
Dont you think we should put him to
bed

HI

Hang on honey

He is frantically reaching for a Polaroid camera

HI
Lets us preserve the moment in
pictures

ED

Just one okay

She sits down on the couch with Nathan Jr as Hi starts
screwing the camera into a tripod

ED
I gotta tell ya Ima little
scared

Absently as he sets up the camera

HI
How come is that honey

ED
Well we got a baby Hi Its an awful
big responsibility

As he peers through the lens
HI
Honey could ya slide over a tad and
raise the nipper up

As she complies

ED
I mean we never done this before and
Im kinda nervous

HI

Hi sits on the couch holding the cameras cable release He
puts his arm around Ed and smiles at the offscreen camera

Ed nestles her head against His shoulder

ED
I love you Hi

HI

ED
Youre gonna help arent ya

Through his teeth as he continues to grin at the offscreen
camera

HI
Hows that honey

ED
Give Nathan Jr a normal family
background just quiet evenings at
home together

We begin to hear distant thunder

HI
You can count on it honey

ED
-Everything decentn normal from
here on out

HI
Uh-huh

As he squeezes the cable release - FLASH - the image
momentarily freezes on Hi beaming Nathan Jr staring and

Ed looking at Hi with a little bit of concern

DARK FIELD SAME NIGHT

The rolling thunder has built to a thunderclap at the cut

and the flash of the Polaroid match cuts to lightning throwing

a momentarily harsh glare on the field

Rain beats down on the bare patch of ground we are looking
at - by now just a patch of mud

Faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more
thunder approaching then suddenly

THWACK - A head pops up out of the mud It is Gale the con
we saw in group therapy He bellows as lightning and thunder
flash and crack nearby

His head is covered with mud although the driving rain is
already starting to wash it away

We are beginning to track in an arc around Gales head who
is now struggling working to get his shoulders and arms up
out of the mud The end of the 180-degree arc and a flash of
lightning reveal way in the distance the wire-topped walls
of a penitentiary

Still bellowing as if in some primal rage Gale has gotten
his muck-covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing
down to haul up the rest of his body It comes with much
effort and with the loud sucking-popping sounds of the
fiercely clinging mud

Finally he is free

With a great cry the mud-covered man plunges his right arm
straight back down into the earth all the way up to his
shoulder He gropes intently and then apparently having
grabbed hold of something underground he starts pulling

His arm comes slowly back up out of the mud Clasped in his
hand is - a human foot

Bellowing with effort he continues to pull liberating the
foot leg torso of his companion and finally his head

As the rain starts to wash the mud off his companions head
we see that it is his friend Evelle

Both are bellowing

Mud sucks and pops

Thunder crashes

INT GAS STATION MENS ROOM

At the cut the ear-splitting thunder drops out to quiet We
hear only the muffled patter of rain and the hum of a bare
fluorescent

The two bedraggled escaped cons are standing side by side
combing their hair in the mirror The men seem absorbed in
their task using hair jelly from a jar that sits on the
shelf between them to restore their ducks-ass haircuts

Evelle cracks the bathroom door and looks out into the rain

EVELLE
»-Okay

GALE
What is it

EVELLE
Mercury Looks nice

EXT GAS STATION

The two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended
at a gas island a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank

As Gale starts up the car Evelle yanks the hose out and drops
it to the ground Gale is already starting to peel out as
Evelle gets in

WIDE SHOT TRAILER LIVING ROOM

Late at night Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of
the room in a pool of lamp light

We hear faint distant knocking As we track in toward Hi
the knocking becomes louder and more present

As we approach Hi we see that several Polaroids are spread
over his gently rising and falling chest

By the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become
quite loud

VOICE
Open up

Hi starts awake with a grunt

VOICE
»Open up in air

He looks up alarmed
HIS POV

The front door of the trailer Someone is pounding
insistently

He sits up and tenses He looks around

Ed stands in her nightgown at the mouth of the hallway
holding Nathan Jr and squinting at Hi She hisses

ED

Hi gets to his feet hurriedly tosses the Polaroids under a
cushion of the couch and takes out a gun

HI
Get in the bedroom

ED

HI

As Ed turns back to the bedroom

VOICE
Open up and maybe well letcha plea-

BEDROOM

As Ed enters and shuts the door She listens hard at the
door

His footsteps cross the living room the click of the door
opening silence a burst of raucous male laughter

HIS VOICE
-Honey Come on out here Want you
to meet a couple friends of mine

LIVING ROOM

As Ed enters carrying Nathan Jr All three men - Hi Gale

face and says under his breath

GALE

HI

HI

ED

There is an awkward silence as she leaves and slams the
bedroom door

Gale is carefully studying his thumbnail Evelle stares
fixedly at the ceiling Still looking at his thumb

GALE
Gotcha on a awful short leash dont
she H1

BEDROOM

Sometime later as Hi tiptoes in Ed lies in bed facing the
wall we see only the back of her head Hi sits gingerly on
the edge of the bed and smiling sticks a finger through
the bars of the crib to play with the baby

The sound of the TV set in the living room filters faintly
in
ED
They still here

Hi is momentarily startled then goes on playing with the
baby

HI
Yeah theyre just gonna stay a day
or two Its raining out honey they
got nowhere to go

Ed finally turns to face him We hear the two men laugh
raucously in the living room

ED
Theyre fugitives Hi

Hi turns to face her

ED
Howre we gonna start a new life
with them around

HI
Well now honey you gotta have a little
charity Ya know in Arab lands theyd
set out a plate -

ED
Promise just a day or two

HI
Tonight and tomorrow tops

EXTREME HIGH ANGLE

Looking straight down at Hi asleep in bed It is later
filtering softly in from the other room is the end of the
Star Spangled Banner on TV We are craning down

VOICE OVER
That night I had a dream

FLASH CUT
For a brief moment we see a wall of flames and hear it roar
BACK TO HI
Still craning down
VOICE OVER

Id drifted off thinkin about
happiness birth and new life
FLASH CUT
Wall of flames Deafening roar
BACK TO HI

Craning down The faint National Anthem ends we hear the
WEEEEEEEE of a test pattern

VOICE OVER
But now I was haunted by a vision of -

WALL OF FLAMES

Roaring At the cut WHOOOOOSH a huge low-rider motorcycle
bursts through the flames its engine roaring even louder
than the fire Its driver is a huge leather-clad hellion

The chains worn by the Biker clank ominously as he rides

VOICE OVER
He was horrible

The Biker roars out of frame
LOW-ANGLE REVERSE

As the Biker roars into frame his rear tire laying down a
wake of fire

VOICE OVER
a lone biker of the apocalypse

TRACKING ON BIKER
As he roars along a ribbon of desert highway

VOICE OVER
»a man with all the powers of her
at his command

The Biker reaches for his bullwhip

VOICE OVER
He could turn the day into night

The Biker cracks the whip and at the crack

The sky behind him turns instantly to black Bolts of
lightning crackle across it as thunder roars

ANOTHER DESERT SCENE DAY

Tracking with and also in on the Biker from behind as he
roars along a strip of highway He is reaching for the two
sawed-off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his
back
VOICE OVER
and laid to waste everything in
his path

REVERSE TRACK ON BIKER

Pulling the Biker from a distance as he levels the two
shotguns The tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a
running jack-rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground

VOICE OVER
He was especially hard on the little
things

CRACK - as the first shotgun spurts orange the foreground
rabbit keels over The Biker slues the other gun around

LOCKED-DOWN WIDE SHOT
On a rock in the foreground a desert lizard suns himself
The Biker is approaching in the distant background

VOICE OVER
-the helpless and the gentle
creatures

CRACK - from afar the foreground lizard is blown away
LOCKED-DOWN LOW-ANGLE WIDE SHOT

Of the empty desert road stretching away In the foreground
a lone desert flower blooms

The Biker roars into frame

VOICE OVER
He left a scorched earth in his wake
befouling even the sweet desert breeze
that whipped across his brow

As the Biker roars away the foreground flower bends with
his draft and then bursts into flame

TRACKING ON BIKER

From in front He twirls the shotguns in either hand and
reaches back to plunge them over his shoulders into their
holsters

VOICE OVER
I didnt know where he came from or
why

We are moving in on his chest where two crisscrossed
bandoliers carry two rows of hand grenades their silver
pins glinting in the sun We follow the line of one of the
bandoliers up to his right shoulder which bears the tattoo
Mama Didnt Love Me

VOICE OVER
I didnt know if he was dream or
vision

REVERSE TRACK ON BIKER

From behind booming down as we track We are approaching
the crest of a rise

VOICE OVER
But I feared that I myself had
unleashed him

HIGH SHOT
Of the Biker approaching craning down as he draws near

VOICE OVER
for he was The Fury That Would
Be

With the crane down we momentarily lose him from view over
the rise then suddenly - ROAR - he tops the rise and wheels
spinning is airborne

REVERSE

As he crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars
away Only now we are no longer in the desert

We are looking down a twilight street at the end of which is
the Arizona house

VOICE OVER
»as soon as Florence Arizona found
her little Nathan gone

The roar of his engine and clank of his chains recede as the
Biker gradually dissolves into thin air

We are left looking at the empty street and the faraway
Arizona house

The receding roar has left behind eerily beautiful singing
a woman singing a lullaby Faintly behind the singing there
is also a droning high-pitched noise

The camera starts floating forward very close to the ground
moving slowly toward the Arizona house The high-pitched
drone is becoming less faint under the singing

The camera is accelerating The drone is growing louder - we
can now tell that it is a human scream
As we approach the Arizona house we can see that a ladder is
propped up to a second-story window

We are moving quite fast now The scream all but buries the
singing

We are rushing toward the house toward the base of the
ladder the sustained scream drawing us on

We hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no
abatement of speed sucked forward by the deafening scream

We reach the top and hurtle - THWAP - through the white
curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery to
reveal Florence Arizona her back to us screaming over the
crib

We are rocketing toward her
She is turning to us hands pressed to her ears mouth
stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek and we are rushing

into an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and her wildly
vibrating epiglottis and we

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT OF HIS EYES
As they snap open

The screaming snaps off at the cut The singing that the
building scream covered however is now audible again

Perspiration beads His forehead He looks down toward the
foot of the bed

THE BEDROOM

It is now morning Ed walks back and forth gently bouncing
the baby as she walks She is singing it a lullaby

Faintly from the next room we can hear Gale and Evelle
snoring away like buzz saws

HI

(groggily)
He all right

ED
Hes all right He was just havin a
nightmare

Hi is getting out of bed

HI
Yeah well

CUT TO
He crosses to the bedroom window and cracks the venetian
blind Orange light filters in

HIS POV

Beyond a clothes line and a septic tank a huge orange ball
of sun is rising We can almost hear the roar of its burning
surface

BACK TO HI
Looking

HI
Sometimes its a hard world for
little things

HIS POV
The orange sun rumbling perceptibly rising
ARIZONA HOME FRONT FOYER

At the cut the rumble of the sun is snapped off by the high-
pitched ba-WEEEEeeee of a strobe going off as a flash
picture is taken We are looking over Nathan Jrs shoulder
as he stands at his open front door facing a battery of
press people who stand out on the porch

An obie light over a local TV news camera glares in at us
various flashbulbs pop

NATHAN

(sadly)

mama reads that shes just gonna

A POLICEMAN from inside the house is taking Nathan by the
elbow

POLICEMAN

questions sir

As Nathan allows himself to be led back into the house he
calls back over his shoulder

NATHAN
But remember its still business as
usual at Unpainted Arizona and if
you can find lower prices anywhere
my name still aint Nathan Arizona

We are following the two hand-held as the Police leads
Nathan toward the living room

LIVING ROOM

The room is filled with policemen milling about in several
different uniforms local police state troopers plainclothes
detectives

The original Policeman is leading Nathan to a table where a
white-smocked technician is preparing inkpad and exemplar
sheets

The dialogue is urgent rapid-fire and overlapping

POLICEMAN
Mr Byrum here can take your exemplars
while you talk

MR BYRUM has taken Nathans right hand and is rolling its
fingers onto the inkpad

BYRUM

Nathan jerks his hand away
NATHAN

Two men in conservative suits are approaching

POLICEMAN

He grabs the overcoat being displayed by FBI 2

NATHAN
Thats a five-hundred-dollar camels

BYRUM

Nathan realizes that hes gotten ink from his fingerprinting
all over the coat

NATHAN
Well goddamnit

He is rising to his feet and hurling the coat to the floor

NATHAN
-No leads

He furiously kicks the coat

NATHAN
Everyone leaves microbesn whatnot

Throughout the speech Nathan stalks the room working himself
into a frenzy furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters
generally cleaning up hectoring the police and swiping
their feet off his furniture

NATHAN
-Hell thats your forte trackin
down them microbes left by criminalsn
commiesn shit Thats yer whole

damn raison ditre No leads I

want Nathan Jr back or whichever

the hell one they took Hes out

there somewhere Somethin leads to
him And anyone can find him knows

the difference between a lead and a
hole in the ground

HOLE IN THE GROUND - DAY

Specifically it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth

that Gale and Evelle climbed out of We hear only the squish -
suck of many feet walking around in the mud offscreen

We are pulling back to reveal the feet-the shiny black patent
leather shoes and blue pants cuffs - becoming quickly

spattered - of several policemen milling about the hole

German shepherds sniff around also

With a roar motorcycle wheels enter frame The bikes
jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once police
step back and dogs skitter away to give him room

He backs toward the camera and stops standing astride the
bike The burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame
it hisses angrily and dies in the mud We start to crane up

The whipcracking Biker cue mixes up The Bikers motorcycle
idles with a deep rumble like the roar of fire on the sun

We are now framed looking over the Bikers shoulder The
policemens attitude to him seems to be deferential One cop
in front of him is pointing a direction The Biker is shaking
his head he doesnt think they went that way

Suddenly with a loud whipcrack effect the Bikers head
snaps to profile He is staring across the field stock-still
having heard smelled or sensed something

The dogs milling around the hole also react snapping to
attention a split second after the BIKER

THEIR POV

A jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field
THE DOGS

After a moment their attention returns to the hole

THE BIKER

His attention also returns to the matter at hand He squints
concentrating His bike rumbles Gradually his face sets in
a specific direction

We pan down to the tattoo on his shoulder Mama Didnt Love
Me His shoulder flexes once or twice as he revs the
throttle then he puts the bike in gear and it roars out of
frame

TRAILER KITCHEN CLOSE ON GALE AND EVELLE

They are both intently munching cornflakes staring at
something offscreen After a beat

EVELLE
-Awful good cereal flakes Miz
McDunnough

THEIR POV

Ed is sitting in the living room bottle-feeding Nathan Jr
She is surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by
the house guests She does not respond to the ice-breaker

been smoking in the ashtray next to him There is a bead of
milk dribbling down his chin

He takes a contemplative puff studying Ed

WIDE SHOT GAS STATION BATHROOM

It is the bathroom where we earlier saw Gale and Evelle
combing their hair now empty

We are looking toward the door The bathroom is quiet except
for the dripping sink and the faint rumble of an approaching
motorcycle It grows louder then begins to recede as the
bike shoots by the station

Suddenly we hear the screech of the bikes brakes

EXT THE STATION

We are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle
screeches to a halt in the foreground The low wide shot
crops the BIKER at his shins In the background behind him
is the gas station

The Biker pauses for a moment thinking or feeling

BACK TO INT BATHROOM

We hear the rumble of the bike approaching very loud
CRASH - the bathroom door flies open as the Biker bursts in
astride his hog bright daylight streaming in with him to
throw him into imposing silhouette The shafts of light
pouring in are defined by motes of dust dancing in the air

HIS POV

Fast track in on the jar of hair jelly sitting on the shelf
under the mirror

BACK TO BIKER

An extreme close shot shows his nostrils dilating as we hear
him sniff

He revs the rumbling bike stealing thunder from a far
mountain

FRONT STOOP OF TRAILER

Hi with Ed standing by is just opening the door to a young
couple Glen is a short stocky blond man in his early

TRAILER LIVING ROOM KITCHEN

The weaving knee-level tracking shot is following a six-year-
old boy in shorts and a dirty T-shirt as he tramps around

the trailer brandishing a big stick He strikes the walls
furniture various other objects with his stick hollering
Bam Bam-Bam with each blow

The track weaves off him and onto Hi who is bending down to
pull a couple of beers from the refrigerator He raises his
voice to make himself heard over the din of all the children

A pimply-faced lad with a paper 7-Eleven cap on his head He
is looking up from a dirty magazine reacting in horror to
something approaching

HIS POV

Hi is approaching the check-out island with a gun in one
hand the carton of Huggies tucked under the other The LEggs
stocking is pulled over his head to distort his features

EXT CAR
Ed is reading to Nathan Jr from a large picture book

She pauses for a moment listening We can barely hear a
distant siren She resumes absently but her voice trails
off

ED
and Ill blow your house in

We can definitely hear the WHOO-WHOO of the siren now and
it is definitely approaching Ed hooks an arm around the
seat and looks behind the car then looks forward

HER POV

Indistinctly visible through the semi-reflective glass are

two figures at the check-out island One is pointing something
at the other

She unstraps herself and gets out of the car

HI

But Ed is already getting into the drivers seat of the car

BACK TO ED

The car squeals out of the lot
WIDE SHOT THE STREET

The squad car tops a rise to bounce into view its siren
wailing

BACK TO THE STORE

Hi bursts out the door still wearing the stocking The carton
of Huggies is still tucked under one arm

Bellowing hopefully after his departing car

HI
Honey

We hear the SMACK-CRACK of a gunshot and glass impact but
the approaching squad car is still too far down the block to
have been the source

Hi looks around the parking lot bewildered

The wailing siren is becoming painfully loud

Hi looks behind him at the plate-glass front of the store
where a bullet pock mars the glass

HIS POV

Through the glass we see the pimply young Cashier with the
paper 7-Eleven cap pop up from behind the counter to sight
down his huge 44 Magnum for another shot The gun is so big
he uses both hands to heft it

SMACK-CRACK - the bullet kisses another hole in the glass
Hi is off and running

The squad car is screeching into the lot An officer tumbles
out of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped
He rolls on the pavement then hurriedly rights himself and

takes up a half-kneeling shooting stance

At the same time the little Cashier is emerging from the 7-
Eleven with his gun

The two bang away at His retreating figure - the Policemans
revolver popping the Cashiers Magnum booming

We hear the Policeman who is still in the car drawling over
its loudspeaker
SPEAKER
Halt Its a police warning son
Put those groceries down and turn
yourself in

TRACKING ON HI

Legs pumping panty hose still over his head its unused leg
streaming behind him like an aviators scarf The gun is
tucked into his belt the Huggies are tucked securely under
his arm

off another couple shots and then the policeman piles back
into the squad car

EDS CAR
Driving She hears distant gunshots

ED
That son of a bitch Hold on

She hangs a vicious U-turn
TRACKING ON HI
Huffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies

The cop car careens onto the street in the background its
siren wailing

The PASSENGER COP is leaning far out his window one hand
gripping the light-and-siren rack the other pointing a gun
at Hi shooting away

Bullets whizz past

Suddenly with a soft pthunk the Huggies box pops forward
out from under His arm - hit by a bullet Still running Hi
reaches forward tries to catch it on the fly bobbles it
tips it - loses it He overruns it a couple steps before he
can bring himself up short

He turns and reaches to pick up the box but - PING-PING -
bullets chew up the road near his hand

Leaving the Huggies Hi takes off through a well-manicured
yard

The police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him
around the corner the driver still drawling over his

loudspeaker

SPEAKER
Thats private property son Come
back out to the street and reveal
yourself to Officer Steensma and
Officer Scott - thats me

YARD

The camera is shooting forward at ground level following
the Doberman as it bounds along The Doberman is dragging
his chain and spike which stretch into the foreground

intersecting street

A second dog peels into the road to bound along with the
Doberman

turn to avoid the Cashier and hellhounds

Roaring up the new street they are now directly in the path
of the oncoming police car its siren wailing barreling
straight at them

into the clatter of nails on tile

INT SUPERMARKET

As Hi bursts in Tracking on him as he runs down the broad
front aisle head whipping as he runs looking up each
perpendicular lane searching for something

He turns up one of the last lanes races along it and grabs
a carton of Huggies still on the flat run

He emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it but
at the first perpendicular lane he hits we see Officer
Steensma gun leveled at the other end He fires

Hi keeps running

The Policeman is running along the front aisle keeping pace
with Hi running along the back aisle He squeezes off shots
at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity

Hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back losing the
Policeman He runs down the second lane he comes to toward
the front of the store
The pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders
up toward Hi braying at the top of their doggy lungs The
lead Doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7-Eleven cap

Hi reverses again and emerges into the back aisle

BANG A pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder

BOOM five jars of applesauce explode in front of him

Hi looks
Standing in the raised platform-cubicle at the front of the
store is the Store Manager a fat man in a white short-sleeved

shirt with a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth

The Manager cracks open his shotgun and inserts two more
cartridges - THOONK THOONK - in the smoking chamber

Roaring at the cut Through it we can see the Biker sitting
on the ground legs stretched out in front of him back
resting against his parked motorcycle arms folded across
his chest

Perfectly motionless he stares at the campfire

We are floating in toward him

As we come closer eventually drawing in to a close shot of
his face we gradually realize something peculiar about his
eyes He seems to have none Although his eyes are
unblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs but only fire -
either a reflection of the campfire or something roaring -
burning-inside

is a backwards Nathan Arizona

There is the shadow of a man approaching the door and muffled
voices

SECRETARYS VOICE
Im sorry Mr Arizona he just barged
in

The door swings open and Nathan stands looking in his middle-
aged secretary hanging at his elbow

SECRETARYS VOICE
Should I call Dewayne

Nathan is staring toward his desk
NATHAN
Hell no why wake the security guard
Ill take care a this
The secretary leaves

NATHANS POV

The Biker sits with his back to us jackboots propped lazily
on the desk

His head bobs and ducks as if he is following some movement
in the air in front of him
BACK TO NATHAN

Eyes on the Biker he slams the door shut behind him looking
for some reaction

BIKER

No reaction His head continues to bob and duck

BACK TO NATHAN

Circling the Biker as he crosses to sit behind his desk
HIS POV

Arcing around to reveal the Bikers face He still does not
react to Nathan not even bothering to give him a glance

His eyes continue to follow some phantom movement

When the Biker speaks it is still without looking at Nathan
and with a surprisingly soft voice and mild unhurried manner

BIKER
You got flies

He finally looks at Nathan and smiles faintly

NATHAN
I doubt it This places climate-
controlled all the windows are
sealed Who the hell are you

BIKER
Name of Leonard Smalls My friends
call me Lenny

He takes a drag on his cigar

BIKER
»Only I aint got no friends

NATHAN
Stop youll make me bust out crying
Listen Leonard you want some
furniture or a shitbox theyre out
on the sales floor

SMALLS is pleasantly shaking his head

SMALLS

Nathan is looking at him stonily

SMALLS

dollars Im sayin fair price For

Quick as a flash the heretofore languid Smalls bolts forward
his fist stopped an inch short of Nathans nose

EXTREME CLOSE SHOT SMALLS FINGERS

His index finger and thumb are pinched together-holding the
leg of a struggling fly that he has just plucked from the
air

SMALLS
»and the people that took him

He flicks the fly away

SMALLS
Ill kick their butts

He sits back down

SMALLS
No extra charge

Nathan stares grimly at Smalls

NATHAN
And if I dont pay

SMALLS
Oh Ill get your boy regardless
Cause if you dont pay the market

NATHAN
You wanna know what I think I think
youre an evil man I think this is
nothin but a goddamn screw job I

the one took Nathan Jr and my fine
friend I think youre the one gonna
get his butt kicked

Nathan swivels to punch numbers on a telephone

NATHAN
I think Im on the phone to the cops
right now and I-

He swivels back looking up and his speech stops short
HIS POV

The office is empty A whipcrack effect builds to the cut
and

CLOSE ON HI

His eyes snap open as the whipcrack echoes away

He has been slumped over the kitchen table asleep
GALE (0S)

broccoli magnet

There is a harsh knock at the door All three tense

GALE

He goes to the door pulls back its shade and peeks out
Under his breath

HI
Shit

He opens the door

EXT TRAILER

It is Glen He backs nervously down to the foot of the stoop
as Hi stands in the half open doorway Glen comes to rest a
few feet away from the stoop

He is wearing a neckbrace The bridge of his eyeglasses is
taped together Cotton wadding is stuffed up his nose which
is darkly discolored He holds a rolled up newspaper

His station wagon is parked behind him idling

HI
Morning Glen
Glen speaks in a very nasal voice

GLEN

HI

GLEN
Well dont even bother First off

Hi is suddenly nervous and urgent

HI

GLEN

Hi takes one step down holding out a calming hand

Glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by
resting a hand on the door of his station wagon

GLEN
Stay away from me McDunnough

Hi stops short Glen smiles

GLEN
Sure youre an awful big man
when you got somethin around to

HI
(softly)

He spits on the dirt in front of him

GLEN

Hits face is set in rigid dismay

GLEN

GLEN

He slams the door
GLEN

And the car squeals off

Hi looks back at the trailer

HIS POV

A slat in the window blind drops back into place

BACK TO HI

He opens the door

INT TRAILER

Evelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in
his arms

Hi moves toward Evelle His teeth are set he means business
HI
Whats goin on here

Gale steps in front of Hi
GALE
You know whats goin on HI Its
just business Now this can go either

hard or easy-

Hi gives Gale a hard push to get past him Gale staggers
back but recovers and grabs Hi in a bear hug

Hi flips Gale Gale lands on a coffee table which flips up
and crashes back down

Evelle is dancing back out of His reach As Hi lunges for
him the prostrate Gale grabs his legs

Hi goes down hard
Gale leaps to his feet and - CRASH - bangs his head up against
an overhanging lamp Both of his hands fly up to massage the

top of his head

THOOMP - His fist flies into frame to connect with Gales
unguarded stomach Gale doubles over clutching at his gut

Hi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands

With Gales bowed head a target in front of him Hi swings
his hands up over his head

His knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the
too - low ceiling Skin is flayed plaster crumbles

Hi grabs at his knuckles in pain Gale lunges with a mid-
body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall

Gale still on top of him reaches back to throw a punch

The reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but
doesnt stop the punch

It connects with His jaw

Gale throws another quick punch all his weight behind it
His head bobs sideways just in time and Gales fist goes
through the wall It is momentarily stuck there

Hi uses the opportunity to grab Gales one free arm with
both of his He is twisting it to make Gale roaring with
pain twist around and present his back to him

Hi climbs aboard grabbing Gales face

Gale still roaring is pulling his fist out of the hole He
grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls it tears out of
the wall and snaps free giving him a length of about two
feet

Gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too-
small space Hi is hanging on for dear life his own feet
flailing this way and that knocking over lamps and wall
fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about trying to shake him
loose Gale crashes and bounces off the walls roaring in
pain and fury

Close shots of Gales face show his features impossibly and
grotesquely contorted by His hand squeezing gripping and
clutching at it

Evelle is dancing around with the baby dodging crashing
furniture and flailing body parts

EXT WIDE SHOT THE TRAILER

At the cut Gales roaring drops out We hear the chirping of
birds and the laughter of children playing in the
neighborhood

It is a sunny day

BACK TO INT TRAILER

Gale still roars With a last mighty effort he finally swings
Hi off his body

Hi crashes against a wall and through it to land in the
BATHROOM

Amid a shower of plaster dust and lath Hi has landed
groggily against the toilet

Evelle enters now with his hands free apparently having set
the baby down somewhere

He yanks the cord off the bathroom blinds
LIVING ROOM

Hi is seated in a straight-back chair still violently
struggling but Gales arms are wrapped around him from behind

Evelle is just finishing tying off his wrists behind the
chair

No one talks there is nothing left to say
Finished Gale goes to the door and Evelle goes to the

bedroom He emerges with the baby and precedes Gale out the
door Gale slamming it behind him
Hi starts bucking and struggling weeping tears of rage and
frustration He succeeds only in tipping forward face down
into the carpet the strapped-on chair pressing down on top
of him

His profile is pressed into the carpet

Offscreen we hear the door of the trailer opening

HIS POV

At carpet level Gales shoes enter his field of vision
They stride over to a mess of debris in the corner of the
living room

OBJECTIVE SHOT

As Gale paws through the wreckage to expose the copy of Dr
Spocks Baby and Child Care He grabs the book

HIS POV

The feet walk away and leave his field of vision
CLOSE ON HI

As we hear the door slam shut with horrible finality

His mouth stretches wide He ROARS with grief and
frustration

WIDE SHOT

Moving down the road toward an oncoming car As the oncoming
car gets closer we can see Gale and Evelle in its front seat

As the car passes we pan with it to reveal that we have

been shooting from the inside of another car and we hold on
the profile of its driver Ed She has just watched the other
car shoot past

ED
Good

QUICK FADE OUT
INT DEVASTATED TRAILER

As Ed sits heavily into frame apparently in shock her frozen
profile to the camera as she stares straight ahead into space

Her foreground hand absently holds a length of cord
Beyond her in the middle background Hi is rummaging in the

debris He stands up cropped from the chest down and starts
loading bullets into the chamber of Eds 38 police special
HI
(frantically)
I know youre worried honey but

He snaps the chamber shut and leaves frame still talking

HI

-Well get him back thats just

He is walking back into frame holding another handgun now in
addition to the 38 this one an automatic

HI
-Im gonna be a better person from

He snaps a clip into the automatic

HI
-A blind man could tell you that

Hi is leaving frame again continuing to talk as we hear him
rummaging offscreen

HI
-But I aint like that no more

Hi enters frame with the two handguns stuck in his belt
holding his pump-action shotgun

Evelle beaming looks up from the baby to Gale

EVELLE
He smiled at me

THE SUN
A huge rumbling rippling red ball that fills the frame

As we hear his footfalls on concrete steps Smalls rises
into frame apparently climbing a stoop The sun behind him
throws him into silhouette the extreme telephoto flattens
him against the sun Heat waves ripple between us and him
making his figure slightly waver

The rumble builds louder and louder until it is snapped
off by a-

INT TRAILER

CLICK The front door handle clicks open and Smalls stands
in the doorway The abandoned trailer is perfectly quiet

The room is a complete shambles from the fight Sunlight
filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds Smoke
from Lenny Smalls cheroot ripples up through the light

After only a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene
Smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and
nudges some of it aside with his toe exposing a piece of
paper

He bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes with a
soft grunt of surprise

HIS POV

At knee-height on the wall in front of him FART is scrawled
in crayon

proprietor of this small mom-and-pop store) face each other
across the check-out counter Evelle has various baby
purchases - the diapers baby food etc - piled on the

Through the open door beyond them we can see a strip of the
parking lot

drops it on the counter He is looking around at the other
impulse purchases displayed by the register he unhooks a
bag of balloons

EVELLE

Gale is trotting by in the opposite direction Weeeeee

GALES FOOT

Already plunging down on the brake SQUEEEEEEEAL
TWO SHOT

Evelle is screaming at the top of his lungs as the car rocks
to a stop He peers through the windshield still screaming
but nothing has shot off the roof of the car

He cranes his neck to look up the slant of the windshield
toward the roof This of course gives him no view still
screaming he thrusts his body out his open window to look
up at the roof His scream is muted as his head disappears
from view then comes back full force as he ducks back in
frantically shaking his head

With this Gales last hope disappears and he starts bellowing
also

Rising from the brake to plunge down on the accelerator

BACK TO THE BANK
A teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags

Close on her hands we see her putting in a cash packet that
is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding
a small plastic device

The teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking
she shoves it into the sack

KA-POP With a loud flat crack something detonates in the
front seat and the interior of the car is spattered with
bright blue paint

Gale and Evelle both covered in blue are screaming in rage
fear and incomprehension Blue dollar bills snap and flutter
around the inside of the car

The car is swerving wildly as Gale drives blind the inside
of the windshield covered with blue paint He reaches forward
to wipe clear a patch of windshield

CLOSE ON NATHAN JR

Sitting placidly in his car seat that sits in the middle of
the road in front of the bank

We can hear the wail of the police siren still approaching

As we hold on Nathan Jr we hear the distant booming of a
shotgun

As we boom up to show the empty street beyond the baby we
hear the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes
The screech culminates in a loud explosion that snaps off
the siren wail The police car is apparently history

From beyond the crest of the road ahead a ball of flame has
leapt up with the explosion As the explosion echoes and

fades we hear the deep rumble of an approaching engine

Lenny Smalls motorcycle appears over the rise Framed against
fire and smoke he is coming directly toward us and the

baby

FROM BEHIND HI AND ED

As they top a rise coming from the other direction We see
the baby sitting in the middle of the street and Lenny fast
approaching from the background

LOCKED DOWN TO MOTORCYCLE

The extremely low wide shot locked down to the speeding
bike shows us rushing toward the rear of Nathan Jrs car
seat

With a clank of chains Lennys hand drops down into frame
palm forward tensing to scoop up the car seat that we are
almost upon

A tattoo on Lennys wrist reads No Prisoners

not see Lenny approaching again through the rear window

He is sawing out his second shotgun

Hi looks around reaches and pulls Ed down beneath him just
as

KA-BOOM - The second shotgun roars and the back window spits
in

As Lenny roars past the back window he casually flips
something in

Looking down the length of his own body His legs stretch
away inaV

Crashing down from a wheelie Lennys roaring bike is almost
upon him - aiming up the middle of the V

HI

He rolls As the bike is roaring by

HIS HAND

Reaches and snags a chain on Lennys passing boot
HI

Dragged several yards before the boot shakes him off leaving
him on his stomach in the middle of the road

Hi looks up the road

HIS POV

Lenny is again sluing the bike around
REAR WHEEL OF BIKE

Smoking as it skids around in the foreground completing its
turn
Boom up Lennys back to reveal Ed stomping straight up the
street toward him - unarmed unafraid

ED
I want that baby

BACK TO HI

He reaches back to pull up his shirt revealing a gun tucked
in his pants in the small of his back He grabs the gun

OVER LENNYS SHOULDER
As Ed closes in
ED
Gimme that baby you warthog from
hell

Lennys arms rise into frame With a roll of his wrists two
knives appear in his hands

BACK TO HI

On his stomach sighting down the gun toward Lenny
HIS POV

Ed stepping into his line of fire blocking Lenny
FROM BEHIND LENNY

Raising an arm to stab

Ed stoops to scoop the baby from the car seat revealing
Hi behind her He fires

LENNYS HAND
Drilled by His bullet drops its knife

The exit wound spurts not flesh and blood but a brief jet
of fire

LENNY

Quick as a flash hurling the other knife at Hi
HI

As the knife stings the gun out of his hand
KNIFE ON THE GROUND AT LENNYS FEET

Lenny bends to scoop up the knife he dropped
TRACKING BEHIND ED

As she runs toward the bank clutching Nathan Jr to her
chest

INT BANK

As Ed bursts in The floor is littered with obedient hayseeds
From where he lies prone

OLD TIMER
Just lie down on the floor missie

BANG The front door bursts open before Lennys roaring hog

It sails off a step into the sunken atrium and lands with a
CRASH amidst the hayseeds

TRACKING BEHIND ED

As she runs for the back door and pushes through it
TRACKING BEHIND LENNY

As he slaloms through the wildly scattering hayseeds

EXT BACK OF BANK

As Lenny bursts out

With a whipcrack effect he looks left then right He jerks
the bike right to where an alleyway flanks the side of the
bank

ALLEYWAY

Ed is running up the alley toward the front of the bank as
Lenny enters He roars after her

LENNYS POV

Roaring down the alley

TRACKING IN FRONT OF ED

As the bike approaches behind her
BACK TO LENNYS POV

Closing on Ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley A plank
swings into frame straight at the camera

REVERSE

Matching action as Hi finishes swinging the plank into Lennys
face
Lenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under
him

THE BIKE

Riderless twisting crazily into the street where it
collapses

HI AND ED

Lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as Hi nods
encouragement to Ed

HI
Run along now honey

Lenny is reaching back to throw his knife

Hi unaware is turning to face him presenting the plank as -
the knife is thrown

It thunks into the plank piercing it through

Hi backs up swinging the knife - studded plank to make Lenny
keep his distance

TRACKING BEHIND LENNYS SHOULDER

As he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest
shoulder

LENNYS HAND

As the free chain drops down into his palm

LENNY

Swinging the chain - WHOOSH WHOOSH - at the backpedaling Hi
THE PLANK

As the chain snakes around it and rips it out of His hands
LENNY

Grabbing Hi by the shirtfront

LENNYS OTHER HAND

Swings down and brass knuckles appear on it

ON HI

As Lennys fist swings into frame to club him forehand then
backhand

An uppercut from his heels sends Hi sprawling back
A PARKED CAR

As Hi lands against it banging his head He sinks to the
ground

Lenny is casually walking toward him lighting a cheroot Hi
flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the
car

FROM UNDER THE CAR

Hits face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape

Behind him we can see Lenny casually reaching down and
grabbing an ankle

The shot is framed identically to the shot in the Arizona
nursery where Hi pulled a baby from under the crib

Lenny pulls Hi is dragged away from the camera and out from
under the car

HI
Struggling to stand up

Lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous
bear hug

HIS ARMS

Crushed against Lenny His hands paw futilely at Lennys
chest

FULL SHOT

Lenny finally flings Hi away

HI

Landing in the dust all the fight beaten out of him
LENNY

Tired of the fight He saws out both shotguns

THE HAMMERS

On the guns as Lennys thumbs draw them back He raises the
guns to fire

HI
The end of the road

He wearily lifts a hand defensively extending it in front
of him - then stops staring at
HIS HAND
A hand grenade pin hangs glinting from one of his fingers

Pawing at Lennys chest he must have hooked his finger through
its ring

HI

Reacting

LENNY

Reacting to Hi reacting He looks down

LENNYS CHEST

On the bandoliers across his chest silver pins glint in all
the grenades - except one Its squeeze-lever juts at a right
angle from the grenade

LENNYS FACE

His jaw drops

LENNYS FEET

The lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots

HI

Scrambling to his feet

LENNY

Trying to drop the shotguns to free his hands In his panic
his fingers tangle in the trigger guards

HI

Starting to run

LENNY

Finally freeing his hands

HI

Diving behind the parked car
LENNYS CHEST

His hands fly in to wrap around the grenade - too late -
bright light
LENNY

Blows sky-high There is a roar as if the earth were cracking
open and flame as if hell were slipping out

We pan the fire to the sky
FADE OUT

A white aluminum ladder rises up into the blackness clanking
softly The top of the ladder arcs toward the camera

JUMP BACK

To the interior of the Arizona second-story nursery as the
ladder comes to rest against the window frame

It is late at night the nursery is dark and empty
THE HEADBOARD

Of the unpainted crib with the burned-in names Harry Barry
Larry Garry and Nathan Jr

As we pull back from the headboard Eds arms are gently
depositing the sleeping Nathan Jr into the crib Hi puts
the singed copy of Dr Spocks Baby and Child Care next to
the baby

REVERSE

Hi and Ed looking sadly down at the baby

The silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze-me toy as
the lights are snapped on Hi and Ed turn startled

NURSERY DOORWAY

Nathan stands in his jammies hair disheveled holding a gun
and squinting against the light

Keeping the gun trained on Hi and Ed he slowly raises a
pair of eyeglasses to his nose

NATHAN
The hell is goin on

He advances cautiously into the nursery gesturing with his
gun

NATHAN
Get away from there

Hi and Ed back away from the crib

Nathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment
He lays the gun down tenderly picks up the baby and holds
him to his chest A tear forms at the corner of his eye

Hi and Ed are quietly moving back towards the ladder

NATHAN
(sharply)
Waitaminute
Hi and Ed Stop
NATHAN

»I aint through with you Whatre
you doin creepin around here in
the dark You in with Smalls

HI
-Scuse me

As he bounces the baby studying Hi and Ed

NATHAN
Leonard Smalls big fella rides a
Harley dresses like a rock star

HI
No sir thats who we saved him from
Its a long story

NATHAN
Suppose you tell it

HI
Well sir in a re-ward situation
they usually say no questions asked

NATHAN
Do they

Hi shrugs
Nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib

NATHAN
-All right boy I guess you got a
re-ward coming Twenty thousand
dollars

He turns around with a thought

NATHAN
-Or if you need home furnishings
I can give you a fine of credit at
any of my stores Fact thats the
way Id rather handle it for tax
reasons
HI
Well-

Nathan throws his hands up in the air

NATHAN
But its up to you

HI
Tell you the truth I think wed

ED
We dont want no reward

Hi does a small take surprised at this much integrity

ED
We didnt bring him back for money

NATHAN
Well we could work it that way too

ED
Could I just look at him a little
bit more

She stands looking into the crib Hi steps up next to her
and puts an arm around her shoulder

NATHAN
Be my guest young lady but would
you mind tellin me exactly how you-

Ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib Hi murmurs
something to comfort her

Nathan is studying the two of them

NATHAN
»-You took him didnt you Wasnt
that biker atal

Hi turns to face him He speaks in a rush

HI
I took him sir my wife had nothin
to do with it I crept in yon window

ED
(still crying)
We both did it We didnt wanna hurt
him any I just wanted to be a mama

HI
It wasnt for money or nothin We

NATHAN

HI

ED

NATHAN

Aw bullshit Just tell me - just

ED

Nathan looks at her Finally he nods and sighs

NATHAN

»Well lookit If you cant have

HI

He indicates Ed with a nod of the head

HI
Her point of view is were both
kinda selfish and unrealistic so we

NATHAN
Well maam I dont know much but I
do know human beins You brought
back my boy so you must have your
good points too Id sure hate to
think of Florence leavin me - I do

He clears his throat and turns to the door His tone is harder
again

NATHAN
»You can go out the way you came
in
He snaps off the lights

NATHAN
-And before you go off and do
another foolish thing like busting
up I suggest you sleep on it

He has disappeared into the hall We hear his voice receding

NATHAN
at least one night

HIGH SHOT

Looking straight down at Hi asleep in the trailer bedroom
We start to crane down

VOICE OVER
That night I had a dream

EXTREME WIDE SHOT

A beautiful dusk landscape We are floating in over the field
abutting the prison that Gale and Evelle popped out of

In the middle background of the extreme long shot two men
are walking across the field

VOICE OVER
I dreamt I was as light as the
ether a floating spirit visiting
things to come

BACK TO HIGH SHOT BEDROOM
Craning down toward Hi

VOICE OVER
The shades and shadows of the people
in my life wrastled their way into
my slumber

BACK TO FIELD

Still floating forward but now much closer to the two walking
men We see that they are Gale and Evelle Both are still
dyed blue

They are approaching the hole in the ground

VOICE OVER
I dreamt that Gale and Evelle had
decided to return to prison

Evelle is starting to climb into the hole
VOICE OVER
-Probably thats just as well I
dont mean to sound superior and
theyre a swell couple guys but

Evelle has disappeared and Gale starts climbing in

VOICE OVER
»-maybe they werent ready yet to
come out into the world

FLOATING UP THE WALK OF THE ARIZONA HONE
The front door has a holly wreath on it

VOICE OVER
And then I dreamed on into the
future to a Christmas morn in the
Arizona home

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO

ARIZONA LIVING ROOM

Five three-year-olds in their pajamas are opening presents
around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on

VOICE OVER
-where Nathan Jr was opening a
present from a kindly couple who
preferred to remain unknown

We have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the
wrappings off a package marked to Nathan Jr Inside is a
shiny red plastic football

FLOATING IN TOWARD A STATION WAGON

Pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert
a police motorcycle parked behind it Glen is leaning out
the drivers window of the car talking to the state trooper
who stands facing him

VOICE OVER
I saw Glen a few years later still
havin no luck gettin the cops to
listen to his wild tales about men
Ed

Glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front
of him as when he told Hi about the Pollack who almost
stepped in the pile of shit

The trooper in crash helmet and dark sunglasses is listening
tight-lipped and stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and
slaps his knee
VOICE OVER
Maybe he threw in one Pollack
joke too many

The trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching
his citation book from his breast pocket The name tag on
the pocket says SGT KOWALSKI

VOICE OVER
-I dont know

FLOATING IN TOWARD A FOOTBALL
It sits on a tee in the middle of a football field

VOICE OVER
And still I dreamed on

A cleated foot boots the football out of frame

VOICE OVER
further into the future than Id
ever dreamed before

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYER

Looking up arms out at his sides waiting to receive the
kicked ball

VOICE OVER
-Watching Nathan Jrs progress
from afar

He catches the ball and starts running

VOICE OVER
Taking pride in his accomplishments
as if he were our own

He is skillfully eluding and stiff-arming tacklers

VOICE OVER
Wondering if he ever thought of
us

He reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football

He whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the
rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser

VOICE OVER
»and hoping that maybe wed
broadened his horizons a little
even if he couldnt remember just
how theyd got broadened
BACK TO BEDROOM
Still craning down now very close to the sleeping Hi

VOICE OVER
But still I hadnt dreamt nothin
about men Ed Until the end

DISSOLVE THROUGH TO
A COUPLE

The man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground
with their backs to the camera They are in the living room
of Hi and Eds trailer which is suffused with a warm golden
light

As they face the trailers front door all we see of the
couple is the backs of their heads They both have white
hair the womans pulled into a bun The old man wears a
cardigan the woman a shawl

VOICE OVER
And this was cloudier cause it
was years years away

The front door bursts open Two young couples are entering
as their kids - about a dozen of them - stream in around
them

The old couple on the couch raise their arms to embrace their
visitors The children boil onto the couch

VOICE OVER
-But I saw an old couple bein
visited by their children - and all
their grandchildren too And the old
couple wasnt screwed up and neither
were their kids or their grandkids
And I dont know you tell me This
whole dream was it wishful thinking
Was I just fleein reality like I
know Im liable to do

FLOATING IN TOWARD A LONG DINING TABLE

In the trailer The table is all laid out with a Thanksgiving
dinner a huge turkey sitting at the far end

Cut-out letters at the other end of the room say WELCOME
HOME KIDS

The grandchildren are running into frame and taking their
seats at the table accompanied by their parents

VOICE OVER
-But men Ed we can be good too
The elderly couple enter from either side of the camera and
stand in the foreground backs to us facing the table

VOICE OVER
And it seemed real It seemed
like us And it seemed like well
our home If not Arizona then a
land not too far away where all
parents are strong and wise and
capable and all children are happy
and beloved I dunno maybe it was
Utah

The elderly man drapes an arm around his wifes shoulder and
draws her close She rests her head against his shoulder

and we

FADE OUT

THE END
