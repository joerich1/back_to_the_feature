Z (OS)

(over a dark screen)
All my life Ive lived and worked in
the big city

We see
EXT AN ANT MOUND - DAY

The camera swoops towards the entrance then dives inside
past a couple of tough-looking soldier ants who stand at the
gates of the ant colony like insect bouncersinto an access
tunnel that snakes this way and that past a row of ants
plodding along

and into the MAIN CHAMBER of the colony a huge teeming
vista that seems to stretch away forever filled with ants
rushing here and there on their business We see -- a
traffic cop directing foot traffic waving his arms like
crazy so both sides move at once -- a column of soldier ants
marching along in formation -- a chain of ants letting down
a matchbox elevator filled with workers

Z (VO)
-which is kind of a problem since
Ive always felt uncomfortably in
crowds

INT MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLORS OFFICE - DAY

We join Z a worker ant with issues Hes lying on a couch
recounting his woes

Z

I feelisolated Different Ive
got abandonment issues My father
flew away when I was just a larva
My mother didnt have much time for
mewhen you have five million
siblings its difficult to get
attention

(pause)
I feel physically inadequate -- Ive
never been able to lift more than ten
times my own weight Sometimes I
think Im just not cut out to bea
worker But I dont have any other
options I was assigned to trade
school when I was just a grub The
whole system justmakes me
feelinsignificant

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
(enthusiastic)
Terrific You should feel
insignificant

For the first time we see the ant MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Hes a mixture of Tony Robbins and Ron Popiel (the
hyperactive late-night TV huckster and founder of Ronco)

Z
I should

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
(hopping around
enthusiastically)
YES You know people ask me
Doctor why are you always happy
And I tell them its mind over
matter I dont mind that I dont
matter Do you get it Do you get
it

Z gives a fake smile

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
(incredibly up)
Z were part of the fastest growing
species in the whole world

The counsellor rolls down a chart from the wall An arrow
shows ant population going up up up

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Ask me why were so successful

Z
Why are we so successful

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Im glad you asked me that question

The motivational counsellor opens some blindsand we see a
vista of the ant-filled chamber below

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
What do you see out there

Z
Ants

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Right Ants Millions of creatures
each with his assigned task all
pulling together

Down below we see a group of ants carrying a boulder up an
incline One worker ants slips and the boulder rolls down
crushing his leg The other ants rush over -- it looks like
theyre going to help their fallen comrade but instead they
climb right over him and pick up the boulder continuing
with their task

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
You see Being an ant is being able
to say “Hey -- Im meaningless
youre meaningless

Z
But -- but Ive always felt life was
about finding meaningand then
sharing it with someone special
someone you love

The motivational counsellor puts his arm on Zs shoulderhe
seems to understand

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Zyou need help
(looking at a clock)
Whoops Were gonna have to stop
there Your minute is up

The counsellor ushers Z out of his seat and towards the door

MOTIVATIONAL COUNSELLOR
Now back to work Weve made real
progress Remember -- lets be
best superorganism we can be

INT EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

A gigantic tunnel with the size and scale of the Chunnel
A banner strung overhead reads The Mega-Tunnel -- Tunneling
Our Way to a Bright Future Along the walls hang 50s work-
incentive style posters with messages like You asked for
it you got it -- more work and TWO MEALS A WEEK IS
ENOUGH Line after line of ants is working on the tunnel
digging passing clumps of dirt from ant to ant everyone
synchronized

CLOSE on a clump of DIRT being passed from hand to hand
PULL OUT TO REVEAL

AZTECA a feisty cynical female worker ant who stands
there waiting to pass the dirt on Z is daydreaming behind
her with clumps of dirt starting to pile up in front of him

AZTECA
Hello Earth to Z You better snap
out of it or theres gonna be a lot
of pissed off ants

Z looks back and sees the ants behind staring at him angrily

Z

(snapping out of it)

Sorry Azteca Here you go fellas
Fresh dirt Alley oop

(looking at the dirt)
Shouldnt we be wearing gloves I
mean this dirt is verydirty
Doesnt anyone think of hygiene

(Zs stomach growls)
Boy am I hungry Im so hungry Im
seeing double It looks like theres
two million ants in here Whens
lunch Tomorrow or the day after

AZTECA
(sweetly)
Z old pal
(shouts)
SHUT UP Its bad enough theres

a food shortage without you
complaining about it every day

Z
The squeaky wheel gets the oil

AZTECA
No Z The squeaky wheel gets thrown
away alright Youre a good ant 2Z
even though you are a pain in my rear-
segment I dont wanna see
anything happen to you So quit
mouthing off before you get in
trouble

A WHISTLE BLOWS

Z
Thank goodness Breaktime

All the ants put down their tools A beat Then the WHISTLE
BLOWS AGAIN All the ants pick up their tools again

AZTECA
(resigned)
Breaks over

Z
(getting back to work)
This colony needs another tunnel like
a hole in the ground Why are we
even digging this thing

AZTECA
Who cares Z All I know is we
gotta dig Were not the ones in
charge

INT TOWN CENTER - DAY

The huge spacious main chamber of the colony Looming over
the scene is the royal palace which seems to be
inaccessible perched on top of a hill-like pedestal

Around the base of the pedestal a crew of workers loiters
seemingly aimlesslycan these be the only unemployed ants
in the place

GENERAL FORMICA
STAIRS

The workers look up and GROAN Then they start forming a
stairway with their own bodies linking arms stepping on
each others shoulders Its extremely unpleasant work One
ant is a little tardy and just manages to get in place
before

GENERAL FORMICA the Pattonesque military leader of the
colony STEPS ON HIS HEAD using it as the first step as he
ascends to the palace his aide-de-camp Carpenter in tow As
Formica mounts the stairs we can hear the workers going
OUCH OOF YIKES etc

GENERAL FORMICA
Cut the chit-chat down there
(turning to Carpenter)
Weve spoiled these workers
Carpenter Theyve never had it so
good and listen to them -- always
grumbling and complaining

Formica steps on the foot of one of the stairway ants who
muffles a yelp

CARPENTER
Yes sir

GENERAL FORMICA
What have they got to complain about
Three square meals a day

CARPENTER
Actually sir weve cut them down to
three roughly rectangular meals a
week

FORMICA
Dont give me statistics Carpenter
I know what Im talking about DOORS

Formica and Carpenter have reached the top of the staircase
There the two guard ants on either side of the massive
throne room doors pull them open -- and one door hinge
SQUEAKS
FORMICA
(to guard ant while
passing)
Oil that soldier

INT THRONE ROOM - DAY

The QUEEN is on her throne

her

Formica salutes and marches to her

Note

Throughout this scene
repeatedly

QUEEN
Ah General Formica

short Happy Birthday fanfare on his trumpet

bring each baby to the Queen for inspection
The midwives put the babies on a moving bassinet-
powered by ants on a treadmill

QUEEN
General the severe food shortage
that faces the colonypains me
The thought of any of my children

(she shudders then
to baby)
Whos the cutest widdle worker You
are Yes you Dont forget to
brush your teeth
(to mid-wife)
Ship er out
(back to Formica)
What steps are you taking to remedy
the situation

FORMICA
We are launching a major offensive to
expand our foraging territory

QUEEN
Yes what else

FORMICA
Please dont worry your majesty
Leave the worrying to me As you
know Im not an ant of half-
measures I dont pussyfoot around
This crisis is my number one

her huge abdomen sprawled behind

Carpenter behind him

the Queen is giving birth
Each birth is accompanied by a herald playing a

Mid-wife ants

who COOS a few
priority and I promise you its
being dealt with swiftly and
decisively

The Queens attention is interrupted by another baby being
put in her arms

QUEEN
(to baby)
No snacking between meals Off you
go
(to Formica)
Now -- what were we saying

FORMICA
(Oliver North-style)
I do not recollect your majesty
Will that be all

QUEEN
Yes General Formica Carry on my
good man I dont know what we would
do without you

Formica clicks his heels and bows his head Carpenter bows
low Formica smartly about faces --

BALA (0S)
General Formica

PRINCESS BALA hurries through a second doorway carrying a
swatch book Something about her sets her apart from the
HANDMAIDEN ANTS with her Her tiara probably

Formica tilts his head quizzically to Carpenter behind him

CARPENTER
(sotto)
Princess Bala sir Your fiancee

FORMICA
Princess You look -- outstanding
s there anything I can do for you

BALA
Well -- I thought -- since were
getting marriedit might be nice if
wegot to know one another

Formica looks confused

QUEEN
Bala has always been a hopeless
romantic General

BALA
Its just that -- well Im honored
that you selected me and everything
I just thought the marriage might go
a little more smoothly if -- we had
a conversation

FORMICA
(uncomfortable)
Conversationyeswell
(to Carpenter)

Wasnt she briefed

QUEEN

(holding up a baby)
Look General A darling baby
soldier

(emotionally to baby)
Dont try to be a hero Just make
sure you come back in one piece

(handing it off)
Next

FORMICA
(using the
interruption)
Ill take your suggestion under
advisement Princess In the
meanwhile --

Formica turns to go

BALA
General -- we have to talk sometime

FORMICA
Very well Carpenter is there a
convenient time to talk vis-a-vis
relationship

CARPENTER
Actually sir were ahead of
schedule We have thirty-six seconds
available right now

FORMICA
Outstanding Princess

Balas a little fazedbut grabs her chance
BALA
So umhow was your day What did
you do

FORMICA
(scouring his mind)
Well
(thats it)
I declared war

BALA
(sadly)
Ohand I was afraid we had nothing
in common

CARPENTER
(under his breath)
Fourteen-fifty hours sir

FORMICA
Duty calls

He strides across the floor Bala watches him go her
antennae drooping unhappily

FORMICA
No squeak Outstanding

We see through the now-open doors into the throne-room as
Formica and Carpenter double-time out of the frame

The Queen sees that Bala is unhappy

QUEEN
(sympathetically)
I felt the same way before I got
married Confused Scared

BALA
(hopefully)
You did
QUEEN
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted

out all those messy feelings The
wonderful thing about ant life is
that everything is arranged Even
marriage Youre lucky -- General
Formica is a paragon of anthood

BALA
(unconvinced)
Yeshes wonderful

The doors swing shut on them -- revealing the two guard ants
who were CRUSHED in the wake of Formicas exit

INT BALAS QUARTERS - DAY

Bala enters followed by her handmaidens who are in a state

of giggling infatuation over Formica
she leafs through a wedding catalogue

HANDMAIDEN 1
(swooning over
General Formica)

Bala is scowling as

The Generals body segments are

symmetrical

HANDMAIDEN 2
(giggling)

Id let him order me into battle

anyday

Bala hurls the swatch book against the wall

HANDMAIDEN 1
Princess Whats wrong

BALA

Wrong How could anything be wrong
Im going to marry General Formica
and be a queen and have millions of

babies just like my mom
(concerned)
Do I look fat to you

HANDMAIDEN 2
(knowingly to
Handmaiden 2)

Pre-wedding jitters

HANDMAIDEN 1

BALA

someplace different

HANDMAIDEN 2
There isnt anyplace else --
(making a joke)

fq

You just need to blow off some steam
Lets go to the bar at the Royal Club

The Clubs so stuffy I want to try
Except the worker bar

BALA
The worker bar Yes Thats where
I want to go

The handmaidens look shocked

HANDMAIDEN 1
But -- we cant -- therell be
workers there

INT ANT BAR - NIGHT

A long bar filled with ants The bar itself seems to stretch
for miles and there are hundreds of ants trying to get a
drinkunfortunately theres only one bartender Z is at
the bar with WEAVER a burly ant soldier

Z
We declared war again
(off Weavers nod)
Are you scared

WEAVER
(shrugs)
Ill be back

The BARTENDER a grizzled veteran slaps down what looks like
a couple of large green beer mugs Actually theyre aphids
little green critters he fills up from a number of kegs
hanging from the ceiling The kegs are specialized ants with
hugely distended stomachs which spray liquid into the aphids

APHIDS
(as theyre slapped
on bar)
Ouch Ouch

BARTENDER
Two aphid beers

Z
(as Bartender leaves)
Did you see that How he gave you
the beers not me Im telling you
hes got something against workers

WEAVER
I dont know what youre talking
about Z
Z
Come on -- everybody dumps on us
workers You soldiers get all the
glory Plus you get to go out into
the world meet interesting insects
and kill them

WEAVER

Yeah but you get to spend all day
with those fabulous worker babes

We can see that Weaver is eyeing a nearby table of Worker
Babes including Zs friend Azteca

Z
Weaver theyre career girls
Theyre obsessed with digging

(sighs)
No Ill probably never meet the girl
for me
WEAVER

Who said there was a girl for you
I was talking about a girl for me
(quaffing his aphid

beer)
Dont you want your aphid beer

Z
I cant help it I have a thing
about drinking from the anus of
another creature Call me crazy

WEAVER
Z weve known each other a long
time right

Z
Of course You were born two seconds
after me

WEAVER
And all the time Ive known you
youve been grumping and groaning
You should quit making waves Go
with the flow

Z
Weaver Im an insect not a liquid

Down the bar theres a commotion A grizzled old SCOUT ant
has had too much to drink
DRUNK SCOUT
Have you been to Insectopia Have
you No ya goddam larvas But I
have —
(becoming emotional)
-Mosquitos n caterpillars n

beetles -- all livin in peace
stuffin their guts with foodNo

(howling drunkenly)
Its Insectopia Insectopia

Z
Hey Weaver listen

DRUNK SCOUT

I was cut off from my unit -- found
it by mistake --

(slurring)
It changed my life

(spraying another

soldier with saliva)
You see -- ya follow the great yellow
egg and you come to the land of red
and white --

SOLDIERS
Youve had enough for one night
Come on Gramps before you get in
trouble

The soldiers pull him from the bar carrying him out

Z
(excited)
Hey did you hear what he said

WEAVER
Poor guys had one too many scouting
missions

MUSIC STARTS UP
INT ANT BAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Princess Bala is peering in at the entrance to the ant bar
accompanied by her worried-looking handmaidens

HANDMAIDEN 2
We shouldnt be doing this -- it
isnt proper

BALA
Im the Princess arent I

HANDMAIDEN 2
Of course --

BALA
And do Princesses do improper things

HANDMAIDEN 2
Of course not --

BALA
Then if I go to the worker bar it
isnt improper Anyway dont worry
No one will recognize us in our
disguises

She adjusts her disguise a hardhat tied down Jackie 0-
style with an ants version of a Chanel scarf

BALA
Im just a common worker cooling off
after a rough day

Music starts An ant BARKER takes the mic at one end of the
dance floor

BARKER
(on loudspeaker)
Okay folks Its six-fifteen and
that means its time to dance

Every ant gets up to dance Weaver turns to Z

WEAVER
(draining his beer)
Time to cut a rug Z

Z
Im not in the mood
(disgusted)
Even when theyre off work they
follow orders

WEAVER
Well you just sit here and be a
party-pooper

Weaver joins the rest of the ants who are lining up for the
dance The Barker calls out the steps in a bored monotone --
all the ants already know the steps Everyone dances in
perfect synch

BARKER
(southern twang)
And a left-right-quarterstep-back
step-halfstep -- a left-right-
quarterstep-backstep-halfstep --
a left-right-quarterstep-backstep
halfstep --

AT THE ENTRANCE Bala smiles mischievously at her handmaidens

BALA
Im going to ask one of these
mindless primitive worker-types to
dance with me

HANDMAIDEN 1
But General Formica would be furious

BALA
(enjoying the idea)
I know

The handmaidens are appalled Bala whirls away from them
sets her sights and searches the crowd -- zeroing in on --

Z whos watching the other ants dance

Z
What a bunch of losers Mindless
zombies capitulating to an oppressive
system --

BALA
Wanna dance

Balas standing right there 2Z is instantly smitten

Z
Me Yes I mean --
(regaining suavosity)
Just let me finish my beer

Not breaking eye contact with Bala Z smiles suavely
Reaches suavely for a beer Suavely grabs the candle ina
glass jar off the bar Suavely singes his face

He plays it off with a rakish little laugh A bit
apprehensive Bala heads onto the floor 2Z follows her
Z
So uh -- how come I havent seen you
around here before

BALA
(covering up)
I work in the palace I dont get out
much

Z
The palace hunh I bet those royals
really live it up Of course theyre
all a little you know from
inbreeding --

BALA
(shocked)
What

Z and Bala step onto the dance floor with the rest of the
ants but Z cant do any of the steps

Z
Now lets see I -- its been a
while since I -- I think you --

Bala watches Z trying to follow along Its the blind
leading the blind as Z tries in vain to follow the barkers
rapid instructions

Z
Here Ill lead

Z starts doing his own individual dance With a suave
expression on his face he leads Bala in a helter-skelter
mixture-of Tango Charleston and hand-jive

BALA
Are you sure this is a real dance

Z
Well actually uh -- Im sort of
making it up --

BALA
(surprised)
Really

Z
Why should everyone dance the same
way Its as exciting as watching
fungus grow

BALA
Youre right

Z
(surprised)
You -- you think Im right

BALA
Why cant I just do whatever I want
to do Why cant I just go wild
Yahoo

Bala starts to get into it making up her own steps in reply
to Zs loosening up having fun For a moment the two of
them are actually sexy together Then they get a little too
wild -- and the other ants who are still doing their
intricate dance start to collide with Bala and Z 2Z almost
knocks over a big soldier ant We can only see the ants
back at the moment

SOLDIER
Hey Watch your step worker

Z has turned around to see the soldier ant MAJOR MANDIBLE
glaring at him Mandible is about twice Zs size Hes got
one eye missing and half of his left antenna his been chewed
off

BALA
You watch yours soldier or my
worker friend will beat you up

Z

(terrified)
Oh thats okay Ill let him off
this time

(whispering to Bala)
Are you crazy This guys built like
a pebble

(ineptly trying to

placate the soldier)
You know they do great prosthetic
antennas nowadays --

BALA
Arent you gonna stand up for
yourself

Zs caught between a rock and a hard place He doesnt want
to get beaten up but on the other hand he doesnt want to
lose face in front of Bala More soldiers have gathered
around looking hostile

SOLDIER
How come you dont dance like the
rest of us

Z glances over at Bala Then shaking with nervousness he
says defiantly

Z
Because -- because Im an individual

SOLDIER 2
An individual Never heard of it

MANDIBLE
You look like a worker to me

WEAVER
Hey lay off my little buddy

Z meanwhile looks far away ecstatic as if hes just
realized something very important Unfortunately just at
this moment A soldier pushes WeaverWeaver pushes him
backsomebody makes a dive for Z -- and before you know it
theres a regular bar brawl going on with Weaver in the
middle of it cracking heads together punching ants in the
face having a great time Just then the Princess
handmaidens hurries over

HANDMAIDEN 1
Princess Bala Princess Bala

Z whos scrabbling around on the floor overhears

Z
Princess Youre a Princess

HANDMAIDEN 2
The police are coming

BALA
Uh oh
(to Z)
Goodbye Gotta run

Z
Wait When can I see you again

BALA
Let me think Hmmnn
(thinks)
Never Bye

Bala rushes off with her handmaiden
whistle-blowing POLICE wade into the

Z
Wait Princess Wait

just before a squad of
crowd

But shes already gone leaving Z holding her scarf

INT DORMITORY - THE NEXT DAY

Z is talking to Weaver whos getting ready to go off to war

Cut TO

Nearby columns of ant soldiers march by

WEAVER

Get real Z She just dropped the

scarf by accident

Z

Are you kidding There were sparks
between us This scarf is a sign

WEAVER

Its a sign that youre crazy Do

impersonating a soldier is

Z

place for the royal inspect

sees me -- bingo Love is

rekindled

and she takes me up to the palace for

(wags his eyebrows
suggestively)

tea and crumpets and you take your
place again and go march around to

Weaver looks unconvinced

Z

You have to help me Please Weaver
Think of all the things Ive done for

you

WEAVER
(thinks)
I cant think of any

Z
(pause)

Well Im gonna start doing things for
you

WEAVER

girls

Z

WEAVER

it)

Weaver hands Z has helmet

(overjoyed)
Youre a real buddy

WEAVER
(sourly)
Yeah I know

Z

WEAVER
Dont tell anyone youre a worker

come right back after the inspection

Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation
Z
(overjoyed)

Thanks I owe you

Z skips off and joins the column marching in time with the
soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little
INT TOWN CENTER - NIGHT

The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a
reviewing stand We can hear the murmuring of thousands of
soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant
General pointing right at the camera The poster reads
GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey

Z turns to some of the soldiers near him

Z
Any of you guys know when the
Princess will show up Shes kind of
a personal friend

The soldiers look at Z like hes nuts

LOUD VOICE
ATTEN-SHUN
MARTIAL MUSIC sounds and we hear thousands of ant feet as
they snap to attention 2Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly

GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen slapping
his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some
unfortunate insect)

FORMICA
First of all let me make one thing
clear Nobody ever won a battle by
thinking for himself All this
thinking stuff is a load of crap
If the almighty had wanted you boys
to think he wouldnt have given you
huge mandibles and a brain so small
youd misplace it if it wasnt
trapped inside your head

In the audience Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formicas
just made a joke

Z
(slapping his thigh)
Trapped inside your head -- thats

a good one --
Z notices nobody else is laughing He stops

Z
Geez -- tough room
From the stage Formica is squinting at the audience trying
to make out who was laughing but there are just too many
ants He continues

FORMICA

(striding back and

forth)
We ants survive as a species because
we do what were told We survive
because we work together as one we
get the job done we do whatever it
takes to persevere

(dramatic pause)
Hell were not an army of
antswere one giant ant with
giant fists and giant jaws

The soldiers CHEER Z CHEERS along with the rest of them

Z
(to the soldier ant
next to him)
Lays it on a little thick doesnt
he If you ask me hes one giant
bore

FORMICA
Now Ive heard a lot of scuttlebutt
about a food shortage Well you boys
are gonna be taken care of But in
the meantime were gonna eat the
enemy for breakfast we are gonna
eat the enemy for lunch and we are
gonna eat the enemy for dinner

Z
Geez and I forgot my toothbrush

FORMICA
(reflective moment)
Dammit Im proud to be an ant
(he looks out at his
army)
And I know each and every one of you
boys will do your duty Dismissed

Z applauds and whistles as the other ants look at him in
confusion

Z
(clapping)
Bravo Bring on the Princess
COLONEL
Stow the gab there soldier Lets
move ‘em out

The soldiers turn to the right and start to march out past
the reviewing stand

A COLONEL marches at the head of Zs column as Z looks around
for the Princess

COLONEL
Eyesleft

Finally as Zs part of the army marches past the end of the
reviewing stand he sees her looking bored standing next
to the Queen who is giving the royal wave

Z
(waving)
Princess Princess Bala Hey Its
me Z Ive got your scarf
ON THE REVIEWING STAND Bala sees Z -- that is to say she

sees one of the thousands upon thousands of ants marching
by

BALA
(peering out)
Who is that idiot

QUEEN
Darling you must encourage the
troops -- wave

Bala waves unenthusiastically little more than flopping her
hand back and forth on her wrist

Down below Z takes this as a sign that Bala has seen him

Z
(excited)
Excuse me guys -- Thats my date
Well its been fun Have a great

war

Z tries to squeeze his way back towards the royals but hes
surrounded by a solid wall of soldiers -- and theyre
carrying him along with them

Z
Hey Wait
Z loses sight of the Princess as hes carried away
BARBATUS a hard-as-nails grunt soldier ant taps Z on the
shoulder

BARBATUS
You new kid

Z
I just joined up But Im quitting
I got a trial membership

BARBATUS
Trial membership Kid when you join
this ants army youre in for the
full hitch

At that moment Z is swept out of the cramped corridor
theyve been marching along as the army emerges into the
OPEN AIR outside of the colony

EXT ANT MOUND - NIGHT

Its a starry moonlit night The shadows crowd around the
panicked Z who looks up at the sky as we see the army on the
march

Z
Wait a minute theres been a
mistake Ive got to get back to the
colony

Z starts to fall out of line but Barbatus looking
concerned stops him

BARBATUS
Are you crazy kid They shoot
deserters

Z swallows hard

BARBATUS
You just stick by old Barbatus
Hell watch out for you
(off Zs look)
Whatsamatter kid Leave a girl
behind

Z
Yeah Well -- no Shes kind of
playing hard to get As a matter of
fact shes playing completely
unattainable

(nervously)
So whats on the schedule A brisk
walk a foraging expedition

BARBATUS
No -- were going to attack the
termites

Z
(alarmed)
Attack But -- I hate attacking
Its so hostile

Around Z and Barbatus the ants start up a marching song
which we intersperse with dialogue between Barbatus and Z to
form a montagetime-cut as the ant army marches on to the
termite capital

ANT SOLDIERS

(to the tune of When

Johnny Comes

Marching Home)
We ants go marching one by
one hurrah hurrah We slaughter
termites just for fun Hurrah
Hurrah

Z
So -- these termites theyre little
shy retiring insects

BARBATUS
(grim smile)
No such luck Those dirty terms are
five times bigger than us and they
shoot acid from their foreheads

SOLDIER ANTS
We ants go marching two by two
hurrah Hurrah Well all be dead
before were through hurrah Hurrah

Montage shots of an ant column marching diagonally across the
screen fading into another column marching diagonally
downwards across the screen

Z
Well what exactly does our platoon
do Serve beverages Process
paperwork
BARBATUS
Our platoon has the best assignment
of all Were the first into battle

ANT SOLDIERS
We ants are marching three by three
hurrah Hurrah Dead ants is what
we soon will be hurrah Hurrah

montage shot of Zs column crossing a bridge composed of
living ants -- all of whom look extremely uncomfortable as
theyre getting stepped on

So were going back for more armor
right I mean these guys are from
outer space how are we supposed to
beat them

BARBATUS
Superior numbers kid

EXT TERRAIN NEAR TERMITE STUMP - NIGHT

Z looks up to seelooming high above themthe TERMITE
CITY which is built in the stump of a dead tree From here
it looks like a demonic Mount Fuji The COLONEL ANT shouts
an order

COLONEL
ATTAAAAAAAAACK

The front line of ants starts rushing towards the termite
colonyZ is swept along

BARBATUS
Over the TOOOOOOOOOOO00O0-OP

Z is swept along and up the side of the stump as thousands of
ants invade the colony through every possible entrance
Upover the lip of the stumpand down inside to the very
middle of the termite colony

Into a disquietingly peaceful scene Theyre in the middle
of the hollowed-out trunk and ants keep pouring in -- but
theres not a termite to be seen Barbatus looks around
suspiciously

BARBATUS
Its too damn quiet

Then we hear a strange tapping noise Barbatus looks over
and sees that Zs teeth are chattering with fear

BARBATUS
Dont be scared kid Barbatuss
got yer back

Z
(petrified)
Maybe they went out for the evening
Lets leave them a message and head
home

COLONEL
(ignoring him)
Light it up

A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and
pinches him The firefly yelling Yipe Yipe Yipe
shoots into the air like a flare lighting up the interior of
the stump with eery shifting luminescence

Then we notice hollowed into the inside of the stump like
innumerable pockmarks termite holes staring out upon the
stumpand with an unearthly ROAR we see the first of
hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the
tree right onto the ant army

COLONEL
Theyre here

BARBATUS
(to Z)
Keep your head down

Within moments Z finds himself in the middle of a
BLOODBATH The ants have broken into the colony but are
taking heavy losses from the gigantic blind acid-spewing
termites The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as
something out of Braveheart In a few QUICK SHOTS from Zs
perspective we see

-- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier but are

literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid
from its forehead

-- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is
pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds

-- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one
and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws

Z
(looking around)
Guys Guys It isnt too late for
all of us to just talk this over

Just then a termite burst up from the ground and turns to
face Z Z is dwarfed by this hulking roaring drooling
monstrosity

Z
Wait Please Acid makes me come
out in spots -- Could I just say I

have always had the greatest respect
for your species I mean eating
wood -- why didnt I think of that
I --

The termite rears getting ready to melt Z when OOF hes
knocked backwards by

Z
BARBATUS You -- you saved my life

BARBATUS
Dont get all sappy about it

As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite the
Colonel strides up to Z puffing on a cigar

COLONEL
I love the smell of formic acid in
the morning

Z
Look out

A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel instantly
burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar Zs
paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites
rumbling towards them Z terrified dives into the hole
that the huge termite made

INT TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT

and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound
The corridors here are primitive caveman-like pocked with
jagged access holes

No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes
burrowing out from one of the side walls snapping at Zs
head 2Z just avoids getting decapitated and digs straight
through the wall in order to escape
INT TERMITE QUEENS CHAMBER - NIGHT

Straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the
Queens chamber This is nothing like the civilized court of
the ant colony -- its a huge stinking fetid dungeon whose

walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled
stones

The termite queen a repulsive slimy squirming foot-long
monster is attended by a crew of diminutive blind termite
nurses The queen turns to look Z right in the eye

Z
Excuse me I seem to be lost and I
was wondering if you could give me --

Before Z can say directions the queen gives out a
piercing blood-curdling shriek The nurses start shrieking
too

Z
(backing away)
Ill let myself out

But the queens shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the
biggest one weve seen yet -- who is charging headlong at 2Z
jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors

Z
(backing away)
Shoo -- Torro Torro
At the last moment Z jumps out of the way -- and the termite
runs headfirst into the supporting column of the chamber As
if on a spring release the termites jaws clamp shut -- and

shatter the base of the column The walls of the room begin
to rumble

The termite turns to eat Zbut is crushed by a stone
falling from the ceiling which gives a final shudder and
collapses raining earth and stones down on the queen

As the walls of the chamber crumble melees of ants and
termites pour into the room from the corridors around and
abovethey keep struggling until

ANT OFFICER
(points at Z)
Hes killed their Queen

Z
Hey Im sorry it was a mistake --
ANT OFFICER
VICTORY

We can see that the termite warriors deprived of their
leader are suddenly confused and directionless easy prey
for the ants

Z
(facetious)
This is terrific Lets exact
crippling war reparations Lets set
up a puppet government

ANT OFFICER
Lets slaughter them all

The ants set about killing the disoriented termites whenwe
hear another rumble coming from the outsidethe ants look
up confusedly

-And a (from the ants point of view) five-hundred foot
long tongue bursts through the top of the chamber with a
CRASH The ten or so ants standing directly below are
smashed by the tongue which squirts out a spray of saliva
around the crater As quick as it appeared the tongue
retracts with a hideous SLUUURPING sound We can now see
the end of the snout of an ant-eater poking through a hole in
the ceiling high above

ANT OFFICER
INCOMING

The tongue comes down again smashing some more ants whose
bodies are slurped up by the tonguethe ants scatter but
to no avail as the tongue comes smashing down again and
again

Z heads into a side corridor as the tongue smashes down
again barely missing him

Z retreats along the corridor as the tongue searches for him
across the tunnel from intersecting access-tunnels getting
closer and closer to Z dragging more and more screaming ants
and struggling termites

Then the tongue disappears Silence Z wipes his brow

And we hear a thunderous SNIFFING noise as the anteater
searches for more prey and the tongue starts rumbling down
the corridor right towards Z the tip squirming as it
ricochets along the walls
Z gets up and runs the tongue lapping towards him
reminiscent of the stone sphere that nearly crushed Indiana
Jones in Raiders of the Lost Ark The walls disintegrate
under the pressure of the tongue which gets closer to
Zcloser

and just misses him as Z tumbles out of the stump and down
to the groundZ sits there dazed as we see the huge form
of the anteater withdraw its tongue and with a final
contented burp shuffle off into the distance

EXT TERMITE STUMP - MORNING

Z makes his way across the corpse-strewn battlefield an
expression of horror on his face

BARBATUS (0S)
Z Over here

Z
(hopeful)
Barbatus

Z looks down at his feet where Barbatuss still-living
decapitated head is looking up at him

Z
(shocked)
Barbatus

BARBATUS
Be honest kid -- am I hurt bad

Z
No no yourelookin good
Youve got good color in your cheeks

BARBATUS
No -- I can see it in your eyes Im
a goner Its alright Z In this
ants army a soldiers life aint
worth a sack of fungus
(he winces)
I cant feel my legs

Z
Hang in there buddy You can make
it Just -- take deep breaths Ill
try and find your body -- its gotta

be around here somewhere
BARBATUS
(gasping)
I wonderwhatwas it allfor

Z
Barbatus hang on -- Barbatus

BARBATUS
Dont make my mistake kid
dontbe a gruntyour whole
life

Barbatus dies leaving Z heartbroken
CUT TO
INT EARLY MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

Weaver is passing as a worker working alongside much
smaller worker ants He actually loves the work Hes
throwing up dirt like a bulldozer Hes so enthusiastic he
scoops up a WHOLE ANT in his shovel and tosses him aside
Azteca whos standing next to him in line is shocked by
and a little attracted to this turbo-worker

AZTECA
Hey slow it down big boy Youre
making the rest of us look badHow
come I havent seen you around here
before

WEAVER
(covering)
Im newI was born yesterday

AZTECA
Tell me about it

WEAVER
Nobody told me digging was so much
fun You pick up the dirt you move
it you pick it up again you move it

again -- lots of repetitions you

pincers --
AZTECA
(ogling him)

Mmm yes I see what you mean

While Azteca is checking out the hunky new worker work has
effectively stoppedclods are piling up behind Weaver A
Foreman comes striding down the line furious

FOREMAN
Whats the holdup here

Weaver whips his shovel up to his shoulder and salutes as if
hes dealing with a superior officer

WEAVER
Sorry sir -- I was just having a
little chat with my friend --

FOREMAN
(yelling at Weaver)
Who said you could have a chat
Youre not a chatter youre a
digger So shut up and dig

AZTECA
Leave him alone Hes new

FOREMAN
You too Well just for that you
lose your days rations Now get
back to work

The Foreman heads down the line shoving and berating the
other workers as he goes along

AZTECA
(surprised at herself)
I dont know what came over me
talking back like that I must be
going crazy

WEAVER
Sorry I got you in trouble But
listen you can share my rations

AZTECA
(flirting)
Are you asking me out to dinner

WEAVER
(blushing)
No -- I mean yes -- I mean -- if you
dont have other plans

AZTECA
Ill make myself availableListen
better watch out with the
backtalk I dont know want you to
end up like the guy who used to work
next to me Im afraid he got
downsized

EXT ANT MOUND - DAY

Some guard ants are looking out across the sandy main
entrance to the hive

GUARD ANT
Look Theyre back The armys
back Alert the colony

The other ant starts ringing a bell rushing down into the
colony

CUT TO
INT TOWN CENTER - DAY

A huge crowd is forming eager to welcome the army back A
band is striking up a triumphant victory song confetti and
streamers are being thrown as General Formica strides in
followed by Carpenter

EXCITED ANTS
The armys returned Our brave boys
are back (etc)

Everyone waves little flags as the tuba player Oompah-oompah-
oompahs

and Z walks into the hall looking bedraggled and
exhausted his helmet hanging over his ears

The band slows to a halt

At the edge of the crowd Azteca sitting on Weavers
shoulders can just about see over the crowd

AZTECA
t looks like only one soldier made
it back

Weaver looks distraught

WEAVER
(to himself)
Poor Z -- I should never have let you

go

Far down the hall Z is describing the battle
Z
It was horriblea massacre a

massacre upon a massacre First we
massacred them then they massacred
us then it was halftime Ive never

seen such violence such
bloodthirstiness such bad
mannersIm the only one that made
it

The atmosphere is somber This is a tough one to try and put
a spin onbut that doesnt stop Formica from trying

FORMICA
ONE TO NOTHING WE WIN

The band strikes up again and everyone cheers

Z
No -- you -- you dont understand

FORMICA
Damn Im proud of you boy I wish
I had a hundred ants of your caliber
The world would tremble Now time
for some R and R Youre invited to
the royal victory party

Z
Royal victory party Willwill
Princess Bala be there

FORMICA
Of course The entire royal family
will be there to honor you

Z
(thinks)
ONE TO NOTHING

Renewed CHEERS as Z is lifted onto the shoulder of some of
the soldiers who stayed behind

AZTECA
Wait a minute thats no soldier --
thats 2

WEAVER

Z Our Z2 The little guy made it

Z is following Formica away from the cheering crowd
EXT ABOVE TOWN CENTER - DAY
Z and Formica are going up the royal Stairway together

FORMICA
Son youre an ant after my own
heart A warrior An ant that looks
death right in the face and laughs

Z
Well I generally just make
belittling comments and snicker
behind deaths back So tell me
fellow war-mongerdo you think
Princess Bala likes men in uniform

FORMICA
Well she better -- shes engaged to
one Me
Z
Engaged As in youre getting
married
FORMICA
Affirmative
Z
Soyou two are in love
FORMICA

In love

(shakes his head)
Im just a plain old soldier at
heart Ill tell you what I love --
the field -- blood -- death --
ordersand the company of other
warriors

Formica gives Z a manly slap on the back Z looks a little
uncomfortable as we

CUT TO
INT THRONE ROOM - DAY
Z follows Formica and Carpenter into the throne room At the
end of the hall a society band is playing The room is full

of courtier ants and officers

Waiters are gliding around holding trays of hors douevres
Z
Wow what a spread -- you know
theres a food shortage in the rest
of the colony

FORMICA
Yes and do you know why theres a
food shortage

Z
-Not enough food

FORMICA
Negatory Too many ants And while
we soldiers go out there and fight
and bleed and die for the colony
the namby-pamby workers live it up
back home

Feeling a little hot Z wipes his brow

Z
Well I I dont think living it up
is the right term -- how about

working themselves to death

FORMICA
I tell you son sometimes at night
I see myself in battle fighting a
horrible faceless enemy with the
future of our whole species at stake
And always the dream ends with each
of us plunging his sword into the
others heart

Z
(spooked)
Oh hey thats great I think I see
an old war buddy over there its
been fun chatting Good luck with
the hallucinations

Z escapes from Formica who gazes after him suspiciously

Z mingles in with the crowd then he sees Princess Bala
standing with a group of officers who are eating hors
doeuvres

OFFICER
(telling a joke)
What do you call it when 10000
workers are killed in a tunnel cave-
in

(a beat)
Who cares Theyre workers

The officers laugh but Bala looks bored in this stuffy
social scene

Z

Butdont you think the worker
class is the very foundation of the
colony --

(realizes hes

getting odd looks)
I mean uh without them who would
we stand on

More laughter

BALA
Youre the hero of the recent termite
campaign arent you

Z
Well if single-handedly vanquishing
the enemy and slaughtering a whole
nestful of termites makes someone a
hero yes I am

Z reaches for a tray of canapes that a waiter is carrying by
and KNOCKS the whole thing CLATTERING to the ground

Z
(feigning nonchalance)
And you are

BALA
Im Princess Bala

Z
Ah yes
(affected)
Well charmed Im sure So
Princess have you ever danced with

a hero
BALA
Yes
Z
(deflated)

Ohoh well then one more wont
matter

She moves towards the dance floor 2Z spit-combs his
antennae struts after her -- until he trips on his sword
He tumbles falls but hops to his feet just as Bala turns
toward him turning it into a ballet plies

Z
Just warming up

She frownstheres something familiar about this guy But
then they start dancing

ACROSS THE ROOM The Queen and General Formica watch the
party

QUEEN
All these parties are so marvellously
alike

FORMICA
They should be
(suspicious)
But theres something funny about
that soldier

Formica strides over to where Z and Bala are dancing

FORMICA
(glowering)
May I cut in

Z
(intimidated)
Oh of course --

BALA
(pulling Z back)
No General Im dancing with the
war hero

Z
(trying to placate
Formica)
Uh sorry General IIve always

had this animal magnetism it --

Bala YANKS Z back onto the dance floor dancing away from
Formica

BALA
You dance
Divinely

BALA
No weirdlyYou remind me of
someone

Formica catches Balas eye She frowns at him and decides
to get a little shocking

BALA
He was swarthyprimitive
earthysensual

As she says these things Z tries to act accordingly

BALA
He was a worker I danced with him
at a workers bar just the other day
Im not shocking you am I

Z
(proudly)
Noas a matter of fact

BALA
(shocked)
OH MY GOD ITS YOU YOURE A
WORKER A filthy stupid

disgusting WORKER
Everybody gasps The dancing stops cold

Z
Gee uh could you say it a little
louder I think there are some ants
in the next colony who didnt hear
you

BALA
I CANT DANCE WITH A WORKER

Z
(offended)
Thats not what you said the other
night --
BALA

(now shes panicked)
Quiet -- sshhh
Z
(digging it in)
-- At the worker bar You were
pretty hot to trot then

BALA
SSHH SSHH

A livid Formica is stalking over towards them

FORMICA
(furious)
Whats this A worker has been
masquerading as a war hero

Z
Well it wasnt a masquerade really
it was more what Id call a clever
ruse --

FORMICA
ARREST HIM

Z
Cant we all settle this like
adults -- were not larvae anymore --

Angry officers begin to surround Z who hides behind Bala in
fear using her as a shield

QUEEN
Oh my god Hes taking her hostage

Z
No Im not -- I mean -- nobody move
Or the Princess gets it

People shout and scream as Z backs up with the
Princessinto the kitchen

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Z backs up into the kitchen still pulling Bala along with
him Here ant chefs are preparing food for the party
vomiting little florets onto a platter Formica and the
soldiers follow them in

Z
(to Formica)
Stay back you lunatic Do you think
I dont know how to use this
Z realizes that hes pointing his finger at them

Z
Uh-oh

The officers rush forand Z with Bala in tow falls
backwards into an opening marked GARBAGE

EXT ANT MOUND - DAY

HOLD ON the GARBAGE CHUTE EXIT Nothing happens for a
moment Then --

From a distance we hear the faint sound of SCREAMING
dopplering closer --

-- and then Z and Bala come flying out of the exit right
into the mud cutting off the scream abruptly

Bala sits up coated in mud Z is nowhere to be seen
Because shes on top of him

PRINCESS
This is thoroughly unacceptable

Z
Youre telling me

She gets up and runs back towards the colony entrance where
soldiers are already issuing to get her

BALA
Im coming Im coming

Butjust as Balaa about to be rescuedwhat looks like a
gigantic LASER BEAM sweeps along the rim of the colony
sizzling the ground as it moves alongand IGNITES the lead
soldier into FLAMES Bala looks stunned

Z watches in horror as another soldier ant is FRIED and we
look up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNIFYING GLASS casting the
beamwe can just about make out the huge grotesque figure
(a seven year old kid) holding it

Bala who has no idea whats really going on turns from the
colony and runs the other way

BALA
Im going Im going

unfortunately this draws the fire of the laser which
follows after her in what looks like a strafing run SIZZLING
in her footsteps

Z whos running towards the princess suddenly realizes that
hes running towards certain doomand joins Bala in legging
it away from the colony under a brown leaf which bursts
into flamesbetween the redwood-like stalks of some
flowersand finally into the relative safety of some
grasswhere they throw themselves on the ground exhausted

Cut TO

EXT WEED CLUMP - DAY

Z and Bala dust themselves off

BALA
What was that thing

Z
How should I know

BALA
I order you to find out where we are

Z
Alright alright Ill try to get
directions from one of the locals

Z tries to flag down some passing bees

Z
Excuse me I --
(it passes him by
he tries the next)
Pardon me --
(same response)
And they call them social insects

BALA
Climb up that tree and get a better
view

Bala points to a thin blade of grass Gingerly Z tests the
grass and starts climbing up itbut his weight bends it so
that hes lowered back to the ground face to upside-down
face with Bala

BALA
Ive been kidnapped by the village
idiot
Z squares

She looks

Whos the bigger idiot -- the idiot
who gets kidnapped or the idiot who
lets herself get kidnapped by the
idiot

BALA
How dare you speak to me like that
Im the Princess

up with her

Z
Theoretically yes But is the
monarchical hierarchy applicable
without the underlying social
structure to support it

BALA
Of course It defines society To
deny the precept is to say that order
is an arbitrary distinction applied
by the society itself

Z
But can there be a society composed
of just two ants

BALA
No Theres no such thing as just
two ants You never see just two
ants -- you see a million ants

Z

Look around sweetheart

around She doesnt like what she sees

glowers at Z

BALA
I -- hate -- you

Z
Well I guess that makes us even

BALA
Ha Dont make me laugh Youre
crazy about me Thats why you lied
and cheated to get near me

Z
Oh come on youre the one who came
after me -- the swarthy earthy

She
sensual worker

BALA
(repulsed)
I was slumming it I danced with you
because you were the most pathetic
specimen in the place

Z
Is that the same standard you used to
choose General Formica

BALA
I didnt choose him What kind of
idiot would
(unconvincingly)
choose who she wanted to marry

She shakes herself out of it

BALA
Now worker you shall take me back
to the colony and have your head cut
off and stuck on a sharp pole

Z
Well thats an appealing offer
butconsidering the options
(he decides)
You go back Me Im going to
Insectopia

BALA
Insectopia You stupid worker
thats just a fairy tale

Z

Yeah well I have it on a reliable
source

(he knows that was

maybe stretching it)
that it exists Now you follow
the yellow egg

(looking around)
That direction

BALA
Worker Come back here now

Z
Ive got a name Its Z
BALA
Thats not a name Thats just a
letter

Z meanwhile hits the road Bala has no idea of where to
go Just then the scariness of the outside world comes
through to her

We start hearing NOISES -- the equivalent of scary jungle
sounds in a Tarzan movie -- the HISSING CROAKING
CHIRRUPING Bala sees eyes looking out at her from all
directionsand spots a colossal monster (a sparrow) fixing
her with his beady gaze

BALA

(clears her throat)
Worker

(no responselouder

now)
Oh WORKER Where are you

(getting desperate)
Z 2 Wait for me

Bala heads off after Z
INT MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

The mass of worker ants are swinging pick-axes in the tunnel
The foreman moves up the line BERATING the workers yelling
at them to dig faster

AZTECA
I tell ya Im gettin sick of bein
yelled at

WORKER 1
What do you want were just workers

WEAVER
You know youre not just workers --
you can be whatever you want to be
Look at Z He started as a worker --
then he became a soldier

AZTECA
Thats right He slaughtered
hundreds of termites single-handedly

WORKER 2
I heard about this guy
(turning to the other
workers)
He crashed a party at the palace
Then he took a hike with one of the
royal babes And when they tried to
stop him he just looked at a
couplea guards and they burst into
flames

WORKER ANT 1
Youre nuts how could a worker do
all that

WEAVER
Well because hes more than a
workerhes awhat did he call
it Azteca

AZTECA
Invisible
WEAVER
No -- an individual
WORKER 2

Whats that

WEAVER
Well itssomeone with his own
point of viewsomeone who does what
he wants not whatever hes told to
do

AZTECA
(eyes lit up
watching Weaver)
Someone who follows his heart

WEAVER
(taking Aztecas hand)
Rightbecause every ants important

WORKER 2
(scoffs)
But that would mean Im important

WORKER 1
Im outta here this sounds like
trouble to me

But more ants are gathering round

WEAVER
We can all be individuals Just like
Zz

Weaver and Azteca hold hands More ants are gathering
around dropping their tools

EXT BIKE PATH - DAY

LONG SHOT A glimmering desert landscape (think of The
Suns Anvil in Lawrence of Arabia) Two small figures can
be seen tiny dots moving across the arid whiteness

Theyre Bala and Z who are crossing a concrete path in the
park which they perceive to be a desert

BALA
Waterwater

Z
Waterwater -- oh you already said
that

BALA

(walking along)
My skins dry my exoskeleton is
crackingI wish Id never met you
you ruined my life

Z
I ruined your life Look I was
perfectly happy until I met you --
alright I was miserable but I was
happily miserable

Over Zs line we can see a GIGANTIC WHEEL getting larger
and larger and heading right towards them a GIGANTIC WHEEL
(the front wheel of a bicycle which is heading right towards
them)

BALA
Look out

Bala pushes Z out of the way just as the wheel rolls past
with a cacophonous CRUNCHING GRINDING noise -- like a
gigantic millwheel

BALA
Were going to die

Z
Come on -- its gone What are the
chances of that happening again
No sooner has he said it than the rear wheel of the bike
thunders past

Z
Well Ill be

Bala notices that theyre clutching one another in fear she
pushes him away

BALA
Why didnt I listen to my mother
-whyd I have to go looking for
trouble Any ant would have given
their left legs to be in my
positionwhats wrong with me

Z
Want a list

BALA
(urgent)
Wait I hear something

We can in fact hear a low musical PLUNK theres a pause
and then we can hear it again

Z and Bala walk over a rocky dune (the soft shoulder of the
path) Beyond the grass starts up again They have come to
the end of the desert (ie the other side of the path)
Through the blades of grass we can see

Z
Itsits

BALA
WATER

EXT LAKE - DAY

A LAKE (a puddle) stretches before them It is in fact the
overflow of a drinking-fountain whose drain is jammedas Z
and Bala run to the lake water dribbles from the fountain
and into one edge of the pool (to the ants its a waterfall)

Bala and Z run to the edge of the water and start slurping
They smile at each other until they remember that they dont
like each other

Z
This lake is huge And so close to
the colony Think of the vacation
potential

BALA
Cut me down a soft leaf so I can take
a nap

Z

Listen Princess you cant order
me around Out here youre not the
boss anymore -- out here youre
just --

-- But before he can finish a water droplet from the
fountain falls on him It may not sound like much but to Z
its as though a ten-foot diameter sphere of jello had
engulfed him

Zs stuck inside because of the surface tension of the
droplet which doesnt burst just quivers up and down
Inside Z is slowly frantically drowning and screaming for
help But his screams are muffled in the water

BALA
(annoyed)
Out here Im just what

Z
(through the water)
H1l11l11lllp

BALA
(hands on hips)
Stop fooling around in there

By now the droplet has started rolling and Z is being turned
upside-down He manages to get one foreleg out of the
droplet and in a frantic attempt to pull himself out pulls
Bala in by the leg

BALA
Let me go

But its too late -- theyre now both stuck in the droplet
and as Z continues to drown he also has to deal with Bala
yelling at him -- though we cant hear exactly what it is

shes yelling through the water

Then having run out of air she too starts thrashing
alternately trying to swim and trying to slap him as Z tries
to defend himself Finally all this commotion is enough to
make the droplet burst spilling the two coughing
sputtering drenched ants onto the ground

They both lie there miserable wet and cold

BALA
(chants to herself)
Im going to be rescued soon Im
going to be rescued soon Im going
to be rescued soon

Z watches her incredulously

Z
Princess has it ever occurred to you
that theyre not going to rescue you

BALA
General Formica wont let me die out
here Im his fiancee

Z
Look How many other Princesses are
there

BALA
Five thousand three hundred and
ninety -- no About five thousand
four hundred by now

Z
And only you can become a Queen

BALA
Wellno but --

Z
So what makes you so special

BALA
(hesitates)
WellI am the oldest

Bala turns from Z Shes thinking things over realization
dawning on her

BALA
By three seconds

She looks out into the grass forest

BALA
(to herself)
Youre right There are as many
Princessesas there are blades of
grass

Z overhearing her slowly puts his hand on her shoulder
INT MEGA-TUNNEL - DAY

Formica and Carpenter are walking into the entrance of the
tunnel with a squad of soldiers

FORMICA
Dammit this tunnel is priority A-1
We cant afford any delays on this
project

CARPENTER
Ive never seen anything like it

Ahead of them a group of a few hundred workers have stopped
work and are sitting down chanting

Formica nods at Carpenter who smiles and opens a door Two
soldiers walk in holding Azteca The color drains from
Weavers face

FORMICA

satisfaction)

AZTECA

Weaver starts to get up but the guards behind him hold him
down

WEAVER

Formicas face lights up

FORMICA

The guards exit with Weaver and Azteca

FORMICA

EXT GRASS JUNGLE - DAY
Z and Bala are lost wandering through the grass

BALA
(looking hopeless)
I swear weve passed this blade of
grass three times

Z keeps marching on

BALA
Face it Z were lost We must have
walked halfway across the world by
now How did I get into this mess

Z
(too shy to look at
her)
Come ontell me there wasnt just
a littlesomething between us that
first night at the bar The night we
danced

BALA
(sadly)
What difference does it makewere
both going to starve to death or get
squished or set on fire

But Z is just gawking The shot expands to show that they
have stumbled onto

Z
The land of red and white

EXT FALSE INSECTOPIA - DAY

A PICNICGROUNDSA red and white picnic blanket which to
the ants looks like a vast undulating pavilion stretches
before them They gaze up at two obelisks a salt and pepper
shaker

Behind that is a gigantic tupperware jar full of potato
salad and sandwiches stacked high It all looks perfect
with the clean lines and monumental proportions of fascist
architecture In fact it looks a little too perfect

Z
Weve found it Insectopia Look at
all this food

BALA
(amazed)
You were rightyou were right
(smiling happily)
Z its beautiful

Z
Lets dig in

Z goes over to a gigantic sandwich but -- BOOIIING -- hes
prevented from getting at it by the saran wrap covering it

Z
Theres - theres some kind of force
field

Bala joins him laboring against the saran wrap Then both
of them hear laughter from above

MALE WASP (0S)
(lockjawed accent)
Muffy look party-crashers

FEMALE WASP (0S)
(laughing)
Theyre simply too much Chip

Bala and Z look up to see two large yellow WASPS hovering in
the air above them The husband and wife wasps have
lockjawed William F Buckleyesque accents

MALE WASP
(to Z and Bala)
You down there havent you ever been
to a picnic

Z
Hunh

FEMALE WASP
Habla Ingles
(to Male Wasp)
Well I really dont know who they are

Z
Were ants

The Male Wasp zooms in closer

MALE WASP
Poopsie we know some ants dont we
(to Z)
Are you related to the Fifth Avenue

ants

FEMALE WASP
Darling do you have to talk to any
insect from off the street

MALE WASP
Just being friendly Poopsie

BALA
Hello Im not just any insect
My mother is the Queen
(momentously)
Im Princess Bala

MALE WASP
(under his breath)
Theyre Eurotrash dear

We hear a loud RUMBLING noise -- the family is about to sit
down for their picnic lunch Gigantic hands reach down and
pull away the force fields

MALE WASP
Lunch
(to Z)
A little piece of advice sport --
bob and weave Bob and weave

BALA
What do you mean

MALE WASP
Well -- like my father used to say --
theres no such thing as a free meal

The wasps dive in to the picnic darting in for a bite and
then dashing away again
THE WASPS
Excuse me -- Ill have some potato
salad -- thank-you -- dont mind if
I do After you (etc)

-- But all is not well We pull back to reveal that Z and
Bala are standing in front of a giant sneaker logo which is
attached to a giant sneaker Which moves

Z
I sort of imagined Insectopia a
little differently --

Just at that moment we hear a whistling in the air -- and
the female wasp is crushed by a huge swatter that sweeps out
of the sky sending the picnic blanket billowing up in an
aftershock that throws Bala and Z to the ground

BALA
OhmyGod

MALE WASP
(shaking her)
Muffy Muffy Wake up

But she doesnt move The Male Wasp stares up at the sky
MALE WASP

(heartbroken)
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYY

But Z also looking up has no time to commiserate

Z
Bala look out

They are only saved by the fact that they are so small - the
holes of the swatter pass over them

The woman realizing that the swatter wont work on ants
throws it to the side and tries stomping on them

Before Bala can get away a sneaker falls on her with a
thunderous BOOM that shakes the ground

BALA
MMMfflimmm

The shoe rises as the person wearing it steps awayand we
see that Bala is stuck in one of the ridges of the waffle-
soled sneaker adhering to a big piece of bubblegum
BALA
Z Help me

But Bala is carried off on the sneaker in a huge looping
ferris-wheel-like motion BOOM The sneaker on which Bala
is stuck falls again as the woman tries to step on Z too --

Z
Bala
(mournfully)
Ill never see her again

-- But he does instantly as the shoe rises again showing
Bala stuck deeper in the bubblegum --

BALA
Z Get me out of heeeeere

-- The woman has decided to walk away from the picnic to get
the bubblegum off her shoeZ heart sinks as the shoe Balas
stuck on lopes off into the distance

Z
(thinks)
These things always come in twos

He sees a SECOND SHOE starting to rise --

Z
Take me to your leader

Z runs towards the shoe as it rises and at the last moment
catches on to the snaky swinging shoe-lace

Z
Whoooooocoaaaa

The sneaker lifts off into the air with Z holding on for
dear life to the lace and getting further and further away
from Bala as hes drawn to a vertiginous heightthe
landscape can be seen rolling and pitching crazily in the
background

Z
Bala Come back here

For a moment the sneaker seems to pause in the airthen it
descends again in a stomach-churning roller-coaster free-
fall as the sneaker on which Bala is stuck rises up again

BALA
Zrii) Im stuck
-- But Z is trying to keep his lunch down as he descends
The sneaker hits the ground and Z can feel himself
againits now or never

Z
(Tarzan whoop)

As the sneaker rises again he swings off the lace hurtling
through the air and catching one of the laces of Balas
sneakerthe momentum swings him up and under the sole

BALA
Z Youre here

Z gets smashed into the bubblegum next to Bala Now hes
stuck too

Z
(ruefully)
Yeah Im here

The sneaker descends again Z and Bala hold hands and SCREAM
as they see the ground rise too meet them

THUD Theyre squished deeper into the bubblegum The
sneaker rises again

BALA
(emotional)
Zif we dont make itI just want
you to know

Z
(touched)
Yes

BALA
This is all your fault

The sneaker rises and seems ready to fall againbut
instead it just hovers there (The person wearing it is
balancing on one leg and about to scrape off the bubblegum
with a penny)

Z
Were safe

Just then the hand holding the penny looms upthe penny
is by ant standards about sixty feet high The huge image
of Abraham Lincoln stares down at them
Z
Who the hell is that

The penny starts scrapes the bubblegum off the sneaker
bringing Bala and Z along with it Theyre carried through
the air as the penny gets thrown awayturning over and over
in a lopsided orbit as Bala and Z SCREAM

and land with a CRASH in total darkness

EXT LAKE - DAY

The lake where Z and Bala were nearly drowned by the water
droplet

The earth shakes as a HUGE MONSTROUS creature approaches the

lake - and begins to drink from it The creature seems to
hear something and growling turns its ugly head Its a
Pomeranian one of those yappy little lap-dogs -- but seen

from ant perspective its something out of a horror movie

TOUGH VOICE (0S)
Ant Team Six -- take him out

The monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching
intruders -- a bunch of flying ants who look as though
theyre attacking the Death Star

The monster rears and snaps at two of the ants who are
making a diversionary run

and then gets it from the rest of the ants who land on his
soft wet nose and start stinging away like crazy

The monster rears back in pain -- and runs away YIPPING

The members of ANT TEAM SIX a crack team of hardcore flying-
ant commandoes a la Seal Team Six break off the attack and
land

MAJOR MANDIBLE
And dont come back you sissy

MAJOR MANDIBLE Ant Team Sixs lethal commander steps into
frame Hes the one-eyed killer we met in the bar earlier

The rest of his team fan out to search the area

MANDIBLE
Talk to me

COMMANDO ANT
Zand the Princess were here sir
Signs of a struggle

MANDIBLE
Lets get a read on that feremone
track

COMMANDO ANT 1
(to the others)
Get the sniffer

Two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a
piece of machinery on a tripod -- only its an ant -- a
highly specialized blind ant with an incredibly acute sense
of smell

TRACKER ANT
Balafind Bala

The tracker drool running out of its long proboscis sniffs
the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter

TRACKER ANT
(as hes swivelled)
Nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono

Finally the tracker stops swivelling pointing in one
direction and saying Yeahyeahyeahyeah

COMMANDO ANT 3

wisecracking royalty-grabbing rebel

SCUM

distance)

DEAD ANT MISTER

Mandibles muscles bulge The veins in his head throb This
is one ass-kicking ant Even Mandibles troops look scared
of him

MANDIBLE
Lets MOVE GO people GO Go

Ant Team Six takes to the air heading in the direction
indicated by the tracker ant
INT TRASH BAG - DAY
Darkness Out of it we hear the voices of Z and Bala

BALA
Come on Z

Z
Forget it You go ahead I give up
II dont know what I was thinking
Insectopia

In one corner of the screen we can see an irregular little
hole through which a shaft of light is falling Bala
proceeds towards it the hole appears to get bigger and
bigger

Z
(defeated)
Theres only one thing worse than an
ant who goes around mindlessly
following orders and thats an ant
whos too dumb to go around
mindlessly following orders

Bala stopsshe notices that theyre being watched Shes
emerging from a tied off garbage bag -- the yellow ties loop
away gracefully Bala and Z have been tossed into a garbage
area And above them and below them peering from garbage
cans recycling containers bags etc a multi-cultural
assortment of insects are regarding them

A laid-back FLY voices their thoughts

FLY
Whats with the bummer attitude

A nearby BUTTERFLY joins in

BUTTERFLY
Yeah -- nobody stresses out in
Insectopia

BALA

Did you say
Z
(joining Bala)

Insectopia

Z and Bala look around Just to get things straight the
garbage dump doesnt look disgusting -- that would be seeing

it through human eyes Instead were looking at it through

ant eyes -- and reimagined this way its Paradise Not the
ordered sterile paradise of the picnic but an earthly land
of plenty

The sides of the plastic garbage bags are sheer reflective
walls of smoothest obsidianthe garbage cans are gigantic
thick metal columns put there by the gods (think the
pyramids) a coke bottle refracting the sunlight into a
gorgeous rainbow trickles a fountain of sweet nectar into
the pink bittersweet flesh of a grapefruit half which
appears as a multi-chambered concave dome Everywhere
insects are disporting themselves -- a multi- species love-in
thats like an insect version of Woodstock

Bala and Z are awe-struck Bala turns to Z

BALA
(happily)
Z we made it

FLY
(alighting on the
grapefruit)
Cmon in The nectars fine

Like a kid at an amusement park Z slides down the smooth
side of the garbage bag whooshing this way and that until he
slides into one end of a straw (a red and white striped
tunnel) and is shot out

Z
Yippeeeeece

into a bottle-cap filled with lemonade which he
alternately drinks and swims through

Down at the bottlecap Z is drying himself off Then he
sees emerging from behind a lemon peel a gigantic TERMITE

Z
(terrified)
AAAAAGH

Surprisingly the termite seems equally terrified

FLY
(to Z)
Hey take it easy Theres nothin
to be afraid of
Z
Yeah well I make it a practice not
to trust anyone who shoots acid out
of their forehead

CRICKET
Dude here in Insectopia we dont
judge people by how many arms and
legs weve got

FLY
Yeah back home they called me a
fruitfly But here Im known
as
(with attitude)
Superfly

CRICKET
Anyway big Gus is mellow

The termite sticks his hand out A drop of acid drips from
his head and splashes at Zs feet

Z
(taking his hand
disgusted)
Charmed

Z reaches out and shakes the termites hand as Bala watches
smiling

CUT TO
EXT INSECTOPIA - NIGHT
The insects are having a cookout their faces illuminated by

the still-red ember of a match Platters heaped with food
lie untouched as they pat their bellies

Z and Bala sit next to one another smiling shyly as if they
had just met for the first time

Z
Soyou never did tell mewhat
made you come out to the worker bar
that night

BALA
Just looking for fun adventure
trouble I guess

Z
Well trouble is my middle name
Actually my middle name is 985
but I dont tell people Hey Bala
II actually have something of
yoursyou left it at the bar that
night

Z takes out Balas scarf which hes been keeping folded in
a pocket

Z
Sorry its been through a war not
to mention everything else

BALA
You held onto this all that time

Z

Well II know its a little
strange butI thought it might
come in handy if Ineeded a scarf
someday

(embarrassed)
Well to be honest I just liked
having it

He hands it back to her Bala looks at Z frankly openly
For a moment Z is shy Then he looks at her too Theyre
two lovers leaning closer about to have their first kiss
when --

BEETLE
Hey 2

The moment is wrecked Z looks up A chubby beetle stands
there with Gus the termite

BEETLE
Wanna bring back dessert Theres a
thirty foot long blimp in the next
can made completely of chocolate

Z
(annoyed)
Sure I wasnt busy or anything

Z gets up to go with them

Z
Great timing guys Ever wonder why
they call you pests
EXT INSECTOPIA TOP OF CAN - NIGHT

As Ant Team Six lands and takes up position above the feast
The tracker ant is going nuts

TRACKER ANT
Yesyesyesyesyes --

One of the commandoes puts his hand over the trackers mouth
to shut him up Mandible communicates with his troops by
pulling down his one functional antenna and gruffly
whispering into it as though it were one of those commando
headsets His troops do likewise

MANDIBLE
Talk to me

COMMANDO 1
Ive got a read on the Princess --
but target Z isnt accounted for

MANDIBLE
Lets move in

EXT INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

Back at the feast a cricket strums on his legs like a
guitar opining about life and the universe to a bunch of
other chilled-out hippyesque insectsBala taps her feet t
the song

CRICKET
What if likewere just these tiny
little things and were just like
part of this whole other huge
universe thats like so big we
dont even know it exists

LADYBUG
Manthats so deep

At that moment Ant Team Six rapels down from the top of the
garbage bin landing amongst the insects

MANDIBLE
EVERYBODY DOWN

The cricket gets up to confront Mandible but Mandible cold
cocks him with a right to the jaw The other insects too
surprised to fight just do as theyre told

MANDIBLE
Alright you hippy scum Make one
move and Ill exterminate you

A couple of commandoes grab Bala by the arms and heave her up

BALA
Stop You dont understand

MANDIBLE
I dont have to understand Missy --

INT INSECTOPIA - NIGHT

Z the termite the beetle and the fly are happily carrying
a huge MandM back to the feast

FLY
Man your girl is fly know what Im
saying

Z

(overdoing it)
Oh Bala I guess shes okay you
know for a princess I mean I
usually date queens or you know
empresses because sometimes the
lesser nobility are too much in awe
of my smouldering sensuality Please
stop me if Im making you feel
inadequate

They throw down the MandM which lands with a THUD Z notices
that the rest of the insects look spooked

Z
Whats the matter This place is as

cheery as a Roach Motel at check-out
time

Z looks around

LADYBUG
Balas been kidnapped Some flying
ants took her back to the colony

Z

Shes been kidnapped But I cant
live without her
Z just stands there heartbroken

Z
(determined)
Im going back Ive got to get her
Wholl come with me

Z looks around Nobodys volunteering Nothing but sheepish
looks and shuffling from the insects of Insectopia

Z looks disheartened Hes about to leave when --

MALE WASP (0S)
Ill go

The male wasp is hovering nearby

Z
(surprised)
You

MALE WASP
I know what its like to lose
someoneI keep hearing the sound of
Muffys flapping wingsso Ill take
you

Z hops on the wasps back

Z
Lets go pal

The wasp takes off leaving the other insects looking a
little chastized

FLY
Geez I feel like a real stinkbug

CUT TO
EXT SKY ABOVE COLONY - MORNING
The wasp and Z fly high above the colony

Z
WowI never saw things this way

From here we can see the whole layout of the land around the
colonythe desert (an asphalt path) and across it the
lake (the overflowing water fountain)

Z
Things look so close together from up
heretheres the desertand the
lake

(thinking about

something)
its not far from the colony at all

Suddenly the wasp bounces up and down in the air

MALE WASP
Sorry Turbulence

INT FORMICAS CHAMBERS - DAY

Formica sits at his desk going over some plans Formicas
chambers are located inside a snake skull with the eye
sockets serving as windows and the mouth serving as a door
The walls are hung with trophies -- the heads of other
insects

Ant Team Six burst in the doors of Formicas office carrying
the struggling and kicking Bala One of the commandoes sets
the tracker ant one the floorthen Formica gets up from his
desk as the commandoes bring the princess to him

FORMICA
Princess Bala Good
(with urgency)
Wheres Z

Bala replies warily

BALA
Heshes dead
(covering for 2)
You dont have to look for him
anymore He was eaten by a praying
mantis

FORMICA
(regretfully)
Its a shame he died prematurelyI
was hoping to kill him myself

BALA
Well youll never be able to hurt him
where he is now
(sadly)
I miss him already

FORMICA
(surprised)
You miss him Why

BALA
(angry)
Becausebecause hes twice the ant
that you are I could never go

through with marrying you Im --
Im an individual and when I get
married itll be to someone I choose

The soldiers look shocked For a moment Formica looks
furious Then he just shrugs

FORMICA

(shaking his head)
Princess Bala Im just a simple old
soldier and the ways of the feminine
mind are a little too complex for me
But one thing I do know is there are
more Princesses where you came from
I just hope theyre not all like you
In the meantime maybe we can arrange
for you to see Z again after all

He gestures to the commandoes who drag her out the door We
notice that the tracker ant has been left behind

EXT ANT MOUND - DAY

Z hops down from the wasp who has landed near the entrance
to the colony

MALE WASP
Good luck Z For a wingless insect
youre alright by me

Z
Thanks Chip

They shake hands and the wasp flies off

Z
(to himself)
How am I going to get in The place
is crawling with soldiers

Z starts for the nearest entrance -- but hes spotted by a
couple of SOLDIER ANTS

SOLDIER ANT
You there Worker
Zs caught -- its over He turns around with his hands up

Z
Dont bite I surrender

SOLDIER ANT
What are you doing out here All
workers are to remain inside the
colony by orders of General Formica

Z cant believe his luck -- and his curiosity is piqued

Z
(heading inside)
Wellif you insist

INT MEGATUNNEL - DAY

The Queen with Formica striding at her side is carried by
a personal escort of fifty or so struggling workers to the
bottom end of the Mega Tunnel where a red ribbon waits to be
cut

QUEEN
Very impressive General

Behind her hundreds of thousands of workers are crowded
looking confused and expectant Some of them clutch little
flags and noisemakers

MANDIBLE
Wave that flag you maggot

which we see are being handed out to them by Ant Team Six

FORMICA
Is there anything wrong your majesty

The Queen is looking around unhappily
QUEEN
Its justHow I miss Bala I wish
she were here for this special moment
Formica warmly places his hand on the Queens shoulder
FORMICA
(falsely supportive)

She is your majesty She is

where it begins to curve upwards towards the surface She
struggles against her bonds but cant get loose

INT ANT MOUND - DAY

Elsewhere in the colony a column of soldiers marches by and
we hear the TROMP-TROMP-TROMP of their boots When theyve
gone Z pokes his head out from behind a pile of dirthe
heads in the opposite direction of the soldiers

INT OUTSIDE FORMICAS CHAMBERS - DAY

Z creeps around the outside of Formicas chambers This part
of the colony seems to be deserted

Z
Geez this place really empties out

Z walks up to the skull that houses Formicas chambers and
peeks in the eye socket

INT FORMICAS CHAMBERS

Inside the Tracker Ant whos been left behind switches

For a moment Zs afraid Then he sees the small Tracker Ant
doesnt seem hostile

Z

The tracker ant keeps sniffing Z waves his hand in front of
the blind ants eyes

starts digging through the wall

INT SKYLIGHT APEX - DAY

Meanwhile A member of Ant Team Six -- the stupidest member
in fact waits at the very top of the tunnel where it
narrows almost to a point Hes hanging from a winch and
has a little hammer and chisel in his hand Hes WHISTLING
awaiting instructions

From here Z can see far down the tunnel to where the crowd
is gathering

BALA
Theyre having a ceremony to open the
Megatunnel

We can hear the sound of WATER SHIFTING somewhere above He
looks up the tunnelin the distance we can make out the
silhouete of the commando set to break open the wall

Z

Bala that -- that lake we found --
I think the tunnels right underneath
it

(horrified)
-- Formicas going to flood the
colony Thats what he meant when
said there were too many ants

BALA
Oh no

Bala looks too shocked to move Z starts pushing her into
the tunnel he made and starts heading down towards the crowd

BALA
Z what are you doing

Z
I know its crazy but -- I cant
just leave Dont argue with me If
Ive learned anything its that the
problems of two people dont add up
to a hill of ants in this world Or
beans Something like that Anyway
Ive got to warn the others

Z looks into Balas eyes

towards the crowd

INT ANT MOUND - DAY

All the SOLDIERS are filtering out of the assembly area
leaving the workers behind As his troops march by Formica
steps to the side and hands the Queen a pair of scissors to
cut the ribbon strung across the Megatunnel

FORMICA

furiously at the walland nothing but dust falls down The
commando looks at the dust as it falls down down the long
tunnelhe looks up at the dry wallHmmm

Then
THE WALL BURSTS OPEN

And a TORRENT starts pouring out -- swallowing the terrified

The Queen turns and for a brief moment is silhouetted
against the white-capped torrent of water

and then she picks her abdomen up like a skirt and high
tails it away from the torrent running so fast that she
passes some of her bearers on the way

And then the torrent spits out of the mouth of the
Megatunnel quickly filling up the chamber and branching into
all of its side tunnels as we see

A group of workers RUNNING up a side tunnel and getting
consumed by a wave which crashes down on them like a hand
slapping a table

Another group the members of which are getting swallowed up
one by one one of the ants runs up on the ceiling of the
tunnel and keeps on going upside-downit works for a while
but eventually he too is swallowed up
-- In the Nursery nurses are evacuating stacks of crying ant
babies

In one of the larger access-tunnels down which thousands of
workers are fleeing a group of ants turns and decides to
make a stand for it -- they link up in a mass and form a
LIVING DAM It holds for a while but then BURSTS scattering
and smashing ants along the sides of the tunnel before eating
them up

And we
CUT TO
INT TOWN CENTER - DAY

The huge main chamber of the colony where most of the
workers -- as well as Z Bala Weaver Azteca and the
Queen -- have run to

The chamber is rapidly flooding from all sides Water flows
out of every escape tunnel the workers tryand the crowd is
becoming more and more closely packed together as the waters
rise around them

AZTECA
Theres no way out

QUEEN
Were all going to drown

BALA
Zwhat can we do

Z clenches his fisthe feels utterly powerlessthen he
shouts

Dig
The workers turn to look at him questioningly

Z
Weve got to dig a trench around us

-- But one of the workers raises his hands

WORKER 1
Uhwe dont dig any more Were
individuals

WORKER 2
Yeah Were too important to dig
You taught us that Z You hate
digging

Z
(at his wits end)
Yeah but I hate drowning more Now
dig

WEAVER
You heard the ant -- DIG

The workers start to dig a circular moat around themselves
passing the dirt back into the middle of what remains of the
dry ground

-- But they seems to be making little headway against the
water as it continues to rush in

The ant labor we saw up to now were nothing compared to
this As the moat gets deeper the pile grows higher and
higherWeaver is digging up huge chunks of earthnearby
Azteca is digging like crazy tooZ runs around directing
traffic and encouraging the workers

Z
Thats it Pass the dirt back to the
center Go on

Nearby the Queen stands there looking squeamish

Z
Your highnesstime to get your
hands dirty

Gingerly the Queen reaches out for a clod of dirtand
passes it along Next thing you know shes practically
crushed by a huge load thrown up by Weaver

The water keeps rushing inbut now we notice that
the pile of dirt in the middle of the island created by
the digging of the moat is growing higher and higher

reaching up towards the ceiling of the chamber

And the water is getting swallowed up by the moat
swirling around angrily

Now Z looks up and sees that with a little more effort they
can reach the top --

Z
We need to form a scaffolding around
this mound -- lets DO IT

The workers start to cluster around the mound covering it
forming a tight network of living bodies around the mound up
towards the ceiling

Z
Now climb

The ants start to scale the scaffolding up towards the top
of the chamberits a swarming mass of ants hauling each
other up giving each other legs up climbing ever and ever
higher towards the top

Where they start to dig through the very ceiling

aS at the bottom of the mound Z starts to organize the
hauling away of the Queen as though she were a big cargo
container

Z
Okay boys -- take her up

Z slaps the Queen on the butt and shes winched away ona
cable composed entirely of ants linked arm in arm like those
plastic toy monkeys

EXT ANT MOUND - DAY

And Aztecas head pokes through the groundshe hauls
herself up and hundreds of ants pour up from the ground
widening the hole

INT TOWN CENTER - DAY

The water is risingbut almost all of the ants have
escapedZ clambers up the mound as the scaffolding of ants
rolls up from the bottom

And the rushing water finally wears down the earthen core of
the structure As Z hauls himself through the hole in the

ceiling

The entire structure collapses into the angry waters below
which seem furious to have missed their prey

EXT ANT MOUND - DAY

WORKER
He did it Z Z Z Z 2
The Z cheer goes up with everyone joining in But the
jubilation is short-lived for appearing on the ridge
surrounding the workers is FORMICAS ARMY circling the mass
of workers backing them in towards the roiling water behind
them Formica himself appears in the front lines with
Carpenter and Mandible at his side

FORMICA
Z I should have known All that
work all that preparation come to
nothing All because of one stinking
ant

He steps forward to address the surrounded trapped workers

FORMICA
ALRIGHT WHICH ONE OF YOU IS 2

The workers trembling but silent cower inside the unbroken
circle of soldiers

FORMICA
WHAT ARE YOU DEAF I ASKED YOU
WHERES Z

Formica laughs shaking his head

FORMICA
Folks you may have survived that
flood but theres no way youre
gonna escape from me Ill make you
a deal Hand over the rebel leader
Z and you survive

This sends a ripple of murmurs through the workers

FORMICA
But if you dont hand him over
youre all going to die each and
every singleindividual one of
you

The workers all look at each other

FORMICA
What shall it be workers

The workers remain frightened but silent 2Z trembles
terrified

FORMICA
Have it your way
As Formica raises his swagger stick to order the attack a
lone figure steps out from the crowd

Z
Wait

Z stands there shivering with fear

Z
-Im Z

For a moment Z stands alone under the glare of Formicas
gaze

Then another figure steps out from the throng of workers

WEAVER
No Im Z

Z turns astonished to see Weaver still and unwavering
bravely risking his life for his friend Then AZTECA also
steps forward

AZTECA
Im Z

Next Bala comes forward

BALA

No Im Z

More and more ants step forward

WORKERS
Im Z Im Z Im Zand so is my
brother Ive been Z for weeks now

QUEEN
(regally)
We are Z

Now the workers are all shouting the same declaration

ALL
Iam Z Iam Z I am Z

Z is plainly flabbergasted Formica is outraged He gives
the signal

FORMICA
ATTACK
The army swells forward on all sides pushing the workers
towards the swirling water Some workers surround the Queen
to protect her All seems lost when THE FLY from Insectopia
alights on the rim of the horizon

FLY
Hey guys

THE WASP appears on the other side of the horizon

WASP
Its them

Suddenly on all sides A MASSIVE INSECT ARMY appears on the
ridge looking not unlike ambushing Indians in a John Ford
film Formicas soldiers stop in their tracks awed by the
unfolding spectacle It looks like all of Insectopia has
turned out spiders caterpillars rhinoceros beetles all
manner of creatures crawling and flying have shown up and
now surround the army dwarfing them

WASP
Are these hooligans giving you
trouble 2

FLY
Say the word Z and we kick their
butts

The ant army remains frozen unsure of what to do next
Formica is furious If ants had veins Formicas would be
bulging out of his face

FORMICA

What are you doing ATTACK
(berating his army)

Come on you yellow-bellies
(turning on Carpenter)

Dont just stand there Carpenter
Make an example of yourself

CARPENTER
Uh actually we are outnumbered
sir

Formica turns towards the insects gathered against him With
his chin raised pridefully Formica steps forward and
CHARGES Z

FORMICA
AHHHHHHH
Formica runs so quickly and with such force that his helmet
blows off his head Zs eyes get big he stumbles backwards
slipping and Formica goes flying over him toward the
whirlpool behind He scrabbles at the edge of the water and
then tumbles over

For a moment it looks as if hes gone

FORMICA (0S)
Helphelp me

Z goes to the edge of the precipice and looks over Formica
is struggling in the waters of the very flood he created
which are roiling not far below He looks up into Zs eyes
a new expression crossing his features fear

FORMICA
PleaseII cant swimHelp me

Formica goes under for a bit then his head comes up again --
but hes not going to be able to stay afloat for long

Suddenly he sees a line dropped down Above Z looks down on
him

Z
I thought you said that the life of
one ant doesnt matter

Formica looks at the lineand in that moment seems to
realize his error

FORMICA
I guess it doesto the ant

Formica reaches up and takes the line and is pulled up by Z
and a bunch of other ants (the line we see extends from a
nearby spider one of the cavalry from Insectopia)

Formica is left broken and alone by the precipice while
HORDES OF ANTS surround Z to congratulate him Bala fights
her way to his side and the two of them embrace Then the
ants pick up Z and Bala and CHEERING bear them away

Only Carpenter stays behind He walks up to Formica
carrying his dented and dusty helmet He cleans it the best
he can with his jacket sleeve and hands it to his fallen
general

CARPENTER
Sir if its any consolation I still
think youre completely worthless as
an individual

FADE TO
CLOSE UP OF Z
As he addresses the audience stand-up style

Z
So uh thats pretty much it Just
your basic simple worker overthrows
the government and winds up with the
princess kind of a story
You know there was the big parade
and everything

CUT TO
INT TOWN CENTER - DAY

A HUGE ASSEMBLY OF ANTS applauds as Z who is given a medal by
the Queen

CUT TO
GENERAL FORMICAS FACE looking extremely dispeptic

Z (VO)
General Formica was almost
unemployable He eventually got a
gig as a honeydew keg

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Formica clinging to a wall his belly
hideously distended with honeydew

Z (VO)
The Queen asked me to take over his
job but I said Sorry but Im
really not the general type Im
more the specific type So they
gave the job to Weaver instead

Cut TO

WEAVER in Formicas old office in a generals uniform his
feet up on Formicas desk smoking a cigar Carpenter is on
his hands and knees scrubbing the floor

Z (V0O)
Weaver cut the defense budget in
half Now we only have an army of
five million
cut back to
Z ADDRESSING THE AUDIENCE

Z
And me I guess you could say that I
lived happily ever after

Bala enters the frame embraces and kisses him

Z
I mean Ive got the whole package
right A great life a beautiful
wife and a few kids

BALA
A few

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL
INT ZS HOUSE - DAY

Z and Bala stand in the midst of their living room up to
their knees in THOUSANDS OF CHILD ANTS The children cover
every horizontal surface They run around cry laugh and
tease each other 2Z looks around the room looks back at us
and shrugs

Z
Well so nothings perfect But you
know I wouldnt change a thing

The camera pulls upand away from the groundto reveal
that this whole story has been taking place in a small area
of CENTRAL PARK We pull back and back and see all the
familiar landmarks from the story the bike path the
drinking fountain etc We tilt up into the NEW YORK
SKYLINE BIG MUSICAL FLOURISH

FADE OUT

THE END
