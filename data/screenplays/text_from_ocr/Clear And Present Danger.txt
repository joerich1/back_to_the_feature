The Chief hurries forward -- stares into the cabin

THE SALON (FROM THEIR POV)

It’s a vision straight out of De Sade a man in his
fifties and a younger woman are lying in a tidepool of
their own blood stripped naked slashed and butchered
beyond belief

The salon’s been ravaged too pillows and cushions ripped
apart carpets askew great chunks of paneling torn from
the bulkheads

Then a BOAT ENGINE barks to life off the port bow The
Chief and Seaman run forward just as a jet black Scarab
digs away Two MEN are in the boat both Latins

The Chief whips out his sidearm PUMPS THkx SHOTS after
them turns and yells to his Captain on the cutter

CHIEF
Coming around the bow sir
Killers Stop ‘en

The Scarab arcs around in front of the yacht heading off
and away

The Captain turns to a GUNNER manning a 50 caliber

CAPTAIN —
Fire

The Gunner squeezes the trigger the fifty BELCHES
Slugs tear into the Scarab the boat EXPLODES

A sixth man is standing before them with his back to the
fire He’s in his middle years a simple hardscrabble
face (that masks a fierce determination) Meet the
PRESIDENT of the United States who at this moment is
fuming with indignation 0

PRESIDENT
He was a damn good friend And
one hell of an American teo

The Pres crosses to a table covered with 8x10 photo
blow-ups of the crime scene He picks up one of the shots
grimaces tosses it back zeros in on the Pale Man

PRESIDENT
Mr Director you’re certain these
murderers tie in with them drug
bums

FBI Director EMIL JACOBS nods

JACOBS (PALE MAN)
Yes Mr President Both men had
extensive records of activity within
the Bogota operation

Suddenly the Admiral winces the Pres catches it

PRESIDENT
You all right Admiral

Greer mops his (perspiring) brow

I’m fine sir

PRESIDENT
You agree with the FBI

GREER
I do sir They were definitely in
the employ of the cartels Our
people on station down there have
confirmed it

The President turns back to the fire Greer winces (again)

PRESIDENT
I am sick and tired of those
monkeys I promised the American
people I’d do something about this
drug problem and we haven’t done
squat

He spins back to the room nails Owl Eyes
PRESIDENT

Jimmy I want these goofs to get a
message

National Security Advisor JAMES CUTTER shifts his
considerable bulk

CUTTER
What sort of message Mr president

PRESIDENT
That poison of theirs is gonna stop
flooding in here like piss from a
tall cow

He turns to the Cowboy
- PRESIDENT
Were gonna shut ’em down Judge
And while we’re at it I wouldn’t
mind bustin’ some butt if you know
what I mean

CIA Director Judge ARTHUR MOORE’s eyes ricochet off
Cutter’s back to the Pres

- MOORE (THE COWBOY)
I hear you sir

The Preppy leans forward

PREPPY
Mr President Are you suggesting
a course of action

PRESIDENT
Yeah Ritter I am DO SOMETHING
Let those jaboloneys know we’re all
fed up with their bullshit

WILLIAM RITTER CIA Deputy DirectorOperations shares an
eye with Cutter Cutter turns back to the President

CUTTER
-Sir -- what you’re asking for -- it
can’t be accomplished through
routine police agencies

The Pres waves a hand at Greer Ritter and the Judge

PRESIDENT

What the hell you think I got CIA

here for
MOORE

But Mr President even we have
limits in this kind of effort

CUTTER
This type of endeavor requires
maximum resources

PRESIDENT
Interpret that for me please
CUTTER
Sir either our national security is
threatened by these people or it is

not

PRESIDENT
Yeah well J said that too
didn’t I

CUTTER
Yes sir you did

The President turns looks at the fire then turns back to
the others

PRESIDENT
Boys let’s just put it this way I
want some pay-back -- and y’all
better see I get it

He starts out of the room Cutter and Ritter exchange a
conspiratorial look Greer catches it -- then he suddenly

coofs out a breath -- starts to rise -- clutches his middie
-- and crashes to the floor groaning

GREER

That sounds like a no Captain
COLLINS

Judging by your cholecystogram I

suspect the tumor is -- mature

GREER
Too big to slice into

COLLINS
(nods)
That would be my opinion sir

A beat then Ryan jumps in impatient

RYAN
So what’s the prognosis
He looks to Greer shakes his head in apology

RYAN

word

present danger to the security of
the United States

make it more effective -- youll get
blown sure as hell

RITTER
I know the drill man
He checks his watch takes an envelope out of a briefcase

passes it to the man who opens it glances inside

MAN

concern

I got to tell you I don’t like it

RITTER
We don’t pay you to like it Clark
He walks off CLARK sucks a tooth

EXT A HACIENDA (OUTSIDE BOGOTA) - NIGHT

It’s a huge rambling adobe sprawled across a mountain top
surrounded by walled gardens festooned with concertina
wire and blinding floodlights sort of Frank Lioyd Wright
meets Ludwig the Mad

INT THE MAIN SALON OF THE HACIENDA

Two men are in the room One is behind a desk mid-40’s a
patron-type right down to the white suit and stiletto
cigar The other guy’s younger slicker soap
operahandsone

PATRON
It’s none of your business why we
did it He had it coming -- that’s
all you have to know

HANDSOME
I understand Patron but I
repeat The man was extremely close
to their White House

PATRON
(sniles)
That doesn’t surprise me

HANDSOME

PATRON

Forget it Cortez it’s over

Colonel CARLOS CORTEZ shakes his head

CORTEZ (HANDSOME)
No Senor Escobedo it’s not

ERNESTO ESCOBEDO sits up the line got his attention

ESCOBEDO (PATRON)
Why do you say that

CORTEZ
There’s a rumor in play Some
people within their government are
advocating an offensive against you

What are you telling me The United
eee is going to declare war on
us

CORTEZ
Not a war -- not in the open at
least But the possibility of
covert retaliation is very real

Escobedo takes a beat

ESCOBEDO (THE MAN)
Youve confirmed this

- CORTEZ
My sources believe it’s true

Escobedo sits back fires up his cigar
ESCOBEDO

So ine’ do you suggest we react to
such a threat

- CORTEZ
I have a plan It’ll be
expensive
° ESCOBEDO

Mmmm with you it’s always
expensive How much

CORTEZ
Three million perhaps to begin

ESCOBEDO
And what’s this three million buy

us
CORTEZ
Men arms -- vehicles
ESCOBEDO
And who’ll lead these men Colonel
CORTEZ
I will of course
ESCOBEDO

pleasures of Washington for the
hazards of the field

INT THE DIRECTOR’S OFFICE

Judge Moore is behind his desk Ryan’s standing across
from hin

MOORE
Look Jack I know how you feel
about him -- I feel the same way
But we-both know his chances of
making it are pretty damn slin
And our business here is to serve
the country He wants you to
succeed him And I think you’re
ready for it What do you think

RYAN
I -- I don’t know Judge I suppose
I am technically but I lack
political sophistication

MOORE

You’1ll pick that up

(sniles)
Besides politics aren’t supposed to
have much place in what we do here
The important thing is the
President likes you and The Hill
likes you 50

The Judge’s INTERCOM BUZZES he leans into the box

MOORE
Yeah

WOMAN’S VOICE
(amplified)
Mr Ritter’s here

MOORE
Send hin in

The door opens and Ritter enters

MOORE
(at Ritter)

Hello Bob
(nods)
Judge

MOORE
You’re just in time I’m about to
appoint Dr Ryan Acting Deputy
Director Intelligence

Ritter tries to hide his surprise

RITTER
Really

His eyes hit Ryan’s they share a look it’s obvious
there’s no leve lost between these two

2 MOORE
The appointment’s provisional of
course If James recovers wants to
come back well and good But in
the meantime weve got an excelient
replacement

RITTER
Yes of course

Moore picks up a letter rises

MOORE
I’ve ginned up a memo for your
Gepartment heads Here’s your copy

Ryan takes it from hin

MOORE
Did the Admiral have a chance to
fill you in on the Camp David
session

RYAN
Yes sir

MOORE

So you know the President’s calling
for a full-court press on this one

(as Ryan nods)
I want you and your people all over
it I want to know who bought the
hit -- who signed their death
warrants

RYAN
I understand sir

Ryans eyes flicker off Ritter back to Moore who extends
his hand

MOORE
You’ve got some big boots to fill
Doctor Good luck

Ryan shakes the Judge’s hand

RYAN
Thank you sir

He starts out of the office

RITTER
Ryan

Ryan stops turns back

RITTER
Need-to-know still applies

RYAN
-Of course

Ryan walks out Ritter turns to Moore shaking his head

RITTER
Too soon Judge You brought him
along too fast

MOORE

(sniles)
Come on Bobby -- you got a hard-on
for him because he’s been involved
with two highly successful field
operations You’re OP’s -- and
you hate getting poached on I
understand that But we can’t have
Intelligence going adrift just
because you want 2 keep him out of
some loop Right

Ritter nods grudgingly
RITTER
I guess
EXT A MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN - NIGHT

The screen is black -- but it isn’t matte it’s more
organic -- as if the darkness were alive

We HEAR a man’s voice OVER

He CLICKS the radio off gestures 0S Two more troopers
come forward he points to the right and left The grunts
nod and hurry OUT OF FRAME

ANOTHER ANGLE

Back to the Soldier as he moves through the darkness in a
tight crouch exaggerating his steps putting each foot
down carefully silently

FLASH CUT - We SEE the Soldier illuminated through a pair
of night goggles

BACK TO SCENE

The Soldier stops -- his head swivels slowly -- something’s
bothering him he doesn’t know what FLASH CUT -- The
night goggles POV

BACK TO SCENE

The Soldier takes a moment shakes it off and continues
forward pausing 20 yards from the campfire where he
kneels sights his rifle on the sentry and FIRES A
(SILENCED) ROUND

The sentry drops like a stone

The man at the fire starts to get up -- the Soldier FIRES
again the man goes down with a thud The three guys who
were Sleeping come out of their bedrolis groping for their
weapons

The two other troopers that the Captain sent forward spring
out of the darkness and RIDDLE the three men

The Soldier rises shoulders his weapon

CLARK (V0)
Kid you are very good

The Soldier jerks around startled Clark grins at hin
i

SOLDIER
Who the fuck are you

Floodlights suddenly pop on illuminating the (training)
area The five dead men are back on their feet removing
their flak jackets picking off the wax bullets they took
during the action

Clark gestures at the Soldier

CLARK
Come on

They walk over to the Captain and his men

CLARK
Well score that one a success
Captain I liked your discipline on
the approach and your move on the
objective was excellent

He gestures at the Soldier
CLARK
This point man you have is terrific
He almost picked me up
The Soldier lays a hard eye on Clark who smiles and holds
up a pair of night goggles

CLARK
I cheated kid I froze every time
your head turned What you heard
was my breathing

Clark sticks out a hand
Name’s Clark

The Soldier shakes his hand

CHAVEZ
Sergeant Chavez sir Can I ask a
question

CLARK
Shoot

CHAVEZ
What are we training for

CLARK

signed on as crew for Hardin The
ire sailed from
Lauderdale on the 14th

SECOND AGENT
Small crew for such a big boat

JACOBS
The man was on his honeymoon --

Moira Gomez my executive assistant

Ryan and Moira share a nod he settles into a chair next to

Murray

JACOBS
(at Ryan)
So what do you make of the
killings
RYAN

I’d say they were executions sir

JACOBS
Colombian cowboys hit a respectable
American businessman

RYAN
You’re assuming he was respectable

MURRAY
You’re assuming he wasn’t

RYAN
I ran his numbers -- there was very
little substance to his empire
All of the deals were shells -- most
of them gone belly up In fact I
couldnt find any cash at all
Anywhere

SMITH
He must have had some income How
could he afford to run that yacht

RYAN
Good question By the way where is
t

MURRAY
Miami I had it sealed until we
could check it out

RYAN
Let’s do it

MURRAY
How’s tomorrow

RYAN
Set it up

° MURRAY
Moira

She nods makes a note Jacobs sits back studies Ryan

th President were big-time buddies

RYAN
No

GREER
So what if your hunch doesn’t pan
out

Ryan frowns Greer nods

GREER
I know -- they always do But
what if this one doesn’t If the
old man hears youre investigating
his pal and the guy turns up
clean -- you have just stepped into
very deep pile of horseshit

He passes Ryan the notebook
GREER
The time to tell him is when -- and
if -- you got the goods on Hardin

RYAN

RYAN

GREER

somebody has to get into his box in
a hurry

RYAN
But that’s not why

GREER
Nope it isn’t I have it because
I don’t trust the son-of-a-bitch

The squad of Hispanic-American soldiers (from the earlier
SCENE) start pouring out of the chopper The men have
switched their camouflage fatigues for tan khaki each
grunt is loaded to the gills with weapons and ammo

Eight men come out -- then Chavez -- followed by his
Captain As each man hits the ground they turn hard left
to avoid the tail rotor -- race ten steps from the helo --
and drop to their bellies under the whirling blade

The Crewman shouts into the helicopter

- CREWMAN

Clear Clear Clear
The chopper’s ENGINES WHINE -- the main rotor CHURNS
whipping up a hundred-knot downwash The copter lifts off

and in the blink of an eye its spectral shape vanishes
into the night sky

Clark hurries over and ducks down next to the Captain

The shattered remains of the white Caddy limo (that Chavez
sighted on) are spread out over the floor of the shed

of metal and trim studying them placing them back
picking up another

Finally a torn section of roof panel attracts his careful
attention S

What happens to a car when you set
eff a bomb inside it

CLARK
It explodes -

RYAN
Ex-plodes

Clark nods Ryan holds up the roof section traces a finger
along the ragged edge of the painted surface

It’s part of the roof panel -- the
edges curl down -- not up

DIEGO
You’re suggesting it was a
bomb that landed on the car

RYAN

DIEGO
But then where are the bomb
fragments We’ve searched the area
with great care None have been
found -- not a trace

RYAN
Well keep looking Captain -- they
have to be there

We HEAR a COPTER WHOPPING IN overhead

A Jet Ranger circles a pad sets down Two security-types
drop to the tarmac big mean apes with shoulderholstered
Mac’s over their Hawaiian shirts Then Cortez steps out in
full uniform followed by Escobedo in a flowing white
trenchcoat

Two of the military-types in Ryan’s party excuse themselves
and hurry over to the new arrivals handshakes and bear
hugs all around

crouch moving into the action

CLARK
Chavez No

A STREAM of BULLETS rains in -- Clark ducks down starts
after Chavez -- the stream becomes a TORRENT

Clark BANGS off a CLIP -- the torrent turns into a FLOOD
There’s no way he can move forward so he backs off
trailing intothe jungle

firefight -- gestures to a soldier who steps near hin

SIPO

The soldier nods waves to his squad they vanish into the
night OUT OF FRAME

the night goggles The Captain and his seven guys are
knee-deep in shit and running out of ammo

Sipo’s troopers rush in behind them and open FIRE Three
of the ninjas go down (one dead two wounded) The Captain
and the four others fight their way out of the trap and
fall back to the cane line

Sipo’s men start in after them but the Major calls them
off -

Clark follows the action with the goggles then PANS BACK
to the plant

Chavez is standing in the middle of the clearing his hands «
up flanked by two of Sipo’s thugs

absolute control of the product
And to show good faith I1l
unilaterally reduce cocaine
shipments to your country by half

Not good enough He wants it
stopped

CORTEZ

He couldn’t be that naive We all
know it will never stop If your

it possible But at least now I
can regulate the trade -- minimize
the dislocation of your cities --

with what we had to do down there

RYAN
But you didn’t have to All you
had to do was notify Congress --
go it covertly -- but legally

PRESIDENT
You really think them yahoos up
there would’ve went along with it

RYAN
They might have

PRESIDENT
When donkeys fly Look if you’re
gonna be as successful as I think

you could be you gotta know

somepin’ Congress is one big swamp
You fall in there you never climb
out You want to get things done in
this town sometimes you can’t cross
all the T’s -- dot all the I’s So

RYAN
So you broke the rules sir And
as Acting Deputy Director of
Intelligence it’s my duty to report
it to the House Intelligence
Oversight Committee

PRESIDENT
Whoa Hold the phone youre
reporting me Ryan

RYAN
You’re damn right I am sir

PRESIDENT
(heating up)
You can’t talk to me that way

RYAN
I take no pleasure in it But those
men who died in that op had a right
to expect you to perform your duties
in an honorable manner

The President rears up out of his chair

PRESIDENT
(boiling)
How dare you come into this office
-- this sacred chamber -- and bark
at me like some junkyard dog I AM
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA This is my country

There’s a picture window behind the President We can SEE
the Washington Memorial -- the Lincoln Memorial -- the
Jefferson Memorial the Capitol beyond

Ryan looks out at the icons of our liberty waves a hand
across the panorama

RYAN
Youre dead wrong about that
It’s their country -- our
country And as long as I serve
it it’s going to stay that way

He turns starts for the door

- PRESIDENT
Ryan
Ryan stops turns back the Pres smiles
PRESIDENT

Come on I know you’re not going
through with this

RYAN oO

PRESIDENT
‘Cause you’re too damn smart You

big game -- suddenly youre a major
threat You could nail my hide to
fe barn -- but you’re not gonna do
te

RYAN

PRESIDENT
Nope I peg you as a fella who uses
his bean You’re gonna tuck that
chip away -- save it for a time when
your own fat’s in the fire And
then you whip it out -- I cash it in
-- life goes on The ol’ Potomac
two-step Jack

(winks)

That‘’s the jig for us

Ryan stares at him a moment shakes his head

RYAN
Sorry Mr President I don’t dance

He turns walks out the Pres frowns

EXT THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

A light rain is falling Ryan comes through a pedestrian
security gate walks down to Pennsylvania Avenue pauses
looks back out at Jefferson and Lincoln and Washington
takes a moment then nods as if satisfied that he’s spoken
for them and for us

Ryan turns pulls up his coat collar walks off into the
rain

FADE OUT
