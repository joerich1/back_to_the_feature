INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

THE THOMPSON FAMILY is sitting down at the dinner table

the table to view each member of the Thompson family
First we see Billy a slightly pudgy 18 year old boy
Next we see Tommy a 6 year old boy very young and sweet
looking We then see Tamara The mother of the family

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Joe Tamara and Billy are at the table in a heated

argument Tamara is still yelling at Billy

TAMARA
Why do you have to be such a bad

influence on your little brother

BILLY
I dont try to influence him at
all

JOE
You taught him the F word at the

dinner table

BILLY

TAMARA

JOE

BILLY

JOE
Get back here

INTBEDROOM - A BIT LATER

Tommy is in his bed he is getting annoyed by the

screaming and starts tossing and turning

TAMARA (0S)

You need to set him straight

JOE (0OS)
How am I supposed to do that

He’s impossible
TAMARA (0S)
You are suppose to be the dad

grow a pair and figure it out

Tommy puts a WHITE pillow over his head to block out the
sound of his family yelling The closet door opens very

slowly

JOE (0OS)
Honey he is going through alot

You know the move was hard on him

TAMARA (0S)
Hard on him That’s the first time
I’ve heard you and hard-on in a

sentence in a long time

JOE (0OS)
Sweety

By this point the closet door is completely open and a
MASKED FIGURE is seen he steps slightly into the light
of the night light so you can see his mask He is holding

a knife and begins to approach the bed

TAMARA (0S)
Look I have a lot to do tomorrow
I need to go take a shower and
then get to bed You better take
care of Billy

JOE (0S)
I just think you are being hard on

him

TAMARA (0S)
Either you punish Billy or I will

punish you
The masked figure has now climbed up on the bed and
straddled Tommy He lifts the knife into the air and
stabs into the pillow 3 times Feathers fly into the air
and the pillow begins to turn red with blood He then
starts repeatedly stabbing the body as the blanket begins
to turn red with blood He peels back the covers to
reveal dead Tommy horribly disfigured He then takes

Tommy and stuffs him into a pillow case The pillow case

is immediately soaked with blood

JOE (0S)

How

TAMARA (0S)
Do you really want to find out how
long I will go without sleeping

with you

JOE (0S)

I will take care of it

The masked figure wipes off his bloody knife on the
blanket He then picks up the bloody pillow case with
Tommy inside He then slings the pillow case over his
shoulder He then walks over to the night light He
squats down and you can see his full mask He then
reaches and pulls the night light out of the wall The

room goes completely black

INT BILLYS BEDROOM

Billy is on his laptop He is lying on his bed and there
is porn on his computer One hand is in his pants He is

hunched over the computer with his back to his door
The doorknob slowly turns and then slowly opens

Billys face reflects the GLOW of the computer screen
The Masked Man is sneaking up behind him and raising his

knife

The Masked Man Places the pillowcase with Tommy inside at
the foot of the bed

His computer starts to play a song Right when the song
drops the Masked Man stabs Billy in the neck Billy
stands up with a look of shock on his face as massive
amounts of blood squirt out of the open wound in his
neck The blood sprays on the walls Billy staggers
towards the masked man and trips over the pillowcase

causing him to fall face first into his bed
There is a KNOCK on the door

JOE(OS)
Billy Can I come in I need to

talk to you
The Masked Man GRUNTS and turns to face the door
The door knob turns slightly but is locked

JOE(OS) (CONTD)
Why is your door locked Are you
masturbating again Ill give you
ten seconds to put your junk back
in your pants then I am coming in
I have the key to this door you

know

The Masked Man pulls the phone charger out of the wall
and slowly wraps the charger cord around his hands and
pulls it tightly He then stands where he can hide behind
the door when it opens After he gets in position the
door opens and hides him perfectly Joe walks forward
towards his dead son He kneels down in front and hovers
over his son’s body The door closes fast behind him but
doesnt make a noise The Masked Man pads silently into
position behind Joe Joe looks down at the pillow case
He opens it and a horrified look befalls his face He
then vomits on the ground as we show Tommy within the

pillowcase

JOE (CONTD)
Oh my god My boys

Joe begins to cry The Masked Man puts the cord of the
cellphone charger around Joes neck Joe starts to
struggle The Masked Man puts his knee on Joes back and
pulls up After a long struggle and a lot of shaking Joe
is finally lifeless The Masked Man plugs the phone
charger back into the wall and then walks towards the
door He then turns off the light and the SCREEN GOES
BLACK again

INT BATHROOM

Tamara is in the shower The curtain is drawn The
Masked Man throws open the curtains and stabs Tamara
repeatedly As we look at the drain and Tamaras feet
blood pours down the drain as in “Psycho” Then some
little chunks of flesh Finally some intestines fall to
the drain and cover it Tamara collapses on top of the

drain

EXT HOUSE NIGHT

Seen from behind the Masked Man is walking away from the

house He stuffs his mask gloves and knife into a bag

EXT ALLEY — DAWN

The Masked Man climbs over a wall

EXT BACK YARD - DAWN

We follow the masked man from behind as he walks through

the back yard to the back door of a house

INT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

He sneaks in and walks through the dark house He gets to

a door and opens it

INT ADAM’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He puts his bag down in his closet CLOSE ANGLE ON DESK
We see his hand grab a journal off of the desk The
journal has MY PURE JOY written across it

We PAN around the room It looks like your average

teenagers room

We see teenager ADAM sit down on his bed and start to

write in his journal

ADAM (VO)
Entry 12 His mother was a jackal
his father was a cuckold and he
himself was I Tonight I was
killed and tonight I am reborn I
watched a grown man’s hope die I
cured him by putting him out of
his misery I think no one should
have to bury their own kids
Norman Bates is proud of me Four
stones for four drones an empty
doll house the nuclear family

I am dirty but tomorrow I’1l be
just dirt”

There is a knock on Adams door

ADAMS MOM (0S)

She tries to open the door

ADAMS MOM (0S) (CONTD)

ADAM

Adam gets up from his bed and places the diary back on
his desk He opens his dresser drawer and starts looking

through it He picks out a shirt and changes into it

Adam then grabs some AXE DEODORANT from the top of his
dresser and sprays it on He sprays it on his pants too
and into his pants He looks at himself in the mirror He
takes off his shirt and flexes a little then throws it

back on He then messes up his hair

Adam picks up his back pack from the closet The mask is
seen poking out of the bag next to it on the floor of the

closet CAMERA remains focused on the mask

bitch thats giving you mad dick

wet

ADAM
That goes without saying but dude
now a days you get into a room
alone with a chick if she likes
you shes gonna suck your dick so
that goes without saying Its way
easier to find a chick that you
can get your nut from then to find
a chick thats down to watch some
gorey ass Takashi Miikie horror

movies man “Audition” or “Ichi

the Killer” The best shit is
comin’ from foreign countries
bro Bitches just arent down with

the subtitles and the gore

CHRIS

Inside” It was French That shit

ADAM
That the one where they rip the
baby out of the chicks tummy

CHRIS

ADAM
I liked that one but not as much
as I liked that other French movie
“Martyrs” They skin some bitch

fuckin gnarly

CHRIS
Oh Yeah That was almost as
gnarley as when a bitch doesnt
shave her pussy I mean like what

have some type of hair down there
like a landing strip or something

of 7 But how would you know

anyway you are a virgin

Adam makes a surprised face
Chris
Hahaha I don’t know what’s
funnier the fact that you called
me a virgin when you’ve walked in
on me fucking a girl or the fact
that you referred to girls as dick

wet

Adam
Objectifying women rules They
aren’t actually people they are

dick wet
Chris laughs

CHRIS
AnywaysI dont know when it
comes to horror I dont think
anything is more terrifying then
Alfred Hitchcocks “Psycho”
Norman Bates is the shit and
Hitchcock totally flips the whole
antagonist and protagonist thing
on its head because you are
actually following and rooting for
the bad guy the entire film Not
to mention that shower scene is

pure genius
Adam laughs

ADAM

CHRIS

fire today and she wants to drink
with me at the party I think imma

ADAM

neck and pulls on it

ADAM
How would you get out of that

Steve struggles a little bit and then stops

STEVE

CHRIS
Dude you should have pulled the
lever on the side of your seat and
let your seat fall back on him
Thats what I would have done

Dont you know anything

ADAM

True

STEVE
Man I saw that happen in The
Godfather someone gets strangled
while they’re sitting in the front

take someone’s phone charger as
evidence No one would ever think

thats a murder weapon

ADAM
Pretty much I bet I could get out
of it
STEVE
I doubt that
ADAM
Try me
STEVE
Fine

Adam and Steve both get out of the car again and switch
seats Steve takes the charger and wraps it around Adams
neck Adam pulls the lever on the side of the chair and
the back reclines suddenly and crushes Steve a little

Chris hands the bottle back to Adam

EXT BACKYARD - NIGHT

A house party is occurring with a DJ and a foam machine
There are a lot of people in the back yard drinking and
playing beer pong Adam is seen at the beer pong table
He is winning There is only one cup on the other side in

hand

ADAM

HAT KID

TWO FINE GIRLS (CONNIE and FRIEND) are standing near the
beer pong table checking Adam out We FREEZE FRAME

ADAM (VO) (CONTD)
So I have two options right now
A I can talk to the blond who may
or may not have chlamydia because
by the looks of her bitch’s pussy
loose I dont know much but I do
know Connie puts out A LOT Or B
I can talk to the cute friend
thats wearing a little to much
makeup but that’s probably to
cover up some skin shit Either
option seems sure fire to get me
laid

Adam turns around and sees CINDY coming out of the foam
She walks towards him in SLOW MOTION

ADAM(VO) (CONTD)
I guess its option C Cindy

probably end up jerking it into a
towel at the end of the night

ADAM (CONTD)

Hey Cindy How are you

CINDY

We never talk anymore

ADAM
I know Its all my bad Im

sorry

an unreal world of actors Boys
playing men guys playing bitches

No one knows what they are or who

I am but they will always know -
I am I am grotesque My skin is
porcelain and my true face is my
mask When the last breath of life
is spit from a man’s chest I take
it from him And I pierce her
innocence like the ripe fruit of
the harvest before it turns and
sickens me I have come to take
what is already dead I am death’s
lover a necromantic and death
never fakes an orgasm I am the
judge Osiris and I fucking hate
rotten poseurs and their horrible
rhymes I will impose Draconian
law upon all that have wronged me
I am the taker of lives I am Adam

CHRIS
Hold up

Chris takes a bong rip and then coughs a little

CHRIS (CONTD)

“Darde Divorce” That shit is so
terribly acted like probably the
worst acting ever Like Im not
really even sure what the movie is
about or if half of the characters
were speaking English But theres
a part in the movie where this
dude hits this one fool who is
tied up in the face with a shovel
and he knocks off the guys jaw
and then he cuts off the dude’s
fingers and the top of the dude’s
head and then eats his eyeball

ADAM
Woah

STEVE

CHRIS
You knocked out You were way too

drunk after the party

You are so fuckin’ insensitive

ADAM
Dude that was fucked up You

CHRIS
It’s no biggie bro You will
probably just be questioned a
little by the police

ADAM
Why

CHRIS
Well you do have a motive Not
like you did it though man It
doesnt matter They will probably
just talk to everyone who was at

the party and shit

ADAM (VO)

Derron have a fight I need a fall

guy

STEVE

ADAM
Dude I dont wanna think about
Cindy right now Can we talk about

CHRIS
How about “Darde Divorce” Shit

ex-husband killing his ex-wife

ADAM
Are you sure its gorier then
“Premutos Lord of the Living

Dead”

CHRIS
Its way gorier because it

actually looks realistic

STEVE
I dunno “Premutos” was pretty
fuckin’ dope They had a body

count meter

CHRIS
This serial killer has a body

count bro

ADAM
Yeah

CHRIS
Yeah man they attached him to
like 20 different kills At 13
different places Man if I was him
Id kill another time because 13

is unlucky as hell
Adam takes a bong rip

ADAM

You are way too superstitious

STEVE
They are probably gonna end up

making a movie about this guy

ADAM
You really think so

Chris takes a bong rip

CHRIS
Fuck yeah They are saying this
guy is demented as hell I mean he
killed twice in the past two days
and he doesnt even discriminate
about who hes going to kill Men
women children teenagers
Everyones fucked I bet he would
even kill a dog if someone had

one

ADAM
I doubt he would kill a dog That
is way too sick Killing a dog is

horrible

CHRIS

Steve hands Chris the blunt and he guts it He dumps the
tobacco into the trash Chris hands him back the blunt

Squidward I mean think of all

your favorite kids’ movies and

then imagine if they were gory
Are you telling me you wouldnt
watch a rated R version of “Mary
Poppins” where MsPoppins gets
naked in some scenes and brutally
kills all the kids shes
babysitting Now that would be for
the chiefing

mean I am going to change who I
am Watching “Nekromantik” has
nothing to do with her These

ADAM

between movies and reality

and makes sure its warm He takes off his clothes and
enters the bath Adam is holding a knife He plays with
the blade on his skin while he waits for the bath to fill
up As the water fills he dunks the knife into the water

He closes his eyes and there is a flash of light

INT ADAM’S FATHERS ROOM

ADAMS FATHER A very sickly looking older man is laying
in bed and Adam is sitting in a chair beside him

‘Driller Killer’ is playing on the TV

ADAM
Can we watch something else I’m

getting sick of horror movies

ADAMS FATHER
But this was one of the first

slasher movies ever made

ADAM
Really

ADAMS FATHER
Yup when I was younger I saw this
one in theaters with my friends
and we were in a theater that held
100 people By the time the film
was over we were the only ones
left in the theater

ADAM

Whyd everyone leave

ADAMS FATHER
At the time the film was
considered to0 violent See that’s

the fucking thing Aadam If you

want people to remember something
you have to shock them or scare
them The only way to get through
to people is through fear

ADAM
What about through comedy

ADAMS FATHER
No People only truly remember
what scares them Dread and fear
that’1l stick with you forever If
you really want to impact
someone’s life you have to terrify
them

ADAM

I guess you’re right

ADAMS FATHER
These horror movies They are
going to stick with you forever

because you fear them

INT BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

ADAM
Jesus Fucking Christ I was just

think this behavior is okay Its

because of all those awful movies

ADAM
Keep talking and your jugular

ADAMS MOM

You need to treat me with respect

ADAM

Adam’s mom shakes her head sighs and leaves the

bathroom

ADAMS MOM

machine when you are done

Adam laughs He looks at the knife in his hand and
continues mopping up the water on the ground with his
foot

totally ignores the things I do

for him

JOE
Well he is still a teen Its not
your fault he acts this way You

just need to take him to therapy

room with this motherfucker when
he abandoned us Where was he when
dad was sick Where was he when
dad died

JOE
I was in rehab Adam Do you
really think dad only affected
you He changed all of our lives
I couldnt be at home I couldnt
see him like that Even though me
and dad never got along I
couldnt see him like that

ADAM

(crying)
Mom was always at work You left
home I was left here with dad He
was my hero you know Do you know
how hard it is to watch your hero
wither away in front of you I
watched him go from a big strong
guy he was like super man to a
fuckin concentration camp victim
He use to be our baseball coach
Now all we could do together is
watch movies Thats all we did
Watched movies They were our
escape Dad could still talk about
the movies better then anyone
else His favorites were horror I
would come home everyday from
school and go to his room and we
would watch a movie As he got
sicker he wouldnt be able to even

get through the full movie

anymore The sicker he got the
more he asked about you He would
ask me where you were What was I
suppose to say I didnt know
Then one day I came home from
school and went to his room like
I did every day before it and he
wasnt there I screamed “Dad” a
few times and he didnt answer
Then I wandered into my room and
there he was Laying on the floor
Holding my baseball glove I
nudged him a little I thought he
was joking But he wasnt He
died in my room With no one
there And the last thing he
wanted to do was play catch with
his boys I was just a kid when
this happened But you were the
one who couldnt see him like
that

JOE
Adam I didnt know I was on
drugs I sobered up I didnt know
you had to go through that

ADAM
Well fucking save it I dont
need you to feel sorry for me You
should have been here you

werent Thats it

ADAMS MOM
Adam he is here now and trying to

be a part of this family

ADAM

ADAMS MOM

world and in it we are stilla

ADAMS MOM
Adam

ADAM
Shut your fuckin’ mouth before I

JOE
Oh so you think you’re real tuff
Threatening a woman If only Dad

were here to set you straight

ADAM
How the fuck would you know what
Dad would do Dad would whoop your
ass for missing his fuckin’
funeral thats what he would do

JOE
Look I am sorry Adam but you
dont have to throw a temper
tantrum Act like an adult

Adam sits

ADAMS MOM
Adam your brother is sorry Can

peace
ADAM

Sure

back down
ADAMS MOM

Thank you Adam And if you still
want to Joseph you can stay

here

JOE
I would love to but its only
till I get back on my feet Dont

you worry

Adam laughs

JOE (CONTD)

What is so funny

ADAM
Im just picturing stabbing you
repeatedly Not in a vital spot so
it would kill you instantly but
in many different spots so you
would die of blood loss and pain
instead of instantly Id let you
slowly bleed out

JOE
What the fuck did you say to me

ADAM
I would let you slowly bleed out

JOE
Ill fuck you up Adam Im your
older brother Fuckin’ remember
that

ADAM
I would let you slowly bleed out

Adam stands up and leaves the dinner table

ADAMS MOM

Where are you going

ADAM
Out

ADAMS MOM
Where

ADAM
To Chris’

ADAMS MOM

You were just at Chris’

ADAM

Like I give a fuck

ADAMS MOM
Yeah well you spend all your

time there and I haven’t even met

the kid
ADAM
Bye
Adam leaves the room
JOE

What the fuck was all that He
needs help
ADAMS MOM
Ive sent him to therapy but he
acts completely fine in front of
therapists He just talks normally
and about movies He doesnt

mention any of his problems

JOE
Does he usually threaten violence
like that

ADAMS MOM
Yeah but he would never actually

hurt anyone

JOE

Has he ever laid a hand on you

ADAMS MOM

No He has never hurt anyone or

anything nothing about fighting
at school or anythingI dont

understand why he owns a knife

though Probably to feel tuff or
maybe he is afraid of the person
who killed his friends

JOE

How do you know he owns a knife

ADAMS MOM
He pulled it out on me and
threatened me with it today when I
asked him to clean up the bathroom
after he accidently flooded the
bathroom and didn’t want to clean

it up

JOE
He pulled a fucking knife out on
you Mom and you didnt call the

cops

ADAMS MOM
He is just stressed out He isnt

abusive physically

JOE
Well he sure is verbally Verbal
abuse is still abuse and a knife
threat no matter how serious is
still a threat against someone’s
life How do you know he would
never actually go through with it

Mom

ADAMS MOM
I just know Joseph And he didnt
pull the knife on me He just had
it closed in his hand and made
threats

JOE
You sound like a battered wife

again He is turning into Dad

ADAMS MOM
No he isnt he is just upset

some of his friends died

JOE
There you go making up excuses for
Adam just like you use to for
Dad It runs in this family How
do you know he isnt going to
start hitting you like Dad used

to
ADAMS MOM
Adam is a kind soul He is just

upset

JOE

He is his fathers son

ADAMS MOM
Dont say that

Adams mom starts crying Joe gives her a hug

JOE
Its gonna be ok Mom Ill be
here awhile Im going to change
up the dynamic Ill make sure he
behaves better He needs therapy
again A good therapist But the
first thing he needs is for us to

take that knife away from him

INT ADAMS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Joe and Adams mom are searching through Adams room

After looking for a while they stop

ADAMS MOM
He probably still has it on him

JOE

True Is that a journal

Joe points to the journal Labeled “Mypurejoy” on the
desk

ADAMS MOM
Yeah thats Adams journal He
has been writing in it a lot
lately

JOE
Why dont we take a peek inside to
find out what has been going on
with him lately

ADAMS MOM
How would you feel if someone read

your private diaries

JOE
I dont go around threatening

peoples lives

Joe grabs the journal

ADAMS MOM
You really shouldnt Joe

JOE
It will probably do us some good
to know what has been going on
with him Maybe he has been having
thoughts of suicide He seemed
off

Joe opens the journal

ADAMS MOM
Fine But just to make sure he is
okay
JOE
Of course
JOE
(reading)

Entry 1 I had been watching a
lot of movies lately more then
usual but whats funny is they

just arent as entertaining

anymore I watch these gory horror
movies and I sit here thinking I
could do that

ADAMS MOM
He wants to be a film maker when

he grows up

JOE
Thats nice Mom I’m gonna keep
reading and I sit here
thinking I could do that I can
challenge people’s limits and
minds I can make something gory
I can kill people too Today I
decided that watching these movies
isnt enough for me I had to go
out and make something I had to
make art I went out and bought a
white mask and painted over it
today The perfect mask for a
killer I saw someone I didnt
particularly like while I was at
the store She reminded me of my
mom I followed her home After I

painted over the mask I returned

to their house A look of shock
came on the womans face when I
entered her house completely

masked

ADAMS MOM
It doesnt say that

JOE

Yes it does Mom He is sick

ADAMS MOM

Adam wouldnt hurt anyone

A look of

JOE
(reading)

I killed her “Ichi the Killer”-
style Sliced off her nipples and
then cut her throat The next one
will be more planned out When I
got home I threw my mask in the
closet Tomorrow night will be
Jason Voorhees themed Machete

time
shock comes across Joe and Adams Moms face

ADAMS MOM
Adam wouldnt he is probably

just writing a story

JOE
You said someone killed his

friends

ADAMS MOM
I know for a fact he wouldnt do
that He was like in love with the

girl that died

JOE
Well why dont we read the last
entry then

ADAMS MOM
No

JOE

Mom we have to

ADAMS MOM

I dont want to know anymore

JOE
Mom we have to Entry 13 I am
the first and the last the alpha

and the omega in an unreal world
of actors Boys playing men guys
playing bitches No one knows what
they are or who I am but they
will always know - I am I am
grotesque My skin is porcelain
and my true face is my mask When
the last breath of life is spit
from a man’s chest I take it from
him And I pierce her innocence
like the ripe fruit of the
harvest before it turns and
sickens me I have come to take
what is already dead I am death’s
lover a necromantic and death
never fakes an orgasm I am the
judge Osiris and I fucking hate
rotten poseurs and their horrible
rhymes I will impose Draconian
law upon all that have wronged me
I am the taker of lives I am Adam

and he was Derron

ADAMS MOM
He didnt kill them

JOE
Maybe you are right but there’s
enough reasonable doubt here to
warrant a search of his stuff
Did they have anything about the
killer

ADAMS MOM
They showed what his mask looked

like He was caught on tape

Joe opens the closet sees the mask and picks it up He

turns and shows it to his mother
JOE
Did it look like this

ADAMS MOM
(gulps )
Yes

JOE

Are you sure
Adams mom starts crying

ADAMS MOM

Yes

JOE

Mom you need to call the police

ADAMS MOM

No He is my son

JOE

He is a fucking serial killer

ADAMS MOM

He is my son

JOE
He is a fucking serial killer You
need to call the police on him

Mom please You are in denial

ADAMS MOM
No Joseph we need to give him a

chance to explain

JOE
Mom call the cops There is

nothing to explain

Joseph hands his mother his phone

JOE (CONT ’D)
Ill give you a moment before I

just call myself

Adams Mom sits down on the bed holding the mask and
breaks down crying After a moment Joseph sits next to

his mom and tries to comfort her

JOE (CONTD)
Its gonna be okay Mom Just call
the cops

Adam enters the room

ADAM
Why are you calling the cops

Adam looks at his mom His eyes widen and focus in on the
mask

JOE

We know what you did this summer

ADAM
Oh well I’m sorry I’ve been
smoking weed Mom but you don’t
need to call the fucking cops on

ADAMS MOM
(crying)

ADAM

JOE

Adam we read your diary

ADAM

Adam lunges forward but Joseph gets up and puts Adam in a
head lock

JOE

Mom call them now
Adams mom picks up the phone and dials

ADAMS MOM
Hello My name is Jane My son is

looking for Yes I will hold

Adam kicks backwards and nails Joe right in the balls
Joe collapses and falls to the floor releasing Adam

Adam pulls out his knife

ADAM
Drop the fucking phone Mom

Adam grabs the phone and hangs it up He then walks out
of the room and returns with a duffle bag and places it
at his feet

ADAMS MOM
Adam the cops are coming You

will hunt you down Please Adam

JOE

Joe starts to stand up Adam looks down at the duffle

bag and unzips it and grabs a baseball bat from inside

ADAM
Have you ever played Marco Polo
with a baseball bat

JOE

Joe moves closer

ADAM

Joe wait
Joe stops for a second then starts walking again

ADAM (CONTD)

JOE

ADAM

ADAM

JOE

Joe walks close to Adam

ADAM
Ok

Adam swings the bat and connects with Joe’s head Joe
clutches his head and then falls to the floor Adam
points the baseball bat into the air triumphantly as if
he just hit a home run He then squats down over Joe and

looks up

ADAM (CONT’D)
Dad did you see that A home run

He never fucking said Polo

ADAMS MOM
Adam what did you just do

ADAM
I hit a home run but don’t
worry that ain’t the ball game

Adam starts slapping Joe in the face to try and wake him

up

ADAM (CONTD)
Damn he is out cold Wait

There we go he’s coming to

Joe starts to wake up Adam helps him stand up and then
drops to his knees and cuts both of Joes Achilles

tendons Joe screams and falls back to the floor
ADAMS MOM
Oh my GOD

When Joe hits the floor he is knocked out again Adam
watches this and then turns slowly and looks at his
mother

ADAM

You would really turn me in Mom

Adam stands up and starts moving closer to his mom She
slowly backs up

ADAMS MOM
I love you Adam but you need
help

ADAM

You wanted me to rot in prison

Adam drops the bat and grabs his mom’s head in both
hands

ADAMS MOM
Adam no

ADAM
Its okay mom I forgive you for

wanting me to rot in prison
Adam kisses is mom on the forehead

ADAM (CONT’D)
Because I am gonna make you rot in
hell

Adam slams his moms head into the wall She falls to the
ground He then gets on top of her and starts slamming
her head into the floor

ADAM (CONTD)
(very calmly)
I only was going to kill people
who reminded me of you mom Not

the real you

Joe takes hold of the baseball bat and starts to crawl

towards Adam

JOE
Adam Stop
ADAM
(shakes his head)

Uh unh

Adam slams her head into the floor harder and harder
until finally it busts open and brains spill out onto the

floor

JOE

God no Adam
Adam turns and his eyes go directly to the baseball bat

ADAM
You can’t even stand up dude let
alone lift that

Joe tries to lift the baseball bat but Adam kicks it out

of his hands

ADAM (CONTD)

I want you to eat her brains

JOE
What the fuck Why

ADAM
I said I want you to eat your
mothers fucking brains like the
little mindless fucking zombie you

Adam stabs Joe in the eye and twists the knife Joe dies

instantly

ADAM (CONTD)

I spit on your grave
Adam spits on Joe He then stands up and grabs the
journal and walks out of the room
INT LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A Fire is burning in the fire place Adam stands in

front of the fire and takes a few deep breaths He looks

at the journal one last time

ADAM
My Pure Joy

Everything goes quiet and all you can hear is CELLO MUSIC

which continues through the next scene

Adam throws the diary into the fireplace and it burns up

He stands there watching it burn He begins to cry
INT ADAMS ROOM

Adam is standing in his room and looks at both bodies on
the floor

He pulls the knife from Joe’s eye After a little bit of
a struggle it comes out along with an eyeball He then
takes the eyeball off of the knife and drops it on the

floor Adam then puts the mask on Joes face

Adam then sits on the ground and lays his mom across his

lap and holds her close

You can see the Red and blue flashing lights of the cop

car out of the window

A YOUNG COP busts open the bedroom door with his gun
drawn He looks around and looks at Adam cradling his
mother He feels the pulse of Joe He then stands up and
talks into his shoulder radio (MUSIC CONTINUES OVER)

The blue and red lights begin to fill the screen until
they totally block them out

eye Do you feel bad about it

ADAM
No dude He was a fucking psycho
I guess rehab really fucked him
up He killed so many people He

was wanted for 13 different cases

STEVE
Epic man Epic You should make a

movie about him

ADAM

I dunno

CHRIS

What are you gonna do now bro
ADAM
Well my dad paid for the house
outright before he died so I
guess I am just going to live

there alone

CHRIS
That’s some fuckin’ Amityville
Horror ass shit right there dude

Living in the ghost house

Steve
Nah dude that’s way more like
“The Shining”

ADAM
All I know is I need to take my
mind off of all this shit man
All this family stuff is
ridiculous I just need to relax
watch a movie Something I can

zone out to

Chris

What did you have in mind bro

ADAM
I dunno do you wanna watch “A
Serbian Film” or “Irreversible”
Those would be good for my

meditation time

STEVE
Oh fuck yeah those movies are

gnarly

ADAM
I think so People’s faces being
smashed in with fire extinguishers

always makes me happy
CHRIS
I’m down but have you seen “Tokyo

Gore Police”

ADAM
Yeah but more importantly are you

chiefing me out or what

CHRIS
What was it like stabbing him in
the eye

ADAM
It was like I dunno how to

explain it The best way is to say
the feeling that fills you when
you feel this crunch of bone as
the knife tears through flesh and
you know the person’s dead because
you watched that last glimmer of
life leave their eyes and you get
butterflies in your stomach That
feeling is like every movie kill
scene you have ever watched
combined That feeling is a crazy

calm of ecstacy where everything

leaves and the only thing left is
pure joy my pure joy

CHRIS
Woah dude I gotta fuckin’ kill

someone sometime

STEVE

That shit was intense
ADAM
Haha Will you chief me out
already bro I wanna watch a

movie
FADE OUT

THE END
