(the car starts to pull away despite the rope Only it is
dragging the church behind it)

Navin Um they might not be here uh exactly uh when you get
back but uh its a blue Chevy two door and it will be going
south on Hertatto street No I cant make out the license number

somebody now Millions of people look at this book every day
This is the kind of spontaneous publicity youre name in print
that makes people Im impressed Things are going to start
happening to me now

At Madmans house

Madman (he picks a name at random from the new phone book)
Johnson Navin R Sounds like a typical bastard

Back at the gas station

Madman Die Navin R Johnson Bastard random son of a bitch
typical run of the mill bastard

Navin Fill ‘er up
Stan Fill er up son and a little bit extra Stan Fox buying gas
Navin Navin R Johnson selling it sir

Madman Got ya you lavish typical blocking of the view of a God
damn average victim bastard

Navin Check your oil

Stan Check away Navin R Johnson

Navin Oil rag at the ready sir

Stan Lets check the oil together

Navin Yes sir thank you sir

Madman Son of blocking bastard

Stan Looks good to me sir but Id like your opinion (Stans
glasses slip off his nose) Damn these glasses Looks good to me
too Hurry up son times a wasting Im going to the john Dont
forget to check the tires Damn these glasses son

Navin Yes sir I damn thee

Stan Damn Damn these glasses

Navin Sir I can fix those glasses

Stan You can Well here fix those suckers

(Dramatic music plays as Navin is tossed the pair of glasses He
catches them and runs inside to fix them)
Madman Shit

(Stan comes back from the john)

Navin Sir Guess what - I fixed em I was back there thinking
what causes glasses to slip on and off and its because when you
take them on and off youre always putting pressure on the frames
like this - it causes them to spread so I put a little handle
right here in the centre and it puts the pressure on the bridge
where it belongs just like the tierods on a 72 Buick plus I put
a little nose brake on to prevent slippage Try it Use the
handle

Stan Well Ill be It works You know I make a pretty good
living selling shit like this I tell you what if I can develop
this gizmo Ill split with you fifty fifty

Navin Ok

Stan How much do I owe you for the gas I got a trunk load of
shit to sell

Navin Twenty six forty one

Stan Heres a triple six Keep the change

Navin Wow thanks

Madman Dead centre - say youre prayers half breed

Navin Hey Harry look at this Whats the matter with these cans

Navin These cans are defective - theyre springing leaks Come
over here and look at this

Harry Listen you better run for cover or youre going to spring
a leak

Navin Huh

holes in you

behind)

But tonight you belong to me

Just to little ol me

(Marie brings out a coronet she plays a solo then the song
ends)

both glad we had a religious wedding Money hasnt changed our
lives that much our one little extravagance is a live-in butler
and housekeeper

Navin Another check

Hobart Ah ha Just as I thought look at that Nearly three
quarters of a million dollars Sir one would think that with
that kind of income you could buy a larger house with proper
servants quarters

At Navins new house

Navin (reading) Well mom remember my dream of owning a big house
on a hill and how I used to wish for a living room with a plaster
lion in it from Mexico and how I always wanted a large twenty
four seat dining table in a dining room with original oil
paintings by Michelangelo and Rembrandt and remember how I always
wanted a rotating bed with pink chiffon and zebra stripes and
remember how I used to chit chat with dad about always wanting a
bathtub shaped like a clam and an office with orange and white
stripes and remember how much I wanted an all red billiard room
with a giant stuffed camel and how I wanted a disco room with my
own disco dancers and a party room with fancy friends and
remember how much I wanted a big backyard with Grecian statues
s-shaped hedges and three swimming pools Well I got that too
Marie and I are getting along swell but Ive got a lot to learn
about handling my money and banks You have to be careful Poor
Hobart Hester took some money out of her savings account and
had to pay a substantial penalty for early withdrawal (Hester is
shown outside being shot at by a firing squad) Enclosed is this
weeks check Love Navin

Navin Sorry about your wife Hobart

Hobart Federal regulations sir Oh dear me Your wife has given
you another gold chain I nearly forgot Ah I suppose Im still
not quite over Hesters death

Navin Well these things take time

Hobart Yes so Im told Oh and heres your drink sir like the
one you saw in the magazine

Navin Well you got the bamboo umbrella and everything See that
(he pulls the magazine out of the drawer) Be somebody

Hobart Very good sir very good Oh theres some charity people
here to see you sir

Navin Mo sent them away Theres a lot of people more deserving
than me

Hobart Ah but these people want you to give

Navin Oh ok
(a charity man walks in)

Father My name is Father Carlos Las Vegas De Cordova

Navin Father you seem like a religious man How can I help you
Father By giving me three minutes of your time so that you can
see some film of a great ugliness that is spreading throughout my
country

Navin Oh God I bet its disgusting Hobart

Hobart Yes sir

Navin Are you over your grief enough yet to dim the lights
Hobart Oh ha ha of course sir One cannot mourn forever
Father You will not believe what you are about to see that human
beings could have sunk so low that they can take pleasure to do
this to another of Gods creatures I hope you have a strong
stomach senor

Navin Roll the ugliness

(A scene in a Mexican bar - cat juggling Navin is shocked The
juggler looks suspiciously like Navin but rest assured
according to the movies credits Steve Martin plays Navin and
Pig Eye Jackson is credited as the cat juggler)

Navin Good Lord - Ive heard about this - cat juggling Stop
Stop Stop it Stop it Stop it Good Father could there be a
god that would let this happen How much do you want

Outside the house

Boss If your initial investment is a half a million dollars and
your apartments are up in March you should have x amount of
dollars rolling in by the end of this year

Navin Ah x amount Thats very good isnt it

Con Man Not only that you can depreciate the entire building for
the full amount

Navin Depreciate Hum very good I like that
Con Man And we found a way to get around this fair housing crap
Navin Ah good Getting around the crap Thats good

Con Man 2 By keeping the rents high were going to appeal to a
select class of people

Navin Select class Very very good
Boss Well keep the eggplants out

Navin Ah good We dont want any vegetables
Con Man Na na The jungle bunnies

Navin Oh of course Theyll eat the vegetables

Con Man Boss could I talk to him Were going to keep out the
niggers

Navin The what

Boss The niggers Well keep em out
Navin Sir you are talking to a nigger

(Navin practices his karate on them all of course hes a
blackbelt The last man standing presents a bit of a problem
though Navin hurts his foot)

In a fancy restaurant

Marie Dont be so hard on yourself How could you know that was
Iron Balls McGinty

Waiter Would monsieur care for another bottle of Chateau Latour

Navin Ah yes but no more 1966 Lets splurge Bring us some fresh
wine The freshest youve got - this year No more of this old
stuff

that way ok Waiter there are snails on her plate Now get
them out of here before she sees them Look away just look away

food There are so many snails there you cant even see the food

appetizers you talked me out of

Waiter Oui monsieur

Navin Can you believe this First they didnt have the bamboo
umbrellas for the wine and now snails on the food Two boobs

people a lifetime to acquire Come on lets toast

In Navins disco room

(lots of people dancing disco music)

Partier Everybody Navins on tv Marie its Navin

Marie Oh honey heres that interview you did on tv Shut off
the music Shut it off Shut off the music Everyone were going
to watch Navin on the tv Now sit down sit down on the floor
Turn around

Announcer American Time News Magazine turns its probing eye on
Navin Johnson inventor of the Opti-grab That little glasses
handle that sold ten million units in a few short months Mr
Johnson youve become a millionaire overnight Who are you

Navin Who is Navin Johnson Navin is a complex personality as
are most of the small breed of modern day renaissance
millionaires

Announcer We had planned to show you the entire Johnson
interview however when we returned to our studio our news
department informed us of a sensational development in the
Johnson story It seems that an irate group of citizens led by
the celebrity Mr Carl Reiner has filed a class action suit
against Mr Johnson and his Opti-Grab Heres what Mr Reiner had
to say at a press conference

Carl Reiner When Opti-grab came out I thought it was the
greatest thing ever and I bought a pair And this is the result
(Mr Reiner removes his pair of dark glasses to reveal) This
little handle is like a magnet your eyes are constantly drawn to
it and you end up cock-eyed Now as a director I am constantly
using my eyes and this Opti-grab device has caused irreparable
harm to my career Let me show you a clip from my latest film
where my faulty depth perception kept me from yelling cut at the
proper time (scene of a little red sportscar speeding off a
cliff Reiner yells Cut just after the car goes over the edge)
If I had yelled cut on time those actors would be alive today
Thats why I am spearheading the ten million dollar class action
suit against Mr Johnson and his irresponsible selling of a
product he didnt even test on prisoners Thank you

Partier Looks like the parties over

Navin Hey wait a minute where are you going

Partier Im going to get in touch with that Reiner guy

(everyone leaves the party)

Navin Ive got some change upstairs Well get some potato chips
well make it a less formal thing Honey why the gloom Its not
the end of the rainbow Im Navin Johnson inventor This is no
big deal - this is a parking ticket to me only instead of five

dollars its ten million

Marie I dont care about losing all the money its losing all
the stuff

Navin Were not going to lose the stuff this is America Were
going to receive a fair trial from an impartial jury

Inside a court house
(the judge and jury are all cock-eyed)
Jury Foreman Your honor we the jury find for the plaintiff

Judge I award to Mr Reiner and the other 9987652 plaintiffs
the full amount of the suit Court is adjourned

magazine but not his dog Eventually Navin spots a woman
carrying a red and white thermos He trades everything he has for
the thermos)

Beside a theater (from the opening of the movie)

Navin (his voice only) I was so glad to be going home I remember
those days when I sang and danced with my family on the porch of
the old house But things change and with all the additions to
the family we had to tear down the old house even though we
loved it But we built us a bigger one

(everyone is singing and dancing on the porch)

Gonna jump down turn around pick a bail of cotton

Gonna jump down turn around pick a bail of hay
