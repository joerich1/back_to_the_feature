needle

FANNY BRAWNE aged 18 is SEWING by FIRST LIGHT while her 9-

stitches

friend Mr Keats

FANNY
No I have not forgot Can you help Margaret
the stitches must be small and exactly even

Mrs Brawne takes over from her youngest daughter

FANNY (cont’d)
What if Mr Brown has already poisoned Mr Keats
against me I shall not be afraid to take
them on in wit If I am in the mood I could
lash them both

MRS BRAWNE
Why not ignore Mr Brown

FANNY
He provokes me Mama it is his game I must
defend myself

upstairs over her arms like a baby

out onto Hampstead Heath past the WASHER WOMEN and a maze of
WASHING LINES

EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH FIELD - DAY 7

Fanny and her family walk down the Heath between CLOTHES
spread out on BUSHES with a distant London beyond They pass
a FAMILY evicted from their house with their possessions
BED WARDROBE and TABLE for sale The air is SMOKE FILLED
from the burning of AUTUMN LEAVES

EXTINT WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 8

The Brawne family group turn into the gate of WENTWORTH
HOUSE Fanny dauntless her head high her cheeks pink and
ready for battle

MARIA DILKE greets them at the door adoring Fanny’s new
dress and it’s petal embroidery Fanny greets everyone
warmly MR DILKE and little CHARLES their son MR BROWN
joins the group Fanny frowns and looks away

MR BROWN
Ah the very well stitched little Miss Brawne
in all her detail

MRS BRAWNE (TO MARIA DILKE)
Where is Mr Keats

MARIA DILKE
I’m afraid he is not joining us He is next
door in Mr Brown’s half of the house

Mr Brown puts out his hand to Fanny who moves past ignoring
him

MR BROWN
What is this What have I done How have I
offended

FANNY

I don’t shake hands with an enemy

MR BROWN
An enemy What have I done to you
BLUE PAGES 040408 3

FANNY
You do nothing to me or for me and that is
how I prefer to keep it

Mr Brown holds up his arms in mock wonder enjoying teasing
Fanny as he might a lap dog

MR BROWN
What

FANNY
All right your offence is to my fashion to
which I am “so helpless slavish”

MR BROWN
I didn’t say that Mrs Dilke I never would
say such nonsense I have been ill quoted

The gathering moves into the DRAWING ROOM where tea is
served Maria is bowing her head guiltily

MR DILKE (TO MR BROWN)
Baitingbaiting

FANNY
”“her obsession with flounce and cross
stitch”

MR BROWN

Cross stitch Miss Brawne I don’t even know
what it means I have been wrongly used

FANNY
I feel the same about your poems Mr Brown I
know nothing of what they mean In fact they
have the quality of your cigar they puff
smoke and dissolve leaving nothing but
irritation

MRS BRAWNE
Fanny why not talk to one of us you hold in
higher favour

FANNY
Mr Brown sets out to irritate and he is
successful now I set out to demolish and I am
only begun

MR BROWN
Ohhh

MARIA DILKE
Fanny take this tea to poor Mr Keats he is in
very poor spirits

FANNY (LOOKING CONCERNED )
Oh Will he have sugar
BLUE PAGES 040408 4

MR BROWN
He is composing and does not want disturbing

FANNY
It is my finding in the business of disturbing
you are the expert

MRS BRAWNE
Fanny that is too far

FANNY
I am praising him

MRS BRAWNE
Fanny

FANNY

What now I am restrained because I compliment
him too much I withdraw Let someone else
take Mr Keats’s tea I want to be left alone
to examine the length of my stitches

MARIA DILKE (POURING KEATS’S TEA)
Please Fanny I want you to go I am wanting to
know what you shall say about Mr Keats I
have been waiting two weeks that I may enjoy
your opinion I cannot look upon him without
smiling and he is quick with his thoughts
though now they are mostly sad

MR DILKE
His brother Tom is not at all better very
diminished

Fanny’s sympathy is engaged

MARIA DILKE
Mr Keats nurses him alone It is difficult
work

MRS BRAWNE
Are there no other family members

MARIA DILKE
No The parents are both dead There is only
a much younger sister and a brother who
emigrated to America

MRS BRAWNE
How old is Tom

MR DILKE
Only 19 very painful and Keats is not much
older

MRS BRAWNE

I am so sorry

INT MR BROWN’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 9

Fanny stops mid corridor to check her hair and self in the
hall glass

She is possessed neither pleased or displeased with her
appearance and dispassionate in her attention

Outside Mr Brown’s DOOR Fanny stops to knock and then to turn
the handle but KEATS surprises her by pulling the door
suddenly open (expecting Mr Brown)

Keats and Fanny are eye to eye each other’s petite equal
They laugh The tea sloshes

FANNY
You like jokes Mr Keats I like jokes I hope
we shall play some on each other Mr Brown I
warn you does not like my jokes he complains
I care for nothing but fashion Should you
like cake

Fanny turns to leave

KEATS
And what shall be said of me You have come
to spy
FANNY
I came to bring you tea
KEATS
How will you describe me My character
FANNY
I am not the least interested in your
character
KEATS
My jacket then or my pantaloon
FANNY
You need a new jacket that is what I would
say
KEATS
That is all
FANNY

That it should be of velvet

KEATS
Tell me Miss Brawne how are you so sure
BLUE PAGES 040408 5A

FANNY
All that I wear I have designed and sewn
myself Is it not well done

(MORE)

BLUE PAGES 040408 6

FANNY (contd)
I am often told I am clever to exception about
design I have originated the pleated edge
upon the ribbon It is charming and it has
been copied

Mr Brown enters the room and sits at his spot at the WRITING
DESK opposite Keats pushing his chair back to look at Fanny

MR BROWN
Has she annoyed you sufficiently She has
done brilliant well with me Mens room
mens room OUT thank you Poets writing

Mr Brown picks up his PEN and acts writing Fanny leaves
calmly as if Mr Brown was not scuttling her

KEATS
Goodbye minxstress

FANNY
My stitching has more merit and admirers than
your two scribbling’s put together

KEATS AND MR BROWN
Ohhhh Ohhhh

FANNY
And I can make money from it

KEATS
Ouch

EXT STREET HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 10

Margaret and Samuel make their way to the BOOKSHOP careful

INT BOOKSHOP - DAY 11

The BELL on the BOOKSHOP DOOR rings Margaret and Samuel
enter Their boots clunk on the boards of the quiet shop
they walk to the counter There is no-one there they stand
in front of it A VOICE speaks from a shelf behind

SHOPKEEPER
Yes

Samuel moves to the counter

SAMUEL
Have you got John Keats’s poem book Endy

SHOPKEEPER
Endymion I’ve not heard much good about it
I’ve not sold one and took twenty

BLUE PAGES 040408 7

The SHOPKEEPER takes a copy from a tallish pile

MARGARET
My sister has met the author She wants to
read it for herself and decide if he is an
idiot or not

INT BEDROOM ELM COTTAGE - DAY 12

Fanny at home in her room sews the tiny pleats of a TRIPLE
MUSHROOM PLEATED COLLAR Her needle weaving in and out then
drawing the thread through Her eyelashes caught in the PALE
WHITE SUN Standing in her PETTICOAT she holds the almost
complete collar to her neck and checks it’s effect in the
glass She gently tilts her head to the side and points her
toe

INT BEDROOM ELM COTTAGE - DAY 13

Margaret and Samuel come upstairs and enter Fanny’s bedroom
Margaret takes off her COAT and sits Fannys steel needle
pauses

FANNY
Unwrap it

Margaret takes the BROWN PAPER from the book Fanny watches
She takes the book in her own hands turns it over opens it
to the title page Then passes it back to Margaret

FANNY (cont’d)
Read it

Her needle weaves in and out of the pleats drawing it’s pale
thread behind it

MARGARET
ENDYMION
BOOK 1
“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever
Its loveliness increases it will never
Pass into nothingness but still will keep
A bower quiet for us and a sleep
Full of sweet dreams and health and quiet
breathing
Therefore on every morrow are we wreathing
A flowery band to bind us to the earth”

Fanny’s eyes stop and go deeply inside she is listening
Her needle again weaves in and out of the fine pleat She is
sewing faster

MARGARET (contd)
“Spite of despondence of the inhuman dearth”
BLUE PAGES 040408 8

FANNY
Stop

Margaret stops and looks to Fanny Fanny stops sewing

FANNY (cont’d)
I am completely lost

Fanny takes the book from Margaret

FANNY (cont’d)
“yes in spite of all
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall
From our dark spirits”

14 INT THE ROYAL ARTILLERY MESS - EVENING 14

The ROYAL ARTILLERY MESS at WOOLWICH a DANCE and Fanny in
the centre of it in her new gown She dances with a studied
grace The effect is elegant yet mannered

In the interval she sights an under dressed Keats sitting
back ignoring the dancers absorbed in his thoughts Near
him Mr Brown and their friend REYNOLDS and his SISTERS talk
loudly Fanny whispers to her younger brother Samuel
Samuel slouches over to Keats

SAMUEL
My sister Miss Brawne wishes to greet you Mr
Keats

KEATS

And where is she

Fanny is all alone waiting for him strategically posed by a
large ORNATE MIRROR near the dining hall

FANNY
“A thing of beauty is a joy for ever
Its loveliness increases it will never
Pass into nothingness”

Keats looks surprised

KEATS
You have read Endymion

FANNY
I wanted to adore it

KEATS
But you hate it

FANNY
I cannot say
BLUE PAGES 040408 9

KEATS

Are you afraid to speak truthfully
FANNY

Never
KEATS

Well tell me then

FANNY
No I am not at all clever with poetry

KEATS
Neither it seems am I Still I have hope for
myself What do you make of my hope Miss

Brawne
FANNY
I think hope very useful
KEATS
But
FANNY

But hope and results are very different One
does not create the other

KEATS
Could practice help

FANNY
Yes it might I was not always able to stitch
so well

KEATS

Ah ha I must practice my stitches
Fanny looks at Keats

FANNY
Let me do the sewing I have such a start
This is the first frock in Woolwich or
Hampstead to have a triple-pleated-mushroom
collar

Keats looks about to realise there is only Fanny himself and
their reflection

KEATS (INTIMATELY )
Behind you I see one I fear to be identical

Fanny disconcerted turns to see her own reflection she
laughs very pleased with the joke

She sees a GROUP of MILITARY MEN dance partners searching
for her She puts her back to them so she may finish
talking

BLUE PAGES 040408 10

FANNY
My card is completely full three I have met
before and are suitors Mr Tarrant is scaring
me with his talk of estates and his dogs he
has eleven Maman says it is possible to love
almost anybody and I will come to understand
that

KEATS (GESTURES )
Even Mr---

FANNY
Tarrant Yes isn’t that a miracle But you
don’t dance Mr Keats I love to dance

KEATS

I don’t feel like dancing
FANNY

Your brother is still ill
KEATS

He is no better
FANNY

I have thought of him often and wish to make
him something Would lemon wafers be

agreeable

KEATS
He would like so much that you had thought of
him

FANNY

My Papa was ill for as long as I can remember
He died when I was still a child

Fanny tears up She takes out a small WHITE EMBROIDERED
HANDKERCHIEF and pats her eyes

The TWO MILITARY MEN spot Fanny and come over

Keats bows and departs while Fanny is led out on to the dance
floor She has recovered herself and is dancing with
quaintly exaggerated hand movements aimed at affecting a
personal stylishness The Reynolds sisters notice and
comically impersonate Apparently for Keats’s benefit He
is not amused by them or by Fanny but is alone and alienated

INT KITCHEN ELM COTTAGE - DAY 15

On the kitchen table Fanny and the maid are grating LEMON
RIND Dabbing WAFER MIX onto an OVEN TRAY Stoking the
FIRE From the cooked wafers Fanny tosses all but the most
perfect onto a rubbish heap She lines a BASKET with LINEN
Then pausing she turns from the table

BLUE PAGES 040408 11

Quickly she swoops on Margaret’s frock where she snips a
LEMON RIBBON off her neckline and begins to tie it
decoratively on the basket

MARGARET
Mother Fanny has taken my ribbon and she
never asked Mama

Margaret goes in search of her mother who she finds in the
hall way

MARGARET (contd)
She has cut my ribbon

Mrs Brawne enters the kitchen to see a mess of SHATTERED and
DISCARDED wafers and Fanny tying the ribbon on her basket of
20 PERFECT wafers

MRS BRAWNE
What are you doing Fanny
FANNY
I am trying to bring some comfort to a dying

man

Mrs Brawne picks up one of the discarded wafers from a huge
stack

MRS BRAWNE
What dying man Where are you taking them

FANNY
I cannot offer poor Mr Keats’s brother
anything that is not perfect

MRS BRAWNE
But so many of them look quite well

FANNY
Mama quite well He may die I cannot offer
him anything but our most beautiful and our
best
EXT WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 16

MR BROWN
Leave it at the door
FANNY

KEATS

MR BROWN

FANNY
I have something for Mr Keats’s brother

Heavy footsteps Mr Brown opens the door Fanny holds out a
basket with a LACE NAPKIN laid over the top Mr Brown whips
off the LACE COVER and pinches a wafer

MR BROWN
Mmmmdelicious

FANNY
You vile disgusting ape

A sad Keats turns his head towards Fanny at the door and
watches listlessly

KEATS
Invite Miss Brawne inside Let them all come
in

Mr Brown stands aside gobbling his wafer

MR BROWN
Be careful you enter the apes cage (mimicking
a monkey) Hoo hoo hoo

FANNY
You are invisible to me you idiot you

KEATS
Come and sit here next to me Miss Brawne My
prospects in the world feel very faint

FANNY
This room is so poorly cared for It is half
night in here for want of pulling your drapes
back

She passes over the wafers
BLUE PAGES 040408 13

FANNY (cont’d)
Please try one I am anxious they will cause
him to choke

Keats takes one Mr Brown puts his hand into the basket
Fanny whips it away

FANNY (cont’d)
No They are baked for someone very ill Try
another and I swear I shall bite you

MR BROWN
Ohhh I’m very scared

KEATS
Take care she has sharp teeth She has sunk
her fangs into my poor poem and shook it
apart

FANNY
I am very sorry I could not love your Endymion
completely Mr Keats Perhaps I did not say
but I thought the beginning of your poem
something very perfect

Fanny turns to go

KEATS
No don’t leave us You can see for yourself
nothing is happening All day we lie about
the room begging for inspiration Tell me
what I must do

FANNY
There is something sordid and menacing that I
don’t at all enjoy in the atmosphere I am in
a hurry to get myself away I feel I am
inside a cage with two monkeys

KEATS
We monkeys just want a little company

Mr Brown steals another wafer Fanny spins away
FANNY
How dare you
EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 18
Fanny Margaret and Samuel walk back fast through the Heath

upwards Keats flush faced is jogging after them but
somewhat behind them He has Fanny’s basket in his hand
BLUE PAGES 040408 13A

KEATS
If weve finished tiffing come and say
“hello” to Tom it might cheer him
BLUE PAGES 040408 14

MARGARET
We will have to ask Mama

FANNY
No we don’t Toots

MARGARET
Yes we do isn’t that so Samuel We have to
stay together

Samuel shrugs Fanny walks off

FANNY
Well then I am going and you will have to
come with me

Keats stands at the junction of many tracks

KEATS
Should you like to go by the pond or through
the wood I have explored all these paths
which are more in number than your eyelashes

FANNY
My eyelashes

Fanny bats her eyelashes and laughs She walks beside Keats

FANNY (cont’d)
It amazes me that you can sit opposite Mr
Brown all day I have never heard him say one
thing of wit Not one

KEATS
You favour wit

FANNY
I rate it the highest

KEATS
You like the fashionables

FANNY
Yes I do

KEATS
Men who say things that make you start without
making you feel

FANNY
No things that are amusing

KEATS
I know these dandy’s they have a mannerism in
their very eating and drinking in their
handling of a decanter

BLUE PAGES 040408 15

FANNY
You are making an attack on me

KEATS
No I am defending Mr Browns generous good
heart

FANNY
By attacking myself

KEATS
Forgive me I have been too long at my
brother’s sick bed

FANNY
Can we not still appreciate clever humour

What witty thing can be said of a nineteen
year old drowning in his own blood

Fanny suddenly realises the seriousness of Tom’s illness

Nothing nothing at all

Shush or I’1l1 cut your hair in the night

Keats comes back out looking pale and saddened

KEATS
He is feverish and cannot speak
BLUE PAGES 040408 16

REYNOLDS SISTER 2
We did not know there were people left who had
not read it

REYNOLDS SISTER 1
You have not seen it

MARIA DILKE
In this house we do not acknowledge it

FANNY
Was it so very bad

MARIA DILKE
I can’t bring myself to remember
BLUE PAGES 040408 18

REYNOLDS SISTER 2
It has stuck in my mind “”no man whose
mind has ever been imbued with the smallest
knowledge or feeling of classical poetry or
classical history could have”

REYNOLDS SISTER 1 (JOINS IN)
“profaned and vulgarised every association
in the manner which has been adopted by this
“son of promise””

FANNY
Did they not admire the opening The opening
was perfect even I could know that

REYNOLDS SISTER 1
Do you like poetry Miss Brawne

FANNY
No Poems are a strain to work out - and I
never can tell if I have worked them well

The Reynolds sisters titter

JOHN REYNOLDS enters the room He is a lawyer poet friend of
Keats

REYNOLDS SISTER 1
John we are talking or about to talk of your
defence of Mr Keats’s poem Endymion

JOHN REYNOLDS
Yes
“I have clung to nothing loved a nothing
nothing seen or felt but a great dream OT
have been presumptuous against love against
the sky Against all elements against the tie
of mortals each to each”
The rhythm is beautiful and unique There are
rhymes but not on the beat they are quiet but
binding and the repetitions set you up to fly
“I have clung to nothing loved a nothing

nothing seen”

Reynolds indicates the expanse of flight

JOHN REYNOLDS (cont’d)
Here you come out
“Or felt but a great dream”

FANNY
It’s beautiful

JOHN REYNOLDS
There are immaturities but also immensities
and that is what they didn’t say

BLUE PAGES 040408 19

REYNOLDS SISTER 1
It was said you said it brother

JOHN REYNOLDS
Thank you

INT BRAWNE’S PARLOURHALLFRONT DOOR ELM COTTAGE - DAY 29

John Keats Charles Brown and the Brawnes sit in the
Brawne’s PARLOUR Fanny is silent Mr Brown talks to Mrs
Brawne who is all solicitude

MR BROWN
I woke with the strange sensation of someone
holding my hand I opened my eyes and there
was John I knew immediately what had
happened and then he said “Tom died at 8
o’clock quietly and without pain” Of course
Mr Keats can’t go on living there so I have
invited him to stay with me

Mr Brown stands sighing looking towards a numb Keats

MR BROWN (contd)
Aghuh we have a long schedule of visits

Fanny sits with her eyes downcast Keats is watching her
sensing her disappointment that they are leaving so soon

MRS BRAWNE
I don’t want to interfere with your city plans
but you are most welcome to have dinner with
us We have provided and set the table

KEATS (QUIETLY TO FANNY)
Minx Are you unwell I have never seen you
so quiet
BLUE PAGES 040408 20A

FANNY
I am sad for your brother Mr Keats
BLUE PAGES 040408 21

Fanny hands him the silk embroidered PILLOW SLIP wrapped in
BLACK CLOTH

MARGARET
She has been sewing it all through the night

Keats begins to unwrap it enough to see the beautiful
stitching and the simple pattern of wild flowers on the edge

KEATS
I am afraid I will break down Tell me what
it is

FANNY

It is a pillow slip

KEATS
Then I shall rest Tom’s head upon it

MR BROWN
Keats the Reynolds are expecting us

KEATS
I will catch you up Thank you

Keats kisses the pillow slip
Mr Brown has come across and is whispering in Keats ear

MR BROWN
Let us get out of here

It is a loud whisper loud enough so that Fanny and Keats
both hear Fanny shamed watches as the two men continue
discussing she catches phrases “would like to stay” “we
are expected by HAYDEN and LAMB”

Keats puts on his COAT

KEATS
Invite me again alone

FANNY
Come for Christmas

KEATS
Shouldn’t you ask your mother

FANNY
No what one of us wants we all wish for that
is how we are

But Marianne Reynolds invited us for
Christmas You were there when she said it

MR BROWN (contd)
I am sorry to spoil things

MRS BRAWNE
Not at all Wherever Mr Keats is happy we are
happy for him

MARGARET
Why can’t he be happy with us

FANNY
Because Mr Brown wants Mr Keats all to
himself

MR BROWN

Keats sits opposite and as he sits he begins to speak so
naturally they are only gradually aware he is reciting

KEATS
“When I have fears that I may cease to be
Before my pen has glean’d my teeming brain
Before high-piled books in charactery
Hold like rich garners the full ripen’d grain
When I behold upon the night’s starr’d face
Huge cloudy symbols of a high romance”

At the door everyone is saying goodbye and waving Fanny
walks out into the street with Keats

FANNY

Mr Keats have you remembered the poem

KEATS (HE NODS AND CLEARS HIS THROAT)

“eHuge cloudy symbols of a high romance

And

think that I may never live to trace

Their shadows with the magic hand of chance

And

when I feel fair creature of an hour

That I shall never look upon thee more
Never have relish in the faery power

Of an unreflecting love - then on the shore
Of the wide world I stand alone and think
Till love and fame to nothingness do sink”

Fanny and Keats look at each other Keats is bewitched so

INT BROWN’S DRAWING ROOM WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 39

Fanny and Keats sit together Fanny listening intently
Keats seems a little flat

KEATS
A poet is not at all poetical he is the most
un-poetical of anything in existence he has
no identity - he is continually filling some
other body the sun the moon

Mr Brown watches disturbed

MR BROWN
I cannot restrain my credibility longer Miss
Brawne may I ask you a question

FANNY
You may

MR BROWN
Is this really you Or are you acting

FANNY
It is really me

Keats is looking irritated

KEATS
Charles I have a pupil desist or depart

Mr Brown gets up takes some BOOKS and his TEA CUP with him

MR BROWN (UNDER HIS VOICE)
My modest hope is the cost of the lessons will
not be the poet

FANNY (STANDING)
The cost Mr Brown is that Mr Keats will
forthwith discuss poetry with me not you as I
shall study

MR BROWN
You don’t mean to read the poems

FANNY
I do until I know all the poets and poems in
the world I have an excellent brain and
nothing to do as you have so many times noted
BLUE PAGES 040408 27A

MR BROWN
Let me bow to your ambition

Mr Brown exits

FANNY
Now Mr Brown has gone I shall find it easier
to talk he is forever scrutinising

Fanny looks at Keats She is unsettled by his darkening
mood

FANNY (cont’d)
Can you say something of the craft of
poetry

Keats’s face darkens

KEATS
Poetic craft is a carcass a sham If poetry
does not come as naturally as leaves to a tree
it had better not come at all

Fanny is writing NOTES as Keats speaks

KEATS (cont’d)
I am mistaken I am not sure I can teach you

FANNY
Am I so extremely hopeless Is it Mr Brown I
was too rude I can apologise

KEATS
I don’t think I have the right feeling towards
women I’m suspicious of my feelings

FANNY
I don’t understand you

KEATS
If you knew what a slave to my affections I
fear myself to be and the fury it brings
about in me you might understand

FANNY
Do you not like me

KEATS
I am attracted without knowing why all women
confuse me even my mother I yearn to be
ruined by shrews and saved by angels and in
reality I have only ever loved my sister

Fanny begins to put on her BONNET

FANNY
I am annoyed by my sister as often as I love
her And I still do not know how to work a
poem out well
BLUE PAGES 040408

KEATS
You do not work out a poem That would undo
it’s magic Poems need understanding through
the senses they develop your negative
capability not rational capability

FANNY
And what is negative capability

KEATS
Your capacity for being in uncertainties
mysteries doubts without any irritable
reaching after fact and reason

Fanny listens not understanding

KEATS (cont’d)
The point of diving in a lake isn’t
immediately to swim to the shore but to be in
the lake to luxuriate in the sensation of
water You do not work the lake out it is an
experience beyond thought Poetry soothes and
emboldens the soul to accept mystery

FANNY
I love mystery

KEATS
I found your little princess on the wall by
my bed

FANNY
You could make her out

heart THE EVE OF ST AGNES
“Out went the taper as she hurried in
Its little smoke in pallid moonshine died
She closed the door she panted all akin
To spirits of the air and visions wide
No utter’d syllable or woe betide
But to her heart her heart was voluble
Paining with eloquence her balmy side
As though a tongueless nightingale should
swell
Her throat in vain and die heart-stifled in
her dell”

Mr Brown listens impressed a little smitten and also
dubious of her claims

MR BROWN
And what Miss Brawne did you make of Paradise
Lost

LEAD PENCIL He does not write but becomes perfectly still
his body relaxed his focus inward

KEATS (VO)
ODE to a NIGHTINGALE
“My heart aches and a drowsy numbness pains
My sense as though of hemlock TI had drunk
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
One minute past and Lethe-wards had sunk
‘Tis not through envy of their happy lot
But being too happy in thy happiness -”

Fanny watches Keats move his chair to the shade and his pen
make its steady journey across the paper

Mr Brown enters his living room he notices the chair gone
then Keats under the tree one leg crossed over the other
completely still except for the pen flying

BLUE PAGES 040408 46

KEATS (VO) (cont’d)
“That thou light-winged Dryad of the trees
In some melodious plot
Of beechen green and shadows numberless
Singest of summer in full-throated ease”

Called him soft names in many a mused rhyme
To take into the air my quiet breath”

While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
In such an ecstasy”

My dearest Lady

“I am now at a very pleasant Cottage window looking onto a
beautifully hilly country with a glimpse of the sea the
morning is very fine I do not know how elastic my spirit
might be what pleasure I might have in living here if the
remembrance of you did not weigh so upon me --- ask yourself
my love whether you are not very cruel to have so
entrammelled me so destroyed my freedom”

EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 78

Fanny leaves the house trailed by Margaret and Samuel As
she walks out upon the Heath away from other strangers and
far ahead of her brother and sister she takes out Keats’s
LETTER

Keats’s letter continued

“Will you confess this in a letter You must write
immediately and do all you can to console me in it --- make
it rich as a drought of poppies to intoxicate me --- write
the softest words and kiss them that I may at least touch my
lips where yours have been”

Fanny gulps for breath she kneels unaware of herself in the
LONG GRASS studying the words Pressing her lips against the
letter

Keats’s letter continued

“For myself I know not how to express my devotion to so fair
a form I want a brighter word than bright a fairer word
than fair”

Margaret and Samuel catch up with Fanny and collapse in the
grass near her watching her strange possession with the
letter but knowing better than to interrupt

Keats’s letter continued
“I almost wish we were butterflies and liv’d but three summer
days --- three such days with you I could fill with more

delight than fifty common years could ever contain”

Fanny beams at Margaret She pulls her towards her and
kisses her

“I have two luxuries to brood over in my walks your
loveliness and the hour of my death O that I could have
possession of them both in the same minute

I am miserable that you are not with me or rather breathe
in the dull sort of patience that cannot be called life I
never knew before what such a love as you have made me feel
was I did not believe in it my Fancy was afraid of it lest
it should burn me up But if you will fully love me though
there may be some fire it will not be more than we can bear
when moistened and bedewed with Pleasures”

on the table Abigail crosses past with a barely touched
TRAY of BROTH and TOAST from Keats’s room DR BREE is
finishing up a plate of bacon and eggs The Brawnes
(including Samuel and Margaret) are sitting at the table
listening anxiously

MR BROWN
Doctor Bree was particular in saying that Mr
Keats should avoid all sources of excitement
It is a disease peculiarly vulnerable to
romantic anxiety

Brown looks towards the Doctor who confirms Brown’s
explanation with a nod

DR BREE
A lot of rest

He leaves head down signalling them to remain

MR BROWN
Keats has already asked to see Miss Brawne but
I have managed him and said she had gone into
town

FANNY
But I have not How could I go into town when
Mr Keats is so ill

MR BROWN
I am speaking of keeping Mr Keats calm

FANNY
What must he be thinking This is a deception
I cannot join

MR BROWN
It is not a deception I am simply determined
to preserve the life of my friend

FANNY
He will be unquiet until he sees me

MR BROWN
He has been profoundly unquiet since you have
decided to love him Miss Brawne

FANNY
He would be more unquiet if I decided not to

FANNY
Mr Brown would have it that I kill Mr Keats
with affection
BLUE PAGES 040408 66

MR BROWN
Perhaps you will Perhaps there is nothing I
can do to protect him from your insistence of
loving him into an early grave But I shall
try Miss Brawne I shall try All visits

KEATS (VO)
“My sweet creature when I look back upon the
ecstasies in which I have pass’d some days and
the miseries in their turn I wonder the more
at the Beauty which has kept up the spell so
fervently When I send this round I shall be
in the front parlour watching to see you show
yourself for a minute in the garden
How horrid was the chance of slipping into the
ground instead of into your arms - the
difference is amazing Love
Do not take the trouble of writing much
merely send me my “good night” to put under
my pillow”

J Keats

FANNY
Why do you say impossibilities

KEATS
I have coughed blood again I fear the
disease has the upper hand and I cannot
recover

FANNY
I cannot leave you It is an impossibility I
have such clear hope about your new book of
poems When you are well enough you can
finish the fair copying They are more
beautiful than any I have read of Mr Coleridge
or Mr Wordsworth or even Lord Byron

FANNY (cont’d)
“Oh What can ail thee knight at arms
Alone and palely loitering
The sedge has withered from the lake
And no birds sing”

FANNY (cont’d)
“I met a lady in the Meads
Full beautiful a faery’s child
Her hair was long her foot was light
And her eyes were wild -”

KEATS
“I set her on my pacing steed
And nothing else saw all day long
For sidelong would she bend and sing
A faery’s song -”

FANNY
“She found me roots of relish sweet
And honey wild and manna dew
And sure in language strange she said
I love thee true -”
BLUE PAGES 040408 71

KEATS
“She took me to her elfin grot
And there she wept and sigh’d full sore
And there I shut her wild wild eyes
With kisses four”

And there I dream’d - Ah Woe betide
The latest dream I ever dreamt
On the cold hill side”

Keats who constantly watches her

MR HUNT
Gentleman I think we should hear Dr Bree on
the issue of climate for Keats health
Does he want to go to Rome

DR BREE
He has to go He won’t live through another
winter in England

MR HUNT
How do you feel about Italy John

Keats doesn’t reply

MR BROWN
I think it’s an issue of finance

MR HUNT
Could we between us not start a fund or a
collection Where are we up to with the poems

MR HASLAM
We have them in the Galley now

JOHN REYNOLDS
Could they not generate income

MR HASLAM
It is very hard to predict sales

BLUE PAGES 040408

MR HUNT
Of course he’1ll need a traveling companion
Brown you’ll go

MR BROWN
Yes absolutely someone must go but I’m not
sure I’1l be able to

MR HUNT
Is that a ‘No’

a Dr Clark who could also find rooms for you
Mr Keats

you want

At that moment a pregnant Abigail makes her way into the room
with a tray of hot tea

ABIGAIL (HISSING)
Miss Miss

But it is Mr Brown who strides irritated to the door and
swiftly takes the hot pot Abigail doesn’t move she stays
still like a stunned rabbit The men look then look away

KEATS
Wait

Fanny nods confused

KEATS (cont’d)
Yes you can wait you can probably find
amusements I am not the same as you The
very air I breathe empty of you is unhealthy
You are to me an object intensely desirable
But that’s all right because you can wait
You don’t know what it is to love It is
making me glad there is such a thing as the
grave

Abigail now Mrs Brown is taking tea in the dining room and
happily showing off her baby boy to Mrs Brawne and Margaret

In the connecting sitting room Mr Brown stands at the window
shuffling through his LETTERS from Keats making an effort to
engage with Fanny who is clearly resistant Fanny is sewing
a length of BLACK RIBBON onto the black material one neat
small black stitch after another

MR BROWN
You saw the baby Looks like AbigailJohn’s
reached Naples They quarantined his ship
He wrote that he made more puns in two weeks
out of desperation than he had in any other
year of his life I should have liked to have
heard them

FANNY
You could have had you gone - I was certain
you would

MR BROWN
I’m planning daily but I fear I have left it
too late

FANNY

Why not leave now travel overland

Abigail walks smilingly into the room holding out the crying
baby to show Fanny Mr Brown waves Abigail and the baby
away

MR BROWN
It’s not simple with the baby and my funds
reduced then there’s the snows

FANNY (SAYS IT OR SILENTLY GIVES THIS
IMPRESSION)
And lack of will
BLUE PAGES 040408 89

MR BROWN
Should I say it aloud Will that satisfy you
I have failed John Keats - I have failed him
And I pay a price daily - I did not know till
now how tightly he had wound himself about my
heart

FANNY
What heart You abandon your ill friend
never replying or enquiring

MR BROWN
Fortunately in my absence he was not short of
care his letter was full of your family’s
kindness

FANNY
And my love

Mr Brown is a little stunned moved despite himself by her
open confession

MR BROWN (LEAVING)
He asked me to offer whatever comfort can be
given to you

INT BRAWNE DINING ROOM WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 153

Fanny sews a seam in BLACK THREAD Outside it is SNOWING
The DOOR BELL RINGS Margaret answers It is a LETTER She
puts it on the other end of the table

MARGARET
For you Maman it’s from Italy

Fanny stops sewing alarmed Mrs Brawne slowly rises and
walks to the letter She glances at Fanny who is waiting
fearfully Mrs Brawne opens the letter

MRS BRAWNE
It’s from Keats in Naples He says it looks
like a dream

Mrs Brawne stops reading and looks at Fanny who shakes her
head with relief and disappointment

FANNY
Why doesn’t he write to me

Fanny looks out into the garden where a bowed Brown reads a
letter

Mr Brown stands at his window looking out onto a dreary BARE
WINTER GARDEN
BLUE PAGES 040408 90

He watches as Margaret and Samuel kick a BALL between them
and beyond them the gaunt upright figure of Fanny slowly
comes into view A mirror match in mood to himself she
paces ghostlike in the snow Fanny and Brown lock eyes then
each look away

155 INT BROWN’S DRAWING ROOM WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAY 155

Fanny knocks at Mr Brown’s garden door Mr Brown is
surprised to see her he stands

FANNY
You once said you would offer what comfort you
could

MR BROWN

Yes of course come in

FANNY
Is there something anything at all you can
read me from his letters I am disappointed
to have none of my own Any sort of news
even the painful brings me closer

MR BROWN
The latest letters are all from Severn Keats
I’m afraid is in a deplorable state

Mr Brown sorts through his correspondence

MR BROWN (contd)
I have some older ones from Keats

FANNY
Please

MR BROWN
“I can bear to die - I cannot bear to leave
her Oh God God God Every thing I have in
my trunks that reminds me of her goes through
me like a spear”

Mr Brown looks up to judge Fanny’s reaction She is not
shocked but transported

MR BROWN (contd)
“The silk lining she put in my travelling cap
scalds my head My imagination is horribly
vivid about her - I see her - I hear her O
that I could be buried near where she lives
I am afraid to write to her - to receive a
letter from her - to see her hand writing
would break my heart My dear Brown what am
I to do Where can I look for consolation or
ease I have coals of fire in my breast It
surprised me that the human heart is capable
of containing and bearing so much misery

(MORE )
BLUE PAGES 040408 91

MR BROWN (contd)

Was I born for this end God bless her and

her mother”

The letter is to me but it is all about you -

keep it
Fanny shakes her head They look at each other with
something like peace like compassion for what they both had
and for what they must soon bear

Fanny turns and Mr Brown watches as Fanny’s ghostlike figure
disappears down the hall

The FRONT DOOR OPENING and CLOSING then FOOTSTEPS in the
hall outside attracts Fanny’s attention She turns towards
the door poised Mrs Brawne notices and watches the door
anxiously Samuel stops playing as a sombre Mr Brown enters
the room

Fanny observes Mr Brown sinkingly her breath suspended

MR BROWN
It is cold out How are you all

Fanny notices a letter from Mr Severn in Mr Brown’s hand

MRS BRAWNE
We are all quite well enough But how is Mr
Keats

MR BROWN

It is as unbearable to me as I know it is to
you Mr Keats has died at only 25 years Mr
Severn sent me an account I have copied it
for you Miss Brawne - shall I read it

Fanny nods

MR BROWN (contd)
Friday 23rd February
“At four in the afternoon Keats called me
“Severn - Severn - lift me up for I am dying -
I shall die easy - don’t be frightened thank
God it has come” At one point a cold heavy
sweat broke out over his whole body and he
whispered “Don’t breathe on me it comes like
ice” Keats died imperceptibly
BLUE PAGES 040408 92

FANNY
No more

Mr Brown stops reading

Fanny makes her way shakily from the room Mrs Brawne
follows Fanny collapses on the staircase

FANNY (cont’d)
I should have been with him I should have
held him - it should have been me with him
Oh my God I am finished He is gone Oh
Maman help me please help me

Mr Brown and Samuel listen stricken Margaret sits on the
couch tears dropping onto her frock

EXT SPANISH STEPS ROME - DAWN 159

A small funeral procession of TWO COACHES waits by the PIETRO
BERNINI FOUNTAIN at the bottom of the SPANISH STEPS Keatss
COFFIN is loaded into a BLACK FUNERAL COACH The small
procession clatters through Rome’s still sleeping streets

KEATS (VO)
“Lamia’ he cried - and no soft-toned reply
The many heard and the loud revelry
Grew hush the stately music no more breathes
The myrtle sicken’d in a thousand wreaths
By faint degrees voice lute and pleasure
ceased
A deadly silence step by step increased
Until it seem’d a horrid presence there
And not a man but felt the terror in his
hair”

INT FANNY’S BEDROOM WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAWN 160

In the DIM FIRST LIGHT an exhausted Fanny is sewing her BLACK
FROCK She makes a KNOT and CUTS the thread Across the bed
are strewn KEATSS POETRY BOOKS and his LETTERS In the
next bed sleeps Margaret her arms about her mother’s neck
who sleeps fully dressed Fanny pulls the BLACK FROCK over
her head one sleeve yet unmade and the hem unfinished

INT FANNY’S BEDROOM WENTWORTH HOUSE - DAWN 161

With three chops of her big PINKING SHEARS Fanny cuts her
hair short Her BLACK HAIR falls in a circle about her feet
She takes her RED BOUND BOOK of Keats’s poems 1820 her copy
of ENDYMION and quietly leaves the room with her BONNET and
BLACK BOOTS in her hand Mrs Brawne rises as she leaves

Fanny draws on her COAT and BLACK GLOVES She opens the front
door and steps into the chilled and misty air

EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAWN 163

Out on the Heath Fanny walks briskly through the winter MIST
followed at a respectful distance by a hurriedly dressed
Samuel Fanny the landscape the trees Samuel APPEARING
and VANISHING in the FOG Clutching her precious KEATS BOOKS
against her chest Fanny makes her way up the side of the
HILL where she and the landscape completely disappear only
her VOICE continues steadily reciting learning by heart the
poem BRIGHT STAR dedicated to her

FANNY (VO)
“Bright Star would I were stedfast as thou
art -
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And watching with eternal lids apart
Like nature’s patient sleepless Eremite
(devotee)
The moving waters at their priest like task
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen masque
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors
No - yet still stedfast still unchangeable
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast
To feel forever its soft swell and fall
Awake forever in a sweet unrest
Still still to hear her tender-taken breath
And so live ever - or else swoon to death”

Fanny now alone walks on the Heath until in the dark she
pauses beside the POND Overhead the STARS GLITTER and are
REFLECTED again at her feet
