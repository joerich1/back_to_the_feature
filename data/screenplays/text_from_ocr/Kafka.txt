KAFKA

by

Lem Dobbs

PRAGUE - MORNING

The Old Town is quiet Its very early in the twisted
streets of this ancient ghetto Dark corners casting a
medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their
romance and mystery

The River is the dividing line Elegant gardens on the
opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New
Town tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky

An empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street

A Gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city
Its half-moon arches becoming circles as they meet their
reflections in the water Thin mist swirls over the

cobblestones above

A few boats in the water Fishermen casting their lines in
silence One or two lights now burning in buildings beyond

In the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral
strikes six

CUT
A MANS FACE

His eyes filled with terror beads of sweat crawling on his
brow

He stands in the middle of a murky courtyard perfectly
still Waiting Watching

The balconies overlooking on successive floors looming all
around him are empty All is quiet
The mans name is EDUARD He dares not move for fear of
missing a single sound And then he hears it A small noise
of movement nearby He runs

TINY ALLEYWAY

He runs alone in the dim light of the deserted morning
CROOKED PASSAGEWAY

Running for his life

NARROW LANE

Running on sheer pumping fear long after the verge of
collapse

BLACK TUNNEL

Coming out into the light but by no means out of danger he
allows himself a brief pause gasping for air just for a
moment looking back into the gloom starting to retreat again
even as he does then turning running

WINDING STREET

He runs on past boarded-up houses and shuttered inns
strange relics of the Middle Ages casting frightening
shadows

AROUND A CORNER

Eduard appears suddenly quickly flattens himself back
against the large notice board that covers the wall here
layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on
it

He breathes painfully in short bursts as silently as he
can He watches the corner hes just come from the ornate
archway through which any pursuer must emerge

Nothing there But then a shadow moves

Eduards shoulders tense His eyes widen He holds his
breath

The shadow spreading
Eduard edges away ever so slowly keeping his unblinking gaze

on the archway backing off one arm brushing the notice
board as he feels his way along it macabre images on the
posters some torn and incomplete revealing other fragments
behind Eduards eyes staring constant no noise here at all
and --

A HAND clamps over his face from behind All of a sudden
and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about
it

But he tries his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps
him an arm of iron

The hand is huge It covers Eduards face almost entirely
only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers ghastly
fingers that just for a second seem almost inhuman perhaps
even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand a hand
covered in scar tissue starting to squeeze as it pulls
Eduard swiftly away

CUT
A ROW OF TYPEWRITERS - DAY

Clacketing incessantly under slightly more agile and refined
fingers Beyond these another row of desks And beyond
that another the office workers in their neat suits tapping
away

And beyond that another at which one worker scribbles
furiously at his figures the next rolls a new sheet into his
typewriter the next answers his clanging telephone the next
rifles through the pages of a massive record book the next
sits erect in his chair playing his machine like a piano and
the last by the window dusty light streaming across him
contemplatively taps the end of a pencil onto his desk This
is KAFKA

A rather tall young man with a kind sensitive face
sensitive perhaps because his eyes ears and nose seem
slightly bigger and more inquiring than most and his gaze
one of almost unrelenting intensity

Hes looking off at something now

A desk not very far from his own But empty The chair
pushed squarely under it The typewriter covered

Kafka is wondering why -- when his concentration is
interrupted

BURGEL
Kafka
Kafka turns to see BURGEL a creep

BURGEL
The keeper of the files is still
waiting for your final summation
of the Erlanger claim

KAFKA
I gave it to him yesterday

BURGEL
(doesnt understand)
You didnt give it to me

KAFKA
No I left it in his office

BURGEL
Did you see him

KAFKA
Ive never seen him I dont
believe there is a keeper of the
files

BURGEL

Hes usually in the storage room
sorting things out He cant
close the file on a case until he
has the concluding report

KAFKA
He has it he just hasnt noticed
it yet all right

BURGEL
Whos to say he ever will Hes
a timid old man and quite careful
not to tread on anyones toes --
In fact Im the only one he trusts
and he wouldnt even look at a
document if it didnt first come
through me

Burgel just wont go away Kafka tries to get on with his
work

BURGEL
In an organization as efficient as
ours if a document once in a great
while gets lost it might never be
found at all
KAFKA
(tiring of this)
Burgel I thought it would be
easier as long as I was passing --

BURGEL
But Im the messenger An error
like this damages my credibility

KAFKA
Your credibility -- yes its well
known
BURGEL
(flushed)

When I deliver a message the very
act of delivering it you might say
gives it an official stamp and only
in this way are both the sender and
the receiver satisfied that it was
delivered at all

KAFKA
Ill commit that to memory

They stare at each other with mutual antagonism
BURGEL
Your position in this firm is not
unassailable
He waddles away

KAFKA

Has one more look over at the empty desk before returning to
his work

THE OFFICE

The desks make a checkerboard pattern of the huge floor as
Burgel calculates his path among them

CUT
LODGING HOUSE - MIDDAY
Kafka comes up the stairs to the top landing He knocks ona

door Waits Knocks again Leans a little closer to listen
for a moment then goes away back down the stairs
GROUND FLOOR

Kafka comes through the door that divides the stairs from the
hall goes to knock on the door of the first apartment down
here

BIZARRE VOICE
Yes

KAFKA
Im sorry to disturb you -- I
wonder if you know where my
friend Eduard is

BIZARRE VOICE

I cant hear you -- Youd better
come in

APARTMENT

Kafka comes in tentatively seeing the CONCIERGE in a far
corner of the cluttered room in bed covers tucked right up
to her chin

KAFKA
-- I didnt want to bother you

CONCIERGE
Well you have What do you
want

KAFKA

(pointing upstairs)
My friend Eduard I wonder if youve
seen him He hasnt been in to
work I thought he might be ill

CUT
STAIRS

The Concierge trudges up to the top floor Kafka following
guiltily

KAFKA
You didnt have to get out of
bed -- I could have taken the key

CONCIERGE
Yes Im sure you could

She treats him like dirt
EDUARDS ROOM

The door unlocks and the two of them come in Kafka goes to
open the window curtain He turns around to see the
Concierge already poking about in drawers

He ignores her and looks around the room on his own Eduard
isnt here Nothing else seems out of place He wonders
instead how he can dissuade the Concierge from her
unbelievable snooping

KAFKA
Well hes not here

The Concierge takes a tie from one of the drawers and models
it over her own ample chest

KAFKA
Do you think you ought to do
that

She looks at him indignantly

CONCIERGE
The manners of a tramp Its my
house isnt it

CUT
OFFICES - AFTERNOON

Kafka is in another section of the building finding his way
through a department hes vaguely unfamiliar with He
searches out a particular person -- a strikingly beautiful
woman with flaming hair and wild eyes

KAFKA
Miss Rossmann

GABRIELA looks around from a file cabinet

KAFKA
Im Kafka -- I work upstairs in
Accident --

GABRIELA
I know

KAFKA

Youre a friend of Eduard Rabans
GABRIELA
Why would you suppose so

KAFKA
Oh -- well I thought he once
mentioned --

GABRIELA

(shuts file cabinet)
One of you must be mistaken

He follows her to a counter where someone stamps the document
she thrusts forward without even glancing at her or it

KAFKA
Im sorry but I just wondered --

GABRIELA
(brushing past him)
Excuse me I have to copy this for
Central Docketing by 230

Kafka watches her go -- then notices some smarmy young clerks
giggling over what they suppose was a romantic rebuff

CUT
KAFKAS DEPARTMENT

Burgel sees Kafka coming back in toward his desk immediately
walks to intersect him

BURGEL
Youre late -- I knew it would
happen one day

Kafka ignores him utterly leaving Burgel standing clutching
his files with a sour expression

Kafka pauses at Eduards desk still untouched then
continues on to his own

OFFICE OF THE CHIEF CLERK

Partitioned off from the rest but commanding a full view of
all Through the glass windows the CHIEF CLERK a stern-
Looking fellow notices Kafka and takes his watch out of his
pocket for a look

CUT

THE OFFICE BELL - EVENING
RINGS signalling the end of the work day The office
workers clear their desks start to leave

OFFICE STAIRWELL

The office workers stream down the stairs that wind around a
central elevator shaft the gated elevator grinding upwards
at the same time

When Kafka reaches the ground floor he passes a pair of
SENIOR PARTNERS conferring together -- and does a double-take
when he hears his name mentioned -- then sees the two men
shake hands conclusively and turn away Kafka continues
walking away himself worried about his future

OUTSIDE

The office workers pour out of the building all going in
different directions Three of them get jammed in the
doorway untangle themselves and Kafka is the next to
emerge

CUT
THE CONTINENTAL COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

A lively place crowded with chattering smoking arguing
students poets painters

Kafka joins a group of friends Its clear that this is a
regular gathering and from their warm reception considered
incomplete without him

MARGARETE
-- This is our friend Anna who
works with us on the magazine

KAFKA
Hello

ANNA
Ive been hearing all about you

Kafka cringes
ERNST
Dont worry Kafka -- I championed

your virtues

KAFKA
Id like to hear them
JULIUS
Annas new to the city -- we
wouldnt frighten her needlessly

KAFKA
Ive lived all my life in this city
-- it frightens me As it draws me
closer into its web

STELLA
-- This is an ancient lament

KAFKA
No but do you realize why -- it
has no present

ANNA
-- Im hoping to live in the Old
Quarter

KAFKA
Even the so-called New Town isnt
so new Only the people People
of the future living in buildings
of the past
(abruptly)
Has anyone seen Eduard

MARGARETE
Who

My friend Eduard from the office --
Ive brought him here lots of times
-- you used to marvel at his travel
stories

JULIUS
Oh him

KAFKA
What dyou mean oh him Hes
a perfectly nice person hes never
missed a day before

ERNST
Perhaps hes taken up with those
traveling players you two were
so fond of

KAFKA
No its me who always wanted to
run away with them -- except that
that life would be far too hectic
for me Im worried about him no
ones seen him

STELLA
Havent you ever called in sick
and gone roaming about free of
responsibility to anyone if only
for a day

KAFKA
When you work for a medical firm
you cant call in sick They know
malingerers like a dog knows fleas

ANNA
You work in the insurance department

KAFKA
You have been hearing the sordid
side then

MARGARETE
Be pleased -- you constantly inspire
people to take an interest in your
life

ANNA
I should think its very interesting
work

Kafka shrugs shyly
KAFKA

My father always said I had
no ambition

CUT
NEAR THE FRONT DOOR - LATER
Smoke heavier in the air the coffee house more crowded with

strange groups of characters Kafka and his friends
preparing to leave

STELLA

The cabaret will be packed this

time of night -- well never get in
JULIUS

Well it has to be the cabaret
because theres nowhere else to go

MARGARET
Home I think

JULIUS
Home

MARGARET
(head on Ernsts shoulder)
You know I cant stay up late

VOICE
Home is the last resort --

BIZZLEBEK

The owner of the voice A man sitting at the bar nearby
turning on his stool to face them A dissipated dandy of a
man

ERNST
(introducing him)
-- Do you know Bizzlebek --
the gravedigger

BIZZLEBEK
Stonecutter if you please

MARGARETE
Sculptor if only hed admit it

BIZZLEBEK
No one should admit being an artist
unless theyre paid for it If
you go to the cabaret mention my
name -- theyll find a table for you

Turning round again

ERNST
Bizzlebek has ways and means denied
lesser mortals It comes from working
in the cemetery all day -- hes able
to transcent the physical world

Bizzlebek turns round again with a bored sign
BIZZLEBEK

No -- it only makes me view people
dispassionately as so many slabs
He looks about characterizing various coffee house types

BIZZLEBEK
Quartz slate gravel
granite flint
(and then)

Marble

Its GABRIELA from the office Kafka is surprised to see
her instinctively walking over to where shes sitting at a
far table

JULIUS
My God look hes marching forward
willingly to make human contact

Anna smiles Shes interested in Kafka (Which means we
must see this warm attractive girl as a threat a curse a
trap)

GABRIELA

--On the other hand is an enticement Kafka cant help
walking towards her Sitting with her own friends though
there is something less than friendly about them Two men
two women

GABRIELA
(as Kafka comes over)
Hello again

KAFKA
Ive never seen you here before

GABRIELA
Have you looked

Kafka feels as awkward as she knows he feels He looks to
her friends expecting an introduction but no one makes a
move

KAFKA
Well -- nice to know life exists
outside the office

GABRIELA
(ironic)
Yes

Kafka nods goodbye and walks away berating himself for
banality
CUT
OUTSIDE - NIGHT
Kafka resists going along with the others

KAFKA
No really I have to go home too

MARGARETE
Were keeping him from his true
vocation

JULIUS

I know he consists of writing
We wouldnt be his friends if we
didnt threaten his solitude

Julius is a little drunk The others help him with his coat
ANNA

Has a private moment with Kafka

ANNA
Where do you live

KAFKA
Up there

He gestures in the direction of the River and the castle
that looms on a far hill beyond huge and brooding regally
dominating the city

ANNA
I tried finding a place on Castle
Hill when I arrived I wanted to
share the majesty

(The majesty of marriage is what he fears she represents
This innocent scene could very well be a subjective
Kafkaesque nightmare as sinister in its own way as any of the
more outright horrific scenes to come)

KAFKA
Its only majestic from here
When you get closer you see it
for what it really is

ANNA
What is it really
KAFKA
A glorified office block They
keep all the old records there --
the final resting place for facts
and figures that have ceased to
matter in the world of the living

ANNA
Well as long as I admire it from
afar it shouldnt worry me if its

hollow
(The castle of marriage tempts him -- but would suffocate
him)

KAFKA

Its more than hollow Its

stillborn For all its size it

serves no purpose Its just

there -- like death -- hovering

over a breathing city
THE OTHERS

Turn back into the picture Margarete pats Kafka
sympathetically

MARGARETE
Dont worry about your friend --
Im sure hell turn up

ERNST
(a parting word)
What are you working on Kafka

KAFKA
Im writing a story about a man
who wakes up one morning to find
himself transformed into a giant
insect

His friends glance at each other surreptitiously and dont

know what to say -- other than goodnight
KAFKA
Turns to go -- when he notices Bizzlebek leaning listlessly

in the coffee house doorway A figure in the shadows

BIZZLEBEK
Ive read your stories Theyre
fantastic
KAFKA
(not sure if he
believes him)
I dont know what you could have
read

BIZZLEBEK
Just what youve published

KAFKA
-- In magazines nobody reads

BIZZLEBEK
I read the one about the penal
colony

KAFKA

(cautious)
Did you

BIZZLEBEK
The needles inscribing the
judgement into the flesh of the
man
(looks impressed)
Very good

Kafka suspects hes being mocked But perhaps not
Bizzlebek steps out buttoning his coat

BIZZLEBEK
If I could sculpt as well as that
Id be quite proud of myself

Hes already quite proud of himself -- tossing his scarf over
his shoulder with a flourish -- and striding off into the
night

CUT

THE CASTLE - NIGHT

Seen from just below from the ancient cemetery that borders
its high impregnable imperial walls The all-seeing-eye of
the city An awesome edifice

THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER

Kafka walking across from the Old Quarter toward the New
Town
He passes some working-class types who seem vaguely
threatening Do they mutter some remark behind his back

CUT
ALCHEMISTS ROW - NIGHT

A bizarre street Tiny little houses that look fashioned by
a toymaker all bunched tightly next to each other forming a
continuous rooftop of odd configurations and angles and
pointed chimneys The street named after practitioners of
the black arts and dark sciences who inhabited it in the
Sixteenth Century

Kafkas house is toward the back a light shining from the
single upper window Through it Kafka is seen sitting at
the only desk that really matters to him -- his writing one

KAFKAS ROOM

Hes struggling to get a sentence right -- rereading it to
himself

KAFKA
As Gregor Samsa awoke one
morning from disturbing dreams

he from unsettling dreams
uneasy dreams Gregor Samsa
Gregor

(wondering)

Carl George Rudolf
Suddenly theres a loud KNOCK on the front door below
DOWNSTAIRS
Kafka opens the tiny front door of this almost-miniature
little house Two intimidating MEN stand outside one tall
one short wearing similar black suits and grim expressions

CUT

ANOTHER DOOR - NIGHT
Kafka tries to match the exacting pace of his two warders
flanking him as they walk him along a corridor through
another doorway

MORGUE

Kafka tugs his collar up a bit his breath visible in the
air He has a feeling whats going to be under the sheet on
the lonely trolley in the middle of the room before the first
man summons him over to it

Kafka goes The first man yanks the sheet off the face in
one quick movement The face of Eduard White and bloated
the tongue jutting the eyes bulging

Kafka recoils stepping back instinctively

SECOND MAN
(still behind Kafka
at the door)
You know him

KAFKA
Yes

FIRST MAN
His name is Eduard Raban

KAFKA
Yes

And now he hears a stirring in a dark corner He looks up
again

A third man steps out of the shadows where hes been quietly
standing and walks over to Kafka He is a severe man
stolid dedicated and never smiles He reminds Kafka of his
father

MAN
(with an introductory
nod)
Inspector Grubach
CUT
INSPECTORS OFFICE - NIGHT

The Inspector behind his big desk Kafka in front of it

INSPECTOR

Kafka -- is that your real name
KAFKA

Yes Yes of course -- why

wouldnt it be

INSPECTOR
When was the last time you saw
Mr Raban
KAFKA
Wednesday We left the office
together

INSPECTOR
Did you go anywhere afterwards --
to have a drink perhaps

KAFKA
No we said goodbye outside the
building He went off as usual
toward his house

INSPECTOR
(consulting papers)
Your office is the Workmens --

KAFKA
-- Accident and Compensation
Association

INSPECTOR
Where youve been employed for
seven years

KAFKA
Eight -- and seven months
INSPECTOR
Engaged in the manufacture and
distribution of pills and so
forth
KAFKA
Well -- other departments are yes
INSPECTOR

Would you describe your relationship
with the dead man as close

KAFKA
Yes Since he came to the office
almost three years ago weve
been quite good friends
(pause)
How was Eduard

INSPECTOR
He was found in the River Could
he swim
Pause

HALLWAY

KAFKA
I dont know

INSPECTOR
Was he depressed

KAFKA
No He didnt seem to be Do
you think he drowned himself

INSPECTOR
Grown men dont normally fall
into the river do they

KAFKA
No I suppose not

INSPECTOR
(closing the file)
He might have had a drink or two
despite what you think

KAFKA
(as the interview
seems to be over)
Can I ask -- how you found me

INSPECTOR
His landlady knew of no other
friends to refer us to

KAFKA
I dont think he really had any
He had no family either

INSPECTOR
We know that

KAFKA
He wasnt a lonely man though

INSPECTOR
What makes you think so

KAFKA
Just a perception

CUT
Kafka comes out of a door that closes behind him

and waits
newspaper

At a high desk a POLICEMAN is reading a
Without even looking up from it he extends his
arm and pushes Kafka slightly to one side so
blocking the light

Two other MEN are here waiting sitting on a bench
Kafka glances down at himself wondering if
his appearance could in any way inspire ridicule

private joke

The door opens again and the Inspector is bac

Pause

INSPECTOR
I dont usually involve myself
with you people in the Old Quarter
-- but the River runs its own course
It wont be the last time it
deposits its unwanted debris on my
doorstep

KAFKA
Probably not

INSPECTOR
Anyway Id like you to reflect
that in me you have -- I wont say
a friend because were complete
fencers of course -- from
distinctly incompatible social
classes -- but to some extent shall

we say an interested third party

KAFKA
Ill bear that in mind

INSPECTOR
(hands Kafka his card)
-- Should you happen upon anything
that might be relevant

He nods curtly at Kafka and shuts his door

THE TROLLEY

With Eduards sheet-covered form on it

He stands

hes no longer

sharing a

coming down the hall

the SQUEAKING WHEELS of the thing loud on the wooden floor

KAFKA
The noise causes him to turn around He watches the trolley
as its pushed past

CUT
AN OFFICE TROLLEY - DAY
Similarly coffin-like loaded with files
KAFKA

Edges out of the way to let it by feeling as though it has
been made for him is waiting for him

He walks on to the Chief Clerks office
CHIEF CLERKS OFFICE
Kafka comes in

KAFKA
You wanted to see me sir

CHIEF CLERK
(indicates a chair)
Sit down Kafka

Kafka does And the Chief Clerk stands up He paces up and
down a bit making Kafka awfully nervous before he finally
clears his throat and starts to get to the point

CHIEF CLERK
Youve been with the firm for
nearly nine years Youve done
your work diligently there are no
complaints on that score But
theres more to the job than the
work -- there are other people to
consider -- and frankly Kafka we
eel your social situation could
bear improving

KAFKA
My social situation

CHIEF CLERK
You keep too much to yourself --
youre a lone wolf It makes me
uneasy and if it makes me uneasy
I cant imagine the impression you
make on lesser employees
The Chief Clerk towering over him also reminds Kafka of his
father Kafka tries putting up a defense

KAFKA
To do my work well I have little
time for --

CHIEF CLERK
You must make the time Where
do you go off to in the lunch
hour

KAFKA
I usually take lunch by the River

CHIEF CLERK
Its not healthy Kafka -- not for
you and not for your workmates At
the annual dinner this month you
again failed to make an appearance

KAFKA
I did not realize it was obligatory

CHIEF CLERK

Have you never wondered -- and I
mention this only in passing --

(as he paces past and

Kafka turns his head)
why other clerks have advanced to
more responsible positions while you
who have been here longer have not

KAFKA
No sir

CHIEF CLERK
Attitude Kafka It doesnt matter
how well you do your work -- you
still see it as something to be
gotten on with rather than something
to take an active interest in

KAFKA
(leans forward in
rebuttal)
Well I --

CHIEF CLERK
(keeps pacing)
Oh I know you got along with that
poor fellow -- what was his name
KAFKA

-- Eduard --

CHIEF CLERK
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too
much like you -- even more so

perhaps He wasnt here as long as
you so I didnt know him as well --
but I could see the influence he was
having I simply want you to be
aware of this because youll be
happier for it

Kafka merely nods starts to get up

CHIEF CLERK
n any case -- dont ask me why --
the word has come down youre to
be promoted

Kafka sits back down in the chair

CHIEF CLERK
Your colleagues death has helped
precipitate the need though I can
tell you its been under
consideration for some time Youre
to be given two assistants anda
commensurate rise in salary

(sits back behind

desk)
Thats all

Kafka nods once starts to go again

Kafka turns

CHIEF CLERK
Kafka

CHIEF CLERK
I understand you fancy yourself an
author

KAFKA
(almost visibly
cringes)
In a small way

CHIEF CLERK
You might find a more athletic
hobby -- put some color in your
cheeks

He returns to his paperwork Kafka leaves
OUTSIDE CHIEF CLERKS OFFICE

Walking away Kafka notices Gabriela striding along an office
corridor -- and sneaky Burgel confronting her

GABRIELA

She looks distressed walking tall as if to bolster her
composure Sneaky Burgel does not help matters by
characteristically appearing from the sidelines

BURGEL
Good morning --
(she ignores him)
Or should I say good afternoon

GABRIELA
Say what you like -- no one pays
the least attention

BURGEL
(walking quickly
alongside her)
Oh dont they I think you
underestimate my station in this
office and overrate your own

GABRIELA
Not today Burgel Send one of
your memos write up one of your
communiques but for Gods sake
dont bother me today

BURGEL
Its my place to offer advice not
yours -- and by advising the Chief

Clerk of your unpunctuality its
certainly not my situation thats
compromised if thats what youre

implying
GABRIELA
(stops to glare at
him)

Youre just doing your job

BURGEL
Its what Im paid to do

GABRIELA
Youre detestable

BURGEL
And youre late

Suddenly in a terrific release of pent-up emotion she slaps
him hard across the cheek the first of what would be a
flurry of blows if not for the fact that the unexpected force
of it throws Burgel reeling backwards before she can deliver
any more Instead she rushes away very upset

KAFKA
As startled as the rest of the office by the incident

Burgel recovers straightening up in shock and
embarrassment He immediately resolves to march directly to
the office of the Chief Clerk

Seeing him coming Kafka quickly starts away
CUT
THE ASSISTANTS - DAY

OSKAR and LUDWIG They look almost the same At first
glance almost identical Its only a closer inspection that
shows them to be imperfect twins Dressed in matching suits

One is sitting on Kafkas new desk the other in Kafkas new
chair Theyre rummaging about in his papers and whenever
one selects a particular document for closer scrutiny the
other promptly snatches it out of his hand

KAFKA

Coming this way has paused having spotted the weird duo
THE ASSISTANTS

Continue with their mischief until one of them notices Kafka
coming and nudges the other so strongly he almost falls

over Theyre both standing at attention looking guilty by
the time Kafka arrives

KAFKA
My assistants I presume

ASSISTANTS
Yes -- thats us

Kafka smiles at them half in friendliness half in amusement
at their quirky appearance

KAFKA
(offers his hand)
Im Kafka

Oskar responds first but Ludwig knocks his hand out of the
way to get there first

LUDWIG
(shaking hands)
Ludwig

OSKAR
(now its his turn)
Oskar

KAFKA
You look like brothers

ASSISTANTS
Yes -- we do

KAFKA
Have you worked here long

ASSISTANTS
No no no -- quite a long time
yes

Kafka doesnt quite know what to make of these two but they
seem pleasant enough fellows and theyre looking at him with
such wide-eyed innocence he doesnt know what more to say to
them So he turns to look around the new area hes been
assigned -- a burrow all to himself now -- even a personal
clothes peg on the wall for his coat

The Assistants make stupid faces at each other behind his
back but look serious again when he turns around

KAFKA
Well wed better move things
from my old desk

ASSISTANTS
Look at each other with identical frowns then back at

Kafka Oskar nods as if to say oh all right if we
must And Ludwig grins
CUT
KAFKAS NEW OFFICE - DAY

Kafka types up forms He hears some noise and glances over
his shoulder to see how the Assistants are getting on --
theyre sharing another desk facing each other and seem to
be working quietly though with pouting expressions

Kafka rolls a new form into the typewriter -- when a shadow
falls over the page

GABRIELA
Eduard and I had lunch together
one day and you saw us

Kafka looks up at her He nods

KAFKA
On the Embankment

CUT

THE EMBANKMENT - MIDDAY

Kafka and Gabriela stroll by the River Kafka finishing off
his lunch as they go occasionally offering tidbits to
Gabriela who either samples or refuses them

GABRIELA
I was having an affair with
Eduard
(notes Kafkas reaction)
He didnt tell you

KAFKA
No

GABRIELA
He would have You were his best
friend A better friend than me

KAFKA
I suspected that he -- well
GABRIELA
What
KAFKA
That he was -- satisfied in that

regard I didnt want to pry
GABRIELA
(throws her hair
back proudly)
Its not that we wanted to deceive
anyone -- but you know how these
things are looked upon at the office

Kafka lets out a smile at that Gabriela is suspicious of
smiles

GABRIELA
Whats funny

KAFKA
This morning it was suggested to
me that my own sense of office
fellowship could bear improving

GABRIELA
As long as its on their terms
If your work and your private
life dont correspond to their
specifications youre labelled a
dangerous agitator -- with no
recourse whatsoever

The gnarled barren branches of a nearby tree shiver over the
two of them

KAFKA
How long were you and Eduard --

GABRIELA
Two or three months thats all
(adds)
-- I seduced him

HIGH TERRACE

A flight of stone steps takes them up here to this vantage
spot overlooking the River and the city beyond Kafka stands
by a railing -- and the huge distorted shadow of SOMEONE
looms suddenly on the high wall under him

GABRIELA
You know as well as I do that he
didnt commit suicide

Kafka looks at her

KAFKA
No I dont Im amazed that anyone
is able to bear life with any
assurance at all

GABRIELA
Eduard didnt see it as something
that needed bearing

KAFKA
The police would know the
difference wouldnt they

GABRIELA
Do you think people in the New
Town care what happens over here
(nodding across the
water)
This will always be the ghetto

KAFKA
He wasnt robbed He was
identified by his wallet

GABRIELA
And you believe everything the
authorities tell you

KAFKA
When I have no reason to doubt

GABRIELA
The very fact that theyre
authorities should give you reason
People will do anything to protect
their own interests For all you
know he was killed at the hands of
the police

KAFKA
-- What could he have done to
warrant that

For a moment she seems about to tell him but then looks
away Kafka follows her gaze

IN THE DISTANCE

Someone else has paused at the embankment wall further away
to stare at the roiling water Hes too far away to see
clearly Probably nothing sinister about him at all

Still
GABRIELA
Turns back to Kafka

GABRIELA
Are you free tonight

KAFKA
Tonight

GABRIELA
There are some people Id like you
to meet Can you come to the
Musil district at eight oclock

KAFKA
All right

Her eyes lock on his for a moment Shes beautiful Hes
fearful

GABRIELA
You almost married recently
didnt you

KAFKA
Last year I -- it was broken
off

GABRIELA

Eduard wanted to marry me

KAFKA
And you

GABRIELA
Im suspicious of men who want
to marry I believe they think
its the only thing that will
make them equal to their fathers

THE SHADOW ON THE WALL BENEATH

Disappears the ominous black mass flowing off the large flat
surface as abruptly as it arrived While up there on the
terrace we see Gabriela walk away from Kafka

KAFKA

Stays where he is a moment watching her He may have found
his ideal woman
KAFKA
(then follows
behind her)
-- I dont know the Musil
district

GABRIELA
(without turning)
You wont have any trouble finding
it

CUT
FAT MEN - NIGHT

Sit laughing jowls gyrating around a table filled with an
abnormal amount of food One of them stops laughing then
and the others follow suit one after the other in turn
until theyre all silent looking at the same thing

Were in a fancy restaurant and the other customers have
also turned away from their dinners for the moment to stare
at the Man in Black who stands before the Fat Men

The man wears a black mask as well He presents the Fat Men
with a covered tray They look at it then back at him --

but hes walked away They look at the tray again -- and one
of them lifts the cover Underneath lies the classic black
bowling ball -- with a fuse burning at the top The Fat Men

all try to stand up at once but --
BOOM Their booth explodes with them in it
At the doorway holding a revolver loosely in one hand to
discourage heroes the Man in Black turns calmly to face the
stunned restaurant
MAN IN BLACK
(hoarse voice)
Long live anarchy
He leaves Fire in his wake
CUT

THE OLD TOWN - NIGHT
Kafka walks the crooked streets -- in the direction of the
plume of smoke and illumination coming from the burning

restaurant

In the dark distance behind him there seems to be a person
following him
NOISY BEER SHOP

Neighborhood denizens have come out hearing all the
excitement not far away Kafka walks past He looks behind
him but the following figure has gone

TWISTED LITTLE STREET

Kafka comes around a curve -- and sees ahead a dark figure
a black cape standing waiting under a lone lamppost When
Kafka gets a bit nearer the figure starts to walk slowly
away as if expecting Kafka to follow

DIRTY YARD

The dark figure walks alongside a row of black window panes
turning around the corner where they end Kafka follows
around the corner -- and through a dingy doorway

A LOPSIDED STAIRWAY
Leads him up to a large attic Warning shadows
ATTIC

Gloomy except for the light around a table at a far end
Kafka advances seeing Gabriela sitting there with her same
companions from the coffee house Kafka stops in front of
the table

VOICE FROM BEHIND
Please sit down

Kafka turns to see the last of the group come in having
obviously tailed him all along A burly man with a BEARD
The leader of this anarchist cell

Kafka sits down in between a SOLEMN man with a moustache and
a woman with a POCKMARKED face The seedy YOUTH who led him
in completes the circle

BEARDED ANARCHIST
Well save the introductions
(takes his seat)
We dont know yet if youre friend
or foe

KAFKA
Strangers make better foes than
friends Will you tell me who you
are altogether if not individually

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
Heralds of a new age -- does that
sound immodest

BEARDED ANARCHIST
You could say we represent the
unofficial view of a well-ordered

society
KAFKA
(to Gabriela)
Ah -- were back to the authorities

you spoke of

GABRIELA
Theyre ubiquitous What we try to
do is make them a little less so

BEARDED ANARCHIST
Quite a disturbance tonight yes
And perhaps you recall last month --
the explosion at the Municipal
Courthouse that sent one of the
examining magistrates to join the
heavenly choir

KAFKA
(disbelieving)
Was Eduard one of you

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
The last to join us the first to
leave us

Gabriela darts a fierce look at her overly-flippant
colleague And Kafka is sad about his dead friend for a
different reason

KAFKA
Why take me into your confidence

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
Thats obvious isnt it We
have an opening for a new member

After a moments pause Kafka stands up
GABRIELA

I nominated you as a possible
candidate You were Eduards good
friend He read me some of your
work

KAFKA
Ive hardly published enough for
anyone to draw conclusions from

GABRIELA
You strike me as a man with a
defined notion of injustice -- a
high concern for the lot of your
fellow men And yet youre able to
remain an outsider With the
concomitant air of superiority

BEARDED ANARCHIST
In short a higher man Its what
we want Its what we need

Kafka notices that the Bearded Anarchist has a tattoo on the
back of his hand

KAFKA
The distance to my fellow man is
for me quite a journey As for
being an outsider its never been
a matter of choice

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
(as Kafka starts to
leave)
-- They may have instituted proceedings
against you

KAFKA
(turns)
What proceedings

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
Preliminary investigations may already
be underway

BEARDED ANARCHIST
You were his friend One link is
all they need

Kafka sits down again He tries not to be distracted by the
Solemn Anarchist who says nothing but who takes an uncommon
interest in seeing how many matches there are in the matchbox
hes been fiddling with

GABRIELA
The day he died Eduard was called
up to the Castle Did you know that

KAFKA
(shakes his head)
What of it

GABRIELA
He was summoned to help correct a
minor discrepancy of some sort in
the Medical Records Division
Apparently one of his claims was
relevant

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
-- Merely in the interests of order
you understand The officials at
the Castle like to cover their tracks

GABRIELA
He was never seen alive again

KAFKA
And you still maintain -- what
That he was murdered

GABRIELA
He was murdered

A skylight casts moonglow over the proceedings

BEARDED ANARCHIST
As you can imagine a pass into

the Castle -- hardly ever granted --
was an opportunity we couldnt
ignore

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
The Castle represents every
anachronism that needs to be destroyed
if progress is to be made

BEARDED ANARCHIST
As you know its not the most
accessible location Far from being
depressed Eduard was particularly
excited when he brought us the news
of this chance invitation He set off
that evening carrying one of our
custom-made briefcases instead of
his own
GABRIELA
(gauging Kafkas reaction)
Youre shocked at the thought of
Eduard tossing a bomb through a
window

KAFKA
I have no right to be I know My
experience with real life is
practically nil

GABRIELA
When you only see someone sitting at
a desk all day its liable to
create a false impression

KAFKA
People must think the same of me --
a quiet dependable person

BEARDED ANARCHIST
You dont have to accept everything
as true my friend You need only
accept it as necessary

GABRIELA
As the bomb never went off we can
only assume he was caught with it --
and summarily executed

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
-- Merely in the interests of order

BEARDED ANARCHIST
The formality of a trial would be too
costly for them Theyre beginning
to understand that its the ensuing
news of our actions that incites
support

KAFKA
Propaganda of the dead

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
The Castle will deny he was there
any longer than his business required
Theyre just file clerks up there No
doubt he was handed over to the police
with the utmost discretion

BEARDED ANARCHIST
In any event weve felt no
repercussions as yet Eduard must not
have talked Youre the one they

contacted

KAFKA
So thats who my foes are -- policemen
and file clerks Law and order you
might say

The Solemn Anarchist looks up from his matchbox

GABRIELA
You think what were doing is so
wrong And what are you doing
Pursuing goodness For what To
answer to some supreme tribunal

KAFKA
My only concern is the human
tribunal Isnt it yours

GABRIELA
Yes -- which is why quiet
dependable people have to take
charge of their own lives

KAFKA

At the cost of others You accuse
people of murder without trial --
apparently without irony Did you
go to the Castle with Eduard

(apparently not)
Then you have no idea what really
might have happened that night at
all -- even before or after he got
there

He stands to leave again

GABRIELA
Your human tribunal will betray
you Just as its members will be
betrayed when they find no supreme
one

Kafka starts walking away

GABRIELA
Join us Kafka

Kafka keeps on going the anarchists growing smaller as
theyre left behind in their far corner of the long attic
GABRIELA
Its sheer folly for anyone to
try to pull through alone

CUT
MANIACAL LAUGHTER - BEFORE DAWN

Seeming to emanate from pitch blackness -- but then suddenly
fast out of a tunnel under a bridge come running three
terrified VAGRANTS roused from slumber and scared out

their wits by the ghastly crazed CACKLING chasing after
them ECHOING under the arches

Theyre at the rivers edge all running wildly slipping and
stumbling every man for himself as they desperately try to
escape from whatever madness is closing in behind them

Now from out of the tunnel appears their pursuer seen only
from the back literally shaking with insane involuntary
howling LAUGHTER A horrific human hyena far further gone
than the sad wretches hes cornered here on this foul
moss-covered ledge in the cold wind

eeing him the vagrants freeze in their various positions --
hen turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them
oving like an animal a killer predator laughing horribly

s he goes

9Bctn

The First Vagrant propelled by fright manages to make a
stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains
and pull himself up The Second Vagrant finds himself
trapped at the edge of the ledge -- with the Laughing Man
choosing him as the one to go after first He turns and
jumps into the river The Laughing Man face still unseen
turns toward the climbing vagrant instead -- who clambers
over the top just in time as the Laughing Mans fingernails
claw the moldy wall beneath him

The Third Vagrant has made it to some steps and down them --
glancing back to see the Laughing Man coming after him -- to
the small patch of muddy beach at the bottom grey river
water lapping at his ragged shoes He doesnt know what to
do -- he doesnt know how to swim The Laughing Man is
running down the steps now The Vagrant starts wading out
into the water crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him
come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward
splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his
ankles pulling him back

The Vagrants screams join the Laughing Mans insane giggles
as they thrash around violently in the water The Laughing
Man drags the Vagrant back to the beach then back up the
Steps the Vagrant struggling helplessly his head banging
from step to step his hands flailing around but finding
nothing to clutch onto his screaming going unheeded in this
lonely part of the sleeping city

The Laughing Man drags him on back to the slippery ledge and
along it dragging the Vagrant on his back through a filthy
sewer alongside the wall the Vagrants cries choked by the
stagnant water but continuing as the Laughing Man drags him
back into the dark tunnel under the bridge the two of them
disappearing into the blackness again their combined
SHRIEKING louder than ever as it ECHOES horribly around the
damp stone then dimming as they go deeper and further away
unseen until the screaming and the laughter can no longer be
distinguished

CUT
KAFKAS OFFICE - MORNING

Kafka walks toward his desk Nearing he sees the Assistants
laughing in lunacy between themselves They hush up
immediately when they notice him and are pretending to work
when he arrives He watches them out of the corner of his
eye as he arranges himself at his chair

KAFKA
How was your evening

At this sign of sympathy they immediately scuttle their
chairs closer to him

ASSISTANTS
Fine -- terrible

KAFKA
(uncovering his
typewriter)
What was the matter with it

OSKAR
(indicating Ludwig)
He cant sit still Just when we
arrive at a nightclub he wants to
go to another one

LUDWIG
(to Kafka)
You look tired
OSKAR
(interrupting)
Gabriela Rossman was here looking
for you Do you know her

KAFKA
(looking up)

Do you

OSKAR
We saw her naked once -- didnt we

He elbows Ludwig violently

LUDWIG
Women are all you have on your
mind

OSKAR
She went to the roof to sunbathe
one lunch hour -- we watched her
changing

KAFKA
I didnt realize youd been here
that long

OSKAR

You mean because its been a while
since there was a sunny day What
a good detective you are

LUDWIG
They keep switching us from
department to department He
doesnt mind because he cant sit
still

OSKAR

We used to be in the supply section

carrying boxes of medicine about
but we dropped too many of them

LUDWIG
Its not too bad working here

Kafka stands up pleased for them in their innocence

KAFKA
You dont think its a horrible
double life from which there is
probably no escape but insanity
The Assistants look at each other perplexed by this
attitude

LUDWIG
No

KAFKA
Im glad for you

He starts to go

OSKAR
(calling after him)
You should be content you know

The stick-like figure of Kafka turns into the long center
aisle walking between the endless rows of busy desks He
sidetracks taking a shortcut along a narrower aisle toward
the exit hes heading for Another clerk is coming the other
way and they both at the same instant turn sideways to sidle
efficiently by one another an almost balletic maneuver
perfected after years of office experience nothing more than
a short breath of air passing between them

CUT
GABRIELAS SECTION

Kafka working his way toward Gabrielas desk -- but he stops
before he gets to it a familiar shiver running through him

THE DESK

Empty The chair pushed squarely under it The typewriter
covered

KAFKA

Stares at it -- then at the ermine Mr Burgel who has once
again popped up out of nowhere

BURGEL
Are you looking for Gabriela
Rossmann

KAFKA
Yes

Burgel bows sarcastically to hand Kafka an envelope Then
chuckles spitefully obviously knowing something Kafka does
not He walks off leaving Kafka uneasy
CUT
EDUARDS LODGING HOUSE - DAY
Kafka bounds up the stairs
EDUARDS LANDING
The door to his room is open Kafka goes in
EDUARDS ROOM

Kafka comes in Gabriela is here gathering up Eduards
belongings from drawers

GABRIELA
(hardly glancing at
him)
Im collecting Eduards things
If theres anything you want take
it or Ill give it to charity

KAFKA
(taking her note
from his pocket)
Burgel gave me this -- what does
it mean

GABRIELA
(now looks up)
Burgel -- I didnt leave it with
him
KAFKA

(going closer)
Why were you given notice

GABRIELA
Theyre not obliged to tell

KAFKA
It couldnt be for that incident
with Burgel the other day

GABRIELA
Of course it could -- Burgels
been trying to get me thrown out
as long as I can remember He
couldve killed Eduard

KAFKA
You dont believe that

GABRIELA
I wouldnt put it past him

Shes stuffed the last of the clothes into a small bag
goes to take the few other possessions from shelves and
elsewhere

afka notices that hes standing by a dumbwaiter For lack
of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up
Its filled with more clothes Gabriela comes over with her
bag holding it out for him as Kafka puts the clothes in --
but not as many clothes as they thought Behind the bundle
hidden at the back is a briefcase

Gabriela recognizes it Kafka sees her surprised reaction
He removes the case and carefully flips the latches Inside
a complex mechanism wires connected to a clock -- anda
clump of dynamite

afka just looks at it sadly He closes the case

KAFKA
It seems I knew Eduard a little
bit after all

GROUND FLOOR OF BUILDING

The ratty old concierge peeks up the stairs inquisitively

In the doorway of his room a LODGER clips his fingernails at
a little folding table neatly lining them up The concierge
turns and notices

CONCIERGE
Lodgers Not one of them thinks

to spare me such spectacles

She slams the door on him then returns to her own apartment
slamming that door too The hallway is empty now

EDUARDS ROOM

Gabriela turns to Kafka

GABRIELA
You might think -- I thought so
myself at first -- that Burgels

too insignificant to be dangerous
But thats the very reason to beware
Its the small men to watch out for
-- the ones who substitute method
for character

KAFKA

(sighs at her

relentlessness)
Now youve fallen into his trap
When he goes to bed at night
Burgel dreams of inspiring as much
fear in others as they inspire in
him

GABRIELA
Its still easier for you to
understand suicide isnt it

Shes got his number Hes so in awe of her he has to turn
away -- looking out the rooms small window

KAFKA
That street down there -- I
always used to call it the approach
road for suicides It leads
straight down to the bridge and
the River

GABRIELA
Burgel hated Eduard And me Im
sure he knew about us -- and Im

sure it drove him mad

KAFKA
Burgel doesnt like anybody

GABRIELA
He used to like me -- very much
more than I liked him

KAFKA
Hes jealous yes but that
jealous Hes too cautious

Gabriela clears some more items off a mantelpiece with a
sweeping gesture

GABRIELA
Of course he is -- the Castle
precincts are not the safest part
of the city after dark People
disappear up there regularly If
you want to lie in wait for someone
thats the place to do it
KAFKA
Now youre saying Eduard was lured
there

GABRIELA
(puts away the last
few books)
How often does one of our clerks
have business in the house of records

KAFKA
Ive heard of it happening

GABRIELA
And Burgel is the bringer of
messages isnt he

KAFKA
Usually

Putting the bag down Gabriela goes closer to Kafka so close
he almost cowers

GABRIELA
Or what if there really was an
error -- I dont know what kind --

any kind that needed correcting --
and what if Burgel was responsible
for it One mistake -- even a small
one in a firm like ours -- it could
cost him a promotion

KAFKA
First these nameless authorities
were the root of all evil now its
insignificant Burgel If indeed
there was a mistake -- and a minor
one at that -- youre suggesting
someone went to a lot of trouble
over something so trivial as to
not matter at all

GABRIELA
What seems important to these
people is not determined by the
amount of work it entails -- youre
far from understanding the
authorities if you believe that

KAFKA
Now Burgels one of the authorities
She turns away from him reddening

GABRIELA
For all his big talk he is Does
he really have access to the Directors
of the firm as he always claims --
or only the Deputy Managers -- people
of no importance whatsoever Someone
ought to follow him for a change

Kafka sees an opportunity to go to her to try to calm her
to make a timid approach to this woman

KAFKA
You wont make any sense of it

while youre upset

-- But she breaks away

GABRIELA
Burgel is only there for one
purpose -- to spy on the employees

and report any and all indiscretions
real or imagined If he didnt
send Eduard to the Castle you can
be damn sure hes in league with
whoever greeted him there

(very upset now)
All those bastards are in league
with each other -- why cant you
see that

She takes hold of him as if to shake some sense into him --
but really because she needs someone to hold

KAFKA
I dont see anything I see
a message on its way to me -- with
all the right answers Only it
never arrives -- its always just
on its way

Gabriela doesnt seem to be listening Shes looking around
the little room as if its someone else shes holding

GABRIELA
Eduard

Her head against his Kafka tentatively touches her hair
and she pulls away the spell broken

GABRIELA
Your ignorance of the way things

are here is so appalling that it
makes my head spin to listen to

you and compare what you say and
have in mind with the real situation

She storms out vehemently picking up her bag on the way out
and slamming the door quakingly behind her

Kafka is too astonished at her behavior to make a move for a
moment then he glances at the bomb-case shes left behind
then he goes out to the landing

GABRIELA

Rushing down the stairs in anger tearing open the door at
the middle landing and slamming that one too once past it

KAFKA
Following her down
GABRIELA

Coming down the final flight of stairs disappearing through
the door at the bottom slamming that one as well

KAFKA

Almost caught up with her coming down to the last door
GROUND FLOOR HALLWAY

Kafka comes through the door from the stairs out of breath

and stops Hes too late The hallway is empty The front
door at the end of it is shut He makes a face and a moment

later starts to go back up Then stops again Turns Looks
back at the front door The one he didnt hear slam
OUTSIDE

The front door opens and Kafka steps out He stands on the
stoop He looks up the street one way Deserted He looks
down the street the other way Deserted

CUT
INSIDE - DAY

Kafka leads the police Inspector back along the lodging house
hallway The two subordinate policemen follow behind
INSPECTOR
You said she was extremely upset
People who are extremely upset --
Kafka -- are given to disappearing
in a hurry They go and calm down
for a day or so and then they come
back

Theyve come to the door to the stairs now

KAFKA

But thats just my point -- she was
more than upset she was livid
She slammed every door on her way
downstairs -- except that one

(points at front door)
I was just behind her and I didnt
even hear that one shut -- not at
all

INSPECTOR
Thats not what I call conclusive
evidence of an abduction

KAFKA
If someone was waiting here in the
hallway to spirit her away wouldnt
they have shut the door as quietly
as possible

The Inspector stares at him The two other policemen roll
their eyes at each other

CUT
EDUARDS ROOM

Kafka keeps his eye on the two policemen as they poke around
one of them getting close to the dumbwaiter

INSPECTOR
Why would someone want to kidnap
this woman -- the name is Rossmann

He says it rather derisively separating the syllables of the
name

KAFKA
You told me to contact you if
anything relevant came up --
Gabriela is relevant When I
spoke to you before I didnt know
shed been seeing Eduard

INSPECTOR
Thats been noted But where
does it lead us Unless you have
something more to add

KAFKA
Shes missing I went to her house
and she hadnt returned there

The policeman at the dumbwaiter peers down the shaft -- but
then moves on

INSPECTOR
She lost her job today Just
between you and me Id probably
go away and brood a bit myself

He signals his men time for them to go
STAIRWAY

The two Policemen lead the way back down the Inspector
behind them Kafka remaining on the top landing

KAFKA
(manages to blurt out)
Maybe its true then what she said

INSPECTOR
(pauses)
What did she say

KAFKA
That the police may have allegiance
to something other than truth

The two other policemen look at each other ominously The
Inspector turns to them giving them a look and they go off
down the stairs The Inspector plods back up to Kafka Like a
stern parent

They confront each other Kafka trying not to cringe too
baldly Scary shadows around the bizarrely-angled stairway

KAFKA
-- She didnt think Eduard
committed suicide
(then)
Any more than I do
(then)
She was convinced of it
Pause

INSPECTOR
Im going to say something and
I hope its quite clear because
I wont be repeating it

People treat Kafka like a child And other people seem big
to him anyway The Inspector leans his face very close

INSPECTOR
We dont have to hunt for criminals
Were drawn towards them The
guilty show us the way

He leaves Kafka alone on the top landing
CUT
CONTINENTAL COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

Kafka comes in looks around doesnt see his friends
anywhere But at the bar at his usual perch is Bizzlebek
the coffee house habituEk

BIZZLEBEK
Where are your friends

Kafka turns and looks at him

KAFKA
Good question Who are my friends
would also be of interest

CUT
TABLE

Bizzlebek sits listening to Kafkas tale of woe

KAFKA
(staring into steaming
coffee cup)
Gabriela was right -- its
easier for me to understand suicide
Im a practicing suicide

BIZZLEBEK
(slightly mocking
as ever)
-- In what sense

Kafka stares at men and women around the coffee house --
couples holding hands kissing

KAFKA
Bachelorhood is just the slow
form The bachelor doesnt sew
seeds Only the moment matters
The space he occupies grows

smaller and smaller -- until the
only space right for him is his
coffin
Pause
BIZZLEBEK

These strange stories you write --
they come naturally do they

KAFKA
Naturally -- thats not the word
I would have chosen

BIZZLEBEK
(seriously)
Where do you get your ideas
(quickly)
Only joking -- Im just joking
(laughing)

Lets go to a brothel then
Kafka come on

KAFKA
I havent got the energy I
mean I have to conserve my energy

BIZZLEBEK
Why do you work in that hideous
insurance office -- dealing with
people who fall off ladders Now
take me -- I make my living as a
stone mason Its not my art --
but its the tools of my art You
could be -- a journalist

Kafka shakes his head sadly Hes obviously heard
argument before

KAFKA
That would be even worse -- it would
be a compromise
BIZZLEBEK
Success or nothing

KAFKA
No -- not even success My writing
is not for making a living -- its

for living Not for other people
its for me

He stares at a woman who reminds him slightly of Gabriela --
a sexy woman and the man with her treating her as a sexy
woman

KAFKA

Im the exile Gabriela was
right about that too

CUT
CHARLIE CHAPLIN - EVENING

Being chased around a table by a big bearded man in
flickering black-and-white

AN AUDIENCE

Watching laughing A great sea of grinning teeth and teary
eyes

Except one Kafka sits grimly alone near the back But
suddenly hes not alone -- the Bearded Anarchist has sat down
in front of him -- and now turns round startlingly

BEARDED ANARCHIST
We have another theory

And the Pockmarked Anarchist is suddenly sitting beside him

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
We may have attached too little
importance to the reason Eduard
was summoned to the Castle to begin
with

And the Youthful Anarchist is behind him thrusting his head
suddenly forward

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
-- To correct a small discrepancy
you may recall
The Solemn Anarchist is on Kafkas other side -- but he just
watches the movie

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
-- Ah but what if it wasnt

BEARDED ANARCHIST
-- Small

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
-- What if it was a large
discrepancy

Kafkas head keeps turning around as they speak

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
Yours is a very powerful and important
firm -- it has a lot at stake

BEARDED ANARCHIST
Perhaps Eduard was closer than he
knew to discovering it and so had to
be silenced

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
-- Or he was even more an innocent
victim than that -- he was chosen to
bear the blame if the crime was
uncovered by anyone else

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
-- The crime so scandalous that the
poor young clerk committed suicide
rather than own up to it

KAFKA
Thats mad

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
-- Oh yes its mad

The Solemn Anarchist suddenly laughs -- probably at Charlie
Chaplin

KAFKA
-- You said so yourself the firm
is large and powerful If the
discrepancy really was something
big Eduards responsibility would
still have to be small No poor
young clerk could find himself in
such a fix

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
(sarcastic grunt)
When a scapegoat is needed my
friend

BEARDED ANARCHIST
We have to know what he was working
on at the time of his death

KAFKA
He worked on routine claims His
visit to the Castle was probably as
minor a mission as he said it was

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
Why are you so aggressively
unimaginative Eduard is no longer
the only casualty

KAFKA
Then why havent I been --

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
-- Kidnapped or murdered Because
your connection with Eduard was
obvious and above board -- not as
easily misconstrued

BEARDED ANARCHIST
-- Not secretive therefore not
suspicious

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
-- Gabriela on the other hand had
made an enemy of this man Burgel

KAFKA

(head turning exasperated)
Oh Burgel Gabriela was having an
affair with Eduard They were both
members of this group If any
crimes been discovered and people
are paying for it Id look to
yourselves

POCKMARKED ANARCHIST
The loyal civil servant I suppose
youll deny that shortchanging the
workers to whom compensation is due
is standard company policy
BEARDED ANARCHIST
It wouldnt surprise us if the
discrepancy was between medicines
sent and medicines received

YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST
-- People die for such discrepancies

Kafkas head is spinning -- and the Solemn Anarchist suddenly
looks at him

SOLEMN ANARCHIST
(the hoarse voice of the
restaurant bomber)
We must have a look at Eduards
file

cut
STORAGE SECTION - DAY

Kafka follows the KEEPER OF THE FILES along labyrinthine
alleys between shelves packed with files Walls are obscured
by columns of documents tied together piled on top of each
other Theres Hardly room to move Stacks of files are
everywhere balancing precariously even falling from time to
time from sheer Pressure in all directions

KEEPER
(vexed)
Raban -- thatll be nearly at
the back of the alphabet

KAFKA
It usually is

KEEPER
(snaps at him)
Im not obliged to give you access

you know -- not without authorization --
but Ill make an exception this one
time

They turn down another row walking further turning again
Kafka keeps flinching as thick bundles of documents CRASH
down around him narrowly missing him

KEEPER
(oblivious to the
danger)
Im overworked as it is
(finds the right
section)
Raban did you say

KAFKA
Yes Isnt it there
The Keeper of the Files is rifling through folders -- causing

others to fall out onto Kafka who tries to catch them

KEEPER
(pauses)
Wait a minute Raban Where

have I heard that name

KAFKA
Hes the clerk who died last week
From the insurance department

The Keeper of the files looks extremely displeased He
pushes past Kafka going back the way theyve come

KAFKA
(follows anxiously)
Whats the matter

KEEPER

Why would we keep files on dead
employees All old files are sent

up to the Castle Do you think we
have room for two hundred years worth
personnel records

KAFKA
(dodges another
paper landslide)
Its gone out so quickly

KEEPER
Whenever an employee departs shall
we say its up to the head of his
department to requisition his file
reassign any outstanding claims
and send it off

KAFKA
-- You mean my Chief has it

Documents come crashing down and we cant see Kafka and the
Keeper anymore

CUT
THE CHIEF CLERK - DAY

Looks up from his desk and sticks his chin out which is his
way of asking Kafka what the hell he wants Kafka dares to
come in

KAFKA
Excuse me sir -- I understand
you have Eduard Rabans file

CHIEF CLERK
I do

KAFKA
I wonder if I might look to see
if theres an address for family
-- I thought Id like to write
to them

The Chief Clerk has little time for such sentimentality He
gives Kafka a little exasperated look before reaching down to
-- a right hand desk drawer -- which Kafka notices -- and
taking out a folder

CHIEF CLERK
No -- just as I thought -- no
entry for family

Kafka nods a bit wondering what to do now

CHIEF CLERK
Was there something else

KAFKA
No -- I just -- I feel a sense of
obligation He was my friend --
if I can be of any help -- closing
his affairs

CHIEF CLERK
(putting file away
again)
No theres only one report to
complete Ill be doing it myself
and submitting it to the Castle
today or tomorrow

KAFKA
(as ingenuously as
possible)
I see -- its just the Erlanger

claim then
CHIEF CLERK
(looks up)
The Orlac claim

KAFKA
Sorry yes -- well -- thank you
sir

The Chief Clerk watches him as he starts to leave

CHIEF CLERK
Kafka

Kafka reluctantly turns

CHIEF CLERK
Youre too sensitive Let your
friend rest in peace
(returning to
paperwork)
Ive known suicides Such a song-
and-dance about nothing

Kafka nods once

KAFKA
Yes sir

The Chief Clerk looks at him with seemingly genuine misguided
concern

CHIEF CLERK
Give it up

He goes back to his paperwork Kafka leaves
OUTSIDE CHIEF CLERKS OFFICE
Kafka shuts the door behind him breathes a sigh of relief
CUT
THE KEEPER OF THE FILES - DAY
Looking very annoyed leading Kafka back through the stacks
KEEPER
If it was Accounts you wanted
why did you ask for Employees

KAFKA
Orlac is an account

KEEPER

Its a factory in the northern
mountains One of our best
customers

(as they disappear

around a corner)
Without a proper request Im not
obliged to do this you understand
-- but Ill make an exception on
this one occasion

ANOTHER ROW

Kafka glances nervously around as shelves CREAK threateningly
under the weight of documents Up on a ladder the Keeper of
the Files finds the Orlac folder

KEEPER
At least the account is current
even if the employee isnt

He pulls it out -- with great difficulty The Orlac file is
very very thick Kafka prepares himself to catch it but
the Keeper of the Files manages to hand it down to him
without serious injury Still its quite cumbersome and
heavier than Kafka expects

KEEPER
(coming down ladder)
That place has so many accidents
its a good thing the type of
peasants who live up there dont
seem to have any trouble propagating
their race

Kafka winces at that slur but says nothing about it
KAFKA

(leafing through pages)
All these in the last year

KEEPER
You must have read about it in the
papers -- there was a terrible

cave-in It wouldnt have been so
bad but even the Medical Officer
for the district was killed

KAFKA
I did read that They gave him
a posthumous medal

KEEPER
(nods)
Dr Murnau was the bravest of men
He spent an entire career in those
backwaters with no regard for
personal gain A great loss

KAFKA
(a particular document)
This is the cross-reference of
clerks whove worked on Orlac
claims

KEEPER

(nods)
Is your friends name among
them

(Kafka shakes his

head)
Then he only worked on the one
case

(taking file back

again)
Your Chief will send me the final
summation when hes finished with
it

KAFKA
Once a files been sent to the
Caste is it possible to recall
it for review

KEEPER
(going back up
ladder)
Of course not Only by a Director
of the firm Whod want to let in
all kinds of riff-raff off the
streets

KAFKA
What good are records if theyre
not open for public inspection

KEEPER
(stuffing file back
in place)
These laws have been with us for
centuries -- how can you doubt
them
KAFKA

What if I petitioned one of the

Directors

KEEPER

(coming back down)

You do not
summon you

summon them -- they
-- and this of course

hardly ever happens if at all
The Directors are an eccentric lot
and by nature cautious

KAFKA

Where do our records go to in the

Castle

KEEPER

(starting to walk
away)
Were a medical firm arent we

They go to
Section

the Medical Records

KAFKA

I could always apply there

KEEPER

It so happens my dear simple sir
that the Head of Medical Records at

the Castle

is one of the Directors

of this firm

Kafka scowls and follows the Keeper of the Files in silence

THE OFFICE - EVENING

Kafka works at his desk

CUT

finger tapping at an adding machine

He checks the office clock -- nearly the end of the day

THE ASSISTANTS

One is sweeping the floor The other is scribbling at their
desk His pen blotches his paper He has a fit and crumples

it up and throws it down

KAFKA

Looks over at the Chief Clerks office -- sees him writing
intently at his desk pausing to turn on a lamp
THE ASSISTANTS

The sweeping one bangs his knee against a desk and starts
hopping about The pen of the other one leaks again He
crumples up his new sheet and flings it away even more
angrily than before Then he examines his pen determines
that the cap at the back is loose and starts banging it on
his desk in an attempt to tighten it -- while the other
assistant keeps jumping around holding his hurt kneecap

KAFKA

Glances over his shoulder at them starts to say something --
but then notices Burgel not far away sometimes blocked by
other employees walking in the direction of the Chief
Clerks office

THE ASSISTANTS

The one assistant has just fixed his pen when the other one
still hopping around bumps into him causing him to knock
over a bottle of ink The two of them start shoving each
other about

Kafka whirls around cant ignore them any longer

KAFKA
Do you mind

The Assistants look at him surprised at this outburst
OSKAR

-- I was just trying to finish
some work

KAFKA
You mean youve actually begun
some

LUDWIG

(pointing at Oskar)
-- Just because hes done nothing
today he doesnt want me to show
him up

Oskar tries to lunge at Ludwig but Kafka holds him back

KAFKA
My assistants You might as well
have fallen from the sky for all
the thought that was spent in
choosing you

The Assistants look at each other sheepishly Then smile at
Kafka submissively or mockingly its hard to tell

OSKAR
Its not our fault Were
naturally nervous

LUDWIG
And were upset too

KAFKA
Whats the matter with you

OSKAR
I cant make a simple statement
without him taking issue with it

KAFKA
-- You should meet my father

LUDWIG
Weve been together too long His
personality is overflowing into
mine and vice versa

OSKAR
-- How would you like to be ina
horrible situation like that

KAFKA

He wouldnt Its the nightmare of his life

But now hes distracted again -- noticing Burgel walking away
from the Chief Clerks office (without ever having seem him
actually enter it) And Burgel is carrying a parcel under
his arm

KAFKA
(to Assistants again)
All right you might as well go
home -- go on

The Assistants do as theyre told Oskar returning to his

desk to clear up turning his back on Ludwig -- at which
Ludwig immediately rushes up very close behind him and shakes
his fist strenuously at him turning away quickly when Oskar
turns around again to try and catch Ludwig at it

Kafka isnt paying them any attention anymore He
efficiently cleans up his own space keeping an eye on the
Chief Clerks office

When the office bell RINGS the Chief Clerk immediately turns
off his desk lamp puts on his overcoat and shuts his office
light on his way out

Kafka doesnt think twice He forces himself to start
walking to the Chief Clerks office Other departing office
employees crisscross past him but he walks in a straight
line businesslike toward the Chief Clerks office He has
a piece of paper in his hand He enters the Chief Clerks
office holds the paper out to drop on the Chief Clerks desk
-- but lets it slip off onto the floor When he bends to
retrieve it he quickly opens that bottom drawer where
Eduards file was -- but its now empty

CUT
DARK STREET - EVENING
Burgel walks along adjusting the parcel under his arm
KAFKA

Following him

CUT
ACROSS THE RIVER
Burgel heads into the Old Town
KAFKA
Pauses in some shadows He glances up at the distance the

way Burgel is going up at --
THE CASTLE

Almost glowing as its outlined against the blue of the
darkening night

CUT
WHORES
Giving Kafka the eye as he goes past doorway after doorway
filled with their frighteningtempting forms But he tries
never to lose focus on the small form of Burgel further up

the street

Men milling about up and down the street prostitutes
roaming amongst them Kafka negotiating his way through An
urgent moment when he almost loses Burgel -- then sees him
turning down an alley Kafka hurries after him avoiding a
pair of drunken louts in the way

FURTHER ON

The Castle visible but still a little in the distance
Kafka comes into view He sees Burgel entering a building

CUT
UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Very dingy Burgel leaves the top of the stairs and walks
down to a room at the end

DOWNSTAIRS
Kafka waits momentarily at the bottom then goes up

HALLWAY

Peeking around the corner he sees a YOUNG GIRL embracing
Burgel in her doorway before letting him in

CUT
OUTSIDE

Kafka comes out of the building He hears a noise turns
around sees Burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony
outside her room Kafka retreats into the shadows He
watches the girl unwrap the parcel Burgels given her She
smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed

KAFKA

Watches -- with an expression of guilt sadness

Until a door suddenly opens at his back A MAN shuffles out
past him A rather ugly WOMAN in a dressing gown holds the
door open giving Kafka a cursory look Beyond her inside a
quick glimpse of MASOCHIST yelping as hes whipped

WOMAN
Well whatre you waiting for

Shes nodding him inside Kafka backs away from her and her
invitation

CUT
DIRTY YARD - NIGHT
Kafka heads for the dilapidated building or the anarchists
DINGY DOORWAY

He goes through A MOUSE scurries past him across the
threshold

THE LOPSIDED STAIRWAY
Leads him up to the attic
THE BEARDED ANARCHIST

Watches Kafkas approach But sees nothing His eyes are
wide open but lifeless

Kafka stops at the anarchists’ table Theyre all lying
around it on the floor except for the Pockmarked Anarchist
whos slumped over it her face sunk in a pool of her own
blood

The Youthful Anarchist lies on his back mouth open still
dribbling red The Solemn Anarchist seems less than solemn
due to the almost comic convoluted broken-backed position
hes in And the neck of the Bearded Anarchist is all
twisted

Kafka just stares in disbelief -- then SCRATCH -- a noise
from a spiral staircase close by leading to the roof Kafka
looks around in panic -- the attic entrance is too far to run

to and theres nowhere else to hide
THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE

A man appears from above (MR PICK) Legs draped in
expensive trousers the skirt of his high-buttoned coat
flowing around them due to the breeze from the roof

MR PICKS VOICE
-- Come on -- theres no one up
there Were going now

He raises his arm up to help down whoever it is hes talking
to We hear a strange GROAN Followed by the appearance --
unclear from the back face hidden or otherwise blocked by
Mr Pick -- of A STRANGE hunched figure He moves in a
halting cowering way Mr Pick helps him down the steps

MR PICK
Thats it -- its all right --
youve done very well

Mr Picks voice is reassuring though he has a dark
diabolic face Theyre at the bottom of the staircase now
Mr Pick leading his odd companion toward the exit The odd
companion lurches towards the dead anarchists but Mr Pick
restrains him

MR PICK
Never mind them -- theyll be
attended to
KAFKA
Pretending to be one of the dead anarchists Hiding under

the large body of the Bearded Anarchist Trying hard to
emulate his lack of movement Blood from the Bearded
Anarchists ear drips onto Kafkas face He tries to blink
it away while his other eye remains fixed on the two figures
walking away to the doorway until theyre through it and
gone

After a moment he unloads the Bearded Anarchist and softly
hurries over to the attic doorway

STAIRS

The Strange Man utters another low moan as Mr Pick leads him
like a dog down the creaking old steps

KAFKA

Comes cautiously out onto the landing He leans over the
bannister watching the two figures slowly going down the
long stairs vanishing from sight at a certain turn of the
staircase on every floor and coming into view after a moment
or so

CUT
STREET OUTSIDE
Mr Pick and the Strange One walk away
KAFKA
Follows at a respectable distance He pauses when he hears a
WAGON -- looking back at the anarchists building to see it

pulling up outside The DRIVER jumps to the ground

Kafka looks from the wagon to the two men walking away in the
distance and makes his choice -- continuing after the two
men

CUT
THE QUARRIES - NIGHT
On the outskirts of the city beyond the Castle

Mr Pick and the Strange Man approach Some distance behind
them Kafka takes cover behind a tree watching

Mr Pick leads the Strange Man down the central quarry to
where a third man a LABORER by the look of him is waiting

Kafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central
quarry He flattens himself on the ground and peers over the
edge

In the quarry Mr Pick steps back a pace from the Strange
Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the
Strange Man pinning his arms behind him baring his chest
or the Laborer to stab a dagger into

Kafka is shocked by the abruptness of this He sees the
Strange Man slump to the ground He crawls a little closer
He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his
belt then help Mr Pick drag the Strange Man off to some
side shadows where they dump him

Kafka strains forward a little trying to make out their
faces -- and the ground gives way

MR PICK AND THE LABORER
Spin around at the noise
KAFKA

Lands at the bottom of the incline dazed Hes still quite
far away from the other end of the quarry where they are

MR PICK AND THE LABORER

Look at each other once -- then go after the intruder
KAFKA
Sees them coming Scrambles to his feet It takes hima

split second to establish his options Namely the best
route is back up the way he came If only he can get up it
again as fast
Mr Pick and the Laborer start to run

Kafka starts to climb The incline is steep The gravel is
loose He slips back down

Mr Pick and the Laborer are gaining speed

Kafka digs his fingers into the dirt pulling himself up with
all his might even though his shoes dont sustain holds

Mr Pick is a better runner than the burly Laborer Hes
almost there

Kafka slips back down again Mr Pick could almost grab him
-- but Kafka literally throws himself up the slope again
gasping -- and Mr Pick stretches but cant reach that far
and Kafkas nearly at the top again -- Mr Pick climbing
after him now -- and Kafkas arm comes over the edge he
struggles over kicking gravel back down in Mr Picks face
Mr Pick slides back down to the bottom -- and Kafkas gone

The Laborer fell over Mr Pick as he came crashing back down
now Mr Pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes
another

CUT
SLOPING STREET

Escaping back into the Old Quarter Kafka runs downhill But
even the momentum doesnt carry him as fast as hed like

SMALL SQUARE

A number of streets branching off Kafka sees Mr Pick
coming down one of them -- and the Laborer coming down
another Kafka runs off along a third

CIRCUITOUS PASSAGE

Kafka runs Looks behind him Mr Pick is coming He runs
faster under a weird archway Looks behind him Mr Pick
and the Laborer are coming Kafka darts down a side street

SIDE STREET

Another twisting little road He winds around one corner
only to be met by another the end of this street impossible
to determine

BEHIND HIM
Mr Pick and the Laborer are catching up

KAFKA

Turns another corner and finds himself at the bottom of an
incredibly long flight of steps A staired street On and
on and on He doesnt know if he can make it

MR PICK AND THE LABORER

Come around -- look at the steps -- look at each other They
take deep breaths and start up

THE TOP
Here they come huffing and puffing
THE BOTTOM

Kafka comes out from behind an extravagantly designed iron
gate grillwork He sneaks away back the way he came

CUT
THE CENTRAL QUARRY

The body of the Strange Man lies face down where it was
dropped

Kafka walks toward it looking around nervously in case
anyones coming Someone is When he gets to the corpse he
hears the sound of an approaching WAGON He crouches quickly
by the body to do what hes come here to do -- turn it over
to look at --

THE FACE

Of a monster Horribly disfigured scarred and stitched

And it isnt the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or
accident There seems to be design behind it Human

design And beneath all this warped mutilated flesh almost
unrecognizable the features of the vagrant snatched from
the River

KAFKAS FACE
Revulsion He goes
THE WAGON

Parks above the quarry The evil-looking Driver jumps down
and pulls a large sack off the back He starts down into the
quarry
KAFKA

Appears over another edge He looks over at the wagon He
sees that now the back is loaded up and covered by a sheet
of tarpaulin

CUT
THE ANARCHISTS ATTIC - NIGHT

All the bodies are gone Even the floorboards and pieces of
furniture that might have had blood stains on them have been
torn away and removed Kafka stands alone

CUT
THE CITY - NIGHT
An eerie moon shines over the Castle
KAFKAS HOUSE

He comes in Before taking off his coat he finds ina
pocket Inspector Grubachs card But what can he do again
without evidence He puts the card back in the pocket

CUT
KAFKAS DESK - BEFORE DAWN

He sits writing into the night in his little room under a low
ceiling

KAFKAS VOICE
-— oh and thank you for the suit
from Father although I dont know
why he didnt simply return it If
its too small for him why do you
immediately suppose it will fit me

Your son Your loving son
Your somewhat loving son Your
occasionally loving son Your
incapable-of-loving son Your

absolutely-bored-to-death-with-any-
kind-of-family-life son

The BARKING of a DOG outside distracts him He stands up to
stretch by his open window -- and we SEE that hes wearing a
suit thats far too big for him sleeves overhanging his
skinny arms and ands trouser bottoms drowning his shoes
He looks out at the sky which is turning blue
THE BRIDGE

Two men walk across the river

A WAGON

Rolls along one of the moribund streets of the Old Town The
Driver swivels in his seat looking over his wide shoulder
as if to see if hes being followed The glint in his eye
suggests Evil

KAFKAS ROOM

Kafka puts a stamp on his letter then adds it to the stack
of obsessive correspondence already piled on one corner of
his desk

CUT
THE OFFICE - EVENING

With an ink-pad stamp Kafka POUNDS the date onto a
succession of documents

THE OFFICE CLOCK
Strikes six
THE ASSISTANTS

Jump in unison when the BELL goes off Then in their hurry
to leave start shoving all their papers and whatnots
haphazardly into various drawers opening and slamming them
regardless of whether or not the contents are fully inside
resulting in a lot of crumpled documents and snapped pencils

BURGEL
Suddenly hovering by Kafkas side handing him something

BURGEL
The Chief Clerk would like this
ready for tomorrow morning
(oily)
He says it should only take you
an extra hour or two

CUT

THE OFFICE - NIGHT
Dead silence after the daily racket of typewriters and
telephones and adding machines Kafka works alone in the
utterly deserted office building

He looks out the window and sees a POLICEMAN walking by on
the street below He thinks again about going to the law --
but goes back to work

He hears a SOUND He looks around A sort of a SCRATCHING
sound Its coming from the other end of the office
somewhere Maybe the bathroom

afka walks slowly back there At the bathroom door he
pauses momentarily then turns the handle to go inside

BATHROOM

SCRATCH SCRATCH Kafka looks for the source of the sound --
and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it -- where a
huge arm has just been thrust through a small high window --
and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for
the window-latch

afka starts backing away -- as the hand flips open the latch
-- and now the window swinging open with a bang and the
rest of the intruder starts coming into view -- out before
all of him appears Kafka has run out and slammed the door
behind him

OFFICE

afka pulls a desk across the bathroom doorway

BATHROOM
The MANIAC -- because thats what his posture and breathing
seen from the back suggest -- lurches into the bathroom from

the window

OFFICE
Kafka grabs his coat -- and an umbrella off a rack He looks
back at the bathroom -- the desk rocking back and forth as

the intruder behind the door pushes Kafka runs away
HALLWAY
He runs to the elevator sliding open the gate

OFFICE
CRASH The desk tips over as the bathroom door is forced
open

ELEVATOR

Kafka descending The elevator cranking slowly downwards
Then nearing the ground floor it slows down even further
Then it suddenly stops dead Kafka reaches for the walls to
steady himself He looks through the gate assessing the
distance to the ground floor below He tries the gate but it
wont open

KAFKA
(calls down there)
-- Help HELP

He looks around the tiny space of the elevator The roof
hatch He reaches up pushes it open starts to climb up --
and YAAHH -- the Maniacs face appears in the opening Its
another monster face -- this one even worse than the one

afka uncovered at the quarries A groaning drooling
misshapen lump of wrinkled tissue And its owners arms now
come through to stretch after Kafka

afka beats them back with the umbrella while still trying to
pull the unyielding gate open The Maniac yelps as Kafka
bashes the umbrella up at him dodging his head out of the
way each time the umbrella sweeps back at him swinging his
thick arms wildly to ward off blows and try and snatch the
umbrella for himself He finally retreats under the barrage
of blows and Kafka quickly takes the opportunity to lever
open the gate with the umbrella

The Maniacs face reappears overhead Kafka stabs the
umbrella up at him some more -- and the Maniac manages to
grab it Kafka sits down on the elevator edge to jump down
to the ground floor and --

THE MANIAC

Lunges forward from above scooping both arms down in a vain
attempt to catch Kafka just as he drops out of sight --
landing on the ground floor with a roll

The Maniac HOWLS at his failure his features even more
horribly contorted Practically filling the small opening of
the roof hatch as he SHRIEKS And as his atrocious face
comes CLOSER and CLOSER and CLOSER -- one of his eyeballs
falls out -- POP -- out of the socket suddenly -- dangling
into the elevator hanging by a single sinewy bloody thread
The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball bringing it
back up to try and stuff back in place
STREET OUTSIDE

Kafka runs away from the office building in horror off into
the night

CUT
KAFKAS STREET - NIGHT

He stands at a corner looking at his own house scared even
to go home But everything seems normal He starts walking
there But when he reaches his front door

VOICE
Did you think youd be safe back
in your little burrow

Kafka turns One of the Assistants stands next to him

OTHER VOICE
No matter how deep a hole you dig
for yourself the beast will always
find you

Kafka turns the other way The other Assistant is on his
other side Kafka looks between the two of them

OSKAR
Were to take you to the Castle

Kafka might have expected this

KAFKA
So Youre the guides up there
And we thought it was Burgel

fq

One of the Assistants draws a revolver The other chuckles
LUDWIG

They wouldnt let Burgel into

the Castle You should look upon

this as a great favor

Kafka starts walking the way a flick of the revolver
indicates the Assistants flanking him

KAFKA
I dont want any favors from
the Castle -- just my rights

LUDWIG
We answer directly to Ekman the
Senior Partner -- he practically
runs the Castle In a case like
this youre better off dealing with
the highest authority -- even
though its equally futile

OSKAR
When you speak to him you have to
lean quite near his right ear
because the left doesnt work so
well

AROUND THE CORNER
They head up in the direction of the Castle

KAFKA
For all your incompetence I was
beginning to think you were at
least loyal to me Youre very
good ham actors

OSKAR
-- Just doing our job

KAFKA
Its a farce

LUDWIG
We think youd better accept your
position instead of pointlessly
annoying us

KAFKA
What position Being prosecuted
in a case like this means having
already lost it

OSKAR
Still were probably closer to you
at the moment than any of your
fellow human beings

KAFKA
Close only by virtue of antithesis

One of the Assistants keeps making a show of wiping his brow
though its by no means hot

ANOTHER STREET
Kafka walks stiffly between the Assistants

the three of them

almost locked together as one unit like lifeless matter

KAFKA
(shaking his head)

My assistants I should have known
Nothing is given to me I have to

acquire everything

OSKAR
(laughs)

Its all right to be sarcastic in
private to us -- because we have a
sense of humor -- but when were up
at the Castle we suggest you dont
make a fuss It would spoil the
not unfavorable impression you make

in other respects

LUDWIG

Frankly we dont understand why
youve even bothered pursuing this

business

KAFKA

It would be more accurate to say

that it has pursued me

OSKAR

But your goal is so hard to reach
Do you think the official network

would surrender to one man

We

would never think of attempting
anything remotely as difficult

LUDWIG

My mother used to tell us of the
young man who decided to ride to
the next village and how she was
afraid that -- not even mentioning
accidents -- the span of a normal
happy life might fall far short of
the time needed for such a trip

Kafka suddenly points at the ground

KAFKA
Youve dropped some money

The Assistants immediately bend their heads to look -- and

Kafka bangs them together as hard as he can
The Assistants sit on the ground in a stupefied daze while
Kafkas running footsteps echo around the dark street

CUT
CONTINENTAL COFFEE HOUSE - NIGHT

Bizzlebek perched on his usual stool turns to see Kafka at
his side

KAFKA
You work in the cemetery

BIZZLEBEK
A man must eat --
(raises glass)
And drink

KAFKA
The Castle cemetery

CUT
CEMETERY - NIGHT

Ancient tombstones crumbling with age slanting out of the
ground at bizarre angles and cluttered so close together
that a way can scarcely be made between them

Bizzlebek leads Kafka along the crooked little pathways
overgrown with crawling weeds upwards towards the high
section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the Castle

Bizzlebek who knows his way around seems more cheerful here
than weve seen him before Kafka more fearful Wind
WHISTLES Leaves RUSTLE CREAKING trees cast ghastly
shadows Scary tombs all shapes and sizes strange symbolic
symbols on them mystical figures and designs

Trying to keep up with Bizzlebek Kafka spots a horrendous
shape looming ahead of him He starts to bypass it -- and
jumps when a tall plant brushes against him

BIZZLEBEK
(waits for Kafka)
Are you sure you wouldnt prefer
going through official channels

The awful dark shape turns out to be no more than a
particularly large tombstone crumbled in places to give it
an animal-like suggestion
KAFKA
Official channels -- a lot of good
theyve done me My only hope is
to approach the officials personally

He keeps walking -- and we SEE that hes carrying the bomb-
briefcase he found at Eduards

BIZZLEBEK
-- Im flattered of course to be
considered a friend -- even without

knowing all the details

(Kafka doesnt take

that cue)
-- To see such determination is
reward enough for me

KAFKA
The Kafka men are famous for it
you know Delivering meat barefoot
in the depths of winter picking up
sacks of flour with their teeth --

A BIRD rapidly swoops down from a tree zipping past Kafkas
head with a shrieking SQUAWK

KAFKA
(gulp)
-- Oh yes determination runs in
the family

BIZZLEBEK
There is one thing Id like you
to tell me

KAFKA
Im trying to find things out myself
-- thats the whole point

BIZZLEBEK
What made you think Id be able to
get you into the Castle

KAFKA

The cemetery is nearer the Castle
than anywhere else -- wasnt it part
of the Castle originally -- I
always assumed thered be a gate or
something

(stops again concerned)
Isnt there
BIZZLEBEK
In a manner of speaking

CUT
HIGHER GROUND - NIGHT

Theyre at the graves at the very back of the cemetery right
up against the bottom of the Castle wall that stretches high
above them into the black sky of night

Trees quiver around them Shadows dance Bizzlebek pauses
at a particular grave apart from the others more hidden by
overgrowth He runs his fingertips over the old strangely
lettered inscription He looks around the graveyard making
sure theyre alone then he moves to one side of the stone
and leans his weight against it pushing It shifts and
slides open uncovering the hole that lies beneath

BIZZLEBEK
I was restoring some stones here

in the upper section one day --
and I found this

KAFKA
(unclear)
An empty tomb

BIZZLEBEK
A cenotaph -- a monument to someone
whose remains ended up elsewhere

But look --

Having lit the lantern hes brought with him he holds it
over the dark hole -- revealing a shaft and the rungs of a
ladder

BIZZLEBEK
The Castle gates were blockaded
in the time of the great plague --
its an escape route
(offers Kafka the
lantern)
Dont get stuck

KAFKA
(accepts it)
Not a chance Im the thinnest
person I know

THE SHAFT
Kafka starts to climb down shoes loud on the rungs affixed
to the stone wall of this well But then he remembers
something pops back up

KAFKA
-- You appreciate my writing

BIZZLEBEK
(taken aback)
Yes

KAFKA
Will you do me a favor then

BIZZLEBEK
Another one

KAFKA
If I dont see you later -- go
to my house and find my notebooks --
and destroy them All my
manuscripts -- just burn them
Please

BIZZLEBEK
What an extraordinary request

KAFKA
Its my last and final one

BIZZLEBEK
Then its authority is in doubt

KAFKA
A true friend would do it

BIZZLEBEK
Not necessarily
(a pointed look)
A wife would

CUT
SECRET PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

A stooping Kafka makes his way along this gloomy underground
artery the lantern lighting the way

He comes to the end of it and what appears to be a little
door He bends low to listen at it -- then unlocks the
latch He pushes -- and the door moves forward
OTHER SIDE

Kafka stands up -- and hes inside a big filing cabinet
drawer

He steps out of it and looks around Hes in an entire room
full of file cabinet drawers A morgue of file cabinet
drawers He shuts the one he came out of before walking
away D-7 says the label on the outside of it

CUT
VAULTS AND CRYPTS

Kafka makes his way through the shadows down here in the
underground depths of the Castle A fiery glow and noise
comes from an archway ahead of him When he gets to it and
looks through he sees a sweating STOKER shoveling coal into a
giant furnace

CUT
NEAR THE END OF A THIN PASSAGEWAY

A sudden door SLAM Kafka dodges back around a corner He
HEARS the quick cry of a mans agony a scuffle of shoes on
hard stone floor a dull thud a wave of peculiar shouts
running footsteps more mumbled mingled voices -- which soon
die out leaving silence

AROUND THE CORNER

Kafka walks slowly straining his neck a bit in expectation
of whatever lies ahead

The passage brings him to a row of dungeon cells A line of
doors with a barred window in each One of them isnt closed
-- and lying across the threshold is the Laborer who chased
Kafka from the quarries the other night The knife is gone
from his sheath and his scull is caved in a wooden stool
lying on the floor beside him At the other end of the row
of cells another door swings open at the top of a few steps

SUDDENLY fingers spear through the bars of another cell to
touch Kafka A GAUNT MAN inside

GAUNT MAN
Youve killed him Like a dog

Kafka dropped his lantern in surprise and shrinks back
CRUNCHING glass
GAUNT MAN
-- They wont like that Not a bit

KAFKA
I didnt --

The inhabitants of the other cells start RATTLING their bars
and beseeching Kafka He looks around bewildered and
horrified Hideous faces looking back at him

GAUNT MAN
Youll incriminate the rest of us
Let me out too

Shuddering Kafka is moving away making it through the
shocking gauntlet toward the door at the other end

HORRIBLE VOICES
Help us -- release us

GAUNT MAN
(yelling above the din)
Youre in the bowels now my friend
Youve thrown yourself in it now

A HAGGARD MAN who may have had his tongue cut out gestures
desperately at a lever on the wall to unlock the cells
Kafka starts to tentatively reach for it -- when theres a
sudden SHRIEK beside him He whirls to see behind more
bars the raving convoluted face of the creature that
stalked him at his office (whose loose eye has now gone
completely) -- BANGING violently against his door

GAUNT MAN
Let me out -- Im all right -- they
havent treated me yet We can go
together

But now the evil Mr Pick appears at the end of the passage
from which Kafka came -- a gun in his hand

MR PICK
You

Kafka yanks the lever and runs away Mr Pick FIRES after
him starting to chase -- but the prisoners are coming out of
their cells -- coming for him

CUT

SPIRAL STONE STAIRWELL
Kafka runs upwards around and around and around
ANOTHER FLOOR

Here is a part of the Castle Kafka can understand -- office
workers toiling away Kafka walks past one long row of them
SCRIBES sitting at a single endless desk They look like
students under examination hunched over their writing a
virtual conveyor belt of paperwork

In the center of this floor is an actual conveyor -- a chain
pulley running slowly up and down presumably throughout the
entire Castle through small holes in the floor and ceiling
There are little pockets on the chain which the clerks
continually pluck papers out of and slip papers into

The ink bottle of one of the scribes runs dry He takes it

over to a sink with three taps -- Hot Cold -- and the third
one he turns -- Ink

CUT
CORRIDOR

Kafka passes a FRIENDLY CLERK

FRIENDLY CLERK
Are you lost

Kafka nearly laughs at the enormity of the question

KAFKA
Im uh looking for the
Medical Records Section

Pause

FRIENDLY CLERK
Oh youre miles away From here
youll want to go left left again
right right again left then right
right then left and take the Blue
Staircase

KAFKA
Thank you

FRIENDLY CLERK
(going on his way)
-- I havent seen you here before

KAFKA
No

KAFKA

He stands there a man in a suit with a briefcase in an
antiseptic corridor

KAFKA
Im new

CUT
UNDERGROUND CELLS

Mr Pick leans against a door trying to keep back the
howling horde of prisoners pushing from the other side
Another JAILER joins him helping him to try and push the
door closed Then a SECOND JAILER too A bestial hand
reaches through and Mr Pick presses his pistol muzzle into
the outstretched palm --

BANG

-- A book falls to the floor like a pistol-shot -- and
Kafka hides back in shadows hoping no one heard Hes in a
round --

LIBRARY

-- Surrounded by books from floor to ceiling even on the
tall door through which he entered A sliver of light gives
it away -- and on the other side of it he hears FOOTSTEPS
But they pass by

Theres another sliver of light indicating another door in
the books opposite him He walks over and pulls on the
shelves Here the dark wood is merely a disguising cover for
the shiny modern steel he discovers on the other side of it
And he finds more than that as he enters --

THE LABORATORY

A real mad scientists workshop Chemicals of bizarre colors
rush and FIZZ through mazes of glass pipes and beakers in
some places boiling and steaming in others frosting or
freezing Circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks
and filamentary arcs CRACKLE with electric incandescence
insane instruments and devices interconnected with complex
wires perform strange and villainous functions Its the
most modern setting weve yet seen -- but at the same time
all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic as if
put together from old familiar materials and elements both
eccentric and eclectic

The chain that runs through the floors of the Castle carrying
documents runs up and down through the laboratory too

Amidst this feast for the eyes what Kafka now focuses in on

a simple cigarette -- left smoking in an ashtray And by

the look of the ash not very long ago Kafka looks around

anxiously -- notices an archway leading to another room
CUT

UNDERGROUND CRYPT

Mr Pick and the two Jailers cant hold back the dreadful
prisoners any longer Mr Pick runs letting the Jailers
fend for themselves

CUT
LABORATORY - SMALLER ROOM

Kafka comes into what looks like a small museum -- vertical
glass cases in which naked BODIES float suspended in
preserving gelatin solution

Kafka seems deadened himself by all that hes seeing -- until
he sees someone he recognizes The Bearded Anarchist Kafka
goes closer Looking down he sees that the Bearded
Anarchist has a hand missing The other anarchists are here
in glass cases too Now with a gasp Kafka turns around --
looking for Gabriela -- but shes not here

CUT
MAIN LAB

Holding himself together and with new determination etched

on his face Kafka walks to the center of the lab -- and an
operating table Ignoring the implications of the table he
sets down the bomb-briefcase -- flicking the latches to open
it

The sight of the explosive mechanism inside causes him a
moments hesitation but a look round at various animal parts
hanging from hooks above the table or bobbing in jars
alongside sinister implements laid out in preparation for an
operation renews his anger -- and he decisively turns the
dial on the bombs timer-clock setting it to the maximum
allowance of one hour

He closes the case and locks its latches The case begins to
TICK

Kafka takes it to a dark spot beneath the mass of elaborate
laboratory equipment hides it under there and leaves

CUT
CORRIDOR
Kafka tries finding his way back the way he came
END OF CORRIDOR

Kafka looks down a long dark staircase -- a hint of light
glowing at the bottom

BOTTOM OF STAIRCASE

Just as he reaches the light something lunges at him from one
side Its the Laughing Man hysterical as ever face now
SEEN for the first time SCREECHING salivating eyes
watering The human hyena His grin contorts his face from
ear to ear his CACKLING is truly terrifying and the hand he
stretches forward has a tattoo on it (Bearded Anarchists
hand) -- a hand too big for his wrist -- reaching reaching
reaching for Kafka

CUT
DARK OFFICE - NIGHT

The Laughing Man pushes Kafka down into a chair and shakes
with uncontrollable sobbing shrieks

Someone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk
(MURNAU) His hand holds out a small vial The Laughing Man
grabs it and leaves gulping down its contents voraciously

MURNAU
I assume youre wondering what
all this has been about

Kafka tries to see into the shadows

KAFKA
Are you the Head of Medical
Records

The door behind Kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat
(EKMAN) comes in He sits in a chair and looks at Kafka

MURNAU
(to Ekman)
Hes come on his own initiative
(to Kafka)
-- Not something we encourage mind
you but we like to know it exists

And hes stood up

MURNAU
What it amounts to is simply this

Hes coming around the desk Hes drying his hands on a
towel

MURNAU
A piece of paper was delivered to
the wrong clerk It was essential
he bring it back to us These
complications have arisen because he
had friends -- like you among
others -- friends unlikely to let a
sleeping dog lie

He tosses the towel onto the desk Ekman looks irritated by
this

KAFKA
A piece of paper

MURNAU
A mere slip
(coming forward)

Your friend Mr Raban dealt only
with claims that came in another
department being responsible for
compensation that goes out -- this
is correct

He places a fatherly hand on Kafkas shoulder

MURNAU

(not quite in the

light yet)
Through a very unfortunate -- and
I might add extremely rare --
mishap a document intended for
the one department was sent to
the other And for the first
time -- though your friend
wasnt aware of it -- two and
two could have been put together
to make one
KAFKA
(again)
A piece of paper

MURNAU
(face bending into
the light)

You see Kafka in all cases
relating to the factory at

Orlac -- which is what this
paper referred to -- the
authority that puts in a

request and the authority that
grants it is to all intents

and purposes the same authority

And hes an impressive imposing figure of authority
himself Youd probably trust him Youd certainly respect
him But if you look into his eyes hes frightening

CUT
UNDERGROUND CRYPTS

Mr Pick runs from the crazed prisoners chasing him Fires
his gun back at them dropping one or two -- but then runs
out of bullets

The prisoners slowly surround him He backs away One of
those chains that run throughout the Castle has its base
here Mr Pick keeps backing up unavoidably the deranged
prisoners closing in -- until he falls backwards with a cry
into the grinding wheels of the chain-system

Caught up in the chain hes carried aloft with it up to the
ceiling The chain is the lifeline of the Castle and does
not could not ever stop Instead it forces Mr Pick to go
along with it his head CRACKING through the glass or wood
manhole cover through which the chain passes

CUT
MURNAUS OFFICE

Kafka tries not to flinch in the presence of this deadly
figure

MURNAU
-- You seem amused

KAFKA
It only amuses me in that

it gives me an insight into

the ludicrous bungling that

in some circumstances may

decide the life of a human being

Ekman sighs -- as if at a difficult child

Ekman

who doesnt hear very well

MURNAU
Its merely a matter of
expediency Its imperative
that my room to maneuver not
be hindered by bureaucratic
ramifications

particular back and forth between the other two
keeps looking at the charismatic man pacing around him --
whos now lighting an expensive cigarette of the kind that
was in the ashtray at the lab

MURNAU
-- If an obscure official up
there in the distant mountains
so far away from civilizing
influences happens to meet
with an unfortunate accident
-- and should he tragically die
in spite of the District Medical
Officers strenuous efforts to
save him -- the firm wants to
see the next of kin pacified
and the disposition of the
remains handled with the
greatest possible efficiency

KAFKA
(becoming clearer)
Accident and Compensation --
no one can accuse the firm of
not supplying exactly what it
promises

MURNAU
(to Ekman)
I believe weve exceeded his
expectations

KAFKA
(virtually to
himself)
I had the grandest of financial

directs one ear in

Kafka just
plots in mind the most
malevolent of personal motives
conspiracy theories extending
to every authority I could
see

(looks up)
And I find you A body snatcher

Murnau laughs

MURNAU
Life is more than a Chinese
puzzle my friend

CUT
FLOOR OF CLERKS

Uniformly like a chorus line the infinite row of clerks
turn their heads from their single endless desk when they
hear an awful NOISE

Mr Pick is breaking through from the floor below The
inexorably rising chain has hauled him floor by floor through
the Castle breaking open holes too small for his body
shredding him along the way and still carrying him upwards

CUT
CASTLE CORRIDOR

Kafka walks along with Murnau and Ekman The Laughing Man
holds Kafkas arm

KAFKA
And I suppose Dr Murnau didnt
die in a cave-in You killed
him to free the Position of
Orlac Medical Officer for your
own ends

MURNAU
Yes well -- were looking for
a new village now If we stay
too long at one source people

become suspicious

They pass another of those grinding chains carrying memos and
inter-office directives up and down

MURNAU
But youre quite right that

he didnt die in that cave-in
In fact he didnt die at all
He was simply recalled -- by
himself As well as being Head
of Medical Records here anda
Director of your firm -- Im
Dr Murnau of course

The Laughing Man giggles crazily

LIBRARY

The Laughing Man subdued for a moment merely smiles a
little opening the door to let Kafka in first guarding him
close Dr Murnau then leads the way across to his
laboratory door

MURNAU
May I ask where your two
warders are

KAFKA
Lying in the gutter where
they belong

Murnau laughs but then has to stop as it encourages the
Laughing Man bringing forth a mad chuckle or two from him

MURNAU
Pity Theyre an amusing pair
didnt you find Absolute
innocents

He pushes the tall door open into his lab

LABORATORY

Murnau spreads his hands proudly as they enter displaying
his amazing factory

MURNAU
I so rarely get the chance of
showing my work to anybody --
anybody capable of appreciating
it that is You might say Im
a student of human reaction

Ekman whos seen it all before goes to lean somewhere
bored

KAFKA
The fact that its live bodies
you practice your trade on
doesnt seem to matter to you

MURNAU
On the contrary it matters a
great deal Were engaged in
immensely important research
here Im a revolutionary
too you know -- but a much
more pragmatic one

As if in response to that the Laughing Man convulses anew
Ekman immediately turns to a shelf for another vial and goes
to give it to the Laughing Man

MURNAU
-- I cant very well administer
experimental treatments to

corpses -- and if they become
corpses why they have their
uses too -- thats why speed is

essential Living tissue even
if its owner has passed on is
our most valuable acquisition

The Laughing Man gulps down the potion and starts to calm
down a little

MURNAU
Weve tried transfusions on
our volunteers Unfortunately

far from infusing superior
characteristics its tended to
make them insane -- murderous
even -- a condition weve had
occasion to make use of

THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE

TICKING lightly away The clock inside the bomb-case
becoming visible as if by X-Ray is SEEN to be a matter of
minutes away from blast-off

THE LAB

Murnau walks to where the elaborate distillation processes
are going on The very section where Kafka hid the bomb
Kafka wipes his brow quickly conscious of Ekman staring at
him Murnau gazes obsessively at his contraptions his
piercing eyes following the routes of the flowing chemicals
MURNAU
-- And the new patients they
bring me arent usually as
dexterous as youve been in
evading us Not perfect
specimens by any means but
not the type of person wholl
be missed either

KAFKA
What have you done with
Gabriela Rossmann

MURNAU
As a matter of fact youve
caught us in a state of
considerable excitement Our
latest preparation we believe
-- we pray -- is perfected
It should take years off her

Hes concocting another potion now pouring an acidic-looking
liquid from one container to another Kafka is looking
increasingly worried

MURNAU
And if not -- well there are
always what I call my caprices
of vivisection

He glances at the dangling animal parts And now finished
mixing his cocktail he picks up some sort of suturing tool
pressing the trigger on it to start the end burning and
SIZZLING

MURNAU

Actually if it werent for
the aberrant dilemma posed by
someone like yourself --
continually asking for out-of-date
files -- Id probably give up my
revisionist policies altogether
Im sure what we have to do is
start instead at the very
inception -- with the embryo --
from a single cell even

(leers at Kafka)
The lure of the Golem -- the
man-made man You appreciate
that I know

Ekman takes Kafka by the arm to lead him toward the operating
table The Laughing Man moves in closer too emitting a
psychotic chortle

MURNAU
To corrupt the image of man
and then offer redemption This

is the dawn Kafka A new man is
being born here A more resilient
man A superman

Kafka attempts an escape around the operating table but the
Laughing Man blocks his way and corrals him back to where he
was before Dr Murnau holds out the sinister aperitif for
Kafka to take and drink in toast

MURNAU
To a new world -- of Gods
and monsters

The glass comes closer and closer to Kafkas lips -- if he
leans away from it any further hell be lying on the
operating table -- but now a WRENCHING noise makes everybody
turn

The body of Mr Pick bloody and ragged is dragged up with a
SMASH through a breaking floor-panel by the great chain

Kafka has his chance The next time anyone looks at him hes
holding the nozzle of the burning device under Ekmans
throat finger on the trigger

-- And on the other side of the laboratory a wide elevator
platform rises into view -- carrying the prisoners from the
dungeons

KAFKA

Throws Ekman aside and runs away

EKMAN

Falls to the floor holding his hands up over his head with a
SCREAM as the ghastly creatures from the depths converge on
him -- but they pass him by -- intent on getting Murnau

The last out of the elevator is the most horrible BEAST-MAN
yet -- and we finally see the use to which various
animal-parts have been put

MURNAU

Just stands by the operating table waiting for them He
knows theres no way out and hes far too practical a man to
waste energy running or screaming

CUT
DOORWAYS
Kafka running through the Castle through door after door
after door after door leaving them all banging behind him
back and forth

CUT
THE LABORATORY
Ekman stumbles to his feet watching in horror as the
prisoners of the Castle strap Murnau to his own operating
table
One by one the prisoners file past the intricate surgical
tools neatly laid out on white cloth Each prisoner selects
the implement of his choice
Ekman too runs away out of the laboratory
The Laughing Man snickering isnt sure whose side hes on
But then LAUGHTER BUILDING he goes to join the others in
line

CUT
DOORWAYS

Kafka still running in the maze -- through a final door And
he finds himself right back in --

THE LIBRARY

With the brightness of the laboratory facing him through its
open door Horrible SOUNDS coming from in there

THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE
Almost time

KAFKA

Running again through the maze of corridors He HEARS

running footsteps behind him -- looks back to see Ekman
running after him Ekman catches up -- but runs past Kafka
in his panic to escape -- out onto a metal walkway around a

central area of offices
THE LABORATORY

Murnau cant be seen only the deranged men huddled closely
around the operating table

THE HIDDEN BOMB-CASE
Abruptly stops ticking
THE CENTRAL OFFICES

The floors SHUDDER as the BOOM in the laboratory is heard and
felt The metal walkway breaks and Ekman goes sliding off it
-- while Kafka manages to hang on He ducks his face down as
glass from all the surrounding office windows SHATTERS and
SHOWERS -- and then paper starts sailing down all around
Literally a hailstorm of documents

On the floor below where he fell Ekman tries to stand but
the falling flurry of paper keeps him at bay He waves his
hands wildly trying to see his way through it all but its
too much Now his feet are trapped in it Its starting to
rise around his legs Papers are fluttering down from floors
and floors of surrounding offices above filling the air

Ekman suffocates and drowns and disappears in the paper
piling up around him -- one lone arm and hand the last we see
of him

THE LABORATORY

Totally wrecked -- and jutting out of the broken walls are
burst pipes -- spurting red blue and black INK everywhere

THE CENTRAL OFFICES

Kafka is managing to climb back onto the unsafe metal walkway
-- when ZING -- a bullet ricochets near him

The Assistants Theyve nearly fallen through another
doorway where the walkway on that side broke but got each
other stuck in the door just in time One of them is wildly
FIRING a revolver in Kafkas direction The other tries to
grab it and both FIRE it together in all directions

Kafka runs away avoiding a snake of broken wire flipping
about SPARKING off the metal

The Assistants shoving each other extricate themselves back
through their doorway to find another way to chase Kafka
THE LABORATORY

The burst ink pipes drip empty The sound of maniacal
LAUGHTER abruptly stops The ink has filled the lab halfway
to the ceiling Its covered everything and every body
A last bubble pops leaving a lake of ink with a surface
smooth as glass

CUT
UNDERGROUND FILE VAULT

Kafka has found his way back here -- rushing in But wait
Which file cabinet did he come out of Hes surrounded by
file cabinet drawers all alike He starts running around
pulling open drawers trying to find the secret doorway
through one of them

SPIRAL STONE STAIRCASE
Here come the Assistants running round and round
UNDERGROUND FILE VAULT

Kafka runs round and round opening drawer after drawer He
finds the one Jumps in Pulling it closed after him just
as --

-- the Assistants stumble in They look at each other then
immediately start rushing around opening drawers They run
back and forth and all around bumping into each other
making themselves dizzy

They start trading files back and forth trying to put the
system back in order The attention span of squirrels
theyve forgotten all about looking for Kafka

CASTLE GATES - DAWN

Opening The police Inspector enters the main courtyard
Behind him come the two secondary policemen Behind them

EMBANKMENT - MORNING
On the Old Town side of the River Foggy
KAFKA

Walks slowly tiredly He looks up at the sky but the sky
is a silver shield against anyone who looks for help from it

FURTHER ON

Kafka stops Turns Did he hear something other than the
wind and the water

FURTHER ON

He passes through a small park approaching a gate on the
other side of it Leaves RUSTLING Mist swirling around
him He opens the gate and -- Boo

GABRIELA

Standing there half in shadow in profile Her glorious
profile

KAFKA
Gabriela -- you did get away

GABRIELA

I knew you walked this way to
work I wanted to find you
before they did

KAFKA
-- Ive just come from the
Castle Its over

GABRIELA

(her eye glancing

far away)
Over Its only over when
you can crawl to a clean little
spot on earth where the sun
sometimes shines and you can warm
yourself a bit

Kafka is beginning to sense something quite wrong with her

KAFKA
Gabriela

GABRIELA
hould I tell you why I joined
ur late lamented nihilists
hy I became a murderer
ecause murder is bliss

Its easier than you might
think to absorb and assimilate
Evil -- once youve adopted its

WwSaon

rocedure

Kafka just watches her The breeze sings in
the air

GABRIELA
Have you ever watched a person
deteriorate Day by day I
dont mean in a spiritual sense

Kafka doesnt answer She turns fully to him The other
side of her beautiful face is fungus Alive Seething
Frothing Bubbling Kafka backs away a couple of steps

GABRIELA
Only two steps back Even the
man they left to guard me
retreated further than that

KAFKA
I -- I found your jailer

GABRIELA
This is the result of their
elixir of youth They were
to come and check on it during
the night I contrived to
miss the appointment

KAFKA
Theyre dead now We can
get help

GABRIELA

I know how they reward failure

If they saw this Id be rotting

in the quarries by the afternoon
-- with all the others

KAFKA
Theres a new potion -- he
said it was perfected

GABRIELA
I know there is And youre
what I have to bargain with
For now youre the last one
in their way

KAFKA
I told you theyre dead Its
finished

GABRIELA

Why should I believe a man who
never believed me Theyre
absolutely right you know --
guilt should never be doubted
Its easier that way

Kafka starts to back away some more Gabriela starts to
follow him

GABRIELA
I think youve just escaped for
the moment Just as I did As
Eduard did As they let us do
But only for the moment

KAFKA
No -- not this time

GABRIELA
I know better than you what
people will say when they have
to When they brought me in
for questioning I informed on my
friends the very first day

KAFKA
-- Listen to me --

GABRIELA

I do Always You understand
the world better than any of
us Kafka And what its
becoming

(pause)
Ive always held you in the
highest regard

And suddenly shes slashed a knife across Kafkas chest He
shouts in pain staggering backwards She comes after him

KAFKA
-- Gabriela

She comes after him blade glistening Kafka does his best
to run

THE BRIDGE

Kafka giddily staggers forward one arm wrapped around his
bleeding chest Gabriela close behind him Too close for him
to get away He turns to face her as he reaches the bridge
and as she comes upon him again with the knife raising his
arm to block the thrust and hold her wrist back Shes
strong though made more so by her madness She forces him
down to the ground straddling him the knife pushing

closer Kafka gasps in pain finally succumbs no longer
able to hold his hand up in defense simply shutting his eyes
with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab

It doesnt come Almost But not quite Gabrielas arm
pauses shaking in the cool cloudy air her sleeve trembling
in the breeze off the River the sharp blade inches from
afkas throat flashing in the new days light

Gabriela stares away over the River the destroyed half of
her face in shadow again the other more strikingly beautiful
than ever As Kafka watches passive she gets off him and
slowly walks to the wall of the bridge letting the knife
drop from her hand along the way Kafka manages to lift
himself to his knees clutching his wound He looks up
Gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and
throws herself into the River

afka lowers his head
CUT
CONTINENTAL COFFEE SHOP - MORNING

Quiet in here Breakfast business not as crowded as

evening Kafka sits alone at his usual table Looking
dazed almost in shock Mostly just tired Waiting He
sips from his coffee cup He COUGHS a little into his napkin
-- and notices blood on it

He has a pen in his hand Tapping it slowly on a newspaper
on the table

Bizzlebek comes into the coffee house He sees Kafka sitting

in the far corner and gives a grand smile and wave But then
he notices Kafkas other friends entering and hed rather not
have to deal with them -- so he gives Kafka a catch you

later gesture and turns onto his own usual stool at the bar

Kafka stares at his friends over there Theyre taking off
their coats and greeting other people The girl Anna is
the first to start walking to join him

He starts to write a first line that has occurred to him
the pen moving as if he cant help himself

KAFKAS VOICE
Dearest Father

Annas approaching Kafka just watches her coming He
knows hell end up going out with her sleeping with her
getting engaged to her We see the future on Kafkas
face

KAFKAS VOICE
You asked me recently why I
maintain that I am afraid
of you

CUT

KAFKAS HOUSE - NIGHT

Alone again in his little room Kafka writes on into the
night The famous Letter To His Father is pages and pages
long We notice too that his chest has been bandaged He
COUGHS a little as he forces himself to keep writing

KAFKAS VOICE
Naturally things cannot in
reality fit together the way
the evidence does in my letter
-- life is more than a Chinese
puzzle But in my opinion
something has been achieved
which so closely approximates
the truth that it might reassure
us both a little and make our
living and our dying easier

FADE OUT
FADE IN
WATERFRONT WHARVES - MORNING

The Assistants sit on a big packing crate brushing soot from
their suits shaking dust out of their hair fiddling with
the rips in their jackets and trousers

LUDWIG
We could go back to the office
Explain ourselves to the Chief
Clerk

OSKAR
Theyd drive us away That
Kafkas made things very hot
for us

LUDWIG
I understand he was wounded
in the lung

OSKAR
(sulky)
It doesnt matter Its too
late for all of us

LUDWIG
(looks at O)
Whats to become of us now

Oskar has a long think

OSKAR
(looks at L)
Amerika Thats the place to go

Ludwig jumps off the box and gapes at Oskar tremendously
impressed by this brainstorm

LUDWIG
Everyone in Amerika has a
toaster in their building
Oskar jumps down from the box

OSKAR
Then thats the place for us

LUDWIG
Amerika for us

OSKAR
Amerika

And linking arms they do a strange dance along the

quay
