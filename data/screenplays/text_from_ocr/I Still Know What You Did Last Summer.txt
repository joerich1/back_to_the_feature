The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images
Holy

images of STAINED GLASS and lead

FOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor

REVEAL - JULIE JAMES

A little older a little wiser yet still very pretty no doubt

But
shes all alone in the house of the Lord

And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy
burden
still rests upon her soul

She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a
curtained

CONFESSIONAL BOOTH

2 INT CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY

Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters kneeling
before

the CLOSED SCREEN A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN

A PRIEST

name was Ben Willis

The confession is cathartic for Julie She looks relieved until

PRIEST

body

JULIE

Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition Julie moves closer
to
the screen trying to get a better look
