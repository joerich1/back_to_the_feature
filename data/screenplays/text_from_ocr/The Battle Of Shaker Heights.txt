FADE IN

EXT FOREST - DAY

DISTANT GUN AND MORTAR FIRE

Muffled by the wet green forest

The very earth seems to tremble

A RABBIT

Darts out of a log lifts itself on its hind legs and
the air

LOBBED GRENADE EXPLODES

VOICES and SHOUTS closer now mix with the rumbling

SOUNDS in a veritable symphony of violence and

A DEAD AMERICAN GI lays splayed out careless in death
A pair of SOLDIERS flash among the trees running

over and low and disappear into the gray blooms of

For a moment the forest takes a breath
Nothing but trembling leaves Then - The RATTLE of a

Coming closer in fits and starts GRINDING through low

A Willys MB appears CRASHING through the undergrowth
Its driven by Private First Class KELLY ERNSWILER

Eighteen if that Not much meat on him His insignias
standard-

Be

maneuvering

and

wipes his

lever

falls

on

against

indicate hes in the 29th Infantry

His face might be attractive under other conditions
He pauses and pulls a map from the pocket of his M41
issue field jacket

KELLY
Where the hell are those Krauts

To give himself courage he SINGS Tommy Dorseys Ill
Seeing You in all the old familiar places while

the Jeep through the bushes and rocks

He drives straight for a fallen LOG GUNS the engine
tries to go over it

The Jeeps FRONT WHEELS catch on the log

The BACK TIRES spin

Kelly gets out Takes off his Ml combat helmet and
face Assesses the situation

He grabs a BRANCH Jams it under the wheel trying to

the Jeep free When --

The STUTTER of a nearby MACHINE GUN startles him

The branch SNAPS against Kellys weight He slips and
in the mud

KELLY
Shit

Determined he grabs his pack and carbine and sets off
foot through the forest

EXT CLEARING

Kelly strides purposefully out of the woods Pauses

a split-rail fence beneath the innocent sun
around

away to

Their

belt

the

see

but

himself

Across the clearing stands a seemingly abandoned BARN
But not for long as TWO GERMAN INFANTRYMEN appear
the corner of it

Kelly moves behind a tree to assess the situation
Unaware the Germans smoke and talk Kellys too far
hear them but he watches their every move

Theyre relaxed not as on guard as they should be
Karabiners rest slung across their backs

KELLY
Bingo

AGAINST THE TREE
Kelly focuses himself
Then he shoulders his carbine
Pulls out his dog tags and kisses them grimly
KELLY

And so they buried Hector breaker

of horses
He takes his Smith and Wesson 1917 PISTOL from his pistol
and steps out into the SUNLIGHT FIELD in plain sight of
guards
Surely he knows they can see him He must want them to
him
But they dont Too busy passing nudie wallet photos
Halfway across the open grass Kelly raises the pistol
does not aim it

Just strides steadily closer arms spread out making

an easy target
get

into

young

pushes

Crazy as it seems Private Kelly Ernswiler is trying to
himself killed
EXT BARN
Kelly pauses not twenty feet from the Germans FIRES
the air and waves --
-- when from behind him comes a voice
GERMAN OFFICER
(OS)
Eine maus findet den kase
Kelly whips around to face a third German the OFFICER
His pistol points right into the Officers shocked pink
face Point blank range
Only - Kelly doesnt fire
He just lowers the pistol
The German smiles

KELLY
Kill me Adolf

GERMAN OFFICER
Mien Prisoner

The Infantrymen have recovered from their idle and come
running

One of them yanks Kellys hands behind his back and
him into the barn roughly
Kelly doesnt struggle
KELLY
Hey Siegfreid and Roy What are you
waiting for Kill me

INT BARN

Kelly sits slumped in a chair legs tied up One of the
Germans shines a flashlight in his face Kelly squints
KELLY
Come on you pussies Lets get this
over with

The German Officer produces a piece of paper anda
fountain
pen

GERMAN OFFICER
(German accent)
You will write your mother Tell her
how you will die now

Kelly takes the pen and examines it

KELLY
Genuine Third Reich issue no less
Nice work

The Officer pokes the paper

GERMAN OFFICER
You will write How you die alone

KELLY
My mother and I dont have that kind
of relationship

GERMAN OFFICER
(hisses)
Write

Kelly thinks about it for a minute - should he or
shouldnt

he - but sighs and begins writing After a few lines
the

Officer snatches the paper away and passes it to an

Infantryman

GERMAN OFFICER
Enough Now you will beg for your
life

KELLY
What dont you understand

INFANTRYMAN
(interrupts sheepishly
in German accent)
The protocol says we should -
seems

in

talking

rifle

exaggerated

The Officer wheels around and scowls at the speaker

to be getting a bit hysterical

GERMAN OFFICER
I am the fucking protocol
(to Kelly)
Beg
He and Kelly glare at each other
The Officer FIRES his Luger into the rafters

GERMAN OFFICER
Beg - for - your - life

KELLY
You got to be kidding me

The Officer grabs his throat

GERMAN OFFICER
Silence Now I have a little fun

He

Kelly laughs The officer slaps him Kelly jerks away

KELLY
Now thats against the rules

GERMAN OFFICER
(sneers)
There are no rules in war

Suddenly another AMERICAN GI appears behind the German

the shadows

Only Kelly can see him The GI motions to Kelly keep

while he gets into a better position with his M-1

KELLY
(to Officer)
Youve never killed anyone before
have you

GERMAN OFFICER

I shower in the blood of my victims --

The GI shoots the two infantrymen who fall in
pain and commence death throes

Quick as a flash the GIs Colt 1911 PISTOL is at the
German
Officers neck his M-1 in his other hand

GI
No wonder you smell so bad

GERMAN OFFICER
Dont shoot please

The GIs eyes widen He looks at Kelly

GI
Will you look at the manners on this
guy
(to German)
Remember to thank me when I kill
you

GERMAN OFFICER
No really not in the neck -

But the GI does anyway
The Officer SHRIEKS grabs at his neck and falls

GI
(to Kelly)
You all right

KELLY
Yeah My elaborate death scene wasnt
going anywhere anyway

GI
You want me to give you a minute

KELLY
Thats okay Theyll get me
eventually If you cant get killed
in a war when can you

GI
Thats right Look on the bright
side

The GI holds out his hand

guy

About his own age but BART takes up more space

KELLY

KELLY

Bart
BART

GERMAN OFFICER

(from the floor now

with a decidedly

American accent)
Wow man this is a really beautiful
scene and all but I have to
interrupt

(to Bart)
Why the fuck did you have to shoot
that cap so close to my neck You
gave me a powder burn

KELLY
Listen you wienerschnitzel You should
talk You slapped me Im not your
bitch

The Officer gets up and dusts off his uniform

GERMAN OFFICER
Well what was that whole creepy
death wish thing about

KELLY
Well it didnt work now did it

GERMAN OFFICER
(shrugs)
Sometimes I get so caught up in the
moment

KELLY
And what was that ridiculous shit
about making me write to my mother
The Officer grins

GERMAN OFFICER
Inspired wasnt it

BART
Dude you made him write to his
mother Who are you Dr Phil

INFANTRYMAN
(also with American
accent)
Can we get up now

Bart helps him up and checks his regulation-issue
Timex

BART
Might as well Theres only an hour
left anyway

The German Officer crosses his arms

GERMAN OFFICER
(to Kelly)
Admit it You were scared

KELLY
(snorts)
Right

Kelly gets up from the chair and falls over His legs
are
still tied

EXT FOREST

The DEAD GI gets up and walks off with the GERMANS and
some
other SOLDIERS done for the day

Bart unfolds an entrenching tool from his belt and digs
the back wheels building up dirt
Then he goes around to the front and puts his shoulder

the hood Bart rocks the Jeep while Kelly pumps the

The Jeep finally pulls free and SPRAYS Bart with mud

KELLY

Kelly looks over his shoulder and starts backing away

KELLY

Bart stands there dripping with mud shocked
About a hundred feet away Kelly stops

KELLY

Bart walks towards the Jeep Kelly backs it up again

KELLY

Bart and Kelly sit in a booth together Bart has an
confident manner and expansive gestures Kelly eats
over like someone might try and steal his food

BART
Character building Those crazy guys
from Ann Arbor tied them to a dock

KELLY

Bart throws his napkin on his plate

EXT BOWLAND HOUSE - DAY

Kelly pulls up into the circular gravel drive Barts

house
is fancy A nice yard and a pool Bart hops out
BART
You should come over some time
Service our lawnmower
KELLY
I would but then I might soil my
croquet whites You understand
BART
How bourgeois Cheerio then
Kelly watches Bart go into his house and smiles in
spite of
himself
EXT ERNSWILER HOUSE - DUSK
Kellys house is a also pretty nice nothing to be
ashamed
of It is smaller and weirder The flowers and bushes

at precarious angles

INT ERNSWILER HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
Kelly walks in on his dad ABE making sandwiches A
pile of cheese and PBéJ
ABE
Sergeant Keller How was the war
Did we win
Kelly doesnt smile at this He looks at the sandwiches
puts his finger to his chin in a gesture so facetious
downright angry
KELLY
Let me guess Happy Meals for the
wavy gravy wellness center
Abe grabs two pieces of bread from a loaf He looks
bit ill-used by life The phrase rode hard and put

wet comes to mind

ABE
As usual your cynicism is refreshing

He finishes that sandwich and adds it to the pile

Kelly pauses while opening the refrigerator His back
tightens He slams the door with his foot

KELLY
As usual your cheerful optimism
makes me ill

Abe pauses over a slice of bread only briefly The

is nothing new

Kelly walks through the kitchen and out the back door

KELLY

Kelly opens the screen door and pokes his head in

A family of Chinese immigrants the Lings paints
at long worktables Theres a MOTHER father MAO
XIOU-XIOU SON and DAUGHTER

Finished canvases hang from the walls and lean in
against it All of them are portraits of animals

on hats or clothes
Kellys mom EVE shows grandmother XIOU-XIOU a few
with a paintbrush

Eve wears jeans Shes one of those young-looking

piles
Some

Kellys friends would have crushes on If he had any

MAO
(to Kelly)
Son of Eve You are very dirty

KELLY
(awkward)
A rough charge You know

EVE
(to Kelly)
Dont touch anything We have to get
ready for the Starving Artist show
(to Xiou-Xiou)
Now Nana the gold has to be feathery
not gloppy - see

Eve demonstrates on the painting - a pair of monkeys in

court dress Kelly looks over his moms shoulder
EVE
Now you try

Grandmother Xiou-Xiou dabs at the painting

EVE
(to Kelly)
She loves the gold Always overuses
it And usually her touch is so light

XIOU-XIOU
Gold is the color of the sun

Eve moves along the row stopping to look at the
paintings
in progress

KELLY
You know why we never have anything
to eat in this house

But Eve has stopped behind Maos painting Shes not
paying
attention to Kelly

EVE
Mao what did we say about the eyes

She gestures at the image of a horse done Santa Fe
style
lots of pastels very abstract

Mao looks at her quizzically

MAO
More - empathy

EVE
Thats right And didnt I tell you
to put in more cacti

MAO
(shakes head)
No no more cacti Too busy
Simplicity is best

His family nods in support of this rash aesthetic
statement

Eve rolls her eyes
EVE
Oh boy Im not having this battle
with you again

Kelly breaks in

KELLY
Because your husband takes food from
his own family to feed every loser
druggie in Cleveland

Eve moves down the line
EVE
Well you can always chip in here

Were ordering pizza later

At this the family nods and smiles to each other

pleased
with the news
KELLY
No Some people have to work later
(casual)
Will you drop something off at the
dry cleaners for me tomorrow
Eve looks up at him for the first time Takes in his
filthy

uniform

EVE
Sweetie you know what we said about
paying for the war things Nothings

changed

KELLY
Its the only thing I ever ask you
for --

EVE

Dont be dramatic

KELLY
But its important to me

Eve stops at Mother Lings painting

EVE
Youre just going to have to find a
way to pay for it yourself then I
guess

Kelly leaves Eves busy talking

EVE
More brown less blue

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT
Kelly comes back in a grabs a sandwich off the pile
ABE
Now Keller who needs that sandwich

addict trying to make a new life
Kelly looks at him and bites into the sandwich
KELLY
How about the son of a heroin addict
trying to get ready for work
Kelly leaves with the sandwich Abe sighs and picks up

bread

ABE
That went well

He sits on the edge of the bed for a minute staring

space before he peels off his muddy uniform piece by

INT GROCERY STORE - NIGHT
Ah the graveyard shift Musak Steely Dan
Kelly unpacks cat food
Thousands and thousands of little cans of it Its hard
keep the rows straight on the shelves
SARAH the night cashier stands at her register Shes
looking now but shell be beautiful later when she
out who she is
Not another soul in the store Sarah wanders over to
aisle as if pulled by a magnet
SARAH

So howd your battle go today I

still dont understand how you could

reenact the Battle of the Bulge in

seventy-two degree weather

(plays with hair)

Didnt all those guys freeze to death

Kelly doesnt stop working Hes got a system
KELLY
Well a Port-a-John fell over ona

couple of guys

SARAH
Thats gross

KELLY
War is hell

Kelly grabs another handful of cans

SARAH
Then why do you do it

Kelly pauses He puts two cans on the shelf very
KELLY
Youre never more alive then when
facing simulated death

SARAH
Really Maybe I should try it

Kelly looks at her thinks about this and stands up

KELLY

You are William J Stone of the lst
Airborne pinned down in Noville
The Germans have the high ground and
theyre shelling your position
heavily

(starts throwing cans)
Youre holed up in a stone barn
Sustaining heavy casualties Running
low on ammo The cries of wounded
men fill the air like the cries of
hungry babies

Sarah covers her head huddled behind the boxes of cat
food
dodging cans

KELLY
Your commanding officer gets hit in
the face dies At 1 pm you lose
radio contact with headquarters If
you withdraw the Germans will flank
the entire Allied forces arrayed
along Bastogne and break the front
What do you do What do you do

SARAH
Stop it

Kelly goes back to stocking satisfied

KELLY
Battle of Bulge the Southern
Shoulder December 44

SARAH
Sorry I asked

Sarah stands up and starts to wander away but Kelly
makes a
peace offering
KELLY
Hey Want a snack We got a whole
shipment in of busted Oreos

Sarah looks at her feet considering whether or not to

accept
it

SARAH
Ill accidentally drop a couple pints
of milk and meet you over there

INT DAIRY BACKROOM

Sarah and Kelly sit on milk crates pass the cookies
back
and forth and get philosophical

SARAH
The frozen food woman came in with
her kids They must eat out of those
little cardboard trays every night
One of the kids looked like cardboard

KELLY
Do you know we stock more flavors of
cat food than we do baby food

SARAH
No

KELLY
Sixteen flavors of baby food including
the toddler meals-in-ajar thirty-
one flavors of cat food

He fishes for a cookie

KELLY
Next time you should tell that woman
to buy her kid some cat food

An ANGRY WOMAN pushes open the swinging door of the
backroom
with her loaded shopping cart

WOMAN
Is this store open Ive been waiting
up front If the stores closed it
shouldnt have a sign that says twenty-
four hours
slung

he

locker

LANCE --

Sarah gets up Kelly stays right where he is finishing
cookie

SARAH
Sorry about that

WOMAN
I have a lot of coupons and I dont
want to be here when they expire
KELLY
(to Sarah)
Charge her double for everything
Sarah smiles and hurries away
INT SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY
Kelly walks down the hall with his army-issue BACKPACK
over one shoulder Besides a serious case of bedhead

looks normal

No one says hi to him as he makes his way to his

As he twirls the combination and opens it he notices
short and wide built like a tank prematurely balding
his girlfriend BRIDGET embracing a few lockers down
They kiss raunchily their tongues darting in and out
each others mouths
Lance sees Kelly looking and stops kissing
LANCE
What the fuck are you looking at GI
Jane
Kelly shakes his head and gets a book out of his
LANCE
No really what makes you think you

can look at me

KELLY
I honestly didnt know it was you I
thought it was a free preview of the
Spice Channel
LANCE

Thats pretty funny You got dental
insurance

Kelly closes his locker and walks away

Bridget wipes her mouth guiltily

Lance shakes his head and pulls Bridget to him

grinding his

pelvis against hers

BRIDGET
Stop it

She walks away

LANCE
What What

INT CLASSROOM -- DAY
The lights are off in history class

The teacher MR NORMAN shows slides on the Civil War

The

more we see the clearer it becomes that they are his
own

photos from a vacation spent visiting the memorials

Mr Norman smiles out at his class in shot after shot

He clicks the remote and a photo of his WIFE crouched
over

and wearing shorts drinking from a garden hose appears
on

screen

MR NORMAN
Whoops

He hurries through to the next slide

It doesnt matter anyway Everyone is almost asleep

Except Kelly who becomes increasingly irritated the
more

Mr Norman talks
MR NORMAN
And here at Gettysburg the ranks
of Union soldiers fought bravely on
They were willing to give their lives
so that others might be free

Kelly shifts in his seat

MR NORMAN
Is there a problem Mr Ernswiler

KELLY
No

But Mr Norman doesnt start talking again

He waits looking at Kelly smiling blandly Until the
silence
becomes uncomfortable And Kelly gets mad

KELLY

Come on Isnt this analysis a tad
simplistic I mean maybe for a second
grade history class sure - but to
insist on still characterizing the
Civil War as some moral struggle
The soldiers were drafted - the only
ones who had to fight were the ones
who couldnt afford to pay their way
out

(losing it)
Why dont you talk about the Draft
Riots Where are your slides for
that

INT PRINCIPALS OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Fresh flowers and a crocheted tissue box hoodie make
the
place cozy

Kelly sits across the desk from PRINCIPAL HOLMSTEAD a
well-
groomed woman with a gentle talk show host demeanor

HOLMSTEAD
What gives you the idea that you can
or ought to question the curriculum

Kelly doesnt move Hes not into this
HOLMSTEAD
Or question your teacher

KELLY
I know I mean who ever heard of a
classroom dialog Not Socrates

Ms Holmstead is exasperated but she likes him in
spite of

herself Hes a smart cookie Shes got to change her

strategy

She leans back in her chair

HOLMSTEAD
Kelly youre a very bright boy But
youre making some serious mistakes

KELLY
I dont need to Everyone else makes
them for me

Her chair SQUEAKS as she leans forward and looks at
Kelly
intently

HOLMSTEAD
This anger must be masking a lot of
hurt

KELLY
I was wondering what the tissues
were for

Holmstead tries again She looks down at his file

HOLMSTEAD
I see youre not going to college
next year What are your plans

Kelly shrugs Holmstead searches his face for any
clues

HOLMSTEAD
How do I get through to you

KELLY
Advertisers use status and sex to
appeal to my demographic

She shakes her head and swings her chair towards the
window
and gazes out at the front walkway of the school Her
face
clears Somethings clicked

HOLMSTEAD
I think we can come up with a
punishment which might actually be
more of an opportunity for you to
realize your true potential

EXT SHAKER HEIGHTS HIGH - DAY

Lance walks away towards his car Kelly runs after him
Lance holds Kelly off easily with one hand and throws
backpack into his SUV They STRUGGLE for a minute

TABBY

KELLY
I dont really feel comfortable

In spite of herself Tabby laughs at this This gives
Kelly
more confidence He leans over the aisle to see what
shes
looking at
KELLY
Youre working with acrylic Why
Oils much - richer
TABBY
Oh youre not one of those oil snobs

Does it mess up your concentration
Me being here

TABBY
No

She turns back to her painting

KELLY
Oh Thats good

Kelly sets up his canvas

TABBY
Just dont talk

KELLY
Why would I

TABBY
(pause)
Im kidding

KELLY
Right Irony I like that

Kelly feels the tubes of paint Nervous Squirts some
color
out Looks over his shoulder at her

Hes trying to get his act together to be cool about
being

there in the studio alone with her Trying to figure
out

how to play it

MINER
(OS)
Hey Hey babe

Miner opens the door See Kelly Smiles like the
stockbroker
he is and crosses to him

MINER
Miner Webber

Miner holds out his hand for a good old-fashioned
shake

Kelly takes it

KELLY
Webber Miner

Miner looks confused

TABBY
Kelly This is Kelly -

KELLY
Kelly Ernswiler Sorry I -

MINER
Quite all right
(smiles as an
afterthought)
So what do we have here a little
painting class

TABBY
Kellys a friend of Barts He paints

MINER
Oh Whats your real job

Kelly smiles eagerly at Miner over the edge of his
canvas

KELLY
That would be stock boy at the Shop
Rite But as President Don Kaminsky
says every employee is part owner
So you could say Im a captain-of-
industry in training Kind of
capitalist larva

MINER
Thats quite an image
KELLY
Only if you see the most magical
part Do you see

MINER
What

Kelly spreads his arms out and flaps them a little

KELLY
One day Ill be a beautiful butterfly
First Ill have to be a pupa though
I figure I wont be going out much
then Pupa the awkward adolescence
of the insect world

Miner stares at Kelly He cant tell what he might be

making
fun of or if it might be him
MINER
Whatever it takes to get you through
the day
Kelly rolls his eyes at this uninspired response
though
Miner doesnt see it He grabs Tabbys paintbrush and
pulls
her to him
MINER
I have the afternoon off Come away
with me
TABBY
Im not at a good stopping point
MINER
Oh come on Theyll still be here
(to Kelly)
I know youll still be here
Kelly smiles his most idiotic energetic smile and slaps
paint

on his canvas in exaggerated strokes

TABBY
I really shouldnt

MINER
But everyone will be coming soon
And it will get all crazy and we
wont have any time to ourselves

TABBY
We will I promise

Tabby kisses Miner He realizes theres no convincing
her

and sighs

MINER
Like tonight We can practice
honeymoon suite

TABBY
Maybe Probably

Miner looks at Kelly who looks away
Then he puts his hands in his pockets and leaves

Tabby and Kelly paint in silence for a while Kelly
moves

around to look at his canvas from different angles
like

hes copying what he thinks a painter would do

KELLY
Is he always like that

TABBY
Like what

KELLY
Overbearing

Tabby stops and puts down her brush

TABBY
Just because he didnt want to picture
you as a pupa

KELLY
Oh he will - later When hes alone
Whether he wants to or not

Kelly paints
KELLY

Not that though How he wanted you
to stop
has a

TABBY
He wants to be with me Whats so
bad about that

KELLY
Just because some one wants to be
with you doesnt mean theyre good
for you

Kelly is suddenly very involved with his painting He
hard time making eye contact with Tabby

KELLY
No one should ever ask you to stop
If you stop you might not be able
to start again Or you might start
again only things will be different

TABBY
Well thats sweet -

KELLY
Its not sweet actually Its just
the truth

TABBY

Hey I can take care of myself
She picks up her brush

KELLY
Whens the wedding

TABBY
At the end of the month But dont
ask me about it It makes me nervous

Kelly looks at her seriously

KELLY
Why Is something wrong

TABBY
No

Awkward silence

TABBY
What are you painting

Kelly stops and sighs now back in serious artist mode
KELLY
Really there are so many layers of
- imagistic symbolism - that I really
dont feel comfortable summing it
up but well - its a recurring
dream image A mermaid riding a rocket
ship

Tabby stops painting

TABBY
How

KELLY
What do you mean how Sidesaddle
Shes riding it sidesaddle Shes
got a fish tail for chrissake I
havent decided yet if shes got
scuba gear on or not

TABBY
Do you have any idea what youre
talking about

Kelly puts up his thumb in an approximation of an
artists
gesture

KELLY
Does that matter

TABBY
Well some people actually say what
they really think

KELLY
What if they dont know what they
really think

TABBY
It doesnt matter Its called being
yourself

KELLY

Sounds boring

TABBY
Not boring Scary and wonderful and
exciting
Kelly stops squeezing paint onto his palette His

gestures
slow down Hes taking this in Then he shakes it off

KELLY
Hey Im trying to create here Stop
distracting me

swirl
of her strokes

He dips a brush into the ink and watches Xiou-Xious
restrained and confident movements
