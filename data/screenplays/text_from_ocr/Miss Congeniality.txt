etc A restaurant the ODESSA advertises authentic Russian
cooking on its window

INT ODESSA RESTAURANT -- EVENING

The place is about half-full Theres a table with a young
couple eating a table with two older couples and a larger
table where three men sit together speaking Russian and
laughing And a table where one woman sits by herself reading
a book eating her soup This is GRACIE HART She reads

eats and spills a little soup on her pants

GRACIE
Oh damn

She starts blotting her pants with a napkin when her attention
is caught by another man a huge slab of a human being who
enters from the back of the restaurant smoking a cigar

This is VICTOR KRASHOW The others rise to greet him speaking
Russian and hugging him Hes clearly the star of whatever
show theyve got going

Gracie watches out of the corner of her eye then leans into
her book and starts speaking quietly

GRACIE (CONTD)

illustrate her point

KRASHOW
Ah Vadeska koya

The Russians nod when suddenly another Russian bursts out °
of the kitchen firing at the Agents

All Hell breaks loose Customers drop to the floor Gracie
throws a table over and ducks behind it

Through the chaos she sees Krashow try to escape out the
back behind one of his guards The Guard gets shot Krashow
changes direction and jumps through a window Gracie sees
the other agents pinned down by gunfire so she leaps out
the window in pursuit

A train is pulling in He roughly pushes people out of the
way as he slowly lifts himself over the turnstile Gracie
rushes in The line at the turnstile has re-formed

GRACIE
Move FBI Get out of the way

No one moves fast enough Gracie leaps up grabs onto a steel
beam and swings herself ower the crowd and the turnstile

She looks to see Krashow getting on the train The doors
shut and the subway starts to pull out Without hesitating
Gracie leaps onto the platform between cars

INT SUBWAY -- NIGHT

Gracie bursts into Krashows car Krashow grabs a crutch
from a man to defend himself He swings it at Gracie who
gracefully ducks and then kicks him in the gut Krashow
staggers as Gracie slaps him up against a pole and handcuffs
him Then she hands the crutch back to the man

me—-hw4 8

GRACIE (CONTD)

The normal Came home had a little
dinner read the Bible

come you and I never got together

GRACIE
That is funny Shes funny -Dont
let her go

ERIC

I told her we were partners and
friends and we didnt want to let
anything get in the way of that

And its hard for two agents to have

a relationship because theres always
a chance of one of them getting shot
or blown up and its hard to raise

a family and everything --

GRACIE
And she stayed up for this whole
speech

EXT HOLLAND TUNNEL--JERSEY SIDE -- MORNING

MCDONALD
Two days ago we got a call from one
of our undercovers--Helen Franklin
She was inflitrating the Daughters
of the New American Revolution Mike--

AGENT SIMPSON pops in a tape and it comes up on the screen

We see a burning office building in Manhattan

MCDONALD (CONTD)
Theyre the folks who torched the
offices of Carmen and Rice
Publications the company that
publishes several X-Rated pornographic
magazines including She and
Everybody Loves Big Ones”

A shot of a beauty pageant comes up

MCDONALD (CONTD)
This is the Miss Pennsylvania pageant

Suddenly the lights go out in the pageant There are screams

from the pageant audience

MCDONALD (CONTD)
The Daughters knocked out the power
trashed the stage cut the hair of
several of the contestants and set
the building on fire

The screen goes blank

MCDONALD (CONTD)
Apparently there was a power struggle
going on in the Daughters and a
radical faction won out At least
thats what Franklin was reporting
Until two days ago Thats when we
lost contact with her We think her
cover was blown

Now the Agents in the room are really interested

MCDONALD (CONTD)
We searched the last location Franklin
reported from a farm upstate but
the Daughters were long gone Thats
all we know Except for one more
thing--Franklin said if the radical
faction won out the Daughters were
going for the big time--the Miss
United States pageant Theyre
planning to kill the winner Onstage

“wae

mce-hw4 12
There are mummurs in the room

McDonald stares at her then walks out of the room

GRACIE

CLONSKY

Tele-Com mid-forties successful British is there along

with his Vice-President ROB OKUN Kathy enters

There are kisses and hugs all around

SPIRO
Kathy please have a seat You know
Rob Okun our new head of marketing

KATHY
Rob of course

SPIRO
So to what do we owe the pleasure
of this visit

KATHY
Well since we discussed the ratings
decline at our last meeting I came
up with a few ideas to pep things up
a bit I thought we could add some
special effects like an animated
character who talks to the girls

SPIRO

I love that Rob jot that down
ROB

Got it
SPIRO

But I do think its going to take

more than that I think we have to
update the whole look and feel of

the pageant

a
mchw4 29

KATHY
I also had some other thoughts--

Kathy takes out a pad

SPIRO
Kathy I know how hard this is to
accept You and Stan have been with
the pageant for thirty years

ROB
But our research indicates Stan has
almost zero recognition with the 18-
49 demographic And when I say almost
zero I mean he has negative
recognition They think hes somebody
else

SPIRO
And if were bringing in a new
Management and production team
theyre going to want their own people
on board They all have way too much
respect for-you to take charge while
youre still there

Kathy looks saddened and hurt

SPIRO (CONTD)
Of course wed want you to remain
on in a consulting capacity

KATHY
Butthis is my pageant

SPIRO
No actually its Tele-Coms pageant

KATHY
Theres nothing I can do to change
your minds Ill adapt Ill change
Ill listen to gangsta rap oe

SPIRO
Kathy lets go out in style and
make this the best pageant ever
Alright

The waiter walks off

GRACIE

this pageant consulting

vic

cow I saw rolling around your wide
open trap

GRACTIE
Whats your problem

vic
My problem

GRACIE
Yeah Excuse me yes Youve been
giving me crap since I walked in
here Whats the deal Did I offend
you in some way

Other than in an olfactory sense
Meaning--

GRACIE
Smell From the Latin Olfactoris

Where Dragnet U

GRACTE
Yale

mce-hw4

VIC
Thats impossible I went to Yale

GRACIE
They can take up to three people a
century now

vic

Alright then I will tell you my
story I was the most sought after
highly paid consultant in pageant
history Every season girls would
plead with me to train them Ten of
the past eleven years my girl was
crowned and the only time I lost
the winner was a deaf mute How can
you beat that

GRACIE
Life can be so unfair

vic
Then there was last year

Vic pauses and takes a drink of wine

VIC (CONTD)
Sara Ann Lowell A perfect package
of poise grace and teeth Shed
made it into the Final Five of
course and was waiting to chat on
issues of the day Normally she was
a fountain of Bon Mots but that
night when Stan Fields asked how
she felt about affirmative action
she froze like a puddle in Antartica
Finally she mumbled something about
how we should all be affirmative
and we should all take action
Then she started to cry And then
sob Then heave

GRACIE
So I take it she didnt win

vic
No she didnt win But thats not
the worst of it Afterwards she
told a reporter she froze because of
the pressure I had placed on her
That I was a crazed perfectionist
who nitpicked and harangued her within
in an inch of her sanity
mehw4

GRACIE
Did you

vic
Of course How else could I transform
some dormitory slut from a Junior
College in Alabama into Miss United
States

GRACIE
Well theres always next year

vic
No there isn’t After the article
came out my business dried up Nobody
wanted me I was reduced to prepping
women for the local auto show I
started putting on weight and drinking
domestic wine

GRACIE
So with all due respect how come
the Bureau went after a loser like
you for this job

vic
Because everyone else worth having
already has a contestant They have
their Southern Belles Midwest Farmers
Daughters spunky Western cowgirls
And I haveDirty Harriet

INT FBI SCREENING ROOM - DAY

GRACIE

Why cant we go to the GAP

to Gracie angrily

vic
Let me tell you something--yours is
a generation that prides itself on
its so-called individuality All
this trumpeting of false bravado
about expressing your true Generation
X selves and yet like sheep you
troop en masse to the same store to
buy the exact same pair of baggy
stone washed jeans and overpriced
faux baseball jersey That is not a
revolution That is a lack of taste
and a spiritual void which reflects
the true GAP at the center of your
generation our culture and the
entire civilization

GRACIE
What about Banana Republic
vic
Youre hopeless I quit
GRACIE
Okay

vic i

Not okay I cant quit I need to
redeem myself No I am going to
rise to the challenge I am going to
take a veritable farm girl--

old dresses Im not wearing that
bathing suit

else

reaches over to the driver and pulls his sunglasses off

smart and so sensitive--youre
definitely going to win

NORA
Youre not screwing this up for us
Were going to kill Miss United
States Listen to my Mother

Stan go Kathy grabs him again

KATHY
Stan for years Nora and I were
estranged She hated everything I
stood for everything about this
pageant But when it comes down to
it blood is thicker than politics
and we she heard Tele-Com was planning
to dump us she agreed to help

NORA
Because Tele-Com is one of the most
anti-feminist chauvanistic companies
in the whole macho pig-faced world

KATHY
And the money didnt hurt her decision
either Now youre family too Stan
So we stick to the plan and were
all rich Do you understand

Stan is clearly terrified

STAN
Not really

KATHY

After Miss United States has her
head blown off on national TV itll
be the biggest show everybody missed
Which means next year when the
pageant gallantly continues flying
in the face of terrorism they get
the best ratings theyve ever gotten

NORA
Who wouldnt watch Stan Ma

KATHY
The network knows this so they sign
a new bigger deal And the severance
package I negotiated after they dumped
me guarantees a five percent piece
of any network renegotiation Youre
in for thirty thousand Stan

NORA
Youre in right Stan

GRACIE (CONTD)
The truth is the first time I really
felt like I fit in anywhere was this
week at the pageant -- because even
though we all secretly hope the other
person loses control of her bowels
during the talent competition we
all kind of pulled together Id
like to help get that kind of
cooperation and understanding in our
schools because then kids might not
get so lost Which is important
because sometimes theyre hard to
find again
