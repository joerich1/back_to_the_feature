20th CENTURY FOX FANFARE and LOGO BLUE SKY LOGO

The Blue Sky logo FADES AWAY leaving only a white TEXTURED
BACKGROUND which looks like the CU texture of BRISTOL BOARD
An INK LINE begins to draw on the paper with the character of
a SCHULZ PEN LINE forming a ROUGH CIRCLE We pull back to
reveal other ROUND SHAPES being drawn They begin to MOVE
and ROTATE progressing to ANIMATED SNOW falling in the
traditional SCHULZ STYLE as we see the OPENING TITLES As
the snowflakes fall and the camera moves the pen line is
replaced by fully rendered CG snow and a dimensional
background replaces the simple paper texture

MATCH CUT TO

EXT SKY - MORNING 1

A magnificent vista of the WINTER SKY We follow SNOWFLAKES
as they descend to the ground Through the WINTRY MIST we
see an IMAGE of a YELLOW BIRD flying towards us This is
WOODSTOCK As he approaches he EVADES the falling
snowflakes

Suddenly a mass of snow ENVELOPES him Woodstock STRUGGLES
to fly as he’s weighed down by the accumulating snow

EXT CHARLIE BROWN’S HOUSE - BACKYARD - MORNING 2

Woodstock descends slowly to the ground He tries to collect
his bearings as he comes in for a landing He lands softly
atop a PILE OF SNOW We pull back revealing the pile of
snow is in the shape of a DOG It sleeps on top of a RED
DOGHOUSE

The pile of snow EXPLODES sending Woodstock shooting up into
the air Woodstock descends back down face to face with
SNOOPY Snoopy is ecstatic to see his pal Woodstock They
hug

The neighborhood comes to life as a series of ALARM CLOCKS go
off from house to house

off the alarm
FINAL DRAFT 9115 2

A closet opens and we see a long row of the same yellow zig-
zag shirt

CHARLIE BROWN
(surveying his shirts)
Um No Not quite
(finds the right one)
That’s the one

KIDS (0S)
C’mon cC’mon

We see him try to put on his jacket For a brief moment we
see a YELLOW SHIRT with a BLACK ZIG-ZAG across it It’s
BUTTONED UP and COVERED by A WINTER JACKET

Hands grab for his BASEBALL HAT but then go for the WINTER
HAT He puts it on a familiar head We continue to hear the
HUSTLE AND BUSTLE of kids outside

We see the iconic shot of Charlie Brown’s house The door
bursts open to reveal an excited CHARLIE BROWN wearing his
WINTER JACKET and CAP He can’t wait to join the rest of the
neighborhood kids He holds a KITE in his hand

CHARLIE BROWN
I’ve got my kite Today’s the day

The kids look at him confused Charlie Brown takes off
running

Charlie Brown runs off into the distance

FINAL DRAFT 9115 5

EXT FIELD — DAY 11

Charlie Brown JAMS A KITE into a glistening snowbank from
above It’s left sticking out of the snow all by its
lonesome Charlie Brown walks away from the kite

CHARLIE BROWN
A new kite a perfect breeze it
all feels just right Now that the
Kite-Eating Tree is sleeping for
the winter we have nothing to
fear

Charlie Brown looks up into the sky to see the sun start to
peek out from behind the clouds

He works his way down the kite string

Charlie Brown is holding the string in his hand as he stares
at the kite He takes a DEEP BREATH

He turns and runs AS FAST AS HE CAN grasping the string of
the kite with all his might The string tightens

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
Liftoff

The kite shoots out of the snowbank Charlie Brown looks
back to see the kite DRAGGING ALONG THE SNOW

Then a moment later the kite slowly LIFTS INTO THE AIR

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
Wait a minute

WHOOSH The kite catches a gust of wind

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
It’s in the air IT’S FLYING1

Charlie Brown looks down the hill to see the other kids
playing on the ice pond

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
Hey guys Look Look I did
it

A SMILE grows on Charlie Brown’s face as the kite SOARS
THROUGH THE SKY

EXT ICE POND - CONTINUOUS 12

Suddenly the string TIGHTENS around Charlie Brown’s feet
He slips sliding down a hill
FINAL DRAFT 9115 6

He lands on the frozen pond and slides across the ice on his
belly He comes to a stop before his best friend LINUS who
holds onto his BLANKET

LINUS
Hey Charlie Brown Still no luck
huh

He nuzzles with his blanket

A GUST OF WIND blows The kite smacks into the back of
Charlie Brown’s head then LAUNCHES into the air taking
Charlie Brown along with it He is dragged off-screen

LINUS (CONTD)
Remember it’s the courage to
continue that counts

Charlie Brown breaks up the hockey game as he slides across
the ice

CHARLIE BROWN
Runaway kite Sorry No brakes

Charlie Brown gets up on his feet holding onto the string
He tries to steer them out of harms way Up ahead he sees
LUCY FIGURE SKATING surrounded by a group of kids

Lucy skates backwards in an ever growing circle She gains
speed setting up for a big trick

LUCY
(to the other kids)
And now for my famous Triple Axel
Prepare to be amazed

Right as she hops forward on to her ‘plant foot’ to leap-

WHAM Charlie Brown CRASHES INTO LUCY She SPINS FOUR TIMES
and lands on her butt The kids all clap

FRANKLIN
Ooh a quadruple

MARCIE
Bravo

Charlie Brown’s momentum sends him forward but he’s quickly
stopped He’s twirled around the KITE EATING TREE and
WRAPPED UP by the kite string Charlie Brown hangs UPSIDE
DOWN DAZED An AVALANCHE of snow falls covering his head

CHARLIE BROWN
Ugh Stupid Kite-Eating Tree
FINAL DRAFT 9115 7

As he settles he looks up to see OLD KITES wedged in the
branches like RELICS OF THE PAST

CHARLIE BROWN (CONTD)
Good grief

LUCY (0S)
You blockhead

The Peanuts Gang stands before Charlie Brown watching The
crowd parts as Lucy angrily makes her way out of the pack
face to face with Charlie Brown

LUCY (CONTD)
I should have known What kind of
a person tries to fly a kite in the
middle of winter Don’t you ever
know when to give up You will
never get that kite to fly Why
Because you’re Charlie Brown

Lucy taps Charlie Brown’s forehead he dangles back and
forth Lucy skates off in a huff

Charlie Brown reels dumbfounded

The CROWD DISPERSES Only Linus remains He moves to
Charlie Brown who slowly dangles back and forth He
sincerely puts his hand up and places it on Charlie Browns
forehead stopping him

CHARLIE BROWN
Thanks Linus

LINUS
Listen Charlie Brown Ignoring
what my sister Lucy says has
enabled me to make it this far in
life

CHARLIE BROWN
What would I do without a good
friend like you

Just then Snoopy enters frame by Linus GRABBING HIS
BLANKET sending him off onto the ice Snoopy begins a game
of CRACK THE WHIP

LINUS
Whoa

As Snoopy and Linus skate across the ice Linus UNKNOWINGLY
grabs hold of SALLY Sally’s EYES LIGHT UP FLOATING HEARTS
appear all around her

FINAL DRAFT 9115 8

SALLY
Awww my sweet Babboo

Linus turns back to see he is holding onto Sally He SHRIEKS
and lets go of her hand The HEARTS DISAPPEAR as she speeds
off into a SNOWBANK creating an outline of her body Her
head pops out resting on her arms a look of love in her
eyes The hearts re-appear again

SALLY (CONTD)
Isn’t he the cutest thing

MARCIE wobbles as she slowly makes her way around the ice
holding onto a chair for balance PEPPERMINT PATTY glides
around her a HOCKEY STICK in hand

MARCIE
Uh Careful sir

Snoopy and the line of kids pass by Peppermint Patty pulling
her along with them The hockey stick comes into frame it
hooks Marcie and drags her off-screen too

Snoopy and Linus move across the ice picking up more and
more KIDS as they go Among them are FRIEDA SHERMY
SCHROEDER Lucy FRANKLIN and PIG-PEN

FRIEDA
Watch the curls

ZOOM The Crack the Whip gang flies by We move along the
line of FACES

Woodstock drives a ZAMBONI cleaning the ice We are down at
his perspective as the towering line of Kids skate by He
honks to them

We pull back to reveal the scope of this winter scene The
LINE OF KIDS skate across the ice A TRAIL OF DUST follows
behind them from Pig-Pen

The WHIP CRACKS The Kids scatter across the ice They
skate around enjoying themselves

EXT BASEBALL FIELD - DAY 13

Charlie Brown sits on a WOODEN BENCH Charlie Brown rises

CHARLIE BROWN
I don’t care what Lucy says I may
have had troubles in the past
flying a kite and I may have never
won a baseball game but it’s not
for the lack of trying
FINAL DRAFT 9115 9

We see a series of quick cuts as Charlie Brown talks to
himself

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
My pitching has to improve if I
come out here to my trusty mound
every day

He walks to where home plate should be He dusts the snow
like an Umpire revealing HOME PLATE

He ASSEMBLES a SNOWMAN dressing it like a BATTER placing a
CAP on his head and a BAT in his hands

Charlie Brown walks to his trusty mound a big snow-covered
lump

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
Charlie Brown is not a quitter

Snoopy comes out of his make-shift DUGOUT with a cap on his
head He is the MANAGER He ROLLS UP A SNOWBALL and places
it in Charlie Brown’s hand

Snoopy returns to the dugout his arms hanging over the side
Charlie Brown looks to the batter

CHARLIE BROWN (CONTD)
Bottom of the ninth Two outs A
strikeout here would make the
pitcher an instant hero

Woodstock sits in the bleachers He is surrounded by a CROWD
full of MINI-SNOWMEN he created They each have an EXCITED
EXPRESSION on their face Woodstock jumps up and down on the
bench causing the crowd to do “The Wave”

Charlie Brown stares down the batter

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
It all comes down to this one
pitch

Charlie Brown looks to Snoopy in the dugout Snoopy begins
to send SIGNALS to him At first they are traditional
They quickly become more and more ERRATIC

Charlie Brown extends his hand for Snoopy to stop He’s got
this

He looks to the batter A SNOWMAN He fiddles with the ball
behind his back finding his pitch Charlie Brown STARES
DOWN the batter intensely
FINAL DRAFT 9115 10

CHARLIE BROWN (CONTD)
Let’s see if you can handle my
fastball 1’ number one The
heater The Brown Bullet

He WINDS UP He pitches the snowball OFF SCREEN
CRACK

The snowball ROCKETS BACK to him a line drive POW
Charlie Brown is LAUNCHED UPSIDEDOWN An EXPLOSION OF
CLOTHES fly into the air as they rip from his body

The snowball line-drives like a rocket across the field It
hits the CENTER FIELDER creating an EXPLOSION OF SNOW The
ball puts a HOLE through a WOODEN FENCE in the back of the
baseball diamond

Charlie Brown on his back lifts his head to see

The snowman batter jumps up and down at home plate doing a
victory dance The snow falls off to reveal it was Snoopy
inside

Snoopy sees Charlie Brown dizzy on the mound and realizes
what he has done He flips personas back to the Manager and
starts to cry pounding the ground

In the bleachers the Snowmen Crowd now have paper bags over
their heads

Charlie Brown lies on the snowy mound staring into the
wintery sky

CHARLIE BROWN (CONTD)
(to himself)
It’s going to be a long winter

We hear a low RUMBLE and a truck’s HORN From Charlie
Brown’s POV we see a MOVING TRUCK approach It drives down
the road like a Sherman tank It pulls into a HOUSE beside
the baseball field

CHARLIE BROWN (CONTD)
(to himself)
Someone’s moving in across the
street from me

The NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS run by Charlie Brown excited
FRANKLIN (0S)

Hey gang look there’s a new kid
moving in
FINAL DRAFT 9115 11

SALLY

way Ow

The Kids scramble to a wooden fence fighting for a position
to look through various holes and cracks They try and catch
a glimpse of the new kid

Charlie Brown is now dressed as he approaches the wooden
fence He is pushed to the back but tries to find a way in

CHARLIE BROWN
Hey guys What do you see Who is
it

The Kids looks through the cracks and holes of the fence

SCHROEDER
Oh I think I see a piano I hope
he loves Beethoven

LUCY

will appreciate my natural beauty

PEPPERMINT PATTY (0S)
Who cares about that As long as
he’s a better goalie than Marcie

Peppermint Patty looks down to Marcie We reveal Peppermint
Patty is standing on her head

PEPPERMINT PATTY

MARCIE

about the Great Pumpkin

SALLY

FINAL DRAFT 9115 12

Charlie Brown rolls a massive snowball up to the fence He
steps up on the snowball trying to get a glimpse of the new
neighbor

A THOUGHT BUBBLE appears above Charlie Brown We see a quick
series of all his past FAILURES

CHARLIE BROWN

(to himself)
I just hope this new kid has never
heard of me He would know nothing
of my past imperfections It’s not
often you get the opportunity to
start over with a clean slate
This time things will be different

Suddenly we hear a loud CREAKING SOUND as Charlie Brown
leans forward CRASH The entire fence falls forward down
the line in a domino effect It exposes all of the
Neighborhood Kids Their faces fill with FEAR

Charlie Brown is at the forefront of the group exposed and
embarrassed He looks back at all of the kids looking for
their support

KIDS
He did it

They SCATTER leaving Charlie Brown by himself

EXTINT CHARLIE BROWN’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 14

Charlie Brown’s house is covered in a light snow Charlie
Brown changes into his pajamas in his bedroom Snoopy sits
on his bed

CHARLIE BROWN

try turns out wrong Sometimes I
wonder if the kids really like me

Charlie Brown crawls into bed

CHARLIE BROWN (CONT’D)
Maybe that new kid will see me for
who I really am like you

CHARLIE BROWN (CONTD)

towards the school entrance Snoopy walks behind Charlie
Brown In front of the school he looks down to Snoopy and
pats him on the head

CHARLIE BROWN
You can’t come to school Snoopy
Now be a good dog and go home

An undeterred Snoopy nods and keeps walking Charlie Brown
enters the school without him After he is gone Snoopy
approaches the other kids and steals a school book from
Franklin He tucks it under his arm and puts on glasses and
an over-sized bow-tie pretending to be a student He tries
to blend in with the other students

his nose

The RC Triplane flies around the classroom sending the other
kids into a PANIC Some of them hit the deck hiding under
the desk PAPER SCATTERS everywhere

The RC plane buzzes Frieda messing up her hair

FRIEDA

FINAL DRAFT 9115 15

The RC Plane circles a GLOBE spinning it and Patty in
circles

It buzzes by a row of MULTI-COLORED ART PAINT exploding them
onto LUCY who stands nearby The colors create an exact
replica of a TOM EVERHART painting

It circles back toward Charlie Brown and Linus

CHARLIE BROWN
Duck Linus duck

They dive to the ground at the last second The RC Plane
whips over their heads

Snoopy tries to get into the school window with a crowbar
Marcie opens the window and the RC Plane flies right out and
soars off into the distance Snoopy (seeking a way into
school) is nearly hit by it as it passes him

wide

We are on a profile of Fifi as she flies In the background

out of frame He rises up a second time this time he is
much closer to Fifi

Snoopy gets Fifi’s attention She smiles at Snoopy They
have an instant connection Fifi smiles She does an amazing
trick We see she has great flying ability

It’s a game of follow the leaders as they have a romantic
flirtacious flight in the sky They dive down over a
mountain to the valley below

Fifi takes out her camera and points it at Snoopy who hams it
up She takes a series of funny photos of Snoopy As Snoopy
poses he is too distracted to see a quickly approaching BARN
FINAL DRAFT 9115 51

Snoopy flies through the barn We hear a series of loud
noises Snoopy comes out the other side covered in HAY He
looks ridiculous He smiles embarrassed Fifi smiles back

Fifi grabs a piece of CLOUD with her hands She blows it
towards Snoopy It’s in the shape of a heart Snoopy has an
idea He does a roll and comes up with a handful of flowers
He extends his hand as if to give them to her when-

Snoopy extends the flowers towards Fifi Just then the
heads of the flowers EXPLODE Snoopy and Fifi are startled

dolly slow motion shot as Snoopy and The Red Baron cross
paths The Red Baron is SILHOUETTED by the sun all we see

Snoopy can’t resist He PULLS AWAY and chases after The Red
Baron Snoopy and The Red Baron engage in a dogfight The
Red Baron begins to chase Fifi Fifi evades The Red Baron
she turns back to see he is still on her tail

Snoopy chases after The Red Baron He pantomimes “firing his
machine guns” as his arms move all over the place wildly

The Red Baron flies closer to Fifi Fifi looks up to see his
red triplane is right on top of her The Red Baron dips down
and punctures her wing with his wheel

Fifi’s damaged plane ROLLS SUDDENLY GOING TOTALLY INVERTED

Fifi FALLS OUT of the cockpit Snoopy’s eyes open wide He
shrieks and dives down after her

Just as Snoopy is about to reach Fifi she pulls the string on
her PARACHUTE She shoots up into the air Snoopy misses
her

Snoopy pulls a high-G HARD BANK TURN His face looks funny
as the G FORCE contorts it wildly

Snoopy flies back toward Fifi She slowly falls through the
air her parachute above her Snoopy sees THE RED BARON
FLYING FOR FIFI OPPOSITE HIM

IT’S A RACE TO SEE WHO WILL GET THERE FIRST

Snoopy and The Red Baron race towards Fifi as she’s suspended
in the air At the last second The Red Baron’s wing takes
the string of the parachute with him Fifi is TAKEN BY THE
RED BARON

The Red Baron flies off into the sky Snoopy gasps and
GRUMBLES Snoopy flies off after The Red Baron with all his
might Fifi holds on for her life to the wing of The Red

Snoopy gains on The Red Baron They fly towards a large
MOUNTAIN A long bridge with TRAIN TRACKS leads into a DARK
TUNNEL within the mountain A train moves toward the tunnel

The Red Baron enters the tunnel just before the train

THEY SPOT EACH OTHER time slows They each share a look of
longing and joy There is an enemy plane on Snoopy Snoopy
does a pass around the Zeppelin carriage Fifi sees that he
is in distress she grabs a CHAIR and smashes it through the
window The chair hits the ENEMY PLANE sending it into one
of the Zeppelin’s PROPELLERS DAMAGING IT

Snoopy flies back alongside Fifi He looks behind him THE
RED BARON IS COMING Snoopy’s EYES GO WIDE The Red Baron
comes up fast BANG BANG BANG Snoopy dodges the shots
but they hit THE ZEPPELIN Snoopy flies off-screen not
seeing the holes in the Zeppelin

Snoopy signals Woodstock and the Beagle Scouts to be ready

Snoopy flies AWAY FROM THE BATTLE leaving himself exposed
He makes a face to entices the Red Baron to come after him
The Red Baron has taken the bait and chases after Snoopy

close in on him

dumps junk on the Red Baron’s plane

FIFI

FINAL DRAFT 9115 90

Fifi is PANICKED She sees the damage to the Zeppelin She
searches for a way out and finds an escape hatch on the
ceiling She opens the door and pokes her head out The
WIND blows intensely into her face

Fifi hops out and holds on tight making her way along the
carriage of the Zeppelin

The damaged propeller breaks lose from the Zeppelin turning
the carriage suddenly Fifi loses her footing sliding down
the carriage She grabs hold of a ROPE

Fifi continues to navigate her way through the crippling
carriage There is danger at every turn She gets
dangerously close to the other PROPELLER

At that moment we hear a loud METAL CREAKING along with
Fifi’s SCREAM Snoopy looks over to the battle to the
Zeppelin The carriage detaches Fifi falls to the ground

SNOOPY PULLS OFF FROM THE RED BARON HE RACES TO SAVE FIFI

HELPLESS It looks like this is the end until-

SNOOPY RISES UP AND CATCHES FIFI ON HIS DOGHOUSE She lands
in his arms THEY CLIMB UP INTO THE SKY TRIUMPHANTLY

Snoopy looks around to see only Sopwith Camels remain in the
sky He look to the outskirts of the battle He sees The
Red Baron flying in the distance his plane smoking

The Red Baron’s Triplane is a wreck Parts are missing and
the fabric on the wings is ripped and torn It’s a miracle
its still flying It flies off alone defeated into the
distance

EMOTIONS comes flooding back to both of them It’s been so
