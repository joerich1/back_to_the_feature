EXT LION ENCLOSURE -- LATER DAY

The Real-Estate Man Benjamin and Rosie stand in front of
SOLOMON Solomon happens to be a large African lion with a
Majestic mane standing at attention studying these
strangers suspiciously Benjamin and Rosie stare at the
awesome animal Separated only by a small moat alone in a
zoo the relationship between man and animal gets a little
more personal

Solomon ROARS again And this one close-up rips our heads
off They collect themselves Mournfully

REAL-ESTATE MAN
It was a fully functioning zoo
until two years ago and then it was
shut down The estate is
maintaining it for now --

BENJAMIN
But can’t I I mean if we bought
this place we could just relocate
the animals right

REAL-ESTATE MAN
Actually the estate is selling it
with the stipulation that whoever
buys this place has to continue
garing for the animals And
-- the remaining staff

(MORE)

REAL-ESTATE MAN (CONTD)

animals will probably be

He looks at Rosie and Benjamin as in - “put down”
Benjamin shares a reality—ilook with Rosie

It’s a great property but no one
is going to buy it under these
conditions I mean it’s a --

REAL-—ESTATE MAN

He can no longer look at Solomon

BENJAMIN

He doesn’t see Rosie For a moment panic

BENJAMIN (CONTD)

spreading their fans in the air She’s in the middle
delighted feeding them her animal crackers Relaxed happy
carefree a kid Music returns It’s Rosies Theme

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Boy it’s a shame that we can’t
just

BENJAMIN

Shot pushes in Pure joy has returned to his life in some
email way He watches his daughter’s spontaneous romp with
these scrappy peacocks Her happiness is breathtaking He
sits down on a nearby stump quietly overwhelmed

There is no one to share this feeling with The Real-Estate
Man is already trudging up the hill Benjamin looks around
for someone for Katherine for anybody He is at the
crossroads of a powerful life decision He turns and finds
an understanding pair of eyes

SOLOMON

The Lion stares at him with ancient wisdom His eyes say
yes Yes is the answer

They stand across the moat from three tigers two young
females and an older male grizzled around the whiskers
There is a weathered elegance about the older male He is
SPAR and he waiks gingerly across the exhibit a bit creaky
but filled with a grand sense of supremacy Everyone even
the keepers view these tigers with a sense of awe Even
Dylan draws closer with interest

ROSIE
I thought they would roar Like
Solomon the Lion

Kelly is slightly annoyed by this constant misconception

KELLY
Tigers and Lions -- very different
Tigers don‘t really growl or roar
they “chuff”

Kelly skillfully demonstrates making the sound which sounds
like blowing a raspberry using her top lip

KELLY (CONTD)
You chuff at them they chuff back

She chuffs to the tigers The tigers gently chuff back at
Kelly Kelly turns to Rosie

KELLY (CONTD)
You do it

Rosie tries Nothing Then tries again Spar looks over at
her and chuffs back Rosies eyes go wide

KELLY (CONTD)
That ia Spar the oldest Hes
17 He’s a Siberian Tiger You
know tigers have special sensors
along the front of their two-inch
canines They can detect the pulse
in your aorta When they attack
they bite you take your pulse with
their teeth reposition those
suckers and boom there goes your
carotid

ROSIE
Wow

Boom We hear the sound of a gunshot

BENJAMIN
What was that --

KELLY
One of our Lionesses Lung cancer
The vet said -- it’s time

Benjamin looks around No Ellis
BENJAMIN
Ellis did that

(neds)
Life around here is pretty
elemental

DYLAN
Can we go back to the house now

EXT 200 - DAY -- MINUTES LATER
Benjamin Rogie and Dylan walk up the hill Kelly joins
KELLY

have to make right away Ben
BENJAMIN
Benjamin Ben was my dad

KELLY
Spar who you just met the tiger
is going to need some extra care
We need to have him seen by the
large animal vet from San Diego
and hes a fortune to get here --

Benjamin feels his budding altruism

BENJAMIN
Fine Set it up
KELLY

BENJAMIN

He‘s sick he needs a doctor so --

KELLY
He’s also very old Ben jamin
Truth is we dont know how much

BENJAMIN
Get the doctor I’11 pay

She‘s impressed

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)

KELLY
(brightening)
Okay weve got massive problems
with plumbing antiquated wiring
inadequate refrigeration for
storing the carcasses for the big

cats -— you don’t want to be there
on a hot day you’ll pass out from
the smells --

BENJAMIN

Got it Keep going

KELLY
Rickety posts Beak rot on the
tortoises A weak enclosure
between the Jaguars and the Tigers
They don’t get along And --

BENJAMIN
Okay enough Well start with the
cages
KELLY
The what

She glares at him incredulous

And now Kelly stops walking
She turns to him dead serious

on

BENJAMIN
Posts in the cages

KELLY
Cages They’re not cages They’re
enclosures No one has called them
a cage in about a century

BENJAMIN
Alright then --

KELLY
My brief marriage That was a
cage

BENJAMIN
Not mine

RELLY
I have a question

Benjamin looks at her ready for anything

KELLY (CONTD)
Youre some random guy no one in
the zoo community has ever heard of
you You know nothing about
animals youve moved into a dump
What regular person just up and
buys this place Especially some
one with kids Why

He doesn’t answer

He is stunned by her raw devotion to these animals

KELLY (CONTD)

You have no idea what weve been
dealing with here We used to have
three times this staff They quit
I’m 28 I never go out I’m here
all the time I’m here every day
I had to move back with my mother
I couldn’t pay my mortgage No one
gete paid Ben jamin Were so
understaffed We need volunteers

She lets the others continue

KELLY (CONT‘D)
We need someone to really take
charge of this place Or we and
all these animals are gone

BENJAMIN
So your question is --

weet
(simply)
Whyd you buy this place

BENJAMIN
Why not

He smiles and moves on She stands still

ExT BENJAMINS OFFICE -- NIGHT

A gentle wind whips at the trees by the window At his seat
at Katherines old family table Benjamin looks at the bills
spread out before him The weight of it all hits him

EXT PORCH -- NIGHT

Benjamin stands on the porch He hears what few of us ever
hear The sounds of a zoo alive at night Its a gorgeous
cacophony instruments in a symphony He’s falling in love
with his new life And in the distance the gentle sound of
laughter

INT DYLANS BEDROOM -—- NIGHT

Dylan is still awake listening to the unfamiliar noises too
Carefully he reaches under the bed and fishes around until
he finds what he’s looking for A picture frame It’s a
hoto of Dylan Rosie and their mother Katherine (Her face
is obscured in the darkness) He cradles it with everything
he’s got and waits for sleep

EXT ZOO -—- NIGHT
Benjamin squishes down the hill through some mud heading
towards the laughter

INT JAGUAR RESTAURANT -—— NIGHT

The restaurant at night is the hub of the place It’s the
staffs hang-out their clubhouse

Lily works on the letters for tomorrow’s sign in the window
The restaurant is filled with artifacts and curics ineluding
a dartboard with a vain-looking mans face on it (Its
Walter Ferris the USDA Inspector His face is also on an
ancient COFFIN in the corner) Ellis holding a whisky and
nursing a toothache launches darts at the board He speaks
to a few workers as he pulls darts out of Ferris’ face

BELLIS
Walter Ferris I‘11 kill him 1f
will Ill cut off his head with a
sword -— I‘il kill him without a
thought And he borrowed 500
from me in the 80s and claims he
doesn’t remember Crook

Kelly is playing chess with Rob at the bar counter Shes
heard it all before A few odd locais are here too An old-
school big acreen projection TV plays satellite soccer A
stereo plays an old garage rock song from the 60’s Ellis
wails along with it as 1f it were a sea-shanty

The door opens Benjamin stands there witnessing the party
he hasnt been invited to All stop and stare at him He
decides to join them uninvited walking a few steps into the
place It’s an awkward moment

Until Ellis pulls out an empty chair with his foot and shoves
it Benjamin’s way
ELLIS (CONT’D)
a bit drunk)

Its the most dangerous animal in

the forest The Adult Boomer Male
Benjamin smiles tips an imaginary hat and sits down Kelly
points at her beer -- want one Benjamin nods He sings
along to the old song along with Ellis

Camaraderie continues wordlessly as they return to their
previous behavior Kelly brings over the beer

RELLY
Here you go Boss

She sets it at his table

INT PORCUPINE ENCLOSURE - DAY

Benjamin walks purposefully into the Porcupine enclosure He
repraces a crumbling wooden post Two PORCUPINES watch
calmly He speaks to them in a voice still slightly too
folksy and self-aware

BENJAMIN
Hey Guys You are going to love
your new enclosure Look at the
quality of this new post --

Benjamin calls over to Robin carrying feed

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
They’re so docile

ROBIN
Not at night

Benjamin BANGS down a new wooden post

BENJAMIN
So you get wild at night huh

In a flash one of the Porcupines wheels around and in
reverse begins charging him with razor-sharp quills bared
Benjamin HOPS the enclosure pronto He falls over the
fence into a thicket of nettles Nettles Worse than
quills Benjamin begins picking them out painfully

ROBIN
(Laughing)
You dont talk to them correctly
Boss Be real with them They can
tell the difference

Benjamin speaks to the Porcupine who shot him He’s pissed

FERRIS
“Pop bys” Mr Mee are by their
very nature a surprise

Ferris whips out his notepad
Benjamin whips out his own notepad It’s on

FERRIS (CONT’D)

frustrates him sometimes

DYLAN

Benjamin sighs deeply He rounds the corner and stops at a
stop sign néar the zoo While he’s stopped a surreal sight
plays out in front of their car

It’s a MASSIVE BROWN BEAR meandering acrose the road like a
Pedestrian crossing in front of them The bear stops and
lumbers up to the window stares at Benjamin and then
continues

Buster is loose

another one in his hand He hurls it away with incredible
force and disappears

KELLY 05

BENJAMIN
(running shouting)

sure don‘t need the publicity of an
gcape

He suddenly stops He sees what we don’t And then camera
drifts around to reveal Buster is eight feet away
Staring at him Suddenly all is calm We hear the yelling
voices of the others but there is utter silence between man
and animal here

It could go either way

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Buster

Buster looks at him curiously and then starts to move
closer sniffing the air The scent is guiding him towards
Benjamin Benjamin begins speaking in a very calm voice

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
I‘m not going to hurt you Yes I
had some lunch Pizza
S7

Buster sneezes And puts out his arm to the side as if
demonstrating something

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Gesundheit buddy

Benjamin demonstrates the same behavior For a moment its
like two mimes showing off their moves Buster looks
entertained by Benjamin Hes comforted Benjamin feels
deeply connected

BENJAMIN -— PROFILE

As Buster inches into frame we truly grasp the explosive
power and size of the animal

KELLY
(nearby shouting)
Confirmation He broke the latch
on the enclosure

Buster ROARS loudly
BENJAMIN
I understand I feel that way most
of the time
We are now on the hair-trigger precipice of real violence
This is not a “fun” bear This is the real thing And deep
inside Benjamin feels like this may be the end
BENJAMIN (CONTD)
i don’t care about me But you’1l
make my kids sad

Buster looks at him understandingly and what looks to us
like a depth of feeling

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
Well one of them for sure

Something passes between them And then

BAM

BAM BAM BAM

Buster gets a dazed look and crumples to the ground

The others swarm closer and all are suddenly on cell-phones
We can hear the chatter

ROBIN KELLY
Benjamin was doing some hypno- Benjamin contained him He’s
voodoo stuff on h — okay

Benjamin shrugs it off He’s still in shock really He
looks down at the tranquilized bear who was just moments
earlier communicating deeply with him

That’s what they do before you
become chips and salsa

BENJAMIN
No I think we were dancing

ELLIS

Benjamin is still staring at the bill The Vet puts a
reassuring hand on his shoulder

VET (CONT’D)

Benjamin looks at him —- good point -- and slowly withdraws
his Zoo credit card The Vet snatches it with an elaborate
flourish runs in through the machine gets the signature
and leaves Benjamin with a receipt all in a swirl of pomp
He tucks the card machine into the leather case It is his
ritual The Vet exits Benjamin feels drained in almost
every way He mumbles “The Worlds Most Expensive Vet”

60 Many ways And for a while it
was better it was But the funny
thing is it turns out she’s here
too I go to Home Depot or the
Target-Nine-Miles-Away seriously
I’m avoiding half the aisles
Pasta condiments pastries -- she
loved Blueberry Pop-Tarts well who
doesn’t but this girl could eat
eight desserts and not gain a
pound or bat an eye I turn on
the radio sad songs happy songs
any songs they’re all her the
other night I picked up the list
of our favorite channel numbers
her handwriting destroyed me It
used to be by our bed It’s still
by my bed The numbers arent even

ea « I cannot let go
And why should I

Kelly neds This was her revelation several nights ago She
listens and he continues

BENJAMIN (CONT‘D)
Coffee is no good either I met
her in a coffee shop its a sill
story but I think about it all the
time The first thing she said I
sort of live by it
él

KELLY
Tell me

BENJAMIN
I dont want to I’d have to use
the past tense And by the way
let’s not mention French food
Anything French her favorite
French people French accents
French toast France itself French
Fries Frenchs Mustard our
dishes our books our clock the
couch where she napped the chair
where she stopped living

Kelly listens still not moving She’s alternately charmed
and horrified at her lack of a chance with this guy

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
And most cf all the kids Rosie
the little dance she does when she
eats something she likes or --

Behind them a light goes on a window opens Neither

notices

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
— or Dylan his eyes I’ve only
seen that shade of green on one
person before And the way he
drives me nuts makes me crazy
denies me frustrates me looking
back at me with her green eyes and
mone of her lightness

She listens

Beat

He jokes

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
What I figured out is that when you
love someone that much that hard
for that long you can’t get away
from them no matter where you go
And why shouid you

BENJAMIN (CONTD)
Half the time I feel like I’m
running across the Sahara in lead
shoes with a plastic bag over my
head I can’t get a

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
“Handle on it”

KELLY
You’re scaring me

BENJAMIN
I was the best version of me
because she loved me And now
without her I wake up every day
and think “now I gotta fool
everybody into thinking I know what
Im doing for another day” And
Dylan that little hardass -- he
sees right through me

He looks at Kelly There is power in his realization and in
her listening to him

BENJAMIN (CONT’D)
I cannot let qo

Beat

Kelly pats his knee She sighs She has no chance He’1l1
belong to Katherine forever

KELLY
i can

She smiles bittersweetly rises to exit Gave it her best
Upstairs a door SLAMS

INT HALLWAY — LATER NIGHT
Benjamin goes to check finds Dylan defiant in the hallway

DYLAN
I get it now okay I get why you
can’t stand me

Benjamin tries to herd Dylan and the “problem” back into his
room He immediately dismisses the content of Dylan’s words
and it pisses him off more

BENJAMIN
Okay -- alright --

DYLAN
(wont budge)
No At least now I know the real
reason you hate me I heard you
admit it to her Like you were
talking about corn flakes you
hate me

He catches Benjamin’s full attention
BENJAMIN
Hate you Come on youre a good
kid Youve made mistakes weve
made mistakes we’re working
through ‘em I don’t blame you for

DYLAN

You mis-heard me

DYLAN

BENJAMIN
Well thank you for telling me that

DYLAN
It’s your dream You can’t force a
dream on somebody else

BENJAMIN
(just pissed)
Yes IT can Because I’m your father

The line of people who really care
about you in this world

DYLAN
(simply)
You never ask me how I’m doing

information)
You want to know how to shave
Id jove to teach you to shave

him down He’s just plain tired Spar talks alright

And suddeniy Benjamin is aware of somebody else in the
enclosure He turns expecting Kelly

It’s Dylan

Dylan says nothing either He sits down on the concrete
floor next to Benjamin

For a moment they just sit there leaning against the wall
looking at Spar whose body rises and falls softly with his
breath This is the big cat’s final mile

DYLAN
You did your best Dad He knows
that

Benjamin nods

BENJAMIN

something I liked her

BENJAMIN

before and after the photos were taken mixed in with the
stills Katherine’s face is always obscured in what we’ve

Several look at each other

FERRIS

BENJAMIN
One of our peahens recently hatched
a brood --

FERRIS

Ferris narrows his eyes He sniffs a problem

FERRIS
Lets go see Sclomon’s enclosure

EXT LION ENCLOSURE —— DAY

trying to jiggle the lock to fix it

A beat Kelly hears the low rumble of a growl She looks
up into the eyes of Solomon now aware that Kelly is
concerned

KELLY
Hello fella

Solomon locks at her steady Just then Ellis comes running
at full speed down the hill towards Kelly

KELLY (CONTD)
Oh thank God I asked you so
politely I wasn’t sure youd come

ELLIS

knew something was up What’s
wrong

KELLY
Lock’s broken And the only thing
we can do oh God Is jimmy it

Hey Boy You don’t want me Im
pickled in Scotch and bitterness
and impure thoughts

Solomon licks his chops

ELLIS (CONTD)
So that’s your thing

Kelly stifles a scream Ellis turns away from the beast and
continues his work fast and assured Solomon still
considers the old man as appetizer He then yawns and trots
the other way Ellis hops over the fence and SLAMS the
door re-aligning the lock which pops cleanly into place
oo

Dylan disappears around the corner to the side driveway
Benjamin follows and sees

lan standing in front of a giant tree almost four feet
high lying across the driveway

it When he straightens he can see across the hillside
below We watch his face Shocked Barely able to process
what he sees

KELLY
Benjamin what’s wrong

She runs over and scrambles up onto the log beside him
Everyone does the same Rosie requiring a boost from Lily
Kelly stands beside Benjamin We see what he’s looking at

ROSIE (CONTD)

Peafowl are very resilient animals
Some have escaped from captivity
and have established wild
communities However due to the
fact that there are so many
peafowl some people consider them
to be a zoologically insignificant
animal

She smiles

ROSIE CONT’D)
We ignore those people
