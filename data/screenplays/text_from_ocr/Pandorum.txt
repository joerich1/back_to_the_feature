PANDORUM

DEEP SPACE

A darkness like no other a silence that is unsettling

Sharp pinholes of light show a sea of distant stars across

the void of outer space Our own motion is only realized as

an enormous object slowly moves towards us taking shape

A SPACE SHIP of unimaginable size a tubular freighter
easily

ten times larger then any aircraft carrier At first glance

it appears lifeless and adrift but slowly the small glow of

cockpit windows come into view as we move closer

Moonlight cuts across the hull displaying the name EDEN

BOWER (V0)
Where were you when Eden was lost
Like every other kid on my block I was
in the middle of a dream envious of
those who were chosen to be part of
mankinds greatest quest Dreaming of
the unknown and trying to imagine what
only the lucky few would encounter
We PUSH IN towards the cockpit windows and

DISSOLVE THRU
INT COCKPIT (EDEN) - CONT

Inside the flight deck its ghostly vacant rows of empty
flight chairs and numerous guidance computers gently
blinking With half filled coffee-cups and jackets hung over
the seat backs it appears the control deck has been
suddenly evacuated

Muffled SCREAMS are heard somewhere deeper inside the ship

BOWER (V0)

As the entire world watched in wonder
there were only a few skeptical of the
journeys success
(BEAT)
Only a few who would be right
The further we move into the ship signs of violence
appear smears of dark blood sharply standing out on the
bright white paneling and several broken computer screens
The muffled SCREAMS grow louder and clearer an argument
between men panicked rage over-lapping

CAMERA slowly moves past a corner to see the middle-of a
violent confrontation One OFFICER is locked inside a sleep
chamber banging on the glass and pleading with panic
Another OFFICER is on the floor mortally wounded his body
still twitching with his head bashed in The INSANE OFFICER
a young corporal is moving from terminal to terminal typing
in commands with a casual and emotionless nature
Blood streams have run down his face from both ears and nose
as he continues to type commands into the flight computer
heightening the trapped OFFICERS muffled screams

TRAPPED OFFICER

(IN FRENCH)
STOP IT STOP FOR GODS SAKES PLEASE
GOD NO
The INSANE OFFICER hits the final command key and warning
buzzers ignite with flashing lights He closes his eyes
taking a breath of relief

TRAPPED OFFCIER

(IN FRENCH)

STOP IT YOU DONT KNOW WHAT THIS WILL

DO TO- YOURE NOT- STOP YOURE GOING
TO FUCKING KILL US ALL

The trapped OFFICER begins pounding on the glass with a
crazed panic as the INSANE OFFICER calmly goes to his own
sleep-pod and climbs inside sealing the hatch

TRAPPED OFFCIER (CONT-D)
(IN FRENCH)

PLEASE GOD NO NO GOD DAMMIT

Control panels flash and hydraulics ignite Like a row of
tumbling dominos each of the sleep-chamber pods shift
positions with a SHUSH of hydraulics and then they are
launched with a ROAR of micro-jets

CUT TO
EXT SHIP EDEN - CONT

Were suddenly back into the unsettling silence as like a
bee hive thats exploded thousands of coffin-sized sleep
pods are ejected from the ship in unison They are sent
tumbling into open space in every direction as the ship
slowly continues its unaffected course

The trapped OFFICER is seen SCREAMING in silence inside his
own pod

DISSOLVE TO
EXT OUTER SPACE

We slowly float towards an astroid field As we grow closer
its the sea of sleep pods slowly floating through space

BOWER (PO)

Where was I when I heard wed lost
Eden Just like every other kid on my
block I was dreaming of being one
edges

who would be chosen to follow

As we move closer to the asteroid field of sleep pods its
obvious that time has passed a single skeleton inside each
of the pods hands in a clawing position towards the glass
We PUSH IN towards one pod moving towards the SKULL still
locked in a SCREAMING position wide mouthed and

Cut TO

M HYPER-SLEEP CHAMBER

A RUMBLE passes EYELIDS TWITCH A GASP

Inside a coffin-size chamber a dim glow of light seeps
through a small glass porthole A MAN is asleep a mask
attached to his face tubes of liquid feeding into his arms
CORPORAL BOWER military physique chiseled features His
chest lightly expanding blood pulsating through his veins
Lights FLICKER PAST and his body comes to life muscles
flinching breath quickening He squirms with discomfort
ripping away the mask He gasps trying to SCREAM

CUT TO
INT SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT

His scream is muffled under three inches of glass The hatch
door is hit with a THUD and white gases erupt from the

THUD THUD THUD The door bursts open and BOWER scampers
out struggling to rip away the feeding tubes He HITS the

floor naked and gasping His pores ignite dripping sweat
He tries to get to his feet but his legs wobble underneath
him collapsing He yells at the floor

BOWER
Burns are red Bruises blue-

His voice echoes into the dark alone in a cavernous room as
he pauses struggling for orientation He gets to his feet
muscles twitching His short-cropped hair is pure white
into

BOWER (CONTD)
Hey HEY Someone
A constant low RUMBLE is present joined by the occasional
MOAN and CREAK of a large ship A SHUDDER travels through
the room with a random FLICKER of LIGHTS to reveal
A massive steel compartment tangled with technology Its
cold and institutional High-tech computer terminals slope
out of the floor The FLICKER passes taking us into black
We hear him fumbling through the room switches are thrown
with no result and compartments are pulled opened and
SNAP A glow stick comes to life
He squints at his darkened surroundings with confusion A
drip of liquid catches his eye and he staggers back to his
sleep pod He grabs the dangling tubes that were ripped from
his arm and he sucks on the tube pulling as much liquid

his mouth as possible

After a few heavy gulps he suddenly heaves towards the
floor He painfully forces himself to drink gasping

He looks up to notice two sleep chambers next to his own He
leans closer with the glow stick to see the first one the
name plate reading 2nd Lt Cooper Its EMPTY

The third pods name plate reads LT PAYTON Deep inside
there is the figure of a man asleep under a mask

BOWER (CONTD)
Payton Lieutenant Payton
He turns back to his own pod seeing the name plate that
reads CORPORAL BOWER Even this name doesnt seem familiar

BOWER (CONTD)
Bower Bower
The loss of memory heightens his fear even more as a shiver
travels through his body while he staggers towards a nearby
computer terminal He taps the keys on a computer terminal
Nothing He frowns leaning closer

As he taps the keyboard powder blooms out from under his
fingers He wipes the surface of the panel to see a thick
layer of dust Under the smear is

Elysium - Flight Systems - Operation Terminal 87153-D

He pulls focus to see his FINGERS are trembling
uncontrollably an odd vibration of nerves He slowly makes
a fist with concern

CUT TO
INT STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

BOWER walks along a row of storage lockers reading each name
plate He stops at the locker labelled Corp Bower He
pauses mumbling the name once again with no recognition

BOWER

Bower

He opens the locker to see an assortment of personalized
belongings uniform and gear none of it seeming familiar
He uses a towel to wipe off the layer of sweat and oily
substance coating his body pausing to see an identification
tattoo on his forearm that reads FLT005AÂ»015

He pulls on a black flight suit emblems and military
markings of rank on the chest He pulls on shoes and a tool
belt with a high powered pen-lamp

On the inside of the locker is a emergency manual card with
block figures displaying breathing and stretching exercises
labelled Hyper-Sleep Disorientation Recovery Procedures

BOWER waves his hand over a sensor no power He steps in
front of a heavy set of steel doors flipping several
switches and nothing

CUT TO
BOWER breaks open a storage bin pulling out beverage

and a cup taking a seat at the control desk With Evalons
photograph leaned against the console he becomes lost ina
gaze as he gulps down nutrient pills and stirs an instant
coffee as we

PUSH IN
There is a conflict in his eyes memories trying to return

FLASH CUT
An image FLASHES past EVALON smiling as BOWER kneels next

her gripping her hands
BOWERS gaze remains hollow frown deepening as he sips the

cup and winces with disgust
BOWER
Faa-uck
Distant THUMPS He pans the pen-lamp across the ceiling and
toward the sounds PAYTONS sleep chamber

THUMP THUMP THUMP Muffled and desperate CRACK Bower
jumps back as someone kicks their way out from inside the
hatch bursting open Out climbs

PAYTON a man in his forties but the rugged physique of a
man half his age lean and agile His military-style hair
cut is also pure white Gasping for breath he hits the
floor as BOWER tries to help him PAYTON jerks with shock

BOWER (CONTD)
Whoa Hey easy Lt Payton Youre-
Sir whoa
PAYTON chokes and gasps then glances up giving Bower a

over with a frown and a sobering tone

PAYTON

BOWER

PAYTON takes breaths trying to regain his senses
around at their darkened surroundings

PAYTON
Hit the lights will ya

BOWER
Ah were having some power problems-

PAYTON
Who woke you up

BOWER
Umm not sure It had to have been the
flight computer Theres no one here
(off his look)
-except us

PAYTON
Cold in here

BOWER grabs him a towel and water container turning back to
see PAYTON doesnt waste any time stretching his limbs

BOWER
Theres no power coming off the main
grid Cant fire any of the
(searching for word)
Dynos Cant even open the doors
PAYTON glances to the other empty sleep-chamber with a
frown

BOWER (CONTD)
(off his look)
Our 2nd Lieutenant I dont know where
he is It was empty when I woke up
None of the systems are on-line
Mainframe is down so I dont know how or
why it engaged independently-

PAYTON
Bower
BOWER
Yeah

PAYTON
Until I have two coffees youre just
gonna have to repeat all this shit so
lets just idle here for a bit

BOWER
Sorry I just- Just glad to see you

PAYTON gets to his feet stumbling BOWER catches him under
the arm as they stagger into the wall

BOWER (CONT D)
name-

Easy Lieutenant Easy

PAYTON
Coffee

BOWER
Im on it

PAYTON

Good man
BOWER helps him to the locker room as LIGHTS FLICKER past

CUT TO
INT STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

PAYTON staggers along the row of storage lockers as BOWER
helps guide him with the flashlight beam PAYTON pauses with
a frown as he glances across the name-plates none of them
seeming familiar BOWER gestures toward the locker the

plate reads LT PAYTON

BOWER
This is you sir

PAYTON
How do you know that

BOWER
1 Its the name on your sleep pod sir
PAYTON opens the door to see his belongings inside a photo
of WIFE (MARIANNE) inside the door He stares at it with
utter confusion BOWER takes this in looking to the memory
recovery card inside the locker

BOWER (CONTD)
it says that the memory loss is only
into

suppose to be a momentary loss thats-

PAYTON
Very reassuring I guess when you gamma
the brain into extended REM sometimes it
can take a while to get it back
PAYTON pulls on his flight uniform and squeezes his feet

his shoes BOWER notices the identification tattoo on his
forearm partially obscured from view

FLT00 (obscured by grime hair and angle) Unlike his
own PAYTONS tattoo is faded with age

BOWER
Ive been awake for at least an hour and
I still cant remember my anything
PAYTON
Listen the last time I crawled out of a
hyper bunk it took me quite a while

to get it all back
BOWER holds his frown as PAYTON squeezes his finger into a
wedding ring

BOWER
What was your last flight sir

PAYTON

(BEAT)
Dont recall The Kuiper Belt odyssey
Dont worry itll come back eventually
PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife

PAYTON (CONTD)
Ive gone through this before I just
cant remember why I would agree to do it
again
PAYTON goes to close his locker and BOWER motions with a
serious tone

BOWER
Sir I know this is going to sound
strange but do you even know where were
going I can remember the training
but not the mission Know the
procedures not the destination

PAYTON
I figured youd tell me

BOWER
Didnt even know the ships name until I
saw it-on the console For all I know
this was another damn training exercise-

PAYTON
rust me its not if this isa
simulation
PAYTON notices both of their reflections off the mirrored
panel inside the locker revealing their WHITE HAIR

fq

PAYTON (CONTD)

Someone is taking the joke a little far

He shuts the locker and they exit the flashlights beam
panning away taking us into darkness

CUT TO
INT SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENTCONTROL DESK - LATER

BOWER and PAYTON are standing at the control console the
screens flickering with distortion BOWER hands him a coffee
and PAYTON takes a sip with a wince of disgust

BOWER
None of the activators are working

PAYTON
Figures We can ride two hundred
thousand tons of space freighter across
the galaxy without a dent in the hood
but cant get one good cup of coffee
PAYTON flips a few switches with no result of power

BOWER
Without the mainframe we cant connect
I dont know how well ever be able to-
PAYTON is in his element at the control desk flipping open
an emergency auxiliary-power panel He snaps open a handle
and he forcefully gives it several rotations with a MOAN of
whirling magnetos The hand-crank allows a dim glow of
electricity to the light panels

BOWER (CONTD)
Oh I- didnt even think of that

PAYTON gives him a look with a grin and flips a switch

PAYTON
Payton on the con Respond This is Lt
Payton of flight Team Shit-

BOWER
Five

PAYTON
Five How do you know that
BOWER pulls up his sleeve exposing his tattoo ID PAYTON
nods good thinking

PAYTON (CONT-D)
Lt Payton of Flight Team Five Does
anyone copy Anyone respond Anyone
awake up there
Dead static

BOWER
Team Four suppose to be here for the
shift rotation Where could they be

PAYTON
Fucking teamsters Maybe they couldnt
get to us
BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber

BOWER
Where could he have gone
PAYTON gazes off blankly A RUMBLE of FLICKERING LIGHTS pass
and the computer screens slowly fade going black

PAYTON
The power systems must be free-floating
off blown circuits or something The
over-ride grid wont even lock in

BOWER
Whatta ya think

PAYTON
I think we need to find a deck of cards
and call the union
Distant THUMPS are heard overhead and they freeze
watching
the ceiling with uncertainty

BOWER
Somebody is up there
PAYTON
Hmm Ventilation maybe Systems keep

re-booting after each surge That could
be anything
THUMPS fade as the ship eerily MOANS and CREAKS

PAYTON (CONTD)
I say we get out of here Id rather be
up and out then stuck in the trunk
The room is blocked by the two heavy steel doors on either
end security doors ten feet wide PAYTON leads the way
towards one end gesturing towards the doors

PAYTON (CONTD)
Were not far from the bridge but without
the circuits locked in I dont know
how we could ever get this thing open
As they approach their flashlight beams pan across the door
to see jagged chips and scratches all along the edges Tools
are scattered on the floor the control panel ripped open

BOWER
Jesus Somebody was trying to get out

PAYTON
Ironic I think it was built to protect
us
BOWER
(gesturing to the third pod)
Well he got out some how
A RUMBLE approaches another SHUDDER that FLICKERS the

lights They watch the ceiling as BOWER counts in his head
as it fades

BOWER (CONTD)
Cycle is broken

I

PAYTON
What

BOWER
Its not circuitry Reactor timing is
off-set in the core Seems sporadic but
its not Each revolution decreasing
before starting over from the beginning

(MORE )

BOWER (CONTD)
Its trying to reconnect but it wont

until its reset

PAYTON
How the hell do you know that

BOWER
I dunno I cant remember my own- but I
know everything there is to know about
that damn reactor

PAYTON
The training stuc

BOWER
And I know that
Another SHUDDER approaches

BOWER (CONTD)
Thats twelve revolutions before
recycling And this one will only last-
As they watch the ceiling their flashlight beams stop on a
small ventilation shaft thats been ripped open They
exchange a look and

CUT TO
INT VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

Their lights spill inside an endless steel shaft only a foot
and a half in diameter leading into darkness

PAYTON
Now if we only had a monkey and a rope
PAYTON climbs down as BOWER rotates his jaw with eagerness

BOWER
Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this
way Dont you think

PAYTON
Must have

BOWER
Its the only way out

PAYTON
I think were better off waiting here-

BOWER
For what If the mainframe is off-line-

PAYTON
Were not going to be able to get to the
bridge or even be able to open that door
from the other side-

BOWER
But we can at least find out whats

HAPPENED -

PAYTON
Do you remember just how big this ship
is kid We dont know where that will
come out if at all-

BOWER
But we can at least try to-

PAYTON

(SOBERLY)
I cant do that

BOWER
Cant do Sir

PAYTON
Listen I have to take a handful of
Doxitol just to get in the hyper-bunk

BOWER
Youre claustrophobic

PAYTON
I can take a lot thats not one of âem

BOWER

(BOLDLY)
I can take it

PAYTON
(SIGH)
Real boy scout is that it You get lost
in there and youre a footnote in the

FLIGHT REPORT-

BOWER
You can guide me over two-way
PAYTON eyes him over with reluctance

BOWER (CONTD)
You know theres something wrong How
long can we wait in here before we have
to try something

(MORE )

BOWER (CONTD)
(gesturing to 2nd Lt pod)
How long did he wait
Silent stare as a SHUDDER passes flickering the lights

BOWER (CONTD)
What if no one else is awake and theres
no one at the wheel

CUT TO
INT STORAGE LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

They dig through compartments collecting tools BOWER puts
on a boom-mic clips the radio on his belt and tests the
transmitter PAYTON goes through a drawer of office
supplies handing him an ENVELOPE OPENER

PAYTON
Just in case
(off his look)

-theres mail you need to open quickly

BOWER tucks it into a zipper pocket and his photograph falls
out PAYTON watches as he tucks it back in and zips up

PAYTON (CONTD)

Wife
BOWER
Yeah I think so
PAYTON

Must be newlyweds How can you forget
something like that

BOWER
What do-you remember Anything yet

PAYTON

(EYES NARROWING)
Still a little fuzzy but youre the cocky
little shit who wanted the window seat

BOWER
And youre the cranky old bastard who
made me take the aisle

PAYTON
Give it some more time pal

Cut TO

INT VENTILATION SHAFT - MOMENTS LATER

BOWER squeezes inside pushing himself forward several feet

as PAYTON peeks inside behind him With one last look BOWER

holds the pen-lamp in his teeth and begins to crawl pushing

himself forward on his stomach only several inches at a
time

in a rhythmic motion
fading

Grunt slide breath Grunt slide breath

BOWER quickly pushes himself forward reaching an
intersection
in the shaft

BOWER (CONTD)
Got an intersection here

PAYTON (ON RADIO)

What are the choices

The light pans to endless shafts in each direction He SNAPS
a glow stick to life letting it drop down the vertical

shaft silently into nothing
BOWER
A whole lot of the same nothing

PAYTON (ON RADIO)

If youre gonna take a turn lets keep
track That way you can get back if
theres no way out

BOWER
Dont say that
BOWER lowers his head breathing heavily

PAYTON (ON RADIO)

If you havent seen anything yet maybe

you should head back now

BOWER sets his jaw and suddenly spots a SPIDER gently
dropping down from a string of web It lands and quickly
scurries away

emblem above it a global shape with a spiral design

As he stares at the emblem it seems memories are returning
a frown hardening on his face
Distant THUMPS snap him from his trance and he pans his

sloping shaft clawing at the walls The flashlight falls
rolling and sliding into the darkened abyss He frantically
tries to grip a pipe but his hand slips picking up speed

BOWER (CONT D)

No no NOOO000

He slides head first into a vertical drop the shaft
tightening like a funnel crushing his lungs and SLAM He
crashes into a steel grate where his flashlight lays Its a

The RUMBLE approaches A SHUDDER that sends a domino effect
of metallic CLANKS towards him from below Small shafts of
light break through as small vents open in the side walls
His fingers dig the envelope opener from his pocket as the
RUMBLE fades CLANKING the vents shut just as

He stabs the envelope opener into an open vent Metal bends
He begins to BANG his elbow against the vent over and over

INT MESS HALL - LATER

SHUSH THUD BOWER forces open a single paneled hatch door
and cautiously enters into an institutional style mess hall
Hundreds of lunch tables and chairs Random SPARKS of light
erupt from neon lights overhead

As he moves across the massive room the neatly lined rows
gradually become more dishevelled chairs knocked over and
unknown liquid dripping from the tables Garbage litters the
floor a dim glow of light emerging from the galley
He crawls along the edge of the counter and peeks inside the
galley horribly ran-sacked In the midst of the wreckage a
darkened FIGURE is seen scavenging through the cupboards
angrily tossing empty containers aside

The FIGURE pauses sensing a presence and glances back as
BOWER ducks He contemplates pulling out the envelope
opener and slowly peeks back out and

POW Hes HIT in the face blood spraying slamming onto his
back The pen-lamp and envelope opener spin across the
floor BOWER tries to get up and hes grabbed by the hair a
blade pressed against his neck

fend her off She throws the blade the blunt end deflecting
off his forearm

He ducks below the tables as a FIGURE slowly enters the

carrying a long steel spear-like device with a splinter of
blinding BLUE FIRE on the tip fueled with a chemical

like a welders torch
His obstructed view reveals the FIGURE as a tribal warrior
scantily clad elongated muscular frames pale skin coated

hydraulic fluid Bald head with clumps of tangled hair It
moves smoothly and silently jabbing the tip of the flaming
device into each corner and crevasse as if flushing out
anything hidden

BOWER (CONT-D)

What the hell is-
The FIGURE quickly spins his direction and SNAPS a lever on
the spear-device killing the blue flame and taking us
instantly into darkness
BOWER holds his breath with fright back pedalling on his
knees as his eyes try to adjust to the dark He takes an
uneasy breath to realize there is more then one
Slowly moving out of the shadows four more HUNTERS slowly
emerge like a unified pack on the prowl They carry an
assortment of crudely made weapons spears and blades of
sharpened metal
The apparent leader of the pack is HEFLIN the largest and
strongest of the group and he directs the pack with an
assortment of odd vocal sounds deep HISSES from the throat
and gargled CACKLES
On command the one HUNTER flips a lever and the BLUE FLAME
crackles back to life with a burst of flammable liquid The
hunt continues the pack weaving through the debris
following NADIAS path

As the BLUISH GLOW fades BOWER is left bewildered and
terrified Suddenly his radio sounds

decorative scars marking his skin

The only clear view is off an overturned bowl that shows
WEASELS face oddly contorted in the rounded reflection
WEASEL is headed directly for BOWER until a HISS from

turning back the torch fades from view taking us into
black

begins to crawl away

tremendous BLAST of energy off to the side

-The weapon is designed to destroy biological and organic
material but for safety precautions its unable to
penetrate man-made materials like lead glass or steel Its
unable to puncture the ships hull

The energy blast is an electrical discharge that CRACKS like
lightening and echoes like thunder The blast HITS the side

fastened down within a thirty foot radius This little thing
packs a punch

toward HEFLIN completely unaffected by the threat He
squeezes the trigger and

KA-WHAP The gunshot is THUNDEROUS HITTING the unseen glass
divider between them The safety glass absorbs the blast

and then slowly double back Torches fading

ANGLE ONCLOSE UP
BOWERS face fills with blood as he hangs upside down

to catch his breath His grip is weakening as he looks up to
see a shadowed FIGURE crouched with a spear in hand
leering at him from the shadows approaching With no time
to defend himself and no where to go

SCREECH

The cable is violently tugged from above jerking BOWER
upward pulling him away from the wall He spins wildly
trying to grab back onto the wall as

SCREECH

The cable yanks BOWER upwards with enough force to hit the
ceiling and swing toward the open shaft His fingers claw at
the wall as hes literally being reeled in like a fish He
sees the FIGURE charging with a bladed spear Hes knows
hes done for and

hand

SNAP The wire is slashed BOWER breaks free hitting the
floor as the cable is jerked up and out of sight

ANGLE ON
The silhouettes of the HUNTERS on the ledge several levels
above inspect the loose cable and after a HISS they turn
back fading into the shadows
BOWER lays on his back squirming in the tangled wire as the
FIGURE hovers over him spinning a bladed weapon in his

BOWER (CONT D )

Please dont- Please listen-

The FIGURE slashes BOWERS sleeve rips away the fabric and
looks at his identification tattoo

BOWER quits squirming as the FIGURE leans closer into the
light with a curious frown

TANAKA a Japanese man in ripped and modified clothing
Unlike the awkward gauntness of the HUNTERS he has a full-
framed hard-edged physique and soft brown eyes

They share a nod and an awkward silence BOWER still eyeing
the razor sharp weapon in his hand and not wanting to move

BOWER
Thanks Thanks for that
TANAKA is dead pan BOWER flinches as TANAKA picks up the
energy gun and then flips it over handing it back to

him
BOWER cautiously accepts as he climbs to his feet

Realizing louder doesnt mean clearer BOWER sighs at his
own
idiocy TANAKA nods but with obviously no clue what was

TANAKA hands him a flashlight BOWER does his best charades
gesturing to himself and pointing to the ship

BOWER (CONT-D)
Listen Im going to find out what went

wrong with the ship
TAANAKA
Shee-ip
BOWER

BOWER slowly backs away and TANAKA follows BOWER stops
I eyeing his numerous bladed weapons

BOWER (CONTD)
No Listen you should stay Wait

his flashlight quickly towards the corner Wielding the

His flashlight pans up the wall to the ventilation shaft

PAYTON (CONTD)
Dower That cant be you-
The SOUNDS remain muffled deeper within the wall possibly
from inside the ventilation shaft
PAYTON contemplates eyes panicked He climbs up the wall
and wedges the panel cover over the shaft opening jamming

closed with a screwdriver He backs away gripping the
weapon ready for anything He tries to control his
breathing as he sits watches and waits

TRAP
A blood droplet hits the floor by his feet and PAYTON wipes
blood off his nose with confusion and a nervous frown

DISSOLVE THRU BLACK

INT REC ROOM - LATER

A pin-point of light appears at the end of a circular

Slowly the light grows as BOWER approaches and cautiously
steps through a doorway and into

A rec room with several rows of pool tables video games and
a ran-sacked bar The floor is heavily littered with broken
glass and BOWER wipes his finger across a wet surface on the
bar tasting it with an eye brow raised

I BOWER

(TO HIMSELF)
Open bar Gotta be E-deck

I
He climbs over the bar checks numerous cabinets only to
find
more broken glass and emptied containers About to give up
he pops open the last cabinet and

POW A FIGURE lunges out a direct HIT under his jaw sends
him backwards over a table The FIGURE jumps on top of him
jabbing a blade toward his neck He grabs the wrist just as
the tip begins to dig into his throat

BOWER (CONTD)

AAAAARRRRGF

A quick struggle ensues and just as BOWER is about to be

sliced open CRACK The ATTACKER is HIT and sent flying

TANAKA has come to his rescue twirling a pipe across his

palms The ATTACKER rolls to her feet to reveal NADIA

She snatches a pool ball off the table and throws it
directly

into TANAKAS chest

TANAKA

UUUGH

She rolls across the floor grabbing her knife and BOWER
BLINDS her with his flashlight raising the gun with a quick
whirl of the energy lever laser sights flaring brightly

BOWER

HOLD IT

BOWER ducks as a broken bottle WHIZZES past his face
smashing against the wall He raises the gun and
KA-RAAAACK A deliberate warning shot goes past NADIA and
HITS the bar SHATTERING every piece of glass thats near by
and NADIA and TANAKA are both blown off their feet
BOWER (CONTD)
Knock it off Both of ya
TANAKA and NADIA slowly recover both quickly try to find
their weapons on the floor

BOWER (CONTD)

Listen nobody needs to get hurt here

Both of you just cool out And stop

throwing that shit

Her eyes dart with uneasiness as she finds her knife

BOWER (CONTD)

Lets all just go easy here I
understand its been every man for
himself around here lately but if were
going to get out of this- A little God
damn solidarity wouldnt hurt

(MORE )

BOWER (CONTD)
We can work together here We all want
the same thing right
NADIA remains poised ready to fight knife raised Sighing
with defeat BOWER gestures hands raised as he motions for
TANAKA and they slowly back towards the door

BOWER (CONTD)
(motioning to Tanaka)
Thanks again
TANAKA motions toward the emblem on his uniform and gestures
to himself

BOWER (CONTD)
Yeah yeah I get it We can work
together on this right
TANAKA grins
BOWER (CONTD)
As long as we understand each other
They head out of the room as NADIA watches from the
shadows with a curious frown

CUT TO

checking their backs as they come to a sealed doorway
TANAKA is still wincing rubbing his chest with pain

TANAKA

BOWER
Yeah well no sympathy here She left
me with a few sore spots too pal
They both go to work attempting to wedge the door open with
pipes BOWER looks back to see NADIA They back pedal
with weapons in hand and NADIA is unaffected watching them
with a frown

BOWER (CONTD)
Listen lady We dont want any-

NADIA

(SOBERLY)

BOWER

NADIA

Youre part of the flight crew
BOWER

Malfunction of some sort-

NADIA
Gee you think Where are you going

BOWER

NADIA
You just wake up

BOWER

She eyes him over and TANAKA keeps the pipe raised

NADIA
Youll never make it

BOWER
Oh yeah And why is that

NADIA
Youre going the wrong direction

She grimaces and turns heading back up the corridor

and TANAKA exchange a look BOWER chases after her

BOWER
Hey Wait a second- HEY

NADIA

BOWER
Because I need you to show me the way

NADIA

She continues up the corridor and BOWER grabs her arm She
yanks away from his touch squaring off weapon in hand

BOWER
Hold on Please- Theres not much time
left before we lose everything onboard
You understand what Im trying to-

I NADIA
Do you know where this ship is headed

BOWER

NADIA

BOWER
(NOT SURE)
Sure
NADIA eyes him over sizing him up

NADIR
Ill get you as close to it as I can
But I wont wait for you

INT CORRIDOR ATRIUM - LATER

LIGHTS FLICKER past as

BOWER

NADIA leads them down a long corridor that widens into an
atrium of shafts going into the darkness in every direction
The further their lights pan across the shafts a strange
assortment of odd colored algae and moss is revealed growing

up the walls of the shafts
TANAKA keeps a watchful eye as BOWER frowns at the
surroundings

BOLTER
You know where youre going This
doesnt feel right

(NO RESPONSE)
How long have you been awake

NADIA
Dont know Theres no way to tell time
in here Two maybe three months

BOWER

MONTHS
His voice echoes across the cavernous atrium and she glares-

NADIA
Quiet You wanna get us killed

BOWER

(WHISPER)
How could you have- You telling me
people have been running around on board
for several months

NADIA
Longer I wasnt the first one up

HIGH ANGLE
Their flashlight beams continue across the enormous room
like
two small searchlights She leads them down into a side
shaft their lights fade from view

CUT TO
INT BIO-LAB VAULT DOOR ENTRANCE - LATER

NADIA stops at the foot of a large steel door gesturing for
them to crouch in the shadows watching the corridor

BOWER
Where are we going What are we doing-

NADIA
i Shush Were waiting

BOWER
Waiting for what-

NADIA
Quiet
At the far end of the corridor a faint BLUISH GLOW grows
stronger Shadows are moving growing closer

BOWER

SHIT-
NADIA gestures for them to stay put TANAKA wants to leave
but BOWER grabs his shoulder They both grip weapons
glancing to NADIA as the HUNTERS seem to be headed their

BOWER (CONT-D)
WE CANT-

NADIA
Ssssht
The HISS and CACKLES of the HUNTERS grow closer and it seems
theyre shortly going to be cornered and done for until
A SHUDDER is felt a FLICKER of LIGHTS approaching She goes
to a control panel holds down a switch and presses her palm
F across a scanner
As the power SURGE passes the control panel activates
scanning her hand and the steel door activates with a MOAN

hydraulics BOWER notices her ID tattoo BIO-T218076

The SHUDDER passes killing the power and the door stops
open only a half foot She squeezes through and BOWER and
TANAKA quickly follow They help her push it shut sealing
the lock with a CLANK

CUT TO
INT BIO-LAB VAULT - CONT

NADIA secures the lock on the door and jams a pipe in the
handles her own added insurance

BOWER
Who are they What the hell are those
things

NADIA

(shaking her head)

Never quite felt like sticking around to
find out Running is always the best
option Believe me

BOWER
Theyre not- They cant be from this
ship They dont seem human Do you

think something got on board or maybe

I something

He turns to follow her and pauses to see

The BIO-VAULT A large lab storage compartment that has been
lived-in for a long time A bed has been created from
assorted chair cushions and there is a collection of
scavenged items NADIA adds to the items dumping the
belongings of her bag onto the floor

BOWER is in awe as he approaches an entire wall of glass

tubes a maze of micro-biological containers glimmering
condensation

BOWER (CONT-D)
What is all this

NADIA
Ecological Development Embryonic
Charter Livestock and wildlife re-
population
The rows of glass tubes are labelled ranging from mountain
goats to octopi everything a new world would need

NADIA checks a few gauges on the wall of tubes and makes
adjustments on the monitoring system He senses her
meticulous care for the material

BOWER
Youve been living in here Youre
protecting it

NADIR
It seems to be the only living thing left
on this ship worth protecting
Regardless of the situation we still
have a mission Weve only lost about
thirty percent of the specimens mostly
reptilian class Never was big into
snakes anyway
BOWER doesnt share the attempt at humor wandering towards

darkened digital screen on the wall displaying a charted
graph of the new planet TANIS

BOWER
(under his breath)
Tanis

NADIA

(off his look)
You couldnt remember

BOWER
No I- I didnt remember just how far
away it is until now This was a

hundred and twenty-three year flight

NADIA begins to gather a few items shoving them into a bag
TANAKKA leans closer to the glass display with fascination
tapping the tubes to see movement inside

BOWER (CONTD)
How could I have forgotten that

NADIA
It comes only in pieces Even after a
few months I know everything about this
vault and its systems but I still
cant remember where I grew up Or my
brothers name Only pieces And the
training comes back first For good

reason I guess

BOWER eyes the darkened computer terminals portions of the
consoles coated in algae

BOWER
How could we have become like this in

only eight years

NADIA ponders the thought rotating her jaw She digs into

her supplies and tosses him a small block of orange
material

BOWER (CONTD)
What is this

NADIA
Dehydrated meatloaf House special I
save em for the weekends
BOWER sniffs it with a sneer and tries to break off a
piece hard as a rock

NADIA (CONTD)
Do you know how long it would take to
turn dehydrated meatloaf into that

BOWER

How long

NADIA
I dont know but it takes more then a
couple years to turn coal into fucking
diamonds

BOWER
You think weve over slept

NADIA
This ship was built to outlast our
with

childrens children and any engineer

could tell ya the warranty is running

out I think weve been asleep longer

then you may think

BOWER tosses the orange brick to TANAKA and he sniffs it

a grin breaking off a piece NADIA finishes gathering tools
and she slings the bag over her shoulder ready to go

BOWER
Do you have a radio

NADIA
(shaking her head)
Who the hell is there to call

BOWER
Im not the only flight crew officer
awake Were not in this alone

INT SLEEP CHAMBERCONTROL DESK - LATER

PAYTON is asleep seated on the floor back to the wall He
is awoken by

RATTLE THUMP THUMP

He instantly grips the pipe and turns on the flashlight The
SOUNDS are closer then ever before as something is heard
crawling towards the panel in the ventilation shaft

ANGLE ONCLOSE UP
A vent panel lightly RATTLES the metal begins to bend

PAYTON
You want in Come and get it you fu-
The screwdriver SNAPS and the panel hits the floor PAYTON
raises the pipe preparing to fight and A desperate gasp
is heard from inside the shaft

GALLO (0S)

Help me

PAYTON pauses angling the light inside to see GALLO a
young flight officer boyish innocence short-cropped hair
heavily coated in sweat desperation in his eyes His hair
is dark brown the only person without pure white hair

PAYTON
Who the hell are you
GALLO is tightly wedged inside the shaft squirming to crawl
out trembling with fear and exhaustion

GALLO
Help me- Im part- of the flight crew
Im- Please- HELP ME
PAYTON oddly hesitates before lowering the weapon He
digs into the shaft grabbing GALLOS hand pulling him out
GALLO collapses onto the floor crumbling into a fetal
position naked His hands are locked in claw-like grips
trembling uncontrollably His gasps are rapid and unsteady

PAYTON

Easy Easy Youre all right

PAYTON runs to grab a towel and water As he turns back he
notices GALLOS hip and legs are sprayed with dried blood
PAYTON kneels over him and GALLO spasms from his touch

GALLO
PAAARRRGH

PAYTON
EASY Im here to help you

PAYTON lifts the bottle to his lips but the water runs down
his face GALLO is frozen in shock
PAYTON (CONTD)

GALLO is unresponsive wide eyes locked in a trance

PAYTON (CONTD)
Whats your name Huh Can you hear me

PAYTON frowns mumbling the name with a hint of recognition

PAYTON (CONTD)

GALLO

(TREMBLING)
Yes sir

PAYTON
Where did you come from Gallo

GALLO
The bridge
Saying the words seems to send him into a terrified trance

PAYTON

The more PAYTON inquires the more GALLO begins to unravel
emotionally His eyes widen with terror breath quickening
PAYTON (CONTD)
Corporal

GASP GASP GASP

GALLO is hyper-ventilating eyes wide with terror A droplet
of blood slowly builds in his nostril refusing to drip A
low whine is heard in his throat as LIGHTS FLICKER past

into

a ventilation shaft Twenty feet inside the shaft the walls

are collapsed blocking passage NADIA sighs with dread

NADIA

Personnel Keep your light down

She leads the way along the wall and into a compartment of
unimaginable size fifty foot high steel walls that channel
through the room The walls are lined with hundreds of sleep
chambers stacked ten high on either side
They round a corner into the main atrium to see dishevelled
equipment and smashed control consoles scarred from battle
Old blood stains are worn deeply into the floor

BOWER
Jesus
As they venture deeper inside they see numerous sleep-
chambers open hatches and empty The further they move
along the wall more and more empty pods too many to count

BOWER (CONTD)
My God Theyre empty Theyre all-
Where the hell is everyone

NADIA
Keep quiet

I
As the dozens and dozens of nameplates move past his
flashlight BOWER pauses

BOWER
Wait a second My wife-

NADIA
Keep moving

BOWER
No wait My wife could be in here
BOWERS focus completely shifts turning towards the pods
reading name plates

NADIA
What does she do Whats her specialty

BOWER
Shes not part of the crew but spouses

NADIA quickly continues as BOWER tries to keep up

BOWER
Do you know where the family members are-

NADIA

Quiet

They look to see TANAKA has fallen behind crouched and
peering off towards the dark Hes poised like a dog on the
prowl thats caught a bad scent They crouch and crawl to
the adjacent corner

BOWER
I dont see what hes looking at do you

NADIA
We have to keep moving We dont want to
stay out in the open for too long
Especially in here

BOWER

(TO TANAKA)
Hey Lets go
Distant THUMPS are heard somewhere in the room and they
tighten up with their weapons eyes scanning TANAKA refuses
to look away poised like a hunter

NADIA
We cant stay herel
NADIA heads across the main floor and BOWER tries to wave
on but TANAKA is locked onto something refusing to waver

BOWER
Lets get out of here Comon-
The THUMPS grow louder and TANAKA heads into the shadows
BOWER hesitates turning to follow NADIA through a barricade
of dishevelled equipment leaving TANAKA behind

for loading passengers darkened and in shambles NADIA is
scanning the corridors ahead choosing her path as BOWER
rushes to catch her

Then you wait and find your own way

and narrowing tunnel BOWER hesitates with frustration
Having to choose he turns and chases after NADIA

I They crawl through a maze of machinery and NADIAS pace is
difficult for BOWER to keep up

BOWER
Wait Im coming-
Theres a CRUNCH under his foot He lowers his light
picking up a small white object He brings it closer to the
light to realize its A HUMAN FINGER BONE

BOWER (CONTD)

NADIA turns toward him to see

REVERSE ANGLE
Behind BOWER is a massive stack of human skeletons and
carcasses Theyve just crawled into a pit of human remains
They both back away with horror only to see a mountain of
carcasses on both sides The only route is upward and they
begin to crawl up the slope on their bellies over dead
remains

BOWER (CONTD)

My God Wait- Where are we going

NADIA suddenly grabs him a quick jerk to silence him A
SHADOW passes with a CACKLING HISS They freeze laying on
rafter

see

the

top of the remains the bones CRINKLING underneath them
The HISS grows stronger and they look up to see a
silhouetted HUNTER crouched over like a gargoyle ona

leering in their direction
NADIA

(WHISPER)
Dont move
They try to remain motionless but the slope of the remains
i CRINKLES underneath them and the hill of remains begins to
slide The HISS grows stronger
They hold their position until a SHUDDER approaches with
FLICKERING LIGHTS The power surge is enough to ignite a
small landslide underneath them

BOWER

SHIT-
NADIA grabs his arm as bones snap and they slide helplessly
to the bottom within a landslide of bones and flesh
The finally slide to a stop at the bottom of the slope and
BOWER quickly raises his weapon towards the rafters to

the HUNTER is gone
NADIA

(WHISPER)
Where did it go-
He pans the light and ROAR The HUNTER lunges at them
from five feet away BOWER is STRUCK with enough force to
send him flying CRASHING into a pile of bones
NADIA spins around with a bladed pipe in her hands but

HUNTER is already gone She spins back and THWAP Shes
HIT from behind and sent with break-neck force into the
floor The HUNTER pounces onto her back and a claw-like hand
grabs her hair teeth opening towards her neck and

POW BOWER charges into the HUNTER tackling it and they
spin into a brutal and distorted fight seen under the
FLICKERING LIGHT Even though the HUNTER is a smaller oneof
the pack smaller then BOWER its speed and strength is in-
human It grabs BOWER by the head with a GROWL and

slowly

continual

shadows

by

THWACK TANAKA lunges out of the shadows delivering a blow
with his bladed pipe into the HUNTERS face Its a hit that
would normally kill anything nearly taking its head off
The HUNTER stumbles staggers and HIIIISSSSSST It HITS
TANAKA sending him airborne nearly knocking him out
Under the FLICKERING LIGHT BOWER NADIA and TANAKA all
attack the lone HUNTER taking all three of them to bring it
to the floor They viciously pound it with pipes and blades
until it finally stops flinching beneath them
Its pale white skin seeps a thick black colored blood The
three of them back away gasping and coated in its blood

BOWER

(GASPING)
Jesus Christ- Jesus-
Its face is smashed beyond recognition but its facial
features are horrifically distorted no sign of eyes under
the shredded tissue

BOWER (CONTD)
What the what the hell is it
The HUNTER flinches and our gang back pedals with fright

NADIA continues back pedalling looking towards the rafters
to see HEFLIN silhouetted leering towards them

NADIA

ANOTHER ONE-
BOWER quickly finds his weapon on the floor and HEFLIN

begins to TAP his spear against the wall echoing a
clank through the hull
BOWER
What is he doing
BOWER NADIA and TANAKA quickly realize the effect as
begin to move the room is filling with HUNTERS alerted

the tapping of metal

NADIA

A low gargled HISS is heard from HEFLINS throat
NADIA is already gone BOWER and TANAKA chase after her as
the walls come to life HUNTERS swarming onto their path

a pack of wild dogs
Before diving through the barricade BOWER looks back to see
HEFLIN and his pack have paused to eat the fallen HUNTER

through the barricade and run back into the main corridor of

They round a corner and NADIA jumps inside an empty sleep-
chamber frantically trying to pull the hatch closed TANAKA
follows suite jumping inside another chamber and BOWER
scrambles in search of an open door as footsteps are heard
quickly approaching

In a frenzied panic BOWER dives into the chamber with

tugging the hatch closed

BOWER and NADIA are cheek to cheek in the cramped space

gasping for breath and dripping sweat with terror
Through the porthole silhouetted HUNTERS move past with
weapons in hand search and destroy style One HUNTER steps
up only a few feet from their porthole and they freeze
holding their breath Slowly the HUNTERS continue past the
shadows slowly fading from sight

the hell are those things

Shut-up

They listen for a long moment hearing nothing as BOWER
looks at his hand finger tips trembling

The hatch door inches open and BOWER peeks out He and NADIA
crawl out quietly to see TANAKA waiting for them

TANAKA

BOWER
I second that Lets get the fuck out of
here Which way did we come from

NADIA
You want to go back

BOWER
No I mean lets just go

NADIA
We should go back Find a different
path I dont think we can get through
to the reactor bay from-

BOWER
You said there was no other path
NADIA
Im ready to explore other options-

BOWER
Which way did they go-

NADIA

You really want to discuss it here

A RUMBLE is heard approaching and they all crouch in unison

Its a power surge that sends FLICKERING LIGHTS across the

massive corridor and a BLINKING LIGHT is activated on a

nearby sleep-chamber And then

BANG The hatch door is KICKED from the inside white gas

erupting from the seam Our gang quickly crawls toward the

shadows crouching behind equipment to watch as

Another KICK bursts open the hatch and a BIG PASSENGER
crawls

out slamming onto the floor with a shiver of agony gasping
for breath muscles twitching

BIG PASSENGER
AAAAAARGH

The BIG PASSENGER tries to get to his feet gasping and
heaving mumbling in Russian BOWER tries to stand but NADIA
pulls him back

NADIA
What are you doing-

BOWER
Theyll hear him- Theyll- Weve got to

HELP HIM-
Footsteps thunder across the floor and WHACK The BIG
PASSENGER is STRUCK by a single blow from HEFLIN The
HUNTERS have returned in full force and they come out of the
shadows from every direction bladed weapons spinning
intervene

BOWER pulls away from NADIAS grip and prepares to

but TANAKA suddenly grabs him holding him back with force
With the BIG PASSENGER wounded and moaning on the floor the
HUNTERS gather in a circle in ceremonial fashion praying
thanks for the feast the ship has presented

They watch helplessly as the BIG PASSENGER is then brutally
attacked and eaten alive WEASEL leads other HUNTERS under
the flickering light in a demented and twisted celebratory
dance a frenzy of pure evil

This attack is heard more then it is seen under flickering
lights obscured view and most of the camera angles on Bower
and the groups reactions

Frozen in horror BOWER is tugged by TANAKA following NADIA
to the corner where shes lifted a grate in the floor They
climb into a shaft under the floor and into the dark as

on a nearby bunk He hesitates holding the pipe as a
weapon tucking it away and cautiously approached GALLO for

closer inspection

He feels his neck for a pulse He notices the dried blood
under his nose then gently pulls aside the blanket to see
GALLOS identification tattoo reading FLT004012

He glances up to see GALLO is now awake staring at him

GALLO

GALLO narrows his eyes pulling the blanket tighter

To make sure youre alright You

GALLO deepens his frown glancing around with
disorientation

PAYTON (CONTD)

GALLO shifts his eyes back on him a bad topic

GALLO

Yeah So

PAYTON
Where are we I cant get guidance off

this system and I have no idea where-

GALLO
I dont know

PAYTON
Well what did you see How did--

GALLO
Listen Im not a navigator Stars all

Sensing GALLO is about to break down again PAYTON tries a
calmer approach

PAYTON
Easy I just want to make sure
GALLOS hands are trembling uncontrollably

PAYTON (CONTD)
-youre okay-
GALLO tucks his shaking hands under the blanket
defensively

GALLO
Im fine
PAYTON lowers his stare hesitating glancing across the
dried blood still splattered across his legs

PAYTON

Is this your blood Corporal
GALLO

Some of it is sir
PAYTON

Whose blood is it
GALLOholds his stare jaw muscles tightening

GALLO
They didnt give me any choice

PAYTON

GALLO
There was something wrong with them

PAYTON

Off his stare he understands the implication

PAYTON (CONT D )

Of the worst sort They were- I

PAYTON goes to a nearby compartment popping open a First-
Aid
case inside is a pistol-gripped syringe He turns back and
GALLO squares off clenched fists

GALLO
What are you doing What is that

PAYTON
Its just a sedative Help you relax-
GALLO lifts his fists with a threatening posture

GALLO
Then you take it and relax
PAYTON backs off setting the syringe aside

PAYTON

INT SUB-LEVEL SHAFT - LATER

A FLICKER of LIGHT passes to reveal BOWER crouched inside
a three-foot high narrow passageway a crawl space beneath

steel grated floor He follows the tunnel into a large silo
lined with octagonal filters

TANAKA and NADIA are both looking for a way out jabbing
pipes into the grate overhead unable to budge it

BOWER
Didnt we come through here already

NADIA
We gotta find a way out

BOWER
Out Why did we come iii-

NADIA
I was trying to get us out of there alive-

BOWER
I thought you knew where you were going

NADIA
I was trying to save our asses-

BOWER
Couldve mentioned that after the first
mile If I would have known wed be
doing laps down here-

She angrily turns towards him pipe in her hand

NADIA
I didnt need to help you at all You
and the Hong-Kong Express would still be
playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if
it werent for me

Their heightening confrontation is halted by

TANAKA

HIIISSST ( and whispered Japanese)

They pause to hear CLASSICAL MUSIC echoing from below

BOWER
What the hell is that

They climb down the shaft jumping from filter to filter
one level they follow the sound into a shaft opening and

towards the soft warm GLOW of YELLOW LIGHT

They reach an open hatch peering inside to see

At

Inside an empty storage tank a comfortable living space has
onto

been created numerous chairs surround a make-shift dinner
table made from storage crates with hand-made candles and
various food containers The tank appears empty

with uncertainty They crawl through the hatch

INT TANK - CONT

They climb into the empty tank lined with valves and
filtration screens The music is playing from crackling
speakers hidden in the darkened circular catwalk overhead
TANAKA goes straight for the food and as soon as NADIA steps
through the hatch a wire SNAPS Levers clank and a mouse-
trap has triggered SLAMMING the hatch closed Trapped
They instantly turn back to the door yanking and tugging in
a panic BOWER pans his light towards the catwalk only to
see a FIGURE (LELAND) scampering through the shadows
Another lever is turned and FOOOOOSH A stream of vapor
shoots out of several vents along the wall The colorless
gas hits them and they instantly gag choking for air

With the slanted walls of the tank there seems to be no
escape but TANAKA runs up the wall diving and grabbing

a pipe climbing upward toward the catwalk
The shadowed FIGURE (LELAND) quickly hobbles to the railing

LELAND
No no no Back in der big boy

LELAND uses a spear to jab TANAKAS hand He loses his grip
and tumbles back to the bottom of the tank BOWER pulls
NADIR out of the way of the hatch

BOWER
Get back BACK

BOWER whirls the magneto lever on the weapon and he raises
the barrel towards the hatch nearly point blank
KA-CRAAAACK The energy blast from the weapon hits the hatch
like a lightening bolt sending a tremendous JOLT through the
entire tank A spark IGNITES the chemical gas and theres a
BURST of flammable gas that rolls upward into the catwalks
LELAND is knocked off his feet and he GASPS with shock

LELAND
Whoa WHOA What the hell was that
LELAND is exposed from his hiding place waving the smoke
from his face bewildered Hes an older man whos lost all
vanity over survival A thin-framed spidery little man with
assorted clothing and a clutter of tools on his belt

LELAND (CONTD)
What did you do
BOWER whirls the lever on the weapon and points it at him

BOWER
Shut off the gas

LELAND

Where did you get that

BOWER angles the barrel towards a vent blowing out the
chemical gas and LELAND jumps with fright

LELAND (CONTD)
NO-NO HO-HO

BOWER
SHUT IT OFF
LELAND scampers across the catwalk and quickly lifts levers
and twists nozzles shutting off the flow of chemical gas
His frown transforms to a grin raising an eye brow as he

stares into the barrel of BOWERS weapon

calculating then a grin

been something that crawled out of

NADIA
No Thats not possible

BOWER
Then something got on board Some kind

NADIA
Or something that was already on board

What does that mean

NADIR
it could have been the accelerator

PAYTON refuses to look to GALLO continuing his work

GALLO (CONTD)
Its already dead You really believe
that kid will be able to save this ship

PAYTON
He can do it

GALLO
Twelve hours ago he didnt know his own
name Now you think hes ready to re-
configure a nuclear reactor

PAYTON refuses to give him eye contact continuing to work

the computer as G ALLO paces back and forth in front of the
sleep chambers fingers rapidly twitching at his side

Hes the only shot we have Gotta have a
little faith

actually say that with a straight face

INT SLEEP CHAMBER COMPARTMENT - CONT
The GLOW of the HUNTERS slowly begins to fade from sight as
BOWER notices what hes hiding behind is an empty sleep
chamber coated with dried blood and signs of violence He
looks to the labelled name plates with a frown and wanders
deeper into the room

NADIA follows him with a frown as LELAND and TANAKA remain
poised with weapons near the doorway

BOWERS walk slows as he moves past rows of sleep chambers
nearly all of them have been opened and signs of violent
deaths left dried and splattered across the floor

NADIA
What are you doing What is it

BOWER

(DAZED)
These were family members of flight
personnel

NADIA

FAMILY OF-

She notices BOWER is holding EVALONS photo and glances to
the row of empty chambers slowly realizing his grief

NADIA (CONTD)
You think shes here

BOWER
Shes not here Shes dead

NADIA
How do you know for sure She could be-

BOWER
Shes not on this flight She wouldnt
come with me She wouldnt marry me
(sigh of disgust)

Thats why I came There was nothing

left for me there She stayed on Earth

Gone with everyone else And I left

because of her

His gaze begins to gloss over taking it all in

NADIA
Well then she saved your life
BOWER frowns on the thought slowly nodding in agreement
His eyes look to the label of the chamber he was led to the
label reads M PAYTON He mumbles to himself memory
returning

BOWER

back and forth near the sleep chambers

GALLO

Hes right about one thing Once that

thing shuts down were as good as dead
Nothing on this ship will ever turn on
again Ever Not the air not the

lights the heat not even the pods
escape launch systems

PAYTON refuses to look up from the computer

What are you saying

GALLO
Imizgâsaying once its done Were
done But we still have a way out of
this before its too late

PAYTON

What are you suggesting Corporal

GALLO
We can still launch ourselves in the
pods Before the ignition systems are
completely dead sir

PAYTON
Launching ourselves into deep space
when we dont even know where we are We
wouldnt last more then a few days inside
those things Thats suicide-

GALLO
A few days is better then what we have
left here Ill take my chances How
long do you think that reactor has been
sitting That thing could melt-down when
he tries to fire the core This ship
could be ripped in half-

PAYTON
Stand down Corporal Were not going to
abandon anything and were not going to
leave them behind-

GALLO
We cant stay on this ship You know
that as well as I do-

PAYTON
I said stand down Corporal Thats an
order
GALLO steps up behind PAYTON his face revealed with a thin
stream of blood oozing from under his nose dripping off his
chin eyes hollow and pale PAYTON refuses to look at him

LELAND (CONTD)
Youre crazy You cant-

NADLA
Shut-up Move
LELAND stays behind watching as they begin a perilous
descent down the walls of the reactor bay wall Clinging
onto the pipes and railings of the catwalks the odd-colored
algae grows more and more dense a dim glow slowly coming
into view from below
With a gap in the catwalk BOWER leaps across nearly losing
his grip He looks down to see an odd pattern of white
shapes near the bottom

Squinting into the darkness hes unable to make out what
hes looking at and he manages to crawl down further
reaching a gangplank that crosses to the towering reactor
He motions for NADIA and TANAKA to stay put and begins
crawling across towards a darkened control panel

LELAND is nervously watching from above leaning further

the railing and a pen-lamp slips free from his belt

The pen-lamp CLANKS off one of the catwalks and tumbles past
BOWER dropping to the bottom hitting the floor and
illuminating the strange white objects covering the floor
as DOZENS of HUNTERS all sleeping Their pale white
bodies are intertwined and over-lapped resembling an orgy of
the living dead

BOWER

CHRIST ALMIGHTY-
The fall of the pen-lamp causes one HUNTER to instantly
spring to its feet lifting its nose towards the air like a
guard dog checking the scent
BOWER remains frozen gripping the gangplank that hangs
twenty feet above the field of sleeping HUNTERS
I Slowly the HUNTER returns to sleep slithering its way

into the folds of flesh and BOWER continues his crawl
across reaching the control panel

Upon seeing the sleeping HUNTERS LELAND fearfully backs
away exiting the room NADIA and TANAKA grip the ladders
watching BOWER holding their breath in fright

BOWER grabs a vine but it breaks away and he dangles over
the side losing his grip NADIA jumps across the gap and
climbs down extending her weapon for him to grab Together
they cling to the side of the reactor and BOWER taps the

toward his direction and TANAKA throws his weapon HITTING
one of the HUNTERS directly in the head

TANAKA jumps to the neighboring catwalk and breaks through a
hatch coated with vines and vegetation HEFLIN screeches a
command and the HUNTERS ignite in a chain-reaction grabbing
their weapons and taking chase like a swarm of attack dogs

The tremendous ROAR of rushing water rolls them down the
stairwell and into the sleep chamber compartment in a raging

exterior hull of the massive space ship slides past at a

rate of speed with a swirl of ocean water and bubbles

BAM The pod SLAMS into something as SPARKS fly and seals
are ruptured as WATER sprays in with a blinding BLAST The
chamber is sent into another violent roll as NADIA and BOWER
tumble head over feet as if caught within a washing

The chamber finally steadies as water washes across the
control panel one last burst of sparks knocks out the
lights taking them into BLACK

Only their gasps are heard as they squirm towards the upper
corner only a foot of air remaining

He grabs the mask connected to tubes in the side and pulls
the straps over her head

She chokes on the air and struggles to orientate herself
