INT BOARDING SCHOOL -- NIGHT

Inside the corridor that contains the boys rooms its
empty and quiet

Footsteps are heard and a SCHOOLMASTER walks past the
camera down the corridor He checks whether all the
lights in the rooms are out

As he walks past a room we reveal an eye peeping out
then his face Rohan

He waits till the schoolmaster has reached the end of the
corridor and turned off down another one He slowly comes
out of his room Muninder Vikram and Benoy follow him
out All of them are wearing casual clothes

The four of them tiptoe down the corridor down the main
staircase down another corridor and come up to a closed
door Muninder opens it slightly and peeks out

His POV The empty school yard

Satisfying themselves that the coast is clear they open
the door

EXT BOARDING SCHOOL -- NIGHT

One by one they come out into the open very careful not
to let the door slam back into place

They sit next to a pillar and scan the grounds
Around them the imposing facade of the boarding school

All the windows are dark except one A shadow walks
around inside that room

on to Vikram who takes a drag and passes it on to Benoy
who passes it to Muninder without looking When he does
he finds Muninder staring at him

concentrating on the film The cigarette makes it’s way

something beyond him He nudges Rohan

He whistles provocatively No response He throws some
popcorn and whistles again The man turns to look at

the main street He starts running on the pavement
Bhairav is still close to him and he’s catching up
Around them are cars people stalls Everything blurs
by It’s almost like an obstacle course Diving and
getting out of people’s ways

Rohan moves off the pavement onto the clearer main road
Bhairav follows him

Rohan runs for his life but Bhairav is slowly gaining

He almost catches up with Rohan but Rohan uses all his
energy and puts a little bit extra into it

His feet pound the street
He starts pulling away from Bhairav

A smile breaks out on his face

Bhairav loses ground
Rohan runs like the wind
Bhairav stops running

Rohan realises that Bhairav isn’t behind him anymore and
he stops

He looks behind
Bhairav is far away
A huge smile breaks on Rohan’s face He’s finally free

He raises his hands in the air like a champion boxer
mainly to taunt Bhairav

Bhairav stands at the end of the street and gives him a
dark look He turns and walks back home

Rohan sees him turn and slowly the smile fades from his
face

ROHAN (VO)
Aur kissi bhi haalat mein doonga aapko
aapki nayee shaadi nayee family nayee

beti mubaarak ho aapka beta Rohan

They walk on

Fade out

The End
