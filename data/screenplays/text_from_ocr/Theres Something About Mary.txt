Ted has been telling all this to no one

TED (contd)
It took me half the summer to pay off all
those bets
(sighs)
I never did see Mary again That was about
twelve years ago

Just then the door quietly opens and Teds PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes
back into the room and takes his seat (He has a dab of mustard on
his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his
collar)

PSYCHIATRIST
Uh-huh Interesting

The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin
then tosses it aside

TED
Anyway its not something you exactly
forget about but I guess I mustve blocked
it out of my head Then about a week ago
Im driving on the highway and I got to
thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldnt
breatheI couldnt keep up with the flow
of traffic anymore I felt like I was
going to die I pulled into a rest area
parked the car and just started shaking

The Psychiatrist scratches his chin

PSYCHIATRIST
You knowrest areas are homosexual
hang-outs

TED
Huh

PSYCHIATRIST

Highway rest areas--theyre the bathhouses
of the nineties for some gay men

vestibule

HEALY

phone RINGS He stares at it for TWO THREE FOUR RINGS
Panic-stricken Then he answers it

BACK ON MARY - as she lowers herself onto the couch

MARY
(stunned)
What
TUCKER

Ive got a friend in the Boston police
department He faxed me this this morning
Ill just give you the highlights

(reading from rap sheet)
After a short stint as a petty thief
Patrick R Healy graduated to armed robbery
by the age of fourteen At sixteen he
committed his first murder--a pretty
teachers aid named Molly Pettygrove He
was incarcerated until age twenty-two when
despite a grim psychological profile the
state was forced to release him In his
mid-twenties and again in his early
thirties he was suspected of homicides in
the states of Utah and Washington
Unfortunately the bodies were so badly
decomposed that there wasnt enough
evidence to hold him and on and on and so
forth and so on
Mary looks like shes going to throw up
ON HEALY - he listens intently his face ashen

MARY (VO)
Holy shit

MAGDA (VO)
Puffy get over here

We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dogs nails on the floor then a
LOUD THUMP followed by a YELP

Mary looks fondly at Tucker

MARY

Healy grabs Tucker by the neck

other down Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom
with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head Healy does a double-take
then looks back at the snake
