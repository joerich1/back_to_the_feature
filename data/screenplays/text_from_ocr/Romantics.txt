EXT VICTORIAN HOUSE

A charming Victorian house sits on the end of a New
England street Faded pink paint black shutters--very
picturesque

INT HOUSE-LIVING ROOM

Seven college students sleep scattered throughout the
living room--some are nestled on the sofa in pairs
others are passed out in front of the TV Bottles
strewn clothes and general mess give evidence to last
night’s festivities Morning light sifts through the
window and lands on the eyes of one sleeping brunette a
beauty with a furrowed brow LAURA opens her eyes

LAURA
Shit

She turns to the boy curled up beside her on the sofa

LAURA (CONTD)
Shit Tom Wake up

TOM is a muss of bed-head and puppy-ish green eyes
He opens his eyes smooths the frown on Laura’s forehead
kisses it then falls back asleep

LAURA (CONTD)
Li wake up

A cascade of blond hair heralds the awakening of LILA LILA
What time is it

Laura stands stumbles across the room finds a clock
buried under a pair of jeans

LAURA
HOLY SHIT Everyone Wake up

Fourteen eyes are now wide open

WEESIE
Oh my God

LILA

INT BATHROOM

Laura and Lila arrive in the bathroom furiously brush
their teethLila puts toothpaste on both toothbrushes
while Laura ransacks a cupboard for mouthwash Standing
side by side the two girls betray their intricate
chemistry They are yin and yang control and chaos two

halves of one whole

LAURA
I haven’t written a word

LILA

You haven’t written a word
(hiding her concern) Well that’s
when you’re best Off the cuff
and from the heart

LAURA
Six thousand people parents

He is fighting nausea
Weesie strides out of her room fully dressed

WEESIE
Oh sweetie you okay

JAKE

She throws her arms around him they kiss for a moment
but nausea overwhelms Jake

JAKE (CONTD)

The door opens PETE emerges from the bathroom in
his towel a handsome athletic specimen Jake pushes
past Pete slams the door shut Pete and Weesie squelch
a laugh as they hear gagging sounds

Ladies

INT LIVING ROOM

Downstairs all seven are nearly assembled pulling on
last articles of clothing brushing hair Tom turns to
face Laura There’s that frown again

TOM

She smiles and relaxes at his cue

LAURA
I’m so nervous

TOM

She smiles

TOM (CONTD)

They kiss And as quickly as they woke up all seven
sprint out of the house

EXT STREET

They race down the leafy New England street running in
single file

EXT QUAD

Now they’re running seven abreast on a grassy campus
towards the camera Somehow they look formidable like
seven superheroes about to take flight

EXT GRADUATION

But they stop suddenly alarmed by a distant sound--a
swell of applause They look up to find a sea of BLACK
CAPS rise into the air They’ve missed their own
graduation They watch crestfallen

Tom puts his arm around Laura

TRIPLER
Does that mean we have to stay
here another year

PETE
Nah Just for the rest of our
lives

DISSOLVE TO

THIS SAME IMAGE NOW METICULOUSLY FRAMED HANGS NEATLY ON

A BEDROOM WALL

PULL BACK TO

REVEAL

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

The framed photograph is surrounded by other vibrant
black-and-white images Together the photos create a
living collage that tells us as much about the
photographer as her subject

Lila Hayes now ten years older taps one of these
photographs into place It was crooked but now it’s
perfect Satisfied she continues through her room with
the cheerful ordinance of a marching band conductor
dust before she exits the room we land on a BULLETIN
BOARD It is delightfully laden with colorful SWATCHES
and TEAR-SHEETS BLUE AND GREEN RIBBON WHITE PEONIES
AN ENGRAVED INVITATION IN BROWN INK--a symphony of
planning It’s Lila’s wedding day

e HF FH
INT CAR-DAY

Four more of the magic seven sit in a BEAT-UP VOLVO
They look olderthan last we saw them of course but
more noticeably they look a little less optimistic
Tripler and Pete sit in the front He’s driving she’s
fidgeting with the window Up Down Up Down He
shoots her a look She stops

Jake and Weesie sit in the back She’s sleeping with her
head on his shoulder while Jake reads a book

EXT FERRY

The volvo is parked among many other cars on a ferry off
the Maine coast The car door opens and we follow
Tripler as she walks to the deck She looks out to a
vista of pine trees rocky coast and sparkling ocean

INT HAYES LIVING ROOM-DAY

LILA HAYES floats through a grand living room
checking for imperfections--fluffing pillows
straightening books making this perfect world even more
perfect Her mother Augusta and younger sister
Minnow sit on a tufted sofa They sit in tense
silence A finger taps a foot twitches

Suddenly a knock All three race to the door Lila
wins and seizes the expected PACKAGE She opens it with
her bare hands with the grace and speed of an ambulance
worker Finally the box gives way A white satin dress
emerges Then it’s gone again as Lila dashes upstairs
Minnow trails her but a door slams in her face when she
reaches the attic

EXT DIRT DRIVEWAY

A REARVIEW MIRROR reveals a familiar furrowed brow

An I-PHONE’s map reveals the driver has reached her
destination ‘you are here” So why isn’t she moving

Laura sits in a parked car at the end of a long dirt
driveway She checks her reflection sighs and smooths
the crease on her forehead She rearranges a messy
middle part She checks it hates it replaces the
original look A honk interrupts her meditation

The VOLVO pulls up to her left so that both fenders are
even

PETE

INT LAURA’S CAR

Tripler settles into Laura’s car grabs Laura’s bag
frantically rifles through it

TRIPLER
Had to get out of there
Desperate situation

LAURA

TRIPLER
I ran out of cigarettes in

Portsmouth

Tripler empties Laura’s bag--money pens lip gloss

LAURA

college

TRIPLER
Fuck off You’ve got to be
kidding

She locates a box of TIC TACS empties the whole box into
her mouth

LAURA
You didn’t pass any gas stations
in the last hundred miles

TRIPLER
Pete wouldn’t let me stop He
wants me to detox before we start
trying

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
Trying Holy shit That’s so
exciting
TRIPLER

Please The only thing I’m
willing to nurse is a hangover

Laura wrinkles her nose

LAURA
Maybe work on that one

They burst out laughing then pause and get a good look
at each other

TRIPLER
Oh my God I’m so happy to see
you

LAURA

I’m so happy to see you too
They hug pull back stare at each other some more

TRIPLER
You okay

LAURA

TRIPLER

WEESIE
Honey you didn’t do so bad

Pete eyes Jake You’re in for it buddy

JAKE
Sweetie the day we met--

WEESIE
It was night-time honey

JAKE
Two am on September 18 1996
when you asked if you could borrow
the ketchup at the Tasty was the
luckiest day--sorry the luckiest
night--of my life a night that
will be surpassed only by October
5 of this year when you finally
accept my hand in marriage

Weesie smiles satisfied Pete eyes his friend Nice
save

EXT DRIVEWAY

The cars continue up the long dirt drive Elms forma
canopy overhead and then without warning sunshine And
an unobstructed view of the ocean

EXT THE HAYES ESTATE DAY

The cars roll to a stop in front of Lila Hayes’ family’s
formidable seaside estate It’s a white dove of a house
on a plum piece of land that slopes down to the water
All is abuzz as the house is prepped for the wedding

Car doors open Passengers stumble out Lila emerges
from the house resplendent She is the ultimate hostess-

-sunny welcoming and confident

LILA
You’re here

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
We’re here

LILA
Hooray

Hugs smiles kisses all around

The girls

TRIPLER
It’s Pete’s fault we’re late He
drove like my grandmother

PETE
Trip’s just bitter ‘cause her
license got revoked

TRIPLER
It didn’t get revoked It expired

WEESIE
(to Lila) They’ve been doing this
for the last eight hours

LILA
Glad to see nothing ever changes

surround Lila and commence the ritual

assessment of each other’s looks

TRIPLER
(to Lila) You disgusting whore
LAURA
Completely vile
WEESIE
Every wretched inch
TRIPLER
Youve never looked worse in your
life
WEESIE
We’re talking like freshman fall
LILA
(delicious smile) You think
TRIPLER
We know
LILA
Really

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
You look beautiful

Lila smiles bashful pleased

TRIPLER
Yeah yeah We’1ll have plenty of
time to kiss your ass at the
rehearsal dinner

Laughter more hugs It’s perfectly clearthese friends
are happiest when they’re together

Lila springs to help the guests with their bags but the
boys rush to attention They hoist the bags to their
shoulders while the girls link arms and head onto the
lawn Laura and Lila fall behind so they can catch up in
private

LAURA
Li

LILA

Lo

They stop hug stare at other for a moment These girls
share a powerful bond the telepathy and intensity of
sisters

LAURA
So

ILA
So

LAURA
So how’s it all going

ILA

Piece of cake I don’t understand
why brides get so worked up

Laura smiles at Lila’s nonchalance Clearly an act but
endearing nonetheless

ILA (CONTD)
Did you pick up your dress

LAURA
Yes of course

sILA
And you wrote a good toast

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
I think so

LILA
And you remembered something blue

Laura touches a SAPPHIRE STUD in her ear
LILA (CONTD)

Thank you And you didn’t want to
bring the new guy

LAURA
Neh It’s so much more fun just
us

Lila checks Laura’s eyes They smile walk a few steps
in silence

ILA
I confess I’ve been worried about
the bridesmaids

LAURA
Why

sILA
I just want you guys to feel
beautiful in your dresses

LAURA
How could we not feel beautiful in
such a flattering color

Laura pauses

ILA
That was passive-aggressive

LAURA
And your comment was

ILA
Totally innocent

They take a couple steps in silence On any other day
this might turn into a spat But today all is forgiven

Lila stops takes it all in
LILA (CONTD)

My God It’s like time hasn’t
passed

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
I know

But this means something different to both girls

sILA
I’m so glad you’re here

LAURA
I’m glad I’m here too

sILA
You are Honestly Truly

LAURA
Yes Of course

Lila stares at Laura A fraught moment passes

LILA
Good Because I couldn’t do this
without you

LAURA

Are you kidding You’re gonna have
to throw me out of the car when
you guys leave forwhere are you
goingBora Bora

They squeal hug lLaura’s doing her best But we can
see it in her eyes This ain’t easy

EXT DARK HARBOR TENNIS COURT-DAY

Tom stands at the baseline of a manicured tennis
court playing a cut-throat game of doubles The puppy-
ish cutie has grown into a gorgeousguy--tall athletic
debonair and illogically unsettled

His doubles partner is Minnow Their opponents are
Lila’s father William and Lila’s brother Chip Tom misses an opportunity to win the point
thrashing the ball into the net Did he do it on
purpose

TOM
Sorry Minnow My bad

CHIP
Tom you’re bringing my poor
sister down

MINNOW
What’s with you today Champ

(CONTTNURFD )

TOM

Sorry guys I’m distracted
Just thinking about my toast

MR HAYES
Wise man You’ve got a tough act
to follow

CHIP

Fingers crossed Dad that you’ll
tell the story of how Lila learned
to ride a bike

MINNOW
Can I serve

Minnow serves and the point begins Tom returns
gracefully

CHIP
(while playing) Minnow if you
play your cards right I’11 sneak
you some booze tonight

MINNOW
Oh wow That would be a first

TOM
Glad to see you’re still
contributing to the corruption of

minors

CHIP
At least I’m contributing to
society

MINNOW

Chip stop talking I know what
you’re up to

Tom sets up for a volley but ‘accidentally’ hits it out

MINNOW (CONT’D)
Tom

CHIP
Game and set

TOM
Well-played Gentlemen

Tom begins to pack up his gear He has intentionally

thrown the game in order to excuse himself Minnow
glares at Tom--she’s onto him

(CONTTNURFD )

CHIP
But it’s only one all
TOM
I should go Got some ‘grooming’

to do
Minnow rolls her eyes at the joke

TOM (CONTD)
Sorry Minnow You understand

Tom swats her butt playfully with his racket and makes a
hasty exit

CHIP
(calling after Tom) Rest assured
your toast will never surpass

mine

TOM
I’m counting on you to mortify the
guests

CHIP

Your backhand sucks
TOM

You know what they say You’re

only as good as your opponent
Tom heads onto the nearby golf green walking very
quickly
EXT GOLF GREEN
Tom hurries across the golf course the quickest route to
the road
EXT WATER STREET
Tom rushes along a country road as manicured greens give
way to dense woods
INT GRAVEYARD
Then he’s running--propelled by his anxiety He ducks
into an ancient graveyard follows the central path The

headstones are chalky and crowded Many bear the Hayes
name

(CONTTNURFD )

He breaks from the path heading into brush As the
brush gets thicker he moves more frantically deeper
into the foliage But he stops suddenly--he’s been
scraped and his arm is bleeding Through the leaves he
can just make out the glittering bay and the last ferry
pulling out of the harbor

EXT HAYES LAWN

CU A BOTTLE OF BOURBON as it is placed in the hutch of an
OAK TREE Augusta strides away from the tree after
placing the bottle at its center

EXT PORCH

The wedding party is assembled on the porch enjoying the

weather catching up The girls lounge on chairs while
the boys toss a ball on the lawn

WEESIEE
(watching Augusta) What is she
doing

LILA

Ancient family tradition To
ensure a sunny wedding day Shes
got booze stashed in every tree on
this lawn

TRIPLER
Ill take it off her hands

Augusta reaches the porch

WEESIE TRIPLER LAURA
Mrs Hayes

AUGUSTA
Girls What a sight This porch
has not looked so grand in years

TRIPLER
Wish I could say the same of
myself

AUGUSTA

Nonsense You look exactly the
same Now quickly I need
updates on everyone How’s the
movie business Trip

(CONTTNURFD )

TRIPLER
Oh you know Fast-paced
impossibly glamorous

AUGUSTA
And the hospital Dr Baker

WEESIE
I start my rotations in the fall

AUGUSTA
My goodness Already Wonderful
Laura I read your story in the
The New Yorker last month

LAURA
Oh thanks

An awkward pause No compliment follows Augusta turns
to the boys

AUGUSTA
Jake how’s the Great American
novel coming

JAKE
Very slowly One page at a time

AUGUSTA
I understand you’re switching
professions Very wise An MBA
never goes out of style

JAKE
Actually I changed my mind
Think I’m more cut out for the
Law

AUGUSTA
Even better Please expect my
call And Pete my goodness
congratulations Again

JAKE
Yeah Pete You got any openings
over there

PETE

I don’t think youd like working
for me buddy My employees are
expected to show up for work

JAKE
Ouch

(CONTTNURFD )

Augusta smiles and takes command again

AUGUSTA
I’m putting you all at the
Getty’s right across the field
They’re cousins of William’s and
they’ve generously offered the
house to the wedding party

She waves majestically at a house just down the coast
smaller more modest version of the Hayes’

AUGUSTA (CONTD)
It’s a strange house but a sweet
house nonetheless But it’s
clean it’s close and the view is
nice Oh and it’s haunted just
like ours

LILA
Mom

AUGUSTA
(to Lila) What It’s only fair to
warn them

LILA
(to her friends) Just nod and
smile

AUGUSTA

(to the group) Once William was
run out of the house He was up in
the attic one cold December night
when all of a sudden--

LILA
Mother youve made your point

AUGUSTA
He heard loud and furious
footsteps He took this as his
cue that he had overstayed his
welcome And there was that time
he saw his grandmother sitting on
the roof

Shrieks and giggles from the crowd

PETE
Sounds like the makings of an
interesting night

LAURA
We’ll be sure to watch our backs

(CONTTNURFD )

a

AUGUSTA
Oh they don’t bother family
members On the contrary they
protect us

TRIPLER
(joking) Maybe Pete and I will
stay in that bed-and-breakfast in
town

LAURA
Can I come too

Augusta stops laughing eyes Laura

AUGUSTA
You will all be fine because
youre all family

PETE
Phew

TRIPLER
(whispering to Laura) I think she
meant everyone except you

LILA
Alright you guys I’11 show you
your rooms That is if youll
still stay

A gracious smile from Lila Warm laughter from the
group They start toward the house Laura lingers then
follows

INT GETTY’S HOUSE--LAURA’S ROOM

Laura drops her bags in her guest room surveys the
breezy quarters The decor is quintessential Maine--
faded furniture and dusty sunlight Then she sees it--a
wrapped present on the bed “I’m so proud of you Love

sila” aura opens it The masthead of the New Yorker--
her article framed and matted Laura smiles totally
moved Lila does everything beautifully

She wanders to the window to assess the view the Hayes’

grand estate and the surrounding water then Lila--in the

distance

Laughter in the hall jars Laura and reminds her of her
task her toast

LAURA
Lila Hayes is not my friend

(CONTTNURFD )

FH HF

Long pause

LAURA (CONTD)
She is my sister

No this won’t do

LAURA (CONTD)
Lila and I have shared many things
over the years rooms clothes
colds study notes boyfriends

This won’t do either Perhaps sincerity

LAURA (CONTD)
Lila Hayes is quite possibly the
most graceful girl in the world
Beauty intelligence a killer
backhand--she is graced with all
of these things

She pauses comforted She has found the right tack

LAURA (CONTD)
But in addition to her good
fortune in said areas Lila is
perhaps most graced in love

She trails off again

LAURA (CONTD)
She’s marrying the best guy in the
world And he is marrying her

INT BATHROOM-GETTY’S HOUSE

Tripler and Weesie stand in the bathroom grooming their
heads in towel turbans Tripler sprays perfume and steps
into the mist

WEESIE
What was that

TRIPLER
It’s just perfume

WEESIE
Could you try not to spray it in
my nose

Weesie looks up to find Laura has joined them

(CONTTNURFD )

WEESIE (CONTD)
There you are

LAURA
I’m screwed for my toast I
havent written a word

WEESIE
You always say that and then you
give the best one

TRIPLER
You have an unfair advantage Miss
Published Writer

Laura smiles

TRIPLER (CONTD)
But tonight you’ve got
competition

She points to a stack of index cards on the sink

WEESIE
Your signature rhyming ode

TRIPLER
Guaranteed to bring down the
house

Weesie pries her eye open and applies eyeliner Tripler
applies lipstick Laura splashes cold water on her face

WEESIE
(to Laura) You okay

LAURA
(snapping) Why does everyone keep
asking me that

TRIPLER
Hmm I wonder

LAURA
Sorry I woke up really early
Such a long drive

TRIPLER
Cut the bullshit Lo It’s us
When’s the last time you saw him

LAURA
Saw who

Laura plays dumb continues washing her face

(CONTTNURFD )

TRIPLER
When’s the last time you saw Tom

LAURA
Oh God I don’t know

TRIPLER
You don’t know You dated the man
for four years

WEESIE
Five

Laura shoots Weesie a look

WEESIE (CONTD)
But you guys have stayed close

LAURA
Yeah we are I meanwe were

TRIPLER
When

WEESIE
Tripler leave it alone

TRIPLER
No I want to know

LAURA
Around when they got engaged

TRIPLER
A year ago

LAURA
I honestly don’t remember

Tripler raises an eyebrow

TRIPLER
Before he proposed

LAURA
Around then I guess

TRIPLER
You guess

LAURA
Fine Trip The day before

(CONTTNURFD )

WEESIE
That’s sweet He called to tell
you first

LAURA
No

TRIPLER
But you spoke to him

LAURA
Yes
TRIPLER
On the phone or in person
WEESIE
Back off Trip
LAURA
In person
TRIPLER

So you knew before Lila

LAURA
Actually he didn’t mention it

TRIPLER
He didn’t mention it

LAURA
Nope

WEESIEE
So when did you hear

LAURA
When Lila calledto ask me to be
in the wedding

ANNIE
And then

LAURA
And then nothing

TRIPLER
Nothing

LAURA
We haven’t spoken since

Long pause as Tripler and Weesie digest this information
Awkward silence scored by running water

(CONTTNURFD )

WEESIE
Oh sweetie

LAURA
Please you guys It’s ancient
history I couldn’t be happier
for them

For the first time Tripler has proven herself right

Laura is a terrible liar

EXT FIELD

Showered and dressed the friends traipse across the lawn
to the Hayes’ house Everyone breathes a bit more freely

on this perfect August afternoon

EXT HAYES ESTATE--LAWN

A crowd is assembled around Augusta Lila stands apart

greeting guests Laura approaches gingerly
moment she’s been dreading Tom

Then the

The sight of him is startling then comforting like the
sight of a childhood home And the confusion she feels--
elation followed by sadness--nearly brings her to her

knees

Tom notices Laura and stops in his tracks

He seems

nervous ill-at-ease They stand for a moment staring
at each other until Tripler grabs Laura’s elbow

TRIPLER
I need you to tell me if this is
funny I’m gonna say Lila this
is your last chance to have Pete

She pauses

TRIPLER (CONTD)
No Not funny

Laura stares at Tripler mute
Just in time Augusta takes command
AUGUSTA
Ladies Gentlemen I hate to
interrupt but cocktails beckon us

tonight Lila Tom

They grasp her arms

(CONTTNURFD )

AUGUSTA (CONTD)
Let’s do this quickly shall we
So we can toast this fabulous
pair

Tom takes his cue and performs a scheduled kiss but a
moment too late like an actor who has forgotten a line

Laura watches intently

What’s wrong with this picture

Without warning Chip sneaks up from behind and grabs her
by the waist

Augusta eyes Laura a reprimand for her volume

CHIP
I knew it I still make you weak
in the knees

LAURA
Chip (softening her tone) You
nearly took me down

AUGUSTA
We’1ll do one walk-through of the
procession Members of the wedding
party I need you to break into
pairs Husbands with wives
fiances with fiances sisters with
brothers Oh and Laura you’1l
walk with Chip

The group break into pairs theatrically clutching

their pairs

Laura stalls bristling at the command

Finally she walks followed by Chip who pokes her
waist like a schoolboy

CHIP
Oh boy tonight’s the night

LAURA
The night you finally drink
yourself into a stupor

CHIP
The night You finally fall for me

LAURA
It’s such a shame about the age
difference

CHIP
No no It makes it easier for me
to have my way with you

(CONTTNURFD )

AUGUSTA
Family members last Flower girls
first Kathy and Tim youll walk
together Minnow you’1ll walk with
the bridesmaids after Tripler
but before Laura I’11 walk with
Chip Lila will walk with her
father And Tom will stand with
Reverend Bartlett

Everyone stands still too intimidated to move
Finally they begin with halting steps

JAKE
(to Pete) You would think it’s
your first time walking

PETE
I wouldn’t talk Frankenstein

One by one each pair completes the journey

LILA
Mom I think we’ve asked enough of
our guests

JAKE
Well exact our punishment
tonight At the rehearsal dinner

Laughter hoots and whistles As the group grows
restless we settle on Tom He looks like he’s about
to puke--or sprint

JAKE (CONTD)
If we drink enough

PETE
If you drink your usual amount
you won’t be standing when it’s
your turn to toast

Finally Tom joins in--he’s waking from a trance
TOM
If I drink enough both of you may
live to see me get married
tomorrow

Laughter and raucous applause from the crowd Laura

puts on a brave face Tom and Lila join hands and kiss

stiffly At the moment they seem more nervous than in

love

EXT YACHT CLUB--REHEARSAL DINNER

The scene is high WASP--a ramshackle house on a
picturesque bay women in pastel sparse appetizers A
blue and white awning rustles as clouds gather overhead
The wedding party have formed a human blockade at the
bar

Laura stands at the end of the huddle drink in hand

She wears a lovely if slightly funereal BLACK SHEATH
WITH A BLACK SASH A server passes with a TRAY Laura
takes a STUFFED MUSHROOM pops it into her mouth She
wanders into an empty spot But it’s the wrong move--she
walks right into Augusta

AUGUSTA
My heavens Everyone’s in black

Laura follows Augusta’s gaze into the crowd but finds a
sea of colors instead

AUGUSTA (CONTD)
Well you certainly are a city
girl

Laura smiles chews mortified

AUGUSTA (CONTD)
Now what is that perfume

LAURA
Isn’t it the marsh

AUGUSTA
No no Yours

Augusta stares past Laura searching the crowd for
another guest

Laura gulps swallows her food

AUGUSTA (CONTD)
Anne Wilcox There you are

Another smile signals the end of this painful exchange
Augusta moves toward the next guest Laura stands
shaken

INT YACHT CLUB TENT

Guests file into a crowded tent toward seated tables
Peach-colored ribbons hang from a tent pole clashing
wildly with neon green table cloths

(CONTTNURFD )

It is immediately clear that the McDevons are the hosts
of this event Augusta watches with increasing anxiety
She finally locates Lila and grabs her arm as she passes

(whispering) S

AUGUSTA
he might as well

have done a picnic on the grass
Served ribs on paper plates

Mom you’re a

Honestly it 1

parlor I told her Id do it for

her

LILA
guest tonight

AUGUSTA
ooks like a disco

LILA

Everyone’s having a wonderful
time You should try to do the

same

Augusta sighs Then regaining composure she steps back
and grasps Lila by the shoulders

AUGUSTA

You look stunning sweetheart

LILA

Thank you Mom

AUGUSTA

Now if we can only find your

groom

Together they scan the crowded tent but peach ribbons

obscure their view Augusta spots Tom first

Tom

stands at the edge of the lawn staring at the water

AUGUSTA (CONT’D)

Isn’t that funny

LILA

Isn’t what funny

The way he’s s

AUGUSTA
tanding over there

LILA

What’s funny about it

AUGUSTA

Oh maybe funny is the wrong word

Strange It’s

strange Isnt it

(CONTTNURFD )

LILA
What about it is strange

AUGUSTA
I don’t know just the way he’s
gazing out at the sea like a
lovesick sailor

Lila rolls her eyes She will not engage

LILA

Hes a groom Grooms get nervous
AUGUSTA

Of course
LILA

Mother please don’t do-

But she stops talking suddenly as she watches Tom throw a

coin into the harbor He DOES look like a lovesick

sailor

LILA (CONT’D
What is he doing

AUGUSTA
Darned if I know He looks
positively morose

LILA

No he doesn’t

But she agrees in spite of herself Tom looks terribly

sad And this makes Lila terribly angry

AUGUSTA
Youknow what I think
LILA
Yes I know what you think
AUGUSTA
Then perhaps you’ll permit me to
say it
LILA

Iknow you will do so regardless

AUGUSTA
He has to love YOU more

LILA
More than what

(CONTTNURFD )

Augusta seals her mouth

LILA (CONTD)

More than whom

Augusta says nothing gives her best performance of

ignorance

AUGUSTA
More than you love him darling
It’s the only way marriage works

Lila pauses considers her mother’s claim then dispenses

with the thought

LILA
Leave him alone

But Augusta has gotten to her Lila breaks away
ducks out of the tent and approaches Tom

EXT YACHT CLUB LAWN--DUSK

Lila arrives behind Tom and slips her hands in his
pockets His body tenses then relaxes

LILA
Honey

TOM
So quiet

LILA

Yes much better It’s awfully
loud over there

Tom doesn’t turn just continues staring at the water

TOM
We’re going to have a good life

LILA
Yes we are

Lila stands for another moment then annoyed removes her
hands and steps to his side Finally Tom takes notice
He pivots her shoulders to face him remembers her
beauty kisses her

TOM
How’s your mother doing

(CONTTNURFD )

LILA
She’ll be fine after a few
cocktails

She flutters her lashes in a bid for another kiss
Tom smiles and obliges and relaxes just a little

INT YACHT CLUB TENT-LATER

The wedding party is assembled at their own table
already happily drunk At the sound of the first
clinking glass they rise to attention They are the
self-appointed judges of tonight’s festivities

The first toast of the evening is given by Lila’s
paternal grandmother She stands and clinks her glass

GRANDMOTHER HAYES
Tom McDevon is quite a catch a
Summa graduate a Championship
swimmer a phD candidate in
English rather easy on the eyes
Lila is somewhat clever herself a
brilliant lawyer a devoted
daughter and the greatest beauty
in all of New England So let’s
raise our glasses to two perfect
catches Perfect catch perfect
match

The wedding party smile warmly then lower their voices to
exchange scathing commentary

TRIPLER
I would like to congratulate the
McDevons on getting one to the
other side I would like to offer
my condolences to the Hayes
There goes the bloodline

She guffaws

PETE
Trip Stop it

Next up is Tom’s very drunk grandfather Timothy
McDevon He rises from his chair clinking his
glass so violently that nearby guests brace for broken
glass

MR MCDEVON
Hear hear

The guests watch with concern Timothy is off-balance

(CONTTNURFD )

MR MCDEVON (CONTD)
When Tommy told me he was marrying
Leila

An audible gasp from the crowd At the Hayes’ table
Augusta rises to stand but William steadies her in her
seat

MR MCDEVON (CONTD)
I said to him

RELATIVES
(first whispering then louder)
Lila It’s Lila

Mr McDevon pauses confused by the commotion

MR MCDEVON
I said you lucky son of a bitch

Hearty laughter from the crowd

MR MCDEVON (CONTD)
I mean Tom I said how in the
Hell did you bed a woman like
that

More laughter

We get a better glimpse of the Hayes table Mr Hayes is
drunk Augusta is panicked Minnow is grinning Chip is
wasted Mr Hayes rises to speak as soon as Timothy
falls to his seat

MR HAYES
What a joyous occasion

He scans the crowd in a regal fatherly way

MR HAYES (CONTD)
Lila and I have always been tight
Ever since she was a little girl
I’1l never forget the time she
learned to ride a bike a bright
pink Huffy with handlebars and a
basket

DISSOLVE TO

INT TENT-LATER

Toasts continue in a dream-like blur as the guests grow
more and more drunk Laura watches with increasing
anxiety It’s high time she speak up

(CONTTNURFD )

Snippets of toasts continue in jump cuts

MINNOW
Id like to end with a heartfelt
plea to my parents that you
finally convert Lila’s bedroom
into the clubhouse I’ve been
promised

CUT TO

JAKE
As everyone knows Tom was
unmatched in the swimming pool

CUT TO

PETE
As everyone knows Tom was
unmatched on the soccer field

CUT TO

WEESIE
And how can we ever forget that
time on the ferry to Martha’s
Vineyardan incident involving a
hot dog and a boy who shall
forever remain nameless so help
me God

She giggles and hastily sits down
CUT TO

TRIPLER
(Rhyming couplets Something
pretentious and awful)

The wedding party is slumped in their chairs eyes glazed
over

Finally Laura gathers her nerve and stands

LAURA
Lila

She surveys the crowd in search of a comforting smile
But she finds only wide expectant eyes Typically words
rush in at this moment Now her mind is cruelly blank

LAURA (CONTD)
Lila and I were assigned to each
other the fall of freshman year
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA (CONTD)
It was touch and go for a few days
there She was extraverted and I
was shy She was brunette I was
blond--okay not really but
still She was from Boston I
was from New York She was tidy
I was messy Cue Jack Lemmon and
Walter Matthau But then we
discovered our shared love of the
Kinks and suddenly everything
changed We quickly pooled our CD
collections and discovered our
differences made us killer study
partners and even better friends
By sophomore year we were
inseparabletotally in love so
much so that we earned a nickname
La-la they called us It stuck

She looks to her friends Weesie smiles and nods Then
Tom catches her eye He is staring at her with the
strangest combination of concern and admiration Lila
catches this and clears her throat feigning
obliviousness But Tom disengages

LAURA (CONT’D)
Our group of friends got a
nickname too They called us ‘the
Romantics’ It was a nod to our
incestuous dating history the
fact that we’d all dated each
other by sophomore spring

Pete yells from the crowd

PETE
Sophomore fall

LAURA
Thank you Pete But when you
think about it the name was truly
apt We were in love with each
other All of us That’s what
best friends do They fall in
love Then they fall out of love
And they do this again and again
for the rest of their lives

Laura trails off for a moment Where was she going with
this She finds herself staring at Tom He’s staring at

her Lila witnesses the exchange She’s not happy
Laura rushes to conclude

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA (CONTD)

That Tom and Lila fell in love is
of course no surprise They are
both exceptional people and they
are going to have an exceptional
lifeI wish them all the joy in
the world (raising her glass) To
your glittering future

Laura collapses into her seat folds and unfolds the

napkin in her lap She turns to Tripler for moral
support

LAURA (CONTD)
Did I seem like I was overcome
with emotion or on the verge of a
nervous breakdown

TRIPLER
Maybe a little bit of both

A clinking glass spares Laura further discussion
Chip rises to speak He nearly knocks down his own
chair He is totally and completely wasted

CHIP
Let’s face it My sister is
perfect Everyone here knows that

The crowd hushes to attention

CHIP (CONTD)
If you’re a chick you’ve spent
your life fighting the urge to
kill her in her sleep If you’re a
guy you’ve spent your life trying
to sleep with her

A rogue hoot and cheer

CHIP (CONTD)
(turning sharply to Jake) Admit
it Jake

Weesie turns to her husband in shock Jake
recoils defiant

CHIP (CONTD)
(to weesie) Don’t worry Weesie
He never got anywhere

Enraged Weesie inches her chair away from her
husband

(CONTTNURFD )

H

CHIP (CONTD)
Tom McDevon ain’t too shabby
Lila’s friends can attest to that
Let’s just say those weren’t tears
of joy when Laura heard about the
engagement

Laura watches strangely composed braced for Chip’s
next joke Augusta is nearly standing ready for an
emergency removal Lila glares at her brother Tom

holds her hand and strokes it

CHIP (CONTD)
Mom Dad I know it’s been hard to
embrace the new in-laws But
don’t worry We only have to see
them on Thanksgiving and

Christmas (poltergiest voice)
Every year for the rest of our
lives

A rebellious chirp of laughter from an increasingly
somber audience

CHIP (CONTD)
Wait a second Do Irish people
celebrate Christmas Or Chanukah

The joke is met with silence The guests look back
uncomfortably

CHIP (CONTD)
In closing let me just say one
last thing Tomorrow is going to
be fantastic

He pauses riding the crescendo

CHIP (CONTD)
If it’s not my mother’s going to
bust a nad

He laughs No one else does

CHIP (CONTD)
That is if they even make it to
the altar

He whips his head around to face the wedding
party singling out Laura then falls into
his chair

A hacking cough Clearing of throats It’s not until the
fourth maybe fifth bite of chocolate cake that the
guests resume conversation

INT YACHT CLUB TENT-LATER
Lila weaves through the disbanding crowd in search of an
exit She is still fuming over Chip’s toast
EXT YACHT CLUB LAWN
Lila heads into the parking lot But Tripler intercepts
TRIPLER
You didn’t think you could escape
that easy

Lila turns but barely stops

LILA
Can you believe him

TRIPLER
Who
LILA
Chip
TRIPLER
I don’t even remember what he
said

Lila shakes her head

TRIPLER (CONTD)
Stay Have one drink

LILA
I can’t I need hours maybe days
of silence

TRIPLER
Boring

LILA
I’1l see you at midnight

Tripler stares back blank

LILA (CONTD)
Remember You guys said you’d
come tuck me in Remind the
others Don’t forget

Tripler salutes Lila disappears

INT YACHT CLUB TENT

The wedding party straggle out of the club ina
boisterous joyful mood Jake and Pete smuggle alcohol
from the bartenders Jake distracts while Pete grabs
bottles and shoves them into his pockets He emerges
looking like an inflated balloon

INT HAYES HOUSE

Lila enters the darkened house and hurries toward her
bedroom This is our first good look at the interior of
the house and it surpasses even the grandest
expectations We track Lila as she hurries past yards of
perfect chintz ample buoyant pillows She starts up the
stairs and ascends quickly

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

She lands in her bedroom a perfect museum of her
childhood trophies horse show ribbons rosebud
wallpaper Without stopping she walks to a book-case
locates a timeworn thesaurus then opens it to reveal a
hollow box holding a row of airplane-sized BOTTLES and
CIGARETTES Grabbing both she proceeds to the window
jacks it open and squeezes through just in time it
seems to avoid jumping out

EXT HAYES ESTATE--LAWN

A large group stumbles down the lawn heading toward the
water They are laughing singing having the time of
their lives--never freer never happier The whole
wedding party--Jake Weesie Tripler Pete Laura and
Chip--are in tow with Tom bringing up the rear Clouds
have risen overheard but from everyone’s mood it might
as well have gotten warmer

WEESIEE
(singing--badly) Girl I want to
be with you in the morning

PETE
All day And all of the night

WEESIE AND PETE
Girl I want to be with you all of
the time

TRIPLER AND CHIP
All day and all of the night

(CONTTNURFD )

Loud off-tune hilarious signing They are at that
stage in drunkenness when you think everything needs to
be shouted

TRIPLER
Movement to go skinny-dipping

WEESIE
Oh God You always do this

Chip sprints to catch up

CHIP
I’m game and so is Tom I
guarantee he wants one more
glimpse of ass before his wedding
day

PETE
I think he got his fill at his
bachelor party

TOM
Please The last time I saw you
that night you were surrounded by
naked women

TRIPLER
Pete You filthy pig (to Tom)
Tell me right this second Do I
need to divorce my husband

TOM
Sadly no The stripper wouldnt
have him

PETE

Trip come on He’s lying

He takes a running start at Tom But Tom hears the
footsteps and picks up his speed The two circle round
the group breathless and laughing Pete runs
squealing into Tripler’s arms Tom out of breath falls
behind and walks finding himself close enough to Laura
that not talking is just too weird They walk in silence
for an awkward moment

TOM
I liked your speech

LAURA
Thanks

Awkward silence

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA (CONTD)
Congratulations

TOM
Thanks

More silence

TOM (CONTD)
I’m sorry

LAURA
It’s fine It was necessary

TOM
It was for the best

LAURA
Totally

TOM
Who am I kidding It was torture

Laura stops thrown by his honesty But she doesn’t
trust it

LAURA
It was easier than I expected

TOM
It was harder than I thought it
would be

Was that a compliment or an insult

More silence Grass crushing under their
feet

TOM (CONTD)
Have you missed me

LAURA
Not for a second

TOM
I think about you all the time
Not a day goes by An hour A
minute

Another pause

TOM (CONTD)
I don’t know if I can do it

(CONTTNURFD )

How dare he keep messing with her Luckily she
converges with her friends at just this moment and folds
into the group They are teetering down a wooden pier
that leads to the water At the bottom of the pier is a

wooden FLOAT that’s attached with rope

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

Lila sits on her window ledge smoking A knock at the

door interrupts She stubs out the cigarette madly fans

the air She doesn’t like to be surprised

LILA

Mom
Minnow enters sheepishly

MINNOW
It’s me

LILA
Oh hi

MINNOW
Hi

LILA

Something wrong

MINNOW
Just nervous I guess

LILA
I’m the one who’s getting married
silly

MINNOW

Lila smiles chides herself for snapping softens her

tone

LILA
What are you nervous about

MINNOW
You know Nothing Everything

Lila smiles

MINNOW (CONT ’D)

I’m worried Mom’s gonna go psycho

after the wedding
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

MINNOW (CONTD)
You know how she gets when she
finishes a project all up in your
grill ‘n shit

LILA
‘Up in your grill ‘n shit’

MINNOW
Youknow what I mean TI just
don’t want to deal with all that
attention

LILA
Isee

Lila nods knowingly But it’s clear to her that Minnow

is worried about just the opposite This is Minnow’s way

of saying she’s afraid of losing her big sis

LILA (CONTD)
Ithink youll be spared TI bet

shell be testy for a week or so
then shell hatch some elaborate
plan for Christmas Then before
youknow it Chip will do
something idiotic and she’1ll be
totally consumed by him

Minnow smiles She appreciates the attention

MINNOW
What about you Are you nervous

LILA
Nope
MINNOW
Idon’t know why I asked Nothing
phases you
LILA
That’s not true
MINNOW
Well if it does you never show

Lila smiles thinks for a moment then suddenly a

confession

LILA

I’m terrified

(CONTTNURFD )

HF HH

MINNOW
You are

LILA
Yup To the bone

MINNOW
What about

LILA

I just have this terrible feeling
I’m not sure Tom willI’m not
sure Tom canI’m not sure Tom
is

Minnow is rapt Her sister has never spoken this
candidly with her before

MINNOW
Youre not sure he’s what

LILA
I’m just not sure

Minnow pauses She feels out of her league This is a
very grown-up conversation But she takes a deep breath
and rises to the occasion

MINNOW
Does he make you feel loved

LILA
Yes yes he does

MINNOW
Does he make you feel beautiful

LILA
Yes

MINNOW
Does he make you feel safe

Lila pauses

LILA
Most of the time

MINNOW
Does he make you feel special

LILA
Special

(CONTTNURFD )

FH

MINNOW

Youknowlike you’re the most

interesting person in the world

the one he wants to talk to more

than anyone in the room

Lila takes her time to answer this one

LILA

Yes he does He does You know

what This is silly Ignore me

But Minnow has taken Lila seriously

MINNOW

Does he wake up in the morning

thinking about you About what

would make you happy

This one stumps Lila

MINNOW (CONT ’D)

Because that’s what you need to

Marry someone and that’s what you

deserve

Lila nods She is grateful--and impressed by Minnow’s

maturity

MINNOW (CONT ’D)

Do you want my opinion

LILA

Yes I do

MINNOW
I don’t think he does

LILA

(snapping) You don’t think he does

what

MINNOW

I don’t think he wakes up thinking

about you I think he wakes up

thinking about himself-and goes

to sleep thinking about himself

too And if you want to know the

truth I think he spends a little

too much time thinking about

someone else Did you see how he

was staring at Laura during

dinner I mean come on

embarrassing

(CONTTNURFD )

FH

ee FH HF

Lila halts dumbfounded

LILA
What the hell are you talking
about

MINNOW
Iwas watching him during the
rehearsal dinner I’m sorry It

was messed up

LILA

Don’t be an idiot

MINNOW

You said you wanted my opinion

LILA
Itake it back

MINNOW

Look don’t shoot the messenger

If your own sister can’t be
straight with you--

LILA
Straight with me You’re just
trying to kick up a fuss You
don’t know what you’re talking
about Now get out And take
your childish theories with you

Ive had my fill of your advice

Minnow stalls wounded

MINNOW
God you asked me

LILA
And now I’m asking you to leave

ee HF

Minnow doesn’t move Lila struggles to contain herself

LILA (CONT’D)

Now

Furious Minnow storms from the room Lila marches to
the window and more anxious than before lights another
cigarette

EXT WOODEN PIER

The group file down the pier single file

(CONTTNURFD )

TRIPLER
Let’s all get on and unmoor it

PETE
That thing was built in 1954
We’1l sink it in ten seconds

CHIP
The float is moored to the dock
And it has been since I was three
But for the real excitement let’s
get naked and go crabbing

GROUP
EIW Chip Gross

JAKE
Hey Chip who invited you

WEESIE
Shut up Jake He lives here

CHIP
Listen to your wife or I might
have to enlist the famous Hayes
ghost against you

Another moan of exasperation But soon enough the plan
becomes a motion One by one they file down the PIER
and assemble on the FLOAT

EXT FLOAT

They arrange themselves around the perimeter of the
FLOAT laughing singing joking Everyone but Tom and
Laura is carefree They are universally drunk and happy

CHIP
Tom you didn’t give a toast
tonight

JAKE
Yeah what’s wrong You scared of
Augusta

TOM

No I was having too much fun
watching you guys make fools of
yourselves

Boo’s hisses

(CONTTNURFD )

Tom takes

Long pause

Laughter

Tom bows

PETE
Well how about giving one now

TRIPLER
Yeah

JAKE PETE WEESIE
Speech Speech Speech

TOM
You want a speech Fine I’1l
give a speech

JAKE
This should be interesting

PETE
I want to hear this

a long dramatic pause

TOM
As I gaze at this assembly of
friends and family on this
momentous occasion only one thing
comes to mind

TOM (CONTD)
I love you middle-aged fuck-ups

cheers

PETE
Here here

WEESIE
We love you too you thirty-year-
old

TOM
Thanks a lot for coming you guys

PETE
We wouldn’t miss it for the world

JAKE
(teasing) Well maybe for a few
things

TRIPLER
Finish the speech

(CONTTNURFD )

TOM
You’re the best friends a guy
could ever have That’s all I got
to say

A pause

TOM (CONTD)
Oh and I’m still fifty-fifty on
this whole wedding thing At this
very moment I couldn’t tell you
if I’m going to show up tomorrow

Tom looks very serious Then he breaks and smiles
Silence as the group struggles to discern his tone

Laura watches unmoved This is typical Tom a ploy
for laughs and attention Nothing more Or is it

JAKE
Can you imagine Augusta’s
reaction

PETE

How would she do it

WEESTIEE
She’d run him down with the Volvo

JAKE
Knife to the back

TRIPLER
She’d bludgeon him with the bottle
of Bourbon

The debate rages on until it suffers competition from a
chorus of very bad singing

GROUP
Here we are now Entertain us I
feel stupid And contagious
Sound and images blur to reflect the group’s extremely
drunken state

We focus on Laura and Tom Though they’re sitting
on opposite sides of the float but they’re totally
aware of one another

TRIPLER
Okay okay Let’s vote on the
best toast of the night I’m
gonna venture to say mine

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
Sorry Trip Chip won hands
down Grandpa McDevon came in
second

WEESIE
Oh my God that was amazing

Above the sky has grown menacing The wind has
picked up and churned the water Then someone looks

up

TRIPLER
Wait a second Weren’t those
lights closer before

WEESIE
Very funny

TRIPLER
No I’m serious

The others follow her gaze toward the house The
lights have drifted significantly Or rather the
FLOAT has drifted Consensus is followed by dread
EXT OPEN WATER
The FLOAT drifts in the open bay about half a mile from
the house
TOM
Chip you little shit

CHIP
Dude it wasn’t me

PETE
Dude calm down We’re not that
far out

WEESIE

I can’t swim right now

TRIPLER
Here Ill swim with you

WEESIE
Oh great Then we’ll both drown

TOM
Alright everyone We’re gonna
use the buddy system

(CONTTNURFD )

He points out pairs in the group And as quickly as
they panicked they settle on a plan ducking off
the float and beginning the swim back to shore

EXT WATER

The group swim steadily anxiously We follow them as
they go Laura swims back on her own Tom is nearby
moving in slow confident strokes He seems to be
watching out for her

EXT SHORE

The swimmers arrive tired and breathless They assemble
dutifully in pairs Jake begins a head-count

JAKE
One two three four five six
seven

PETE

(in a scary voice) It’s the curse
of the Ghost of Northern Gardens

Laughter

But Jake is struggling He starts again

JAKE
One two three four five six
seven

PETE

(ghost sounds) Ooooh oooooh

More laughter

JAKE
Hey wait Shut up

PETE
You shut up

JAKE

No asshole We’re short by one

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

Lila finishes a cigarette stubs it out and climbs back
in her window A row of butts reveals she has smoked
several She glances at her watch and climbs into bed

EXT SHORE

Everyone mills about on the shore The mood has shifted
from revelry to controlled panic

WEESTIEE
Where could he be

JAKE
I bet he’s passed out on the lawn
He was loaded back there on the
float

WEESIE
I can’t believe we let him swim

JAKE
Chill out you guys This is Tom
McDevon Inter-Collegiate
champion

WEESIE
But why would he bolt without
saying goodbye

CHIP
The current was rather perilous
tonight

Laura eyes Chip Enough

PETE
It’s weird that we didn’t see him
come out He’s not that much
faster than me

JAKE
(teasing) You used to beat him in
Butterfly by half a second
What’s happened to you Champ

WEESIE
Jake stop it

JAKE
Come on This is a prank you
guys He loves shit like this I
bet he’s hiding in the attic right
now waiting to pounce (waving at
the attic) We see you up there
Tom

TRIPLER
Maybe he wanted some time alone to
work out his wedding-day jitters

(CONTTNURFD )

WEESIE
But that thing he said on the
float What if that was some sort
of threat

PETE
Guys get a clue Did you see
Lila tonight If he has half a
brain in his head he made a break
for her room

They pause gaining confidence in this theory but doubt
creeps in again Laura hangs back listening to her
friends drawing her own conclusions

WEESIE
I think we should call the cops
let them do a proper search

CHIP
(egging them on) But what if it’s
something worse than drowning

WEESIE
What do you mean

CHIP
Drowning on purpose

WEESIE
Oh my God

PETE

Alright Enough you guys lLet’s
just look for the guy We’1l stay
in these pairs and canvass the

place Come on Let’s get going

Each girl takes her place by her husband awaiting
further instructions Laura scans the group and suddenly
realizes she’s been stuck with Chip

LAURA
Oh no We need some time apart

Chip does a pantomime of heartbreak receiving an
arrow to the heart and falling to the ground

Weesie eyes Laura concerned tries a solution

WEESIE
I know Why don’t we mix things
up Switch partners Like a
dinner party

(CONTTNURFD )

Tripler pauses to consider then pounces She steps away
from Pete toward Jake

TRIPLER
Dibs on Jake

Weesie freezes She doesn’t like this idea
anymore

PETE
Fine by me Weesie

Pete takes a step toward Weesie

Weesie smiles--it’s too late to make a fuss She looks
to Laura shrugs--I tried

Laura stares at her friends annoyed

CHIP
(to Laura) Oh come on I’m not
that bad

Laura stares at Chip then looks back to her
friends Giving up she heads down the
lawn

TRIPLER
Wait You can’t leave until we’re
clear on the plan

Laura keeps walking

Chip sprints down the lawn after her As he runs he
makes a battle-cry making wide figure eights as though
he’s trying to destroy the greatest amount of grass

The group watch the spectacle

WEESIE
Maybe we should take her with us

TRIPLER
Neh she’ll be fine They’re like
brother and sister They just
like to mess with each other

They watch for another moment then re-focus

TRIPLER (CONTD)
Jake and I will search the main
house

WEESIE
Pete and I will do the Getty’s

(CONTTNURFD )

TRIPLER
(yelling so Laura can hear) We’1ll
meet on the porch at ten of
midnight Remember we promised
Lila

The pairs disperse

INT AUGUSTA BEDROOM

In the most immaculately decorated bedroom in the house
Augusta lies awake The room mixes elements of classic wasp
with more exotic touches a fern print sofa a sisal rug
and batik pillows William lies asleep next to Augusta

She stares at him with hatred

AUGUSTA
William

No answer

AUGUSTA (CONTD)
William wake up I’m in a panic

WILLIAM
What’s wrong

AUGUSTA
I think it’s going to rain

WILLIAM
Augusta come on

He falls back asleep

AUGUSTA
William wake up this instant
WILLIAM
I’m up
He’s not
AUGUSTA
You’re not
WILLIAM

I’m up
He is for a moment and then he’s back asleep

Augusta stares at her husband indignant Then suddenly
she is out of bed pulling on a bathrobe

INT HALLWAY

Augusta rushes down the hall

INT STAIRS

Augusta darts down the stairs

EXT HAYES LAWN

She bursts out of the house marches across the porch down
the lawn and arrives at the OAK TREE She checks the
bottle finds it full just where she left it Relief All
is as it should be

EXT SHORE

Laura begins to breathe again as she approaches the
water She takes a few steps and stops at the edge She
jumps when she realizes Chip is behind her

CHIP
This must be really hard for you

Chip lies on the beach propped up as though he’s
watching a movie

CHIP (CONTD)
You drive halfway up to the North
Pole to watch the love of your life
marry the bane of your existence and
this is how they thank you

LAURA
Honestly Chip I’m not in the mood

CHIP
It’s ironic Asking you of all
people to convince the groom to
show up for this wedding

Laura is silent It takes all her strength
CHIP (CONTD)
I really wish I could be there for
the reunion (impersonating) Oh Tom
I thought you were lost Oh Laura
I was Until I found you

She laughs in spite of herself

(CONTTNURFD )

CHIP (CONTD)
Personally I don’t think he drowned
Not our intercollegiate champion

LAURA
I heard you had to wear some sort of
ankle bracelet now

CHIP
Ankle bracelet That’s funny No
They just made me do some community
service

He bursts into hysterics and falls onto his back

LAURA
I’m gonna walk toward the Getty’s
see if he overshot the house

CHIP
Oh I wouldn’t do that It gets
really rocky over there And then
it turns to forest

Laura stares at Chip for a moment

LAURA
It’s fine if you don’t want to
come

She pauses daunted by the darkness then begins to walk
She is just beginning to breathe easier when footsteps
approach from behind and Chip tackles her to the ground
Shock and adrenaline combine to disorient her for a
moment

LAURA (CONTD)
Chip get off me

CHIP
Oh come on You know you want it
too

He tries again pinning her on the ground sloppily
jamming his tongue down her throat

LAURA
Chip get off you psychopath

Laura pushes him off and Chip falls to his back laughing
hysterically Laura gets up brushes herself off and walks
in the opposite direction

LAURA (CONTD)
Asshole

EXT LAWN

Tripler and Jake traipse up the lawn heading towards
the house It looks different at night--gothic
creepy haunted The wind has picked up It’s gotten
colder Looks like its going to storm

TRIPLER
If you were Tom where would you be
right now

JAKE
Id be in Lila’s bed

TRIPLER
That’s her window up there you know
if you want to take a last shot

JAKE
Thanks anyway

INT HAYES HOUSE-LIVING ROOM

Jake and Tripler enter the dark living room The decor is
impeccable cream chintz sofas with a botanical print a
cashmere throw damask fabric on the walls Tripler throws
herself onto the sofa with no caution for her wet clothes
She scans the table for an adequate surface settles on a
coaster She produces a PLASTIC BAG filled with white powder
and empties it

JAKE
You’ve got to be kidding
TRIPLER
What
JAKE
Isn’t that a little passe’
TRIPLER
Not when you mix it with

Welbutrin
Jake closes his eyes dismissing When he opens them
Tripler is hunched over the table Within seconds he
has a change of heart and moves to sit beside her

TRIPLER (CONTD)
Hey

(CONTTNURFD )

Tripler swats at Jake as he leans in for a sniff But she’s
too late He inhales a large amount

Jake gets up circles the room He pauses at a table
covered with framed pictures and picks one up to inspect
It’s Lila age 12 in a tennis skirt Even then she looked
hot

TRIPLER (CONT’D)
You ever think there was something
odd about the way Tom and Lila
started dating

JAKE
No

TRIPLER
It was right after we came up here
senior spring Remember we came
up for some long weekend

Jake nods distracted The thought of landing in
Lila’s bed right now seems totally appealing

TRIPLER (CONTD)
Don’t you think it’s an odd
coincidence

JAKE
Don’t be retarded

TRIPLER
He asked her out three days after
we got back Three days

JAKE
So what

TRIPLER
Never mind that he was dating
Laura at the time The two of
them were roommates for Christ’s
sake

JAKE
You think Tom started dating Lila
because he coveted her parents’

fortune

TRIPLER
You make it sound like an episode
of Dynasty

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
But that’s what you’re saying
right

TRIPLER

I’m just noting the dates

JAKE
Tom’s no worse than anyone else in
this group Everyone’s got their
little act Laura’s depressed
pretending to be happy Weesie’s
a mess pretending to have her
shit together Pete’s a fuck-up
pretending to be a success
Youre a geek pretending to be
cool I don’t see the difference

TRIPLER
And what are you

JAKE
I’m just a miserable bastard
pretending to give a shit

TRIPLER
All I’m saying is I think Lila’s
lifestyle appealed to Tom just
like her perfect tits appeal to
you

JAKE
(snapping) I’m sure those appeal
to Tom as well

Tripler shrugs and looks away Guess she picked the wrong

partner

EXT HAYES LAWN

Laura walks slowly up the lawn weary but determined As she
walks she is mesmerized by a TREE whose branches sway in
the wind Suddenly the trunk seems to move as though it’s

splitting in

two Laura freezes Is she that drunk Then

suddenly she realizes

He looks up

LAURA
Tom

eyes wide

LAURA (CONTD)
Tom

(CONTTNURFD )

TOM
(whispering) Laura

She takes another step towards the tree

LAURA
Everyone thinks you’re dead
TOM
Right now that seems the better

option
Long pause But she won’t fall for it
LAURA
I should go Tell the others

youre okay

TOM
Don’t go

She starts walking

LAURA
They’re really worried

TOM
Please stay

For Laura the difference is crucial

TOM (CONT’D)
No one knows where I am

LAURA
Exactly
TOM
And no one knows where you are
LAURA
Your point
TOM

We could just hang out for a
little while and no one would know
the difference

INT LILA’S BATHROOM

Lila stands at the mirror covering her face with a blue
mask She stares at herself in the mirror as if submitting

herself to a harsh interrogation then making a decision
she turns off the light and enters her bedroom

(CONTTNURFD )

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

Lila her face still covered in blue sits down at her desk

pulls out a STACK OF OLD BLACK-AND-WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS-artful

ones that she snapped and developed The photos are

gorgeous dynamic shots of her friends and interesting places-
-Paris Tokyo Maine But she’s looking for one in
particular She flips through faster and faster She finds
it a PHOTO OF LAURA AND TOM And she inspects it as though
it holds a clue A LOUD PEEL OF LAUGHTER in the hall jars
her Annoyed she marches to the window peers out finds
nothing and closes the shutters

EXT HAYES LAWN

Weesie and Pete traipse across the lawn to the Getty’s

WEESIE
So we’ve been assigned to the
bedrooms

PETE
Yup

Weesie glances back at the house She is clearly nervous
but trying to appear calm

PETE (CONTD)
You trust him right

WEESIE
Who Jake Of course
PETE
Good cause I don’t trust Tripler

one bit

Weesie laughs and forgets her anxiety for the first time in
hours They approach the door and enter the house

INT GETTY’S HOUSE-HALLWAY

Pete and Weesie walk down a hall opening doors checking
closets

WEESIE
He’s not here

PETE
Nope Doesn’t seem to be

(CONTTNURFD )

He HF HH

WEESIE
Where do you think he is

PETE
That’s a very good question One I
need a drink to consider

INT LIVING ROOM

They land in the living room Pete collapses onto the
sofa

WEESIE
You’re not worried

PETE
Not at all Wedding day jitters is
a universal affliction

WEESIE
Did you do freak out the night
before your wedding

PETE
I spent the night before my wedding
trapped in a closet Of course
Tripler locked me in it

Weesie smiles She’s about to relax but her conscience
gets the better of her

WEESIE
I hope Laura’s okay
PETE
She’s fine
WEESIE
Chip was kind of a nightmare
PETE
No worse than usual
WEESIE
And you don’t think we should tell
Lila
PETE

Why worry her for no reason
Weesie nods She tries once again to relax

Pete pats his pant leg

(CONTTNURFD )

PETE (CONTD)
I could have sworn I had another
bottle in here

He gets up to search the room for a bar opening cupboards
rattling closets

Weesie sits waits

PETE (OS) (CONTD)
So when’s the big date again

WEESIE
October 5th

PETE
You excited

WEESIE
Yeah Very

PETE
You scared

WEESIE

Neh I figure I know what I’m in
for We’ve been together for
almost ten years

PETE
Wow are we that old

WEESIE
And besides if you and Trip are
any indication married life is
bliss

PETE
Aha You do have a sense of humor

Pete has discovered a BOTTLE of TEQUILA He displays it
triumphantly

PETE (CONTD)
To your glittering future

He takes a large swig passes it to Weesie

WEESIE
To my glittering future

Weesie gulps

EXT LAWN-OAK TREE

Tom and Laura sit by the tree comfortable side by side
There’s a new ease between them Both look calmer than they
have all night

LAURA
You looked a little freaked during
the rehearsal

TOM
Have you ever felt Augusta’s grip

Tom laughs stares off at something
TOM (CONT’D)
Wait a second She’s got one in

this tree

LAURA
What

TOM
Another bottle

He stands and removes a BOTTLE OF BOURBON from the hutch
opens it rebelliously

LAURA
I wouldn’t do that
TOM
Oh no
LAURA
Not unless you want to unleash the
heavens
TOM

All the better
Tom puts his head on Laura’s lap

LAURA
Hey Your hair’s all wet

TOM
What do you expect I swam
halfway across the bay just for
the chance to be alone with you

LAURA
Youre full of it

(CONTTNURFD )

TOM
I’m totally serious

Long pause Laura looks into his eyes Is he just being
charming Or could he mean it

TOM (CONTD)
I owe you an apology

LAURA
It’s okay Let’s not talk about
it

TOM
Okay

Another pause

TOM (CONTD)
But you forgive me

LAURA
Don’t press your luck

More silence but now it’s warm intimate Then Laura
gets her nerve back

LAURA (CONTD)
But you know a head’s up would
have been nice Nothing major
Just a quick e-mail Like I
don’t know ‘hey Laura I know I
saw you last night and countless
others over the last ten years
not excluding the four years we
dated in college the year we got
back together and tried again and
the handful of times we’ve slept
together since So anyway you
know Lila’s in my life now and
though I’ve struggled endlessly
with this predicament I think we
both know the inevitable here so
don’t be surprised when Lila calls
and asks you to be her maid of
honor’

Tom is silent

LAURA (CONTD)
Or here here’s another way you
could have gone Less direct but
same effect ‘Hey Laura great to
see you last night Great movie
Great meal Great sex

(MORE)
(CONTTNUED )

LAURA (CONTD)
But the problem is greatness makes
me sick See you at the wedding’

Tom looks down

LAURA (CONTD)
But then again ten years of
loving friendship and sporadic
though really very good sex
scattered with nights so fun they
explain the evolutionary purpose
of talking not to mention the
time we’ve clocked together
listening to music driving with
no destination Do you remember
when the towers went down We
just stood there on my roof for
God it must have been twenty-four
hours I’m talking about a range
of emotion and experience that
makes certain Russian novels look
painfully boring All of this
fucking beautiful mess is probably
best ended without notification

This one really gets him

TOM
I’m sorry

LAURA
Don’t be It was a gift An act
of cowardice so complete
disqualifies a person from
consideration

Silence Remorse or contrition

TOM
I tried to do what I thought was
right I struggled endlessly
You know I suffered It’s not
like I came at this lightly It
wasn’t some carefree decision

LAURA
Honestly let’s not go there

More silence
TOM

If it makes any difference it was
an accident

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
What was

TOM
Senior year When Lila and I
started dating

LAURA
How exactly do you end up in
someone’s dorm room by accident

TOM
I came back for you To ask your
forgiveness
Laura’s not buying it
LAURA

And then what You accidentally
asked out my roommate

TOM
I guess it doesn’t make a
difference Maybe I should stop
talking

LAURA
Yes I think you should do that

A long pause
LAURA (CONTD)
Did the same thing happen when you
proposed You dial the wrong
number
Tom says nothing
LAURA (CONTD)
Wow a single digit and everything
could have been different

A tentative silence Intimacy warmth slipping

TOM
I was a lifeguard in high-school

LAURA
I remember

TOM
It was my favorite summer job

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
You and every other guy in
America

TOM

I would sit in the chair itching
to leave dying to get in the
water Eight hours later my
shift would end and I would make a
break for it I’d dive in and
stay there hours But the
strangest thing happened when I
got in I felt suddenly panicked

LAURA
Ambivalence is a disease you
know an actual mental illness

TOM
Very funny

LAURA
Let me guess As a kid you’d
order chocolate ice cream then
immediately wish for vanilla

TOM
Come on That’s not what I’m
talking about

LAURA
I get it You’re torn between two
people

TOM

No it’s not that at all I’m
just telling you I prefer swimming
pools I’m afraid of the ocean

LAURA
I‘1ll keep that in mind next time I
swim on your clock

Tom stares They’ve finally reached the brink of
emotional honesty And it makes him feel wild
defensive

TOM
You think you have a special gift
for knowing what’s in my heart
Did it ever occur to you that I
need a woman like Lila

LAURA
What kind of woman is that

(CONTTNURFD )

Laura pauses

A pause

TOM

Someone happy

LAURA

Meaning numb

TOM

Someone practical

LAURA

Meaning busy

TOM

Someone confident

LAURA

Meaning rich

TOM

Someone stable

LAURA
Meaning frigid

TOM
Someone who doesn’t live and die
by her emotions

This hurt

LAURA
So in other words your polar
opposite

TOM
I guess you could say that

LAURA
Haven’t you heard opposites
attract then they bore each other
to death

TOM
Boring is better than maddening

LAURA
Id rather die of excitement

LAURA (CONTD)
Remember that paper junior year

(CONTTNURFD )

TOM
The Hopeless Romantics
Misconceptions of a Movement

LAURA
Only you could start a fifty page
paper the night before

TOM
And still get an A-minus

LAURA
Only because I wrote it

TOM
HardlyOkay maybe half of it

Another pause

LAURA

I do feel sorry for them
TOM

Who
LAURA

All those lovesick poets

TOM
The Romantics weren’t writing
about love They were writing
about death and religion

LAURA
Thanks for clearing that up
genius We took the class
together

TOM
They were just a bunch of confused
kids a collection of freaks and
depressives

LAURA
You need to think that

TOM
No it’s true Love and hysteria
are easily mistaken

Laura smies but she’s not buying it

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
“Forlorn The very word is like a
bell tolling me back from thee to
my sole self”

Tom pauses mesmerized She’s reciting from
John Keats’ “Ode to a Nightingale” the poem
from their college paper No one else in
the world has this power to electrify him
But it’s too intense like eating ice cream
too fast On instinct Tom pulls back

LAURA (CONTD)
What’s the next line

Tom shakes his head

TOM
I can’t remember

LAURA
Liar

TOM
Anyone can make a big romantic
gesture The question is what
happens after

Laura looks away Why does she feel like she’s losing

this argument

TOM (CONT’D)
Do you remember what you said that
night

LAURA
I remember every song we played

TOM
But we only listened to one song
We put “Strangers” on repeat and
played it over and over

LAURA
Oh God I forgot You’re right

TOM
You said it was a perfect night

LAURA
So

TOM
So What the fuck Laura How
am I supposed to top that

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
Was I wrong Was it not an
amazing night

TOM
It was One of many

LAURA
We had so much fun

TOM
No two people have ever had more--
been more fun Nine out of ten
things we did together made my
list of life’s greatest moments

LAURA
So what what was the problem with
that

TOM
I know It’s completely nuts
But every time we had an amazing
night the next morning I’d wake
up in a panic All I could think
was that we could never live up to
it the next time

LAURA
Wow those nuns really fucked you

up

TOM
You try being Catholic

Laura smiles

Tom sits up

TOM (CONTD)
Let’s spare each other a mundane
life of crushing disappointment
Let’s do that with someone else

LAURA
That’s the weakest excuse I’ve
ever heard Just say youre in
love with Lila

TOM
Laura what do you want me to say
That I wish I were marrying you
(MORE)

He is suddenly charged full of emotion

(CONTTNURFD )

TOM (CONTD)
That I’m about to royally fuck my
life that I may no will
definitely spend the next fifty
years regretting this very moment

Laura shrugs says nothing She’s equally charged eyes
wide breathless Her brow is wildly furrowed again a
zig zag of consternation Tom takes note and runs his
hands across her brow Laura melts--butterflies love
sadness

LAURA
We were supposed to be together

TOM
But what if it sucked

LAURA
What IF it sucked

TOM
Some things are so precious it’s
better not to fuck them up

They sit in silence bonded by regret Peace intimacy
contentment shattered

LAURA
I better go I need to tell the
others you’re okay

TOM
But I’m not
Laura gets up
LAURA
Yes you are You chose this

Remember

Laura walks heading towards the Getty’s She’s forcing
herself to keep moving Finally Tom stands and heads
toward the house She turns back watches Tom walk away
then doubles over

INT HAYES HOUSE MARGARET BEDROOM

Minnow tosses and turns in bed Fed up she throws off the
covers and heads into the hallway

INT HAYES HOUSE HALLWAY

Minnow pads down the dark hallway

INT HAYES HOUSE STAIRS

Minnow creeps up the stairs to the attic

INT HAYES HOUSE-ATTIC

Minnow walks into the attic makes her way toward a
closet This is the most likely hiding spot for Lila’s
wedding dress She opens the door Jackpot She
stares mesmerized by its perfection She walks to the

dress extends a hand caresses the satin On an
impulse she reaches up and yanks it off the hanger

INT HAYES HOUSE STAIRS

Tripler and Jake creep up the stairs heading toward the
attic

JAKE
Are you sure this shit isn’t
laced

TRIPLER
I crushed up some of my old
Lithium

Jake coughs violently

TRIPLER (CONTD)
I’m just kidding you wuss

INT ATTIC

Minnow has taken the dress off the hanger and is gingerly
trying it on She is completely rapt a religious
experience Then suddenly she hears footsteps Frantic
she drags the dress in a way that would surely horrify its
owner She trips on her way to the nearest hiding spot
dragging dirt onto the train

Tripler and Jake enter the attic Tripler tugs a string to
light a single bare bulb A loud thud from the back of the
room stops them in their tracks

JAKE
(whispering) What the fuck was
that

Tripler freezes

(CONTTNURFD )

TRIPLER
I’1l never doubt Augusta again

They do a search of the attic checking closets under
tables looking for Tom They don’t see Minnow who is
hiding behind a very large trunk

TRIPLER (CONTD)
He’s not here

JAKE
Nope

TRIPLER
So much for your theory

JAKE
I’1l take the under on Lila’s

Tripler sets up on an old sofa for a quick
replenishment Jake follows suit Minnow
watches wide-eyed

JAKE (CONTD)
I heard you were in a movie

TRIPLER
Yeah

JAKE
That’s cool I’1l have to see it

TRIPLER
It actually never got released
But you can download it off

Tom pads across the living room pauses at the foot of

desperate for clarity

Tripler and Jake are completely wasted talking a mile a

minute

At least you know you have talent
I haven’t done anything worthwhile
since I was eighteen

JAKE
What’d you do when you were
eighteen

TRIPLER

I got into Yale I was headed for
greatness then Now I’m just
headed for a breakdown

JAKE
Come on
TRIPLER
(wincing) I can’t even take credit
for Yale
JAKE
Why not

Tripler pauses Can she admit this

TRIPLER
I cheated on my SAT’s

Jake’s mouth falls open But he tries to soften his
expression

TRIPLER (CONT’D)
We’re such horrible cliches
Everything we say Everything we
do

Jake smiles shakes his head

TRIPLER (CONTD)
Now’s where you say ‘don’t be
silly you are a great actress’
then I say ‘your novel is going
to change the world’

JAKE
Then I say ‘weren’t we supposed
to save the world’

TRIPLER
And then I say ‘the world’s all
gone to shit what does it matter
anyway’

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE

And then we kiss in a desperate

displacement of our need to
connect

Tripler pauses Was that a pass Taking a gamble she

leans in and kisses Jake
Minnow watches in awe
Jake pushes Tripler away

What What’s the big deal

JAKE
Weesie for one And Pete

TRIPLER

God don’t be such an altar

INT GETTY’S HOUSE-LAURA’S BEDROOM

Laura paces in her room agitated Is this really how it’s
going to end She walks to her bag removes her I-PHONE
She opens the internet goes to GOOGLE types something in
Text appears immediately a POEM “ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE’
The line she couldn’t remember

Forlorn The very word is like a
bell tolling me back from thee to

Suddenly new resolve She puts down the phone and hurries
out of the room

Honey no I’m superstitious

She sits next to him gives him a kiss brushes his hair off

his face Tom looks up at the framed photographs on the
wall

TOM (CONT’D)
Those are really good
LILA
Thanks
TOM

Why’d you stop

Lila inhales sharply This cuts to the bone But she’s not

about to indulge a critique Instead she takes command of
the conversation

LILA
Tom youre having a panic attack
It happens to every groom And it
has for the last thousand years

TOM
Don’t patronize me Lila

LILA
I’m just trying to help I’m
nervous too

Tom stares at Lila for a moment seems to make a decision

TOM
You are

We’re getting married It’s kind

of a big deal

TOM
Yes it is
almost smiles
TOM (CONT’D
Lila I love you
LILA
Ilove you too
TOM
Why
LILA

Because you’re smart and charming

and dangerously handsome and you
make me feel safe and happy And

when I’m with you even the most
tedious thing is strangely
weirdly exciting And sometimes

when I look at you across a room

I think you’re some dapper movie
star and then I remember oh my
goodness that’s going to be my
husband

Tom smiles

Thank you sweetie

Why do you love me

know

LILA
I’m going to pretend you didn’t
just say that

TOM
Im just really confused

LILA
Are you really doing this Now

(CONTTNURFD )

ee FH HF

TOM
Isn’t it better now than later

Lila is indignant but Tom looks desperate so she helps

him out

Lila stares into his eyes

LILA
Okay Ill tell you why you love
me Because you don’t trust
yourself Your whole life you’ve

never known who you are or what
you want You’re like a pendulum
swinging wildly between two sides

You need me to keep you still

TOM
We’re so different

Is she going to indulge him or

not

Tom sighs

LILA
Yes we are different And when
you’re not behaving like a total
freak I think that’s what makes
us work

TOM

Youre patronizing me again

LILA
No I’m not

TOM

Youact like emotion is a mental
illness

LILA
(raising her voice for the first
time) It is if you indulge every
single one We’re not children
anymore Tom

This makes perfect sense Maybe he is in the

wrong

Lila looks away as she attempts to control her own nerves

When she looks back

she is a changed women wild with

emotion

LILA (CONTD)
Don’t you think I want to freak

out too Don’t you think I want
to lose my shit How come you get

to be the one who drinks too much

LILA (CONTD)
You get to say outrageous things
Youget to be the one with wild
mood swings You get to be the
artist Did it ever occur to you
that these are freedoms afforded

to you by me

Tom stares at Lila eyes wide

LILA (CONT’D)

Did it ever occur to you that my
emotions are just as intense TI
just work harder to keep them in
check

TOM
But why Why would you do that
You should lose it I wish you
would more I never understood
why you stopped taking pictures
Ijust thought you got bored

LILA
Oh really Who should I lose it
TO My brother My mom You
Take alook around you Tom
Someone’s got to keep their cool

And with this she finally does the opposite--as though
she’s about to implode She lets rip a loud furious oddly

adorable scream

LILA (CONTD)
AHHHHHH

She has come undone--tears streaming hair a mess She has
finally let emotion overwhelm Then just as quickly as she

allowed herself to ‘lose it’ she puts herself back together

again

Tom is suitably cowed

TOM
I’m sorry Sweetie I’ve been an
ass

LILA

Yes you have You really have

TOM
Im sorry

(CONTTNURFD )

HH

HH FH

LILA
I just need you to hold it
together for twelve more hours

Can you do that for me

TOM
Yes I think I can

LILA
Good now go find Jake and Pete

and have agood talk before you

cause us any more bad luck

Tom smiles

Im sorry

LILA
Don’t be I love you

TOM
Ilove you too

LILA
Now shoo

He gets up and leaves the room The sight of Lila wild

with emotion in a BLUE FACE MASK no less is funny human

and in some way weirdly beautiful Realizing this she

picks up her cameraand SNAPS A SELF PORTRAIT

She smiles

This feels good

INT GETTY’S HOUSE

Pete and Weesie stand at the front door wearing TOWELS

Are they really going to do this

PETE
We don’t really have to do this

WEESIE
Yeah let’s not

PETE
Funny idea though

Long pause

WEESIE
No way You’re not getting off
that easy

(CONTTNURFD )

FH

She grabs his TOWEL and drops her own And suddenly
they’re sprinting across the lawn buck naked shrieking and
laughing

INT ATTIC

Tripler and Jake make their way out of the attic

Minnow watches from behind the TRUNK heart pounding
Then suddenly bad luck a SNEEZE She tries to
suppress it but no use ACHOO Tripler and Jake freeze
then approach the noise They are greeted by an eerie
image a tiny figure dwarfed by a wedding dress several
sizes too large At first glance it looks like a
ghost risen from the grave In the commotion the
figure trips and falls ripping the WEDDING DRESS by
accident

Jake turns bolts down the stairs

EXT HAYES LAWN

Weesie and Pete lie in the grass laughing hysterically
Pete’s TOWEL is nearby on the ground Suddenly Weesie sits

up

WEESIEE
Oh God What time is it I was
supposed to be in Lila’s room at
midnight

PETE
Well that’s convenient

She runs up the lawn enters the house through the porch
grabs a THROW off the living room SOFA

Pete lies naked on the lawn just as Jake sprints out the
front door

JAKE
What the fuck

PETE
Dude

Jake points and laughs

PETE (CONT’D)
Shut up and give me your shirt

He complies and the two start back across the lawn They
make quite the pair as they traipse back one without pants
the other without a shirt

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

Lila finishes washing the BLUE MASK of her face She exits
the bathroom and enters her bedroom

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

She looks at her watch Her friends are over an hour late

Now she’s completely stirred up What could they be doing

INT THIRD FLOOR LANDING

Tripler retreats from the attic totally shaken She will
have to pass Lila’s room

LILA
Hello Who is that

Tripler remains still trying to mute her breathing

LILA (CONT’D)
Laura Tripler You guys are late

The door swings open
TRIPLER
Just me
INT LILA’S BEDROOM

Tripler enters Lila’s room Lila is consumed with
suspicion

LILA
You said you would be here at
midnight

TRIPLER

I’m sorry We’re assholes
druggies losers

Lila says nothing takes a seat on her bed Tripler stands
awkwardly

LILA
Whereis everyone

TRIPLER

We all had so much to drink I doubt
they’re still standing

(CONTTNURFD )

LILA
How drunk was Tom when you left him

TRIPLER
Completely

LILA
And Laura

TRIPLER

No worse than the rest

LILA
Well where is she now

TRIPLER
Hell if I know Probably passed out
on the lawn That girl can’t hold
her liquor like she used to

Lila nods slowly It’s worse than she thought None of

this bodes well And woman’s intuition tells her Tripler’s

not telling the truth

A knock on the door It’s Weesie She enters the room
naked but for a THROW

WEESIEE
I’m so sorry

LILA
It’s fine Where’s Laura

Weesie looks to Tripler What has she said

WEESTIEE
(lying badly) God I don’t know

Tripler eyes her instructively

WEESTEE (CONTD)

Oh wait I saw her heading for
the house an hour ago Said she
was gonna turn in early

Lila nods Suspicion has turned to panic Something is

definitely amiss Tripler tries to change the subject

TRIPLER
(to Weesie) So what’s with the
toga

WEESTIE
Don’t ask

(CONTTNURFD )

The girls finally acknowledge Weesie’s half-naked state and
burst into hysterical laughter But Lila can’t relax What

are her friends hiding

EXT HAYES LAWN

Laura traipses across the lawn heading for the OAK TREE
Maybe he’s come back for her Unlikely but worth a shot

EXT HAYES LAWN-FURTHER UP

Tom leaves the house with new purpose He won’t make the
same mistake twice

EXT LAWN-OAK TREE

Laura stands by the tree waiting looking But she second-
guesses herself This is crazy She turns to go back to
the Getty’s disheartened

But then she hears faint music It’s “Strangers’ by the
Kinks Tom’s got it playing on his I-PHONE Here’s his Big
Romantic Gesture Then he tops it

They run to each other Kissing crying passion

Tom whispers the rest of the poem in Laura’s ear Extreme
close-up

TOM
Forlorn The very word is like a
bell to toll me back from thee to
my sole self Adieu The fancy
cannot cheat so well as she is
famed to do deceiving elf
Adieu adieu thy plaintive anthem
fades past the near meadows over
the still stream up the hillside
and now tis buried deep in the
next valley glades Was ita
vision or a waking dream Fled is
that music--do I wake or sleep

They pull apart for a moment
TOM (CONTD)
(whispering) I’1l love you

forever Will you love me
forever

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
(whispering) I’1l love you
forever

More kissing crying passion

They pull apart and Tom heads for the tree seizes the
BOTTLE OF BOURBON He takes off the cap they both take a
sip then turn it upside down

Finally the clouds make good on their promise At
the first drop Tom and Laura rush to each other
kiss passionately

As they hold each other Laura’s BLACK SASH comes off and is
cast to the side unnoticed

EXT GETTY’S LIVING ROOM
Weesie and Tripler enter to find Jake and Pete on the sofa

PETE
Any luck

WEESIE
No You

They shake their heads solemnly

PETE

All hope rests in Chip and Laura
WEESIE

That’s not good
JAKE

I’m sure Chip and Laura have found
him by now

WEESIE
If they’re even still together

TRIPLER
Lila’s going to kill us

Finally the inevitable explosion

PETE
We’re telling her now

TRIPLER
No way She’ll freak

(CONTTNURFD )

PETE
That would be an appropriate
response
WEESIE
Why are you trying to cover your
butt
TRIPLER

Cover my butt I did nothing wrong

JAKE
Chill out you guys I say we wait
until dawn Give Tom a few more
hours There’s no point in getting
Lila worked up if we can avoid it

The group is silent

TRIPLER
All those in favor of telling her
now

Pete and Weesie raise their hands

TRIPLER (CONTD)
All those in favor of waiting

Jake and Tripler raise their hands

WEESIE
Fine let’s just wait until it’s
light

Resolved the girls join the boys on the sofa

EXT HAYES LAWN-NIGHT

Chip wakes up in pouring rain How and when did he get here
Staggering he makes his way up the lawn But he stops in his
tracks as he passes the OAK TREE sees Tom and Laura Laura
looks up and they make eye contact Chip keeps walking

EXT HAYES LAWN--MORNING

The camera surveys the toll taken by the storm One of the
tent poles has come unearthed causing the tent to sag in
the middle A few table cloths have scattered on the lawn
along with a BOTTLE OF BOURBON

But the clouds are gone and the sky is bright The lawn has
turned from mint to emerald The storm has magnified the
beauty of the house Augusta could not have planned it
better

EXT OAK TREE

Laura lies asleep contented wakes up to the sound of a
bird For a moment she’s confused Then it all comes back

Tom’s gone But where is he

She grabs her things and starts back toward the Getty’s
trying to make sense of her night As she peers ahead a
figure emerges her four friends silhouetted by the water
They meet in the middle

TRIPLER
Have you seen him

Laura looks down

WEESIE
Us either We’re telling Lila now

They continue walking

LAURA
Wait a second

They stop

WEESIE
What is it

Laura says nothing

TRIPLER
Where were you anyway

LAURA
Where were you

Tripler stares suspicious

TRIPLER
Oh my God You saw him

WEESIE
Trip leave her alone

TRIPLER
What She did

WEESIE
Why do you think that

TRIPLER
Because Laura can’t lie for shit

(CONTTNURFD )

Laura stares at her friend silent

TRIPLER (CONTD)
Where did you sleep Fess up

LAURA
Where did you sleep Or should I
say whose husband did you sleep
with

They stare at each other for a moment Finally Weesie takes
command

WEESIEE
We don’t have time for this right
now

She starts walking again heading toward the house The
others linger then follow

EXT HAYES LAWN

Augusta emerges in a silk bathrobe She marches to the
tree checks the BOTTLE finds it empty Enraged she scans
the lawn for the culprit Then she sees Laura’s BLACK
SASH Little harlot

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

Lila awakes in a confusion of emotion elation terror
relief She emerges from bed faces herself in the mirror

She removes the photo of Lauraand Tom from the drawer rips

it in half and throws it in the garbage

She exits the room making a beeline for the attic She is
suddenly consumed by a burning need to see her wedding
dress

INT HALLWAY

Lila hurries across the hall

INT STAIRS

Lila climbs up the stairs to the attic

INT ATTIC

Lila sees her dress and sighs with relief It is as
beautiful as she remembers Even as she gets closer
she fails to notice the damage But as she examines it
the dress reveals a hideous rip It is torn at the seam

between bodice and skirt She immediately knows the
culprit

(CONTTNURFD )

LILA
Minnow

INT AUGUSTA BEDROOM
Augusta jumps startled
INT MINNOW BEDROOM

Minnow sits up in bed panicked She darts from her bed and
sprints up the stairs

INT HALLWAY
Augusta heads towards the attic
INT ATTIC

Augusta arrives to find Lilahovering over the dress

LILA
Look what she did

Augusta embraces Lila

AUGUSTA
It can be fixed There’s still
plenty of time

INT STAIRS

Minnow overhears and freezes

INT ATTIC

Lila hears the footsteps and starts toward the door
screaming threats arms flailing Augusta restrains Lila

just long enough to give Minnow a healthy lead But Lila
escapes within seconds and starts down the stairs

INT STAIRS

Minnow sprints down the stairs only a pace
ahead of Lila

Lila catches a piece of her sister’s nightgown But gravity
conspires with Minnow propelling her down with a small
advantage

INT KITCHEN

Minnow speeds through the kitchen trailed by Lila

INT LIVING ROOM
Minnow sprints through the living room trailed by Lila
EXT PORCH

Minnow emerges on the porch where the wedding
party is gathering

She disappears into the throng while Lila faces her friends
The group stand on the porch awkwardly waiting for the right
time to talk

EXT LAWN

Minnow lights out across the lawn hooting and gloating
Everyone watches trying not to laugh

EXT PORCH

Lila is doing her very best to regain composure She is
succeeding but her struggle is apparent Tripler steps
towards Lila

TRIPLER
Li there’s something we have to tell
you

LILA

Don’t tell me it’s going to rain

TRIPLER
Nope

She nods cheerfully at the sky as though she alone arranged
for the weather

LILA
What is it

Tripler looks to Weesie for help Lila scans her friends

PETE
Tom’s missing

LILA
What No he’s not

WEESIE
Yes Li Listen

TRIPLER

After the rehearsal dinner we went
down to the water

(CONTTNURFD )

JAKE
Pete smuggled booze from the club

PETE
Dude we did it together

TRIPLER
Someone got the idea to get on the
float We hung out there for a
while drinking being stupid All
the sudden we looked up and
realized we’d drifted out

WEESIE
So we broke into pairs and swam back
to shore And when we made it
back

Long pause

TRIPLER
Tom didn’t

WEESIE
We need to call the police Before
it gets any later

Lila stares at her friends while she digests the
information

LILA
Guys this sounds like quite an
adventure and I hate to ruin the
ending But I saw Tom

WEESIE
What

JAKE
I knew it

LAURA

You did When
Laura is clearly more shocked than the rest

ILA
In my room Last night

LAURA
What time

sILA
I don’t know Pretty late

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
Oh

WEESIE
Are you kidding me That’s great

Laura smiles but she’s obviously heartbroken Everyone
else is laughing relieved--huge deep breath

WEESIE (CONTD)
But where is he now

PETE
Don’t even start

JAKE
He can fend for himself from now
on

LILA

There he is
The group follows her gaze down the lawn
EXT LAWN
And there is Tom approaching slowly backlit by the sun
He greets the crowd with a dapper wave like a magician
emerging from a box

EXT PORCH

Everyone watches eyes narrowed as though beholding an
apparition

Lila smiles and sprints to meet him Laura watches in
disbelief

EXT LAWN

Lila reaches Tom and throws herself into his arms They
pull apart and head toward the porch arm in arm

Laura stares at Tom He avoids her eyes Finally he looks
at her--it’s almost imperceptible--then looks away But the
look speaks volumes

LILA
I told you he went for a walk

A hearty laugh from the group

(CONTTNURFD )

WEESIE
Oh no It’s bad luck for you guys
to see each other before the
wedding

TRIPLER
Shut up Weez

ANNIE
Yeah shut up

And with that the subject of Tom’s disappearance is
permanently dropped

EXT HAYES PORCH

Lila arrives on the porch carrying the damaged wedding dress
in her arms like a wounded soldier A massive sewing box
balanced on her lap she begins mending the rip Even with
pins and needles tucked between her teeth she still looks
calm and graceful Lila is renewed in her confidence This
is what she’s best at solving problems restoring order

EXT HAYES LAWN

The group wander back toward the house weary from the
night’s events

Weesie catches up with Jake and grabs his hand
Pete puts his arm around Tripler
JAKE
Group pact To forget everything

that was said and done last night

PETE
Why What did you do

TRIPLER
No worse than you

WEESIE
Good idea sweetie

PETE
Group pact

TRIPLER
Group pact

JAKE
Group pact

EXT HAYES LAWN-FURTHER BACK CLOSER TO THE HAYES
Laura walks by herself totally crushed

CHIP
Laura Hey wait up

Laura turns barely stops walking
CHIP (CONTD)
I’m sorry about last night I was

out of line

LAURA
Yeah you were

CHIP
Maybe I do need that ankle bracelet

Laura doesn’t laugh
CHIP (CONTD)

Seriously Laur I messed up I’m

sorry I let you down
Laura smiles--forgiveness She keeps on walking
EXT HAYES PORCH
Lila sits triumphant The dress is mended The sky is
blue Everything is in its place She surveys the lawn as

trio of servers hurry across Blue and green ribbons dance
at the tent poles marrying the lawn and the ocean

INT GETTY’S GIRLS’ BATHROOM

The girls groom as they did before only more exhausted
Weesie uses the blow dryer while Tripler puts drops in her
eyes Laura takes a spot at the sink splashes her face
with cold water Her eyes are red blotchy Then a peace
offering--Tripler hands her the EYE-DROPS Laura smiles
These girls can’t stay mad at each other for long

EXT HAYES LAWN

Augusta strides across the porch and begins her final scan
We follow as she canvasses the grounds First the parking
lot where early arrivals have begun to assemble Then
around to the lawn Neat clumps of servers dressed in
black assorted members of the family dressed in pastel
Augusta’s dress is a radiant red that makes her look twenty
years younger

Now we’re inside the tent where silver is set flowers
open resplendent

(CONTTNURFD )

Then were out of the tent as Augusta strides past the chairs
set up for the ceremony Finally she looks up to the house
takes in the enormity of her accomplishment The sky is
blue the air is clear Nothing can tarnish her triumph not
a damaged wedding dress not the groom not the weather

INT HAYES HOUSE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE LILA’S BEDROOM

The girls arrive at Lila’s bedroom in their bridesmaid
dresses knock on the door

INT LILA’S BEDROOM

The door flies open revealing Lila in bustier and heels
She has recovered herself--and then some Whatever she

suspects or has concluded she has put it out of her head
Today is her wedding day God damn it

LILA
I swear to God I forgot this
thing had seven thousand hooks

Weesie rushes to her aid and gets to work on the
buttons

As the girls stand together Lila’s color scheme reveals its
magic Together they look like a string of pearls

LILA (CONT’D)
How’s the make-up

WEESIE
Revolting

LILA
The hair

TRIPLER
Trashy

LILA
You’ve seen the dress

TRIPLER
Tacky choice

They smile hug stamp their feet--feeling the excitement
Laura does her best to play along

The moment is interrupted as the door opens revealing
Minnow

She runs across the room into Lila’s arms joining the
huddle

(CONTTNURFD )

LILA

Shit I left the bouquets
downstairs Could someone grab
them

LAURA
I will

Laura rushes out relieved by the chance to be alone
EXT HALLWAY AND STAIRS
Laura heads toward the basement

INT BASEMENT

Laura descends the basement stairs calmed by the
darkness She opens the fridge the only light in the
room and finds the requested bouquets four small ones
and Lila’s enormous one She removes the flowers and
heads up the stairs with new determination

INT LIVING ROOM

Lila is in the ritual stance her dress draped over a chair
as she stands at the other end of the room The girls hover
like hornets around a rose A photographer follows their
every move pretending to be inconspicuous

LAURA
Lila

LILA

There you are Thank God We were
starting to think you’d run off
with those

Laura releases the bouquets Lila looks out the window with
nostalgia But a click from the camera reveals it was just a
pose

LAURA
I owe you an apology

LILA
It’s fine You’re just in time

LAURA
No not about the flowers Something
else

Long pauseThrougout Lila remains--or feigns--total
distraction She is consumed with the task of untangling a
necklace whose chain has become horribly knotted

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA (CONTD)
I saw Tom last night

LILA
That’s nice Did you two get a
chance to catch up

LAURA
I mean I found him when he was
missing

LILA
Good for you

LAURA

What I’m trying to say is Tom wasn’t
lost He was hiding

LILA
Yes he told me about his meltdown

LAURA

Let me try this another way Tom
wasn’t alone last night He was with
me We were together

Lila stares at Laura finally honoring her with her
full attention Butonly for a moment She won’t
give her the satisfaction of flinching She
proceeds feigning nonchalance

LILA
Was that before or after he came to
my room

LAURA

I don’t know What time was that

LILA
Must have been well past midnight I
was actually expecting you

LAURA
He was with me before And after

LILA

(snapping) Laura why are you telling
me this This doesn’t concern me

LAURA
It doesn’t concern you

(CONTTNURFD )

LILA
He’s a groom I would be concerned
if he wasn’t a wreck the night before
his wedding

LAURA
But what if he was in love with
someone else Would that concern
you

Lila says nothing for several seconds She speaks when
she’s good and ready

LILA
You have spent the last ten years
competing with me You want what I
have This motivates you

LAURA
This has nothing to do with you
This is totally separate

ILA
Nothing you do is separate from me

LAURA
Lila I’m in love with Tom

sILA
I know And I feel sorry for you

LAURA

I’ve lived with these feelings for
ten years now I’ve tried everything
to get them out of my system but
nothing--not time not other guys
other cities--nothing makes them
lessen atall People say it gets
better with time But I haven’t
found thatto be true If anything
the more time goes by the more I
miss him

ILA
Aw isn’t that sweet

LAURA
It’s out of my control

sILA

Unrequited love is the perfect
romantic construct It allows two
cowardly people to act out a fantasy
of love without any real
consequences

(CONTTNURFD )

LAURA
He feels this way too Lila He
always has and you know it How can
you marry him knowing he feels this
way about me Our relationship was
never over when you guys got
together

LILA
All of this is certainly tragic and
debatably interesting But
unfortunately for you it doesn’t
matter anymore He’s marrying me in
ten minutes

The photographer emerges at this moment and snaps a photo of

the two friends Lila smiles with chilling indifference then

turns to face the others

LILA (CONTD)
For God’s sake can I move yet

Before anyone can answer Augusta arrives and dismisses
Lila The chairs are filling The boys are assembled
It is time to process

EXT HAYES LAWN--WEDDING

Seen through Laura’s perspective the wedding procession is
warped and distorted The chatter of two-hundred-fifty
guests is loud then distant People blur and regain focus
as though she’s wearing faulty glasses

The groomsmen stand outside the back door jostling like
horses They greet the bridesmaids with enthusiasm Then
without warning Laura is being pushed into line Chip
appears and offers his elbow

She is pulled towards escalating music as sound drifts in
and out She sees chairs faces a kaleidoscope of color
She files into her appointed spot forgetting her assigned
position until Chip nudges her into place

And there is Tom in a morning coat in the midst of this
ghastly vision Then the crowd hushes and all sound goes out

as Lila begins her procession Lila glides across the grass

the human embodiment of perfection And then out of
nowhere on her perfect bare shoulder a RAINDROP

EXT LAWN--NEAR ALTAR

Tripler and Weesie whip their heads around to look at one
another

(CONTTNURFD )

TRIPLER
Did you feel that

WEESIE
What

She waits for confirmation One lands on her arm

WEESIE (CONT’D)
No I didn’t

Laura feels one on her neck She looks up to the sky It
has darkened in a matter of minutes

Mr Hayes lifts Lila’s veil She smiles and kisses him on
cue She takes her position next to Tom The reverend
clears his throat and begins his sermon

REVEREND BARTLETT
When I first met Tom McDevon it
was on a day much like today A
day so glorious it provided final
irrefutable proof that God
existsOr at least that Augusta
had a word with him

The guests resound with polite laughter

REVEREND
Augusta had invited me over for tea
and we were catching up on the
porch Tom arrived after a long
trip from New York And let me
tell you the look on his face when
he saw Lila was unlike any look--
and I’ve seen many in my day--any
look I’ve ever seen when a man
greets a woman

Laura scans the crowd It’s like watching a movie with
her hands over her eyes

REVEREND (CONTD)
I’ve known Lila forever Since she
was a towhead running around the
club It will come as no surprise
that she was an adorable child long
before she was a beautiful young
woman And yet I have never seen
her look more radiant mor
delighted more certain of her
place in the world than she did
that day as she greeted Tom in the
driveway of this house

(MORE )

(CONTTNURFD )

REVEREND (CONTD)
These two are not only graced with
an abundance of earthly gifts they
have been blessed with everlasting
love

Laura keeps her eyes on the guests anxious for their
interpretation But their smiles confirm her worst fear
They agree with the minister

REVEREND (CONTD)
Love is like the ocean Vast
seemingly endless

He pauses to allow a chuckle

REVEREND (CONTD)
Rocky at times Peaceful at
others Daunting for all its
unexplored depths But a constant
source of wonder and amazement

Laura sighs It is certain It’s really
going to happen

REVEREND (CONTD)
Marriage is like a raft Imperfect
but sound so long as the builders
continuously fortify the structure
and once afloat strive for
balance

The guests reward the awkward metaphor with a
saccharine sigh

Laura looks on defeated She scans the crowd with new
awareness It’s time to move on from this life these
people

REVEREND (CONTD)
Now if you will turn to page three-
hundred-and-fifty-seven I would
like to read from First
Corinthians chapter thirteen
verse four

A rustle of pages

REVEREND (CONT’D)
(reading) Love is patient Love is
kind and envies no one Love is
never boastful nor conceited nor
rude nor selfish not quick to
take offense There is nothing
love cannot face
(MORE)

(CONTTNURFD )

REVEREND (CONTD)
There is no limit to its faith its
hope its endurance In a word
there are three things that last
forever Faith hope and love but
the greatest of them all is love

He pauses with decorous formality

Tom looks

REVEREND (CONTD)
Tom and Lila have written their own
vows in an expression of their
creativity

LILA
Tom you surprise me all the time
Maybe once a day Just when I
think I know everything there is to
know you say or do something that
levels me

up strangely at Lila What does she know about

Laura

LILA (CONTD)

Ilove this about you You keep me
thinking wondering alert alive I

also hate this about you Every once

inawhile I am forced to question
everything I know to be true about
you If a person can surprise you so
completely

She trails off thoroughly disheartened almost

asurrender

Tom looks

LILA (CONT’D)
But love is nothing if not a
recurring act of forgiveness No
man no woman is perfect Tom We
will always err stray disappoint
The challenge is to choose the person

who will will lift us up not pull us

down in between these shocking and
disappointing betrayals

down She knows

Laura stomachs despair as Lila concludes

LILA (CONT’D)

Ihave chosen you Tom And you have

chosen me I promise to try to lift
youup And I expect the same of
ou

She has lost two

loves in one night

painfully long awkward silence the Reverend eyes Tom
urgently Your turn Buster

TOM
Lila I look at you And I’m
speechless I literally have
nothing to say

Tom pauses stares at the ground as though he’s counting
blades of grass

TOM (CONT’D)
Words fail the depth and complexity

have nothing to offer Words are
my only riches Words

He trails off again this time for even longer He
looks from the grass to Lila breathless like a runner
at the end of a race

LILA
Maybe I should say it for you

TOM
I’m sorry I can’t do this

And then without warning it starts to rain Rain pours
down from the sky in sheets A lightning bolt bisects the
bay sending horrified guests running toward the wedding
tentAugusta stands still in defiance like the captain of

asinking ship

And inside a second the seven friends are doing what they
do best running Weesie rushes to Lila trying to rescue
the train Tripler follows always game for a thrill The
boys start an impromptu race Tom and Laura freeze
exchange a glance Hard to tell if it’s a look of
disappointment or solidarity

Just as they weren’t quite ready to graduate these friends
are not quite ready to tie the knot These friends these
hopeless romantics are not quite ready to be adults And
so they scatter and put it off for just one more day

The wedding photographer catches this moment in a
beautifully chaotic image

It might as well be the same photo snapped on graduation
day In it everyone is caught--ironically--in a state of

flight
