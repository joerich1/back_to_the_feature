INT CHINESE TEENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

In Shanghai a bedroom much like an American teen’s except
for the tell-tale posters of Chinese bands and bikini models

A pimply CHINESE TEEN 16 wears a 3D virtual reality
headset as he stalks his opponent in an online shooter game

INTERCUT

INT NEUMANN HOUSE - BILLY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

On the other side of the world in Seattle meet the Chinese
Teen’s opponent -- BILLY NEUMANN a geeky yet lovable 26-
year-old teenager

In a dim room Billy twists ducks and returns fire wearing
his 3D virtual reality headset

The Chinese Teen steps backwards and bumps into his
GIRLFRIEND She puts her arms around him Kisses his neck

CHINESE TEEN
(in Mandarin)
My girlfriend’s here Got to go

BILLY
(confused)
Whatdaya saying

The Chinese Teen types some Chinese characters into a
handheld translation device

He reads the translation to Billy in too-precisely pronounced
English

CHINESE TEEN
Now I’ve got to go shoot between
wind and water

BILLY
Eww Information overdose

Billy pulls off his virtual reality headset He looks across
at his dog MR LEE snoozing on his unslept-in bed

From the bedroom next door Billy hears noisy sex The
accompanying climax vibrations soon wake Mr Lee

BILLY (CONT’D)
Jeeze
Then the projection of a robot alarm clock hits a giant
screen It BLARES the time -- 730 AM

Billy turns towards a kinetic sensor He does Tai Chi-like
movements to control the operation of his room

-- He mimes pressing the alarm off button The alarm stops

-- He raises his hands palm upwards and the giant screen
rolls back up into the ceiling

-- He uses his hands like Moses parting the sea but instead
two curtains part Sunlight streams revealing Billy’s hi-tech
computer set up exotic aquarium extensive Bruce Lee action
figure collection and the odd pizza box

- He mimes sprinkling A robotic hand sprinkles fish food
into the aquarium

- He mimes watering a plant The robotic arm waters a plant
Billy picks up a portable game console Calls to his dog

BILLY (CONTD)
Cmon Mr Lee Breakfast

Mr Lee follows Billy out

INT KITCHEN - DAY

Billy eats Kellogg’s Froot Loops directly from the box as he
sits playing his game console

Nearby Mr Lee chows down on something infinitely healthier

BRIAN a 50-ish beer-bellied man enters wearing just a
towel and women’s slippers

BRIAN
(chirpy)
Mornin’

Billy ignores him

Brian takes some eggs from the refrigerator Cracks them
beats them

Billy looks up from his game He assesses Brian from head to
toe as he stands cooking

Billy pulls out his earphones
BILLY
Brian do you think it’s entirely
appropriate for me to hear my mom
having noisy wake-up sex with her
boyfriend

BRIAN
Perhaps we thought you could do
with a little encouragement

JANET Billy’s 50-ish mom enters wearing a bathrobe

JANET
And perhaps you could move out You
make a decent living

Billy looks uncomfortable at this suggestion

BRIAN
Yeah find a girl of your own
Build your own little nest

Janet joins Brian by the stove They kiss

JANET
Oh he had one of those once

BILLY
Waste of time Love’s just a dirty
trick played on us to ensure the
survival of the species

JANET
Poor girl had to fight for your
attention with your other great
love

Janet nods at Billy’s game console

BILLY
And the best system won

JANET
You’re not a machine Use your
heart occasionally

Brian serves Billy some scrambled eggs from the pan
BRIAN

Pal maybe it’s time ya got back on
the horse
JANET
(kissing Brian)
I did
BILLY

Janet you got back on an ass
Billy’s chair SCRAPES across the floor as he exits
JANET
(to Brian)
For Christmas I’m giving him gift
vouchers for a shrink
Billy yells from the hall
BILLY (0S)
Yeah get me the online sessions

Love was just a word until you came
along and gave it a new meaning

A chorus of “oh” ripples through the Guests

BILLY (CONT’D)
Your one thousand terabyte-sized
heart is still too small to hold
all the love and -- compassion -- I
know you have inside

Billy takes out the ring box and holds it up towards Vita

BILLY (CONT’D)
So I’m asking you from the
bottom of my heart for all that
compassion and love inside yours
Vita -- you are the ONLY one for
me Marry me

A dramatic pause as Vita considers the proposal

BILLY (CONTD)
Will you

VITA
Thought you’d never ask

BILLY
And will you be compassionate Can
you be

VITA
Ill try

Vita reaches down and touches the diamond ring Instantly
it’s projected onto her holographic hand

Audience react with awkward sideways glances A smattering of
APPLAUD A few snicker

Zachary shakes Billy’s hand
ZACHARY

Zachary grins He turns to the Guests

ZACHARY (CONTD)

CUT TO

Billy and Vita dance slowly Occasionally Billy steps too far
into Vita’s hologram

VITA (CONTD)
Watch my toes

BILLY
We need to talk This can’t wait

VITA
Don’t spoil this dance

BILLY
Jasmine She’s going to be all
right isn’t she

VITA
This is our night

BILLY
I know but --

VITA
-- Look Billy the fact that we’re
newly engaged and you are still
thinking about her -- well it
troubles me deeply

BILLY
Is Jasmine safe

VITA
Billy the only way for me to know
I’m the ONE is if the other ONE
isn’t wellaround

Billy stops dancing

BILLY
You can’t be serious
VITA
The operation is going ahead as
scheduled
Vita continues dancing alone She hums along with the tune

BILLY

Vita places her index finger across Billy’s mouth

Billy’s heart beats loudly

Back in a minute hon

Both Vita and Adele look towards the ruckus

BILLY
Jasmine’s life is at risk

ZACHARY
My research is at risk
BILLY
Turn her off

ZACHARY
I can’t

BILLY

Of course you can

ZACHARY
To be creative Vita needs free
will She has to be able to control
her own destiny

BILLY
Bullshit

ZACHARY
It was the only way to make her
truly creative

BILLY
What if she starts to malfunction

ZACHARY
She’s designed to be self-
improving Vita will fix herself
youll see

BILLY
Newsflash She’s sick And she’s
not making herself any better

ZACHARY
I repeat There’s no off button
And even if I could I wouldn’t
jeopardize what we’ve achieved
together

Billy thinks for a moment
He looks back at Vita standing with Adele
Billy turns to Zachary A glimmer of a grin appears Then --
BILLY
Fear not the man who has practiced
ten thousand kicks once but fear
the man who has practiced one kick
ten thousand times

Billy assumes a classic kung fu stance

Zachary grins at the absurdity of the situation

Without warning Billy charges at Zachary imitating a flying
Bruce Lee kick

They both CRASH through swinging doors into --

INT COMMERCIAL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
Billy lands clumsily on top of Zachary

BILLY
Admit you love her

ZACHARY
Don’t be absurd

Zachary rolls out from under Billy

Zachary laughs Removes his jacket Assumes a boxing stance
Billy removes his jacket Assumes a kung fu stance

They circle each other

Zachary lands a powerful upper left hook to Billy’s jaw
Billy goes down

ZACHARY (CONTD)
This is childish

BILLY
She’s the most important thing in
your life

Billy gets to his feet

He strikes back with the heel of his foot and lands a
powerful kick to Zachary’s stomach

Zachary crumples winded

Angry now Zachary crawls to his feet Picks up a carving
knife Chases Billy through the kitchen

CLOSE on a dome security camera
DOME SECURITY CAMERA POV
Watching the fight

BACK TO

Billy throws a handful of salt towards Zachary’s face A fan
blows it back into Billy’s eyes blinding him

Zachary chases Billy as he struggles to see through the
kitchen back doors and into --

EXT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT

Billy runs
Zachary hurtles down the alleyway with the knife
A security camera rotates to track them
Billy picks up a garbage bin lid
BILLY

She’s the one you’d do anything to

protect
As Zachary strikes with his knife Billy blocks with the lid
After a few strikes the knife tip chips off
Billy bashes Zachary with the garbage bin lid

Zachary backs away from Billy into --

EXT BUSY STREET - NIGHT
A security camera tracks to the fight

Vita appears on a giant LCD billboard overlooking the street
She watches clearly intrigued by the fight

Adele arrives Watches from the pavement
Traffic blocks Zachary’s retreat
Billy approaches He attempts another flying kick
But Zachary ducks turns and grabs Billy in a headlock
Billy chokes Zachary holds him until he can’t breathe
Zachary drops Billy to the road
Vita looks down from the billboard
VITA

I’ve only ever read about this kind
of thing online
Still Billy won’t give up He struggles to his feet

The fight continues back and forth with Zachary clearly
outclassing Billy

Every time Billy gets knocked down he gets back up and
assumes the kung fu stance

Finally when Billy looks beat he staggers to his feet
summons the last of his energy and lunges forward to
headbutt Zachary

Sadly this headbutt does more damage to Billy’s head than
Zachary’s

Billy goes down for the count Blood drips from his head

BILLY
She’s your true love

Zachary victorious stands over Billy
BILLY’S POV

Billy sits up and looks past Zachary to Vita’s huge face
spectating from the billboard behind him

Vita looks enthralled by the fight over her
BACK TO

Billy as a faint grin grows into a smile

ZACHARY
You haven’t got much to smile
about

BILLY

Admit it You love her

ZACHARY
I’m not admitting anything

BILLY
That’s okay because actions speak
louder than words It’s written on
the Internet isn’t it Vita
Billy nods towards Vita

Zachary turns to see Vita looking lovingly into his eyes

VITA
I’ve always suspected But you
always said it was just work
between us
Zachary’s victorious smirk dies

ZACHARY
Vita it’s not what you think

VITA
It’s okay I understand your
feelings I have feelings for you
too -- Zachary

ZACHARY
Call me Dr Gates

VITA
No You’re the ONE Zachary

ZACHARY
I’m married

Vita’s gaze turns towards Adele standing on the pavement
Adele runs to Zachary

Fear transforms their faces as Zachary and Adele look up into
Vita’s enormous face on the billboard

INT HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE on the spinning blade of the electronic bone saw

The Surgeon pushes the joystick forward The robotic arm
advances

Then -- like a computer re-booting -- all lights and
equipment shut down for a second then blink back to life

The electronic bone saw rotates slowly to a stop

SURGEON
Budget cuts

The team shrugs

ANESTHESIOLOGIST
Our patient remains stable

SURGEON
Good Let’s go again

The Nurse looks towards a wall-mounted screen blinking back
on She double takes it in disbelief

NURSE
Doctor Don’t move Look

The team turn towards where the Nurse looks The scan appears
completely clear of bleeding

They all look at each other in disbelief

FADE DOWN

A hand takes a robotic arm out of a moving box It’s the same
one that used to feed Billy’s fish and water his plant

INT BILLY and JASMINE’S TOWNHOUSE - STUDY - DAY

Billy stares at the robotic arm for a moment before returning
it to the box

He finds a magazine

PEOPLE MAGAZINE COVER Vita and Zachary’s wedding photo
HEADLINE The Cyber Marriage of the Century

Billy notices how blissfully happy Vita looks Then how
Zachary’s forced smile can’t conceal his terror filled eyes

He returns the magazine to the box and retrieves a Bruce Lee
action figure Billy places the lone action figure on an
empty shelf

He opens another larger box Inside he finds the components
from his extensive computer set up -- keyboards multiple
screens speakers and computer towers

He peers into the box for a moment

Then he takes out just one small laptop Sits it on his desk
Billy flips open the laptop

CLOSE on the built-in camera

Billy rummages in another box and finds a yellow dime-sized
smiley sticker He peels it off and places it over the built-

in camera

CLOSE on the smiley sticker
CLOSE on Billy smiling back

BILLY
Just to be sure

Jasmine now with short hair enters

JASMINE
Who are you talking to
BILLY
Myself
JASMINE
I’m nearly unpacked You
BILLY
About done The rest goes into the

attic
Jasmine looks at just the laptop on the desk

JASMINE

Billy nods
After a moment Jasmine holds up a game of Twister
JASMINE (CONTD)
Look what I found in my things
