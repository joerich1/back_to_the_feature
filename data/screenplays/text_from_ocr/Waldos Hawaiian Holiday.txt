‘Repo Man’ team
ready for a new
‘comedy of dread’

By HOLLIS WALKER
The New Mexican

The creative team that produced the
1983 cult classic Repo Man — including
Santa Fean Jonathan Wacks — will
reunite to produce a second film Edge

City

Wacks chairman of the Moving
Image Arts Department at The College
of Santa Fe said he and partners Alex
Cox and Peter McCarthy are “a little
sharper our swords are more polished”
than when the three UCLA film school
graduates collaborated on Repo Man

Described by the Videohound Golden
Movie Retriever as “an inventive per-
versely witty portrait of sick modern
urbanity following the adventures of a
punk rocker taking a job as a car repos-
sessor in a barren city” Repo Man
starred emerging actor Emilio Estevez
as the punk named Otto and Harry
Dean Stanton as Bud his mentor in the

business

car repossession
Estevez is among the actors who

phoned Wacks after a recent blurb in
the trade publication Variety indicated

Please see REPO Page A-2

REPO

Continued from Page A-1

the trio was considering produc-
ing another film

Stanton also called as did
Vince DOnofrio Matt Dillon
Charlie Sheen and Robert
Downey Jr Wacks said

There could be parts for all of
them in Edge City Wacks said he
sent a script to Estevez and the
two have been playing “phone
tag” in recent days

Cox wrote and directed Repo
Man Wacks and McCarthy pro-
duced it Cox wrote the script for
Edge City and will direct it
Wacks said Cox also directed Sid
and Nancy Walker and last
year’s Highway Patrolman

McCarthy wrote and directed
Floundering He also wrote and
produced Tapeheads and pro-
duced I’m Gonna Git You Sucka

Wacks who took over the col-
lege’s film department last Sep-
tember previously was head of
production for Samuel Goldwyn
Co and served as president of In-
dependent Film Producers
Among his film projects was
1989’s Powwow Highway which
he directed

In February McCarthy and
Cox had traveled from their
homes in California to Santa Fe
to participate with Wacks in a fo-
rum on Repo Man for the col-
lege’s television program Ciné
Café At that meeting Cox pre-
sented Wacks and McCarthy for

a script for the new film The trio
had only discussed a second film
informally before Wacks said

He said Edge City will not be a
sequel to Repo Man but instead
will be “as related to the other
film as the Monty Python films
are related to each other A lot of
the same cast but different
characters different circum-
stances”

Wacks said the protagonist in
the Edge City script “thinks he’s
won a trip to Hawaii and he tries
to get out of Los Angeles but
can’t”

Asked how he would character-
ize its genre Wacks invented a
new one “Its a comedy of
dread” he said

Financing of the film has not
been arranged but some inves-
tors have made overtures Wacks

id

“We haven’t shown it to any-
body” he said “We first want to
put it together put the actors in
place put the budget together”

Financing of films now de-
pends almost entirely on which
actors are interested in being in
them he said

Wacks said they hope to pro-
duce the film this summer Part
of it could be shot in New Mex-
ico

“Im excited about it” Wacks
said “I think we have an oppor-
tunity a decade later to try to
figure out what has happened to
us and the culture and ‘Otto’”

A community of potholed streets and dilapidated ranchstyle
bungalows

on the tarmac

It slows to let SMILEY and JR pass heading with their
burden for a patch of waste ground with an OIL WELL

Nearby a STREET LIGHT flickers out

The car clatters away WALDO stands on the corner gazing
at the darkened house from which SMILEY and JR came

overgrown metal gate

Behind him on the far side of a roadside SHRINE to the

JR heaves the CORPSE into the newly-dug grave
He wears a tweed jacket and taped-together engineer boots

and rising OIL obscure BORISs features

vehicle by a friend of mine

SMILEY rises leads WALDO thru the French Windows into the
overgrown --

45 BACKYARD EXT NIGHT
-- where a large anonymous car is covered by a tarpaulin

SMILEY

a young COP your age in fact
who bought the car in compliance
with his POLICE DUTIES but then
sickened by the constant cynicism
and violence resigned from the force
and went on a QUEST for spiritual
enlightenment - a QUEST from which
he still has not returned

SMILEY removes the tarp revealing an UNMARKED BLACK POLICE CAR
with black hubs and directible SEARCHLIGHTS

WALDO
KOOL

SMILEY beams at WALDO running his hands ecstatically over
the car HIS POV - again the Tom of Finland WALDO

SMILEY
Be my guest

He hands WALDO the keys WALDO jumps in and cranks the
motor - the RADIO kicks in with the sound of GYPSY VIOLINS

TIGHT ON WALDO - his face dissolving into --

46 A VISION OF THE PLANET MARS

Rotating on its axis in the starry void the RED PLANET
magnificently displays its ancient mountains and rift
valleys its crimson dust storms and its snowy poles

The sound of GYPSY VIOLINS intensifies
VELMA VO

WALDO
No No its like I AM from Earth but

48 WALDOS DREAM OF LIFE ON MARS

He is in a big dome with a red volcano and an ice cap
outside He is seated in a BARCALOUNGER staring at a
BIG SCREEN TV A strangely-shaped PHONOGRAPH beside him

ON SCREEN an image of himself driving the car with VELMA
WALDO directs his CLONEs actions with the TV REMOTE CONTROL

He is attended by TWO MARTIAN MAIDENS - big-brained with
mulitfaceted eyes four arms and giant insectoid wings

They ply him with Martian grapes and French Champagne

A THIRD MARTIAN MAIDEN is giving him a BLOW JOB

with undisguised contempt WALDO becomes uncomfortable
WALDO

I didnt mean that Velma No in

MY WOMAN to pay close attention to her
personal finances A bounced check an
unpaid bill that shows up on MY record
impeding my ability to ACCESS CREDIT

WALDO
Who are those guys

VELMA
Theyre the Armani Boys Waldo
Community Police Officers who lost
their jobs when the Department was
downsized For a while they worked
as private security men - but the end
of affirmative action and poor timekeeping
drove them from the trade They still
thirst for justice though now in
a private capacity

WALDO

WALDO continues mumbling

SMILEY
Hows work going

SMILEYs polite enquiry opens the floodgates on a TORRENT
of WALDOIAN ANXIETY and job-related concerns

WALDO
I was rushing and I got this TICKET
I was only going like the proper limit
but I had to SPEED UP to overtake this
car that was traveling too slow And
so this COP gave me a SPEEDING TICKET
Well I had to get it FIXED so it wont
show up on my record cause I have to
have a clean driving record for my JOB
but when I went to the COURT they
wouldnt let me go to TRAFFIC SCHOOL
because you can only go if you were
going 19 miles or less over the limit
and this COP had written me up as
TWENTY MILES OVER

ANGLE ON SMILEY his benign features subtly glazing over
ANGLE ON WALDO wild-eyed warming to his theme

WALDO
So now I have to go to court again
and fight it but I cant tell them
why I need the day off work Do you
think I can maybe say Im involved in a
LAWSUIT Because I really dont want them
to know I have car problems Now my car
is only firing on THREE CYLINDERS and
my MECHANIC says I have to pour another
THOUSAND DOLLARS into it or get rid of
it fast Would it be right to sell it
to someone knowing its in BAD SHAPE

SMILEY absent-mindedly turns the stove burners on
The IRON PAN starts heating up WALDO turns them off

WALDO
(staring at the stove)

I heard they have these auctions -

the City has these auctions - and you

WALDO
You ever meet a guy called REGGIE CANTU

VELMA
No I dont think so

WALDO rises and takes the pipe from her He holds it under
his nose savoring the rich fresh fragrant tobacco

WALDO
Aha So you DO know him

RE WALDO

Dear Alex

Bad news Emilio Estevez has passed on the project

After reading the script again he feels the film isnt right
for him at this time in his career Mr Wacks Mr
Papsidera Mr Chubbuck and myself have tried all day to
find ways to get him back on board but to no avail All may
not go down the drain if we can tind a good alternative and
if Willem Dafoe remains committed to playing Smiley It
would also help our credibility with our backers if we
could land another bankable name in another role Sorry to
put a damper on the trip Just want you to start thinking
about Waldo replacements If you have anyone in mind fax
the names to me and Papsidera can start finding out about
their availability

Reminding you if you can please bring back my
“Eloundering trailer All my best to Negi
