CROWNING INFAMY

The Invasion of Johnson County and the events that
led up to it occurred exactly as depicted in this
narrative The real names of its victims are used
throughout as are those of its principal agents
Frank M Canton and Tom Smith

The instigators themselves appear under pseudonyms
put they are drawn from the life

The avenger is a fabrication the object of his

revenge a fact

In 1894 the first and only comprehensive account of
these events was published AS Mercers
The Banditti of the Plains or the Crowning Infamy

of the Ages Hardly had it appeared when a court
ordered the plates and all traceable copies to be
destroyed

Even the copy in the Library of Congress disappeared
- as by that time had all the vital witnesses

in the case

Alex Cox

The OPENING TIPLE fades in on a black screen

THE WINTER OF 1886 WAS THE WORST WYOMING

HAD EVER KNOWN LOSSES OF BICHTY
PERCEND WERE COMMON ON THE OVER-STOCKED
RANCE

THE LEAN YEARS THAT FOLLOWED DROVE

MANY SURVIVING RANCHERS INTO ORGANISATIONS
THAT WOULD PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS

AND INTO ORGANISED ACTS OF VIOLENCE

THE EVENTS THAT FOLLOW ARE TRUE

Behind the TITLE a distant babble of voices grows up louder
and increasingly distinct When one voice is audible above
the rest a flame sweeps the screen and we are in the city of

CHEYE NNE NIGHT A torchlit demonstration in the Main Street
Some thirty men are present while others watch from windows

and the boardwalke The crowd mingles and murmers around a
SPEAKER who addresses them from the back of a wagon

His whiskered face is livid in the fire glow

SPEAKER
«- For too long Beyond this county line
outside Cheyenne men who till now have called
themselves farmers or sooners are openly
engaged in rustling without pretense -

rejoicing in the name of mavericker

Their neighbors Their neighbors are for
the most part perfectly aware and not only
wink at but applaud their action

When the Company When a company hag
succeeded in bringing one of these offenders
to justice juries composed of homesteaders
have refused to inflict or convict them -

We probe the faces of the crowd Grim expressions are
everywhere though many strain to hear exactly what he says
Throughout his tirade run constant streams of supporting
invective constant but localised - from two or three
angry sources
SPEAKER ¢

- Or brought in verdicts of not guilty in

the face of overwhealming evidence of guilt

including that Ineluding eee

He must shout now for the anger has begun to infeet the crowd

SPEAKER
Of stock detectives from the city of Cheyenne
employed to protect this citys interests
Men whe have produced evidence as conclusive
Aes conelusive as any ever submitted to a court
of justice

At the edge of one pocket of voluble outrage stande FRANK M
CANTON - tall heavy-browed in clean anonymous cowboy gear
He has not spoken but now he shouts direetly at the SPEAKER

CANTON
What are we gonna do then
The SPEAKER whirls to answer arm outstretched and finger
ready pointing

SPEAKER
Do my friend What do you think the men of
Cheyenne will do when their livelihood is
threatened Their livelihood aye and their
honour - and the honour of our great State
There are only two horns to our dilemmas
either the thieves or the cattlemen
must pay the price

The whole gathering is shouting now its noise swelled by
shoute from the boardwalks its numbers by men hurrying into
the Street We see but can no longer hear the SPEAKER
In the thick of the excitement CANTON turns and looks away
from the crowd In a large upper storey window

a single figure stands

THE CHEYENNE CLUB NIGHT Deseribed in its charter as

a pleasure resort and place of amusement the Cheyenne Club
is a grafting of Eurepean affluence onto a moneyed but
uneultured West Chandeliers and fine glassware thick-framed
landscapes and extravagant dressings adern plain unpanelled
walls and bare ceilings

Sometime brothel gambling den and saloon ite many purposes
exist for us only in the background For the Cheyenne Club
is the headquarters of the Wyoming Board of Livestock Growers
and in a committee room facing the Street we find three

Board members

MAJOR GREAVES a former army officer from Kentucky paces the
floor His bearing is military his neck - strained years ago -
will not permit him to turn or raise his head

GREAVES
Mr Everett If you dont mind we still
have matters to discuss

WALTER EVERETT stands at the window holding the curtains
apart He dresses well and somberly like GREAVES he is
the manager of a large ranch and in addition a director of
the Cheyenne and Northern Railroad

EVERETT
(deliberately taking his time )
Going well Im sorry Major
You were saying

HEPPLER
The Major was talking about rastlers

EVERETT
So it seems is everyone

EVERETT and HEPPLER exchange smiles enjoying a private joke
JOHN HEPPLER is younger than the others put rapidly running to
fat — which his tightly-cut fashionable suit does nothing to

conceal

GREAVES s
When you gentlemen are ready to proceed

HEPPLER
Very well Ag we were about to discuss yeild
in any case I would like to raise the subject
of the poor returne on our northern stock

investments

GREAVES

(grunting)
Maverickers -

HEPPLER s
Maverickers and rustlers whatever you want
to call them are only part of the problem
Major Greaves The range in Ford County
has been plagued by insects A lot of our
grassland is over—grazed

GREAVES
What are you -

EVERETT
Youre right up to a point Heppler but
where does it get you In six months time

we are due for auditing and we have
steckholders reports to prepare before that
We cant -

HEPPLER
Which is precisely why we should be looking
for a serious solution to our problems and not -

GREAVES
Thats fine talk coming from a —

EVERETT
John if you find a solution let me know
Ive managed cattle enterprises in Wyoming for
fifteen years first on my own account and then
on behalf of Eastern investors like yourself
and I dont think there is a solution -
serious or otherwise

GREAVES
Youd see the solution soon enough if you
stepped into the saddle once in a while

Realising he is no longer a party to the discussion
GREAVES marches to an inlaid cabinet and pours himself
a drink

EVERETT
Theres no preventative medicine for a prairie
fire now way to stop a cow dying of the cold
And theres no cure for the plain bad management
thats crammed those ranges so full the grass11
never grow back

HEPPLER
All right I know But you cant go on
forever laying the blame on Acts of God and I
cant tell two hundred investors in New York
and Washington theyve been too greedy

GREAVES
(laughing harshly)
Id like to see that

EVERETT
fhats why John Thats the reason for
whats going on outside Rustlers are a menace
Homesteaders may not be our main problem but
they certainly dont make open-range ranching
any easier Maybe they arent whats wrong
put theyre our explanation when the accountings
due
Its the only explanation that isnt going to
be a slap in the face for us If the right
people can be convinced that Buffalo is Robbers
Roost - and theres truth enough in that -
the Board of Stock Growers stays solvent for

another year
HEPPLER
And what if -

EVERETT
A let can happen in a year
With good weather and better judgement -

HEPPLER
You know dont you that if the Buffalo
business is believed well have to take
action Well be under an obligation

GREAVES
(unable to resist a rejoinder)

Under an obligation You talk like a
woman Mr Heppler Everett here takes a
damned roundabout route to get at the plain
truth Any man thats a eattleman would
be honored -

He breaks off as there is a knock at the door

EVERETT

Come in

The deor opens and FRANK CANTON enters the room
He acknowledges EVERETT surveys the others with easy

CANTON
Mr Everett Partys going okay now

so I figured Id come up

EVERETT

indolence

Thats fine Frank Major Greaves you probably

know Frank Canton or of him
John Heppler Frank Canton

GREAVES nods curtly HEPPLER rises and extends a hand

EVERETT
Mr Cantons going to supply some of

your action John

JOHNSON COUNFY DAY An enormous expanse of prairie with
hills in the distance If the range is overstocked there
is little evidence — grazing cattle thinly speckle the land
Along a trail in the foreground marked by a row of
telegraph poles and a wire fence come two riders

JOHN TISDALE drives a buckboard loaded with supplies

He is middle-aged with a round weatherbeaten face under a
straw hat Turning he makes some remark to RANGER JONES
who rides a horse alongside JONES is younger and shares
TISDALEs tanned hard looks His jeans and boots are old
but the check shirt he wears has a fresh store-bought air
JONES wears a holstered revolver at his him TISDALE is

unarmed

The first shot catches TISDALE just below the throat
He jerks and gasps trying in vain to breathe
Then his grip on the reins slackens and he starts to slide

out of his seat

JONES stares astonished for a moment then hauls his horse
to a stop wheeling round and reaching for his gun

There is another shot and he winces as a bullet enters his
side craning wildly about looking for the source of the
shooting His horse stamps sideways caught between
wagon and fence JONESs gun is in his hand

A third shot and he falls from the saddle
Dust rises in a low cloud The horses separate and
plod on leaving théir riders dead on the trail

THE JONES HOUSE DAY A low wooden ranch in Johnson
County with corrals and half-completed outbuildings
Within JONES wife BRENDA her two young sons and JONES
cousin LEW are finishing a meal

BRE NDA
Some more ‘Theres plenty

Though she is in her early thirties she looks older

with hair swept severely back from wrinkled brow and eyes
When she rises to go to the stove it is still plein that
she has kept her figure

LEW
Not for me

LEW hag RANGERs look about him — fine dark features and

eyes that reveal little He starts to collect the plates

The boys take this as a signal to head for the door

BRE NDA ¢

You boys wait until youre told you can get up

They dodge noisily past her LEW makes a belated grab for
one of them BRENDA looks at him apologetically

BRE NDA
They only listen to their father

LEW helps her load the washbowl

LEW
Tough

BRENDA
Not when hes around But you know the Ranger
as well as I do Lew Some ways you know hin
better Hes always off somewhere - riding
the line checking fences going inte Buffalo
for supplies

LEW
Its a lot of work running a farm

BRE NDA
You think I dont know that Im the one spends
all her time here Ranger started building me
that turkey house a month ago and its still
only got two walls

LEW shrugs noncommitally and watches the boys play outside
BRENDA scrubs viciously at a pan

BRE NDA
I should have known better Youre the same
as he is Litting owt for California the

way you did -

LEW
I came back didnt I

BRE NDAs
Sure when the gold ran out
You wont stay long I wish
But you wont stay

LEW
Dont be too sure You say youve got too
much work And Rangers not going to manage
round-up by himself

BRE NDA
I know Youll stiek around for a while
all right because youre kin

LEW puts his hands on her shoulders in the manner of one
who is more than an in-law She stiffens

LEWs
Thats not the only reason Brenda —

BRENDA
Dont

She breaks away carrying some item needlessly to a shelf
LEW returns to the window and starts to roll a cigarette
The cries of the boys attract his attention

LEW
We got company coming

BRE NDAs
(indifferent)
Ranger
LEW

No theres more than one

BRE NDA
Thatll be John Tisdale He said he was
going to pick him up on the way into town
And theyll want to eat of course

She starts to lay the table again methodically

BRE NDA
I just get tired Lew I can cant I

LEW does not take his eyes from the window

LEW
Theres more than two of them

And theyre coming fast

BRENDA joins him The riders are close at hand four of
them thrashing lathered horses towards the ranch
LEW crosses to the door and takes his gunbelt down from a nail
BRE NDA ¢
(afraid)
Company men do you think
LEW does not reply
BRENDA

The boys lew

Quickly he opens the door JONES two sons are standing
gawping at the approaching men

LEWs
You kids -get in here fast

They turn and stare at him

LEW
On the double

Then they move but not towards the ranch Seooting sideways
they disappear behind a pile of lumber Small faeces peer
out through the gaps Before LEW can move the riders are
in the yard They halt abruptly beside a tie rail
dust-encrusted men on steaming ponies

Only one dismounts The others sit uncomfortably still and
silent Their leader walks towards the doorway where LEW

stands
LEW
No further mister

The man halts uncertainly squinting into the sunlight

BASCH
Mrs Jones at heme

LEW
Who wants to know

The stranger fumbles with his jacket pulling down the lapel
to reveal a dull copper star BRENDA steps inte the doorway

beside LEW
BASCH
Im Charles Basch I work for Sheriff Angus
in Buffalo

BRENDA

Come inside

BASCH comes out of the light and up the steps LEW makes
way for hin He stands awkwardly just inside the doer

BRENDA
Do your frien do the other gentlemen want
to come inside as well

BASCH
No we got to head on Another call to make
then back to town
Hell of a thing

BRENDA stares at his open vest at his badge
LEW loeks from her to BASCH and back again

BASCH
Your husbands shot Maam “Him and John Tisdale
Theyre dead

She nods slowly not moving her eyes

BRENDA
(no more than a breath)
Where

BASCH
On the road out of town
We took them back to Buffalo

LEW
Who did it

BASCH
Youre the Rangers cousin that right Lew

LEW
Who shot him

BASCH
Sheriffs arrested a Gattle Company detective
named Canton But theres a lot of Cheyenne
men in town

BASCH shifts his feet Neither LEW nor BRENDA seens to
notice he is there

BASCH
Id better go The sooner we get back
There may be trouble

He turns and walks out leaving the door open

BRE NDA
Thank you

LEW watches BRENDA who still has not moved BASCH rejoins
the other deputies and mounts up We hear the boys
voices again

BRE NDA ¢
Will you call the children in Lew

BUFFALO DAY In the main bar of the Clarion Saloon -

low and thick-walled the biggest building in Buffalo -

a crowded court is in session People sit in rows on ehairs
benches tables and along the bar as Justice of the Peace
PARMALEE addresses the assembly from his restrum

FRANK CANTON sits below him flanked by BASCH and another
deputy SHERIFF ANGUS barrel-chested with a thiek growth
of black beard stands nearby

LEW is among the spectators BRENDA is not

PARMALER ¢
In the past two days I have heard a variety of
testimonies from local citizens and from residents
of Cheyenne concerning the assassination ef Orley
E Jones ah familiarly known as Ranger Jones and
John Adams Tisdale both of Johnson County on the
Ucross Road I have also heard from several sources
evidence as to the whereabouts and ah expressed
intentions of Frank M Canton resident of Cheyenne
on the day of the murders

Conversation grows in the courtroom as PARMALEE proceeds

PARMALEE
The purpose of this preliminary hearing is to
establish whether there is sufficient grounds
for the accused Prank M Canton or any other
person or persons to be committed for trial by
the State of Wyoming I have studied the
depositions of Sheriff WE Angus and given
lengthy consideration to the other testimonies
heard It is my conclusion that the evidence
against Frank Canton would if submitted to a
regular court of justice be regarded as hearsay

and hence would be inadmissible A prosecution
would be unavoidably hampered by the absence of
witnesses to the crime itself

Angry noises are breaking out here and there while smiles
and the odd whoop erupt from the large Cheyenne faction
LEW watehes without a word ANGUS tries to pinpoint a
ringleader

PARMALEE
(ignoring the disturbance)
The case against Canton is simply not strong
enough to warrant his being brought to trial
and the Sheriffs Office

A SHOUT
How much they paying you Parmalee

PARMALEE
(hurrying to finish)
- the Sheriffs Office had better continue
its investigations Mr Canton you are free

to leave

PARMALEE sits back spent and darts nervous glances as
pandemonium breaks out around him Half the room rises

to its feet and a souad of Cheyenne cowboys surrounds
CANTON ANGUS wades into the fray shouting for order
BASCH wavers and then plunges after his boss

LEW sees CANTONs supporters hurry him out through a side
door Two men clear a path for PARMALER

Glass breaks nearby Men are fighting in a corner of the

Troon

BUFFALO DAY Late afternoon in the street a few hours
later Most of the buildings are crude and heavily—built
dark in the shadow of the hills

LEW comes out of the Livery Stable leading his horse
As he is saddling up SHERIFF ANGUS appears

ANGUS
Hello Lew

Sheriff
LEW goes on with his work ANGUS lights a cigar

ANGUS
I was worried for a while back there
Worried it would get to shooting Just as
well they got Canton out of town quick like
they did (disgustedly) Those boys
knew what they were doing

LEW puts his foot in the stirrup but ANGUS catches hold of

the reins

ANGUS
Youre going after him

LEW

(feigning faint surprise)

ANGUS

Dont be a liar Lew

LEW
Suppose I was Once hes out of Johnson
County whats it to you

ANGUS
Because I can see further than the county line
even if you cant The cattlemen in Cheyenne
are just waiting for something like that for
someone from Buffalo to take a pot shot at one
of their employees Itd be all the exeuse
they need

LEW
They dont seem to need exouses Angus
And Im not from Buffalo any more

LEW mounts but ANGUS tightens his grip The horse

whinnies nervously

ANGUS
Maybe youre not and maybe the town can go to
hell for all you care And maybe Judge

Parmalee was bought off - though more likely
he was just scared —- but what he said was true
fhere isnt enough evidence for 4 conviction

LEW
You think hes guilty

ANGUS
I did when I arrested him Hes a big talker
and a troublemaker — paid by the Stock Growers
to meke trouble for us But whether he
murdered them I dont know for sure

LEW
(not in the least convinced)
Maybe thats what Im going to find out

ANGUS takes a deep breath and lets go the reins

ANGUS
All right But you think about this
before you reckon up after the dead youve
live kin that needs consideration
Brenda Jones has lost her man and shes
two young sons and a farm to run
From what I hear you and her was pretty
close before she -

LEW
(eolaly)
You dont tell me how to take care

of my own

He turns the horse and sets it at a fast walk out of town

He does not look back but exchanges a long hostile glance
with a loafer who has been observing then The man is
small with a battered derby and incongruously trim moustache

His name is GILLESPIE

THE JONES HOUSE NIGHT LEW enters softly by the back
door BRENDA sits in a chair beside the lew-burning lamp

apparently asleep He takes off his coat and looks for
a place to hang it She stirs and opens her eyes
BRENDA

I waited up for you (starting to rise)
Can I get you anything

LEW

BRE NDA
Mrs Dawson came over and took the kids to
their place She wants me to stay there as well

LEW
You should have gone
Did you hear what happened in town

BRE NDA
They told me yes Thats why I waited
I wanted to see you before —

She breaks off her breast heaving suddenly on the verge
of breaking down

BRE NDA
Dont leave Lew I dont want to see
you killed Youre all -

LEW lifts her out of the chair and holds her
Tears flow but she does not make a sound

LEW
Ive got te know what happened Brenda
Im the only man that seems to care

BRE NDA
And when you know What then

He holds her tighter strokes her hair but her tears
do not stop

THE UPPER ROOM NIGHT An empty two-tier cot a small
dresser and a large brags bedstead are the only furniture
At first BRENDA seems to be alone sitting upright with the
moonlight spilling over her bare shoulders but when she
speaks we realise that LEW lies beside her

Each of them is still and separate as a pale statue

BRE NDA
I thought of you a lot after youd gone Lew
I thought about you so much it got to be like
a sin — the thinking of you and the wishing
Pa said I was well off that you wouldnt come
back or if you did you were still no good and
wouldnt marry me
And when Pa died and Ranger was so kind

He wasnt always like you saw him - running off
and finding work that took him away from home

I think it was having the children that turned

him against me Thats why we only had the two

I had five sisters and four brothers and eight

of them survived

He just didnt realise what it would mean I think

THE JONES HOUSE DAY At first light LEW emerges with his
belongings and saddles his horse in the corral Faintly we
here the sounds of early morning but BRENDAs monologue
continues voice-over as LEW prepares to leave

BRE NDA
Youre more alike than anyone allowed
People said Rangers feet was on the ground
that he wouldnt run off on any gold rush
But I think he was fooling himself or else
he let them fool hin He didnt really want
a farm and a family any more than you did

Is it wrong to wish it hadnt happened

fo wish I hadnt bourne his sons and didnt
have to carry on with what hes left behind
Its not right to be expected to be strong Lew

Will you come back when its done

LEWs
(voice-over also)
Of course I will

BRE NDA
(not believing)
It would be nice if you did

The empty windows of the house are the only witnesses
of LEWs departure

CHEYENNE NIGHT A wide street in an unsalubrious part
of town Saloens and dance halls east pools of yellow light
into the read Music and loud aggressive voices fill the
evening air and figures ride ren walk and stagger into and
out of the light

In one bar we find CANfON and his cronies listening avidly
to the story one of them is telling

JEBs
So this Sheriff sees us to the edge of town and
says “Now look here Canton I dont want to
see the likes of you in these here parts again
And Frank just stares him down - isnt that right
Frank - and says Sheriff the only thing thatd
bring me back to Buffalo would be you telling me
I couldnt come here no more

Guffaws and back-slapping from the company CANEON smiles
at the recent recollection As the laughter subsides —

CANTON
(with perfect timing)
You boys lost your appetites or are
you still drinking with me

More merriment as a round is ordered JEBs narrative
continues A young cowboy flashily dressed grabs
CANIONs arm

KID
We taught those nesters a lesson huh Frank

CANTON
Its gonna take more than one lesson
before they learn anything

ANOTHER
Damn right - and next time those rustling
sons-of-bitehes aint getting off half so
lightly

In the midst of vociferous agreement another voice is heard

SMITH
Still causing trouble Canton

CANEON peers through the throng and picks out a tall
neweomer wide-stetsoned swaying on impossibly highheeled
boots The pleasure that comes into the gummans eyes
is genuine

CANTON
fom Smith You big «

SMITH
Mind your language in front of these ladies Frank

TOM SMITH pushes forward and grasps CANFONs hand
A new babble breaks out at SMITH and CANTON embrace

MEN
fom Smith the Texan -
Why they say he
Whats he doin here

“THE CHEYENNE CLUB NIGHT The long table in the Stock
Growers boardroom bears the debris of dinner Several
black waiters are clearing the decks cigar boxes direulate

- GREAVES sits at the head of the table EVERETT a couple of
places down HEPPLER is near the far end The other
men we do not know

At a nod from GREAVES EVERETT calls a waiter over

EVERETT
Samuels you can finish clearing up later

SAMUELS nods and silently ushers the other waiters away
He closes the double doers behind hin GREAVES rises
dramatically locks them with a seterm fleurish

GREAVES
(addressing the board members )
Gentlemen

He waits for silenee studying their faces EVERETT begins
to spread papers on the table

GREAVES
It is important that we see this attempt to
brand one of our employees a murderer in its
wider context For several years now servants
of the Board in particular our cattle detectives -
have been subject to harraasment in the northern
reaches of the State It has never been a
seeret that the focal point of this campaign
of intimidation has been the rustler capital
at Buffalo This latest incident is another
in a series of attempts to discredit the Company
in the eyes of honest ranchers so as to
facilitate the crippling thefts we have been
forced to suffer

Grunts of agreement severe looks narrowed eyes

GREAVES
There can be no going back now gentlemen
The decision we took in January of this
year has been been more than justified by
these events

He motions to EVERETT to take over There is sporadic
clapping One of HEPPLERs neighbors interrupts

CATTLEMANs
A point of information Mr Chairman
I and certain other board members were not
present when the vote you refer to was taken
I wonder if Mr Everett could enlighten us
as to the source of his evidence
that such strong measures are required

EVERETT

(businesslike )
Aside from Mr Canton who as you know has been
forced at gunpoint out é6f Johnson County the
Company employs three full time agents in
Buffalo and a dozen in the County For their
own safety they are not officially kmown as
Company representatives and they operate
under aliases In addition of course there
are the friendly ranchers in and around the
County In overall charge of our staff is
Mr Gillespie of Pinkertons National Detective
Agency It is he who gathered the affidavits
warning of retaliatory rustling on a large
gseale and

GREAVES
I hope that answers your question

A file is

EVERETT
(anxious to convince)
other activity prejudicial to our
interests I shall be happy for you
to examine this summary dossier

passed down the table ignored by almost everyone

GREAVES
(impatiently)

The train
EVERETT

fwo nights ago our chartered train arrived
from Denver At present it is in the
Cheyenne and Northern switching yard behind
Grays Packing Warehouse fully leaded and
equiped There is no forseeable reason
why the cost ef the enterprise included the
salaries due to hired men from outside the
State andbounty money should exceed our
original estimate of one hundred thousand
dollars This includes a contingency

reserve of ten per -

GREAVES ¢
The train will leave tomorrow at noon
I shall be aboard as will Mr Everett
My Heppler and Dr Kinross
The responsiblility of command will rest
with me
We shall follow the northern line as far
as the spur at Caspar

Indicating their route on EVERETTs map GREAVES is prepared
and decisive - the general on the eve of battle

The private conversations which has dtarted while EVERETT
spoke soon die away

GREAVES
We shall not take the train into Johnson
County due to the risk of discovery

Instead we shall discharge our cargo
south of the County line where forty
mounts and a supply team will be waiting

CATTLEMA Ns
Theyre not all rustlers in Johnson
County then

GREAVES
We shall proceed on horseback through the
foothills of the Little Big Horn — an
inauspicious starting point perhaps but
from there Buffalo is only a days ride
along the back roads

A MAN
(uneasily to his neighbor)
If weve gone this far I guess we cant
turn back

CHEYENNE NIGHT Down one of the rowdy bustling streets
comes a dust¥ trail-worn rider He slows as he passes a
saloon peers through the bright windows and rides on

It is LEW

In the bar of the Paris House CANTON and his palls are
good and drunk The focus of their attention is a burly
trapper called MOUNTAIN SPRING DAN — dextrously exercising
a variant on the pea-and-shell game to the cost and
amusement of the cowboys

SHAD one of CANTONs associates bids for his turn

SHAD
Gimme a shot at that Dan you fox
I got the hang of it now

DAN
Surely

DAN extracts five dollars from a grubby pile and lays them
on the bar SHAD puts his money on top

DAN
Watch closely now

He discloses a hard dry pea and gives SHAD a long look at it
then replaces the cover and swivels all three identical shells
about on the polished bar surface distracting the others

attention with feints and garbled nonsense

DAN
Iggery Jiggery Pokery Dokery
Cow jumped over the moon
The farmers daughters took to the waters
And so the poor dog had none which one Shad

SHAD scowls accusingly Laughter wells up around then
He tries to focus on the shells reaches slowly for one

glanees slyly at DAN and snatches up another

There is nothing there

Hoots of derision and leud calls for whiskey Someone nudges
CANFON who has been silent on the sidelinessall this time
When CANTON steps forward the noise dies MOUNFAIN SPRING
DAN grins and puts five dollars on the bar CANTON takes

a ten dollar bill from his vest pocket and lays it over DANs
No longer smiling DAN sees CANTON five dollars but goes no
further

A MAN
He wont raise you Frank

DAN recovering his smile lifts one of the shells

And CANEON slams the hinged--bar-door down on DANs right hand
holding it tight will DAN screams The room is still
DANs face white and deadly At last CANTON nods almost
affectionately and raises the trap

As DAN extracts his bruised and throbbing fingers we see the
pea through the shattered shell

CANTON
That one

He picks up the twenty dollars and life flows back into the
room DAN moves off glowering and nursing his wound

CANON
Ill buy a drink

MOUNPAIN SPRING DAN is only a2 few feet away lumbering slowly
CANTON counts out bills to the barman

With a speed suggested in his earlier sleights DAN whirls around
facing CANTON in a crouch a thin throwingkmife already gleaming
in his hand

And now we know how drunk CANTON is because he is slow
and looks surprised

But help comes from another quarter from a young man snatching
a bottle from the bar and swinging it at DANs head

The bottle connects and DAN goes down struggling against the
mass of cowboys who descend on him pounding him and dragging
him away

For a moment CANTONs eyes meet those of his rescuer

a dusty young drifter just in from the trail He starts
to speak but is surrounded and swept away by his mates
in a flurry of back-slapping laughter

LEW stands isolated in the center of the room
the bottle still in his hand

CHEYENNE DAY LEW comes down the side-stairs of his
boarding-house into the bright busy street He takes the
boardwalk to the end of the block crosses the road — weaving
in between the horses and laden wagons - and passes a row

of storefronts under construction He ambles but is
alert At the end of the rew he pauses and strikes a match
Two shining silver rails cross the street before him

He lights his cigarette and looks up the tracks

CANEON
Hey Kid

The cigarette that slips through LEWs fingers is the only
indication that he has heard Slowly he turns and looks back

CANEON and a couple of pals — SHAD and JEB are coming along
the tracks from the opposite direction

CANTON
I was hoping Id run into you

LEW
(unsure how to take this)
Me too
CANTON

Whats your name Kid

LEW
Lew Lew Brevett

CANTON
Never heard of you You sure of that

LEW
Yeah

CANTON
Phatll do for now Im Frank Canton
TPhese are Shad and Jebediah
You walking our way

LEW shrugs and CANTON takes his arm leading him across the
street towards the trainyard

CANTON
I dont like being in anyones debt so I
wont thank you for last night If you
hadnt got that bastard somebody else would
Whatd you do it for

LEW
I dont know Wanted you in my debt I guess

SHAD laughs and CANTON does not seem displeased by LEWs reply

CANTON
What’1l it take to get me out
You got work Hmm You want work

LEW
Im not bothered

CANTON
Not bothered he says No wonder
the States in the state its in

SHAD
(ovt of the blue)
You got a headache Jeb I sure have

JEB
(darkly mocking)
Must have hit your head on something
while you was drunk

CANTON smiles then notices a smart figure beside a freight
car is waving him over Others railwaymen and cowboys
mill about the nearby tracks

CANTON
(darting a final word at LEW)

Stick around these guys Junior

And he is gone SHAD and JEB stroll on with LEW between
them SHAD scowls at his companion

3G

SHAD
“Hit my head Hewd you make
out then partner

SEB
You should have seen me

They find a rail fence and hoist themselves up on it

SHAD
Coming or going Lew Brevett

LEW
What kind of work is it

SHAD makes a dont-mess-with-me face and slaps his holster
JEB snorts

SHAD
This kind
(breaking into a smile as if the whole
thing is a great joke)
Legal though Were all getting
sworn in before we go

LEW
Where

SHAD jerks his thumb at the train Another freighter
is drawing up alongside it

SHAD
Wherever that takes ug

JEBs
Dont worry about that Frank Cantons
a straight shooter Tom Smith too
Not to mention me and Doc Holliday here

Across the stockyards the new arrival is attracting much
attention Several railroad men are running a ramp up
to the first of the wagons

LEW
Cantens coming then

JEB nods and SHAD produces tobaceo

SHAD
Pays five dollars a day Plus fifty
pucks for every -

He treils off as a dozen hands slide doors apart and the

ear disgorges ite contents - a crowd of rowdy gaudy cowboys
twenty or more armed to the teeth

SHAD
(almost in awe)
fom Smiths Texans They came after all

Suspicious and confused LEW joins his companions on the rail

CHEYENNE STOCKYARDS DAY In spite of MAJOR GREAVES
estimated time of departure the shadows are long across the
marshalling yard when the train begins to roll

A powerful loco and a Pullman coach bearing the Cheyenne and
Northern insignia have been hitched to the freight cars

The cattle pens are empty but in their immediate vicinity

a curious crowd has gathered Though the train leaves
without ceremony most of the spectators seem to know its

destination There is an occaional shout of encouragement

the odd waving hat HEPPLER is among those who watch it
go he is anonymous as possible in an old overceat and
tilted cap

GREAVES more the military man than ever in kakhi and puttees
draws EVERETT out onto the rear balcony of their coach
GREAVES rests his hands on the ballustrade and surveys the
erowds EVERET® clutches his briefcase to his chest and makes
some comment lost under the thunder of the train about

brass bands It would be lost on GREAVES in any case

The cowboys native Cheyenne and Texan imports throng the
doors of the freighters They wave and gesticulate at the
onlookers and the air of their being off on a lark is strong
There is no sign of LEW or CANTON but there are many faces
we cannot see or do not recognise

Smoke drifts across the rear of the train When it
disperses the yard is deserted and the crowd is breaking up

THE TRAIN NIGHT On board the social divisions of

Cheyenne have reestablished themselves EVERETT and DOCTOR

KINROSS an unhealthylooking Easterner with a sallow face

and sidewhiskers are ensconsed in the Pullman trying to read

The Texans have congregated in the first of the box cars and
erouch among crates or on the floor playing cards and swapping

stories The Cheyenne men are spread among the remaining

freighters and their activities are much the same

Only one man deliberately occupies all three camps and it is
GREAVES patroling the length of the train cavalry switch in
hand He issues terse instructions as he passes paying

particular attention to the men quartered with the livestock
in the last wagon

GREAVES
fake care not to alarm these horses

SHAD LEW and others are crouched upwind of the animals

SHAD
(saluting on his haunches)

Yes sir

PLAYER
Who was that

SECOND PLAYER
Roll the dice

SHAD
Your boss

PLAYER
I work for Frank Canton not General -

The heavy rumble of the wheels makes it difficult for LEW

to hear the rest of his sentence But the mention of
CANTONs name draws further into the circle

No more is said for a while The train tunnels on through
the night

THE TRACKSIDE NIGHT wo handheld kerosene lamps provide
illumination for a shadowy form clinging to the top of a
trackside telegraph pole His long duster is an encumbranee

and he hag decided he can climb no highest
Freeing a hand the man fumbles in a deep pocket and
produces pliers

A distant whistle blends with the wind

He applies his clippers to the first terminal working his
wrist back and forth The wind tugs at his coat

With a steel searing the wire snaps and recoils into the
night We hear it whip the ground fhe whistle comes
again closer now His partners peer anxiously up
faces bright in their lamplight

His pliers snap the other strand and it too curls off into

darknéss Immediately he pockets the tool and starts his
descent The chug of the train is audible

When he hits the earth we see the saboteurs face for the

first time He is small-featured his moustache incongruously
trim It ig the loafer from Buffalo GILLESPIE

MAN
Lets hope its then

Very close now but showing no lights the train whistles
a third time

GILLESPIE
Its them

He and a companion take the lanterns to the tracks
The other man steps back into the dark and we hear the
gound of horses

As he returns leading three mounts the others begin to signal
with the lamps Chinks of light are visible through cracks
and curtains above the rails The train slows and the
three men draw back to avoid a rush of steam from the locomotive

The train halts and MAJOR GREAVES appears at the door of the

Pullman EVERETT close behind him Other doors open
spilling their light and men peer out

EVERETT
This is Mr Gillespie from Chicago Major

The saboteur extends a hand and climbs onto the platform

GILLESPIE
Major Greaves a pleasure

GREAVES
Sir Get your men aboard and well be off

A lanternbearer addresses GILLESPIE

MAN
What about the horses Bob

GREAVES
There isnt time to load then
You will be given mounts at Casper

GILLESPIE
Turn tem loose Jack

Further down the train the cowboys are growing noisy
Some have climbed out of the wagons

VOICES
Are we there yet

We missed it — gotta turn the train around

GILLESPIEs man starts to unfasten the horses‘ bridles

GREAVES
(shouting down the line)
You men Get back inside immediately
Those doors are to be kept shut

TOM SMITH is one of many stretching his legs beside the
train He looks up at CANTON in the doorway

SMITH
I dont warm to your boss Frank

CANTON
You ever had one you liked

GREAVES watehes icily as the cowboys cavort LEW appears
at the door of the last wagon No one makes a move to
get aboard EVERETT ushers GILLESPIE into the coach

GREAVES s
Driver Proceed

The ENGINSERs face appears He looks at the men
beside the tracks

ENGINEER
What did you say

GREAVES
I said proceed

The ENGINEER vanishes and for a moment nothing happens
Then smoke and steam flood the trackside and the wheels
turn skid and find their purchase JACK flails at the
horses rumps and hurries for the coach steps Some of
the cowboys further away are lessquick to notice

SMITH is aboard at the start of the scramble and he and

At

CANTON help haul the stragglers aboard As the train gathers
speed SHAD is heaved inside the last car by the Cheyenne
cowboys

For a while the freed horses run after the train

THE TRAIN NIGHT in the last box car the men have bedded
down One swaying lamp burns low above them LEW watehes
the others sleeping or trying to sleep under blankets and
overcoats When he is sure no one is paying attention

he gets up and goes to the door

Most of the Texans have retired though some are still awake -
talking and drinking TOM SMITH is one of them deep in
conversation with FRANK CANPON

SMITH
I think something should be done Frank
Weve started off on the wrong foot — badly
wrong My boys have come a long way
and they didnt make the trip just to be
railed at and treated like a bunch of
privates You know what Im talking
about

CANTON
Of course I do But to him thats what
they are You and me probably get a
eouple of stripes
Hes still fighting the war Tom

SMITH
Hell most of my boys are too young
to remember a war If theyd wanted
te go for a soldier they could be off
killing Indians right now
It wont work this way Frank
Twenty-four hours from now we could
be risking our necks -—

CANEON
Not from what Ive seen of Johnson County

SMITH
But if we go into this thing we ought to
do it united not split apart by bad
feeling

He pauses waiting for an impetus from CANTON

CANTON
Ill talk to Everett Hes no rancher
but he is what youd call a diplomat
And a few other things besides
(rising) Dont go to sleep just yet

CANTON leaves the car SMITH lights a cigarette
The opposite door opens and LEW slips in

THE PULLMAN NIGHT Gas-lamps burn dimly as GREAVES
EVERETT and GILLESPIE talk tactics round a desk
KINROSS and GILLESPIEs men are hunched in armchairs
doing their best to sleep

EVERETT
Se how long would you say we have

GILLESPIE
One day easily possibly two or three
Their problem isnt fixing a break in
the wire its finding it The spot
we picked is more than a days ride from
Casper And thats assuming they start -

He looks up as CANTON entere the coach

CANTON
Mr Everett could I have a word

GREAVES
We are in conference Canton
Come back later please

CANTON waits unmoving by the door Detective JACK stirs
in his armchair and looks dully at him

CANTON
(deliberately)
I was speaking to Everett

GREAVES
Mr Everett is busy now and will be
for some time

CANPON stares at GREAVES the muscles in his neck tightening
He seems to be measuring the gap - a coach length - between
them Then he changes his mind and turns to go

GREAVES
I am not accustomed Canton to my employees
disobeying my instructions Nor to having
them intrude unannounced upon my private
conversations Perhaps you will bear that
in mind and convey it to your men

GREAVES is cold and matter of fact GILLESPIEs face betrays
nothing EVERETTs is visibly alarmed But CANTON does
not turn around Still facing the door he takes his hand
from his belt a nd lets it hand loose a few inches from hig
holster JACK watches through half-closed eyes and
slips his hand under the blankets

CANTON reaches for the doorknob and goes out momentarily
admitting wind and engine roar EVERETT rises as if to
follow him

GREAVES
Sit down
Go on with your report Mr Gillespie

THE TRAIN NIGHT As if from a distance we witness CAHEONs
return to TOM SMITHs wagon He storms in blindly swearing
and upsetting a stack of rifles But his words and the clatter
of metal on wood are lost beneath the noise of the train-and the
howling of the wind through the open door The Texans abandon
their talk and struggle out of sleep SMITH watches much
perturbed yet determined to let the storm blow itself out

LEW is discovering another unexpected facet of CANTONs character

amid another crowd of spectators
Gradually CANFONs rage abates and he stands limp and livid
swearing in a methodical monotone Now SMITH intervenes

closing the banging door

SMITH
Frank Frank Okay

CANTON
Therell be no more of that Tom I swear to God
Ill not be spoken to like that Not again

SMITH
(as if consoling the bereaved)
Dont let it get to you

CANTON
Why did I take it Tom Can you tell me why
I took it Id kill a man for lege

SMITH
You took it because Greaves is the boss
Because hes got his own secret service in
there and you couldnt match them all
Whatever

CANTON looks at him with contempt for himself and for
SMITHs justifications

SMITH
You took it because hes in charge Frank
Because we depend on him for our work and
our pay For now But Ill tell you this
If heltries that again with any of us Ill go
no further And I speak for those I brought
with me

JEBs VOICE
And for us Frank

LEW looks round startled JEB and a group of Cheyenne
cowboys fill the doorway behind him

The growing murmer of agreement is stilled by the appearance
of GILLESPIE at the far end of the car He wears his slicker
buttoned against the night air Ignoring the Texans
hostile eyes he approaches CANTON

GILLESPIE
(confidentially)
Everett says hell see you in the
baggage car in five minutes

CANION smiles the smile he gave the Trapper as he crushed
his hand

CANPON
Everettcan go to hell

After one look at GILLESPIE LEW ducks back into the Cheyenne
car He has recognised GILLESPIE and he is scared

CASPER MORNING It is still dark when the train pulle into
the Casper spur - two sidings a deserted shack and several
pens where a score of horses huddle together for warmth

Metis voices can be heard through the wagon sides

EVERETT appears on the balcony with a lantern GREAVES
follows him out They are heavily-dressed and their breath
erystalises on the air

EVERETT
(sotto voce)
Just watch it this morning

He jumps down and goes to talk to the ENGINEER

Double doors open and a ramp is lowered from one of the
ears Lamps are lit within GREAVES leaves the Pullman
and stalks towards the source of light

The disembarkation is under weigh Ammunition crates

and rations are leaded onto a light wagon provided by Company
sympathisers Several cowboys saddle sullen horses in the
corral LEW and his company have the thankless task of
extracting unwilling livestock from the warmth of the cattle
ear GREAVES superintends the work his cavalry baton
tucked into an armpit

The heavy clouds on the eastern horizon glow with a dull
light

Progress is not fast and GREAVES is unhappy Some trivial
thing most likely LEW and JEBs abortive attempt to
disembark two horses at the same time - sets him stamping off
in search of CANTON To this end he accosts one of the
cowboys unloading ammunition

GREAVES
Wheres your foreman Ca —

Suddenly he realises the man is smoking For a moment GREAVES
can only gape then he dashes the cigarette from the mans lips
and explodes

GREAVES
What the devil do you think youre
playing at Thats powder youre
carrying

The cowboy looks at GREAVES quizzical and bored puts down
his crate and sits on it He takes out his tobacco

GREAVES
Get back aboard the train and gather your
stuff Your engagement is terminated

The cowboy rolis his cigarette glances once at GREAVES
with old eyes in a young brown face and feels for his
matches All work around them has stopped

Daylight creeps across the sky

FRANK CANTON approaches the vertex sees MAJOR GREAVES

and increases his pace But TOM SMITH is there before him
Ignoring the military man SMITH parks himself lazily on the
damp ground beside the seated cowboy

COWBOY
Got‘a light Tom

SMITH
Sure thing

He proffers a match and addresses the others

SMITH
fake a break boys

Gru 1S
No Face Bo )

GREAVES
(ignoring him)
This is your last -

A MAN
Give it a rest General

GREAVES
What was that

SMITH
I think someones telling you to shut up

Stick in hand GREAVES makes as if to wade inte the crewd
Jeering starts and CANTON comes out to meet him but EVERETT
steps between them like a preacher

EVERETT
Stop it Stop it
Now someone tell me whats going on here

SMITH
Basically Mr Everett were not taking
any more orders from the Major

Shouts of agreement angry and amused GREAVES tries to
shout back what they do to deserters in the Army

EVERETT
(quick and vicious)
Major please be quiet
Dont make things any worse than you have

GREAVES is cenfounded Mocking cheers from the cowboys

EVERETT
Now Mr Smith You and Frank Canton are
under contract to this Company You agreed
to hire men to perform a job of work and
most of them have received cash advances
If you wont

During this speech GILLESPIE and the detectives have

begun to sift through the ranks of the cowboys seruptitiously
shoving and attempting to split them into smaller groups

They glance idly at the mens faces

SMITH
Well do the Companys trouble-shooting
all right No ones welshing on his deal
But well do it for the Company and not
for hin

LEW catches sight of GILLESPIEs derby bobbing between

the stetsons The detectives motives do not concern
him — he knows if GILLESPIE gets a look at him he is in
big trouble As the Pinkertons advance LEW slips to

the edge of the crowd

Smoke from the still-burning engine drifts low overhead

EVERETT
So youre prepared to go ahead and do
your job with someone other than the
Major in command

Several voices join in noisy assent as a violent clatter comes
from the cattle ear The horses still inside nervous at the

activity and then the sudden inattention are kicking against
the walls and have upset the ramp

CANTON
(instinctively in spite of himself)
Shad Take some men and calm those animals

SHAD and some others head for the cattle car LEW seizes
his chance to join them GILLESPIE reaches the edge
of the gathering

EVERETT
As a representative of the Board of Stock
Growers I would say that the work in hand
is too important to be jeapordized by
individual quarrels and differences

GREAVES is cold and uncomprehending and EVERETT takes care
not to look at hin GILLESPIE seents a change in the air
and turns back into the crowd

EVERETT
If you would care to nominate someone
you consider capable of leading the
expedition to Buffalo I am sure the
Company would abide by your decision

There is a healthy buzz among those who understand what
EVERETT has just said

A TEXAN
How about it Tom

Approving voices are heard but SMITH looks dubious
He nods to CANTON

SMITH
I can help out sure But I dont know
the lie of the land Frank Canton does

MAJOR GREAVES pushes out of the company and walks alone and
rigid towards the Pullman CANTON steps into his place
He radiates the same cool control as he did when managing
the demonstration in Cheyenne

A MAN
What do you say Frank

We do not wait to hear what CANTON says but LEW and the
rest mud-splattered and struggling with the fallen ramp

hear cheers rising from the crowd

LEW
What do you thinks going on

SHAD
Something the General wont like
thats for certain

THE PULLMAN DAY ‘MAJOR GREAVES stands at his desk
packing a saddlebag A slim pocketbook a journal bound
in black leather a much-used gazeteer He pauses over

one item weighs it in his hand It is a framed oval
photograph aged and yellow of a woman and a little girl

EVYBRETE comes in and hovers at the far end of the carriage

EVERETT
Major — about what happened out there

GREAVES
(putting the photograph awey)
We have nothing to discuss Mr Everett

He continues to pack in silence

EVERETT
The mission is what counts Major
We cant risk -

GREAVES buckles the flaps on the bag EVERETT frowns

EVERETT
Youre leaving

GREAVES turns at this unconcerned about containing his
anger

GREAVES
Is that what you think
No Mr Everett Im not leaving
I am part of this enterprise even if
it is commanded by a criminal
I would ride to Buffalo even if you were
in charge

EVERETT
Unless we compromise well never —

GREAVES
Dont give me any of that Compromise didnt
make me what I am though I ean well believe
it mothered you What I am has cost me a lot
and I may still make mistakes But none of them

is as serious as the mistake you made
What you did will buy you time but its
sown a seed which could destroy this
mission And the Company with it

EVERETT
Major dont be absurd
IT cant talk to you when youre like -

GREAVES s
Then dont try

JOHNSON COUNTY DAY It is now fully light but rain-laden
elouds crowd across the sky Towards us at a sluggish
pace ride fifty men or more — and for the first time we see
the full strength of the party Most are mounted

the delay is caused by the flimsy wagon which carries not
only supplies but five men who have not found horses

Hooves drag in the wet turf and the mules that pull the

wagon are loath to move at the same speed as the other animals

At the head of the column rides CANTON with EVERETT at his
side Some distance behind come GREAVES GILLESPIE and
DOCTOR KINROSS shunned by the other riders The Texans
travel together bunched around TOM SMITH To a man

they dress less warmly than the Wyoming cowboys though none
will admit to feeling the cold LEW rides apart hunched
under a short overcoat and low-drawn hat JACK rides up
and down the line

JEB comes alongside LEW

JEB
Got any drinkables Lew

LEW shakes his head Watching CANPON up front trying at
the same time to keep a constant inconspicuous distawe from
GILLESPIE LEW has quite enough on his mind already

JEBs
Hmm What about you Shad

SHAD
Not me

SHAD produces a flask takes a swig and puts it away
JEB crosses the ranks after him

Detective JACK reaches the front of the plodding procession
and slips in between CANTON and EVERETT

JACK
Hows our time Mr Canton

CANPON
(not looking round)
The Major keeps looking at his
watch Ask him

JACK rides off without a word EVERETT studies CANTON
before he speaks

EVERETT
You might unbend a little Frank
The detectives are our employees too

Were all on the same side

CANTON
Those birds arent on my side
Mr Everett I took the rap for -

The approach of a rider ahead permits EVERETT to change
the jubject

EVERETT
Whats this Is he with us

CANTON
Outrider One of Toms men

CANTON raises an arm to halt the company as the outrider
gallops toward then TOM SMITH joins CANFON GREAVES
and GILLESPIE stop within earshot

SMITH
Somethings put a sting in his tail
(shouting) What is it Fred

The man reins up and dismounts before them his horse paces
about its flanks steaming

RIDER
Two men on horseback Tom — Mr Canton
Maybe five miles up the trail heading this way

CANTON
Armed

RIDER
Rifles In no great hurry though

CANEON reflects All eyes are upon him for this is the
first test of his leadership

SMITH
Did they see you

RIDER
I dont reckon so

CANFON
How much cover is there between them and us

RIDER
Some timber Couple of bluffs

CANTON
Could we get close enough to pick ‘em off

Before he can reply GREAVES interrupts angrily spurring his
horse into their little circle

GREAVES
What the devil are you suggesting Canton
That we assassinate these men not
knowing who they are

CANTON
(with emphasis )
It wouldnt be the first time its happened

LEW rides in as close as he dares dividing his attention
between CANTON and GILLESPIE He listens keenly

GREAVES
Not with my knowledge sir And
certainly not with my connivance

CANTON
You want us to reach Buffale unannounced

or not And what the hell are we here

for anyway

GREAVES
Our task Canton is to restore order to
Johnson County not to engage in
indiscriminate acta of violence -

CANTON
Oh sure

EVERETT
Please I think I think the Major is
justified I dont believe we can open

fire on men we dont know are rustlers

CANTON
I thought everybody here was a rustler
in your book

EVERETT tenses and stares at him impotent and appealing
A curious impatient crowd has formed and other voices
are heard

A MANs
We better make some kind of move

EVERETT
Reaching Buffalo has still got to be our
priority -

RIDER

What do you say Tom

TOM SMITH decides he has given CANTON long enough

SMITH
Lets just go around them Take a
different route and stay off the
trail till nightfall

Shouts of agreement are several as are principled objections

GREAVES
Impossible That would be reneging
on our

SHAD

Lets get ‘em Frank

EVERETT
How late would that make us
Were already behind time —

But CANFON takes TOM SMITHs way out

CANTON
Back on the wagon boys Were gonna
head east for a spell

The riders remount with the inevitable questions and complaints
GREAVES glowers and EVERETT seems only half—happy with this

particular compromise

SHAD
We coulda stopped them at least

CANTON
Youll get your action soon enough
Lew ride on ahead this time keep your eyes open

LEW sets off ahead of them jarringly involved
Ags the rest begin to move EVERETT seeks out SMITH

among the Texans

EVERETT
I dont want to sound like an old woman

- but these delays worry me a lot

SMITE
Frank will find the best route he can
If its secrecy you want youll have to
aceept delays

IRVINE
(closer and in lower tones)
Tom youre an intelligent man
Do you consider that we made the right
decision back at the train

SMITH
(thinking before speaking)
Yes I do But if Franks to make a
go of leading this party youll have to
give him his head Hes no committee
member and hes wrong trying to be

EVERETT
Thank you

A boistrous outburst oceurs nearby CANTON looks round in
the saddle
CANTON
fless noise back there

The procession plods on A light drizzle begins to fall

JOHNSON COUNTY NIGHT The party is camped in a shallow
gully the horses tethered by a spring Fires are
forbidden but the waning moonlight illuminates the range

Men lie under dark bedrolls their sleep at last undisturbed

We hear an owl hoot and it could be a real one — it is

answered by another unconvincing and close at hand

There is a gentle scrape of feet against a rocky slope

the clatter of dislodged pebbles GILLESPIE comes into

view leading another man in a long slicker and narrow-—brimmed
hat it could almost be his double

CANTON is waiting for them at the stream They talk in

whispers
GILLESPIE
Mr Canton this is Ted Highland foreman for the
TA spread Hes done some work for me in the
past
HIGHLAND

I was told to speak to Major Greaves

CANTON
Im in charge now Whats your news

HIGHLAND gets the okay from GILLESPIE before he speaks

HIGHLAND
Well

Three days ago some of my men was out looking
for strays east of the Powder River when they
saw smoke where they didnt expect it

The only settlement out that wayg the old KC
Ranch thats been deserted since spring of
lets see 87 When they told me I lit on
out there to take a look It might just be

trappers I thought but we been losing
more stock than we ought So I lit out
like I say and was I right te do so
There was no smoke this time but there was
sure as dammit cattle in the pens

I set there a while -

CANTON
(quiet and urgent)
Could you see the brands

HIGHLAND
Sure could Some was unbranded mavericks
But there was two I recognised - Cirele H
and the TA

CANON
They couldnt have bought them

HIGHLAND
Nobodys selling steers this time of year
And listen to this As I was coming away I
did meet two trappers that had stayed the
night at the ranch and they told me that the
men inside was Nick Ray and Nate Champion

This does not impress CANTON as much as HIGHLAND would like

HIGHLAND
Nate Champion — that was run out of
Buffalo last fall

CANTON

Hes got a record

GILLESPIE
Several counts nothing we could
make stick (significantly) Heg one
of the names on Major Greaves list

CANTON
(suddenly suspicious)
How come you knew to find us

HIGHLAND
The TA is a Company ranch My boss
put up a thousand dollars te finance you

GILLESPIE
I can vouch for this man Canton
The KCs only fifteen miles northwest
We could be there before dawn

CANTON looks about him weighing his options

HIGHLAND
Well

CANTON
Wake the men

THE RAVINE SUNRISE The KC Ranch is a T-shaped cabin
of interlocking logs on the floor of a deep ravine with
heavily wooded sides Phe morning is cold and clear

and bright sunlight has already clipped the western rim as

CANTONs men go for position among the trees

CANTON
Where the hell is Highland

He stares furiously into the cleft On the far side

we glimpse men moving among the trees GILLESPIE and
HIGHLAND come up the narrow path after CANTON

He directs their attention to the eorrals between Ranch
and river It is their first unobstructed view of then

and they are empty

HIGHLAND
As Im a Christian there was cattle
in there yesterday Fourteen head

HIGHLAND chews his lip unhappily JEB a few trees along
and lewer down the slope attracts CANTONs attention

JEBs
Frank - I think theres horses
in the lean-to

GILLESPIE
Then theres somebody there at least

CANTON
I dont want to hear another
word from either of you

Lewer still behind a rough bank of earth LEW and SHAD are
loading rifles

SHAD
Seen anything move

LEW
Not yet

SHAD
I tell you Lew - soon as that door opens
Im agonna let fly Aint gonna risk any
of the crap we had yesterday Soon as she
opens EeeeePow

LEW takes aim at the front door lowers his sights and looks
around in desperation With CANTON nowhere in sight the
attack on Johnson County about to begin LEW crouches with
an unbroken sightline to the Ranch and no way out

Smoke starts to drift from the cabins thick chimney
On the opposite slope the Texans see it too

SMITH
Wont be long now

From the top of the ravine MAJOR GREAVES watches through
field-glasses taking stock of the seige positions the

lie of the land Thirty feet below him EVERETT starts
a quick conference with CANTON We come in at the tail end

EVERETT
I dont know this man Highland any better
than you do Hes one of Gillespies contacts

CANTON
(eyes on the Ranch)
So what

et

EVERET®
So I think we play this carefully
If Highlands right fine If hes not
if there are ten or fifteen men in there
just suppose then were in trouble
A dozen men could stand us off for -

CANTON
Is that you or the Major talking

EVERETT
(embarrassed )
Frank does it matter When Greaves talks
tactics Im prepared to listen The one thing
that mustnt happen is for us to get locked into
a confrontation that loses us another day

Once again CANION wrestles with himself and comes off the loser

CANPON
Well give them a chance
Pete pass the word along No shooting

SHAD grimaces when the message reaches him
For a moment LEW relaxes

The back door of the cabin opens inward

SMITH sees CANTON signalling with his hands

SMITH
Not yet boys Lets see what
theyre up to first

A short heavilybearded man in furs comes out into the
ravine carrying a bucket He meanders past the
corrals and down towards the creek

CANFON motions the nearest sharpshooters to follow him
Laying down their rifles they parallel his path through
the trees

The bearded man reahes the water kneels and begins to wash
His hat falle off dislodging a shock of shaggy grey-streaked

hair He wrings it out and puts it back in place
He fills the bucket When he looks up two armed men
are facing him across the stream One of them puts his

finger to his lips

THE RAVINE MORNING The old timer is telling his story
to CANPFON and EVERETT Guns are still trained on the cabin

TRAPPER
Honest Misters Champeens in the ranch
all right And bis pard Ray But me
and my wife didnt know they was desperadoes
Why you dont think wed sleep under the same
roof as hoss thieves do you

HIGHLAND
Cattle rustlers

TRAPPER
Cattle rustlers thats what I say Honest
her and mes just on our way to start a
silver fox farm and we run into these young
outlaws by a freak of -

CAMON
What happened to the stock theyhad

TRAPPER
Took ‘em away Musta sold ‘em

Day ago or more

HIGHLAND
(to any who will listen)
See Like I said

TRAPPER
Listen Misters afore you git to shooting
will you let the missus out of there
She aint no mavericker

CANTON
I dont see how wed go about it

GREAVES comes down the path their feet have beaten and
instantly the air freezes over

GREAVES
We shall simply give them five minutes
to allow the woman to leave and throw

out their arms

TRAPPER
(alarmed )
Oh I wouldn do that No no wouldn do that

GREAVES
Surely they wouldnt shoot a woman

TRAPPER
Mebbe not but Champeen wouldnt let her
out neither And then one of your gang
might shoot her by chance in the fury o
battle You let me go down the crick
and Ill git her loose

GREAVES shakes his head so CANFON lets him go
All wateh as the little man threads his way back to

the stream

GREAVES
That was a bad move Canton They must
know somethings up by now

At the creek the TRAPPER rattles his bucket and stamps
up the track to the Ranch calling out

PRAPPER
Hey Hey Look see what I got

Shrill and disttant through the layers of legs a womans
voice can be heard Her words echo off the ravine walls

WIFE
Where you been you idiot

The TRAPPER halts by a clump of bushes

TRAPPER
Pertelote Come an see what I Retched

WIFE
You didnt ketch nothing

The watehers watch bered tense fascinated

SHAD
Soon as that door opens Eeee-Pow

GREAVES
Canton this is a mockery

A TEXAN
Reckon shes a looker Tom

WIFE
Nate says there aint nothing to keteh

And all is deadly still
The TRAPPER puts down the bucket and rubs his arm

TRAPPER ¢
(pathetically)
I cant carry it no further dear

For a long moment nothing in the whole canyon seems to move
Life only returns with the opening of the door

Onto the path steps a tiny woman clad identically to her
husband One of the cowboys has to suppress a laugh

She starts to walk towards her husband

On her sixth step a tall man bursts out behind her
brandishing two six-guns sprinting for the lean-to
And the trees burst into flashes of flame and thunder

rolls across the canyon

The woman drops and the TRAPPER disappears The tall man
fires one shot and he drops too jerking as he falls as
another bullet hits him and another

Shots pepper the wall above his head as he rolls onto his
side and fires indiscriminately at the trees
He is hit again

CANFON has to call several times for a cease-fire

As the echoes of gunfire die away slow movement returns

to the canyon floor

The old woman raises her head and begins to crawl on all fours
to the bushes where the TRAPPER beckons her

The tall man his guns empty starts te drag himself back
towards the cabin door

SHAD and LEW follow him with their rifles SHADs smokes
in the erisp air LEWs has not fired a shot

CANTON
Hold your fire

At the moment the FRAPPERs wife reaches the shrubbery
another figure fills the doorway Breader and a head
shorter than the wounded man he brandishes a leng-barreled
colt and has another stuffed into his belt

As the fusilade erupts again we hear HIGHLANDs exonerated cry

HIGHLAND
Its Champion

Bullets gouge the earth around him as NATE CHAMPION strides
sure-fdeted to where NICK RAY lies wounded He fires back
occasionally and with precision casting away his pistol
when it is spent and dragging RAY back by the shoulders to
the Raneh The TRAPPERS watch breathlessly as CHAMPION
passes within feet of them and heaves his friend indoors

The door slams CANEON calls another halt

VOICES
Anybedy hit him
I hit one of them
Maybe
Think I saw him £411

Fhe claims fade away

THE RAVINE AFTER NOON Some hours have passed and the
whole of the Texans slope is now sunlit Random rifle
shots crack across the ravine

CANTON and EVERETT are in conference and MAJOR GREAVES has
been allowed a say

EVERETT
I had no idea it could last this long
I thoughta morning at the outside
Do you think theyre both alive

CANDON
(listening to the gunfire)
Only one of thems shooting
I think we ought to cut our losses

EVERETT
Meaning what

CANEON
Leave now and ride for Buffalo You say
yourself we cant go on wasting time
like this

GREAVES
Nor can we leave our job half done
Hostile territory cannot be left

unconquered

CANTON
We can spare some men to keep him
pinned down

GREAVES
With respect Mr Canton we cannot
We shall need every man we have when we ride
on Buffalo We have wasted time and resources
here we cannot afford to split our most
valuable resource our men

CANTON
Thats fine talk coming from the feller
who was going to sack the lot of us not so

EVERETT
(intervening quickly)
Whats your solution Major

GREAVES
To burn them out

CANTON
Youre crazy Theyll see the smoke
for twenty miles

GREAVES
No great distance By the time anyone
gets here we shall be gone

The argument continues

Behind their earthwork LEW and SHAD await developments
SHAD takes desultory aim and squeezes the trigger
Phe bullet whines away in the general direction of the ranch

SHAD
Goddangit Why dont you come out again
How many you killed to date Jebediah

JEBS VOICE
(drifting through the trees)

Twenty-seven

SHAD
Pretty good for one afternoon
(to LEW more serious) Is your gun still
jammed

Yeah

SHAD
Want me to take a leok at it

LEW
Whats the use
(offhandedly) You were telling me about Canton

CHAD
Not much more to tell
Whered I leave off

LEW
puffalo

SHAD
Yes right Well we got the word
Frank was in trouble with the law
so we took the train a bunch of us
and Jeb and me — to Buffalo and sat
the trial out That was quite something

LEW
When did you get the word

SHAD
Christ I dont know (joking)
Champions sneaking out the back Jeb

JEBS VOICE
I got him covered Asshole

LEW
I mean before or after he was arrested

SHAD
Huh Why after I guess How could
we get it before

LEW
(ultra-casual)
Did he do it

SHAD
Kill those guys Franks not the -
New what do you make of that

SHAD stares across the canyon and LEW does likewise

Along the far rim black against the western sky comes

a tiny beeckboard drawn by two ponies LEW squints across
the distance a plan forming behind his eyes

He raises his rifle

SHAD s
Not a chance at this distance Lew

Unheeding LEW opens fire across the chasm pumping a withering
stream of near misses at the wagon

His shots tear up the path ahead of the ponies and the driver
swerves It is some of the most accurate shooting we have

seen all day SHAD doesnt follow LEWs reasoning but a fight
is a fight and delightYedly he too pours wild lead across

the canyon

Below the buckboard unaware of its presenee the Texans
make for cover
A TEXAN
Tom - theyre shooting at us

The tiny target has almost vanished and GREAVES is hopping mad

GREAVES
Cease fire Who fired at that wagon
Cease fire I said Gillespie do something
useful — get down there and stop that shooting

GILLESPIE leeks about him for someone to delegate to finds
nobody and hurries down the steep path - to escape from
GREAVESif nothing else GREAVES voice echoes after hin

GREAVES
(roaring at the Texans)
Get up there After them

CANTON
(through the trees)
Do it Tom Wagon on the rim

GILLESPIE picks his way among the branches
And LEW unable to see the buckboard any more leaves his
post in search of a new vantage point

SHAD
Where you off Lew

LEW
Higher ground

SHAD
Its not worth Lew

But LEW is gone heading up the path

SHAD picks out a couple of the Texans moving up the opposite

bank Most of the shooting across the valley has stopped
No sound comes from the Ranch

JEBS VOICE
I suppose you got him right

SHAD
Damned to hell right Annie Oakley

LEW hurries through the trees up the narrow slippery path
- looking for a break in the branches As the shots
across the valley peter out he hears the sound of someone
coming down the slope He freezes and moments later

and man appears stumbling and sliding towards him
GILLESPIE Winchester under his arm city man slipping much
too fast down the slimy embankment

In a single action LEW raises his rifle and fires
But at the same instant his oncoming target trips and falls
headlong landing on hands and knees

LEWe first shot echoes away The leaves rustle around them
Uncomprehending and frightened still on his knees GILLESPIE
raises his hands His rifle is a mile away

GILLESPIE
Dont

The dead cartridge ejeets with a clickeclack and the rifle
bucks again in LEWs hands fhe sound of the shot surrounds
then

GILLESPIE falls back off the path and rolls away into shadow

Green calm descends around LEW and his smoking rifle shaking
slightly Far off another gun is fired

The first Texan to reach the rim falls also -cut down by
CHAMPION

TOM SMITHs voice echoes angry over the ravine

SMITH
Frank

MAJOR GREAVES stands over CANTON who still watehes the Ranch

GREAVES
If the driver of that buckboard was not
killed by a stray bullet hell be on
his way to Buffale by now
What are your orders Mr Canton

CANTON
(bitterly)
Burn him out

THE RAVINE LATE AFTERNOON The western slope is in darkness
the sun low in the sky beyond A swirling funnel of gray
smoke fills the canyon Loose bundles of burning brush and
timber have been rolled down under the cabins eaves

by now the ranch is well ablaze

CANTON and the others watch through the smoke

EVERETT ¢
It shouldnt be long now

MAJOR GREAVES draws his fellew businessman to one side
GREAVES
Take some men and be ready to bring up

the horses I want to move the moment
were finished here

EVERETT looks as if this wont betan easy job

GREAVES
(with a half-smile)
fell them Canton sent you

LEW is back behind the bank with SHAD

SHAD
(anticipating CHAMPIONs exit)
Eeee Pow Eeee — Pow

LEW watches the flames spread across the roof

The Texans watch too - steny-faced and silent at the
less of one of their own It is the first casualty
the invaders have knowingly suffered

We hear other voices

MEN
Aint he never coming out
I reckon the cusa has shot himself

The front door flies open and smoke billows out
A seore of safety-catches click as one
The men wait guns trained on the doorway

NATE CHAMPION leaps through a rear window hits the ground
amid smoke and broken glass and is up and running

Shots land nowhere near him
He makes for the timber covering the ground fast

But now the marksmen have his range and bullets land
around his feet He stumbles lurches on with shoulders
hunched like a football player

He has almost reached the weods when he realises there are

Texans there too

A burst of fire at close range stops him in his tracks
and he tugs at the gun in his belt

Another burst tips him over

Bullets hit him where he lies

It is a long time before the shooting stops

Slowly men gather around the body cautiously at first
for fear that NICK RAY is still around somewhere
then more openly Their voices too are eautious

MEN
So thats hin
He leoked taller
His pals burned you figure
Bleds ite death more likely

CANFON appears GREAVES at his side DR KENROSS out of cover

for the first time accompanies then
CANTON tips his hat to TOM SMITH

CANTON
Hows your man Tom

SMITH shakes his head and looks for the makings

SMITH
I was sorry to lose him

GREAVES indicates CHAMPIONs bedy to KINROSS who seems irritated

at being dragged down into the ravine

KINROSS
Yes Major hes definitely dead

GREAVES
I want a report on the circumstances
I want it official Lets move the

rest of you

A TEXAN
We got a man dead too

GREAVES
(softly)
I regret that
One report on both Doctor
See that its witnessed

KINROSS bends stiffly to feel for a pulse Others
morbidly curious crouch alongside him

KINROSS
Get away please

COWBOY
Just looking Doc
What dyou reckon he died of

Part of the cabin collapses sending up a shower of sparks
and increasing the flow of smoke Several men attempt to
salvage livestock from the lean-to but are driven back by
the heat No one considers extinguishing the fire as a
whole EVERET JACK and the others arrive with the horses

GREAVES)
Fast as you can now Weve
still three ours of daylight

Some of the cowboys mostly Texans make for their animals
Others wait for an order from CANFON The latter throws
away his cigarette and with his eyes fixed on GREAVES

prepares to speak

JEBs
(rising by CHAMPIONs body)
Boys Git an earful of this

KINROSS
Give me that

DOCTOR KINROSS makes a grab for the small notebook JEB brandishes
JEB parries and beckons SHAD and the rest over

JEB
No sir This is good reading

SHAD
What you got there

JEB
Champions diary Listen

He rummages through the pages till the writing stops
There is blood on the book

JEB

(reading)
April ninth It is now about two hours since

the first shet Nick is still alive
They are still shooting and all around
the house

SHAD
He wrote that today I dont believe you

JEB
See for yourself

SHAD
If I could read I damn well would

JEB
(thoroughly immersed)

Boys there is bullets coming in like hail
Them fellows is in such shape I cant get
at then Nick is dead He died about
nine oclock It is now about noon

I dont think they intend to let me
to let me get away this time

A man approaches CANTON as JEBs account continues

MAN
Gillespies dead Frank
I think you ought to take a look

JEBs
I dont know what they have done with them
two that staid here last night
Boys I feel pretty lonesome just now

Unwillingly CANTON walks away - past the waiting horses

GREAVES looks briefly back at CANION then joins the Texans
who are saddling up He engages two of them in conversation

JEB
It is about three oclock now
There was 2 man in a buckboard just passed
They fired on him as he went by
They are coming back Ive got to look out

SMITH is with the horses now CANTON is nowhere to be seen

JEB
They are shelling the house like hail
I heard them splitting wood I guess they
are going to fire the house I will make
a break when night comes if alive
Shooting again Its not night yet
The house is all fired
Goodbye boys if I never see you again

Nathan D Champion

GREAVES and the Texans are mounted The Wyoming contingent
breaks up the men drifting away from JEB and the DOCTOR
GREAVES starts to turn his horse others do likewise
CANON rejoins the group

CANTON
(belatedly and he knows it)
Lets go

His men hurry to find horses CANEON mounts up and sets off
after SMITH DOCTOR KINROSS sees he has lost hig pony

KINROSS
Will someone give me a ride back to the wagon

They leave the Ranch a shell still burning
Someone has pinned a card to CHAMPIONs breast It reads

Cattle Thieves Beware

JOHNSON COUNTY NIGHT The sun has gone but the western
sky still glows Tonight no moon will shine
The caravan more spread out than ever crawls to a halt

CANTON
Well take fifteen minutes to let
stragglers catch up

The message is bourne back along the line
CANTON climbs down and stretches

MAN
We gonna light fires tonight Frank

CANTON
I dont see how we can so clese to Buffalo

MAN

(grumbling)
Were not that close

GREAVES JACK and EVERETT gather nearby They do not dismount

GREAVES
(evenly)
How close Mr Canton

CANTON ignores the question and asks one of this own

CANTON
Whog seen Tom Smith

SMITH
Here Frank

SMITH rides out of the gloom and gets down beside him

CANTON
Will you take a walk with me
Id like a word

They step out of earshot onto the range

CANTON
Tom Im worried

SMITH
Youre kidding What worries
you in particular

CANTON
Its not the fight I can handle that
Its the Major I think hes going
to try and take charge again

SMITH
Frank for Gods sake What if he does

CANTON
Right now Im not sure how I stand
I dont think Ive got the support

SMITH
I dont think you have either

CANTON
Maybe I havent made a good enough showing
so far but weve had some tough breaks
I dont want Greaves taking over with
Buffalo so near

SMITH
Frank whats it matter if he does You get
paid whether you ride in front or at the back
What difference does it make

CANTON
I want Im going to suggest we ride
through the night Well get to Buffalo
in the early hours strike before daybreak
I want you to back me up Tom

SMITH
I dont seem to know you these days Frank
I remember you before you ever gave an order
- when you took pride in what you did not
in how many people did it for you

CANTON

Dont lecture me Tom Support ne

- SMPIN

IT wont

From the north a rider-arrives galloping
FRANK CANTON turns and hurries back SMITH at his heels
SHAD reins up in the light of a lantern —

SHAD
Big band coming our way Frank
fhree four miles ahead

He cuietens his horse and jumps down Men gather quickly
clutching bridles

CANTON
Showing lights

SHAD
Not a one

CANTON
But men not cattle

SHAD
(deliberating)
Herd of cows makes a noise These was silent

CANTON

Youre sure of that

GREAVES
Of course hes sure Canton That waggoner
got word to Buffalo and the vigilantes are out

CANTON
We dont know that

SMITH
Steady Frank

EVERETT
(seizing his moment)
Ita like to hear some concrete proposals

CANTON

(snapping)
We ride to Buffalo

EVERETTE
“ ox€mot waiting for a reaction)
Major

GREAVES
We ride to the nearest Company ranch and
go to ground for twenty-four hours
Thatll be the TA ranch Highland

CANTON realises he has been railroaded
So do most of the cowboys but few are shedding tears

EVERETT
Any more proposals Shall we take a vote

GREAVES
Who rides with me

JACK holding the lamp rakes a sea of raised hands

EVERETT
Against

A few Wyoming hands are raised Several men TOM SMITH

among them have not voted

EVERETT
We ride to the TA Ranch Major

GREAVES
(with his 01d clipped economy)
Mount up form two columns
Wagon at the rear The distanee Highland

HIGHLAND
If we leave the road and head southwest

a couple hours ride

GREAVES
Very goo Proceed
In silence please

The MAJORs troop barely mounted moves off
SMITH hands CANTON his reins and rides on

CANPON stares blankly into the northern night
then climbs up and follows them

THE TA RANCH NIGHT The dark interior of a bunkhouse
Snores and sighing breaths the occasional cough

Men sleep in two- and three-tier bunks often more than one
to a cot Those who have not found a bed sleep on the
floor

LEW picks his way among the bodies pausing and trying to
recognise faces or clothing in the half-light At length
he comes upon an empty bunk and an abandoned bedroll
examines it and lets it fall

He opens the door gently and steps outside

A match flares at his elbow

CANTON lights his cigarette and draws deeply on it
He looks briefly at LEW then away into the gloaming
Smoke curls slowly around his nostrils

LEW

(very quietly)
Ive been looking for you for a while

CANTON
You took your time

LEW
I wanted to catch you alone

CANDON
Thats the burden of command Lew Brevett
The boss is never on his own

LEW
Youre not the boss now

CANTON
No Which is lucky for you
(before LEW can speak CANTON asks him a question)
See that How many do you think there are
In spite of himself LEW follews CANIONs gaze

The surrounding hills are black and heavy with grey dawn
a suggestion beyond At first he sees only the hills
then all at once the glint of moving metal shafts the dull
glow of a shielded lanterm

CANTON
I counted twenty before I stopped

LEW
The vigilantes

CANTON
Cant see who else When they missed us
on the road they mustve come straight here
Been here since three Id guess
Setting up going for position The way you
do when youre going to attack at sunup

He laughs softly to himself and finishes the cigarette

CANTON
‘Which still gives you and me time

LEW
(misunderstanding)
Yeah

CANTON
Time to slip through their lines and get
to a telegraph And pray its working

LEW
Why

CANTON
So I can send a wire funnily enough
It was something Everett suggested once
In the event of

He laughs again

CANTON
Wed best be off

LEW
We

CANPONs
I need someone to look out for me Lew

Im gonna be a heros you can be one as well

LEW
Why are you asking me

CANDON

Oh cause you voted for me yesterday

LEW
I didnt vote for you

CANTON
Cause you interest me Cause I havent quite
got you figured out Cause Id like to know
why you killed Gillespie Champion didnt
shoot him He was shot at close quarters
on his way to see you Shall we go

LEW

You dont want me along

CANTON

I still owe you one — remember

LEW
(hoarsely)
Are we going to ride

CANTON grins and steps off the porch

CANTON
Not just yet

THE TA RANCH DAY A couple of hours after dawn

the hills swarm with men and several campfires have been lit
None of the inhabitants of the Ranch shows himself but
within all is turmoil The doors are being barricaded

the windows blocked and gunports established MAJOR GREAVES
engages in tactical discussions and issues terse orders
EVERETT has cornered TOM SMITH who would rather be with his
men DOBSON HIGHLANDs employer and franchise owner of

the Ranch frets and tries to attract attention

Ranch hands included there must be nearly sixty men inside
and every one of them is on the move

GREAVES
I want a man in every upper window and someone
standing by to reload Its not too late to

throw up some kind of breastwork between here and
the creek thats our weakest spot
Mr Dobson How much loose timber -

EVERETT
(grilling SMITE)
Thats why Im asking you

SMITH
He didnt tell me anything
Frank wouldnt run away If hes -

EVERETT
The Major says he did

SMITH
Come on Everett you know him better
tham that If Franks gone its because
Well theres a good reason I hope he
got past them

EVERETT
Then why didnt he tell you

SMITH
We didnt part the best of friends

DOBSON
(to GREAVES)
eee not enough for fortifications

GREAVES
What if we took down the barn

A MAN
Major Greaves Buffalo Sheriffs down
by the creek He wants to talk

GREAVES
Ill speak to -

The prospect of a parlay disintegrates with a burst of firing
outside The Wexans return the fire enthusiastically

THE SURROUNDING HILLS DAY Surprisingly fast for one so
bulky SHERIFF ANGUS stalks up the slope from the stream
Bursts of flame flash from the bushes around him and the air
is thick with smoke and sound Two or three men keep pace
with hin

DEPUTY BASCH comes hot foot down the hill joins the group
and they seek cover

ANGUS
Who started shooting I wanted to talk to them

BASCH
(distracted)
I dont know Sheriff Two of the

horses have been taken Stolen

ANGUS
What do you mean When Just now

BASCH
About an hour ago just after dawn
Stan McCafferty saw ‘em go

ANGUS
Why the hell -

A bullet hits a rock nearby and riehochets away
It is gone before they can even duck

ANGUS
Why didnt he raise the alarm

BASCH
He thought they was our men
One of them was that cousin of Ranger Jones

ANGUS
(letting this digest)
Now hes positive about the identification

BASCH
He was with me when we told Jones missus

ANGUS
And the other man

BASCHs
Couldnt see his face

ANGUS
They must be trying to get a message
through You ride to

Below them a gun misfires and its owner drops it shouting
Men serabble towards him through the bushes

ANGUS
Ride to Ucress The telegraph office
at the railhead Cut the wires

first chance you get

BASCH
Right Whatll you do Sheriff

ANGUS
Im going back to Buffalo and take a bath
(to a companion) Arapahoes in charge
till I get back Dent move on the Ranch
till then

THE TA RANCH DAY The invaders work as a team to defend
the blockhouse For the first time divisive differences

have been set aside GREAVES walks the line of defense
EVERETT is loading at a gunport KINROSS bandages a flesh
would in a Texans arm Glass and splinters fly

the atmosphere is choked with cordite and the noise is
intolerable - yet spirits are high and there is no lack of
resolution

In the corral a dozen yards distant one of the horses stumbles

JEB
Hey Theyre shooting the horses

GREAVES finds a vantage point Another animal falls
GREAVES

Mr Smith Take as many men as you need
and get those animals inside the barn

SMITH moves without a word but EVERETT horrified tries
to intercept hin

EVERETT
You cant ask them that Major
Mr Smith youre not ob —-

SMITH pushes past selecting his men as he goes

A rear door is opened

GREAVES
Full covering fire

EVERETT watehes helpless as they barge out smoky light
flooding in behind them - cut off as the door is slammed

THE CORRAL DAY The Texans break from cover in gingle file
running low for the wooden rail Shots kick up the dirt
but as yet no one has found their range

SMITH vaults the corral fence and lands among the frightened
horses making nimbly for his own animal One man makes
ready to open the gate while others mount bareback

SMITH is already aboard shouting for the rest to follow

Another animal falls

SMITH
Move it Tony the gate

He spurs through the herd giving the uncertain animals

a direction and they start to follow The gate swings
wide and the rush for thick-walled shelter is on

As SMITH leaves the corral his own horse falls pitehing
him forward He tries to land on his feet stumbles
and disappears in a swirl of dust and stamping hooves

Most of the horses reach the barn
Ineessant fire flies in all directions

Almost unaware of the screaming bullets two of SMITHs

men carry him back to the bleckhouse his arms draped
limp across their shoulders

JOHNSON COUNTY DAY FRANK CANTON pulls up out of a
eanter and dismounts LEW reins in ahead and rides back
CANTON
Damn it

He examines the animals foreleg

CANTON
Shes going lame on me Faymers horse

LEW watches him warily from the saddle
They are alone in open country

CANEON
Well have to double up

LEW
(hie gun already drawn)

I dont think go

CANTON straightens and stands not saying a word

LEW
(in a- monotone)
Those men you killed on the Buffalo road
Canton Do you remember their names

CANTON
(angry and at a loss)
Course I dont son — Im always killing
people You expect me to keep some kind
of record

LEW
(long-rehearsed )
John Tisdale and Ranger Jones
Does that mean anything -

CANPON
Not a thing not one damn thing
Cut it out Lew we got a job on our hands

LEW
- mean anything to you
My names Jones too

CANTON
Well its a common enough name But its
a lovely name and I like it very much
Quite a coincidence wouldnt you say

LEW raises the gun aiming at CANTONs chest
CANPON is shouting now

CANTON
For Christs sake Lew

The hand

Theres fifty men in that ranch
Were the only ones who can get them out

holding the gun does not waver

CANTON
If you think youve got a seore to setite
Im not afraid to settle it with you
But lets get that job done first

LEW

CANTON
What do you mean Why
Cause a lot of good men are going to
be killed if we dont Because —
Christ Lew

LEW
(very deliberately)
So what They were going to burn Buffalo

CANTON
You sound like the Major Nothings that
simple Lew Black and white — you cant

break everything down to black and white

They stare at each other in silence

CANTONs

horse starts to wander away

CANTON
Let me send the telegram
Then you can finish this the way you want
LEW
Telegram wont do no good

Cheyennes two days away

CANTON
But Fort McKinney isnt Your people win
either way Lew Whether our boys get
shot by them or jailed by the Army
I dont give a damn what happens to Greaves
and Everett But I dont want Tom Smith
and good men like him massacred

Do you

LEW
Give me your gun

As CANION reaches for it LEW corrects himself

LEW
Left handed

CANTON does as he is told He holds the pistel out
by the barrel LEW moves to take it then draws back
His aim never falters

LEW
Just throw it away

CANTON does so It lands in the damp grass
LEW

Now climb up in front of me
Ill give you till we send the wire

CANTON
Thats all I ask

THE TA RANCH DAY The battle continues more fiercely
than ever Wood and glass splinters erupt across smoke-filled
rooms the debris of fortification is everywhere

KINROSS works under great pressurewith little practical
assistance There are few bullet wounds but many powder

burns and shrapnel injuries The most serious casualty

is SMITH lying on a pallet with makeshift splints on both his
legs JACK tries to make himself useful the other detective
has produced a notebook and is scribbling furiously

A MAN
fFheyre raising another breastwork

GREAVES
We should have done the same

EVERETT
Perhaps its not too late Ma -

GREAVES
(ignoring him)
How many in the barn

MAN

PINKERTON

PENROSE
(wiping the sweat from his eyes)
Bad

THE SURROUNDING HILLS DAY While a phalanx of Buffalo
men maintain a steady fire the rest work behind the lines
binding logs into moveable fortifications
A ginger-bearded rowdy called ARAPAHOE RED direcs the
construction
RED

Leave more of a gap than that Ambrose

You got to poke a rifle txixt those logs

Caint you speed it up We never had

this much time at Heenans Ridge

RED like certain others needs no encouragement to re-fight
the Civil War

MAN

RED

A MAN

Someone laughs REDs beard bristles

RED
Work you bastards

UCROSS RAILHEAD DAY In the glow of late afternoon

LEW and CANTON reach the railroad spur It is very similar
to the one at Casper - a single track ending in sidings

empty pens on one side a rough office on the other

A row of telegraph poles stretches south with the rails

LEW makes CANFON dismount first Then he climbs down
and tethers the horse CANON enters the office

Inside it is unexpectedly light due to gaping holes in
the roof and the absence of a back door

A thin sourfaced CLERK crouches beside a small stove
breaking twigs He scowls at CANPON

CLERK
No trains

CANEON
I want to send a telegram

CANTON rests his right hand on his holster so the CLERK
eannot see it is empty The CLERK makes heavy weather
of the walk to his desk He fishes out some dog-eared
seraps of paper and a pencil

CLERK
Who to

CANTON
Colonel Van Horn Commander Fort McKinney

The CLERK stops writing his face a suden blank
LEW comes into the office

CLERK
I eant send it today of course
The lines are down

CANTON doesnt take his eyes of the CLERK The man stays

quite impassive

CANTON
I dont believe you

The CLERK shrugs and puts his hands in his pockets

CLERK
S true

CANPON
Send it

CANTON glances to LEW for support He finds none
CANTON
(stepping towards the desk)

Send it or Il kill you

The CLERK puts a hand to one of the desk draws
LEW draws his gun

LEW
Bo as he says

The CLERK puts his hands on the desk

CLERK
Whats the message

CANTON nods to LEW a brief unspoken thanks Then he picks up

the paper and seribbles a brief message The CLERK sits
and starts to tap it out on the key LEW and FRANK watch
silently Outside the horse neighs Neither pays any
attention

Suddenly the clatter of the keys changes its tone
The CLERK stops tries a short set of four another

CLERK

Its died on me

CANTON
Dont waste my time

CLERK
(a desperate whisper)
It just cut off

CANTON looks at LEW in disbelief

CLERK
Please I got most of it

LEW lifts the gun till it is inches from his head

A VOICE
Hes telling the truth

All three stare startled at the door

BASCH stands in the doorway with a levelled rifle

BASCH
Pat down your guns please Boys

An armed man appears in the rear doorway another at the
window Like BASCH they wear deputys badges and carry
rifles LEW puts his pistol on the desk

CLERK
This one hasnt got a gun Sheriff

BASCH
(stepping inside)
What were they trying to send

CLERK
A wire to Fort McKinney To get the military

BASCH
How much of it went

CLERK
(unwillingly)
A bit Not the sender

The other deputies enter the cabin One of them frisks
CANTON BASCH stands opposite LEW cradling his rifle
LEW says nothing

BASCH
MeCafferty was right It is you
Him I can understand But you
after what they did to your kin

BASCH runs out of things to say and shakes his head
With sullen speed he smashes the rifle butin LEWs face

THE TA RANCH NIGHT After a day of endless gunfire
the interior of the Ranch is wholly derelict The furniture
has been broken up for firewood and fortifications and the
walls are scarred and pockmarked The mens litter is

strewn about the fleor and hanging gunemoke mingles with
the smoke and smell of cooking Sporadic fire keeps up

outside

GREAVES finds EVERETT sitting listless amid the rubble

GREAVES
Have you seen Mr Dobson

EVERETT
(distantly)
What

GREAVES
Were low on ammunition
I want to know if hes got any stored -

EVERETT
Dobsons gone to bed

GREAVES doesnt seem to understand EVERETT rubs a grubby
hand through his hair

EVERETT
He says hes not coming down until weve
all cleared out of his house Highlands
the only person hell talk to He says
hes sorry he ever opened his doors to us

GREAVES
Well soon see about that Well soon
seé what the Board has to say -

EVERETT ¢

Hes also sorry he ever joined the Board

GREAVES
The devil he is

He rises all set to stamp upstairs but EVERETT

restrains him

EVERETT
Let him be will you Theres no point -
The only ammunition is still in the wagon
Along with food and medical supplies if
they interest you

He lets GREAVES go

GREAVES finds a small group next door in the kitchen
gaunt men with dirt-streaked faces and red—rimmed eyes

MAN
Get a move on will you

COOK
You dont like the service take

your custom elsewhere

GREAVES
Follow me men There are
supplies to salvage

With communal slowness the cowboys start filing out
Then they stop realising one man has not moved

GREAVES

Come on

The loiterer parks himself firmly on the floor
Only when he speaks do we recognise him as SHAD

SHAD
I aint going Not until Ive ate

GREAVES
(almost conciliatory)
I know youre hungry soldier I havent -

SHAD
Soldier You bastard - do it yourself

In a moment GREAVES is erect and glaring his hand on the

revolver holstered crossways on-his chest

GREAVES
Up and out right now

One of the cowboys disappears No one else moves

The food burns on the stove

GREAVES
I will give you till the count of three

SHAD ignores him but his hand is not far from his pistol

Shots crack outside

GREAVES
One

TOM smith appears behind GREAVES supported by a young cowboy

His legs are useless and his pale face streams with sweat

But his voice ig level as he addresses SHAD

SMITH
Do as the bastard tells you

One look at SMITH and SHAD is not prepared to argue
He gets up and joins the others GREAVES follows them
pausing to acknowledge SMITH — but SMITH will have none

of it

SMITH
(with great effort)
You are a bastard Greaves When this
is over Ill be looking for you

As GREAVES walks out SMITHs face contorts with the agony

of an internal wound

GREAVES meets his men at a side door One of them holds
it slightly ajar peering out

MAN
I wouldnt go just yet Major - theres
a couple of men moving around close by

GREAVES peers through a gunport Rifles flash in the distance
but in the nearer darkness nothing stirs

GREAVES
Ours

A dynamite explosion sears the night igniting and uprooting
the corral rails - Thunder rolls about the hills

BUFFALO JAIL NIGHT LEW his face bruised and caked with
blaek bleod lies on a rough bunk eyes closed

Sounds filter through to him and he stirs and opens one eye
He is in an iron—barred eell one of two Plain wooden
walls around the cages a desk and some chairs and an empty
rifle rack

In the next cell three deputies are working over FRANK CANTON
each one holding him in turn as the others lay into him
CANTON has long since ceased to resist There is blood all
over him and the floor LEW rolls onto his side and tries
to sit up but his weakness and the heavy manacles on his
ankles defeat him

ANGUS
Thatll do for now

SHERIFF ANGUS stands just inside CANTONs cell watehing with
detatchment ‘One of the deputies goes on pounding

ANGUS
Theyre waiting for us Ivan

IVAN leaves off and motions through the bars at LEW

IVAN
What about that one

ANGUS ushers them out and locks the door CANTON lies where
they have dropped him

ANGUS
Therell be time

The four men leave the office Through the door
we see many torches burning in the street Someone
shouts as ANGUS appears The last man blows out the lamp

THE HILLS DAY By daylight the Ranch can be seen to
have survived the night Dynamite has gouged craters and
charred the ground and several outbuildings have been
demolished But the bleckhouse and barn are still intact

On a hill overlooking the siegeworks ANGUS and ARAPAHOE RED
are in conference Some thirty men who have arrived with
‘the Sheriff are beying deployed among the breastworks

In the presence of ANGUS RED is uncommonly obsequious

RED
We didnt charge ‘em Sheriff A lot of
the boys wanted to but I said not until
you got back I knew youd want to be
in at the kill

ANGUS
How much dynamite you wasted

RED
We didnt open but one box Sheriff
But the stuffs no use - we cant get
elese enough to throw it
We going to charge them now right

ANGUS
Red have they tried to surrender

RED
No they havent Why dont you
get the men together and —

ANGUS
Red be still and listen to me
I want you to bring that wagon up here
and have it filled with kindling rags
anything thatll burn And see if
Ben Fox has got any long fuses

RED
Gotcha But dont you think «

ANCUS
Chop chop Arapahoe

ARAPAHOE RED stumps off leaving ANGUS alone for a moment
ANGUS watches the Ranch and rubs his beard

THE TA RANCH DAY In the blockhouse a ragged queue

is forming for breakfast No one seems to have slept
Alone in a corner MAJOR GREAVES attempts to shave with a palmful
of water from his canteen EVERETT sits nearby haggered and

filthy in his shirtsleeves Making his first round DOCTOR
KINROSS comes into the alcove where TOM SMITH lies KINROSS
takes one look and walks quickly away ignoring the questioning
glances of the Texans at SMITHs side

He finds GREAVES packing his shaving gear

KINROSS
Major

GREAVES
Morning doctor How are your patients

KINROSS
The only one whose condition worries me
is Smith I dont see But TI
suppose its not my place to comment on morale

GREAVES
Correct

KINROSS
Have you thought about negotiating

GREAVES
Yes doctor I have But now is not the time
We can hold out for at least three days by my
calculations — quite pessibly longer
When they realise that we arent -

KINROSS
What you really mean is that youre not

prepared to make the first move

GREAVES
If you want to put it that way

A shout from one of the lookouts draws GREAVES to a window

LOOKOUT
Major - somethings up

KINROSS puts his medical bag on the table and opens it

GREAVES
What do you make of it

LOOKOUT
Its a wagon but wheres the team

Sure enough a heavy farmers cart is topping the nearest rise
without horses or driver Some of the Texans start to fire

When it reaches the crest a crowd of men is visible pushing
from behind A heavy tarpaulin has been spread over the
load and trailg at the sides Suddenly a man with a lighted
torch appears

TEXAN
Theyre going to fire the Ranch

GREAVES
Every man to his station

ANOTHER
Theyre too far -

Volleys erupt in earnest around them Bullets land at random
on the slope and responding gunfire erupts from the bushes and
the Buffalo siegeworks With the wagon as cover the men on
the hill continue to push it forward

Mindless of te noise and flying debris KINROSS reaches into
his bag and produces a Derringer revolver somewhat gmaller
than his hand EVERETT is the only one to notize

Slowly and with quiet certainty KINROSS lifts the gun and
aims it at the back of GREAVESs head

And fantastically above the noise of battle shouted orders
and booming guns we hear a bugle call

THE HILLS DAY The men behind the wagon have heard
the bugle too - and several of them stop pushing and
stare in the direction of the sound

The wagon slows and stops its dancing fuses hissing
ANGUS grabs one of the defaulters and hurls him back into
line

ANGUS
Push Keep it moving

The bugle sounds again as the shooting subsides
ANGUS spurs his men on with anxious glances at the
western hills

ANGUS
Harder Get it rolling again

Shoulders press on wheel and axle and the wagon lurches
forward There is still flat ground to cover before it
will gather its own momentum and the fuses are shortening
RED leaves off shoving

RED
Shouldnt we wait for them
They can give us a hand -

ANGUS s
You push

He hurls himself against the cart knocking one of his own men
for six and painfully hitting a hinge The shooting has
almost stopped

The wagon covers a mouple more feet and slows again
Suddenly galloping hooves are loud in the air and the
banners of the Sixth and Thirteenth Cavalries wave over the

nearest ridge

ANGUS
Hold it Hold it hold it

He steps away holding his shoulder and watching the
approaching colours

ANGUS
Douse those fuses

THE TA RANCH DAY The last shots are fired and
men desert their posts crowding to the western windows
KINROSS slips the gun back into his bag GREAVES trains
his binoculars on the colours

GREAVES
The Thirteenth -— from Fort McKinney
And the Sixth by God

Not everyone shares the gathering elation
SMITH lies deserted on his pallet coughing blood

And SHAD clutches at a passing Texan in alarm

SHAD
Jesus tell me the truth
Have we got to fight the troopers now

BUFFALO JAIL DAY LEW and CANION sit in silenee in their
cells CANTON bruised and moody gets up and paces then
returns © his bunk He glances coldly at LEW who leoks away
A aeputy watches them from the desk shotgun across his knees

Noises drift in from the street The deputy goes to the
door and leoks out

DEPUTY
(in amazement)
Will you leek at that

He disappears disappears onto the boardwalk
Others run past the doorway in the same directon
LEW and CANTON stare

BUFFALO MAIN STREET DAY A strange procession rides
into town At its head SHERIFF ANGUS ARAPAHOE RED and the
bulk of the Buffalo men stern and upright in the saddle

for the eyes of the town are upon then Next the invaders
on horsebaek and aboard their wagon flanked by ranks of
Cavalry three abreast - Negro Cavalry Then another body
from Buffalo eyeing the backs of the captives

And finally more troops also Black bearing the colours

Townspeople spill into the road there are shouts tentative
cheers andthe men nod grimly tip hats and rest hands on
gunbelts It is an oceasion Wives anxiously identify

their menfolk children point out the villains and gape at
the Blacks old timers slap thighs and cackle saloon keepers
rub their hands

The cavalcade halts with the first of the prisoners beside

the jail ANGUS doubles back down the street and meets
BRIGGS the Captain of Cavalry - a pale young man with cropped
hair and a Custer moustache

ANGUS
Captain if youll help us get em inside -

BRIGGS dismounts and peers into the jail The deputy
watches him ill-at-ease

BRIGGS
All of them Sheriff Angus
Do you want to put all these men in there

ANGUS
(without humour )
Only till the extensions built on the hotel

BRIGGS
Sergeant Bradley clear this porch and
have the prisoners escorted inside

BRADLEY highest-ranking of the Blaeks reels off loud orders
to the troops

The soldiers form a cordon leading into the jail between the
prisoners and the gathering crowd Their movements are
practisec and precise It is the first time we have seen
orders given without a hot debate ensuing

ANGUS nods to the officer

ANGUS
Now gentlemen if youd care to step
this way your accommodation is prepared

There is no lightness in his manner nor in the prisoners
reactions as they file in preceded by armed and edgy deputies
Within the jail the mood changes dramatically - JEB nursing
a wounded arm is one of the first inside and his eyes ignite
with pleasure

JEB
Shad See what we got here

While he and the other cowboys wait for the cell doors to
be unlocked SHAD joins them

SHAD
Well Ill be damned Heres a
man whose hand Ill shake

And when CANPONs cell is opened he does just that

The men flock almost eagerly into the two enclosures
greeting and grabbing CANTON and — much to his astonishment -
LEW

VOICES
My favorite deserter -
Mister Western Union himself

How was the vacation hero

MAJOR GREAVES needless to say is the last to enter
When all his men are inside he turns to BRIGGS on the goardwalk

GREAVES
Thank you Captain Briggs
Your handling of the cease-fire and
our escort has been exemplary

ANGUS
(shoving him)
Get - Inside

GREAVES sniffs and stands his grounds and out of the blue
gives BRIGGS a smart salute Taken aback BRIGGS returns it
MAJOR GREAVES marches into the jail

In the cells now so tightly packed that it is impossible
for the inmates even to sit pandemonium reigns
Everybody talks the bars are rattled and excited men
sway in clusters around LEW and CANTON

LEW ignoring the questions that are being fired at him
strains to hear what CANTON is saying next door
He looks afraid

JEBs
What did you say in the wire Frank

CANTON
Not a lot Some stuff about an armed rebellion

Laughter and sarcastic offerings
LEW resists the jostling barrage

SHAD s
Did you have to make em send it Frank

FRANK CANTON pauses and briefly catches LEWs eye through
the press Then though he fs lost to sight his reply is
clear
CANTON
Nope Lew did the persuading for me

THE STREET DAY From the door of his office conscious
of and embarrassed by the noise from within ANGUS looks with
little affection at the troopers lining the street

The posse has begun to disperse but some of its members hang
around wanting to speak to him

Close by BRIGGS confers with the SERGEANT

ANGUS
Ah - Captain Briggs Id like to thank
you for your help Therell be no more
trouble

BRIGGS
(smiling for he too is a diplomat)
I wish I could rely on that Sheriff

ANGUS
Take my word

BRIGGS smiles again and goes back to his conversation
with BRADLEY

BRIGGS
Sergeant I want you to patrol

ANGUS
Captain would you tell your men
to get out of my office

BRIGGS stiffens

BRIGGS
(with quiet authority)
Perhaps I didnt make my position clear
Sheriff My orders from Colonel Van Horn
were to separate the two warring factions
in Johnson County and see that no further -

ANGUS
There are no two warring factions Captain
There was one bunch of bandits that came to
leot the -

BRIGGS
Sheriff Angus the politics of it dont
interest me -Im just earrying out my

orders which are to keep these men and

the townspeople apart — with your cooperation
I hope - until I receive further instructions
from Fort MeKinney or the Governor

ANGUS
In Cheyenne

BRIGGS
That is the State Capital I believe

THE JAIL DAY Deputy IVAN enters by a rear door bringing
with him a drab little man in untidy black He shouts through
the bars and the din quiets unnaturally at his words

IVAN
Prentiss here wants to know the
details of the man who died

PRENTISS
(fussily)
His name and address The cause of death
That sort of thing

DOCTOR KINROSS squeezes through till he faces the undertaker
CANPON frowns unenlightened No one looks at hin

KINROSS
The mans mame was Tom Smith from Texas
Fractured ribs that pierced his lungs
Internal haemmorages
He died in the wagon

BUFFALO MAIN STREET NIGHT Troopers stand guard on the
Sheriffs porch and others patrol the alleys in pairs

A small knot of men straggles down the street talking low
A stone flies out of the darkness and lands on the boardwalk
with a clatter None of the soldiers moves

The door opens releasing lamplight and mens voices and
SERGEAN BRADLEY appears He looks to his men sees all
there is to see and shuts the door

Not far away a shout unintelligible and obscene is heard

On the opposite side of the street a woman stands heavy purse
in hand watching the jail Laughter wafts through a bright
barred window The woman stares

It is BRENDA

CLARION SALOON NIGHT In a tebacco haze a score of tables
are packed with men whose twenty conversations vary the same theme
ARAPAHOE RED holds forth at the bar ANGUS is at the center

of the largest discussion-group

A MAN
still outnumber them So why dont we
just go in there and do what weve always meant to

ANOTHER
If it means tangling with the troopers -

ANOTHER
Theres still more of us than there is then

ANOTHER
What do you think Will

ANGUS
You want to know what I think
I think were all behaving like a bunch of
boogers thats going to pass out at 2 am
and have a bad head all tomorrow

MAN
So you reckon we ought to act right
ANGUS
Like hell
Theyd really go for that in Cheyenne The
rustlers and murderers that shot at the Cavalry

ANOTHER
What do you mean in Cheyenne
We got Cheyenne right here

ANGUS
No we havent Ive a list in my office of
exactly who we got - and its not very
exciting reading Out of more than fifty men
we got just two board members a doctor two
Pinkerton detectives one of whom claims hes a
reporter and wants letting out so he can wire
his paper — and a lot of range scum and drifters

MAN
And Frank Canton

ANGUS

Cantons just seum in my book

ANOTHER
Someone said there was kin of Ranger
Jones in with ‘em

ANGUS takes a drink

ANGUS
Who said 40

His informant shrugs and pours more whiskey

ANGUS
Well I dont know about that

MAN
So you figure we do nothing Even if it means
another phoney trial with Justice Parmalee -

ANOTHER
We fought them for two days Goddamit

ANOTHER
After what they done at the KC ranch

ANGUS
I know it all

You havent got to tell me This morning
there wasnt nothing I wouldnt give to see
that ranch go up in flames I hate them
And I hate them more than ever now because

theyre going to get away with what they done

The group is silent letting him speak

ANGUS
But if we open fire at the US
Cavalry thats it

MAN
Damn it all Will - theyre niggers

ANGUS
You think that doesnt gall-me
fo have them in my office right now
and nothing I can do about it

He stares at’his whiskey and suddenly toeses it back

ANGUS

Which reminds me

ANGUS gets up and walks straight to the bar where ARAPAHOE
RED is holding forth The others follow him

RED
So there I am all ready to storm the

Ranch like we did at Heenans Ridge
when Angus —

He becomes aware of the SHERIFFs presence
ANGUS

Red If you dont mind Ive come
to pound the shit out of you

RED
(genuinely alarmed for all hig size)
Why Sheriff

ANGUS
I couldnt begin to explain

They tangle fists flying and collapse in a flailing
bundle on the nearest table In sectonds as expected

the saloon is abrawl

THE GOVERNORS RESIDENCE NIGHT In a long high-ceilinged
corridor hung with crystal a dapper man is waiting
A stately clock ticks and a womans voice drifts faintly

from another floor

Double doors part opened by a footman in livery
The flunky bows as a frock-coated SECRETARY backs out

with a sheaf of papers under his arm

SECRETARY
Ill see you Wednesday
Have a nice evening
(to the one who waits)
The Governor will see you now Mr Heppler

HEPPLER
Thank you Mr Secretary

SECRETARY
(aside)
Try not to keep him too long
pa os

es ee ee

He has a box for Mr Wildes show
at the Apollo

HEPPLER nods in willing acquiescence and is ushered
into the Presence We hear the GOVERNORs voice

GOVERNOR
Heppler is it Why the devil wasnt
I kept up to date on this bus —

The footman shuts the doors

BUFFALO MAIN STREET DAY A new troop of Cavalry
whites of the Sixth line the street as SHERIFF ANGUS
tired bruised and disinterested reads a telegram to
the gathering crowd

ANGUS

Cheyenne Wyoming April 15th

WE Angus Sheriff of Johnson County -
You are hereby instructed by special order
of President McKinley to deliver at once
to Colonel Van Horn the men who are-naw
confined in the County Jail at Buffalo
These men cannot be left in the hands of
the civil authorities due to the excitement
and hostile atmosphere of the vicinity

For its own safety the party is to be
escorted with all possible haste and
without harrassment to the railway spur

at Ucross where they will board a

special train

Amos W Barber
Acting Governor

ANGUS folds the paper and puts it carefully away
The angry noises of the crowd almost drown the cheers
coming from the jailhouse

THE JAIL DAY A line of cowboys stretches from the
cells to ANCUS desk where they must sign their release
papers and retreive belongings BASGH presents each man
with two copies for signature

LEWs turn comes BASCH sees his name looks briefly up
and ignores him as he signs the other copy A Black
Trooper leads him into the street

TROOPER
If you see your horse pick it out

The street has been cordoned off and the barriers are
patrolled by troops A fast—diminishing herd is ground-
reined in the road and wagons wait for those who will not
find a horse The crowd beyond the fence watches and
jeers LEW avoids eye contact with any of them

He chooses a mount and joins the others SHAD and JEB
regale him CANTON stands by the tie rail tightening

a cinch

When MAJOR GREAVES emerges it is time to go

The repes are lowered a path is cleared through the crowd
The caravan begins to move The invaders in excellent
spirits for the most part are flanked and preceeded by

the augmented troops in strict formation followed by their
wagon and a body of determined townsmen

There are catcalls angry gestures thrown stones and mud
but the anger is directed against the troops more than the
cowboys safely insulated by a layer of Black in blue

Or almost insulated

LEW riding with eyes downcast hears someone call his name

He looks up and there is BRENDA — staring fiercely anxiously
at him from the edge of the crowd

Confused for a moment he reins up and other horses pause

and edge past him He tries to squeeze between his guards

TROOPER ¢
Back in line Mister

LEW draws almost level with BRENDA stops again

He starts to speak and she steps out of the crowd pulling
the RANGERs gun from her heavy handbag aiming it at
arms length

FRANK CANTON rides past

LEW does not move The TROOPER grabs his bridle and pulls
it hard as the gun explodes and a bullet almost knocks LEW
from the saddle

A dismounting soldier dives for BRENDA before she can
fire again and the crowd wells out and swallows them

Fists fly and some of the horses panic
BRIGGS
Keep moving Keep ‘em moving out

A BACK ROOM IN BUFFALO DAY PRENTISS the Undertaker
sits beside LEW dressing his arm His severed shirtsleeve
is drenched in blood but he is pale and alive

ANGUS and SERGHAN BRADLEY stand nearby

BRADLEY
How soon can he travel Doctor

PRENTISS
I wouldnt put him on a horse this
minute Its quite a shock to the
system being shot

ANGUS
If you want to get back to your
Company Sergeant Ill see him safely
out of town

BRADLEY
(unconvinced)
Ill wait
bandages

PRENPISS beége ponderously

LEW
I want to see her Sheriff

ANGUS
Serry son

LEW
Its important

ANGUS shakes his head

ANGUS
The woman that shot you — whoever she was

got away in the crowd

LEW
Ive got to explain to her

ANGUS
And nobody knowe who she was
because if they did these gentlemen
would make me arrest her For attempted
marder of a Cattle Company empleyee

LEW looks at ANGUS and understands

LEW
Iq like to leave a letter with you

ANGUS
I wouldnt know what to do with it
(to BRADLEY) I think hes ready to
travel Sergeant Right Doc

PRENTISS
Oh right

BRADLEY nods and goes to the door He calls a waiting Trooper

BRADLEY
Bring the horses round back

-PRENTISS
(to LEW)
Thatll be a dollar Mister

LEW fishes in his vest pocket for money with his good right hand
BRADLEY crosses to the back door and opens it -
he stands waiting half inside

PRENTISS

LEW
(low-voiced)
Sheriff Ive got to leave Brenda
a message To tell her I -

engages BRADLEY in same meaningless conversation

ANGUS

(hard and level)
Now you listen to me You had your chance
with Brenda and you passed it up
Not so long ago I understood you were out to
get the man who killed your cousin
I believed you But somewhere along the way
you must have forgotten because that mans
still alive

LEW
Its not that simple

ANGUS
I dont expect it is
But killings gone unpunished
a lot more of it since those fine words
of yours I think maybe youre still
sincere though Brenda doesnt
Well if you are you prove it

We hear horses in the back yard
ANGUS looks bitterly at his tin badge of office

ANGUS
I eant do nothing with this
If anyones gonna set things straight

its a free agent like you
I only wish -

BRADLEY
Get your hat

ANGUS never finishes

UCROSS RAILHEAD DAY BRADLEY and the TROOPER escort
LEW up the last rise before the spur

BRADLEY
Looks like your ftflends didnt wait

The deadend tracks are deserted scattered with the litter
of a hasty departure The wagon its axle broken empty
supply boxes discarded items of all kinds

Far away over the railroad line hangs a dissipating cloud

of smoke

The Troopers wheel about heading north

BRADLEY s
Maybe youll catch ‘em up at Casper

TROOPER

Some chance

LEW ignores them and starts down the hill
He rides slowly his shoulder paining him
The soldiers recede

When he reaches the railhead a man steps out from the
of the telegraph office
It is FRANK CANTON

CANTON
(pleasantly)
Hi

LEW stops on the other side of the tracks

CANTON
Hows the arm

LEW dismounts in silence
CANTON

I figured youd come after me anyway
So I thought - What the hell

shade

CANTON is finally resigned

CANTON
Well lets get to it

He stands like a gunfighter feet apart right hand a few
inches from his holster — which this time holds a gun

LEW doesnt respond

CANTON
Lew

LEW
(taking his time)
Was it you or not

CANTON
That what

LEW
Killed the Ranger

It wasnt was it

CANTON
bh It wasnt
Thats never been my style -
though I came close to it on this trip

LEW

(angrily)
You could have told me before

CANTON
(shaken with silent laughter
and release)
You didnt ask me

LEWs
Its not the sort of thing you ask
Who was it then

Now it is CANTONs turn to pause

CANTON
Thats not for me to say

LEW stiffens

CANTON
Id hate to shoot you
Specially now theres no need

LEW
Tell me who did it

CANTON
Even if I knew I wouldnt tell you
Youll have to ask Everett

LEW
Everett -— not Greaves

CANTON
I dont believe Greaves even knew about it
The Major fires but Everett does the hiring

LEW stares at him a moment longer then breathes out
believing

LEW
Want to come along

CANTON
Me What for

LEW shakes his head and turns away

CANTON
(defensively)
Im not fool enough to fight the Company

The Cavalry are out of sight
The train is just a distant trail of smoke among the hills

LEW swings into the saddle painfully and starts to
follow that trail

FRANK CANTON watches him go

Greg Hersov and Nick Hunt) planned or idly desired to ‘filmi in Alm
Spain in the summer of 1976 or 1977

Together we wrote a script for it now lost lamentably titled San Lamento
San Lamento was never made but my enthusiasm for the location - El Llano del
remained and I shot there in my student film BLACK HILLS and in the sequal STRAIGHT TO
