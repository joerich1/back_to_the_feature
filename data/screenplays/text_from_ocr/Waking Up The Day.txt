FADE IN

EXT A COUNTRY ROAD NEAR NEWPORT RHODE ISLAND —- DAY

Maple trees sway back and forth A cold Spring rain splatters
on the ground BEGIN TITLES as

A Toyota Land Cruiser and a Ford sedan with rental plates
splash down a country road

EXT IRON GATES - DAY

The rain falls harder as GEORGE PETERSON a young lawyer
wearing a raincoat unlocks the padlock on a heavy chain
wrapped around a black iron gate

The gates screech as he pushes them open Raindrops explode
on the asphalt driveway as he waves the Ford sedan forward

ANGLE - THE FORD SEDAN

The Ford drives ten feet up the driveway then the driver
stops to let Peterson close the gates DOLLY TOWARD the Ford
and we see

CHARLIE GORDON

peering out the fogged-up windshield REVERSE ANGLE and we
see that the 40-year-old Charlie is looking at

A HUGE VICTORIAN MANSION

that overlooks the Atlantic Ocean The three-story mansion is
painted white and has a turret at each corner In the rain
it looks like a haunted castle in a fairy tale END TITLES
and --

CUT TO

INT RANDOLPH MANSION - VESTIBULE —- DAY

As Peterson forces opens the stuck front door The wind howls
into the dark house as the two men stumble inside

Peterson slams the door shut Charlie walks down a short
hallway and looks into the front dining room

A dusty chandelier hangs from the ceiling The furniture is
covered with sheets
PETERSON
Cold

CHARLIE
It wasnt much warmer when my
grandmother lived here She thought
central heating was for wimps

Peterson opens up a briefcase and pulls out a wad of legal
papers

PETERSON
Anywayheres the will The
codicil to the will The codicil to
the codicil of the will And the
deed to the house

CHARLIE
Thank you Mr Peterson

PETERSON
Having fulfilled my fiduciary
duties I am now getting the hell
out of here

CHARLIE

Peterson heads for the front door then stops and looks at
Charlie

PETERSON
Excuse me Mr Gordon But youre
not going to stay here Are you

CHARLIE
I think theres enough room

PETERSON
Theres no power No heat I bet
this place gets kind of spooky at
night

CHARLIE
Dont worry The ghosts will keep
me company

INT RANDOLPH MANSION - NIGHT
We hear a JAZZ solo by Lester Young Carrying a lighted

candle Charlie walks slowly up the broad staircase to the
second floor
INT RANDOLPH MANSION - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Charlie enters a shadowy room dominated by a canopied bed A
black leather saxophone case is on the mahogany dresser Its
covered with thin layer of dust

Charlie opens the case -- revealing a tenor saxophone The
gold-plated metal gleams in the candlelight

The JAZZ MUSIC becomes louder as Charlie opens up one of the
compartments built into the instrument case Re pulls out

CLOSE-UP - A BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPH

We see the 8-year-old Charlie sitting in a night club with
his uncle NATHAN RANDOLPH Nathan is holding a saxophone

ANGLE - CHARLIE

Rain rattles on the roof Theres an ominous THUMPING SOUND
as a loose shutter bangs against the house

Charlie walks to the window and pushes back a lace curtain
He looks out the window and sees

CHARLIES POV
A torn piece of newspaper flutters across the driveway

DISSOLVE TO

EXT RANDOLPH MANSION DRIVEWAY - FLASHBACK — DAY

Its May 1962 Gas is cheap and no one worries about
cholesterol The cars are fat American and made of steel

A battered Rambler station wagon putters up the driveway and
stops in front of the mansion

CHARLIE (0S)
Is this where Grandmother lives

ELIZABETH (0S)
Thats right

INSIDE THE CAR

The EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHARLIE sits in the passenger seat holding
his pet hamster Godzilla

ELIZABETH GORDON Charlies mother sits behind the steering
wheel Shes normally a warm pleasant woman but right now
she looks tense and worried

Instead of getting out of the car she lights a cigarette
Charlie stares at the mansion

CHARLIE
It looks like a castle

ELIZABETH
Your great-grandfather visited a
lot of castles when he toured
Europe I guess he wanted to build
one when he returned to America

CHARLIE
What do you think Godzilla Cool
Huh

ELIZABETH

What is that hamster doing out of
his cage

CHARLIE
Godzilla likes to be free

ELIZABETH
Rodents dont have spiritual
desires dear Were going to be at
your grandmothers house for the
whole summer and you must keep him
in his cage

CHARLIE
Maybe shell like him

ELIZABETH
No she wont And she wont like
you if you dont behave yourself

Elizabeth gathers her courage and opens the car door
ANGLE - CHARLIE AND ELIZABETH

Leaving Godzilla in his cage Charlie gets out of the station
wagon and walks across the driveway with his mother

ELIZABETH
Its important that your
grandmother likes you Charlie
Now that your fathers dead
CHARLIE
Dont talk about him

ELIZABETH
-Now that your fathers dead we
need some financial help or we
wont be able to keep our house

She drops the cigarette rubs it out with her pink pump and
rings the doorbell

CHARLIE
Did she go to the doctor

ELIZABETH
What are you talking about

CHARLIE
Daddy told me that grandmother
should go to a doctor because she
had a poker up her butt

Elizabeths head whips around but before she can react
ELLEN CALLAGHAN
opens the front door Ellen is the part-time summer cook

Shes a big-boned woman in her fifties with a no-nonsense
manner

ELLEN
Elizabeth Weve been waiting for
you

ELIZABETH

Hello Ellen
Charlie and his mother enter
THE MANSION ENTRYWAY

Charlie glances in the living room His grandmother has never
thrown anything away and the house is crammed with over-
stuffed sofas coat racks and paintings of various
relatives

There are priceless articles --- like a jade chess set ---
that share the same space with a folding card table from
Sears The house looks like a cross between a museum and a
rummage sale

ELLEN
You look wonderful
The two women hug each other

ELIZABETH
Im surviving

CHARLIE
(to Ellen)
Are you my grandmother

ELLEN
God save me if I am

ELIZABETH
This is Ellen Callaghan our summer

ELLEN

Summer slave you mean

THERESA SPINOLA the downstairs maid walks into the hallway
Theresa is a slender Portuguese-American woman in her late
thirties

THERESA
Got a hug for me

ELIZABETH
Theresa Youre still here Oh
this is wonderful

She gives Theresa a hug as Ellen stares at Charlie

ELLEN
Look at this Theresa Its
Elizabeths little boy

THERESA
Thank god you dont look like your
grandmother

A door slams open and JULIA DOOLITTLE Elizabeths younger
sister comes running down the hallway Aunt Julia is a small
woman who dresses in a girlish style -- all flutter and
flounce

AUNT JULIA
Oh Oh Oh I just knew I heard a
car on the driveway
(hugs Elizabeth)

drive up from New York
ELIZABETH
Charlie this is your Aunt Julia

CHARLIE

baby and you peed in my face

The women laugh and Charlie looks embarrassed
ANGLE - THE HALLWAY
Charlie follows his mother and Aunt Julia down a long

hallway All the curtains are drawn tight and the house is
filled with shadows in the afternoon

ELIZABETH
How is she
AUNT JULIA
The same
ELIZABETH
Is she still mad at me for getting
married
AUNT JULIA

Shes mad at everyone all the time
Lizzy Once you realize that it
makes things easier

INT THE MUSIC ROOM —- DAY

They enter the oak-lined music room thats filled with the
concert-sized Steinway piano

Charlies grandmother HELEN RANDOLPH sits on a priceless
Louis Quatorze chair and cuts out moneysaver coupons from the
paper

In the 1920s Helen was considered one of the most beautiful
debutantes in America Shes still attractive in her sixties
but our main impression of her is determined by her strong
character This is one tough woman

HELEN RANDOLPH
You came back
ELIZABETH
Yes mother

HELEN RANDOLPH
You stood right here -- right in
this room -- and said that you were
going to marry that little schemer

ELIZABETH
Hes dead mother

HELEN RANDOLPH

Bad stock doesnt last

ELIZABETH
I will not allow you to say
anything against Frank Do you

house again

HELEN RANDOLPH
Well you havent changed Youre
still disrespectful while your
sisters still a silly piece of
fluff

AUNT JULIA

AUNT JULIA
Yes mother

ELIZABETH
I loved my husband and I dont want
to hear him criticized

HELEN RANDOLPH
All right Let the dead stay dead

She stands up and walks over to Charlie

HELEN RANDOLPH
And whats this

ELIZABETH
Your grandson -- Charles David
Gordon
Grandmother looks at Charlie as if he was a dog in a pet
shop

HELEN RANDOLPH
Well hes got my fathers eyes my
mothers ears and possibly -- just
possibly -- his Great Aunts
cheekbones Can you talk boy

Intimidated by this formidable woman Charlie stays quiet
Grandmother turns to Elizabeth

HELEN RANDOLPH
He doesnt talk

ELIZABETH

CHARLIE
Hi Grandma

HELEN RANDOLPH

(triumphantly)
You came back
INT RANDOLPH MANSION - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
That night Charlie Elizabeth Aunt Julia and Grandmother
eat dinner on the marble-topped table in the huge dining

room

Theres a linen table cloth and silver candlesticks but
Theresa serves the meal on plastic plates

Charlie places his knife on the edge of the plate and uses
to hide his peas Aunt Julia babbles while she eats

it

AUNT JULIA
Rodger is my husband so I ama
little partial but I must admit
that his idea of build-it-yourself
bomb shelters is brilliant Just
look at the newspapers Everyones
worried about the Russians and

HELEN RANDOLPH
Excuse me but we have a problem
here

Charlie looks up and realizes that all three women are
staring at him

HELEN RANDOLPH
If I take the trouble to plana
balanced meal and Ellen cooks it
and Theresa brings it out from the
kitchen the least we can do is eat
it All of it

Charlie glances at his mother for help and she motions at her
plate Even Aunt Julia gets into the act --- mouthing the
word peas

HELEN RANDOLPH
The peas Charles Eat your peas

CHARLIE
Yes Grandmother

He tries to scoop up the peas with his fork but they keep
dropping off Finally he manages to get a few in his mouth

HELEN RANDOLPH
Elizabeth I dont think your son
has been observing proper table
manners at home

A fly lands on Charlies baked potato and he waves it away

ELIZABETH
Hes trying Mother

HELEN RANDOLPH
When you finally get the food in
your mouth Charles -- you should
chew it 20 times on the left side
of your jaw and 20 times on the
right side of your jaw It aids the
digestion

Charlie tries to follow her instructions He starts to count
chews on his fingers The fly settles briefly next to his
water glass

AUNT JULIA
Well as I was saying Rodger does
have a good head for business
opportunities and

HELEN RANDOLPH
Im not loaning your husband any
more money Julia Its like
throwing cash out the window of a
moving car

The fly lands next to one of the silver candlesticks Charlie
raises his eyebrows --- its time for the kill

AUNT JULIA
This isnt a loan Mother Its an
investment Talk to the people at
your bank and have them look at the
prospectus
Charlie swats at the fly but misses

The candlestick topples over Charlie jumps up and tries to
catch it

He slips on the wood floor starts to fall grabs the table
cloth and

Drags the plates silverware water glasses --- everything
in fact --- onto the floor

Dead silence Then Grandmother points her finger at the boy
HELEN RANDOLPH
To bed No supper Immediately
EXT ESTABLISHING SHOT - RANDOLPH MANSION - NIGHT
A three-quarter moon makes the lawn around the mansion glow
with soft silver light
INT ELIZABETHS BEDROOM - NIGHT
Wearing a robe Charlies mother opens up the bottom drawer

of a bedroom dresser A stack of old black and white
photographs are in the drawer and she takes them out

CLOSE-UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS

Elizabeth shuffles through various baby pictures Suddenly
she discovers a large photo of herself and Julia at a charity
ball The left third of the photo has been torn away You can
only see a mans leg and left hand

Disturbed Elizabeth touches the edge of the torn photograph

EXT HELENS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Helen sits in her shadowy bedroom and stares out the window

INT CHARLIES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Charlie lies awake in a four-poster bed The room is filled
with cast-off furniture end an ancient rowing machine
Godzilla is locked in his cage -- running frantically in his
hamster wheel

The wind comes off the Atlantic and rattles the windows
Charlie hears a rumbling sound then realizes that its his
own stomach Hes hungry

INT SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY — NIGHT

Hearing his striped pajamas Charlie walks down the dark
hallway past a series of closed doors

He reaches the top of the staircase and steps down The wood
creaks loudly Charlie stops moving and listens to the house
it squeaks and rattles and sighs like a living creature
Charlie walks down the dark hallway Suddenly he sees

A man looming over him

Charlie shudders He almost runs then he realizes

Its only a suit of armor standing on a small platform
Charlie walks up to the armor and touches the breastplate

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

Moonlight shines through the kitchen window and the white
cupboards have an eerie glow

Charlie approaches the refrigerator Then he hears a faint
noise -- its filtering through the basement door on the
other side of the room

Charlie walks over to the door and discovers that its locked
with a latch and a large brass padlock

He puts his ear to the keyhole and hears a frightening noise
coming from the basement

Its a high-pitched wail that sounds as if an enormous animal
is being tortured Suddenly --

A door slams Footsteps Someones walking through the dining
room to the kitchen

Charlie panics and runs out the side door to the library
CAMERA REMAINS in the kitchen as the dining room door opens

Ellen Callaghan enters carrying a flashlight The cook looks
powerful and sinister in the shadowy room

INT KITCHEN —- DAY

The next morning The sunlight shines through the window as
Charlie sits in the kitchen eating his Post Toasties

Ellen and Theresa ignore the boy The cook takes the brown
paper off a recently purchased pot roast and prods the meat
with her thumb

ELLEN
How am I supposed to cook dinner
with this Its all fat and
gristle

THERESA
What can you expect from the
butcher Mrs Randolph hasnt paid
on her account for almost a year

ELLEN
I have half a mind to keep a bull
in the basement and slaughter it
myself

This last comment gets a reaction from Charlie He looks
across the room The basement door is still locked but he
cant hear the wailing sound

EXT ESTATE GROUNDS - DAY

That afternoon Charlie walks across the immense lawn that
surrounds the estate You can see the gray-green water of the
Atlantic Ocean in the distance

INT ESTATE BARN —- DAY

Fifty years ago Charlies great-grandfather kept several
horses on the estate Now the barn is filled with ancient
lawnmowers and boxes of junk

Charlie pushes open the creaky barn door A flock of pigeons
rise up from the rafters and fly out through a hole in the
wall The boy walks forward and sees

A MOTORCYCLE

covered with a stained canvas tarp

A FEW SECONDS LATER

He pulls off the tarp and discovers an old Harley-Davidson
motorcycle that has been in a bad accident The handlebars
and the front steering fork are bent

Impressed Charlie reaches out and touches the black rubber
hand grip

EXT MANSION TERRACE —- DAY

An hour later Elizabeth Aunt Julia and their mother sit
drinking tea on the flagstone terrace behind the house The
sky is clear and waves are crashing on the private beach

The three women watch Charlie walking across the lawn

ELIZABETH
Are there any children in the area
that Charlie could play with

HELEN RANDOLPH
Not really All the people you grew
up with are dead or moved away

ELIZABETH
I dont want him to be bored this
summer

HELEN RANDOLPH
Hell be busy enough Im going to
teach him Latin Algebra -- or
table manners

EXT GARDENERS COTTAGE - DAY

Charlie approaches the ramshackle gardeners cottage -- a
two-room house at the edge of the lawn

All the windows are boarded up The door is held on only one
hinge Charlie pushes open the door and enters --

ANGLE - THE COTTAGE

All the furniture has been smashed or overturned Books jazz
records and old magazines lie on the floor This was an act
of destruction -- not just neglect

Charlie stands in the middle of the wreckage He looks around
and sees a photo pinned to the wall (from Downbeat Magazine)

Its a picture of Charlie Parker playing his saxophone

ELIZABETH (0S)
Charlie What are you doing

Charlie spins around and sees his mother in the doorway

CHARLIE
Just looking around

ELIZABETH
Come out of here Right now

Charlie follows his mother back to the mansion

CHARLIE
Its all messed up

ELIZABETH
Dont you ever go in there again

CHARLIE
Why not

ELIZABETH
And dont mention the cottage to
your grandmother It will only make
her angry

As Charlie and Elizabeth approach the terrace Charlie sees --

ANGLE - THE TERRACE
Helen stares out at the sea while Julia chatters on

AUNT JULIA
SO I decided on the green shoes
with the green dress but that
looked so boring that I started to
look for some blue shoes you know
dark blue

A gorilla --- or rather a man wearing a rubber gorilla mask -
-- steps out onto a terrace carrying a briefcase The gorilla
walks quietly over to Julia (she cant see him)

AUNT JULIA
But they really dont have dark
blue this season -- everythings
kind of turquoisey So I decided on
black -- black is always a safe
choice but

The gorilla taps Aunt Julia on the shoulder She turns around
and SCREAMS The gorilla pulls off his mask and becomes
Julias plump husband --- RODGER DOOLITTLE

AUNT JULIA
Oh Rodger

UNCLE RODGER
Made you jump a mile

EXT MANSION TERRACE - NIGHT

Six hours later The terrace is empty Peering through the
French doors we can see Charlie and his family eating at the
dining room table

INT DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Uncle Rodger has consumed too much wine Hes still trying to
coax Helen into investing in his bomb shelter scheme

UNCLE RODGER
Suppose the Russians attack us
Were only going to have a few
minutes to get to safety Public
shelters are too crowded and too
far away People are going to need
my build-it-yourself bomb shelters

HELEN RANDOLPH
If the Russians decide to destroy
Newport I shall walk out on the
lawn and face them

She stares at Charlie

HELEN RANDOLPH
Randolphs have moral fiber

INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

That night Mustering up all his courage Charlie steps out
into the shadowy hallway

HELEN RANDOLPH (VO)
If were frightened of something
we face it We dont run away

ANGLE - CHARLIE

As Charlie walks past Rodger and Julias bedroom he hears
their voices through the door

AUNT JULIA (0 S )
Youve got to find someone for
Elizabeth

INTERCUT WITH
ANGLE - RODGER AND JULIA

Julia sits at a vanity table and dabs cold cream on her face
Rodger is clipping his nose hair

UNCLE RODGER
What about the butcher If Lizzy
sweet-talks him maybe we could get
a better pot roast

AUNT JULIA

someone whos established
Suitable

UNCLE RODGER
Nobody is gonna want a woman with a
kid Its extra baggage She should
get rid of Charlie Send him off to
school

INT KITCHEN —- NIGHT

Cautiously Charlie enters the kitchen He can hear the
wailing sound coming from the basement

Charlie approaches the bedroom door then hears the floor
creak Someones coming The boy looks around desperately

A FEW SECONDS LATER

Wearing a bathrobe Ellen walks into the kitchen and switches
on the light No ones there

CHARLIE

hides in the broom closet and peers out a crack in the door
ELLEN

unlocks the refrigerator She takes out some leftovers ---
chicken two apples a piece of cherry pie --- and places
them on a serving tray

CHARLIE

steps backwards A mop falls off a hook but he catches it in
time He peers out the crack and sees --

ELLEN

attached to a gold-colored key and opens the door

Ellen carries the food tray into the basement and closes the
door behind her

Charlie comes out of the closet A Beat then the wailing
stops

INT THE BACK LAWN - DAY

The next morning Elizabeth and Aunt Julia play badminton on
the back The two sisters laugh and shout at each other For

a few minutes they both feel like teenagers

REVERSE ANGLE TO

INT THE MUSIC ROOM —- DAY

Grandmother looks out the window at her daughters Charlie
sits on a chair thumbing through a photo album He sees
pictures of his mother and Aunt Julia when they were girls

HELEN RANDOLPH
Ill say one thing about your
mother Shes not a silly woman
except when shes around her
sister Maybe silliness is a virus -
- you can catch it from others

Charlie turns a page of the album and notices something
There are discolored patches on the paper as if photographs
have been removed

He looks up Grandmothers watching him Quickly he closes
the album and slips out of the chair

CHARLIE
Can I go out now

Grandmother opens the watch that she wears around her neck

HELEN RANDOLPH
Two hours Thats all Anything

wearing a gold chain around her neck --- and this one is
attached to the gold key

CHARLIE
Whats that key for

HELEN RANDOLPH

CHARLIE
Whats that key around your neck
Grandmother Mrs Randolph sir

She hesitates then walks towards him

HELEN RANDOLPH
This key is for a cage and the cage
contains a tiger and the tiger

Frightened Charlie runs out of the room Grandmother touches

the key

INT ELIZABETHS BEDROOM - NIGHT

A few days later Charlie comes into his mothers bedroom as

father was in the hospital Now I
just feel tired

CHARLIE

ELIZABETH
(smiles)

CHARLIE
Some pictures are missing from

Charlie watches Theresa come out with a silver bowl ona
tray

HELEN RANDOLPH
Have you ever been to India Mr
Stone

MR STONE

HELEN RANDOLPH
The silver bowl was a gift from the
Maharaja of Jamnagor My husband

CHARLIE
You hunted tigers

Charlie expects to be reprimanded but Grandmother smiles

HELEN RANDOLPH
I did a great many things when I

house

There are dozens of chairs and tables A harpsichord An old

CHARLIE

walks toward a light at the end of the room The wailing gets
louder and louder He steps around a couch and sees --

A MAN

sitting with his back to us He looks down at a bare light
bulb while he plays a tenor saxophone The wailing sound is
just Ornette Coleman style modern jazz

CHARLIE

takes one step forward brushes against a packing box and a
stack of old jazz records clatter onto the floor

knows it

HELEN RANDOLPH
Theres no place to put him

CHARLIE
What about that little house The
gardeners house

HELEN RANDOLPH
Your uncle was the one who
destroyed it

ELIZABETH
Then he should be the one to fix it
up He was the only person in this
family who could use a hammer

A Beat as Helen stares at them

HELEN RANDOLPH
As you wish

Helen sweeps out of the room with as much dignity as
possible Aunt Julia collapses in a chair

AUNT JULIA
Oh God I need a drink

Theresa walks over to the sideboard She picks up a decanter
and pours a glass of whiskey

THERESA
You know if a snake bit your
mother
(drinks the whiskey)
That snake would die

INT CHARLIES BEDROOM - DAY

The following morning Charlie wakes up to the sound of
hammering He rolls out of bed and peers out the window

THE GARDENERS COTTAGE

Nathan is repairing the damaged gardeners house while
Elizabeth talks to her brother

Nathan rips off a sheet of plywood that covers a smashed-out
window He stops and smiles at his sister Elizabeth hugs
him then walks back to the main house

EXT THE GARDENERS COTTAGE - DAY

An hour later Hiding behind some shrubbery he watches his
uncle nail some loose boards back onto the small porch

Nathan wears a sleeveless T-shirt and we can see a small rose
tattoo on his shoulder A portable radio is playing Gene
Chandlers hit Duke of Earl

NATHAN
You want to help
(no response)

I could use some help Charlie

Charlie slowly approaches his uncle

CHARLIE
Howd you know I was there

NATHAN
People have been watching me for
the last three years I expect it

He hands Charlie the hammer
NATHAN

Here You get the loose boards Im
going to work on the windows

Nathan picks up a tape measure and walks over to a window
Charlie finds a nail and cautiously tries to tap it into the
wood

NATHAN
Thanks for getting me out of the
basement I was starting to forget
how the sky looks in the morning

CHARLIE
Were you bad

NATHAN
What do you mean

CHARLIE
Was that why they locked you in the
basement Because you were bad

NATHAN
I was kind of messed up Confused
You know how you feel when you spin
round and round I felt that way
all the time

CHARLIE
(tentative)
But youre better

NATHAN
Im out Thats all I know Im out
and I dont want to go back
(glances at Charlie)
Got to teach my nephew how to use a
hammer

Challenged Charlie swings the hammer hard and --
LONG SHOT - THE GARDENERS COTTAGE

We hear the boys YOWL of pain as he hits his thumb

INT COTTAGE - DAY

We hear a SAXOPHONE SOLO -- something improvised and happy --
as Nathan shows Charlie how to swing the hammer with his
entire arm (not just the wrist)

A FEW DAYS LATER

Charlie rewires a ceiling lamp WIDEN ANGLE and see that
Nathan is holding him up in the air while he gives
directions

A FEW DAYS LATER

Charlie and Nathan work together on a water pipe The boy
holds a pipe with a wrench while Nathan uses some pliers

A FEW DAYS LATER

We see Nathan sitting against the wall of the cottage Hes
playing the saxophone (the same solo weve heard for the last
ten seconds)

Charlie is hammering a nail the right way -- using his arm
He glances over at his uncle Nathan nods his approval and
continues to play

INT MR STONES CADILLAC - DAY

A few days later Mr Stone drives Elizabeth and Charlie to
his house Elizabeth wears a tennis dress Charlie sits in
the back seat and watches his mother smile at this stranger

MR STONE
I have lights on my court for
playing at night but they stopped
working two weeks ago Its
impossible to get a repair man
during the summer

CHARLIE
I could fix it

MR STONE
I beg your pardon

CHARLIE
Im learning how to fix everything
Plumbing electrical

ELIZABETH
Charlie has been helping his Uncle
Nathan fix up the cottage

MR STONE
This is a mans job Charlie Its
not for little boys

EXT STONES HOUSE - THE TENNIS COURT - DAY

Elizabeth and Mr Stone play tennis on his private court
Charlie sits on a bench reading a Plastic Man comic book

In the background we can see Stones New England style
house Theres a large front porch and gables on the roof

Stone hits the ball Elizabeth runs to the side and misses
She lowers her racket and laughs

ELIZABETH
I dont think Im much of an
opponent for you

MR STONE
No Youre a great playerfor a
woman

CHARLIE

Im thirsty

ELIZABETH
Is there any water Lawrence

MR STONE
Go to the kitchen Charlie
INT STONES HOUSE - THE KITCHEN - DAY

A minute later Stones kitchen is extremely neat There are
glass cupboards and a checkerboard floor

Charlie stands on a chair and fills up a glass at the sink
He drinks the water puts the glass on the counter then
pushes the chair back under the kitchen table

Charlie starts to walk out the back door then hears a PLINK
CLOSE-UP - THE FAUCET

Water is dripping out of the sink faucet

CHARLIE

looks around the room and sees a toolbox near the back door

He hesitates -- should he fix the faucet -- then decides
against the idea and opens the back door

PLINK Another drop falls into the sink Charlie stops and
closes the door He remembers watching Nathan fix a faucet
Well he didnt see the whole procedure but most of it
Charlie rolls up his sleeves picks up a gigantic pipe wrench
and walks towards the sink

EXT THE TENNIS COURT —- DAY

Elizabeth and Mr Stone exchange another series of shots
then she hits it out-of-bounds

MR STONE
Out

ELIZABETH
Only by a few inches

Elizabeth looks back at the house

ELIZABETH
Charlies taking an awfully long
time

MR STONE

He probably decided to stay inside
where its cooler

(tosses her a ball)
Come on Its your serve

INT THE KITCHEN —- DAY

Standing on a chair Charlie tries to unscrew the handle on
the dripping faucet

The boy pushes hard but the pipe wrench slips off the
handle He tightens it up tries again and the handle begins
to turn the right way

Charlie pries off the handle and water starts to spurt out of
the open pipe

He grabs a towel and tries to stop the flow The water
squirts all over the kitchen

ANGLE - UNDER THE SINK
Charlie yanks open the little doors under the sink and starts

to push away cans of cleanser Water is splashing all over
the kitchen and theres no way to stop it

Charlie sees the faucet handles that regulate water flow and
realizes that he should have turned them off first He tries
to turn the cold water faucet but its rusted shut

Charlie takes the wrench and tries to turn off the rusted
faucet He presses with all his strength The old copper pipe
cracks open and --

A column of water pushes him across the kitchen

Charlie grabs the wrench and manages to get to his feet Like

an arctic explorer caught in a storm he puts his head down
and trudges forward

EXT MR STONES HOUSE - DAY
Mr Stone and Elizabeth walk towards the house
MR STONE
I think Ive got some iced tea in

the fridge

ELIZABETH
Sounds great

Mr Stone opens the back door and a wall of water surges out
of the kitchen --- carrying Charlie with it

Dead silence The two adults stare at Charlie as he lies on
the grass The wrench is still gripped in his hand

CHARLIE
I fixed your faucet Basically

INT THE DINING ROOM - MORNING

A few days later Charlie sits in the dining room staring at
a place setting that displays every imaginable dish glass
and eating utensil

Grandmother watches the boy intently Shes been trying to
teach him table etiquette

HELEN RANDOLPH
Finger bowl

Thats easy Charlie picks up a small glass bowl

HELEN RANDOLPH
Lobster fork

Charlie reaches for a fork -- no thats a fork for shrimp
cocktail
He touches another fork --- hope thats for escargot

Charlie glances at Grandmother but finds no clues in her
stern expression He decides to risk it and picks up a silver
fork Grandmother nods and Charlie starts breathing again

HELEN RANDOLPH
Say three things of interest to the
person next to you

Charlie turns to the empty chair next to him and pretends to
have a conversation

CHARLIE
AhhhIsnt this a great dinner

HELEN RANDOLPH
Unimaginative

CHARLIE
Think its going to rain tomorrow

HELEN RANDOLPH
Very unimaginative Discussions
about the weather are for shop-
keepers and train conductors

Charlie is sweating He feels like a sword is hanging over
his head Think of something Anything He tries again

CHARLIE
You know I once saw our next door
neighbor run over his cat The
whole belly got squeezed open and
you could see the guts and

HELEN RANDOLPH
Thats enough

The door opens and Nathan strolls into the room He wearing
dark slacks a white cotton shirt and a well-cut sports
jacket

Nathan has a definite sense of style Somehow he always
manages to look hip --- like those famous snapshots of John
Coltrane standing outside the Five Spot in New York City

NATHAN
Hey Im sorry to break this up
but I was going to take Charlie
into town to see the historical
museum

HELEN RANDOLPH
I wasnt informed of this

NATHAN
I talked to Lizzy -- its fine with
her The kids got to learn a
little local history

HELEN RANDOLPH
Perhaps

Is Charlie free to go Nathan nods slightly and the boy
scrambles for the door

HELEN RANDOLPH
I expect you back by five oclock

INT ENTRANCE TO THE NEWPORT HISTORICAL MUSEUM — DAY

Newport was founded in 1639 by nine families who hated the
Pilgrims There has always been a conflict between the
wealthy people who live there for most of the year the
tourists and the townies who are trying to make a living

This is 1962 so the town hasnt been totally gentrified by
upscale clothing shops There are some buildings from
colonial times a few working class neighborhoods with white
clapboard houses and -- a small historical museum

Nathan and Charlie walk into the building and an elderly
MUSEUM LADY smiles from behind her desk

MUSEUM LADY
Good morning Welcome to the
Newport Museum

Nathan touches Charlies shoulder and quickly guides him
through the place Theres a whaling exhibit a big map of
the area and lots of paintings of men with Colonial wigs

NATHAN
So Charlie -- you got a good
memory

CHARLIE

Pretty good

NATHAN
Theyre going to ask you about the
museum tonight Say
(quickly)
I liked the whaling exhibit The
harpoon was neat I saw our beach

He guides Charlie back to the entrance The museum lady is
startled by the quick tour

MUSEUM LADY
Anything wrong

NATHAN
Great museum We loved it

CHARLIE
We did Really

And theyre out the door

EXT NEWPORT SIDEWALK —- DAY

Nathan strolls down the sidewalk and Charlie walks beside
him The boy tries to imitate the relaxed and confident way
that Nathan carries himself

They walk past the PINK KITTY MAN a toothless old geezer
who is trying to sell two dozen pink cats wired to a large
sandwich board

NATHAN
You hungry

CHARLIE
Yeah

NATHAN
So what do you do when youre
hungry

CHARLIE

Wait until lunch

NATHAN

They keep walking Charlie skips every few feet to match his
uncles stride

INT THE BLUE BAY DINER —- DAY

Charlie and Nathan sit at the counter in the Blue Bay diner
a chrome and formica place that still makes its own corned
beef hash

The diner is filled with locals and tourists The radio in
the kitchen plays Dion singing Runaround Sue People read
papers with the headline KRUSHCHEV SAYS NYET TO SUMMIT

An OLDER WAITRESS with henna hair approaches them

OLDER WAITRESS
What do you men want

Nathan glances at Charlie

CHARLIE
Mom always orders for me

NATHAN
Well this time youre on your own

He gives Charlie a menu and nods to the waitress

NATHAN
I just want some coffee Come back
in a minute for my friend here

Nathan hears people arguing and spins around on the counter
stool

TWO TOURISTS

sit at a table near the window The MAN wears shorts and a
sun hat His pinched-face WIFE has a voice that could grate
cheese The two of them are arguing with

LAURA BARBIERI a waitress in her late twenties With a few
days rest shed be the most beautiful woman in Newport
Right now she looks tired and frustrated

MALE TOURIST
I definitely ordered the turkey
sandwich -- not the dinner -- and
you charged me for the dinner

LAURA
If you didnt order the dinner
then why did you eat the whole
meal

MALE TOURIST
I didnt realize that until I
finished it Nevertheless Im not
going to pay for something I didnt

order

WIFE
Its the moral principle of the
thing

LAURA

I dont know about moral
principles but I can see that you
ate the whole dinner The corn The
french fries The slice of apple
pie

MALE TOURIST
Are you deaf or are you stupid I
told you

NATHAN
How much is the tab

They all turn around and find Nathan standing by the table

MALE TOURIST
Who the hell are you

NATHAN
Whats the tab Lets have it

A little intimidated the wife glances at the check

WIFE
855

Nathan tosses a ten dollar hill on the table
NATHAN
You just got a free meal Now get
the hell out of here

Grumbling to each other the two tourists walk out Laura is
annoyed She follows Nathan halfway across the diner

LAURA
I could have handled that

NATHAN
Im sure thats true

LAURA
I can take care of myself

NATHAN
No argument

Nathan looks around the diner -- everyone is staring at them
He definitely does not want to get into trouble

NATHAN
Come on Charlie Lets get out of
here

EXT OUTSIDE THE DINER - DAY
Nathan and Charlie walk out of the diner

NATHAN
Im sorry about that Theres a
hotdog stand on the next block

They stroll down the sidewalk Charlie glances at his uncle

CHARLIE
Uncle Nathan

NATHAN
Yeah

CHARLIE
If you get into trouble will they
send you back to the basement

NATHAN
Or some place worse

CHARLIE
Can I go with you

Surprised Nathan glances at his nephew This is the first
time he realizes how much Charlie cares about him

For a moment Nathans face shows tension and pain -- we
realize what hes been through Then he smiles and
everythings all right

NATHAN
Were not going to the basement
Were going to get some hot dogs
then Ill teach you how to play
pool

They smile at each other and we --

CUT TO

EXT THE LUCKY SPOT POOL AND BILLIARDS HALL - DAY

Finishing their hot dogs Nathan and Charlie walk down the
sidewalk to The Lucky Spot The cinder block pool hall has
the proud distinction of being the ugliest building in town

Nathan opens the door and Charlie sees a prominent sign that
reads NO MINORS ALLOWED

CHARLIE
Whats a minor

NATHAN
Someone who digs coal

INT THE LUCKY SPOT —- DAY

The Lucky Spot is a dump but the pool tables are kept in
immaculate condition There are no windows so you cant tell
if its night or day outside The Tokens sing The Lion
Sleeps Tonight on the radio

TOMMY LEONG an middle-aged Chinese man who smokes three
packs of cigarettes a day sits behind a counter built two
feet off the floor Hes surprised when he sees Nathan then
smiles broadly

TOMMY
Nathan Good to see you Its been
a long time

NATHAN
How you doing Tommy
(looks around)
The place hasnt changed much

TOMMY
They wanted to buy me out Put in
another goddamn souvenir shop I
told them to get screwed

NATHAN
You still got a couple of private
cues I never could use that warped
stuff in the racks

TOMMY
For you -- sure

He reaches under the counter and comes up with two custom-
made pool cues Nathan takes the cues and walks over to a
pool table

TOMMY
Whos the boy

NATHAN
My nephew Were taking a tour of
the historical sites

Nathan switches on the light over the table and racks the
balls Its obvious that he knows what hes doing

CHARLIE
I dont know how to play pool
Uncle Nathan
NATHAN
No problem Now youre going to
learn
He holds a pool cue and Charlie tries to imitate him
NATHAN
Hold the cue like this Your
fingers are like a bridge Relax
Just relax You look great
We hear The Lion Sleeps Tonight which continues as we
CUT TO
A FEW MINUTES LATER

Charlie tries to hit the cue ball --- and misses completely
He glances up at Nathan who gives him an encouraging smile

A HALF HOUR LATER

Charlie hits the cue ball so hard that it bounces off the
table Tommy Leong lights another cigarette and shakes his
head --- this kid is terrible

ONE HOUR LATER

Charlie makes a great shot and the ball goes in He throws
his arms up in the air

LATE IN THE AFTERNOON

Charlie is drinking a bottle of root beer and circling the
pool table He sinks a ball then chalks the cue Nathan is
amused One lesson and the kids acting like a pro

CHARLIE
So what do you say we play for a
little money Penny a ball

NATHAN
Quick -- whats at the museum

CHARLIE

They hear laughter and see three beefy young men swagger into
the room GREG JOEY and RAYMOND have already finished off
two six-packs and are feeling no pain

RAYMOND

The blond-haired Greg walks over to the table

He touches Nathans shoulder
GREG

Nathan pushes Gregs hand away

NATHAN
You know what I do remember you I

easy

Greg sucker punches Nathan in the stomach then throws a
quick uppercut that brings Nathan to his knees

Charlie looks horrified
Greg grins at his friends
GREG

looney

Nathan stands up and touches his mouth Hes bleeding
Fighting to control his anger he faces Greg

NATHAN
You satisfied

GREG

Greg attacks Nathan again -- punching him in the neck chest
and face Again Nathan goes down Triumphant Greg stands
over him

GREG
This is great Youre making my day

Nathan lurches to his feet

GREG
I think I want you to kiss my
shoes What do you think guys

RAYMOND
Sounds good to me

Greg swings his right fist but Nathan blocks the blow and
counterpunches hard

Attacking savagely Nathan drives Greg across the poolroom
and WHAM -- slams him against the wail Pool cues fall out
of the rack and hit the floor

RAYMOND AND JOEY

hear a SLAMMING sound They look over at the desk Tommy
Leong stands up with a baseball bat in his hands

NATHAN

has his right hand around Gregs neck He leans forward and
whispers

NATHAN

all your teeth -- then stay away

He lets go and Greg slumps to floor Nathan motions to
Charlie and walks out

TOMMY
Come back later When I sweep out
the garbage

EXT NEWPORT PUBLIC BEACH —- DAY

A few minutes later Charlie and Nathan walk down the asphalt
sidewalk at the edge of the citys only public beach

CHARLIE
You all right Uncle Nathan

NATHAN
Im okay

CHARLIE
Why did he want to hurt you

NATHAN
Sometimes when you feel small
inside you want to make someone
else feel smaller

A SIREN wails for a few seconds then goes silent Charlie
and Nathan turn around as a police car approaches them

Charlie is terrified Nathan touches the boy lightly on the
shoulder

CHARLIE
Are they going to arrest us

NATHAN
Take a deep breath Charlie Dont
let them know youre scared

CHARLIE
I cant be arrested Im supposed
to go to the fourth grade

The police car stops and two officers get out SHERIFF LEON
McKAY is a scrawny looking cop with jug ears His deputy
TERRY CLARK is a big slow-moving man

NATHAN
Good afternoon Sheriff McKay
Deputy Clark

SHERIFF MCKAY
Youre in trouble Nathan Definite

Terrified Charlie clutches his uncles hand McKay steps
toward Nathan

SHERIFF MCKAY
As far as Im concerned you should

Hospital You screw up one more
time and I wont care whose fault
it is youre going back there --
forever

McKay turns around and swaggers back to the patrol car
Deputy Clark follows him

DEPUTY CLARK
I thought we were gonna cuff him
EXT NEWPORT PUBLIC BEACH - DAY

A few minutes later Nathan and Charlie continue down the
sidewalk

CHARLIE
Why doesnt he like you

NATHAN
I remember Leon McKay when he
wasnt a sheriff We both owned
motorcycles when people ran races
on the back roads around here

Nathan smiles and shakes his head

NATHAN
I always beat him Maybe I should
have let him win a few times

CHARLIE
Why did he arrest you

NATHAN
One night things got real confused
in my head I rode into town on my
motorcycle and smashed it up Got
in a fight with Leon and broke his
jaw Thats when I got arrested and
sent to the hospital

CHARLIE
Is that your motorcycle in the
barn

NATHAN

CHARLIE

Theres a smashed-up motorcycle in

NATHAN
Now thats a genuine miracle I
thought they threw it away
Nathan stops and leans against the railing
NATHAN
There are miracles all around us
Charlie
He looks across the beach at --

LAURA BARBIERI

standing at the edge of the water Laura is wearing a white
summer dress She looks beautiful --- and a little sad
NATHAN
smiles at his nephew

NATHAN
Sometimes they just walk into our
lives

Nathan steps onto the beach Charlie tags after him

CHARLIE

NATHAN
I think so

CHARLIE
What are you going to say

NATHAN
Im not sure

CHARLIE
Girls are weird

NATHAN
Men are even weirder

CHARLIE

listen

ANGLE - LAURA
She stares out at the Atlantic

NATHAN
Id like to apologize

She turns and sees Nathan

NATHAN

Laura stops hesitates and smiles

NATHAN
Youre pretty smooth Charlie
Maybe you should give me lessons
INT CHARLIES BEDROOM - NIGHT
Charlie kneels down on the floor to feed his hamster The
wire door is open Godzilla has escaped
INT UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Searching for the hamster Charlie wanders down the shadowy
hallway He whispers

CHARLIE
Godzilla

CLOSE-UP - THE HAMSTER

Godzilla is standing in the hallway He sees Charlie coming
and scurries through a crack in a three-foot high sliding
panel (this is built into the wall)

A FEW SECONDS LATER

Charlie pushes open the panel Godzilla is standing inside an
old dumbwaiter that runs from the kitchen to the first floor

Charlie crawls into the three-foot high dumbwaiter and grabs
the hamster

CHARLIE
Whyd you run away Huh Whyd you
run away
ANGLE - INSIDE THE DUMBWAITER

Charlie looks around him He sees a small brass lever
touches it and

ANGLE - INSIDE THE DUMBWAITER SHAFT

Charlie screams as the dumbwaiter zooms down the shaft like a
runaway elevator

INT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Theres a clunking sound when the elevator reaches the end of
the steel cable

INSIDE THE DUMBWAITER

Charlie looks stunned He starts to open the grated door to
the kitchen then hears VOICES

UNCLE RODGER AND LAWRENCE STONE
enter the kitchen together

Stone watches Rodger manipulate the padlock on a latched
cabinet

UNCLE RODGER
Helen restricts me to one Scotch
and soda before dinner but
sometimes I sneak a little extra

MR STONE
And what she doesnt know

UNCLE RODGER

Startled Rodger looks at Stone

UNCLE RODGER
What the hell are you talking

MR STONE

Your bomb shelter business is about

Rodger pours himself a glass of scotch

UNCLE RODGER
We have a cash-flow problem Thats
all

MR STONE
Maybe I can help you out I used to
work for a brokerage firm that
handled the Randolph account
Helens husband was trading heavily
in the stock market before he died

UNCLE RODGER
Right Thats how he lost all the
money He must have sold the stock
for a big loss -- because there was
almost nothing left in the trust

MR STONE
He never sold his stock at all

Rodger gulps some Scotch

UNCLE RODGER
What

MR STONE
I bet theres a fortune in stock
certificates somewhere in this
house We just have to find them

Scotch

UNCLE RODGER

INSIDE THE DUMBWAITER
Charlie watches the two men leave the kitchen

MR STONE
Come on Rodger Lets take a
little walk down to the beach

A FEW SECONDS LATER

Charlie opens the grated door He sits in the dumbwaiter
holding Godzilla

EXT NEWPORT BEACH — DAY

The next day Charlie watches Nathan practice his saxophone
on the beach at dawn

Nathan prefers the post-bebop cool jazz that was popular
before he went to prison He plays with a tinge of sadness
It sounds somewhat like Miles Davis Kind of Blue album

EXT NEWPORT STREETS - DAY

An hour later they walk home through a working class
neighborhood in the town of Newport Large maple trees shade
white clapboard houses with bay windows and front porches

CHARLIE
Whats a stock certificate

NATHAN
Its a piece of paper It says that
you own part of a company

CHARLIE
I heard Uncle Rodger and Mr Stone
talking about certificates Mr
Stone said maybe some were hidden
in the house

NATHAN
Did you tell your mom about this

CHARLIE
No Just you

NATHAN
Maybe I should discuss this with
Helen

CHARLIE

You mean grandmother Youd really
talk to her

NATHAN
Anythings possible Charlie

Nathan looks down the street and sees

LAURA BARBIERI

store One of the paper bags has split open and cans are

rolling across the sidewalk

NATHAN (0S)

INT JOHNNY BARBIERIS ROOM - DAY

Lauras father JOHNNY BARBIERI lies on a bed with his eyes
closed One IV tube leads into his body Another tube leads
out to a bottle on the floor

The old man has pale skin and a prominent nose He looks like
the wax effigy of a saint carried through the streets on a
feast day Charlie stares at him -- fascinated

CHARLIE
Can he hear us

LAURA
I think he can hear everything i
think his mind is still perfect

She sits down next to her father and touches his head

LAURA
Sometimes I sit next to him and
feel these thoughts going through
his brain It must be terrible when
you cant express what you feel

NATHAN
Hes lucky to have you here

Laura stands and begins to straighten up the room Theres a
hint of bitterness in her voice

LAURA
So -- this wasnt what you were
expecting Was it I guess you
figured that I was unattached No
complications The perfect summer
romance

NATHAN
I dont expect anything these days
Laura But I try not to judge
people before I know who they are

LAURA
(embarrassed )
Im sorry Would you like some
coffee

NATHAN
Sounds good
(walks out of room)
Come on Charlie

Nathan and Laura leave the room but Charlie continues to
stare at Lauras father

Charlie walks over to the old man A BEAT then he reaches
out and touches his cheek Johnnys eyes snap open and stare
at Charlie Startled the boy runs out of the room

INT LAURAS KITCHEN - DAY

We hear Buck Clayton playing his version of All The Cats
Join In as Charlie Nathan and Laura sit at the kitchen
table

Nathan says something and Laura laughs Charlie munches on a
doughnut and no one warns him about the crumbs

EXT NEWPORT STREETS - DAY

THE MUSIC CONTINUES as Charlie and Nathan escort Laura to her
job at the diner

Nathan is polite around Laura --- almost graceful Charlie
watches his uncle speak to this beautiful woman
INT RANDOLPH MANSION - LIBRARY - NIGHT

Its raining and you can hear THUNDER in the distance
Charlie is alone in the library

He stacks up a pile of books next to a 1940s RCA Victor
phonograph

The phonograph is a large expensive model that looks like a
wooden cabinet

Picking up a 78 record Charlie stands on the pile and leans
over the phonograph He puts the record on the turntable
then places the needle down Instantly All The Cats Join
In booms out of the speaker

Charlie gets down from the stack of hooks Dozens of jazz and
swing records are on the floor

Suddenly Charlie hears the chiming sound of the front
doorbell

INT FRONT HALLWAY —- NIGHT

Nearing a dressing gown Helen walks down the hallway to the
front door She opens the door and finds Nathan standing in
the rain

NATHAN
Mind if I come in Id like to talk
to you for a minute

HELEN RANDOLPH
Try not to drip

Nathan steps inside and faces his mother Their shadows move
against the wall

ANGLE - CHARLIE

Charlie walks softly down the hallway He hides behind an
umbrella stand and listens to the conversation

ANGLE - NATHAN AND HELEN

NATHAN
Its about Charlie He told me that
he overhead a conversation between
Rodger and Lawrence Stone It was
all a little confusing to him but
apparently Dad might have hidden
some stock certificates in the
house before he died

HELEN RANDOLPH
Nothing your father bought was ever
worth anything
NATHAN
Perhaps I could check it out
myself

HELEN RANDOLPH
Your father lost almost everything
we had

NATHAN
Are you sure thats true

HELEN RANDOLPH
Youve never shown any interest in
this family Nathan You were
always running down to New York to
play your music

NATHAN
If thats how you see it then
theres not much I can say

Nathan walks back to the door

HELEN RANDOLPH
Frankly I think that Charlie has
been spending too much time with
you these days Rodger is going up
to the Adirondacks on a hunting
trip Ive asked him to take
Charlie along

NATHAN
Rodgers a jerk and you know it

HELEN RANDOLPH
Hes been unwise in his
investments but hes -- stable

NATHAN
You mean hes never been arrested
and sent to a mental hospital Like
me

HELEN RANDOLPH
Correct

NATHAN
Charlies a nice kid I dont want
him to get messed up by this
family

HELEN RANDOLPH
Thats not my intention

NATHAN
There was always too much past
around here Too much tradition
The past makes you feel heavy It
weighs you down like extra gravity

HELEN RANDOLPH
Perhaps you werent strong enough
to meet your responsibilities

NATHAN
Music was always different It made
me feel lighter Like I could fly

He walks out Grandmother locks the door and turns around
She hears footsteps as Charlie scurries back down the
hallway

INT LIBRARY - NIGHT

Charlie sits in a club chair as Take the A Train plays on
the phonograph The door creaks open and Helen marches in

HELEN RANDOLPH
Were you listening to us

CHARLIE
Excuse me

HELEN RANDOLPH
Dont lie Charlie I hate liars

Helen walks over to the phonograph The needle makes a
scratching sound as she pulls up the phonograph arm

HELEN RANDOLPH
Your grandfather used to sit here
for hours staring at this
phonograph and listening to music
At first I thought it was
charming Now I realize that it
was a gigantic waste of time

She turns and faces her grandson

HELEN RANDOLPH
Youve been spending a great deal
of time with Nathan havent you
Ive been against it but your
mother has not shared my concerns

Charlie can hear the grumble of the distant thunder He sits
up in the chair and tries to confront this formidable woman

CHARLIE
I like Uncle Nathan

HELEN RANDOLPH
He can be very charming Just like
his father When I was a young
woman I was easily swayed by such
qualities

She moves around the room inspecting the framed photographs
of her dead relatives

HELEN RANDOLPH
Then my husband died and I
discovered that he had lost more
than half of our savings By my own
effort Ive kept this house from
being sold but Im not impressed
by charm anymore

CHARLIE
I like him anyway

Grandmother moves towards Charlie

HELEN RANDOLPH
Are you scared of me Charlie Go
on You can tell the truth

CHARLIE
A little

HELEN RANDOLPH
Im trying to teach you
responsibility and discipline You
have to learn or youll end up like
me Someone who was fooled by
charm

forehead

STEVE
