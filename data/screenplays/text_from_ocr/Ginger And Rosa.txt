coming from a radio in Natalie’s bedroom

The Defence Department of the
United States government has
arrived at estimates of casualties

and the Soviet Union

NATALIE (0S)
It’s depressing Turn it off

talk

NATALIE
I think Rosa is a bad influence

ROLAND

Ginger suddenly steps forward into the open doorway
GINGER

(hotly)

Ginger how to flirt and

kiss with a boy

Close your eyes Turn your head

Opposite way

awkwardly at each other before

Ginger collapses into laughter Then in a change of mood

they start a traditional girls’ clapping sequence which

gets faster and faster

excitement

their eyes shining with effort and

EXT WASTEGROUND - EVENING 10

Rosa and Ginger are hanging out on a patch of wasteground
near a corrugated iron fence The rusty skeleton of a gas-
works looms above them It’s a scene of urban decay and

destruction in the post-war years

Rosa pulls two cigarettes out of a packet and puts them
both in her mouth Ginger strikes a match and lights them
for her Rosa hands one of them to Ginger Ginger takes a

puff but coughs and splutters and pulls a face of disgust

ROSA
Youre not doing it right Here

Ginger takes a drag and coughs again Rosa laughs wildly

EXT LONDON ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 11

Ginger and Rosa are standing by a wall necking with two
long-haired young beatniks in a dark alleyway in London
just out of sight of a noisy pub Ginger seems shy and
tentative but Rosa eventually lies down in the shadows on
the ground with the other boy and seems to be about to have

uncomfortable-looking sex

Ginger is trying to see what Rosa is doing Rosa looks up

at Ginger and their eyes meet Rosa’s eyes are shining

And then the two girls are on their feet running away
hand in hand They turn back to wave enthusiastically at
the two beatniks who are shuffling off together in the
opposite direction

INT HALLWAY AND LIVING ROOM (NATALIE’S HOUSE) - NIGHT 12

Ginger and Rosa creep along the hallway past the open
living-room door where Natalie is sitting by the fire in
her night-clothes Roland is working at a desk at the other
end of the room The room is stark and barely furnished
some books and canvases stacked against the wall

Natalie looks up sees the girls and stands up angrily
NATALIE
Where the hell have you been

GINGER
We were just you know roving

about Being free

Ginger giggles and slides down to
smiles to himself as he continues

NATALIE
It’s two in the morning

ROLAND

Yes Well it is late Indeed

Ginger turns to Roland

GINGER
You always stay up late

Ginger and Rosa glance at each other giggling

conspiratorially Natalie looks at Rosa

NATALIE
Anoushka must be crazed with worry

ROSA
Doubtful

NATALIE

Rosa

Roland stops working reluctantly and looks up at the

girls

ROLAND
I suppose I’d better

Oh come on
Rosa Jesus I

Ginger jumps up excitedly and the girls skip out of the
door smiling happily Ginger glances back momentarily and

catches Natalie’s sad expression

EXT LONDON STREETS AND TUNNEL —- NIGHT 13

The two girls sit side by side in the back seat of an old
army jeep as Roland drives scarily fast the tyres

screeching as they hurtle round corners

He takes the girls on a joy-ride through a long echoing
tunnel revelling in their laughter in the cold night air

as their long hair blows around their faces

Roland grins delightedly and then accelerates as he watches
the girls’ excited reactions in the rear-view mirror His

eyes briefly meet Rosa’s and she smiles shyly

Eventually the jeep squeals to a halt outside the tenement
buildings Rosa jumps out of the jeep and starts to walk

away jauntily

GINGER
Tomorrow

Rosa is caught in the jeep’s headlights as she turns back

to Ginger

ROSA
Today actually

GINGER
Good point

ROSA
Bye Ginger’s dad

Roland frowns and peers out at her

ROLAND
(pointedly)
It’s Roland Actually

Rosa smiles wickedly
14 INT BATHROOM (NATALIE’S HOUSE) - DAY

Ginger and Rosa lie at either end of the bathtub in the
draughty bathroom They are wearing bras and reading girls’

comics Girl and Valentine

ROSA
It says here that a girls most
important possession is a bubbly

personality

GINGER

Interesting

Ginger pauses thoughtfully and lowers her comic to look at

Rosa

GINGER (CONT’D)
Do you think Simone de Beauvoir has

a bubbly personality

ROSA
Who

Ginger covers her face with the comic

GINGER
(casually)
Oh that French writer She’s an

existentialist

ROSA
Maybe she hasn’t read “Girl” It
says here that boys don’t like
girls who are too serious

GINGER
Oh

They sit quietly in the water as Ginger considers the

implications of Rosa’s comment

GINGER (CONTD)
Well even so did I tell you Ive
decided to be a poet

ROSA
I thought you were already
Do you think they’ve shrunk enough
yet

They grip the sides of the bath and stand up with
difficulty in the water revealing sodden jeans clinging
to their legs Rosa starts to unbutton her jeans Blue dye
has seeped from her jeans onto her stomach The two girls

start giggling hysterically

The door bursts open It’s Roland He stares briefly at the

two girls as Rosa looks at him insolently

ROLAND

Sorry

Roland grins and then slams the door again

EXTINT COASTAL ROAD AND CAR - DAY 15

Ginger and Rosa are standing side-by-side on a country road
wearing their identical tight jeans and dufflecoats They
are hitchhiking A car screeches to a halt the car radio
blaring out ‘Apache’ by The Shadows The young DRIVER and
his FRIEND are both wearing full teddy-boy regalia

The girls run to the car and jump into the back seat They
look at each other with expressions of fear and excitement
as the car screeches and veers round the bends in the
wintry costal road near a forest of electricity pylons The
driver laughs maniacally as the girls scream and then
drives even faster When the car nearly goes off the road

he suddenly brakes

Ginger grasps the door handle as the car squeals to a halt
and the girls tumble out and run off across the shingle

between the pylons

EXT BEACH —- DAY 16

Ginger and Rosa are walking along a huge deserted beach

their arms around each others’ shoulders

GINGER

I’ve been thinking

ROSA

Unusual

GINGER

Very funny Listen

ROSA

I’m listening

GINGER
Id prefer the world not to end

wouldn’t you

ROSA
Probably If I find true love

The two girls sit down side-by-side on the end of a long

wooden board-walk

ROSA (CONTD)
You know The kind that lasts

forever If
She pauses with a worried expression

GINGER AND ROSA
(simultaneously)

if there is a forever

They look at each other

GINGER AND ROSA (CONT’D)
(simultaneously)

Good point

Rosa and Ginger smile at each other pleased at their
complicity then both turn and sit looking gloomily out to

sea

GINGER
But really RosaI think we should
do something About the bomb You

know protest
Rosa pauses before answering

ROSA
I think we should pray

She hesitates briefly then pulls out two lurid pink
plastic crucifixes She hands one of them shyly to

Ginger

GINGER
Ohgoshthank you

This has come as a surprise Ginger turns the crucifix

over awkwardly in her palm

INT CHURCH - DAY

Ginger and Rosa sit side-by-side in a pew in a huge
echoing gloomy church fingering the identical pink

crucifixes which are now hanging round their necks

Rosa is gazing at the billowing incense being swung

rhythmically back and forth by the priest
Ginger looks puzzled

But Rosa looks increasingly rapturous

EXT BEACH SHELTER - DUSK

Rosa and Ginger are sitting huddled on a bench in a double-
sided shelter by the windswept beach A young tousle-haired
beatnik approaches and offers a cigarette to Rosa She
glances at Ginger then gets up and moves along the bench

to sit next to him

After a while Rosa and the boy walk round to the other side
of the shelter and start necking their figures just

visible through the scratched and misty glass

Ginger reaches down and opens her duffle-bag then sits
perched on the bench reading intently and pointedly to

herself from a battered edition of TS Eliots poems

sleepily as the lorry rumbles through the night

INT NATALIE’S KITCHEN — DAY 21

Ginger is carefully ironing Rosa’s hair on an ironing
board The iron goes dangerously close to Rosa’s head and

Rosa’s hair with her fingers

INT GINGER’S BEDROOM —- DAY 22

Rosa lies on Ginger’s bed as Ginger puts a record on her
record player It’s “Take Five” played by Dave Brubeck

GINGER

Rosa

After a moment Rosa reappears with one of Natalie’s
blouses She pulls it tightly round her body admiring

herself in the mirror

GINGER (CONT’D)

Isn’t that mum’s

ROSA

So

Ginger stares at Rosa puzzled then flops down on the bed
as Rosa preens and poses gazing at her reflection
Eventually Rosa shrugs and throws off the blouse The two
girls change into their identical sloppy sweaters once more
and stare at themselves in the mirror before smiling at

each other happily

INT NATALIE’S KITCHEN —- NIGHT

Ginger and Rosa appear at the door of the kitchen They are
wearing their dufflecoats on top of their identical

sweaters

Natalie is sitting at the kitchen table with her friend
MARK and Anoushka They are each clasping a mug of tea and
seem to be in the middle of a hushed intimate

conversation which stops abruptly as the girls appear

ANOUSHKA

Where are you two going

GINGER

To a meeting

MARK
What kind of meeting

GINGER
A meeting to ban the bomb It’s
called the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament YCND

NATALIE
What’s the Y for

GINGER AND ROSA
(simultaneously)

Young

MARK
Well Good for you two girls
That’s marvellous Don’t you think
so Nat

NATALIE
Roland would be pleased

ANOUSHKA
Just don’t get home too late Rosa
Youve got to help me with the

little ones -

ROSA
- I haven’t got to do anything

ANOUSHKA
(angrily)
God if there was a man around -

ROSA
- youd be lucky -

ANOUSHKA
(furious)
Rosa

Natalie glances at Anoushka

NATALIE

Speaking of which when was the
last time you did any washing up

Ginger

GINGER
But I’ve hardly been here for any

meals

NATALIE
Well exactly Where have you been
I had a letter from your school It
was embarrassing

GINGER
(sarcastically)
Embarrassing How terrible
(MORE)

GINGER (CONTD)
Especially given that the world
might blow up which none of you

seem to understand

MARK
(gently)
Are you quite sure about that
darling

GINGER
Oh Mark I didn’t mean you

Mark smiles fondly at Ginger

INT CHURCH HALL - NIGHT

Ginger and Rosa are sitting in the back row at the meeting

being held in a bleak church hall The meeting is sparsely

populated A young intense bearded man TONY
at the front talking to the group

TONY
The question is what to do Or as
Engels puts it “What is to be
done” Nuclear weapons do not
protect us They threaten our very
existence The missiles on bases
here in Britain are hundreds of
times more powerful than those used
in Hiroshima We have to take
direct action We must do
everything we can to stop this

madness

is standing

Rosa glances at Ginger who is listening intently

YOUNG MAN
The government can’t ignore it if
there are enough people on the

streets

TONY
So how do we get people out How do
we get people out of their homes

and marching with us

Tony pauses and scans the hall then points at Ginger and

Rosa

TONY (CONTD)
You back there Well girls I

haven’t seen you here before What

do you say Do you think the

politicians will listen to us

Rosa looks down hiding behind her hair Ginger looks

tongue-tied and embarrassed

25 INT GINGER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ginger lies in bed writing in a small notebook A large

‘Ban the Bomb’ sign hangs on the wall behind her

GINGER
(murmuring to herself)
In my dream I heard the warning

You have three minutes left it

said

Tell the otherstell the others

now

Ginger stops writing and listens to Natalie and Roland who

are just audible arguing somewhere downstairs in the

house

NATALIE (0S)

How could I not suspect something

You’re never here

ROLAND (0S)

I’m here now

Roland’s voice is low and measured and all
terrible for it Ginger continues writing

stay focussed

GINGER
Tell the others now this

morning

the more

attempting to

ROLAND (0S)
For God’s sake Natalie That’s

enough

NATALIE (0S)

Don’t tell me what’s enough

ROLAND (0S)
(shouting)
Oh God Natalie

A door slams violently Ginger pauses then continues

writing searching for the words

GINGER
(murmuring to herself)
Or you soonOr you soon will all

be dead

Ginger pauses again then suddenly closes her notebook

puts it down next to her pillow and turns over to face the

wall

INT CAFE - DAY

Roland has taken Ginger out to eat in a traditional pie and

mash cafe

They sit opposite each other at an oil-clothed table as he
tucks into a steak-and-kidney pie and Ginger picks at her

mashed potato

Roland suddenly notices the crucifix hanging round Ginger’s

neck and puts down his fork

ROLAND
What on earth is that crucifix

doing round your neck

GINGER

Rosa and I went to church

ROLAND
Church

GINGER

Once She wanted me to

ROLAND
You do realise that God is an

invention

GINGER
Sort of

ROLAND
Every man needs to struggle for his
own authority Ginger For
autonomous thought Which is why

you mustn’t listen to a word I say
Ginger brightens

GINGER
Well exactly I autonomously
decided to go to church with Rosa

to see what it’s like

Roland laughs affectionately and reaches over to examine

the plastic crucifix more closely

ROLAND
It’s a bit kitsch

GINGER
(quickly)

Rosa gave it to me

ROLAND

Did she now What was it like

GINGER
It was sort of exciting Like going
to the theatre Then we went to a
meeting

Roland pauses

ROLAND
What kind of meeting

GINGER
(proudly)
Ban the Bomb

Roland smiles

ROLAND
That’s my girl You’re an activist

not a supplicant

Ginger glows looking admiringly at her father clearly
flattered by his praise She hesitates then starts to

speak tentatively

GINGER
But don’t you think you know
people need something to believe

about what happens when you die

ROLAND
The concept of life after death is
a superstition designed to keep
people satisfied with their limited
existence in the present The only
life is the one we have now which
is why we must seize it and live
while we have the chance

GINGER
Good point

Roland smiles affectionately at Ginger and then starts
eating again voraciously Ginger picks up her fork and

follows his lead munching her food with relish

INT GINGER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ginger lies alone in bed holding her teddy bears the huge
“Ban The Bomb” sign on the wall above her She is reading
her usual battered copy of poems by TS Eliot but puts
the book down on her chest as she hears the sound of an

accordion playing somewhere downstairs in the house

Ginger closes her book with a little sigh and gets out of
the bed

INT STAIRS AND LIVING ROOM —- NIGHT 28

Ginger creeps down the stairs in the darkness and then sits
down on one of the steps She watches Natalie who is
sitting by the dying embers of a fire in the living room
playing her accordion and singing “The Man I Love” quietly

and mournfully to herself

NATALIE
“Maybe Ill meet him Sunday

Maybe Monday maybe not

Still I’m sure I’ll meet him one
day

Maybe Tuesday will be my good news
day

We’ll build a little home

Just meant for two

From which I’1ll never roam

Who would Would you”

Ginger moves slightly and the stair creaks Natalie stops

playing and looks up

GINGER
(gently)
Where’s Roland

NATALIE
I don’t know I never seem to know

where he is anymore
Ginger stares at her sadly

GINGER

Want a cup of tea Mum
NATALIE
Thank you darling

INT NATALIE’S KITCHEN —- NIGHT 29

Ginger bangs the kettle onto the stove noisily wearily

in the basement kitchen

She lights the gas with a match then turns the knob and

watches the small circle of flames rise and fall

Then she sits on a stool by the stove and listens to the

mournful sound of the accordion in the distance

This looks like it’s happened before

EXT COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

Ginger and Rosa dressed identically are walking side by
side in the “Young CND” contingent of a very long column of

marching protesters

Young mothers push small children in prams Older men with
grizzled beards wearing knitted socks with their leather
sandals march determinedly carrying “Ban the Bomb”
placards Young students march and talk animatedly Its
all very friendly a mix of ages and types united in their
beliefs

TONY (the bearded youth from the meeting) suddenly appears
behind Ginger and playfully gives her a squeeze She
blushes as he smiles at her warmly before joining his
friends at the head of their contingent

The air fills with the distant sound of soaring jazz riffs
coming nearer An open jeep approaches some young male
jazz musicians perched on the back playing their hearts

out

Roland is driving the jeep a YOUNG WOMAN with long blonde

hair by his side

Ginger turns and waves at her father enthusiastically She
Manages to catch his eye and he grins and waves happily

back at her but drives on without slowing down

ROSA
Who’s that with Roland

GINGER
The jazz band

ROSA
No the girl The blonde one

sitting next to him

GINGER
Oh a student or something

Ginger pauses

GINGER (CONT’D)
Mum’s not too happy about it at the
moment

Rosa turns and stares after Roland admiringly fingering
her crucifix

INT MARK’S KITCHEN —- DAY 31

Ginger sits unhappily at a scrubbed table in a very tidy
beautifully-decorated kitchen furnished with an oak
dresser a motley collection of antique chairs a polished
stove and small framed prints on the wall A boiled egg in
an egg cup and some toasted ‘soldiers’ have been placed on
the table in front of her but Ginger sits motionless
staring down at the plate

Mark stands watching Ginger with a kindly expression

MARK
You could consider eating it
Ginger

Mark pauses then sits down next to her at the table

MARK (CONTD)
How is school by the way Or are
you still not bothering with that

very much at the moment

GINGER
Is that why you asked me round Did
Mum ask you to talk to me

MARK
Dont be silly We always love
seeing you And besides I thought
you might like to meet Bella

Mark’s partner who is also called Mark and is known to
their friends as ‘MARK TWO’ lurches into the kitchen
clutching his sides and laughing silently He speaks with

an American accent

MARK TWO
(whispering hysterically)
She asked for dish soap

GINGER
What’s dish soap

MARK
That’s American for washing up

liquid Ginger

MARK TWO
Bella washes her hair with dish

soap

MARK
(in a stage whisper)
That’s because she’s from New York

you see

MARK TWO
Dont listen to him That’s got
nothing to do with it

MARK

I’m teasing I’m teasing

Mark Two kisses Mark lightly on the cheek before hurrying
back out of the kitchen still chuckling

MARK TWO

Coming

Ginger smiles and starts to dip the ‘soldiers’ into the egg
yolk Mark smiles approvingly

MARK

There you are Good girl

EXT HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 32

The two Marks Ginger and BELLA are walking amongst trees
on Hampstead Heath Bella is clutching a bulging heavy-
looking briefcase close to her body

BELLA
So much nature Right in the city
So civilised

MARK TWO
The English need their parks so
that they can get away from each
other It must be the pressure of
being so nice Even the Ban The

Bomb march was polite Bella

Ginger stops in her tracks

GINGER

Were you there too

MARK

Of course we were

GINGER

I didn’t see you

MARK

There were so many people darling

MARK TWO
We were up at the front It was led

by a vicar Ginger A vicar

MARK

A canon actually

BELLA

Oh a vicar with a cannon

They all laugh

MARK
Yes Canon Collins A worthy
Christian A good man actually

despite his beliefs
Ginger suddenly runs ahead and does a cartwheel

MARK (CONTD)

Oh bravo

Ginger walks jauntily amongst this little group looking
suddenly more child-like as she revels in the presence of

their easygoing friendship
Bella drops back and strolls next to Ginger

BELLA
So I gather from your two god-
fathers here that you might be a
militant like me Good for you

Ginger

Ginger smiles shyly but happily and skips along by her

side

INT NATALIE’S KITCHEN —- NIGHT

Ginger and Roland are sitting at the kitchen table It
looks as though an effort has been made Natalie is wearing
a dress and a frilly apron There is an embroidered table-

cloth on the table and the room is candlelit

Natalie turns her back and bends over to reach into the

oven

Roland lifts a candlestick and attempts to read a journal
peering exaggeratedly at the page He glances

conspiratorially at Ginger who smiles back at him

Natalie puts a pie-dish carefully down onto a mat on the
table Roland serves himself and Ginger and starts eating
abstractly
Natalie stands watching him the tension mounting

NATALIE
Cant you thank me Even one word

I made you a pie Your favourite

Roland slowly puts down his fork and sighs He looks
at his plate before replying quietly

ROLAND
Yup I noticed

NATALIE
And

ROLAND
Thanks

There is an icy pause Ginger looks down at her plate

NATALIE
Is that it Is that all you can say

to me

ROLAND
Thank you very much indeed Is that

what you want

NATALIE
What’s wrong with wanting my

cooking to be noticed

ROLAND
Nothing But I don’t believe

this performance

down

He gestures at the kitchen at the candle and the frilly

apron she is wearing over her dress

ROLAND (CONT’D)
It’s just not you Nat So why

don’t you come out with it

NATALIE
Come out with what

ROLAND
If you want to shame me again

with this display-

NATALIE
- but I didn’t say anything

ROLAND
But you meant it And as I tell my

students just say what you mean
Natalie turns away and pulls off her apron furiously

NATALIE
I’m not your student I’m your

wife Or have you forgotten

ROLAND
The martyred wife finally comes out
with it

NATALIE
With what

ROLAND

The accusation

NATALIE
Roland IWhy do you

Natalie gives up and stares at him speechless Roland
looks up and sees her anguished tearful expression His
face softens and he gets up and wraps his arms round her

tenderly
Ginger’s head is lowered but she is watching them

ROLAND

(tenderly)
Why do I what Oh Nat

For a moment Natalie melts into Roland’s embrace
NATALIE
Why do you twist my words You make
everything seem as if it’s my
fault Why can’t you just be

normal -
Roland pulls away from her abruptly

ROLAND
Normal What the hell is normal

He crosses the kitchen flicks a switch and the room

suddenly flooded with a harsh white light

NATALIE

You know bloody well what I mean

ROLAND
Natalie Please How can I enjoy
eating in this atmosphere of

resentment
He sits down heavily

NATALIE
And how can I enjoy cooking when
you just gobble it up -

ROLAND
- Oh for God’s sake I’ve been
working all day -

NATALIE
But I made it for you

ROLAND
Emotional blackmail again

Natalie reaches for a handkerchief and blows her nose

ROLAND (CONT’D)
If the transitory nature of cooking
and eating offends you so much then
why don’t you take up your painting
again and make something for

posterity

NATALIE
(shouting)
With what Im scraping to pay the
bills with the money -

ROLAND

- yes - the money I earn -

NATALIE

- well it’s not enough for paint -

ROLAND
(shouting)
- then get a job

Roland stands up abruptly and starts to walk out of the

room

NATALIE
While you sod off to your bloody
yacht -
ROLAND
(quietly)

- boat Its a small boat -

NATALIE
- your bloody boat with some blonde
student again for all I know

Roland marches off angrily up the stairs slamming the door

behind him There is a long silence

NATALIE (CONTD)
(quietly)

Anyway what kind of job could I
get

Natalie sits down at the table Ginger stares unseeing at
her untouched plate of food They slowly turn to look at
each other
34 EXT PLAYGROUND —- DAY

They swing back and forth slowly

ROSA

GINGER
(gently)
I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if you

ROSA

GINGER

GINGER (CONT’D)
Did I also tell you he says the
word ‘dad’ makes him think of
slippers by the fire and other
bourgeois death-traps He has a

point of course

They both swing back and forth rhythmically

They both look up at Anoushka

balcony

The two girls sit and swing silently Rosa stubbornly

ROSA
What’s Natalie’s view of death-
traps

GINGER

Oh she just bursts into tears as
usual when he says stuff like
that Which he then says is -

GINGERROSA
(simultaneously)
- emotional blackmail

ANOUSHKA (VO)

ANOUSHKA
Rosa Can you bring the girls up

now

ignores her mother Anoushka gives up and disappears

who is leaning over the

Rosa

suddenly gets up and walks over towards the roundabout

Ginger follows her

ROSA
(decisively)
Our mothers are pathetic They
don’t believe in anything -

GINGER
- or do anything more to the
point

They sit down on the roundabout Ginger starts pushing it

and it begins to rotate

ROSA
Except moan about stuff

GINGER

At least your mum has a job
They are turning faster and faster

ROSA
Cleaning You call that a job
She hates it She moans on and

on

GINGER
Roland really hates the moaning
thing

ROSA
It’s no wonder -

GINGER
- no wonder what

ROSA
It’s no wonder they cant keep

their men
Ginger looks questioningly at Rosa as the roundabout spins
and the background behind them becomes a blur
EXT ROWING DINGHY - DUSK 35

Ginger and Rosa are sitting perched next to each other on a
narrow wooden seat in a small rowing dinghy gripping the
sides of the boat

Gingers father is rowing pulling the dinghy against the
strong current

Rosa stares at him admiringly He catches her eye briefly
and smiles

The dinghy moves slowly across the darkening expanse of
water towards a small sailing boat bobbing in the distance
in the evening mist

INT MAIN BOAT CABIN - DUSK 36

Ginger and Rosa lower themselves down a steep ladder into a
small cabin and sit side-by-side on a bunk as Gingers
father strikes a match and lights a lamp It flares into
life

He hangs the light on a hook and stares at it for a

moment before sprawling luxuriantly on the other bunk

The girls sit wide-eyed in the flickering shadows Rosa

with admiration Ginger with a nameless anxiety
Roland looks lovingly around the cabin

ROLAND
What could be better than this
Isn’t she marvellous Am I right

girls
Ginger nods mutely

ROSA
(softly)

It’s lovely It’s so romantic

ROLAND
Indeed There is poetry in small

spaces isn’t there Rosa

He lies there lost in thought as the waves lap against
the hull of the boat
ROLAND (CONT’D)
Confinement can be utterly
beautiful but only when its a
matter of choice

ROSA
(quietly)
What do you mean

ROLAND
What I mean is that a prison cell
on the contrary is the ugliest
expression of minimalism

Rosa stares at him He looks up and meets her gaze

ROSA
It must have been really terrible

Ginger told me about it

Roland glances questioningly at Ginger who looks down
her hands

ROLAND
Did she

ROSA
We tell each other everything

ROLAND
(lightly)
I’ve nothing to hide

at

The girls sit silently as Roland gazes up at the roof of

the cabin

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Prison was pretty brutal First
they strip you of your clothes
Then if you dare to protest they

strip you of all human contact

Roland turns his head slowly and looks at Rosa as if

is looking through her She returns his gaze intently

he

ROLAND (CONT’D)
But the worst thing about solitary
confinement Rosa is not that they
make you feel like an abandoned
child but that you start to doubt

your beliefs
Rosas eyes fill with tears

ROSA
I understand

Roland suddenly focuses on Rosa gazing at her thoughtfully
and tenderly

Ginger sits rigidly still glancing anxiously from one to
the other

INT SMALL BOAT CABIN - NIGHT 37

Ginger and Rosa lie silently in two narrow bunks in the
tiny cramped secondary cabin in the prow of the boat Rosa
is gazing into the darkness while Ginger listens to Roland
fiddling with the controls of a short-wave radio in the

main cabin

RADIO ANNOUNCER (VO)
The Soviet Defence Minister said
today that their missiles could
with one blow wipe off the face of
the earth the industrial centres of
the Unites States The British
government has announced that
nuclear missiles located on Royal
Airforce bases in the United
Kingdom are capable of the ultimate
retaliation against any Soviet
attack

GINGER
(whispering)
Did you hear that

ROSA
What

GINGER
About the missiles

Ginger watches Rosas profile in the dark etched by the

moonlight streaking in through a porthole Rosas eyes are

gleaming

Then Roland re-tunes the radio to a classical music

programme Schubert’s’ ‘Fantasie’ (a piano duet) is

playing After a while the music is joined by the sound of

Roland softly weeping

Rosa turns her head towards Ginger questioningly

GINGER (CONT’D)

Oh he always does that Especially

with Schubert

Rosa sits up quietly and presses her eye to
door to the main cabin

She stares at Roland mesmerised as he sits
in his hands softly weeping

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

a crack in the

with his head

Ginger is standing by a table in a chemistry lab

She adds a few drops of water through a pipette into a

flask which creates a sudden small but dramatic explosion

Ginger gazes at the flames then something catches her eye

She stands up straight suddenly as she catches sight of
Natalie approaching the school gates and walking

determinedly through them

She peers out of the window as Natalie walks across the

tarmac and disappears into the school building

INT COFFEE BAR - DAY

Rosa and Ginger sit opposite each other at a formica table

in a coffee-bar in Soho a cup of coffee in front of each

of them

Rosa is chewing a pencil as she tries to compose a letter

on a small pad of pale-blue notepaper

ROSA
What do you think I should say

GINGER
Who to

ROSA
Roland

Ginger looks startled

GINGER

Why are you writing to Roland

ROSA
Well I want to tell him that I
understand him You know like
sometimes in your soul you feel

well someone elses pain

Rosa stares down at the blank paper oblivious of Ginger’s

facial expression

ROSA (CONTD)
But I cant decide whether to start
with Dear Roland or Dearest
Roland What do you think

Gingers mouth moves but she cant speak

She gets up abruptly and turns away to put a coin in the
jukebox She chooses Little Richard singing “Tutti Frutti”
She leans against the jukebox and feels its rhythmic

pulsating vibrations with her fingertips
A young MAN comes and stands nearby watching her

MAN

Fancy a drink

INT GINGER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ginger leans over the edge of the bed and vomits onto the

floor Natalie suddenly appears in the doorway

NATALIE

Oh Ginger You and Rosa
Ginger screams at her between retching

GINGER

Go away You dont understand
Ginger moans Natalie approaches the bed

NATALIE

Ginger

GINGER
You came to my school I saw you
My teacher told me you said there
should be more so-called domestic

science lessons

NATALIE
Is that what this is all about

GINGER
How could you You want me to learn

housework At school

Natalie sits down on the bed next to Ginger

NATALIE
(heatedly)
Listen Ginger When I had you I
was just a teenager A teenager I
didnt know how to boil a bloody
egg Roland never lifted a finger

to help with anything

GINGER
That’s not my fault

NATALIE
Listen to me

Natalie puts her hand gently on Ginger’s shoulder

NATALIE (CONTD)
(softly)
I just don’t want you to struggle
like I did

GINGER
(screaming at her)

But I’m never going to have any
babies Never I don’t want to be

like you So bugger off

Natalie stares down at Ginger’s contorted face as her own

face drains of colour

NATALIE
You and Rosa are turning into
little sluts

Natalie gets up and turns to leave the room

GINGER
Anyway Im going to go and live
with Roland

Natalie stops in her tracks in the doorway

NATALIE
(quietly)
What are you talking about

41 EXT HOUSE - DAY

Ginger walks up to the entrance of a dark deserted-looking
building She rings the bell

After a long wait the door is opened by a tall elegant
man ROGER

ROGER
Hello

GINGER
Is Roland in at all

ROGER
Follow me

42 INT HOUSE - ROLAND’S ROOM - DAY

Ginger follows Roger up the stairs towards the sound of a
“roneo” machine which is rhythmically churning out

duplicated pages

Roger ushers Ginger into Roland’s room - a sparsely
furnished attic space containing a mattress on the floor a
desk some piles of books and the Roneo machine which
Roland is operating

ROGER
Visitor Roland

Roland turns around with an expression of surprise

He switches off the machine as Ginger approaches and
embraces her warmly Roger disappears back down the

stairs

ROLAND
What a surprise
Is everything alright

GINGER
Oh yes absolutely

She fidgets Roland looks slightly tense lost for words

ROLAND
Is Nat doing alright
Not too many scenes or anything

GINGER
Not too many

ROLAND
Good I’ll put the kettle on

He disappears for a moment and Ginger stands gazing round
the room Roland comes back and pulls out the chair next to
his desk
ROLAND (CONT’D)
Here have a seat

She sits down Roland perches on the edge of his desk

looks down at Ginger There is an awkward silence

GINGER
The thing is I was wondering

ROLAND
Yes

GINGER
If for example there was any
room I mean - I don’t know it may
not be feasible at all - but

She trails off looking at Roland hopefully

ROLAND
Room

GINGER
Here

Roland looks momentarily shocked

ROLAND
Well Jesus Ginger It’s a bit
»you here

Roland’s face softens He looks touched

ROLAND (CONT’D)
I supposed I could ask Rogerbut
look You do realise of course

I’m working more-or-less non-stop
Ginger nods mutely

ROLAND (CONT’D)
And that this is a completely
unsuitable environment for you in
every possible respect

GINGER
Absolutely

and

Ginger beams delightedly Roland looks at her
affectionately ruffles her hair and laughs A flicker of

sadness or perhaps guilt flashes across Ginger’s face

INT MARK’S KITCHEN —- DAY 43

Ginger looks tearful as she pulls off her coat and sits
down at the kitchen table with the two Marks

MARK
Are you quite sure this move is a
wise idea Ginger

Ginger turns to Mark Two

GINGER
How old were you when you left
home Mark Two

MARK TWO
I was about your age I had to go

my mother was an absolute monster
Ginger turns tearfully and triumphantly to Mark One

GINGER

You see

MARK

Nat is not a monster

GINGER
Not to you

MARK
Anyway Mark your mother was in
fact as I understand not a

monster but a gangster
Mark Two laughs

MARK TWO

Yes yes

GINGER
(quietly)
Was she a happy gangster

Both Marks fall silent Bella quietly appears in the
doorway behind Ginger clutching her bulging briefcase
Bella is about to greet Ginger but Mark silences her with a

small gesture They all turn to study Ginger kindly

MARK
Nat is unhappy darling But it’s

not because of you
Ginger is silent for a moment

GINGER
(softly)
But was she always unhappy You
know when she was my age You knew
her then

MARK
I did Yes

GINGER
Did she cry all the time before she

had me

MARK

She was troubled darling But then
we were all troubled It was

wartime

MARK TWO
It must have been an absolute
nightmare Bombs falling all the
time everywhere Nothing was

secure Nothing

GINGER
But what’s the difference We could

all die tomorrow

Bella nods

BELLA
We could Ginger For sure We

could
Mark Two glares at Bella

MARK TWO
Bella

BELLA

She’s right It is getting serious
Ginger turns to face Bella

GINGER
But I don’t want to die I want to

grow up and do things
The two Marks gaze at Ginger lovingly

MARK TWO
And you will honey you will

MARK
My darling Gingercant you be a
girl for a moment or two longer

Youll be a woman soon enough

44 EXT WASTEGROUND —- DAY 44

Rosa and Ginger are hanging out near a smouldering fire
amongst the bricks and rubble in the wasteground Rosa sits
on a rickety chair smoking a cigarette and gazing into the
fire while Ginger hovers nearby

Small children are running about playing and shouting as
they throw stones and set fire to broken furniture

ROSA
(dreamily)
Roland replied to my letter

GINGER
(quietly)
Did he What did he say

ROSA
He said he was very touched He has
such deep feelings Such fierce
feelings

GINGER
I know

ROSA
And he’s a pacifist

GINGER
I know

Ginger looks irritated Rosa looks defensive

ROSA
Well I think it’s really noble
It’s evil to kill

GINGER
Well exactly

ROSA
It’s one of the ten commandments

GINGER
Though shalt not etcetera
etcetera

ROSA
You sound a bit cynical

GINGER
Absolutely not But I don’t need a
commandment to work that one out I
think there are times for action
to stop total death

Ginger walks away angrily through the billowing smoke It
looks like a war-zone Rosa gets up slowly and follows her

Ginger turns back to Rosa and speaks heatedly

GINGER (CONT’D)
Look Rosa I totally admire my
father in every way but I’m just
not sure is it really so noble to
decide not to fight someone like

Hitler Mark says -

ROSA
- youre always quoting Mark -

GINGER
- and youre always quoting Roland
these days Mark told me he chose
not to fight in the war because he
didn’t want to kill anybody He was
an ambulance driver instead

ROSA
But Roland was in prison For being

a conscientious objector

Ginger suddenly looks very angry

Ginger stares at Rosa coldly trembling slightly

INT

HOUSE

GINGER
I know He’s my father And I’m

going to go and live with him

starting this week

ROSA

And I’m going sailing with him next

weekend Do you want to come
Actually he thought you should
probably

GINGER
What do you mean should

— DAY

Ginger is following Roland up the stairs into a small room

across the landing from his attic space

The room is extremely small and is piled high with boxes

and a clutter of old furniture

It has been furnished austerely with a narrow bed A bare
light-bulb dangles from the ceiling

Ginger stands holding a small record-player in one hand and

a basket with a few possessions in the other

ROLAND
(grinning)
One of the best rooms in the house

Small but perfectly formed Happy

Ginger smiles brightly - perhaps too brightly - and nods

her head vigorously

Roland leaves the room Ginger puts her teddy-bears down on
the bed plugs her record-player into a socket dangling
from the wall and takes a record out of her basket She

lowers the needle carefully onto the record
It’s Sidney Bechet playing ‘Petite Fleur’

She sits down on the bed pulling her dufflecoat tightly
around her and looks around the room as the music soars

heartbreakingly

EXT BOAT —- DAY

Ginger Rosa and Roland are sitting in the cockpit of his

boat sailing on the open sea

Rosa glances at Ginger and then moves closer to Roland who
guides her hand onto the tiller They whisper to each

other intimately

Ginger stares out at the sea then leans out and dangles
her head in the rushing water Then she gets up and starts
to edge along the deck She eventually reaches the prow of
the boat as it plunges up and down through the waves

She sits there trembling as wind lashes her face and
body

Behind her Roland and Rosa are oblivious of everything
except each other high delirious with the danger of their

flirtation

INT SMALL BOAT CABIN - NIGHT 47

Ginger lies in her sleeping bag in the tiny cabin in the
prow of the boat clutching her paperback copy of TS
Eliot The other bunk is empty

She reads the same phrase over and over to herself

GINGER
(muttering)
“This is how the world ends this
is how the world ends not with a
bang not with a bang”

There is a low murmur of voices in the main cabin
Then silence

Some giggling

Then a low masculine moan

Ginger grabs the pillow and desperately covers her ears
with it as the moans are joined by high female yelping

noises

FADE TO BLACK

INT MARK’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT 48

Ginger sits silently at the table at a small dinner party
held by the two Marks Natalie sits opposite her and has
clearly made an effort to dress up for the occasion Bella
sits clutching her bulging briefcase on her lap which is

making it awkward to reach forward to sip her soup

Another MALE GUEST notices and gestures questioningly at
Mark

MARK
Bella will not be parted from her
work in progress Under any

circumstances

Bella nods affirmatively

BELLA
Well there are certain things that

one must hold on to

MARK TWO
Dont you think theres

occasionally an argument for

letting go dear
Bella turns towards Ginger

BELLA
Dont be fooled by such phoney
modernity Ginger “Letting-go”

Please

Ginger tries to smile

MARK TWO
(gently)
Surely even a poetess should be
able to enjoy her soup especially

when it’s been made by Mark

BELLA
But one is not a poet-ess Mark
Two just as one is not a doctor-
ess or a physicist-ess

Ginger looks up at Bella intrigued

DINNER GUEST

Here we go

BELLA
No this is not a matter of
principle but one of precise
language Names are word-objects

and must be given due respect

MARK TWO
That’s an interesting concept
Bella

Bella turns to Ginger

BELLA
By the way Im curious I
understand why you have this
adorable nickname Ginger but
whats the name on your birth
certificate

Ginger glances anxiously at Natalie who looks down at her

plate

There is a long silence as Ginger hesitates awkwardly She
turns to Mark for help He smiles at her encouragingly

GINGER

(shyly)
My father named me Africa

BELLA

Africa Any particular reason

GINGER

(quietly)
He said it was in honour of Freuds
theory of the dark continent of

woman

The other dinner guest lets out a guffaw but is silenced

by Mark who makes a protective gesture

BELLA
(muttering)

Oh dear Freud

DINNER GUEST
Is this the famous Roland who holds

us all in his theoretical spell

Mark Two kicks him vigorously under the table Natalie
gets up quietly from the table and disappears out of the
room There is an awkward pause in the conversation

BELLA
Well let’s just stick with Ginger
then shall we

(MORE)

BELLA (CONTD)
Although you could always move on
to Scarlet in due time As in
flame not O’Hara That’s a good
name for an activist How’s all
that going by the way

Ginger brightens for the first time in the conversation

GINGER
I’m thinking of joining the
Committee of 100 actually I agree
with Bertrand Russell

BELLA
And what do you agree with

GINGER
About direct action He says “the
danger of nuclear war is too great

for lawful protest”

Mark gets up quietly from the table He gestures to Mark

Two indicating that he is going off to check on Natalie

BELLA
So you think marching is not

enough

GINGER
It may not be enough to save us

You know from total extinction

Bella looks at Ginger with interest The others no longer

know where to look

INT ROLAND’S KITCHEN - NIGHT 49

Ginger and Rosa are standing side by side in front of the
sink in Roland’s untidy kitchen They look stiff and ill at
ease in each others’ presence in sharp contrast to the easy

familiarity they once had

Ginger pins a ban-the-bomb badge on her sweater and glances
at Rosa’s outfit The two girls are no longer wearing

identical clothes

Rosa is in a skirt and tight sweater while Ginger is
wearing jeans with her sloppy sweater as usual Rosa

expertly applies dark make-up round her eyes

There is an uncharacteristic silence between the two girls
The air is heavy with tension

GINGER

(quietly)
Where are you going

ROSA
To a restaurant Where are you
going

GINGER
To a meeting

ROSA
See you later then

GINGER”
(anxiously)
So you’re coming back here

ROSA
Maybe

They glance at each other uneasily

ROSA (CONT’D)
Do you want to try

She hands Ginger her eye make-up awkwardly before turning
and walking out of the room Ginger holds the eye make-up

and stares at herself in the mirror

INT CHURCH HALL - NIGHT

Ginger edges her way through a large crowd in the church

hall Tony is addressing the meeting

TONY
This crisis is taking the world to
the brink of catastrophe

(MORE)

TONY (CONTD)
The Russians have put their
missiles on Cuba as we know as
part of the deadly battle with the
United States for world supremacy
that could end with no world at
all And what is our government

doing about it

Ginger pushes her way into a space where she can see Tony

She looks breathless intense and is wearing dark eye make-

up for the first time

TONY (CONTD)
They tell people to put sandbags
over their windows and stay
indoors Meanwhile the government
has built top secret bomb shelters
underground But only enough space

for themselves

Ginger suddenly raises her hand Tony stops speaking and

gestures towards her

GINGER
Then who will be left for them to
govern Everyone else will be dead
Burnt to cinders
I think its immoral You know to

use precise language

Tony nods at Ginger affirmatively as people in the crowd

turn around to look at her intrigued

INT PUB

Tony and
crowded

who have

- NIGHT

Ginger are standing at the bar in a noisy
smoke-filled pub amongst a lively voluble group

moved on after the meeting

TONY
Let me guess You shouldn’t really
be in here You’re still at school

aren’t you

Ginger shrugs nonchalantly

GINGER

Some of the time

TONY
Dont worry Ill buy you a drink

Tony gets the attention of the barman

TONY (CONTD)
A pint and and a half please

GINGER
Thanks Anyway I learn more at
these meetings than I ever do at

school

TONY
That goes without saying I think

The barman hands Tony the drinks He gives the half-pint

glass to Ginger

GINGER
Thanks

They edge their way through the crowd and sit down next to

each other pressed close in the crush

GINGER (CONT’D)

Are youAre you a student
Tony smiles at Ginger

TONY

I’m at art school Do you draw

GINGER
(hurriedly)

Oh yes definitely Sometimes
She blushes confused

GINGER (CONT’D)
But I think I’m more of a poet
actually

TONY

Are you

GINGER
My mum used to be a painter
though

TONY

What’s her name

GINGER
Oh you wouldn’t know it She gave
it up you know toto have me I

live with my father now anyway

Tony looks a little surprised at this sudden rush of

private information

GINGER (CONT’D)
He’s a pacifist He writes articles
and stuff

TONY
Anything I might have read

GINGER

‘The Idea of Freedom’
Tony looks impressed

TONY

He’s your father
Ginger nods and looks down shyly tongue-tied and gulps
at her beer She grimaces at the bitter unfamiliar taste
INT ROLAND’S HOUSE - NIGHT 52
Ginger walks quietly up the stairs towards her attic room

She can hear music and the sound of typing coming from
Roland’s room She tiptoes towards the door and peers

through a crack

Roland is sitting at his desk concentrating on his
writing Rosa appears behind him wraps her arms around
him sensuously and kisses the top of his head Roland

looks up and smiles at Rosa

Ginger creeps away into her room and shuts the door She
lies down on her bed clutching her teddy-bears and stares

into the darkness

FADE TO BLACK

INT ROLAND’S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Roland is sitting drinking wine at the table in his
kitchen The bottle is nearly empty and Roland seems
distinctly tipsy The table is laid for supper but it

looks as if Roland has been waiting for a while
Roger is standing nearby clutching a wineglass

Ginger and Rosa are hovering by the stove over a huge

saucepan of spaghetti

ROSA
Ginger Try it I think it might be

done

Ginger tests a strand of spaghetti then drains the pan
into a colander and carries it towards the table Rosa
follows with another pan and starts ladling sauce onto the

spaghetti on the plates She turns towards Roger

ROSA (CONTD)

Are you sure you don’t want any

Roger smiles

ROGER
I’m fine thank you I’ve already

eaten

Roland eats a mouthful

ROLAND
Not bad Not bad

Roger chortles as Roland leans back and catches his eye

smiling

ROGER
Who’s the chef

ROSA
We made it together Me and Ginger

ROLAND
Mutual aid This is good

ROGER

Communist cooks How marvellous

ROLAND
Anarchists I think

ROSA
It’s Italian actually Bolognese

Roger laughs

ROGER
Oh there’s lots of anarchists in

Bologna
Rosa suddenly looks confused Is he making fun of her

Roland takes another swig of red wine stops eating and
looks Rosa up and down He studies her legs the fish-net

stockings the short skirt

ROLAND
(quietly)

You are a thing of beauty Rosa
Ginger looks down at her plate

Roland stands up and walks over towards Rosa Rosa falls

into his arms and rests her head on his chest blissfully

Roger stares fascinated at Rosa’s ecstatic expression and
then at Ginger’s lowered head

When he sees that tears are rolling down Ginger’s face
Roger’s expression changes and he starts to walk away

quietly He leaves the room

Roland sits down again at the table opposite Ginger He
looks up at her face which is etched with misery Rosa
stares at Ginger guiltily Roland’s face softens as he

studies Ginger’s face

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Oh Ginger

54 INT NATALIE’S FRONT DOOR AND HALLWAY —- DAY 54

Ginger runs up the steps towards Natalie’s front door and
knocks rapidly Natalie opens the door and seems surprised

to see Ginger standing there

NATALIE

Ginger

Ginger walks through the hallway into the living room
followed by Natalie They stand facing each other There
is an awkward silence Then they both start talking at

once

GINGER
(hesitantly)
Look Mum
NATALIE

(simultaneously)

How is everything
They fall silent again Then Ginger tries again

GINGER
Can I stay the night tonight

Natalie looks closely at Ginger who avoids her gaze and

wanders away across the room

GINGER (CONT’D)
Im not moving back or anything

Ginger stares at an easel placed where Roland’s desk once
stood She looks at the painting on the easel the brushes
and the tubes of paint

GINGER (CONT’D)

Youre painting again

NATALIE
Yes I am And a bit of studying

now that

Natalie hesitates and gestures around the empty house then

looks down at her hands
Ginger pauses before answering in a small voice

GINGER
Well that’s good

NATALIE
But I could make up your bed

She trails off and glances at Ginger noticing her hurt
expression Ginger turns away and looks out of the window

to hide her face

NATALIE (CONTD)
Arent you happy at Rolands After
going on and on about wanting to
live with him instead of boring old

me
Ginger turns back to look at Natalie

GINGER
I never said that About being
boring But of course I’m happy
over there It’s really

interesting

Ginger starts moving back towards the hallway She puts on

a bright expression

GINGER (CONT’D)
It was just a thought anyway
Dont bother with the bed or

anything I was just passing

EXT WASTEGROUND - DUSK

Ginger sits alone leaning against the corrugated iron
fence which surrounds the wasteground She doesn’t move

It’s an image of desolation

INT HOUSE - GINGER’S ROOM - NIGHT
Ginger is startled awake

It is Roland who has switched the light-bulb on in her
room and is carrying a steaming bowl of stew towards her
bed

He holds it out stiffly defensively Ginger blinks in the
light

ROLAND

Ive made you some supper

GINGER
(blearily)
What time is it

ROLAND
About two Or so Somewhat late
But I cooked it You said you were

hungry

GINGER
Well I was

Roland looks hurt

ROLAND

Youre not going to eat it

Ginger sits up hurriedly

GINGER
Oh yes yes it looks delicious I

didn’t know you could cook

ROLAND
Nor did I

Roland sits down on the bed next to Ginger He watches

she forces down the hot chunks of meat and potatoes

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Look I know it’s all got a bit

complicated
Ginger eats avoiding his eyes

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Perhaps I can never be the kind of
father you really want I’m not
sure that I’m father material

really
Ginger looks up at him wide-eyed anxious

GINGER
Oh but you are I never said I

wanted anything different did I

ROLAND
Youve never really complained
about anything Youre not a
moaner as a rule thank God But
look

Roland gets up and crosses the tiny room He leans back

against the wall

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Things have been difficult for me

with Nat for a long time

Ginger pauses between mouthfuls and glances at Rolands

expression Intense preoccupied preparing to say more

as
ROLAND (CONT’D)
One day you will understand that
real love when it comes is like a
siren-call One simply has no

choice One must surrender
Roland makes a gesture of submission
Ginger isn’t eating anymore

Roland comes back and sits down next to Ginger again

suddenly seems lost uncharacteristically for words

ROLAND (CONT’D)
But listen I am aware that
perhaps you might not be entirely
happy with the situation

He

He looks at Ginger his eyes brimming with anxiety Ginger

gazes at him fighting down her nameless feelings Then she

seems to make a decision and speaks in a strong reassuring

voice

GINGER

How can anyone be happy When you
know about the Bomb Happiness is
not really an option when you know
the world could be blown to pieces

any minute
Roland visibly relaxes
Ginger studies his face Yes she has pleased him

ROLAND
You are a good girl Ginger A born

radical unsurprisingly

Ginger attempts a smile Roland looks at Ginger fondly

gets up and walks over to the door But he hesitates

ROLAND (CONT’D)
Listen It’s probably best not to
say anything to Nat about the times
with Rosa on the boat and so on

I’m sure we agree on this

Their eyes meet and each hurriedly looks away again

INT ROLAND’S KITCHEN —- DAY 57

Ginger tiptoes across the kitchen towards the sink in the
early morning light She looks exhausted She starts
washing her face at the sink scrubbing her skin violently
with a face-cloth Roland coughs in the adjacent room and
switches on the radio It’s a broadcast of President

Kennedy in the middle of making a speech
Ginger freezes as she listens to his voice

PRESIDENT KENNEDY (VO)
We will not prematurely or
unnecessarily risk the costs of
worldwide nuclear war in which even
the fruits of victory would be
ashes in our mouth But neither
will we shrink from that risk at

any time it must be faced

EXT PARK GARDENS - DAY 58

Ginger sits on the long wooden bench she had once sat on
with Rosa to play clapping games She looks dazed frozen

The ground is covered with snow

PRESIDENT KENNEDY (VO) (CONT’D)
The cost of freedom is always high
but Americans have always paid it
And one path we shall never choose
the path of surrender or

submission

Ginger lies down on her back on the snowy ground then

reaches out and grasps a handful of ice and mud as if she

is holding onto the earth itself

INT COFFEE BAR - EVENING

Ginger sits at a table at the usual coffee bar still
wearing her snow-soaked school uniform She is

concentrating intently as she writes in her notebook

GINGER (VO)
(quietly)
dreamed there was
wall of flame
screamed because

was to blame

HHH PH

looked around
No night no day
No sky no ground

Nothing to say

She suddenly looks up as the door opens and Rosa walks

Ginger closes her notebook

ROSA
(distractedly)
Sorry I’m late We were talking and
talking I didn’t notice the time

It was so

GINGER (CONT’D)
(sarcastically)
- intense Right

Rosa avoids her gaze

ROSA
Well it was And I think I think

Roland is wounded
Ginger looks startled

GINGER
What do you mean What’s happened

in

ROSA
Wounded emotionally I mean And
spiritually I think I can help

him

GINGER
(hotly)
Help him How can you help him

ROSA

We have a lot in common you know

GINGER
Such as
ROSA
(defensively)

Such as the fact that his mother
left him when he was little You
know like my father left me

GINGER
(sarcastically)
Oh What a way to bond

ROSA
(defiantly)
Well yes actually We understand

each other He confides in me

Ginger stares at Rosa who looks away uncomfortably The

two girls sit silently for a moment

Then Rosa looks down at Ginger’s notebook

ROSA (CONTD)

Anyway what are you writing

GINGER
A poem About the end of the world

Haven’t you heard

ROSA
Heard what
GINGER
About the crisis Remember those

missiles in Cuba

ROSA
What missiles

GINGER
Where have you been Don’t you care

about the future any more

ROSA
Not everyone can save the whole
world like you Ginger Some of us
have to concentrate on just one

person
Ginger’s face is burning

GINGER

You can’t save my dad

ROSA
Why not

GINGER

Who do you think you are

ROSA
Who do you think you are You can’t
stop a war if there’s going to be
one It’s in the hands of God

GINGER
That’s convenient

Whose hands are you in then
Rosa looks away avoiding Ginger’s angry gaze

GINGER (CONT’D)
Just wait he’ll dump you too when

you’re older

ROSA
No he won’t

GINGER
He will he will

There is another awkward silence Then Rosa looks at

Ginger calmly

ROSA
We didn’t want to tell you

GINGER
Didn’t want to tell me what

Ginger stares at Rosa the colour draining from her face

GINGER (CONT’D)
What What didn’t you want to tell

me
ROSA
I thinkI’m pregnant
INT HOUSE - GINGER’S ROOM - NIGHT 60

Ginger is lying fully dressed and rigidly still on her bed

in her tiny room

Wild frantic jazz is playing extremely loud on her record
player (Bird Gets the Worm - Charlie Parker and Miles

Davis)

Ginger stares unseeing towards the ceiling

EXT STREETS - DUSK 61

Ginger runs and runs breathing hard oblivious of her
surroundings which become a blur behind her desperate

figure

EXT ROAD-SIDE - DUSK 62

Ginger stands restlessly by the side of the road
hitchhiking A car draws up and she gets in hurriedly The
car radio is playing

Ginger stares out of the window appearing more and more

agitated as she listens to the broadcast

RADIO ANNOUNCER
There are persistent reports that
the American government is about to
make a sensational move in the Cuba
Crisis Lord Bertrand Russell ina
statement released today said
‘While life remains to us we will
not cease to do what lies in our
power to avert the greatest
calamity that has ever threatened

mankind’

EXT AIRFORCE BASE - NIGHT 63

Ginger runs through the middle of a chaotic crowd of
demonstrators at an airforce base outside London There are
angry shouts and waves of chanting as the crowd surges up

to the barbed wire enclosure

CROWD
(chanting)
Block the gates Block the gates

This is a demonstration that looks as if it could become
violent The ominous sound of marching feet in the distance
indicates the heavy presence of police The headlights of
military trucks shine blindingly onto the crowd as the
vehicles attempt to push through towards the gates Ginger
looks frightened

CROWD (CONTD)
Ban the bomb Ban the bomb

VOICE IN LOUD-HAILER
Sit down Everybody sit down

Some people start sitting on the ground in front of the
gates Others trip over them as they run away Ginger looks
around suddenly panicking until she catches sight of a

familiar face in the distance Its Bella

Ginger pushes her way through the crowd and sits down on

the ground next to Bella

BELLA

Ginger

GINGER

Yes it’s me
Ginger looks wide-eyed with fear

Bella looks round at the sound of shouts and scuffling in
the distance A long line of police is getting closer and
closer lifting up demonstrators and throwing them
violently out of the path of the advancing trucks Bella

looks closely at Ginger

BELLA
Are you alright My God youre
shivering Here lean on me This

could get rough okay Hold tight
Bella puts her arms protectively around Ginger

The line of police gets closer and closer and the noise and
confusion increases Ginger is dragged away roughly by two

policemen

GINGER
(screams )

Bella Bella

BELLA

Ginger
Ginger is thrown into the back of a police van where she
sits shivering
64 INT POLICE CELL - NIGHT

Ginger lies on a bench in a tiny police cell immobile

during a long dark night

INT POLICE CELL —- DAY 65

Ginger now sits leaning against the wall in the cell in
the morning light A POLICE DOCTOR is in the cell with her

POLICE DOCTOR
I am a doctor You can speak freely

to me

Ginger doesn’t respond She looks catatonic The police

doctor sighs

POLICE DOCTOR (CONT’D)
I can’t help you if you won’t talk
Do you understand You seem

depressed Are you depressed
Ginger shakes her head but does not turn to look at him

POLICE DOCTOR (CONT’D)
Then speak

But Ginger remains silent

INT POLICE STATION - DAY 66

Ginger is led out of her cell by a policewoman along a

long corridor towards a waiting area

Mark and Mark Two accompanied by a shaken-looking Bella
have come to bail out Ginger and take her home They stand
in the long neon-lit corridor with the police doctor He

looks from one to the other puzzled

POLICE DOCTOR

Are you the girl’s mother

BELLA

No No I’m not

POLICE DOCTOR

Where is the mother

MARK
She doesn’t know her daughter is

here

POLICE DOCTOR
Then is one of you the girl’s
father

MARK
(firmly)
We are family friends We’ve come

to take her home

Ginger sits on a bench the policewoman standing beside
her Ginger is apparently oblivious of the small group

standing talking together in the corridor

POLICE DOCTOR
(softly)
She needs help All this protesting
is a front you know The girl may

be seriously mentally ill

BELLA
(muttering)

Oh for Christ’s sake

MARK TWO
(angrily)
Maybe she is justifiably worried
about a possible nuclear holocaust

Have you considered this
Ginger sits motionless unresponsive staring into the
distance
INT NATALIE’S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The two Marks and Bella are hovering near Ginger who is now
sitting on a chair in Natalie’s living room The room looks

emptier and more bleak than ever

Natalie is sitting on a chair opposite Ginger watching her

anxiously Roland is sitting on the stairs in the hallway

making it clear that he is a reluctant participant in this

group meeting

NATALIE
(pleadingly)
Just talk to us darling Come on

Ginger sits immobile silent

MARK
Did they hurt you Ginger you must
tell us

Natalie turns around and gestures at Roland to join them
the room He stays put She sighs and turns back towards

Ginger

NATALIE
(softly)
Please Say something

There is no response from Ginger

NATALIE (CONTD)
Okay listen I’ve asked Anoushka
to bring Rosa over I thought maybe
youd talk to her if you don’t want
to talk to us

Ginger’s face starts to move for the first time in an

expression of fear and disgust

NATALIE (CONTD)
Don’t make that face at me -

MARK
Nat don’t -

NATALIE
- but I care about her

Ginger suddenly breaks her silence and bursts out

in

GINGER
You don’t care

BELLA
Actually I think she does

sweetheart

GINGER
She doesn’t care that the world
might end

NATALIE
Of course I do I’m on your side

Ginger
Ginger looks up at Natalie her face agonised contorted

GINGER
You don’t know anything

BELLA

What else doesn’t she know

There is a long silence as Ginger struggles Bella gazes at

her calmly

BELLA (CONTD)

Ginger
Ginger looks up and meets the tenderness in Bella’s eyes

GINGER
I can’t say it I’ll explode if I

say it

BELLA
No you wont sugar It’s alright

Speak it out

GINGER
(screaming)
I can’t I can’t
We’re all going to die You said
it

BELLA
No I said we could A nuclear war
would probably obliterate us all if
it happened But that’s not what

you mean is it
Ginger shakes her head

BELLA (CONTD)
(firmly)
Then what is it that you can’t say

Ginger What can’t you say

Ginger glances quickly at Roland who is staring darkly at

the floor in the hallway almost out of earshot

There is a moment that seems forever where all the adults
- except Roland - stare at Ginger Then the dam bursts and

the tears stream down Ginger’s face

GINGER
(sobbing quietly)
That Roland is is

sleepingwith Rosa
Natalie freezes She stares at Ginger

NATALIE
(quietly)
What Rosa

Natalie suddenly stumbles to her feet and rushes out

towards Roland

NATALIE (CONTD)
Is it true

Roland avoids her gaze and remains silent

NATALIE (CONTD)
I knew it I knew something was

going on - and you

Bella has put her arms round Ginger and is comforting her

GINGER
(sobbing quietly)
It’s not my fault

BELLA

No of course not
Natalie suddenly loses control and lashes out at Roland

NATALIE
(shouting)
How long has this been going on

She hits him wildly but he turns and holds her at arm’s
length gripping her wrists

ROLAND
For God’s sake Natalie

NATALIE
Let go of me Let go of me I have
to get hold of Anoushka I don’t
want to see Rosa I don’t want to

see that little bitch
Natalie wrenches herself free and runs upstairs

Ginger struggles to her feet her face contorted

GINGER
I’ve got to get out onto the
streets - leaflets got to give out
leaflets -

MARK

- Not right now darling -

GINGER
- Yes now Don’t you understand

The world may be about to end

Ginger looks wildly around the room with an agonised

expression Bella puts her arms around her again and helps

her to sit down Mark turns to Roland

MARK
(furiously)

Do you see what you’ve done

Roland turns slowly to confront the group of angry faces
glaring at him He turns ashen and looks as if he is

facing a firing squad

ROLAND
(quietly)
What right have you to judge me
I’ve spent my whole life fighting

against tyranny

BELLA
(sarcastically)
Congratulations

ROLAND
Not only the tyranny of government
but also the tyranny of the shoulds
and oughts of so-called ‘normal’

family life -

BELLA

- Oh how fucking convenient

Roland suddenly moves further into the room staring coldly

at Bella who is standing protectively next to Ginger

ROLAND
And who the fuck are you to lecture
me We’ve only just met Not that
it’s any of your business but
Natalie and I are separated you

know

BELLA
You have a child together

She indicates Ginger whose tear-stained face is contorted

with anxiety
ROLAND
She’s no longer a child

Ginger looks up slowly at Roland He quickly looks away
Mark takes a step towards Roland

MARK
(angrily)
Ginger may be grown up enough to
try to save us all from nuclear
catastrophe Roland but she is
also young enough to need some

looking after
Roland turns towards Mark

ROLAND
Listen Autonomous thought
personal truth freedom of

action
Roland puts a hand on Mark’s arm

ROLAND (CONT’D)
You believe in those don’t you
Mark

MARK

Yes of course I do but this is -

ROLAND
- well these have been my guiding

principles

Roland stares at the Marks and at Bella scanning their

hostile faces

ROLAND (CONT’D)
I deeply believe in them And I was
jailed for them

Ginger looks up slowly and stares at Roland with an

agonised expression a mix of fear guilt and empathy

There is a silence as Roland edges crosses the room and

sits down opposite Ginger

ROLAND (CONT’D)
(gently)
Dont you see Ginger there would
not even be the possibility of
nuclear war - or any war - if
millions of men had been prepared
to stand up against authority as I

did and refuse to join the army

The doorbell rings Nobody moves

Roland moves closer to Ginger She listens intently as he

speaks to her in his quiet passionate voice

ROLAND (CONTD)
Refuse to take orders

The doorbell rings again insistently
The two Marks look at each other questioningly

ROLAND (CONT’D)
(urgently)
It’s mindless obedience that is the
killer Ginger I’ve broken the

rules

all the rules - because
someone has to say no Do you see

Ginger

The doorbell rings a third time and Mark starts to walk

of the room towards the front door
Natalie runs down the stairs and blocks his path

NATALIE
No Please Mark No

Mark grips Natalie firmly by the arm

MARK
Come on ducky We’ve got to get
this sorted out once and for all

Come on

out

Natalie seems to crumple at his reasonable affectionate
tone of voice and they disappear into the hallway to

answer the front door

Roland reaches out and cautiously takes Ginger’s hand His
expression changes as if he is really seeing her for the

first time

ROLAND
(whispering)

Oh Ginger
Roland’s eyes start to brim with tears

Natalie and Anoushka start talking in low angry voices in
the hallway as Rosa appears in the doorway to the living

room She stands nervously looking at Roland’s back-view
as he sits holding Ginger’s hand Ginger looks up at Rosa

Their eyes meet

NATALIE (VO)
She’s sleeping with Roland

ANOUSHKA (VO)
Who

NATALIE (VO)
Rosa

ANOUSHKA (VO)
What Rosa With Roland

Roland turns around and looks at Rosa standing just inside
the room then gets up and walks over to stand beside her
Anoushka marches into the room white-faced She stops
glances around taking in the scene then takes a step

towards Rosa

ANOUSHKA
Is it true Rosa

Rosa remains silent and looks away

Natalie appears in the doorway and stares at Rosa Rosa
instinctively places a hand on her gently swelling belly

Natalie sees the gesture and turns slowly to look at
Ginger Ginger nods mutely Natalie freezes horrified
and then runs up the stairs noisily A door bangs and then

everything goes silent

ANOUSHKA (CONTD)
Answer me Rosa

ROSA
(quietly)
Why should I

ANOUSHKA

Because I’m your mother

ROSA
I didn’t notice

Anoushka slaps Rosa violently across the face

Roland wearily lifts up a hand to protect Rosa but is too
late

Ginger rises slowly to her feet and walks over to Mark He

looks at her tenderly

GINGER
(whispering anxiously)
Do you think Mum’s alright

MARK

Come come

Mark and Ginger leave the room together

68 INT LANDING OUTSIDE NATALIE’S BEDROOM —- DAY 68

Ginger and Mark are standing outside the door to Natalie’s

bedroom

MARK

Nat Nat darling Can we come in

There’s no response

MARK (CONTD)
Right We’re coming in

He turns the handle and pushes the door It’s locked He

starts to pummel at the door

MARK (CONTD)
Nat open the door Nat open this

door Nat open up
Ginger shouts down the stairs frantically

GINGER

Roland Come quick

INT OUTSIDE NATALIE’S BEDROOM - DAY 69

Roland is throwing himself against Natalie’s door again

and again
The door eventually crashes open

Natalie is crouched on the floor cramming pills from a
small bottle into her mouth Empty bottles lie strewn on

the floor around her

GINGER
(screaming)

Mum Mum

Roland looks aghast He runs over to Natalie kneels down

and cradles her head in his arms

ROLAND
Oh Nat darling oh Nat

Mark hovers in the doorway Rosa appears silently behind

him staring into the room shocked

ROLAND (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Call an ambulance

Ginger runs out of the room Rosa reaches out and clutches

at her as she passes

ROSA

Ginger Forgive me Please
Their eyes lock briefly before Ginger pulls herself
and clatters down the stairs
INT HOSPITAL WAITING AREA - NIGHTDAY

Ginger and Roland sit silently side by side on an
uncomfortable-looking bench in the stark depressing
waiting area of the Emergency Department They look

exhausted beyond words
It’s a long and agonising wait

As the morning light creeps through the windows Roland

free

closes his eyes and leans his head back against the wall

Ginger takes her notebook out of her coat pocket turns

away from Roland and slowly starts to write She pauses

from time to time as she searches for the right words

GINGER (VO)

We had a dream that we would always
be best friends

When we were born for some it was
the end

Now it seems there may not be
tomorrow

But despite the horror and the
sorrow

I love our world I want us all to
live

Now Rosa you’ve asked me to
forgive

One day if Mum survives this
bitter night

Then we shall meet again and I will

say
Ginger pauses gazing into space

GINGER (V0O) (CONTD)
I loved you Rosa Don’t you see
But we are different

(MORE )

GINGER (VO) (CONT’D)
You dream of everlasting love Not

me

Roland opens his eyes and sits very still He turns his

head and watches Ginger writing

GINGER (VO) (CONTD)
Because what really matters is to
live

And then there will be nothing to

forgive

ROLAND

What are you writing

GINGER
A poem About the future

Roland stares sadly at Ginger’s back-view

ROLAND

I’m sorry Ginger I’m so sorry

Ginger turns slowly and looks at him They gaze at
other silently The Ginger turns back and continues

write in her little notebook

GINGER (VO)
But I’1l forgive you anyway

She slowly and quietly closes her notebook

THE END
