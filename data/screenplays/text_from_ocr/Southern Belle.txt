FADE IN

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
An overcast sky

A dark truck cruises down the two-lane blacktop passing
hideous trailers

The pick-up slows as it nears a dirt road

INT TRUCK - MOVING - DAY

Broken radio A cigarette pack rests in the cupholder A
camcorder sits in the passenger’s seat

CHRIS WHITEHEAD 28 drugged-out ne’er-do-well handles the
wheel feeling every bump the old road has to offer

His frenetic eyes stare out the windshield searching for a
certain spot

LOUISE (VO)
(whisper )
Chris
EXT ABANDONED LOT - NIGHT

Woods everywhere Not a house in sight

Rampant weeds conquer the secluded yard Empty bottles and
cans scatter across the lawn

The truck pulls in
Chris steps out

LOUISE (VO)
Chris

Chris stumbles around panicking

CHRIS
Where are you

He stops stunned
Chris sees LOUISE LEWTON 16 innocent country girl

standing a few feet away A torn dress covers her smooth
skin She glares at Chris holding his gaze
Chris’s eyes go blank Hypnotized He stares at Louise like
he needs her approval

LOUISE (VO)
I’m watching

Louise watches Chris undress He pulls down his boxers He’s
naked vulnerable

Leaning over Chris grabs the camcorder He places it on the
truck’s hood

The camcorder’s red record light glows

LOUISE (VO)
It’s your turn Chris

Chris grabs a longneck off the ground He SLAMS it against
the pick-up SMASHING it into a million pieces His bloodied
hand grips a large shard

LOUISE (VO)
Do it Chris

Facing Louise he gets down on his knees

LOUISE (VO)
Do it for me

Chris opens his mouth Raises the sharp piece of glass over
it

He slowly lowers the shard the glass disappearing down his
throat going deeper and deeper

Louise watches him with merciless eyes

Blood trickles down Chris’s mouth as he stares at her He
gags WHEEZING up blood

One final shove Like a spear the glass protrudes out the
back of Chris’s neck

He collapses to the ground Convulses

Blood flows around the lodged shard running through the
tall grass

All the while the unrelenting camera records the grisly
scene

Chris goes still lifeless

His body lies in the yard all alone Louise is gone
EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
Afternoon The sun struggles to break through

A Honda zips down the desolate road

INT HONDA - MOVING - DAY

Messy cramped An early-2000s pop SONG plays on the radio
VIVIEN TRACY 33 elegant yet headstrong sits behind the
wheel Her husband JAMIE 28 scrawny introvert slouches

over in the passenger’s seat

Vivien’s cell phone lies in the cupholder A flamboyant
flyer hangs out of her purse Welcome back Class of 2006

Gazing out the window Vivien admires all of the local
farmland

VIVIEN
It’s gorgeous

Jamie glances at the fields unimpressed

JAMIE
Looks the same

Vivien grabs her phone and checks the GPS Ten miles from
their destination

JAMIE
You know you don’t have to do this

Vivien looks at him a little confused

VIVIEN
What do you mean

Jamie shifts in his seat

JAMIE
Coming here It’s not your reunion

She rests her hand on his leg

VIVIEN

Florida or something Fuck all

JAMIE
I’m telling you you’re gonna be
bored as fuck This town’s nothing

VIVIEN

JAMIE
Sadly

Like an excited tourist Vivien points toward a herd of
cattle grazing in a wide field

VIVIEN
Look at it It’s so pastoral

JAMIE

Peaceful

Grinning Jamie points her toward a dilapidated shack
JAMIE

VIVIEN
The only time I ever heard anything

Vivien wraps her arm around Jamie

VIVIEN
This is going to be fun It’1l be
like solving a mystery

JAMIE
Yikes

VIVIEN
The enigmatic Jamie Tracy

JAMIE
Enigmatic

VIVIEN
Strange elusive Like a riddle

JAMIE
You make me sound like a magician

VIVIEN
And you sound like you’ve got
something to hide

A flamboyant DJ chats over a TRACK’s final seconds
DJ (VO)

weekend

VIVIEN
Like another wife

JAMIE
Damn you got me

Vivien laughs

VIVIEN
Keep those skeletons in the closet

Back from the dead

VIVIEN

Jamie watches her groove to the beat amused

Belting the awful lyrics Vivien grabs Jamie’s hand
serenading him

Jamie fakes a cringe

EXT HIGHWAY - DAY
Vivien’s Honda cruises past a thick forest
Like a morbid statue Louise stands near a cluster of dying
trees watching the car drive out of sight
EXT CASEY’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD - DAY

Trimmed hedges surround a large country home Decorated
walkway Brick mailbox Picture perfect

A squad car and flawless sports car sit out front

INT CASEY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
A flat screen plays a muted slasher MOVIE

An auxiliary cord connects Casey’s phone to a gigantic
speaker blasting mid-2000s rock TUNES

right at Jamie

Fuck

VIVIEN
That’s all high school is Just one
big cell for our dreams and
aspirations

horror movie

Louise steps toward the screen holding Jamie’s horrified
gaze
VIVIEN

I don’t know I work with all these

kids and it kills them it really

does The education system’s so

weak and when you combine that with

bullying peer pressure It just

makes it tough

EXT WOODS - NIGHT
A cool BREEZE whips through the towering trees
The uneasy Vivien walks amongst the high grass
ROB (VO)
(praying)
I beg of you
Vivien looks around searching for Rob
ROB (VO)
I can’t do this alone Lord

Desolate no neighbors A clean lawn Religious ornaments
decorate the yard

Vivien emerges from the forest She sees the log cabin

ROB (VO)
Forgive me Please
INT LOUISE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Decadent crucifixes hang along the walls An antique piano
rests in the corner A cozy fireplace

The muted TV plays a black-and-white film

Vivien pushes the front door open and staggers inside Her
frantic eyes scan the room but see no one

VIVIEN
Hello

She notices a portrait of Louise hanging over the fireplace
Like a starlet Louise poses in the shot looking so proper
and regal

ROB (VO)
Please Lord

Vivien journeys through the rest of the room until she steps
in something sticky

She looks down Moist blood

ROB (VO)
Look after her in Heaven

DINING ROOM

A gorgeous chandelier provides bright lighting The long
dinner table lines up two chairs seated at each end

Vivien enters her nervous steps CREAKING on the wooden
floor

She sees ROB LEWTON 44 bearded holy roller sitting at the
head of the table weeping his face turned away

ROB
Protect her

Vivien approaches him

ROB
Protect my baby girl

He lowers his hand revealing a blood-stained butcher knife

The terrified Vivien stops right next to him

ROB
That’s all Lord

Vivien reaches toward him

ROB
Protect Louise

Rob snatches her hand

VIVIEN
Oh God

He looks up at her his eyes full of despair

ROB
You’ve gotta believe me

Breaking away Vivien trips and falls to the floor

ROB
I didn’t do it

The dazed Vivien turns She screams in horror

Louise’s dead eyes stare right back at her Blood flows from
her slit throat the thick redness sliding down her body
spreading throughout her dress

Rob stands up shoving his chair back

ROB
I didn’t kill my baby

Louise leans upright Blood DRIPS off her fatal wound
SPLASHING to the floor

Vivien crawls back

VIVIEN
No

Rob glances down at the knife He clutches the wooden
handle Closes his eyes

ROB
Protect me Lord Give me strength

Louise reaches toward Vivien

Vivien stumbles to her feet and turns just avoiding
Louise’s hand

Rob YELLS and lurches forward ensnaring Vivien in his arms

VIVIEN
No

ROB
The Good Lord will look after me

Rob raises the sharp blade

ROB
He’1l look after us all

VIVIEN
No don’t do this

He THRUSTS the knife into Vivien’s stomach

ROB
Protect us Lord

She screams as he JAMS the blade into her fragile flesh over
and over

INT CASEYS HOUSE - GUEST ROOM - NIGHT

Two windows showcase the manicured lawn Casey and Sarah’s
portrait hangs over a trophy case Useless awards from the
far-too-distant past

Vivien awakens from her nightmare Breathing heavy she
checks her surroundings making sure she’s safe No Rob no
knife no Louise Vivien looks over at the sleeping Jamie
Her adrenaline dying down she notices a collection of
framed photos all of them highlighting Casey’s tenure as a
high school baseball star Some of the pics even show him

with a nerdy benchwarmer Jamie

Vivien cracks a smile

EXT ABANDONED LOT - DAY
Morning dew drips from the trees
Crime scene tape surrounds the scene

A couple of police cars sit nearby Several OFFICERS
investigate

PARAMEDICS load Chris’s corpse into an ambulance

Standing in the middle of the yard KANE THORNTON 55 jaded
sheriff glances over at Officer JASON EARLE 25 smartass
newbie

Like an arrogant photographer Jason takes pictures of the
blood-stained grass having more fun than he should

KANE
(in disbelief)
Completely naked

Not missing a beat Jason leans in for a closer shot

JASON
Yes sir Naked as a jaybird

KANE
Jesus Christ

Jason faces him
JASON
I got the glass in the car if you

wanna see

Kane holds up his hand and steps away heading for his car

KANE
No thanks Jason I think I’ve had
enough

JASON

Suit yourself Sheriff

Kane opens the door He looks off toward the dirt road lost
in thought

Jason inspects more blood spatter Like a grisly finger
painting the splashes of redness spread all across the
unkempt lawn

JASON
Yes sir I ain’t ever heard of no
man getting naked before offing
himself

He holds the camera steady
Kane remains quiet an uneasy expression on his face
JASON

Maybe a woman I wouldn’t mind no
crime scene like that now

Forcing a laugh Jason takes another shot
JASON
Maybe next time y’all can call me
for one of them bathtub suicides--

An engine CRANKS interrupting Jason He turns and watches
Kane PULL AWAY

INT CASEYS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Afternoon Sarah all dressed for the reunion cleans up the
coffee table She CRUSHES a beer can

Wearing a fresh blazer Casey clutches a longneck and leans
against the wall watching her

SARAH
I told you to quit

CASEY
Yeah well it’s called stress
Maybe if you worked you’d
understand
The lackadaisical Casey takes a sip
SARAH
The police officer in a hick town
So stressful and important
Sarah slings the can inside the trash bin

GUEST ROOM

Vivien sits in front of the dresser mirror putting on
her make-up

Jamie steps away
JAMIE

Vivien stands and approaches him

VIVIEN
I could tell it was bothering you

JAMIE

It had nothing to do with that

Vivien grabs his arm

VIVIEN
I know how hard it’s been Jamie

Jamie breaks away from her grasp

JAMIE
Not anymore I’ve moved on

VIVIEN
Jamie

JAMIE
Look just what are you trying to
say You think I’ve got some
kind’ve fucked-up mommy complex or
something

VIVIEN
No Babe people react to these
things in different ways It’s part
of the grieving process

JAMIE
Awesome The great Dr Vivien
Dahlgren heals her husband

VIVIEN
I’m not saying it’d have to be with
me but there’s nothing wrong with
talking to somebody Jamie Society
gives it such a stigma but it’s
normal

Jamie scoffs

VIVIEN
I promise it can help if you’d just
give it a chance Whatever feelings
you have you can be at peace with
them

Trying to downplay the topic Jamie caresses Vivien’s face

JAMIE
Vivien I love you and I know
you’re just trying to help but I’m
not one of your patients I’m fine

VIVIEN
Just keep it in mind will you
Please For me
JAMIE
Alright I’11 think about it
about that
Vivien wraps her arms around him

VIVIEN
That’s all I’m asking

They kiss Jamie smirks
JAMIE
Why Dr Dahlgren anyway Why
not Dr Tracy

Vivien laughs

VIVIEN
Don’t tell me you’re jealous

Maybe a little

He reaches inside his suit pocket

restless

Jamie notices his despondency

Vivien sings along to the lyrics trying to drown out their
bickering

The impressed Sarah listens an audience of one

SARAH

She high-fives Vivien

Casey holds his hand in the air pretending to be a drunk
rock fan An easy acting job for him

Vivien turns and sees Jamie looking out the window
disappointed to not see him join in on the jovial fun

The old high school lurks up ahead A deep forest surrounds
the crumbling two-story building Dirt and dying grass
conquer what was once a paved driveway and parking lot
Egg stains plaster the dilapidated brick sign Whigham High
Casey points at the school as they pass by

reception as he leads her toward one of the decorated
tables Wine bottles snack bowls
They stop at the end of the line
An ICY BLONDE and her LESS ATTRACTIVE FRIEND stand at the
front of the table They see Jamie both of them reacting
quick and snatching their drinks

wrong path for awhile

Like an aggressive detective Al looks right into Jamie’s
eyes

AL
Like a lot of us

Across the room SCRAWNY FEMALE waves Al over
Jamie and Vivien notice her waves becoming more desperate

AL
Excuse me

He walks toward Scrawny Female leaving Jamie and Vivien as
the lone attendees at the table

wine

Vivien sees Al and Scrawny Female watching them

wine

Tall grass rampant weeds The abandoned cabin still
remains a shell of its former self

Shattered windows Torn crime scene tape surrounds the
busted-open doorway

Kane’s squad car parks near the porch He steps out An
empty twelve-pack rests on the floorboard

Raising his flashlight he makes his way toward the home

INT LOUISE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Crooked crucifixes line up along the walls some of them
lying on the floor The lonely piano its keys long broken
stands near the busted TV

Obscene carvings and spray-painted graffiti decorate the
walls phrases like KILLER SICK FUCK and BURN IN HELL
Empty longnecks pile up in the decrepit fireplace

Kane enters

He aims his flashlight through the rest of the room
illuminating cobwebs dusty candles and religious statues

The beam hits the portrait of Louise Her picture’s
beautiful eyes stare right at Kane

Kane catches a chill He notices a bedroom door in a narrow
hallway

The piano KEYS play on their own startling him

KANE
Shit

The MUSIC stops Kane turns and looks back at the portrait
He trembles terrified

The picture now features a decomposing Louise Blood flows
from her eyes dripping all down her face

KANE

His trigger finger shaking Kane steps toward the bedroom
door

Antique furniture Cobwebs dangle from the ceiling Spiders
scurry across the peeling wallpaper

A canopy bed sits in the center of the room Torn curtains
encircle the large bed disguising whatever lurks inside

Chris’s camcorder rests on top of a monstrous dresser its
lens pointed right at the bed

And brought me home safely to my
family
Kane walks inside clinging to his flashlight and pistol

Kane traces Louise’s voice to the bed

LOUISE (VO)
Thank you Father

As Kane reaches toward the curtains his flashlight cuts
out Total darkness He stops panicking

KANE
Goddammit

LOUISE (VO)
I love you Amen

Louise’s pale hand emerges from the curtains snatching
Kane’s wrist

Nerves ravage his psyche He staggers back Drops the
flashlight

KANE
No Let go

The curtains part revealing the gorgeous Louise She stands
up

Kane looks right into her ominous eyes He stops fighting
back giving in to her

The flashlight cuts on its beam so vivid and bright
Louise lets go

Gazing at her Kane unbuttons his shirt He strips down to
his bare skin Sits on the SQUEAKY mattress

Louise watches Kane jam the pistol upward into his mouth
Without remorse Kane PULLS the trigger

Like water exploding from a whale’s spout the bullet SHOOTS
OUT the top of Kane’s head

Blood and grue decorate the curtains Kane slumps back

Louise glares down at his corpse nothing but contempt in
her eyes

The camcorder’s red light goes out

Sarah lets go of the doorknob letting the door creep open

SARAH
Casey

The group walk inside Sarah illuminating the office with
her flashlight Casey isn’t there

VIVIEN
Shit where is he

Sarah notices the pinned headlines She stares at one
horrified

The bold font Louise Lewton Declared Dead The Search For
Her Body Continues

Underneath it rests a small black-and-white photo of Louise
Her sophomore picture

SARAH
Yall come here

VIVIEN
What is it

Her and Jamie see the clipping
JAMIE
(scared)
Louise
Sarah moves the light toward the other clippings All of
them detail the same report Louise’s death The

disappearance of her body

A stack of photos and articles SLIDE off the desk scaring
the friends

VIVIEN
Oh God

Sarah leads Vivien to the spot

Jamie looks at the wall staring at a photo of Louise The
picture shows her standing beneath a large tree Her dress
looks brand new not torn and ragged

Sarah grabs a clipping off the desk

The headline Rob Lewton Found Dead Suicide By Hanging

Sarah covers her mouth horrified

Vivien stares at Rob’s photo His scruffy beard and wild
eyes

VIVIEN
Casey wouldn’t do this would he

SARAH
I don’t know

The trembling Sarah drops the article

SARAH
I don’t think so

Jamie sees another picture of Louise In the shot an
eight-year-old Louise holds a puppy

SARAH
He wouldn’t just leave us like
this He’d at least show up and
laugh at us

Vivien rummages through the other articles She glances at
different photos of Rob with Louise

VIVIEN
All these pictures and articles He
couldn’t have
Jamie looks back at the outdoor picture
Louise now stands a few feet away from the tree closer
toward the camera A harsh glare replaces her neutral
expression

Jamie stumbles back

JAMIE
Fuck

The startled Vivien and Sarah turn and look at him

VIVIEN
Jamie

Jamie faces them
JAMIE
It’s Louise It’s her She’s doing

this

SARAH
She’s dead

JAMIE
I don’t know but she’s here She’s
been following us this whole time

VIVIEN
Babe she couldn’t have

The disturbed Jamie turns He look at the tree picture
again His eyes go wide in fear

Louise is gone

JAMIE
Aw God

VIVIEN
Jamie

A cold hand snags Jamie’s shoulder

He whirls around

Louise

Jamie stares into her haunting eyes She leans in closer
The worried Vivien and Sarah look on They only see Jamie

SARAH
What’s he doing

The photographs and articles FLY off the desk

VIVIEN
Shit

Vivien and Sarah panic They rush toward Jamie

Nails and tacks POP out releasing the headlines and
pictures

Vivien pushes Jamie out of the room helping him evade
Louise

VIVIEN
Go

He turns and glimpses back Louise is no longer there

The desk SLIDES across the room

The outdoor picture now lies on the floor Louise is back in
it standing closer toward the camera a vivid slice running
across her neck

MAIN HALLWAY

Jamie Sarah and Vivien leave the office Vivien SLAMMING
the door behind them

SARAH
What the Hell happened back there

Sarah staggers around desperate

SARAH
Goddammit Casey

Vivien looks at the quiet Jamie

VIVIEN
Jamie what is this

JAMIE

VIVIEN
They said she’s dead

JAMIE
She’s alive

The weary Sarah leans against a locker

VIVIEN
Jamie it’s--

From further down the hall rapid FOOTSTEPS charge toward
them
VIVIEN
Oh God

Sarah stands up She points her flashlight that way
for the culprit

SARAH
Casey

A door SWINGS open on its own
Sarah jumps back

SARAH
Shit

The flashlight cuts out

SARAH
Oh God No

Sarah hits the back of her flashlight No use
Vivien rushes toward the door Jamie grabs her arm

JAMIE
Vivien don’t

VIVIEN
Jamie let go

She breaks away
The FOOSTEPS sound louder closer

LIBRARY

looking

A torn carpet spreads across the floor Crammed bookshelves
gather dust Old computers sit on top of wooden counters

Vivien steps inside Jamie and Sarah following in behind

her

VIVIEN
Casey

They stop near the front counter
JAMIE

Yall let’s get the fuck outta
here We can come back--

SARAH
Shut the fuck up Jamie

The door SHUTS behind them Jamie turns around

JAMIE
Fuck this

He grabs Vivien’s arm

JAMIE
Let’s go

Vivien pulls away

VIVIEN
Wait

Sarah points across the room

SARAH
There he is

Sitting on the couch Casey looks straight ahead turned
away from them

A long table stands in front of him Chris’s camcorder rests
on top of a sofa sitting across from the couch Casey
occupies The camera’s red light glows its lens pointed
right at Casey

SARAH
Casey

Casey continues ignoring them

VIVIEN
What’s he doing

Sarah charges toward him

SARAH
Stop it Casey

Vivien follows her
The hesitant Jamie waits behind

JAMIE
Something’s not right

Sarah stops near the couch She jumps back startled Drops
her flashlight

The nude Casey sits on the sofa He looks on at the
camcorder his eyes blank

SARAH
Jesus Casey

Vivien stops next to her

VIVIEN
Oh God

Sarah grabs Casey’s arm

SARAH
What the Hell are you doing

He doesn’t move refusing to face her
Jamie snatches the locked door handle No way out

JAMIE
Fuck

Sarah shakes Casey

SARAH
Casey look at me

Casey shoves her to the floor

VIVIEN
Sarah

The helpless Sarah looks on as Casey stands up
Vivien leans down next to Sarah holding her close

Jamie watches Casey FLIP the table upside-down Three metal
legs jut out

JAMIE
Shit

Jamie runs toward him

JAMIE
Casey

Casey turns around confronting the group

Jamie comes to a stop a few feet away from him

SARAH
Casey It’s me

Casey falls back onto one of the table legs The metal
slides up his ass SPLATTERING blood over his naked body
He remains quiet despondent No sense of panic

VIVIEN
Oh God

Covering her mouth Sarah turns away horrified

Like a javelin the metal leg protrudes through his crotch
Casey grabs at it his eyes lacking emotion

The camcorder records Casey convulsing Blood and saliva
pour out of his mouth

JAMIE
God

Jamie watches him go still

SARAH
Casey

The camcorder turns off by itself
Jamie faces Vivien and Sarah

JAMIE
I told y’all

VIVIEN
Jamie no

JAMIE
It’s Louise

VIVIEN
Stop this

JAMIE
I’m not crazy Goddammit

LOUISE (VO)

JAMIE

The confused Vivien helps Sarah stand up
VIVIEN
Hear what

Terrified Jamie searches for Louise

JAMIE
Where is she

VIVIEN
Jamie she’s not here

A computer CUTS on

JAMIE
Shit

He stumbles toward it
A video plays on the screen

VIVIEN

Jamie stops in front of the monitor He recognizes the
footage The abandoned lot

Different screens all turn on The same video The abandoned
lot

Sarah points Vivien toward the monitors

SARAH
Look

Jamie faces the computers horrified

JAMIE
No You can’t do this to me

Vivien and Sarah stop in front of the closest monitor
their curiosity overpowering them

Jamie leans against a wall He turns away defeated

ON SCREEN - ABANDONED LOT - NIGHT
Ten years ago The same yard where Chris killed himself
Teenage Chris’s truck sits parked in the middle of the lot

Longnecks and cans litter the ground Crushed joints and
cigarettes scatter across the truck’s hood

Standing a few feet away Teenage Jamie 18 watches Teenage
Casey 18 drag Louise to the ground

Teenage Casey cackles while groping Louise like a savage
She struggles unable to break free

TEENAGE CHRIS 18 stands further away recording the act
with his camcorder

Cigarette ashes and beer stains cover the boys’ graduation
gowns

LOUISE
No Let me go

TEENAGE CASEY
Shush baby

Teenage Chris chuckles behind the camera

TEENAGE CHRIS

his rough touch

Teenage Casey retrieves Louise’s thong

TEENAGE CASEY

The excited Teenage Casey watches Teenage Jamie climb on top
of Louise

TEENAGE CASEY
It’s showtime

TEENAGE CHRIS

Louise closes her eyes and turns away

The eager Teenage Casey and Teenage Chris gear up to watch
the show

Teenage Jamie thrusts against Louise over and over Louise
cringes the pain unbearable

Teenage Chris steps forward for a close-up

Like a demented teammate Teenage Casey pats Teenage Jamie
on the back offering support

TEENAGE CASEY
You got this Jamie You’re the
fucking man bro

BACK TO PRESENT DAY

INT OLD HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - NIGHT

The footage keeps rolling Teenage Jamie collapses on top of
the petrified Louise breathing heavy

Horrified Vivien and Sarah turn to Jamie
VIVIEN
(disgusted)
You sick fuck

She charges toward Jamie

VIVIEN
What the Hell’s wrong with you

Jamie faces her ashamed Tears well up in his eyes

JAMIE
I’m sorry

Vivien hits Jamie in the face knocking him back against the
wall

VIVIEN
How could y’all fucking do that

JAMIE
I’m sorry Vivien--

VIVIEN
You sick bastard
SARAH
Both of y’all hid this from us
JAMIE
They made me I couldn’t tell
anyone
SARAH

That doesn’t make it right
asshole

JAMIE
She tried going to the Sheriff
but the fucker He covered it up

Bitter tears stream down Vivien’s face
JAMIE

He didn’t do a Goddamn thing

Covered it all up for Casey

Vivien snatches her necklace off

VIVIEN
You bastard

She hurls the necklace at Jamie hitting him in the head

VIVIEN
You sick fuck

Jamie turns and looks away

JAMIE
(ashamed )
I don’t even know if her dad did
it Sheriff smeared him for us
made sure they got him Kept that
whole Goddamn family quiet forever

SARAH
Yall are fucking sick All of
yall

Jamie confronts them tears sliding down his cheeks

JAMIE
I’m sorry

SARAH
She didn’t have a chance

JAMIE
I know Goddammit I know

The monitors cut away from the rape footage A new clip
appears Louise in her living room

Vivien notices the change

VIVIEN
Oh God

They all watch the footage

JAMIE
Louise

Louise stares at the camera her eyes looking right at
Jamie Her pale hand raises the butcher knife

Tears flowing from her eyes Vivien covers her mouth

VIVIEN
No

Without hesitation Louise slides the blade over her
jugular Blood SPURTS out hitting the lens

Vivien looks away

VIVIEN
Oh God

All the while Jamie watches the graphic clip haunted by
the video

JAMIE
We did it We caused her to die

Sarah hits his shoulder enraged

SARAH
Goddamn you

Jamie backs away

A surveillance video plays on the monitors A naked Rob in
his cell Shedding tears he stands up on the cot Fastens
the noose around his neck

Sarah watches mortified

JAMIE
No This can’t be happening

Rob hops off the bed the noose SNAPPING his neck instantly
His nude corpse SWAYS back-and-forth

SARAH
Jesus

Sarah stumbles toward Vivien Vivien holds her both of them
keeping their distance from Jamie

Various suicide clips now play at a rapid rate Chris Kane
Casey Louise’s victims

SARAH
It’s all cause of y’all

Jamie bumps into the counter He touches the surface
cutting his hand

Sarah lunges toward him barely restrained by Vivien

SARAH
Fucking pigs

VIVIEN
Sarah

Jamie looks down at the counter
Louise’s butcher knife

Jamie grabs the wooden handle Blood drips from the sharp
blade

JAMIE
No

Vivien and Sarah stare at the knife the weapon making them
uneasy

VIVIEN
Jamie

Jamie turns and faces them

VIVIEN
Don’t do this

Jamie looks back at the monitor The suicide video loop

JAMIE
I’m sorry

Heavy books TUMBLE off the shelves startling Sarah

SARAH
Oh fuck

LOUISE (VO)
Jamie

Jamie glances around the library trying to find Louise

JAMIE
Louise

The unnerved Vivien watches him stumble around

LOUISE (VO)

Jamie

SARAH
He’s flipped out He’s fucking
psycho

VIVIEN

They all have
Louise repeats Jamie’s name creating an eerie chant
Jamie stops and checks a computer screen

The monitor now shows footage from the library Jamie
staring at the screen

JAMIE
Aw fuck

Vivien and Sarah notice the live video

VIVIEN
What the Hell

His eyes glued to the screen Jamie watches Louise emerge
from the corner shadows gliding toward him

JAMIE
Aw God

Jamie whirls around

Louise waits behind him Her unwavering glare holds his
gaze She looks glorious

JAMIE
Louise

Jamie backs away Louise following him step-for-step
Vivien and Sarah glance at a monitor

They watch Jamie sit on the sofa across from Casey’s corpse
Neither of them see Louise

Sarah’s flashlight cuts on illuminating Jamie like a morbid
spotlight

The camcorder switches on by itself turning on its own to
point right at Jamie

Louise approaches him her movements so effortless

Panicking he looks up at her Nowhere to run

JAMIE
You bitch

Jamie swings the knife and slices Louise’s chest cutting
through her dress A stream of black blood oozes out

JAMIE
Aw God

Louise stands still her glare even more ominous

JAMIE
Why Why are you doing this

He slams his fist against the sofa

JAMIE
You didn’t have to kill yourself

The angry Jamie turns away

JAMIE
Goddammit we don’t deserve to die

A baby’s CRIES erupt

JAMIE
Aw God

Jamie looks for the infant

JAMIE
What the fuck was that

The unsettling CRIES grow louder and louder

JAMIE
What the fuck

Louise’s abdomen THROBS
Jamie jumps back He stares at it mortified

JAMIE
No No Louise

He looks up at Louise his eyes pleading

JAMIE
I’m sorry Goddammit I’m sorry

Tears stream down his face

JAMIE
I did murder you

The hidden presence in Louise’s abdomen PULSATES again and
again each THROB more intense than the last

Louise reaches toward Jamie

JAMIE
Our child

Giving him a slight nod Louise grabs the back of Jamie’s
head drawing him in closer toward her abdomen

Jamie looks up at Louise greeted by her harsh glare His
eyes go blank Emotionless

The baby’s monstrous WHINES become shriller as Louise’s
abdomen rots and falls apart

A gruesome FETUS BURSTS out of her stomach

The gory organism drips vivid goo It reaches out with tiny
claw-like hands its underdeveloped eyes targeting Jamie

Bellowing murky CRIES the fetus’s claws latch onto Jamie
digging in deep through his tender flesh

Razor-sharp teeth emerge from the baby’s disjointed mouth

The flashlight beam showcases the baby’s fangs sinking into
Jamie’s neck

Blood SPLATTERS over the walls and floor A vicious feast

Louise watches the attack a gratified expression on her
face

The camcorder films away positioned at a perfect angle

Vivien and Sarah stare at Jamie both of them disgusted by
the sight

They don’t see Louise or the baby Instead they only see
the naked Jamie holding Louise’s butcher knife Multiple
stab wounds cover his crotch his penis severed A rough
self-castration Blood everywhere

The library door CREAKS open

The dying Jamie holds his hand out toward Vivien

JAMIE
Vivien

Sarah grabs Vivien’s arm

SARAH
Come on

JAMIE
(weak)
No

Spurning him Vivien turns away

JAMIE
Please

The weakened Jamie lowers his hand

Together Vivien and Sarah exit the library leaving the
massacre behind

Leaning down Jamie shuts his eyes Blood DRIPS from his
lifeless body

Flowing blood oozes toward the dying flashlight The redness
collides with the flickering beam before the light finally
cuts out Darkness suffocates the scene

FADE OUT

THE END
