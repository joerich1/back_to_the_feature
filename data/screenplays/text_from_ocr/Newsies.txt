Not the customer price -- the
price to the distribution

Pulitzer looks to Seitz for a translation
SEITZ
You mean the Newsies Charge
the Newsies more for their papers
Bad idea Chief
JONATHAN
Very well My next proposal --
salary cuts particularly those
at the very top --
PULITZER
Wait What do the Newsies pay
now -- fifty cents per hundred
papers If you raised it to
sixty cents --

JONATHAN
A mere tenth of a cent per paper --

PULITZER
-- then that multiplied by forty
thousand papers a day seven days
a week -- well it would pay some
of the bills around here

SEITZ
Chief if you do this every
Newsie we got will head straight
for Hearst

5191 BLUE 36

PULITZER
Not necessarily As newspapermen
Hearst and I would cut each others
throats to get the best of the
other But as businessmen -- and
gentlemen -- we often agree on
ways to keep down certain operating
costs If I know Willie Hearst
hes going to wish he thought of
this himself

What about the other papers --

From behind some rotting timbers steps a freckled gnome
He looks them up and down then grins He is SPOT
CONLON

SPOT

If it aint Jack be nimble Jack
be quick

Jack meets his challenging grin with one of his own

JACK
Youre movin up in the world
Spot -- got a ocean view and
everything
Spot and Jack exchange heh-hehs Davids getting more
nervous
SPOT

So Im hearin things from little
birdies in Harlem and Queens and

JACK
(unintimidated)
Its a mouth with a brain -- and
if you got half-a-one youll

David looks at Jack wide-eyed Me Scared to death

he starts -- as Spots henchmen begin circling him like
jackals
DAVID
Uh we started the strike but
we cant do it alone so weve
been talkin to Newsies all over
the city

SPOT

So they told me And what did
they tell you
David looks nervously at the circling henchmen

DAVID
That theyre all waiting to see
what Spot Conlon does That youre

the key

(as Spot puffs

himself up David

sees an opening)

That Spot Conlon is the most
respected and famous newsie
in New York and probably
everywhere else

Spot signals the henchmen to stop circling waits for
more lapping it up

DAVID
And if Spot Conlon joins the
strike theyll join and well be
unstoppable so you gotta join and

well you gotta
He trails off Spot nods turns to Jack
SPOT
Youre right Brains
(hardens)
But I got brains too -- and more

than half-a-one How do I know
you punks wont run the first
time some goon comes atcha with
a club How do I know youre in

relief -- but Jack suddenly grabs a rope hanging from
the wharf and swings in front of Spot

JACK

Maybe you lost your guts Spotty-

boy --
(as Spot freezes)

-- or maybe you traded em to some

chicken for that beak of yours

(in Spots face)

Maybe you gotta show me you aint

afraid to join the strike

Murders in the air David and Boots are paralyzed
the henchmen are ready to explode Spots eyes are
locked on Jacks for an excruciating moment -- then

Hes waving the bedsheet with the scowling devil-mask of
Joe P painted on it Jack smiles as Crutchy parades
with the banner the other Newsies begin to notice
Across the square Denton lounges with his notebook
studying the Newsies as if he too were concerned about
how serious they are

David watches Crutchy parading with the bedsheet other

Newsies put aside their marbles hoops etc and watch

cornering some Newsies by the wagons Theyre raising
their clubs when --

poking at them with his crutch --
