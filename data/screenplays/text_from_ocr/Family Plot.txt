BLANCHE (0S) - Thank you

JULIA - And why did I force my sister
to give the child away

BLANCHE - I guess the kid was a
illegitimate

BLANCHE (0S) - Miss Rainbird

JULIA - I dont want you to think me
a puritan Madame Blanche but
forty years ago an unmarried
mother was not the commonplace
it is nowdays And in a family
like ours a scandal had to be

covered up at all costs

BLANCHE - I understand

JULIA - And Im still sufficiently
old-fashioned

JULIA (0S) - and sufficiently
protective of the Rainbird name
to want to seek some missing heir

JULIA - in a private and secret
fashion rather than go to
detective agencies and put notices
in the newspapers

BLANCHE - A most wise decision
