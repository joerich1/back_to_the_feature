they ascend and finally disappear The music shifts
in mood and momentum RAVEN breaks her laser

bonds steps out of her platform and moves into an
astonishing dance precisely choreographed to the
music and the lyrics The dance defies physical
endurance at one moment and is cool and graceful

of laughter

INT LEAR JET - CITY AIRPORT NIGHT

RAVEN is at the controls of the jet PAUL is in the
luxurious main cabin opening a bottle of expensive
champagne He fills two glasses and staggers tipsily
toward RAVEN who is wearing the same outfit she wore
at Les Copains RAVEN is pushing buttons and speaking
into a mike

RAVEN
You can beam me up Scotty

RAVEN sees a key Turns it A high whining sound

(contd)

PAUL

PAUL rushes over spilling champagne He almost trips
as he turns the key off She laughs and sways into
the cabin area PAUL smiling walks back toward her
She fills up his half-empty glass

RAVEN fishes in her pink tote bag Puts on her new
show tape MUSIC starts slowly almost melodic PAUL
sits in a swivel chair as RAVEN begins her impromptu

dance

As the MUSIC builds she moves with an implicit

grace immediatly creating a theatrical atmosphere
She throws off her bowler hat Snaps off her forties
jacket revealing her breasts Shes also wearing long

(contd)

black silk gloves with the fingers cut off Fingernail
polish sparkles in the light Shes wearing no under-
wear beneath the mauve leotards MUSIC shifts its
momentum to hard rock RAVEN turns the volume up

full blast The music is deafening She dances

out the door of the jet PAUL broken from his
reverie follows her

EXT LEAR JET - DOCKING AREA - CITY AIRPORT - NIGHT

RAVEN is now rocking topless and in extremely high
heels on the wing of the LEAR JET From the tarmack
PAUL stares at this creature abandoning herself to the
music

EXT NEARBY HANGAR - CITY AIRPORT NIGHT

A black SCURITY GUARD in his sixties turns his head
toward the sound of the music as do THREE JANITORS
who are cleaning up One JANITOR recognizes where the
music is coming from Turns to SECURITY GUARD

JANITOR
Its from dock area 21

The SECURITY GUARD presses button 21 of a lighting
switchboard mounted on the hangar wall The LEAR JET
is hit by a spotlight The JANITORS and SECURITY
GUARD are amazed at the sight of a girl dancing wildly
on the wing of the plane They move toward the plane
in a rush A MAN driving a fork lift loading vehicle
also catches the sight as does an AIRPLANE MECHANIC
carrying a large wrench in his hand dressed in greasy
overalls They all move toward the plane providing an
audience suspending disbelief The group circles the
front of the plane RAVEN ignores them and pushes her
extreme dance even further moving up to the roof of
the jet PAUL the FORK LIFT OPERATOR AIRPLANE
MECHANIC SECURITY GUARD and THREE JANITORS gradually
get into the spirit of the music moving their own
bodies to the beat They love it A 747 JUMBO JET is
starting to taxi down the nearby take off strip
The huge jet passes RAVEN in the spotlight on the smaller
Plane CAMERA PANS past the long line of portholes on
the 747 as it passes RAVEN FACES pressed to the windows
of the 747 show a whole range of emotions as they stare
s down at the girl and her audience The 747
passes by speeds toward takeoff The MUSIC moves to
another mood and RAVEN dances down the wing to the
entrance steps and into the jet PAUL obsessed
rushes after her and slams the door Looks of dis-
Appcintment on the faces of the new audience

INT LEAR JET DOCKING AREA CITY AIRPORT - NIGHT

RAVEN poses to the last beats of the music Her body
is running with perspiration Her last theatrical
gesture is to place her hand between her legs as her
head shoots upward PAUL moves slowly toward her
Places his hands on her face Tenderly touches her
features Moves his hands down her neck slowly
falls to his knees moves down across her breasts
even more slowly down toward her navel Hes
trembling Begins to pull down the leotards slowly
RAVEN opens her eyes Looks down at PAUL A moment

of indecision Finally reaches down and holds his hand

RAVEN ’
Pauldont

PAUL pulls RAVEN to her knees Kisses her roughly
on the mouth She reponds They roll together on
the floor Frantic passion Finally RAVEN wrestles

(contd)

RAVEN hurls herself at PAUL Her fists pummeling him
Hes 50 surprised by her attack that he bounces off

a wall and falls to the floor Furious she straddles
him and pushes his face between her legs

Is that it

RAVEN bursts into tears Gets up Grabs her things
Rushes out of the plane PAUL stunned remorseful
