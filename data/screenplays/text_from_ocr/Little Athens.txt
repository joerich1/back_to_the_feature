STORY SYNOPSIS An edgy multi-storied dark comedy about a single day in the lives of an ensemble of
Gen-Y’s

EMILY Hair past her shoulders Emily is adorably cute and very well endowed especially for a
fifteen year-old Corey’s younger sister Target of Pedro’s persistent cradle-rocking passes She is
essentially on the run with Corey from an extremely abusive father who we find out at the end has been
severely beating her STRONG SUPPORTING

CARTER Confident and tough with a modestly athletic build he’s throwing a big party at his house
where all of the main characters converge Low-maintenance with an appetite for greasy food and cheap
beer he’s a guy’s guy and has an easy banter with girls He had a fling with Jessica in the past but has
little patience for her bs although he reluctantly offers to step in and protect her from Aaron STRONG
SUPPORTING

BUGGERIN’ BOBBY BALES (Early 20s) Enormous steroid-inflated bookie who is built like an NFL
linebacker with a habit of walking around the locker room naked The rumors fly around town about
“Bobby the Bookie” and his soft-spoken gentle manner doesn’t seem to contradict what is being said He
won’t hesitate to scrap if he’s confronted but he doesn’t have a chip on his shoulder STRONG
SUPPORTING

KATIE (7-10) A plain-looking 7 year-old girl who is precocious and small for her age She perceives a lot
more than most 7 year-olds and peppers her negligent babysitter with questions She must be very good
with dialogue and extremely perceptive STRONG SUPPORTING

INT JERRYS HOUSE JERRYS BEDROOM -- MORNING

The room is dark and messy JERRY a soft unshaven boy of about
eighteen years sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t-
shirt He has not quite woken up yet

Jerry pulls a huge well-traveled SUITCASE from his closet and
tosses it onto the bed He begins grabbing articles of CLOTHING
from the closet and tossing them into the Suitcase

INT JERRYS HOUSE KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

Jerry is in his kitchen which is no brighter than his bedroom and
not much cleaner Jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and
jelly SANDWICH He chews mechanically washing it down with a can
of SODA His lazy mind is somewhere else

INT JERRYS HOUSE BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Jerry gargles with a generic brand of MOUTHWASH and spits into the
sink

He catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror - he
is not very attractive He grabs his TOOTHBRUSH and RAZOR and
exits the bathroom

INT JERRYS HOUSE JERRYS BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

The room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets a
naked pillow a beat-up dresser with a small TV on top of it an old
POGO STICK propped against the wall near the GARBAGE CAN at the foot
of the bed and a few posters and scraps of trash Jerry tosses his
Toothbrush and Razor into his Suitcase next to a VIDEO GAME CONSOLE
and several VIDEO GAMES on top of which lies GRAND THEFT AUTO III
He has pitifully few belongings He shuts the Suitcase

INT JERRYS HOUSE LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

The living room is also a mess - the place is either a pig sty or a
house full of bachelors Jerry now in sweatpants and sneakers but
still wearing the same t-shirt that he slept in carries his
Suitcase through the foyer to the front door He about-faces to
look at the interior of his home He will not miss it

He turns to open the screen door - its stuck He fiddles with
handle until the screen door opens He exits letting the screen
door slam shut behind him

EXT POOL -- MORNING

The slender white board extends majestically over the glistening
blue water PEDRO an unshowered pot-bellied Hispanic about
twenty-three years of age and wearing cut-off jean shorts is
standing at the end of the board looking down at the water below as
if expecting an invitation COREY a late teenager covered with
tattoos with twigs for arms and legs lies against the hard
concrete while inserting the pool VACUUM HOSE into one of the many
pool skimmer drains Pedro begins to bounce on the board - up
down up down Pedro launches forth as if the water called out to
him and but for his want of grace the entry would be poetic
Instead Pedros dive is as clumsy as it is painful

COREY
Nice

PEDRO
Fuck you conjo This is my shower

COREY
Maybe back in Mexico thats a shower in
Athens thats just dirty

PEDRO
Clean the pool conjo clean the pool

COREY

Pedro smiles as he paddles away from Corey starting to enjoy his
morning swim A PAYPHONE hanging on the pool house starts ringing
Corey drops the Vacuum and runs toward the Payphone In the
background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly

stretches out her arm to silence it

to the concrete sidewalk below Her mothers voice continues to
pour forth from the Answering Machine

thought

the weight of Katie bearing down on her They reach their
destination - a rickety old merry-go-round Jessica turns her back
to the merry-go-round allowing Katie to step onto it

JESSICA (CONTD)
Hold on tight or youll get hurt

Katie grabs a handle as Jessica begins to spin the machine Katie
sails around happily as Jessica steps back to watch Katies
youthful enthusiasm lulling Jessica into a nostalgic gloom

place her on the Backboard Heather is a bit rough

HARRY (CONTD)

the two say nothing They place the Victim into the back of the
Ambulance as Heather looks on

The Ambulance is moving along a near-empty single-lane road at a
patient pace with two CARS tailgating behind it

INT AMBULANCE -- CONTINUOUS

Allison and Harry are in the back with the Victim and Heather is

again behind the wheel moving her head ever so slightly as if to
music playing in her head Heathers moderate driving speed is in
sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene
At the same red light that Heather recklessly ran earlier Heather

stops and looks in all directions before proceeding even though
there are no cars at the intersection

towers easily over his peers In his powerful hands he holds a tiny
notepad on which he scribbles as his clients eagerly place their

SINJIN a young African-American male about RJs age with an
average build sharply dressed in a button-down and sport coat
Sinjin has his back to Jimmy and is bouncing up and down on a rusty
old POGO STICK - his behavior constituting a sharp contrast to his
stylish threads LOUIE an overweight slobbish Caucasian male a
few years older than Sinjin sits in a rickety old WHEELCHAIR that
might creak even more than Sinjins pogo stick - in Louies lap
rests a BOWLING BALL BAG Upon seeing Sinjin and Louie Jimmy
fondles his WATER BOTTLE nervously He turns around to watch RJ
closing the door behind them
