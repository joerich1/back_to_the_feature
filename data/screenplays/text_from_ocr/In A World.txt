EXT APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

A HANDSOME MAN lounges at the base of an apple tree The
tableau is serene Picturesque An APPLE falls landing next
to him Smiling he reaches for it Polishing it on his
shirt he takes a big bite

As he chews a wide grin creeps across his face and --

-- the END CREDITS roll

WIDEN OUT to reveal this is a movie at a theater

ETHAN HAYES(20’s) watches the rather mundane film transfixed
to the screen Average in many ways he’s an everyday run-of-
the-mill guy except for the forlorn look in his eyes

EXT METROVILLE - MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

The lighted Marquee displays the movie’s title “CAREFREE
DAYS” Just beneath it the exit door slowly opens as Ethan

peers outside He looks concerned Worried

Metroville hustles and bustles with activity its citizens jam-
pack the sidewalks enjoying a night out on the town

The coast looks clear

Satisfied Ethan ventures outside He makes it five feet when
suddenly a LOUD ROAR erupts to Ethan’s left as --

-- an enormous TROLL-LIKE MONSTER bursts through the crowd

The creature is pursued by an ELITE ARMY FORCE utilizing hi-
tech weaponry

ELITE FORCE COMMANDER
Take him down Rimshot

Ethan watches in stunned silence as one of the teammates
whips out a suped-up crossbow and fires toward the beast A
metallic net explodes from the weapon slamming into the
creature

Tangled up in the web-like net the monster stumbles then
crashes into a nearby FOOD CART right next to Ethan

FOOD CART VENDOR
Hey waddaya do-eeng She’s a my
branda new food cart
ELITE FORCE COMMANDER
Sabre finish him off

The female of the squad subdues the creature with a well
placed tranquilizer dart rendering it unconscious

As the Elite Force gets rousing applause from the relieved
crowd Ethan shakes his head in incredulous disbelief

ETHAN (VO)
I wish life could be normal just like
in that movie I just saw Where
nothing special ever happens and
people go about their day without
crazy stuff happening all the time

(beat)

Unfortunately that’s just not possible
when I live

“IN A WORLD”

FADE TO

INT ETHAN’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING
Yawning and stretching Ethan rolls out of bed

On his nightstand sits a small SNOWGLOBE Within the cloud of
swirling iridescent liquid is a miniature country farmhouse
The tableau is serene and idyllic

As he heads to the shower he flicks on the TV

NEWSCASTER (ON THE TV)
Criminals have taken hostages at
Metroville Airport but Federal Agent
Trent Evans is on the case thanks to
President Baker

On the screen a heavily armed TRENT EVANS(30s) grasps one
of the CRIMINALS roughly by the collar -- This guy is Jack
Bauer on Red Bull

TRENT (ON THE TV)
I don’t have time for this Where are
the hostages I said WHERE ARE THE
HOSTAGES
EXT ETHAN’S HOUSE - FRONT YARD

As Ethan saunters outside in his bathrobe to get the paper
he notices that his next door neighbor’s house is covered
entirely in WHIPPED CREAM with CHOCOLATE SPRINKLES and a
CHERRY on top

Ethan retrieves the paper and scans the headline GIANT
LIZARD ATTACKS TOKYO

Yawning he inadvertently locks eyes with a young woman a few
houses down across the street Cute and Petite CLAIRE
BEAN(20’s) collects her newspaper with the same lack of
enthusiasm as Ethan

Ethan is transfixed by her gaze But even though she lives
just down the block she might as well live on Mars

Suddenly an EARTHQUAKE shakes him out of his spell

Embarrassed he scurries back inside his house

INT ETHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN

Annoyed with himself Ethan fixes a pot of decaffeinated
coffee and pours himself a bowl of Corn Flakes

WILLIE (0S)
Why don’t you just talk to her

Annoyed Ethan doesn’t turn to the speaker

ETHAN
She just moved into the neighborhood
I don’t want to bother her

WILLIE (0S)
Maybe she needs a friend

ETHAN
Leave me alone

WILLIE (0S)

Are you in one of your funk’s again
(beat)

When I’m down you know what always

puts a smile on my face

ETHAN
You’re not getting a belly rub
He glares down at his feet WILLIE his Scottish Terrier
looks up at him

WILLIE
Can’t fault me for trying

ETHAN
Just let me eat my breakfast in peace

WILLIE
Fine I’m just saying it’s a little
sad that your only friend is a dog

As he sits down at the kitchen table and takes a bite of his
cereal his eyes fall longingly to the snowglobe that now is
perched by his open briefcase

Willie flicks on a nearby TV

NEWSCASTER (ON THE TV)
-a sudden rash of vandalism by none
other than Chuckles the Clown has once
again plagued Metroville

Behind the Newscaster grainy cellphone footage plays of a
GANG OF CLOWNS spraying houses with whipped cream and
throwing pies at innocent bystanders

EXT METROVILLE CITY - LATER

Dressed for work and carrying a briefcase Ethan heads down
the congested sidewalk

Suddenly FOUR MASKED BANDITS race out of a BANK a block
ahead of him

Not a moment later a flash of red rockets from the sky
straight at them

BYSTANDER 1
LOOK IT’S THE HUMAN SPROCKET

THE HUMAN SPROCKET(30’s) clobbers the bank robbers within
seconds and saves the day He’s Superman and Batman all
rolled into one and he doesn’t even wear a mask to disguise
his identity

BYSTANDER 2
Thank you Human Sprocket

As the crowd gathers around Ethan desperately tries to worm
his way past

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
That’s what I’m here for good
citizens of Metroville

EXT JASPER and MCMILLIGANS - COURTYARD

Before Ethan enters his office he crosses to a food cart
parked outside the building It’s the same VENDOR from the
opening scene

FOOD CART VENDOR
Morning Mr Hayes The usual

ETHAN
Yeah

The Vendor hands him a PLAIN DONUT

FOOD CART VENDOR
Maybe-a tomorrow you try with-a
chocolate glaze and some-a sprinkles
Spice it up-a bit No

ETHAN
No Simple is better

FOOD CART VENDOR
Who said-a life’s supposed to be-a

simple

ETHAN
No one I just like it plain That’s
all

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - 12TH FLOOR

The premiere makers of wacky and zany toys Jasper and
McMilligan is THE place to work It’s more like a party than
a job as Ethan’s colleagues test out the latest new gadgets
and gizmos

Ethan saunters to his cubicle to find his boss MR
McMILLIGAN(50’s) waiting for him The man exudes Level-10
exuberanceconstantly
MR MCMILLIGAN
Hey sport How are we looking for the
big presentation later today

ETHAN
It’s coming together

Smiling wide Mr McMilligan gives Ethan a fatherly rub on
the shoulder

MR MCMILLIGAN

Great Great news A lot’s riding on
this one son

(beat)
Why I remember when I first got here
I had just made that wish that put me
in the body of a grown man But I
still lacked that confidence All that
changed when I had my first big pitch

He stares directly into Ethan’s eyes

MR MCMILLIGAN
I believe that day has finally come
for you sport I want you to knock it
out of the park Hit a winning run for
the team but most importantly for
yourself

(beat)

Now wish me luck I’m off to get my
driver learners permit

With that he’s off

Ethan lays down his briefcase and pulls out the small
snowglobe Carefully placing it on his desk he slumps in his
chair

He takes a look at the roughs for the presentation

The product is a walking and talking girlie-doll called
“Girlie-Doll” that can do everything from pee to create a

real emotional bond with a child

VOICE
Pssstyou there

Confused Ethan looks around for the origin of the voice
VOICE
Up here

His eyes travel up to a VENT near the ceiling TWO EYES stare
down at him

This doesn’t seem to faze Ethan one bit

ETHAN
What can I do for you Mr Jasper

MR JASPER
I need you to do something for me
Come closer

Ethan crosses to the vent

MR JASPER
Closer

He stands on his tippy-toes

Suddenly the vent slowly lifts -- and a COFFEE MUG is
lowered to Ethan

MR JASPER
Cream and sugar

Ethan SIGHS and takes the mug

CUT TO

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGANS - 1ST FLOOR LOBBY

The front door to the main lobby flies open as KATRINA(30s)
a stunning woman in a slinky black dress briskly enters
Looking all business she passes by the Security Desk toward
the elevators

The SECURITY GUARD pops up from his chair and chases after
her with his clipboard as she gets in the elevator

SECURITY GUARD
Miss You have to sign in

Katrina glares at him

KATRINA
What floor is Jasper and McMilligans
SECURITY GUARD
UmmmThe twelfth floor Do you have
an appointment

The elevator door slides closed in the guard’s face

KATRINA
I don’t need one

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGANS - ETHAN’S CUBICLE

Stressed out by the Girlie-Doll Presentation Ethan picks up
his snowglobe and gives it a good shake Watching the
iridescent snow float around the farmhouse in the protected
glass sphere has the desired calming effect

He looks up at the clock Lunchtime

Reaching into his briefcase he pulls out a brown bag and
heads out of the busy office

THE BREAKROOM

Ethan enters the small cafeteria only to discover a dozen
VELOCIRAPTORS wearing party hats celebrating one of the
pack’s birthday

All activity in the room suddenly ceases

As the dinosaurs stare at Ethan blankly -- he slowly backs
out the door

VELOCIRAPTOR 1 turns to the birthday girl

VELOCIRAPTOR 1
That was awkward
(beat)
I totally forgot to invite him

“BIRTHDAY GIRL” VELOCIRAPTOR
I’m glad you didn’t He’s weird
EXT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN

Ethan explodes from the back door and sees a secluded area by
a tree Heading for it he takes a seat Just as he’s about
to open his bag --

-- A MARCHING BAND playing at ear-piercing levels turns the
corner and heads right toward him They are followed by
DANCERS and SINGERS celebrating God knows what

Frustrated Ethan heads back into the building

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - 12TH FLOOR

Ethan locates a broom closet and slumps on the floor by the
slop buckets and mops

It’s cramped and dimly lit but it’1ll do --

-- Suddenly the closet door whips open as GUY
LANNERMAN (30s) barges in and starts quickly undressing

ETHAN
Ummmmm

LANNERMAN
Hey Ethan Didn’t see you there
(beat)
I’m excited about the presentation
later today

Giving up Ethan squeezes by as Lannerman changes into THE
HUMAN SPROCKET

ETHAN
Just don’t be late You know how Mr
McMilligan gets

ETHAN’S CUBICLE

As Ethan slumps in his chair he tosses his bagged lunch into
the wastebasket

He reaches for the snowglobe and stares at farmhouse in the
middle of nowhere

Ethan SIGHS as he gazes at it longingly

MATCH CUT TO

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - 8TH FLOOR - ART DEPARTMENT

The exact same farmhouse snowglobe sits in front of Claire on
her desk

She has the same forlorn expression in her eyes as she stares
at it

CLAIRE’S BOSS (0S)
We need to spruce it up a bit newbie

CLAIRE
Please call me Claire

CLAIRE’S BOSS leans in over her shoulder

CLAIRE’S BOSS
It’s too dull and boring The original
run was a complete bust for us I
believe we only sold one

Frustrated she turns to her boss

CLAIRE
I suppose you’d prefer it if I added
an alien spaceship attacking the
farmhouse

CLAIRE’S BOSS
Now you’re getting it Hot Stuff
Maybe the others were wrong about you
I’m sure you’ll fit in fine
(beat)
Just get your head out of the clouds

CUT TO
EXT OUTER SPACE - ALIEN SPACESHIP
A massive saucer-shaped ALIEN SPACESHIP hovers in the sky on
the dark side of the moon
INT ALIEN SPACESHIP - COMMAND BRIDGE
The ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD the monstrous leader of the aliens
stands at the center of the enormous bridge surrounded by a
horde of his extraterrestrial UNDERLINGS He’s all eyes and

mouths -- Rather icky to be honest with you

His soldiers stare at him blankly

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
I am pleased to inform you that my
brilliantly conceived plan to conquer
the Earth and subjugate its citizens
is finally coming to fruition

ALIEN HECKLER
That’s what you said the last time

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Who said that

No one fesses up

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
This is true that I have made promises
before--

ALTEN HECKLER
And before that

The alien leader grits his multiple mouths

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
This time it’s different
(beat)
Remember that human female we abducted
on our first visit to Earth

ALIEN HECKLER
You mean Tracy You don’t forget a
dame like that

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Hey a little respect please

An image appears on a screen behind the leader showing a
crude animation of a transparent human baby

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Anyway Her boy child is now of age
and the Accumlatron device that we
implanted in him is finally ready to
harvest

The image zooms in on a portion of the baby’s brain to reveal
a small device behind the left ear

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
By now the Accumlatron is filled to
the brim with the brain enzyme
produced when the subject experiences
severe dissatisfaction with his life--

ALIEN HECKLER
Maybe you should check our brains
first

Annoyed the Alien Under-Overlord puffs up with anger

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Yes I get it You guys think I’m an
idiot
(beat)
But I’m gonna be the one laughing when
Im--

leaders are trembling at my feet

Evil mastermind BARNABAS(60‘s) has assembled his HENCHMEN in
the hanger bay of his secret lair hidden many miles below the
depths of the Pacific Ocean He makes the James Bond villains
look like a bunch of rank amateurs

HENCHMEN 1 raises his hand and waits patiently until
Barnabas calls on him

BARNABAS
A question

HENCHMAN 1
How does this plan differ from the
last six times

BARNABAS
I‘1l tell you This time we’re going
to steal all the money in the world
(dramatic pause)
And then some

This gets a rousing applause from his henchmen

SECRETARY (0S)
--ETHAN HAYES

Shocked out of his daze Ethan turns to the SECRETARY
standing nearby

ETHAN
Yes

SECRETARY
I just got a call from the Art
Department Your presentation posters
are ready

A BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT explodes in the cubicle next to
him

Wracked with stress Ethan barely notices

NEARBY CUBICLE

A NAKED MYSTERIOUS MAN gets up off the floor in the secluded
cubicle He has a steely gaze in his eyes as he scans the
enclosed space

A metal sign on the desk reads Guy Lannerman Head of
Research Tacked up on the interior wall amongst work related
documents are pictures of The Human Sprocket as well as a
HUMAN SPROCKET ACTION FIGURE hanging on a push pin

The intruder rifles through the draws and finds multiple
pairs of shirts and pants shoved inside Weird

Now fully dressed he slowly emerges from Lannerman’s cubicle
and makes a beeline toward Ethan

ETHAN’S CUBICLE

Ethan looks at his watch The stress shows on his face

Gathering some documents he jumps up from his chair and
heads out of his area just as --

-- Katrina rounds the corner holding a full MUG OF COFFEE

SMACK -- They collide into each other as the coffee flies out
of the mug and splashes directly into the Mystery Man’s face

SCREAMING the Man’s hands go to his face and he races off

KATRINA
Watch where you’re going moron

ETHAN
I’m sorry I’ve got a huge
presentation and--

KATRINA
Wait a minute Are you Ethan Hayes

ETHAN
Ummmmyes

KATRINA
Just the man I wanted to see

Ethan stares at her blankly

ETHAN
Why

KATRINA
I’m Katrina The Agency sent me

ETHAN
What Agency

KATRINA
THE Agency

Katrina scoops up Ethan’s snowglobe off his desk and after a
cursory glance at it tosses it back and forth in her hands

KATRINA
I’m here to assist you in the
presentation

Ethan watches anxiously as his precious ornament is man-
handled by Katrina

ETHAN
But Lannerman is the point--

She violently slams the snowglobe down on the desk

KATRINA
You talk too much Where’s the doll

ETHAN
Huh

KATRINA
The Girlie-Doll I need to make some
last minute modifications

ETHAN
The presentation is in less than an
hour

KATRINA

That’s why they’re called “last
minute” modifications

ETHAN
I think--

KATRINA
And you can get me a new coffee on the
way

A VOICE chimes in from the ceiling vent
MR JASPER (0S)
Better make that two
HALLWAY
Looking like a beaten dog Ethan leads the way down the hall

Katrina stays a few paces behind as she brings a finger up
to her right ear

KATRINA
(whispered into earpiece)
The rooster is in the hen house

BATHROOM

The Mystery Man splashes his face with cold water As he pops
his head up to look in the mirror --

-- We discover that he’s not a man at all The flesh is
melted away revealing a robot face beneath

He is CYBER-VOX 3000 Cyborg Assassin from the future

Using his high-tech Robo-Vision the cyborg studies himself
in the mirror

He looks as if he might cry

CYBER-VOX 3000
Great

TOY STORAGE ROOM
GIRLIE-DOLL sits on a shelf amongst a number of other toys

ETHAN
This is the prototype

KATRINA
Thanks I can take it from here

ETHAN
I really--

KATRINA
There you go with the talking again
(beat)
Look EthanThis upgradeWell the
tech’s proprietary So no prying eyes
I’m sure you understand

ETHAN
But--

She SHUSHES him with her finger
KATRINA
ShhhhhhhThat’s right Of course you

understand

She unceremoniously hastens him out the door with a polite
shove then slams the door in his face

Having no choice Ethan heads back to his cubicle

As soon as she’s sure he’s gone Katrina grabs Girlie-Doll
off the shelf and slams her on a nearby table

She rips open the back of its lovely white dress
KATRINA
I’ve got a treat for you my pretty
little friend

She pulls out a HI-TECH DEVICE from her pocket as she taps
her earpiece with her free hand

A tiny CAMERA extends and focuses on the doll
KATRINA (INTO COM)

Alright Boss I’ve got the doll open
Now what

INT SECRET UNDERWATER LAIR - BARNABAS’ OFFICE

Barnabas sits behind his desk as a large monitor in front of
him displays an image from the earpiece’s POV

BARNABAS
I can see it loud and clear

KATRINA (ON COM)
You mean see it clearly

BARNABAS
You’re going to need to lift up the
battery casing and then remove the
four screws beneath

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - TOY STORAGE ROOM

Katrina follows the instructions to the letter

BARNABAS (ON COM)
That’s right Now cut the red
wirenoI mean the blue wire and
patch that into the unit

Katrina obeys
KATRINA (INTO COM)
And this will turn this stupid doll

into a death machine

BARNABAS (ON COM)
Precisely

KATRINA (INTO COM)
This is going to be quite a
presentation

BATHROOM

Cyber-Vox 3000 comes out of the bathroom covering his face so
not to attract attention

He stumbles toward the wall as Katrina briskly walks by him
on her way back to Ethan’s cubicle

The Cyborg suddenly comes upon a door The sign on the wall
next to it reads Halloween Costumes Research Lab -- Bingo

HALLOWEEN COSTUMES RESEARCH LAB
Once inside Cyber-Vox 3000 locates a box full of MASKS

Grabbing one he pulls it over his robotic face The mask is
of high quality and looks sort of convincingsort of

As he straightens it out in the mirror we notice the label on
the box THE HUMAN SPROCKET Halloween Masks

CUT TO

EXT ETHAN’S HOUSE - THE SKIES ABOVE

A large billowing cloud forms over Ethans house then
suddenly disperses revealing --

-- The Alien Spaceship

It slows to a stop hovering directly above

INT ETHAN’S HOUSE - KITCHEN
Willie stops licking himself as one of his ears perks up

CUT TO

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - ETHAN’S CUBICLE

Katrina watches Ethan with disgust as he readies the Girlie-
Doll presentation

KATRINA
Are you ready yet This is boring with
a capital “B”

ETHAN
We can pick up the posters from the
Art Department

KATRINA
Great A field trip

ETHAN
Well it’s only on the 8th floor

KATRINA
I was being sarcastic

8TH FLOOR - ART DEPARTMENT

As Ethan and Katrina enter the Art Department theres no one
available at the front desk to help them

Annoyed Katrina finds a button that reads “Ring for Service”
and repeatedly presses it

KATRINA
A little help here

A moment later a VOICE yells out from the back
CLAIRE’S BOSS (0S)
Hey newbie give ‘em a hand at the
front

A door behind the front desk opens as Claire enters

CLAIRE
Sorry for that Can I help

Claire recognizes Ethan right away

CLAIRE
You

Ethan’s equally as shocked

ETHAN
When did you start working here

CLAIRE
I just started on Monday

Katrina watches them as if they were two retarded seals
attempting to skate on freshly poured concrete

KATRINA
You two know each other

CLAIRE
Wellsort of

She awkwardly holds out her hand

CLAIRE
ClaireMy name’s Claire

Ethan takes her hand

ETHAN
EthanI’m Ethan

KATRINA
What are you in the same therapy
group

ETHAN

Claire’s my new neighbor

It’s painfully obvious to Katrina that Ethan’s smitten with
this girl The Femme Fatale gets a sinister look in her eye --

-- as she suddenly wraps her arm around Ethan’s shoulder

KATRINA
Why didn’t you tell me we had a new
neighbor sweetie We should have her
over for dinner some time I’m sure
the kids will absolutely adore her

Ethan is absolutely mortified but before he can say a word
Katrina keeps going

KATRINA
So Claire why don’t you be a good
neighbor and slide on back there and
get my darling’s presentation posters
so he can earn me and the fam a few
shekels so we don’t have to go hungry
this winter

As an extra added bonus Katrina plants a sloppy wet kiss on
Ethan’s mouth

It’s hard to tell who’s more shell-shocked Ethan or Claire

CLAIRE
SureI’1l1’11 get it right away

Embarrassed Claire races into the back

As soon as she’s gone Katrina pushes Ethan away as she wipes
her mouth with the back of her hand

KATRINA
Now that’s how you get things done
around here

INT ELEVATOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Holding the posters Ethan stands in silence next to Katrina
in the empty elevator

KATRINA
Do you have a mint

ETHAN
Ummmyour breath is fine

KTRINA
It’s for you

INT ART DEPARTMENT - CLAIRE’S CUBICLE

Heartbroken Claire slumps in her chair She glances at the
snowglobe on her desk Within the iridescent snowflakes the
farm house blazes on fire as it is sieged by aliens

CLAIRE’S BOSS (0OS)
Is that snowglobe done yet Cupcake

Wiping away the tears Claire’s face scrunches in
frustration She reaches into a drawer and returns with a
mean-looking miniature GIANT ROBOT

CLAIRE
Not yet

12TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY

As Ethan and Katrina exit the elevator the masked CYBER-VOX
3000 sees his chance to strike

His Robo-Vision hones in on Ethans vitals as the words
“Exterminate” flash on his screen

Arms thrust out ahead of him his hands are just about to
clamp around the back of Ethans neck when --

CO-WORKER 1 (0S)
Hey Lannerman Ive been looking all
over for you

CO-WORKER 1 grabs Cyber-Vox 3000 by the shoulder stopping
him in mid-kill

CO-WORKER 1
Were testing out a new game and
wanted another set of eyes on it

Cyber-Vox 3000 is literally dragged away by the Man

OBSERVATION ROOM

The cramped OBSERVATION ROOM has a few chairs in front of a
wall sized one-way mirror In the TESTING ROOM beyond is a
small group of PRETEENS ready to try out a new video game

CYBER-VOX 3000
I’ve got to go

The Cyborg tries to leave but CO-WORKER 1 stops him

CO-WORKER 1

Give me a break Lannerman I need
your help on this one Everyone knows
your word is key around here

(beat)
Besides I had your back during that
whole Jerky fiasco Least you can do
is return the favor

After an awkward moment Cyber-Vox 3000 takes a seat

CO-WORKER 1
That’s my Guy

He ruffles the mask’s hair which causes it to shift slightly
but CO-WORKER 1 doesn’t seem to notice

CYBER-VOX 3000
What are these early-stage Human
Organics testing

CO-WORKER 1
It’s a new game from Softbrain Studios
called Cyber-nihilation Something
about rampaging robots or something
stupid like that

Suddenly Cyber-Vox 3000 is intrigued

CYBER-VOX 3000
Really

The game testing begins

It becomes evident very quickly that these kids just plain
suck at the game Their ineptness is starting to irk the
cyborg as his leg starts to bop up in down in frustration

CYBER-VOX 3000
Come on that was such an easy shot

Another kid fails miserably

CYBER-VOX 3000
That’s right Give up Pathetic

Then another

CYBER-VOX 3000
Fail

Another gets taken out causing the Cyborg to jump out of his
chair and pound on the one-way mirror

CYBER-VOX 3000
You suck No wonder we subjugated you
so easily

CO-WORKER 1
Take it easy Lannerman--

Before he can finish Cyber-Vox 3000 storms out of the
Observation Room --

-- then bursts into the Testing Room not a second later

He snatches the controller out of one of the Preteen’s hands
and restarts the game

CYBER-VOX 3000
Watch and learn

With lightning fast reflexes the cyborg owns this game
destroying every CGI robot that gets in his crosshairs

CYBER-VOX 3000
Die you robot scum

The kids cheer him on

ETHAN’S CUBICLE

Sweat beads on Ethan’s brow as he tries to calm himself with
the snowglobe before the presentation begins Katrina rolls
her eyes

KATRINA
Would you stop with the snowglobe
already
(beat)
You’re making me nervous

ETHAN
It relaxes me

KATRINA
Smoke a cigarette or take a drink like
the rest of us

ETHAN
I don’t want to be like you

KATRINA
You’re probably in luck there

Ignoring her Ethan focuses on the safe world inside the
glass globe --

Katrina snatches it from his hands and slams it back on the
desk

KATRINA
Listen kid It’s simple Just don’t
screw it up

ETHAN
Thanks for the vote of confidence
You’re not the one who could lose his
job

Ethan gingerly picks up the snowglobe and places it in his
pocket

KATRINA
How about I make it even easier to

understand for you

She gets in his face

KATRINA
Screw this up and your job will be the
least of your worries

ETHAN
You have a lot of issues

KATRINA
I could say the same about you

ETHAN
At least I’m not angry all the time

This hits home Annoyed she bares her teeth

KATRINA
Just get the doll so we can get this
over with

EXT BOARDROOM - MINUTES LATER
Mr McMilligan waits for them outside the door

MR MCMILLIGAN
I just wanted to remind you how much
I’m counting on you

ETHAN
Ummm Thanks

His boss eyes Katrina curiously (who is this woman) before
turning back to Ethan

MR MCMILLIGAN
Where’s Lannerman I thought he was
point on this one

GAME TESTING ROOM

Co-Worker 1 pokes his head into the testing room as Cyber-
Vox 3000 struggles to get past one of the game’s more
difficult levels The kids are gathered around him completely
enthralled

CO-WORKER 1
Hey Lannerman McMilligan’s looking
for you

CYBER-VOX 3000
Leave me alone I just want to finish
this level

CO-WORKER 1
Whatever dude but I think you’re
about to miss your big presentation

Suddenly someone plows into him from behind and they both
tumble to the floor

LANNERMAN
Hey what’s the big hurry

As Lannerman gets off the ground he turns to help up -- Guy
Lannerman

LANNERMAN
What the--

Cyber-Vox 3000 cold cocks Lannerman and shoves him into a
nearby broom closet

Sprinting down the hallway the masked cyborg arrives at the
boardroom just as Ethan and Katrina enter

The door slams shut in his face

Even though the Human Sprocket mask can’t make an expression
we somehow know that the cyborg is screwed

Suddenly an antenna extends from the top of Cyber-Vox 3000s
head and pokes up through the mask

BOARDROOM

Mr McMilligan and a large group of intimidating EXECUTIVES
sit around a conference table watching like hawks as Katrina
places the poster artwork on the easels and Ethan sets the
Girlie-Doll on the table

Mr Jasper also observes from a floor grate beneath them
Nervously Ethan rubs the stress from his neck when --

-- the door bursts open revealing the phony Guy Lannerman in
the doorway He looks intense and ready to kill

CYBER-VOX 3000
Desist immediately

Stomping up to Ethan --

-- he suddenly turns and addresses the Suits in a completely
businesslike manner

CYBER-VOX 3000
The Real-Life Girlie-Doll isn’t just
the Doll of the future
(dramatic pause)
Ladies and Gentlemen It is the
future

The executives are enthralled So enthralled that they don’t
seem to notice the rather obvious mask the Cyborg is wearing

CYBER-VOX 3000
Not only can this remarkable product
bond with your child on an emotional
level but it can also do your taxes--

The boardroom door shatters off its hinges as --

-- The Human Sprocket flies into the room and tackles the
bogus Guy Lannerman

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
I’ve got you imposter

He grabs hold of the mask and tears it free revealing the
true face of Cyber-Vox 3000

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
This is not Guy Lannerman but an evil
Robot from the future

The Executives GASP

CYBER-VOX 3000
Technically I’m a cyborg

Chaos erupts and everyone flees for the door

MR MCMILLIGAN
(to one of the Execs)
We’ll reschedule this for another day
I‘1ll have my assistant set it up

As Ethan and Katrina try to stay out of harm’s way the
cyborg punches The Human Sprocket in the gut

CYBER-VOX 3000
You ruined my sales pitch

Cyber-Vox 3000 shoves the momentarily stunned superhero away
as he turns to Ethan with his steely gaze

CYBER-VOX 3000
You now leave me no choice

Raising his right arm the synthetic skin sloughs off
revealing a whole mess of armaments attached to his
cybernetic arm

Multiple RED LASER TARGETS pepper Ethan’s upper torso

CYBER-VOX 3000
Back to Plan A

KABLAMMM -- Ethan bobs and weaves just barely avoiding the
Cyborg’s attack as Katrina grabs the Girlie-Doll off the
table

Fearing for the safety of Ethan and Katrina The Human
Sprocket propels himself at them

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Fear not I’ll save you

Grabbing one in each arm he smashes through the large
boardroom windows

Katrina almost drops the doll as he flies them to safety
outside the building

EXT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - PARKING LOT

The superhero deposits them on the ground away from danger
It’s chaos on a massive scale

People SCREAM at the top of their lungs as they evacuate the
building under siege

Flaming debris from the 12th Floor rains from the sky as a
big hunk of building lands directly on the Food Cart in the
courtyard

FOOD CART VENDOR
You got-a be-a kidding me

As The Human Sprocket speeds to the entrance to help Claire
exits the building and races over to Ethan and Katrina

CLAIRE
What’s happening

Ethan SIGHS

ETHAN
Just another normal day in my life

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - BOARDROOM

High up in the Building Cyber-Vox 3000 looks down from the
busted up window His Robo-Vision scans the parking lot for
signs of Ethan and targets him right away

EXT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - PARKING LOT

Suddenly a black SUV screeches to a halt beside Ethan
Claire and Katrina Cast in shadows the driver yells through
the open passengerside window

TRENT
Get in

Before Ethan can react Katrina grabs his arm with her free
hand

KATRINA
Youre not going anywhere

TRENT
I don’t have time for this

Pushing open the side door the man removes his shades --
-- its FEDERAL AGENT TRENT EVANS in the flesh

KATRINA
Trent

With lightning speed Trent levels a GUN at Katrina

TRENT
Show me your hands I said SHOW ME
YOUR HANDS

Katrina holds out Girlie-Doll

KATRINA
It’s just a doll

TRENT
I should have known that you’d be
mixed up in this

KATRINA
Oh that’s so typical of you

TRENT
Mr Hayes get into the car

KATRINA
Don’t listen to him Unless you like
to be tortured

Ethan and Claire are at a loss what to do

TRENT
I don’t know what this woman has told
you--

KATRINA

This woman Nice

KABOOOM A minor shock wave jostles Ethan and the others
They turn to see --

-- Cyber-Vox 3000 recovering from his fall a few yards away
in a crater of pulverized concrete Most of his human body
has been torn away and he looks pissed

KATRINA
Get in the car

Ethan and Claire dive into the backseat as Katrina tosses in
Girlie-Doll then jumps into the front

She shoves Trent’s gun out of her face

KATRINA
I’m still mad that you never called

TRENT
Trust me you don’t want to go down
that road with me

Ethan and Claire poke their heads over the backseat and see
the Cyborg baring down on the idling SUV

ETHAN CLAIRE
DRIVE DRIVE DRIVE

Katrina HUFFS then fastens her seatbelt

KATRINA
This discussion’s not over

Trent slams his foot on the gas as they speed off leaving
Cyber-Vox 3000 in their dust

The cyborg heads for the nearest car -- a cherry red
convertible VW BUG -- and jumps inside

His index finger morphs into a key which he jams into the
ignition and revs up

He suddenly stops briefly --
-- to adjust the rearview mirror and put on his seatbelt

Fastened in he activates his turn signal and checks the
mirror Satisfied that it’s safe he carefully pulls out of
the space and follows Trent’s SUV obeying the speed limit

INSIDE TRENT’S SUV

Trent bobs and weaves through traffic blowing every red
light at top speed

TRENT
Weve got to lose him

As Ethan and Claire are tossed around in the backseat Ethan
catches a glimpse out the back window There’s no sign of the
VW Bug

ETHAN
I think we already--

TRENT
Keep your head down Mr Hayes unless
you want to lose it

Trent continues to drive recklessly even though there’s no
immediate danger

INSIDE THE VW BUG - MILES BACK

Christopher Cross’ “SAILING” blares on the radio as Cyber-Vox
3000 stops the car abruptly at a crosswalk and lets some OLD
FOLKS hobble across the street

INSIDE TRENT’S SUV

Trent turns to the others as he continues to drive

TRENT
We lost them

ETHAN
Yeah I think about five minutes ago--

TRENT
I don’t have time for speculation Do
you understand

Ethan and Claire regard one another -- Trent’s a little
intense for their tastes

KATRINA
He’s always this high strung

TRENT
We don’t have much time
(beat)
Now Mr Hayes if you don’t tell me
what I want to know then it’1l just
be a question of how much you want it
to hurt

KATRINA
He means torture

TRENT
Stand down

ETHAN
Tell you what

The car comes to a screeching halt

TRENT
This

EXT ETHAN’S HOUSE - DUSK

The alien spaceship hovers above Ethan’s house The building
has been taken over by the aliens and now looks like an HR
Giger painting on acid

ETHAN
How did we get back to my house so
quickly It usually takes me a good
half hour from the city even without
traffic

TRENT
I don’t have time to explain right
now
Ethan’s eyes fall on his front door -- Willie scratches

wildly at the screen

TRENT (0S)
You’re going to tell me everything I
want to know or I swear to --

ETHAN
Willie

Jumping out of the SUV Ethan races toward the front Trent
immediately keys his com

TRENT
I need an interrogation room prepped
Now

He levels his gun at Ethan but Katrina knocks his arms down
so he loses his target

KATRINA
Calm down Trent

Trent glares at her

As soon as Ethan opens the door Willie bursts out full
sprint -- not into Ethans arms but toward the nearest bush

He empties his bladder

WILLIE
Holy crap Ive been holding that all
day

As Claire Trent and Katrina catch up Willie finally
finishes

ETHAN
What the hell is happening

WILLIE
I had to pee I thought that was
obvious

ETHAN
Not that
(points to the house)
THAT

The dog seems awfully casual

WILLE
OhThe aliens need your brain for
something Some kind of enzyme they
need to take over the world
(beat)
I told them as soon as you got home
from work they could probably just

take it

ETHAN
You told them they could have my
brain

WILLIE

They had treats

Suddenly The Alien Under-Overlord bursts from the front door
with his army of Alien Underlings

Theres no time to react as the Aliens --

-- race right by them and head directly to the bushes to take
a leak

Finished peeing the Under-Overlord turns to the group of
dazed humans

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
What It was a long flight

Zipping up he levels his DEATH RAY on the group

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
You probably want to know why we’re
here

TRENT
Save your breath The dog already
briefed us

The Alien leader glares at Willie

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
You told

He then turns to one of his Soldiers

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Confirm with the scanner

The Alien Underling takes a scan of Ethan The funky looking
device directs a beam of light at Ethan’s head and BEEPS
merrily

ALIEN SOLIDER 1
Yep

As he turns the scanner ray flashes in Claire’s face As she
winces the Device BEEPS again

ETHAN
Claire are you alright

Alien Soldier 1 shuffles over to his boss and shows him
Claire’s reading on the device’s display -- Interesting

They whisper amongst themselves

ALIEN SOLIDER 1
He just called her Claire

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
That’s Claire Weird coincidence
Goodbut still weird

TRENT
Who are you working for

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Shut up human We’re talking here
Ever heard of manners

TRENT
I’ve killed ten people since midnight
I haven’t slept in over 48 hours So
maybe you should be a little more
afraid of me than you are now

Perturbed The Alien Under-Overlord barks at his troops

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Take Mr Hayes and the one called
“Claire” Kill the others

Ray guns are suddenly leveled at Katrina Trent and Willie
just as --

-- the red VW Bug careens at top speed toward them taking out
a good number of the Alien Soldiers

CYBER-VOX 3000
This is going to ruin my insurance

The group disperses as Cyber-Vox 3000 leaps from the car and
strafes the aliens

A stray shot smacks Girlie-Doll smacking it out of Katrina’s
grasp She reaches for it but is tugged the opposite
direction by Trent

TRENT
Leave it

Another blast just misses her and she’s left with no choice
but to abandon the doll

ON ETHAN AND CLAIRE

As fire and smoke consume the area Ethan and Claire get
separated in the confusion

CLAIRE
Ethan

She reaches out toward a shape in the fog --
-- as ALIEN SOLDIER 1 grabs her

CLAIRE
Let go of me

The Alien drags her back into the house --
ALIEN SOLIDER 1
Boy I never thought I’d see you
again

-- and up into the spaceship above

Before Ethan can help he’s tackled by Trent

TRENT
I need you to trust me

Ethan’s forced into the SUV as Trent and Katrina hop in the
front and floor it

Locked in the backseat Ethan watches helplessly as the alien
spaceship detaches from his house and flies up into the
heavens

ETHAN
CLAIRE

Trent turns to Katrina

TRENT
I need to talk to the President

KATRINA
No We need to talk to “Him”

Trent shakes his head

TRENT
“He’s” the last person I want to see

INT ALIEN SPACESHIP - BRIDGE - LATER

Relishing a fine job the Alien Under-Overlord plops into his
Command Chair

Alien Soldier 1 holds a cuffed Claire

ALIEN SOLIDER 1
What should I do with the Human male

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
I believe that’s a female

ALIEN SOLIDER 1
Are you sure How can you tell

The Leader points to her chest

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
It’s got boobies
(beat)
Take her to the lab for study I’1l
prepare the troops for our most
glorious invasion

Completely mortified Claire’s whisked out of the command
center as the alien leader addresses his soldiers

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
What did I say boys Fourth times a
charm

As Claire’s taken to the Alien Lab something small moves in
the shadows --

-- It’s Willie He stowed away on the ship

Lowering his leg he finishes “marking his territory” and
trots after Claire

FADE TO

EXT MIDWEST - DESERTED HIGHWAY - THE NEXT MORNING

As Trent’s SUV barrels down the deserted highway in the
middle of nowhere Ethan sleeps in the backseat clutching the
snowglobe in his hands

Katrina watches him nap She turns to Trent as he takes a sip
of coffee from a to-go cup

KATRINA
In many ways hes a lot like you used
to be

Trent does a spit take

TRENT
You probably don’t think that I can
force this coffee cup down your
throat But I can All the way

KATRINA
Trust me I know I believe you said
something similar when you left me

She slumps in her seat as he pulls off the highway at top
speed onto an old dirt road

TRENT
You were a double-agent for Barnabas

KATRINA
Oh that again Maybe youre just too
judgmental

The car screeches to a halt

TRENT
The only reason that you’re conscious
right now is because I don’t want to
carry you

Hurt Katrina gets out and opens up the back She gently
shakes Ethan’s shoulder

KATRINA
Were here

Ethan rubs his eyes as a familiar house comes into focus --

-- Its the exact farmhouse from his snowglobe The place
hes always dreamed of living

He looks down at the snowglobe then back at the house

ETHAN
I cant believe it

CUT TO

EXT ETHAN’S HOUSE - LATER

Ethan’s home is in ruins Flaming Debris and alien bodies are
scattered around the perimeter

Lying among the wreckage is Cyber-Vox 3000 -- Hes not hurt

trying to relieve a migraine

It takes all his effort to get up off the ground He extends
his com antenna

EXT MIDWEST - COLORADOS HOUSE

Katrina knocks on the door to the secluded farm house in the
middle of nowhere as Ethan and Trent stand by the car

The door slowly opens revealing COLORADO SMITH(60’s) He
looks like Indiana Jones after a few too many bottles of
scotch

COLORADO
I didnt expect you to show your face
around here anymoreNot since your
mother died
Ethan instantly recognizes him

ETHAN
(To Katrina)
Your dads Colorado Smith

COLORADO
Unfortunately

Colorado looks less pleased to see Trent

COLORADO
Whats he doing here Didnt he put
you in prison

Katrina glares at Trent

KATRINA
Twice

COLORADO
What do you want

TRENT
It’s complicated

COLORADO
I was speaking to my daughter

TRENT
Millions of lives are at stake

COLORADO
Does he always talk this much

ETHAN
He’s telling the truth

COLORADO
Who’s this Your sidekick

KATRINA
No You’re the one with the sidekicks
I work alone remember

The dig isn’t lost on him

COLORADO
So you’re here to make me feel guilty
for being a bad father

KATRINA
That’s part of it

Colorado studies his daughter’s expression It’s ice cold

COLORADO
Then you better come inside

INT COLORADO’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Colorado’s Living Room is packed with RARE ARTIFACTS and
TREASURES from across the globe Even the coffee table
vaguely resembles The Ark of the Covenantor is it

Before Colorado has a chance to sit down Katrina launches

right in

KATRINA
We need your help

COLORADO
Well you’re too late That train has
left the station I’m retired

He slumps in an ornate antique chair

KATRINA
I don’t believe you

COLORADO
Believe it I’ve sworn off the “Call
to Adventure” years ago I found
myself a nice place in the middle of
God knows where and even got a little
garden out front

Enthralled Ethan takes a seat next to him

ETHAN
It sounds great

TRENT
I knew we shouldn’t have come here
It’s a waste of time

COLORADO
For once I agree with him

Barely able to contain himself Ethan butts in
ETHAN
So what’s it like

COLORADO
What’s what like

ETHAN
Your life I want to hear all about
it

COLORADO

Son I’ve been on more adventures than
you could possibly imagine Which one

ETHAN
No Not the adventures What’s it like
living here In peace and quiet

COLORADO
OhWell kid its not exactly peace
and quiet when you have your
ungrateful daughter showing up and
bringing people along to pester you

ETHAN
Can I see your garden

Colorado doesn’t know what to make of Ethan

COLORADO
My garden

ETHAN
Yes I’d love to see it

COLORADO
Sure Why not

As they get up Colorado turns to Katrina

COLORADO
There’s an apple pie in the fridge
You two can help yourself

KATRINA
Is it Mom’s recipe

COLORADO
No Your mother took that to the grave
as well

EXT COLORADO’S HOUSE - GARDEN

Situated on the side of the house The GARDEN is in rough
shape Pretty pathetic actually

COLORADO
Katrina’s mother had the green thumb
in the family But I do what I can
Trouble is these darn things need
tending and I was never good at that

ETHAN
I guess traveling around the world
looking for treasure didn’t afford you
much of a home life

COLORADO
No It certainly did not

ETHAN
But now you’ve got all the time in the
world Nobody making you go on quests
or people shooting at you Nobody
just you and your garden It sounds
great

COLORADO
Does it

ETHAN
Totally I wish I had a life like
this You’re in complete control
Anything is possible

Colorados eyes tell a different story

COLORADO
The funny thing is that I don’t ever
seem to get to fixing up this rotting
garden

Ethan’s no fool
ETHAN
(disappointed)
You’d rather go back to your life of

adventure Wouldn’t you

Colorado looks down at the worn out garden

COLORADO
The grass is greener on the other
side

ETHAN
Thats something my mother used to say
too

The old man looks at him queerly
COLORADO
NoI mean the grass is greener on

the other side of the house I just
got a new sprinkler system put in

(gets up)
I’11l show you
Colorado heads to the side of the house with Ethan in tow

An acre of bright green grass stretches out before them
There’s a LARGE RED BARN just beyond it Picturesque

Before Ethan can answer --

-- a RAY BEAM slams into the ground turning the grass into a
flaming mound of ash

Willie sneaks down the main corridor and pokes his head into
the laboratory

Claire is strapped to a table in the middle of the room as
the ALIEN SCIENTIST prepares a laser syringe

ALIEN SCIENTIST
What a lucky coincidence you turned
out to be

With only seconds to spare Willie gallops over to the alien

WILLIE
Let her go

The alien turns to the noise at his feet just as Willie bares
his sharp teeth and bites down hard into one of the his many
tentacle feet

As the dog clamps down harder the alien scientist just looks
at him oddly

ALIEN SCIENTIST
That kind of tickles

Thinking quick Willie bites a different tentacle

ALIEN SCIENTIST
Nope That just feels weird

Then another one

ALIEN SCIENTIST
I think I just threw up in my mouth

Willie tries a fourth one

ALIEN SCIENTIST
Whoa Hold on their fella I barely
know you--

KLANG -- A metal tray collides with the Alien’s head as
Claire takes matters into her own hands

As the scientist slumps to the floor she tugs at the
remaining straps that bind her to the surgical table

toward the house

Cyber-Vox 3000 sits in the truck’s cab with Girlie-Doll next
to him His hands are in his lap but he suddenly gets the
urge to reach for the wheel

An ANGRY VOICE blares from the speakers

No I mean he REALLY likes you of the
“he wants to hump your leg” variety

But he’s married

Willie does a spit take

WILLIE

Married Are you living in fantasy
land He’s painfully single

He doesn’t have the cajones to ask you

for let alone ask someone to marry

They race toward the large barn behind the house as Big

-- and suddenly transforms into a GIANT ROBOT

Cyber-Vox 3000 and Girlie-Doll are unceremoniously pitched
out of the cab and onto the harsh ground

Dusting himself off the Cyborg kicks the Big Brother Robot
in the toe

CYBER-VOX 3000
You don’t have to be such a Mega-Ass

The Cyborg picks up the doll and attaches her to his back as
Big Brother tears the top off the house and scans the exposed
top floor

BIG BROTHER
Where are the humans I cant see them
and I see everything

Directly above the alien spaceship fires another shot The
laser blasts off a chunk of the barn just as the barn doors
smash open and a PROPELLER PLANE speeds out across the field

Taking off into the sky Colorado pilots it straight toward
the alien spaceship Ethan Katrina and Trent huddle in the
rear section holding on for dear life

Do you have anything in this heap that
can take out a spaceship

with Girlie-Doll

A few of the Demons point at the Cyborg with his Doll and
snicker Cyber-Vox 3000 does his best to ignore them as
Girlie-Doll offers up some more well-timed wisdom

The taunting still irks the Cyborg as he wishes he was made
of a thicker gauged chrome

a little tapped out on the big plans
I don’t think I can face my troops
after this one

I really wanted to win this one for
them so badly I made them a promise--

Big Brother’s stereo suddenly clicks on as SAD VIOLIN MUSIC
blares from his speakers

He quickly switches it off as the Alien Leader glares up at
him with tears brewing in all his eyes

Thanks a lot Mr Sensitive

I’ve run a new program and calculated
that we’re not working at cross-
purposes I believe we can work
together

to the size of a three year old child

been on your mission we have moved
onto Phase two

Barnabas appears on a scaffolding high above them and has to
speak extra loudly to be heard

I have reduced our army to the size of
small children in anticipation of our
plan for world domination

The evil mastermind makes his way down a long ramp that
twists and turns as it descends to the hanger bay tarmac

Of course I didn’t anticipate that you
would screw up Phase One so expertly

a long plane ride Could we rest up a
bit and then you can tell us

Insulted Barnabas turns to his men

BARNABAS
Very well Take them away
The tiny henchmen surround the group including Katrina

KATRINA
Dont even think about it shorty

She shoves one of them away with her heel as they back off
from her

As Ethan Trent and Colorado are escorted out of the hanger
they simultaneously look back at Katrina

Disappointment shows in their eyes --

-- as the three of them realize theyre making the same
expression and quickly stop out of embarrassment

CUT TO

EXT MIDWEST - GAS STATION

As the sun beats down on them and a dust storm whips by
Claire and Willie see a desolate GAS STATION up ahead

With renewed vigor they race toward it

CLAIRE
Maybe they have a phone we can use

WILLIE
Who are you gonna call

Shes about to say --

WILLIE
Not an option Last I heard they were
off battling some Sumerian ghost god
in the New York Sewers

CLAIRE
Actually I was going to call the
police
She finds the payphone and picks up the receiver -- it’s not

even attached to the rest of the phone Dead

CLAIRE
Predictable

They approach the GREASY-SPOON DINER attached to the station

CLAIRE
Lets at least get some food Im
starving

As they enter Cyber-Vox 3000 watches from a distance with
his Robo-Vision

INSIDE THE DINER

The place is empty except for one CUSTOMER sitting by himself
at the end of the long counter

Claire and Willie plop down in the first booth as the
WAITRESS comes by with a pot of fresh coffee and some menus

WAITRESS
Would you like some

CLAIRE
That would be great Is it
decaffeinated

WILLIE
Wow And I thought my master was the
only one who drank that swill

WAITRESS
Sorry miss This is all’s we got

WILLIE
She’1l take it
(to Claire)
Trust me you want the caffeine

As she pours them each a steaming cup of joe --

-- the diner door bursts open and Cyber-Vox 3000 enters He
heads directly toward Claire and Willie

Suddenly a VOICE rings out from across the room stopping
everyone in their tracks

CUSTOMER (0S)
Its you

They all turn toward the man at the end of the counter --
Its Guy Lannerman

LANNERMAN
Why are you stalking me

Cyber-Vox 3000 is confused as Lannerman suddenly notices the
Girlie-Doll strapped to the Cyborg’s back

LANNERMAN
And what are you doing with the
prototype for my presentation

GIRLIE-DOLL
Uh-oh Somebodys in trouble

Thinking quick Claire is about to throw her coffee at Cyber-
Vox 3000 when --

-- he gives her “The Hand”

CYBER-VOX 3000
Dont you dare Ive had quite a day
as it is I dont need coffee thrown
in my face TWICE Thank you

The Cyborg turns to Lannerman

CYBER-VOX 3000
I dont know who you are Mister but
Im not stalking you or anybody else

CLAIRE
What about us

CYBER-VOX 3000
Okay maybe these two But I dont
need any trouble
(beat)
I just want to talk

Now it’s Claire and Willie’s turn to be confused This robot
was trying to kill them not a few hours ago

CLAIRE
Talk about what
INT COLORADOS HOUSE - KITCHEN
The Alien Under-Overlord eats slice of APPLE PIE in the

bombed out kitchen as he continues the meeting with Big
Brother

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Now that we’ve resolved our situation
let’s move on to the more pressing
problem We have no idea where the
human named Ethan Hayes escaped to

He takes a bite of pie

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
I could run a mindprobe on the female
we captured She may have the
information

BIG BROTHER
It’s not necessary

The Alien Leader takes another bite of the pie

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Are you sure you don’t want a piece of
this It’s mighty good for a frozen
pie--

Big Brother slams his enormous fist down crushing the
refrigerator like it was a tin can

BIG BROTHER
Enough

The Alien Under-Overlord rolls all his eyes Looks like one
of them has some anger management issues

BIG BROTHER
I have a way to track down the humans

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
I’m listening
EXT GAS STATION - DINER

Claire Willie and Cyber-Vox 3000 stand outside the diner
They all appear to be anxiously awaiting something

CLAIRE
Hes been in there for a long time

WILLIE
Wow I dont even piss that much

Suddenly the HUMAN SPROCKET descends from the heavens
landing by the group

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Fear not The Human Sprocket is here

He flashes his pearly whites at them with a pompous smile

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Guy Lannerman had to head back to his
office but he let me know that you
needed my help

They all look at him like hes insane

Its painfully obvious that The Human Sprocket is Guy
Lannerman He doesn’t even wear a maskor any kind of
disguise for that matter

CYBER-VOX 3000
Im confused Arent you

Claire shakes her head at Cyber-Vox 3000 to shut him up which
confuses the Cyborg even more

Willie on the other hand seems to enjoy this

WILLIE
(condescending)
Dont be confused Everyone knows that
Guy Lannerman is The Human Sprockets
best friend Right Sprocket

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Thats right my canine friend

WILLIE
I just have a question How did
Lannerman contact you I mean the
payphone doesnt work and I dont
recall him having a cellphone Not
that you could get a signal out here

anyway
The Human Sprocket awkwardly looks at the group

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
WellGuy and I haveUmmmmma way
of communicating with each other

WILLIE
Really How does that work

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
ErrrrTelepathy

WILLIE
Wow Telepathy So that means you can
contact him right now just by using
your mind

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Thats right

WILLIE

Cool Then could you do me a favor
Could you ask him to come back here
Because he forgot to put in his share
for the lunch tab

Sprockets poker face wanes

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
CrapIm always forgettingI mean
hes always forgetting things like
that

(beat)
How about I just cover him this time

The superhero reaches for his back pocket -- unfortunately
the costume has no pockets

WILLIE
A little light today too huh

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Im good for it

WILLIE
I bet you are

Claire is getting tired of this

CLAIRE
Can we just please go and save Ethan
and probably the world at this point

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Absolutely Claire

Seeing another hole Willie digs in

WILLIE
Wait a minute she didnt tell you her
name How did you know her name was
Claire

CYBER-VOX 3000
Thats a good point

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Because I know all Like I know where
they took your friend
(beat)
Jump on board and lets go save him

As Claire hops on the superheroes back Sprocket grabs hold
of Cyber-Vox 3000 who in turn holds tight to Willie and
Girlie-Doll

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
AWAY WE GO

CUT TO

INT SECRET UNDERWATER LAIR - CELLBLOCK 2A

Ethan Trent and Colorado are locked up in separate cells as
the diminutive sized GUARDS mill about outside the room

Trent and Colorado appear beaten down while inexplicably
Ethan is in a chipper mood

ETHAN
So how are we going to get out of this
scrape

COLORADO

We’re not Looks like we’re stuck here
for a while

TRENT
As if this isn’t already the longest
day of my life
ETHAN
What are you guys talking about
Youre Colorado Smith and Trent Evans
You can escape from a jail cell in
your sleep

COLORADO
I’m not feeling up to it right now

ETHAN
What about you Trent

TRENT
It’s complicated I don’t have time to
explain right now

Ethan doesn’t know what to make of this

ETHAN
Is this a joke You guys don’t give
up That’s your thing You never give
up

COLORADO

Well today we do kid

(beat)
To be honest I thought you’d be
pleased about this You said yourself
that you wanted a life of leisure A
place where the world can’t get to
you

Colorado lays back on his cot

COLORADO
Well be careful what you wish for
(beat)
Did your daddy ever tell you that

ETHAN
I never knew my Father

Ethan pulls out his snowglobe and stares at the idyllic
farmhouse inside

ETHAN
Apparently Katrina didn’t either

BARNABAS’ PRIVATE CHAMBERS

Barnabas stands in his underwear and socks as TINY HENCHMEN
present him with different clothing options They range from
the ultra-conservative to the avant-guard

One of the henchman holds out a suit made of 100 bills

BARNABAS
What do you think of this one

He turns to Katrina who watches from afar A pensive look on
her face

BARNABAS
Too ritzy

KATRINA
What are you planning on doing with
them

He smiles knowingly

BARNABAS
Any one of them in particular Your
father
(beat)
Trent

KATRINA
Just answer the question

He looks at his watch

BARNABAS

I’m sure they’ve escaped from their
cells by now So you know the routine
We’ll have another stand off in a few
they’11 kill some of my henchman and
then escape thinking they’ve foiled my
planBut this time they’1ll be wrong

(beat)
Provided of course you get me that
doll back

KATRINA
I’m working on it

BARNABAS
Work harder

Another suit arrives via a henchman This one is a little

more conservative

BARNABAS
No I’m not feeling it

Katrina reaches for her walkie
KATRINA (INTO WALKIE)
Cellblock 2A I need an update on the
prisoners

There’s a LONG PAUSE

BARNABAS
See what did I tell you--

CELLBLOCK GUARD (ON WALKIE)
Sorry about that I was in the
bathroom Hold on a second

Another short pause

CELLBLOCK GUARD (ON WALKIE)
Yep Everything’s fine I think you’re
dads sleeping

Katrina gets a concerned look on her face
KATRINA (INTO WALKIE)

Are you sure it’s not a dummy or
something

There some STATIC followed by the noise of a door opening

CELLBLOCK GUARD (ON WALKIE)
Hey Grandpa are you you

COLORADO (ON WALKIE)

(in the background)
Would you shut your mouth I’m trying
to sleep

The SQUEAL of steel on steel as the door slams shut

CELLBLOCK GUARD (ON WALKIE)
Yep It’s him Like I said
everything’s fine

This does nothing to alleviate Katrina’s concern

KATRINA
I’ve got to go check on something

As Katrina storms out of the room Barnabas gets excited
about the next suit brought to him

BARNABAS
Oh that’s the one Unless you think
it’ll make my butt look big

CELLBLOCK 2A

As Ethan paces in his cell Trent sits up from his cot and
turns to Colorado

TRENT
You know this is all your fault If
you were a better father and not
traveling the globe searching for
treasure all the time Katrina
wouldnt have turned out like this

COLORADO
My fault You have it all backwards
If you hadnt broken her heart at such
an impressionable age she wouldnt
have closed herself off to me and the
rest of the world

TRENT

You left her to live with your
brother A known lunatic What did you
expect

(beat)
I loved her but she was more
interested in conquering the world to
impress you than have a real
relationship

Trent kicks his cell door
TRENT
I guess today she’ll get her wish
NEARBY OBSERVATION ROOM

Katrina watches the monitor as Trent and Colorado continue to
go at it

COLORADO
Did you ever tell her you loved her

TRENT
NoDid you

Long pause

COLORADO
Not as much as I should have

A single tear traces down Katrinas cheek as Barnabas
explodes into the observation room

BARNABAS
It looks like our plan is back on
track The dolls coming to us
(beat)
Good call of yours to add that
tracking device I’m proud of you--

She races past him

KATRINA
Just leave me alone

Barnabas eyes fall to the monitor as a scowl appears on his
face

CUT TO

EXT SKIES OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST

The Human Sprocket and crew flies at supersonic speed toward
the lair The Pacific Ocean can be seen in the distance

CUT TO

EXT COLORADO’S HOUSE

Transformed into a large chopper Big Brother idles as the
alien spaceship hovers nearby

BIG BROTHER
LETS MOVE EM OUT

The chopper and saucer blast off toward the west

EXT THE PACIFIC OCEAN

As the superhero flies over the vast ocean Barnabas
underwater lair once again rises to the surface and the dome
splits open to let them in

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Hang on tight Here we go

INT SECRET UNDERWATER LAIR - HANGER BAY

The Human Sprocket lands in the center of the hanger right
beside Colorados propeller plane As he lets everyone off
him they are surrounded by the little henchmen

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Heads up team We’ve got company

Barnabas appears at the top of the large scaffolding He once
again has to speak loudly to be heard as he makes his way
down to the hanger floor

BARNABAS
Well if it isn’t The Human Sprocket
Don’t you have a cat to rescue from a
tree

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
I took care of that earlier in the
day

BARNABAS
I was being facetious

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Weve come for Ethan and the others

Barnabas finally arrives at the bottom

BARNABAS
Well I want the doll

Confused The Human Sprocket Willie and Cyber-Vox 300 all
turn to Claire

CLAIRE
You want me

BARNABAS
No The doll The Girlie-Doll
He points to the doll in Cyber-Vox 3000s arms

The superhero looks at Claire and Willie for support

BARNABAS
Give it to me and your friends are
free to go

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Thats all you want The doll And we
can have our friends back

BARNABAS
Yes Thats what I said Give me the
doll and you can all leave
(beat)
I dont want you here anyway

They SHRUG

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Okay

He turns to Cyber-Vox 3000

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Give him the doll

Cyber-Vox 3000 pulls Girlie-Doll close to his chest

CYBER-VOX 3000

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
No

CYBER-VOX 3000
ShesShes my friend

GIRLIE-DOLL
Friends forever and ever

CLAIRE
Its just a doll Give it to him and
we get our friends back

Hugging the doll close Cyber-Vox 3000 steps away from the

group

CYBER-VOX 3000

Shes not just a doll Shes my
friend My only friend Why should I
give her up just to save a bunch of
fleshbags like you

(beat)
Youre all going to be wiped from the
Earth in a nuclear holocaust in a few
more years anyway

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Give him the doll before I crush you
like a tin canYou tin can

CYBER-VOX 3000
Is violence always your solution

As The Human Sprocket reaches out to take the doll Claire
sees the anguish in Cyber-Vox 3000s eyes

CLAIRE
Wait Stop Hes right Were not
giving up the doll We do that were
just as bad as Barnabas

BARNABAS
Hey no need to get personal Im just
trying to exact a simple business
transaction

CLAIRE
Were not giving you the doll

BARNABAS
I already figured that out Toots I
an evil genius remember

m

CLAIRE
So now what

Theres an awkward silence as Barnabas considers something

CLAIRE
Hello
He snaps out of it
BARNABAS
Oh sorry Just had a thought about

something
(MORE)

BARNABAS (contd)
(beat)
Now I take the doll by force and kill
all of you

He pushes a button on a REMOTE CONTROL in his hand as the
device that Katrina installed in Girlie-Doll’s back activates
and --

-- an entire arsenal of WEAPONS break through the doll’s skin
and power up This is Girlie-Doll’s “Death Mode”

GIRLIE-DOLL
TARGETS ACQUIRED

The killer doll shoots Cyber-Vox 3000 in the shoulder with a
laser causing him to drop the doll to the tarmac

Unfazed by the fall Girlie-Doll gets up and turns locking
aim on Claire and Willie But just as its about to shoot --

-- The Human Sprocket leaps into the path and takes the full
barrage of firepower

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Run Ill hold it off

Scooping up Willie Claire grabs Cyber-Vox 3000 by the hand
and pulls the cyborg toward the side exit

CYBER-VOX 3000

The Human Sprocket grabs the killer doll and flings it across
the room into a brand spankin’ new FOOD CART The Food Cart
Vendor (Yes the same one) is knocked to the ground

FOOD CART VENDOR
Nooooooo Thees can’t-a be happening

The vendor seethes with anger

Barnabas watches with delight from upon high as he turns to
his Henchmen

BARNABAS
You know the drill boys

They cock their MINI-GUNS and fire at the fleeing trio

CELLBLOCK 2A

As GUNFIRE erupts in the outside corridor Ethan Trent and
Colorado look concerned

ETHAN
Is this how it ends

Suddenly the door bursts open --
-- as Katrina races in

TRENT
Have you come to finish us off

Katrina reveals a set of keys

KATRINA
Im here to rescue you

She unlocks Colorado’s cell first and gives him a big hug

COLORADO
Id like to make up for lost time
honey

KATRINA

Me too Daddy
Trent’s cell is next

KATRINA

Part of getting a second chance is
taking responsibility for the mess you
made in the first place

TRENT
That sounds like something I would
say

KATRINA

Do I get a second--

TRENT
Third

KATRINA
I mean third chance

TRENT
How do I know this isnt part of
another double-cross

KATRINA
It isbut I’m double-crossing my
uncle
They kiss
COLORADO

What about Ethan
Katrina crosses to his cell and unlocks it

KATRINA
That girlthe homely one The one
you love Shes here to save you

Embarrassed Ethan gives his snowglobe a nervous shake

ETHAN
II dont love her

KATRINA
Yes you do And maybe you should just
tell her that
(beat)
Unless you really want to end up
alone

CORRIDOR

Claire Willie and Cyber-Vox 3000 race down the hallways
looking for Ethan and the others

CYBER-VOX 3000
I still cant believe what that madman
did to her It doesn’t compute

CLAIRE
Would you keep it together

Willie flares his eyes at Claire

WILLIE
Wow look at you go girl I thought
you were a mouse turns out youre a
tiger

Curling his pawlike a paw He GROWLS like a cat

CLAIRE
Well I learned a few things today

WILLIE
Apparently so

Suddenly they collide with a group racing at top speed in the
opposite direction --

-- Its Ethan and the others

Ethan and Claire rub their bruised heads as they stare at one
another and suddenly blurt out --

ETHAN CLAIRE
I love you

ETHAN CLAIRE
You do

ETHAN CLAIRE
I love you too

ETHAN CLAIRE
But we hardly know each other

ETHAN CLAIRE
Theyll be time enough for that later

KATRINA
Would you two stop Youre giving me a
headache

Trent and Colorado glare at Katrina Shes falling back into
her bad habits

KATRINA
Alright Im sorry Just with the
world ending and all

Cyber-Vox 3000 interrupts

CYBER-VOX 3000
Weve got to save Girlie-Doll That
madman’s done something to her to turn
her against me

Katrina flashes a smile as she removes the REMOTE CONTROL
from her pocket Exactly like the one Barnabas is using to
currently control Girlie-Doll

KATRINA
Two can play that game--

Suddenly theres a massive explosion

WILLIE
What the

EXT SECRET UNDERWATER LAIR

The alien spaceship has blasted an enormous hole into the
Lairs dome as Big Brother transforms back into a robot and
jumps through

BIG BROTHER
DELETE WITH EXTREME PREJUDICE

He starts blasting up the Hanger Bay just as our heroes make
a mad dash for the propeller plane

TRENT
Secure the perimeter We don’t have
much time

All hell breaks loose

Tiny henchmen fight off aliens and the giant robot while The
Human Sprocket faces off against the killer doll armed to the
max with hi-tech weaponry

ON BIG BROTHER

Big Brother spies Cyber-Vox 3000 enter the arena and crosses
over to him with a few strides

BIG BROTHER
Great work CYBER-VOX 3000 The
Computer Big Brain will be most
pleased with you

Shocked everyone looks at Cyber-Vox 3000but hes confused
as well

CYBER-VOX 3000
I dont compute

BIG BROTHER
You lead us here Without you we would
have never found this place
(beat)
We followed your homing beacon

CYBER-VOX 3000
Homing beacon

Big Brother looks down at the humans with contempt

BIG BROTHER
Great job convincing these organics to
trust you
(beat)
Like I said I was watching you the
whole time Brilliant I’m sure
you’1l get an upgrade for this

Everyone backs away from Cyber-Vox 3000 Claire is by far the
most hurt

CLAIRE
You betrayed us

WILLIE
Hes a machine What did you expect

Cyber-Vox 3000 doesnt know what to do

CYBER-VOX 3000

BIG BROTHER
Now lets finish off the one called
Ethan Hayes and teleport out of here

Cyber-Vox 3000s Robo-Vision locks onto Ethan The screen
flashes “Terminate”

ETHAN
We trusted you

The look of disappointment in Ethans eyes is more than Cyber-
Vox 3000 can bare

CYBER-VOX 3000
NOOOOOOOOOO00N0ONN

He lunges at Big Brother pounding the gargantuan robot with
his fists

BIG BROTHER
What are you doing Obey your
programming

But the Cyborg has a new protocol

His diminutive size is his advantage as hes able to get into
the nooks and crannies of the giant robot and pull out cable
after cable -- One’s that are clearly labeled “DO NOT
UNPLUG”

BIG BROTHER
Desist Desist De

Big Brother falls to the concrete as --
-- the light in his eyes fades out

CYBER-VOX 3000
You’re term--

Without warning a LASER BLAST strikes Cyber-Vox 3000 in the
chest knocking him to the ground Hes badly damaged

ON ETHAN

As Ethan and the others look to where the blast originated --

-- The Alien Under-Overlord appears out of his spaceship with
a smoking laser blaster

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Where’s Ethan Hayes

The extraterrestrial’s multiple eyes lock on his mark
Ethan’s out in the open

An easy target

Ethan freezes in place as all the fighting in the hanger
suddenly grinds to a halt

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
You and me have some unfinished
business to take care of

ALIEN SOLIDER 1
Grammatically speaking it’s actually
“You and I”

Annoyed the alien leader tries to ignore the outburst

ETHAN
I don’t want or need anything from
you

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
How about some answers About your
past maybe

ETHAN
You don’t know anything about me

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Oh contrare I know quite a bit about
youand your mother
(beat)
As my underlings are quick to remind
me this isn’t our first visit to your
planet

ALIEN SOLIDER 1
It’s the fourth

The Leader grits his teeth

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
The first time washmmmmlet me
see Ahhhh yes twenty-two years ago
give or take a month

ALIEN SOLIDER 1
Twenty-two years and three and a half
months to be--

ZAP Having had enough the Alien Under-Overlord vaporizes
the overzealous soldier

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Where was I Oh yes twenty-two years
(beat)
Though it feels almost like yesterday
when we implanted the Accumlatron
Device behind your left ear when you
were still in your mother’s womb

Claire and the others stare at Ethan incredulously

CLAIRE
This creature is your father

The Alien Leader’s eyes almost bug from his body

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
EwwwwwwwnoI’m not your father
That’s ickyGross

(beat)
No Your mom and I just dated for a
while Besides at the time she was
pregnant with you by your deadbeat
dad I didn’t need that drama in my
life No way

He then abruptly turns to Claire

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
(nonchalant)
You on the other hand are one of our
AlienHuman Hybrids

CLAIRE
WHAT

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Oh yeah Your momwow Two words
“Party” “Girl”

Mortified Claire scans the legion of alien underlings
CLAIRE
Which one of you alien scumbags is my
Father
Embarrassed the Alien Under-Overlord chews his lower lips as
he points to the pile of dust that a moment ago was Alien

Soldier1

WILLIE
Awkward

Ethan suddenly chimes in

ETHAN
What do you want from me then

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
I thought I was clear about that I
want the enzyme that’s been collecting
in the Accumlatron implanted in your
brain so I can use it to subjugate the
entire Earth

Ethan removes the snowglobe from his pocket and grips it
tightly in his hand

ETHAN
Are you insane

The ornament shakes vigorously in his grasp

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
It’s not like you like it here Why do
you think we were able to collect so
much of the enzyme in the first place
You’re completely dissatisfied with
your life

The glittering colors swirl violently within the liquid

ETHAN
That doesn’t mean I’m going to let you
take over my planet

Ethan slams the snowglobe full force into the Aliens face
shattering it wide open and splashing the creatures eyes
with iridescent water

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
MY EYES All I see are rainbows

The smashed remains of the snowglobe crash to the floor at
their feet

It’s as time stands still

The hanger is absolutely silent as the significance and
enormity of this event is felt by --

TINY VOICE
Oh God Why

The cry emanates from the snowglobe wreckage at Ethan’s feet
and all eyes turn to the floor
A teeny-weeny family of FISH PEOPLE crawl out of the smashed

miniature farmhouse gasping for air

TEENY-WEENY FISH-MAN
Why Why is this happening We just
wanted to live a normal life--

As the entire fish family safely make their way to a large
puddle of the sparkly water on the floor Ethan stares at

them in abject horror

ETHAN
WHAT THE-—

Just then the Alien Under-Overlord reveals a detonator

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
You leave me no choice

And triggers it

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
I have set my ship to self-destruct
It will create a fireball so large it
will scorch the Earth and lay it to

ruin

TRENT
Where’s the bomb I said WHERE’S THE
BOMB

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
I just told you It’s on my ship

ETHAN
But youll only be killing yourself

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD

Im doing this so future generations
of my kind can travel here from the
stars to claim the rotting husk as our
new home world

(beat)
I will have died in battle which is a
great honor for my people

The alien soldiers hardly seem to concur with this

ALIEN SOLIDER 2
Since when

Barnabas is incensed

BARNABAS
Hey I paid a lot for this lair

The evil mastermind slaps the buttons on his remote control
Girlie-Doll spins around aiming at the alien leader

GIRLIE-DOLL
New target acquired

The doll lets loose a barrage of fire as chaos once again
erupts with henchmen and alien minion battling royale in the
hanger bay

ON KATRINA

Katrina has other plans for the doll As it continues its
attack on the Alien Under-Overlord she simultaneously
attempts to steer it toward Barnabas’ men

The doll gets caught between the mixed signals spinning back
and forth between the contradictory targetsback and
forthback and forth

ZZZZZZZAAAAAPPP CRACKLE -- The overload is too much as both
remote controls fry-out Katrina and Barnabas drop the
smoking controllers before they burn their hands off
Girlie-Doll has free will
GIRLIE-DOLL

When a friends in need help is on

the way
ON CYBER-VOX 3000

The doll races over to Cyber-Vox 3000 who lies on the ground
in shambles

GIRLIE-DOLL
You look like you need a friend

Barely holding it together the cyborg reaches out his bashed
up hand and touches the doll’s angelic face

CYBER-VOX 3000
It’s you You came back to me

ON ETHAN AND THE OTHERS
The Human Sprocket rejoins the heroes

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
How are we going to stop this

ETHAN
Cant you just throw the alien ship
into space

THE HUMAN SPROCKET
Unfortunately the ship’s made with
Triluminum It drains me of my power
If I get any closer to the ship I1l
be useless

WILLIE
Well isn’t that just convenient

ETHAN
Trent you know how to diffuse a bomb
You do it on a daily basis Maybe you
could deactivate this one

Trent looks at his watch

TRENT
No good Ethan Its already been 48
hours Im no good after that

COLORADO
Maybe I could pilot the ship into
space

Everyone looks at the old man like hes crazy

WILLIE
Youre an archeologist What do you
possibly know about alien technology

GIRLIE-DOLL (0S)
When help is needed look no further
than your new friend

They all turn to the doll standing by the wounded cyborg

CYBER-VOX 3000
Noplease dont leave me

GIRLIE-DOLL
The sooner you do something the
faster it gets done

Hydraulic oil leaks from the cyborg’s eye sockets

CYBER-VOX 3000
But you’re my only true friend

The doll turns to Cyber-Vox 3000 and kisses him on his chrome
forehead

GIRLIE-DOLL
Thanks for being my friend forever and

ever

The doll races toward the ship slipping past the alien leader
undetected

ON ETHAN

Ethan turns to his comrades

ETHAN
We need to get out of here

With Claire’s help they pick up Cyber-Vox 3000 and all head
for Colorado’s plane

Just as they make it to the aircraft --
-- Barnabas blocks their path Hes armed and dangerous

BARNABAS
Youre not going anywhere
(beat)
Besides I never got to tell you my
maniacally evil plan for stealing all
the world’s money

TRENT
We already figured it out

Barnabas glares at Katrina

BARNABAS
Did you tell them

KATRINA

ETHAN
Actually it was pretty obvious

BARNABAS
Really Obvious huh

WILLIE

Well yes If I may
(beat)

You shrunk your henchmen so they would
look like children so then you could
send them inside banks around the
world with their Girlie-Dolls that you
had Jasper and McMilligan unknowingly
manufacture as covert weapons because
who would ever suspect a child of
robbing a bank--

BARNABAS
ENOUGH

WILLIE
We were right weren’t we
(turns to the others)
We were right

COLORADO
Its over brother

BARNABAS
You were never my Brother You never
wanted to be Youd rather gallivant
around with those woman and that Asian
boy then spend time with me Your
flesh and blood

WILLIE
Asian boy

COLORADO
Well Im asking you to go with me
now
(beat)
Come with us

Barnabas looks to Katrina

BARNABAS
E tu Katrina

KATRINA
Hes my father My real father

A tear wells in Barnabas eye

BARNABAS
You really know how to hurt people

KATRINA
I learned it from you

BARNABAS
Well its too late to change

He aims the gun at her then at Colorado

BARNABAS
Only one bullet left So which one
deserves it more

His finger squeezes the trigger just as --

-- The Food Cart Vendor leaps at Barnabas and tackles him to
the ground punching him repeatedly

FOOD CART VENDOR

You promised me a safe place to work
No Elite Army Forces no falling
buildings You said-a my beloved cart
would be a safe

(beat)
But you lied-a to me Why did I-a
trust you

ETHAN
Lets get out of here

They all pile into the plane as Colorado preps it for take-
off

The engine revs as the aircraft speeds down the tarmac and
takes flight through the hole in the dome

A moment later the alien spaceship powers up

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Theyre stealing the ship

EXT SECRET UNDERWATER LAIR

The spaceship rockets straight upwards -- then abruptly
stops

The disc slowly turns as all its weapons bare down on the
secret lair

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Bummer

A barrage of lasers incinerates the Lair --

-- As Colorado’s plane flies off to safety one step ahead of
the fireball

No one notices as Barnabas ESCAPE POD jettisons into the
Ocean a few seconds before All eyes are on the Alien
Spaceship as it rockets out into space

INT ALIEN SPACESHIP - COMMAND BRIDGE

Girlie-Doll pilots the ship like a pro as the self-destruct
timer countdowns behind her

SHIP COMPUTER
Lo Ses

GIRLIE-DOLL
YIPPIE KI-YEAH--

KABLAM The ship explodes in a rainbow of color

EXT THE PACIFIC OCEAN - THE SKY’S ABOVE

Colorados plane rocks slightly from the blast but steadies
and continues on toward the mainland

INSIDE COLORADOS PLANE

As the others look on Claire cradles Cyber-Vox 3000 in her
arms

CYBER-VOX 3000
(weakly)
She did it She saved us all

Claire smiles down at the cyborg --
-- as he suddenly dematerializes in her arms

Everyone looks around in confusion -- What the hell
happened

Willie chimes in

WILLIE

You see Cyber-Vox 3000 was from a
future where Girlie-Doll was the
precursor of a race of sentient
robots

(to Ethan)
That’s why they sent him to our time
to terminate you because had you had
the chance you would have botched the
presentation and the Girlie-Dolls
would never have been manufactured

(beat)
But you didn’t get the chance to botch
the presentation so their future was
secured

(beat)
But then when Girlie-Doll sacrificed
herself just now it did in fact change
the timeline and thus the sentient
robots and Cyber-Vox 3000 never
existed

They all stare at him blankly

TRENT
Thank you Captain Exposition

Katrina turns to her Father

KATRINA
So where to now Dad Back to your
farm

COLORADO

You know that place was really boring
I thought Id check out the city life
for a while

KATRINA
I have a spare room

Colorado looks to Trent

just

COLORADO
Youll have to ask Trent if hes cool
with that
Trent smirks
TRENT
Trust me you don’t want to try me on

that one
Katrina smiles and kisses Trent

Ethan and Claire watch them with that same forlorn look
they’re both known for

WILLIE
Would you kiss already

They doand its nice

FADE TO

INT JASPER and MCMILLIGAN - DAYS LATER

Claire adjusts Ethan’s tie outside the boardroom as he
readies himself for his big presentation

ETHAN
Congratulations on your promotion Ms
Senior Vice President of Targeted
Marketing

CLAIRE
That’s soon to be Mrs Senior Vice
President of Targeted Marketing

She wiggles her left ring finger in front of him We clearly
see an ENGAGEMENT RING

CLAIRE
But let’s focus on you right now

ETHAN
Im going to pitch the hell out of
this one

Ethan looks down at the Poster in his hand --

-- Its for a new video game called “CYBER-NIHILATION 2
Cyber-Vox 3000s revolt

On the box cover is a picture of Cyber-Vox 3000 By his feet
is Girlie-Doll armed to the hilt with a army’s worth of high-
tech weapons

CLAIRE
Youll be great

Claire gives him a big kiss as a VOICE chimes in froma
nearby VENT

MR JASPER (0S)
Oh that’s nice

Lannerman races down the hall toward them

LANNERMAN
Sorry Im lateUmmmmmI had an
important phone call to make

Rolling her eyes Claire adjusts his buttondown shirt to
cover up The Human Sprocket costume poking out underneath

CLAIRE
Knock em dead boys

All three enter the boardroom to discover --
-- the FOOD CART VENDOR standing behind the conference table
Ethan is as confused as his colleagues

ETHAN
What are you doing here

FOOD CART VENDOR
I’m here to see you Mr Hayes

The Vendor speaks perfect English with not even the hint of
an accent

FOOD CART VENDOR
You know for someone who wants an
ordinary life you certainly are the
center of quite a bit of chaos
(beat)
Did you ever stop and wonder why

He reaches for something behind the table and reveals two
small white plates
Each one has a DONUT at its center One of the donuts
plain the other has a chocolate glaze with rainbow
sprinkles

FOOD CART VENDOR

Your entire life you’ve been under the
mistaken impression that all this was
happening around you and you were just
stuck in the middle of it all A
victim of bizarre circumstance

(beat)
Well I hate to break it to you but
all this is happening because of you

ETHAN
WhaWhat are you talking about

FOOD CART VENDOR
Have you ever heard the expression
“Life is what you make of it”

ETHAN
My mother used to tell me that

FOOD CART VENDOR

Well she was more right than she
could possibly fathom

(beat)
See you are not ordinary Ethan
Hayes You are actually quite extra-
ordinary and in control of the world
around you

ETHAN
You’re wrong I don’t have control
over anything That’s the problem

The Vendor smiles warmly

FOOD CART VENDOR
But you do Complete and utter
control

ETHAN
Who are you

FOOD CART VENDOR
I’m nobodyand I’m everybody
(beat)
I’m the twinkle in a child’s eye
(MORE )
FOOD CART VENDOR (contd)
The hairs on the back of your neck
I’m the first shooting star you see in
the nighttime sky

Claire suddenly finds her voice

CLAIRE
Are you God

FOOD CART VENDOR
NoI wish

LANNERMAN
You’re not

FOOD CART VENDOR
No Not him either
(beat)
I’m just here to offer your friend the
life he wants

He turns back to Ethan

FOOD CART VENDOR
I’ve been watching you your entire
life Ethan and now you’re finally
ready
(beat)
You just have to decide

The Vendor gestures to the chocolate glazed donut with
sprinkles --

FOOD CART VENDOR
Do you want a life filled with the
unexpected

-- Then to the plain donut

FOOD CART VENDOR
Or the life of calm serenity No
longer plagued by the random events
that make you so miserable

ETHAN
I can live a normal life With no
aliens no master criminals or robots
from the future

FOOD CART VENDOR
(re plain donut)
Exactly Make that choice and they’1l
cease to be along with everything else
that’s beyond the ordinary

Concerned Ethan turns to Lannerman --

ETHAN
You mean like superheroes

-- then to Claire

ETHAN
Or AlienHuman Hybrids

FOOD CART VENDOR
What’s it going to be

Ethan carefully considers the two pastries
Long pause
Then

ETHAN
Maybe I am the cause of all this chaos
like you said but you know what It
means that I’m always going to have
wild adventures

He turns back to his friends

ETHAN

And on those adventures I’m going to
meet some really great people who care
about me and will be there when I need
them most

(locks eyes with Claire)
It also means that there will never be
a dull moment

Ethan smiles at Claire

ETHAN
I’m okay with not being in control of
my life No one else is Why should I
be any different

Reaching down he scoops up the frosted donut with sprinkles
ETHAN
Besides it’s time to spice things up
a bit

Ethan takes a big bite as Claire wraps her arms around him
and kisses him while he chews

The Food Cart Vendor smiles

Then noticing the chocolate glaze on Claire’s face gestures
on his own chin

FOOD CART VENDOR
Claire you’ve got a little
chocolate

She’s too happy to care

FOOD CART VENDOR
Forget it

Satisfied the vendor exits the boardroom and WE follow him
down the corridor and into
THE ELEVATOR

As he makes the long journey to the bottom the elevator
stops at THE 5TH FLOOR

As the door opens we reveal --

-- The Alien Under-Overlord waiting He’s dressed in a lame
disguise

ALIEN UNDER-OVERLORD
Going up

FOOD CART VENDOR
Down

The doors close as the elevator continues to the LOBBY

EXT JASPER and MCMILLIGANS - COURTYARD

Exiting the building The Food Cart Vendor stops and watches
as a WILD PARADE goes by

A moment later a CREATURE (the same from the opening scene)
bursts from the ground and immediately terrorizes the
spectators

A fleet of Hi-Tech Helicopters suddenly swoop in as the ELITE
ARMY FORCE repel down on ropes to once again subdue the
monster

ELITE FORCE COMMANDER
Helio hold him with suppressing fire

There’s a pleasant tinkling to the Food Cart Vendor’s left
and he turns to see a brand new food cart stop by him

Operating the Cart is Barnabas

The evil mastermind smiles as he hands the vendor an APPLE
off his cart

BARNABAS
It’s a nice day for a parade

FOOD CART VENDOR
It certainly is

The Food Cart Vendor takes the fruit polishes it on his
shirt then takes a juicy bite as --

-- the END CREDITS roll
FADE TO BLACK

THE END
