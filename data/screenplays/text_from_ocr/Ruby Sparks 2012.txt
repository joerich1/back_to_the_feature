HARRY
What She can’t hear you
(Loud)
Don’t you want to have sex Like ever
again

He Loves Me 60911 Draft

CALVIN
The only reason girls ever want to sleep
with me is that they read my book in high
school

HARRY
So

CALVIN
So they’re not interested in me they’re
interested insome idea of me

HARRY
That’s why you have to work out So
they’1l want you for your body

CALVIN
(RE the machine)
What does this thing even do

HARRY
It turns you into a god Keep it up

CALVIN
I had a weird dream last night

INT THERAPIST’S OFFICE LATE AFTERNOON
CLOSE UP on Calvins face looking up at camera

CALVIN
I don’t know I don’t know I get an
idea a good idea like why don’t I
write about my dad And BAM I start
thinking that is the stupidest thing
ever who wants to read about “He was
disappointed in me bla bla bla” But
then I’m sitting there alone in front
of my typewriter all day and maybe I get
something to eat and all I can think
about is how every second I’m getting
older and he was right what am I doing
with my life And also Also I am
feeling ambivalent about Scotty

A beat We hold on Calvin

CALVIN (CONTD)

It’s true I’m feeling very ambivalent
about Scotty Dogs can be really
annoying He slobbers He chews things
He pees like a girl which for some
reason makes me feel inadequate But
then I feel bad because if I don’t love
him who will

(Pause)
Plus he needs to go outside a lot and it
breaks up my day Maybe that’s why I’m
not writing

We see DR ROSENTHAL Smart fifties He looks bemused
DR ROSENTHAL
Do you think that’s why you’re not

writing

Calvin has somehow managed to squish his body into a fetal
position in the chair

CALVIN
No

DR ROSENTHAL
Why do you think you’re not writing

CALVIN
--Can I have Bobby now

He Loves Me 60911 Draft 5

DR ROSENTHAL
Do you need Bobby now

CALVIN
Yes

Dr Rosenthal gets up and goes to a cabinet Calvin follows
him with his eyes

DR ROSENTHAL
Calvin When was the last time you saw a
friend

CALVIN
Harry yesterday

DR ROSENTHAL
Someone other than your brother

Calvin doesn’t answer Dr Rosenthal comes over and hands
him a plush teddy bear Bobby Calvin holds it Dr
Rosenthal goes back to his seat

DR ROSENTHAL (CONTD)
How was your date Tuesday

Calvin plays with Bobby’s ears

CALVIN
I don’t know that I’m really a dating
kind of person Just the prospect of
likechildhood stories relationship
histories “You’re depressed Oh my god
I’m depressed” Besides if I haven’t
written that day that’s all I can think
about Have you been giving Bobby to
your other patients

DR ROSENTHAL
No Bobby’s just for you

CALVIN
‘Cause he smells weird

DR ROSENTHAL
Calvin When you were deciding to get

Scotty what did we talk about What did
you say you hoped for Do you remember

Calvin mutters something

DR ROSENTHAL (CONTD)
A little louder please

He Loves Me 60911 Draft 6

CALVIN
That he would be awesome and we’d take
hikes and stuff And I would meet people
when they stopped to pet him But Scotty
gets scared when people try to pet him

DR ROSENTHAL
Does that embarrass you

CALVIN
(Big fat lie)
No

DR ROSENTHAL
--I want to give you a writing
assignment

CALVIN
I can’t write

DR ROSENTHAL
Okay This would just be for me Id
like you to write just a page about
someone who sees Scotty all slobbery and
scared and likes him anyway Just the
way he is Do you think you could do
that for me

Beat

CALVIN
Can it be bad

DR ROSENTHAL
I would like it to be very bad

And how can I go back in time and be him

Laughter Calvin stands in the wings

LANGDON THARP (CONTD)
This skinny high school drop out with
acne still on his chin gave us what very
well may become a classic American novel

Someone pats Calvin on the shoulder

LANGDON THARP (CONTD)

Since then we’ve had the pleasure of
reading his short stories and of course
last year’s novella “Breakfast for
Dinner” But it wasn’t until I sat down
to re-read his novel--

(Holding up the book)
--in this beautiful new edition--that I
remembered quite how good Calvin Weir-
Fields is

Langdon turns a strange edge to his voice
LANGDON THARP (CONTD)

Calvins arm

LATER

LATER

Mabel’s kneeling by the table as Calvin signs other people’s

FEMALE PROFESSOR
At first I resisted teaching your book
but the longer I considered it the more
I saw its corollary to Roth and Mailer
so I thought if I’m going to include
anyone contemporary it really must be
Calvin Weir-Fields--

Langdon chats up even more women

LANGDON THARP
People think of writing as cerebral but
its actually an incredibly physical
almost sensual act You should see me
write I’m like an Olympian With a pen

books She has a drink

LATER

MABEL
I was so in love with Charlie He was
like my ideal in high school I mean I
know he’s not real But he kind of is
right Like your name starts with “C”
and so does Charlie I mean it’s like
autobiographical right

away It’s easier if you’ve only ever
been mediocre When you’ve been to the
top it can kill you

platonic ideal of a girlfriend You can
be such a fucking prude

tell me what they are until whoops I’ve
broken them And then you get to be
disappointed with me

certain way it leads people on If you
take your clothes off at a party it
makes people think you’re a slut So Id
really prefer if you didn’t do that Is
that clear enough for you

all kinds of things about her And one
day I woke up and she--you--were living
in my house I can make you do anything
Because you’re not real

Ruby stares at him

RUBY
Youre sick Jesus you made me up

are not the center of the fucking
universe If this is how you think of
other people then you are in for a long
lonely fucked up life

He types something

it doesn’t belong to her

RUBY
Mon Dieu Arrete Arrete
Oh my god stop Stop
Calvin types something Ruby starts to sing and strip
The song continues over as we see
Calvin types Ruby does The hammers of the typewriter the
violence of his fingers hitting the keys Glimpses of the

words he writes and fast cuts of

--Ruby spinning and chanting “I love you I’ll never leave
you”

--Ruby down on her knees barking like a dog

--Ruby dancing and yelling “I love your mouth I love your
face I love your cock” etc

--Ruby jumping up and down and cheering “You’re a genius”
FINALLY

Calvin slams his hands down on the keyboard jamming the
letters Ruby collapses They are both shaking silent

After a long beat Calvin raises his head afraid to look at
her Ruby is on the ground barely breathing

Calvin edges toward her terrified She doesn’t move He
puts a tentative hand on her--and she JUMPS UP and runs out
of the room We hear the door slam behind her

Calvin is alone

creation From that moment on only Ruby
could determine the course her life She
was free

Calvin walks down the hall and places the manuscript in front
of the bedroom door On the title page is a post-it note

CALVIN
“One may read this and think it’s magic--
but falling in love is an act of magic
So is writing”

CALVIN (CONT’D)
“It was once said of Cather in the Rye
‘That rare miracle of fiction has again
come to pass a human being has been
created out of ink paper and the
imagination’ I am no JD Salinger but
I have witnessed a rare miracle Any
writer can attest in the luckiest
happiest state the words are not coming
from you but through you”

Calvin pauses looks around the room

CALVIN (CONT’D)
“She came to me wholly herself I was
just lucky enough to be there to catch
her”

It’s beautiful Calvin

CALVIN
Thank you

Dr ROSENTHAL
Most of my patients don’t take my
assignments this seriously

CALVIN
I know you hopedthat by writing this
I would realize that it never happened
That I imagined her Or went crazy for a
while And I understand why that would
be easier It would make more sense
But the thing is I don’t need to make
sense of this I don’t care if there’s
no good explanation If I’m going to
keep coming here I need you to believe
me anyway Take the leap At least
imagine how it could be true For me

DR ROSENTHAL
I will work on that
