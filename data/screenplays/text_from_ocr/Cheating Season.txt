inches struggling to stay inside
me Smell that rancid cologne you
refuse to get rid ofprobably

night dinner with your intolerable
parents Just bask in all that is

wife is acting distant or stopped
having sex with them or

that This time of year it’s
usually something cheaper dirtier
Like say finding two Victoria’s
Secret bags tucked in the corner of
your closet with a different set
of initials on each

Not everybody But enough to make
it shitty for the rest of us
