The grisly crime scene of the two dead Mexican Men who
lost the Mercedes has been sectioned off with yellow
Crime Scene” tape

It’s teeming with LAPD including a Forensics team with
PHOTOGRAPHER FINGER PRINT EXPERT AND CRIMINALIST who is
gathering fiber etc

Simmons and Murray use flashlights to examine the bodies

MURRAY
Tongues cut out

DETECTIVE SIMMONS
A lot of times the Mexican Mafia
will cut their victim’s tongues
out so they can’t repent their
sins to Jesus in the afterlife

DETECTIVE MURRAY
Nice touch

Simmons looks over the bodies

SIMMONS
My guess is these guys are Mexican
nationals

MURRAY
How do you figure

SIMMONS
(Shining flashlight)
Their boots Rudel’s Look at
the stitching Higher heel And
the skins - that’s endangered sea
turtle

MURRAY
How the hell do you know that

Simmons pulls his pant leg up to show off his dandies

SIMMONS
I know boots

MURRAY
The question is what got these
boys in so much trouble

SIMMONS
I don’t know but someone wanted
them quiet and wanted everyone to
know We wait for the forensics

Simmons looks at the dead man’s boots again

SIMMONS (CONT’D)
What size do you think those are

MURRAY
Can‘t be bigger than an eight

SIMMONS
Too bad

Murray and Simmons have a laugh and exit

us So what’s your plan

JIMMY
Go in and ask for my card back

PAUL
That’s it Seems a bit thin on

JIMMY
If he kept the gun he’s a bigger
idiot than you are Were here
for the car

PAUL
I’m just saying it couldn’t hurt
to ask
(Then)
What if he won’t give the card
back What’s the plan then

JIMMY
He probably doesn’t know the cards
value So we give him a choice -
Give it back or get jammed up by
gang units everyday Believe me
1 be reasonable He doesn’t
want the headache we can cause
