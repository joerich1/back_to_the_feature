“CITY ISLAND”

by

Raymond De Felitta
INT NORTH JERSEY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY DAY

A dank and cheerless cell-block Two Correctional Officers

examine the cells making sure all inmates are present One
of the officers is middle-aged tough but not scary-tough

This is VINCENT RIZZO

Vince Rizzo calls out the names of the prisoners as they
pass the cells

VINCE
NakovnyNapperforkNardella

This last name makes him pause He stops and stares into the
cell at a YOUNG INMATE who glowers back

VINCE (VO)
You asked me my worst secret My most
personal secret The secret of all my
secrets I get it

Vince stares at the young man named Nardella And then
reluctantly moves on

VINCE (VO)
But firstI’m Vince Rizzo and I want to begin
by telling you about where I live

CREDIT SEQUENCE
1 EXT CITY ISLAND THE BRONX DAY

Boats in the harbor Sunlight glinting off the water Old
clapboard houses set in what appears to be a genuine fishing
village All with a view of Manhattan

VINCE (VO)
City Island is a fishing village located
in the Bronx New York a place most people
associate with machete’s chop-shops the
Son of Sam gang warfare and the once great
New York Yankees

SHOTS OF FAMILIES LEAVING THEIR HOUSES FOR WORK

VINCE (VO)
The Bronx is all these things But it is also
home to the families that are the infra-
structure of the greatest city in the world—
the fireman the cab-drivers the sanitation
workers the secretaries the teachers and
the cops And the guys who work in our local
prisons Like myself
MORE SHOTS OF CITY ISLAND

The locals opening their shops in the morning bidding
each other a good day

VINCE (VO)
Now City Island is distinct from the rest
of the Bronx by virtue of being located on
it’s own two lane spit right in the middle
of the Sound Most people don’t believe it
until they see it And within the one square
mile that comprises all there is of City
Island lies another distinction That of the
muscle-sucker versus the clam digger

SHOTS OF THE BOAT WORKERS IN THE HARBOR

VINCE (VO)
The ‘muscle-sucker’ is an island resident who
moved here from somewhere else The ‘clam-
digger’ however was born and bred on City
Island preferably in the same house that’s
been handed down through the generations
Myself I’m a clam-digger There’s quite a
few of us Houses don’t go up for sale here
everyday My grandparents built our house in
1924 My dad grew up here So did I My kids
did too And this goes to the heart of why it
matters so much to a clam-digger to be what
he is and not some mussel-sucker

2 EXT RIZZO HOUSE DAY

The Rizzo family home at the end of the cul-de-sac which
sits on the water Quaint but not well kept A Jeep and a
Dodge Rambler sit on the ill-kept front lawn

VINCE (VO)
Because we represent family continuity
stability And in the Bronx-hell in the
world as we know it—these qualities are in
increasingly short supply In short the
world can be divided between clam-diggers and
mussel suckers Those who stay and those who
wander But I digress You asked me my worst
secret My most personal secret The secret
of all my secrets Welllike most of us I
guess I have a few

From an upstairs side-window we see SMOKE Not billowing
or threatening just gently emerging from the window
3 INT RIZZO HOUSE DAY

JOYCE RIZZO is getting dressed in a hurry Great body Savvy
eyes Men of a certain generation would call her

foxy Morning news blares from a television The bedroom

is small and unkempt

JOYCE
Vince You fall in or something--what

VINCE (0S)
Shower
Joyce makes a jerk-off motion

JOYCE
I need the blow-dryer

No response She goes to the bathroom door and bangs

4 INT BATHROOM

Although the shower is running VINCE RIZZO is NOT
showering He is smoking a cigarette leaning against the
tiny window and carefully blowing the smoke out On his

face bemusement As Joyce knocks--

VINCE
Christ

He carefully stashes his cigarette on the ledge grabs the
blow-dryer and opens the door a crack offering it

She grabs it
5 INT HALLWAYBEDROOM
Joyce As she moves down the hall she yells—

his eyes off it as he leaves his room

7 EXT RIZZO HOUSE

Vince Jr exits the house backpack slung over his
shoulder leans into Joyce’s jeep and starts it up

Across the street an OBESE WOMAN is leaving She’s over
three-hundred pounds but carries herself well even proudly
She waves at Vince Jr

OBESE WOMAN
Morning

He watches as she maneuvers herself into a small Honda and
drives away Vince Jr stares as the little car disappears
up the street

8 INT RIZZOS BEDROOM

Joyce is almost done with her hair Vince enters in a robe
Now we see him clearly for the first time

Vince Rizzo is forty-ish He is very much here and very
much somewhere else simultaneously Distraction is his mode
His face which is a perfect poem of puzzlement As he
dresses—
JOYCE
Call Vivian will ya Find out what
train shes taking

VINCE
She staying over

JOYCE
Spring Break Shes here all week
I thought we’d go out for Mexican tonight--

VINCE
Poker game

JOYCE (rolls her eyes)
Your daughter’s home from college
and all you can think about is--

VINCE
She’s here all week Just make an
early dinner and don’t let’s start
JOYCE
And this summer Vince You are
finishing that garage room and adding
another bathroom—even if we gotta get
you back on night shift to afford it

The slamming of the door as Joyce exits ends the
conversation Vince looks at himself in the mirror

His eyes seem to ask is this a bad marriage

another

10 EXT BRONX SCIENCE HIGH SCHOOL

in

A pack of Marlboro Lights and a bic at the ready He sets
his mother’s “note” on fire and lights a cigarette with it

prisoner named TONY NARDELLA

Twenty-one years of age Dark hair Brooding good looks He
stares sullenly back at Vince A beat Then Vince continues
with—

VINCE
Neirhoff Nieman Nosotrolanos

Nardella’s eyes follow Vince warily Then he looks away
17 EXT OFFICE BUILDING DAY

Joyce and Tanya smoke it up on the plaza in front of their
building

JOYCE
I checked his pockets No money—and I figure
Vince for a loser at cards So he might
really be playing poker

TANYA
I remember my Bernie’s poker-game
Jamie-Lee From Arkansas Still hard to
believe anyone other than Bill Clinton
coming from Arkansas

JOYCE
Besides Vince isn’t really the cheating
type You know I mean that takes energy
planning

TANYA
You yourself told me it’s been a year
since you’ve had sex

JOYCE (thinks shakes her head)
Yeah but Tanya a year without sex in
a long marriage that’s like a coffee break
TANYA

Okay So how come the poker game is always

when he’s pissed off at you

JOYCE
Good but not positive proof

I gotta theory

that most guys don’t bother to cheat cause
it’s too much trouble They like the sex up

here—
(she points to her head)

--more thanyou know And honestly What’s
the difference After awhile marriage is
really just about running a business

TANYA
Sooo empowered

JOYCE
Shut up

TANYA

Joyce—hello My husband sharing with somebody
else what he is legally bound to only share
with me And expecting me to believe he’s

playing poker

(pause then simply)
Even if it were a better lie
And her

Tanya smokes her cigarette Joyce looks away

JOYCE

I’d kill him

Is that what you did to Jamie-Lee

TANYA
Worse I let her keep Bernie

24 INT MALAKOV ACTING STUDIO
Twenty or so people--mostly under thirty MICHAEL MALAKOV a
bushy black-haired clad-in-black acting teacher is watching
an emotional scene being performed by two young actors a
MALE and FEMALE

MALE ACTOR

«take it all I don’t want it with

conditions Take the house—

FEMALE
Grandad’s house I WANT IT TO BURN

Sitting in the back off to himself is Vince He is as
out of place as he feels He clutches a copy of “An Actor
Prepares” as if holding onto a security blanket

Calmly Michael Malakov interrupts

MALAKOV
Let me stop you right there

The actors freeze This is not good
Pause

Pause

MALAKOV
Indication is no substitution for
articulation I’m feeling a lot of different
emotions but not one specific choice And
too much food on the table leaves the hungry
man starving with indecision It also creates
a dramatic vacuum which once entered is
very hard to disengage from Our favorite
number One One premise one emotion one
action one result one step at a time

The two actors nod

FEMALE ACTOR

Thank you

The students applaud When theyre done—

MALAKOV
Everybody standstretchthank Mr
Strasberg

THE CLASS
Thank you Mr Strasberg

MALAKOV
And before you go here is your assignment
Stand in a row on stage Quick hurry

The students jump on to the stage and form a row

MALAKOV
Now twist into a semi-circle
Keep going until you are each face to face
with another of your speciesand meet
the person who stands across from you

People smile shake hands Vince is standing across from
a wondrously alluring woman named MOLLY CHARLESWORTH She
speaks with exaggerated formality

MOLLY
Molly Charlesworth A pleasure

VINCE
Yeah Vince Rizzo

She smiles at him He looks away uncomfortably

MALAKOV
Your assignment for next week is share
the worst secret of your life with each
other The most personal secret The secret
Class is over
eyed

of all your secrets You can do so without
fear of intimacy issues or any of that
bullshit because you are in fact protected
by the Statute of Actors Limitations to wit
actors can keep secrets like nobody else
because only they have secrets that are even
more damaging

(laughter from the class)
What will you do with your new friend’s
secret You will use it to find the courage
to dramatize the telling of your own worst
secret The very thing that you right now
are hiding and protecting with your very
life will soon become a monologue for all
of us to hear I look forward to a litany of
devastation next Friday after which we’1l
all drink too much and applaud ourselves at
the West Bank

Vince and Molly look at each other wide-

MOLLY
Id love to be drunk before we do this but
the chance of a blackout and the
resulting loss of memory precludes that
Don’t you think

Vince nods frozen at the strange attractive young woman

25 INT EMPIRE DINER

They each munch way-too-big burgers Vince’s copy of
“An Actor Prepares” sits on the table between them

MOLLY
Then the day-maid came into my room and
said Your father didnt kill himself
He tried to kill your mother Only my
mother was away—and my father was so drunk
he thought their wedding portrait had come
to life So the cops took him in my bro-
ther and I were sent to live with my Aunt
on her plantation in Hawaii where my bro-
ther turned to opium by-products I was
shuttled to a series of dusty and best
forgotten Swiss boarding schools and my
mother went into re-hab at Silver Hill where
she met a patient who was a bricklayer and
fell in love with him and married him twice
(pause then)
This was pre-Liz Taylor and Larry Fortensky

Pause She eats a pickle

VINCE
Jesus
(and then)
So what happened to your brother

MOLLY (shakes her head)
No enough of that I don’t like it for
this purpose You see the problem is
Ive told that secret a million
times--I audition with it in fact

(and then)
All right Vincent your turn I’m stuck

VINCE
Huh
(pause thinks)
Is it possible that I don’t have one

MOLLY
No That would make you too healthy to want
to be an actor Come on now think

VINCE
Well Okay

(pause then)
Well one thing Right here My wife thinks
I gotta poker game tonight She don’t know
where I am

MOLLY
You mean instead of telling her you’re
enrolled in a night class you tell her
you’re out gambling Is that better
VINCE
Well it’s hard to explain butyeah She
wouldn’t go for me wanting to be an actor

MOLLY (still puzzled)
How terribly refreshing I mean to have a
celebrity manqué in the family and to not
encourage your own reality show Shunning
celebrity How un-now

VINCE
Yeah I guess so

MOLLY
So tell it to me Like you were confessing
it
VINCE
Okay

(gamely)
I’m Vince Rizzo andI want to tell you
my worst secret My most personal secret

See my wifeshe thinks I got a poker game

When in fact
(pause)
When in fact
(pause)
you know what This is bullshit

Molly looks happily taken aback

MOLLY
You mean you could do worse

VINCE (nods)
Yeah Guess so

MOLLY
Try me
VINCE
Really I meanwe don’t hardly know each
other
MOLLY
I know Isn’t it lovely
Vince’s face yes this is the right way to look at it
VINCE
I just met my son
MOLLY
Where
VINCE
In uhthe facility where I work
(and then)

I’m a corrections officer

MOLLY (pause--then)
You’re a prison guard

VINCE (hates this term)
Yeah sorta

MOLLY
And how old is your son

So

VINCE

Guess he’d betwenty-somethin’ by now
(and then)

Tony His name’s Tony

Vince reaches into his pocket and pulls out
TONY’S MUGSHOT
He hands it to Molly who stares at it A long stare Then--

MOLLY
This is brilliant How old were you when--

VINCE

Early twenties Just a kid myself really
(pause then uncomfortably)

His mom was older

MOLLY
And how did you recognize him

VINCE
His name popped out on his rap sheet
Nardella Which was Nan--his mom’s--name
Born in Camden—that’s where she lived Not
that I was there at the time

(starkly)
I took off

MOLLY
A child conceived in love but
destined to a life of crime

VINCE
He stole a car I meandoesn’t exactly
make him a criminal right

MOLLY
What kind of car

VINCE (thinks)
Chevy Impala

MOLLY
No Anyway what else

(long pause then excitedly)
You’ve never told your current wife about
him Or about his mother Or about any of it

VINCE (long pause then)
I meant to It was justnever the
right time

He stares off unable to comprehend what’s happened to him
in the past day Molly stares at him fascinated

26 INT RIZZO HOUSE

Joyce and Vivian watch “American Idol” glassy eyed
and bored Vivian’s cell phone rings She answers

VIVIAN
Hi No Can’t talk now Maybe
Monday Give my shift to Autumn Bye

JOYCE

VIVIAN

Joyce accepts this trusting and disinterested
27 INT VINCE JRs ROOM

Vince Jr is on the internet glassy-eyed All kinds of
sex sights are searched like HOT HORNY BABES BLONDE
BITCHES HOTTEST YOUNG MODELS He stares numbly at the
multiplying images of tiny-wasted skinny young babes

No interest in his eyes at all He types in FAT CHICKS
BRONX NEW YORK Pause Hundreds—no thousands—of hits

He starts scrolling madly through the images Pauses as he
sees something strange Clicks

A moment later an image appears of a woman He stares at
it At first scared and then amazed as he sees that—

IT’S THE OBESE WOMAN FROM NEXT DOOR
Vince Jr double-clicks and the woman’s website opens up
It’s an elaborate site The woman’s name is DENISE

DENISE (on internet)
Hi I’m Denise and I’m a proud BBW That’s
“big beautiful woman” for those of you
new to this I’m Five-eight three-hundred
and fifty pounds and I think eating and being
a big beautiful woman is the sexiest thing in
the world

Vince Jr is both amazed and appalled by what he’s seeing
and hearing After a moment he exits the sight Stands
up fast—like he’s afraid of being caught

He walks to the window and looks out at—

28 DENISE’S HOUSE

across the way A light is on in the kitchen He sees
her large silhouette moving about the room In his eyes
shame and fascination

29 EXT 42° STREET NIGHT
Vince and Molly walking west She’s enjoying his secret

MOLLY
And there stand you ready to save—
what’s his name

VINCE (little smile)
Tony Tony Nardella

MOLLY
Ready to save Tony Nardella from the
misery of the last mile and take him
into the bosom of your warm-hearted family

VINCE
Unh-uh no way Don’t think so

MOLLY
Why not

VINCE
My wife for one thing She’d flip

MOLLY
She thinks you were a virgin when
you met

VINCE
Not exactly But she don’t think I was
a father either Joyce’s got pretty
firm opinions on things It’s sorta her
best quality and her worst—you know--all
in one She’s one tough woman and she’11l
fight like a pitbull for you if she’s
on your side

MOLLY
She sounds likea real dame

VINCE (nods)
Yeah A real dame Looks great too
(pause then)
I don’t knowwe ain’t exactly friends
anymore I don’t know when it happened
MOLLY (pause then)

The re-appearance of your secret love child

might well provide the solution

VINCE
How

They stop walking Molly examines Vince Can’t resist
touching his shoulders a little as she talks

MOLLY
He’1l provide a dangerous symbol of
your own virility She’1ll be reminded
of the very things that attracted her to

you to begin with You see the Vincent she
didn’t really know is the Vincent that she

secretly wants back

VINCE
Does that make sense

MOLLY
No But women are emotionally incoherent
It’s one of our defining characteristics

Molly watching Vince’s face she can see he’s considering
it She pulls out a pen jots her phone number on the back

of a card
MOLLY (cont )
I do some of my best work via cellular
Call me Vincent But only on a whim

And she hands her number to him and disappears into the
starry night Alone Vince smiles at her as she leaves

30 EXT CITY ISLAND MORNING
The boats in the harbor Pan across to the Rizzo house

A plume of cigarette smoke comes out of the upstairs
bathroom window We hear Vince coughing

Downstairs on the front porch lies Vince Jr sleeping
One eye opens as—

DENISE EXITS HER HOUSE
She sees Vince Jr smiles and waves

Vince Jr quickly shuts his eye pretending not to have

seen But once she walks away he opens his eyes again and

stares after her

31 INT BATHROOM

Vince smokes blows it out the window He reads a book

frustration Vince turns and storms out

JOYCE
The great communicator Forget it

33 EXT RIZZO HOUSE

Vince steps over Vince Jr who is still lying on the
porch As he gets into the Dodge Rambler—

VINCE
You sleep outside last night

VINCE JR
Actually I stayed at the Plaza Hotel
and did heroin with a bunch of prostitutes

eyes Why does the prison guard keep staring at him

35 INT VISITORS STATION

Tony Nardella stands there puzzled Vince approaches
the glass wall that separates them Into the microphone--

VINCE

Pause Tony Nardella is not given to verbosity

TONY
So Anything else

VINCE (looking away)

I spoke to Warden Amboy And uh
(pause then)

You’re bein’ released to me You’1l

Tony’s face this sounds fishy to say the least
Music takes us through—

36 EXT PRISON PARKING LOT

Vince escorts Tony still wearing handcuffs but now in his

street clothes—jeans boots leather jacket In his
a look of suspicion

eyes

37 INT DODGE RAMBLER

Vince driving Tony staring ahead frozen in fear We
see that his handcuffs are still on and chained to
the door of the car

Tony stares straight ahead miserable and afraid

38 EXT CITY ISLAND AVENUE

The Dodge Rambler drives down the main drag and turns onto
the Rizzo’s block

39 INT DODGE RAMBLER
As Vince drives down his block—
VINCE
We got this little house in the back
Really a boatshed You can stay there
(musing)
In fact I’m thinking we can do a

little deal with each other—you know
I do you a favor you do me a favor

Tony’s eyes not good
40 EXT RIZZO HOUSE

Vince Jr smokes a cigarette Sees the Rambler Stubs
it out and runs into the house—

41 BATHROOM

Up the stairs and into the bathroom where he speed-brushes
his teeth He reaches inside a closet for a towel

Vince’s acting book falls from its hiding place Vince
Jr stares at it Opens it and sees the mugshot of Tony

Vince Jr looks puzzled
42 INT RAMBLER
Vince pulls up to his house and parks Stops and looks
at his son
TONY (uncomfortably)
What

VINCE (pause then)
Nothin’

Vince smiles goofily He’s with his long lost son

TONY
Can I ask youlikewhy I’m chained
to a Dodge

VINCE
I’1l unchain you in minute Soon as
you calm down First I wanna tell you
something

(breathes then)
See Tony this is my home My home which
my grandparents built and which I share
with my family

TONY
You got them chained up in the house
too

VINCE (ignores this)
You’re gonna get real food and a nice
place to live for the first time in
three years

TONY
And all of this is because you knew
my bitch mother

VINCE
Well Nan was difficult but she was
also-

TONY
A drunk and a whore

VINCE
No Why would you say that

TONY
She used to punish me for not boosting
cases of Vodka from the liquor store
where I worked by screwing my friends
Which base does “drunk and whore” not
cover

VINCE (gingerly)
Don’t you have any nice memories of her

TONY (sullenly)
At least she was around My father
left before I was born

Pause Then--
VINCE
That all you know about him

TONY
He’s dead

Vince’s eyes say so that’s what she told him

VINCE
That’s too bad

TONY
Only thing that’s too bad is I didn’t
get to visit his deathbed and dance
on his ugly face for leaving me with
that bitch

Vince’s face taking in their fatherson vibe

43 EXT RIZZO HOUSE

Vince gets out Unchains Tony but then rechains him to his
own wrist

TONY

away or anything before you see what a
nice set-up I’m offerin’ you

TONY
Run away Gee Why would I do that

They walk chain in chain down the side of the house

VINCE
I started building it a couple of
summers ago but got busy with other
things So this is where our little deal
comes in

(pause)
You’re gonna help me build a bathroom

TONY
Scuse me

VINCE
My wife’s been wanting me to add a
bathroom and I saw on your sheet that
your last job was as a handyman So
that’s the deal Thirty days back here

wage and then you get to go wherever the
hell you want with a few bucks in your
pocket

Sees that Vince is for real

TONY
How’m I supposed to build a bathroom
with handcuffs on me

VINCE
Sorry

Just don’t go running away If you do
I’1l find you and personally toss your
ass back in the cage And they won’t be
kiddin’—you’1l be back in for a long
stretch Okay Tony

TONY (pause then)
Whatever

VINCE
Say ‘Okay Vince I promise you that’

TONY (by rote)
‘Okay Vince I promise you that’

VINCE
‘And thank you for getting my ass outta
the cage’ Come on

TONY (reluctantly)
Thanks for getting my ass outta the
cage

VINCE
And no more talkin’ shit about your
mother Maybe she wasn’t perfect but
she wasshe was

TONY
A good lay

Vince smiles This makes Tony smile too Vince unlocks the
handcuffs Then he pulls out a pack of cigarettes and

lights one

The sound of A CAR APPROACHING Panic in Vince’s eyes

Vince tokes

VINCE
Shit My wife

TONY
Is that what you call her ‘Shit my

Just say we’re old friends

TONY

VINCE

Joyce’s face turning colors
47 EXT BACK OF RIZZO HOUSE

Tony sits in the garage the door open He’s listening to a
MAJOR ARGUMENT being played out a few feet away None of it
is going as planned

VINCE AND JOYCE are in the kitchen but the backdoor is open
We see them coming and going as the raging argument
continues

JOYCE
You bring some filthy biker
into my home without even so
much as asking me—

VINCE
He happens to be a nice young
man and he’s working for his board

JOYCE
Where’d you meet this guy anyway

VINCE
He was getting’ outta jail in a month
so I told them I’d take responsibility

JOYCE
He’s a criminal What Vince you just
picked a con at random to bring into

Jr in the window
JOYCE (0S)

Aggh—my brain tumor

Tony’s eyes go wide What the hell kind of family is this

JOYCE

VINCE
Actually sweetie he has a point I
mean that’s what you were getting
at right You were circling the airport
a little but—

JOYCE
I don’t care if you had sex with her or
not Why’re you two ganging up on me

Vince Jr pleased with himself for having jumpstarted
the argument watches it like a Tennis match

VINCE
Honey please after twenty years
I know where you’re headed before
even you do

JOYCE
Well that must be real boring for
you Vince Really Who knew I
was failing to keep you entertained
all these years

VIVIAN
Oh Mom he didn’t mean it like—

JOYCE
Now you’re on his side too huh

VIVIAN
Why does it have to be about “sides”
I’m just saying that dad says things
in a stupid way and--

VINCE
I’m stupid huh Listen maybe you talk
to your college friends like that--
JOYCE
Good Vince blame her for getting
a real education—

VIVIAN
Stop

Everyone looks at their plates privately wounded
TONY

watches the family as they recede into their own thoughts
He continues shoveling food down Long pause Then—

VINCE JR
I’m sorry Vivian

VIVIAN
Thank you

VINCE JR
Can I ask you a question

VIVIAN
What

VINCE JR (pause then)
Are your breasts continuing to grow
Because to my eye they’re much larger
now than they used to be

CHAOS Everyone screaming at once Tony can’t believe what
he’s seeing
VINCE (boiling over)
How dare you speak to her like that

JOYCE
Upstairs Go to your room

VINCE JR
“Go to your room” Pretty lame mom

VINCE
Don’t you sass your mother Go to your

Vince Jr looks thrilled He bolts up the stairs singing—

Pause Temporary calm Tony continues to eat not making
eye contact but CHECKING OUT EVERYONE SURREPTITIOUSLY His
eyes travel to Vivian’s chest Then to Vince

Vince is also looking at his daughter’s chest

Now Joyce sees it Tony and Joyce both stare at Vince
staring at Vivian’s chest Finally Vivian sees what’s
going on

VIVIAN

off to spend with her family and you
gotta screw it up

VINCE

not interested And worried too Then—

Vince Jr types in “DENISEBBWCOM” and waits A moment
later there’s the fat neighbor He stares both fascinated
and ashamed
DENISE (on internet)
Hi I’m Denise and I’m a proud BBW
That’s “big beautiful woman” for those
of you new to this I’m Five-eight
three-hundred and fifty pounds and I
think eating and being a big beautiful
woman is the sexiest thing in the world

Wasn’t like I was any help

(pause then)
Only thing is he still don’t knowwho I
am

MOLLY
You must tell him Vincent Think
of the drama of the moment On the
other hand think of the drama of
not telling him Wait Don’t think
of anything for Godssake

(she closes her eyes—and then)
No You must tell him The longer
he doesn’t know your true identity
the greater the sense of betrayal
He’s been betrayed enough

VINCE (guiltily)
All started with me walkin’ out on him

MOLLY
No don’t succumb to self-flagellation
I mean I understand it—it’s wonderfully
Catholic but you’re beyond it You’ve
opened up your home to a convicted
felon You’ve even shown him great trust
by leaving him alone with your family

VINCE (dawning)
Jesus
She inhales

MOLLY

Because he’s your blood and if you can’t
trust your blood what the hell can you
trust Now you must take the final step

and reveal his birthright to him

satisfied that the decision is correct

Smiles

at Vince A beat He smiles back at her One of those shared
smiles that could go just about anywhere

Vince lowers his eyes first They fall on her copy of

‘BACKSTAGE’

sitting on the table between them

VINCE
What’s that

MOLLY

Ugh It’s an addiction “Backstage”--
the Wall Street Journal for struggling

actors You peruse it for news on

open calls for parts you won’t get

in projects that are never made
For instance

(as she opens it and reads)

Open call Male age 30-50 working-
class type no agency rep required
Monday 9 am Canal Street Armory

(pause thoughtfully)

Hm That one might be good for you

VINCE
What happens—how’s it work

MOLLY
You’ve never auditioned

Oh Vincent it’s dreadful You go

and wait in a room crowded with
people who look vaguely familiar
march you in They stare at you
hate you You sing and dance and
show off all of the talent that
once thrilled your mother and

They
They

father They make faces Sometimes

they ask a question—very rarely

You’re dismissed You leave feeling

like a failure

VINCE
Soundsscary

Having said thatyou really should
go on this one It sounds perfect
for you

She tears out the ad Gives it to Vince who reads it
Intrigued

function in the New York area where

64 INT ROOSEVELT ISLAND TRAM NIGHT

Molly and Vince are the only two on the tram Vince
looks out a little mystified at where he is and
how he got here As she stares out at the stars—

MOLLY
The answers are all there Don’t worry
Vincent For some reason you’re very
close to God right now I don’t know
whybut you can feel it in the stars
(dawning)
Of course Mercury’s in retrograde

VINCE
Mercury’s a what

MOLLY
Mercury—the wing-footed messenger
Represents communication and the process
of life Retrograde traveling
backwards It happens three or four
times a year—
and since all backward movement symbol-
izes a return to source our atten-
tions turn towards unfinished business
It can be a fine time for completing
things Re-connecting Settling
accounts (and then)
Letting the stars do their plentiful
work

Vince looking at her Something about her way

VINCE
Is it kinda strange that what you
say makes sense to me

MOLLY (shakes head no—then)
Yes But everything’s strange Vincent
When you think of it acting is one
of the strangest things a person could
choose to do with themselves Pretending
to be another person—who was dreamed
up by a third party It’s like agreeing
to be a marionette

Vince turns this around in his mind

VINCE
Why you an actress then

MOLLY
Oh really What else could I do
What other profession would accommodate
my behavioral problems

VINCE (smiles)
Yeah Sort of like getting paid for
being a screw-up

MOLLY
Perfect

They both look off at the view
65 EXT RIZZO BACKYARD NIGHT

Joyce and Tony

JOYCE (resigned)
I feel like I spend my whole life trying
to please everyone and all it does is
make ‘em mad My son--Jesus
what a pill he’s becomin’ And Vivian
Twenty years of working for that law
firm so I could put away enough for her
to go to law school after she graduates
Youd think she’d at least talk to me
about it I ask her about her classes

and she just shrugs “Whatever” And
Vince and his ‘poker game’ Does he
think I buy that crap

TONY (a little shrug)
I grew up with a mother and no father
And my mother hated my father so much
for leaving that she took it out on me
cause I reminded her of him

Joyce lights another cigarette Stares
and blows smoke

JOYCE

off into the yard

He started that room three years ago

Bought enough wood
a forest That was

and junk to build
gonna be his new

career—-building stuff He was all
gung-ho and thenpffffttt

He gets discouraged when things take
too long Like more than an hour

Tony clutches himself against the cool

Vince Jr scrambles to his feet hops over a hedge and runs
into his house

69 EXT ROOSEVELT ISLAND NIGHT

Molly and Vince sitting on a bench looking at the glorious
Manhattan view
VINCE
So You been thinkin’ anymore about
your “worst secret”

MOLLY
I think about it all the time

VINCE
You probably got so many interesting
secrets—
He lets it hang

MOLLY
Scads—

VINCE
--it’s hard to tell which one’s the
best

(pause then)
I gonna get to hear it I don’t mean
to press you or nothin’ but we got
class comin’ up in a few days and

MOLLY
Where do you live Vincent

VINCE
The Bronx

MOLLY
No thonx

VINCE
Huh

MOLLY
Nothing Ogden Nash Skip it
For all I know the Bronx is lovely
VINCE
Well my part of it is S’called City
Island Old fishing village

MOLLY
Really

(this appeals to her)
CityIsland On the one hand a paradox—
a peaceful island located within
the world’s busiest city Further the
words stand in stark relief from each
other—“city” so short and abrupt and
definite and “island”—exotic unknowable
and with the silent “s”

VINCE
I never really thought about it that
way It’s a great spot though—my
grandparents built the house and passed
it down Once you live there you can’t
really think of moving anywhere else

MOLLY
Every busy city needs an island of
peace Like every busy soul needs a

place of repose A place where we hide
from our own frantic stories while
theymadly insanely obsessively pursue
us

Pause This last was said with a vigor that denotes to Vince
another side of Molly another angle He looks at her
unafraid and unbashful Molly looks him right in the eyes
Then she opens her purse and pulls out an envelope She
hands it to Vince
MOLLY
There it is Vincent My secret

He begins to open the envelope But she stops him

MOLLY
No Not yet I need it to stay mine for
just a little longer Once you know it
it’s no longer truly a secret
(mysteriously)
There’1l be a moment when it’s obvious
Carry it with you The moment could come
at anytime

Molly and Vince smile at each other A beat As they look
out at the glittering view of Manhattan—

MOLLY
Oh Vincent What a wonderful time to
have not disappeared

How’s that

VINCE
Well here on City Island if you come
from somewhere else you’re known as a
‘muscle-sucker’ But if you’re born and
raised here you’re a ‘clam-digger’ Old
City Island custom

Tony stares at Vince like who is this guy

TONY
Huh

As Tony grabs another bag we see the expression on Vince’s
face he and Tony are not connecting

78 INT GARAGE LATER

Vince lights up blowing the smoke through the tiny window
He notices Tony staring at the poster of “The Godfather”

VINCE
If I could come back as some-body
different it’d be him

TONY (warily)
Don Corleone

VINCE
No Brando

(and then)
Always kinda thought being an actor
is something I could do Fact I’m
takin’ this acting class in the city
I guess it’s kind of stupid-I ain’t
even told my wife She thinks I gotta
poker game

Tony’s eyes remembering Joyce’s accusation of the night
before
TONY
And all you really got goin’ is
an acting class

VINCE
Shh Don’t tell no-one

He offers a cigarette to Tony who refuses it

TONY
I quit inside

VINCE
Yeah they got that rule now Must suck

TONY
Plenty other things that are worse

Pause Vince’s eyes guilty at what he knows must go on

VINCE
We try to keep an eye on things It’s
hard—so many guys so many groups and
gangs But we see somethin’ goin’ on
that we don’t like believe you me--

TONY (a little icy)
I took care of myself

VINCE
Oh yeah

TONY (shrugs)
I figured as soon as I got to
Southcourt I had to act more
psycho than everyone else I
mean I was younger so I had
to watch myself

Vince is interested in this He peers at Tony

VINCE
What’d you do

TONY
I went right up to the ugliest guy
I could find and said “I think I’m
pissed off with you but I don’t know
why Do I got a reason”

VINCE (smiles)
No shit

TONY
Yeah I was like gimme your top ten
reasons you’re a piece of shit and I’1l
let you know when somethin’ rings a

bell Just don’t lie to me and don’t
figure me for one of your sissy-boys
who’re gonna put out for you you sadly
deformed
excuse for humanity posing as a piece of
prison garbage

(pause he shrugs)
It worked They thought I was psycho I
was justacting

Tony turns away Keeps working But Vince looks at Tony
Admiration in his eyes And yearning to connect to him

79 INT RIZZO HOUSE

Tony wanders over to the living room where he sees

TINY AREA ON THE SIDE OF THE GARAGE

the “OPEN CALL” ad He blanches when he sees Tony stubbing
his cigarette out

TONY

Well between you and me okay

(Tony nods)

No privacy here They regard each other with mutual
frustration

VINCE JR (agitated)

Taking a walk

VINCE JR

crack delivery from a group of black friends

Marlon Brando’s accent from “The Godfather”

VINCE (reading from script)
“So make no mistake Joey From here
on out I’m watching you What you
do Who you do Was itno Watch it
cause Frankie Grinucci has eyes in

the voice on the other end of the phone

CASTING DIRECTOR
Absolutelyabsolutelyabsolutely
(and then)
I’ll try

She motions for Vince to come back

CASTING DIRECTOR
Are you an actor Mr Rizzo

Vince looks around
VINCE

officer

CASTING DIRECTOR
A prison guard

VINCE
Guess you could call it that

CASTING DIRECTOR
Where do you work

VINCE
North Jersey State Correctional

CASTING DIRECTOR
That one of thosecountry club prisons

Vince can’t help but be slightly offended Perhaps this is
what was intended

VINCE
I wouldn’t call it that sir not
by a longshot We got people in there
wholemme put it this way if you
could see inside their minds and
what they’re thinkingyou wouldn’t
be thinking of no golf game

CASTING DIRECTOR
Tell me more about what you do
What’s a typical day like

VINCE
Typical Wellno such animal Some
days it’s rote and tote—-you know
roll call and work duty Nothin’ much
happens Other days

(pause then)
Other days there’s trouble Gangs
get outta control We gotta lockdown
The boys and girls have their little
bitch spats just like in the real
world only they jump some bones and
try to make their mettle on the new
recruits Ugly stuff Sometimes guys
come in and I say to myself “Two words
for you bye-bye” Cause I know they
ain’t getting out the same as they
came in if you know what I mean

CASTING DIRECTOR
You know this scene we just read
Could you do it in your own words

Vince thinks Shrugs What the hell

VINCE
My own words Well I didn’t read
the whole script or nothin’ but
it seems like this Joey
Zambooli thinks he’s got the goods
on the guy I play Frankie—
(consults script)
Grinucci Which makes this Zambooli
the worst kind of creep

CASTING DIRECTOR
Why do you say that

VINCE
Well like for instance where I work
It’s all about power And guys
like Zambooli come at the new guys and
try to intimidate them And if you don’t
get in their face fast they’ll have
you on all fours sucking the cement
(pause then)
Pardon me

CASTING DIRECTOR
So what’s the best way to deal with
these guys

VINCE
Well what I would do is make it very
clear from the beginning that I am
more psycho than they are

Tony’s words
CASTING DIRECTOR
Explain that to me

VINCE
Well Id put my hand on
this Joey Zambooli’s shoulder and sorta
from nowhere I’d go “I think I’m pissed
off with you but I don’t know why Do I
got a reason”

CASTING DIRECTOR
Look right into the camera as if you
were talking to Zambooli

Vince does as he’s told WE SEE THROUGH THE CAMCORDER LENS
VINCE GIVING THE FOLLOWING PERFORMANCE

VINCE
Yeah Id say “Hey Joey Zambooli
you think I got a reason to be pissed
off with you Gimme your top ten reasons
you’re a piece of shit and I’1ll1 let you
know when somethin’ rings a bell Just
don’t lie to me and don’t figure me for
one of your sissy-boys who’re gonna put
out for you I got the eyes in the
front the back and the side of my head
and they all see twenty-twenty
Comprende you sadly deformed excuse for
humanity posing as a piece of prison
garbage You mess with Tony Nard——
(pause—he corrects himself)
--no You mess with Frankie Grinucci

He stops a little startled by what just came out of him

CASTING DIRECTOR
Okay Thank you

VINCE

glutton for every kind of product they
sell then they open huge supermarkets
filled with food and tell you your not
supposed to eat too much Hello America

125 INT GARAGE DAYLIGHT

Tony sits glowering

Suddenly Tony stands up and BANGS his head against the wall
once twice three times

Scary He pauses Self-loathing and fury in his eyes
Then he notices
HIS BELONGINGS IN THE CORNER

A couple of pairs of pants and socks Plus his duffle
bag

In his eyes impending freedom He throws the bag together
and finds a piece of wire from a hanger on the floor He
bends it and conceals it under his shirt Checks his
appearance in the reflection of the window and then on his
way out notices

A PACK OF MATCHES ON THE FLOOR

He picks them up The matches from Hells Half Acre
that Vivian tossed away the previous day

Tony’s face staring at the caricature of the curvaceous
woman on the cover Looks on the back of the matches Lo and
behold

AN ADDRESS “Hells Half Acre 2100 Route 6 Piscataway New
Jersey”

126 EXT DRIVEWAY DAYLIGHT

Tony looks upstairs at a light in the window He can
see the glow of a television and a silhouette of Joyce

He makes his way stealthily down the driveway keeping
his eyes on the window

127 EXT CITY ISLAND DAYLIGHT
The Rambler drives down the main street of the village
128 EXT RIZZO DRIVEWAY DAYLIGHT

Tony opens the door to the jeep Quickly and expertly
attaches the wire to the ignition head Pigs it to another
wire A moment later the engine starts

He shuts the door quickly backing out of the driveway and
jamming forward down the little street

Tony has boosted the Rizzo’s car
129 EXT CITY ISLAND DOCKS DAYLIGHT

Magic Hour—a glorious summertime 7PM where the sun hangs in
the air slowly sinking Molly and Vince stand at Island’s
edge

MOLLY
Every busy city needs an island of
peace And every busy soul needs a place
of repose

(pause then)
Tell it to me again Your big secret

VINCE
About Tony Well you know the whole
thing You’re the only one who does

MOLLY
But how did it work How did you meet
his mom And when did you know you
were leaving

Beat Vince looks into her and can see that she has a reason
for wanting these specifics Deep breath Here it goes

VINCE
Well when I was ‘bout nineteen I met
Nan who was older And she was hot for
me and I was hot to get away from my
family We drank at the same bar And
before you know itwe were living at her
place in Jersey

(pause then)
Strange how things happen when you’re
not even looking

130 INT JEEP DRIVING DAYLIGHT

Tony drives Reggae dance hall BLARING from the radio He
grooves along with the radio cruises in and out of traffic
and generally seems to be having a great time Freedom

131 INT RIZZO BATHROOM

Joyce is brushing her teeth But she’s out of toothpaste
She opens a closet door and finds

VINCE’S BOOK

“An Actor Prepares” She stares at it suspiciously Opens
it Inside is a card on which is written MOLLY
CHARLESWORTH-917-463-3742 Joyce stares at the number
having at last found the enemy

JOYCE
Bitch

132 EXT CITY ISLAND DOCKS DAYLIGHT

Vince and Molly
VINCE (finishing his tale)
And then the next things she’s pregnant
and by then I knew she was bad news for
me and I tried to get her to get rid of

the kid
(remembering the moment)
And she said to me “I know you’1l

be leaving soon anyway And I ain’t get-
ting left with nothing for myself” And
that’s how I knew she was having the kid
and I had to justdo what I had to do
(pause then)

I had seventy-five hundred bucks saved
from when I started working with my dad
on his boat It was gonna put me through
City College I sent it to her instead
Then I got hooked up with the prison

stuff—figured I needed a good steady
income and pension I never heard from
Nan again

MOLLY
And did you ever tell anyone else
in your family

VINCE
Nah I didn’t wanna burden nobody else
Besides I wasn’t too proud of taking
off

MOLLY
Leaving’s never pretty No matter
how you do it

A beat Then Molly’s cell phone rings She answers it

MOLLY
HelloHello

But there’s nobody there
133 INT RIZZO BEDROOM

Joyce hangs up the phone pain and anger in her eyes
She mimics Molly’s accent

JOYCE
Hulew Hulew Bitch

134 EXT CITY ISLAND DOCKS DAYLIGHT

Molly and Vince She hangs up the cell An odd look in her
eye
MOLLY
There was nobody there

VINCE
I hate these things—I’m always getting’
wrong numbers

MOLLY
No it wasn’t a wrong number it was
an announcement A ring—a bell an
indication

VINCE
Of what

MOLLY (smiles)
Now Vincent Now’s the time You do
have it on you don’t you

Vince’s face blank for a moment Then he realizes she
means the envelope The secret He pulls it out

VINCE
Your secret Yeah course
(before he opens it)
You sure

She nods Doesn’t take her eyes off him He opens it Inside
is a single photograph

THE PHOTO

is of three very young children all grouped on a couch
smiling at the camera

VINCE
Who are they

MOLLY (beat then)
My three secrets

Vince takes this in—trying to connect the Molly he knows
with the Molly that is being revealed She looks him in the
eye Her looks says it all He takes it in Then quietly—

VINCE
Where are they

MOLLY
With my husband in Schenectady

VINCE
Schenectady Upstate What were you
doin’ up there

MOLLY
The real question is what am I doing
down here

(and then)
That’s where I’m from Vincent Born and
raised

VINCE
Your family own some big business up
there or somethin’

MOLLY
My father was the janitor at the grade
school My mother left when I was six
(the photo)
And their mother left a year ago

Big beat Vince connecting the enchantress he knows with
the woman she’s revealing herself to be

VINCE (pause then)
Why

MOLLY
To see if it was possible to pretend
the past never existed

(and finally)
Don’t hate me Vincent I thought if
anyone might understand it would be
you

Vince looks at the picture Then at her In his eyes
sadness—as much at himself as at her He extends his
hand She takes it

135 EXT ROUTE 6 NEW JERSEY DAYLIGHT

The Jeep swerves in and out of traffic at double the
speed of the other drivers It takes a sharp right and
heads off the road

The Jeep pulls in Plenty of other rowdy cars in the parking
lot Tony parks and gets out Feels fucking great

Bruno nods pours a cold one Tony puts down a twenty
Turns and looks at the stage longingly
Three strippers pole dancing Hot stuff Tony stares
trying to drink in a good long look Then—
TONY’S FACE

--something funny here He moves back into the main room
staring at one of the strippers Yes it’s--

VIVIAN

Wrapping her legs around the pole

TONY’S FACE

He can’t put it together He moves closer to the stage
VIVIAN

Wrapping legs shaking booty Customers pant She opens her
eyes And—bingo SEES TONY

TONY’S FACE

Not wanting to be seen but frozen in place
VIVIANS FACE

Not wanting to be seen but frozen in place

They each stare bug eyed at each other Then she jumps off
the stage and races off

Tony goes out the front way
EXT REAR DOOR OF HELL’S HALF ACRE

Vivian emerges in a bathrobe and slippers Slams the
door behind her grasps the wall and closes her eyes

VIVIAN
Shit

138 EXT FRONT DOOR OF HELL’S HALF ACRE DAYLIGHT
Tony emerges looks confused

TONY
Shit

The bouncer stares at him
THE REAR OF THE BUILDING

where Vivian is trying to calm down She furtively looks
over her shoulder out toward--

THE PARKING LOT
where she stares ahead at—
JOYCE’S JEEP

Vivians eyes filled with suspicion She walks to the car
Opens the door and then the glove compartment

The handcuffs fall out So does a cell phone
TONY

watches Vivian discover the jeep Fear in his eyes He
briefly looks like he might flee But this is not an
option After squirming a little he heads toward her

TONY
Uh Hi

VIVIAN (furious)
What are you doing here

TONY
Yeah well guess I could ask
the same question

VIVIAN
Does my mother know you have her car

TONY
Does she know you’re a stripper

Beat
VIVIAN
Give me the key
(pause then)
Do you even have it
(pause then)
You don’t have it
(a smile now)
You stole my mother’s car Didn’t you
Oh you loser

Tony’s eyes real fear She takes the cell phone and
dials 911

TONY
I really think before you do anything
we should talk

VIVIAN
About what Economic theory
(into cell)
Hello I’d like to report a stolen
car Yeah I can hold
(and then)
J-A-I-L here he comes

TONY
I thought you went to college

VIVIAN
Who says I don’t go to college

TONY
What’s this your part-time gig

VIVIAN
I don’t have to tell you anything

TONY
So you do go to college

VIVIAN
I do I mean—yesI do butshit

TONY (the matchbook)
Cause I found this in the garage

VIVIAN
Shit Well so what My parents
aren’t gonna listen to anything you
have to say once they find out you
stole their car

(into phone)
Hi yes My mother’s car was stolen
License plate number is

She doesn’t know it She goes to the back of the car
But Tony runs to the back of the car and stands in front
of the plate as Vivian tries to read it

VIVIAN
Hold on

She runs to the front of the car But Tony sprints
there first and once again obscures the license plate

with his body In frustration she turns to run to the back
again but—

SHE TRIPS

falling on her face and sending the cell phone skidding
across the asphalt Tony makes a diving leap for the phone
and grabs it

VIVIAN
GIVE ME THAT

TONY
CALM DOWN

VIVIAN
YOU STOLE MY MOTHERS CAR

TONY
AND YOURE A STRIPPER

VIVIAN
STRIPPING ISN’T AGAINST THE LAW

TONY
DOES THAT MEAN IT’S OKAY FOR ME TO TELL
YOUR PARENTS ‘BOUT WHAT YOU DO

VIVIAN

MY SCHOLARSHIP IT’S JUST SO I CAN
MAKE ENOUGH MONEY TO GO BACK AND NOT
HAVE TO TELL MY PARENTS WHAT HAPPENED

TONY (laughing at this)
AND I’M A LOSER HUH

She hits Tony hard on his face This stops him
TONY STANDS
throwing her to the ground Beat

TONY
Oh the hell with all of you

HE THROWS THE CELL PHONE

across traffic and the highway Vivian looks stunned as Tony
marches to the car He grabs the handcuffs cuffs one end to
himself and the other end to Vivians arm

VIVIAN
What are you doing

TONY
I’m taking your mom’s car back with
you in it-so you know I really
delivered And only you know I
took it and only I know you work
here That’s the deal forever Un-
less one of us blows it

(then)
That’s how it works where I’ve been and
that’s how it’s gonna work with you and
me Got it Vivian

She gets it But she looks at the handcuffs

VIVIAN
Take these off

TONY
Sorry But your behavior towards me
in the past few days hasn’t exactly
earned my trust

Vivians hostile glare at Tony is mixed with something else
the guilty knowledge that he’s right

139 INT JEEP DRIVING DAYLIGHT
Tony drives with his un-handcuffed hand Hostile silence

VIVIAN
Why did my father bring you home

TONY
I have no idea
Hostile silence Then—

VIVIAN
What was goin’ on with you and my mom

TONY
Nothing

VIVIAN
Are you gonna tell them that I’m a—

TONY
I gave you my word didn’t I My word
is my word Which is something you and
your jerkoff family probably never
heard of Bunch of lyin’ psychos

Tony is finished He stares ahead at the road Vivian
doesn’t react overtly

But in the mirror we see that her eyes are welling up
140 EXT RIZZO HOUSE NIGHT

The Rambler pulls up Vince and Molly get out Molly looks
at the little clapboard house and smiles

But Vince notices the empty parking space the lack of Jeep

VINCE
What the hell

MOLLY
What’s wrong

VINCE
She ain’t home Maybe she went out for
some food

They mount the stairs and enter the house
141 INT HOUSE

Vince and Molly in the living room Vince unpacks his
pockets of keys change Molly sits on the couch

VINCE
Now I’m thinkin’ when she comes
in I’m gonna say Joyce it’s
time we had a talk”

142 RIZZO BEDROOM

Joyce is lying in bed She hears Vince’s voice gets up from
the bed and heads for the

143 UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Where she sees Vince and Molly from the top of the stairs
She looks puzzled They cannot see her

MOLLY
Vincent darling it’s the wrong way
Women—they feel challenged by too much
honesty too quickly

Joyce’s face what the hell

VINCE
Trust me twenty-years I’ve been
with her I know what I’m talkin’
about—

MOLLY
Vincent darling thirty years I’ve
been a woman Let me handle her We
begin casually No mention at all
of anything unusual going on Before she
can even think to ask what I’m doing
here she’1l be thanking me for having
come into your life

Joyce’s face enough is enough Slowly she walks down the
stairs Molly sees her first Looks puzzled Motions to
Vince who turns

VINCE
Hey you’re home

Joyce nods face blank with shock and outrage
JOYCE
Yeah Vince I’m home Where I live
(looks at Molly)
Whos this

Molly stands and extends an arm

MOLLY
Molly Charlesworth A pleasure

Joyce doesn’t take her hand Uncomfortable pause Molly
withdraws it and looks at Vince

VINCE
Molly herewell we got somethin’
to tell you

(flustered—to Molly)
Go ahead

JOYCE
I got something to tell you Vince

VINCE (eyes narrow)
Oh yeah Well what we got to tell is
really very important here

JOYCE
Oh really Well what I got to tell
is pretty important too

VINCE
Wellis it more important or less
important than what we gotta tell

JOYCE
How would I know that Vince I don’t
know what you have to tell me

Beat She has led him successfully down the path of total
incomprehension
MOLLY (helpfully)
May I say--

JOYCE
Don’t say a word bitch

Gasp Molly looks astounded Vince looks astounded Joyce
is calm with righteousness But the pot has begun to boil

VINCE
Joyce What the—

JOYCE
Prick Into my house you bring her huh
Into my own house where I raised your
two children you bring this thing of
yours Well lemme tell you Vince I’m
gonna do you a big favor I’m gonna put
both of you outta your misery here
I’m not gonna be insulted in my own
house I want you gone Vince Out of my
life No more running around behind my
back No more cheap dirty lies No more
lying in bed wondering who else has been
touching my husband No more lying
to myself that it doesn’t matter
I found passion today Vince and

it felt great I was touched and

kissed and held and it felt like

you haven’t made me feel in years
Molly and Vince are watching the monologue mouths agape
Long beat

VINCE
What are you talkin’ here

JOYCE
I’m talking about Tony

Big beat
VINCE
You did somethin’with Tony

JOYCE
More than “something” Vince

Vince’s eyes thunderstruck He suddenly rushes off into
the kitchen The sound of him wretching over the sink

Joyce looks perplexed Molly doesn’t She knows what’s
wrong

MOLLY
Oh dear Greek in scope

Just then—
JOYCE SEES THE JEEP THROUGH THE WINDOW

JOYCE
That’s my car

Joyce watches as Tony and Vivian mount the stairs still
hand-cuffed to each other

VINCE

stumbles back into the room dabbing his face with a wet
cloth What he sees is

TONY AND VIVIAN HANDCUFFED TOGETHER
And she’s in a robe
VINCES FACE

Veins are popping The thought that Tony has had both his

wife and daughter is too much He grabs a BUTCHER KNIFE AND

CHARGES TONY

VINCE
AGGGGGHHHHHH

Everyone screams Vince lunges for Tony Tony jumps out of
the way dragging Vivian with him

Vince lands on the floor in front of the door Joyce
grabs the handcuffs trying to keep them from running

JOYCE
Vince—get the key

Vince gets up fumbles in his pockets and pulls out his
keys Hands them to Joyce and wields the knife at Tony who
looks terrified Joyce unlocks Vivian who runs across the
room Tony shoves Vince away and dashes for the back door
handcuffs dangling from his wrist
144 EXT RIZZO BACKYARD NIGHT

VIVIAN
He didn’t screw nobody

Joyce stymied by the goings-ons can’t answer
VINCE AND TONY

Vince is wielding the knife trying to trap Tony who’s
dodging and feinting for his life

TONY
Put it down man put it down
You’re making a huge mistake

VINCE
AGGGGGHHHH

HE HURLS THE BUTCHER KNIFE

It sails over the fence cleaning missing Tony and
disappearing from sight

VINCE JR
Jeez Dad Pretty lame

TONY
There No more knives okay
(he approaches Vince)
Peace Okay I don’t know what
you think happened here—but
peace Okay Vince Then we’1l
talk

He’s holding his hands out like a suspect apprehended
The handcuffs dangle from his wrist

VINCE (pause then)
Okay peace

Vince holds up his hands in mimicry of Tony Then—
VINCE GRABS THE HANDCUFF
And yanks Tony to the ground

JOYCE
Leave him alone Vince
Tony howls in pain as Vince in expert prison guard mode
subdues him twists his wrist and drags him across the
cement yard He attaches the other end of the handcuff to
the wooden deck

Then he runs to the garage grabs the other pair of
handcuffs and chains Tony’s leg

Tony is now chained on all fours like a wild animal
Vince whacks him across the face

JOYCE
Stop it

VINCE (whacks him again)
Bastard

TONY
Leave me alone

As Vince winds up to whack him again—
JOYCE

Is moved to action She jumps off the back porch and
throws her tiny frame onto Vince’s back Pounds him
with her fists
JOYCE
Stop it Vince He didn’t do nothing

Vince spins around trying to get Joyce off his
back but she stays attached

VINCE
What about your Goddam passion and all
that crap

The two of the them are now arguing while she rides
piggy back on him
JOYCE
So what about yours Vince Your
Molly Ringwald over there who’s
gonna take care of everything
for you and who I’m supposed
to thank for “being in your
life” You bring your filthy
girlfriend into my house—

VINCE
She’s not my girlfriend

Joyce looks up at Molly who appalled shakes her head

MOLLY
I’m his manager

JOYCE

VINCE

JOYCE
What De Niro movie

VINCE
That’s what I was trying to tell
you I’m gonna be in a Robert
De Niro movie directed by Martin
Scorsese

Beat All look at each other puzzled

JOYCE
What kind of bullshit is that

MOLLY
Actually he hasn’t been signed
yet But he auditioned today
and apparently made quite an
impression They’ve called him back

JOYCE
You auditioned for a movie today

VINCE
Yeah and Molly here—wellshe sorta
(pause sigh what the hell)
she’s a friend of mine We’re in
acting class together She told me
to go this audition here so I went

JOYCE
Acting class When do you go
to acting class

VINCE
WHEN I PLAY POKER

Pause Nobody can figure this out

MOLLY
It’s a ruse you see He didn’t
want you to know because Vincent
has feelings of shame and inferi-
ority about his ambitions

JOYCE
Is this just a lot of crap

VINCE
No it’s the truth And I wanted to
tell you about it but I knew
youd be mad about lying to you
about the class so Molly here said
she’d come along andpretend to
be my manager

Joyce dismounts Vince Stares at him He stares back
at her So much frustration jealousy and sheer anger

JOYCE
I don’t believe you

VINCE
You know what honey I don’t give a
shit In fact I don’t give two shits
You don’t believe me Fine with me You

She shakes her head nervously

VIVIAN

Joyce and Vince staring at their daughter Tony looks as
well He and Vivian lock eyes It’s clear she won’t give

TONY

boosted your Goddam car so I could
take off and get away from all your

JOYCE
You stole the car

VINCE
What’s that got to do with her

Tony stares at Vivian who looks back at him Beat She
realizes it’s her turn now

Tension Vince is preparing to whack Tony again Vivian
must come clean or he will be hurt As Tony stars at her—

JOYCE
She is not

VINCE

winds up to whack him again—

VIVIAN

Vivian tries to make her chest look smaller Stares
back defiantly

VIVIAN

Long pause The family stares at each other

JOYCE
They kicked you outta school and took
away your scholarship over an ounce
Jeez When I was at Oneonta I couldn’t
get back into my dorm after a weekend
unless I was carrying an ounce

Vivian and her mother lock eyes She sees at once that her
mother would have been her best friend if she’d let her
Tears well up

Oh mom I’m such a screw-up

mutually shocked at what’s now out in the open

Molly is wide eyed

Joyce tries to take this in

Vivian stands frozen staring at Tony
Tony is hyperventilating on all fours
So is Vince standing over him

Said like close call Vince turns and stares at her
His eyes are pleading for an answer that won’t kill
him
VINCE
Honeywhat happened here

JOYCE
Nothing Sweetie

(and then looking at Tony)
Your son was a perfect gentleman

Tony’s eyes meet Joyce’s they know what they each shared
and why their day together was ultimately a success

DEEPLY Vince remembers
VINCE
Youre the air that I breathe

Vince turns and stares at his son Tony stares up at his
father

Long beat Tony stares at his father A tear glistens
in his eye

Vince unlocks Tony Tony stands A long look between the
two-wordless but filled with apology and a never-ending

sense of how weird life can be

And then Tony and Vince hug each other Vince grabs Joyce
And even Tony and Vivian grab each other

VIVIAN (amazed)
You’re my brother No wonder II
(searching then)
«Il hate you so much
At that moment—

VINCE JR (pleased)
You were right mom Dad did

have sex with Tony’s mom

Joyce looks at her son Long beat Then—she starts to laugh
The more she tries to stop laughing the more she cries

Vince watches this His tears start to mix with his
laughter

That odd mixture again He cries and laughs onto Joyce’s
shoulder

Now the whole family is laughing and crying together
as the sun sets over the Bronx

Hm Well class you now have one less
actor in New York City to worry about
stealing your role

People applaud sarcastically But not Vince

MALAKOV (cont )
Vince You ready

Vince stands and walks to the stage

He looks out at the faces in the audience Seems calm and
sure of himself And after taking a pause he begins

VINCE
You asked me my worst secret My most
personal secret The secret of all my
secrets I get it

(pause then)
But firstI’m Vince Rizzo and I want to begin
by telling you about where I live

Now we realize that the opening monologue was in fact a
flashback from this point Joyce Rizzo stands at the back of
the class Looking at her husband with a different set of
eyes

151 EXT STREET CORNER DAY

Vince exits a deli with three friends They all bid each
other a casual farewell As Vince walks away—

THE SOUND OF A GUN GOING OFF

Vince looking scared Bullets are in the air And THREE
BULLETS STRIKE VINCE

He collapses on the sidewalk blood pouring from his
stomach the look of unexpected death filling his eyes

A very long pause During which we in the audience might
well be thinking what the hell just happened to this
movie

152 EXT RIZZO BACKYARD DAY

A yard party in progress The whole Rizzo family-Joyce
Vivian Vince Jr and Tony EVERYONE EXCEPT VINCE

Joyce raises a glass of red wine in a solemn toast

JOYCE
To my husband

153 EXT STREET CORNER DAY

Vince still lying on the street “dead” blood pouring from
him Finally he hears—

SCORSESE’S VOICE
Cut Great Thanks everyone

Vince opens an eye He’s helped up by some of the crew His
moment on screen—getting murdered by Martin Scorcese—is
over

Costume and props and assistants help him up clean him
congratulate him He looks proud Vince is now a working
actor

154 EXT RIZZO BACKYARD DAY

Joyce continuing her toast A smile now appearing on her
lips
JOYCE
To my husband The best actor in City Island

Now we see Vince standing at the barbeque He smiles at
Joyce Then Tony steps up with his toast

TONY
To my father The only actor in
City Island

He smiles at the man who is his dad And his dad smiles back
at his boy

VINCE (V0O)
Somehow with Tony’s appearance a lot of
good things happened I shoulda looked for
him years ago

Everyone seated at the picnic table Behind them the
view of the water New York City in the distance clear
as a friggin’ bell

VINCE (VO)
Every busy city needs an island of peace
Just as every busy soul needs a place of
repose Before City Island was the place
where I hid from my own life

(and then)
Now it’s home For everyone What else you
need

The food is on the plates Grace time Everyone bows their
heads
VINCE
Yeah We thank you for this meal here
And to show our faith and unity
a moment of silence

As Vince says Grace we see their faces Vince Joyce
Vivian Vince Jr Tony

Vince and Joyce look at each other This is their bond
This is their life

VINCE
All right Let’s eat

The Rizzo family starts passing the food The water in the
background and the forever majestic skyline of Manhattan in
the distance

Ain’t life grand
