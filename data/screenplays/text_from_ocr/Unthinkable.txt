background check After all it would
be so wrong for anyone to suggest that
Islamic terrorists have one thing in
common - theyre all Islamic

H laughs at himself The others look at him with disgust

VANDERBIDEN
This is not funny

SAUNDERS
He’s made no demands no further
contact

FIORINI
Where could he get nuclear material

GUNTER
Three years ago he was on a team
checking nuclear facilities in Russia

H
Oh great choice

GUNTER
Since then some material has gone
missing The Russians can’t trace
about fifteen eighteen pounds they
can’t be accurate Around five pounds
on each bomb Three big cities

FIORINI (TO SAUNDERS )
Sir do we have any direct evidence
that he’s for real

SAUNDERS turns to GUNTER who sighs and nods

SAUNDERS
The Iranians paid him twenty million
to get nuclear material out of Russia
and bring it back to them They se set
the whole thing up Then they lo
track of him and the money

LEONARD
How do we know this

GUNTER
They told us One of their Generals
was a little concerned We might think
they were responsible for what Younger
does with the stuff Nice excuse to
bomb the crap out of them

FIORINI
What does he want Why did he do it

CHARLIE
Jesus the question is not “why he did
it”but “where are the fucking bombs”

FIORINI
You think you can answer one without
the other
SAUNDERS

His wife is a liberal type
environmental nut She wanted a
divorce he didn’t He tried to take
their two kids back to his Mother in
Pakistan The court stopped him gave
custody to the wife Maybe that
turned him we don’t know At some
point he became a fundamentalist

FIORINI
He wants to nuke us because we took
his kids

H
You mess with my family I’‘d feel the
same way

VANDERBIDEN
I have copies of his restricted file

VANDERBIDEN hands out files FIORINI grabs hers and scans it

H (TO CHARLIE)
Everything I need in here

CHARLIE
Sure

H
You’1ll inform me of any developments

CHARLIE
Yup

H
Not much point if you dont

GUNTER
We need you to get back to work But
you yen whisper the word nuclear and
you’ be withdrawn immediately
i ederstood

FIORINI looks up from the file angry

FIORINI
You knew all this and you didn’t tell
us We could have cracked this before
it even happened

VANDERBIDEN
Intelligence couldn’t put the pieces
together

FIORINI

But that’s exactly what we do

GUNTER
So how come our people found his home

FIORINI
Maybe because they had the file Sir

SAUNDERS
I sent Agent Vincent down there We
have forensics working on it now You
better take a look

GUNTER (TO H)
You too

FIORINI
Will someone please tell me who this
person is

GUNTER
Just do your job Fiorini

FIORINI looks at H H smiles back
INT BALTIMORE HOUSE - LATER

FIORINI H and CHARLIE go through the house with VINCENT Plain
lifeless bare Family photos parents a blonde wife with two
kids military buddies in fatigues An American flag on the wall
ERT technicians in plastic suits are still working H seems bored

VINCENT
They peeled this place apart This guy
is so clean he’s weird

FIORINI
Nothing out of place Everything as it
should be The female cousin Aliah
Mustafa No trace of her

VINCENT
No other prints no fibers no hair
Just him

FIORINI

That’s impossible

CHARLIE
Someone cleaned it real good

CHARLIE and H move on FIORINI speaks quietly to VINCENT
FIORINI

Did Military Intelligence go through
this place before we did

VINCENT
I think we can assume that

FIORINI
What the fuck is going on And you
why the hell didn’t you tell me you’d
been sent here

VINCENT
They told me not to

FIORINI shakes her head in disbelief

FIORINI
Are they trying to replace me with
someone else - like you

VINCENT
Nobody else could lead this
investigation we don’t have time to
mess around and you have all the
inside tracks Yes they asked me
and that’s what I told them

FIORINI
Thanks Sorry

VINCENT
It’s not personal Fliss I just hope
I did the right thing

VINCENT looks at her She avoids his gaze and goes into the next
room She sees H leaning against the wall arms folded

FIORINI
So are you some kind of investigator
(BH smiles)
You don’t seem to be interested

Charlie gives me all the information I
need I like to keep my focus clear
on the subject

FIORINI
What subject Who are you people
CHARLIE
The Service
FIORINI

What service What agency

CHARLIE
No agency wants any part of us

H
Were private contractors

CHARLIE
I’m the contractor youre just a sub-
contractor

H
Oh right I’m a sub-contractor

FIORINI
What do you do

CHARLIE
We do stuff No office no oversight
no fuss

FIORINI
There must be legal limits to your
organization

CHARLIE

Yeah I guess there must be
They laugh VINCENT enters

VINCENT
You better see the garage

INT BALTIMORE HOUSE GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

They enter a large garage workshop Machine tools chain hoists
nuke suits engineering rigs

VINCENT
They say the bombs were made here
Traces of radiation three types
including enriched uranium

FIORINI
To what level

VINCENT
Safe enough to walk around that’s all
I know

FIORINI
He made three nuclear bombs in this
garage and all we have is trace levels
of radiation

VINCENT
Maybe he had another place

H
There’s nothing here is there
Charlie can we get to work

INT CONFERENCE ROOM SITCON - LATER

SUTTON leads them into the Conference Room Full of military and
civilians in earnest discussion GENERAL GUNTER is arguing
furiously with SAUNDERS but he stops talking as they approach

GUNTER
You’ve seen the house

H
That’s a scary place You must have
been pleased when you got him
GUNTER turns on him in alarm

H
Why are you wasting my time General

GUNTER
Who told you we have him Who

H
I’m here You called me in So
obviously

GUNTER
Wait here

GUNTER goes leaving SAUNDERS who is clearly seething with anger
CHARLIE laughs FIORINI is confused

FIORINI
Wait what is this were searching
the whole country for this guy

SAUNDERS
These idiots have had him 24 hours
FIORINI
Why didn’t they say How was he
caught
SAUNDERS

A security officer saw him in a mall

FIORINI
His picture is plastered all over the
country and he goes to a mall

H
Sure Macy’s returns department “I’m
sorry this uranium you sold me is
just not enriched enough”

SAUNDERS looks at H in disgust and takes FIORINI aside

SAUNDERS
Listen The Military need us to
investigate get the accomplices find
the bombs but they want to
interrogate the suspect themselves
They’re allowing one agent inside

GUNTER and COLONEL KERKMEJIAN approach

GUNTER
This is Colonel Kerkmejian Military
Intelligence He’1ll take you to him

oo SAUNDERS
Fiorini you report back only to me

FIORINI looks at SAUNDERS GUNTER is incredulous

GUNTER
You’re sending her

SAUNDERS
She’s leading the investi ation she
goes in General you’1l have to let
us interrogate him and you know it

GUNTER
FBI will get access to the prisoner as
soon as he becomes available
GUNTER turns to FIORINI H and CHARLIE
GUNTER
Until then that man is ours You
observe and that is all

KERKMEJIAN
Follow me please

KERKMEJIAN leads FIORINI CHARLIE and H who turns to FIORINI

H
They don’t seem to want you guys
around do they

INT CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HALL SITCON - MOMENTS LATER

KERKMEJIAN leads down a corridor which gets increasingly narrow
and dark There is an MP at the door ahead of them

FIORINI
Who exactly is interrogating this man

KERKMEJIAN
Other Government Agencies have that in
hand
(to H)
I don’t know your work but they tell
me you broke the Chechen case

H
I guess I did

INT THE HALL SITCON - CONTINUOUS

The MP opens the door and they walk into the back of the HALL
This might once have been the base Assembly Room Seats and
tables with a crowd of military and civilians At one end is an
INTERROGATION ROOM with an air-lock door and a wall of glass

FIORINI gasps IN THE ROOM is YOUNGER naked hooded He is spread-
eagled leaning against the wall on his fingers Water is spraying
over his hood and he is gas ing for breath Cold-air fans blow
at him and he shivers uncontrollably

An interrogator ORDEN is dressed in a warm coat and over a

relay we hear his insistent questions KERKMEJIAN speaks quietly

KERKMEJIAN
This is the Interrogation facility
The subject is in there soundproof
one-way glass We have experts from
multiple agencies the military nuke
specialists psychologists analysts
every word and movement he makes

H
Any psychics in here

CHARLIE
Shut up H

H
Why not they got everything else

FIORINI
Who’s in charge here This is illegal

KERKMEJIAN
We never strike him Hot and cold
sleep deprivation intense noise
bright Tights threats of violence

H
Oh he must be terrified Where are
the dogs there should be dogs

FIORINI
Who gave you authorization to

KERKMEJIAN
Everything here is within operational
parameters Agent

CHARLIE
Colonel if you decide to use H he
can’t work with all these people

KERKMEJIAN (SMILING)
You want us to get rid of the others

H
That wont be difficult

H walks to the front of the Hall KERKMEJIAN CHARLIE and FIORINI
follow A stir as some recognize him and others whisper his
name FIORINI sees the disgust on their faces One stands up

LUBITCHICH
You’re not serious Tell me hes not
here

H
Charlie the amateurs are in charge
this won’t work

CHARLIE
You may have to make it work They’re
going to need you on this one

H
Make it work Okay
(He smiles at Fiorini)
Let’s make it work

H looks at the crowd of experts VANDERBIDEN is squashed into a
seat In the front row is ZACHARY Nextto her is LUBITCHICH in
fatigues six foot four of muscle An older QUIET MAN sits to one
side a cane in his hand H turns to look through the glass wall

FIORINI looks too The little details of a naked suffering man
Suddenly H steps forward opens the outer door to the Room and
steps inside He opens the inner door before anyone can stop him

LUBITCHICH
What the hell

CHARLIE
Oh shit

IN THE ROOM ORDEN is surprised by H’s arrival He clearly
recognizes him H glances out towards the Hall From inside the
Room nothing outside can be seen He goes straight to YOUNGER
pulls him upright and rips off his hood YOUNGER blinks in the
ight shivering with cold as the water cascades down his face

H
Hello

ORDEN is furious but covers it H picks up the night stick that
lies on the table and turns to face YOUNGER ORDEN is alarmed

ORDEN
No No way

H swings round and HITS ORDEN IN THE FACE ORDEN flies against
the wall H follows up with a series of vicious strikes Blood
sprays across the Room YOUNGER’S eyes watching amazed

IN THE HALL they are paralyzed for a second

LUBITCHICH
What the fuck

KERKMEJIAN
MPs now

There is a rush for the door of the Room

IN THE ROOM H is pulled outside by two MP’s WINSTON and TRUMAN
LUBITCHICH picks up ORDEN’s unconscious body and carries him out

IN THE HALL H is put face down on a table as the MP’s cuff him

CHARLIE
Don’t hurt him

H
What’s the matter I didn’t strike
the prisoner

H looks at FIORINI gestures to the Room She seizes the moment

FIORINI VANDERBIDEN (TO H)
Colonel the suspect is now Are you out of your mind You
available for interview I’m just assaulted an interrogator
going in
KERKMEJIAN

What No I don’t have authorization

FIORINI
Then get it I’m sure you don’t
intend to obstruct the FBI

She takes out her pistol and places it on a table

KERKMEJIAN
Where the hell is Lubitchich
(pointing toH)
And get him out of here

H flashes FIORINI a smile as the MP’s hustle him away She goes
into the Room as KERKMEJ LAN picks up a phone

IN THE ROOM YOUNGER remains leaning against the wall chained in
a stress position He is naked wet and shivering He looks at
FIORINI in her sharp FBI suit

FIORINI
Mister Younger I am Agent Fiorini
FBI As soon as I can I’m getting you
out of this so we can sit down and
talk You’ve been badly treated and
I’m sorry

YOUNGER replies with a strange calmness

YOUNGER
Thank you for your concern It’s not
pleasant but it’s okay

FIORINI
It’s not okay You have grounds for
legal complaint and if you want me
to I‘ll help you make it

YOUNGER
I think you’1ll find that this is
entirely legal And necessary

FIORINI
Necessary

YOUNGER
In the war against terror

FIORINI is taken aback She turns off the cold fan gets a towel
and dries his back

IN THE HALL the observers watch KERKMEJIAN is on the phone

ZACHARY
What the hell is that woman doing

KERKMEJIAN
Yes Sir she’s in there now

IN THE ROOM YOUNGER still shivers as FIORINI dries him

YOUNGER
Thank you Could you please dry my
arms they’re really col

FIORINI does so As she reaches up he looks quickly at her watch
She notices She smiles at him almost teasing

FIORINI
You looked at my watch Go on yes you

YOUNGER

my wife and kids yet

FIORINI
You must be worried about them

YOUNGER

YOUNGER

FIORINI
Alright Yusuf What is it you want

The door swings open GUNTER is there with LUBITCHICH And
KERKMEJIAN who looks very uncomfortable

YOUNGER
Sorry too soon to tell you

LUBITCHICH instantly hoods YOUNGER and places earphones on him
with very loud music YOUNGER grunts slightly as his eardrums are
pounded GUNTER turns on FIORINI in fury

GUNTER
You Get the fuck out of here
(to LUBITCHICH)
And you get some fucking results

INT FBI ROOM SITCON - LATER THAT NIGHT

In the new FBI room the board of suspects now has even more
pictures most of them circled in red There is a crowd of agents
all from the Baltimore office including VINCENT BAINES addresses
them in the background while SAUNDERS and FIORINI talk quietly

FIORINI BAINES

people What they are doing is know what we’re up against
ineffective and illegal And Youshould know that FBI is

it but that’s the way it is files of every other agency

SAUNDERS SENIOR AGENT
The Government has a tool-box Thatll be a first Is this

FBI is just a wrench They got CIA
hammers too

BAINES
It would be illegal for CIA to operate
inside the United States Fiorini

FIORINI addresses the room

FIORINI

We have five days You got to stay
fresh We’re setting up cots in the
back there make sure you rest when
you can Your instructions are that
you do not reveal to anyone outside
this room that we have a suspect
Officially he doesn’t exist

VINCENT
Why cant we interrogate this guy

SAUNDERS
We are currently negotiating that

VINCENT
“Negotiating”

FIORINI
I had the chance to interview him
briefly As yet he’s made no demands
but he clearly has a timetable We
assume he has outside accomplices It
is vital we find his family members
You pull in every contact you make
ever ossible connection But the
absolute priority of you and your

(MORE)

FIORINI (contd)

FIORINI

The other agents are aghast But BAINES takes it

BAINES

BAINES leaves The agents look at him and her

VINCENT
You ain’t gonna last long that way

SAUNDERS
Fiorini

SAUNDERS is on the phone which he puts down as she goes to him

FIORINI

SAUNDERS
There have been developments There’s
something you may have to do

INT MILITARY CELL CORRIDOR SITCON - DAWN MONDAY

FIORINI walks down a corridor She is accompanied by a SOLDIER
who carries a meal on a tray Loud heavy metal music is playing
The SOLDIER opens a door and FIORINI enters another corridor
There are closed cells with steel doors on each side and the
music is deafening here The SOLDIER marches to the next door
while FIORINI hangs back appalled At each end of the corridor
are GUARDS with heavy ear-defenders The SOLDIER holds the next
door open for her The GUARDS stare at her as she walks through

INT CELL SITCON - LATER

They enter a large room with a number of cells cages of open
steel bars In one of them H sits on a bed reading a file The
SOLDIER pushes some breakfast through the bars to him and leaves
They can hear the heavy metal music through the walls

H
Morning You like Metallica It’s
just the funniest thing “No not
Metallica I’1l tell you anything”

H chuckles He picks at his food and reads the file

FIORINI
So I understand you’re a specialist
interrogator Is that how you work

H
We needed to lose the ‘B’ team

FIORINI
Are they going to use you after that
little show

H
You think that was a show

FIORINI
And it wasn’t just for me to let me
in It was for Younger You wanted
him to see it

(no response from H)
If they do allow you to question him
youll need me to work with you

H (LAUGHING)

Is that what they told you to say So

anything more about him

FIORINI
A little Have you

FIORINI gestures at the file in H’s hand

H
Oh this isn’t his file It’s yours
He shows her the photograph in her own file FIORINI grabs for it

FIORINI
I don’t believe it Give that to me

H

INT CORRIDOR TO THE BASEMENT - LATER

FIORINI follows H CHARLIE and KERKMEJIAN down concrete steps and

along a basement corridor The other observers follow behind the

QUIET MAN hobbling down the steps The corridor is dirty and dimly
lit and at the end is a heavy steel door

INT THE BASEMENT SITCON - CONTINUOUS

They enter a large BASEMENT with some basic furniture covered in
dust sheets At one end a wall has been built with lumber and
sound-proofed boards to create a CELL with a heavy door

H
Is my equipment ready

CHARLIE
In boxes This is Alvarez

ALVAREZ stands quietly to one side a stocky short man with a
face that says nothing H nods at him

FIORINI
Where’s Younger

KERKMEJIAN
In there

He points towards the connecting door FIORINI moves towards it

KERKMEJIAN
You don’t go in

The MP’s look at each other WINSTON goes for the ax TRUMAN
helps KERKMEJIAN remove the dust sheets revealing furniture and a
large video monitor ghey check connections on it H puts on a
white lab coat FIORINI looks around her with growing suspicion

FIORINI
What the hell is this This is going

H
The current war on terrorism is not a
conflict envisioned by the framers of
the Geneva Conventions

FIORINI
Bullshit
H
I am quoting the former Secretary of
Defense
FIORINI
If this comes anywhere near torture
H
I’m not going to address the “torture”
word
FIORINI
Listen you asshole
‘ H
I’m still quoting the Secretary of

hand YOUNGER winces H reaches for the fire—ax

IN THE BASEMENT they watch KERKMEJIAN gives a nervous laugh

KERKMEJIAN
Waithe’s not

IN THE CELL H lifts the fire-ax and brings the hammer-head down
hard YOUNGER lets out a yell of shock and agony H flips the ax
over in mid-air Now he brings the ax-head down Another hideous
shriek of pain With a little click of his tongue H uses the fire-
ax like a putter to tap something down the table It is the
crushed top joint of YOUNGER’S little finger

IN THE BASEMENT amazement then panic

FIORINI
No

VANDERBIDEN

KERKMEJIAN looks at her Then decides

KERKMEJIAN
They stay right outside the door

H
It’s a deal

KERKMEJIAN nods and the MP’s leave H returns to the Cell

FIORINI
I don’t believe this that man should
be pulled out right now

ZACHARY
No honey you should You want to go
that’s fin

IN THE CELL YOUNGER writhes in agony as he tries to breathe
against the tape H takes a scalpel and puts a small hole in the
tape between YOUNGER’S lips Desperately he sucks in a tiny
stream of air It just prolongs the agony H turns to ALVAREZ

H
Undo this box and lay out the
contents on the table please

ALVAREZ obeys H adjusts pHgats tilts the chair checks the array
of swabs instruments dril and gadgets that look like garden
tools YOUNGER writhes more approaching unconsciousness

H
You worked for me before Remember the
Chechen girl You cleaned up for me

ALVAREZ
That was someone else

H
Sure it was You can leave now

ALVAREZ goes H rips the tape from YOUNGER’S mouth and he gulps
for air H picks up a blade and leans into his face

Are you ready for this No No-one
ever is 1 out nightmares your
worst fears ey’re all here

A moment of silence as H lowers the blade We do not see where
YOUNGER looks into his eyes This can’t be happening The cut
that H makes is so smooth so slow that he gasps before
experiencing unimaginable pain Then comes the scream

IN THE BASEMENT KERKMEJIAN VANDERBIDEN and FIORINI can’t believe
what they are seeing CHARLIE and ZACHARY just watch

FIORINI
Oh my God

KERKMEJIAN
Get General Gunter here right now

VANDERBIDEN picks up a phone The screams go on

FIORINI
This is beyond any legal limits

CHARLIE
What limits do you think that bastard
has

FIORINI
Colonel I know the law military and
civilian We signed the United Nations
Convention against torture the Geneva
Conventions

ZACHARY
The law is the Military Commissions
Act which says that no unlawful enemy
combatants may invoke the Geneva
Conventions

The screams go on FIORINI has to shout

FIORINI
That act declares torture illegal

ZACHARY
Sure it does but unlawful combatants
have no right to Habeas Corpus which
means they can’t bring any claim to
court so how do they prove it

FIORINI
No the MCA refers to alien unlawful
enemy combatants He is an American
Citizen

ZACHARY
He was granted citizenship That was
revoked yesterday He’s an alien

FIORINI
You can’t DO that

CHARLIE (MIMICS)
“You cant DO that”

A voice makes her turn

QUIET MAN
For Chris’sake there are three
nuclear bombs You know what that

could do to our country
VANDERBIDEN puts down the phone

VANDERBIDEN
General Gunter says he cant come
right now youre in charge here so
carry on

KERKMEJIAN
He says WHAT

Suddenly H comes out of the Cell He nods to ALVAREZ who goes
back in The screams have become whimpers

H
Do we have coffee here We need to
arrange that

KERKMEJIAN
We could do this our way Our methods
work

H
I agree CIA techniques are the best
in the world So why didn’t they work
with him I wonder

H glances at ZACHARY
VANDERBIDEN
You didn’t even question him
H
You mean this blood on my coat would
be alright if I got some information
FIORINI
Youwon’t get any You do this and
he’11 Say anything you want and none
of it will be true

H
You think I don’t know that

FIORINI
Physical torture does not work

H
Then why has it always been used For
fun

FIORINI
You seem to enjoy it

H
I need him to believe I have no
limits

FIORINI
Do you

H
Everyone has limits You better pray
we reach his before we reach mine

FIORINI
This man has broken the law I demand
his arrest If you don’t do it I will

CHARLIE
Come on it’s a little persuasion
FIORINI
There is no such thing as a ‘little’
torture
CHARLIE

You’1l find the US Government
disagrees with you

FIORINI
No The President has specifically
rejected the use of torture

CHARLIE
Listen bitch let’s get this
straight The law is as loose as a
horse full of shit We can do any dam
thing we like

FIORINI is stunned H gestures to the QUIET MAN

H
Let’s ask him You’re the man arent
you There’s always a man Direct
access highest levels back door no
names no records Do I have
authorization or not

They all look at the QUIET MAN

QUIET MAN
Higher authority believesthat we
should all do what we think is best
for our country and its people

H
Good So this is how we will operate
One you will not interrupt me
Two you will notact on anything the
subject says until I confirm it
Three you will remember this I am on
your side

H returns to the Cell FIORINI turns on the QUIET MAN

FIORINI
You allow this to continue you are a
party to his doing it

(She turns to KERKMEJIAN)
Colonel the suspect is in danger if
he dies we lose any chance of finding
the bombs

KERKMEJIAN
We do not fail in this mission Stay
in and shut up or get out and don’t
come back

FIORINI
I am making an official complaint
right now

ZACHARY
Goodbye Agent Fiorini

The screams begin again FIORINI turns to look then leaves
INT FBI ROOM SITCON - LATER

She bursts in and goes straight to SAUNDERS who sits with BAINES
in a small office to one side
FIORINI
Sir we have to stop this

SAUNDERS
Close the door Fiorini you report to
me not to the whole room

She closes the door and gathers herself

FIORINI
We have to stop them they are
torturing

SAUNDERS

SIT DOWN please
She sits BAINES puts a document in front of her
SAUNDERS
What’s happening down there is clearly
illegal Weve prepared your official

She looks at it in disbelief

FIORINI
You mean you know
SAUNDERS

FIORINI

SAUNDERS

FIORINI

SAUNDERS

Then why have you left the room

FIORINI

they’ re hoping youll crack And now
youve walked out

SAUNDERS
It’s happening Agent so use it Let
this bastard soften him up then use
your skills to

FIORINI
Soften him up

SAUNDERS leans in close

SAUNDERS
We have to be very careful We can’t
get in the way of a good result We
were criticized after 9-11 you know
how unfair that was It’s essential
that we stay in the game without
being a part of it

FIORINI
It’s essential we stay true to the
Constitution

For a moment SAUNDERS lets rip

SAUNDERS

If those bombs go off there IS no
fucking Constitution We are that
close to Martial Law

(he calms down instantly)
My apologies When H takes a break
you get in there Now please sign this
protest and returnto your duty

He slides the document towards her She looks at it and at them

INT BASEMENT CORRIDOR SITCON - LATER

FIORINI walks past WINSTON towards the steel door SUTTON is
standing in front of it

SUTTON
Ma’am you no longer have access

FIORINI
No we agreed with General Gunter

SUTTON
I have instructions from inside not to
let you back in Maybe your superiors
should send in a more experienced
Agent

She thinks about hitting him She walks away from the door and
stops trying to work out what to do WINSTON is there a big
hulking MP a Native American with a gentle voice

WINSTON
You really want to go back in there

H comes out of the Basement
SUTTON

H
You didn’t last long

FIORINI follows them and gets beside H They walk fast along
the corridor up the stairs passing TRUMAN who stands on guard
there and along another corridor FIORINI tries to speak calmly

FIORINI
There are other techniques of
interrogation better ones

H
Torture’s not a technique it’s a
vocation

FIORINI

Thats what makes you special is it
Our secret weapon against the enemy

H
Its not about “the enemy” Its
about us Our weakness Were on the
losing side Felicity Were afraid
they’re not We doubt they believe

H stops This corridor has a window with a glass door He looks
through it at THE GARDEN a meadow of overgrown brush and trees

H
That’s nice

He walks on FIORINI and WINSTON following

H
We need an army of people like me
We’re the only ones can match them

FIORINI
We don’t want to We have values
they’re worth something

H
Oh really how much How many lives
are our “values” worth You see that
guy in there is not the problem
You are

black bag H follows her in

ZACHARY
Are you crazy

agency full of atheist liberals but I
think we should let her work

Go ahead make it quick

FIORINI enters THE CELL for the first time and is shocked at what
she sees YOUNGER is naked but the wounds on his body are
carefully dressed He hangs by his wrists from a rope attached to
a pulley in the ceiling His feet cannot touch the ground He is
in pain There are chains hanging from the ceiling hooks in the
walls tables laid out with instruments water tanks with dripping
faucets drains set into the tiled floor

FIORINI
Jesus Christ

YOUNGER looks at her She unties the rope from a cleat on the
wall and lowers YOUNGER in a heap to the floor

YOUNGER
Thank you

FIORINI
Yusuf you’re a brave man But he’s
not ding to stop Why are you

As the continuous screams of unspeakable agony echo around her
FIORINI tries not to retch VANDERBIDEN gets up

VANDERBIDEN
I can’t do this I shouldn’t be here

CHARLIE

VANDERBIDEN hurries out of the door FIORINI confronts ZACHARY

FIORINI
Alright that’s it I demand to be
allowed to question the prisoner If

The voice of H calls over the speaker

H (ON SPEAKER)
Felicity Felicity Would you come

FIORINI is horrified

ZACHARY
Looks like you got your chance

IN THE CELL YOUNGER is strapped to the chair his wrists tied
down H uses a plastic sheet to cover his body and his hands He
sits FIORINI comes in very slowly He beckons her closer

H
Just here

She moves closer then sees a blood-soaked bowl of human
fingernails She retches H puts a cloth over the bowl

H
Oh sorry

FIORINI
What do you want me to do

What are you willing to do Look at
her Yusu Look at Miss America If

H
No not me - him His neck muscles are

She walks slowly around the chair She puts her hands on YOUNGER’S
neck He flinches She starts to massage

H
Mind if I play some music

H turns on his DVD player It is Haydn’s “Surprise” Symphony It
starts softly then later it bursts into life H pops a pill

H
You want one of these keep you going

FIORINI shakes her head He moves close to her drops a couple of
pills in the pocket of her blouse

Take some for later Go as deep as you
can he’s blocking the pain I don
want to lose sensitivity right now

She realizes his reason for doing this and pulls away

H
Don’t stop You’re easing his pain

She starts again H is very close to her

H
Some subjects can take it from a male
but a woman just cracks them up I had
a nurse who used to assist me

precedent I have placed three bombs

the following three public
announcements First that no further
financial support will be given to
puppet regimes and dictatorships in
any Islamic nation Second that the

FIORINI leaves

IN THE BASEMENT she heads for the door as on the monitor YOUNGER
begins an agonizing scream

ZACHARY
You have no authority to make any kind
of deal with that man

INT FBI ROOM SITCON - EVENING OF THE FOURTH DAY

ZACHARY calls after her

and pulls his blanket aside

FIORINI fighting exhaustion paces as she talks with her inner
team A board with a map of the world leans against a chair with

marks and strings of tape all over it

LEONARD

CIA are liaising with foreign

intelligence sources We got him in
Yemen Pakistan Russia all over He
used several passports) he got sloppy

left traces a

FIORINI

1 over the place

Can we put him and the nuclear
material together at any time

LEONARD

Theres a ton of circumstantial The
Russians don’t know exactly

FIORINI
He had fifteen eighteen pounds of it
Thats not easy to transport

LEONARD
He had a lot of money Paid somebody
for something

FIORINI
Sure but for what We need to know
where he spent it Deejay

Another board goes up - a map of the USA with just a few markers

JACKSON
Not so good He came back in through
New York we have him there
Washin ton Chicago And one sighting
in Dallas That was Phil

FIORINI
Phil

PHILLIPS
I figured he’d need a truck I got a
room full of people checking every
rental agency We got lucky with one
of his aliases

FIORINI
Okay keep driving it on Deejay you
push on those bank transfers

The meeting breaks up

FIORINI
That’s good work Phil Don’t let them
rush you Detail you’re good at that

PHILLIPS
But they got so much on their map how
come we got nothing on ours

PHILLIPS goes FIORINI stops She looks at the two maps Then she
looks around her at the room full of urgent chaos VINCENT comes
in holding up a tape

VINCENT
The tape you wanted Younger’s arrest

TIME CUT TO LATER FIORINI watches a grainy tape of YOUNGER
walking into a mall He looks around and then sits on a bench

FIORINI
How long does he sit there

VINCENT
Twenty-three minutes Security told
the cops they came in to get him
She hurries

FIORINI
He walks in he looks around he sits
directly in front of a security
camera and he stays there for twenty-
three minutes My God H is right

over to SAUNDERS and BAINES

FIORINI
Sir have you seen those maps

SAUNDERS
Yes what is it

FIORINI
Everything here is laid out for us
His house is like a stage set with
just enough nuclear residue He has
traceable links with terrorist
contacts He travels the world we can
follow every step But he comes back
home he covers his tracks like a pro

SAUNDERS
So

FIORINI
We have no direct evidence that he
possesses nuclear material

BAINES
Except a video with three bombs on it

FIORINI

And he knows how to make them look
just right doesn’t he He’s a clever
guy So cléver he gets himself caught
the day after he sends in the video

she points to the monitor)
He sits in a mall His picture is
everywhere including on the TV in
that store right behind him

SAUNDERS
Intelligence have no doubt He had the
time the means the capability the
contacts the finance

FIORINI
When intelligence agencies look for
conspiracies they find them We look
for evidence - and we don’t have it

BAINES
What is this

FIORINI
Some guy waves a toy gun in the air
and forces us to shoot him Suicide by
Police What about torture by
government

BAINES
So he got himself captured so we could
torture him He was prepared for that
was he Is that what you’re saying

FIORINI stops cold Thoughts racing through her head
FIORINI
No That’s what he said “I’m
prepared” that’s what he said I need
to get back in there
She hurries out

INT THE BASEMENT SITCON - MOMENTS LATER

IN THE CELL YOUNGER is choking He is on the chair his mouth
stretched open by a metal contraption H is working on his teeth
FIORINI enters and tries hard not to retch

H

H

FIORINI
Get that fucking thing out of his
mouth and LEAVE THIS ROOM

H looks at her Suddenly he unhooks and removes the contraption
from YOUNGER’s mouth

H

H strolls out of the Cell YOUNGER blubbers like a child all
blood tears and snot FIORINI moves behind him She talks
softly close to his ear caressing his hair

FIORINI

address as he whispers it Then she shows it to YOUNGER

FIORINI

YOUNGER
Yes Please don’t let him hurt me

YOUNGER weeps She leaves

IN THE BASEMENT the observers stare at FIORINI as she picks up a

necessary

Now we see that we are at a funeral in a cemetery overlooking the
city Men in dark suits watch from a distance asa coffin is
lowered into the earth There is a only a pitifully small group of
mourners and the funeral staff

RINA stands beside the grave with her two children at her side
All three throw earth into the grave FIORINI comes up beside her
and reaches out with a handful of earth RINA’s hand grabs and
holds her wrist like a vice The funeral staff notice but look
away RINA whispers

RINA

FIORINI
No Rina No I didn’t

RINA
Your friends did You hated him

FIORINI
I tried to understand him

RINA lets her wrist go FIORINI throws in the earth
RINA

Beyond the ring of mourners the QUIET MAN and CHARLIE watch

CHARLIE
