1 EXT DESERT VALLEY - DAY
The high desert -- absolutely silent -- a vast hard land-

scape stretching away to distant mountains The silence is
broken by hoof-beats

2 EXT EDGARS PLACE - DAY

Its a simple cabin dwarfed by a big ramshackle barn EDGAR
DEEMS (60s) a weathered desert rat of a hermit is walking
his donkey around in circles

Now rattling toward them down an endless dirt road comes an
old sun-bleached Buick It stops and out leans OLD FRED
(70s) wearing a sweat-stained fedora The two friends nod

OLD FRED
Hows she doing
EDGAR
She wants to lay down Ima
little worried

Old Fred climbs out with a bushel basket of carrots
OLD FRED

Well I brung her something I know
she likes

EDGAR
Damn Fred you cant give away all
those

OLD FRED

Forget it I got vegetables coming
out my ears Usually the varmints
eat up half my crop but lately I
aint so much as seen a gopher or a
jack-rabbit nowheres

EDGAR
If that aint the truth And I
count on them for a little bit of
stew meatThank you Fred

Edgar takes the carrots and feeds one to the donkey
EDGAR (contd)
Here you go Justine Look what

Fred brought you

OLD FRED
We playing cards tonight

EDGAR
I think Im gonna be sitting up
with her

OLD FRED
Id do the same Well catch you
Thursday

EDGAR
You bet

The men nod and Old Fred drives off

CLOSE-UP of the donkeys hooves thumping along as Edgar leads
her to the barn

EDGAR (contd)
Lets get you out of the sun for a

spell

EDGAR (contd)
Ill get you some fresh water

But suddenly we hear the donkey restlessly stomping its
hooves and braying Edgar turns concerned Now we hear an
odd sound Distant thunder The wind The donkey gets more
and more frantic

The barn shudders violently Frightened birds explode from
the eaves Dust puffs from every old seam Roof shingles
rain down Edgar stares in amazement

EDGAR (contd)
some kind of earthquake

Then another sound -- the donkey starts screeching in wild
panic

EDGAR (contd)
Justine hang on Im coming

Edgar races back to the barn and flings open the doors

INT EDGARS BARN - DAY

Dust swirls through the air But -- the barn in empty No
donkey Now Edgar is hit by a ghastly stench He staggers
back and covers his nose with a handkerchief Then he sees
splattered across the walls -- blood

EDGAR
What in the name of Jehovah

He raises his arms above the door frame When he lowers them
hes holding a 12 gauge shotgun He races outside ready to
shoot but theres nothing -- as far as the eye can see

EXT CLIFFS - DAWN

The sun lights up spectacular sheer cliffs which plunge 1000
feet from a ruggedly beautiful high-desert plateau At the
top of the cliffs silhouetted against the dawn a lone cow-
boy seems to gaze in deep contemplation at the sunrise As
we MOVE IN we realize hes actually peeing over the cliff

This is VALENTINE MCKEE Smart and good looking Val
has nevertheless managed to underachieve brilliantly He
coasts through life following the path of least resistance
-- which has brought him to this dubious rustic existence on
the edge of civilization But lately hes beginning to
wonder why he hasnt accomplished more in his 25 years

As a few sleepy cows gaze at him sleepy Val shuffles over to
his battered old pickup truck A hand-painted sign on the
door reads V and E -- All Types of Jobs Indeed the
pick-up bed is jumbled with tools and supplies for every
conceivable odd job -- and the noisily snoring form of his
partner huddled in a dirty sleeping bag Val raps on the
side of the truck

VAL
(softly)
Good morning Mr Bassett this is
your wake-up call Please move
your fat ass

No response from the sleeping bag Val stares at the cows
chewing their cud -- and perks up as he gets an idea He

gently steps onto the trucks running board then suddenly
starts jumping up and down as hard as he can rocking the

truck violently

VAL (contd)
STAMPEDE EARL GET OUT OF THE
WAY

The sleeping bag tries to get up and run for it It tumbles
out of the back of the pickup While Val laughs uproar-
iously EARL BASSET claws his way out of the bag looks
around wildly and finds himself staring at three motionless
cows

EARL
You dumb shit

Earl is a good-ol boy who has lived his life just like Val
drifting from job to job He knows why he hasnt accom-
plished anything and often tries to impart his hard-won
wisdom to Val but the last thing the younger man wants is
advice

Earl stretches The men begin a silent ritual Earl gropes
through his pockets for a cigarette but only finds a
lighter Meanwhile Val digs in his pockets coming up with
cigarettes but no lighter Typical of these two each guy
always has half of what he needs Eventually they sort it
out trading the necessary implements

Earl reaches for a coffee-pot on a battered Coleman stove on
the tailgate But its cold

EARL
You didnt cook breakfast

VAL
Did it yesterday Franks and
beans

EARL

(tries to recall)
Noit was eggs I did eggs

VAL
Hell you did Your turn

Earl raises his fist This is The Challenge and it instantly
triggers the partners conflict-resolution technique They
solve all disputes using the childrens game of scissors
rock paper Earl raises his fist in response The game is
played swiftly and silently -- one two three On three

Val mimes paper (open hand Earl mimes scissors (two
extended fingers) Scissors cuts paper Val has lost He
shrugs and starts pumping up the stove fuel tank

VAL (contd)
Well when Im your age Ill
probably forget what I eat too

EXT DESERT VALLEY - FENCE - DAY 4A

Val and Earl are restringing a dilapidated and seemingly
endless barbed wire fence A few bored cows watch them

VAL
How many cows does it take to make
a stampede Is it like three or
more Is there a minimum speed

EARL
(shakes his head)
I was in one A bolt of lightning
blew up cottonwood tree Three
hundred head going hell-bent for
the horizon Wasnt so damn funny
I can tell you

Earls hand slips and the fence snags him right through his
thick glove

EARL (contd)
Ow God damn Is this a job for
intelligent men

VAL
If there was one nearby Id
probably ask him

EARL
I keep thinking if we were but
half serious about money we should
quit being hired hands and

VAL
(mock serious)
Handymen Earl Were handymen

EARL
Whatever the hell we are we should
quit and go get ourselves some real
employment

Val gestures to the vastness around them

VAL
What and give up all this personal
freedom
EXT JEEP TRAIL - DAY 5

Val guides the truck down a tortuous rocky almost impas-
sable trail It takes full concentration as he fights the
steering wheel shifts rides the brake and leans out trying
to pick a decent route Earl braces his feet on the dash and
munches breakfast a raw hot dog right out of the package

VAL
Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every
year
EARL
(shrugs)

Has a lot of rain

Earl pulls a box of Hershey bars from under the seat Theres
only one bar left He sets the box down between them Val
glances at it -- and raises his fist The Challenge One
two three Val mimes paper Earl mimes rock Earl
loses Val takes the bar

EARL
(pointing ahead)

Youre gonna get us hung up

VAL
Do not talk to the driver

THWONK The truck lurches to a stop its frame caught on a
big rock Val glares at Earl
EXT DESERT INTERSECTION - PICK-UP TRUCK - DAY 6
The pick-up turns from a dirt road onto an old paved road

VAL (VO)

What do we have next

INT PICK-UP - MOVING - DAY 7
Earl consults a crumpled list pulled from inside his hat

EARL

EARL

the long view Hell here it is
Monday and Im already working on
Wednesday

(squints dubiously at

his schedule)
It is Monday right

But Val is peering at the desert up ahead Off the road a
ways is a small Toyota pick-up truck and beside it a lone
figure trying to flag them down

VAL
Who the hells that Thats not
whats his namethe grad student

EARL
Nah its September Must be the
new one

VAL
The new one Thats supposed to be
a girl

Earl braces himself knowing what Val will do Val swerves
the truck wildly off the road barreling across the desert

VAL (contd)
(almost praying)
You will have long blonde hair big
green eyes nice full breasts that
stand up and say hello ass that
wont quit And legs legs that go
all the way up

Earl shakes his head mildly bemused as they slide to a stop
in a cloud of dust

EXT DESERT - RHONDAS TRUCK - DAY

Val looks out hopefully The dust clears He sees her --
RHONDA LeBECK Vals eyes do an expert vertical scan
short brown hair small brown eyes so-so chest legs hidden

in baggy dungarees

Laden with a portable computer notebooks and some
seismograph printouts she stares at him through tilted
glasses Her little pick-up truck is loaded with geology
field equipment She shakes Vals hand firmly

RHONDA
(brightly)
Hi Im Rhonda Rhonda LeBeck

VAL

VAL

RHONDA

seismographs You know they

RHONDA

vibes every sensor Ive got is

machines up here three years and
theyve never recorded anything
like this

EARL

know if we hear of anything

RHONDA
Thanks God I hope theyre not
screwed up I might have to bag

EARL
No problem Nice meeting you

Rhonda unhappily turns back to her equipment as Val and Earl
drive off

INT PICK-UP TRUCK - MOVING - DAY
Earl glances over at Val with a gleam in his eye

EARL

You know if you wanted we could
take a look at those seismographs
for her

VAL
What the hell do we know about
seismographs

EARL
Nothing But it sure might be a
nice way of getting to know her

VAL

shots of nearly identical blonde bimbos Val points to one

Val rolls his eyes -- Give me a break
EXT PERFECTION - ESTABLISH - DAY

The pick-up rattles toward a tiny utterly isolated high
desert hamlet -- a few dozen houses and mobile homes fighting
for shade in the vast landscape Its most prominent feature
is an aging wood-frame water tower perhaps 25 feet high
near the center of town A sign PANS into view --
PERFECTION -- Pop 14

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Val and Earl head past the water tower for Pham Vans General
Store Perfections main gossip stop and only business The
stores sign in English and Vietnamese reads Groceries
Haircuts Post Office Town Hall VIDEOS Val and Earl park
next to a camouflage-painted large-tired Blazer

Just then they spot MELVIN the towns surly teen-aged pain-
in-the-ass coming toward them mindlessly bouncing a
basketball off the hoods of parked cars As he nears their
truck

EARL
Melvin touch that truck and die

MELVIN
Oh man Im really shaking

But he steers clear of their truck

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY 12
Inside the energetic Vietnamese owner PHAM VAN presides
over his all-purpose establishment part general store part

barber shop part saloon

At the bar are BURT GUMMER and his wife HEATHER two no-
nonsense survivalists who have settled in Perfection to await
the coming apocalypse -- a nice enough couple but theres a

hint of paranoia around the edges Burt is shoving a box of

cartridges across to Pham

BURT
No Pham theyre not hollow
points I ordered hollow points
and thats what I want

When Val and Earl enter Pham automatically pops the tops on
two cold beers and has them in place before the cowboys reach
the bar Everyone exchanged nods

HEATHER
Hi guys what you been up to

VAL
Ran into the new college student
Rona

EARL

Rhonda Rhonda LeBeck Shes

readings on her things

Eminent domain

HEATHER
Down honey down

VAL

before you get to survive World War
III

Heather and Pham laugh Burt smiles patiently Just then
the compressor in Phams ice cream freezer comes on Its a
loud chug-chug-chug sound mixed with a high-pitched squeal

PHAM VAN
Hey Val listen Bearing going

VAL
Could be

He starts toward the compressor but Earl heads him off

EARL
Catch it later Pham Gotta get

over to Nestors

VAL
Right We plan ahead That way we
dont do anything right now Earl
explained it to me

As they turn to go Val does a take amazed as he spots a
decorative bleached-out cattle skull displayed on the counter
-- with a 2995 price tag

VAL (contd)
Hey Pham Van what the hell is
this

BURT
A beauty isnt it We bought three
of them for the rec room

VAL

We sell em to you for three bucks
a piece

PHAM VAN
(deadpan)
And I appreciate it

VAL
(playfully)
You dont get it Pham The idea
was we were ripping you off

Suddenly a car alarm blares from outside Burts out the
door in a flash The others follow

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Burt races out and shouts at Melvin who back guiltily away
from Burts camouflage Blazer

BURT
Melvin you little pain-in-the-ass

MELVIN

Burt angrily switches off the alarm Val and Earl laugh as
they climb into their truck

VAL
Why dont his parents ever take him
to Vegas with them

EARL
You gotta ask that

EXT PIT - DAY

At one end of town Earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a
scoop-loader blade through a choking cloud of dust scouring
out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole Val sights
down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit The job
is done He signals Earl to cut the engine Both men have
kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with
dust

ANGLE - TRUCK TRAILER - DAY

Nearby is an old battered truck trailer -- the massive solid
steel kind used for heavy rock hauling Tires flat mired in
dried mud and weeds it hasnt been used in years Now it
provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee

NESTOR CUNNINGHAM drives up surveying the pit with approval

NESTOR
It came out great boys Should
fill up just fine come the next
rain Lemme have your bill

Earl and Val start fishing in their pockets for pen and
paper Earl comes up with various pieces of paper Val with
three or four pens Its a moment before they realize each
has the other needed implement Earl writes out the bill
during

NESTOR (contd)
Ill have to send it to you the
first of the month boys

Val and Earl exchange pained looks

NESTOR (contd)
Now you know Im good for it

VAL

They amble over to their truck Earl takes the drivers side
-- and starts fishing in his pockets for the key

VAL (contd)

EARL

No were not too easy-going This
area is economically depressed

Val realizes he has the key and hands it over

VAL
So what if we just did ittoday

EXT VIOLAS PLACE - DAY

CLOSE ON a stencilled sign PHAM VANS U-RENT -- CESSPOOL
SEPTIC TANKS PULL OUT to see Val and Earl have rented a
portable septic pump (perhaps trailer mounted) The aged

machine reeks of and drips with its ignoble cargo The
intake hose has been repaired so often it looks to be more
tape than hose Grimacing Val threads the slimy hose down
through the open top of Violas cesspool

Beside them is Violas well-kept mobile home on a low hill
not far from Pham Vans store Well-kept flower gardens
surround the place VIOLA a sweet little old lady watches
the men work while straining to hold the leash of her tiny
but ferocious dog The dog yaps continuously lunging at
Val and Earl

VIOLA

Val gets up and starts the pumps gas engine

VAL
Well youre the one wont work in

EARL

Earl angrily throws the pump valve and starts the pump
mechanism He and Val on stand either side of the intake
hose as it gurgles happily

VAL

What keeps us doing jobs like this

them with -- well you know They react as if theyd been
shot gagging staggering screaming obscenities

EXT VAL AND EARLS TRAILER - DAY

a framed COORS beer sign in the other Earl unhooks the
clothes line and dumps it clothes and all into the back of

off the mailbox

up their windows during

EARL
Reckon he hated Perfection more

damn shotgun

EARL
Maybe he just couldnt pull the
trigger

VAL

Oh sure he figured it was easier

32 EXT OLD FREDS PLACE - DAY
CLOSE ON the pick-ups tires skidding to a stop PULL OUT to
see were back at Old Freds

VAL
What are you doing

Earl is staring wide-eyed Val follows Earls gaze and is
aghast when he sees --

The sheep pen -- its a ghastly bloody mess Scattered on
the churned up ground a few dismembered sheep legs and heads
are all that remain of the flock

VAL
(whispers)
What the hell

Val and Earl leap out of the truck to investigate

VAL
Hey Old Fred Fred Where are
you

Earl dashes into Freds house Val checks around outside
Earl comes back out

EARL
Not here

Then they spot something lying in the middle of the garden --
Old Freds hat

Still looking all around Val squats distractedly to pick up
the hat He and Earl stumble backward in shock

OLD FRED IS STILL WEARING HIS HAT His mangled face stares
up at them eyes and mouth frozen open in a death grimace

EARL
Oh Jesus

VAL
What the hell is going on I mean
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON

33 EXT CANYON ROAD - DAY
Carmine and Howard continue repairing the road Carmine still
using the noisy jackhammer Val and Earl drive up
EARL

You guys better get the hell outta
here We got a killer on the loose
HOWARD
What

Carmine stops jackhammering to listen

EARL
A murderer man A real psycho
Hes cutting peoples heads off
Im serious Id high-tail for
town if I was you

Val and Earl speed away

CARMINE
Theyre drunk

HOWARD
Yeah

But he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel
pry-bar to keep within easy reach

Carmine goes back to work pounding the asphalt with the
jackhammer Suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the
road something soft We hear a strange unearthly shriek
from underground A weird orange goo gushes up around the
blade Then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a
harpoon stuck in a whale Carmine gets tangled in the jack-
hammers air-hose and is dragged along shouting for help

Howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub-
brush He hears Carmine screaming

HOWARD
Carmine What the hell is it
Where are you

But now there is only silence Howard crashes through the
brush All he finds is the torn end of the air-hose -- which
suddenly sucks down into the ground Hes momentarily
staggered by an awful smell but forces himself to keep
looking He lets the pry-bar drag on the ground Then
something -- it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak -- shoots
out of the ground and grips the pry-bar with uncanny
strength Howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away

He clambers back onto the road But almost immediately
cracks form in the pavement around him More beak-things
break through the asphalt between him and his truck

He dashes across the road scrambling up the embankment He
clings precariously to a tree root looking down -- whered
they go Suddenly the dirt around him begins to bubble
Several hungry beaks break through and grab him yanking him
head first into the embankment Then the embankment gives
way crashing down onto the road taking with it a nearby
telephone pole and snapping the lines

Val stares at the phone
VAL

PHAM VAN

Val and Earl rush out

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Trailed by the others Val and Earl march out and leap into
their truck Val driving now He searches for the key

NESTOR

Earl hands Val the key

VAL
Consider it stepped on

EXT CANYON ROAD - DAY

Again the pick-up barrels through the canyon

VAL
Brother we decided to leave this
place just one day too late you

EARL
(grimly)
Well theres sure as hell nothing
to stop us now Everybody we know
between here and Bixby is already
dead

Earl points ahead and screams

EARL
LOOK OUT

Val brings the truck to a squealing stop Ahead the
collapsed embankment completely blocks the road Its
totally impassable The cowboys are dumbfounded

EARL
Is some higher force at work here
Are we asking too much of life

But Val is in no mood for philosophy He leaps out and peers
into the highway maintenance truck which sits undisturbed
emergency lights still flashing Theres nobody in it He
starts looking around

VAL
Those assholes are supposed to be
fixing the goddamn road
(shouts)
Hey Where are you guys People
gotta use this road you know
You on a booze break or what

EARL
(whispers urgently pointing)
Val Val
Val looks where hes pointing -- Howards bloodstained

hardhat lies at the edge of the landslide Val gets the
point Looking around for the unknown assailant he eases
back into the truck Earl already has a pistol in his lap
and is digging through the glove compartment

EARL (contd)
Where are the bullets Dont we
have any goddamn bullets

Val quickly jockeys the truck to turn it around on the narrow
road But as he backs into the hillside we hear a strange
grating clunk from underneath When he tries to pull
forward the truck wont move The engine stalls

VAL
Jesus I dont believe this

EARL
Youre hung up again

VAL
I am not

They both lean out The rear tires are clear Val restarts
the truck and tries to pull forward rocking the truck
against some unseen pull Smoke wells up from the clutch

EARL
Youre hung up I tell you Youre
gonna burn the clutch

Val slams the truck into low-range four-wheel-drive and revs

it The tires dig in fighting for traction -- and suddenly

the truck lurches free We hear an eerie shriek mingled with
gear and engine noise as Val angrily roars away

EARL (contd)
Jesus you can break an axle like

that
VAL
Fuck you
EARL
Hey I dont want spend the night
out here

EXT PHAN VAMS STORE - DAY

But he stops because theyre all staring wide-eyed at the
rear of the truck

NANCY
My God

Val and Earl jump out and look where everyone else is
looking Their jaws drop REVEAL hanging from the rear
axle of their truck and trailing out behind like a nightmare
wedding decoration -- a sex foot long grotesque fleshy
tentacle The end gripping the axle looks like a vicious
razor-sharp beak or hook The trailing end is mutilated
oozing orange goo -- as though the creature was torn in half

MELVIN
Unreal Whered you get it

The needle responds to each blow on the stake We hear
Rhonda stop pounding The needle stops All is silent --
but the needle starts moving again

BACK TO SCENE

LOW CAMERA is MOVING in Rhondas general direction She
starts to pound another stake CAMERA REACTS so it is moving
straight toward her As it passes a burrow a rabbit
suddenly scouts out CAMERA WHIP PANS to watch the rabbit
scamper into the distance then TURNS BACK to move toward
Rhonda who still pounding her stake

CAMERA passes Rhondas seismograph The machine tilts
slightly as the ground bulges up beneath it

Rhonda finishes pounding She heads for her truck noisily
tossing in her tools and slamming the tailgate CAMERA
CLOSES IN on her faster and faster It is right on her
heels as she climbs into the cab

A beak-thing thrusts out of the ground groping where
Rhondas boot just was Rhonda drives off unknowingly
running right over the thing We hear a shriek of pain as
the tentacle writhes and sucks back under the ground

INT PHAM VANS STORE - NIGHT

Mindy Sterngood poses cautiously with the bizarre hook

tentacle A camera FLASHES and we REVEAL Pham Van taking
her photo beside a sign Photographs -- You and the Snake
Monster -- 200 Viola and Miguel wait in line

We now see the store is crowded with concerned townsfolk
debating what to do and how to protect themselves Val and
Earl sit on the sidelines sipping beer gazing in awe at
enterprising Phan Vam

EARL
Slick as snot and Im not lying

VAL
Fifteen lousy bucks

EARL
A man who plans ahead
Dominating the discussion are Burt and Heather now armed with
scoped magnum hunting rifles Heather stands guard at a

EXT JIM AND MEGANSS HOUSE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT

In the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates Jim
and Megans partially finished house Their station wagon is
parked out front A country and western tune drifts to us
from its radio

As we MOVE CLOSER we see the floodlight is powered by a
small softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away

Jim and Megan both exhausted unload a big stack of roofing
shingles from their station wagon Jim starts to lift a
package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate

JIM
Im dead Lets finish in the
morning

MEGAN
We have to go into Bixby in the
morning

(grins devilishly)

The concrete blocks are in
JIM
The con Oh my God
MEGAN
Just keep looking at that beautiful
sky
JIM
What
MEGAN
Thats the sky thats going to be

over our roof every night when
were done
JIM
(joking)
Ah but consider this if we dont
finish the roof we can looks at
that sky all the time

Just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely
muffled The floodlight flickers Now the generator dies
Darkness engulfs them The car radio music drones on
incongruously

JIM (contd)
Damn that thing

MEGAN
(sarcastic)
We could always buy a new
generator

Jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the
generator Megan lies back taking a welcome breather
After a moment

MEGAN
Well whats wrong with it

JIM (VO)
Itsgone

44 ANGLE - JIM

Baffled he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight Megan
joins him

MEGAN
You sure this is where it was

JIM
Am I sure
(points with flashlight)
It was right there Theres the
cord

The severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone-shaped
depression in the dirt where the generator sat He hands her
the flashlight and kneels We watch tensely as he probes the
loose earth with his hands

JIM (contd)
Maybe the ground caved in Theres
a lot of old mines and stuff around
here

Megan grabs his shirt trying to pull him back
MEGAN
Well dont then You dont want to
fall in

Suddenly about ten feet away -- WHOOMP The generator
shoots up out of the ground Jim and Megan dive for cover as
it sails through the air and crashes to earth They stare
transfixed The generator is dented and bent almost beyond
recognition -- and covered with oozing slime

JIM
What the

But Megan is all action She yanks him back

MEGAN
Come on Get away from it

JIM
God what a stink

We again hear that mysterious rumbling sound Jim stops
sweeping the flashlight around them

JIM (contd)
Hear that

MEGAN
Never mind Lets go Lets just
go into town or something Jim

please
She hustles him bodily toward the car during

JIM
You know I bet its geological or
something like natural gas ora
geyser They stink like that
Remember in Yellowstone

Suddenly he drops knee-deep into ground Megan is thrown
off balance and tumbles to one side The flashlight falls
lighting them at an eerie low angle

JIM (contd)
Somethings got me

We hear sickening CRUNCHES from below the earth He SCREAMS
in excruciating agony

JIM (contd)
Oh God Get me Out GET ME OUT

He struggles wildly but just sinks further down Megan
slides a 2X4 over to Jim He grabs it like a drowning man
trying to keep himself from being pulled down But hes

pulled with suck power the 2X4 snaps

His head is going under Megan desperately tries to dig the
smothering earth away but shes losing Now only his arms
are above ground She pulls with all her might but he sinks
inexorably down down Shes pulled flat on the ground

Hes gone

The next instant a vicious hook-tentacle erupts through the
earth missing Megans face by inches She scrambles back
frantically

ANGLE - STATION WAGON

LOW CAMERA pursues Megan toward the car just missing her as
she dives in through the open tailgate She slams it after
her The talons rake across the car scratching the glass

Megan tumbles into the front seat Thank God the keys are in
the ignition She starts the engine But outside the snake
things attack the car in a frenzy slashing blindly A rear
tire is totally shredded just as

Megan floors it The car lurches forward but the mutilated
tire falls apart The wheel rim digs into the loose earth
and the car is stuck With no other recourse Megan locks
the door rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of
the car panting sobbing The radio is still playing a
happy cowboy tune She peeks out They gave up Shes
safe Nothing happens for a moment then --

The car starts to shake and shudder Dust wells up around the
windows

Outside we see a bizarre sight The earth around the rear of
the car is boiling dirt flying in all directions -- and
the car starts to sink into the ground

Megan wildly honks the horn The car looks just like a ship
going down by the stern hood tilting up gracefully The
back windows shatter dirt pouring in Megan smashes the
windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out
on the hood But theres no hope The car keeps sinking
titling now almost ninety degrees forcing her onto a
precarious perch on the grille -- sinking sinking

Out of her mind with terror she keeps softly murmuring the
same hopeless phrases

MEGAN
Stop it Stop it Somebody stop it

EXT DESERT - JIM AND MEGANS HOUSE - VERY WIDE - NIGHT

The headlights are two ironic beacons sending their beams
skyward through the roiling dust into the night sky The
sound of the radio becomes muffled The headlights sink from
view -- and then Megans scream floats across the desert

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAWN

Out front of Pham Vans nervous Val and Earl saddle up the
horses while Pham loads their saddle bags with food Every-
one has gathered to see them off Theres an air of tension

VAL
(eyeing the horses)
Pham we dont want to be stuck on
a couple of canners They better
be fast

EARL
Relax A snake thing like that
couldnt move too quick

VAL
Screw you For all you know they
could fly

Earl pulls their old Smith and Wesson revolver and battered
Winchester rifle out of the pick-up truck

EARL
You want the rifle or the Smith

VAL
(definite)
The rifle

So does Earl He raises his hand They swiftly do a round
of scissors-rock-paper Earl loses He hands Val the rifle
Just then Burt and Heather pull up in their Blazer climbing
out with their hunting rifles

BURT
You guys all set

EARL
Ready as well ever be

BURT
Heather and I are going to drive
around a little see if we can find
that college girl and tell her to
get her ass back into town

VAL
Good idea And well swing by the
doctors place They were going to
go into Bixby but we dont know if
they left before the road was out

Val and Earl mount up

HEATHER

Hold on You guys oughta take
something that packs more punch
than that thirty-thirty Take one
of our Browning autos or even my
model seventy

(offers her hunting rifle)
Its three-seventy-five H and H
mag

Earl takes the awesome-looking gun with a smug glance at Val

EARL
Geethanks Heather Hope we
dont need it

Heather unhooks a box of cartridges from her belt and hands

it to Earl Suddenly theres a blood-curdling SCREAM The

door to Pham Vans flies open Out staggers Melvin wrapped
in Pham Vans hook-tentacle writhing in apparent agony

MELVIN
ITS GOT ME ITs GOT ME AAAAHGH

People scatter like sheep Burt and Heather have guns
trained on him in an instant Then everyone realizes its a
sick joke Melvin collapses with laughter Burt is livid
He almost shot Melvin He charges over and yanks the kid to
his feet screaming

BURT
You stupid punk You came that
close that close

EARL
One of these days Melvin
somebodys gonna kick your ass

Pham rushes over and grabs his precious tentacle As people
calm down Val and Earl gaze nervously at the vast desert
before them

BURT
Wellyou fellas watch yourselves

NANCY
Come back with the Sheriff

NESTOR
Sheriff like hell Come back with
the National Guard

They ride out to an adlib chorus Keep your heads down
Go careful boys Keep a sharp lookout etc

EXT DESERT - DAY

Val and Earl ride along very tiny in the vast lonely
landscape and very on edge Constantly looking all around

EARL
You know we cant possibly make
Bixby by nightfall

Val doesnt want to hear it

EARL
That means were gonna be out here
like in the dark

VAL
(resentfully)
Great Thank you

Faint Country and Western radio music drifts to them
Theyre nearing Jim and Megans house

EXT JIM AND MEGANS HOUSE - DAY

Val knocks on the door to the mobile home

VAL
Hey doctor anybody here

No answer He opens the door and peers inside Behind him
Earl steps out of the half-finished house and shrugs Nobody
around Wind rustles the plastic sheeting over the windows
Strangely they can still hear the muffled radio clearly

VAL
(spooked)
Oh man I hate this shit

They walk briskly to their horses Earl snatches Heathers
rifle from its saddle scabbard Val pulls out the
Winchester Earl tries to reassure himself

EARL
Cars gone We just missed them
thats all

VAL

Then wheres the goddamn Conway
Twitty coming from

They focus on the sound and walk gingerly toward it keeping
constant watch in every direction The ground here is all
torn up like the sheep pen -- and the music is coming from
underneath What the hell is going on

Val scrapes at the dirt with his boot -- and finds the
headlight of Jim and Megans station wagon still on glaring
up at him He drops down and wildly sweeps away more dirt
revealing more of the cars grille and hood -- and blood -
soaked dirt which sticks to his hand He leaps away
frantically rubbing the blood off on his pants

VAL (contd)
Oh manoh man

EXT DESERT - CONCRETE DITCH - DAY

Val and Earl are riding at full gallop They race alongside
a concrete-lined flood-control ditch and veer off to follow a
barbed wire fence which crosses the ditch

EXT DESERT - BARBED WIRE FENCE - DAY

They ride along the fence during

EARL
Heres the planWe dont even
stop Ride like hell Tonight we
keep right on going Well walk
the horses

VAL
That is the planI mean goddamn
it What the hell are those
things How could they bury an
entire Plymouth station wagon

EARL
Why would they do it

Suddenly the horses stop short In a frenzy they wheel
around rear up refusing to go on The cowboys fight to
control them

VAL
I knew it Pham Van wouldnt know
a decent horse if

But Earls already drawing his rifle

EARL
Shut up They got wind of
something they dont like

VAL
Oh shit

He draws his rifle They look wildly in all directions at
once -- but theres nothing only empty desert

VAL (contd)
But I dont see anything

They keep staring The horses keep pacing nervously Then
-- Earls horse rears wildly and falls Earl goes flying
Val wheels around wildly dismounts and runs to Earl whos
bruised and winded but basically unhurt They think Earls
horse just tripped

VAL (contd)
Hey you okay You okay

EARL
Yeahyeah
(turning to the horse)
What about the hor

Their eyes bulge Several snake things have engulfed the
horses head sucking crushing slurping Vals horse goes
berserk and gallops for the horizon

EARL (contd)
What in the name

VAL
Thats how they get you Theyre
under the goddamn ground

Suddenly they realize what that means -- the thing could
come up under them The cowboys scramble frantically away
But nothing pursues them They pause glancing back
nervously

EARL
What the hell are they

VAL
Sons of bitches

Val raises his rifle and takes a well-aimed shot hitting one
of them Orange goo spurts out We hear a deafening shriek
as all the snake things instantly zip back underground

Then -- A HUGE MOUND OF EARTH RISES UP UNDER VAL AND EARL
The cowboys tumble down its side Val losing his rifle They
roll over and stare dumbfounded at the mound

VAL (contd)
(gasps)

There must be a million of them

The mound of earth turns toward them The ground splits open
and out rises -- a huge head

EARL
(awestruck)
Nopejust one

The monster is a horrendous thirty-foot long eating machine
Its head is eyeless utterly alien covered with tough boney
plates which close together to form a cork-screw point

The cowboys stumble back toward the fence in speechless

terror The creature slides toward them pushing through the
earth like a whale through water Now it opens its mouth --
but its like a grotesque flower boney plates spreading open
like petals revealing a huge slimy fleshy oozing orifice
And inside the mouth a ghastly multi-tentacled tongue

These are the snake things not snakes at all but actually
the horrid hook-tentacles that can shoot out six feet to snag
their prey

The monster snorts and snuffs throwing up plumes of dust
sounding like a horrendous pig It sinks into the earth and
charges We see the hump of earth move toward them faster
and faster but then it disappears as the creature goes deeper

Val and Earl leap sideways and run along the fence The
creature goes straight and slams into a fencepost from below
All we see is the fencepost knocked at a crazy angle

The cowboys keep running The creature regroups and charges
after them hitting each fencepost in turn sending weird
sinuous shock waves along the barbed wire making almost
musical twanging sounds Val looks back

VAL
Its gaining on us

And as if that werent enough Earl points to more trouble
ahead

EXT CONCRETE DITCH - DAY

The fence runs straight to the edge of the ditch an eight
foot wide gap yawning dead ahead The creature churns like

a locomotive from behind Theyll have to try to jump They
strain desperately for every last fraction of speed

EARL
We can do it we can do it

They leap and -- they dont do it They smack into the
opposite side of the ditch clawing frantically at the lip

only to tumble to its sloping bottom A split second later
the charging creature slams like a wrecking ball into the
foot-thick concrete wall The wall CRACKS AND BULGES OUT A
hook-tentacle flops out through one of the cracks Terrified
Val and Earl scramble away But the wall holds together

And the strangely all is quiet The tentacle lays dead
still Eventually the cowering cowboys dare to creep back a
little closer still panting exhausted jumpy

EARL
Stupid son of a bitchknocked
itself cold

And now orange slime begins to ooze through the cracks in the
concrete

VAL
Cold my ass Its dead We
killed the bastard

He suddenly shakes his fist at the dead beast

VAL (contd)
You FUCKER

They allow themselves a small wheeze of nervous laughter
only to jump like rabbits as some pebbles rattle loudly down
the concrete wall behind them They whirl to see Rhonda up
on the opposite side of the ditch staring down at them
Shes lugging a bunch of her equipment including a small
folding shovel

RHONDA
Hi guys howre you doing Look
can I ask you something Did you
just notice something weird
Vibrations You know some kind of
earth tremor

Val and Earl look at each other then burst out laughing
Rhonda spots the cracked wall

RHONDA (contd)
Whats that

EXT CONCRETE DITCH - DAY

The shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal
the creatures horrendous head Start CLOSE on it oozing
blood slavering mouth plates hanging open hook-tentacles
lolling out WIDEN to see Earl and Rhonda sweating dusty
and tired staring in awe and cringing at the stench

EARL
Jesus Christthink it smells like
that cause its dead

RHONDA
I dont see any eyesmust be
totally subterraneanand those
tentacles

EARL
I think they shoot right outta its
mouth hook you and pull you right
in Good thing we stopped it
before it killed anybody else

RHONDA

(shudders)
Yeah Im lucky it didnt find me

(overwhelmed)
This is important you know This
is like well lets say it its
probably the biggest zoological
discovery of the century The
century Forget it History

We can hear a shovel digging up above and now Val shouts

VAL (VO)
I got it Heres the other end
Just look at what we caught here

Earl and Rhonda climb up CRANE UP with them to REVEAL the
whole animal Val digging excitedly with Rhondas shovel
is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creatures
tail The whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is
partially uncovered in king-sized bas-relief

EARL
(hushed)
This is one big mother

VAL
So this is the guy that had your
seismos working overtime

She nods stepping down to study the creature The body is
stream-lined cigar-shaped maybe eight feet in diameter at
its thickest Its covered with hundreds of short rear-
pointing retractable spikes Rhonda gingerly jiggles one
It can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger

RHONDA (contd)
It must push itself along with
these Hundreds of them pushing at
once Thats how it can move so
fast I mean this thing was
tripping sensors all over the
valley No wonder I couldnt
A chilling thought stops her in mid-sentence She springs
down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack pulling out
her seismograph printouts She studies them frantically
during

EARL
Hey Rhonda you ever heard of
anything like this before

VAL
(elbows Earl)
Sure Earl everybody knows about
them We just didnt tell you
Come on nobodys ever seen one of
these Were really in on
something here

The guys looks at each other One thought immediately springs
to their minds

EARL
Pham Van dont get his mitts on
this for no measly fifteen bucks
VAL
You got that right

While they bask in their fame-to-be Rhonda continues to
study the print-outs coming to a terrifying conclusion

EARL

Heres the plan well get aa
flatbed I guess with a big winch
figure a five ton anyway

VAL
Naw dont want to winch it Thatd
tear it all up Want to lift it
Some kind of crane with lifting
straps

But Rhonda interrupts -- now really scared

RHONDA
Hey hey shut up The way I
figure it There are five more of
these things

Val and Earl shut right up Earl edges up a fencepost Val
sidles up onto a rock during

EARL
Five more

Rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts pointing out
jagged ink lines on the graphs comparing different ones

RHONDA
Yeah darn it look Ive got
seismographs all over the valley
If you compare the different
readings there have to be five
Heres one at two oclock
yesterday but heres another one
three miles away at the same time
So thats two Now here

The men leap from their perches and hustle her in the
direction she came from

VAL
Well take your word for it

EARL
Yeah Wheres your truck

RHONDA
The other side of that dome

She indicates what to most of us would be a hill dotted with
huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big
mushrooms The trio jogs toward the hill

EXT DESERT - SEISMOGRAPH - DAY

En route to the truck they pass near one of Rhondas
seismographs Suddenly Earl stumbles as one leg drops knee-
deep into the ground He screams Val wheels and bodily
yanks him up They back away from the small hole in the
ground calming a little as they realize

EARL
Prairie dog burrow

VAL
Little sons of bitches

Rhonda tenses as she hears a sound she knows well -- the soft
scratching of the seismograph needle across its paper
cylinder She whacks Val on the shoulder and points
speechlessly at it

INSERT - SEISMOGRAPH

The needle is going wild

BACK TO SCENE

She doesnt have to explain All three of them dash dash for

EXT BOULDER FIELD - DAY

The remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the
boulders Val Earl and Rhonda scramble over the wood up
onto the rock and stand there tensely

In a moment the creature gently rustles the earth at the
base of the rock The monsters slimy hook-tentacles slither
out searching the rock base Shuddering the humans move as
high as they can well out of reach The tentacles slip back
beneath the earth Everyone breathes a sigh of relief

EARL
Well at least the bastard cant
climb Pardon my French

RHONDA
Probably couldnt move too easily
on the surface

VAL
God the live ones smell worse tan
the dead ones

EARL
Okay now how fars your truck

Rhonda points They can see the roof of her truck maybe a
hundred yards away through the boulders Val and Earl think
about it

VAL
I dont know If this ones any
faster than that other one

EARL
(nods)
I think we wait right here

DISSOLVE TO

EXT BOULDER FIELD - SUNSET

Its hours later Stiff and uncomfortable they have nothing
to do but theorize

RHONDA
Theres nothing like them in the
fossil record Im sureOkay so
they predate the fossil record
(not buying it herself)
Thatd make them a couple of
billion years oldand weve just
never seen one till now Right

EARL
Id vote for outer space No way
those are local boys

VAL
(joking)
Atomic testing Or no bio-
engineering The government built
them a big surprise in the next
war

Theres a long pause Earl stares at the dirt around the
rock

EARL
Wellhavent seen a sign for
hours Maybe its long gone

VAL
Maybe it is Why dont you take a
little stroll and see

EARL
Fuck you too Pardon my French

RHONDA
Well weve got to do something

Val gets an idea He grabs a post from the dilapidated fence
and cautiously slips down near the boulders edge

EARL
Watch yourself Its got a good
six foot reach

Val nods Dead silence as he reaches way out with the post
and scrapes it on the ground Almost instantly the creature
roars up grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and
lashing tentacles nearly hooking Vals hand Val
practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety

VAL
Son of a bitch

EARL
Son of a goddamned bitch Been
waiting there all this time How
the hells it even know were still
here

VAL
Its been listening to us Its
got no eyes It sure as hell cant
smell anything underground so I
figure

Rhonda stares at Val impressed

RHONDA
Of course It can sense the
slightest seismic vibrationhear
every move we make Especially on
this rock Its a perfect
conductor

They all settle back having no idea what to do next Rhonda
gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean

RHONDA (contd)
I always wanted to be stuck ona
desert island But somehow I
always imagined you know water

EARL
You know I hate to be crude but
Im gonna have to take care of some
business here

VAL
(emphatic)
Me too

RHONDA
(just as emphatic)
Same here

The silhouettes shift Val and Earl moving down one side of
the rock and Rhonda down the other We can no longer see
them We just head zippers zipping down -- then soft sighs
of relief from Val and Earl Then

RHONDA (VO)
(softly)
Darn it

You okay

RHONDA (VO)
Yeah But Ill tell you if you
ever wanted proof God is a man

Rich orange sunlight creeps silently across the deathly still
desert Earl is already awake Val is curled up without his
jacket shivering He wakes with a start Where the hells

Rhonda wakes slowly Shes surprised to find herself wrapped
in Vals jacket Touched by his chivalry she embarrassedly
hands it to baffled Val

RHONDA
Thanks

Val glances at Earl who looks away Who me

VAL
(to Rhonda)
No problem Anytime

Earl gropes through his pockets coming up with only
cigarettes Val fishes in his own pockets finding only
their lighter They exchange items and light up during

EARL
Well folks whats the plan

VAL
First lets see if Stumpys still
out there

This time he tosses a piece of wood out onto the sand With
soft rustling a bulge forms in the earth moves over to the
wood then subsides Rhonda starts looking around during

EARL
Dont he have a home to go to

VAL
(grim)
Well thats why Edgar never got
down off that tower

RHONDA
I might have an idea

EARL
(ignoring her)
Were gonna have to come up with
some kind of plan or its just
gonna wait us to death
RHONDA
Well I was wondering if we
could

VAL
Well lets just run for it We
outran that one yesterday at least
on a sprint

Rhonda gives up on them She goes over and pulls a long
cross rail from the fence during

EARL
Run for it Runnings not a plan
Running is what you do when the
plan fails Youre not even trying
to come up with a plan

VAL
Well its not like weve got a
hell of a lot of options

RHONDA
(interrupting)
You guys know how to pole vault

They watch in surprise as she hefts her pole checks the
balance eyeballs the distance to the nearest boulder Then
she charges between them plants her pole and vaults smoothly
over to the next boulder maybe fifteen feet away The
creature surfaces where her pole touched down but too late
-- a hook tentacle vainly sweeps the area the disappears
into the ground Val and Earl glance at each other
impressed

RHONDA (contd)
We just stay where it cant get
uson these residual boulders
My trucks parked right next to
one

Earl rushes to grab a couple more fence rails

EARL
Stay on those residual boulders

Val just stands staring across at Rhonda -- his horizons are
broadening Earl stuffs a fence rail into his hands

EARL (contd)
(pointedly)
Tammy Lynn Baxter she do a lot of
pole-vaulting

Earl takes a deep breath and goes for it vaulting across to
Rhonda Val follows

EXT BOULDER FIELD - WIDE SHOT - DAY

Through the shimmering heat in the distance we see the
strange sight of the three figures vaulting from boulder to
boulder

EXT BOULDER FIELD - RHONDAS TRUCK - DAY

Val Earl and Rhonda pole-vault their way toward the truck
Finally theyre at the nearest boulder but the truck is
still ten feet away

VAL
Think its still following us

RHONDA
Lets assume that it is

EARL
And once we hit that truck we gotta
go fast I say we all jump together

Rhonda and Val nod Rhonda grips her car keys in her teeth

RHONDA
(through clenched teeth)
Ready

VAL
Yeah One two three

They all vault in unison landing in the truck bed Rhonda
scrambles up slides open the cabs rear window and begins
wriggling through headfirst

EARL
(whispers)
Come on girl it aint gonna give
us much time

Dust explodes around the rear of the truck Hook-tentacles
snake up on all sides narrowly missing Val He and Earl
grab whatevers handy pounding at the tentacles with
expensive instruments

VAL
Go GO Go

Rhondas only half way through the cab window still hanging
headfirst into the cab She frantically starts the truck
dives down and punches the accelerator with her fist

As the truck roars away one tentacles manages to tear off the
the muffler The engine thunders like a tank Val and Earl
sit back sighing in relief then react when they see

Rhonda is driving upside down and blind

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Rhonda skids her noisy truck to a halt in front of Pham Vans

VAL
We better get everybody together

Val leaps out and jumps into his pick-up truck He searches
for the key

EARL
You go north Ill go south

VAL
Right

Val holds out his hand for the key Earl tosses it to him
Val drives off We FOLLOW Rhonda and Earl as they drive the
other way toward Violas

EARL
Ill bet youre sorry the college
ever sent you up here

RHONDA
Well Im scared but Im not
sorry

EARL

You know Val went to that college
too For a whole year Couldnt
quite sit still for it though

Had too much vinegar in his system
But once he settles down forgets
this cowboy stuff hell be one in
a million

Rhonda sees straight through Earls clumsy attempt at match-
making She cant help but smile Earl grins sheepishly

EARL (contd)
All right Im about as subtle as
a donkeys ass Pardon my French
Im just saying the boys got
potential thats all

MOVE IN on Rhonda -- her and Val
INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Nestor Viola Nancy and Miguel nervously crowd around Val
Earl and Rhonda Viola holds her yappy dog which perio-
dically snarls and snaps at people Pham Van is on his CB
radio trying to contact Burt and Heather

MIGUEL

VAL
Ask me that after you meet one I

NESTOR

VAL
Nestor damn it these things are

NANCY

Nancy rushes out

EARL
Hey Pham wheres Burt and Heather

PHAM VAN

RHONDA
If youve got a radio why arent

police or

PHAM VAN
Cant reach outside the valley
You know because of the mountains

MIGUEL
Hey Rhonda whats the name you
call those things huh

PHAM VAN
Whered they come from

RHONDA
Huh I dont know

PHAM VAN
Youre a scientist right

VIOLA
You should have a theory at least

RHONDA
Look these things are absolutely
unprecedented

NESTOR
Yeah but whered they come from

RHONDA

(exasperated)
Whered they come from Okay
worms probably in the Jurassic
period Cosmic radiation was much
higher thenso they mutatedand
they got so big they just sank
right into the ground and fell
asleep But now continental drift
has brought them to the surface
ready to be harvested by the
ancient alien meat growers who
planted them here

Everybody stares at her then they smile realizing shes

pulling their legs

EARL
Youre right dont matter where
they come from

VAL
Right We need to be talking about
what were gonna do

VIOLA
My goodness Valentine once they
see the road is out and the phone
lines are down someone will be
along to look in on us Dont you
think

EXT CANYON ROAD - DAY

We see the utility truck still parked near the landslide
blocking the road REVEAL on the far side a telephone

maintenance truck is now parked emergency lights flashing --

and nearby amid phoneworkers climbing and repair gear
more hard hats lying on blood-soaked ground

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

The crowd is still jabbering away Rhonda speak over them

RHONDA
No no no they listen They can
sense the slightest vibration
through the ground Thats how
they see Thats how they hunt

MIGUEL
So like we dont vibrate right
Maybe they wont even come to here
huh Maybe they leave us alone

Val shakes his head and marches over to the topographic map
on the wall

VAL
They caught up with Edgar here
They grabbed Old Fred here They
nailed the asshole dog here And the
doctors place is here

The spots he indicates describe a line leading along the
valley straight toward town

VAL (contd)
This valleys just one long
smorgasbord and if we dont haul
ass outta here were the next
course

We hear an a eerie SHRIEK from outside Something shoots in
through the window striking Earl in the chest Earl flails
frantically at it -- but its only Melvins basketball We
glimpse Melvin outside doubled over with laughter Earl
grabs the ball and hurls it viciously back but Melvin easily
dodges it

EARL
You little ass wipe You knock
that off or youre gonna be
shitting that basketball Pardon
my French

NESTOR
(to Val)
Now Val lets assume theyre as
dangerous as you say Where are we
going to go thats safer than right
here

VAL
Rhondas got an idea about that

RHONDA
Yes see they move very easily
through the Pleistocene Alluvials

(off their blank looks)

the dirtthe loose soil that
makes up the valley floor But
they cant move through solid rock
I think we should travel west to
the mountains

EARL
You know up the jeep trai

RHONDA
The mountains are solid granite
Wed be safe there and we could
hike along themall the way to
Bixby if we have to

EXT EDGE OF TOWN - DAY
Nancy rushes back toward Pham Vans still looking
NANCY
Mindy Mindy

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Were CLOSE on Melvin as he circles around the back of Pham
Vans bouncing his basketball mischief in his eyes We can
hear the townsfolk inside

VIOLA (VO)
No Valentine Im not leaving my
place

VAL (VO)

Well its gonna take us days to
get back with help

EARL (VO)
Doggone it Viola its just plain
crazy to stay

Then to Melvins astonishment the steady rhythm of his
bouncing basketball suddenly stops The ball just goes flup
and doesnt bounce back up to him He looks down No ball
Just swirling dust at his feet

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Everyone jumps as we once more hear an ear-shattering SHRIEK
from Melvin Earl snarls and heads for the door Val right
behind them

EARL
Im gonna kick his ass

VAL
Im gonna help you

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Val and Earl are well ahead of the other townsfolk as they
march around to the side of Pham Vans But wheres Melvin
Nothing out here but the oppressive hot desert silence
Then they hear a soft shuddering whimper -- from above
Theres terrified Melvin halfway up a telephone pole
clinging to it desperately

Val and Earl freeze in their tracks and glance at each

other realizing instantly whats up Without a word they
leap desperately in opposite directions Like a breaching
whale a creature roars up through the earth right where they
were standing great mouth gaping open slimy tentacles
lashing in all directions

The townsfolk scatter some heading for their homes
including Viola and Nestor Others scramble over each other
as they pile back into Pham Vans The telephone pole
shudders Melvin falls and scampers for the nearest hiding
place a corrugated tin storage shed near Pham Vans

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Val Earl Rhonda Miguel and Pham Van rush in

MIGUEL
Jesus Christ Man you gut a gun

PHAM VAN
Big as a house What are we gonna
do
RHONDA
Quiet QUIET
Miguel and Pham shut up Then we hear something new -- the

building itself creaking and groaning like a ship The
liquor bottles behind Pham Vans bar vibrate and clink The
creature is moving beneath the building The people freeze
like mannequins Now we can hear its pig-like snorting
Pham Van and Miguel react as the awful smell percolates up
through the floorboards Val signals them to keep quiet

Finally the creaking stops

Rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper

RHONDA
Rememberno noise No vibration
Everyone stands stock still -- and sweats But then slowly

we become aware of a faint yet oddly familiar sound
Squeak squeak squeak -- Mindy on her pogo stick They all
scramble to the windows

EXT MAIN STREET - DAY

There she is alone in the vacant street Walkman blaring in
her ears merrily bouncing along to a rock n roll beat

ANGLE - PHAM VANS STORE

Thoughts of personal safety vanish as the horrified people
lean way out the doors and windows and shout with one voice

CROWD
(ad lib)
MINDY
Get off your pogo stick
Get in here girl
Run Mindy

ANGLE - MINDY

She cant hear them over her Walkman A tell-tale puff of
dust spurts up not fifty feet from her

ANGLE - PHAM VANS STORE

Val sees Mindy has only seconds left He vaults straight out
the window and charges toward her Right behind him comes
Earl and Rhonda

ANGLE - NANCY

As she rounds a corner at the opposite end of town She
spots Mindy then sees Val running She starts running

NANCY
Mindy Mindy

ANGLE - MINDY

Shes lazily bouncing in circles -- squeak squeak squeak
She goes wide-eyed as she rotates to see Val coming at her
like a mad bull arms outstretched The asphalt under her
pogo stick cracks and --

Val tackles her both of them tumbling head over heels She
scrambles up rubbing her skinned elbow and yelling

MINDY
Oww Val you hurt me

Val claps his hand over her mouth She goes wide eyed as she
sees her pogo stick standing straight up in the cracked
asphalt Then it is sucked down like so much spaghetti

Nancy rushes into frame hugging Mindy Val signals her to
be quiet They sit uneasily Wheres the creature
Suddenly the pogo stick erupts out of the earth right in
their midst

Val runs one way Nancy and Mindy the other heading up the
street toward their house Val scrambles up onto his pick-up
truck The creature rams the truck rupturing a tire As it
shakes the truck violently Val spots Rhonda and Earl now
standing uncertainly halfway between him and Pham Vans

VAL
Go back for chrissake

Rhonda and Earl hesitate

EARL
We gotta get him off there Itll
suck that truck down

But Earl now hears something behind them Down the street
a little wall of cinder blocks framing Violas driveway
suddenly topples over

EARL
Oh Jesus Rhonda another one

ANGLE - LOW CAMERA - RHONDA AND EARL

CAMERA charges toward them Earl swerves toward Pham Vans
but Rhonda is cut off She heads toward the next nearest
haven

EXT STORAGE SHED - DAY

The storage shed where Melvin is hiding It sits ina
vacant weed-choked lot Crashing through the weeds Rhonda
has almost reached the shed when she is suddenly brought up
short and slams face down in a cloud of dust

She cant get up Somethings got her Shes caught in an
old rusted barbed wire fence lying almost flat hidden in
the weeds Some strands have come loose and are curled up
like vicious concertina wire

Barely has she taken this in when -- the ground caves in
under her She rolls wildly to one side as hook-tentacles
snake up missing her by inches She keeps rolling-crawling-
scrambling -- anything to get away from the awful maw -- but
gets her legs hopelessly tangled in the barbed wire She
freezes The creature feels around where she was

She calms herself pulling gingerly at the wire working
tensely to free herself but --

The creatures mouth slams shut on the fence Like a spider
sensing something caught in its web the monster knows its
on to something Its hook-tentacles shoot forward to snare
three feet of fence then the creature lunges up and out
swallowing that three feet in a big gulp and yanking Rhonda
violently toward it She screams pants ripped legs slashed
and bleeding GULP Shes dragged even closer

EXT MAIN STREET - THE PICK-UP - DAY

The truck shakes and shimmies as Vals creature tries to pull
it down Val sees that Rhondas in trouble He searches
frantically for a weapon -- and finds one -- a CHAIN SAW He
leaps as far from the truck as he can and hits the ground
running yanking furiously on the saws starter cord

EXT STORAGE SHED - DAY

Rhonda is in a dead panic thrashing helplessly in the barbed
wire The beast takes another gulp of fence wrenching her
within inches of a probing hook-tentacle Suddenly we hear a
nasty ROAR as Vals chain saw swings in slicing the squirm-
ing tentacle in half spraying gore everywhere The creature
unleashes an unearthly shriek and the other tentacles
recoil The severed one writhes like a beheaded snake

Val yanks off Rhondas boots

VAL
Come on Outta your pants
jeans

She frantically claws at her belt But in mere seconds

RHONDA
(pointing)
LOOK OUT

Tentacles snake out to regain their grip on the fence Val
grabs the saw and starts slashing wildly but this time the
hook-tentacles snag it and wrench it from his grasp It
slams to the ground motor dying The monster readies itself
for the lunge that will suck Rhonda in Val grabs her under
the arms and pulls Rhonda wriggles wildly to get out of her
wire enmeshed pants

The creature lunges Rhonda pulls free She and Val tumble
backward The creature gets only a mouthful of Rhondas

The next instant the second creature explodes up through the
ground right next to fallen Val and Rhonda They roll
sideways come up running and sprint for Pham Vans along an
old wooden sidewalk

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Earl flings open the front door Val and Rhonda race toward
the porch Right on their heels the creature ripples the
boards like an ocean wave
EARL
Come on Come on Dont look back
Just run Run like screaming fuck

They dive through the open door of Pham Vans The rippling
boards zoom on past it Earl quickly eases the door shut

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Earl turns to breathless Rhonda
EARL
(whispers)

Pardon my French

DISSOLVE TO

INT PHAM VANS STORE - LATER

Its a tense edgy group Every movement made is in slow
motion every word is a whisper They gaze grimly out the
windows at the silent deserted heat-shimmering main street

Val gingerly dabs iodine onto the cuts on Rhondas legs
She doesnt even wince

VAL
You paying attention This oughta
hurt like hell

RHONDA
It does

She smiles at him

RHONDA (contd)
So is that one of your usual jobs
saving peoples lives

VAL
(embarrassed)
First time for me

She gazes at him He looks away Over at the bar Pham
holds up a new pair of pants for Rhonda

RHONDA
Oh thank you

Grateful for something to do Val eases over to get the
pants Rhonda looks after him Then she becomes aware of
someone staring at her Its Earl giving her a big Cheshire
cat grin that says What did I tell you

Pham hands the pants to Val Then Pham and Miguel reach
simultaneously for a sods bottle and -- knock it over It
rolls all the way down the bar as a flurry of desperate hands
try to stop it No good It rolls off the end and -- CRASH

Everyone freezes Sure enough the building shudders Floor
boards creak and bend as searching tentacles thump and scrape
along under the floor People close their eyes not even
breathing Finally the noise subsides Everyone relaxes --
a little

MIGUEL
So what are we gonna do you know
How long till they go away

EARL
(shakes his head)
They got the patience of Job They
just sit and goddamn wait til they
hear something that sounds like
lunch We need a plan

PHAM VAN
Ive got a plan You and Val take

your truck get to the mountains
Hike to Bixby Get us some help

VAL
Those scumsuckers are my radials
Pham

RHONDA

Well we can take my truck then

EARL
No good You need major four-
wheel-drive just to get up that
jeep trail

They all shut up when they hear Violas dog yapping in the
distance

EXT VIOLAS TRAILER - DAY

Up the hill across from Pham Vans the old trailer looks
perfectly peaceful Except Violas dog keeps yapping Then
we hear panicked Viola

VIOLA (VO)
Quiet Quiet you hateful thing

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

EARL
Shut it up Shut the little
bastard up

VAL

Chuck him out the door Like a
little hors doeuvre

INT VIOLAS TRAILER - DAY

We hear a loud whap The dogs bark simply changes to
piercing yelps It would be funny except --

The trailer suddenly bucks upward hit from below as though
by a pile driver Again and again the unseen creatures slam
into the frail structure

VIOLA (VO)
Get away Get away Oh God in

heaven help me

The trailer is finally knocked right off its foundation It

tips over and tumbles all the way down the hill As the dust
clears all is silent A huge hole is torn in the trailers
floor Violas possessions are scattered everywhere

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

Everyone stares in shock

RHONDA
Oh my God

EARL
Son of a bitchin lowlife putrid
scum

VAL
Gotta do something Gotta get the
bastards

MIGUEL

(hopeless)

Man what the hell can we do to
those things

EARL
Well were sure as hell not going
to sit here being quiet for God
knows how long Are we

PHAM VAN
Now wait a minute Earl I got
enough food here to last us for
weeks Those damn things cant
wait around forever

(pause)
We can do it I mean if we have
to right

Everyone turns away from the windows gingerly sitting down
glumly pondering this possibility There is a long silence

Then suddenly -- ROAR The silence is shattered as Pham
Vans big freezer compressor suddenly comes on

EARL
Jesus Shut it off

Pham runs to the freezer Its onoff switch is buried behind
stacks of soft-drink cases He tears at them like a madman
toppling them this way and that Earl and Val join him

But right behind Pham the floor BUCKLES UP a monsters

snout BURSTING THROUGH and engulfing one of his legs The
creature starts to back down into the jagged hole dragging
screaming Pham with it Val Earl Rhonda and Miguel grab

Phams arms but are no match for the monster It shakes and
spins him like some gigantic dog effortlessly throwing them
off relentlessly pulling Pham down

The hole in the floor is too small for Pham to fit through

As one leg goes down the other is bent hideously backward
Pham screams and screams as jagged wood tears into him bones
snap ribs crack The others grab him again but are utterly
helpless With vicious powerful jerks the creature yanks
his man mangled body down The last thing we see is his foot
now folded back past his head and hes gone

Val is wild with helpless anger

VAL
Son of a bitch Son of a bitch

The floor bulges up in another place A second creature

Then a third coming RIGHT UP UNDER THEM Earl sprawls onto
the bar Rhonda springs onto the shelves in the middle of the
store knocking groceries everywhere Val and Miguel climb up
shelves which cover the rear wall of the store

The whole building shakes and shudders dust powdering down
from the ceiling Flailing tentacles are everywhere
slashing open food packages clouds of flour fill the air

Val spots a hatch in the ceiling

VAL
Everybody This way The roof

Earl leaps from the bar to the rear shelves Val and Miguel
slide sideways till theyre beneath the hatch then use the
shelves as a ladder climbing up to the hatch Val pounds on
it frantically

In the middle of the store Rhonda leaps from shelf to shelf
trying to get closer to where Val is Soon she reaches the
last one balancing precariously But a creature tips over
the first one The shelves topple like dominoes crashing
toward Rhonda She is half catapulted half jumps right
through an open window ripping through the screen

Val sees whats happened With maniacal strength he smashes
open the hatch and climbs out onto --

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

Val rushes to the edge of the roof shouting

VAL
Rhonda Keep moving Dont stop

He looks down where Rhonda fell Shes not there He hears

a whistle and is relieved to see

EXT WATER TOWER - DAY

Rhonda is perched as high as she can get on the water tower
near Pham Vans Its maybe twenty-five feet tall a simple
wood frame holding a big galvanized tank The wooden legs
stand on big concrete anchors buried in the ground

EXT STORAGE SHED - DAY

Melvin peers terrified out the shed door up at the guys on
Pham Vans roof

MELVIN
Hey Whats going on man What

MIGUEL
Melvin shut the hell up

Its too late Wham A creature strikes The little shed

shudders dust puffing from every old seam Ina split
second Melvin has climbed to the shed roof

EXT BURT and HEATHERS HOUSE - DAY

Burt and Heathers place about a mile from town is no-
nonsense functional ugly -- unpainted concrete walls no
yard chain-link fence Burt and Heather drive up in their
big Blazer and park right beside the house Hot and tired
they climb out each carrying a heavy scoped hunting rifle
Burt peers toward Perfection through binoculars during

HEATHER
I cant believe it No tracks no

BURT
Yeah whatever they are youd
think after they ate all those
sheep theyd have to take a dump
someplace
(reacts to what he sees)
What the hells going on in town

EXT PERFECTION - TELEPHOTO - BURTS POV - DAY

The town is a very strange sight Its as though an
invisible flood were in progress driving people to high
ground We see Rhonda perched on the water tower Val Earl
and Miguel on the store roof Nancy and Mindy on their roof
Melvin on the storage shed Nestor on his roof

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

Val Earl and Miguel gaze out at the town trying to concoct
a plan Suddenly Earl perks up The men speak softly

EARL

truck with our spare

Val stares at him incredulous
VAL
How the hell long it take you to

Just about too damn long Bolt
patterns probably wrong anyway

VAL
We need another plan

Suddenly down in the store Pham Vans CB radio squawks
loudly

BURT (VO)
Yo PV Burt here Come back

The building shudders as the creatures again smash through
the floor inside looking for the source of the noise Val
Earl and Miguel scramble to the edge of the roof

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

The CB radio sits on a shelf near an open window Tentacles
are feeling along the wall just below it Val appears out-—
side the window -- upside-down He snatches the radio and is
hauled straight up out of frame

A few feet away Heather works at their ammunition reloading
bench She dumps a few hundred empty cartridge cases into a
and switches it on It HUMS loudly as it

case cleaner
vibrates

INT PHAM VANS STORE - DAY

The groping tentacles swiftly suck back below the floor

TILT UP to see out the window some distance away

a couple of

old trash cans topple over as the creature streaks past

beneath them

making a bee-line for Burts

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

Miguel points frantically at the trash cans

Val talks a little louder into the mic

MIGUEL
Oh man theyre going man I
think theyre going for Burt

VAL

Hearing that warning Burt and Heather go into a well-honed
drill They grab their hunting rifles and take positions at
basement windows Burt scans with the binoculars He sees
nothing He glances at Heather She shrugs Nobody coming

(into CB)
We dont see anything Val Now

Val is frantic How do you explain these things

VAL (VO)
Theyre coming underground They
they can dig like a son of a
bitchBig monsters under the
ground Burt Now get the hell
out Hurry

Burt and Heather exchange looks Has Val gone nuts Then
they hear a low RUMBLE growing louder and louder Tools
hanging over the work bench start to shake the decorative
cow skulls on the wall rattle the overhead lights sway --
and then -- everything stops Dead silence except for the
humming of the case cleaner

THEN THE WALL MOVES The wood paneling bulges slightly
Nails pop out The wall is pushed again the paneling
cracks A cow skull falls Burt and Heather level their
rifles and --

A huge creature pushes right through the wall Fully half
its bulbous spiked body writhes into the center of the
room great multi-part jaws drooling open hook-tentacles
lashing out

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

The three men can hear the chaos over the CB

BURT (VO)
Jesus Chri

The CB goes dead The men stare numbly Then drifting
across the desert a soft popping sound The men perk up
they know what it is -- distant gunfire

INT BURT and HEATHERS HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY

The gunfire is DEAFENING as Burt and Heather blast away
Globby blood spurts from a dozen wounds and the creature
pulls back a little The couple keeps firing until magazines
are empty The creature lunges forward again

PAN with Burt and Heather to REVEAL a wall of the basement we
havent seen until now -- a wall covered with guns -- hand
guns long guns riot guns flare guns antique guns
military guns elephant guns

Heather grabs an HK-91 assault rifle slams in two magazines
bottoms taped end to end and opens fire A hook-tentacle
snags her boot yanking her right off her feet Burt pumps
out eight devastating blasts from a twelve-gauge riot gun
severing the tentacle Heather is on her feet in an instant
She expertly flops her double magazine over loading the full
one taped upside-down to it and opens fire again Burt
grabs an AR-15 semi-auto and joins her They lay down
massive fire virtually disappearing in muzzle flash and
smoke Ejected shell cases clatter and clang all around the
room

The guns are empty THE CREATURE IS STILL COMING They back
down the wall desperately grabbing weapons one after
another a lever-action a magnum handgun even a flare gun
which Heather fires right into the creatures mouth
Shrieking in pain the horrid thing thing KEEPS WRIGGLING
TOWARD THEM

Burt and Heather scramble up over a desk to keep something
between them and it Burt smashes open a fancy glass case
holding a huge four-gauge elephant gun He slams in two
gigantic cartridges nearly an inch in diameter He fires
The concussion literally shakes the building The recoil
slams Burt back against the wall

The monster bullets tear monster holes in the monster Great
gouts of curdles blood spew from it -- Burt hit an artery or
something The beast convulses grotesquely then collapses
deflating like a beached whale Burt and Heather stagger
together and hug each other fervently They stare dumbfounded
at the massive dead horror Burt suddenly shouts vehemently

BURT

Broke into the wrong goddamn rec
room didnt you you BASTARD

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

Val Earl and Miguel listen to the silence hoping for some
sign that their friends are alive Suddenly

as quietly as possible

EXT BURT and HEATHERS HOUSE - ROOF - DAY

Burt and Heather peer from their fortress-like roof Burt
spots earth bulging up near the foundation of his house

BURT
(into CB)
One second Val

He grabs the elephant gun and takes two well-aimed shots --
two deafening BOOMS which echo off the distant mountains
But the bullets bury themselves harmlessly in the dirt The
bulge in the dirt moves calmly away and sinks from view
Heather shakes her head

HEATHER
Youre not getting any penetration
even with the elephant gun

BURT
Damn
(into CB)
Val we cant get them Never
figured on having to shoot through
dirt Best goddamn bullet stop
there is Come back

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

The men are disappointed Thats not what they wanted to
hear from Burt Then Earl perks up and grab the CB mic
EARL

BURT (VO)
No problem

EARL
Good Youve got the only truck in
the valley that can make it up that
damn jeep trail So heres the
plan You and Heather go for help
Get to the mountains

But Rhonda interrupts pointing urgently from the water
tower

RHONDA
Hey guys Theyre up to
something

Val Earl and Miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look
down where shes pointing --

A creature is running its tentacles along the buildings
foundation Its a strange more studied movement than weve
seen before

VAL
(to Rhonda)
Whats it doing

RHONDA
Why do you all keep asking me

They all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way
along the wall moving toward a corner of the building
Suddenly Miguel spots something down the next wall

MIGUEL
Hey theres another one coming

Another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall
The two creatures meet at the corner their tentacles touch-
ing rather like ants antennae They they submerge tenta-
cles zipping into the earth Nothing happens for a moment

Then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple
of feet Clapboard siding splits A warped window shatters
(We dont see the creatures only the effect of their shoving
from below) The men nearly lose their balance Then the
corner sinks back down

EARL
What the hell was that all about

114 EXT NANCYS HOUSE - DAY

Nancy and Mindy are still huddled on the roof They dont
make a sound Theyre startled when the house suddenly
groans and tilts as creatures give it a tentative shove
Nancy and Mindy frantically cling to the peak of the smooth
roof The picture windows shatters We hear beams POP and
CRACK dishes CRASH off shelves The front screen door
swings open At last the house slowly settles back down

115 EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

The men are watching Nancys house tensely

MIGUEL
They werent making no noise

VAL
(mind racing)
Theyre studying the buildings
trying to figure them out

Rhonda chimes in from the water tower

RHONDA

VAL
Theyre working together too

EARL
Yeah like they got a plan

BURT (VO)
Breaker there Earl What do you

EARL
(into CB)
Hang on Burt The bastards are up
to something

116 EXT NESTORS HOUSE - ROOF - DAY

Straddling the peak of his steeply sloping roof Nestor
grabs on in panic as the creatures lift the place up slowly
The roof warps Spanish tiles shatter and rain down on the
ground

This causes a flurry of activity Tentacles snake around
where the tiles fell We hear creatures crash through
inside snorting and huffing They attack the house in
earnest shaking it violently pushing the front wall out
till it falls flat The roof collapses on that side Nestor
cant hang on He slides all the way down landing across a
window on the flattened wall The next instant hes grabbed
and pulled through the window right into the ground He
SCREAMS

DOLLY along the ground heading toward the storage shed where
Melvin is All we can see is dirt but we can still hear
Nestor screaming UNDERGROUND His screams get more and more
faint as DOLLY ENDS on

117 EXT STORAGE SHED - DAY

autistically

of the roof with the elephant gun Heather mans the CB

VAL (VO)

HEATHER

VAL (VO)

A hump of dirt raises near the base of the house Burt jerks
the rifle to his shoulder and squeezes off a shot The hump
moves away from the house

HEATHER
Knock it off Burt

BURT
I think I scared it

VAL (VO)
Forget going for help Well all

walk rippling the flagstones gently

HEATHER
(into CB)

you need Come back

VAL (VO)
Theyre tearing down the houses
here We all gotta get outta here
together Now

The hump of dirt passes under Burt and Heathers truck
rocking the vehicle slightly

HEATHER
Were with you Val Well come

The trucks security alarm starts BOOPING Burt and Heather
stare down helplessly as the noisy truck is furiously
attacked by the frenzied creatures Dust flies as metal rips
and tires shred

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY
Val Earl and Miguel listen in disbelief to the distant truck
alarm It finally sputters and dies

HEATHER (VO)
Val were going to have to forget
about the truck

VAL
(into CB)

Theyve hit rock-bottom They sit in helpless desperate
silence

Over on the storage shed roof Melvin is losing it

MELVIN

Miguel nods in agreement Val and Earl stare at him
incredulous

VAL
What Since when the hells

RHONDA
(flatly)
You guys do all the odd jobs

Val just stares at her

Then -- CRASH The store shudders creaks and groans The
creatures are back One corner of the store lifts up beams
splintering Then another corner lifts up The roof tilts
like the deck of a storm-tossed ship From now on the
monsters shake and ram the building almost constantly
Hanging on tight the men peer over the edge

EARL
We dont have a hell of a lot of
time here

Meanwhile Rhonda tries her desperate best to be logical

RHONDA
Look the situation hasnt changed
We still have to get to solid rock
There must be some way

RHONDA
Listen they only respond to

distract them somehow

VAL
Yeah good Something to keep them
busy We need a decoy

EARL
Hey Melvin you wanna make a buck

MELVIN

Miguel grabs Earl and points down at little garden tractor in
a jumble of Pham Vans equipment and tools near the side of
the store

MIGUEL
Hey how about the tractor Start
him up Let him go by itself Let
those things chase it all over is
they like that noise

EARL
(nodding)
Not bad
(to Val)

The store takes a heavy hit The front porch collapses with
a terrific crash

VAL

RHONDA

shouts to Nancy

126 EXT PHAM VANS STORE - TRACTOR - DAY

Val and Earl have lowered Miguel down to a window sill right
above the garden tractor He has used his kerchief to tie
the steering wheel to keep the front wheels straight He
jams the throttle open and signals thumbs-up to Val and Earl
above

127 EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

Val and Earl stride purposefully toward the opposite end of
the roof Realizing they have the same idea each one tries
to edge ahead of the other

VAL

Earl positions himself nervous as hell ready to leap at the
right moment

128 EXT PHAM VANS STORE - TRACTOR - DAY

Miguel leans out precariously and pulls the tractors starter
cord Nothing On the second try it starts He slams it
into gear and sends it out toward open desert The store
shakes under Miguel almost knocking him off the window sill
as two humps of dirt pursue the noisy tractor

MIGUEL
There they go Theyre chasing it

EXT NANCYS HOUSE - DAY

A spout of dust erupts near the foundation as the creature
beneath zooms away toward the new sound Nancy whispers

NANCY

There goes this one Its going

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

The CB radio squawks
BURT (VO)
Hey this guy just took off like a

Earl is poised to leap Val steps up and slaps him on the
back

VAL
Watch your ass shithead

EARL

Val instantly elbows Earl hard in the stomach As Earl
doubles over Val springs off the edge of the roof

EARL (contd)
You goddamn suicidal son of a
bitch
We see Val running for all hes worth -- and theres the
bulldozer at the edge of town a long way away
EXT DESERT - DAY
LOW CAMERA pursues the garden tractor as it bounces along

EXT PERFECTION - DAY

Val charges across the vast open area that separates him from
the bulldozer We can hear the tractor droning along in the
background

EXT DESERT - DAY

The tractor suddenly takes a bad bounce and flips over The
engine dies Total silence

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

Earl Rhonda and Miguel have seen the tractor take a header

EARL
Oh my God

EXT EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY

Vals crunching boots seem incredibly loud in the sudden
silence He hesitates glancing over his shoulder Hes
totally out in the open halfway to the bulldozer Should he
run back or go forward He decides to go for the bulldozer

EXT DESERT - DAY

All four creatures are now heading for Val INTERCUT four
slightly different LOW CAMERA ANGLES speeding over the
ground racing after him He strains to the limit breaths
coming in painful rasps -- but the creatures are closing in
on him with chilling ease

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

Everyone watches in horror

EARL
Hell never make it Theyre gonna
get him
RHONDA
(yells)
VAL STOP THEYRE COMING DONT
MOVE

EXT EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY

Val hears her and stops dead So do the creatures Maybe
twenty feet away their giant snouts poke up out of the

ground one two three four Val stands trembling The
creatures softly shuffle back and forth searching blindly

139A

139A

for him hook-tentacles feeling everywhere One tentacle
sweeps toward Vals boot He manages to lift his foot just
in time letting the tentacle pass beneath it He balances
precariously like a flamingo

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

EARL
It worked They cant find him
(pause)
Okay okayuhwe gotta make
some noisea lot of noise HEY
YOU SORRY SONS OF BITCHES COME AND

He starts jumping noisily up and down Miguel joins in
cursing the monsters in Spanish

EXT WATER TOWER - DAY

Rhonda kicks and shouts But its obvious they need some-
thing louder She spots the aging outlet pipe coming from
the water tank Bracing herself she kicks at it with both
feet It finally gives way at a rusted joint A torrent of
water blasts out thundering into the dirt

EXT EDGE OF TOWN - VAL - DAY

All the creatures wheel about in the dirt and zoom off toward
town Val breathes a big sigh of relief and sprints to the
bulldozer

EXT PHAM VANS STORE - ROOF - DAY

EARL
That did it girl Goddamn good
thinking

EXT WATER TOWER - DAY

A mass of tentacles and snouts swirl through the big puddle
where the water if falling The creatures breathing throws
up spouts of muddy water Rhonda looks down nervously Earl
calls reassuringly from Pham Vans

EARL

Dont worry No way they can lift
that tower I mean its really
heavy

INSERT - CONCRETE FOOTING

The dirt begins to cave in around the towers footing The
creatures are digging the dirt away

BACK TO SCENE

The water tower tilts ever so slightly creaking and
groaning Rhonda frantically grabs a handhold

RHONDA
Theyre not trying to lift it

EXT BULLDOZER - DAY

Val lands in the drivers seat and turns the engine over --
it doesnt start

VAL
NO FUCKING WAY

The old machine starts Val slams it into reverse and backs
up toward the semi trailer

EXT WATER TOWER - DAY

The water tower is starting to tilt seriously Water spills
over the top edge of the tank drenching Rhonda

EXT BULLDOZER - DAY

Val has used heavy chains on the back of the bulldozer to
jerry-rig a hitch to the semi trailer Now he scrambles
back into the drivers seat He guns the engine wrenching
the old semi trailer from years of dried mud and tumbleweeds
Ancient tires disintegrate Rusted wheels screech and
complain -- but it moves Val lets out a whoop and heads
full-tilt for town Hes suddenly shocked as he sees

EXT WATER TOWER - DAY

Rhondas in big trouble She scrambles to the high side of
the tower platform The towers going to tip over at any
moment Its roof slides off and crashes into the street

On Pham Vans Miguel and Earl are tearing apart the swamp
cooler throwing pieces of it off the roof trying to
distract the creatures but they cant compete with the noise
from the water

In BG the bulldozer rumbles toward the tower at top speed --
an excruciatingly slow eight miles per hour

The tremendously heavy water tank suddenly tears loose
sliding off its platform nearly carrying Rhonda with it
She ends up hanging from a cross beam as the water tank
splatters like an enormous egg below sending a small tidal
wave down the street

The remains of the tower tilt crazily nearly forty-five
degrees The bulldozer grinds closer and closer Rhonda
tries to climb up but the jostling and shuddering of the
tower keeps her dangling precariously Suddenly she falls

And lands in the dirt The creatures zero in on her She
turns wildly and leaps for the blade of the approaching
bulldozer The blade is only inches off the ground but Val
swiftly raises it lifting Rhonda high into the air just
above the grasping tentacles

EXT PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY

As Rhonda climbs down into the cab Val heads the bulldozer
over to Pham Vans and stops Almost as soon as he does
creatures attack a frenzy of tentacles grabbing at all sides
of the massive earth-moving machine slithering into the
treads Val and Rhonda watch this nervously as Earl and
Miguel quickly clamber from the roof down into the protective
steel belly of the semi trailer

Val mentally crosses his fingers and sends the bulldozer
roaring forward It effortlessly tears loose from the
tentacles grinding one to pulp in its treads The creature
shrieks in pain The humans cheer At last theyve got the
upper hand

EXT STORAGE SHED - DAY

Melvin dances merrily and noisily on the metal rooftop

MELVIN
Way to go Dumb fucking worms
Now haul ass over here man Me
next Get me off of here
The flimsy shed seems almost to explode as a furious creature
roars up inside The walls buckle out The whole structure
sags Melvin scrambles to peak of the roof

MELVIN
Oh shit Oh God Help

As the unseen creature thrashes around inside the shed the
walls topple outward and the roof drops to the ground like a
pancake Melvin has lost all self control and just keeps

screaming Val pulls along side jumps down onto the tread
and reaches out to Melvin But just as they join hands the
creature hits the roof from beneath dragging it several

feet Val is yanked off the bulldozer and lands with Nelvin
on the roof

The creature slams into the roof repeatedly but the
corrugated metal is both light and resilient It bends but
the frustrated monster cant get enough bite to tear
through it Val and Melvin straddle the peak of the roof
trying desperately to hang on as it heaves up buckling like
bronco

Earl scrambles into the bulldozer drivers seat and heads
after them at full throttle the big diesel roaring

Melvin and Val prepare to jump onto the bulldozer but just
before it reaches them the roof suddenly starts to slide like
some mad flying carpet carried from beneath by a creature
Val hangs on like a rodeo rider struggling to keep fear-
crazed Melvin from tumbling off

151 EXT DIRT DITCH - DAY

The roof zigs and zags spins and twists Melvin and Val
wont be shaken loose Earl does his best to head it off
but its hard to predict which way the roof will scoot next

The rood careens alongside the edge of a dirt-walled drainage
ditch then suddenly skitters sideways and plunges over the
edge Melvin and Val tumble to the bottom As they jump to
their feet

VAL
We got about three seconds

Val sees almost right above them an exposed pipe which
spans the ditch He shoves Melvin toward it They leap up
and grab the pipe pulling their legs up as high as they can
An instant later the creature blasts through one wall of the
ditch roars past beneath them and burrows into the opposite
wall

Earl brings the bulldozer to a thundering stop next to them

EARL
Well come on

EXT NANCYS HOUSE - DAY

Nancy and Mindy huddle together on their roof The upraised
scoop blade of the bulldozer comes INTO SHOT with Val riding
it He helps them step across into it

EXT BURT and HEATHERS HOUSE - ROOF - DAY

Burt is using a hacksaw to cut lengths from a heavy vertical
pipe to which his TV antenna was anchored Heather works
with the sections Burt has already cut off She is filling
them with gunpowder from reloading cannisters and hammering
the ends shut -- theyre making bombs

Then they hear rumbling What is it more creatures Theyre
surprised by the odd sight of the strange contraption
approaching

BURT
(impressed)
God damn Armored transport

Val climbs up on the bulldozer roll cage so hes about even
with Heather and Burt A creature occasionally slams into the
underside of the bulldozer of the semi trailer rocking them
slightly throwing up clouds of dust

VAL
Lets go you two Were headed for
the mountains

BURT
In a minute

He grabs a coil of blackpowder cannon fuse He cuts off a
length and stuffs it in the end of one of the pipe bombs
during

VAL
Come on Burt we cant hold still
long Theyre damn smart and
getting smarter by the minute

Burt hefts the finished bomb
BURT

Thats fine Weve got some new
things to teach them
VAL
Damn it Theyll sink this rig
just like a boat

Just then the bulldozer starts to tilt sideways
digging dirt away beneath it Earl guns it forwa
the depression theyre making

EARL
See that Theyre doing it now
They try it every time we hold
still

Burt and Heather are impressed They rush around
rooftop gathering food ammo guns the finished
handing them to impatient Val who hands them down
in the semi trailer during

VAL
Jesus Christ were only going nine
miles Be there in two hours tops

BURT
Yeah well those things are gonna
be on our ass every foot of the
way right

He holds up to rifles to Heather the HK91 assaul
another elephant gun

Dust flies up The bulldozer tilts Earl guns it forward
again Heather and Burt grab a few more things and leap down

into the semi trailer

MELVIN
Give me a gun Ill take one

BURT
I wouldnt give you a gun if it was

World War Three

Earl pilots the strange looking contraption out into the
desert Burt and Heather watch their fortress-home recede

BURT
Food for five years A thousand
gallons of gas Air filtration
Water filtration Geiger counter
Bomb shelter
(looks heavenward)
underground goddamn monsters

Heather puts a consoling arm around him

EXT JEEP TRAIL - DAY

The bulldozer easily lumbers along the really rough road we
saw Val and Earls truck struggle over the other morning

As they come closer we see Burt and Heather riding shotgun
he sitting out in the bulldozers scoop she on the rear of
the semi trailer elephant guns at the ready Val Earl and
Rhonda are in the cab

EXT CLIFFS - DAY

Its late afternoon sun casting dramatic shadows across the
beautiful desert We are WIDE on the bizarre vehicle
resolutely grinding along not far from the cliffs nearing
the mountains ahead

EXT DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY

As they scan the desert the people are feeling like they may
get out of this after all Earl calls back to the people in
the semi trailer

EARL
Any sign ofem

MIGUEL
Maybe they just gave up you know

MELVIN
Yeah the bulldozers too much for
them man

As they top a gentle rise Burt excitedly points ahead

BURT
There we go solid rock

Everyone cheers But then Heather points up ahead to one
side

HEATHER
Whats that

157 POV - THE GROUP - DUST CLOUD - DAY

Perhaps two hundred yards from them a huge cloud of dust
wells up from behind big boulders

158 BACK TO SCENE

Everyone stares uneasily at the billowing cloud

NANCY
Is it them

MIGUEL
What else could it be

MINDY
Whatre they doing

MELVIN
Maybe theyre taking a dump

RHONDA

EARL
No We go straight

VAL

EARL
I dont care what theyre doing as
long as theyre doing it way over
there

Earl shoves the throttle all the way The engine screams
159 EXT DESERT - DUSTCLOUD - DAY

We MOVE IN through the cloud of dust Dirt is flying by the

ton out of en eight foot diameter hole in the ground A huge
mound of the tunneled-out dirt is already piled high The

creatures are digging a tunnel -- but why

EXT DESERT - BULLDOZER - DAY

We watch the bulldozer rumbling along It seems unstop-
able The mountains and safety are barely a mile away --

when the EARTH CAVES IN THE BULLDOZER PLUNGES NOSE FIRST
INTO AN UNSEEN PIT DUG JUST BENEATH THE SURFACE

The machine ends up half-buried at a steep angle The semi
trailer is right on the edge of the pit Everyone is shaken
bruised bloodied Val Earl and Rhonda look frantically for
Burt who was riding out front in the scoop Theyre
relieved to see him clawing his way out of pit Val hauls
him up and all four of them now leap into the semi trailer
As they come to rest Val slowly realizes whats happened

VAL
Theythey dug a trap I cant
believe this

The idling bulldozer engine coughs and dies There is a
moments crushing silence

Then the dreaded digging begins Dust boils up around the
semi trailer -- creatures digging from below The semi
trailer shakes and shudders slowly sinking The people
huddle together in sheer panic Val and Earl grab the
nearest of Burt and Heathers guns and fire wildly hope-
lessly down at the dirt Ricochets whine into the distance

Burt grimly digs an overloaded knapsack for one of his
pipe bombs He leaps up between Val and Earl and lights the
fuse looking for a target

BURT
Hungry Eat this

He tosses the bomb at some churning earth and dives back into
the semi trailer

BURT (contd)
Keep your heads down

KABOOM The explosion throws up a big plume of dust and
rocks We hear a new very strange sound of pain from the
creatures The semi trailer instantly stops shaking The
creatures have stopped digging All is quiet

The people peer up over the edge of the semi trailer looking
all around Then

RHONDA
There they are

POV THE GROUP - DISTANT CREATURES

Numerous spurts of dust mark their paths as they race madly
away fanning out from the semi trailer

BACK TO SCENE

MIGUEL
Hey Burtdid you get one

RHONDA
No theres still four of them
Seetheres like four different
dust trails

VAL
Sure got their attention though
Nice going Burt
(to Earl)
Earl what about the Cat

Earls already staring down at the bulldozer

EARL
No way Its down for the count

Val looks around
POV VAL - ROCK OUTCROP
Toward the cliffs he sees a big rock outcrop
BACK TO SCENE
Rhonda points in the opposite direction from where Val is
looking
RHONDA
Here they come Theyre coming
back
Heather unexpectedly fire two deafening blasts from her
elephant gun at the approaching creatures then shakes her
head frustrated Theyre still coming
VAL

Come on everybody We gotta run

RHONDA

Well what is you throw one that

(points toward rocks
Then when the explosion happens
if it drives them away againwe
all run like goddamn bastards

(to Earl)
Pardon my French

Wham With a jolt the semi trailer begins shaking and
shuddering again -- sinking smiling

MELVIN
What if it doesnt scare them
What if they dont run

RHONDA
I dont think it does scare them
It hurts them Theyre so
sensitive to sound they have to
run It hurts too much

Glances all around

BURT
Shes got my vote

VAL

Val squats in front of tear-streaked Mindy

VAL (contd)
Mindy you understand what were
going to do
(off her nod)
And dont worry they cant get us

MELVIN
I dont know man Theyre too
fast You cant outrun them no
way

As Burt readies another bomb he pauses to hand bug-eyed
Melvin a huge Ruger Super Redhawk 44 magnum handgun

BURT
Here kid Thisll makeem think
twice

Melvins eyes bug out further Burt lights his bomb

BURT (contd)
Heads down

He hurls the bomb Wait Wait WHOOOM Again we hear the
creatures unearthly shriek of pain Rhondas on her feet

before the rocks stop falling She spots the creatures

RHONDA
It worked There they go

VAL
LETS DO IT

Earl lets out a war wild WHOOP Its infectious CRANE UP
with them as everyone piles out of the semi trailer like

soldiers out of a trench -- they charge across no-mans-land

Melvin runs like a demon He tries to shoot at the first
thing he sees but the gun just clicks over and over -- empty

MELVIN
Burt you bastard

Enraged he doubles his speed trying to overtake Burt

Mindy cant keep up Nancy tries to pull her along Val and
Earl swoop in grab Mindy under either arm and carry her
between them

ANGLE - THE CREATURES

The ground heaves violently as the retreating monsters
angrily wheel about and charge back after the humans

EXT DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - DAY

Big slabs jutting this way and that -- a rock iceberg ina
sand ocean The people scramble onto it amid whoops of joy
and relief Melvin charges up to Burt

MELVIN
You asshole Theres no bullets in
this gun

BURT

Got you moving didnt it

Burts line gets a laugh from people but then tentacles
burst up on all sides of the rock probing feeling The
effect is instantly sobering Burt swiftly grabs out his
remaining bombs -- six of them -- and holds one ready But
theyre in no immediate danger

EARL
Sonow what

RHONDA
Could we make it to the mountains

VAL
(gestures to Burts bombs)
No way Wed need fifty of those
things

The hopelessness of the situation suddenly hits Val Earl
and Rhonda After a moment

EARL
Wellthats it Were not
getting off this rock

VAL
Not going to pole vault anywhere
Thats for sure

HEATHER
Whats the matter with you What
are you talking about

RHONDA
Theyll just wait out there till
were dead Thats what they do

As this sinks in Burt loses his cool igniting an argument
BURT
What Well for chrissake we
could have made a stand at our

place We had food water

EARL
You cant fightem that way

BURT

You two jackasses hauled us way the
hell out here

VAL
BACK OFF BURT

BURT
Well who put you two in charge

NANCY
(shouts)
Burt Those animals would have
killed you

Everyone stares in surprise at normally quiet Nancy

NANCY (contd)
(softly)
You havent seen what they can do

VAL
(calmer)
Theyd have dug your place out from
under you in half an hour

Theres a long grim silence Everyone sits glumly
Finally Burt picks up a bomb and contemplates it

BURT
(losing it)
If it comes to starvation I know
what Im doing Take one of these
Walk right out there with the fuse
lit Stuff it down my pants and
let em take me down BOOOOM

Heather puts a soothing hand on his shoulder

HEATHER
Jesus honey

But now Earl brightens a little

EARL
You know thats not a bad idea

The others react Is Earl nuts
EARL

No I mean it gives me an idea
going fishing like

EXT DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER

In the open desert a rock lands Then another Val

and
Rhonda are throwing them from the rock outcrop

Val Earl Rhonda and Burt have moved away from the main
group to another section of the rock outcrop where
intervening boulders will protect everyone from an explosion

Earl has tied a bomb to some nylon rope form one of Burts
knapsacks Burt places the other bombs safely out of the way
behind a ledge Meanwhile Val and Rhonda keep throwing
rocks Soon the ground shifts

VAL
There Right straight out in front
of you
Burt has his coil of fuse
BURT

How much you think

EARL
I dont know Theyre pretty
quickfifteen seconds

Burt nods expertly eyeballing a fifteen second length and
snipping it off As he stuffs it into the bomb

EARL
What the hell is that anyway

BURT
Cannon fuse

EARL
What do you use it for

BURT
(matter of fact)
My cannon

The bomb is ready -- its moment of truth Earl digs in his
pocket for the lighter -- but Val has it Val nervously
leans over to light the fuse but then frowns as he sees how
Earl is holding the rope

VAL
Come on youre not going to do
your lasso thing

EARL
Hey just cause youre no good
with a rope

Val shakes his head and lights the fuse Earl whirls the
bomb on the end of its rope like a lasso and lets it fly out
as far as he can Then he starts pulling it back in along
the ground like a fishing lure Rhonda stares at her watch
as they all sink down behind the protective boulder

RHONDA
Come oncome on

BURT
Take ittake the bait

Suddenly a snout subtly surfaces and gulps down the bomb A
tense two seconds later -- KABOOOM Bullseye Its a
volcano of gory creature parts They splatter all over The
remaining creatures shriek and race away again The people
cheer wildly

CUT TO

168 EXT DESERT - ROCK OUTCROP - LATER

Val Earl Rhonda and Burt prepare to try again This time
Val has the rope and a new bomb Rhonda stands by him ready
with the lighter Earl lobs rocks out into the desert

EARL
Where the hell are they Hope they
didnt wise up

RHONDA
(pointing)
Nope there Thats one

Rhonda shakily lights the fuse Val heaves the bomb out and
starts trolling The creature swallows it Everyone drops
down behind the boulder Val impulsively grabbing a second
bomb They tense with anticipatory glee -- but the creature
suddenly spits its bomb back out It sails back right over
their heads It strikes the rocks above them skittering
down a crevice and landing in -- BURTS PILE OF BOMBS

Val Earl and Rhonda scatter Burt dives backward over a
rock ledge

BABABAMMM All the bombs explode throwing rocks every-
where The creatures streak away Val Earl and Rhonda
sprawl into the dirt half stunned

When the panic is over Val and Earl realize where they are --
fifty yards out in open desert So is Rhonda off at an
angle from them Only Burt is safe on the rock outcrop

And the creatures are coming back fast

The stranded trio starts back for the outcrop but the
creatures burst up ahead of them -- one blocking Rhondas
path the other two cutting Val and Earl off The creatures
roar toward their easy prey
Val and Earl freeze The ground bulges as the creatures
skid to a halt not ten feet from them Rhonda stands stock
still some fifty feet away eyeing her own creature

Over on the outcrop with the main group of people Heather
sizes up the situation

HEATHER
Make noise Everybody COME ON

Everyone starts hopping up and down yelling screaming and
clapping Burt even runs a few feet out from the rocks
firing a pistol into the dirt

BURT
COME ON YOU SLIMEBAGS OVER HERE
FRESH MEAT

The crowd keeps up the ruckus The creatures are distracted
by the noise but this time they dont automatically go after
it Their big snouts turn uncertainly this way and that

But they just stay where they are Their hook-tentacles
slide out feeling all around Earl whispers

EARL
Theyre not falling for it

Heather takes careful aim with her elephant gun

HEATHER
Ill makeem pay attention
goddamnit

But before she can fire the creatures mysteriously sink from
view Val Rhonda and Earl remain frozen What the hell is
going on Nothing happens -- then --

A HUGE HUMP OF EARTH suddenly wells up near Rhonda It sinks
back down as fast as it appeared Its like the creature
suddenly lifted its whole body almost to the surface then
submerged again Another hump rises and falls right near Val
and Earl Theres a pause as the men whisper

VAL
Theyretheyre trying to make us
move

EARL
Or just knock us over Look use
the bomb

VAL
Its out last one We cant kill
them all

The creatures try another random barrage of humps some
coming perilously close They know theyll eventually topple
their prey One comes so close to Val and Earl that pebbles
roll down its sides into their boots

EARL
Use the fucking bomb

VAL
So we get back on that rock and in
three days were dead anyway

EARL
(slowly terrified)
I want to live for the three days

More humps rise and fall Val gives in He signals Rhonda
gesturing with the bomb She understands Hell set it off
driving away the creatures and theyll all run back to the
outcrop

Val digs for the lighter Doesnt have it Earl digs for
it too But he doesnt have it either They go dead pale
How can that be They look across fifty feet of deadly open
ground -- trembling Rhonda holds up the lighter

Over on the outcrop Burt shouts

BURT
Whats wrong Use the bomb for
Godsake

Val signals to Rhonda to throw the lighter She nods But
just before she does A HUMP STARTS RISING DIRECTLY UNDER
HER She fights to keep her balance -- struggling to keep
from taking that single step which will instantly tell the
creatures where she is

But theres no hope The hump jerks higher Her boots slip
down the gravelly side Instantly the creature twists toward
her its hungry mouth erupting out of the dirt She screams
and dashes for Val and Earl They run to meet her The
other creatures surface The trio is cut off from the rock
outcrop

Val and Earl link up with Rhonda and they all run madly while
Rhonda tries to light Vals bomb fuse But suddenly Val
yanks the bomb away

VAL
No wait This way

He veers off in a new direction Startled Earl and Rhonda
have no choice but to follow As they desperately try to
catch up to Val

EARL
(gasping)
What the hell are you doing

VAL
I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN

Earl looks up ahead Theyre headed right for --

169 EXT THE CLIFFS - DAY

The massive cliffs Earls eyes bug out In seconds theyll
be right at the brink with nowhere to run
EARL
This better be one great plan
As they skid to a stop at the very brink Val breaks off the
bomb fuse leaving only one inch of it He whirls to check
the progress of the advancing creatures
VAL
Get ready
He holds the bomb out to Rhonda She instantly tries to
light it He grabs her wrist so hard it hurts
EARL
Light it man LIGHT IT
VAL
Not yet not yet
The charging creatures are almost underfoot Finally Val
pulls Rhondas hand over to light the fuse Instantly he
hurls the bomb as far as he can behind the creatures
EARL
Too far You threw it behind them
The ground opens under their feet Tentacles snake toward
Val and Earl A horrid mouth clamps onto Rhondas boot She
screams as it starts to pull her down
WHOOOM The bomb explodes The creatures shriek in pain
instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the
painful shock wave in the only direction they can --
170 EXT CLIFFS - WIDE LOW ANGLE - DAY

Right out through the face of the cliffs The huge
shrieking creatures seem to hang in mid-air for a moment
their grotesque bodies undulating in pain And then they
fall And fall and fall -- a thousand feet

EXT BOTTOM OF CLIFFS - DAY

The creatures land on massive jagged rocks exploding like
immense horrid watermelons Multi-colored gore festoons the
whole cliff face

TILT UP to see three tiny figures standing at the top of the
cliff

EXT CLIFFS - DAY

Val peers down at the distant creatures for a long time Then
he notices Earl and Rhonda are staring at him Where the hell
did he get an idea like that After a moment

VAL
Well it just suddenly hit me you
know Stampede

They turn and head back toward the others They laugh as
they realize how stealthily they are walking Val starts
taking big exaggerated stomping steps Rhonda and Earl
follow suit The trio goes off arm in arm stomping merrily

DISSOLVE TO

EXT PERFECTION - MAIN STREET - DAY

Val and Earl roll two scavenged truck wheels down the street
toward their own truck which is up on jacks two wheels
missing

Mindy races past excitedly

MINDY

A highway maintenance truck is rolling into town followed by
a police car The townsfolk happily swarm around the
MAINTENANCE MEN and POLICE OFFICER who gape at the destroyed
town

Val and Earl eagerly start bolting on one of their new wheels

EARL

VAL

Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head

EARL (contd)
Oh my God She got to you You do

VAL

EARL

Val glares at Earl for a moment

VAL

Earl is dumbfounded

EARL

not good enough for you Now

Val lowers the jack letting the truck down
VAL

Earl stands there fuming mind racing A last ditch idea
hits home -- we see a devilish glint in his eye

EARL

Earl hops into the truck

EARL (contd)

Earl starts to drive off Val springs into the passenger
seat Through the trucks rear window we see Val raise his
hand in The Challenge They do a round of scissors-rock-
paper -- but its a tie They go again Another tie They
keep playing and tying as they drive off into the distance
and we --

FADE OUT

THE END
