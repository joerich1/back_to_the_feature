HEREAFTER

FADE IN

Were high up All around us soft white clouds Somewhere
distinctly ethereal Heavenly in fact

OVER THIS an incongruous restless clicking sound

Presently our camera swoops shaking us out of our reverie
sobering us up bringing us down to earth as it were

We swoop down lured by the continuing clicking sound

INT HOTEL BEDROOM - THAILAND - DAYBREAK

into a luxury hotel suite Curtains blow in balmy wind
Palm trees outside The sound of distant waves lapping
gently

A beautiful French woman in her mid 30’s sun-kissed sits in
bed writing emails on her Blackberry papers and work spread
out on her bed

She looks at her watch 800 am

She rolls over in bed and gently shakes the sleeping figure
next to her that of her boyfriend When she speaks it’s in
her native French (we see subtitles)

MARIE (IN FRENCH)
Cmon You need to get up

A reluctant groan

‘DIDIER (IN FRENCH)
(still asleep) -
Why

MARIE
You need to buy presents for your
children before we leave

Another reiuctant groan

DIDIER
Ill pick up something at the airport

MARIE
No no Not good enough Airport gifts
are rubbish

DIDIER
Please Let me sleep

DIDIER turns over buries his head under a pillow
DIDIER (cont’d)

Just another half hour

a

MARIE
Fine

MARIE pulls back her sheets Throws on a sarong

MARIE (contd)
If you won’t buy presents for your
children I will

‘Bzzzz —- her Blackberry rings with another message MARIE
turns and has a look She reads and smiles Begins to
reply

DIDIER
What’s going ON

MARIE
(typing message)
It seems the posters have gone up Are
all over Paris

DIDIER rolls his eyes MARIE finishes the e-mail

MARIE (cont’d)
Apparently you can’t move for them

DIDIER
If you’re going ask them to prepare
the bill will you And get them to
send up some breakfast

Rrriinngg’ MARIE’s phone starts ringing

DIDIER (cont’d)
And take this bloody thing with you

DIDIER throws MARIE’s ringing phone She catches it and
answers it as she goes

MARIE
Hello
INT HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY
MARIE steps out of the elevator speaking into her telephone

MARIE
So how many have you seen Really
Where have they put them

She walks through the lobby to reception She reaches
reception puts her hand over the receiver and speaks in
near-perfect English

MARIE (cont’d)
Good morning Could you prepare the
bill

( )

MARIE thinks then

MARIE (cont’d)
And could you send up some breakfast
Coffeeand fruit

MARIE rolls her eyes “I must be mad” then walks out of the
hotel doors continuing her conversation in French on the
phone

MARIE (contd)
The agency said there‘d be 120 across
the city How embarrassing It’s one
reason we wanted to be away

EXT STREETS -— CONTINUOUS

MARIE is hit by noise and heat Bustling streets teaming
with life She walks out into the streets and towards the
markets still speaking on the phone

MARIE
Listen quickly go through today’s
front pages with meI won’t be able
to go online before we leave

MARIE drifts through different market stalls and traders
Fruits vegetables household items leather goods and wood
carvings

MARIE smiles enjoying the activity Up ahead she sees a
stall with masks Wouldn’tone of those be perfect for the
little boy She turns to the TRADER points to the mask

MARIE (cont‘d)
How much

MARIE pays for the mask then takes it She drifts off
continuing to talk on the phonewalking through more stalls
looking for another present

Animals in cages Blaring music Cheap roadside hairdressers

MARIE (contd)
What about the local elections How
did Laponte do

Presently she finds a jewellers‘ stall MARIE stops Sees
the stall owner has a DAUGHTER who’s wearing a brightly-—
coloured bracelet

MARIE smiles points to the LITTLE GIRL’s bracelet

MARIE (cont’d)
You have more Like this

(

C

The STALL OWNER sees the bracelet Smiles Reaches into her
bag and produces a number of bracelets in different
colours

MARIE picks one identical to little GIRL’s

MARIE (cont’d)
Ill take this one

MARIE continues into the phone

MARIE (contd)
Well he’s got no one to blame for
that but himself You reap what you
sOw

The GIRL smiles MARIE takes out her purse pulls out some
money

MARIE (cont‘d)
How much -

But the STALL OWNER does not reply Simply stares
Transfixed MARIE continues on the phone

MARIE (contd)
Go on the record about immigration
like that you can’t expect the
Algerian vote

The STALL OWNER’s lips begin to tremble And points MARIE
turns to see what the fuss is about

Only then do we catch the oncoming roar and notice the

ground is shaking

MARIE’s eyes instinctively meet those of the little girl
The GIRL’s eyes

MARIE’s eyes

The GIRL’s eyes

MARIE’sS eyes

‘WWWWHHHHARAAARAAMMMMMMMMM’ the 30 £t high Tsunami wave

strikes them with the force of a hydrogen bomb destroying

everything in it’s path

MARIE is hurled fifty feet by the impact sucked under water

along with bits of market stalls cars other PEOPLE

INT HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The sound of screaming Pandemonium breaking out DIDIER sits
up in bed He rushes over to the window

( )

Horrified he looks out to see sheer devastation as the
Tsunami sweeps all in its path Bodies bobbing helplessly in
the water People screaming Buildings crumbling Cars
boats deckchairs in splinters DIDIER’s face falls

DIDIER
Marie
IN THE TSUNAMI

MARIE thrashes under water her eyes bulging desperate for
air Her mouth opens her thrashing becomes frantic

‘Hhuurggh’ she sticks her head above water gasping

urgently

She reaches out tries to hold onto a passing branch butthe
branch is ripped out of her hand and she is pulled under
again by the force of the wave

‘Hhuuuurrghh’ MARIE sticks her head above water again
gasping desperately Its critical now

But she’s sucked under again

MARIE’s struggle continues but it’s in vain Soon her
movements become weaker her eyes stare wildly as

MARIE begins to black out her brain starved of oxygen
Her struggle subsides as her head lolls to one side
MARIES eyes roll Her mouth gapes open

And as she drowns as her body ceases to struggle as the

last flicker of life leaves her

We CLOSE in on MARIE’s face

MARIE‘S POV

All sound goes silent Were in darkness A light in the
distance The sound of a gentle wind

It appears were in a large garden Overhanging branches or
foliage Colours gradually becoming visible

The light in the distance becomes closer and closer

Then suddenly

EXT STREETS - DAY

‘Wwhoooosh’ MARIE is pulled from the water The sound of
shouting voices Several pairs of hands tend to her

( )

(

Co

C

Her eyes flicker open barely conscious

Her RESCUERS frantically perform resuscitation on MARIE A
cacophony of noise Voices shouting instructions

But to no avail MARIE slips back into unconsciousness Her
head lolls lifelessly

We CLOSE in again on MARIE’s face

MARIE’S POV

The sound of a gentle wind We’re back in the beautiful
gardens The light has grown closer

For the first time we can make out amorphous shapes Moving
towards us And colours
EXT STREETS - DAY

“Wwwhoosshh” MARIE comes round again as RESCUERS
frantically pump her chest Slap her cheeks

Voices shouting in different languages imploring her to
“Stay with us” “Don’t go” “C’mon”

But it’s no use MARIE is beyond help Her head flops Dead

Slowly with sadness the RESCUERS give up get to their

feet They did their best but there are countless others
rn erying- out-They start tending—-to-other-cases- -

When suddenly

“Hhhurrrggh” MARIE bolts awake and violentiy vomits the
water in her lungs coughing and spluttering

e Her RESCUERS turn seeing MARIE is still alive and rush to
her assistance

MARIE is bewildered shell-shocked cannot understand what

has happened Overwhelmed she begins to weep as people wrap
her in towels give her water to drink

EXT STREETS - DAY

An hour later MARIE has found the strength to get to her
feet She walks unsteadily through flooded streets

A landscape of horror and devastation There is nothing left
of the market but debris

The air is filled with eerie sounds of suffering People
wailing in grief and shock or suffering pain

‘ ( )

MARIE stops and stares at where the jewellery stall was
where she bought the bracelet Splintered wood and the
occasional scattered bead are all that remain

No sign of the LITTLE GIRL

MARIE walks back towards the hotel which appears to have
suffered little or no damage She crosses the street when
suddenly a voice calls out

DIDIER
Marie

MARIE turns to see DIDIER running through the streets
towards her

DIDIER (cont’d)
Thank God

MARIE and DIDIER fall into an embrace hugging tightly

DIDIER (contd)
Thank God Thank God

INT TELEVISION STUDIO - DAY
MARIE looks straight into the camera reads from an autocue

MARIE
Good evening In tonights show the
Foreign Minister Guillaume Berni
defends“his postition after suggesting —-
that Romania had not yet done enough
to improve its human rights record

LATER the talk show is in full swing We pick up MARIE and
the FOREIGN MINISTER mid-combat

MINISTER
let me remind you I did what I did
on the advice of the Attorney General
The High Courts themselves ruled it
was in the interest of national
security

MARIE however is unable to concentrate-

Suddenly around MARIE in the TV studio all sound goes
silent

The FOREIGN MINISTER continues to talk but we hear nothing

MARIE’s POV
We’re in darkness A light in the distance The sound of a

gentle wind

( )

As before it appears we’re in a large garden Overhanging
branches or foliage

Colours gradually becoming visible
The light in the distance becomes closer and closer
Then suddenly

“WHOOOSH”

MARIE emerges again into the television studio as the
FOREIGN MINISTER continues to protest his innocence

MINISTER (cont’d)
--I did not accuse and have never
accused the Romanian Government of
failing in their Human Rights
obligations

In the production gallery DIDIER leans forward speaks into
the microphone

DIDIER
OK cut him off Let him have it
Marie

But rather than cut the MINISTER off MARIE appears to be
distracted has difficulty concentrating

MARIES POV

The—sound-of—a-gentle—wind-Werebackinthe- beautiful

gardens The light has grown closer

For the first time we can make out amorphous shapes Moving
towards us And colours

We CLOSE in again on MARIE’s face then suddenly

“WHOOOOSSHH” she is brought around by the sound of DIDIER’s
shouting voice in her earpiece

DIDIER (contd)
Marie did you hear me Cut him off

In the studio camera TECHNICIANS flinch hearing DIDIER’s
shouting in their earpieces

Even the MINISTER appears bemused
Then suddenly MARIE shakes herself out of it

MARIE
»but surely if you are in possession
of the facts and you deliberately
withhold information that constitutes
a lie and a serious breach of public
trust
( )

- Nervous looks around the studio

ad INT STUDIO - DRESSING-ROOM - AFTERWARDS

MARIE stares at her reflection in her dressing-room

her make-up DIDIER appears in the doorway

MARIE
Im sorry That was a disaster

DIDIER
It’s ali right No one will notice An
angry Finance Minister was a tough
welcome back

I think something happened to me when
that wave hit me

you to keep it between us

DIDIER

But do you think it’s possible that

Removing

DIDIER
That what

MARIE
-that I might actually have died
down there

DIDIER
DIED

MARIE
And came back again

DIDIER
What

MARIE

Only because I had this’vision’
When I went under When I blacked out
I went to this ‘place’

DIDIER
What did it look like’ Please don’t
tell me there was a bright light Or
some kind of garden

See That’s the bit that never rings
true to me I mean wheres the cut
off Close family Or friends And if
we‘re not in our physical form any
more how do we recognise one another

DIDIER smiles

DIDIER (cont’d)
No much more likely is that these
‘visions’ or ‘hallucinations’ will
have been a lack of oxygen to the
brain

DIDIER shrugs
DIDIER (cont‘d)
Or some kind of concussion That wave

will have hit you with some force You
hit your head

DIDIER looks at MARIE shrugs

u

DIDIER (contd)

All that near-death stuff is just
When we go

(snaps fingers)
we go And any version of the
afterlife we create for ourselves is
just a pathetic denial of the
fragility of life or a Christian
instrument of social control

DIDIER looks at MARIE

DIDIER (contd)
You banged your head

MARIE is about to protest then smiles

MARIE
You’re right Thanks

She kisses DIDIER good night
MARIE (cont‘d)
I’‘ll see you tomorrow

PRODUCER

OK was there or was ‘there not civil
unrest in the Sikh community after the
High Courts ruled that Sikhs are to be
forced to remove their turbans for
driving license photos

Two of the right wing newspapers claim
Sikhs were out in the streets burning
cars looting shops

(other newspapers)

deliberately created by elements
within nationalist parties in order to
cast negative suspicion on the Sikhs

As the debates continue DIDIER looks over the room at

A flicker of concern on DIDIER’s face She would normally be
leading these discussions

GEORGE gets into bed Beside him on a table is a small
CDradio player GEORGE lies down makes himself comfortable

then presses ‘Play’

Presently we hear the deep resonant voice of a British
actor Deep velvety mellifluous tones

ACTOR
“we might have gone about half a
mile when looking out to my
amazement I saw Peggotty burst from a
-hedge She jumped up onto the
carriage Not a single word did she
speak but tears were in her eyes She
squeezed me until the pressure on my
nose was extremely painful crammed
some pieces of cake into my pockets
and a purse which she put in my hand
then she got down and ran away
Presently I noticed one of her
buttons rolling around on the floor I
picked it up and treasured it as a
keepsake for a long time”

and he falls asleep

EXT CEMETERY - DAY

An inner-city cemetery in the middle of London In the
middle a small plain church

The sound of piped organ music and a smail number of singing
voices can be heard from inside

A large number of brightly-dressed SIKH MOURNERS arrive for
their ceremony which is obviously next up

They greet one another breath steaming in the cold and wait
their turn outside the church They shiver in the icy rain

Stamp their feet Check their watches

INT CHURCH - SAME TIME

Inside an almost empty nondenominational church the piped
music and singing comes to an end

Standing in the front row MARCUS holds the hymn book but is
unable to sing He stares ahead Rigid

Raised on a stand is his brothers COFFIN

A PRIEST steps up From his manner it’s clear the PRIEST has
never met JASON or his mother Standard text No frills

In and out in less than twenty minutes

The PRIEST can see the shivering SIKHS huddled in doorways
waiting outside An elderly SIKH who will conduct the next
service is waiting in the wings

The PRIEST puts his foot on the gas

PRIEST
Death is not final it is merely the
beginning gateway to an afterlife
that reflects our conduct here on
earth God in his infinite generosity
created heaven which is where Jason
is now Surrounded by all the angels
and saints Looking down at us

Among the congregation a few rows back we pick out the
SOCIAL WORKERS

Their eyes are on JACKIE the mother who’s head lolls She
sways from side to side supported by two equally stoned
fellow ADDICTS

MARCUS stands alone Neglected

PRIEST (contd)
And so we commend Jason’s body to
dust his soul already in God’s care

The PRIEST discreetly presses a hidden button With a great
grinding noise sliding doors open and an old worn-out
conveyor belt starts

JASON’s coffin starts with a jolt and slowly disappears
through the doors and into the furnace beyond

MARCUS stares Rooted to the spot

PRIEST (cont’d)
Jasons ashes will be made available
at the back of the church In the
meantime if you wouldn’t mind I’a
like you to leave through the front
door

The MOURNERS begin to filter out as in the back of the
church the SIKH GROUP begins to filter in grateful to get
out of the cold

SIKH WOMEN carry in a large picture of the deceased a
smiling elderly bearded MAN and prop it up on the altar

Hospital STAFF have tactfully discreetly given the FAMILY

The family hold the DYING WOMAN and each other as her final
journey begins

Presently the WOMAN’s breathing stops The struggle goes A
look of peace comes over her face

The FAMILY bursts into tears

Almost an envy (if it’s possible) in her face

pronounced dead then miraculously
survived

experienced were so strikingly
