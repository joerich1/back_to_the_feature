down into Penn Station stoic oblivious to the harried
commuters around him

Jackie starts shedding his winter garb He takes off his
hat and gives it to Miller He unzips his sports bag and
pulls out a pair of tennis shoes - kicking off his rubber

snow boots he slides on the loafers

MILLER
Oh CBS passed on the pilot

JACKIE

Jackie takes the mic from JJ Walker and puts on his show
face

JACKIE
Let’s hear it for the great JJ
Walker

Jackie sizes up the crowd He takes a deep breath and
lets it out slowly ending with a quick shudder We’11
come to recognize this as Jackie’s tic when he’s about to
erupt into comedy -- a fighter coming out of his corner

The chanting grows louder “EDDIE EDDIE”
Jackie takes the stage Grabs the mic
JACKIE
Give it up for JJ WALKER This guy

was on TV before there was

Jackie sizes up the crowd

Jackie turns around so he’s facing the Back Wall He
talks into the mic sotto voce - an internal dialogue

JACKIE TO HIMSELF
Maybe I shouldn’t do any marriage

jokes Everyone’s is a good mood

They just saw Brett Fucking
Butler they’re happy I can’t
crush their world with bleak shit
about marriage Keep it light

Jackie turns around and faces the audience

JACKIE

life from your soul until there’s
nothing left but one giant
festering sore No really I’ma
big fan of marriage Hicksville

get a little jealous but the

carpet shit on the floor maybe
chew up a shoe or two My third
wife did all those things But
then she went and did what all
wives do -- she got a lawyer
A dog will never do that A dog
will never go out and get a
lawyer And here’s another thing
a dog will never do When a dog
dies it will not be resurrected
25 years later on “Nostalgia
Night” Now I’m not suggesting

kind of dog-- 8

Jackie is interrupted by a HECKLER seated in front with
his BLONDE GIRLFRIEND

HECKLER

(shouting)
Enough of this dog shit Come on
do Eddie

JACKIE
Not now pal I’m working out some
new stuff here

HECKLER
Yeah no I didn’t pay to hear new
material I paid to see “Eddie”

As before Jackie turns his back to the audience and
speaks into the mic sotto voce - Internal dialogue

JACKIE TO HIMSELF

Oh Christ a heckler This must

GoPro Camera on a professional GoPro Steadi-Stick

HECKLER

weakness

Jackie tries to pull his mic out of Heckler’s hands

JACKIE
Don’t touch the mic

HECKLER
(into the camera)
This is Archie Severin challenging
Jackie Burke to a comic-face-off

JACKIE

against the Heckler’s head and face

HECKLER

JACKIE POUNDS THE HECKLER WITH THE MIC -

Blood spurts from the Heckler’s nose Jackie rips the mic
out of the Hecklers hands and pushes him over the table
onto his girlfriend who screams

Jackie grabs the Go Pro and speaks into it in the cadence
of his stand-up

JACKIE

And if you do get a dog don’t
take it to a comedy club

(turns to audience)
I see my time is up Thank you

your waitresses and be careful

blood on your way out GOOD NIGHT

The audience is in shock but a few shout their approval
Jackie crosses to Miller and rushes out with her

The video stops

INT COURTROOM - DAY

Jackie’s Attorney stands before the JUDGE Judith
Mansfield showing her the video on the I-Pad The
Prosecutor stands beside him also watching

JACKIE’S ATTORNEY
Your Honor as you can clearly
see Mr Severin grabbed Mr
Burkowitz first Mr Burkowitz
warned Mr Severin several times
to desist and he refused

Jackie sits at the defense table Miller sits behind him
The “victim” (Severin) with a bandage over his nose and
bruised eye sits behind the Prosecutor’s table

JUDGE MANSFIELD
Any objection to probation

DISTRICT ATTORNEY
With a strong Public Apology and
substantial Community Service

Nods to her Clerk Attorneys return to their clients
Jackie’s attorney gives him a “we won” thumbs up

COURT CLERK
Will the defendant please rise

Jackie stands

JUDGE MANSFIELD
Jonathan Burkowitz the court
understands there are mitigating
circumstances but nothing excuses
your retaliation It is in the
judgement of the court that you
will serve 100 hours of community
service attend 10 anger
management sessions and make an
allocution and apology Do you
understand Mr Burkowitz

JACKIE
Yes Your Honor

JUDGE MANSFIELD
And in accordance with the
agreement are you prepared to
change your plea from ‘not guilty’
to ‘guilty’

Jackie looks at his Attorney who nods
JACKIE
Yes Your Honor
The Attorney hands Jackie a sheet of paper Jackie reads
JACKIE (CONT’D)
I admit to assault and battery on
Mr Severin I recognize that I
acted in a weak and violent
manner and I will aggressively
take steps to ensure that it will
never happen again
Jackie glances over at the Heckler who smiles smugly
JACKIE (CONT’D)
I also apologize to the court and
to my fans
JUDGE MANSFIELD
Do you have something to say to
Mr Severin
JACKIE
(reluctantly)
I’m sorry
Severin leans across the railing and whispers to the DA
as if to say “that’s not good enough” The DA turns and
addresses the judge
DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Excuse me your Honor but I think
the defendant can do a little
better than that Mr Severin
could have suffered brain damage
JUDGE MANSFIELD
Mr Burkowitz you want to try
that again
Jackie looks over to Severin - who has a shit-eating
grin as if to say “I win asshole”
Jackie takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly
JACKIE
No
DISTRICT ATTORNEYJUDGE MANSFIELD
No

Miller covers her face She knows what’s coming

JACKIE
No You see your Honor there’s
no way Mr Severin could have
suffered brain damage because
according to the law as I
understand it it has not been
proven in this courtroom that Mr
Severin in fact has a brain

Shock and laughter from COURTROOM SPECTATORS

Too late

JUDGE MANSFIELD
Careful Mr Burkowitz

Miller covers her face

JACKIE
I mean as soon as the guy opened
his mouth it was like Gorillas in
the Mist - Look at him - You could
tell by his face You know Judge
the look like Donald Trump fucked
Alfred E Newman after a night of
snorting thalidomide

More laughter The Judge pounds her gavel for order

SEVERIN
(to DA)
Can he say that to me

JACKIE
Look at him right now struggling
to understand what I’m saying

JUDGE MANSFIELD
Stop right now I’m warning you--

JACKIE
This is more than just about me
Judge I think humanity’s fate is
in your hands Remember he was
with a female that night What if
they breed

Spectators laugh and cheer “You tell’em Jackie” The
Judge pounds her gavel Prosecutor starts shouting
Severin is on his feet shouting

question Can you imagine how
fucking painful my life would be
if I had to act like an audience
with all my comics “You laughed
more at his joke than ya did at
mine” “You think he’s funny he’s
not funny” So I don’t react to
anyone and everyone feels equal

21 EXT THE BOWERY MISSION - THANKSGIVING DAY 21

A sign above the door “He that cometh to me shall never
hunger” Camera tracks down a long line of HOMELESS
PEOPLE mostly men stretching down the sidewalk

JACKIE (VO)
Growing up my family observed all
the Thanksgiving traditions My
favorite was my Uncle Moshit
telling the Thanksgiving Story

INT THE BOWERY MISSION - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The cramped space is filled with hungry vets hookers
trannies etcsome still shivering from the cold

Jackie wearing a black hair net underneath a sanitary
hat is dishing out food While dishing out food he
speaks into a microphone on a stand

JACKIE
Uncle Moshit told me that before
the first Thanksgiving Pilgrims
thought turkeys were sex objects
They couldn’t fly and “gobble
gobble” was Puritan for “blowjob”
When the Indians showed up - right
after the Macy’s Parade - they
brought turkeys all trussed up
The Pilgrims were pissed They
were like “They’re eating our fuck
birds” But being Puritans they
didn’t want to be rude And it
turned out turkeys tasted better
than going down on their wives

Beyond the line of homeless Jackie can’t help notice -

HARMONY refilling ice tea and cups of coffee - laughs at
Jackie’s routine along with the crowd

JACKIE
So the Puritans stopped fucking
the turkeys and started fucking
the Indians instead And that’s
how we stole their country and
made the turkey our national bird

Scattered applause and laughs Jackie’s eye follows
Harmony across the room filling the coffee cups of two
vets as she talks to them She’s full of energy Everyone
seems to like her Including Jackie

INT THE BOWERY MISSION - LATER THAT DAY

Wide Shot Volunteers are cleaning up Jackie is holdin g
his paperwork We see him ask one of the VOLUNTEERS where
the supervisor is The Volunteer points upstairs

Jackie walks up a flight of stairs to the chapel office
in the balcony featuring a stained glass window

INT CHAPEL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The office’s door is ajar Jackie pauses when he hears an
one sided argument from inside the office

HARMONY (0OS)

celebrate Brittany and Frankie’s

wedding

Jackie slips into his persona with great ease He loves a
good crowd

Big laughs Harmony is enjoying him

He pauses You can see him thinking

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Flo thank you and Jimmy for
inviting me to this beautiful
occasion And all the other family
members - many of whom I thought
were dead Most of whom hoped I
was dead

FLO
You better not be laughing
JAMES

JACKIE

Familyfamily

So is James

Is he going

sentimental on us James knows he’s not murmuring

Audience laughs James winces

it

JAMES
Oh shit

JACKIE
No one can fuck you up like
family

JACKIE (CONT’D)
I had a tragic childhood My
father molested my little brother
and the bastard never touched me
I mean look at Jimmy and look at
me - his growth stunted but I
woulda changed places anytime Do
you know what it’s like growing up
feeling unwanted Knowing your
father doesn’t find you attractive
enough to fondle Would it have
been so terrible for him to play
with my dick a littleI don’t
know Frankie very well but I hope
she’s a better parent than ours
and violates all their children
Not just the cute ones Meeskites
need love too

Flo fumes Harmony loves

Many of the guests are shocked

Flo wants

to kill but Brittany Frankie

friends love it

JACKIE (CONT’D)

I know we’re supposed to pretend
that there’s nothing unusual about
this event -- just another middle
class Jewish wedding

(sarcastic)
Right

(then)
So let me address the eight
hundred pound gorilla in the room

(beat)
That would be Flo

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Flo it’s okay It is just
another middle class Jewish
wedding And just like all Jewish
marriages once the ceremony is
over there will be no blow jobs
Ever But somehow I don’t think
that’s going to be a problem here

Let me be serious for just one
moment If we’re honest we
all have to admit that Frankie
isn’t what we wanted as a mate for
our Brittany

Gasp from the Crowd

JACKIE (CONT’D)
It’s an abomination Really
Brittany a shiksa

Laughter and relief

JACKIE (CONT’D)
Now before the couple cuts the
giant vagina cake --
(aside)
Save me some vulva

that they’re registered at Sak’s

Mild audience laughter May nods rolling her eyes -
she’s heard that one many times before She leans into
her microphone

MAY
And your movies -- oh wait you
don’t have any movies

Big laughs from the audience

D’ ANGELO
All joking aside
MAY
What jokes
D’ ANGELO

You truly are one of the greatest
talents in this business What can
say You’re barely a living
legend

Laughs Jackie recognizes his own joke His impulses take
overBefore D’Angelo can say another word Jackie
appears and pushes him hard out of the way -- essentially
highjacking the podium and the fourth spot

JACKIE
That’s enough Dick

(to audience)
Wake up people The “Whatever-

turns to May

JACKIE
May Oh May We’ve heard a lot
about your many accomplishments
tonight but no one’s really
talked about how tough it was for
you starting out Today you can
get the part just by blowing the
director God when I think of the
things you had to do

up

JACKIE
Whatever you did worked because
you played some of the most iconic
roles in the history of film And
me Jackie Burke was with you all
the way When you played the
title role in “The Battleship
Potemkin” I was one of the
sailors you took on You remember
me - I came in the porthole

May included

JACKIE
Then we were re-united in “Wizard
of Oz” Does this sound familiar
(sings high pitched
Munchkin voice)
Ding dong the witch is deadAnd
even though we are inbredYou
gave a hundred munchkins head

Laughs are building May coughs laughing Drinks water 57

JACKIE
And then who could ever forget
when we were together in the
original “Poseidon Adventure” You
as the Poseidon Me as a cabin
boy Remember my audition

Jackie puts his hand on the front top of his head
simulating hair and flicks his tongue rapidly

MAY
(through laughter)
Yes And you got the part

Applause and laughter Audience is loving Jackie

JACKIE
And I learned how to make the
Poseidon capsize

The Audience is eating it up May is convulsed

JACKIE
Yes May O’Connor you chewed a
lot of scenery in your timeand
apparently swallowed

MAY
Swallowed

JACKIE
In all seriousness May Connor is
not only the greatest actress of
our generation - and okay the
several generations preceding this
one -- she’s a great sport Thanks
to May we’re raising a ton of
money tonight for Meals on Wheels
(Jackie leads

Applause)
Wait “May””a ton””meals on
wheels”Add in an Oscar and

fucking more young boys than the

entire Los Angeles Archdiocese and

youve got May’s whole biography
May laughing hard and wheezing now

MAY
Jackie Stop

Jackie puts an affectionate hand on May’s shoulder The
crowd applauds wildly 57

May looks like she’s laughing out of control - but is
also writhing in her chair as if something might be
wrong Jackie just goes with it

JACKIE
Seriously May An orgasm Now

Her body trembles She motions for him to stop Suddenly
May slumps over Her head hits the table hard right in
front of her mic Everyone gasps leaping to their feet

Richard Belzer and others hurry to help her No one is
paying attention to Jackie The dais guests gather around
May Jackie is dazed still in his comic high mode
JACKIE
Its OK May don’t worry
D’Angelo’s not coming back
Richard Belzer pulls the mic away from Jackie to yell

RICHARD BELZER
Is there a doctor in the house

But May is gone Her body surrounded by crying people

As EMT workers move onto the dais Jackie is pushed back
and bumps into D’Angelo

D’ ANGELO
Wow You killed
JACKIE
I didn’t even get to my best
stuff

behind the monitor

JACKIE
Right now our two anthropology
majors from Camel Toe U are
basting you with molasses When
they’re done all you have to do
is lay down in this geese pen and
we’1ll release these hungry birds

Reveal a GEESE PEN full of squawking geese Mark lays
down A small picket fence separates him from the birds

JACKIE
Don’t forget Mark If you last two
minutes with the geese you’ll win
this new hybrid car anda
Carribbean vacation for you and

kid - around three - has no idea what’s happening

tight to those butter balls as I
release the angry birds

Jackie pulls a lever and a wall in the pen lifts up The
audience cheers as the geese begin pecking at Mark’s
skin At first it tickles The audience is laughing

JACKIE
Hang in there Mark You’re halfway
home

become more aggressive The contestant is clearly
bleeding from numerous cuts He squeals in pain

In the front row his children are scared Jackie sees

the disgust he feels He looks over to Miller Everyone
around her is cheering but she knows Jackie so well

MARK
AHHHAHHH UNCLE UNCLE

The cheering suddenly stops as Mark leaps out of the pen
He is covered in hay brown sugar and splotches of blood
His family is horrified Jackie puts his arms around

Mark along with a towel and robe and looks into camera

JACKIE

“Say Uncle” will be right back
But as for me I’d rather have
Stevie Wonder shave my testicles
with a butcher knife than be part
of a this reality shit So this is
Jackie Burke saying “Uncle” and
Riot TV can go fuck itself 71

disbelief As he crosses Carol Jackie says
