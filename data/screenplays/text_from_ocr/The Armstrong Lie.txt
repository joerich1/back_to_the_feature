B-Roll Images of parade

NARRATOR In 2009 set out to make a film about Lance Armstrong’s
comeback year it seemed like a great ride retired champion with a
contentious past comes back to cycling to show them all Then the Lance
doping scandal erupted and had to put the film aside When picked the
film back up faced the same question that haunted me in 2009 Why did he
come back He’d won the Tour de France seven times wondered what
had been witness to in 2009 and what did it mean now the truth about Lance
was known In making my new film all roads seemed to lead back to the
past

B-Roll Lance on his bike

LANCE viewed my battle with cancer as an athletic competition But in
that you either win or you lose And you lose or if you lose you die So
took that perspective which is a little dark and and put it into everything
Ive done since then like to win but more than anything ju- cant stand
the idea of losing because to me that equals death

REPORTER 1 And look at this Armstrong accelerating once again and
theres a gap now starting to appear between Lance Armstrong and Marco
Pantani

REPORTER 2 Well never thought I’d see the day when Lance Armstrong
would blow away the man we’ve always referred to as the finest climber
weve ever seen in the current peloton of cycling

REPORTER 2 But there’s one matter that stayed on Armstrongs tail--
allegations he’s used banned performance enhancers

REPORTER Few people in sport divide public opinion quite like Lance
Armstrong To millions he is a source of inspiration but to some his
incredible tale is just that incredible Hard to believe

NARRATOR Yet so many wanted to believe Wherever Lance went he
moved the needle More fans more money for sponsors and promoters
Even so the organization that ran the Tour de France was reluctant to invite
him back Just ten months before the race the comeback was in jeopardy

LANCE The story is refuse-
JOHAN BRUYNEEL The Tour doesn’t want him

LANCE Entry into The Tour de France for no reason This guys coming
back Hes never been caught prosecuted busted for anything Hes coming
back with the most legitimate credible program that there is and they wont
let him in the marquee event think that the media would fucking crush it

JOHAN BRYUNEEL Well they dont let him ride mean hes going to take
so so much attention away from the Tour de France to other events that
they have to let him in

Armstrong

UNKNOWN 1 Yep the Armstrong Lie

NARRATOR Long before Oprah the Armstrong Lie article offered proof that
Lances first Tour win had not been clean Through clever detective work
the author discovered that many of Armstrongs urine samples from 1999
contained a doping drug called EPO

LANCE If you consider my situation a guy who comes back from arguably
you know a death sentence why would then enter into a sport and dope
myself up and risk my life again Thats crazy would never do that That
that thats no No way

NARRATOR It was a bold claim considering how many riders around him
had been busted And even after Lances seven tour wins pro-cycling
continued to suffer from doping scandals

STEVE MADDEN There are a lot of us who wanted this to be a clean sport
and a and a clean effort and a clean victory but theres just too much swirl
around it constantly

DAN COYLE Shortly after Armstrong retired there was this huge huge bust
called operation Puerto which in which most of his rivals got popped

COYLE You know if it was the NBA All Star game it wouldve been every
player on both teams essentially busted for doping except that one guy who
just retired

NARRATOR Throughout Lances tour wins all but one of the cyclists who
finished on the podium with Armstrong were implicated in doping scandals

LANCE And finally the last thing Ill say for the people that dont believe in
cycling the cynics and the skeptics Im sorry for you Im sorry you cant
dream big and Im sorry you dont believe in miracles

COYLE After winning in 2005 what better moment to walk away What
better moment to stay away Why couldnt he have just said thank you had
a nice career and now its over Thank you But thats not in him And that
urge to crush that urge to push back that urge to dominate not just to be

content with winning but that urge to dominate is what ended up bringing
him down

NARRATOR Lance tried to dominate my film too He had lied to me
straight to my face all throughout 2009 When the truth came out told him
he owed me an explanation on camera Whether he wanted to try to make
things right or whether he still wanted to influence my story he agreed to sit
down one more time

ALEX You vehemently defended your reputation Do you feel in retrospect
that you were protecting that too assiduously mean that the lie had
become too big Did it get out of control for you

LANCE Yeah thats the biggest regret of my life Um you know I’m a Ima
fighter grew up a fighter was a fighter on the bike was a fighter off the
bike and if if you run the race was competitive and was fighting Uh
well forgot to turn that get off the bike and whether thats in a press
conference whether its in a team setting whether its in a personal
relationship continued to fight And wanted to defend myself and
wanted to defend the sport the team my foundation was defending all of
these things and was prepared to say anything

Slow Pan Long Lance’s book t’s Not About the Bike

DAN COYLE The gift that he has that gets overlooked is his gift as a
storyteller his gift as a manager of his own story line

COYLE A guy at deaths door comes back to win the toughest event on the
planet The story brought more money brought more attention brought
more sponsorship brought more inspiration Lance became this
international cultural icon and he had to keep the story going He couldve
ridden around the world to raise money for cancer there were a lot of things
he couldve done But the best story is to go back to the Tour

LANCE By racing the bicycle all over the world beginning in Australia
ending in France uh it is the best way uh to promote this initiative It’s the
best way to get the word out was just backstage with

COYLE He understood the power of that story and he used it

LANCE The disease testicular cancer travels up a young mans body so
next stop is the abdomen next stop is the lungs and and the last stop is
the brain My dumb ass just ignored symptoms obvious glaring dirty
symptoms for a long time and and uh it traveled all the way up

INTERVIEWER Lemon
LANCE Good sized lemon

NARRATOR In 1996 Lance had the cancerous testicle removed and flew to
Indiana University for an experimental treatment The doctors there thought
Lances chances of survival were less than 50 Lance underwent brain
surgery to remove cancerous legions then began a special chemotherapy
program that would not scar his lungs The immediate side effects would be
brutal but if he survived the treatment would protect his career

LANCE Whatever do in cycling or whatever do in the Tour de France or
whatever do in training Ill never suffer like did then

Images of Lance with cancer scar

LANCE That initial surgery to remove that primary tumor in the testicle was
a big surgery a big cut mean the cut was probably six inches long right up
at the waist and very physically painful so got on the bike and just sort of
gently road around my neighborhood That was a that was a big day for me
And didnt do anything went half a mile and did it in tennis shoes and
did it on the mountain bike but was on the bike was peddling the bike
was um all the things and feelings that are associated with that the wind in
the hair um um that initial sense of freedom that a bicycle gives a child
kids love bikes because its the first time in their life theyre free Its the first
time when theyre not in their moms car theyre not in moms living room
theyre not in moms backyard They get on the bike they go down they take
a right they take a left Nobody sees them Theyre completely free

Music montage

NARRATOR Lance Armstrong grew up in Plano Texas raised by a young
mother who worked as a receptionist He never met his father

COYLE He comes out of Plano Texas and he comes out angry He comes
out ready to take on the world with his mom at his side and needing no one
else

LANCE My mom she doesnt really have that much money so mean
could probably get money from somebody but dont want to borrow money
so theres pressure to make the money

yellow jersey for two full weeks now

JONATHAN VAUGHTERS It was an American team bringing an American
captain to the Tour de France and finishing you know potentially on the
podium That was unprecedented

ANNOUNCER And theres no doubt now who will win the Tour de France

GEORGE HINCAPIE We hoped maybe to get a podium or a top ten so to
win was kind of beyond our comprehension

NARRATOR The power of the story was growing everyday but so were the
suspicions amongst seasoned observers that it may have been too good to
be true

DAVID WALSH In 1999 the Tour de France organizers were desperate for
what they called a tour of renewal where they could renew the publics faith
in their race Youve got to go back to 1998 when Lance was just about
coming back into racing after his cancer recovery We have this
extraordinary Tour de France where the world number one team at the time
Festina had their masseur traveling to the race and he was stopped by
French customs and they found a huge cargo of drugs inside The police
then came and investigated other teams and pretty much wherever they
looked they found drugs So that was 1998 A year later Lance Armstrong
comes back He was sensational And everybody who was at that race - in
terms of the journalists - when Lance made his big attack in the mountains to
ces Sestriére was in the press room that day saw the reaction People
were laughing incredulous They didnt believe this because here we had a
guy who had come back from cancer supposedly riding the race clean
riding more effortlessly with greater power at a greater speed than all the
Tours that had gone before So it just didnt make sense

DAN COYLE We have to remember this is a guy who is not thought of as
somebody who could potentially win the Tour de France He had always
been strong in those short races but never over the long haul and he had
never been a climber

LANCE You know whenever you start the tour they make you fill out these
forms you know How many tours have you done How many have you
completed And remember in ‘99 had to write down four and one
Thinking thats not a great record

DAVID WALSH Lance Armstrong winning at one level created a problem
because the organizers that actually said before the race we want this race
to be slower than the drug races of previous years To prove to the public

that these guys are now using less drugs but it was the fastest ever Tour
But on the other hand they had this winner who was the most romantic
figure that sport maybe had ever known

LANCE A cancer survivor overcoming the disease comes back and wins the
Tour yeah they were - they liked that

REED ALBERGOTTI With Lance Armstrong winning the Tour de France
that opened up this huge market in the US Oakley and Nike and Trek and
Bristol Meyers Squib mean you name it There was a long list of
companies that were just getting in line to sign deals with Lance Armstrong
because they knew who Lance was as a cancer survivor as a person and
an advocate for the cancer surviving community

BILL STRICKLAND When he first won in ‘99 that was the last time he was
just a bike racer and after that he became a celebrity That celebrity is what
gave him such immense power

DAN COYLE This is not a story about doping It’s a story about power And
Lance got the power in ‘99 and the story became hanging onto that power

NARRATOR Even in 1999 Lance came close to getting caught when
steroids showed up in a urine test

Archival Footage LANCE Turns out was using some eh cream for what
we call a saddle sore and and it was eh it was something that we all use —
mean like a cortisone cream that you use for for a crash or for or for a boil
or any sort of skin infection and and eh eh the traces were so small
mean these- they were ridiculous and and eh

LANCE was always on my heels right away from 99 ummand of
course there were plenty of supporters and cheerleaders in the press

Archival Footage REPORTER Lance Armstrong forced once again to
defend himself there which is becoming a depressingly familiar sight on this
tour but tonight he has some very high level help because the UCI the
world governing body of cycling have just released this press communiqué
It goes against all their commitment to medical secrecy they say but they
want to do it to clarify this situation and stop it getting further out of hand
They confirmed that the rider used an ointment and they give the brand
name and that he also offered them a medical prescription before his test

LANCE It showed up in the test and Verbruggen just said Look you gotta
give us a reason for this being in your system so the guys scoured the
internet looking for this particular type of cortisone and we found one that
was uh that was indeed a cream and we said it was for saddle sores

ALEX GIBNEY Now when you say that Verbruggen came to you do you
mean he came to you like give us some excuse so that we dont have to
make an issue of this

ALEX GIBNEY Johan told me that he did speak to Verbruggen about
Lance’s positive test Verbruggen the head of the UCI denies that the
conversation ever took place

hard work

Caption Universal-International News SPORTS Voice Ed Herlihy

ED HERLIHY The ninth day of the Tour de France world famous bike race
brings the greatest challenge yet the lofty hills of the Maritime Alps This is
the acid test of stamina and endurance

NARRATOR The Tour de France has always been a brutal event For a few
dollars from sponsors looking for human billboards working class riders are
willing to suffer An ascent in the mountains can mean climbing steep grades
for more than twenty miles Lifting a man and his bicycle up the rising road
demands a furious release of energy that is higher than any other animal on
earth except a hummingbird That inhuman suffering carves the body in
unnatural ways and leads riders to the search for doping methods that can
dull pain and push human limits

PHIL LIGGETT Theres always been a form of doping in any form of
endurance sport And in the Tour de France originally it was alcohol Youd
be passed a bottle of beer up by a monk on a mountaintop and youd drink it

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE
English subtitles

They enter a cafe shoving everyone aside and take anything red wine
champagne beer

Even water if theres nothing better

PHIL LIGGETT And then of course the clever doctors have come on
board saying to athletes We can prepare you properly for the Tour Not
just give you dope but well tell you the correct diet how to train and then
coup de gras is to give you the the needle of EPO and youre going to be
ten percent better than your rival That is enormous and that became
apparent in the 1990s Firstly with the Italians

Ferrara Italy

NARRATOR This ancient walled city in Northern Italy became a center for a
group of doctors determined to find a way to boost cycling performance The
most notorious of these was Lance Armstrongs trainer Michele Ferrari

FRANKIE ANDREU He was a doctor that gave a training program a full
medical program and would boost your career and make you into you
know the king of the road He had a very bad reputation as being a doctor
that could set people up with a doping program

DAN COYLE If you took all the rumors and the smoke and the stories of the
dark side of cycling and condensed them into one human being that would
be Michele Ferrari But he turns out to be a very delightful communicative
expressive SCIENTIST - thats the bit that gets lost a little bit think he
comes across as sort of a cloak and dagger enabler when in fact his whole
story his core interests the way he educated himself is essentially scientific

NARRATOR Michele Ferrari was obsessed with pushing the limits of human
athletic performance If cyclists saw themselves as biological racing
machines Ferrari was one of the worlds greatest mechanics

MICHELE FERRARI This is one of the first eh relationship with Lance
Probably he was already with cancer but nobody knew

NARRATOR Surprisingly in 2009 Lance and his team gave me permission
to talk to Ferrari a man who rarely gave interviews to outsiders

ALEX GIBNEY So in 95 you saw Lance and you thought he has enormous
potential

MICHELE FERRARI He was able to develop a lot of power - absolute power
- a lot of watts His potential was impressive His engine - we can say his
heart his lungs - is big is huge

NARRATOR After Lance survived cancer Ferrari found a way to turn his
weakness into strength

FERRARI He was definitely lighter He lose a lot of muscles - the whole
body upper and also in the legs He lose a lot of power in terms of strength

NARRATOR To make up for the loss of strength Ferrari had Lance shift to
a lower gear and pedal faster

DAN COYLE So he essentially was shifting the load from the muscles to
the heart and the lungs and the blood And if you can have the aerobic
engine to sustain a higher cadence you can go farther faster longer

NARRATOR Ferrari also included a secret ingredient drugs to boost
oxygen in the blood that had a special impact with the new cadence

Archival Footage ANNOUNCER And this unbelievable cadence that hes
adopted since he survived testicular cancer is what has allowed him to
become one of the best climbers in the world

FERRARI Utilizing a higher cadence The beginning we had to do this
choice and then because this choice paid in term of results we continued

DAN COYLE Ferrari’s remarkably sort of unromantic and remember one
particular conversation we had just finished a training ride And said Am
watching sort of the the limits of human potential here Is that that what Im
seeing And Ferrari almost laughed He said Were nowhere near the
limit No there are other ways to push the limits

GEORGE HINCAPIE Amongst the 200 guys doing the Tour de France at
that point theyre like Oh youre working with Ferrari oh okay respect He
knew that everybody was doping and he was like Look you cant do this
stuff on your own You guys arent doctors You have no idea what all this
stuff is so heres what Im going to do You can still dope a little bit Ill Ill Ill
tell you what to do Umm the minimal amount of doping the maximum
amount of training nutrition lifestyle everything that goes into making you a
good cyclist will help you with And doping was just a small piece of that

NARRATOR Ferrari was careful about doping for another reason he
wanted to avoid detection He had sources inside anti-doping labs who kept
him updated on the latest tests and Ferrari’s whole program was cloaked in
secrecy

BETSY ANDREU In March 1999 Lance said I gotta go see Michele
have to do some testing We met Michele Ferrari Lances doctor who
traveled in a camper van in the parking lot outside of Milano off the
highway by a hotel gas station Eh dont know about you but dont see
my doctor that way

LANCE Its best that you use the most knowledgeable people Uh
regardless of eh of eh their reputation Its it’s eh a great mind in cycling
and and somebody that consider and my team considers to be uh an
honest man and a fair man

DAVID WALSH The guy was a liar and a cheat Not only did he dope but
he doped with the best expertise available Dr Ferrari provides that And he
doped in the most professional efficient way perhaps in the history of sport

Archival Footage — Press Conference DAVID WALSH What kind of
message do you think your working relationship with Michele Ferrari sends
out to the general sporting public

LANCE Well David its its Im glad you showed up finally its good to see
you finally here Umm good question Uh Again think that people are
not stupid People will look at the facts They will say okay heres Lance
Armstrong heres a relationship - is that questionable Perhaps But people
are smart Do they say has Lance Armstrong ever tested positive No Has
Lance Armstrong been tested A lot

ALEX GIBNEY Is it fairly easy to prepare for a test Like does it dissipate
in your system really quickly

EPO Yes he will

LANCE My defense was that Ive passed every control youve given me and
thats true The samples that were given were clean

ALEX GIBNEY But you never ever stopped there You always went one
step further

LANCE Oh no Alex mean cant I would have gone mean if David
Walsh wanted to put on boxing gloves would have done it right there Lets

go

Archival Footage DAVID WALSH You present yourself as the cleanest of
clean riders

LANCE And have the proof which you refuse to believe

DAVID WALSH Just let me finish the question You present yourself as the
cleanest of clean riders and yet you associate with somebody whose
reputation is incredibly tarnished and that person is going to go on trial in two
months time Would you not think that it would be in the interest of cycling for
you to suspend your relationship with Michele Ferrari until he has answered
the charges of which he is accused

LANCE You have a point Its my choice view him as innocent Hes a
clean man in my opinion Let there be a trial

NARRATOR There was a trial The star witness was an Italian cyclist
Filippo Simeoni

English subtitles FILIPPO SIMEONI He told me very clearly that to prepare
for a big race needed to take certain substances in particular EPO had
some journals confiscated where meticulously documented my interactions
with Ferrari

NARRATOR In October 2004 the Italian court convicted Dr Ferrari of
sporting fraud forcing Armstrong to publically end their relationship
However Ferrari’s conviction would be overturned two years later

MICHELE FERRARI In the end was absolved and probably we need a
movie to explain the whole story with with Simeoni but but umm according
or uh in relationship with in EPO okay there’s there a generation of
riders utilized that drug In competition that’s historic true

NARRATOR “EPO” or synthetic EPO stimulates the production of red
blood cells which transmit oxygen to the muscles Originally developed to
treat anemia cyclists began using it in the 1990s to boost performance and
recovery

body to deliver more oxygen from your lungs to your muscles so that
burning sensation that fatigue where you cant go any further it just
happens later

LANCE Yeah it began in the late 80s and end of the early 90s and our
frustration really came to a head in 1995 but leading up to that you know
specifically 1994 was the world champion was wearing the world
champions jersey the rainbow striped jersey and competing clean and we
were just getting annihilated

Home Movie UKNOWN Lance goes to the Tour
LANCE Ho ho oh holy cow

LANCE There was a group of us Primarily living in Italy and we just said
we either have to play ball here or go home

ALEX GIBNEY Were you pissed off that you had to do it Or were you was
it just you had to do what you had to do in order to be able to compete

LANCE The latter LAUGHS Yeah maybe uh maybe Id approach the
decision differently today but at the time didnt lose sleep over it

VAUGHTERS One time I eh went into Lances room to borrow his laptop
and hes brushing his teeth in his boxer shorts and he decides to give
himself a shot of EPO right in front of me That was an attempt by him of just
saying you know Listen buddy youve stepped over the line Youre in the
club Theres no going back

Archival Footage LANCE ARMSTRONG Where is everybody (Laughs)

JONATHAN VAUGTHERS His perspective was Listen this doping has
been in place for a hundred years in this sport And came into this system
and this system was already in place And just have to play by the rules

GEORGE HINCAPIE You werent trying to beat the system you were trying
to be in the system You know nobody made me dope just knew that had
to dope to do the sport that loved to do

FRANKIE ANDREU was a good bike racer and then all of a sudden guys
who could only sprint were getting over big climbs in front of me and doing
things that they never could do before And was getting dropped and
struggling and so um you know lived with that for a while but after a while
I cracked So ended up taking EPO also And you know admitting to it
doesnt make it justifiable or or any better But it was something that was
pretty prevalent at the time

ALEX GIBNEY Now ‘99 um when you were on Lances team was there a

JOHNATHAN VAUGHTERS Going into ‘99 there are massive risks
regarding doping was really scared You could go to jail for having this
stuff

LANCE ARMSTRONG The big fear was basically getting caught holding
The Festina affair was not an entire team testing positive The Festina affair
was a soigneur crossing a border and a customs agent going Hang ona
second

DAN COYLE 1999 was the year they cracked the code It was the year they
figured out how to win the race They hit on a plan and it was really Lance
who hit on a plan They would hire a guy he was Lances gardener he was
also a mechanic They called him Motoman He had a fast red motorcycle
He was fearless

LANCE ARMSTRONG Motoman basically did the Tour de France ona
motorcycle and he would meet up with a staff member and you know just
do us a subtle handoff at some restaurant and then next thing you know it’s
back at the hotel and- and um the doctor would administer it

Archival Footage REPORTER A lot of people who watch our programs
have heard of your illness and see you winning now and think its nothing
short of a miracle Do you see it that way

LANCE ARMSTRONG Un it is a miracle

DAN COYLE At that time he had recently taken delivery of EPO from Moto
Man He was involved in all manner of doping

ALEX GIBNEY If they were doing this drug why didnt they get caught
DAN COYLE Well there was no test for EPO at the time

LANCE Those early years uh people they always say to me Why didnt
they do more Why didnt they do more They- they could not do any more
You couldnt find it

DAN COYLE In 2000 they developed a test for EPO So the smart guys
Ferrari being one of them went back to an older technology which was you
take out bags of blood before the race During the race you put them back
in

NARRATOR During the race the body in need of oxygen is thirsty for red
blood cells A transfusion boosts the number of red blood cells and unlike
EPO transfusions were almost impossible to detect Theyre still against the
rules but hard to stop unless inspectors can find the blood bags

STEVE MADDEN My initial reaction to this was how gross it was that like
you want to win this race so bad that you would take your blood in a bag put
it in a cooler with ice and beer and other stuff and then like eventually put it
back in

STEVE MADDEN On the other hand its like Look if this is what they
thought it took to win and that they also thought that everybody else was
doing it

ALEX GIBNEY Is that an argument you buy

STEVE MADDEN No dont buy it but uh but think that you know
when youre talking about this stuff there is definitely a moral relativism to
the whole thing

LANCE 2000 it was a time when they were trying to implement the test and
they didnt know exactly what was positive what was negative The science
wasnt ready yet My suspicion is that everybody used it at the Tour Michele
came to me and said You shouldnt use EPO at the Tour dont feel good
about that think theyre you know just theyre close to getting the test
right He knew when the test was going to be ready He said Its not worth
the risk Lets let’s just do one transfusion We all agreed and so we did
one transfusion in the middle of the Tour But the Tour was won before
The Tour was won on Hautacam in 2000 when won by 4 minutes That was
pre-transfusion But he made that call and we all questioned that call

ALEX GIBNEY Because you thought it wasnt going to be enough
LA thought it was - thought that was not going to be enough

DAN COYLE Each year the bar got nudged a little higher The innovation
demands grew You had to keep up with the Joneses or fall behind It
became this game of hide and seek and the best place to hide sometimes is
plain sight and thats what they chose to do in 2004 They faked a
mechanical breakdown pulled the bus over to the side of the road and
administered blood bags to the entire team in front of everybody in front of
the police in front of the fans

GEORGE HINCAPIE It struck me as odd but it made sense mean were
just - were going to do it eventually so might as well knock it out on the bus
while - before we got to the hotel and you know be done with it

DAN COYLE When everyone cheats then it becomes hugely distorted It
becomes a different contest a contest of whos got the best doctor whos
got the most money whos got the biggest risk tolerance And the guy who
was that guy for this era was Lance Thats where it becomes a game of
power When you can say Im signing up Ferrari to be my exclusive doctor
when you can say Im going to use a private jet to travel around to evade
detection

LANCE Life for me at the time was moving fast mean look at 2005
was - had won seven Tours in a row was engaged to a beautiful rock
star was - but that all just felt normal to me certainly was very confident
that would never be caught

DAN COYLE Armstrong rather enjoyed this think he embraced it think
he had the attitude If youre going to cheat you dont cheat halfway you
cheat all the way You bring everything”

JONATHAN VAUGHTERS If its training its 100 percent If its equipment
its 100 percent If its doping its 100 percent So once he crossed that line
and once hed overcome his moral dilemma it was two feet in for him

STEVE MADDEN Don’t bring a knife to a gunfight think he he thought
that the Tour de France was a gunfight and why show up with a knife if
everyone else has guns

DAN COYLE When you take that killer mentality and put it in a sport where
there are no regulations where there are no rules and people are
transfusing bags of blood and taking all kinds of drugs and using their power
to avoid being detected thats where it stops being sport and starts being
something much darker

ALEX GIBNEY Why did you come back in 2009 Did you think this was an
opportunity to actually convince people that you had never doped

LANCE - dont think so dont think they were ever going to shut their
mouths but did want to - did intend to go back and win and do it clean

ALEX GIBNEY Did you have any concern about going back and opening up
some of the questions that had been raised in the past

LANCE Of course

NARRATOR So Lance knew the risk he was taking in coming back With
new doping controls in place in 2009 maybe he thought he had a chance to
ride clean and win thought that his comeback might have been a way of
proving to his critics and to himself that it didn’t matter if he had doped in the
past

LANCE You know know what did and didnt do so therefore sleep at
night Um And I’m one of the greatest riders of all time If you look at the
books and you look at the records he won seven Tours in a period where
everybody thought where everybody was dirty If win again theyre not
going to - they cant say that They cannot Well you can but thered be a
few dickheads whod say that trust me but no way

Archival Footage PAUL KIMMAGE Lance um youve spoken recently
about return of Ivan Basso and Floyd Landis um after their suspensions
and that they should be welcomed back What is it about these dopers that

Archival Footage LANCE Excuse me What is your name again

KIMMAGE My name is Paul Kimmage work for the Sunday Times asked
for an interview but didnt get one

LANCE Right and just as a little preface might might just clear up one
thing and the reason you didnt get it Paul wanted to make sure that was
you because dont know what you look like When decided to come back
for what think is a very noble reason you said Folks the cancer has been
in remission for 4 years but our cancer has now returned Meaning me
am here to fight this disease am here so that dont have to deal with it
you dont have to deal with it none of us have to deal with it my children
dont have to deal with it but yet you said that am the cancer and the
cancer is out of remission so think it goes without saying No were not
going to sit down and do an interview and dont think anybody in this room
would sit down for that interview You are not worth the chair that youre
sitting on with a statement like that with a disease that touches everybody
around the world

GEROGE HINCAPIE Lance was threatened there and the only thing he
knows what to do is to fight back

ALEX GIBNEY I have to say at least in the footage you look a little bit
uncomfortable

HINCAPIE Yeah you think Thats one of those moments you were
thinking Why the hell did you come back to this sport Like why do you
want to deal with this stuff mean here he was A successful retired
athlete had everything he wanted in the world Why would you want to come
back and suffer with with us mean theres not - This sport is not
glamorous at all mean you go out riding in 30 degrees and pouring rain
You just suffer on the bike all the time and yet he wanted to come back to it
and prove a point send a message

LITTLE GIRL IN CROWD It started

NARRATOR The misery of the rain stung one rider more than most Lance’s
old teammate Floyd Landis Floyd had ridden with Lance for three Tour
wins he also won the tour on his own only to be busted for doping In the
middle of the pack he wondered why should he be treated as a cheater
while his own teammate Lance Armstrong was welcomed back as a hero

JOHAN BRUYNEEL Great job boys Congratulations

REED ALBERGOTTI Floyd actually contacted Johan Bruyneel and he said

the best riders in the world

LANCE look to have some good days If left the Tour of Italy and didnt
win a stage and wasnt a factor in some of the difficult days Id be

NARRATOR To challenge his critics Lance started to post his blood values

concluded that Lance was riding clean The big question was could he
compete

JOHAN BRUYNEEL Any time you see him if hes in trouble he can never
be alone So uh Donny Jani and Chechu on the climb you guys look for

NARRATOR After his poor performance in Italy Lance had to find some
way to get better With only a month before the Tour De France Lance
trained in Aspen with his Astana teammate Levi Leipheimer For both men
riding in the Rockies was all about the altitude Training in the thin air causes
the body to produce more red blood cells the exact same effect as EPO
learned that altitude training also played a role in doping To prepare for
competition riders would often train in the mountains to boost their red blood
cells take out a bag or two and then be ready to transfuse them during a
Tour At the time wondered was that what Lance was doing in Aspen

NARRATOR watched Lance and Levi do a series of 1k tests Timed runs
up a one-kilometer hill with a blood test at the top of each climb They
measure lactic acid levels which indicate fitness and the ability of a riders
leg muscles to deliver sustained power over time Its a test that was
developed and refined in Italy by Michele Ferrari

ALEX GIBNEY Youll still pass on a suggestion or two from time to time to
Lance

MICHELE FERRARI Yes not so many as in the past But probably he he
doesnt need so many But sometimes give him some inputs May be
useful

NARRATOR They were useful Lance had told everyone that he had
stopped working with Ferrari in 2004 But an investigation by Italian police
revealed that Armstrong kept contact with Ferrari though his son Stefano In
emails Papa Ferrari was known by his nickname Schumi Bank records and
emails confirmed Armstrong’s payments to Ferrari

LANCE ARMSTRONG In 2009 wasnt honest about my relationship with
him but didnt know who else to trust when it came to training and advice
And to his credit he was the first to say You cannot take any risk they
they are coming for you They want you

NARRATOR From Italy Ferrari monitored Lances progress He compared
his performance from a month earlier and concluded that Lance had
improved by 10 in his power output number watts per kilogram

LANCE ARMSTRONG The watts per kilo number now just a hair under 65
65 might be good enough to win the tour Umm Ive seen higher Ive been
higher

MICHELE FERRARI The best Lance with 1k test was 7 more than 7 The
best Lance was the year of the last Tour win

ALEX GIBNEY 2005

MICHELE FERRARI He won the tour like this (indicates smoking a
cigarette) Yeah it was impressive Lance took it easy because if you if you
win too much you then everybody blah blah blah

LANCE ARMSTRONG The other seven tours in late June you know the
last test before the tour based on power output we sat down and said OK
we win If we dont fall off the bike if you don’t get sick if you don’t have any
kind of you know terrible strategic error you win easy Its amazing

LANCE ARMSTRONG 45 326 At 326 326 Ohh snap 47 Ohhhh
LEVI LEIPHEIMER He pushed too hard on my finger

returns to the sport of cycling and when he left in 2005 he wouldnt be back
he said There he is hes back

JOHAN BRUYNEEL Going good going good going good come on
accelerate bit by bit come on come on come on

NARRATOR In the first stage a short time trial Lance wanted to make a
statement In the past he had always dominated time trials An impressive
performance here would show everyone he was back

JOHAN BRUYNEEL He doesnt look uh good to me no Come on Lance
come on come on come on pick it up come on come on go go go go

TOUR ANNOUNCER Look at his face Lance Armstrong seven times a
winner in Tour De France hes headed for the best time

NARRATOR Lances time put him in first place by 30 seconds but with all
the best riders still to come

TOUR ANNOUNCER Cancellara pushes on for the finish Hes looking to
beat the time of Bradley Wiggins of 1951 He’s sprinting for the line and the
best time

NARRATOR One by one the best riders in the world including his Astana
teammate Alberto Contador beat his time

TOUR ANNOUNCER A great ride by Alberto Contador who won the tour in
2007 Contador is second Is he now the leader of Astana He certainly laid
claim to that Well that’s a great ride by this little man

NARRATOR Lance Finished the first stage in 10th place--40 seconds
behind the leader and 22 seconds behind his teammate Alberto Contador

Tour Footage--Fans Cheering for Alberto Contador

NARRATOR From the start watched Lances comeback hopes collide with
a ferocious rider who bore an eerie resemblance to Armstrong ten years
earlier

FRANKIE ANDREU These guys never talked to each other They came out
of the bus--I never once saw them look at each other make eye contact
They would walk right past each other It was the weirdest thing

LANCE ARMSTRONG mean the honest truth is that theres a little tension
at the dinner table

LANCE ARMSTRONG Hes got the gun-slinger hat on Journalists behind
That would drive me nuts

MARK HIGGINS This guy’s gonna fall in the fuckin’ water
That would drive me nuts--People behind me

NARRATOR The Tour de France is the worlds most demanding sporting
event It covers 2200 miles over 3 weeks The 21 daily stages combine flat
roads brutal climbs and time trials Each day among the entire group of
cyclists known as the Peloton the rider with the fastest overall time wears
the yellow jersey or the Maillot Jaune While each team in the tour has nine
riders usually just one the team leader is riding for the yellow jersey On
Astana Armstrong and Contador were dueling for the right to lead The
other cyclists were known as domestiques French for servants

JOHAN BRUYNEEL unknown name has no arm-warmers This this ok
Who else Anybody else

ASTANA DOMESTIQUE An energy bar for Alberto
JOHAN BRUYNEEL This

NARRATOR Another job of the domestiques is to shelter team leaders from
the wind When riding at high speeds on flat roads the effects of wind
resistance are huge Riders in front have to work as much as 30 percent
harder than those sheltering behind At high speeds you can see the
domestiques often from different teams sharing the work of fighting the
wind

DAN COYLE For Lances victories there were some where he rode in front
by himself only a matter of minutes--like 3-5 minutes for the entire tour
because he essentially is using the muscle of his team as an extension of
himself to drive forward and to burn other people off

NARRATOR Relying on a group of domestiques Lance found a way to use
the wind when the cyclists rode near the ocean and sea breezes whipped
into the Peloton

LANCE ARMSTRONG We were coming into that corner and was about
40 guys back and was kinda like eh like better move up

NARRATOR The crosswinds caused the split in the Peloton Lance and
two of his domestiques made it to the front group The rest of his Astana
teammates including Contador were left behind In this situation Lance
reached out to an old teammate now on a different team George Hincapie

LANCE ARMSTRONG had to call in some favors George and those
guys said George you keep ridinghard Just like would do in the old
days you know when we were on the same team

GEORGE HINCAPIE just remember Lance being all fired up that he was
in the first group and you know asking us to go harder And were like
dude were doing our own thing here Sure youre here but you know were
not really doing this for you

TOUR ANNOUNCER They could be putting Lance Armstrong in yellow in
the next 24 hours A little bit further back down the road this is Alberto
Contador He got caught out but hes keeping at the front end of the main
field but wonder what hes thinking about the presence of Lance Armstrong
in that little group

ALEX GIBNEY French Radio was like Oh this is a betrayal’
LANCE ARMSTRONG Betrayal

ALEX GIBNEY Its like why is he riding out front Why is he pulling Why
don’t they wait for Alberto

LANCE ARMSTRONG Cause won the fucking Tour de France 7 times
Thats why were out there riding Thats that’s not that’s notthats stupid
If you can take advantage of the wind or any other situation like that thats
the way you race bikes Thats the way you win bike races We were in the
right place at the right time and deserved to have those guys ride Thats
why told Johan Its like you better start getting used tothis again
because

NARRATOR The breakaway finished 41 seconds ahead of the Peloton
Enough to move Lance from 10th to 3rd--19 seconds ahead of Contador
Suddenly Lances comeback was looking pretty good

LANCE ARMSTRONG If everything goes right mean if it goes perfectly for
us and not that great for the others we take the yellow jersey mean it
would be laughs and snorts

ALEX GIBNEY You dont want to take the yellow jersey this early in the
Tour do you

LANCE ARMSTRONG No Sure Id take it Hell yeah Four years later
why not Id totally take it Im peddling tomorrow for that

NARRATOR Looking back on that moment now admit that was caught
up wasnt naive about past doping allegations but couldnt help but root
for the old pro And he promised he was doing it clean

NARRATOR But my presence at the Tour and my access to Lance was
mystifying to Lances long-time critics

BILL STRICKLAND I thought it was odd that you were doing a movie about
the comeback because uh it seemed like it was going to be an inspirational
movie

BETSY ANDREU The fear was that you would buy into the bullshit

NARRATOR was afraid was starting to buy into the bullshit too So
sought out Jonathan Vaughters He was running Team Garmin the so-
called anti-doping team but he wouldnt agree to talk with me Back then he
had not yet made public what he knew about Lance’s doping

JONATHAN VAUGHTERS People have to realize that the truth in all this is
hard Such a huge number of people wanted to believe so bad that they
hated anyone who didnt believe and hated anyone who questioned it As a
team manager imagine what the reaction would have been had said
something about Lance--lose the team lose the riders you know lose the
whole thing

NARRATOR As it happened Vaughters had a dog in the hunt in 2009
Bradley Wiggins was one of the leaders and Lances team was worried
about him

JOHAN BRUYNEEL We want to get rid of Wiggins You too And know
that ultimately you want to get rid of us too but thats another story

NARRATOR Everyone at the tour was playing angles Greg LeMond a
former Tour winner and longtime Lance critic paid for a video crew to tail
Lances comeback Their mission according to the cameraman in the straw
cowboy hat was to make the anti-Gibney film

NARRATOR was caught in the middle of a battle between the
mythmakers and the myth-busters One of the strangest sub-plots was
Lances interview strategy He insisted that the only American to be able to
interview him would be Frankie Andreu an ex-teammate he had feuded with
for years

BILL STRICKLAND Lance has multiple motivations--One of them was sort
of to show Frankie that he could still make Frankie do whatever he wanted
one of the them was to show everyone that--hey can accept Frankie back--
Im not you know I’m not the jerk the other one was to control who had
access to him So all that was going on

NARRATOR Months before was in the car with Lance when he hatched
his plan to make Frankie wait outside the bus every day to interview him
Johan begged him not to do it but Lance couldnt contain himself When
asked him later about the Frankie plot Lance was back on message

ALEX GIBNEY But there wasnt anything mischievous about it like he you
know Frankies gonna have to come to me now after those days

FRANKIE TO LANCE All right Thank you
LANCE ARMSTRONG Yep

FRANKIE ANDREU And to say the least was shocked because for four or
five years before that we just walked right past each other they - with no
eye contact with me wouldnt say a word to me

NARRATOR Lance Frankie and his wife Betsy had once been good
friends Frankie had been on three US Postal Teams but in 2000 Lance’s
2 Tour win Frankie wouldn’t dope He asked for a raise but the team
director Johan told him he’d have to take a steep pay cut

BETSY ANDREU When Frankie was looking at other teams he had two
other offers He was on the phone with Johan who asked him well which
teams are you looking at and Frankie told him the two teams Offers
rescinded

Deposition Footage

NARRATOR In late 2005 Frankie and Betsy were served with subpoenas
to testify in a lawsuit involving Lance At issue was doping and a
conversation between Lance and his doctor while he was being treated for
cancer

JUDGE Lets talk about the Indiana hospital room Tell us what was said
during this conversation

FRANKIE ANDREU A group of us were inside of a room where Lance uh
had mentioned that he had taken certain drugs when a doctor asked him
about it

BETSY ANDREU The doctor came in said to Lance I think we should
leave to give you your privacy and Lance said No Thats ok You can

LANCE 100 percent Absolutely

JUDGE Do you also deny what Mr Andreu said regarding those
statements

LANCE 100 percent How could it have taken place when Ive never taken
performance-enhancing drugs How could that have happened

JUDGE That was my point You’re not- Its not simply that you dont recall

LANCE How many times do have to say it If you have a doping offense
or you test positive it goes without saying that youre fired from all of your
contracts Not just the team but theres numerous contracts that have that
would all go away

JUDGE Sponsorship agreements for example

LANCE All of them Andthe faith of all the cancer survivors around the
world So everything do off of the bike would go away too And dont think
for a second dont understand that

LANCE ARMSTRONG Yeah that that was uh honestly that’s that’s - its
embarrassing to hear Uh its humiliating That was going too far know
that now Um didnt at the time

he had taken those various performance-enhancing drugs

FRANKIE ANDREU Yeah was surprised

FRANKIE ANDREU From that point on tying to do announcing gigs or
commentary or work and was “too controversial” And was told that a lot
was shunned banned from everybody A lot of people you know wouldnt

remember if they had a clip board couldnt remember anything

him sustain the myth One of those was Stephanie Mcllvain She worked
for Oakley one of Armstrong’s sponsors She had also been in the hospital
room According to Betsy in their conversations Stephanie confirmed
Betsys story But in Stephanie’s deposition she took Lances side

NARRATOR From the moment Betsy started speaking out Frankie was
confronted by an old teammate George Hincapie

GEORGE HINCAPIE Frankie was my mentor and the first time ever saw
dope was in Frankies refrigerator and thats when realized-- fuck have to
dope So for me that really bothered me that all the sudden he changed
and he wasnt racing anymore and said well Lance is doping Well mean
you taught me how to dope How could you stand by when you know that
you did what you did Lance never sat there and said are you gonna dope
or your out or I’m firing you Thats just not true and they made it seem like
that was the case

FRANKIE ANDREU Youre either on his side or youre off his side If you
crossed him you were doomed You were thrown out very quickly cast
aside and then you could sit there waiting for the revenge to be sent upon
you

BETSY ANDREU One of his many modus operandi was just sue--the
financial drain the emotional drain the mental drain

STEVE MADDEN Its a pretty effective legal strategy when you think about
it It’s like Ive got deeper pockets and can fight this war of attrition and
you cant

LANCE ARMSTRONG It just built one upon another and the denials
became more defiant and the and the arguments became more heated
should have just backed away

NARRATOR In 2004 Armstrong launched lawsuits over LA Confidentiel
the first book to air doping charges against him He stopped its publication
in America forced an apology and won a judgment worth 15M that
tarnished the reputation of the co-author David Walsh

DAVID WALSH How can this guy dope so much and not get caught That
tells us about how cycling was run It tells us about the attitudes of the UCI
which is the world governing body for cycling Its president for most of the
Lance Armstrong years was Hein Verbruggen Hein Verbruggen and Lance
Armstrong have always been friends

REED ALBERGOTTI The UCI denies that they ever covered up a drug test
for Lance Armstrong but they do say that when Lance and other top riders
tested with suspicious levels they would go and talk to those riders and
they would say ‘listen youre flying a little too close to the sun Were going
to be watching you You better stop what youre doing

LANCE ARMSTRONG There were dozens if not hundreds of those
conversations going ‘hey this is close

B-Roll Footage of the Road with chalked MAFIA UCI Armstrong

LANCE ARMSTRONG The truth is that everybody was making money
Everybody And and mean everybody Trek bicycles in 1998 does 100
million dollars in revenue and now they are pushing a billion We all made
money Some made a lot more than others

NARRATOR Some of Verbruggens money was managed in an appearance
of conflict of interest by an investment firm owned by the man who
bankrolled Armstrongs team As head of the UCI Verbruggen knew how
much money and popularity Lance had brought to the sport So when
LEquipe published evidence of doping by Armstrong cycling had a problem

LANCE ARMSTRONG It was in his interest for the sport to continue to to
grow and grow controversy free A thing we werent very good at mean it
was controversies every year Every year Big ones

EMILE VRIJMAN In the conversation Hein Verbruggen clearly was the
focus point of saying “Find out what kind of research did they do is ita
positive test according to our definitions and if yes should we do something
about it”

NARRATOR Oddly the Vrijman report didn’t focus on whether Lance had
doped Instead it looked at technical details lab protocols and attacked the
World Anti Doping Agency Without examining samples for drug use the
report concluded that Lance was completely exonerated

Archival Footage LANCE ARMSTRONG The 130 page Vrijman report that
came out mean he was the independent investigator hired by our
international federation that outlined very clearly what happened

NARRATOR What Lance didnt say then but what he told me years later
was that he and his team had input on the report and were delighted with the
result based on further talks with Lance had more questions

ALEX GIBNEY Did you or your law firm receive any payments from Lance
Armstrong or his representatives

VRIJMAN Not at all As far as know not at all

NARRATOR Vrijman’s denial led me to an odd coincidence in 2007 the UCI
paid the final bill for the report approximately 100000 Earlier that year
Lance had made a donation to the UCI The amount 100000 The reason
says the UCI to pay for a blood-testing machine purchased in 2005

LANCE ARMSTRONG Listen nobody believes in doping controls more than
me have submitted to all of them whether in competition or outta
competition

NARRATOR On the road Lance was able to protect his lie by enforcing the
power of Omerta a code of silence among riders about doping

FILIPPO SIMEONI During the 2004 tour Lance Armstrong very publicly
humiliated me

ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE

COMMENTATOR What happened was that Filippo Simeoni tried to attack
to join the six-man breakaway that had built up a bit of a lead on the Peloton
The trouble is that Lance doesnt like Simeoni who is actually suing him for
slander in Italy after Armstrong called him a liar

ALEX GIBNEY Was that all about Ferrari
GEORGE HINCAPIE laughs

FRANKIE ANDREU Simeoni had testified at a trial against Ferrari and
Lance was working with Michele Ferrari and considered Ferrari a good

know Simeoni was trying to win the stage and pretty much Lance said no
way

GEROGE HINCAPIE It was kind of wrong of him to do that but the Peloton
was happy about it because they didnt appreciate what Simeoni was doing
at that point They all-

ALEX GIBENEY You mean sort of outing the secret

GEORGE HINCAPIE Yeah outing the secret They were all probably
doing the same thing

RACE FOOTAGE

COMMENTATOR The result was that Simeoni returned to the field having
apparently been told by Lance to sit at the back and shut up Thats the kind
of authority the patron of the Peloton has and Lance is not afraid to wield it

REPORTER Lance can ask just what when on between you and Simeoni
today in the race

same time very very loyal and supportive and Ive been on both sides

FRANKIE INTERVIEWING LANCE
FRANKIE What do you expect at the finish for yourself

LANCE Honestly don’t I dont know Um you know if if if
Cancellara is dropped and the climb isnt as hard as we all think and and

Lance had dominated in the past But unlike previous tours Lance didnt
look like he was in control

BILL STRICKLAND He sure rode like he was clean He was struggling
physically He looked beaten for for a lot of those stages

VAUGHTERS He was not anywhere close to as fast as where he was in
2001 or 99 but he was also almost 40 years old

ALEX GIBNEY Is it conceivable to think that he was racing clean in 2009
VAUGHTERS Its possible You know he he knows the answer to that

LANCE ARMSTRONG Not that the sport was harder but was found it
harder and dont know if it was being older or if it was being clean or if it
was-- wanna believe that the rest of the group was clean in ‘09 cant
speak for them but you know like to believe that we all were basically
clean

LANCE CYCLING

B-Roll BIKERS AROUND TURN

NARRATOR Lance had lost ground but he was still close to the lead and
only 2 seconds behind his rival Contador going into the biggest climb of the
Tour figured if Lance was gonna manage his mythic comeback he would
have to beat Contador here But would that be enough to put an end to all
the questions about the past

BRUYNEEL (Speech to team on bus) Today is a very important day We
have two weeks of racing behind us We have one very hard week ahead of
us and today could be a day where a lot of things change You know
everybody is always talking about Alberto Lance--Lance Alberto We are
here to win the Tour de France Of course both of them are feeling good
and both of them want to try to win

COMMENTATOR Theres the pistol shot Alberto Contadors over the line
hes the next Maillot Jaune of the Tour de France

COMMENTATOR 2 Very fast at the bottom of the climb Contador went
once and he went after him and the second time he went what were your
thoughts there

LANCE TO REPORTER mean he showed hes the best rider in the race--
certainly the best climber and you know when everybody on the limit and
then you can accelerate again--lve been there and it’s uh

FRANKIE REPORTING Do you think your chances for winning the tour
now are over

LANCE TO REPORTER Um yeah It will be hard mean it’s it’s you
know a day like this really shows whos the best and and uh you know
wasnt on par with uh with whats required to win the tour so mean for
me thats that’s the reality Thats not uh that that’s not devastating news
or anything uh

FRANKIE REPORTING But are you are you disappointed with

FRANKIE The Lance Armstrong know always is a fighter always is one
that is in attack mode and when asked him that question he was different
You know think there was a lot of doubt in his head on what he was gonna
be able to accomplish at that tour

BILL STRICKLAND When Frankie was talking to him it was such an honest
exchange between those two guys When he was looking at this guy whod
been his friend for years as well as his teammate and who had doped And
he seemed to be admitting to Frankie more so than to the camera that I’m
just dont have it Im not good enough He had lost time and he showed
himself to be the weaker rider

POV BIKING SHOT

NARRATOR dont think Lances apology was just banter Part of it was
real--saying he was sorry he couldnt deliver one more time--the perfect fairy
tale that everyone had come to expect

NARRATOR Going forward he was looking for a way to salvage things
What meaning would his comeback have if he couldn’t finish in the top three
Now in second he braced for attacks from Garmins Bradley Wiggins and
the Schleck Brothers All determined to push him off the podium

B-Roll BRUYNEEL IN CAR HANDING OUT WATER AND ENERGY BARS

NARRATOR Johan knew that Lance was not at his best So he pursued a
delicate strategy--protecting Contadors yellow jersey and a spot on the
podium for his old friend

BILL STRICKLAND Without the podium the comeback its not just a wash
but its a you know disaster for him

BRUYNEEL GIVING INSTRUCTIONS Hey Alberto remember that to win
the Tour you dont have to attack Only if you know you can leave everyone
then you can go

NARRATOR Johan didnt want Contador to attack because he might push
the Schlecks to a faster pace than they would ride on their own If they
raced ahead that could cost Lance a spot on the podium

COMMENTATOR Whats happening here Contadors moved Hes
decided to go it alone Now can there be a reaction from Andy after all the
work that man has done Contador is now going for the top

BRUYNEEL Good enough

COMMENTATOR Hes allowed himself just under 2km to the summit and
hes going for the win Contador testing the waters here this afternoon but

is famous for is the acceleration on the mountains

BRUYNEEL There was no need for that shit
B-roll of ascent up mountains
JOHAN BRUYNEEL Shit

NARRATOR Lance took dangerous chances on the descent It was his only
chance to get back in the game By following Contadors attack the Schleck
brothers were now 2nd and 3rd behind Contador Lance was in fourth off
the podium wondered what words were exchanged between Contador and
the Schlecks

JOHAN BRUYNEEL He doesnt care Hes going all alone on the podium
not with the team

FRANKIE ANDREU dont blame Contador one bit He didnt trust anybody
on that team and he wanted to make sure that he had that yellow jersey
firmly on his shoulders He learned this from Lance When you have a
chance to seize the yellow jersey and take time out of your opponents you
do it Alberto was doing textbook Lance Armstrong it just backfired on
Lance

JOHAN BRUYNEEL This guy is really unbelievable Why did he have to
attack

NARRATOR There was still one more mountain to climb cycling’s mythic
Mont Ventoux If Lance didnt do well here his whole comeback would
backfire Some people would say he lost precisely because he couldnt win
clean It was a tough challenge In years past Lance had never won
Ventoux

LANCE Ive had such a long history with that fucking mountain

NARRATOR Lance believed that a strong showing here might somehow
extinguish the doubts that haunted his legacy Following a time trial
Contador was still safely in the lead But Lance had clawed his way back to
third place just a few seconds ahead of Wiggins and Frank Schleck and
just over a minute behind Andy Schleck The Schlecks seemed determined
to break Armstrongs will by attacking him again and again But this time
Armstrong would not be dropped

RACE ANNOUNCER Look at the face of Armstrong there hes just telling
Frank You aint going nowhere this afternoon mate because Im going to
stick all over your back wheel

that group and he was not going to lose time was like Hes- he’s going to
do it cant believe it You know The guy is amazing

DAN COYLE To see him not just hanging on but having some aggression
Not just surviving but asserting was the most dramatic moment of the Tour
He wasnt going to win he was doing it for some other reason You know
Some reason that was unfamiliar to him

NARRATOR was caught up too At that moment on that fucking mountain
was just a fan Rooting for Lance Just before the finish Wiggins cracked
but Lance found another gear He pedaled on with Contador and the
Schlecks

LANCE It was a good day thought would be fine but felt better than
expected

ALEX GIBNEY Right
Lance Armstrong Which was good

LANCE ARMSTRONG Although came in here and wanted to win and
thought could win thought could be close Uh I’m not thats not going to
happen Im going to get third can stand on the third step and still say that
have won And Ive won because of all of the reasons wanted to do this
And my foundation has benefitted cancer survivors and their families all
over the world have benefitted because of this think Ive answered a lot of
questions about the performances in the past

ALEX GIBNEY Right
LANCE ARMSTRONG Um

NARRATOR It was incredible No sooner was the race over and Lance was
busy writing a new ending to his story One that even the French embraced
The headline in the paper that had once trumpeted The Armstrong Lie now
sang a different tune Chapeau Le Texan Hats off to Armstrong This was
the perfect ending for the original movie started to make But four years
later investigations revealed something strange about Lances blood values
in 2009 During the tour Lance should have seen a decrease in the
concentration of his red blood cells instead there was an increase more
than once and just before Ventoux the day he saved his comeback

BILL STRICKLAND What happened there with Ventoux was kind of what
happened with his life Just like when he was a kid and he couldnt do it
clean there came a point in 2009 when he couldnt do it clean and think
he’d made that deal again before Ventoux

LANCE know what know and know that it was clean We finished the
Ventoux it was a five or six-hour day it was hot it was hard obviously

take the blood draw Ive never in my career had blood taken at the end of a
day at the end of a stage like that It does not happen

ALEX GIBNEY Why

LANCE ARMSTRONG Because its normal and natural that when the body
goes through stress like that the body is obviously extra if not very
dehydrated extremely hydrateddehydrated Its not uh what they would
call steady state And and think thats think that’s common knowledge
and common science Its not a fair number

BILL STRICKLAND You know he still swears to me that he didnt Weve
talked about this and tell him Thats really thats a tough one to
believe

NARRATOR It was tough for me to believe too since Lance had lied to me
so often But he was adamant he did not dope in 2009 Why was Lance
hanging on to this one Could it possibly be true Or was the comeback a
new lie to replace the old one

DAN COYLE Armstrong was in a position of saying Look Im going to do
what did in 99 Im going to come in in the wake of this Im going to clean
up my name Im going to prove that Im doing it clean Its like a bank
robber breaking back into the bank again with everyone watching Feeling
he would get away with it Feeling sure he would get away with it

STEVE MADDEN Maybe this is why they came after you Its almost like
you were daring them to to look under the hood And they did

NARRATOR We now know that the comeback was not a new beginning
but the beginning of the end Yet at the time in the fading sun of Paris
Lance imagined the start of a new chapter to his mythic story

LANCE And Ill be back next year (laughs) And then maybe well really win

NARRATOR In 2010 Lance did not win He finished 23rd Contador won
the race and was busted for violating doping regulations

ABC ANCHOR KARLINSKY Did you see Lance Armstrong using
performance-enhancing drugs

FLOYD LANDIS had yeah

NARRATOR Armstrongs comeback brought all his enemies out of the
woodwork The first to come forward was Lances old teammate Floyd
Landis

FLOYD LANDIS Yes saw Lance Armstrong using drugs

several times and had a very different version This is a man that uh that

give me one word to sum this all up Credibility Theres there’s uh Floyd
lost his credibility a long time ago

NARRATOR In the hubbub over Landis a new name surfaced Jeff
Novitzky He had prosecuted Barry Bonds and now was part of the FDA
who was looking at Armstrong

LANCE ARMSTRONG Why would Novitzky have anything to do with with
what a what an athlete does in Europe

DAN COYLE Armstrongs team was sponsored by a branch of the federal
government the US Postal Service It may have involved transfers of
controlled substances it may have been money laundering tax evasion
bribing foreign officials

REED ALBERGOTTI Doping is not illegal but its everything that happens
around doping that federal investigators wanted to try and use to prosecute
a crime

DAN COYLE They started subpoenaing cyclists one by one Assistants
wives

BETSY ANDREU Jeff Novitzky called me said “whats taken you so long
to call me Well I uh These things take time said Do you have a pen
and paper on hand And he said Yeah said Lets get to work

NARRATOR As the investigation continued another cyclist who had been
busted for doping Tyler Hamilton began to consider his options Tyler had
been Lance’s teammate in 1999

DAN COYLE Tyler had been subpoenaed by the grand jury and he hada
realization number one was all this is going to come out one-way or the
other The lie is too big And the second thing was that he wanted to tell his
story

60 Minutes 60 MINUTES ANCHOR (Scott Pelley) You saw Lance
Armstrong inject EPO

TYLER HAMILTON Yeah like we all did

DAN COYLE And you see in that footage Tylers intense discomfort at
facing the truth how hard that was Omerta is very real the code of silence
Which is why it took Tyler until he was talking to someone who had a badge
and a gun before he could fully start the process of telling the truth

up with a badge and a gun

going well Im just going to go lie to you know to a federal prosecutor Its

a surprising announcement It would not pursue charges against Armstrong
But USADA the United State Anti-Doping Agency continued with its own
investigation

NEWS FOOTAGE TRAVIS TYGART He was one of the ring leaders of this
conspiracy that pulled off this grand heist that defrauded using tens of
millions of tax-payer dollars defrauded millions of sports fans and his fellow
competitors

NARRATOR Travis Tygart with the help from government investigators
pried detailed testimony from many of Lances former teammates Landis
Vaughters Hamilton Andreu and most damaging of all to Lance his loyal
friend George Hincapie

GEORGE HINCAPIE They said cooperate and youll get six months
ALEX GIBNEY And dont cooperate
GEORGE HINCAPIE And you’re banned for life

NARRATOR Through his lawyers Lance attacked Tygart and USADA
USADA had said publicly that they had offered Lance the same deal as
everyone else Its a claim Armstrong and his lawyers deny

LANCE The message wasnt Hey we gotta give you something we gotta
give you six months We gotta give you a penalty a sanction” That did not
happen The call to me came and said Youre screwed Why dont you
come on in here and confess But dont understand Then why go tell the
world every opportunity you get today that we offered Lance the same deal
that we offered everybody else Just say We wanted him We got him Go
dance on his grave

NARRATOR USADA banned Armstrong for life His sponsors and
Livestrong cut all ties The UCI stripped him of all his Tour de France titles
and his 3 place finish in 2009 Armstrong responded with a defiant tweet

LANCE know what it took to win those Tours Ok it was a little more
detailed than we were told or you guys were told But know what it took
and my teammates know what it took And those 200-strong pelotons over
seven years they know what it took And they know who won

NARRATOR Lance still refused to admit to doping but his fans no longer
believed in his denials With his fairy tale story in tatters Lance reached out
to friends and critics alike and began to wonder out loud if he should at last
admit to his lie

BETSY ANDREU After ten years of his tirade on me he called to say he
was sorry It’s sort of emotional it was it was it it took a lot of courage for
him to say he was sorry and for him to tell me he’s done a lot of bad things
to good people

FRANKIE ANDREU And said You know Im sure this was a tough phone
call for you to make and Im sure that these last two months have been hell
for you But said You know what Youve put me through hell for ten
years said Youre going through nothing hope you do the right thing

BILL STRICKLAND He started calling me and we got to talk about how his
secrets were going to be given to the world

NARRATOR His decision to go on Oprah did not win back his fans
Particularly those who had defended his lie

LANCE ARMSTRONG For the cycling crowd it wasnt enough They didnt
hear enough they wanted to hear more didnt say enough didnt tell them
enough And for the general population it was too much which leads to
everybody being pissed off

BETSY ANDREU Because he had lied for so long and he was so vicious in
protecting that lie um dont think people were I really think that people
said OK wait Lets let’s see what he does Just because he says this
stuff does not mean everything is going to be ok

BILL STRICKLAND We understand now that if you wanted to win or if you
wanted to help someone win or if you wanted to make a good living you
had to dope in that era We understand that now And think people would
give him that context but its it’s the lie

BETSY ANDREU The doping is bad but Lances abuse of power is worse

LANCE ARMSTRONG see the anger in people And they have every right
to feel betrayed And and its my fault

one thing

But at this point

BILL STRICKLAND You know it doesnt really matter what happened in that
hospital room doesnt matter at all anymore but its symbolic weight is
enormous

FRANKIE ANDREU Its not about doping anymore thats out there thats

NARRATOR Another definition for cheat is to deceive Thats why Lance is
a cheater He deceived his fans Yet its also fair to say that they were willing
to be fooled So many people from cancer survivors to reporters to
sponsors to myself loved the beautiful lie more than the ugly truth The
story was a best seller for Lance too It made him a fortune of over 125
million dollars That is a bitter truth it pays to believe in winning at all costs
And the cruelty Lance showed his enemies off the bike was the very thing
that allowed him to win on the bike

LANCE People will forgive and forget and move on or they wont
ALEX GIBNEY Mmm hmm

happened And then judge for themselves mean dont know what
people will think in 20 30 40 50 years Is the record book still going to be

people go they look at this thing in in the context that it is and say Well
yeahhe won the Tour de France seven times
