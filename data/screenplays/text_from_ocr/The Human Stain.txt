1 EXT BERKSHIRE WOODS - NIGHT 1
A OLD VOLVO driving along a small winding road

NATHANS VOICE OVER
This is the story of the tricky
life and bitter downfall of
Coleman Silk

ANOTHER ANGLE ON THE VOLVO as THE CREDITS BEGIN We watch the
car wending its moonlit way The radio in the car is playing
Rogers and Hart

2 INT VOLVO - CONTINUOUS 2
The DRIVER an attractive MAN in his mid-sixties Leaning
serenely against him eyes closed a handsome WOMAN mid
thirties

As THE CREDITS CONTINUE we occasionally CUT TO A SHOT OF A
BEAT UP RED PICK UP TRUCK sitting ominously in the shadows at
the side of the road As THE CREDITS END we CUT TO

CLOSE ON THE WINDSHIELD OF THE PICK UP TRUCK--inside we see
a shadowy figure

HIS POV (TELEPHOTO SHOT) (looking through the windshield) in
the distance the Volvo rounds a curve in our direction

3 EXT THE PARKED RED PICK-UP TRUCK - CONTINUOUS 3
As the HEADLIGHTS wink on the pick-up roars to life and
squeals onto the road heading in the opposite direction as

the Volvo

SEVERAL ANGLES-We see the Volvo and the pick-up heading
towards each other on the curving road

When the vehicles are near enough to see each others lights
the pick-up abruptly swerves into the oncoming lane

The couple suddenly BLINDED by the glare of headlights The
woman wakes up startled squints -

The Volvo barely avoids the oncoming pick-up but careens off

the road plunging wildly down a steep embankment
ricochetting off TREES and flipping into a small RIVER
5 5

CLOSER NO MOVEMENT FROM WITHIN there is a terrible
silence Suddenly we hear the scream of a bird and CUT TO

6 EXT ATHENA COLLEGE - DAY 6

TIGHT ON A LARGE CROW as it flaps it wings and flies away
screeching as it disappears into the sky We see in the
distance the tall steeple of a beautiful white church set
against the Berkshires in the distance It is an idyllic
setting over this we HEAR

A MANS VOICE
Hey if Clinton had fucked her in
the ass none of this would have
happened

THE CAMERA MOVES ACROSS to reveal A TRIO OF TENNIS PLAYERS
(ALL MIDDLEAGED MEN) - walking after a game carrying their
rackets swigging bottled water and laughing In the
background we see a picturesque small New England campus
old red-brick ivy covered white-columned buildings
bisecting footpaths and huge spreading trees benches

1ST TENNIS PLAYER
(the original voice)
That wouldve kept her quiet
Besides in Arkansas youre
expected to be an ass man Thats
tradition

2ND TENNIS PLAYER
Wait a minute she was overwhelmed
by Starrs team in that hotel
room 11 guys hitting on her
That was a gang bang

3RD TENNIS PLAYER
Come on she was talking to Linda
Tripp talking to everybody Shes
part of that dopey culture Yap
yap yap-

1ST TENNIS PLAYER
Look if Clinton couldnt figure
Monica Lewinsky then the guy
shouldnt be president thats
grounds for impeachment by itself

Laughter By now the three men have passed THE CAMERA and are
heading away from us

2ND TENNIS PLAYER
I keep telling you guys in the
ass is how you create loyalty
6 6

3RD TENNIS PLAYER
Know what Kennedy would have told
her Nixon They would have told
her that not only would they not
give her a job nobody would ever
give her a job again as long as
she lived That her father would
be out of work And her mother and
her brother That no one in her
family would earn another dime if
she dared to open her mouth

2ND TENNIS PLAYER
Yeah he played it like a lawyer
Thats why he didnt want to come

1ST TENNIS PLAYER

Hey when he came he was
finished Evidence The smoking
come

(laughter)
If hed fucked her in the ass the
nation would have been spared this
terrible trauma

As the men continue walking away from THE CAMERA laughing
and talking we HEAR

NATHANS VOICE OVER
1998 was the summer of sanctimony
America was on a piety binge
Propriety was king After the
fall of Communism and before the
horrors of terrorism there was a
brief interlude when the nation
was preoccupied by cocksucking

Just then the tennis players intersect an attractive man in
his mid-sixties his name is COLEMAN SILK and he is the same
man we saw earlier in the car crash He wears a well cut
harris tweed jacket grey flannels and carries a worn but
expensive briefcase

NATHANS VOICE OVER
(continuing)
What Nathaniel Hawthorne called
the persecuting spirit was
abroad in the land And Bill
Clinton was not its only target

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS COLEMAN SILK as he walks quickly across
the campus heading toward a classroom building in the
distance
6 6

NATHANS VOICE OVER

(continuing)
This is Coleman Silk Before the
car crash of course Once the
powerful Dean of Faculty and
professor of Classics at Athena
College in western Massachusetts
one of the first Jews to teach in
a classics department anywhere in
America Coleman had spent over
thirty years at Athena He took
a pokey Sleepy Hollow-type
college and dragged it kicking and
screaming from mediocrity to
excellence

As he enters the imposing looking building we HOLD FOR A BEAT

NATHANS VOICE OVER

(continuing)
Of course in the process he made
a good many enemies and finally

the persecuting spirit caught up
with Coleman

DISSOLVE TO
7 INT CLASSROOM - SAME 7

ON A BEAUTIFUL PALLADIAN WINDOW--that looks out onto another
imposing church this one in the Gothic style Over this we
hear Coleman Silk reciting first in Greek then in English

COLEMANS VOICE
Sing O Gods of the wrath of
Achilles

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN FROM THE WINDOW TO COLEMAN SILK who
stands in front of a desk on a raised platform He holds a
worn copy if the Iliad in one hand

COLEMANS VOICE

(continuing)
All of European literature springs
from a fight--a barroom brawl
really And what was Achilles so
angry about He and King Agamemnon
are quarreling over a woman a
young girl and her body and the
delights of sexual rapacity
Achilles the most hypersensitive
killing machine in the history of
warfare
7 7

COLEMANS VOICE (contd)

Achilles who because of his rage
at not getting the girl--isolates
himself defiantly outside the very
society whose protector he is and
whose need of him is enormous
Achilles has to give back the girl

(a beat)
This is how the great imaginative
literature of Europe begins and
that is why three thousand years
later we are going to begin there
today Miss

(scanning the paper

on the desk in front

cf him)
Cummings can you tell us

Coleman looks up

HIS POV thirty students silent there is no sign of a
response

CLOSER ON COLEMAN--frowning

COLEMAN

(sardonic)
Still not here And Mr Thomas

(a beat)
Were five weeks into the semester
and I havent laid eyes on either
of these folks Do these people
exist or are they spooks

FREEZE FRAME ON COLEMAN-

NATHANS VOICE OVER
And now they had him After
thirty years of academic
distinction Coleman Silk would be
brought down by the use of one
single word

8 INT FACULTY CONFERENCE ROOM — DAY 8

ON PROFESSOR DELPHINE ROUX--forty years old chic french
accented She is the chairperson of a faculty committee of
seven We note that one of the members of the committee is a
middle aged black man (HERB KEBLE)

PROFESSOR ROUX
Were you aware Professor Silk
that Tracy Cummings and William
Thomas are African Americans
8 8

CROSS-CUT TO COLEMAN who sits across the table from them
baffled

COLEMAN
(with icy sarcasm)
How could I be Ive never seen
them

PROFESSOR ROUX
But you are aware of the
connotation of the word spook

COLEMAN
(emphatic)
Ghost I was referring to her
ectoplasmic character

He opens his dictionary to the marked page -

COLEMAN
(continuing)
Heres the first definition of the
word Spook 1 Informal a
ghost specter

ANOTHER FACULTY MEMBER
Dean Silk let me read you the
second dictionary meaning
(reading)
Disparaging A Negro

COLEMAN

(leaning forward

speaking

emphatically but

with care)
I had never laid eyes on them how
could I know they were black
What I did know was that they were
invisible

PROFESSOR ROUX
(awkward pause)
Nevertheless they have lodged a
complaint Miss Cummings was
deva-

COLEMAN
(cutting her off)
These students have not attended
a single class Do they exist or
are they spooks Consider the
context
8 8

COLEMAN (contd)
The only issue is the
nonattendance of these students
their inexcusable neglect of work
and their sheer chutzpah To
charge me with racism is not only
false it is spectacularly false

Satisfied with his rebuttal Coleman rises and leaves the
room HOLD ON the faculty sitting in silence

NATHANS VOICE OVER
However it wasnt going to be that
easy

9 INT IRIS SILKS OFFICE IN COLEMANS HOUSE - DAY 9

IRIS
They what

IRIS Colemans wife a vital woman with a mane of crinkly
salt and pepper fly-away hair always threatening to burst
the confines of bands pins combs and pencils she thrusts
into it She wears an ethnic but chic print dress and lots
of folkloric jewelry

Her office in their home is almost as much of a rats nest as
her hair bespeaking her many civic and aesthetic activities-

COLEMAN
Accused me of quote employing a
racist epithet Unquote

IRIS
What epithet

COLEMAN
Spook Fifty years ago it was
slang for-

IRIS
(cutting him off)
I know what it was slang for
(then )
Thats absurd Did you remind them
that when you were Dean you hired
the first black -

COLEMAN
(hasty irony)
African American--
9 9

IRIS
Hired the first African American
ever on the faculty What about
Herb Keble Hes on the committee
isnt he Herb and Edith are
friends of ours for Gods sake
Didnt Herb open his mouth

COLEMAN
Oh yes
(a withering
imitation of Herbs
sonorous voice)
Im sorry Coleman I cant be
with you on this

CLOSER ON IRIS--outraged at the injustice

IRIS

Well well fight them Well
organize My God what a
travesty - after thirty-five years
of devoted

(interrupting herself)
Well start a petition drive
thats what well

(racing ahead of

herself)
Well get a lawyer Well
counterattack--

THE CAMERA HOLDS ON IRIS as she continues but the voice
slows down and deepens moving out of sync with the image--
like a record slowing down after the power has been shut off

IRIS
(continuing)
Ive got friends among the-

QUICK CUT OF COLEMAN--as he realizes something is horribly
wrong

COLEMAN
(a cry)
Iris

VERY TIGHT ON IRIS--as she looks toward her husband a look
of utter terror on her face She knows she is about to die

We slowly FADE TO BLACK
NATHANS VOICE OVER

No it certainly wasnt going to
be that easy
10 INT NATHAN ZUCKERMANS CABIN BERKSHIRES - DAY 10

CLOSE ON A DESK cluttered with yellow legal pads pencils a
computer In the distance we hear the sound of a television
set

NATHANS VOICE OVER
Four hours later Iris Silk died
in Colemans arms It was after
that that Coleman came into my
life

THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN PAST a cup filled with old coffee
half a sandwich stacks of books etc etc The impression
chaos which hasnt been touched to REVEAL NATHAN ZUCKERMAN
(early 40s) staring at the TV his is the voice we have
been hearing Light flickers on his expressionless face
Then from 0S We hear the sound of someone banging on a
door Nathan Zuckerman pays no attention We HEAR applause
from the TV The banging on the door becomes more insistent
Nathan reluctantly gets to his feet-

NATHAN
(yelling)
Im comingIm coming

ON THE DOOR he opens it cautiously

NATHANS POV Coleman Silk wearing chinos and a sweater
What we notice immediately is that there is a ferocious
intensity about the man a fire of what just might be madness
in his eyes

COLEMAN
Zuckerman Nathan Zuckerman
NATHAN
(suspicious)
Yeah
COLEMAN

(he charges inside
without being asked)
Weve got to talk

NATHAN
Im afraid--

ON COLEMAN--He turns on Nathan suddenly suspicious
COLEMAN

You are the Zuckerman thats the
writer Correct

NATHAN
Yeah but--

COLEMAN
Your last book won some sort of
prize right

NATHAN
(starting to get
pissed)
It was short listed for the--

COLEMAN
That was five years ago what
happened
(not waiting for an
answer)

Blocked Right Youre blocked
worried you dont have another
story in you Well I can fix that
Im the answer to your prayers
You know who I am

NATHAN
(intrigued at the
very least)

Dean Silk

COLEMAN

Dean Coleman Silk thats right
the late retired and now resigned
and unlamented Dean Silk
following the MURDER did you
clock that -MURDER of my wife

(faces him)
Hows that grab you Zuckerman
Good enough to get your juices
flowing Huh

NATHAN
Im not sure I under-

Throughout the following Coleman paces around the room
pausing sometimes to pick up something only to immediately
put it down Occasionally he sits only to jump to his feet
almost immediately and resume his pacing

COLEMAN

Those sons of bitches killed my
wife Nathan--you dont mind if I
call you Nathan

(not waiting for an

answer)
They killed her as sure as if they
had taken a gun and fired it into
her heart Who would have thought
Iris couldnt take it 10
COLEMAN (contd)
(reflective)
Strong as she was brave as she

was

(back to Nathan)
But their kind of stupidity was
too much even for a juggernaut
like Iris Massive embolism I got
her to the hospital but it was ©
too late

(fixing Nathan with

a look)
The point is they meant to kill
me and they got her instead all
in the name of political
correctness--an oxymoron if I ever
heard one

(pleased with himself)
Theres your book Zuckerman

NATHAN
Look Dean -
COLEMAN
Coleman just Coleman All my

other titles I have given away -

NATHAN
Lookah Coleman I can see
youre devastated And Im sorry
really sorry But I write fiction--

COLEMAN

(cutting him off)
Believe me this thing will read
like The Manchurian Candidate -
they murdered the wrong person
for Chrissakes and for what One
word Spooks Let me tell you
something Nathan

(confidentially)
My father was a saloon keeper in
New Jersey--the only Jewish
saloonkeeper in East Orange He
only got as far as the seventh
grade but he insisted on the
precision of words and I have kept
faith with him

(as though convincing

himself)
I have kept faith with him

Coleman has run out of steam for the moment

Flops onto the

ratty sofa as Nathan studies him Then cautiously -

10 10

NATHAN
If you dont mind a suggestion
maybe you ought to write this book
yourself

Coleman considers this

COLEMAN
Maybe so Maybe I should at that
(then looking around
the room )
Youre divorced right

NATHAN
Does it show

COLEMAN
Nathan you have the look about
you of a man at loose ends
(sighs)
Takes one to know one

NATHAN
Whats the moment called in Greek
tragedy - you know the one where
the hero learns that everything he
knows is wrong

COLEMAN
Peripeteia

NATHAN
(rueful)
Thats me

TIGHT ON COLEMAN--He smiles - different from the killer grin

- Open

COLEMAN
Nathan by any chance do you play
Gin Rummy

NATHANS VOICE OVER
And that was how our friendship
began
Over this we HEAR STOMPIN AT THE SAVOY
11 EXT COLEMANS HOUSE - NIGHT
A big white rambling home with lights on and MUSIC

blasting from within The screened-in porch is lit up
tooand inside we can see two FIGURES playing cards

INT COLEMANS SCREEN-IN PORCH - NIGHT 12

ON A PING PONG TABLE with a computer that is stacked high
with papers THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS TO COLEMAN AND NATHAN
playing gin-rummy while drinking BEER from bottles

ON COLEMAN--studying his hand

COLEMAN
(nonchalant)
Why did you and your wife split up

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM

NATHAN
Which wife--the first or the
second

That gets Colemans attention

NATHAN
(continuing grins)
You sure you want to discard that

We HEAR Ella Fitzgerald singing But Not For Me as we CUT TO
INT LIVING ROOM COLEMANS HOUSE - DAY 13

CLOSE ON A PHOTOGRAPH OF IRIS SILK--It is a black and white
photograph we see her carrying a placard that reads
Freedom of Choice And this is obviously a rally ata
womens clinic because she is yelling at someone OS She
looks both alive and vital beautiful and plain angry and
thoroughly happy all at the same time It sits on the
mantelpiece surrounded by other photographs of his family

WE REVERSE ON NATHAN--He takes the photograph from the
mantle so that he can study it more carefully Over this we
HEAR

COLEMANS VOICE OVER
Forty years we were married

ON THE DOOR LEADING FROM THE KITCHEN INTO THE LIVING ROOM --
coleman in khakis and an oxford cloth button down shirt
frayed around the collar and shirt tail hanging out stands
in the doorway holding two bottles of beer

COLEMAN
Add on the six months we lived
together Thats not bad -
especially these days

NATHAN
(sympathetic)
You must have loved her very much

13 13
COLEMAN
After forty years who could tell
NATHAN
Kids
COLEMAN

Jeff and Michael - both married
now tenured professors out in
California And then theres Mark
the thorn in my side Marky for
whom nothing was ever quite good
enough
(sighs)
Hes an orthodox Jew lives with
a dental technician in Queens
who supports him while he writes
long angry unpublishable poetry
(picking up the
photograph of his
daughter smiling)
And theres my Lisa shes in New
York teaches remedial reading

Coleman studies the photograph of Lisa a moment longer - then
puts it down as the music changes again Dick Haymes is
singing Where or When

INT SCREENED IN PORCH - NIGHT 14

Once more we see the computer if anything there are more
papers piled on the ping pong table THE CAMERA PANS ACROSS
TO NATHAN AND COLEMAN The gin rummy game continues both men
whooping with hilarity as they slam down their cards Nathan
steals a look at the ping-pong table - it is now COVERED with
documents boxes more files

Nathan glances back and sees Coleman has caught his look

COLEMAN
Hey youre the guy that threw
away a chance at the Pulitzer not
me

ON NATHAN--not fazed in the least he smiles lays down his
cards

NATHAN
Gin

15 INTEXT PORCH - ANOTHER EVENING 15

As Nathan takes a pull from the bottle of beer nods toward
the ping-pong table its empty On the floor a lot of FILE
BOXES crammed with papers

NATHAN
Whats with the book
COLEMAN
The book has come and gone
NATHAN
Meaning
(he nudges a box with
a toe)
Meaning its worthless You cant

make a college without breaking
egg-heads and I couldnt write a
book called Spooks that didnt
sound like a lunatic raving All
this

(nodding towards the

cartons of papers)
Useless unless you count the
dubious thrill of re-reading old
love letters

He takes several letters that he has obviously just been re-
reading and drops them on top of one of the boxes

TIGHTER IN as a photograph falls out of one of the envelopes
ON NATHAN--as he leans down and picks it up

HIS POV INSERT OF THE PHOTOGRAPH--It is a snapshot taken in
the late forties by a street photographer It shows the young
Coleman Silk his dark hair is closely cropped (in what used
to be called a GI cut) he wears a tweed jacket oxford
cloth button down shirt (not dissimilar to the one he is
wearing now) crew necked sweater He is walking down the
street with a stunningly beautiful blonde girl their arms
around one another laughing However what we notice most is
that the girl looks at him with total adoration

ON NATHAN--looking from the photograph to Coleman

NATHAN
This you

COLEMAN
(wry)
Hey I was young once

NATHAN
Thats not what I meant Whos the
girl
COLEMAN
(taking the
photograph)

Her names Steena Paulsen She was
from Minnesota

NATHAN
(with a look)
Forgive me Coleman but you dont
seem to me to be the Minnesota
type

COLEMAN

(with a laugh)
There are depths about me young
man you will never plumb

(then quickly)
I met Steena when I was at NYU on
the GI bill Almost married her

(a beat)
What would my life have been like
if I had

As Coleman is talking Bewitched Bothered and Bewildered

starts to

play on the radio

COLEMAN

(continuing he stops

for a beat savoring

the music)
ListenI hear that and
everything within me unclenches
and the wish not to die never to
die is almost too great to bear

(then )
Come on lets dance

NATHAN
(taken aback)
What

COLEMAN
Dance You and me Dont worry
Nathan Im not making a pass
Come on live a little

NATHAN
Alright but just dont sing in my
ear okay

15 15
And the two men start to dance

NATHAN
(continuing)
You seem pretty cheerful for a man
whose book just tanked

COLEMAN
(a beat then)
Im having an affair Nathan

NATHAN
No kidding

COLEMAN
No kiddingIm having an affair
with a thirty-four-year-old woman
I cant tell you what its done to

me
NATHAN
Im getting a pretty good idea
COLEMAN
(with great
simplicity)

I thought I couldnt take any more
of anything Butwhen this stuff
comes back solate in life
(thoughtfully)
Completely unexpected completely
unwanted it comes back at you
with such force andwhen theres
nothing you can do about it when
theres nothing to dilute it

NATHAN
And when shes thirty-four

COLEMAN

(grins)
And ignitable Nathan Ignitable
Ever hear of something called
Viagra Without it I would still
have the dignity befitting a man
my age and position Without it I
could continue in my declining
years to draw profound
philosophical conclusions and have
a steadying moral influence on the
young

15 15

COLEMAN (contd)
Without Viagra I would not be
doing something that makes no
sense something that is ill
considered and potentially
disastrous for all involved

NATHAN
So exactly where did you find La
Belle Dame sans Merci

dignity in her gaze

COLEMAN

dollars in the mason jar on the
top

COLEMAN
Fine

Nevertheless he doesnt move

CLOSE ON FAUNIA IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES WE SEE Faunia
gently but firmly shoving the cows into position We see her
attaching the cups to the cows teats and massaging the
udders There are patches of sweat between her shoulder
blades and beneath her breasts Her shorts are ripped along
the side and we note that she isnt wearing underwear This
is all powerfully erotic without being premeditated in the
least Coleman watches mesmerized All through this she is
talking to him

FAUNIA
Come on Daisy After I left
Boston I was in Florida for a
while doing this and that

32 32

FAUNIA (contd)
A girl like me can always get by

AGE

NELSON PRIMUSS VOICE OVER
Everyone knows youre exploiting
an abused illiterate woman half
your age

REVERSE ON NELSON PRIMUS Colemans attorney an amiable
fellow in his thirties he wears a suit that hints of Ralph
Lauren more than Brooks Brothers Nelson rapidly rereads the
letter mumbling the words together-

NELSON
Everyone knows youre exploiting
an abused illiterate woman half
your age

A grim smile as he sets aside the letter and looks 0OS

NELSON
(continuing)
Well if this doesnt take the
cake-

CROSS-CUT TO COLEMAN--pacing back and forth in front of his
attorneys desk

COLEMAN
Thats not all my kids have even
got wind of it

NELSON
You dont say

COLEMAN
Whats more I know damn well who
wrote this - Delphine Roux

NELSON
Who

COLEMAN
Professor of Languages and
Literature
(irate)
I hired her for Christs sake I
hired all of them

NELSON
Why would she send you something
like this

COLEMAN
Ive no idea How should I know
Youre my lawyer I want you to
send her a letter and warn her off

NELSON
Shell just deny she ever -

COLEMAN
Thats her writing Any
handwriting expert would con-

NELSON
Youre being hasty -

COLEMAN
No No Im not -

NELSON
Yes you are same as when you
resigned from the college just as
the whole Spooks thing was on
the point of blowing over I told
you then -

COLEMAN
And I told you they killed my
wife What else could I-

NELSON
Coleman Slow down SIT

Reluctantly Coleman obeys Nelson studies him

NELSON
(continuing)
Listen to me professor Forget
about the letter You got bigger
fish to fry What are you going to
do about Lester Farley
44 COLEMAN
Get a restraining order an
injunction I dont know

NELSON

A restraining order Have you any
idea what youre getting into
here Coleman What it looks like
from the outside

(leaning back in his

chair)

After thirty-some years of
academic distinction ina
community you virtually created
from scratch suddenly youve gone
off the deep end You want me to
fight a legal war for you on two
fronts - one of them with a
phantom correspondent and the
other with a psychotic whos been
locked up twice in the mental ward
at the VA hospital in Northampton
under real restraints not legal
ones

Before Coleman can get in a word -

NELSON

(continuing)
Sure I can get a restraining
order but will that restrain him
I can get you a handwriting
expert I can get you a
bulletproof vest But what I cant
provide is what youre never going
to know as long as youre involved
with this woman a scandal-free
Farley-free life Is she HIV
negative by the way Did you
have her tested Coleman Did you
use a condom Coleman And if you
dont use protection does SHE
How do you know she doesnt want
to use you to help make up for
what shes lost Do I represent
you in the paternity suit Coleman

COLEMAN
I can handle Lester if I have to-

NELSON
But why do you have to Give up
the girl Achilles

Coleman looks up at him - hes pale with fury

COLEMAN
(stiffening)
I beg your pardon

NELSON

(grins)
I took your intro to European lit
umpteen years ago as an undergrad
Never forgot your lectures on
Homer Achilles listen to me you
have to give up the girl Give
her up and your troubles go away
Im speaking as your friend as
well as your attorney Faunia
Farley is not in your league and
shes not from your world Last
night you got a good look at her
world - Coleman the fact is she
aint worth it

(a amiable smile)
Achilles on Viagra - how much
sense does that make anyway

speaks it is with deadly quiet -

The tone gives Nelson pause

And with that he turns and stalks out

COLEMAN
Are you quite finished

COLEMAN
(continuing)
Youre a genuine vocal master
Nelson And so rich with contempt
for every last human problem
youve never had to face

NELSON
Listen I was only -

COLEMAN
You listen I never again want to
hear that self-admiring voice of
yours - or see your smug lily
white face

tablecloths Mr Silk among them carrying an overloaded
TRAY

DINER
Boy this fish is overcooked

MR SILK
Sorry sir

DINER

He picks up the mans plate puts it on the laden tray along
with food glasses and utensils starts back to the galley -

Suddenly he collapses bringing down dishes with a CRASH
that startles everyone in the dining car

EXT EAST ORANGE CEMETERY - DAY 51
A dreary spot A knot of MOURNERS across from Mr Silks

At first we dont know where we are Then a DOOR is opened
revealing a SILHOUETTE -

MRS SILK
Coleman

COLEMAN
Leave it offPlease

MRS SILK
Alright

She closes the door and walks tentatively towards Coleman
who lies in his bed Gradually our eyes become accustomed to
the dark his mother sits on the edge of the bed

Shes in her crisp starched white NURSES UNIFORM -

COLEMAN

MRS SILK

COLEMAN

I never knew him Not really I

through Every

(on the verge of

saying godamned

but checks himself

in front of his

mother)
-Single day

MRS SILK
I dont believe he wanted you to
know dear He couldnt see the
point

COLEMAN
I can see the point The point is

matter how much you know you work
in the dining car Thats the
point

MRS SILK
Coleman if its your education

fathers insurance and your own
academic record will see to it
that you get into Howard

COLEMAN
Mom Howard isnt ‘a real
university Howards no different
from East Orange

MRS SILK

Coleman
COLEMAN

(he must make himself

heard despite the

cost)
I heard all about Howard from
Walt He said theyre always
talking about the negro people
About We the negro people Mom

MRS SILK
Your father wanted you to know who
you were to be proud of your race

COLEMAN
(with passion)

MRS SILK
Coleman your father wanted the
best for you He--

52 52

COLEMAN

around her)

Was more worried about Lester
Farley
COLEMAN
I dont want to talk about Lester
Farley
NATHAN

(hands him the glass)
What DO you want to talk about
You show up here all in a lather -

Silence as Coleman struggles with his emotions
Nathan studies him then softly -

NATHAN
(continuing)
Listen I was at the post office
this morning I heard people
saying you got Faunia Farley
pregnant that she had an abortion
and tried to kill herself--

COLEMAN
cutting him off)
Did they add shes an opium eater
while they were at it And dont
forget the best part shes an
illiterate woman

54 54

NATHAN
Coleman I know its bullshit Im
your friend remember -

Coleman bangs down the glass of ice tea -

COLEMAN
Then act like it

NATHAN
Coleman dont take these people
on
(gesturing toward the
television where the
impeachment hearings
are playing)
Theyre all crazy to blame crazy
to punish-

COLEMAN
So I just throw her to the wolves
(Realizes)
Shes waiting for that To her
sex and betrayal are as basic as
bread

NATHAN
Im not thinking about her Im
thinking about you

But Coleman is cranking up

COLEMAN

Christ my own kids - I never
allowed any of them to watch TV
and they manifest the mentality of
a soap opera The best schools
superior SAT scores post graduate
degrees and where their fathers
concerned Jerry Springer is the
best they can do - Dont be

like them
NATHAN
(helpless)
I dont know what you want me to
say
COLEMAN

I want you to acknowledge that
something important is taking
place between me and this woman -
something worthy of respect
Dont judge me

54 54

COLEMAN (contd)
And for heavens sake dont judge
her

Nathan is flummoxed having trouble following

NATHAN
Shes - what are you telling me
Shes the love of your life

COLEMAN
Okay look granted shes not my
first love and granted shes not
my Great Love okay But shes
sure as hell my Last Love Isnt
that worth something Isnt it

Undismayed and naked Faunia stubs out the cigarette gets
out of bed and undulates to sultry Gershwin

COLEMAN
This is more than sex
FAUNIA
No its not You just forgot

what sex is Dont fuck it up by
pretending its something else

STAY with Coleman watching not a depleted old man but a
lover Faunias performance darkly reflected in an antique
oval MIRROR above the head of the bed just over Coleman

She dances

He watches A connection between them Faunia is not self
conscious

55 55

Her movements are small not dancing really rather
rhythmically exhibiting herself in tiny gestures for him
Then in a series of slow dissolves as THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON
HER

FAUNIA
(continuing)
Dont fall in love with me

COLEMAN
Keep dancing
FAUNIA
(dancing)
Youre falling in love Look at

COLEMAN

INT MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT 56

CLOSE ON a beautiful young girl (STEENA) she is blond and
cannot be more than nineteen Hers is the FACE we saw in the

The war is over and hundreds of
thousands of American soldiers

REVERSE ON THE NEWSREEL shes watching -

ED HERLIHY
Sailors and airmen are returning
to a grateful nation where thanks
to Uncle Sam a college education
awaits courtesy of the GI Bill

As the newsreel about the GI bill continues We CUT TO

COLEMAN SILK now 21 wearing a tweed jacket and looking very
collegiate He sits several rows behind Steena his eyes
fixed on her Then just as he is about to make a move toward
her three young women crowd in on either side of Steena and
they all begin whispering and giggling among themselves
Reluctantly Coleman gets to his feet and starts up the aisle
of the theater throwing one last look over his shoulder
towards the girl as he does

INT STACKS NYU LIBRARY - DAY 57

ON COLEMAN--He moves through the stacks carrying a couple of
books clearly searching for another He pauses about to
remove a book from the shelf when he looks OS

HIS POV In the distance we get a glimpse of the beautiful
blond girl we saw in the movie theater She instantly
disappears and for a moment Coleman isnt sure whether what
he saw was real or an apparition

CLOSER ON COLEMAN (TRACKING WITH HIM)--he instantly starts in
hot pursuit of the girl

57
As he reaches the end of the row he stops looks around

HIS POV-At first there is no sign of the blond Then he
spots her disappearing into another row of books

ON COLEMAN (AGAIN TRACKING WITH HIM) as he ducks into another
row of books moving parallel with her intending to head her
off

COLEMANS POV (TRACKING SHOT) looking though the shelves we
get a glimpse of the blond several rows away Once again she
disappears

ON COLEMAN-brushing past a browser in the stacks

COLEMAN
Excuse me

Throughout this we are continually CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN
COLEMAN AND HIS POV OF THE GIRL (never getting more than
glimpses of her)

ON COLEMAN as he rounds a corner and stops dead in his tracks

HIS POV There is the blond she stands not far away her
back to him still intent on the book she is reading

TIGHT ON COLEMAN--There is a half smile on his lips the same
half smile we saw in the boxing ring

TIGHTER ON THE BLOND--Her back is still to us

COLEMANS VOICE OVER

realize that she really is that beautiful

INT COLEMANS GREENWICH VILLAGE APT - DAY 58

ON THE DOOR--as it is unlocked and Coleman brings the blond
in

BLOND

COLEMAN
One cup of coffee thats all I
promise Library stays open til

As he leads her inside we see his apartment for the first
time It is an attractive one room apartment with a simple
fireplace and a kitchenette off to one side

58 58

The walls are white there are reproductions of Paul Klee and
Chagall The bookshelves are one by eights with bricks at
each end serving as risers There are books everywhere on
every surface on the table we see a pair of boxing gloves
(not the kind you use in the ring but lighter ones the kind
fighters use for work on the heavy bag) The bed has been
carefully made dishes put away the impression we get is one
of order and neatness

STEENA
GI bill pays for all this

ON COLEMAN--as he begins fixing coffee
COLEMAN

near NYU THE CAMERA MOVES WITH STEENA AND COLEMAN as they
their arms around one another

walk

STREET - DAY

STEENA
So all Im saying is that Achilles
is the first real individual in
all of western litera--

COLEMAN

(shakes his head)
Not a chance

(grins)
Look Achilles succumbed to to
group pressure right I mean he
gave up the girl - a girl he
really wanted - so the Greeks
could keep going with the Trojan
war He gave in to group pressure

STEENA
From which you conclude what -
that groups are -

COLEMAN
How tall are you

STEENA
Is this the same conversation

60 60
COLEMAN
Id say you were maybe five ten
right
STEENA
Where is this le-
COLEMAN
Did you play basketball in high
school
STEENA
Sure
COLEMAN
And I bet you were good
STEENA
Well I -
COLEMAN

But let me ask you this Did you
want to play

STEENA
Did I -

COLEMAN
In America if youre a girl and
youre five ten they make you play
basketball Its a given They
dont ask if you want to play if
youre interested in the game
Height equals fate You play
You do what the group says

STEENA
I like basketball

COLEMAN
What if it were something you
didnt like Say all girls over
five ten had to shave their heads

They are both laughing Steena turns and looks at Coleman
with a look of total adoration

STEENA
Oh God Coleman I think Im in
love with you

At that moment we HEAR a click The picture freezes and turns
to black and white It is the snapshot Nathan Zuckerman saw
in Colemans house earlier

60 60

ON A STREET PHOTOGRAPHER--He has just taken the photograph we
saw earlier in the scene with Nathan The one Coleman has
kept all these years and now we know why

STREET PHOTOGRAPHER
(handing Coleman a
card)
Picture of you and your sweetheart
for a dollar

As Coleman happily digs in his pocket we HEAR Dick Haymes
singing Our Love Is Here To Stay

61 INT RECORD STORE - DAY 61

It is in the days when LPs and 45s first came out there are
bins filled with hit singles Dick Haymes continues to sing
as we see Steena and Coleman in a listening booth Coleman
comes out to look for another record as Steena remains in the
booth continuing to listen to a record THE CAMERA PANS AHEAD
OF HIM TO REVEAL a very pretty young salesgirl she is a
coffee colored African American Her name is ELLIE and she
watches Coleman with interest We move with her as she
crosses to a bin where Coleman is flipping through 78s

ELLIE
Can I help you

COLEMAN
(glancing up)
I waslooking for Edith Piaf
La Vie un Rose

ELLIE
This way

THE CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM--she walks very close to him so
that they brush against one another

ELLIE
(continuing innocent)
Have you heard the new Louis
Armstrong

COLEMAN

62 INT COLEMANS APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON COLEMAN AND STEENA--in a passionate embrace as they
come up for air Although The Man I Love continues to play
we are close enough to Coleman and Steena to be aware of

their breathing

COLEMAN
(a whisper)
Dance for me

CLOSER ON STEENA--She steps away looking Coleman in the eye

for a long long beat as she comes to a decision

Then with

the arest trace of a smile she removes first one earring and

then the other

She begins a languid undulating motion as she takes
Colemans hand opens it and drops the two earrings into his
palm Then continuing the slow rhythmic movements begins to

undress slowly

This should be a very different Steena from the girl who

first walked into Colemans apartment some deep

erotic part

of her has been unlocked and at moments she displays a way of
moving that is uncannily like Faunias In a series of SLOW
DISSOLVES we watch as she strips to the sensual music of

Gershwin

62

By the end when she has removed her last undergarment and
dances in front of Coleman absolutely naked the record comes
to an end and we hear the scratching of the needle of the
record player on vinyl It is as though at that moment she
comes out of a trance She immediately puts her hands to her
face to cover her embarrasment

REVERSE ON COLEMAN

COLEMAN
(continuing)
That has got to be the single most
sexy dance ever to be danced by a
girl from Fergus Falls in the
history of the world

ON STEENA--her hands remain covering her face both mortally
embarrassed and profoundly exhilarated

STEENA
Oh God Coleman I love you I
want to spend my life with you

COLEMAN
What are you doing Sunday

CLOSER ON STEENA--She lowers her hands from her face

STEENA
(in answer to the
question we heard
the older Coleman
ask)

INT SILK DINING ROOM NJ - NIGHT 65
Coleman his mother and Steena at dinner - the dining room
looks a little empty with only three As she speaks Steena

seems to be breathing in all the wrong places

Mrs Silk is wise enough to understand what her son has not
told Steena therefore she does everything in her power to
make this poor girl more comfortable

65

STEENA

A caesura in her breathless delivery Steena looking
pathetically around then -

MRS SILK

like another biscuit

Steenas look of gratitude

STEENA

Coleman and Steena virtually alone in the chair car heading
back for the city Steena leans against the window silent

staring out into the night Coleman sits next to her
watching her carefully holding her hand

COLEMAN

Silence then with the screeching of brakes the train pulls

to a stop The conductor (black) walks through the car

announcing Penn Station the final stop The people get up

and leave the car still Steena doesnt move

CLOSE ON STEENA--as she turns to Coleman we see for the
first time that she has been crying She looks at him for a
long beat just shaking her head

STEENA

Im sorry Coleman II love you
but--

(she breaks off)
I cant Im really sorry but

(shaking her head)

And without another word blind with tears she flees
Coleman doesnt go after her He just sits there Alone

As we FADE TO BLACK we hear the roar of a crowd

INT ST NICHOLAS ARENA - NIGHT 67

WIDE SHOT--of the crows still relatively sparse since it is
the first or decond match of the evening THE CAMERA PANS
ACROSS TO THE RING where an AFRICAN AMERICAN BOXER waits
bouncing up and down throwing punches at the air

REVERSE ON THE YOUNG COLEMAN as he climbs through the ropes
along with his CORNERMAN who is African- American SOLLY a
small time fight promoter who manages Coleman climbs up
leans in and whispers to Coleman

SOLLY
Hey SilkyTake it easy with the
nigger okay Lets give the
people their moneys worth

Coleman stares OS at the fighter his face a mask

SOLLY
(continuing smiling)
Dance him around for three four
rounds then go to work

The bell sounds Coleman moves into the ring more rapidly
than usual The formalities over the men begin to feel one
another out We notice that the usual smile is gone from
Colemans face it has been replaced by a look of grim
determination

After one or two punches Coleman nails his opponent with a
right cross and then methodically begins to pound the black
fighter knocking him out before the round is half way over
There are boos from the crowd

INT COLEMANS READY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 68

Colemans African American cornerman stripping off his
gloves gear as Solly returns studies Coleman who doesnt
look up-

SOLLY

star handsome He crackles with sexual electricity

casually dressed The pianist stops almost mid-phrase as a
violinst comes over to him and the two men begin to discuss
the music in whispers Over this we HEAR

NATHANS VOICE OVER
I had been both missing Coleman
and missing the experience of
having an intimate friend

ON THE AUDIENCE--a handful of people dressed as casually as
the performers are scattered around the concert hall used for
chamber groups Behind them through a large opening we can
see the Berkshires in the distance

empty seats (some of which have sweaters draped over the back
to mark them as occupied) looking for a chair Meanwhile the

As he hurries her away into the crowd we HEAR

78 78

NATHANS VOICE OVER
I tried to use my imagination -
not to speculate where they went
That wasnt hard But rather to
ponder what their mutual rage had
made of them outcasts alone
together they were now stripped
down to the simplest version of
themselves With nothing between
them and their destiny

ON A STAINED GLASS WINDOW

NATHANS VOICE OVER
By contrast to Faunias funeral
Colemans was stage managed to the
nth degree by his family This was
to be Colemans formal
rehabilitation into the Athena
College pantheon of heroes -and
Colemans children had spared no
pains to get out the vote They
had even found a sacrificial lamb

PAN DOWN FROM to Herb Keeble as he mounts the pulpit There
is a beat of silence

HERB

(quietly)
My name is Herbert Keble I am
chairman of the Political Science
Department - and I was among those

defense when he was accused of
racism

Throughout this we CROSS CUT TO THE SILK PEW - where
Colemans children sit Jeff Mark (wearing a yarmulke) and

Coleman I cant be with you on
this That is what I said to my

everlasting shame Oh I had my
reasons I thought I could help
better behind the scenes If I
allied myself publicly I told
myself I risked being labeled an
Uncle Tom and thereby useless I
was wrong JI should never have
said to my friend I cant be
with you on this I should have
said I MUST be with you on
this I should have spoken up to
say what I want to say now in the
presence of his former colleagues
and especially in the presence of
his children that the alleged
misconduct never took place
Coleman Silk and his wife Iris
were betrayed by the moral
stupidity of a censorious
coercive community and I was a
member of that community We all
were

IRIS SILK 1934-1998 COLEMAN SILK 1930-

Nathan remains lost in thought as people disappear around
him Only gradually is he aware

Theres a WOMAN perhaps 62 still standing by the grave
primly holding her purse a blank expression on her face

She is a light-skinned African American

NATHAN
Mrs Keble
(she looks at him)
I believe your husbands eulogy
changed everything today

The woman turns to him

WOMAN
Im not Mrs Keble

TIGHT ON NATHAN as he slowly realizes -

NATHAN
YoureAre you Colemans sister

MADAMASKA INN - LATER

Nathan and Ernestine are sitting in the lounge of a quaint
country inn

TIGHT ON THE HAND OF A WAITER--as he serves them tea

NATHAN
Lemon or milk
ERNESTINE
Milk
(then

That day Walter told Coleman never
to contact mother again - he froze
everything forever

NATHAN
Your mother obeyed Walter

ERNESTINE

All the Silk men from my father on
down are very decisive Mr
Zuckerman Yes she did But I
didnt Id phone Coleman on his
birthday things like that I
was trying to reach him two days
ago his seventieth birthday
the day after he was killed

(realizes)
I must have spoken to one of my
nephews-—

she looks away for

a moment then

regaining her

composure)
I dont blame Walter he was
trying to spare my mother more
heartache

NATHAN
Did he succeed

ERNESTINE
When she died in the hospital she
was delirious

ERNESTINE (contd)
She kept saying Oh nurse get me
to the train I got a sick baby at
home Over and over Walter
and I knew who that sick baby was

NATHAN
Is Walter still alive

ERNESTINE

Oh yes Were all a family of
teachers Mr Zuckerman imagine
Even Colemans side of the
family -I wish our parents had
known that And Walter was the
first colored superintendant of
schools in the state of New Jersey

(smiles)
I guess you can tell what
generation I am - I say colored
and Negro

NATHAN
Did you know why your brother
resigned from the college

ERNESTINE
I gather he was accused of racism
(smiles sadly)
That beats all doesnt it

NATHAN
For using the word spooks

ERNESTINE
Sounds like from what Ive heard
today that anything is possible
nowadays People are just getting
dumber - but more opinionated
The year I retired youngsters
were telling me that for Black
History Month they would only read
a biography of a black BY a black
What kind of silly idea is Black
History Month anyway If youre
going to study Charles Drew you
do him when you do science
dont segregate him in Black
History Month for heavens sake

NATHAN
Im afraid I dont know who
Charles Drew is

96 96

ERNESTINE
Shame on you Mr Zuckerman Dr
Charles Drew discovered how to
prevent blood from clotting so it
could be banked Then he was
injured in a car accident and the
nearest hospital would not take
colored so he bled to death

Silence as Nathan contemplates this She looks at him -

ERNESTINE

(continuing)
You know whats sad Mr
Zuckerman Nowadays its
impossible to imagine anyone doing
what my brother felt he had to do
then constructing his whole
life around a lie He could have
stopped that racism charge in its
tracks - I wonder if that solution
even occurred to him Tell me
something Mr Zuckerman Did he
ever acknowledge what hed done
To anyone

CLOSE ON NATHAN--He is silent for a long beat

NATHAN
No I dont think so I dont
think he did

ERNESTINE

(a rueful smile)
So he was Coleman until the end
Set out to do something and do it
all the way Even to the point of
being buried as Jew

(sadly)
Oh Coleman

She stands Nathan stands as well
ERNESTINE
(continuing)
Well Its been quite a day
THE CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they start towards the door

NATHAN
Are you going to tell Walter

ERNESTINE
Not unless he asks
96 96

NATHAN
What about Colemans children
ERNESTINE
It was for Coleman to tell them
not me
NATHAN
But you told me
ERNESTINE
No you said Youre Colemans
sister and I admitted it Im

not the one with something to hide
ERNESTINE
(continuing she
extends a hand)
Thank you for your hospitality
NATHAN
May I come and visit you in New
Jersey Id very much like to meet
Walter

ERNESTINE
Let me think about it

And she walks out the door
INT NATHANS CAR - DUSK 97
Nathan driving carefully lost in thought Abruptly he reacts-

HIS POV - PARKED BY THE ROADSIDE A SNOW-COVERED RED
PICKUP

Nathan studies the car slows down Stops

Gets out - the middle of nowhere on a chilly twilight Nathan
walks around the truck studying it the murder weapon

On the rear bumper MIAPOW

FOOTSTEPS in the SNOW lead into the woods

Nathan looks around hesitates decides to follow them
EXT WOODS - TWILIGHT 98

SEVERAL ANGLES - Nathan making his way cautiously through the
whiteness of trees until he comes out onto -

99 EXT FROZEN LAKE - TWILIGHT 99

As Nathan emerges from the woods looking

NATHANS POV - a stunning vista of white the LAKE is
frozen over No signs of civilization but-

In the middle of the lake a lone FIGURE sits on an upturned
yellow BUCKET hunched over a HOLE in the ice a fishing line
in his hands LESTER dressed in black wool CAP pulled down
over his forehead and ears heavy overalls boots etc

Nathan doesnt move But the FIGURE sees him Now or never
Nathans expression of fear and determination

CLOSE NATHANS FOOT steps gingerly onto the ice It HOLDS
Then his OTHER FOOT The feet start walking

LOW POV - Nathans FEET the figure of Lester getting CLOSER
Finally Nathans feet stop twenty feet away from him

LES
(doesnt look up)
Youre on thin ice

The men look at one another

NATHAN
Id say we both are Fish biting

LES
Not too good not too bad

He glances away Nathan does too and perceives several neat
CIRCULAR HOLES dug randomly in the ice -

AND A FOUR FOOT METAL SHAFT ending in a CORKSCREW BLADE a
lethal-looking AUGER rotated by the cranked handle on top

Nathans glance up from the deadly tool bumps into Les eyes

NATHAN
Beautiful spot

LES
Why Im here

NATHAN
Peaceful

LES

Away from all the craziness Im
out of it

(steals another

glance)
Long as I can keep it secret

NATHAN
True enough Only now I know

Les glances up again then back at his fishing line-

LES
You look like a man who can keep
a secret Arent you the writer

NATHAN
What do you think about if the
fish arent biting

He doesnt answer for a moment then -

LES
I was thinking if I had a son hed
be out here with me now fishing
Thats what I was thinking when
you walked out here Thought you
might have been my son

NATHAN
Do you have a son
LES
No
NATHAN

Never married
Another pause Then finally he makes a face -

LES

Doomed

(he jiggles the line)
When I came back from Vietnam I
couldnt relate to anybody

(looking around)
Clean clothes folks saying Hello
going to parties - I couldnt
relate to it anymore Used to get
in my car and drive around My
buddies were afraid I was going to
die in a car accident they were-

NATHAN
Were you ever in a car accident

LES
(smiles)
Wouldnt know if I was 99

NATHAN
You still have PTSD Post
Traumatic Stress Disorder

LES
Well I tend to isolate dont I
What do you think Im doing out
here

NATHAN
But no more car accidents

LES
There were never any accidents
Dont you listen

NATHAN
And no kids

LES
Nope You

NATHAN
No

LES
Married

NATHAN
No more

LES

So you and me in the same boat
What kind of books you write

NATHAN
I write about people like you

LES
Is that so Whats the name of
one of your books

NATHAN
(hesitates)
The Human Stain Its not finished

LES
When it is Ill buy it

NATHAN
Ill send you a copy Whats your
name
99 99
LES
Les Farley send it care of Petes
Garage
NATHAN

I will if you promise to read it

Les rises putting down the fishing line and picking up the
dreadful-looking corkscrew AUGER

As Nathan transfixed with fear watches Les brings it over
to him crunching ominously on the thin ice holding it under
Nathans nose

Do we hear the ICE CRACKING under their combined weight

LES
I started ice fishing after my
wife left me All you have to do
is dress warm and own the right
equipment - like this auger You
drill a hole through the ice
Thisll cut through just about
anything - and drop your line with
your favorite lure right through

Nathan so frightened he cant speak -

LES

(continuing)
Any flash down there and the fish
are attracted Theyre sensitive
to movement The smallest
vibration can alert them - even in
the dark And its way dark down
there

Satisfied that Nathan is frightened his tone changes -

LES
(continuing)
If I had a son Little Les a son
of my own I reckon Id be
teaching him all this stuff
instead of you

NATHAN
Its cold out here

LES
You better believe it

99 99

NATHAN
taking a step
backwards)
I should be going

LES
But you know your ice fishing now
dont you You can put it in your
book

Nathan continues backing up still facing Les and that DRILL

NATHAN
Dont worry - I will

LES
And you know my secret place here
You know everything now dont
you But you wont tell will you

NATHAN
I hear you

LES
a beat then)
And hey Mr Zuckerman

ON NATHAN--He freezes

LES
(continuing)
What about the book

NATHAN
You got it its in the mail
WIDE ANGLE (NATHANS POV) Les stands motionless on the ice
holding the auger as Nathan slowly cautiously turns and
walks back towards shore Snow begins to fall and as we HOLD

ON LES FARLEY the snow grows thicker until the screen is
white We HOLD FOR A BEAT

SOUND OVER THE LIGHT CLICKING SOUNDS OF TYPING ON A
COMPUTER KEYBOARD

100 CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN AS TYPING APPEARS - 100

This is the story of the tricky life and bitter downfall of
Coleman Silk
