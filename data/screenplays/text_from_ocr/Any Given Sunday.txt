REVISED SHOOTING SCRIPT

May 1 1999
Any mans finest hour -- his greatest
fulfillment to all he holds dear -- is
that moment when he has worked his heart
out in a good cause and lies exhausted on
the field of battle -- victorious

Vince Lombardi
FADE IN

EXT SHARK STADIUM (MIAMI USA) - LATE DAY Al
(ANY SUNDAY)

MUSIC sets a mood of mystery verdure sky Grass sways
gently in the wind silence to the world Then a
football is placed in the grass The large taped
knuckles of a center grasp the football for the snap

The world is still coiled like a spring

CREDITS RUN

GAME 1 MINNESOTA AMERICANS AT MIAMI SHARKS - FIELD 1 - 1
CONTINUOUS ACTION

An EXPLOSION on the field -- as bodies crash against each
other like armies The game as played and felt in the pit

A swift short pass over the middle A tight end
(Miami) takes the hit Then the quarterback (Miami)
goes down hard A blur of motion A WHISTLE BLOWS and
referee 1 signals first down chains are moved

HELICOPTER 1 2

A steep view of the proceedings -- godlike evoking
ghosts wind as if the football gods look down on their
human combatants and vote for first downs touchdowns
careers lives These overheads punctuate the film
The silence lingers briefly -- before the Announcers
voices bring us back to the media reality of the late
20th Century

TUG KOLOWSKI (VO)
(on TV)

-- And what a beautiful day for
football it is here in South
Florida Its Sunday and the
sun is shining and playoff berths
are on the line It doesnt get
much better than this Dont you
think so Kevin

KEVIN BRANSON (VO)
(on TV)
Thats the one thing you and I can
agree on Tug You can almost
feel religion in the air here at
Miamis Shark Stadium

The MUSIC THEME -- a blend of martial choral and rock
and roll -- is now swallowed in the ROAR of the CROWD

SMASH CUT TO
FIELD 2

» the technicolor eyes of quarterback JACK CAP
ROONEY hostage to anger and pain as his aging frame
crashes on the dirty grass

SIDELINE 1
Head coach TONY DAMATO a striking intense man in his

50s moves in a five-yard swath of the sideline his eyes
flicking worriedly to his fallen alter-ago

TONY
Ive been doin this for too many
years
(at McKenna)
You mother Goddamn ass

Hes giving it to Leslie McKenna the right guard and
the other linemen as he senses the game is now shifting
momentum -- against him

TONY

SIDELINE 2

DR ALLIE POWERS 30s the new internist with the team
grabs his doctor box and starts onto the field

TONY
Powers Get the hell back here
Where you going Hes fine

Powers sheepishly u-turns back to the sideline where DR
HARVEY MANDRAKE the grey-haired team orthopedist gives
him a second scolding

MANDRAKE
What are you thinking Allie
Theres 143 on the clock You
walk on that field after the 2-
minute warning and we
automatically lose a time-out
Wake-up You been here almost a
goddamn season

POWERS
Sorry -- I thought he was hurt

As LESLIE McKENNA the big right guard helps Cap
up knowing hes blown the block

TUG (VO)
Yes sir Thats the real deal

Pantheon Cups Almost 50000
passing yards More touchdowns

CAP
(cising to McKenna)
McKenna you fat bubble of lard
One more block like that youll
end my career

TUG (VO)

our computers rank Jack Rooney
one of the top five quarterbacks
of all time when it comes to
pressure situations At 39 he
may be a step or two behind -- 12
off-season operations have a way
of doing that to you -- but he
still stands head and shoulders
above these new kids

WIVES SECTION 1 (VIDEO)

CINDY ROONEY a sweet-looking blonde waves back as she
notices the electronic eye gazing down on her other
wives join in

BRANSON (VO)

SIDELINE 4

TYLER CHERUBINI the stoic 32-year-old perpetual back-up
quarterback relays the telex signal from upstairs on his
headset to the field via walkie-talkie -- in addition to

various body signals both legitimate and deceptive

HUDDLE 1

QB Cap Rooney bangs on his helmet something in the
electronics is off He glares at his teammates and
though at times he chews them out like a Marine sergeant
there is an unmistakable affection for his line He
tries his hardest like an aging Boy Scout not to curse
not always successfully

CAP
Damn headset Never goddamn works
when you get hit Every damn
time Damnit Madman That
sonofabitch is headhunting

constant barrage of voices inside Caps helmet ceases

MEDIA BOOTH 1 12

TUG KOLOWSKI -- in the flesh -- is a boisterous boozy
veteran sportscaster alongside KEVIN BRANSON a young and
upcoming TV-type who seems Tugs opposite bland and safe

TUG
- But not all is paradise here in
Miami Cap Rooney may be on his way
into the record books but for Coach
Tony DAmato its been a dismal
season with attendance sliding as
the crosstown Dolphins prosper

INTERCUT WITH
STANDS 1 (VIDEO) 13

Reveals the stadium at two-thirds capacity

SIDELINE 5 (VIDEO AND FILM) Al13

Tony on TV display talking intensely into his headset
takes us past defensive coordinator MONTEZUMA MONROE --
60s a monument of a man former star linebacker now
limping noticeably He glares strongly rarely moves
With him is 34-year-old vet LUTHER LAVAY linebacker and
the captain of the defense black built and a total
predator His nickname SHARK

TUG (VO)
- With three straight losses and

a slide from four years ago when
they won two Pantheon Cups in a row
DAmatos going to have to
struggle to get his aging team
into the playoffs But today is
looking good for the Sharks
leading the Americans in the second
quarter 21-17

BRANSON (VO)

» They still got those holes in
that offensive line Tug but the
biggest problem has got to be the
defense and Montezuma Monroe
knows it

An ASSISTANT offers Monroe a set of digitally-produced
enhancements of the Minnesota offensive formations

MONROE
Get that shit outta my face
Shark -- what the fucks goin on
out there We gotta get more
pressure on the goddamn
quarterback That motherfuckers
splitting our seam 15 yards every
goddamn time Now fix it

SHARK
Im on it Coach

He stomps toward the defensive unit

BRANSON (VO)
theres also of course the
impact of management decisions on
the Sharks turn in fortunes

OWNERS BOX 1 (VIDEO) 14

As seen on TV several family friends and VPs mill
around but we only see the back of elegantly-attired
blonde President and co-owner CHRISTINA PAGNIACCI

TUG (VO)
No question Kev Since the death
of Big Daddy Art Pagniacci --
his daughter and new President of
the team Christina Pagniacci has
made some -- many people think --
questionable financial decisions in
letting three All-Pro Bowl selections
leave town for free agency

BRANSON (VO)
-» although she did bring Julian
Washington in from KC A big
1500-yard back

FIELD 4 (VIDEO AND FILM) 15

JULIAN WASHINGTON 27 an extremely strong sexy
solidly-built 230-pound running back sets his teeth
blazing with jewelry and facial paint on the far edges of
the Associations rule book (The Associated Football
Franchise of America) He presently goes into play-
motion

TUG (VO)
-- who can be great when hes not
hurt And his hearts in it And
here we go

Rooney barks out the numbers hot reading the coming
blitz The clock slows as his eyes flick from the key
safety to his own team Can they handle the confusion
of the audible

ROONEY

Set Blue 83 check check
Arizona 99 Cadillac Arizona 99
Cadillac Hut Hut Hut

The Shark linemen read the shift but Madman is clearly
confused blocking assignments are missed

Cap takes the snap and fades back to pass but hes an
inch too slow and a year too old -- his arm in the air
about to release he is brutally blind-sided by a fast
reptilian defensive end Simultaneously a blitzing
safety hits him in the lower back with his helmet Cap
goes down hard again landing on his own blockers helmet
at an awkward angle -- he screams loudly -- and this
time nothing moves

SIDELINE 6 16

Tony is looking at his worst fear come true An eerie
quiet momentarily pervades the stadium DAmato breaks
it yelling at Dr Powers

TONY
Get the hell out there Move
Cant you see hes hurt

Back-up QB Tyler Cherubini nervously jams index cards with
play calls under the clear plastic holders inside his
special wristband intersecting Coach DAmato

TONY
Nice and easy Ty okay Were up

Cherubini AD LIBS and jogs onto the field Fans stomp
their feet in sync with the driving beat of the
inspirational Shark Theme

BRANSON (VO)

to be all right Listen to that
crowd

Cap crosses towards the bench on the shoulders of Powers
and Trainer 1 Tony intersects briefly but he doesnt
seem to want to confront this makes light of it

Back-up quarterback Tyler
Cherubini hasnt seen a lot of
action recently

FIELD 6 23

From the BOOTH POV -- the team claps and breaks from the
huddle

TUG (VO)
Hate to tell you Kev its a
little scarier than that Tyler
Cherubini hasnt thrown for a
first down all season but its
going to take a nail and a coffin
to keep Cap down on the farm
warming the pine This may only
be a game but to Cap Rooney its
the only game in town

Minnesota attacks with everything theyve got
Cherubini never even sees the light of day as he is
buried coughing up the ball -- which bounces into the
hands of a surprised Minnesota safety -- who sprints
20-some yards into the Miami end zone for a touchdown

The fans go wild with rage booing the fallen Cherubini

BRANSON (VO)
Oh my gosh Touchdown And the

TONY
Look you the offense why do
you think we work on the blitz
package all week Weve lost two
quarterbacks in one half of
football ‘cause our line cant
pick up a goddamn backside bandit
on max protection You and I
know this is goddamn stupid
football and youre stressing
this shit outta me Weve worked
on the calls over and over again
but you have no goddamn focus or
concentration McKenna keep your
head on a swivel youve got to
slide out there and pick up that
robber -- roll up those outside
linebackers Beamen know your
site adjustments Sanderson and
Fox will break off their routes
but you have to deliver it on
time Weve had two goddamn
turnovers this half you guys are
dumping on my turnover ratio

You the defense youve got to
create something out there youve
got to start flying around the
fucking ball and hitting somebody
Dont let these assholes chew up
the clock on us On first down
theyre killing us with the
weakside slant Corners when we
put eight in the box youve got
to jam the receivers take ‘em on
youre hesitating If youre
gonna make a mistake go on Make
it a big one Im not gonna eat
your lunch for that but dont
fuck around like pussies at a pee
party you hear me PJ Mac
Beast Man Horny Shark One two
yards less each time and theyll be

EXT TUNNEL - NIGHT 56

Winters night has now fallen as the team hollers
exiting a narrow tunnel onto the field The stadium is
charming but decayed (1930s WPA architecture) and in need
of significant renovation

Jimmy Sanderson the young star wide receiver for the
Sharks repeatedly adjusts his shoulder pads talking to
himself as he walks he is all hands and nerves a
thoroughbred with a sweet personality

SANDERSON
I am precision-honed muscular-
tempered steel My moves are
cosmic Time to save the day
My legs torso and arms are

Willie gets the message Several fans intoxicated hurl
profanities peanuts beer seat cushions at the Sharks
One OBESE FAN in particular

FAN
You stink Hey Beamen If you
could chuck a football like you
chuck vomit youd be an all-pro

Willie ignores him but when the Fan throws his beer at
him it empties on Madman who is rushing out last his
IVs gone Enraged Madman roars and tries to go up into

teammates AD LIBS

desperately dives back for it -- but everyone else is
diving too including Willie

INT WILLIES APARTMENT - NIGHT 98

In a high-rise apartment above the bay sporting a
glorious view of the curve of the city against the ocean
shadows play off the balcony from the TELEVISION within

Jack Roses Sports Corner rather an ESPN-type national
show)

WILLIE

Mom I didnt know I was going
in sure I woulda called you
She wants to talk to you

He laughs and hands the phone to his attractive girlfriend
VANESSA STRUTHERS on the couch next to him -- a longtime
sweetheart she is studying marketing

VANESSA
(into phone)
Mrs Beamen hi Yeah he was
great No I think he was just
nervous

ON TV

Jack Ripper Rose the local expert on the Sharks who
seems to prove that the more you know about a team the
less you really understand interviews a guest on his
local Sports Corner

ROSE (V0O)
(on TV to guest)

- Frank Frank Frank you gotta
wonder why DAmato called that
play when everyone knows J-Man
likes to pick his spot when he
runs and youre running the
same play twice in a row Come
on Theres a reason this team
has lost four in a row Forget
about the offensive line and Cap
Rooney Forget about money-
grubbing greed-head Christina
Pagniacci who sold three of last
years stars And forget about
the defense -- there is none
This team is just not in sync
They remind me of my ex

She had 21 different personalities
Seven of them hated me

(as his guest laughs)
No kiddin I think DAmatos play
books have consisted of the same
11 plays since 1971 Its gotta
be a shorter list than The
History of Jews in Sports but
lucky for him the Sharks have a
couple of teeth left in their
head otherwise these guys would
be bottom-feeding at 2-14 instead
of thrashin at 7-6

BACK TO SCENE

Glancing away from the omnipresent television (several
others dot the bar space all tuned to sports) Tony
drinks Scotch -- one of several -- his thoughts depressed
and fatalistic tonight Four losses in a row is a
phenomenon that has never happened to him before

MANDY a young glamorous woman sitting down the bar with
a girlfriend catches his eye

TONY
(re TV)
Glad hes not talking about me

( ) 99

CROZIER
(during this)

- you play safe you lose Its
just not a theory they can prove
it You feed a computer all the
games where a coach protected a
modest lead -- 10 points or
less -- 300 games 10 years
theres this guy he did this
study at Harvard it came out
the coaches lost 71 percent
of the time

MONROE
71 percent my ass It cant be
more than 40 percent probably
less Whats the information they

put in those damn things
Shit whatre you guys gonna do
next -- stick computer chips up my

players butts so you can monitor
what their shits thinking

CROZIER
(sweetly)
Thats a great fucking idea Monty
-- if you had any neuronal
connections left after what -- 20
concussions -- I might actually
take that as an insult but

TONY

(signals the

bartender )
You get any more stats in those
goddamn computers what the hell
you need a coach for anymore I
mean its like were all rushing
forward here -- faster bigger
smarter Were all thinking too
damned much were not even
looking around at what were
passing by leaving behind
You know what I mean

MONROE
I sure do

The BARTENDER pours another Scotch beers for the others

BARTENDER
Here you go Coach

TONY
Thanks (nickname)
(to all noting his
caricature above)
Yknow Im starting to look like
that guy Thats whats fucking
scary

MONROE
Yeah a little

Crozier clears his throat needs to talk business

CROZIER
Yknow Tony I think we gotta
simplify the playbook for
Cherubini These Rhino
linebackers are fast little ATVs
We gotta pick em apart with
precision -- Cherubini to two
tight ends ask the wideouts to
go short over the middle More
screens traps

TONY
Nick Im not re-doing the whole
goddamn game plan for Cherubini
with three more games The
linemen arent that quick yknow
what I mean and when Cap comes
back for the playoffs hes gonna
go crazy with a whole new calling
scheme different rhythms
shit

CROZIER
Tony what Im saying is if we
dont redo the game plan we wont
make the playoffs and what
happens if Cap doesnt come back
this year

TONY
(starting to anger)
Hey Nick -- when you get your

team you do it your way But
dont let me catch you telling
anyone Cap Rooneys not comin’
back okay I dont care what
Mrs Pagniacci Junior says Stay
out of it Ive seen Cap do
this for years

He leaves 99

TONY (CONTD)
When he sets his mind to it
hell walk right in there -- maybe
‘gainst the Emperors -- and hell
shine just like a new dime thats
how fucking great this guy is
Never underestimate Rock
Rooney okay

CROZIER
Im sorry But we need a game
plan Tony that

than two of these I think of
Jeanette

How is that gal

TONY
(grimaces)
We try talkin but we sound like
two undertakers talkin shop

MONROE
Great lady Jeanette You gave
her up too easy

TONY
Yever try living with her
Monty She was nuts Went
fundamentalist on me

MONROE

(finishes his beer

to Crozier)
They say a coach needs three
things in this life -- a wife who
shuts up a dog who licks him
whenever he wants anda
quarterback who dont get hurt
So this turkeys wife took a hike
on him his dog got run over and
his quarterback ruptured his
goddamn back talk about luck
Gotta piss

CROZIER
Mind if I join you

( )

A99 99
MONROE
Only if you hold your own dick
kid
CROZIER

So tell me Monty did you really
play with leather helmets in the
good old days

TONY
(chimes in)
You forgot the fourth thing Monty
-- a defense I know its old-
fashioned to keep the other team
from scoring but its effective

MONROE
Kiss my ass DAmato Lemme
tell you something kid those
leather helmets were fucking
great They held our brains in
cause back then men knew how to
hit and get hit When they
allowed face-guards for you
punks that was the end of the
game that I knew

As they move off

CROZIER
Do you defensive guys ever move
your lips when you speak Or is
it true you all like grunting
better

MONROE
I like grunting better than that
techno-babble bullshit you offensive
weenies talk

-- I tell you right here and now
-- Chicagos gonna wipe us out
They got a playbook with 200
variations on the pass for
chrissake Sure DAmato likes to
act tough and keep it simple
stupid for our Sharkies and some
people even think hes a genius
with his book of 75 plays but
hey a lot of us think you know
like this is no longer the 70s
and the 80s -- hey were talking
the late 60s when this guy
started coaching -- and you all
know by now how much of a fan I am
of DAmato getting himself a
lobotomy or maybe cloned with some
goat because anything even Jack
Kevorkian would be better than
what we got Give me some smack

(high-fives

his guest)
Give me a pound Give me some
love

degenerate than he actually looks Mandy the young

Youre that coach arent you

Yeah Tony DAmato

He shakes hands

Wow Hi Im Mandy Murphy I

I dont think age matters I
really dont I think older guys
have a certain thing

TONY
Oh yeah

MANDY

Yeah Older guys are the nicest
guys At least in my
experience

(she gently touches

his hand)
You know I always wanted to meet
you ever since I was about 17
I was going with this football
jock -- and I saw you on the
sidelines You were winning this
big game

Yeah thats it That was wild

(laughs segues)
- you think were slowing down
Monty

Shit were not getting any
younger These are long days 16
hours somethings gotta give

TONY
you think you can lose your
coaching instincts

MONROE
(chuckles )
You never had ‘em anyway so how
can you lose ‘em

TONY
Well that last play today there
was a moment when I didnt know
what to call thats never
happened to me like that before
in 22 seasons

Come on we were on our third
quarterback Christina was
throwing plays at us every five
minutes and Julians about 10

brief montage set to music that leads us to)

EXT CHRISTINA PAGNIACCIS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION
DAY

Tony drives up to a beautiful mansion on one of
Miamis bays in an older elegant car As he talks into
an audio-video monitor the gates roll open

INT CHRISTINA PAGNIACCIS OFFICEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 102
ACTION - DAY

In a large cross-shadowed private office Christina and
Johnny Polito listen to Ed Phillips on the phone --
noticing Tonys drive-up on the indoor monitor The
walls reveal pictures of Christina with various high-
powered individuals in the city an MBA from Stanford
others that are competitive at tennis and golf on
safari and skiing with her husband shots of her as a
young girl with her dad In these images of fishing
riding hunting perhaps one senses that Christina was
raised as an only son by Art Pagniacci and forever
embodies the hardness of that fate

ED PHILLIPS (0S)
(into phone)
Well we think 100 million is
extortion too Governor Then
will you file a friend-of-the-
court brief on our behalf if we go
up against the Leagues transfer

fee Great
CHRISTINA
» youre sure No public bond
issues -- no extra tax assessments

ED PHILLIPS
(waves her off
nodding)

-- couldnt ask for more than
that good talking to you
Governor Say hi to Teresa And
Christina sends a big kiss Okay

( )

102 102
Hangs up

CHRISTINA
(excited)
So let me get this straight the
Governor of Californias saying
theres nothing for the public to
vote on right

ED PHILLIPS
(pleased)
Thats what hes saying Hes got
a way to finance a new stadium in
Hawthorne with lottery and casino
money As long as we partner with
this realty company hes pushing

JOHNNY POLITO
Sure He owns all that shit land
he wants to get rid of

CHRISTINA
-- he gives us the full concession
parking signage sponsorship money

ED PHILLIPS
(nods )
-- and 100 percent from the
luxury boxes and club seats

CHRISTINA
(amazed)
My God LA is a dream You
realize theyre giving us the
world Ed

ED PHILLIPS
(downplaying it)
Well its certainly good enough to
leverage the City of Miami into a
new stadium

CHRISTINA
Oh Ed Its more than that
(pause seeing Tonys
car pull up)
I just dont trust Smalls backing
this stadium bond Dad always
said he was a thief in a tuxedo

She glances at a picture on her desk of her late father
Beneath it in the silver frame she has had engraved
Whatever It Takes

( ) 102

ED PHILLIPS
What do you expect Smalls is an
asshole but hell deal He
always has And he knows weve
got a big glitch anyway

CHRISTINA
We dont really Ed we can

ED PHILLIPS
You keep underestimating the power
of the franchises Christina
They dont want us They want an
expansion team in LA which they
can make a lot more money with

JOHNNY POLITO
Bullshit They want an established
team with a fan base A new
stadium with a multiplex theater
shopping mall Were in the
entertainment business Ed Think
football in the 21st Century

ED PHILLIPS
Johnny have you got some sleazy
little side deal I dont know
about yet

JOHNNY POLITO
Ed youre getting old

ED PHILLIPS
And youre getting greedy
Johnny

CHRISTINA

The Association will listen to
reason LA is an entertainment
empire It can easily handle two
teams Here what The wrong fan
base No Hispanic players no
Hispanic fans

(off silence)
Ed if ever you owed Dad a favor
make it this one This team will
be born again in LA

What about the Rosenthal bid

CHRISTINA
(thinking about it)
250 million Its so low

Christina
Tony in 102

ED PHILLIPS
Wasnt so low when your dad and I
started

JOHNNY POLITO
With a new stadium and a winning
team Ed we could sell the team
for 800 million

ED PHILLIPS

(disbelieving)
Youre like your father that way
darling -- a dreamer My advice

to you is sell the goddamn team
You dont really want to own a
football team Christina Youre
still young -- start a family

conflicted watches as her housekeeper shows

CHRISTINA
I still like this business
Lets keep this quiet for now
Ed can we

she flicks on a state-of-the-art video

The shot of Washington fumbling in excruciating slo-mo

You know I can see why my mother
somehow got herself into a drunken
stupor watching football games all
her life but this kind of play
makes you want to jump out the

fucking window

TONY
You can run that play a million
times Christy but it aint
gonna change a thing On any
given Sunday

CHRISTINA
(overlapping)
You either gonna win or you gonna
lose The point is can you win or
lose like a man Dad said a lot
of catchy things

TONY
Actually I said it but

CHRISTINA
But he never could stand losing
could he
(as Julian fumbles
again)
- But J just couldnt resist
going for his bonus yards

TONY
Blame me not Julian It was my
call

CHRISTINA
-- I know it was Tony -- but
Ill tell you this -- Julian

wasnt thinking about you he was
thinking about the extra million
dollars he gets when he hits 1500
yards

(glancing at Ed)
Which by the way definitely
helps blow out our fucking salary
cap for next year

A102
A102

A102
TONY

Youre the one who negotiated his
incentive clause

CHRISTINA
-- which is why Id like you to
sit him out -- then maybe hell

get his head into the game And
save us some dollars in the
bargain

TONY
Pretty smart move Christy You
want me to bench my All-Pro back
Any other suggestions

A testy edge to the dialogue as Christina freezes the
image of Julian fumbling She shows him the sports
section of USA Today -- folded to a condemnation of

the team specifically Tony Although raised to treat
Tony like an uncle in a large Italian-American family
the team comes first and foremost

CHRISTINA
Sarcasm is not a solution Four
in a row Tony They want your
head Without Cap its gonna
take a miracle to make the
playoffs

TONY
(re the newspaper)

- Your fatherd laugh at this
jerk Christy Were a solid
team and were gonna get to the
playoffs This is not the time to
panic

CHRISTINA
Im not panicking -- but no
surgeon I know in the country is
saying Capll be back by playoff
time -- even with the bye week

TONY
(waves it off)
Doctors are like lawyers always
protecting their asses against
malpractice

Tony without the playoffs theres
no more TV money And frankly I
dont think we have a chance in
hell of getting this new stadium
bond issue through

(wearying of Tony)
- the economics just dont work --
the fact is this season is a
disaster a write-off Its over

Now Tonys headache is getting worse

TONY
Its over The hell its over
We been there before -- I can pull

this out I always have Worse
things than this have

CHRISTINA
Dad used to say No intensity no
victory Where the hell is your

intensity Tony We were always
in the playoffs Four years ago
the only thing we worried about
was winning a third Pantheon Cop
Now what Were a second-tier
team Tony thats what

(as he objects)
No admit it Youre not
being honest were the fifth
sixth team in this league We
just dont get the respect
anymore For chrissake Tony
just four years ago we won the
Pantheon Cup Do you remember
We beat the pants off
Massachusetts Dad would be
shocked to see this mess we
created

Tony is fuming but a part of him knows shes right

Were solid were just not
inspired We got too many free
agents

for the money and he brings that
attitude with him to the team
The end of the season he goes
And we rebuild our running game and

CHRISTINA

(pissed)
Running game Okay -- you always
talk about a running game But
who cares as long as you win
People want to watch passes
touchdowns high scores Thats
the game now Tony We paid a
lot of money to get Nick Crozier
here from Minnesota specifically
to modernize this offense But
when I look down at the field I
dont see any new play calling I
dont see him doing what he does
best And frankly what is most
disturbing is I dont see you even
listening to his calls from the
booth

TONY
Football is played on the field
Christina not in the goddamn
boxes You knew that when you had
candy stuck in your braces
Whend you forget it

CHRISTINA
(bristles)
So you know everything about
everything right Tony

Another silence Ed coughs Christina regrets the
atmosphere throws up her hands and paces

ED PHILLIPS

You gripe about Julian Washington
but you completely ignore the
problems with Cap and Shark I
dont get it

A102 A102

TONY
If wed gotten the linemen I
wanted in the first place our
first two quarterbacks might
still be walking

CHRISTINA
Think about the future Do you
know what we could get for Cap
right now Probably a first and a
third draft choice Hes still
got an arm and people respect
him We know hes finished but if
were smart we can

TONY

No I dont know that Christy I
dont Caps got two maybe three
great years left in him This is
football Today guys in their 40s
are playing

(a silence)
Do I gotta remind you he helped
build this franchise which you
benefitted from That hes a hero
to the working people of Florida
And one of the greatest pressure
players of all time You just
dont cut a man like Cap Rooney

CHRISTINA
Excuse me -- Cap and Shark were
great but memories dont pass and
tackle like they used to

TONY
Shark changed linebacking forever
He made a quantum leap in the
game

CHRISTINA
And we can say good-bye to
both of them with dignity With
class Well give ‘em positions
in the front office retire their
numbers A going-away day that

TONY
(angry)
That goes without saying But I
am not cutting Cap Rooney or Shark

you do it with

My contract is very clear on this
point Christy I coach my way
I never tolerated interference from
the front office and your father
never interfered when

ED PHILLIPS

(politick)
Tony Art spent money like water
He never really cared about the
bottom line He wanted to win at
any cost In the modern game
with marketing costs high as they
are

CHRISTINA

Tony I am not re-signing a seven-
million-dollar-a-year 39-year-
old quarterback no matter how big
he was

(pointing to a stack

of budget sheets on

her desk)
I crunch those numbers every month
till my fingers bleed We make
less money than 90 percent of the
other teams The economics simply
dont make any sense

TONY
(intense)
Fuck the economics Your father
you hear me Your father never
interfered He made it work

CHRISTINA
(equally intense)

-- Because you were a fighter
then You had intensity Tony
But today hed cut your ass
Because thats just the way the
game is now I love this team as
much -- if not more -- than you
I was born into this goddamn
business so dont try to make me
out to be some heartless bitch in
a skybox bleeding my players dry

TONY
Whats your point Christy

( )
A102 A102
CHRISTINA
(drawing up)
The point is as much as I

respect my famous ‘Uncle Tony
-- the teams just not responding
to you and Ill be damned if Im
going to let everything my father
fought for slide down the drain
with you at the helm I will do

anything -- you hear me anything
-- to bring this team back to
greatness

TONY

I guess I had nothing to do with
that It was all your dad Am I
excused now

He throws a hard look at Ed who looks away Tony stalks
to the door

Christina
Beer

CHRISTINA
(after him)
Whos playing the child now Tony
Do I have to remind you of what
kind of ground youre on
Everybodys got to negotiate
you too

TONY
(at the door)
Are you saying my contracts up at
the end of the year And the
‘economics arent there Is that
what youre saying Christy

CHRISTINA
-- You know youre not offering
me a whole lot right now Tony
‘Whatever it takes’ Im just
doing it the way he did it

Youre not even close You know
how your dad and I used to
negotiate my contract We had a

of his own)

the field to see a mad brawl of players for a Shark
fumble -- a Crusaders player comes up with the ball

And worse At the line of scrimmage Leslie McKenna the
right guard is down

As REFEREE 3 signals the California first down to a

Willie ignores him his eyes downfield -- a Crusaders’
lineman is almost on him when Madman slams him aside at
the last moment Willie takes the shot -- its a dead

perfect pass threading the microscopic gap between two

Crusaders defenders Sanderson spins in midair so that
the nose of the ball crosses the goal line just as he is
slammed backwards by the backs -- too late -- the Refs

arms shoot up -- touchdown

Willie races down the field and grabs Sanderson both of
them breaking into a funky dance

The mood in the locker room shifts quickly as Christina
Pagniacci enters escorted by two security guards in
suits with earphones -- along with her VPs In a good
mood she passes most of the no-name players signalling
or calling out to some of her stars (AD LIB) Cap
notices her not seeing him Joe Polito makes up for it
coming over to him as she approaches Willie

CHRISTINA
(at her charming
best)
Willie congratulations you were
great Really exciting to watch
out there

WILLIE
(a winning smile)
I thrill to chill maam

CHRISTINA
Two in a row ‘Whatever it takes
-- right You make me excited
about the future again

Others look on at the two of them

Willie in his jockstrap is coming on to Christina ina
cheeky street way showing off his muscles Christina
accustomed to locker rooms and not seeing her players in
any way as competitive with her husband ignores the fact
he doesnt add one stitch of clothing to his jock

Willie senses this gulf and will come to resent it as
another synecdoche for the ownerplayer class structure

She exits

WILLIE
(quietly)

- I hope you dont mind but you
handle yourself real good in
business and all I dont BS
Miss Pagniacci but you do it to
me Howd you like to hook up for
a drink or something quiet

CHRISTINA
(a little surprised)

- Im flattered Willie I
really am but Im married Ive
just never dated players It
gives the wrong impression

WILLIE
You mean youre influenced by what
other people think

CHRISTINA
I think we all are in business
Willie So come by tomorrow and

well talk I think youll like
what youre gonna hear okay

his punctuation)

some kind of medical miracle He
really could be ready for New York

CHRISTINA
You told anyone Harvey

Mandrake thinking she would be pleased shakes his head
realizes what shes really thinking

MANDRAKE
--- ‘Course hed have to take a
lot of pain and his ankles not 100
percent But he will Hes got
the mind of an ox Hes so
freaked about Beamen stealing his
job hed probably play with a
fractured neck

CHRISTINA
Harvey could you slow him down
Tell him hes not responding to
rehab well enough -- just till
the playoffs Give Beamen his
shot

MANDRAKE
(pause)
Well everyone knows herniated
discs are iffy I could
recommend

months Theres no way to predict
what another head-hit would do
Christina

CHRISTINA
How come Dallas had their
quarterback practically in a coma
last month just before he played
one of the greatest games of his
life

MANDRAKE
(backtracking)

-- Well no question he wants his
tackle and sack bonus bad
Theoretically his brains at
increased risk but its
theoretical and I can pump him
full of cortisone to catch the
swelling and let him finish out
the season without a
malpractice suit of course --

(off her look)
Im joking I dont really think
anythings gonna happen but Im
not a complete prick you know

kind of conscience

was really tough for me and maybe
Ive been taking some of that out
on you I know youre still
learning the system and the
pressures incredible --

WILLIE
I can handle it

TONY
I know But we need to talk about
this I think you got a great
future in football but first off
we gotta deal with some basics
Like if the play book is too
complicated we can simplify it for
you --

WILLIE
Man that book is too slow When
I am out there on the field I just
gotta feel it I cant be
thinking about nothing but the
juice I got to let it out

TONY
Listen youre too fast out there
as it is You need to wait for
the plays to develop Our offense
was built up over years its like
Chinese water torture taking
apart the other team a little ata
time its the death of 1000 cuts

WILLIE
I like things I guess a little
more muscular suits my style

TONY
(stops eating)
Is that why you been changing the
plays

WILLIE
Im trying to read the defense
Coach its

TONY
Im not talking about audibles
Look I know you like making the
big plays I understand that
But our game plans are the result
of a lot of work and a lot of

experience

WILLIE
I know that --

TONY
I know you do When you change
plays youre showing disrespect to
a lot of people in this
organization --

WILLIE
I dont mean to --

TONY
People whove worked for years in
this club and around the League
People whove sacrificed more than
you will ever know to be in this
game

Willie sees where this is going

WILLIE
Im trying to win Coach I been
warming the bench ever since I got
to the pros and I dont plan on
going back there I dont wanna
disrespect nobody but winning
is the only thing I respect

Tony looks at Willie with a singular quiet intensity

TONY
Okay son listen to me very
carefully and remember what Im
going to tell you You can forget
every other goddamn thing I ever
said if you remember this because
someday youre going to realize
its the truest thing you ever
heard This game has got to be
about more than winning

(relaxes a little)

-- I guess thats what I wanted
to say Youre part of something
here A tradition Lombardi
Unitas Tittle Sammy Baugh
hundreds of great players Those
men on the wall youre part of
that now And along the way I

want you to cherish that ‘cause
when its gone its gone forever
and

You know I look at all these
pictures and trophies and stuff
and it just makes me sad Like
the room is full of ghosts When
Im done with the game or the
game is done with me I dont
wanna be no ghost up on a wall I
want moren that

Tony takes a long moment

TONY
- Looks like Caps gonna make it
back in time for the playoffs

athlete I am Look me in the eye
Coach and tell me Caps the
better player

TONY
Caps the better player

Sure I guess that was another
guy winning the last two games I
put points on the board He lost
four in a row I lead by doing

TONY
You kicked ass kid but Cap
Rooney has been doing it for
years and he goddamn deserves his
day in the sun so dont start

WILLIE
And I deserve the bench right

TONY
- Hes been the quarterback of
this team as long as

WILLIE
And his time is over And yours
is too ‘less you start taking

some risks Start playing the
game the way it is now It aint
all those pictures on the wall
anymore --

Ive lived this game for three
decades kid I know football

You can feed the press and the fans
all that ‘sacrifice and glory
grand ol man of the game crap

long line of guys like you from
college on with that bullshit
halftime speech

Its bullshit huh You think
you

Cause its really about money
Rakin in the TV contracts fat-—
cat boosters sittin’ in their
skyboxes and coaches uppin their
salaries all of ‘em looking for
the next black stud to get em in
the Top Ten put ‘em in the bowl

games -- Its just like the pros
‘cept in the pros the field hands
get paid

TONY

Dont play the race card with me
kid Twenty-five years Ive worked
with men of your color Youre
good because youre different not
because

WILLIE
Maybe its not racism maybe its
placism but the black man still
gotta know his place right Coach

TONY
What are you saying You dont
trust anybody ‘cause of what
happened to you in college You
knew the rules Willie you broke
em

WILLIE
Broke ‘em Howd I break ‘em

TONY
You broke em Thats how you

broke ‘em

Man I lost a million-dollar
signing bonus ‘cause a booster
gave me a three-hundred-dollar
suit to go to his kids wedding

Hell everybody was getting
something Hows a black man
supposed to get through college
when he dont got the money to get
clothes go on a date They all
had their hands out but it was me
they suspended

WILLIE (CONTD)
I dropped six rounds in the draft
cause of that And the coaches
rapping me troublemaker ‘arrogant
‘wont play ball all that corporate
shit they hit the brothers with
when they wont kiss the money
Shit I coulda made millions
of dollars if Id kissed that big
ass Julians kissing all the time
You talk about sacrifice I
sacrificed about ten million dollars
is what I sacrificed cause of
those dumb rednecks like your
coach friend at San Diego who
makes me corner back ‘cause I got
fast feet It was him separated
my shoulder fucked up my throwin
arm tackling some 250-pound
bullmother I was a great football
player but nobody gave me the time
of day or the season I needed
to heal that shoulder They
traded me right outta there

TONY
Blame anybody but yourself
Willie Ysee thats what a
leader is about the times hes
gotta sacrifice because he has to
lead by example not by fear or

WILLIE
(challenged)

Fear Who you talking to I
hung in there when nobody gave a
shit about me I rode the bench
for five fucking years And now I
get my one lousy shot Im 26
years old -- half my football life
is over -- and now you tell me
You go on back to the bench son
Cause you gotta sacrifice for
the greater glory of Cap Rooney
Well fuck you Coach Im not
buying that brand ‘cause youre
some scared old man who wont let
me play my way ‘cause I might just
win And then what the fuck was
your life all about

Tony fights to control himself Outside the evening
crawls through the twilight

Youre not some flash-in-the-pan
receiver or corner back or even Julian
Washington kid youre a goddamn
quarterback You know what that
means Its the top spot kid

guy who everybodys looking at

wants smacking sportswriters --
those days are over You start
Willie on Sunday and you make the
adjustment to modern times -- or
youre out Tony And thats

You think youre gonna tell me
what to do Your father never
told me what to do AND YOURE
NOT GONNA START NOW YOUNG LADY

Will you stop using my father as a
scapegoat Do you think you dont
have to deal with me by raising my
father all the time When are you
going to listen to me Cause Ill
tell you this right now -- Id

cut my fathers ass if we were
losing like this

-- And you know what I wouldnt
lose a nights sleep over it
Cause like you he was
sentimental And I cant afford
to be Im in the business of
holding this team together That
means selling Selling tickets
skyboxes players Selling
Thats why Willie works for me
He sells tickets And thats why
hes starting Sunday

TONY
You know Im really sick and tired
of you calling me an old asshole
Your father was no genius He acted
like he was And he took a lot of
credit for things he didnt do
But let me tell you something he
at least respected me and he
respected the concept of the coach
coaching and the owner owning I
cant even imagine what hed think
of you right now with this
act youre putting on but my
hunch is hed be ashamed

CHRISTINA
(in a danger zone)
Here we go again You dont
listen do you --

TONY
Ashamed

CHRISTINA
Why the hell do you think he left
me in charge you bullheaded
moron He couldve made you
General Manager -- but he didnt
did he Why Because he knew you
didnt have the guts to do it
without him when he was gone
alright He told me so himself
Right there on his deathbed

Thats why Tony -- because he
didnt trust you anymore Because
you got old

When you truly contemplate what
Christina is it really isa
tragedy Believe me she will
fire you and sell the soul of the
team -- and everything her father
stood for will die and that is
as it should be and neither you
nor I or maybe even Christina
herself will ever understand her
real motives

leave this game with a little
dignity left

Rose continues to rattle on in the bg but Tony ignores
the babble of our time removing from the drawer a small
wooden box and a framed picture of a younger Tony with
Jeanette Timmy and Melinda

by play -- until were finished
Were in hell right now gentlemen
believe me We can sit here and
get the shit kicked out of us or
we can fight our way back into the
light we can climb out of this
anger and this doubt and this

uncertainty -- we can climb out of
hell -- one inch at a time or

(pause)

--- I wish I could do it for you
but I cant Im too old I look
around at your faces and I see
young men and I think I made every
wrong choice a middle-aged old man
can make -- my life is a long list
of rookie mistakes I pissed away
all my money chased off everyone

that loved me lately I cant
even stand the face I see in the
mirror

This team has never heard their Coach take it to such a
personal level

TONY

-- As we get older some things
are taken away well thats
part of life but you only learn
that when you lose something
You find out that life is this game
of inches Sos football
Because the margin for error in
either game football or life is
so small so small guys One
half-step too late or too early
and you dont quite make it One
half-second too slow or too fast
and you dont quite catch it
‘cause its half a fingertip away
The inches we need are everywhere
around us theyre in every break
of the game every minute every
second Mandrake forgot that He
was grabbing for miles when he
only needed inches And on this
team there are no shortcuts
There are no more Doctor
Mandrakes On this team we fight
for that inch We tear ourselves
and everyone else around us to
pieces for that inch We claw
with our fingernails for that inch
cause when you add up all those
inches that is what makes the
fucking difference between winning

and losing -- between living and
dying In any fight I can tell

you this its the guy whos
willing to die whos going to win
that inch

(MORE )

And I know if Im gonna have any
kind of life anymore its because
Im still willing to fight and die
for that inch

(beat)
Thats what living is

(sweeps the team

with a look)
The six inches in front of your
face I cant make you do it
You have to look around -- look at
the guy next to you -- look into
his eyes -- and I think youll see
a guy you know will go that inch
with you Youll see a guy wholl
sacrifice himself for this team
because when it comes down to it
he knows you would do the same for
him Thats a team gentlemen
And either we will heal now as a
team -- or we will die as
individuals

The old man will not be denied in a race to the goal
line A Dallas defender zeroes in on him Rather than
slide Rooney hurls himself into the air inspired
possibly by the younger Willie and collides head-first
with a Dallas defender -- a thunderclap of sound

The ball tight in Rooneys grasp is planted firmly
beyond the goal line -- touchdown

Willie pump fakes a pass to Sanderson -- the Dallas

takes off right with the ball skimming the outside of
the line -- Madman delivers a devastating block -- Julian
runs slightly behind Willie ready to throw his block --

-- but Willie sees some daylight and tears down the
sideline -- the Dallas safety is racing him -- Just as he
zooms in on Willie he laterals the ball to Julian just
behind him

Julian snags the ball -- leaps around the safety who
slams Willie out of bounds --

Julian races against time down the sideline turning on

- I dont think theres anything
else you could do Coach

TONY
-- There was this great

quarterback in the 70s I knew
This guy was one tough
sonofabitch Fought for every
inch he got Didnt have your
natural skill this guy but he
made it happen he won So time
went by and he didnt know it
but his day was over He couldnt
go deep like he used to and he
started missing the easy
underneath routes the game was
just passing him by Anyway I
ran into him a few weeks ago in
LA and we had a few beers we
started talking and you know what
he said

(MORE )

( ) 311

TONY (CONTD)
He said that when looked back at
those 200 whatever-they-were
Sundays he didnt really miss the
Pantheon Cups or the girls or the
money or even the goddamned glory
What he missed were those other
guys looking back at him in the
huddle Those eleven guys --
their names he could hardly
remember -- but it was their faces
he remembered every one of ‘em
seeing things the same way
Looking downfield Together

(beat)

Thats what he missed Ill miss
you amigo

Tony pats Willie affectionately on the arm and walks off
Willies expression is gentle appreciative He drops
back three quick lithe steps and sails a long perfect
spiral down the empty field

He turns to look for Tony But hes already gone

TIME CUT TO

CHRISTINA

stands before the assembled press corps -- Coach DAmato
moving to her side on cue Nick Crozier sits close by
Margaret Pagniacci and the Mayor attend

CHRISTINA

(reading)
Thank you all for coming today
I guess youve heard all the
rumors about the Sharks leaving
for Los Angeles because Mayor
Smalls was reportedly unable to
get City Council approval for
stadium improvements

(as Smalls tightens)

-- but let me make this as clear
as I can to you We -- the Sharks
-- have no intention of leaving
Miami We love this town and we
love our Shark Stadium -- and we
will continue to remodel it at
whatever cost to make it a home
away from home for our fans

(looking pointedly at

the Mayor)
And we have great confidence at
the final hour that our Mayor will
be there for us

The Mayor accepts the applause but some in the press
mutter among themselves believing they know the real
story

( ) 312

CHRISTINA

-- You know I came to a
revelation recently I realized
how much I love this game and I
want to live up to what my father
left me a legacy a feeling
that this is our house -- the
Pagniacci house I am resolved
therefore to stick it out here in
Miami because the Pagniaccis
are not quitters and we will never
let this town down

As they applaud Christina turns to Margaret United
behind the family name they seem to have discovered
each other again

CHRISTINA
Nick
(sees Nick standing)
Nick Crozier -- our new Head

Coach Welcome

(as Crozier nods in

response to the

polite applause)
Tony D Thank you Always
Wherever you go know this you
will always be a Shark in your
heart You will always be
remembered with great respect and
love ‘Whatever it takes
right And Tony Thanks
for making me understand what Id
forgotten -- that football is more
than a game Its a way of life
Tony DAmato everybody give him
a hand

She hugs Tony as he steps to the podium

TONY
Thank you Christy I really am
sorry Ive not been able to
deliver to you and the fans
another Pantheon Cup San
Francisco sure took care of that
for me
(off good-natured
laughter )
Its been way too long not to win
the Big One But in football as
in life things change and fresh
blood is needed
(MORE )

( ) 312

TONY (CONTD)
(beat)

-- So I guess its time for me to
get the hell outta the way Bring
in the new I think Nick Crozier
is gonna do a great job

(nods to Crozier)

-- Most of all I wanna thank the
people of Miami for their long
support over these last 20-
something years Geez it flew
by like like any other Sunday
but its meant everything to me
and Ive had a great ride Too
good a ride for any one man Im
gonna miss you all Thank you

There is significant heartfelt applause from some not
all Rose in spite of himself is regretful to see his
nemesis depart muttering to a colleague

ROSE
Im gonna miss that arrogant
SOB
(studying Crozier)
Croziers a wimp compared to
DAmato

Tony acknowledges the applause about to leave the podium
-- but then seems to change his mind

TONY

- I almost forgot In thinking
about change I guess I felt it
was time for me to change too
Yknow like an old vampire I
need a new blood supply

(some laughter)
it was Willie Beamen who taught
me how to give it another shot

(as the press is

murmuring wondering)

-- So starting today I am
taking over as Head Coach of that
new expansion team in Albuquerque
New Mexico the Aztecs

(as a wave of

questions roll across

the balcony)
Why ‘Cause theyre giving me
full management control How can
I pass that up I guess the
bigger I get the more ridiculous

(MORE )

( ) 312

TONY (CONTD)
(off laughter)

- But hoping not to make a fool
out of myself out there I have
just signed Willie Beamen as
starting Quarterback and
franchise player for the
Aztecs

Now there is pandemonium on the veranda Christinas
expression drops crossed Crozier looks like hes going
to throw up Tony grins Thats the way it goes

TONY
So Miss P I look forward to
seeing you next year across those
sidelines and calling it what
it always was and still is a
ame Lets keep it that way
So long everybody

He waves and walks out -- leaving Christina and Crozier
to deal with a bewildered and upset press corps
