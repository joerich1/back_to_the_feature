She shakes her head no

quite caught up in air

sing whatever it is you want to
sing Theyll applaud like crazy
cause I can tell them that youre
really something and then the piano
and drum will give you a little
fanfare and you can sing and take
off your clothes or not sing It
really doesnt make much difference
really But since youve never done
this before singing might help

They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the
oven

TRIPLETTE
Now this is to raise funds for
someone who can help people who are
less fortunate than yourself The
more you take off you see more
money we can raise

There is a group groan BARNETT looks for some under-standing

but there is none There are several catcalls and GLENN who in

near BARNETT becomes so enraged he tries to find the caller

to waste your energy on that fool

He removes a pen and paper and writes down the following as he
speaks

BARNETT
She will not appear on the stage or
support that Walker guy and you
cant have any of his signs up while
she sings Shell be on first and
out of the park before he shows up
There will be no pictures no
questions no answers or tying her
name up with his now or in the
future to come Any money she makes

United States

He calls over his secretary and makes TRIPLETTE sign the
statement Then the secretary signs

BARNETT

after she starts and Walker better

BARNETT looks at him suspiciously

BARNETT

MAN

BABNETT sighs and skims over the paper Song stealing is the
same as horse stealing to BARNETT He becomes enraged

BARNETT
I dont know where you got this
but something tells me you stole it
and I hate thieves

The MAN takes the paper back and tries to walk away from him --
BARNETT yells after him

BARNETT
Arent you an engineer I know
you -- Dont you work at one of
those cut a record places

Twenty-five bucks a shot isnt it
Usually their last twenty-five

The MAN backs up and BARNETT follows him They have entered the
crowd The MAB starts to run BARNETT runs after him When the
MAN gets into the car BARNETT picks up a rock throws it and
hits the windshield with it The car MISFIRES but finally
starts As the MAN drives off BARNETT stands watching until
hes out of sight
