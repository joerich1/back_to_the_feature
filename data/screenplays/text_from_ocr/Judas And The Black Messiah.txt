INT WRIGHT JUNIOR COLLEGE - LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

The medium-sized hall is packed with students about 90
black Many wear dashikis headwraps and traditional
African garb FRED HAMPTON sits onstage behind a
COLLEGE STUDENT black female who addresses the
crowd from a podium Rush Harmon Palmer and Winters
stand at attention just off the stage

COLLEGE STUDENT
That reflected the population
and culture of an 80 black
student body So they’re bringing
in Dr Charles Hurst from Howard
University to be president and
they’re gonna call it Malcolm xX
College from now on

There’s big applause and affirmations Fred smirks

COLLEGE STUDENT
It’s in this spirit of activism
and on behalf of the Wright Junior
College Black Caucus that I’m
proud to introduce Fred Hampton
Deputy Chairman of the Illinois
Chapter of the Black Panther
Party

Fred takes her spot in front of the dais

DEBORAH JOHNSON Afro’d watches intently jotting
notes in a compact journal

FRED
Malcolm X College I can dig it
Dr Charles Hurst direct from
Howard Right on So what
You think the students over there
gon’ be free now

Some of the students’ joy begins to ebb

FRED
Oh they’1ll let you change the
name of your college or your own
name Throw on a dashiki ‘Cause
guess what They still gon’ drag
your black ass to Vietnam to shoot
a poor rice farmer or get shot
your damn-self That’s the
difference between revolution and
the candy-coated facade of gradual
reform Reform is just the
masters teaching the slaves how to
be better slaves Under reform
you could take the motherfucking
masters out and the slaves ‘still
be doing all the work for ‘em

The crowd listens rapt

FRED

There’s a man called a capitalist
Don’t matter what color he is
Black white brown red -- don’t
matter Because the capitalist
has one goal that is to exploit
the people He can have a three-
piece suit or a dashiki Because
political power doesn’t flow from
the sleeve of a dashiki

Political power flows from the
barrel of a gun We in the Black
Party don’t believe in no culture
except revolutionary culture What
we mean by that is a culture that
will free you Don’t give me no
five-and-dime costume of some
medicine man or witch doctor or
whatever you think the motherland
looks like Give me the righteous
threads of a Mozambican FRELIMO
fighter Give me an AK-47 or some
bandoliers like they got in
Angola Gimme some Colt 45s of
the folks that are trying to free
themselves

Fred expands his message to the pool hall at large
ONeal lingers in a corner hidden in the shadows

FRED
The Illinois Black Panther Party
has a mandate to feed every hungry
kid in Chicago And I’m not
talking ‘bout handing out turkeys
on Thanksgiving That’s charity
Save that for the pushers and the
preachers who call themselves
doing you a favor after they done
sucked you dry Fuck charity
The Black Panther Party believes
in progression Now what that
mean That means first you have
free breakfast then you have free
healthcare then you have free
education and next thing you
know you look up and you done
freed your motherfucking self

continues FOCUS ON 0O’Neal who observes ROD COLLINS whispering to a young man in a green beret who eyes
Fred menacingly The teen takes off his T-shirt and
starts gathering pool balls in it O’Neal’s eyes widen
Collins intones --

You know where you at
motherfucker This is Crowns
territory

FRED
We don’t want no trouble brother
We just passing through
‘Sides the rap we on is a
political one It shouldnt
really concern y’all

shirt gesture to another man also in a green beret who
flips his pool cue around weaponizing it They creep
towards Fred O’Neal grabs a pool stick and moves
quickly

COLLINS
Nigga don’t lecture me on
politics The Crowns protected
Martin Luther King when he was
here in 1966

FRED
And he got his head split open
Damn near killed by a mob of
crackers throwing Irish confetti
Bang-up job y’all did

Just then the teens make their move to strike but ONeal
pushes Fred aside and swinging his pool stick wildly
creates a perimeter

O’NEAL
Hey Hey Get the fuck back

Collins pulls a pistol from his waistband and trains it
at O’Neal Everyone freezes

ten Crowns wielding rifles and pistols Collins anda
cluster of Crowns lead the Panthers up a darkened
staircase They’re trailed by more armed Crowns The
lights are off and it’s hard to see only adding to the
Panthers’ sense of discomfort

They reach the MAIN FLOOR and approach a lone figure
sitting on the edge of a raised stage STEEL He
loads a machine gun while smoking a cigarette The
Crowns who led the Panthers upstairs take the front of
the room with Steel including Collins and Tex The
Crown who almost cut O’Neal’s throat O’Neal doesn’t
notice focused not just on Steel’s machine gun but the

revealing a slight bump and looks up at Fred with a
hopeful smile He laughs in disbelief The gravity of
the moment only amplifies his happiness

leads her to O’Neal’s idling CAR

bottomed jeans a turtleneck and longshoreman’s cap

Fred emerges from the church’s rear and strides down the
aisle to thunderous applause Flanking him in the front
and rear are O’Neal and members of the security cadre
They stand below the stage a stoic contrast to the
frenzied crowd Hanging behind them is a banner that
reads “WELCOME HOME CHAIRMAN FRED” Deborah looks on

A contingent of Crowns including Rod Collins and Steel

Put a fist in the air for comrade
Jimmy Palmer

Rev mmddyy (Tan) 80

Most of the audience members raise their fists in the
air Mitchell not among them He grows cross as he looks
at the same blonde white girl he eyed before her fist
raised enthusiastically

Fist in the sky O’Neal nods vigorously with every
proclamation Fred makes Something is happening to him
in this moment Something unexpected and jarring Maybe
it’s Palmer’s death or the experience of rebuilding
headquarters or Fred putting an arm around him earlier
But for the first time the Chairman’s words are
penetrating O’Neal’s cold soul

FRED
Jimmy Palmer died a revolutionary
death He stood face-to-face and
toe-to-toe with pig Daley’s
henchman and made the greatest
sacrifice one can ever make

The crowd cheers

ONEAL
Right on

O’Neal zeros in on the few audience members whose fists
aren’t in the air He locks eyes with Mitchell His jaw
almost hits the floor His handler is in this very
moment looking him in the eyes a witness to this sudden
ideological conversion
FRED

I don’t believe I was born to die

in a car wreck I don’t believe

I’m going to die slipping on

ON DEBORAH
unsure how to feel about what she’s hearing

FRED
-- I don’t believe I’m gonna die

FRED
-Kill a few pigs and get a
little satisfaction

Mitchell reacts

FRED
Kill some more and you get some
more satisfaction Kill ‘em all
and you get complete satisfaction

The crowd cheers

FRED
It’s not a question of violence or
non-violence It’s a question of
resistance to fascism or non-
existence within fascism You can
murder a liberator but you can’t

you have to make You get to go
up there and talk about dying a
revolutionary death and how your
body belongs to the revolution
because you don’t have another
person growing inside your body
