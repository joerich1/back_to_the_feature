INT MABRY BARN — DAY 1

The door slides open and MADYLYN in her 20s a petite
tarttaciturn woman holds a cigarette

Her 4 year old daughter CANDACE charges in

CANDACE
Look look

JACK mid 20s enters laden with a cigarette between his
teeth He’s wiry strong intense Black hair slicked up and
back Very sure of himself

MADYLYN
Good lord in heaven Its really
falling apart

JACK
Let it rot God damn waste of space
anyway

They glance about the huge empty space - as Candace runs
around the rusting abandoned remnants of a once thriving
dairy barn rattling off the wonders

CANDACE
A tractorand lots of hay

Madylyn and Jack stand side by side in the doorway They both
take slow drags and then turn to each other and smile

EXT MABRY YARD - DAY 2

Jack and Candace jump and run in the fields of tall grass
bordering the house and barns

Jack does a comic fall backwards in the grass - and
disappears Candace giggles and tries to copy him Madylyn
watches - smokes

surrounding barns

farmer and his daddy was a farmer
too

his head but keeps his cigarette in his

teeth Candace closes her eyes but sneaks a peek at her
parents during the prayer

MADYLYN
Bless oh Lord these gifts to our
use and us to Thy loving
service

Jack opens one eye and catches Candace and bumps his eyebrows
and she laughs and shuts her eyes quickly Madylyn knows what
has happened and smiles without opening her eyes

MADYLYN (CONTD)
In Christs name Amen

JACK
Amen
CANDACE
»-And Amen

He stops her with a look “Don’t contradict me” But she eyes
him evenly

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
She wants to try

He stares at her more pissed than he should be Madylyn
holds the plank steady as Candace struggles to run the saw
back and forth across it The blade falls off

CANDACE
Oh

Like I said

He turns his back on Madylyn and scoops up Candace and walks
off Madylyn stares at him

It’s ok honey
She sits on the edge of the bed and strokes her kids
shoulder sipping her drink She stares out the open
window doesn’t notice the BEE crawling across the shut
screen She moves to sip and stops hand trembling the
tiniest bit Her eyes are wet booze or emotionhard to
say
The SOUND OF THE BEE is just a little bit louder turning
into a VIBRATION
INT MABRY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 9
Jack watches golf in a chair in front of the TV Madylyn
stumbles into the room She stands staring at him at the
back of his head

almost a TUNING FORK now Madylyn slugs the last of her
drink trembling
MADYLYN
Look at me
Jack glances at her
MADYLYN (CONTD)
I’m not standing for this
Jack only semi breaks from the golf half-hearing Looks back
to her in a glance eyes still on the game
JACK

He looks at her nowquizzical
MADYLYN (CONT’‘D)

He stares at her and she stares back He gets up and walks
toward her not fast but she retreats a stepand he just
walks past her and up the stairs

MADYLYN (CONTD)
Jack do you hear me

Suddenly Madylyn races upstairs

INT JACK AND MADYLYN’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 9A

Jack pushes up the window trapping the BEE between the glass
panes

He turns back and lifts a sleeping Candace as Madylyn rushes
into the room Jack kicks out the screen and HOLDS THEIR
SLEEPING CHILD OUT OVER THE DROP Madylyn freezes

JACK
You mean it Huh If you leave
meI’ll do it

MADYLYN
Jack

JACK
You think that I wont You think I
wont

His voice is like a punch but there is pain and fear in his
face

THE SOUND is rising all around Madylyn engulfing vibrating
in waves Terrifying She trembles

And then she breaks Tears pour from her eyes and she moves
to him with arms outstretched to embrace him He places
Candace on the bed and Madylyn shuts the window quickly
SHUTTING OUT THE SOUND Jack grabs Madylyn in an embrace
almost sobbing

JACK (CONTD)

Hosts Praise Father Son and Holy

Jack his hair now gray has retained the vestiges of
unforced virility but as he sits back down in the pew he
sighs deeply from a heaviness that he rides and doesn’t deal
with Because there’s not time and he has other things to
do

He reaches over and takes his wife’s hand in his as the
service continues He seems unsettled - collar too tight

pamphlet and a book at the same time cross referencing
between them We might see part of the word ZUKANGOR on it

STONE

(reading softly aloud)
Light and Sound are the twin
aspects through which we know Gods
Truth The Light is consuming Fire
the Sound is terrifying but for one
who experiences these twin pillars
life becomes fresh and new again
Through Zuk he is purified of
karma sin He gains wisdom
charity and Freedom

He considers this

She offers the peeled egg He hesitates

LUCETTA (CONTD)
My kids did ’em Now I’m stuck with
‘em so I got to eat ’em all Salt

Salt and pepper They‘re nice

She sprinkles some of each on top and then gently blows the
excess off Hands it to him He eats it awkward self
conscious as she watches

LUCETTA
Well don‘t be shy just eat the
whole thing

He pops the whole thing in his mouth and pretends to swallow
holding it in his cheek She gasps and then he brings it
back out between his teeth and she laughs hard
She holds out second egg waving it at him
LUCETTA (CONTD)

Jack and Lucetta standing a few feet apart Jack stands with
his feet slightly wide still And she watches him intently
His eyes are closed

A tingling

JACK
No I don’t think I

a beer and sips her own

Lucetta gets closer to Jack Jack scoots his feet around
some trying to feel the magnetic insoles’ effect

LUCETTA
It’s not dramatic Just a sense

JACK
Maybe Yeah A little something

She smiles aware of the effect she has on him She comes so
close her body is against his side - still swaying to the
music

LUCETTA

JACK
Couldn’t hurt I guess
LUCETTA
Nothing wrong with feeling right

INT PRISON - HALLWAYSHOLDING ROOMCOMMON AREA - EVENING 84

GUARD 2 unlocks a door into a holding area Stone glances
down the hallway and notices TWO WHITE INMATES on work detail
acting strangely looking past him

He turns follows their look to A BLACK INMATE approaching in
the opposite direction pushing a LINEN CART

Stone is ushered into a holding cell to await infirmary

Stone holds the bars leaning heavy on them looking into the
florescent drab space as the BLACK INMATE on work detail
enters with the cart and enters an adjacent room OTHER
INMATES DRIFT BY outside in the hallway

THE LIGHTS BUZZ growing louder but fracturing in fizzes and
pops STONE raises his head as though he is listening Sound
is chaotic and disorienting

STONE’S POV through the bars beyond the BLACK INMATE THE
TWO WHITE POWER INMATES ARE APPROACHING FAST

STONE sharpens up and the HUM gets LOUDER

INT LUCETTAS APARTMENT - EVENING 85
THE SOUND is rising

Lucetta playfully brings her lips close to the nape of Jacks
neck as she moves her body around him She giggles and
breathes on Jack - sort of ‘acting’ the part of a seduction
He laughs at the ‘performance’ but is affected

INT PRISON - HOLDING CELLCOMMON AREA - CONTINUOUS 86

THE TWO WHITE POWER INMATES ENTER AND ATTACK In a flash they
are on the BLACK INMATE one cold-cocking him with an elbow

as the other pulls the door closed jamming it shut with a
broom handle The black inmate is thrown to the floor and is
STABBED repeatedly with a shiv

STONE Watching through the bars - the action inches from his
face

INT LUCETTAS APARTMENT - EVENING 87

Lucetta touches Jack taking his wrist He doesn’t move
looks at where she is holding him and his gaze moves along
the arm to her body He moves around to face her she lifts
his other hand places it around her

JACK
My God Help me

THE SOUND is actually pulsing now like a tuning fork

INT PRISON - HOLDING CELLCOMMON AREA - EVENING 88

STONE DROPS TO THE FLOOR - watching through the bars The
guy being stabbed is literally a foot away from Stone face
screwed up in agony trying to cover up with his one free arm
as blows rain in on his kidneys and neck and head PEOPLE
ARE SHOUTING

The arm with the shiv whips across in between Stone and the
guy wrapping around to strike him in the throat

THE SOUND OF THE BLOWS AND THE CURSING BEGIN TO MUTE

HE WATCHES ALL THE CHAOTIC NOISE IS FADING

into the room separating bodies and checking the guy’s

on his face listening He looks up

smiles

to obey God based on Do’s and
Donts or on a true love for Him”

(she considers)
Hmm “In what recent circumstance
was I aware of God’s leading Did
it differ from what I wanted or
expected from God”Hmm

She looks at Jack He’s waiting for her to say a blessing

MADYLYN (CONTD)
Why don’t you say the blessing

Startled a bit he nods

JACK
Bless oh Lord
(has to clear throat)
Bless oh Lord this food to our
use and us to Thy loving service
And make us ever mindful of the
needs of others -

ON JACK his jaw muscle pulsing slowly trying to find words
A CICADA is BUZZINGa LOW HUM

MADYLYN (0S)
Did you know you started out as
stone

He turnsdid he hear that right

JACK
What’d you say

Madylyn is reading a pamphlet from the mail stack

MADYLYN

Your soul It started out as a
mineral or a pebble And then it
was reincarnated as a plant then
as a fishbirds animals and so
on You had to work your way up to
being human You know what it’s
been doingyour soul

He’s looking at that pamphlethe knows it We can see a
piece of the word “ZUKANGOR” on it

JACK
What

MADYLYN
It’s been paying off debts Past
sins from past lives reducing its
burden from one life to the next

JACK
Until
MADYLYN
Until “you are cleansed by Sound
and Light and see your true
Nature”

She tosses it down dismissively Jack is paranoid

JACK
(trying to be casual)
Where’d you get that

MADYLYN

Junk mail Better than those
people at the door I guess

(sips)
You know what I think

(looks at Jack)
I think we get this one life I do
And you account for what youve
done in it here and if you don’t
you pay for it when you die
Forever

JACK
Ah shit

MADYLYN
You don’t think

He shakes his head That’s not what he meanshe’s

struggling to speak She looks away
JACK
Mad there’s something I want to
say
MADYLYN
Mm

She takes a slow breath and turns to him waiting for it

JACK

this)

He nodssighs

JACK

MADYLYN
You did what you thought was right
That’s all you can do The rest

is in Gods hands

Madylyn takes a deep drag They may have found a way past all
thisthey can both feel it Enough to invest in the same
interpretation of these events

JACK
Shit

He shifts his weight

MADYLYN
Your back

JACK
Yeah my goddamn back

She takes a deep drag on her cigarette

MADYLYN
Your damn back

He cracks a slight smile and glances at her She doesn’t look
back

MADYLYN (CONT’D)
“Hell” “Damn” “Shit”

He laughs a little at her ribbing
MADYLYN (CONTD)

“Shit” “Son of a bitch”
oe “Puck”

JACK
Okay okay I got it

MADYLYN

“Motherfucker” Make me another

This gets him laughing
JACK
(laughs)
Shit
They start almost really laughingand then hear

SOUND OF A CAR SLOWING IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

MADYLYN is rising to go make drinks and she turns and Jack
looks up to see

LUCETTA GETTING OUT OF HER CAR AND COMING ACROSS THE YARD
Jack is frozen for just one beat watching her come

Seeing Lucetta something in Madylyn’s face changesa
knowing

MADYLYN
Who is that

LUCETTA
(calling out)
Hello

MADYLYN
Is that her Should you

JACK
No Ill take care of it

And he’s movingstriding off the porch and down onto the
grass to intercept her

JACK (CONTD)
(so Madylyn can hear)
Mrs Creesonpleasereally

He reaches her and moves to get between her and Madylyn In
what follows Madylyn can see Jack‘s back and glimpses of
Lucetta but can‘t see Jack’s face or hear all of it

JACK (CONT’D)
(sotto -— deadly)
Have you lost your fucking mind-

LUCETTA
I’ve been a little worried Jack -
you haven’t returned any of my
calls and -

JACK
(louder)
I know you’re worried I
understand

Lucetta sidesteps enough to see Madylyn and be seen by her

LUCETTA
Hi Mrs Mabry

Jack moves to counter her and grabs her other wrist blocked
from Madylyn’s view He leads her toward the car

MADYLYN’S POV Lucetta winces a little and looks down
reacting to something Madylyn steps forward against the
rail jaw tightening

JACK
(sotto fast)
I’m done were done Get in the
car and drive

LUCETTA
(tearing up a little)
I don’t know why you’re being like
this why Stone’s acting so weird
What did you tell him about us

JACK
(sotto - murderous)
There is no “us” Get out of here

MADYLYN’S POV they seem to be talking - is she resisting his
grip Is he tightening it and forcibly moving her along

ON MADYLYN’S FACE Something dying in her eyes
Lucetta separates from Jack and gets in the car
LUCETTA

I just needed to talk - I thought
we were friends

Jack stands staring daggers at her Hate Still and unmoving
making sure she starts the engine and drives Watching
locked on the car as it drives away

And then he walks back to the porch Madylyn is waiting for
him examining him

He mounts the steps feeling Madylyn’s glare

MADYLYN
She was upset

JACK
Theres no excusecoming to my
home

He’s at the door

MADYLYN
You don’t have to be cruel do you

He turns on herin his face an expression she hasn’t seen
in quite some timehe barely pulls it back

He goes inside

Jack is still standing by the door behind Stone He reacts
something in the hall

to

He goes back behind his desk and composes himself

Lucetta suddenly appears in the doorway behind Jack with the
guard Dickerson

Jack turns - really rattled by her appearance

JACK (CONT‘D)
Ms Creeson

Lucetta has dark circles under her eyes and stares at Jack
with ill-concealed disdain

Stone standing smiles at her

Lucetta glances at Stone who is beaming relaxed Lucetta
does not even smile at him She bites her lip Uncertain

JACK (CONTD)
Happy day

All three are in a new untried place all awkward

LUCETTA
(softly)
You ready

STONE
You bet

She stares at him sick of this and wary of what it may mean
in her life

He smiles at her benignly - a different Stone than she knows
Clear-eyed He turns to Jack

STONE (CONTD)
Can I kiss her

Jack nods Stone moves oddly to her - it’s been years She
wonders - is he shorter than when he went in

They kiss But not really connecting
LUCETTA
(Cold almost sad)
Ready to go home

STONE
Oh yeah f want barbeque

JACK
(forcing a smile)
Well Good luck to you Stone

Stone turns and extends his hand to Jack Jack takes it
reluctantly Stone holds it longer than necessary and Jack
awkwardly disengages

STONE
Thanks for all youve done

JACK
Good luck to you too Ms Creeson

LUCETTA
Lucetta Jackplease Were all
friends now right

She and Stone stare at him He can’t read between the lines
and he’s sweating now

JACK
Lucetta Take good care of him
LUCETTA
Oh I will And listen you take
good care too old man

She goes out into the hall and follows Dickerson

DICKERSON
You make a damn good cookie honey

Stone starts after them and Jack starts to let out a breath
relieved Then Stone steps back into the door and into the
room

STONE
Oh I meant to sayLucetta told
me you fucked her

Jack stands frozen Does not respond or betray anything

STONE (CONTD)
That‘s got to be against some kind
of rules around here

Madylyn lightly pushes the eggs away and finishes her drink

Jack looks at her - daring her to pick up the bottle She
picks up “Daily Devotions” booklet

MADYLYN

Ohokayum

(Reads)
“The glory revealed to Moses is not
God‘s bodily splendor but that of
his moral being Moses’s immediate
response is submission and
worship”

(She clears her smoker’s

throat)
“BR vision of the glory of God often
has that effect”

This strikes her funny and she chuckles

MADYLYN (CONTD)
- I’ll bet Um
(Reads silently)
SO we’re getting to the
commandments next I guess huh

She takes a sip from her already empty glass She looks up at
him watching her

MADYLYN (CONT’D)

He stops She stares at him hard Hands him the book

MADYLYN
You read the meditation

He takes it and reads

JACK
“What request is on the top of my
prayer list for today Is it a
selfish request Or one that will
bring God glory After I yield
myself to the Lord like Moses
will my “top request” be
changed”

He stops with the book open

You don’t remember it You loved
playing in the water with your
father

CANDACE
I love that shag carpet

A long beat as they watch Katie

CANDACE (CONT’D)
Don’t know how you stuck it out as
long as you did I can’t believe
you didn’t do this sooner

MADYLYN
I almost did Once

CANDACE
What happened

Madylyn doesn’t answer Just smokes
MADYLYN

You have a limited point of view
It got better Gentler

Candace looks at her mother Madylyn stares off into the
middle distance

CANDACE
What are you thinking

MADYLYN
I hope he’s eating

Candace groans and gets up to go inside

CANDACE
I’m monitoring your calls

She leaves her mother Madylyn stares and thinks
The faint SOUND OF A BEE starts -rising
AND WE HEAR A MAN’S VOICE BEGIN TO SPEAK Inarticulate and
Strange struggling to find the wordsthe voice runs over
the following scenes
MANS VOICE (V0)
IT ain’t knowhow can I know
INT LUCETTA’S APARTMENT - SUNDAY MORNING 161
Stone is packing a small duffel bag No Lucetta
MAN’S VOICE (V0)
Ain’t nobody come into this place
and want to stay the same That I
know for sure
EXT CITY ROAD - CONTINUOUS 162

Stone with duffel bag looking around

A POWER LINE IS HUMMING merging with that SOUND FROM THE
BEE growing subtly

MANS VOICE (V0O)
Do I deserve to be free

INT BAR SUNDAY MORNING 163
Lucetta in a bar Bartender brings a drink and points to a

guy down the bar He nods at Lucetta She gives her siren
smile

Theres a neon bar sign BUZZING

MAN’S VOICE (V0)
Up to me I say I do I want to be
I hope to be

EXTINT PRISON - SUNDAY MORNING 164

Jack arrives at the complex he’s made into his life Entering
the outside Walking down a hall with a cardboard box in his
hand

MAN’S VOICE (VO)
But I don’t know

INT PRISON JANICE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 165

Over the shoulder of JANICE we see an INMATE discussing
himself and we see that this is the man who has been talking
in VOICE OVER

In the open door behind him Jack crosses with the boxhe
pauses only slightly to look in on the Inmate speaking then
moves on

INMATE

I don’t know who get to make that
decision you know

INT PRISON - JACK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 166

Entering he sets the box on his desk and surveys everything
that made up his life And then he starts to box it up

“

EXT CANDACE’S BACKYARD - SUNDAY MORNING 16
Madylyn sits staring smoking and thinking

The BUZZING LOUDER NOW

INT BEDROOM SOMEWHERE - SUNDAY MORNING 168
Lucetta sits naked on the edge of a bed A mans body out of
focus behind her Shes happily painting her toenails and
smoking Takes a drag and stares into space

The SOUND rising

EXT ROAD - CONTINUOUS 169

Weird light Getting out into the empty spaces beyond a
city But not beautiful Neutral uncertain

STONE is walking along the road under power lines humming
Unreadable Impossible to tell where hes going or what hes
doing

The Sound now powerfully vibrating

INT PRISON - JACK’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 170

Wide on Jack behind his desk with a box on it room stripped
bare and empty Jacks life is dismantled and packed up in
boxes There is one last picture frame on the desk We cant
see what it is He picks it up and packs it up looking down
into the box He stands there head down lost in thought

The SOUND is LOUDER NOW CLEARER VIBRATING

Almost unconsciously Jack turns his head towards the sound
Just barely

THE END
