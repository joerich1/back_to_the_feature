PROLOGUE

This film is based on events that occurred
in El Salvador in 1980-82 For narrative purposes
the time frame of these events has been condensed
and some events have been combined without --
the filmmakers believe -- violating the spirit
of that time Living characters have been
fictionalized

With lies they tried

to make us lie

As if they did not know
that the mouth was
made to say -

than 1000 people have “disapvoeared” many
of them found murdered in ditches and
dumping grounds along roads outside the

The sun sets

gracious and Jithe theyve just made loveReina the
tittle girl crawling up Richards belly Duglas watching
cartoons on the black and white TV A moment of pure peace
for Richard -- a sort of King with his adopted family

We dwell on his face as Maria strokes it

A big ugly toad in the shadows croaks out a song Duglas
shrieks points

RICHARD
Is that you Major Max You still
watching the house

Maria giggles like a little girl they tickle each other

the moment interrupted as Rock and CARLOS Marias 15 year-old
brother bang into the house his radio blaster playing

Hes a sharp little hippie in an LA Rams tee-shirt and

a Grateful Dead hat he talks an outdated slang As he

gives Boyle their old handshake

CARLOS
Hey Ricardo you back from the dead man
I like your friend Doctor Rock man
he knows rock and roll

(grabbing Boyles Nikon)
Ooooh -- look at those tits

Clicking off a picture of Maria and Richard in the hammock

he knows how to use the camera She shrieks innocent about

her body whipping on a towel on her pubic area but her

breasts are still exposed She runs off the hammock into
