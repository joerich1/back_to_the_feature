ON A STEEL HORSE I RIDE

by
Reed Agnew and Eli Jorné
INT PHARMACY - DAY

ANGLE ON A shelf filled with Slick Chest hair removal foam
in several different scents watermelon musk leather etc

A bronzed muscular ARM reaches into frame and points to each
label as if the shopper is considering his options We can’t
help but notice a big tattoo on the forearm of JON BON JOVI’S
FACE with Gothic lettering underneath it that reads “JOVI”

As if to say “Fuck it” the arm just sweeps the entire
contents of the shelf into a shopping cart

ANGLE ON A shelf filled with Beach King fake tanning spray

The same arm once again reaches into frame and sweeps
everything on the shelf into the shopping cart

ANGLE ON A shelf filled with tubes of Sensational Spikes
Super Hold sculpting gel

The arm sweeps every tube into the shopping cart
ANGLE ON A display rack of Stallion Noir cologne

Again the arm sweeps every bottle into the cart We finally
pull out to reveal RICHIE 26 the guy attached to this
beautiful arm Richie’s fake tan is almost orange and his
spiked hair looks like a gleaming wet sea urchin He is
wearing a wife-beater a Tommy Hilfiger sweatband and
designer jeans with fake gems glued to them

Richie rolls his shopping cart up to the checkout counter
next to a magazine stand He looks around to make sure no one
is watching then picks up a copy of National Geographic He
flips through it clearly mesmerized by the photos of distant
rainforests and colorful exotic animals

STEVE (0S)
What the fuck you reading

Richie turns to see his best friend STEVE 27 approaching
Like Richie Steve is also ripped He has no shirt on a
shaved chest and a thin perfectly groomed “chin strap” beard
A giant tattoo across his pecs reads “LIVIN’ ON A PRAYER”
Everybody speaks with a THICK ABRASIVE NEW JERSEY ACCENT

Embarrassed Richie tries to hide the magazine

RICHIE
Nothing Hey they were out of
Brilliant Bod so I got Slick Chest
hair removal foam It moisturizes
as it dissolves the hair
Steve grabs the magazine from Richie and looks it over

STEVE
National Geographic Richie
everyone knows the tits in there
are fuckin’ brown bananas You
wanna see some nice tits Check out
blimp chest right here

Steve points to the FEMALE CASHIER She has high teased bangs
and a tight employee shirt that sags under the weight of her
fat breasts She gives Steve a dirty look and rolls her eyes

FEMALE CASHIER
You can’t be in here without a
shirt on

STEVE
Are you kidding me Today is the
first day of summer I’m waxed I’m
bronzed and you have the gall to
ask me not to showcase my fuckin’
chest rocks This is Jersey baby

Steve flexes his chest

EXT JERSEY SHORE BOARDWALK - MOMENTS LATER

Richie and Steve exit the pharmacy They stop for a moment
and take in their surroundings a long boardwalk a crowded
beach and the Atlantic Ocean disappearing into the horizon

RICHIE
Hey Steve what if we were born in
the mountains Or like down in the
rainforest with all those weird-ass
frogs and shit You think our lives
would still be as intense as this

STEVE
Fuck no We’re blessed Richie The
Jersey Shore in summertime is the
ultimate fuck zone It’s like the
center of the Universe

ANGLE ON Seagulls swarming around a half-eaten rotten
hotdog on the ground

ANGLE ON A chick in a bikini rollerblading down the
boardwalk with two grapefruit sized tits that look like they
were installed by the worst plastic surgeon on Earth
ANGLE ON An obese ugly 12-year-old kid playing skee-ball
He throws a skee-ball directly at the center like a baseball
practically breaking the machine

ANGLE ON A sleazy middle-aged guy wearing only a Speedo and
a T-shirt that reads “EAT MY BALLS”

Suddenly BOBBY 22 dashes up to Steve and Richie out of
breath He is skinny to the point where his wife-beater looks
loose on him He is wearing huge old lady sunglasses and a
baseball hat with the brim pulled down low over his face

BOBBY
Guys I got the craziest news

STEVE
Bobby what the fuck are you
wearing

RICHIE
Yeah what’s with the cap and the
goofy glasses You look like a
fuckin’ child molester

BOBBY
What It’s sunny out

STEVE
Take that shit off Lemme see

Bobby reluctantly takes off his hat and glasses to reveal a
BLACK EYE and a fresh LACERATION on his forehead

BOBBY
Okay listen up You’re never gonna
believe this--

STEVE
Jesus What happened to your face

BOBBY
Nothing I just banged my eyes and
forehead on the refrigerator door

RICHIE
Bobby just admit it Your
girlfriend is abusive

BOBBY
No you got it all wrong Crystals

shes even thinking about getting D-
cup bazooms put in for me Anyway--
RICHIE
But that’s not gonna stop her from--

BOBBY
All right shut the fuck up
Listen This is fuckin’ important

Steve and Richie go silent taken aback by Bobby’s alarm

BOBBY (CONTD)
Bon Jovi’s retiring

STEVE
What

BOBBY
He’s doing one last concert at the
Meadowlands August 15th After
that he’s done

Steve and Richie share a look of horrified disbelief

STEVE
Fuckin’ fuck Really

RICHIE
I thought Jovi was gonna tour till
he dies

BOBBY
Fuckin’ insane right I just heard
it on the radio Says he wants to
spend more time with his family or
some retarded shit like that

STEVE
Well then fuck This is it If
this is Jovi’s last show then we
are definitely getting inside the
Meadowlands this time No more
listening from the parking lot

A girl with an ugly face and a hot body strolls by Steve
reaches out and quickly fingers her over her shorts She

smiles and flirtatiously slaps his hand away Steve keeps
talking to Richie and Bobby like nothing happened

STEVE (CONTD)
When do tickets go on sale

BOBBY
This weekend But the line at Beach
Bargain Records is already four
blocks long
RICHIE
Think your brother can hook us up

BOBBY
Only one way to find out

EXT JERSEY SHORE BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

“BIG NIGHT OUT” 44 is lying sprawled out on an inflatable
mattress in the middle of the beach Despite his age he is
still bulging with muscles beneath his tan leathery sun

damaged skin He is wearing only boxers covered in Playboy
bunnies Dozens of crushed beer cans surround the mattress

Steve Richie and Bobby walk up to him He slowly wakes up

STEVE
Big Night Out what the fuck

BIG NIGHT OUT
(sitting up)
Aw man Another big night out
Gotta live up to the name right

RICHIE
What happened to you last night We
lost you at Club Sexorcist

BIG NIGHT OUT
Dude I met this chick on the dance
floor Took her down to the beach
here She was so fuckin’ hot We
started out on the old fuck mat
then quickly moved onto the shallow
surf And when the salt water
started stinging her pussy we
finished on the lifeguard stand

ANGLE ON The red lifeguard stand is completely broken and
splintered all over the beach

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)

She’s around here somewhere
(looking around)

Roberta Roberta

ANGLE ON About 50 feet away a scantily clad woman passed
out with her face in the sand She gradually sits up to
reveal that she is a really ugly haggard 65-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

Richie Steve and Bobby look disgusted Big Night Out holds
out his hand for a high-five
BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
Cougar alert

Bobby reluctantly slaps five with Big Night Out

BOBBY
You know it’s amazing to me that
we share the same mother

BIG NIGHT OUT
Well Bobby our mother was a very
different person when she had me A
lot changes in a woman’s life
between the ages of 12 and 32

STEVE
So Big Night Out guess who’s
hanging up his snakeskin boots Bon
fuckin’ Jovi Finished Retired

BIG NIGHT OUT
Don’t fuck with me Steve

RICHIE
He’s not kidding It’s for real

Big Night Out mournfully places his hand on his chest

BIG NIGHT OUT
Holy shit It’s like there’s a
stupid fuckin’ dark cloud forming
around my heart

STEVE
But get this he’s doing one final
concert at the Meadowlands and
we’re getting in no matter what
Remember that Jovi roadie you met a
few months back He can score us

BOBBY

STEVE
Anne Maskowitz is not an option
RICHIE
Lemme ask Dom at work I think his
cousin’s got a hook-up

A SEAGULL suddenly lands right next to the mattress

BIG NIGHT OUT
Oh Richie Perfect opportunity Do

RICHIE

when we were kids but I’m thinking
about retiring the bird thing

STEVEBIG NIGHT OUTBOBBY

RICHIE
(sighing)
Okay But this is the last time

Richie steps toward the seagull The seagull starts to fly
away But before it can fully take flight Richie PUNCHES the
seagull out of the air with his fist There is an explosion
of white feathers Steve Bobby and Big Night Out CHEER

EXT USA PIZZA - DAY

This is a hole in the wall pizza shop on the boardwalk
Richie hurries in while pulling his “USA PIZZA” employee T-
shirt over his dangerously spiky hair and glorious body

INT USA PIZZA - CONTINUOUS

Richie rushes in to see the manager DOM 29 making pizzas
Dom is an extremely dark-skinned AFRICAN AMERICAN with hair
straightened and sculpted into a Jersey style pompadour He
wears an Italian horn necklace Although he looks like a
Kenyan marathon runner he speaks with a thick JERSEY ACCENT

DOM
Oh paizan Look who decides to
show up We just got a 5 pie order

RICHIE
Sorry I’m late Dom I’1l get
started on those pizzas right away

DOM
By the way you’re lucky you didn’t
work last night

(MORE )
DOM (CONTD)
These two fuckin’ moulinyans showed
up Totally nigged me on the tip
Vaffanculo

Dom flicks his fingers off the bottom of his chin Richie
gives Dom a confused look Does this guy realize he’s black
Richie goes behind the counter and ties on an apron

RICHIE
Hey my friends and I need some
Jovi tickets Your cousin still
know that guy

DOM
Inky Yeah he gave Richie Sambora
his first tattoo lipstick kissy
lips on his hairy ass cheek
Beautiful fuckin’ job I bet Inky
could call in a favor from Sambora

Richie begins rolling out some pizza dough dispassionately
He notices a poster on the wall depicting beautiful beaches
and exotic ruins The caption reads “SICILY”

RICHIE

Dom can I ask you a question
DOM

Sure
RICHIE

Do you ever get tired of doing the
same shit over and over again

DOM
Yeah maybe if I lived on a farm
But we live at the Shore Beaches
and bitches Jersey baby Oh

Dom tosses some pizza dough up into the air

INT RICHIE’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

This is the house where Richie was raised and is still being

raised There are family pictures all over the walls a beat-
up plaid couch a La-Z-Boy recliner and one of those TV sets

with drawers that’s more like a piece of wooden furniture

Richie is eating dinner with his parents RON and MAUREEN
mid 40’s Ron is a typical working class American Maureen is
wearing an oversized Giants T-shirt Her huge perm is dyed an
unnatural color of red and she is smoking a Virginia Slim
RON
First day of summer huh Richie

MAUREEN
Ron Not at the table

RON
What You were a hot piece of
boardwalk slit once Why do you
think I put a baby up in you

MAUREEN
(blushing)
Oh stop it

Maureen lovingly takes Ron’s hand

RICHIE
I hit the boardwalk in the morning
But then I had to work

RON
USA Pizza Now that’s a good
steady job Richie

RICHIE
It’s okay But I was thinking
maybe next summer I could get a job
up in the city Like Cousin John

MAUREEN
Your cousin John is a fuckin’
weirdo Not to mention probably
half a fag

RON
Richie there’s a lot of valuable
life lessons to be learned from
working at USA Pizza Tossing
the dough Putting the red sauce
down on there Listening to what
toppings they said and then
remembering it and getting it
right I remember when I used to
work there I even remember your
grandfather working there way back
when it was just called US Pizza

MAUREEN
That was before they added the A

RON
(tapping his temple)
Innovations

Richie nods unenthusiastically

MAUREEN
All right everybody let’s drink
up our milk before it gets warm

They all pick up shot glasses filled with Jagermeister and
drop them into their milk glasses They pound the milk down

INT RICHIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

This is Richie’s childhood bedroom There is a poster of a
chick with huge perfect tits lying on the hood of a red Trans-
Am Another poster is the enlarged album cover of Bon Jovi’s
Livin’ on a Prayer Richie enters yelling up the hall

RICHIE
Yeah I’m fuckin’ beat Good night
Ma See you in the morning

Richie shuts the door He turns on a stereo beside his bed
and a FEMALE VOICE with a FRENCH ACCENT accidentally blares
out of the speakers Richie quickly nervously turns down the
volume He lies down on his bed listening to the voice

FRENCH WOMAN’S VOICE
Where is the railway station Ou
est la gare

We realize this is one of those foreign language tapes
Whispering Richie repeats the phrase in his thick accent

RICHIE
Ou est la gare

FRENCH WOMANS VOICE
What time does the train leave
A quelle heure part le train

- RICHIE
A quelle heure part le train

EXT TATTOO PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

Bobby is standing on the sidewalk smoking MOLLY 25
understatedly cute walks up to him holding a map She is
wearing glasses khaki shorts and leather sandals She has
the look of a modestly dressed out-of-town vacationer

MOLLY

pulls over to the curb and SCREECHES to a halt

BOBBY
Oh fuck You should get outta

MOLLY

Bobby sprints off down the street CRYSTAL 21 a petite
51’ Jersey girl with teased bangs and orange skin wearing a
tube-top exits the car and gets right up in Molly’s face

CRYSTAL
Hey What the fuck do you think
you’re doing here

MOLLY
Nothing I was just asking for--

CRYSTAL
Asking for a beat-down ‘Cause when
you start giving bedroom eyes to
Bobby that’s when the future Mrs
Bobby starts getting very angry

INT TATTOO PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

As Steve keeps talking on the phone with Tommy Taglioni
Richie notices the commotion happening outside

RICHIE
Oh shit I’1l1 be right back

EXT TATTOO PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

Crystal pops open her trunk and pulls out a baseball bat She
slaps it against her hand a few times Molly looks terrified

CRYSTAL
Welcome to the Jersey Shore bitch

Just before Crystal can swing at Molly Richie rushes out of
the tattoo parlor and grabs the bat from Crystal

RICHIE
Whoa whoa whoa What the hell is
wrong with you Crystal

Crystal quickly composes herself and acts innocent and sweet

CRYSTAL
Richie I was merely driving by on
my way to the tanning salon and I
happened to notice this
individual talking to the man I
love So I was obviously curious to
know what they were talking about

MOLLY
I just wanted directions

CRYSTAL
You wanted to get your pussy ate

Crystal charges Molly but Richie holds her back

RICHIE
Okay settle down Crystal get a
hold of yourself Look it’s a
beautiful day Sun is shining Warm
breeze No reason to act like this
You got a problem call Bobby and
sort it out with him This nice
girl clearly means no harm

CRYSTAL
(composing herself again)
Youre right Richie You’re right

Crystal gets back into her car She calls Bobby on her phone

CRYSTAL (CONTD)
(into her phone)
Hi baby Where are you What do

Crystal SCREECHES off down the street Richie turns to Molly

RICHIE
You okay

MOLLY
Jesus that was insane

RICHIE
Yeah Crystal’s got some serious
mental problems Just take a couple
deep breaths you’ll be all right

Molly calms herself down For the first time Richie takes in
her attire the khaki shorts the leather sandals Slightly
intrigued he doesn’t quite know what to make of her

RICHIE (CONT’D)
So you need directions

MOLLY
Yeah I’m trying to get to the bird
sanctuary

RICHIE
Is that the new titty bar on Ocean
Street

MOLLY
No it’s a sanctuary for birds

From the quizzical look on Richie’s face it’s clear to Molly
that he doesn’t understand what she’s talking about

MOLLY (CONTD)
It’s a bunch of acres of protected
marshland It’s filled with birds

RICHIE
Hold up a minute Are you fuckin’
with me That’s here in Jersey

MOLLY
Yeah there are hundreds of rare
species that come here to breed

Molly looks Richie over Now she seems to be taking in his
appearance the spiked hair the tan the tight jeans As
with Richie she doesn’t quite know what to make of him

MOLLY (CONTD)
Anyway thanks for helping me You
pretty much saved my life
RICHIE
No problem Good luck finding the
uh what’s it called again
MOLLY
The New Jersey State Bird
Sanctuary
RICHIE

Molly walks away Richie watches her go perplexed and
slightly captivated by her After she disappears around the
corner Steve bursts out of the tattoo parlor

STEVE
Boom Problem solved Tommy
Taglioni’s getting us tickets He’s
number 23 in line right now

RICHIE
(still distracted)
That’s That’s great

STEVE
Of course it’s great You should be

Richie snaps out of it and gives Steve a high-five

RICHIE
Youre right sorry This is the
best news ever Steve Jovi’s last
show Are you fuckin’ kidding me

STEVE
We’re going out big tonight This
is a fuckin’ celebration

INT CLUB CHAMPAGNE BUBBLES - NIGHT

There is a huge dance floor with strobe lights and a big
machine blowing out clouds of bubbles Everyone is grinding
and groping each other All the guys are wearing silk shirts
and Kangol hats and all the girls are wearing skirts that
are so short you can see their asses sticking out the bottom

Richie Steve and Big Night Out strut into the club like they
own the place pointing and waving to everybody This is
their stomping ground They saunter up to the bar where Bobby
is hanging out Aside from the black eye and the laceration
he now has a BANDAGED EAR Richie slaps five with him

RICHIE
Oh DJ Scratchocalypse in the
house

STEVE

(to the bartender)
Four ‘buca bombs And make them
big More like ‘buca Hiroshimas
This is a special occasion

BIG NIGHT OUT
Fuckin’ Jovi baby

The four of them form a huge rowdy group hug A young hot
chick walks past them grabbing Steve’s attention

STEVE
Whoa Check that the fuck out

BIG NIGHT OUT
Yeah she’s kinda hot But I
guarantee once you get her clothes
off her vagina’s probably totally
pink And like wheres the droop

Bobby shakes his head in disgust The bartender slides them
each a Sambuca shot a beer and a Redbull The four of them
raise their shots for a toast

STEVE
To summertime To the annihilation
of pubes and body hair And most
importantly to old friends

They all drop their shots into their beers and chug
LATER THAT NIGHT

Bobby is up in the DJ booth Crystal is next to him scoping
out female threats like a bodyguard Bobby is spinning and
scratching on the turntables as a thumping sex-infused house
remix of Bon Jovi’s Wanted Dead or Alive plays

ANGLE ON Big Night Out dancing while holding his shirt tail
up in his mouth so that his glistening abs are exposed

ANGLE ON Steve grotesquely grinding the ass of one chick
who’s making out with another chick

ANGLE ON Richie standing off to the side by himself He nods
along to the music but he’s not as into it as everyone else

EVEN LATER THAT NIGHT

As Bobby continues to spin the vocals from Bon Jovi’s Always
play over a club style RandB background Everyone is drunk and

slow-dancing on the dance floor A JERSEY MUSCLEHEAD wearing

wrap-around sunglasses approaches the DJ booth

JERSEY MUSCLEHEAD
Yo Scatchocalypse Can you play
something else besides Bon Jovi
It’s 2009 Let’s get some modern
club jams up in here Young Jeezy
Rihanna Maybe some Lady Gaga

BOBBY
“Lady Gaga” Hey guy I don’t know
if you heard but Jovi’s retiring
That’s right New Jersey’s state
treasure So go back out onto the
dance floor and savor this shit
‘cause it ain’t gonna last forever

Bobby scratches the turntables and segues into a bumping
bass heavy remix of Bon Jovi’s You Give Love a Bad Name
Everyone in the club CHEERS

ANGLE ON Steve and Richie at the bar They notice a group of
COLLEGE KIDS coming into the bar They wear NYU and RUTGERS T-
shirts with khaki Banana Republic shorts

STEVE
Here comes the shit of the Earth
The only thing I hate about
summertime Stone Harbor kids

Richie curiously eyes the group almost jealously

STEVE (CONTD)
Their rich parents rent houses in
Stone Harbor for the summer and
they act like they own the fuckin’
boardwalk Listening to their puss
rock Hitting the beach with SPF
50 Not cutting the sleeves off
their T-shirts

The college kids go up to the bar right next to Richie and
Steve One of them gets the bartender’s attention

COLLEGE KID 1
You got any microbrews on tap bro

COLLEGE KID 2
Hey Marcus order me a Ketel One
and cran

Steve shudders disgusted The college kids notice Richie and
chuckle at the sight of him whispering under their breaths

COLLEGE KID 2 (CONT’D)
Dude check out that bro’s hair

COLLEGE KID 3
Oh my god Just imagine the
conversations on his Facebook wall

Richie looks embarrassed Steve gets up in their faces
STEVE
Hey what the fuck did you just say

about my friend

COLLEGE KID 2
What Nothing bro Chillax

RICHIE
Steve it doesn’t matter Just let
it go

STEVE

Hey nobody talks shit about my
friend This kid is definitely
getting fart mouthed

COLLEGE KID 2
(chuckling)
“Fart mouthed” Did you just say
“fart mouthed”

STEVE
Yeah That’s what I said

COLLEGE KID 2
Hey Fenster I’m apparently about
to get “fart mouthed”

Their group laughs Suddenly Steve wrestles the college kid
to the ground so that they’re practically in a 69 position

COLLEGE KID 2 (CONT’D)
Dude what are you doing This is
not cool Dude

Steve locks the college kid’s head between his legs and FARTS
directly into his mouth The college kid GAGS

COLLEGE KID 2 (CONT’D)
Oh god There’s a fart inside my
mouth

GERALD

GERALD
So I open the Exit 36 location
right across the street from our
biggest competitor PetSmart A
month later I see the PetSmart
manager at a bar drinking himself
into oblivion contemplating
suicide because what is he gonna
do fight Godzilla with a stick

Chris Noodler and Fogelman burst out with affected laughter
Gerald flips a steak basking in their reverence

CHRIS
That’s for sure
GERALD
There you go Chris you cut me off
again Can I finish what I was
saying Is that all right with you

CHRIS
Of course I’m sorry Gerald

We return to Molly Nan and Chloe drinking their wine

NAN
And how lovely is it that Chris’

Noodler seems like a real catch

MOLLY
Noodler

NAN
Sure he’s got a silly nickname
But he told me he’s getting his
real estate license this year

MOLLY
I don’t think Noodler’s my type

CHLOE
Not your type You should be happy
if Noodler even looks at you
Noodler was captain of the baseball
team At Rutgers

Molly rolls her eyes suppressing her annoyance with Chloe

NAN
Well it seems to me no one is ever
your type Molly Otherwise why
would you be sitting here without a
boyfriend at 25-years-old playing
with a filthy feather What is
that Why are you doing that

MOLLY
It’s just a tail feather from a
pied-billed grebe I found it at
the bird sanctuary today

NAN
The bird sanctuary I thought you
were going to the beach to get some
color You’re so pale

Gerald enters through the screen door with a tray of steaks

NAN (CONTD)
Okay you know how I’m really good
with funny rhymes Molly Well I
just came up with a new one about
your paleness “You can’t find a
man if your tan isn’t” Wait I

slips the feather into her pocket so Gerald can’t see it

EXT JERSEY SHORE BEACH - NIGHT

It’s almost dawn Richie Steve Big Night Out and Bobby are
sitting on the beach still wasted They have just come from
a fast food stand and are eating macaroni balls which are
little fried balls filled with macaroni and cheese

BIG NIGHT OUT
Man I can’t believe Jovi’s
retiring It’s like the end of a
really good fuckin’ band

BOBBY
Jovi was the greatest poet of our
time “On a steel horse I ride”
It’s like what the fuck does that
even mean

STEVE
I’1l tell you exactly what it
means There’s this guy and he’s
on a motorcycle and he’s speeding
down the Jersey Turnpike And he’s
trying to get away from the cops
‘cause cops are fuckin’ jerkoffs

Big Night Out interrupts loudly clearing his throat

BIG NIGHT OUT
A motorcycle That’s not what
Jovis saying at all You ever
banged a chick who had like
beautiful silverish whitish pubic
hair It’s like the mane that would
be on a steel horse And since it’s
a pussy you gotta ride it see
“On a steel horse I ride” That’s
what Jovi’s talking about

BOBBY
Youre fuckin’ sick you know that

STEVE
What about you Richie What do you
think Jovi’s saying

Richie looks introspective as he considers this

RICHIE
I guess if you think of a horse it
represents like freedom and not
being tied down to anything And if
you think of steel it’s like a
horse that could break through any
fence and just do whatever it
wants It’s like Jovi’s saying we
gotta like ride our hopes and
dreams and never get fenced in

There is an uncomfortable beat None of the other guys seems
to understand what Richie’s talking about Steve laughs
breaking the silence He playfully puts Richie in a headlock

STEVE
Come here you fuckin’ weirdo

INT RICHIE’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Richie walks into the house still wearing his clothes from
the night before He sits down at the kitchen table and sighs
to himself He looks a little lonely and dejected

Richie’s dad Ron enters the kitchen

RON
Hey look who’s home Fun night

RICHIE
It was okay

Ron tosses a well worn book onto the kitchen table Jack
Kerouac’s On the Road

RON
I found this on the back of the
shitter yesterday Is it yours

RICHIE
(embarrassed)
Oh Maybe yeah I think I was
taking an extra long deuce just
needed some reading material

RON
Well careful with that thing
You’1ll fuck up your eyes All the
tiny little words

Ron pours out a couple cups of coffee

RON (CONT’D)
So what are you up to today Gonna
hit the boardwalk Eat some funnel
cakes chase some ass

RICHIE
Yeah maybe Hey do you know where
the bird sanctuary is

RON
Whoa ho ho The bird place Hey
say no more Before I met your
mother the bird place used to be
my secret fuck spot I bet there’s
still about 40 of my used rubbers
floating around those marshlands

Ron brings a tray of two cups of coffee and two shot glasses
of Jagermeister over to the table and sits down with Richie

RICHIE
So you know where it is

RON
Yeah sure I’ll tell you But
finish up your breakfast first

Ron raises his shot glass Richie reluctantly follows suit
They both drop their shots of Jagermeister into their
coffees Richie unenthusiastically sips his cup while Ron
pounds his scalding hot coffee like it’s a Jager bomb When
Ron is finished he looks like he’s in pure agony

RON (CONTD)
Fuck that coffee’s hot Fuckin’
burns

EXT RICHIE’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - MORNING

Richie gets into his beat-up Camaro parked in the driveway
He tries to start it a few times The engine finally catches
and revs up in a CACOPHONY of unhealthy sounds and small
explosions This car is clearly on its last mile

EXT NEW JERSEY STATE BIRD SANCTUARY - ENTRANCE - DAY

A dirt road runs past a sign that reads “WELCOME TO THE NEW
JERSEY STATE BIRD SANCTUARY” The serene quietude is suddenly
broken by Richie’s noisy car as it SPUTTERS down the road

EXT NEW JERSEY STATE BIRD SANCTUARY - DAY

This is a beautiful sprawl of protected wilderness full of
streams ponds and meadows There are hundreds of different
bird species nesting among the vegetation Richie is walking
along a path consulting a brochure He strains his eyes to
make out a red-throated loon He is blown away by the sight

RICHIE
Holy fuck

Later Richie sees a scarlet tanager He looks fascinated
RICHIE (CONTD)
Damn That thing is tripped the

fuck out

Later Richie spots a harlequin duck Once again he has an
expression of wonder on his face

RICHIE (CONTD)
Total fuckin’ brain fuck

ANGLE ON A well dressed MOM and 2 kids standing next to him

MOM
Could you watch your language
please

RICHIE

Oh I’m sorry Miss It’s just
these birds are f’n nuts

EXT NEW JERSEY STATE BIRD SANCTUARY - PARKING LOT - DAY

Richie walks out to the parking lot looking inspired He
unlocks his car and spots someone a few cars over

It’s Molly She is sitting awkwardly on the hood of her
Saturn sedan facing the sun with her eyes closed She has
her shorts scrunched up to her crotch and the sleeves of her
shirt rolled up to her shoulders Richie hesitantly walks up

RICHIE
Excuse me Hey I know you right

Molly opens her eyes and looks at him Embarrassed she
quickly pulls the legs of her shorts down over her thighs

RICHIE (CONT’D)
Yeah aren’t you that girl Crystal
tried to beat up outside Inky’s

MOLLY
Yeah Hey how’s it going Thanks
again for saving my life

RICHIE
Don’t mention it Baseball bats
hurt

There is a beat of silence Neither knows what to say

RICHIE (CONTD)
Anyway after you told me about
this place I thought I’d check it
out Some bad-ass birds in there

MOLLY
Totally It’s like a rainbow of
plumages

RICHIE

Snowy egret Fuckin’ fuck

MOLLY
You saw a snowy egret

RICHIE
Isn’t that the duck with the
tripped out paint job

MOLLY
I think what you saw was a
harlequin duck Still a great
sighting though

RICHIE
Right right the harlequin duck
That’s the one that migrates east
and west instead of north and south
like normal birds

MOLLY
Yeah How’d you know about that
RICHIE
I think I saw it on the Discovery
Channel
(embarrassed)

(MORE)

RICHIE (CONTD)
I mean I was just flipping through
channels or some shit

MOLLY

I love the Discovery Channel
RICHIE

You do
MOLLY

Their documentaries are amazing
RICHIE

It’s pretty cool right
MOLLY

Totally
RICHIE

I saw this show the other day where
they recreate Leonardo da Vincis
inventions The fuckin’ brain on
that guy Nuts And then last week
there was this thing about vampire
squids

MOLLY
I saw that yeah They can turn
themselves on and off like light
bulbs

RICHIE
I know And it’s fuckin’ real

Molly nods She seems surprised and intrigued by Richie’s
unlikely knowledge and curiosity Suddenly her WATCH ALARM
starts beeping She tries to turn it off

RICHIE (CONT’D)
Oh sorry You gotta go somewhere

MOLLY
No I was just timing my uh My
mom thinks I’m at the beach right
now She’s obsessed with me getting
a tan so I was forcing myself to
sit in the sun for 20 minutes

RICHIE
Hey if you want any tips on
tanning it’s one of my
specialties Last summer I did
this combo of natural and spray-on
By August fuckin’ Tarzan glow

MOLLY
For some reason I can’t get into
tanning The sun is just so hot

RICHIE
Well it’s not about the tanning I
mean tanning’s cool but it’s more
about enjoying your surroundings
You ever been to Beer Can Beach

Molly shakes her head

RICHIE (CONTD)
It’s actually pretty nice Very
little broken glass They even got
a hot pretzel stand If you want I
could like show it to you show
you my tanning techniques Your mom
would probably like that right

MOLLY
I don’t know I’m supposed to be
back in Stone Harbor by 3 to go
with my sister to the florist

RICHIE
Stone Harbor

MOLLY
Were staying there for the summer

Richie takes in this new information It’s as though Molly
has suddenly become unobtainable to him

RICHIE
All right that’s okay Forget
about it I’1l see you around

Richie starts to leave Molly hesitantly calls out to him

MOLLY
Although you did save me from
that insane girl with the baseball
bat And I do love hot pretzels

RICHIE
Yeah me too And you know what a
lot of people don’t know Hot
pretzels aren’t even pretzels It’s
more like bread with salt on it

MOLLY
Youre right I never really
thought of it like that

Richie holds out his hand

RICHIE
I’m Richie by the way

MOLLY
(shaking his hand)
I’m Molly

RICHIE
Nice to meet you Molly

EXT BEACH BARGAIN RECORDS - DAY

A long line of Bon Jovi fans waiting for tickets wraps around
the block A rusted out Ford Festiva drives up with Steve at

the wheel He HONKS his horn a couple times and cockily yells
out to the people at the end of the line

STEVE
Look how far back you are in line
Good luck getting tickets you
fuckin’ dipshits

Steve cruises up the street He scans the faces at the front
of the line unable to find whom he’s looking for

STEVE (CONTD)
What the fuck

Steve recognizes BUMPS a 12-year-old kid who clearly got his
nickname because of his really bad acne Steve pulls over and
talks to him through his open window

STEVE (CONTD)
Hey Bumps you seen Tommy
Taglioni

BUMPS
Tommy You didn’t hear Tommy had
to go to the hospital

STEVE
The hospital What I paid him to
wait in line for me

BUMPS

Tommy’s dad had a heart attack last
night The doctors say it’s really
bad He lost oxygen to his brain
for 3 minutes and now he can’t
even move the left side of his--

STEVE
Blah blah blah Jovi tickets
Who’s buying them You

BUMPS
I wish I could help you out But
Billy Murders already paid me to
get tickets for him and all his
cousins Eight ticket max

STEVE
So you’re not gonna Jovi me

BUMPS
Sorry Steve

Steve clenches his fists and breathes deeply

STEVE
There is a rage building inside me
It’s like some volcanic type shit
And it’s taking a fuckload of self-
control to keep myself from
punching your dick

EXT JERSEY SHORE BEACH - DAY

Richie and Molly are strolling along the beach together
eating hot pretzels

MOLLY
And I could see this robin’s nest
right outside my bedroom window I
saw the eggs get laid I saw the
hatchlings come out and then I
watched them grow up and fly away
But something about the birds
always stayed with me They’re just
so free They can go anywhere

RICHIE
That’s amazing All I had outside
my window growing up was a turd

MOLLY
A turd

RICHIE
(self-conscious)
Uh never mind Forget it

MOLLY
Well now you have to tell me

RICHIE
When we were little my friend
Steve he tossed one of his turds
up in the branches as a joke and
it just stayed there for years and
years Eventually it turned white
I used to look at it every day when
I was getting dressed and be like
that’s gotta be some kind of
record 7 or 8 years of a turd
sitting on a branch Damn

Molly chuckles

MOLLY
It turned white That’s so weird

RICHIE
I know right I think it might
actually still be up there

MOLLY
No way

Richie laughs with Molly

MOLLY (CONT’D)
So you grew up here

RICHIE
My whole life I’ve known my
friends since I was in diapers We
spend almost every day together

MOLLY
That must be nice

RICHIE
It’s nice But sometimes it feels a
little like like I’m stuck here
Like nothing ever really changes

MOLLY
I think I know what you mean My
family can be pretty
claustrophobic What I really
wanted to do this summer was go on
a roadtrip up north to Canada

RICHIE
A roadtrip That sounds awesome
Like On the Road You ever read
that It’s a book

MOLLY
Yeah definitely I read it in high
school It made me realize how big
America really is

RICHIE
Totally We got Atlantic City We
got Florida We got like
farmlands mountains fuckin’
Vegas Shit is huge

MOLLY
Yeah but here I am stuck with my
family in Stone Harbor for the
whole summer

RICHIE
If you wanna get out of the house
I could show you some other cool
places What are you up to next
Friday night

MOLLY
Nothing

RICHIE
There’s this new fish place that
just opened on the Shore Not just
fish sandwiches neither All kinds
of fancy sauces and other like
vegetables and shit next to the
fish We could check that out

MOLLY
That sounds fun

Up ahead Richie sees a group of Jersey muscleheads drinking
beers and tanning on the beach Not wanting to run into them
with Molly he stops and gestures toward the sand

RICHIE
If you’re tired from walking we
can sit

Richie and Molly sit down and stare out at the ocean
MOLLY

Thanks for taking me here Richie
You were right it’s beautiful

RICHIE
You know when I look out at the
ocean at first I think about all
the immigrants and Al Qaeda fuckers
out there on their little rafts
coming this way and it makes me
wanna puke But then I see how
pretty the ocean is and I wonder
what lies beyond it And then I
like don’t wanna puke

MOLLY
Yeah it’s funny First impressions
never seem to be right do they

Molly and Richie share a tender smile

INT SKEE-BALL ZONE - DAY

This is a typically trashy Jersey Shore arcade There is an
overwhelming cacophony of digital beeps and zaps Steve
strolls around the arcade From the looks of his ill fitting
uniform it’s obvious that he’s the security guard He yells
to a shirtless chubby 10-year-old KID playing Rampage

STEVE
Hey kid put a shirt on

CHUBBY KID
The sign doesn’t say I have to

STEVE
Look at your tits You really want
people to see that Push-ups Ever
heard of them

The chubby kid gives Steve the finger Steve flips him off
right back

ANGLE ON By the entrance Big Night Out and Bobby are side-
by-side playing skee-ball Richie walks in all smiles

BIG NIGHT OUT
Hey Richie What’s up with the gay-
ass grin

RICHIE
Nothing Just had a pleasant
morning Suck my fuckin’ pipe

Steve sees Richie and waves him over Richie approaches him

STEVE
Where the fuck you been

RICHIE
Why What’s the problem

STEVE
What’s the problem Little Tommy
Taglioni fucked me on the Jovi
tickets Apparently his heart-
attack-ass dad’s idea of fitness is
doing fuckin’ milkshake curls

Steve mimics lifting a milkshake to his mouth

RICHIE
It’s okay We’1ll just do what we
always do Meadowlands parking lot
I mean does it matter that much

STEVE
Of course it does This is our last
chance to finally see Jovi

RICHIE
Hey Steve did you know there’s a
bird sanctuary on the Shore

STEVE
What the fuck does that have to do
with Jovi

RICHIE
I’m just saying I went there this
morning and it was actually kinda
cool You should check it out

STEVE
What you went there alone

RICHIE
Yeah Anyway it’s like acres of
land where birds are like flying
around and hanging out and singing
their songs probably fucking each
other laying eggs all that shit

STEVE
Richie if you wanna punch birds
there’s plenty of birds right here
on the boardwalk

RICHIE
No but there it’s all different
kinds of birds It’s like It’s

like a rainbow of feathers

STEVE
A rainbow of feathers Are you on
fuckin’ acid Birds are those white
things that squawk and try to steal
your macaroni balls Not to
mention they take shits all over
our beloved boardwalk Birds are
disgusting That’s why it’s so
satisfying to see them get punched

RICHIE
I think you’re just talking about
seagulls Steve

STEVE
Bird seagull what’s the
difference

Richie looks frustrated by Steve’s lack of understanding and
appreciation Steve suddenly notices something across the
arcade He gets an irate look on his face

STEVE (CONTD)
Hold on a sec

Steve marches over to the Whac-a-Mole machine where an
adorable little girl is trying to hit the moles with a padded
mallet He leans over and stares her right in the face

STEVE (CONTD)
Listen What did I tell you about
whacking the mole too hard with the
mallet It fucks up the mallet You
understand me you fuck

INT STONE HARBOR SUMMER HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Gerald is sitting on the couch with Nan Chloe is pacing back
and forth in front of Chris Noodler and Fogelman

CHLOE
I don’t want red roses Red roses

skanky girlfriends I want white
roses Just because we’re at the
Jersey Shore does not mean my

father did was roll over and show
me the receipt for all the food he
bought Trust me there will be
more than enough The receipt
itself was a good foot and a half
long

Gerald pulls the receipt out of his pocket and holds it up
like a prize fish allowing it to unfurl

GERALD
I’m surprised the cash register
didn’t run out of ink

INT USA PIZZA - DAY
Richie and Dom are making pizzas together Dom belts out the

Italian standard Core ngrato It sounds like the kind of
sentimental operatic song an old Italian man would sing

A DELIVERY GUY walks into the shop with a package of produce

DELIVERY GUY
I got some produce here for Dominic
Vincenzo Spatafore

DOM
Yeah that’s me

DELIVERY GUY
You’re Dominic Vincenzo Spatafore

DOM
The one and only

The delivery guy looks at Dom skeptically He glances at
Richie and chuckles Richie shrugs

DELIVERY GUY
Seriously though I need Mr
Spatafore to sign for this

DOM
Hey Gimme the fuckin’ package and
get the fuck outta here

Dom raises his fist and grabs the package The delivery guy
nervously hurries out of the store Dom yells after him

DOM (CONTD)
Fammi un bocchino

(to Richie)
Can you believe this fanuk

Dom shakes his head and returns to making pizzas with Richie

RICHIE

Hey Dom can I ask you a question
DOM

Yeah sure
RICHIE

Do you ever feel like like you
don’t really fit in Like you’re
supposed to be one thing but maybe
it turns out you’re really
something else underneath

DOM
Fuck no

Dom raises his hand for a high-5 Richie awkwardly slaps it

DOM (CONTD)

By the way thanks for noticing my

new tattoo asshole Took Inky over
four hours to do it Check it out

Dom flexes his arm and points to his bicep All we can see is
his really dark skin Is there even a tattoo there

RICHIE
Wait is it on the other arm

DOM
It’s right there Richie It’s the
Sicilian flag

Richie can’t help but give Dom a confused look

EXT JERSEY SHORE BOARDWALK - NIGHT

Richie is standing outside of a not quite upscale seafood
restaurant called “THE LOBSTER HOUSE” He is wearing a button-
down shirt and an ugly tie spotted with the New York Giants
team logo He is holding a single red rose He looks nervous

Suddenly a PURPLE VAN with a Playboy-Bunny-shaped window in
the back speeds up onto the curb and SCREECHES to a halt Big
Night Out is driving He and Steve get out Big Night Out has
his arm around DORIS a gross 65-year-old with dyed blonde
hair and sun damaged skin Steve playfully punches Richie

STEVE
Look at this fuckin’ guy We’ve
been looking all over for you

BIG NIGHT OUT
Richie I’d like you to meet the
new apple of my eye Doris turn
around and show us what you got

Doris turns around doing a sultry dance As she does this we
see her wrinkled saggy ass sticking out of the bottom of a
way too short Catholic schoolgirl skirt

STEVE
So you ready to hit up Club Sweat
DJ Scratchocalypse goes on at 10
remember

RICHIE
Oh yeah I forgot about that

STEVE
Hey what’s with the tie Donald
fuckin’ Trump over here

Richie glances around anxious about Molly showing up

RICHIE

somebody tonight Maybe I could
catch up with you guys later on

BIG NIGHT OUT
Whoa Must be a pretty nice dick
garage if you brought her a rose I

call her She was crazy perfumey

RICHIE
Listen you guys should probably
get going I wouldn’t want you to
get a ticket parked here like that

BIG NIGHT OUT
Don’t worry Richie If the boys in
blue roll up Doris will distract
them Do your special trick Doris

Doris lifts up her tube-top to reveal the worst set of tits
we have ever seen She lowers her top and coughs like someone
who’s been smoking for 50 years She spits onto the ground

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
Put your eyeballs back in your
heads fellas She’s taken

Suddenly Molly walks up to Richie wearing a cardigan
sweater over a sundress

MOLLY
Richie hi Sorry Im late

STEVE
Who’s this

RICHIE

Richie seems uncomfortable There is an awkward moment as
Steve and Big Night Out size Molly up
RICHIE (CONTD)

MOLLY
Oh right It’s nice to meet you

BIG NIGHT OUT

MOLLY
Molly

BIG NIGHT OUT
Molly let me ask you a question
Do you like music

MOLLY
Uh sure

BIG NIGHT OUT
Then do you think you might enjoy
the combination of classic Jersey
rock lyrics set to the sensuous
sexual beat of contemporary
clubtronic ecstasy

MOLLY
I guess that could be interesting

RICHIE
Guys I really don’t--

BIG NIGHT OUT
Then that settles it
(pointing to his van)
Everyone in the Fuchsia Fuck
Machine

INT CLUB SWEAT - NIGHT

The club is packed with Jersey trash Big haired skanks are
grinding up against orange faced tight bead-necklace wearing
muscleheads Bobby is up in the DJ booth controlling the
turntables as a thumping techno remix of Bon Jovi’s Blaze of
Glory shakes the walls of the club

Richie Molly Steve and Big Night Out are sitting on bar
stools around a table They are all holding up some kind of
“bomb” shot drink for a toast Richie seems a bit on edge

STEVE
To fighting and fucking
RICHIE
Hey come on
STEVE
What
RICHIE

There’s a lady present

MOLLY
It’s fine Richie

STEVE
Look you Stone Harbor types may
not approve or whatever but when I
go out clubbing I either fight or
fuck On a good night I fight and
fuck But mostly I just fight

MOLLY
That sounds adventurous

STEVE
Fuckin’ is

Steve pounds his chest with his fist a couple times

STEVE (CONTD)
So as I was saying to my two
favorite things fighting and
fucking

BIG NIGHT OUT
Here here

They all drop their shots into their glasses and drink them

RICHIE
(to Molly)
You okay It’s not too smoky in
here for you

MOLLY
Not at all

RICHIE
The music’s not too loud

MOLLY
I’m fine Richie I’m having fun

BIG NIGHT OUT
How could DJ Scratchocalypse ever
be too loud Jovi set to house
music Explode my fuckin’ eardrums
with that shit as far as I’m
concerned

STEVE
So wait explain to me again how
you two met ‘Cause I don’t get it

RICHIE
We met on the street randomly

MOLLY
But then we really met at the bird
sanctuary Richie thought he saw a
snowy egret

STEVE
A snowy what

RICHIE
Nothing We were just hanging out
in the parking lot and then we--
(remembering something)
Oh you know what Molly I looked
it up and it wasn’t a harlequin
duck It was an American widgeon

MOLLY
You thought an American widgeon was
a snowy egret

RICHIE
I know I’m fuckin’ retarded

Molly and Richie share a chuckle Steve stares at the two of
them with confusion and disgust

STEVE
(to himself)
What the fuck

Their chuckling dies down Steve clears his throat

STEVE (CONTD)
Hey speaking of acting retarded
Richie remember when you pissed on
that 6-year-old girl from my
cousin’s balcony Fuckin’ classic

RICHIE
Come on it didn’t happen like
that You’re exaggerating

STEVE
What are you talking about Her
head was covered in piss foam

RICHIE
I don’t remember that

STEVE
Yeah you don’t remember ‘cause you
were shitfaced on Zima

MOLLY
Uh Big Night Out

BIG NIGHT OUT
What can I do for you sweetie

MOLLY
I hate to be the one to say it but
it looks like your date Doris has
made some new friends

ANGLE ON Doris is dancing with two fat meatheads Her
“dancing” entails one guy slamming into her ass with his
crotch while another guy grinds her face into his boner

BIG NIGHT OUT
Eh forget about her I go home
with a different chick almost every
night See that 60-year-old prom
queen strutting her stuff outside
the handicapped bathroom door

ANGLE ON A haggard 67-year-old woman with a bad limp She
is obviously waiting to use the handicapped restroom

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
I fuckin’ deep knuckled that shit
two nights ago on the dance floor
And see that cougar in the sequin
dress kicking it at the bar

ANGLE ON A gross 70-year-old woman at the bar drinking
alone She drops a Jager shot into a Bud Lite and chugs it

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
Took her home last weekend Fuckin’
rocked my world Not only was she
wearing Lovely the fragrance from
Sarah Jessica Parker but her tits
were like two gym socks And she
had the loosest ass

Richie looks horribly embarrassed Molly seems a little
disturbed but she musters a smile for Richie’s benefit

STEVE
Big Night Out you do realize a
cougar is a hot older woman who
fucks a young man

BIG NIGHT OUT
Exactly

Steve suddenly spots someone across the dance floor sitting
at the bar He gets an angry look on his face

STEVE
No fuckin’ way

Steve marches up to the bar and stands behind the person

STEVE (CONTD)
Tommy Taglioni

The person spins around to reveal that he is a cocky 13-year-
old kid in a wife beater and a gold chain This is TOMMY
TAGLIONI He is about to do a Jager bomb at the bar with two
other 13-year-old kids

TOMMY TAGLIONI
Steve what’s up

STEVE
What the fuck are you doing here
You’re 13-years-old

TOMMY TAGLIONI
That’s not what my fuckin’ ID says

Tommy Taglioni’s friends laugh

STEVE
I thought your dad had a heart
attack

TOMMY TAGLIONI
He did

(holds up his shot)
I’m fuckin’ grieving over here

STEVE
Yeah well you boned me on those
Jovi tickets Tommy

TOMMY TAGLIONI
Cry me a fuckin’ river
(to his friends)
Fuckin’ balls on this guy

Tommy Taglioni’s friends laugh again Steve’s face morphs
into a visage of pure rage

ANGLE ON Richie Molly and Big Night Out observing Steve

MOLLY
Does Steve know that kid

BIG NIGHT OUT
Yeah he used to babysit for him

At the bar Steve suddenly PUNCHES Tommy Taglioni in the
face One of Tommy Taglioni’s friends jumps onto Steve’s
shoulders and starts choking him from behind The other 13-
year-old kid PUNCHES Steve in the balls

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
Oh here we go

Big Night Out grabs a beer bottle holds it upside down and
marches toward the fight Molly looks stunned Richie hangs
his head in shame

a group of 13-year-old kids

MOLLY

friends won that fight

RICHIE
Well if I were you I wouldn’t
wanna hang around a crew like that
Youre like all classy and shit

Molly can’t help but blush

MOLLY
So your friends were a little out
of control But honestly I liked

INT STEVE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

This apartment is a mess There are dozens of empty beer cans
everywhere The couch has rips in it and the plaster on the
walls is falling off There are a bunch of Bon Jovi posters
and a weight bench in the middle of the living room

Steve Big Night Out and Bobby are sitting around listening
to Bon Jovis Never Say Goodbye on the radio Big Night Out
is regaling Steve and Bobby with a story

BIG NIGHT OUT
Summer 1987 It was just like
this radio call-in contest My
buddy Johnny Sausage gets a bruise
on the tip of his finger from
punching the redial button so many
times But it all pays off ‘cause
he gets on the air and wins 4 front
row tickets to the Slippery When
Wet Summer Tour grand finale at the
Meadowlands We get there 3 hours
early We’re so pumped Opening
band takes the stage They fuckin’
suck

(MORE)

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
So obviously for the whole set I’m
sitting there fake yawning holding
my middle finger up in their faces
They finally finish their shit set
but Jovi’s a good half hour late
People are starting to wonder what
the fuck Suddenly the arena goes
black

Steve and Bobby lean forward on the edges of their seats
Even though they’ve probably heard Big Night Out’s story a
million times they still savor every word of it

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
Through the blackness we hear the
opening chords of Let It Rock
Lights come up crowd goes insane
and there’s Jovi 10 feet away from
my fuckin’ eyes I kid you not
Snakeskin boots jeans with perfect
rips at the knees gorgeous white
leather jacket with 8 inch frills
up and down the sleeves

STEVE
Oh fuck

BIG NIGHT OUT
Sambora’s hair is teased to
perfection It looks like a fuckin’
priceless sculpture sitting there
on top of his head Then I see Tico
Torres at the back of the stage
behind his kit Guy’s a fuckin’
machine His sticks are moving with
such speed and precision that they
actually start to glow They’re
about to fuckin’ burst into flames

BOBBY
Shit

BIG NIGHT OUT
But none of that matters ‘Cause
what happened next changed me for
life I’m staring at Jovi right
And something feels weird
Something crazy’s going on So I
look down at Jovi’s snakeskin
boots and they are literally 6
inches off the ground The guy is
just floating there Fuckin’

levitating
(MORE)

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
Next thing I know a drop of sweat
flies off Jovi’s wrist and lands on
a crippled kid’s forehead After
the show when we’re all leaving I
look at the kid He’s still
definitely crippled but he’s
like way less limpy Fuckin’
miracle

Steve and Bobby lie back on the couch absorbing the glorious
mythology of Jon Bon Jovi

BOBBY
Damn

STEVE
We gotta get those fuckin’ tickets
I will not have peace in my heart
until we’re inside the Meadowlands
and I look upon real-life Jovi with
my own two eyes

BOBBY
Like I said Steve there’s always
Anne Maskowitz She’s had a crush
on you ever since you front-wedgied
her in elementary school

STEVE
Anne the Man That chick looks like
a fuckin’ man

BOBBY
Well her dad works for the
Meadowlands If you slipped her
some sauseesh I guarantee there’d
be some Jovi tickets in it for you

STEVE
Anne the Man is the most disgusting
human being on Earth She’s got
fuckin’ sideburns I will never go
out like that

The front door opens and Richie walks in

BOBBY
Oh Look who finally shows up

STEVE

supposed to be here an hour ago

RICHIE

then Molly called my cell and

Steve rolls his eyes

BIG NIGHT OUT

put seaweed down my pants and told
everyone it was my pubes and then
pulled it out and threw it in their
fuckin’ faces Hilarious

are both fogging themselves with Stallion Noir cologne

RICHIE
I just forgot to do it okay It’s

behave yourselves No fart
mouthing no ass-grab baseball no
kicking divets into the grass

look bad-ass on a flyer people are
gonna wipe their asses with it

CHLOE’S BRIDESMAID

word “scratch” with “aca” as in
Chewbacca ‘cause I’m crazy like
that and the word “lypse” as in
pussy lips “Scratch-acca-lips”
Genius right

Chloe looks disgusted Suddenly out of the corner of his

For all we know the gas probably
went down his throat

MOLLY

Not to mention when I was taking
out the garbage an hour ago some
random trashy girl pulled up ina
gross pink car and yelled the “c”
word out the window at me

years-old You can’t forbid me from
seeing someone

GERALD
End of discussion

Molly clearly wants to respond but she keeps her mouth shut
She rushes out of the room unable to stand up to her father
Gerald watches her go with a regretful look

NAN
Look I think we can all agree that
what happened to Noodler’s mouth

and extremely gross But I will
say Richie’s friend Stanley was
quite the charming young man

Turning sympathetic Steve puts his arm around Richie

STEVE (CONTD)
Hey remember when we were kids and

that Richie In all honesty I
think you were pretty harsh when
you banned him from her life

I don’t want him distracting Molly
from what’s important Nan That
kid is just so Jersey

NAN
Did you know that boy saved her
from a vicious baseball bat attack

GERALD
What are you talking about

would’ve done that for Chloe

GERALD
Id like to think so

NAN
Gerald Chris stood there watching
paralyzed with fear while someone
beefed into his best man’s mouth

Gerald thinks this over

Bobby slaps five with Richie Steve can’t help but laugh

BIG NIGHT OUT
Genius Richie

Suddenly a skanky STRIPPER CHICK with huge fake tits walks
past the line She stops and notices Richie

STRIPPER CHICK
Hey Richie Remember me

Richie can’t seem to place her The stripper chick pulls down
her bikini top to reveal one of her huge fake tits It has a
tattoo above the nipple of Bugs Bunny holding his dick
Richie now recognizes her but he’s clearly not into her

RICHIE
Oh Destiny hey How’s it going

STRIPPER CHICK
I’m working the main stage at Joe’s
Nudes tonight You should come by
Give you a fuckin’ lap dance

RICHIE
Sounds fun Ill try to make it

The stripper chick smiles and leaves The guys watch her go

STEVE
Lucky bastard You better marry
that shit Richie ‘Cause that’s
the best the Shore has to offer

Big Night Out and Bobby nod in agreement The stripper chick
turns around and notices them all watching her She vacantly
grins at Richie over her shoulder and starts flossing her ass
with her bikini thong Richie looks disgusted and depressed

RICHIE
Hey we got any plans next weekend

fueled insanity

(MORE)

BIG NIGHT OUT (CONTD)
We’re gonna kick off the night at
Club Sexorcist Then Club Sweat

RICHIE

different Like take a roadtrip

STEVE
What the fuck is a roadtrip

RICHIE
You know we all pile in a car and
drive around to like other parts
of the country and check shit out

STEVE
Why would we ever wanna leave the
Shore

BOBBY

Yeah we got everything here

STEVE

weekend Richie Drive over to
Joes Nudes and get your area

Richie gives up and becomes silent He is obviously disturbed
and frustrated by what his friends are saying
EXT PARKING LOT - MORRISTOWN NJ - DAY

Richie parks his car and gets out He looks past the other
parked cars toward what’s at the front of the lot

ANGLE ON A “PAWSMETICS PET GROOMING” center in a minimall
sandwiched in between a Rite Aid and a laundromat

INT PAWMETICS PET GROOMING - MOMENTS LATER

Richie is standing outside of an office at the back of the

Pawsmetics store He takes a deep breath and knocks The door
opens to reveal Gerald

GERALD
Richie What are you doing here

RICHIE
Sorry to show up like this Mr
Andrews I called your beach house
and your wife said you were
working I thought I’d come out
here so we could talk in private

GERALD
About what

RICHIE
Molly says she doesn’t wanna see me
anymore I figure maybe it’s got
something to do with the impression
I might have left you with

GERALD
You came all the way out here to
talk to me

Richie nods Gerald considers this He looks Richie over

INT GERALD’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

This is a cramped windowless office with off-white paint and
no decorations Gerald is sitting at his desk across from
Richie Gerald holds out his arms arrogantly

GERALD
So what do you think

RICHIE
Your office It’s really nice

GERALD
You like the chair Comfy right

RICHIE
Yeah

Gerald leans back in his chair Richie clears his throat

RICHIE (CONTD)
Mr Andrews I know my friends
aren’t exactly gentlemen But I
just want you to know that I’m not
like that I like your daughter a
lot I think we have a real
connection And who knows Maybe
she doesn’t feel the same way

(MORE )

RICHIE (CONTD)
But if she does I just hope you
can be okay with that

Gerald studies Richie for a long silent beat
GERALD

Is it true that you saved Molly
from a baseball bat attack

RICHIE
Yeah But anyone would’ve done
that

GERALD

Smart answer Richie I’ll admit I
may have tried to drive a wedge
between you two It’s just that
Molly is our oldest and smartest
daughter Her IQ is almost double
that of her younger sister This is
based on actual testing

RICHIE
She is really smart

GERALD
So then you can understand we have
extremely high hopes for her
Molly’s an ambitious girl I wanna
make sure she surrounds herself
with the right people People who
are serious about their lives

RICHIE
I understand

Gerald leans forward at his desk

GERALD
Do you wanna be making pizzas for
the rest of your life Richie Or
do you wanna be netting 87000 a
year after taxes

INT PAWSMETICS PET GROOMING - MOMENTS LATER
This is an unspectacular pet grooming center There are a few

workers blow-drying poodles and snipping cat’s nails Gerald
confidently swaggers as he leads Richie around the place

GERALD
I built this business from scratch
Look around Richie This is what
hard work can get you

Gerald takes Richie over to a dog lying on a grooming table

GERALD (CONT’D)
(sniffs the air)
You smell that It’s an herbal
fluffing formula we use We have it
imported from Italy It makes the
fur really pop

RICHIE
Smells good

GERALD
You haven’t seen the half of it
(to the dog)
Get up boy Come on

The dog stands up to reveal that it has TWO HUGE TESTICLES
dangling a good 5 inches

GERALD (CONTD)
Look at those beauties They look
totally real right

RICHIE
Yeah

GERALD
And they feel real too Check it
out Go on don’t be shy

Richie reluctantly touches the dog’s testicles

GERALD (CONT’D)
Cup them in your hand Get a real
sense of them

Richie uncomfortably cups the testicles in his hand

RICHIE
Yeah I guess yeah

GERALD
They’re called neuticals When a
male dog’s testicles are removed
it can do serious damage to the
dogs self esteem Take my pure
bred cocker spanial Ulysses
(MORE )
GERALD (CONTD)
Got him a nice pair last week He’s
never held his head higher

Gerald lets out a deep breath and raises his eyebrows

GERALD (CONT’D)
The world is moving fast Richie
If you wanna keep up if you wanna
do something amazing with your
life then you gotta be ready to
make some changes

RICHIE
I’m willing to do that

GERALD
In that case I’m willing to start
changing my opinion of you
EXT PARKING LOT - DAY

Gerald walks Richie to his car Gerald seems warmer now

GERALD

What are you doing Saturday night
RICHIE

Nothing
GERALD

My daughter’s fiancé Chris is
having a bachelor party You should
go Get to know some of those guys
Noodler and Fogelman I think youd
get along

RICHIE
They want me to come

GERALD
I’m sure they’1l be fine with it
Considering I’m paying for it
obviously 45 a head

RICHIE
Uh okay That sounds fun

GERALD
Seems to me an ambitious guy like
you could use a breath of fresh air
in the friendship department

Gerald gives Richie a pat on the back Richie doesn’t know
how to respond to what Gerald just said He politely nods

GERALD (CONTD)
Listen I appreciate you coming out
here Now go home and give Molly a
call Or if you wait till after 9
it won’t count against her minutes

EXT BOXING GYM - DAY

Steve is standing on the sidewalk outside of a place called
“GARYS BOXING GYM” He takes a nervous breath

STEVE

Steve starts jumping like a boxer warming up He punches the
sides of his head rapidly psyching himself up

INT BOXING GYM - DAY

Steve walks in and looks around until he spots what looks
like a huge buff guy pummeling a speed bag He clears his
throat to get the person’s attention

STEVE
Anne Maskowitz

ANGLE ON The person turns around to reveal that it’s ANNE
“THE MAN” MASKOWITZ a very masculine woman with sideburns a
light moustache broad shoulders and no tits She smiles a
flirtatious ugly smile at Steve

ANNE
Steve Oh my god What are you
doing here
Anne walks over to Steve and gives him a huge gross sweaty
hug Steve looks like he’s going to vomit

EXT STONE HARBOR SUMMER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Richie walks up to the house wearing a collared shirt and
nice pants He looks surprisingly clean-cut if not a little
self-conscious Gerald is sitting outside smoking a cigar

RICHIE
Hey Mr Andrews

GERALD
Here for the bachelor party huh
Chris and the guys are inside They
should be ready in a few minutes

RICHIE
Oh Okay

GERALD
Take a load off

Richie sits down Gerald proudly points to an unspectacular
used 1997 HONDA MOTORCYCLE parked in the driveway

GERALD (CONT’D)
What do you think

RICHIE
That’s yours

GERALD
Just bought it 1997 Honda Rebel
This baby is the Harley of Hondas

RICHIE
Wow that’s amazing I’ve always
wanted to ride a motorcycle
GERALD
Oh I definitely don’t plan on
riding it Richie It’s a classic
Some people collect old cars I
collect old motorcycles In fact
this beauty right here is the first
of the Andrews collection

Gerald offers Richie a cigar

RICHIE
No thanks

GERALD
You sure They’re Haitian

RICHIE
I don’t really smoke

GERALD
Smart answer

Gerald takes a few puffs off his cigar

GERALD (CONT’D)
You might find this hard to
believe Richie but you and I
actually have a lot in common

RICHIE
Really

GERALD
Does that surprise you

RICHIE
I don’t know You just seem like
so successful and like polished

GERALD
Well I wasn’t always like this
You know I grew up on the Jersey
Shore Seaside Heights

RICHIE
What No way

GERALD
Sure I used to play skee-ball at
the arcade I used to grind girls
on the dance floor I used to punch
rollerbladers for absolutely no
reason

(MORE )

GERALD (CONTD)
Hell one time I even had sex with
the mouth of a dead fish just to
make my friends laugh

RICHIE
I still don’t believe it

GERALD
You don’t believe me

Gerald turns around to make sure no one is watching from
inside the house He pulls down his pants and then pulls up
his boxer shorts as high as they’1l go

ANGLE ON A tattoo on Gerald’s inner thigh that reads “GO
NUTS” with an arrow pointing up toward his testicles One
of his balls accidentally slips out He tucks it back in

RICHIE
“Go Nuts”
(laughs)
That’s pretty funny Mr Andrews

GERALD
Of course it’s funny Probably the
funniest tattoo you’ve ever seen
Smart clever good font It’s all
those things But do you think I
show this to people anymore No
way I keep it underneath It’1ll
always be a part of me but it
doesn’t define me anymore

Richie nods taking this in

GERALD (CONT’D)
I’m sure you’ve got great friends
Richie They’re funny they’re
loyal you’ve known them your whole
life But at some point you’ve got
to make a choice It’s either you
or them Either you get out and
accomplish something with your
life or you spend the rest of your
days with macaroni ball grease
dripping down your chin

Richie and Gerald hear Noodler yelling from inside

NOODLER (0S)
Hey Fogelman You seen my Tevas
GERALD
(motioning to the house)
Now those guys inside Noodler
Fogelman Chris Total idiots But
they’re going places Richie
They’re the types of idiots you
want to surround yourself with

All I’m saying is don’t let
yourself get trapped on the Shore

It’s clear that Richie feels the disconnect between himself
and the other guys He takes a few big gulps of his mojito
and summons the courage to address the table

RICHIE (CONTD)
Hey listen I know you guys don’t
really know me so it was really
nice of you to invite me here

At the last second Richie pushes him off to the side

RICHIE

Are you fuckin’ crazy

STEVE
What’s the matter with me What the
fuck is the matter with you

RICHIE

on the Shore

STEVE
Trapped Is that how you feel

RICHIE
Sometimes yeah Maybe I wanna make
something of my life

STEVE

says “It doesn’t really matter if
we make it or not”

RICHIE
But it does Steve It does matter

STEVE
What so Jovi’s wrong

RICHIE
Maybe Jovi is wrong Maybe Jovi’s a
fuckin’ idiot

Steve looks stunned He stares incredulously at Richie

STEVE
What did you just say

RICHIE
I’m just saying maybe Jovi’s not
the greatest thing in the world

STEVE
Who the fuck are you

Richie doesn’t really know what to say to this Steve throws
one of the Bon Jovi tickets at Richie’s chest

STEVE (CONTD)
Here I got this for you Maybe you
should just throw it away

Steve walks away from Richie Steve waves to Big Night Out
and Bobby to follow him

STEVE (CONTD)
Let’s get the fuck outta here I
got sand in my socks

Big Night Out and Bobby give Richie a puzzled hurt look as
they take off with Steve down the beach Richie picks up the
Bon Jovi ticket and looks at it Chris walks up and sees the
ticket He puts his hand on Richie’s shoulder

CHRIS
Dude don’t sweat it Richie Bon
Jovi totally sucks

NOODLER
Yeah Bon Jovi was cool back in
like what 1988

CHRIS
Besides John Mayer’s coming in

Richie stares at the Bon Jovi ticket We hear the
sentimental bittersweet sounds of Bon Jovis Never Say
Goodbye as we dissolve into

MONTAGE - JERSEY SHORESTONE HARBOR

Richie and Molly are eating dinner at a nice restaurant They
are talking and having a good time Something catches
Richie’s eye He sees two trashy looking Jersey guys sharing
an order of macaroni balls outside on the boardwalk Richie’s
smile gradually fades

Steve is standing outside of Skee-Ball Zone in his uniform
watching the waves roll in A seagull lands next to him and
he tries to punch it He misses the seagull and it flies
away Steve gets a sad nostalgic look on his face

Richie is in his bedroom getting dressed He stops and
notices a bird perched on a tree branch outside his window
Richie grins to himself until his gaze drifts over to
find a 15-year-old white turd still resting on another
branch He stares wistfully at the turd

Wearing a tie Richie is sitting in the waiting room of an
office reading National Geographic A business logo on the
wall reads “EAST ORANGE REALTORS” A businessman in a suit
comes out of the office and greets Richie shaking his hand

Bobby is dribbling a basketball in SLOW MOTION He passes it
to Big Night Out Steve steals the ball and does a behind-the-
back pass to Dom who is so bad at basketball that he
double-dribbles travels shoots a shot that doesn’t even

come close to the rim and ultimately trips and falls onto
the ground The guys all shake their heads at Dom

Richie and Gerald are conversing by Gerald’s grill Geralds
prized cocker spaniel Ulysses runs up and drops a dog toy
at Richie’s feet Richie picks it up and throws it As
Ulysses chases after the toy we can see the dog’s way-too-
big “neuticals” practically dragging on the ground

INT RICHIE’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - RICHIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

You know you were always ragging
on Molly I actually thought she
was pretty cool And so Richie went
to a bachelor party Who can blame
him You gonna turn down free
ecstasy and all-night whores

BOBBY
And what are we doing all the time
Our lives are so intense you can’t
skip one night

STEVE
No you know what happened with
Richie He started hanging out with
Stone Harbor pussies and now he
thinks he’s better than us But you
know what I say Good riddance

Big Night Out and Bobby stare down at the bar

STEVE (CONTD)
Fuck this I’m gonna go boner-grind
the shit out of some chickenheads

Steve storms off toward a couple of sluts on the dance floor
He immediately starts boner-grinding one of their asses The
other girl completes a sandwich on the other side all three
of them dancing salaciously

ANGLE ON Steve’s expression He doesn’t seem to be enjoying
this as much as he should He clearly misses his friend

EXT STONE HARBOR BOAT CLUB - RECEPTION HALL - DAY

This is the reception for Chloe and Chris’ “Sunset in
Tuscany” themed wedding We see a lot of the same friends and
family from the barbecue here mingling hugging the bride and
groom and offering their congratulations

Richie and Molly approach Chloe and Chris Richie shakes
Chris’ hand and awkwardly gives Chloe a kiss on the cheek
Chloe instinctively recoils Richie looks a little hurt

RICHIE
Congratulations you two The
wedding was beautiful

CHRIS
(smelling the air)
Whoa Richie Are you sure you put
on enough cologne this morning

RICHIE
Why Do I need more I’ve got some
out in my car

CHRIS
Kidding bro

CHLOE
Yeah my eyes are literally
watering And not from joy

A few guests nearby chuckle Richie forces a laugh

RICHIE
Right right

Richie and Molly step away from the bride and groom
MOLLY

Sorry about that Chris and my
sister can be such snobs sometimes

RICHIE
It’s okay They were just joking

Nan waves to Molly from across the reception hall

MOLLY
Hey I have to help my mom with the
cake I’ll be back in five minutes

RICHIE
Sure sure

Molly looks at Richie She can tell something’s wrong

MOLLY
Are you okay Richie

RICHIE
Yeah I’m fine Go I’1l go get
some appetizers maybe a drink

Molly kisses Richie on the cheek and walks away Richie heads
over to the bar

BARTENDER
What can I get you sir

RICHIE
Uh I guess I’1l have a glass of
champagne

The bartender hands Richie a glass of champagne Richie
surveys the crowd of people in the reception hall

ANGLE ON An old fat guy in an expensive suit showing off his
fancy watch to other old fat guys in expensive suits

ANGLE ON Two of Chloe’s sorority friends with bored
expressions on their faces texting on their phones while
standing right next to each other

ANGLE ON A chain of corny fake looking guests dancing
absurdly as they take the congo line way too seriously

Richie observes all of this with a puzzled slightly
disillusioned look on his face

NOODLER (0S)
Richie come here for a sec You
gotta meet our bro Hastings

Richie turns to see Noodler and Fogelman standing with a well
dressed fat guy named HASTINGS Richie shakes his hand

RICHIE
Hey how you doing I’m Richie

HASTINGS
Sup dude

FOGELMAN
Hastings used to be our house
president at Sigma Phi Now he’s
kicking ass over at Allstate

RICHIE
Wow congratulations So you having
fun here at the wedding

HASTINGS
I guess I mean “Sunset in
Tuscany”

Hastings Noodler and Fogelman share a dismissive chuckle

RICHIE
What do you mean

HASTINGS
Tuscany is the most beautiful place
on Earth This is the Jersey Shore

RICHIE
What’s wrong with the Jersey Shore

NOODLER
Okay Stone Harbor’s not bad But
Richie you gotta admit most of
the Jersey Shore is complete shit

FOGELMAN
It’s like America’s garbage can
bro

Richie contemplates their words Should he acquiesce

RICHIE
Well some of it might be trashy
But I think a lot of it’s pretty
nice If nothing else there’s good
people here on the Shore

FOGELMAN
What like your friends

NOODLER
Yeah those greaseballs from the
beach Those pieces of shit
practically ruined our dude walk

HASTINGS
Oh please tell me they had like
orange skin and a whole tube of gel
in their hair

FOGELMAN
They totally did No exaggeration

Hastings Noodler and Fogelman start laughing again Richie
is now beginning to lose his patience

RICHIE
Listen call them what you want
Greaseballs or whatever But I grew
up with those guys my whole life

HASTINGS
That explains the suit from JC
Penny

Noodler and Fogelman both laugh Richie gives Hastings a
hard angry look

RICHIE

You may not believe it but those
guys are like my brothers

(turning to bartender)
One shot of Jagermeister please

(back to the guys)
They might be a little eccentric
They might have a slightly limited
taste in music and appreciate the
scent of a strong cologne But I’1l1
tell you what At least they have
strippers at their fuckin’ bachelor
parties

Richie grabs the Jagermeister shot from the bartender drops
it into his champagne glass and chugs the whole thing
Hastings Noodler and Fogelman look on in shock and
disapproval Hastings scoffs to Noodler and Fogelman

HASTINGS
This dude is such trash What’s he
even doing here

Richie SHOVES Hastings Hastings is so fat that he loses his
balance and collapses onto a table There are SHRIEKS and
GASPS among the party members

ANGLE ON Gerald has seen and overheard all of this Gerald
marches over to Richie

GERALD
Come with me

Gerald grabs Richie and pulls him over to a less crowded part
of the reception hall

GERALD (CONT’D)
What the hell do you think you’re
doing

RICHIE
I don’t know

Molly rushes up to Gerald and Richie

MOLLY
What’s going on here

GERALD
What’s going on here Your
boyfriend just shoved one of Chris’
friends into a table

MOLLY
Why What happened

GERALD
First of all he dropped an entire
shot of some rancid liquor into a
glass of Veuve and drank the whole
thing in one gulp Then before I
know it Hastings is lying on Dr
and Mrs Eakins’ table

MOLLY
I’m sure there’s an explanation
That guy Hastings is an asshole

GERALD
Richie I thought you were gonna
get out of your pathetic dead-end
little world and make something of
your life But I guess you just
wanna keep on playing skee-ball and
working on your tan and going
clubbing with your loser friends

MOLLY
Dad that’s enough
GERALD
Excuse me

MOLLY
No I’m sick and tired of you
always turning people into what you
want them to be

GERALD
I don’t do that

MOLLY
You did it to me What about law
school Dad You think I actually
wanna go to law school

GERALD
Of course you do You love the law

MOLLY
I don’t Dad You know I wanted to
be an ornithologist but you said
ornithologists don’t make enough
money So you threw out my bird
watching journal and all my books
and my feather collection--

GERALD
Feathers carry diseases

MOLLY
I don’t care I’d rather play with
feathers than put on a phony act
like I’m some big shot Look around
you Dad Are these people really
your friends Is this really you

GERALD
Of course it is This is who I’ve
always been

MOLLY
No it’s not Dad You may not
remember but I do I remember when
I was little you used to take me
to the Giants games and do push-ups
on the stadium steps whenever they
scored a touchdown I remember you
bragging about your Ms Pacman
score not how much money you made
I remember your long hair and those
goofy bandanas you used to wear

(MORE )

MOLLY (CONTD)

You didn’t care what other people
thought It was just you You were
so much fun back then

Gerald doesn’t know what to say

GERALD
Molly I

MOLLY
I’m not going to law school
anymore And I’m not gonna let you
do to Richie what you’ve been doing
to me my whole life

Molly takes Richie by the hand and leads him out of the
reception hall After they’ve left Gerald gradually absorbs
everything Molly has said with a stunned introspective look

EXT STONE HARBOR BOAT CLUB - DAY
Richie and Molly exit the boat club

RICHIE
Wow Look at the balls on you

MOLLY
That actually felt pretty good I
kind of got Jersey on his ass huh

RICHIE
Totally

They share a chuckle

RICHIE (CONT’D)
So what do we do now

Molly checks her watch

MOLLY
You’ve still got some time before
Bon Jovi takes the stage You
should go be with your friends
Richie

RICHIE
What are you saying

MOLLY
This is my family It’s my world
It shouldn’t have to be yours

Richie thinks about this for a moment

RICHIE
If I’m gonna go see Jovi and get my
mind totally blown the fuck away
then you gotta be there with me

MOLLY
But you only have one ticket

RICHIE
Either we get in together or we
don’t get in at all And from what
I’ve heard miracles are prone to
happen in the presence of Jovi

Richie takes Molly’s hand She smiles

INT EXT RICHIE’S PARKED CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Richie is in the driver’s seat with Molly beside him He
starts the car The engine sputters There is a huge BURST
Smoke comes out from under the hood They sadly get out of
Richie’s Camaro which is obviously not going anywhere

RICHIE
Fuck

Gerald exits the boat club and marches toward them

GERALD
Hey Stop right there

Richie and Molly exchange a worried look Gerald stops in
front of Richie takes the ticket from him and reads it

GERALD (CONTD)
Youre taking my daughter to a Bon
Jovi concert

RICHIE
I was going to

Richie gestures to the smoking engine of his car There is a
beat of tense silence Gerald stares at Richie

GERALD
Do you remember when I told you I
was a Manilow guy

Richie nods

GERALD (CONT’D)
Do you know why I’m a Manilow guy

Richie looks anxiously down at the ground

GERALD (CONT’D)
Because I was never lucky enough to
see the great Jon Bon Jovi in
concert

Richie looks back up at Gerald awestruck Gerald hands the
ticket back to Richie Molly beams at her father

EXT STONE HARBOR SUMMER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
We are TIGHT on Richie’s face as he talks on his cell phone

RICHIE
Why don’t any of you answer your
fuckin’ phones Steve it’s Richie
again I’m coming to the concert
You really think I’d miss Jovi
Fuck you I’m back Jersey baby

We PULL OUT to reveal Richie sitting on Gerald’s Honda Rebel
motorcycle parked in the driveway Molly is sitting on the
back her arms wrapped around her man

Richie REVS the engine and speeds off down the street

INT STEVE’S CAR - DAY
ANGLE ON Steve’s cell phone reads “5 NEW VOICE MAILS”

Steve is at the wheel with Big Night Out and Bobby They are
all wearing Bon Jovi T-shirts It’s obvious that the reason
why they couldn’t hear their phones ringing is that Bon
Jovis Wanted Dead or Alive is blasting on the radio

They are in a long line of cars waiting to get into the
Meadowlands parking lot Steve lays down on the HORN

STEVE
Let’s fuckin’ go already

EXT NEW JERSEY HIGHWAY - DAY

The Honda Rebel SCREAMS down the highway with Richie and
Molly onboard Wanted Dead or Alive continues to blare The
song seems like more than just a song at this point It’s an
anthem for a way of life

INT STONE HARBOR BOAT CLUB - RECEPTION HALL - DAY

Gerald is standing at the bar Chloe Chris Noodler
Fogelman and Hastings approach him

CHLOE
Dad I assume Molly’s gross
boyfriend plans on paying for
Hastings’ jacket

Gerald looks the guys over thinking to himself

GERALD
Okay I’ve got an idea Chris
Noodler Fogelman Hastings why
don’t you find yourselves an open
table I’1l send over some drinks
And maybe when you’re done you
can all go suck each other off

Shocked and appalled Chloe and the guys slowly back away
The bartender slides Gerald a glass of champagne and a shot
of Jager Gerald notices Nan standing nearby She has just
overheard everything She is glowing with a lustful smile
She saunters up to Gerald and flirtatiously fixes his tie

NAN
I have to say it’s been a long
time since I’ve seen you “go nuts”

Nan winks at Gerald He grins He drops his shot into his
champagne glass and downs it in one gulp

EXT MEADOWLANDS ENTRANCE - DAY

Bon Jovi fans are filing into the stadium for the concert
Just outside the entrance Richie and Molly are haggling with
a SCALPER a scruffy blue collar guy in his mid 50s

SCALPER
Like I said man it’s Jovi’s last
show 500 a ticket

RICHIE
All I got is 450 Come on buddy
Jovi me

The scalper thinks it over

SCALPER
All right lemme see the 450

Richie hands the scalper his money The scalper pockets it

SCALPER (CONT’D)
You know a lot of people say Bon
Jovi’s our state treasure that his
music represents everything Jersey
stands for But you know what I
say Bon Jovi can suck my dick

The scalper holds out his forearm to reveal a tattoo of Bruce
Springsteen’s face with gothic letters that read “THE BOSS”

SCALPER (CONTD)
Springsteen is the king of Jersey
I am so fuckin’ sick of Bon Jovi
stealing the spotlight Does Bon
Jovi have 19 Grammies and a fuckin’
planet named after him ‘Cause
Springsteen sure as shit does

The scalper starts to storm off

RICHIE
Whoa whoa Where’s my ticket

SCALPER
Fuck your ticket

Richie grabs the scalper by the arm

RICHIE
Look I gave you my money pal now
I want my fuckin’ ticket

SCALPER
Is that right Hey fellas

A crew of big gruff middle aged BLUE COLLAR GUYS walks up
and joins the scalper One of them rips open the top of his
shirt to reveal a tattoo across his pecs that reads “DANCING
IN THE DARK” Another one in a white T-shirt and jeans turns
around to show off his backside A red baseball cap hangs out
of his back pocket He dramatically leans to one side a la
the iconic album cover from Born in the USA

SCALPER (CONTD)
Too bad you weren’t born to run
kid ‘cause everybody here’s got a
hungry heart for kicking the shit
out of you

The scalper PUNCHES Richie in the face

MOLLY
Richie

Richie falls to the ground The scalper and his crew surround
Richie They’re about to put the boots to him when suddenly--

STEVE (0S)
Hey fuckfaces

Everyone turns to see Steve Big Night Out and Bobby standing
just inside the entrance

STEVE (CONTD)
Why don’t you go back to your cars
where you can jerk each other off
in private

SCALPER
Why don’t you come out here and
make us

One of the TICKET TAKERS gives Steve a cautionary look

TICKET TAKER
Buddy you walk out this gate
youre not coming back in

The ticket taker points to a sign that says “NO RE-ENTRY”
Steve considers this for a moment He shrugs

STEVE
Guess I won’t be fucking tonight

Steve rushes out followed by Big Night Out and Bobby Before
the scalper can defend himself Steve CLOCKS him in the face
knocking him to the ground An all-out BRAWL ensues

Big Night Out grabs a blue collar guy by his long beard and
HEADBUTTS him Bobby takes off his leather boot and BEATS the
shit out of a guy twice his size As Richie gets back to his
feet a Springsteen fan swings a beer bottle wildly at his
head Richie ducks and UPPERCUTS the guy on his chin

MOLLY
Kick his ass Richie

Molly sees another blue collar guy coming after Steve with a
screwdriver She KICKS him in the balls Steve witnesses it
with a look of amazement on his face

The fight spreads out drawing in more and more random people
outside of the stadium Jovi fans Springsteen fans security
guards The scene erupts into TOTAL CHAOS
EXT

MEADOWLANDS - MOMENTS LATER

fighting has finally died down A little ways off from
entrance Richie Molly Steve Big Night Out and Bobby
recuperating They look bruised and cut up

STEVE
That was fuckin’ awesome

RICHIE
See those Springsteen pussies
running away

BIG NIGHT OUT
Fuckin’ beautiful

Night Out slaps five with Richie

BOBBY
Hey weren’t you two supposed to be
at a wedding or some shit

MOLLY
Well Bobby this is Jovi were
talking about here

BOBBY
That is true

STEVE
Hey Molly I just wanna say
thanks for pulverizing those balls
on my behalf

MOLLY
No I should be thanking you
Steve You didn’t have to do what
you did back there

STEVE
Of course I did Nobody fucks with
members of our crew

MOLLY
But now you’1ll miss the concert

STEVE
It’s okay The Meadowlands smells
like fuckin’ diarrhea anyway

RICHIE
Miss the concert Hey we’re not
missing anything

EXT MEADOWLANDS PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

As the beautiful sun sets in the polluted Jersey sky Richie
Molly Steve Big Night Out and Bobby are drinking beers next
to Steve’s parked car We can hear the faint sounds of Bon
Jovi performing Keep the Faith live inside the Meadowlands

RICHIE
Just like old times right

STEVE
Just like old times

Richie turns to Bobby and for the first time notices Bobby’s
completely uninjured face

RICHIE
Bobby what happened to your face

BOBBY
What do you mean

RICHIE
It looks good No black eyes or
nothing even after a rumble

BIG NIGHT OUT
Bobby finally got some balls and
ended things with Crystal

RICHIE
Really

BOBBY
Yeah after you said all that shit
about feeling trapped it kind of
made sense to me or whatever

STEVE
But it wasn’t exactly a painless
breakup Show them Bobby

Bobby holds up his hand He is missing his pinkie finger

BOBBY
She got a samurai sword off Ebay

Steve hands out fresh beers to everyone He puts his arm
around Richie and holds up his beer for a toast

STEVE
To summertime To the annihilation
of pubes and body hair

(MORE)

STEVE (CONTD)
And most importantly to old and
new friends

MOLLY
And to farting in people’s mouths

STEVE
Oh shit Nice

Steve clinks beers with Molly The five of them chug their
beers A super hot 20-year-old girl walks by Big Night Out
winks at her and smiles

BIG NIGHT OUT
What’s up baby

The girl smiles back at him and continues on her way Bobby
gazes at Big Night Out in disbelief

BOBBY
You are attracted to her

BIG NIGHT OUT
Look she may not be a ten She may
not smell like garlic or have a
perfect hairy gaping vagina But
she had a nice smile which shows
she has a good heart And I realize
now that it’s not all about looks
It’s what’s on the inside that
counts you stupid fuck

THE END
