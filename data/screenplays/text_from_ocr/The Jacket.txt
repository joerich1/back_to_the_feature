sounds of the hospital and as his pulse quickens so

the pace of the world around him

WILLIAM STARKS (V0O)
I remember there was so much white
everywhere And I felt peaceeven
though there was war around me And I
felt alive even though I knew I was
dead

INTERN 1
Come on come on lets tag these
guys and get them out of here

An INTERN clipboard in hand stands above STARKS

body with another INTERN beside him INTERN 1 pulls
the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER

As the INTERN puts the TAGS back down she meets
STARKS wide-

open EYES -- now filled with surfacing tears sadness
and life

She stares at them curiously and after some seconds
STARKS

blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek -- jarring her

Oh my God This soldier is ALIVE

A NEWSANCHOR interviews CAPTAIN ROBERT MEDLEY (30s) --

particularly photogenic and affable participant

CAPTAIN MEDLEY
The level of arms on the ground
really depends Answering a
question But no Id have to say we
havent had to engage on the ground
as heavily as we might have expected

NEWSANCHOR
Have you lost any men today Captain

CAPTAIN MEDLEY
No One of my Corporals took a bullet
to the head but it looks like he
might make it Looks that way

EXT AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL DAY

STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head
BANDAGED and his arms suited with IVs and dressings

MAJOR a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him

STARKS face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it
is alert and striking Even with the bandages he
well-built and strong like a shot straight to the head

have been the only way for an enemy to take him down

DOCTOR
Sergeant Starks was very lucky A
little more to the right and it
wouldnt have wanted to come out

MAJOR
But hes never gonna be able to
remember what happened

DOCTOR
Its hard to say Sergeant Starks
could have retrograde amnesia
or lowering his voice any form of
psychological suppression Its very
common with traumas like this

STARKS Cutting him off
Sergeant Starks is in the room
ofa

the

beat and I want to know when Im
going home

When he speaks STARKS maintains the sharp steady gaze

man assured of himself even if he is lost among his
surroundings

LIEUTENANT
Sergeant you have no surviving
family in the States Im sure you
have friends or distant relatives
but unfortunately we have no record
of them yet

MAJOR
Captain Medley has recommended you
for the Purple Heart Sergeant

STARKS lets the tribute roll right off him He spots

CIGARETTES in the Lieutenants pocket

STARKS
Can I have one of those

LIEUTENANT
Of course

The LIEUTENANT lights one for him

There is help for you Sergeant

Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his
blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his

Hes finished with these men and everything they stand

STARKS V0O
I didnt know where my home was I
just knew I didnt want to be there
anymore

EXT HIGHWAY RURAL VERMONT WINTER DAY

STARKS -- recovered now -- walks by himself along a
highway He seems to be walking away from things even

cant remember what they are yet

EXT HIGHWAY RURAL VERMONT WINTER DAY

JEAN PRICE (30s) -- a hippie who happens to be a mother
her daughter JACKIE tremble in the cold next to
stalled car JEAN sits next to the car holding her

her chest more like a child than her daughter

JACKIE runs her little gloved hand over her moms ski-
head as she cautiously watches STARKS approach them He

an arresting figure against the empty landscape
JACKIE
Come on mom Dont fall asleep

STARKS
You two ok

JACKIE
Our car wont start

STARKS Looking at JEAN
Whats your moms name

JACKIE Cautiously
Jean

STARKS takes off his backpack and kneels down

STARKS
Jean Jean can you hear me I need
you to try to wake up Jean

JEAN opens her eyes stone red

STARKS
Your mom take anything before this
happened

JACKIE

Yeah but I dont know what
STARKS
Beat Whats your name

JACKIE
Jackie

JACKIE decidedly sticks out her gloved hand STARKS
smiles

and briefly shakes it STARKS rubs a hand over his chin
and

cheek as he thinks of what to do

STARKS
Nice to meet you Jackie Why dont
you wrap this scarf around yourself
and try to keep your mom awake while
I take a look at your car

EXT HIGHWAY RURAL VERMONT WINTER DAY

As Starks works on their engine JACKIE anxiously
watches her

mother throw up in the distance STARKS sees her
watching and
tries to distract her

STARKS
What do you think of all this snow

JACKIE looks at him curiously

JACKIE
Beat Nothing

STARKS looks at her and smiles at her honest answer
Jackie

turns her head back towards her mother
seat just

sputters

and

JACKIE
But I like it I guess

STARKS
Hey can you reach the gas pedal

JACKIE
Yeah
JACKIE gets behind the wheel crouching down in the

enough so her foot reaches the pedal

STARKS

Go ahead turn it on Keep pushing

it
JACKIE revs up the engine and a few coughs and
later the car settles into a nice working hum

JACKIE Smiling

It works
JACKIE steps down She looks like she could hug Starks
unexpectedly decides to As STARKS awkwardly returns

sees JEAN lifting her eyes to see him holding her

JEAN
Get your fucking hands off my
daughter
JACKIE
Mom he just fixed our car

JEAN
Jackie get in the car NOW

JEAN reaches for a RIFLE in the back of the truck but
stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up

JEAN
Look I dont want any trouble so

STARKS
Neither do I maam Ill be on my
way

JACKIE

Mom youve got it wrong

STARKS motions for JACKIE to stop as he collects his
bags

JACKIE

STARKS

she gets back behind the wheel
STARKS DOG TAGS are tied to the ZIPPER of one of his
bags

JACKIE

STARKS unties them and gives them to her She reads

STARKS

CUT TO
INT COURTROOM SMALL TOWN VERMONT

STARKS faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic

about him and a confused look on his face as a MENACING

VOICE (0S)
Jackie and Jean are the only

things you know for certain about
that day

VOICE (0S)
Are you aware we have no last name
no place of residence and no record
of any physical presence for these
friends of yours Hows that
possible in this day and age

as a muffled Objection flickers away in

With Starks

VOICE (0S)
I may need to actually hear that
answer Mr Starks

STARKS
Beat Yes
answer the background of the courtroom is
suddenly illuminated and we see that THIS IS STARKS
OWN

TRIAL The VOICE belongs to a satisfied PROSECUTION who
turns

to face a medium-sized CROWD watching on

INT COURTROOM SMALL TOWN VERMONT

There are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand
CAPTAIN

MEDLEY Starks commanding officer in the Persian Gulf
DR

HALE a psychiatrist and OFFICER NASH the cop who
first

came upon the crime scene Their three testimonies are

intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and

confusingly -- just like it appears to himself

OFFICER NASH Emotional
Eddie correcting himself Officer
Harrison was lying in a pool of his
own blood -- on his back

DR HALE
William Starks could be blocking the
incident It would explain his well-
systematized scheme about the little
girl and her mother A delusion as
complex as that can often replace the
reality of an incident like this

OFFICER NASH Contd
Officer Harrisond been shot three
times He was long dead by the time
we got there

DR HALE
I have heard of Gulf War Syndrome
The medical community is only
beginning to gather information about
it

PROSECUTION
Gulf War Syndrome What theWhy
dont we start diagnosing Hard Life
Syndrome while were at it Ive
gotten a lot of convictions we could
overturn with that logic

CAPTAIN MEDLEY
Sergeant Starks was awarded the
Purple Heart That award doesnt
applaud violence or murder Beat It
applauds honor

DR HALE Contd
His subconscious is blocking it the
same way it began to in the Gulf
particularly as something similarly
traumatizing happened to him then

The following summations are punctuated by the BLACK

FADES

between them and the simulated BLACK around them as
they

speak -- like STARKS at the beginning of his own
testimony

PROSECUTION Disdainfully
Its not a question of whether or not
he was sane when he did it He
absolutely was Three bullets in one
man are three moral failings in
another

CAPTAIN MEDLEY Incensed
War isnt a CNN Special Half the
shit that went on couldnt be tidied
into a top of the hour headline --
either cause it couldnt be said
neatly or cause it couldnt be said
at all It was ugly And they dont
put ugly on TV Looking at Starks
If Starks did kill that officer
Beat You cant hold a man
responsible for a damaged mind

DEFENSE
For Gods sake my client said he
thinks hes already died once He
doesnt know whats going on

both

behind We

hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment

I dont know how it happened

unconsciousness

The JUDGE nods as he hands the JURY FOREMAN back the
verdict
JURY FOREMAN
On the count of first degree murder
we find the defendant William
Starks not guilty by reason of
insanity

EXT HIGHWAY RURAL VERMONT WINTER DAY

In his mind STARKS is walking out of the woods as the
sun

sets and bounces off the snow all around him We see
JACKIE

watching him walk away into the woods

JUDGE (0S)
I hereby sentence you to be committed
to a facility for the criminally
insane where I hope that doctors and
the proper treatment can help you

decided he had to

EXT ALPINE GROVE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL DAY

A white VAN pulls up to Alpine Grove Psychiatric
Hospital -- a

bleak dated facility embellished only by the barbed
wire

that seems to be everywhere around it

STARKS anatomy instantly and intensely separates him

from
the staff of the hospital and the infirm patients who
might
be in it TWO MEMBERS of that STAFF lead him in

Mr Starks I hope that someday you
might be well so that we will have
lost only one life in this tragedy

madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden

INT STARKS ROOM WARD ALPINE GROVE DAY

STARKS is shown to his room by NURSE HARDING -- stern
and her henchman DAMON -- a BURLY ORDERLY who relishes

command however diluted it may be

DAMON unceremoniously puts Starks UNIFORM on the bed

NURSE HARDING wait at the door for Starks to change

DAMON looks at STARKS -- his eyes inadvertently

Starks is more threatening than the common senile he
marshals STARKS stares him back -- deliberately

that hes right

STARKS turns around -- only then looking stunned in the
sterile cotton-white room wondering where his life
disappeared to

BECKER Cutting him off firmly
Its not my job to believe you or to
understand you Its my job to try to
cure you and if thats a no-go then
totake some kind of care of you

From STARKS POV we follow him walk down the

already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET is crammed

They bolt the drawer and the CLANG echoes through his
The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as

We see only the WHITES of a pair of petrified EYES ona
whos losing it -- hyperventilating suffocating for

Its now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more
stares at it Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern
formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to
before they change into something else Only after
blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is
from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming

the following glimpses each hardly longer than the
between BLINKS

1) A little river of RED marring the snow around it

spilling from

2) OFFICER HARRISONS mouth just seconds before his

breath His eyes close and STARKS sees and hears a

BLOOD sprays STARKS hands as he looks down at them and
realizes hes in the scene and not just watching it He

up from his hands and sees in similar flashes

stares at it This time the little river of RED comes

2) The BODIES of IRAQI villagers all still except

3) That of a IRAQI WOMAN She unflinchingly lays her
hand in the entrails of a CORPSE and smears its

blood on her face just before she lies back down among
the dead content to be one of them

The only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been
trapped mans anxious BREATHS and the BEATS of a HEART
pumping so fast it could be a drum

The screen goes BLACK and QUIVERS as STARKS clenches

shut

Just then as the MUSCLE beneath his eyes starts to

STARKS sits totally disoriented in the ward with the
more vocally INSANE patients He runs his hand
over the SCARS on his arm from the Jacket and looks

not knowing where his PARANOIA ends and REALITY begins

The OLD MAN from the previous day is moving slowly with

aid of his walker He is far less threatening to STARKS
todayjust a senile man about to walk into a wall

STARKS Getting up to help him
Lets get you a destination other
than this wall

RUDY MACKENZIE -- 40s smart eyes fidgety with an
face -- watches STARKS help turn the OLD MAN around
MACKENZIE

Thats Kingsley Old bastard hears
us Im sure He just doesnt want to
bother answering so he makes us think
he cant talk I know I tried it on
my mother for two months once before
she fished out my tongue Literally

gesture any active mind Sticking
out a jittery hand Rudy MacKenzie

MACKENZIE (contd)
Welcome to the village William
Starks

STARKS doesnt offer his hand just looks back at
MacKenzie

STARKS Looking away
Im not really in the mood to talk

MACKENZIE
Thats too bad I dont believe in
disposable language either -- you
know the small talk the little
talk Chit Chat Useless The games
something else though Think about
it What can we trade with each other
in the air between us This
running his hand through the air is
our court Beat so eager its sad
Im ready to throw the ball Come on

STARKS looks at MACKENZIE and sees that the constant
flow of
words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation
in his
eyes A dead arm hangs limply by his side like a
weight

STARKS Relenting
What are you in here for

MACKENZIE
I tried to kill my wife

STARKS
Dont you go to jail for that
MACKENZIE
I tried something like 30 times
There is as STARKS rightly figures no suitable
response to
that

MACKENZIE
Shes bigger than me and shes
stronger than me And I never planned
on doing it It was always in the
heat of the moment I didnt beat her
or anything Hell she beat me But
when wed start fighting Id go for
the knife Then she kept threatening
to have me put away and looking
around she finally did

As he talks MACKENZIE notes the SCARS on Starks arms

Dr

LORENSON observes STARKS and MACKENZIE talking and
starts

walking towards them

STARKS
Yeah well 30 times probably would
make you seem crazy

MACKENZIE
Or just plain stupid Youd think by
the twentieth time Id have found an
alternative method Maybe a more
effective one if you know what I
mean

DR LORENSON
Morning gentlemen How are you doing
today

MACKENZIE winks discreetly at STARKS before he replies

MACKENZIE
Its a hard one for me Dr Lorenson
Finally turns to face her grimly
The world around me its shrinking
Theres not even room for light to
make its way in Beat Da-da-bum Da-
da-bum I feel like the horseman of
doom is coming for me Doc Only
today hes not carrying flowers

LORENSON reprimands MacKenzie by turning to Starks

MACKENZIE
What Its better than fine

DR LORENSON
And you Mr Starks

STARKS Already on the defense
Im fine

DR LORENSON
Mr MacKenzie do you think I could
talk to Mr Starks privately

MACKENZIE
Of course you can Doc William it
was an absolute pleasure Thanks for
playing

Just before he walks away MACKENZIE turns around
nervously
and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye

MACKENZIE
Heywhen they talk you out to the
woods tonight and invite the wolves
dance with them Beat They dont
eat you when theres music playing

STARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly wondering if his

words

were directed or just the meandering of a nut But
MacKenzie

just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks
away --

dead arm in tow

DR LORENSON
So youre ok

STARKS Still distracted
What

DR LORENSON
I asked you if youre ok

STARKS Suspiciously
I dont know You tell me Doc You
think theres anything wrong with me

DR LORENSON
I dont know Youre not my patient

STARKS looks away Lorenson gives him a once over

DR LORENSON
You look like youve lost some
weight Are you eating
STARKS
I am One of the few things I
remember doing is eating So I guess
I must be exercising it off in my
dreams

STARKS looks at LORENSON seeing if hell respond

LORENSON
looks back curiously at STARKS pointed stare
STARKS
You done with your small talk
DR LORENSON
Sure
STARKS
Good
STARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that
doesnt
escape LORENSONs observation

With that DAMON walks out leaving STARKS on the

STARKS walks stoically down the cold corridors to his

torture -- flanked by HARDING and DAMON on either side

INT MORGUE BASEMENT ALPINE GROVE CHRISTMAS EVE

Theyre all in the room STARKS seems pretty calm Only

CU do we see his eyes register the JACKET

BECKER
Im glad to see youre cooperating
this time Mr Starks

STARKS looks at the WIDE STURDY restraints on it They
really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could

them They might even knock someone out

DAMON and HARDING move to undress him when STARKS
move to do it himself They look to DR BECKER who NODS

its all right

DAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he

on one of Starks bare feet
and
GRABS THE

shocked at

STARKS doesnt flinch He merely turns away from them
bends down to take off his pants On his way up he

JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and using it like a weapon aims
smack it across Damons face DAMON deftly ducks and

JACKET hits BECKER instead The force of the blow sends
Becker down and as he falls against the wall DAMON

HARDING leap to restrain Starks

BECKER opens and closes his eyes trying to get them

focus His right cheek is cut pretty bad DR GRIES

BECKER to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up

floor BECKER puts them on

DR GRIES
Hold him while I get the
tranquilizer

DAMON
Fuck the tranquilizer I got a foot

DAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back nearly sending him

BECKER
No Thats not necessary
BECKER looks down and sees his own BLOOD fall on the
He looks up at STARKS who even in his pain looks

the force he just used
BECKER
Let him go More firmly I said let
him go

As soon as they let him go STARKS lunges for BECKER --
pushing him up against the wall STARKS stops

presumably
about to harm Becker but unsure even to himself of
what
hes capable of doing
BECKER looks fearlessly into Starks eyes

BECKER An inch away from his
face
What Starks What are you going to
do End me just because Im an
inconvenience to you Beat Just
like you did with Officer Harrison
STARKS face registers the meaning in Beckers words
and a
look of self-doubt crosses his face
BECKER
The only thing your mind is missing
is a conscience
STARKS lets go of him and as soon as he does DAMON
and

HARDING restrain him BECKER calmly wipes the BLOOD
from his

face looks at his hand shakes his head and walks out

INT BECKERS OFFICE ALPINE GROVE CHRISTMAS EVE SOME

LATER

BECKER turns around from the window and we see that his

is BANDAGED He opens a drawer takes out some SCOTCH

pours himself a SHOT He swallows some pills with it

After he drinks it he looks up to see GRIES standing
opposite him watching

DR GRIES

proclivities You know peel away

some of those layers of hate The
Jackets merely a safe place for that
to happen The grounds and the halls --
where I cant monitor side effects I
cant predict -- arent

DR GRIES Still doubtful
But butwhat about

BECKER shakes his head laughing inside at the worlds

towards

A shot of the WALL OF DRAWERS with no one in the room

someone in the wall

INT CADAVER DRAWER

STARKS finds himself in the physically wrenching place
more But nothing happens for some seconds He breathes
anxiously not knowing what to expect His heart beats

steadily THUMPTHUMP until finally with each

SMALL WHITE FLECK becomes two flecksthen two
dotsthen two circlesthen the WHITES of a pair

EYES with a terrific meanness in them

The EYES blink then disappear like they were never

The pace of STARKS heart quickens and the

madness surrounds him once more
EXT MURDER SCENE HIGHWAY VERMONT DUSK

The SOUNDS of BOMBS RAGE around him but hes in the

middle of
the murder scene watching OFFICER HARRISON lie on the
floor
He turns to look over his shoulder and sees

EXT IRAQI VILLAGE NIGHT
Through a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN NIGHT-VISION CAMERA we
see FIRE
FLESH and RUIN littering the sand Slowly the
terrifying images shift to a naturalistic real-time
documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as its
occurring
As STARKS blinks TEARS fall and he hears over it all
a
counseling voice
MACKENZIE (0S)
When they take you out to the woods
tonight and invite the wolves dance
with them
The TERRIBLE SOUNDS become less terrible as they fade
away

MACKENZIE (0S)
They dont eat you when theres music
playing

The scene morphs slowly and the following IMAGES appear
vaguely -- forming the walls of the TUNNEL around him
1) CU A WOMANS NECK and a small childs HAND

2) INT STAIRWAY OLD HOUSE (STARKS CHILDHOOD HOME)

3) CU A black and white PHOTOGRAPH

4) EXT CREEK A shot of clear water not too deep

5) EXT A NEW ENGLAND BEACH

6) EXT DESERT IRAQ A sublime sunset

STARKS walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the

IMAGES

They move like theyre liquid and when they settle
the

whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a
BEAUTIFUL

WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a
COFFEE

SHOP moving a STRAND OF HAIR out of her face with her
hand

STARKS blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her He
reaches

out and closes his PALM around her like he might catch
hold

of the moment with this simple gesture

The whole WALL OF IMAGES twinkles marvelously as we

cut To

removed

EXT DINER SMALL TOWN VERMONT CHRISTMAS EVE

The WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired with kind eyes soft
and a beautiful mouth that hasnt smiled in a long time

emerges from the diner Even with no effort she is
remarkably pretty

From her UNIFORM we know that her day was spent there
STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly

from the world around her The only fact she wears on

that shes tired

She spots STARKS and cant help but do a double-take
are momentarily taken with each other though she tries

hide any indication that she is

INT WAITRESS CAR

She gets in her old car and starts it As it warms up

looks for STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR and sees hes

there

He starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her

EXT PARKING LOT DINER VERMONT CHRISTMAS EVE
The WAITRESS treads angrily towards STARKS

WAITRESS
Where do you think youre going

STARKS looks at her He doesnt know anymore than she

does
WAITRESS
You gonna answer me
STARKS just stares
WAITRESS
If youre deaf read my lipsI
dont need a psycho following me
today
STARKS
Beat Im not deaf
WAITRESS
Good
She turns and gets back in her car slamming the door
shut
She starts to drive and STARKS stares after her

After a few hundred yards she SLAMS on the brakes and
turns

the car round coming back Then she jumps out of the
car and
heads back in the diner without looking over at

STARKS
EXT DINER SMALL TOWN VERMONT SOME SECONDS LATER
She comes out -- this time PURSE in hand -- and sighs
at
Starks
WAITRESS
As if she owes him an explanation I
forgot my purse
STARKS nods slowly The WAITRESS gets in her car and
looks
again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR He has hardly
any

winter gear on him -- no gloves no hat no coat --
just jeans

and a flannel He looks lost among his surroundings as
much

because he doesnt know where he is as because he
doesnt

look like he belongs there

She reverses towards him

WAITRESS
In case you hadnt figured its
Christmas Eve Youre never gonna get
a cab here

STARKS
Beat Thanks

She looks him over and then rests her hands on the
wheel

WAITRESS
All right Beat You got somewhere
you need to go Mister

STARKS
Im not sure

WAITRESS
Let me ask you that again This time
look around and consider your
options

Being cold and freezing are his options

WAITRESS

Beat You got somewhere you need to
go Mister

STARKS Nodding slowly
Yeah I do

WAITRESS
Great get in

INT WAITRESS CAR

WAITRESS
So where do you want me to drop you
STARKS rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he
thinks it
over She watches him curiously

STARKS
Im not sure

WAITRESS
You dont have anywhere to stay

STARKS
I dont think so

The WAITRESS takes out a FLASK and a sizable SWIG from
it

she swallows it smoothly like someone used to doing
so

WAITRESS
Well where are you from

STARKS
Im not sure Beat I dont really
know

WAITRESS

Of course you dont know

STARKS
Why of course

WAITRESS
Because in my life it wouldnt make
sense for me to pick up some normal
guy with a place where hes from and
a place where hes going to Itd be
too simple I probably wouldnt know
how to handle a situation like that

STARKS
Well you definitely didnt pick
normal or simple this time either

She looks over at him -- momentarily suspicious He
looks back
innocuously theres something innately safe about him

WAITRESS
At least youre honest Thats some
kind of start
STARKS sees her take another DRINK from the flask She
pulls
out a CIGARETTE and STARKS lights it for her with some
MATCHES
WAITRESS
Thats great Youre not sure where
youre from or where youre going
but at least youve got manners
She laughs noticeably more relaxed now after the
drink
WAITRESS
Well you got a coat or something
STARKS Looking down at his
clothes

No Doesnt look like it
WAITRESS
Well howd you get here

STARKS
Beat I was dropped off

WAITRESS
Do you have a motel or something
Money

STARKS feels his pockets

STARKS
No

WAITRESS
Well dont you somewhere Stuff
Belongings

STARKS

No Beat Not around here

She casts a long sideward glance at STARKS taking him
and
her circumstances in for herself He looks back gently

WAITRESS
All right well get to my place and
call around see where I can take
you Beat Just dont think of
trying anything

(MORE)

WAITRESS (contd)
I have the biggest defense for gun
control living upstairs from me
Shes armed and angry even when shes
asleep

INT WAITRESS APARTMENT EVENING

She is on the PHONE calling various shelters Her
apartment

has some pieces of mismatched furniture along with a
string

of lopsided CHRISTMAS LIGHTS strewn around the
WINDOWS in the

room They more than anything else light the place

WAITRESS Pleading tone
I could have him there in 15 minutes
Beat disappointed Hmm Yeah
thanks Merry Christmas to you too

She hangs up the phone

WAITRESS
Great That was our last option What
am I going to do with you

STARKS

guilty And Ive already got more
guilt than I know what to do with
Beat Do you want something to
drink

STARKS
No Im ok
She leaves to the KITCHEN to fix herself a drink and
stares after her Suddenly a SMASHING SOUND is heard
something falls in the kitchen STARKS whole BODY

as he wonders whether hes being taken out of the

WAITRESS
Shit That was one of my good
glasses

As she presumably cleans it up we stay on STARKS who
gains hold of himself She comes back DRINK in hand
pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way

did when he saw her in the tunnel Even through her
weariness she looks radiant under the Christmas

takes a long SIP
WAITRESS Noticing hes shaken
Hey you ok

STARKS
Beat Yeah Im fine

WAITRESS
You know what Its Christmas Eve
And you look clean -- I mean youre

normal-looking Resolutely for her
own benefit Its Christmas Eve and
I have a couch

And sadly no plans for the evening anyway She looks
back --
her EYES even more tired from the liquor

STARKS
Im not gonna hurt you

WAITRESS Softly
I know Clearing her throat Im
gonna go take a bath Make yourself
at home You know fix yourself
something to eat if youre hungry or
anything Theres nothing to steal

STARKS

way

WAITRESS Shakes her head
No no Lets not do the name stuff

STARKS nods as she walks out

EXT YARD BEHIND WAITRESS APARTMENT EVENING

STARKS still without a coat collects some WOOD

INT KITCHEN WAITRESS APARTMENT EVENING

STARKS looks in her fridge Theres not much to work
with --

just some JARS and plenty of VODKA

INT LIVING ROOM WAITRESS APARTMENT SOME TIME LATER

STARKS has lit a FIRE and set out a feeble dinner for
them

when the WAITRESS comes out of the bedroom in sweats

WAITRESS
Whats this

STARKS
The best I could do with what was in
your fridge
She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and

SANDWICH on two different colors of TOAST on the other
Then she looks over at the fire its obvious from the

way
she looks at it that its been years if ever since
someones done something like this for her
STARKS
I only lit it because it was so cold
in here Im sorry if
WAITRESS
No its fine Beat swallow
Thanks
She turns and goes in the kitchen calling out to
him
WAITRESS
You want a drink
STARKS
Sure
INT KITCHEN WAITRESS APARTMENT NIGHT
As she makes their DRINKS a curious LOOK crosses her
face
just for a second
INT LIVING ROOM WAITRESS APARTMENT A LITTLE WHILE
LATER
Theyve sat down to eat under the blinking CHRISTMAS
LIGHTS

WAITRESS
This is pretty good Considering

STARKS
Thanks

They eat quietly for a second STARKS looks at her
then down
at his food still subtly stunned by it all

STARKS
So youre a waitress right I
meanfrom the uniform you were
wearing

WAITRESS

Yup Thats me

STARKS
You like it

WAITRESS
Beat I do it

STARKS
Have you always been a waitress

WAITRESS Remembering sadly
No I used to be a nurse

STARKS
Beat Whyd you stop
WAITRESS
Shit happens and your life changes
Bout the best explanation of a lot
of things that happen Beat So how
come you dont know where youre
coming from

STARKS
I dont know but I think part of
its

STARKS looks around as he decides to be honest with
her

STARKS
That I dont really know whats real

She stares at him until a small sympathetic smile
appears on
her lips

WAITRESS
Well good for you

STARKS
Beat Why

WAITRESS
Beat Real is overrated

STARKS smiles back uncertainly
STARKS
You dont think thats crazy

WAITRESS
Maybe Beat Maybe not

She holds up her glass somewhat sadly

WAITRESS
Sometimes I dont know the difference
myself And you know something I
think I like it better that way
Finishes her drink You want another
one

She goes to the KITCHEN and STARKS clears their

PLATES

INT LIVING ROOM WAITRESS APARTMENT

STARKS goes in the KITCHEN as she comes out with their

drinks He hears her turn on the RADIO She lands on an

OLDIES station thats playing Girl of North Country
by Bob

Dylan

INT KITCHEN WAITRESS APARTMENT NIGHT

STARKS smiles a little then realizes he remembers and

likes the song Its the first familiar thing for him
in

days

He walks out slowly to the living room where the
WAITRESS

sits on the couch drinking STARKS moves closer to the
radio leaning into it listening and forgetting for a

short
while -- only as long as a piece of song -- everything

else

BOB DYLAN
If you go when the snow flakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer

ends
Please see she has a coat so warm
To keep her from the howlin winds

STARKS listens close -- smiling a small sad smile

Over the
HARMONICA we pull back and see two very lonely people
passing time together the way people sometimes need to

be
able to

STARKS
This is a great song

WAITRESS
You remember it

STARKS Nodding slowly
Its like I feel likeI know who I
am I just cant remember anything
that made me this person

When STARKS looks at her then hes so close to a

meltdown
that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it

STARKS
But hey who can forget those words
The man just wants simple and good
things for his woman -- that she be
warm and happy How hard can that be
to remember

WAITRESS
May be easy to remember but not easy
to get Being warm maybe -- but

look you dont even have a coat and
I still have to chop wood to make a
fire Beat And being happyyou
tell me if thats simple

The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flash drowsily to their own tempo

WAITRESS re the lights
Why dont I try to get them to stop
blinking

INT LIVING ROOM WAITRESS APARTMENT AN HOUR OR SO
LATER

She is visibly drained after the day and the drinks

STARKS
They told me I joined the army when I
was seventeen Thats when my father
died and before that it was
apparently just me and him since I
was born cause my mom split

WAITRESS
So you never knew your mother

STARKS
I guess not But as of now I never
knew either

WAITRESS
Im sorry

STARKS
Yeah Beat How about you

WAITRESS
Never knew my father I grew up with
my mother Actually I grew up around
my mother She was great though I
mean the way she was with her
friends She was this woman who had
so much life in her she had to find
ways to kill some of it just to be
like the rest of us Beat She died
young

STARKS
How

WAITRESS
She fucked herself up day after day
and then one day she fell asleep
with a burning cigarette Beat I
came home from work and she was gone

The TEARS still run after all these years

Yeah thats when I stopped being a
nurse I never thought I could stop
being one I wanted it for so long
but you just cant do it anymore
when you lose someone like that You
cant take care of other people
She closes her eyes and finally passes out STARKS

her face lit serenely by the FIRE and the Christmas

It bears her grief even in sleep

He covers her with a BLANKET then looks around and
only PERSONAL EFFECTS in the room on her mantle He
towards them tripping slightly on a CORD from the

stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the

As he pulls himself up he spots what is only inches
from where his hand landed on the wall HIS OWN DOG

swallow the improbability and inexplicability of the
situation

figure out whats happening On the console is an OLD

his way to the PILE

The label on the first BILL reads Jackie Price On
second the same And the thirduntil at the bottom
pile STARKS spots an OLD NEWSPAPER with the answer on
DATE December 3 2004

STARKS is absolutely stunned

STARKS looks over at JACKIE and just then the HARSH
of the DRAWER being opened rings deafeningly in his
the image of her starts to DISSOLVE at this worst

is being taken out of the JACKET

afraid of what theyve done to this man

Sure enough she answers with a STIR in her sleep

INT BATHROOM JACKIES APARTMENT CHRISTMAS MORNING

As JACKIE closes the MEDICINE CABINET she sees her

reflection in it

She puts her face under the WATER and lets it restore

color and life in her As she comes up thats when she
remembers the night before and the voice she barely

her sleep

STARKS 0S echoing distantly
Jackie Beat What year is it
She SHOOTS UP from the sink staring at her reflection

INT LIVING ROOM JACKIES APARTMENT SECONDS LATER
JACKIE spots STARKS asleep on the couch -- newspaper

strewn
all around him and the TV still on Hes holding the
TAGS
She kneels down close to his face and stares at him for
awhile before STARKS is jarred He defensively GRABS
HER
WRIST as his EYES BURST OPEN startling her
JACKIE Desperately
Who are you
STARKS lets his GRIP loosen
STARKS
Beat Im William Starks
A short look of SHOCK cross her face before she leaps
up
JACKIE
Get the hell out of my house
JACKIE grabs the nearest object -- the IRON FORK from
the
FIREPLACE set -- and holds it shaking against STARKS
STARKS

stays calm he hardly expected a different reaction

JACKIE
Whatd you do Snoop all over the
place You had no right You had no
right to go through anything

STARKS
Beat I know it doesnt make sense
It doesnt even make sense to me

JACKIE
If you dont get out of my house

Your mom was passed out on the side
of the road when I found you Her
name was Jean Beat She was dizzy
the whole time

STARKS

JACKIE
No you didnt They found William
Starks body dead in the snow

STARKS
Howd he die

JACKIE
I dont know But he did die

STARKS falters under the news JACKIE looks around

her now blurred eyes like she might find some help in

She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the

lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink then
laughs nervously as she looks up

JACKIE
I know what this isI picked you up

STARKS looks at her tenderly before he turns to leave
JACKIE a little calmer looks at the door like hes

still on

the other side of it and calls out softly and sadly

JACKIE
Happy Birthday

suddenly

faces the massacred village in Iraq Shocked at whats

happening to his body he looks up petrified His body
is

wound as tightly as a knot

Opposite Starks stands a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER --

anger and pointing his gun at a LITTLE BOY presumably
belonging to the MAN not five feet away Next to Starks

angry CAPTAIN MEDLEY ordering STARKS to follow him

is watching himself in the scene

MEDLEY
You walk on They pick up their guns
and fire at you you stay They pick
up and fire at each other and you
walk on

STARKS
Hes got his gun pointed at a kid

MEDLEY
That is not our problem

STARKS
Yeah well none of this is our
fuckin problem

STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER
threatening to shoot a child We hear him YELLING in

What STARKS doesnt see is another IRAQI SOLDIER his GUN at STARKS

We are leaving this site right now

STARKS doesnt hear him hes busy perfecting his aim

soldier
Hey

At the force of the word the SOLDIER lowers his gun
and the

LITTLE BOY flees

slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER Neither speaks

their eyes Neither moves his off the other

Just then though we see the SECOND IRAQI SOLDIER get
a

clear aim at STARKS

He takes his SHOT before anyone else does STARKS goes
down

as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off

He falls to the ground As the rest of the picture
fades to

black all that is left is previously mysterious still

haunting PAIR of EYES that we now see belonged to the

CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER

And over it all is the now more distant CLANK OF METAL

I tried to ask you if we should leave
him in yesterday
BECKER
Dont get all worked up Justin I
expected some common sense on your
part and clearly I was expecting too
much Beat Just open the drawer
DR GRIES
We never should have done this to
him
BECKER
Well what are we gonna do about it now
Nothing is Gries answer Still Becker seems to share
the
concern
BECKER motions for them to open the drawer They pull
him

DR BECKER stops walking and waits a moment
registering the
voice before he turns around to face Dr Lorenson

LORENSON Out of breath
Wheres William Starks

BECKER
Hes recovering on the third floor

LORENSON
Are you kidding me Hes not
psychotic

BECKER
Then how would you describe him
Beth Merely rebellious

LORENSON
Hell be a zombie in a few days Tom
His behaviors hardly suggested he
needed neuroleptics

BECKER
And you know that from what a couple
two-minute stares across a room

LORENSON Firmly
He didnt need anti-psychotics if
thats even all youre giving him

BECKER ignores Lorensons insinuation and merely turns
his

CHEEK all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see
the

BANDAGE from the CUT Starks gave him

BECKER Steadily
After he slashed me with a hospital
instrument I determined in my
professional opinion that Mr
Starks needed a little placating

LORENSON
Beat You sure he wasnt provoked

BECKER
You sure you want to begin making
that kind of insinuation Beat I
took five stitches during a routine
therapy session

LORENSON
Im sure he took some too

BECKER Smirking unphased
Happens sometimes when youve got to
restrain them You watch the rest of
us work You know that

LORENSON Appealing to him
Our patients are sick

BECKER
Yes they are

LORENSON looks at BECKER he knows hes hiding
something

LORENSON
Hes not gonna end up like Casey
Tom Whatever happened to him is not
going to happen to Starks I dont
know what youre trying to do here
but hes not a lab animal Tom
You cant reprogram him no matter the
drugs or the treatment

BECKER
Jesus you really dont let up do
you Just because you failed your
patient doesnt necessarily mean the
rest of us did too Beat Sorry to
tarnish your war heros image but he
is psychotic

A NURSE is checking on STARKS as he slowly wakes up

STARKS
What the hell kind of drugs are you
people giving me

STARKS is asking the NURSE but its BECKERs voice

answers though Starks cant see him

BECKER 0S
Just something to help you sleep

STARKS panics when he hears the voice He looks around
nervously but the BRIGHT SUNLIGHT pouring into the room
blinding He swallows as he looks at the NURSES FACE
continues adjusting his pillows
STARKS Swallowing nervously
Did you say something
The NURSE shakes her head lightly and just then BECKER
out of the LIGHT
BECKER
I said the drugs were to help you
sleep Beat Did you sleep well
Becker is remarkably calm further confusing Starks

reality
STARKS Doubtfully
But I wasnt asleep Was I

BECKER
Yes You were You were asleep for
nearly a whole day Its December
26th William

STARKS sits up groggily remembering what happened to
him and
wondering how much if any of it was real

STARKS
Its December 26th

STARKS examines himself -- looking at his arms
spotting the
BRUISES on them

BECKER
Thats right William

STARKS Slowly figuring it out

1992
BECKER nods STARKS sits up -- his predicament and the
room
slowly coming into focus

BECKER
Yes Caustically And thats the sun
and youre on earth Beat And I
know you know better

STARKS begins to piece if together BECKER as we begin

to
see is right It is 1992 in Alpine Grove
STARKS
I dont know better All I know is
that you left me in there
BECKER
In where
STARKS
Uncertainly In that thingthe
Jacket
The NURSE gives Becker a knowing look -- suggesting
Starks
really is delusional Becker doesnt even flinch as
STARKS

tries to get a better look at Beckers face

BECKER
We were forced to use restrains if
thats what youre referring to

STARKS
That wasnt a fucking restraint

BECKER
Actually thats exactly what our
equipment is

STARKS EYES widen with alarm as BECKER reaches for the
in his arm lingering on it long enough that Starks
braces

himself for an ATTACK of some sort But Becker just
looks

back innocently as he adjusts it

BECKER
Relax

STARKS
Dont act like I dont know whats
real Beat Im not the one thats
crazy here

BECKER
Pointedly Of course youre not

Then he clarifies wryly enough for Starks to catch it

BECKER
Youre just suffering from delusions
that are unfortunately part of your
condition

STARKS
Dont give me that I know whats
real goddamnit You strapped me in
something and stuck me in a drawer

BECKER nods diagnostically The NURSEs nonchalance
about it

as she LEAVES the room further disquiets STARKS
light

listening

BECKER sits

STARKS
I didnt dream it I may have been
asleep but it wasnt a dream
down in a CHAIR half-shrouded in the

BECKER
I had a patient a few years ago His
name was Ted Casey

STARKS
I dont give a shit about your
patient

BECKER
I wasnt pausing to see if you did
Beat But incidentally you should
because youre birds of a feather

STARKS squints as he searches out Beckers face

BECKER
Ted raped and sodomized a seven-year
old girl Beat His lawyers asked me
to have a look at him because after
his deeds were done he climbed
into the trees of the forest where he
killed her and woofed like a dog He
couldnt even remember his name when
I spoke to him but curiously
enough he could speak back Beat
Ted never went to prison because
everyone -- including me -- was
convinced he was sick So he came
here

BECKER leans into Starks view to make sure hes

STARKS is

BECKER
Then one day a little girl came with
her mother to visit a relative and I
caught Ted stealing looks at her --
the kind you really have to steal if
you know what I mean Beat I asked
Ted then if he could remember what
the little girl who he had slain
was wearing Beat He gave me a
look Ill never forget and when he
answered it wasnt with a color or
any sort of physical description Id
expect Oh yes he said I remember
it I remember it well Beat Those
were actually his last words I think

BECKERs expression bears a hunting mixture of anger
and

remorse as he recounts Teds tale

STARKS
We are not birds of a feather

BECKER
Maybe not Beat But I do think
youre in a tree woofing like a

dog And Im just trying to help you
the only way I can think of

Everything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad
mechanics of managing madness CATATONIC PATIENTS and

equipment litter the hall and as we follow a NURSE who
among them we spot STARKS -- ARMS suspended in air and

EYES fixed on the ceiling -- pretending to be one of

His ARMS fall and he wipes his dried MOUTH as soon as

lets his posture collapse as he despondently hangs
down so low they cant see his face They pass and

starts scuttling towards the door to the outside

As soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold --
only his BLUE PATIENT UNIFORM -- Starks walks normally
he no longer remembers the risks Instead he remembers

Howd he die

JACKIE 0S
I dont know But he did die

EXT GROUNDS ALPINE GROVE

STARKS leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold --
lifts some snow to his mouth TASTING it like a man who
to affirm he is still alive Hes so rapt that

VOICE takes him by surprise

LORENSON
Hey Youre not supposed to be out
here
where

on his

STARKS

out and

STARKS stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place
his body was found The terrible question asks itself
face Is this when Starks is killed

STARKS Turning around sharply
What are you going to do to me

LORENSON
Well
As LORENSON reaches into his POCKET for something
anxiously holds his breath Its BLACK when it comes

a SKI HAT when it opens up STARKS lets out his breath
relieved

LORENSON Nonchalantly
I thought Id just ask you to come
back inside with me

STARKS
And if I didnt want to come

LORENSON
I guess Id ask you why

STARKS
Because I dont think Im crazy

LORENSON
Youre not crazy
STARKS is surprised by Lorensons agreement

LORENSON
You suffer from delusional disorder
That doesnt mean youre crazy It

just means youre confused And
youre here instead of in jail
because that was determined to have
played a role in your killing of a
police officer

STARKS Correcting him
Alleged killing of a police officer

LORENSON
You were convicted of the crime

STARKS
That conviction doesnt convince me
of anything Until I know that I did
it Im not going to accept that I
did

LORENSON
You may never remember at all Beat
Your minds grasp of reality and the
real events that have happened to you
has been damaged

STARKS
No The real events that have
happened to me have been fucked up
Not my mind

LORENSON seems to realize -- at least for an instant --
that he

is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively and

cogently staring back at him

if he

Starks

LORENSON
Beat William Id like to ask you
something if I can

STARKS
Since when do people around here have
to ask permission to do anything

LORENSON Suspiciously
Hows your treatment progressing with
Dr Becker

STARKS still doesnt know how much Lorenson knows

should trust him

STARKS
Fine Beat Why made you ask
LORENSON answers first with his eyes looking over
body STARKS merely stares back tersely
LORENSON Carefully

I just hope youd let me know if that
wasnt the case

STARKS
Why what would you do

LORENSON
I could try tomake it stop

and
STARKS
No I dont want it to

LORENSON
So its helping
STARKS Choosing his words

carefully
Beat Its making me feel like a
different person
LORENSON -- sensing shes not going to get any more
from
Starks -- turns around to go back inside Its only as
she
turns her face away from STARKS that we see how nervous
she
is But youd never guess it from her tone

STARKS looks towards the FENCES locking him in from
every

I wasnt talking about anything

STARKS
Yeah you were What you said about
them taking me out to the woods

MACKENZIE clams up slightly at the mention of it

MACKENZIE
I know you need one when its really
cold

STARKS

Cutting in MacKenzie listen to me
Listen Im going to die

be familiar with It means youre
sane on some level

MACKENZIE grows visibly more nervous at this second

mention
of it

Oh no youre pretty young Your

of it than you think

STARKS
No Beat I mean I found out while I
was in it that my bodys gonna be
found in four days

Just then NURSE HARDING is upon them She carries a

ROD in
her hand which she TAPS menacingly on the floor as she

walks
towards them

HARDING
What are you two yappin about
STARKS tenses up as he sees only the ROD which could

inflict
a GASH if hit across a mans head the right way Nearly
every
object could be a threat to his life as this point

Beat Were talking about our
ability to go forward in time to go
into the future To Starks That is
what were talking about here right

Yeah it is

fucking freaks is what you are
STARKS Smiling
Well no shit Einstein What do you
think were doing in this place
MACKENZIE tries not to laugh but a CHUCKLE slips out
HARDING
I want the two of you to shut the
fuck up and eat your food
HARDING walks away with a final stare that Starks
returns

STARKS Under his breath
I gotta get back in it MacKenzie

MACKENZIE
Its gonna be sticky

STARKS
Why

MACKENZIEs body betrays his discomfort talking about
it in
its sudden jerks accompanying every word

MACKENZIE
Cause Lorensons got her claws in it
now When she started getting
suspicious about me was when they
stopped using it on me Women

STARKS
So what am I supposed to do

happen anyway Beat Just be careful
not to walk yourself right into

straight

threatening and disturbed As he is anxiously lookin
presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the
humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY Looking to see
comes from STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a
fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE SALLY
administering medication from a dated CART

STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO
or ORDERLIES around The YOUNG NURSE meanwhile is
on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her

The BRUTEs not that far away when he starts walking
the YOUNG NURSE STARKS starts in their direction

speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT
WALL She

picks up

strike

piece of GLASS

terrified

final time

STARKS
He lets

the BRUTE reaches the NURSE

He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the
starts screaming as he pushes up against her STARKS

the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it

The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain
balance Its clear hes impaired But its also clear

understands pain

STARKS To Sally

You ok
As she NODS her EYES dart above to the HAND about to
him Off her look he ducks and turns around punching
BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the
he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes
perilously close to STARKS head
The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS

s this when he dies

fq

The BRUTE -- incensed more than ever -- lunges at hima

STARKS gets him by the NECK expertly applying PRESSURE
POINTS and after only a few seconds subdues him

himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them
out a suspended BREATH instinctively touching his

to make sure hes not cut He looks back at SALLY
SALLY
Are you ok

STARKS
Yeah Why are you in this ward alone
Where is everyone

Theres a state rep visiting so
theyve moved everyone around But
Ive been alone before

In the therapy session downstairs
Thats what the reps sitting in
on

STARKS
Ok listen I want you to get out of

SALLY looks at STARKS wondering whether she can trust

him

Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she
remembers

that she can

presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS
enters

STARKS Calling out
Sorry Im late Dr Becker

BECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his
response

BECKER
Mr Starks this session is for our
civil patients Damon please take
Mr Starks back to his ward
STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze

STARKS Derisively
No Please Dr Becker You can strap
me in a Jacket or even gag me but
please dont leave me out of therapy
This is where I feel like I make the
most progress

BECKER relents seeing STARKS has the upper hand -- an
AUDIENCE deranged but eager no less

BECKER
Fine Mr Starks You can pull up a
chair for yourself

As STARKS walks across the room its obvious to
everyone -- as

they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a
physically

ailing man Using all his strength he walks up slowly
to the

group dragging a CHAIR behind him because he doesnt
have
hes

STARKS is

the strength to lift it STARKS sits down

BECKER
Mr Jensen please continue

JENSEN -- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group
seriously determining whether its safe to say what

about to

Well beat Ive been approached by
the Federal Trade Organization

BECKERs not listening to a word JENSEN says But

BECKER Calm as ever
And what have they approached you
about Mr Jensen

JENSEN
They want me to head the Organization
for the Organized

The other PATIENTS look at him in wonder as the STATE

listens limply

BECKER

JENSEN
Thats right Have you heard of them

BECKER
No Mr Jensen I have not

GROUP PATIENT 2
Thats because there is no such
Organization you idiot

JENSEN
That is categorically not true Bl-bl-
blatantly and manifestly NOT TRUE
Ive been asked to lead them But if
youd heard of them then they
wouldnt be hush-hush would they

STARKS Loud and emphatic
Well beat I know they exist

BECKER
And how is that

STARKS looks at JENSEN who looks back avidly
MACKENZIE eyes

Starks nervously like he senses what he is about to
do

STARKS
When I was in the Gulf the

Organized

BECKER Incensed
Is that a fact Mr Starks Because
if its not it doesnt help Mr
Jensen

STARKS Looking right at Jensen
It is a fact Bona fide and
classified

LORENSON and MACKENZIE watch STARKS curiously

JENSEN
I knew it I knew it Those little
fuckers are everywhere

STARKS
They recruit only the best Mr
Jensen Beat I didnt want to have
to say this

Not even the DOCTORS dare disrupt the silence

STARKS
But these people pointing to the

Presidents of this country and heads
of state leave office they come
here to Alpine Grove Theyre among
us right now Looking right at
Becker Isnt that right Dr
Thatcher And Jensen Im proud they
picked you

JENSEN looks on nobly

STARKS
Theyre always ordering us to stay
calm but how can we be calm

STARKS suddenly turns right at Becker wrapping his
message

to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut

STARKS
Looking suddenly directly at Becker
All they do is give orders Thats
all they have to do And no one will
ever know All it comes down to is an
order Beat Theyve got hands
everywhere

look to BECKER for order

INT DINER SMALL TOWN VERMONT 2004
STARKS enters the diner calming down even more as he

spots
JACKIE She looks up holding PLATES in her hand Shes
understandably surprised and unexpectedly pleased when
she
sees him She greets him with a small smile
She drops off her orders and then walks up to him
JACKIE
Ill be off in 15 minutes Can you
wait till then
EXT RAVINE VERMONT DAY 2004
STARKS and JACKIE smoke in the cold standing next to
the

hood of her car

JACKIE
The Jacket Thats what they call it
right
STARKS
Yeah
JACKIE
It was banned you know and it led

to an investigation of Dr Beckers
mistreatment of some of his patients
Thats when they found out how badly
he was drugging his patients

STARKS Starting to make sense
So he was giving me all kinds of
drugs

JACKIE nods

JACKIE Nodding
Apparently He was taking a lot of
them too It said he was trying out
behavior modification treatments that
were banned back in the 70s -- womb
treatment is the name he gave to
what he did to you

STARKS Cutting in
Womb A fuckin womb What kind of
animal did he come out of

JACKIE
But no one knew until after

STARKS
After I

JACKIE
Beat You bled to death

STARKS
What

JACKIE
I dont know how you got the cut to
your head but you died bleeding from
it

STARKS Digesting
And youre sure my body was found on
January 1st
sobriety

close

JACKIE nods

STARKS
Do you really believe me

JACKIE
I dont know Beat I thought I was
crazy after you left that day I died
I still think I could be crazy But
then I replayed that night in my head --
the parts of it I could remember --
and it was likeI dont care if I
was or am I havent felt that way
in a room with someone my whole life
Beat And when you left all I
wanted was

JACKIE looks around her coupled with the cold her

is obvious

STARKS takes hold of her and holds her face

to his so that their foreheads touch

JACKIE
Softly I want to trust you Should
I trust you

STARKS
Yes

JACKIE
Then we need to figure out what
happened to you Its the only thing
we can do

STARKS
I know

STARKS

JACKIE
Alpine Grove still exists I looked
it up on the net We should go there
and see if theres still anyone
around who might have known what
happened to you

STARKS
If they dont take me out before
then As an afterthought Whats the
net

JACKIE looks at him and laughs

INT JACKIES CAR 2004 DAY

They are driving through VERMONT to ALPINE GROVE

looks out the window and watches her drive

STARKS
I didnt kill Officer Harrison

JACKIE
I know

STARKS
How Did they figure it out after I
died

JACKIE
young

matching

No They never figured it out I did
Most murderers dont stop to help a
drunk woman and her little girl on
the side of the road Not without
hurting them

INT ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE ALPINE GROVE 2004

STARKS and JACKIE sit opposite DR MORGAN the curre
face of the hospital MORGAN has a boyish face and a

gullibility

DR MORGAN
Im sorry I cant tell you more about
your fathers death Mr Starks Our
own medical examiners determined only
that he died from a blunt trauma to
the head but that was right around
the time the Alpine Groves staff
changed and Im afraid we didnt have
the best record system before then

STARKS
His body was found on January 1
1993 but do you know if that was
long after he had died

DR MORGAN
No I dont Im sorry I wish I knew
more

STARKS

What about Dr Thomas Becker or Dr
Loel Lorenson There was also a Dr

nt

Gries I think

DR MORGAN
Well Dr Lorenson is still here at
the hospital If she was here at the
time your father was then Im sure
shed be of more help to you

STARKS
What about Dr Becker and Mr Gries

DR MORGAN
Unfortunately Im not familiar with
Dr Becker and Dr Gries passed away
three four years ago

JACKIE
Do you have any kind of forwarding
address for Dr Becker

DR MORGAN
Your father was here 12 years ago I
doubt the hospital would have that
if Dr Becker is still even alive
Beat a little suspiciously Is
there a particular reason you need
to know how your father died

STARKS doesnt waver when he answers

STARKS
He was the only family I remember

DR MORGAN Nodding
Ill see what I can find out about
Dr Becker And maybe Dr Lorenson
will know something

STARKS

now than

to

they
LORENSON

and the

Starks
unfamiliar

Lorenson

INT WARD ALPINE GROVE DAY 2004

Dr MORGAN leads JACKIE and STARKS through a ward
looks around in disbelief its more like a hospital

it ever was in 1993

INT RECEPTION AREA LORENSONS OFFICE ALPINE GROVE

As they arrive outside Lorensons office MORGAN turns

them

DR MORGAN
Let me just tell her were here
DR MORGAN goes inside and JACKIE takes STARKS HAND as
wait Its hardly more than a couple seconds when
appears in the doorway She looks at STARKS curiously

two share a very lengthy intense STARE

DR LORENSON -- now in her 50s -- walks closer to
suspiciously For his part STARKS doesnt look as

with Lorenson as he should this doesnt escape
LORENSON
Hello Im Beth Lorenson

She puts out a hand that is trembling slightly

LORENSON
Its nice to meet you Mr Starks

STARKS hesitates before he takes Lorensons hand There

is
something very eerie about the exchange STARKS quickly
lets
go and LORENSON turns to JACKIE
LORENSON
And you are
JACKIE looks back uncomfortably
JACKIE
Im just Williams friend
LORENSON looks over both of them acutely and then
calmly
turns to Dr Morgan
LORENSON
I think well be fine from here
Thanks Stanley

INT LORENSONS OFFICE ALPINE GROVE 2004
LORENSON leans against her desk while STARKS and JACKIE

sit
in the chairs As they talk each seems cautious in his
exchange -- not knowing what the other one does or
doesnt
know
LORENSON

My God you look exactly like him

STARKS
I never knew my father Did you

LORENSON
Yeah I did Beat He was my most
memorable patient

STARKS
Why

LORENSON considers her answer

LORENSON
At the end he made me change my mind
about a lot of things

STARKS
You thought my father was crazy

LORENSON
No I dont think he was crazy He
needed helpbut he wasnt crazy
Beat Your father actually helped me
with a case of mine

LORENSON waits to see if STARKS knows what she is
talking

about

STARKS
What case

LORENSON
I was working with a boy named
Eugene

STARKS shows no recognition but JACKIE does

JACKIE
Who was Eugene

LORENSON Peaked
He was a friends son Beat Are you
familiar with the case

JACKIE
Just a little when we were looking
up information about Williams
father How did he help

LORENSON
Its complicated but looking at
Starks in a way your father let me
know how Id get through to him

JACKIE
How
LORENSON
He just saidthat Id shock Eugene
and then things would change for him

JACKIE
I dont understand

LORENSON
I still dont either even after all
these years

STARKS
Do you know how my father died

LORENSON Unconvincingly
I dont know how much I remember but
I seem to think it was from a cut or
blow of some sort or another

STARKS
Howd he get it

LORENSON
Beat I dont know

STARKS
But Dr Morgan said you were around
when my father was

LORENSON
I was But I saw a lot of cuts anda
lot of blows Im sorry I dont know
more about your fathers Sincerely
I didnt know about everything that
went on here

LORENSON says it like shes hiding something

STARKS
Well do you think Dr Becker would
have any idea

LORENSON
How do you know about Dr Becker

STARKS
My dad wrote some things down before
he died

LORENSON looks like shes suddenly remembering

something
LORENSON
Thats right He did
STARKS looks at Lorenson curiously he doesnt know
what

Lorenson is talking about

LORENSON
So maybe Dr Becker would know
Beat But as Im sure you know the
statute of limitations has run out
for charging the hospital with any
liabilities

STARKS
Why would we do that
STARKS just stares at LORENSON not knowing if he died
by

this mans hands or not not knowing who he can
trust

JACKIE
Because Becker resigned after the
charges brought against him by State
Patient Advocacy Groups

LORENSON
I see youve done your homework
Beat Alpine Groves undergone a lot
of changes since then At the time
we didnt have theresources to
help our patients the way we needed
to Beat Now we do And things are
different

STARKS
I wouldnt be so sure Like you said
about back then you might not know
everything going on around here

DR LORENSON looks right at STARKS

LORENSON
Its important for you to know who
your father was isnt it

STARKS
Beat Yeah it is

LORENSON Eerily
Its almost as if your life depended
on it Isnt it
Lorensons

STARKS
Exactly

LORENSON
Well beat let me know how your
search turns out

STARKS
Beat We will

INT HALLWAY ALPINE GROVE DAY

STARKS and JACKIE walk briskly down it

office

STARKS
I dont believe a thing she just
said

JACKIE
Me neither Who was the boy she was
talking about Eugene

STARKS
I have no idea

JACKIE
You think Lorenson kills you

STARKS
Maybe I dont know Seems more
likely Becker does but at the very
least she knows how I died

away from
JACKIE
Lets see if they have an address for
Becker I also want to figure out
more about the kid you helped her
with

STARKS
Why

JACKIE
Because thats the part I believe is
true You probably did help her
somehow with the boy and Eugenes
name did come up over and over again
on the abstracts I pulled

STARKS nods

STARKS
Beat Theres one more thing I want
to see

INT CORRIDOR LEADING TO BASEMENT ALPINE GROVE 2004

STARKS determined now leads JACKIE As they reach the
end

of the hall we see DAMON -- now in his 50s -- look
after them

curiously before he goes back to his work with a
PATIENT
INT BASEMENT ALPINE GROVE 2004

JACKIE watches STARKS ignore the Authorized Personnel
Only

SIGN as he pushes the door open without so much as a
pause

INT MORGUE BASEMENT ALPINE GROVE 2004

The morgue looks exactly as before

STARKS is momentarily jarred in the room He looks to
the

wall on which the JACKET hung and sees only the BARE
HOOKS

that used to hold it up

STARKS
This was the room They used to hang
the Jacket there Turning to Jackie
This is where it happened This is
the room Im actually in right now

JACKIE isnt doubtful but its also hard to be
convinced

STARKS
I can show you Its probably in
there

STARKS walks to the CADAVER DRAWERS and rests his hands
on

the one they put him in Then with great difficulty --

physical and emotional -- he opens it to see if there
is

anything left

He pulls it out and theres nothing in there

the
BLOOD --

into when

spots

DAMON

JACKIE
Maybe this wasnt such a good idea
STARKS leans closer locating all the proof he needs
stained metal -- still reddened and browned with DRIED
and the part of the morgue slab he CLAWED his NAILS

he was in it JACKIE looks at it in disbelief

STARKS
Yes it was Softly My fingers were
the only things I could move Beat
Dead bodies dont bleed And they
certainly cant claw so hard they
dent metal

INT HALLWAY BASEMENT ALPINE GROVE
STARKS and JACKIE are leaving the MORGUE when STARKS
DAMON now hardly a hair of the bully he was before

stares at him curiously STARKS glares back furiously

DAMON
You folks aint supposed to be down
here

JACKIE

We were just leaving

DAMON doesnt take his eyes off Starks
DAMON
Do I know you from somewhere

STARKS
You may have known my father William
Starks
DAMON smiles remembering

DAMON
Thats right Goddamn youre the
spitting image I didnt know he had
a son

STARKS
He didnt either

DAMON With a dirty laugh
Ill be damned He musta been 12 when
he had you Beat You could be his
ghost

STARKS
Did you know my father

DAMON
Oh yeah sure He killed a cop
right

STARKS looms strangely over DAMON in this exchange
he

STARKS
You wouldnt happen to know how he
died would you

DAMON Slightly apprehensive
No I dont I just remember them
finding his body

STARKS
You dont know any more Damon

DAMON Shocked
Howd you know my name

STARKS
My father used to talk about you

DAMON
Oh yeah whatd he say

Damons eyes betray his unease

STARKS
He said you were a sadistic fuck that
belonged in jail

DAMON is shocked and cowed So much that he shakes as

looks for his bearings

DAMON
Look here I dont like you getting
in my face and saying this bullshit
to me

STARKS
Thats too bad

and

craven

remembers

DAMON
I thought you said you never knew
your father

STARKS
I didnt Beat Did you have
anything to do with his death

DAMON
I dont know what youre talking
about man I swear This is some
weird shit youre telling me and I
dont know how come youre doing it

STARKS starts to see a shaking man who stands confused

distraught before him

STARKS
He died because he bled to death from
a blow to his head Someone had to
have given him it

DAMON
I never touched your father I swear
Damons eyes are filled with dishonesty tears and a

FEAR STARKS leans in closer to DAMON as he

STARKS
You know something Damon Youre
like a mule Youre real stubborn
But theres ways of fixin that All
you need is a good stick Beat
Heres your stick Live with it

STARKS looks like he could easily bash Damons head

against
the wall but instead he lets it go and walks away

How far away is that

STARKS lifts her higher so he can look at her as they
make

love for the first time

INT BEDROOM JACKIES APARTMENT NIGHT

JACKIE is lying in STARKS arms running her FINGERS
over one
of the SCARS on his chest STARKS strokes her hair

JACKIE
What about Captain Medley He never
told them what happened to you over
there His testimonythat coward
wanted them to think you were crazy

STARKS
I know It was perfect Beat Erase
my sanity and you erase anything Ill
ever say

JACKIE Frustrated
Well doesnt what he did to you make
you mad
STARKS
Of course it makes me mad It makes
me more than mad Just like
remembering the face of the man who
killed that officer and knowing
nothing more about him But whats it
gonna do for me to find them now I
cant fix everything in three days

JACKIE
Youve got to get yourself out of
that place Theyre going to kill you
if you dont

STARKS
I might not be able to

JACKIE
Its not a prison its a hospital
Theres got to be some way out of
there and youve got to find it

awakening her as if she heard it in her sleep She
across the bed but STARKS is no longer there She runs

hands over the bed like hes alive in the sheets

INT HALLWAY ALPINE GROVE NIGHT 1992

DR LORENSON is administering medicine to a patient in
ward when she sees -- almost like a shadow -- a
being wheeled down the hall She finishes with the

and runs to the end of the hall in search of it

INT STARKS ROOM ICU ALPINE GROVE LATE NIGHT 1992

STARKS lies recovering under a small light above his
bed His body bears marks of the brutalization As we
back we see DR LORENSON standing guard over him at

of his bed

EXT WARD ICU ALPINE GROVE NEXT MORNING

STARKS sits by a window -- IVs in his arm -- smoking

still severely weak from the Jacket while DR LORENSON
observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes

LORENSON
Youll die if you keep smoking those
in your condition
STARKS
Ill die either way

LORENSON pulls up a chair and sits opposite him

LORENSON
I cant try to help you unless you
let me Beat I know about the
Jacket

STARKS waits to see what this means

LORENSON
Im sorry for what you were put
through and Im sorry I couldnt
stop it earlier But I promise you
that I will from now on

STARKS Cutting him off
I dont want you to

LORENSON doesnt understand

LORENSON
What do you mean

STARKS
You have no idea whats going on

LORENSON
No I do Thats what Im saying to
he

you

STARKS
Listen to me You dont The Jacket
is my only chance in this place

LORENSON just thinks its another delusion

LORENSON
How can you say that in your physical
condition Do you realize that its
because you were put in it that

youre asweak as you are now
Beckers a man whos not well
himself

STARKS searches for words that wont sound as crazy as

knows he appears They dont exist

STARKS
You dont understand

LORENSON
Then help me understand You know
youre not alone A lot of Gulf Vets
have begun to experience curious
symptoms What you have might well be
a syndrome and if so its not one
we know enough about to be treating
it this vigorously

STARKS
This has nothing to do with that

LORENSON Exasperated
Then what What Beat I cant guess
it You have to help me
STARKS fixes his eyes on Lorenson He has nothing to

lose but
still he treads carefully The words that follow come
almost
unwittingly
STARKS
What you do not know is the only
thing you know
(MORE)

STARKS (contd)
Beat And what you own is what you
do not own
And where you are is where you are
not
LORENSON
Beat Where is that from
Its as though STARKS hears his words for the first
time

STARKS
I dont know Frustrated Remember

LORENSON
Come on Tell me what you do know

STARKS
Beat Ive seen a time thats not
this time And Im only able to see
it when Im in the Jacket
LORENSON
Well what time is it

STARKS

LORENSON nods trying to mask his dismay but failing

STARKS
You dont believe me

LORENSON Testing him
Well what year do you think it is
now

STARKS Exasperated
Im not delusional I know its 1992
Same as every sane person

LORENSON
Ok fine Tell me about it Tell me
about the future 2004 What does it
look like

STARKS
It doesnt look all that different

LORENSON
The future doesnt look different

STARKS
No Not for people like me Beat
Not in the places I come from

LORENSON
What about the world

STARKS
I didnt see that much of it -- same
as now I only saw it as part of my
own life

LORENSON looks at STARKS unintentionally patronizing

LORENSON
Do you think youre traveling in
time Is that it

STARKS shakes his head and momentarily challenges
Lorenson
simply with his air of calm resolve

STARKS
Not everyone in here is crazy Doc

LORENSON searches for another approach

LORENSON
Beat Like who Like MacKenzie
maybe

STARKS
Maybe

LORENSON Matter-of-factly
Did he tell you he tried to kill his
wife
almost

it and

STARKS nods

LORENSON
MacKenzie locked himself up in his
house for two months and nearly
starved himself to death before he
was brought here All because his
wife left him for another man

STARKS moves to put his cigarette out and his IV
falls out of his arm LORENSON makes a move to adjust

STARKS flinches perceptibly startling LORENSON

STARKS Adjusting it himself
Maybe that just makes him weak not
crazy Or maybe he is crazy Beat
Still doesnt make me think I am

(MORE)

STARKS Adjusting it himself
And judging by the fact that you
just told me about another patient
it doesnt even make you think I am
so what dont you work on persuading
yourself first

LORENSON
Why dont you help me

STARKS
Because I dont have time

LORENSON
Why not

STARKS
Im about to die unless I do
something to stop it

LORENSON
And how do you know that

STARKS
Because of the future I know whats
going to happen

LORENSON
William that is just another facet
of my delusions

Then STARKS remembers the only thing that might help

him He
pauses trying to recall as much of it as he can
STARKS
And what about your work with Eugene --
the kid Is that another facet of my
delusions
LORENSON -- having prepared to continue -- is bowled
over at
the mention of her patient She loses all color and
calm in

her features

LORENSON
How do you know about Eugene

STARKS

disbelief

You told me about him I saw you and
I think you thought I knew something
about him So you told me

LORENSON doesnt know what to say

LORENSON Somewhat angrily
How do you know about Eugene

STARKS Shaking his head in

You told me Its like two parts of
you talking through me Look judging
from your reaction theres no other
way I could know about him

LORENSON
There obviously is so what dont you
just tell me how you found out about
him

STARKS looks at her convincingly

STARKS
Some part of you suspects -- even if
you dont know for sure -- that what

Im saying is true

LORENSON
I dont know how you know about
Eugene but these ideas are part of
your delusions

STARKS
NO Theyre not my delusions Look
fearful

the

-- all

taps

just leave my business with Becker to
me

LORENSON
One things got nothing to do with
the other

STARKS
Ones got everything to do with the
other So unless you want my blood on
your handsleave whats between me
and Becker between me and Becker

LORENSON backs off jarred by Starks assertions and

of his debilitating vehemence

INT HALLWAY ALPINE GROVE DAY 1992

MACKENZIE sits idly on one of the hallway benches until

hallway is clear of the STAFF Then he scuttles quickly

the time close to the wall -- to Starks room

INT STARKS ROOM ALPINE GROVE DAY 1992

MACKENZIE gets inside ducks as a NURSE passes and then

lightly on the wall announcing himself gladly

MACKENZIE
Hey I brought you some smokes

STARKS doesnt waste any time

STARKS
Lorenson said your wife left you for
another man and thats when you lost

it
MACKENZIE almost imperceptibly winces -- confirming the
truth
for Starks -- before he has to sit down
MACKENZIE
Geez hows that for a fucking thank
you
STARKS
Is it true
MACKENZIE tosses him the CIGARETTES and lights himself
one
MACKENZIE
She left me I tried to kill her I
tried to kill myself She was mean I
was weak I was cruel so she left I
didnt plan it didnt see itFINE
MACKENZIE suddenly stops distraught When he resumes
its
in an oddly more normal tone than hes ever used
before

MACKENZIE Softly
I didnt want to see it Im in here
because they say I have a nervous
condition Beat Well heres my
question who wouldnt be nervous if
they really looked at their life
Beat Whose life is that good
hurt

STARKS doesnt have an answer

MACKENZIE
Not this luckless little mammals
What difference is it to them Beat
slows down You believe what you want
to believe One version is easier
than another so you make it your own

As MacKenzie runs his hand over his forehead he looks

and sad but strangely not a bit crazy

MACKENZIE
Ill tell you this though However
nuts I am I wasnt nuts enough not
to know how wrong it was to put a
human being in something like that

MACKENZIEs twitching continues as he recollects it

STARKS
MacKenzie beat what if we are
crazy

MACKENZIE

Shrugging What if we are Therere
crazier things than thinking up
fictions for yourself Beat
Everyone does it dont they Even
Becker That roller coaster car pops
more pills than all of Ward 3
STARKS
Becker does Are you sure

MACKENZIE
Ive been here for 11 years Its my
neighborhood Course Im sure Hes
as drugged up as the rest of usI
guess he has to be to put up with all
this

STARKS nods and MacKenzie puts his head down suddenly
vulnerable and embarrassed STARKS lights TWO

CIGARETTES
STARKS
Thanks for the cigarettes You
still got a lot of problems
MacKenzie but youre ok
MACKENZIE and STARKS smoke together quietly
INT STARKS ROOM ALPINE GROVE DECEMBER 29th 1992
STARKS is trying to see if the windows open through the
bars

covering them Its especially hard with the IV still
connected to one of his arms

BECKER
At least its some kind of bars weve
got you behind

STARKS turns startled

BECKER
Hello William I understand youve
been asking for me almost every hour
I wouldve been here sooner but you
gave our little state visitor quite a
bit to talk to me about

STARKS
Thats too bad

BECKER
It is But when it comes down to it
you just have to patient with them
Theyd rather have their vacation
too so they just push dealing with
our practices off to the New Year

STARKS
They make it hard for you to get away
with your business huh

BECKER
Temporarily

STARKS lights a cigarette and with that gesture
adopts the

unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears

little resemblance to his usual demeanor

STARKS
Makes it a little easier for me to
get away with mine

BECKER looks at STARKS seriously

BECKER
And whats that

STARKS
My business

BECKER
Yes

STARKS
Getting away with things Like
whatever I may or may not have gotten
away with Officer Harrison

BECKER
You killed him

STARKS simply delivers one slow nod

STARKS
And wound up in a better cage Beat
But I still want to make a deal
BECKER looks understandably disgusted and STARKS
proceeds

with the calculation of someone who is guilty

STARKS
See the deluxe lab animal treatment
Ive been receiving -- well I dont
think its worked I woke up today
and realized eerily lowering his
voice I dont think Im cured So
really what was the point Torture
I think thats still sort of illegal
in some states -- though well have to
check on Vermont And hows this for
the cherry on top it seems my
physician is a pill-popping freak
slowly
him
prepared

when

arm

Beat Last time I checked that
makes some pretty good copy for a lot
of these news shows Humbly deftly
I dont remember everything they did
to me I just remember the worst
parts I think I should be sitting
down when I say it dont you think

It takes BECKER some seconds to swallow this

BECKER
I thinkI have to think about it
BECKER cocks his head to one side as he does Then he
makes his way over to STARKS and leans in closer to
STARKS instinctively raises his hand to his HEAD --
to be defensive if he has to be If this is the moment

hes killed

But BECKER only YANKS the IV angrily out of Starks

tearing his skin with it

BECKER
I think your story needs a little
fleshing out before its ready to go

BECKER turns to leave as STARKS bleeds onto the floor

BECKER
Ill say a prayer for you in Church
today Starks Maybe the Gods can
pick up where the medicine left off
STARKS
You sure you know where to find one

BECKER
Ive managed to every Sunday of my
life Beat Some of us are God-
fearing men Starks

STARKS
And what does that mean

BECKER
Means we believe in doing his work
and fear what the world would be like
if we didnt at least try to

STARKS smirks at the hypocrisy he sees

STARKS
Becker how do you sleep at night

BECKER
You in here Beat Works like a
drug

BECKER leaves without looking back and STARKS closes
his
eyes breathing a sigh of relief that its over

EUGENE sits opposite LORENSON who quietly observes
jotting some notes down on her pad She is
holding up PICTURES for Eugene asking him to repeat
names as if she were teaching him to read

LORENSON

Eugene this is a TRAIN

EUGENE starts to pronounce the word when abruptly and
without any warning he looks like hes unconscious
with a blank stare Lorenson quickly moves beside
watches him from up close apparently not altogether
surprised at whats happening
EUGENE doesnt even blink The only sounds we hear from
are a couple barely audible guttural noises LORENSON

exhausted -- takes off her glasses wearily and gently
addresses the boy

LORENSON
Come on back down here Wherever you
aretry to come on back Youll

Just then TALIA walks in with TEA JUICE and COOKIES
Eugene and Lorenson She spots her son in his absent

state and forces her face into a small sad smile to

tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before

JACKIE and STARKS watch as the people file out of

They are leaning against her car when STARKS spots him
DR BECKER walks beside a SMALL CHILD -- presumably his
GRANDSON JACKIE registers his formidableness with some
surprise Beckers maintained a strong physique and is

a shade less intimidating than he was before Only his

has a permanent shake now

STARKS doesnt waste any time He heads straight for
Almost sensing him BECKER looks in his direction The

look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of

STARKS
You still go to Church Hows that
work Your God just doesnt notice
That it Beat serious How you
doin Dr Becker

BECKER stops walking and looks at Starks His GRANDSON

at him

BECKERS GRANDSON
Grandpa
BECKER Still looking at Starks
Sean why dont you wait for me by
the car Ill be there in a minute
Turning to the kid Ok

His grandson momentarily appeased heads for the car

BECKER To Starks
Can I help you

STARKS

I dont know Dr Becker Can you

Thats enough to confirm for BECKER who STARKS is

All around them people leaving Church socialize
routinely --
unaware of the haunted history being made between them

BECKER
Who are you

STARKS
I think you know Your eyes say you
do

BECKER

Beat Youre his son

STARKS
No Im not his son Im him Beat
What You look like youve seen a
ghost You can come here and touch
me old man Im the real thing

BECKER
Howhow are you here

STARKS looks at Becker -- each a terrifying reminder of
the
others past

BECKER
You died Starks Years ago in the
hospital

STARKS
I know Beat You killed me didnt
you

BECKER

No I didnt I swear I didnt I
probably helped push you to kill
yourself but I didnt do it

STARKS
I didnt kill myself I died from a
blow to the head Howd it happen I
have to know

BECKER looks at him nearly too stunned to speak

BECKER
I dont know how you died The last
time I put you in the Jacket was just
after you told me you remembered
killing that police officer

STARKS
I didnt say I remembered killing
him I just repeated some words to
get myself back in there

BECKER
I know Beat I knew that when you
came out

STARKS
How

BECKER
Becausebecause you came out and
said something you couldnt have
possibly have known You came back
and repeated three names

BECKER falters as he recalls his offenses

BECKER
Of people like you People I was just
trying to help They couldnt get
worse so I thought with medication
they might get

STARKS
Medication What kind of meds do you
chase with nights in a cadaver
drawer

BECKER
It was part of the treatment I
intendedI didnt know what the
effects would be

STARKS
So what you guinea pig sick people
to find out

BECKER
The three of you werent regular
patients You were criminals that
ended up at Alpine Grove

STARKS
No we were patients

BECKER concedes after all this time

BECKER
You and the others didnt seem that
way then

STARKS is quiet as he comes to understand how its
about to

work out if Becker tells him those names now he
essentially

indicts himself

STARKS
Who were the others

BECKER remembers with a hint of remorse

BECKER Racked with remorse
Nathan Piechowski Jackson
MacGregor and Ted Casey Beat I
didnt ask for you -- for any of
you You were all sent to me

STARKS looks at Becker in astonishment
BECKER

What is it

STARKS just stares at Becker waiting for the
realization to
hit him too

BECKER
How did you come to know their
names

STARKS

You just told me The last time I
was with you was when I was in the
Jacket Im in it right now Dr
Becker

BECKER
I dont understand

STARKS
Im in it as we speak Beat Youre
haunting yourself right now Beat
I guess sometimes we indict
ourselves if no one else does You
didnt make history like you wanted
to huh Dr Becker It turned out
different didnt it

BECKER
I didnt put you in Alpine Grove
STARKS
No Beat You put me on drugs and
then you put me in the Jacket

BECKER Stoically
I was sorry when I heard you died
I was buthow was I to know you
didnt shoot that police officer

STARKS
The same way you just said I didnt
without my ever telling you Beat
And that still doesnt excuse what
you did Just because you had keys
to a cage didnt mean you had
animals inside Beat Youve
earned your guilt Becker

STARKS shares a last look with Becker before he walks
away
towards the car

What How can you say that Hes
the one that put you in that

And with those words JACKIE starts to break down

STARKS
No ones killing anyone

STARKS takes her hand and runs it over his head

STARKS
Touch me Im okay

STARKS looks at her with love understanding and for

the

first time a sense of peace He strokes her hair to
calm her

down

If everything hadnt happened the

STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and
it as best as he can The sound however is still
understandably soft
STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door
opens it and looks inside We first see his face and

devastation on it as we guess the sight hes laid eyes

JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table still only 7

old Though STARKS expected it he falters under the
disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the

he loved As she looks up at him its all he can do

break down

STARKS
Hi
JACKIE Surprised
Hey Beat I remember you

STARKS
I remember you too

STARKS shakes his head looking at her She looks

beautiful

and still hopeful Her life lays ahead of her and her
fate --

when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as
possible

from this innocent still promising image

STARKS
Jackie how have you been

better state than we saw her before

Hey Jean Nice to see you

JEAN looks a little confused

JEAN
Im sorry Your face looks awfully
familiar I just cant quite place
it

JACKIE
Mom this is the guy that drove us
home that afternoon we were stuck
on the highway The guy you yelled
at for no good reason
Oh yeah

She gives him a once over and seeing how weakened he
looks
decides intuitively he cant be much harm She also
notices
LORENSON waiting by the car
JEAN
There something you need
STARKS
You could say that
STARKS looks at JACKIE hesitating because of her
Sensing

this JEAN asks Jackie to leave

JEAN

EXT JACKIE AND JEANS HOUSE DAY 1992

As STARKS is walking away we see his eyes begin to
tear in

the cold -- but not from it

INT JACKIE AND JEANS HOUSE DAY 1992

JACKIE abruptly runs after him

JACKIE
Hey wait

STARKS stops in his tracks he clears as much sadness
from

his face as he can before he turns around to face her

STARKS
Beat You be good to yourself
Jackie

JACKIE
Ok

Then suddenly she sticks her hand for him to shake
as she

did that day on the roadside only now it trembles
slightly
in the cold
softly and
as

STARKS takes JACKIES HAND and holds it in his own
affectionately JEAN and DR LORENSON look on curiously
STARKS looks in her face at her hand in his and then

heavens for the means to get through this

As STARKS lets go at last JACKIE looks back at him

the connection even if she doesnt know it yet

STARKS turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car
LORENSON moves to help him but STARKS tells her not to

his eyes He makes his way to the car on his own

JEAN sits down and starts to open the LETTER Starks
as we hear it now is presumably from parts of the

hes written to her

INT LORENSONS CAR DUSK 1992

LORENSON looks over to STARKS who stares painfully out

window They drive on in silence
STARKS (VO)
I was 25 years old the first time I
died It didnt end anything though
Beat Sometimes I think we live
through things only to be able to
tell them to bear witness to say
this happened

INT ALPINE GROVE NEW YEARS EVE 1992
STARKS walks back through the gates of the hospital
despondently returning inside with LORENSON at his
side

STARKS (VO)
And it wasnt to someone else It
was to me And I lived despite it
Sometimes I think we live to beat
the odds And sometimes I agree
that life can only begin with the
knowledge of death That it can all
end even when you least want it
to

INT WARD ALPINE GROVE EVENING

MACKENZIE looks up from his game of solitaire as
LORENSON

helps STARKS down the hall He holds up his hand in the

gesture of hello or goodbye

STARKS raises his hand back with an earnest smile

STARKS
Im telling you my story because
its the only way I can try to help
your daughter and you have a
better one of your own

JEAN is reading each page avidly affected by this

JACKIE rummages in a box of her personal belongings
for something specific in them She stops finally when
finds STARKS DOG TAGS She takes them out slowly and

them around her neck

STARKS (VO)
I am not a crazy man even though
they mistook me for one I live in
the same world as the rest of you
Only I saw more of it

Then after a moment of staring down at them she tucks

under her sweater

CAPTAIN MEDLEY holds a beer as he stares blankly at a

Medleys barely watching the footage

Dr Lorenson helps Starks back to bed STARKS looks up

Lorenson thanking her without words but with his eyes
LORENSON smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks even

TWO PAIRS of legs walk down a corridor darkened by the
night through the now familiar passage to the

STARKS is not restrained this time though we dont see
walking down the hall with him He runs his hand over

forehead and looks at it when hes done STILL NO CUT

They slow down their pace as they round the corner as
appears dizzier and dizzier He doesnt stop and the

beside him doesnt see how weak he is until STARKS

In slow motion we hear a DISTANT GARBLED VOICE CALL

DISTORTED VOICE

No Waatch out

But STARKS head hits the GLASS CASE of the FIRE

PERSON leaning over him to see if hes all right

The details start to make sense even to Starks This

WOUND they said he died from

INT MORGUE BASEMENT ALPINE GROVE NEW YEARS EVE

STARKS collapses on the familiar slab ready to be
into the Jacket one final time BLOOD pours from his

onto the floor

The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks
onto the metal slab Shes doing it as carefully and
as she can -- taking observable care with every strap

JACKET almost as if the act itself is a humane one

When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck
the hardest part of the struggle has passed STARKS
kindly and thankfully into the single overhead LIGHT

room that obscures the face of the person strapping him

As the drawer is pushed in one of the STRAPS gets
the side CUTTING STARKS ARM We hear a small CRY in

the

room Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push
STARKS

in

INT JACKETTUNNEL

Its more beautiful and serene inside than its ever
been

before This time as he travels through the tunnel
its as

though hes traveling in a heaven of his own The
IMAGES he

sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a

tranquil fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has
finally

retrieved his memory without it haunting him

STARKS (VO)
I promise you Jean No matter how
bad the days and things around you
look they look better awake than
they do asleep I can offer you
some proof when you die theres
only one thing you want to have

missed a tragedy

FADE TO BLACK

EXT DINER SMALL TOWN VERMONT 2005

Over the sounds of CARS slushing in the snow an IMAGE
up slowly on the screen until we see its STARKS

in the parking lot outside the diner once more

This time he seems situated and hopeful After a
longer wait than the first time JACKIE walks out -- in
same way as before except that she wears a NURSES

and an unmistakable air of vitality

Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same
attraction between them teeming even more than before
as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel

with a
BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold
STARKS is
someone we see she wants to be near
Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does she looks beautiful
alive happy and just like the woman he never wanted to
leave She approaches Starks warmly less suspicious of
the
world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember
her
being
JACKIE
Hey there Beat You ok
STARKS revels in the moment In their reunion
STARKS
I think so
JACKIE
Youre bleeding pretty bad there
STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and seeing the
BLOOD
on his hands looks up at her terrified Sensing this
she

moves closer to calm him

Its ok Its ok Relax Its just
a cut We can get it fixed

STARKS can hardly keep his eyes off her when her CELL

PHONE
suddenly rings
JACKIE

JACKIE answers it smiling
JACKIE

STARKS listens nervously to her conversation and the
affection in her voice
JACKIE
Listen I gotta go mom â€˜cause Im

Ok bye

JACKIE hangs up and looks at Starks -- feeling a little
awkward after the call
JACKIE
Sorry about that It was my mom
STARKS smiles back warmly at her he gets it more than
she

knows

STARKS
Nothin to worry about there

EXT OVERHEAD VERMONT HIGHWAY 2005

Jackies car pulls onto the highway alongside the

other
more modern cars on the highway
JACKIE (0S)

The happy sound of their engine on the highway
continues
uninterrupted for some seconds before first faintly
then
louder we hear a racking all too familiar sound the

creaking as its opened once more
