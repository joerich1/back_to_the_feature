FADE IN

0n ROBERT HANSSEN eyes closed at prayer

INT CHAPEL - NOON 1
Hes on his knees clutching a rosary while silently mouthing
a Novena (Religion runs bone-deep with this man) Were in
SLOW-MOTION MOS

Ask people about him and the same words keep popping up
cold arrogant introverted awkward But youll also hear
brilliant well-read generous old-fashioned a mentor

We linger on his face in profile then he rises TRACK HIM
down the aisle of this gilded chapel to a pair of large
wooden doors He pushes them open revealing

INT CATHOLIC INFORMATION CENTER - CONTINUING (NOON) 2
A Catholic Reading Room boasting pamphlets tracts the
writings of the Pope copies of a tome called The Way
Were still in SLOW-MO as Hanssen glides through calmly

The STAFFERS here know him well they like him He nods to
the NUN at the Cash Register then opens two glass doors

and the real world hits us like a jackhammer

EXT 16TH STREET - WASHINGTON DC - NOON 3
Sounds suddenly assault us in REAL-TIME voices stereos
horns unnaturally loud A coin-op news-stand SLAMS SHUT

revealing a FLORIDA RECOUNT headline Its December 2000

Hanssen pauses his ears offended by all this noise He joins

the weather-bundled crowd vanishing down 16th Street

INT UNIDENTIFIED HOTEL ROOM - DAY 4

Were TIGHT on a TAPE RECORDER as a cassette spins inside

From it we hear the voice of Robert Hanssen

HANSSENS VOICE (ON CASSETTE)

He nods to them go to work They enter the conference room
INTERCUT WITHEXT GEORGETOWN ALLEY - NIGHT 6

Snow falls on a VAGRANT as he urinates against an alley wall
grimy clothes matted hair we can smell him from here
Beside him is a CART packed with junk He shivers mumbling

Across the street is an Ethiopian restaurant A LIBYAN MAN
and his WIFE emerge from it bickering The Vagrant turns

and with a minimum of movement extracts a CAMERA and a
huge LOW-LIGHT LENS from his tattered overcoat He squeezes

off 24 shots of the arquing Libyan Couple Just like that

Then he pockets the roll of film inserts another and gets
24 more shots until the Libyan Couple is gone

This vagrant is ERIC ONEILL 26 from the FBIs Special
Surveillances Group Smart cocky ambitious But baby-faced
He vanishes around a corner - like a ghost

INT ROOM 9930 - RESUMING (DAY) 7

The CONSTRUCTION CREW frames a WALL in the center of this

looks on as ELECTRICIANS run wires through the wall-studs

That was a test to see if Kate is easily thrown

KATE
Ya wanna duck down there and scrape

So much for throwing her
But Erics distaste for all this remains

KATE (CONTD)
Just so ya know nobody around here
likes the idea of embarrassing a guy
whos done 25 years of service But
we have reason to believe there are
other agents involved in this as well
- shared postings et cetera If
that’s true it could mean a huge
embarrassment to the Bureau

INT FBI HQ - 7TH FLOOR - CORRIDOR - MORNING 46
Welcome to the single most confusing structure on earth
Eric stares down two identical corridors that shear off from
one another at a 45 degree angle Yellowish lights overhead

not a window in sight A maze of intrigue

Sitting outside several offices are PALLETS piled high with
boxes of NEW COMPUTERS Theyre everywhere

And Eric is lost The numbers on the doors make no sense

Breach-Final 72006 13

INT FBI HQ - 7TH FLOOR - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - MORNING 47

More pallets on the floor More identical doors On a wall
behind glass a POSTER lists all of the FBI SPECIAL BADGES

A posted FLIER congratulates a secretary on her impending
retirement Her Party is next Friday Cake and Cookies

Eric drifts along until he spots a familiar name on the
NAMEPLATE beside a door Louis Freeh Director

Breach-Final 72006 14

Garces conceals a grin
49 INT FBI HQ - CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE 9930 - MOMENTS LATER 49

On the door of 9930 now is a sign identifying this as a SCIF
(SENSITIVE COMPARTMENTALIZED INFO FACILITY) Eric eyes the
sign and the plaque with Hanssens name and title on it

Then he swipes his badge works a combo lock punches numbers
into a keypad THREE BEEPS emanate And hes in

50 INT FBI HQ - ROOM 9930 - CONTINUING 50

We saw this suite being constructed an outer office with a
desk chair computer file cabinets And an inner office No

windows The door closes hard behind Eric its like being
sealed into a BANK VAULT or an air-lock

He crosses to his new desk sets down his gym bag sits

and is greeted with a loud CREEEEAK The springs in this
chair must be a hundred years old He sits forward The chair
creaks again annoying as hell

On the desk is an old IBM 350 computer He flips it on It
groans to life Beside it is a MANUAL OPERATING THE ACS
(Automated Case Support System) Eric opens it

Then he hears those same THREE BEEPS coming from the SCIF
Door 9 am on the dot The door opens

and Hanssen enters carrying his canvas briefcase and two
CARDBOARD BOXES (Today is his moving-in day too)

He pauses regarding Eric in silence Then that chair
CREAKS again and Hanssens mind becomes painfully easy to
read Who is this moron they put on my desk

Hanssen can do that to you just paralyze you with a look of
withering disdain Silence hangs until Eric gathers himself

ERIC
Good Morning

HANSSEN
Tell me five things about yourself
four of them true
Wait Whatd he just say

ERIC
Im sorry

Breach-Final 72006 15

HANSSEN
Game we used to play in the Soviet
Analytical Unit to keep ourselves

ERIC

bluffing

HANSSEN

That wouldve counted as your lie
right there

With that Hanssen ducks into his private office and shuts
the door Eric eyes it

INT FBI HQ - ROOM 9930 - LATER MORNING 51

Eric sits disassembling the MOTHERBOARD of that old IBM (He
unclips the RAM WAFER from its housing It has an ounce of
DUST on it) Each time he moves his chair CREAKS again

Hanssen emerges from his office bearing an EMPTY WATER
PITCHER He pauses eyes Eric then spots something offensive

on Erics desk and makes a bee-line for it

Eric braces himself as Hanssen grabs that ACS MANUAL off
the desk and tosses it into a trash can without ceremony

HANSSEN
Im going to be re-inventing how the
Bureau stores case information
Didnt anybody tell you that

and Hanssen exits the SCIF Just like that

A long beat - Eric waiting until its safe Then he rises
INT ROOM 9930 - HANSSENS OFFICE - CONTINUING 52

Hanssen drops down as Eric unloads the new computer

HANSSEN (CONTD)
Trying to re-route a phone line to
get Internet access

ERIC

that for you Sir

HANSSEN

Yes lets bring in an IT guy
making 35000 dollars a year and give
him access to hard drives that a
foreign agent would pay millions for

breast pocket (a PILOT DR-GRIP) And begins clicking and
twirling it Again and again

Breach-Final 72006 19

HANSSEN
These are the greatest pens in the

Eric waits pleased with himself But

HANSSEN
What is your drink then Gin

ERIC
(tries not to sag)
Scotch
HANSSEN

Its against Bureau policy for an
Agent to consume alcohol even off-
duty - did you know that - because
an FBI Agent is never off-duty

That comes from Director Freeh We
attend the same church Whos the

Eric tightens a screw on a new NON-SQUEAKING CHAIR as we
hear those THREE BEEPS at the SCIF door

Hanssen enters in his usual uniform dark suit red tie
Oddly today hes carrying a cheap-looking ROWING MACHINE

ERIC

Hanssen approaches and Eric tightens What kind of hoops

will I be jumping through today
Breach-Final 72006 25

HANSSEN (CONTD)
This is very good work

From his canvas bag Hanssen drops a 50-page DOCUMENT on
Erics desk Its the Kinkos-perfect Proposal for New SSG
Subject Database System that Eric wrote

But how did Hanssen get it Eric just stares for a moment

ERIC
Sir when did you--

HANSSEN
It was ignored Im sure

Hanssen tosses a PACKAGE into an OUT-BOX a manila envelope
addressed to a Jack Hoschouer in Bonn Germany He notes
the dog-eared PARKINSONS BOOK on Erics desk

ERIC
Yes Sir

HANSSEN
Thats because you dont shoot

On Erics reaction we CUT TO
INT FBI HQ - LEVEL 1 - CORRIDOR - DAY 59

This used to be the Reception Area for the FBI TOUR Now the
Bureaus discards have been shoved here old vcrs half-
desks used curtains The lighting is shadowy We hear

HANSSEN (0S)
The FBI is a gun-culture You cant
advance here unless youre part of
it

Eric and Hanssen walk past as we learn something else thats
odd about Hanssen he walks at an angle as if his gyros were

off cutting into Erics path completely

HANSSEN (CONTD)
Every Director in the history of the
Bureau has been from the Law
Enforcement side guys who shoot
guys who make arrests

Eric has to adjust his strides to keep from being walked into
a wall But Hanssen has no awareness of it at all

Breach-Final 72006 26

HANSSEN (CONTD)
Theres never been a Director from
the Intel side Never will be Intel
is Siberia the rubber-gun squad

ERIC
(trying not to trip)
So whyd you stay

Hanssen nearly walks Eric into a water fountain

ERIC (CONTD)
All those years Why didnt you
transfer into something with a higher
profile

HANSSEN

Because I didnt care about making
headlines I wanted to make History

(that landed)
The people Intel tracks are the ones
who wanna wipe America off the map
Somehow that always meant a little
more to me than chasing bank robbers
Whyre you reading about Parkinsons

They come to a stop at a BANK OF ELEVATORS just in time for
Eric to react to the change-up hes just been thrown

ERIC
My mother For a few years now

HANSSEN
Oh Im very sorry to hear that

Eric studies him for a hint of sarcasm or maybe another
test but that was sincere An ELEVATOR OPENS

Inside is a LOCAL-TV-NEWS-CREW a CAMERAMAN a male
PRODUCER and a BEAUTIFUL REPORTER (Shes 30 brunette
smoky eyes in a great-looking pant-suit)

Eric turns eager to see Hanssens reaction to her

Yet Hanssen doesnt react at all doesnt even look He just
enters the elevator Eric follows

Eric pauses certain Hanssens kidding No such luck

INT FBI HQ - DATA CENTER - LEVEL B-2 - DAY 61

A huge subterranean room computers mainframes servers of

Hanssen stands dead-center very much unimpressed To his

HANSSEN

I wrote a program last night using
nothing but ones and zeroes just to
see if I could do it 612 bits of
encryption completely unbreakable

(Garces nods)
But you get the office with the
window

Eric cant believe Hanssen would say that to a superior But
Garcess unoffended

GARCES
Okay Help us What do we do
Hanssen sighs jiggles his keys then he launches
HANSSEN

First we drop ACS which is a relic
not nearly enough band-width Thats
why youve got agents who still keep
sensitive information in cardboard
boxes We need to move to an ATM
system instead of the WAN An OC-48
with a data rate of 2488 Megabips
Start with Linux A-B servers which
puts us into Red hat IP routers
throughout the building Dynamic ip
addresses to hide the system using
the Invicta prototype with anexternal
internet connection Would it be
easier if I put this in a memo

GARCES
Yeah
HANSSEN
Fine On your desk in the morning
(at Eric)

Youre going to set up meetings for
me with the appropriate systems
managers at the CIA DIA NSA and
the intel agencies of each armed

Garces and Eric eye Hanssen Cant tell if hes kidding
INT FBI HQ - LEVEL 1 - CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 62

Eric and Hanssen emerge from an elevator When Hanssen is
agitated like this his gyro-less walk is even more
pronounced literally wedging Eric sideways now

HANSSEN
Perfect Were fighting crime with
19th century technology and hes
worried about protocol
(Eric nods)
You set up those meetings Leave it
up to him and theyll never happen

ERIC
Sir

HANSSEN
That was turf protection you just
watched in there - didnt you see it
Organizational arrogance No we
dont wanna learn anything from the
CIA we want the CIA answering to us

They pass by a door It has THREE SIGNS on it Sensitive
Compartmentalized Information Facility Restricted Access

Hanssen angle-walks past it Eric struggling to dodge a wall
HANSSEN (CONTD)

The enemies of this country arent so
picky They11 work with anyone who

At last he STOPS at a water fountain and changes gears

Eric eyes stacks of Catholic reading material A Voting Guide
for Serious Catholics The Popes Writings on Reproduction
And a pamphlet called THE PRELATURE OF OPUS DEI

HANSSEN

eyes a pamphlet called Seeking Holiness in Daily Life
Truth is he feels comfortable in here

HANSSEN
It was my wife who first brought me
here Bonnie I was a Lutheran when
we met and not much of one She
saved my life

Before Eric can reply Hanssen pushes open a pair of large
doors revealing the CHAPEL

HANSSEN (CONTD)

Thats why I come here every day -
to remind myself of the things that
matter

Eric kneels crosses himself whispers an audible prayer
Hanssen - whos been watching - nods satisfied

The things that matter in your core

In a House of God thats a loaded question

HANSSEN
Those are the three faith family
country Take care of them and the
agent part will take care of it
itself

not the sort of advice youd expect to get from a sexual
deviant - hence the look of confusion on Erics face

HANSSEN (CONTD)
(whispered)
We attend St Catherines on Sundays
A traditional Latin service Then a
big family lunch after Do you think
Juliana might like that

ERIC
I dont know

HANSSEN
Lets give it a try this weekend My
Bonnies been known to work miracles

Hanssen drops his head in prayer Eric studies him Their
eyes shut

when a SHARP SOUND shatters the moment interrupting

Erics pager It BEEPS obnoxiously Hanssen nearly recoiling
from the sacrilege

HANSSEN (CONTD)
Shut that off

ERIC

Eric silences the pager quickly A beat passes
then Hanssens anger dissipates He eyes the kid

HANSSEN

ERIC
No one else even has this number

HANSSEN
Oh Well Perhaps you ought to call
her Might be important

Breach-Final 72006 35

Eric considers that then

to Hanssens face

grandfather playing laughing Sunday barks happily

Eric sits in Hanssens chair and toggles the computer mouse
The screen comes to life revealing the last site Hanssens
been to

the official WEB-PAGE of the Vatican Of course

Now he feels like an idiot But he moves the mouse to a tab
reading Internet History and CLICKS on it The names of

twenty recently-visited web addresses fill the screen

He turns for another look out that window Just to be safe
Uh-oh Hanssen is no longer out there And we hear FOOTSTEPS

grabs the nearest book handy (The Man Who Was Thursday by

G K Chesterton) and pretends to be reading as

KATE (CONTD)
Come with me Therere a few people
Id like you to meet

INT WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE - C-TOC - NIGHT 90

This is a C-TOC (Command and Tactical Operations Center) A
high-tech vibrant situation room impressive as hell

40 AGENTS occupy two rows of NASA-like consoles The feeling
is precise focused If these guys are after you youre
going to be caught Computers are built into the consoles

We pass through this C-TOC in three directions picking up
EXCHANGES between Agents A few voices pop out at us

AGENT SHERIN
He badged out at 512 stopped at his
dry cleaners drove by Dead-Drop
Ellis then went home How does that
compare with the previous Thursday

AGENT NECE (INTO PHONE)
Has the Agency been briefed on this
If it deals with Russian sources the
Agency has to be briefed on it

AGENT LOPER
Does Hanssen have any leave-time
coming

AGENT SHERIN
Whats leave-time

That draws some laughs We land a CORNER of the room where
Eric stands dumbstruck Kate beside him He looks over the
room AGENT SHERIN AGENT LOPER three dozen others
Breach-Final 72006 48

One is AGENT DEBRA NECE whom we (and Eric) mistook not long
ago as the Passing FBI Secretary who joked with Eric about
the computer he was swiping in the 9th Floor Corridor

Eric tightens feeling small Behind him is a DATA ROOM in
which servers and mainframes wink in the dark way ahead of
the technological curve

(NOTE The C-TOC is ringed on three sides by interior windows
that reveal support offices and a huge BULLPEN of cubicles
and desks C-TOC has no exterior windows of its own)

ERIC
How many people are working this

KATE
Got fifty on the Bigot List so far

ERIC
Is the Director involved

KATE
The Directors running the case He
sees your pages every day
(that was another stunner)
Keep them coming by the way Our
audios missing about ninety percent
of what Hanssen says in there

ERIC
He mumbles
KATE
He does a lot of things this guy
Eric looks around all this manpower working one case
ERIC

Why dont we just arrest him

PLESAC (0S)
Cant do that

Eric turns to find DEAN PLESAC leaning in the doorway of
what we now realize is the same CONFERENCE ROOM in which Eric
was first assigned to this case

Plesacs 47 Kates superior He remains in that doorframe
like he owns the place

PLESAC (CONTD)
He knows the names and locations of
every source weve ever turned He
(MORE)

Breach-Final 72006 49

PLESAC (cont d)

knows where weve put our agents
overseas If we cant get him to talk
their lives are all at risk

Eric looks to Kate for an introduction

KATE
Eric ONeill Special Agent Dean
Plesac

ERIC
Sir

PLESAC

Director wants him caught in the act
of making a drop

ERIC
That would give you the Death
Penalty

PLESAC
Dont you think hes earned it

That lands just as Rich Garces emerges from that same
Conference Room carrying a steel briefcase - (he and Plesac
have just concluded a meeting in there)

Eric pales a bit realizing that Garces too has been in on
this all along

GARCES
See ya Dean

PLESAC
Thanks for coming in Rich

Garces passes by Eric hiding a grin
GARCES
Like I said Kid take nothing
personally
Eric just sags humbled
INT WFO - C-TOC - BULLPEN - MOMENTS LATER 91

We DOLLY through the busy BULLPEN as Eric follows Kate
Again the feeling is disbelief How did I miss all this

KATE
He has an appointment at the DIA
tomorrow at two right

Breach-Final 72006 50

ERIC
Yeah

KATE
Youre driving him

Eric mumbles a yeah as they arrive at her CUBICLE (its
slightly neater than those around it)

Kate opens up her desk grabs a KEY from it

KATE (CONTD)
We need you to keep him out of the
office for at least three hours
Thats when well be sweeping his

car

ERIC
Okay

KATE
Good

Key in hand she heads back toward the C-TOC with Eric in
tow We continue to TRACK THEM

KATE (CONTD)
How long would it take to download
the Datacard from his Palm Pilot

ERIC
Twenty thirty minutes depending on
the level of encryption

(she nods)
But you cant He never lets it out
of his--

She stops him with a look He re-considers
ERIC (CONTD)
Assuming we could separate him from
it twenty to thirty minutes

KATE
Okay

She opens a door leading him into
INT C-TOC - VIDEO ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 91A
With a THUNK a thick FILE is dropped onto a table in front of

Eric (Kate has just retrieved it from one of the several
large SAFES that line the wall of this room)

Breach-Final 72006 51

ERIC
Whats this

KATE
You wanted to be read-in right

Kate shuts the safe then heads for the door to leave Eric
alone with the file But before she gets there

She turns

ERIC
Kate

The kid looks lost

ERIC (CONTD)
What if hes smarter than I am
(hates to say this)
I never misread anybody that badly
before except maybe you

She breathes out a smile unaccustomed to humility from him
Seems like it wouldnt be a bad time to encourage him a bit

Eric wasn

KATE
A couple years ago the Bureau put
together a Task Force

t expecting a story

KATE (CONTD)

Lots of assets had been disappearing
sources like Motorin Martynov
dozens of them vanishing So this
Task Force was formed - to find the
mole who was giving them up Our best
analysts poring over data for
years looking for the guy But they
could never quite find him

(Eric waits)
Take a guess who we put in charge of
the Task Force

(Eric gets the idea)
He was smarter than all of us

That helped a little Kates about to go

KATE (CONTD)
Actually I can live with that part
Its the idea that my whole careers
been a waste of time - thats the
part I hate
(re the C-TOC)
Everything Ive done since I got to

Breach-Final 72006 52

KATE (cont d)
this office - everything we were all
being paid to do - he was undoing it
We all couldve just stayed home

Then she goesand Eric is alone Behind him a TV MONITOR
beams a live feed from inside 9930 To his right a window
looks out over the buzzing C-TOC Kate drifting across it

And before him is that THICK FILE

Reluctantly he picks up the first page and eyes it Its
words come alive in Hanssens voice

HANSSEN (V0O)
Dear Friends Thank you for the
50000 As far as the funds are
concerned I have little need or
utility for more than 100000 at any
one time It merely provides a
difficulty since I cannot spend it
store it or invest it without
tripping drug money warning bells

Eric puts the page down picks up another It sounds angrier

HANSSEN (VO CONTD)
I have come close to sacrificing
myself to help you and I get
silence I hate silence Conclusion
One might propose that I am either
insanely brave or quite insane Id
answer neither Id say insanely
loyal Take your pick there is
insanity in all the answers

Eric grabs another - noticing now that his hand is shaking

HANSSEN (VO CONTD)
The US can be errantly likened to a
powerfully-built but retarded child
potentially dangerous but young
immature and easily manipulated But
dont be fooled by--

The tail of that third one is now overlapped by a fourth

HANSSEN (V0 CONTD)
My Security concerns may seem
excessive I believe experience has
shown them to be necessary I am much
safer if you know little about me
Neither of us are children about
these things

Breach-Final 72006 53

We begin to hear several more now all at once

HANSSEN (VOS)

I found the site empty Empty sites
bother me I like to know before I
commit myself as Im sure you do
also

We move through in SLOW-MOTION now from Erics vantage-
point watching the Agents of the Field Office at work
grinding away sweating the details building their case

HANSSEN (VO CONTD)
I was unable to locate the package
based on your description last night
Please recognize that I am ina
business suit and cannot slog around
in inch-deep mud Meeting out of the
country is simply not practical for
me I must answer too many questions
from family friends and
government Perhaps some diamonds as
security to my children and some
goodwill so that when the time comes
you will accept my senior services as
a guest lecturer Policies are
constraints Constraints breed
patterns Patterns are noticed
PS your thank you was deeply
appreciated I decided on this
course when I was 14 years old Now
that is insane eh Your service has
recently suffered some setbacks I
warn that Mr Boris Yuzhin Mr
Sergey Motorin and Mr Valery
Martynov have all been recruited by
our special services

Its painstaking exacting work but it has to get done
Agents in the C-TOC and the surrounding BULLPEN - fueled on
pizza and coffee tireless Then we drift back to

opens before the key is inserted

ERIC

Sorry Honey I shouldve called

Eric gives her a kiss praying she wont smoke him out
Hanssen watches every nuance between them Assessing

HANSSEN
We were just hearing what it was like
to grow up in the Communist Bloc

ERIC
Oh yeah

HANSSEN
It piques my curiosity as you can
imagine

(Eric shrugs)
I hope it hasnt felt like an
interrogation Juliana

Juliana breathes out a smile trying as Bonnie brings a Pot
Roast to the table sitting

JULIANA

ERIC
Knock it off Jule

JULIANA
No thatd be easier for you

pregnant Your parentsd probably

early Why

ERIC
Whatd your father say

Now John really knows why Eric has come here He sits

JOHN

(remembering)

He could kill you with those shrugs

ERIC
Ive been thinking about him a lot

JOHN
Its a lot to put on yourself Son
He was just a kid doing his duty
Like you

Eric glances past John through a window where he can see
THREE WWII MEDALS encased in lucite sitting on a table

John eyes them too The sight of them takes him back a bit

JOHN (CONTD)
Get on the boat do your job and
get back home again

ERIC
Huh

JOHN
Its what he said to me the first
time I ever shipped out He knew I
was scared so he kept it simple

ERIC
Maybe I shoulda gone to Annapolis

JOHN
Always seemed to me like joining the
Bureau was your apology for not going
to Annapolis - which you never had to
do

Breach-Final 72006 60

ERIC
Its what you wanted

JOHN
I wanted you to serve your country
Is that what youre doing

ERIC
Yes

JOHN
Then you cant quit can you

Then he pulls a BULKY MANILA ENVELOPE from his canvas bag
Again its addressed to Jack Hoschouer in Bonn Germany

heating up on the stove Another glass of Scotch awaits

Before him is Hanssens MANILA ENVELOPE addressed to Jack

Then a SHRILL WHISTLE from the kettle pierces the silence
startling him Steam pours from its spout

Eric grabs the envelope carries it to the stove

INT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 155

Were on an unmarked VHS CASSETTE with a Post-It attached
Jack Think youll like this one Bob

Its not too late to stuff this tape back into its envelope

(which sits beside the stove in the kitchen) Instead Eric

turns on his TV and shoves in the cassette

First image on the screen shocks him Its Hanssens bedroom

shot in Hi-8 video from inside the mirrored door of their

ARMOIRE Bonnie lies in bed asleep

And a pit begins to form in Erics gut

On the monitor Hanssen crosses into frame on his way to the
bed behind Bonnie and peels back the sheets

He crawls in so that her body obscures our view of his and
begins to touch her We hear AUDIO now - her soft moans
Clearly she doesnt know shes being taped

Eric wants to look away but cant Hanssen unbuttons the
top of Bonnies silk pajamas until a sudden SOUND startles
the hell out of Eric And us

Its the front door Juliana just came home
Eric leaps for the VCR hitting STOP just as she enters the
room He doesnt have time to turn the tv off and doesnt

know if she caught the sound of moaning when she walked in

just seen but equally relieved that he wont have to explain
it to Juliana

never told me about this

The Andrews Sisters continue to sing away Eric looks around
trying to guess whats coming

But Hanssens not saying a word Its just a silent slow
drive The speedometer reads 15 mph

and theres nowhere for Eric to go He just has to sit
201 EXT ROCK CREEK PARK - ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 201

Hanssens Taurus pulls toward us parking at the entrance to
a thin TRAIL We peer inside the car the two men sitting

Eric tries not to stare

HANSSEN
Hafta be sure that I can trust you

Breach-Final 72006 96

ERIC
Why dont we go back to the office
You can polygraph me

HANSSEN
(with disdain)
Ever heard of Aldrich Ames

ERIC
Of course

HANSSEN
Worst spy in US history sold 25
million dollars worth of information

to the Soviets and passed every
polygraph the Agency gave him
(a beat)

But he never wouldve gotten past me
I can read anyone

Just then Erics PAGER RINGS Thats not good Hanssen
glares at the sound as Eric glances at the readout

HANSSEN
Im getting really tired of that
pager

Before Eric can reply Hanssen gets out of the car Eric
calls out to his back

ERIC
Whatre we doing

HANSSEN
I told you the FBIs a gun-culture
Ya cant advance here unless you can
shoot

With that Hanssens walking toward that trail into the
woods Eric gets out of the Taurus

EXT ROCK CREEK PARK - TRAIL - CONTINUING 202

Cold enough to see your breath out here Hanssen heads for a
dense wood by the creek - not a bad place to dump a body
(Chandra Levy will be found here in less than a year)

Eric follows twigs and snow crackling under their feet
HANSSEN

They test you at 25 yards 15 yards
seven yards and five yards

Breach-Final 72006 97

which is when Hanssen stops and pulls his 38 froma
holster

and FIRES at a nearby BRANCH a deafening sound The
branch is decimated

ERIC
Whatre you--

HANSSEN
You wanna be an agent or dont you

He turns and FIRES AGAIN blowing away another branch But
this time the gun is closer to Eric

HANSSEN
Prone left hand right hand five-
yards-with-gun-in-holster You get
three seconds to fire five shots

Then BANG Another blast Eric shies away

ERIC
Whatre you doing

HANSSEN
Who was that calling you in the car

ERIC
What

Another SHOT Eric spins away moving clockwise to stay out
of range

HANSSEN
I need to know if I can trust you

ERIC
Put the gun down Boss

HANSSEN
Who was calling you

ERIC
PUT THE FUCKING GUN DOWN

HANSSEN
I NEED TO KNOW IF I CAN TRUST YOU

Hanssens fires again Eric dropping to a knee Hanssen
stands over Eric now pointing the gun right at him

Then CLICK His 38 is empty

Breach-Final 72006 98

Theres a surprised silence for a moment No one moving
until Eric still on the ground finally erupts

ERIC
Can I trust you Jesus
(no reply)
Godsakes what is wrong with you

Hanssen doesnt answer Eric gets to his feet

ERIC (CONTD)
Look around you Boss its just us

(Hanssens silent)

Hanssen considers that his face a blank

then he turns without a word and starts a slow drunken
walk back toward the car Conversation over

But he stops just long enough to lean in toward Eric their
faces almost touching as

Then he hears the SQUEALING OF BRAKES and a SECOND VAN
appears out of nowhere followed by a white Ford Excursion

His head swivels A total of TWELVE AGENTS armed to the

(Hanssen doesnt reply)
Ive been in on a few of these now
Nicholson Aldrich Ames It goes a
lot easier if you co-operate On you
on your family

HANSSEN
You really ought to do an overhaul of
your GPS units Dean They throw off
a signal burst through the radio
Cant the Bureau come up with better
technology than that

PLESAC
We never had a GPS on your car Bob

HANSSEN
Oh

Hanssen shrinks a bit thrown Plesac stays on point

PLESAC
Even if all you give them is why you
did it it buys you some goodwill
(no reply)

Thats what Ames did at first anyway
- just gave up the why

HANSSEN
Must notve taken long All Ames
cared about was the money

PLESAC
Why else would he have done it

In other words Why the fuck have you been betraying your
country for 22 years Hanssen almost smiles Almost

HANSSEN

Oh its not so hard to guess is it
Considering the human ego

(Plesac waits)
Imagine sitting in a room with a

He backs away allowing the elevator doors to close
As the doors come together we MOVE IN ON HANSSEN

dim Then it starts to vanish entirely

He looks up confused as the doors meet one another and
Hanssen is in utter blackness We leave him there and

FADE OUT
