FADE IN

INT OPERATING ROOM - DAY 1

A tense surgery in progress Meters flicker instruments
flash in the bright overhead light In the midst of it all
stands DR DAVID RAVELL 35 The master of his domain
Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his
brow as he completes a last delicate procedure His co
workers sigh collectively with relief

DAVID
(to Asst Surgeon)
Close her up will you

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 2

Dr Ravell comes out of surgery clearly exhausted Without
his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome TWO NURSES
follow attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring
CHLOE 25 Raven-haired and striking and JASMINE 24 an
exotic mix of African-American and Asian

BLAKE DANIELS 58 the silver-haired Chief Surgeon rushes up
the corridor On his heels is DR LONNIE WALSH 33 Lonnie
is also conspicuously handsome but hell always be second to
David In everything

The look on Blakes face stops David in his tracks

BLAKE
Theres been a train crash near Santa
Barbara Theyre flying an aortal trauma
here now How can I ask you this
David
David rubs his eyes Thinks about it

DAVID
I can do it Blake

His bravery isnt lost on the two nurses although Chloe
exchanges a quick covert glance with Lonnie

CHLOE
Is he crazy Jasmine Hes been on his
feet for fourteen hours

JASMINE
Chloe its been this way since Leslie
died Losing himself in his work poor
thing

PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE LOOKING AT A TELEVISION SCREEN
BEHIND THE COUNTER OF A SMALL-TOWN DINER

INSERT FAIR OAKS KANSAS

INT TIP TOP DINER - DAY 3

Quaint Midwestern eatery Knick-knacks and photos abound
The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS A family
dining section off in one corner

TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets The older
of the two holds up his empty coffee cup But his WAITRESS
standing a couple seats down from him doesnt move Shes
completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on
two battered fuzzy TV sets

BETTY SIZEMORE 30 has a wholesome attractiveness that
competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white
waitress uniform TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers
behind her

The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera
But the older one still wants coffee He gestures toward
Betty
OLDER MAN
Miss

Betty leans forward grabs the coffee pot and moves in front
of him Without taking her eyes from the TV she pours the
java which somehow lands in his cup without spilling a drop

OLDER MAN
(contd)
Very impressive That is very
(turning to others)
Did anybody see that

The LOCAL GUYS around him dont even bother to look up Of
course theyve seen it before Betty smiles

OLDER MAN

(contd)
Thank you Could I bother you for a
little more

Before he can even finish Betty is topping him off with
milk

BETTY
Skim right
(tears open an Equal)
And half a pack if I remember correct

The older gentlemans mouth works a bit but nothing comes
out He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail She
looks at the younger man who is still following the show and
gobbling down a huge bacon burger

BETTY (contd)
You know youre never too young to start
on a lean meat substitute
(BEAT)
You wanna try some turkey bacon on that

YOUNGER MAN
You want a tip when Im through

BETTY
Its your body

Betty turns back to change pots The older man watches her
intently as the younger of the two mumbles to himself

YOUNGER MAN
(to himself)
Thats right so why dont you get up off
it
OLDER MAN
Wesley
(to Betty)
Ive told him the same thing Thanks for
the suggestion

BETTY
No problem

Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off one eye
always on the TV as she approaches two local types

SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD 32 a short tightly wound little man
sitting at his own booth Ballard is spit and polish all the
way creases in his shirt a glossy shine on his shoes
Badge proudly displayed He sits with

ROY OSTREY 31 a gangly bookish local reporter Betty
drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the
table for him Another smile

ROY

BETTY

ROY

BALLARD

(to Betty)

BETTY

Betty grabs Ballards plate without another word gives hima
reassuring rub on the shoulders and moves off He smiles
appreciatively after her then turns on Roy

BALLARD

ROY

embarrassing can eggs be

BALLARD

ROY

BALLARD

little longer anyway
Still carrying Ballards plate she returns to the counter

BETTY
Come on guys I told you its egg whites

(quietly)
I put him in that zone thing

COOK 1
Well it better be a pretty good size
zone if hes in it

Betty and the cooks share a quick laugh They move to change
his order while Betty glances up at the TV

INT HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - RETURN TO TV SCREEN 4
Lonnie catches up to Blake in the corridor

LONNIE

BLAKE

experience Lonnie

LONNIE

BLAKE
Lonnie its a complex procedure Why

LONNIE

out of medical school Blake

BLAKE

Blake exits The camera moves in to hold on a CLOSEUP of
Lonnies face as he simmers in anger Music soars

Frustrated Betty delivers several plates and drops them at
tables where the people know her by name She moves off
toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups
Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills When a
hand strays around to touch her ass she pushes it away with
her foot and keeps right on pouring Absently Betty takes a
look around the restaurant The other waitresses are gone
and no one is behind the grill Alarmed she pushes through
the double doors into the kitchen

INT TIP TOP DINER - KITCHEN - SAME TIME 6

THREE WAITRESSES along with the DISHWASHER and TWO COOKS are
standing in a row waiting for her

BETTY

They produce a life-size cardboard cut-out of Dr David
Ravell who looks dashing in his green hospital scrubs

Del pulls out and lurches across the room He reaches for
the desk phone but misses spilling down onto the carpet He
gathers himself and his pants up in disgust pawing around

remains where she is fuming

BETTY (V0)

LONG PAUSE Joyce looks at Del incredulous Then pissed off
He signals to hold on

BETTY (V0)

Joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up
her panties Del shoots her a look that says Im not

DEL

He throws the phone onto the cradle then bangs on a window
to get Joyces attention as she fires up a smoke

DEL (CONTD)
(through the pane)
Shit Joyce open the damn gate will

As Del zips up his pants Joyce trudges across the lot to
bring in the Closed For Lunch sign and open the gate Del
silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a
moment He takes in the banners the signs etc

DEL (contd)

As Joyce prattles on Betty notices the Buick LeSabre keys on
a rack behind her She sidles around Joyce deftly removes a

keys before her eyes Suddenly she jumps inside the
Chevrolet and slams the door

him another drink He gets a beer for himself and stands
behind Del Charlie sips his drink slowly savoring it

CHARLIE (contd)
You know a hundred and fifty years ago

about Native Americans Right here where
your house is - youd have been scalped

WESLEY

CHARLIE
It wasnt always fatal Wesley We could
scalp Del right now and hed be plenty
alive to tell us how it feels

Dels eyes get huge

CHARLIE (CONTD)
Its pretty simple too
(BEAT)

First you take a knife and just draw a
mark right across the hairline

Wesley produces a long knife and traces a line across the
very top of Dels forehead Trickles of blood wind their way
down his brow Del is MOANING and PANTING through his socks

CHARLIE (contd)
Hold still Del were just talking
here
(pointing to a spot)
Then you grab a big handful of hair and
pull as you cut Its amazing how easily
the scalp comes off

WESLEY
A mark huh

Wesley takes a jab at Dels forehead with his knife leaving
a small cut

Del starts twitching rocking back and forth as Wesley grabs
a fistful of his hair

WESLEY (contd)
Shut the fuck up I bleed more than that
when I shave

Del stops moving He breathes furiously through his nostrils

CHARLIE
Now I want to know the particulars of
your stupid act how you got what
doesnt belong to you who helped you get
it and of course where it is now

Charlie pulls the socks out of Dels mouth Del splutters
gasping for air

CHARLIE
So at a rest stop outside Logansport

something extra in one of your cars and
you decided to see what it was Then you
figured youd take this valuable
commodity and go into business yourself

you needed a crackerjack salesman to move
it so you made the biggest mistake of
your short life and chose Del Sound
right so far

herself onto Wesleys back knocking him to the floor

stares in disbelief at the blood rushing out of him Then at
Ballard as if trying to link the two
