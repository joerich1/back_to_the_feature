Suburbicon

Original Screenplay by

Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

This draft March 27 2007
Black

In black we hear a light irregular tapping thin and sharp as of something tapping against
glass

A slow fade-up defines crossing slats of wood—a window frame The panes themselves
remain black it is night

A delayed fade-up now defines a branch leafless and twisted tapping against a pane
We are looking out a second-story window

Now fading up is the rest of the tree a tangle of bare branches swaying

And finally the streetlit mansard and eaves of a house across the street solid suburban
We start to pull back A junior-scale baseball bat leans against the wall by the window
The continuing pullback shows a mitt and ball on a bookshelf nearby and other marks of
a young boy’s bedroom

Under the tapping of the limb the approaching murmur of male voices We hear
footsteps on a staircase as the two voices assume distinct characters—one placating one

gruff

The murmuring ends as we hear a door opening A shaft of light cuts across the room
Only one pair of footsteps enters

Our track back finds and settles on an eight-year-old boy asleep in bed A hand enters to
shake him awake

Voice
Nicky Wake up

The boy’s eyes open
Gardner his father stands over him in a bathrobe

Gardner
Nicky

Silhouetted in the doorway beyond him is a man in an overcoat

You have to get up son There are men in the house
The boy climbs out of bed and takes his father’s hand

UPSTAIRS HALLWAY
Nicky holds his father’s hand as they go to the stairs Following behind is the overcoated
man about thirty-five years old Hispanic heavy-set His mustacheless beard and
receding hairline accentuate the roundness of his face
We hear a stop-and-start electronic whir from downstairs
Gardner

Well just do what they tell us and they’ll leave soon

Everything will be all right
Nicky looks back over his shoulder at the man following behind

The man stares at Nicky as he walks No expression

The three begin to descend the stairs Opposite the bannister two rails are sunk into the
staircase wall The whirring noise grows louder

Gardner
These men are just going to look around a little and then
they’ll leave
Nicky looks through the bannister descending
The living room below comes into view foreground strobed by balusters Two women in
bathrobes are seated on a flower-print couch The first is a handsome woman in her early
forties —the boy’s mother Rose The second is a few years younger but is heavier and

less attractive—the boy’s aunt Margaret Both look apprehensively at

A second overcoated man riding a motorized wheelchair around the living room
stopping here and there to poke through drawers and shelves

Gardner twitches with anger

Gardner
Get the hell out of there

He lets go of Nicky’s hand and hurries down the stairs

The man in the wheelchair makes it pivot to face the stairs He is in his forties like the
other man heavy-set and roundfaced but Anglo crew-cut face shadowed by beard-
stubbled and punctuated with spikes of white nostril- and ear-hair He is Ira Sloan

Tra Sloan
Shaddup

The father stops in the middle of the living room

Get me a drink
They stare at each other Finally the father turns towards the bar at the back end of the
living room He pours some bourbon into a glass and starts toward the man in the wheel-
chair

Onatray

Another exchange of hard looks The father turns back to the bar for a small metal tray
places the drink on it brings it to Ira Sloan Ira Sloan reaches for it

Nicky is halted at the foot of the stairs He watches Ira Sloan
Leering at the boy’s father from the wheelchair Ira Sloan takes the drink from the tray
His hand is gloved—a leather driving glove with perforations for breathing and vents at

the knuckles

The Hispanic man Luis Colina pushes Nicky forward into the living room Luis Colina
is wearing the same driving gloves

Luis Colina
Gimme a drink on a tray too

Ira Sloan steps up out of the wheelchair He pushes the wheelchair toward the couch
At the bar Gardner finishes pouring the second drink and turns

Ira Sloan
Don’t give that to him Gets mean when he’s drunk

Gardner looks back and forth between the two men

Luis Colina
Give it here

Gardner looks at Ira Sloan who shrugs
Ira Sloan
All right Your fucking responsibility

Gardner crosses the living room to hand over the drink

Gardner
What do you want to do Let’s get this over with

Luis Colina is taking a sip from his drink

Luis Colina
What’s the hurry got an appointment

Ira Sloan
He’s got an appointment He’s got a social appointment

Luis Colina
Where’s the toilet

Ira Sloan
Forget that Let’s quit fucking around and go

Nick looks at Ira Sloan striding toward his mother Beneath his overcoat are what seems
like uniform pants blue with a darker blue satin stripe running down the seam to a pair of

shiny black lace-up boots

At the couch now Ira Sloan bends down towards the older woman his head close to hers
almost as if to kiss her

Ira Sloan
Just put your arms around my neck

She does

Gardner
Ill do that

Ira Sloan scoops her off the couch

Ira Sloan
Why don’t you just shut up She don’t mind

As he carries her over to the wheelchair

You don’t mind do ya ma’am
Rose
No

Tra Sloan
She don’t mind

Luis Colina
Tell me where the toilet is I gotta pee like there’s no

tamarra

Margaret
Through the hall on the left

Luis Colina
Thank you ma’am

Nicky walks over to his mother and watches Luis Colina leave He is also wearing the
blue dress pants and black lace-up boots Nick puts a hand on his mother’s arm

Luis Colina’s exit has left a lull in the talk Finally
Ira Sloan
If I were you I’d keep an eye on that guy He’s uh
whadda they say he’s loco ya know he’s outta his fucking
mind And he’s got a weight problem
He leans in confidentially to Gardner

You don’t think that was his first drink do ya

Rose
How can we keep him away from Nicky

Ira Sloan shrugs indifference

Tra Sloan
Beats me

Gardner
We have an understanding correct —

Luis Colina
(laughing as he reenters)
An understanding yeah
He is carrying a blue bath mat and a matching blue toilet seat cover in one hand A dark
metal box is tucked under his other arm He waves the toilet seat cover

This one-size-fits-all

Margaret
Yes it’s uh standard Standard size

Luis Colina
It better be How’s this thing work

He holds up a TiVo box its cords dangling

Gardner
You It records your television programs to a hard drive
but—
Luis Colina
Off the cable

Gardner
Yes but you have to up-res to high def— You have to—

Luis Colina
Ah fuck it

He drops the box clattering to the floor
Ira Sloan
Let’s quit fucking around
BASEMENT STAIRCASE
As its light is switched on Two rails like those on the upper staircase run the length of
the stairs At the head of the stairs Gardner wheels Rose onto the platform that travels on
the piping
Gardner
We have an agreement don’t we that if we Clarkate no

harm will come to us

Ira Sloan
Yeah we got an agreement but I ain’t God you know what
I mean
Gardner
(carefully)

No I’m not sure I do

Tra Sloan
Well that makes two of us

MINUTES LATER

Nicky and the rest of the family are in the home’s finished basement a rec room with a
pool table old television set etc

All four are seated Gardner and Margaret are already bound hand and foot Ira Sloan is
now working on Rose as Nicky looks on seated next to her As Ira Sloan finishes a knot

Ira Sloan
That more comfortable for ya ma’am

Rose
I’m fine Just please don’t hurt us You promised you
wouldn’t hurt us
Ira Sloan
Would we bother to tie you up if we were gonna hurt ya
It’s a question that answers itself

He looks at her for a moment

You must think we’re pretty sick A couple a animals
Is that what you think

She doesn’t answer Ira Sloan’s tone sharpens
Lasked you a question Smart guy

Gardner
No no she doesn’t think that

Ira Sloan
Shaddup I’ve had enough from you Don’t tell her what
she thinks
Rose
No I don’t think that

Ira Sloan has finished on Rose He straightens up glances over at Margaret

Ira Sloan
Youre pretty quiet over there

She doesn’t say anything
What do you think about all this

Margaret
I Tm sure you won’t hurt us

Ira Sloan smiles stoops down to start tying up Nicky

Ira Sloan
Lady you ain’t in a position to be sure about anything

He is thinking out loud
Anyway you make me sick

Rose
Do you have to tie him up

Ira Sloan
Jesus Christ think about it for a minute It’s a question that
answers itself
A cel phone rings
Ira Sloan and Luis Colina look at each other uncertain A beat
Luis Colina reaches into his pocket and takes out a phone He squints at its display

Gombrich

Luis Colina
Shit I gotta get this
Tra Sloan
You’re shittin’ me

Luis Colina
Nah it’s all right

Ira Sloan
You gotta be fuckin’ —

Luis Colina
Nah it’s all right Just keep it down No one talk

He flips open the phone his other hand held up toward Ira Sloan for silence
Hey man Not much Just you know on the job I
know I know Okay You too man Have a good
one

He flips the phone shut and looks at Rose

You got a bathroom down here

Ira Sloan
What You gotta pee again What’re you so fucking
nervous about

He straightens up from Nicky a little nervous himself

Just give me the chloroform

Luis Colina hands him a bottle Ira Sloan takes out his handkerchief soaks it and heads
for Margaret

We’ll start with the auntie over here Shut up her
yapping Auntie Em Auntie Em

He holds the handkerchief over her mouth
Just breathe normal
She struggles before passing out
God I love that fucking movie

Nicky shrinks back in his chair watching

Ira Sloan is moving for the father As he puts the handkerchief over his mouth Rose
starts to wail

Rose
No please don’t

Ira Sloan
Shutup you No more talking

As Gardner passes out he turns and walks towards the mother

As Nicky watches the man approach his mother he starts to struggle violently and cry
He is writhing in his chair as much as the rope will allow

Luis Colina
Do the kid He’s freaking out

Ira Sloan
Fuck you You do him

A pair of hands comes into frame with a red bandana soaked in chloroform

Nicky struggles tossing his head making it impossible for Luis Colina to press the rag
over his face

Ira Sloan stands behind his mother with a handkerchief Her eyes are on him

Luis Colina
Just settle down kid

Rose
Be gentle with—

Ira Sloan is pressing the kerchief over her mouth

Ira Sloan
We’re just gonna send him to Oz

Nicky still struggling looks at his mother
It li be a riot

Luis Colina gets his hands over Nicky’s mouth He settles down
His mother is passed out her head lolling onto her chest Ira Sloan re-soaks his
handkerchief grabs her by the hair pulls her head back and clamps the kerchief over her
mouth again

Nicky starts to struggle again but Luis Colina has his rag firmly over his mouth now
He sees Ira Sloan with his kerchief over his mother’s mouth

His eyes start to droop

He sees his mother’s legs They are starting to tremble

The picture begins to fade

Luis Colina
Jesus Jesus

Offscreen muffled mixing down

Ira Sloan
If you’re gonna puke do it in the bathroom Fucking
greaseball
FADE TO BLACK

FADE IN
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY WAITING ROOM

A middle-aged black man holds a blood-soaked towel around his arm waiting for
attendance In the background we can hear the squeak of rubber-soled shoes on linoleum
an echoing PA system occasionally paging a doctor etc

Nicky sitting opposite the injured man is staring at him He is pale drawn exhausted
He looks down the hall

Near the door to the waiting room his father stands listening to a short Oriental doctor
whose words are barely discernible

Doctor
—she’s on a respirator and we’re profusing her but
frankly the prognosis is not good Chloroform’s a
progressive depressant It works on the motors and usually
just has a temporary narcotic effect but obviously your

wife respired a lot more of the stuff
Nicky looks away the doctor’s voice continuing in the background as a muffled drone
The black man seated across from him looks at him impassively

FADE OUT

FADE IN
WAITING ROOM

Later Nicky is waking up as we hear a door open offscreen He rubs his eyes looks
across the room

The chair where the black man had been sitting is now empty There are a few drops of
blood on the linoleum floor next to the chair

On either side of Nicky Gardner and Margaret rise from their chairs Nicky’s eyes
follow them as they leave frame He edges apprehensively forward

His father and aunt are talking to the doctor His voice is muted solemn Margaret starts
sobbing Gardner nodding meaninglessly looks at the doctor looks at Nicky He starts
slowly across the room towards Nicky

Nicky watching his father approach sinks back into his chair

FADE OUT

CEMETERY

A sleek wooden coffin is being hydraulically lowered into a grave As it slips down it
reveals the members of the family and other mourners standing on the far lip of the grave
Nick is flanked on one side by Gardner and on the other by a stocky man with a solid
gut—Nick’s Uncle Mitch

Nick mutely watches the coffin being lowered as the priest intones a prayer
The hydraulics lowering the coffin make the same sound as the staircase wheelchair The

coffin comes to rest at the bottom of the grave The priest has finished speaking A
scoopful of dirt hits the top of the coffin

Gardner hands the scoop to Margaret She shovels some dirt into the grave then breaks
down Gardner puts a consoling arm around her and leads her away

Nicky watches them His father gives Margaret a consoling kiss

Nicky turns back toward the grave

Uncle Mitch scoops some dirt into it then takes a small flower from his lapel and tosses
it down onto the coffin

CEMETERY ROAD

Nicky Gardner Mitch and Margaret are approaching the family limo The priest is
hurrying to meet them

Priest
Please remember Gardner if there’s anything you need
don’t hesitate to call me Rose was a very brave woman
and

Mitch muttering draws Nicky away while Gardner and Margaret talk to the priest
Mitch’s accent is Bronx working-class

Mitch
Full a shit Come on Nicky let’s you and me take a little
walk
Nicky

Mitch

Nicky
Yes sir

Mitch
When you’re older you’ ll understand

He looks at Nicky and finally seems to realize he is talking to an eight-year-old He
smiles reaches out and pinches Nicky’s nose between the middle knuckles of his index

and middle fingers

Who’s got ya nose ya fuckin’ kid ya

Nicky
You do Uggle Mitch
Mitch releases Nicky’s nose
Mitch
Who loves ya like a son
Nicky

(rubbing the color back into his nose)

Nicky

Mitch is taking coins out of his pocket and slipping them into various pockets of Nicky’s
suit

Mitch
Who let’s you keep all the coins that stay in ya pockets

Mitch is scooping Nicky off the ground with one arm around his waist

Nicky
You do Uncle Mitch

Mitch takes one of Nicky’s ankles in one hand then the other ankle in the other hand
With the boy now dangling upside down Mitch starts shaking him vigorously
Apparently it is a ritual of long standing

Mitch
Goddamn kid you weigh a fucking ton

Coins are jangling out of Nicky’s pockets and spinning on the asphalt beneath him

LIMO INTERIOR
Gardner sits with Margaret in the back of their limo now tooling down the street
Gardner
Damn it Just once I’d like to see your brother show a little

sense

Through the windshield of the limousine we see Mitch standing in the middle of the
road giving frantic but comically silent bounces to the upside-down Nicky

Just once Id like to see that

EXTERIOR LIMO

As it pulls up next to Mitch The back door opens as Mitch lets the boy back to the
ground

Margaret
Come on kids

Nicky scrambles into the car but Mitch is on his hands and knees picking coins off the
pavement His face is flushed from the exertion

Mitch
Hold your hosses Maggie I’m paying for the limousine

INTERIOR LIMO

Nicky is seated between Gardner and Margaret Mitch faces them his back to the driver
At the cut we hear only the hum of the engine The awkward silence inside the car is
finally broken by Gardner

Gardner
Nicky we’ve decided that it would be best if your Auntie
Margaret stayed with us for awhile Youd like that
wouldn’t you

Nicky doesn’t say anything He stares out the window at the bleak cemetery slipping by
Mitch
If I didn’t have a business to run by God I’d stay too
Would you like that son
Nicky looks out the window silent
Margaret
He’s had a bad shock He doesn’t want to talk now I think

he just needs some time

Mitch takes a small flask of whisky out of his coat pocket unscrews the cap and takes a
long drought He offers it to Gardner

Gardner
No thanks Mitch

Mitch

Do ya good

Gardner
No thanks

Mitch shrugs and takes another swig He burps then sighs and looks out the window
He grimaces at a thought Angrily to no one

Mitch
What was with that suhvice

Silence
Mitch comes to He looks across the limo at the family
Mitch
Ill promise you one thing Gahdnuh If I ever get my
hands on the cocksuckas that did that to Rosie I’m gonna

Margaret
(sharply)
Mitch
Mitch looks at her puzzled then follows her glance to the child
His gaze drifts off again Again his face clouds
Mitch
What was with that suhvice
NICKY’S BEDROOM NIGHT
We are close on Nicky asleep in bed The thin sharp tapping sound the muffled
voices of the two killers echoing dreamlike footsteps approaching on the staircase
and the sound of his bedroom door opening —
Nicky bolts upright in bed sweating and the noises abruptly stop

He looks over at the door not open Hallway light leaks from underneath

But from downstairs a brief exchange of male voices and the sound of a door closing a
heavy door like the front door of the house Was it real

Nicky is breathing hard Slowly he climbs out of bed and pads across the room to the
door listening

THE HALLWAY

We are on the door to Nicky’s bedroom it slowly opens and Nick peers cautiously out
The hallway is empty

Nick emerges from the bedroom and heads for the stairway We hear Gardner’s muffled
voice then silence

Nick starts down the stairs

His point-of-view bannister rails strobe in the foreground the foremost part of the living
room is coming into view the backmost part is still hidden in by our high perspective

Nick slowly descends

Nicky
DAD

His dropping point-of-view shows more of the living room finally a pair of legs comes
into view and then the rest of Gardner striding into the foremost part of the living room

looking up the stairs Ice cubes click in the drink he holds

Gardner
Nicky How long have you been there

Nicky
1 had a bad dream

Gardner looks off screen

Gardner
Maggie

We hear footsteps and Margaret enters frame from the back of the living room wearing a
rumpled bathrobe She looks up at Nicky

Margaret
What’s the matter angel

Gardner
He had a nightmare Uh Maggiell put you to bed

Margaret has already started up the stairs extending her hand towards Nicky
Margaret
Come along sweetheart Auntie’ll tuck you in
THE BEDROOM
Nicky scrambles into bed Margaret starts tucking in the covers

Margaret
There’s nothing to be afraid of any more Nicky

Nicky
I know

Margaret
Did you say your prayers before you went to sleep

Nicky
Umm I forgot

Margaret
Well that’s probably why you had nightmares Shall we
say one together

Nicky
Uh-huh
Margaret
Which one do you say
Nicky

Our Father who art in heaven
Margaret recites with him

Nicky and Margaret
Hallowed be thy name
Thy kingdom come thy will be done
On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread
And forgive us our trespasses

As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation

But deliver us from evil

Margaret
Amen

She strokes Nicky’s hair

You know when you talk to God you talk to your
mother too because your mother is with God now

Nicky

Margaret
Your mother is with God but your daddy and me and
Uncle Mitch are still with you

Those men who came in the house
His eyes flutter open
Margaret is gazing down at him her mouth slightly open expressionless

After a beat she smiles reassuringly His eyes start to droop again They slowly close
and we

FADE OUT

BATHROOM MORNING

We are close on Gardner He is leaning into a a medicine cabinet mirror dressed in a
crisp white shirt with his necktie thrown over his right shoulder He is carefully clipping
his nosehairs with a small Hoffritz scissors

We hear a banging at the door

Margaret
If Nick doesn’t hurry up he’s going to miss the bus

Gardner
Ill drop him on the way to the train

THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE

Gardner leans in shrugging on his topcoat

Gardner
Come on Nick Get the lead out
THE STREET

Gardner pulls Nicky briskly down the street Gardner is carrying a leather attaché case
Nick carries a lunchbox

Gardner turns off the sidewalk to cut through a neighboring golf course

THE GOLF COURSE

As Nick and Gardner cross a green Gardner is setting a brisk pace now several yards in
front of Nickey

It is early morning The light is soft and low ground fog still covers the golf course
Gardner pauses at the top of a rise to wait for Nick

As Nick approaches we hear a sudden chicha-chicha-chicha as a dozen automatic
sprinklers sprout on the fairway below The mist from the sprinklers halates in the early

sun

Nick pauses beside Gardner Gardner puts a hand on top of the boy’s head as they both
stare down at the sprinklers the one holding a briefcase the other a lunchbox

After a long beat

Gardner
God life is a joke

FADE OUT

ELEVATOR

Gardner stands at the back of the elevator wearing a dark suit carrying a briefcase The
elevator doors open to admit two more passengers

Through a lavishly appointed executive suite A logo on the wall reads Pappas and

A tall deeply tanned man is walking towards the camera with his arms extended for an
embrace

Gardner’s then turns and drapes an arm around Gardner’s shoulder and leads him away

PAPPAS’S OFFICE
Gardner is sitting into a chair that faces the large mahogany desk Pappas perches on the
edge of the desk facing Gardner He looks at Gardner Gardner looks at him There is a

long awkward silence

Sears’ voice continues faint and tinny as Gardner leans forward to cradle the phone
He hits the intercom switch

Gardner
Hold my calls Linda

Linda’s Voice
Yes sir

He sinks wearily back into his chair
His eyes close A tear runs down his cheek
As he has rocked back in his chair his feet under the desk dangle above the floor

More tears drop from under his closed eyes Suddenly his eyes open He looks down at
his desk

He opens a top drawer and takes out two spring-tension hand grips He starts squeezing
them one in each hand

We are wide on the office as Gardner settles back in his chair once again closing his
eyes still weeping holding his hands out at either side and squeezing the grips his feet

dangling

The only sound over the drone of the air-conditioner is the squeak-squeak-squeak of the
spring grips

There is a harsh buzz from the intercom
Gardner leans for the intercom Hoarsely

Gardner
No calls Linda

Linda’s Voice

Margaret a worried expression on her face stands holding Nicky’s hand next to a police
matron

As they do so Hightower cuts the light in the viewing room and speaks through the
intercom next to the light panel

Ready for the swimsuit competition
The glass wall to the far side of the room shows a brightly lit platform a door at the back
of which is now being opened by a uniformed policeman Six bored-looking men enter
and mill vaguely about

Hightower
(into the intercom)

Just line up on that black tape on the floor gentlemen

They fall in

Gardner looks

Ira Sloan and Luis Colina are among the six men Luis Colina now with a discolored eye
Ira Sloan with a splinted middle finger

As Gardner continues to look through the glass without any visible reaction we hear a
door opening A wedge of light opens across the darkened viewing room The forms of
Hightower Gardner Margaret and the police matron are reflected in the glass that

separates the two rooms

Up on the platform Ira Sloan raises his hand to shield his eyes from the overheads
squinting out at the viewing room

Hightower calls over his shoulder

Hightower
Keep it shut please

He turns to look back up at the platform He hits the intercom

Could we offer you some opera glasses
Ira Sloan drops his hand from his eyes pausing to curl a fist and show his splintered
middle finger to the policeman

The viewing-room door is easing shut on its hydraulic stop Nicky now stands just inside
the door against the back wall of the room

The viewing room returns to semi-darkness as the door closes the backs of the heads of
his father and aunt and the policeman are foreground silhouettes blocking his view of the
brightly lit line-up

Hightower
(to Gardner)
Well
Gardner shakes his head
Gardner
No

Nicky rises to his tip-toes to get a better view

Hightower
Ma’am

Nicky shifts and cranes his neck
The line-up is now in view Ira Sloan and Luis Colina looking bored gaze out
Nicky’s eyes widen He looks at his father opens his mouth to speak is interrupted
Hightower
Turn to your right fellas You in the middle speak
English Your right El righto get me
He turns from the intercom to Margaret waiting for her confirmation She still sits mute
Gardner too looks at her expectantly
Hightower turns up a palm
Come on dear you’re not picking out wallpaper

Margaret turns and looks at him levelly

Margaret

Ww
Ww
No They’re not there I just wanted to be sure
Nicky astounded looks from her to his father

Nicky
Dad

Gardner turns abruptly to see Nicky for the first time

Gardner
What’re you doing here

He turns to Hightower
What is he doing in here
He strides over to Nicky
Come on This isn’t for you
Hightower glances casually back over his shoulder then looks at the matron
Hightower
Sarah take him out and keep him out will ya And you
stick around Mr L

He leans back to the intercom

The policewoman takes Nicky’s hand and starts leading him out of the room Nicky
looks back over his shoulder

Nicky
Dad I gotta

Hightower
No winners tonight Sorry boys I know how bad you
wanted that scholarship —

We are tracking back out of the viewing room Hightower is hunched over his intercom
Gardner stands rooted to the spot staring at Nicky Beyond him the line-up men are

filing out the platform door

In the foreground the viewing-room door hisses shut on its stop
CAR
Nicky sits in the front seat between Gardner driving and Margaret For a long while
nobody speaks and we hear only the drone of the engine Nicky motionless stares

straight ahead through the windshield Finally looking as they pass a gas station

Gardner
Never thought Id live to see the day gas hit three dollars

More driving in silence
Then

Margaret
Mrs Najarian sent some flowers

Gardner
She’s s fine woman We owe the Najarians a dinner

Margaret
The Stouts also

Gardner
Not on the same night though Herb and Thayer don’t get
along

Margaret

Oh Well just let me know when you think it’s proper to
start entertaining I was just rereading some of Life
Races—that book you gave me

Gardner
Yeah Dr uh

Margaret
Evan Maslansky You know how he talks about life being
a series of races where you have to triumph in each one
before you proceed to the next

Gardner
Mm

Margaret
Evan said that when you find a terrible hurdle in one of
your Life Races you can either remove it or choose another
Life Race
She looks cautiously at Nicky who does not seem to be listening
Well I just think we are being tested Gardner

Gardner
—Hmm I’m sorry I wasn’t listening

Margaret
Well I was just rambling I guess

Silence Finally as they pass another gas station
Gardner
Ill tell you one thing I never thought I’d see gas hit three
dollars

Nicky suddenly lunges across Margaret’s lap and claws for the handle of her door

Gardner
Nicky What the hell are you —

Margaret
ANGEL

Gardner not understanding what is going on has not slowed the car As Nicky’s feet
unintentionally kick at him he fights to control the car

Nicky starts vomiting into Margaret’s lap

LUIS COLINA’S APARTMENT
We push over Luis Colina’s shoulder as he pushes open a door to enter an apartment that
is a pandemonium of children yelling (the older ones) and bawling (the younger) A
diapered child sits in the middle of the living room banging on the floor with a dirty
frying pan
An Hispanic woman screams
Woman

He absently pulls an empty baby-food sized bottle from his shirt and unscrews its cap and
hands it to Luis

BATHROOM
We are close on the bathtub faucet dripping into the filled tub

Nicky lies in the tub watching the water drip There is a knock on the door and he looks
up

Nicky
Dad

Gardner walks in He looks down at Nicky and shuts the door behind him Gardner is
dressed in a three-piece business suit that looks too warm for the steamed-up bathroom

Gardner
So how’re you feeling son

Nicky
I’m okay

Gardner looks awkwardly around then perches on the edge of the toilet
Gardner
Fine fine It’s been a rough day How was your little

league practice

Nicky
I guess it was okay I worked on my stance

Gardner
Well good That’s fine That’s just fine

Rising to leave
Well you keep working on that stance

Nicky
Dad

Gardner turns His glasses are beginning to fog
How come you said it wasn’t them

Gardner freezes
Gardner
It wasn’t who

Nicky’s wet hair is plastered to his head

Nicky
It wasn’t the the robbers who who killed mom

Gardner starts to sweat in the heat of the closed bathroom

Gardner
Nicky did you see the line-up

Nicky
I saw—
Gardner
Because that certainly was not the robbers It certainly
was not
Nicky
But —
Gardner

Young man I want you to understand something People
walk into my office every day who say they’ve met me and
I don’t remember them at all

He works himself up

Sometimes I see people I think I know and yet they tell
me later that we’ ve never even met Maybe they look like
someone else maybe they talk like someone else maybe
they’re related —

Nicky
But Dad I —

Gardner
My point is that it’s a very shady business this who you
know and who you don’t know often one is mistaken—
very much mistaken and--and I’m telling you I got a good
look at those clowns and I’d never seen them before

Nicky

Uncle Mitch promised if I ever—
Gardner’s voice rises almost breaks

Gardner
Uncle Mitch doesn’t matter He’s a buffoon

Nicky shrinks

Gardner brings himself up short and composes himself Noticing that his glasses are
fogged he removes them and takes a handkerchief out of his pocket

Nicky watches From somewhere downstairs we hear Margaret starting to sing Her
voice filtering up into the utter quiet of the bathroom has an eerie clarity She is singing
Please Release Me

Gardner starts to clean his glasses the handkerchief squeaking against the glass

This is a family matter and I don’t want you talking to
Uncle Mitch about it Is that understood

Nicky
Yes sir

Gardner turns to leave
Gardner

It’s a terrible terrible tragedy
DISPATCHING OFFICE
Of the city bus system Route maps cover the cubicle’s walls schedules and papers
clutter the desk of the shirt-sleeved supervisor who works there Clement Greenberg On
his desk is a shellacked wood knickknack that shows the Twin Towers in flames and says

afterthought He spits on the papers strewn across it He turns back for the door

Ira Sloan
Big man Clement fuckin Greenberg

INTERIOR OF CITY BUS
It slowly cruises down the street Luis Colina is driving He pulls over to a bus shelter
where an elderly woman waits The door hisses open

The elderly woman gingerly steps in taking the stairs a cautious step at atime As she
reaches the top step Luis Colina looks beyond her at the open door

Ira Sloan still in his MTA uniform approaches the doorway

Luis Colina panics and reaches for the door lever The door hisses shut Ira Sloan has
one hand inside

Luis Colina hits the gas The bus lurches away
Ira Sloan’s hand slips out the door

Luis Colina is cruising out into traffic We hear Ira Sloan’s muffled shouts receding
outside Luis Colina looks in his side mirror

Ira Sloan runs down the street after the bus shouting arms pumping at his side
From the back of the bus

Voice
Driver That was my stop

The passengers all look apprehensively at Luis Colina

More Voices
Driver Driver

The elderly woman who got on at the last stop is swaying precariously in the middle of
the aisle Which way will she fall

Luis Colina looks from his rear-view mirror through the windshield

Up ahead the next traffic light is turning red

He reluctantly slows the bus to a halt He looks in his side mirror
Behind him the street is empty

At the sound of a loud SMACK his head whips around toward the door

Ira Sloan has one hand slid between the two door bumpers and is pounding on the glass
with the other

Luis Colina’s hand moves to the door lever hesitates for a moment then pulls The door
hisses open

As Ira Sloan climbs the steps

Luis Colina
What do you want man

Ira Sloan slaps at him awkwardly

Ira Sloan
What’re you doin’

Luis Colina pushes back

Luis Colina
What do you want

Luis Colina reaches a baseball bat from where it is tucked upright next to his seat

Tra Sloan
What’s that

Luis Colina
It’s my whacker man In case a whacko gets on the bus

Tra Sloan
Oh yeah

Luis Colina

other will do

A staring beat
Finally bat in hand

Luis Colina

Tra Sloan
Outside

He lowers his hands and takes one step back

Come on Friends Put away the fishbat Whacko

Luis Colina relents He tucks the bat back behind the seat and rises cautiously and sucks
under the handrail As he starts down the steps Ira Sloan is pushing him from behind

Voice

The bus is halted on a busy street Ira Sloan gesticulates angrily
Ira Sloan

Ira Sloan

LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD

A beautiful sunny day Nicky and several other kids his age mill about in the dugout all
dressed in their uniforms Approaching the dugout from his parked car is a burly middle-
aged man in Bermuda shorts and a sweatshirt with COACH printed on it This is the Pee-
Wee team’s coach Vern Wallerstein

As he approaches the team

Coach
All right line up you little shitbums line up line up

He sips from a beer can wrapped in a brown paper bag as he watches the boys line up
The field is not playable today
From the line-up comes a chorus of Huh and one piping incredulous What
Therefore practice is canceled
Moans from the team One disappointed Oh God
Coach looks around
Who said that Oh God— Who said that
A small Hispanic boy raises his hand
Boy

(eagerly)
I did Coach
Coach
Alvez I hate to be the first to break the news to you

He sips from the beer and gives Alvez a deliberate look
but God is dead

Alvez
What

There is a chorus of more disbelieving exclamations from the team Coach however
focuses on Alvez

Coach
You a religious man Alvez

Alvez
Uh-huh

Coach

Yeah well I don’t know what kind of bullshit your parents
have been teaching you at home but He died about three
and a half years ago in a car accident

The boys are listening with rapt attention the Coach straightens up from Alvez

It was quick All right get lost I got better things to
do

As the team slowly starts to break up

Voice
Coach

Coach turns back with a pained expression

Coach
Yes Siegelbaum what is it

Siegelbaum
My mom’s not picking me up for another hour and a half

Coach shoves a baseball bat in his hands and pushes him towards the dugout

Coach
Just go in there and work on your stance

SUBURBAN STREET

As Nicky walks home in his Little League uniform bat on his shoulder As he is about to
cross the street a city bus pulls up He waits for it to pass then crosses

LIVING ROOM

As Nicky lets himself into the house It is curtained against the bright sun and as Nicky
makes his way across the still room we hear only the soft hum of the central air-
conditioning

He leans his bat against the wall near a side table and his attention is drawn by some
brochures that have been left there beneath a burning light spread out next to Gardner’s
half-glasses and a mug of coffee still steaming

Nicky picks up one of the brochures

A ten-year-old child pictured on the front is wearing a dress uniform and has his white-
gloved hand raised to his forehead in salute The large-script heading says THE
CITADELA Place of Discipline

Nicky looks at it with growing consternation He puts it down picks up another
brochure VALLEY FORGE MILITARY ACADEMY’Preparing Young Men for Life

Another one FORT SNELLING Discipline and LoveCourage and Achievement A
Boarding School for Young Men

Nick opens the brochure Inside a young cadet is saluting two officers
Nick notices something with consternation The officers wear dark blue pants with a
darker blue satin stripe running down the seam They end in a pair of shiny black lace-up

boots

Nicky stares with mounting horror Suddenly there is a loud clatter from the basement
and Nicky freezes and listens

Stillness and then another clatter and the sounds of a struggle Galvanized breathing
hard Nicky picks up his baseball bat He stands frozen clutching the bat listening

From downstairs we hear Margaret scream

Nicky edges forward bat at the ready

STAIRCASE
Nicky’s feet cautiously descend He clutches the bat
From the rec room we hear

Margaret
Please please PLEASE

More clatter
Nicky throws open the door to the rec room He is brought up short

Gardner is on top of Margaret who is on top of the ping-pong table She appears to be
naked

Gardner who partially blocks our view of her is in a state of semi-undress Both are
flushed and sweating

Margaret clutches a ping-pong paddle in either hand
Gardner wheels to face the door his face panic-stricken
Margaret looks up also horrified

Margaret
Angel

She slides off the ping-pong table and runs into the bathroom wailing
Oh Lord

Gardner
What’s going on here Are you crazy

Nicky stares as Gardner approach him

Gardner
What’re you doing home
FADE OUT

FADE IN

From a long way up directly overhead we are looking down on the kitchen table

Gardner rises

The secretary stands bewildered in the open doorway

Ira Sloan slaps him again

Tra Sloan

Gardner

He has dragged the length of Gardner’s body across the desk and he now lets him fall on
his side of it

Luis Colina
Thass fucked up man

Luis Colina has been studying the knick-knacks on Gardner’s desk He picks up the grip
strengtheners

Ira Sloan grabs Gardner by the lapels again and hauls him to his feet He leans him
against the near side of the desk and slaps him again

gray cardigan sweater and reading glasses perched halfway down his nose sits behind a

wooden desk too big for the room reading THE BATES BOOK — Selling Direct

Behind him an aquarium is set into the wall The only sound in the room is the
intermittent blurrup of the oxygen compressor forcing air into the tank

Without looking up

Gardner
Close the door Nicholas

Nick does and sits across from the desk in a padded wicker chair
There is a long silence as Gardner continues to read

Finally he closes the book and looks up

Nick I have tried to instill in you a certain discipline
Maybe it’s my fault

He nods musing

Maybe it’s my fault Because it hasn’t taken But we
live in a world where there is no achievement without
discipline It’s a world of competitors It’s a world—the
adult world —it’s a world of things some pleasant some
not so pleasant Duty certainly Well Your mother
indulged you I think And that’s fine up to a point The
cocoon so forth That’s fine But now we draw the
balance sheet And we see where we are Do you
understand

Nick
Yes sir

Gardner
I see a little boy who is sullen I see a little boy who is
frequently withdrawn In his own

He waves a vague hand

little world A little boy with no friends Doesn’t fit in
And these things are important We don’t laugh these
things off Okay

Nicky doesn’t say anything

And so we’ve looked into sleep-away school A place
where young men learn about discipline And fitting in
The fledgling always wants the nest Nicholas But is it
good for him Is it good for him We’ ve consulted the
experts I think not

Nicky doesn’t say anything The aquarium compressor blurrups

think not Aunt Margaret and I have decided that
Valley Forge the Academy after consulting educators
we’ ve decided uh the best solution starting next
semester They’ ve made room for a new plebe they uh
you will wear the uniform Had to pull some strings but
uh I think you’re in Congratulations

He picks up The Bates Book

LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD
The coach is once again addressing the team assembled in the dugout
Coach
All right today we’re gonna start with the calisthenics you
know what they are when you’re done come and get me

Ill be in my car—

As the team starts to break up

Voice
Ah fuck
Coach halts
Coach
—What Who said that Everyone get back here Who
said that

One of the boys nervously raises his hand

Boy
I did
Coach
You know what fuck is De Luca
De Luca
Uhh uh-uh
Coach

You use words you don’t know what the fuck they are
Who here knows what fuck is

He looks around the team
Anybody

Alvez eagerly waves his hand to get the coach’s attention

Alvez
I do Coach
Coach
(dripping sarcasm)

Great Alvez is gonna tell us what fuck means

Alvez
My sister says fuck is like saying shutup to God

Silence
Coach stares sadly at Alvez

Coach
Alvez is there any idiocy in your family

He takes a deep breath and looks around at the team
Okay listen up Coach is gonna tell you what fuck is
Fuck is a man and a woman the night they get married
they take off their clothes in front of each other

The team listens with a mixture of rapt fascination horror and disbelief

The man looks at the woman’s tits he gets a hard-on it
comes out about yea long

He holds one hand out about three feet in front of his waist
And then they have babies That’s what fuck is
De Luca is incredulous His voice strains at its highest register

De Luca
What

Siegelbaum is nodding sagely
Siegelbaum
It’s true My folks gave me a book about it called “It’s
Perfectly Natural”

Another Boy

He’s crazy

Coach
Wake up De Luca you’ re living in a dream world

Siegelbaum
Yeah my folks said he was right about God too

Coach
(turning to go)
Siegelbaum no one here gives a flying fuck what your
folks think
Siegelbaum looks at his feet chastened

As Coach heads for his car Nicky runs up to him and tugs at his sweatshirt

Nicky
Can I talk to you Coach

Coach drapes an arm around Nicky’s shoulder as he continues to walk

Coach
Is it about ball
Nicky
No sir
Coach
So it’s a personal problem not related to team sports
Nicky
Yeah my dad —
Coach

Lodge let me tell you something When I was playing
Triple-A ball in Columbus I went to my manager once with
a personal problem and the manager said to me and Ill
never forget it he said Wallerstein I don’t care about
your personal problems all I care about is your
performance on the diamond Son I don’t feel that way I
don’t even care about your performance on the diamond

Coach drops his hand from Nicky’s shoulder and pulls away muttering as he recedes
1 guess that’s the difference between Little League and
the Minors

Nicky slows to a stop and watches the coach walk away

MASTER BEDROOM

Gardner and Margaret lie in bed

Margaret
It would be terrible if he talked to Mitch Mitch is so hot-
tempered

Gardner
He’s not talking to anyone He’s going to Valley Forge in
two weeks

Margaret

But is that good enough for these men We don’t want to
antagonize them

Gardner
What’re you talking about I’m not going to just knuckle
under to these clowns They’re goddamn bus drivers You
let me worry about them

Margaret
But if they say we have to do something about Nicky then
don’t we have to do something

Gardner

Margaret
Well I don’t know They don’t mean Valley Forge

Gardner
No they don’t

Margaret

Gardner

He nods
Believe me

Margaret
You know Gardner I don’t like these conversations And
I love Nicky as much as you do But this is the Life Race
we’ ve chosen —

Gardner
Shutup with that Life Race garbage It’s what got us into
this mess in the first place

Margaret
Please don’t be angry with me Gardner

Gardner
I’m not angry with you

Margaret breaks down and sobs quietly

Margaret
I didn’t mean to bring him to the station It’s just that there
were all those officers in the house all of a sudden I
didn’t want to disobey the officers Please don’t be angry
with me

Gardner looks at her still whimpering His manner softens She is so vulnerable

Gardner
Give me strength Maggie

Margaret
Well give each other strength

Gardner
Like last time

Margaret reaches up and rips open the front of her nightgown

Margaret
Look at my breasts Gardner Look upon them

HALLWAY

A seedy apartment building hallway whose ghastly unshaded fluorescents throw a sheen
on the white enamel-painted walls A door at the back opens and Ira Sloan emerges from
his apartment and goes to a door standing ajar near the front of the building and knocks

Tony Janson appears at the open door

Ira Sloan

LIVING ROOM DAY

Nicky kneels on a sofa that sits beneath the front living room windows looking out at the
street We hear rain pattering on the glass and drumming on the roof
The occasional car hisses by on the street outside It is a gray rainy morning From
offscreen we hear the sound of a television set broadcasting a soap opera

TV Woman’s Voice
You can’t go through with the operation

TV Man’s Voice
Don’t you remember what they called me in medical
school McKenzie the Mechanical Marvel I’ve got no
nerves My problems with Linda do not enter thisOR

A Chevrolet Monte Carlo pulls up into the driveway A tall man in a trench coat gets out
of the car looks briefly around then trots through the rain up toward the front stoop

Nicky hops off the couch as the doorbell chimes

FRONT FOYER

As Nicky enters The front door is chained higher than he can reach Nicky opens the
door as far as the chain will allow Through the crack in the door the man smiles down
at him He is craggily good looking

Man
Are you Nicky

Nicky
Uh-huh

Man

Is your father at home Nicky

Nicky
No sir

Man
Is your aunt here

Nicky

Uh-huh
The man is still smiling as he stands in the pouring rain

Man
Can I come in Awful wet out here

Nicky

Um I’m not supposed to open the door for strangers
Man

Oh my
Nicky

Do you know my Uncle Mitch
Man
I’m afraid I haven’t had the pleasure Do you think maybe

you could get your aunt Awful wet out here

Nicky
Ill go get her

As Nicky turns from the door

Man
Roger

Nicky turns back to the door and squints up at the man

Nicky
Are you an astronaut

The man laughs
Man
No I was too tall to fit in the rockets so they told me to go

into the insurance biz

Nicky nods at this then turns and goes

KITCHEN
As Nick enters from the hallway
The TV is louder here

2nd Man’s Voice
You can’t blame yourself itll only destroy you It happens

every day—

1st Man’s Voice
Not to me

2nd Man’s Voice
You’re not a miracle worker you’re a man Jim

Margaret is standing over the kitchen sink wearing rubber gloves and pouring Draino
into the standing water that fills the sink

As she works she occasionally glances over at a portable TV She notices Nicky

Margaret
Ill fix your lunch in a minute Angel

Nicky
There’s a man at the front door from the Insurance biz

Margaret starts toward the foyer stripping off her gloves and taking Nicky’s hand
Margaret
Oh goodness what pests
THE FOYER
As Margaret enters still leading Nicky by the hand

The man outside still waits patiently in the pouring rain

Margaret
Yes
Man
Miss Egan I’m Kenneth Clark from Canyon Prop and
Life—
As she starts to close the door
Margaret

Thank you for stopping by Mr Clark—
Clark
Kenneth is fine

Margaret
Yes—I’m quite sure we have all the insurance we need —

Clark
I’m sure you do but fact is I’m not a salesman I’m here to
discuss your sister’s policy

Margaret
Oh Well youll have to talk to Gardner about that
He’ll be home this evening he has all the information on

that
Clark
Could I just come in for a second Awful wet out here
Margaret
(flustered)

Well I don’t have any of the information
Clark
That doesn’t matter Miss Egan Id just like to chat with
you for a minute
LIVING ROOM

Clark is just taking off his dripping trench coat

Margaret
Let me hang that in the bathroom

Holding the dripping coat in front of her she trots out of the living room cooing
Ohhhhh
Clark
(calling after her)

I’m sorry it’s a lovely rug

Margaret bustles back in carrying an old sheet She walks over to where Clark sits on
the couch

Margaret
Could you get up for just a moment

Clark
Oh I’m sorry

He helps her drape the sheet over the couch then sits back down again Margaret sits
down on the edge of a chair opposite Clark

Margaret
I haven’t the faintest idea how I can help you since I don’t
have any of the information but uh What is it exactly
that you do for the insurance people

Clark
Oh I guess my official title is Claims Investigator what

you might call a professional skeptic

Margaret gives a little titter to acknowledge his smile

Margaret
Well I’m afraid I is there something wrong with the
policy
Clark

No no no no the policy seems to be all ship-shape Mr
Lodge’s been very steady with the payments your agent
um

He gropes for the name

Margaret
Mr Rosenblum

Clark
Right Bobby Rosenblum he tells me everything’s in order
Have you met him

Margaret
No I really don’t know anything about Gardner’s business
affairs That’s why I’m afraid I can’t—

Clark
Well I wouldn’t worry overmuch about information Miss
Egan because people always put information in quotes

He makes quotation marks in the air with his fingers
but it isn’t always like that I mean people just don’t
realize how much they know for instance you happen to
know the agent’s name

He is opening his attache case
Thave all that information here

He puts on a pair of glasses and flips through papers
Pm really more interested in the other kind

Absently as he continues reading

Which all really boils down to one word Do
you live here now Miss Egan

Margaret
(uneasy)
Well I’m here now of course

Clark
Is that a temporary or a permanent arrangement

Margaret
I I think that Nicky needs a mother

Clark
Of course

Margaret
What what was the word

Clark
Excuse me

Margaret
You said it all boiled down to one word

Clark
DidI Ohyeah Coincidence That’s what it all boils
down to Yeah it happens a lot in the opera
Margaret
Does it

Clark
Sure Aida Barber of Seville it’s just It gets ridiculous

Margaret
I’m not much of a—

Clark
But in real life it doesn’t happen much If it did I guess
itd stop being a coincidence It’s not the policy Miss
Egan it’s the claim Ya see a coincidence on a claim it’s
like a little red flag that makes us sit up and take notice
And this claim has a bunch of little red flags on it

Margaret
Good heavens—

Clark
Nothing to worry about believe me I’m just here to chase
down all those flags very routine We just have to have
them explained before we send out a check The claim will
be honored of course To the penny

Margaret
(relieved)
Oh that’s good

Clark
Oh sure Let’s just take a look here See the first little red
flag I noticed was that— March 3rd—about three months
before the uh incident—the amount of the term part of the
policy was substantially increased but there was no
increase on the whole life kind of unusual I don’t suppose
you know anything about —

Margaret
That was Gardner’s idea

Clark
It was huh Well I guess I’d better ask him about that this
evening What else have we got here we’ve got Oh
yeah more than one claim on a policy that’s always a little

red flag we’ve got that claim from 96 Rose’s car
accident you stung us good on that one well that’s okay
that’s what we’re here for—Oh Here’s a little red flag
didn’t even notice this before Jeez about five months ago
Mr Lodge redeems twenty thousand worth of his whole
life policy with us we always like to notice things like that
but I guess you know what he need the money for

Margaret
Oooh

She has just noticed Nicky sitting on the staircase his face pressed between two
balusters watching

Margaret dashes to the stairs takes Nicky by the hand and leads him up towards the
bedrooms Clark saunters over to wait for her at the foot of the stairs He looks this way
and that glances at his watch

Margaret descends the stairs alone and tentative

Margaret
I’m sorry that was money for Nicky’s college education

Clark nods sympathetically

Clark
College and orthodontia they really kill ya
Margaret
He has excellent teeth
Clark
Well thank God for that I guess he put it in a trust fund or
something
Margaret gropes
Margaret

Would you like a cup of coffee

Clark
That would be absolutely terrific

She is heading for the kitchen Clark idly follows her chatting on

1 don’t suppose you know where that account is— Well
it doesn’t matter Ill ask Mr Lodge about that one
Sorry to be such a pest I mean this stuff isn’t very
important But Ill tell ya I could put you on the floor with
some of the scams I’ve seen and I’m talking about real
knee-slappers I gotta smile just thinking about “em

He starts to laugh

Margaret looks at him

He laughs harder

Margaret starts laughing with him
IT mean I had a guy couple years ago puts in a claim for
his clothing store burned down you’re not gonna believe
this we find a couple gas cans in there with Eula May
printed on ’em his own wife’s name it’s the name of his
pleasure boat where he got the cans from

He laughs heartily

he thought those aluminum cans were gonna burn up or
something I don’t know what he thought

Margaret laughs with him
and cars Thank you
He takes the cup of coffee from Margaret and leans against the wall sipping from it
You wouldn’t believe what people do to their cars just
because something’s a little wrong with the transmission
and they figure they can fleece us for the whole thing Sell
em for scrap report “em stolen but the body shop guy

knows we pay a bounty for those things

As he laughs a little coffee dribbles out of his mouth down his chin He smears it away
with one hand

Excuse me Anyway

He sighs

Yeah you been in this business as long as I have you
develop a nose for hanky-panky Because it smells ya
know it has this

He flutters his hand
faint aroma This smells bad that smells good—you
know what I mean But this one—this particular case here

doesn’t have that faint aroma

Margaret
Thank goodness for that

Clark nods still smiling pleasantly
Clark

Nah this one stinks This one I’ve been smelling this
one since I got off the turnpike Jesus does it stink Ya
sleep with Gardner do ya

Margaret stares at him He continues affably
Well that’s none of my business But I gotta tell ya
this kind of nonsense it can come back to haunt you down
the road Ya see all the insurance companies

He laces his fingers together
are like one big interlocking network We all share our
files you won’t be able to buy yourself a policy at any
price And that’s serious I mean you could go to jail for
the rest of your life and have a shit credit rating

He sets his coffee cup down on the counter and turns to go

On the other hand it could be worse They haven’t
executed anyone in this state in over thirty years

Margaret stares as we hear Clark’s footsteps receding down the hall

Tell Mr Lodge that Ill be back this evening I’d like to
visit with him for a while too

We hear the front door opening

Hope I didn’t get the couch wet

We hear the front door slam shut

MTA LOCKER ROOM

Ira Sloan in his civvies walks down a corridor of lockers nodding occasionally to a
remembered colleague Through large double doors at the far end of the room we can
hear the hiss and chug of busses about to pull out into dawn for morning rush hour

Luis Colina sitting in front of his locker is handing some money to another driver as Ira
Sloan walks up to him

Ira Sloan
Youre taking the day off

Luis Colina
What Thanks man

The other driver nods and walks off Ira Sloan watches him go puzzled

Ira Sloan
Youre taking the day off I got more important things for

Luis Colina laughs nervously He rubs his forehead

Luis Colina

Ira Sloan

FRONT FOYER EVENING

As the front door opens and Gardner starts to enter a loud STING and someone lurches
at him

The scare subsides it is Margaret hugging Gardner her body heaving with sobs
Margaret
Gardner darling I’m so so so sorry Gardner I love you
please don’t be angry with me I’m so sorry

Gardner struggles to disengage himself He looks into Margaret’s tear-streaked face

Gardner
Maggie what is it What happened

Margaret
I’m so sorry a man came today from the insurance
company he said he was a professional skeptic but he was
so charming at first

She breaks down sobbing again unable to continue Finally
1 was so confused I told him I didn’t have any of the

information But at the end he knew everything he knows
everything he’s coming back everything everything I’m

so sorry
Gardner
(grimly)

When’s he coming back
Margaret

I’ll make it up to you I swear I will

Gardner shakes her
Gardner
When’s he coming back
Margaret screams
Margaret
THIS EVENING This evening He’ll be here again this
evening
Gardner hugs her
Gardner

It’s all right Maggie We’ll talk to him We’ll see how
much he knows

LIVING ROOM LATER

Gardner sits in the living room Staring Somewhere in the room a clock ticks Waiting
From offscreen we hear a snuffle

Margaret sits opposite Her eyes are red and puffy Tears roll silently down her cheeks
After a long silence she snuffles again
Gardner and Margaret sit waiting The clock ticks Finally there is the sound of a car
pulling up into the driveway Gardner rises and goes to the front door

FRONT FOYER

Gardner opens the door to Kenneth Clark

Clark
Mr Lodge
Gardner
Yes
Clark
Your sister-in-law might have mentioned me to you Can I
come in
Gardner
Yes
THE LIVING ROOM

As the two men enter Gardner motions Clark to a chair and sits down himself

Gardner
What are these accusations I ve been hearing

Clark nods at Margaret
Clark
Hello ma’am Ill tell ya some coffee would be really
terrific if it isn’t too much trouble

Margaret rises

Margaret
Yes No trouble

As she leaves

Gardner
What are these —

Clark
I’ve had a long day so let’s get right to the point You
killed your wife you’re trying to collect I’m between you
and the money Too bad for you I’m not gonna negotiate
on this I don’t wanna talk about it for a long time I’ve had
a long day I don’t wanna listen to any denials Just tell me
yes or no

Gardner sits stunned

Gardner
What what do you want You want a part of the
claim
Clark gives a tired laugh
Clark

I want all of it All of it You give me the money or you
go straight to jail pal

Margaret still snuffling enters with two coffee cups on saucers She hands one to
Gardner one to Clark

Clark
Thanks

Margaret leaves

you don’t have any choice I think a moment’s
reflection you can figure that out for yourself and then we
can discuss how we’re going to arrange it

Gardner licks his lips

Gardner
If we did if we did kill my wife what makes you
think I won’t kill you

Clark sadly shakes his head

Clark
Mr Lodge are you crazy You think I’m the only
investigator who knows how to read a claim for fraud Do
you have any idea what happens when an investigator

who’s working on a case like this dies Haven’t you
fucked with the insurance company enough

He takes a sip of coffee

Believe me if anything happens to me you’re in deep
deep—

Clark frowns Suddenly he rises to his feet He freezes for a moment He reaches down
picks up the coffee cup and hurls it at the living room wall

Coffee splashes and the china cup shatters against it
Gardner stares uncomprehending

Gardner
What the hell are you do—

Clark’s face is purpling and his mouth stretches wide He emits an ear-splitting
BELLOW

NICKY’S BEDROOM

Nicky wakes up to muffled bellowing He listens slowly rises and pads across the room

THE HALLWAY

As Nicky emerges from the bedroom The bellowing is louder here We now also hear
thuds and crashes from downstairs Nicky moves cautiously toward the stairway

THE STAIRWAY

As Nicky takes one slow step at a time down

His high point-of-view gives an oddly top-cropped picture of the pandemonium in the
living room below Clark is mostly just legs charging around out of control thumping
into furniture screaming his waving fists occasionally dipping into view
DOWNSTAIRS

Margaret is running into the living room with her hands over her ears howling

Margaret
Oh God Oh God Ooohhh

Clark is still careening around off the furniture like a chicken with its head cut off

Gardner stock-still in the middle of the cyclone shouts

Gardner
What did you put in the coffee Goddamnit What did
you do

Margaret

Oh God Just lye Just a little bit of Draino

Clark is ripping open the front of his shirt screaming as he staggers toward the foyer

THE FOYER

Clark reaches the front door He launches a fist through its window He reaches up and
claws desperately at his own throat drawing blood

He hurls the door open and staggers out into the night

THE LIVING ROOM
Margaret stands wailing in the middle of the room

Gardener hurls open the door to the foyer closet From a golfbag inside he withdraws a
nine-iron

Gardner
Stay here Stay here Don’t move until I get back

THE STAIRS
Nicky watches

Gardner’s legs are leaving the poker down at his side

SUBURBAN STREET

Gardner runs down the street Ahead in the dark we can make out Clark’s form as he
staggers crazily away struggling out of his suit coat clawing at his throat his white shirt
flashing Gardner shoots an apprehensive glance at the dark houses

Clark staggers sucking for air that won’t burn He is slowing his gait becoming ever
more herky-jerky

Gardner overtakes him and from behind swings the golfclub with a whoosh at the
insurance man’s head

On the thud we cut

STAIRS

Nicky descends cautiously quietly a step at a time From somewhere—not from him—a
whimpering sound

Margaret comes into view at the far end of the living room She is stooped over picking
up pieces of broken china putting them into a cupped palm whimpering

A creak in the stair—she notices Nicky straightens and moans

Margaret
Ohhh Nicky

Nicky heads for the front door which stands open

She drops the collected china and grabs the shovel off the fireplace rack but her manner
remains unthreatening

No Nicky wait
But he is running

She runs awkwardly after raising the shovel

PORCH
Nicky is off and away

Margaret emerges onto the porch but clearly will not catch him she stops at the lip of the
porch
Margaret
No angel

LIVING ROOM

Minutes later Margaret sits in the easy chair formerly occupied by the insurance man

sobbing as Gardner enters
His voice is dull

Gardner
I put him in the car

He looks at her crying
It’s falling apart Maggie It’s over All over
She shakes her head still weeping
We’ ll have to go away
His gaze drifts off up the stairs
Where’s Nicky
Margaret sobs

Margaret
Oh Gardner—he got away

Gardner squints incomprehension

Gardner
What’re you talking about got away

Margaret
I tried to take care of it I just—I just—I’m trying to
manage

Gardner

Margaret —what’re you talking about

Margaret
Oh Gardner

A MEZUZA

Tacked to a doorpost it has ornate metalwork and Hebrew letters We hear faint doorbell
chimes

Wider shows Nicky having just pressed the doorbell looking up at the mezuza
After a beat the front door swings open to reveal Sieglebaum in his pyjamas

Sieglebaum
Holy moley What’re you doing here Nicky

Nicky
Can I come in Noah My dad’s trying to kill me

Sieglebaum
Oh Okay

NOAH’S BEDROOM

The two boys sit on Noah’s bed in a small carpeted room littered with sporting gear and
electronic toys

Sieglebaum
Inside is a little piece of parchment with the Sh’mah on it

Nicky
What’s parchment

Sieglebaum
I dunno It’s old paper that the Pharaohs used Are you
staying over

Nicky
Can I

With a crash the door bursts open and Aaron Sieglebaum’s thirteen-year-old brother
strides in

Aaron

Where’s my Sega joystick you little faggot
Noticing Nick
—What’s he doing here

Sieglebaum
I didn’t touch your stupid—

Aaron has already grabbed Sieglebaum by the hair

AHHHHHHHH STOP I DON’T HAVE YOUR—
AHHHHHHH—

Aaron wrestles the flailing Sieglebaum to the ground and sits on top of his stomach
pressing his thumbs into the soft spots behind Sieglebaum’s ears He bellows

Aaron
SAY ’’M A FAGGOT I’M A FAGGOT

Sieglebaum
AHHHHHHHHHHHH

He starts bouncing his brother’s head against the floor in time with his chant

Aaron
’M A FAGGOT I’M A FAGGOT

We hear pounding footsteps and Nicky looks up from the fight as Mr Sieglebaum
appears in the doorway

Mr Sieglebaum
Cut it out Aaron

He wades in to break up the fight He hooks a hand under Aaron’s armpit and starts
leading him out of the room

You know who’s room this is

Aaron
Yeah well he’s been in my room the little faggot

Mr Sieglebaum
Hey Aaron
As he leads him out the door he nods at someone in the hall
They’re in here

They disappear around the corner

Gardner appears in the doorway

He and Nicky look at each other

Gardner holds out his hand

Gardner
Come on son

Nicky remains sitting staring
Come on

Nicky gets up goes to his father takes the extended hand

LUIS COLINA’S APARTMENT EXTERIOR

Luis Colina is exiting the four-story apartment building holding a baseball bat He
glances around as he heads for his car parked at the curb

Halfway there a vibrating hum stops him He fishes out his phone and squints at it
Gombrich

Luis Colina

He flips it open

Gombrich’s Voice

Luis Colina

Luis Colina looks wildly around His look lands on
A parked car someone in it Gombrich’s voice continues

LODGE HOME
Nicky is walking up the stairs immediately in front of Gardner
They go down the hall to his bedroom As Nick is about to enter

Gardner
Nicholas

Nick turns looks up
Do you need the privvy

Nicky
No

Gardner nods solemnly

He shuts the door behind Nick

We hear a key turning in the door and then retreating footsteps
A sharp thin tapping sound brings Nicky’s look around

The cherry limb taps at the dark of his windowpane

ERNIE GOMBRICH’S CAR

Gombrich looks over at Luis Colina as they drive down a suburban street Gombrich
looks forward shaking his head

A long beat

Luis Colina finally breaks the silence

Luis Colina

Gombrich

Luis Colina has just socked him in the face

Fuck —shit—

Ernie Gombrich fights to control the car as Luis Colina grabs his head and slams it into
the wheel a couple of times the car giving a brief honk at each impact

Bumps swerves a big bump and a wrenching impact

EXTERIOR
The car has hit a lamppost
Ernie Gombrich dribbles out of the driver’s side moaning

Luis Colina flings open the passenger door and emerges He leans back in for his
baseball bat

He rounds the car and starts whacking Ernie Gombrich’s head

MASTER BEDROOM

Margaret is in bed Gardner sits on the edge of the bed in his shirtsleeves elbows on his
knees gazing at a spot on the floor

Gardner
Aruba I think

Margaret
Where is it

Gardner
The Carribean It’s a Dutch protectorate there’s no uh
reciprocal uh extradition

Margaret
Well I don’t understand anything about that Isn’t it—

Gardner
We could take a boat from another island not leave a ticket
trail

Margaret

Isn’t it spicy mango food

Gardner
You can get any sort of food Food of any description
There’s golfing Couples golfing The windsurfing I
went with Rose many times

Margaret

Well that’s good darling You could relax You could

paint express yourself The artistic thing is important to

you I loved Rose but you need someone to help you

explore that side of yourself
Gardner continues to stare at the floor listening

We should have done this a long time ago You were

trapped at the agency Gardner—this is for the best
NICKY’S BEDROOM
Nicky sits in the dark on his bed knees drawn up to his chest
Sharp and present though not loud is the tap at the window
Muted by an intervening wall are the voices from next door their tones matter-of-fact
No words are discernible only the lulling back-and-forth of male voice alternating with

female

A new sound from outside the approaching rattle of a car whose fanbelt is rhythmically
slapping the engine block

Nicky rises and goes to the window

Ernie Gombrich’s car is pulling to the curb across the street its hood crumpled Once it
is parked its engine sputters and dies out along with its associated coughs and clunks

Nicky stares
No one emerges from the car
The muffled adult voices from the other bedroom drone on

FADE OUT

NICKY’S BEDROOM

It is early morning Nicky is still dressed but is now asleep on top of the bedcovers The
clunk of a car door wakes him

He goes to the window
Gardner’s car is pulling out of the driveway

The beat-up car at the curb across the street is still there Once Gardner’s car has pulled
away its door opens

Luis Colina emerges
Nicky’s eyes widen

Luis Colina looks up the street in the direction in which Gardner’s car disappeared
Satisfied that it is gone he pulls a baseball bat from his car He starts across the street

Nicky goes to his bedroom door and pounds

Nicky
Aunt Margaret

KITCHEN

Margaret stands at the counter making scrambled eggs glancing up occasionally at the
portable television

Voice
It’s beautiful Donna

Another Voice
The Butterfly Broach has a silver setting and five high-
quality zircon stones —
She reacts to the muffled pounding and shouting from upstairs
Margaret
Just a minute

MASTER BEDROOMBATH

With the eggs between toast wedges on a small plate Margaret walks through the
bedroom to the adjoining bathroom humming to herself

She sets the plate down next to the sink and opens the medicine cabinet
She raises her voice in response to the continuing pounding

Margaret
I’m just fixing your breakfast

She takes a small vial out of the medicine cabinet and sprinkles the contents of the vial
onto the eggs She uses the fork to mash it in She picks up the plate

She emerges from the bathroom and stops short with a quick intake of breath
Luis Colina stands in the bedroom doorway in his MTA uniform holding the baseball bat
Margaret stares
Margaret
Goodness I don’t know what your business is here but
youll have to talk to Gardner

Luis Colina steps hesitantly into the bedroom

Luis Colina
Sorry lady Iss just the nature of the way things is

NICKY’S BEDROOM

Nicky stops pounding at the sound of a scream The scream ends in a dull thunking

sound Nicky listens at the door A short beat Two more dull thunks

HALLWAY
Empty
A silent beat

Luis Colina emerges from the master bedroom holding the stained baseball bat He
closes the door behind him

We hold on the closed door as Luis Colina leaves frame We hear him walking down the
hallway opening and shutting doors
NICKY’S BEDROOM

Muffled here we hear Luis Colina’s progress in the hallway Nicky stands with his ear
pressed to the door struggling to control his frightened breathing

The footsteps approach
His own doorknob is rattled A pause Another rattle to confirm that it is locked
A muffled voice

Luis Colina
Kid

A THUMP at the door makes Nicky start Another THUMP It sounds like Luis Colina
is giving it the shoulder

Nicky scrambles to his bed and under it

His point-of-view from under the bed shows very little outside a dust ruffle comes
almost to the floor

The thumps continue the very bottom of the door trembling with each one but remaining
closed

Finally with the sound of wood splintering around its lock the door swings open

A beat of quiet
Nicky tries to quiet his breathing

A pair of black-shod feet enter topped by blue uniform pants The business side of a
baseball bat dangles next to his feet It is smeared with blood The feet take a couple of
hesitant steps in

The man is pausing looking around His voice is clear now

Kid

A couple more steps toward the bed the room is not big The feet are now planted
immediately in front of the bed

Motion in the feet the sound of knees cracking the dust ruffle is plucked up so that Luis
Colina can peer in at us his head angled sideways

Nicky stares back
After a long look a smile from Luis Colina
Hi

And then—oddly—he lets the dust ruffle drop He is gone but only for a moment
His arm reaches in It gropes blindly towards Nicky
Nicky presses himself against the wall and starts screaming
Just audible under the screams as the arm continues to grope

C’mon kid I’m sorry Iss just how things is

Nicky bats screaming at the groping hand but now it closes over his upper arm
tightens and starts to drag him

Nicky screams
There is a dull crunching sound and the hand stops dragging In fact it relaxes
There is another scream not from Nicky

There is another crunch that ends the scream and then three more at a measured pace in
the silence that follows

The hand is an inert thing Blood is seeping into the carpet from beyond Luis Colina’s

shoulder

Suddenly the shoulder and arm slide away dragged effortlessly and the dust ruffle drops
back into place

It is plucked up again and Uncle Mitch peers in

Mitch
Nicky

He helps Nicky scramble out and then scoops him up and tucks Nicky’s head into his
shoulder as he jogs him out the bedroom door

Don’t look Nicky don’t look It’s a mess
He lumbers down the stairs stroking the back of Nicky’s head
Was that one of the cocksuckas
Nicky sobs

Nicky
Yes Daddy’s a cocksucker too

HOUSE EXTERIOR
Mitch grim-faced jogs Nicky down the lawn to where his car is parked
As Mitch stoops to ease Nicky into the passenger side

Mitch
I’m takin’ you home Nicky My home Ow-uh home

Having deposited the boy he straightens

On the way you can tell me wusco non
He goes around the car and pops the trunk

and Ill take care of everything

The trunk holds security paraphernalia including walkie-talkies and clubs
and a snap-flap holster which he grabs There is also a small case Mitch

pops its clasps Inside is a handgun

Uncle Mitch’ll take care of it

GARDNER’S OFFICE
Gardner is striding for his office his secretary rises to greet him
Linda
Good morning Mr Lodge you’re early today —you don’t
have anything until ten
Gardner
I’m sorry Linda you’re going to have to cancel everything
today I’ve just come in to pick up a few things
He opens the inner-office door but pauses in the doorway to continue
See if you can get Erwin Panofsky at First Hartford on
the line before I go I need to talk to him about some fund

transfers and then I’ll need —

His eyes widen reacting to something oncoming a split second before Mitch’s back
enters frame and he is muscled backwards into his office

Mitch
SCUMBAGSSCUMBAGS I WANT HIS NAME

Linda standing in the doorway with her notepad and pencil emits sharp chirping
screams

Mitch slaps Gardner forehand and backhand
LWANT HIS SCUMBAG NAME

His hand closes around Gardner’s throat and he shakes him by his neck Gardner
struggles to get the words out

Gardner
Luis Luis Colina

Mitch’s veins are popping his face is beet red he is screaming
Mitch
I KILT THE FUCKIN SPIC I WANT THE UDDA ONE

Linda’s high piping screams continue ignored by the two men

Gardner
Tra Ira Sloan

Mitch hurls Gardner across the room where he lands in a heap

Mitch
Ill be back fa you

TONY JANSON’S APARTMENT

Ira Sloan is on the phone in the apartment of the gun salesman down the hall

Ira Sloan
Ain’t back yet When he leave

Barely audible filtered through the phone we hear a woman’s voice and the

pandemonium of children
From somewhere more present a muffled buzz
Ira Sloan sticks a finger in his ear

1 can’t hear you ya wha Yeah I know where he
went I’m the one who sent him but why ain’t he back

Two muffled buzzes in quick succession

Tony Janson is at a table a beer in front of him

Tony
That your buzzer
Ira Sloan
When he gets back you tell him to call me Fuck he can’t

call me

Another muffled buzz Tony raises his voice to Ira Sloan

Tony
Somebody’s ringin’ your apartment

Ira Sloan
Tell him he—wait maybe this’s him—

He lowers the phone mouthpiece to address Tony
Can you buzz’em in

Tony goes to an intercom by his open apartment door and holds down a button We hear
a heavy door unlatching down the hall Ira Sloan is back into the telephone

1 said maybe that’s—can you hear me Put a cork
innose kids why don’t ya

Mitch clomps by in the hallway some kind of aerosol in one hand eyes taking in the

number on the open apartment door and flitting without interest over Ira Sloan and Tony

Janson as he passes

Ira Sloan and Tony Janson exchange a look Ira Sloan hesitates at the phone
Uhnev mind Gubbye

Ira Sloan carefully cradles the phone We hear pounding on a doorway down the hall

Mitch’s Voice
Hello Ya deh

More pounding
Open iss daw
Ira Sloan clears his throat He asks quietly

Tra Sloan
Can I have a beer

Tony Janson is puzzled

Tony
A beer

HALLWAY
At the end of the hall Mitch is a small figure pounding on Ira Sloan’s door his back to us

Mitch
I know ya indeh ya fuckin scumbag open is fuckin daw

Ira Sloan emerges from Tony’s apartment holding a capped beer by the neck He walks
slowly down the hall Mitch’s noise covering his approach

Mitch unsnaps a holster on his belt
know ya indeh c’mon
He withdraws the gun

C’mon open iss dawn will talk ya fuckin creep ya—
Hrugh

Ira Sloan has clubbed him from behind

He clubs him down the door Mitch grunting under each blow Ira Sloan bends down to
pick up Mitch’s gun A hissing noise

Ira Sloan straightens screaming Mitch slumped on his back is macing him

Ira Sloan steps back still screaming He wraps his left elbow around his face and extends
his right hand with the gun He fires blindly

Bang Bang One bullet thunks the door One hits Mitch in the chest The third clanks
and starts an airshriek it has hit the mace

The pressurized cannister hits the ground and spins shrieking Mace sprays everywhere
Ira Sloan yells on firing Bang Bang Bang Bullets plug the wall Mitch’s body
Mitch’s face

Ira Sloan stumbles away screaming He blunders the length of the narrow hallway
caroming off the walls face still wrapped into his elbow He hits the front-door window

and it shatters He uncovers his face—starting to swell—to grope for the knob

He finds it and plunges out into the street screaming trailing broken glass

NICKY

He sits in a cheap formal parlor on an uncomfortable-looking Louis XV chair that
doesn’t quite let his feet touch the ground He is chewing a peanut butter sandwich its
plate and a glass of milk sit on a side table next to him We hear the TV off which he
watches The window behind him gives a view of a suburbia more downscale than his
own

A car is pulling up the drive though no sound carries through into the house Gardner
emerges from the car and we do just barely hear its door slam He trots toward the front
of the house his gait suggesting that he is unused to running stiff-legged with one hand
pressed down against his suit coat to keep it from flapping back as he runs

Nick continues to watch TV

GARDNER’S CAR
Gardner drives in a thin-lipped fury

Gardner
How did you get to Mitch’s house Who let you out

Nick is huddled in the corner of the passenger front seat

Nicky
Uncle Mitch brought me

Gardner grimly shakes his head
Gardner
I don’t even want to think about the two of you talking
saying crazy irresponsible thing words have conse-
quences Nicholas yes
Silence
Yes
Again he shakes his head
You are in deep deep doo-doo

He decides something

You’re going with us To Aruba You can’t be left to
yourself
He nods to himself
Margaret will understand

Nicky
She’s dead

Gardner looks at him not alarmed merely uncomprehending

Gardner
What

Nicky
One of the men from Valley Forge came back He kilt her

Gardner stares at him

Gardner
One of the what

He gives a strangled hiccough of surprise He glances front stares back at Nicky then
emits a short barking humorless laugh

Oh no No they wouldn’t do that She’s waiting at
homeNo

He stares out at the street his jaw working He suddenly busts out sobbing Through
tears

Pll tell you one thing son I’m not going anywhere
without Maggie Oh God Oh God

He bears down on the accelerator The car is picking up speed
Nicky speaks in a small voice

Nicky
Everybody’s dead God is dead

Solemnly

Gardner
Don’t ever say that son

Up ahead their house is just coming into view Parked across the street from it is a green
Delta 88 Ira Sloan has just gotten out of the car and is heading across the street for the
house At the whine of the approaching car he turns

His face is grotesquely swollen eyes puffed down to slits He squints through tears at the
approaching car mouth agape breath rattling snot flowing

He digs for his—Mitch’s— gun finds it levels it at the car
Gardner punches the accelerator

Impact From inside the car we see Ira Sloan’s body flip up over the hood smack the
windshield directly in front of us and flip back onto the roof

Gardner blubbers

Nicky shrinks Over Gardner’s wails another sound a thudding-bouncing on the roof of
the car

The car exterior Ira Sloan’s leg is caught on the roof luggage rack

Back to the interior the thudding of Ira Sloan’s body is painfully loud inside the car like
being inside a drum Nicky claps his hands to his ears Gardner wails

Ira Sloan’s head flops down directly in front of us and bounces against the windshield
His face is ballooned Blood streams across it

Nicky screams

Gardner blubbers

His foot presses the accelerator to the floor
Nicky screams

Ira Sloan’s head bouncing with the car sends blood streaming down the windshield
Wind feathers the blood back across the glass

Nicky screams looks from the windshield to Gardner
The car is speeding out of control

Gardner’s hands are clenched on the steering wheel Nicky’s small hands try to pry them
loose

Gardner’s foot vibrates against the accelerator Nicky’s legs kick at it

The car hits a bump there is the sound of rolling on the roof Nicky turns to look out the
back window

Ira Sloan’s body rolls onto the trunk and then off onto the street and bounces away
growing small fast as the car speeds along

Nicky looks back to Gardner who moans gasping for air

Gardner clutches at his chest with one hand His face is turning a deep shade of purple
He is displaying the classic symptoms of myo-cardial infarction

Nicky pries at Gardner’s hands which rigidly grasp the wheel Suddenly they grow limp
his head slumps down against the wheel staring glassy-eyed

Nicky screams The car gives a tremendous jolt and he looks front

The car has jumped the curb in front of a white colonial house and is speeding up its
manicured lawn churning sod

EXTERIOR HOUSE

At impact The car groans to a halt half-inside half-outside the house Dust from
splintered wood and pulverized wallboard eddies through the air The engine loudly
whines racing as the car sits on its undercarriage with the rear wheels off the ground

tires crazily spinning

FADE OUT

LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD
We pan the team as they listen to the coach—a voice we haven’t heard before

Voice
All right men excellent game today excellent You
displayed good attitude good sportsmanship good mental
alertness

The pan reveals uniformed Nicky a little bruised but not much worse for wear standing
next to Alvez

1 can tolerate an occasional physical error on the field
but there were no mental errors today

We finally cut to the team’s new coach He is a tall serious athletic-looking younger
middle-aged man in a pressed sweat shirt and sweat pants A shiny silver whistle hangs
around his neck
New Coach
and you’re to be congratulated for that You’ve shaped
up marvelously since Coach Wallerstein was was asked
to leave I guess our play-off berth is a testament to that

See you all next week but remember no one’s stopping
you from doing those isometric exercises at home

He blows his whistle and the team disperses
The new coach looks over at Nicky

Ready to go son

NEW COACH’S CAR

It is a country sedan station wagon full of Little League gear A bag of baseball bats
rattles in the back Nicky is strapped into the front seat next to the new coach

New Coach
I’m just warning you young man that kind of language

won’t fly in your new home

Nicky is gazing out the windshield

Nicky
Yes sir
The new coach’s voice softens
New Coach
All right then I wonder what Mom’s whipped up for

dinner

They are pulling up the driveway of Nicky’s new home a white Colonial with a
manicured lawn Laborers are working on the damaged ground-floor wall
