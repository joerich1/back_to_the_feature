INT A ONE-BEDROOM RENTAL - BEDROOM - DAWN

A cheap clock radio blinks from 629 to 630am instantly

uptempo rock music blasts mid-song WILL DENNING gropes for
the button but knocks the dial and now its loud static He
finds the power cord seizes it and yanks it from the wall

Will rolls out of bed in his underwear - young strong and
with absolutely no desire to start his day He hunts through
a pile of dirty clothes on the floor finally finds a
wrinkled ITX Transportation workshirt crumpled in a ball

Burn in Stanton Ohio
INT CONROY HOME - EARLY MORNING

LUCILLE CONROY (60s) draws a pair of curtains revealing a
small yard beyond it a stretch of train tracks She turns
from the window to address her grandson MICHAEL DENNING eating cereal as he watches cartoons

LUCILLE
Michael dear dont you want something
more for breakfast

DARCY DENNING (late 20s) hurries through carrying a laundry
basket her still-youthful beauty belying her weariness

DARCY
Hes fine Mom Don’t pester him okay

EXT CONROY HOME - EARLY MORNING

Will pulls to the curb in an old pick-up and honks the horn
His trucks interior is something of a mess A day-old box

of fried chicken is on the passenger seat Will warily opens
it finds a cold drumstick He sniffs it then takes a bite

Through his windshield he sees ED CONROY (60s) walking down
the driveway to get the morning newspaper Seeing Will Ed
barely nods Will returns the same cold gesture then takes
out his cell phone and dials RING RING

Through a window we see Darcy crossing for the phone
INT CONROY HOME - KITCHEN (CONTINUOUS)

Crossing Darcy glances out the window at Will in his truck

DARCY
Michael your Dads here
(picks up the phone)
Hi He’ll just be a minute

WILL (0S)
Your father looks thrilled to see me as
always

Darcy lets out a small sigh as if to say dont start

WILL (0S)
Whens your shift today

DARCY
Noon to eight Why

WILL
I was thinking maybe I could get Michael
after work Take him to Friendlys or
something

DARCY
Hes got Little League at five thirty

WILL
Yeah Great well I can-

DARCY
Dads taking him You want to go too I
guess thats up to you

Off his silence Darcy glances out the window at his truck

DARCY
Will

WILL
Yeah Ill see

A quiet beat as they regard each other through the window

DARCY
He’s coming right out

EXT CONROY HOME

Will hangs up sees Ed in the driveway now only a few yards
away newspaper under his arm Ed checks the time on his
watch then looks at Will with a hard disapproving stare

WILL
Its 705 in case your watch stopped

ED
Fitz said you were late last week I had
to call in a lot of favors to get you
that job You cant hack it just say so

Will fumes about to snap back but restrains himself and
simply flashes a flat smile

WILL
Good luck with the crossword

The front door now flies open and Michael bounds out Will’s
whole face brightens as his son races over to his truck - we
can tell this is the absolute highlight of Will’s day Ed
observes with a hard stare then returns to the house

ANGLE ON DARCY at the window a sad smile on her lips as she
watches Michael climb into Wills truck Will says something
that makes the boy laugh affectionately musses his hair
EXT STANTON STREETS - EARLY MORNING

As Will and Michael drive through the bleak working-class
town we spot train tracks at nearly every other turn

Will brakes before a RAILROAD CROSSING the gate lowered We
hear the whistle of an approaching train A PAIR OF LOCAL
TEENS on dirt bikes come up behind Wills truck barely
looking up as they skirt the gate jump the tracks and ride
on Five seconds later a FREIGHT TRAIN barrels past

EXT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING

Will dropping Michael off

MICHAEL
Bye Dad See you tomorrow

WILL
Okay bud Have fun in there

Michael hops down and hurries into school Wills smile
lingers as he idles reluctant to go He finally pulls away

CUT TO
INT BARNES HOME - BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING
In a towel FRANKLIN FRANK BARNES (mid 30s) stares into
his own eyes as he finishes his shave Despite the intensity
in his look his expression itself is hard to read
Burn in “Columbus Ohio”

INT BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Frank opens his closet pulls a neatly ironed and folded CSxX
workshirt off a hanger
INT BARNES HOME - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The kitchen like the rest of the house is clean but
modest not much money but plenty of love Wearing her
nurses uniform Franks wife VANESSA stands by the counter
her pretty face taut with private worry as she reads a
folded business letter

Meanwhile at the table NICOLE and MAYA are
finishing breakfast playfully arguing with each other

MAYA
It does not

NICOLE
Mom will you tell her that children
means under 7 years old

VANESSA
(not looking up preoccupied)
Girls enough okay

INSERT THE LETTER IN VANESSAS HANDS on Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen Local 515 letterhead is
a form letter addressed to Franklin Barnes

“Mr Barnes We are pleased to inform you that our union has
at last reached what we feel to be an equitable settlement
with ITX Transportation regarding those workers affected by
the companys reduction of operations

Finished eating the girls are putting their dishes in the
sink as 0S we hear Frank entering Vanessa quickly re-
folds the letter and returns it to its envelope

FRANK
Morning ladies

Now dressed in his neatly-ironed ITX workshirt Frank wraps
his arms around Vanessas waist and kisses her

MAYA
See Daddy didnt use his tongue

FRANK
Excuse me

Both girls crack up giggling

NICOLE
Nothing Bye Daddy

Nicole gives Frank an affectionate kiss on the cheek as she

(

hurries past grabbing her school books Maya too hops up
and kisses Frank then races after her sister

MAYA
Bye Daddy Bye Momma

Frank smiles after them then sits down at the table as
Vanessa sets his breakfast in front of him

FRANK
Thanks Looks great

Vanessa sits down across from him a faint undercurrent of
tension as she watches Frank read the newspaper as he eats

VANESSA
So I ran into Sue Murphy yesterday buying
groceries

FRANK
(doesnt look up)
Yeah

VANESSA
Theyre thinking Virginia now Judds got
a cousin works for a big moving company
there - Bekins or Allied I cant
remember Anyway theres an opening

Vanessa pauses to see if he might respond but he doesnt

VANESSA
She asked where we were with all this
I said we were just taking it day by day

Again she pauses then starts to say more -

FRANK
Vanessa -

VANESSA
Baby I know you think everythings going
to work out but-

FRANK
It will work out okay Well be fine

VANESSA
Its you Im worried about
(glances back at the letter)
I thought unions were supposed to save
jobs not negotiate severance pay 6
months 12 months like it matters
Maybe if you talked to management again -

FRANK
And say what

VANESSA
You could remind them 20 years youve
worked there a perfect accident record -

FRANK
Ialready did I reminded them They said
their hands were tied Theres nothing
more I can do except humiliate myself

VANESSA
You love your job - how many people can
say that Doesn’t that count for
something

FRANK
It counts Just not enough
(smiles gently)
Hey Look at me Ive never lied to
you have I
She shakes her head no

FRANK
Its going to be all right Understand

She nods reluctantly Frank kisses her forehead
FRANK
Ive gotta go
(rises from the table)

Dont want to be late for work
EXT HOOPER HOME - DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING
CONNIE HOOPER (late 30s) is late for work racing out the
front door clutching a stack of papers a coffee thermos and
a pop tart Her house is one of many crammed into this
middle-class neighborhood on the outskirts of the city

Burn in Toledo Ohio

Connie gets to her old Buick sets her coffee thermos and
pop tart on the roof fishes in her bag for her car keys

CONNIE

over hunting through his mess

CONNIE

She snatches up the keys - then frowns She picks up a
crumpled test paper marked D She walks to his bed - and
abruptly yanks off the covers

JASON
What the hell

CONNIE

JASON

CONNIE

JASON

EXT ITX ENGINEERING INSPECTION CAR - MORNING

A pristine construction-orange eyesore of a heavyweight
passenger car takes the alloyed steel tracks at 20 mph

Burn in Bowling Green Ohio (12 mi south of Toledo)
INT INSPECTION CAR
CLOSE ON A MAP of the regions rail system

WOMANS VOICE (0S)
(overly enthusiastic)
As many of you know 90 of all railroad
traffic is freight and ITX operates one
of the largest rail networks in the US

ANGLE ON JAN LEITCH (late 30s) a PR liaison with ITX
TRANSPORTATION addressing a small group of LOCAL OFFICIALS

LEITCH
Like everyone we‘ve recently felt the
impact of a changing economy Crucial to
our continued success has been the
advocacy of local politicians such as
yourselves And with the short line tax
credit extension soon up for a vote we
at ITX are grateful for your advocacy

LEITCHS ASSISTANT extends a quivering glass of OJ to a man
with the shallow good looks of a high-end car salesman His
name sticker reads BART CAMPOS COUNTY COMMISSIONER

LEITCH
Which is why we invited you here this
morning to thank you for your support

Campos flashes a polite smile whispers to his aide SCHIFF

CAMPOS
For Godsake how much longer

SCHIFF
Another half hour plus five minutes face
time at the rail yard

CAMPOS
And after that

SCHIFF
(checks his PDA)
Rotary Club of Toledos annual Pancake
Breakfast

Campos exhales wearily and resumes pretending to listen

LEITCH

-thought wed give you a sense of our
operation so weve hitched a ride this
morning with Region 2 Federal Safety
Inspector Scott Werner who is making his
quarterly track inspection Mr Werner
perhaps you can explain to our guests a
bit about what youre doing this morning

WERNER is a wiry man with crew cut and glasses clearly more
comfortable interfacing with equipment than people

WERNER
Basically Ill be conducting induction as
well as ultrasonic tests to measure track
geometry gauge profile alignment and
superelevation

Jan Leitch stands off to the side maintaining a forced
smile as she observes this snooze-fest She catches the eye
of County Commissioner Campos Campos smiles back

CAMPOS
(through his teeth to Schiff)
Get me off this goddamn train or I swear
Ill jump

Schiff catches Leitchs attention politely taps his watch

EXT A ITX TERMINAL - MORNING
Establishing shot of receiving and departing tracks
Burn in ITX SUBDIVISION Columbus Ohio

We find Frank heading toward the Dispatch Offices Nearly
everyone he passes greets him warmly Frank smiles says
hellos He glances around at the yard activity

FRANKS POV Crew loading freight cars Mechanics running
maintenance checks Locomotives everywhere Mens voices
clanging machines roaring engines A world all its own

ON FRANK hes going to miss this A hint of sadness in his
eyes even as he smiles at those he greets as he continues to

INT TERMINAL DISPATCH OFFICES - MORNING

Hectic The din of train talk and gruff laughter Assistant
Trainmaster FITZ paces behind a counter barking assignments

We find Will getting coffee from a vending machine In
contrast to the bustling camaraderie around him Will talks
to no one - an outsider A few older guys give him sideways
looks which Will tries to ignore

FITZ
Denning

Will glances up with a guarded expression

FITZ
Check the board I got you on a Detroit
run in twenty

ACROSS THE ROOM

Frank enters again greeted with warmth and respect by
everyone he passes He spots fellow engineer JUDD MURPHY
(40s) coming toward him They crack familiar smiles

FRANK

Will nods with a polite smile utterly devoid of enthusiasm
EXT FULLER YARD - EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT - MORNING

Connies car skids to a halt as Connie finishes applying
lipstick in the mirror her lack of technique suggests she
doesnt usually wear make-up to work

Burn in FULLER YARD Toledo Ohio

She hops out pops her trunk and takes out four boxes of
Dunkin Donuts She sets her stack of papers atop the donut
boxes and carries them through a mesh gate

toward the sprawl of 40 interconnected tracks hundreds

A train abruptly passes between them and we realize theyre
standing on separate sides of a track The train rolls on

Well Its not going to move itself

Dewey grimaces crushes out his cigarette under his boot

( )

CONNIE
Uh-uh

Humiliated Dewey slowly bends and picks up the butt

He strikes us a shy but good man with a quiet lonely life

WAITRESS

Ned shyly nods The waitress sets down his check

WAITRESS

some coffees I left them on the counter

Ned glances over to the counter where ten coffees are
waiting for him in a cardboard box

EXT ITX COLUMBUS SUBDIVISION - DEPARTURE YARD - MORNING

A maze of activity - trains constantly coming and going as

INT FULLER YARD - YARD TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - MORNING

Connie nervously observes the cars arrival below through
the towers LARGE PANORAMIC WINDOW turns back to Margo

CONNIE
Theyre here theyre here

Margo is almost done arranging the donuts in two pyramids

MARGO
Doesnt that look nice

Connie inspects the arrangement then re-configures the left
pyramid so a sprinkle donut sits on top matching the right

MARGO
You have issues you know that right

Connie grins at this then quickly straightens her blouse

CONNIE
How do I look

Margo spots a donut-frosting smudge Connie just made
straightening her blouse but decides its not worth it

MARGO
Perfect

Connie is about to thank her when she spies out the window

CONNIE
Damn it 888s still in the hump

She hurries over to the console grabs a radio
CONNIE
Dewey are you underwater Whats taking

Dewey starts toward 888s locomotive cab We glimpse the ID
number painted along the engine casing ITX 888

GILLEECE
Hold up you forgot to connect the air
hose from the point

DEWEY
Yeah So

GILLEECE
So the air brakes wont work

DEWEY
The dynamics will do were not taking
her far Ill connect the hose on the
departure track once Connies quit her
bitching

Gilleece frowns not entirely at ease with the plan
ANGLE ON ITX 888
As Dewey climbs in and engages the locomotive we hear the
engine roaring to life and in a moment the train starts
forward as we CRANE UP to get our first real look at it
Dewey wasnt kidding it is a monster 47 cars of varying
size and utility led by a new 5000-hp SD40-2 locomotive
with a freshly painted candy-apple red war bonnet livery
At half a mile long the train seems to go on forever

CUT TO
EXT COLUMBUS SUBSTATION - DEPARTURE TRACK

The relatively shorter train 1206 is presently idling before
a block signal

INT LEAD LOCOMOTIVE - ENGINE COMPARTMENT - MORNING
Will stands alone before the compartments equipment rack
He sets the startstop switch to PRIME listens for the
fuel pump to load the injectors Blowers begin to hum He
then rotates the control to the START position

INSERT SHOTS OF INDIVIDUAL CYLINDERS chugging to life

Will can hear the chugging getting faster In seconds the
entire train is rumbling and roaring

FRANK (0S)
Gotta love that sound

Will glances back to find Frank climbing into the cab

FRANK

This your first run in a Geep 60
WILL

Yeah
FRANK

Beautiful machines They built them back
when progress was measured in horsepower
not gigabytes

Frank pauses to admire the engine compartment
FRANK
They got great feel though and thats
what its all about

Will just stares back at him couldnt care less

WILL
Feel
FRANK
(smiles)
Feel

INT 1206 LOCOMOTIVE CAB - COCKPIT - MOMENTS LATER

Frank and Will settle into their respective positions in the
cab stowing their grips checking gauges

FRANK

(re Wills grip)
Might want to tuck that under some more

Will looks down - it looks fine to him - but he complies
Will then sits back peering impatiently out the windshield
at the block signal set to RED He huffs

WILL
Whatre they waiting for a different
shade of red

FRANK
Thats how it is around here always
hurry up and wait Youll get used to it

WILL
Great something to look forward to

FRANK
Meanwhile you can check your mirrors

WILL
I did Contrary to what your buddy back
there said I already had my training

FRANK
Well thats reassuring
(a beat)
You always this chipper in the morning

Will says nothing just stares out at the block signal A
train whistle blares beside them as a locomotive passes

FRANK
Listen what Ted said dont let it get
to you

WILL

Oh okay I mean the guy accused me of
stealing your job but youre right he
probably didnt mean anything by it

FRANK
He was just blowing off steam We all
know its a numbers game If it was up to
corporate the whole yard would be at
your pay grade No one blames you

WILL
Couldve fooled me

Through the windshield the signal turns from RED to GREEN
WILL
Finally

( )

From their console radio they now hear

DISPATCHER (0S)

FRANK
This is 1206 Ready when you are

DISPATCHER (0S)
All clear 1206 Youve got a good set and
release Have a safe run

FRANK
Thanks Jerry

Frank turns to Will and nods Will checks that the generator
field is ON sets the reverser to forward

Will then starts to reach for the throttle -

FRANK
Wait - give her a few more seconds

Will looks defensive like hes being tested
FRANK
Its an older train The releases on the
rear cars are slower than youre used to
(beat a slight smile)
They may have skipped that in training
Will hesitates still guarded unsure what to make of Frank

WILL
Now

Frank gestures for him to hold a moment longer head turned
as if listening for the sound amid all the others

FRANK
There - you hear that Like a breath

Will looks unsure he thinks he did He reluctantly nods

FRANK
Youre good Throttle to Run 1

Will shifts the throttle out of IDLE into RUN 1”
Gradually he releases the independent engine brake

INSERT EXTERIOR SHOT OF 1206 Before the train itself moves
forward the individual cars begin to part as the slack

between each coupler is taken up (this is called
stretching the train and its an impressive sight)

BACK TO FRANK AND WILL

FRANK
Throttle to Run 2 Whats your amperage

WILL
About 250

The train chugging louder turbochargers starting to whine

INSERT UNDERSIDE SHOT OF 1206 as the STEEL WHEELS turn and
the train slowly starts to move forward

BACK TO FRANK AND WILL

A faint glint in Franks eye he still savors the sounds and
feel of a train rolling out of a station The look on
Franks face intrigues Will a little causing him to regret
his previous attitude

WILL
(a gesture)
Run 3
Frank looks over meets Wills eyes a moment then nods

Will grips the throttle the cab louder now moving faster

FRANK
So tell me about yourself Will

WILL
What do you want to know

FRANK

Will glances over hesitates then carefully asks

WILL
So - have you got a new job lined up

Will nods sensing Franks casual attitude is something of a
front He considers whether or not to ask more -

FRANK

Will shifts to Run 4 and drops the subject

INT ITX 888S CAB
Dewey irritably mans the controls unlit cigarette dangling
from his lips Unlike 1206 888s cab is brand new and state-
of-the-art Computer screens occupy the bulk of its console
on which the ICE (Integrated Cab Electronics) glows
providing indications for nearly every facet of in-train
operations note 888s cab is a whisper cab so theres
a muted silence inside

INT 888S CAB

Dewey reaches for his radio to reply -- when the unlit
cigarette falls from his lips Grumbling he bends down to
hunt for the cigarette on the floor

GILLEECE (0S)
Dewey

Dewey finally finds his cigarette and grabs his radio

DEWEY
Hold your horses I was just -

Eyes now returning to the windshield he suddenly frowns

INSERT DEWEYS POV THE SWITCH FOR TRACK PB9 is less than
200 yards ahead its where the train is heading only the

track switch isnt aligned to permit it

DEWEY
Shit

GILLEECE (0S)
Whats wrong

( )

DEWEY
Damn trailing point switch is reversed -
the tracks arent aligned Hang on

Deweys eyes dart to the computers speedometer 11 MPH
He quickly throttles down to Run 1 He looks at the
speedometer it only goes down to 10 MPH

DEWEY
Come on you sonuvabitch

GILLEECE (0S)
Whatre you doing man

DEWEY
Slowing down whaddya think

Dewey peers out anxiously the switch for track PB9 is now
only 120 yards away He checks his speedometer only down
to 8 MPH He looks nervous as hell

DEWEY (CONTD)
Screw it - Im hoppin out

BACK TO GILLEECE OUTSIDE
He really doesnt like this plan

GILLEECE
Dewey man do not leave that cab

DEWEY (0S)
What other choice do I got - you want me
to ground the thing

BACK TO DEWEY IN 888S CAB

Deweys sweaty hand grips the dynamic brake lever and forces
it upward On the ICE display DYNAMIC BRAKE ENGAGED

He REACHES FOR THE THROTTLE shifts up all the way to RUN
8 We immediately hear the 5000 horsepower engine respond
Dewey checks the speedometer holding steady at 8 MPH

Satisfied he throws open the cab hatch and HOPS OUT

We HOLD however pushing in tight on the DYNAMIC BRAKE
LEVER Theres about an inch of space before the slot end
If it doesnt look right thats because it isnt fully set
The cab registers a JOSTLE - and the lever slips back down

On the cabs ICE display the word ENGAGED blinks off

INT FULLER YARD - YARD TOWER - CONTROL ROOM

EXT HUMP YARD

ON DEWEY hauling ass gasping as he finally makes it to
PB9s SWITCH STAND Dewey’s foot kicks the pedal releasing
the lever His arms work the lever eyes glued on ITX 888
coming toward him less than 20 yards away

CLOSE ON THE RAIL SWITCH inching into the forward position -

CLOSE ON ITX 888S LOCOMOTIVE NOSE as it rolls right at us -

ON THE RAIL POINTS as they lock in place seconds before
theyre draped in the trains shadow its wheels racing
right past us

CLOSE ON DEWEY relief washing over him He lets out a cocky
howl then grabs his walkie talkie from his belt

DEWEY
Man that was close

GILLEECE (FROM WALKIE)
(laughs)
Better get back on dickhead

Dewey chuckles smugly starts jogging after the empty train

Only as he jogs alongside 888s freight cars we see the
traces of his grin fading as he finds himself having to run
harder breathing harder - we see confusion on his brow for
some reason hes not gaining on the train like he should

INSERT 888S CONSOLE COMPUTER SPEEDOMETER the reading
creeps up from 14 MPH to 15 MPH

BACK TO DEWEY as he labors to pick up the pace running

harder now - yet hes only managed to overtake a few more
freight cars

( )

INSERT GILLEECE watching the scene from afar seeing Dewey
racing to keep up with the train

CLOSER ON DEWEY feet pounding ballast he overtakes the
last of the freight cars the locomotive cab now in view
Panting he finally makes it alongside the cab door

DEWEYS HAND reaches out and seizes the rail as DEWEYS BOOT
tries to find the steel step - only hes running too fast to
maintain his balance and no sooner does his boot touch the
metal than it slips off - as does his hand grip -

- and Dewey tumbles face first in a spray of rail ballast
INSERT GILLEECE gaping in a classic oh shit look

BACK TO DEWEY as he raises his stunned face from the dirt
to see the last car of train 888 rolling away

INT FULLER YARD - YARD TOWER - CONTROL ROOM — MORNING
Connie still doing her best to make a speech

CONNIE
In the end I really think it comes down
to good communication and to instilling
in our staff a sense of responsibility
for every single train in our -

PUSH IN TIGHT ON CONNIE as her brows furrow in confusion

CONNIE
- yard

REVERSE ANGLE CONNIES POV through the panoramic window
she sees train ITX 888 rolling right out of Fuller Yard

TIGHTER ON CONNIE as she hesitates swallows -

- when the far door BANGS OPEN Dewey and Gilleece standing
there panting Heads start to turn -

CONNIE

(quickly)
Im sorry - will you all excuse me just
one minute My dispatcher Margo Reese
will be happy to answer any questions you
might - you know

(starts for the door)
Ill just be a minute

Dewey starts to say something to Connie - she quickly shakes
her head briskly leading Dewey and Gilleece out into

A STAIRWELL (MOMENTS LATER)
Connie facing off with Dewey and Gilleece in hushed voices
CONNIE

What do you mean it got away from you
Its a train not a chipmunk

DEWEY
I had to leave the cab to throw a switch -

CONNIE
You left the cab Before or after you
applied your air brakes

GILLEECE
Neither Air brakes were disconnected
(corrects himself)
Are disconnected

Connie looks from Tweedledum to Tweedledee a knot in her
chest tightening

CONNIE
It was heading south on the northbound
track you do realize that

Both men nod anxiously

CONNIE
So youre telling me weve got an
unmanned train rolling into opposing
traffic with non-operational air brakes

DEWEY
I set the dynamic brake Thatll for sure
stop it eventually
(humbled)
Im sorry Connie -

CONNIE
From here it looked to be going about 10
miles per That sound right to you
Dewey nods Connie gnaws her lip her mind racing

CONNIE
Grab a HyRail truck and go after it Now

INT YARD TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Margo is in the midst of addressing the group as best she
can when Connie returns trying her nervous best at a smile

( )

CONNIE
Im sorry to cut this short but Im
afraid theres some yard business that
requires my immediate attention

Commissioner Campos couldnt be more relieved

CAMPOS
Not at all Its been very informative

He shoots Schiff a look that says lets get out of here
Confused Jan Leitch scrambles to keep up appearances

LEITCH
Before you all go Id just like to say
on behalf of ITX Transportation

CLOSE ON CONNIE as she beelines for Margo pulls her aside

MARGO
What is it You looked like you suddenly
had the runs or something -

CONNIE
Weve got a coaster

Margos eyes go wide -

CONNIE
Ssh Were gonna tackle this with as
little fanfare as possible okay Now
Dewey said he applied the dynamic brake
so friction should stop the damn thing
after a few miles In the meantime we
need to contact every northbound train
weve got on the mainline tell them to
pull into the nearest siding - first 20
miles of track take priority Weve got
to pull 888s bill of lading and I have
to call in to corporate and report this

Connies eyes are already on an electronic track map She
traces her finger from the yard up the mainline track to a
lengthy stretch of siding track at MILEPOST 5 (ie 5
miles south of the yard)

CONNIE
I want that train off the mainline

WERNER (0S)

(in background)
Im sorry - so there is no coffee

Connie glances up this suddenly gives her an idea
EXT A STREET - MORNING

Ned Oldham is driving his old PICK-UP TRUCK at slow speed
for fear of spilling the ten coffees on the passenger seat -
when his CELL PHONE RINGS Ned looks mildly surprised

NED
Hello

CONNIE
Ned how far are you from Milepost 5

INT YARD TOWER - CONTROL ROOM (CONTINUOUS)
Connie on the phone talking low to avoid attention

CONNIE
I need you to haul ass over there throw
the siding switch and wait Train 888
left the yard about 6 minutes ago
unmanned It should reach MP5 in about 15
minutes That should give you enough time
to throw the switch get it off the
mainline and onto the siding

BACK TO NED IN HIS TRUCK
Ned just listens quietly not the sort to get alarmed
NED
‘kay You want I should try to climb on
board and stop it
CONNIE
Youre a sweetheart but I’ve got two
hostlers on their way to do just that
You just throw that switch okay Ned
INT YARD TOWER - CONTROL ROOM

Connie hangs up whips back to her map when -

LEITCH
You were a little brusk dont you think

Connie spins to find Jan Leitch looking most unhappy
CONNIE

I regret that I really do but we have a
situation on our hands

( )

LEITCH
What kind of situation

MARGO
Connie Corporate on line 2

Connie looks nervous takes the phone braces herself

CONNIE
This is Connie Hooper over at Fuller

LEITCH
(turns on Margo)
Will someone tell me whats going on

CUT TO CAMPOS AND SCHIFF shaking hands as they try to
excuse themselves Schiff busily talking on his cell phone

CUT TO INSPECTOR WERNER considering a donut for the road
when he notices LEITCHS ALARMED EXPRESSION as Margo
explains something to her He then looks over at Connie
speaking tensely into the phone He senses somethings up

BACK TO CONNIE MARGO LEITCH
Connie still on with headquarters as Leitch grills Margo

LEITCH
What do you mean a coaster Theres no
one driving the train

CONNIE
Im sorry could you hold for just a sec
(cups phone snaps at Leitch)
Look this sort of thing happens okay
Were on top of it But right now whats
best for everyone is for you to get
yourself and these people out of here

Leitch is muted Connie resumes
CONNIE (CONTD)
I should probably speak to Mr Galvin
directly Well can you have him call me

then No I was just about to review
the bill of lading myself

She hangs up turns to Margo

CONNIE (CONTD)
Wheres that bill of lading

Will nods guard up instinctively

WILL
So you know Ed Conroy huh

FRANK
Not too well Only rode with him once or
twice But I do recall him being a fairly
unpleasant sonuvabitch
Will glances over at Frank surprised - then laughs

WILL
Id say you know him well enough

OFF THE BRIDGE NOW they take a treacherous-looking turn

FRANK
Watch your speed here Keep her under 20

INSERT A WIDE SHOT OF THE CURVE

Their train rolls slowly along the curve in the drop below
we can see a pair of cylindrical storage tanks

BACK TO FRANK AND WILL IN THE CAB

Coming out of the curve Will adjusts the throttle Frank
observes impressed by his handling

FRANK (CONTD)
What sort of work did you do before this

WILL
I drained sewers Down in Banksville

FRANK
(cracks a smile)
You serious

WILL
Laugh It was the best job I ever had I
ran my own crew made my own hours

FRANK
So what happened

WILL

Same thing happens to most people who get
married too young It didn’t work out

(beat)
Darcy and Michael moved back in with her
folks I tried the distance thing but I
needed to see him more than once a month
So I took the only job there is around
here

FRANK
Sanitation department wasnt hiring

Will cant help but crack a smile

WILL

As a matter of fact no

(shakes his head)
I swear though if you told me I’d be
back in Stanton working for ITX like
every other asshole

(realizes)
No offense

Frank shrugs it off with a grin He regards Will a beat

FRANK
For what its worth youre good at it

Will looks surprised by the unexpected compliment
FRANK
You got a real feel for the train Not
everyone does Youll do well at this
WILL

At least until they shitcan me too
right

Frank forces a brief uncomfortable smile

WILL
Sorry I didnt mean to-

FRANK
Thats okay Union got us a fair deal

WILL
But youd rather stay on right

FRANK
(matter-of-fact)
More than anything

Will is about to respond - but Frank cuts him off

FRANK
You can give her more here Were past
the rough spot

As Will complies he takes a last look at Stanton below
while Frank peers out pensively at empty tracks ahead
EXT MAINLINE TRACK -— MILEPOST FIVE SWITCH STAND

Ned Oldham is standing by the switch stand a few feet from
the northbound track the switch already thrown so that 888
will veer to the siding track However with the exception of
faint car traffic in the distance it is too guiet out here

Ned frowns checks his watch - when he hears an engine
gunning behind him He looks to find Dewey and Gilleece
rolling up in a HY-RAIL TRUCK a small maintenance truck
with steel-flanged wheels that allow it to ride the rails

Dewey leans out of the Hy-Rail looks to the empty siding

He glances over at Dewey and Gilleece now a few feet away

NED
— they said they were eyeing the mainline
the whole way over and didnt see it

CONNIE
I dont -- are you saying that train has
already passed

NED
Thatd be my guess yes maam

CONNIE
(stunned beat)
Put Dewey on the phone

Ned hands the phone to Dewey who anxiously takes it

CONNIE
I need you to rally every cell in that
brain of yours and think when you
applied the dynamic brake did you
counter with the throttle

DEWEY
Yeah - thats standard procedure

CONNIE
In what position was the throttle set

Dewey goes pale on his end Now he gets the implication

CONNIE
Damn it Dewey what position was that-

DEWEY
Run 8 full throttle I needed maximum
resistance

TIGHT ON CONNIE as she shuts her eyes Tries to breathe
DEWEY

Youre thinking somethings wrong with
the dynamic brake

CONNIE

Theres nothing wrong with that brake It
was inspected yesterday That train is
under power

(trying not to panic)
Okay Take the southbound track see if
that trains still going slow enough for
one of you to jump on We got to Milepost

Dewey hands the phone back to Ned Connies heart is racing

CONNIE

Theres a wand the engineer has to hit

automatically applied unfortunately this

Sir I would gladly explain the
particulars of locomotive operation to
you if we had time but right now I
really need your assistance posting

Thank you

Just one question how do you all plan to
stop it

EXT MAINLINE - SOUTHBOUND TRACK

Dewey and Gilleece are racing their Hy-Rail truck - which
for a Hy-Rail translates to about 25mph They pass a marker
for MILEPOST 9

INT HY-RAIL TRUCK

The Hy-Rail rattles turbulently both men looking fearful
scanning the tracks ahead They barrel over a dip -

GILLEECE
There

Through their windshield we can make out the REAR-MOST CARS
OF ITX 888 a good half-mile ahead on the northbound side

EXT MAINLINE TRACK

As the Hy-Rail truck speeds down the southbound track more
and more of 888 comes into view As it does the trains

sheer size and brute power truly hits us underscored by the
furious roar of its engines the relentless clacking of its
wheels the exhaust streaming from its stacks

CLOSE ON THE HY-RAILS WHEELS quaking wildly the thin
flanges just barely holding the rails

INT HYRAIL TRUCK

Gilleece looks at the speedometer theyre pushing 30 mph
The HyRail lurches and sways as if it could tip any second

DEWEY
Hurry up man The splits coming up

GILLEECE
Were barely staying on as it is

EXT MAINLINE TRACKS
The Hy-Rail teetering even more violently now as it finally
gains on the rear-most cars of 888 Dewey opens the truck

door closest to the opposing track

CLOSE ON DEWEY standing in the open doorframe gaping at car
after car whipping past the tracks a blur beneath him

GILLEECE
You sure you can do this

DEWEY
Just get us alongside the cab

Through the open door various freight cars blur past until
finally the Hy-Rail is inching up alongside the gleaming
cherry red locomotive at the head of the train

Dewey peers at the distance between the Hy-Rail and the
locomotive 15 feet at least He eyes the steel steps
leading to the locomotives closed cab door If he misses
those steps hell be sucked right under its wheels

Gilleece eyes the tracks ahead theyre fast approaching the
split where a PAIR OF TUNNELS is located

Sweat streaming down his face Dewey is still staring into
the rushing chasm between truck and train -

GILLEECE
Its now or never man

Dewey glances up sees theyre seconds from the tunnel
Breathing harder every limb trembling Dewey bends his
knees about to make the jump he knows its now or never -

DEWEY
Shit

He shrinks back from the open door gasping He shakes his
head crushed as the TRACK SPLITS into a Y and the Hy-
Rail truck is swallowed by the darkness of the tunnel

EXT TUNNEL - OTHER SIDE

888 BLASTS OUT with a roar - a good 20 yards away from the
southbound side on which the Hy-Rail rolls out in defeat

From the HyRails windshield the men watch helplessly as
888 veers off along the diverging northbound track in a
plume of exhaust Dewey reluctantly takes out his phone

and bad luck

GALVIN

Luck I was a YM for ten years before I
joined management - lucks got no place

GALVIN (CONTD)
in a rail yard Now what are we worried
about in terms of cargo

CONNIE
The diesel fuel is obviously a concern -

GALVIN
Obviously I said cargo

INTERCUT W CONNIE AS NECESSARY

CONNIE
Well our primary concern is cars 23 and
24 Theyre carrying a chemical called
molten phenol were still trying to
connect with the shipper to determine
exactly what it-

WERNER
(pipes in ever-the-nerd)
Its used in the manufacture of glue

CONNIE
Can you hold just a minute
(turns to Werner)
You know about molten phenol

WERNER
(doesnt everyone)
Yes

Mr Galvin theres an FRA inspector
here who knows something about this
chemical Ill put him on speaker phone

She clicks speaker phone gestures Werner over
WERNER

This is Region 2 Federal Safety Inspector
Scott Werner how can I-

GALVIN
Just tell me what you know about this
chemical

WERNER

Like I said its used to make glue Also
dyes disinfectants Its pretty serious
stuff extremely toxic highly volatile -

GALVIN
Is it combustible

WERNER
I would guess yes

GALVIN
Wonderful Hooper get state police back
on the line make sure they have a HazMat
team briefed and ready I take it youve
sided all other rail traffic

On our end yes Columbus is notifying
its own

Sir How are we going to stop this I
mean that trains en route to pass

Excuse me

racing over their train and again straight down the track

to be on the safe side

EXT FINDLAY CROSSING - MORNING

Inexpensive homes line the tracks as we find Ned driving on
a SERVICE ROAD ten cold coffees getting jostled in their
box Encountering traffic Ned brakes as he sees A CLOSED
RAILROAD CROSSING ahead gate lowered A lone overworked
POLICE OFFICER is redirecting traffic as best he can

Ned peers across the southbound side to THE NORTHBOUND SIDE
and its corresponding gate also lowered a LINE OF SIX CARS
waiting before it in vain In line is a van from which A
REPORTER and CAMERAMAN hop out and start toward the tracks

Seeing this the lone Police Officer abandons traffic duty
to jog across both sides of the mainline and wave them back

OFFICER
Hey You cant leave that van -

REPORTER
Im from Channel 10 news Whats going
on Every railroad crossings closed off
for a good twenty miles

OFFICER
Look Im just doing what they told me
Now get back in your vehicle

INSERT A NEARBY INTERSECTION (NORTHBOUND SIDE OF TRACKS)

A CHEVY 4X4 speeds through traffic a geeked-up RAILFAN
talking on a CB radio a camcorder on his passenger seat

RAILFAN
Im on my way now its gonna be awesome
Friggin 5000 hp SD-40-2 with a candy
apple livery 3-axle truck 3-axle Im
positive Youre thinking of the EMD
models Youre wrong dude

He reaches for his Trainspotters Guide flipping pages

DRIVER
Yeah Im looking it up right-- SHIT

The Railfan suddenly sees the HALTED LINE OF CARS just ahead
of him - he stomps the brake but theres not enough time
and his truck CRASHES into the car at the back of the line -

- setting off a CHAIN OF COLLISIONS each car SMASHING into
the next and in seconds THE FIRST CAR IN LINE (A TOYOTA) is
rear-ended - but with no car in front of it the Toyota
SMASHES through the lowered gate and bounces up onto the
northbound track where the dip between the rails stops it

Ned watches uneasily through his dusty windshield as drivers
and passengers of the other damaged cars climb out

The Toyotas driver a petite WOMAN is visibly in shock
The Officer arrives tugs open her door - then suddenly
freezes He hears something an approaching train

INSERT EXTREME CLOSE ON ITX 888S LOCOMOTIVE UNDERSIDE
The noise deafening Heavy steel wheels spin like buzzsaws

The Officers eyes dart frantically but a swell in the
landscape offers less than 100 yards visibility The
Officer quickly starts to pull the driver out glancing back
anxiously at the sound of the nearing train -

INSERT CLOSE ON 888S state-of-the-art CAB INTERIOR eerily
vacant and whisper quiet

The train now louder closer the Officer rests the Toyotas
driver down then glances back at the Toyota debating
whether to try to move it before the train comes when

THE TRAINS NOSE is suddenly visible on the horizon line
And on the faces of every bystander we see a mounting awe at
the massive power and size of this monster racing at them

CLOSE ON THE TOYOTA on the tracks a purse on the front

seat We feel the rattling of rails as 888s approach grows
louder the Toyota now starting to shake harder and harder -
so hard youd think the ground was just about to erupt when

SMASH the locomotive bashes the Toyota with a force so
jolting we can barely keep up as the car is plowed under the
sheer mass of the train in a violent spray of sparks -

TIGHT ON THE UNDERSIDE OF THE LOCOMOTIVE flanges struggling
to stay inside the rails screeching and sparking and for
an instant were thinking this train is going off the track -

- when the Toyotas frame abruptly SNAPS the car instantly
pulverized in a spray of parts and glass as 888 plows over

AT THE CROSSING Ned and other bystanders all gape in dead
silence like theyve just witnessed some extreme violence
they were helpless to prevent as the last cars of 888
shrink in the distance like a shark returning to open water

INT FULLER YARD - YARD TOWER - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

Connie is nervously scanning the electronic map ensuring
that the vast majority of nearby trains are already sided
888 blinks as a dot as it continues along the mainline -

WERNER
The mainline is class 4 track you know

Connie turns to find Werner hovering a few feet away

WERNER
Theres a speed restriction of 60 mph
Any faster and even a train as heavy as
your runaway risks derailment

He points to a spot on the electronic map about 50 miles
from where 888 is presently

WERNER
Then of course youve got that hillside
curve in Stanton You take that stretch
any faster than 25 and the laws of
physics alone will -

CONNIE
Theres no way that train is going all
the way to Stanton okay
(exhales assuring herself)
Theres no way

( )

ON MARGO looking stunned as she quickly calls to Connie

MARGO
Ned says 888 just obliterated a Toyota -
and stayed on the tracks

Connie looks incredulous how can this be happening

CONNIE
Tell him not to let it out of his sight

Werner notices Leitch seated anxiously nearby

WERNER
(a nerds matter-of-factness)
I guess this could shape up to be
something of a PR nightmare for ITX huh

Leitch looks up at him in baffled exasperation Campos and
Schiff now approach as if to justify their presence

SCHIFF
I dont see why you dont just lower
someone down from a helicopter

Connie just shakes her head Werner scoffs audibly

WERNER
I suppose its a viable option provided
we could requisition a Navy SEAL unit in
the next 30 minutes and had oh 7 weeks
to train an officer in the operation of a
5000 horsepower SD40-2 locomotive
Of course that would give you enough time
to remove all those pesky high-voltage
powerlines from either side of the track

Neither Campos nor Schiff appreciate the nerdy sarcasm

CAMPOS
Fine then what is the plan Ms Hooper

CONNIE
Thats what Im waiting to find out

SCHIFF
Waiting I thought you were in charge

Stung Connie says nothing just stares at the electronic
map feeling humiliated and powerless

derail it

Mr Galvin I know itll cost the company
a lot of money-

Because I think we might be able to stop
that train for you

WILL
(shocked)
What

FRANK
If we can catch up to it we could couple
to the rear try to slow it down -

WILL
Hold on a sec -

CONNIE
Frank I know you want to help but we
both know your train isnt fast enough to-

FRANK
Not our whole train Just our locomotive
Im talking about ditching our cars
going back on that track and chasing it
in reverse

CONNIE
In reverse

FRANK
The only way to counter that kind of
power is to grab on and pull in the
opposite direction

WILL
No No way -

CONNIE
Frank its next to impossible to do what
youre -

FRANK WILL

I know the risks Im not doing this

CONNIE
Risks That trains going over 60 Even
if you did manage to catch it youd be
coupling at ten times the normal speed-

Isaid NO

Frank and Connie are both halted by the outburst

WILL
You want to get yourself killed you can
do it alone

CONNIE
Alone is not even an option okay

Frank stays quiet his expression hard
CONNIE
Frank will you just -- will you at least
let me find out whats happening

dont give a damn about them They want
to treat people like garbage thats for
them to live with

WILL
Youre telling me this isnt about
getting your job back

GALVIN (0S)
She did Frank yes

Connie shuts her eyes feeling guilty but cornered

CONNIE
Frank I have Oscar Galvin VP of
Operations patched in at his request

GALVIN
Frank on behalf of ITX I want to
personally thank you for your offer But
its not necessary Were derailing 888
in Arklow thats a done decision No
ones happy about it but its our best
option at this point

FRANK
With all due respect Mr Galvin I
couldnt agree less

INTERCUT GALVIN IN HIS OFFICE
A glad-handing condescension in his tone

GALVIN
Frank we already lost one man today
Hes from Columbus - you probably know
him Jeff Murphy

FRANK
Judd Murphy
(crushed)
Youre telling me he didnt make it

CONNIE
Im sorry Frank

Frank struggles against a tide of loss and anger

FRANK
He shouldve never been out there in
front of it

GALVIN
In hindsight it was the wrong call-

FRANK
(furious)
It was a careless call Careless and
irresponsible

GALVIN
Be that as it may we dont want to lose
you as well

FRANK
(flatly)
No Im sure you dont

GALVIN
Frank we value your input and we all
appreciate your experience-

FRANK
Then listen to what Im telling you you
are taking too big a risk

GALVIN
Not according to our people here

FRANK
Have any of these people ever actually
driven a train

Galvin huffs his patient veneer quickly evaporating

GALVIN
Look we can control the outcome in
Arklow - theres a small population
already being evacuated and a workable
space Itll be a mess but well be on
top of it But if 888 derails any point
after that-

FRANK
Im saying it doesnt have to Not if I
can catch it and stop it

GALVIN
And what if you dont If I cancel that
derailer and you fail - which in all
likelihood you will - do you have any
idea the kind of catastrophe were
looking at in Stanton

FRANK
I know its a gamble -

WILL
Wait - what about Stanton

FRANK
(hesitates)
That hillside curve we took earlier The
maximum speed for any train is 25

CONNIE
(cutting in uneasy)
888 will be going close to 70 if it makes
it to Stanton Its a guaranteed derail
Theyre predicting the damage to that
area could be a hundred times worse

Will is stunned by this he looks to Frank and realizes
Frank was sparing him this knowledge

WILL
But then what if Franks right What if
that cookie doesnt work

ON CONNIE this is whats nagging at her too

GALVIN
Son trust me that train isnt getting
past Arklow Your engineer just wants one
last shot at being a hero Isnt that
right Frank

Frank fumes utterly incredulous at Galvins attitude

FRANK
You guys are unbelievable

GALVIN
Look Ive got a lot on my plate so let
me make this clear going after that
train will not save your job In fact it
will mean your immediate termination You
can kiss your generous severance package
goodbye and I personally guarantee any

( )

GALVIN (CONTD)
potential employer even thinking about
hiring you will get a call from me first

FRANK
Damn it youre sitting there wasting
time threatening me and Im trying to
help

GALVIN
We dont want it Is that clear enough
(a tense silence)
That is our property - not yours

GALVIN
Now you are to stay in the hole

Frank stares hard out at the tracks Finally

FRANK
Okay

Will looks quickly to Frank stunned

Frank can now make out Ned pulling alongside 1206’s
locomotive cab and the rearmost hopper cars Ned offers a
shy nod by way of a greeting as he speeds up to align
himself with

so that the flatbed is aligned with Franks upside-down

grasp of his ankle

FRANK

landing with a HARD THUD

CLOSE ON NED

peering back through the dust-caked rear windshield he
finds Frank getting to his knees He gives Ned a grateful
thumbs-up Ned steadies his truck and floors it keeping
pace with the train as his truck bounces wildly along the
ballast

Gaining speed he starts to overtake car after car of 888

wildly toward the steps trying to land on them -

CLOSE ON FRANKS SWEATY HAND as it slips down the rail
Franks body is about to get sucked right under the
locomotive his feet dangling mere inches from the steel
wheels racing like sanding belts

With an anguished grunt Frank GRABS on to the handrail with
his free hand pain clenching his face as he struggles to
pull himself back up up up

CLOSE ON HIS FOOT as it somehow finds the steps

Frank can barely breathe relief his eyes on 888s cab door

CONNIE (0S)
One of those mornings huh

Frank recognizes the voice he and Will quickly look over -

- to find Connie newly arrived and heading over to them an
emotional proud grin on her face

The two men get to their feet and each man embraces her it
feels like an emotional almost familial reunion - even
though theyve never met before

She takes a seat next to them and as they talk and shake
their heads and laugh and talk some more were already
craning away until the only thing that dominates our frame
is the tamed half-mile of train that is ITX 888
