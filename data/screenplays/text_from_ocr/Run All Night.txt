INT BUICK LESABRE MOVING — PHILADELPHIA — NIGHT A Phillies baseball game broadcast is heard on the radio

PLAY-BY-PLAY ANNOUNCER
--Here’s the 2-1 to Dykstra Low and
away ball 3 Dykstra’s one for two on
the night He singled in the first and
grounded into a fielder’s choice

JIMMY CONLON early 30s sits behind the wheel a cigarette
dangling from his lips as he listens to the play-by-play His
ruddy Irish face is roughened and broken like that a
heavyweight boxer who never knew when to throw in the towel

Up ahead red lights glow as a CADILLAC DEVILLE brakes and
steers toward the curb Jimmy follows parking at a distance

Two men step out of the Deville dressed in suits SHAWN
MAGUIRE 30s and his consigliere PAT MULLEN 30s

Shawn approaches Jimmy rolls the window down and Shawn leans
in He’s handsome tough savagely loyal The type of leader
youd follow anywhere And Jimmy does

SHAWN
We’re gonna get the parents now You
all set ace

Jimmy nods Shawn smiles as sharp as a new penny playfully
slaps Jimmy’s cheek then goes

Jimmy watches as Shawn and Pat approach a duplex and knock on
the front door An ELDERLY COUPLE answers Shawn shakes the
man’s hand and gentlemanly helps the woman down the steps
The four enter the Cadillac and it cruises off

Jimmy goes to work now Shuts off the radio Stubs out his
cigarette Slides on leather gloves Opens the glove
compartment and removes a STAINLESS STEEL SW1911 45 ACP
PISTOL Tucks it into his black leather coat and —

EXT STREET — CONTINUOUS

Jimmy strides toward the home we saw the Elderly Couple exit
Down the alley between homes Into the BACKYARD now and

-Abruptly he’s INSIDE THE HOUSE walking up the STAIRS
with the pistol in his hand He can hear a SHOWER RUNNING and
starts down the hall in that direction and

--into a BEDROOM A fusty antiquated decor Paintings of
Jesus Christ the Virgin Mary a crucifix on the wall The
Phillies game plays on the television The sound of the
shower gets LOUDER and LOUDER AND LOUDER as he moves into
-the BATHROOM Thick with steam Impossible to see The
water so fucking loud now like a WATERFALL CRASHING and —

Jimmy RIPS the shower curtain back A gaunt tattooed man
BILLY COUGHLIN 30 startles covers himself

BILLY
What the fuck

And now he sees Jimmy and he knows Jimmy and he knows what
he’s come here for and he’s really fucking scared and

BILLY (CONTD)
Jimmy J-Jimmy please no —

Jimmy RAISES the pistol

BILLY (CONT’D)
But Jimmy I-I’ve been good — I’ve
been so good Jimmy — I’ve —

BLAM Jimmy FIRES Right between the eyes Billy COLLAPSES to
the floor of the tub like he doesn’t have bones But
strangely he doesn’t die Instead he feels at the hole
between his eyes and the river of blood racing down his face
and he begins to LAUGH

Jimmy raises the pistol again — BLAM BLAM — two bullets RIP
HOLES in Billy’s chest He FLOPS AROUND like a fish out of
water GASPING horribly for airbut it’s all a big joke

Jimmy FIRES the pistol over and over but it only serves to
make Billy LAUGH LOUDER MORE MANIACALLY as if he’s being
tickled by the bullets and —

INT THE ABBEY PUB — FISHTOWN PHILADELPHIA — (PRESENT DAY)

Jimmy wakes with a start Breathless and flush He takes a
moment to let his nightmare ebb away and then sits up in the
booth and reaches for a box of Marlboros Lights one and
sucks in a long soothing drag There that’s better

He’s in his late forties now and the years since he worked as
hitman for Shawn Maguire haven’t been kind to him Scraggly
four-day beard Eyes stung with exhaustion and glassy from
too-much booze

The place is decorated for the holidays and Burl Ives sings
‘Holly Jolly Christmas’ on the jukebox Rough and profane
IRISHMEN of all ages play pool shoot the breeze at the bar
toss darts This is home base for Shawn’s crew

MANS VOICE (0C)
Hey Conlon

Jimmy looks over at FRANK DORSEY 30s a bulky arrogant
bruiser sitting on a stool among a group of ROUGHNECKS
FRANK
You were fartin’ in your sleep again
yunno

JIMMY
How the fuck would I know that I was
sleepin’

FRANK

You oughta try them geriatric diapers
In case ya shit yourself

Roughnecks SNICKER

JIMMY
(mutters under his breath)
Go fuck your mothers

Jimmy grabs a bottle of Bud Two gulps in he realizes it’s
full of cigarette butts He SPITS the beer out in a huge
spray all over his sweatshirt

JIMMY (CONTD)
Fuckin’ — motherfuckin’ shit

Frank and Roughnecks LAUGH

The rear door opens Jimmy watches as COLIN MAGUIRE 27
brash and irresponsible enters with two plainclothes
detectives JASON SAYERS 40s white boyishly handsome and
TERRY NANCE 40s black wiry

The three duck into a back office
REAR HALLWAY — MINUTES LATER

Jimmy waits outside the BACK OFFICE Inside Colin finishes
telling Sayers and Nance a joke

COLIN

COLIN
(with disdain)

Sayers and Nance exit the office tossing a glare in Jimmy’s
direction on their way out the back door

Colin still hasn’t noticed Jimmy He sits behind the desk
dumps a baggy of cocaine onto a mirror Razorblades a line
and SNORTS a bump He looks restless and edgy

Jimmy KNOCKS Startled Colin looks up

COLIN (CONTD)
Jesus Christ Can I get one fuckin’
moment to myself Whaddayou want

JIMMY
(stepping inside)
I talked to your dad this mornin’ The
furnace blew over at my place Told me

Colin shakes his head in disgust pulls out a roll of cash

COLIN (CONTD)

COLIN

JIMMY

Colin offers Jimmy the cash When Jimmy reaches for it Colin
pulls it back reconsidering a smirk curling

COLIN

He points to a SANTA CLAUS COSTUME hanging on a closet door

COLIN (CONT’D)
McCauley’s fat ass cancelled on me

JIMMY
No Fuck that I gotta get home

COLIN
(pulls the cash away)
Fair enough Get home and freeze your

Off Jimmy looking at the suit then the cash

glances back at Tony who mouths Don’t Do It

INT MIKE’S LIMOUSINE MOVING — EARLY EVENING
SPORTS TALK on the RADIO Mike drives stealing glances at
Vick in the rearview who is busy texting on his Blackberry
Mike’s eyes shift to the passenger seat where’s he placed the
two just-purchased footballs alongside a Sharpie pen
A CALLER on the RADIO becomes prominent
CALLER (VO)

EXT MAGUIRE HOME — FISHTOWN — ESTABLISHING — NIGHT

Like every other row home on the street A bit nicer but not
much Through the windows we see a HOLIDAY PARTY underway
MANS VOICE (VO)
I’m told you’re the Prince of the
City Mr Maguire That you have
friends in all the places one could
hope to have friends

INT MAGUIRE HOME — OFFICE — NIGHT

CLOSE ON SHAWN MAGUIRE sitting behind a large mahogany desk
He’s 50 years old now and he’s aged as well as any man could
hope to We hear the sounds of the party outside the door

SHAWN
You shouldn’t believe everything you
hear I’m a simple man I grew up in
this house My father sat behind this
desk The guests just outside that
door I’ve known since I was a boy

Across from Shawn sits STEVAN KUJOVIC 30s an impeccably
dressed Serbian His bodyguard GORAN 40 hangs by the door
Never far from Shawn’s side PAT MULLEN stands nearby

KUJOVIC
Either way I’d like to make an
arrangement with you

PAT
What’s in it for us

KUJOVIC
Money of course A million up-front

He sets a leather briefcase on the desk and opens it Shawn
glances at the STACKS OF CASH inside

KUJOVIC (CONTD)
After that you’ll receive twenty
percent of all the product you allow
to pass safely through the port

Kujovic reaches into his jacket and removes a small baggy of
cocaine

KUJOVIC (CONTD)
(re the cocaine)
My associates have a name for it
Virgin 99 percent pure The very best
in the world

Shawn mulls the cash a moment seemingly impressed Then

SHAWN
The business has changed Mr Kujovic
The mob’s dead Last week the Feds
arrested two members of what’s left of
the Gambino Family They were driving
sixteen year old girls to New Jersey
to have sex in short-stays while they
collected half the hourly fuck rate

(MORE )
SHAWN (CONTD)

Twenty years ago I made a living the
same way we all did A few big scores
a year but mostly I was a grinder
You wanted to lay down on a few ball
games you came to me You wanted to
open a butcher shop and the bank said
fuck-you on the loan you came to me
Know what that butcher shop is today

(pause for effect)
An Applebees

KUJOVIC
Why are you telling me this

SHAWN
Because there’s no money in that
business anymore I’ve had to adapt
Find other ways to make a living But
I don’t deal in drugs Know why

KUJOVIC
Enlighten me

SHAWN
It’s a whore’s business And the pimps
like you that bring that poison to the
streets are worse than those two
guineas peddling underage pussy at the
Econo Lodge D’you understand me

The two men stare at each other an anxious moment then

KUJOVIC
I think this meeting is over

PAT
Good observation

Silently livid Kujovic closes the briefcase and stands He
and Goran move to exit Before they can

SHAWN
One more thing
(Kujovic turns back)
Whoever told you I had friends in this
city was right Make sure I never hear
your name again

Kujovic dismisses the threat with a smirk then goes

INT FAMILY ROOM — NIGHT

The Annual Maguire Family Holiday Party The space is crowded
with FAMILY FRIENDS SENIOR MEMBERS OF THE GANG and their
YOUNG CHILDREN GIFTS are scattered around a CHRISTMAS TREE

He’s referring to Kujovic who is making his way towards them

COLIN

Kujovic arrives Colin excitedly offers him a shot of vodka

COLIN (CONTD)

But Kujovic doesn’t accept the shot He just stares at Colin

KUJOVIC

KUJOVIC
I paid you to guarantee your father’s
support —

COLIN

KUJOVIC

Colin sees it burning in Kujovic’s eyes the threat very
real Kujovic and Goran leave

Off Colin confused angry
INT STUDY — NIGHT
Colin storms in and marches up to his father’s desk
COLIN
Kujovic just walked out What’d you

COLIN
Did you even fuckin’ listen to what he
had to say

PAT
Colin that’s not our business —

COLIN
(WHIPS to Pat sharply)
You shut your mouth I’m talkin’ to my
father

Pat nods backs off

SHAWN
What’s the problem Colin

COLIN
The problem is all I ever hear outta
your mouth is when am I gonna pull my
weight So now I bring in a piece of
business — a good piece of business —

SHAWN
And youre mad I just let it walk out
the door

COLIN
Yeah

SHAWN
If I listened to every good piece of
business you brought in I’d be livin’
in the basement of Saint Anne’s
Church stealing crumbs from the mice

Pat stifles a laugh Colin feels small
SHAWN (CONT’D)
(dismissive patronizing)
Now go have another drink

Abruptly Colin grabs Shawn’s highball of scotch and FIRES it
against the wall behind his father’s head It SHATTERS

Shawn doesn’t so much as flinch

Colin stares at his father a long moment So much rage in
those eyes Been building for years

COLIN
When are you gonna take me seriously

And with that Shawn realizes just how deep this goes Colin
KICKS over a chair and storms off As he passes Pat

COLIN (CONT’D)

PALE-HORSE PUNCH to Jimmy’s face Jimmy WHEELS BACKWARDS into
the trash can collapses to the floor Tired bloodied done

Frank REMOVES an HK P30 PISTOL from the waist of his jeans
and starts towards Jimmy as —

Jimmy inconspicuously SLIPS the belt off his trousers and as
Frank raises the pistol and —

WHAP Jimmy WHIPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE with the belt buckle
Frank DROPS the pistol doubles over holding his eye

FRANK
Fuck — you MOTHERFUCKER —

Jimmy’s on his feet — WRAPS the belt around Frank’s neck like
a garrotte — PULLING IT SO FUCKING TIGHT and —

Frank FIGHTS HIM LIKE A BULL — wheeling backwards — then
forward — SLAMMING JIMMY INTO THE STALLS and AGAINST THE WALL
— HIS FACE AN INFERNO and —

Jimmys knuckles whiten — teeth clench tighter — mining every
ounce of strength left in his wearied bones

Until finally Frank’s strength wanes resistance
flags he COLLAPSES over the sinks and DIES

Jimmy lets him down Takes a moment to find his breath Seems
on the verge of collapse and has to steady himself against
the wall

MIKE

A few silent moments pass Only the sound of 1060 NEWSRADIO
The ANCHOR tells of plummeting temperatures It’s suggested
the elderly stay inside

MIKE (CONTD)
She would still ask for you yunno
That used to drive me crazy Id be in
the hospital room with her and all of
a sudden she’d say Oh Michael I just
wish your father was here And
later when she got really sick shed
wake up in the middle of the night
calling your name

JIMMY
Your mother and I were together a long
time They weren’t all bad years

MIKE
Didn’t you ever think about comin’ by
I mean just to say hello see how

she was doin’ watch a stupid
goddamn tv show for all I care That
never crossed your mind

JIMMY
I watched my father go that way Took
him five years to die By the end he
weighed a hundred and ten pounds
(shakes his head)
Promised myself I’d never go through
that again

MIKE
Well good for you You kept your
promise And she died alone

JIMMY
You thought she deserved someone
better I guess I can understand that

MIKE
No that’s not it I just wanted her
to hate you the way I hated you

INT HOMIDCIDE UNIT — 750 RACE — NIGHT

TIGHT ON an article in the Philadelphia Inquirer from 1995
PICK UP WORDS In a stunning verdict Jimmy ‘The Gravedigger’
Conlon was acquitted of the murders

Cu (PHOTO in article) JIMMY 30s here in a courtroom
hugging Shawn following the not guilty verdict

CU (bg of same PHOTO) HARDING early 30s in the rear of
the courtroom standing beside his ex-partner TORNETTA
apoplectic with rage

ON HARDING

At his desk scanning the article behind reading glasses
Feeling weirdly nostalgic The night dredging up memories

FLORES (0C)
Son’s cleaner than Mr Rogers

Pulled from his reverie Harding tucks the article into a
drawer Spins his chair to Flores at the neighboring desk

HARDING
No priors

FLORES
Not even a parking ticket I talked to
one’a his co-workers Said he enrolled
in business courses up at Temple
Wanted to get outta the late-night-no-
holiday hacking life

Harding slips off his glasses reclines thinking

HARDING

Young father trying to make a better
life for his family suddenly goes on a
cop-killing rampage with an old man
he’s tellin’ everyone is dead

(shakes his head it

doesn’t compute)
Who called it in

FLORES
(reading the dispatch log)
Michael Told dispatch his father shot
and killed a man in the kitchen

HARDING
So why does he run when the cops get
there
(Flores shrugs beats me)
Lemme see the log

Flores hands it to Harding Harding reads confused then
troubled by what he doesn’t see He abruptly grabs his
overcoat off his chair —

HARDING (CONT’D)
Come on

Flores LEAPS UP wiggles into his coat then hurries to catch
up to Harding who’s already out the door

ATTENDANT They arrive at a door Pat waits outside as Shawn
enters the room

---COLIN’S BODY lies on a metal table Shawn approaches and
stands over him absorbing the finality of this moment

That’s Colin That’s my son

Shawn slips his hand out of his overcoat pocket and gently
runs his fingers over his son’s face as if to memorize its
features

INT HOSPITAL CAFETERIA — NIGHT

Shawn and Pat sip cups of coffee as they wait to sign papers

Shawn shakes his head ‘no’

SHAWN
When I was sixteen Richie Conners
called me over to his house
(MORE )

SHAWN (CONTD)
He knew I was pullin’ small jobs here
and there and he asked me if I wanted
to come work for him Don’t make a
decision now he said Go home Sleep
on it Come back and see me in the
morning Here’s what I want you to
think about There are two types of
men in this world The first man gets
up in the morning and goes to work for
someone He works hard to make a
decent living for his wife and his
children Everyone calls him a friend
When he dies a funeral is given The
family gathers and stories are told
about what a nice simple decent man
he was Then they go home and go on
about their lives The second man
knows no boss He lives recklessly and
boldly making enemies and hurting the
ones he loves When he dies he is
blessed and cursed in equal measure
Parties are thrown to celebrate his
life others to rejoice in his death
His enemies toast that they’1ll never
have to see him again But those that
love him wonder how they’1ll ever live
without him I didn’t sleep that
whole night I knocked on his door at
six the next morning

Pat looks at him curiously Off Pat’s look an explanation

SHAWN (CONT’D)
Earlier I was tryin’ to remember the
moment when the boy went wrong

INT CITY BUS MOVING — NIGHT

TIGHT ON JIMMY as the bus rattles down Cottman Avenue He
seems somewhere else And he’s muttering to himself Or
rather to the demons inside him

JIMMY

against the window It’s been a long night such a long
night all that adrenaline ebbing away now he closes his
eyes he could sleep forever

The BUS arrives at a stop Riders stand and move to exit The
bus rocks into motion again

INT THOMAS JEFFERSON HOSPITAL — NIGHT

A quiet corridor A few second shift NURSES milling about
The elevator arrives and Jimmy steps off Makes his way down
the hall peering into open patient rooms looking for his
mother All the while noticing the ‘get-well’ flowers and
gifts surrounding the patients and feeling a bit guilty he’s
come here empty-handed

He spots a poinsettia plant on the vacant check-in desk and
quickly snatches it tucking it under his arm as he continues
down the hall He scans the placards outside each room
stopping finally outside one MARGARET CONLON

INT HOSPITAL ROOM — NIGHT

Jimmy searches a closet Empty Moves to the door now and
calls out to the hallway

sleeve into his palm

He slowly walks toward Jimmy who lowers his gun

SHAWN (CONTD)

(moving closer)
God it must be fifteen years since I
saw the boy

Just as Shawn’s about to reach Jimmy Jimmy RAISES HIS GUN —
BLAM THE PISTOL’S REPORT ECHOES FOR MILES

For a moment Shawn doesn’t react Slowly now blood begins
to seep through his shirt A crimson blotch He crumples to
the cold pavement

Jimmy nears looks down at his friend whose breaths are short
and shallow He STEPS on Shawn’s hand The knife falls from
his grip Jimmy reaches down and tosses it into the darkness

He tucks the pistol away now and sits beside Shawn and pulls
him into his arms and holds him like a child

JIMMY
I’m sorry Shawn I did it for my
son I did it for Michael

Shawn looks up at Jimmy There’s no anger evident in his
eyes Only regret Something the two men know well

Shawn tries to speak but the words don’t come He reaches his
hand up and PATS Jimmy’s cheek Forgiveness

The wind picks up

Jimmy takes off his flannel coat lays it over Shawn’s body
As Shawn fights for his final breaths Jimmy stills him
holds his hand

JIMMY (CONTD)
It’s okay it’s almost over now

Shawns eyes narrow then slowly close the light goes
out of him and he crosses that line

Jimmy doesn’t get up right away He stays there for a very
long while holding his friend in his arms keeping him warm

Drew and the girls exit the cabin Before Mike leaves he
turns back to Jimmy

MIKE (CONT’D)
I’m glad you got to meet them

JIMMY
Me too

Mike goes

Jimmy is alone Physically and emotionally drained He moves
to the sink and pours himself a glass of water Drinks it in
a single gulp Ahhhh He runs his burnt hand under the cold
water and watches the water move through his calloused
fingers before finally shutting the faucet off

He paces around when he notices the COLLAGE Sarah was making
for the new baby on the kitchen table ‘US BEFORE YOU’ It’s
finished now Every inch of canvas covered

He looks at it curiously a moment Sits at the table now and
peers down at the pictures So many A mosaic of moments fit
together to tell a family’s life

JIMMYS POV

The pictures Catelyn’s birth Lily’s first bath birthdays
holidays Halloween costumes bike rides etc A lifetime
of happy memories

JIMMY

His eyes well with tears

JIMMYS POV

VERY TIGHT ON the faces of Sarah Catelyn Lily Mike

VERY TIGHT ON JIMMY

It hits him all at once everything he missed everything

he wasn’t And it just breaks him it just fucking
shatters him into a million pieces

His stomach quakes

JIMMY
Oh God Oh God

Tears roll down his face

We stay on Jimmy for a very long while fighting like hell to
hold it together

Until

-something strange happens Looking at the photos again he
realizes his son isn’t him that his sins are his own

And a great relief washes over him

His whole body slackens as if a great weight has been lifted
He gathers himself and moves to the back door Through a pane
of glass he watches his family down by the lake Walking
along the water’s edge The girls pointing at the ducks

BOOSH THE GLASS DOOR PANEL SHATTERS

SIX BULLETS RIP INTO HIS CHEST

He REELS BACK — tries to steady himself against the kitchen
table — but his legs give out and he COLLAPSES to the floor

Through the shattered panel WE SEE PRICE OUTSIDE A haunting
visage The left side of his face covered with crimson-tinged
bandages His glasses are cracked and askew Like a figure
from a nightmare figure come horribly to life

AT THE LAKE’S EDGE

Mike HEARS the dull echo of gunshots He looks upward to the
cabin but can’t see anything through the dense woods

MIKE
(to Sarah)
Take the girls
SARAH
Mike —
MIKE
Go Now

Sarah grabs Catelyn and Lily and rushes off

Mike runs back toward the cabin

PRICE

clicks another magazine into his FIVE-SEVEN PISTOL then
coolly starts down the wooded slope towards the lake to
fulfill the second half of his charge

INT CABIN — JIMMY

clutching his bloody chest He drags himself across the
kitchen floor leaving a streak of blood on the linoleum

Grunting through unbearable pain he PICKS himself up opens
the closet door and removes a KIMBER CLASSIC HUNTING RIFLE

INT DODGE CHARGER — DRIVEWAY — HARDING AND FLORES

Flores notices Price walking through the woods down towards
the water

FLORES
Who the hell is that

Harding lifts his eyes and observes Price making his descent
He LEAPS OUT of the car and —

INT KITCHEN — JIMMY

-308 WINCHESTER CARTRIDGES FALL TO THE FLOOR as Jimmy loads
the Kimber rifle He STAGGERS to the back door and KICKS IT
OPEN Steadies himself against the frame — tries to focus

— but he’s dazed — fading — so much blood lost

He RAISES THE RIFLE — narrows an eye and —

BLAM

Kingfisher birds flee a tree

A CRIMSON ERUPTION FLASHES OFF PRICE’S SHOULDER

PRICE

FALTERS leans against a prodigious pine and calmly appraises
the gaping wound and exposed tendons and bone of his
shoulder Blood runs down his right arm which hangs limply at

his side like a flaccid noodle He can’t move it

Undaunted he reaches over with his left hand and takes the
pistol and trudges forward as —

MIKE

begins to SCURRY UP THE STEEP SLOPE when he notices Price
Just ten yards away He FREEZES

PRICE

raises his left arm levels the pistol at Mike when —
BLAM BLAM

TWO BULLETS RIP THROUGH PRICE’S CHEST

He PITCHES FORWARD and TUMBLES HEADLONG down the rock-ribbed
slope coming to rest finally on a slab of rock dead

Mike scans for the source

HARDING APPEARS AT THE CREST OF THE SLOPE pistol still
trained on Price waiting for any movement

Finally

HARDING
Everyone alright down there

Mike takes a moment to find his breath Then it hits him
Jimmy He RACES UP to check on his father —

MIKE
Dad

He SLIPS on the wet soil and slides all the way down to the
bottom and gets to his feet unfazed and RUNS BACK UP even
more desperately than before grabbing at shrubs grabbing at
anything he can and —

MIKE (CONTD)
DAD ANSWER ME

TIGHT ON JIMMY

Very near death Slumped against the frame of the back door
The rifle on the ground beside him His breaths get quieter
and quieter until they’re barely audible

His life doesn’t flash before his eyes

There’s no tunnel or white light

He just dies

A gust of wind tousles the dead man’s hair
The wind HOWLS
The screams of the dead

FADE OUT
INT MIKE’S ROW HOME — KITCHEN — MORNING
Frost on the windows Snow blankets the ground outside
Through the entryway we see Mike come down the stairs He
plugs in the Christmas tree lights Opens the front door and
lifts the morning newspaper Bats the snow off and crosses
into the kitchen now
He shivers from the cold starts a pot of coffee
Moves to the kitchen table now It’s littered with textbooks
— Business Law Accounting Finance — still open from his

study session last night

He closes the texts stacks them on the counter and takes a
seat at the table

WE SLOWLY PUSH IN ON MIKE as he opens the newspaper leafs
through absently Then something captures his interest
