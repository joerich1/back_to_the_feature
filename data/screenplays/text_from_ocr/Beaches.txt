TITLE SEQUENCE
EXT CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT - THE PRESENT

It is snowing hard A BUM is pawing through and trashcan
limos and taxis line the street waiting for the crowd to
emerge DRIVERS stand under the overhang talking to each
other From inside the theater we hear thunderous app-
jause The poster and marquee simply read BLOOM in
large black letters

INT CARNEGIE HALL NIGHT

CC BLOOM at forty-one has the figure of a thirty-year-
old and a wild explosion of red hair surrounds her arrest-
ing face like a lions mane She is dressed in a perfect
black evening gown and is spotlit standing in the center

of an otherwise empty stage taking bows to a standing
ovation from an opening night CROWD She exhudes a brash
outrageous and completely engaging charm

ce
(into microphone)
fhank you Thank you

As the applause continues she loses her composure and
starts pacing the stage with excitement a brilliant smile
on her face

ce

You people are too much
You make being alive worth
the excercise

(applause con-

tinues)
If you calm down Ill ao
one more song but thats
it Im getting old Ill
be thirty on my next birthday

Laughter then a silence so profound you could hear a
pin drop CC nods at the CONDUCTOR then we hear the in-
troduction to SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME CC sings the song

in a pure rich voice her phrasing original and moving
2

When the song ends she leaves the stage to and standing
ovation

INT WINGS - CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

PEOPLE close in on CC to congratulate her As she moves
slowly through the crowd the STAGE MANAGER pushes his way
to her and hands her a piece of paper

STAGE MANAGER
Phone message CC

cc is still accepting congratulations from people as she
unfolds the paper ’

EXT CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

Snow falls in a thick white cloud PEOPLE are still ex-
iting the theater climbing into limos and taxis Unnoticed
by the crowd CC rushes from the building now in street
clothes still pulling on her fur coat and scarf An empty
taxi is cruising past She runs down the street after

it grabs the door handle sliding dangerously in the snow
and runs along with it for a few feet until it skids to

a halt As she pulls the door open and slides into the
back seat

cc
(urgent)
La Guardia please Bos-
ton Shuttle

The door slams shut behind her
INT TAXI - NiGHT

As ‘the DRIVER starts to pull away he suddenly turns to
look at her with a frown

DRIVER
Hey Arent you

ce
No

He shrugs and goes back to his driving CC leans her head
against the window and stares out at the falling snow
anxiously The only sound is the driver talking softly to
the dispatcher over the radio tires moving over the cushion
of snow and the windshield wipers slapping back and forth
Slowly the sound of people at a beach bleeds in

and suggestive gestures sings in a strong pure voice

ec

adult make-up and in hearing a fully developed voice emerge

charming smile

We were looking everywhere

HILLARY
But CC and I are having a soda

CC who has been staring at Hillarys mother as if she is
a goddess comes around and stands up awkwardly

cc
Hey forget it If I dont
go back Leonall start foam-
ing at the mouth anyway

As Hillary gets up her mother takes her hand and smiles
at CC Vesta is fumbling in her purse

MOTHER
Thank you for looking after
my girl

As they turn away Vesta suddenly shoves some bills into
ccs hand with distaste

cc
(taken aback)
Whats this for

VESTA
(disapproving)
It keeps people like you
honest

As Vesta walks after Hillary and Hillarys mother Hillary
suddenly looks back over her shoulder at CC

HILLARY
(bright excited)
Be sure to keep in touch
CC okay

cc
Well sure were friends

Hillary doesnt hear as she vanishes down the steps with
her mother and Vesta CC looks after them with longing for
a moment then looks down at the money in her hand The
waiter arrives and she suddenly shoves the money into his
pocket

WAITER
(taken aback)
Whats this for

ce
(teugh cocky)
It keeps people like you
honest buddy

As she walks off toward the stairs her taps clicking
cheerfully on the marble floor her step quickly turns

into a defiant little walking dance which attracts the
stares of everyone she passes When she reaches the top

of the stairs all eyes upon her she suddenly breaks into
quick combination step as if she is exiting a stage then
taps her way lightly down the marble stairs until she dis-
appears from sight

INT ENTRY OF EPISCOPAL CHURCH - BOSTON - RAINY DAY
Two years older dressed in black and looking as if she

has been erying Hillary stands next to the closed street
door reading a letter As she reads we hear

cc

(v0)
Leona wont let me go to
Julliard so I have to
keep taking dancing lessons
from Miss Jean Kayton the
freaky fat vaudeville star
Her studios in the cellar
which means you only graduate
when youre tall enough to
hit your hea on the ceiling
Whats a genius like me doing
in a place like this By
the way Im sorry your mothers
sick Is she better

At that moment the door to the street is abruptly pulled
open A handsome man in his forties also dressed in black
and looking shattered stands under an umbrella on the steps
At the curb we see a coffin being slipped into the back of
a hearse which is surrounded by a group of MOURNERS under
umbrellas Hillary stares at the vision with a stunned
frightened face then carefully folds CC‘s letter and puts
it into her pocket takes her fathers hand and walks out
into the rain

INT SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
It is decorated for a dance and packed with teenagers danc-
ing a slow dance to recorded rock and roll Looking un-
happy CC stands with a group of unattractive girls at the
base of the stage near the refreshments table Her clothes
are too tight fa her voluptuous body so make her look fat
her curly hair is crushed to her head with clips and her
make-up is designed to exaggerate her worst features

She clearly has no idea of what she looks like but sus-
pects it is not good As she reads a letter we hear

HILLARY

(v0)
Ive definitely decided
on Vassar You asked what
Im going to be when I grow
up I have a feeling Im go-
ing to be my father He never
lets me out of his sight since
my mother died

During this a boy walks up to the group The girls look
at him hopefully including CC “His eyes meet hers she
smiles invitingly he stares for a moment longer then
turns and walks away She sighs with despair as she goes
back to the letter

HILLARY

(v0)
By the way I really res-
pect your decision to de-
dicate your life to art in-
atead of boys That kind of
sacrifice shows great charac-
ter

EXT VASSAR CAMPUS - SUNNY SPRING DAY - 1968

Hillary now a stunningly beautiful woman walks slowly
across the lawn toward a building in a crowd of STUDENTS
carrying books and clumsily writing a letter She has the
kind of fresh intelligent face that will still be beautiful
in old age bones that promise character and an innate

grace that expresses itself effortlessly

HILLARY

(v0)
Its not the same for me
I dont have your talent
which is why Ive decided
to stay in Boston and take
the job in my uncles law
firm Drawing up wills and
issolving marriages is bor-
ing no matter where you do it

The place is decorated for Christmas and packed with SHOPPERS
A special display features an excercise bed a double bed
mattress which vibrates and undulates simultaneously

CC wearing a negligee and writing a letter is strapped to
the mattress oblivious to the stares of the buying public
Gone is the insecure teenager and in her place is a striking
woman with a lush body and a great mane of blinding red hair
cc the adult knows what she looks like and makes the most of
it

(v0)
Forgive the writing

cc (contd)
(v0)

while making a special

cided to live even though I

The sound of a train station bleeds in
INT PENN STATION - PLATFORM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A DISCARDED TIMETABLE as many feet walk over it

Tucked safely in the bosom
of your family

As a very expensive pair of womans boots walk over it
CAMERA MOVES UP AND BACK AND FOLLOWS HILLARY as she makes
her way with the crowd toward the main terminal building
She is struggling with a few pieces of expensive luggage
and has a crumpled Boston Globe jammed under her arm She
is dressed in conservative but stylish clothes - mans
cashmere coat wool challis skirt silk shirt etc

INT PENN STATION MAIN TERMINAL - NIGHT

Hillary quickly walks to a bank of pay phones an anxious
look on her face takes a great pile of change from her
purse lights a cigarette hungrily then feeds change into
the phone and dials a long distance number The phone
rings then

HILLARY

She hangs up tosses her Boston Globe dramatically into

a nearby trashcan and resumes her journey to the street
with her luggage anxiety replaced by an excited determina-
tion

INT SEEDY PIANO BAR MID-TOWN MANHATTAN - NIGHT

Wearing a skin-tight thirties evening gown a huge fake er-
mine boa and lots of rhinestone jewelry CC sings GOOD MORN-
ING HEARTACHE to an indifferent crowd accompanied on the
piano At one table a drunken couple talk and laugh loudly
at another a woman sobs next to a man who sits with his face
in his hands at the bar businessmen are hustled by hookers
etc Although CC has a desperate look on her face she

sings honestly and from the heart to her dismal audience
When the song ends she waits expectantly but nothing happens
She smiles slightly and bows

cc

Thank you thank you
Youre too too kind

INT PIANO BAR OFFICE - NIGHT

The wom is more like a dirty little broom closet than
an office and a gay man of forty HARRY with a tired ruined
face is counting money into a strong-box when CC walks in

carrying Hillarys luggage approach the lighted doorway

of a loft building CC is now wearing a huge second-

hand fur and English riding boots and Hillary is looking

INT CCS LOFT - NIGHT
Hillary and CC walk in and drop the luggage on the floor

ce
(bright)
So What do you think

Hillary slowly looks around the room which except for a
few rudimentary pieces of furniture and a storm of dis
carded clothes is bare and gives the impression it is in
a bombed-out building A jerry-built kitchen stretches
along a wall beneath a row of large dirty uncurtained
windows looking out on the empty street Hillary suddenly
bursts into tears

ce
(offended)
Hey So its not Buck-
ingham Palace Its home

then slips the muzzle on her face Inside we hear a couple
of crashes and number of locks being undone and the door is
finally pulled open by JOHN CHASE an extremely attractive
intense-looking man in his early thirties who looks as if
he just woke up from a sound sleep after a very late night
He is barefoot and wearing hastily pulled on jeans and t-
shirt She smiles brightly

Hed stuck a revolver into

his mouth and fired so that

the back of his head had been -
blown away It was because on
the dance fleor - unable to stop
myself - Id suddenly said “I

And then the searchlight which
had been turned on the world
was turned off again and never
for one moment since has there
been any light stronger than this
kitchen candle

There is a pause then she looks up anxiously and slowly
lowers the script John stares at her

He turns and walks out of the restaurant She watches
him go with an anxious expression on her face then looks
down at the script as if it is going to attack her She
finally takes a deep breath and as she opens it to read
‘she suddenly blesses herself then throwa up her hand in
exasperation

up and costumed CC sings the final song a show-stopper
which includes the entire chorus When the song ends the
theater ‘suddenly goes completely dark then the houselights
go up and the audience composed primarily of downtown
types and a sprinkling of critics goes crazy The entire
company is assembled onstage with CC at the center of the
line As the applause continues undiminished they bow
deeply then as CC straightens up CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE ON
HER The actors on eitherside of her gently prod her for-
ward so she is standing alone just in front of the line
and the applause turns into cheers and a standing ovation
She suddenly breaks into a smile her face lit with wild
excitement and triumph CC is finally on her way

HILLARY

turns back to Hillary

JOHN

cc
(snapping)

Well is it or isn‘t it

Hillary slams the nail polish down a Little too hard
HILLARY
No its not It makes

They walk on in silence for a moment trying to put and
damper on their tempers Hillary picks up a hat and

tries it on

cc
Oh Hill look Isnt this

HILLARY
Very sweet
(unguarded)

Absolutely Having children
is the most important thing
to me Id feel incomplete
without them

cc
I know what you mean

HILLARY
(surprised)
You do

cc
(defensive)
Sure I do Way wouldnt I

HILLARY
(superior)
I justdidnt think someone
like you would care about
children Youre so obsessed
with your career and all

ce
(shar p)
I am not obsessed and just
because I work doesnt mean
that “someone like me doesnt
want kids

HILLARY
(sharper)
Wanting them and caring for
them properly are two differ-
ent things Having children
is a full time job

c¢
(hard)
For some people

HILLARY
(ha rder)
Yes The ones who take the
responsibility seriously and
dont just have children to
gratify their overweaning egos

voice

HISLARY
(furious)
I could say the same about you

ce
(superior)
Ive simply been reacting to you

HILLARY
(sudden cold)

Oh for Gods sake CC
dont you get it We have
nothing in common anymore
It happens to the best of
friends and its happened
to us Weve grown apart
and its time to accept it

ee
Youre wrong We havent
grown apart Youve fallen
apart

HILLARY
(icey)
I dont think I want to
pursue this
(turning heading
for exit)
So long CC Take care

ce

(sudden loud)
Oh no you dont you
stuck-up little witch
Youre not getting off
that easy

(going after

her angry)
When your father died he
took the best of you with
him my old friend

(grabbing her arm

turning her)
You tried to be an interest-
ing person for a while but
you couldnt take the heat
At the first sign of trouble
you caved in reverted back to
type Youre nothing but
a tight-assed small-minded
little snob these days

HILLARY
(low vicious)
How would a pretentious little
climber like you know that

ec
(harsh)
Experience And I know whats
eathing you too Plain old-
fashioned jealousy
HILLARY
(contemptuous)
Jealousy Of what Your raw

ambition Your new money
Your marriage of convenience

cc

wounded)

HILLARY
(furious)

Every time John looks at me
you come apart at the seams
Whats the problem Are you
afraid he doesnt love you
Ave you afraid you got him by
default

cc stares at her

cc

(low even)
Maybe I am but at least I
belong to myself which is
more than I can say for you
Im doing what I want to do ©
remember Free at last free
at last Im living the life
you wanted to live but didnt
have the courage for 80 dont
tell me youre not jealous Youre

staring at her She casually pretends to examine some

stockings but as she picks them up her hand is shaking

ing contents Letters and photographs litter the floor
An urgent look on her face Hillary drops the box to the
floor and rips the top open She starts rummaging fran-
tically around inside looking for something tossing
things to the floor impatiently A moment passes then
CC appears in the doorway rubbing her eyes suntanned
and wearing a huge t-shirt

things strewn on the floor

She suddenly sits heavily on the bed and puts her hands
over her face -

HILLARY
(desperate)
Im so scared CC Im

CC watches helplessly as Hillary rocks back and forth

Slightly her face covered CC suddenly kneels down and
starts going through the photographs As she empties
another box onte the floor Hillary finally lowers her
hands from her face and takes a deep breath She watches
cc for a moment then kneels down next to her and without
a word also starts to go through the photographs They
work side by side in silence then CC finally holds out a
picture to her

INT VICTORIAS BEDROOM - MORNING

Most of her things are carefully packed away in boxes

She is sitting in a small chair looking around the room
with wide frightened eyes wearing her coat hat and
boots Through the window we can see that the street is
covered by a deep layer of snow the parked cars are
half-buried and more snow is falling Her cat is curled up
in her lap A moment passes then

Victoria hesitates then gets up puts the cat in ‘his
case takes one last hungry look around her room picks
up the case and a small suitcase and walks out

two suitcases in her hands as Victoria comes down the
stairs The furniture has been covered by dust sheets
and the place has an abandoned look to it

of blocks for a taxi Can

Victoria nods’ pauses at the door to look around sence with
confused eyes then she turns and walks out CC also hesi-
tates looking around the hall and remembering happier times
in that house then she walks out and pulls the door shut
behind her The lock clicks
